<p><b>Overview:</b> The DLPS workflow for creating full TEI headers
requires certain software to be present on the user's local PC. This
document details the requirements.</p>

<hr>

<ul>

<li><b>Perl</b> &mdash; Have your LSP install Perl. The standard port
of Perl for Windows is called ActivePerl and is available as a free
download from

<blockquote><a href="http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePerl/">http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePerl/</a></blockquote>

To test the installation, open a command window (Start &rarr; Programs
&rarr; Accessories &rarr; Command Prompt) and enter: <tt>perl
-v</tt></li>


<li><b>Java</b> &mdash; Have your LSP install the Java Runtime
Environment, available as a free download from

<blockquote><a href="http://java.com/">http://java.com/</a></blockquote>

(Just click the <b>Get It Now</b> button.) To test the installation,
open a command window (Start &rarr; Programs &rarr; Accessories &rarr;
Command Prompt) and enter: <tt>java -version</tt><br><br></li>


<li><b>NoteTab</b> &mdash; Normally the free text editor NoteTab Light
will already be installed on your PC, but if you have a version older
than 4.8, have your LSP upgrade to the current version. NoteTab Light
is available either from ITC's Software Central or from the NoteTab
web site:

<blockquote><a href="http://www.itc.virginia.edu/desktop/central/">http://www.itc.virginia.edu/desktop/central/</a> <br>
<a href="http://www.notetab.com/">http://www.notetab.com/</a></blockquote></li>

<li><b>NoteTab setup</b>

  <ul>

  <li>If you don't already have a folder named <tt>C:\temp</tt> on
  your computer, create it. (This folder is needed for temporary files
  and error logs.)</li>

  <li>Make sure you have write permission on folder <tt>C:\temp</tt>
  and on whatever folder you use for the output file.</li>

  <li>Download the file <a href="DLPS.clb">DLPS.clb</a> (right-click
  and choose <b>Save Target As...</b>, then for file type, select "All
  files") and save it to <tt>C:\Program Files\NoteTab Light\Libraries</tt></li>

  <li>Close NoteTab if it's open. Open NoteTab, open the Clipbook
  (Tools &rarr; Clipbook &rarr; Open Clipbook), and choose <b>DLPS</b>
  from the pull-down menu in the Clipbook.</li>

  <li>Double-click <b>About these commands...</b> to view a dialog box
  with a description of each command in the <b>DLPS</b> clip library.</li>

  <li>Map the DLPS workspace <tt>\\pogo.lib.virginia.edu\text</tt> as
  a network drive, using any available drive letter.</li>

  <li>Double-click <b>Indicate drive letter for DLPS workspace...</b>
  in the Clipbook. In the dialog box that appears, enter the drive
  letter used to map the DLPS workspace as a network drive.</li>

  </ul>
