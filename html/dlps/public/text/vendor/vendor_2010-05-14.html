<h2><a name="I"></a>I. Introduction</h2>

<h3><a name="dtd"></a>The DTD</h3>

<p>The University of Virginia Library (U.Va. Library) uses a customization of
TEI version P4.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> This document only describes encoding practices
specific to U.Va. Library. It is not a tutorial on TEI encoding.</p>

<div class="revised">

<p><b>Obtaining the DTD:</b> We recommend using URLs for validating
XML documents produced for us, but if you prefer to use local copies
of our DTD-related files rather than URLs, download copies of the
files as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Download current version of U.Va. Library modification files (one .ent file and one .dtd file):
  <ul>
  <li><a href="http://text.lib.virginia.edu/dtd/tei/uva-dl-tei/uva-dl-tei.ent">uva-dl-tei.ent</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://text.lib.virginia.edu/dtd/tei/uva-dl-tei/uva-dl-tei.dtd">uva-dl-tei.dtd</a></li>
  </ul>
</li>

<li>Download TEI P4 files: 
<a href="tei-p4.zip">tei-p4.zip</a></li>

<li>Download our character entity sets:
<a href="uva-charent.zip">uva-charent.zip</a></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p><b>Invoking the DTD:</b> The main DTD driver file is
<b>tei2.dtd</b>. The required U.Va.-specific modification files are
<b>uva-dl-tei.ent</b> and <b>uva-dl-tei.dtd</b>. Together they
constitute a customization of TEI P4. To invoke the DTD, refer to the
main DTD driver file in the DOCTYPE declaration, and include ENTITY
declarations for the modification files in the internal subset:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE TEI.2 SYSTEM "http://text.lib.virginia.edu/dtd/tei/tei-p4/tei2.dtd" [
&lt;!ENTITY % TEI.extensions.ent SYSTEM "http://text.lib.virginia.edu/dtd/tei/uva-dl-tei/uva-dl-tei.ent">
&lt;!ENTITY % TEI.extensions.dtd SYSTEM "http://text.lib.virginia.edu/dtd/tei/uva-dl-tei/uva-dl-tei.dtd">
]>
</pre></blockquote>

or, if you are using local copies of our DTD-related files:

<blockquote><pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE TEI.2 SYSTEM "tei-p4/tei2.dtd" [
&lt;!ENTITY % TEI.extensions.ent SYSTEM "uva-dl-tei/uva-dl-tei.ent">
&lt;!ENTITY % TEI.extensions.dtd SYSTEM "uva-dl-tei/uva-dl-tei.dtd">
]>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>As the preceding example declaration shows, the U.Va. Library
modification files and the TEI P4 files (which are unmodified; they
remain exactly as originally downloaded from www.tei-c.org) can reside
in different directories .</p>

</div>

<p><b>uva-dl-tei vs. TEI Lite</b>: Encoders familiar with 
<a href="http://www.tei-c.org/Lite/">TEI Lite</a> (or with unmodified
<a href="http://www.tei-c.org/P4X/">TEI P4</a>) will notice that our
DTD (uva-dl-tei) is generally more rigorous or strict than TEI
Lite. For example:</p>

<ul>

<li>The content models for essential structural elements (text, group,
front, body, and back) are significantly simplified.<br /><br /></li>

<li>All content must be encoded within a &lt;div1> or lower-level
division. No content is allowed directly within &lt;front>, &lt;body>,
or &lt;back>. The &lt;div> and &lt;div0> elements are not
used.<br /><br /></li>

<li>uva-dl-tei disallows most of the logical elements normally used to
encode the semantic meaning of highlighted words and phrases (such as
emph, distinct, soCalled, term, mentioned). Instead, changes in
typeface must be encoded with the appropriate physical element (using
convenience elements &lt;i> for italic, &lt;b> for bold, etc.). The
exception to this practice is foreign words or phrases, which should
be encoded using the usual &lt;foreign> element.<br /><br /></li>

<li>Many elements in uva-dl-tei have required attributes, where
in TEI Lite the same attributes are optional (for example, the type
attribute on &lt;div#> elements).<br /><br /></li>

<li>Many attributes in uva-dl-tei have enumerated vocabularies
of allowed values, where in TEI Lite the same attributes can take any
value (again, the type attribute on &lt;div#> elements is a good
example).<br /><br /></li>

<li>In TEI Lite, the global <b>rend</b> attribute can contain any
value. In uva-dl-tei, the global rend attribute is limited to
indicating display ("block" or "inline"), alignment ("center", "left",
or "right"), and indentation ("indent", "indent2" etc., or "hang")
&mdash; not typographic changes. For example, where TEI Lite allows
&lt;p rend="italic">...&lt;/p> (or rend="italics" or rend="ital" or
rend="i"), uva-dl-tei requires
&lt;p>&lt;i>...&lt;/i>&lt;/p>.<br /><br /></li>

<li>For elements that require additional values for the <b>rend</b>
attribute, such as &lt;hi>, the possible values are still limited to
an enumerated list. If none of the allowed values is applicable, use
the value "other" and use the <b>other</b> attribute to supply the
needed value, as in &lt;hi rend="other" other="...">.</li>

</ul>

<p>uva-dl-tei also adds several convenience elements not available in
TEI Lite:</p>

<ul>

<li>&lt;i>, &lt;b>, etc. for italics, bold, and other typographic
changes</li>

<li>&lt;cb> for column breaks, and &lt;cols> for marking abrupt
changes in columnar layout</li>

<li>&lt;quotedLetter> for block quotations requiring an &lt;opener>
and/or &lt;closer></li>

<li>&lt;ps> for postscripts in letters</li>

</ul>


<hr class="subsection" />
<h3><a name="general"></a>General Guidelines</h3>

<p><b>XML:</b> All documents should be encoded in the XML expression
of TEI (not SGML).</p>

<p><b>The transcription:</b> The electronic text should contain an exact
character-for-character transcription of the text of the print
source.</p>

<p><b>Including all content:</b> With very few exceptions (see <a
href="#exceptions">Exceptions</a> immediately below), <em>all</em>
content from the print source must be included in the electronic
text. All textual data must be included in the transcription, and all
non-textual data must be included in the markup as <a
href="#figure">figures</a>.</p>

<p><a name="exceptions"></a><b>Exceptions:</b> The only exceptions to
the "include all content" rule are:</p>

<ul>

<li><b>Running page headers:</b> Exclude the running headers that
often appear at the top of each page in a printed book. (These headers
are typically very repetitive and only contain content already
available elsewhere in the electronic transcription, such as the title
of the book or the title of the current chapter.)

<blockquote><p><b>Note:</b> In rare cases, running page headers will
contain unique content (such as a summary of the content of the
current page). In such cases U.Va. Library will require that the running
headers be included in the electronic text. See <a href="#pb">Page
Breaks</a> for information on encoding running headers.</p></blockquote>

</li>

<li><b>Gaps:</b> Gaps in the transcription are necessary in some
cases, typically either because a passage is missing from the print
source (due to a missing or torn page, for example), or because the
print source contains non-Western characters. Any such omissions in
the transcription must be indicated by the &lt;gap/> element. See
<a href="#gapunclear">Gaps and Uncertainties</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="notesdoc"></a><b>Providing notes:</b> While transcribing
and encoding even the most typical, straightforward materials, some
problems or uncertainties are likely to arise. Any unusual
circumstances encountered in the transcription or encoding process
should be noted in a document that gets delivered to U.Va. Library along with
the encoded XML files themselves. We prefer to receive one such
"Notes" document for each electronic text (rather than one document
for an entire encoding project). The document should include
information on these kinds of situations:</p>

<ul>
<li>oddities, errors, or unusual features in the print source, and how
they have been handled in the electronic text</li>

<li>non-obvious markup decisions, such as decisions on how to encode
ambiguous or problematic parts of the printed text</li>
</ul>



<hr />
<h2><a name="II"></a>II. Major Structure</h2>

<h3><a name="structure"></a>Essential Structure</h3>

<p>Follow the essential structural markup common to most TEI
documents:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
&lt;TEI.2>
    &lt;teiHeader>
        . . . [metadata section supplied by U.Va. Library to the keyboarding vendor]
    &lt;/teiHeader>
    &lt;text>
        &lt;front>
            . . . [front matter: title page, acknowledgments, dedication, table of contents, preface, etc.]
        &lt;/front>
        &lt;body>
            . . . [main body of text]
        &lt;/body>
        &lt;back>
            . . . [back matter: endnotes, index, appendices, etc.]
        &lt;/back>
    &lt;/text>
&lt;/TEI.2>
</pre></blockquote>

<p><b>TEI header:</b> The &lt;teiHeader> element will be supplied by
U.Va. Library to the keyboarding vendor.</p>

<p><b>Composite texts:</b> In rare cases, U.Va. Library will request that a
particular document be marked as a composite text, in which the usual
&lt;body> element is replaced with the &lt;group> element, which then
contains multiple &lt;text> elements, each with its own &lt;front>,
&lt;body>, and &lt;back>. (This can occur with anthologies or
collected works, where each work has its own front and/or back
matter.)</p>

<blockquote><pre>
&lt;TEI.2>
    &lt;teiHeader>
        . . . [metadata section supplied by U.Va. Library to the keyboarding vendor]
    &lt;/teiHeader>
    &lt;text>
        &lt;front> . . . [front matter for the collection] &lt;/front>
        &lt;group>
            &lt;text>
                &lt;front> . . . [front matter of first text] &lt;/front>
                &lt;body> . . . [main body of first text] &lt;/body>
                &lt;back> . . . [back matter of first text] &lt;/back>
            &lt;/text>
            &lt;text>
                &lt;front> . . . [front matter of second text] &lt;/front>
                &lt;body> . . . [main body of second text] &lt;/body>
                &lt;back> . . . [back matter of second text] &lt;/back>
            &lt;/text>
        &lt;/group>
        &lt;back> . . . [back matter for the collection] &lt;/back>
    &lt;/text>
&lt;/TEI.2>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>This kind of structure should be used <em>only</em> when
specifically requested by U.Va. Library for a particular document.</p>


<hr class="subsection" />
<h3><a name="div"></a>Structural Divisions</h3>

<p><b>Starting with &lt;div1>:</b> Although TEI Lite allows them, we
do not use the &lt;div> or &lt;div0> elements. Instead, top-level
structural divisions must be encoded as &lt;div1>.</p>

<p><b>All content within a div:</b> The &lt;front>, &lt;body>, and
&lt;back> elements must contain only &lt;div1> elements. That is, all
content must be enclosed by a &lt;div1> or lower-level division, not
placed directly within the &lt;front>, &lt;body>, or &lt;back>
elements. This holds true even for <a href="#pb">page breaks</a>.</p>

<p><b>Determining division boundaries:</b> When determining the start-
and end-points of divisions and the nesting of lower-level divisions,
refer to the printed table of contents for the work. Typically the
table of contents is an accurate guide to the hierarchical structure
of the work.</p>

<p><b>type attribute:</b> Each &lt;div#> tag must have a <b>type</b>
attribute indicating the kind of division. If the division has no
obvious type, the generic term "section" may be used; if "section" has
already been used for a higher-level division, use "subsection".
Typical <b>type</b> values for divisions within &lt;body> are:</p>

<ul>
<li>act</li>
<li>article</li>
<li>book</li>
<li>chapter</li>
<li>editorial &mdash; for opinion pieces in newspapers</li>
<li>entry &mdash; for journal entries or encyclopedia/dictionary entries</li>
<li>essay</li>
<li>letter</li>
<li>part</li>

<li>plates &mdash; one or more full-page illustrations, often
unnumbered or numbered independently of main pagination</li>

<li>poem</li>
<li>scene</li>
<li>section</li>

<li>speech &mdash; for a transcript of an oration, not for a piece of
dialog in a dramatic work (for which use &lt;sp>)</li>

<li>story</li>
<li>subsection</li>
<li>volume</li>
<li>work</li>
</ul>

<p>Some <b>type</b> values are appropriate within &lt;body> or
&lt;front>, depending on context:</p>

<ul>
<li>abstract</li>
<li>prologue</li>
</ul>

<p>Others are appropriate within &lt;body> or &lt;back>, depending on
context:</p>

<ul>
<li>epilogue</li>
<li>notes</li>
<li>summary</li>
</ul>

<p><b>n attribute:</b> If the division is numbered
or otherwise labeled in the print source, record the number or label
in the n attribute. Typically the number associated with a division is
obvious from the division's header. If the division does not have a
number associated with it, do not include the n attribute.</p>

<p><a href="examples/divn.html">[example of a
straightforward div structure]</a></p>

<p><b>Division headings:</b> A division will usually (though not
always) have a heading that announces it. The heading should, of
course, be marked with &lt;head>.</p>

<p>It is fairly common for a division to have more than one
heading. In such cases, use multiple &lt;head> elements, and include
the <b>type</b> attribute to distinguish the headings and identify
their roles. Use the same <b>type</b> values used for the <a
href="#titlePart_type">&lt;titlePart></a> element, namely "main",
"sub", "desc" (for descriptive), and "alt" (for alternative).</p>

<p>When a division has only one &lt;head>, it is necessarily the main
one, so the <b>type</b> attribute is unnecessary and should not be
used.</p>

<p><a href="examples/head.html">[example]</a></p>


<p><b>Half-titles, fly-titles, and divisional titles:</b> A common
feature in many books is a separate page containing the title of the
work (or the title of a section of the work). There are three main
types of such features:</p>

<ul>
<li>A page preceding the title page and bearing the title of the work,
perhaps with a series title or volume number, is a "half-title" and
should be marked as &lt;div1 type="half-title"> within
&lt;front>.</li>

<li>A page similar to a half-title page but occuring between the front
matter and the body is a "fly-title" and should be marked as &lt;div1
type="fly-title"> as the last division within &lt;front> (not as the
first division of the &lt;body>).</li>

<li>A page, or just an initial heading preceding other headings,
similar to a half-title but occuring <em>within the body</em> of the
work, to announce the beginning of a major section, is a "divisional
title". In contrast to half-title and fly-title pages within the front
matter, a divisional title should <em>not</em> be marked with its own
&lt;div#>. Instead, the divisional title should be incorporated
<em>into</em> the &lt;div#> that it precedes, as a &lt;head>
element.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="examples/fly-title.html">[example
showing a fly-title and a divisional title]</a></p>


<p><a name="informal_divs"></a>
<b>Informal divisions:</b> It is fairly common (especially in
poems, but also in prose works) to see informal divisions, indicated
by a string of asterisks or periods, or by a horizontal
line. Normally, such features do <em>not</em> indicate the beginning
of a new &lt;div#>. Instead, mark them as &lt;ornament/> elements.</p>

<p>For strings of asterisks, periods, etc., set the <b>type</b>
attribute to "characters", and include the characters as the content
of the &lt;ornament> element. For example:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
&lt;ornament type="characters">*&amp;emsp;*&amp;emsp;*&amp;emsp;*&amp;emsp;*&amp;emsp;*&amp;emsp;*&amp;emsp;*&lt;/ornament>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>For horizontal lines, set <b>type</b> to "line" and leave the
content of the element empty:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
&lt;ornament type="line"/>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>The same approach should be used for <a href="#ornaments">printer's
ornaments</a>.</p>

<p><b>Quotations of verse within prose:</b> In cases where a brief
section of <a href="#verse">verse</a> is quoted within a predominantly
prose text, the verse should be marked as a <a href="#q">block
quotation</a> (&lt;q>), <em>not</em> as a distinct &lt;div#>.</p>


<hr class="subsection" />
<h3><a name="front"></a>Front and Back Matter</h3>

<p>Use &lt;div1> to mark the main sections of the front matter and
back matter. The exception to this rule is the main title page of the
work, for which the &lt;titlePage> element is used. Use the
<b>type</b> attribute on the &lt;div1> element to indicate the type of
division. Typical values for front matter include:</p>

<ul>
<li>acknowledgements</li>
<li>advertisement</li>
<li>book-plate</li>
<li>castlist &mdash; for list of characters preceding a dramatic work</li>
<li>chronology &mdash; for biographical or historical timelines</li>
<li>contents &mdash; for tables of contents <em>and</em> for lists of illustrations, etc.</li>
<li>dedication</li>
<li>errata &mdash; for lists of printing errors; also called corrigenda</li>

<li>fly-title &mdash; like a half-title page, but occurs between the
front matter and the body; treat as last page of front matter (not
first page of body)</li>

<li>foreword</li>

<li>frontispiece &mdash; technically, an illustration facing the title
page; may also be used for any full-page illustration in the front
matter, or for an illustration facing the first page of a major
division within the body</li>

<li>half-title &mdash; a page preceding the title page bearing the
title of the work, perhaps with a series title or volume number</li>

<li>introduction</li>

<li>masthead &mdash; a block of matter in a newspaper or other
periodical indicating title of publication, address, list of editors
or other contributors, etc.</li>

<li>preface</li>
</ul>

<p>Typical <b>type</b> values for back matter include:</p>

<ul>
<li>advertisement</li>
<li>appendix</li>
<li>bibliography</li>
<li>bio &mdash; for brief biographic sketches of authors or other contributors</li>

<li>colophon &mdash; a section at or near the end of a book,
containing printing information such as name of printer (as distinct
from publisher), typefaces used, etc.</li>

<li>glossary</li>
<li>index</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="revised"><a name="spine"></a>Images for Book Spine, Covers, and Edges</h4>

<p class="revised">Normally, the page images delivered to the
keyboarding vendor by UVa Library will include images of the spine,
front cover, back cover, top edge, bottom edge, and front edge. Each
of these images should be marked as a &lt;pb/> element immediately
following the opening &lt;front> tag. For example:</p>

<blockquote class="revised"><pre>
&lt;front>
&lt;pb n="Spine"/>
&lt;pb n="Front Cover"/>
&lt;pb n="Back Cover"/>
&lt;pb n="Top Edge"/>
&lt;pb n="Bottom Edge"/>
&lt;pb n="Front Edge"/>
</pre></blockquote>

<h4>Title Page</h4>

<p>Within &lt;front>, the title page is, of course, marked up using
the &lt;titlePage> element rather than &lt;div1>.</p>

<p><a name="titlePart_type"></a>
<b>Title types:</b> When using the &lt;titlePart> element to mark
the parts of the title, include the <b>type</b> attribute, assigning
one of these values:</p>

<ul>
<li>main &mdash; main title of the work</li>
<li>sub &mdash; subtitle</li>
<li>desc &mdash; descriptive title</li>
<li>alt &mdash; alternative title</li>
<li>volume &mdash; volume information</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Include verso:</b> The content on the verso (reverse side) of
the title page should be included within the &lt;titlePage>
element.</p>

<p><b>Volume information:</b> The volume information should go in a
&lt;titlePart type="volume">. This is true even if the volume
information is separated from the title by the byline or other
elements (&lt;titlePart> is allowed outside &lt;docTitle>).</p>

<blockquote><pre>
. . . &lt;/docTitle>
&lt;byline>By &lt;docAuthor>BOOKER T. WASHINGTON&lt;/docAuthor>&lt;/byline>
&lt;titlePart type="volume">VOLUME I&lt;/titlePart>
</pre></blockquote>

<hr />
<h2><a name="III"></a>III. Genres</h2>

<h3><a name="letters"></a>Letters</h3>

<p>When encoding letters, prefaces, and other such personal writings,
use the appropriate elements for the opening and closing sections:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>opener</b> &mdash; groups together dateline, salutation,
etc. at the beginning of a letter or other division</li>

<li><b>closer</b> &mdash; groups together salutation, signature,
etc. at the end of a letter or other division</li>
</ul>

<p>Openers and closers, in turn, contain one or more of these
elements:</p>

<ul>

<li><b>dateline</b> &mdash; contains a brief description of the place,
date, time, etc., the letter, preface, etc. was written</li>

<li><b>date</b> &mdash; contains a date in any format. Use the
<b>value</b> attribute to provide the date in standard yyyy-mm-dd
format. If part of the date is unknown, omit that part.

<blockquote><pre>
&lt;date value="1901-08-04">4 Aug., 1901&lt;/date>
&lt;date value="1870-03">March 1870&lt;/date>
</pre></blockquote>

</li>

<li><b>name</b> &mdash; contains a proper name; use the <b>type</b>
attribute to indicate "person" or "place".</li>

<li><b>salute</b> &mdash; salutation at the beginning (e.g. "Dear
Sir") or end (e.g. "Yours sincerely") of a letter</li>

<li><b>signed</b> &mdash; signature at the end of a letter, preface,
etc.</li>

<li><b>ps</b> &mdash; postscripts</li>

<p><b>Line groups:</b> All verse &mdash; including poems without
distinct stanzas, as well as verse quoted within a block of prose
&mdash; should be encoded with the &lt;lg> element. The <b>type</b>
attribute is required; if the lines of verse have no obvious grouping
(such as "stanza"), use type="group".</p>

<p><b>Indentation:</b> If a line of verse is indented more than the
surrounding lines, use &lt;l rend="indent">...&lt;/l>.
<a href="examples/verse.html">[example]</a></p>

<p><b>Line breaks:</b> When encoding verse it is important to
distinguish between logical lines of verse and the physical
presentation of those lines on the printed page. In cases where a line
of verse is too long to fit on the printed page, and for that reason
is continued on a second line, use &lt;l> to mark the logical line of
verse and &lt;lb/> to mark the physical line break.
<a href="examples/verse_lb.html">[example]</a></p>

<h3><a name="drama"></a>Drama</h3>

<p>Use the standard TEI elements for encoding dramatic works:</p>

<ul>
<li>act and scene divisions should be marked with &lt;div#> elements</li>
<li>speeches should be marked with &lt;sp> elements, with speakers marked as &lt;speaker></li>
<li>stage directions should be marked with &lt;stage></li>
<li>castlists should be marked as &lt;div# type="castlist"></li>
</ul>


<hr class="subsection" />
<h3><a name="newspapers"></a>Newspapers</h3>

<p><a href="examples/newspaper.html">[Newspaper markup example]</a></p>

<p><b>Files and file naming:</b> Each issue (each day) of the
newspaper should be encoded as a single <tt>&lt;TEI.2></tt> document
contained in a single XML file. For the Cavalier Daily project, each
file should be named "CavDaily_yyyymmdd.xml". For example, the issue
for March 11, 1969 would be named:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
CavDaily_19690311.xml
</pre></blockquote>

<p>In cases where the vendor creates page images from microfilm, the
page images should be named with the same base filename as the issue
to which the page images pertain, followed by a two-digit page
sequence number. For example:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
CavDaily_19690311_01.tif
CavDaily_19690311_02.tif
CavDaily_19690311_03.tif
CavDaily_19690311_04.tif
</pre></blockquote>

<p><b>ENTITY declaration:</b> When declaring the DTD, include an
ENTITY declaration named NEWSPAPER with value "INCLUDE". This enables
the newspaper-specific features of the DTD, which are disabled by
default.</p>

<blockquote><pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE TEI.2 SYSTEM "tei-p4/tei2.dtd" [
&lt;!ENTITY % TEI.extensions.ent SYSTEM "uva-dl-tei/uva-dl-tei.ent">
&lt;!ENTITY % TEI.extensions.dtd SYSTEM "uva-dl-tei/uva-dl-tei.dtd">
&lt;!ENTITY % NEWSPAPER "INCLUDE">
</pre></blockquote>

<p><b>TEI header:</b> For the Cavalier Daily project, use the
following TEI header template. This template can be inserted into the
TEI file without any modifications or enhancements:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
&lt;teiHeader>
&lt;fileDesc>
&lt;titleStmt>
&lt;title>The Cavalier Daily&lt;/title>
&lt;/titleStmt>
&lt;publicationStmt>
&lt;publisher>University of Virginia Library&lt;/publisher>
&lt;/publicationStmt>
&lt;sourceDesc>&lt;bibl/>&lt;/sourceDesc>
&lt;/fileDesc>
&lt;profileDesc>
&lt;langUsage>
&lt;language id="eng">English&lt;/language>
&lt;/langUsage>
&lt;/profileDesc>
&lt;/teiHeader>
</pre></blockquote>

<p><b>Page layout:</b> The columnar layout of a newspaper page is
typically very complex, with multiple levels of column breaks. The
<em>column</em> breaks should <em>not</em> be recorded. Instead, all
<em>page</em> breaks must be recorded, and the articles and other
content on that page should be transcribed in the order in which they
appear on the page, moving primarily from top to bottom and
secondarily from left to right.</p>

<p>In other words, transcribe all the pieces along the top of the page
first, moving left to right; then the pieces in the various
mid-sections (there will usually be more than one level) of the page,
moving left to right; and finally the pieces along the bottom of the
page, moving left to right.</p>

<p><a href="examples/newspaper_layout.html">[Example of page layout sequence]</a></p>

<p><b>Associating related sections:</b> Because newspaper articles are
often broken up and printed in two (or more) sections on
different pages, it is necessary to associate the first section
of the article with the subsequent section(s). Use the <b>id</b>,
<b>next</b> and <b>prev</b> attributes on &lt;div#> to achieve
this.</p>

<blockquote><pre>
&lt; -- start tag for first part of article -->
&lt;div1 type="article" id="a1.2" next="a3.1">

&lt; -- start tag for second part of article -->
&lt;div1 type="article" id="a3.1" prev="a1.2">
</pre></blockquote>

<p>When assigning identifiers for the <b>id</b> attribute, use this
scheme:</p>

<ul>
<li>Begin the ID with "a" (for "article")</li>
<li>Provide the page number, followed by a dot</li>
<li>Assign a sequence number to the article indicating whether it is
the first article to be encoded for that page, the second article, the
third, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, the first article (or partial article) on the first
page should be assigned <tt>id="a1.1"</tt>. On the third page, the
fourth article (or partical article) to be encoded for that page
(moving from left to right and from top to bottom, as instructed
above) should be assigned <tt>id="a3.4"</tt>. Please assign an ID to
all &lt;div1 type="article"> elements, even if the article is not
split into two non-contiguous sections. (Other division types do not
require an ID.)</p>

<p>When an article is broken into two or more sections on different
pages, each section of the article must be enclosed in its own
&lt;div1&gt; element. This is necessary because other articles or
partial articles will occur between the two sections.</p>

<p>The "jump" line -- the phrase indicating where to look for the
continuation of the article -- should be encoded in a
<tt>&lt;ref></tt> element, with a <tt>target</tt> attribute containing
the ID of the <tt>div1</tt> containing the article continuation.</p>

<blockquote><pre>
&lt;ab type="ref">&lt;ref target="a3.1">(see Players, p. 3)&lt;/ref>&lt;/ab>
&lt;/div1>
&lt;!-- Intervening content... -->
&lt;div1 type="article" id="a3.1" prev="a1.2">
&lt;pb n="3"/>
&lt;head type="main">Players Present Grievances Tonight&lt;/head>
&lt;ab type="ref" rend="center">&lt;ref target="a1.2">(continued from p.1)&lt;/ref>&lt;/ab>
</pre></blockquote>

<p><b>Photographs:</b> When encoding photographs, illustrations, or
other graphic elements using &lt;figure>, the &lt;figure> should be
placed in its own &lt;div1> if the photograph is not contained within
a particular article. (See example markup, photo on page 1 with
caption "Bill Gibson Encourages His Players...".) If the photograph
appears within the text of a particular article (usually contained
within a single column of text), then the &lt;figure> should be
encoded directly within the &lt;div#> in which it occurs. (See markup
example, photo on page 3 with caption "Coach Bill Gibson".)</p>

<p>The credit or byline accompanying a photograph or other graphic
should be encoded with a &lt;byline> element within &lt;figure>, for
example:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
&lt;figure>
&lt;byline>Joe Smith&lt;/byline>
&lt;head>THE ROTUNDA AT DAWN&lt;/head>
&lt;p>Students converse on steps as sun rises.&lt;/p>
&lt;/figure>
</pre></blockquote>


<p><b>Division types:</b> When encoding newspapers, the most common
kind of major structural division will be "article" (not "story",
which is intended for encoding prose fiction short stories).</p>

<blockquote><pre>
&lt;div1 type="article">
</pre></blockquote>

<p>A brief section (typically only one or two paragraphs) enclosed in
a box and placed at the end of a column of text is called a "filler"
and should be marked as &lt;div1&nbsp;type="filler">. (See newspaper markup
example for two examples of this.)</p>

<p>The main heading on the top of the first page, showing the name of
the newspaper, is called a "nameplate" and should be marked as
&lt;div1&nbsp;type="nameplate">. The details of publication should be
marked as follows:</p>

<table cellpadding="4" border="1">
<tr>
<td>volume number (sometimes expressed as a year, as in "79th Year")</td>
<td>&lt;num type="volume" value="...">...&lt;/num></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>place of publication</td>
<td>&lt;name type="place">...&lt;/name></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>date of publication</td>
<td>&lt;date value="yyyy-mm-dd">...&lt;/date></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>issue number</td>
<td>&lt;num type="number" value="...">...&lt;/num></td>
</tr>
</table>

<blockquote><pre>
&lt;text>
&lt;body>
&lt;div1 type="nameplate">
&lt;pb/>
&lt;head>THE CAVALIER DAILY&lt;/head>
&lt;ab>&lt;num type="volume" value="79">79th YEAR&lt;/num> 
&lt;name type="place">UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA, CHARLOTTESVILLE&lt;/name>, 
&lt;date value="1969-03-11">TUESDAY, MARCH 11, 1969&lt;/date> 
&lt;num type="number" value="92">NUMBER 92&lt;/num>&lt;/ab>
&lt;/div1>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>The blocks of content appearing on the editorial page of the
newspaper &mdash; which is almost always the second page of the
newspaper &mdash; require special division types:</p>

<ul>

<li>The listing of newspaper staff should be marked as &lt;div1
type="masthead">.

<blockquote><p>For the Cavalier Daily project, the masthead is often
divided into two parts, although both appear on the same page (page
2). In these cases, both parts should be marked as <code>div1
type="masthead"</code>, but they should also have an <code>id</code>
attribute and use the <code>next</code> and <code>prev</code>
attributes to indicate that they are related:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
&lt;div1 type="masthead" id="m1" next="m2">
...
&lt;/div1>
.
.
.
&lt;div1 type="masthead" id="m2" prev="m1">
...
&lt;/div1>
</pre></blockquote>
</blockquote>
</li>

<li>The section with the heading "Letters to the Editor" should be
marked as &lt;div 1 type="op-ed">, while each individual letter should
be marked &lt;div2 type="letter">.

<blockquote><pre>
&lt;div1 type="op-ed">
&lt;head>Letters To The Editor&lt;/head>
&lt;div2 type="letter">
&lt;opener>
&lt;salute>Dear Sir:&lt;/salute>
&lt;/opener>
...
&lt;/div2>
&lt;-- more &lt;div2 type="letter"> divisions here... --&gt;
&lt;/div1>
</pre></blockquote>
</li>

<li>Other pieces on the editorial page should be marked as &lt;div1 type="op-ed">
("op-ed" is short for opinion/editorial).</li>
</ul>

<p>For the Cavalier Daily project, most issues will have a "University
Notices" section and a classified advertisements section. These
sections are handled similarly. The "University Notices" typically
appear first and should be marked as &lt;div1
type="univ-notices">. Each category, such as "TODAY" or
"MISCELLANEOUS" should be marked as &lt;div2 type="section">, and then
each individual notice should be marked with &lt;p>. For example:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
&lt;div1 type="univ-notices">
&lt;head>&lt;i>University Notices&lt;/i>&lt;/head>
&lt;div2 type="section">
&lt;head>TODAY&lt;/head>
&lt;p>FELLOWSHIP of Christian Ath- &lt;lb/>
letes meeting at 7:30 p.m., Wesley &lt;lb/>
Foundation.&lt;/p>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Similary, the classifieds section should be marked as &lt;div1
type="classifieds">. Each category, such as "FOR SALE" or "WANTED",
should be marked as &lt;div2 type="section">, and then each individual
classified ad should be marked as &lt;p>. For example:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
&lt;div1 type="classifieds">
&lt;head>CLASSIFIEDS&lt;/head>
&lt;div2 type="section">
&lt;head>FOR RENT&lt;/head>
&lt;p>Apartment for rent...&lt;/p>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>If, but only if, none of the division types described above is
appropriate to a particular block of content, use the generic type
"section" (or, if "section" has already been used for a higher-level
division, use "subsection").</p>

<p><b>Special kinds of gaps:</b> When encoding newspapers, some kinds
of content should be excluded from the electronic transcription (due
to copyright restrictions or other editorial reasons not pertaining to
physical damage to the print source). Rather than using &lt;gap
desc="..."  reason="editorial"/> for these gaps, use the special
convenience elements provided by the DTD:</p>

<table cellpadding="4">
<tr>
<td><b>&lt;ad/></b></td>
<td>for advertisements</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><b>&lt;cartoon/></b></td>
<td>for cartoons appearing in a single frame or box</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><b>&lt;comicStrip/></b></td>
<td>for cartoons appearing in multiple frames or boxes</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><b>&lt;puzzle/></b></td>
<td>for crossword or other puzzles</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><b>&lt;wireArticle/></b></td>
<td>for articles with a wire-service credit</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><b>&lt;wirePhoto/></b></td>
<td>for photographs with a wire-service credit</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Wire-service articles and photographs are identified by one of the
following phrases in the byline or dateline:</p>

<ul>
<li>AP</li>
<li>Associated Press</li>
<li>UPI</li>
<li>United Press International</li>
<li>UP</li>
<li>United Press</li>
</ul>

<p>Such phrases are usually enclosed in parentheses. The following
article dateline is typical:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
WASHINGTON (UPI)
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Wire-service articles are a special case. Instead of replacing the
entire article with a &lt;wireArticle/> element (in the spot where a
&lt;div1 type="article"> element would go if it were not a
wire-service article), we want to capture the headline, but not the
article content. For example:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
&lt;div1 type="article" id="a1.4">
&lt;head>Finch Warns Cut-Off &lt;lb/>
Of Grants to Rioters&lt;/head>
&lt;wireArticle/>
&lt;p/>
&lt;/div1>
</pre></blockquote>

<h3><a name="articles"></a>Journal Articles</h3>

<p>[No special encoding requirements for journal articles at this
time.]</p>


<hr class="subsection" />
<h3><a name="encyc_dict"></a>Encyclopedias and Dictionaries</h3>

<h4>Encyclopedias</h4>

<p>Encyclopedia entries typically consist mainly of prose paragraphs
and do not normally pose any special markup issues. Each encyclopedia
entry is a &lt;div#> containing one or more headings followed by
paragraphs.</p>

<h4>Dictionaries</h4>

<p>Dictionary entries should be encoded using the TEI additional
tagset for print dictionaries. For detailed information on the use of
these elements, see <a href="http://www.tei-c.org/P4X/DI.html">Chapter
12, Print Dictionaries</a> in the TEI Guidelines.</p>

<p>To enable the dictionary-specific features of the DTD, declare an
entity named DICTIONARY with value "INCLUDE", like this:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE TEI.2 SYSTEM "tei-p4/tei2.dtd" [
&lt;!ENTITY % TEI.extensions.ent SYSTEM "uva-dl-tei/uva-dl-tei.ent">
&lt;!ENTITY % TEI.extensions.dtd SYSTEM "uva-dl-tei/uva-dl-tei.dtd">
&lt;!ENTITY % DICTIONARY "INCLUDE">
</pre></blockquote>

<p>In the simplest case, a dictionary entry has minimal grammatical
information and only one definition:</p>

<blockquote><p><b>After-night,</b> <i>n.</i> &nbsp; The time after
it becomes night.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><pre>
&lt;entry>
&lt;form>&lt;orth>&lt;b>After-night,&lt;/b>&lt;/orth>&lt;/form>
&lt;gramGrp>&lt;pos>&lt;i>n.&lt;/i>&lt;/pos>&lt;/gramGrp>
&lt;def>The time after it becomes night.&lt;/def>
&lt;/entry>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>An entry may include alternative spellings for the main word, in
which case the alternative spellings should be marked with
&lt;orth&nbsp;type="alt">:</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Again,</b> <i>conj. &nbsp; Agen; agin:</i> By the time
that, untill: "I'll have<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; it ready
<i>agin</i> you come."</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><pre>
&lt;entry rend="hang">
&lt;form>&lt;orth>&lt;b>Again,&lt;/b>&lt;/orth>&lt;/form>
&lt;gramGrp>&lt;pos>&lt;i>conj.&lt;/i>&lt;/pos>&lt;/gramGrp>
&lt;form>&lt;orth type="alt">&lt;i>Agen; agin:&lt;/i>&lt;/orth>&lt;/form>
&lt;def>By the time that, untill:&lt;/def>
&lt;eg>&lt;q rend="inline">"I'll have &lt;lb/>
it ready &lt;i>agin&lt;/i> you come."&lt;/q>&lt;/eg>
&lt;/entry>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>The preceding example also includes a usage example, marked with
&lt;eg>. The &lt;eg> element does not allow character data; instead,
&lt;eg> must contain &lt;q> (for examples with no attributed source)
or &lt;cit> (for examples that include an attribution of the author or
source text).</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Note:</b> Because U.Va. Library normally uses &lt;q> only for
block quotations, when using &lt;q> in a dictionary entry please
indicate &lt;q&nbsp;rend="inline">, as shown above.</p></blockquote>

<p>More complex dictionary entries may include more than one form of
the same word &mdash; that is, multiple homographs (words identical in
spelling but different in meaning or pronunciation), each marked with
&lt;hom>. Entries may also include more than one meaning for the same
word, in which case the information (definitions, examples, etc.) for
each meaning should be grouped as a &lt;sense>. If the senses are
labeled with numbers or letters in the print source, include the label
in the <b>n</b> attribute:</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Against,</b> <i>prep.</i> &nbsp; In resistance to; or defense from "They<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; marched <i>against</i> the Spaniards." (2.) Opposite. "Over<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>against</i> a point called Sandy Point." Against, <i>conj.</i> "Keep<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'em <i>against</i> I come."</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><pre>
&lt;entry rend="hang">
&lt;hom>
&lt;form>&lt;orth>&lt;b>Against,&lt;/b>&lt;/orth>&lt;/form>
&lt;gramGrp>&lt;pos>&lt;i>prep.&lt;/i>&lt;/pos>&lt;/gramGrp>
&lt;sense>
&lt;def>In resistance to; or defense from&lt;/def>
&lt;eg>&lt;q rend="inline">"They &lt;lb/>
marched &lt;i>against&lt;/i> the Spaniards."&lt;/q>&lt;/eg>
&lt;/sense>
&lt;sense n="2">
(2.) &lt;def>Opposite.&lt;/def>
&lt;eg>&lt;q rend="inline">"Over &lt;lb/>
&lt;i>against&lt;/i> a point called Sandy Point."&lt;/q>&lt;/eg>
&lt;/sense>
&lt;/hom>
&lt;hom>
&lt;form>&lt;orth>Against,&lt;/orth>&lt;/form>
&lt;gramGrp>&lt;pos>&lt;i>conj.&lt;/i>&lt;/pos>&lt;/gramGrp>
&lt;eg>&lt;q rend="inline">"Keep &lt;lb/>
'em &lt;i>against&lt;/i> I come."&lt;/q>&lt;/eg>
&lt;/hom>
&lt;/entry>
</pre></blockquote>

<p><a href="examples/dict_entry.html">[page image
for the preceding examples]</a></p>

<p>In cases where words with identical spellings (homographs) receive
separate entries in the dictionary (rather than being included within
a single entry), each entry should be marked as an &lt;entry> as
usual, but then the group of entries should be wrapped in a
&lt;superEntry> element.
<a href="examples/dict_superEntry.html">[example]</a></p>


<hr />
<h2><a name="IV"></a>IV. Block-level Features</h2>

<h3><a name="q"></a>Block Quotations</h3>

<p>The &lt;q> element should be used to mark quotations that are set
off typographically from the surrounding text (not quotations that are
printed in the same typographic style and are indicated only by double
quotation marks), as indicated by one or more of these typographic
changes:</p>

<ul>
<li>set off from the surrounding text by line breaks</li>
<li>indented more than the surrounding text</li>
<li>in a smaller typeface than the surrounding text</li>
</ul>

<p>The &lt;q> element should never be used to replace quotation
marks. If the quotation is both set off from the surrounding text and
enclosed in quotation marks, use the &lt;q> element and also include
the quotation marks.</p>

<p><a href="examples/q.html">[example]</a></p>

<p><b>Block quotations with openers and closers:</b> If a block
quotation contains an opener and/or closer, as in the case of quoted
letters, newspaper articles, etc., use the &lt;quotedLetter>
element. (The &lt;q> element does not allow &lt;opener> or
&lt;closer>.) <a href="examples/quotedLetter.html">[example]</a></p>

<p>See also <a href="#letters">Letters</a></p>


<hr class="subsection" />
<h3><a name="figure"></a>Figures</h3>

<p><b>Captions and associated text:</b> When using the &lt;figure>
element to indicate non-textual content (illustrations, photographs,
maps, etc.), use the &lt;head> element to record the caption of the
figure (if any). Use the &lt;p> element to record text (if any) that
is associated with the figure but is not part of the caption. <a
href="examples/figure.html">[example]</a></p>

<p><a name="ornaments"></a>
<b>Printer's ornaments:</b> Printer's ornaments do not qualify as
figures. Instead, ornaments should be marked with:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
&lt;ornament type="ornament"/>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>See also <a href="#informal_divs">Informal divisions</a>.</p>


<hr class="subsection" />
<h3><a name="table"></a>Tables</h3>

<p><b>Header cells:</b> For cells that contain a label or heading,
rather than data, use &lt;cell role="label">. (For cells containing
data, there is no need to include the role attribute; "data" is the
default.)</p>

<p><b>Spanning rows or columns:</b> If a cell occupies more than one
row or column, use the <b>rows</b> or <b>cols</b> attribute,
respectively, on the &lt;cell> start-tag. (This is equivalent to the
use of the rowspan and colspan attributes on &lt;td> in HTML.)</p>

<p><b>Tables vs. lists:</b> In some cases, the choice between
&lt;table> and &lt;list> may not be obvious, but typically any items
of text that are intended to line up vertically should be encoded as a
&lt;table>. A table of contents, list of illustrations, etc. should
almost always be marked up as a table. Ask U.Va. Library for further guidance
if needed.</p>

<p><a href="examples/table.html">[example]</a></p>


<hr class="subsection" />
<h3><a name="list"></a>Lists</h3>

<p>Note that lists can be nested (a list &lt;item> can contain a
&lt;list>). A common use of nested lists is for indexes where each
entry contains indented sub-entries.
<a href="examples/list.html">[example]</a></p>


<hr class="subsection" />
<h3><a name="note"></a>Notes</h3>

<p><b>Note reference vs. note body:</b> By <i>note reference</i> we mean
the anchor point for the annotation within the flow of the main
text, typically indicated with a superscript number or symbol. By <i>note body</i> we mean
the content of the annotation. The most common locations for the note
body are:</p>

<ul>
<li>the bottom margin of the page (footnotes)</li>
<li>a separate "Notes" section at the end of a major structural division (endnotes)</li>
<li>the left or right margin of the page (marginal notes)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Marking the note reference</h4>

<p>In cases where the note reference is indicated by a number or
symbol, as is almost always true of footnotes and endnotes, use
&lt;ref> to encode the note reference.  <a
href="examples/footnote.html">[example]</a></p>

<p>In cases where no number or other referencing symbol is present
&mdash; as is common for marginal notes, where the physical placement
of the note on the page indicates which line or paragraph the
annotation refers to &mdash; use &lt;ptr/> to supply an anchor point
for the annotation. <!--When using &lt;ptr/>, the encoder must
<i>supply</i> a sequential number for the annotation and record this
number in the <b>n</b> attribute. Also record this number in the
<b>n</b> attribute of the corresponding &lt;note>.--> 
<a href="examples/marginal_note.html">[example]</a></p>

<p>Whether using &lt;ref> or &lt;ptr/>, always use the <b>target</b>
attribute, the value of which must match the <b>id</b> attribute of
the corresponding &lt;note>.</p>

<h4>Marking the note body</h4>

<p>Use &lt;note> to encode the note body.</p>

<p><b>Location within the XML document:</b> With the exception of
endnotes, which are already located in a separate section and should
not be moved, the &lt;note> element should occur at the point of the
note's attachment in the main text &mdash; that is, immediately after
the &lt;ref> or &lt;ptr/> element.</p>

<p class="revised"><b>Note symbols:</b> When the note body includes
the referencing symbol (a number, *, &dagger;, etc.), record this
symbol using &lt;seg type="note-symbol"> as the first element within
&lt;note>.</p>

<p><a href="examples/footnote.html">[example]</a></p>

<p><b>Required attributes:</b> Always include the <b>id</b> attribute,
which must contain an ID that is unique within the XML document, and
the <b>place</b> attribute, indicating the placement of the note on
the printed page:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>end</b> &mdash; note appears in a separate division containing all the notes for a given section</li>
<li><b>foot</b> &mdash; note appears in bottom margin</li>
<li><b>left</b> &mdash; note appears in left margin</li>
<li><b>right</b> &mdash; note appears in right margin</li>
<li><b>head</b> &mdash; note appears in top margin</li>
<li><b>inline</b> &mdash; note appears within the main body of the text</li>
<li><b>above</b> &mdash; note appears between the lines of the main text, above the line to which it refers</li>
<li><b>below</b> &mdash; note appears between the lines of the main text, below the line to which it refers</li>
</ul>

<blockquote><p><b>Note:</b> When creating IDs for notes, use a simple,
human-readable numbering scheme. For notes that are already numbered
in the print source, include the number in the ID. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the notes are numbered sequentially throughout the entire work,
use "n1", "n2", etc. (where "n" is short for "note").</li>

<li>If the note numbering starts over at 1 in each chapter, create a
unique ID by including the chapter number as well as the note
number. For example, the note IDs for the third chapter would be
"n3.1", "n3.2", etc.</li>

<li>If the note numbers or symbols start over on each page, create a
unique ID by numbering the notes sequentially within each chapter. For
example, if the 35th footnote in chapter VI is indicated by an
asterisk (*), the note body would be marked: <tt>&lt;note id="n6.35"
place="foot">&lt;ns>*&lt;/ns>...&lt;/note></tt></li>
</ul>

</blockquote>

<p><b>Unanchored notes:</b> If the note body has no corresponding
referencing symbol (notes for which &lt;ptr/> is used for the note
reference, rather than &lt;ref>; typically marginal notes), include
the <b>anchored</b> attribute with a value of "no". <a
href="examples/marginal_note.html">[example]</a></p>

<p><b>Multiple references to a single note:</b> In cases where a
printed note (typically a footnote) is pointed to by more than one
note reference, the printed note should be transcribed once
(immediately following the first &lt;ref> element), with the remaining
&lt;ref> elements pointing to that single &lt;note> element. The
&lt;note> element should <em>not</em> be repeated for each &lt;ref>
element. <a href="examples/multiple_refs.html">[example]</a></p>


<hr class="subsection" />
<h3><a name="other"></a>Other Features</h3>

<p>Arguments, bibliographic citations, epigraphs, and trailers should
be encoded as such using the appropriate TEI elements.</p>

<p>For example, an epigraph containing a quotation and a citation of
its source should be marked up in this manner:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
&lt;epigraph>
&lt;cit>
&lt;q>"I have sworn upon the altar of God &lt;lb/>
eternal hostility against every form of tyranny &lt;lb/>
over the mind of man."&lt;/q>
&lt;bibl>&lt;author> &amp;mdash; &lt;i>Thomas Jefferson.&lt;/i>&lt;/author>&lt;/bibl>
&lt;/cit>
&lt;/epigraph>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>An argument (a leading section containing a summary of the content
that follows it) is often presented as a series of topics separated by
long dashes. An argument should be marked as an &lt;argument>, not as
a second &lt;head>. <a href="examples/argument.html">[example]</a></p>


<hr />
<h2><a name="V"></a>Phrase-level Features</h2>

<h3><a name="typeface"></a>Changes in Typeface</h3>

<p>With one exception, changes in typeface should be marked with the
appropriate <i>physical</i> element, not with a <i>logical</i> element
such as &lt;emph>, &lt;title>, &lt;term>, &lt;mentioned>, etc. The
exception is foreign phrases, which should be marked with &lt;foreign>
(see <a href="#foreign">Foreign Phrases</a>). When marking changes in
typeface, use the following elements:</p>

<ul>
<li>&lt;i> ... &lt;/i> : <i>italics</i><br /><br /></li>
<li>&lt;b> ... &lt;/b> : <b>bold</b><br /><br /></li>
<li>&lt;u> ... &lt;/u> : <span style="text-decoration: underline">underline</span><br /><br /></li>
<li>&lt;sup> ... &lt;/sup> : <sup>superscript</sup><br /><br /></li>
<li>&lt;sub> ... &lt;/sub> : <sub>subscript</sub><br /><br /></li>
<li>&lt;smcap> ... &lt;/smcap> : <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Small Caps</span><br /><br /></li>
<li>&lt;hi rend="..."> ... &lt;/hi> : All other typographic changes</li>
</ul>

<blockquote><p><b>Note on &lt;smcap>:</b> Text that is printed in small
caps should be transcribed using both upper-case and lower-case
letters, <i>not</i> all upper-case letters. 
<a href="examples/smcap.html">[example]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>When using &lt;hi> for changes in typeface, use one of the
following values for the <b>rend</b> attribute:</p>

<ul>
<li>gothic</li>
<li>line-through</li>
<li>overline</li>
<li>red-letter</li>
<li>roman - assumed and not normally necessary</li>
<li>other - indicate rendering using the <b>other</b> attribute, as
in: <tt>&lt;hi rend="other" other="..."></tt></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="examples/hi.html">[example of gothic typeface]</a></p>


<hr class="subsection" />
<h3><a name="align"></a>Alignment and Indentation</h3>

<p>When indicating alignment or indentation, use the globally
available <b>rend</b> attribute, either on structural elements
(&lt;p>, &lt;l>, &lt;cell>, &lt;item>, etc.) or on &lt;hi>, as
appropriate to the situation.</p>

<p>For indicating alignment, the <b>rend</b> value may be:</p>

<ul>
<li>center</li>
<li>left - assumed and not normally necessary</li>
<li>right</li>
</ul>

<p>For indicating indentation, <b>rend</b> may be:</p>

<ul>
<li>indent</li>

<li>indent2, indent3, indent4, indent5 - for cases where more than one
level of indentation needs to be recorded (Use these values sparingly,
and only when "indent" has already been used. Normally these values
are only needed when encoding lines of verse.)</li>

<li>hang - for hanging indentation</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Default alignment:</b> Some elements have a presumed or default
alignment and do not normally require explicit alignment markup:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>head</b> - center</li>
<li><b>table</b> - center</li>
<li><b>figure</b> - center</li>
<li>elements within &lt;titlePage> - center</li>
<li><b>trailer</b> - center</li>
<li><b>ornament</b> - center</li>
<li><b>dateline</b> - right</li>
<li><b>salute</b> within &lt;opener> - left</li>
<li><b>salute</b> within &lt;closer> - right, with some indentation toward the left</li>
<li><b>signed</b> - right</li>
<li>all other elements - left</li>
</ul>

<p>These elements should contain alignment markup <em>only</em> when
the layout of the element on the printed page differs from the
defaults listed above.</p>


<hr class="subsection" />
<h3><a name="foreign"></a>Foreign Phrases</h3>

<p><b>Using &lt;foreign>:</b> Words or phrases that are both (a)
typographically distinct (usually in italics), and (b) not in the main
language of the text (almost always English), should be marked with
the &lt;foreign> element. Whenever possible, include the <b>lang</b>
attribute, using one of the standard
<a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php">ISO
639-2 three-character language codes</a>. Occasionally, the language
will not be obvious, in which case encode the phrase with &lt;foreign>
but without the <b>lang</b> attribute. Commonly used ISO 639-2 codes
include:</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="3">
<tr>
<td>fre</td><td>French</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>ger</td><td>German</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>grc</td><td>Greek, ancient (to 1453)</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>gre</td><td>Greek, modern (1453- )</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>heb</td><td>Hebrew</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>ita</td><td>Italian</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>lat</td><td>Latin</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>rus</td><td>Russian</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>spa</td><td>Spanish</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Each language identified by a <b>lang</b> attribute (on
&lt;foreign>, or on any other element) must be declared in a
&lt;language> element within
&lt;teiHeader>&lt;profileDesc>&lt;langUsage> in order for the XML
document to validate.</p>

<p><a href="examples/foreign.html">[example]</a></p>

<p><b>Retaining typographic distinction:</b> Using the &lt;foreign>
element does not obviate the need to encode the change in
typeface. Since foreign phrases are usually italicized, typical markup
for a foreign phrase will be: &lt;foreign
lang="...">&lt;i>...&lt;/i>&lt;/foreign></p>

<p><b>Not roman but not Asian:</b> Languages such as Greek, Hebrew,
and Russian fall into a special category. They require non-roman
characters, but they are alphabetic, not ideographic. If the language
is within the vendor's capabilities, the foreign phrase should be
transcribed using either the appropriate character entities, or XML
character references with Unicode hexadecimal values:</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="3">
<tr>
<td>Greek</td>
<td>Use the <a
href="http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/specs/wd-docbook-xmlcharent-0.3.html#isogrk1">iso-grk1.ent character entities</a>, supplemented as
needed by the accented characters in iso-grk2.ent</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Hebrew</td>
<td>Use the Hebrew block of Unicode (0590 - 05FF): &amp;#x05D0; for aleph,
&amp;#x05D1; for beth, etc.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Russian</td><td>Use the Cyrillic block of Unicode (0400 - 04FF)</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>If the language is <i>not</i> within the vendor's capabilities,
omit the characters from the transcription and use the &lt;gap/>
element.</p>

<p>Ask U.Va. Library for further guidance if needed.</p>

href="#charent">Special Characters</a>.</p>


<hr class="subsection" />
<h3><a name="punctuation"></a>Punctuation</h3>

<p><b>Standard keyboard punctuation:</b> Most common punctuation
characters can and should be represented using their normal keyboard
characters:</p>

<ul>
<li>exclamation point !</li>
<li>dollar sign $</li>
<li>percent sign %</li>
<li>asterisk *</li>
<li>opening and closing parentheses ( )</li>
<li>hyphen -</li>
<li>opening and closing square brackets [ ]</li>
<li>opening and closing braces { }</li>
<li>colon :</li>
<li>semicolon ;</li>
<li>double quotation mark "</li>
<li>single quotation mark and apostrophe '</li>
<li>comma ,</li>
<li>period .</li>
<li>solidus (forward slash) /</li>
<li>question mark ?</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Use of entities:</b> Other marks of punctuation must be
represented using their standard character entities:</p>

<ul>
<li>ampersand &amp;amp; (as required by XML)</li>

<li>em dash &amp;mdash; (long dash)</li>

<li>en dash &amp;ndash; (medium-length dash, often used to indicate a
range, e.g. 1783&amp;ndash;1804)</li>
</ul>

<p>An ellipse &mdash; a series of dots or asterisks indicating
deliberately omitted text &mdash; should be indicated by a series of
keyboard-character periods or asterisks. Simply use the same number of
periods or asterisks used in the print source.</p>

<p>If the print source contains an exceptionally long space that needs
to be preserved (for example, to indicate a word deliberately omitted
by the author), use a series of &amp;emsp; (em space) entities.</p>

<p>Other marks of punctuation are available in the iso-num.ent,
iso-pub.ent, and iso-tech.ent character entity sets. See <a
href="#charent">Special Characters</a> below.</p>

<p><b>Spacing between sentences:</b> Use one space character between
sentences, not two, regardless of the apparent spacing in the print
source.</p>



<hr />
<h2><a name="VI"></a>VI. Reference Systems</h2>

<h3><a name="pb"></a>Page Breaks</h3>

<p>Use &lt;pb/> to mark page breaks &mdash; that is, to mark the point
at which a page begins.</p>

<p><b>Always at top of page:</b> The &lt;pb/> element should always be
placed at the top or beginning of the page, regardless of the position
of the printed page number in the print source.</p>

<p><b>Page numbers:</b> If the page contains a printed page number,
record it in the <b>n</b> attribute; if not, do not include the
<b>n</b> attribute. <span class="revised"><b>Exception:</b>For &lt;pb/> elements indicating spine, covers, and edges, include the <b>n</b> with an appropriate label, such as <code>n="Front Cover"</code>. See <a href="#spine">Images for Book Spine, Covers, and Edges</a>.</span></p>

<p><b>Always within a div:</b> Page breaks must be placed
<em>within</em> a &lt;div#> element, never between
divisions. Therefore, when a division starts on a new page, the
&lt;pb/> is the first element in the division, immediately following
the opening &lt;div#> tag (preceding even the division &lt;head>, if
there is one). For example:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
&lt;/div2>
&lt;div2 type="chapter" n="II">
<span class="hi">&lt;pb/></span>
&lt;head>II&amp;mdash;APPELLATIONS.&lt;/head>
</pre></blockquote>

<p><b>Blank pages:</b> There must be one &lt;pb/> element for every
page in the set of page images for the work. This is true even for
pages that have no text or other printed content on them.</p>

<p>If the blank page occurs between divs, place the blank page's
&lt;pb/> element as the last page of the preceding div, not as the
first page of the new div.</p>

<blockquote><pre>
&lt;!-- end of last chapter -->&lt;/p>
<span class="hi">&lt;pb/></span> &lt;!-- blank page between last chapter and bibliography -->
&lt;/div1>
&lt;/body>
&lt;back>
&lt;div1 type="bibliography">
&lt;pb/>
&lt;head>BIBLIOGRAPHY&lt;/head>
</pre></blockquote>

<p><b>Running page headers:</b> Normally running page headers should
be excluded from the electronic text (see <a
href="#exceptions">Exceptions</a>).  In some cases, however, U.Va. Library will
specifically request that the running headers be preserved for a
particular book. To encode the running headers, use &lt;fw
type="header"> within &lt;pb>:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
&lt;pb n="99">&lt;fw type="header">APPEAL TO CHURCHES OF MASSACHUSETTS&lt;/fw>&lt;/pb>
</pre></blockquote>


<hr class="subsection" />
<h3><a name="cb"></a>Column Breaks</h3>

<p>Use the &lt;cb/> element to mark column breaks &mdash; that is, to
mark the point at which a column of text begins. Of course, many books
have a single-column layout, in which case it is not necessary to mark
the column at all. Other materials, however, such as dictionaries,
encyclopedias, newspapers, and journals, are commonly printed in
multiple columns and require the use of &lt;cb/> to indicate the
layout.</p>

<p><b>Always at top:</b> Like <a href="#pb">page breaks</a>
(&lt;pb/>), which should always be placed at the top of the page,
&lt;cb/> should always mark the top or beginning of the column of
text.</p>

<p><b>n attribute:</b> For &lt;cb/>, use the n attribute to record the
number of the column on the page. If each page contains two columns,
the first (leftmost) column on each page is &lt;cb n="1"/>, and the
second column is &lt;cb n="2"/>.</p>

<p><b>Mixed column layouts:</b> In cases where the number of columns
changes mid-page, use the &lt;cols/> element to indicate the point at
which the number of columns changes. Use the <b>n</b> attribute to
indicate the number of columns in the section that follows the
&lt;cols/> tag. For example, if the page layout shifts from
single-column to double-column in the midst of the page, use &lt;cols
n="2"/> to indicate the point at which double-column layout begins
(and then use &lt;cb n="1"/> and &lt;cb n="2"/> to mark the columns,
as usual). At the point where the layout shifts back to single-column
text, use &lt;cols n="1"/> (after which no &lt;cb/> elements are
necessary, since the layout is single-column). <a
href="examples/mixedcol.html">[example]</a></p>

<blockquote><p><b>Note:</b> A division &lt;head> followed by a
multi-column layout does <em>not</em> indicate a mixed-column layout
and does not require &lt;cols&nbsp;n="..."/>.
<a href="examples/cb.html">[example]</a></p></blockquote>


<hr class="subsection" />
<h3><a name="lb"></a>Line Breaks</h3>

<p>Line breaks in running prose should be preserved in the electronic
transcription by marking the end of each printed line with the
standard &lt;lb/> element.</p>



<hr />
<h2><a name="VII"></a>Special Considerations</h2>

<h3><a name="gapunclear"></a>Gaps and Uncertainties</h3>

<p>The &lt;unclear> and &lt;gap/> elements should be used as follows:</p>

<p><a name="unclear"></a><b>&lt;unclear>:</b> Use &lt;unclear> to mark
passages that cannot be transcribed with certainty, as happens when a
letter/word/phrase is physically present on the page but is
<b>unreadable</b> (due to a printing error, physical damage to the
page such as readers' marks, or a bad scan).</p>

<p>When marking an illegible letter/word/phrase as unclear, transcribe
the readable characters, omit the unreadable characters, and mark the
<em>entire</em> word or phrase with &lt;unclear>...&lt;/unclear>. For
example:</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Correct:</b></p>
<pre>lost, wounded or captured in a fruitless and &lt;lb/>
&lt;unclear>opeless&lt;/unclear> assault. &lt;lb/> </pre>

<p><b class="hi"><i>Wrong:</i></b></p>
<pre>lost, wounded or captured in a fruitless and &lt;lb/>
&lt;unclear/>opeless assault. &lt;lb/> </pre>
</blockquote>

<p><b>Note:</b> If one or more illegible characters come immediately before or after
an end-of-line hyphen, include the <em>entire</em> hyphenated word
within the &lt;unclear> element. For example:</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Correct:</b></p>
<pre>cleared his throat, and quietly withdrew, &lt;unclear>maintain- &lt;lb/>
ing&lt;/unclear> to the last his unprejudiced demeanour.&lt;/p></pre>

<p><b class="hi"><i>Wrong:</i></b></p>
<pre>cleared his throat, and quietly withdrew, maintain- &lt;lb/>
&lt;unclear>ing&lt;/unclear> to the last his unprejudiced demeanour.&lt;/p></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>If a word or phrase is so illegible that none of its characters can
be read with certainty, use an empty &lt;unclear/> element to mark the
point at which the word or phrase occurs:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
instead of his sargeant; and therefore no regiment &lt;lb/>
&lt;unclear/> to be seen in which there are not soldiers in &lt;lb/>
</pre></blockquote>

<p><a name="gap"></a><b>&lt;gap/>:</b> Use &lt;gap/> to mark any
section (character, word, passage, page, etc.) that is being
<b>omitted</b> from the transcription. There are two reasons for such
omissions: the section is missing (as happens with torn or missing
pages), or it has been excluded deliberately for editorial reasons. In
particular, a block of non-Western characters in a language outside
the vendor's capabilities should be marked as a &lt;gap/>. Use one
&lt;gap/> element for each unbroken section of content that is being
excluded from the electronic transcription. (See also <a
href="#charent">Special Characters</a>.)</p>

<p>When using the &lt;gap/> element, include the <b>desc</b> (short
for "description") and <b>reason</b> attributes. The <b>reason</b>
attribute accepts these values:</p>

<ul>
<li>editorial - the section is omitted deliberately for editorial
reasons (for example, non-Western characters)</li>

<li>damage - the section is omitted because of damage to the physical
page (for example, a torn page)</li>

<li>missing - the section is missing entirely (for example, a missing page)</li>

<li>other - indicate the reason in the "other" attribute, as in:
<tt>&lt;gap desc="..." reason="other" other="..."/></tt></li>
</ul>

<blockquote><p>Examples:</p>
<pre>
&lt;gap desc="Chinese characters" reason="editorial"/>

&lt;gap desc="page 43, line 17 to end of page" reason="damage"/>
</pre>
</blockquote>


<hr class="subsection" />
<h3><a name="ab_seg"></a>Arbitrary Sections</h3>

<p>In texts with complex structure or layout, the encoder is likely to
encounter block-level sections or phrase-level passages that are
difficult to fit into any of the standard TEI elements. In such cases,
it may be best to take advantage of TEI's elements for arbitrary
sections:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>&lt;ab></b> - (anonymous block) occurs at the block level (at
same level as &lt;p>, &lt;table>, &lt;list>, etc.)</li>

<li><b>&lt;seg></b> - (segment) occurs at the phrase level (within
&lt;p>, table cells, list items, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Both of these elements accept the <b>type</b> attribute with any
value (no predefined vocabulary).</p>

<p>Although these elements should be used sparingly, they are very
useful when genuinely needed.</p>

<blockquote><p>
<span class="hi"><b>IMPORTANT:</b></span> It is better to use
&lt;ab> or &lt;seg>, when appropriate, than to inject inappropriate
markup &mdash; such as &lt;div#> elements that do not truly reflect
the major structural divisions of the work, or &lt;p> elements that
are not really paragraphs &mdash; for the sake of "making it parse."
</p></blockquote>

<p>If a work contains a particularly problematic feature for which the
preferred encoding is not clear, ask U.Va. Library for further guidance.</p>


<hr class="subsection" />
<h3><a name="charent"></a>Special Characters</h3>

<p>Character-entity sets are not declared in the external
DTD. Instead, you will need to declare and invoke any entity sets
required by a given document in the document's internal subset:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
&lt;?xml version='1.0'?>
&lt;!DOCTYPE TEI.2 SYSTEM '<i>[path]</i>/tei2.dtd' [

<p>The usual ISO 8879 (SGML) entity sets are included with the
uva-dl-tei DTD files (see <a href="#dtd">The DTD</a> above). Please do
not use your own, local versions of the ISO 8879 entity sets, as our
versions may include corrections, as well as a supplementary set
containing characters not available in the standard sets
(uva-supp.ent).</p>

<p>Use the named (mnemonic) entities from the U.Va.-supplied entity sets
whenever possible. In working with XML character-entity sets, you may
want to refer to the following resources:</p>

<ul>
<li><cite>XML Character Entities</cite><br />
<a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/specs/wd-docbook-xmlcharent-0.3.html">http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/specs/wd-docbook-xmlcharent-0.3.html</a>

<br />
Contains links to PDF code charts of Unicode characters, organized by
category (that is, by Unicode block).</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Characters not in a standard entity set:</b> If a character is
not in one of the U.Va.-supplied entity sets (don't forget to check
uva-supp.ent as well as the ISO 8879 sets), it may nevertheless be
available as a Unicode character. In such cases, identify the correct
Unicode character and declare it as an entity with an appropriate
human-readable name.</p>

<p><b>Characters not in Unicode:</b> In some cases, a particular
character may not be available in Unicode. It is usually possible,
however, to create the needed character by using the Unicode combining
diacritics.</p>

<p><a href="examples/charent.html">[example]</a></p>

<p>Any such entity declarations outside the U.Va.-supplied entity sets
should be noted in the encoder's notes to U.Va. Library (see <a
