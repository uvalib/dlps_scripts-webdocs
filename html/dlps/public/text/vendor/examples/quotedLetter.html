tions be taken by them to be applied in mitigation of the &lt;lb/>
misery caused by the enactment of the Fugitive Slave Law. &lt;lb/>
The boldness and originality of such an appeal, and more &lt;lb/>
especially the evident purpose of its framers to create senti- &lt;lb/>
ment by this means among the religious societies, entitle it to &lt;lb/>
consideration. The first circular was sent out soon after the &lt;lb/>
enactment of the odious law, and the second soon after the &lt;lb/>
passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act. The results secured by &lt;lb/>
the two circulars will be seen in the following letter from &lt;lb/>
Francis Jackson, of Boston, to his fellow-townsmen and co- &lt;lb/>
worker, the Rev. Theodore Parker.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;i>Dear Friend&lt;/i>,&amp;mdash; The contributions of the churches in behalf of &lt;lb/>
the fugitive slaves I think have about all come in. I herewith &lt;lb/>
inclose you a schedule thereof, amounting in all to about $800, &lt;lb/>
being but &lt;i>little more than half as much as they contributed in 1851&lt;/i>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Mass. Register published in January, 1854, states the &lt;lb/>
number of Religious Societies to be 1,547 (made up of 471 Ortho- &lt;lb/>
dox, 270 Methodist, and all others 239). We sent circulars to the &lt;lb/>
whole 1,547; only 78 of them have responded&amp;mdash; say 1 in 20&amp;mdash; &lt;lb/>
from 130 Universalist societies, nothing, from 43 Episcopal $4, &lt;lb/>
and 20 Friends $27&amp;mdash; the Baptists&amp;mdash; four times as many of these &lt;lb/>
societies have given now as gave in 1851, this may be because &lt;lb/>
Burns was a Baptist minister.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The average amount contributed by 77 societies (deducting Froth- &lt;lb/>
ingham of Salem) is $10 each; the 28th Congregationalist Church &lt;lb/>
in this city did not take up a contribution, nevertheless, indi- &lt;lb/>
vidual members thereof subscribed upwards of $300; they being &lt;lb/>
&lt;i>infidel&lt;/i> have not been reckoned with the churches.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of the cities and large towns scarce any have contributed. &lt;lb/>
Of the 90 and 9 in Boston all have gone astray but 2&amp;mdash; I have &lt;lb/>
not heard of our circular being read in one of them; still it may &lt;lb/>
have been. Those societies who have contributed, I judge were &lt;lb/>
least able to do so.&lt;/p>
