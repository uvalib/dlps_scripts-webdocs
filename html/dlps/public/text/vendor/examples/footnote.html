&lt;p>An excellent little volume by the learned and reliable bibliographer, &lt;lb/>
Don Joaquin Garcia Icazbalceta, on the subject of books on the American &lt;lb/>
aboriginal languages has lately appeared. It is entitled &lt;i>Apuntes para &lt;lb/>
un cataloga de Escritores en lenguas indmgenos de America&lt;/i>. &lt;smcap>Mexico&lt;/smcap> en la &lt;lb/>
imprenta particular del autor, 1866. 12mo.&amp;mdash;&lt;i>B&lt;/i>.&lt;/p><span class="hi">&lt;/note></span>

&lt;p>Dr. Robertson prefixed to the seventh edition of his &lt;lb/>
history, a list of Spanish books and manuscripts, which he &lt;lb/>
consulted for that work.<span class="hi">&lt;ref target="n8.2"></span>&lt;sup>2&lt;/sup><span class="hi">&lt;/ref></span>
<span class="hi">&lt;note id="n8.2" place="foot">&lt;seg type="note-symbol">&lt;sup>2&lt;/sup>&lt;/seg></span>&lt;p>An extract from Robertson's list, which, with some additions, was in- &lt;lb/>

&lt;p>It evidently appears, that the most voluminous and &lt;lb/>
expensive works were published by the Spaniards; and &lt;lb/>
this is not altogether strange, as they possessed by far the &lt;lb/>
richest part of the country; and the settlement of the &lt;lb/>
southern part of the continent, and of Mexico, commenced &lt;lb/>
a century before that of the British colonies.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A printing press was early introduced into the Spanish &lt;lb/>
part of this island; probably about the beginning of the &lt;lb/>
seventeenth century. It was seldom used, except for &lt;lb/>
printing the lists and returns, and other papers for the &lt;lb/>
different branches of the administration.&lt;/p>

in his Description of the Spanish &lt;lb/>
part of St. Domingo, informs us, that "No works con- &lt;lb/>
cerning the colonies can be printed in them, without the &lt;lb/>
permission of the council of the Indies, and it is well &lt;lb/>
known that the council is not over fond of granting such &lt;lb/>
permissions. In the examination of the vessels that arrive, &lt;lb/>
strict search is made after the books proscribed by the &lt;lb/>
