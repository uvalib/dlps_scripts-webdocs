            <p>
            Well, how is
            every little thing, and
            your health?  Have I
            told you that Thaw and
            Johnson are back and
            they report a marvelous
            time in the States?  All
            the women in New York &mdash;
            married and debutants  [sic]&mdash; will
            now sleep with one, and
            
            <pb n="[p.2]"/>
            
            as a whole Babylon looks
            like a Sunday school along -
            side.  I’m tempted to take
            my permission over there.
            </p><p>
            To day was the first
            flying day in a long time.
            We went out ten strong &mdash;
            more than ever before.  I
            went down on two Boches
            with Bill &amp; “Havi” but my
            Nieuport was brought down
            by French cannon &mdash; another
                        
            <pb n="[p.3]"/>
            
            a Boche dropped and poor
            Sauvage, the “AS” was hit
            by German shrapnel.  Lieut.
            de la Tour, who was next
            to him, said he fell from
            3,000 meters in 10 seconds, but
            that’s not possible.  Anyway
            he was to come to dinner
            with us tomorrow night
            with four others, and now
            there will be only four
            guests.
            </p><p>
            I never have been so shot
            
            <pb n="[p.4]"/>
            
            at as today, save one time
            over Douaumont.  My mirror
            showed all black from the
            shells busting near my tail.
            </p><p>
            “Luff” wants to go on leave
            now so I’ll put mine off.
            Let me know your plans
            so as I can arrange.
            </p><p>
            How did you make out
            on exchange with pen?  Let
            me know and charge any extra
            cost to me.
            </p>
