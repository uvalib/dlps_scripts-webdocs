            My dear Marcelle, don’t you
            know me well enough yet to
            realize I was joking you?  You
            see I saw the chance to catch
            you up on the way you had
            worded your letter and thought
            I’d do it.   I’m glad, anyway,
            for it forced an additional
            note out of you.  You must
            think I’m an idiot if you 
            believed me serious.  Paul
            always said you would bite
            at anything.
            </p><p>
            This morning a phone message
            came asking us to go to the
            Mairie to meet a high official<unclear>[.]</unclear>
            Lovell and I and three others
            went over.  A number of cars
            were drawn up in the Place
            Duroc.  One bore the flag of
            the President of France.  We
            were to meet Poincare.  We 
            drew up inside of the sand
            bag inclosed [sic] arcade.  The President
            and his entourage passed.  He
            stopped in front of us.  “One 
            finds you everywhere”, he said.
            
            (over)
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0208" n="[p.2]"/>
            
            “You are very devoted”[.]  He shook 
            us each by the hand, saluted,
            and passed on.  We wandered to 
            the end of the arcade to watch 
            the party go down a side street.
            A sentry there engaged us in
            conversation.  He addressed himself
            to Pottle.  “Did he shake hands
            with you?” he asked.  “Sure” says
            Pottle.  “Hell,” said the man on 
            post “He isn’t a bit proud is
            he?”
            </p><p>
            There’s a tri-color hanging from
            the front of the Mairie.  As we
            motored out I looked out the
            back of the car and saw it
            slowly fade in the heavy
            snow storm &mdash; I was immediately
            carried back to St. Pierre Miquelon.
            Whenever I see a French flag
            through the snow I shall, I
            think, always recollect those little
            islands and our trip there &mdash;
            and you.
            </p><p>
            Am sending this into Paris
            to be mailed. Will follow in
            near future.
            </p>
