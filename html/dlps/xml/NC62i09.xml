                <p> Charles provides Adelaide with a brief overview of his daily routine and of the
                    enlisted men's opinions of their commanders, including a few barbed comments
                    about his own division commander, General Green. After relating some current
                    rumors about enemy activity in the region, he dismisses them with the assurance
                    that he never pays attention to such gossip. He defends General Geary against
                    recent charges of destruction and cowardice, made against him in the Cleveland
                    Leader, and maintains that no better Brigadier General exists, than John. W.
                    Geary. He closes with an appeal for a longer letter. </p>

                <p> Your very short, but withal kind letter of<lb/> Aug. 18<hi rend="super">th</hi>,
                        I <orig reg="received">recieved</orig> yesterday, and although there is no
                    certainty<lb/> of a chance to send it, I will reply to it today. You will
                    forgive<lb/> me for writing on so poor quality of paper, when I tell you that
                    mine<lb/> is all with the company wagon, and this sheet is all I could
                    obtain<lb/> out here in the woods. You will wonder why I do not oftener<add
                        hand="h1" place="supralinear">write</add> to you<lb/> and what can induce me
                    to remain silent for so long a time, I wrote<lb/> you a letter a few days since,
                    but could not send it until a day before <orig reg="yesterday.">yes=<lb/>
                    terday.</orig> &mdash;In it, I gave you a very hasty sketch of what we had
                    been doing for<lb/> the two or three weeks previous, and said "when we could
                    remain 24<lb/> hours in a place, I had much to write you. Although we have
                    remained<lb/> in our present position for nearly forty eight hours, we know not
                    how<lb/> soon we may move three, ten or twenty miles, but I will do all I can
                    in<lb/> the interim. My health (notwithstanding the constant exposure)<lb/>
                    remains in excellent condition, which I consider somewhat remarkable, as<lb/>
                    the officers who are much better cared for than the men, and very many<lb/> of
                    the men are suffering from Colds. summer complaints, <orig reg="etc."
                    >&amp;c.</orig> Perhaps<lb/> it is owing to your prayers, and your wish for
                    me to care for my health.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p> I think I will give you a <foreign lang="fre">
                        <hi rend="underline">resume</hi>
                    </foreign> of my daily routine. My first<lb/> work after roll-call, is to
                    prepare my breakfast, consisting of a cup of coffee&mdash;<lb/> some fried
                    meat and crackers &mdash; and a dish of stewed apples or peaches. (both<lb/>
                    are very plenty here.) After B. until noon, I read papers etc. then comes<lb/>
                    dinner of Coffee &amp; crackers.&mdash;then reading, and making
                        entries <sic corr="in">im</sic> my journal<lb/> until night, then prepare
                    supper. [<foreign lang="lat">vide</foreign> Breakfast.] Thus you will<lb/> see
                    that time must <orig reg="necessarily">nece&longs;sarily</orig> lag, and <orig
                        reg="pass">pa&longs;s</orig> wearily by. Occasionally, we can<lb/> get
                    up a spirited and lively "confab" relating to the topics of the day, in
                    which<lb/> Generals have to <orig reg="pass">pa&longs;s</orig> a rigid
                    criticism, not always favorable; but then, our<lb/> opinions do not make any

                    <name type="person">Green</name>. When <abbr expan="Generals">Gens.</abbr> <name

                    which, by his too familiar manners, and the supercilious way<lb/> he treats
                    officers in the Ohio regiments, he has rendered himself completely<lb/>
                    <pb n="2" entity="DSSR_000000766_0622"/> obnoxious, and whenever he makes his
                    appearance, he is met with<lb/> "Here comes Greeney!" "Hurrah for our green
                    general!" &mdash;and the like.<lb/> A couple of conundrums are going the
                    rounds.&mdash; "Why is the 2<hi rend="super">d</hi> division<lb/> the<hi
                        rend="underline">bore</hi> of the army?" "Because it is <name type="person">
                        <hi rend="underline">Augur</hi>
                    </name>'s." "Why is it now very<lb/> unpopular?" "Because it has a<hi
                        rend="underline">green</hi> commander." <name type="person">Green</name> has
                    a son<lb/> who is one of his <orig reg="aides-de-camp">aidecamps</orig>, He is a
                    very verdant looking fellow, and he<lb/> evidently adores his mustache which is
                    scarcely perceptible, but<lb/> he is more popular than his father.
                        Latterly, <name type="person">Green</name> has acquired the<lb/> cognomen of
                    "Night hawk," pecause he moves us so much after night,<lb/>
                </p>
                <p> Very likely, your curiosity is aroused to know why we are in line of<lb/> battle
                    here so long, instead of being in camp. <orig reg="Rumor">Rumer</orig> has it
                    that<lb/> the rebels are in force in front of us, but we form the center line -
                        or <del hand="h1" rend="line-through">reser</del> <add hand="h1"
                        place="supralinear">reserve,</add><lb/> and we wait a demonstration upon our
                    front. I hardly think they<lb/> will make a push this way, though I learn they
                    have taken <name type="place">Frederick</name><lb/> I have heard also that the
