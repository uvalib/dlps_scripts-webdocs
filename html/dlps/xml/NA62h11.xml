    <p>Another day has gone, and <lb/> has the day benefited me. or I it? I have learn= <lb/> =ed
     something I trust. if I am not benefited <lb/> The little Lissie of whom I have written before
     I <lb/> believe gave me a little trouble to day, I "passed <lb/> a rule" at the commencement of
     my school. <lb/> that those who did not pay good attention in <lb/> their spelling class must
     go below the one who <lb/> spelled their word, and to day Lissie missed <lb/> her turn. The one
     who spelled her word. <lb/> she refused to let go above her, I firmly <lb/> but kindly told her
     to stand down, she <lb/> refused and I commanded her telling her <lb/>
     <pb n="2" entity="DSSR_000000766_0180"/> I should punish her if she disobeyed, Now <lb/> I
     never threaten withoug executing, and I am <lb/> sorry to say. I was obliged to punish her
     <lb/> Perhaps you would have laughed could you <lb/> have seen your Addie dealing the blows so
      <hi rend="underline">un= <lb/> mercifully</hi>. but I thought that if in <unclear/>
     <lb/> instance I "spared the rod" I would surely <lb/> "spoil the child" Although the "rod" was
     nothing <lb/> but my hand delivering <hi rend="underline">two</hi> blows on her head <lb/> it
     had the desired effect, As it is the first <lb/> time one of my scholars have so openly
     rebelled <lb/> it troubled me some. Am I not a good <unclear>[girls?]</unclear>
     <lb/> to tell you of all my troubles? But I am neglect <lb/> ing my duty I fear. </p>
    <p>Your darling letter of the 26<hi rend="super">th</hi>
     <unclear/> I recieved <lb/> Saturday and have had no time to answer <lb/> till to day, monday,
     I was sorry to <lb/> learn that you had again left <unclear/> again <lb/> to face the enemy.
     Are you thoroughly <unclear/>
     <lb/> my darling? so that you can endure the fatigue <lb/> of long marches as well as run: I
     know <unclear> that </unclear>
     <lb/> so <unclear>far</unclear> you have been <hi rend="underline">blessed doubly blessed</hi>
     with <lb/> good health. but as a general thing. <unclear>when[?]</unclear>
     <lb/>
     <pb n="3" entity="DSSR_000000766_0181"/> disease comes it is harder <del hand="h1">wh</del>
     with the <lb/> healthiest, Do not therefore relinquish one bit <lb/> of your care in regard to
     your health. But <lb/> you will say this is idle <unclear>tolls[?]</unclear> for me will <lb/>
     you not dear? You <hi rend="underline">may</hi> but if you do you <lb/> know not how anxious I
     am for you. <hi rend="underline">my own</hi>
     <lb/>
    </p>
    <p>I know darlint that <hi rend="underline">we ladies</hi> are <unclear>[June?]</unclear> noble
     <lb/> patriots. and we are proud of it. There is no <lb/> sacrifice too great for us to make if
     it <unclear/>
     <lb/> our country or the noble defenders of it. <lb/> You may call us such withuot exerting any
     <lb/> yourself to find <hi rend="underline">any flattery</hi> Did it know <lb/> dearest that I
     had ceased to regard any thing you <lb/> say as <hi rend="underline">flattery</hi>? I take it
     all as good sub= <lb/> stantial truth. <lb/>
    </p>
    <p>One sentence in your etter dearest. I can not read <lb/> without <hi rend="underline"
     >such</hi> a pain in my heart. it is this <lb/> "My life is nothing, if by its sacrifice. our
     country <lb/> can be saved" Charlie. I am calm now. when I say <lb/> that if that sacrifice
     must be made. <hi rend="underline">my life <lb/> also shall be sacrificed.</hi>
     <unclear>[S or G]o</unclear> if needs be. lay <lb/> down your life upon the alter of our
     country. but <lb/> mine shall follow. As there is a God in heaven <lb/>
     <pb n="4" entity="DSSR_000000766_0182"/> it shall. Do not say I <unclear/>. for <lb/> I am not.
     My heart can never say amen <unclear/> your <lb/> senence unless yours does to <unclear/> I
     have just written <lb/>
    </p>
    <p>Dearest you say I or "we" can help to raise <lb/> volunteers by politely inviting such as Mr. <unclear/>
     <lb/> to serve their country or be considered as traitor, <lb/> Indeed Charlie I have treated
     him with so much <lb/> reserve that I scarcely ever have the opportunity of <lb/> seeing him
     The <unclear>shirt</unclear> you sent me of <lb/> the "irish mans <unclear/> " looks rather
     comical <unclear/>
     <lb/> must <unclear/> . "Paddy" meant to have a fresh <lb/> supply did he not? But it is time
     for me <lb/> to go. I had three new scholars to day. I <lb/> will try and write more in the
     morning good night <lb/> my precious Charlie May sweet dreams be thine. D <unclear/>
     <lb/> of Addie with you? </p>
    <p>Good morning loved Charlie. </p>
    <p> I have just come <unclear/>
     <lb/> school-room through the rain. and now I sh <unclear/> write <lb/> a few minutes or at
     least till my scholars come <lb/> How did my darling pass the <unclear>horors</unclear> of last <unclear/>
     <lb/> and I wish peacefully did you not <lb/> I was very tired last eve but I had such
     <unclear/> refreshing <lb/>
     <unclear/> last <unclear/> that I feel perfectly well now </p>
    <p>What a warm day was yesterday. I do not think I <lb/> have suffered from the head so bad this
     summer as I <lb/> did yesterday. but quite a shower came up in the <lb/> night, and this
     morning the atmosphere is not so <lb/> oppressive.</p>

    <p>Charlie do you not think we have a <lb/> great many--what should I call
     them--<unclear>chafe</unclear> patriots <lb/> in our army? It seems from what I can hear
      <unclear>that</unclear>
     <lb/> we have. They manage to get most of the jobs and <lb/>
     <unclear> for </unclear> the army than fill very <unclear>imper <lb/> fectly</unclear> the
     orders with inferior articles and sell for the <lb/> highest price. consequently our soldiers
     have to endure <lb/> many needless privations and sufferings which ought <lb/> to be prevented
     Those having charge of the <unclear/>
     <lb/> are to blame for not preventing it <lb/> How can men be so inhuman to thus speculate
     <lb/> at the <unclear>[expense?]</unclear> of the soldiers. <unclear>[Such?]</unclear> are worse <lb/> than
     <unclear/> the same <unclear>fate[?]</unclear>
     <lb/>
     <lb/> Charlie<ref target="n1" n="1">[1]</ref>. what part wil Ireland <unclear/> if England
     <unclear/> against us, There seems to be a <lb/> backwardness on the parts of Ireland about
     migrating to the U. S, and it is strong by <unclear>suspected[?]</unclear>
     <lb/> that the English authorities are using <unclear>[their]</unclear>
     <lb/> to prevent it. Does England <unclear>[believe]</unclear> she will need <lb/> all of her
     fighting men herself? I do not think all <lb/> of Ireland will for-get the debt of gratitude
     she <lb/>
     <del hand="h1">far</del> woes to <del hand="h1">ing</del> the U.S. as to engage with her
      <unclear>[now?]</unclear>
     <lb/> war. She certainly hates England as her oppression <lb/> and loves the stars and stripes
     as her <unclear/>
     <lb/> I recieved a letter from sister Laurie <lb/> a few days ago she was well but had not
     <lb/> heard from you yet. But my scholars <lb/> are coming and I must close. Write often <lb/>
     very often dearest Charlie, to your <lb/> affectionate and true <lb/>
    </p>
