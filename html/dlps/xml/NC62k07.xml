                        Case</title>

                <p> Charley describes the Brigade's march to Harper's Ferry, and says he may well be
                    there for the winter in the enviable position of Clerk to the Provost Marshal.
                    He hopes to take a furlough during the winter to visit Addie, but realizes it
                    may be impossible. He responds to Addie's letter in which she describes an
                    affair between her sister, Laura, and Mr. Grant. Charley is astounded at Mr.
                    Grant's "low" and "vile" behavior, and believes God will "mete out justice to
                    such men". Charley wishes happiness to Laura in her new "estate" as Mrs.
                    Thompson. Charley also expresses regret that Hal was not successful in "filling
                    up the 84th" but imagines that Addie will be pleased because this means Hal will
                    not return to the field. </p>

                <p> Quite a long time has elapsed since<lb/> I last wrote you, and I fear you will

                    explain this unwanted silence, I think you will<lb/> forgive me &mdash; at
                    least in part. Two precious letters<lb/> have been recieved from you, each of
                    which deserves an<lb/> "answer" complete in itself, b<del hand="h1">y</del><add

                    interesting letter.<lb/>
                </p>

                <p> You percieve by the "heading" that I am in the<lb/> Provost Marshal's office at
                    this place, where I have been<lb/> since Sunday, &mdash; in the pleasant

                    Clerk.<lb/>

                <p> The <abbr expan="Regiment">Regt</abbr> &mdash; in fact the Brigade was
                    aroused<lb/> from our pleasant camp in <name type="place">Loudon Valley</name> on
                    Thursday<lb/> morning to "move with Camp and Garrison equipage, at<lb/> 6 A.M."
                    and at that time we were in line and even<lb/> marching toward <name type="place"
                        >Harper's Ferry</name>, through which we <orig reg="passed"
                    >pa&longs;sed</orig><lb/> to <name type="place">Bolivar Heights</name>, where
                    we halted for further orders.<lb/>
                </p>

                <p> The result was &mdash; we had to go out on Picket duty<lb/> leaving a few
                    men to pitch our camp at <name type="place">Bolivar Heights</name>.<lb/>
                    <pb n="2" entity="DSSR_000000766_0656"/> We were not <orig reg="relieved"
                    >relived</orig> until late Friday night and then<lb/> was obliged to walk
                    4&frac12; miles to attain a point only &frac34; mile<lb/> away. This was
                    to gratify a "stylish Colonel." Saturday and<lb/> Sunday I was quite unwell, but
                    Sunday P.M. I was detailed<lb/> for this duty, and in view of the coming cold
                    weather and<lb/>
                    <orig reg="cheerless">cheerle&longs;s</orig> camps, I thought I would come.
                    The work &mdash; though<lb/> steady &mdash; is not very heavy and with
                    our present Provost Marshal<lb/> &mdash; <name type="person"><abbr

                    shall come home this Winter. By the way, old Boreas has<lb/> made his appearance
                    with us, and left &mdash; no, not left, for he hasn't<lb/> gone &mdash;
                    but is making his footsteps plainly visible. It has snowed<lb/> continually all
                    day, and the surrounding hills are quite<lb/> enshrouded in a snowy mantle
                    &mdash; (There &mdash; think of being<lb/>

                </p>

                <p> Of course, you have heard of the "Advance", and<lb/> of course are anxious to
                    learn if the Seventh is "with the<lb/> army". For a wonder, we &mdash; <hi
                        rend="underline">our entire Corps</hi> &mdash; are in the<lb/> rear,
                    actually remaining to garrison this famous "City of Burnt<lb/> Shops", and the
                    surrounding Heights!!! </p>

                <pb n="3" entity="DSSR_000000766_0657"/>

                <p> From all I can learn, we will <orig reg="doubtlessly"
                    >doubtle&longs;sly</orig> remain here this<lb/> coming Winter, and nothing
                    could be more acceptable to us<lb/> as a regiment. </p>

                <p> Now I will briefly reply to a<lb/> portion of your letters &mdash; but do
                    not think, my darling <name type="person" reg="Adelaide E. Case">Addie</name>
                    that<lb/> I wish to neglect them, nothing is farther from my thoughts
                    &mdash; I will<lb/> write a good long letter soon, and devote "lots" of time
                    and care to it<lb/> The office is crowded now, and it is quite late in the
                    evening.<lb/>
