            <salute>Dear Paul:
            </salute></opener>
        		
        		<p>
            A lot of very
            severe fighting during
            the last few days
            has resulted in a great
            deal of work for us
            and hence no time to
            write.
        		</p>
        		<p>
            There isn’t much
            news anyway, save
            that regarding operations
            and we naturally can’t
            write along that line.
        		</p>
        		<p>
            I was very much
            pleased the other day
                        
            <pb n="[p.2]"/>
            
            to have a Mr. Terry (I
            don’t know the French
            spelling of his name)
            tell me that he had
            heard from the Vicomte
            du Peloux and that
            he had asked him to 
            tell me you had been
            given a very long
            leave.  I’m “sure” pleased
            to hear it, tho [sic] I’d 
            rather you had been
            made reforme, of
            course.  It was
            exceptionally nice and
                        
            <pb n="[p.3]"/>
            
            thoughtful of the 
            Vicomte to get the
            news out to me.
            In your letter, which
            I received the day
            before, you stated
            you were going before
            the Commission
            the next day.
        		</p>
        		<p>
            Mr. Terry is a
            charming man to 
            talk with.  I believe
            he’s been in diplomatic
            work.  He speaks
            English perfectly.
        		</p>
        		<p>
            
            <pb n="[p.4]"/>
            
            We’re now living all
            the time at our
            advance point for
            the work has become
            so heavy that we
            all of us have to be
            on the job night and 
            day.  I told you, didn’t
            I, that the French
            section had been
            ordered away to another
            point and that now
            we do all the work.
            We are to have six
            new cars and as
            many drivers by next
                        
            <pb n="[p.5]"/>
            
            Wednesday.
        		</p>
        		<p>
            The Germans are 
            paying us a bit
            more attention now
            and certain people
            are getting out.  There
            was a shop where
            very delicious Madelines
            could be obtained.  A
            shell hit the place
            the other day and now
            we can buy no Madelines.
            We had electric lights,
            but an obus clipped
            our wires and now we
            have but gas.
                        
            <pb n="[p.6]"/>
            
            It certainly is a
            gay old time after a
            charge, isn’t it?  Up
            at the Postes de Secours
            where the soldiers have
            come down for a little
            while to rest the
            scene is certainly a 
            queer one, and there
            is a moving quality 
            to the atmosphere that
            does not usually exist.
            I saw one fellow,
            the blood streaming
            down his face from
            a head wound, wearing
                        
            <pb n="[p.7]"/>
            
            a captured German
            helmet tacking up
            and down the road
            soused to the gills.
            The great mob of
            soldiers all around
            are raising a great
            lot of noise, yelling
            at anything and
            there isn’t a thing
            they wouldn’t do 
            for you.  He’s a 
            great fellow, the
            French soldier; so
                        
            <pb n="[p.8]"/>
            
            full of different sentiments.
            The other morning at
            sunrise a dying man 
            was given me.  His
            comrades gathered around
            my car and said “Bon
            voyage mon vieux et bonne
            chance.”  And their voices
            were soft, for they saw
            death coming into his face.
            When I arrived at the
            hospital I found that
            the soldiers had stuck
            sprigs of lilac around 
            my car.
