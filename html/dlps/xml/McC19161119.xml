            <salute>Dear Paul:</salute>
        		</opener>
        		
        		<p>            
            Thanks for your letter &mdash; am
            glad to get the news.
            </p><p>
            Yes I told the boys about
            your wedding as I had to talk of
            the leave I wanted to see the affair.
            </p><p>
            The Boches came over the other
            night and dropped bombs all over us.  One
            hitting the tank of a machine set fire 
            to it and 8 planes went up.  All
            to gether 16 were destroyed.  One fellow
            burnt to death and 9 wounded.  “Skip”
            tried his first night flight and
            landed down near the sea.  He’s still
            there on account of the weather.
            </p><p>
            Yes Bert Hall is at our field.
            There are 8 escadrilles de chasse here.
            He’s in N. 103 and cleaning up on foker.
            Luff went to Paris to get a <unclear>Spad. [sp?]</unclear>
            </p><p>
            The lines here are hard to
            pick out and at 4,000 its cold as
            the devil &mdash; gets my back for fair.
            Rumsey is going to Paris to get 
            cured of boils.
            </p><p>
            Hill says he’ll write soon and
            to thank you for letter.  He sends
            
            <pb n="[p.2]"/>
            
            best to you &amp; Mrs. Weeks.  Rumsey
            says he called but no one was
            home.
            </p><p>
            Went over to dine with some British
            officers last night and as a result
            “Havi” and I are glad there’s no
            flying today.  I have Luff’s old
            machine.
            </p><p>
            I am afraid I can’t do the work
            for Page out here.  Its so cold that
            a short letter is about one’s limit.
            </p><p>
            Haven’t heard from Helene or Marcelle
            as yet.  Strikes me as peculiar &mdash; 
            considering.
            </p>
        		
        		<closer>
            <salute>Well, old boy let me hear from
            you often.  Love to Mrs. Weeks.</salute>
