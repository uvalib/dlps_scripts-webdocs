            <p>
            Your welcome letter
            was received this noon.  I am
            terribly sorry to hear your
            ankle has gone back on you.
            You ought to rest until its
            quite well.  Maybe those
            refreshing walks set it back.
            </p><p>
            I have but little
            time left on the Nieuport
            but when finished I do not
            know what I shall do.  I
            hope to be called to the
            front but reports aren’t very
            encouraging.  The bunch that
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0268" n="[p.2]"/>
            
            left here not so long ago were
            supposed to go directly to the
            front.  They write that they
            are tied up at Plaissey &mdash; Belleville.
            They are considered ready for
            the front and will only be
            held two months, so they write,
            and go on to say that if they
            had not been perfectioned at Pau
            but sent to P.B for same
            they would have been held
            six months.  Cheerful prospect
            isn’t it?  I am told that
            I will be ready inside of
            two weeks.  I wrote to Watt [or Walt]
            asking him to have me sent
            to Toul.  He’s leaving for
            Australian flying corps.  D<hi rend="underline">____</hi>!
            My friend Le Bourbis has been
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0269" n="[p.3]"/>
            
            wounded.  The Chef pilote that
            was here when I arrived and
            who told us good by a
            couple of weeks ago was shot
            in the leg above the lines and
            has lost his left limb.  Poor
            chap he was a fine fellow.
            There are peculiar accidents here.
            The other day a fellow fainted
            at 2,000 meters and his
            machine fell that distance,
            and on its back.  They say
            the pilot has almost recovered.
            The same day one came down
            from only 100 meters and was
            killed on the spot.
            </p><p>
            Since starting this
            letter I have been over to
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0270" n="[p.4]"/>
            
            the Boche camp just across
            the road.  Sundays they clean
            up and then there is a review.
            They passed the French officer
            with the goose step.  Their arms
            are rigid at their side, the head
            faces the officer and the straight
            legs work like levers.  The feet
            pounding on the road make the
            very ground tremble.  At first
            I was impressed, then amused,
            and then I was shocked that
            a system could turn men
            into such a machine depriving
            them of all human character;
            finally I pitied the poor brutes
            because they had to become
            machines.
            </p><p>
            I am sitting in a 
            hanger, using as a support
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0271" n="[p.5]"/>
            
            for the letter a sugar box.
            Its the only time I have<unclear>[.]</unclear>
            </p><p>
            The reason I sent
            letters to the S.S. was
            because I fear your father
            and mother do not want
            you to receive letters from
            me.  By the way did
            you get the photos I
            sent you?
            x   x   x
            Later.
            </p><p>
            Nearly polished myself
            off a few minutes ago.  We 
            started to fly and I went
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0273" n="[p.6]"/>
            
            out.  Coming back I
            started a spiral at 1,000
            meters and thinking about
            my lean I didn’t pay much 
            attention to my angle of
            descent.  First thing I knew
            I’d flopped from the side to
            a vertical dive.  I figured 
            my controls were just reversed
            then as I had been told.  The
            rudder would point me up
            and down and the marche a
            <unclear>falai [sp?]</unclear> to right or left.  I
            worked out of it but the
            fellows told me they thought
            the fusilage [sic] would snap
            when I straightened and   
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0272" n="[p.7]"/>
            
            had figured me out as
            dead.  The Nieuforts are very
            strong tho [sic] and one can
            do all sorts of things with
            them.
            </p><p>
            Tell me one thing.  If
            I get any time off when
            I pass thru [sic] Paris may
            I see you?  I will go
            to hospital or any place
            you say.  There was a
            chance to day to go to
            Paris Guard.  No one would
            take the job.  Lots were
            drawn and three are billed
            for that fool work.
            </p><p>
            My friend Haviland is
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0274" n="[p.8]"/>
            
            doing remarkably well.
            He’ll be breveted in a week
            and I hope sent to Nieuport
            with me.  There are no
            more brevet permissions.
            Wish I hadn’t been given one.
