     <p>A PROMINENT BOOKSELLER," REPORTED AN English book trade journal at the end of the last
      century, "lately affirmed that the dead are today taking the bread out of the mouths of the
      living at a rate unparalleled in the history of literature. Even the popular novelist, he
      said, feels the competition of those who 'rule our spirits from their urn.'"<ref
       target="f011.01.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref></p>


     <p>Not that Marie Corelli, Hall Caine, Rider Haggard, and the other best-selling writers of the
      1890's were in any danger of starvation. Financially speaking, the profession of authorship
      had never before been as rewarding. But it was also true that the flood of reprinted classics,
      which had been steadily mounting for several decades, had reached a new peak. The full history
      of this important branch of Victorian publishing, a task writer a leader-writer in the <hi
       rend="italic">Times Literary Supplement</hi> a decade ago urged some "industrious
      bibliographer" to undertake,<ref target="f011.01.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref> will
      not be attempted here. Instead, we shall be concerned mainly with two aspects of cheap-reprint
      publishing: its relation to the contemporary social and cultural background, and the way in
      which it illustrates in microcosm some of the theories and practices of the Victorian book
      trade generally.</p>


     <p>From one viewpoint, Victorian England was not a very fertile ground on which to sow reprints
      of the national classics. In some educated quarters, the work of English writers was still
      looked upon, as it had been in Elizabethan times, as a second-class literature. This <pb
       n="011.004"/> attitude is implied in a letter Sir Alexander Grant wrote from Bombay to F. T.
      Palgrave in 1862, discussing the possibility of adopting Palgrave's <hi rend="italic">Golden
       Treasury</hi> as a classbook for Indian students: "I hope you won't think this a degradation.
      English poetry is to these people what Homer is to us."<ref target="f011.01.03" n="3"><hi
        rend="super">3</hi></ref> Down almost to the end of the century, the old universities were
      officially unaware of English literature as a subject for serious study. Again, their lofty or
      complex style, their far-ranging allusiveness, and the sophistication of their thought placed
      many English classics beyond the grasp of readers with limited education. The mass audience of
      Victorian times was ill-equipped to understand, let alone find pleasure in, books that had
      been addressed to the intellectual &eacute;lite of preceding centuries. In that era, as in any
      other, it was contemporary writers, speaking their audience's own language, and reflecting
      their audience's own preoccupations, who had the greatest appeal. Finally, the
      anti-imaginative bias of evangelicalism and utilitarianism was everywhere felt, especially in
      the first half of the century. Reading belles lettres, it was alleged, was both sinful and
      wasteful of time that could be put to far better advantage in "practical" pursuits.</p>


     <p>But even more numerous and stronger counter-forces were at work. One was a backwash of
      romanticism: the growing charm of the antique, exemplified in the bibliophily of men like
      Lamb, Hunt, and the elder Disraeli. The sense that books, and particularly old ones, have a
      magical glamor spread as the high place of imaginative and emotional experience in men's lives
      was reaffirmed. Closely associated with this reaction against rationalism and gritty
      utilitarianism was the increased importance literature acquired as a social institution. As
      Lionel Trilling has pointed out, literature "came to be the medium and the repository of the
      ethical values and the feelings that had once been peculiar to religion. And literature became
      even more. Carlyle, under the influence of Goethe, formulated the notion of the Man of Letters
      not only as a priest but as a hero and a seer and thus made him co-equal with the political
      leader and the rival of the scientist. In short, literature took upon itself the very greatest
      responsibilities and arrogated to itself the most effective powers."<ref target="f011.01.04"
       n="4"><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref></p>


     <p>Furthermore, as democracy slowly spread, the age-old notion that literature was the concern
      only of the cultural and social aristocracy faded. As early as 1819, Francis Jeffrey announced
      that "the fame of a poet is popular, or nothing. He does not address himself, like the man of
      science, to the learned, or those who desire to learn, but to all mankind; <pb n="011.005"/>
      and his purpose being to delight and be praised, necessarily extends to all who can receive
      pleasure, or join in applause."<ref target="f011.01.05" n="5"><hi rend="super">5</hi></ref>
      Literature of both the past and the present gradually came to be looked upon as part of the
      cultural heritage of all the people.</p>


     <p>As the limitations of the utilitarian philosophy became more apparent, the Victorians became
      uncomfortably aware that in their society humanistic values had been more and more neglected;
      and in an attempt to redress the balance, their journalists and public men joined to praise
      books as the great medium of cultural enrichment. The countless essays and speeches they
      composed on "The Blessedness of Books," "Little Books with Large Aims," "What a Single Book
      May Do for a Youth," and similar topics were part of a continuous campaign to encourage the
      habit of serious, profitable reading among the multitude. With opportunities for formal
      education severely limited, the idea of self-help was part of the Victorian creed; hence books
      were revered as fireside universities. Polite literature was prized not so much for its
      capacity to give pleasure as for its extra-literary, or non-aesthetic, values. It was through
      reading masterpieces of literature that the student could, for instance, enhance his
      understanding of history. Such an approach was used by F. D. Maurice in his lectures on
      English literature at King's College in the forties,<ref target="f011.01.06" n="6"><hi
        rend="super">6</hi></ref> and by the author of the articles on literature in Cassell's
      influential <hi rend="italic">Popular Educator</hi>.</p>


     <p>These were some of the reasons why non-contemporary English literature was constantly
      brought to the attention of ordinary readers, through excerpts and appreciative comment, in
      the pages of early mass-circulation periodicals like the <hi rend="italic">Penny Magazine</hi>
      and <hi rend="italic">Chambers's Journal</hi>. Indeed, all the way down to the era of George
      Newnes's <hi rend="italic">Tit-Bits</hi>, some of the most popular cheap weeklies
      unapologetically used extracts from classic English literature as fillers. Middle-class
      newspapers gave generous space to reviews of current books and other literary topics.
      Literature was a favorite subject for the mechanics' institute lectures which had so prominent
      a part in middle-class cultural life in early-and mid-Victorian England. And, with the
      adoption of Mundella's code in 1883, elementary schools began to require pupils in the upper
      standards to read, parse, and memorize selected English classics. Full-length works, or
      substantial parts thereof, replaced the old "beauties" anthologies which for many decades had
      represented virtually the only chance children had to gain a glimpse of the standard classics,
      at least in the schoolroom.</p>

     <pb n="011.006"/>

     <p>This, in brief, was the background against which the rise of the cheap classic reprint
      series took place. Historically, the first important inexpensive reprints, made possible by
      the momentous decision in Donaldson <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Beckett (1774), which killed the
      legal fiction of perpetual copyright, were those of John Bell, John Cooke, and James Harrison,
      each of whom produced two or more series devoted to out-of-copyright poets, prose writers, and
      dramatists. The delight they brought to impecunious book-lovers in the last quarter of the
      eighteenth century and the early years of the nineteenth was celebrated by Leigh Hunt,
      Hazlitt, Henry Kirke White, and William Hone, among others. Of Cooke in particular, Augustine
      Birrell wrote a century later: "You never see on a stall one of Cooke's books but it is soiled
      by honest usage, its odour . . . speaks of the thousand thumbs that have turned over its pages
      with delight. . . . He believed both in genius and his country. He gave people cheap books,
      and they bought them gladly."<ref target="f011.01.07" n="7"><hi rend="super">7</hi></ref></p>


     <p>Between 1790 and 1830 there was a scattering of relatively cheap series, appealing to a
      class of readers who could not afford the better-remembered, but higher-priced, collections of
      Alexander Chalmers (English Poets and British Essayists), Robert Anderson (British Poets),
      Robert Lynam (British Essayists), Mrs. Inchbald (British Theatre), Mrs. Barbauld (British
      Novelists), and Sir Walter Scott (Ballantyne's Novelist's Library). The bookseller John Sharpe
      brought out a long series of English poets, another of the eighteenth-century essayists, and a
      third of the dramatists. John Fowler Dove's miniature (24mo.) reprints of the English
      classics, ranging from <hi rend="italic">The Compleat Angler</hi> to Pope's <hi rend="italic"
       >Poetical Works</hi>, ran to well over 100 titles. The Chiswick printer Charles Whittingham,
      producer of a typographically distinguished 100-volume set of the British poets for the
      carriage trade, served the humbler public with his Cabinet Library and Novelists Library (or,
      as it was also called, Whittingham's Pocket Novelists). The price range of all these series
      was rather wide&mdash;in the case of Whittingham's, from 2<hi rend="italic">s.</hi> to 4<hi
       rend="italic">s.</hi> 6<hi rend="italic">d.</hi> per volume. The cheapest series of all
      during this period seems to have been that of John Limbird, publisher of the 2<hi
       rend="italic">d.</hi> weekly <hi rend="italic">Mirror of Literature</hi>, who brought out a
      series of British novels, with prices running from 6<hi rend="italic">d.</hi> to 3<hi
       rend="italic">s.</hi> 6<hi rend="italic">d.</hi>, and another of miscellaneous British
      classics, from 8<hi rend="italic">d.</hi> a volume upward. In addition to reprints dignified
      by a series title, individual cheap editions of classic authors were also issued by various
      publishers, nearly all of whom were despised by the genteel firms of Paternoster Row.
      Conspicuous among them was Thomas Tegg, the energetic scavenger of <pb n="011.007"/>
      remainders and expired copyrights, whose products were memorable for their low prices, miserly
      format, and slovenly, not to say slashed, texts.</p>

     <p>The period 1827-32 saw the first important burst of interest in cheap books among
      "respectable" publishers. The appearance of Constable's Miscellany, the Society for the
      Diffusion of Useful Knowledge's twin Libraries of Useful and Entertaining Knowledge, Murray's
      Family Library, Cadell's reissue of Scott's novels at 5<hi rend="italic">s.</hi>, and Colburn
      and Bentley's Standard Novels touched off a virtual mania in the trade. No firm was without at
      least one hastily contrived "library" in its bid for the shillings of the suddenly-discovered
      mass reading public, whose size was now as much exaggerated as it had previously been
      underestimated. Cheap reprints of literary classics inevitably figured in the boom. In 1830
      appeared the first volumes of the Aldine Edition of the British Poets, the result of the
      collaboration of the bookseller William Pickering and the printer Charles Whittingham. The
      most memorable classic-reprint series of the period, it held an honorable place in an
      increasingly competitive field down into the present century. For these reasons, it is
      convenient and fitting to settle upon the year 1830 as the beginning of the era when
      publishers developed cheap classic libraries as an integral&mdash;not merely
      incidental&mdash;part of their lists.</p>

    </div2>

    <div2 id="vol011.01.02" type="section" n="2">
     <head/>
     <p>The two following sections of this article are based upon a list I have compiled, from all
      available sources, of cheap reprint series of English classics from 1830 to 1906. At the
      outset, the criteria of eligibility I have used should be made clear: (1) No hard-and-fast
      test of "cheapness" has been adopted; but series designed chiefly for the specialist or
      scholar (such as the Fuller Worthies Library and W. E. Henley's Tudor Translations), or
      published at a price that was clearly beyond the reach of any but the well-to-do, have been
      omitted. (2) What is a "classic"? Since value judgments are irrelevant to our present
      purposes, perhaps the best definition is the one implied in the statement, attributed to the
      publisher Stanley Unwin, that "it takes two generations to make a classic."<ref
       target="f011.01.08" n="8"><hi rend="super">8</hi></ref> Obviously some books become
      established classics even within the lifetime of their authors, as did the novels of Scott and
      Dickens and the poetry of Byron and Tennyson, so that the demarcation between classics and
      recent books of evidently lasting popularity is vague indeed. But since a line must be drawn
      somewhere, series composed mainly of nineteenth-century titles have <pb n="011.008"/> been
      excluded, except for series late in the century, by which time works surviving from the
      generation of Wordsworth, Shelley, and Lamb had achieved, by any definition, the status of
      classic. (3) Series expressly designed for schoolroom use have been excluded. (4) Series which
      were virtually abortive, running to only a few titles and then vanishing, have also been
      omitted.</p>

     <p>The remarkable thing is that even with these severe restrictions, the list of cheap classic
      reprint series for the period 1830-1906 runs to between ninety and one hundred. Even if we
      make liberal allowance for series which appear more than once, under different names&mdash;for
      the bibliographer, a source of exasperation which will be commented on in a little
      while&mdash;the number would in any event exceed seventy-five: an average of one new classic
      reprint series for every year in the period covered.</p>

     <p>Some of the main cultural reasons for the proliferation of cheap classics after 1830 have
      already been mentioned. In addition, a powerful economic factor encouraged publishers to
      launch such series: the simple circumstance that most standard classics are in the public
      domain and therefore are cheaper to reprint than works still in copyright. As the literacy
      rate increased and the reading habit became more widespread, the demand for cheap books grew.
      For various reasons, among them the tyranny of the circulating-library system and the higher
      prices authors were getting for their work, books by contemporary writers were expensive and,
      despite the developing practice of issuing 6<hi rend="italic">s.</hi> reprints of successful
      works some time after first publication, they remained so until the 1890's. Thus the hunger
      for cheap reading matter was met, in part, by printing non-copyright works. In 1894 Augustine
      Birrell observed that "you may buy twenty books by dead men at the price of one work by a
      living man."<ref target="f011.01.09" n="9"><hi rend="super">9</hi></ref></p>

     <p>The prices charged for volumes by "dead men" more or less followed the broad tendencies in
      the publishing trade as a whole. Technological improvements&mdash;the use of steam-driven
      presses; the cheapening of paper by the introduction of paper-making machines, the
      substitution of esparto and chemical woodpulp for expensive rags, and the reduction and
      eventual repeal of the paper tax; the invention of machine-made casings to replace hand-sewed
      bindings&mdash;made the production of cheap books more and more rewarding. The low profit per
      copy was compensated for by the enlarged quantity sold.</p>

     <p>Down into the fifties and sixties, the usual price of a classic reprint was between 3<hi
       rend="italic">s</hi>.6<hi rend="italic">d.</hi> and 5<hi rend="italic">s.</hi>. The lower
      figure was that charged, for instance, for a volume in Bohn's Standard Library and British
      Classics <pb n="011.009"/> (series begun in 1846 and 1853 respectively); the higher was the
      price of most of the other Bohn libraries, which in the aggregate comprised one of the
      century's two or three most famous reprint lists. Into this price range fell also the other
      leading series of the period&mdash;Routledge's British Poets, Bell and Daldy's reissue of the
      old Aldine Poets, Warne's Popular Poets and Chandos Library, Nelson's Illustrated Series of
      the Poets, Nimmo's Cheap Edition of the Poets, and Macmillan's Globe Library. But already,
      because the 3<hi rend="italic">s.</hi>6<hi rend="italic">d.</hi> price for non-copyright
      reprints compared unfavorably with the shilling or two charged for "railway library" reprints
      of copyright works, certain firms experimented with lower prices. The highly diversified
      Cottage Library of Milner and Sowerby, a firm originally of Halifax but later of Paternoster
      Row, sold for a shilling a volume. Robert Bell's Annotated Series of the English Poets came
      out at 2<hi rend="italic">s.</hi>6<hi rend="italic">d.</hi> in 1854-57 and was reissued in
      1864 in monthly volumes, 1<hi rend="italic">s.</hi> in paper and 1<hi rend="italic"
       >s.</hi>6<hi rend="italic">d.</hi> in cloth. In the sixties Griffin's Universal Library and
      Warne's Chandos Classics sold at 2<hi rend="italic">s.</hi> or less.</p>

     <p>This trend toward lower prices was hastened by two spectacular free-for-alls in the reprint
      trade. One was occasioned by the Waverley novels, the "Author's Edition" of which, issued in
      1829, had initiated the 5<hi rend="italic">s.</hi> or 6<hi rend="italic">s.</hi> copyright
      reprint. Cadell's "People's Edition," issued in weekly numbers (i.e., parts of volumes) in
      1844, sold over 7,000,000 numbers of the novels alone, and 674,000 of the poems. After
      Cadell's death in 1849, his Scott copyrights were bought by the firm of A. and C. Black, who
      felt that there still was life left in the fabulous old property. For the "Railway Edition" in
      1858-60 the price per volume was reduced to 1<hi rend="italic">s.</hi>6<hi rend="italic"
       >d.</hi>, and in 1862-63 it was further cut, to a straight shilling. At this point the novels
      began to fall out of copyright, and other firms scrambled to pick them up. One publisher, John
      Camden Hotten, brought out 6<hi rend="italic">d.</hi> monthly volumes, each containing a
      complete novel. Black responded with a competitively priced series, which had the extra
      attraction of Scott's own revisions and notes&mdash;material that was still in copyright. But
      within a few years (1873) even this sensationally low price was halved when John Dicks, a
      reprint publisher whose activities deserve more study than the extant records permit, brought
      out complete Waverley novels at 3<hi rend="italic">d.</hi><ref target="f011.01.10" n="10"><hi rend="super">10</hi></ref></p>


     <p>There was also the episode of the shilling Shakespeares. In 1864, the year of the poet's
      tercentenary, John Dicks brought out the plays at two for a penny, and sold about 150,000
      copies. Collecting them into a 2<hi rend="italic">s.</hi> cloth-bound volume, he sold 50,000
      more. Then, hearing that Hotten was planning a complete Shakespeare to sell at 1<hi
       rend="italic">s.</hi>, Dicks cut <pb n="011.010"/> the price of his own edition in half,
      substituting wrappers for cloth, and sold 700,000 copies in the next three or four years. For
      his shilling the Shakespeare lover got 1,020 pages of closely packed text and thirty-seven
      woodcuts. In 1868 both Routledge and Warne issued editions at the same price.<ref
       target="f011.01.11" n="11"><hi rend="super">11</hi></ref></p>

     <p>In the seventies, the increased demand created by the schools, further economies in
      production, and, we may suppose, the example of the irrepressible Dicks, who had followed up
      his shilling Shakespeare with a 473-page illustrated Byron at 7<hi rend="italic">d.</hi>, a
      Thomson at 6<hi rend="italic">d.</hi>, and about a dozen other classic authors at similar
      reductions, pushed prices down still further. The Aldine Poets were reissued at 1<hi
       rend="italic">s.</hi>6<hi rend="italic">d.</hi>, and in response Bell's Annotated Edition was
      cut to 1<hi rend="italic">s.</hi>3<hi rend="italic">d.</hi> Later in the decade the Moxon
      Library Poets, originally priced at 5<hi rend="italic">s.</hi>, were taken over by Ward, Lock
      and Co., and, renamed the Standard Poets, sold at 1<hi rend="italic">s.</hi>6<hi rend="italic"
       >d.</hi> in paper and 2<hi rend="italic">s.</hi> in cloth.</p>

     <p>In the eighties, houses like Routledge and Cassell, by then the titans of the reprint trade,
      waged an all-out price war. Routledge's Universal Library, edited by Henry Morley, began in
      1883 at a shilling a volume. Two years later Cassell hired Morley to edit the firm's new
      National Library, issued weekly at 3<hi rend="italic">d.</hi> in paper and 6<hi rend="italic"
       >d.</hi> in cloth. This proved the most popular classic series yet produced, and in quick
      retaliation Routledge brought out their World Library at the same price. The bitterness of the
      rivalry between these houses can be judged from a squabble they conducted in the
      correspondence columns of the London <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> for March 20, 22, and 23,
      1886. Cassell vigorously objected to Routledge's issuing, in their World Library, the same
      titles that had been announced for Cassell's National Library; Routledge retorted that they
      had been forced to do so by similar "illegitimate competition" on the part of Cassell. Morley
      managed to smooth the ruffled feathers of both his employers, but among other questions left
      unanswered was that of the ethics involved in an editor's managing two rival series at once.<ref target="f011.01.12" n="12"><hi rend="super">12</hi></ref></p>


     <pb n="011.011"/>

     <p>The gradual but steady reduction in price during the second half of the century is
      exemplified by the fact that Sampson Low's Choice Editions of Choice Books, originally
      published in the late 1850's at 5<hi rend="italic">s.</hi> a volume, were reprinted in the
      seventies at 2<hi rend="italic">s.</hi>6<hi rend="italic">d.</hi>, and again in the nineties
      at 1<hi rend="italic">s.</hi> (There was also a progressive shrinkage in size, from "small
      quarto" to "small octavo" to "royal 16mo.") By the end of the century, one or two shillings or
      a half-crown was the standard price for a full-length pocket classic bound in cloth. The
      enterprising W. T. Stead, to be sure, undercut even the 3<hi rend="italic">d.</hi> National
      and World Libraries with his Masterpiece Library (1895), composed of weekly leaflets in two
      series, the Penny Novelists and Penny Poets. But this venture, though initially successful,
      was short-lived and set no precedent.</p>

     <p>Our modern era of cheap-reprint publishing may be dated from 1906, the year with which the
      present study ends. It was then that J. M. Dent, who had gained experience as the publisher of
      the Temple Shakespeare, the Temple Dramatists, and the Temple Classics, fulfilled a
      long-standing ambition by issuing Everyman's Library at 1<hi rend="italic">s.</hi> a volume:
      not one title at a time, but fifty. The frenzied editorial and production activity and
      financial maneuvering necessary to issue a classic library on so grandiose a scale&mdash;a
      "small army" of "British Museum foragers" and introduction-writers was employed, extended
      credit was wheedled from papermakers&mdash;is a vividly recorded episode in British book trade
       history.<ref target="f011.01.13" n="13"><hi rend="super">13</hi></ref> But the larger
      significance of the Everyman series (and in this connection, the World's Classics, begun a few
      years earlier by Grant Richards but soon transferred to Henry Frowde, must also receive
      honorable mention) is twofold: it reintroduced into reprint publishing the concern for
      attractive format which had been largely neglected since the days of Whittingham and the
      Chiswick Press, and it boldly departed from the conventionalized lists of classics, reprinting
      for the first time scores upon scores of good books which had never before been available in
      inexpensive editions.</p>

    </div2>

    <div2 id="vol011.01.03" type="section" n="3">
     <head/>
     <p>The practices adopted in producing and marketing the cheap classic series often throw
      interesting light upon contemporary publishing theory and book-buying habits. The "library"
      idea&mdash;selling a frequently miscellaneous list of books under a generic
      title&mdash;reflects three familiar merchandising premises, now known as "package psychology,"
       <pb n="011.012"/> "brand name psychology," and "snob appeal" respectively. The first assumes
      that when a buyer owns a few volumes in a given series (the "package"), he is likely to want
      to acquire the rest. The second assumes that a reader who is already pleased with one or two
      books belonging to such-and-such a "library" will regard the name of that series as a
      guarantee of excellence. The third depends on the connotation of "library," a term which in
      the nineteenth century was frequently preceded by "gentleman's." Possession of a shelf or two
      of books prominently labeled "library" gave a man a pleasant feeling of added status, however
      humble his actual circumstances.</p>

     <p>Closely associated with the series concept&mdash;they developed side by side in the
      eighteenth century&mdash;is the practice of publishing a book in instalments. From the
      publisher's standpoint, number- or part-issue not only has the advantages just attributed to
      the series but in addition, by spreading the book's cost to the purchaser over a period of
      time, makes it seem lower than it actually is. Many classic reprint series during the first
      two-thirds of the century&mdash;Cassell's various illustrated editions of literary
      masterpieces offer examples from the 1860's&mdash;were initially issued in weekly or monthly
      numbers at a few pennies each, with the completed volume becoming available immediately upon
      the end of the part-issue. This, of course, was exactly the procedure followed in the case of
      well-known Victorian novelists, from <hi rend="italic">The Pickwick Papers</hi> on into the
      early seventies.</p>

     <p>Frequently, too, the principle of publishing at stated intervals was applied to complete
      volumes, without the preliminary step of issuing in several separate numbers. Thus book
      publishers exploited the habit of regular purchase which became increasingly prevalent as
      cheap periodicals won the allegiance of the mass public. If a reader was used to buying a
      favorite paper each Saturday, why should he not acquire the custom of buying the latest issue
      in a certain reprint series at the same time? This was the reasoning behind the weekly or
      monthly issue of series like Walter Scott's Camelot Classics and Canterbury Poets, Routledge's
      Universal Library, and Cassell's National Library. Like the yellow-backs that had won immense
      popularity a generation earlier, the classic reprint series of the nineties, priced at 3<hi
       rend="italic">d.</hi>, and 1<hi rend="italic">s.</hi>, used the newsagents' stalls to reach a
      large public that never ventured inside a regular bookshop. Then as now (at least in certain
      outlets) classic reprints were displayed alongside soft-bound copyright reprints and
      mass-circulation weeklies.</p>

     <p>In their anxiety to squeeze every possible farthing of profit from the plates and sheets of
      their classic titles, publishers used almost every conceivable merchandising device.
      Frequently an old series whose component <pb n="011.013"/> titles had not originally appeared
      at regular intervals&mdash;the Aldine Poets, Bell's English Poets, and Kent's (later
      Cassell's) Miniature Library of Poets are cases in point&mdash;was reissued in periodic
      volumes, fortnightly or monthly. Sometimes, as was true of Moxon's Old Dramatists, a series
      previously issued in complete volumes was reintroduced in numbers. Almost every successful
      series was reissued, sometimes more than once, in cheaper format. Occasionally the process was
      reversed, and a cheap series (for instance, Bell and Daldy's Pocket Volumes) was transmuted
      into a more expensive one (the Elzevir Series) "so as to be more suitable for Presents and
      School Prizes."<ref target="f011.01.14" n="14"><hi rend="super">14</hi></ref></p>



     <p>Some series had relatively brief lives, at least in the catalogues of their original
      publishers. They strutted their brief moment on the stage, heralded by blaring publicity, and
      then were heard no more. In 1866, for example, Frederick Warne proclaimed the debut of the
      Clydesdale Classics, "Marvels of Standard Cheap Literature, without a parallel as yet in
      English Publishing"; their first number, a <hi rend="italic">Pilgrim's Progress</hi>, offered
      eighty pages of original colored designs, new type, and fine paper&mdash;all for 6<hi
       rend="italic">d.</hi> "One Hundred Thousand of this elegant Pocket Edition is all that can be
      produced this year," Warne advertised.<ref target="f011.01.15" n="15"><hi rend="super"
        >15</hi></ref> But the supply must have exceeded the demand, for nothing more is recorded of
      the series.</p>


     <p>Series with longer lives often were transferred from firm to firm. Sometimes they retained
      their baptismal name, as did the Aldine Poets, acquired after Pickering's death in 1854 by
      Bell and Daldy and later inherited (1873) by their successors, George Bell and Sons. Still
      others suffered a name-change every time they passed to a new house, and a few appeared
      simultaneously, under different names, in the catalogues of two or more firms&mdash;the result
      of the practice, not infrequent in that era, of a "publisher-jobber [selling] other firms'
      sheets over his own imprint."<ref target="f011.01.16" n="16"><hi rend="super">16</hi></ref>
      Even libraries retained by the original publisher were not exempt from rechristening whenever
      sales needed a boost. The firms that purveyed serial shockers to the pavement market often did
      the same thing when they started a fresh issue of an old favorite, and the practice is hardly
      extinct today, when individual soft-bound reprints sometimes bear titles different from those
      under which the hard-cover edition appeared.<ref target="f011.01.17" n="17"><hi rend="super"
        >17</hi></ref></p>

     <p>Renamed series and series that led double or triple lives under the <pb n="011.014"/>
      auspices of different firms are the bibliographer's despair. As he attempts to establish their
      provenance and history from the published records of the trade, he feels as if he were
      reviewing a stage army: the same lists of titles turn up again and again under different
      series designations. For example, unless the firm's archives were painstakingly examined, it
      would be an almost hopeless task to disentangle and properly label the various series of
      reprints which the Edinburgh house of Nimmo advertised over two or three decades. Nimmo seems
      to have made a specialty of buying up odds and ends; and he displayed remarkable energy and
      ingenuity in dressing his wares in new bindings and marshaling them under new series titles.
      There is a striking family resemblance between his Cheap Edition of the Poets, Red Line
      Editions (later retitled Popular Edition of the Works of the Poets), and Crown Library, all
      published in the sixties. Nimmo's Library Edition of the British Poets was a reissue of George
      Gilfillan's British Poets, an expensive series originally published by Nimmo's townsman, J.
      Nichol. In 1870 the sheets of this edition were remaindered to a third owner, Cassell, who
      sent them forth again in 6<hi rend="italic">d.</hi> parts as Cassell's Library Edition, and in
      cloth-bound volumes as Cassell's Three-and-Sixpenny Edition.<ref target="f011.01.18" n="18"
        ><hi rend="super">18</hi></ref></p>


     <p>Or take the case of Moxon's Popular Poets, first issued about 1870 at 3<hi rend="italic"
       >s.</hi> 6<hi rend="italic">d.</hi>, then presented in more expensive formats as Moxon's
      Royal Poets (7<hi rend="italic">s.</hi> 6<hi rend="italic">d.</hi>) and Moxon's Library Poets
       (5<hi rend="italic">s.</hi>) As if membership in three separate series were not enough, the
      collection was subsequently acquired by Ward, Lock, who reissued it in cheaper form as Ward,
      Lock's Standard Poets, and in turn by Collins, who converted it into the Grosvenor Poets.</p>

     <p>After coping with genealogies like these, one is grateful for the comparative simplicity of
      concurrent series within a single house. There is no problem, for instance, with Warne's five
      series of the 1860's and '70's: the Chandos Classics, which eventually extended to over 120
      titles, were a cheaper edition of works printed earlier in the Chandos Library of prose
      writers and the Chandos Poets; and the Lansdowne and Arundel Poets were simply alternate
      formats, the one cheap, the <pb n="011.015"/> other expensive, for certain titles in the
      Chandos Poets. In 1882 Warne published Longfellow's <hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> in no fewer
      than four series&mdash;the Chandos Poets, the Chandos Classics, the Arundel Poets, and the
      Lansdowne Poets. Warne, indeed, was one of the most resourceful of all Victorian publishers
      when it came to getting the maximum mileage out of his stock of standard authors. In addition
      to the series already named, in the eighties he offered a dozen or so titles (all of them long
      familiar to readers of his advertisements) in the Imperial Poets, and at the same time a
      virtually identical list in the Albion Poets. The latter genus was divided into several
      species according to binding: 3<hi rend="italic">s.</hi> 6<hi rend="italic">d.</hi> cloth
      gilt, 5<hi rend="italic">s.</hi> imitation half-roxburghe, 7<hi rend="italic">s.</hi> 6<hi
       rend="italic">d.</hi> limp French morocco, 10<hi rend="italic">s.</hi> 6<hi rend="italic"
       >d.</hi> full calf.</p>

     <p>This diversification of binding styles, either under a single series heading or under a new
      name for each style, was common Victorian practice. Many, if not most, series were offered in
      both paper and cloth, and some also were available in at least one kind of leather. In an age
      when middle-class taste favored highly ornate household objects, more than a few publishers
      regarded the printed sheets of a classic work primarily as something around which to sew or
      glue a pretty binding. Nimmo, for instance, devised new bindings every season; between 1870
      and 1873 his Popular Edition of the Works of the Poets could be had in (among others) "Cloth
      Extra, Gold and Colours," "Morocco Extra, with novel prismatic effect and floral silk centre,"
      and "entirely new cloth binding, with beautifully illuminated imitation ivory tablet on
      side."</p>

     <p>Elaborate bindings and lavish internal "embellishments" of course tended to remove such
      books from the cheap-reprint category. But even among reprints whose price was unquestionably
      low, the quality of physical makeup varied widely. The Aldine Poets set a high standard of
      typography and general design that was seldom equalled until the advent of J. M. Dent and his
      Temple and Everyman series. It would be hard to say which series, of the several scores
      published, marked the nadir of cheap book production. The 6<hi rend="italic">d.</hi> plays and
      novels of John Dicks would be a strong contender for the distinction, but numerous other
      series would be in the running. Strenuously small (and often badly worn) type; thin margins,
      sometimes crowded with legends advertising tea, baking powder, or patent medicines; poor
      paper; paper wrappers; flimsy sewing&mdash;these were too often the result of the pressure to
      cut prices. Whatever aesthetic satisfaction the impecunious reader derived from his purchase
      came from the text alone, not from the volume's appearance.</p>

     <p>Though some series were designed for parlor display and thus were of a size that would catch
      the eye, the majority were in small octavo or 12mo., or even as tiny as 32mo.&mdash;true
      "pocket books."<ref target="f011.01.19" n="19"><hi rend="super">19</hi></ref> Not only were
      these smaller sizes, requiring less paper and binding material per volume, more economical to
      produce; they were best adapted to the living habits of the period. Popular books had to be
      portable, for an ever-increasing amount of reading was done in railway carriages and buses,
      and they had to be small enough to find room in the cramped households of the lower-middle and
      working classes, who were coming more and more to constitute the bulk of the reading audience.
      The day of the folio and quarto was over.</p>

     <p>The quantity and quality of text in these series varied as greatly as did the format. Some
      series provided complete texts of the works described on the title-page, while others provided
      only selections or truncated texts, a fact that was often suppressed in advertisements and on
      title-pages. A buyer of Spenser's "works" in one volume, for example, was not likely to
      acquire the whole of the Spenser canon thereby. A reprint publisher especially notorious for
      his cavalier handling of texts was Thomas Tegg, who, according to some of his contemporaries,
      included only as much of a given classic in a volume as the paper set aside for the job
      permitted. Tegg was scarcely unique in this respect. While they may not have been so
      completely lacking in concern for textual accuracy and completeness as to give rise to trade
      legends, most publishers were content to reprint whatever version of a masterpiece came to
      hand, however corrupt or fragmentary the text might be. Even if accuracy had been prized as
      highly in Victorian times as it is today&mdash;at least among scholars&mdash;the economics of
      the cheap reprinting business made careful scrutiny of the printer's copy, and subsequently of
      proofs, a dispensable luxury. Editorial supervision in the modern sense was rare, except in
      the interests of bowdlerization. Money laid out to oblige Mrs. Grundy was a thoroughly
      justifiable business expense.</p>

     <p>The contents of the various series, if subjected to close statistical analysis, would
      provide an interesting, if not always dependable, index of Victorian literary taste and of the
      comparative reputations of classic authors in Victorian times. The relative frequency with
      which various standard works were reprinted, as well as the decline in availability of <pb
       n="011.017"/> certain classics and the rise of others, can be documented by studying the
      advertisements in the trade journals and the lists of reprints-in-series in the <hi
       rend="italic">Reference Catalogue</hi> and Appendix B of the cumulated volumes of the <hi
       rend="italic">English Catalogue</hi>. But one cannot assume that the reprint libraries were
      an unerringly faithful barometer of the literary climate, the publishers readily responding to
      changes in the critical and popular standings of classic authors. Practical considerations,
      such as the publishers' desire to get their full money's worth out of their investment in
      plates and stock, may well have caused certain old standbys, such as Dryden, Pope, Goldsmith,
      Johnson, and Cowper, to overstay their welcome. Accessibility, in short, must not be equated
      with popularity. The fact that Author A was represented in 75 percent of the reprint series
      current at a certain date, while Author B was in only 10 percent, does not prove that Author A
      actually stood that much higher in contemporary esteem. Thus it is quite posssible that by
      artificially prolonging the dominance of certain classic writers in the reprint libraries,
      publishers not only impeded the normal fluctuations of taste but left us a record of popular
      preference which is easily misinterpreted. (Future historians of a classic author's reputation
      in the nineteenth century, take note.) However, until much more information on the inner
      workings of the English book trade is available, the problem of how far the reprint publisher
      was responsive to public taste, and how far he influenced it, must remain a matter for
      speculation.</p>

     <p>The selection of titles for a classic reprint series and the preparation of introductory
      matter often gave employment to well-known men of letters, just as they do today. Robert Bell
      consulted Leigh Hunt when planning his Annotated Edition of the English Poets; it was Hunt who
      encouraged Bell to stray from the beaten path and include some little-known poets in his
       collection.<ref target="f011.01.20" n="20"><hi rend="super">20</hi></ref> After Bell and
      Daldy acquired the Aldine Poets, they called upon men like Lord Houghton, W. M. Rossetti,
      Buxton Forman, and Edward Dowden to prepare new titles for the series. The individual volumes
      in Macmillan's Globe Edition, one of the few relatively authoritative series, were edited by
      men of the stature of David Masson, F. T. Palgrave, and A. W. Ward. William Michael Rossetti
      was the general editor of Moxon's Popular Poets during the brief period before Ward and Lock
      took over the series. He specifically states in his autobiography that revision or emendation
      of the text was not part of his job.<ref target="f011.01.21" n="21"><hi rend="super"
       >21</hi></ref> The Camelot and Canterbury series, issued by Walter Scott, a wealthy Newcastle
      dock and railway <pb n="011.018"/> contractor and colliery owner who turned publisher in his
      late fifties, were edited in part by the self-taught collier-poet Joseph Skipsey, the novelist
      William Sharp, and Ernest Rhys. But perhaps the brightest galaxy of "name" editors was the one
      associated with Kegan Paul's Parchment Library, begun in 1880. It included Dowden, Edmund
      Gosse, Andrew Lang, Richard Garnett, Mark Pattison, Austin Dobson, and George Saintsbury.</p>



     <p>Until Ernest Rhys became the living symbol of Everyman's Library, the single figure most
      conspicuously associated with cheap classic reprints in the public mind was the critic and
      lecturer, Henry Morley. His son-in-law and biographer, Henry Solly, implies that his fame as
      editor of various reprint series somewhat embarrassed his family. "There seemed real danger,"
      wrote Solly, "that he would be remembered after his death only in connection with his services
      for the diffusion of cheap literature"&mdash;a fear which proved not unfounded.<ref
       target="f011.01.22" n="22"><hi rend="super">22</hi></ref>
      <hi rend="italic">Punch</hi> praised him thus, in lines whose sentiment is more to be admired
      than their execution: <q>
       <l>John Bull is not sweet on the type of "Professor,"</l>
       <l>But good Henry Morley was happy possessor</l>
       <l>Of John Bull's respect, John Bull, Junior's, love.</l>
       <l><hi rend="italic">He made Good Letters Cheap!</hi> 'Tis a title above</l>
       <l>Many Dryasdust dignities told in strung letters.</l>
       <l>Ah! many who felt Iron Fortune's stern fetters</l>
       <l>In days ante-Morleyish, look on the rows</l>
       <l>Of cheap Classics, in musical verse and sound prose,</l>
       <l>Which bear the well-known editorial "H.M.,"</l>
       <l>And sigh, "If <hi rend="italic">my</hi> youth-time had only known <hi rend="italic"
         >them</hi>,</l>
       <l>These threepenny treasures, and sixpenny glories,</l>
       <l>These histories, treatises, poems, and stories,</l>
       <l>Which cost in my time a small fortune, what thanks</l>
       <l>And what joys would have swelled o'er their neat-rang&egrave;d ranks!"</l>
       <l>Ah! studious boys must feel gratitude, surely,</l>
       <l>To have lived in the times of the good Henry Morley!<ref target="f011.01.23" n="23"><hi

      </q>
     </p>



     <p>Comment in trade journals suggests that the National Library, which Morley edited for
      Cassell, had the greatest success of any classic-reprint series down to that time. As Solly
      said, "At a cost not exceeding the gas or water rate, a constant supply of good literature
      could be 'laid on' to any house in town or country, and a circulation varying <pb n="011.019"
      /> from 50,000 to 100,000 copies for each volume attests the popular appreciation of the
      enterprise. Letters, which Professor Morley greatly prized, came from the far West in America,
      and from other lands on the borders of civilization, expressing gratitude for these cheap and
      handy volumes, which seemed almost as ubiquitous as Palmer's biscuits."<ref

     <p>Which raises the question, Just how influential were these reprint series in stimulating an
      interest in English masterpieces among the expanding reading public? In a period when cheap
      weeklies like the <hi rend="italic">Family Herald</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Tit-Bits</hi>
      achieved individual circulations of from 500,000 to a million, what place had older works of
      established literary merit in the reading diet of the multitude? One view of the matter was
      reported at the beginning of this article. But what were the facts?</p>

     <p>We have the boasts of certain reprint publishers, for whatever they may be worth. Of
      Macmillan's Globe Edition, "upwards of 140,000 volumes" were sold to the end of 1870;
      presumably this figure includes the sales of the first and most famous member of the series,
      the Shakespeare, which had found 95,000 buyers since publication in December, 1864.<ref
       target="f011.01.25" n="25"><hi rend="super">25</hi></ref> Between the spring of 1870 and May,
      1872, Moxon's sold 150,000 volumes of their Popular Poets.<ref target="f011.01.26" n="26"><hi
        rend="super">26</hi></ref> Over a quarter-million copies of the Miniature Library of the
      Poets were disposed of in the period 1879-1884, according to the publishers, William Kent and
      Co.<ref target="f011.01.27" n="27"><hi rend="super">27</hi></ref> In 1884 Warne and Co.
      advertised that their Chandos Classics, then numbering over 100 titles, had sold 3,500,000
      volumes since publication had begun in 1868.<ref target="f011.01.28" n="28"><hi rend="super"
        >28</hi></ref> Through what seems to have been either unaccountable dereliction or heroic
      restraint on the part of their advertising writer, this figure remained unchanged for several
      years. In 1894, however, Warne revised their copy, and the total to date for the Chandos
      Classics was announced as six million.<ref target="f011.01.29" n="29"><hi rend="super"
        >29</hi></ref> The Canterbury Poets were reported to have sold "about a million volumes"
      within ten years of their beginning in 1884.<ref target="f011.01.30" n="30"><hi rend="super"
        >30</hi></ref> Ward and Lock's Minerva Library <pb n="011.020"/> sold over 150,000 between
      1889 and 1894.<ref target="f011.01.31" n="31"><hi rend="super">31</hi></ref> For some years
      after first publication in 1894-96, the Temple Shakespeare, a forty-volume series, sold
      250,000 volumes annually (and the total between 1894 and 1934 was five million).<ref
       target="f011.01.32" n="32"><hi rend="super">32</hi></ref> Of W. T. Stead's Penny Poets,
      almost five million copies were published in a year, a figure exceeded by Stead's condensed
      Popular Novels, which were said to have sold "about six and a half million."<ref
       target="f011.01.33" n="33"><hi rend="super">33</hi></ref></p>


     <p>These are staggering totals indeed; but in estimating their significance, one must remember
      several things. One is that since most of the series mentioned included some copyright works,
      or at least works whose copyright had only recently lapsed, the figures are not a good
      indication of the current appetite for older literature. Another is that the figures are for
      the total sale of a whole series, which might comprise twenty, fifty, or a hundred volumes.
      The average sale per title would, of course, be only a fraction of the total. Unfortunately,
      with one or two exceptions, such as the Globe one-volume Shakespeare, sales figures for
      individual titles in the various series are unavailable.<ref target="f011.01.00" n="33a"
       >33a</ref> A further consideration is that the totals often, if not always, include export
      sales. Of the annual total for the Temple Shakespeare, for example, 100,000 copies went to
      America;<ref target="f011.01.34" n="34"><hi rend="super">34</hi></ref> and the Empire itself
      provided a large audience for books published in the British Isles.</p>



     <p>Although the books we are concerned with here were designed for the general trade, not for
      classroom use, they were in great demand as school prizes. And, as the advertisements also
      show, they were among the items most favored for family Christmas giving, or for a decorous
      exchange of presents between swain and sweetheart. The extent to which school prizes or
      sentimental gifts were actually read, let alone understood, is, however, something else again.
      As George Gissing observed, "Hardly will a prudent statistician venture to declare that one in
      every score of those who actually read sterling books do so with comprehension of their
      author. These dainty series of noble and delightful works, which have so seemingly wide an
      acceptance, think you they vouch for true appreciation in all who buy them? Remember those who
      purchase to follow the fashion, to impose upon their <pb n="011.021"/> neighbor, or even to
      flatter themselves; think of those who wish to make cheap presents, and those who are merely
      pleased by the outer aspect of the volume."<ref target="f011.01.35" n="35"><hi rend="super"
        >35</hi></ref></p>


     <p>Gissing's pessimism was widely shared throughout the Victorian period; more widely than ever
      at the end of the epoch, when the reading preferences of the masses had been fully expressed
      at public libraries and newsagents', and the verdict was overwhelmingly in favor of light
      novels and penny papers. "The constant flow of new editions of Great Authors," observed a
      writer in the <hi rend="italic">Academy</hi> in 1903, "is deceptive. They are regarded as part
      of the necessary furniture of the house&mdash;not of the mind; and having been duly and
      dutifully bought they are taught to know their place on the appointed shelf. They are taken as
      read. . . . There are few men now who, when a new book is published, read an old one."<ref
       target="f011.01.36" n="36"><hi rend="super">36</hi></ref></p>


     <p>In such views &mdash; and examples could be multiplied from the annals of the
      nineteenth-century reading public&mdash;there is more than a hint of snobbery. The phenomenon
      of a semi-literate reading audience numbering in the millions stirred the residual social
      prejudices of the class who wrote for, and read, the leading literary journals, and it was
      only to be expected that they would exaggerate the situation they deplored. On the other hand,
      there were sturdy believers in the common man's capacity for literary culture and his active
      interest in acquiring it. The best-known of these was Charles Dickens, who told the Birmingham
      Society of Artists in 1853, "I believe there are in Birmingham at this moment many working men
      infinitely better versed in Shakespeare and in Milton than the average of fine gentlemen in
      the days of bought-and-sold dedications and dear books."<ref target="f011.01.37" n="37"><hi
        rend="super">37</hi></ref> Every public man who had faith in mechanics' institutes and free
      libraries as disseminators of culture among the middle and lower classes, everyone who
      advocated the repeal of the newspaper tax, the amendment of the copyright law, and other
      schemes connected with spreading the blessings of cheap print, asserted that the multitude was
      ready and eager for good literature.<ref target="f011.01.38" n="38"><hi rend="super"
       >38</hi></ref></p>

     <pb n="011.022"/>

     <p>As events proved, there was just as much exaggeration on this side of the issue. The bright
      words of hope uttered at mid-century, when the "taxes on knowledge" and the absence of free
      libraries were alleged to be the only barriers to the development of a broadly cultured
      populace, were seldom echoed a generation later. It was indisputable that the widening of
      educational opportunity had not been accompanied by the same degree of literary enlightenment.
      In 1886 a writer in the <hi rend="italic">Nineteenth Century</hi> said: "Cheap editions have
      brought standard works within their [the workers'] reach, and though the privilege is not
      largely availed of, it is not altogether neglected. . . . Lots of working men have studied
      with great care one or two of Shakespeare's plays; others know one or two of Dickens's works
      almost by heart. . . . At the same time there are working men who will devour every book they
      can buy or can secure from friends, and a curious undigested, if not indigestible, mass they
      do sometimes get hold of. Hundreds, on the other hand, have never read a line of a book." But
      having achieved this precarious balance on the fence, the writer continued: "The chief
      difficulty about literature for the working classes is to reach them. If the literature were
      lying on their table they would often read, but they seldom sally forth into the highways and
      byways of the literary world to discover what they shall purchase."<ref target="f011.01.39"
       n="39"><hi rend="super">39</hi></ref> Since it was at this very time that paper-bound classic
      reprints were finding wider distribution through newsagents and other channels, one would
      expect to hear no more complaint that cheap reprints were difficult to obtain. Yet fifteen
      years later&mdash;in 1901&mdash;another writer, committed to the assumption that "hordes of
      men and women . . . are waiting to respond to an offer of really good and really cheap books,"
      alleged that the trouble still lay in distribution (more specifically, the high postal rate
      charged for books as against the negligible cost of mailing sensational papers) and price. The
      solution he put forth was the issue of weekly volumes in a "General Library" subdivided into
      series, to be sold by subscription: 104 volumes in two years, total cost &pound;4 in paper,
      &pound;6 in cloth.<ref target="f011.01.40" n="40"><hi rend="super">40</hi></ref></p>



     <p>There was nothing really new in this proposal; but the very fact that it was reiterated
      defines the position of the idealist confronted with a situation in whose permanence he
      refuses to believe. The hard fact seemed to be that the constant activity in cheap reprint
      series for the <pb n="011.023"/> past seventy years had not made the common man a devotee of
      great literature; no combination of merchandising devices, no amount of cheapening, had
      achieved that goal. But men who shared Dickens' and Sir John Herschel's and Wilkie Collins'
      faith in the common man's latent hunger for literary experience clung to the familiar
      Victorian reliance on "the proper measures." Fortunately for us, that spirit is not lost in
      our own time, as the many recent experiments in reprinting books of great worth in soft covers
      attest.</p>

     <p>However short the cheap reprint series fell of the most optimistic expectations in Victorian
      times, they were responsible for a wider popular interest in classic English literature than
      would otherwise have prevailed during the era. Concurrently with them, designed especially for
      students facing the various examinations for university admission and civil service posts, but
      undoubtedly finding an additional market beyond the crammers, were published a score or more
      of concise manuals, outlines, and other study-guides of English literature. <hi rend="italic"
       >Chambers's Cyclopaedia of English Literature</hi>, originally published (1842-43) in weekly
      numbers, and in two volumes (1844), within a few years sold 130,000 copies in England
       alone.<ref target="f011.01.41" n="41"><hi rend="super">41</hi></ref> During the Victorian
      period, too, there was a revival, to which the proliferation of cheap classic reprints
      undoubtedly contributed, of appreciative literary journalism. In both periodicals and
      collected volumes, the bookish commentaries of men like Gosse, Lang, Birrell, Dowden, and
      Saintsbury delighted readers who, in another age, would have read Lamb, Hazlitt, and Hunt.
      Demand increased for popular biographies of literary figures. Macmillan's English Men of
      Letters series, a pioneer in its field, sold over 300,000 copies between 1878, when the first
      volumes, priced at 2<hi rend="italic">s.</hi> 6<hi rend="italic">d.</hi>, were published, and
      1887, when a reissue in monthly volumes, at 1<hi rend="italic">s.</hi> in paper, 1<hi
       rend="italic">s.</hi>6<hi rend="italic">d.</hi> in cloth, was begun. Some of the titles were
      reprinted from three to six times in the first ten years, while others had only a single
       reprinting.<ref target="f011.01.42" n="42"><hi rend="super">42</hi></ref> The popularity of
      the various volumes evidently depended on the contemporary interest in the author treated and
      on the reputation of the man who wrote the biography itself.</p>



     <p>The great majority of the boys and girls and men and women into whose hands fell copies of
      cheap classic reprints did not leave any printed record of their pleasure. Only occasionally
      did the mute, inglorious common reader take pen in hand, in the manner of the <pb n="011.024"
      /> Lancashire workman who wrote to Cassell's that the first twenty-three volumes of the
      National Library "have done a great deal of good even in my own neighbourhood, for several of
      my own friends have given up drinking for the sake of taking and reading your beautiful little
       books."<ref target="f011.01.43" n="43"><hi rend="super">43</hi></ref> But a systematic
      combing of the memoirs of eventually well-known people who grew up in the Victorian period
      would reveal how many cultivated and expanded their literary taste by reading these
      inexpensive volumes. Thomas Hardy's first copy of Shelley was an edition of <hi rend="italic"
       >Queen Mab and Other Poems</hi> published in the Cottage Library.<ref target="f011.01.44"
       n="44"><hi rend="super">44</hi></ref> Havelock Ellis' interest in the Elizabethan drama,
      which was to bear fruit in his editorship of the Mermaid series, was nurtured by his buying,
      as a schoolboy at Mitcham in the early 1870's, successive penny numbers of Dicks's Standard
       Plays.<ref target="f011.01.45" n="45"><hi rend="super">45</hi></ref> Dicks's penny-number
      edition of Shakespeare was affectionately remembered by Thomas Burt, the Labour politician:
      "No matter that the print was small and the paper poor; no matter that there were neither
      theatre nor stage, neither actors nor orchestra. All the more scope was given to fancy and
      imagination."<ref target="f011.01.46" n="46"><hi rend="super">46</hi></ref> Perhaps the final
      word may be that of the journalist Sir John Hammerton, looking back on his early days in
      Glasgow, about the time he left school and went to work as a correspondence clerk. In his
      reminiscences he exclaimed of Cassell's National Library: "What an Aladdin's cave that proved
      to me! Addison, Goldsmith, Bacon, Steele, DeQuincey. . . ., Charles Lamb, Macaulay and many
      scores of others whom old Professor Morley introduced to me&mdash;what a joy of life I
      obtained from these, and how greatly they made life worth living!"<ref target="f011.01.47"

       reason. The appendix of the Marlowe volume in the Mermaid series, edited by young Have-lock
       Ellis, referred to certain blasphemous opinions attributed to the dramatist. The resultant
       uproar "in various quarters" (even Swinburne and John Addington Symonds were shocked) caused
       Henry Vizetelly, the publisher, to prepare a new edition in which the objectionable passages
       were suppressed, as well as cancels for insertion in unsold copies of the original edition. A
       little later, after Vizetelly's imprisonment for selling translations of Zola, and his
       subsequent death, the series was acquired by Fisher Unwin, who dismissed Ellis from the
       editorship, removed his name from the volumes, and incurred his life-long contempt. See

       former committee (Qq. 1368-1375) that poetry "is a great deal read" by the working class,
       "and of course the result is, very much poetry is written by working people. Anybody
       connected with a newspaper knows what an enormous flood of poetry the working classes send in
       the course of a year." "The higher class of poetry," he continued, was "very much read by the
       working people. . . . Shakespeare is known by heart, almost," and Milton also was "much
       read." But it would be idle to assume that these assertions were true of any but a tiny
       minority of the working class.</p></note>

     <head/>
     <p>DURING THE LAST FEW DECADES SO MANY NEW editions of letters have been produced that any
      editor contemplating still another must pause and take his bearings. In the edition of Lady
      Mary Wortley Montagu's letters which I am now preparing I hope to be guided by the virtues and
      warned by the faults of others before me. But if in my remarks here I raise questions which I
      do not answer with definite conviction, it is because my editorial resolutions are still
      somewhat flexible.</p>

     <p>Certainly it is easy enough to criticize nineteenth-century editors of letters. We are often
      impatient with their methods&mdash;their casual attitude toward accuracy of text, their skimpy
      and superficial annotations, their partisan attitudes, and their diligence in excising any
      word or passage that might bring a blush to a maiden's cheek or a blot to a family escutcheon.
      Perhaps we can regard them more kindly if we recall what they conceived their function to be.
      They intended their editions to be enjoyed by a reading public interested in genuine
      literature but intolerant of pedantry and dullness. These editors did not require patronage or
      subsidies&mdash;from either well-endowed angels or universities; they prepared their handy
      volumes for a reading public who bought and read.</p>

     <p>It is inconceivable, for example, that&mdash;aside from the indelicacy of publishing a
      living writer's complete letters&mdash;there could have been produced in the nineteenth
      century such a work as Professor Haight's recent seven-volume edition of the George Eliot
      letters. Let me say immediately that this edition is admirable as an editorial job; its only
      fault, reviewers have agreed, is that the letters are terribly dull. Although it is a useful
      work for the study of nineteenth-century literature, and will no doubt prove its value to
      students of George Eliot, of the novel, of literary economics, of German influence, of medical
      history, <pb n="011.026"/> its warmest defenders will hardly allege that it will be read by
      any one whose interests are unconfined by any of these special subjects.</p>

     <p>Here, I believe, is the prime difference between letter-editing in the nineteenth century
      and today. In our view letters have become "documents"; and the editor, instead of presenting
      a literary work, is setting up an archive. The long shelves of books are no longer meant to be
      read but only to be referred to. Is this not corroborated by the proliferation of indexes in
      recent editions? Professor Haight has been temperate in allowing himself one uncomplicated
      index; what are we to think of Dr. Chapman's three-volume edition of Johnson's letters with
      its seven immense indexes? If index-learning turns no student pale, how fortunate is the
      student who holds the eel of science by seven tails!</p>

     <p>Our editions differ from the nineteenth century's in another related way: our tendency to
      "monumentalize" editions of letters, to provide&mdash;as Dr. Chapman's reviewer in the <hi
       rend="italic">Times Literary Supplement</hi> writes&mdash; "an edition which shall be,
      humanly speaking, definitive and final." The sceptic may well wonder how definitive and final
      this edition can be when each volume has a section of addenda, and there is even a last minute
      inclusion in the preliminary leaves of Volume I. Our concept of definitive
      editions&mdash;which nineteenth-century editors did not try to produce&mdash;is perhaps
      related to the advertisements one sees by beauty parlors which offer <hi rend="italic"
       >permanent</hi> waves "guaranteed for three months." Our desire to make these editions all
      inclusive leads us to throw into them every scrap of writing by, to, and about the writer,
      every collateral and associated reference however remote; and so annotations grow in length
      and appendixes in number.</p>

     <p>Besides differing from us in their attitude toward readability and toward completeness,
      nineteenth-century editors necessarily reflected the genteel tone and taboos of their time.
      Thus in 1861 when Moy Thomas edited Lady Mary Wortley Montagu's letters he was confronted in
      one of her gossipy ones with a scandalous anecdote, and rather than discard it&mdash;for it
      makes a clever, vivid episode&mdash;he dropped it into a footnote and labeled it an excerpt
      from an anonymous friend's letter to her. Of course, following the editorial practice of his
      time, he corrected her grammar and usage like a fussy governess; and he emasculated or omitted
      her frank expressions and racy anecdotes. Today, fortunately, Victorian prudishness has given
      way to plain frankness. No word is too crude for the editors of Walpole's correspondence to
      transcribe or translate. The editor of Hart Crane's letters, a few years ago, published the
      full record of that poet's neurotic existence&mdash;only <pb n="011.027"/> twenty years after
      his death. There can be no difference of opinion as to the desirability of transcription
      without bowdlerizing; for in an age when four-letter words unabashedly litter our fiction, and
      Freudian theory has passed into everyday lingo, the editor need not be a verbal or moral
      censor.</p>

     <p>Before discussing specific questions of text and annotation, I should like to discriminate
      between what we may consider the letters written by writers who are noted for their other
      writings and the letters by writers noted mainly for their letters. This distinction, I
      believe, has some bearing on the form of the edition. For the eighteenth century&mdash;which I
      am primarily concerned with&mdash;we may consider as letter-writers Lord Chesterfield, whose
      letters were last edited by Bonamy Dobr&eacute;e in 1932; Horace Walpole, whose correspondence
      under the urbane general-editorship of Mr. Lewis has been in progress since 1937; and Lady
      Mary Wortley Montagu, whose letters, last edited in 1861, still await complete publication.
      For these three writers, letters are their main claim to a place in literary history; hence
      they can be classified as letter-writers rather than mere writers of letters. The letter as a
       <hi rend="italic">genre</hi> was exceptionally congenial to their talents, and they expended
      on it all their self-conscious, disciplined craft. In contrast, there are the mere writers of
      letters&mdash;Addison, edited in 1951; Steele, edited by Professor Blanchard in 1941; and
      Pope, whose correspondence has recently been edited by Professor Sherburn. Unquestionably
      these letters are important in literary history, but it is at least debatable whether they are
      themselves literature. To Addison and to Steele letters were a functional means of transacting
      business or sending messages. Addison's letters smell of the Public Record Office, where many
      of them indeed lie; and doesn't one become a little tired of the repetitive "Dear Prue" notes
      of Steele?</p>

     <p>Between these two categories&mdash;letter-writers and writers of letters&mdash;fall Thomas
      Gray, edited in 1935, and Johnson, edited by Dr. Chapman in 1952. Neither Gray's nor Johnson's
      stature comes from their letters alone, but it is raised by them. Gray's scintillate with the
      lively intimacy repressed in his external life; and Johnson's display the drama of a combative
      many-sided personality. Many readers, no doubt, go to these letters not for any particular
      fact but for the enjoyment of reading.</p>

     <p>And now to the editor's problems&mdash;to his "job of work." He must first decide what to
      include in his edition. This problem is, today, less obvious than it would seem. All of us
      agree that every letter <hi rend="italic">by</hi> the writer should be included, whether it
      survives in manuscript or only <pb n="011.028"/> in a printed copy. The headaches that afflict
      editors of printed works in deciding on a correct copy-text are spared the letter editor: the
      manuscript has prime authority, and where it does not survive, then the printed text closest
      to it. In printing every letter, the editor may have to welcome brief and inconsequential
      notes. It is Robert Browning's recent editor, I believe, who was confronted by scores of
      postal cards on which the poet had merely accepted or declined dinner invitations. Fortunately
      eighteenth-century letter-writers did not bother to write letters unless they had something to
      say in them. Johnson remarked to an old friend, "I find myself very unwilling to take up a pen
      only to tell my friends that I am well." And where only brief notes survive, they are valuable
      for filling in sparsely documented biography.</p>

     <p>If most editors print all the letters <hi rend="italic">by</hi> their writers, there is some
      disagreement in the matter of printing letters <hi rend="italic">to</hi> or even <hi
       rend="italic">about</hi> them. Professor Haight calls his edition <hi rend="italic">The
       George Eliot Letters</hi>, yet only two-thirds of the letters come from her pen. The editions
      of Gray and of Walpole, called correspondences, print letters to and from these writers; so
      does Professor Sherburn, although since he also prints letters by Pope's friends to each
      other, his edition may be called "Pope and His Circle." A more extreme example of this
      tendency is Theodore Besterman's edition of Voltaire's correspondence, now in progress; and
      that collection, one may observe, is not so much an edition of letters as a collection of
      materials toward Voltaire's biography.</p>

     <p>The practice of giving both sides of a correspondence&mdash;as we see in the Walpole
      edition&mdash;has obvious advantages; it also has the disadvantage of swelling the volumes
      with a great mass of material which is dull and only of oblique literary interest. Horace
      Mann's letters to Walpole illustrate this; and his editors even print the long official
      documents which Mann occasionally enclosed. If this correspondence is intended to be a
      political history of the eighteenth century, the plan is sound; but it is difficult to see its
      literary justification. Mr. Lewis admits as much, when he writes (in <hi rend="italic"
       >Collector's Progress</hi>), "From the first the <hi rend="italic">Yale Walpole</hi> has been
      planned as an encyclopedia of eighteenth century life and thought."</p>

     <p>Any decision as to what to print rests ultimately on two factors: what is the edition's
      purpose and what materials are available. If I may discuss, for the moment, my own concern
      with Lady Mary's letters, this is how it works out: I wish to present, essentially, her own
      writings&mdash;not because they are a source of historical, literary, social, or biographical
      information, but because they have value as literature. (I need not take time now to say why
      they can be considered so; we can accept the <pb n="011.029"/> sanction of critical opinion
      since her own time.) In round numbers I have about 800 letters written by Lady Mary, more than
      twice the number printed by her last editor. Of these 800, about 650 survive in
      manuscript&mdash;which will give my text a solid and reliable basis.</p>

     <p>What of the surviving letters written to her? Should they be printed in the text? I have
      about 90 from her husband, and about 60 drafts of letters sent to her by the Countess of
      Oxford. These two series are so dry and dull that they would, if printed, infect the book with
      a deadly tedium. I plan instead to quote from them, only where relevant, in my annotations.
      Lady Mary's correspondence with Pope presents a different problem. There are about 20 of his
      letters to her; and although they illustrate Pope's inflamed imagination and one of his
      epistolary styles, they tell us very little about Lady Mary's lost letters to him. Since
      Professor Sherburn has carefully printed from manuscript this series of letters from Pope,
      there is no point in my duplicating the text. The only surviving letters from Lady Mary to
      Pope are two very brief notes sent after his effusive friendship and correspondence had
      abated. These two will appear in my text, in accordance with my rule that all of her letters
      deserve a place there.</p>

     <p>Her correspondence with Lord Hervey raises still a different problem. For over twenty years
      they maintained a lively friendship, usually sympathetic but sometimes malicious. (Lady Mary
      is responsible for the epigram that there are three sexes: men, women, and Herveys.) After his
      death his son courteously sealed up all of Lady Mary's letters and returned them to her. Not a
      single one has come down to us. But of Hervey's letters to her, I have his manuscript copies
      of 43 which have never been printed. Many of them are direct replies to those she sent him,
      and so they tell us something of her lost letters; they are, besides, of great interest in
      their own right, displaying the copious talent and skill that make his <hi rend="italic"
       >Memoirs of the Reign of George II</hi> such a brilliant document. I plan to print them as
      part of my text; or, if I lose heart at thus flouting my own rule, I can assign them to an
      appendix.</p>

     <p>Having decided, in general, that only Lady Mary's own letters belong in the text, and that
      those to her belong in the annotations, I must next decide how to arrange them: in a single
      chronological sequence or in separate correspondences. Mr. Lewis's edition of Walpole and the
      Nichol Smith-Cleanth Brooks edition of Bishop Percy's letters follow the latter arrangement.
      Mr. Lewis's defense of it for his edition seems to me persuasive for two special reasons: that
      both sides of the Walpole correspondences are very fully printed, and that Walpole channeled
      his four main interests among particular friends&mdash;so <pb n="011.030"/> that each series
      has an inherent unity. But editors of both letter-writers and writers of letters generally
      prefer the single sequence. The fascination of reading these collections comes from seeing the
      gradual unfolding of their writers' lives and ideas, as well as their coherent comments on
      topics which caught their interest.</p>

     <p>If editors agree on the arrangement of their letters, they diverge sharply in the matter of
      how to present their texts. The root of the divergence is the fact that the copy-text is a
      manuscript. The editor must decide, essentially, whether he wishes to put the letter into the
      reader's hands as a manuscript or as a printed text. Dr. Chapman writes in his introduction:
      "I have aimed at reproducing my manuscripts as closely as typography admits." But does he? I
      notice, for example, that he does not reproduce Johnson's long <hi rend="italic">s.</hi> I
      believe, perhaps na&iuml;vely, that the exact reproduction of a manuscript is impossible. Even
      if we used a photo-process, we should then begin to worry about the color of the ink, the
      quality of the paper, the manner of folding the sheet, and so on. When we decide to reproduce
      it by means of typography, we have made a great concession; and once having made it we need
      not be stingy as to its extent. No reader of the book will be fooled into thinking he has a
      manuscript in his hand.</p>

     <p>Dr. Chapman, of course, is neither the innovator of this point of view, nor even its most
      extreme champion. The Toynbee-Whibley edition of Gray prints long <hi rend="italic">s</hi>'s,
      abbreviations, and raised letters; it is fussy and finicky about every detail of the
      manuscript. It does not indent, so that we sometimes come up against a tight-packed, full page
      of dense type without a crack in the text to allow us a breath. As a reference work this
      edition is excellent, but who reads it? At the other extreme of textual style&mdash;that of
      normalizing&mdash;stand the newest editions of Walpole and Chesterfield. Mr. Lewis's practice
      is to retain Walpole's spelling of proper names and (careful) punctuation, but to normalize
      other spellings and capitalization. Professor Dobr&eacute;e also normalizes spelling and
      capitalization. His object, he writes in his preface, has been "to make the text as
      pleasurable as possible to the reader of today, while altering as little as possible." As a
      general principle this makes good sense.</p>

     <p>It seems paradoxical that political and social historians&mdash;who, one would think, are
      sticklers for exactness&mdash;should prefer normalized texts, whereas literary historians
      strive for exact transcription. I can only conjecture why this is so: the former group want
      the letters set forth as factually exact as possible but without any distracting irrelevances
      because to them the facts are paramount; literary historians believe <pb n="011.031"/> that
      they will lose the nuances of style if the text is normalized, and that these small details
      convey the flavor of the writer's personality and milieu. Between these extremes there are
      other sensible styles. Nichol Smith writes in his edition of the Burnet-Ducket letters: "It
      has been found desirable to expand the simpler contractions and to add occasionally to the
      punctuation"; but in his Swift-Ford letters (twenty-one years later), although he expands
      contractions he retains raised letters for titles&mdash;a confusing procedure when footnote
      numerals are also raised. (One would think a title like Lord or Duchess simple enough to
      expand.) Professor Tinker in his 1924 edition of Boswell's letters has normalized except for
      spelling; and it is only necessary to glance at his page to see how much is gained and how
      little lost.</p>

     <p>What kind of text&mdash;to come to my own job&mdash;do I plan to use for Lady Mary's
      letters? I am fairly certain that I do not want a facsimile manuscript reproduction. Nor do I
      want the letters to look as though they had appeared in this morning's <hi rend="italic"
       >Times</hi>. My solution, a compromise, comes from these factors: that the edition will be
      published by a university press, and so must be scholarly and reasonably complete; that as a
      great letter-writer Lady Mary will attract readers beyond the ranks of eighteenth-century
      students and scholars; and that her letters, as manuscripts, raise several peculiar
      problems.</p>

     <p>I have therefore decided on the following style. I shall reproduce her exact spelling and
      capitalization. The range of her spelling&mdash;extending over more than fifty years of her
      activity as a letter-writer&mdash;illustrates the gradual evolution of her writing from that
      of a girl haphazardly and self-educated to that of a poised woman of letters. Her spelling of
      family and place names is historically useful. Her use of capitals for nouns, though
      unsystematic, was often her way of achieving emphasis. These differences (in spelling and
      capitalization) from twentieth-century norms do not impede the reader, for he finds them in
      the printed texts of the eighteenth century. In regard to capitalization, Mr. Lewis states
      that it is often not possible to be sure when the writer intended a capital; but an editor,
      who is presumably best qualified to read the manuscript, is least likely to make this error in
      transcription.</p>

     <p>With all abbreviations (including the ampersand) and with raised letters I intend to be
      pitiless: the contractions and abbreviations will be expanded in full, and the raised letters
      lowered to the plane where they belong. (Proper names will be expanded within square
      brackets.) These niceties are of no more importance, it seems to me, than an extra flourish of
      the pen or the placing of a date on the left or right <pb n="011.032"/> hand side of the
      manuscript page. It may be objected that abbreviations are significant in showing the degree
      of familiarity or of formality in a letter, for letter-writers tended to avoid abbreviations
      in their formal notes. But surely we judge the tone of a letter by its actual words and ideas
      and not by its flourishes and shorthand. As the reader picks his way through stenographic
      symbols like <hi rend="italic">D</hi><hi rend="super">s</hi> for <hi rend="italic"
       >Duchess</hi> or <hi rend="italic">y</hi><hi rend="super">m</hi> for <hi rend="italic"
       >them</hi>, he may forget the thought. Even Dr. Chapman, so faithful to his manuscripts, does
      not reproduce Johnson's "displayed" conclusions because he believes they would waste space and
      offend the eye. Professor Sherburn, with more precision, uses vertical lines (as in the
      bibliographical description of title pages) to set forth the conclusions of Pope's letters;
      but it is difficult to see any advantage beyond mere exactness. Nor do I see any benefit in
      indicating the pages of the manuscript letter, as the editors of Percy's letters do by
      printing marginal glosses. As a result their page is disfigured, and the reader is burdened
      with useless information about the physical condition of the manuscript.</p>

     <p>How should the editor treat the writer's erasures (assuming he can read them) and
      inadvertent errors like repeated or omitted small words and syllables? Dr. Chapman neglects
      Johnson's erasures but preserves his inadvertences "partly because they furnish some
      indication of his state of health or his state of mind, partly because they show the sort of
      error to which he was prone. . . ." As good or even a better case can be made for preserving
      the one and neglecting the other; for the erasures show us the writer's literal intention,
      whereas his inadvertences provide an incalculable number of speculative possibilities. When
      Johnson repeats a syllable in carrying a divided word over to a new page, what does that
      signify? Perhaps merely that a fly alighted on his nose and distracted his attention. For both
      types of lapses the editor need not set himself any rigid rules. In many instances he can
      avail himself of square brackets to insert what the reader does need, and common sense to omit
      what the reader clearly does not.</p>

     <p>My most radical treatment of the text is this: I shall add punctuation where the sense
      demands it, and I shall capitalize the first word of every sentence. Lady Mary's custom in
      these two respects is rather cavalier; its exact reproduction would be meaningless. I have
      noticed that when I read a text exactly reproduced from manuscript, a sentence ending without
      a period or a sentence beginning with a lower-case letter stops me in my tracks, and my eye
      swings forward and back to catch hold of the sense. Careful analysis of the clauses usually
      determines the sentence sense; and if the editor does this first, then the reader can read
      without interruption.</p>

     <pb n="011.033"/>

     <p>The exact typographical copy of a manuscript has this ironic effect (as Mr. Lewis shrewdly
      remarks); it "imparts an air of quaintness to a text which was not apparent to the
      correspondents themselves." For their letters printed in their own day do not challenge the
      modern eye, as we can see in any eighteenth-century collection. The text-style I have chosen,
      then, is a compromise, but I believe a sensible one&mdash;something between eighteenth-century
      printed and manuscript styles and at the same time hospitable to the modern reader. So much
      for my text. These matters of spelling, capitalization, abbreviations, and punctuation are
      relatively trivial compared to the fact that every word written by Lady Mary in her letters
      will be clearly reproduced.</p>

     <p>A manuscript letter contains more than simply the writer's message; and the editor must
      decide how to deal with this other material. The recipient's name and the date of the letter,
      although they may not appear on the letter (and are hence editorial intrusions) are obviously
      a necessary adjunct to the letter if it is to be intelligible. The postmark, if any, should be
      recorded, for it is evidence that the letter was actually sent, and may have some bearing on
      the letter's date of composition and of transmission. But I see no reason why it should be
      with the text when it can be dropped into a footnote. The endorsement, since it is also part
      of the letter, should also appear on the page&mdash;under the text, if by the writer; as a
      footnote, if by the recipient. Most of Lady Mary's letters to her husband were endorsed by him
      with a date and a summary of their contents, and this information is often clarifying.</p>

     <p>Does the editor have to record which passages in a letter have been struck out by the
      recipient or subsequent owners of the manuscript? Here his own judgment takes precedence over
      definite rules. Of course he will always decipher and print the passages. Any mutilation of
      the manuscript likely to mislead a later user can be noted at the foot of the page. This
      editorial problem does not exist in Lady Mary's letters, for her heirs, instead of using
      scissors or india ink, more effectively censored the letters which they disapproved of by
      burning them. Fanny Burney censored her father's letters, Mr. James Osborn tells us; there is
      good literary justification for an editor's noting her editorial treatment. The recent owners
      of Boswell's manuscripts censored before selling; and to record their attempts at suppression
      may illustrate Victorian prudery, but nothing is thus added to Boswell's letters. Mr. Lewis's
      edition of Walpole points out what has been omitted in previous printed editions. Although
      this unwittingly focusses the reader's attention on the scandalous and off-color anecdotes, it
      adds nothing to <pb n="011.034"/> the letters. Any reader interested in what earlier editions
      have omitted can simply collate the printed texts.</p>

     <p>With a manuscript letter in his hand the editor can disregard a previously printed copy. But
      if he cannot find the manuscript and must depend on a printed text, he must be
      grateful&mdash;and very cautious. In my own work on Lady Mary's letters I have had a variety
      of illuminating experiences. Moy Thomas printed a letter from Lady Mary to her daughter, but
      he could not find the original among the Wortley Manuscripts, and so he took his text from
      Dallaway, Lady Mary's first acknowledged editor (in 1803). The letter contains an elaborate
      anecdote about William Pitt's ministry, and Thomas footnotes it thus: "It is remarkable that
      Lady Mary herself appears to have appropriated the passage from a letter of her friend, Miss
      Tichborne"; and he then quotes the identical passage from the friend's (manuscript) letter.
      But the truth of the matter is that Lady Mary's letter&mdash;which exists among the Wortley
      Manuscripts, though Thomas could not find it&mdash;does not contain the anecdote. Dallaway had
      simply transferred it from the friend's to Lady Mary's letter. Thomas should have been on
      guard, particularly since in his preface he accuses Dallaway of flagrant tampering.</p>

     <p>Of greater importance than this kind of conflation&mdash;which an editor can discover by
      carefully checking his manuscripts&mdash;are those letters which exist only in printed form
      and without clear authority. The editor of Lady Mary's letters must deal with this situation:
      her Embassy Letters were published posthumously and without her family's permission, but their
      authenticity is beyond doubt since her own manuscript still exists. Four years later the same
      publisher issued an <hi rend="italic">Additional Volume</hi> containing six letters, of which
      one had been published long before (in 1719). The other five, I do not doubt, are spurious,
      yet they have since then been printed among Lady Mary's letters. Moy Thomas put them in his
      text, labeled as of doubtful authenticity, but that has not prevented careless literary
      historians and anthologists from using them as examples of Lady Mary's epistolary art. How
      shall I treat them in my edition? Probably consign them to the purgatory of an appendix.</p>

     <p>What of each letter's provenience as a manuscript and its bibliographical history? Most
      modern editors put these facts at the head of the letters. I believe that this information,
      although interesting and perhaps important, is primarily antiquarian; and so instead of
      cluttering the text to the reader's distraction, it can be neatly dropped into the
      footnotes.</p>

     <pb n="011.035"/>

     <p>Having set up the text of his letters the editor must then wrestle with his annotations. In
      this bout he will find even less agreement than in textual style. "It is impossible," wrote
      Dr. Johnson, "for an expositor not to write too little for some, and too much for others." Mr.
      Lewis's Walpole annotations are considered by many to err on the side of generosity; and in
      England one hears quips about the full genealogies attached to everyone mentioned in the text.
      This tendency to annotate Walpole widely and deeply has become more pronounced in the Mann
      correspondence, so that the volumes are becoming not a source for political history but a
      veritable reference collection. Whether or not one agrees with this objection, there can be no
      doubt as to the balance, tact, and efficient accuracy of these annotations.</p>

     <p>Although the editor may set up formulas to determine what requires elucidation, he must
      actually judge each instance individually. When Lady Mary writes of <hi rend="italic"
       >Gulliver's Travels</hi>: ". . . and very wonderful it is, God knows!" should the reader be
      referred to the Bible <hi rend="italic">passim</hi> or to Sir Harold Williams' bibliographical
      study? But if she refers to an obscure politician, the reader should be told his identity and
      referred to the <hi rend="italic">DNB</hi>. If you will recall my initial premise&mdash;that
      the reader wishes to read the letters&mdash;then the annotations must remain subservient. They
      must not be tantalizingly brief lest they generate their own puzzles. Nor should the editor
      disregard a name or quotation or allusion in a letter because&mdash;he may
      rationalize&mdash;his main job was to present the text.</p>

     <p>It would be easy, but not really necessary, to quote examples of faulty annotations. Let me
      instead give a couple of samples of how I intend to deal with this. In a letter from Avignon,
      Lady Mary writes to Lady Oxford in October 1744 that she supposes the slowness of the mails is
      "occasioned by the cessation of correspondence between Dover and Calais." My footnote reads:
      "War between England and France had broken out on 15 March 1744." Merely that. It is not
      necessary to give the causes or battles of the war, the organization of the post office, or a
      survey of postal routes in 1744. In the same letter Lady Mary sends her opinion of Pope's
      will; and in my footnote I quote the few sentences from Lady Oxford's letter which had told
      Lady Mary the news. I doubt that more is required, for this is not a biography of Pope or a
      study of his reputation; it is a letter by Lady Mary.</p>

     <p>Should passages in foreign languages be translated in the footnotes? Most editors have
      conceded that the reader of even scholarly editions needs to have Latin translated for him.
      (Professor Sherburn's edition of Pope does not make this concession.) The relatively few Latin
      quotations in Lady Mary's letters will be translated in the footnotes. And <pb n="011.036"/>
      like all these other editors I do not intend to translate French passages. To the reader
      unfamiliar with that language, about twenty newly discovered letters in French by Lady Mary
      will have to remain buried in the obscurity of a modern language.</p>

     <p>I hope Dr. Chapman's extensive use of abbreviations in his letterheads and footnotes does
      not win many imitators. (So far, Miss Norton, in her edition of Gibbon's letters, has
      imitated.) The reader must fight his way through an alphabetical thicket, for he is forced to
      expand initials into names so frequently that reading gives way to mnemonics. The elaboration
      of short cuts can reach a point of diminishing returns. I also confess myself irritated by Dr.
      Chapman's abbreviated year dates &mdash;'74 for 1774. Only one space is saved, and again the
      reader's attention is distracted by having to fill in what has been omitted. The editor's job,
      after all, is to remove obstacles, not to create new ones. For my own abbreviations: since I
      have such mouth- and line-filling names for Lady Mary and for her husband, I designate them as
      M and as W. But there I draw the line. Where sensible and useful, the editor can use short
      cuts. The letters, for example, can be assigned numbers, and these can then be used for cross
      references. If the letter-numbers are printed as shoulder-notes on each page, they can easily
      be found by the reader.</p>

     <p>The freedom and elasticity of footnotes are a great temptation to a vivacious editor. He can
      fill them with materials for his autobiography as a scholar, telling us how and where he has
      searched, whom solicited, why failed, when succeeded, and so on. His acknowledgments belong in
      the prefatory material; after page one the reader is concerned not with the editor but with
      the letter-writer. A simple rule for avoiding editorial exhibitionism is to avoid the first
      person pronoun. Besides cozy footnote chats, the editor will be tempted into sly quips and
      oblique jokes; and this should also be resisted. The editor, in short, should practise the
      most extreme self-effacement in favor of the letter-writer.</p>

     <p>I hope I do not seem to be in favor of erasing the editor. I wish, on the contrary, to
      restore to him the function stated in Dr. Johnson's definition: "he that revises or prepares
      any work for publication." The editor, as I see him, should be discriminating as to what goes
      into the edition and also as to what belongs in the text and in the annotations. He should
      prepare his text in such a way as to make it faithful to his manuscript and at the same time
      serviceable to his readers; he should arrange his annotations and apparatus in a simple, lucid
      form.</p>

     <p>Earlier in this paper I made a distinction between letter-writers and writers of letters.
      Perhaps this gap can be narrowed if we print <pb n="011.037"/> more letters as though they
      were worth reading for their own sake. Unless we print letters in such a form as to allow them
      to be read as widely as possible and with ease and pleasure we are in danger of creating a
      coterie scholarship, when we will only read each other's footnotes; and the ranks of
      monumental editions will, in truth, be only monuments.</p>

     <p>If I seem reactionary in advocating a return to the nineteenth-century concept of readable
      editions, I hope it is still progress&mdash;on a spiral, so to speak; for we can also make our
      texts accurate and our annotations full and scholarly.</p>

     <p>Is this possible? you may well ask. I hold here the first volume of the new edition, in the
      Pl&eacute;iade series, of Madame de S&eacute;vign&eacute;'s letters. In several respects it is
      more radical than I have outlined: the notes, of exemplary brevity and directness, are in the
      back of the volume, and the spelling, punctuation, and capitalization are normalized. (The
      text is for the most part based not on the writer's own manuscripts, which do not survive, but
      on a later transcript.) While it is both scholarly and complete, it is at the same time
      attractively made and invitingly readable.</p>

     <p>"Mon cousin," she once wrote to Bussy-Rabutin, "s'il vous prend fantaisie un jour de publier
      mes lettres, je vous prie de les corriger." He answered, "Ma cousine, on ne corrige pas le
      Titien." (But he did.) If today we do not believe in correcting our Titians, we as editors
      should at least clean, frame, and light them for all to see and enjoy.</p>

     <p>IT HAS GENERALLY BEEN ASSUMED AS "VIRTUALLY axiomatic" that the pages of hand-set books of
      the sixteenth century were composed in seriatim order in first editions.<ref
       target="f011.03.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref> Moxon had suggested to be sure that
      casting-off manuscript copy and setting by formes were possibilities, but his tone intimated
      that the phenomenon was both troublesome and of infrequent occurrence.<ref target="f011.03.02"
       n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref> Dr. William Bond in 1948 advanced the tentative
      hypothesis based on line-counts that setting by formes did occur in sixteenth-century quartos
      and octavos.<ref target="f011.03.03" n="3"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref> More recently Dr.
      Charlton Hinman has irrefutably demonstrated that the Shakespeare First Folio was regularly
      set by formes.<ref target="f011.03.04" n="4"><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref> In this paper I
      shall argue that setting by formes in quarto printing was a more common occurrence than has
      been thought.</p>





     <p>The evidence for this theory is derived from the sufficiency and deficiency of particular
      characters from a given font in a given text. It is based on two observations: (1) the count
      of type-pieces of a character as they appear in a sheet or a forme, and (2) the presence of
      substitutions for the character which indicate that the supply of the character has been
      exhausted in the course of the work.</p>

     <p>A few difficulties must be admitted and a few cautions mentioned at the outset. Not all
      substitutions point perforce to the exhaustion of the proper character, and insignificant
      substitutions must be distinguished from significant ones. Studies of type shortage should
      depend on prior compositorial analysis. Differences in compositors or differences in their
      cases can obscure or invalidate the results of any findings. <pb n="011.040"/> Often the
      evidence is not really comprehensible; presumably the human element has intervened.
      Occasionally the compositor, knowing that he would run short of a character, seems to have
      saved his characters for use in prominent locations, mixed his proper and his improper sorts
      indiscriminately, or distributed his wrought-off pages in an unpredictable time sequence. Some
      substitutions may have been used to assist in justifying lines without regard to the supply or
      shortage of the proper character. Difficulties also exist in tracing shortages through the
      successive sheets of a quarto; characters in demand in one sheet are often not needed in
      another so that a continuing pattern is not attainable. But in spite of all these
      difficulties, the method is serviceable in some cases, as the following examples will make
      clear. Those presented first were all set from the same font of type by the same compositor
      working in the shop of Thomas Creede between 1593 and 1599.<ref target="f011.03.05" n="5"><hi
        rend="super">5</hi></ref></p>


     <p>The first example of this investigation is found in the <hi rend="italic">Epicedium: A
       Funeral Song upon the Death of the Lady Helen Branch</hi> (STC 12751), printed by Creede in
      1594, one of the first works to be issued from his newly established shop. The <hi
       rend="italic">Epicedium</hi> is a single-sheet quarto comprising 144 lines of verse, printed
      in roman type of a size approximating to modern pica (20 ll. 84 mm.). This particular font of
      type was apparently not supplied with the characters for lowercase and upper-case 'w' in
      sufficient quantity for this particular job, and the supplies of those characters were
      exhausted during the setting of the sheet. The place of the lower-case character was then
      filled with 'vv', and the place of the upper-case character with 'VV' &mdash; substitutions
      common enough in the period. The following table lists the incidence of 'w', 'vv' and 'W',
      'VV' in the sheet: <table>

      <pb n="011.041"/> The lower-case character was required 114 times in the sheet. On 83
      instances the 'w' was set in the proper fashion, but on 31 instances on pages A1 and A3 the
      substitute 'vv' was used in its place. The upper-case character was required 23 times in the
      sheet. On 21 instances the 'W' was set in the proper fashion, but on two instances on page A3
      the substitute 'VV' was used in its place.</p>

     <p>I have suggested that before drawing any conclusions from the appearance and disappearance
      of a character, we must be aware of the compositorial situation before us. But in any given
      problem we must also be satisfied as to the reactions of the compositor in one particular. In
      this example we must know the compositor's attitude toward 'w' and 'vv'. On signature A3 where
      both forms of both characters occur, the dividing lines between the proper and the substitute
      forms are distinct; the proper forms appear at the top of the page and the substitute forms
      follow them.<ref target="f011.03.06" n="6"><hi rend="super">6</hi></ref> We may reasonably
      infer from this fact that the compositor was not indifferent to the <hi rend="italic"
       >w/vv</hi> distinction. He obviously used the proper character until he had no more. We may
      have some confidence, then, in believing that when this compositor set the upper- or
      lower-case 'vv' form, he did so because his supply of the proper sort was exhausted, and we
      may conclude that in the <hi rend="italic">Epicedium</hi> the substitution is significant.<ref target="f011.03.07" n="7"><hi rend="super">7</hi></ref></p>



     <p>It seems reasonable to suppose that the compositor began his type-setting with a supply of
      the 'w' character in his cases. It follows then if the compositor was careful in this matter
      &mdash; and we have just seen that he was &mdash; that the sufficiency of the character should
      appear at the beginning of the work and the shortage of the character and its substitution at
      the end of the work. From the evidence of the shortage of 'w' and 'W', we may conclude that
      pages A2, A2<hi rend="super">v</hi>, A3<hi rend="super">v</hi>, and A4, which exhibit a
      sufficient supply of the character were composed before pages A3 and A1, which by the use of
      the substitution exhibit an insufficient supply. An order of setting in which A3<hi
       rend="super">v</hi> and A4 precede A3 and A1 is comprehensible only if we assume that the
      compositor was setting by formes, the inner forme preceding the outer: <table>

      <pb n="011.042"/> This rearrangement by formes reveals a sufficiency of the 'w' and 'W'
      characters for all the pages of the inner forme, A1<hi rend="super">v</hi> (a blank), A2,
       A3<hi rend="super">v</hi>, and A4 &mdash; and for the first page of the outer forme, A2<hi
       rend="super">v</hi>. Three more 'w' forms and three more 'W' forms appear in the upper
      section of A3, but the substitutions for these characters occur throughout the rest of the
      page. The 'vv' substitution found on the title page, A1, argues that that page was set last in
      the forme (not unnaturally). Page A4<hi rend="super">v</hi> is a blank. The outer forme thus
      displays the shortage of 'w' in two of its pages and must therefore have been set after the
      inner.</p>

     <p>Two objections to the theory of setting by formes for this quarto come at once to mind: the
      possibility of a distribution of type after page A3, and the difficulty of casting-off copy so
      as to set pages out of normal consecutive order. As to the first, a distribution of type in
      the midst of a work as small as the <hi rend="italic">Epicedium</hi> would have been
       improbable.<ref target="f011.03.08" n="8"><hi rend="super">8</hi></ref> Furthermore, such an
      argument cannot logically explain the presence of the 'vv' on the title page. As to the
      difficulty of casting-off copy, there is none. The verse is in twelve-line stanzas which are
      set three to a page. There could have been no difficulty in counting off the number of stanzas
      and setting them out of their seriatim order. Neither of these objections is of any genuine
      concern in the present example, and we may safely conclude on the basis of the evidence of
      type shortage in the pages of the outer forme that the quarto was set by formes, the inner
      preceding and the outer succeeding.</p>


     <p>Another work printed by Creede which made heavy demands on this font was <hi rend="italic"
       >The First Part of the Contention betwixt the Two Famous Houses of Yorke and Lancaster</hi>
      (STC 26099), issued in 1594. In this quarto shortages occur frequently. Most conspicuous is
      the shortage of lower-case 'w', though there seems for this play to have been a sufficiency of
      the upper-case 'W'. Shortages in the associated italic font are also evident, but they seem to
      present no clear pattern. Random mixing of roman and italic forms of 'k', 'K', 'S', and 'Q'
      and the substitutions of '<hi rend="italic">VV</hi>' and 'W' for the proper '<hi rend="italic"
       >W</hi>' (of which only three pieces seem to exist) are common in the quarto and are without
       <pb n="011.043"/> significance. The shortage of lower-case 'w', on the other hand, discloses
      a pattern throughout the quarto.</p>

     <p>An ample supply of the character was available for most of the pages of sheet A: <table>

      the proper character; on A4 the supply was exhausted at the bottom of the page, and A4<hi
       rend="super">v</hi> was set with the 'vv' substitution entirely. The division between the 'w'
      and the 'vv' forms is a clean one, the 'w' forms appearing at the top of the page, the 'vv'
      forms at the bottom. Such a pattern argues here for seriatim composition of sheet A beginning
      with A2 (A1<hi rend="super">v</hi> blank). At the same time the evidence of the single 'vv' on
      A1, the title page, suggests that that page was composed last, after A4<hi rend="super">v</hi>

      </table> This rearrangement suggests that after the composition of B3 the type used in earlier
      press-work was distributed and the cases were restocked. <pb n="011.044"/> Once more the
      divisions of 'w' and 'vv' on the two pages, B3 and B3<hi rend="super">v</hi>, on which both

     <p>Corroborating evidence for a distribution after B3 and for the font depletion on B4 exists
      in the appearance of substitutions for 'W' and for 'I'. Near the bottom of B3, just one line
      above the first of the 'vv' substitutions, occurs the unique example of 'VV' in the quarto. It
      indicates that the supply of 'W' &mdash; like the supply of 'w' &mdash; has been exhausted at
      that point. Similarly at the bottom of B4 occur eight italic '<hi rend="italic">I</hi>'
      substitutions for the correct roman 'I'. Since they occur in the last appearances of the
      character in the forme, they indicate that the font has been depleted and that the supply of
      the proper roman character has been exhausted.</p>

     <p>Sheet C exhibits the shortage of 'w' in signatures 3<hi rend="super">v</hi> and 4, the last
      pages of the sheet to be composed. Sheets D and E exhibit the shortages in 4<hi rend="super"
       >v</hi>. Hence we may conclude that 4<hi rend="super">v</hi> was the last page to be composed
      in sheets D and E and that the composition of these sheets was therefore probably seriatim.
      This conjecture involves certain assumptions, chief among which is this that the compositor
      was well in advance of his press at the beginning of sheet D. That this assumption is correct
      and that the compositor was not only ahead but was gaining on his press are indicated by the
      evidence for the distribution of type and the restocking of the cases. Thus it would seem that
      one forme was distributed and the supply of 'w' replenished before E1 was set (after depletion
      on D4<hi rend="super">v</hi>), one forme was distributed before F1<hi rend="super">v</hi> was
      set (after depletion on F1), and one forme was distributed before G2 was set (after depletion
      on G1<hi rend="super">v</hi>). The progression from one to one-verso to two suggests that the
      compositor was able to set the sheets of this quarto faster than his press could print them,
      for the delivery and the distribution of the wrought-off forme come increasingly later in the
      composition period.</p>

     <p>Sheet H presents two difficulties in interpreting the <hi rend="italic">w/vv</hi> pattern.
      The appearance of five 'w' forms on sig. H1 is not readily explicable. The pattern of
      deficiency and sufficiency for H3<hi rend="super">v</hi> is unique in the quarto. The page
      begins with a single 'w' form; this is followed by six 'vv' forms; and these by thirteen 'w'
      forms. It is arguable that the supply of 'w' was exhausted at the top of the page and that the
      compositor then turned to his substitution ('vv') for six settings. At this moment the type of
      a forme released by the press was distributed, and the cases were restocked. The compositor
      was thus able to finish sheet H with the proper 'w' character as he had begun it.</p>

     <p>The fresh supplies of 'w' available for pages B1, B4<hi rend="super">v</hi>, C1, D1, E1,
       F1<hi rend="super">v</hi>, and G2 testify to a distribution of an earlier forme at the
      beginnings of these pages. The appearance of eight substitutions of '<hi rend="italic">I</hi>'
      for 'I' at the bottom of B4 and of two at the bottom of F1, and the resumption of the proper
      form on C1 and F1<hi rend="super">v</hi> respectively, confirm the fact that the font was
      depleted at those points.<ref target="f011.03.12" n="12"><hi rend="super">12</hi></ref> The
      appearance of six substitutions of '<hi rend="italic">A</hi>' for 'A' in the middle of D2<hi
       rend="super">v</hi> suggests an exhaustion and a restocking on that page.<ref

      <note>(Argument for distribution after C4<hi rend="super">v</hi>, E3, F3, G3 is hypothetical;
       argument for distribution on D2<hi rend="super">v</hi> is based on shortage of 'A'. Argument

       by shortage of 'I'. Distribution occurs in the middle of D2<hi rend="super">v</hi> and H3<hi
        rend="super">v</hi>, not after those pages.)</note>
     </p>
     <p>The preceding table indicates a high degree of correlation between the number of pieces
      released and the number of pieces utilized. Thus between pages E3 and F1, 72 'w' pieces are
      used; these are supplied by the distribution of D outer &mdash; containing 77 pieces &mdash;
      at the end of E3. Between G3 and G4<hi rend="super">v</hi>, 66 pieces are used; these are
      supplied by the distribution of F outer yielding 72 pieces. Sheets A and B derive their supply
      from initially full cases and from distribution of earlier press-work. Sheets C and E made
      extraordinary demands on the font. The fact that the shortages of 'w' do not appear in the
      earlier pages of these two sheets indicates that some extra pieces of the sort must have been
      added to the font during the composition of both sheets.<ref target="f011.03.14" n="14"><hi
        rend="super">14</hi></ref></p>


     <p>The analysis of the shortage of 'w' in the <hi rend="italic">Contention</hi> has presented
      an hypothesis for the order of the pages in the sheets and for the formes in the press. The
      appearance of a pattern of generally predictable depletion and distribution of the 'w'
      character in the play corroborates an argument for a single set of cases and for a single
      compositor and allows a conjecture as to the speed and the facility of the compositor.</p>

     <p>The <hi rend="italic">Menechmi</hi> (STC 20002), printed by Creede in 1595, offers an
      informative example of the compositor's solution to another problem of deficiency of type,
      this time in the italic font associated with the roman font under discussion. This English
      translation of the Plautine comedy exhibits a shortage of italic capital '<hi rend="italic"
       >M</hi>'. This shortage is not occasioned by normal demands of the text on an inadequate
      font; rather is it the result of abnormal demands of the text on an adequate font. It is this
      compositor's practice to set speech prefixes and proper names in the text in italic, and as
      the play includes the characters of the Menechmi, Messenio, Mulier, and Medicus, and as
      mention is <pb n="011.047"/> made of Moschus, the need for the italic '<hi rend="italic"
       >M</hi>' is frequent. The supply of the letter is exhausted early in the composition, and the
      roman capital is substituted for the italic.</p>

     <p>The substituted pieces in this play are not divided from the proper pieces by the clear
      lines of demarcation that we have noticed in the preceding examples. On the contrary there
      appears after the first few pages a complete indifference to the distinctions between italic
      and roman capital 'M'. It is evident that the compositor's solution (a common one) has been to
      distribute italic and roman pieces of the capital 'M' into the same box indiscriminately and
      to use them thereafter without any regard to proper style. It is possible, however, by
      counting the number of italic pieces on each page to determine the proportion of italic to
      substituted roman. These ratios show clearly that in the pages of the outer formes there are

     <p>The last line of the table contains the ratio of pieces by formes. The figure to the left of
      the virgule represents the number of italic pieces in the forme, that to the right the number
      of roman pieces. Thus we have in sheets B, C, and D, a high proportion of italic in the outer
      and precedent formes, a low proportion of italic in the inner and subsequent formes. It would
      seem, furthermore, that the supply and the proportion of italic '<hi rend="italic">M</hi>'
      used for setting each forme were derived from the distribution of the comparable forme of the
      immediately preceding sheet. So we note that the twelve italic '<hi rend="italic">M</hi>'
      pieces used in sheet B inner are reused (and no others) in sheet C inner; the 37 italic pieces
      in sheet D outer are reused (and no others) in sheet E outer.</p>

     <pb n="011.048"/>

     <p>The outer forme of sheet E evidently parallels the outer formes of sheets B, C, and D, for
      it shares the same relatively high proportion of italic pieces. But the inner forme of sheet E
      offers figures that are entirely disproportionate to all other inner formes, and that resemble
      in fact much more the figures of the outer formes. On the other hand the pages of half-sheet F
      exhibit, where we should expect figures correlative to the outer forme, figures exactly
      correlative to the inner formes. The situation would be explained by supposing the composition
      of half-sheet F prior to the composition of the inner forme of sheet E. When this
      rearrangement is made, the resulting figures are found to be perfectly regular and in keeping
      with the rest of the quarto.</p>

     <p>The hypothesis is a curious one and would hardly be tenable were it not that the analysis of
      the running titles proves that after E outer was imposed, half-sheet F was interjected before
      the imposition of E inner.<ref target="f011.03.15" n="15"><hi rend="super">15</hi></ref></p>


     <p>There is an explanation for this phenomenon. The proportions of the mixed font of italic and
      roman 'M' reveal that the compositor was distributing his formes in a regular pattern and was
      managing to keep up with the press. But he was not gaining on the press as he was in the <hi
       rend="italic">Contention</hi>, and any opportunity to save composition time would therefore
      have been welcomed. The composition of half-sheet F was such an opportunity. Half-sheet F
      consisted of two pages of type and two blank pages; these could have been prepared in just
      half the time required for the usual four-page forme. But these two pages required just as
      much time on the press as a full four-page forme. If the compositor was being hurried by the
      press, he could have gained time by setting the two-page forme out of order. Running-title
      evidence and type-shortage evidence combine to argue that this procedure was followed
      here.</p>

     <pb n="011.049"/>

     <p>But the question may well be posed why the compositor in the <hi rend="italic"
       >Contention</hi> was able to gain on his press and in the <hi rend="italic">Menechmi</hi> was
      not. The answer lies in the nature of the texts. The <hi rend="italic">Contention</hi> was a
      public play on a patriotic subject designed for the boards; the <hi rend="italic"
       >Menechmi</hi> was a private play, designed for the closet. It was the first translation of
      Plautus printed in English and was admitted to be a trial venture in the printer's address to
      the reader. There is hardly a need to look for further evidence that the edition was a small
      one. In a small edition press time would be briefer than composition time, and the compositor
      would always be concerned lest he fall behind and so delay his press.<ref target="f011.03.16"
       n="16"><hi rend="super">16</hi></ref></p>


     <p><hi rend="italic">The Comicall Historie of Alphonsus</hi>, <hi rend="italic">King of
       Aragon</hi> (STC 12233), printed by Creede in 1599, presents yet another solution made by the
      compositor to the problem of a deficiency of type in the italic font used also in the <hi
       rend="italic">Menechmi</hi>. The normal practice of the compositor is to set all proper names
      in the text in contrasting italic type. In a violation of that practice, proper names of
      persons are set in this play in non-contrasting roman type in the inner formes of sheets B and
      C and in the outer formes of sheets D and E. A closer look discloses that the question is not
      simply one of the setting of personal names, but of the setting of personal names beginning
      with 'A'. The text includes the characters Alphonsus, Albinius, Amurack, and Arcastus, and
      references are frequent to Aragon, Asia, and Africa. It is difficult to avoid the conclusion
      that the shortage of capital italic '<hi rend="italic">A</hi>', induced by the excessive need
      for the character, is closely related to the failure to use italic for personal names, first
      for personal names beginning with 'A' and thence for all personal names. It is on sig. B2 that
      the shortage of italic '<hi rend="italic">A</hi>' is first apparent, and it is on the same
      page that personal names are first set in roman type. Thereafter the shortage of '<hi
       rend="italic">A</hi>' as it appears in the various pages of the sheets clearly argues for
      composition by formes, for the precedence in composition of the outer forme in sheets B and C,
      the inner forme in sheets D through H, and for distribution after each sheet.<ref

      <note>(A few '<hi rend="italic">A</hi>' forms in stage directions are included in line
       "2.")</note>
     </p>

     <pb n="011.051"/>

     <p>Confronted with the problem of an inadequacy of italic '<hi rend="italic">A</hi>', the
      compositor was obliged to find a solution. His solution was to set personal names in italic
      until the supply of italic '<hi rend="italic">A</hi>' began to diminish (<hi rend="italic"
       >i.e.</hi>, after the completion of the first forme of the sheet), then to set such names
      completely in roman in order to avoid the mixture of italic and roman in the same word (the
      mixture is standard in the <hi rend="italic">Menechmi</hi>). Such a decision provided for (1)
      uniformity of font in each word, (2) uniformity of pattern in setting (by including all
      personal names, not merely those beginning in 'A'), and (3) a supply of italic '<hi
       rend="italic">A</hi>' for use in place names and in speech prefixes, where the absence of the
      proper font would be more conspicuous.</p>

     <p>Thus at the beginning of B2, having used 45 italic '<hi rend="italic">A</hi>' forms, the
      compositor was faced with a demand for sixteen more pieces of the character. These he did not
      have, and he was forced to substitute the roman 'A' to make up the deficiency. He set the
      prefixes on the page in italic type but with roman capitals, and he set one word in the text
      in the same "mixed-font" manner. At this point the decision was made to set all personal names
      in roman in the text as the supply of italic '<hi rend="italic">A</hi>' began to diminish, so
      that the lower-case letters would be uniform with the roman capitals, and to reserve the
      italic capitals for the prefixes. The few remaining italic pieces were used for the prefixes
      on B3<hi rend="super">v</hi> and B4, and personal names in the text were set in roman.</p>

     <p>The pattern thus described for sheet B with a preceding forme containing personal names
      fully italicized, a succeeding forme showing signs of shortage of italic '<hi rend="italic"
       >A</hi>' by the use of roman personal names is constant through sheet E. Sheet B required 66
      italic '<hi rend="italic">A</hi>' pieces, and on the basis of this requirement the compositor
      adopted his method for setting the rest of the quarto. The number was above average, for no
      other sheet required so many. The compositor therefore began to abandon the policy in sheet E,
      setting personal names beginning with other letters in italic after E3, and in sheet F setting
      personal names beginning with 'A' in italic even though a roman capital had to be used. Sheet
      F used only eighteen pieces of italic '<hi rend="italic">A</hi>', and as a result sheet G was
      set with only one irregular roman form, doubtless an oversight. The 43 capitals required in
      sheet G induced the usual shortage in sheet H and in turn in sheet I.</p>

     <p>The evidence from type shortage in <hi rend="italic">Alphonsus</hi> tells us the order of
      composition of the formes and indirectly reveals information on a quite different matter, the
      setting of roman type in the place of italic.</p>


     <p>The examples presented thus far have been from a small shop. Though the limited facilities
      of the small shop offer more opportunity <pb n="011.052"/> for evidence of type shortage,
      these examples are not unusual, and exceptional demands of certain texts will cause type
      shortages to appear in works from larger shops as well. One more example from another shop
      will be presented here.</p>

     <p>In his discussion of the "bad" quarto of <hi rend="italic">Romeo and Juliet</hi> (1597) (STC
      22322), Dr. Harry R. Hoppe pointed out that sheets E through K were set by two compositors
      alternating in this manner: <table>

     <p>The pattern of type shortage in the work of Compositor Y is much less clear than that in the
      work of X, though Compositor Y too would <pb n="011.053"/> seem to have set by formes (indeed
      there would be no purpose in having X set by formes and Y set seriatim), because the cases
      used by Y are in several letters more adequately stocked than those used by X, and for other
      letters Y is less concerned to keep his proper type-pieces and his substitutes unmixed. The
      evidence is not so convincing as could be wished, and I hesitate to speculate further.</p>

     <p>The examples that have been presented in this paper have demonstrated the utility of this
      particular sort of investigation in shedding light on mechanical and on compositorial
      practices that offer problems to the bibliographer. Type shortages can often reveal the order
      of composition of the pages of a sheet and the times of distribution; sometimes they can point
      to much more information. As the evidence can be shown to derive from peculiarities of the
      type and from the nonliterary reactions of the compositor and not from any oddity of the copy,
      these instances provide arguments from what is purely bibliographical information.
      Type-shortage evidence should provide a new tool for bibliographical investigation.</p>

       </table> As this order violates the order of imposition and printing as disclosed by the
       running-title evidence and as the witness from '<hi rend="italic">k</hi>' is far from
       dependable in the rest of the quarto, it seems safest to follow the unequivocal and
       consistent evidence of the shortage of 'w'. If one could believe that the single 'vv' on A1
       was the result of influence from the preceding '<hi rend="italic">VV</hi>' and that the title
       page was composed first in the sheet rather than last, this theory would account for the four
       proper '<hi rend="italic">k</hi>' forms on that page. But the presence of the 'vv' &mdash;
       and of the '<hi rend="italic">VV</hi>' too &mdash; would seem to militate against this
       position. Though the shortage of '<hi rend="italic">W</hi>' is not dependable as evidence,
       the presence of the substitute on the first page of the quarto to be set seems unlikely. It
       is of interest to note that the running title for A3 contains the proper italic '<hi
        rend="italic">k</hi>' while that for A4 has the 'k.'</p></note>

       appear in half-sheet F where we should normally have expected them, but they do appear in the

       from an edition already in print by 1594 of which no copies have survived. But this title

       use and delight of [the author's] private friends," for the printer promises further plays of
       Plautus if the <hi rend="italic">Menechmi</hi> receives "courteous acceptance" (sig. A3). As
       no other Plautine comedies were published for another century (Wing lists P-2415 in 1694), it
       would seem unlikely that another edition had preceded Creede's of 1595. Bibliographical

     <p>AS ALICE WALKER RECENTLY EMPHASIZED<ref target="f011.04.01" n="1"><hi rend="super"
       >1</hi></ref>, THE study of the ways of compositors in spelling and other usages in
      Shakespearian texts may help to shed light on their "metamorphosis into print", and a
      knowledge of the compositors' habits at each stage of their work in the First Folio is useful
      as filling out a picture from which generalisations may at some time be drawn. The following
      remarks on the Folio text of <hi rend="italic">Henry VIII</hi> may then have some general
      interest. As far as this play is concerned, they support the conclusion of W. W. Greg<ref
       target="f011.04.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref> that the text derived from a
      "carefully edited" fair copy, and they suggest further that it was in a single hand.
      Discussion of the play has been complicated by the question of authorship, a bogy which arose
      in the nineteenth century,<ref target="f011.04.03" n="3"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref> and has
      troubled editors and critics ever since. These have usually divided the play between Fletcher
      and Shakespeare, and a distinction between the work of the two compositors who set the Folio
      text also has a direct bearing upon this.</p>




     <p>The well-known main differences in the spelling used by Jaggard A and Jaggard B, the
      compositors who between them set most of the Folio in type,<ref target="f011.04.04" n="4"><hi
        rend="super">4</hi></ref> reveal a clear division of labour in the text of <hi rend="italic"

      "year" (5 times set by A, 2 by B), and "devil" (3 by A, 4 by B), which always have the same

      some plays, or not in sufficient number to provide certain evidence, offer a clear distinction
      between the work of the compositors in <hi rend="italic">Henry VIII</hi>. The habits of the

      </table> One further piece of evidence is afforded by the brief appearance on the stage of Dr
      Butts, the King's physician, in V.ii. His name occurs 8 times in speech-headings and in the
      text, and it so happens that these are distributed between x2<hi rend="super">v</hi>, set by
      B, and x3<hi rend="super">r</hi>, set by A; B spells the name "Buts" (5 times), and A spells
      it "Butts" (3 times).</p>

     <p>The shares of the text which fell to the two compositors in no way correspond to the shares
      often assigned by critics to the two authors, Shakespeare and Fletcher. The most compelling
      arguments for dual authorship have been assembled by A. C. Partridge,<ref target="f011.04.08"
       n="8"><hi rend="super">8</hi></ref> who has reaffirmed <pb n="011.058"/> the division
      proposed by Spedding, allocating to Shakespeare I.i and ii; II.iii and iv; III.ii.1-203; and
      V.i. The rest of the play he assigns to Fletcher, offering as his main evidence the occurrence
      of forms which Fletcher habitually used (notably <hi rend="italic">'em</hi>, for <hi
       rend="italic">them</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">ye</hi>) predominantly in this part. He found
      59 examples of the use of <hi rend="italic">'em</hi> in the section ascribed to Fletcher, as
      compared with 5 in that ascribed to Shakespeare, and 72 examples of <hi rend="italic">ye</hi>,
      as compared with only 2 in Shakespeare's part. One <hi rend="italic">'em</hi> crept into this
      total through an emendation of the Folio text, but allowing for this, the forms are spread
      across the work of the two compositors to the following extent: <hi rend="italic">'em</hi>
      appears 12 times in the work of B, 51 times in the work of A; <hi rend="italic">ye</hi>
      appears 24 times in the work of B, 48 times in the work of A. The spread is uneven, partly
      because A set many more than B of the lines ascribed to Fletcher,<ref target="f011.04.09"
       n="9"><hi rend="super">9</hi></ref> partly, as Philip Williams Jr. pointed out,<ref
       target="f011.04.10" n="10"><hi rend="super">10</hi></ref> because A, as was his habit, no
      doubt reproduced his copy more literally than B, who may have normalized a number of these
      forms.</p>




     <p>Another feature of the text of <hi rend="italic">Henry VIII</hi> is interesting because it
      seems to be unrelated either to the division between the work of the compositors, or to the
      postulated division between authors. The speech-headings for certain characters vary in what
      appears to be an inconsequential manner. Some minor variations, such as the change from <hi
       rend="italic">Qu.</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Quee(n).</hi> in the early scenes to <hi
       rend="italic">Kath.</hi> in IV.ii signify little. In one case the variation is important
      because it causes confusion between characters; the Lord Chamberlain, who appears earlier in
      the play as <hi rend="italic">L. Ch.</hi> becomes <hi rend="italic">Cham</hi>. in V.ii, where,
      as a result, there is confusion between him and the Lord Chancellor (<hi rend="italic"
       >Chan.</hi>), and the Folio gives to <hi rend="italic">Cham.</hi> speeches which, as Capell
      noted, belong to the Lord Chancellor, who is conducting the business of the Council in this
      scene. The most significant variations, however, are those in the speech-headings used for
      Wolsey.<ref target="f011.04.11" n="11"><hi rend="super">11</hi></ref> He figures first as <hi
       rend="italic">Car(d).</hi> in the work of both compositors, but on v1<hi rend="super">v</hi>
      (II.ii), after the entry, "Enter Wolsey and Campeius with a commission", the heading changes
      to <hi rend="italic">Wol.</hi>. On this page, the work of A, the new heading may have been
      introduced by transference from the name in the entry. The next page contains no speeches by
      Wolsey, who returns on v2<hi rend="super">v</hi>, (II.iv), for which B was responsible, first
      as <hi rend="italic">Car.</hi> (II.iv.1, 5), then as <hi rend="italic">Wol.</hi> (l. 55ff.);
      here there is no mention of his name in the <pb n="011.059"/> text to suggest such change. The
      next two pages, the work of A again, have both <hi rend="italic">Card.</hi> and <hi
       rend="italic">Wol(s).</hi>. Then follows a longish stretch of text set by B; on v4<hi
       rend="super">r</hi>, v4<hi rend="super">v</hi>, and v5<hi rend="super">r</hi>, only <hi
       rend="italic">Car(d).</hi> is used, until again at III.ii.252, and for a few later speeches
      on v5<hi rend="super">v</hi>, the heading <hi rend="italic">Wol.</hi> recurs, again for no
      discernible reason. On all except the first page on which <hi rend="italic">Wol.</hi> appears
       (v1<hi rend="super">v</hi>), the two forms alternate on the same page, and the intrusion of
       <hi rend="italic">Wol.</hi> cannot be explained as a transference from the text, or by a
      shortage of italic capital <hi rend="italic">C</hi>, which abounds throughout the play, in
      speech-headings for the Chamberlain, the Chancellor, Cromwell, and Cranmer, as well as in
      stage directions.</p>


     <p>This variation in speech-headings cannot then be related to compositors. Since it extends
      across scenes ascribed both to Fletcher (II.ii; III.i; III.ii.204ff.), and to Shakespeare
      (II.iv; III.ii.1-203), it cannot be linked with the theory of dual authorship. It is safe to
      assume that it was in the copy from which the compositors worked and a little may be added to
      W. W. Greg's conclusion that "The copy for F was clearly a carefully prepared manuscript, in
      whose hand or hands there is no evidence to show. It could have been used as a prompt-book,
      but there is no indication that it was."<ref target="f011.04.12" n="12"><hi rend="super"
        >12</hi></ref> It seems likely that the manuscript was in a single hand. The printed text is
      very clean, and, except for variations in spelling and usage for which the scribe was not
      responsible, consistently good. Its general appearance, the very full and elaborately set-out
      stage directions and entries, and the full division into acts and scenes, indicate fair copy.
      The mixed speech-headings, unless two writers are postulated who both used the same ones, also
      seem to point to a single scribe, who failed to regularize, or only partially regularized,
      what he found in the papers from which he copied, and, perhaps, suggest a single author. There
      seem to be no changes in spelling or usage of the kind which Philip Williams Jr. observed in
      the text of <hi rend="italic">I Henry VI</hi>,<ref target="f011.04.13" n="13"><hi rend="super"
        >13</hi></ref> and which might indicate a change in manuscript copy. One small detail lends
      further support; the name "Gilbert Pecke" occurs twice in the text, at I.i.219, in a scene by
      Shakespeare, and at II.i.20, in a scene ascribed to Fletcher. This is almost certainly a
      mistake for or an alteration of Holinshed's "Gilbert Perke"; and since the historian is
      elsewhere followed closely with respect to names, and the change here is pointless, it is safe
      to assume that the author (s) wrote "Perke", which the scribe misread as "Pecke". However the
      form arose, it must have been written in the same way at the two places where it appeared in
      the manuscript from which the text was set. With regard to the origin of the copy, the
      variations in speech-headings <pb n="011.060"/> which give rise to the confusion noted above
      between <hi rend="italic">Cham.</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Chan.</hi> in V.ii, and could cause
      difficulty in III.i., where <hi rend="italic">Car(d).</hi> might represent either of the two
      cardinals (Wolsey and Campeius) on stage, afford contributory evidence towards the supposition
      that the copy stemmed from foul papers. Greg's statement on the play may be modified to this
      extent; that the copy for the Folio <hi rend="italic">Henry VIII</hi> was a carefully prepared
      manuscript, probably in a single hand; there is no indication that it was used as a
      prompt-book, whereas there is evidence from variations in speech-headings and the confusion
      these might occasion in the theatre, to suggest that it was based on foul papers.</p>



     <p>A study of the habits of the compositors in the text of <hi rend="italic">Henry VIII</hi>
      thus offers not only further examples of their differences in usage and spelling, but also
      some evidence bearing on the transmission of the text, and on the authorship problem.</p>

     <head/>
     <p>BECAUSE THE FIRST PRINTED TEXT OF <hi rend="italic">THE TWO Noble Kinsmen</hi>, the quarto
      of 1634, preserves a number of manifest signs of prompt annotation, it has been assumed that
      the printer's copy was a prompt book, and specifically the prompt book that the King's company
      used for a revival of the play which apparently took place in the middle 1620's. In the notes
      to his edition of the play in <hi rend="italic">The Shakespeare Apocrypha</hi> (1908), C. F.
      Tucker Brooke said that the "text is based upon the prompter's stage copy, as we know from the
      S.D.D. to I.iii.68, I.v.28, &amp;c." (p. 434). In <hi rend="italic">William Shakespeare</hi>
      (1930), Sir Edmund Chambers remarked that "evidently the manuscript had been used as
      prompt-copy" (I, 529), and in an article published in 1945, Sir Walter Greg stated that the
      quarto "shows unmistakable signs of having been set up from the very prompt-book used by the
      King's company."<ref target="f011.05.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref> In his latest
      work Greg adds that Q was "evidently printed from a prompt-copy written or at least annotated
      by Edward Knight, book-keeper in the King's company" (<hi rend="italic">The Shakespeare First
       Folio</hi> [1955], p. 98).</p>


     <p>But a close examination of the basic text of the play suggests that the case may not be
      quite so simple: whereas the printed text does show unmistakable signs of the prompter's hand
      in marginal warning notes and in actors' names, it also exhibits certain other textual
      peculiarities that point to foul papers. If so, then the printer's copy for Q would constitute
      annotated foul papers, a species of manuscript which Greg has elsewhere inferred from what
      appears to be the original draft of Heywood's <hi rend="italic">The Captives</hi>. Heywood's
      autograph manuscript bears elaborate prompt annotations in another hand, but since both hands
      are too foul for prompt copy, <pb n="011.062"/>
      <q>the inference is that in this case the book-keeper did his work of stage adaptation on the
       author's foul papers with a view to having a transcript made for the prompter presumably by
       another hand. That would be the natural procedure unless the book-keeper were himself, like
       Knight, something of a calligrapher, which the annotator of <hi rend="italic">The
        Captives</hi> clearly was not . . . . Clearly foul papers annotated by the book-keeper are
       one of the types of manuscript we shall have to take into account (<hi rend="italic"
        >ibid.</hi>, p. 109).</q> And in a note, Greg adds, "If the inference here made is correct,
      the important conclusion follows that a printed text that shows distinctive marks of the
      prompter may yet have been printed from foul papers."</p>

     <p>The "distinctive marks of the prompter" shown in the <hi rend="italic">Kinsmen</hi> do not
      seem to have been introduced for the original production. Scholars are now generally agreed
      that the play was written in 1613. The date is primarily established by the use in a morris
      dance in the play of the same characters who constitute the cast for the second anti-masque of
      Beaumont's <hi rend="italic">Masque of the Inner Temple and Gray's Inn</hi>, presented at
      Whitehall on February 20, 1613. There is, however, no external reference to the play's first
      performance; the first which occurs appears on a scrap of paper from the Revels Office
      probably dating about 1619, and seems to indicate consideration for court performance.<ref
       target="f011.05.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref> The prompter's notes belong to a
      revival of 1625 or 1626; two actors he cast as minor characters were employed by the company
      together during those years only. The pertinent directions are printed as follows<ref
       target="f011.05.03" n="3"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref>: <q><hi rend="italic">Enter
        Messengers. Curtis</hi>. (IV.ii.72, sig. I4<hi rend="super">v</hi>)</q>
      <q>Scaena 3. <hi rend="italic">Enter Theseus, Hipolita, Emilia, Perithous: and some
        Attendants, T. Tucke: Curtis</hi>. (V.iii, sig. L4<hi rend="super">v</hi>)</q> "<hi
       rend="italic">Curtis</hi>" has been identified as Curtis Greville, an actor who left the Lady
      Elizabeth's men for the Palsgrave's company in 1622 and had joined the King's men by the fall
      of 1626, when his name appeared in the cast of <hi rend="italic">The Roman Actor</hi>,
      licensed October 11; Bentley suggests he probably joined the King's company in 1625 at the
      time of the reorganization of the companies.<ref target="f011.05.04" n="4"><hi rend="super"
        >4</hi></ref> "T. Tucke" is evidently an abbreviation for Thomas Tuckfield, whose name
      appears twelfth in the list of "Musitions and other necessary attendantes" of the company,
      whom Sir Henry Herbert exempted from arrest on December 27, 1624.<ref target="f011.05.05"
       n="5"><hi rend="super">5</hi></ref>
      <pb n="011.063"/>
      <hi rend="italic">The Two Noble Kinsmen</hi> provides the only record of his appearance on the
      stage; and since his name is not in the full list of actors printed with <hi rend="italic">The
       Roman Actor</hi>, it has been assumed that he was not with the company when that play was
      performed in 1626. Greville and Tuckfield were members of the company together, therefore, for
      no more than two years, and in view of the severity of the plague through most of 1625, a
      revival of the <hi rend="italic">Kinsmen</hi> in the winter of 1625 or spring of 1626 seems
      likeliest. As shall be shown in a moment, the inferior limit is also confirmed by the marginal
      warnings.</p>





     <p>The warning notes are printed in the outside margins of verso and recto pages, in small
      roman type; also so printed is one instance of what appears to be an authorial direction: <list>
       <item>1. "2. Hearses rea-/dy with Pala-/mon: and Arci-/te: the 3. / Queenes. / Theseus: and /
        his Lordes / ready." (I.iii.58 ff., sig. C3<hi rend="super">v</hi>)</item>

       <item>2. "3. Hearses rea-/dy." (I.iv.26, sig. C4<hi rend="super">v</hi>)</item>

       <item>3. "This short flo-/rish of Cor-/nets and / Showtes with-/in." (II.v, opposite opening
        stage-direction, sig. E4<hi rend="super">v</hi>)</item>

       <item>4. "Cornets in / sundry places. / Noise and / hallowing as / people a May-/ing."
        (III.i, opposite act division, sig. F2)</item>

       <item>5. "Chaire and / stooles out." (III.v.64-65, sig. G2<hi rend="super">v</hi>)</item>

       <item>6. "Knocke for / Schoole. Enter / The Dance." (III.v.137-39, sig. G3<hi rend="super"
         >v</hi>)</item>

       <item>7. "They bow se-/verall wayes: / then advance / and stand." (III.vi.93-96, sig. H1<hi
         rend="super">v</hi>)</item>
      </list> In addition, one speech-prefix, "<hi rend="italic">Daughter.</hi>", is printed in the
      left margin, at III.v.60, sig. G2<hi rend="super">v</hi>.</p>

     <p>The first, second, and fifth of these are clearly the prompter's annotations. The
      specification of particular musical instruments and effects in the third and fourth sounds
      like the prompter, while the sixth appears to be the prompter's direction for a signal to
      bring on the morris dance. But the language as well as the substance of the seventh sounds
      authorial. That the direction appears in the left margin may be due to an absence of space in
      the white area to the right of the speeches, although elsewhere the compositors have set long
      directions between lines of speech, as, for example, on the next page. And there is another
      point to be noted: just opposite the first line of the direction, within a line of speech,
      there appears a star or asterisk, as follows: <list>
       <item>They bow severall wayes: then advance and stand.</item>

       <item><hi rend="italic">Arc.</hi> And me my love: * Is there ought else to say?</item>

       <item><hi rend="italic">Pal.</hi> This onely, and no more . . .</item>
      </list> It is difficult to avoid the inference that there is a connection between the
      direction and the star&mdash;that the star is intended to mark the point <pb n="011.064"/>
      where the action specified by the direction is to occur. If so, the direction is probably an
      authorial gloss.<ref target="f011.05.06" n="6"><hi rend="super">6</hi></ref></p>


     <p>It is a fair <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> assumption that all the prompt annotations were
      made at the same time that the actors' names were introduced into the text, by the same hand;
      and there is some evidence, I think, that this is so in fact. The King's company's book-keeper
      at the time of the revival was probably Edward Knight; his name appears at the head of
      Herbert's protection of 1624, and he is specifically identified as the book-keeper by an entry
      in Herbert's Office Book, dated October 21, 1633. The extant prompt copy of <hi rend="italic"
       >The Honest Man's Fortune</hi>, still bearing Herbert's licence of February 8, 1625, is in
      his hand, and it has been suggested that he took up his duties as book-keeper not long before
      that date.<ref target="f011.05.07" n="7"><hi rend="super">7</hi></ref> Now, all of Knight's
      manuscripts show a distinctive use of colons in name-sequences. His practice may be
      illustrated by a few examples from <hi rend="italic">The Honest Man's Fortune</hi> and <hi
       rend="italic">Believe as you List</hi>, the latter a manuscript in Massinger's hand but
      annotated and prepared for the stage by Knight.<ref target="f011.05.08" n="8"><hi
        rend="super">8</hi></ref> At III.iii.37-39 in the former, an entry in the left margin reads,
       "<hi rend="italic">Ent: Montagne</hi>: / <hi rend="italic">bare: Lamyra</hi>: / <hi
       rend="italic">Lady Orleance</hi>: / <hi rend="italic">Charlot: Viram</hi>:". Or at the head
      of IV.ii, the following: "<hi rend="italic">Ent</hi>: <hi rend="italic">Dubois: Orleance:
       Longauile: Amience</hi>: / .2. <hi rend="italic">Lacqueyes: A Page w<hi rend="super"
       >th</hi></hi> .2. <hi rend="italic">Pistolls</hi>:". A typical example from <hi rend="italic"
       >Believe as you List</hi> is the entry in the left margin at ll. 342-344: "<hi rend="italic"
       >Ent: fflaminius</hi>: / <hi rend="italic">Calistus: Demetri</hi>:". Massinger's own use of
      periods in name-sequences may be illustrated by the direction which Knight's replaces: "<hi
       rend="italic">enter Titus flaminivs. Calistus</hi>. / <hi rend="italic">Demetrius</hi>. 2 <hi
       rend="italic">freedmen</hi>." The cancelled direction is some six lines below Knight's.</p>



     <p>The sequence of names in the first of the <hi rend="italic">Kinsmen's</hi> marginal notes is
      also punctuated with colons, and this feature, as Sir Walter Greg has suggested,<ref
       target="f011.05.09" n="9"><hi rend="super">9</hi></ref> points to the hand of Edward Knight.
      It may be noted, too, that the single sequence of actors' names similarly shows a colon, in
      distinction from the sequence of character names to which it is attached; and in view of the
      probability arising from the date of the <pb n="011.065"/> revival that Knight introduced the
      actors' names, it seems to be a reasonable assumption that the colon here is his.</p>


     <p>The punctuation in part of the direction at the head of I.iv may also be Knight's. The
      entire direction is printed in Q as follows: <q><hi rend="italic">Cornets</hi>.</q>
      <q>Scaena 4. <hi rend="italic">A Battaile strooke withi[n]:</hi>
       <hi rend="italic">Then a Retrait: Florish. Then Enter Theseus (victor) the three Queenes
        meete him, and fall on their faces before him</hi>.</q> The description of the action sounds
      authorial, but the specification of off-stage noises and music in the first line, where the
      colons appear, could very well be the prompter's.<ref target="f011.05.10" n="10"><hi
        rend="super">10</hi></ref> The mid-sentence capitalization of <hi rend="italic">Enter</hi>,
      not duplicated elsewhere in the text, suggests that the words preceding may have been an
      addition.</p>


     <p>Otherwise, the stage-directions in Q are punctuated in what might be called conventional
      fashion, without an unusual use of colons in sequence. It would follow, therefore, that Knight
      did not transcribe the basic copy to which the annotations were made; in other words, the
      prompt annotations must be additions to the original manuscript and not integral parts of it;
      and if the clearly identifiable signs of prompt use are eliminated, it appears that the
      original manuscript may not have been a prompt copy.</p>

     <p>A prompt copy was prepared in 1613, presumably, when the play was written and first
      produced. If this copy was not available when the play was revived, what kind of copy could
      the company archives have supplied Edward Knight when he made his annotations preparatory to
      the revival? Whatever it was, it was this copy with Knight's annotations which John Waterson,
      the publisher, obtained (from the playhouse, presumably<ref target="f011.05.11" n="11"><hi
        rend="super">11</hi></ref>) for his quarto of 1634. Authors' fair copy may be eliminated
      because, first of all, the quarto exhibits too many irregularities for fair copy, either
      authorial or scribal. These will be surveyed in a moment. Secondly, Q shows two distinct
      linguistic habits which correspond to the authorial divisions indicated by other areas of
      evidence &mdash;metrical, stylistic, <hi rend="italic">etc</hi>. The implication of this is
      that an authorial draft in the hands of the two authors lies behind the quarto; a faithful <pb
       n="011.066"/> copyist might preserve the authors' linguistic preferences, but an authorial
      fair copy would be likely to bear the impress of whichever of the collaborators made the copy,
      for it may be supposed that the responsibility of preparing the fair copy would fall to <hi
       rend="italic">one</hi> of the authors, the better that any imperfections resulting from
      divided authorship might be removed. As will be seen, Q bears a number of just such marks of
      jointure. There remain, then, foul papers, probably the likeliest possibility on <hi
       rend="italic">a priori</hi> grounds, or a form of intermediate scribal transcript, a class of
      manuscript Professor Fredson Bowers has recently postulated; such a copy, he suggests, might
      have been prepared from foul papers for "consideration, revision, submission to the censor,
      copying of the parts, or sometimes for marking and cutting in preparation for the final prompt
       copy."<ref target="f011.05.12" n="12"><hi rend="super">12</hi></ref> The characteristics of
      foul papers have been summarized by Greg as follows: <q>. . . loose ends and false starts and
       unresolved confusions in the text, which sometimes reveal themselves as duplications in
       print: next, inconsistency in the designation of characters in directions and prefixes alike,
       and occasionally the substitution of the name of an actor, when the part is written with a
       particular performer in view: lastly, the appearance of indefinite and permissive
       stage-directions, and occasionally of explanatory glosses on the text.<ref
        target="f011.05.13" n="13"><hi rend="super">13</hi></ref></q> According to Professor Bowers,
      however, some of these marks might persist in an intermediate transcript: <q>. . . some
       scribes might attempt to clean up difficulties in the act of transcribing, but unless the
       scribe were the book-keeper himself, it is more probable that he would usually concentrate on
       making a more or less faithful copy of the foul papers before him, and would reproduce many
       of the very authorial characteristics which in printed form are taken as indicating foul
        papers.<ref target="f011.05.14" n="14"><hi rend="super">14</hi></ref></q> Bowers (following
      Hoy) cites the 1647 Folio text of Fletcher's <hi rend="italic">Wife for a Month</hi> as
      perhaps exemplifying such a transcript, because on the one hand the textual tangles the play
      exhibits make it unlikely that a prompt copy stood behind the printed text, and on the other,
      "there is a considerable diminution in some classes, though not in all, of Fletcher's
      linguistic characteristics, which cannot be laid at the door of the printer," but which may be
      due to scribal intervention. Now, the quarto <hi rend="italic">Kinsmen</hi> exemplifies all of
      the stigmata of foul papers listed by Greg except the "substitution of the name of an actor,
      when the part is <pb n="011.067"/> written with a particular performer in view"; but it also
      shows the same kind of evidence for an intervening scribal transcript to which Bowers refers
      above&mdash;that is, in the scenes assigned to Fletcher there is a reduction from his usual
      practice in the number of <hi rend="italic">ye</hi>'s. The problem this represents will be
      discussed in a moment; first, however, the evidence for foul papers.</p>





     <p>So far as the sense of the spoken word is concerned, Q is generally fair. Still, there are a
      number of passages which can hardly represent the authors' final intentions. Many of the
      difficulties in Q are of course compositorial in origin; <hi rend="italic">Clough hee</hi>
      (I.i.20), for example, is probably only a misreading of <hi rend="italic">Chough hore</hi>.
      But there are some obscurities arising from the syntax, which must be, therefore, authorial.
      In I.iii.19-22, the essential meaning is clear enough, but the words must have sorely tried
      the art of the actor who had to read the passage as it stands: <q>
       <l>Or tell of Babes broachd on the Launce, or women</l>
       <l>That have sod their Infants in (and after eate them)</l>
       <l>The brine, they wept at killing 'em; Then if</l>
       <l>You stay to see of us such Spincsters . . . .</l>
      </q> The sentence would be less disturbing if the parenthetical element were transposed to the
      line below, following "killing 'em"; a misplaced marginal or interlinear addition or revision
      might be conjectured, although reconstruction is difficult.</p>

     <p>Part of the trouble with a later passage in the same scene is probably compositorial
      misreading, but the passage remains defective even when the obvious corruptions are corrected.
      In Q, lines 72-82 read as follows: <q>
       <l>. . . her affections (pretty</l>
       <l>Though happely, her careles, were, I followed</l>
       <l>For my most serious decking, had mine eare</l>
       <l>Stolne some new aire, or at adventure humd on</l>
       <l>From misicall Coynadge, why it was a note</l>
       <l>Whereon her spirits would sojourne (rather dwell on)</l>
       <l>And sing it in her slumbers; This rehearsall</l>
       <l>(Which fury-innocent wots well) comes in</l>
       <l>Like old importments bastard, has this end,</l>
       <l>That the true love tweene Mayde, and mayde, may be</l>
       <l>More then in sex individuall.</l>
      </q> "her careles, were," appears to be a misreading of "her careles weare," "humd on" must be
      a variant spelling for "humd one", and "misicall" is an obvious misprint. The emendation for
      "fury-innocent" now generally adopted is Lamb's "eu'ry innocent", although it does not
      satisfactorily <pb n="011.068"/> answer all the questions which arise as to the origin of the
      error. Finally, "comes in Like old importments bastard" not only resists emendation but defies
      sense. The whole passage, which falls in one of the non-Fletcherian scenes, suggests that the
      author had not fully worked out his meaning, nor found adequate expression for it, and had
      written in an almost illegible hand.</p>

     <p>The jumble at I.iv.40-45 is one of the cruxes of the play. It is also in a non-Fletcherian
      scene: <q>
       <l>Since I have knowne frights, fury, friends, beheastes,</l>
       <l>Loves, provocations, zeale, a mistris Taske,</l>
       <l>Desire of liberty, a feavour, madnes,</l>
       <l>Hath set a marke which nature could not reach too</l>
       <l>Without some imposition, sicknes in will</l>
       <l>Or wrastling strength in reason . . . .</l>
      </q>
     </p>

     <p>Another tangle appears at V.iii.85-89, again a non-Fletcherian scene: <q>
       <l>. . . there were no woman</l>
       <l>Worth so composd a Man: their single share,</l>
       <l>Their noblenes peculier to them, gives</l>
       <l>The prejudice of disparity values shortnes</l>
       <l>To any Lady breathing------More exulting?</l>
      </q> As with the passage just above, some improvement may be effected by punctuational
      emendation, but even so the meaning, or a meaning, must be forced from the passage.</p>

     <p>There are other passages nearly as obscure, but these are the worst. In addition to textual
      tangle, there are two evident hiatuses in the play, at V.i.50 and V.iv.77. The former appears
      in print as follows: <q>
       <l>Thou mighty one, that with thy power hast turnd</l>
       <l>Greene Neptu[n]e into purple. 50</l>
       <l>Comets prewarne, whose havocke in vaste Feild</l>
       <l>Vnearthed skulls proclaime . . . .</l>
      </q> And the latter: <q>
       <l>He kept him tweene his legges, on his hind hoofes</l>
       <l>on end he stands 77</l>
       <l>That <hi rend="italic">Arcites</hi> leggs being higher then his head</l>
       <l>Seem'd with strange art to hang . . . .</l>
      </q> In the former, an object for "prewarne", corresponding to "havocke" for "proclaime",
      seems necessary, and all editors following Seward have adopted "whose approach" arbitrarily.
      It is likely that merely illegible <pb n="011.069"/> copy is at fault. Such may also be the
      case in the latter example; it may be conjectured, however, that the fragment of V.iv.77, "on
      end he stands", represents a revision of the four words immediately above in line 76, "on his
      hind hoofes".</p>

     <p>It would seem significant that all the passages cited fall in scenes traditionally assigned
      to Fletcher's collaborator. It is not to be expected, of course, that Fletcher and his
      co-author, whether or not he be Shakespeare, should have necessarily produced scenes of equal
      verbal clarity; indeed, one of the features which is invariably mentioned in discussions of
      the non-Fletcherian parts is their denseness or "knottiness". But such denseness is spoken of
      as a positive characteristic of style and thought, while the trouble with the passages cited
      may almost be described as an absence of style and thought. It would appear, therefore, that
      the copy presented some differences as to the state of finish between the Fletcherian and
      non-Fletcherian parts.</p>

     <p>Q also exhibits a number of defects in the stage-directions. An omission occurs in the
      opening entrance, wherein the names of Pirithous and Artesius are absent. Both characters are
      essential to the ensuing action. The discrimination against Pirithous may be laid to
      compositorial eye-skip, since Theseus's name appears twice in consecutive lines, once
      correctly and once where Pirithous should have been named. While the compositor may have
      overlooked Artesius, it is more likely, especially in view of another omission in a later
      scene, that the dramatist&mdash;the scene is one given to Shakespeare&mdash;had not fully
      planned the action when he wrote the initial stage-direction, or that in his concern with the
      pageantry of the wedding procession, he simply overlooked this minor functionary: Artesius is
      not involved in the action for some 160 lines, when he is directed to go out and gather an
      army.</p>

     <p>The other omission occurs at I.iv, another non-Fletcherian scene. This time the missing
      characters are a Herald and the kinsmen themselves; the latter are apparently to be borne in
      unconscious in the hearses provided by the marginal warning note printed thirty lines earlier
      (see no. 1, above). There is no provision, either, for the attending Lords who, as the
      prompter recognized, should have accompanied Theseus on this triumphal occasion. The omissions
      are too many to make it likely that the compositor is to blame; it rather appears that the
      author was intent on the action which opens the scene, the meeting of Theseus and the three
      Queens (strictly speaking, there is no entry for them either&mdash;only their meeting Theseus
      is specified), and in the moment of composition left the other characters to shift for
      themselves.</p>

     <p>The prompter's specification of Theseus's Lords in the marginal <pb n="011.070"/> note at
      I.iii.58 incidentally reflects upon the adequacy of his manuscript with respect to the
      supernumeraries. In several other entrances, no attendants are indicated, when the
      circumstances clearly require them; for example, in addition to the omission noted above, the
      transport of the dying Arcite in his chair at V.iv.85 is left up to Theseus, Hipolita, and
      Emilia. However, Hipolita and Emilia were Amazons, and Theseus was the kinsman of Hercules.
      Otherwise, Q's stage-directions provide "attendants," "others," or most often, simply
      "&amp;c." A permissive direction also involving a discrepancy between the number of characters
      indicated in the stage-direction and ultimately presented on the stage should be particularly
      noted. It occurs at the beginning of III.v, the scene in which the morris dance drawn from
      Beaumont's masque is performed. Beaumont's original anti-masque called for six women and six
      men, plus a presenter; all had specific roles to play, the women's corresponding to the men's,
      such as He-Fool and She-Fool, He-Baboon and She-Baboon, <hi rend="italic">etc</hi>. There is
      some question whether the parts in the play are exactly parallel to those in the anti-masque,<ref target="f011.05.15" n="15"><hi rend="super">15</hi></ref> 
      but it is certain that in both
      there are supposed to be six couples. When the Schoolmaster, acting as presenter, asks,
      "where's their women?" five respond by name. When he commands, "Couple then And see what's
      wanting", the absence of a sixth, Cicely, is discovered. Her part is eventually taken by the
      Jailer's Daughter, who wanders on the scene a little later. At the very outset, then, there
      are five women on stage; but the stage-direction provides for "<hi rend="italic">a Schoole
       master</hi> .4. <hi rend="italic">Countrymen</hi>: <hi rend="italic">and Baum</hi> [read <hi
       rend="italic">Bavian</hi>] .2. <hi rend="italic">or</hi> 3 <hi rend="italic">wenches, with a
       Taborer</hi>." The discrepancy is especially curious because the source for the piece,
      Beaumont's anti-masque, clearly requires six; either the author&mdash;Fletcher&mdash;had not
      decided at the beginning how all the women were to be gathered on stage or he was simply
      uncertain as to the composition of the cast. At any rate, the discrepancies point to an
      authorial manuscript of a species closer to foul paper than fair copy. The inconsistencies in
      the casting of both female and male parts (see note 15) lead one to wonder, indeed, if the
      author even had a complete text of Beaumont's masque <pb n="011.071"/> before him as he wrote.
      The masque was licensed on February 27, 1613, and printed, presumably, shortly after, but the
      cast of the morris dance is given in a narrative description, in language reflecting the
      viewpoint of a reporter or spectator, rather than in the text proper; the 1647 Folio text is
      more likely to be based on Beaumont's own papers, and it has only the bare direction, "<hi
       rend="italic">The second Antimasque rusheth in, they dance their measure, and as rudely
       depart</hi>." It is quite improbable that the dance in the play was the genesis for that in
      the masque; Stowe's <hi rend="italic">Annales</hi> (1631) speaks of the anti-masque as being
      of <q>a strange and different fashion from others, both in habit and manners, a very
       delectable: a rural or country maske, consisting of many persons, men and women, being in
       sundry habits, likewise as strange, variable and delightful,<ref target="f011.05.16" n="16"
         ><hi rend="super">16</hi></ref></q> and as A. H. Thorndike wrote, "it is inconceivable that
      this antimasque should have been introduced into that notable court entertainment after having
      been staled at the public theatres."<ref target="f011.05.17" n="17"><hi rend="super"
       >17</hi></ref> Thorndike adds, however, that the company must have utilized the morris dance
      very shortly after the masque was presented, "while the novelty and success of this dance were
      common talk. A few years later, other antimasques would have been performed at the theatre."
      The quarto's description of the anti-masque especially notes the audience's delight with the
      "Countrey jollitie" and records that James himself called for an encore.</p>




     <p>An inconsistency in the designation of a character occurs in II.i-ii and is notable because
      it appears to reveal the authors' division of labor. The facts are briefly these. II.i is a
      prose scene assigned to Fletcher's collaborator, with II.ii a verse scene clearly belonging to
      Fletcher. In the former, the Jailer makes his first appearance and is called <hi rend="italic"
       >Iailor</hi> in the stage-direction and in the speech-prefixes. But at both his appearances
      in II.ii, he is called <hi rend="italic">Keeper</hi>, in the speeches, entrances, and
      prefixes. It is quite unlikely that the Jailer and Keeper are in fact two different persons;
      there is no indication elsewhere in the text that Palamon and Arcite are guarded by more than
      one man; there is only one Jailer in the play's source, Chaucer's <hi rend="italic">Knight's
       Tale</hi>; and in II.iv Fletcher has the Jailer's Daughter, there so called, speak of her
      father as the "meane Keeper of his Prison". When the Jailer reappears in Acts IV and V, in
      both Fletcherian and non-Fletcherian scenes, he is <pb n="011.072"/> regularly <hi
       rend="italic">Iailor</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">Iaylor</hi>). The likeliest explanation is
      that Fletcher himself realized the discrepancy after writing II.ii.</p>

     <p>The inconsistency in character-names is accompanied by a further irregularity in the
      articulation of scenes i and ii, as marked in Q. The dialogue establishes that II.i is played
      in a garden court just below the tower where Palamon and Arcite are imprisoned. It is to this
      court that the Jailer, his Daughter, and her Wooer enter; during the scene, Palamon and Arcite
      appear&mdash;without speaking&mdash;on their prison parapet above, upon which they are
      observed by the others below. The scene is closed with a bare "<hi rend="italic">Exeunt</hi>".
      II.ii opens with another entrance for Palamon and Arcite, as follows: "<hi rend="italic">Enter
       Palamon, and Arcite in prison</hi>." Now, on the Jacobean stage this would in fact have been
      a re-entrance and as such quite anomalous. There is no indication of an intended break in the
      continuity of action: Q's II.i-ii must have been played as a single scene, with Palamon and
      Arcite remaining on the upper stage after the departure of the Jailer and his company at the
       "<hi rend="italic">Exeunt</hi>" of scene i.</p>

     <p>But the irregularities are readily explained as consequences of divided authorship, with the
      shares of the two authors imperfectly joined. Had the authors composed their work in close
      collaboration, it is unlikely that the discrepancy in character-names or the re-entry of
      Palamon and Arcite would have occurred.<ref target="f011.05.18" n="18"><hi rend="super"
        >18</hi></ref> Nor would these irregularities be likely to have persisted in a fair copy
      made either by one of the authors or a competent theatrical scribe. The implication is that
      the printer's copy was the <hi rend="italic">two</hi> authors' foul papers, or a very literal
      transcript of them, showing no editing or normalization in these scenes, at least. It also
      seems to be implied that the two authors wrote their shares simultaneously but without close
      consultation; had, for example, Shakespeare written his share (and to Fletcher's collaborator
      goes the initiation of all the major lines of action) from retirement in Stratford, leaving
      Fletcher to complete his fragments, as some scholars have postulated, we should expect
      Fletcher to have achieved a closer meshing of his scenes than appears here. The textual
      evidence thus supports the inference Sir Edmund Chambers drew from the <pb n="011.073"/>
      authorial divisions: "The distribution of the Shakespearean matter shows that it is a case of
      collaboration and not of the completion by Fletcher of a Shakespearean fragment" (<hi
       rend="italic">W. S.</hi>, I, 532).</p>


     <p>If the printer's copy for Q were foul papers, it is improbable that the scene divisions,
      including the erroneous division at II.ii, were an original feature of the manuscript. The
      formal division merely reflects, of course, the apparent clearance of the stage at the end of
      II.i and the following entrance of Palamon and Arcite. It is also improbable that the
      divisions were introduced while the manuscript was in the playhouse. For one thing, there are
      several errors in the scene numbers,<ref target="f011.05.19" n="19"><hi rend="super"
       >19</hi></ref> whereas we would expect accuracy if the divisions were introduced for a
      functional purpose&mdash;for example, as a means of articulating the shares of the two
      authors, which, according to the pattern shown by the variant character-names for the Jailer,
      consisted of scenes (or groups of scenes) on separate sheets. Furthermore, it seems to have
      been Edward Knight's practice to delete scene divisions when they appeared in his copy, as he
      did when he prepared Massinger's manuscript of <hi rend="italic">Believe as you List</hi> for
      the stage. Only in <hi rend="italic">The Soddered Citizen</hi> did he allow the copy scene
      divisions to stand, and when parts of some scenes of that play were deleted, he was scrupulous
      in correcting the scene numbers accordingly. Possibly the divisions were introduced by the
      publisher, at the time of printing. The greater number of Waterson's plays are fully divided;
      of the ten plays he first published, seven are divided into acts and scenes and three into
      acts alone.<ref target="f011.05.20" n="20"><hi rend="super">20</hi></ref> Greg suggests that
      the numbering of scenes was mainly a literary convention (<hi rend="italic">First Folio</hi>,
      p. 144). It is fruitless to guess just how the errors in the scene numbers occurred, but it is
      safe to assume that accuracy would not be so pressing a concern in a text prepared for
      printing as for performance.<ref target="f011.05.21" n="21"><hi rend="super"
      >21</hi></ref></p>




     <p>Since playhouse manuscripts, that is, prompt books, are scrupulously accurate in the placing
      of speech-prefixes,<ref target="f011.05.22" n="22"><hi rend="super">22</hi></ref> errors in
      this respect which appear in a printed text may point to foul papers as printer's <pb
       n="011.074"/> copy. Some of those shown by the <hi rend="italic">Kinsmen</hi> may be
      compositorial in origin, but at least a few probably belonged to the copy. There is one
      misplacing: "<hi rend="italic">Emil</hi>." is printed a line too late at II.ii.119, so that
      the first line of her speech is given to Arcite. There are three different repetitions of the
      same speech-prefix in consecutive lines, of "<hi rend="italic">Per</hi>." at III.v.97-98, of
      "1. <hi rend="italic">Fr</hi>." at IV.i.141-42, and of "1 . . . <hi rend="italic">K</hi>." at
      V.iv.38-39. All three may represent compositorial eye-skip, but for the third there is also
      some evidence, to be discussed below, of copy error. There are two omissions, of the
      Schoolmaster's prefix at III.v.137 and of Palamon's at V.iv.1. Finally, there are two
      redundant prefixes (i.e., two in one speech), one for the Wooer at IV.i.46 and one for Palamon
      at V.i.130. The former appears in Q as follows: <q>
       <l>2. <hi rend="italic">Fr</hi>. Not well?----<hi rend="italic">Wooer</hi>, No Sir not well.
        45</l>
       <l><hi rend="italic">Woo</hi>. Tis too true, she is mad.</l>
      </q> The Wooer's half line in 45 may represent a marginal addition, although, since it is
      metrically necessary, it is more likely that the compositor omitted it and in making the
      correction had to supply a new prefix in order to distinguish the Wooer's speech from the
      second friend's, on the same line. Palamon's extra prefix follows a stage direction which
      interrupts his long prayer to Venus.</p>


     <p>Attention has already been called to the appearance in Q of indefinite and permissive stage
      directions&mdash;in entrances calling for "<hi rend="italic">attendants, &amp;c</hi>." or ".2.
      or 3 <hi rend="italic">wenches</hi>"&mdash;and to the marginal direction in III.vi which
      amounts to an explanatory gloss on the text. A further word needs to be said on the stage
      directions for the spectacular episodes, all of which fall in non-Fletcherian scenes. These
      have all the tone of authorial directions for the producer: <q><hi rend="italic">Here they
        fall on their faces as formerly, and there is heard clanging of Armor, with a short Thunder
        as the burst of a Battaile, whereupon they all rise and bow to the Altar</hi>.</q>
      <q>(V.i.61)</q>
      <q><hi rend="italic">Still Musicke of Records</hi>.</q>
      <q><hi rend="italic">Enter</hi> Emilia <hi rend="italic">in white, her haire about her
        shoulders, a wheaten wreath</hi>: <hi rend="italic">One in white holding up her traine, her
        haire stucke with flowers: One before her carrying a silver Hynde, in which is conveyd
        Incense and sweet odours, which being set upon the Altar her maides standing a loofe, she
        sets fire to it: then they curtsey and kneele</hi>.</q>
      <q>(V.i.136)</q> The direction for music may be the prompter's addition&mdash;its location
      suggests interpolation&mdash;but the rest is clearly the author's.</p>

     <pb n="011.075"/>

     <p>It may be added to the evidence already presented that Q shows no general tendency to print
      entrances a few lines too early, a feature which is sometimes characteristic of prompt copy.
      It seems clear enough that foul papers are the ultimate basis for the quarto <hi rend="italic"
       >Kinsmen</hi>. As suggested above, however, there is some possibility of an intervening
      scribal transcript, in the light of recent suggestions made by Cyrus Hoy in <hi rend="italic"
       >Studies</hi><ref target="f011.05.23" n="23"><hi rend="super">23</hi></ref> and by Professor
      Bowers in <hi rend="italic">On Editing Shakespeare</hi>, concerning the lesser incidence of
      Fletcher's <hi rend="italic">ye</hi>'s in certain printed and manuscript texts of his plays.
      Briefly, Hoy conjectures that when such plays as <hi rend="italic">The Woman's Prize</hi> or
       <hi rend="italic">A Wife for a Month</hi> show far fewer <hi rend="italic">ye</hi>'s than the
      average for Fletcher's other unaided plays, there is strong likelihood of scribal influence at
      work. The hypothesis is, as he points out, demonstrably true of <hi rend="italic"
      >Bonduca</hi>, which exists in two states: a private transcript from foul papers by Knight,
      showing 147 <hi rend="italic">ye</hi>'s, and the 1647 Folio text, from the prompt book,
      showing 352. The Folio text must more nearly represent Fletcher's usage. It has already been
      observed that the <hi rend="italic">Kinsmen</hi> is marked by two sets of linguistic
      characteristics which may be presumed authorial; one is certainly Fletcher's. In the
      tabulation which follows, Fletcher is assigned lines 25-28 of I.i (the attribution will be
      discussed below); I.iv.25-38; II.ii-vi; III.iii-vi; IV.i-ii; V.i.1-17; V.ii; and V.iv.22-38;
      to Fletcher's collaborator go all of Act I except the passages noted above; II.i; III.i-ii;
      IV.iii; V.i.18-173; and V.iii-iv, except lines noted above. These divisions give Fletcher 1517
      lines, according to Kittredge's lineation, and his collaborator 1257 lines. <table>

      </table> When projected against the average Hoy gives for Fletcher's unaided <pb n="011.076"/>
      plays (322), the incidence of <hi rend="italic">ye</hi>'s in his parts of the <hi
       rend="italic">Kinsmen</hi> is decidedly low. The occurrence of '<hi rend="italic">em</hi>'s,
       <hi rend="italic">i'th'</hi>s, and <hi rend="italic">o'th</hi>'s in Fletcher's parts is about
      what should be expected, and according to W. E. Farnham's examination of colloquial
      contractions in <hi rend="italic">The Winter's Tale, Henry VIII</hi>, and <hi rend="italic"
       >The Two Noble Kinsmen</hi>, the rate of occurrence of these and other contractions in the
      non-Fletcherian scenes of the <hi rend="italic">Kinsmen</hi> identifies these scenes as
      Shakespeare's. If scribal intervention has been at work, it has manifested itself only in a
      diminution of Fletcher's <hi rend="italic">ye</hi>'s, as with <hi rend="italic">The Woman's
       Prize</hi>, and even at the lower rate, <hi rend="italic">ye</hi> serves to distinguish the
      shares of the two authors.</p>



     <p>Dr. Hoy suggests that the reduction of <hi rend="italic">ye</hi>'s in the 1647 Folio text of
       <hi rend="italic">The Woman's Prize</hi> may be attributed to Edward Knight; the Folio text
      appears to be based upon a prompt book which was very probably in Knight's hand. As noted
      above, Knight's manuscript of <hi rend="italic">Bonduca</hi> also reflects a prejudice against
      Fletcher's <hi rend="italic">ye</hi>'s. If the low rate of <hi rend="italic">ye</hi>'s in the
       <hi rend="italic">Kinsmen</hi> is indicative of scribal influence, Knight's hand might be
      suspected here also, were it not that the text provides other evidence&mdash;the restriction
      of his peculiar punctuation to the prompt annotations&mdash;indicating that Knight's work may
      be distinguished from the basic text. However, the manuscript Knight took in hand might well
      have been a transcript made by an assistant for the revival of the middle 1620's or by another
      book-keeper for even earlier stage use. We may recall that in addition to the original
      production of 1613 there appears to have been a court performance, or consideration therefor,
      in 1619 or 1620. A post-revival transcript is improbable; if a new prompt book were prepared
      for the revival in the 1620's, as seems probable, whatever manuscript Knight first took in
      hand would be available to serve as printer's copy and a further transcript would be
      unnecessary.</p>

     <p>Whether it was the foul papers themselves or a very literal transcript of them, the
      manuscript from which Q was printed was utilized for some kind of theatrical purpose. The
      annotator showed himself implicitly aware of his text's inadequacy when he provided a warning
      note for the entrance of Palamon and Arcite at I.iv (see above), although he failed to correct
      the omission of their names from the stage-direction itself. This defect, or the confusion
      over the Jailer's title in II.i-ii, or the inconsistencies in the number of dancers required
      for the morris in III.v, would render the text inconvenient, to say the least, in actual
      performances. In advising that the Elizabethan theatre be approached with some consideration
      of present-day and past theatrical experience, Professor Bowers has a suggestion which might
      apply in the present case: <pb n="011.077"/>
      <q>It may seem probable . . . that as an ordinary procedure once the production of the play
       was started with the copying of the parts, the making-up of the prompt copy would be delayed
       to incorporate as many as possible of the revisions decided on in the test of rehearsal . . .
       . The manuscript from which the parts were made would suffice for the initial ordering of the
       play, and indeed the book-keeper's jottings we occasionally surmise in the author's
       manuscript may well have been the notes made as the action was worked out during rehearsal.
       Presumably as scene by scene the play was perfected in rehearsal, the prompt copy might be
       transcribed from this manuscript.<ref target="f011.05.25" n="25"><hi rend="super"
        >25</hi></ref></q> Thus, initial plans for production of the <hi rend="italic">Kinsmen</hi>
      might have been laid with whatever manuscript was at hand, with the marginal annotations
      representing notes the prompter made during this planning stage, perhaps before the parts were
      copied out, since some of the speeches would need working on before the actors could begin
      memorizing their lines. The notes are manifestly incomplete, but they would certainly be
      supplemented when the regular book was eventually constructed.</p>


     <p>To the above Professor Bowers adds, however, that <q>If something like this were the general
       procedure, then it is obvious that the usual author's original drafts or very foul papers
       would not do, and that a temporary manuscript to serve as a basis for the copying of the
       parts and for guiding rehearsals would be a practical necessity before the book-keeper was
       ready to engage himself to the preparation of the final prompt book.</q> A transcript which
      reproduces as many of the original copy's errors as are shown in Q might seem uneconomical; on
      the other hand, the need for legibility may have been sufficiently great to justify an
      intermediate transcript, even one which turned out to be as literal as the printer's copy for
      Q. Such a transcript might have been particularly expedient for a collaborated play in which
      the authors appear to have written their parts on separate groups of sheets, with,
      furthermore, the parts of one author bearing interpolations by his colleague (see below).</p>

     <p>At any rate, no very clear alternative to the intermediate transcript presents itself, to
      account for the diminished number of <hi rend="italic">ye</hi>'s in Fletcher's scenes. There
      is the possibility that Fletcher's collaborator gave the play its final form and in the
      process changed most of Fletcher's <hi rend="italic">ye</hi>'s to <hi rend="italic"
      >you</hi>'s; but the evidence already shown indicates that the authors wrote their scenes
      separately, and there is further evidence, to be discussed below, that the play went through
      Fletcher's hands last, not for general revision but for the insertion of additional matter;
      there is no <pb n="011.078"/> evidence of the collaborator's hand in Fletcher's scenes. There
      is the second possibility that one of the compositors is to blame. An analysis of certain
      spellings and of the spacings around punctuation shows that the quarto was set by two
      compositors, Compositor A doing B1-C1, C2<hi rend="super">v</hi>-E4, F3<hi rend="super"
       >v</hi>-G2<hi rend="super">v</hi>, G4<hi rend="super">v</hi>, I1-I4<hi rend="super">v</hi>,
      K3, and L4<hi rend="super">v</hi>-M2<hi rend="super">v</hi>, and Compositor B, C1<hi
       rend="super">v</hi>-C2, E4<hi rend="super">v</hi>-F3, G3-G4, H1-H4<hi rend="super">v</hi>,
       I4<hi rend="super">v</hi>-K2, K3<hi rend="super">v</hi>-L3<hi rend="super">v</hi>, M3<hi
       rend="super">v</hi>-M4<hi rend="super">v</hi>, and the Prologue and Epilogue on A1<hi
       rend="super">v</hi> and N1. According to this division, 25 of Fletcher's <hi rend="italic"
       >ye</hi>'s and 122 of his <hi rend="italic">you</hi>'s in the text proper fall in A's stint,
      with 13 and 130 in B's; the ratio of <hi rend="italic">ye</hi>'s to <hi rend="italic"
      >you</hi>'s in A's pages is thus about one to five, but only one to ten in B's, exclusive of
      Prologue and Epilogue. But even A's rate is far below Fletcher's for his unaided plays. And
      although there are three <hi rend="italic">you</hi>'s but no <hi rend="italic">ye</hi>'s in
      the Prologue, there are seven <hi rend="italic">ye</hi>'s but no <hi rend="italic">you</hi>'s
      in the Epilogue; the latter distribution does not show Compositor B's apparent preference for
       <hi rend="italic">you</hi> in the play itself to have been constant. There is little doubt
      that the Epilogue is Fletcher's, and the Prologue is probably his as well; if the printer's
      copy for the dramatic text proper were a transcript, it is quite possible that the Epilogue,
      at least, was still printed from Fletcher's original draft. The <hi rend="italic">you</hi>'s
      in the Prologue, however, may denote that it was set from a transcript; perhaps there is other
      evidence of the textual homogeneity of the Prologue and Fletcher's scenes in the occurrence in
      both of a rather unusual spelling, <hi rend="italic">take</hi> for <hi rend="italic"
      >tack</hi>, in the phrase, <hi rend="italic">take about</hi> (see line 26 of the Prologue, and
      III.iv.10 and IV.i.152 in two Fletcherian scenes).</p>

     <p>Some compositorial influence in the reduction of Fletcher's <hi rend="italic">ye</hi>'s may
      be present, but it would not seem to have been especially significant.<ref target="f011.05.26"
       n="26"><hi rend="super">26</hi></ref></p>


     <pb n="011.079"/>

     <p>There is one final possibility, which, although it rests upon an altogether undemonstrable
      hypothesis, does permit a rationalization of the apparently conflicting evidence of the
      linguistic criteria in Fletcher's scenes, on the one hand, and on the other, of the various
      tangles and irregularities which seem to mark foul papers. All the evidence, bibliographical
      as well as structural and stylistic, indicates that the two authors wrote their scenes
      separately, and in no very close collaboration; it is possible, therefore, that their separate
      sets of pages were handed in to be assembled at the playhouse, presumably by one of the
      authors, and that a transcript was made of Fletcher's scenes but not of his collaborator's. On
      the face of it, the transcription of the scenes of only one author in a collaborated play
      would seem somewhat unlikely, but it might be conjectured that Fletcher's pages were in such a
      messy state it was felt imperative to prepare clean copy of them, even though, for whatever
      reason, the original draft of his collaborator was accepted as it stood. It could well have
      been that some priority had to be established, with Fletcher's scenes being the less legible.
      The fact that the textual tangles and evidences of illegibility seem to be chiefly prevalent
      in the non-Fletcherian scenes would appear to support the hypothesis.<ref target="f011.05.27"
       n="27"><hi rend="super">27</hi></ref> Evidence will be presented below that some of the
      non-Fletcherian scenes bear a few additional lines by Fletcher, to suggest that those scenes
      went through his hands last; but since his interpolations are relatively short, they are not
      necessarily inconsistent with the procedure sketched above; there is nothing to indicate any
      general revision upon Fletcher's part. The whole play would almost have to have been put
      together by one of the authors; Fletcher's treatment of his collaborator's scenes suggests
      that the responsibility of assemblage was his, and, as conjectured above, the task may have
      been performed at the play-house, after both parts had been submitted to the company. The
      interpolations could have been introduced at the same time.</p>


     <p>If some such procedure as that described above were followed, the chief desideratum would
      appear to have been simply clean copy, in accord with Professor Bowers's hypothesis, for some
      discrepancies remain in Fletcher's scenes&mdash;i.e., the variant character-name for the
      Jailer in II.ii (although it may have been the scribe who later regularized his title), or the
      confusion over the number of wenches for the morris dance in III.v. So, while it cannot be
      demonstrated, the transcription of Fletcher's scenes provides an explanation for the
      diminished <hi rend="italic">ye</hi>'s and for the signs of foul papers: the preservation in Q
      of various <pb n="011.080"/> marks of jointure between the scenes of the two collaborators and
      the tangles and irregularities which are more numerous in the scenes given to Shakespeare. But
      whether the printer's copy was an intermediate transcript, foul papers, or a mixture of the
      two, it seems clear enough that foul papers are the ultimate basis for Q.</p>

     <p>Differences of style or metre in scattered passages in certain of the non-Fletcherian scenes
      have led a number of critics to suppose that such scenes had been reworked by Fletcher. Thus
      Chambers (<hi rend="italic">W. S.</hi>, I, 532) found no evidence of revision but suggested
      that "in fitting the scenes together, Fletcher may possibly have added a few lines to
      Shakespeare's." For at least one of the interpolated passages Chambers cited, some visible
      "seams" remain in Q, to provide further evidence of the author's method of collaboration. The
      passage is V.iv.22-38;<ref target="f011.05.28" n="28"><hi rend="super">28</hi></ref> it
      presents no conclusive linguistic or metrical evidence for or against Fletcher's authorship,
      but the exaggerated courage Palamon displays in it is strongly suggestive of Fletcher, and it
      incidentally resolves the sub-plot involving the Jailer's Daughter, the development of most of
      which had been in Fletcher's hands. There is no mark of textual disarrangement at line 22, but
      at the other end there are two significant features. Q prints lines 21-23 and 37-40 as
      follows: <q>3. K. Come? who begins? 21</q>
      <q>
       <sp>

      </q> Line 39 is not only metrically defective but the speech-prefixes show a manifest error;
      the dramatist hardly intended that the first knight <pb n="011.081"/> should answer himself.
      But if lines 22-38 are excised, as they may be without destroying the sense of what is left,
      then the first and second knights' declaration in line 39, "Wee'l follow cheerefully", becomes
      a natural answer to the <hi rend="italic">third</hi> knight's question in line 21, "Come? who
      begins?" Significantly, the question and answer make up one full line.</p>


     <p>An alternative explanation for the confusion in speech-prefixes based on compositorial
      misreading must ascribe the apparent relation between divided authorship and textual
      irregularity to sheer coincidence. It is more probable that the repetition of prefixes is an
      inadvertent seam resulting from an imperfect fusing of Fletcher's addition with an originally
      non-Fletcherian scene. It would appear that after the initial draft was complete, Fletcher
      went through his collaborator's scenes, or some of them, not to effect a thoroughgoing
      revision (unless he subsequently prepared a fair copy, for which there is no evidence), but
      here and there to insert slight additions, making little or no attempt to remove the marks of
      jointure. One of the other passages Chambers cites&mdash;I.i.25-28&mdash;is also marked by
      defective lineation, as is a third if its line divisions are slightly adjusted. Chambers put
      the interpolation at I.iv.32-38; line 24, however, is a short line followed by a full line
      beginning a new speech, and if we allow the addition to have begun at line 25, it can then
      include a passage which I think has a Fletcherian ring: "Yet they breathe And haue the name of
      men" (ll. 27-28). Thorndike thought Fletcher had retouched 28-49 of this scene&mdash;that is,
      to the end of the scene. If Fletcher's work extends that far, the textual confusion at 40-45
      may be related to his intervention, but in what fashion it is impossible to say, except that
      in this case Fletcher must have cancelled the original ending of his collaborator or worked
      his additions into his collaborator's lines so that they cannot now be distinguished. The
      division I have adopted, 25-38, is a somewhat unsatisfactory compromise. Finally, Chambers and
      every recent commentator has assigned V.i.1-17 to Fletcher; the number of '<hi rend="italic"
       >em</hi>'s and <hi rend="italic">ye</hi>'s is evidence of his work, although there is no
      disarrangement of text or lineation here to mark off the interpolation.</p>

     <p>The quarto provides a little other evidence of alteration, but it is probably not authorial.
      It lies in two questions of plus or minus, with probability pointing to the latter, at least
      for the second instance. The first occurs in IV.ii, which opens with a long soliloquy by
      Emilia. The initial entrance reads, "<hi rend="italic">Enter Emilia alone, with</hi> 2. <hi
       rend="italic">Pictures</hi>", but her speech is closed with a second entrance, "<hi
       rend="italic">Enter Emil. and Gent</hi>." The second example occurs in IV.iii, where two
      exits are marked for the Jailer's Daughter, at lines 43 and 63, both on sig. K2<hi
       rend="super">v</hi>. The <pb n="011.082"/> exits just bracket her vehement and no doubt
      censorable denunciation of adulterous courtiers and her cynical comment on proud ladies. In
      each case we can only guess whether the duplications represent addition or deletion. The whole
      scene in which Emilia's soliloquy appears is unquestionably Fletcher's, so if there has been
      addition it was Fletcher's; on the other hand, in 54 lines of soliloquy Emilia protests too
      much, so that deletion is equally possible, by Knight or any one else through whose hands the
      manuscript passed in the playhouse. On stylistic and linguistic grounds IV.iii appears to be
      homogeneous, and it is probable that the first exit for the Jailer's Daughter shows deletion
      to avert censorship.</p>

     <p>Except for the passage cited above, the play shows no evidence of general censorship,
      although, as Greg warned, "the presence or absence of profanity cannot be regarded as
      affording altogether reliable evidence respecting the nature and date of the manuscript that
      served as copy for a printed text" (<hi rend="italic">First Folio</hi>, p. 152). <hi
       rend="italic">The Two Noble Kinsmen</hi> is not a heavily profane play, but it does contain a
      few oaths with which Sir Henry Herbert might have taken exception&mdash;e.g., "Marry," "god's
      lyd," "Faith," numerous invocations of God and Gods, and even one affirmation by "wine and
      bread"&mdash;and if we may judge from his practice in <hi rend="italic">Barnavelt</hi>, Buc
      would have objected to the courtier reference in IV.iii. For what it is worth, then, such
      evidence points to an unrevised draft or at least an unexpurgated transcript; it also points
      back to the date of original composition rather than revision or transcription for the revival
      of 1625-26. One might also note that Knight's copy of <hi rend="italic">The Honest Man's
       Fortune</hi>, made within a year or so of the <hi rend="italic">Kinsmen</hi>'s revival, shows
      fairly extensive purgation, particularly of such obvious expletives as "God", in which the <hi
       rend="italic">Kinsmen</hi> abounds.</p>

     <p>There is one other area of evidence which may have some bearing on the nature of the copy.
      In <hi rend="italic">The Shakespeare First Folio</hi>, Sir Walter Greg wrote, "if we find any
      considerable number of eccentric or archaic spellings in a print, the likelihood is great that
      it was set from the author's own manuscript and not from a scribal copy" (p. 148). I should
      not want to say that a "considerable number" of eccentric spellings occur in <hi rend="italic"
       >The Two Noble Kinsmen</hi>, but I have the impression that the texture is more archaic in
      the scenes ascribed to Shakespeare. The list which follows is drawn from his scenes and also
      represents spellings which are paralleled in various texts of his acknowledged plays, thought
      to have been printed from authorial manuscripts: <hi rend="italic">angle</hi> (i.e., <hi
       rend="italic">angel</hi>), <hi rend="italic">Asprayes, boudge, cease</hi> (i.e., <hi
       rend="italic">seize</hi>), <hi rend="italic">Cizard, cizd, mervaile, right</hi> (i.e., <hi
       rend="italic">rite</hi>), and <hi rend="italic">Wrinching</hi> (i.e., <hi rend="italic"
       >rinsing</hi>). In addition, I <pb n="011.083"/> conjecture the anomalous form, <hi
       rend="italic">a eleven</hi>, at I.iii.54, to be a compositorial misreading (or
      "normalization") of an original copy spelling, <hi rend="italic">a leven</hi>. Spellings of
       <hi rend="italic">eleven</hi> with <hi rend="italic">a</hi> occur, of course, in a number of
      the Shakespeare good quartos and in Addition D of <hi rend="italic">Sir Thomas More</hi>. In
      the Fletcherian scenes I note only <hi rend="italic">stoa</hi> (i.e., <hi rend="italic"
       >stow</hi>), <hi rend="italic">aborne</hi> (i.e., <hi rend="italic">auburn</hi>), and <hi
       rend="italic">take</hi> (i.e., <hi rend="italic">tack</hi>, in both Prologue and text). I had
      hoped that a tabulation of various morphological groups according to the authorial divisions
      might be possible, but any significant variation which might have once appeared seems to have
      been almost hopelessly obscured by the compositorial pattern. In several classes the
      distribution of variant forms is disproportionate for one author or another but not
      sufficiently so to permit certainty that one of the compositors has not intervened. For
      example, the ratio of spellings in -<hi rend="italic">nck</hi> and -<hi rend="italic">nk</hi>
      in the non-Fletcherian scenes is 8:16, but in the Fletcherian scenes, 3:48; however, in the
      second half of the text only one -<hi rend="italic">nck</hi> spelling occurs. For various
      classes of elisions, the patterns may be authorial; of elisions of <hi rend="italic">e</hi> in
      verbals ending -<hi rend="italic">en</hi>, the distribution between non-Fletcherian and
      Fletcherian scenes is six to three; of <hi rend="italic">e</hi> in verbals ending -<hi
       rend="italic">er</hi>, eight to zero; of <hi rend="italic">e</hi> in various nouns and
      adjectives with -<hi rend="italic">er</hi>-, nine to three, all instances in Fletcherian
      scenes being <hi rend="italic">wondrous</hi>; and finally, the elided spellings <hi
       rend="italic">medcine</hi> and <hi rend="italic">heav'nly</hi> both appear in non-Fletcherian
      scenes.</p>

     <p>Save for the diminished <hi rend="italic">ye</hi>'s in Fletcher's scenes, the accumulation
      of evidence is, it seems to me, strong for foul papers. The hypothesis of mixed copy described
      above offers one resolution to the apparent dilemma; otherwise, we may choose between
      annotated foul papers and an annotated intermediate transcript when we pay our money. There
      are arguments on both sides. But even if it be concluded that a scribal transcript has
      intervened between the author's original draft and the printed text, the preservation in the
      quarto of so many signs of jointure and divided authorship would still warrant the inferences
      which have been drawn concerning the authors' method of collaboration. Not only the authorial
      tests but bibliographical evidence indicates that they divided their work by scenes (or
      structural dramatic units, since Q's II.i-ii really constitute a single scene) and wrote their
      shares concurrently, for, as suggested above, Fletcher would hardly have called his tower
      guard "Keeper" if he had just read his collaborator's scenes and there found the title
      "Iailor". Presumably they worked from a scenario or some sort of outline; analysis of the plot
      shows that each must have understood the essential outlines of the whole play from the very
      beginning. The Jailer-Keeper confusion is not overly serious, but <pb n="011.084"/> it is just
      the kind of discrepancy which might have occurred had the authors divided the scenes between
      themselves and then begun writing their respective shares simultaneously but in no very close
      collaboration. Then, while Fletcher seems to have given the text a final reworking, his
      revisory attentions appear haphazard and incomplete: they amounted only to the addition of
      some new matter, with a number of irregularities, some quite obvious, left untouched. It is
      quite possible that the play had to be written and put together under some pressure, so that
      it might be on the stage before the festivities attendant upon the wedding of Elizabeth and
      Frederick were over&mdash;very likely while the morris dance it borrowed from Beaumont's <hi
       rend="italic">Masque</hi> was still fresh. The great difficulty in the acceptance of
      Shakespeare's authorship is the inferiority of the scenes given to him, especially in
      characterization and thought, in comparison with his known work. Attention has already been
      called to the rather marked difference as to state of finish between the Shakespearean and
      Fletcherian parts of the play. The textual tangles and general impression of carelessness, the
      evidence that the authors did not work in especially close collaboration, and the evidence
      that it was Fletcher who gave Shakespeare's scenes their final touches, all suggest that
      Shakespeare simply did not give the play the thought and attention which might have satisfied
      those who reject the attribution of the quarto title-page.<ref target="f011.05.29" n="29"><hi

       Thomas Cotes, whose shop produced the <hi rend="italic">Kinsmen</hi>. It was Cotes, of
       course, who printed the second Shakespeare Folio of 1632; his reprint therein of <hi

       Folio text, in the scenes assigned to Fletcher. In 1639 he printed <hi rend="italic">Wit
        Without Money</hi>, a play traditionally attributed to Fletcher alone, but one which,
       because of the linguistic pattern it exhibits, Dr. Hoy suggests was revised or rewritten by

       quarto is <hi rend="italic">The Night Walker</hi>, printed in 1640. There is external
       evidence that it was revised by Shirley in 1633, and the greatly reduced number of <hi
        rend="italic">ye</hi>'s the play shows may undoubtedly be attributed to Shirley's hand;
       furthermore, a number of spellings which appear to be Shirley's, such as <hi rend="italic"
        >wonnot</hi> or <hi rend="italic">wo'not</hi>, are distributed throughout the text. The
       known fact of Shirley's revision and the additional fact that neither <hi rend="italic">Wit
        Without Money</hi> nor <hi rend="italic">The Night Walker</hi> were King's plays make it
       impossible, of course, that the quartos could have had a common scribal background. The
       variations in the linguistic patterns of the three plays also remove the printing house as a
       likely factor in the diminution of Fletcher's <hi rend="italic">ye</hi>'s.</p></note>

     <head/>
     <p>BEAUMONT'S WORK IS PRESENT IN TWELVE PLAYS of the canon, but the extent of his share in each
      of these varies widely. At the one extreme, there is <hi rend="italic">The Knight of the
       Burning Pestle</hi>, a play which I regard as wholly his. Second only to this is <hi
       rend="italic">The Woman Hater</hi>, in its original state almost certainly a product of
      Beaumont's sole authorship, but revised in five scenes of its extant text by Fletcher. Then
      there is <hi rend="italic">The Noble Gentleman</hi>, another apparently Beaumontian original
      extensively revised by Fletcher some twenty years after its composition. And after these must
      be reckoned the famous trio of <hi rend="italic">Philaster, The Maid's Tragedy</hi>, and <hi
       rend="italic">A King and no King</hi>, in all of which (but to a less extent in the first
      than in the last two) Beaumont's share is much the greater, and his hand is the controlling
      one. In <hi rend="italic">Cupid's Revenge</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Love's Pilgrimage</hi>
      the shares of the two collaborators are roughly equal, and in the collaborations with Fletcher
      and Massinger, <hi rend="italic">Beggars' Bush</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Thierry and
       Theodoret</hi>, Beaumont's work accounts for approximately a third of the whole. But with <hi
       rend="italic">The Coxcomb</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Scornful Lady</hi> we have reached
      the other extreme, for Fletcher's contribution is here the major one, and Beaumont's share in
      comparison is small indeed.</p>

     <p>To distinguish, on the basis of linguistic evidence, the respective shares of the
      Beaumont-Fletcher collaborations is not always easy or possible. Only in <hi rend="italic"
       >Love's Pilgrimage</hi>, the revised scenes of <hi rend="italic">The Woman Hater</hi>, and
      the two collaborations of Beaumont, Fletcher, and Massinger (<hi rend="italic">Beggars'
       Bush</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Thierry and Theodoret</hi>) does the Fletcherian <hi
       rend="italic">ye</hi> occur to such an extent as to point immediately to the scenes of his
      authorship. In the chief of Fletcher's collaborations with Beaumont, <hi rend="italic">ye</hi>
      is rarely found, with the result that such plays as <hi rend="italic">The Coxcomb, Cupid's
       Revenge, A King and no King, The Maid's Tragedy</hi>, and <pb n="011.086"/>
      <hi rend="italic">Philaster</hi> afford no scope for applying what has hitherto been the most
      successful linguistic test for Fletcher's authorship. All five of these plays have evidently
      been given their final form by Beaumont, and one can only assume that whatever instances of
       <hi rend="italic">ye</hi> they might once have displayed have been almost wholly removed in
      the process of stylistic revision. If one is to judge from <hi rend="italic">The Knight of the
       Burning Pestle</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Woman Hater</hi> (excluding, of course, the
      scenes revised by Fletcher), <hi rend="italic">ye</hi> is a form which Beaumont almost never
      employed. It seems reasonable to assume that, if Beaumont did re-work his finished
      collaborations with Fletcher, the Fletcherian <hi rend="italic">ye</hi> would have been one of
      the first linguistic forms to be eliminated in the interest of a single harmony of language.
      How conspicuous Fletcher's use of <hi rend="italic">ye</hi> could be in a play principally of
      Beaumont's authorship can be seen from the revised scenes of <hi rend="italic">The Woman
       Hater</hi>, probably the first play on which the two dramatists worked together. It may
      perhaps point to Beaumont's awareness of this that, thereafter, <hi rend="italic">ye</hi> has
      come to be all but banished from Fletcher's share of their most notable collaborations.</p>

     <p>With the evidence of <hi rend="italic">ye</hi> no longer available, one comes to consider
      the evidence of such other linguistic forms as <hi rend="italic">hath</hi> and <hi
       rend="italic">doth, 'em</hi> and <hi rend="italic">them, i'th, o'th'</hi>, and the rest. As
      has been seen, these have often served to distinguish the work of Fletcher and Massinger even
      when the evidence of <hi rend="italic">ye</hi> has been obscured, for each dramatist can be
      shown to have had fairly distinct preferences which tended to govern the use of such forms in
      his work. In the case of the Beaumont-Fletcher collaborations, even evidence of this sort
      avails nothing, for on the whole there is little if anything to distinguish Beaumont's
      preferences among such forms from Fletcher's. In the Beaumont-Fletcher collaborations, <hi
       rend="italic">i'th', o'th', 'em, h'as, 's</hi> for <hi rend="italic">his</hi>, and similar
      contractions can be found alike in scenes by both dramatists.</p>

     <p>The whole matter is further complicated by the fact that Beaumont's linguistic practices are
      themselves so widely divergent as to make it all but impossible to predict what they will be
      from one play to another. Thus <hi rend="italic">The Woman Hater</hi> can show a strong
      preference for <hi rend="italic">them</hi> instead of <hi rend="italic">'em</hi>, while <hi
       rend="italic">Cupid's Revenge</hi> and <hi rend="italic">A King and no King</hi> show a
      reverse preference. <hi rend="italic">Hath</hi> and <hi rend="italic">doth</hi> can occur 86
      and 22 times respectively in <hi rend="italic">The Woman Hater</hi>, and but 7 and 3 times
      respectively in <hi rend="italic">A King and no King. I'th'</hi> may appear 7 times in
      Beaumont's share of <hi rend="italic">Cupid's Revenge</hi>, and but once in the whole of <hi
       rend="italic">The Maid's Tragedy</hi>. The variety of contracted forms to be found in
      Beaumont's work is enormous, but one would be rash indeed to attempt to formulate from these a
      pattern of linguistic preferences that would purport to represent <pb n="011.087"/> his
      language practices, for no single form is to be found at a sustained rate of occurrence
      throughout his work. His use of such forms as <hi rend="italic">ye</hi>, <hi rend="italic"
       >o'th'</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">'s</hi> for <hi rend="italic">his</hi> is a case in point:
      these he neither employs regularly and to a fairly consistent degree, as does Fletcher, nor
      does he avoid using them altogether, as does Massinger. His linguistic "preferences"&mdash;if
      they can be termed such&mdash;are, in a word, nothing if not eclectic, and the quality of his
      writing gains accordingly, for his language is flexible and various. But it is this very
      protean character which makes it, in the end, quite impossible to establish for Beaumont a
      neat pattern of linguistic preferences that will serve as a guide to identifying his work
      wherever it might appear.</p>

     <p>In addition to the text of the first folio, the play is preserved in a scribal transcript in
      the Lambarde Collection at the Folger Shakespeare Library. Dr. R. C. Bald suggests that the
      manuscript, the work of the scribe of <hi rend="italic">Aglaura</hi>, was commissioned by a
      private patron of the drama; on the evidence of the stage directions which it exhibits, the
      manuscript clearly derives from a theatrical prompt-book.<ref target="f011.06.01" n="1"><hi
        rend="super">1</hi></ref> This seems to have been abridged somewhat for acting purposes, for
      the folio contains some thirty-five lines which the manuscript omits.</p>


     <p>The linguistic evidence to be derived from the two texts is sufficiently of a piece. Though
       <hi rend="italic">ye</hi> occurs somewhat more frequently in the manuscript than in the folio
      (191 instances in the manuscript to 158 in the folio), such divergence as is to be marked in
      the distribution of other language forms is hardly greater than what might be expected to
      exist between two texts independently transmitted. The important thing for the purpose of
      authorial evidence is the manner in which identical language forms appear at a virtually
      identical rate of occurrence at identical points in the two texts.</p>

     <p>In both texts, three separate linguistic patterns can be distinguished. The most readily
      discernible of these is to be traced through Acts III and IV; of the 158 occurrences of <hi
       rend="italic">ye</hi> in the folio text, 152 are found here. When, in this portion of the
      play, one finds no occurrence of <hi rend="italic">hath</hi> (the only acts in which the form
      does not appear), and but a single use of <hi rend="italic">them</hi> as opposed to 28
      instances of the contracted '<hi rend="italic">em</hi>, the share of Fletcher is clear enough.
      In contrast to the linguistic pattern that emerges from Acts III and IV is that which emerges
      from Act I (and which can be discerned again at the beginning of V,ii). Here <hi rend="italic"
       >ye</hi> does not occur in the folio text (though the form appears 4 times in the
      manuscript). Both manuscript and folio exhibit 7 occurrences of <hi rend="italic">hath</hi>;
      and while, in Act I of the folio and manuscript, <pb n="011.088"/> the contracted '<hi
       rend="italic">em</hi> appears but twice and a single time respectively, the expanded <hi
       rend="italic">them</hi> is found 16 times. In neither text is any use made throughout the
      first act of such contractions as <hi rend="italic">i'th', o'th', h'as,</hi> or '<hi
       rend="italic">s</hi> for <hi rend="italic">his</hi>. The linguistic pattern here, so markedly
      opposed to the Fletcherian one, is that of Massinger.</p>

     <p>The third linguistic pattern that is present in <hi rend="italic">Beggars' Bush</hi> can be
      traced throughout Act II, in V,i, and in the latter part of V,ii. These scenes have in common
      a number of linguistic features which sets them apart from the rest of the play. They exhibit
      an occasional use of <hi rend="italic">ye</hi> (6 instances in the folio, 15 in the
      manuscript) that is enough to provide a contrast with the Massingerian scenes where, in the
      folio at least, the form does not appear;<ref target="f011.06.02" n="2"><hi rend="super"
        >2</hi></ref> at the same time, the use of <hi rend="italic">ye</hi> in pattern number three
      never approaches the high occurrence of the form in the scenes of Fletcher's authorship. Of
      the play's 5 occurrences of <hi rend="italic">doth</hi>, 4 appear in Act II and accordingly
      mark pattern number three with their presence. While the Fletcherian scenes show a decided
      preference for '<hi rend="italic">em</hi> to <hi rend="italic">them</hi>, and the Massingerian
      scenes show an exactly opposite preference, the tendency in pattern number three, though there
      is an evident preference for the contracted form, falls somewhere between these opposing
      practices; there <hi rend="italic">them</hi> occurs 9 times in both texts, while '<hi
       rend="italic">em</hi> is used 16 times in the folio, 15 times in the manuscript. In its use
      of such contractions as <hi rend="italic">i'th', o'th</hi>', and the like, pattern number
      three does not differ in any distinguishable way from the Fletcherian one, though since these
      language forms do not have any significant part in the pattern of Massinger, the contrast on
      this score at least is sufficiently marked. Perhaps the single linguistic feature which serves
      most strikingly to distinguish pattern number three from the other two is the use of the
      contraction <hi rend="italic">ha</hi>' for <hi rend="italic">have</hi>. In the folio text this
      is found 12 times (9 times in the manuscript) in Acts II and V, but not elsewhere in the play.
      It occurs in none of the unaided plays of Massinger, and in the unaided plays of Fletcher it
      occurs but 4 times in three plays (twice in <hi rend="italic">The Loyal Subject</hi>, once
      each in <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Thomas</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Island
      Princess</hi>). To judge from its appearance in the plays that follow, it is a contraction
      that might be reasonably associated with the work of Beaumont, with whom pattern number three
      of <hi rend="italic">Beggars' Bush</hi> is to be identified.</p>


     <pb n="011.089"/>

     <p>And yet to speak of a linguistic pattern for Beaumont is something of an anomaly, as has
      already been observed. That something approaching a pattern of linguistic preferences can be
      derived from his share of <hi rend="italic">Beggars' Bush</hi> is possible simply because the
      individual features of the patterns of Fletcher and Massigner have been preserved in so
      evident a degree. When the Fletcherian <hi rend="italic">ye</hi> gives way, and Beaumont
      refrains from his use of <hi rend="italic">hath</hi> and <hi rend="italic">doth</hi>, nothing
      remains to distinguish the linguistic practices of the one from the linguistic practices of
      the other.</p>

     <p>In the table below, the occurrence of the relevant linguistic forms in both the folio and
      the manuscript texts of <hi rend="italic">Beggars' Bush</hi> is given. Figures based on the
      manuscript are enclosed in square brackets.</p>

     </list>

     <p>The prologue indicates that the play was revised when it was re-staged some years after the
      original production. Whether such evidences of Fletcher's linguistic pattern as ever existed
      in the text were lost then, or whether they had already been removed by Beaumont in his
      customary practice of giving the final form to his collaborations with Fletcher it is
      impossible to say. At any rate, Fletcher's usual language preferences are not to be found in
      any very noticeable degree in the extant text. <hi rend="italic">Ye</hi> occurs but 7 times in
      the entire play, though it should be pointed out that all instances of the form appear in
      scenes in which Fletcher's hand can be traced. The Fletcherian scenes display as well 9
      occurrences of <hi rend="italic">'em</hi> to an equal number of <hi rend="italic">them</hi>, 9
      instances of <hi rend="italic">i'th'</hi>, 3 of <hi rend="italic">o'th</hi>', 2 of <hi
       rend="italic">h'as</hi>, 2 of <hi rend="italic">'s</hi> for <hi rend="italic">his</hi>. <hi
       rend="italic">Hath</hi> is found here 5 times, <hi rend="italic">doth</hi> twice. The
      Beaumont portion shows a decided preference for <hi rend="italic">them</hi> (used 26 times) to
      the contracted <hi rend="italic">'em</hi> (used 5 times). Here <hi rend="italic">i'th'</hi>
      occurs thrice, <hi rend="italic">o'th'</hi> not at all; there are single occurrences of <hi
       rend="italic">'s</hi> for <hi rend="italic">his</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">h'as</hi>. And in
      Beaumont's share <hi rend="italic">hath</hi> is found 4 times, <hi rend="italic">doth</hi> 3
      times.</p>

     <p>In dividing the play between the two dramatists I have been guided in part by metrical
      considerations, though since a large part of the text is in prose, and since verse&mdash;when
      it occurs&mdash;is often printed as prose, even this criterion is not so serviceable as one
      could wish. In the main I have regarded all scenes involving Viola and her manifold woes as
      the work of Beaumont, while I consider Fletcher to be largely responsible for the main plot
      concerning the coxcombly Antonio, his wife Maria, and his friend Mercury whom he is so
      outrageously eager to enstate as his wife's lover. Viola is as tearful and as patiently
      self-sacrificing a maiden as Beaumont ever drew, and she has her place in a gallery that
      includes Aspatia in <hi rend="italic">The Maid's Tragedy</hi>, Bellerio in <hi rend="italic"
       >Philaster</hi>, and Urania in <hi rend="italic">Cupid's Revenge</hi>. But even an
      attribution on the basis of the play's two plots will not completely hold, for Beaumont is
      almost certainly responsible for the entire fifth act, <pb n="011.090"/> which brings both to
      their resolution. At the same time, this may be still another example of the kind of close
      collaboration between the two dramatists that is evident elsewhere in the play. One instance
      of this is I, 6; Viola's speech which opens the scene, and all of her brief lines thereafter,
      are surely the work of Beaumont, but the remainder of the scene involving Richardo and his
      drunken companions is, with almost equal surety, the work of Fletcher. Similarly with II, 2:
      Viola's first speech I regard as Beaumont's work, and the same I hold to be true of her brief
      soliloquy after the exit of the Tinker and Dorothy. Other than this, I regard the scene as
      Fletcher's. And though III, 3 is, I think, essentially Beaumont's, there are traces of
      Fletcher toward the end, as in such a line as Nan's "doe you know what a wake is? we have
      mighty cheer then, and such a coyle, 'twould blesse ye."</p>

     <p>There is no doubt that the play represents, in its original form at least, a
      Beaumont-Fletcher collaboration. The extent to which it was subsequently revised will probably
      never be satisfactorily determined. Oliphant believed the reviser to have been Massinger, and
      divided the play among the three dramatists. I find nothing in the play that points even
      remotely to Massinger, and since his work elsewhere is so very distinctive it is hard to
      imagine he is present here.</p>

     <list>
      <head type="sub">Cupid's Revenge</head>

      <item><hi rend="italic">Beaumont</hi>: I, 1, 3; II, 1-2, 4-5; III, 1-2; IV, 1, 5; V, 1.</item>

     </list>

     <p>The linguistic evidence that emerges from the play gives no very clear indication of the
      respective shares of the two dramatists. <hi rend="italic">Ye</hi> is found but a total of 13
      times, though each time it occurs in a scene which I assign to Fletcher. But contractions
      which have tended to distinguish Fletcher's linguistic pattern from that of Massinger are of
      no avail in separating his work from Beaumont's, in this play at least. <hi rend="italic"
       >'Em</hi> is used 16 times in Fletcher's share of the play, and 19 times in Beaumont's. The
      Fletcherian portion contains 3 instances of <hi rend="italic">i'th'</hi>, but that of Beaumont
      contains 7 occurrences of the form. The shares of both contain single occurrences of <hi
       rend="italic">o'th'</hi>. And while <hi rend="italic">'s</hi> for <hi rend="italic">his</hi>
      is found twice in scenes by Fletcher, it appears 8 times in scenes by Beaumont. Finally, the
      occurrence of <hi rend="italic">hath</hi> and <hi rend="italic">doth</hi> is not here confined
      to the share of a single collaborator. In Beaumont's portion, <hi rend="italic">hath</hi> is
      found once, <hi rend="italic">doth</hi> twice. In Fletcher's share, there are 5 instances of
       <hi rend="italic">hath</hi>, one of <hi rend="italic">doth</hi>. The only linguistic form of
      any significance which does not occur equally in scenes by both dramatists is the contraction
       <hi rend="italic">ha'</hi>, all 7 instances of which appear in Beaumont's portion of the
      play.</p>

     <p>Two inferences are to be drawn from the linguistic evidence afforded by <hi rend="italic"
       >Cupid's Revenge</hi>. The first is the natural one that the play has been given its final
      form by Beaumont, who in the process has eliminated most of Fletcher's <hi rend="italic"
       >ye'</hi>s. The second is of even greater significance: that Beaumont's language preferences
      are not essentially different from Fletcher's, and that the contractions (<hi rend="italic"
       >'em</hi>, <hi rend="italic">i'th'</hi>, <hi rend="italic">o'th'</hi>, <hi rend="italic"
       >'s</hi> for <hi rend="italic">his</hi>, and the like) which <pb n="011.091"/> have often
      served to separate Fletcher's work from Massinger's can be expected to appear alike in both
      portions of a play of Beaumont and Fletcher's joint authorship.</p>

     <p>The play is largely the work of Beaumont, who seems to be responsible as well for the final
      form of the whole. <hi rend="italic">Ye</hi> is found but 7 times in the entire play: 4 times
      in scenes by Beaumont, and thrice in Fletcher's V, 3. Apart from this, the only vestige of
      Fletcher's customary linguistic practices consists in the fact that, though <hi rend="italic"
       >hath</hi> and <hi rend="italic">doth</hi> are used respectively 7 and 3 times in Beaumont's
      share of the play, neither form occurs in the Fletcherian portion. Fletcher's usual preference
      for the contraction <hi rend="italic">'em</hi> (here spelled throughout the play <hi
       rend="italic">'um</hi>), to <hi rend="italic">them</hi> is evident, but a similar preference
      is evident in Beaumont's share as well. The play, indeed, furnishes striking proof that
      Beaumont's language preferences (apart from his avoidance of <hi rend="italic">ye</hi>) are
      not essentially different from Fletcher's. In the five scenes of Fletcher's authorship, <hi
       rend="italic">'um</hi> is used 10 times, <hi rend="italic">them</hi> 4 times, <hi
       rend="italic">i'th'</hi> 3 times, <hi rend="italic">o'th'</hi> 4 times, <hi rend="italic"
       >h'as</hi> 2 times, and <hi rend="italic">'s</hi> for <hi rend="italic">his</hi> a single
      time. There is little enough to distinguish the Fletcherian usage from the occurrence of the
      same forms in Beaumont's share, where <hi rend="italic">'um</hi> appears 39 times, <hi
       rend="italic">them</hi> 17 times, <hi rend="italic">i'th'</hi> 5 times, <hi rend="italic"
       >o'th'</hi> 2 times, <hi rend="italic">h'as</hi> a single time, and <hi rend="italic">'s</hi>
      for <hi rend="italic">his</hi> 4 times. Fletcher's extra-metrical verse serves, on the whole,
      to set the five scenes of his authorship apart from the rest of the play, though one of these
      (V, 3) is almost entirely prose, and prose is to be found elsewhere in his share, most notably
      in the final half of V, 1.</p>

     <p>Though one should, perhaps, be reluctant to deprive Fletcher of a share in this, the most
      celebrated play in the canon, I find no shred of evidence for assuming his work to be present
      here. Even granting Beaumont's practice of giving the final form to his collaborations with
      Fletcher, the evidence &mdash;linguistic, metrical, syntactic&mdash;which the play affords
      gives no valid basis for assuming a theory of dual authorship. Linguistically, at least, the
      play is very much of a piece, and the linguistic pattern which emerges from it is at one with
      all that we know of the pattern of Beaumont. <hi rend="italic">Ye</hi> occurs but 3 times
      throughout the play. There are 37 instances of <hi rend="italic">hath</hi>, 12 of <hi
       rend="italic">doth</hi>. For 9 occurrences of <hi rend="italic">'em</hi> (and 2 of the
      unusual <hi rend="italic">'am</hi>, which occurs as well in <hi rend="italic">The Woman
       Hater</hi>), there are 36 of <hi rend="italic">them</hi>. The contraction <hi rend="italic"
       >ha'</hi>, elsewhere associated with Beaumont, appears here 13 times. As for the contractions
       <hi rend="italic">i'th'</hi> (here used 8 times), <hi rend="italic">o'th'</hi> (used twice),
       <hi rend="italic">h'as</hi> (used once), <hi rend="italic">'s</hi> for <hi rend="italic"
       >his</hi> (used 7 times): it has been already noted that there is little if anything to
      distinguish Beaumont's use of such forms from Fletcher's. If Fletcher's work is present, it is
      present to a very negligible degree indeed, and whatever <pb n="011.092"/> distinctive
      features it may have possessed have been brought by Beaumont to a thorough conformity with the
      texture of the whole. In all essentials, the play is the product of a single dramatist.</p>

     <p>The play's opening scene incorporates two sizeable passages (of 21 and 111 lines
      respectively) from Jonson's <hi rend="italic">The New Inn</hi>, and the explanations for how
      this has come about have been numerous and various. Jonson's play was first produced, and
      immediately denounced by the first-night audience, in January 1629. On 16 September 1635,
      Herbert records in his Office-Book the receipt of one pound "from the King's Company, for the
      renewing of <hi rend="italic">Love's Pilgrimage</hi>" (<hi rend="italic">Herbert</hi>, p. 36).
      Since this was Herbert's usual fee for re-licensing an old play to which new scenes had been
      added,<ref target="f011.06.03" n="3"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref> the supposition is that
       <hi rend="italic">Love's Pilgrimage</hi> had undergone alterations. It seems reasonable to
      assume that these consisted, in part at least, in adapting the two passages from Jonson's
      hapless comedy into the old Beaumont and Fletcher play that was about to be revived. So
      disastrous had been the reception of <hi rend="italic">The New Inn</hi> that the play must
      have represented a total financial loss to the King's Company, and one might speculate that
      the actors would have been ready enough to salvage from it anything that could be put to use
      in refurbishing an old play for revival.</p>


     <p>The discussion that has raged over the reproduction of the passages in the two plays has, of
      course, been chiefly concerned with whether they were in fact transferred from <hi
       rend="italic">The New Inn</hi> at the revival of <hi rend="italic">Love's Pilgrimage</hi> in
      1635, or whether Jonson himself had lifted them from Beaumont and Fletcher's earlier work.
      Since both Beaumont and Fletcher were dead by the time Jonson wrote <hi rend="italic">The New
       Inn</hi>, neither can be charged with stealing from Jonson, and if the two passages stood in
      the original version of <hi rend="italic">Love's Pilgrimage</hi>, then Jonson must be judged
      guilty of appropriating them for his own. Oliphant (<hi rend="italic">The Plays of Beaumont
       and Fletcher</hi>, p. 439) advances an elaborate theory which would suppose Jonson to have
      commenced, "probably about the time of Fletcher's death [August 1625]," a revision of <hi
       rend="italic">Love's Pilgrimage</hi>, but one which was never carried beyond the first half
      of I, 1, When, according to Oliphant, Jonson began <hi rend="italic">The New Inn</hi> several
      years later, he reclaimed some of his lines that had gone into his revision of the earlier
      play. But since Oliphant considers the second of the <pb n="011.093"/> two passages in
      question to be the work of Fletcher, he would contend that Jonson lifted not only some of his
      own lines, but carried with him as well "the only piece of Fletcher's work he had left in the
      only scene he had meddled with." Though Oliphant "fanc[ied] that [no] other explanation has
      been put forward that satisfies so many of the conditions," his theory is rather less than
      credible. Herford and Simpson, in their edition of Jonson's <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> (II,
      198 ff.), present as convincing proof as is likely to be advanced that the passages in <hi
       rend="italic">The New Inn</hi> are the original ones. Since the authors of <hi rend="italic"
       >Love's Pilgrimage</hi> were dead at the date of Jonson's play, the passages could only have
      been introduced into their work by a later hand, most probably at the time the play was
      re-licensed in 1635.</p>

     <p>That the play represents an original Beaumont-Fletcher collaboration is, I think, certain.
      About Fletcher's presence, there can be no doubt at all. The occurrence of <hi rend="italic"
       >ye</hi> clearly charts the extent of his share, from I, 2 through the end of Act III. The
      linguistic pattern that emerges from these scenes is as distinctly Fletcherian as any to be
      found in his unaided work, or the most readily distinguishable of his collaborations with
      Massinger. <hi rend="italic">Ye</hi> in the Fletcherian scenes occurs 170 times, and is found
      but twice elsewhere in the play. The Fletcherian portion displays as well his usual linguistic
      preferences: <hi rend="italic">'em</hi> occurs 35 times, <hi rend="italic">them</hi> not at
      all. There are 3 instances of <hi rend="italic">i'th'</hi>, 5 of <hi rend="italic">o'th'</hi>,
      1 of <hi rend="italic">'s</hi> for <hi rend="italic">his. Hath</hi> is used but twice; <hi
       rend="italic">doth</hi> does not occur. Beaumont's share is distinguished from Fletcher's
      first of course by the absence of <hi rend="italic">ye</hi>, which, as has been said, occurs
      but twice in scenes assigned to him. But it is worth noting that here, as in <hi rend="italic"
       >Beggars' Bush</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Cupid's Revenge</hi>, all instances of the
      contraction <hi rend="italic">ha'</hi> appear in Beaumont's portion of the play. Finally, the
      9 instances of <hi rend="italic">hath</hi> in the Beaumont scenes afford something of a
      contrast with the infrequent use of the form in scenes by Fletcher.</p>

     <p>But the linguistic pattern that emerges for Beaumont here displays, on the whole, a wide
      variety of contractions used at a rate that can seldom be distinguished from their occurrence
      in Fletcher. Thus we find in Beaumont's share of <hi rend="italic">Love's Pilgrimage</hi> 32
      instances of <hi rend="italic">'em</hi> (with 5 of <hi rend="italic">them</hi>), 4 of <hi
       rend="italic">i'th'</hi>, 2 of <hi rend="italic">o'th'</hi>, 3 of <hi rend="italic"
      >h'as</hi>, and 3 of <hi rend="italic">'s</hi> for <hi rend="italic">his</hi>. The use of such
      contractions as these in the two shares of <hi rend="italic">Love's Pilgrimage</hi> but serves
      further to bear out the truth of what was said regarding the use of such contractions in <hi
       rend="italic">Cupid's Revenge</hi>: that they are of no value as evidence for distinguishing
      the work of Beaumont and Fletcher.</p>

     <p>That the Fletcherian <hi rend="italic">ye</hi> should be preserved to the extent that it is
      in <hi rend="italic">Love's Pilgrimage</hi> is itself remarkable in a play of which Beaumont
      was part-author; it is the more so in view of the fact that the play has undergone some degree
      of alteration. The presence of <hi rend="italic">ye</hi> would seem to indicate that here
      Beaumont is not responsible for the play's final form. It may indicate as well that the
      alterations of 1635 did not go much beyond the Jonsonian insertions in I, 1. The <hi
       rend="italic">ye'</hi>s of the Fletcherian scenes, at any rate, have not suffered the usual
      reduction that elsewhere has been found to be the inevitable consequence of a non-authorial
      revision of Fletcher's work.</p>

     <p>Like <hi rend="italic">A King and no King</hi>, <hi rend="italic">The Maid's Tragedy</hi> is
      essentially Beaumont's work. Fletcher's contribution seems to be confined to four scenes,
      though one of these IV, 1)&mdash;the scene in which Melantius confronts his sister Evadne with
      his knowledge that she is the mistress of the King, and orders her to murder her royal
      lover&mdash;constitutes the climax of the play. The catastrophe that directly results from
      this scene, the actual murder of the King by Evadne (V, 1), is also Fletcher's work.</p>

     <p>As usual with the Beaumont-Fletcher collaborations, the linguistic evidence which the play
      affords tells us very little. There is no scope for the test of <hi rend="italic">ye</hi>: the
      form occurs but 7 times in the entire play, 5 times in Beaumont's share and twice in scenes by
      Fletcher. <hi rend="italic">Hath</hi> is found 17 times in the Beaumont portion and but thrice
      in Fletcher's; <hi rend="italic">doth</hi> appears 4 times in Beaumont's share and not at all
      in Fletcher's. This is the only possible evidence of distinct linguistic preferences that
      emerges for the two collaborators. Here again the contraction <hi rend="italic">'em</hi> is
      found in the shares of both dramatists: 9 times in Beaumont's, 5 times in Fletcher's. There
      are single occurrences of <hi rend="italic">i'th'</hi>, <hi rend="italic">o'th'</hi>, and <hi
       rend="italic">'s</hi> for <hi rend="italic">his</hi> in Beaumont's share of the play, though
      none of these typically Fletcherian contractions appears in the four scenes attributed to him.
      Of the play's 14 instances of the contraction <hi rend="italic">ha'</hi>, 11 are found in
      scenes of Beaumont's authorship.</p>

     <p>I consider the extant text of the play to represent Fletcher's revision of an early work of
      Beaumont's sole authorship. There is a certain amount of external evidence for such a
      supposition. The prologue printed with the first folio text declares the play to have been
      revived some two decades after its original production: <q>
       <l>we know</l>
       <l>That what was worne some twenty yeare agoe,</l>
       <l>Comes into grace againe, and we pursue</l>
       <l>That custome, by presenting to your view</l>
       <l>A play in fashion then.</l>
      </q>
     </p>

     <p>According to the Office-Book of Sir Henry Herbert, under the date of 3 February 1626, <hi
       rend="italic">The Noble Gentleman</hi> was licensed for acting as the work of Fletcher (<hi
       rend="italic">Herbert</hi>, p. 31). The play is certainly not his unaided work, and the
      supposition must be that, since it had been revised and was about to be re-staged after a
      considerable lapse of time, it had necessarily to be licensed anew. That it was attributed to
      Fletcher is understandable, since he was the reviser. An identical situation was to occur
      eight years later, <pb n="011.095"/> when Fletcher's <hi rend="italic">A Very Woman</hi> was
      revised by Massigner and re-licensed as his work.<ref target="f011.06.04" n="4"><hi
        rend="super">4</hi></ref></p>


     <p>If the prologue, with its reference to a play in fashion "some twenty yeare agoe," was
      spoken at the revival of 1626, then the original date of <hi rend="italic">The Noble
       Gentleman</hi> would be around 1605-6, thus according perfectly with the period of Beaumont's
      early work. Apart from the occurrence of <hi rend="italic">ye</hi>, the linguistic pattern
      that emerges from the play as a whole closely resembles that of <hi rend="italic">The Woman
       Hater</hi>, another of Beaumont's early and&mdash;in its original form&mdash;unaided plays
      which was printed in 1607. Certainly the pattern is, in almost every respect, a decidedly
      un-Fletcherian one. The total occurrence of <hi rend="italic">hath</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
       >doth</hi> throughout the play (39 and 23 times respectively) comes close to approximating
      Beaumont's record use of these forms in <hi rend="italic">The Woman Hater</hi>. And the
      preference for <hi rend="italic">them</hi> to the contracted <hi rend="italic">'em</hi>
      apparent in that play is paralleled here; for 30 instances of <hi rend="italic">them</hi> in
       <hi rend="italic">The Noble Gentleman</hi>, there are but 7 of <hi rend="italic">'em. Ye</hi>
      occurs a total of 38 times in the play, and it is found at least once in all but three of the
      play's sixteen scenes. The manner in which the Fletcherian <hi rend="italic">ye</hi> thus
      comes to be grafted on to a basic linguistic pattern that fairly abounds with <hi
       rend="italic">hath's</hi>, <hi rend="italic">doth's</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">them's</hi>
      makes for something of an anomaly in the plays of the canon.</p>

     <p>In attributing the respective shares of the two dramatists, I have specified as the work of
      Beaumont and Fletcher those scenes in which the Fletcherian revisions seem to have been most
      extensive. Since <hi rend="italic">ye</hi> is not unknown in the work of Beaumont, one cannot
      consider every occurrence of the form in <hi rend="italic">The Noble Gentleman</hi> to have
      been introduced by Fletcher. But it will be understood that, in designating certain scenes as
      Beaumont's own, I by no means exclude the possibility that Fletcher has made certain stylistic
      revisions in these as well. It is only that here Beaumont's original work seems less altered
      than in those scenes where revision has been specifically indicated.</p>

     </list>

     <p>Fletcher's share in <hi rend="italic">Philaster</hi> is more considerable than in either <hi
       rend="italic">The Maid's Tragedy</hi> or <hi rend="italic">A King and no King</hi>, but here
      again it is overshadowed by Beaumont's, and once again Beaumont's is the controlling hand.
      Like the other two plays, <hi rend="italic">Philaster</hi> exhibits 7 occurrences of <hi
       rend="italic">ye</hi>, 5 of which occur in Fletcher's scenes, 2 in Beaumont's. And as is
      elsewhere the case in certain of the Beaumont-Fletcher collaborations, the only trace of
      Fletcher's linguistic pattern that is evident is his general avoidance of third person
      singular verb forms in <hi rend="italic">-th.</hi> Where <hi rend="italic">hath</hi> is found
      10 times in Beaumont's portion of the play, it appears but thrice in Fletcher's. And while <hi
       rend="italic">doth</hi> does not appear <pb n="011.096"/> at all in Fletcher's share, it
      occurs 6 times in Beaumont's. <hi rend="italic">Them</hi> is found more frequently than the
      contracted form in the Beaumont portion, but here again the contraction (which, with one
      exception, is spelled <hi rend="italic">'um</hi> throughout the play, as in <hi rend="italic"
       >A King and no King</hi>) is used at an almost equal rate in the shares of both dramatists
      (14 times in Beaumont's, 13 times in Fletcher's) and so can afford no evidence for a
      distinctive linguistic preference. This is the case with the other contractions that have
      tended to distinguish Fletcher from Massigner; their rate of occurrence in <hi rend="italic"
       >Philaster</hi>, as elsewhere in the Beaumont and Fletcher collaborations, is virtually
      identical in the shares of both dramatists.</p>

     </list>

     <p>Perhaps because Fletcher's share of the play is the larger, the features of his linguistic
      pattern emerge somewhat more clearly than is generally the case in his collaborations with
      Beaumont. <hi rend="italic">Ye</hi> appears a total of 31 times in the play: 29 times in
      scenes by Fletcher, twice in scenes by Beaumont. The Fletcherian portion displays as well 14
      instances of <hi rend="italic">y'</hi>, a form which does not appear in Beaumont's share.
      Fletcher's use of <hi rend="italic">them</hi> (4 times) is once again greatly overshadowed by
      his use of the contracted form, which occurs 4 times as <hi rend="italic">'em</hi>, 20 times
      as <hi rend="italic">'um</hi>. Other contractions associated with Fletcher are present in
      abundance: <hi rend="italic">i'th'</hi> (20 times), <hi rend="italic">o'th'</hi> (6 times),
       <hi rend="italic">h'as</hi> (7 times), <hi rend="italic">'s</hi> for <hi rend="italic"
       >his</hi> (3 times). But certain at least of these same linguistic forms are to be found in
      the three scenes assigned to Beaumont: a single instance of <hi rend="italic">'em</hi> and 6
      of <hi rend="italic">'um</hi> (to 3 instances of <hi rend="italic">them</hi>), 3 occurrences
      of <hi rend="italic">i'th'</hi>, one of <hi rend="italic">o'th'</hi>. Beaumont's share
      displays 6 occurrences of <hi rend="italic">hath</hi> and 2 of <hi rend="italic">doth</hi>. In
      Fletcher's share, <hi rend="italic">doth</hi>&mdash;as is so often the case&mdash;does not
      appear, but <hi rend="italic">hath</hi> is used to the un-Fletcherian total of 9 times.</p>

     <p>Though Beaumont's share in the actual authorship of the play is decidedly subordinate to
      Fletcher's, I think there is no doubt that he is responsible for the final form of the extant
      text. Only thus can I account for the apparently reduced occurrence of <hi rend="italic"
       >ye</hi>. If Fletcher is indeed responsible for as much of the play as I credit to him, the
      supposition would be that originally <hi rend="italic">ye</hi> occurred at a much higher rate.
      The very fact that the form appears to the extent that it does is, I think, to be interpreted
      as evidence that Fletcher was here the principal collaborator. <hi rend="italic">The Maid's
       Tragedy</hi> and <hi rend="italic">A King and no King</hi> afford examples of how, when
      Fletcher's share was confined to a few scenes, such <hi rend="italic">ye</hi>'s as he could
      manage to introduce in such a comparatively small portion of the whole all but disappeared
      under Beaumont's revising hand.</p>

     <p>Linguistically, the play can be divided into three distinct parts. That of Fletcher's
      authorship exhibits 21 of the play's 22 occurrences of <hi rend="italic">ye</hi>. Those scenes
      in which <hi rend="italic">ye</hi> is found reveal as well a strong preference for the
      contracted <hi rend="italic">'em</hi> to the full pronoun <hi rend="italic">them</hi>. In the
      Fletcherian portion, <hi rend="italic">them</hi> is used but once, while the contraction
      occurs 21 times; 3 times as <hi rend="italic">'em</hi>, 18 times as <hi rend="italic"
      >'um</hi>. The play's single instance of <hi rend="italic">o'th'</hi> is found in Fletcher's
      V, 2. Such other contractions as <hi rend="italic">i'th'</hi>, <hi rend="italic">h'as</hi>,
      and <hi rend="italic">'s</hi> for <hi rend="italic">his</hi> do not appear in the first quarto
      text. <hi rend="italic">Hath</hi>, in Fletcher's share of the play, occurs 3 times, <hi
       rend="italic">doth</hi> once.</p>

     <p><hi rend="italic">Ye</hi> does not occur in any of these scenes assigned to Massinger. There
      are here but 2 occurrences of <hi rend="italic">'em</hi>, to 18 uses of <hi rend="italic"
       >them</hi>, so reversing, in Massinger's usual fashion at this period of his career (prior to
      1621), the Fletcherian preference.<ref target="f011.06.05" n="5"><hi rend="super"
       >5</hi></ref> Though <hi rend="italic">doth</hi> does not occur in Massinger's share of the
      play, <hi rend="italic">hath</hi> appears 10 times. The play's 2 instances of <hi
       rend="italic">t'</hi> are found in Massinger's II, 1 and IV, 2.<ref target="f011.06.06" n="6"
        ><hi rend="super">6</hi></ref></p>



     <p>The linguistic evidence to be derived from Beaumont's share of the play demonstrates in
      little a tendency that can be observed in virtually all of his work: a tendency to employ
      together such distinctive linguistic forms as <hi rend="italic">ye</hi>, <hi rend="italic"
       >hath</hi>, <hi rend="italic">doth</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">'em</hi>, without using any of
      these to any very marked degree. In his share of <hi rend="italic">Thierry and Theodoret</hi>
      there are single instances of <hi rend="italic">ye</hi>, <hi rend="italic">hath</hi>, and <hi
       rend="italic">doth</hi>, while <hi rend="italic">'em</hi> and <hi rend="italic">them</hi> are
      used 6 times each.</p>

     <p>The manner in which the play's 18 occurrences of the pronominal contraction <hi
       rend="italic">'um</hi> are all to be found in scenes by Fletcher is worthy of notice. The use
      of the form in Fletcher's unaided work has already been discussed;<ref target="f011.06.07"
       n="7"><hi rend="super">7</hi></ref> it appears throughout the first quarto text of <hi
       rend="italic">Rule a Wife</hi>, and the manuscript&mdash;prepared from Fletcher's foul
      papers&mdash;of <hi rend="italic">Bonduca</hi>. Further evidence for associating the form with
      Fletcher is afforded by three of the plays&mdash;including <hi rend="italic">The Scornful
       Lady</hi>&mdash;considered in this section of the present study. The three instances of <hi
       rend="italic">'um</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Cupid's Revenge</hi> are found in scenes assigned
      to Fletcher. And the three occurrences of the form in <hi rend="italic">The Woman Hater</hi>
      appear in scenes which, if not of Fletcher's original authorship, were certainly re-worked by
      him. Finally, the fact that in <hi rend="italic">Thierry</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
       >Theodoret</hi> both Beaumont and Massigner employ the more usual contraction <hi
       rend="italic">'em</hi>, while all occurrences of <hi rend="italic">'um</hi> are confined to
      Fletcher's share of the play, is certainly striking.</p>


     <p>And yet to regard the form as distinctly Fletcherian is to involve oneself in certain real
      difficulties, as the evidence of three other plays considered in the present section makes
      clear. In both <hi rend="italic">A King and no King</hi> and <pb n="011.098"/>
      <hi rend="italic">Philaster</hi>, <hi rend="italic">'um</hi> is to be found in abundance
      throughout the shares of Beaumont and Fletcher alike. And while in <hi rend="italic">The
       Scornful Lady</hi>, <hi rend="italic">'um</hi> appears 20 times in the Fletcherian portion,
      it appears 6 times in scenes assigned to Beaumont. Since <hi rend="italic">Philaster</hi> and
       <hi rend="italic">A King and no King</hi> are largely Beaumont's work, and since presumably
      all three plays were given their final form by him, it is hard to see how <hi rend="italic"
       >'um</hi> could have found its way into scenes of his authorship if, as the evidence of <hi
       rend="italic">Thierry and Theodoret</hi> implies, <hi rend="italic">'um</hi> was the
      contraction favored by Fletcher, while <hi rend="italic">'em</hi> represented the preference
      of Beaumont.</p>

     <p>The evidence of the first quarto text of <hi rend="italic">Thierry</hi> seems valid enough,
      and there is no reason to attribute the variant forms to the separate practices of two
      compositors, or to the caprice of a single one. The occurrence of <hi rend="italic">'em</hi>
      and <hi rend="italic">'um</hi> does not coincide with bibliographical units of the printed
      text, but with separate scenes of the play itself. Thus while Beaumont's V, 1 contains 5 <hi
       rend="italic">'em</hi>'s and no <hi rend="italic">'um</hi>'s, Fletcher's V, 2 exhibits 4 <hi
       rend="italic">'um</hi>'s and no <hi rend="italic">'em</hi>'s. When, in Fletcher's I, 1, the
      two forms are found together in the same scene, both <hi rend="italic">'em</hi>'s appear on
      signatures (B1<hi rend="super">v</hi> and B2<hi rend="super">v</hi>) which contain
      respectively two and three <hi rend="italic">'um</hi>'s. From this it might be argued,
      especially since the occurrence is near the beginning of the play, that the compositor was
      faithfully trying to reproduce the less familiar contraction that stood in his copy, but twice
      failed to do so and inserted the more usual <hi rend="italic">'em</hi> instead. That <hi
       rend="italic">'um</hi> was the less familiar of the two contractions, and one not always
      preserved by compositors, is evident from the fact that, with one exception, all occurrences
      of the form in the plays of the Beaumont and Fletcher corpus appear only in quarto texts. <hi
       rend="italic">'Um</hi> appears in the text of only one play (<hi rend="italic">Wit at Several
       Weapons</hi>) included in the first folio. In the second folio texts of plays printed from
      quartos in which <hi rend="italic">'um</hi> appears, the contraction is regularly changed to
       <hi rend="italic">'em</hi>. A notable example of this is the second folio text of <hi
       rend="italic">Rule a Wife</hi>, printed from the 1640 quarto (the only quarto edition of the
      play). The 27 instances of <hi rend="italic">'um</hi> in the quarto appear in the second folio
      as <hi rend="italic">'em</hi>.</p>

     <p>To conclude, on the evidence of the manuscript of <hi rend="italic">Bonduca</hi>, and the
      quarto texts of <hi rend="italic">Thierry and Theodoret</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Rule a
       Wife</hi> (and, to a lesser extent, the quarto texts of <hi rend="italic">Cupid's
       Revenge</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Woman Hater</hi>), there is reasonably good evidence
      for regarding the pronominal contraction <hi rend="italic">'um</hi> as a distinct feature of
      Fletcher's linguistic usage, but until an explanation is furnished for the occurrence of the
      form in the Beaumont portion of <hi rend="italic">Philaster</hi>, <hi rend="italic">A King and
       no King</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">The Scornful Lady</hi>, one is hardly justified in doing
      so.</p>

     <p>Published in quarto in 1607, the play was the first in the Beaumont and Fletcher corpus to
      appear in print. It is essentially Beaumont's, and in all <pb n="011.099"/> probability
      represents an early work of his unaided authorship. Beyond any doubt, however, at least five
      scenes had been revised by Fletcher by the time the play was printed, for these are noticeably
      stamped with pronominal <hi rend="italic">ye</hi>'s, a fact which at once renders them
      conspicuous amid the rest of the play, and affords evidence of Fletcher's fondness for the
      form even at this early date. In the five scenes where Fletcher's hand is present, <hi
       rend="italic">ye</hi> occurs a total of 76 times; elsewhere in the play it occurs but twice.
      The linguistic pattern that emerges from the play as a whole&mdash;excluding these five scenes
      &mdash;is decidedly non-Fletcherian. In it, <hi rend="italic">hath</hi> is used 75 times, <hi
       rend="italic">doth</hi> 21 times. There is evident here a strong preference for the full
      pronoun <hi rend="italic">them</hi> over the contracted form which occurs once as <hi
       rend="italic">'em</hi>, thrice as <hi rend="italic">'am</hi>, the last a form which has
      occurred twice in <hi rend="italic">The Knight of the Burning Pestle</hi>. There are single
      instances of <hi rend="italic">i'th'</hi>, <hi rend="italic">o'th'</hi>, and <hi rend="italic"
       >'s</hi> for <hi rend="italic">his</hi>. The pattern&mdash;putting aside the very high
      occurrence of <hi rend="italic">hath</hi> and <hi rend="italic">doth</hi>&mdash;is typical of
      Beaumont, with his eclectic taste in contractions, but his tendency to use none to a marked
      degree.</p>

     <p>Apart from <hi rend="italic">ye</hi>, it would be difficult to determine whether or not such
      other linguistic forms as are exhibited in the scenes revised by Fletcher are to be traced to
      him. The 11 instances of <hi rend="italic">hath</hi> found here seem rather excessive for
      Fletcher, though the same five scenes display but a single use of <hi rend="italic">doth</hi>.
      And in view of what has already been said regarding the contraction <hi rend="italic"
      >'um</hi>, it may be significant that the 3 instances of the form in the play appear in scenes
      where the Fletcherian <hi rend="italic">ye</hi> is conspicuously present.</p>

       manuscript text are troublesome. The scene is unmistakably Massinger's, and there is no
       reason to suppose the <hi rend="italic">ye</hi>'s to have entered it through revision by
       either Beaumont or Fletcher. Since the <hi rend="italic">ye</hi>'s do not occur in the
       corresponding passages of the folio, and in view of Massinger's known tendency to avoid the
       form, it is tempting to consider the scribe responsible for their introduction into the
       manuscript. But if this is so, one is faced with the possibility that the scribe is
       responsible as well for the 11 <hi rend="italic">ye</hi>'s (beyond the folio's one) that the
       manuscript exhibits in the Beaumont scenes of Act V, or the 13 <hi rend="italic">ye</hi>'s
       that Act IV of the manuscript demonstrates beyond the folio's 60. The obvious fact that
       emerges is simply that, on the evidence available, it is not possible to state whether the
       scribe has introduced into his manuscript <hi rend="italic">ye</hi>'s that were not in his
       copy, or whether the folio compositor has ignored <hi rend="italic">ye</hi>'s that did stand

     <head/>
     <p>NATURE HAS ARRANGED THAT, WHERE THE odds against survival are heavy, the seeds or the eggs
      through which survival is achieved are proliferated; in the world of the printed word, human
      activity achieves a corresponding balance by destroying a very high proportion of the books
      which are produced in the greatest quantities. This must surely be a cause for rejoicing in
      the twentieth century&mdash;so far at least as contemporary production is concerned; but it
      can be a cause of difficulty, and even of error, when we move back 250 years or more and are
      forced to rely, for instance, on a single mutilated copy of a school book or even on hearsay
      for our knowledge of a once widely distributed and frequently handled publication. The study
      of Literature is probably unaffected by this; but our understanding of what people were
      reading is made more difficult. Moreover, with the destruction of popular literature went
      (though for somewhat different reasons) the almost total destruction of the records of its
      manufacture and distribution; and the survival of quantitative evidence dating back into the
      seventeenth century is rare enough to be exciting.</p>

     <p>It happened that, in 1603, the Stationers' Company received from James I the sole right of
      printing&mdash;amongst other popular books&mdash;Almanacks and Prognostications; and there has
      survived one of the ledgers<ref target="f011.07.01" n="1"><hi rend="super"
      >1</hi></ref>&mdash;a Stock Book dating from sixty years later&mdash;in which were maintained
      the basic records of the trading company within the Company. For the first twenty-four years
      of the Stock Book's use a detailed account was kept of the almanacks delivered to the
      Treasurer, the 'manager' of the English Stock of the Stationers' Company; from these details,
      and from such other contemporary evidence as I have been able <pb n="011.108"/> to find, I
      want to show the size and importance of one kind of popular book production during the reigns
      of Charles II and James II.</p>


     <p>A certain amount of information about the Company's policy in the production and sale of
      almanacks from 1603 can be found in the Court Books,<ref target="f011.07.02" n="2"><hi
        rend="super">2</hi></ref> and there are useful items of information in the Treasurer's
      Journal which covers the years from 1653 to 1698. Mr Bosanquet has written, in general terms
      and out of his great experience of handling surviving examples, an account<ref target="f011.07.03" n="3"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref> of almanacks during the seventeenth
      century. I will therefore concentrate upon the quantitative detail which survives in the Stock
      Book and try to answer as many as possible of the following questions: How many copies of each
      almanack were printed in London and how many almanacks sold well enough to be reprinted? What
      proportions remained unsold? Which were printed at Cambridge and in what quantities? What
      evidence is there for other printing of almanacks&mdash;either in London or elsewhere, either
      surreptitious or legitimate? What were the costs of setting and printing the texts and of
      printing the plates, and what was the price of paper? How much were the authors paid? At what
      prices did the Treasurer sell to London booksellers and what prices did country booksellers
      and the public normally pay? Finally, what profit did the almanack monopoly earn for the
      partners in the English Stock?</p>



     <p>The answers to some of these questions are simple and can be given most easily in tabular
      form. But, since it would be fatiguing to supply all the figures in all the years for which
      they are available, I have, in Table I, shown the details of first printings, reprints and
      unsold copies for nine years only&mdash;for the first three years, for the next three (which
      are also the first three after the Fire) and for the last three. The year at the head of each
      column is, of course, that <hi rend="italic">for</hi> which and not <hi rend="italic">in</hi>
      which the almanacks were printed.</p>

     <p>In order to provide a complete picture for one almanack and an indication of the steadiness
      of the almanack business (the evidence being available for a much longer period), I have, in
      Table II given the numbers printed of Andrews for all but two of the twenty-four years; and in
      Table III the value, at wholesale prices, of all the almanacks delivered to the Treasurer from
      the winter of 1663/4 to the winter of 1713/4, the last of the Stuart era. Table IV lists those
      almanacks which appeared after 1669 and disappeared before 1685, and which therefore do not
      find places in Table I.</p>

      </table>
     </p>

     <p>In Table I, I have added, for each three-year period, a column for the rate per 1,000 at
      which the almanacks were sold by the Treasurer, and I have marked with asterisks those
      quantities printed, under a series of agreements, by the Printer to the University of
      Cambridge. (I have also done this in Table IV.) It will be noticed that most of the almanacks
      fall into one or other of two main categories: 'blanks' and 'sorts'; the former were half a
      sheet (eight pages) longer than the latter and had the first two sheets rubricated, as
      compared with the first only; they also gave a whole opening, rather than a single page, to
      each month. The resulting blank spaces were used for private entries and provided the name for
      this category;<ref target="f011.07.08" n="8"><hi rend="super">8</hi></ref> it is possible that
      variety in 'sorts' developed while there was still only one 'blank', but it can be seen in
      Table IV that new almanacks tried out during the reign of Charles II were almost all
      'blanks'.</p>


     <pb n="011.111"/>

     <p>In Table I, I have also given a column for the amounts (taken from the Journal) paid
      annually to authors, at the beginning and at the end of the period: a few copies of each
      almanack were also bound up for presentation to authors, who usually received, in addition, a
      number of stitched 'offprints'. The normal rate for authors of 'sorts' was &pound;2 throughout
      the century; as early as 1631 Braithwaite<ref target="f011.07.09" n="9"><hi rend="super"
        >9</hi></ref> was grumbling at the payment, but sixty years later Mr (?William) Leybourn was
      content to compile half a dozen or more at forty shillings a piece. For others, however, the
      rate varied&mdash;perhaps with the success of the product the previous year; the 1658
      arrangement with William Lilly, for instance, was that he should receive &pound;60 if the
      sales of his almanack reached 20,000. John Tipper, writing to Humphrey Wanley in November
      1703,<ref target="f011.07.10" n="10"><hi rend="super">10</hi></ref> told him that the Company
      never paid the author for the first year of a new almanack (though he had been given 100
      copies as a present) but that 'if it comes to be printed another year, then they will give me
      proportionate to what they give others'.</p>



     <p>The first of the questions to which answers cannot be given in the Tables concerns
      surreptitious printing, and only the vaguest answer is possible. In the Journal there are
      scores of references to the buying in of counterfeit almanacks, to the payment of informers
      and to legal action against pirates. It is obvious that, when 20,000 copies of a book are
      being distributed within a few weeks, it cannot have been difficult for a pirate, with the
      connivance of a wholesaler, to feed another 5,000 to the market; since, as I shall show, there
      was also good profit to be earned by almanack publishing, both opportunity for and temptation
      to piracy existed; but the extent cannot even be guessed at. The most flagrant case I have
      found was the printing of almanacks at York in the early part of the period; this was the
      chief subject discussed, as a result of journeys to the north, at the last meeting of the
      Court before the Fire; it was the only subject minuted after the first&mdash;but
      informal&mdash;post-Fire meeting. In the end the two York stationers, Francis Mawburn (who
      admitted to distributing 4,000 almanacks, with twenty different titles,<ref
       target="f011.07.11" n="11"><hi rend="super">11</hi></ref> and some sheet almanacks) and
      Richard Lambert paid the English Stock respectively &pound;65 and &pound;24, early in 1667.
      The heaviness of the fines reflects either the enormous quantities unlawfully produced or the
      Company's determination to give a sharp lesson to <pb n="011.112"/> stationers in the city
      which had recently received official permission to have a press, or both.</p>


     <p>In addition to the surreptitious printing of the Company's copies, there was the legitimate
      production of other almanacks&mdash;in Dublin; in Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Glasgow; in Oxford
      and Cambridge; and even in London, where Raven's and a Welsh almanack were printed under
      licence. Moreover, the Seymour family laid claim to certain almanacks,<ref
       target="f011.07.12" n="12"><hi rend="super">12</hi></ref> as part (I suppose) of the School
      Book Patent; and there was a trickle of near-almanack publishing,<ref target="f011.07.13"
       n="13"><hi rend="super">13</hi></ref> which hoped to cash in on the demand without quite
      infringing the Company's monopoly.</p>



     <p>Unfortunately, the vouchers from which the Journal was posted have been destroyed and there
      are seldom sufficient details, against the payments to printers, to tell what work was being
      paid for. The most one is told&mdash;and this very seldom&mdash;is that, in 1668 for instance,
      Milbourn was paid at the rate of 3<hi rend="italic">s.</hi> 4<hi rend="italic">d.</hi> each
      for twenty reams of Booker and forty-five of Trigge, and that Bruges was paid &pound;9 13<hi
       rend="italic">s.</hi> 4<hi rend="italic">d.</hi> for twenty-nine reams of Saunders; or that
      in 1673 Lilliecrap received &pound;7 10<hi rend="italic">s.</hi> for twenty reams of Dade and,
      two years later, Bruges &pound;12 for thirty-two reams of Andrews.<ref target="f011.07.14"
       n="14"><hi rend="super">14</hi></ref> These are all post-Fire prices and the rates per ream,
      which work out at 3<hi rend="italic">s.</hi> 4<hi rend="italic">d.</hi>, 6<hi rend="italic"
       >s.</hi> 8<hi rend="italic">d.</hi> and 7<hi rend="italic">s.</hi> 6<hi rend="italic"
      >d.</hi>, are obviously inadequate figures upon which to base any general estimate of cost.
      Luckily Dr Thomas Yate, Principal of Brazenose College, Oxford, and Bishop Fell's efficient
      lieutenant,<ref target="f011.07.15" n="15"><hi rend="super">15</hi></ref> has left some
      estimates he made about 1671 for printing at Oxford a three-sheet book almanack in octavo. He
      took paper at 4<hi rend="italic">s.</hi> a ream (allowing 10% for wastage), composing and
      printing at 2<hi rend="italic">s.</hi> 6<hi rend="italic">d.</hi> a ream and rolling-press
      work at 4<hi rend="italic">d.</hi> per 1,000. If we accept Yate's figure for paper (which is
      occasionally confirmed in the Journal), drop the charge for the rolling-press (since the crude
      illustrations in the London almanacks must have been printed with the text) and bear in mind
      the facts that the Company rubricated two of the three sheets and often employed more than one
      printer for the same almanack, the Journal figures make more, if not <pb n="011.113"/>
      complete, sense, and we can compile the following tentative estimate for 10,000 copies of a

     <p>I have worked out that, over the ten-year period 1673/4&mdash;1682/3, the total expenditure
      by the English Stock on paper, printing and authorship was 38.2% of the total value, at
      wholesale rates, of all books and almanacks delivered to the Treasurer; 38.2% of &pound;80 is
      &pound;30 11<hi rend="italic">s.</hi> 2&frac12;<hi rend="italic">d.</hi> My figure for the
      printing of 10,000 'blanks' could be varied considerably by altering the sum paid to the
      author or the ratio of that sum to the number printed; and it is only put forward
       tentatively.<ref target="f011.07.17" n="17"><hi rend="super">17</hi></ref> I am inclined to
      think that I have underestimated the rates for printing, which would mean that the profit on
      books, which took months to accumulate, was (quite understandably) greater than that on
      almanacks which was earned in a few weeks&mdash;assuming that the length of credit on each
      kind of business was the same. The possibility that I have overestimated the profit on
      almanacks is, to some extent, supported by Richard Head who, in <hi rend="italic">The English
       Rogue</hi>,<ref target="f011.07.18" n="18"><hi rend="super">18</hi></ref> estimates that the
      Company cleared, in the early 1660s, over &pound;1,000 a year from the sale of almanacks. 'But
      a knavish printer,' he goes on, 'lately outwitted them, for he printed a great number of
      almanacks, and though he printed but two sorts, yet they served for all the other sorts [an
      ingenious <pb n="011.114"/> method of dealing with the 'sorts', and not so far from the
      Company's], only altering the title page, at the beginning, and the last sheet which we call
      the prog, or prognostication. These almanacks he affording cheaper than ordinary, as indeed
      well he might [a telling phrase], he sold off a good number of them, which was to his gain and
      their great hindrance, but he is lately discovered, and how they will deal with him I know
      not.' For once we know more than Richard Head; but his account of the York piracy suggests
      that the profit of the English Stock (out of which, of course, came handsome dividends to the
      partners) was greater than private booksellers normally made and that there was some
      foundation for the usual complaint that monopolies led to high prices. If, however, my
      calculations are right, the annual profit on almanacks was much nearer &pound;1,500 than
      &pound;1,000, and we know that it remained, until well into the second half of the nineteenth
      century, what Christopher Barker had called it in 1582 (when it was still going into the
      pockets of Watkins and Roberts) 'a pretty commoditie toward an honest mans lyving'.</p>



     <p>The last questions to which I would like to find complete answers concern the rates at which
      country booksellers normally bought from the London wholesalers and the prices which members
      of the public paid. The evidence for transactions of this kind is extremely difficult to find,
      but some light is thrown on trade prices by a dispute between a Chester bookseller, Richard
      Thropp, and his London correspondent, Edward Dod; this led to a lawsuit in 1653.<ref
       target="f011.07.19" n="19"><hi rend="super">19</hi></ref> From the evidence (and assuming
      that the English Stock rates were the same ten years before as they were in 1663) the
      following comparative figures can be given: <table>

        <cell>46</cell>
       </row>
      </table> It also appears that some almanacks were supplied in small quantities, bound in sheep
      and clasped: Gallen &amp;c.mmat; six for 2<hi rend="italic">s.</hi> 9<hi rend="italic"
      >d.</hi>, Booker (a 'blank') &amp;c.mmat; four for 2<hi rend="italic">s.</hi> 2<hi
       rend="italic">d.</hi> and Goldsmith (8<hi rend="italic">s.</hi> per 100 to wholesalers) at
      six for 1<hi rend="italic">s.</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">d.</hi> The binding rates for Gallen
      and Booker work out, respectively, at 3&frac12;<hi rend="italic">d.</hi> and 5<hi
       rend="italic">d.</hi> a copy; unfortunately, the list of binding prices, agreed in 1669,
      makes no mention either of almanacks or of clasping.</p>


     <p>Competition for the country market must have been severe in the standard
      lines&mdash;'blanks' and 'sorts'&mdash;for the wholesaler to have been <pb n="011.115"/>
      satisfied with such a small margin. The binding costs were high for single almanacks; but it
      is believed that many private customers used to have a dozen or more bound up together. The
      proportion of almanacks which survive in these bound sets is naturally large and may give a
      false picture of the numbers treated in this way; but many people must have bought them
      primarily as reference books or as 'desk' books, and only Rider, Gallen and Goldsmith were
      designed for carrying about, flat or rolled&mdash;the ancestors of our pocket diaries.</p>

     <p>The alternatives in the method and cost of binding, as always in the seventeenth century,
      make it almost impossible to arrive at what we know as the published prices. Before the Fire,
      Anthony Wood normally bought 'sorts' at 3<hi rend="italic">d.</hi> and 'blanks' at 4<hi
       rend="italic">d.</hi> each and for Wharton (1658) he paid 6<hi rend="italic">d.</hi>; these
      were probably interleaved and stitched; in December 1667 he paid 7&frac12;<hi rend="italic"
       >d.</hi> for Gadbury. Another Oxford customer, Dr Stringer, bought an almanack in 1651 for
       2<hi rend="italic">d.</hi> from Henry Cripps,<ref target="f011.07.20" n="20"><hi rend="super"
        >20</hi></ref> who, a year later, sold another almanack for 6<hi rend="italic">d.</hi>! The
      post-Fire prices would be at least 25% higher; but this does not get us very far. If any
      reader of this article can direct me to booksellers' advertisements or private accounts which
      will throw any light on the mark-up, with or without the addition of binding, between
      wholesale and retail prices during the seventeenth century, I shall be grateful.</p>


     <p>'Of necessity,' writes Mr Bosanquet at the beginning of the article to which I have already
      referred, 'an old Almanack, merely as an Almanack, must be a very dull book;' and he gives
      some splendid reasons in support of this statement. But he devotes the rest of the article to
      showing what interest and information lie hidden in almanacks. Moreover, he speculates about
      the numbers of copies printed. 'If the average edition,' he says, 'only consisted of from
      1,500 to 2,000 copies, we have a total of from three to four millions for the century, and
      this must be well under the mark. Figures such as these, even though they do not pretend to be
      correct, show that no book in the English language had such a large circulation as the annual
      Almanack.'</p>

     <p>This is as true as it is important, both for the effect of these little books on a
      population which was quite small and still far from literate, and for the sheer volume of
      business with which the book trade was able to deal in the few weeks before Christmas. But the
      really remarkable point is that Mr Bosanquet's estimate of quantity is true not for the whole
      century but for the ten years from November 1663. We cannot however multiply his estimate by
      ten and arrive thereby at a new figure for the century; although the almanack business was a
      profitable <pb n="011.116"/> one when the Company took it over, it is most unlikely that the
      numbers printed approached those of 1664 until the effects both of the Civil War stimulus to
      printing and of the Restoration conditions for peaceful distribution could be felt together.
      1665 was, in fact, a minor peak of a year, which was not equalled until 1683; it would be
      unwise to continue the line of the graph, which is astonishingly level during the period for
      which we have figures, backwards into the first half of the century, at anything like the same
      height; but further guessing would be valueless.</p>

     <p>In conclusion, I should like to mention again a factor which affected both the total number
      of almanacks in circulation and the decisions which the Stock-keepers made about the numbers
      to print for their stock each year; this factor is the quantity of almanacks surreptitiously
      printed. The figures in the 'unsold' columns for 1665 and 1666 in Table I, compared with those
      for the previous year, show clearly how well the size of the market was normally estimated<ref
       target="f011.07.21" n="21"><hi rend="super">21</hi></ref> and how vulnerable the Company was
      to competition; Mawburn and Lambert were not discovering a wholly new public from York but, to
      an uncomfortable extent, biting into the existing market. The value of unsold almanacks tended
      to increase as the century grew older; in 1684 it was nearly &pound;250 and by 1696 it was
      over &pound;300. It therefore seems as if the evenness of the Company's production in a
      generally expanding market might be explained by the ever-present fear&mdash;and fact&mdash;of
      infringement. The attack might come at any point: in 1666 and 1667 it seems to have been aimed
      at Pond and Dove; and by the time the culprits have been discovered the damage has been done;
      piracy may only delay the sale of a book; it destroys the sale of an annual. In spite of its
      caution, the English Stock found itself landed each year with a few more reams of unsold<ref
       target="f011.07.22" n="22"><hi rend="super">22</hi></ref> almanacks; but, aided by its
      caution, the Company clung to most of the profits to be made in this market under the changing
      conditions of the eighteenth century, and it was not until 1775 that Thomas Carnan succeeded
      in breaking the almanack monopoly.

     <note>Notes: Rider and Gallen contained 1 sheet and 2 half sheets. Goldsmith and Smith
      contained 2 half sheets. Lilly and Wharton contained 6 sheets before the Fire. Lilly and
      Gadbury (1668-1675) and Gadbury's Plot contained 5 sheets.</note>

     <note>'Blanks' contained 3 and 'Sorts' 2&frac12; sheets. The London 'Sheet' Almanacks were
      compiled by Gadbury and Wing. The absence of a figure in the "Copy" column means not that no
      money was paid to the author but that I have been able to discover no evidence of
      payment.</note>

     <note>For 1685-7 there are no details of unsold almanacks and, in the valuations for these
      years, books and almanacks are lumped together.</note>

     <note>All 30 almanacks for 1687 were advertised in the Term Catalogue for Michaelmas
      1686.</note>

     <head/>
     <p>AS STUDENTS OF THE SEVENTEENTH-CENTURY ENGLISH drama are only too well aware, the year 1661
      saw a sudden spring for one of the more lucrative ventures in commercial publishing, the
      pirating of popular plays. With the theatres once again open, and the stocks of play-books
      understandably low, here was a heaven-sent opportunity for the less scrupulous publisher, and
      there is evidence that he took it. A name that looms large in all accounts of the matter is
      that of Francis Kirkman. For a general account the reader may be referred to Professor R. C.
      Bald's article in <hi rend="italic">Modern Philology</hi>, XLI (1943), 17-32, and to Mr
      Strickland Gibson's <hi rend="italic">Bibliography of Francis Kirkman</hi>, Oxford, 1949
      (Oxford Bibliographical Society), unless he wishes to immerse himself in Kirkman's own, and
      not unamusing, <hi rend="italic">The Unlucky Citizen</hi>, 1673.</p>

     <p>Kirkman, in fact, denied all responsibility, though not quite all complicity, stating that
      he had been drawn in by others and that he, for his part, only printed three play-books, which
      were his own proper copies. Whatever truth there be in this &mdash; and we may note that Mr
      Gibson accepts it more or less implicitly &mdash;, the owners of the copyrights were not
      impressed, took the simplest way out, and had Kirkman's stock seized. And Kirkman, as he tells
      us himself, never got any redress.</p>

     <p>At this day, it is doubtful whether we shall ever know the ins and outs of the matter, but
      what can be said with certainty is that Kirkman, whether or not he was the principal culprit
      (and unlike any of the <pb n="011.118"/> other candidates with the exception of his printer,
      Thomas Johnson) can be connected with most of these piracies.</p>

     <p>That this is so was borne in upon the present writer in a rather unusual way. On 17
      September 1955, while examining the Folger Shakespeare Library's holdings in Beaumont and
      Fletcher, he came upon an excerpt from the 1647 folio, signatures 2K2-2M4<hi rend="super"
       >v</hi>, consisting of exactly one play, <hi rend="italic">Beggars Bush</hi>. And the point
      of the examination at that stage being watermarks, it was not less than startling to note that
      the marks in the excerpt did not belong in the folio. A cursory examination of the text,
      however, was enough to show that this was not an excerpt from the folio at all, but an
      independent print, made to resemble the folio as much as possible. Signatures and lay-out were
      the same, there was even the same row of fleurons at the head of the text, but the ornamental
      initial I was different, the tailpiece was different, and the spelling was rather more modern,
      beginning with the head-title itself, which reads BUSH, not BVSH.</p>

     <p>Now there would be an obvious explanation handy in the recollection that both for the 1616
      Jonson first folio and the 1685 Shakespeare fourth folio, under-printed sheets had been
      reprinted at a later date to make up complete sets when the stock of these sheets fell short.
      But this explanation seemed just a little too pat. For though the cases just mentioned are
      well-established, and though for the Jonson the resetting was much more extensive than has
      been realized, it seemed rather fortuitous that resetting should have been necessary not
      merely for six consecutive sheets, but for six consecutive sheets containing exactly one
      play.</p>

     <p>These considerations seemed sufficient to reject the supplementary reprint theory as a
      working hypothesis, and to cast about for a better one. And in this connexion one fact was
      thought not without possible significance. <hi rend="italic">Beggars Bush</hi> was printed in
      the 1647 folio, which means that Moseley, like ourselves, did not know of any earlier edition.
      The first known print outside the folio, in fact, was the quarto published by Humphrey
      Robinson and Anne Moseley, the owners of the copyright, in 1661. Now in some copies of this
      quarto there is a note on the title-page which did not look without its possibilities in the
       context:<q>You may speedily expect those other Playes, which <hi rend="italic">Kirkman</hi>,
       and his Hawkers have deceived the buyers withall, selling them at treble the value, that this
       and the rest will be sold for, which are the onely Originall and corrected copies, as they
       were first purchased by us at no mean rate, and since printed by us.</q></p>

     <pb n="011.119"/>

     <p>What no-one had explained so far was why, of all plays, <hi rend="italic">Beggars Bush</hi>
      should have been selected for reprinting and for carrying this note, unless that play itself
      had been pirated. And the accusing finger pointed at Kirkman seemed well worth the trouble of
      examining all the books printed for him and connected with him in the years 1660-1662 that
      could be found. The total came to just over twenty, and among these, two were of particular
      significance: John Dauncey's <hi rend="italic">A Compendious Chronicle of the Kingdom of
       Portugal</hi>, 1661, and the same author's <hi rend="italic">The English Lovers, or, a Girl
       worth Gold</hi>, 1662. The first of these gives Thomas Johnson for its printer, both are
      printed for Kirkman and one or two others, and both have at the end an identical catalogue of
      books printed for and to be sold by Francis Kirkman,<ref target="f011.08.01" n="1"><hi
        rend="super">1</hi></ref> followed by an Advertisement which, with a fine insolence, runs as
      follows: <q>Those books and playes specified in the preceding Catalogue, I acknowledge to be
       my own Copies, and printed by my direction and order, but whereas in the title page of a Play
       called <hi rend="italic">Beggers Bush</hi>, I am charged with printing and publishing that
       play and others, and to have exhausted the Prices of them, I desire notice may be taken that
       I printed none of them, but whosoever did, though he have printed them in a fairer Character
       and better Paper, yet can and will afford them as cheap as any whose Covetousness makes them
       print them in a Character, and Paper not fit for any Gentleman to look on.</q> Though that is
      not its main significance in our context, it may be noted that the phrasing of the
      advertisement leaves an interesting loophole, for all that Kirkman really says, after having
      first been so explicit about 'my direction and order' and 'printing and publishing', is that
      he never printed any of them. Since he never was a printer, that, doubtless, is entirely
      true.</p>


     <p>What is, however, of special importance for our investigation is Kirkman's amplification of
      the <hi rend="italic">Beggars Bush</hi> accusation. Though the use of the words 'those other
      Playes' clearly implied that the play itself had been pirated, Robinson and Mrs Moseley did
      not actually say so. But Kirkman, the dramatic specialist, who in at least five of his
      publications <pb n="011.120"/> offered to furnish anyone with 'all the Playes that were ever
      yet printed', and who published a list of nearly 700 after <hi rend="italic">Tom Tyler and his
       Wife</hi>, not only acknowledges the charge <hi rend="italic">expressis verbis</hi>, but also
      does not deny the piracy's existence. And for a very good reason, for he is offering it for
      sale in the front of the very book, the <hi rend="italic">Chronicle</hi>, in which the
      Advertisement first appears. There, in a list of works of which he has 'sufficient numbers',
      and heading the section <hi rend="italic">Playes</hi>, we find: <q><hi rend="italic">The
        Beggars Bush</hi>, a Comedy written by <hi rend="italic">Fran. Beamont and John
        Fletcher</hi>, both in folio, and in quarto.</q>
      <q> And the list goes on: <l><hi rend="italic">The Humerous Lieutenant</hi>; a Comedy, in
        folio.</l>
      </q> Taken by themselves, these two Beaumont and Fletcher entries might be, and generally have
      been thought to refer to excerpts from the 1647 folio. But surely, Kirkman would never have
      had 'sufficient numbers' &mdash; and the works are mentioned 'more especially' for this reason
      &mdash; of just two excerpts from the folio. There was thus, not only, a piracy of <hi
       rend="italic">Beggars Bush</hi>, but also one, still to be recovered, of <hi rend="italic"
       >The Humorous Lieutenant</hi>.</p>

     <p>What we know then, so far, is that our <hi rend="italic">Beggars Bush</hi> was in existence
      in 1661, and probably appeared not very long before the quarto, as a member of a larger series
      of piracies. Now three piratical reprints, <hi rend="italic">The Elder Brother, A King and no
       King</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">The Maids Tragedy</hi>, are known with the imprint London,
      Printed in the Year, 1661, which at least leaves no doubt about their date. But five others
      have at various times been assigned to this year, though they all have the same imprint as the
      previous legitimate edition. They are, another <hi rend="italic">Elder Brother</hi>, '1637'
      (STC 11067, Greg 515c); <hi rend="italic">Loves Mistress</hi>, '1640' (STC 13354, Greg 504c);
       <hi rend="italic">Philaster</hi>, '1652' (Greg 363g, not in Wing); and two reprints of <hi
       rend="italic">The Scornful Lady</hi>, '1651' (Wing B 1608, Greg 334g; and Greg 334h, not in
      Wing). To these we may now add <hi rend="italic">Beggars Bush</hi>, folio, and our
      hypothetical <hi rend="italic">The Humorous Lieutenant</hi>, folio, making ten in all. And the
      only man ever to advertise them all, is Francis Kirkman.<ref target="f011.08.02" n="2"><hi
        rend="super">2</hi></ref></p>


     <p>Links between <hi rend="italic">Beggars Bush</hi> and the others are not far to seek, nor
      are links between the piracies and the other publications of Kirkman and his syndicate around
      1661.</p>

     <p>It is true that <hi rend="italic">Beggars Bush</hi> is set apart from the rest by its format
       <pb n="011.121"/> &mdash; a pirate who wished to be undetected was obliged to reprint in
      folio &mdash; so that we need not look for the use of standing type, but enough distinctive
      features remain to make identification easy.</p>

     <p>The main fount, to begin with, is a peculiar one. Basically a normal pica fount, measuring
      81 mm for 20 lines, it is notable for the addition of small caps and titling caps cast on the
      same pica body, used indiscriminately instead of the normal size.<ref target="f011.08.03"
       n="3"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref> Apparently the fount had once fallen short on capitals,
      but the use of titling caps to make good the deficiency is highly uncommon and makes the fount
      very easy to spot.</p>


     <p>Now this fount has long been known to occur in some of the 1661 piracies, but that is not
      its only appearance. We find it in both the '1637' and the 1661 <hi rend="italic">Elder
       Brother</hi>, in <hi rend="italic">A King and no King</hi>, in <hi rend="italic">The Maids
       Tragedy</hi>, and further in <hi rend="italic">Hells Higher Court of Justice</hi> (Wing D 27,
      1661), <hi rend="italic">The English Lovers</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Tom Tyler</hi>, the <hi
       rend="italic">Catalogue</hi>, all 1661, and finally in <hi rend="italic">The Wits</hi>,
      printed for Henry Marsh, 1662.</p>

     <p>We may further note that the titling B on 2K2<hi rend="super">v</hi>a, l. 11 from below, of
       <hi rend="italic">Beggars Bush</hi> was printed by the identical type which printed that on
       B3<hi rend="super">v</hi>, l. 19, of the '1637' <hi rend="italic">Elder Brother</hi>, while
      the <hi rend="italic">King and no King</hi> uses for its act headings the same fount as does
      the <hi rend="italic">Beggars Bush</hi>, the identity being proved by the u of Tertius on
       2L1<hi rend="super">v</hi> of the latter, which was put there by the same type that printed
      the second u of Secundus on B3<hi rend="super">v</hi> of the former.</p>

     <p>Moreover, we find another link with <hi rend="italic">Tom Tyler</hi> in that the same rather
      coarse ornamental I opens both plays, an I which also appears in Matthew Griffith, <hi
       rend="italic">The Fear of God and the King</hi> (Wing G 2012),<ref target="f011.08.04" n="4"
        ><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref> which was printed for (and by?) Thomas Johnson in 1660.</p>


     <p>Now <hi rend="italic">Tom Tyler</hi>, in its turn, shares probably its watermark, and
      certainly its ornamental block of a vase and flowers, with the '1637' <hi rend="italic">Elder
       Brother</hi>. The latter, again, shares another ornamental block and an ornamental initial N
      of the same series as the I with the 1661 <hi rend="italic">Elder Brother</hi>, and on <hi
       rend="super">i</hi>A2 it has the identical setting of fleurons which we find at the top of
       A2<hi rend="super">v</hi> in <hi rend="italic">The Presbyterian Lash, or, Noctroff's Maid
       Whipt</hi>, printed 'for the use of Mr. Noctroff's friends' in 1661. The <hi rend="italic"
       >Lash</hi> has some importance for dating purposes, as it was received by Thomason on 25
      March. It is a skit, written to annoy the Rev. Zachary Crofton, and it has a preface signed by
      K. F. On the same principle <pb n="011.122"/> which turned Crofton into Noctroff, K. F. is
      customarily read as F. K., i.e. Francis Kirkman.</p>

     <p>The <hi rend="italic">Lash</hi>, besides assuring us that the '1637' <hi rend="italic">Elder
       Brother</hi> was actually printed in March, 1661, further links up with <hi rend="italic"
       >Hells Higher Court</hi> through a defective large capital C on the title-page of both, and
      another defective italic capital C occurring on the title-page of the former and in one of the
      headlines of the latter. The '1637' <hi rend="italic">Elder Brother</hi>, moreover, shares an
      initial B of the same series as before with the <hi rend="italic">King and no King</hi>.</p>

     <p><hi rend="italic">The English Lovers</hi>, next to be considered, is a more intricate case.
      Like the <hi rend="italic">Lash</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Hells Higher Court</hi>, it
      presents evidence of more than one text fount, but unlike these, it was not so clearly set up
      in one shop. No reservations need, however, be made in stating that the first five sheets of
      this octavo volume were printed in the same shop as the others now under consideration. On B1
      we find the same large C already noticed in the <hi rend="italic">Lash</hi> and <hi
       rend="italic">Hells Higher Court</hi>; on B4 we find a large lower case O which recurs in the
      head-title on B1 of the 1661 <hi rend="italic">Elder Brother</hi>, and on the title-page of
      this play we see that the d of Elder was printed by the same type which printed on D6<hi
       rend="super">v</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">Lovers</hi>. Similarly, a large titling E on
       A4<hi rend="super">v</hi> recurs on the title-page of <hi rend="italic">The Maids
       Tragedy</hi>. And to confirm the correctness of our identification of the text fount, we
      notice a pica titling S on C8.</p>

     <p>These nine books, then, <hi rend="italic">Beggars Bush</hi>, the '1637' and 1661 <hi
       rend="italic">Elder Brother</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Hells Higher Court</hi>, the <hi
       rend="italic">Lash</hi>, <hi rend="italic">A King and no King</hi>, <hi rend="italic">The
       Maids Tragedy</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Tom Tyler</hi> and its <hi rend="italic"
       >Catalogue,</hi> and the first section of the <hi rend="italic">Lovers</hi> form a compact
      group and leave no doubt that they come from one shop. A similarly compact group can be found
      if we now examine the remaining piracies and the other productions of the Kirkman group.</p>

     <p>The piracies still to be accounted for are the '1652' <hi rend="italic">Philaster</hi>, the
      '1640' <hi rend="italic">Loves Mistress</hi>, and the two reprints of <hi rend="italic">The
       Scornful Lady</hi>, both dated 1651. The relation, if any, of the second <hi rend="italic"
       >Scornful Lady</hi>, Greg's no 334g, to the rest is not clear, though it is certain that it
      was set partly from the other (334h) and partly from the true 1651 edition. But the first <hi
       rend="italic">Scornful Lady</hi> shares with <hi rend="italic">Loves Mistress</hi> a damaged
      titling N of medium size, occurring on the title-page in both volumes, and, as already noted
      by Professor Bowers,<ref target="f011.08.05" n="5"><hi rend="super">5</hi></ref> the fleuron
      band on A1<hi rend="super">v</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Loves Mistress</hi> recurs, with the
      addition of two parentheses, on A2 of <hi rend="italic">The Scornful Lady</hi>. Similarly, we
      find on A2 of <hi rend="italic">Loves Mistress</hi> a certain <pb n="011.123"/> obliquely
      decapitated fleuron which recurs on A2 of <hi rend="italic">Philaster</hi>, and also on A2 of
       <hi rend="italic">A pleasant Comedy</hi>, <hi rend="italic">called, The Two Merry
       Milk-maids</hi>, printed by Thomas Johnson and sold by Brook, Kirkman, Johnson and Marsh,
      i.e. the same consortium of <hi rend="italic">Tom Tyler</hi>, 1661. And moreover, <hi
       rend="italic">Loves Mistress</hi> now turns out to have similar links with the <hi
       rend="italic">Milk-maids</hi>, of which we may mention the two E's of READER on A2 of the
      latter, which recur in PHENIX and EDWARD on respectively the title-page and A2 of the
      former.</p>


     <p>Some further links in our chain are now easily come by, since they were already worked out
      by Professor Bowers in his article just cited, and we may add <hi rend="italic">The Thracian
       Wonder</hi>, <hi rend="italic">A Cure for a Cuckold</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Gammer Gurtons
       Nedle</hi> without further comment, except for noting that they are all dated 1661 and all
      mention Thomas Johnson for their printer, with Kirkman and his group, including Johnson, for
      publishers. The year's productions can now be rounded off with <hi rend="italic">A merry
       Dialogue between Band, Cuff, and Ruff</hi>, printed for F. K., 1661, another little gadfly
      affair like <hi rend="italic">Hells Higher Court</hi> and, to some extent, the <hi
       rend="italic">Lash</hi>, but far from new. It presents an immediate link with <hi
       rend="italic">Philaster</hi>, as they have an identical fleuron setting and enclosing rules
      &mdash; with slight extra leading in <hi rend="italic">Band, Cuff and Ruff</hi> &mdash; on
      their title-pages.</p>

     <p>The only publication which now remains,<ref target="f011.08.06" n="6"><hi rend="super"
        >6</hi></ref> besides the one <hi rend="italic">Scornful Lady</hi>, is <hi rend="italic"
       >Bottom the Weaver</hi> (Wing S 2937), which was printed for Kirkman and Marsh in 1661, could
      well belong to either group, but has nothing that will serve for a definite link.</p>


     <p>There is, however, one further publication that should be linked to this group, and one
      which, between its covers, crystallizes the problem of the relation between the two groups:
       <hi rend="italic">The English Lovers</hi>.</p>

     <p>As already observed, the <hi rend="italic">Lovers'</hi> first section unambiguously belongs
      with our first group. But as stated on an earlier page, it also has at its end a catalogue and
      advertisement of Kirkman's which appeared in the identical type-setting, except for minor
      corrections made in the <hi rend="italic">Lovers</hi>, at the end of the <hi rend="italic"
       >Chronicle of Portugal</hi>. In both books they form an integral part of the work, not a
      separate final section as do some other advertisement lists, and all necessary conjugacies can
      be easily established. The <hi rend="italic">Chronicle</hi> is a signed Johnson book, and
      though, as an unadorned octavo, it provides no typographic links with the second group, which
      is also certainly Johnson's work, it is yet sufficient to link the <hi rend="italic"
       >Lovers</hi> also with that group.</p>

     <p>The <hi rend="italic">Lovers</hi>, indeed, is a complicated book. Its collation, 8&deg;:
       A-E<hi rend="super">8</hi>, <pb n="011.124"/>
      <hi rend="super">2</hi>A-M<hi rend="super">8</hi>, is modestly intriguing, but the evidence
      from headlines and type is very much so, though at least they go together: 1: (A) B-E; 2: <hi
       rend="super">2</hi>A-D, <hi rend="super">2</hi>K-M; 3: <hi rend="super">2</hi>E-I. Or more
      explicitly, the book begins with five sheets signed A-E, all in the same pica text fount, and
      with the same sets of headlines persisting from B through E. There we find the signatures, and
      pagination, starting all over at A and 1 again, with a different set of headlines and a
      different pica text fount, while the text begins with Part I, Book II. And though, with four
      pages of that Book to go, the text is continuous from <hi rend="super">2</hi>D to <hi
       rend="super">2</hi>E, after <hi rend="super">2</hi>D type and headlines suddenly jump five
      sheets to pick up at <hi rend="super">2</hi>K and quietly finish the book, while in between,
      sheets <hi rend="super">2</hi>E-I, we find a third pica text fount and a third set of
      headlines. And as if cutting the book into sections of five, four, five, and three sheets
      respectively were not enough, we moreover discover that K was already printed off by the time
      I was being set, since the compositor of I, three lines from the end of I1<hi rend="super"
       >v</hi>, concluded that he had not enough copy left to fill his sheet and decided to make it
      do so all the same by turning in his pica cases and using english instead.<ref
       target="f011.08.07" n="7"><hi rend="super">7</hi></ref> This time he cast off correctly, and
      the larger type did the job.</p>


     <p>Our problem, whether our two groups of books are both from the shop of Thomas Johnson,
      therefore resolves itself into the question whether <hi rend="italic">The English Lovers</hi>
      was entirely set up in it or not.</p>

     <p>Now the division of copy seems rather peculiar for work in more than one shop, and the
      signatures will not countenance it at all, unless we are to assume that by the time printing
      started, only about half the book had yet been written, a hypothesis that has little to
      commend itself, also in view of the continuous printing from <hi rend="super">2</hi>D to <hi
       rend="super">2</hi>K. But if the whole copy was available before the book was allocated to
      its printer(s), then the division of the copy into four shares does not fit with division
      among either two or the maximum three shops, because of the sandwiching of one printer's stint
      between two stints of another.</p>

     <p>Moreover, if the copy was originally divided between several shops it would have been cast
      off first, and we should not expect a perfect link from <hi rend="super">2</hi>D to <hi
       rend="super">2</hi>E and such an imperfect one from <hi rend="super">2</hi>I to <hi
       rend="super">2</hi>K.</p>

     <p>But what especially argues against division among shops is the signing. If the copy had been
      cast off before division among shops, <pb n="011.125"/> the signatures would have been marked
      in it, and not only would the second printer not have started with A again, but the third
      printer, whether or not he was identical with the first, would never have begun to sign his
      stint with E.</p>

     <p>If, however, the whole book was the work of a single shop, it is not difficult to account
      for what happened. With an original cast-off only so far forward as to ensure a proper join
      between the first two sections, the missigning in the second section can be explained as the
      result of the second compositor's notion that he had the first sheet of text, his colleague at
      the other press the preliminaries, including the beginning of the text. That this is not
      far-fetched is demonstrated by this colleague himself, who also missigned the first page of
      the sheet following the preliminaries A, instead of B.<ref target="f011.08.08" n="8"><hi
        rend="super">8</hi></ref> And of course the consequential missigning in <hi rend="super"
       >2</hi>E becomes automatic.</p>


     <p>There are some further links between the two groups, though none of them of a compelling
      nature. Thus a particular found of handsome titling capitals, easily recognizable because its
      E's and I's came from faulty matrices and invariably show a more or less clear white hairline
      about mid-way across the shank, is in evidence in both. The E's mentioned for <hi
       rend="italic">Loves Mistress</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Milk-maids</hi> belong to it, and
      similar E's are to be found in the 1661 <hi rend="italic">Elder Brother</hi> and in the first
      section of the <hi rend="italic">Lovers</hi>, from the other group. And in fact there are some
      indications that our group differences are indeed differences, not between shops, but between
      compositors in one shop using distinct typecases in their charge. The evidence for this
      consists in a headline peculiarity, and if this interpretation is right, it means that the
      compositor who used the mixed fount first encountered in <hi rend="italic">Beggars Bush</hi>
      was in the habit of setting up his headlines in larger type than did his colleagues. In the
      few cases where use of another fount with the mixed fount, within one book, is attended with
      use of different headline sets, we invariably find a set or sets in larger-than-text type, and
      usually a set or sets in text type. And perhaps we have here an indication that the remaining
       <hi rend="italic">Scornful Lady</hi> belongs with our piracies after all, for its first
      section only again shows larger-than-text headlines, nineteen different ones, so help us.</p>

     <p>One further link remains, and this brings us back to Kirkman again. Four of our plays, two
      from each group, share a rather uncommon watermark, a peacock in his pride. They are <hi
       rend="italic">The Maids Tragedy</hi>
      <pb n="011.126"/> and <hi rend="italic">A King and no King</hi> from the first group, <hi
       rend="italic">Philaster</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Band, Cuff and Ruff</hi> from the second.
      Three piracies, that is, and one dialogue printed for Kirkman. If, as was common, the paper
      was supplied by the publisher &mdash; and in Kirkman's case we know that he did so at the
      outset of his career and near its close<ref target="f011.08.09" n="9"><hi rend="super"
       >9</hi></ref> &mdash; this would place responsibility for the three piracies squarely on his
      shoulders, whoever printed them.</p>

     <head/>
     <p>In the course of the researches which have been summarized above, it was necessary to carry
      out thorough bibliographical analyses on most of the works mentioned. Not all the results
      obtained are of equal value, and some have already been stated; but though they will of
      necessity make much less of a coherent whole than what has gone before, some of the more
      significant data obtained may perhaps be detailed here. It will be thought by some that they
      might better have been utilized for a series of scattered notes, but for ease of reference as
      well as for their evidential value in the present context it has been thought preferable to
      record them here, and to arrange them under the titles of the books examined.</p>

     <p>LOVES MISTRESS. This edition was obviously set from the genuine 1640 edition, but the manner
      in which is peculiar &mdash; though our knowledge of the ways in which compositors worked
      together is perhaps too scant to justify the word. The book was set in two different pica
      founts which alternate as follows: A3-4<hi rend="super">v</hi>, <hi rend="italic">B1-3<hi
        rend="super">v</hi></hi>, B4-C3<hi rend="super">v</hi>, <hi rend="italic">C4-D3:30</hi>,
      D3:31-F1:15, <hi rend="italic">F1:16-F3<hi rend="super">v</hi></hi>, F4-G3, <hi rend="italic"
        >G3<hi rend="super">v</hi>-4</hi>. G4<hi rend="super">v</hi> was set in long primer in order
      to get the text into this sheet, and the same smaller fount was used to print a song in two
      columns on F3<hi rend="super">v</hi>-4. In terms of the original edition printed from, the
      division of copy becomes hardly any clearer: A3-4<hi rend="super">v</hi>, <hi rend="italic"
        >B1-4<hi rend="super">v</hi>:23 thou</hi>, B4<hi rend="super">v</hi>:23 finde-D1<hi
       rend="super">v</hi>:23, <hi rend="italic">D1<hi rend="super">v</hi>:24-E2:20</hi>,
      E2:21-G2:18, <hi rend="italic">G2:19-H1<hi rend="super">v</hi>:15</hi>, H1<hi rend="super"
       >v</hi>:16-I2<hi rend="super">v</hi>:2, <hi rend="italic">I2<hi rend="super">v</hi>:3-4<hi
        rend="super">v</hi></hi>. Neither division corresponds, on the whole, to clear units of the
      book or the text, though in the latter part of the work scene divisions do seem to play a
      part. If this book was cast off, and set by two compositors simultaneously, the stints would
      not be too unequal, but the division of the copy remains curious, especially when it comes in
      the middle of a line. The headlines also do <pb n="011.127"/> not suggest a clear-cut division
      of work. There are eighteen of them, and they come together in formes in an apparently
      haphazard manner, but a manner seen in several of the plays under discussion. Though no
      solution is here offered, the facts seemed worth calling attention to.</p>

     <p>THE MAIDS TRAGEDY. This looks like an entirely regular production, set by two compositors,
      and printed on two presses, each using two skeletons. Two founts are in evidence. The mixed
      fount prints in sheets E-G and I, another fount, of similar face, prints in A-D and H. Of four
      sets of headlines, each larger than text, two print once each in sheets E-G and I, the two
      others in sheets A-D and H. No headline wanders into another skeleton, and there is very
      little switching about of headlines within the skeleton, during reimposition, although each
      page has a complete headline.</p>

     <p>THE TWO MERRY MILK-MAIDS. For reasons of typography and watermarks this play and <hi
       rend="italic">Loves Mistress</hi> must have been printed at much the same time. Besides the
      links already noticed, the two are set up in the same two founts and in the same manner, and
      they use almost exactly the same number of headlines &mdash; seventeen in this case. There is
      the same free wandering of headlines in reimposition, although the <hi rend="italic"
       >Milk-Maids</hi> split the headline over the opening. The division of founts is as follows:
      B1-C1, <hi rend="italic">C1<hi rend="super">v</hi>-D1<hi rend="super">v</hi></hi>, D2-3<hi
       rend="super">v</hi>, <hi rend="italic">D4-E1<hi rend="super">v</hi></hi>, E2-3<hi
       rend="super">v</hi>, <hi rend="italic">E4-I1</hi>, I1<hi rend="super">v</hi>-3<hi
       rend="super">v</hi>, <hi rend="italic">I4-K2</hi>, K2<hi rend="super">v</hi>-4, <hi
       rend="italic">K4<hi rend="super">v</hi></hi>, i.e. 46 pages in the one fount and 26 in the
      other. Both start with 9 and then 4 pages, but no clear pattern emerges.</p>

     <p>PHILASTER. Ostensibly a straightforward job, set in a single fount, and with a headline
      pattern much like that in <hi rend="italic">The Maids Tragedy</hi>. But there are some curious
      headline linkages, such as the spelling PHILSATER in one headline when it prints on B4, F4 and
      G4, but not when it prints on C1<hi rend="super">v</hi>, D4, E3<hi rend="super">v</hi>, H3<hi
       rend="super">v</hi> and I1<hi rend="super">v</hi>. One such anomaly might be explained away
      as a coincidence, but another headline presents an exclusive B4<hi rend="super">v</hi>-F1
      link, while two others agree in linking outer C, D, E and I to the exclusion of B, F, G and
      H.</p>

     <p>THE PRESBYTERIAN LASH. Possibly the wildest job of all, this play uses 19 headlines for
      eight formes, of which three are in larger-than-text type. Three, possibly four founts are in
      evidence, B4:8-32 being difficult to assign: A3-B2<hi rend="super">v</hi>, <hi rend="italic"
       >B3-B4:7</hi>, B4:8-32, <hi rend="italic">B4:33-C3:20</hi>, (C3:21-C3<hi rend="super">v</hi>
      in small type), <hi rend="italic">C4-D1<hi rend="super">v</hi>:19</hi>, D1<hi rend="super"
       >v</hi>:20-D2:18, <hi rend="italic">D2:19-D3:13</hi>, D3:14-D4. The last three changes in
      fount occur at scene divisions. There is clear evidence of casting off, A3 and 4<hi
       rend="super">v</hi> being set very widely, and B2<hi rend="super">v</hi> ending one line
      short, though B3 starts with a one-line speech.</p>

     <p>THE SCORNFUL LADY, Greg 334g. On the basis that Greg 334f is the genuine 1651 edition it is
      possible to work out the textual relationship between the three editions with that date on the
      title-page. A complete collation, though showing, as always, some anomalies (none of them at
      all <pb n="011.128"/> disturbing) due to coincidence, shows very clearly that 334g was set
      from 334f for sheets A-D, from 334h for sheets E-H. Though the number of variants is not
      large, it is yet too large to print the full collation here, but excerpts should be sufficient
      to illustrate the trend of the evidence: <table>

      </table> Since these are excerpts from a complete collation, and since evidence from spelling
      is always to be regarded with caution, at least in isolation, not all variants are equally
      illuminating, but the two in the earlier excerpt where 334g follows 334f in error against
      334h's correction, and the two in the second excerpt where 334h is followed in error, though
      334f is correct, are significant. One possibility, of course, must still be eliminated, but it
      is easy to show that 334g was printed from 334h (in its latter half) and not the other way
      round. Thus 334h is consistent in its proper names throughout (except for erratic lapses) when
      it uses a different spelling from 334f, as <hi rend="italic">Loveless</hi> for <hi
       rend="italic">Lovelesse</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Abigal</hi> for <hi rend="italic"
       >Abigail</hi>, but in A-D 334g agrees with f, in E-H with h. And a particularly illuminating
      variant occurs at F2<hi rend="super">v</hi> l. 9: <table>

     <p>THE SCORNFUL LADY. Greg 334h. This book presents several resemblances to some of those
      already dealt with, and if it seems possible to work out the printing history here, it should
      yet be borne in mind that certain basic assumptions are made, assumptions which we have become
      more or less accustomed to make when dealing with seventeenth-century printing, but which the
      books so far cited might tend to show are not perhaps so generally valid as we should like to
      think.</p>

     <p>The collation is the same as for the edition just described (4&deg;, A-H<hi rend="super"
       >4</hi>), the watermark is the same throughout, and so are the printer's measure and the
      running-title. Two type-founts are in evidence as follows: A, <hi rend="italic">B1-4</hi>,
       B4<hi rend="super">v</hi>-D1<hi rend="super">v</hi>, <hi rend="italic">D2</hi>, D2<hi
       rend="super">v</hi>-4<hi rend="super">v</hi>, <hi rend="italic">E</hi>, F, <hi rend="italic"
       >G</hi>, H: i.e. about two sheets more were printed in one fount than in the other. In the
      copy seen (Folger) B4 and 3<hi rend="super">v</hi> were misimposed in one another's
      positions.</p>

     <p>The imposition scheme, numbering headlines in the order in which they occur in the book and
      recording them as they appear in the formes, runs as follows: <table>

      </table> The presence of 14 headlines argues for more than one press, and the presence of two
      type founts argues for two compositors, which, in its turn, argues for two presses as the
      eighth edition of a play (and a piracy at that) would hardly be printed in a small impression
      needing two compositors to keep up with one press.</p>

     <p>Since one of the headlines used in A (2) does not occur after D (o), we may assume that A
      was printed first, not last. As compositor 1 (making the assumption of 2 compositors from the
      two founts) set two sheets more than compositor 2 (though A was of course a small job) and was
      able to help compositor 2 over B by setting B4<hi rend="super">v</hi> (compositor 2
      subsequently reciprocating by setting D2 &mdash; there is no indication that setting was by
      formes), we may think that A was finished well before B, so that press-work <pb n="011.130"/>
      began well before B. Assuming that a logical sequence was followed, we should then conclude
      that the two formes of A were machined concurrently, since the A(o) headline next occurs in a
      forme machined on press 1 (i.e. the press for which compositor 1 is assumed to have worked)
      and the two A (i) headlines in a forme machined by press 2.</p>

     <p>This would mean that the formes of B were machined concurrently with those of C, those of D
      with E, those of F with G, and, ideally, the two formes of H again machined together. In fact
      we find that the headlines on C, both inner and outer, exclude the possibility that its formes
      were machined concurrently with any others than those of B or A(i). Further, though no such
      general exclusions exist for the other formes, we find that the formes of D and E are mutually
      exclusive in their headlines, and those for F and G equally so except that F(i) and G(o)
      cannot have been at press together, as both use headline 8. But the two formes of H are again
      mutually exclusive, and H(o) is in fact imposed with the last skeleton worked on press (2)
      although it had been set by compositor 1.</p>

     <p>The printing can then be reconstructed as follows: G(o) and H(o) are from the same skeleton,
      so G(o) would have immediately preceded H(o). G(o) shares half its skeleton with G(i) and
      three-fourths with E(i) and E(o), but probability would choose G(i) as the preceding forme.
      Since G(i) shares three-fourths of the skeleton with E(o), and E(i) again three-fourths with
      B(i), there is some reason to suppose that the order of printing was B, E, G, H(o), inner
      forme preceding outer. A(i) would then naturally take its place before B(i), where both its
      headlines reappear. We might reverse the order in B, which is immaterial.</p>

     <p>If this sequence is taken as established, certain consequences follow. C, as we have seen,
      must have been printed concurrently with A(i) and/or B(i,o), so that we might tentatively
      place A(o), C(i), C(o) parallel with A(i), B(i), B(o). The order in C is again immaterial, but
      we may think that D(i) has (12, 3) together because they were together in C(o), though on
      similar grounds (13, 11) we might advocate C(o), C(i), D(o), D(i). But we also note that F(o)
      takes over three headlines from D(o), including 6, which also appears in E(i), and that since
      F(i) has 8, it would have been printed before G(o) and after E(i), while F(i), having (7, 3),
      would have been printed after D(i), and D(i) &mdash; (7, 4) &mdash;after B(o). The only way of
      meeting these conditions is by positing an order D(i), D(o), F(i), F(o), printed concurrently,
      forme for forme, with E(i), E(o), G(i), G(o). We are then left with H(i), which may reasonably
      be placed after F(o) on press 1, to give each press eight formes and make them finish
      together: <table>

     <p>IN THIS STUDY I ATTEMPT TO DISTINGUISH, AS SIMPLY as the complexities will allow, the
      several variants of Goldsmith's two plays.<ref target="f011.09.01" n="1"><hi rend="super"
        >1</hi></ref> Such an account necessarily includes an array of points not only in the
      impressions commonly regarded as of the original octavo edition but in every subsequent
      impression, each of which, whether labelled the "second" or the "fifth," is also part of the
      first edition. From this wider perspective it will be seen that previous surveys have too
      often mistaken the exception for the rule (an error which, of course, makes every normal copy
      another exception), overlooked a number of concealed "editions" (i.e., impressions), asserted
      as the proper sequence of variants one running contrary to the evident order of
       impressions,<ref target="f011.09.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref> and inferred from
      all this as quite "haphazard" a combination of sheets which proves to be entirely regular. To
      each sequence there are indeed some few exceptions, but these <pb n="011.134"/> may now be
      dismissed as the mixtures occasionally resulting either from the rapid succession of issues at
      the time of printing or from intrusions of much later date. Whatever the occasion, they are,
      at best, merely aberrations from the normal order and thus, in any representative account, of
      no significance.</p>

     <p>Within a year of its publication in 1768 Goldsmith's first play ran through five
      impressions, two of which are unlabelled, two called a "New Edition," and one described, not
      inappropriately, as a "Fifth Edition." The first was announced in the <hi rend="italic">Public
       Advertiser</hi> on Friday 5 February and another promised in the same paper on the following
      Tuesday. <q>The first large impression of the new comedy of the Good Natured Man, written by
       Dr. Goldsmith, being sold off on Saturday last, a new edition will be published this
       afternoon at three o'clock; when those ladies and gentlemen that were then disappointed of
       their books may be supplied by W. Griffin, in Catherine Street in the Strand.</q> Since the
      reference here is specifically to a "new edition" I presume that the one offered at 3 p.m. was
      the earliest printing so distinguished on its title, or the third impression in this sequence.
      If so, the second, undesignated impression must have been prepared as a supplement to the
      "large impression" and may therefore have appeared on Saturday, the day after publication.
      That it was so designed is evident from its construction, representing for five gatherings
      (A-C, I-K) an overprint of the first run through the press, for one (L) a mixture of states
      identical with those in the original printing, and for the remaining five (D-H) a new
      impression from standing type. Only in this last section are there any signs of reprinting,
      evident here both in the press figures and in textual corrections.<ref target="f011.09.03"
       n="3"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref></p>


     <p>Following its notice of the one "New Edition" the <hi rend="italic">Advertiser</hi> has no
      other reference until the 22d of February, when it lists another "New Edition, being the
      fourth" or, in our terminology, the fourth in the series of impression. Both of these "New"
      and the later "Fifth Edition" were reimpressed throughout and contain numerous revisions.</p>

     <p>Through all impressions the most extensive revision occurs in the <pb n="011.135"/> final
      gathering L<hi rend="super">2</hi>. Here there are two series of alterations, one affecting
      the first two immediately related impressions, the other the last and separate three. In the
      one sequence the compositor juggles a note which Goldsmith belatedly supplied for the epilogue
      on page [75], appending it first at the bottom of the page (state <hi rend="italic">b</hi>),
      then&mdash;to justify the register&mdash;transposing it with the last four lines of verse to
      the top of the next page (state <hi rend="italic">c</hi>), and finally&mdash;to realign the
      note with its reference&mdash;returning it to [75] and displacing four more lines of verse to
      the next page (state <hi rend="italic">d</hi>). Since with the exception of <hi rend="italic"
       >b</hi> all of these shifts involve both sides of the final leaf, it is obvious that, with
      the same exception, none of these alterations were made at press. Otherwise, in half-sheet
      imposition, the perfection of sheets on the same forme would produce here (as in the other
      play) a combination of two unrelated states.</p>

     <p>After settling the troublesome note, the compositor provided for the later impressions a
      second setting (B) to replace some other matter that had previously occupied the available
      space in chase L. For the imposition of quarters in octavo the customary layout, as described
      by Stower,<ref target="f011.09.04" n="4"><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref> is in parallel ranges
      or, in this circumstance: <!--<figure entity="sb111351"/> --> When the sheets are perfected <hi
       rend="italic">end to end</hi>, according to normal procedure, the letter of one setting is
      always kept apart from the other. For the third impression, however, this sheet apparently was
      perfected <hi rend="italic">side to side</hi>, a maneuver which can be permitted only when, as
      in this case, the letter is in duplicate. Resulting from this are two further alterations in
      the gathering, one with the outer "forme" of A perfected upon the inner of B: <q>
       <l><hi rend="italic">state e</hi> A73 B74 B75 A76</l>
      </q> the other with the outer of B perfected upon the inner of A: <q>
       <l><hi rend="italic">state f</hi> B73 A74 A75 B76</l>
      </q> Both of these occur, I believe, only in the third (or first "New") impression.</p>


     <p>In the last two impressions each of these settings was imposed separately, B alone,
      apparently, being used for the fourth (state <hi rend="italic">g</hi>) and A <pb n="011.136"/>
      alone for the fifth (state <hi rend="italic">h</hi>). In each of these the final line of the
      epilogue, previously reading <q>
       <l>And view with favour, the Good-natur'd Man.</l>
      </q> is altered to read <q>
       <l>And be each critick the Good-natur'd Man.</l>
      </q>
     </p>

    <div2  id="vol011.09.03" type="section" n="3">
     <head type="sub">She Stoops to Conquer</head>

     <p>Within a year of its publication in 1773 Goldsmith's last play ran through six impressions,
      two of which, as in the other performance, are unlabelled, the next called either the "Second"
      or "Third," the one following not improperly termed the "Fourth Edition," and the fifth and
      sixth both described as a "Fifth Edition." On Tuesday 23 March the <hi rend="italic">London
       Evening-Post</hi> promised the first edition "On Thursday next," a notice confirmed the next
      day in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Advertiser</hi>, which indicated that it would be ready
      "Tomorrow, at Four o'Clock." Very probably, then, the original issue was on the 25th, one day
      earlier than that usually assigned. From 27 March through 13 May there are many other
      advertisements, but as these invariably report "New Editions" they are of little use in
      determining the chronology of numbered impressions.<ref target="f011.09.05" n="5"><hi
        rend="super">5</hi></ref></p>


     <p>All work on this play was divided between two shops. Gatherings A to K apparently were the
      responsibility of William Griffin (the avowed printer of <hi rend="italic">The Good Natur'd
       Man</hi>), whose pressmen, as usual, identified themselves as 1, 2, and 3. In this section at
      least two compositors may also be distinguished, the first setting gatherings A-D in 8.8 cm.
      measure with headlines reading ":<hi rend="italic">Or</hi>," the second setting E-K in 8.6 cm.
      measure with headline ";Or,". Gatherings L-P were assigned to other, unidentified personnel
      who printed without figures and set uniformly in 8.4 cm. measure with headline (in its second
      state) reading ";OR".</p>


     <p>Apart from the title, which exhibits several variants adequately described in the
      accompanying Table, Griffin's section illustrates certain features requiring separate notice.
      One phenomenon not as yet recorded in recent studies of press figures is the recurrence of
      identical marks through numerous impressions.<ref target="f011.09.06" n="6"><hi rend="super"
        >6</hi></ref> In this section there are, at the <pb n="011.137"/> outset, three such
      impressions, two of a different state throughout, and the third in process of further
      correction. Each of these, it may be supposed, was successively printed from A to K and then
      returned to the printer first assigned the job. Thus at three definite intervals Griffin's men
      machined the same formes, no. 1 undertaking B, presumably, as well as F and K; no. 2 working
      C, G, and H; and no. 3 working D, E, and I. Thereafter, as shown in the Table, other
      combinations appear, some of which also persist through two or more impressions. Only
      gatherings E and F, however, are machined by the same men through all six impressions.
      Gathering I, though worked throughout by 3, is of a new setting in the last impression.</p>


     <p>As the selected readings in the Table also indicate, Griffin had, besides his three
      industrious pressmen, a very officious corrector who was especially adept in pointing the ha
      ha ha's after every witticism. Once we find him so engaged in the third impression, when he
      looked over the sheets from both shops, and once again in the fourth. While engaged upon this
      great enterprise, however, he neglected to observe that on page 13 last line of the fourth
      impression, the phrase hitherto reading <q>
       <l>No offence; but question</l>
      </q> had since been pied and the loose sorts hastily jammed in the forme to produce <q>
       <l>No offenbu; &szlig;&amp;c.nv; tquesti on</l>
      </q> This curious mishap, occurring perhaps when no. 2 withdrew his figure from the page at
      the conclusion of the third impression, went unnoticed through all succeeding pulls of the
      fourth and fifth before it was amended in the sixth.</p>

     <p>Though Griffin managed to keep his own work under control, the cast off portion sent to the
      other shop was soon mangled to a state almost beyond repair. Most of the trouble resulted, I
      suspect, from Griffin's belated or ambigous instructions concerning headlines, signatures, and
      page numbers.<ref target="f011.09.07" n="7"><hi rend="super">7</hi></ref> At first all the
      other printer had to go on, it would seem, was a provisional title and some vague remark to
      the effect that the first shop was setting "up to the ninth gathering." This advice could be
      variously interpreted either as an inclusive count starting <pb n="011.138"/> from B, the
      first sheet of text (the sense intended by Griffin), or as an exclusive count starting from A,
      the first sheet in the book (as understood by his collaborator). Proceeding from this mistaken
      assumption, the other printer then calculated eight numbers to a half-sheet and arranged his
      figures with the other data in an order beginning <table>
       <row>
        <cell>[page 1]</cell>
        <cell/>
        <cell/>
        <cell>A COMEDY.</cell>

       <row>
        <cell/>
        <cell/>
        <cell/>
        <cell>I2</cell>
       </row>
      </table> When a certain number of L in this state (and of M in the comparable state) had been
      wrought off, the printer was informed that while the title he entered in the headline once had
      been considered, it was now superseded by another.<ref target="f011.09.08" n="8"><hi
        rend="super">8</hi></ref> Moreover, he was advised, this run of signatures was "two
      gatherings behind." If so, he reasoned, the figures must also be two gatherings or 16 numbers
      behind, and all references were accordingly arranged as <table>
       <row>
        <cell/>
        <cell>THE MISTAKES OF A NIGHT.</cell>
        <cell>81</cell>
       </row>

       <row>
        <cell/>
        <cell>L</cell>

        <cell>SHE STOOPS TO CONQUER; OR | THE MISTAKES OF A NIGHT.</cell>
        <cell>83</cell>
       </row>

       <row>
        <cell/>
        <cell>L2</cell>
       </row>
      </table> In this second state the printing of L and M was concluded and the invariant series
      N-P impressed. Only then was it realized that the page numbers in the other section started
      from B and therefore, in the example cited, should run 73, 74, 75. Thus one final alteration
      was required and eventually entered, as a third state, in the full series L-P of the next
      impression.</p>




     <p>From the two earlier states it is now possible to determine the nature of the several
      variants within L and M of the first impression. Since no copies appear entirely in the first
      state but a certain number entirely in the second, it is evident that the correction was made
      before the end of printing on white paper, a circumstance which, by half-sheet imposition,
      produces three variants. In abbreviated form these may be identified and described as <table>
       <row>
        <cell/>
        <cell/>
        <cell>Page and signature, first 2 rectos</cell>

       </row>
      </table>
      <pb n="011.139"/> From the constant association of comparable variants in L and M it would
      also appear that these two signatures were imposed together, with the inner (or outer) forme
      of each within the same chase and the two chases worked simultaneously. If the correction was
      made about two-thirds of the way through white paper, the remainder then run off in the
      corrected state, and the two heaps thereafter exchanged for the reiteration, the press working
      the combined inner formes would turn out first a certain number of L-M sheets in variant <hi
       rend="italic">z</hi> and then twice as many in <hi rend="italic">x</hi>, and the press
      working outer formes an equivalent number in <hi rend="italic">z</hi> and again twice as many
      in <hi rend="italic">y</hi>. Though all totals would be doubled when the sheets were sected
      for binding, there would still be, in this hypothesis, as in the copies I have examined, an
      approximately equal number of each variant.</p>

     <head/>
     <p>WHILE PURSUING COLERIDGE'S CAREER through the pages of the <hi rend="italic">Cambridge
       Intelligencer</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Morning Chronicle</hi>, the <hi rend="italic"
       >Morning Post</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Monthly Magazine</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic"
       >Courier</hi>, I have unearthed so many variant readings and unexpected occurrences of verses
      not hitherto recorded that it has seemed advisable to make all these available in a brief
      chronological report. To be usefully inclusive I have also collated all the periodical
      publication of Coleridge's verse up through 1820 (with exceptions to be noted). And in the
      same list I have taken occasion to notice certain poems not previously collected, though their
      attribution to Coleridge will require a separate and fairly elaborate demonstration.</p>

     <p>To these Professor Robert D. Mayo has enabled me to add a report of two Coleridge poems,
      "Absence: An Ode" and "Absence: A Poem," which he has recently discovered in the Sherborne <hi
       rend="italic">Weekly Entertainer</hi> of 1793.</p>

     <p>The standard Oxford edition, edited by Ernest Hartley Coleridge in 1912, of <hi
       rend="italic">The Complete Poetical Works</hi> in two volumes or <hi rend="italic">The
       Poems</hi> in one volume (identical in congruent portions), has all the appearance of a
      thorough collation, and I trust it may be so for manuscript sources (except in such clearly
      editorially determined matters as the capitalization or non-capitalization of personifiable
      nouns). In his preface the editor promises "to furnish the student with an exhaustive summary
      of various readings," and he defends the supplying of an "exhaustive table of variants"
      however apparently trifling or accidental. He does indeed record what are intended to be
      complete newspaper variants whenever the fact of newspaper publication is known to
      him&mdash;with the exception of the <hi rend="italic">Ode to the Rain</hi>, supposed to have
      appeared in an issue of the <hi rend="italic">Morning Post</hi> that is missing from the
      British Museum file. There is a legend, however, that E. H. Coleridge did not do all the
      newspaper collations himself, and it becomes evident <pb n="011.144"/> that whoever assisted
      him sometimes let him down. Rather considerable variants of some poems have been overlooked,
      and the report of minor textual variants is especially careless for the earlier part of the
      period covered. Patent typographical errors (e.g. "freeze" for "breeze") have been emended
      silently even in the table of supposed variants&mdash;with the effect of contradicting
      Coleridge's statements that certain poems were badly printed. And in at least one instance
      what purport to be variants from a newspaper seem to be merely compiled from one of the
      manuscripts. Furthermore the discovery of several poems appearing at dates not noted makes it
      evident that no systematic examination of the periodical files has ever been made. Anything
      like an orderly search could hardly have missed the 148-line "Fragment by S. T. Coleridge" of
       <hi rend="italic">The Visions of the Maid of Orleans</hi>, for instance.</p>

     <p>It seems to have been a matter of editorial policy to disregard variations in spelling,
      punctuation, and other mechanics; yet it is disconcerting to find differences in line
      indention, in spelling ("clothes" for "cloathes," "tease" for "teize"), and capitalization
      ("Earth" for "earth" or "remorse" for "Remorse") &mdash;even in what purport to be separate
      transcriptions of the text "as first printed in the <hi rend="italic">Morning Post</hi>" or in
      texts derived uniquely from the newspaper printing.</p>

     <p>Of rather greater importance is the almost regular neglect of pseudonyms, signatures, or
      anonymity. Only after the present investigation will it be possible to compile a biography of
      Coleridge as "Albert," "Laberius," "Cuddy," etc., or variously "S.T.C.," "ESTEESI," and
      "E&Sgr;TH&Sgr;E." Again, in the E. H. Coleridge text, the titles actually used in periodical
      publication are often neglected, or titles are given to poems which had none.</p>

     <p>The present tabulation, while not claimed to be without its own errors of transcription, is
      intended to supply all variants in text, title, and signature (not spelling and mechanics,
      though these are privately available to anyone contemplating an edition) needed to correct the
      E. H. Coleridge table of variants of all Coleridge poems printed in periodicals from 1793
      through 1820&mdash;not including the <hi rend="italic">Watchman</hi>, the <hi rend="italic"
       >Friend</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Annual Anthology</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">Felix
       Farley's Bristol Journal</hi>. My concern is with poems or versions first published in
      periodicals and not with mere reprintings, although for the four newspapers carefully
      surveyed, the <hi rend="italic">Intelligencer</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Chronicle</hi>, <hi
       rend="italic">Post</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi>, all items have been attended to.
      Thus, with the exceptions just noted, all items in E. H. Coleridge's list No. I of "Poems
      first published in newspapers or periodicals" and No. II of "Epigrams and jeux d'esprit" (pp.
      1178-1180) have been collated. But I have not dealt with his list No. III of <pb n="011.145"/>
      "Poems included in anthologies and other works" (except to make one addition for 1803) nor
      made any search for reprints in other periodicals or for poems quoted in reviews.</p>

     <p>It has seemed advisable, however, to list, even when variants are not involved, the few
      further newspaper printings mentioned in E. H. Coleridge's notes but not in his lists I and
      II; also to notice poems not accepted by E. H. Coleridge though assigned to Coleridge by
      earlier editors.</p>

     <p>To bring the record up to date I have added two publications of poems in the <hi
       rend="italic">Courier</hi> and <hi rend="italic">New Times</hi> discovered by Professor
      Thomas M. Raysor in 1930; also a first publication of <hi rend="italic">Genevieve</hi> as an
      "Irregular Sonnet" in the <hi rend="italic">Morning Chronicle</hi> and three new epigrams in
      the <hi rend="italic">Monthly Magazine</hi> discovered by Professor Earl Leslie Griggs in
      1954.</p>

     <p>Undated items which I have not located are: "On a Late Connubial Rupture," said to have been
      reprinted in <hi rend="italic">Felix Farley's Bristol Journal</hi>, and "To a Friend who had
      declared his intention of writing no more poetry," said to have appeared "in a Bristol
      newspaper."</p>

     <p>Professor Carl R. Woodring, having made an independent collation of most of the newspaper
      poems, has now checked through the present list and has improved it with several corrections
      and suggestions.</p>

     <p>In the course of this survey it was suggested to me that the possibility of duplicate
      composition of the newspapers in question must be taken into account, and accordingly I made
      an effort to collate all extant copies noted in William S. Ward's recent and nearly exhaustive
       <hi rend="italic">Index and Finding List of Serials Published in the British Isles,
       1789-1832</hi> (University of Kentucky Press, 1953). The point is that before the
      introduction of the steam press in 1814 the rate of printing did not normally exceed 250
      impressions an hour, so that there had to be more than one setting of type for a daily
      newspaper if more copies were needed than could be printed on one press in eight or ten hours,
      i.e. 2000-2500 copies&mdash;or, by halfsheet imposition, 4000-5000 copies.</p>

     <p>Presumably the weekly <hi rend="italic">Cambridge Intelligencer</hi> (circulation not known)
      would never have required duplicate setting. And presumably the <hi rend="italic">Morning
       Chronicle</hi> in 1793-1795 and the <hi rend="italic">Morning Post</hi> in 1797-1802 (their
      Coleridge years) would not have required it for their normal circulations. The <hi
       rend="italic">Morning Post</hi> in 1802 boasted that its circulation had risen "from 400 to
      2100 per day" between 1795 and 1801 and again "from 2100 to 3500 per day" by December 3, 1802.
      The circulation of the <hi rend="italic">Morning Chronicle</hi> dropped below 2000 in 1802 and
      had probably not exceeded 3000 in the preceding decade. None of <pb n="011.146"/> these
      figures approaches the critical limit, <hi rend="italic">if</hi> halfsheet imposition was
      practicable. (<hi rend="italic">The Times</hi> is said to have used duplicate setting when the
      circulation exceeded 4500 copies, as it did not do before 1806.) But bibliographical
      information about the newspapers is so scanty that a thorough check was advised. (I am
      grateful to Eugene B. Vest and Gerald E. Bentley, Jr. for help with some of the
      collating.)</p>

     <p>Files of the <hi rend="italic">Cambridge Intelligencer</hi> in the British Museum (Duke
      University film), Oxford, and the University of Chicago were collated, leaving unexamined only
      the file at the Cambridge Public Library. Files of the <hi rend="italic">Morning
       Chronicle</hi> in Oxford, the Boston Public Library (Duke University film), and the
      University of Chicago were collated, leaving unexamined only one extensive file, the one at
      Cambridge University. Files of the <hi rend="italic">Morning Post</hi> in the British Museum
      (Duke University film), Oxford, the New York Historical Library, and the Newberry Library in
      Chicago were examined, leaving only the file which is listed in Ward as at Richmond, Virginia,
      but cannot now be located.</p>

     <p>In all cases the texts examined, in which typographical peculiarities such as broken letters
      were frequently noted, proved to be identical. The evidence appears conclusive that duplicate
      composition was not practised by the newspapers concerned at the dates in question. It thus
      seems safe to conclude that apparent errors in E. H. Coleridge are actual errors and not
      variants derived from variant printings.</p>

     <p>The few poems appearing in the <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> (on eleven scattered days
      between 1804 and 1818) are with one exception correctly collated by E. H. Coleridge; so the
      possibility that in the latter half of that period the <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> reached
      a circulation requiring multiple setting hardly concerns us. I have collated two or three
      copies for each of the days for which that many copies were available and found no variation,
      except that the <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> sometimes went into a "Second Edition" with one
      or two news paragraphs refreshed.</p>

     <p>Finally a word should be said about the text of the poems reprinted in 1850 in Sara
      Coleridge's third volume of Coleridge's <hi rend="italic">Essays on His Own Times</hi>.
      Although she claims to be reprinting these "as they originally appeared," her text is
      sometimes that of 1817 (<hi rend="italic">Recantation</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Parliamentary
       Oscillators</hi>); sometimes a doctored text (in "Hippona" the third line, "Whate'er
      obscenities you say," becomes "Whate'er men over boldly say"); but usually a text changed only
      in mechanics (for example <hi rend="italic">The Devil's Thoughts</hi> and most of the
      Epigrams). In spelling and punctuation she is more faithful than E. H. Coleridge to the
      newspaper, and her text does not seem to account for any of his errors.</p>

        Signed "S. T. C---RIDGE. <hi rend="italic">Ottery St. Mary</hi>." Discovered by Robert D.
        Mayo, who is to publish a full text elsewhere. This constitutes a second draft of <hi
         rend="italic">An Effusion at Evening written in August, 1792</hi> (E. H. C. pp. 49-50). The

       "favourite phrases" and of "flat lines forced into poetry by Italics," it is of some interest
       to know which words bore emphasis in the earliest printing, and which received emphasis only
       in subsequent texts.</item>

      <item>In <hi rend="italic">MM</hi>. the only italicized words are: 5 <hi rend="italic"
        >dampy</hi>, 13 <hi rend="italic">one . . . no</hi>; the only capitalized words are: 9
       Sorrow, 10 myself, 11 spirit. The same is true of the reprinting in the <hi rend="italic"
        >Poetical Register for 1803</hi> (1805). In the <hi rend="italic">Biographia Literaria</hi>,
       1817, a self-conscious Coleridge reprinted the sonnet with added italics and capitals thus: <list>
        <item>1 <hi rend="italic">hard</hi> world 2 <hi rend="italic">my poor</hi> heart . . .
         Moon</item>

        <item>6 <hi rend="italic">paly</hi> 7 <hi rend="italic">did pause me</hi> 8 <hi

        <item>14 <hi rend="italic">my poor heart's</hi> inexplicable Swell.</item>
       </list> At the same time he dropped Sorrow and spirit to plain sorrow and spirit. (All this
       is faithfully reproduced in the J. Shawcross edition of <hi rend="italic">Biographia
        Literaria</hi> [1907], I, 17.)</item>

      <item>Cottle, in the first posthumous reprinting, emphasized only: MYSELF, SPIRIT, <hi
        rend="italic">one . . . no-thing</hi>, and later editors generally followed suit. James
       Dykes Campbell in 1893 restored <hi rend="italic">dampy</hi> but reduced Sorrow, Myself,
       Spirit to simple capitalization. E.H.C. restores the emphases of 1817 with a careless hand,
       neglecting to italicize <hi rend="italic">breezy</hi> and <hi rend="italic">my</hi> (line 11)
       while adding an italic <hi rend="italic">I</hi> in line 7, dropping Moon down to Moon and
       Swell to swell, and tampering thus with lines 9 and 11: <q>
        <l>9 O'er the black heath of Sorrow <hi rend="italic">MM</hi></l>

        mentioned in the earlier account of the babe. The variants follow, except for mechanical

        >MP</hi> is lacking in the British Museum file. See E. H. C., pp. 382-384. Collation yields
       an introductory letter, some extra lines, and a long footnote containing an excerpt from
       Coleridge's translation of <hi rend="italic">Wallenstein</hi>, followed in turn by another
       note. The introduction reads: <q>Mr. Editor, The following Verses were composed before
        daylight, on the morning appointed for the departure of a very worthy, but not very
        pleasant, visitor; whom, it was feared, the rain might detain. If you give it a place in
        your paper, it must be under the title of<lb/> AN ODE TO THE RAIN.</q>
      </item>

      <item>
       <p>In the text Rain is always in capitals. Between lines 18 and 19 an extra couplet is found: <q>
         <l>18-19 [We] but ill agree:</l>
         <l>For days and months, and almost years <hi rend="italic">1817</hi>.</l>
         <l>as ill agree</l>
         <l>As fun'ral hymn with <hi rend="italic">Fal de ral</hi>:</l>
         <l>The Lord in Heav'n knows, when we shall!</l>
         <l>For days, <hi rend="italic">etc. MP</hi>.</l>
        </q> All other variants are merely in mechanics. But to "You're *" in line 32 is appended
        the following: <q>* Here is seems that the Poet, in a dreamlike mood of mind, well suited to
         a Poet composing verses in the dark with his eyes shut, begins to confound, and gradually
         to identify, the personified Rain with the person of the visitor. If authority were
         wanting, it might be found in the first scene of the last act of Wallenstein, where the
         idea of the planet, Jupiter, is confounded with that of the young hero, who, as well as
         Wallenstein, was born under that star. The whole passage is incomparably superior to any
         other of all Schiller's Works. <hi rend="italic">O si sic omnia</hi>. The passage is short,
         and deserves quotation: (Wallenstein <hi rend="italic">at the window</hi>.)</q>
        <q>There is a busy motion in the heav'n, <hi rend="italic">etc.</hi> [<hi rend="italic"
          >sic</hi>]</q> The passage corresponds to <hi rend="italic">Wallenstein</hi>, Act. V, Sc.
        i., lines 23-49 as published in 1800, with only one material variant: <list>
         <item>25 Fast sail the clouds <hi rend="italic">1800</hi>] Fast sweep <hi rend="italic"
           >MP</hi></item>
        </list>
        <pb n="011.159"/> The punctuation differs greatly; the stage directions are omitted between
        lines 31 and 32; and the passage from line 38 to line 49 is telescoped to: <list>
         <item><hi rend="italic">Countess</hi>. How?</item>

         <item><hi rend="italic">Wallenstein</hi>&mdash;He is gone&mdash;is dust!</item>

         <item><hi rend="italic">Countess</hi>.&mdash;Thou speak'st of Piccolomini, &amp;c.</item>
        </list> The note on "sickle" in line 25 does not appear, but at the end of the excerpt the
        following paragraph takes up the point made in that note: <q>If we recollect, that
         Wallenstein acted through the whole of his life, under the strongest influence of an
         astrological superstition, we shall not find it easy to admire this passage too highly.
         Some sapient Critics have charged the metaphor in the third and fourth lines of this
         quotation with an incongruity; but this must surely have been the consequence of their
         having neither seen the crescent moon in a cloudy, windy night, or a bright sickle at work
         in a corn field. A simile with greater similitude would scarcely be poetic.</q> (A pleasant

       from Byron's <hi rend="italic">Fugitive Pieces</hi>, capitalizing "let Sense and Truth
       unclue," though there are no capitals in the original, and then suggests that Coleridge
       "veiled his initials in the line, 'Let Sense and Truth unClue.'" The idiom "lament on" does
       not sound to me like Coleridge; I quite doubt the ascription. Incidentally the last line
       should read: "<hi rend="italic">We</hi> give the palm where Justice points it due" (not "its

     <head/>
     <p>ESPECIALLY IN NEW ENGLAND, THE PRINTED SERMON of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries
      served other purposes aside from the theological. While it was primarily a lecture on moral
      conduct, it also marked important political occasions, memorialized the dead, and sometimes
      functioned as a newspaper in reporting and editorializing on current events. As Holmes points
      out, the first generation of Massachusetts preachers sermonized on church doctrine, polity,
      and homiletics, but in the second generation the preachers "began to point their morals and to
      illustrate their sermons with the news of temporal occurrences and events; and even to adopt
      the more impressive of occasional events as topics for their sermons."<ref target="f011.11.01"
       n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref> Thus our early sermons added the spice of immediate
      excitement such as hangings, earthquakes, ship explosions, and elections to their routine
      theological subject matter&mdash;what is Right or Wrong, Good or Bad, and the Ways of God to
      Man.</p>


     <p>Sales varied according to the interest a sermon aroused: Cotton Mather's sermon on the
      earthquake of 1727 achieved three editions and Thomas Prince's sermon on the same catastrophe
      had two editions; but a sermon on the death of a parishioner, or a homily on the public spirit
      that should be evoked on Election Day attracted few readers, too few, in fact, for publishing
      at a profit. When such sermons appeared&mdash;and they were numerous&mdash;their expenses were
      underwritten by a relative, friends, or a corporate body. Between the best sellers and the
      worst, there was yet another type that could be marketed with fair prospect of small gain to
      the publisher who, at times, was the author himself.</p>

     <p>Here in our early history is a microcosm of present-day publishing&mdash; <pb n="011.164"/>
      ranging from pre-established successes to what we now call vanity publishing. Although this
      may also be true for other classes of literature in Calvinist New England, nowhere except in
      the class of sermons is there so much evidence relating to the financing of publications.</p>

     <p>Unfortunately, it is not always possible to determine the financial sponsor by looking at
      the imprint. Books printed "for John Usher" were not always sponsored by him.<ref
       target="f011.11.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref> Nor were all books printed "upon
      Assignment of Samuel Sewall" printed at Sewall's expense.<ref target="f011.11.03" n="3"><hi
        rend="super">3</hi></ref> Additional information lies in the diaries, memoirs, public
      documents, archives, and occasionally on the title-page of the publication itself.</p>



     <p>When Lindsay Swift prepared his comprehensive survey of Massachusetts Election Sermons, he
      turned to public documents and found, for example, that when Richard Mather delivered his
      Election Sermon in 1644, the General Court voted that "the printer shall have leave to print
      the election sermon, w<hi rend="super">th</hi> M<hi rend="super">r</hi> Mathers consent, &amp;
      the artillery sermon, w<hi rend="super">th</hi> M<hi rend="super">r</hi> Nortons consent."<ref target="f011.11.04" n="4"><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref> 
      Whether or not this permission
      implies a censorship is not germane; it is clear that the General Court did not plan to pay
      for printing the Election Sermon and, as a matter of fact, it probably never reached print.
      Five years later, Thomas Cobbett, who delivered the Election Sermon, was told by the Court
      that "it is their desire he would print it heere or elsuhere" (Swift, p. 395). As no copy has
      survived, it is presumed that this, too, did not find a printer. Not until the 1660's were
      Massachusetts Election Sermons printed, and then at private expense even though the preacher
      was requested to prepare a copy for the press. In 1668, this request was made of William
      Stoughton, but when the sermon was printed two years later, the Advertisement mentioned a
      "Person of Worth" who adventured the publishing (Swift, p. 399). The New Plymouth Colony, on
      the other hand, voted to print Thomas Walley's Election Sermon of 1669.<ref
       target="f011.11.05" n="5"><hi rend="super">5</hi></ref> Still Massachusetts continued its
      policy of making no provision for printing or honorarium and it was not until the middle of
      the next decade that the policy of the General Court began to change. On May 27, 1674, it
      ordered "that the Reuerend M<hi rend="super">r</hi>. Samuel Torrey &amp; M<hi rend="super"
       >r</hi>. Joshua Moody be thanked from this Court for the great &amp; very acceptable pajnes
      which they tooke in their late election sermons, and that they be desired to print their sajd
      sermons w<hi rend="super">th</hi> as much <pb n="011.165"/> speed as may be . . . ."<ref
       target="f011.11.06" n="6"><hi rend="super">6</hi></ref> A year later, on May 12, 1675, it
      declared that "In consideration of the Reuerend M<hi rend="super">r</hi>. Torrey his charge in
      printing his election sermon, the Court judgeth it meet to give him fiue pounds out of the
      publick tresury, to reimburse his charge therein" (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>, V, 32).
      Though a first step had at last been taken, the Court did not immediately decide to pay for
      the printing of future sermons so that Joshua Moody, who delivered the Election Sermon in
      1675, was, as usual, requested "to transcribe a copy thereof meete for the presse, that it may
      be printed" (Swift, p. 402). In 1683, however, the General Court ordered payment to Samuel
      Sewall for Samuel Torrey's Election Sermon;<ref target="f011.11.07" n="7"><hi rend="super"
        >7</hi></ref> in the following year John Hale's Election Sermon was ordered printed "at the
      publick charge" (Swift, p. 405). The General Court continued this custom when it approved the
      sermon and in such instances the sermon was printed upon receipt of fair copy. Sometimes the
      size of edition varied according to the Court's opinion of the virtue of the discourse. In
      1701, the Court ordered five hundred copies of Joseph Belcher's Election Sermon, but in the
      following year it ordered merely one hundred copies of Increase Mather's (<hi rend="italic"
       >Holmes IM</hi>, I, 250, 254).</p>





     <p>Perhaps the best-known private organization which maintained the custom of Election Sermons
      is the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company. Although most of its early records were lost
      in the fire of 1761, two volumes still exist in Faneuil Hall.<ref target="f011.11.08" n="8"
        ><hi rend="super">8</hi></ref> Examinations of these records reveals that in 1737, if not
      before, the Company paid for the printing of its Election Sermon. Two years later, the Company
      not only voted to print the sermon of 1739, but also to present the Governor and every member
      of the General Assembly with a copy and to present every member of the Company with two
      copies. A similar measure was passed the following year. According to the records, many of the
      Election Sermons after 1741 were printed by subscription, but even in such instances the
      Company seems to have been financially responsible. On September 5, 1763, it voted that "the
      Clerk settle with Mess<hi rend="super">r</hi>. Edes &amp; Gill for the last Artillery Election
      Sermon which was preach'd by the Rev<hi rend="super">d</hi>. M<hi rend="super">r</hi>. Tho<hi
       rend="super">s</hi>. Balch &amp; pay them for the Remainder of the 300 sermons that were not
      subscribed for &amp; also that the Clerk sell them to any of the Company at eight pence each."
      While maintaining <pb n="011.166"/> a subscription basis for many of its sermons, the Company
      seems to have varied the procedure when conditions warranted. In June, 1788, the Company voted
      to procure two hundred copies of David Osgood's Election Sermon; the following September, it
      voted that "each Member shall pay One Shilling and Six pence for two of Sermons preached by
       Rev<hi rend="super">d</hi>. D. Osgood at the Anniversary and Six pence apiece for as many
      more as they may see proper to take." In 1789, the Company evidently had greater confidence in
      the success of that year's sermon; it voted "to print the Rev<hi rend="super">d</hi>. M<hi
       rend="super">r</hi>. Barnard's Sermon by Subscription."</p>


     <p>If any generalization may be derived from these scattered data, it is that printing of
      Election Sermons with public or organizational funds was not a purely automatic process. It
      developed over a period of forty years and even when established depended upon approval of
      text, preparation of the manuscript, and financial resources. Since copies of the sermons were
      allotted rather than sold, circulation, if not reading, was assured.</p>

     <p>Another class of sermons, those discussing contemporary events or those on non-resistance to
      sin and the damnation that was inexorable could be profitably marketed by
      bookseller-publishers astute enough to assume the financing. When James Morgan was executed
      for murder in 1686, John Dunton, who had just arrived in Boston, was quick to seize the
      opportunity of publishing Increase Mather's sermon on the occasion. Issued in partnership with
      Joseph Brunning, the pamphlet went into a second edition the following year. The success of
      such ventures encouraged printers and publishers to engage in enterprises which were based
      upon enthusiasm rather than editorial skill&mdash;an occupational hazard of the publishing
      industry. Isaiah Thomas, writing about Timothy Green, said, "It has been said of him, that
      whenever he heard a sermon which he highly approved, he would solicit a copy from the author,
      and print it for his own sales. This honest zeal in the cause of religion often proved
      injurious to his interest. Large quantities of these sermons lay on hand as dead stock; and,
      after his decease, they were put into baskets, appraised by the bushel, and sold under the
      value of common waste paper."<ref target="f011.11.09" n="9"><hi rend="super">9</hi></ref> It
      is probable that some members of the book trade placed shorthand writers in the audience when
      an unusually promising sermon was about to be delivered. Increase Mather, in <hi rend="italic"
       >The Righteous Man a Blessing</hi> (1702), wrote: "These Sermons were Preached at the <hi
       rend="italic">Lecture</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Boston</hi>. Having been informed that many
      who live in the Country, as well as in this Town, have <pb n="011.167"/> desired they might be
      published, and one who took in Short hand what I delivered, having shewed me his transcribed
      Copy, I have perused it, and consented to its being sent to the Press" (<hi rend="italic"
       >Holmes IM</hi>, I, 254). Certainly this smacks of a publisher's scheme. And Holmes suggests
      that it may have been Samuel Phillips, the publisher, who inspired a shorthand writer to take
      down a sermon delivered by Increase Mather in 1695 (<hi rend="italic">Holmes IM</hi>, II,
      612). These examples show that the publishing of this class of sermons was lucrative enough to
      warrant aggressiveness in securing copy.</p>


     <p>But for memorial sermons honoring the lesser-known dead subsidizing was usually necessary.
      As early as 1660, according to Winship, the memory of a deceased pastor was honored by
      printing his last sermon or two. Winship also points out that "It was customary long afterward
      for such a publication to be seen to the press by a committee representing the parish, and for
      one member to dominate its action and often to pay the bill" (Winship, p. 261). The pastor's
      final sermon was not the only way of honoring his memory; instead, his funeral sermon at times
      served the purpose. In 1717, for instance, the people of Salem Village published Joseph
      Capen's funeral sermon on their deceased pastor, Joseph Green (<hi rend="italic">Holmes
       IM</hi>, II, 583). This custom of paying for the printing of a funeral sermon prevailed as
      well in the more prosperous families. A typical bill, written in 1748, still exists: <q>The
       Estate of the Hon. Anthony Stoddard, Esq. Deceased, to Sam<hi rend="super">l</hi>. Kneeland,
        D<hi rend="super">r</hi>.</q>
      <q>To paper, printing &amp;c. of 300 of the Rev<hi rend="super">d</hi>. M<hi rend="super"
        >r</hi>. Princes Sermon, on the Death of Madam Stoddard, his Consort, at 3<hi rend="super"
        >s</hi>
       <hi rend="italic">per</hi> Book, old Tenor} &pound;45 00 00 Errors Excepted,<lb/>
       <hi rend="italic">per</hi> Sam<hi rend="super">l</hi>. Kneeland<ref target="f011.11.10"
        n="10"><hi rend="super">10</hi></ref></q> Throughout the eighteenth and into the nineteenth
      centuries, groups or individuals continued to pay for memorials. To honor people of
      exceptionally high civic status, the authorities not only paid the printing cost but also
      presented a copy to each family within the town; this was done with the funeral sermon for
      Nathaniel Gorham in 1786<ref target="f011.11.11" n="11"><hi rend="super">11</hi></ref>
      However, the most extensive demonstration of this practice occurred after the death of George
      Washington when town after town acclaimed <pb n="011.168"/> him. It is interesting to note
      that even more sermons should have been printed if there had not been such a surfeit of them.
      In Salem, for instance, William Bentley delivered the official oration on Washington which was
      to have been printed at the expense of the town. Bentley duly recorded this in his diary: "The
      Town at their adjournment have voted to raise in Salem 6000 D. to be appropriated in funeral
      &amp; other honours to Gen. Washington. Only 100 copies of the Sermon are to be printed at the
      expence of Salem &amp; of these, 10 copies are to be given to each of the 6 ministers &amp;
      the remaining 40 to be left with the keeper of the Social Library to be lent to such as cannot
      purchase."<ref target="f011.11.12" n="12"><hi rend="super">12</hi></ref> Eight days later he
      wrote: "In proposing to print all the Sermons of Salem, the Town has tied a Stone to their
      Oration &amp; has sunk it forever" (Bentley, II, 328). His sermon did not reach a printer, but
      at least five others delivered in Salem did so. This is not surprising because the
      biographical and historical information they contained attracted many readers.</p>




     <p>The works of Cotton Mather, that passionate pamphleteer, afford the best conspectus of the
      many methods of financing sermon publication. Mather, of course, considered the printed sermon
      a most important part of his evangelical work. Mere publication did not satisfy him; he worked
      ardently to circulate his theories of the struggle between temptation and conscience.
      Referring to one of his sermons, he declared in his diary that "the Sermon will be an
      agreeable Engine for me to employ on many Occasions, when Books of Piety are to be dispensed."<ref target="f011.11.13" n="13"><hi rend="super">13</hi></ref> 
      On days of his pastoral
      visits, he usually gave away a half a dozen books (<hi rend="italic">CM Diary</hi>, I, 518);
      he also placed them on outgoing vessels (<hi rend="italic">CM Diary</hi>, II, 14). In 1705/6,
      he stated that he gave away at least six hundred books a year (<hi rend="italic">CM
      Diary</hi>, I, 548). For one book, <hi rend="italic">Family Religion</hi>, Mather ordered a
      thousand copies. He tied them into bundles and "concerted with some of my Friends a way to
      convey a Bundle to every Town in all these Colonies, and unto some other Places."<ref
       target="f011.11.14" n="14"><hi rend="super">14</hi></ref> To make certain of sufficient
      material always at hand, he employed a variety of devices to secure publication.</p>



     <p>References in Mather's diary imply that some of the more popular sermons were issued at the
      financial risk of the bookseller-publishers. When John Baily died in 1697, Mather preached on
      the day of the funeral: <hi rend="italic">A Good Man Making A Good End</hi>. In his diary,
      Mather <pb n="011.169"/> wrote: "The Publication of this Discourse was much Desired; so I gave
      it unto the Book-sellers" (<hi rend="italic">CM Diary</hi>, I, 245). Similar passages relate
      to other sermons of obvious popular appeal. In 1697/8, "some of my Neighbours, (and some, from
      whom I little expected any such Respect,) call for the Discourse, which I lately uttered, at
       <hi rend="italic">Boston-Lecture</hi>, after that a great part of the Town, as well as
      myself, had recovered from our late Illness. Accordingly in Peece of a Day or two, I fitted
      the Discourse for the Press, and gave it unto the Bookseller" (<hi rend="italic">CM
      Diary</hi>, I, 254). And, later in 1698, "The Sermon, I gave to the Book-seller; and annexed
      thereunto, an History of <hi rend="italic">Criminals</hi> executed in this Land, and
      effectually, an Account of their dying Speeches, and of my own Discourses with them in their
      last Hours; hoping to warn others against Vice, by an History thus accomodated unto the
      purpose" (<hi rend="italic">CM Diary</hi>, I, 279-280). The following year, when he delivered
      the Boston Lecture, he was pleased to note: "And, behold, as I come out of the Meeting-house,
      the Book-sellers come to mee, entreating that they may have a Copy of these two Sermons, when
      the next shall bee delivered, for to bee published unto the Countrey" (<hi rend="italic">CM
       Diary</hi>, I, 296-297). More examples could be cited, but the best demonstration of their
      financial success appears in an incident which occurred in 1717 when Mather published <hi
       rend="italic">The Valley of Hinnom</hi>, delivered just before the execution of Jeremiah
      Fenwick who murdered his neighbor: "I gave to the Bookseller my Essay upon, <hi rend="italic"
       >The valley of Hinnom</hi>. I was desirous at the same time, to have had him taken another
      Discourse for the <hi rend="italic">Cure of Ungoverned Anger</hi>. He declined it, and I was
      easy; my Discourse must ly by under a Sentence of Death; my Labour be buried. But in five
      Dayes time, the Bookseller sells off an Impression of near a thousand which he printed of the
      former Essay; and now he comes to me for the Latter" (<hi rend="italic">CM Diary</hi>, II,
      462). The publisher's lukewarm manner was readily familiar to Mather, but true to the drive of
      his violent soul he sternly expended more vigorous effort to continue publishing his message.
      If circumstances allowed, Mather would plan to purchase a number of copies and probably
      informed the bookseller of his intention. Before <hi rend="italic">Unum Necessarium</hi>
      appeared in 1693, he promised, himself at least, that "for the two Years, next ensuing, if I
      lived, I would of those <hi rend="italic">Books</hi>, buy from the <hi rend="italic"
       >Book-seller</hi>, after the rate of <hi rend="italic">two</hi> a Week" (<hi rend="italic">CM
       Diary</hi>, I, 156). When <hi rend="italic">Cares About the Nurseries</hi> was finished in
      1701/2, Mather "gave it unto the Bookseller; with Resolutions, that when it is published, I
      will take off two or three every Week" (<hi rend="italic">CM Diary</hi>, I, 421). Seven years
      later, when <hi rend="italic">The Cure of Sorrow</hi> went to the publisher, Mather planned
      "immediately to purchase <pb n="011.170"/> forty-shillings worth of them, (and afterwards, if
      I live, many more,) to be dispersed among the Afflicted" (<hi rend="italic">CM Diary</hi>, II,
      21). In 1722, he supplied fifty shillings toward the publication of <hi rend="italic">The
       Minister</hi> and wrote to Thomas Prince expressing the intention of sending copies to
      Connecticut and some of the more southern provinces as soon as he received his fifty
      shillings' worth (<hi rend="italic">CM Diary</hi>, II, 684-685).</p>

     <p>Occasionally Mather would even publish a volume at his own expense. After his son Increase
      was lost at sea, Mather wrote: "I took the Sermon I preached on that Occasion, adding to it
      another that is agreeable; and with a considerable Expence enabled the Bookseller to publish
      them" (<hi rend="italic">CM Diary</hi>, II, 776). But it must be noted that the book finally
      appeared in an expanded form: "While it was, in the Press (which also was in this Month) a
      strange Hand of Providence made such an Accession from others, to my own Disbursements, that I
      could add a third Sermon, to the Book, wherein I may yett more notably serve the Designs of
      Piety" (<hi rend="italic">CM Diary</hi>, II, 776-777).</p>

     <p>The resources used by Mather to publish his sermons extended far beyond his own limits; an
      impressive number were underwritten by individuals and groups. Since the list of these is
      greater than realized, examples are presented in Table I. Examining it, one can see the
      extreme diversity of sponsors as well as the varieties of sponsorship which range from
      contribution of paper to payment for the entire edition. Such aid did not always come
      unsolicited; extant documents prove that Mather at times aggressively promoted publication.
      Writing to John Winthrop after he spoke at the funeral of Winthrop's uncle, he asked for
      publication of the sermon: "I confess freely to you, That, contrary to my usual conduct on
      such Occasions, (which is, To stay till such a thing be Desired by others,) I have myself
      Desired, and I do again Request, the publication of it."<ref target="f011.11.15" n="15"><hi
        rend="super">15</hi></ref> In 1712, he even prepared the draft of a letter which he asked
      Samuel Penhallow to write to Thomas Archer seeking "a generous Tender of three or four pounds"
      towards the printing of <hi rend="italic">Pastoral Desires</hi> (<hi rend="italic">CM
       Diary</hi>, II, 170). After two friends had offered to pay part of the cost of <hi
       rend="italic">The Minister</hi>, Mather wrote to Thomas Prince: "If now I can gett the
      Assistence of but 50s or 3<hi rend="super">d</hi> subscribed, I can, I suppose gett thro' the
      rest of the Expence which the Desired Publication may call for. Wherefore, I will be so rude,
      as to leave it with you, to Consult with our dear <hi rend="italic">Cooper</hi> and <hi
       rend="italic">Foxcroft</hi>" (<hi rend="italic">CM Diary</hi>, II, 684).</p>


     <p>This rather particular investigation of one man's extraordinary efforts to publish his
      sermons may be atypical but it does confirm the <pb n="011.171"/> diversity of financing
      utilized in publication. Whereas some sermons were completely financed by a publisher or
      sponsor, others would have never been issued were it not for the informal cooperation of
      individuals.</p>

     <p>Many sermons of this period carry phrases like "Published by request" on the title-pages.
      These words are no more meaningful than "by popular demand" today. Nevertheless, in many cases
      it is possible to ascertain that the audience actually did, for one reason or another,
      subsidize publication. As early as 1682, some members of the Second Church paid for Increase
      Mather's <hi rend="italic">Practical Truths;</hi><ref target="f011.11.16" n="16"><hi rend="super">16</hi></ref> 
      twenty-five years later, some
      hearers contributed towards the printing of his <hi rend="italic">Meditations on Death</hi>
       (<hi rend="italic">Holmes IM</hi>, I, 329). As shown in Table I, Cotton Mather's parishioners
      were sometimes equally generous, but their generosity was not limited to their own preacher.
      When James Pierpont of New Haven occupied Cotton Mather's pulpit in 1711, some of the
      listeners published Pierpont's sermon (<hi rend="italic">Holmes CM</hi>, II, 835). To cite one
      more example, Increase Mather's preface to <hi rend="italic">A Monitor for Delaying
       Sinners</hi> (1719) by Thomas Symmes states that "His Auditors were so affected with it, as
      to importune him to grant them a Copy of his Discourse in order to its [<hi rend="italic"
       >sic</hi>] Publication by the Press" (<hi rend="italic">Holmes IM</hi>, II, 443). During the
      eighteenth century, evidence of this kind occasionally appears on the title-page in phrases
      like "Published at the desire and expence of some of the hearers" or "Published at the desire
      and expence of said society." Churches, conventions, and societies often paid for the
      publication of sermons, particularly those for ordinations, anniversaries, and other
      commemorative events. Writing to Ezra Stiles about the sermon at a convention in 1767, John
      Devotion succintly described the procedure: "Our first Business was to thank him in Convention
      &amp; ask a Copy, and Money was subscribed and paid in Hand."<ref target="f011.11.17" n="17"
        ><hi rend="super">17</hi></ref> But, in addition to these official publications, the members
      of a church or society were willing to subscribe for particularly soul-stirring ones. Now and
      then, an individual paid the entire cost: Increase Mather's <hi rend="italic">A Call to the
       Tempted</hi> was printed posthumously in 1723/4 at the expense of Samuel Sewall (<hi
       rend="italic">Holmes IM</hi>, I, 98); Nathaniel Appleton's Thanksgiving sermon on the repeal
      of the Stamp Act was published in 1766 "by the desire of the audience, and at the expence of
      the honorable Brigadier General Brattle;"<ref target="f011.11.18" n="18"><hi rend="super"
        >18</hi></ref> Cotton Mather's <hi rend="italic">The Everlasting Gospel</hi> was <pb
       n="011.172"/> reprinted in Philadelphia in 1767 because Mrs. Elizabeth Hobbs "in her last
      Will order'd, that a Number of them should be printed and dispersed, according to Directions
      therein given, <hi rend="italic">gratis</hi>" (<hi rend="italic">Holmes CM</hi>, I, 342).</p>




     <p>While discussing sermons as staple issues of the colonial press, Wroth mentions that "the
      printing of sermons as a private enterprise by the preachers themselves assumed in New England
      the proportions of a trade."<ref target="f011.11.19" n="19"><hi rend="super">19</hi></ref> The
      minister, establishing the probable sale by circulation of subscription papers, negotiated
      with the printers for terms of mutual benefit. If the minister happened to reside at a
      distance from the printer, a colleague might negotiate for him. Charles Chauncy did this for
      Ezra Stiles in 1761. Writing to Stiles from Boston, Chauncy reported: "I have put your Sermon
       [<hi rend="italic">A Discourse on the Christian Union</hi>] into the hands of Edes and Gill.
      They have engaged to deliver to you 300 copies well printed upon good paper for 75 Dollars.
      Draper would not do it under 80."<ref target="f011.11.20" n="20"><hi rend="super"
       >20</hi></ref> Chauncy, by the way, ordered an extra two hundred copies for distribution in
      Connecticut. When Stiles visited Boston five years later, Edes &amp; Gill told him that "they
      printed between Seven &amp; Eight Hundred Copies of my Sermon, sold them &amp; had none
      left&mdash;&amp; said they made more by it than was ever made in Boston by one Sermon, and
      would readily now print a new Edition if any body would engage 200 Copies."<ref
       target="f011.11.21" n="21"><hi rend="super">21</hi></ref> David McClure, in 1779, performed a
      similar service for Jeremy Belknap: <q>I am desired to inform [you] that the preparations for
       printing your sermon are in forwardness. M<hi rend="super">r</hi> Fowle has undertaken to
       print it in Portsm<hi rend="super">o</hi>. There are about one hundred subscribed for in this
       place. Subscriptions must circulate in neighbouring towns. Setting the press for 100 will
       turn out 6/ <hi rend="italic">per</hi> p<hi rend="super">t</hi> exclusive of paper; 200, 4/;
       300, 3/; what the expense of paper will be I have not heard.</q>
      <q>You will please to forward the copy to the printer as soon as convenient. They determine to
       go thro' with it should no more subscribers offer.<ref target="f011.11.22" n="22"><hi
         rend="super">22</hi></ref></q> Belknap conducted such transactions in a businesslike
      manner. Writing to Ebenezer Hazard in Philadelphia on October 27, 1792, he discussed plans for
      his discourse on the discovery of America: <q>You there advised me to print "a large edition"
       of my <hi rend="italic">Century</hi> Sermon, a subscription for which is now filling very
       fast in this town. I had thoughts of printing about 1,100, but have been persuaded to
       increase it to 1,500. <pb n="011.173"/> Brother Morse, who you know is very sanguine, says 2
       or 3,000; but I am not so much of an adventurer as he is. However, I suppose 1,500 will be
       the number, and that they will be finished in about three weeks. I shall send some to you,
       for Dobson to sell. It is <hi rend="italic">possible</hi>, I say <hi rend="italic"
        >possible</hi>, that more may be wanted in Philadelphia than I shall send; and, if so,
       perhaps it may not be improper for you to suggest to Dobson that he might venture an edition
       there, with my permission. Should this idea be acceptable, I now give you full power to agree
       with him on terms, as my attorney or agent, only with this exception, that I do not wish to
       take my share in books or sheets, because I can have enough more printed here, if they are
       wanted.<ref target="f011.11.23" n="23"><hi rend="super">23</hi></ref></q></p>






     <p>When the Society for Propagating the Gospel Among the Indians reprinted sermons by Belknap
      and Thomas Tayler, it was Belknap who arranged matters with the printer. Fortunately, the
      manuscript of the contract has been preserved: <q>Memorandum&mdash;I the subscriber promise to
        M<hi rend="super">r</hi> Jeremy Belknap that I will print five hundred Copies of his Sermon
       on 1 Corinthians 3.11. on Crown paper &amp; with a Pica type &amp; will deliver them to his
       order stitched in blue paper covers at three pence three farthings each Copy, provided the
       said Sermon can be comprehended in two sheets&mdash;&amp; at four pence each Copy provided it
       do not exceed two sheets &amp; a quarter.</q>
      <q>I also promise to print a Sermon on Mark 2.27 by T Tayler with the addition of two prayers
       for the Lords day by M<hi rend="super">r</hi> Henry&mdash;in the same manner &amp; on the
       same Terms.&mdash;</q>
      <q>I further promise that I will print any additional Number of each of the said Sermons on
       paper delivered to me by said Belknap, for eight shillings for every hundred copies to be
       delivered in sheets, and that I will print no more copies of the said first mentioned Sermon
       than those which are contracted for by said Belknap &amp; delivered to his order.</q>
      <q>Sam<hi rend="super">1</hi>. Hall</q>
      <q>Boston June 1. 1792.<ref target="f011.11.24" n="24"><hi rend="super">24</hi></ref></q></p>


     <p>If more contracts had survived, it might have been possible to determine the material
      rewards which accrued to the authors of these pamphlets. Though the publication of sermons
      was, at times, a trade, the process was probably not very lucrative for the American preacher
      of the eighteenth century. As late as 1791, William Bentley was surprised to learn that
      fifteen hundred copies of John Murray's sermon on Blind Prince were engaged&mdash;"our best
      sermons commonly rise no higher than 400 at an impression" (Bentley, I, 251). This, of course,
      is a number much too small to yield much money. As for official or organizational sermons,
      author's copies might or might not be provided. <pb n="011.174"/> Daniel Henchman, calculating
      his costs for printing the Artillery Company Election Sermons in 1735 and 1736, set aside
      fifty copies of each for the author;<ref target="f011.11.25" n="25"><hi rend="super"
       >25</hi></ref> the very incomplete records of the Company indicate that each of the preachers
      for 1737 and 1790 also received fifty copies. It is probable that the custom prevailed in
      other years, too. The figure of fifty appears to be standard throughout the eighteenth century
      for organizations which conducted their work with proper care. In 1787, Ezra Stiles recorded a
      gift of fifty copies of his ordination sermon for Henry Channing,<ref target="f011.11.26"
       n="26"><hi rend="super">26</hi></ref> and three years later William Bentley (I, 205) noted
      that he had received fifty copies of his sermon preached at the Stone Chapel in Boston. The
      attitude of other people, however, was sometimes rather cavalier. Belknap told Hazard his
      difficulty in obtaining copies of his New Hampshire Election Sermon for 1785: "I know not by
      what policy my quota of copies was detained from me; but, after trying several ways to get
      them, in vain, I at length made use of a person whom I knew to be indefatigable in the pursuit
      of any and every thing he undertakes; and, by his means, I got 20 copies".<ref
       target="f011.11.27" n="27"><hi rend="super">27</hi></ref> And, under entry for January 28,
      1797, William Bentley's diary (II, 212) emphasizes a similar disappointment: "Received thus
      late a few copies of my Discourse at Roxbury." Mindful of the time spent in preparing the
      sermons, of the time spent in travel to deliver them and then to return home, of the
      rudenesses accepted with dignity, one cannot help but have increased admiration for these
      sturdy and pious men.</p>




     <p>By these economics, the New England colonist was supplied with much of his reading matter.
      Perhaps the most striking conclusion to be drawn from an investigation such as this is that,
      with one qualification, the procedures for financing the publication of sermons in the
      seventeenth and eighteenth centuries survive in America today. In the last century, Edward
      Everett Hale conducted his own publishing firm for the sale of his sermons,<ref
       target="f011.11.28" n="28"><hi rend="super">28</hi></ref> but, of course, few ministers
      publish their own sermons today. However, the parallel still holds, for memorial volumes are
      still issued by the family of the departed, churches still <pb n="011.175"/> print their
      important sermons, and publishers still seek the manuscripts of popular preachers like Harry
      Emerson Fosdick and Norman Vincent Peale.</p>

     <head/>
     <p>SOME SEVENTY-TWO YEARS AGO C. R. HILDEBURN, at work on his compilation of Colonial
      Pennsylvania imprints, saw clearly that if a scholar were to identify the mass of unsigned
      presswork issuing from the shop of Benjamin Franklin, he must first study the distinctive type
      which Franklin and his fellow craftsmen used. The state of printing in the Middle Colonies
      made the conditions for such a study unusually favorable. In the early and middle decades of
      the eighteenth century there were seldom more than a half-dozen important printers at work in
      this whole cluster of Middle Provinces. The individual printer's array of type sizes was
      limited, his fonts usually quite different from those of his competitors, and his use of the
      same letter consistent over long years because type then was particularly hard to come by and
      costly and difficult to replace.</p>

     <p>Studying Franklin bibliography was not, however, Hildeburn's prime concern; he was engaged
      in a pioneering venture of far wider scope and in the end attempted to identify all the
      unsigned Pennsylvania presswork from that of William Bradford's lone press in 1685 to that
      issued by the numerous printers of the Post-Revolutionary Era.<ref target="f011.12.01" n="1"
        ><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref> His contribution to Franklin studies was nevertheless the
      first major one, and both Charles Evans in the first four volumes of his <hi rend="italic"
       >American Bibliography</hi> (1903-04) and W. J. Campbell in his <hi rend="italic">Short-title
       Checklist of Franklin Imprints</hi> (1918) have accepted as authoritative Hildeburn's
      ascriptions of unsigned items to Franklin.</p>


     <p>In a project so ambitious as that undertaken by Hildeburn, inaccuracies are almost
      inevitable, and recent research has shown them to be serious enough in Franklin bibliography
      alone to force a restudy of that material. Hildeburn, understandably, missed both signed and
       <pb n="011.180"/> unsigned Franklin printing which has since come to light, but in addition
      he mistook Baskerville type for Caslon and hence ascribed to Franklin's press work which must
      have been done at least fifty years later. He identified type as Franklin's, which was not in
      his shop or in that of his competitors. He assumed that Franklin had a monopoly on government
      printing in the Province and ignored type evidence which indicated otherwise, and left unnoted
      printing done by Franklin but signed by fellow craftsmen. In short, Hildeburn did not pursue
      his type studies systematically or apply consistently his knowledge. And in his work on
      Sewel's <hi rend="italic">History of the Quakers</hi> (1728) he failed to perceive that his
      type knowledge was the only tool by which he could solve his bibliographical problem.<ref
       target="f011.12.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref></p>


     <p>Hildeburn's most significant contribution to Franklin then, perhaps, is his demonstrating
      the fruitfulness of his approach through a knowledge of type, and for the student intent on
      studying anew the whole of Franklin's printing and publishing activities, as I am, the goal is
      clearly to move in the direction which Hildeburn has indicated and hope to avoid his
      errors.</p>


     <p>The type which Franklin owned falls into three divisions: (1) the variety of letter which he
      used at the Passy press during his sojourn in France from 1776 to 1785 and later brought back
      to America and sold in part to the New York printer Francis Childs; (2) the arrays of fonts
      with which Franklin stocked the houses of his numerous printing partners at work in colonies
      other than Pennsylvania, within the Province of Pennsylvania but not in Philadelphia, or
      within Philadelphia but printing in German rather than English; and (3) the large body of type
      which Franklin used in his original printing house established in Philadelphia in the spring
      of 1728 and relinquished in January of 1766 to David Hall, the reliable Scotsman whom he had
      taken into partnership eighteen years before in 1748.</p>

     <p>This present paper deals exclusively with the type last mentioned &mdash; that with which
      Franklin started his career and that used later in the same shop by Franklin and Hall trading
      as partners. The objectives of the study are principally historical and descriptive. Mr.
      Lawrence C. Wroth has succeeded admirably in indicating generally where the colonial American
      printer acquired his type, how much he bought, what sometimes it cost, and how he used it.<ref
       target="f011.12.03" n="3"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref> This paper will offer the fuller
      information on these points to be gleaned from an intensive <pb n="011.181"/> study of a
      single eminent and very enterprising colonial printer like Franklin. The other objective, and
      as an aid in future research far the more important, is the identification and cataloguing of
      all of Franklin's type, establishing approximate terminal dates for the use of various fonts
      and finally supplying plates of each of Franklin's text types together with selected examples
      of the differing faces used in the shops of his competitors.</p>


     <p>The resources for carrying on this Franklin investigation, despite my evident inability to
      find conclusive answers for all the important questions, are extraordinary &mdash; richer
      certainly than those for any other colonial American printer practising his craft in the
      middle decades of the eighteenth century &mdash; and perhaps because of their odd variety
      merit a comment at the outset. The single most important material is, of course, the large
      amount of extant printed matter issuing from Franklin's shop: the weekly issues of his
      newspaper, <hi rend="italic">The Pennsylvania Gazette</hi>, and the more than 500 preserved
      Franklin imprints. Next in significance are the revealing observations in the <hi
       rend="italic">Autobiography</hi> and scattered comments among the thousands of published
      Franklin letters, especially those in the Strahan-Hall-Franklin correspondences. The important
      new material, much of it previously unstudied, is the David Hall manuscripts &mdash; a series
      of letter books covering the entire period of the Franklin-Hall partnership, business papers
      of Hall and of Franklin and Hall recently rediscovered, and a few important new Franklin-Hall
      letters not known before to exist. Related to these, and ideally suited for this study are the
      papers of James Parker, Franklin's former printing partner in New York City, commissioned as
      the agent of Franklin during his stay in London, to reach an equitable settlement with Hall
      upon termination of the Franklin-Hall partnership. The key document is an itemized list of the
      firm's complete type holdings in January of 1766, by size, weight, state of wear, and
      estimated monetary value.</p>

    <div2 id="vol011.12.02" type="section" n="2">
     <head/>
     <p>In the fall of 1724 Franklin took ship for London where he would be "on the Spot . . . to
      chuse the Types &amp; see that everything was good of the kind"<ref target="f011.12.04" n="4"
        ><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref> for the little printing house which Governor Keith of
      Pennsylvania had urged him to set up in Philadelphia and declared himself willing to
      underwrite. Within days after his arrival Franklin came to understand the nature of the
      governor's promises, that they <pb n="011.182"/> were well intentioned but hollow, and to
      perceive that he was not to have a shop of his own as he had imagined. Further, except out of
      curiosity he was now under no compulsion to search among the English foundries for the type
      faces which most pleased him.</p>


     <p>Franklin's stay in London, according to the <hi rend="italic">Autobiography</hi>, lasted
      about eighteenth months, from December 24, 1724, to July 23, 1726. Almost immediately upon
      arrival he secured employment at the large printing house of Samuel Palmer in Bartholomew
      Close, first as a pressman, and later as a compositor. After staying there about a year, he
      joined the even larger house of John Watts near Lincoln Inn Fields, where he continued working
      until his return to America. The associations with both great printing establishments, one may
      infer, left their considerable mark on Franklin and contributed much to a developing interest
      in type founding and design.</p>

     <p>Located near Palmer's in Bartholomew Close was the type foundry of Thomas James, at that
      time the most important firm of its kind in England. Franklin states that he "had seen type
      cast at James's in London" (<hi rend="italic">Memoris</hi>, p. 136) and observed the craft
      sufficiently to be able later while working for Keimer to contrive moulds, crude makeshift
      puncheons, and matrices suitable to supply Keimer's wanted sorts. At both Palmer's and Watts'
      Franklin would also have heard of William Caslon, whose new type faces were in time to make
      obsolete the James' large stock of earlier English and Dutch fonts. Palmer and Watts each had
      recognized Caslon's genius, and commended him on his early letter cutting, and encouraged him
      to consider type-founding as a career, Palmer repudiating his stand later when some of his
      business associates made clear to him that Caslon's success as a founder might ruin their
      trade.<ref target="f011.12.05" n="5"><hi rend="super">5</hi></ref> Hence, a dozen years
      before Franklin was to buy his first Caslon fonts, he must have had pointed out to him, or
      have seen for himself, the remarkable promise of this new letter designer.</p>


     <p>Franklin left London late in the summer of 1726 thinking that he was done with the craft of
      printing forever; he had accepted the offer of a clerkship in the Philadelphia store of Mr.
      Denham, a Quaker merchant, and entertained high prospects of eventually establishing a
      business of his own in the West Indies. The death of Denham in the spring of 1727 having
      dissipated Franklin's hopes, he returned reluctantly to the employ of the printer Samuel
      Keimer as the foreman of his shop. There he met Hugh Meredith, earned the esteem of Hugh's
      father, and having been offered financial backing by the elder Meredith <pb n="011.183"/>
      agreed to set up a printing house in partnership with the son in the spring of 1728. Franklin
      drew up a list of needed equipment amounting to &pound;200 in currency and gave it to Mr.
      Meredith, who in turn carried the order to a merchant (<hi rend="italic">Memoirs</hi>, pp.
      126, 132, 140, 164). This inventory for the new shop was sent probably with Captain Annis,
      clearing Philadelphia customs on October 19, 1727, and docking in London about the first week
      of December; the new partners' hope obviously was for delivery on an early sailing in the
      spring.</p>

     <p>Here then is Franklin's first order of type. He has left us no other record of the
      transaction or hints about the assortment of fonts requested &mdash; only the task of trying
      to reconstruct the inventory and find answers to a series of questions. An analysis of the
      type used in his early imprints makes clear that he had commissioned quantities of but six
      fonts. Three he planned to use regularly as text letter: the English, pica, and long primer;
      two others &mdash; the double pica and the French canon &mdash; for both limited text-letter
      and titling; one, the two line pica, exclusively for titling.<ref target="f011.12.06" n="6"
        ><hi rend="super">6</hi></ref> In addition he included the usual supply of quotations and a
      generous quantity of flowers to match the three sizes of his text type; these he used to
      contrive an ingenious array of factotums and page decorations, a marked feature of his
      typography throughout his printing career. Foreseeing the likelihood of printing almanacs
      years before he conceived the idea of writing and publishing his own <hi rend="italic">Poor
       Richards</hi>, he ordered an extra quantity of long primer figures and the necessary planet
      sorts.</p>


     <p>In what amounts and at what cost he purchased this type one can make only a close guess.
      Twenty-five years later, on October 27, 1753, Franklin wrote Strahan in London asking him to
      order from Caslon a quantity of type for "a small printing office . . . at New Haven," to be
      shipped by the first boat in the spring.<ref target="f011.12.07" n="7"><hi rend="super"
        >7</hi></ref> The itemized list except for the 100 lbs. of great primer and the 50 lbs. of
      two line English parallels so nearly the inventory of fonts found in Franklin's early printing
      that I offer it as a probable duplication of his first order.</p>


     <list>
      <item>300 lbs. long primer, with figures and signs sufficient for an almanac</item>

      <item>300 lbs. pica</item>

      <item>100 lbs. great primer</item>

      <item>300 lbs. English</item>

      <item>30 lbs. two line capitals and ffowers for different fonts</item>

      <item>20 lbs. quotations</item>

      <item>60 lbs. double pica</item>

      <item>50 lbs. two line English</item>

      <item>40 lbs. two line great primer<ref target="f011.12.08" n="8"><hi rend="super"
        >8</hi></ref></item>
     </list>


     <pb n="011.184"/>

     <p>Without the great primer and the two line English the order in aggregate weighs 1050 lbs.,
      about one-fourth the weight of the type owned by the firm of Franklin and Hall in 1766.<ref
       target="f011.12.09" n="9"><hi rend="super">9</hi></ref> This 1050 lbs. of type purchased in
      1728 would have cost Franklin and Meredith at least one-half of their available &pound;200 in
      currency (Wroth, <hi rend="italic">op. cit.</hi>, pp. 65-68).</p>


     <p>In this 1753 order one has no difficulty in identifying Caslon as the founder responsible
      for casting the fonts; with Franklin's initial order, on the other hand, one wonders whether
      or not he designated founder and face, particularly for the distinctive pica and English fonts
      which are identical except in size. Franklin's recent sojourn in London would have afforded
      him opportunity to decide upon the text letter he preferred, but his disillusioning experience
      with Governor Keith and his departure from London thinking that he was done with the printing
      craft forever might well have made such a hypothetical selection seem pointless. His pica and
      English fonts are slightly larger than those of his competitors Andrew Bradford and Samuel
      Keimer, and, I think, considerably more pleasing to the eye; this impression of greater
      attractiveness results in part, however, from Franklin's superior presswork and consistently
      cleaner case. On one occasion, at least (<hi rend="italic">Memoirs</hi>, p. 160), Franklin
      stated that the type which he used in <hi rend="italic">The Pennsylvania Gazette</hi> was
      "better" than that which Keimer had employed earlier in the same publication. Quite possibly
      Franklin made the claim because he had personally selected the fonts or relied on a knowing
      craftsman in London to select them for him and knew them to be superior to Keimer's; on the
      other hand, he may simply have been fortunate in the fonts which the Philadelphia merchant had
      secured for him. The fact that Franklin reordered quantities of the identical six fonts in
      1731 in order to stock the printing house of his partner Thomas Whitmarsh located in
      Charleston, South Carolina, suggests certainly that Franklin had a marked preference for the
      type he was then using in his own shop.</p>

     <p>In 1728 there were in England at most five foundries from which Franklin might have ordered
      his letter: in Oxford, the Andrews foundry, and in London, the foundries of Grover, Mitchell,
      James, and an anonymous founder for whom there exist no specific dates of operation.<ref
       target="f011.12.10" n="10"><hi rend="super">10</hi></ref> The only recorded extant specimen
      book for any of these is that one published together with the sale catalogue of the James <pb
       n="011.185"/> punches and matrices in 1782.<ref target="f011.12.11" n="11"><hi rend="super"
        >11</hi></ref> The specimen book includes only a sampling of the extensive holdings of the
      James foundry, particularly of the romans and italics, and the history of its compilation is a
      tangled one. "The greatest part" of it was done, however, in 1736,<ref target="f011.12.12"
       n="12"><hi rend="super">12</hi></ref> three years after Thomas James had bought up the
      matrices of the Andrew foundry and years before John James, his son and successor, had
      acquired a portion of the Mitchell foundry and the whole of those belonging to the Grover
      foundry, which had ceased operating with the death of its owner early in 1728.<ref
       target="f011.12.13" n="13"><hi rend="super">13</hi></ref> The fonts represented in the
      specimen book must therefore have been cast largely from matrices owned in 1728, the year in
      which Franklin ordered his letter, by either Andrews or James, and the greater portion of
      these, presumably, was owned originally by James. Of the type included in this specimen book
      one font is identical with Franklin's, the French canon no. 3, both roman and italic, labeled
      further as Berthelet 2, matrices 85, and Berthelet 3, matrices 69 respectively.<ref
       target="f011.12.14" n="14"><hi rend="super">14</hi></ref> Since Franklin was acquainted with
      the James foundry and since either Franklin or the Philadelphia merchant ordering the type
      would probably have found it more convenient to deal with a London rather than an Oxford
      foundry, this French canon titling type and the other five fonts listed in Franklin's 1728
      inventory were in all likelihood castings from matrices owned by the James foundry.</p>






     <p>These fonts acquired in 1728 at the outset of his career Franklin used steadily for the next
      ten years. He did, however, secure in the fall of 1734<ref target="f011.12.15" n="15"><hi
        rend="super">15</hi></ref> a small quantity of black letter long primer which he employed
      sporadically until 1742. For Franklin the new font served two special uses: one was to mark
      the holy days in the text of his <hi rend="italic">Poor Richards</hi>; the other was to set
      the <hi rend="italic">Gazette</hi> advertisements written in the German language, since
      Franklin never used in his own shop or in that of Franklin and Hall any German scriptorial
      letter. Black letter was by no means a novel type in Philadelphia printing. Andrew Bradford
      had small quantities of two black letter sizes &mdash; a two line English and a long primer
      &mdash; from the start of his career in 1713, and he and William Bradford, Jr., his nephew
      after him used the identical font of long primer for advertisements in German in their
      newspapers. Franklin's original font, readily distinguishable from that of the <pb n="011.186"
      /> Bradfords, bears a family resemblance to the type cut by Christoffel van Dijck and
      exhibited in the 1681 specimen of the elder Daniel Elzevir.<ref target="f011.12.16" n="16"
        ><hi rend="super">16</hi></ref> The Bradfords', on the other hand, resembles more closely
      the black letter English and pica of Oxford University cast from matrices presented by Dr.
      Fell.<ref target="f011.12.17" n="17"><hi rend="super">17</hi></ref> Fonts derived from both
      families of black letter appear among the samples in the James specimen of 1782, but only in
      sizes larger than the long primer.<ref target="f011.12.18" n="18"><hi rend="super"
       >18</hi></ref></p>





     <p>By 1738 Franklin's printing business had increased enormously. He launched his newspaper in
      October of 1729. As early as 1730 he had won from Bradford the position of official printer
      for the Pennsylvania General Assembly. In the late fall of 1732 he began publishing the first
      of his <hi rend="italic">Poor Richard Almanacks</hi>, which soon became so popular that he was
      eventually printing annual editions of nearly 10,000 copies. By 1734 he was serving as public
      printer for both New Jersey and Delaware, the second known before 1776 as the counties of
      New-castle, Kent, and Sussex. His election as Clerk of the Pennsylvania General Assembly in
      1736 put him in a position to obtain commissions for even more government printing than he had
      enjoyed before. This increased volume obliged him to consider some long range plans for
      acquiring additional fonts and for replacing his present text letter which after ten years had
      become somewhat rubbed.</p>

     <p>The earliest in a series of purchases of new fonts of text letter appear together in the <hi
       rend="italic">Gazette</hi> on May 4, 1738. The issue is a memorable one, for it marks
      Franklin's first use of Caslon type, and possibly the earliest use of Caslon in Colonial
      American printing. His first two new fonts were pica and small pica, the second remarkable for
      its acute shortage of p and u sorts which obliged Franklin's compositors to substitute
      inverted d's and n's consistently until February of 1739. From this point in Franklin's
      career, the spring of 1738, until the termination of his partnership with Hall on January 21,
      1766, Franklin, with one exception purchased Caslon text type exclusively for use in his
      Philadelphia house. The single exception, an obviously non-Caslon font of bourgeois with swash
      italic capital A's and N's and a gawky oversized roman capital W, makes only two appearances
      in Franklin's recorded printing: one, the slight <hi rend="italic">Catalogue of Choice and
       Valuable Books</hi> offered for sale in the spring of 1744, and, two, portions of the text of
      Nos. 922-926 of the <hi rend="italic">Gazette</hi>, running from August 14, to September 11,
      1746. How this font came into his hands and when

      Hall's printing that the font was among Franklin's letter when he turned over his shop to his
      partner in 1748.</p>

     <p>Franklin's first font of Caslon long primer came into use in the <hi rend="italic"
       >Gazette</hi> on May 3, 1739, the issue of the previous week, April 26, 1739, revealing his
      earliest display of Caslon flowers. By July 17, 1740, he had acquired his first Caslon
      brevier, and probably his first Caslon English, although it makes no appearance in the <hi
       rend="italic">Gazette</hi> until September 18, 1740. At this time, or within a year, Franklin
      added fonts of Caslon great primer and paragon, a smaller quantity of Caslon double pica, and
      an assortment of Caslon titling letter &mdash; two line long primer, two line pica, and French
      canon. His two line double pica and five line pica, acquired about the same time, are for some
      unexplainable reason non-Caslon. Apparently the final purchase in this series was a small
      quantity of Caslon black letter brevier used first in the <hi rend="italic">Gazette</hi> on
      September 2, 1742. Parker, in compiling his inventory of the type owned by the partners in
      1766, fixed the weight of all the black letter &mdash; both long primer and brevier &mdash;
      together with "figures, planets, space rules" at a mere 53 lbs. (J. C. Oswald, <hi
       rend="italic">loc. cit.</hi>).</p>

     <p>This extensive purchase of Caslon type over a four-year period, 1738-1742, was the last
      Franklin was to make for his own shop before turning it over to his partner, David Hall, in
      January of 1748. The documents covering these transactions with Caslon, like those for
      Franklin's dealings earlier with the James foundry, are missing. The reconstruction is based,
      therefore, entirely on the evidence of the appearance of the type in Franklin's signed
      printing, particularly in the dated weekly issues of the <hi rend="italic">Gazette</hi>, which
      for each new font from brevier to English furnished the basis for assigning the approximate
      time of purchase and earliest occurrence in Franklin's presswork.</p>

     <p>Without the records dealing with these type purchases it is impossible to determine how much
      Franklin paid for his new fonts, how exacting he was in designating a particular letter when
      Caslon offered for sale a choice of fonts within a given size, and whether or not Franklin
      dealt directly with the Caslon foundry. If one may form an opinion based on Franklin's later
      purchases, the likelihood is that Franklin dealt indirectly with the Caslon foundry and merely
      designated the size of type which he desired to buy. Certainly after 1743, the year in which
      Franklin initiated his correspondence with Strahan, it is clear that while Franklin dwelt in
      America he ordered his additional Caslon fonts through Strahan and relied on his judgment in
      selecting the most suitable letter.<ref target="f011.12.19" n="19"><hi rend="super"
       >19</hi></ref></p>


     <pb n="011.188"/>

     <p>Parker's itemized inventory of the type owned by Franklin and Hall in 1766 does make it
      possible, however, to state with some certainty in what quantity Franklin purchased several of
      these first Caslon fonts. Parker lists the following: <list>
       <item>436 lbs. Long Primer, well worn</item>

       <item>318 lbs. Small Pica, almost worn out</item>

       <item>421 lbs. Pica, Old, and much batter'd</item>

       <item>334 lbs. Old English, fit for little more than old metal</item>

       <item>223 lbs. Great Primer, well worn</item>

       <item>158 lbs. Double Pica, pretty good</item>

       <item> 91 lbs. Double English Do.<ref target="f011.12.20" n="20"><hi rend="super"
         >20</hi></ref></item>
      </list>
     </p>


     <p>All of these, which represent but a portion of Parker's total inventory, I have associated
      with Franklin's original purchase of Caslon type only because I have found no clear evidence
      either in the printed matter or in the extant manuscripts to indicate that Franklin bought
      later additional quantities of these fonts. The one exception is a later font of Caslon
      English, but Parker clearly distinguishes it from the older one: "502 lbs. Newer English,
      nearly half worn" (J. C. Oswald, <hi rend="italic">loc. cit.</hi>). This newer Caslon English,
      acquired in order that Hall might undertake a large piece of government printing in folio, had
      appeared first in the printing of the laws of the General Assembly for April 5, 1756, while
      the older Caslon English seems last to have been employed in the printing of the laws for
      February 3, 1756. Parker's noting the existence of the two English fonts in 1766 makes clear
      that though Hall had acquired a fresh font of English some ten years before, he had not seen
      fit to scrap his worn one.</p>

     <p>Thus it is possible to explain how Franklin and Hall kept possession of their original font
      of Caslon English for a period of twenty-six years. They used it for sixteen years, and once
      it had worn out, merely kept it in storage for the next ten. But what of the other original
      Caslon fonts which they retained for an equally long period and kept in use? Part of the
      explanation certainly is that Franklin and Hall were loath to lay out any more money on type
      than they needed to. They expected their business to yield a substantial income, and to
      achieve this objective in troubled times with an unstable economy was no simple task.
      Moreover, Hall was a frugal man who tended to make do with what materials he possessed so long
      as they were tolerable. But a more important part of the explanation is the kind of printing
      they were engaged in and the demands that that printing made on their various sizes of type.
      From 1728 to 1738 Franklin regularly used English, <pb n="011.189"/> pica, and long primer in
      his newspaper, long primer in the almanacs, and long primer and pica predominantly in the
      books he printed. Thereafter he began to use smaller and smaller fonts in the <hi
       rend="italic">Gazette</hi>. The English disappeared, then the pica, and finally much of the
      small pica. After 1739 he fixed upon long primer and brevier, then all brevier, and
      eventually, brevier and bourgeois, but neither Franklin nor Hall was happy over their purchase
      of the bourgeois and wished they had bought brevier instead. The almanacs continued to be set
      in long primer, but this printing involved long years of standing type which made
      comparatively small additional demands on their font of long primer. As early as 1729 Franklin
      had begun printing annually in folio the laws of the Province and the votes and proceedings of
      the General Assembly; the large collected editions of these laws of Pennsylvania and those of
      the neighboring provinces followed in the forties and fifties. The font which Franklin and
      Hall used for their text letter was English and the section headings they set in the larger
      great primer, double pica, and double English. For the more sporadic portion of their printing
      &mdash; the pamphlets and books published in small editions &mdash; Franklin and Hall used
      their small pica and pica, or English. Hence the fonts which they worked hardest and needed
      most often to replace were the brevier and the English. The other fonts, the long primer,
      small pica, pica, great primer, double pica, and double English, they used more sparingly, and
      therefore understandably it was these sizes of the original Caslon purchase that remained
      tolerably serviceable from the time of their acquisition in 1738-1742 to the termination of
      the partnership early in 1766.</p>

     <p>When Franklin turned over his shop on January 21, 1748, to his new partner, he put into
      Hall's hands a stock of all-Caslon text type from eight to ten years old. The purchasing of
      any additional fonts was to be Franklin's responsibility,<ref target="f011.12.21" n="21"><hi
        rend="super">21</hi></ref> though by stipulation in the articles of agreement the two men
      were to share jointly in the expense.<ref target="f011.12.22" n="22"><hi rend="super"
       >22</hi></ref> The font first in need of replacement was, quite predictably, the brevier,
      which with ten years of hard wear in the <hi rend="italic">Gazette</hi> had become markedly
      worn; it lingered in the standing type of a few advertisements until December 19, 1752, more
      than two years after the new Caslon brevier had been pressed into service on September 27,
       1750.<ref target="f011.12.23" n="23"><hi rend="super">23</hi></ref> Franklin placed <pb
       n="011.190"/> the order for this new type through Strahan just as he was to do with that for
      the new Caslon English mentioned earlier, which was commissioned in the summer and again in
      the fall of 1755 (HLB I, August 28, 1755) and first used in the spring of 1756 for printing
      one group of the laws.</p>




     <p>Also in the fall of 1755 both Franklin<ref target="f011.12.24" n="24"><hi rend="super"
        >24</hi></ref> and Hall were in correspondence with Strahan about a new small-body font.
      Hall wanted "500 weight" of a font, "Body of Brevier with long primer face &amp; if not with a
      Long primer Face, with one betwixt a long primer and Brevier" (HLB I, August 28, 1755). Caslon
      having cast the letter during the winter, Strahan in early March shipped "The Fount of Brevier
      . . . on Board Captain Reeve, who was ready to sail when an Embargo was clapt on all our
      Shipping for Six Weeks" (HLB I, March 13, 1756). The type arrived finally in time to be used
      in the <hi rend="italic">Gazette</hi> on June 24, 1756. Franklin writing to Strahan from New
      York on July 2, remarked that "the brevier fount . . . came to hand in good order and pleases
      Mr. Hall and me very much."<ref target="f011.12.25" n="25"><hi rend="super">25</hi></ref> In a
      reply to Hall written in September Strahan noted that "the new Letter in your Newspaper . . .
      looks very well" (HLB I, September 11, 1756). Then the storm broke. Hall discovered that he
      had received not a large face-small body font, but all bourgeois, and shortly thereafter
      Franklin discovered further that Caslon had billed him for a font of brevier at 2/6 per pound
      rather than for a font of bourgeois, which should have cost a half shilling less. Franklin
      felt put upon. He had paid &pound;58/17/6 for the font, had been overcharged &pound;11/15/6,
      and immediately wrote Strahan somewhat sharply requesting that he see Caslon about a refund,
      which we may infer was forthcoming since Franklin made no later reference to the matter.<ref
       target="f011.12.26" n="26"><hi rend="super">26</hi></ref> An analysis of the bill reveals,
      incidentally, that the precise weight of the letter was 471 lbs.</p>




     <p>When Hall next had occasion to ask his partner to buy some new letter, Franklin was residing
      in London, having arrived there in July of 1757. When Hall's request reached him in the spring
      of 1758, he went directly to the foundry to place the order. Caslon cast the font &mdash; 192
      lbs. of bourgeois &mdash; over the summer, and Franklin arranged for it to be shipped in
      September. The shipping was delayed, however, so that the type did not reach Philadelphia
      until the following spring.<ref target="f011.12.27" n="27"><hi rend="super">27</hi></ref></p>


     <p>What Hall wanted was not bourgeois but brevier. "The old Letter is shockingly bad," he wrote
      Franklin on March 5, 1760, "and I don't care to use the Bourgois [in the <hi rend="italic"
       >Gazette</hi> advertisement], for the Reason <pb n="011.191"/> I have several times given
      you, that it drives out so much . . . ."<ref target="f011.12.28" n="28"><hi rend="super"
        >28</hi></ref> Franklin, having apparently realized his mistake some weeks earlier, had
      ordered Caslon to cast 300 lbs. of brevier at once. The font reached Hall on June 5, 1760 (HLB
      II, July 2, 1760), and first appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Gazette</hi> on June 19. The
      precise composition of this font, the last which Franklin was to purchase for the firm of
      Franklin and Hall, he described to Hall in a letter dated March 28, 1760: "I order'd the Fount
      all Roman, as it will hold out better in the same Quantity of Work, having but half the Chance
      of Wanting Sorts, that the same Weight of Rom. &amp; Ital. would have, and the old Italic is
      not so much worn as the Roman, and so may serve a little longer."<ref target="f011.12.29"
       n="29"><hi rend="super">29</hi></ref> The best that Hall could reply was, "The Brevier . . .
      looks very well, but sticks when distributed most intolerably (HLB II, July 2, 1760); and six
      months later, "The Brevier seems pretty perfect, only the lower Case s's run short . . . ."
      (HLB II, February 9, 1761). Thus the problem of insufficient sorts continued to plague
      Franklin. It had caused him to try his hand at casting type while he still worked for Keimer;
      it reduced him to an unhappy expedient in working with his new Caslon small pica in 1738; it
      caused Hall through the years to write Strahan repeatedly for small quantities of individual
      letters,<ref target="f011.12.30" n="30"><hi rend="super">30</hi></ref> and Franklin was yet
      to face in the closing years and even final months of his life the wrangling correspondence
      with Francis Childs over the short sorts in the old Passy fonts.<ref target="f011.12.31"
       n="31"><hi rend="super">31</hi></ref></p>





     <p>By July of 1761, a little more than a year after Franklin had sent over the last font of
      Caslon brevier, Hall was urging him to order a like quantity of the same letter to be shipped
      at once. The <hi rend="italic">Gazette</hi> advertisements were becoming so bulky that he was
      obliged "to distribute the standing ones in order to set up the new" (HLB II, July 20, 1761).
      Franklin allowed the request to go unheeded so involved had he become by this time in the
      responsibilities of his work as provincial agent. Eventually Hall understood that Franklin
      could no longer be expected to perform even these occasional chores for the firm, and on
      November 21, 1764, Hall asked Strahan to secure for him 500 lbs. of Caslon brevier, despite
      the fact that at that moment Franklin was again on the high seas bound for London, after
      returning to America <pb n="011.192"/> in the fall of 1762. Hall explained further: "Mr.
      Franklin used to send for the Printing Letter, but as his Time and mine will, in all
      probability be out before I have the Pleasure of seeing him again what comes now will be in my
      Name . . . ." (HLB II, November 21, 1764).</p>

     <p>When the partnership terminated in January of 1766, Hall took over the shop and shortly
      thereafter joined in a new business agreement with a former employee, William Sellers. Their
      type save for the newly acquired font of brevier consisted of the stock previously owned by
      Franklin and Hall. In quantity and variation of size the letter was extensive, but as Parker
      explained to Franklin, ". . . indeed the whole is worn much, except the Double Pica and newest
      English, tho' neither of them are new."<ref target="f011.12.32" n="32"><hi rend="super"
        >32</hi></ref> Within six months Hall had begun ordering replacements for the old fonts,
      starting with the long primer and titling type (HLB III, June 7, 1766). Only one of Franklin's
      1728 type acquisitions, the James' French canon, remained in use throughout the 38 years of
      Franklin's association with the Philadelphia printing house, and passed into the possession of
      Hall and Sellers. I found it used only once, and this in a line of long standing type. Within
      the year it had disappeared.</p>


     <p>This then is the history of the fonts of type which Franklin employed in his Philadelphia
      shop from 1728 to 1766, and the necessary preliminary to the consideration of one final
      question: With what certainty is it now possible to identify as Franklin's a piece of
      printing, unsigned or issued as the work of another, which falls within the 38 years of his
      active printing career and which is by some fashion connected with Pennsylvania, New Jersey,
      or Delaware? The answer is best divided into two parts. During the greater portion of
      Franklin's career as the master of his own shop, from the spring of 1728 to the late summer of
      1743, I believe it possible to identify positively on the evidence of the type just about any
      piece of unsigned Franklin printing. In 1728 Franklin had but two competitors in Philadelphia.
      The less significant was his old employer, Samuel Keimer, whose meager holdings of text type
      consisted of two fonts of English and one each of pica and long primer, all of them readily
      distinguishable from Franklin's. Keimer sold his shop to David Harry in 1729 and went to
      Barbados where Harry joined him in 1730, "taking the printing house with him" (<hi
       rend="italic">Memoirs</hi>, p. 174). Franklin's more formidable competitor was, of course,
      Andrew Bradford, whose type holdings exceeded Franklin's but differed from them in every font.
      One, therefore, can distinguish <pb n="011.193"/> Franklin's printing from that of Andrew
      Bradford during the years 1728-1742, and from that of Cornelia Bradford, his widow, who
      directed the business actively until 1746. Christopher Sauer set up his press in Germantown in
      1738, but his type also differed from Franklin's as did the fonts of both Peter Zenger and
      William Bradford, Sr. in New York. There were no printers in New Jersey or Delaware.</p>

     <p>The second part of the answer involves complications. It covers the period of 1743 to 1766,
      the last few years of Franklin's sole proprietorship and the whole of his partnership with
      Hall. In 1742 Franklin completed his series of purchases of all-Caslon fonts; by 1743 he had
      disposed of the last of his original James letter except for the seldom seen French canon,
      which persisted until 1766. It is this array of new Caslon letter acquired by Franklin that at
      one and the same time presents the surest basis for identifying his later unsigned presswork,
      and the gravest obstacle. The chief complicating factor is Andrew Bradford's nephew, William
      Bradford, Jr., who opened his Philadelphia shop about July 1, 1742, and had acquired by early
      September 1743, a font of Caslon English, by December 1745, a font of Caslon pica, and by
      December 1746, a font of Caslon long primer. He did possess from the outset, however,
      non-Caslon fonts of English and long primer, and an assortment of non-Caslon titling letter.
      Further, he used printer's ornaments only rarely, none of them cast by Caslon. Had he
      continued systemically to purchase additional Caslon type, the problem of differentiating his
      printing from Franklin's on the basis of the letter alone would have proved all but
      insolvable. Fortunately for this study he did not. His two later fonts of bourgeois are
      non-Caslon, and he seems never to have owned a font of brevier.</p>

     <p>Further, when William's uncle, Andrew Bradford died, he stipulated in his will that the
      nephew was to receive at the death of Cornelia Bradford &mdash; she died in 1755 &mdash; all
      of his "Printing Press Letter . . . if he shall behave himself handsomely towards her."<ref
       target="f011.12.33" n="33"><hi rend="super">33</hi></ref> According to Isaiah Thomas,
      Cornelia had been responsible for disrupting an earlier partnership between Andrew and his
       nephew;<ref target="f011.12.34" n="34"><hi rend="super">34</hi></ref> therefore William's
      chances of acquiring his uncle's fonts before 1755, if at all, would seem remote. But the
      letter in William's publications tells another story. By 1746 William was using Andrew's
      newest font of English, and by 1752 he appears to have gained possession of much of the
      remainder of Andrew's stock of type. Since Franklin and later Hall used only Caslon fonts and
      William Bradford, Jr., both Caslon and non-Caslon type, <pb n="011.194"/> particularly the
      second after falling heir to his late uncle's letter, it is possible with close study to
      distinguish most later unsigned Franklin printing from that of Bradford. The identification of
      unsigned Bradford printing set in Caslon English and long primer is made the easier after 1748
      by the fouling of these cases with non-Caslon sorts.</p>



     <p>Other than Franklin and the Bradfords, who were printing almost entirely in the English
      language, and Christopher Sauer, who was printing more in German than in English, Philadelphia
      in the 1740's had only a trio of struggling minor German printers &mdash; Joseph Crell and two
      Franklin partners, Gotthard Armbruster and Johan Boehm &mdash; all employing non-Caslon fonts
      or German scriptorial letter. In the large cities to the north, however, the important
      printers were all equipping their houses with Caslon. In New York City Franklin established a
      silent partnership with James Parker, the successor to the retiring William Bradford, Sr., and
      fitted the new shop with a complete stock of Caslon type by 1743. In Boston by the mid-forties
      Rogers and Fowle, Kneeland and Green, Gookin, and Henchman had all acquired Caslon fonts.</p>

     <p>In the 1750's two of the three new printers in English to set up shop in Philadelphia were
      men trained by Franklin, James Chattin and William Dunlap, the latter a Franklin partner in
      Lancaster before moving to Philadelphia. The third newcomer was Andrew Steuart. Chattin,
      active from 1752 to 1758, first in Lancaster and later in Philadelphia, possessed in addition
      to his Caslon English, long primer, and brevier, an assortment of distinctive non-Caslon
      fonts, which makes it relatively simple to distinguish much of his printing from Franklin and
      Hall's. Dunlap and Steuart, on the other hand, both starting their careers in 1758, reveal
      almost from the outset all-Caslon letter. Further-more, by 1754 James Parker had set up a
      printing house in Wood-bridge, New Jersey, employing Caslon type entirely, and by 1761, James
      Adams, a Franklin-trained printer, had begun using Caslon in his new shop located in
      Wilmington, Delaware.</p>

     <p>The two new Philadelphia printers in the early sixties were Peter Miller and Henry Miller,
      craftsmen whose houses were stocked with both German scriptorial and English roman and italic
      letter. The chief difference between the two is that Henry Miller, a former Franklin
      journeyman, employed for his publications in English all-Caslon text and titling type while
      Peter used largely non-Caslon fonts.</p>

     <p>This increasingly widespread use of Caslon by the printers both in Philadelphia and in the
      neighboring provinces makes it most difficult after 1753 to identify by means of the letter
      alone an unsigned Franklin <pb n="011.195"/> and Hall publication, and between 1758 and 1766,
      well nigh impossible.</p>

     <p>There remains finally the need to discuss the pattern of the accompanying series of plates
      and of the digest of known fact concerning each font exhibited, for these plates and their
      related commentary constitute the basic evidence by which future bibliographers may test the
      validity of the conclusions presented in the earlier sections of this paper and carry on
      independent research in eighteenth-century American printing among the Middle Colonies.</p>

     <p>There are in all twenty-four plates, seven showing a variety of fonts widely used by
      Franklin's competitors during the years when Franklin was sole master of his establishment,
      fifteen reproducing the text fonts used by Franklin or by Franklin and Hall, and two offering
      selected samples of the Franklin titling type plus his very limited holdings of English
      scriptorial and pica Greek letter.</p>

     <p>In each plate exhibiting a text font it was my intention to achieve two objectives: (1) to
      reproduce at actual size a twenty-one line segment of the font with representative samplings
      of both the roman and italic letter, and (2) to present considerably enlarged a key selection
      of characters designed to assist the scholar in identifying a particular type. The first
      objective has not been fully realized in every plate, but since the fonts owned by Franklin
      and his Philadelphia competitors often differ markedly, the samples pictured should offer the
      scholar a reasonably workable basis for positive identification.</p>

     <p>Several obstacles stood in the way of achieving the first objective. The limited size of the
      plate prohibited the inclusion of a twenty-one line segment of the larger fonts, the double
      pica and paragon. Also it was not always possible to find among extant copies of Franklin's
      imprints set in smaller fonts twenty-one line segments combining representative settings of
      both the roman and italic letter, or where such examples were found, uneven impression in the
      original printing or defects such as extreme warping, faded inking, and tears, stains, or
      distorting repairs made satisfactory photographic reproduction unfeasible. Among the black
      letter fonts, it was difficult or on occasion impossible to find extended passages from which
      to choose a suitable example. With each segment of type in mass, regardless of size, I have
      appended a millimeter rule so that the scholar may test for himself the degree of accuracy
      with which the letter has been reproduced at life size and make compensations where the
      enlargement varies a millimeter or two.</p>

     <pb n="011.196"/>

     <p>The second objective, that of reproducing much enlarged and truly characteristic a series of
      letters useful in identifying a specific font, was likewise a task beset with difficulties.
      Any enlargements as great as those offered on the plates will of necessity involve a certain
      amount of distortion, the smaller the characters as those reproduced from the fonts of brevier
      and bourgeois, the greater the distortion.</p>

     <p>Furthermore, those letters recurring frequently in a font designed for setting copy written
      in English may be cast from a series of matrices, rather than from a single one, and therefore
      may differ slightly in tilt depending on how the puncheon was held when the matrix was struck;
      hence, despite my careful scanning of many occurrences of the same letter before selecting
      what was considered a truly characteristic example, it is possible that I may have reproduced
      only one typical casting where several are present in a given font. Another complication in
      selection arose from the fact that it was not possible consistently to present reproductions
      of letters in settings which exhibited the font fresh from the foundry. And even where this
      was possible, the user of the plates must be wary of what changes in appearance may occur in
      individual characters after years of use when the sharpness of line is blunted, the terminals
      distorted, and tails, ears, finials, and beaks damaged.</p>

     <p>Two other points need brief words of explanation. First, key letters have been presented
      greatly enlarged in order that one may perceive more easily the distinctive design of the
      characters: the curvature of bowls, contour of arms, and variation in terminals. The letters
      in enlargement are not to be considered an accurate basis for judging the relative size of one
      character to another. Use rather the sampling of the font in mass as the basis for making that
      judgment. Second, the characters enlarged include many more capitals than lower case letters.
      The reasons for such a selection are that: (1) in the Franklin period it was compositorial
      practice to capitalize all important nouns; hence capitals abound in the texts under
      consideration; (2) many of the capitals exhibit distinctive variations, especially in arms,
      stems, beaks, finials, and spurs; and (3) these characteristics may be the more readily
      discerned in the larger capitals than in the lower-case letters.</p>

     <p>In the enlarged reproduction of characters in the black letter fonts, of which Franklin and
      the Bradfords had clearly limited supplies and which they employed most frequently in setting
      advertisements in their newspapers, hastily printed on inferior grades of native paper, I had
      the greatest difficulty in discovering wholly satisfactory examples; since, however, almost
      every character in Franklin's long primer font differs <pb n="011.197"/> from that in the
      Bradfords, I have chosen to offer the characters as I found them and have refrained from
      retouching them in order to suggest their original full design.</p>
    </div2>

     <head/>
     <p>The commentary accompanying each plate includes approximately the same kind of information.
      The first entry gives the name of the printer or printers using the font; the
      eighteenth-century name for the font; its twenty-line measurement in millimeters except for
      that of the titling type where the height of the capital is given; and the terminal dates of
      use of a particular font by one or more printers.</p>

     <p>The second entry, "Key Letters," offered for all but the Caslon fonts, includes descriptions
      of individual characters useful in identifying the font quickly. The aim usually has been to
      designate characters which make it possible for the scholar at a glance to distinguish the
      Franklin letter from the same letter in fonts used by his contemporaries.</p>

     <p>The third entry, "Comment," includes information concerning the years during which the font
      was regularly in use and in some instances the transference of a font from one printing house
      to another. This entry often includes also in a second paragraph the names of printers other
      than Franklin using a like font during the same years.</p>

     <p>The final entry, "Occurrences," lists a sampling of imprints wherein the particular font has
      been used. A number preceded by "C" refers to the entry of the work in W. J. Campbell's <hi
       rend="italic">A Short-Title Checklist of all known Franklin Imprints</hi>; a number preceded

       &mdash; Franklin's Pica No. 1 &mdash; also markedly worn occurs in an unsigned 1757 broadside
       announcing a Rhode Island lottery. I have not yet made an extensive examination of the
       Franklin Newport imprints, but the occurrence of these worn fonts in Rhode Island printing
       suggests the possibility that some years after B. Franklin had purchased his new Caslon
       English and pica he may have sent his earlier non-Caslon fonts to Newport where in 1738 his
       brother's widow took over the shop until her son James could be educated and trained to the
       printing business in Philadelphia by his uncle.</item>

    <div2  id="vol011.13.01" type="section" n="1">
     <head/>
     <p>THERE IS ALMOST A 'STAR-CROSS'D' QUALITY IN both the life and literary career of Nathanael
      West. When he was graduated from Brown University in 1924, the college annual said, 'He seems
      a bit eccentric at times, a characteristic of all geniuses.' His first novel, <hi
       rend="italic">The Dream Life of Balso Snell</hi>, dispensed entirely with plausibility, and
      his other three could certainly be labeled 'grotesque.' If <hi rend="italic">Balso Snell</hi>
      was ignored and <hi rend="italic">A Cool Million</hi> called a disappointment, <hi
       rend="italic">Miss Lonelyhearts</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Day of the Locust</hi> were
      highly regarded by his friends, especially Edmund Wilson. Yet <hi rend="italic">A Cool
       Million</hi> was remaindered; <hi rend="italic">Miss Lonelyhearts</hi> came out just as
      Live-right was going bankrupt; and when <hi rend="italic">The Day of the Locust</hi> had sold
      but 1,480 copies, West wrote F. Scott Fitzgerald, 'So far the box score stands: Good
      reviews&mdash;fifteen per cent, bad reviews&mdash;twenty-five percent, brutal personal
      attacks&mdash;sixty per cent.' Although he went to Hollywood after 20th Century-United Artists
      bought <hi rend="italic">Miss Lonely-hearts</hi>, he never worked on the script and it came
      out under another title; and except for RKO's 'I Stole a Million,' his talents were wasted by
      the movies on Westerns and B-pictures. Nine months after he married his Irish beauty they were
      both killed in an auto collision in California. <hi rend="italic">The New York Times</hi>
      account of the accident featured his wife, the Eileen of 'My Sister Eileen,' put her in the
      headline, misspelled his name, got two of the titles of his novels wrong, erred on his age and
      in other particulars. Even his sister-in-law, Ruth McKenney, got his age wrong in her book,
       <hi rend="italic">Love Story</hi>, as do Stanley J. Kunitz and Howard Haycraft's <hi
       rend="italic">Twentieth Century Authors</hi> (also the day of his death), Malcolm Cowley's
       <hi rend="italic">Exile's Return</hi>, and most other accounts.</p>

     <p>Those who have written on West cite his four novels, but there is no bibliography of his
      work and of writings about him. He is ignored by Alfred Kazin's <hi rend="italic">On Native
       Grounds</hi> (New York, 1942), by W. M. Frohock's <hi rend="italic">The Novel of Violence,
       1920-1950</hi> (Dallas, 1950), by Blanche Housman Gelfant's <hi rend="italic">The American
       City Novel</hi> (Norman, <pb n="011.208"/> 1954), and by Fred B. Millet's <hi rend="italic"
       >Contemporary American Authors</hi> (New York, 1940), which treats 219 writers. The
      three-volume <hi rend="italic">Literary History of the United States</hi> (New York, 1948),
      edited by Robert Spiller and others, gives him but two sentences; Lewis Leary's <hi
       rend="italic">Articles on American Literature, 1900-1950</hi> (Durham, 1954) lists only one
      article about him, and the Hoffman-Allen-Ulrich <hi rend="italic">The Little Magazine</hi>
      (Princeton, 1946) gives his name in one place and spells it wrong. James Hart's <hi
       rend="italic">Oxford Companion to American Literature</hi> omitted him from the first edition
      (New York, 1941) and the second edition (1948), but in the third edition (1956) he is given a
      brief paragraph.</p>

     <p>In addition to his being treated in the <hi rend="italic">Oxford Companion</hi>, there are
      other indications that Nathanael West may be given the attention many think he deserves. A
      Ph.D. dissertation and at least two M.A. theses have been written on his work; <hi
       rend="italic">Miss Lonelyhearts</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Day of the Locust</hi> have
      both been reprinted by New Directions in their 'New Classics' series; these two and <hi
       rend="italic">A Cool Million</hi> were recently published in London; <hi rend="italic">Miss
       Lonelyhearts</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Day of the Locust</hi> have been reissued in
      paperbacks; <hi rend="italic">Miss Lonelyhearts</hi> was translated into French; and finally,
      critical essays&mdash;such as those by Robert M. Coates, Malcolm Cowley, Richard B. Gehman,
      Alan Ross, and Edmund Wilson&mdash;continue to appear from time to time. An ironical footnote
      to West criticism is that the longest essay yet printed, in the <hi rend="italic">Western
       Review</hi>, which the editors called 'definitive,' resulted in a charge of plagiarism.<ref
       target="f011.13.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref></p>


     <p>Asked to choose the 'most undeservedly neglected book' of the past twenty-five years, Leslie
      A. Fiedler wrote in the Autumn 1956 <hi rend="italic">American Scholar</hi> that he considered
       <hi rend="italic">A Cool Million</hi> but decided against it because West had 'after all,
      achieved [a] reputation, though not for the works I prefer.' While this reputation is not yet
      fixed, it is surely true that West at the moment is neither brutally attacked by critics nor
      completely ignored.</p>

     <p>Finally, in May 1957 Farrar, Straus and Cudahy issued <hi rend="italic">The Complete Works
       of Nathanael West</hi>, containing the four novels and an introduction by Alan Ross (from <hi
       rend="italic">Horizon</hi>). <hi rend="italic">The Saturday Review</hi> put his portrait on
      its cover, every review I have seen has been laudatory, and <hi rend="italic">The New
       Yorker</hi> said the book 'contains some of the best writing <pb n="011.209"/> that has been
      produced by an American in this century.' To paraphrase Richard B. Gehman: 'Seventeen years
      after his death: that is the final ironic, tragic, Westian joke.'</p>

       <p>Published August 1931 in an edition of 500 copies. The original price was &dollar;3.00 and
        (boards) &dollar;10.00.</p>
       <p>First edition.</p>
       <p>Copies were sold by Moss &amp; Kamin, Inc., then of 1423 Sixth Avenue, New York City. I
        have not seen a copy in boards. The book has for some time been a collector's item, copies
        in good condition bringing &dollar;25.00, although they do not turn up very often in
        catalogues. An advertisement for the book in <hi rend="italic">Contact</hi>, I (May 1932),
        4, reads: 'A strange anti-literary novel best characterized by Kurt Schwitter's definition
        "Tout ceque l'artiste crache, c'est l'art!"' And in <hi rend="italic">Contact</hi>, I
        (October 1932), 3: 'If you desire two parallel lines to meet at once, or even in the near
        future, it is important to make all arrangements beforehand, preferably by wireless.' The
        book has never been reprinted.</p>

       passes his time in drawing exotic pictures, quoting strange and fancial poetry, and

     <lb/><hi rend="italic">by</hi><lb/>
     <name type="author">Curt F. B&uuml;hler</name>
    </head>

    <p>A small body of literature has grown up about that anonymous, witty poem entitled <hi
      rend="italic">La Compagnia del Mantellaccio</hi>, formerly (and incorrectly) ascribed to
     Lorenzo de' Medici. Under no. 7260, the <hi rend="italic">Gesamtkatalog der Wiegendrucke</hi>
     describes the only fifteenth-century edition of this work recorded by the Kommission:
     [Florence: Francesco di Dino], 13 April 1489. A facsimile of this printing, together with a
     listing and discussion of the then-known editions of this poem (thirteen in all, printed
     between 1489 and 1817) had previously been issued by R. Salari (Florence: Antonio Cecchi,
     1861). Lastly, an article by the Marchese Roberto Ridolfi ("La 'Compagnia del Mantellaccio'e la
     sua sconosciuta edizione originale," <hi rend="italic">La Bibliofilia</hi>, XLII (1940),
     282-288) described the earliest existing edition from the unique copy in the author's library
     [Florence: Bartolommeo di Libri, 1482/3]; in a postscript, Ridolfi noted still another
     fifteenth-century printing, of which the only known copy then belonged to Dr. Giuseppe Martini.
     Ridolfi expressed the belief that this was the second edition of this "bizzarra composizione
     quattrocentesca," an opinion which the present article seeks to confirm.</p>

    <p>The Martini copy of this edition of the fifteenth-century poem is now in the Pierpont Morgan
     Library and may be described as follows: <q>Compagnia del Mantellaccio, [Florence: Bartolommeo
      di Libri, 1488].</q>
     <q>4&deg;. 4 leaves. [a<hi rend="super">4</hi>]. Type-page (33 lines): 160 x 73 mm. Type
       1:97<hi rend="super">1</hi>.</q>
     <q>folio 1: (d<hi rend="super">2</hi>) Inuouo cise facto una criocca &verbar;&verbar; socto
      humilta creata &amp; in feruore &verbar;&verbar; . . . (f. 4<hi rend="super">v</hi>, line 30):
      dir togli togli hor lieuati diquince &verbar;&verbar; Tanto glifece adosso strecta chaccia
      &verbar;&verbar; Finita lacompagnia del mantellaccio &verbar;&verbar;</q></p>

    <p>The only recorded copy is in the Pierpont Morgan Library (<hi rend="italic">Check List</hi>
     no. 1133A). It measures 199 x 132 mm. and is bound in brown morocco as item 3 in a "Sammelband"
     containing: (1) Luigi Pulci. <hi rend="italic">La Confessione</hi>. [Florence: Tubini and
     Ghirlandi, 1510]; (2) Luigi Pulci. <hi rend="italic">Frottole due</hi>. [Florence: Societas
     Colubris, 1499]; and (4) <hi rend="italic">Epistola consolatoria dei Caldi, Freddi, e
      Tiepidi</hi>. [Florence: Lorenzo Morgiani, 1496]. The volume was formerly in the collections
     of William Roscoe, Richard Heber, Sir George Holford, and Giuseppe Martini. Obtained by the
     Morgan Library in February, 1948.</p>

    <pb n="011.226"/>

    <p>Due to the happy circumstance that Ridolfi, in addition to supplying certain specific
     readings, reproduced the first and last pages of his volume and that the 1489 text is available
     through the facsimile, it becomes easily possible to establish the position of the Morgan
     incunabulum in relation to the other two editions. Since the Morgan <hi rend="italic">Compagnia
      del Mantellaccio</hi> contains only the shorter text (262 lines), without the additions ("la
     giunta facta di nuouo") found in the 1489 printing which extend the poem to 475 lines, it
     certainly belongs to the earlier redaction. The Morgan edition shares certain variant readings
     with the Ridolfi text: <list>
      <item>line 32: &amp; se il suo uista bene &amp; uoi il togliete (Morgan and Ridolfi) et se il
       suo uista bene uoi il togliete (1489 edition)</item>

      <item>line 97: Poi si riuolse da sinixtra mano (Morgan and Ridolfi) Poi si riuolse da sinixtra
       mano (1489)</item>

      <item>line 236: &amp; da sei mesi inqua non cene stata (Morgan and Ridolfi) [The 1489 text has
       "stato", though "stata" is required by the rhyme. This text also has incorrectly
       "mese".]</item>
     </list>
    </p>
    <p>In other instances the Morgan <hi rend="italic">Compagnia del Mantellaccio</hi> sides with
     the text of the 1489 edition: <list>
      <item>line 31: Ma fate uenire ad uoi el Solosmeo (Ridolfi) Ma fate ad uoi uenire el Solosmeo
       (Morgan and 1489)</item>


      <item>line 240: che di nouizii ha seco una funata (Ridolfi) che di nouizi ha seco una
       chiassata (Morgan and 1489)</item>

      <item>line 249: &amp; sta poi audir gli statuti nostri (Ridolfi) &amp; sta audir poi gli
       statuti nostri (Morgan and 1489)</item>

      <item>line 259: Pero non saccetti in queste prouince (Ridolfi) Pero nol mecterei in queste
       prouince (Morgan and 1489)</item>
     </list>
    </p>
    <p>Two lines deserve our special attention. In line 159, we find in the first edition a very
     curious bit of Latin, which Ridolfi reprints as: dilacuis renuis corpus sine more. For this
     mysterious text, Ridolfi offers a clever solution, namely that only by misreading a manuscript
     source could the compositor have arrived at this faulty passage. The Morgan and 1489 editions
     sensibly provide: dilaceremus corpus sine more. It is easy to see how the compositor could have
     misread the manuscript ending "-remus" as "renuis" by misinterpreting the minims; the
     "dilacuis" may be accounted for on the basis of dittography or dittology.</p>

    <p>In the next line (line 160, not 159 as Ridolfi states), the Morgan text has: Et lorenzo
     chalchagni il gran martire. While the Ridolfi text also provides the name of Lorenzo Calcagni,
     the 1489 edition substitutes that of Giulian Grassina, perhaps because Calcagni had died in the
     meantime. Both the gentlemen are shadowy figures. Who Grassina may have been, I have been
     unable to determine, unless he be identical (which seems doubtful) with the "Grassi (Jules),
     prof. de philos. et m&eacute;dec. 1498" listed by <pb n="011.227"/> Chevalier (col. 1850); the
     former certainly seems to be the "Calcagni (Laurent), de Brescia, jurisc., 1478" noted by the
     same authority (col. 750). He is described by J&ouml;cher (<hi rend="italic"
      >Gelehrten-Lexicon</hi>, 1750-51, I, 1557) as "ein Edelmann und Eques auratus von Brescia, im
     15 Seculo, war der Rechten Doctor, dabey ein Philosophus und Historicus." Possibly this
     Calcagni may be further identified as the author of the <hi rend="italic">Frottola del
      Villan</hi> "per el Venerabile homo ditto Calcagno", which begins "O maluasio rio vil&amacr;".
     This was described as an incunabulum by Copinger (no. 1405) but is now assigned to an otherwise
     unidentified, early sixteenth-century, Italian press in Proctor's <hi rend="italic">Index</hi>
     (no. 14063).</p>

    <p>From the above discussion it becomes evident that the Morgan copy, since it agrees in part
     with the version as found in the Ridolfi volume and partly with the 1489 edition, was certainly
     printed after the former and before the latter. The type is a good deal more worn than in the
     first printing and does not contain the gothic capital C, present in the earlier incunable. It
     is not unlikely that the later di Libri printing, since it contains a great many of the
     readings subsequently appearing in the di Dino edition, served as the "copy" for this edition
     after suitable additions had been made; it may, therefore, be dated as not later than the early
     months of 1489, and probably in 1488. Under these circumstances, the Morgan incunabulum is
     unquestionably the second surviving edition of the <hi rend="italic">Compagnia del
      Mantellacio</hi>.</p>

     <p>There is in the British Museum a smaller collection of poems which Niccol&ograve; Antonio
      Carmignano published under his own name in 1516: <hi rend="italic">Le Cose vulgare de Missere
       Colantonio Carmignano. . . nouamente impresse</hi>, completed by Georgio di Rusconi at Venice
      on 23 December 1516. Since the majority of these poems are to be found in the <hi
       rend="italic">Operette</hi> of 'Il Suavio Parthenopeo' printed at Bari in 1535, it is, after
      all, the author himself who discloses his identity and explains his pseudonym. The only
      portion of the 1535 book which is not to be found in the earlier Venice edition is the <pb
       n="011.228"/> central part addressed to Donna Isabella de Aragonia, Duchess of Milan and
      Bari, which deals with Queen Bona Sforza and her departure for Poland. More sonnets and
      eclogues were added, and these one presumes were not written until after 1516. One of the
      characters in the third and fourth of the four eclogues is called Suavio in both editions:
      thus by 1516 Carmignano had already thought of the name which he was to use as his pseudonym
      nearly twenty years later. The two books end with an epistle, ten sonnets, and a poem on the
      Crucifixion, but the Bari edition adds two or three pages of new poems to the Virgin Mary. On
      the whole, however, it is in the first half an almost page-for-page reprint of the Venice
      edition.</p>

     <p>This discovery was in fact made forty years ago in an exhaustive article by Giovanni Rosalba
      in a periodical which for no good reason is not available in the British Isles.<ref

      in a recent Paris sale-catalogue, a new possibility concerning the place of origin of
      Gillibert Nehou may now be surmised. Here it is stated that "l'imprimeur, Gilbert Nehou, ou de

      a way as to disturb the regular methods of proof-correction.<ref target="f011.16.03" n="3"
        ><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref> These facts give particular interest to the discovery of a
      proof-sheet for a book printed by Okes and dated 1609, for this provides an example of what
      may be called the normal printer's corrections during the printing of a sheet in this
      printing-house.</p>




     <p>The proof-sheet is found in the Folger Shakespeare Library copy of John Tichborne's <hi
       rend="italic">A Triple Antidote, against certaine very common Scandals of this time,</hi> . .
      . . (1609). That the manuscript corrections in this copy are indeed proof-corrections is
      proved by the facts that they occur on the outer forme of signature I and nowhere else in the
      book, and that they are mostly corrected in another copy of the same book which is in the
      Boston Public Library.<ref target="f011.16.04" n="4"><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref> The concern
      of the corrector with broken or badly inked type makes it almost certain that he was one of
      Okes' workmen and not the author of the book.</p>


     <p>The manuscript corrections in the Folger copy are as follows: <list>
       <item>1. Sig. I1. many [broken 'a'] &mdash;corrected in the margin to 'many'.</item>

       <item>2. Sig. I1. human &mdash;corrected in the margin to 'humane'.</item>

       <item>3. Sig. I1. power, &mdash;followed by a vertical mark, possibly erasing a stop or
        raised space.</item>

       <item>4. Sig. I1. power established &mdash;corrected in the margin to 'power,
        established'.</item>

       <item>5. Sig. I1. through &mdash;the defective 'r' underlined and a cross added in the
        margin.</item>

       <item>6. Sig. I2<hi rend="super">v</hi>. fame &mdash;corrected in the margin to
        'fame,'.</item>

       <item>7. Sig. I3. whereof &mdash;the defective 'f' underlined and a cross added in the
        margin.</item>

       <item>8. Sig. I3. God &mdash;followed by a short vertical mark.</item>

       <item>9. Sig. I3. fall [broken 'f'] &mdash;corrected in the margin to 'fall'.</item>

       <item>10. Sig. I4<hi rend="super">v</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Bucer</hi> &mdash;corrected in
        the margin to '<hi rend="italic">Bucer</hi>,'.</item>
      </list> Cropping has probably lost the full correction of 'God' on I3.</p>

     <p>The Boston copy shows that these corrections were carried out as follows: <list>
       <item>1. The defective 'a' was probably replaced, but with a partly defective type.</item>

       <pb n="011.230"/>

       <item>2. and 3. The 'e' was added to 'human'; a space was mis-adjusted after 'power,' leaving
        a larger mark than any that could have been covered by the proof-corrector's ink mark; and,
        to justify the line, a space between two words was reduced and 'State' altered to 'ftate'
        ['ft' ligatured].</item>

       <item>4. The comma was added wrongly, giving 'powere, stablished', and in doing so a space
        was raised at one end of the line and 'as' misplaced above the line of type at the other
        end.</item>

       <item>5. Apparently no change was made.</item>

       <item>6. The comma was added, but the type disturbed to print 'fame' [with defective
        'a'].</item>

       <item>7. The defective 'f' was replaced by another, but still imperfect, type.</item>

       <item>8. 'God' was changed to 'Gods' with some displacement of type in its vicinity.</item>

       <item>9. The defective 'f' was replaced.</item>

       <item>10. The comma was added.</item>
      </list>
     </p>

     <p>The Boston copy shows a very faint comma on I4<hi rend="super">v</hi> after 'outcasts' (line
      8) which is not visible in the Folger copy, but this is almost certainly due to faulty type or
      inking, and not to proof-correction. There are no certain variants between the two copies in
      this forme other than those listed above.</p>

     <p>It is clear that the proof-corrector was not thorough in marking faulty type (the page
      reproduced with this article shows several broken or badly inked letters that he missed), nor
      did he make every correction that a careful reading without reference to the copy could
      suggest (for example, on I4<hi rend="super">v</hi> both copies read 'gouernors &amp;,
      Primates'). But, on the other hand, the correction of 'human' to 'humane' shows that he had
      preferential spellings which he would demand even at the cost of a new justification of the
      type, and the correction of 'God' to 'Gods' shows that he could occasionally read carefully,
      and perhaps consult the copy. It should also be noted that as the proof-corrector was rushed
      or uneven in fulfilling his task, so the workman who followed his instructions did so
      imperfectly, by displacing type, using defective letters or failing to notice all the
      correction marks.</p>

     <p>Something further may be added about the variants in <hi rend="italic">King Lear</hi> and
       <hi rend="italic">The White Devil</hi>. If those in this one forme of <hi rend="italic">The
       Triple Antidote</hi> represent, as we may suppose, a normal treatment in this printing-house,
      then the belief that the variants in the other two works represent exceptional treatment is,
      by their dissimilarities, further strengthened. Moreover the fact that Okes' corrector was
      concerned with merely preferential changes and with purely typographical improvements in a
      book published in 1609, lends some support to Professor Fredson Bowers' contention that Okes
      was the sort of printer who was likely to do his 'conscientious best to produce the best text
      he could' from the 'miserable' manuscript copy for <hi rend="italic">Lear</hi> in 1608.<ref
       target="f011.16.05" n="5"><hi rend="super">5</hi></ref> The typographical improvements to <hi
       rend="italic">The Triple Antidote</hi> also imply <pb n="011.231"/> that there are probably
      more variants in both the other works than have been traced by human eyes alone, and that the
      full extent of their proof-correction during the printing of certain sheets will only be
      revealed by using an optical device such as that which Dr. C. Hinman is using on the first
      folio of Shakespeare.<ref target="f011.17.06" n="6"><hi rend="super">6</hi></ref> To search
      for such typographical variants would not be an idle task; if they exist they would enable us
      to claim that Okes was at least concerned with the appearance of his printed page in <hi
       rend="italic">King Lear</hi>, and they might help to determine which, in one or two doubtful
      formes, were the first states and which the 'corrected' ones.</p>

     <head/>
     <p>An anonymous single sheet in the Thomason Collection, together with certain entries in the
      MS Court Book of the Stationers' Company, tells the story of a contest which ranged from
      printing-house to Parliament and which illustrates not only the keen competition within the
      London trade during the mid-seventeenth century, but also the complexities that arose with
      reference to the printing of legal text-books.</p>

     <p>The pamphlet (BM 669. f.20 [74]), which has no date, title, or name of printer, is
      catalogued by Fortescue under March 1658. Thomason's MS. Legal Year dating is "March 1657". It
      tells how <q>About the 7<hi rend="super">th</hi> of <hi rend="italic">March</hi> 1655, Master
        <hi rend="italic">Whiting</hi> and Master <hi rend="italic">Spelman</hi> came to <hi
        rend="italic">Richard Hodgkinsonne</hi> to treat about the printing of Judge <hi
        rend="italic">Crookes<ref target="f011.17.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref></hi> (or
       Sir <hi rend="italic">George Crookes</hi>) Reports; desiring the said <hi rend="italic"
        >Hodg</hi>. to tell him truly and conscientiously, what he would print it for by the sheete
       and finde Paper? The sum the said <hi rend="italic">Hodgkinsonne</hi> then pitcht unto them
       was a farthing a sheete, the number printed being two thousand upon each sheete, and the
       Paper to be worth five shillings a Reame (<hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> five shillings and six
       pence perfect) so for that time they parted: But shortly after Master <hi rend="italic"
        >Whiting</hi> came to the said <hi rend="italic">Hodg.</hi> with one Master <hi
        rend="italic">Bacon</hi>, and desired the said <hi rend="italic">Hod.</hi> to make some
       Proves, which he accordingly did.</q>
      <q>About the 12 of <hi rend="italic">September</hi> 1656 Mr. <hi rend="italic">Jo.
        Whiting</hi>, and M. <hi rend="italic">Clem. Spelman</hi> went to the Warden of the <hi
        rend="italic">Stationers</hi>; where M. <hi rend="italic">Whiting</hi> desired to have Sir
        <hi rend="italic">G. Crookes</hi> Reports entred to the said <hi rend="italic"
        >Hodgkinsonne</hi>, <pb n="011.232"/> declaring unto the said Warden that he had agreed with
       the said <hi rend="italic">Hodg.</hi> for printing them and therefore willed him to take a
       care that none else should meddle with the printing of them.</q>
      <q>The 15 day M. <hi rend="italic">Whiting</hi>, M. <hi rend="italic">Spelman</hi> and <hi
        rend="italic">Hodg.</hi> went to the Clerk, where M. <hi rend="italic">Whiting</hi> declared
       the same words he had done before to the Warden, but the Clerke refused Entrance to the said
        <hi rend="italic">Hodg.</hi> upon pretence of a former entry to one <hi rend="italic"
        >Warren</hi>.</q>
      <q>The 16 day M. <hi rend="italic">Whiting</hi> and M. <hi rend="italic">Spelman</hi> went to
       Stationers-Hall, and there at a publique Court M. <hi rend="italic">Whiting</hi> disclaimed
       the Entrance of <hi rend="italic">Warren</hi>, as surreptitious, and declared his agreement
       with <hi rend="italic">Hodg</hi>. . . . but no Entry was made as he desired.</q> After two
      more unsuccessful attempts in October and January, Whiting complained <q>to the Lord
       Chiefe-Justice of the <hi rend="italic">Upper-Bench</hi>, who (accompanied with 3 or 4 other
       of the Judges) after hearing all that could be said by the Company for neglecting to enter to
        <hi rend="italic">Hodg.</hi> as also what <hi rend="italic">Warren</hi> could say for his
       pretended claim; <hi rend="italic">una voce</hi> Ordered, that the former pretended Entry to
        <hi rend="italic">Warren</hi>, so surreptitiously obtein'd, should be <hi rend="italic"
        >obliterate</hi>, and the said Copy be Entred <hi rend="italic">de novo</hi> to the said
       Hodgkinson.</q></p>


     <p>On the 20th of October, 1657,<ref target="f011.17.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref>
      Hodginson began to print "the 17 yeeres of King Charles". During the process, Whiting
      frequently visited "the Work-house" alone and with friends, to whom, and to the workmen, he
      declared that he had contracted with Hodgkinson to print the whole series, of which the
      present section amounted to less than one third.</p>


     <p>He also, before the workmen, chid Hodgkinson because he was still completing some other
      contracts, and "forbad him to entertain any other worke, assuring him that he would finde him
      worke for 7 yeers. And he hath", says the pamphlet, "driven Customers from his the said <hi
       rend="italic">Hodg.</hi> house." An instance of two unnamed Booksellers who on March 23rd
      vainly asked Hodgkinson to undertake as much as he would of the printing of Lord Hubbard's
      reports is quoted, and Whiting is said to have urged Hodgkinson to hurry on and take no other
      work because "there were reports of one <hi rend="italic">Bulstrode<ref target="f011.17.03"
        n="3"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref> Whitlocks</hi> printing, which he would not for 100 l.
      should come out before his 11 yeers of King <hi rend="italic">James</hi>", which he urged
      Hodgkinson to finish for him by Michaelmas.</p>


     <pb n="011.233"/>

     <p>Shortly before he had finished the Caroline copy, therefore, Hodgkinson asked Whiting
      whether that for <q>King <hi rend="italic">James</hi> his time were ready or not; if it were
       not, and that the presse, for want thereof, should stand still, it would be very chargeable:
       Whereupon within a day or two after M. <hi rend="italic">Whiting</hi> brought the said Copy
       into the said Work-house, where <hi rend="italic">Hodg.</hi> cast it off, and concluded that
       the last 11 yeers of King <hi rend="italic">James</hi> should make a second Volume. About the
       30 of <hi rend="italic">May</hi> King <hi rend="italic">Charles</hi> was finished, and <hi
        rend="italic">Hod.</hi> asking M. Whiting for the copy of King <hi rend="italic">James</hi>
       . . . M. <hi rend="italic">Whiting</hi> told him it was in Just. <hi rend="italic">Hales</hi>
       hand for perusall, but promised faithfully to bring it to him in a fortnight: The said . . .
        <hi rend="italic">Whiting</hi> came again within 2 or 3 dayes and desired <hi rend="italic"
        >Hodg.</hi> to provide work for a moneth, if he could; for (being tyred) he had a mind to
       goe into the Country; and then promised without faile to bring the said Copy to him, within a
       moneth; but failed then as before.</q></p>

     <p>Here the pamphlet infuriatingly ends, leaving the reader to check its accuracy for
       himself.<ref target="f011.17.04" n="4"><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref> The Stationers' Register
      has an entry under 4 July 1656 (Eyre &amp; Rivington, <hi rend="italic">Transcript</hi>),

      attempt at deletion, such as was ordered by the judges according to the pamphlet; nor is there
      any entry of the book to Hodgkinson. Wing, (<hi rend="italic">Short-Title Catalogue of English
       Books, 1641-1700</hi>) has no Hodgkinson entry either.</p>

      <pb n="011.234"/> A Parliamentary Order prefaced to the book and dated "Tuesday 9 June 1657",
      states that:&mdash; <q>Whereas Sir Harebotle Grimston, Baronet, hath of late revised and
       published in English a Book, entituled, The Reports of Sir George Croke Knight . . . which

       the said Books or any Copy thereof, either in French or English.</q></p>

     <p>The Order is signed in the customary way by Scobell. The book contains a recommendation,
      "Wee all, knowing the great Learning, Wisdome, and Integrity of the Author, do (for the common
      benefit) approve and allow of the publishing of this Book", signed by Judges Glynne, St. John,
      Atkins, Nicholas, Hale, Wyndham, Warburton, and Parker. It also contains the Preface by
      Grimston addressed "To the Students of the Common-laws of England" which is quoted below. This
      is dated "From my Manor-house of Gorhambury, May 7, 1657". On the final page is a list of
      Errata numbering 45 in all.</p>

     <p>Wing, under 'Sir George Croke', lists only one 1657 volume:&mdash;'The reports of. <hi
       rend="italic">By J. S.</hi>, 1657 fol.' This volume (BM 6121 i 1 is entitled &mdash; <q>THE /

      very attractive Hodgkinson copy. It has a different portrait-engraving as frontispiece and
      lacks the final emblem-engraving with which Hodgkinson concluded his book. It does not contain
      the Parliamentary Order. It compresses, by close printing, into 438 pages the section on which
      Hodgkinson lavished 603, and is therefore much more difficult to read. While Hodgkinson's
      Errata appear to be corrected, an equally long fresh list is inserted between Tables I and II,
      where it would not readily be observed. It contains the Preface, and the Judges'
      Recommendation, and the following Note to the Reader. <q>Thou art desired to take notice, That
       in the <hi rend="italic">Second Edition</hi> of this Book, many <hi rend="italic">grosse
        Errors</hi> of the former are exactly corrected; and the Errors of this <hi rend="italic"
        >Edition</hi> are carefully taken notice of in an Errata: So <pb n="011.235"/> that this
       Book is not onely more perfect then the former Impression, But also (for the good of the
       People of these Nations), it will be sold for half the Price.</q> This volume is too
      distinctly dated to be that referred to by J. M. Rigg under Grimston, Sir Harbottle, in the
       <hi rend="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</hi> (ed. 1890), which, after commenting
      that the "first volume of Grimston's translation of Croke's reports was published, with a life
      of the author, in 1657", adds, "There is also a very inaccurate edition of early but uncertain
      date". It is difficult to see which edition(s) Rigg is referring to here. Since the
      corrections indicated in Hodgkinson's "Errata" are carried out in the J. S. copy, one would,
      but for the dating, have thought that the Hodgkinson edition must be the "former" one referred
      to both in J. S.'s foreword and by Rigg as "inaccurate". But Hodgkinson too is clearly dated.
      It thus seems doubtful whether the "inaccurate edition of early date" referred to by the
      D.N.B. exists, unless Rigg never saw the Hodgkinson edition and referred to it.<ref
       target="f011.17.05" n="5"><hi rend="super">5</hi></ref> Rigg does, however, mention the
      Parliamentary Order, which appears only in Hodgkinson.</p>


     <p>Before turning to the version of the story in the Court Books of the Stationers' Company,
      some facts about the situation and certain of the characters should be summarised.</p>

     <p>The controversy about the printing of law-books which this story exemplifies is of
      particular interest between 1641 and 1660, because the future of a monopoly was in doubt.
      Edward VI had granted to Richard Tottel by letters patent, endorsed by Elizabeth,<ref
       target="f011.17.06" n="6"><hi rend="super">6</hi></ref> the exclusive right of printing
      common law books. This patent passed by grant through various hands until in the reign of
      James I it was granted to John More for forty years.<ref target="f011.17.07" n="7"><hi
        rend="super">7</hi></ref> More assigned his rights to Miles Fletcher, in return for an
      annuity plus a third of the profits. More died in 1638, leaving the annuity to Martha, his
      daughter, wife of Richard Atkyns, who thus through her acquired the patent.<ref
       target="f011.17.08" n="8"><hi rend="super">8</hi></ref>
      <pb n="011.236"/> Fletcher, trying to evade payment of the annuity, bought up More's stock and
      equipment, and sought to sell the rights to the Company of Stationers. The action which Atkyns
      brought against him and the Company was interrupted by the Civil War. From then until the
      Restoration, therefore, the issue was undecided. The Company of Stationers, anxious that so
      important and lucrative a right should be in their own hands, sought mean-while to establish a
      tradition of authorization via priority of entry in their register. After the Restoration,
      complicated litigation eventually favoured Atkyns; the Company, however, was able in 1661 to
      purchase the right, but had still to contend with counter-claims by the Fletchers. It was
      during the previous indeterminate period that, as described in the pamphlet, Sir Harbottle
      Grimston sought to publish the legal reports of Sir George Croke.</p>




     <p>Sir George Croke is most generally known as one of the two judges who, in 1638, found
      against King Charles I on the question of the legality of ship-money. He died in 1642, leaving
      his legal Reports, covering three reigns and ranging from 1580 to 1640, in the charge of his
      son-in-law, Harbottle Grimston. This was fitting, for Croke had made it a condition of the
      marriage of his daughter, Mary, to Grimston in 1629 that the legal practice which the latter,
      who was a barrister of Lincoln's Inn, had at that time discarded, should be resumed. It was
      excellent advice; Grimston rose rapidly in his profession, becoming in 1634 Recorder of
      Harwich, which he represented in Parliament from 1638, Recorder of Colchester (1638-49), and
      Colchester's representative in the Short and Long Parliaments, of which he was a conspicuous
      member. Politically, his position was complicated. Son of a Puritan baronet, he became Deputy
      Lieutenant of Essex and Chairman of the Committee which in 1647 investigated Charles I's
      escape from Hampton Court. Rushforth lists him as having taken the Covenant. Burnet, who later
      became his chaplain, says he did not. He led the Isle of Wight negotiations for a personal
      treaty, opposed regicide, and was purged by Pride in 1648, imprisoned for a short time, and,
      when returned to Parliament in 1656, excluded. From 1649-1660 he lived in retirement, latterly
      at Gorhambury, an estate which he had acquired through a second marriage &mdash; once more an
      alliance with a great legal family &mdash; to Anne, daughter of Sir Nathaniel Bacon.<ref
       target="f011.17.09" n="9"><hi rend="super">9</hi></ref> Part of this leisure (which was ended
      by his being elected Speaker of the Convention Parliament, in which capacity he rather
      floridly welcomed Charles II at the Restoration) he spent in wrestling with his former
      father-in-law's Reports.</p>


     <pb n="011.237"/>

     <p>This was no easy task. The Reports, extending over so many years and by so eminent an
      authority, would necessarily form a legal reference-book of first importance. The current
      demand for such works, together with the unsatisfactory way in which it then was often met, is
      described by Grimston in the Preface to the Reports, vol. i. <q><hi rend="italic">A multitude
        of flying Reports</hi> (<hi rend="italic">whose Authors are as uncertain as the times when
        taken, and the causes and reasons of the Judgements as obscure as by whom judged</hi>) <hi
        rend="italic">have of late surreptitiously crept forth; whereby, instead of that plentifull
        and profitable increase which those fields</hi> (<hi rend="italic">thus by a vigilant
        husbandman tilled</hi>) <hi rend="italic">would have yeelded to our Students, we have been
        entertained with barren and unwarranted Products . . . . which not only tends to the
        depraving the first grounds and reason of our Students at the Common Law, and the young
        Practitioners thereof, who by such false Lights are misled, and multiplicity of Law Suits
        rather cherished than suppressed</hi>: <hi rend="italic">But also to the con tempt . . . .
        of divers our former grave and learned Justcies</hi> (sic) <hi rend="italic">and Professors
        . . . . whose honoured and revered names have . . . . been abused and invocated to patronise
        the indigested crudities of those plagiaries</hi>.</q>
      <q>(<hi rend="italic">Reports</hi> of Sir George Croke (1657), sig. a2)</q> Grimston therefore
      took upon himself "the resolution and task of extracting and extricating" the Reports "out of
      their dark originalls". Dark not only because in accordance with Parliamentary policy they
      must now be published in English, not French, but also because they were exceedingly difficult
      to read, "<hi rend="italic">being written in so small and close an hand, that I may truly say
       they are</hi> folia sybillina, <hi rend="italic">as difficult as excellent</hi>." Grimston
      therefore used the help of "better eyes" than his own.</p>

     <p>That Richard Hodgkinson should have been much sought after at this time is not surprising.
      After difficulties financial, political, and professional, he had just reached the zenith of
      his fame as the printer (in 1655) of one of the most exacting and superbly printed books of
      the century, Sir William Dugdale's <hi rend="italic">Monasticon Anglicanum</hi> (vol. I). In
      1656 he printed, at the request of Sir Henry Spelman: "<hi rend="italic">Villare Anglicum</hi>
      / OR / A VIEW OF THE TOWNES / of ENGLAND". (BM E.484[3]) which contains an attractively
      written foreword from the Printer to the Reader. Sir Henry Spelman had first recommended
      Dugdale to serve in the Office of Arms, and first introduced him to Roger Dodsworth, who
      originated, and probably wrote most of <hi rend="italic">Monasticon</hi> but died before its
      completion.<ref target="f011.17.10" n="10"><hi rend="super">10</hi></ref> But the second
      volume of <hi rend="italic">Monasticon</hi> was to come in 1661 from the press of Alice
      Warren, <pb n="011.238"/> Thomas's widow,<ref target="f011.17.11" n="11"><hi rend="super"
        >11</hi></ref> and in 1656 Dugdale's <hi rend="italic">Antiquities of Warwickshire</hi> was
      printed by Thomas Warren. It seems possible, therefore, that round about 1655-56 rivalry
      existed between Hodgkinson and Warren towards the Dugdale-Spelman antiquarian axis. Warren was
      a skilful printer: he specialised in "portraictures cut in wood" (<hi rend="italic">Stat.
       Reg.</hi> 4 April 1656), and on 7 April 1656 is referred to as the printer of a 7-sheet map
      of London. He probably saw Hodgkinson's technical virtuosity, displayed in the first volume of
       <hi rend="italic">Monasticon</hi>, as a menace to his own prospects.</p>



     <p>The Clement Spelman mentioned in the pamphlet was probably Sir Henry's fourth son
      (1598-1679), barrister, and from 1660 bencher of Gray's Inn. He wrote in 1647 a tract entitled
       <hi rend="italic">Reasons for admitting the King to a Personal Treaty in Parlt. and not by
       Commissioners</hi><ref target="f011.17.12" n="12"><hi rend="super">12</hi></ref> and in 1648
      a <hi rend="italic">Letter to the Assembly of Divines concerning Sacrilege</hi>. According to
      the <hi rend="italic">D.N.B.</hi>, "there was another member of his family of somewhat similar
      age and the same name" who may have been the Clement Spelman listed on 24 April 1648 as a
      sequestered delinquent; he may also have been the Clement Spelman of the pamphlet.</p>


     <p>The number of members of the Bacon family "of somewhat similar age and the same name" during
      the 1650s has made it impossible to identify with certainly the Bacon<ref target="f011.17.13"
       n="13"><hi rend="super">13</hi></ref> mentioned in the pamphlet. It seems unlikely that
      Nathaniel Bacon, Member for Ipswich, is intended, as he was by now probably too well known to
      be mentioned by the vague "one Master Bacon". The Nicholas Bacon referred to at the end of
      this article may be a more likely candidate.</p>


     <p>The important question of the identity of Whiting is discussed later.</p>

     <p>The Court Book (1654-79) gives a more detailed account of the facts covered in the Thomason
      pamphlet, and adds much more. On 6 October 1656 Thomason and Leake were two of those present
      when <q>This day came to the Court Mr. Richard Hodgkinson Printer &amp; with him one Mr.
       Spilman and demanded Entrance of a Booke called Judge Crookes Reports which they produced but
       the same booke being already (in July last) entred to Thomas Warren by authority &amp;
       direction (as he asserts) of one Mr. Whiting y<hi rend="super">e</hi> Proprietor &mdash;
       &amp; that in presence of one Mr. Bacon and Mr. Dugdale not now present &mdash; And Mr.
       Warren affirming also that he was bargain'd withall by the said Mr. Whiting for printing One
       Impression of the said Copies according <pb n="011.239"/> to certain Articles agreed on &amp;
       drawn up (but not sealed) between them That he hath (in pursuance of the said agreement)
       caused to be cast a ffount of new Letter for ye doing thereof whereby he shall loose at least
       20l. &mdash; if he be prevented from Printing thereof. To w<hi rend="super">ch</hi> it was
       replied that Mr. Warren had not the booke it selfe in his custody but had procured an
       Entrance by a Title only to w<hi rend="super">ch</hi> Mr. Warden Norton had set his hand. The
       Table debate the business and resolve that they cannot give their judgment in the premises
       untill they heare the said Mr. Whiting Mr. Bacon and Mr. Dugdale, and withall desired both
       parties to referre themselves to such persons as themselves shall thinke fitt to nominate;
       but that way not done.</q> A further entry on 9 February 1656/7 runs:&mdash; <q>Memorand that
       since the last Court the Master &amp; Wardens &amp; Mr. Norton were summoned before the Lord
       Ch. Justice Glyn &amp; Justice Atkins at Serjeants Inne where it was ordered by their
       Lordships that the Entrance of the booke called Crookes Reports made to Mr. Warren (his right
       therein being overruled) should be oblitterated. And this day came again Mr. Spilman Mr.
       Whiting &amp; Mr. Hodgkinson to demand the same &amp; Entrance of the said Copie to Mr.
       Hodgkinson. But forasmuch as the matter of right<ref target="f011.17.14" n="14"><hi
         rend="super">14</hi></ref> in the Copie begot all the Controversie &amp; it not appearing
       that the present Claimers have any right derived from Sir Harb. Grimstone Esq<hi rend="super"
        >re</hi> to the Author it was proposed &amp; accordingly promised by Mr. Spilman to obtaine
       from the said S<hi rend="super">r</hi> Harbottle a Signification of his consent to the
       purpose afores<hi rend="super">d</hi>. W<hi rend="super">ch</hi> the Table enclined to do to
       prevent a new mischiefe.</q> On 2 March 1656/7, <q>came againe to the Court Mr. Spilman and
       Mr. Whiting with a writing under ye hand of S<hi rend="super">r</hi> Harbottle Grimston (as
       was averred) according to ye motion of the last Co<hi rend="super">rt</hi> but our Master who
       is imediately concerned (in ye L<hi rend="super">d</hi> Cheife Justices Order) being absent
       by reason of sickness Mr. Spilman was prayed to forbeare pressing the business . . . . untill
       the M<hi rend="super">r</hi>. could personally come to the Court.</q></p>


     <p>At this point there is a year's gap before the next relevant Court Book entry. It seems that
      between March 2nd and June 9th, 1657, application was made to Parliament by Whiting and
      Hodgkinson for vindication of the Judges' ruling, which was secured by the Parliamentary
      order: and that Hodgkinson's was the edition referred to by Bulstrode Whitlocke as published
      on 25th June. Between that date and January-March 1657/8 appeared the unauthorised "J. S."
      edition. It will be remembered that this edition purported to be sold "by the Stationers of
      London". It would be interesting <pb n="011.240"/> to know how much truth lay behind this
      expression. In 1664, John Streator printed under the name of Richard Atkyns the pamphlet
      entitled <hi rend="italic">The Original and Growth of Printing</hi>, in which the previous
      attitude of the Stationers (to which the writer of the 1664 pamphlet is opposed) is summed up
      thus:&mdash; <q>Say they, from the Year 1641 or 1642 until the . . . . Restauration, . . . .
       any Booksellers that listed, did print, or cause to be printed, such Law-Books as seemed good
       to them, without Restraint or Prohibition, occasioned by the Licence of the late Times. And
       that such as had Licence under the King's Grant to print Law-Books, were hindered to make the
       benefit of the same Grant; And that it was usual for such persons as printed Law-Books to
       enter the same in Stationers-Hall, and that it was conceived and taken, that such person and
       persons as Entred a Copy in the said Hall-Book to be Printed had the sole Right to print the
       same; and those that claim'd the Right of printing Law-Books under the King's Licence were
       thereby taken to be Excluded, and debarred to any Benefit therein. (<hi rend="italic">op.
        cit.</hi> pp. 15-16)</q></p>

     <p>In contrast to this policy, the Parliamentary Order of 9 June, 1657, might suggest some
      willingness on the part of the Commons to arrogate to themselves the previously royal right of
      granting the monopoly.<ref target="f011.17.15" n="15"><hi rend="super">15</hi></ref> Such an
      attitude might appear as a threat to the procedure of right by entry in the Register which the
      Stationers sought to establish. It may be that in our instance the retention of the Warren
      entry, the refusal of a Hodgkinson entry, the postponements and the varying reasons given for
      them, are factors in a coherent if improvised policy which, on 9 February 1656/7, when blocked
      by the Judges over the question of printing rights, introduced the issue of inherent right so
      that action on the other count might again be postponed.</p>


     <p>If so, it might seem possible that the J. S. edition could have been printed or initiated
      with the concealed (or open) support of the Stationers' Company, though the legally
      non-committal phrase "Stationers of London" may equally well indicate the contrary. The
      identity of J. S. is, however, a question here. The obvious claimants are the two men thus
      initialled who participated in printing subsequent abridgements of the Reports: John Starkey
      and John Streator. Streator, who partnered Warren in this the very next year, seems the more
      closely linked, since he was, as assign of Richard Atkyns, deeply and frequently involved in
      litigation about the printing of law books; he was certainly and emphatically the advocate, in
      1664, of individual (royal) rights, against the sale of the monopoly to the company of
      Stationers.</p>

     <p>Whatever the identity of J. S., we know that Whiting appealed to the House of Commons
      against the J. S. edition, for, while the <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> of the <pb
       n="011.241"/> House for 20 Jan. 1657/8 has the entry "The humble petition<ref
       target="f011.17.16" n="16"><hi rend="super">16</hi></ref> of John Whiteing, of Lincoln's-Inn,
      Esquire, was this day read", Burton's <hi rend="italic">Parliamentary Diary</hi> for the same
      day reports the following discussion: <q><hi rend="italic">Col. Cox.</hi></q>
      <q>Your order concerning Sir Harbotle Grimston's Reports was broken; it was a violation of
       your privilege. I desire the petition may be read.</q>
      <q>The title was 'To the Right Honourable the High Court of Parliament' and it was read
       without further debate. The substance of it was, that against the orders of the House, the
       book was reprinted, in bad paper, with many faults, &amp;c and that they called it a
       monopoly, and the Parliaments were so consequently. (<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>)</q>
      <q><hi rend="italic">Mr. Speaker</hi>.</q>
      <q>Upon complaint in this case, and to assert your privilege, I sent for three or four of the
       offenders, and bound them over to appear here the first day. There were some of them at the
       door even now.</q>
      <q><hi rend="italic">Major Beake</hi>.</q>
      <q>This is no breach of privilege, but rather a breach of the law. I would not have you to
       stay at the threshold, to take no order in this Case. Public business must take place, and if
       politicians meet with such an order upon your books, it will not look well to be the <hi
        rend="italic">Antisignanus</hi> of this house.</q>
      <q><hi rend="italic">Mr. Speaker</hi> moved that a Bill be read; but it was called on to
       adjourn.</q></p>


     <p>There is also evidence that Grimston himself, if he was disappointed at the number of Errata
      in Hodgkinson's edition, was enraged by those of the J. S. edition, for in his Preface to the
      second volume of the Reports<ref target="f011.17.17" n="17"><hi rend="super">17</hi></ref> he
      says, <q>I have been more than ordinarily careful in the Edition, that the Reverend Reporter
       may not be blemished with those many <hi rend="italic">Errata's</hi> in this, which have
       somewhat obscured the former:<ref target="f011.17.18" n="18"><hi rend="super">18</hi></ref>
       Especially in that latter Edition of it, by some ignorant and mercenary persons, who care not
       how they blot mens Credits, and therein wrong the Reader, as well as the Learned and
       Judicious Reporter, so they may have a vendible impression.</q></p>



     <p>He adds that if despite his efforts some errors have slipped in "You will <pb n="011.242"/>
      find them particularly corrected, in the usual place, after the end of this Book".<ref
       target="f011.17.19" n="19"><hi rend="super">19</hi></ref></p>


     <p>Whether because he had indeed previously made other arrangements, or because he felt that
      Hodgkinson had worked less accurately than the task demanded, or because he wanted no more
      bother with Whiting, Grimston seems to have decided to make a break over the printing of the
      Reports for King James's reign, which had for a time been placed in Hodgkinson's hands by
      Whiting. The Court Book on 19 Feb. 1657/8 has the entry that <q>William Godbie Printer this
       day brought a letter directed to the Table from S<hi rend="super">r</hi> Harbottle Grimstone
       dat. 16 ffeb. 57 purporting the said S<hi rend="super">r</hi> Harbottle's desire y<hi
        rend="super">t</hi> Judge Crooks Reports in the tyme of King James might be Entred as y<hi
        rend="super">e</hi> copie of William Godbie but Mr. Hodgkinson having formerly left a Caveat
       against the same and being now present desired forbearance of the Entrance of y<hi
        rend="super">e</hi> same &amp; s<hi rend="super">th</hi> that Mr. Whiting (Assignee to S<hi
        rend="super">r</hi> Harbottle as he will prove) agreed with him for printing the same with
       many other Reports of . . . . Judge Crooke &amp; that fraudently the said Whiting got the
       said Copie (being left with M<hi rend="super">r</hi> Hodgkinson) from him under pretence of
       Judge Hales perusing of it &amp; never brought the same back.</q></p>

     <p>Hodgkinson secured suspension of the entry of the Book to anybody, pending his proof of his
      allegations, which he promised to produce at the next Court. On 19th March 1657/8, says the
      Court Book, Godby brought to the Court a letter from Grimston repeating the request of Feb.
      16th and affirming the right to be in Godby only, "and that Mr. Hodgkinson was only employed
      in printing the Judiciall Reports which (if it had been Entred) he was to have given Bond for
      the copie." Hodgkinson presented a paper "purporting an assertion of his right in the Copie of
      the above Reports not only with consent but speciall approbation &amp; direction of . . .
      Grimstone and protesting against what shall be done to the prejudice of such his right." The
      Table decided to decide nothing at present but told the Clerk to go to Gorhambury, taking
      Hodgkinson's paper, and give Grimston a copy of it, asking to be fully informed about it. On
      March 26th, 1658, Godby presented to the Table Grimston's reply, which stated that Grimston
      "denies he ever assigned to Mr. Whiting his interests in any of Judge Crook's Reports except
      the Judiciall Reports in the first seventeen yeares of King Charles 2<hi rend="super"
       >ndly</hi> That Mr. Whiting's promise to Mr. Hodgkinson of printing the other parts . . .
      cannot devest S<hi rend="super">r</hi> Harbottle of his property . . . But admitting Mr. Hodg.
      had such a promise from Mr. Whiting or himself (which he utterly denies) he has no remedy upon
      failure of performance but to bring his case . . . to recover his Damages. . . ."</p>

     <p>It would not, says Grimston, be for the Company to "meddle" with such action, but to "leave
      him to a legall way". Grimston then repeats his request for assignment to Godby.</p>

     <pb n="011.243"/>

     <p>The court at last decided, at the end of the sitting, that though Hodgkinson had shown the
      Table a copy signed by several witnesses to the agreement with Whiting, this was, as Grimston
      urged, a legal matter, not a case for them to decide: since Hodgkinson's possible redress
      would not be prejudiced by entry of the Reports to Godby, it was decided to assign the
      Jacobean volume to him.<ref target="f011.17.20" n="20"><hi rend="super">20</hi></ref></p>


     <p>Hodgkinson had thus won the first round only to be defeated in the second. But though he
      appears to have sought no legal redress, he did take what is now called unilateral action, for
      a Court Book minute of 7 February 1658/9 records that he had been found at some previous date
      "printing Judge Crook's Reports contrary to order" and his goods were seized and taken to
      Stationers' Hall. A "friendly agreement" having now been reached between Hodgkinson and Field
      (the bookseller for whom Godby and Newcomb issued the Jacobean volume in 1659) it was decided
      that these should be restored.</p>

     <p>Grimston's labours continued. The second Part, commended by eight Judges and without
      Parliamentary Order, was duly printed by T. Newcomb and W. Godbie, to be sold by John Field at
      the Seven Stars in Fleet-Street, in 1659. Both of the copies I have seen (BM 6128.f.3 and that
      in the Library of the Institute of Historical Research, London) have been rebound, which may
      possibly account for the absence in each of the Errata, referred to by Grimston in the
      Preface. (The Second Edition of Part II (1669) describes itself as "corrected".) The First
      Part (for Elizabeth's reign) appeared in 1661 "Printed by and for <hi rend="italic">John Field
       and Tho. Newcomb</hi>: <hi rend="italic">Also for W. Lee, D. Pakeman, and Gabriel
      Bedell</hi>." It has a highly rhetorical Dedication to King Charles II in which Grimston avers
      that the Third and Second Parts would have been similarly dedicated but for "the extream
      difficulty of publick Address to Your Majesties Sacred Person, divided from Your good
      Subjects, by the cruel, wicked, bloody, and desperate practises of horrid Intruders and
      Usurpers", which had forced him to send them abroad with only a Preface. The names of eleven
      Judges, but no Parliamentary Order, commend it. The Errata, inserted between the reports and
      the Tables, form a staggering list of 57 lines in each of two columns in very small print.
      Perhaps, after all, Grimston would have been better advised to stick to Hodgkinson.</p>

     <p>The equivocal part played by Whiting in this story deserves comment. The chief clue to his
      identity is the "of Lincolne's-Inn" description in the Parliamentary Journal for 20 January
      1657/8, which seems to fix him as the John Whiting, son and heir of Thomas Whiting of
      Saxlingham, Norfolk, who was admitted on 10 November 1624, and had been admitted pensioner <pb
       n="011.244"/> at Caius, Cambridge, on 28 May 1619, "son of Thos. Gent., of Saxlingham,
      Norfolk". The BM catalogue describes him as "Bookseller", on the strength of the word
      "Proprietor" in the Thomason pamphlet, one supposes, for his name occurs in no other place
      where a bookseller's should, so far as I can discover.</p>

     <p>It will have been noticed that throughout the story Grimston never appears in person. He
      would scarcely have felt himself <hi rend="italic">persona grata</hi> in London during the
      year following his exclusion from Parliament. He may therefore in the first instance have
      acted through a friend, representative, or associate rather than a stationer. In the Preface
      to the Hodgkinson volume he mentions the help of "better eyes" than his own. Such a helper
      would need to have had a legal training and/or practice with documents. John Whiting of
      Lincoln's Inn would possess these qualifications. Roger Dodsworth, in a letter to Sir William
      Dugdale dated by Hamper (<hi rend="italic">Life, Diary &amp; Correspondence of Sir William
       Dugdale</hi>, 1827) March 1649/50, says: "Mr. Whiting was w<hi rend="super">th</hi> me this
      morning, and tells me ther is a great man called Paston, whose father was a studious man after
      antiquities, especially Abbey Books, and hath left Collections out of divers, w<hi
       rend="super">ch</hi> Mr. Whiting is to p'use. He will serve you by Sir Charles Mordants'
      deeds", and on 10 May, 1651, he tells Dugdale that Mr. Whiting has "come up last weeke but is
      gone today w<hi rend="super">th</hi> rare Historical notes out of several Registers he found
      in Suffolke, touching St. Edmundsbury."</p>

     <p>In an article by Falconer Madan in the <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi> (3 November 1888)
      which reprints the previously missing section of Dugdale's diary for 1656, occurs, under 14
      September, the entry:&mdash;"Sent to Mr. Martin the Register at Lichfield 6<hi rend="super"
       >s</hi>, whereof 2<hi rend="super">s</hi>6<hi rend="super">d</hi> I am to receive of Mr.
      Whiting the Lawyere,<ref target="f011.17.21" n="21"><hi rend="super">21</hi></ref> it being
      for the search of the will of one Thwaites of Henoure." Since "Mr. Dugdale", according to the
      Court Book, accompanied Whiting on his Hodgkinson negotiations, it seems that the Whiting
      referred to above, who may have been recommended to Grimston by the Dugdales as one competent
      to help in deciphering Croke's sibylline leaves, would be a not unlikely person for Grimston
      to choose as his negotiator. If he made any subsequent excursions into the world of the
      printers of law books, he would have needed to walk warily after the Restoration, for Grimston
      then became Master of the Rolls.</p>


     <p>There remains a faint and very conjectural possibility that after the Restoration two, or
      perhaps three, of the participants in this story ("Master" Bacon, Grimston, and very
      improbably J. S.) encountered each other again. In the case of le Roy versus Bacon (Mich. 16
      Car. II BR) the latter <pb n="011.245"/> was indicted (I quote Levinz<ref target="f011.17.22"
       n="22"><hi rend="super">22</hi></ref>) "for intending to murder the Master of the Rolls, and
      for offering 100 l. to J. S.. to do it and saying, that if he would not he would do it
      himself."</p>


     <p>Keble<ref target="f011.17.23" n="23"><hi rend="super">23</hi></ref> gives the accomplice's
      name as Parry and agrees with Siderfin<ref target="f011.17.24" n="24"><hi rend="super"
        >24</hi></ref> and Levinz about the cause, that Grimston "on Misdemeanours in a Cause in
      Chancery referred to him, made an order which displeased the Defendant." The <hi rend="italic"
       >D.N.B.</hi> refers to this Bacon as Nathaniel.<ref target="f011.17.25" n="25"><hi
        rend="super">25</hi></ref> It is clear, however, from <hi rend="italic">Heathcote MSS</hi>
      November, 1664, p. 170 (News Letter) that this is an error: "Mr. Nicholas Bacon, a barrister
      of Grey's Inn, being found guilty of endeavouring the death of Sir Harbottle Grimston, Master
      of the Rolls, has been sentenced to 1,000 Marks fine, 3 months' imprisonment, and to make
      public acknowledgment of his offence at the Kings Bench Bar &amp; Chancery." And the Christian
      name is confirmed by an entry in <hi rend="italic">Cal. St. Pa. Dom. Ch. II</hi>, 1667, vol.
      ii, p. 116, 23rd May: "Warrant for a grant to Sir John Denham, surveyor of works, and Thos.
      Killigrew, groom of the bedchamber, of a fine of 600 l. imposed on Nich. Bacon, of Gray's Inn,
      convicted four years ago for contriving the death of Sir Harbottle Grimstone, Master of the
      Rolls."</p>




     <p>Whether this Nicholas was the "Master Bacon" of the Thomason pamphlet, one cannot tell.
      There can however be little doubt that he was the writer of the letter to Grimston which in
      H.M.C. <hi rend="italic">Report on the MSS of the Earl of Verulam at Gorhambury, 1906</hi> is
      headed (p.95) "Anonymous letter to Sir Harbottle Grimston, Master of the Rolls", and which
      suggests an enmity of longer standing than the immediate issue; part of it runs:&mdash; <q>I
       have a cause Depending in Chancery which has already beene branded with your notorious
       partiality, and by consequence I expect that at the hearing . . . . it will receive as
       palpable tokens of your injustice . . . . I have sent this as a monitor to forewarne you that
       you do mee justice at your peril, or expect Buckingham's fate, although I were never soe
       certaine of Felton's end, for I shall thinke myselfe happy enough that I liv'd to punish
       audacious injustice, especially when it shrouds itselfe under robes of justice and power . .
       . . Sir, believe mee neither foole, mad man nor huff, for if the case would beare it, that I
       could tell you my name, you would know that I both dare and will doe as I say.</q> The
      attempt and not the deed confounded Bacon. Grimston continued to wear the "robes of justice
      and power" until 1685, when Cooke's letter in the <hi rend="italic">Lefroy Papers</hi> informs
      us, under 2nd January, that "the Old Master of <pb n="011.246"/> the Rolls, Sir Harbottle
      Grimston, hath made shift to die at last from apoplexy."</p>

     <p>If earlier pages of <hi rend="italic">Studies in Bibliography</hi><ref target="f011.18.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref> 
      suggested that, in Irish printing
      of the seventeenth century, nothing need necessarily be what it seems, the fact perhaps
      reveals a fundamental and characteristic trait in Irish life, as true of its politics and its
      Church as of its bibliography.<ref target="f011.18.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref>
      While the essay in question stressed the existence of false places of publication in
      Irishprinted books, it now appears that on occasion even imprint dates may also be
      misleading.</p>



     <p>Of the numerous political events which harrowed Ireland in the seventeenth century the
      Cromwellian Settlement is one of the most significant.<ref target="f011.18.03" n="3"><hi
        rend="super">3</hi></ref> On the return to England of Charles II one of his first steps was
      the restoration to his dispossessed Irish supporters of their lands, promulgated in a <hi
       rend="italic">Gracious Declaration for the Settlement of . . . Ireland</hi>. After having
      been detained in England by the marriage of Charles II to Catherine of Braganza, the Duke of
      Ormonde in turn lost no time when he arrived in Dublin as Lord Lieutenant in giving the Royal
      Assent to the Act of Settlement passed in 1662 by the Irish Parliament to implement the
      principles set forth by <pb n="011.247"/> Charles. That the Act resulted in numerous
      inequities and much confusion will not surprise the reader of J. P. Prendergast's <hi
       rend="italic">Ireland from the Restoration to the Revolution</hi> (1887), and, almost
      inevitably, it was necessary in 1665 to pass a further <hi rend="italic">Act for the
       Explaining of some Doubts</hi> amending the Act of Settlement of 1662. By means of these two
      Acts, in Brian FitzGerald's words, "Amidst confusion and heartburning, the ownership of the
      land of Ireland became once more determined. And . . . this time the settlement endured. It
      was to maintain the Anglo-Irish Ascendancy for the next two hundred and fifty years".<ref
       target="f011.18.04" n="4"><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref></p>



     <p>As historical documents the two Acts in their published form will be recognized for their
      vital importance.<ref target="f011.18.05" n="5"><hi rend="super">5</hi></ref> But, being
      Irish in origin, the two items may be confidently counted on to offer complications.</p>


     <p>Bibliographically this they indeed do. For of the 1662 Act of Settlement there prove to be
      two distinct settings of type, distinguished in the Bradshaw Catalogue in terms of the type
      ornaments which border the title page: in one (Bradshaw 58), the ornaments consist of double
      rosettes (as in a horizontal S), while in the other (Bradshaw 59) they comprise fleurs-de-lis.
      No explanation of the relation of the two appears however ever to have been advanced.</p>

     <p>As a matter of fact, such an explanation is not far to seek. It is hinted at in a variant
      copy of the two Acts in the British Museum which has not hitherto been seriously considered.
      The copy in question combines the fleur-de-lis edition of the 1662 Act of Settlement with a
      copy of the 1665 Act of Explanation. In the latter the half-title and the title page have been
      cancelled, while on p. 3 the woodcut headpiece and caption ("An&deg; Regni Caroli . . . His
      Majesties reign", a total of 14 lines) have been removed from the forme. In this guise the two
      acts appear as a bibliographical unit.</p>

     <p>This unity has further meaning for us, when one observes that the title border of the 1665
      Act of Settlement also consists of fleurs-de-lis. That what has happened is patently this:
      With the promulgation of the 1665 Act of Explanation, further copies of the original Act of
      Settlement were required for point of reference. The supply being either exhausted or at least
      insufficient, it was necessary to print a new edition, and in doing so the typographic style
      and ornamentation of the 1665 Act of Explanation itself were followed. Possibly for legalistic
      reasons the original 1662 imprint date was retained. But it now appears that the imprint of
      the edition of the Act of Settlement with fleur-de-lis border should read, bibliographically
      speaking: <pb n="011.248"/>
      <hi rend="italic">Dublin, Printed by John Crook, Printer to the Kings Most Excellent Majesty,
       1662</hi> [i. e., 1665?].<ref target="f011.18.06" n="6"><hi rend="super">6</hi></ref></p>


     <p>If in the writer's "Deception in Dublin" emphasis was laid on false imprints, it is equally
      true that the matter was not exhausted. As a case in point, the Trinity College, Cambridge,
      Library possesses an edition of <hi rend="italic">A Proclamation concerning A Cessation of
       Arms</hi> with the imprint "Printed at Dublin, by William Bladen, printer to the Kings most
      Excellent Majestie, Anno Dom. 1643", which collates: 1 leaf, 17 pp. (A-B<hi rend="super"
       >4</hi> C<hi rend="super">2</hi>). On p. 1 appears a factotum block, and on p. 16 are used a
      number of open-face acorn ornaments. Neither is found, however, in other Bladen publications
      of the period, and the Dublin origin of the pamphlet is open to suspicion.</p>

     <p>Of this Proclamation and related documents, the result of negotiations between the Duke of
      Ormonde, representing the government of Charles I, and the Supreme Council of Confederate
      Catholics at Kilkenny there are numerous editions in various forms. There is, for instance, a
      broadside declaration of the Confederate Catholics printed at Waterford in 1643, described by
      Robert Steele in his Tudor and Stuart Proclamations (Ir 390), and entered by Wing apparently
      twice, as I 354 and again as I 394. There is also a pamphlet edition of the larger work with
      Bladen's imprint as given above, collating this time: 1 leaf, 17 (<hi rend="italic">i.
      e.</hi>, 18) pp. (A-B<hi rend="super">4</hi> C<hi rend="super">2</hi>), with p. 18 misnumbered
      17, and, on p. 1, Steele's arms no. 172. This edition appears to be that described by Wing as
      C2559, under Charles I; and again, under Ireland, as I 604. A similar pamphlet edition has the
      imprint "Imprinted at Dublin, By William Bladen, Printer to the Kings most Excellent Majesty,
      Anno Dom. 1643", collating: 1 leaf, 18 pp. (A-C<hi rend="super">4</hi>, with A1 and C4 blank),
      of which p. 1 is misnumbered 2. It too contains Steele's arms no. 172. This edition seems not
      to be in Wing at all. And finally there is a London edition with the imprint "Dublin, by
      William Bladen; reprinted at London for Edw. Husbands, October 21. 1643". On this edition Wing
      lavishes three locations, with varying degrees of accuracy in his descriptions: under Charles
      I, as C2560; under Ireland, as I 605; and under Ormonde, as O 457.</p>

     <p>Oddly enough, it is this London edition which provides the clue to the probable identity of
      our mysterious edition. For on the very title page of the Husbands' edition are the open-face
      acorns which aroused our earlier suspicions. What printer worked for Husbands at this period?
      He is named in the imprint of a June 23, 1643, edition of <hi rend="italic">Two Letters from
       His Excellencie Robert Earl of Essex</hi> as John Field. An examination of various works <pb
       n="011.249"/> printed in Field's shop reveals that it possessed both the acorns and the
      factotum block of our curious "Dublin" edition. That this last was a piracy perpetrated in
      Field's shop seems likely, a quite unauthorized edition in the face of Husbands' commission by
      Parliament (cited on the title page) plausian entry in the Stationers' Register in Husbands'
      name. No less than plausible is the theory that Field on receiving a copy of the Dublin
      edition from which to set up an edition for Husbands chose to pirate an edition, rather closer
      in appearance typographically to the Dublin original than Husbands'. The fact that Husbands
      was a political appointee as publisher for the Roundhead Parliament, a sort of intruder in the
      printing trade, may have done much to assuage any moral scruples which Field had.</p>

     <p>The really frightening question is to what degree Field or others may have engaged in this
      practice at Husbands' expense. For it becomes increasingly likely that the suspicious <hi
       rend="italic">Declaration of the Commons</hi> with the imprint "London, printed for Edward
      Husband Feb. 16, 1647. Reprinted at Kilkenny in the yeare 1648" is a comparable example of a
      similar practice.<ref target="f011.18.07" n="7"><hi rend="super">7</hi></ref> Is it now going
      to be necessary to re-examine the hundreds of works printed for Husbands during the period of
      the Commonwealth for further instances of piracy, relevant not only to Irish books but to
      English works as well?</p>

     <p>Beginning with Sir John Hawkins, almost every writer<ref target="f011.19.01" n="1"><hi
        rend="super">1</hi></ref> who has commented on the matter has declared that John Newbery,
      the bustling "philanthropic bookseller" of <hi rend="italic">The Vicar of Wakefield</hi> and
      one of the best known publishers of the eighteenth century, was the projector of the <hi
       rend="italic">Universal Chronicle</hi>&mdash;a shortlived (1758-1760)<ref
       target="f011.19.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref> paper remembered now largely because
      Dr. Johnson's <hi rend="italic">Idler</hi> (and other pieces)<ref target="f011.19.03" n="3"
        ><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref> first appeared in it. Yet no evidence has been published<ref
       target="f011.19.04" n="4"><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref> to support Hawkins's assertion, and
      one <pb n="011.250"/> modern scholar has ventured the opinion that Hawkins "confused" the <hi
       rend="italic">Universal Chronicle</hi> with <hi rend="italic">Lloyd's Evening Post, and
       British Chronicle</hi>, of which "Newbery was one of the projectors."<ref target="f011.19.00"
       n="4a"><hi rend="super">4a</hi></ref></p>






     <p>The Bodleian Library contains a complete, and the British Museum a virtually complete (only
      one number&mdash;65&mdash;is missing), set of the <hi rend="italic">Universal Chronicle</hi>;
      and a study of the advertisements appearing in the paper yields interesting evidence, I think,
      on the question of Newbery's connection with it for at least the longer part of its life.
      Before presenting the results of such an examination, however, it may be relevant to note the
      principal events in the paper's history. The <hi rend="italic">Chronicle</hi> ran for 105,
      eight-page numbers&mdash;from Saturday, April 8, 1758 to Saturday, March 29-Saturday, April 5
      1760. Nos. 1-4 were entitled <hi rend="italic">The Universal Chronicle, or Weekly Gazette</hi>
      and were "Printed for <hi rend="italic">J. Payne</hi>, in <hi rend="italic"
       >Pater-noster-Row</hi>"; Nos. 5-39 were entitled <hi rend="italic">Payne's Universal
       Chronicle, or Weekly Gazette</hi>. A note at the bottom of the first page of No. 39 stated
      that "This Paper, for the future, will be published by Mr. STEVENS, next Door to the <hi
       rend="italic">Chapter Coffee-house</hi>, in <hi rend="italic">Pater-noster-Row</hi>"; and
      beginning with No. 40 and extending through No. 91, the paper's name reverted to the original
       <hi rend="italic">Universal Chronicle</hi>, etc., and "Printed for <hi rend="italic">J.
       Payne</hi>," etc. was altered to "Printed for <hi rend="italic">R. Stevens</hi>, at <hi
       rend="italic">Pope's</hi>-Saturday, April 8, 1758 to Saturday, March 29-Saturday, April 5,
      1760. Nos. 92-105 were entitled <hi rend="italic">The Universal Chronicle, and Westminster
       Journal</hi>; Nos. 92-101 were "Printed for W. Faden, in <hi rend="italic">Wine-Office-Court,
       Fleetstreet</hi>; and R. Stevens," etc.; Nos. 102-05 were printed for R. Stevens only.</p>

     <p>The first 29 numbers of the <hi rend="italic">Chronicle</hi> contain only one small
      advertisement, although the colophon of Nos. 2-29 informed the reader that "Advertisements . .
      are taken in" at "<hi rend="italic">Pater-noster-Row</hi>" and although the "<hi rend="italic"
       >Proprietor</hi>(s)" announced in No. 29 that "<hi rend="italic">As this Paper is now so well
       established as to exceed the . . . most sanguine Expectations. . . . We intend, for the
       future, to insert Advertisements, but such Advertisements only will be admitted as are
       perfectly decent, and intended to promote Trade, or that are otherwise serivceable to the
       Publick</hi>." Of the remaining 76 numbers, 58 contain a total of 150 advertisements; 18 <ref
       target="f011.19.05" n="5"><hi rend="super">5</hi></ref> do not contain any. The 150
      advertisements, a majority of which appear in Nos. 30-98, may be divided into two groups, [1]
      those (93) dealing with printed matter&mdash;mostly books&mdash;and [2] those (57) concerned
      with miscellaneous objects&mdash;principally patent medicines&mdash;and services. Fifty-four
      advertisements in the first group bear the name of "<hi rend="italic">J. Newbery</hi>" and
      another four announce the publication of Newbery's <hi rend="italic">Public Ledger</hi>; ten
      more bear the name of "<hi rend="italic">T. Carnan</hi>," <pb n="011.251"/> "believed to have
      been" Newbery's stepson, who "was intimately associated with him in his business";<ref
       target="f011.19.06" n="6"><hi rend="super">6</hi></ref> the remaining twenty-five belong to
      various other publishers, including J. Payne. Thirty-nine advertisements in the second group
      extol the virtues of "Dr. James's Powder," "sold only by J. Newbery," and of Thomas
      Greenough's "tincture," sold both by the "patentee" and by J. Newbery; most of the other
      eighteen are divided between announcements of the sale of linens, dress materials, etc. and a
      public notice regarding the "<hi rend="italic">King's Packet-Boats</hi>." To sum up, John
      Newbery is clearly associated with ninety-seven of the 150 advertisements, T. Carnan with
      another ten, making a total of 107, a number more than twice that of all other advertisements
      in the <hi rend="italic">Chronicle</hi>.</p>



     <p>Different kinds of analyses reveal similar disproportions between Newbery and non-Newbery
      advertisements. Twenty-seven numbers of the <hi rend="italic">Chronicle</hi> contain
      Newbery's, and only Newbery's, announcements about printed matter, whereas five numbers
      contain only advertisements by "outsiders." Nineteen numbers contain only advertisements of
      Dr. James's Powder and Greenough's tincture, whereas thirteen contain only announcements
      concerning other miscellaneous things. Of the ten books (or groups of books) advertised most
      frequently, eight are Newbery publications and another is T. Carnan's <hi rend="italic"
       >Nonpareil</hi>.</p>

     <p>Finally, two specific advertisements should be offered as evidence on the problem of
      Newbery's connection with the <hi rend="italic">Chronicle</hi>. In No. 93 (for January 5-12,
      1760) of the paper appears an announcement<ref target="f011.19.07" n="7"><hi rend="super"
        >7</hi></ref> of the publication of the first number of Newbery's <hi rend="italic">Public
       Ledger</hi>; in Nos. 96, 97, and 98 is reprinted the sizable preliminary address "to the
      public" which was published in No. 1 of the <hi rend="italic">Ledger</hi>. An extensive, but
      not, of course, exhaustive, search has failed to turn up either the announcement of the
      initial publication of the <hi rend="italic">Ledger</hi> or the preliminary address in any
      other newspaper.<ref target="f011.19.08" n="8"><hi rend="super">8</hi></ref>
     </p>



     <p>These facts speak for themselves. It is hardly credible that Newbery, an eminently
      successful bookseller, should have placed two-thirds of the total number of advertisements in
      a paper in which he had no financial interest and which, by all available signs, was scarcely
      flourishing and may well have been struggling; it seems highly probable, on the other hand,
      that he was one, perhaps even the principal, proprietor of the <hi rend="italic"
       >Chronicle</hi> at least during its life from No. 30 through No. 105, and that he used its
      pages as a medium for advertising his other wares.</p>

     <p>In an article published a number of years ago,<ref target="f011.20.01" n="1"><hi
        rend="super">1</hi></ref> Professor E. L. McAdam, Jr. demonstrated Dr. Johnson's authorship
      of the three "Weekly Correspondent" essays in the <hi rend="italic">Public Ledger</hi> for
      December 2, 9, and 16, 1760, and suggested at the same time that Johnson "corrected and
      revised, if he did not write, the preliminary address to the public" (p. 204) which was
      printed in the first number (January 12, 1760) of the paper. Although to my knowledge no one
      has previously noted the fact, a much shorter notice regarding the <hi rend="italic"
       >Ledger</hi> appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Universal Chronicle, and Westminster
       Journal</hi><ref target="f011.20.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref> for January 5-12, 1760 (No. 93);
      and I believe, largely but not solely on the basis of similarities in thought and style, that
      Johnson was also the author of this piece. Since files of the <hi rend="italic">Universal

      <p>Though what is already said may be sufficient to explain so much of our Scheme as is at
       present necessary to be known, yet Custom has <pb n="011.253"/> established a kind of Law,
       that he who sollicits the public Favour should lay before the Public his Pretensions, that
       they may know on what Terms they are to receive him into their Service; and the Pretensions
       and Promises made on these Occasions have often been so complex or extensive, as not to be
       fulfilled even with the utmost Skill and Assiduity.</p>
      <p>This perhaps may be suspected of the Paper here proposed; for the Public has a Right to
       suspect, and to be satisfied; but the Projectors have also a Right to propose, and to be
       heard: Where the Benefit is reciprocal, and a Man serves others with an equal Advantage to
       himself, the Obligation is equal; but if he conveys more Benefit than he receives, he has
       Merit to plead in his Favour, and is not only entitled to Attention, but to
       Encouragement.</p>
      <p>This Attention the Proprietors of the above Paper claim, and some Encouragement they hope
       for; as their Scheme, they apprehend, is not only new, but of a Nature more generally useful
       to Mankind than any Publication which has hitherto been offered: For a particular Explanation
       of it, however, they refer the Reader to the first Paper, which will be delivered <hi
        rend="italic">Gratis</hi> at the Place above-mentioned.</p>
     </q>

     <p>External evidence supporting the attribution consists, briefly, of (1) the fact that a short
      time before January, 1760 Johnson had written a similar, one-paragraph notice "To the Public"
      in the advertisement (October 3, 1759) for John Newbery's <hi rend="italic">World
       Displayed</hi> as well as the introduction (December 1, 1759) to that work;<ref
       target="f011.20.04" n="4"><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref> and (2) the assumption that, as most
      writers have declared and as an examination of the advertisements suggests,<ref
       target="f011.20.05" n="5"><hi rend="super">5</hi></ref> Newbery, the publisher of the <hi
       rend="italic">Public Ledger</hi>, was also one of the proprietors of the <hi rend="italic"
       >Universal Chronicle</hi>, in which both the <hi rend="italic">Idler</hi> and other pieces by
      Johnson were printed.<ref target="f011.20.06" n="6"><hi rend="super">6</hi></ref> No. 92 of
      the <hi rend="italic">Idler</hi>, for instance, appeared in the same number of the <hi
       rend="italic">Chronicle</hi> as that in which the notice I attribute to Johnson was
      published.</p>




     <p>Turning to the notice itself, I believe I detect in each of the sentences <pb n="011.254"/>
      the genuine Johnsonian hallmark. Specifically, it is difficult to believe that Johnson did not
      write "for the Public has a Right to suspect, and to be satisfied; but the Projectors have
      also a Right to propose, and to be heard"; "if he conveys more Benefit than he receives, he
      has Merit to plead in his Favour, and is not only entitled to Attention, but to
      Encouragement"; and "as their Scheme, they apprehend, is not only new, but of a Nature more
      generally useful to Mankind than any Publication which has hitherto been offered."</p>

     <p>Moreover, the striking resemblances between parts of the notice (especially the first half
      of the first sentence) and passages in several other pieces by Johnson, both earlier and later
      than 1760, afford fairly solid evidence, I think, for giving the notice a small place in the
      Johnsonian canon. For example, in the Introduction to the <hi rend="italic">Harleian
       Miscellany</hi> (1744), Johnson began, "<hi rend="italic">Though</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
       >Scheme</hi> . . . is so obvious, that the Title alone is <hi rend="italic">sufficient to
       explain</hi> it . . . ." In the <hi rend="italic">Proposals for the Publisher</hi> (1744), he
      wrote, "Such is the Design which <hi rend="italic">the Publick</hi> is now <hi rend="italic"
       >solicited</hi> to <hi rend="italic">favour</hi>." In the <hi rend="italic">Rambler</hi>, No.
      1 (1750), he remarked, "If a man could glide imperceptibly into the <hi rend="italic">favour
       of the public</hi> and only proclaim his <hi rend="italic">pretensions</hi> . . . when he is
      sure of not being rejected"; and in the <hi rend="italic">Rambler</hi>, No. 40 (1750) he used
      the phrase "<hi rend="italic">skill and assiduity</hi>." In the Preface to the <hi
       rend="italic">Catalogue</hi> of the Society of Artists (1762), he declared, "The <hi
       rend="italic">public</hi> may justly require to be inform'd of the nature and extent of every
      design, for which the <hi rend="italic">favour</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">public</hi> is
      openly <hi rend="italic">solicited</hi>." And in the address "To the Public" concerning the
       <hi rend="italic">Literary Magazine</hi> (1756), he wrote, in the closest parallel I have
      found, "There are some Practices which <hi rend="italic">custom</hi> and prejudice have so
      unhappily influenced, that to observe or neglect them is equally censurable. The <hi
       rend="italic">promises</hi> made by the Undertakers of any new Design, every Man thinks
      himself at liberty to deride, and <hi rend="italic">yet</hi> every Man expects, and expects
      with reason, <hi rend="italic">that he who solicits the Public Attention</hi> should give some
      account of his <hi rend="italic">pretensions</hi>."<ref target="f011.20.07" n="7"><hi
        rend="super">7</hi></ref></p>


     <p>Finally, in spite of the <hi rend="italic">caveat</hi> about deducing the authorship of a
      given piece from another work whose attribution is itself uncertain, it can still be pointed
      out that (1) the explicit reference at the end of the notice to the "particular Explanation"
      which Mr. McAdam attributes (rightly, I think), in whole or part, to Johnson, provides at
      least slight evidence for Johnson's authorship of the notice; that (2) the concluding words of
      the "preliminary address"&mdash;"a clear Title to the <hi rend="italic">Favour</hi> and Esteem
      of the <hi rend="italic">Public</hi>, which is what we are most <hi rend="italic"
       >sollicitous</hi> to deserve"<ref target="f011.20.08" n="8"><hi rend="super"
      >8</hi></ref>&mdash;are somewhat similar to the opening of the first sentence in the notice;
      and that (3) the text of the <pb n="011.255"/> "preliminary address" itself appeared in the
      three numbers of the <hi rend="italic">Chronicle</hi> for January 26-February 2, February 2-9,
      and February 9-16, 1760.<ref target="f011.20.09" n="9"><hi rend="super">9</hi></ref> On the
      other hand, of course, acceptance of the attribution of the notice lends additional weight to
      Mr. McAdam's suggestion regarding the authorship of the "preliminary address."</p>

     <head/>
     <p>In a paper published in 1944 Mr. Douglas Knight announced the discovery, in a full set of
      unbound numbers of Goldsmith's <hi rend="italic">Bee</hi> at Yale, of an unnoticed edition of
      No. I, with numerous differences from the edition in all bound sets he had seen or found
      described.<ref target="f011.21.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref> The two editions of
      No. I may be easily distinguished by their press figures. <list>
       <item>A.: 2-4, 13-1, 20-4, 27-3</item>

       <item>B. (the edition described by Mr. Knight): 2-2, 31-1</item>
      </list> Mr. Knight argued for the priority of B. chiefly on the basis of the less satisfactory
      punctuation in A., which he thought might be expected in a hasty reprint. In a brief comment
      on his paper at the time, I suggested that a better argument for the priority of B. could be
      found in its supposed rarity: if A. was the first edition and there were enough copies of it
      on hand to complete all or most sets when the weekly numbers were collected for re-issue, then
      it would not be possible to find a good reason why B. should have been printed at all; if,
      however, B. was the first edition, it would be easy to suggest plausible reasons why it might
      have been wholly or largely exhausted before the parts were collected.<ref
       target="f011.21.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref></p>



     <p>This argument for the priority of B. appeared to me conclusive; but when I came to examine
      the texts of the two editions, I found differences that from my experience with other
      Goldsmith texts I could account for only if A. were the first edition and B. the reprint. I
      consequently made a census of readily available copies of the <hi rend="italic">Bee</hi> and
      found that the B. edition is by no means excessively rare. In thirteen bound sets that I have
      seen or that have been described for me, No. I is in the A. edition in seven and in the B.
      edition in six.<ref target="f011.21.03" n="3"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref> Since my original
      argument thus loses all its force, I wish now to present the evidence that led me to question
      it.</p>


     <pb n="011.256"/>

     <p>As Mr. Knight has noticed, the chief textual differences in the two editions occur in the
      punctuation: "In every case the alteration makes the sense less clear [in A. than in B.], and
      in some places quite confuses it." There are two places where the punctuation is clearly in
      error in A. but correct in B. (Mr. Knight quotes one example from pages 18-19, and there is
      another on page 29); and according to the principle of textual degeneration in reprints, this
      evidence would point to B. as the first edition.<ref target="f011.21.04" n="4"><hi
        rend="super">4</hi></ref> But though experience has shown this principle to be sound for
      works of an earlier period, I doubt that it can be safely applied to printing of the third
      quarter of the eighteenth century. My observation is that compositors of authorized reprints
      in this period were remarkably accurate: they usually corrected at least as many obvious
      misprints as they made, and they introduced on an average&mdash;according to my experience
      with editions not revised by the author&mdash;only one substantive change every five or ten or
      even twenty pages. If great textual degeneration appears in a reprint in Goldsmith's day, one
      may well suspect a piracy.</p>


     <p>Some compositors of authorized reprints of the period were also very faithful to the
      punctuation of their copy, but many&mdash;probably most&mdash;compositors felt free to make
      what changes they thought desirable in the punctuation. And from collating thousands of pages
      of Goldsmith's writings, in periodicals and books printed for a variety of booksellers and in
      editions revised and unrevised by the author, I have found a consistent direction in these
      changes when they occur with at least a fair degree of frequency: <hi rend="italic">in
       reprints the punctuation becomes heavier and more regular</hi>. In the first printings of
      Goldsmith's writings the punctuation tends to be fairly light and somewhat irregular or
      inconsistent. In most first reprints commas and sometimes other marks of punctuation are
      added, and commas may be changed to semicolons, semicolons to colons, and periods to marks of
      exclamation or interrogation;<ref target="f011.21.05" n="5"><hi rend="super">5</hi></ref>
      punctuation tends to be omitted or lightened only to produce greater regularity. These same
      changes may <pb n="011.257"/> occur, though usually with decreasing frequency, in succeeding
       reprints.<ref target="f011.21.06" n="6"><hi rend="super">6</hi></ref>
     </p>



     <p>When this rule for identifying reprints is applied to No. I of the <hi rend="italic"
       >Bee</hi>, A. appears clearly as the first edition and B. as the reprint. In twelve places
      where there is no punctuation in A. there are commas in B., and in most of these places the
      punctuation thus appears more regular in B.: for example, where A. reads, "The sagacity of the
      physician, by this means soon discovered the cause of their patient's disorder; and Alcander
      being apprized of their discovery, at length extorted a confession from the reluctant dying
      lover" (p. 17), B. has commas after "means" and "Alcander." Again, in one place where there is
      no punctuation in A. there is a semicolon in B., and in four places where there are periods in
      A. there are exclamation marks in B. In all, then, the punctuation is heavier in B. than in A.
      in seventeen instances.<ref target="f011.21.07" n="7"><hi rend="super">7</hi></ref> On the
      other hand, there are only four instances in which the punctuation is heavier in A. than in
      B.: in three there are commas in A. where there is no punctuation in B., and in one there is a
      semicolon in A. where there is a comma in B. In three of these four instances the punctuation
      again appears to be more regular in B.: where A. reads, ". . . there is hardly a character in
      comedy to which a player of any real humour, might not add strokes of vivacity" (p. 12), B.
      omits the comma; where A. reads, ". . . the imperious tone, menaces, and blows at once changed
      their sensations and their ideas: their ears, and their shoulders taught their souls to shrink
      back into servitude" (p. 29), B. omits the comma after "ears"; where A. reads, "Thus lowering
      with resolution; he was dragged . . . before the tribunal" (p. 20), B. has a comma for the
      semicolon.</p>


     <p>This test seems to me to establish the priority of A., and my conclusion is supported or at
      least not weakened by other textual and bibliographical evidence.</p>

     <p><hi rend="italic">Substantive changes</hi>. There are only two substantive changes between
      A. and B. A. reads (with a correction of punctuation): ". . . every morning waked him to a
      renewal of famine or toil" (p. 19); the "a" is omitted in B. Here the readings seem equally
      satisfactory. The other change, however, would seem more important. A reads: "The French
      player . . . begins to shew away by talking nonsense, which he would have thought latin by
      those whom he knows do not understand a syllable of the matter" (p. 12); for "whom" B. reads
      "who". Since "who" would probably have been considered preferable by eighteenth-century
      standards, and since Goldsmith seems to have paid some attention to the distinction between
      "who" and "whom," it might seem probable that the B. reading was Goldsmith's and the A.
      reading was introduced by the compositor in a reprint. A parallel example, however, suggests
      that it is equally plausible that Goldsmith wrote <pb n="011.258"/> "whom" and that the
      compositor of B. was responsible for the "correction." In the Preface written for <hi
       rend="italic">Essays by Mr. Goldsmith</hi> (1765), Goldsmith says: "I would desire in this
      case, to imitate that fat man who I have somewhere heard of in a shipwreck"; and in revising
      this sentence for the second edition (1766) he left the "who" unchanged. But in a 1765 reprint
      of the <hi rend="italic">Essays</hi>, which there is no reason to think that Goldsmith revised
      and which is in all probability a piracy,<ref target="f011.21.08" n="8"><hi rend="super"
        >8</hi></ref> the "who" is changed to "whom".</p>


     <p><hi rend="italic">Copy for reprinting</hi>. It seems that Goldsmith would have been somewhat
      more likely to preserve for his own use copies of the first edition of No. I than copies of
      the reprint. In reprinting two essays from No. I in <hi rend="italic">Essays by Mr.
       Goldsmith</hi>, he used edition A. as copy.</p>

     <p><hi rend="italic">Factotum</hi>. When a work forming part of a series exists in two
      editions, the edition resembling other members of the series is probably the first edition.
      Edition A. of No. I and Nos. II-VIII all use the same factotum; Edition B. of No. I uses a
      different factotum. This argument loses some of its force, however, from the fact that the
      collected issue of the <hi rend="italic">Bee</hi> was published only three weeks after the
      appearance of No. VIII. Thus if the reprint of No. I was made for the collection, it could be
      considered not an exception to but the last member of the series and would be about as likely
      to resemble the rest of the series as would the first member.</p>

     <p><hi rend="italic">Press work</hi>. If the <hi rend="italic">Bee</hi> is thus thought of as a
      series of nine parts of which the first edition of No. I is the first part and the reprint of
      No. I the last, then we would expect the press work of the first edition to resemble that of
      the early part of the series, while the press work of the reprint would be more likely to
      resemble that of the latter part. The early part of the series, starting with No. II and
      continuing through the first gathering of No. V, shows almost perfect uniformity in the press
      work: with only one exception,<ref target="f011.21.09" n="9"><hi rend="super">9</hi></ref>
      each gathering has two press figures, and consequently one pressman must have printed on white
      paper and another pressman perfected each sheet, no doubt on a second press. Clearly edition
      A. of No. I corresponds to this part of the series, for it too has two press figures in each
      gathering. The latter part of the series shows less regularity in press figures: the second
      gathering of No. V has none; No. VI has one in each gathering; No. VII has two in the first
      gathering and none in the second; No. VIII has one in each gathering. The B. edition of No. I,
      with one press figure in each gathering, appears to correspond in its press work to Nos. VI
      and VIII, where presumably one pressman worked off both formes of a sheet on a single
      press.</p>


     <p><hi rend="italic">Wrappers</hi>. The original weekly numbers of the <hi rend="italic"
       >Bee</hi> were sold, according to the advertisements, "stitched in blue Covers." Thus some
      copies of the first edition of No. I had wrappers, while it is doubtful that any copies of the
      reprint did; and if a copy could be found in the original wrappers, <pb n="011.259"/> there is
      a fair presumption that it would belong to the first edition. The unbound numbers at Yale do
      not have wrappers, but Mr. Knight believes that they once had: "Although the wrappers have
      been lost, holes for the six original stitches can still be seen." It seems more probable,
      however, that the holes were made when the numbers were sewn for binding, for Mr. Herman
      Liebert informs me that in his opinion and that of other bibliographers at Yale the numbers
      there "have at one time been in, and have been very neatly removed from, some kind of
      binding."</p>

       would pay the publisher to make it more correct. But if he needed it for a limited purpose,
       and in a hurry, some compositor would have the responsibility of duplicating the earlier
       text." It is hard to see that haste would be involved here: three weeks elapsed between the
       appearance of the last weekly number on 24 November 1759 and the publication of the collected
       issue on 15 December; and it now appears that Wilkie must have had enough copies of the first

    <div2  id="vol011.22.01" type="section" n="1">
     <head/>
     <p>Five years after the colonies declared their independence, the Connecticut Assembly passed
      the first copyright legislation&mdash;an act granting Andrew Law protection in the publication
      of his <hi rend="italic">Collection of the Best Tunes for the Promotion of Psalmody</hi>. Two
      years later, as a result of John Ledyard's petition for the protection of his account of
      Captain James Cook's last voyage, the Connecticut Assembly passed the first general copyright
      act, the text of which was based upon the English "Act for the Encouragement of Learning."
      Soon after Connecticut, other states passed similar laws and by 1786 twelve states had given
      protection to their authors.</p>

     <p>It would seem, therefore, that the American author awaited freedom from English rule before
      pressing for protective legislation. Although this may be considered true for the great
      majority of American writers, there is at least one instance of an attempt to secure copyright
      before the Revolution.</p>

     <p>In 1770, William Billings, of Boston, published his <hi rend="italic">New-England
       Psalm-Singer</hi>, a book of tunes which he composed during his years as singing teacher and
      choir master. It was evidently a popular work, for Billings immediately started to prepare a
      second volume. While engaged in this enterprise, he probably feared the prospect of a pirated
      edition. At any rate, he decided to address a petition for protection to the House of
      Representatives, then in session at Harvard College. The petition has been lost, but it was
      duly recorded on November 7, 1770: <q>A Petition of <hi rend="italic">William Billings</hi>,
       praying that he may have the exclusive Privilege of selling a Book of Church-Musick, compos'd
       by himself, for a certain Term of Years.</q>
      <q>Read and committed to Mr. <hi rend="italic">Gardner</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Stow</hi>,
       Col. <hi rend="italic">Prescott</hi> and Capt. <hi rend="italic">Dix</hi>.<ref
        target="f011.22.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref></q></p>


     <pb n="011.260"/>

     <p>On November 13, 1770: <q>The Committee on the Petition of <hi rend="italic">William
        Billings</hi>, reported.</q>
      <q><hi rend="italic">Ordered</hi>, That the Petitioner have Leave to bring in a Bill for the
       Purpose of his Petition.<ref target="f011.22.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref></q></p>


     <p>Encouraged by this, Billings lost no time in preparing a bill. It was brought before the
      House on November 16, 1770: <q>A Bill <hi rend="italic">for granting to</hi> William Billings
        <hi rend="italic">the sole Privilege of Printing and Vending a Work of his own Composition,
        consisting of Tunes and Anthems suitable to be used in Religious Assemblies</hi>.</q>
      <q>Read the first and second Time. <hi rend="italic">Ordered</hi>, That the further
       Consideration of this Bill be referred to the next Session.<ref target="f011.22.03" n="3"
         ><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref>
      </q></p>


     <p>Although the House postponed the decision, it did not do so because of any doubt concerning
      the principle of granting copyright. The reason for the delay is stated in Billings' next
      petition, now printed from the manuscript: <q>Province of y<hi rend="super">e</hi> Mass:<hi
        rend="super">tts</hi> Bay</q></p>

     <p>The Memorial of Will:<hi rend="super">m</hi> Billings, &amp;c.</p>

     <p>Whereas your Memorialist in the Year 1770 prefer'd his Petition to this Hon:<hi rend="super"
       >ble</hi> Court, therein praying for the Reasons therein mention'd, that he might have a
      Patent granted him for the sole Liberty of printing a Book, by him compos'd, consisting of
      Psalm Tunes, Anthems &amp; Canons, which has been found upon Experience, to be to general
      Acceptance; &amp; which Composition is made much Use of in many of our Churches, &amp; is more
      &amp; more used every Day.</p>

     <p>That your Memorialist has compos'd a 2:<hi rend="super">d</hi> Vol: in Addition, to make his
      Performance more compleat, tho' he is not insensible, that further Additions may be
      made.&mdash;He would also inform this Hon:<hi rend="super">bl</hi> Court that he is
      apprehensive that an unfair Advantage is about to be taken against him, &amp; that others are
      endeavoring to reap the Fruits of his great Labor &amp; Cost.&mdash;That this hon:<hi
       rend="super">bl</hi> Court so far countenanc'd &amp; sustain'd his Petition, as to commit the
      same, &amp; that your Committee reported in favor of your Petitioner; but it being suggested
      by a worthy Member of this hon:<hi rend="super">ble</hi> Court, that they should be certain
      that your Petitioner was the real Author of the Book, whereupon the Consideration thereof was
      refer'd to the next Session. In answer to which your Memorialist avers that he is the sole
      Author, &amp; should have been asham'd, to have expos'd himself, by publishing any <pb
       n="011.261"/> Tunes, Anthems, or Canons, compos'd by Another; however fully to satisfy this
       hon:<hi rend="super">ble</hi> Court, your Memorialist stands very ready to be examin'd by any
      Committee, or the whole General Assembly, if they think proper; tho' he doubts not, that at
      this Time of Day there are sundry Members of this hon:<hi rend="super">ble</hi> Court upon
      that Head fully satisfy'd; but so it is may it please your Excellency &amp; Honors, that your
      Memorialist's former Petition is (as he is inform'd) either lost or misplac'd; he therefore
      prays that the same may be reviv'd, &amp; that he may, by the Indulgence of this Hon:<hi
       rend="super">bl</hi> Court, be favor'd with the alone Privilege, of printing his own
      Composition for a number of Years, as to this Hon:<hi rend="super">ble</hi> Court shall seem
      meet, &amp; your Memorialist, as in Duty Bound, shall ever pray.</p>

     <p>W<hi rend="super">m</hi> Billings.<ref target="f011.22.04" n="4"><hi rend="super"
       >4</hi></ref><lb/> Thus it appears that, in 1770, the House would have been willing to pass
      the copyright bill if they had been certain that the work was original. When Billings' second
      petition was received on June 9, 1772, it was "Read and <hi rend="italic">Ordered</hi>, That
      the Prayer be granted, and that the Petitioner have Leave to bring in a Bill."<ref
       target="f011.22.05" n="5"><hi rend="super">5</hi></ref> Fortunately, the manuscript of the
      bill remains in the <hi rend="italic">Massachusetts Archives</hi>: </p>
     <q><p>Anno Regni Regis Georgii tertii duodecimo</p>
      <p>An Act for Granting to William Billings of Boston the Sole privilege of printing and
       vending a Book by him Composed consisting of a Great variety of Psalm-tunes Anthems &amp;
       Canons in two Vol<hi rend="super">s</hi>.</p>
      <p>Whereas the s<hi rend="super">d</hi>. W<hi rend="super">m</hi>. Billings has compos'd a
       Great Number of psalm-tunes Anthems and Canons to which are much us'd in and esteemed by many
       of our Churches, and which are daily more and more us'd and adopted by a Great number of
       people&mdash;which Composition has cost him much pains and application and has also been very
       expensive to him;&mdash;And whereas the said William Billings has supplicated the aid of this
       Court in this his undertaking&mdash;in Order therefore to promote such a laudable
       performance</p></q>



     <p>Be it enacted by the Governour Council &amp; House of Representatives&mdash; That the said
      William Billings be and hereby is impower'd soley to print and vend his said Composition
      consisting of Psalm-tunes Anthems and Canons and have and recieve (<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>)
      the whole and only benefit and emolument arising therefrom for and during the full term of
      seven [fourteen (<hi rend="italic">deleted</hi>)] years from the first Day of August next
      during which term all persons are hereby strictly prohibited either by himself or any by for
      or under him, from printing or vending his P. Composition either in whole or in part, and that

      barter the same either in whole or in part as afores<hi rend="super">d</hi>. he she or they so

      Ten pounds 0:0 for each and every offence and so <pb n="011.262"/> toties quoties; to be
      recover'd by the said W<hi rend="super">m</hi>. Billings to and for his use in any Court of
      Record proper to try the same <hi rend="italic">unless</hi> the Person or Persons so printing
      vending or bartering his said Composition shall be first impower'd by the said William
      Billings in writing under his hand &amp; seal.</p>

     <p>In the House of Representatives July. 14. 1772<lb/> Read a first second &amp; third time
      &amp; pass'd to be Engrossed<lb/> Sent up for Concurrence<lb/> T. Cushing Spkr<lb/> In

      Engrossed<lb/> Jn. Cotton D.Secry.<ref target="f011.22.06" n="6"><hi rend="super"
      >6</hi></ref></p>


     <p>In reading the text of this bill, one cannot help wondering what motives prompted the change
      in the term of copyright. The English law, the Statute of Queen Anne, permitted a copyright of
      fourteen years for new books. And when, on May 2, 1783, the Colonial Congress recommended the
      passage of copyright laws by the several States, it suggested a term of not less than fourteen
      years. Perhaps the House of Representatives thought a term of seven years would appear to be a
      fair compromise.</p>

     <p>As the Speaker's endorsement shows, the bill was passed by the House on June 14, 1772.<ref
       target="f011.22.07" n="7"><hi rend="super">7</hi></ref> The Council passed it, too, but
      Hutchinson refused to sign it. It was returned to the House along with other bills and the
      statement that "his Excellency had not given his Assent to the following Bills which had been
      laid before him."<ref target="f011.22.08" n="8"><hi rend="super">8</hi></ref></p>



     <p>Billings must have been discouraged, for his second book was not published until 1778. He
      had not obtained the copyright for his proposed two-volume work; but this episode is
      significant because a colonial legislative body had passed a bill for copyright, even though
      it was vetoed by the representative of the Crown.</p>

     <head/>
     <p>For students of modern bibliography Sinclair Lewis's <hi rend="italic">Babbitt</hi> offers
      worthwhile evidence about textual variation, and its problems, in present day printing from
      plates. The facts of variation are in themselves of no particular literary significance (save
      that they occur); but the implications that can be drawn from a study of <hi rend="italic"
       >Babbitt</hi>'s printing history as revealed by these facts are of real moment to critics of
      contemporary texts and to scholars who must quote from texts produced by 20th-century printing
      shops. Of more specialized interest is the appearance of two bibliographical problems, for one
      of which, at least, no certain solution is available.</p>

     <p>The variants in question appear in a table at the end of this note. They were discovered by
      examining copies of different printings on the Hinman Collating Machine owned by the
      University of Virginia Library.<ref target="f011.23.01" n="1"><hi rend="super"
      >1</hi></ref></p>


     <p>In all, five states of variation may be found between the original state of the plates and
      the state represented by current reprints in the Modern Library and Harbrace Modern Classics
      editions (both printed from the same plates). The first stage of correction occurs during the
      initial printing published on September 14, 1922, by Harcourt, Brace &amp; Co. Here the
      substitution of <hi rend="italic">Lyte</hi> for <hi rend="italic">Purdy</hi>, and of <hi
       rend="italic">any</hi> for <hi rend="italic">my</hi> on page 49 is of some seriousness since
      the original reading had misnamed the character. The problem is in two parts, of course: (1)
      to determine whether the error was corrected by stop press or by cancellation within a single
      impression, or whether the error was confined to the whole first impression, and the corrected
      state of page 49 to a different impression of the book; and (2) who caught the error and when,
      and how it was corrected.</p>

     <p>Because stop-press alteration of plates is expensive in lost press-time when undertaken by
      modern printing establishments, absolutely attested cases have not, apparently, found their
      way into published bibliographical investigation. Hence one's first impulse might be to
      conjecture that there were two pre-publication printings of <hi rend="italic">Babbitt</hi> and
      that the changes on page 49 were made between the two impressions. There were indeed two
      prepublication printings. The Harcourt, Brace records<ref target="f011.23.02" n="2"><hi
        rend="super">2</hi></ref> show that the first <pb n="011.264"/> printing bill for 80,500
      copies of <hi rend="italic">Babbitt</hi> was dated July 27, 1922; and the second press bill
      for 20,000 copies September 23, 1922. The first plate correction bill was September 23, 1922.
      Since publication date was September 14, it is clear that the second impression had been
      ordered before publication and may even have been run off the presses by that date although
      (see below) not released until October.</p>


     <p>However, this impression can be identified, and it is not the same as the impression in
      which the only variants are those on page 49, for in this second printing the Hinman Collator
      discloses some evidence of slight plate damage that would occur through storage of plates
      between impressions. Moreover, additional plate corrections were made, on pages 75, 85, and
      271, not present in the various copies containing only the page 49 altered readings. Doubtless
      because the order for the second printing of 20,000 copies was placed before publication as a
      supplement to the original printing, no change from the first-impression date was made on the
      verso of the title-page for these copies; hence they can be distinguished from first-printing
      copies only by the presence of the corrected readings on pages 75, 85, and 271. However, on
      the title-page verso of the third impression this second printing is given belated recognition
      as <hi rend="italic">Second Printing, October, 1922</hi>, followed by the line <hi
       rend="italic">Third Printing, October, 1922</hi>.<ref target="f011.23.03" n="3"><hi
        rend="super">3</hi></ref></p>


     <p>To sum up. The publisher's records list between the first and third printings a second of
      20,000 billed on September 23, 1922. By some slight plate damage and by alterations to the
      plates of pages 75, 85, and 271 (accounting for the September 23 bill for plate corrections)
      this impression differentiates itself from the impression with the original states of the
      plates and (on the evidence of the Hinman Collator in the lack of plate damage) from the same
      first impression though with the two alterations on page 49. This second printing is
      subsequently numerated on the title-page verso of the third and fourth impressions, although
      not on its own title-page verso. The <hi rend="italic">Lyte-any</hi> variants on page 49,
      therefore, were not made in the interval between two impressions but instead are present
      within the original first impression.</p>

     <p>As to the exact circumstances of these page 49 alterations within the first printing we have
      no information and at this late date are unlikely to secure any. On some occasions a modern
      pressman at the start of printing will scan an early copy of a sheet for mechanical errors;
      but that such a workman would be so intimately concerned with the sense as to catch the
      mistake in a name, as here, is scarcely credible. It would be possible to conceive on other
      occasions that delay in the delivery of author's corrected <pb n="011.265"/> proof for final
      revises, or some error in failing to make final corrections, might inadvertently extend even
      to the early stages of printing. No precise decision seems possible here, although conjecture
      may be allowed. It would seem most probable that by some accident, the details of which cannot
      be recovered, these two page 49 corrections ordered for the text in linotype form had not been
      made before casting of the plate; and the failure to correct was then discovering by
      comparison of such proof with the foundry proof (pulled from the plates) only after printing
      of the forme had started. We know that Lewis had partly relied upon the professional
      proofreaders in the Quinn &amp; Boden printing establishment. Hence, as an alternative theory
      we might guess that someone, perhaps interested in the story, took it upon himself to read the
      whole collection of foundry proofs and in this process came upon the page 49 errors.<ref
       target="f011.23.04" n="4"><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref></p>


     <p>Thus we are faced with the simple proposition, either (1) the case is one of stop-press
      correction, or (2) the case is one of sheet cancellation. That the <hi rend="italic"
       >Lyte-any</hi> sheets of the first printing represent completely reimposed and newly
      imprinted sheets at a later time is possible but not probable on the evidence. If a cancellans
      sheet had been manufactured before binding had started, the <hi rend="italic">Purdy-my</hi>
      sheets would need to represent faulty copies which had been ordered destroyed but by some
      error found their way to the bindery along with corrected sheets. Such a theory cannot be
      maintained in view of the evidence that substantial numbers of the original state are in
      existence (6 of the original against 8 of the corrected in the 14 copies I have checked).</p>

     <p>As an alternative we should need to suppose that binding had started before the error was
      discovered and the cancellans sheets provided; in such a case the <hi rend="italic"
       >Purdy-my</hi> copies would represent copies initially bound before the cancellans sheets
      arrived. There is no positive evidence for this theory, and some rather slight evidence
      against it. In the first place, no records of a cancellans sheet exist. In the second, I am
      inclined to lean some weight on the fact that at the time the alterations were made in the
      original set of plates, a duplicate set of shells (unbacked plates) that had also been cast
      were similarly altered. The argument is not strong, but on the evidence that later plate
      alterations were not (except for two anomalous pages) simultaneously transferred to the
      shells, there may be reason to associate the page 49 corrections as near as possible to the
      original casting and checking of both original plate and shell, since changes made in the one
      seem to have been made simultaneously in the other. The odds are, therefore, that in the page
      49 variants we have an example of comparatively rare modern stoppress correction.<ref
       target="f011.23.05" n="5"><hi rend="super">5</hi></ref></p>


     <pb n="011.266"/>

     <p>In the unnumbered second printing (not distinguished from the first but subsequently listed
      as the second, and as distributed in October), the page 49 alterations are found, of course,
      and in addition errors on pages 75, 85, and 271 were corrected in the plates; and in the
      numbered third printing (October) a further necessary change was made, on page 397, from <hi
       rend="italic">against the Open Shop</hi> to <hi rend="italic">for the Open Shop</hi>. In
      large part as the result of Mr. Louis Feipel's suggestion,<ref target="f011.23.06" n="6"><hi
        rend="super">6</hi></ref> twelve further corrections were made in the fourth printing
      distributed in November of the same year. This state of the plates also machined the Grosset
      &amp; Dunlap movie reprint edition of 1924.</p>


     <p>An immediate anomaly appears when the series of printings are collated as represented by the
      Harbrace Modern Classics, post-1942 cheap edition Grosset &amp; Dunlap editions, and the
      Modern Library reprints, for with the exception of the two corrections on page 49 stemming
      from the plate alteration to this single page during the first impression, and the variants on
      pages 188 and 196 first found in the fourth printing, the remaining fourteen alterations
      revert to their original faulty readings as present in the first-impression plates. Duplicate
      plates provide the explanation. The Harcourt, Brace &amp; Co. records show that on July 1,
      1922, one set of plates and a duplicate set of shells (unbacked plates) were manufactured
      (information <pb n="011.267"/> again by the courtesy of Mr. Gerald Gross). On December 20,
      1941, the original set of plates was melted, and on January 7, 1942, the duplicates, or
      shells, were backed up to make them into printing plates. From this second set, therefore,
      were printed all the Harbrace Modern Classics and Modern Library editions.</p>

     <p>That page 49 in these duplicate plates appears in the corrected state is explicable in the
      normal course provided the stop-press alterations were made from foundry proof and thus in
      both sets at the same time, plates and shells. However, the seemingly arbitrary selection only
      of pages 188 and 196 to bring into conformity with the first-set alterations in the fourth
      impression is very puzzling. Both pages are in the outer forme of the same sheet, but the
      significance of this fact is difficult to apply.<ref target="f011.23.07" n="7"><hi
        rend="super">7</hi></ref></p>


     <p>From this history of the plates we learn that the Lewis who sneered at an English Rotarian
      for speaking of "Bertrand Shaw" was not himself so scrupulous as he might have been about the
      accuracy of his references to the fraternal organizations that he was satirizing. The <hi
       rend="italic">B.</hi> in <hi rend="italic">B. P. O. E.</hi> he twice expanded in error as <hi
       rend="italic">Brotherly</hi> (pp. 9, 165, corrected in the fourth printing) although once
      correctly as <hi rend="italic">Benevolent</hi> (p. 55). The forms <hi rend="italic"
       >Oddfellows</hi> (p. 203) and <hi rend="italic">Redmen</hi> (p. 188 but correctly on p. 203)
      might seem as ignorant to members of these orders as "Bertrand" Shaw to a literary man.</p>

     <p>But the really interesting conclusion from this plate study, outside of the two
      bibliographical problems involved, is the evidence that in modern textual transmission one
      cannot necessarily trust the latest editions of plated books to be the most correct. Before
      the institution of the duplicate plates the history of <hi rend="italic">Babbitt</hi> was one
      of steady improvement in the state of the text through the fourth printing, although no
      evidence is present to suggest authorial correction at any stage. But beginning with 1942
      editions, the almost wholly uncorrected second set of plates reverted to a state of textual
      error that wiped out substantially all the results of the improvements in the second, third,
      and fourth impressions. As a result, the only reading texts now being printed are more corrupt
      than any impression after the original; and a textual critic of the future will need to search
      out either the fourth impression or some reprint before 1942 since only these represent the
      most highly corrected state of <hi rend="italic">Babbitt</hi>'s readings.<ref

       arguments of the bookseller Robert K. Black that since the <hi rend="italic">Lyte-any</hi>
       readings are found in a copy autographed by Lewis on the day after publication (the copy is
       now in the University of Virginia Library), they must represent the state found in the
       author's advance copies and thus must be considered as "gathered and bound before any of the
       so-called 'first state' copies, so that in terms of priority of issue, though not of
       printing, it actually precedes them and is therefore more desirable" (see Mr. Black's <hi
        rend="italic">List Number Forty-Five</hi> issued <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> March 1956 from
       Upper Montclair, N.J.). In the first place, the copy cannot be proved to be from the advance
       copies sent Lewis. In the second place, the assumption that an author's advance copies
       represent the first copies off the binding machines is ordinarily wrong: it supposes that
       copies are shipped to the publisher in driblets from the bindery and that the publisher
       immediately breaks open a case and sends out the author's copies. In the third place, the
       order of pre-publication distribution of copies can have no bearing on questions of 'issue,'
       especially when mere press variants are involved. For a full discussion of this matter, see

       errors and inconsistencies, wrote Harcourt, Brace on November 6, 1922, enclosing a list of

       because of real error. In response to the question whether the spelling <hi rend="italic"

       acknowledging on November 9 Mr. Feipel's list, replied that the spelling was intentional, and
       added, "It may interest you to know that it was an effort, each time the proof was read, to
       keep the proof reader from changing it." Lewis's response to the list was in character: "J.
       Henry! This man Feipel is a wonder &mdash; to catch all these after rather unusually careful
       proofreading not only by myself and my wife but also by two or three professionals at
