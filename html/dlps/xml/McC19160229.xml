            <salute>Dear Marcelle:</salute>
        		</opener>
        		
            <p>
            There are so many
            orders coming through daily
            that I do not know where
            I shall end up.  First off
            it was decreed that Americans
            should be perfectioned at Belleville
            where Kiffin, Thaw, etc. are at 
            present, and then that all
            should be perfectioned on Caudrons.
            Today it has been ordained
            that Americans should train
            as well as be perfectioned on
            Caudrons so as to supply the 
            heavy machines needed for 
            the American escadrille.  So
            far I’ve dodged them and am
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0247" n="[p.2]"/>
            
            going ahead on the Nieufort
            with which I am doing well.
            If they try to change me
            I shall tell them I lied
            on enlisting and am really
            French, and if that doesn’t
            work and they put me on
            a Caudron I will break one
            machine after another.  Then I 
            will be put in jail and
            I’ll stay there until I have
            my way if its five years.
            Thaw, Cowden, &amp; Prince have
            been put on Nieuforts and
            now that they have good
            machines they are fixing it
            so we’ll get the needed but
            rotten ones.  I was sent to
            the Nieufort not because I
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0246" n="[p.3]"/>
            
            was unfortunate enough to
            be born an American but
            on account of my record.
            Having earned the right
            to an avion de chasse I’m
            not going to give it up.
            I’m the only American here
            that was sent to the Nieufort.
            By the way I told you didn’t
            I that I have to wait here
            before going to the front
            and do not have the
            Belleville school to pass?
            Sorry, as I won’t have
            much time.  I go to Le Bourget
            where is the General Reserve
            and then to the front.
            </p><p>
            I suppose you are
            working very hard now
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0248" n="[p.4]"/>
            
            on account of the Verdun
            attack.  But please don’t
            overwork yourself Marcelle.
            </p><p>
            Mrs. Slade wrote me
            a very fine letter.  I do not
            see how she could have
            been so nice about it all.
            She really was splendid.
            I will always be grateful to
            her.
            </p><p>
            Because some of the officers
            here got soused and tore up
            Pau it is forbidden every 
            one of us to go there.  I
            do not know what the men
            will do who have been in
            the habit of going there.
            As for myself I don’t care a
            rap.  Hope to be out soon 
            anyway.  
            </p>
