            <p>
            We’ve had nothing
            but rotten weather and its
            holding us all back.  Even
            with good weather I’ll be 
            here longer that expected, for
            a new rule anent perfectionment
            has gone into effect, making
            our training much longer.
            Then again we have to be
            proficient in firing and we
            have target practice every day.
            Later we’ll shoot with a 
            mitrailleuse.  Outside of
            the above there is no news.
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0251" n="[p.2]"/>
            
            Mrs. <unclear>Gidlestone [sp?]</unclear> wrote me a
            very nice letter.  I begin
            to feel very much better,
            tho [sic] I’m just as much
            ashamed of myself as
            ever.
            </p><p>
            Some worry is felt 
            here about Rumsey, one 
            of the Americans.  He has
            disappeared for a week.
            I hope he hasn’t beat it.
            Too many Americans have
            deserted already, and if
            it continues we’ll all
            be under suspicion.  Two
            have landed in Germany
            and people believe that
            it was intentional.
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0250" n="[p.3]"/>
            
            I am going to make a 
            demand to be sent to
            Toul.  I know the country
            and the lines near there
            so well.  By the way my
            old section is at Verdun.
            </p><p>
            I will get the photos
            I promised you as soon
            as possible.  I’ve ordered
            the set but as Paul
            has same in charge the
            time is uncertain.
            </p><p>
            The day after I
            wrote you that I’m go to
            Le Bourget and not to
            Belleville, where the school
            is, the General Reserve was
            moved to the latter place,
            and so I will have to
                        
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0252" n="[p.4]"/>
            
            report there.
            </p><p>
            Will you please
            do me a favor?  The next
            time you send me a letter
            will you please drop me
            a card addressed as follows:
            <lb/>
            J.R. Mc Connell, Pilote Aviateur<lb/>
            Aviation Militaire<lb/>
            Bureau Central Militaire<lb/>
            Paris.<lb/>
            
            I want to see how quickly
            that permanent address works
            so as to instruct American
            correspondents how to address
            me no matter where I may
            be.  Sorry I can’t write
            more to night but lights
            are out.       
            </p>
