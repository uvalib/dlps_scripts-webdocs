<name type="title">English Publishing and the Mass Audience in
1852</name>
<lb/><hi rend="italic">by</hi><lb/> <name type="author">Richard D. Altick</name><ref target="f006.01.00" n="*"><hi rend="super">*</hi></ref>
</head>

<div2 type="section" n="1"><head></head>
<p>From the very beginnings of publishing as a profit-making
enterprise, the publisher's estimate of the size of a book's
potential audience, its willingness to pay the price he will ask,
and above all its current tastes, has been the major consideration
in his decision whether or not to send the manuscript on to the
type-setter. The whole history of literature in the past few
centuries is, in a sense, the aggregate history of such decisions.
But we know very little about how publishers of various periods
regarded their market. What was their conception of its numerical
size? of its social composition and educational level? of its
ability to pay the asking prices of books? of the manifold elements
in the cultural and social background of the age which influenced
the book-buying habit?</p>
<p>Today publishers have at their disposal the results of hundreds,
indeed thousands, of studies, made chiefly by library-science
students and market analysis specialists, of twentieth-century
reading habits and the conditions which influence them. The latest
results of this continuing survey are constantly drawn upon by the
publishers of mass-circulation periodicals and paper-bound books.
To that degree the contemporary reading public, as delineated by
modern techniques of opinion- and behavior-sampling, exerts a
direct and relatively measurable influence upon what is published.
Elsewhere in the trade, it is true, that influence is less direct,
but it is still potent, for modern commercial publishers stake
their very existence, fully as much as do the makers of detergents
or deep-freeze units, upon an accurate estimate of the potential
market for their product and its current likes and dislikes.</p>
<p>When some future scholar sets out to assess the influence of the
audience upon what was published in our own age, he will have a
vast body

<pb n="006.004"/>

of information to work upon, make of it what he will. But the
present-day scholar who attempts to answer the same question for
the Victorian age must deal with two quantities which are still
largely unknown: <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> the true nature of the Victorian reading
public, and <hi rend="italic">y,</hi> the average publisher's conception of it and
the degree to which that conception influenced his editorial
decisions.</p>
<p>With <hi rend="italic">y</hi> we shall have little to do here, except to remark
that the evidence that comes down to us on the point is scanty.
Shrewd though some of the Victorian publishers were, few of them,
at least until the later decades of the century, seem to have
bothered very much about the reading public as a whole. Most of
them, with the conspicuous exception of the newcomers in the trade
who unabashedly angled for the pennies and shillings of the masses,
were untouched by the revolution that was going on about them. Such
ideas as they had about the new audience were clouded by
indifference, prejudice, and misinformation. The Victorians were
statistics-conscious, even statistics-mad; they had a passion for
collecting and codifying data on all sorts of other
subjects&mdash;education, sanitary conditions, crime, wages,
trade&mdash;but they seem never to have thought of making a thorough
study of the contemporary reading public and of the place of the
reading habit in the whole social scene.</p>
<p>In this paper our business is with <hi rend="italic">x</hi>. We are only
beginning to understand what the Victorian audience was really
like; only now are we beginning to subject to the test of original
research the facile assumptions that have been so long
current.<ref target="f006.01.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref> In the pages that follow,
I shall make a retrospective audience survey for an English
publisher of the year 1852. My purpose is not to measure the
publishers' actual awareness of the swiftly changing audience&mdash;a
task for which, as I say, our present knowledge is inadequate&mdash;but
to suggest how research, aided by the perspective of a hundred
years, allows us to see the mid-Victorian reading public as it
might have appeared to a publisher as market-conscious as his
modern counterpart.</p>
</div2>

<div2 type="section" n="2"><head></head>
<p>I have chosen the year 1852 not just because there is something
satisfactorily tidy in going back precisely a century. It was in
the fifties, I think, that the reading public could first be called
a mass public in anything like modern terms. Admittedly, people as
far back as Dr. Johnson's time had been exclaiming over the
increase in the number of readers, and

<pb n="006.005"/>

the March of Mind was one of the most publicized phenomena of the
period stretching from the 1820's to mid-century. But it was only
around the fifties that the familiar phrase of "literature for the
millions" ceased to be mere hyperbole and came to have a basis in
sober fact. The spread of elementary education had raised the
literacy rate. Popular interest in reading, generated initially by
the radical press of the Reform Bill and Chartist periods, had been
exploited by the proprietors of cheap sensational weekly
newspapers, men like Lloyd and Reynolds, who also produced enormous
quantities of melodramatic fiction in penny numbers&mdash;the famous
"penny bloods." On the more decorous side, the activities of the
religious denominations in spreading tracts and other edifying
reading-matter broadcast among the population encouraged the
reading habit.</p>
<p>It is significant that in this decade of the 1850's one finds
the first recurrent journalistic interest in the new mass market
for the printed word. In 1858, for example, Wilkie Collins wrote of
his discovery of "The Unknown Public" as dramatically as if he had
come upon the sources of the Nile.<ref target="f006.01.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref>
The mass audience for cheap periodicals he described had, as I have
suggested, been in existence for some years before he announced his
discovery of it; but the point is that it had by now become large
enough and important enough to constitute an interesting and
provocative subject for an article in the middle-class press, and
that Collins could tell the readers of <hi rend="italic">Household Words,</hi>
itself a twopenny periodical for the middle classes, that there had
come into being a much larger reading public lower down on the
social and cultural scale. This was the era when reading first
became genuinely democratized.</p>
<p>How large was the greatest possible audience to which a
publisher could appeal? By the census of 1851, the total population
of England, Scotland, and Wales above the age of twenty was eleven
and a half millions&mdash;an increase of more than four million adults
in thirty years.<ref target="f006.01.03" n="3"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref> Of these, 31% of
the males and 45% of the females were unable to sign their names to
the marriage register.<ref target="f006.01.04" n="4"><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref> A literacy
rate based upon this test is

<pb n="006.006"/>

not, of course, a reliable indication of the number who could
<hi rend="italic">read</hi>. Undoubtedly many men and women who could not sign
their names could nevertheless master simple reading-matter. On the
other hand, many who could scrawl their signatures, as a purely
mechanical accomplishment, could not read at all. The two
considerations may cancel each other out; in any case, evidence
from other sources suggests that while a literacy rate of somewhere
around 60% may be a bit low for the fifties, it is not too far off
the mark. We may, therefore, write off 40% of the total adult
population as not conceivably forming any market for printed
matter. In addition, we must eliminate the by no means
inconsiderable number of people who were on the sheer fringes of
literacy and who therefore would be no more likely to buy a book or
a paper than would their brethren who were in total darkness. On
the other hand, we should throw in perhaps a half-million youths
under twenty who might buy adult
reading-matter. All these calculations are so speculative that a
final figure is nothing more than a guess crowning a precarious
pile of other guesses, but for the sake of hanging up some sort of
goal for the ambitious Victorian publisher to strive for, let us
say that, omitting the market for juvenile literature and school
texts, the gross potential British reading public in 1852 was
between five and six million.</p>
<p>This optimum audience (to use a notably un-Victorian phrase) and
the practising one were, of course, very different things. The only
guide we have to the number of people who actually read in 1852 is
sales figures, and these must always be handled with caution. For
one thing, few of them are authentic beyond question; the great
majority come down to us as second-hand reports or as frank
guesses. For another, they include quantities of books exported to
the colonies and elsewhere. But since there is no way of knowing
what reduction should be made on this account, we shall have to
follow the usual practice, however mistaken it may be, and let
gross sales figures represent home consumption only. It must be
understood, therefore, that whatever statistical conclusions are
reached on this basis are bound to be on the liberal side.</p>
<p>In 1852 occurred one of those events which periodically, perhaps
every generation or so, give publishers and other students of the
contemporary literary scene a fresh glimpse of the farthest limits
of the reading audience. This was the amazing vogue of <hi rend="italic">Uncle
Tom's Cabin,</hi> the biggest sensation the English book trade had
ever known. In a single fortnight in October, 1852, at least ten
different editions came out, and Routledge alone was selling 10,000
copies a day. Some eighteen publishers climbed on the bandwagon;
within six months of publication, the book had sold 150,000 copies,
and within a year, according to one account, the total sales had
reached

<pb n="006.007"/>

a million and a half, a figure that includes both home and colonial
distribution.<ref target="f006.01.05" n="5"><hi rend="super">5</hi></ref></p>
<p>If we lop off an arbitrary fraction which represents export
sales, and in addition exercise a measure of scholarly
conservatism, we are still left with a figure of, say, a million
immediate buyers. But it is obvious that a great many of those who
purchased whatever edition of <hi rend="italic">Uncle Tom's Cabin</hi> was suited
to their particular purses seldom if ever bought any other book.
These scores, if not hundreds, of thousands of nonce-readers could
not by any stretch of the imagination be counted as part of a
dependable audience; the figure of a million purchasers represents
the ultimate extreme to which the book market could, on a very rare
occasion, expand.</p>
<p>The sales of less fantastic best-sellers of the period give us
a surer indication of the size to which the market could expand at
relatively more frequent intervals, the number of constant
book-buyers&mdash;the irreducible minimum in the publisher's
calculations&mdash;being swelled several times over by the interest of
those who buy only that occasional book which is all the talk.
<hi rend="italic">In Memoriam</hi> is said to have sold 60,000 copies within a
short time after its publication in 1850.
<ref target="f006.01.06" n="6"><hi rend="super">6</hi></ref> In 1852-53 Dickens' <hi rend="italic">Bleak
House,</hi>
appearing in shilling parts, soon reached 35,000 and climbed to
40,000 before publication was completed.
<ref target="f006.01.07" n="7"><hi rend="super">7</hi></ref> In 1855 the third and fourth
volumes of
Macaulay's <hi rend="italic">History of England</hi> sold 25,000 on the day of
publication alone.<ref target="f006.01.08" n="8"><hi rend="super">8</hi></ref> These figures
suggest that the short-term sale of a highly popular

<pb n="006.008"/>

book, at the original published price, could run as high as 50,000,
and within a very few years, as was the case with W. H. Russell's
two-volume account of the Crimean War, published in 1855-56, it
could go as high as 200,000.<ref target="f006.01.09" n="9"><hi rend="super">9</hi></ref>
Reckoning four or five readers per copy, that again gives us an
audience of, at the very most, a million&mdash;<hi rend="italic">for books only of the

very greatest immediate appeal</hi>. The <hi rend="italic">normal</hi>
book-buying
audience was, of course, infinitely smaller, probably somewhere in
the high tens of thousands; and of this number only a small
proportion could be expected to buy a given title except in the
case of a best-seller. For the ordinary book, an edition of from
500 to 1,000 copies sufficed.</p>
<p>We must remember, though, that there was, and is, an important
distinction between the book-buying public and the public which
reads books but does not buy them. In 1852 the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh
Review</hi> was remarking that although the demand for books had
"increased tenfold upon what it was seventy years ago," "few people
now buy books." The reason was, of course, that "the mass of the
reading world are supplied from the subscription-library or the
book-club."<ref target="f006.01.10" n="10"><hi rend="super">10</hi></ref> Hence multiplying the
number of copies sold by four or five to obtain the total number of
readers fails to take into account the larger number through whose
hands the circulating-library copies passed. Of the number
initially printed of Volumes III and IV of Macaulay's
<hi rend="italic">History,</hi> 2,400 copies went to Mudie's Library alone;
<ref target="f006.01.11" n="11"><hi rend="super">11</hi></ref> and in the decade beginning in
1853,
Mudie's were to buy a total of almost a million volumes.
<ref target="f006.01.12" n="12"><hi rend="super">12</hi></ref> Mr.
Mudie himself is said to have estimated that every book in his
library found "on an average, thirty readers&mdash;considerably more,
in the majority of instances, as regards novels, and considerably
less in the case of scientific and philosophical works."
<ref target="f006.01.13" n="13"><hi rend="super">13</hi></ref> So long, therefore, as a substantial

proportion of an edition was sold not to individual buyers but to
the libraries and to the more or less informal book clubs which
then abounded, especially in the provinces, the size of the actual
book-reading public could be but partially reflected by sales
figures.</p>
<p>Just as in our own day, the portion of the total reading public
which habitually bought periodicals was immensely larger than that
which bought books or borrowed them from the subscription
libraries. As the century began its second half, the most popular
periodicals were achieving

<pb n="006.009"/>

circulations that greatly surpassed the record set by the <hi rend="italic">Penny
Magazine,</hi> which had sold 200,000 for a brief time in the early
1830's.<ref target="f006.01.14" n="14"><hi rend="super">14</hi></ref> The <hi rend="italic">Family
Herald</hi>
was in process of more than doubling its circulation, from 125,000
in 1849 to 300,000 in 1855.<ref target="f006.01.15" n="15"><hi rend="super">15</hi></ref> The
<hi rend="italic">London Journal</hi> was approaching a circulation of 450,000,
and
<hi rend="italic">Reynolds' Miscellany</hi> 200,000.
<ref target="f006.01.16" n="16"><hi rend="super">16</hi></ref> <hi rend="italic">Chambers's Journal,</hi>
one of
the
earliest successful cheap periodicals, was selling between 60,000
and 70,000.<ref target="f006.01.17" n="17"><hi rend="super">17</hi></ref> In addition, there
were the threepenny weekly newspapers, which were sold both to the
readers of the mass-circulation periodicals and to a large class of
readers who looked at nothing else. The <hi rend="italic">Illustrated London
News</hi> sold 140,000 a week, while the <hi rend="italic">News of the
World</hi>
and <hi rend="italic">Lloyd's Weekly Newspaper</hi> each sold in the
neighborhood
of 110,000 copies, and several
other popular papers circulated between 40,000 and 75,000
weekly.<ref target="f006.01.18" n="18"><hi rend="super">18</hi></ref> It was on the basis of
such sales

<pb n="006.010"/>

figures as these, reckoning three readers to a copy, that Wilkie
Collins decided that the "unknown public"&mdash;the public unknown,
that is, to the book publishers, the public "which lies right out
of the pale of literary civilisation"&mdash;amounted to three million
persons.<ref target="f006.01.19" n="19"><hi rend="super">19</hi></ref> The estimate on the whole
is sound, and if anything, considering the size of the typical
Victorian family, conservative. All in all, there is no doubt
whatever that in the 1850's Britain had an audience for printed
matter immensely larger than it had ever known before.</p>

</div2>

<div2 type="section" n="3"><head></head>
<p>So much for the quantitative extent of the 1852 market. But what
of the economic considerations which play so vital a part in
consumer analysis? In 1852 books were not quite the luxury items
they had been for most of the century, but they were not, on the
other hand, as readily obtainable as the reformers wished. Three
years earlier one such friend of the people, the lecturer George
Dawson, had told a committee of Parliament, "The fact is, we give
the people in this country an appetite to read, and supply them
with nothing. For the last many years in England everybody has been
educating the people, but they have forgotten to find them any
books. In plain language, you have made them hungry, but you have
given them nothing to eat; it is almost a misfortune to a man to
have a great taste for reading, and not to have the power of
satisfying it."<ref target="f006.01.20" n="20"><hi rend="super">20</hi></ref> The circulation
figures I have just cited would seem to discredit Dawson so far as
cheap periodicals are
concerned, but on the score of books he was right. Original
editions were priced beyond the reach of all but the distinctly
prosperous. The sacrosanct three-decker novel held obstinately firm
at a guinea-and-a-half, and other types of newly published
literature were priced more or less to match. For the ordinary
London clerk, say, who was lucky to make the thirty bob a week of
which John Davidson was to sing later in the century, to buy a
newly published novel would have meant the sacrifice of a week's
salary. Some of the best novelists of the age, Dickens, Thackeray,
and Trollope, for instance, were bringing out their newest fictions
in monthly parts at a shilling apiece, and while this practice did
bring the total cost of a new novel down to, say, twenty shillings,
it still left the purchaser with the expense of binding up the
parts. Its principal advantage was that it spread the cost over a
year or two, thus making new novels available to the man who had
one shilling to spend
every month, but seldom twenty or thirty at a time.</p>


<pb n="006.011"/>

<p>However, many successful works of both fiction and non-fiction
were reprinted, within a few years or even a few months of original
publication, in five- or six-shilling editions. Lower in the price
scale was the extensive class of railway novels or yellow-backs,
the forms which are now so admirably displayed in the showcase of
Mr. Sadleir's affectionate bibliography.
<ref target="f006.01.21" n="21"><hi rend="super">21</hi></ref> In 1852 this genre was just five
years
old, having originated in the Parlour Library of Simms and
McIntyre, whose volumes were priced at a shilling or a shilling
sixpence. The immediate success of this series had forced Bentley
and Colburn, the proprietors of five-shilling reprint "libraries,"
to come down to 2<hi rend="italic">s.</hi> 6<hi rend="italic">d.</hi> and had inspired other
firms,
notably that of Routledge, to compete with their own reprints at
one or two shillings.<ref target="f006.01.22" n="22"><hi rend="super">22</hi></ref> Though this
represented the greatest movement toward cheap books since the
exciting false dawn between 1828
and 1832, only current literature as a rule was published in this
form, and many valuable publishers' properties&mdash;valuable both
commercially and from the point of view of literature&mdash;were not
made available for cheap reprints. Reprints of standard classics,
best exemplified in this period by the proliferating Bohn
Libraries, were 5<hi rend="italic">s.</hi> or
3<hi rend="italic">s.</hi>6<hi rend="italic">d.</hi></p>
<p>These prices are list. But the year 1852 witnessed a development
which for the next four decades would make the advertised prices
somewhat misleading. For many years an association of publishers
and certain booksellers had enforced what we today call, somewhat
euphemistically, a fair-trade practices agreement, by which anyone
selling the books of those publishers under the list price was
boycotted. In 1852, however, the publisher John Chapman, with the
powerful assistance of most of the celebrated authors of the day as
well as of the <hi rend="italic">Times,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum,</hi> and Mr.
Gladstone, forced the Booksellers' Association to submit their case
for literary protectionism to a board of arbitration headed by Lord
Campbell. The decision was that the principle of free trade, by
then so firmly established in other phases of Britain's economic
life, should be observed in the book trade as well.
<ref target="f006.01.23" n="23"><hi rend="super">23</hi></ref> As a result, down to the nineties,
one could, with a little shopping about, buy a new book at a reduction of two or three pence
on the shilling.<ref target="f006.01.24" n="24"><hi rend="super">24</hi></ref> Hence books were
not quite as expensive as the advertised prices would indicate.</p>



<pb n="006.012"/>

<p>But how many people could afford to buy books even at this
discount? It may well be that the amazing success of <hi rend="italic">Uncle Tom's
Cabin</hi> and the great leaps of periodical circulation were due in
part to the favorable economic conditions prevailing in the early
fifties. Employment was high, money was plentiful, and prices were
generally low. Thus the economic barrier to book-buying was less
formidable than it had been in the hungry forties or was to be in
the later fifties and sixties. But it was still sufficiently high
to bar great segments of the population. In 1852 about 110,000
persons had a taxable income of more than &pound;150 a year, but of
these, 75%, or about 83,000, received less than &pound;400,
<ref target="f006.01.25" n="25"><hi rend="super">25</hi></ref> and one suspects that for most of
them the purchase of an occasional five-shilling reprint, more
frequently of a shilling railway novel, and of one or two cheap
periodicals or Sunday newspapers a week would have been the extent
of their spending for
reading-matter. (There were no penny daily papers until after the
abolition of the stamp tax in 1855.) Those who simply had to have
new books about the house found it more economical to spend a
guinea for a year's privileges at Mudie's than to buy books
outright. In a household whose weekly income ranged from three to
eight pounds little money remained after the necessities had been
provided for: not even when beef was selling at 8<hi rend="italic">d.</hi> a pound.
Furthermore, most of the population were worse off than those who
had a taxable income. The average family of a skilled artisan had
an annual income of only &pound;90, or 34<hi rend="italic">s.</hi> a week,
<ref target="f006.01.26" n="26"><hi rend="super">26</hi></ref> and the hundreds of thousands of
working-class families could count on far less than that. The
average weekly wage in Lancashire and Cheshire was only
9<hi rend="italic">s.</hi>6<hi rend="italic">d.</hi> a week.
<ref target="f006.01.27" n="27"><hi rend="super">27</hi></ref> For
the great bulk of the population, then, book-buying was out of the
question except for the very cheap
part-issues of Salisbury Square fiction or the shilling
yellow-back; what reading was done, was done in cheap periodicals,
whether of the <hi rend="italic">Reynolds' Miscellany</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Family
Herald</hi> type, and weekly newspapers, which cost only 2<hi rend="italic">d.</hi> or
3<hi rend="italic">d.</hi> As a very general conclusion, we may conjecture that the
market for ordinary trade books, at the prices then prevailing, was
limited to the 27,000 or so families with an annual income of more
than &pound;400, and that for the one-or two-shilling reprints, the
cheapest books published, to the 110,000 families with more than
&pound;150 a year. All the rest of the readers in Britain in 1852
formed a market for cheap periodicals alone.</p>
<p>Even among those who were financially able to be occasional
patrons of the bookshop or the library, however, there were many
thousands who

<pb n="006.013"/>

seldom if ever stepped inside either one. In the educational
experience of the great majority of the people there had been
absolutely nothing to encourage a taste for reading as an adult
pastime. Even among the substantial middle class, most men, and
even more women, had been to school for only a few years, and while
they had learned to perform the mechanical operation of reading,
the books they had practised upon, books of dull, pious
edification, were not calculated to give them any enduring
affection for printed matter in hard covers. No incentive came from
the teachers, who were themselves wretchedly uneducated. In the
classroom all forces seemingly conspired to breed an everlasting
distaste for reading, and anyone who knows what elementary
education was like in nineteenth-century England must consider it
miraculous that, under the circumstances, the reading habit was as
widespread as it was.<ref target="f006.01.28" n="28"><hi rend="super">28</hi></ref> Nor was this
true only of the schools to which the
masses of children went. The witnesses before a Parliamentary
commission in the early sixties were virtually unanimous in
declaring that in the great public schools of the nation no effort
whatsoever was made to encourage the boys to read for pleasure or
general culture, and that as a result few did.
<ref target="f006.01.29" n="29"><hi rend="super">29</hi></ref> Nor was the situation very much
better
in the universities. No doubt many readers of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> and
holders of baccalaureate degrees shared the feeling of the
forthright Colonel Sibthorp, M.P. for Lincoln, when he confided to
Commons in 1850 that "he did not like reading at all, and he hated
it when at Oxford."<ref target="f006.01.30" n="30"><hi rend="super">30</hi></ref> I am persuaded

that English educational practices&mdash;which were dominated either by
the Gradgrind philosophy of the age or by the decayed classical
tradition&mdash;were more instrumental than any other single element in
limiting the size of the nineteenth-century book-reading public. I
have no illusions about
the educational accomplishments of our own day, but in this
respect, at least, I am certain that we do no worse than the
Victorians did.</p>
<p>In 1852, it is true, the newspapers contained what appeared to
be a hopeful sign. This was the year when the first free library to
be established under Ewart's Act was opened at Manchester. The
orators there, as at other library dedications in the next few
years, exhausted much rhetoric in hailing the public-library
movement as a symbol of the spread of the reading habit among the
people. But actually the movement was in

<pb n="006.014"/>

no sense a popular one. Ewart's Bill was pushed through Parliament
by a small band of reformers, behind whom was no strong force of
opinion on the part either of the working class or of the middle
class. And once local corporations were empowered to levy a small
tax for library buildings, relatively few did so. Never during the
rest of the century did public libraries enjoy really popular
support. In town after town general apathy and, on the part of the
ratepayers, vehement opposition, defeated the efforts of a minority
to provide free reading facilities for the public at large.
<ref target="f006.01.31" n="31"><hi rend="super">31</hi></ref></p>
<p>Conditions of life in the Victorian era were not necessarily
conducive to reading. We hear much about the way in which the
sacred institution of family readings-aloud encouraged a taste for
books, and undoubtedly it did. But even more powerful influences
operated on the other side. For the vast majority of people, there
was little time to read. Only in the textile industry had the
ten-hour day been won; elsewhere the usual work week was
seventy-two hours or more. Shop assistants worked eighty-five to
ninety hours a week, their places of employment remaining open long
into the evening. Women, unless they were well supplied with
servants, had hardly any more leisure, and such leisure as they did
enjoy was in inverse proportion to the number of children with whom
they were blessed. The only day of theoretical rest was Sunday, but
a good part of it was spent at church, and in what hours remained,
one's choice of reading-matter was severely limited, in most
middle-class Victorian
households, by the Sabbatarian ban on any but religious books. We
need not wonder, as has been pointed out more than once, that the
Victorians were so well versed in <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi> and
<hi rend="italic">The
Pilgrim's Progress:</hi> they were two of the least deadly books on
the list approved for Sunday reading.</p>
<p>In fact, what with the pressure of work and the ban on secular
reading on Sunday, the only extended leisure many Victorians had
for reading was when they made a railway journey. It is no accident
that in the early fifties the new class of cheap light literature
was referred to as "railway reading", and that the biggest volume
of bookselling was beginning to be accomplished at railway termini,
where, in 1852, the stalls of W. H. Smith and Son were becoming
familiar landmarks.<ref target="f006.01.32" n="32"><hi rend="super">32</hi></ref> A long slow
trip in a second-class carriage was one occasion upon which the
earnest Victorian felt that a bit of self-indulgence was
justified&mdash;indeed it was almost indispensable.</p>


<pb n="006.015"/>

<p>In the railway carriage, too, the traveller might, if he were
lucky, find a degree of peace not often enjoyed at home. Throughout
the nineteenth century the average British family&mdash;by which I mean
one of the lower middle class, probably below the income-tax
level&mdash;was living in quarters far too small for it. The crowding
in the homes of the working class was, of course, constantly a
matter for Parliamentary remark; a missionary to the natives of
Spitalfields told a committee at Westminster in 1849 that "I
frequently find as many as seven or eight persons living all in one
room; in that room, perhaps, there will be two looms at work, so
that the noise and discomfort render it almost impossible that a
working man, if he were ever so well inclined to read, could sit
down and read quietly."<ref target="f006.01.33" n="33"><hi rend="super">33</hi></ref> But
overcrowded conditions existed among a large section of the middle
class as well, because Victorian fertility notoriously had a way of
outrunning Victorian
income. It was a fortunate reader indeed, in any but the fairly
prosperous segment of the population, who could command the
solitude he needed whenever he needed it.</p>
<p>Nor may we neglect the effect of Evangelicalism upon the size of
the Victorian publisher's potential market. This most influential
form of religion, which set the whole tone of life in Victorian
times, immensely stimulated the reading habit, because it stressed
the spiritually salutary effect of contact with the right kind of
moral and religious literature at the same time that it forbade
many kinds of non-literary recreation. The perusal of the printed
word was as vital a part of one's journey to salvation as was
listening to public sermons. The result was a huge increase in the
sale of edifying works of every description. But Evangelicalism had
revived and even intensified the old Puritan distrust of secular
literature, and so thoroughly did this distrust permeate a great
proportion of the middle class, and the church-going portion of the
lower, that it remained in 1852 a strong deterrent to the reading
of ordinary literature, above all fiction.
<ref target="f006.01.34" n="34"><hi rend="super">34</hi></ref>
No Victorian publisher of ordinary trade books, in surveying his
prospective market, could afford to overlook the existence of
multitudes of men and women who may well have been devoted readers,
but who would never think of buying the majority of titles he had
on his list. These people were in the main the patrons of the
specialized religious-book houses and of those general publishers
who maintained strong religious

<pb n="006.016"/>

lists.<ref target="f006.01.35" n="35"><hi rend="super">35</hi></ref> They were, therefore, a
special public, and they decreased by just so much the potential
audience for general reading-matter.</p>
<p>Much of what has been said thus far has implied a point which I
now want particularly to emphasize. In some well-known discussions
of English literary trends at the end of the nineteenth century and
in the beginning of our own we are told that a great deal of
whatever is saddening in post-Victorian literary history can be
attributed to the fragmentation of what had been until recently a
homogeneous public. In other words, whereas the Victorian man of
letters addressed himself to the reading audience at large, his
grandson had to be content with addressing a small splinter of that
audience&mdash;what Arnold called, in another connection, "the saving
remnant." Now as a matter of fact, no Victorian writer, no matter
how popular, was read by the whole contemporary audience.
<ref target="f006.01.36" n="36"><hi rend="super">36</hi></ref> If any lament is to be made over
the
change that has occurred in the reading public during the past
century, it is that the cultured minority, which normally forms the
special audience
of the great men of letters, has not grown apace with the growth of
the total public, and indeed may have actually shrunk. But the
facts forbid us to assume that the extreme social and cultural
diversification of the English reading audience began, say, at the
time of the Education Act of 1870, and that until then the audience
was the ideal homogeneous one recalled, with a kind of wishful
hindsight, in some of our literary histories. Dickens and Eliot and
Thackeray and Tennyson, and for that matter G. P. R. James and
Martin Tupper, wrote for only one or two publics out of the
numerous ones already in existence by mid-century. Actually,
however convenient the practice may be, it is inaccurate to refer
to the "reading public"&mdash;singular&mdash;in any century after the
fifteenth. A few moments' contemplation of the variety of
Elizabethan literature, from Spenser, say,

<pb n="006.017"/>

down to the lowliest chapbook, should dispose once and for all of
the myth that the reading public began to break down into separate
audiences only late in the nineteenth century. What the Victorian
age witnessed was not the beginning of multiple publics but simply
the spectacular growth in both size and influence of certain
publics which had hitherto been either small or not much thought
about. In 1858 Wilkie Collins distinguished four separate
audiences: ". . . the religious public . . . the public which reads
for information . . . the public which reads for amusement, and
patronizes the circulating libraries and the railway bookstalls .
. . [and] the public which reads nothing but newspapers."
<ref target="f006.01.37" n="37"><hi rend="super">37</hi></ref> All of these, except the last, had
existed for centuries. The great difference was that the last two
at least had grown prodigiously, while the cultured minority, the
stable audience for the sort of writing that wins a man a place in
literary history, was
cast more and more into the shadows.</p>

<div2 type="section" n="4"><head></head>
<p>In 1852 publishers generally had not accommodated their policies
to the various realities I have just mentioned. I am not speaking
of those few firms which were busily cashing in on the development
of a mass public by issuing yellow-backs, penny bloods, and other
popular-priced literature. I refer to the old-line firms, the
stalwarts of Paternoster Row, whose conservatism was something of
a scandal in their own time, and who looked down their patrician
noses at the upstart Cassells, Routledges, Reynoldses, Lloyds, and
the rest. They were still firmly committed to the policy which had
dominated the trade in the days of Byron. They continued to assume
that the only public worth publishing for was the public that
bought books at the prevailing prices or subscribed to the
circulating libraries. In 1852 Gladstone told Parliament that
hardly five percent of the books published in England every year
sold more than 500 copies.<ref target="f006.01.38" n="38"><hi rend="super">38</hi></ref> If his
estimate is anywhere
near correct, it means that, in the face of an enormously expanded
interest in reading, most publishers remained content with selling
as many copies of a given title as were normally sold in Pope's
day.</p>
<p>This means, in turn, that the editorial decisions in the
old-established houses were based upon the anticipated reaction of
that same small public of well-heeled buyers who had governed
decisions in the past. The whole economic rationale of publishing
was still what it had been a hundred years before: to make this
small initial clientele pay for the cost of publishing a book.
There was, of course, this difference: whereas earlier the

<pb n="006.018"/>

clientele had been composed of individual purchasers, in Victorian
times it was largely represented by the circulating libraries. This
circumstance worked to the advantage of the publisher, and to the
disadvantage of every man who wanted books for his own shelves. The
publisher could, and, it is notorious, did rely upon Mudie and his
confr&egrave;res to take a substantial part of the initial edition of
any work intended for the general reader, and the library
operators, who in any event got a large discount, were not disposed
to quibble about prices. So the publisher could afford to be quite
indifferent to the fact that he was pricing his wares out of the
reach of the ordinary purchaser. If the book subsequently had a
success in a cheap reprint, well and good; that meant so much extra
profit for the publisher. But, in contrast to the situation in the
middle of the twentieth century, the reprint audience did not
figure in the original calculations which attended the editorial
decision.
The silent guest at the table around which such decisions were
made, therefore, was not so much the individual reader (whether a
man with a guinea and a half to spend, or only two shillings) but
his surrogate, Mr. Mudie. And though Mudie had immense influence on
what was published, there is no proof that he was an infallibly
shrewd diviner of current taste. He did not have to be; so long as
the circulating library was the chief means by which the public got
to read newly published books, he had the power, at least as much
as did the publishers, to decide what it should be given to read.
He may have been wrong quite frequently (his strong views on
morality in literature are so well known as to need no comment),
but there was little the public could do about it. Under these
circumstances, the tastes of the audience influenced editorial
decisions only at second hand.</p>
<p>Now and again there were protests against this state of
affairs&mdash;both against the strangle-hold of the libraries and
against the whole resulting policy of small original editions at
high prices. In 1854, for instance, a writer in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>
urged that "instead of commencing with editions of a guinea, and
gradually coming down in the course of years to cheap editions of
5<hi rend="italic">s.</hi>, all good books on their first appearance shall appeal
to the needy multitude, while the requirements of the fortunate and
lazier few are postponed to a more convenient season."
<ref target="f006.01.39" n="39"><hi rend="super">39</hi></ref> If that reversal of traditional policy

had come about, the whole basis of editorial decisions, and
therefore eventually the whole nature of contemporary literature,
would have been considerably altered. It is fascinating to
speculate what would have happened to the reading public, and to
literature in general,

<pb n="006.019"/>

if the firms which published most of the age's great writers&mdash;the
Smith Elders, the Chapman and Halls, the Macmillans and Murrays and
Longmans&mdash;had seriously attempted a policy of cheap original
editions. What concessions would they have asked their writers to
make in order to appeal to the much larger audience they then would
have had? Would Macaulay and Carlyle and Thackeray and the rest
have written any differently if they had had in view an immediate
audience of hundreds of thousands instead of tens of
thousands?<ref target="f006.01.40" n="40"><hi rend="super">40</hi></ref></p>
<p>As it was, however, the reading of the masses was allowed to be
chiefly the concern of the handful of publishers who had discovered
that publishing in cheap form and large volume, however lacking in
respectability it might be, was not necessarily ruinous. But
because in the nature of things they could not pay large prices to
authors for original work, they were limited to the productions of
hacks, or to copyright works which other publishers were willing to
part with, or to translations, or, finally, to American works,
which were unprotected by international copyright. It is quite true
that the cheap publishers occasionally made available at
three-and-six or even at a shilling books of serious content and
genuine literary merit, but these were almost lost in the flood of
vapid or sensational trash. Under such circumstances, the word
"cheap" did not have an exclusively economic reference; it had an
aesthetic, and often a moral, one as well. In this way the
publishing situation
contributed to the division of the total reading public into two
worlds, the small one of the intellectual &eacute;lite, who could pay
either the publisher or Mudie for what they wanted, and the
infinitely greater one of those who perforce had to want what they
could pay for.</p>
<p>It would be absurd, of course, to argue that the masses of
people read what they did just because it was forced upon them by
publishing conditions beyond their control, and because there was
nothing better for them to read at a price they could pay. They
bought hundreds of thousands of copies of cheap papers every week
simply because they liked what they found therein, and most of
them, even if the whole rich store of current book publications had
been laid before them at sixpence or a shilling a title, would have
kept on reading <hi rend="italic">Reynolds' Miscellany</hi> and

<pb n="006.020"/>

the <hi rend="italic">News of the World</hi> to the exclusion of nearly everything
else. Nevertheless, it would be unrealistic to assume that in a
mass audience of this size, in an era when self-improvement was so
much in the air, there were not many people who were ready and
eager for reading-matter of a better sort and who suffered from
what was in effect a literary disfranchisement.</p>
<p>Such people had little opportunity to make their wants known
even when they were conscious of them. The self-appointed spokesmen
for the common reader were almost wholly unconcerned with the
<hi rend="italic">literary</hi> improvement of popular reading-matter. This is well
illustrated by the whole tone of the testimony before the committee
of Commons which was appointed in 1851, as the result of pressure
from a few liberal members, to look into the advisability of
abolishing the newspaper stamp. Opposition to the proposal was
based chiefly upon the historic identification of the cheap press
with radicalism. The task of the men who agitated for a removal of
the penny newspaper duty was to show that the reading tastes of the
masses had improved so far that there was now no danger of a
revival of the "scurrilous" and "immoral" publications, such as the
<hi rend="italic">Penny Satirist</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Cleave's Penny Gazette,</hi>
which
had
enjoyed favor a decade or so before.</p>
<p>A star witness before the committee was Abel Heywood, the
leading wholesale newsagent of Manchester, who analyzed his
business in this way: The more respectable of the mass-circulation
periodicals had a weekly sale of from 9,000 (for the <hi rend="italic">Family
Herald</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">London Journal</hi>) down to 600 (for
<hi rend="italic">Eliza
Cook's Journal</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Household Words</hi>). Two principal

weekly newspapers, the <hi rend="italic">News of the World</hi> and the
<hi rend="italic">Weekly
Times,</hi> sold 3,500 and 4,000 respectively. At the bottom of the
scale came the frankly sensational number-publications, the
equivalents of today's pulps. G. W. M. Reynolds' <hi rend="italic">Court of
London</hi> sold 1,500 a week, while the current Lloyd penny
dreadfuls&mdash;<hi rend="italic">Three-Fingered Jack, The Adventures of Captain
Hawk,
Mazeppa, Love and Mystery,</hi> almost twenty different titles in
all&mdash;sold <hi rend="italic">in the aggregate</hi> 3,400. As a not wholly
irrelevant footnote, it must be added that Heywood sold penny
numbers of Shakespeare at a rate of 150 a
week.<ref target="f006.01.41" n="41"><hi rend="super">41</hi></ref></p>
<p>Heywood, who spoke with the authority of long experience in his
trade and the prejudice of a veteran backer of popular causes,
construed his own figures as showing that there had been a
remarkable improvement in popular taste, and other witnesses
testified to the same effect. The papers whose circulation had most
benefited by the growth of the

<pb n="006.021"/>

reading habit in recent years were those of a "good tendency"; the
immoral and seditious ones had been driven from the market. This
was, they maintained, proof of a sort of literary inversion of
Gresham's law: good reading-matter, if given half a chance, would
inevitably drive out bad.<ref target="f006.01.42" n="42"><hi rend="super">42</hi></ref></p>
<p>But their definition of "good reading-matter" was determined not
by any literary or cultural standards but by existing political and
social conditions. When the great concern was whether cheap
publications would or would not contribute to a fresh unsettling of
the populace, the specifically literary qualities of the <hi rend="italic">Family
Herald</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">London Journal</hi> were of no relevance.
The
criterion of acceptable popular reading-matter was, to put it
bluntly, innocuousness. The ideal of the advocates of a cheap press
was simply that the humble reader should be enabled to purchase a
few hours of innocent recreation, without being troubled by any
thoughts dangerous to his own moral welfare or the peace of the
nation. There was no thought of trying to improve the general
cultural tone of the people's reading; enough if it were
"safe."</p>
<p>With attention centered upon the mass reading public from this
angle, it was only natural that the need for issuing works of true
literary merit in cheap form in order to encourage the elevation of
popular taste, and the actual existence of a market for such
publications, should have been largely neglected. During the decade
with which we are concerned, however, there were several signs
which gave promise that the man of some intellectual ambition but
little pocket-money, whose tastes were not irrevocably fixed upon
the sensational newspaper and the shilling shocker, was slowly
making his presence felt.</p>
<p>Two significant events occurred in the periodical field. In 1850
Dickens began his twopenny <hi rend="italic">Household Words,</hi> which
immediately attracted an audience for which the half-crown
monthlies were too expensive and the popular weekly papers too
frivolous and crude. Both of the two major predecessors of
<hi rend="italic">Household Words</hi> among the cheap weeklies had failed to
satisfy this audience. The <hi rend="italic">Penny Magazine,</hi> whose connection

with the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge limited its
contents to instructional articles and discouraged the introduction
of fiction, had gone under in 1845. <hi rend="italic">Chambers's Journal,</hi>
although it did print fiction, and for that reason still had favor
among a certain clientele, was studiously following its original
policy of cultivating inoffensiveness to the point of what
contemporary observers called "namby-pambyness." <hi rend="italic">Household
Words,</hi> under Dickens' vigorous direction, escaped both
pitfalls: it printed plenty of fiction, and it was
not afraid, in its serious articles, to speak out

<pb n="006.022"/>

on current issues. Furthermore, its contributors included many
highly competent writers. The gratitude with which it was received
is measured by its circulation, which ran as high as 40,000
weekly.<ref target="f006.01.43" n="43"><hi rend="super">43</hi></ref></p>
<p>But that figure, exciting as it was for the time, was eclipsed
when George Smith launched the <hi rend="italic">Cornhill Magazine</hi> early in
1860, with a staff of contributors that reads today like a Who's
Who of Victorian literature. No less than 120,000 men and women
bought the first issue, and though the initial circulation did not
hold up, during the first two years the <hi rend="italic">Cornhill's</hi> average
monthly sale, at a shilling, was 84,000 copies.
<ref target="f006.01.44" n="44"><hi rend="super">44</hi></ref></p>
<p>The success of these two innovations in periodical literature,
at prices within the reach of at least all middle-class readers,
was evidence of a steadily expanding market for serious
reading-matter. In the book trade, additional evidence was supplied
by the spectacular prosperity of John Cassell's publishing
enterprises. Beginning in 1852 with his <hi rend="italic">Popular Educator,</hi> a
sort of high-school-at-home course, Cassell adapted the old
technique of number-publishing to new conditions and brought out in
instalments scores of excellent standard works in history,
literature, and other fields. It is significant that the man who
made the discovery that supplying the people with truly solid books
could become a big and lucrative business had no background in
publishing at all; he had entered the trade only three or four
years earlier, after a career as a temperance lecturer and packer
of tea and coffee. Seemingly it took a rank outsider to succeed
where old professionals like Charles
Knight had failed.<ref target="f006.01.45" n="45"><hi rend="super">45</hi></ref></p>
<p>Another indication of the growth of serious taste among those
who were still neglected by the great publishers is the success of

publishers experimented with series of English classics at
competing prices.<ref target="f006.01.46" n="46"><hi rend="super">46</hi></ref> And that there
was a similar market lower down in society for standard literature
is shown by the prosperity of the 32mo. Cottage Library of Milner
and Sowerby, a provincial firm which, in its first years at least,
sold its output mainly at country fairs. The Cottage Library books
were not handsome, but they offered a great deal of reading-matter
for a shilling, and the list, which appealed to every conceivable
taste, eventually climbed to over five hundred titles.
<ref target="f006.01.47" n="47"><hi rend="super">47</hi></ref></p>
<p>These were straws in the wind, and eventually they would be
heeded by the great publishers who in 1852 held aloof from contact
with the mass audience. Cheaper and better books did become
available to the additional millions who were made literate by the
extension of education during the second half of the century. But
by that time the great opportunity had passed. In 1852 the habits
and tastes of the new mass audience were not yet crystallized. The
people were wretchedly educated, to be sure, and their tastes were
crude; but they could still have been taught to like better things.
The accidents of publishing, however, as much as any other single
factor, caused the new audience to associate the reading habit with
a certain type of reading-matter, a type deplored by all
contemporary observers and no less by those at a distance of a
century. This in turn&mdash;increasingly so as the mass audience began
to influence editorial decisions&mdash;set the permanent course of
publishing for the
millions, with its implied dismal assumptions regarding the level
of popular taste, and so a vicious circle was created, which has
never been broken. Perhaps it is too late now to break it. But
while we browse in the files of old periodicals and read the
Victorians' ceaseless complaints of the unutterable vulgarity of
"the million's" reading tastes&mdash;complaints so feelingful and
comprehensive that our own seem but tired echoes&mdash;we may perhaps
speculate whether, under happier circumstances, the history of
English popular culture might not have taken a different turn. If
a few influential publishers had had more vision, more willingness
to experiment, more

missionary spirit; if somehow the art of sound popularization had
been learned while there was still time; if the railway bookstalls
and the hole-in-the-wall newsvendors had had Penguins and Pocket
Books in stock&mdash;</p>
<p>But the realities of the Victorian situation were quite another
thing.</p>

(New

must not be interpreted too strictly. There were five editions of
the poem between June, 1850 and November, 1851; the first and fifth
were of 5,000 copies each, and probably the others were of about
the same size or slightly larger (Edgar F. Shannon, Jr.,
<hi rend="italic">Tennyson and the Reviewers</hi> [1952], pp. 146, 156). But even
if, as is likely, the figure of 60,000 represents sales over a
period of several years rather than months, it is still a
remarkable short-term total for a book of poetry. One must remember
that the records achieved by other Victorian best-sellers in this

the preface to the first bound volume of the magazine (1832). He
repeats it in his <hi rend="italic">Passages from a Working Life</hi> (1864-65),
II, 184. However, in 1855, replying to an inquiry addressed to him
on behalf of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Knight wrote: "In the
first year (1832) it sold about 100,000; in the second, 160,000.
The largest sale was in the third and fourth years" (Alice A.
Clowes, <hi rend="italic">Charles Knight: a Sketch</hi> [1892], pp. 225-226).
Since
the paper was unstamped, government returns are of no help in
establishing the precise facts. It is at least certain that the
circulation of 200,000 was not long sustained, and by 1845 it had
fallen to 40,000 (<hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi>).</p></note>

<note id="f006.01.15" place="foot" n="15"><seg type="note-symbol"><hi rend="super">15</hi></seg><p>The 1849 figure is from William Lovett's
testimony printed in [House of Commons], <hi rend="italic">Select Committee on
Public Libraries</hi> (1849), Q. 2787. In 1851, a witness before
another committee of Parliament gave the <hi rend="italic">Family Herald's</hi>
circulation as 147,000, while another witness put it at "over
200,000" ([House of Commons], <hi rend="italic">Report from the Select Committee
on Newspaper Stamps</hi> [1851], Qq. 973, 2498). The figure for
1855, given in the text, is from Charles Knight (Clowes, cited in
note 14, p. 226). To confuse matters still further, it may be noted
that in the same year, 1855, a speaker in Parliament placed the
<hi rend="italic">Family Herald's</hi> circulation at 240,000 (<hi rend="italic">Hansard's
Parliamentary Debates,</hi> 3rd ser., CXXXVII [1855], col. 783).
This is merely one example, out of many which could be cited, of
the contradictory evidence facing one who wishes to obtain a fairly
accurate picture of the audience for mass-circulation periodicals
in the nineteenth century.
Since the papers were unstamped for the most part, the government
returns are useless, and in any event, the stamp duty was removed
in 1855. There was no Victorian equivalent of the Audit Bureau of
Circulation, and so a periodical publisher's sales figures could be
a matter strictly between himself and God. His public boasts are of
little value, for as the <hi rend="italic">Bookseller</hi> remarked (April 1, 1869,
p. 298), "many of our contemporaries . . . publish particulars
respecting their circulation which must somewhat astonish their
printers." Lacking the actual account-books of the various
publishers, the researcher must be content with such figures as
were hazarded at the time, on good authority or bad, and try not to
become too exercised over the frequent disagreement among
witnesses.</p></note>

<name type="title">The 'Private Issues' of <hi rend="italic">The Deserted
Village</hi></name>
<lb/><hi rend="italic">by</hi><lb/>
<name type="author">William B. Todd</name></head>

<div2 type="section" n="1"><head></head>
<p>Of the many romances which have been featured in the tabloids of
the bibliophiles, perhaps the most enchanting is the tale of the
"private" or&mdash;as otherwise described&mdash;the "trial" issues of
Goldsmith's <hi rend="italic">Deserted Village</hi>. One, or some, or all of these
little duodecimos were especially printed before the first quarto,
we are informed, either at the instance of Bishop Percy for
presentation to the Countess of Northumberland or, according to the
other hypothesis, at the request of a finicky author who wished to
obtain several proofs for the purpose of tinkering with the
punctuation.</p>
<p>For evidence as to the priority of these "issues," reference is
usually made to a copy discovered in 1896, which presumes to be,
according to a MS inscription on its title-page, "the first
privately printed edition before the 4to. of May, 1770."
<ref target="f006.02.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref> Whether this notation is
attributable
to an exacting scholar of the last century, or a wishful book
collector, or a zealous auctioneer, no one knows. Yet it is
generally accepted, and upon this inadmissable hearsay the first
elaboration, concerning the gift to the Countess, then follows on
the authority of a person who, at the time he offered his
conjecture, had never seen a copy,<ref target="f006.02.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref>
and the second, concerning the necessity for proofs, on the
testimony of a critic who later retracted all that he had
said.<ref target="f006.02.03" n="3"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref> Though these and other
considerations have led a few scholars to deny both stories, their
protests have not availed against the extravagant
claims of Goldsmith's bibliographers or the raucous cries

<pb n="006.026"/>

of the booksellers.<ref target="f006.02.04" n="4"><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref> Nonetheless,
as we shall see, the reasoned opinion of the few can be completely
vindicated.</p>
<p>Even if there were no retractions and no evidence to the
contrary, both theories are incredible and readily disproved.
Against the first, or "private issue" version is the fact that
whereas Percy, in his recollection of an event thirty years in the
past, listed the date of original issue as 1769,
<ref target="f006.02.05" n="5"><hi rend="super">5</hi></ref> all of the early "London" editions,
duodecimo and quarto, are dated 1770.

<pb n="006.027"/>

Moreover, as the various title pages attest, all were printed, not
for the Bishop, nor the Countess, nor the author, but purportedly
"for W. Griffin," a publisher who had no connection with any of
Percy's enterprises, public or private. Against the second, or
"trial issue" version is the certainty that, whatever the order of
editions, none of the alterations are substantial, none would
concern the author, and none would necessitate such an
extraordinary procedure as that involved in the composition of a
series of proofs, each in a different setting of type, many in a
considerable quantity, and all in a format unlike that of the
published edition.</p>
<p>If either of these false suppositions is accepted on the basis
of what has been adduced, the way is open for the admission of any
and all comers. Thus two undated editions "Printed for the
Booksellers in Town and Country" can also be awarded precedence
over the first quarto on the warrant of testimony quite similar to
that previously mentioned, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> (1) an inscription in a copy
now at the University of Chicago reading "May 6. 1770"&mdash;twenty
days before the publication of the quarto&mdash;and (2) in apparent
confirmation, a note in a bookseller's catalogue that copies with
this imprint represent "the excessively rare pirated edition made
instantly on the success of the first [<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, "private"]
issue of the poem."<ref target="f006.02.06" n="6"><hi rend="super">6</hi></ref> Here, as for
the duodecimos, the ascription would seem to be indisputable. But
again, as before, the witnesses are unreliable and easily refuted,
in this instance, by a contemporary reference to the issuance of
one of the
"Booksellers" editions actually in 1784, fourteen years after the
date alleged.<ref target="f006.02.07" n="7"><hi rend="super">7</hi></ref></p>
<p>With this date established, notwithstanding several
"authorities," the priority of all editions in duodecimo format can
be impugned; for all have the shoddy appearance of the many
chapbooks produced at the time, all are closely related to the
"Booksellers" variants, all include textual matter in the initial
gathering (the usual sign of a later reprinting), and all were
issued&mdash;as I shall endeavor to show&mdash;under circumstances
quite
different from those generally assigned.</p>
</div2>

<div2 type="section" n="2">
<head>I. The Number and Order of Editions</head>

<p>Besides the four "1770" editions posing as "private" or "trial
issues," we may now identify at least twenty-two other separate
editions of the poem.<ref target="f006.02.08" n="8"><hi rend="super">8</hi></ref> All
twenty-six were apparently printed within the copyright period

<pb n="006.028"/>

(ranging, in this instance, from 1770 to 1784) or immediately upon
its expiration; but only eleven represent an authoritative sequence
repeatedly revised in the earlier editions and regularly published,
first by William Griffin, then by his authorized successors,
Rivington, Carnan, and Cadell. These legitimate editions will be
designated hereafter by their size, either as Q (editions 1-10) or
8vo (edition 11). The other fifteen, representing with one
exception unrevised texts deriving ultimately from Q1 and issued
without authorization under various imprints, real and assumed, are
identified by the letters assigned below. (A complete description
of these is given in Section III.)</p>

<p>Altogether, then, we are concerned with thirty-two editions,
differentiated by size, letter, or date, and now demonstrated to
have a certain interrelation indicated by the following stemma:

 <!-- <figure entity="sb06291"></figure> --></p>
<p>This graphic account should effectively dispose of the various
figments of the legend, including the assumption that each
succeeding imprint was an improvement over the one before, the
inference that C was therefore the first of a series advancing
through B and A toward Q1, and the wild surmise that C, as the
original "private issue," was presented to the Countess of
Northumberland late in 1769. On the contrary, it is now apparent
that, as always with reprints, each is a further corruption of the
one before, that each moves not up toward Q1 but down toward E, an
edition honestly dated 1777, and&mdash;if some personality is required
to displace the Countess&mdash;that it is James Boswell Esq. who is
found with a copy of C, not in the winter of 1769 but in the spring
of 1783. To verify this fact all the mythologists need do is to
turn from the Goldsmith bibliographies to the adjoining section on
Samuel Johnson and there, in the second volume of the <hi rend="italic">R. B. Adam
Library,</hi> examine a
facsimile of a page from this edition with Boswell's comment and
date.<ref target="f006.02.00" n="9a"><hi rend="super">9a</hi></ref> Here, as opposed to an
anonymous note discovered over a hundred years after the event, is

<pb n="006.030"/>

reliable testimony of the time by a person known for his attention
to details.</p>
<p>Thus reassured, we may now consider the evident realities. From
A to J in one sequence, from K to O in others, and doubtless for
still others which have thus far escaped identification,
<ref target="f006.02.10" n="10"><hi rend="super">10</hi></ref> all of the separate editions
represent
a series of degraded texts cheaply produced at various times and
places with the obvious intention of cutting in on the profits due
the author and his publisher. To protect their interests, the
owners of the poem relied upon their copyright; but as this was
severely limited, extending in time only fourteen years from the
original date of publication and in place only to England and
Scotland, it hardly served to deter the more enterprising printers
of the day. Anyone with a business in Ireland or on the continent,
two areas beyond the reach of the law, might therefore openly
identify himself in the imprint of his issue or, if he had a
reputation to maintain, allow the issue to circulate anonymously.
Hence all we need to know of
such editions as L, M, and O is candidly admitted on the title
page, and all we might want to know of the anonymous N is soon
disclosed by the imprint of its copytext and its own watermark,
both of which read BELFAST.</p>
<p>With other early editions, however, the attempt at concealment
is far more successful, for more than reputation is involved. Quite
naturally, to avoid the penalty of the law, various subterfuges
were employed, all of which must now come under examination.</p>
<p>One distinctive feature common to many of these editions is the
fictitious "Printed for W. Griffin," an imprint used to such good
effect, apparently, that the publisher was never able to discover
who had appropriated his name and, with it, much of his income. Yet
as Griffin might have declared, and as we now perceive, none of
these editions bears any resemblance to the various works which he
had printed and published. Contrary to the practice in his shop,
all appear without press figures, habitually use founts other than
Caslon, elide the final 'e' in past participles, hyphenate
compounds, modernize the spelling, ignore the revisions which
appear in his later quartos, arbitrarily shift one paragraph
division and create another.<ref target="f006.02.11" n="11"><hi rend="super">11</hi></ref>
Moreover, among the earlier editions, A&mdash;D

<pb n="006.031"/>

are in 12&deg; half-sheets, an unusual imposition for any London
publication of this time; A&mdash;E persistently convert "woe" to "wo,"
a variant spelling not used by Griffin's compositors;
<ref target="f006.02.12" n="12"><hi rend="super">12</hi></ref> D&mdash;E separate the date in
the imprint
with commas, a practice common to provincial issues but not
observed in Griffin's books; and E alone ingenuously uses the date
1777, two years after Griffin's death.
<ref target="f006.02.13" n="13"><hi rend="super">13</hi></ref> Of itself, this latter circumstance
suggests that some of these editions were far removed from the
scene described in their imprints.</p>
<p>To all this must be added still another peculiarity. Though the
five duodecimos are much alike, superficially, and so designed to
pass under a common disguise, each is slightly different in size,
type, and ornamentation. It is quite probable, therefore, that
these are not only far removed from Griffin's shop, but removed in
five different directions.</p>
<p>Aside from the duodecimos one other separate edition is known
with

<pb n="006.032"/>

Griffin's address. This is F, a 1775 octavo in half-sheets, with a
title page reading "By Oliver Goldsmith, M.B." and imprinted
"Catherine-Street, in the Strand." Both in the use of the author's
medical degree and in the spelling of "Catharine" with an 'e', this
issue differs from all "Griffin" books except the <hi rend="italic">Miscellaneous
Works</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Select Poems,</hi> two collections of
similar
imposition and date. As may be demonstrated for F, and safely
assumed for the <hi rend="italic">Poems</hi>,<ref target="f006.02.14" n="14"><hi rend="super">14</hi></ref>
both
owe these similarities to the fact that they are separate
reimpressions or "offprints" from the collected <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>. All
three, then, betray some of the idiosyncrasies derived from
copytext A, share among themselves a peculiar ascription and
imprint not used by Griffin, and suspiciously appear as a group in
the very year of Griffin's death. But again, as with the separate
edition E, a deception once engaged in is practiced too often: In
1778, long after Griffin
had ceased to care about the raids on his literary property,
another edition of the <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> was produced with his name in
the imprint.</p>
<p>So far, our survey of the 'Griffin' imprints A&mdash;F allows
several conclusions: (1) that all six are textually related, (2)
that some are deliberate imitations, one of another, (3) that each,
nonetheless, is sufficiently distinct to suggest its origin in a
different shop, and (4) that none, despite the pretensions of all,
is an issue from "Garrick's Head, in Catharine-street, Strand."
Furthermore, by exhibiting characteristics uncommon to London
publications of the time and repeating information which had long
since

<pb n="006.033"/>

become invalid, it would seem that certain of these editions
appeared at some distance from the Strand. Precisely where or when,
however, are questions which, with the exception of one edition,
may never be determined.</p>
<p>The evidence for the one edition, the critical one in the
sequence, comes providentially from the reviews. According to their
usual practice, the London journals cite immediately from the
original quarto edition.<ref target="f006.02.15" n="15"><hi rend="super">15</hi></ref> Many of
those issued in provincial towns, on the other hand, reproduce any
available text, usually that offered in some other magazine. Thus
in its account of the "Deserted Village" the Newcastle <hi rend="italic">Literary
Register</hi> quotes first from the <hi rend="italic">Critical Review,</hi> then
from the <hi rend="italic">Monthly Review</hi>.
<ref target="f006.02.16" n="16"><hi rend="super">16</hi></ref>
Another provincial journal, the <hi rend="italic">Weekly Magazine, or Edinburgh
Amusement,</hi> also offers mixed citations; and in this mixture we
find the clue we seek. Three weeks after the publication of the
quarto the <hi rend="italic">Magazine,</hi> in two successive issues dated June 14
and 21, reprints the first 194 lines. Then, after another delay of
four weeks, the citation continues, in the July 19 issue, through
line 252.
Apparently, as collation indicates, the earlier printing was
derived from the 194 lines quoted in the <hi rend="italic">London Chronicle</hi>
of
May 26-29, the later, from another text which had become available
in the meantime. That text, undoubtedly, is the one described as
A.</p>
<p>The implications of this discovery are obvious. If Walter
Ruddiman, the printer and publisher of the Edinburgh
<hi rend="italic">Magazine,</hi> is not the principal agent in the manufacture of
the first of these piracies, as we must now call them all, he is
certainly an accessory after the fact. Though slight and scattered,
the evidence is nevertheless incriminating. Here, in this man's
shop, seven weeks after the issuance of the quarto and 395 miles
distant from London, we find a copy of the duodecimo printing. Here
too we encounter a person already in contempt of the laws relating
to the stamp tax<ref target="f006.02.17" n="17"><hi rend="super">17</hi></ref> and therefore
quite ready, we may suppose, to evade any others pertaining to
copyright. And here again we observe, in abundance, the several
features which distinguish many of these editions from Griffin's
publications, notably the elided 'e' in participles, the
interspersed commas in imprint dates, and the occasional production
of books in duodecimo
half-sheets.<ref target="f006.02.18" n="18"><hi rend="super">18</hi></ref>

<pb n="006.034"/>

Even more damning is the fact that the title page of the A reprint
and Ruddiman's work is composed of the peculiar bold face letter
manufactured by John Baine, a type-founder then residing in
Edinburgh.<ref target="f006.02.19" n="19"><hi rend="super">19</hi></ref> Before us, then, is a
disreputable printer of known habits, using material similar to
that found in the book, and discovered with a copy in his
possession. Unless he can escape by placing the blame on some close
neighbor, Walter Ruddiman of Forester's Wynd, Lawn-market,
Edinburgh, should therefore be charged with pirating a copy of the
"Deserted Village" on or about July 15, 1770.</p>
<p>Once the A reprint appeared it served, not only as the copytext
for Ruddiman's <hi rend="italic">Magazine</hi>, but also for many of the other
piracies now identified. By a kind of Gresham's law, these inferior
texts, selling perhaps at sixpence a copy, and multiplying in
various little shops around the countryside, must have had an
enormous sale among those who could not afford two shillings for
the authorized editions. The opportunity for a quick return
undoubtedly attracted many unscrupulous vendors, among whom might
be named Francis Robertson of Edinburgh, a notorious expert in
duplications of the kind represented by B, C, and D, and Alexander
Donaldson, of Edinburgh and London, a specialist in cheap reprints
of work not specifically covered by copyright.
<ref target="f006.02.20" n="20"><hi rend="super">20</hi></ref></p>
<p>Donaldson's role in these depredations is perhaps not beyond
conjecture. By a strange turn of events which could hardly have
gone unnoticed by this publisher and others of his ilk, much of
Goldsmith's property lay for awhile, if not in the public domain,
at least near enough so that it could be snatched at very little
risk. In 1773 the Court of Session, upon Donaldson's appeal,
rendered its historic verdict against the common law interpretation
of copyright; in 1774, the year of Goldsmith's death, the House of
Lords sustained the ruling; and in 1775 fate again intervened to
remove the publisher. All rights held by Griffin were therefore
suspended from 1775 until such time as they were reinstated by his
successors; and for the "Deserted Village" this was not until 1779,
the date

<pb n="006.035"/>

of the ninth Quarto. Yet, as suspension did not amount to
revocation, it was still convenient to hide behind the name of the
original publisher. Under Griffin's imprint, then, the work
continued, possibly by Donaldson for the 1775 issues, separate (F)
and collected, probably by a more distant and less well informed
printer for those dated 1777 (E) and 1778.</p>
<p>Thereafter, when it was finally realized that Griffin had died
long before, and that his copyright was now enforced by others, the
long-practiced scheme of falsification was abandoned in favor of
simple anonymity. This took two forms, either as issue completely
without imprint (G), or as issue "Printed for the Booksellers in
Town and Country" (H, I). Of G all that may be surmised is that it
derives, probably as an offprint, from an unknown collected edition
intervening between others dated 1782 and 1784.
<ref target="f006.02.21" n="21"><hi rend="super">21</hi></ref> The known edition of 1782 is a
12&deg;
in half-sheets in which the text of the "Village" extends from
R6<hi rend="super">r</hi> to S4<hi rend="super">r</hi>; the one of 1784 a full 12&deg;
with text from
12<hi rend="super">r</hi> to I10<hi rend="super">r</hi>; the separate printing G, of
a setting different
from both, but of format like the earlier, and with a vestigial
signature 'S3' which points to some collection based upon the
earlier text.</p>
<p>For the other two surreptitious editions, H and I, the evidence
is external and more outspoken. Apparently these were issued just
before the copyright expired, when it was still inexpedient for the
"Booksellers" to reveal themselves; and again with these, as with
A&mdash;D, we witness the effort of one pirate to duplicate the work of
another. That effort did not go unnoticed by the authorized
publishers, who inserted in the 11th edition of 1784, the year
which terminated their copyright, a notice designed to maintain
their privilege.
</p>
<q>
<p><hi rend="italic">There being a pirated Edition of the</hi> Deserted Village,
<hi rend="italic">which is mentioned in the Title to be "Printed for the

<p>The genuine and correct Editions of the Deserted Village are
printed for J. F. and C. Rivington, T. Carnan, in St. Paul's
Church-yard; and T. Cadell, in the Strand; and are decorated with
a Copper-plate Cut in the Title-page.
<ref target="f006.02.22" n="22"><hi rend="super">22</hi></ref></p>
</q>

<pb n="006.036"/>

<p>The cut for the 11th edition is not that of "The sad historian of
the pensive plain," a vignette much too large for an octavo, but a
bust of the author prepared originally for the first edition of
<hi rend="italic">Retaliation</hi> printed for George Kearsly, and still inscribed
"Published as the Act directs 18<hi rend="super">th</hi> April 1774," though
now
employed for an occasion some ten years later.</p>
<p>By 1784 evidently, if not long before, the provincial issues
were encroaching upon the London market; and by then it was too
late to stop them, for with the end of restrictions any publisher
could safely venture into the open. Among the first to do so, it
would seem, was James Barker, a former apprentice of Griffin's, and
now a prolific purveyor of chapbooks. Like Carnan, Barker felt
called upon, but for much less reason, to advance the merits of his
own printing against the others then on sale, and accordingly
warned the readers of his issue: "<hi rend="italic">N.B.</hi> The Public are
respectfully desired to be careful not to have an inferior Edition
imposed on them, instead of that printed by J. Barker." The only
thing that distinguishes this issue (J) is its appearance, which is
superior to that of all preceding reprints. Barker even outdid his
legitimate competitors by having the original quarto vignette
reversed, reduced, and re-engraved to fit the size of his version.
Unfortunately,
however, he did not consult the quarto for his readings, but was
content to print from one of the latest and least reliable (D) of
the provincial editions.</p>
<p>Another who crept into public view about this time was T.
Martin, a tradesman who describes his proper occupation as a
"Letter-Case Maker" and his place of business at "No. 11, Club Row,
Bethnal Green." Of this let me say, for the benefit of those who
may henceforth label it as a "private issue," that it is the only
London edition immediately related to the first quarto, one
containing an appreciable number of "early readings" definitely
"improved" in the quarto, appearing in smaller size but of the same
format as the quarto, quite exempt from any incriminating dates or
reviews, and known only by a single copy. Thus, ironically enough,
where the earlier reprints fail to meet a single qualification of
the many which might be advanced for a "private issue," the latest
scores on every count. Yet this too is beneath contempt.</p>
<p>With this last printing we have traced the fragmentary history
of fifteen separate editions of the "Deserted Village," each
remarkably debased in appearance, association, and text. All are
mongrels, occasionally sporting some fancy gilt and Zaehnsdorfian
trappings, but essentially without pedigree, without claim to any
distinction other than that accorded the common run of six-penny
pamphlets often found in the bookstalls. What they were then is,
all nonsense aside, what they are now.</p>

<head>III. Check-List of Separate Unauthorized Editions of the
"Deserted Village" with Notes on Other Piracies</head>

<p>Though I have diligently pursued in numerous footnotes the many
ramifications of this extraordinary problem, some questions still
remain for consideration under this heading. For one, as
Goldsmith's bibliographers have not only confused the ordering of
the early "Village" reprints but occasionally provided facsimiles
at variance with their descriptions, it will be necessary to
preface my own list with a table converting previous notations to
the established sequence. For another, while these earlier

<pb n="006.040"/>

accounts do give, after their fashion, much attention to the
"Village" printings, not one mentions a contemporary series of
"Traveller" editions. These occur too frequently to be ignored
here, but thus far not so frequently that someone elsewhere could
<hi rend="italic">make something of them</hi>. To prevent such an attempt, and
whatever notions might come of it, I shall therefore deal with them
summarily under the description of the "Village" editions with
which they are associated.</p>

perhaps at the same time, Johnson was asked to annotate a 12&deg;

<p>Addendum: Of all the known variants of this poem only one can be
properly defined as a "private issue." This is the quarto copy
reported in <hi rend="italic">The Library of William Andrews Clark Jr.</hi>
("Modern English Literature," III, 33-34), and there described as
having a first edition title-page without vignette and a third
edition text. Actually, as the press figures reveal, the text is of
the fifth edition. Preceding this is a conjugate double-leaf of
slightly heavier paper than usual, bearing the watermark of a crest
above the initials LVG (Heawood 1743?), with half-title on
<hi rend="super">i</hi>1,
and on <hi rend="super">i</hi>2 a title in which the area normally occupied by
vignette and edition reference contains an MS. reading "For Miss
Polly Safe 1770, W.A." My thanks to Mr. H. Richard Archer,
bibliographer of the Clark Library, for information regarding this
copy.</p>

<note id="f006.02.03" place="foot" n="3"><seg type="note-symbol"><hi rend="super">3</hi></seg><p>It should be observed that Luther S.
Livingston's assertions, as first presented in <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi>
(April 21, 1900, pp. 499-500) and later amplified in <hi rend="italic">The
Bookman</hi> (N.Y., XII [1901], 563-567), were eventually withdrawn
in an anonymous communication to <hi rend="italic">The Nation</hi> (August 18,
1910, p. 141)&mdash;this as the consequence of Colonel W. F. Prideaux's
examination (in <hi rend="italic">N &amp; Q,</hi> 11th ser., II [July 16, 1910],
41-42) of the textual relation between one of the "private issues"
and the obvious reprint described as J in this study.</p></note>

<note id="f006.02.04" place="foot" n="4"><seg type="note-symbol"><hi rend="super">4</hi></seg><p>To illustrate the divergent opinion of recent
years and the effect of certain statements on the rare-book market,
I subtend a few quotations.
First, the views of those who reject the legend: (1) Editions A, B,
C "have been supposed, but without any good reason, to have
appeared before the first quarto." R. S. Crane, <hi rend="italic">CBEL</hi> (1940),

II, 643. (2) Of edition D, "there is no evidence that it precedes
the quarto and, in fact, reprints, if different in size at all, are
likely and normally smaller than the original issue." W. A.
Jackson, comment on item 452, Parke-Bernet Galleries Sale 1292
(Dec. 3-4, 1951). See also the present writer in <hi rend="italic">Studies in
Bibliography,</hi> IV (1951), 44, 48.
Second, the views of those who accept the legend: (1) On edition B
and later, in the same words, on D, "the first edition, privately
printed." T. J. Wise, <hi rend="italic">Ashley Library,</hi> II (1922), 150; VIII
(1926), 140-41. (2) Apparently in reference to Wise's copy of B, "a
very rare little book, privately printed." I. A. Williams, <hi rend="italic">Seven
XVIIIth Century Bibliographies</hi> (1924), pp. 146-147. (3)
Concerning editions ranged in the order C, B, A, "the fact that
there were three issues of this so-called 'privately printed'
edition, somewhat weakens one's faith in a privately printed issue
. . . though I can understand why [Griffin] should venture on small
'trial editions'." Temple Scott, <hi rend="italic">Oliver Goldsmith
Bibliographically and Biographically Considered</hi> (1928), p. 246.
(4) In an account of Lord Rothschild's copy of edition C: "first
edition, first issue . . . very rare, privately printed 'trial
issue' of the poem." John Hayward, <hi rend="italic">English Poetry, An
Illustrated Catalogue</hi> (1950),
item 184. It is my understanding that this description is to be
corrected in the forthcoming catalogue of the Rothschild Library.
Third, in consequence of these sensational pronouncements, a record
of extraordinary prices realized on the market: Maggs, July 15,
1929: &pound;640 (&dollar;3110 at the exchange rate then prevailing). Gabriel
Wells, June 16, 1930: &pound;450 (&dollar;2190). Anderson Galleries, Jerome
Kern sale, Jan. 7-10, 1929: &dollar;3900 and &dollar;1200; the Roderick Terry
sale, May 2-3, 1934: &dollar;1300; the Courtland Bishop sale, April 5-8,
1938: &dollar;2100.</p></note>

<note id="f006.02.05" place="foot" n="5"><seg type="note-symbol"><hi rend="super">5</hi></seg><p>Actually the reference did not originate with
Percy in 1801, as commonly supposed, but in the 1777 Dublin
<hi rend="italic">Poems and Plays,</hi> the ultimate copytext for a series of
editions extending into the 19th century. In the 1777 edition (and
usually in the many reprints) the poem is mistakenly advertised on
its flyleaf as "First printed in M,DCC,LXIX"; and the entire book
(together with some of the reprints) claims to present "several
Additions and Corrections never before printed; being the only
perfect one ever published of this celebrated Author's Poems."
Neither assertion is acceptable. Against the first is the specific
notice in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Advertiser</hi> for Saturday, May 26, 1770,
that the Deserted Village was to be published "This Day at Twelve."
Against the second is an evident indication that, for this one
poem, the "Additions and Corrections" comprise various readings
chosen at random from the earlier separate printings. Thus at lines
67, 101, 111, 184,
and 315 the 1777 edition follows readings which appear only in Q1,
at 108 a revision first introduced in Q2, and at 81-82 and 125
revisions first introduced in Q4. (For citation of revisions, see
Section II.) This conglomerate text is followed in the 1780 London
edition similarly titled, in the one volume <hi rend="italic">Poetical Works</hi>
(n.d.), in the Perth edition of the <hi rend="italic">Miscellaneous Works</hi>
(1792, vol. II), Bishop Percy's "new edition" of this (1801, vol.
II), and in various anthologies such as Chalmers' <hi rend="italic">English
Poets</hi> (1810, vol. XVI) and the Chiswick Press <hi rend="italic">British
Poets</hi> (1822, vol. LXIV).</p></note>

imprinted "for G. Lister, No. 46, Old Bailey, and sold by all
Book-sellers, New's-carriers, &amp;c. in Great Britain and Ireland.
M,DCC,-LXXXVI." Like the collected editions cited in fn. 5, this
has a conglomerate text, but of quite a different kind. At 81-82,
101, 111 it corresponds to Q1; at 67, 108, 184, 315 to Q2; and at
125 and 147 to Q4.</p></note>

Professor Crane (in <hi rend="italic">CBEL,</hi> II, 636-37) as imprinted London
1780 and Edinburgh 1791, but presume that these reproduce the text
carried through 1778. At line 248 in that edition, the earlier
reading "lean to hear" is corrupted to "learn to hear". This
alteration reappears in the separate edition G, in the later
<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> of 1782 and 1784, and in two editions of
<hi rend="italic">Poems,
By

<note id="f006.02.10" place="foot" n="10"><seg type="note-symbol"><hi rend="super">10</hi></seg><p>That there were others now lost may be
inferred from the fact that, whereas the "rare private issues"
(A&mdash;D) are fairly common, only one copy is known of the six
editions E&mdash;H, K, and N. Moreover, between some of these editions
there are considerable intervals, ranging from two to fourteen
years (C to E or D to J), which may have been filled by other
texts. Even for related editions issued in the same year, such as
1775 and F, the designation of the latter as the "Fourth"
presupposes others with earlier edition references. It would seem,
then, that the editions I have found represent only a few of the
many in existence at the time.</p></note>

<note id="f006.02.11" place="foot" n="11"><seg type="note-symbol"><hi rend="super">11</hi></seg><p>The figures normally used by Griffin's
pressmen are 1, 2, and 3. Elisions, occurring frequently throughout
the "Village," cumulate with each successive reprint. For typical
examples of the other alterations, generally evident in all
reprints, observe the hyphenation at 11, 44, 144 (never-failing,
hollow-sounding, a-year) and the modern spelling at 46, 93, 128
(echoes for ecchoes, group for groupe, cheerful for chearful).
Notes on quarto text and paragraph divisions will be found in
Section II.</p></note>

<note id="f006.02.12" place="foot" n="12"><seg type="note-symbol"><hi rend="super">12</hi></seg><p>One edition of Goldsmith's <hi rend="italic">Essays,</hi>

supposedly printed by Griffin, also appears in 12&deg; half-sheets;
but this too, as Professor Friedman has demonstrated (<hi rend="italic">Studies in
Bibliography,</hi> V [1952], 190-193), is doubtless a piracy. The
reading "wo" occurs at lines 162, 316, 346, 374, 394, and 415. It
so reads in all the earlier 12&deg; reprints (A&mdash;E), reverts to
"woe" in the succeeding 8&deg; editions (F, H&mdash;J), and reverts
again to "wo" except at line 374 in the derivative 12&deg; G.</p></note>

<note id="f006.02.13" place="foot" n="13"><seg type="note-symbol"><hi rend="super">13</hi></seg><p>It is not surprising that the year of
Griffin's death should be unknown both to the trade in that day and
to scholars of our time (cf. Morison and Plomer), for it is
unmarked by any obituary even in the newspapers of which he was the
proprietor. It may be noted, though, that his will, proved on June
27, 1775, leaves his estate to his wife Elizabeth (the 'E. Griffin'
cited below); and from the imprints of the two papers he conducted
it may be assumed that he died about June 14. As there is some
little variation in the earlier form of these imprints, the
significance of which is not readily apparent, I reproduce all
versions for both papers through the year 1775.

From this account it would appear that Ayre and Moore occupied the

Saturday, August 26, when they removed the office of the

<note id="f006.02.14" place="foot" n="14"><seg type="note-symbol"><hi rend="super">14</hi></seg><p>Of this a unique copy was once in the
possession of I. A. Williams, and described by him in the <hi rend="italic">London
Mercury,</hi> VI (1922), 633, and in <hi rend="italic">Seven XVIIIth Century
Bibliographies</hi> (1924), pp. 167-68. From the data offered there
it may readily be assumed that, as the four selections (including
Retaliation [6 pages], Edwin and Angelina [6], the Double
Transformation [3&frac23;], and A New Simile [2&frac13;]) occupy exactly
the same amount of space and occur in exactly the same grouping as
in the final gathering of the <hi rend="italic">Works,</hi> all four poems, like
the separate "Village" (F), constitute a reimpression. Further,
both in the <hi rend="italic">Select Poems</hi> and in the separate poem, the
dividing rules in the <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> have been replaced by ornamental

lines. In the <hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> group, however, "Retaliation," appearing
in the <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> as the last of the series of four, was moved to
the first position. Thus the pirate, <hi rend="italic">alias</hi> "Griffin",
ignorantly juggled a poem
which actually belonged to Kearsly, while excluding from this
selection the one poem owned by the man whose imprint he had
assumed.
Even if we condone the infraction of copyright, the multiplicity of
impressions at this late date, and the peculiar styling of their
title-pages, we may not ignore the advertisements for this year,
all of which indicate that the collection the real Griffin had in
press was entirely different from the one offered in these
unannounced <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>. As noted in the issues of his own
<hi rend="italic">Morning Post</hi> for April 18-21, this was to consist, not of
material often printed in earlier years, but of "Poems written by
the late Dr. Goldsmith, David Garrick, Esq. And the Dean of Derry.
Never before published." [Advts. in Griffin's <hi rend="italic">Middlesex
Journal</hi> for April 18-27 read "Others" for "the Dean of Derry."]
Very probably the Goldsmith items were among the papers which
Griffin, as a creditor, seized at the time of the author's death.
Unfortunately, however, as the publisher himself died shortly after
this announcement, his intentions were never fulfilled.</p></note>

<name type="title">The Folio Text of <hi rend="italic">1 Henry
IV</hi></name>
<lb/><hi rend="italic">by</hi><lb/> <name type="author">Alice Walker</name>
</head>

<div2 type="section"><head></head>
<p>In what follows I hope to show what the editorial implications
are of the Folio <hi rend="italic">1 Henry IV</hi> when its variant readings are
considered in relation to its compositors. The authoritative text
for the play is the earliest surviving quarto, printed by Short in
1598 and described traditionally as Q1, but known to be a reprint
of an earlier edition of which only the four leaves of sheet C
survive. Q1 was therefore a derivative print but has substantive
status except for the eight surviving pages of its lost
predecessor. Fortunately these eight pages give good ground for
supposing that Q1 was, in substance, an unusually careful reprint.
Each of Q1's successors was printed from its immediate predecessor
and the Folio text was printed from Q5 (1613). The example of Q5
used for the Folio had been edited to serve as printer's copy in so
far as act and scene divisions had been introduced and some
profanity (though by no means all) had been removed. But although
the Folio corrects
twenty-six of Q5's known errors in the dialogue it is evident from
its legacy of about two hundred errors from Q2-5 that no such
systematic effort had been made to correct the Q5 readings as was
made in preparing quarto copy for the Folio texts of <hi rend="italic">Richard
III, Troilus and Cressida, Lear,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Othello</hi>.
<ref target="f006.03.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref></p>
<p>It is in connection with these four Folio texts that the Folio
variants in <hi rend="italic">1 Henry IV</hi> are important. The quartos which
served as Folio copy for these four plays had been purged of most
of their errors by collation with authoritative playhouse
manuscripts and these four Folio texts should preserve more
authoritative readings than the quartos. But between the corrected
quartos and the Folio an editor has to allow for the Folio
compositors' errors. Some of these are self-evident and their
removal is a simple

<pb n="006.046"/>

matter. What an editor does not know, and cannot determine so
satisfactorily from these texts as from a derivative text, is how
many of the variants were authoritative corrections and how many of
them compositors' errors. The following analysis of the variants in
the Folio <hi rend="italic">1 Henry IV</hi> sheds some light on the question.
<ref target="f006.03.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref></p>
<p>The Folio text of <hi rend="italic">1 Henry IV</hi> runs from p. 46 to p. 73
(d5<hi rend="super">v</hi>&mdash;f6<hi rend="super">r</hi>) of the Histories. What
should have been numbered
p. 47 is numbered p. 49 and the pagination proceeded from this
point without rectification. There are twenty-five and a half pages
of text, of which, by my interpretation of the evidence of their
characteristic spellings, compositor A set eleven pages and
compositor B fourteen and a half. Their stints were as follows:

<table>
<row>
<cell>B d5<hi rend="super">v</hi>-e3<hi rend="super">v</hi></cell>
<cell>(pp. 46-56)</cell>
<cell>I. i.</cell>

<row>
<cell>B f2<hi rend="super">r</hi></cell>

<cell>(pp. 69-73)</cell>
<cell>IV. iv. 27</cell>
<cell>--end</cell>
</row>
</table>

I shall first examine the verbal variants in the dialogue and then
the variants in stage directions. By referring these to the
compositor responsible for them it is easier to see what kind of
alteration may have been made in the example of Q5 used as copy and
what kind of alteration the compositors may have made on their own
account. It will be evident from the above assignments that here,
as elsewhere in the Folio, the stints of the compositors were
governed by mechanical reasons and bear no relation to any literary
considerations or divisions in the text. Hence the division is
textually arbitrary and can serve as pure evidence. What is common
to the work of the compositors may therefore have been in their
copy, but marked discrepancies between the number and character of
the variants in their work are more likely to represent personal
idiosyncrasies.</p>

<pb n="006.047"/>

<p>There are about one hundred and seventy dialogue readings in
which the Folio differs verbally from Q5. Twenty-six of these
variants are almost certainly correct since they restore Q1
readings corrupted in Q2-5. Nine of these readings occur in the
pages set by A; seventeen in the pages set by B. They are as
follows. I give the Folio reading in the first column, italicising
the word or words restored and ignoring Folio italics.

The above Folio readings are accepted by the Cambridge editors,
Dover Wilson, and Alexander. Over another five, opinion is divided,
and I have therefore included them in later lists, indicating by
initials in the appropriate place the editors who have preferred
the Folio reading. We have in this (b) category something like the
distribution of variants between A and B that occurred in list
(a).</p>
<p>With a few possible exceptions, the remaining Folio variants
must be regarded as errors in view of the Folio text's derivative
status; and there can be no doubt that, on an impartial view, this
is indeed what they are. These variants differ strikingly in their
distribution from the readings included in lists (a) and (b), since
there are only eighteen in A's eleven pages but one hundred and
thirteen in B's fourteen and a half.</p>
<p>In the first place, there are only two literal errors in the
pages set by A (one only if the substitution of 'pounds' for
'pound' is regarded as a normalisation), but there are twenty-four
in the pages set by B. I again give the Folio readings in the first
column.

I have not included in this list changes which might be regarded as
legitimate spelling variants (like B's three substitutions of
'whether' for 'whither')<ref target="f006.03.04" n="4"><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref> or
literal errors I know to have been corrected by the
proofreader.</p>
<p>Most of the above are errors of a trivial kind. Unfortunately,
it was not only letters that B added, omitted and altered in
reproducing his copy. Two words are omitted in A's pages (one only
if 'Hart' at III.i.248 had been deleted as an oath); there are
thirty omissions in the pages set by B (thirty-one if the loss of
a biblical allusion at I.ii.86-7 was accidental). I again give the
Folio reading in the first column, indicating the point at which
the word or words were omitted by an asterisk; the second column
records the Q1-5 words omitted.</p>

<p>With this proneness to omit words went a tendency to interpolate
them. There are six interpolations in A's pages. There are
twenty-eight in B's (ignoring the interpolated word at IV.i.17,
possibly supplied by the expurgator to compensate for the loss of
'Zounds' earlier in the line). I quote the Folio and italicise
interpolations.</p>

<p>It is unlikely that all these interpolations were accidental and
it would be tempting to suppose that an editor, rather than the
compositor, was responsible for some of this conjectural bodging,
reminiscent of the patching up of metrically faulty lines in the
Folio <hi rend="italic">Richard III</hi>. The obstacles are that the tendency to
interpolate is just as strong in prose as in verse and that there
is no evidence of a metrical improver's hand in the pages set by A.
Sometimes the Q5 line was halting, but at V.ii.94 the remedy was
not far to seek since the two missing syllables were at the end of
the preceding line. The interpolation of 'wond'rous' in I.iii.277
is particularly suspicious since the fancied need for these two
syllables cannot have occurred until after the compositor had split
the Folio line:

<q>
<l><hi rend="italic">Hot.</hi> I smell it.</l>
<l>Vpon my life, it will do well</l>
</q>

is what was wanted.</p>
<p>It is consequently not surprising that most of the verbal
substitutions

<pb n="006.052"/>

occur in B's pages. There are seven in A's (one a normalisation).
There are twenty-three in B's, not counting a tendency, far more
marked than in A's work, to substitute 'ye' for 'you' and to
introduce elisions more freely. I again give the Folio reading in
the first column.</p>

<p>The distribution of these Folio variants is noticeably more
patchy than that of any group hitherto considered. At first sight
it looks as if an editorial hand had been at work on I.iii, but if
there was editorial tinkering in this scene it seems to have been
singularly pointless. 'I answered indirectly (as I said)', the
quarto line at I.iii.66, is regular and has the briskness
appropriate to Hotspur; 'Made me to answer indirectly (as I said.)'
has nothing to recommend it. An alternative explanation of

<pb n="006.053"/>

this kind of paraphrase (found also at I.iii.27, 128, 133) is loose
memorisation; and a habit of following the matter with the mind
rather than with the eye may explain why it is that we find one
transposition in A's pages but eight in B's and three of them,
perhaps significantly, in I.iii.</p>

It is evident from the above table that if, for the sake of
argument, we were to suppose that all the Folio variants were
introduced by the compositors we should then be forced to conclude
that compositor A succeeded in restoring the correct reading on
certainly nine and probably twelve occasions while introducing only
eighteen errors and, much as one must respect A's normal accuracy,
it seems doubtful whether he would have indulged in speculation so
freely or have proved so shrewd a guesser. From A's work in the
rest of the Histories it would appear that he was by habit
conservative; and it is very likely that, when the veneer of
compositors' spellings and of other normalisations is stripped from
the Folio, the features of the copy will be much clearer in A's
work than in B's. It was, for instance, compositor A who reproduced
the quartos' typographical anomaly ('<hi rend="italic">Rich.</hi> Ha.') in
<hi rend="italic">Richard III,</hi> I.iii.234 and compositor A

<pb n="006.054"/>

who provided one of the strongest links between Q3 and the Folio by
reproducing the 'as as' error at III.i.123. When working in haste
his mistakes might be numerous, but I doubt if at any time he
consciously took liberties with the wording of his copy. It is
especially unlikely that compositor A would have supplied, on his
own initiative, the speech prefixes for Peto and the Prince
(missing from Q1-5) at II.iv.517, 522 or that he would have
substituted the Prince for Gadshill and Gadshill for Russell at
II.iv.166, 167, 169, 173. I judge therefore that, although the
Folio compositors were probably responsible for some of the
corrections in lists (a) and (b),<ref target="f006.03.05" n="5"><hi rend="super">5</hi></ref>
they are unlikely to have been responsible for them all.</p>
<p>The corrections are too few and too haphazard to provide any
clear indication as to when, by whom, or on what authority they
were made. The considerable number of Q5 errors that escaped
correction, as well as the Folio's failure to elucidate cruxes
common to all known quartos, precludes our postulating even a
desultory attempt at collation with a playhouse manuscript, and the
Folio stage directions provide no warrant for supposing that the
quarto had been used as prompt-copy. Nor, apparently, had the
quarto been annotated by someone with a professional interest in
flourishes, hautboys, cornets, and so on, like some of the quartos
used for Folio reprints. At the same time, that the quarto came
from the theatre is probably the inference to be drawn from the
Folio's speech-prefix alterations in II.iv, and casual correction
by someone familiar with the play would explain a few of the Folio
readings in list (a) that seem too acute to be satisfactorily
explained as conjectural: A's
restoration of 'engrosse vp' at III.ii.148, for instance, or B's
restoration of 'fat' at V.iv.107. Nor, in the present state of our
knowledge, can we safely exclude the possibility that the copy was
looked over when it reached Jaggard and conjecturally emended
whenever a manifest breakdown in the sense or metre was noticed.
That the preterite was wanted at II.iv.252 and IV.iii.70 is plain
from the context and what was missing at IV.iv.16 is clear from
IV.iv.14. Corrections like these might have been made
editorially.</p>
<p>Consequently it follows that some of the readings in lists (c)
to (g) were conjectural emendations in the example of Q5, just as
it is possible that some of the corrections in lists (a) and (b)
were due to the compositors' accidental losses, interpolations, and
transpositions. But, whatever we lay to the account of a playhouse
scribbler or an editorial hand,

<pb n="006.055"/>

we cannot bridge the gulf between the number of errors in A's work
and in B's without supposing that an 'improver' happened to have
lost interest in the dialogue of Q5 whenever compositor A chanced
to become responsible for the Folio text; and the unlikelihood that
A's portions of the copy were cleaner than B's is the greater since
we should have to assume that the same thing happened in the case
of Q3 copy for <hi rend="italic">Richard III</hi>. The telltale list of literal
errors in B's pages is, I think, suggestive of habitual
carelessness and the suspicion that compositor B was unusually
prone to take liberties with his copy is confirmed by an
examination of the stage directions.</p>
<p>Q1 was not, on the whole, badly equipped as regards stage
directions, though it certainly lacked the finish that would be
necessary in a promptbook. Its major omissions are not remedied in
the Folio, though trivial alterations are numerous. In the items
included in my first list below there is enough common ground in
the work of the two compositors to make it probable that at least
some of the changes found in the Folio had been made editorially in
their copy.

</p>
<p>The first and second variants in the above list were very
probably due (as Greg suggested) to editorial tinkering, but it is
reasonable to infer that most of the rest of the alterations were
compositor B's since the pages of compositor A contain nothing
comparable. Apart from the two alterations above, compositor A
reproduced verbatim the stage directions of Q5. If there was some
inspection of Folio copy after it reached Jaggard, it follows that
some of the alterations in B's pages may have been editorial, but
we cannot, I think, explain all his alterations in this way,

<pb n="006.057"/>

especially as many of them are so pointless and show the same
tendency to omit, add, and alter words as the variants in the
dialogue set by B. We have here undoubtedly a combination of
carelessness and highhandedness which may matter little in stage
directions but is very serious when the validity of a dialogue
reading is in question, particularly in text for which the Folio's
authority is the higher.</p>
<p>A conscientious proof-reader ought, of course, to have spotted
compositor B's errors and it would be folly to generalise about
Jaggard's proof-reading from the few variant formes exemplified in
facsimiles. The proof-reader was sufficiently on the spot to see
that something was wrong at II.iv.119 (list d), the copy was almost
certainly consulted, and the correction that was made was perhaps
the best that could be done in the circumstances.
<ref target="f006.03.07" n="7"><hi rend="super">7</hi></ref> On the same page
(e3<hi rend="super">v</hi>), if
facsimiles are to be trusted, 'Cop' was corrected to 'Cup' and
'Cowords' to 'Cowards'<ref target="f006.03.08" n="8"><hi rend="super">8</hi></ref>; but
'fatch' for 'fat' and an anomalous 'the' for 'thee' a few lines
lower escaped notice or correction. Though it may be found that in
aggregate the Folio proof-corrections were numerous, it is evident
that, at times at least, the reader's main preoccupation was with
disorders of the most trivial kind and that fidelity to copy did
not enter into consideration. We
have, for instance, in the Staunton and Oxford facsimiles the
uncorrected and corrected versions of p. 71 (f5<hi rend="super">r</hi>), set by
B
(V.ii.79-V.iv.29). The following errors were corrected:

I can see only one principle behind this kind of proof-reading and
it is

<pb n="006.058"/>

not a reassuring one for an editor: it is that a combination of
letters should make a word, but that a combination of words ('Many
a Nobleman likes starke and stiffe', 'Least you retirement do amaze
your friends') need not necessarily make sense.</p>
<p>It is therefore evident that we may find, when surviving copies
of the First Folio have been collated, that an editor has been left
to do much of the work that should have been done by Jaggard's
proof-reader and the many obvious errors on Folio pages which are
known to survive in their corrected state would make it seem
over-optimistic to hope for anything better. The only reasonable
interpretation of the hundred and thirteen errors in B's pages of
the Folio <hi rend="italic">1 Henry IV</hi>, as against eighteen only in A's, is
that they were for the most part due to the compositor's
negligence; and even if we assumed that they included a liberal
contribution of conjectural improvements, made in the copy and
unaccountably concentrated in the parts that it fell to B's lot to
reproduce, editorially the position is no better. If there was
conjectural interference with the copy for one play there may have
been tinkering with the copy for all, and the conjectural
alterations of an erratic improver
are as much a blemish on an edited text as the careless errors of
a compositor. The latter is a serious proposition, but we have at
least the advantage of being able to determine, from the character
of his spelling and from the number of manifest errors in his work,
when we should be particularly on guard; but if we are dealing with
an irresponsible editor, who tinkered unsystematically and on no
ascertainable principles, then the situation is desperate
indeed.</p>
<p>The question is whether we must expect to find errors of this
kind, and in comparable numbers, in other Folio texts. Since the
average number of variants in the dialogue of <hi rend="italic">1 Henry IV</hi> set
by B is close on eight to a page, we are faced with the possibility
that there may be at least two hundred errors in the Folio
<hi rend="italic">Lear</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Othello</hi> for which compositor B was
solely
responsible. Must we assume that these two texts are pitted with
holes and corrupted by interpolations and perversions of the
wording? I think we must and that it is, in any case, plain that
all is not as it should have been in these two texts. There is a
lacuna in the Folio <hi rend="italic">Othello</hi> (a line, phrase, or word omitted
to the detriment of the metre or the sense) on between fifty and
sixty occasions and this is what we should expect to find from the
evidence of <hi rend="italic">1 Henry IV</hi>. The omissions may be even more
numerous in the Folio <hi rend="italic">Lear,</hi> since some allowance must be
made for accidental
omissions in the prompt-book.</p>
<p>We must naturally expect to find some variation in a
compositor's work between one play and another and even between one
page and another. Haste doubtless led to excessive carelessness and
prose must have

<pb n="006.059"/>

been more troublesome than verse, owing to the narrowness of the
Folio column. There are fewer errors in the Folio <hi rend="italic">Richard II</hi>
than in <hi rend="italic">1 Henry IV;</hi> nor is the discrepancy between the
relative accuracy of the two compositors so striking in <hi rend="italic">Richard
II,</hi> though it is clear enough.</p>
<p>Unless the context gives a clear indication of what is wanted,
conservatism is inevitable in the case of Folio plays set from
manuscript. However grave the suspicion of error, it is often wiser
to accept what we have than to emend and run the risk of
substituting one corruption for another. But in the case of plays
printed from corrected quartos we are in a far more fortunate
position. Though the quarto as a whole may have less authority than
its Folio counterpart, by far the majority of the readings in the
quartos of <hi rend="italic">Richard III, Troilus and Cressida, Lear</hi> and
<hi rend="italic">Othello</hi> are not under suspicion. We are therefore not using
these quartos to advantage if we reject what they have to offer
both as a check on the readings of the Folio and as a means of
correcting its errors. The errors can only be weeded out by
bringing to bear on the readings all the relevant literary and
linguistic considerations, but it is a help to know (even if it is
only roughly) how many errors and
what kind of errors a compositor may have introduced.</p>

Walter Greg most kindly provided me with photostats of the Malone
copy of Q5, supplemented by photostats of G1 (defective in Malone)

collation of this quarto with the Oxford facsimile of the First
Folio text and to verify the collation notes of the editions used
(<hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> Hemingway's 1936 Variorum and the 1891-3
Cambridge).
I have found nothing of importance to add to Hemingway's admirably
full and accurate record of Q5 readings, though Q5's 'let them
spake' for 'let them speake' at II.iv.164, 'you' for 'your' at
V.ii.27, and F1's 'hee's' for 'he is' at III.i.233 should perhaps,
in principle, have been recorded. The Malone copy, like the
Jennens-Folger copy, has the uncorrected reading 'would' for 'I
would' at III.iii.85 (see Hemingway's note to III.iii.82 in his
edition). In view of Hemingway's reasonable conclusion that the
Folio text was set up
from a copy of Q5 with all know variant formes in the corrected
state, I have disregarded the uncorrected readings of the Malone
copy ('our' for 'your' at II.ii.64, 'would' for 'I would' at
III.iii.85, and 'though' for 'thought' at IV.i. 2). In the present

disregarded the Folio corrections (both compositor A's) of a
duplicated word ('of of') at III.i.149 and an interpolated word
('tell', caught from the previous line) at IV.ii.56, since both of
the Q5 errors would have been corrected by an attentive

may soon be possible.<ref target="f006.04.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref> When a
great
many of the surviving copies of the Folio have been carefully
collated throughout, so that we can be quite sure that at least
most, if not all, of the variants produced in the course of the
printing have been discovered and recorded&mdash;only then can we hope
to reconstruct the full story of the proof-reading and stop-press
correction that took place in Jaggard's shop during the printing of
the volume. And only then can all of the editorial implications of
the facts thus brought to light be properly understood.</p>
<p>Few, therefore, save the most tentative of conclusions can at
present be advanced as to the ultimate bibliographical and textual
import of the variants in the First Folio. But the detailed
collation of a mere twenty copies through about a third of the
volume has already turned up variants in great abundance; and
certain observations may here be made, if only to suggest some of
the possible implications latent in one small group of variant
readings that are evidently characteristic of some parts of the
First Folio&mdash;and as evidently <hi rend="italic">not</hi> characteristic of other

parts. A convenient point of departure for these observations is
offered by a newly found proof-sheet for one page in <hi rend="italic">Romeo and
Juliet</hi>.</p>

<pb n="006.062"/>

<p>Three First Folio proof-sheets have hitherto been known, and may
be briefly reviewed as follows.</p>
<p>I. Proof-readers' marks calling for some 19 changes in one page
of <hi rend="italic">Antony and Cleopatra</hi> appear on the verso of a now
disjunct single leaf from what was once the full sheet XXI:6. An
examination of the 38 First Folios presently available for study at
the Folger Shakespeare Library reveals: (a) that two of these 38
copies, some 5%, show the uncorrected state of XX6<hi rend="super">v</hi>
(page 352);
and (b) that the conjugate forme-page, XXI<hi rend="super">v</hi> (page 341),
is
invariant.</p>

<p>II. Folger First Folio No. 47 shows marks on VV3<hi rend="super">r</hi>
(p. 333, in
<hi rend="italic">Othello</hi>) calling for nine corrections. One of the errors
here marked must have required the proof-reader to consult his
"copy": correction called for the substitution of one whole line
for a very different one in the earlier state. Four of the 79
Folger copies, again about 5%, show the uncorrected state of both
pages of the forme (VV3<hi rend="super">r</hi>:4<hi rend="super">v</hi>), though
neither Copy No. 47 nor
any other shows proof-reader's marks on VV4<hi rend="super">v</hi> (page
336).</p>
<p>III. Folger No. 48 has marks on qq6<hi rend="super">v</hi> (p. 292, in
<hi rend="italic">Lear</hi>)
requiring five corrections. The uncorrected state appears in about
7% of the Folger copies. The other forme-page (qq1<hi rend="super">r</hi>, p.
381, in
<hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi>) is variant, but no Folger copy showing the earlier
state of this page is marked for correction.
<ref target="f006.04.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref></p>
<p>A fourth set of proof-reader's marks has now come to light.
Forme ff1<hi rend="super">v</hi>:6<hi rend="super">r</hi> (pages 62 and 71) in
<hi rend="italic">Romeo and Juliet</hi>
exists in two states. Nos. 24, 26, 38, 50, and 79 of the
thirty-eight Folger copies at present in the Folger Library show
the uncorrected state; and the two errors that characterize this
state of ff6<hi rend="super">r</hi> (p. 71) are marked for correction in Folger
No. 50
(see Cut I). The variant readings of the forme are as follows
(uncorrected states first; positions identified by page-number,
column, and line in the Folio and within parentheses by act, scene,
and line in the Globe edition):

<list>
<item>p. 62, col. b, line 5 (II, iv, 124) [qua-/] th
aGentleman:</item>
<item>                                    [qua-/] t
ha:Gentlemen,</item>
<item>p. 71, col. a, line 8 (IV, i, 37)   own</item>
<item>                                    now</item>
<item>p. 71, col. b, line 38 (IV, ii, 2)  Coekes</item>
<item>                                    Cookes</item>
</list>

<pb n="006.063"/>

On page 62, three kinds of alterations are made. "Gentleman" is
made plural and both the spacing and the punctuation are changed.
Yet we have in essence only one variant <hi rend="italic">reading</hi> here: the
good Angelica, having first reacted to the previous speech by
Romeo, is made by the correction to begin with a properly
deferential salutation the question that she now addresses to all
three of the gentlemen before her. Although the corrected reading
is substantially that of the copy from which the Folio text was
set, the Quarto of 1609, the change almost certainly reflects only
the independent authority of the proof-reader. (Had copy been
consulted, the errors in the line above would doubtless have been
mended as well.) The corruption of the first setting is only a
little less simple and obvious than that in the two readings that
were corrected in the other forme-page.</p>
<p>As in the two other instances in which the marked page appears
in an extant Folio, the <hi rend="italic">Romeo and Juliet</hi> leaf bearing the
proof-reader's marks has its normal conjugate and the whole sheet
was evidently bound into the volume in a perfectly regular manner,
like any unmarked sheet. And as in both the other instances the
conjugate forme-page is characterized by a single reading that was
corrected, although the error was not marked for correction in the
copy that served as proof for the other page of the forme. Thus, it
will be observed, we now have further confirmation for the
hypothesis first advanced in 1942:<ref target="f006.04.03" n="3"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref>
that, in effect, <hi rend="italic">the proof-reading unit</hi> for at least some
parts of the First Folio was normally the single page, though
<hi rend="italic">the correction unit</hi> was of course the forme, both pages of
which were ordinarily corrected in a single unlocking
operation.</p>
<p>But the present proof-sheet is chiefly of interest for other
reasons and in conjunction with other evidence of the kind of
proof-reading to which <hi rend="italic">Romeo and Juliet</hi> was subject. The
factors that differentiate the press-correction of <hi rend="italic">Romeo and
Juliet</hi> from what we find (or fail to find) elsewhere in the
volume may prove, indeed, to be far more significant than the
common factors.</p>
<p>It may be remarked, first of all, that the evidence for
identifying ff6<hi rend="super">r</hi> in Folger No. 50 as in fact a proof-sheet
is
anything but abundant. The errors marked, and those alone, were the
ones corrected, to be sure; and that the marks on the <hi rend="italic">Romeo and
Juliet</hi> page (see Cut I) were the standard symbols for
indicating transpositions and obvious single-letter errors is made
perfectly clear by the repeated uses of the same marks for such
errors in the other proof-sheets. (See Cut III for examples in the
<hi rend="italic">Antony and Cleopatra</hi> proof-sheet of both kinds of marks that

appear in the <hi rend="italic">Romeo</hi> sheet. Cut II shows the corrected state
of p. 71; Cuts IV and V

show the uncorrected and corrected states of p. 62.) Yet the ink of
the <hi rend="italic">Romeo</hi> proof-marks is now darker than that found in all
the other proof-sheets; the transposition mark is not, as
elsewhere, marginal; and there is some slight difference in the
form of this symbol here and on p. 352 in <hi rend="italic">Antony</hi>.
<ref target="f006.04.04" n="4"><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref> That these marks in <hi rend="italic">Romeo
and
Juliet</hi> and those found in the other proof-sheets were made by
different hands obviously cannot be maintained on the basis of such
evidence; but the suspicion here bred is fostered by various other
considerations.</p>
<p>Certainly it is rather surprising, to begin with, that so many
copies show the uncorrected state of
ff1<hi rend="super">v</hi>:6<hi rend="super">r</hi>&mdash;five out of
38, nearly one copy in every seven: something over 13%. This
phenomenon might, of course, be supposed the result of mere chance,
except that it is encountered elsewhere in <hi rend="italic">Romeo and Juliet</hi>.
Variant forme ee3<hi rend="super">r</hi>:4<hi rend="super">v</hi> is found
uncorrected in five copies out
of 37; ff2<hi rend="super">r</hi>:5<hi rend="super">v</hi> in four; and uncorrected
ee2<hi rend="super">v</hi>:5<hi rend="super">r</hi> in 21
out of 36 copies, almost 60%. Certainly, it would seem, there was
no very eager concern in Jaggard's shop over the errors that might
mar large numbers of the copies of the finished book in <hi rend="italic">Romeo
and Juliet;</hi> for it is manifest that the proof-reading for this
play was frequently not undertaken until long after the first pulls
on a new forme had begun to come off the press. And this lack of
concern is reflected also by the small number and inferior quality
of the corrections that at length were made&mdash;and by the hosts of
errors, many of them apparent at a glance, that yet remain in the
"corrected" pages of this play, not to mention new error sometimes
introduced in the very process of correction.</p>
<p>One of the most striking things about the <hi rend="italic">Romeo and
Juliet</hi> proof-sheet, of course, is that it marks only two small
errors for correction; and we have seen that only one reading was
corrected in the other page of the same forme. This kind of thing
is not invariably characteristic of the variant formes in <hi rend="italic">Romeo
and Juliet,</hi> but it is certainly the general rule. One forme
(ee3<hi rend="super">v</hi>:4<hi rend="super">r</hi>) shows fourteen variants in one
and eleven variants
on the other of its two pages. Throughout the rest of the play,
however, the largest number of corrections in any single page now
known to be variant is a mere three; and four of these pages have
but one correction each. Combined, moreover, with this paucity of
individual variants is a startling abundance of variant pages. A
collation of only twenty copies has turned up 12 variant pages out
of the 25 pages of the play; and it is not impossible that we may
eventually discover that every single page of the Folio text of
<hi rend="italic">Romeo and
Juliet</hi> was subjected to stop-press correction.
<ref target="f006.04.05" n="5"><hi rend="super">5</hi></ref>

<pb n="006.067"/>

The treatment accorded <hi rend="italic">Romeo and Juliet</hi> during the printing
of the First Folio seems to have been characterized, therefore, by
a great deal of rather tardy proof-reading that resulted in very
few actual corrections.<ref target="f006.04.06" n="6"><hi rend="super">6</hi></ref></p>
<p>The remarkable contrast between this kind of treatment and the
kind accorded the plays immediately before and after <hi rend="italic">Romeo and
Juliet</hi> in the Folio (<hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> and then <hi rend="italic">Titus
Andronicus</hi> precede; <hi rend="italic">Timon, Julius Caesar,</hi> and
<hi rend="italic">Macbeth</hi> follow) is perhaps best pointed up by the following
three facts:

<list>
<item>(1) The first two and a half leaves of the ee quire of the
First Folio contain the last five pages of <hi rend="italic">Titus Andronicus,
Romeo and Juliet</hi> beginning on ee3<hi rend="super">r</hi>. Hence each
of four
formes of the ee quire contains one page of <hi rend="italic">Titus</hi> and one of
<hi rend="italic">Romeo</hi>. Now every variant forme throughout
<hi rend="italic">Romeo</hi> in
which <hi rend="italic">both</hi> pages contain <hi rend="italic">Romeo</hi> text is variant
in
<hi rend="italic">both</hi> pages of the pair. But two of the twelve variant pages
of <hi rend="italic">Romeo,</hi> ee5<hi rend="super">r</hi> and ee6<hi rend="super">r</hi>,
are in formes shared by
<hi rend="italic">Romeo</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Titus</hi>. In each of these cases the
<hi rend="italic">Titus</hi> text is invariant, correction having been
confined&mdash;at least in the copies so far collated&mdash;to
<hi rend="italic">Romeo and
Juliet</hi>.<ref target="f006.04.07" n="7"><hi rend="super">7</hi></ref></item>

<item>(2) The collation of twenty First Folios, though revealing
numerous variant pages in <hi rend="italic">Romeo and Juliet,</hi> discovers not
a
single variant in <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus,</hi> only four variant pages in
<hi rend="italic">Titus,</hi> no variants whatever in <hi rend="italic">Timon,</hi> four
variant
pages in <hi rend="italic">Julius Caesar,</hi> and one variant page in
<hi rend="italic">Macbeth:</hi> a total of nine variant pages in these five whole
plays as compared with twelve in <hi rend="italic">Romeo and Juliet</hi> alone
(though there are a few more individual variants in the nine pages
than in the twelve).<ref target="f006.04.08" n="8"><hi rend="super">8</hi></ref></item>

<item>(3) Perhaps most clearly indicative of the kind of
printing-house treatment accorded <hi rend="italic">Romeo and Juliet</hi> in
contrast with that given most of the plays just before and just
after it in the Folio is the inferior quality of the

<pb n="006.068"/>

<hi rend="italic">Romeo</hi> text notwithstanding the relatively large number of
its pages now known to have been proof-read and corrected.</item>
</list>
</p>
<p>On this last point the present writer can speak only with "a
scattering and unsure observance," for he is by no means expert on
the texts of the first six tragedies in the folio. Yet he could not
fail to notice, while collating these plays, that <hi rend="italic">Romeo and
Juliet</hi> is peculiar in the abundance of obvious error that both
its corrected and its uncorrected states show&mdash;and which, indeed,
seems sometimes to infect the very process of correction itself.
The proof-page, for example, shows the correction of two small
mistakes but leaves unmarked and uncorrected at least a dozen
others where corruption is just as evident. Column <hi rend="italic">a</hi> alone
has, among others:

<list>
<item>God&longs;heild: I      for  God&longs;hield I</item>

<item>&longs;treames           "   &longs;traines</item>

<item>heart, and         "   heart and</item>

<item>&longs;tay               "   &longs;lay</item>

<item>thinglike          "   think like</item>

<item>Fro of             "   From of</item>

<item>chappels           "   chapless</item>
</list>

And most of these errors originated in the Folio: only two of the
seven are present in the copy, the Quarto of 1609.</p>
<p>The other page of the forme is about equally corrupt. Even its
one variant speech illustrates the carelessness and incompletenes
of the proof-reading to which it was subject; for although the
second line of the speech is corrected&mdash;except that the spacing is
never made quite right (see Cuts IV and V)&mdash;the comma after "to"
in the line above should patently come after "mar"; and it is
almost as apparent that a word has been omitted before "&longs;aid" (Q
1609 has "well &longs;aid"). Probably, too, the final letter of this
line should be an "o" rather than an "a", though here the copy is
accurately represented. Again, the single correction made in p. 70
(ff5<hi rend="super">v</hi>) is of a minor error in spacing&mdash;"bo&longs;om
ehenceforth"
for "bo&longs;ome henceforth", as in the Quarto&mdash;yet numerous equally
obvious and scarcely more trifling mistakes remain:

<list>
<item>bowles     for       bowle</item>

<item>ride        "        tide</item>

<item>&longs;traue      "        &longs;tarue</item>

<item>Hlacke      "        Alacke</item>

<item>talke      <hi rend="italic">for</hi>       talk'd [probably; though here
F=Q]</item>

<item>Benig       "        Being</item>
</list>

&mdash;to mention only a few, and only one that is derived from the
Quarto. Even the page that shows fourteen variants (ee3<hi rend="super">v</hi>,
p. 54)
still shows in its corrected state a good many obvious errors not
found in the copy:

<pb n="006.069"/>

<list>
<item>others       <hi rend="italic">for</hi>  other</item>

<item>Love,is       "  Love is</item>

<item><hi rend="italic">Be. n</hi>         "  <hi rend="italic">Ben.</hi></item>

<item>henec         "  hence</item>
</list>

among several others. And beside such failures to correct at all
may be set examples of failure to correct correctly. In variant
page 74 (gg1<hi rend="super">v</hi>) "Tortyrs" is changed to
"Tortoyrs"&mdash;the word
"Tortoys" [ tortoise], as in the Quarto, having been intended.
An "o" was rightly added after the second "t" but the absurd second
"r" of the original setting was not removed. Whether the marker of
the proof-sheet for this page was as much at fault as the
"correcting" compositor we can only guess. Finally, in page 55
(ee4<hi rend="super">r</hi>) the line

<q>
<l>And &longs;he &longs;hall &longs;cant &longs;hell, well, that now &longs;hewes
best.</l>
</q>

becomes

<q>
<l>And &longs;he &longs;hew &longs;cant &longs;hell, well, that now &longs;hewes
best.</l>
</q>

where what was intended was evidently

<q>
<l>And &longs;he &longs;hall &longs;cant &longs;hew well, that now &longs;hewes
best.</l>
</q>

(This is the reading of the Quarto, where, however, part of the
spacequad between "&longs;hew" and "well" is slightly inked. This inked
spacequad does not look much like a comma, but the Folio compositor
seems to have been scarcely more alert when he set this line than
when he corrected it.) Our proof-reader doubtless indicated that
the word "&longs;hew" was to be substituted for the "&longs;hell," of the
first setting; but it was substituted for the similar "&longs;hall" two
words earlier instead. Here, surely the compositor nodded badly;
though again it is possible that the over-casual marks of the
proof-reader contributed to the ultimate muddle. In any event it is
clear that the proof-reading of this line only produced, at last,
a reading even worse than the one originally set.</p>
<p>We have been considering, of course, only errors of the simplest
kinds, those due as a rule to the minor lapses of a compositor.
Obscure and complex errors, and corruptions resulting either from
the peculiarities of the copy or from the more serious failures of
the compositor, have not been in question (nor were, evidently, to
the <hi rend="italic">Romeo</hi> proof-reader); and it should be remembered that
a
text quite free of obvious errors may yet be very corrupt&mdash;though
it seems but reasonable to suppose that type-setting that is full
of small errors is likely to contain large ones as well.
<ref target="f006.04.09" n="9"><hi rend="super">9</hi></ref> Hence

<pb n="006.070"/>

the phenomena described above do not of themselves provide any
sound basis for final conclusions as to the essential qualities of
the texts of the six plays mentioned. But the phenomena are
nevertheless suggestive. The plays just before and just after
<hi rend="italic">Romeo and Juliet</hi> in the First Folio exhibit no such
abundance of obvious error as we find here&mdash;nor so many variant
formes; nor such large numbers of copies showing the uncorrected
states of these variant formes; nor so much evidence that the
proof-reading was characteristically as careless as it was tardy;
nor such signs of badly executed correction. To some extent the
typesetting, but above all the proof-reading that went into the
Folio text of <hi rend="italic">Romeo and Juliet,</hi> is of a special order,
clearly differentiating this play from most of the plays nearby. A
particular <hi rend="italic">attitude</hi> toward the <hi rend="italic">Romeo</hi> text would

seem
to have prevailed in the printing-house during the preparation of
this play for the Folio&mdash;as if the
compositor and the proof-reader alike, though having their jobs to
do, were somehow unable to discharge their appointed tasks with
their usual conscientiousness&mdash;as if they were but too well aware
that they were here perpetuating only the reprint of a reprint of
the play.</p>
<p>As I insisted at the beginning of this paper, it would be
imprudent to infer from the variant readings of the First Folio so
far known any but very tentative conclusions. The evidence that has
been presented will serve at least to indicate that different plays
were treated with very different degrees of care in Jaggard's shop
during the printing of the First Folio, the relative attentiveness
of the proof-reader<ref target="f006.04.10" n="10"><hi rend="super">10</hi></ref> being one of
the significant variables. Perhaps it will indicate also that a
study of <hi rend="italic">all</hi> of the Folio's variants, when these have at
length been found, may have a good deal to teach us, not alone as
bibliographers and students of printing-house practices and
techniques, but also as editors of the various plays of
Shakespeare. And, finally, a very specific suggestion may be made.
The conjecture was hazarded above (see note 8) that at least some
of the plays printed for the Folio from manuscript copy were given
much more careful
treatment than were certain other plays that were set, like
<hi rend="italic">Romeo and Juliet,</hi> from printed copy. The basis for this
inference is admittedly not yet very solid: it consists in part in
the mere scarcity of variants so far discovered in such plays as
<hi rend="italic">Coriolanus, Timon,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Macbeth</hi>. But let no
prospective editor of <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus,</hi> for example, forthwith
conclude that the Folio text of this play is not only remarkably
good but also invariant. For if variants turn up, as they probably
will, they may prove more interesting than those minor tidyings-up
so characteristic of <hi rend="italic">Romeo and Juliet</hi>. As in other things,
the rarer the more likely to be valuable.</p>

<hi rend="italic">Romeo</hi>.</p></note>

<p>Though definition of terms is dull work, any paper which
attempts to discuss bibliographical method had better state what it
means by that phrase, for of all modern terms for scholarly
disciplines, 'bibliography' is perhaps the loosest used and the
least understood. From among the various subdivisions of
bibliography, two have the greatest bearing on the problems of
Shakespeare's text. The first is <hi rend="italic">analytical,</hi> or, as it is
often called, <hi rend="italic">critical bibliography</hi>. This I take to be the
technical investigation of the printing of specific books, or of
general printing practise, based exclusively on the physical
evidence of the books themselves. Such a line of investigation may
detect and explain cancels and reprinted substituted sheets of all
kinds. It is especially concerned with the presswork of a book, and
it may explain by the use of mechanical evidence the number of
presses engaged on a book, the order of the formes through the
press, the printing together as one
sheet of widely separated leaves, or the assignment of parts in a
book broken up and printed simultaneously in sections. In Sir
Walter Greg's phrase, it treats a book not as a literary document
but simply as a <hi rend="italic">tangible object</hi> produced by a physical
process. The evidence the method employs is correspondingly
physical, and the ideal is to build up a case which could be taken
to a court of law for a favorable verdict. This is <hi rend="italic">analytical
bibliography</hi> in its purest sense.</p>
<p>Two illustrations may be given of its operations on Shakespeare
problems. The first is the famous case of the 1619 Shakespeare
editions which were falsely dated reprints, the so-called <hi rend="italic">Pavier
quartos</hi>. By a magnificent piece of bibliographical detective
work in analysis, Greg and Neidig first showed, on the mechanical
evidence of the similarity in watermarked

<pb n="006.072"/>

paper and the fact that there was standing type in the title-pages,
that these editions&mdash;which purported to have been printed at
widely varying dates&mdash;were in truth manufactured continuously at
one time, some years after the dates alleged on various titles. The
importance of this discovery for Shakespearian textual criticism
cannot be over-estimated. Since the dates on some of these quartos
were the same as those for authentic first editions, scholars, who
had previously been able to operate only by what critical acumen
they possessed, had in some cases confused the correct order and
had set up one or more of these late and unauthoritative reprints
as the true first edition of the very highest textual authority.
Although there had not been complete unanimity of opinion in this
matter, there was no method by which critical judgment could
positively demonstrate the correct order. Yet Greg's mechanical
evidence could have been taken into a court of law. His
case&mdash;being
bibliographical in an analytical sense &mdash;could and did positively
demonstrate the correct order by physical evidence admitting no
further controversy. At one stroke questions of the relative order
and authority of a number of texts were settled once and for
all.</p>
<p>My second illustration has no such far-reaching consequences,
but it is an especially neat example of how strict analytical
bibliography can clarify muddied waters. The quarto of
Shakespeare's <hi rend="italic">Troilus and Cressida</hi> exists in two forms. In
one, the title-page is conjugate in its gathering, and on it the
play is stated to have been acted at the Globe. In the other this
title-page is cancelled and is replaced by two leaves in a fold. On
the first leaf, a new title-page omits reference to this public
acting. An anonymous preface appears on the second leaf, which
somewhat offensively, perhaps, denies that the play was ever
publicly acted and hints that it is now being printed against the
wishes of the 'grand possessors.' In the first investigations, the
order of these two title-pages was confused and the true first was
thought to be a correction of the second. However, the physical
facts of cancellation and substitution were soon discovered to set
that right&mdash;a piece of
analytical bibliography in itself. Thereafter, it was automatically
assumed that a considerable time-lag intervened between the
printing of the first form and of its cancel substitute; and on the
basis of this assumption a number of rather fantastic theories were
evolved to explain the reasons for the printing of the new title
and the preface.</p>
<p>What exact circumstances lie behind the situation we still do
not know as clearly as we should like, perhaps, but of one thing we
may now be certain: the substitute title and preface were not added
to the play some time after publication as a result of any set of
hypothetical circumstances. Dr. Philip Williams has been able to
show by purely mechanical evidence,

<pb n="006.073"/>

analyzing the running-titles for what they demonstrate must have
been the method of printing, that the two cancel leaves were
printed as an integral part of the last sheet of the text, the full
sheet then being cut apart and its two halves designed one to go at
the beginning and the other at the end of the quarto. This physical
demonstration does not, it is true, explain the curious statements
in the preface&mdash;since these are not susceptible to attack by
bibliographical evidence&mdash;but it has the virtue of severely
limiting the scope of future theories by establishing that the play
had not been published when the change was decided upon, and that
less than a fortnight could have elapsed between the physical
printing of the first title and the decision to cancel it in favor
of the substitute halfsheet. Whatever explanation for the anomaly
that is to be offered, therefore, must not overstep the limits set
by these two pieces of evidence.</p>
<p>It is of importance to notice that analytical bibliography in
treating a book as a tangible object deliberately operates without
regard for the meaning of the text contained in the book. This is
not purblindness but instead a logical and necessary restriction of
the discipline to its proper mechanical evidence. I may illustrate
with an example of a reading from <hi rend="italic">Richard II</hi>. If one is
investigating the history of its text the first problem that arises
when one comes to the third edition is whether this Q3 was printed
from Q1 or from Q2. There happens to be sufficient textual
evidence, but in fact A. W. Pollard pointed out one piece of
bibliographical proof which needs no further corroboration. In a
particular line the word <hi rend="italic">for</hi> appears clearly printed in Q1;
in Q2 the word is again <hi rend="italic">for,</hi> but the <hi rend="italic">f</hi> is very
faintly inked. The compositor of Q3 overlooked this faint <hi rend="italic">f</hi>
and printed the word as <hi rend="italic">or</hi>. Trivial as the example is, it
has important
implications for method. The point is this. If we were to rely on
meaning only, no evidence could be adduced. The word <hi rend="italic">or</hi>
instead of <hi rend="italic">for</hi> is clearly wrong, but it could have occurred
as a simple misprint if Q1 had been the copy. But without regard
for rightness or wrongness, we can demonstrate, on this one piece
of evidence alone, that Q2 was the copy because the faint inking of
the letter <hi rend="italic">f</hi> provides a mechanical reason for its omission
in Q3. A more pertinent use of this sort of evidence comes in
Dryden's <hi rend="italic">Wild Gallant</hi> where it alone is sufficient to decide
the difficult question of priority for the first and second
editions printed in the same year. Here, in one edition, only the
tip of a letter <hi rend="italic">l</hi> inked, producing a mark that could easily
be mistaken for an apostrophe. And as an apostrophe it appears in
the other edition. A court of law would accept this evidence, for
to reverse it one would be forced to argue that in a first edition
the
compositor set an apostrophe and in the second another compositor
in the same place set an imperfect letter <hi rend="italic">l</hi> which inked so
as to resemble an apostrophe. I should not myself care to be
briefed for such a defense.</p>

<pb n="006.074"/>

<p>I have spent time on these examples because they may assist
somewhat when we come to the second branch of bibliography of which
I spoke&mdash;this is <hi rend="italic">textual bibliography</hi>. Since it may
often
occur that there is a difficulty in drawing a sharp line between
textual and analytical bibliography in specific cases, I offer a
rather over-simplified definition at the start. I take it that
textual bibliography is the application of the evidence of
analytical bibliography, or at least of its pertinent methods, to
textual problems where meaning of some sort may be involved even
though very slightly. Or if, in the strictest possible sense,
meaning is not involved, textual bibliography deals with printing
evidence which&mdash;in ordinary contrast to analytical
bibliography&mdash;relies on cumulation for building up its case, and
on some degree of interpretation. Because it is a form of
bibliography, the textual method must still firmly base itself on
the evidence of the printing process but it
may associate palaeographical evidence with this, as well as
evidence of any sort that seems pertinent. The nearer it approaches
to analytical bibliography the more certain and mechanically
demonstrable are its results; the farther it dissociates itself,
the more its evidence becomes speculative, cumulative in its
effect, and in need of interpretation. Very much in general,
analytical bibliography has a tendency to find its normal material
in larger questions of fact, whereas textual bibliography
ultimately attempts to apply its findings to specific and even
minute points. The field is so very broad that generalisations are
difficult and I had better proceed to examples.</p>
<p>Before any logical approach could be made to the problem of the
<hi rend="italic">King Lear</hi> text, not only did the Pavier quarto need to be
cleared out of the way as having any authority, but also the
precise relationship of the first quarto and folio texts had to be
established. By relationship I mean specifically their tangible
relationship: was the Folio text printed from a manuscript or was
it printed from an annotated copy of the first quarto. On the
answer to this question hinges the entire logical approach one must
take to the variants between the two texts in general, as well as
in any specific reading. It happens that there is evidence which is
at least on the fringes of the bibliographical method, that is,
evidence of the Folio making a wrong rationalization in an attempt
to ungarble a quarto corruption. In <hi rend="italic">King Lear</hi> an example
comes at II.iv.100 where in its unproofread state the first quarto
read, "the dear father | Would with his daughter speak; come and
tends service".
The Folio, struggling with this unsatisfactory passage, changed
"come and tends service" to the scarcely more satisfactory
"commands, tends, service". "Commands her service" is of course the
right reading as found in the proofread state of the quarto; the
point here is simply that the Folio error can be explained only on
the basis that the quarto error served as printer's copy. Another

<pb n="006.075"/>

example of what I mean comes from <hi rend="italic">Richard II</hi>. Line I.i.77
reads in the first quarto, "What I have spoke or thou canst worse
devise." Q2 corrupted the line by omitting 'worse' and reading,
"What I have spoke or thou canst devise." The Q3 compositor mended
the metre by adding 'what' to make the line read smoothly, "What I
have spoke or what thou canst devise." This form for some reason
was altered in the Folio by omitting the 'what' and changing
'spoke' to 'spoken': "What I have spoken or thou canst devise."
Here the chain of rationalization is clear, as we see compositors
or editors reconstructing a defective line according to their own
tastes. Or one can illustrate further with the incorrect Folio "had
his current" at V.iii.63, the result of the compositor's
bewilderment at the spelling 'hald' in the "hald [<hi rend="italic">or</hi> 'held']
his current" of his copy.</p>
<p>It is true that these Folio variants are readily explained by
our ability to trace the printing of the text through its various
forms. To this extent the method is bibliographical, but it is
somewhat remotely so perhaps in contrast to the truly
bibliographical form which the clinching evidence took. The first
quarto of <hi rend="italic">King Lear</hi> was very considerably proof-corrected
during the course of its printing so that all but a few sheets
exist in two states of the readings. That the Folio was definitely
printed not from any original manuscript but at least basically
from a copy of the quarto became clear when P. A. Daniel, and later
Sir Walter Greg, pointed out that in some instances the Folio text
follows the uncorrected readings of certain quarto sheets, as with
"commands, tends" for "come and tends," an impossible occurrence
for a text set from an author's manuscript since these readings
must have been copies of the blunders and misreadings of the Q1
compositor. This is very
close indeed to mechanical proof, and the example places textual
bibliography as near to analytical as it can come.
<ref target="f006.05.01a" n="*"><hi rend="super">*</hi></ref> Somewhat similar investigations
in
Shakespeare are those of Philip Williams with <hi rend="italic">Troilus and
Cressida,</hi> and Charlton Hinman with <hi rend="italic">Othello</hi>. In the
one
case such printing evidence as the common variable use of italic or
roman type for names, as well as the forms taken by the speech
headings, settled the long-vexed question of the relation of the
Folio <hi rend="italic">Troilus</hi> to the quarto by showing beyond doubt that the
Folio was indeed set from a copy of the quarto and not from a
manuscript. In the

<pb n="006.076"/>

other, similar typographical evidence established that in
<hi rend="italic">Othello</hi> the Q2 passages of added text, first found in the
Folio, were set from the Folio and not from another manuscript.
This latter I believe offers a splendid example of the certainty of
the bibliographical method when operating on its proper forms of
evidence as against the uncertainty of the critical method. So long
as the case was considered only from the critical point of view,
doubt existed whether the variants in the Q2 text from the text in
the Folio were not the result of printing from different copy, a
manuscript. And in fact I believe I am correct in stating that
every text available today actually takes over one or more of these
Q2 variants, as representing an actual recovery of what Shakespeare
really wrote. Yet Dr. Hinman, using mechanical evidence from the
printing, has proved beyond any doubt that Q2 is a mere reprint of
the Folio for the added passages and that no reading from it can
have any
independent authority whatsoever. The bibliographical method, here,
shows that criticism&mdash;with all its positive virtues&mdash;can indeed
be fallible.</p>
<p>But I am not interested today in listing the various horrid
examples in Shakespeare in which bibliography has exposed the
errors of what Sir Walter Greg calls 'metacritical' writers. I do
want, however, to pursue a little more narrowly some differences
between true bibliography and psuedo-bibliography, because this
pseudo-bibliography has sometimes masqueraded as the real thing in
Shakespearian textual criticism.
<ref target="f006.05.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref></p>
<p>Earlier I emphasized that to be called textual bibliography the
method of investigation must be firmly rooted in the printing
process; and I distinguished between analytical bibliography in
which the evidence is not textual&mdash;at least in the purest state of
analytical bibliography&mdash;and textual bibliography in which the
chief concern is with the printing of the text as such, and the
evidence is therefore drawn from the text and its characteristics
although still in a largely mechanical manner. I can illustrate
now, I believe, with a concrete example which may be of assistance.
If a book were set by more than one compositor, it is of the
highest importance to distinguish the exact pages composed by each
workman, for each in all probability will have adopted somewhat
different attitudes towards the text and, at the least, each will
have imposed upon the author's manuscript somewhat different
spelling and punctuational characteristics. Analytical bibliography
has one certain
method for making

<pb n="006.077"/>

this distinction on purely mechanical grounds, although the method,
unfortunately, works better for Restoration than for Elizabethan
times, reflecting the difference between the fixed and the
adjustable composing sticks. If one compositor takes over from
another and does not have a stick of exactly the same length in
which he sets the lines of type, the close measurement of the
variant width of the type-page will infallibly detect the presence
of these two workmen using slightly different setting sticks. This
is mechanical evidence at its purest, and it is certainly
analytical bibliography. Textual bibliography, using evidence based
on the physical features of the text as such, may also distinguish
the presence of more than one compositor by its own methods.
Differences in the typographical characteristics of act and scene
headings, of stage directions, of turned-over versus split lines of
verse, of the setting of proper names, and of the forms of
speech-prefixes have all been used
with success in the dramatic texts. Of a different nature is a
spelling analysis which classifies the variable habits of
compositors and assigns different favorite methods of spelling the
same word or similar groups of words as a distinction. Each
bibliographical method employs the printing process though in
different ways.</p>
<p>Now what I wish to point out specifically is that while the
results may in some degree be inferential and cumulative, for
textual bibliography, since the evidence is based on the variable
and sometimes unpredictable characteristics of human beings as they
perform their tasks, as against the result from the printer's stick
which bases its evidence on a piece of equipment in the printer's
shop; nevertheless, actual and physical evidence is employed, and
inferences are drawn from a very large body of cumulative evidence,
not&mdash;as with pseudo-bibliography&mdash;from mere speculations as
to
what might have happened in the course of printing. In other words,
true bibliography even in its inferences building up to an
hypothesis&mdash;I dare say even in its occasional
speculations&mdash;must
govern itself by laws of evidence of a nature very similar to those
which govern a Queen's Counsel in court. These laws of evidence, I
take it, concern the logical process by which a chain of
ascertained facts
is linked together to show a certain relation between presumed
cause and indubitable effect. Circumstantial evidence welds these
links together. In some cases time may show that because of certain
missing evidence or of some logical fault in the series of
interpretations, the ultimate case was wrong; but it is perhaps not
unknown in courts for a judgment to miscarry because all evidence
was not procurable, or because counsel made a particularly dazzling
leap over what for a less ingenious man would have been a yawning
chasm in the evidence. If miscarriages of justice occur, whether in
law or in bibliography, the fault is not in the method but in the
application. Parenthetically,

<pb n="006.078"/>

I should remark that the most dangerous fault in bibliography is
for a scholar, self-convinced, to attempt to carry his evidence
further than in fact it will reach without specifying the point at
which he is forsaking irreversible evidence for inference, and
inference for speculation.</p>
<p>Professor Dover Wilson's researches are frequently concerned
with the bibliographical matters of the printing process and of
compositorial and proofreaders' habits; but in his monograph on the
manuscript of <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi> and its printed transmissions he is
prone to use personal generalizations and speculations about
printing and to apply these assumptions to the text in question as
if they were facts which had been previously ascertained as true by
the corelation of large quantities of physical evidence derived
from the actual texts under examination. This is a very dangerous
method for unwary students to read, since they are often dazzled by
the seemingly bibliographical display of information without
recognizing that in truth the process of building up to an
hypothesis through a chain of circumstantial evidence governed by
strict laws has not been observed. The language of bibliography may
have been used, but not the method.</p>
<p>It is incumbent upon me to illustrate, and I choose an example
each from his consideration of the Quarto and the Folio texts of
<hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi>. Professor Wilson makes two assumptions about the
compositor of the good second quarto of <hi rend="italic">Hamlet,</hi> our basic
text, which are very important for his theory. (1) Only one
compositor set the whole text. (2) This compositor was an untutored
dolt who was setting difficult copy at a rate far beyond his normal
speed. As proof for the first, that only one compositor set the
text, he asserts only that the imperfections are so uniformly
distributed throughout that it is inconceivable they belong to two
different workmen. This is not bibliographical evidence, or proof,
and it would be thrown out in any court of law, for if the
imperfections of the copy were in some part responsible for the
printed results there might well be a relatively even distribution
of error. But convinced that the errors are compositorial, Wilson
automatically accepts
as authoritative various extra words supplied by the Folio, and
then uses&mdash;with some circularity of argument&mdash;the appearance
of
these words in the Folio as demonstration that they were missing in
the quarto. This may be textual criticism of a sort, but it is not
bibliography. Bibliography would use demonstrable evidence at the
very start of the argument to ascertain whether in fact one or two
compositors set the text. The only scientific method of
demonstration, the evidence of the printer's stick failing as it
does, would be to determine by a spelling test whether variable or
uniform compositorial habits are found in the spelling, leading by
classification into the assignment by pages of composition by
different workmen or to the hypothesis

<pb n="006.079"/>

that only one workman was concerned with the typesetting. This
basic examination is only now being worked on.</p>
<p>But for the sake of argument let us hypothecate (what is
actually untrue) that only one compositor set the second quarto of
<hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi>. If he were the illiterate numbskull that Wilson
makes him out to be, it is difficult to see how he was hired except
as an apprentice in a competitive and rigorously controlled trade.
Wilson's confident statements that this compositor could memorize
no more than one or two words at a time before turning to his cases
to set the required type are, of course, absurd since a disability
of this nature would certainly have prevented any printer from
hiring such a workman. Moreover, the very examples of anticipation
errors which Wilson provides and assigns to this compositor
disprove automatically his theory. But normal or abnormal, it is of
some importance to learn whether this compositor was in fact
immoderately rushed in his typesetting, for such a theory has some
bearing on the fidelity of his text. Wilson assumes that he was, on
the basis of his
errors. But this is not bibliographical evidence, since the errors
may have been caused by other factors. Indeed, the evidence of
analytical bibliography suggests quite the contrary, and that the
compositor was under no especial pressure. The details are too
technical to offer here. Suffice it to say that certain assumptions
can be made about the speed of presswork in relation to
compositorial speed of typesetting, at this time, on the evidence
of the specific manner in which the type-formes are imposed for the
press, specifically on the evidence for the number of
skeleton-formes constructed to hold the type-pages. That is, for
this date it seems established that the apparent inefficiency of
the one-skeleton method is not actually time-wasting if the press
for various reasons is ahead of the compositor. On the other hand,
for the two-skeleton method to be worth attempting the compositor
must be comfortably ahead of the press. Hence it is more than
ordinarily significant that Q2
<hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi> is printed by the two-skeleton method, an unlikely
situation if the compositor were as hurried as Wilson asserts.</p>
<p>But the evidence may be even more specific. Sheets B, C, and D
are imposed with a pair of skeleton-formes; but with sheet E two
more skeletons are constructed and thereafter the two sets of pairs
roughly alternate, the B-C-D pair imposing sheets F and I whereas
the new pair imposes sheets G, H, K, and L, until with sheets M, N,
and O the two pairs mix together according to a pattern which at
the moment I have not worked at enough to comment on. This general
alternation involving the use of four skeleton-formes is
inexplicable for printing with one press; yet if we hypothecate two
presses it follows that there must have been more than one
compositor. And recently Dr. Alice Walker has communicated

<pb n="006.080"/>

to me a spelling analysis she has made of Q2 in which the results
in an almost uncanny fashion coincide with the sheets imposed by
different skeletons to indicate with considerable certainty the
presence of two compositors. This dramatic new evidence may
possibly be buttressed, her preliminary further analysis shows, by
evidence of these same compositors in other Roberts' quartos. If
all this proves true, and there would seem to be little question of
the validity of the evidence, then so much for Wilson's
non-bibliographical assumptions about the uniformity of
compositorial error throughout Q2 and his highly colored picture of
the harried and driven single workman. If so much for these
assumptions, then perhaps so much for a number of far-reaching
conclusions he has drawn about the text on the basis of his false
evidence.</p>
<p>The case is no better for his consideration of the printing of
the Folio text. In examining what he believes to be the remarkably
higher percentage of error in the Folio <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi> in comparison
to <hi rend="italic">Antony and Cleopatra,</hi> the purpose being to assign the
error to the playhouse scribe and not to the Folio compositors, he
writes, "So wide indeed is the disparity that assuming as we
legitimately may that the texts were set up by compositors who
were, if not the same workmen at least of similar efficiency, it
can only be assigned to a fundamental difference in the copies
supplied them."</p>
<p>Now without regard for whether the conclusions reached are
correct or incorrect, the method used to reach them was only
pseudo-bibliographical since it played about with speculations
concerning printing but without a single piece of strictly
bibliographical evidence to back up these speculations. "Assuming
as we legitimately may that the texts were set up by compositors
who were, if not the same workmen, at least of similar efficiency."
This is not bibliographical evidence, at least not for a court of
law. Why may we assume that if there was more than one workman the
two were of equal efficiency? Presumably because they were both
employed in Jaggard's shop. But on this logic we should be able to
argue that the much maligned second-quarto compositors for Roberts'
<hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi> were the equal of the workman who set up
<hi rend="italic">King
Lear</hi> for Nicholas Okes since all were employed by reputable
London printers. Moreover, it is noticeable that the evidence is
begged whether there were
one or two compositors for these plays under scrutiny and whether
they <hi rend="italic">were</hi> the same workmen. The spelling-evidence which
enables us to distinguish the two Folio compositors was known at
the time Wilson contrived this passage, but he did not avail
himself of it to apply such tests to the plays about which he was
writing. If he had, he would have found that whereas <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi>
was set up by the two alternating compositors customarily
distinguished as A and B, <hi rend="italic">Antony and Cleopatra</hi> was
composed
by B alone. Thus, at least at the start, no inferences can be made
from a comparison

<pb n="006.081"/>

of the texts of the two plays in toto, but rather only by comparing
that part of <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi> set by B with his <hi rend="italic">Antony and
Cleopatra</hi> text. Thereupon it would be necessary to test the
faithfulness to copy of both A and B. This work has recently been
started independently at the University of Virginia and by Dr.
Alice Walker in this country. And in her new book on <hi rend="italic">Problems of
the First Folio,</hi> which I have seen in proof, Dr. Walker shows
that B was a more careless workman than A and was more prone to
error. It could be argued, therefore, that the Wilson hypothesis
for faulty <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi> copy is correct, since <hi rend="italic">Antony and
Cleopatra</hi> (set in its entirety by B) is in his opinion a
superior text to <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi> (in which the more conservatively
faithful A participated). But in fact, one must query the whole
basis for Wilson's assignment of error in both plays. Since no
previous text is available, only manifest error can be detected in
<hi rend="italic">Antony and Cleopatra;</hi> and
we have no means whatsoever for knowing when the compositor
departed from copy but yet made sufficient sense so that we cannot
detect his divergence. For <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi> divergence can be only
partially known and seldom (given our present state of information)
with great certainty. Nonetheless, we do have some sources for
determining corruption in the Folio <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi> which are denied
us in the Folio <hi rend="italic">Antony</hi>. Thus if we had the full facts about
<hi rend="italic">Antony,</hi> which we shall never have, the incidence of error
might, Wilson to the contrary, be at least as high as in
<hi rend="italic">Hamlet,</hi> or even higher. After all, what should we feel if
the cases were truly parallel and the only known <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi> text
were that in the Folio? To argue about the error in two
manuscripts, both lost, when the materials by which the two printed
results may be surveyed are so unequal is, I feel, dangerous
'bibliography.' And since Wilson's initial assumptions about the
equality of the compositors have
been proved wrong by Dr. Walker, one may question whether his ever
was a true bibliographical argument in the first place.</p>
<p>When we consider the millions of words and the books piled on
books that have been written about Shakespeare, it is astonishing
to contemplate how little of a basic nature has been done to
establish his text, and how much remains to do. One reason is that
the bibliographical method for textual enquiry, which was developed
first in this country by such great men as A. W. Pollard, R. B.
McKerrow, and Sir Walter Greg, is still comparatively new. Another
is that techniques are still being invented, or refined, to bring
to bear this method, at its most powerful, to an analysis of the
relation of the printing to Shakespeare's text. I turn now to a
brief account of what I take to be some of the central problems and
the methods that I anticipate will be applied to come to grips with
them.</p>
<p>It is a commonplace of textual criticism that no editor is

to tackle the details of his text until he has come to some general
view about its nature. What we disapprove of most at the present
day in 18th and 19th-century editions of Shakespeare is that the
editors almost invariably picked and chose among variants with no
fixed principle except their literary taste. This taste was often
excellent but it did not save them from blunders, as in the example
I have mentioned where up to half a dozen readings from the
unauthoritative second quarto of <hi rend="italic">Othello</hi> were commonly
introduced as authentic recoveries of Shakespeare's own words,
which they are not.</p>
<p>This general view of a text consists, perhaps, of two major
parts. When there is more than one text available, it is important
to estimate the exact relationship between them; and this leads
inevitably into an enquiry about the exact process by which they
descended&mdash;whether by direct derivation or collaterally&mdash;from
Shakespeare's own manuscript. In this investigation it is important
to attempt some analysis of what were the effects of this
transmission, including the work of scribes, compositors, and
possible editors. When there is only one text available, as in the
plays first printed in the Folio, this investigation is of course
somewhat circumscribed, but nevertheless such evidence as there is
must be evaluated as to what can be determined about the process of
transmission and the nature of the manuscript underlying the
printed version.</p>
<p>Some parts of this investigation concern pure textual criticism,
for McKerrow was correct, I believe, in disavowing as in any sense
bibliographical the speculative enquiry which is necessary to
achieve an hypothesis about the nature of a lost manuscript
underlying a printed text and the history of its transmission up to
the point that we can first read the text in print. But such
speculations often need the checkrein of bibliographical logic if
they are to escape manifest falseness.</p>
<p>The case is indeed worth a narrower scrutiny, for a principle is
present which reaches its fullest flower in the <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi>
problem. If the Folio text were indeed set from a manuscript,
independent concurrence of Folio and quarto in any reading would
powerfully argue for its correctness. In order to demonstrate the
need for emending any such reading we should be forced to argue
either that the error was present in some manuscript which lay
behind both the manuscript for the quarto and that for the Folio
prints, or else that the X-manuscript reading was correct but that
both quarto compositor and Folio compositor, or else a scribe
copying the manuscript which either used, in addition to the other
compositor, independently produced the same misreading. Such cases
are not unknown, but an editor must be very sure of his ground and
have palaeographical evidence to boot, before he engages himself to
alter such a reading. On the other hand, if the Folio directly
derived
from the quarto,

<pb n="006.083"/>

though with conflation from some manuscript source, concurrence of
the two texts in any reading is no serious argument for its
correctness, since the reading may perhaps represent an error left
uncorrected by the scribal preparer. In fact, it is a paradox of
textual criticism, as Sir Walter Greg has pointed out, that when
such a derivation of texts can be established, readings in which
the two texts concur are much more likely to hide errors, and to be
in greater need of emendation, than readings in which the two texts
differ.</p>
<p>Of course an editorial problem still resides in the variants,
whatever the relationship of the texts, since the source for those
in the Folio must still be hypothecated and the authority
established. It does not do to take it as axiomatic that Folio
variants, coming from an authoritative source, are thereby superior
to the quarto in expressing Shakespeare's final intentions. The
chain of transmission which may lie behind the manuscript used to
correct the quarto could have been such as to afford opportunity
for errors to creep in, these errors being faithfully copied by the
scribe annotating the quarto. And by no means all such errors will
be apparent errors. The majority are quite plausible readings. But
the case may be even stronger. Dr. Williams has argued in an
unpublished paper that by and large in <hi rend="italic">Troilus and Cressida</hi>,
where the same situation obtains, the manuscript behind the quarto
was a Shakespeare fair copy somewhat revised in the process of
copying from the
original, and that the manuscript used to revise this quarto for
the Folio printer's copy was Shakespeare's foul papers, or original
draft. Thus if one accepts a Folio reading when it differs from
that of the quarto, the odds are&mdash;it is argued&mdash;that one is
rejecting a Shakespeare revision in favor of a Shakespeare first
thought which he had modified. The case is a very interesting one
and fortunately is in process of close examination.
<ref target="f006.05.01b" n="*"><hi rend="super">*</hi></ref></p>
<p>When we turn to 2 <hi rend="italic">Henry IV,</hi> some of the problems I
have
cited, such as hypotheses about the nature of the manuscripts which
in one way or another must lie behind the quarto text, and the
Folio at least in part, are not proper subjects for truly
bibliographical enquiry. But in two particular respects
bibliography can, I think, be of assistance. To date, the arguments
on each side&mdash;one for the independent typesetting of the Folio
from a manuscript, and the other for the use as copy of an
annotated quarto&mdash;have rested very largely on textual evidence of
a non-bibliographical cast. There is certainly some reason to hope
that a minute bibliographical examination of the formal
characteristics of both texts would establish the case for direct
derivation, or&mdash;with more difficulty&mdash;by demonstrating the
lack
of sufficient evidence for a direct relationship, the probability
that

<pb n="006.084"/>

the Folio was indeed set from a new manuscript. Then once the exact
relationship of the two texts was determined, the problem of the
variants could be tackled from a narrow and partial yet a necessary
point of view. I refer to a comparison of the variants with a
classification of the known habits in departing from copy of which
both compositors A and B, in somewhat different ways and degrees,
were occasionally guilty. It is very likely that such a minute
comparison would establish the strong probability that certain
variant readings in the Folio did not emanate from the
authoritative manuscript which had an effect on its text, but are
instead unauthoritative compositor's errors which an editor should
weed out of the text. The investigation of the problem of 2
<hi rend="italic">Henry IV,</hi> I think it is obvious, is still only in its
elementary stages; and any scholar who tackled it with the proper
rigorous method and wide sweep of evidence would be kept happily
occupied for a good long
time.<ref target="f006.05.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref></p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Richard III</hi> is an example of a play in which the
necessary analysis has reached an intermediate stage. The main
points in its textual history are these. In the late nineteenth
century the estimate was correctly made that the basic source for
the Folio text was a copy of the sixth quarto of 1622. Much later
two further important discoveries were made. It was effectively
demonstrated that the source for the text of the first quarto (all
later quartos being mere reprints) was not an authoritative
manuscript with some direct transmissional link to Shakespeare's
own, but instead a memorially contaminated text very likely derived
from the actors reciting their parts as they remembered them in
order to make up a new prompt book. It was furthermore discovered
that the source for the numerous Folio alterations lay in a
collation of Q6 against a new and authoritative manuscript of some
sort in order to revise the faulty printed text. Finally it was
found that not all the play had
been so collated and revised, but that several hundred lines
divided between a large patch in the opening of Act 3, scene 1, and
another at the conclusion of the play, were printed unannotated in
the Folio from leaves detached from a copy of the third
edition.</p>
<p>By ordinary standards these facts illuminating a most complex
case would be taken as sufficient to guide an editor in the
recovery of as much of the true text as we are ever likely to
know&mdash;parts, of course, never

<pb n="006.085"/>

can be recovered and we must rest content with corrupted lines of
Shakespeare which we are powerless to restore. But an editor must
make every endeavor to learn the <hi rend="italic">how</hi> and the
<hi rend="italic">why</hi>
of
such a situation, for his estimate of this <hi rend="italic">how</hi> and
<hi rend="italic">why</hi> may influence his treatment of the printed results. Thus
it is most important for textual criticism to learn whether the
manuscript used to correct the sixth quarto was a playhouse
promptbook, as most critics have maintained, or else, as Alice
Walker has recently argued, Shakespeare's own foul papers. Any
editor will need to come to some decision on this question, for on
the answer to it hinges in part his estimate as to the odds for
relative purity or else for possible corruption in the Folio
revisions. But before we pass to what bibliography can do, let me
point out two implications which might be missed by an editor. If
Alice Walker is right in her hypothesis (and I find it a very
attractive one) that the quarto was
not collated and annotated by Heminge and Condell or their agents
to serve as printer's copy, but instead the patched manuscript was
given to Jaggard to serve as his copy and for convenience he had
the collation made in his printing-house so that his compositors
could work largely from printed copy, it follows that if the work
were done in the printing-house an editor could estimate the
annotations as ingenuous transcripts from the manuscript without
any possibility of sophistication from the memory of an
actor-scribe such as has been argued for some other plays.
Moreover, it follows that we must re-examine all other similar
printer's copy, which we have automatically assumed was revised and
annotated in the playhouse, for at least some of it may also have
been collated instead by Jaggard, a fact that would give us a
somewhat different view occasionally of the nature and authority of
the variants.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of her case for the nature of the manuscript
and the history of the text, Dr. Walker makes a very significant
bibliographical analysis to guide a future editor. The specific
problems are: (1) how many of the Folio variants are authoritative
and how many scribal or compositorial errors; (2) how many errors
in the quarto text did the collating scribe <hi rend="italic">fail</hi> to
correct.</p>
<p>Her use of evidence is very interesting. On the basis of the
respective shares of compositors A and B in the unannotated section
set from the third quarto, she evolves some statistics to assist an
editor in estimating the proportion of Folio variants which may
reasonably represent compositorial errors and not scribal
corrections. She then attacks the problem of the failure of the
scribe to correct. With absolute logic she offers the proposition
that when Q6 by the history of its transmission from the first
edition varied from this first edition, and when the scribe by
reference to his manuscript restored the Q1 reading, this is
unassailable proof that he had correctly transcribed an
authoritative reading from his manuscript.

<pb n="006.086"/>

This happened a certain number of times. On the other hand, when a
reading in Q6 differed from that in Q1 by reason of its printed
transmission and had been passed over by the scribe without
revision, he had manifestly failed to copy the necessary correction
from his manuscript, either of the Q1 or of a different reading.
This happened a certain number of times. On the basis of these
statistics Dr. Walker arrives at an estimate that about 140
non-Shakespearian readings are still present in the Folio text. At
least in part, the method is bibliographical, and it needs only a
fuller and more rigorous examination of the respective
characteristics of compositors A and B, as derived from other plays
which can act as a control, letting us see in completeness their
wanderings from copy,&mdash;it needs only this fuller analysis to
provide an editor with the maximum bibliographical knowledge he can
obtain before starting his work. What I find very pleasant in Dr.
Walker's concluding assertion
that her findings should encourage an editor to emend more boldly
than is usual, is the paradox that bibliography which will
sometimes narrowly limit an editor's discretion to alter his text,
in cases like this actually opens the door wide for all the
resources of textual criticism.</p>
<p>Certainly this added freedom which bibliography can sometimes
afford an editor to be logically bold is exemplified with <hi rend="italic">King
Lear</hi>, and it is not too much to say that recent bibliographical
work has quite upended the conventional editorial treatment of this
text, and in some respects outmoded every available edition.
Professor Duthie's admirable edition published a few years ago gave
the text a much needed thorough analysis. He performed a signal
service in disposing of the shorthand theory to explain the
peculiarities of the first quarto, and in analyzing the work of the
scribe who annotated this quarto by reference to a playhouse
manuscript in order to furnish the Folio copy. When he came to
attack the problem of the Folio variants in constructing his own
text, Duthie felt confident that critical ability alone could
distinguish in the main between the authority of quarto and Folio
in cases of significant readings. But when he arrived at the
problem of the relatively
indifferent reading, he confessed that criticism was helpless and
that he had no recourse but to prefer the Folio variant since it
was present in a text of generally greater authority. Some hundreds
of readings in which the choice seemed indifferent, therefore, were
arbitrarily accepted from a single source.</p>
<p>Now it is clear that in all cases of variation between quarto
and Folio, either the preparer scribe or the compositor must be
responsible, and it seems reasonable to assume that if the Folio
readings are accepted in all such cases, in a certain percentage an
editor is incorporating unauthoritative compositorial departures
from copy. Whatever little authority any specific reading may have
in the first quarto, with its contaminated text,

<pb n="006.087"/>

the possibility that Shakespeare is being accurately reproduced is
at least greater than that a compositorial error in the Folio is
accidentally recovering the true reading. However, nothing could be
done about this problem until a method was evolved to reach some
evidence to assist an editor in separating compositorial variants
from scribal corrections, especially for the large body of
indifferent choices. A start has now been made on the problem by
the method of compositorial analysis. It would not be surprising to
find that in over a hundred cases an editor is justified in
rejecting a commonly accepted Folio reading in favor of the quarto.
For <hi rend="italic">King Lear</hi> this is an almost revolutionary prospect, but
I have no doubt that the method will be the correct one to follow,
no matter how much more complicated it will make an editor's life
in the future by immensely broadening the number of choices between
variants which he must make.</p>
<p>I am emphasizing the need for the minute study of the
compositors who set Shakespeare texts because it is through these
workmen that what Shakespeare wrote was set into type and printed
in the texts now preserved to us. What these compositors did with
the words they found in manuscript concerns us closely,
for&mdash;cumulatively&mdash;it is not impossible that in thousands of
small but eventually important ways these workmen have altered the
exact reading of their copy. Therefore, the textual bibliographer
is deeply interested in finding&mdash;for the First Folio&mdash;to give an
example&mdash;precisely which pages and columns were typeset by which
compositor, and how many workmen were in fact concerned in the
composition of the First Folio text. Possibly there were also
compositors C and D. The case is still uncertain. By an analytical
examination of the evidence bearing on the presswork, we seek to
learn what parts of the Folio were printed on one press and what
parts on two presses. We want to
recover any evidence as to whether a compositor was hurried or at
leisure in composing certain pages; and the method by which the
sheets went through the press can tell us much about this. Then we
want to know every last thing there is to know about the habits of
spelling, punctuation, and of faithfulness or carelessness in
following copy for each compositor who worked on the book. This
evidence can all be applied in one place or another to help remove
the veil which the printing process places between us and the
manuscript, and to help recover the at least relative purity of the
manuscript reading. Let me illustrate with an example which is not
concerned with an especially common problem but which I think is
interesting. Some years ago I heard Professor G. B. Harrison
deliver a paper on <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus,</hi> in which he
argued&mdash;very
convincingly at the time, it seemed,&mdash;that the irregular lineation
found in this Folio play represented a faithful following of
Shakespeare's
manuscript. And by showing the results which the rough lines had on
vocal delivery as against the conventional

<pb n="006.088"/>

smoothing out and regularizing of the lines into normal pentameter
units, Harrison carried his audience along with him most
successfully to accept his point of view that the irregularities
were conscious with Shakespeare and represented a part of his
dramatic and poetic art. Now, however, that we know something about
the compositors, and learn from Dr. Walker that whereas A more
often simply turned a long line under in the Folio, compositor B
was just as likely to make two lines of it, it is clear that these
days before we attempt to apply critical evidence as Professor
Harrison did, we must be bibliographical and must break down the
typesetting of the play and see where we stand. Thus since both A
and B were concerned with <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi>, we shall need to
distinguish their work and to see if there were any marked
difference, such as we find in other plays, between the way the
lines were split or were turned over in their respective sections.
And only then, after this systematic
bibliographical examination had been made and the characteristics
of the text established as deriving from the manuscript or from the
compositor in small or in large part, can we have a foundation of
fact on which to base a critical discussion of the irregular
lineation of <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi>. But the need to know everything
there is to know about the characteristics of the Shakespearian
compositors goes far beyond questions of verse-lining and into the
very words that we read as Shakespeare's&mdash;we hope. For at present
we can only hope in many cases of complex doubt&mdash;we do not yet
have the bibliographical facts on which to base an opinion that is
worth very much.</p>
<p>There is another gap in our knowledge of the way in which the
printing process may have corrupted the text we have commonly
accepted. We have very curiously never made the collation of copies
that is necessary to discover which pages of an early Shakespeare
text were proofread and what were the changes that took place as a
result of the proofreading. I do not know of any source where a
student can go to find out the facts about proof-correctors'
variants in most of the Shakespeare first quartos, which are often
the highest authorities for our text: so far as I know the majority
have never been fully collated. This I think is a shocking state of
affairs. It means that editors have been content to take their text
from any random copy that was most convenient for them, without
curiosity as to whether they were reprinting compositors' errors or
proof-readers' sophistications. When the text has been based on the
Folio the case is no better. In sorrow I quote from the preface to
the
latest edition of <hi rend="italic">King Lear:</hi> "It has recently been suggested
that a study of all the extant copies of the First Folio would
reveal variants comparable in importance with those in the extant
copies of the First Quarto. As no evidence has yet been produced
that the Folio is made up of corrected and uncorrected sheets, I am
skeptical of this theory; but I have consulted

<pb n="006.089"/>

facsimiles of two different copies of the Folio as well as the two
originals accessible in Leeds, without discovering any variants."
To be skeptical whether there are corrected and uncorrected formes
in the First Folio is to be skeptical indeed, for in 1932 in the
basic study of the printing of the First Folio Dr. Willoughby
reprinted a facsimile of an actual proof-marked sheet in <hi rend="italic">Antony
and Cleopatra</hi>, and since then three further proof-sheets have
been discovered by Professor Hinman in the Folio. This editor
simply had bad luck in finding no variants in the four copies he
collated, since I have been shown at least one sheet for
<hi rend="italic">Lear</hi> in which variants exist. Fortunately future editors can
no longer remain in blissful ignorance of the facts about the Folio
once Dr. Hinman finishes his collation of the seventy-nine First
Folios in the Folger Shakespeare Library by means of his most
ingenious mechanical collating machine, which reveals
press-variants by super-imposing
the images of the pages from two different copies. And while I do
not myself expect that variants will be discovered which rank in
importance with those in the First Quarto <hi rend="italic">Lear,</hi> for the
nature of the copy in the two printing houses was very different,
nevertheless it would be surprising if the results did not increase
our ability to ladle out the dross from the gold in various
passages.</p>
<p>Because no one, except for the New Variorum editors, has been
willing to engage himself to the undoubted drudgery of collation,
it is a paradox that we know more about the variable factors in the
text of certain relatively minor Elizabethan playwrights like Field
and Massinger than we know about Shakespeare's text. But collation
of the authoritative texts is not all that is needed. It is true
that usually there is no textual service to the discovery of
variants in late and unauthoritative reprints of the basic texts.
But I should like to point out one overlooked situation in which it
is important for us to know if the text was indeed altered in any
respect during the course of printing a late and unauthoritative
edition. Let us take <hi rend="italic">Richard III</hi> as our illustration, a
play&mdash;it will be recalled&mdash;in which an example of the sixth
quarto was conflated with a manuscript to serve as printer's copy
for the Folio. When the Folio deviates from Q6, therefore, we may
take it that
in ordinary circumstances the different reading came from the
manuscript. But I have already commented on the fact that not all
such variants will have this authority, for it is positive that
some will have been made by the Folio compositors. These, of
course, should be thrown out in so far as we can develop the
bibliographical means to enable a textual critic to isolate them.
But even if we then disregard variants made by scribal blunder
(which will not always be easy to detect), one further class may
remain, even though only a handful of variants could be concerned.
<hi rend="italic">If</hi> the formes of Q6 were proofread while the sheets were
being printed, we should have some variant readings

<pb n="006.090"/>

in this edition. And <hi rend="italic">if</hi> some of these variants were present
in the particular example used by the scribe to prepare copy, and
<hi rend="italic">if</hi> he left some unaltered (as we know he left a number of
errors unaltered that can be detected), we should have still more
concealed errors masquerading as true manuscript readings of
authority. I do not know for <hi rend="italic">Richard III</hi> whether this
situation exists, nor does anybody else, least of all any editor of
<hi rend="italic">Richard III,</hi> for no one has taken the trouble ever to
collate a number of copies of Q6 to determine whether there are
press-variant readings in this edition. Yet no bibliographical
editor would dare to tackle the text without making this elementary
study, even though he anticipated what he would doubtless find,
purely negative or trivial results.</p>
<p>It is time for me to summarize what the bibliographical method
can still contribute to assist with establishing Shakespeare's
text.</p>
<p>First, it can re-survey every doubtful case, such as <hi rend="italic">Hamlet,
Othello,</hi> and 2 <hi rend="italic">Henry IV</hi> in which there is still
controversy whether the Folio text, which differs considerably from
that of earlier quartos, was set directly from a manuscript, or
else from a copy of some quarto edition which had been annotated by
comparison with a manuscript or, as I believe for 2 <hi rend="italic">Henry
IV,</hi> had been used as the basis for a manuscript which served as
Folio copy. This is not an academic question, for the principle of
one's whole treatment of the text rests on the answer to the
central problem: what exactly was the nature of the Folio printer's
copy.</p>
<p>Secondly, by means of the necessary collation and the
interpretation of the variants made in printed texts while they
were going through the press, the bibliographical method can
discover and classify these proofreaders' alterations with a view
to recovering the true Shakespearian readings, or at least to
distinguishing the certainly non-Shakespearian.</p>
<p>Thirdly, since the bibliographical method is concerned with the
effect of the printing process on Shakespeare's text, it can make
searching analytical studies of the relationship between the
compositors (those intermediaries by which the text was transmitted
to us) and the actual printing. Analytical bibliography can still
find material to work on in Shakespeare by investigating the speed
of presswork which, if suddenly accelerated, might affect the
accuracy of the compositor hurrying to keep up with the press. A
combination of analytical and textual bibliography, moreover, is
necessary to distinguish in every Shakespeare text the number of
compositors engaged on it and the exact sections for which each set
the type. Then, by a series of extremely rigorous studies, the
characteristics of these compositors must be analyzed in other
printed texts where proper comparisons may be made; and finally
everything that we know about the care or the negligence with which
they treated
what they were typesetting,

<pb n="006.091"/>

including what we can learn of their characteristic habits of
altering text, must be applied to their work in the Shakespeare
canon. Only when all this mass of investigation is done, perhaps
years hence, can we say that we have honestly and thoroughly
squeezed every last drop out of the possible evidence for deciding
in every minute detail, as close as we can come to it, what
Shakespeare actually wrote. I do not assert that this
bibliographical approach can displace the critical approach, for
the two methods must work hand in hand supplementing each other.
But I do argue that as scholars we have been most delinquent in
failing to utilize the bibliographical method to its fullest extent
and in preferring the easier delights of armchair critical
speculation to the rigors of first ascertaining the fullest body of
facts by bibliographical investigation. Only when all the facts are
known can we proceed to the necessary critical synthesis which will
make of our attempt to recover the
maximum of what Shakespeare truly wrote more than a thing of shreds
and patches tailored according to our personal preferences.</p>

and ends with the words <hi rend="italic">numquam aliquis deorum simul
colitur</hi>
in a note which is common to Servius Danielis and the vulgate
Servius on <hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi> VI 830.

<p>Within <hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi> I-II the Cassellanus is the principal
manuscript for Servius Danielis. Thilo
<ref target="f006.06.06" n="6"><hi rend="super">6</hi></ref> and Savage
<ref target="f006.06.07" n="7"><hi rend="super">7</hi></ref> equate it with the basic codex
Fuldensis, of which Daniel states in his Praefatio
<ref target="f006.06.08" n="8"><hi rend="super">8</hi></ref> that he received a collation just as
his edition was going to press, too late for him to do more than
publish the collation as an appendix keyed to the text which he had
already constituted from other sources. So confident was Thilo in
this equation that he employed the siglum <hi rend="italic">C</hi> indiscriminately
to designate readings taken either from the Cassellanus itself or
from Daniel's appendix, to which recourse was and still is
necessary for passages presumably once found in the now lost
quaternions of the Cassellanus. The identity of these two texts has
lately been challenged by Elder,<ref target="f006.06.09" n="9"><hi rend="super">9</hi></ref>
but surely the similarity between them was uncommonly close. For
<hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi>
III and following, however, the Cassellanus presents an entirely
different and somewhat ambiguous aspect. It is almost completely
devoid of the long passages foreign to the vulgate that most
strikingly characterize Servius Danielis as represented by <hi rend="italic">F
G</hi>, and has superficially the appearance of a vulgate text. In
notes that are substantially common to the two traditions, however,
it manifests most of the textual peculiarities of Servius
Danielis.</p>
<p>The situation will become clearer with a review of the essential
nature of Servius Danielis. Following upon the studies of
Barwick<ref target="f006.06.10" n="10"><hi rend="super">10</hi></ref> and Rand,
<ref target="f006.06.11" n="11"><hi rend="super">11</hi></ref> there is general agreement with the

proposition that Servius Danielis represents a fusion of the
genuine commentary of Servius on Vergil, as embodied in well over
a hundred extant manuscripts, with some other single ancient
commentary, probably older than Servius' and in certain respects
more valuable. Servius', however, as the more widely known and
respected, became the dominant partner in this merger of texts and
served as the basis for the <hi rend="italic">contaminatio</hi> which resulted. The
other (which we may call the D) commentary the compiler used as a
mine of interesting and clearly ancient material with which
Servius' might be enriched. Some of this was entirely extraneous to
Servius, keyed to lemmata about which Servius had nothing to say.
This could readily be introduced, with
a new lemma, where the sequence of words in Vergil entitled it to
a place. Some took the form of additional comment on words

<pb n="006.095"/>

or phrases already discussed by Servius. Material of this sort is
loosely and often inelegantly grafted upon the Servian note,
sometimes without so much as an effort to adjust conjunctions and
transitional expressions to their new context. In a few cases the
compiler appears to have found parallel exegesis in the two
commentaries, with D offering a more expanded form of the same note
that is found in Servius.<ref target="f006.06.12" n="12"><hi rend="super">12</hi></ref> It is
possible that D may have been Servius' direct source for these
notes. In view, however, of the penchant of ancient scholiasts and
encyclopaedists for mechanically transcribing the words of their
sources, it is perhaps more likely that both D and Servius were
drawing upon the same original. Where the compiler found notes that
were parallel in this way, it was of course natural for him to
adopt the fuller form. Finally, for considerably more than half of
his notes, the compiler seems to have been quite satisfied with
what he found in
Servius. At any rate, whether because he discovered no new material
in the D commentary or because he chose to reject it, he simply
adopted the Servius as he found it in his Servius text.</p>
<p>Against this background, the character of the Cassellanus
emerges more plainly. In <hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi> III ff., it consistently
lacks the more extensive additions made by Servius Danielis to the
vulgate text, not only those notes which are new in their entirety,
as, for example, the note on TRISTE PER AVGVRIVM
(<hi rend="italic">Aen.</hi>
V 7;
Th. 589, 5-17), but also the supplements to notes occurring in
Servius, for example, to the one on DARDANIVM ACESTEN
(<hi rend="italic">Aen.</hi>
V 30; Th. 593, 3-20). When the Danieline additions are of shorter
extent, however, they sometimes appear in the Cassellanus, e.g.,

<list>

</list>

and when the manuscripts of Servius Danielis exhibit textual
idiosyncrasies embedded within notes that are common to the two
traditions, the Cassellanus oftener than not shares them. The
following instances are typical of many:

<list>

</list>

On the other hand, the reverse situation (with the Cassellanus on
the side of vulgate Servius) also occurs, e.g.,

<list>
<item>A. III 571 (Th. 439, 3) aquarum odor] <hi rend="italic">Serv. C</hi> odor

aquarum <hi rend="italic">F G</hi></item>

numquam tege (<hi rend="italic">pro</hi> tegi?) solet <hi rend="italic">F G</hi></item>
</list>

and on occasion the text of the Cassellanus appears to be eclectic,
as on <hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi> III 297:

<list>
<label>Servius Danielis</label>

<item>PATRIO MARITO atqui Thebana fuit, de Thebis Phrygiis. sed aut

provinciam pro patria posuit&mdash;et (aut <hi rend="italic">F</hi>) probamus pro

<label>Vulgate Servius</label>

<item>PATRIO MARITO atqui Thebana fuit. sed aut provinciam pro
patria posuit, ut (I 380) <hi rend="italic">Italiam quaero provinciam</hi>, item
Sallustius, etc.</item>

<label>Cassellanus</label>

<item>PATRIO MARITO atqui Thebana fuit. aut probamus pro patria,
ut
Salustius, etc.</item>
</list>

<pb n="006.097"/>

In this passage, it will be observed, the Cassellanus lacks the
Danieline <hi rend="italic">de Thebis Phrygiis</hi> and also (perhaps by a kind of
homoeoarchy) the <hi rend="italic">sed aut provinciam pro patria posuit</hi> which
is common to the two traditions. But it concludes with Servius
Danielis, <hi rend="italic">aut probamus pro patria, ut Salustius</hi>.</p>
<p>Analysis shows that the text of Servius which the compiler used
in constructing Servius Danielis did not belong to any one of the
three families of Servius manuscripts distinguished by the Harvard
editors. Servius Danielis, therefore, adumbrates a fourth variety
of vulgate text, and an attractive hypothesis suggested by the
suddenly reduced state of the Cassellanus in <hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi> III ff.
is that it may represent the compiler's Servius, in which case the
Danieline symptoms which it betrays would derive neither from the
D commentary nor from any activity on the part of the compiler but
rather from an otherwise now extinct form of Servius text which the
compiler used. If this could be established, the Cassellanus would
assume substantial importance in what must at best be a doubtful
reconstruction of the lost D commentary.</p>
<p>The weight of probability is indeed on the side of the view
<ref target="f006.06.13" n="13"><hi rend="super">13</hi></ref> that some, at least, of the
discrepancies between Servius Danielis and the extant vulgate do
stem from the compiler's Servius. That the Cassellanus affords any
clue to their identity, however, is by no means clear, and on the
contrary becomes exceedingly dubious in the face of clear
indications<ref target="f006.06.14" n="14"><hi rend="super">14</hi></ref> that the Cassellanus,
for <hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi> III ff. as well as for the books that precede,
descends from a source which once embodied the full Servius
Danielis and out of which the D supplements were systematically, if
not entirely effectively, filtered.</p>
<p>On <hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi> III 244, for example, where Vergil says of
the
harpies,

<q>
<l>celerique fuga sub sidera lapsae</l>
<l>semesam praedam et vestigia foeda relinquunt,</l>
</q>

Servius, elucidating <hi rend="italic">vestigia</hi>, explains briefly: <hi rend="italic">pedum
signa</hi>. Servius Danielis subjoins an alternative: <hi rend="italic">vel pedum
signa vel indicium sordium quibus epulas discedentes
polluebant</hi>. The Cassellanus, in its customary fashion, fails to
show the Danieline addition, but offers the text, <hi rend="italic">VESTIGIA vel
pedum signa</hi>. In the restricted context, the <hi rend="italic">vel</hi>
becomes
utterly otiose and finds its readiest explanation in the hypothesis
that somewhere in the Cassellanus' line of descent the <hi rend="italic">vel
indicium sordium quibus epulas discedentes polluebant</hi> was
marked for deletion, probably by someone whose purpose it was to
purge the text of its D elements, but the <hi rend="italic">vel</hi> before
<hi rend="italic">pedum</hi> was overlooked. A similar situation recurs a few lines
later, at <hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi> III 249, where the two traditions diverge
as follows:
</p>
<pb n="006.098"/>

<q>
<p>Servius Danielis</p>
<p>PATRIO REGNO aut Neptunio aut, sicut alii dicunt, quia Thaumas,
pater earum ex Electra, Ponti et Terrae filius fuit.</p>
<p>Vulgate Servius</p>
<p>PATRIO REGNO Neptunio.</p>
</q>

<p>The Cassellanus reads <hi rend="italic">PATRIO REGNO ait Neptunio</hi>,
omitting
all that follows <hi rend="italic">Neptunio</hi> in Servius Danielis. As the note
on <hi rend="italic">PATRIO REGNO</hi>, <hi rend="italic">ait Neptunio</hi> is nonsense,
and
would
seem to represent a clumsy emendation of an intermediate <hi rend="italic">aut
Neptunio</hi>, in which the <hi rend="italic">aut</hi>, like the <hi rend="italic">vel</hi>
above,
became impossible after the loss of Daniel's <hi rend="italic">aut sicut alii
dicunt . . . fuit</hi>. One more example may suffice. At
<hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi> III 310, Vergil makes Andromache inquire of the
unexpectedly appearing Aeneas:

<q>
<l>verane te facies, verus mihi nuntius adfers?</l>
</q>

Servius comments: <hi rend="italic">et secundum muliebrem adfectum interrogat et
bene suspicatur; nam et inferis sacrificat et in luco, in quo
habitant manes</hi>. Servius Danielis carries the same note, with
the addition of <hi rend="italic">sicut supra dictum est</hi> after <hi rend="italic">muliebrem
adfectum</hi>, the allusion being to a foregoing observation found
only in Servius Danielis: <hi rend="italic">et opportunum principium feminae quam
incertam timor fecerat</hi>. The Cassellanus, as might have been
expected, omits the <hi rend="italic">et opportunum principium feminae quam
incertam timor fecerat</hi>, but retains the <hi rend="italic">sicut supra dictum
est</hi> which refers to it&mdash;a further instance of apparent
oversight on the part of one whose efforts were directed toward
excluding the D from Servius Danielis.</p>
<p>From these examples, which could be multiplied, it is apparent
that the Cassellanus for <hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi> III ff. constitutes not a
fourth form of the vulgate Servius but a mutilated specimen of
Servius Danielis. Why this mutilation came about only in
<hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi> III ff., while <hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi> I-II escaped, is a
matter of conjecture. Perhaps, as has been suggested,
<ref target="f006.06.15" n="15"><hi rend="super">15</hi></ref> archetypal Servius Danielis was in
several volumes, with a break between <hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi> II and
<hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi> III. Perhaps the answer may be found in the
mechanics
of the filter process, as, for example, if the D supplements were
marked in an ancestor of the Cassellanus (call it an Ur-<hi rend="italic">C</hi>)
with symbols which the copyist in <hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi> I-II either
overlooked, did not understand, or had not been instructed to
observe. Whatever may be the explanation, the conclusion is plain,
that the existing Cassellanus represents a text that is in its
essence Danieline throughout, and that, while for
<hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi> III ff. the notes parallel in extent those of the
vulgate Servius, the residual text is of the character of Servius
Danielis.</p>


<pb n="006.099"/>

<p>That there are a significant number of instances in which the
Cassellanus reads with the vulgate against Servius Danielis has
already been remarked. A few of these are of considerable extent,
as, for example, at <hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi> V 241, where the two traditions
diverge as follows, and the Cassellanus reads wholly with Servius:
</p>
<q>
<p>Servius Danielis</p>
<p>indignata Iuno quod ex pellice sua Semele natus Liber pater ab
Ino matertera eius esset nutritus, Athamanti viro eius, regi
Thebanorum sive, ut quidam volunt, Orchomeniorum, furorem inmisit,
qui cum occiso Learcho filio, dum eum feram credit, Melicertam
alterum filium cum Ino uxore sua persequeretur . . .</p>
<p>Vulgate Servius</p>
<p>Athamas post furorem a Iunone inissum cum, occiso Learcho,
Melicertam alterum filium cum uxore sua persequeretur . . .</p>
</q>

<p>and at <hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi> III 351, where the Cassellanus reads with
Servius except for the omission of <hi rend="italic">ut</hi> in the third line:
</p>
<q>
<p>Servius Danielis</p>
<p>AGNOSCO aut <hi rend="italic">cognomine agnosco</hi>&mdash;nam ea
cognoscimus quae
iam pridem videmus&mdash;aut certe quia reparatam audierat
Troiam.</p>
<p>Vulgate Servius</p>
<p>AGNOSCO aut <hi rend="italic">cognomine agnosco</hi> aut certe quia
reparatam
audierat Troiam, ut (A. III 294) <hi rend="italic">hic incredibilis rerum fama
occupat aures.</hi></p>
</q>

<p>In order, however, to eliminate the D from Ur-<hi rend="italic">C</hi>, it was
necessary to subject that text to rather careful collation with the
text of some Servius manuscript. While it was undoubtedly the
additions from D for which the collator was particularly on the
watch, it would not have been at all unnatural, since his whole
activity was predicated on the assumption of the superiority of the
vulgate Servius to Servius Danielis, for him occasionally to have
noted&mdash;marginally or interlinearly&mdash;variants or larger
discrepancies on which his eye might have happened to light. Such
instances, therefore, need not undermine our belief in the
Cassellanus as fundamentally a Danieline text.</p>
<p>If the Cassellanus disappoints us in one hope, however, it at
least partially fulfills another. As has been shown in my former
article,<ref target="f006.06.16" n="16"><hi rend="super">16</hi></ref> there is only one
complete manuscript of Servius Danielis for <hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi> III-V,
Thilo's <hi rend="italic">F</hi>, and, while <hi rend="italic">G</hi> seems not to have been

copied
from it, its relationship to <hi rend="italic">F</hi> is so close that the two
together comprise an exceedingly

<pb n="006.100"/>

narrow base for the text. A Paris manuscript (B. N. Lat. 1750)
<ref target="f006.06.17" n="17"><hi rend="super">17</hi></ref> serves as a check upon
<hi rend="italic">F-G</hi>
in
the passages which it contains, but, since its text is very much
abridged, its testimony is often lacking. The Cassellanus, its
authority as a manuscript of Servius Danielis vindicated,
considerably extends the area in which a check is available upon
the vagaries of <hi rend="italic">F-G</hi>, and, although not, unfortunately, in
the long added notes from D on which help is particularly needed,
enables the editor to dismiss some of their divergences from the
vulgate Servius as the discrepancies of a single manuscript line
rather than of the tradition of Servius Danielis.</p>
<p>The writer would lay down the following principles to govern the
use of the Cassellanus:

<list>
<item>a. When the Cassellanus supports <hi rend="italic">F-G</hi> in a one-word

variant, an inversion of word order, or the omission of an
unessential word, the reading receives strong confirmation as
authentic Servius Danielis.</item>

<item>b. The shorter additions of <hi rend="italic">F-G</hi> which occur in the
Cassellanus are probably Danieline and were overlooked by the
collator when he was endeavoring to "purge" the Ur-<hi rend="italic">C</hi>.
Cassellanus readings, therefore, merit almost if not quite the
respect accorded to the readings of <hi rend="italic">F-G</hi>.</item>

<item>c. When the Cassellanus attests short bits of text that do
not occur in <hi rend="italic">F-G</hi> but are found in the vulgate, they probably
belong to the tradition of Servius Danielis. Since the purge was
not rigorous enough to eliminate the shorter additions of Servius
Danielis which were found in the Ur-<hi rend="italic">C</hi>, it is unlikely that
the collation was performed with sufficient care to result in the
supplying from Servius of omissions in the Ur-<hi rend="italic">C</hi> of the same
extent.</item>

<item>d. In the comparatively few cases where the text of the
Cassellanus diverges sharply from that of <hi rend="italic">F-G</hi> or is
substantially more extensive, the probability is that it is not
Danieline but that it was introduced into the Ur-<hi rend="italic">C</hi> from the
text of Servius with which it was being collated.</item>

<p>In the Spring of 1952, the Pierpont Morgan Library acquired the
only known copy of a previously undescribed English incunable. Such
an event, especially in the case of a work of literary interest
written in the vernacular, is not one of routine occurrence; it has
consequently been thought proper that this new "find" be given a
somewhat more extensive discussion than the familiar "previously
unknown" incunabulum normally deserves. The results, it is
believed, will not only fix the approximate date and the proper
order in which the several editions appeared, but will also
indicate to bibliographers the value of textual study in the
solution of bibliographical problems.</p>
<p>In the form advocated by the present writer (<hi rend="italic">Standards of
Bibliographical Description</hi>, 1949, pp. 3-60), the new incunable
may be described in these terms:
</p>

<p>Signature c4 is missigned c iij, and d4 is missigned d iij. Only
c1<hi rend="super">v</hi>, d2<hi rend="super">v</hi> and d3 have 29 lines. Hodnett
does not explain that
the cut on the title (his no. 313) is a pictorial representation of
the Allegory of the Four Daughters of God.</p>

<pb n="006.102"/>

<p>The only recorded copy is in the Pierpont Morgan Library
(<hi rend="italic">Check List</hi>, no. 1816A). It measures 193 x 138 mm. and is
stitched in the remains of the contemporary half-vellum binding.
Obtained by the Library in March, 1952 (Accession no. 43328).</p>
</q>

<p>Two other fifteenth-century editions of the <hi rend="italic">Abbey of the Holy
Ghost</hi> have long been known and are described by E. Gordon
Duff<ref target="f006.07.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref> under his numbers 1 and 2.
I
have been able to consult the edition identified as Duff 1 by using
the facsimile prepared from the copy in the University Library
Cambridge by Francis Jenkinson (published by the Cambridge
University Press in 1907), while the Folger Library has kindly
supplied me with a microfilm of their copy of the remaining edition
(Duff 2). With a view towards determining the order and approximate
date of the editions, it will be necessary to subject these not
only to a strict bibliographical scrutiny but to a thorough textual
examination as well. We may best begin by considering the physical
"make-up" of the editions which, for the sake of convenience, will
hereafter be cited as C (Cambridge), F (Folger) and M (Morgan).</p>
<p>As we may see from the description given above, M was printed
with only one column to the page while the other two editions were
each set up with double columns. One fount of type only (Wynkyn de
Worde no. 4) was used in the printing of M, whereas two different
sizes of type are found in both other editions (types 2 and 4 in C;
types 4 and 6 in F). Furthermore, C and F have a constant number of
lines (29) to the page; M usually has 28 though thrice 29 lines
were needed to accommodate the text. Similarly, on signature a4
verso of M, de Worde miscalculated the amount of text he could
crowd onto a page and was obliged to set a portion of the word
"ravisheth" in the position normally occupied by a catchword; thus,
by printing "ra&verbar;&verbar;uyssheth&verbar;&verbar;", he was able to get all the text
on that page. Again, while c4 and d4 are missigned in M as noted in
the above description, there are no errors in the signing of the
other editions. Finally, the text of M ends on the verso of the
last leaf,
whereas in both other editions the narrative concludes on the recto
and is followed in each case by a printer's device. All these
points suggest that M is the most primitive (and consequently the
earliest) of the three editions.</p>
<p>The evidence of the woodcuts, while inconclusive, at least
confirms the belief that C was printed before F. The woodcut of the
Crucifixion (Hodnett 374)<ref target="f006.07.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref> has
suffered greater material damage at the top of the

<pb n="006.103"/>

block in F than in C; in addition, the Folger copy shows the loss
of a border-line at the top and another at the bottom of this
cut.</p>
<p>If we now turn to the textual examination, it is clear that six
different arrangements for the successive order of appearance of
the editions are possible. Two series (C &rarr; M &rarr; F and F
&rarr; M &rarr; C) can be eliminated immediately, both for
typographical and for textual reasons. Since C and F were each
printed with double columns and always agree page-for-page (and
mostly line-for-line), it is self-evident that the one was set from
the other with no single-column edition intervening. The text too
corroborates this theory, as one example will suffice to indicate.
In line 4 of sig. c4<hi rend="super">v</hi>, M has the text
"&thorn;<hi rend="super">t</hi> were callid
Merci &amp; Pyte," while both C and F omit the word "callid". Now one
will find it difficult, probably impossible, to believe that the
second compositor could supply a needed word which in a third
printing was then again omitted, thus accidentally duplicating the
reading of the editio princeps. Yet one would be obliged to accept
this coincidence if the
order of appearance was either of those given above. No; one can
only conclude, on the basis of reasonable probability, either that
C was set from F or that the contrary took place.</p>
<p>The next two possibilities (C &rarr; F &rarr; M and M &rarr; F
&rarr; C) are equally unacceptable, for C and M often have the
identical text from which F alone departs. For example, in M (b1,
line 4) one reads: "For no man I trowe myght al fully it fele";
with this C completely agrees. In F (a6<hi rend="super">v</hi>, &bgr;, 17-18),
however,
we find: "for I trowe &thorn;<hi rend="super">t</hi> no man myght all fully it fele".
To
cite another example, M (a6<hi rend="super">v</hi>, lines 14-19) prints the
following:

<q>Our lorde Jh&umacr; Cryste sendyth them the oyle of comforte &amp;
of
mercy that gyueth the lyghte of &amp; shewyth his heuenly preuytees
&thorn;<hi rend="super">t</hi> he hydeth fro men that ben full of flesshly
lustes.</q>

While C offers this same text, F (a6<hi rend="super">v</hi>, &agr;, 16), sensing
an
omission, alone supplies the word "understanding", giving the
reading "lyght of vnderstandynge".</p>
<p>That M and C are textually related&mdash;and that the one was set
from the other&mdash;is convincingly demonstrated (if further proof be
needed) by a curious slip common to both; this does <hi rend="italic">not</hi>
occur in F. On b6<hi rend="super">v</hi>, lines 2-5, M reads:

<q>Therfore he was take &amp; put in to the pryson of hell. &amp;
there
hathe be now. M. yere &amp;. vi. C &amp; more. &amp; that is grete
pyte.</q>

With this reading C agrees, while F, in accordance with tradition,
correctly

<pb n="006.104"/>

asserts that, before the coming of Christ, Adam had languished in
Hell 4,600 and more years ("and there hath be now .iiij. M. yere
and .vi. C. and more"). Thus, if we assume that F intervenes
between C and M, we must believe that the error in time was
corrected for the Folger text only to have the third edition, by
sheer coincidence, make the identical error found in the first
printing.<ref target="f006.07.03" n="3"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref> The points here made
surely eliminate these two possibilities.</p>
<p>We thus arrive at the last two alternatives.
<ref target="f006.07.04" n="4"><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref> The series F &rarr; C &rarr; M
seems
improbable for typographical reasons. The state of the woodcuts
assures us that F is the latest of the three, and the typographical
"set-up" of M is certainly more primitive than the sophisticated
press-work of the other two editions. Textually too, this is
unlikely, for M and C exhibit older dialectal and orthographic
variants ("her", "syndre", and the habitual use of "wol") where F
offers the more modern forms ("theyr", "sondry", and usually
wyl").<ref target="f006.07.05" n="5"><hi rend="super">5</hi></ref></p>
<p>By this process of elimination we arrive at the conclusion that
the order M &rarr; C &rarr; F is the only possible one for the
appearance of the three editions of the <hi rend="italic">Abbey of the Holy
Ghost</hi>. Furthermore, there are an adequate number of pieces of
evidence to support this contention. In illustration of this, the
text in M (d3, lines 11-14) may be cited:

<q>Whan they wolde haue naylyd his fete to the crosse: all his body
was so shronke vp togyd) for payne &thorn;<hi rend="super">t</hi> it was to shorte
to
&thorn;<hi rend="super">e</hi> hole &thorn;<hi rend="super">t</hi> they had made by a
large fote.</q>

The term "too short to the hole" had been used a few lines earlier
in very similar circumstances; in that case, all three editions
employed this same phrase. In the instance previously cited,
however, both C and F substitute (d2<hi rend="super">v</hi>, &bgr;, 3) "to sort
for
&thorn;<hi rend="super">e</hi> hole", an apparent modernization introduced by the
later
printings.</p>

<pb n="006.105"/>

<p>The gradual deterioration of the text (M &rarr; C &rarr; F) is
amply demonstrated by one enlightening example.
<ref target="f006.07.06" n="6"><hi rend="super">6</hi></ref> In M (a6, lines 15-19) one reads:

<q>Medytacyon is thoughte in god / of his werkes: of his wordes /
&amp; of his creatures / &amp; of his paynes that he suffryd. &amp; of
his loue &thorn;<hi rend="super">t</hi> he louyd vs wyth / For ofte a good thoughte
is
better than many indeuowte prayers.</q>

This appears in C (a6, &agr;, 17-24), where the omission is clearly
due to haplography, as:<ref target="f006.07.07" n="7"><hi rend="super">7</hi></ref>

<q>Medytac&omacr;n is thought in god / of his werkes / of his wordes
/ &amp; of his creatures / &amp; of his paynes &thorn;<hi rend="super">t</hi> he
loued vs
with. For oft a good thought is better than many Indeuowte
prayers.</q>

The compositor of F, sensing a corruption of text, set about
"correcting" it, and with this in mind he substituted "losyd" for
"loued" (loved). In the special Biblical sense of "to loose" (NED
vb. I<hi rend="super">c</hi>) this emendation gave meaning to the passage
though it
did not result in a return to the original sense. The explanation
for the texts of C and F can only be made evident by assuming the
priority of M. Surely it is clear, from this lengthy analysis, that
the newly discovered copy of the <hi rend="italic">Abbey</hi> now in the Morgan
Library belongs to the earliest known printed edition of this
text.</p>
<p>A fortunate set of circumstances makes it possible to supply a
likely date for the several editions of the <hi rend="italic">Abbey of the Holy
Ghost</hi>. As we have seen, the Morgan copy of the
<hi rend="italic">Abbey</hi>
was
printed in a single column with de Worde's type 4; Duff I was set
up in two columns with types 2 and 4; and Duff 2 was issued with
double columns using types 4 and 6. Now the first edition of Bishop
John Alcock's <hi rend="italic">Mons perfectionis</hi> (Duff 12) was also printed
in one column with de Worde's type 4, while the second edition
(Duff 13) has double columns with types 2 and 4; a third edition
was issued by de Worde after he had left Westminster (STC 281). Are we not justified in assuming that the <hi rend="italic">Abbey</hi> and the
<hi rend="italic">Mons
perfectionis</hi>, being similar tracts of devotional literature,
were issued as companion pieces and that they were designed to be
sold either separately or together?
<ref target="f006.07.08" n="8"><hi rend="super">8</hi></ref> Since the first edition of the
<hi rend="italic">Mons
perfectionis</hi> has the
printed date 22 September 1496, and the second bears the date 23
May 1497, it is with

<pb n="006.106"/>

some confidence that one may assert that the first two editions of
the <hi rend="italic">Abbey</hi> were also produced, respectively, in September
1496 and May 1497.</p>
<p>The third edition of the <hi rend="italic">Mons perfectionis</hi> presents an
added complication in that it was printed after 1500, at a time
when Wynkyn de Worde had left Westminster and had moved to "the
City." According to Sayle (no. 144),
<ref target="f006.07.09" n="9"><hi rend="super">9</hi></ref> the volume states that it was
printed
in London "and fynysshed the xxvii. daye of &thorn;<hi rend="super">e</hi> moneth
of
Maye" 1501. We may well suppose that this book was intended to go
on sale together with the third edition of the <hi rend="italic">Abbey of the Holy
Ghost;</hi> consequently it is likely that little time had elapsed
between the printing of these two volumes. On the basis of this
reasoning, there is some justification for believing that the third
<hi rend="italic">Abbey</hi> (Duff 2) may well have been the last book printed by
Wynkyn de Worde at Westminster, just as the third <hi rend="italic">Mons
perfectionis</hi> is judged to be the first one issued by his new
press in London; in any case, no earlier book with a London imprint
has yet been
discovered.<ref target="f006.07.10" n="10"><hi rend="super">10</hi></ref></p>
<p>This discussion, then, offers what seems to be fairly conclusive
evidence in support of the contention that the Morgan copy of the
<hi rend="italic">Abbey of the Holy Ghost</hi> belongs to the first printed edition
of this work (at least, of those that are now known to us) and that
this work was probably printed by Wynkyn de Worde not much later
than 22 September 1496. In concluding this somewhat lengthy
account, one further observation may be made. If Duff's
bibliography (or if the <hi rend="italic">Gesamtkatalog der Wiegendrucke</hi>)
should ever be reprinted, the present edition of the <hi rend="italic">Abbey</hi>
will head the list of entries as the very first number, with the
Morgan copy cited as the only known example.</p>

<div2 type="section"><head></head>
<p>After R. B. McKerrow, in 1906, published the results of his
examination of Robert Greene's quarto, <hi rend="italic">A Quip for an Upstart
Courtier</hi> (1592), it was generally accepted that only two
editions of the tract appeared in the year of publication: one
(collating A-H<hi rend="super">4</hi>) with the attack on the Harveys, an 'issue'
with
the cancel of this passage, and other copies in which the collation
reads A-F<hi rend="super">4</hi>.<ref target="f006.08.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref> An
examination
of
all extant copies of the 1592 edition, however, reveals that at
least six editions appeared in that year. Copies in the Westminster
Abbey Library, the Harvard University Library, the Huntington
Library, the Folger Shakespeare Library, and the collection of Dr.
A. S. Rosenbach were found to be separate editions. Thus Greene's
intemperate criticism of Gabriel Harvey and his two brothers, John
and Richard, not only precipitated the vitriolic Harvey-Nashe
controversy, which continued for at least the next four years, but
also created a great
demand for the <hi rend="italic">Quip</hi>, which the printer had to meet by
rushing editions through the presses.</p>
<p>Since, beginning with the second edition, the collation remains
the same, and all copies are paginary reprints, occasionally with
the transfer of formes from one edition to another, the tract
presents difficult bibliographical problems, especially as to order
of printing. However, through scrutiny of variant readings and
through a line-by-line examination of type it is possible, I
believe, to establish a plausible order.</p>

<p>The two states of the first edition of the <hi rend="italic">Quip</hi> are
easily differentiated by means of the cancel of the attack on the
Harveys. Thus in Q1<hi rend="super">b</hi> the last two leaves of E signature
were
reset,<ref target="f006.08.06" n="6"><hi rend="super">6</hi></ref> and the lengthy side-note
on sig. E4 of Q1<hi rend="super">a</hi> threatening Richard Harvey with
ridicule in
the theater eliminated. The rest of Q1<hi rend="super">b</hi> has the typesettings
of
Q1<hi rend="super">a</hi>. In sheet F, however, two alterations were made. On
sig. F1,
a seventeen-line side-note was added (because of cropping I have
had to reconstruct the reading in part):

<q>Wel sho[uld] | the lords [of] | the Coun[cil] | do to loo[ke] |
to those b[ase] | knaue s[hoo-] | makers t[oo, who] | ioyne wi[th]
| coosenin[g] | curriers [a-]|gainst th[eir] | own com[pa-] | nie
to the [vn-]|doing of [ma-]|ny hones[t] | poore m[en] | of that
tr[ade.]</q>

And the passage on sig. F4<hi rend="super">v</hi> of Q1<hi rend="super">a</hi>
reading "And as for you
goodman Baker, that delight to be seen where most people resort,
euen on the pillory

<pb n="006.112"/>

in the cheefe market place. . . ." became in Q1<hi rend="super">b</hi> "And for
you
goodman Baker, you that are cosine to Christ in brooking the
pillorie as hee did the crosse. . . ." Two minor verbal changes
before and after the above passage were necessary in order to fill
out the lines of type. Since the running-titles are the same in
both states in sheet F, these changes were undoubtedly made while
Q1<hi rend="super">a</hi> was being run off. We cannot be positive on this
point
because only one copy of each state is extant.</p>
<p>When demand for the tract necessitated a second printing, the
work was reset in entirety: all ornaments and side-notes were
eliminated, and the number of gatherings reduced from eight to six.
Furthermore, except for the accidental omission of lines and the
usual orthographical changes when a work goes through many
printings, the text became standardized and is sharply
differentiated from Q1<hi rend="super">a-b</hi> because of five deletions made
presumably before Greene's death on September 3, 1592.
<ref target="f006.08.07" n="7"><hi rend="super">7</hi></ref> Since all later editions follow
Q1<hi rend="super">b</hi>
in removing the Harvey attack and in altering the phraseology of
the allusion to the bakers, Q1<hi rend="super">b</hi> obviously became the
copy-text.<ref target="f006.08.08" n="8"><hi rend="super">8</hi></ref> It should also be noted
that Q2-Q5 have the same title-page and the same typesetting on
sig.A2<hi rend="super">v</hi>. Catch-words and signatures, as the collations
above
indicate, are practically the same in Q2-Q6. In view of these
similarities, we may be certain that the different forms
of the <hi rend="italic">Quip</hi> were run off the presses within a short
time.</p>
<p>Because these later editions are paginary reprints, it will not
be possible to prove conclusively the order of printing.
Nevertheless, we can, I believe, arrive at a hypothetically correct
order. First, it is necessary to cite the evidence for Q2 as the
second edition:</p>

<list>
<item>(1) As the partial list of variant readings given below
reveals, Q2, more frequently than any of the other editions,
retains the phraseology of Q1<hi rend="super">b</hi>. (The first citations are
from Q1<hi rend="super">b</hi>-Q2, and the line references are from Q2; the latter
readings are from Q3-Q6.)

<list>
<item>A3 l. 4 cleere: cheere
            9 me: men</item>

<pb n="006.113"/>

<item>B1<hi rend="super">v</hi>  33 courtiers: country</item>

<item>B3    26 seing that: seeing</item>

<item>B3<hi rend="super">v</hi>   1 take: takes
            32 or other suts: in other sutes</item>

<item>B4    24 of hart: of the hart</item>

<item>B4<hi rend="super">v</hi>  21 wars: warre</item>

<item>D4     2 hides or backes: backs or hides
            28 a little heere: heere a little
            32 espied: spied</item>
</list></item>

<item>(2) On sig. A4, l. 11, of Q2, we find the reading: "the the
Deuill". This is an easily understood error if we turn to sig. B2
of Q1<hi rend="super">b</hi>, where the catch-word is "the" and the first two
words of
the next page "the Deuill". The printer probably set up "the" in
Q2, turned to the next page in Q1<hi rend="super">b</hi>, and composed "the
Deuill".
(Although Q1<hi rend="super">a-b</hi> have identical type-settings here, it seems
more
logical that Q1<hi rend="super">b</hi> was being followed, since, as I have
previously
noted, Q2 adopts all the emendations of the second issue of the
first edition.)</item>
</list>

<p>On the basis of this evidence, although it cannot be considered
conclusive, Q2 appears to be the second edition of the
pamphlet.<ref target="f006.08.09" n="9"><hi rend="super">9</hi></ref></p>
<p>To determine the order of the other printings, our best guide is
the use of standing type in the various editions. The chart below
shows graphically how typesettings were transferred from one
edition to another, beginning with Q3. (I have not noted in this
chart that sigs. A1 and A2<hi rend="super">v</hi> are identical in Q2-Q5.)</p>


<p>
 <!-- <figure entity="sb061131"></figure> -->
</p>

<p>That Q3 is a later edition than Q2 is proven by the fact that in
Q3 the

<pb n="006.114"/>

standing type from Q2 has been altered for correction on every
page, except on sig. E1, which is a new setting, and on sig F1,
which is identical.<ref target="f006.08.10" n="10"><hi rend="super">10</hi></ref> A line
inadvertently omitted on sig. E4<hi rend="super">v</hi> of Q2 is restored in Q3.
<ref target="f006.08.11" n="11"><hi rend="super">11</hi></ref> In addition, the compositor of Q3
followed the settings of signatures C and D in Q2, as illustrated
by the unusual appearance of a half line of type on the signature
line of sig. D1:

<q>
<l>vppon precept to arrest mee, D hath</l>
</q>

The printing history of Q3, then, can be easily reconstructed. When
John Wolfe decided to run off a third edition of the <hi rend="italic">Quip,</hi>
he found the standing type of sheets E and F of Q2. Since the type
of sig. E1 had been disturbed, he had that page reset and obvious
typographical errors on the other pages corrected.</p>
<p>Then, when the popularity of the tract necessitated a fourth
printing, Wolfe found that the standing type of sheets A and B from
Q3 was still intact and could be used in Q4. However, because type
had been disturbed, sig. B1 in entirety, the running-titles of
sigs. B2<hi rend="super">v</hi> and B4<hi rend="super">v</hi>, and the catchword of
sig. B4<hi rend="super">v</hi> had to be
reset. Although the changes made during the resetting of sig. B1 do
not necessarily indicate that Q4 is later than Q3,
<ref target="f006.08.12" n="12"><hi rend="super">12</hi></ref> the number of variant readings
introduced in this printing points to this conclusion. Another
argument for the correctness of the order of printing outlined here
is the appearance of the broken <hi rend="italic">h</hi> in "shall" on sig. C2, l.
29, of Q5, the inner forme of this signature being the same in Q4
and Q5.</p>
<p>Q4 and Q5 are even more closely related than the chart above
indicates. In sheet A, not only are sigs. A1 and A2<hi rend="super">v</hi>
identical
settings, but also the same typesetting appears on sig. A2, with
the exception of these corrections (the readings from Q4 appear
first): l. 1 Burnabie: Barnabie l. 8 theit: their. The second
correction indicates the priority of Q4. And, as

<pb n="006.115"/>

the chart illustrates, C(i) and one-half (1<hi rend="super">v</hi>, 4) of F(i) have
identical typesettings. ("FINIS" on sig. F4 appears lower on the
page in Q5.) In addition, the catch-words in these two editions are
the same with these two exceptions (the readings from Q4 appear
first): B3<hi rend="super">v</hi> match: Italian; D1 mace: hath. Moreover, a
tabulation of the last two words of lines toward the middle of the
page (one page from each forme of each signature) reveals
differences only on sigs. B4 and C2<hi rend="super">v</hi>. (The compositor of
Q5,
after referring to Q1<hi rend="super">b</hi>-Q3, restored a line omitted on sig.
B4 of
Q4.)<ref target="f006.08.13" n="13"><hi rend="super">13</hi></ref></p>
<p>Q6 is easily distinguished from the editions we have examined,
for on the title-page the setting of "A | QVIP FOR AN VP-| &longs;tart
Courtier:" is different in this printing,
<ref target="f006.08.14" n="14"><hi rend="super">14</hi></ref> and sig. A2<hi rend="super">v</hi>,
identical in Q2-Q5,
has been reset. In addition, the initial <hi rend="italic">I</hi> on sig. A3 has a
noticeable break in the upper left-hand corner, not apparent in
Q2-Q5. Q6 is also characterized by attempts at perfection of the
text in regard to orthography ("ancient" for "antient," for
example), consistent capitalization of proper names, new paragraph
divisions and proper indentation of the paragraph beginning on l.
16 of sig. B4 (previously not indented), and more logical
punctuation throughout the tract. Since catch-words and
line-endings are usually the same in Q4-Q6, it is not possible to
ascertain whether Q6 follows Q4 or Q5. The line irregularities
noted in the collation point to Q4, but, on the basis of the
variant readings, Q5 seems the more logical candidate, as
in at least twenty-four instances Q6 retains readings which appear
first in Q5.</p>
<p>Further proof that the order of printing outlined here is
substantially correct is furnished by the transfer of
running-titles from edition to edition. If we look at the
collations, we see that "A quippe for | for an vp&longs;tart Courtier."
appears five times in Q2 and Q3, once in Q4, and not at all in Q5
and Q6. We also find that erroneous running-titles are gradually
eliminated, until in Q6 there is complete uniformity.</p>
<p>Thus, on the basis of the transfer of formes and running-titles,
the introduction of variant readings, and attempts at perfection,
particularly in Q6, the printing history of the <hi rend="italic">Quip</hi> in 1592
appears to be clear. Moreover, after careful examination of all
extant copies of the tract printed in this year, we have definite
evidence that at least six editions, rather than two as heretofore
supposed, appeared in 1592. Finally, this bibliographical analysis
of the pamphlet demonstrates that it caused no small sensation

<pb n="006.116"/>

in London literary circles, probably because of the vicious attack
on the Harveys, and that Greene himself was an unusually popular
writer in the Elizabethan era.<ref target="f006.08.15" n="15"><hi rend="super">15</hi></ref></p>

<name type="title">The Printing of John Webster's Plays (I)</name>
<lb/><hi rend="italic">by</hi><lb/> <name type="author">John Russell
Brown</name>
</head>

<div2 type="section"><head></head>
<p>Anyone wishing to make a close study of the plays of John
Webster will soon find himself involved in textual and
bibliographical investigations.<ref target="f006.09.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref>
For instance, F. L. Lucas' edition of 1927 deals with questions of
textual authority, but since Lucas wrote, critical bibliography and
the study of dramatic manuscripts have so developed that his
answers can no longer be trusted. These studies have posed new
questions as well as developing new techniques for answering old
ones; so, while Lucas was content to follow Dyce in noting a few
variants in copies of the first quartos, a present-day student will
require a complete survey of the known copies and will wish to
analyse them rigorously.</p>
<p>This paper, and one which should follow shortly, attempt to
bring the study of Webster's text a little more up-to-date. They
will deal with <hi rend="italic">The White Devil, The Duchess of Malfi,</hi> and
<hi rend="italic">The Devil's Law Case,</hi> the three plays which Webster
authenticated by his interest in publication. Each play exists in
a single authoritative text and the first task must concern the
nature of the copy which lies behind these texts. Such enquiries
are not strictly bibliographical, but they are necessary
preliminaries and illustrate the fact that, as an applied science,
Bibliography must often work in conjunction with other skills, less
scientific in their method and less certain in their conclusions.
Since bibliographical problems are seldom self-contained, these
studies will often be hampered by the lack of knowledge about
related texts; on the other hand, they may help forward other work.
Nicholas Okes, the printer of <hi rend="italic">The White Devil</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The

Duchess of Malfi,</hi> also printed
the 'Pied Bull' quarto of <hi rend="italic">King Lear</hi> and the 1622 quarto of

<pb n="006.118"/>

<hi rend="italic">Othello,</hi> and therefore knowledge about his compositors will
possibly add to our knowledge of these Shakespeare texts. I hope to
show that <hi rend="italic">The Duchess of Malfi</hi> was printed from a transcript

by Ralph Crane: the evidence for this may influence similar
hypotheses about plays in the 1623 Shakespeare folio. Certain press
corrections in <hi rend="italic">The Duchess</hi> also relate to this problem.
<ref target="f006.09.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref></p>
<p>The known facts about the publication of <hi rend="italic">The White
Devil</hi>
can be briefly summarized. The title-page records that the play was
<hi rend="italic">'Acted by the Queenes Maiesties Seruants'</hi> and 'Written by
Iohn Webster'. The imprint is <hi rend="italic">'LONDON,</hi> / Printed by
<hi rend="italic">N.O.</hi> for <hi rend="italic">Thomas Archer,</hi> and are to be sold
/ at his
Shop in Popes head Pallace, neere the / Royall Exchange. 1612.'
Following the title-page is a preface 'To the Reader' written by
the author who also added a short note at the end of the text. The
date of composition was probably early 1612 or the winter of
1612-13.<ref target="f006.09.03" n="3"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref> At this date there was
nothing unusual in early publication or in the author providing
prefatory material; apparently a custom had developed which
permitted playwrights to have a 'double sale of their labours,
first to the Stage, and after to the presse'.
<ref target="f006.09.04" n="4"><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref> Shakespeare and Beaumont and
Fletcher
seem to be exceptional in not taking advantage
of this custom; <hi rend="italic">The Faithfull Shepherdess</hi> was, however,
quickly published with an epistle and three dedicatory verses by
the author, after its failure on the stage in 1608 or 1609.
<ref target="f006.09.05" n="5"><hi rend="super">5</hi></ref> It follows that the early publication

of <hi rend="italic">The White Devil</hi> with an author's preface proves very
little by itself; it must be considered together with other plays
performed by the same company of players at the same time.</p>
<p>There are only five other plays printed between 1608 and 1616
whose title-pages assert that they were acted by the Queen's
Majesty's Servants. One of these, Heywood's <hi rend="italic">The Four Prentices
of London,</hi> was an old play when published in 1615. The other
four were more or less recent, and, for each of them, prefatory
matter explains something of how they came to be published. The
earliest, Heywood's <hi rend="italic">The Rape of Lucrece,</hi> was published in
1608 after it had been duly entered in the Stationers' Register on
3 June. The author, in a preface 'To the Reader', excuses the
publication of his play on the grounds that

<q>some of my plaies haue (vnknown to me, and without any of my
direction) accidentally come into the Printers handes, and therfore
so corrupt and mangled, (copied

<pb n="006.119"/>

onely by the eare) that I haue bene as vnable to know them, as
ashamde to chalenge them. This therefore I was the willinger to
furnish out in his natiue habit: first beeing by consent, next
because the rest haue beene so wronged in beeing publisht in such
sauadge and ragged ornaments.</q>

Heywood's <hi rend="italic">The Golden Age,</hi> published in 1611 after entry
in
the Stationers' Register on 14 October, is excused as "comming
accidentally to the Presse', the author only afterwards 'hauing
notice thereof'. Dekker's <hi rend="italic">If it be not Good, the Devil is in
It</hi> was published in 1612 and dedicated to 'my louing, and loued
friends and fellowes, the Queenes Maiesties seruants.' <hi rend="italic">Greene's
Tu Quoque,</hi> which was probably written in 1611,
<ref target="f006.09.06" n="6"><hi rend="super">6</hi></ref> was published in 1614 following
the
death of the actor Thomas Greene; this is marked by the inclusion
of an elegy by 'W.R.' and a brief character by Thomas Heywood.</p>
<p>From these four plays, it would seem that about the year 1612
the publication of a new play as from the repertory of the Queen's
Majesty's Servants needed some sort of excuse, apology, or special
dedication. Yet <hi rend="italic">The White Devil's</hi> preface shows an
independent attitude, critical of the theatre in which this company
was habitually acting:

<q><hi rend="italic">IN</hi> publishing this Tragedy, I do but challenge to my
selfe that liberty, which other men haue tane before mee; not that
I affect praise by it, for, <hi rend="italic">nos h&oelig;c nouimus esse nihil,</hi>
onely since it was acted, in so dull a time of Winter, presented in
so open and blacke a Theater, that it wanted (that which is the
onely grace and setting out of a Tragedy) a full and vnderstanding
Auditory: and that since that time I haue noted, most of the people
that come to that Play-house, resemble those ignorant asses (who
visiting Stationers shoppes their vse is not to inquire for good
bookes, but new bookes) I present it to the generall veiw . . .
.</q>

This independent attitude and Webster's desire to justify his play,
do not suggest publication by common consent like the other Queen's
Servants' plays; it is more like the independence of Jonson's
epistles and dedications,<ref target="f006.09.07" n="7"><hi rend="super">7</hi></ref> or
Fletcher's justification of <hi rend="italic">The Faithfull Shepherdess</hi>. This
gives the first clue to the nature of the copy used by the printer;
it was more likely to come from the author than from the players'
company.</p>
<p>But the real argument must be based on the bibliographical and
textual peculiarities of the printed play. Lucas made deductions
from one such detail; in a note on <hi rend="italic">'Enter Senate'</hi>
(I.i.59-60; B2) he suggested that, 'like several others in the
play', this entry may be premature and due to the text having been
'set up from a prompt-copy.' But then he pointed out that this is
not certain

<pb n="006.120"/>

<q>if the play is thought of as performed continuously with no more
break between Scenes 1 and 2 than the drawing of a curtain. For
then the trumpets may quite well be heard at this point.
<ref target="f006.09.08" n="8"><hi rend="super">8</hi></ref></q>

Whatever the verdict about this particular entry, the 'several
other' entries which may be premature must be considered. Not
counting grouped entries like those at the beginning of new scenes,
there are some 50 entries in the play; and in 19 of these,
characters are directed to enter before they are due to speak or be
spoken to.</p>
<p>The examination of manuscript prompt-books has given surer
grounds for the analysis of this kind of evidence. It seems that
the

<q>prompter repeating an author's direction in the left margin
usually places it opposite the original, approximately at least .
. ., and the reviser draws a line to mark the exact spot where they
belong. Occasionally, however, he marks an entry a few lines
earlier than the author had done. It is not that he writes the
direction in advance of the actual entry, for his line shows that
it is the entrance itself that he has advanced. Clearly his
intention is to bring the characters on at the back of the stage a
few moments earlier in order that they may be able to enter into
the dialogue at the correct point.
<ref target="f006.09.09" n="9"><hi rend="super">9</hi></ref></q>

In this way, a prompt-book copy could bring about occasional
premature entries in a printed text; but so could several other
kinds of copy. First, as Lucas suggested, the dramatist might have
a reason for marking the entries early; plausible reasons could be
suggested for all such entries in <hi rend="italic">The White Devil</hi>. Secondly,
a scribe could be responsible although he was not preparing a
prompt-book; the Lansdowne manuscript of Middleton's <hi rend="italic">A Game at
Chess</hi> which is in the hand of Ralph Crane and based ultimately
on Middleton's own papers, has an entry two lines before the
Trinity manuscript which is in the author's autograph
(I.i.212).<ref target="f006.09.10" n="10"><hi rend="super">10</hi></ref> Again Crane's
transcript of <hi rend="italic">Demetrius and Enanthe</hi> gives directions a line
or two earlier than the Folio version of 1647,
<ref target="f006.09.11" n="11"><hi rend="super">11</hi></ref> and yet the "evidence seems to
suggest
that the folio text represents the theatrical version of the play,
and that Crane's transcript was made from the
author's draft&mdash;probably the foul papers."
<ref target="f006.09.12" n="12"><hi rend="super">12</hi></ref> Thirdly, premature entries can be
due
to the carelessness of a compositor or writer of the copy, even
when the latter is the author. The misplacing of the directions
<hi rend="italic">'he writes'</hi> (IV.i.128; G2<hi rend="super">v</hi>) and <hi rend="italic">'Exit
Flamineo'</hi>

<pb n="006.121"/>

(V.iii.216; K3<hi rend="super">v</hi>) in the present play, where both seem to
be a
line or two late, could hardly derive from prompt-book copy. In the
first example, there is plenty of room to the right of the text at
the correct point, so the error was not dictated by the
compositor's convenience. Because of the variety of ways in which
they could arise, premature entries cannot indicate the type of
copy used by the printers.</p>
<p>More positive evidence comes from the suggestion that 'a copy
intended for use in the theatre would surely, of necessity, be
accurate and unambiguous in the matter of the character-names.' If
this be so, it follows that

<q>a play in which the names are irregular was printed from the
author's original MS., and that one in which they are regular and
uniform is more likely to have been printed from some sort of fair
copy, perhaps made by a professional scribe.
<ref target="f006.09.13" n="13"><hi rend="super">13</hi></ref></q>

<hi rend="italic">The White Devil</hi> has the following variations in speech
directions:

<list>
<item>1. Lodovico is signified by 'LOD.' or 'LODO.' and also by
'CAR.' which represents the name Carlo which he assumes in
disguise: LODO I.i.2; B1, CAR V.i.61; I1, LOD V.i.66; I1, CAR
V.ii.31; I3<hi rend="super">v</hi>, and LOD V.iii.68; K1<hi rend="super">v</hi>.
<ref target="f006.09.14" n="14"><hi rend="super">14</hi></ref></item>

<item>2. Gasparo likewise, is usually signified by 'GAS.' or
'GASP.', but changes to 'PED.' for Pedro. Later the disguise names
of the two conspirators become confused, and he seems to be
signified by 'CON.' and 'CAR.', the former probably being a
misreading of the copy's <hi rend="italic">Car.</hi>: GAS I.i.9; B1, PED V.i.63;
I1, GAS V.iii.137; K2<hi rend="super">v</hi>, CON V.vi.172; M1, GAS
V.vi.184; M1, and
CAR V.vi.228; M1<hi rend="super">v</hi>.</item>

<item>3. Zanche, usually 'ZAN.', changes to 'MOO.' or 'MOORE.':
ZAN

ZAN V.vi.23; L3, MOO

Dr. P. Williams has shown that two compositors set the text of
<hi rend="italic">The White Devil,</hi><ref target="f006.09.15" n="15"><hi rend="super">15</hi></ref> but

the
character names vary inside the work of a single compositor; for
instance 'A' was responsible for a change from Vittoria to
Corombona (E1 and H4), and for that from Doctor to Julio
(D2<hi rend="super">v</hi>
and 4<hi rend="super">v</hi>). In neither case could the change have been
suggested by
the occurrence of the new form in the dialogue. It is probable that
the copy was responsible for these variations and, if so, it is
unlikely to have been a manuscript used as a prompt-book.</p>
<p>More evidence comes from some character names which have no
significance in the text of the play and yet are found in stage
directions and entries; they are <hi rend="italic">'little</hi> Iaques <hi rend="italic">the
Moore'</hi> (II.i.Entry; C2<hi rend="super">v</hi>), Christophero and
Guid-antonio
(II.ii. Ist Dumb Show; D4<hi rend="super">v</hi>), and Farnese (V.i.40; I1).
These
names might be accounted for in two ways: either the copy was
derived from foul papers which retained undeveloped ideas or traces
of an unknown source, or else it represented a theatrical
abridgement of the original play. The former seems more likely as
neither Iaques nor Farnese has any part in the action of the play
and their presence among the entries would be an unnecessary
complication which a prompter would hardly permit when a stroke of
the pen could set the matter right.
<ref target="f006.09.16" n="16"><hi rend="super">16</hi></ref> These 'ghost' characters may,
therefore, support the theory that the copy derived from a
non-theatrical source, which was related to the author's foul
papers.</p>
<p>Errors in the printed text can also indicate the type of copy
used. As far as the spoken word is concerned, the copy for <hi rend="italic">The
White Devil</hi> must have been very good, for there are only two
minor points where the sense is in doubt,
<ref target="f006.09.17" n="17"><hi rend="super">17</hi></ref> and there is no essential correction

that cannot be explained as a graphic or compositor's error. It is
only in the stage directions etc. that the errors must derive from
the copy itself. In the speech directions, for instance, the
confusion of the disguise names has already been noticed and there
are also omissions and misplacings: 'GIO' (vanni) and 'MONT'
(icelso) are once given a line late (III.ii.339; F3, and IV.iii.93;
H3<hi rend="super">v</hi>), and 'LAW' (yer) and perhaps 'BRAC' (hiano) are
omitted
(III.ii.11; E2<hi rend="super">v</hi>, and

<pb n="006.123"/>

V.i.60; I1). The compositor might be responsible for the omissions,
but the misplacings are probably due to the copy and suggest that
it was not a theatrical one:

<q>In all manuscripts intended for stage use every speech begins a
fresh line of writing, irrespective of the metrical division. . .
. The speakers' names are in the margin, and the beginning of
speeches are not indented as is usual in print, but a short
horizontal rule is drawn separating the speeches.
<ref target="f006.09.18" n="18"><hi rend="super">18</hi></ref></q>

With such markings, a theatrical manuscript should be clear about
the beginning of each speech. On the other hand, Addition 'D' of
<hi rend="italic">Sir Thomas More,</hi> the only considerable foul paper extant,
shows the omission both of a speech rule and of a speech
direction.<ref target="f006.09.19" n="19"><hi rend="super">19</hi></ref> It would seem,
therefore, that the copy for <hi rend="italic">The White Devil</hi> was nearer in
these respects to the foul paper addition of <hi rend="italic">Sir Thomas More</hi>
than to any surviving prompt-book. The inclusion of a redundant
speech direction for 'VIT' (toria) (III.ii.273; F2) is most
credibly accounted for in the same way.</p>





<p>The omission of entries such as Isabella's at II.i.147
(C4<hi rend="super">v</hi>),
Gasparo's at III.iii.79(F4), Francisco's at V.ii.44(I4), and the
torch bearers' at the beginning of I.ii (B2), could be compositors'
errors, but Addition 'D' of <hi rend="italic">Sir Thomas More</hi> also shows this
kind of fault (F. 8a,l.139). When an entry is marked for
<hi rend="italic">'others'</hi> in a context which requires specific characters,
the copy is more surely at fault. This occurs at the beginning of
V.iii(I4<hi rend="super">v</hi>) where <hi rend="italic">'others'</hi> must include
Francisco,
Lodovico, Gasparo, Vittoria, and Giovanni, and at line 81 of the
same scene (K1<hi rend="super">v</hi>) where Gasparo is specifically required.
These
omissions could scarcely be due to a theatrical manuscript, so once
more there is evidence of foul papers behind the printed text.
<ref target="f006.09.20" n="20"><hi rend="super">20</hi></ref></p>
<p>The restriction of these 'copy errors' to the stage directions
etc. implies the use of a copy which was fair with regard to the
spoken word, but foul with regard to its adaptation for use in a
theatre. Such a copy might be in the possession of the author.
Webster in 'To the Reader' confesses he 'was a long time in
finishing this Tragedy', and he was obviously a careful and
detailed worker; he might well have made a fair copy of the text of
his play before the final copy was made for the players with stage
movements

<pb n="006.124"/>

clearly indicated. If so, he had only to prepare this personal copy
when he wished to justify his play by publication. Alternatively,
the play might have been given to the players in this unprepared
form and the bookkeeper then made another copy for use as a
prompt-book. There are two arguments against this second theory;
first, the circumstances of printing make it unlikely that the copy
was the property of the players, and secondly, there are further
errors in the stage directions which imply that the copy was
originally less adapted to the stage than the printed text
suggests.</p>
<p>Among these further errors are five duplicate entries:

<list>
<item>1. <hi rend="italic">'Enter . . . Camillo.'</hi> (II.i.227;
D1<hi rend="super">v</hi>) which
occurs later, and correctly, at line 280 (D2<hi rend="super">v</hi>).</item>

<item>2. <hi rend="italic">'Enter Francisco, . . . . At another dore the Duke of
Florence.'</hi> (IV.iii.Entry; H2).</item>

<item>3. <hi rend="italic">'Enter Monticelso.'</hi> (IV.iii.86-7;
H3<hi rend="super">v</hi>) which
is
made redundant by a proof correction of the text earlier
(IV.iii.82; H3).</item>

<item>4. <hi rend="italic">'Enter Duke Brachiano.'</hi> (V.i.30;
H4<hi rend="super">v</hi>) which
occurs later, and probably correctly, at line 40 (I1).</item>

<item>5. <hi rend="italic">'Enter Lod. Gasp. Pedro, Carlo.'</hi> (V.vi.167;
L4<hi rend="super">v</hi>); here the conspirators are given both their real and
assumed names.</item>
</list>

These can hardly be considered as duplications made by a prompter
because the redundant entry in 1. is part of a correctly timed
group entry and in 3. it is later than the correct one. They are
more likely to be due to foul papers or else they are signs of a
hurried correction of the copy for the press. Such corrections
might be necessary in a copy which had not been prepared for use in
the theatre; the interest of the author in publication suggests
that, in this case, he would be his own corrector.</p>
<p>Isabella's entry at the beginning of III.ii (E2) is another
error which implies a revision of the copy. More than fifty years
ago, Sir Walter Greg considered this was due to a prompt-book copy;
pointing out that Isabella is killed in the first dumb show of
II.ii, he thought that "Zanche was intended, one actor playing the
two parts, and the direction finding its way in from the stage
copy."<ref target="f006.09.21" n="21"><hi rend="super">21</hi></ref> But this explanation will
not fit all the facts. In the first place, there is a similar
confusion in the exit at the end of IV.i (G2<hi rend="super">v</hi>) where
<hi rend="italic">'Mon.'</hi> is printed for <hi rend="italic">'Fran.'</hi>&mdash;two parts
which
could
not possibly be doubled. Secondly, if Zanche and Isabella were
doubled, it would require four changes of the black make-up. If a
prompt-book is not able to explain Isabella's entry, neither can
foul papers if they merely represented an original draft of the
play. In the scene which follows the entry, Vittoria is tried for
the murder of Isabella, and
the whole trial is a direct

<pb n="006.125"/>

consequence of that murder; it is therefore hard to imagine how
Webster could include Isabella among the entrants in his original
draft. The entry might have been added, however, during a hurried
revision without reference to the prompt-book; if the author
undertook this, one must suppose that it was some time after the
initial composition. Only the errors of such a revision will be
evident in the printed text and all the true corrections will pass
unnoticed; this means that the copy must have been less fair than
the quarto suggests. It is less likely to have been the copy given
by the author to the players, and some kind of foul papers in the
author's possession is a more probable source.</p>
<p>The revision of the copy receives additional support from the
presence of stage directions in the outside margins of the printed
text:

Among the plays known to be printed by Nicholas Okes before 1616,
there are four with similar marginal directions, and in each case
they are much fewer in number. In Jonson's <hi rend="italic">The Case is
Altered</hi> (1609) there are two: <hi rend="italic">'Exit Oni'</hi> (sig. A4)
during prose speeches where there is no room in the text space, and
<hi rend="italic">Exunt'</hi> (D2) more inexplicably, at the end of a scene. In the
'Pied Bull' quarto of <hi rend="italic">Lear</hi> (1608), there are three marginal
entries, two

<pb n="006.126"/>

during prose speeches and one where the verse runs to the full
extent of the text space (C2<hi rend="super">v</hi>, D3<hi rend="super">v</hi>, and
F3). Daborne's <hi rend="italic">A
Christian Turned Turk</hi> (1612) has only one descriptive direction
in the margin (H3) where there is no room in the text space. In
Marston's <hi rend="italic">The Insatiate Countess,</hi> of which Okes printed only

the second edition in 1616, three descriptive directions are
repeated in the margin, as in the first edition of 1613 (B1, D3,
and E2). These last two plays have other long descriptive
directions in the text space, so that Okes's printing house seems
to have relegated directions to the margin only when there was no
room to the right of the text. None of these four plays can
parallel the marginal directions in <hi rend="italic">The White Devil,</hi> and in
<hi rend="italic">The Duchess of Malfi</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Devil's Law
Case</hi>
the
margins are not used at all.</p>
<p>The departure from normal practice in <hi rend="italic">The White Devil</hi>

would mean extra trouble for the printer; directions would have to
be composed separately from the main text, and added while the type
for one complete forme was being fitted into its skeleton. The
frisket would need to be specially cut for each forme with marginal
directions. Subsequent editions of the play show how printers
usually avoided such extra trouble. In the quarto of 1631, which is
reproduced, with corrections, page for page from the first, four of
the marginal directions are omitted altogether (1, 2, 3, and 5) and
six are fitted into the text space (4, 6, 8, 9, 10, and 13). In the
quarto of 1665, which again corresponds page for page with its
predecessors, four more are fitted into the text space (11, 12, 14,
and 15). The position of the remaining one (7, a and b) is
regularized in the larger quarto pages of the 1672 edition. There
must have been some special reason for placing directions in the
margin
of the first quarto.</p>
<p>It was not simply a question of convenience, for six of the
marginal directions could easily fit into the text space (3, 9, 10,
12, 14, and 15). Nor was the practice adopted completely for a few
selected formes; with one exception (F, inner) all those which have
marginal directions have normally placed ones as well. The
directions themselves give no clue, for no distinction in kind
seems to dictate where they are placed; for instance the marginal
<hi rend="italic">'Brachiano seemes heare neare his end. . . .'</hi> (6) is
paralleled in the equally descriptive and normally placed
<hi rend="italic">'Francisco speakes this as in scorne.'</hi> (III.ii.49-50; E3).
Again, the marginal <hi rend="italic">'These speches are seuerall kinds of
distractions . . . . .'</hi> (5) is paralleled in <hi rend="italic">'Cornelia doth
this in seuerall formes of distraction.'</hi> (V.iv.90-3;
L1<hi rend="super">v</hi>).
The marginal directions cannot be considered as merely descriptive,
for one includes an entry which marks the beginning of a new scene
(11).</p>
<p>All these factors mean that certain directions were placed in
the outer margins of the printed page for reasons other than that
of space or subject matter. Their position in the book can
elucidate this. Both compositors

<pb n="006.127"/>

placed some directions in the text space; at first only compositor
'B' used the margins, but in the last sheet but one, 'A' also
adopted this arrangement. Except for two entries during prose
speeches and the short direction <hi rend="italic">'Reades the letter.'</hi> (3),
all the marginal directions occur after sig. G. This means that
they were used more frequently towards the end of the play, and
after a stage direction had been added during proof-correction
(<hi rend="italic">viz. 'presents Fran. with a booke'</hi> IV.i.46-7;
G1<hi rend="super">v</hi>).
<ref target="f006.09.23" n="23"><hi rend="super">23</hi></ref> They were not a product of this
proof-correction, for both formes of sig. K have variant readings
and yet the marginal directions are present in all states; two of
them show minor corrections.</p>
<p>The explanation which most readily offers itself is the one
already brought forward to account for other peculiarities of the
text&mdash;that a copy of the play which had not been prepared for use
in a theatre was hurriedly corrected for the press in this respect.
Possibly the corrector marked some of the additions in a
distinctive way, so that after one of them had been omitted by
error of the compositor (i.e. on G1<hi rend="super">v</hi>), the others could be
easily distinguished for addition to the type when each forme was
ready for imposition. They may have been written in the left hand
margin, or else marked off in rules by the corrector. The nature
and extent of these directions suggest that the corrector was the
author himself and that he aimed at preparing the text for a
reader. Numbers 5 and 6 especially bear this out: <hi rend="italic">'Brachiano
seemes heare neare his end.'</hi> is clearly not a prompter's
direction and is unlike an author's direction to the actors; it
sounds precisely like a description
of action for the benefit of a reader and is perhaps the strongest
argument for the revision of the copy before going to press.</p>
<p>It has already been implied that the marginal directions do not
represent the full extent of the revision and this is borne out by
the form of some normally placed directions. As well as those
quoted above, one on K2<hi rend="super">v</hi> appears to have been written
expressly
for a reader: <hi rend="italic">'Heare the rest being departed Lodouico and
Gasparo discouer themselues.'</hi> (V.iii.148-51). Some literary
directions are found copied into manuscript prompt-books,
<ref target="f006.09.24" n="24"><hi rend="super">24</hi></ref> and normally their presence in a
printed text is no positive evidence for the nature of the copy,
but in this case, the large number of directions and the special
form of some of them do suggest that an attempt was made to present
the action clearly to a reader.</p>
<p>In conclusion there are two less positive indications of the
type of copy used; first, the absence of act and scene divisions.
In this <hi rend="italic">The White Devil</hi> is different from most of the other
plays performed and printed about

<pb n="006.128"/>

the year 1612. Out of 33 non-academic plays first published between
the end of 1609 and 1616, only five recently performed plays have
no trace of either act or scene division.
<ref target="f006.09.25" n="25"><hi rend="super">25</hi></ref> An interpretation of this peculiarity

comes from Sir Walter Greg's analysis of eighteen manuscript
prompt-books:

<q>sixteen are as they stand divided into acts, and just half of
these have the scenes also marked and numbered. The only two left
wholly undivided are <hi rend="italic">Sir Thomas More</hi> and <hi rend="italic">John of
Bordeaux,</hi> both early pieces, the former of which was probably
never performed.<ref target="f006.09.26" n="26"><hi rend="super">26</hi></ref></q>

Because <hi rend="italic">The White Devil</hi> is without any division it is
probable, though on negative evidence, that its copy did not
originate from a prompt-book. The second point is that no stage
direction relates solely to the preparation of stage properties:
such a direction would imply a theatrical origin for the copy.</p>
<p>As a whole, the evidence leads to the conclusion that <hi rend="italic">The
White Devil</hi> was printed from a non-theatrical manuscript which
was probably in the author's possession. This manuscript was fair
with regard to the spoken word, but among the stage directions and
speech directions there were marks of an author's foul papers.
Before publication the copy had to be revised in these respects,
and this was probably undertaken by the author in a hurried and
incomplete manner. The copy for <hi rend="italic">The White Devil</hi> was
therefore authoritative and represented the play as the author
wrote it rather than as it was performed on the stage. As a kind of
foul paper, it may have been in the author's own handwriting.</p>
<p>Most of the direct evidence about the publication of <hi rend="italic">The
Duchess of Malfi</hi> is contained in the preliminary matter of the
first quarto. The title-page reads:

<q>THE / TRAGEDY / <hi rend="italic">OF THE DVTCHESSE</hi> /
<hi rend="italic">Of</hi> Malfy. /
<hi rend="italic">As it was Presented priuatly, at the Black- / Friers; and
publiquely at the Globe, By the</hi> / Kings Maiesties Seruants. /
The perfect and exact Coppy, with diuerse / <hi rend="italic">things Printed, that
the length of the Play would</hi> / not beare in the Presentment. /
VVritten by <hi rend="italic">John Webster</hi>. / [Quotation] / [rule] /
<hi rend="italic">LONDON:</hi> / Printed by Nicholas Okes, for Iohn / Waterson,
and
are to be sold at the / signe of the Crowne, in <hi rend="italic">Paules</hi> /
Churchyard, 1623.</q></p>
<p>Although similar notes are comparatively rare, the reference to
the 'perfect and exact Coppy' cannot carry much weight by itself.
For instance, on the title-pages of two quartos of <hi rend="italic">The Maid's
Tragedy</hi> there are notes on

<pb n="006.129"/>

the textual authority which have no justification at all. Although
quartos 6 and 7 boast that they are 'Revised and Corrected exactly
by the Original', they are really reproduced from quarto 3, as
quartos 4 and 5 had been before.<ref target="f006.09.27" n="27"><hi rend="super">27</hi></ref>
If the claim for an 'original' or 'true' copy seems justified on
any one occasion, the exact interpretation of the words often
remains difficult. For example, the 1604/5 quarto of <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi>
claims to be 'according to the true and perfect Coppie', and in
this case there is a 'high probability that the copy . . . . was
Shakespeare's own manuscript.'<ref target="f006.09.28" n="28"><hi rend="super">28</hi></ref>
Another interpretation is required for <hi rend="italic">The Elder Brother</hi>
(1637) which claimed to be 'Printed according to the true Copie';
this text derives from 'a transcript of the original MS. corrected
for the press by Massinger'.<ref target="f006.09.29" n="29"><hi rend="super">29</hi></ref>
Another variety of meaning is shown in the title-page of the
Beaumont and Fletcher
folio of 1647, which stated that the plays were 'now published by
the Authours Originall Copies'. Here other evidence shows that in
the majority of cases it was 'the licensed prompt-books from which
performances had been given' that were sent to the printers.
<ref target="f006.09.30" n="30"><hi rend="super">30</hi></ref> It is clear that even if <hi rend="italic">The
Duchess
of Malfi</hi>'s 'perfect and exact Coppy' seems justified in a
general sense, no precise meaning can be given to the words.</p>
<p>Nor can any clear information come from the claim that the text
includes 'diuerse <hi rend="italic">things Printed, that the length of the Play
would</hi> not beare in the Presentment'; passages omitted in
performance could be found in the prompt-book as well as in the
original papers of the author. Omissions were seldom marked so that
the text was undecipherable; often a vertical line in the left
margin appears to have been sufficient.
<ref target="f006.09.31" n="31"><hi rend="super">31</hi></ref></p>



<p>On sig. A2<hi rend="super">v</hi>, following the title-page, there is an
incomplete
list of <hi rend="italic">dramatis person&oelig;</hi> and of the actors who took the
parts mentioned. There are earlier lists of principal actors in
plays by Beaumont and Fletcher and by Jonson, but <hi rend="italic">The Duchess of
Malfi</hi> was the first play from the repertory of the King's Men
to be published with a list assigning parts to individual actors.
Unfortunately there are no manuscript casts extant and "we are left
to speculate as to the origin of the Casts printed in a few late
quartos."<ref target="f006.09.32" n="32"><hi rend="super">32</hi></ref> <hi rend="italic">The Duchess of
Malfi</hi>'s cast can therefore give no clue to the copy beyond the
general inference that the actors were interested in the
publication or were perhaps consulted about it. A similar inference
may be

<pb n="006.130"/>

drawn from the dedication (A3-3<hi rend="super">v</hi>) to George Harding,
Baron
Berkeley of Berkeley Castle. Webster here presents his excuse why,
'(being a stranger to your Lordshippe) I offer this Poem to your
Patronage'. Presumably he selected this unknown patron because of
his family connection with the Lords Hunsdon, previous patrons of
the King's Men.<ref target="f006.09.33" n="33"><hi rend="super">33</hi></ref> The players might
well have been those persons 'of worth, who both in
<hi rend="italic">contemplation,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">practice'</hi> owed George
Harding
service, and who directed Webster to this likely patron.</p>
<p>The general authority of the text and the author's interest in
publication are also attested by the commendatory poems
(A4-4<hi rend="super">v</hi>)
and the note 'The Author disclaimes this Ditty to be his'
(III.iv.11-4; H2).<ref target="f006.09.34" n="34"><hi rend="super">34</hi></ref> We may
therefore sum up the evidence so far considered as implying that
the author and players agreed to publish a worthy text of <hi rend="italic">The
Duchess of Malfi,</hi> a play which had been in their repertory
since 1613-14.<ref target="f006.09.35" n="35"><hi rend="super">35</hi></ref> Cuts had been made

in the text, but they let it be known that the printed play would
aim at a complete text rather than an acting version. Textual,
bibliographical, and typographical evidence must further elucidate
the nature of the copy which was sent to the printers.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly it was not a prompt-book or the author's foul
papers, though it could have been based on either of these: the
entries massed at the beginning of each scene make this much clear,
and show that the copy was intended for readers and not for use in
a theatre. It has been thought that texts with massed entries were
assembled from players' parts by the help of the 'plot', but this
theory has not been substantiated and massed entries are more
probably due to the idiosyncrasy of a scribe.
<ref target="f006.09.36" n="36"><hi rend="super">36</hi></ref> It remains to investigate who made
the
transcript and from what sources.</p>
<p>Evidence on the latter point is likely to be obscured by the
editing of the transcriber. For instance, irregularities in
nomenclature in the speech directions and stage directions can give
clues to the nature of the copy; in this text they are regular and
unambiguous. The abbreviated forms of Cariola and the Cardinal
might cause confusion but this is carefully avoided: when both
characters are on the stage together, or soon after each other,
Cariola is given in full (e.g., I.i.215; B4, and I.i.393 &amp; 400;
C2<hi rend="super">v</hi>). Such care is in contrast to the practice in <hi rend="italic">The
White
Devil</hi> but no inference can be drawn, since the scribe who
prepared the copy or the book-keeper in the theatre might equally
be responsible. There is a similar doubt about

<pb n="006.131"/>

a stage direction at the head of V.iii (M3<hi rend="super">v</hi>):
<hi rend="italic">'Antonio,
Delio, Eccho, (from the Dutchesse Graue.)'</hi> This is most readily
explained as an author's direction, for a prompter would hardly use
these words to remind himself that the actor who played the Duchess
would also speak the Echo; yet, if it could not derive directly
from the prompter, it might be the transcriber's interpretation of
his direction.</p>
<p>Several textual details have been adduced as signs of a
prompt-book origin for the copy, but in each case the facts can
bear another interpretation. For instance, Rupert Brooke drew
attention to I.i.187(B3<hi rend="super">v</hi>); here

<q>Delio usefully questions Antonio about the other chief
characters. Antonio gives a long description of the Cardinal; then
a long description of the Duke, his brother; then, before going on
to the Duchess, he reverts suddenly to the Cardinal, as if he had
not mentioned him, with: 'Last, for his brother there, the
Cardinal. . . .'</q>

Brooke suggested that this might 'point to a combination of two
versions', and from the context he implied that these versions were
due to a revision of the original play.
<ref target="f006.09.37" n="37"><hi rend="super">37</hi></ref> But such irregularities could be
due to
unpolished writing and derive from the author's fould papers rather
than a prompt-book.</p>
<p>Two other possible clues may be as briefly dismissed. One is the
account of a play by an Italian, Orazio Busino, written 7 Feb.
1618; this may refer to <hi rend="italic">The Duchess of Malfi</hi> but if so,
"there must have been a good deal in the performance he saw which
is not in the play as we have it&mdash;even allowing for his
misinterpretation."<ref target="f006.09.38" n="38"><hi rend="super">38</hi></ref></p>
<p>If the identification is allowed, there is nothing to show
whether the play as this contemporary saw it, was the original or
the revision; only if it were the original would the printed text
be likely to derive from the prompt-book. The other clue was a
supposed allusion (I.i.6-23; B1-1<hi rend="super">v</hi>) to the murder, on 24
April
1617, of Concino Concini, Mar&eacute;chal d'Ancre; but now the allusion
cannot be considered proved and it is no longer evidence for a
revised text.<ref target="f006.09.39" n="39"><hi rend="super">39</hi></ref></p>
<p>Professor R. C. Bald saw further evidence of a prompt-book,
pointing out that the

<q>direction at the opening of the play is <hi rend="italic">Antonio, Delio,
Cardinal, Bosola,</hi> but, in spite of the fact that there is no
new scene, there is another massed stage direction after line
8[3]<ref target="f006.09.40" n="40"><hi rend="super">40</hi></ref> which contains the names of
these four characters a second time, . . . . Lines [1-83] are thus,
it would seem, one of those passages which 'the length of the

<pb n="006.132"/>

Play would not beare in the Presentment' . . . . . . In making the
cut in the theatrical prompt-book, the prompter had to make
provision for the entry, along with the others at the new beginning
of the play, of the four characters
<ref target="f006.09.41" n="41"><hi rend="super">41</hi></ref> whose opening speeches were now

omitted; but, in preparing the text for the printer, a massed stage
direction was put at the head of the omitted speeches when they
were restored, although the direction which stood at the beginning
of the play while the cut was in force has been unintelligently
repeated in the massed direction that now comes after line 8[3] in
the quarto text. Such confusion can hardly have arisen from
anything but the state of the prompt-copy'.
<ref target="f006.09.42" n="42"><hi rend="super">42</hi></ref></q></p>
<p>To say that there is 'no new scene' after 1.83 is to contradict
the printed text which marks 'SCENA II' at this point. Certainly
there is no <hi rend="italic">Exeunt</hi> at the close of <hi rend="italic">'Scena
Prima',</hi> but
this proves nothing, for there is no <hi rend="italic">Exit</hi> when Bosola leaves
the stage at the end of II.iii; Antonio and Delio might well make
their exits and re-enter in the Duke's train at the beginning of
'SCENA II'. Something of the same sort is found in <hi rend="italic">The Winter's
Tale,</hi> which also has massed entries. Again I.ii is a 'presence'
scene and it is preceded by a dialogue between two lords, Camillo
and Archidamus. <hi rend="italic">'Exeunt'</hi> is marked at the end of the
preliminary scene, but Camillo is in attendance on the royal
parties in Scene ii. He does not speak until l.210, but editors
agree that he has been present from the beginning. There is no
suggestion here that the first scene was cut in performance.</p>
<p>Professor Bald does, however, reject the evidence of the stage
direction <hi rend="italic">'A Coffin, Cords, and a Bell.'</hi> (IV.ii.164-6;
K1<hi rend="super">v</hi>) which looks at first like a prompter's direction. It
has
the brevity, but is probably

<q>an explanatory note to line 16[4], 'Here is a present from your
Princely brothers', since one would have expected a prompter to
make such a note for properties a little before the entrance of the
executioners, which, though it occurs here, is not indicated by a
stage direction at this point.<ref target="f006.09.43" n="43"><hi rend="super">43</hi></ref></q>

This is supported by another brief note at III.v.37(H3); Bosola has
entered (l.28) with a letter which he hands to the Duchess, and,
before she reads it, the text has the words 'A Letter.'. These are
printed in ordinary type as if beginning a new line of verse,
except that they are inset a little from the margin; the inset
supports Lucas' contention that the words are a stage direction
rather than part of the Duchess' speech.
<ref target="f006.09.44" n="44"><hi rend="super">44</hi></ref> As before, a prompter's note
would have
been placed before Bosola's entry; he would want to be sure that
the actor <hi rend="italic">entered</hi> with the letter.</p>
<p>Textual errors cannot give any clear indication of the copy
used; the

<pb n="006.133"/>

only possibility is the omission of a speech by Bosola (II.iii.54;
E2) which might be due to a cut being marked in the acting version
in a way that rendered the passage undecipherable. But the error
could also derive from foul papers or the accidental omission of
the passage by a scribe or compositor.</p>
<p>One further peculiarity should be mentioned though it too is
ambiguous. In the list of actors, N. Towley is given as playing the
part of Forobosco, but in the play this character occurs only when
he is spoken of as keeping 'the key o'th'Parke-gate' (II.ii.31-3;
D4-4<hi rend="super">v</hi>): he is not mentioned in the stage directions nor has
he
any lines to say; he need never appear on the stage. Possibly a
passage which was in an acting version of <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> 1620
<ref target="f006.09.45" n="45"><hi rend="super">45</hi></ref> is missing from the printed text;
this
passage might have been in Webster's text as he sent it to the
players, or it might have been added afterwards. If it was
original, the 'diuerse <hi rend="italic">things Printed, that the length of the
Play would</hi> not beare in the Presentment' cannot be inclusive of
all such omissions. If it was a new addition, the reference to
Forobosco which remains in the text must be so too. In either case,
the ultimate source of the copy was probably the prompt-book, which
would have
recorded these changes.</p>
<p>There is, however, an alternative explanation. In contrast to
the care taken with the nomenclature in speech directions and stage
directions, there are several irregularities among the <hi rend="italic">dramatis
person&oelig;</hi> (A2<hi rend="super">v</hi>); '<hi rend="italic">The Marquesse
of</hi> Pescara' is
found
rather than 'Pescara' as elsewhere, and, more significant,
'<hi rend="italic">The</hi> Cardinals M<hi rend="super">is</hi>.' instead of 'Julia'.
Rodorigo,
Grisolan, Castruchio, and the Old Lady are omitted. These
irregularities would not be remarkable were it not for the careful
work of the scribe; in view of this, it is possible that the
<hi rend="italic">dramatis person&oelig;</hi> and actor list were compiled from
memory
by someone other than the scribe, perhaps the author. Perhaps
Webster originally intended Forobosco to play some part in the
action of the play&mdash;the 'ghost' characters in <hi rend="italic">The White
Devil</hi> suggest similar changes of intention&mdash;and then, when
compiling the <hi rend="italic">dramatis person&oelig;,</hi> he remembered the idea
and the name. The compositor, through
accident or misreading, could have placed 'N. Towley' opposite
Forobosco instead of Malateste who is allotted to no actor. It is
even possible that Webster thought Towley played the part and was
therefore unable to remember who had played Malateste. In any case,
the Forobosco irregularity cannot definitely indicate a prompt-book
origin for the copy.</p>
<p>In summing up, it must be said that the copy had been so edited
that there is no clear evidence of its origin, but whatever its
ultimate source, the quality of the text reinforces the belief that
the quarto was fully authoritative.

<pb n="006.134"/>

In trying to discover who made the transcript which served as copy,
the evidence is more informative.</p>
<p>Several factors suggest that the scribe was Ralph Crane: he
worked for the King's Men from before 1621,
<ref target="f006.09.46" n="46"><hi rend="super">46</hi></ref> he was certainly the scribe of
<hi rend="italic">A
Game at Chess</hi> (Bodleian, Mal. MS.25), the only extant
manuscript play which completely reproduces the massed entries of
<hi rend="italic">The Duchess of Malfi,</hi> and, as an example of more minute
evidence, the peculiar direction 'A Letter' which has already been
noticed above, is reproduced in Crane's transcript of Middleton's
<hi rend="italic">The Witch</hi> (M.S.R., 1.646). Crane's habits of spelling and
punctuation have been fairly often studied,
<ref target="f006.09.47" n="47"><hi rend="super">47</hi></ref> and many of them are found in the

printed text of Webster's play.</p>
<p>There are difficulties in assessing evidence for this. In the
first place, compositors often changed the accidentals of their
copy. However, this difficulty is not insurmountable; none of the
four plays which were also printed for the first time by Nicholas
Okes between 1617 and 1627 can provide detailed similarities to
Crane's characteristics which are in any way comparable with those
found in <hi rend="italic">The Duchess of Malfi</hi>. For example, there are some
210 pairs of brackets in Webster's play, but in <hi rend="italic">The Maid's
Tragedy</hi> (1619) there are 14, in <hi rend="italic">Philaster</hi> (1620) 1, in
<hi rend="italic">Thierry and Theodoret</hi> (1621) 31 and in <hi rend="italic">Othello</hi>

(1622)
7.<ref target="f006.09.48" n="48"><hi rend="super">48</hi></ref> Secondly, Crane's manuscripts
show that he was not constant in all his habits; for instance, he
temporarily showed a greater pedantry when he was transcribing the
two manuscripts of <hi rend="italic">A Game at Chess</hi>.
<ref target="f006.09.49" n="49"><hi rend="super">49</hi></ref> Thirdly, there is no known
example of
Webster's handwriting; it is
just conceivable that he had similar characteristics to Crane's. As
the only available check on this, a comparison will be made with
the printed text of <hi rend="italic">The White Devil</hi> which, as we have
suggested, was possibly based on an autograph copy.</p>
<p>All Crane's manuscripts show a fondness for parentheses and
colons, and in his transcripts of <hi rend="italic">A Game at Chess</hi> he used
'emphasis capitals more frequently and more consistently' than the
autograph copy.<ref target="f006.09.50" n="50"><hi rend="super">50</hi></ref> These
characteristics

<pb n="006.135"/>

are represented in <hi rend="italic">The Duchess of Malfi;</hi> compared with
<hi rend="italic">The White Devil,</hi> which has approximately the same number
of
lines,<ref target="f006.09.51" n="51"><hi rend="super">51</hi></ref> capitals, brackets, and
colons are all more frequent. Not counting those used at the
beginning of lines and sentences, and for proper names, titles, and
words of address, there are about 900 capitals in <hi rend="italic">The
Duchess</hi> and about 550 in <hi rend="italic">The White Devil.</hi>
<ref target="f006.09.52" n="52"><hi rend="super">52</hi></ref> For colons and semi-colons the
proportion is 984 to 476, and for brackets, 210 to 5. Hyphens are
used excessively in Crane's manuscript of <hi rend="italic">The Witch</hi> and
although this was not a constant habit in Crane, nor one peculiar
to him, it may be significant that there are 258 hyphens in <hi rend="italic">The
Duchess</hi> and only 172 in the earlier play. Some usages are
restricted to <hi rend="italic">The Duchess:</hi> for instance, 'pray-thee' (four
times; III.ii.62; F4, IV.i.23; I1, IV.ii.207; K2, and V.ii.5; L2),
'cas'de-vp' (twice; II. iii.84; E2,
misprinted 'caside-vp', and III.ii.162; G1), and 'to-much' (I.i.35;
B1<hi rend="super">v</hi>), 'Tilt-often' (I.i.122; B3), and 'throttle-her'
(IV.ii.262;
K3).</p>





<p>Crane's use of the apostrophe has many peculiarities, some of
which are reproduced in <hi rend="italic">The Duchess of Malfi</hi>. The
abbreviation 'neu'r' is found eight times and 'you'll'd', for <hi rend="italic">you
would,</hi> is found once together with 'I'll'd' (five times),
'they'll'd' (once), and the variants, 'I'ld', 'I'l'd', and 'Youl'd'
(once each). 'Neu'r' is not found in <hi rend="italic">The White Devil</hi> and the
closest to 'you'll'd' etc. is 'you'ld', 'Yee'ld', and 'You'd' (once
each).<ref target="f006.09.53" n="53"><hi rend="super">53</hi></ref> Occasionally Crane used the
form '-'de' for the past tense ending, as in 'tyr'de' (<hi rend="italic">Demetrius
and Enanthe,</hi> l.183), or 'liu'de' (<hi rend="italic">The Witch,</hi> l.262);
this form occurs seven or eight times in <hi rend="italic">The Duchess of
Malfi,</hi><ref target="f006.09.54" n="54"><hi rend="super">54</hi></ref> but not once in
<hi rend="italic">The
White Devil</hi>. The 'Jonsonian' elision, which is so marked in
<hi rend="italic">The Witch,</hi> is only found once in <hi rend="italic">The Duchess of
Malfi</hi>
where the metre seems to require the elision of 'here'it' (II.v.20;
E4). This
provides no distinction between the two plays, for <hi rend="italic">The White
Devil</hi> also has 'You'are' (V.i.41;

<pb n="006.136"/>

I1). One significant clue is in Crane's habit of adding the loop to
an 'l' after the word in which it occurs has been completed.
<ref target="f006.09.55" n="55"><hi rend="super">55</hi></ref> When carelessly made it may
easily be
mistaken for an apostrophe, and this could well be responsible for
the curious form 'Rall'y' in <hi rend="italic">The Duchess</hi> (V.v.65;
N2<hi rend="super">v</hi>).</p>
<p>Some of Crane's characteristic spellings are found in <hi rend="italic">The
Duchess:</hi> 'noyce' (seven times), 'Whether' for <hi rend="italic">whither</hi>

(three times), and 'sencible', 'sencibly, 'doong',
<hi rend="italic">'beutifie',</hi> and 'hether' (once each). His use of 'o' for
<hi rend="italic">u</hi> as in 'droms', 'nomber', etc. may be seen in 'somme', and
'dombe'.<ref target="f006.09.56" n="56"><hi rend="super">56</hi></ref> None of these spellings
is found in <hi rend="italic">The White Devil,</hi> but the following Crane
spellings, though found in <hi rend="italic">The Duchess,</hi> can be paralleled in
the earlier play: 'falce', 'Cursses', and 'wincke', 'rancke',
'Incke', 'starcke', etc.<ref target="f006.09.57" n="57"><hi rend="super">57</hi></ref></p>
<p>This survey shows that many, but not all, of Crane's
characteristics are found in <hi rend="italic">The Duchess of Malfi</hi>. Normal
spellings are found side by side with special ones, but, if the
copy were in Crane's hand, this is what we would expect to
find&mdash;especially as it is special forms of common words which are
most notably lacking. Compositors might be expected to regularize
'theis', 'nobely', 'thinck', etc. The evidence for the copy being
in Crane's hand is sufficient to amount to probability. To
summarize, (1) he was working for the King's Men near the time of
publication, (2) the only extant manuscript play with massed
entries is in his hand, (3) a peculiar stage direction is
paralleled in a Crane transcript, (4) the play has a large number
of capitals, brackets, colons, and hyphens and this reflects
Crane's usage, (5) characteristic uses of hyphens and apostrophes,
and several characteristic spellings are found, (6) in these
respects <hi rend="italic">The Duchess</hi> differs from <hi rend="italic">The White
Devil,</hi> which was possibly in Webster's autograph, and none of
the four plays printed for the first time by Okes between 1617 and
1627 can compare in all these details, and finally (7) the form
'Rall'y' may be a misreading due to Crane's manner of writing an
'l'.</p>

<pb n="006.137"/>

<p>We may conclude that the copy for <hi rend="italic">The Duchess of
Malfi</hi>
was a transcript, probably in the hand of Ralph Crane, and that the
text had been so prepared that no clear sign of foul papers or
prompt-book has survived. It is also probable that the author was
responsible for the publication, which was undertaken with the
consent of the players.</p>
<p>The evidence for the copy of <hi rend="italic">The Devil's Law Case,</hi>
printed by A[ugustine] M[athewes] and dated 1623, is slight and
inconclusive. The publication was undertaken with the author's help
as is shown by his dedication (A2) and epistle (A2<hi rend="super">v</hi>) and
the
fact that the 'vnbeg'd Commendatory Verses' of his friends were
offered for the edition ('To the Iuditious Reader'; A2<hi rend="super">v</hi>).
According to the title-page, the text was '<hi rend="italic">The true and perfect
Copie from the Originall</hi>. As it was approouedly well Acted by
her Maiesties Seruants.' All this can only imply that the
publication was authoritative, and the careful text bears this out;
apart from some false Latin and French, there are no apparent
errors in the text which need imply a fault in the copy itself.</p>
<p>Rupert Brooke thought there was one error that implied a
promptbook origin:

<q>on three separate occasions in III.3, [144, -7, &amp; 239;
F3<hi rend="super">v</hi>
&amp; 4<hi rend="super">v</hi>] the 1623 edition has "Surgeon" where it ought
to be
"Surgeons," for there were two surgeons in the case. It would have
lessened the dramatic effect but not hurt the plot to reduce these
two to one, and it is just the kind of change that might have been
made in order to use fewer actors. . . .
<ref target="f006.09.58" n="58"><hi rend="super">58</hi></ref></q>

But one textual correction must be considered in conjunction with
the whole play. If two surgeons were reduced to one in performance,
the dialogue in III.ii would have to be entirely recast, much of it
as soliloquy, and stage directions throughout the play would have
to be changed. Before one deduced that the copy was a prompt-book,
it would have to be shown how such a far reaching change left so
few marks in the text, and none in the stage directions. A more
satisfactory explanation would be that the singulars are survivals
from foul papers; the need for two surgeons may not have been
apparent until the play was partly written, and a few casual
allusions might escape Webster's attention in the subsequent
rewriting. However the singulars may not be copy errors; the third
occurrence is possibly a misprint for <hi rend="italic">Surgeon</hi> (cf. 'they',
l.241), and, for the others, the element of gullery allows some
latitude in the false description of Contarino's supposed death. In
soliloquy
between these passages, Romelio refers precisely to 'my two
Surgeons' (l.225; F4<hi rend="super">v</hi>). There is clearly no firm evidence
for
the copy, either way.</p>


<pb n="006.138"/>

<p>One entry looks like the kind of anticipated direction that
would derive from a prompt-book. Unlike the premature entries of
<hi rend="italic">The White Devil,</hi> the entry of <hi rend="italic">'Contarino in a
bed'</hi>
(III.ii.69; E4) seems to be marked earlier than dramatic propriety
demands. If the direction were followed, Contarino would appear
before the bargain was settled between Romelio and the surgeons.
However there are other directions which are misplaced in the play:

<list>
<item>1. <hi rend="italic">'Enter Contarino.'</hi> (I.ii.236;C1)&mdash;a line too

late.</item>

<item>2. <hi rend="italic">'Enter Rom. Julio, Ariosto, Baptista'</hi>
(II.i.95-6;C3<hi rend="super">v</hi>)&mdash;a line too late.</item>

<item>3. <hi rend="italic">'Enter Contarino,</hi> . . .' (IV.ii.4-5; H1)&mdash;2
lines
too early.</item>

<item>4. <hi rend="italic">'Con. speaks aside.'</hi> (V.ii.15-6; K3)&mdash;a
line too
late.</item>

<item>5. <hi rend="italic">'to his mother'</hi> (V.iv.151-2; L2)&mdash;4 lines
too
early.</item>
</list>

Four of these misplacements could hardly derive from a prompt-book
(1, 2, 4, and 5) and the simplest explanation which covers all
these and Contarino's entry in III.ii, is that either the copy did
not indicate the correct positions carefully or else the compositor
was not accurate in reproducing them. In no. 5 there is plenty of
room to the right of the text at the appropriate place, so the
direction was not displaced to make the type setting easier.</p>
<p>A direction in V.ii has some interest; it reads:

<q><hi rend="italic">Enter Ercole with a letter, and Contarino comming in Friers
habits, as hauing bin at the Bathanites, a Ceremony vsed afore
these Combates</hi>. (V.ii.12; K3).</q>

R. B. McKerrow noted that a

<q>mark of genuine prompter's copies is the mention, at the time of
the entry of a character, of properties which he will require later
in the scene, but either must not or need not exhibit to the
audience at the time of entry.
<ref target="f006.09.59" n="59"><hi rend="super">59</hi></ref></q>

At first sight, <hi rend="italic">'Enter Ercole with a letter,</hi> . . .' seems to
conform to this type, for the letter is not mentioned in dialogue
until 17 lines later. But this is not certain evidence. Ercole has
to be on the stage while Contarino is speaking an aside of 4&frac12;
lines, and, although at line 30 Ercole speaks of having just
received the letter, he already knows its contents. It may be that
Ercole opens and reads the letter as soon as he appears on the
stage. There is a parallel to this in <hi rend="italic">The Duchess of Malfi,</hi>
where the Cardinal enters <hi rend="italic">'with a Booke'</hi> (V.v. Entry; N2)
and it is clear from the text that he is reading it. If this
business is correct for <hi rend="italic">The Devil's Law Case,</hi> the direction
no longer conforms to McKerrow's description. Two other factors
support this. First, the letter needed earlier in the play
(I.i.223; B2) is not mentioned in any direction. Secondly, the
reference to the Bathanites

<pb n="006.139"/>

suggests that the rest of the direction is purely literary in
origin; if so the first part is likely to be as well, for it all
reads as one. In passing, it may be noticed that other directions
are literary in tone: the reference to Romelio as Leonora's son
(V.iv. 128; L1<hi rend="super">v</hi>), <hi rend="italic">'Enter Romelio very
melancholly,</hi> . . .'
(V.iv.43; K4<hi rend="super">v</hi>), and <hi rend="italic">'Enter Contilupo a spruce
Lawyer.'</hi>
(IV. i.83; G4<hi rend="super">v</hi>).</p>
<p>One more direction needs special attention;

<q><hi rend="italic">A Table set forth with two Tapers, a Deaths head, a Booke,
Iolenta in mourning, Romelio sits by her</hi>. (III.iii.Entry;
F1<hi rend="super">v</hi>)</q>

This corresponds to a general feature of prompt-books: "If an
author mentions properties it is as a rule only incidentally; the
prompter is precise and peremptory."
<ref target="f006.09.60" n="60"><hi rend="super">60</hi></ref> However, further factors must be
taken
into account before the identification is made: (1) the precise
injunction is only part of a descriptive direction in a form not
specifically characteristic of prompt-books, (2) in <hi rend="italic">The White
Devil</hi> Webster has given specific instructions regarding
properties in a form unlike that of a prompter (I.ii.193-5;
B4<hi rend="super">v</hi>), so that he was obviously thoughtful about such
matters,
and, (3) the properties are not essential to the action. The
occasion for the tapers, death's head, and book is clear from
Romelio's first words, 'Why do you grieue thus?'; they are all
tokens of Jolenta's grief which is not fully explicit in dialogue,
and they have only this representational purpose. Concern for such
a matter seems more characteristic of an author than a
prompter, and so is the carelessness which did not mention the
stools on which Jolenta and Romelio were to sit. If the direction
were a prompter's, one would expect the list of properties to be
complete.</p>
<p>Having discussed, and seen reason to dismiss, some evidence for
a prompt-book copy,<ref target="f006.09.61" n="61"><hi rend="super">61</hi></ref> we may
examine
a few details of contrary evidence. First is a variation in a
character name; in the list of <hi rend="italic">dramatis personae</hi>
(A1<hi rend="super">v</hi>)
and in her first entry and speech directions (I.ii.190; B4<hi rend="super">v</hi>
<hi rend="italic">et seq.</hi>), Winifred appears as <hi rend="italic">'A wayting
Woman',</hi>
and
only in III.iii. does she become <hi rend="italic">'Winifrid'</hi> (l.378;
G2<hi rend="super">v</hi>)
whereafter the earlier forms do not occur. These are very slight
variations compared with those in <hi rend="italic">The White Devil,</hi> and there

is no fluctuation as between <hi rend="italic">'Francisco'</hi> and
<hi rend="italic">'Florence';</hi> a theory of a foul-paper copy cannot be
constructed on this evidence alone.</p>
<p>The next point concerns entries; an entry for the Capuchin and
Ercole is omitted altogether (III.iii.309; G1<hi rend="super">v</hi>) and
Sanitonella
is omitted from the list of characters entering for the final
scene. Either of these could be mere

<pb n="006.140"/>

carelessness in the compositor, but also they may be due to the
copy; if the latter, the copy could hardly be the prompt-book which
should be complete in such matters.</p>
<p>The 'ghost' character, Baptista, is one more shred of evidence
pointing in the same direction. Like Forobosco in <hi rend="italic">The Duchess of
Malfi,</hi> his name occurs in dialogue (I.i.19; A3), but, like the
'ghost' characters in <hi rend="italic">The White Devil,</hi> it is also found in
the stage directions (II.i.96; C3<hi rend="super">v</hi>, and II.ii.35;
D3<hi rend="super">v</hi>). In
<hi rend="italic">The White Devil</hi> these character names were taken as
evidence
against the copy coming from the theatre where the prompter would
probably eradicate such needless complications; on slighter
grounds, the same may hold here.</p>
<p>This seems to be the limit of evidence bearing on the nature of
the copy of <hi rend="italic">The Devil's Law Case;</hi> in view of the literary
directions, the one variation in nomenclature, the omitted entries
and the 'ghost' character, we may say that if the copy had any
distinctive merits, they were those of a literary rather than a
theatrical manuscript. But this must be a hesitant answer.</p>

<p>The long Parliament was prompt in punishment of its members who
remained loyal to Charles I. One member from Surrey, Sir Thomas
Bludder, was particularly obnoxious to the Puritans, for he had
joined the King at Oxford and had sat in the Royal Parliament. In
the spring of 1643 he was "disabled," and on 27 May "An Inventary
of Goods &amp; Chattell of S<hi rend="super">r</hi> Thomas Bludder delinquent
sequestred
by the Committee appoynted by ordnaunce of Parliment"
<ref target="f006.10.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref> was drawn up, presumably in
preparation
for confiscation or evaluation as payment of a heavy fine.
Unfortunate as may be its implications of the knight's material
misfortune, the inventory is an interesting and perhaps significant
record of the household and intellectual life of the owner of the
property.</p>
<p>It begins with a listing of the furnishings of the rooms of what
was certainly a moderately-large gentleman's house. Suits of armor,
pistols, rapiers, bedstead curtains and matching window draperies,
cradles, tapestries, hangings and linens, as well as wooden
furniture, are among them. The contents were listed by rooms, the
best furnished of which were "the Yellow Chamber," the storeroom
above it, "Mr. Marshall's Chamber," "the close stoole roome," "The
Mans Chamber," "Mr John Bill's Chamber," "the Blew Chamber," "the
dark Chamber," "the Maids Chamber," "the Square Chamber," the
dining room, the scullery, the pantry, the larder, the buttery, the
parlor, the "scaled Garret," "the Matted Chamber," Sir Thomas'
"studye," and the storehouse. In the dining room alone there hung
twenty-four pictures of varying size. The study contained, among
other things, one pair of embroidered slippers and one little
cellar with four glasses for strong waters, natural concomitants of
its
many books.</p>

<pb n="006.142"/>

<p>A great proportion of the inventory is taken with a listing of
these books and others in the house. At first glance one may feel
that here is a representative Stuart library assembled by a
gentleman of some means, and such it may be. More than a glance,
however, will make one question it as typical, for there are
certain peculiarities among the titles themselves and in their
places of deposit, and the inscriptions noted as present in at
least one volume are indicatory that some of the books were not
present as a result of Bludder's tastes in reading material. Some
books were obviously once owned by John Bill, King's Printer, whose
son John Junior now resided in the house. Others belonged to a Mr.
Marshall, who also resided in the house and kept a more-or-less
homogeneous group of volumes in his own room. And one chest full,
almost all Spanish titles, reposed in a chest in an upper hallway
between the rooms of Marshall and Bill.</p>
<p>The individual titles and the groupings take on more
significance if one learns something about the persons who
possessed the volumes, both as individuals and in their relation to
each other. Bludder himself is in many respects the typical Stuart
courtier. Gentleman of the Privy Chamber,
<ref target="f006.10.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref> many times member of Parliament,
<ref target="f006.10.03" n="3"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref> farmer of sea-coals,
<ref target="f006.10.04" n="4"><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref> victualler of the Navy,
<ref target="f006.10.05" n="5"><hi rend="super">5</hi></ref> Surveyor of Ordnance,
<ref target="f006.10.06" n="6"><hi rend="super">6</hi></ref> collector of rent-fines under grant
from the King,<ref target="f006.10.07" n="7"><hi rend="super">7</hi></ref> he should have been

prosperous. Yet we have evidence that he was more than once in the
1630's on the verge of bankruptcy or of imprisonment by his
creditors, for the King in 1632 granted him protection for one more
year with the stipulation that he was not again to request it.
<ref target="f006.10.08" n="8"><hi rend="super">8</hi></ref> He was apparently a personal
friend of
the
poet and courtier George Sandys, who presented to him a copy of the
elaborate 1632 edition of Ovid's <hi rend="italic">Metamorphosis,</hi>
<ref target="f006.10.09" n="9"><hi rend="super">9</hi></ref> soon after the book's publication.
And
he was again representative of the courtier's accomplishments in
his own

<pb n="006.143"/>

lines "Upon ye death of ye Lady An: Rich,"
<ref target="f006.10.10" n="10"><hi rend="super">10</hi></ref> which were included in a
collection of
tributes to the lady, most of the poems being from the hands of
more talented gentlemen such as Sidney Godolphin, Edmund Waller,
and Henry King.</p>





<p>Sir Thomas Bludder was the son of another Sir Thomas
<ref target="f006.10.11" n="11"><hi rend="super">11</hi></ref> of Flanchford near Reigate in
Surrey,
the father, a London merchant of prominence, having himself been
first commissioner of the victualling office under James I.
<ref target="f006.10.12" n="12"><hi rend="super">12</hi></ref> Since the son became a member
of the
Inner Temple in 1615,<ref target="f006.10.13" n="13"><hi rend="super">13</hi></ref> he was
probably born in the last decade of the preceding century. This
younger Sir Thomas was Knighted at Whitehall in 1618
<ref target="f006.10.14" n="14"><hi rend="super">14</hi></ref> a few months before his father's
death,<ref target="f006.10.15" n="15"><hi rend="super">15</hi></ref> and evidently succeeded his
parent in several royal appointments. Apparently he married three
times, for there are references to Elizabeth, daughter of Robert
Brett, as his third wife,<ref target="f006.10.16" n="16"><hi rend="super">16</hi></ref> who
erected a monument to his memory soon after his death in 1655.</p>


<p>Some time after 1630 and before 1636/7, Bludder married Jane
Bill (born Franklin), widow of John Bill, the King's Printer, for
in the latter year Bludder's wife Jane's and "infant John Bill's"
share in the office of King's Printer was confirmed to them.
<ref target="f006.10.17" n="17"><hi rend="super">17</hi></ref> She was probably Sir Thomas'
second
wife,<ref target="f006.10.18" n="18"><hi rend="super">18</hi></ref> and probably was living at
the time this inventory was made.</p>



<pb n="006.144"/>

<p>Little more is known of Bludder up to 1643. Whatever punishment
came as a result of his loyalty to the King then or later did not
deter him from further activity, for in a report of August 1649 by
the Council of State to the Lord General, one learns that he had
been under constant surveillance during at least a year preceding.
He was the ringleader of a group in Surrey which had the year
before fomented a rebellion, and was now stirring up sedition at
Epsom under the pretence of taking the waters there. And, states
the Council, definite proof of his subversive activity lies in the
fact that he and his well-armed friends at the springs "do not
drink the water."<ref target="f006.10.19" n="19"><hi rend="super">19</hi></ref> The year before,
probably at the end of the rebellion, he had been imprisoned in
Peterhouse, and on 30 September 1648 had with his servant been
transferred, perhaps on some sort of parole, to the custody of a
gentleman of Southwark.<ref target="f006.10.20" n="20"><hi rend="super">20</hi></ref> In 1651
he
lived in a
section of Southwark called the Mint.
<ref target="f006.10.21" n="21"><hi rend="super">21</hi></ref> And on 29 September 1655, he
died,
having made his will on the 17 of July preceding.
<ref target="f006.10.22" n="22"><hi rend="super">22</hi></ref></p>
<p>Residing in the same house with Sir Thomas was, as we have seen,
Mr. John Bill. This was John Bill, Junior, Bludder's stepson, and
the son of John Bill (1576-1630), King's Printer.
<ref target="f006.10.23" n="23"><hi rend="super">23</hi></ref> As the family Bible listed below
indicates, young Bill was still a minor when the inventory was
begun, but attained his majority before it was completed. Evidently
Bludder's marriage to Jane Bill, widow, some time after her
husband's death in 1630 and before 1636,
<ref target="f006.10.24" n="24"><hi rend="super">24</hi></ref> brought to his household many of
the
books listed below. A brief survey of the career of the elder John
Bill offers some explanation of the presence of certain types of
books in this library.</p>
<p>Born in 1576,<ref target="f006.10.25" n="25"><hi rend="super">25</hi></ref> John Bill had
been apprenticed to John Norton, printer, in 1592 and had taken out
his freedom in 1601. Probably between 1596 and 1602 or 1603, he
traveled abroad gathering books for Sir Thomas

<pb n="006.145"/>

Bodley,<ref target="f006.10.26" n="26"><hi rend="super">26</hi></ref> and we know that he
regularly visited the Frankfurt book fair.
<ref target="f006.10.27" n="27"><hi rend="super">27</hi></ref> Bill was an intimate friend of John
and
Bonham Norton, and with them helped to finance the printing of the
King James Version of the Bible, in return becoming shareholder in
the King's Printing House. Thus from 1617 to 1630 Bill was one of
the King's Printers. He died on 9 May 1630, leaving the greater
portion of a considerable estate to his wife Jane, daughter of
Henry Franklin.<ref target="f006.10.28" n="28"><hi rend="super">28</hi></ref> He bequeathed to
her, for example, stock in the Company of Stationers worth &pound;320,
and an annuity of &pound;300 to be derived from the profits from his
share in the King's Printing Office.</p>
<p>Another member of the Bludder household, a Mr. Marshall, appears
to have possessed an independent library. Since the great majority
of the books in his chamber are concerned with the law, it seems
not unnatural to suggest that the gentleman was a barrister. It is
impossible to identify him positively, for many Marshalls were
admitted to the inns of court<ref target="f006.10.29" n="29"><hi rend="super">29</hi></ref>
during the forty years before the sequestration of Bludder's
property. The most likely identification seems to be with John
Marshall, aged 28 in 1623, the son of John Marshall of Southwark,
Surrey,<ref target="f006.10.30" n="30"><hi rend="super">30</hi></ref> and admitted a member of
Gray's Inn on 29 January 1626/7.<ref target="f006.10.31" n="31"><hi rend="super">31</hi></ref>
Perhaps it is this John Marshall who was a member of two
commissions appointed by the King in 1638
<ref target="f006.10.32" n="32"><hi rend="super">32</hi></ref> to enquire into the unauthorized
building of cottages in 1635-8 and into the breach of laws against
excessive usury. He may even be the Mr. Marshall
who appeared as counsel before the Court of High Commission in
1635.<ref target="f006.10.33" n="33"><hi rend="super">33</hi></ref></p>

<p>Such is the somewhat scanty information concerning the owner or
owners of these books listed below. The inventory is signed by Ed.

<pb n="006.146"/>

Edmunds, Peter Wealth, and Francis Burrows, evidently one or more
of them a Welshman. And this brings us to the questions of how and
by whom the list was composed, for it is obvious that the persons
setting down the titles knew little Latin and less Spanish, and
that the Welsh background of at least one of those making the
inventory affected the spellings. Though it may be that the list
was made by one or more men glancing at the titles and setting them
down, the absolute illogicality of spelling and of the re-grouping
of syllables into incomprehensible new "words" make this method
seem unlikely. We would suggest that one man read off the titles to
another who set them down, one or both these men Welsh in origin,
and both little or not at all versed in Latin&mdash;beyond the ability
to recognize that it was Latin&mdash;and certainly knowing nothing of
Spanish.</p>
<p>Probably most of the volumes were collected much earlier than
1643, and quite obviously all of them were not brought together as
the working or recreational library of Sir Thomas Bludder. Though
the nucleus of the major portion may have been gathered by Sir
Thomas in his youth or even by his father, the collection had been
steadily added to with current titles up to the time the inventory
was taken. In other words, the indications are that Bludder was a
gentleman who collected books throughout his life, or at least up
to this point in it.</p>
<p>The nature of the "collection" deserves comment. Mr. Marshall's
law books were probably the working library of an active or retired
barrister. The presence of so many Spanish books is somewhat
unusual, and the scrambled and confused listing of them, indicates,
as we have noticed, the utter unfamiliarity of the recorders with
the language. That these books were placed in a trunk in a hallway
would indicate that they had not been as much in use as other
books. The presence of these and other foreign titles in a Stuart
library, in a period when travel on the continent was a usual part
of a gentleman's education, need not evoke too much comment. But
the fact that the elder John Bill had journeyed abroad regularly in
search of books may account for the large number of them. For their
presence is one reason for supposing that Bludder's library
contained either all or a portion of Bill's personal library, or
even more likely, the remainders of his bookseller's stock, or
both. And the
presence of so many unbound and loose sheets, especially of folios,
almost unquestionably confirms the supposition that some of Bill's
stock reposed in the house of Jane Bill Bludder. Again, the large
Biblical element in the library is natural for the period, but one
also remembers that John Bill had participated in the publishing of
the King James Version. Actually there is evidence that as recently
as 1641, Sir Thomas Bludder, acting in one of his official
capacities, had been implicated in the seizure of a number of
Bibles

<pb n="006.147"/>

imported from Holland.<ref target="f006.10.34" n="34"><hi rend="super">34</hi></ref> The nature
of the large proportion of belletristic and classical works among
the "Boukes that were in the litle house in the yard of John Bills"
may indicate the tastes of the younger Bill, or perhaps, though
less likely, may represent a repository of unused items from the
elder Bill's stock or library.</p>
<p>Thus we may call this an assemblage of libraries of Cavalier
gentlemen rather than a Cavalier gentleman's library, for here are
represented the tastes of Bludder and Marshall and perhaps young
Bill, and something of the stock in trade of the elder Bill,
printer to the King and an active bookseller who supplied the needs
of many of the nobles and notables of the Stuart period.

<item>68] The booke of English Poetts
[These three items, which should perhaps be considered as a unit,
and which look so deceptively simple, constitute as much of a
puzzle as anything else in the list. Does the form of entry, for
instance, imply that Nos. 67 and 68 are bound together ? And if so,
is the same true of Nos. 66 and 67 ? They would be so found in one
volume in the Lownes folio of 1613 (-1611). No edition of <hi rend="italic">The
Shepheardes Calender</hi> is known which also contains a "booke of
English Poetts"; and the title of No. 68&mdash;if it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a
title&mdash;is unrecorded in the <hi rend="italic">STC</hi>. What may be
intended, of
course, is some separate collected work such as Robert Allott's
<hi rend="italic">Englands Parnassus; or the Choysest Flowers of our Modern
Poets,</hi> 1600; <hi rend="italic">STC</hi> 378-380. But this particular
juxtaposition of entries tempts speculation in another direction.
Are we here dealing with a printed form, unrecorded and now lost,
of Spenser's own work, <hi rend="italic">The English Poet,</hi> mentioned by
E.K.
in <hi rend="italic">The Shepheardes
Calender</hi> ? Or could the elder John Bill somehow have come into
possession of the poet's original MS of this lost work and have had
it bound, appropriately, with a copy of <hi rend="italic">The Shepheardes
Calender</hi>? How gladly could we spare the rest of the list had
our delinquent recorders been only less delinquent here !
[<hi rend="super">a</hi>]
All things considered, however, it seems best to take these three
items as one&mdash;a blundering misreading of the 1611-(1613) Lownes

to one small volume divided into eight "books", as would be the

the
Seventeenth Century</name>

<p>To turn the pages of Wing and to let one's eyes wander up and
down its double columns sets in motion trains of thought that are
related to one's own particular interests. Here, among the 90,000
titles, are buried the publications of the bookseller one happens
to be working on; here, if one can only pick them up in the right
order, are some missing pieces in the jig-saw of book-trade
practice.</p>
<p>I found, during a recent use of Wing, that my eyes were
repeatedly caught by the italics of certain imprints&mdash;of the group
of booksellers, for instance, with shares in the big Law books; and
then I found that <hi rend="italic">P. Brooksby, J. Deacon, J. Blare and J.
Back</hi> were names that appeared over and over again as issuers of
broadsides, and then that there was an even more formidable group
of ballad proprietors, <hi rend="italic">F. Coles, T. Vere, J. Wright, J. Clarke,
W. Thackeray and T. Passinger</hi>. When I looked more closely I
discovered that these two groups, with one or two individuals like
Grove and Gilbertson, dominated the ballad trade in the latter half
of the seventeenth century and, moreover, that the second group
(with which this article is mainly concerned) had a shifting
pattern in which now one, now two or three or four or all six of
the names properly&mdash;and predictably&mdash;played their
parts.</p>
<p>It was rather like working out one of those competitions which
the London <hi rend="italic">New Statesman</hi> used to publish twenty years ago;

but instead of the red-headed non-smoker whose wife bid "three
hearts" against her uncle the admiral, I had the names of
booksellers, which might be those of fathers or sons or wives, and
odd pieces of information like the date of a will; and instead of
having to find the order in which eight people sat at two bridge
tables, I set myself to discover the sequence of imprints&mdash;perhaps
a dozen and a half variations&mdash;made from ten surnames, and to find
therefrom a means of dating rather more closely the (almost always)
undated ballads printed for the members of the group.</p>

<pb n="006.162"/>

<p>The personalities are Francis Coles and his wife Mary, Thomas
Vere, John Wright, his wife Mary and their son John, William
Gilbertson, John Clarke, Thomas Passinger and his nephew Thomas,
William Thackeray, John Millet and his wife Elizabeth, Alexander
Milbourn and William Onley. The results of the competition I give
straight away, and I suggest that any broadside with one of the
following imprints must have been printed (but not of course
<hi rend="italic">first</hi> printed) during the years shewn in my list against the
imprint.</p>

</list>

<p>Before giving my reasons for these assertions I want to make a
number of points and to rehearse a piece of earlier history.</p>

<list>
<item>(1) I am not concerned either with the authorship of a ballad
or with the dating of it by reference to its content. Much research
has been put into this aspect of ballad literature but it can
usually tell us only the date of <hi rend="italic">first</hi> publication. That a
ballad was composed in the reign of James I will not help us when
we come to a printing of it that obviously belongs to the reign of
his elder grandson. The vast majority of the ballads on which
appear the imprints I have listed were ballads with a popular but
largely non-topical appeal&mdash;tales of romance and Robin Hood rather
than

<pb n="006.163"/>

celebrations of victory and satires on politicians. Their interest
lies, therefore, as much in their continued popularity as in their
origins.</item>

<item>(2) This section of the ballad market was profitable and
copyrights were jealously guarded. There are many entries in the
earlier Registers of the Stationers' Company to action taken
against the infringers of such copyrights; the existence of the
partnership may help to account for the surprisingly small amount
of evidence of infringement after the Restoration.</item>

<item>(3) The owners of ballad copyrights were not always
booksellers of the meaner sort, as is sometimes suggested; they
left tidy sums to their widows and children; they played their
parts in the affairs of the Company, held shares in the English
Stock and became Wardens; Vere even became Master.</item>

<item>(4) I have found no evidence to support the statement,
occasionally made, that the Stationers' Company had a Ballad Stock
just as it had an English or a Latin Stock. Arber is right, I
think, when he refers to the voluntary formation of a common stock
of ballads by certain members of the Company, and it is with this
stock that I am concerned. The original confusion may have arisen
from a list in the Bagford Papers of "ye names of ye pattentes for
ye printing of Balletes", a list constructed, I suspect, from
imprints. I want, however, to make it clear that each member of the
group was at the same time "publishing" on his own account&mdash;both
books and ballads, both alone and jointly with other book-sellers,
sometimes with other members of the ballad group.</item>

<item>(5) It is essential for the proving of my theory that
different printings of the same ballad should be found, one
printing bearing one of the imprints listed above and another
printing bearing another from the list. I have therefore taken as
my key the immense entry in the Registers made in the names of
Coles, Vere, Wright, and Clarke on 1 March 1675. From this list of
196 titles, 90 per cent of which are ballads, there can be found
examples bearing all the imprints except two, the first and the
last.<ref target="f006.11.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref> Some of the old titles may
drop out; new ones are certainly added; but there is a hard core of
common stock, and it is difficult to understand why a ballad
bearing, for instance, imprints A and G should have been missed
from the 1675 entry.</item>


<item>(6) A few surviving copies of ballads, bearing imprints with
which I am concerned, have dates added in manuscript. <hi rend="italic">The
Dutchess of Ports-mouths Farewel</hi> (B. M. Luttrell II, f168) has
"20 feb 1685/4" in the handwriting of Narcissus Luttrell and
imprint L (my dates 1684 to 1686). Anthony Wood wrote "1660" and
"Sept 1660" and "1661" on three ballads

<pb n="006.164"/>

(Bodley, Wood 402, ff 174, 176, and 180) bearing imprint C (my
dates 1658 to 1664). All I can say of this possible aid to dating
(as of the very occasional printed date) is that I have found
nothing to alter the conclusions I have reached. I would, however,
like to shew its very real danger by reference to a ballad called
<hi rend="italic">Loves Carouse</hi> which is dated "1674" in manuscript (Luttrell
II, f133); this ballad has the imprint of Francis Grove who had
been dead since 1663.</item>

<item>(7) Just as I have deliberately avoided using the contents of
a ballad as a guide to the dating of a particular printing of it,
so I have made no attempt to use the evidence which lies in a study
of the types and cuts employed in the printing of the ballads. What
I hope is that someone with expert knowledge of this subject will
think it worth while to work within the dating framework I have
constructed and either prove my dating wrong or dispose of some of
the overlaps. Even if this cannot be done, it would be interesting
to know something more of the printers who were engaged in the
printing of the ballads.</item>

<item>(8) That a ballad was a piece of paper printed on one side
only,<ref target="f006.11.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref> like the announcement of a
Jumble Sale, does not mean that it rapidly found its way into (what
I am sure was not thought necessary in the seventeenth century) the
waste-paper-basket. Reading matter was too scarce and valuable;
besides, there was not then the sharp distinction we make between
bound books which we keep and newspapers and magazines which are
almost immediately expendable. Ballads, of the popular literature
kind, may be "ephemeral" now, but I doubt if they were so regarded
in the seventeenth century by the purchasers for whom they were
printed. "O sister," says Cokes to Mistress Overdo in
<hi rend="italic">Bartholomew Fair,</hi> "doe you remember the ballads over the
Nursery-chimney at home o' my owne pasting up?" Fortunately for us,
there were&mdash;among those who normally bought books rather than
ballads&mdash;collectors like Selden and Pepys, Bagford and Anthony
Wood, who rescued copies
while they were still obtainable; and there were educated men who
enjoyed <hi rend="italic">reading</hi> them. According to Hearne (8 June 1711),
the
Earl of Dorset, "a man of admirable sense and understanding," had
a fine collection of ballads which he used to read with delight for
their "simplicity and nakedness of style", and the Dean of Christ
Church was ready to spend a good sum for a similar
accumulation.</item>


<item>(9) I must record the immense amount of help I have received,
in my chasing of ballads, to Hyder E. Rollins' <hi rend="italic">An Analytical
Index to the Ballad-Entries</hi>

<pb n="006.165"/>

<hi rend="italic">1557-1709</hi> ("Studies in Phiology," XXI (Jan. 1924). This is
a marvellous tool and is frequently referred to here as 'Rollins'.
In addition, the publications of the Ballad Society and Rollins'
edition of the Pepys Ballads, though they do not cut out the
necessity of handling real ballads, do reduce the number of hours
so spent.</item>
</list>

<p>Though I have taken 1655 as the earliest date for a joint
imprint, I must go back to 1618 for what I think is the beginning
of the story. The idea of Patents and Monopolies was in the air,
and in October of that year Thomas Symcocke prayed the King to
grant him a Patent for the sole printing of everything that was
printed on one side only. This was granted jointly to him (though
he had no connection with the printing trade) and to Roger Wood (a
real printer) for 31 years on payment of &pound;10 a year. The
Stationers' Company immediately protested
<ref target="f006.11.03" n="3"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref> but it was not until 24 August
1622
that James was moved to instruct the Lord Chief Justice of the
King's Bench to enquire fully into Symcocke's Patent. It happened
that Thomas Pavier, one of those chiefly interested in the ballad
trade, had been elected Renter Warden in July 1622; it looks as if
he was enabled, by his official position, to compel the Company to
make a stronger appeal to the
King.<ref target="f006.11.04" n="4"><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref></p>
<p>It is difficult to discover what followed during the next two
years; the only certainty is that ballads still exist with the
imprint "Printed by the Assigns of Thomas Symcocke". But on 14
December 1624, 128 ballads, mostly old ones, were entered in the
Registers as the joint property of six booksellers&mdash;Thomas Pavier,
John Wright, his brothers Cuthbert and Edward, John Grismond, and
Henry Gosson. The family ties of the group were strengthened by the
marriages of Cuthbert Wright, Grismond, and Gosson to daughters of
Pavier. On 19 June 1625 there was a further entry of ten ballads.
This entry comes not in its chronological place but at the very end
of the pages for the year 1624/5 and is the first of a series of
annual entries by the partners at about this time. The principle of
private ownership in ballad stock had been firmly established so
far as the Company was concerned.</p>
<p>But Symcocke was not yet finished; in 1628 his Patent was
renewed.

<pb n="006.166"/>

The Company immediately challenged its validity in the Court of
Chancery, and a committee of enquiry appointed by the King reported
against Symcocke. Finally the Patent was cancelled by a decree of
the Court of Chancery dated 30 June 1629, though Symcocke was to be
compensated for his expenditure on printing equipment.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Pavier had died (early in 1626) and Francis Coles had
taken his place in the partnership.
<ref target="f006.11.05" n="5"><hi rend="super">5</hi></ref> By the end of 1638 Cuthbert
Wright and
Grismond were dead;<ref target="f006.11.06" n="6"><hi rend="super">6</hi></ref> Gosson
disappeared about 1640 and John Wright died early in 1646, leaving
everything to his brother Edward, the last of the original gang.
When Edward made his will in 1651, having probably already retired
to his East Haddon home, he appointed as executors Coles and his
cousin John Wright, hitherto known as "junior"; and on 4 and 5
April 1655, about a year before he died, he assigned a large number
of Copies to William Gilbertson. Here, then, are three out of the
four names in my first imprint; the fourth, Thomas Vere, only
appeared as a partner on 13 March 1656 (in an entry in the
Registers), but he always took precedence of Gilbertson.
<ref target="f006.11.07" n="7"><hi rend="super">7</hi></ref> Copyrights which had once been
owned
jointly by six booksellers were now owned jointly
and equally by four others.</p>
<p>How exactly this rearrangement took place is perhaps of little
importance; but I should like to be able to answer the question,
"What were the imprints of those 128 ballads which were entered
jointly in 1624 and printed in the succeeding 30 years?" Arguing
from later practice I would have expected them to carry the names
of all the partners who were active at the time of printing. But I
have not come across a single example of such an imprint, and it is
extremely unlikely that they have all disappeared. On those ballads
which might have been printed during this dark age, overshadowed by
the threat or the reality of the Civil War, the only imprints I
have come across are "By the Assigns of Thomas Symcocke" or "For"
one of the individual partners in the ballad stock. The most
interesting examples are those ballads of which there are copies
bearing different imprints. <hi rend="italic">A pleasant new Court Song,</hi>
beginning "Upon a Summer's

<pb n="006.167"/>

time, In the middle of the morne" (Rollins 1865), appears in the
Roxburghe Collection as "Printed by the Assignes of Thomas
Symcocke" and in the Pepys collection as "Printed for Ed. Wright".
<hi rend="italic">A pleasant Court Song</hi> was entered by John Wright on 19
June
1625 as part of the annual registration to which I have referred.
Again, <hi rend="italic">An excellent Ballad Intituled The Constancy of
Susanna</hi> (Rollins 379 and 2563), beginning "There dwelt a man in
Babylon", is among the big joint entries of 1624 and 1675; some
copies are found "Printed at London for Iohn Wright, neere Pye
Corner" and others for Henry Gosson. (Yet other examples have
imprint O or "For W[illiam] O[nley]".)</p>
<p>I can prove nothing, but the following hypotheses occurred to me
when trying to answer this question about the imprints between 1624
and 1655:&mdash;

<list>
<item>(1) That the partners, either jointly or severally, were
until 1629, Symcocke's Assigns&mdash;at least as distributors; Roger
Wood may have looked after the printing. This is made slightly
improbable by STC 19246 which has "By the Assignes of T. Symcocks,
sold by F. Grove".</item>

<item>(2) That from 1618 to 1629 Symcocke through unknown assigns
and the partners (individually until 1624 and thereafter together)
were issuing the same ballads in opposition to each other. But
these two alternatives only take us to 1629; and how were chapmen
to know where to collect supplies of Symcocke's printings?</item>

<item>(3) That, after the withdrawal of Symcocke in 1629, the
partners issued a ballad not with a joint imprint but with the
imprint of that member of the group who had first claim to its
copyright, and that the main purpose of the group was not so much
manufacture (and copyright protection) as distribution.</item>

<item>(4) That&mdash;as a variation of (3)&mdash;each partner received
his
share of a printing with only his name in the imprint.</item>

<item>(5) That the Wright and Gosson imprints quoted above belong
to the pre-Symcocke period (or at least to the pre-1624 period).
But this leaves the post-1629 period quite empty and I can only
repeat that it is extremely unlikely&mdash;even allowing for the impact
of the Civil War and the Puritan attitude to the singing of
ballads&mdash;that no ballads registered by the partners were issued
between 1629 and 1655 or that, if they were issued, none have
survived.</item>
</list>
</p>
<p>Further variations and extensions of these possibilities could
be devised, but until more evidence comes to light the verdict must
be left open. In view of the existence of seventeenth-century
partnership books, identical in every way except that they bear
different imprints for different partners, I favour alternative (4)
combined with alternative (2).

<pb n="006.168"/>

But I must leave speculation and produce my evidence for the
imprints.</p>
<p>A.) <hi rend="italic">Printed for F. Coles, J. Wright, T. Vere, and W.
Gilbertson 1655-1658</hi></p>
<p>On 13 March 1656 these four entered 28 ballads, at least ten of
which had been entered at various times before. This entry, like
Francis Grove's of 25 the day before, was an abnormally large one
and suggests either a renewal of publishing activity (a view which
a sudden outcrop of booksellers' catalogues at this date supports),
or a threat of infringement, or (though not with Grove) a settling
down to a new partnership arrangement. Perhaps it was a bit of
each. Since John Wright was buried on 11 May 1658 (Smyth's
<hi rend="italic">Obituary,</hi> Camden Soc., 1849, p. 47), the end of the imprint
is certain; and since very few ballads have survived with this set
of names I have not put the earliest date further back than 1655,
which gives the partnership nearly fifteen months before the first
entry in the Registers; moreover, 1655 was the year in which Edward
Wright assigned a number of copyrights to Gilbertson.
<ref target="f006.11.08" n="8"><hi rend="super">8</hi></ref> Martin Parker's <hi rend="italic">The
distressed
Virgin</hi>
(B.M.c.20.f.14, no. 11) has this imprint. It was entered to the
partners on 1 June 1629 and in the Crawford Collection there is a
version with imprint G; STC 19228 is for Coles alone. It is
surprising not to find it in the 1675 entry when it was obviously
part of the ballad stock.</p>
<p>B.) <hi rend="italic">Printed for F. Coles, M. Wright, T. Vere, and W.
Gilbertson 1658</hi></p>
<p>Mary, the widow of John Wright, was left with two youngish boys,
the elder of whom (another John: how often one wishes for a little
more imagination in the choosing of Christian names!) was made free
of the Stationers' Company by patrimony on 5 October 1663. His
mother kept on the business and may have intended to take his
father's place in the ballad partnership until young John could
step in. The other partners, perhaps, thought otherwise; none of
them is, oddly enough, mentioned in the will. By 26 July the name
of Wright has dropped out of the partnership entries in the
Registers. <hi rend="italic">The ranting whores resolution</hi> (Wing R 255,
Rollins 2238) is one of the very few ballads with this imprint; it
appears in the Roxburghe Collection, dated 1672, with imprint
E.<ref target="f006.11.09" n="9"><hi rend="super">9</hi></ref></p>
<p>C.) <hi rend="italic">Printed for F. Coles, T. Vere, and W. Gilbertson
1658-1664</hi></p>
<p>Young John Wright was free in October 1663; Gilbertson did not
die until

<pb n="006.169"/>

early in 1665. I have, however, come across no ballad imprint
bearing both his name and Gilbertson's. The only context in which
the names occur together is <hi rend="italic">The famous History of Parismus</hi>.
On 9 August 1664 Gilbertson assigned &frac34; of his copyright in this
little book (which he and Francis Grove had entered together on 10
March 1661) to Coles, Vere, and Wright; the seventh impression is
recorded by Esdaile (<hi rend="italic">A List of English Tales</hi> . . ., Bib.
Soc. London, 1912) as dated 1664. That is why I think that imprint
C should include 1664 but not 1665. Incidentally, Francis Grove's
will was proved in March 1663 (P.C.C. 44 Juxon). He was a prolific
issuer of ballads, many of which are in the 1675 entry; the entry
and reassignment of <hi rend="italic">Parismus</hi> suggests that his ballad
copyrights may have found their way into the ballad stock through
Gilbertson. <hi rend="italic">Room for a joviall tinker</hi> (Wing R1921, Rollins
2323) is an example with this imprint; there is another version
(Wing R1922)
with imprint H.</p>
<p>D.) <hi rend="italic">Printed for F. Coles, T. Vere, W. Gilbertson, and J.
Wright 1663-1665</hi></p>
<p>If this imprint turns up on a ballad, it must be dated between
late 1663 and early 1665, since Gilbertson
<ref target="f006.11.10" n="10"><hi rend="super">10</hi></ref> died between 29 March and 15
April of
the latter year and Wright was not free until the Autumn of 1663.
It must be remembered, however, that copyrights in the ballad stock
were treated as separate from a bookseller's normal copyrights in
books and that a partnership imprint on a book is no argument for
a similar ballad imprint.</p>
<p>E.) <hi rend="italic">Printed for F. Coles, T. Vere, and J. Wright
1663-1674</hi></p>
<p>Though the partners, except perhaps for Pavier, seem to have
survived the various outbreaks of the plague, they suffered badly
in the fire of 1666. The members of the 1624 group had had shops in
or around Newgate Street, except for Henry Gosson who was on London
Bridge, the other main centre of the ballad trade. In 1666 the
three partners were all in the Old Bailey. They were burnt out but
they did not move very far. Coles went to Vine Street, on Saffron
Hill near Hatton Garden, Vere to Giltspur Street, just outside
Newgate, and Wright to Little Britain. Little Britain ran direct
into West Smithfield; Giltspur Street indirectly through Pye
Corner. It was here, in Pye Corner, that the Ballad Warehouse was
finally

<pb n="006.170"/>

located and it was here that the booksellers interested in the
distribution of ballads congregated towards the end of the
century.</p>
<p>In spite of the disturbance of the fire a fair number of ballads
with this imprint have survived. <hi rend="italic">Pride's fall</hi> (Wing P3447,
Rollins 2194/5) is typical. An interesting development of this
period is the holding of a joint stock of small books as well as
ballads. As Nathaniel Crouch was to demonstrate, the market was
ready for something more solid than the single sheet. Samuel
Rowlands' <hi rend="italic">Doctor Merrieman,</hi> for instance, occurs as printed

by E. Crowch for these three in 1671, having been printed by R. I.
for Francis Grove in 1657; it also appears in 1681 with imprint G
and is one of the last entries in 1675 (Wing R2081/3; since it is
not a ballad there is no reference in Rollins). A similar entry is
<hi rend="italic">Hey for Horn Fair,</hi> of which the only edition given by Wing
(H1658A) has this imprint and is dated 1674. John Clarke,
therefore, who on 27 January 1673 entered some ballads which were
afterwards absorbed into the partnership stock, was certainly not
one of the group
<hi rend="italic">before</hi> 1674; whether or not he was <hi rend="italic">during</hi> the
year
I
do not know, but we must allow the possibility; just as we must
allow the possibility of Gilbertson's being out and Wright in
during 1663.</p>
<p>F.) <hi rend="italic">Printed for F. Coles, T. Vere, J. Wright, and J. Clarke
1674-1679</hi></p>
<p>We now get to the most important entry of all, that of 1 March
1675 when were "Entred by mutuall consent . . . . (and by an order
of a full court of assistants) to each of them the said Francis
Coles, Thomas Veere, John Wright and John Clarke, severally a
fourth part of all the bookes, Ballads and copies . . . . hereafter
following. . . ." The 196 titles occupy five pages in the
Registers, but there is no indication of the fee paid for
entering.</p>
<p>The order in which the ballads are listed seems to conform to a
rough pattern. Of the first 80, 70 were entered before to one or
other of the groups of partners, four to other booksellers and six
for the first time. Of the next twenty-five, fourteen were
previously entered to Francis Grove, four to other booksellers and
seven for the first time. Of the next fifty all but five (three to
Grove and two to Jno Clarke) were then entered for the first time.
Most of the rest are not ballads. It looks, therefore, as if the
ballads were listed in the order in which they were acquired.
Assignments were seldom recorded in the Registers and some ballads
might have been first issued by the partners, or of course by
others, without registration: many of the titles listed here for
the first time must, almost certainly, have been originally the
property of other booksellers.</p>
<p>In the <hi rend="italic">Bagford Ballads</hi> (Hertford, 1878, p. 1117) J. W.
Ebsworth says that "before 1675 began the Licensing of all Ballad
Singers for five

<pb n="006.171"/>

years" was rented to John Clarke by Charles Kelligrew, Master of
the Revels at St. Bartholomew's Fair; but he does not quote his
authority. It is possible that the granting of this privilege had
something to do with Clarke's joining the partnership.</p>
<p>This partnership of four certainly lasted until 1 July 1678 when
they made two entries in the Registers. Some time between then and
September 1680, when Coles' will was proved, Thackeray and
Passinger parted company with William Whitwood and joined the
partnership. Until more evidence comes to light the dates of these
two imprints must be allowed to overlap. In view of the large
number of surviving ballads with the imprint of six names (at least
as many as those bearing the imprint of the first four only) I am
tempted to associate Vere's becoming Upper Warden in July 1679 with
the introduction of new blood; Whitwood had, before Easter 1680,
moved from the Smithfield area to the Strand, thereby putting the
seal on his break with the ballad-merchants. <hi rend="italic">A most excellent
song of the love of young Palmus</hi> (Wing M2883, Rollins 1804)
carries this imprint as well as a later one; it was entered in the
Registers under various titles.</p>
<p>G.) <hi rend="italic">Printed for F. Coles, T. Vere, J. Wright, J. Clarke, W.
Thackeray, and T. Passinger 1678-1680</hi></p>
<p>I have already referred to Coles' death by September 1680. The
opening date of this important partnership of six must still remain
uncertain, but it cannot have been before 1678. <hi rend="italic">The dying tears
of a panitent sinner</hi> (Wing D2958, Rollins 658) will do as well
as any other example of this imprint.</p>
<p>H.) <hi rend="italic">Printed for M. Coles, T. Vere, J. Wright, J. Clarke, W.
Thackeray, and T. Passinger 1680-1682</hi></p>
<p>M. Coles is Mary, the widow of Francis, whose name I have found
on a few ballads only. <hi rend="italic">The wandring prince and princess</hi>
(Wing W700, Rollins 2842) is one and it is found entered under
various titles. It is probable that Mary's name only appeared while
her husband's estate was being wound up. It is possible that Vere
sold out about the same time; there is an assignment of his to John
Clarke dated 5 September 1681, though there is, as usual, no
mention of ballads. I have no evidence that the name of Vere
appeared on a <hi rend="italic">ballad</hi> without that of Coles at this end of
the partnership, but <hi rend="italic">Parismus</hi> again provides the imprint on
a <hi rend="italic">book</hi>. Vol. I has imprint G and the date 1681;
<ref target="f006.11.11" n="11"><hi rend="super">11</hi></ref> vol. II has the same imprint and

Stationers' Company

<pb n="006.172"/>

in July 1681 and died between the meetings of the Court on 6 and 21
February 1682, a few days after the death of Thomas Newcomb, one of
his Wardens. There is a remote possibility that a ballad appeared
with this imprint in January 1682; I have therefore included this
year.<ref target="f006.11.12" n="12"><hi rend="super">12</hi></ref></p>

<p>Though Vere did not die until early in 1682, he may have
disposed of his holding in the ballad stock during the previous
year. The end came with the death of John Wright between 1 and 20
October 1684. Tobias Bowne's <hi rend="italic">The two faithful lovers</hi> has
this imprint as well as imprint F and a later one (Wing B3898/3900,
Rollins 2762).</p>
<p>L.) <hi rend="italic">Printed for J. Clarke, W. Thackeray, and T. Passinger
1684-1686</hi></p>
<p>John Wright was a man of property and standing; he owned farms
in several counties, houses in London and stock in the Stationers'
Company. The overseers of his will were Thomas Basset, Richard
Chiswell, Samuel Sprint, and Thomas Passinger, and one of his
executors was a Doctor of Divinity. But all his children were
minors and there was no arrangement made for retaining his share in
the ballad stock. The next to go was John Clarke. He made his will
on 16 August 1686 when he was "very sick &amp; weake in body", but he
probably did not die till the year was nearly out. He was a widower
with one minor son, Thomas; and I have the impression from his will
that he did not get on well with his relatives. There is no mention
of ballad copyrights but one of the witnesses was John Millet, the
printer of ballads. As an example of this imprint there is <hi rend="italic">A
letter for a Christian family</hi> [?by John Vicars] (Wing V315,
Rollins 1492), which also occurs with a later imprint.</p>
<p>M.) <hi rend="italic">Printed for W. Thackeray, and T. Passinger
1686-1688</hi></p>
<p>I have included 1686 in order to be on the safe side, but the
bulk of the issuing of ballads with this imprint must have been in
1687 and the first

<pb n="006.173"/>

half of 1688. <hi rend="italic">The bride's burial</hi> (Wing B4443, Rollins 238)
will serve as a cheerful example. Passinger's will is the most
interesting of all the wills because he specifically mentions "all
my share in the Ballad warehouse of all the stocke and Copyes of
books and ballads which I now have in partnership with Mr. William
Thackeraye in a Warehouse in Pye Corner". These he leaves to his
nephew and apprentice Thomas Passinger, with the instruction that
the ballads are to be kept in print "as formerly in the said
Warehouse" until the expiration of Thomas' apprenticeship. This
should have occurred in 1690 but for some reason did not do so
until June 1693. Thackeray had in the meantime taken over all the
copyrights, perhaps when young Passinger came of age in 1690.</p>
<p>N.) <hi rend="italic">Printed for W. Thackeray 1688-1689</hi></p>
<p>For about eighteen months Thackeray, the last of the six, had
the field to himself. <hi rend="italic">A most godly and comfortable ballad of the
glorious resurrection</hi> (Wing M2892, Rollins 972) will stand as
an example of the many issued by Thackeray alone. To him we owe the
most complete printed list of seventeenth-century ballads that has
survived (B.M. c.40.m.10, no.2). It is a sheet measuring 15&frac14;''
by 12'', printed on one side only and headed "These small Books,
Ballads and Histories undernamed, are all Printed for and Sold by
WILLIAM THACKERAY at the <hi rend="italic">Angel</hi> in Duck-lane,
London;
where
any Chapman may be furnished with them or any other Books at
Reasonable Rates." There follow six columns, 3&frac14; of which are
taken up with 301 ballads. After a gap for adding new titles are
sections for Broad Sheets, Small Godly Books, Small Merry Books,
Double Books, and Histories. J. W. Ebsworth, in his introduction to
the <hi rend="italic">Bagford Ballads</hi> (p.liii), thinks this list was issued in
late March or early April 1685 on the grounds that no. 170 of the
ballads, <hi rend="italic">English Traveller</hi>, refers to James II's accession
and that none of the ballads issued later in the year, during
Monmouth's rebellion, appear. I entirely agree with the first part
of his argument, so far as <hi rend="italic">first</hi> publication is concerned,
but I doubt whether his second carries much weight in the Ballad
Warehouse. Coles &amp; Co. were much more interested in the
traditional ballad than in the topical; booksellers like Brooksby,
Deacon, Dean and Bates put their names to the Monmouth ballads. I
feel that if Clarke and Passinger had been partners in these
ballads, as they were in 1685, their names would also have appeared
in the advertisement, the normal practice when a whole block of
publications is held in co-partnership. Moreover the title of
<hi rend="italic">English Traveller</hi> is buried, amongst old stuff,
three-quarters of the way down the second column&mdash;not a good place

for a recent issue. These are
reasons for not dating the list 1685; my argument for dating it
1689 will come better under the discussion of the next imprint.</p>

<pb n="006.174"/>

<p>Of the 301 ballads listed I will only say that the first
twenty-one are all to do with Robin Hood, far and away the most
popular ballad figure, and that a very high proportion of them are
found in the Register entries, many of them more than once. It must
have been a trade list compiled for use of Hawkers and Chapmen, and
it is interesting to speculate how they carried a sheet of this
size so that it was usable.</p>
<p>O.) <hi rend="italic">Printed for W. Thackeray, J. Millet, and A. Milbourn

<p>The list of booksellers begins to expand again. In the Pepys
Library, pages 439-443 of MS 2509 are a copy, which Pepys must have
had made to go with his ballad collection, of "The present
Adjustment &amp; Settlement of the Stock of ye Ancient <hi rend="italic">Ballad

to it in passing and calls it an Indenture of the Stationers'
Company; it certainly reads as though it had been drawn up by an
organization in order to prevent squabbling among its members. The
preamble is so interesting that I quote it in full with the kind
permission of the Master and Fellows of Magdalene College,
Cambridge:&mdash;

</p>
<p>There follows a large number of clauses governing various
aspects of the partnership: that the stock and profits shall be
equally divided; that

<pb n="006.175"/>

the stock shall be kept in and issued from the Warehouse, where the
account books shall also be kept and be accessible to Millet and
Milbourn; that all dues "shall be equally born out of ye sayd Stock
and Profits"; that no partner shall dispose of his interest or
introduce a further partner without the consent of the others; that
the Ballads etc. shall be printed by Millet and Milbourn on paper
supplied by Thackeray, and shall bear the imprint of all; that no
Copyright shall be bought, no printing done and no prices fixed
except by a majority decision and that the partners shall meet at
least once in two months to settle accounts; that there shall be no
printing or selling (save of the Thackeray Copies deliberately
excepted) "but what shall be done for the Joynt Benefit of ye
Whole"; that the partners shall not be liable for other partners'
debts. On the death of a partner the others shall make up the
accounts within 14 days and, within a month, pay his executors "a

Copies to be bought hereafter, two printers and two booksellers
shall be chosen to value them, and if the executors refuse to
accept the valuation they shall, provided they are members of the
Stationers' Company, became partners for a third share. ". . . . In
case Thackeray shall in his Life-time desire to assign-over his
Share herein to his Son Tho: Thackeray, or that the sayd Tho: shall
upon his Father's Death, desire to be receiv'd into this
Co-partnership in the Room of his Father", the others shall accept
him. Each partner bound
himself and his executors in the sum of &pound;200 to abide by this
agreement. The Schedule attached to the Indenture might have served
as the printer's "copy" for Thackeray's List described above. The
only difference I have been able to find in title or order is under
the heading of "Broad Sheets". In the printed version there are
three titles; in the Schedule these three occur and <hi rend="italic">Young-man
and death</hi> has been added. This almost complete similarity is
the strongest argument for giving these two lists the same date,
1689. The printed version may have been issued when the Chapman
went out in the spring, the other compiled from it at the end of
December, a few days before the Indenture was signed.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Millet was granted administration of her husband's
property on the strength of a bond signed on 24 November by herself
and Alexander and Thomas Milbourn. I have only found one ballad
with this imprint, <hi rend="italic">The Wanton Wife of Bath</hi> (Wing W722,
Rollins 2962). This does not occur in the 1675 entry, but it was
entered as long before as 1600 and it does occur both in the
Thackeray List and with the imprint O.</p>
<p>On 20 September 1712, almost exactly twenty years after John
Millet's death, Charles Brown and Thomas Norris made an enormous
entry in the Registers, which bears a resemblance to Thackeray's
List. They staked their claim, a half share each, to 71 old
Ballads, 6 old Broadsides, 46 old "Sheets &amp; half", along with a
number of "Three Sheet Books", "Stitcht Histories", "Bound Books",
and "Books in 32". With the reemergence of provincial printing at
the very end of the seventeenth century, the metropolitan trade in
popular literature had begun to concentrate rather on chap-books
than on ballads; Brown and Norris clung to what was still worth
preserving of the latter.</p>
<p>Of what happened to the Ballad Warehouse during these twenty
years I can give no account. I will, however, list the imprints I
have come across from ballads of which all are included in
Thackeray's List and all but two in the 1675 entry. I will also
arrange them in the order in which I think they occurred, in the
hope that someone may have evidence to prove the order right or
wrong. I am unable to provide dates.</p>

        ballads&mdash;from the well-known Angel&mdash;as well as the printing
        of
        them. The small number of surviving ballads with this imprint
        suggests that he was quicker to discover his mistake than old
        Milbourn. Onley's enterprise and ingenuity also led him to infringe
        copy-rights (see Plomer's <hi rend="italic">Dictionary, 1668-1725</hi>), and his
        entry into the ballad partnership may have been due to a threat of

<item>After young Thackeray's retirement and the printers' short
attempt to distribute by themselves, Onley and Milbourn went
through the same sort of rigmarole as old Milbourn had tried some
years earlier&mdash;general trade, ballad trade, and then individual
booksellers known to be expert in this kind of distribution. It
would be interesting to know what extra terms Bates and the others
insisted on. It is worth noting, as a pointer to the specialization
in this kind of business, that Mary Wright trained Jonah Deacon,
who in turn trained Charles Bates, and that Joshua Conyers was free
of the Company by patrimony. I have no evidence to suggest a
chronological significance in the variations of this imprint; they
may have been tried concurrently, but I have come across no example
to suggest that some copies of the same printing of a ballad had
"to be sold by J. Deacon" while others had "to be sold by C.
Bates", as might have happened before 1655.</item>

<item>Norris and Brown had taken the cream of the old Ballad
Warehouse stock, and the Registers prove the continuity of the
inheritance. But the glory has departed; you cannot expect to live
on your capital for ever. Coles &amp; Co. were essentially
Black-Letter merchants who pinned their faith to the conservatism
of ordinary people; unlike Brooksby and his partners, they were not
interested in the topical and did little to keep their list
up-to-date. When people turned against Black Letter at the end of
the seventeenth century, their business, as carried on by their
successors, was really finished. There was, of course, no nice
clean ending; it guttered out in the stronger light of the
eighteenth-century chap-book and the purely topical ballad. William
Thackeray was the last of the old gang and, owing to the luck of
surviving documents, the most interesting to us I can find no
evidence for his departure, nor for his son's. Perhaps they saw the
writing on the wall and retired while
the going was good; perhaps they just died. Some one else may be
able to supply evidence of one or the other.</item>
</list>

<p>In conclusion, I should like to repeat that I began this study
because certain partnership imprints in Wing caught my eye. I have
traced the existence, for upwards of 40 years, of a healthy
partnership which was almost entirely concerned with the issuing of
a single kind of publication. Whether the Ballad Partnership was
ever called a "Conger" (as similar groups of booksellers were
called in the eighteenth century), or whether the founders of the
Printing Conger knew anything of the working of the Ballad
Warehouse, I do not know. But the idea was in the air, and what was
successful over a narrow publishing field was later adapted for the
manufacture and sale of a wide variety of useful books.</p>

<p>I group here the evidence I have been able to collect about the
early training of the booksellers involved in this storv. Two
points of interest emerge. One is the specialist nature of the
ballad market; not only is there a strong family influence but the
apprentices of ballad-merchants

<pb n="006.180"/>

seem to be trained to become ballad-merchants. The other is the
strict seniority which is almost always observed in imprints. For
added interest I have included the Brooksby group whom Bagford
calls "the modern pattentes".</p>

to John Wright junior on 13 June 1642. I suspect that the ballads
were reassigned without registration&mdash;as, of course, often
happened, particularly where partnership adjustment was
involved&mdash;before 1 June 1629 when Coles' name first appeared in
the Registers as a partner. At the end of the same month the

<name type="title">Chain-Indentations in Paper as Evidence</name>
<lb/><hi rend="italic">by</hi><lb/> <name type="author">Allan
Stevenson</name>
</head>

<div2 type="section"><head></head>
<p>It is clear that any variation in the materials or manufacture
of printed books may provide the analytical bibliographer with
useful evidence. The kinds of evidence that prove especially useful
are those whose variations are definite and measurable and whose
manifestations are not overly ambiguous or complex. Within the past
half-century a good many forms of bibliographical evidence have
been noted and analyzed, and have proved their value, singly or
together, in solving problems. Still, some forms of evidence remain
for notice and trial.</p>
<p>One of these is the indentations left by the moulds (or roller)
in all laid paper. Anyone who examines old handmade paper can see
the ribs made by the fine laid wires and the troughs or grooves
made by the chain wires, and thus can distinguish the "right" side
or mould side from the "wrong" side or rough side of the
paper.<ref target="f006.12.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref> Nevertheless, no general
use appears to have been made of a characteristic so obvious and
omnipresent. These wire and chain indentations are in effect
watermarks; and in certain respects the chainmarks are easier to
use than the designs called watermarks. Whereas watermarks and
countermarks have a way of obscuring themselves within the folds of
quartos and octavos, or behind layers of type in the folio page,
chainlines can be seen in any margin, if the paper is "laid". Their
regularity can be observed, their spaces measured, their sewing
marks noted, their indentations studied for the information they
may afford concerning the
making of books. Though most characteristics of chains persist in
machine-made laid, their evidential value is particularly clear in
paper made at the vat.</p>
<p>Usually the indented side is immediately apparent, though not
obtrusive: a thing to be determined in a moment's examination.
<ref target="f006.12.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref> When the

<pb n="006.182"/>

paper has thickness or body and the chain wires are heavy, the
sunken lines are easy to see. When the paper is thin and the wires
are light, determination of the indented side may be less easy, may
take half a minute for decision. Occasionally, indeed, the
investigator may deceive himself, for portions of the indentations
may appear to have fallen through. The smoothing and polishing
which papers received in the mills before being folded into quires
and packed in reams no doubt contributed to such an effect. Also,
paper that has been washed and ironed by modern improvers of old
books offers a problem&mdash;particularly in title pages, where
indentation evidence can be crucial. And a well-thumbed leaf of the
Bay Psalm Book may not yield an answer so readily as a plate in the
<hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions</hi> of the Royal Society. Ordinarily,
however, when the indented side is not immediately discernible, one
need merely hold the leaf below a good undiffused light&mdash;God's sun
or a 75-watt
mazda bulb&mdash;with the chains parallel with the eyes and the book or
leaf tilted at an angle, so that a slight shadow marks the troughs.
Then some or all of the grooves will appear, particularly in the
upper and lower margins of folios and the fore-edges of quartos,
where the chain wires in the mould approached the frame. At the
same moment the pattern of the main watermark (if present) may
become clear enough to decide the question. In uncertain cases it
is well to examine the opposite leaf and other leaves apparently
belonging to the sheet&mdash;though this recourse may beg the question
at issue. It sometimes helps to consider the relative smoothness of
the two sides of the paper; for the unindented or "wrong" side may
seem a bit rougher to the touch or even slightly darker of hue,
because of the way the light strikes the fibers.
<ref target="f006.12.02a" n="2a"><hi rend="super">2a</hi></ref> But the grooves themselves are
the
more dependable evidence.</p>
<p>They are, indeed, as later paragraphs will show, among the
simplest and most reliable forms of bibliographical evidence. To be
sure, their testimony as regards a leaf-suspect in an individual
copy of a book may prove decisive just fifty per cent of the time.
This is because the grooves of an aberrant leaf will either agree
or not agree with those of the sheet of which it pretends to be a
part. The percentage improves when other copies become available
for comparison. Three copies raise the probabilities (of usefulness
or variation) to seventy-five; and four copies offer an efficiency
approaching ninety. Thus, despite their half-ambiguous ways,

<pb n="006.183"/>

indentations are likely to prove helpful in dealing with some types
of problems.</p>
<p>These problems have largely to do with conjugacy; with cancels
and other sorts of page-substitution. Such departures from the
normal include resettings, mixed editions, sophistications,
restorations. Beyond these lie more subtle possibilities, but they
must await a fuller understanding of paper.</p>
<p>So far as I am aware, there were no general rules or practices
as to the side of the sheet which should receive the impress of the
inner or the outer forme. Certain printers may have preferred the
smooth side of fine paper for title pages and plates, in an
endeavor to give a pleasing appearance to their books&mdash;though
surely any such intention was rare in Elizabethan and Stuart times.
Other printers, when preparing engraved frontispieces, titles,
plates, or maps, may have chosen instead the rougher side, as
taking the ink more readily and avoiding the small hazards of the
indentation-troughs. Similarly motivated selection of paper
surfaces is common enough today, and was known in the eighteenth
century. But few can have given it thought in the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries. For one thing, the French paper then
imported into England, whether because of fine linen rags or the
finishing process used, showed rather little difference in the two
sides of the sheet, apart from
the indentations, either to the eye or to the exploratory index
finger. Further, paper came to the London printer variously made up
into quires and reams, the order of the sheets and their
orientation being due to the nature of the moulds or the habit or
whim of the packer. Some mills are supposed to have made up quires
with the right side consistently outside the fold.
<ref target="f006.12.03" n="3"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref> But in other mills the variations
in
the moulds must have made consistency impracticable. As always,
paper was made on a pair of moulds, and these moulds varied in the
position of the main mark&mdash;some pairs having their marks in
opposite halves, some having them on the same side with one
reversed or even inverted. Inscriptions in the watermarks sometimes
read left to right with the indented side up, sometimes with it
down.<ref target="f006.12.04" n="4"><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref> Further study may

<pb n="006.184"/>

reveal a measure of consistency within a particular region or mill;
but there is not much to count on yet. And there is no need to

attention to sides as he laid out tokens for the press.
<ref target="f006.12.05" n="5"><hi rend="super">5</hi></ref></p>
<p>Bibliographers need to familiarize themselves with the way the
pages fall into place in all the common formats.
<ref target="f006.12.06" n="6"><hi rend="super">6</hi></ref> For instance, if in a quarto or
octavo
the first page of a gathering shows indentations, so will the
middle pages and the final page of the same sheet. Similarly, any
normal opening within a folded sheet will show the presence or
absence of indentations in <hi rend="italic">both</hi> pages open to view: grooves
opposite grooves. Exceptions naturally occur in gatherings made up
of more than one sheet or partsheet or in formats with a cutoff,
such as duodecimo. As the chances are perhaps against a duodecimo
sheet receiving its own cutoff (in which case
&dollar;4<hi rend="super">v</hi>-5<hi rend="super">r</hi> and
8<hi rend="super">v</hi>-9<hi rend="super">r</hi> would match), mismatching
indentations are hardly
evidence at the openings where the cutoffs fit into the rest of the
sheet.</p>
<p>All legitimate uses of indentations proceed from the basic fact
that they can be found on just one side of the sheet, that of the
inner or the outer forme.</p>
<p>Now as to cancels. It is apparent that if a leaf of a book has
been canceled there is about an even chance that the cancellans
will not agree with the cancellandum as to the side which shows
grooves. In something like half the cases the cancellans will have
an indented recto and the cancellandum an indented verso, or
vice-versa. The cancel will betray itself by the fact that its
grooves do not fit the pattern of the sheet.</p>
<p>The device is not necessarily one to use if other signs are
clear. There is no need to doubt a stub, which can be seen afar
off; though a cancel may use the wrong stub or no stub at all.
Paste too may be indubitable;

<pb n="006.185"/>

though it may be used also to join gatherings. Watermarks can be a
sure test, if they appear in helpful positions. When a literary
detective is inspecting a quarto and comes upon a fold with just
<hi rend="italic">half</hi> a watermark, he receives much the same shock as when
he
bites into a winesap and finds just half a <hi rend="italic">carpocapsa
pomonella</hi>.<ref target="f006.12.07" n="7"><hi rend="super">7</hi></ref> But sometimes
watermark evidence is not present, as in a quarto or octavo fold
when the mark is elsewhere, or in paper with no mark at all&mdash;as
often enough in the eighteenth century. Then indeed any
irregularities or sewing-marks found in the chains may be allowed
to serve as distinguishing watermarks; though their use is made
awkward by the presence of pairs of moulds and the fact that a
sheet can be fed into the press four different ways. Or again, as
Mr. R. W. Chapman has noted, the clue to a cancel may be faulty
alinement, or a change of font, or a leaf specially signed, or (in
the eighteenth century) a new press
figure.<ref target="f006.12.08" n="8"><hi rend="super">8</hi></ref> Such evidence may give
warning more abruptly than indentations; yet none of it is more
conclusive. For whenever the indentations in apparently conjugate
leaves do not agree, one of the leaves <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be a
cancel&mdash;or
some other form of substitution. In rebinding, stubs may disappear,
alinements may be improved, and paste may fail or deviate into
ambiguity; but grooves that do not match cannot be made to
match.<ref target="f006.12.09" n="9"><hi rend="super">9</hi></ref></p>
<p>For purposes of illustration old and familiar examples may serve
along with the new. I have found it instructive to check a number
of recorded instances, such as those mentioned in Mr. Chapman's
little volume on <hi rend="italic">Cancels</hi> (1930). For thus one may test the
usability of indentations and the manner in which they complement
other kinds of evidence.</p>
<p>Among well known cancels are several in Matthew Prior's
<hi rend="italic">Poems
on Several Occasions</hi> (1709) 8&deg;, and particularly the two at
A5 and A7 of the Dedication.<ref target="f006.12.10" n="10"><hi rend="super">10</hi></ref> The
paper is Italian, with some sheets watermarked IT or the leg of
Gambino, marks small enough to suffer from the binder's plow.
<ref target="f006.12.11" n="11"><hi rend="super">11</hi></ref> In the Newberry Library copy the
cancels are inserted as usual on stubs; but it is worth seeing how
the indentations work out.

<pb n="006.186"/>

Their prevailing pattern here in sheet A is <hi rend="italic">inner;</hi> that is,
they coincide with the inner forme. The grooves on cancel A5 appear
on its verso, opposite grooves on the recto of A6; thus those on
the cancel match those of the sheet, and they furnish no evidence.
Those on cancel A7, however, appear on its recto, opposite no
others; thus these do not match those of the sheet; and in this
instance the indentations are in themselves sufficient proof of
leaf-substitution. In the University of Chicago copy the grooves in
sheet A are likewise <hi rend="italic">inner;</hi> but here the grooves on both A5
and A7 are recto and fail to match those of the sheet. In this
manner do the two copies, indeed the Chicago copy by itself,
conclusively prove the presence of a pair of cancels. The stubs, as
it happens, are obvious; yet they might not show in a manicured or
tightly bound copy.</p>
<p>A promising area of employment for indentations is books printed
on unwatermarked paper, such as a good many demy quartos and
octavos of the eighteenth century. The reader may find it worth
while to check familiar examples of cancels in such books; as those
in

<p>Checking readily available copies, I have found that in three
copies of the Congreve (one on large paper and watermarked) the
grooves in the cancel perversely match those of the sheet. The
cancels in the Baskerville Milton, on laid paper with close thin
chains, are sufficiently numerous to provide instructive examples
in almost any copy. Those in the Newberry copy show mismatches at
G7, H5, T5, X6, Z5, and probably 2D2.
<ref target="f006.12.12" n="12"><hi rend="super">12</hi></ref> But some leaves are made difficult
by
the polishing or pressing which the paper has received, usually but
not always on its nonindented side.
<ref target="f006.12.13" n="13"><hi rend="super">13</hi></ref> In Percy's <hi rend="italic">Reliques</hi>
cancels
N7
and X4 have special signatures; but even where such signposts
exist, mismatching indentations may give final assurance. Gray's
<hi rend="italic">Poems,</hi> being a quarto, with horizontal chains, provides two
ways of using them in the identification of substitute leaves. In
the Chicago copy sheet 2K shows grooves on the versos of its
first three leaves, then grooves on the

<pb n="006.187"/>

recto of the fourth; in which situation the indentation pattern is
obviously <hi rend="italic">inner,</hi> and the misfit in the pattern is 2K2&mdash;a

leaf which is stubless in this copy. It is an easy rule that when
three consecutive leaves within a sheet have their grooves on the
same side (recto or verso)&mdash;the middle one is usually wrong. (The
Prior volume already discussed provides an interesting exception.)
Leaf h4 in the Gray (the first two pages of "The Elegy in a Country
Churchyard") shows, in the Chicago copy, verso indentations that
break the inner-forme pattern of sheet h, and so must be the cancel
that goes with the turnover between h1 and h2. Naturally, this
being a quarto, one finds that the chainlines of the cancels are
not prolongations of those in their pseudo-conjugates; but one
notes too that, whereas the break may appear abrupt and certain in
the inner fold of a quarto gathering (as in 2K2.3 in the Gray), it
may not seem so certain in an outer fold (as in h1.4 of the same).
Going
on to the Johnson volume, I have noted nothing special; but Allen
Hazen reports that in his copy the indentations prove that U4 is a
cancel. In this instance, though, the cancel-leaf contains a piece
of watermark&mdash;an intruder in an unwatermarked book.
<ref target="f006.12.14" n="14"><hi rend="super">14</hi></ref> As for the Chatterton, there are
clues
enough: the Newberry copy shows a special signature 'c4' on the
Advertisement leaf, an irregular stub behind&mdash;and indentations
that do not match those of halfsheet c.</p>
<p>Books that have been badly bound or rebound often exhibit no
stubs. Recently in examining a copy of a book of rates of the
custom house, <hi rend="italic">The Rates of Merchandizes</hi> (1642) 4&deg;,
printed on a mixture of pillar and pot papers, I came upon a
complete pillar mark in the inner fold D2.3&mdash;and also half a pot
(the lower half) in leaf D1. Obviously this leaf is an intruder.
D1<hi rend="super">v</hi>, indeed, has one more line of type than
D2<hi rend="super">r</hi>, and the two
pages are a little out of alinement; but the half-watermark is
certain evidence, along with a mismatch of the grooves in leaf and
sheet. The copy, belonging to the University of Chicago, has at
some time been carelessly trimmed (with damage to marginalia in an
early hand), and barbarously stabbed and stapled&mdash;so that any stub
that may exist cannot possibly show.
<ref target="f006.12.15" n="15"><hi rend="super">15</hi></ref> Another

<pb n="006.188"/>

cancel turns up in sheet I; and this time the indentation evidence
resolves an ambiguity. Here the outer fold shows no mark, but I2
has the crescent top of a Norman pot and I3 the grape top of a
Norman pillar mark.<ref target="f006.12.16" n="16"><hi rend="super">16</hi></ref> Obviously one

of these leaves of the inner fold is a cancel; but which? The two
headlines of I2 furnish more than a clue, as they read <hi rend="italic">"Rates
Outwards."</hi> (with a capital O) instead of <hi rend="italic">"Rates
outwards."</hi> as on other pages of this section (I1-L1).
<ref target="f006.12.17" n="17"><hi rend="super">17</hi></ref> Along with them the indentations
provide certainty: inasmuch as I1, I2, and I3 all have verso
indentations (in this copy), I2 is clearly the cancel.</p>
<p>The most instructive and amusing group of cancels that I have
encountered occur in a late seventeenth-century volume of Irish
economics: Richard Lawrence, <hi rend="italic">The Interest of Ireland in Its
Trade and Wealth Stated</hi> (Dublin: Jos. Ray . . . 1682)
8&deg;.<ref target="f006.12.18" n="18"><hi rend="super">18</hi></ref> It is printed partly on
foolscap, partly on shield paper. The apparent collation is
*-**<hi rend="super">8</hi> &tgr;-3&tgr;<hi rend="super">8</hi> A-F<hi rend="super">8</hi>
G<hi rend="super">6</hi> H<hi rend="super">6</hi> 2A-2F<hi rend="super">8</hi>
(&mdash;2F8)
2f<hi rend="super">8</hi>
2g<hi rend="super">2</hi> 2G-2R<hi rend="super">8</hi>; but matters are not that
simple. At A8<hi rend="super">v</hi> the
book has one of the most delightful errata pages that I have seen.
It informs the reader that, due to the author's absence from town
and the mislaying of some papers, certain regrettable mistakes have
occurred in the printing, and gatherings ff and gg have now been
added, without pagination. Then, after a few lines of errata, comes
this revealing </p>

<q>
<p><hi rend="italic">Advertisement to the Binder</hi>.</p>
<p>At the end of ** in the Epi&longs;tle Dedicatory there wants the
Direction, <hi rend="italic">viz. Plebeius,</hi> gg the Quarter &longs;heet in G Part

of Mm to be the fir&longs;t of Ee, Nn fol. 195, 196, and 199, 200. to
be cancelled; Oo fol. 213, 214, 217, 218, 221, 222. to be
cancelled; the &longs;aid leaves of Nn and Oo being reprinted.</p>
</q>

<p>This does not merely show how such terms as 'direction', 'quarter
sheet', and 'cancelled' were used; it shows how the printer handled
his cancel problems. Most interesting is the transference of the
last two leaves of G to a point 122 pages later, and of 2M8 to a
point 144 pages earlier, with implications as to the order of
printing and the number of presses, worth looking into. It was the
Newberry copy that I held in my hand, and I could check the manner
in which the binder had done his assigned work. There are no stubs.
As sig. G has six leaves and its cutoff 2g the remaining two, which
would presumably be printed as the innermost or outermost

<pb n="006.189"/>

fold, the binder may have used the same identical sheet for both
gatherings, for the indentations of G are outer and those of 2g are
inner.<ref target="f006.12.19" n="19"><hi rend="super">19</hi></ref> At 2E1 the binder has
<hi rend="italic">not</hi> done his work, for the cancellandum remains with a slash

down two-thirds of its length, and [2M8] also holds its original
place. The latter comes startlingly upon the eye, suddenly
intruding lists of Irish lords divided into columns of Protestants
and Papists between pages of regular prose. The leaf is paged 65-66
and bears the signature 'Ee'. Both sheets, 2E and 2M, show
<hi rend="italic">outer</hi> indentations; and that is most interesting for the
present enquiry. For, obviously, if, in this particular copy, the
binder (any binder) were to move the new Ee to the position of the
slashed Ee, the grooves of the cancel would not match those of the
pseudo-conjugate, though (or because) the two sheets as printed
were grooved on the same side. Thus, if the cancellation had been
carried through, the
bibliographer might have known the fact, in the absence of a stub,
by noting the indentations. In this instance he might have checked
the substitution by observing the watermarks; but this is not easy
in octavos. The prevailing mark in the sheets affected by the
cancels is a crowned shield containing six fleurs-de-lis, a type of
mark not shown in Heawood and not easy to make out here.
<ref target="f006.12.20" n="20"><hi rend="super">20</hi></ref> The paper is probably Morlaix fine

crown. Now, commonly in octavos using French paper the watermark
shows mainly (or at least partly) in the outer leaves of the sheet
as printed, that is in 1:4 or 2:3.<ref target="f006.12.21" n="21"><hi rend="super">21</hi></ref>
But the shield marks in the Lawrence volume are closer to the
center and show altogether in the inside fold-downs 5:8 and 6:7. As
it happens, the copy under analysis has the lower part of a shield
in the cancellans 'Ee' (2M8), with no mark possible in the
cancellandum. Thus, for one who has acquainted himself with the
unusual watermark
situation, the presence of the mark in the cancel (supposing the
cancellation had been carried through) would sufficiently prove the
substitution; but clearly the indentation evidence is just as
telling, while simple and unconfusing.</p>
<pb n="006.190"/>

<p>The five cancels advertised as in 2N and 2O are of more ordinary
import. "The said leaves . . . being reprinted" would fit&mdash;four of
them&mdash;into a single forme, print-and-turn, with the fifth using
2F8 or one of the missing leaves of sheet H; but the printer does
not say this. In the copy at hand leaf 2N2 (pp. 195-196) matches
the (outer) groove-pattern of the sheet, in an unwatermarked part
of the sheet, and thus does not show whether it is cancellandum or
cancellans. Leaf 2N4 (pp. 199-200) does <hi rend="italic">not</hi> match, as it has
recto grooves. It also shows the lower half of a shield within a
leaf which normally has none; and it precedes a leaf, 2N5, which
has the lower half of a shield, legitimately. In gathering 2O [Oo],
also with an outer groove-pattern, 2O3 (pp. 213-214) matches, but
the type-page is misalined. Leaf 2O5 (pp. 217-218) fails to match,
and shows the lower part of a shield, as does the following leaf,
2O6. Finally, leaf 2O7 (pp. 221-222) has matching grooves&mdash;but
poor alinement. Interestingly enough, it shows the upper part of a
shield which seems to have replaced an upper part in the
cancellandum&mdash;<hi rend="italic">from the companion mould</hi>. As the two

moulds
are not easy to distinguish, at least in an octavo, one would
prefer groove evidence or stub evidence were it present, the
misalinement not being in itself quite convincing. Comparison with
other copies may relieve this analysis of one or two ambiguities,
and throw further light on the printing history of the book; but
the volume is not common.<ref target="f006.12.22" n="22"><hi rend="super">22</hi></ref> The
study of one copy has served to emphasize the relative simplicity
of indentation evidence over some other kinds.</p>
<p>The most familiar cancel-position is the title-page. Many titles
(in publishing history) have been second guesses, on the part of
author, printer, or publisher. And various old titles have given
way to new, when the publishing situation changed or a need was
felt to pass off an old edition as new. Sir Walter Greg has
recorded a number of instances among seventeenth-century
play-quartos;<ref target="f006.12.23" n="23"><hi rend="super">23</hi></ref> and Fredson Bowers
will record a good many more in his continuation of Greg's
<hi rend="italic">Bibliography</hi>.<ref target="f006.12.24" n="24"><hi rend="super">24</hi></ref> Yet it
is
possible that an occasional title-cancel has escaped notice&mdash;and
that, indeed, reissues have been accepted as original editions.</p>
<p>Thus it is wise (over the years) to watch the indentations in
titles and their apparently conjugate leaves. Unfortunately, many
of the conjugates

<pb n="006.191"/>

were blanks preceding the title, and now the title is a single leaf
pasted to the dedication or first page of text. But wherever (as
commonly) the title was the first leaf of a whole sheet or
halfsheet, indentations may in time bring to light cancels and the
manipulations of booksellers. And this despite the fact that titles
may have become soiled and the sides of the paper difficult to
distinguish. I have made no important discoveries myself, but some
one else may.<ref target="f006.12.25" n="25"><hi rend="super">25</hi></ref></p>
<p>Some cancels of course are not single leaves. They may be entire
sheets. Or they may be made up of a single fold, a pair of
conjugate leaves. At times such a fold replaces two similar leaves,
and at other times only one. It may be difficult, though, to decide
just which leaves are the cancel.</p>
<p>An edifying example occurs in John Hopkins' <hi rend="italic">Milton's
Paradise
Lost Imitated in Rhyme</hi> (1699) 8&deg; in fours. Sheet B contains
a parody of Book IV, on the love-life of Adam and Eve, written in
heroic couplets and <hi rend="italic">doubles entendres</hi>. Perchance the
poetaster had an afterthought, for the gathering is made up of five
leaves and a stub, after this order: 'B' 'B2', unsigned, stub,
'B3', unsigned. (&dollar;3 is not ordinarily signed.) The pagination
proceeds regularly up to 10; then 9 and 10 are repeated on C1. One
suspects that 'B3' and the following leaf are a cancel replacing
the excised final leaf of an octavo halfsheet, represented now by
the unattached stub. The paper is probably English, of poor
quality, and apparently unwatermarked.
<ref target="f006.12.26" n="26"><hi rend="super">26</hi></ref> The indentations are not easy to
see,
for the mould-maker has used the same thin wire for both laid lines
and chains. Still, they can be made out, and they show that the
grooves on 'B3' and [B5] match. In the
University of Chicago copy both [B3] and 'B3' have verso
indentations. Thus the ambiguity is dispelled, and one may describe
the gathering as B<hi rend="super">4</hi> (&mdash;B4 + 'B3'.[B5]).</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, the two-leaf cancel replaces <hi rend="italic">two</hi>
original leaves, several instructive situations arise. The simplest
occurs in the replacement of the inner fold of a quarto sheet,
where the continuity of the matter may have made the double cancel
both "necessary" and feasible. This situation is illustrated in
Gray's <hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> (1775) 4&deg;, where the cancel at 2P2.3 may

<pb n="006.192"/>

be determined by a mismatch of its grooves with those of the outer
fold. In instances of this sort, however, it may be necessary to
examine a number of copies to learn which of the two folds
<hi rend="italic">is</hi> the cancel.<ref target="f006.12.27" n="27"><hi rend="super">27</hi></ref></p>
<p>A more interesting situation arises when two conjugate leaves
replace two non-conjugates. Mr. Chapman cites an unusual instance
in his copy of Sir John Hawkins's <hi rend="italic">Life of Johnson</hi> (1787)
8&deg;, where a pair of conjugate leaves replace canceled F3 and
F5.<ref target="f006.12.28" n="28"><hi rend="super">28</hi></ref> As one of the two new leaves
<hi rend="italic">must</hi> have grooves that do not match the pattern of the
sheet, the groove evidence in this situation will prove infallible,
with the two unused stubs (if still present) calling attention to
the substitution.</p>
<p>A different sort of instance occurs in William Killigrew's
<hi rend="italic">Imperial Tragedy</hi> (1669) F&deg; in twos. It is printed on
pot-size paper with a small grape watermark, characteristic of the
Morlaix papermakers. When Fredson Bowers called my attention to the
possibility that M2 and N1 might be not merely a pair of cancels
but conjugate leaves, I examined the Newberry copy and found this
state of affairs:

It will be noticed that the watermarks seem to show nothing amiss:
it is the mispagination that makes M2 and N1 suspect. Actually, the
watermarks, were they unobscured by type, would tell the same tale
the indentations do; and the latter plainly show that, in this
copy, M1 and M2 are not conjugate, and N1 and N2 are not conjugate
either. As the stub appears to have a recto (vertical) groove, it
would seem to be the remains of canceled M2; but only the one stub
shows. It is obvious, at any rate, that M2 and N1 are cancels&mdash;and
probably conjugate. The spacing of the chains

<pb n="006.193"/>

suggests as much; but some prying finger (it seems) has cracked the
paper along the fold top and bottom. It will be necessary to
consider other copies to make certain.
<ref target="f006.12.028a" n="28a"><hi rend="super">28a</hi></ref> But the grooves, even vertical
grooves, have brought us close to the answer.</p>
<p>After this extended discussion of cancels it seems
supererogatory to discuss other types of substitution. For they may
be detected in much the same way&mdash;except that such signposts as
stubs and special signatures will not be present. If the inner fold
of a quarto gathering is drawn from a page-for-page resetting,
either the headlines or the indentations may call attention to the
mixture of settings. If the repairman or forger has cleverly used
paper with similar chainspaces, he will hardly have found paper
from the same individual moulds, and he may have missed matching
groove-sides. If the sophisticator manages to avoid leaving just
half a pot as unobtrusive evidence of how he made a defective
gathering "perfect",<ref target="f006.12.29" n="29"><hi rend="super">29</hi></ref> or even if he
has luckily brought together the top and base of a pot from the
same mould, he may yet have got the grooves wrong. The improver of
old books can scarcely get everything right, such are the
variations in paper and print.</p>
<p>Other uses for indentations will be found, such as will ease the
life of the descriptive bibliographer. Sometimes, say in a folio,
he needs to decide whether a portrait or engraved title is printed
on the same sheet as the printed title. Sometimes his question is
whether a blank leaf at the front (or back) of a book is a
contemporary endpaper or an integral part of the first (or last)
gathering. In a folio in fours, if a leaf has been deleted from a
certain gathering, he may be uncertain which two of the remaining
leaves are conjugate.<ref target="f006.12.30" n="30"><hi rend="super">30</hi></ref> When he is
dealing with a thin quarto in which he surmises that preliminary
and final halfsheets have been printed together, he will want to
say whether they are "outset", that is, wrapped around the other
sheets, or cut apart before gathering and binding. At least this
seems to be a question in dealing with eighteenth-century
books.<ref target="f006.12.31" n="31"><hi rend="super">31</hi></ref> In such situations, and
others that will arise,
where the question is partly or wholly

<pb n="006.194"/>

one of conjugacy, indentations should prove a useful tool towards
settling it.</p>
<p>One frequently notices, in descriptive bibliographies or in
dealers' catalogs, open questions or guarded statements that might
have been resolved by this device, particularly where several
copies may have been available for examination. A good and
sufficient example occurs in Sir Walter Greg's <hi rend="italic">Bibliography</hi>
in the description of John Fletcher's play <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Thomas</hi>
(1639) 4&deg;, which collates <hi rend="super">i</hi>1 A<hi rend="super">2</hi>
B-M<hi rend="super">4</hi> N1. Greg remarks:
"It is almost certain that the title is really printed on N2,
either detached or folded round the back (<hi rend="super">i</hi>1)."
<ref target="f006.12.32" n="32"><hi rend="super">32</hi></ref> In this and similar instances the
question whether the leaf was detached is one worth investigating,
as it involves a point of authenticity as well as one of
book-production. In the Newberry copy of <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Thomas</hi>
the
situation is clear. The grooves on <hi rend="super">i</hi>1<hi rend="super">v</hi> and
N1<hi rend="super">r</hi> match, and
the chain-extensions tally. And there is more significant evidence:
the title page has a very wide inner
margin, and the last leaf has almost none. Curiously, the
watermark, which shows in both leaves, is mainly in N1. It looks
less like a case of slippage than of off-center printing. But it
can hardly be doubted that, in this copy at least, <hi rend="super">i</hi>1 and N1
are
conjugate, and that the fold is "outset". It will be well to
examine other quartos in which a leaf appears to be wrapped around
the rest.<ref target="f006.12.33" n="33"><hi rend="super">33</hi></ref></p>
<p>Beyond these uses of indentations in problems of conjugacy lie
possible applications to further questions of method in the
printing-house. When the pressman opened out the quires, did he
make up the tokens and the whole heap with the fold or crease
consistently below? Moxon seems to imply that he did.
<ref target="f006.12.34" n="34"><hi rend="super">34</hi></ref> At what date (if ever) did he sort
out
sheets of fine paper so that the title page might be printed on the
"right" side of the sheet? In printing halfsheets together, in
"twin" imposition, was it the custom to print rectos beside rectos
and versos beside versos? Early nineteenth-century printers'
manuals seem to indicate that the contrary method was used.
<ref target="f006.12.35" n="35"><hi rend="super">35</hi></ref> That procedure would be necessary
for
outsets; but when were halfsheet outsets first employed? Was there
a paper advantage (as well as a saving of type) for those
eighteenth-century printers who favored halfsheet octavo and
duodecimo? When the print-and-turn method
was used, be it noted, the presses produced equal numbers of
halfsheets grooved on inner and outer sides; and certainly at such
times the printer was expressing

<pb n="006.195"/>

no preference for the right side or the wrong. Such matters may be
reserved for further study.</p>
<p>In the meantime bibliographers will test indentations as a tool
for settling problems of conjugacy.</p>

difference between the two sides." <hi rend="italic">Introduction to

Labarre, p. 227. That is, the quires are folded so that the grooves
are outside the fold. But this rule may not have held general
acceptance before the period of the machine. It is unlikely that
any unopened reams of old paper exist, whose quires might serve as
evidence. Yet more than occasionally a seventeenth-century book
shows such a sequence of grooves in its outer formes (say) as to
suggest the agreement is no accident; though other volumes show no
consistency from sheet to sheet or within several copies of the

<note id="f006.12.04" place="foot" n="4"><seg type="note-symbol"><hi rend="super">4</hi></seg><p>In the sixteenth century the paper used in
English books frequently has the initials of the papermaker reading
normally from the unindented side (the inscription having read from
left to right on the mould); whereas often in the seventeenth
century a pair of moulds are so made that in one the inscription
reads correctly from the unindented side, and in the other from the
indented side (the letters or words having been reversed on the
mould). See Allan H. Stevenson, "Watermarks Are Twins",
<hi rend="italic">SB,</hi>

an orderly manner, and that homogeneity was possible or probable if
the sheets and quires had been packed consistently at the mill.
"Then taking the first Quire of the <hi rend="italic">Heap</hi> . . ., he lays the
Quire down upon the Waste Sheet, so, as that the back of the Quire

tract at the Newberry, <hi rend="italic">The Necessity of Parliaments . . . By a
True Protestant, and English Man</hi> (1689), from the fore-edge of
the title page of which an exceedingly long-nosed fool looks
mockingly upon the twentieth century. The title, if not certainly
a cancel, is at least a leaf printed separately. Similarly, a
University of Chicago octavo, Horace's <hi rend="italic">Odes, Satyres, and
Epistles</hi> (1684), printed on Norman demy
(<hi rend="italic">carr&eacute;</hi>), has
a title page with a piece of the Arms of France &amp; Navarre in its

that this copy contains a few alterations of speeches and

<name type="title">A Handlist of the Writings in Book Form
(1902-1953) of
Walter de la Mare</name>
<lb/><hi rend="italic">compiled by</hi><lb/> <name type="author">Leonard
Clark</name>
</head>

<div2 type="section"><head></head>
<p>It seems extraordinary that in spite of the fact that Walter de
la Mare has been writing and publishing books for over fifty years,
no complete handlist of his work exists. No writer is better known,
or better loved, in the English speaking world. His poems, tales,
and critical articles have appeared in many journals, in many
collections, and in many languages. Much has been written and
broadcast about his particular contribution to letters and, for the
past seven years, he has been one of the most "collected" of all
English authors. He is now eighty years old, and it is therefore
time that a permanent record was made of what he has written in
book form. It will be for others, and at a later date, to prepare
a definitive bibliography, but while its subject is still alive,
this particular honour should be paid him. This does not suggest
that Walter de la Mare is waiting sadly on the shores of Styx for
a boat to row him over. Indeed, he continues to write in all the
full power of
his wisdom and maturity, and the collector must still keep his eyes
open for the occasional poem and short story. During this very year
he plans to publish two new books.</p>
<p>The last bibliography of any consequence was published in the
now defunct <hi rend="italic">London Mercury</hi> in its two issues for March and

April, 1927. This was compiled by Miss Gwendolen Murphy, and though
it had a number of minor inaccuracies, it was, at least, in the
nature of a halfway stage. Previously, Mr. Henry Danielson had
contributed a bibliography to <hi rend="italic">The Bookman's Journal</hi> in its
first series of "Bibliographies of Modern Authors." This was in
1921. But many years have elapsed since Mr. Danielson and Miss
Murphy performed their valuable tasks. The position at present is
that very few scholars, writers, librarians, booksellers and
collectors are aware of <hi rend="italic">all</hi> that Walter de la Mare has
written in book form. Further, it could hardly be expected that
Walter de la Mare himself should remember the name and birthday of
every child he has produced. The present

<pb n="006.198"/>

Handlist, in fact, has served to freshen his own memory and, once
freshened, it was able to produce other information.</p>
<p>This Handlist is largely based on the collection of the compiler
though, obviously, much information has been obtained from other
sources. So many have been ready to help, and on both sides of the
Atlantic. The List does not mention a publication on Sugar, which
was the work of Walter de la Mare in 1916, when he was employed for
a short while by the Ministry of Food. Although it is known that
this paper was written, the compiler has seen no copy of it.
Neither was it felt fitting, at this stage, with one or two
exceptions, to include periodicals in the List, but when a complete
bibliography comes to be written, its compiler must not forget
Walter de la Mare's contribution to <hi rend="italic">The Choristers' Journal</hi>
in 1889, when he was still a boy at St. Paul's Cathedral School,
nor his very early stories in <hi rend="italic">The Sketch</hi> (after 1895) and
<hi rend="italic">The Cornhill</hi> (1896-1897). The files of <hi rend="italic">The Saturday
Westminster, The Bookman,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Times Literary
Supplement</hi> from 1908
onwards will also have to be thoroughly scoured. Poems set to
music, and pieces from Walter de la Mare's books reprinted in other
books have also been excluded. Foreign editions are not mentioned,
except when they are first editions or editions seriously amended.
However, it should be noted that many of his books have been
published in French, German, Danish, Spanish, Italian, Swedish, and
Japanese.</p>
<p>It is realised that this Handlist is a modest beginning, but it
chief merit lies in the fact that, to the best knowledge of its
compiler, it is unique.</p>

<name type="title">Identification of Contributors to the <hi rend="italic">North
American
Review</hi> under Lowell</name>
<lb/><hi rend="italic">by</hi><lb/> <name type="author">F. DeWolfe
Miller</name>
</head>

<div2 type="section"><head></head>
<p>There appears below a complementary index to the <hi rend="italic">North
American Review,</hi> 1864-1872, which every researcher working with

the <hi rend="italic">Review</hi> for that period should consult. It corrects
errors which appear in Cushing's index, gives additional
information, and makes readily available much material which is
difficult to locate in Cushing.</p>
<p>If for no other reason than for the exceptional young talent
which practiced in its pages, the <hi rend="italic">North American Review</hi>
might be considered to have enjoyed the most important period in
its history during the editorship of Lowell from January, 1864,
through the April, 1872, issue. For the first four years of that
period Charles Eliot Norton was the co-editor and in effect the
editor, while Lowell, co-editor in name, was in practice a heavy
contributor whose name was apparently intended to add prestige.
This arrangement, begun a year before the Civil War was over,
lasted on through the reconstruction period to 1868, when Norton
resigned and Lowell remained the lone editor until he went abroad
in the summer of 1872. Perhaps no other magazine of the century
could boast of having men like Henry Adams and his brother, Charles
Francis, Henry and William James, John Fiske and Willian Dean
Howells as regular contributors, not to mention the work of Lowell,
Norton, Emerson, and
James Parton.</p>
<p>Until 1868 all contributions went unsigned. After that time the
shorter "critical notices" (we would today call most of them
reviews) continued to appear anonymously, but Lowell abandoned the
long-standing custom of calling the articles reviews, and with a
few exceptions the articles were signed.</p>
<p>When William Cushing, a Harvard librarian, prepared his
<hi rend="italic">Index
to the North American Review</hi> in 1878 he had to determine the
authorship of anonymous articles published over a period of more
than sixty years.

<pb n="006.220"/>

In his preface he expressed a modest confidence that his work
achieved a satisfactory degree of reliability. When we consider the
conditions under which the <hi rend="italic">Review</hi> was edited and the
resultant difficulties for an indexer, we can agree that his work
is quite valuable to history and to the history of literature.
There are omissions, however, and inaccuracies and contradictions
within the index, which because of the importance of the
Norton-Lowell period, are examined in detail here.</p>
<p>Among the various biographers, editors, and bibliographers whose
work has led them into the <hi rend="italic">North American</hi> before 1878 we
find, even in the case of some of the most recent, varying skills
in handling the index. I have previously pointed out the fact that
Lowell scholars have for fifty years overlooked a significant body
of his criticism which was indexed by Cushing.
<ref target="f006.14.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref> Several men who could have used
the
index to advantage have overlooked it entirely, others have used it
gingerly, but so far as I have discovered only one or two men have
tapped the full resources of Cushing's work. Because of the
peculiar organization of the index, researchers who do wish to be
sure they have found everything it can give them have to check
individually every item in the index, which has duplicate and many
triplicate entries, and this has to be done with a file of the
<hi rend="italic">Review</hi> at hand. To obtain definitive results they would have
had to do what I have done
in preparation of the complementary index below&mdash;re-index the
period in which they are working.</p>
<p>Instead of consolidating his entries as in the card catalogue of
a library, Cushing awkwardly divided his index into a subject
section and an author section, the latter itself containing a
subsection. Under the subject index (which I refer to below as
Cushing-S) there are single or multiple entries of what in
Cushing's sometimes curious opinion were the more important
subjects. These entries give the subject, author, and reference to
volume and first page. In the main part of the author index
(designated here Cushing-A) the contributions of each writer are
listed by title, volume, and first page. In the case of some of the
more frequent contributors, there are subsections under the
contributors' names (designated here Cushing-C), listing by
issue&mdash;not volume&mdash;number and critical notice number certain
of
the critical notices. Cushing's sorting of items to go into
Cushing-A and -C is quite arbitrary, as is also his decision to
include or omit any given item under a subject
heading in Cushing-S. The omission of numerous items from
Cushing-S, which are nevertheless included in Cushing-A or -C,
makes it necessary for the researcher who wishes to identify the
author of an article omitted in Cushing-S to check each item in
Cushing -A and -C until he finds his title. Omissions from
Cushing-A

<pb n="006.221"/>

and -C appear to be accidental rather than deliberate, for they
occur in about the same proportion with other mistakes. But since
they do occur, the researcher would heretofore have had to check
each item in Cushing-S to be sure that his work was complete.</p>
<p>There are other sources of information, two of them unpublished,
which serve to confirm, question or complement the information
contained in Cushing's index. The Harvard College Library owns a
memorandum book (referred to below as NorMemo) which Norton
maintained during his editorship. He used one sheet to make out a
working plan for the next issue of the <hi rend="italic">Review,</hi> and the
following sheet for a final record of the contents of the finished
issue. He was not regular in his entries and a final table of
contents appears for eight issues only, or about half the number
edited by him. The records are quite neat and clear. Usually the
table contains the roman and arabic numerals under which the items
were published, a short title, the author, and the amount of pay.
When this is the case Norton must be taken as the authority when he
conflicts with Cushing. Sometimes, however, Norton omits the title,
leaving only a number for the identification of the item. In such
instances it is
possible that he made an error by transposition in sequence. Thus
the critical notices in the October, 1864, issue are identified
only by number and his attributions of Notices 10, 11, and 12
disagree with Cushing and cannot be accepted as final. In one
issue&mdash;October, 1866&mdash;his table of contents is not in sequence.

He has grouped the critical notices written by each man,
identifying them by title and/or author of the book reviewed, and
has placed the amount paid the reviewer after his name. An
unprecedented six out of twenty-four of Cushing's attributions for
this issue differ from Norton's, whose record must be considered
authoritative.</p>
<p>Norton's record must take precedence over Cushing, even though
Cushing and a third source of information are found in agreement.
There is in the Harvard College Library a file of the <hi rend="italic">North
American Review</hi> (referred to hereafter as HCL) which has been
inscribed with the names of the contributors. For the period
1864-72 the inscriptions appear in at least four hands; nothing
seems to be known about the origin of any of the inscriptions
throughout the file. Except for the places where Cushing
contradicts himself, there is no such disagreement between Cushing
and HCL as there is between these two and Norton. Since Cushing and
HCL sometimes make the same mistake we may suspect that Cushing
used this file or that his assistants actually made the
inscriptions when compiling the index. However, there are many more
omissions in HCL than in Cushing, and HCL occasionally identifies
items (in inscriptions which were apparently made at the same time
with the others), which
Cushing leaves blank.</p>

<pb n="006.222"/>

<p>Cushing later issued a slender <hi rend="italic">Supplementary Index</hi>
covering the two-year period 1878-1880 and containing a correction
sheet for the previous index. In the complementary index given
below, the information from the three parts of Cushing's 1878
index, from his correction sheet, and from the marked copy at
Harvard has been consolidated with the notes in Norton's memorandum
book and with other but minor sources. An author or title entry is
included wherever it is necessary to make the information from
these various sources instantly available to the reader or
researcher.</p>
<p>This complementary index identifies the authors of eight
articles and notices not identified by Cushing; changes completely
the authorship of six; throws doubt on the authorship of twelve and
reports the conflicting evidence; clarifies the authorship of
seven; and assures the researcher that information about the
authorship of seven other items is not contained anywhere in the
sources outlined above. Under the authors' names it lists seven
articles which are attributed to them in Cushing-S but omitted in
Cushing-A and C, and it enables the reader to determine the authors
of 147 articles and reviews, or notices omitted entirely from
Cushing-S.</p>

<hi rend="italic">Ballad Book</hi> immediately following (pp. 316-318), are
ascribed to C. E. Norton in Cushing-C and HCL. However, Norton in
his memorandum lists the two reviews as by "G. N.," who received &dollar;7
for them. After the first issue edited by him, Norton never lists
the amount of money received by himself or by Lowell. These two
reviews are the only others ever marked by initials, from which
fact we conclude that they stand for somebody quite familiar to
him. Grace Norton, his sister, was an intellectual intimate of both
Norton and Lowell

<item>FROTHINGHAM'S PHILOSOPHY AS ABSOLUTE SCIENCE,
reviewed by C.
E. Norton, XCIX (Oct. 1864), 622-624. [There is considerable
confusion about the authorship of Critical Notices 10 (this
review), 11, and 12. NorMemo cannot be accepted as absolute
authority, since Norton in his notes on this issue designates the
notices by number only. As he does not give the title, there is no
assurance that he did not confuse the numbers. This review of a
book by Ephraim Langdon Frothingham and Arthur Lincoln Frothingham
is attributed to Octavius Brooks Frothingham in Cushing-A and HCL,
but to Norton in Cushing-S and in NorMemo. If Octavius Brooks was
a brother of the authors &mdash;I cannot clearly establish that he
was&mdash;it is unlikely that the book would have been assigned to him
for review. Critical Notice 11 ("Tuckerman's <hi rend="italic">America</hi>. . .
.") is attributed to Norton in Cushing-S and NorMemo. But Cushing-C
and HCL attribute it to Lowell, and Cooke lists it in his Lowell
bibliography. An
allusion to a trip to Germany made in the review would have at that
date been possible for Lowell but not for Norton. Critical Notice
12 ("Tennyson's <hi rend="italic">Enoch Arden"</hi>) is attributed to Lowell in
Cushing-C, HCL, and Cooke's bibliography, but in NorMemo it is
attributed to O. B. Frothingham. Internal evidence points strongly
toward Lowell and away from Frothingham. Norton almost surely errs
on this and the preceding item.]</item>

<item>GAGE'S MODERN HISTORICAL ATLAS, CVIII, (April 1869),
661-663.
[Cushing-S and -A give William Francis Allen as the author of this

285-287, and of "Seeley's <hi rend="italic">Livy,</hi>" CXIV (April 1872),
419-426.
But HCL has an inscription "W. F. Allen," followed by an "X" after
each of the three reviews. The authority of the "X" as an
indication that the attribution is

<pb n="006.225"/>

wrong is highly questionable. Cushing in 1880 published
<hi rend="italic">Supplementary Index</hi> . . . , which contained a correction
sheet for the 1878 index. The corrections seem to have been made by
the contributors themselves (there being several corrections for
some names, and none at all for other names in connection with
which some errors had been made). As there were two deletions and
one addition under Allen's list, it should be accurate as
corrected, and all three of these reviews are apparently by
him.]</item>

Norton and Lowell prepared this history and statement. In a work
sheet for this issue Norton listed, by number only, Lowell's name

Lowell was the author of only one other article in the issue as

<name type="title">The British Museum's Copy of a Rare
Book From
Brescia: A
Problem in Dating.</name>
<lb/><hi rend="italic">by</hi><lb/> <name type="author">D. E. Rhodes</name>
</head>

<div2 type="section"><head></head>
<p>Giordano Ruffo, a Calabrian of the thirteenth century, who
describes himself as 'cavaliere' to the Emperor Frederick II, wrote
in Latin a treatise on the care of horses which was many times
printed in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. It became the
standard work of reference in its field, and more than one Italian
translation was made. One of these, by Frate Gabriele Bruno,
entitled "Arte de cognoscere la natura d' cauael" was first printed
by Petrus de Quarengiis at Venice, probably in 1492. The edition of
the same translation which is to be considered in the present note
came from the press of Thomas Ferrandus at Brescia, who is
represented in the British Museum's fifteenth century collection by
not more than three books. His known dates as a printer (or
possibly as a publisher only) are from 1473 to 1493, although
evidence exists to prove that he lived on into the following
century.</p>
<p>The edition which Ferrandus produced of Ruffo's book on horses
seems to have become singularly rare; there is a copy in the
British Museum, but I have failed to trace one elsewhere in the
British Isles, and none at all in Italy. The Museum copy,
unfortunately, has had its date erased and a totally false one
substituted in ink. This erroneous date, 1611, was long ago
accepted by the catalogue, and it is now my purpose to piece
together the scanty threads of evidence provided by the book itself
in order to date it more accurately. As yet, I have not found the
edition catalogued by any other major library. The book is printed
in a plain roman type, which can be identified with Ferrandus's
early 83R, such as appears in a Ludovico de Puppio of 1493, a copy
of which is in the Marciana Library at Venice. It is however
impossible to place the Museum's edition of Ruffo in the last
decade of the fifteenth century (tempting as it is to try to do so)
for the following simple reason: there
is not enough space left in the place where the true date has been
erased for the requisite number of capital Roman letters to form a
date preceding 1500. The colophon reads thus: "Fato stampare per
messere Tomaso Ferante in citadella uechia // apresso al conte
Piero da Gambara nela cita de Bressa : nel anno // del Signore.
M[DC.XI] del mese de Augusto." Of this date, the 'M' is printed,
while the 'DC.XI' are in ink. There seems to be no good reason why
the forger should have wished to substitute a date which is clearly
at least a hundred years too late for the book in question.</p>
<p>Thus for reasons of space it seems necessary at once to assign
the book to the early years of the sixteenth century. There is
enough corroborative evidence respecting both the publisher and
Count Pietro Gambara to make this hypothesis more than possible.
Luigi Lechi, the historian of Brescian printing, has shown that
Tomaso Ferrando, the date of whose birth is unknown, after
publishing several books between 1473 and 1493, was still alive but
in penurious circumstances

<pb n="006.232"/>

in 1498.<ref target="f006.15.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref> More than that, he was
still in Brescia in the early years of the new century, as is seen
from a letter which he wrote to the celebrated humanist Marino
Becichemo, a Dalmatian from Scutari who had been educated in
Brescia and who returned there to teach. The letter in question is
printed in Becichemo's book entitled <hi rend="italic">Marini Becichemi Scodrensis
Elegans ac docta in C. Plinium Praelectio</hi>, Paris, 1519, pt. 1,
p. xc : 'Sequitur epistola Thomae Ferandi Veterani Grammatici . .
.'</p>
<p>Now Becichemo, who was born in 1468, after studying in Brescia
as a youth, returned to Dalmatia, and afterwards lived in Venice,
where he achieved such a reputation as a humanist teacher that his
services were invited by many Italian towns. It was not until 1502
that he returned to Brescia, and therefore Ferrandus probably wrote
to him in 1503 or 1504 the letter to which we have already
referred.<ref target="f006.15.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref></p>
<p>Count Pietro Gambara's dates are not known for certain, but
several facts concerning his life are available. In 1473 he shared
with his brothers the inheritance of his father's property and a
house in Brescia. In 1486 he gave a dowry of 6,000 ducats to his
daughter Paola, who was later canonised. Pietro married Taddea, a
daughter of the celebrated family of Martinengo, who is said to
have been still alive in the sack of Brescia in 1512. In 1504, she
had become <hi rend="italic">tutrice</hi> (governess or guardian) to her two sons
Federico and Lodovico.<ref target="f006.15.03" n="3"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref> The date
of
her husband's death cannot be ascertained, but the inference is
that he was dead when his wife took upon herself full
responsibility for maintaining her sons.</p>
<p>The result of adding together the above shreds of evidence is
that the most suitable date which can be ascribed to Ferrandus's
edition of Giordano Ruffo's book is at the latest 1504. This date,
expressed in Roman fashion&mdash;MDIIII&mdash; would also contain the

correct number of letters to account for the space caused by the
man who so infuriatingly scratched out the true printed date in
what now appears to be the last surviving copy in a public library
(at least in Europe) of this particular edition. The present writer
hopes that the publication of this note will lead to the location
of a perfect copy, which will then give us further proof of the
curiously sporadic output of Thomas Ferrandus of Brescia.</p>

seventeenth-century Dublin books there were for him, apart from the
recording of readily recognizable

<pb n="006.233"/>

Dublin imprints, two problems: those of identifying books printed
there with false imprints on the one hand, or, on the other,
without any place of publication at all. A half century later, we
as bibliographers, with a somewhat more sophisticated approach to
such a subject, might do well to reconsider the ground
<ref target="f006.16.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref> so amply surveyed by Dix himself,

profiting from perceptions heightened by the work of men like Henry
Bradshaw.</p>
</div2>

<div2 type="section" n="2"><head></head>
<p>In his conviction that numerous books had probably been printed
in Dublin which bore false imprints, such as Louvain, Paris, or St.
Omer, Dix assumed that the Catholics in Ireland surreptitiously
printed books for their own use, as was done elsewhere. Curiously
enough, experience has not supported that prediction, at least to
the degree Dix envisaged. Yet he was not entirely mistaken, since
there are at least three works of the seventeenth century which do
bear false imprints.</p>
<p>Of these, two are indeed Catholic works, albeit Catholic works
with a difference. Thus Thomas Harold's <hi rend="italic">Narratio facti, jurisque
disquisitio, in lite jam vertente inter Rdos Adm P. P. Franciscum
Copingerum, et P. Geanor</hi> bears for imprint "Parisiis, Permissu
et jussu Superioris." A mandate to print on the verso of the
title-page, signed by Copinger "in loco nostri Refugy [sic] 18 May
[sic] 1670" provides a date not long after which the book was
probably printed, while the misreading of what was intended to be
"ij" as "y" in "Refugy" and "May" points to an English-speaking
type-setter.<ref target="f006.16.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref></p>
<p>Typographically the <hi rend="italic">Narratio</hi> may confidently be
ascribed
to the King's Printing-House in Dublin, in the year 1670 in the
hands of Benjamin Tooke. For on leaves [A]2<hi rend="super">r</hi> and
A2-2<hi rend="super">r</hi> (i.e.,
the recto of the second leaf of a gathering the first leaf of which
is signed A2) is used a headpiece frequently employed by the shop,
as for instance on p. 1 of Dudley Loftus's <hi rend="italic">The Case of Ware and
Sherley</hi> (1669) and on leaf [A]2<hi rend="super">r</hi> of Benjamin
Parry's <hi rend="italic">More
than Conqueror</hi> (1673). Also used in the <hi rend="italic">Narratio</hi> are
two
decorative initials "I" and "C" of a sort less common, yet found on
pp. 58 and 280, respectively, of John Stearne's <hi rend="italic">De electione</hi>
of 1662, while other letters from the same alphabet are found
elsewhere.</p>
<p>A companion piece to this <hi rend="italic">Narratio</hi> appears to have
completely escaped recognition, although it too is by Harold, and
also bears the approbation of Fr. Copinger, dated 1670. As with the
<hi rend="italic">Narratio,</hi> in this work, the <hi rend="italic">Tractatus de recursu ad
protectionem principium in necessitate, contra violentiam
clericorum,</hi> the imprint is given as "Parisiis, Permissu &amp;
Jussu Superioris." In fact, although no positive evidence has been
found that the <hi rend="italic">Tractatus</hi> was actually published

<pb n="006.234"/>

along with the <hi rend="italic">Narratio,</hi> the sheets, apart from the first
gathering signed A, are signed K-N, in continuation of the
signatures used in the <hi rend="italic">Narratio,</hi> while pp. 9-26 of the
<hi rend="italic">Tractatus</hi> are misnumbered 73-90, again a continuation of the

paging of the <hi rend="italic">Narratio</hi>. However, the sequence does not
provide for the titleleaf nor for dedicatory leaves to Charles II
(present in the Bodleian copy but not in the Grenville copy at the
British Museum): one may hazard the hypothesis that the
<hi rend="italic">Tractatus</hi> was planned to be printed along with the
<hi rend="italic">Narratio,</hi> but that while it was being set up in type, the
decision was made to publish it as a separate work.</p>
<p>Typographically the two pieces are obviously from the same shop,
with a decorative initial on the dedication leaf in the same series
as the "C" and "I" of the <hi rend="italic">Narratio;</hi> and that they are
closely related is apparent.</p>
<p>The interest of these two items is not confined to theology, for
they prove to be of considerable Irish significance, again
supporting the probability of Dublin printing. The controversy
between the Franciscan Fathers Copinger and Geanor sprang out of
the religious and political situation in Ireland following upon the
return of Charles II. It will be recalled that while a group of the
regular Catholic clergy, largely Franciscan, headed by Fr. Peter
Walsh, was prepared to accept the political authority of Charles
II, the secular clergy, headed by Bishop O'Reilly, were strongly
opposed to the Remonstrance drawn up in 1662 by Walsh, embodying
his views. Copinger and Harold, both Franciscans, had signed the
Remonstrance. As a consequence, Fr. Copinger was replaced by Fr.
Geanor as Provincial Vicar of the Franciscans in Munster, on orders
from Rome. It is against Copinger's replacement that Harold is here
writing, as a rear guard action in the efforts of the Remonstrants
to achieve
reconciliation between Catholics in Ireland and the Crown. It was
an unsuccessful action, for in the month of May, 1670, Copinger and
Harold were silenced by a Chapter General of their order, meeting
in Valladolid, and Harold is subsequently found in Brussels under
discipline.</p>
<p>While it is somewhat surprising to find that these works written
by a Roman Catholic should be printed by the King's Printer in
Dublin, it ought to be noted that they were done for a section of
the Catholic clergy most favorable to the government. This may well
have represented an official governmental policy, to split the
Catholics by setting the secular and regular clergy at variance
among themselves.</p>
</div2>

<div2 type="section" n="3"><head></head>
<p>It is possibly to romance rather than religion that we are
indebted for another false imprint on a Dublin-printed book, <hi rend="italic">The
Vindication of an Injured Lady, Written by the Lady Francesca Maria
Lucretia Plunkett, One of the Ladies of the Privy Chamber to the
Queen-Mother of England,</hi> the imprint of which is given as
"London, Printed in the Year, M.DC.LXVII." Copies are to be found
at the Bodleian and at Trinity College, Dublin. Ostensibly a
defense by Lady Plunkett of her moral character, the work is not
quite what it appears to be. According to Walter Harris's account
of Dudley Loftus in his edition of Sir James Ware's <hi rend="italic">The Writers
of Ireland,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Vindication</hi> is from the pen of

<pb n="006.235"/>

Loftus himself, writing on behalf of Lady Plunkett. As Harris
remarks: "It was well known that he lived in too great Familiarity
with this Lady."</p>
<p>The attribution to Loftus is a plausible one. From what is known
of his character it is quite the sort of thing he would do. A
scholar with a knowledge of a score of languages, including
Armenian and Ethiopic, he was notorious also for his "levity" and
"want of good sense." If the Lady Plunkett existed at all&mdash;and I
have not been able to verify her actual existence&mdash;Loftus was
quite capable, as he has done here, of transforming her into a lady
of Italian birth, sprinkling her speech with Italian phrases, and
attaching her to the Queen Mother.</p>
<p>The use of a London imprint carries out this elaborate conceit,
but the <hi rend="italic">Vindication</hi> was undoubtedly printed in Dublin. This
conclusion is supported by the use of a decorative initial "T",
embodying a boy astride a swan, used by the King's Printing-House
and also found in Titus Oates's <hi rend="italic">A True Narrative of the Horrid
Plot</hi> printed by Benjamin Tooke and John Crook in 1679, and also
used elsewhere.</p>
</div2>

<div2 type="section" n="4"><head></head>
<p>It is with a companion piece to the <hi rend="italic">Vindication</hi> that we
may consider another problem in Irish printing: that of works
without a place of publication. For, bound with the Trinity,
Dublin, copy of the <hi rend="italic">Vindication</hi> is a <hi rend="italic">Lettera esortatoria

di mettere opera a fare sincera penitenza mandata alla Signora F.
M. L. P.</hi> [i.e., Lady Plunkett]. It bears for imprint simply
"Stampata M. DC. LXVII" and is signed at the end "D. L." Continuing
the conceit embodied in the <hi rend="italic">Vindication,</hi> the author of the
<hi rend="italic">Lettera</hi> purports to be Lady Plunkett's confessor, an Italian
priest, advising her in the misfortunes which have befallen her due
to her misdeeds and excommunication.</p>
<p>One's astonishment at so involved a device is somewhat mitigated
by the fact that in 1664 Loftus had seen fit to translate into
Italian the Duke of Ormonde's speech of 27 September 1662, which
was "Stampata in Dublino per Giov. Crooke, Stampatore Regio, e si
vendono appresso Sam. Dancer." What practical purpose such a
translation served in Dublin, other than possibly flattering
Ormonde or gratifying Loftus's linguistic vanity, one can only
wonder. But we are accordingly prepared for this <hi rend="italic">Lettera</hi>.
That it too was printed in Dublin need not be doubted: employed on
p. 3 is an ornamental "M" found in John Stearne's <hi rend="italic">Animi
Medula</hi> of 1658, and Jeremy Taylor's <hi rend="italic">Sermon . . . January
27,
1660,</hi> printed in 1661, both issued from the King's
Printing-House.</p>
<p>One is normally confronted, however, with less picturesque
examples of books produced without imprints in Ireland in the
seventeenth century. The period 1677-1685 saw the appearance of an
abnormal number of such pieces, centering on the Popish Plot, and
issued as merely "reprinted" in the appropriate year. It is
apparent that the fate of Sir Edmundbury Godfrey and the
accusations of Titus Oates evoked widespread interest in Ireland.
In meeting the demand for reprints of English publications, both
the Crook family and Joseph Ray may well have played a part in the
whipping up of an "Irish Popish Plot" which led to the sentencing
to death of Archbishop Oliver Plunket, whose innocence should have
been patent to all.</p>

<pb n="006.236"/>

<p>While a goodly number of such pieces on the Popish Plot bear at
least the statement "Dublin printed," a substantial number do not.
Their printers had sound reasons for not attaching their names to
these reprints. Their republication cannot have failed to give
affront to Catholics, and the pieces themselves are no credit to
their printers. Broadsides or quarto pamphlets, as a lot they
reveal even seventeenth-century printing at its very lowest. Old
and battered types and ornaments are used; italic and roman fonts
are indiscriminately mingled; while poor paper, ink, and presswork
complete the degradation. The very inferiority of the printing,
coupled with recognizable ornaments and types, with the imposition
of many items as quartos in half-sheets, permit the identification
of such works as printed in Dublin.</p>
</div2>

<div2 type="section" n="5"><head></head>
<p>If we are to have a comprehensive picture of printing in Ireland
in the seventeenth century, it should also take into consideration
another element which became even more pronounced in the eighteenth
century: the books which were printed in Ireland but published in
England. Of these several are well known, among them the two works
by Roger Boyle, Earl of Orrery, reissued in London by Henry
Herringman: his <hi rend="italic">Parthenissa,</hi> printed in Waterford, and his
<hi rend="italic">Poems on Most of the Festivals of the Church,</hi> printed in
Cork. Both were recognized for what they are by Henry Bradshaw's
keen eye. Peter Walsh's <hi rend="italic">History &amp; Vindication of the Loyal
Formulary, or Irish Remonstrance</hi> of 1674 is of interest not
only, as Walsh recounts in his introduction, because the sheets for
a large part of the book had been printed by 1669 in Dublin (a
statement supported by typographic evidence), but also because,
with Fr. Harold's writings, it does prove that Walsh and his
Catholic friends had
access to the King's Printing-House in Dublin.</p>
<p>That by the third quarter of the seventeenth century it was
considered practical to ship sheets of Irish-printed books to
England for sale there sets the back-ground for less ethical
developments in the following century.</p>
</div2>

<div2 type="section" n="6"><head></head>
<p>To complete the possible complications which should be
considered it remains only to encounter false imprints "in
reverse,"&mdash;that is, works purporting to be printed in Ireland
which were not. Of such, an edition of Jacobus Sylvius's
<hi rend="italic">Novissima idea de febribus</hi> provides an example. Although
Dix
apparently accepted it as genuine, the imprint "Dublinii, MDC.XCIV.
Sumptibus Zachari&aelig; Conzatti" is unquestionably false. This
edition, dedicated to "Io: Baptist&aelig; Sylvestrino, Celeberrimo
Pharmacopole" by Giovanni Baptista Conzatti, gives every evidence
of having been printed in Italy, as one might deduce from such a
dedication. Paper and type support this conclusion, while the copy
in the Dix Collection at the National Library of Ireland is in a
contemporary vellum binding which bears a manuscript inscription in
Italian.</p>
<p>Similarly, the edition of <hi rend="italic">A Declaration of the Commons of
England . . . expressing their Reasons and Grounds of passing the
late Resolutions</hi> with its imprint, "London, Printed for Edward
Husband <hi rend="italic">Feb.</hi> 16, 1647. Reprinted at

<pb n="006.237"/>

Kilkenny in the yeare 1648," offers no typographic evidence of
having been printed there: that it is a London reprint of a later
date, using the Kilkenny phrase as a screen for piracy, I have
little reason to question.</p>
</div2>

<div2 type="section" n="7"><head></head>
<p>That the problems of Irish printing of the seventeenth century
offer a wide opportunity for investigation will, I trust, be
granted: it is not simply a matter of provincial printing with
inferior craftsmen. Aside from the intrinsic interest of Irish
printing itself, it is evident that if we are to have authoritative
knowledge of English printing, we must establish clearly what was
printed elsewhere, in Scotland and in Ireland particularly. For
this all the resources of bibliographical research will be
required: a knowledge of type, of paper, of binding, and of
printing practices, as well as of the social background which
provided the substance for the publications themselves.</p>

<p>On statistical evidence alone, certain probabilities are
immediately apparent. First, the Harvard manuscript, with only 43
unique readings and 12 shared unique readings,
<ref target="f006.17.06" n="6"><hi rend="super">6</hi></ref> bears the closest relation to Q1.
Since
its relatively few shared unique readings are distributed almost
evenly among the other MSS, there is no reason to assume either
that H derived from any of them, or that it bears a closer relation
to any one of the three MSS than to the remaining two. Instead, it
is clearly related to Q1, although whether in radiation from a
common ancestor or in a straight line of descent cannot be
determined by statistical evidence.</p>
<p>Second, the large number of unique readings in M, B, and Hn
suggest that each is a terminal text, although the 31 variants that
exist between the two Huntington MSS indicate that they are
terminal only in relation to the other MSS since the variation
between them suggests, but cannot prove until its content is
examined, that one of the Hn MSS may have derived from the
other.</p>
<p>Third, the agreement of 66 readings in B, M, and Hn against H
and Q1 suggests the possibility that each of the two groups may
have derived from an exclusive common ancestor.</p>
<p>Finally, the agreement of 76 readings in B and Hn against
readings supported by all other texts suggests the possibility that
B and Hn may owe these readings to a later ancestor than the one
they presumably share with M.</p>
<p>Since statistical evidence alone cannot prove any of these
assumptions to be true, the line of descent can only be established
with certainty by an analysis of the readings themselves. The
results of this, too detailed to elaborate here, can be summarized
under the heading of each manuscript as follows:

</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Harvard MS</hi></p>
<p>The fragmentary state of the first two pages of this MS
precludes the possibility that any other text derived from it.
Furthermore, although many of the 43 unique readings are
correctable scribal errors, others, consisting largely of omitted
words, are not obvious errors and would have been followed by any
MS descending directly from H. Of the 12 readings that H shares
with one or more manuscripts, all are of minor significance since
they involve only a simple variance such as the change from
singular to plural. In no instance does an analysis of the readings
indicate that H is any closer to one MS than to another. One can
assume, however, since it is known that Dryden revised the text,
that, apart from the first two pages, it represents a good version
of the archetype.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">British Museum MS</hi></p>
<p>The 317 unique substantive readings of the MS include the
omission of six lines and 11 words that appear in all other MSS. On
this basis, therefore, it is evident that M is a terminal text. Of
the 66 readings shared by M, B, and Hn, although many of them are
minor variants of no significance, the majority involve a more
meaningful change that precludes coincidence and indicates the

<pb n="006.240"/>

existence of an exclusive common ancestor for the three MSS. The
following three selected readings, with Q1 providing the lemma and
the variant italicized, will illustrate:
</p>
<list>
<item>1. this new <hi rend="italic">created</hi> Orb] new <hi rend="italic">made</hi>
(II.i.30.)</item>

<item>2. Enjoy and <hi rend="italic">blast</hi> her] <hi rend="italic">blesse</hi>
(III.i.95.)</item>

<item>3. with <hi rend="italic">early</hi> care] <hi rend="italic">cheerful</hi>
(V.i.381.)</item>

</list>

<p>That each of these readings is coherent in its variant form and
would have been accepted by any scribe finding it in his exemplar
is self-evident. It is obvious, then, that they must have
originated in the manuscript that served as the exclusive common
ancestor for M, B, and Hn. The identity of that ancestor, however,
must be determined on the basis of two possible alternatives: (1)
the readings originated in the archetype and represent the author's
intentions; or (2) they originated in an non-extant MS as
corruptions of the archetype and were retained by all descendents
of that text. If the first possibility is accepted, the 66 readings
as they are in H and in Q1 become corruptions of the original text.
Since, however, the majority of the readings shared by M, B, and Hn
against H and Q1 destroy the point of the line or upset the metre,
this alternative must be rejected in favor of the second. On this
basis one can postulate the hypothetical manuscript &bgr;, the
originator of the 66 variant readings and the exclusive common ancestor of the family
of M, B, and Hn.</p>
<p>In addition to the 66 variants shared by the three MSS, it will
be remembered that statistical evidence shows further agreement
between M and B of 30 shared unique readings, and 19 between M and
Hn. Examination of the readings, however, proves them to be without
significance since they are either minor variants such as "over"
for "o're", or readings that have further variation in the other
MSS that obviates their importance.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Bodleian MS</hi></p>
<p>Among the 181 unique substantive readings of B there are three
hiatuses, and 15 words and one speech prefix omitted from the text
but supplied by all other MSS. These omissions, together with the
many unique readings that are sufficiently coherent in B to have
been accepted by any derived text, offer conclusive evidence that
it is a terminal MS. With the family relationship of B, M, and Hn
already established, there is still the relationship between B and
Hn to consider. This statistical evidence indicates, on the basis
of 76 shared unique readings, might be closer than that of the
family directly descended from &bgr;.</p>
<p>Examination of the shared variants shows that they include one
hiatus, the omission of four words and one speech heading supplied
by M, H, and Q1, and one stage direction that differs from the
other texts. Since B is a terminal manuscript, and, as will be
shown later, Hn is also terminal in so far as the other MSS are
concerned, none of these variants could have originated in either
B or Hn and descended to the other. Three examples, selected from
over 50 possible ones, will illustrate that these variants could
only have originated in a non-extant MS from which only B and Hn
derived:

</list>
</p>
<p>Although the remaining 22 agreements between B and Hn are minor
variants of no significance, since the other 54 cannot be
attributed to coincidence without defying common sense, the
hypothetical MS &ggr; is postulated as the immediate descendent of
&bgr; and the originator of the significant agreements between B and
Hn, which become a sub-family descended from &ggr;.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Huntington MSS</hi></p>
<p>The 219 unique readings in the two Huntington MSS include three
hiatuses, the omission of 11 lines, 19 words, and one speech
prefix, and the addition of 11 words not present in the other MSS.
On this evidence, it is unnecessary to present further proof that
no extant MS could have derived from them. Furthermore, since the
relationship between Hn and the other MSS has already been
established, it is now only necessary to restore the two Huntington
MSS, until now considered as one, to their original status of two
documents in order to demonstrate the descent of one from the
other.</p>
<p>Statistical evidence shows 31 variant readings between them:
seven unique in Hn<hi rend="super">1</hi>; 24 unique in Hn<hi rend="super">2</hi>.
All that can be
determined from these facts is that one descended from the other or
that both descended collaterally from the same source. Analysis of
the readings, however, demonstrates that they are not collateral
but did, in fact, descend one from the other with Hn<hi rend="super">1</hi>
serving as
the parent of Hn<hi rend="super">2</hi>. None of the seven unique readings in
Hn<hi rend="super">1</hi>
is of significance since each is a correctable scribal error. On
the other hand, among the 24 unique readings in Hn<hi rend="super">2</hi> there
is the
omission of one whole line, four half-lines, and two words, as well
as the addition of one word. Since all of these readings are
supported not only by Hn<hi rend="super">1</hi> but also by all other texts, it
is
evident that Hn<hi rend="super">2</hi> is a terminal text. Had
Hn<hi rend="super">1</hi> and Hn<hi rend="super">2</hi>
derived independently from an exclusive common ancestor, the
incidence of variation between them would have been far greater.
Since Hn<hi rend="super">1</hi> could not
have descended from Hn<hi rend="super">2</hi>, it is reasonable to assume that
the
reverse obtains and that Hn<hi rend="super">2</hi>, although correcting or
modifying
the seven unique readings of Hn<hi rend="super">1</hi>, descended directly from
the
latter, adding 24 unique readings in the process.</p>
<p>With the derivation of the five extant MSS established, their
relative authority is also indicated. Hn<hi rend="super">2</hi>, at the bottom of
the
manuscript tree, is four removes from the archetype; Hn<hi rend="super">1</hi>
and B,
both descended from &ggr;, are three; and M, descended from &bgr;, is
two. Only H is directly descended from the archetype and becomes,
therefore, the most authoritative of the five extant MSS. As such,
the relationship of H to Q1 is of paramount importance.</p>
<p>Although the Harvard MS contains the least number of variants
from Q1 of all the extant MSS, it did not serve as copy for the
printed text. Instead, a manuscript now lost (presumably retained
and destroyed by the printer) was transcribed under Dryden's
supervision to be used by the printer. This manuscript, hereafter
to be referred to as "q", derived independently from the archetype

<pb n="006.242"/>

which itself had been revised and augmented by the author for the
purpose of publication.</p>
<p>The evidence found in H to support this hypothesis falls into
the two categories of

<list>
<item>1. Corrections and emendations in H.</item>

<item>2. Readings in H that differ from Q1 but are supported by all
other MSS.</item>

</list>
</p>
<p>There are 66 corrections or emendations in H which can be
divided into five classifications:<ref target="f006.17.07" n="7"><hi rend="super">7</hi></ref>

<list>
<item>a. Scribal corrections obviously made during the process of
transcription which bring the reading into agreement with all other
MSS and Q1. 32 examples.</item>

<item>b. Scribal and authorial corrections apparently inserted
after transcription which bring the reading into agreement with the
other MSS and Q1. 18 examples.</item>

<item>c. Emendations, which I believe to be authorial, that depart
from the reading shared by all MSS and are retained in Q1. Seven
examples.</item>

<item>d. Emendations, which I believe to be authorial, that depart
from the reading shared by all MSS and are not found in Q1, which
restores the original reading. Five examples.</item>

<item>e. Emendations, both scribal and authorial, that show further
revision in Q1. Four examples.</item>

</list>
</p>
<p>The significance of the first and second groups rests in the
fact that both the scribe and the author corrected the manuscript
with considerable care in order to restore its readings to what
must have been, on the evidence of agreement in the other MSS,
their original form. That Dryden corrected it at all is testimony
that the manuscript was sufficiently close to the archetype to
warrant such action by the author.</p>
<p>The readings in the third group are important because they are
clearly deliberate improvements made in H and retained in Q1 either
to correct or to emend the archetype.</p>
<p>The fourth group, more complicated than the rest, consists of
five readings which I shall reproduce here as they appear in the
manuscript.</p>

<p>
 <!-- <figure entity="sb062421"></figure> -->
</p>

<pb n="006.243"/>

<p>None of the readings in their emended form appears in Q1 but all
of the crossed-out readings are not only in Q1 but also in the
other MSS.<ref target="f006.17.08" n="8"><hi rend="super">8</hi></ref> All that can be
determined with certainty is that the crossed-out readings derived
from the archetype and were revised in H by the author. Why the
revisions are not retained in Q1 is impossible to establish with
absolute conviction, although it is safe to assume that they were
not present in the MS that served as printer's copy. It becomes
necessary, therefore, to make a final decision concerning the
nature of q, the MS behind Q1, and its relation to H. There are two
alternatives: (1) it derived from H in the main, but was further
revised and augmented by Dryden before being given to the printer;
or (2) it is a MS independently derived from the archetype, revised
and augmented by Dryden shortly before the play was published in
1677.</p>
<p>In the first explanation, H becomes the initial step in the
process of revision that was to culminate in Q1; and the five
readings emended in H that revert back to their original form in Q1
are merely readings rejected by the author in his final revision of
the play. Unfortunately, however, this theory does not take into
consideration the unique readings in H which, although relatively
few in number, are still sufficient to establish the MS as a
terminal text as has already been demonstrated. Moreover, it is
impossible to overlook the fragmentary state of the first two pages
of H. Only if one assumes that the scribe of q was presented with
a freshly written leaf containing the lines omitted in H, as well
as all the additional material that appears in Q1, which will
shortly be discussed, can even partial derivation of q from H be
accepted. The obvious difficulties to this theory make the second
alternative the more probable.</p>
<p>In this, H becomes a MS that was sufficiently close to the
archetype to warrant partial revision by Dryden at some time. When
he decided to print the play, three years after it was written, he
also decided to augment it with various embellishments designed to
please an audience. One can postulate, then, that the Harvard
manuscript was no longer in his possession and that a new
manuscript was prepared from the archetype, which had already been
revised by the author to include the several changes and additions
that appear in Q1. This manuscript, deriving independently from the
archetype, would not contain the unique errors of H, but would
retain some of the emendations found in H either because Dryden had
already noted them in his foul papers when he altered H, or because
he remembered them and made them again. The group of five readings
that do not appear in Q1 as emended in H were either rejected by
the author in his final revision of the play or forgotten. On the
evidence of the
readings themselves, the first conjecture seems the more
likely.</p>
<p>The readings in the fifth group, emendations both scribal and
authorial that show further revision in Q1, offer additional
evidence of the care with which Dryden revised his play, first in
H and later in q.</p>
<p>Considered collectively, the five groups of corrections and
emendations in H provide further proof that H did not serve as copy
for Q1. The manuscript

<pb n="006.244"/>

behind Q1 is q, in all probability a transcript of the revised
archetype. Conclusive evidence of the existence of this manuscript
is to be found by examining the readings in H that differ from Q1
but are supported by all other MSS. This material can be divided
into the following eight groups:

</p>
<p>1. The title of the play as it appears in Q1 is <hi rend="italic">The State of
Innocence, and Fall of Man</hi>. In all the manuscripts, with slight
modification, it is <hi rend="italic">The Fall of Angells and Man in
Innocence,</hi> the title under which the play was registered by
Herringman in 1674. Since the emphasis of the play is on Adam and
Eve and their fall from grace, rather than on the fall of the
angels, which is important only as it affects and parallels the
human situation, the title as given in Q1 is the appropriate one,
undoubtedly authorized by Dryden.</p>
<p>2. The character of <hi rend="italic">Asmoday</hi> in Q1 is called
<hi rend="italic">Asmodell</hi> in all manuscripts. In view of the fact that the
names of all the angels in the play end in "el", Dryden may have
realized that <hi rend="italic">Asmodell</hi> carried an unsuitable angelic
connotation for a devil and made the change accordingly.</p>
<p>3. The speech prefix to Lucifer's short line on B1<hi rend="super">v</hi>,
line 26
of Q1 is omitted in all MSS. Whether this is an authorial
correction made for Q1 or an inadvertent compositorial addition is
debatable. On the literary evidence of the entire passage, however,
I believe it to be authorial.</p>
<p>4. The opening stage direction of Q1 omits the two phrases
"thunder is heard and flashes of lightning seen" and "A shower of
fire rains over the stage". Q1 adds the direction "and a hymn
sung." Since the omitted phrases also appear in the opening stage
direction of Shadwell's operatic version of the Dryden-Davenant
<hi rend="italic">The Tempest,</hi> Dryden may have decided against repeating a
device already in use at the rival theatre where <hi rend="italic">The Tempest</hi>
remained popular for ten years. The addition of a hymn to the
printed text is clearly an attempt to meet the growing demand of
the public for more music in the theatre.</p>
<p>5. The long stage direction at the end of Act I, the short
directions on C1<hi rend="super">v</hi> and D2<hi rend="super">r</hi>, and the
<hi rend="italic">aside</hi> on C4<hi rend="super">v</hi>
of
Q1 do not appear in any manuscript. Each of these is theatrical in
purpose, provided in order to please an audience by offering a more
colorful spectacle on the one hand, and to instruct an actor on the
other. As such they are clear indications that Dryden revised his
play carefully for publication not only to defend his literary
reputation, but because he hoped that the play would finally be
performed.</p>
<p>6. There are no scene headings apart from the first of each act
in Q1. All manuscripts divide Act IV into two scenes. Whether this
unimportant omission is authorial or compositorial cannot be
determined, but it was clearly intended to preserve uniformity of
scene headings.</p>
<p>7. Q1 lacks five lines that appear in all manuscripts: two pairs
of couplets; and a single line. The first is a line that occurs
early in Act II when Raphael is explaining to Adam that his single
state on earth is comparable to that of the Almighty who, like
Adam, has no equals, only servants. In the printed text Adam
somewhat abruptly replies, "Why did he Reason in my Soul implant?"
(II.i.57.) The additional line in the manuscripts provides not only
a smoother but a less arrogant speech which reads

<pb n="006.245"/>
<q>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>Such state is far above my Humble Wish
</l><l>Why did he Reason in my Soul implant?
</l></lg>
</q>
</p>

<p>It is significant that the omission of the line in the quarto
breaks the pattern of rhymed couplets consistent thus far in the
act and leaves a line that stands alone. The MS reading provides
the couplet but the word "wish" destroys the rhyme. Since, however,
the inclusion of the line is preferable both metrically and
dramatically, one is forced to believe that its omission from Q1
was caused by compositorial eye skip rather than by authorial
deletion.<ref target="f006.17.09" n="9"><hi rend="super">9</hi></ref></p>
<p>The first of the two couplets is in Act III, appended to the end
of Lucifer's soliloquy in which he vows vengeance on Adam and Eve.
In Q1 the passage ends

<q>
<lg type="verse">
<l>live happy whilst you may</l>
<l>Blest pair, y'are not alow'd another day!</l>
<l>(III.i.99-100.)</l>
</lg>
</q>

In the MSS these lines follow immediately:

<q>
<lg type="verse">
<l>Honour and Empire, where no Quarrels lye</l>
<l>Are pleas for Universall Monarchy.</l>
</lg>
</q>

Since the lines in the MSS have no bearing on the subject of the
speech as a whole, which is concerned with Lucifer's terrible
jealousy of Adam and Eve, it seems safe to assume that Dryden
himself deleted the lines in recognition of their irrelevancy.</p>
<p>The second of the two couplets is also in Act III in the scene
of Eve's vision. Here the woman in the dream, protesting that she
will die if she tastes the fruit, asks, "and who can Heav'n
withstand?" (III.ii.24.) To which in Q1 the angel replies, "Why was
it made so fair, why plac'd in sight?" In the MSS, however, the
angel answers

<q>
<lg type="verse">
<l>Sweet Creature, no</l>
<l>Believe not so</l>
<l>Why was it made so fair, why plac'd in sight?</l>
</lg>
</q>


The result is incoherent since the words "Believe not so", if they
refer to anything, go back to the woman's first statement
concerning her fear of death. The deletion of the lines is a marked
improvement that is certainly authorial.</p>
<p>8. Q1 differs from all manuscripts in 41 additional substantive
readings. These readings, varying in significance, can be divided
into two main categories:

<list>
<item>(a.) Q1 changes in words intended to improve the sense, the
metre, or the grammar of the line that can be demonstrated as
authorial. There are 26 in this category.</item>

<item>(b.) Variants that are due to compositorial error in Q1. Of
these there are 15.</item>

</list>
</p>



<p>As it is impossible here to discuss each of these readings, two
representative examples from each group must suffice. Early in Act
III Eve, describing her nuptial bower, lists the flowers that grow
around it:
</p>
<pb n="006.246"/>

<lg type="verse">
<l>Thy <hi rend="italic">Myrtle,</hi> Orange, and the blushing Rose,</l>
<l>(III.i.60.)</l>
</lg>
<p>
and a few lines later,
</p>
<lg type="verse">
<l>And creeping 'twixt' em <hi rend="italic">all,</hi> the mant'ling Vine,</l>
<l>(III.i.65.)</l>
</lg>
<p>
The manuscripts, however, read:
</p>
<lg type="verse">
<l>The <hi rend="italic">Bridegroom</hi> Orange and the blushing Rose</l>
<l>. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</l>
<l>And creeping 'twixt 'em <hi rend="italic">both,</hi> the mantling Vine</l>
</lg>

<p>The change from "Bridegroom" to "Myrtle" could not have been
compositorial since the two words are so unlike that neither
misreading nor memorial failure could have occasioned it. Far more
probable is that in going over the text, Dryden realized that the
original image of the orange as the bridegroom and the rose as the
bride was strained and artificial. Accordingly, he substituted
"myrtle," the flower sacred to Venus, and the subsequent change
from "both" to "all" followed logically. The word "Thy" in Q1 is,
of course, a misprint for "The".</p>
<p>From the second category, those 15 substantive variants in Q1
which I consider compositorial errors, both examples chosen for
illustration are to be found in Act III. The first comes in
Lucifer's soliliquy as he listens in anguish to Adam and Eve
discuss their wedding night:
</p>
<lg type="verse">
<l>. . . as if Heav'n meant to shew</l>
<l>What in base <hi rend="italic">matter</hi> such a hand could do]
<hi rend="italic">matters</hi>
Q1</l>
<l>(III.i.50.)</l>
</lg>

<p>The MS reading, which is consonant with the Miltonic doctrine of
matter from which all creation was formed, was obviously
misunderstood by the compositor who "improved" the reading by
adding an erroneous "s".</p>
<p>The second, which refers to the flowers in the arbor, reads
</p>
<lg type="verse">
<l>With bending <hi rend="italic">heads</hi> so nigh their blooms disclose]
<hi rend="italic">heaps</hi> Q1</l>
<l>(III.i.61.)</l>
</lg>

<p>A close examination of Q1 reveals that this is a clear example of
a turned letter "d" printed as "p". Despite the nonsense that
results, the compositor's error remained undetected through all the
early texts and has been retained in all modern editions.</p>
<p>When one considers all the variants between Q1 and the unities
of the manuscripts, it is evident that, except for a few
compositorial errors, the Q1 variants can be attributed to the
author. Since the manuscript that contained them represents the
author's final intentions concerning the words and action of the
play, Q1, deriving from this manuscript which itself descended
independently from the archetype, is clearly the text of highest
substantive authority.</p>

<p>After an early misunderstanding, Johnson's bibliographers are
now generally agreed that the <hi rend="italic">Journey to the Western Islands of
Scotland</hi> (1775), previously described as of one or two or three
states or impressions or issues, is properly identified as of two
separate editions.<ref target="f006.18.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref> Nevertheless,
as confusion still persists and, in fact, is still encouraged by
those who find some advantage in the earlier classifications, it
seems advisable at the outset to specify the exact nature of the
variants. With this much recorded, the writer may then be indulged
a few speculations as to how these variants were produced. For the
latter purpose conjecture is supported by abundant evidence.
Besides the material available in the <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> and

certain data on the printing of the cancels. These, it appears,
were set with the title and errata leaves by half-sheet imposition,

of
U4<hi rend="super">v</hi> from '226' to '296'. Then, after all work had been
printed,
and perfected on the same forme, the two copies of each sheet were
cut apart and each copy placed at the end of the pile of folded
text sheets, following 2B8, as a four-leaf gathering ordered
D8<hi rend="super">r-v</hi>. 2C1<hi rend="super">v-r</hi>(inverted). *

<p>From the juxtaposition of these leaves it is evident (1) that

<head>II Chronology of Presswork.</head>

<p>The earlier printing of the <hi rend="italic">Journey</hi> can be traced most
conveniently through the author's correspondence. On the 20th of
June, 1774, we learn, the first sheets were put to press (356
<ref target="f006.18.05" n="5"><hi rend="super">5</hi></ref>); and work then continued without
interruption until the 4th of July (357), when Johnson left for his
excursion to Wales. Though Boswell was assured that the press would
"go on slowly for a time," it is very doubtful that much was done,
for after Johnson's return on September 30 his correspondent is
informed that the work had been "detained" or "suspended" (363,
360) in his absence. Now that he was again in London, however, he
proposed "to drive the book forward," and forward it went until
October 20, when Johnson reported that, as 240 pages were then
printed, the book might be out in a month (360.1). By the 20th,
then, the 15 signatures through Q had been completed and 9 remained
to be finished.</p>
<p>If we now assume that, except for an odd sheet or two, all
printing was in fact suspended between July 4 and September 30, it
will be observed that sustained work on the 15 signatures covered
about five weeks, two before the trip, three after. This would mean
that the sheets were processed at the rate of three a week, with B
through G completed in the first sequence and H through Q in the
second. That there was an interruption after G is confirmed in
various ways, first by the appearance at I of two pressmen (1 and
7) not previously

<pb n="006.250"/>

engaged; secondly by the occurrence in the outer forme of H of an
imperfect headline,<ref target="f006.18.06" n="6"><hi rend="super">6</hi></ref> the result,
apparently of temporary storage against other formes; thirdly by
the presence of numerous errors in the text. Before G, the author
carefully revised his proofs, but afterwards, while the book was
being 'driven forward,' he was less attentive and thus required the
listing of errata for most of the signatures between H and T.</p>
<p>So long as Johnson was pressing forward on the nine sheets
H&mdash;Q
he had every reason to believe that, according to the previous
rate, the nine remaining sheets (R&mdash;2B) could be finished in three
weeks and the book published, as he expected, within the month. But
shortly after this announcement the printing was so considerably
retarded that the final proofs were not corrected until November 25
(363), the first of several cancels not proposed until the 30th
(364), the work on the title-errata-cancels half-sheet thus not
completed, probably, before December 12, and the first copy made
ready for Mrs. Thrale's inspection not until December 17 (365.2).
So, as it happened, the book confidently anticipated some time in
November was eventually finished by the middle of December and, as
the holiday season was then in full sway, deferred for publication
until toward the end of January. Much of this delay is certainly
due to Johnson; some may be traced to new measures belatedly
adopted in
the printing house.</p>
<p>Before the final proofs were returned there are several
indications that Strahan, the printer, had already decided that the
sale of the <hi rend="italic">Journey</hi> would exceed his expectation; and as on
earlier occasions<ref target="f006.18.07" n="7"><hi rend="super">7</hi></ref> so on this he
thereupon arranged that the issue of sheets for work still in hand,
or still in prospect, should be increased from 2000 to 4000 copies,
and that all work previously machined and distributed should be
reset for another run of 2000 copies. With this arrangement in
effect, no matter how long Johnson delayed the printing of the
first edition, and no matter how much the Christmas season might
then delay its publication, work on the increased issue&mdash;or as it
should now be called, the second edition&mdash;could proceed in
whatever order the convenience of the printer might dictate. Then
as the proofs for the remaining sheets of the first edition were
returned, these could be worked off with the others, and both
editions then brought to
completion one after the other. How and when all this work might
have been accomplished remains to be determined.</p>
<p>Of the sheets printed after Q but before any increase in issue
there are only five: R, T, U, X, and Y. Quite probably, therefore,
these were machined at the usual rate of three signatures a week,
at 2000 copies a forme, and were completed by Saturday, November 5.
It may have been on the following Monday, then, that Strahan, a
little irked at Johnson's procrastination, decided to go ahead with
the new edition. From the type, press figures, and headlines it is
evident that this decision was reached at a time when all but the
last page of Y had been distributed, while all of Z and 2A were
still intact, and before the original

<pb n="006.251"/>

printing of S, 2B, title, errata, and cancels. These several pages
and sheets thus occur in an identical setting for both editions. In
the second edition the pages D8<hi rend="super">r-v</hi>,
U4<hi rend="super">r-v</hi>, and Y8<hi rend="super">v</hi> appear
as reimpressions in formes otherwise reset; the title and errata
page (less five readings corrected in the second edition) as
reimpressions now imposed together as a quarter-sheet; the full
signature Z as a delayed impression (skeletons reversed, different
figures); 2A as an interrupted impression (identical skeletons,
different figures); and sheets S and 2B as a continuous impression
(identical skeletons and figures). Of the full sheets it will be
noted that S, containing the early charges of Johnson's mounting
assault on Macpherson, was so long withheld that it was finally
worked off with the last signatures of the book.</p>
<p>Among these later sheets, however, there is one important
distinction: Though S was eventually machined without alteration,
the work on 2A and 2B was stopped half-way through the impression
to admit an asterisk before the initial signatures. Apparently, as
Strahan may have realized after the completion of S&mdash;and possibly
several other sheets&mdash;some mark was needed so that the
warehouse-man could segregate the heaps for the first edition from
those to be reserved for the second. By this means the printer
anticipated the corrections Johnson later proposed and was able to
keep the amended sheets apart from the others.</p>
<p>Since the asterisk seems to have been deliberately introduced
and consistently used thereafter it may serve to identify all
sheets printed before its appearance. These include not only all
properly belonging to the first edition and the solitary sheet S,
continuously impressed for both editions, but also E and most
copies of B of the second edition. At least this number, then, were
printed off before Johnson returned the last several proofs of the
first edition.</p>
<p>It will now be expedient to summarize, in tabular form, the
schedule of events from the time Strahan decided to enlarge the
issue until the day when Mrs. Thrale received the first copy off
the press.</p>

<p>To the other signs of progression may be added, finally, the
evidence of the headlines. As defined in Table I these recur in
groups of four (two for each signature), originally combined in the
sequence YEND, and then modified in the course of presswork through
various other combinations. Again, unless we

forme, in this instance&mdash;a definite order may be presumed from
these gradations, and specific indications of that order discerned
at those points where the skeletons are altered or replaced by
others. The peculiar characteristics of the headlines and the
extent to which each is used may be seen in the following

When compared with the full account to be found in Table I, this
exemplifies the expected irregularity in the printing of the second
edition. Evidently signature N preceded M; U preceded all
signatures after H; and R and X, as well as others using the
W<hi rend="super">1</hi>Y
skeletons, normally came after those using a different
combination.</p>
<p>With these and all other considerations in mind, and now
adjusted one against the other, we may next offer in Table II a
hypothetical sequence of all printing from the first sheet of the
first edition to the last sheet of the second. Admitting Johnson's
own statement that the book was laid on press June 20, 1774, and
allowing the presumption implicit in a later remark that the work
generally proceeded at the rate of 6000 copies a week (3 sheets x
2000, or 1&frac12; x 4000), both editions could easily have been
finished by January 16, 1775, two days before the first went on
sale. That Strahan had actually committed himself this far, before
he had a chance to gauge the demand for the first edition, is
admittedly a questionable speculation. Even this, however, is more
plausible than the alternative: that having resolved upon a second,
and having printed off a few sheets for this, he then lost heart
and did nothing further.</p>

<pb n="006.253"/>

<p>That the schedule is, indeed, something more than a possibility
appears in two references: one a reported statement by Cadell, the
publisher, that 4000 copies were sold in the first week; the other,
the record of the printing, in which Strahan definitely indicates
that both editions, totalling this number, were charged against the
publisher before the end of the month. Some objection may be raised
against the first report in view of occasional advertisements,
probably for remainders, as late as four months after the time
alleged. Perhaps this account represents the usual exaggeration to
be expected of a publisher, or a story essentially true when first
related but somewhat embellished when it was relayed by another
person.<ref target="f006.18.09" n="9"><hi rend="super">9</hi></ref> Concerning the second
report, however, no question arises, since this is in Strahan's own
hand.<ref target="f006.18.10" n="10"><hi rend="super">10</hi></ref>

This tends more to confirm than to deny a simultaneous issue. If
not on the same day, then certainly within two weeks after the
original publication another edition had unobtrusively appeared on
the market to meet a demand long anticipated and now fully
satisfied.</p>

<name type="title">The Publishing of Meredith's
<hi rend="italic">Rhoda
Fleming</hi></name>
<lb/><hi rend="italic">by</hi><lb/> <name type="author">Richard B.
Hudson</name>
</head>

<div2 type="section"><head></head>
<p>The account of the publication of George Meredith's <hi rend="italic">Rhoda
Fleming</hi> that has been accepted universally is based on a letter
from Meredith to his friend Canon Augustus Jessopp on April 24,
1865. "Tinsley offers &pound;400 for Rhoda Fleming. . . I don't quite
like to sell it for that sum. Chapman and Hall

<pb n="006.255"/>

bids me wait till November."<ref target="f006.19.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref> Since

William Tinsley did publish <hi rend="italic">Rhoda Fleming</hi> in October of
1865,<ref target="f006.19.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref> the impeccably logical
assumption has always been that Meredith accepted his offer,
however reluctantly.<ref target="f006.19.03" n="3"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref> An
unpublished letter in my possession from Meredith to Tinsley,
however, shows that, contrary to what one would expect in the usual
author-publisher relationship, Meredith was in debt to Tinsley some
years <hi rend="italic">after</hi> the appearance of <hi rend="italic">Rhoda Fleming</hi>,
and
leads me to raise some questions about this transaction.</p>
<p>The letter in my possession is dated simply "July 3<hi rend="italic">rd</hi>,"
but the paper bears the water mark "Joynson 1867." Meredith asks
Tinsley to make an overnight visit to Box Hill to see "MSS in
progress to completion," and appoints a time for the visit.
<ref target="f006.19.04" n="4"><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref> Then there occurs this crucial
sentence: "The debt has been left unsettled owing to my having kept
back my work to perfect it more. It was honourably incurred by me
out of consideration for your house, because I doubted the chances
of the novel attaining popularity: but it must not the less be
paid. . . ." Meredith has work in hand that will easily pay off the
debt, in other words, whether Tinsley publishes it or not.
<ref target="f006.19.05" n="5"><hi rend="super">5</hi></ref> The debt, however, has arisen
from a
published work, which can only be <hi rend="italic">Rhoda Fleming,</hi> since that

is the only work of Meredith's Tinsley has published.</p>
<p>Typed copies of two other short letters to Tinsley and the
original of a third are in the Yale University Library and refer to
this debt; two of them add scraps of information, although one
merely repeats the invitation to Box Hill in much the same terms as
in my letter. The second is dated Oct. 18, 1870, five years after
the publication of <hi rend="italic">Rhoda Fleming</hi>. The date is important not
only in dating the transaction but also in accounting for Tinsley's
urgency, since he failed in that year.
<ref target="f006.19.06" n="6"><hi rend="super">6</hi></ref> The third tells us that the debt is
in
the form of a bill that has come due; Meredith asks Tinsley to take
&pound;40 and wait a couple of months for the rest.
<ref target="f006.19.07" n="7"><hi rend="super">7</hi></ref> But none states the reason for the
debt.</p>
<p>There are, of course, many ways in which Meredith might have got
himself

<pb n="006.256"/>

into debt to Tinsley even after accepting Tinsley's offer&mdash;a
personal debt (highly unlikely, since Meredith and Tinsley were not
intimate); a business debt incurred in buying back his copyright
from Tinsley; an advance on a contract Meredith found himself
unable to fulfill (he had work in progress). If the sentence I have
quoted from my letter refers to any of these possibilities,
however, Meredith is talking in uncommonly strange terms.</p>
<p>This sentence can only be explained, I think, if one starts with
the assumption that Meredith's reluctance prevailed and that he did
<hi rend="italic">not</hi> accept Tinsley's offer for <hi rend="italic">Rhoda Fleming</hi>.
If
Meredith incurred a debt to Tinsley because he doubted that
<hi rend="italic">Rhoda Fleming</hi> would become popular and was afraid Tinsley

would lose money by the transaction, that debt must have been the
production costs of the novel. Meredith must have published the
work at his own expense&mdash; "on commission terms" as it was known.
Meredith no doubt signed a note for all or the major part of the
production costs&mdash;printing, paper, binding, advertising, and a
commission to the publisher for acting as the author's agent.
<ref target="f006.19.08" n="8"><hi rend="super">8</hi></ref> <hi rend="italic">Rhoda Fleming,</hi>
according to
Tinsley, "had a poor sale."<ref target="f006.19.09" n="9"><hi rend="super">9</hi></ref> It
probably failed to bring in enough to cover the amount of
Meredith's note, and since Tinsley was in financial trouble, he
pressed Meredith for payment.</p>
<p>The inference that Meredith published <hi rend="italic">Rhoda Fleming</hi>
at
his own expense is reinforced by the fact that a year earlier he
had, with high hopes of success, published <hi rend="italic">Emilia in England</hi>

on the same terms with Chapman and Hall. Of <hi rend="italic">Emilia,</hi> he
wrote
Captain Maxse: "It's my undertaking&mdash;the risk mine and the
uncounted profits. I told Chapman I should want a good sum and did
not object to publish the book myself. He though the closing
alternative best, and it may be for me."
<ref target="f006.19.10" n="10"><hi rend="super">10</hi></ref> There is no evidence as to how
successful this venture was, but <hi rend="italic">Emilia</hi> must have sold well
enough to give Meredith confidence to undertake the risk again, a
confidence that in this instance seems to have been misplaced.</p>
<p>So far, I have taken Meredith's statement in my letter at its
face value: he went into debt to Tinsley to save Tinsley from a
probable loss. That this debt represents the production costs of
<hi rend="italic">Rhoda Fleming,</hi> I have no doubt; but it does not follow that
we have to accept the reason Meredith assigns for having undertaken
the debt. If he was reluctant to accept &pound;400 for <hi rend="italic">Rhoda
Fleming,</hi> he was reluctant because he did not think &pound;400
enough. If he therefore undertook to publish the work himself, he
did so in the hope of making more than &pound;400, not out of
gentlemanly concern for the fortunes of William Tinsley. The tone
of his defence of himself is distinctly pious. Certainly his
correspondence shows no such touching desire to indemnify Chapman
and Hall from possible loss. Yet Meredith was Chapman's reader and
a friend of the Chapman family and

<pb n="006.257"/>

had far more reason to be solicitous of Chapman's economic health
than of Tinsley's. The passing of time, however, along with
Meredith's sensitivity to his failures, had brought on an
understandable and thoroughly human rationalization, for which we,
if not Tinsley and the Comic Spirit, can forgive him.</p>

<name type="title">Whitman's Manuscripts for the
Original
"Calamus"
Poems</name>
<lb/><hi rend="italic">by</hi><lb/> <name type="author">Fredson Bowers</name>
</head>

<div2 type="section"><head></head>
<p>In the Library of Clifton Waller Barrett is preserved a wealth
of holograph Walt Whitman manuscripts, much of it poetical. The
heart of this group of manuscripts is the so-called Valentine
Collection, which contains the manuscripts for the majority of the
new poems added to the third or 1860 edition of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of
Grass,</hi> the first of the greatly expanded editions and the text
which among present-day critics is often more highly esteemed than
diplomatically altered later versions. From these manuscripts,
various of which are heavily revised, much can be told of Whitman
as a literary artist. On another plane, a study of the papers and
the inks used for these manuscripts goes a surprising distance
towards establishing a conjectural order of composition; and some
collateral evidence can be utilized to assign a few dates with a
fair degree of confidence.</p>
<p>Of especial interest in these manuscripts is the light which
they shed upon the growth of the biographically significant
grouping of poems printed in the 1860 edition for the first time
under the heading "Calamus." With Mr. Barrett's generous permission
I am in process of preparing for publication an edition of all
these manuscripts which lie behind the 1860 <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass;</hi>

but since the appearance of this volume may be held back for some
time yet, it has seemed best not to delay further making available
to students of Whitman some information which may be of immediate
interest, specifically the story of the inception of the "Calamus"
cluster and the original poems which comprised it. In this
narrative, various flat statements will need to be made without
corroborative evidence, for to document every statement with the
available facts from manuscripts would involve me in evidence and
considerations extending far beyond the mere twelve poems which I
propose to reprint and
to discuss. The bare bones of this present story will be fleshed
with the proper evidence when the full texts and their appropriate
introductions are published. The present paper is merely a preview
and a synopsis.</p>
<p>Briefly, the Valentine-Barrett manuscripts establish with some
certainty the following outline. Between January and May, 1856,
even before the publication of the second edition of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of
Grass,</hi> Whitman seems to have started to plan a greatly expanded
third edition. From this date to June-July of 1857 ensued a period
of furious poetic activity in which Whitman composed at least
sixty-eight new poems. Although in June (?) 1857 he writes that his
'New Bible'

<pb n="006.258"/>

will not be ready before 1859,<ref target="f006.20.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref> yet
in July he owns to having a hundred poems ready for a third
edition, which he plans to print starting with the thirty-two poems
from the plates of the second edition and following with
sixty-eight new ones.<ref target="f006.20.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref> The first
part of this list of the poems which were to succeed the
second-edition plates is preserved in the Valentine-Barrett papers
and effectively demonstrates that at about this date Whitman had
not conceived the idea for his 'clusters' like "Chants Democratic,"
or "Calamus," as found in the 1860 edition. The list is
straightforward, in a quite different order from the 1860 edition;
and in fact, various of the poems later to be grouped under
"Calamus" in 1860 are here scattered among other poems, an
indication that some of the printed "Calamus" poems were not
composed with that theme in mind at all. Although this list breaks
off after poem no. 72, the fact that many of the
Valentine-Barrett manuscripts are numbered according to the system
of this list enables us to reconstruct with only a gap here and
there the complete original scheme for the hundred odd poems as
they were planned for the third edition, and actually composed, by
a date which must closely approximate the summer of 1857.</p>




<p>Thereafter, it is the evidence of the manuscripts that Whitman
(doubtless completely occupied with his duties as editor of the
Brooklyn <hi rend="italic">Daily Times</hi>) wrote little poetry, although he may
have done some revision on the present manuscripts as represented
in the list, until towards the end of his editorship and extending
into his period of freedom thereafter, about June, 1859, another
spurt of poetic activity produced additional poems, many of these
of a calamus nature, as well as considerable expansion and revision
of the poems already written, especially of that long poem called
"Proto-Leaf" in 1860 and "Starting from Paumanok" thereafter, and
also of the poem "So Long!" There is good evidence to date this
second period of composition in the spring and summer of 1859; and
it seems to have been in the summer or early autumn of 1859 that as
a unit he turned over all these manuscripts to his friends, the
Brooklyn printers Rome Brothers, to be typeset and proofs pulled.
The
typesetting seems not to have been designed to print an edition,
but instead merely for the purpose of providing Whitman with
printed proofs from which he could continue with the final
revision. When, later, he went to Boston to oversee the printing of
the third edition by Thayer and Eldridge, this in March of 1860, he
provided Thayer and Eldridge with much of their printer's copy in
the form of these Rome Brothers' proofs, considerably revised, as
well as with some new manuscript material. The Valentine-Barrett
manuscripts represent the actual manuscripts which Whitman turned
over in 1859 to Rome Brothers to be set up for proofs. They were
not themselves the printer's copy for the 1860 text, since the lost
revised proofs were that copy, but by comparing the final state of
the manuscripts with the 1860 printed versions we can reconstruct
the revisions which Whitman made in the Rome Brothers' proofs.</p>
<p>In those manuscripts which can be dated 1857 and earlier, there
is a small amount of homosexual references but no serious emphasis
on it. Moreover, the

<pb n="006.259"/>

poems of this period which were later to become part of "Calamus"
in 1860 are not specifically directed towards this theme and are in
fact reasonably neutral in their attitude and subject.
"Proto-Leaf," entitled in manuscript "Premonition," was a simple
patriotic poem, its sexual lines still to be inserted by 1859
revision. Although most of the poems which can be assigned to 1859
are not numbered as in the 1857 list, yet two particular poems are
assigned such numbers, and one of these is perhaps the most
specifically calamus poem he wrote, part of the "Scented herbage of
my breast" lines printed in 1860 as "Calamus" no. 2. The evidence
seems to indicate that even this frankly calamus poem was composed
before Whitman designed such a sequence. In fact, with the late
exception of "Calamus," there is no hint in the manuscripts that at
the time the papers were sent to Rome Brothers Whitman had planned
a 'cluster' arrangement for his third edition.</p>
<p>The cluster that is exemplified seems to be unique, although
there is some slight evidence that another, to be called
"Droppings," was forming in his mind, this perhaps to be associated
with a group on the love for women. At any rate the cluster we have
consists of a dozen poems which form the nucleus from which the
"Calamus" group was to develop. They are written on small pieces of
white wove paper and though now separated can be demonstrated to
have formed originally part of a little notebook. Each poem is
assigned a roman number I to XII. They are clearly fair copies, and
indeed a draft for no. III is preserved elsewhere in the
Valentine-Barrett Collection. What is of interest is not alone
their text, not alone the revelation they provide of a group of
poems whose original close association has been lost, but also the
highly interesting fact that this sequence was originally entitled
"Live Oak, with Moss" and that in its genesis the live oak, not the
calamus plant, was
Whitman's earliest symbol for 'manly love.' This has been
previously suspected from two jottings reprinted by Bucke in which
a proposed sequence on "the amative love of women" is first
compared with "as <hi rend="italic">Live Oak Leaves</hi> do the passion of
friendship for man" (Bucke, p. 169), and, later, "as the
<hi rend="italic">Calamus-Leaves</hi> are to adhesiveness, manly love" (Bucke, p.
150). But here in these manuscripts is the proof, and the Live Oak
sequence as originally planned.</p>
<p>The first leaf of no. II was printed by Bucke (p. 51) from a
manuscript found among Whitman's papers and in a text which has
only one slight variant from that in the Valentine-Barrett
manuscript. What seems to be a somewhat earlier version of the same
poem is preserved in the Berg Collection of the New York Public
Library, cancelled by Whitman's characteristic diagonal stroke.
That this little notebook in the Valentine-Barrett Collection may
have been copied out and kept by Whitman as a kind of <hi rend="italic">memento
mori</hi> of the occasion the poems commemorate may be indicated by
the inscription on the verso of the Berg copy: "Poems / A Cluster
of Poems, Sonnets expressing the thoughts, pictures, aspirations
&amp;c / Fit to the perused during the days of the approach of Death.
/ (that I have prepared myself for that purpose.&mdash;/ (Remember
now&mdash;/ Remember then". However, this may be a jotting for other
poems.</p>
<p>Without further ado, however, I subtend the twelve poems
reprinted from the manuscripts in the final versions of their texts
without notes as to the originals

<pb n="006.260"/>

of the various revisions contained in them. The original section
title "Live Oak, with Moss" was subsequently crossed out and
"Calamus-Leaves" written-in in an ink which seems to represent just
about the final state of revision before the manuscripts were sent
to the printer.</p>

<l>I saw in Louisiana a live-oak growing,</l>

</lg>
</lg>
<p>It seems clear that in these twelve poems, with somewhat franker
text than Whitman allowed to be printed, we have the start of the
later greatly expanded "Calamus" cluster. In connection with this
little series three points may be mentioned. (1) The poems appear
to be unified and to make up an artistically complete story of
attachment, crisis, and reconstitution. (2) They are manifestly
fair copies and may not represent the earliest form of such a
notebook, if the inscription on the Berg manuscript is to be
credited as referring to a previous copying-out of the cluster. The
present texts were copied in a made-up notebook and written fair at
the same or very nearly the same time.(3) The calamus symbol is
nowhere mentioned in these poems, which instead, in no. I but
especially in no. II, refer to the live oak. It is significant that
the earliest sequence title was "Live Oak, with Moss" and that
"Calamus-Leaves" was substituted shortly before the manuscripts
were sent to the
printer.</p>
<p>The notebook of which these now separate leaves originally
formed a part was made up of twenty leaves: by the contours of the
paper it can be established that these poems were copied in the
present order and that the present poems represent original leaves
1-17, leaving three blank leaves. That these leaves were originally
blank and therefore that the sequence ended with no. XII can be
demonstrated by the fact that later, in a different ink, what in
1860 were numbered "Calamus" 44 and 38 but which are unnumbered in
manuscript were copied on paper that by its contours shows it was
leaf 18 of the notebook, and no. 39 on what was leaf 19. Leaf 20
seems to have been used as part of a revision of the poem "So
Long!" in the collection.</p>
<p>The pen and ink used for the added poems on leaves 18 and 19
also appear to have written various other manuscripts on the same
kind of white wove paper, including what was to become "Enfans
d'Adam" no. 1 and "Calamus" nos. 1, part of 2, and 4. The writing
of the section of no. 2 consisted of prefixed leaves to what was to
become "Scented herbage of my breast", a poem the earliest part of
which is chiefly written on the back of material that can be dated

<pb n="006.265"/>

a few days before 15 March 1859. It is clear, therefore, that the
roman-numbered Live Oak poems may have been copied out in their
present manuscripts before March 1859, though a later date is not
impossible, and that Whitman's true calamus-symbol poems come after
mid-March of this year and on slender other evidence perhaps about
June or July. Since it may seem plausible to believe that the
calamus symbol was not contemporary with the live oak symbol but
that one replaced the other as the theme for a sequence, and since
the earliest known version of a calamus-symbol poem comes between
March and June of 1859 when it was still planned to be part of a
numbered non-cluster long sequence, the fact Whitman did not give
his twelve Live Oak poems numbers in this sequence, and copied them
in a form different from other manuscripts of about this date, may
just possibly indicate some doubt in his mind whether he should
print them.<ref target="f006.20.05" n="5"><hi rend="super">5</hi></ref> If so, the doubt was
soon
removed, because within a comparatively few months he had cut the
leaves apart, separated the poems (as indicated by fragmentary
puzzling foliation) by dispersing them into some other order; and
finally, apparently just before sending them off to be set in type,
replaced the heading of the first sequence poem with the title
"Calamus-Leaves" although in fact he had composed two new calamus
poems which, in the same manner as nos. I and II of Live Oak
introduce the symbol, and by any standards should have been placed
at the beginning of the sequence as indeed they were in 1860.</p>
<p>The original continuity, if not consanguinity, of the twelve
Live Oak poems thus destroyed, Whitman's original 'sonnet' sequence
to manly love went unrecognized until the Valentine-Barrett
manuscripts became available for study.</p>

<p>Addendum: Type Sizes in the Eighteenth Century

</p><p>The following article from William Savage's <hi rend="italic">A Dictionary of the Art of Printing</hi> (London, 1841), pp. 247-248 makes it clear that, in Savage's time at least, it was normal to cast founts of titling types with the lowercase descenders kerned:
</p><p>FULL FACED LETTER. Types, in which the capitals, and the ascending letters of the lower
case, fill the whole square of the shank, so that the descending letters project beyond the bottom
of the shank.
</p><p>This clarifies a point which puzzled me when writing the note on titling types for the last volume of <hi rend="italic">Studies in Bibliography</hi> (V, 147-151). In the case of Caslon's wood letter, however, it is improbable that kerning could have been used.<lb/>
