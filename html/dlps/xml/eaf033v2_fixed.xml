                    lately been afflicted will probably form an &aelig;ra in its <lb/> history. The
                    schemes of reformation and improvement to <lb/> which they will give birth, or,
                    if no efforts of human wisdom <lb/> can avail to avert the periodical
                    visitations of this calamity, <lb/> the change in manners and population which
                    they will <lb/> produce, will be, in the highest degree, memorable. They <lb/>
                    have already supplied new and copious materials for <reg orig="reflec-|tion"
                        >reflection</reg>
                    <lb/> to the physician and the political economist. They have <lb/> not been
                    less fertile of instruction to the moral observer, <lb/> to whom they have
                    furnished new displays of the influence <lb/> of human passions and motives.</p>
                <p>Amidst the medical and political discussions which are <lb/> now afloat in the
                    community relative to this topic, the <reg orig="au-|thor">author</reg>
                    <lb/> of these remarks has ventured to methodise his own <lb/> reflections, and
                    to weave into an humble narrative, such <reg orig="in-|cidents">incidents</reg>
                    <lb/> as appeared to him most instructive and remarkable <lb/> among those which
                    came within the sphere of his own <reg orig="ob-|servation">observation</reg>.
                    <lb/> It is every one's duty to profit by all <reg orig="opportuni-|ties"
                        >opportunities</reg>
                    <lb/> of inculcating on mankind the lessons of justice and <lb/> humanity. The
                    influences of hope and fear, the trials of <lb/>
                    <pb n="iv" entity="eaf033v2_0017" pid="uva-lib:349324"/> fortitude and
                    constancy, which took place in this city, in the <lb/> autumn of 1793, have,
                    perhaps, never been exceeded in any <lb/> age. It is but just to snatch some of
                    these from oblivion, <lb/> and to deliver to posterity a brief but faithful
                    sketch of the <lb/> condition of this metropolis during that calamitous period.
                    <lb/> Men only require to be made acquainted with distress for <lb/> their
                    compassion and their charity to be awakened. He <lb/> that depicts, in lively
                    colors, the evils of disease and poverty, <lb/> performs an eminent service to
                    the sufferers, by calling <lb/> forth benevolence in those who are able to
                    afford relief, <lb/> and he who portrays examples of disinterestedness and <reg

                    notoriety and homage that <lb/> are due to it, and rouses in the spectators, the

                <p>In the following tale a particular series of adventures is <lb/> brought to a
                    close; but these are necessarily connected with <lb/> the events which happened
                    subsequent to the period here <lb/> described. These events are not less

                        Many <lb/> motives contributed to detain me, though departure was <lb/> easy
                        and commodious, and my friends were generally <reg orig="soli-|citous"
                            >solicitous</reg>
                        <lb/> for me to go. It is not my purpose to enumerate <lb/> these motives,
                        or to dwell on my present concerns and <lb/> transactions, but merely to
                        compose a narrative of some <lb/> incidents with which my situation made me
                        acquainted.</p>
                    <p>Returning one evening, somewhat later than usual, to my <lb/> own house, my
                        attention was attracted, just as I entered the <lb/> porch, by the figure of
                        a man, reclining against the wall at <lb/> a few paces distant. My sight was
                        imperfectly assisted by <lb/> a far-off lamp; but the posture in which he
                        sat, the hour, <lb/> and the place, immediately suggested the idea of one
                            <reg orig="disa-|bled">disabled</reg>
                        <lb/> by sickness. It was obvious to conclude that his <lb/> disease was
                        pestilential. This did not deter me from <reg orig="ap-|proaching"
                            >approaching</reg>
                        <lb/> and examining him more closely.</p>
                    <p>He leaned his head against the wall, his eyes were shut, <lb/> his hands
                        clasped in each other, and his body seemed to be <lb/> sustained in an
                        upright position merely by the cellar door, <lb/> against which he rested
                        his left shoulder. The lethargy <lb/> into which he was sunk, seemed
                        scarcely interrupted by my <lb/> feeling his hand and his forehead. His
                        throbbing temples <lb/> and burning skin indicated a fever, and his form,
                        already <lb/> emaciated, seemed to prove that it had not been of short <lb/>
                        duration.</p>
                    <pb n="6" entity="eaf033v2_0019" pid="uva-lib:349326"/>
                    <p>There was only one circumstance that hindered me from <lb/> forming an
                        immediate determination in what manner this <lb/> person should be treated.
                        My family consisted of my wife <lb/> and a young child. Our servant maid had
                        been seized, three <lb/> days before, by the reigning malady, and, at her
                        own request, <lb/> had been conveyed to the hospital. We ourselves enjoyed
                        <lb/> good health, and were hopeful of escaping with our lives. <lb/> Our
                        measures for this end had been cautiously taken and <lb/> carefully adhered
                        to. They did not consist in avoiding the <lb/> receptacles of infection, for
                        my office required me to go <lb/> daily into the midst of them; nor in
                        filling the house with <lb/> the exhalations of gunpowder, vinegar, or tar.
                        They <reg orig="con-|sisted">consisted</reg>
                        <lb/> in cleanliness, reasonable exercise, and wholesome <lb/> diet. Custom
                        had likewise blunted the edge of our <reg orig="appre-|hensions"
                            >apprehensions</reg>. <lb/> To take this person into my house, and
                        bestow <lb/> upon him the requisite attendance, was the scheme that first
                        <lb/> occurred to me. In this, however, the advice of my wife <lb/> was to
                        govern me.</p>
                    <p>I mentioned the incident to her. I pointed out the <reg orig="dan-|ger"
                            >danger</reg>
                        <lb/> which was to be dreaded from such an inmate. I desired <lb/> her to
                        decide with caution, and mentioned my resolution to <lb/> conform myself
                        implicitly to her decision. Should we refuse <lb/> to harbor him, we must
                        not forget that there was a hospital <lb/> to which he would, perhaps,
                        consent to be carried, and <lb/> where he would be accommodated in the best
                        manner the <lb/> times would admit.</p>
                    <p>"Nay," said she, "talk not of hospitals. At least let <lb/> him have his
                        choice. I have no fear about me, for my <lb/> part, in a case where the
                        injunctions of duty are so <reg orig="ob-|vious">obvious</reg>. <lb/> Let us
                        take the poor, unfortunate wretch into <lb/> our protection and care, and
                        leave the consequences to <lb/> Heaven."</p>
                    <p>I expected and was pleased with this proposal. I <reg orig="re-|turned"
                            >returned</reg>
                        <lb/> to the sick man, and, on rousing him from his <lb/> stupor, found him
                        still in possession of his reason. With <lb/> a candle near, I had an
                        opportunity of viewing him more <lb/> accurately.</p>
                    <p>His garb was plain, careless, and denoted rusticity. His <lb/> aspect was
                        simple and ingenuous, and his decayed visage <lb/> still retained traces of
                        uncommon but manlike beauty. He <lb/> had all the appearances of mere youth,
                        unspoiled by luxury <lb/>
                        <pb n="7" entity="eaf033v2_0020" pid="uva-lib:349327"/> and uninured to
                        misfortune. I scarcely ever beheld an <lb/> object which laid so powerful
                        and sudden a claim to my <lb/> affection and succor.</p>
                    <p>"You are sick," said I, in as cheerful a tone as I could <lb/> assume. "Cold
                        bricks and night airs are comfortless <reg orig="at-|tendants"
                            >attendants</reg>
                        <lb/> for one in your condition. Rise, I pray you, and <lb/> come into the
                        house. We will try to supply you with <reg orig="ac-|commodations"
                            >accommodations</reg>
                        <lb/> a little more suitable."</p>
                    <p>At this address he fixed his languid eyes upon me. <lb/> "What would you
                        have?" said he. "I am very well as I <lb/> am. While I breathe, which will
                        not be long, I shall breathe <lb/> with more freedom here than elsewhere.
                        Let me alone&mdash; <lb/> I am very well as I am."</p>
                    <p>"Nay," said I, "this situation is unsuitable to a sick <lb/> man. I only ask
                        you to come into my house, and receive <lb/> all the kindness that it is in
                        our power to bestow. Pluck <lb/> up courage and I will answer for your
                        recovery, provided <lb/> you submit to directions, and do as we would have
                        you. <lb/> Rise, and come along with me. We will find you a <reg
                            orig="physi-|cian">physician</reg>
                        <lb/> and a nurse, and all we ask in return is good spirits and <lb/>
                        compliance."</p>
                    <p>"Do you not know," he replied, "what my disease is? <lb/> Why should you risk
                        your safety for the sake of one, whom <lb/> your kindness cannot benefit,
                        and who has nothing to give <lb/> in return?"</p>
                    <p>There was something in the style of this remark, that <lb/> heightened my
                        prepossession in his favor, and made me <lb/> pursue my purpose with more
                        zeal. "Let us try what we <lb/> can do for you," I answered. "If we save
                        your life, we <lb/> shall have done you some service, and as for recompense,
                        <lb/> we will look to that."</p>
                    <p>It was with considerable difficulty that he was persuaded <lb/> to accept our
                        invitation. He was conducted to a chamber, <lb/> and the criticalness of his
                        case requiring unusual attention, <lb/> I spent the night at his
                        bedside.</p>
                    <p>My wife was encumbered with the care both of her infant <lb/> and her family.
                        The charming babe was in perfect health, <lb/> but her mother's constitution
                        was frail and delicate. We <lb/> simplified the household duties as much as
                        possible, but still <lb/> these duties were considerably burthensome to one
                        not used <lb/> to the performance, and luxuriously educated. The addition <lb/>
                        <pb n="8" entity="eaf033v2_0021" pid="uva-lib:349328"/> of a sick man was
                        likely to be productive of much fatigue. <lb/> My engagements would not
                        allow me to be always at <lb/> home, and the state of my patient, and the
                        remedies <reg orig="ne-|cessary">necessary</reg>
                        <lb/> to be prescribed, were attended with many noxious <lb/> and disgustful
                        circumstances. My fortune would not allow <lb/> me to hire assistance. My
                        wife, with a feeble frame and <lb/> a mind shrinking, on ordinary occasions,
                        from such offices, <lb/> with fastidious scrupulousness, was to be his only
                        or <reg orig="princi-|pal">principal</reg>
                        <lb/> nurse.</p>
                    <p>My neighbors were fervent in their well-meant zeal, and <lb/> loud in their
                        remonstrances on the imprudence and <reg orig="rash-|ness">rashness</reg>
                        <lb/> of my conduct. They called me presumptuous and <lb/> cruel in exposing
                        my wife and child, as well as myself, <lb/> to such imminent hazard, for the
                        sake of one, too, who <lb/> most probably was worthless, and whose disease
                        had <reg orig="doubt-|less">doubtless</reg>
                        <lb/> been, by negligence or mistreatment, rendered <reg orig="in-|curable"
                            >incurable</reg>.</p>
                    <p>I did not turn a deaf ear to these censurers. I was aware <lb/> of all the
                        inconveniences and perils to which I thus <reg orig="sponta-|neously"
                            >spontaneously</reg>
                        <lb/> exposed myself. No one knew better the value of <lb/> that woman whom
                        I called mine, or set a higher price upon <lb/> her life, her health, and
                        her ease. The virulence and <reg orig="activ-|ity">activity</reg>
                        <lb/> of this contagion, the dangerous condition of my patient, <lb/> and
                        the dubiousness of his character, were not forgotten by <lb/> me; but still
                        my conduct in this affair received my own <lb/> entire approbation. All
                        objections on the score of my <lb/> friend were removed by her own
                        willingness and even <reg orig="soli-|citude">solicitude</reg>
                        <lb/> to undertake the province. I had more confidence <lb/> than others in
                        the vincibility of this disease, and in the <lb/> success of those measures,
                        which we had used for our <lb/> defence against it. But, whatever were the
                        evils to accrue <lb/> to us, we were sure of one thing; namely, that the
                            <reg orig="con-|sciousness">consciousness</reg>
                        <lb/> of having neglected this unfortunate person, <lb/> would be a source
                        of more unhappiness than could <reg orig="pos-|sibly">possibly</reg>
                        <lb/> redound from the attendance and care that he would <lb/> claim.</p>
                    <p>The more we saw of him, indeed, the more did we <reg orig="con-|gratulate"
                            >congratulate</reg>
                        <lb/> ourselves on our proceeding. His torments were <lb/> acute and
                        tedious, but in the midst even of delirium, his <lb/> heart seemed to
                        overflow with gratitude, and to be actuated <lb/> by no wish but to
                        alleviate our toil and our danger. He <lb/>
                        <pb n="9" entity="eaf033v2_0022" pid="uva-lib:349329"/> made prodigious
                        exertions to perform necessary offices for <lb/> himself. He suppressed his
                        feelings and struggled to <reg orig="main-|tain">maintain</reg>
                        <lb/> a cheerful tone and countenance, that he might prevent <lb/> that
                        anxiety which the sight of his sufferings produced in us. <lb/> He was
                        perpetually furnishing reasons why his nurse should <lb/> leave him alone,
                        and betrayed dissatisfaction whenever she <lb/> entered his apartment.</p>
                    <p>In a few days, there were reasons to conclude him out of <lb/> danger; and in
                        a fortnight, nothing but exercise and <reg orig="nourish-|ment"
                            >nourishment</reg>
                        <lb/> were wanting to complete his restoration. <reg orig="Mean-|while"
                            >Meanwhile</reg>
                        <lb/> nothing was obtained from him but general <reg orig="informa-|tion"
                            >information</reg>, <lb/> that his place of abode was Chester County,
                        and that <lb/> some momentous engagement induced him to hazard his <lb/>
                        safety by coming to the city in the height of the epidemic.</p>
                    <p>He was far from being talkative. His silence seemed to <lb/> be the joint
                        result of modesty and unpleasing remembrances. <lb/> His features were
                        characterized by pathetic seriousness, and <lb/> his deportment by a gravity
                        very unusual at his age. <reg orig="Ac-|cording">According</reg>
                        <lb/> to his own representation, he was no more than <lb/> eighteen years
                        old, but the depth of his remarks indicated <lb/> a much greater advance.
                        His name was Arthur Mervyn. <lb/> He described himself as having passed his
                        life at the plough <lb/> tail and the threshing floor; as being destitute of
                        all <reg orig="scho-|lastic">scholastic</reg>
                        <lb/> instruction; and as being long since bereft of the <lb/> affectionate
                        regards of parents and kinsmen.</p>
                    <p>When questioned as to the course of life which he meant <lb/> to pursue, upon
                        his recovery, he professed himself without <lb/> any precise object. He was
                        willing to be guided by the <lb/> advice of others, and by the lights which
                        experience should <lb/> furnish. The country was open to him, and he
                        supposed <lb/> that there was no part of it in which food could not be <reg
                            orig="pur-|chased">purchased</reg>
                        <lb/> by his labor. He was unqualified, by his education, <lb/> for any
                        liberal profession. His poverty was likewise an <lb/> insuperable
                        impediment. He could afford to spend no time <lb/> in the acquisition of a
                        trade. He must labor, not for future <lb/> emolument, but for immediate
                        subsistence. The only <reg orig="pur-|suit">pursuit</reg>
                        <lb/> which his present circumstances would allow him to <lb/> adopt, was
                        that which, he was inclined to believe, was <reg orig="like-|wise"
                            >likewise</reg>
                        <lb/> the most eligible. Without doubt his experience was <lb/> slender, and
                        it seemed absurd to pronounce concerning that <lb/> of which he had no
                        direct knowledge; but so it was, he <lb/>
                        <pb n="10" entity="eaf033v2_0023" pid="uva-lib:349330"/> could not outroot
                        from his mind the persuasion that to plough, <lb/> to sow, and to reap were
                        employments most befitting a <lb/> reasonable creature, and from which the
                        truest pleasure and <lb/> the least pollution would flow. He contemplated no
                        other <lb/> scheme than to return, as soon as his health should permit,
                        <lb/> into the country, seek employment where it was to be had, <lb/> and
                        acquit himself in his engagements with fidelity and <reg orig="dili-|gence"
                            >diligence</reg>.</p>
                    <p>I pointed out to him various ways in which the city might <lb/> furnish
                        employment to one with his qualifications. He had <lb/> said that he was
                        somewhat accustomed to the pen. There <lb/> were stations in which the
                        possession of a legible hand was <lb/> all that was requisite. He might add
                        to this a knowledge <lb/> of accounts, and thereby procure himself a post in
                        some <lb/> mercantile or public office.</p>
                    <p>To this he objected, that experience had shewn him unfit <lb/> for the life
                        of a penman. This had been his chief <reg orig="oc-|cupation"
                            >occupation</reg>
                        <lb/> for a little while, and he found it wholly <reg orig="incompati-|ble"
                            >incompatible</reg>
                        <lb/> with his health. He must not sacrifice the end for the <lb/> means.
                        Starving was a disease preferable to consumption. <lb/> Besides, he labored
                        merely for the sake of living, and he <lb/> lived merely for the sake of
                        pleasure. If his tasks should <lb/> enable him to live, but at the same
                        time, bereave him of all <lb/> satisfaction, they inflicted injury and were
                        to be shunned as <lb/> worse evils than death.</p>
                    <p>I asked to what species of pleasure he alluded, with which <lb/> the business
                        of a clerk was inconsistent.</p>
                    <p>He answered, that he scarcely knew how to describe it. <lb/> He read books
                        when they came in his way. He had lighted <lb/> upon few, and, perhaps, the
                        pleasure they afforded him was <lb/> owing to their fewness; yet, he
                        confessed that, a mode of life <lb/> which entirely forbade him to read, was
                        by no means to his <lb/> taste. But this was trivial. He knew how to value
                        the <lb/> thoughts of other people, but he could not part with the <lb/>
                        privilege of observing and thinking for himself. He wanted <lb/> business
                        which would suffer at least nine tenths of his <reg orig="atten-|tion"
                            >attention</reg>
                        <lb/> to go free. If it afforded agreeable employment to that <lb/> part of
                        his attention which it applied to its own use, so much <lb/> the better; but
                        if it did not, he should not repine. He <lb/> should be content with a life
                        whose pleasures were to its <lb/> pains as nine are to one. He had tried the
                        trade of a <reg orig="copy-|ist">copyist</reg>, <lb/>
                        <pb n="11" entity="eaf033v2_0024" pid="uva-lib:349331"/> and in
                        circumstances more favorable than it was likely <lb/> he should ever again
                        have an opportunity of trying it, and <lb/> he had found that it did not
                        fulfil the requisite conditions. <lb/> Whereas the trade of ploughman was
                        friendly to health, <lb/> liberty, and pleasure.</p>
                    <p>The pestilence, if it may so be called, was now declining. <lb/> The health
                        of my young friend allowed him to breathe the <lb/> fresh air and to
                        walk.&mdash;A friend of mine, by name Wortley, <lb/> who had spent two
                        months from the city, and to whom, in <lb/> the course of a familiar
                        correspondence, I had mentioned <lb/> the foregoing particulars, returned
                        from his rural excursion. <lb/> He was posting, on the evening of the day of
                        his arrival, <lb/> with a friendly expedition, to my house, when he overtook
                        <lb/> Mervyn going in the same direction. He was surprised to <lb/> find him
                        go before him into my dwelling, and to discover, <lb/> which he speedily
                        did, that this was the youth whom I had <lb/> so frequently mentioned to
                        him. I was present at their <lb/> meeting.</p>
                    <p>There was a strange mixture in the countenance of <reg orig="Wort-|ley"
                            >Wortley</reg>, <lb/> when they were presented to each other. His <reg
                            orig="satis-|faction">satisfaction</reg>
                        <lb/> was mingled with surprise, and his surprise with <lb/> anger. Mervyn,
                        in his turn, betrayed considerable <reg orig="embar-|rassment"
                            >embarrassment</reg>. <lb/> Wortley's thoughts were too earnest on some
                        <lb/> topic to allow him to converse. He shortly made some <reg
                            orig="ex-|cuse">excuse</reg>
                        <lb/> for taking leave, and, rising, addressed himself to the <lb/> youth
                        with a request that he would walk home with him. <lb/> This invitation,
                        delivered in a tone which left it doubtful <lb/> whether a compliment or
                        menace were meant, augmented <lb/> Mervyn's confusion. He complied without
                        speaking, and <lb/> they went out together;&mdash;my wife and I were left to
                            <reg orig="com-|ment">comment</reg>
                        <lb/> upon the scene.</p>
                    <p>It could not fail to excite uneasiness. They were <reg orig="evi-|dently"
                            >evidently</reg>
                        <lb/> no strangers to each other. The indignation that <lb/> flashed from
                        the eyes of Wortley, and the trembling <reg orig="con-|sciousness"
                            >consciousness</reg>
                        <lb/> of Mervyn were unwelcome tokens. The <reg orig="for-|mer">former</reg>
                        <lb/> was my dearest friend, and venerable for his <reg orig="discern-|ment"
                            >discernment</reg>
                        <lb/> and integrity. The latter appeared to have drawn <lb/> upon himself
                        the anger and disdain of this man. We already <lb/> anticipated the shock
                        which the discovery of his <reg orig="unworthi-|ness">unworthiness</reg>
                        <lb/> would produce.</p>
                    <p>In a half hour Mervyn returned. His embarrassment <lb/>
                        <pb n="12" entity="eaf033v2_0025" pid="uva-lib:349332"/> had given place to
                        dejection. He was always serious, but <lb/> his features were now overcast
                        by the deepest gloom. The <lb/> anxiety which I felt would not allow me to
                        hesitate long.</p>
                    <p>"Arthur," said I, "something is the matter with you. <lb/> Will you not
                        disclose it to us? Perhaps you have brought <lb/> yourself into some dilemma
                        out of which we may help you <lb/> to escape. Has any thing of an unpleasant
                        nature passed <lb/> between you and Wortley?"</p>
                    <p>The youth did not readily answer. He seemed at a loss <lb/> for a suitable
                        reply. At length he said, that something <reg orig="dis-|agreeable"
                            >disagreeable</reg>
                        <lb/> had indeed passed between him and Wortley. <lb/> He had had the
                        misfortune to be connected with a man by <lb/> whom Wortley conceived
                        himself to be injured. He had <lb/> borne no part in inflicting this injury,
                        but had nevertheless <lb/> been threatened with ill treatment if he did not
                        make <reg orig="dis-|closures">disclosures</reg>
                        <lb/> which, indeed, it was in his power to make, but <lb/> which he was
                        bound, by every sanction, to withhold. This <lb/> disclosure would be of no
                        benefit to Wortley. It would <lb/> rather operate injuriously than
                        otherwise; yet it was <reg orig="endea-|vored">endeavored</reg>
                        <lb/> to be wrested from him by the heaviest menaces.&mdash; <lb/> There he
                        paused.</p>
                    <p>We were naturally inquisitive as to the scope of these <lb/> menaces; but
                        Mervyn entreated us to forbear any further <reg orig="dis-|cussion"
                            >discussion</reg>
                        <lb/> of this topic. He foresaw the difficulties to which <lb/> his silence
                        would subject him. One of its most fearful <reg orig="con-|sequences"
                            >consequences</reg>
                        <lb/> would be the loss of our good opinion. He knew <lb/> not what he had
                        to dread from the enmity of Wortley. <lb/> Mr. Wortley's violence was not
                        without excuse. It was <lb/> his mishap to be exposed to suspicions which
                        could only be <lb/> obviated by breaking his faith. But, indeed, he knew not
                        <lb/> whether any degree of explicitness would confute the charges <lb/>
                        that were made against him; whether, by trampling on his <lb/> sacred
                        promise, he should not multiply his perils instead of <lb/> lessening their
                        number. A difficult part had been assigned <lb/> to him; by much too
                        difficult for one, young, improvident, <lb/> and inexperienced as he
                        was.</p>
                    <p>Sincerity, perhaps, was the best course. Perhaps, after <lb/> having had an
                        opportunity for deliberation, he should conclude <lb/> to adopt it;
                        meanwhile he entreated permission to retire to <lb/> his chamber. He was
                        unable to exclude from his mind <lb/>
                        <pb n="13" entity="eaf033v2_0026" pid="uva-lib:349333">

                        be made the theme of conversation.</p>
                    <p>These words were accompanied with simplicity and <lb/> pathos, and with
                        tokens of unaffected distress.</p>
                    <p>"Arthur," said I, "you are master of your actions and <lb/> time in this
                        house. Retire when you please; but you will <lb/> naturally suppose us
                        anxious to dispel this mystery. <reg orig="What-|ever">Whatever</reg>

                        excite our solicitude. Wortley is not short sighted or <lb/> hasty to
                        condemn. So great is my confidence in his <reg orig="integ-|rity"
                            >integrity</reg>
                        <lb/> that I will not promise my esteem to one who has <reg

                        <lb/> lost that of Wortley. I am not acquainted with <lb/> your motives to
                        concealment, or what it is you conceal, but <lb/> take the word of one who
                        possesses that experience which <lb/> you complain of wanting, that
                        sincerity is always safest."</p>
                    <p>As soon as he had retired, my curiosity prompted me to <lb/> pay an immediate
                        visit to Wortley. I found him at home. <lb/> He was no less desirous of an
                        interview, and answered my <lb/> inquiries with as much eagerness as they
                        were made.</p>
                    <p>"You know," said he, "my disastrous connexion with <lb/> Thomas Welbeck. You
                        recollect his sudden disappearance <lb/> last July, by which I was reduced
                        to the brink of ruin. Nay, <lb/> I am, even now, far from certain that I
                        shall survive that <lb/> event. I spoke to you about the youth who lived
                        with him, <lb/> and by what means that youth was discovered to have <reg
                            orig="cross-|ed">crossed</reg>
                        <lb/> the river in his company on the night of his departure. <lb/> This is
                        that very youth.</p>
                    <p>"This will account for my emotion at meeting him at <lb/> your house; I
                        brought him out with me. His confusion <lb/> sufficiently indicated his
                        knowledge of transactions between <lb/> Welbeck and me. I questioned him as
                        to the fate of that <lb/> man. To own the truth, I expected some well
                        digested lie; <lb/> but he merely said, that he had promised secrecy on that
                        <lb/> subject, and must therefore be excused from giving me any <lb/>
                        information. I asked him if he knew, that his master, or <lb/> accomplice,
                        or whatever was his relation to him, absconded in <lb/> my debt? He answered
                        that he knew it well; but still <lb/> pleaded a promise of inviolable
                        secrecy as to his hiding <lb/> place. This conduct justly exasperated me,
                        and I treated <lb/> him with the severity which he deserved. I am half
                        ashamed <lb/>
                        <pb n="14" entity="eaf033v2_0027" pid="uva-lib:349334"/> to confess the
                        excesses of my passion; I even went so far <lb/> as to strike him. He bore
                        my insults with the utmost <reg orig="pa-|tience">patience</reg>. <lb/> No
                        doubt the young villain is well instructed in his <lb/> lesson. He knows
                        that he may safely defy my power.&mdash; <lb/> From threats I descended to
                        entreaties. I even endeavored <lb/> to wind the truth from him by artifice.
                        I promised him a <lb/> part of the debt if he would enable me to recover the
                        whole. <lb/> I offered him a considerable reward if he would merely <lb/>
                        afford me a clue by which I might trace him to his retreat; <lb/> but all
                        was insufficient. He merely put on an air of <reg orig="per-|plexity"
                            >perplexity</reg>
                        <lb/> and shook his head in token of non-compliance."</p>
                    <p>Such was my friend's account of this interview. His <lb/> suspicions were
                        unquestionably plausible; but I was disposed <lb/> to put a more favorable
                        construction on Mervyn's <reg orig="beha-|vior">behavior</reg>. <lb/> I
                        recollected the desolate and pennyless condition <lb/> in which I found him,
                        and the uniform complacency and <lb/> rectitude of his deportment for the
                        period during which we <lb/> had witnessed it. These ideas had considerable
                        influence <lb/> on my judgment, and indisposed me to follow the advice of
                        <lb/> my friend, which was to turn him forth from my doors that <lb/> very
                        might.</p>
                    <p>My wife's prepossessions were still more powerful <reg orig="advo-|cates"
                            >advocates</reg>
                        <lb/> of this youth. She would vouch, she said, before any <lb/> tribunal,
                        for his innocence; but she willingly concurred with <lb/> me in allowing him
                        the continuance of our friendship on no <lb/> other condition than that of a
                        disclosure of the truth. To <lb/> entitle ourselves to this confidence we
                        were willing to engage, <lb/> in our turn, for the observance of secrecy, so
                        far, that no <lb/> detriment should accrue from this disclosure to himself
                        or <lb/> his friend.</p>
                    <p>Next morning at breakfast, our guest appeared with a <lb/> countenance less
                        expressive of embarrassment than on the <lb/> last evening. His attention
                        was chiefly engaged by his own <lb/> thoughts, and little was said till the
                        breakfast was removed. <lb/> I then reminded him of the incidents of the
                        former day, and <lb/> mentioned that the uneasiness which thence arose to us
                        had <lb/> rather been increased than diminished by time.</p>
                    <p>"It is in your power, my young friend," continued I, <lb/> "to add still more
                        to this uneasiness, or to take it entirely <lb/> away. I had no personal
                        acquaintance with Thomas <reg orig="Wel-|beck">Welbeck</reg>. <lb/> I have
                        been informed by others that his character, <lb/>
                        <pb n="15" entity="eaf033v2_0028" pid="uva-lib:349335"/> for a certain
                        period, was respectable, but that, at length, he <lb/> contracted large
                        debts, and, instead of paying them, <reg orig="abscond-|ed">absconded</reg>.
                        <lb/> You, it seems, lived with him. On the night of his <lb/> departure you
                        are known to have accompained him across <lb/> the river, and this, it
                        seems, is the first of your re-appearance <lb/> on the stage. Welbeck's
                        conduct was dishonest. He ought <lb/> doubtless to be pursued to his asylum
                        and be compelled to <lb/> refund his winnings. You confess yourself to know
                        his <lb/> place of refuge, but urge a promise of secrecy. Know you <lb/> not
                        that to assist, or connive at the escape of this man was <lb/> wrong? To
                        have promised to favor his concealment and <lb/> impunity by silence was
                        only an aggravation of this wrong. <lb/> That, however, is past. Your youth,
                        and circumstances, <lb/> hitherto unexplained, may apologize for that
                        misconduct, <lb/> but it is certainly your duty to repair it to the utmost
                        of <lb/> your power. Think whether by disclosing what you know, <lb/> you
                        will not repair it."</p>
                    <p>"I have spent most of last night," said the youth, "in <lb/> reflecting on
                        this subject. I had come to a resolution, <reg orig="be-|fore">before</reg>

                        yet none but considerations of the highest importance would <lb/> persuade
                        me to break my promise. No injury will accrue <lb/> from my disclosure to

                        if your indulgence shall support me to <lb/> the end of a tedious but humble

                        <lb/> and considered his candor, in this respect, as an unerring <lb/> test
                        of his rectitude. She was prepared to hear and to <lb/> forgive the errors
                        of inexperience and precipitation. I did <lb/> not fully participate in her

                    <p><hi rend="small-caps">My</hi> natal soil is Chester County. My father had a

                        <lb/> and a numerous family. He has had many children, but <lb/> some defect
                        in the constitution of our mother has been fatal <lb/> to all of them but
                        me. They died successively as they <reg orig="at-|tained">attained</reg>
                        <lb/> the age of nineteen or twenty, and, since I have not <lb/> yet reached
                        that age, I may reasonably look for the same <lb/> premature fate. In the
                        spring of last year my mother <reg orig="fol-|lowed">followed</reg>
                        <lb/> her fifth child to the grave, and three months <reg

                        <lb/> died herself.</p>
                    <p>My constitution has always been frail, and, till the death <lb/> of my
                        mother, I enjoyed unlimited indulgence. I cheerfully <lb/> sustained my
                        portion of labor, for that necessity prescribed; <lb/> but the intervals
                        were always at my own disposal, and in <lb/> whatever manner I thought
                        proper to employ them, my plans <lb/> were encouraged and assisted. Fond
                        appellations, tones of <lb/> mildness, solicitous attendance when I was
                        sick, deference <lb/> to my opinions, and veneration for my talents compose

                        <lb/> and presumption of youth, and now that she is gone <lb/> my
                        compunction is awakened by a thousand recollections of <lb/> my treatment of
                        her. I was indeed guilty of no flagrant <lb/> acts of contempt or rebellion.
                        Perhaps her deportment was <lb/> inevitably calculated to instil into me a
                        froward and <reg orig="refrac-|tory">refractory</reg>
                        <lb/> spirit. My faults, however, were speedily followed by <lb/>
                        repentance, and in the midst of impatience and passion, a <lb/> look of
                        tender upbraiding from her was always sufficient to <lb/> melt me into tears
                        and make me ductile to her will. It <lb/> sorrow for her loss be an
                        atonement for the offences which <lb/> I committed during her life, ample
                        atonement has been <lb/> made.</p>
                    <p>My father is a man of slender capacity, but of a temper <lb/> easy and
                        flexible. He was sober and industrious by habit. <lb/> He was content to be
                        guided by the superior intelligence of <lb/> his wife. Under this guidance
                        he prospered; but when <lb/> that was withdrawn, his affairs soon began to
                        betray marks <lb/> of unskilfulness and negligence. My understanding, <reg
                            orig="per-|haps">perhaps</reg>, <lb/> qualified me to counsel and assist
                        my father, but I was <lb/> wholly unaccustomed to the task of
                        superintendence. <reg orig="Be-|sides">Besides</reg>, <lb/> gentleness and
                        fortitude did not descend to me from <lb/> my mother, and these were
                        indispensable attributes in a boy <lb/> who desires to dictate to his
                        grey-headed parent. Time, <lb/> perhaps, might have conferred dexterity on
                        me, or prudence <lb/> on him, had not a most unexpected event given a
                        different <lb/> direction to my views.</p>
                    <p>Betty Lawrence was a wild girl from the pine forests of <lb/> New Jersey. At
                        the age of ten years she became a bound <lb/> servant in this city, and,
                        after the expiration of her time, <lb/> came into my father's neighborhood
                        in search of <reg orig="employ-|ment">employment</reg>. <lb/> She was hired
                        in our family as milkmaid and market <lb/> woman. Her features were coarse,
                        her frame robust, her <lb/> mind totally unlettered, and her morals
                        defective in that <lb/> point in which female excellence is supposed chiefly
                        to <reg orig="con-|sist">consist</reg>. <lb/> She possessed superabundant
                        health and good humor, <lb/> and was quite a supportable companion in the
                        hay field or <lb/> the barn yard.</p>
                    <p>On the death of my mother, she was exalted to a <reg orig="some-|what"
                            >somewhat</reg>
                        <lb/> higher station. The same tasks fell to her lot; but the <lb/>
                        <pb n="18" entity="eaf033v2_0031" pid="uva-lib:349338"/> time and manner of
                        performing them were, in some degree, <lb/> submitted to her own choice. The
                        cows and the dairy were <lb/> still her province; but in this no one
                        interfered with her, or <lb/> pretended to prescribe her measures. For this
                        province she <lb/> seemed not unqualified, and as long as my father was
                        pleased <lb/> with her management, I had nothing to object.</p>
                    <p>This state of things continued, without material variation, <lb/> for several
                        months. There were appearances in my father's <lb/> deportment to Betty,
                        which excited my reflections, but not <lb/> my fears. The deference which
                        was occasionally paid to the <lb/> advice or the claims of this girl, was
                        accounted for by that <lb/> feebleness of mind which degraded my father, in
                        whatever <lb/> scene he should be placed, to be the tool of others. I had
                        <lb/> no conception that her claims extended beyond a temporary <lb/> or
                        superficial gratification.</p>
                    <p>At length, however, a visible change took place in her <reg orig="man-|ners"
                            >manners</reg>. <lb/> A scornful affectation and awkward dignity began
                        to <lb/> be assumed. A greater attention was paid to dress, which <lb/> was
                        of gayer hues and more fashionable texture. I rallied <lb/> her on these
                        tokens of a sweetheart, and amused myself with <lb/> expatiating to her on
                        the qualifications of her lover. A <lb/> clownish fellow was frequently her
                        visitant. His attentions <lb/> did not appear to be discouraged. He
                        therefore was readily <lb/> supposed to be the man. When pointed out as the
                        favorite, <lb/> great resentment was expressed, and obscure insinuations
                        <lb/> were made that her aim was not quite so low as that. These <lb/>
                        denials I supposed to be customary on such occasions, and <lb/> considered
                        the continuance of his visits as a sufficient <reg orig="confu-|tation"
                            >confutation</reg>
                        <lb/> of them.</p>
                    <p>I frequently spoke of Betty, her newly acquired dignity, <lb/> and of the
                        probable cause of her change of manners to my <lb/> father. When this theme
                        was started, a certain coldness <lb/> and reserve overspread his features.
                        He dealt in <reg orig="monosylla-|bles">monosyllables</reg>
                        <lb/> and either labored to change the subject or made some <lb/> excuse for
                        leaving me. This behaviour, though it <reg orig="occasion-|ed"
                            >occasioned</reg>
                        <lb/> surprise, was never very deeply reflected on. My father <lb/> was old,
                        and the mournful impressions which were made upon <lb/> him by the death of
                        his wife, the lapse of almost half a year <lb/> seemed scarcely to have
                        weakened. Betty had chosen her <lb/> partner, and I was in daily expectation
                        of receiving a <reg orig="sum-|mons">summons</reg>
                        <lb/> to the wedding.</p>
                    <pb n="19" entity="eaf033v2_0032" pid="uva-lib:349339"/>
                    <p>One afternoon this girl dressed herself in the gayest <reg orig="man-|ner"
                            >manner</reg>
                        <lb/> and seemed making preparations for some momentous <lb/> ceremony. My
                        father had directed me to put the horse to the <lb/> chaise. On my inquiring
                        whither he was going, he <reg orig="answer-|ed">answered</reg>
                        <lb/> me, in general terms, that he had some business at a few <lb/> miles
                        distance. I offered to go in his stead, but he said that <lb/> was
                        impossible. I was proceeding to ascertain the <reg orig="possibil-|ity"
                            >possibility</reg>
                        <lb/> of this when he left me to go to a field where his <reg
                            orig="work-|men">workmen</reg>
                        <lb/> were busy, directing me to inform him when the chaise <lb/> was ready,
                        to supply his place, while absent, in overlooking <lb/> the workmen.</p>
                    <p>This office was performed; but before I called him from <lb/> the field I
                        exchanged a few words with the milkmaid, who <lb/> sat on a bench, in all
                        the primness of expectation, and decked <lb/> with the most gaudy plumage. I
                        rated her imaginary lover <lb/> for his tardiness, and vowed eternal hatred
                        to them both for <lb/> not making me a bride's attendant. She listened to me
                        with <lb/> an air in which embarrassment was mingled sometimes with <lb/>
                        exultation, and sometimes with malice. I left her at length, <lb/> and
                        returned to the house not till a late hour. As soon as I <lb/> entered, my
                        father presented Betty to me as his wife, and <lb/> desired she might
                        receive that treatment from me which was <lb/> due to a mother.</p>
                    <p>It was not till after repeated and solemn declarations from <lb/> both of
                        them that I was prevailed upon to credit this event. <lb/> Its effect upon
                        my feelings may be easily conceived. I <lb/> knew the woman to be rude,
                        ignorant, and licentious. Had <lb/> I suspected this event I might have
                        fortified my father's <lb/> weakness and enabled him to shun the gulf to
                        which he was <lb/> tending; but my presumption had been careless of the <reg
                            orig="dan-|ger">danger</reg>. <lb/> To think that such a one should take
                        the place of <lb/> my revered mother was intolerable.</p>
                    <p>To treat her in any way not squaring with her real merits; <lb/> to hinder
                        anger and scorn from rising at the sight of her in <lb/> her new condition,
                        was not in my power. To be degraded <lb/> to the rank of her servant, to
                        become the sport of her malice <lb/> and her artifices was not to be
                        endured. I had no <reg orig="inde-|pendent">independent</reg>
                        <lb/> provision; but I was the only child of my father, <lb/> and had
                        reasonably hoped to succeed to his patrimony. On <lb/> this hope I had built
                        a thousand agreeable visions. I had <lb/> meditated innumerable projects
                        which the possession of this <lb/>
                        <pb n="20" entity="eaf033v2_0033" pid="uva-lib:349340"/> estate would enable
                        me to execute. I had no wish beyond <lb/> the trade of agriculture, and
                        beyond the opulence which a <lb/> hundred acres would give.</p>
                    <p>These visions were now at an end. No doubt her own <lb/> interest would be,
                        to this woman, the supreme law, and this <lb/> would be considered as
                        irreconcilably hostile to mine. My <lb/> father would easily be moulded to
                        her purpose, and that act <lb/> easily extorted from him which should reduce
                        me to <reg orig="beg-|gary">beggary</reg>. <lb/> She had a gross and
                        perverse taste. She had a <reg orig="nu-|merous">numerous</reg>
                        <lb/> kindred, indigent and hungry. On these his <reg orig="sub-|stance"
                            >substance</reg>
                        <lb/> would speedily be lavished. Me she hated, because <lb/> she was
                        conscious of having injured me, because she knew <lb/> that I held her in
                        contempt, and because I had detected her <lb/> in an illicit intercourse
                        with the son of a neighbor.</p>
                    <p>The house in which I lived was no longer my own, nor <lb/> even my father's.
                        Hitherto I had thought and acted in it <lb/> with the freedom of a master,
                        but now I was become, in <lb/> my own conceptions, an alien and an enemy to
                        the roof <reg orig="un-|der">under</reg>
                        <lb/> which I was born. Every tie which had bound me to <lb/> it was
                        dissolved or converted into something which repelled <lb/> me to a distance
                        from it. I was a guest whose presence <lb/> was borne with anger and
                        impatience.</p>
                    <p>I was fully impressed with the necessity of removal, but <lb/> I knew not
                        whither to go, or what kind of subsistence to <lb/> seek. My father had been
                        a Scottish emigrant, and had no <lb/> kindred on this side of the ocean. My
                        mother's family <lb/> lived in New Hampshire, and long separation had <reg
                            orig="extin-|guished">extinguished</reg>
                        <lb/> all the rights of relationship in her offspring. <reg orig="Till-|ing"
                            >Tilling</reg>
                        <lb/> the earth was my only profession, and to profit by my <lb/> skill in
                        it, it would be necessary to become a day-laborer in <lb/> the service of
                        strangers; but this was a destiny to which I, <lb/> who had so long enjoyed
                        the pleasures of independence and <lb/> command, could not suddenly
                        reconcile myself. It occurred <lb/> to me that the city might afford me an
                        asylum. A short day's <lb/> journey would transport me into it. I had been
                        there twice <lb/> or thrice in my life, but only for a few hours each time.
                        I <lb/> knew not a human face, and was a stranger to its modes <lb/> and
                        dangers. I was qualified for no employment, <reg orig="compati-|ble"
                            >compatible</reg>
                        <lb/> with a town life, but that of the pen. This, indeed, <lb/> had ever
                        been a favorite tool with me, and though it may <lb/> appear somewhat
                        strange, it is no less true that I had had <lb/>
                        <pb n="21" entity="eaf033v2_0034" pid="uva-lib:349341"/> nearly as much
                        practice at the quill as at the mattock. But <lb/> the sum of my skill lay
                        in tracing distinct characters. I had <lb/> used it merely to transcribe
                        what others had written, or to <lb/> give form to my own conceptions.
                        Whether the city would <lb/> afford me employment, as a mere copyist,
                        sufficiently <reg orig="lucra-|tive">lucrative</reg>, <lb/> was a point on
                        which I possessed no means of <reg orig="informa-|tion"
                        >information</reg>.</p>
                    <p>My determination was hastened by the conduct of my <lb/> new mother. My
                        conjectures as to the course she would <lb/> pursue with regard to me had
                        not been erroneous. My <lb/> father's deportment, in a short time, grew
                        sullen and austere. <lb/> Directions were given in a magisterial tone, and
                        any <reg orig="remiss-|ness">remissness</reg>
                        <lb/> in the execution of his orders, was rebuked with an <lb/> air of
                        authority. At length these rebukes were followed by <lb/> certain
                        intimations that I was now old enough to provide for <lb/> myself; that it
                        was time to think of some employment by <lb/> which I might secure a
                        livelihood; that it was a shame for <lb/> me to spend my youth in idleness;
                        that what he had gained <lb/> was by his own labor; and I must be indebted
                        for my living <lb/> to the same source.</p>
                    <p>These hints were easily understood. At first, they excited <lb/> indignation
                        and grief. I knew the source whence they <lb/> sprung, and was merely able
                        to suppress the utterance of <lb/> my feelings in her presence. My looks,
                        however, were <lb/> abundantly significant, and my company became hourly
                        <lb/> more insupportable. Abstracted from these considerations, <lb/> my
                        father's remonstrances were not destitute of weight. He <lb/> gave me being,
                        but sustenance ought surely to be my own <lb/> gift. In the use of that for
                        which he had been indebted to <lb/> his own exertions, he might reasonably
                        consult his own <lb/> choice. He assumed no control over me; he merely did
                        <lb/> what he would with his own, and so far from fettering my <lb/>
                        liberty, he exhorted me to use it for my own benefit, and to <lb/> make
                        provision for myself.</p>
                    <p>I now reflected that there were other manual occupations <lb/> besides that
                        of the plough. Among these none had fewer <lb/> disadvantages than that of
                        carpenter or cabinet maker. I <lb/> had no knowledge of this art; but
                        neither custom, nor law, <lb/> nor the impenetrableness of the mystery
                        required me to <lb/> serve a seven years' apprenticeship to it. A master in
                        this <lb/> trade might possibly be persuaded to take me under his <lb/>
                        <pb n="22" entity="eaf033v2_0035" pid="uva-lib:349342"/> tuition; two or
                        three years would suffice to give me the <lb/> requisite skill. Meanwhile my
                        father would, perhaps, <reg orig="con-|sent">consent</reg>
                        <lb/> to bear the cost of my maintenance. Nobody could <lb/> live upon less
                        than I was willing to do.</p>
                    <p>I mentioned these ideas to my father; but he merely <reg orig="com-|mended"
                            >commended</reg>
                        <lb/> my intentions without offering to assist me in the <lb/> execution of
                        them. He had full employment, he said, for <lb/> all the profits of his
                        ground. No doubt if I would bind <lb/> myself to serve four or five years,
                        my master would be at <lb/> the expense of my subsistence. Be that as it
                        would, I <lb/> must look for nothing from him. I had shewn very little <lb/>
                        regard for his happiness; I had refused all marks of respect <lb/> to a
                        woman who was entitled to it from her relation to him. <lb/> He did not see
                        why he should treat as a son one who <reg orig="re-|fused">refused</reg>
                        <lb/> what was due to him as a father. He thought it right <lb/> that I
                        should henceforth maintain myself. He did not want <lb/> my services on the
                        farm, and the sooner I quitted his house <lb/> the better.</p>
                    <p>I retired from this conference with a resolution to follow <lb/> the advice
                        that was given. I saw that henceforth I must be <lb/> my own protector, and
                        wondered at the folly that detained me <lb/> so long under his roof. To
                        leave it was now become <reg orig="indis-|pensable">indispensable</reg>,
                        <lb/> and there could be no reason for delaying my <reg orig="de-|parture"
                            >departure</reg>
                        <lb/> for a single hour. I determined to bend my course <lb/> to the city.
                        The scheme foremost in my mind was to <reg orig="ap-|prentice"
                            >apprentice</reg>
                        <lb/> myself to some mechanical trade. I did not <reg orig="over-|look"
                            >overlook</reg>
                        <lb/> the evils of constraint and the dubiousness as to the <lb/> character
                        of the master I should choose. I was not without <lb/> hopes that accident
                        would suggest a different expedient, and <lb/> enable me to procure an
                        immediate subsistence without <reg orig="for-|feiting">forfeiting</reg>
                        <lb/> my liberty.</p>
                    <p>I determined to commence my journey the next <reg orig="morn-|ing"
                            >morning</reg>. <lb/> No wonder the prospect of so considerable a change
                        <lb/> in my condition should deprive me of sleep. I spent the <lb/> night
                        ruminating on the future, and in painting to my fancy <lb/> the adventures
                        which I should be likely to meet. The <reg orig="fore-|sight"
                            >foresight</reg>
                        <lb/> of man is in proportion to his knowledge. No wonder <lb/> that in my
                        state of profound ignorance, not the faintest <reg orig="pre-|conception"
                            >preconception</reg>
                        <lb/> should be formed of the events that really befel <lb/> me. My temper
                        was inquisitive, but there was nothing in <lb/> the scene to which I was
                        going from which my curiosity <reg orig="ex-|pected">expected</reg>
                        <lb/>
                        <pb n="23" entity="eaf033v2_0036" pid="uva-lib:349343"/> to derive
                        gratification. Discords and evil smells, <lb/> unsavory food, unwholesome
                        labor, and irksome companions, <lb/> were, in my opinion, the unavoidable
                        attendants of a city,</p>
                    <p>My best clothes were of the homliest texture and shape. <lb/> My whole stock
                        of linen consisted of three check shirts. <lb/> Part of my winter evening's
                        employment, since the death of <lb/> my mother, consisted in knitting my own
                        stockings. Of these <lb/> I had three pair, one of which I put on, and the
                        rest I formed, <lb/> together with two shirts, into a bundle. Three quarter

                        <lb/> pieces composed my whole fortune in money.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="small-caps">I rose</hi> at the dawn, and without asking or
                        bestowing a <lb/> blessing, sallied forth into the high road to the city,
                        which <lb/> passed near the house. I left nothing behind, the loss of <lb/>
                        which I regretted. I had purchased most of my own books <lb/> with the
                        product of my own separate industry, and their <lb/> number being, of
                        course, small, I had, by incessant <reg orig="applica-|tion"
                            >application</reg>, <lb/> gotten the whole of them by rote. They had
                        ceased, <lb/> therefore, to be of any further use. I left them, without
                        <lb/> reluctance, to the fate for which I knew them to be <reg
                            orig="reserv-|ed">reserved</reg>, <lb/> that of affording food and
                        habitation to mice.</p>
                    <p>I trod this unwonted path with all the fearlessness of <lb/> youth. In spite
                        of the motives to despondency and <reg orig="appre-|hension"
                            >apprehension</reg>, <lb/> incident to my state, my heels were light and
                        my <lb/> heart joyous. "Now," said I, "I am mounted into man. <lb/> I must
                        build a name and a fortune for myself. Strange if <lb/> this intellect and
                        these hands will not supply me with an <lb/> honest livelihood. I will try
                        the city in the first place; but <lb/> if that should fail, resources are
                        still left to me. I will <reg orig="re-|sume">resume</reg>

                    <p>I had proceeded some miles on my journey, when I began <lb/> to feel the
                        inroads of hunger. I might have stopped at any <lb/> farm-house, and have
                        breakfasted for nothing. It was <reg orig="pru-|dent">prudent</reg>
                        <lb/> to husband, with the utmost care, my slender stock; but <lb/> I felt
                        reluctance to beg as long as I had the means of buying, <lb/>
                        <pb n="24" entity="eaf033v2_0037" pid="uva-lib:349344"/> and I imagined,
                        that coarse bread and a little milk would <lb/> cost little even at a
                        tavern, when any farmer was willing to <lb/> bestow them for nothing. My
                        resolution was farther <reg orig="influ-|enced">influenced</reg>
                        <lb/> by the appearance of a sign-post. What excuse could <lb/> I make for
                        begging a breakfast with an inn at hand and silver <lb/> in my pocket?</p>
                    <p>I stopped, accordingly, and breakfasted. The landlord <lb/> was remarkably
                        attentive and obliging, but his bread was <lb/> stale, his milk sour, and
                        his cheese the greenest imaginable. <lb/> I disdained to animadvert on these
                        defects, naturally <reg orig="sup-|posing">supposing</reg>
                        <lb/> that his house could furnish no better.</p>
                    <p>Having finished my meal, I put, without speaking, one of <lb/> my pieces into
                        his hand. This deportment I conceived to <lb/> be highly becoming, and to
                        indicate a liberal and manly <lb/> spirit. I always regarded with contempt a
                        scrupulous <reg orig="ma-|ker">maker</reg>
                        <lb/> of bargains. He received the money with a <reg orig="complai-|sant"
                            >complaisant</reg>
                        <lb/> obeisance. "Right," said he. "<hi rend="italic">Just</hi> the money,
                        Sir. <lb/> You are on foot, Sir. A pleasant way of travelling, Sir. I <lb/>
                        wish you a good day, Sir."&mdash;So saying he walked away.</p>
                    <p>This proceeding was wholly unexpected. I conceived <lb/> myself entitled to
                        at least three-fourths of it in change. The <lb/> first impulse was to call
                        him back, and contest the equity of <lb/> his demand, but a moment's
                        reflection shewed me the <reg orig="ab-|surdity">absurdity</reg>
                        <lb/> of such conduct. I resumed my journey with spirits <lb/> somewhat
                        depressed. I have heard of voyagers and <reg orig="wan-|derers"
                            >wanderers</reg>
                        <lb/> in deserts, who were willing to give a casket of gems <lb/> for a cup
                        of cold water. I had not supposed my own <reg orig="con-|dition"

                        <lb/> to be, in any respect, similar; yet I had just given one <lb/> third
                        of my estate for a breakfast.</p>
                    <p>I stopped at noon at another inn. I counted on <reg orig="purchas-|ing"
                            >purchasing</reg>
                        <lb/> a dinner for the same price, since I meant to content <lb/> myself
                        with the same fare. A large company was just <reg orig="sit-|ting"
                            >sitting</reg>
                        <lb/> down to a smoking banquet. The landlord invited me <lb/> to join them.
                        I took my place at the table, but was <reg orig="fur-|nished"
                            >furnished</reg>
                        <lb/> with bread and milk. Being prepared to depart, I <lb/> took him aside.
                        "What is to pay?" said I.&mdash;"Did you <lb/> drink any thing,
                        Sir?"&mdash;"Certainly. I drank the milk <lb/> which was
                        furnished."&mdash;"But any liquors, Sir?"&mdash;"No."</p>
                    <p>He deliberated a moment and then assuming an air of <lb/> disinterestedness,
                        "'Tis our custom to charge dinner and <lb/>

                        dinner is half a dollar, Sir."</p>
                    <p>He had no leisure to attend to my fluctuations. After <lb/> debating with
                        myself on what was to be done, I concluded <lb/> that compliance was best,
                        and leaving the money at the bar, <lb/> resumed my way.</p>
                    <p>I had not performed more than half my journey, yet my <lb/> purse was
                        entirely exhausted. This was a specimen of the <lb/> cost incurred by living
                        at an inn. If I entered the city, a <lb/> tavern must, at least for some
                        time, be my abode, but I had <lb/> not a farthing remaining to defray my
                        charges. My father <lb/> had formerly entertained a boarder for a dollar per
                        week, <lb/> and, in a case of need, I was willing to subsist upon coarser
                        <lb/> fare, and lie on a harder bed than those with which our <lb/> guest
                        had been supplied. These facts had been the <reg orig="found-|ation"
                            >foundation</reg>
                        <lb/> of my negligence on this occasion.</p>
                    <p>What was now to be done? To return to my paternal <lb/> mansion was
                        impossible. To relinquish my design of <reg orig="en-|tering">entering</reg>
                        <lb/> the city and to seek a temporary asylum, if not <reg
                            orig="per-|manent">permanent</reg>
                        <lb/> employment, at some one of the plantations within <lb/> view, was the
                        most obvious expedient. These deliberations <lb/> did not slacken my pace. I
                        was almost unmindful of my <lb/> way, when I found I had passed Schuylkill
                        at the upper <lb/> bridge. I was now within the precincts of the city and
                        night <lb/> was hastening. It behoved me to come to a speedy <reg
                            orig="de-|cision">decision</reg>.</p>
                    <p>Suddenly I recollected that I had not paid the customary <lb/> toll at the
                        bridge; neither had I money wherewith to pay it. <lb/> A demand of payment
                        would have suddenly arrested my <lb/> progress; and so slight an incident
                        would have precluded <lb/> that wonderful destiny to which I was reserved.
                        The <reg orig="ob-|stacle">obstacle</reg>
                        <lb/> that would have hindered my advance, now prevented <lb/> my return.
                        Scrupulous honesty did not require me to turn <lb/> back and awaken the
                        vigilance of the toll gatherer. I had <lb/> nothing to pay, and by returning
                        I should only double my <lb/> debt. "Let it stand," said I, "where it does.
                        All that <lb/> honor enjoins is to pay when I am able."</p>
                    <p>I adhered to the cross ways, till I reached Market-street. <lb/> Night had
                        fallen, and a triple row of lamps presented a <lb/> spectacle enchanting and
                        new. My personal cares were, <lb/>
                        <pb n="26" entity="eaf033v2_0039" pid="uva-lib:349346"/> for a time, lost in
                        the tumultuous sensations with which I <lb/> was now engrossed. I had never
                        visited the city at this <lb/> hour. When my last visit was paid I was a
                        mere child. <lb/> The novelty which environed every object was, therefore,
                        <lb/> nearly absolute. I proceeded with more cautious steps, but <lb/> was
                        still absorbed in attention to passing objects. I reached <lb/> the market
                        house, and, entering it, indulged myself in new <lb/> delight and new
                        wonder.</p>
                    <p>I need not remark that our ideas of magnificence and <lb/> splendor are
                        merely comparative; yet you may be prompted <lb/> to smile when I tell you
                        that, in walking through this avenue, <lb/> I, for a moment, conceived
                        myself transported to the hall <lb/> "pendent with many a row of starry
                        lamps and blazing <reg orig="cres-|cents">crescents</reg>
                        <lb/> fed by naptha and asphaltos." That this transition <lb/> from my
                        homely and quiet retreat, had been effected in so <lb/> few hours, wore the
                        aspect of miracle or magic.</p>
                    <p>I proceeded from one of these buildings to another, till <lb/> I reached
                        their termination in Front street. Here my <reg orig="pro-|gress"
                            >progress</reg>
                        <lb/> was checked, and I sought repose to my weary <lb/> limbs by seating
                        myself on a stall. No wonder some <reg orig="fa-|tigue">fatigue</reg>
                        <lb/> was felt by me, accustomed as I was to strenuous <reg
                            orig="ex-|ertions">exertions</reg>, <lb/> since, exclusive of the
                        minutes spent at breakfast <lb/> and dinner, I had travelled fifteen hours
                        and forty five miles.</p>
                    <p>I began now to reflect, with some earnestness, on my <lb/> condition. I was a
                        stranger, friendless, and moneyless. I <lb/> was unable to purchase food and
                        shelter, and was wholly <lb/> unused to the business of begging. Hunger was
                        the only <lb/> serious inconvenience to which I was immediately exposed.
                        <lb/> I had no objection to spend the night in the spot where I <lb/> then
                        sat. I had no fear that my visions would be troubled by <lb/> the officers
                        of police. It was no crime to be without a home; <lb/> but how should I
                        supply my present cravings and the <reg orig="crav-|ings">cravings</reg>
                        <lb/> of tomorrow?</p>
                    <p>At length it occurred to me that one of our country <reg orig="neigh-|bors"
                            >neighbors</reg>
                        <lb/> was probably at this time in the city. He kept a store <lb/> as well
                        as cultivated a farm. He was a plain and well <lb/> meaning man, and should
                        I be so fortunate as to meet him, <lb/> his superior knowledge of the city
                        might be of essential <lb/> benefit to me in my present forlorn
                        circumstances. His <lb/> generosity might likewise induce him to lend me so
                        much <lb/> as would purchase one meal. I had formed the resolution <lb/>
                        <pb n="27" entity="eaf033v2_0040" pid="uva-lib:349347"/> to leave the city
                        next day and was astonished at the folly <lb/> that had led me into it; but,
                        meanwhile, my physical wants <lb/> must be supplied.</p>
                    <p>Where should I look for this man? In the course of <reg orig="con-|versation"
                            >conversation</reg>
                        <lb/> I recollected him to have referred to the place of <lb/> his temporary
                        abode. It was an inn, but the sign or the <lb/> name of the keeper, for
                        sometime withstood all my efforts <lb/> to recall them.</p>
                    <p>At length I lighted on the last. It was Lesher's tavern. <lb/> I immediately
                        set out in search of it. After many inquiries <lb/> I at last arrived at the
                        door. I was preparing to enter the <lb/> house when I perceived that my
                        bundle was gone. I had <lb/> left it on the stall where I had been sitting.
                        People were <lb/> perpetually passing to and fro. It was scarcely possible
                        not <lb/> to have been noticed. No one that observed it would fail <lb/> to
                        make it his prey. Yet it was of too much value to me, <lb/> to allow me to
                        be governed by a bare probability. I <reg orig="re-|solved">resolved</reg>
                        <lb/> to lose not a moment in returning.</p>
                    <p>With some difficulty I retraced my steps, but the bundle <lb/> had
                        disappeared. The clothes were, in themselves, of <lb/> small value, but they
                        constituted the whole of my wardrobe; <lb/> and I now reflected that they
                        were capable of being <reg orig="trans-|muted">transmuted</reg>, <lb/> by
                        the pawn or sale of them, into food. There <lb/> were other wretches as
                        indigent as I was, and I consoled <lb/> myself by thinking that my shirts
                        and stockings might <reg orig="fur-|nish">furnish</reg>
                        <lb/> a seasonable covering to their nakedness; but there <lb/> was a relic
                        concealed within this bundle, the loss of which <lb/> could scarcely be
                        endured by me. It was the portrait of <lb/> a young man who died three years
                        ago at my father's house, <lb/> drawn by his own hand.</p>
                    <p>He was discovered one morning in the orchard with many <lb/> marks of
                        insanity upon him. His air and dress bespoke <lb/> some elevation of rank
                        and fortune. My mother's <reg orig="com-|passion">compassion</reg>
                        <lb/> was excited, and, as his singularities were harmless, <lb/> an asylum
                        was afforded him, though he was unable to pay <lb/> for it. He was
                        constantly declaiming, in an incoherent <lb/> manner, about some mistress
                        who had proved faithless. <lb/> His speeches seemed, however, like the
                        rantings of an <lb/> actor, to be rehearsed by rote or for the sake of
                        exercise. <lb/> He was totally careless of his person and health, and by
                        <lb/> repeated negligences of this kind, at last contracted a fever <lb/>
                        <pb n="28" entity="eaf033v2_0041" pid="uva-lib:349348"/> of which he
                        speedily died. The name which he assumed <lb/> was Clavering.</p>
                    <p>He gave no distinct account of his family, but stated in <lb/> loose terms,
                        that they were residents in England, high born <lb/> and wealthy. That they
                        had denied him the woman whom <lb/> he loved and banished him to America,
                        under penalty of <lb/> death if he should dare to return, and that they had
                        refused <lb/> him all means of subsistence in a foreign land. He predicted,
                        <lb/> in his wild and declamatory way, his own death. He was <lb/> very
                        skilful at the pencil, and drew this portrait a short time <lb/> before his
                        dissolution, presented it to me, and charged me to <lb/> preserve it in
                        remembrance of him. My mother loved the <lb/> youth because he was amiable
                        and unfortunate, and chiefly <lb/> because she fancied a very powerful
                        resemblance between <lb/> his countenance and mine. I was too young to build
                            <reg orig="affec-|tion">affection</reg>
                        <lb/> on any rational foundation. I loved him, for whatever <lb/> reason,
                        with an ardor unusual at my age, and which this <lb/> portrait had
                        contributed to prolong and to cherish.</p>
                    <p>In thus finally leaving my home, I was careful not to leave <lb/> this
                        picture behind. I wrapt it in paper in which a few <lb/> elegiac stanzas
                        were inscribed in my own hand, and with <lb/> my utmost elegance of
                        penmanship. I then placed it in a <lb/> leathern case, which, for greater
                        security, was deposited in <lb/> the centre of my bundle. It will occur to
                        you, perhaps, that <lb/> it would be safer in some fold or pocket of the
                        clothes which <lb/> I wore. I was of a different opinion and was now to
                        endure <lb/> the penalty of my error.</p>
                    <p>It was in vain to heap execrations on my negligence, or to <lb/> consume the
                        little strength left to me in regrets. I returned <lb/> once more to the
                        tavern and made inquiries for Mr. Capper, <lb/> the person whom I have just
                        mentioned as my father's <reg orig="neigh-|bor">neighbor</reg>. <lb/> I was
                        informed that Capper was now in town; that <lb/> he had lodged, on the last
                        night, at this house; that he had <lb/> expected to do the same to night,
                        but a gentleman had called <lb/> ten minutes ago, whose invitation to lodge
                        with him to night <lb/> had been accepted. They had just gone out together.
                        <lb/> Who, I asked, was the gentleman? The landlord had no <lb/> knowledge
                        of him; he knew neither his place of abode nor <lb/> his name. Was Mr.
                        Capper expected to return hither in <lb/> the morning? No, he had heard the
                        stranger propose to <lb/>
                        <pb n="29" entity="eaf033v2_0042" pid="uva-lib:349349">

                        </pb> Mr. Capper to go with him into the country tomorrow, and <lb/> Mr.
                        Capper, he believed, had assented.</p>
                    <p>This disappointment was peculiarly severe. I had lost, <lb/> by my own
                        negligence, the only opportunity that would <lb/> offer of meeting my
                        friend. Had even the recollection of <lb/> my loss been postponed for three
                        minutes, I should have <lb/> entered the house, and a meeting would have
                        been secured. <lb/> I could discover no other expedient to obviate the
                        present <lb/> evil. My heart began now, for the first time, to droop. I
                        <lb/> looked back, with nameless emotions, on the days of my <lb/> infancy.
                        I called up the image of my mother. I reflected <lb/> on the infatuation of
                        my surviving parent, and the usurpation <lb/> of the detestable Betty with
                        horror. I viewed myself as the <lb/> most calamitous and desolate of human
                        beings.</p>
                    <p>At this time I was sitting in the common room. There <lb/> were others in the
                        same apartment, lounging, or whistling, <lb/> or singing. I noticed them
                        not, but leaning my head upon <lb/> my hand, I delivered myself up to
                        painful and intense <reg orig="medi-|tation">meditation</reg>. <lb/> From
                        this I was roused by some one placing himself <lb/> on the bench near me and
                        addressing me thus; "Pray Sir, <lb/> if you will excuse me, who was the
                        person whom you were <lb/> looking for just now? Perhaps I can give you the
                            <reg orig="informa-|tion">information</reg>
                        <lb/> you want. If I can, you will be very welcome to it." <lb/> I fixed my
                        eyes with some eagerness on the person that <lb/> spoke. He was a young man,
                        expensively and fashionably <lb/> dressed, whose mien was considerably
                        prepossessing, and <lb/> whose countenance bespoke some portion of
                        discernment. <lb/> I described to him the man whom I sought. "I am in search
                        <lb/> of the same man myself," said he, "but I expect to meet <lb/> him
                        here. He may lodge elsewhere, but he promised to <lb/> meet me here at half
                        after nine. I have no doubt he will <lb/> fulfil his promise, so that you
                        will meet the gentleman."</p>
                    <p>I was highly gratified by this information, and thanked <lb/> my informant
                        with some degree of warmth. My gratitude <lb/> he did not notice, but
                        continued; "In order to beguile <reg orig="ex-|pectation">expectation</reg>,
                        <lb/> I have ordered supper; will you do me the favor <lb/> to partake with
                        me, unless indeed you have supped already?" <lb/> I was obliged, somewhat
                        awkwardly, to decline his <reg orig="invita-|tion">invitation</reg>, <lb/>
                        conscious as I was that the means of payment were not <lb/> in my power. He
                        continued however to urge my <reg orig="compli-|ance">compliance</reg>, <lb/>
                        <pb n="30" entity="eaf033v2_0043" pid="uva-lib:349350"/> till at length it
                        was, though reluctantly, yielded. My <lb/> chief motive was the certainty of
                        seeing Capper.</p>
                    <p>My new acquaintance was exceedingly conversible, but <lb/> his conversation
                        was chiefly characterized by frankness and <lb/> good humor. My reserves
                        gradually diminished, and I <lb/> ventured to inform him, in general terms,
                        of my former <reg orig="con-|dition">condition</reg>
                        <lb/> and present views. He listened to my details with <lb/> seeming
                        attention, and commented on them with some <lb/> judiciousness. His
                        statements, however, tended to <reg orig="discour-|age">discourage</reg>
                        <lb/> me from remaining in the city.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile the hour passed and Capper did not appear. <lb/> I noticed this
                        circumstance to him with no little solicitude. <lb/> He said that possibly
                        he might have forgotten or neglected <lb/> his engagement. His affair was
                        not of the highest <reg orig="impor-|tance">importance</reg>, <lb/> and
                        might be readily postponed to a future <reg orig="oppor-|tunity"
                            >opportunity</reg>. <lb/> He perceived that my vivacity was greatly
                        damped <lb/> by this intelligence. He importuned me to disclose the <lb/>
                        cause. He made himself very merry with my distress, <lb/> when it was at
                        length discovered. As to the expense on <lb/> supper, I had partaken of it
                        at his invitation, he therefore <lb/> should of course be charged with it.
                        As to lodging, he had <lb/> a chamber and a bed which he would insist upon
                        my sharing <lb/> with him.</p>
                    <p>My faculties were thus kept upon the stretch of wonder. <lb/> Every new act
                        of kindness in this man surpassed the fondest <lb/> expectation that I had
                        formed. I saw no reason why I <lb/> should be treated with benevolence. I
                        should have acted in <lb/> the same manner if placed in the same
                        circumstances; yet <lb/> it appeared incongruous and inexplicable. I know
                        whence <lb/> my ideas of human nature were derived. They certainly <lb/>
                        were not the offspring of my own feelings. These would <lb/> have taught me
                        that interest and duty were blended in every <lb/> act of generosity.</p>
                    <p>I did not come into the world without my scruples and <lb/> suspicions. I was
                        more apt to impute kindnesses to sinister <lb/> and hidden than to obvious
                        and laudable motives. I paused <lb/> to reflect upon the possible designs of
                        this person. What <lb/> end could be served by this behavior? I was no
                        subject of <lb/> violence or fraud. I had neither trinket nor coin to <reg
                            orig="stimu-|late">stimulate</reg>
                        <lb/> the treachery of others. What was offered was merely <lb/> lodging for
                        the night. Was this an act of such transcendent <lb/>
                        <pb n="31" entity="eaf033v2_0044" pid="uva-lib:349351"/> disinterestedness
                        as to be incredible? My garb was meaner <lb/> than that of my companion, but
                        my intellectual <reg orig="accomplish-|ments">accomplishments</reg>
                        <lb/> were at least upon a level with his. Why should he <lb/> be supposed
                        to be insensible to my claims upon his kindness. <lb/> I was a youth
                        destitute of experience, money, and friends; <lb/> but I was not devoid of
                        all mental and personal endowments. <lb/> That my merit should be
                        discovered, even on such slender <lb/> intercourse, had surely nothing in it
                        that shocked belief.</p>
                    <p>While I was thus deliberating, my new friend was earnest <lb/> in his
                        solicitations for my company. He remarked my <reg orig="hes-|itation"
                            >hesitation</reg>, <lb/> but ascribed it to a wrong cause. "Come," said
                        <lb/> he, "I can guess your objections and can obviate them. <lb/> You are
                        afraid of being ushered into company; and people <lb/> who have passed their
                        lives like you have a wonderful <reg orig="an-|tipathy">antipathy</reg>
                        <lb/> to strange faces; but this is bed time with our family, <lb/> so that
                        we can defer your introduction to them till tomorrow. <lb/> We may go to our
                        chamber without being seen by any but <lb/> servants."</p>
                    <p>I had not been aware of this circumstance. My <reg orig="reluc-|tance"
                            >reluctance</reg>
                        <lb/> flowed from a different cause, but now that the <reg
                            orig="incon-|veniences">inconveniences</reg>
                        <lb/> of ceremony were mentioned, they appeared to <lb/> me of considerable
                        weight. I was well pleased that they <lb/> should thus be avoided, and
                        consented to go along with him.</p>
                    <p>We passed several streets and turned several corners. At <lb/> last we turned
                        into a kind of court which seemed to be <lb/> chiefly occupied by stables.
                        "We will go," said he, "by <lb/> the back way into the house. We shall thus
                        save ourselves <lb/> the necessity of entering the parlor, where some of the
                        <lb/> family may still be."</p>
                    <p>My companion was as talkative as ever, but said nothing <lb/> from which I
                        could gather any knowledge of the number, <lb/> character and condition of
                        his family.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="small-caps">We</hi> arrived at a brick wall through which we passed
                        by <lb/> a gate into an extensive court or yard. The darkness would <lb/>
                        allow me to see nothing but outlines. Compared with the <lb/>
                        <pb n="32" entity="eaf033v2_0045" pid="uva-lib:349352"/> pigmy dimensions of
                        my father's wooden hovel, the <reg orig="build-|ings">buildings</reg>
                        <lb/> before me were of gigantic loftiness. The horses <lb/> were here far
                        more magnificently accommodated than I had <lb/> been. By a large door we
                        entered an elevated hall. "Stay <lb/> here," said he, "just while I fetch a
                        light."</p>
                    <p>He returned bearing a candle, before I had time to ponder <lb/> on my present
                        situation.</p>
                    <p>We now ascended a staircase, covered with painted <reg orig="can-|vas"
                            >canvas</reg>. <lb/> No one whose inexperience is less than mine, can
                        <lb/> imagine to himself the impressions made upon me by <reg

                        <lb/> objects. The height to which this stair ascended, <lb/> its
                        dimensions, and its ornaments, appeared to me a <reg orig="combi-|nation"
                            >combination</reg>
                        <lb/> of all that was pompous and superb.</p>
                    <p>We stopped not till we had reached the third story. <lb/> Here my companion
                        unlocked and led the way into a <lb/> chamber. "This," said he, "is my room;
                        permit me to <lb/> welcome you into it."</p>
                    <p>I had no time to examine this room before, by some <reg orig="acci-|dent"
                            >accident</reg>, <lb/> the candle was extinguished. "Curse upon my <lb/>
                        carelessness," said he. "I must go down again and light <lb/> the candle. I
                        will return in a twinkling. Meanwhile you <lb/> may undress yourself and go
                        to bed." He went out, and, <lb/> as I afterwards recollected, locked the
                        door behind him.</p>
                    <p>I was not indisposed to follow his advice, but my curiosity <lb/> would first
                        be gratified by a survey of the room. Its height <lb/> and spaciousness were
                        imperfectly discernible by star-light, <lb/> and by gleams from a street
                        lamp. The floor was covered <lb/> with a carpet, the walls with brilliant
                        hangings; the bed <lb/> and windows were shrouded by curtains of a rich
                        texture <lb/> and glossy hues. Hitherto I had merely read of these <lb/>
                        things. I knew them to be the decorations of opulence, <lb/> and yet as I
                        viewed them, and remembered where and what <lb/> I was on the same hour the
                        preceding day, I could <reg orig="scarce-|ly">scarcely</reg>
                        <lb/> believe myself awake, or that my senses were not <reg

                        <lb/> by some spell.</p>
                    <p>"Where," said I, "will this adventure terminate. I rise <lb/> on the morrow
                        with the dawn and speed into the country. <lb/> When this night is
                        remembered, how like a vision will it <lb/> appear! If I tell the tale by a
                        kitchen fire, my veracity will <lb/> be disputed. I shall be ranked with the
                        story tellers of <lb/> Shiraz and Bagdad."</p>
                    <pb n="33" entity="eaf033v2_0046" pid="uva-lib:349353"/>
                    <p>Though busied in these reflections, I was not inattentive <lb/> to the
                        progress of time. Methought my companion was <lb/> remarkably dilatory. He
                        went merely to relight his candle, <lb/> but certainly he might, during this
                        time, have performed the <lb/> operation ten times over. Some unforeseen
                        accident might <lb/> occasion his delay.</p>
                    <p>Another interval passed and no tokens of his coming. I <lb/> began now to
                        grow uneasy. I was unable to account for his <lb/> detention. Was not some
                        treachery designed? I went to <lb/> the door, and found that it was locked.
                        This heightened <lb/> my suspicions. I was alone, a stranger, in an upper
                        room <lb/> of the house. Should my conductor have disappeared, by <lb/>
                        design or by accident, and some one of the family should <lb/> find me here,
                        what would be the consequence? Should I <lb/> not be arrested as a thief,
                        and conveyed to prison? My <lb/> transition from the street to this chamber
                        would not be more <lb/> rapid than my passage hence to a gaol.</p>
                    <p>These ideas struck me with panic. I revolved them <lb/> anew, but they only
                        acquired greater plausibility. No doubt <lb/> I had been the victim of
                        malicious artifice. Inclination, <lb/> however, conjured up opposite
                        sentiments and my fears <lb/> began to subside. What motive, I asked, could
                        induce a <lb/> human being to inflict wanton injury? I could not account
                        <lb/> for his delay, but how numberless were the contingencies <lb/> that
                        might occasion it?</p>
                    <p>I was somewhat comforted by these reflections, but the <lb/> consolation they
                        afforded was short-lived. I was listening <lb/> with the utmost eagerness to
                        catch the sound of a foot, when <lb/> a noise was indeed heard, but totally
                        unlike a step. It was <lb/> human breath struggling, as it were, for
                        passage. On the <lb/> first effort of attention, it appeared like a groan.
                        Whence <lb/> it arose I could not tell. He that uttered it was near; <lb/>
                        perhaps in the room.</p>
                    <p>Presently the same noise was again heard, and now I <reg orig="per-|ceived"
                            >perceived</reg>
                        <lb/> that it came from the bed. It was accompanied <lb/> with a motion like
                        some one changing his posture. What I <lb/> at first conceived to be a
                        groan, appeared now to be nothing <lb/> more than the expiration of a
                        sleeping man. What should <lb/> I infer from this incident? My companion did
                        not apprize <lb/> me that the apartment was inhabited. Was his imposture
                        <lb/> a jestful or a wicked one?</p>
                    <pb n="34" entity="eaf033v2_0047" pid="uva-lib:349354"/>
                    <p>There was no need to deliberate. There were no means <lb/> of concealment or
                        escape. The person would sometime <lb/> awaken and detect me. The interval
                        would only be fraught <lb/> with agony, and it was wise to shorten it.
                        Should I not <lb/> withdraw the curtain, awake the person, and encounter at
                        <lb/> once all the consequences of my situation? I glided softly <lb/> to
                        the bed, when the thought occurred, may not the sleeper <lb/> be a
                        female?</p>
                    <p>I cannot describe the mixture of dread and of shame <lb/> which glowed in my
                        veins. The light in which such a <lb/> visitant would be probably regarded
                        by a woman's fears, <lb/> the precipitate alarms that might be given, the
                        injury <lb/> which I might unknowingly inflict, or undeservedly suffer,
                        <lb/> threw my thoughts into painful confusion. My presence <lb/> might
                        pollute a spotless reputation, or furnish fuel to <lb/> jealousy.</p>
                    <p>Still, though it were a female, would not least injury be <lb/> done by
                        gently interrupting her slumber? But the question <lb/> of sex still
                        remained to be decided. For this end I once <lb/> more approached the bed,
                        and drew aside the silk. The <lb/> sleeper was a babe. This I discovered by
                        the glimmer of <lb/> a street lamp.</p>
                    <p>Part of my solicitudes were now removed. It was plain <lb/> that this chamber
                        belonged to a nurse or a mother. She <lb/> had not yet come to bed. Perhaps
                        it was a married pair, <lb/> and their approach might be momently expected.
                        I pictured <lb/> to myself their entrance and my own detection. I could
                        <lb/> imagine no consequence that was not disastrous and <reg
                            orig="hor-|rible">horrible</reg>, <lb/> and from which I would not, at
                        any price, escape. I <lb/> again examined the door, and found that exit by
                        this avenue <lb/> was impossible. There were other doors in this room. <lb/>
                        Any practicable expedient in this extremity was to be <reg orig="pur-|sued"
                            >pursued</reg>. <lb/> One of these was bolted. I unfastened it and found
                        <lb/> a considerable space within. Should I immure myself in <lb/> this
                        closet? I saw no benefit that would finally result from <lb/> it. I
                        discovered that there was a bolt on the inside, which <lb/> would somewhat
                        contribute to security. This being drawn, <lb/> no one could enter without
                        breaking the door.</p>
                    <p>I had scarcely paused, when the long expected sound of <lb/> footsteps was
                        heard in the entry. Was it my companion or <lb/> a stranger? If it were the
                        latter, I had not yet mustered <lb/>
                        <pb n="35" entity="eaf033v2_0048" pid="uva-lib:349355"/> courage sufficient
                        to meet him. I cannot applaud the <reg orig="mag-|nanimity"
                            >magnanimity</reg>
                        <lb/> of my proceeding, but no one can expect intrepid <lb/> or judicious
                        measures from one in my circumstances. I <lb/> stepped into the closet, and
                        closed the door. Some one <reg orig="im-|mediately">immediately</reg>
                        <lb/> after unlocked the chamber door. He was <reg orig="unat-|tended"
                            >unattended</reg>
                        <lb/> with a light. The footsteps, as they moved along <lb/> the carpet,
                        could scarcely be heard.</p>
                    <p>I waited impatiently for some token by which I might be <lb/> governed. I put
                        my ear to the key-hole, and at length <lb/> heard a voice, but not that of
                        my companion, exclaim, <lb/> somewhat above a whisper, "Smiling cherub! safe
                        and <lb/> sound, I see. Would to God my experiment may succeed, <lb/> and
                        that thou mayest find a mother where I have found a <lb/> wife!" There he
                        stopped. He appeared to kiss the babe, <lb/> and presently retiring, locked
                        the door after him.</p>
                    <p>These words were capable of no consistent meaning. <lb/> They served, at
                        least, to assure me that I had been <lb/> treacherously dealt with. This
                        chamber, it was manifest, <lb/> did not belong to my companion. I put up
                        prayers to my <lb/> Deity that he would deliver me from these toils. What a
                        <lb/> condition was mine! Immersed in palpable darkness! shut <lb/> up in
                        this unknown recess! lurking like a robber!</p>
                    <p>My meditations were disturbed by new sounds. The <lb/> door was unlocked,
                        more than one person entered the <reg orig="apart-|ment">apartment</reg>,
                        <lb/> and light streamed through the key-hole. I looked; <lb/> but the
                        aperture was too small and the figures passed too <lb/> quickly to permit me
                        the sight of them. I bent my ear, <lb/> and this imparted some more
                        authentic information.</p>
                    <p>The man, as I judged by the voice, was the same who <lb/> had just departed.
                        Rustling of silk denoted his companion <lb/> to be female. Some words being
                        uttered by the man, in <lb/> too low a key to be overheard, the lady burst
                        into a passion <lb/> of tears. He strove to comfort her by soothing tones
                        and <lb/> tender appellations. "How can it be helped," said he. <lb/> "It is
                        time to resume your courage. Your duty to <reg orig="your-|self"
                            >yourself</reg>
                        <lb/> and to me, requires you to subdue this unreasonable <lb/> grief."</p>
                    <p>He spoke frequently in this strain, but all he said seemed <lb/> to have
                        little influence in pacifying the lady. At length, <lb/> however, her sobs
                        began to lessen in vehemence and <reg orig="fre-|quency">frequency</reg>.
                        <lb/> He exhorted her to seek for some repose. <reg orig="Ap-|parently"
                            >Apparently</reg>
                        <lb/>
                        <pb n="36" entity="eaf033v2_0049" pid="uva-lib:349356"/> she prepared to
                        comply, and conversation was, for <lb/> a few minutes, intermitted.</p>
                    <p>I could not but advert to the possibility that some <reg orig="occa-|sion"
                            >occasion</reg>
                        <lb/> to examine the closet, in which I was immured, might <lb/> occur. I
                        knew not in what manner to demean myself if <lb/> this should take place. I
                        had no option at present. By <lb/> withdrawing myself from view I had lost
                        the privilege of an <lb/> upright deportment. Yet the thought of spending
                        the night <lb/> in this spot was not to be endured.</p>
                    <p>Gradually I began to view the project of bursting from the <lb/> closet, and
                        trusting to the energy of truth and of an artless <lb/> tale, with more
                        complacency. More than once my hand <lb/> was placed upon the bolt, but
                        withdrawn by a sudden <reg orig="falter-|ing">faltering</reg>
                        <lb/> of resolution. When one attempt failed, I recurred <lb/> once more to
                        such reflections as were adapted to renew my <lb/> purpose.</p>
                    <p>I preconcerted the address which I should use. I <reg orig="resol-|ved"
                            >resolved</reg>
                        <lb/> to be perfectly explicit. To withhold no particular of <lb/> my
                        adventures from the moment of my arrival. My <reg orig="de-|scription"
                            >description</reg>
                        <lb/> must necessarily suit some person within their <lb/> knowledge. All I
                        should want was liberty to depart; but if <lb/> this were not allowed, I
                        might at least hope to escape any <lb/> ill treatment, and to be confronted
                        with my betrayer. In <lb/> that case I did not fear to make him the attester
                        of my <reg orig="in-|nocence">innocence</reg>.</p>
                    <p>Influenced by these considerations, I once more touched <lb/> the lock. At
                        that moment the lady shrieked, and exclaimed, <lb/> "Good God! What is
                        here?" An interesting conversation <lb/> ensued. The object that excited her
                        astonishment was the <lb/> child. I collected from what passed that the
                        discovery was <lb/> wholly unexpected by her. Her husband acted as if <lb/>
                        equally unaware of this event. He joined in all her <reg
                            orig="excla-|mations">exclamations</reg>
                        <lb/> of wonder and all her wild conjectures. When <lb/> these were somewhat
                        exhausted he artfully insinuated the <lb/> propriety of bestowing care upon
                        the little foundling. I <lb/> now found that her grief had been occasioned
                        by the recent <lb/> loss of her own offspring. She was, for some time,
                        averse <lb/> to her husband's proposal, but at length was persuaded to <lb/>
                        take the babe to her bosom and give it nourishment.</p>
                    <p>This incident had diverted my mind from its favorite <reg orig="pro-|ject"
                            >project</reg>, <lb/> and filled me with speculations on the nature of
                        the <lb/>
                        <pb n="37" entity="eaf033v2_0050" pid="uva-lib:349357">
                            <fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">4</fw>
                        </pb> scene. One explication was obvious, that the husband was <lb/> the
                        parent of this child, and had used this singular expedient <lb/> to procure
                        for it the maternal protection of his wife. It <lb/> would soon claim from
                        her all the fondness which she <reg orig="en-|tertained">entertained</reg>
                        <lb/> for her own progeny. No suspicion probably had <lb/> yet, or would
                        hereafter, occur with regard to its true parent. <lb/> If her character be
                        distinguished by the usual attributes of <lb/> women, the knowledge of this
                        truth may convert her love <lb/> into hatred. I reflected with amazement on
                        the slightness <lb/> of that thread by which human passions are led from
                        their <lb/> true direction. With no less amazement did I remark the <lb/>
                        complexity of incidents by which I had been empowered to <lb/> communicate
                        to her this truth. How baseless are the <reg orig="struc-|tures"
                            >structures</reg>
                        <lb/> of falsehood, which we build in opposition to the system <lb/> of
                        eternal nature. If I should escape undetected from this <lb/> recess, it
                        will be true that I never saw the face of either of <lb/> these persons, and
                        yet I am acquainted with the most secret <lb/> transaction of their
                        lives.</p>
                    <p>My own situation was now more critical than before. The <lb/> lights were
                        extinguished, and the parties had sought repose. <lb/> To issue from the
                        closet now would be imminently dangerous. <lb/> My councils were again at a
                        stand and my designs <reg orig="frustra-|ted">frustrated</reg>. <lb/>
                        Meanwhile the persons did not drop their discourse, <lb/> and I thought
                        myself justified in listening. Many facts of <lb/> the most secret and
                        momentous nature were alluded to. <lb/> Some allusions were unintelligible.
                        To others I was able to <lb/> affix a plausible meaning, and some were
                        palpable enough. <lb/> Every word that was uttered on that occasion is
                        indelibly <lb/> imprinted on my memory. Perhaps the singularity of my <lb/>
                        circumstances and my previous ignorance of what was <reg orig="pass-|ing"
                            >passing</reg>
                        <lb/> in the world, contributed to render me a greedy listener. <lb/> Most
                        that was said I shall overlook, but one part of the <reg
                            orig="con-|versation">conversation</reg>
                        <lb/> it will be necessary to repeat.</p>
                    <p>A large company had assembled that evening at their <lb/> house. They
                        criticised the character and manners of <reg orig="seve-|ral">several</reg>.
                        <lb/> At last the husband said, "What think you of the <lb/> Naboh?
                        Especially when he talked about riches? How <lb/> artfully he encourages the
                        notion of his poverty! Yet not a <lb/> soul believes him. I cannot for my
                        part account for that <lb/>
                        <pb n="38" entity="eaf033v2_0051" pid="uva-lib:349358"/> scheme of his. I
                        half suspect that his wealth flows from a <lb/> bad source, since he is so
                        studious of concealing it."</p>
                    <p>"Perhaps, after all," said the lady, "you are mistaken as <lb/> to his
                        wealth."</p>
                    <p>"Impossible," exclaimed the other. "Mark how he lives. <lb/> Have I not seen
                        his bank account. His deposits, since he <lb/> has been here, amount to no
                        less than half a million."</p>
                    <p>"Heaven grant that it be so," said the lady with a sigh. <lb/> "I shall think
                        with less aversion of your scheme. If poor <lb/> Tom's fortune be made, and
                        he not the worse, or but little <lb/> the worse on that account, I shall
                        think it on the whole <lb/> best."</p>
                    <p>"That," replied he, "is what reconciles me to the <lb/> scheme. To him thirty
                        thousand are nothing."</p>
                    <p>"But will he not suspect you of some hand in it?"</p>
                    <p>"How can he? Will I not appear to lose as well as <reg orig="him-|self"
                            >himself</reg>? <lb/> Tom is my brother, but who can be supposed to
                        <lb/> answer for a brother's integrity; but he cannot suspect <lb/> either
                        of us. Nothing less than a miracle can bring our <lb/> plot to light.
                        Besides, this man is not what he ought to be. <lb/> He will, sometime or
                        other, come out to be a grand <reg orig="impos-|tor">impostor</reg>. <lb/>
                        He makes money by other arts than bargain and sale. <lb/> He has found his
                        way, by some means, to the Portuguese <lb/> treasury."</p>
                    <p>Here the conversation took a new direction, and after <lb/> some time, the
                        silence of sleep ensued.</p>
                    <p>Who, thought I, is this nabob who counts his dollars by <lb/> half millions,
                        and on whom, it seems as if some fraud was <lb/> intended to be practised.
                        Amidst their wariness and <reg orig="sub-|tlety">subtlety</reg>
                        <lb/> how little are they aware that their conversation has <lb/> been
                        overheard! By means as inscrutable as those which <lb/> conducted me hither,
                        I may hereafter be enabled to profit <lb/> by this detection of a plot. But,
                        meanwhile, what was I to <lb/> do? How was I to effect my escape from this
                        perilous <lb/> asylum?</p>
                    <p>After much reflection it occurred to me that to gain the <lb/> street without
                        exciting their notice was not utterly impossible. <lb/> Sleep does not
                        commonly end of itself, unless at a certain <lb/> period. What impediments
                        were there between me and <lb/> liberty which I could not remove, and remove
                        with so much <lb/> caution as to escape notice. Motion and sound inevitably
                        go <lb/>
                        <pb n="39" entity="eaf033v2_0052" pid="uva-lib:349359"/> together, but every
                        sound is not attended to. The doors of <lb/> the closet and the chamber did
                        not creak upon their hinges. <lb/> The latter might be locked. This I was
                        able to ascertain <lb/> only by experiment. If it were so, yet the key was

                        <lb/> in the lock and might be used without much noise.</p>
                    <p>I waited till their slow and hoarser inspirations shewed <lb/> them to be
                        both asleep. Just then, on changing my position, <lb/> my head struck
                        against some things which depended from <lb/> the ceiling of the closet.
                        They were impliments of some <lb/> kind which rattled against each other in
                        consequence of this <lb/> unlucky blow. I was fearful lest this noise should
                        alarm, as <lb/> the closet was little distant from the bed. The breathing of
                        <lb/> one instantly ceased, and a motion was made as if the head <lb/> were
                        lifted from the pillow. This motion, which was made <lb/> by the husband,
                        awaked his companion, who exclaimed, <lb/> "What is the matter?"</p>
                    <p>"Something, I believe," replied he, "in the closet. If I <lb/> was not
                        dreaming, I heard the pistols strike against each <lb/> other as if some one
                        was taking them down."</p>
                    <p>This intimation was well suited to alarm the lady. She <lb/> besought him to
                        ascertain the matter. This to my utter <reg orig="dis-|may">dismay</reg>
                        <lb/> he at first consented to do, but presently observed that <lb/>
                        probably his ears had misinformed him. It was hardly <reg orig="pos-|sible"
                            >possible</reg>
                        <lb/> that the sound proceeded from them. It might be a rat, <lb/> or his
                        own fancy might have fashioned it. It is not easy to <lb/> describe my
                        trepidations while this conference was holding. <lb/> I saw how easily their
                        slumber was disturhed. The obstacles <lb/> to my escape were less
                        surmountable than I had imagined.</p>
                    <p>In a little time all was again still. I waited till the usual <lb/> tokens of
                        sleep were distinguishable. I once more resumed <lb/> my attempt. The bolt
                        was withdrawn with all possible <reg orig="slow-|ness">slowness</reg>; <lb/>
                        but I could by no means prevent all sound. My state <lb/> was full of
                        inquietude and suspense; my attention being <lb/> painfully divided between
                        the bolt and the condition of the <lb/> sleepers. The difficulty lay in
                        giving that degree of force <lb/> which was barely sufficient. Perhaps not
                        less than fifteen <lb/> minutes were consumed in this operation. At last it
                        was <lb/> happily effected and the door was cautiously opened.</p>
                    <p>Emerging as I did from utter darkness, the light admitted <lb/> into three
                        windows, produced, to my eyes, a considerable <lb/> illumination. Objects
                        which, on my first entrance into this <lb/>
                        <pb n="40" entity="eaf033v2_0053" pid="uva-lib:349360"/> apartment, were
                        invisible, were now clearly discerned. The <lb/> bed was shrouded by
                        curtains, yet I shrunk back into my <lb/> covert, fearful of being seen. To
                        facilitate my escape I put <lb/> off my shoes. My mind was so full of
                        objects of more <reg orig="ur-|gent">urgent</reg>
                        <lb/> moment, that the propriety of taking them along with <lb/> me never
                        occurred. I left them in the closet.</p>
                    <p>I now glided across the apartment to the door. I was <lb/> not a little
                        discouraged by observing that the key was <reg orig="want-|ing"
                            >wanting</reg>. <lb/> My whole hope depended on the omission to lock it.
                        <lb/> In my haste to ascertain this point, I made some noise which <lb/>
                        again roused one of the sleepers. He started and cried <lb/> "Who is
                        there?"</p>
                    <p>I now regarded my case as desperate, and detection as <lb/> inevitable. My
                        apprehensions, rather than my caution, kept <lb/> me mute. I shrunk to the
                        wall, and waited in a kind of <lb/> agony for the moment that should decide
                        my fate.</p>
                    <p>The lady was again roused. In answer to her inquiries, <lb/> her husband said
                        that some one he believed was at the door, <lb/> but there was no danger of
                        their entering, for he had locked <lb/> it, and the key was in his
                        pocket.</p>
                    <p>My courage was completely annihilated by this piece of <lb/> intelligence. My
                        resources were now at an end. I could <lb/> only remain in this spot, till
                        the morning light, which could <lb/> be at no great distance, should
                        discover me. My <reg orig="inex-|perience">inexperience</reg>
                        <lb/> disabled me from estimating all the perils of my <lb/> situation.
                        Perhaps I had no more than temporary <reg orig="incon-|veniences"
                            >inconveniences</reg>
                        <lb/> to dread. My intention was innocent, and I had <lb/> been betrayed
                        into my present situation, not by my own <lb/> wickedness but the wickedness
                        of others.</p>
                    <p>I was deeply impressed with the ambiguousness which <lb/> would necessarily
                        rest upon my motives, and the scrutiny to <lb/> which they would be
                        subjected. I shuddered at the bare <lb/> possibility of being ranked with
                        thieves. These reflections <lb/> again gave edge to my ingenuity in search
                        of the means of <lb/> escape. I had carefully attended to the circumstances
                        of <lb/> their entrance. Possibly the act of locking had been <reg
                            orig="un-|noticed">unnoticed</reg>; <lb/> but, was it not likewise
                        possible that this person <lb/> had been mistaken? The key was gone. Would
                        this have <lb/> been the case if the door were unlocked?</p>
                    <p>My fears, rather than my hopes, impelled me to make the <lb/>
                        <pb n="41" entity="eaf033v2_0054" pid="uva-lib:349361">

                        </pb> experiment. I drew back the latch, and, to my unspeakable <lb/> joy,
                        the door opened.</p>
                    <p>I passed through and explored my way to the staircase. <lb/> I descended till
                        I reached the bottom. I could not recollect <lb/> with accuracy the position
                        of the door leading into the court, <lb/> but by carefully feeling along the
                        wall with my hands, I at <lb/> length discovered it. It was fastened by
                        several bolts and a <lb/> lock. The bolts were easily withdrawn, but the key
                        was <lb/> removed. I knew not where it was deposited. I thought I <lb/> had
                        reached the threshold of liberty, but here was an <reg orig="im-|pediment"
                            >impediment</reg>
                        <lb/> that threatened to be insurmountable.</p>
                    <p>But if doors could not be passed, windows might be <reg orig="un-|barred"
                            >unbarred</reg>. <lb/> I remembered that my companion had gone into
                        <lb/> a door on the left hand, in search of a light. I searched <lb/> for
                        this door. Fortunately it was fastened only by a bolt. <lb/> It admitted me
                        into a room which I carefully explored till I <lb/> reached a window. I will
                        not dwell on my efforts to unbar <lb/> this entrance. Suffice it to say
                        that, after much exertion <lb/> and frequent mistakes, I at length found my
                        way into the <lb/> yard, and thence passed into the court.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="small-caps">Now</hi> I was once more on public ground. By so many
                        <lb/> anxious efforts had I disengaged myself from the perilous <lb/>
                        precincts of private property. As many stratagems as are <lb/> usually made
                        to enter a house, had been employed by me <lb/> to get out of it. I was
                        urged to the use of them by my <lb/> fears; yet so far from carrying off
                        spoil, I had escaped with <lb/> the loss of an essential part of my
                        dress.</p>
                    <p>I had now leisure to reflect. I seated myself on the <lb/> ground and
                        reviewed the scenes through which I had just <lb/> passed. I began to think
                        that my industry had been <reg orig="mis-|employed">misemployed</reg>. <lb/>
                        Suppose I had met the person on his first <reg orig="en-|trance"
                            >entrance</reg>
                        <lb/> into his chamber? Was the truth so utterly wild as <lb/> not to have
                        found credit? Since the door was locked, and <lb/> there was no other
                        avenue; what other statement but the <lb/>
                        <pb n="42" entity="eaf033v2_0055" pid="uva-lib:349362"/> true one would
                        account for my being found there? This <lb/> deportment had been worthy of
                        an honest purpose. My <lb/> betrayer probably expected that this would be
                        the issue <lb/> of his jest. My rustic simplicity, he might think, would
                        <lb/> suggest no more ambiguous or elaborate expedient. He <lb/> might
                        likewise have predetermined to interfere if my safety <lb/> had been really
                        endangered.</p>
                    <p>On the morrow the two doors of the chamber and the <lb/> window below would
                        be found unclosed. They will <reg orig="sus-|pect">suspect</reg>
                        <lb/> a design to pillage, but their searches will terminate in <lb/>
                        nothing but in the discovery of a pair of clumsy and dusty <lb/> shoes in
                        the closet. Now that I was safe I could not help <lb/> smiling at the
                        picture which my fancy drew of their anxiety <lb/> and wonder. These
                        thoughts, however, gave place to <lb/> more momentous considerations.</p>
                    <p>I could not imagine to myself a more perfect example of <lb/> indigence than
                        I now exhibited. There was no being in <lb/> the city on whose kindness I
                        had any claim. Money I had <lb/> none, and what I then wore comprised my
                        whole stock of <lb/> moveables. I had just lost my shoes, and this loss
                        rendered <lb/> my stockings of no use. My dignity remonstrated against <lb/>
                        a barefoot pilgrimage, but to this, necessity now reconciled <lb/> me. I
                        threw my stockings between the bars of a stable <lb/> window, belonging, as
                        I thought, to the mansion I had just <lb/> left. These, together with my
                        shoes, I left to pay the cost <lb/> of my entertainment.</p>
                    <p>I saw that the city was no place for me. The end that I <lb/> had had in
                        view, of procuring some mechanical employment, <lb/> could only be obtained
                        by the use of means, but what <lb/> means to pursue I knew not. This night's
                        perils and <reg orig="de-|ceptions">deceptions</reg>
                        <lb/> gave me a distaste to a city life, and my ancient <lb/> occupations
                        rose to my view enhanced by a thousand <reg orig="imagi-|nary"
                            >imaginary</reg>
                        <lb/> charms. I resolved forthwith to strike into the country.</p>
                    <p>The day began now to dawn. It was Sunday, and I was <lb/> desirous of eluding
                        observation. I was somewhat recruited <lb/> by rest, though the languors of
                        sleeplessness oppressed me. <lb/> I meant to throw myself on the first lap
                        of verdure I should <lb/> meet, and indulge in sleep that I so much wanted.
                        I knew <lb/> not the direction of the streets; but followed that which I
                        <lb/> first entered from the court, trusting that, by adhering <lb/>
                        steadily to one course, I should sometime reach the fields. <lb/>
                        <pb n="43" entity="eaf033v2_0056" pid="uva-lib:349363"/> This street, as I
                        afterwards found, tended to Schuylkill, <lb/> and soon extricated me from
                        houses. I could not cross this <lb/> river without payment of toll. It was
                        requisite to cross it <lb/> in order to reach that part of the country
                        whither I was <lb/> desirous of going, but how should I effect my passage? I
                        <lb/> knew of no ford, and the smallest expense exceeded my <lb/> capacity.
                        Ten thousand guineas and a farthing were <lb/> equally remote from nothing,
                        and nothing was the portion <lb/> allotted to me.</p>
                    <p>While my mind was thus occupied, I turned up one of <lb/> the streets which
                        tend northward. It was, for some length, <lb/> uninhabited and unpaved.
                        Presently I reached a pavement, <lb/> and a painted fence, along which a row
                        of poplars was <lb/> planted. It bounded a garden into which a knothole <reg
                            orig="per-|mitted">permitted</reg>
                        <lb/> me to pry. The inclosure was a charming green, <lb/> which I saw
                        appended to a house of the loftiest and most <lb/> stately order. It seemed
                        like a recent erection, had all the <lb/> gloss of novelty, and exhibited,
                        to my unpractised eyes, <lb/> the magnificence of palaces. My father's
                        dwelling did not <lb/> equal the height of one story, and might be easily
                        comprised <lb/> in one fourth of those buildings which here were designed
                        <lb/> to accommodate the menials. My heart dictated the <reg
                            orig="com-|parison">comparison</reg>
                        <lb/> between my own condition and that of the <reg orig="proprie-|tors"
                            >proprietors</reg>
                        <lb/> of this domain. How wide and how impassable was <lb/> the gulf by
                        which we were separated! This fair <reg orig="inherit-|ance"
                            >inheritance</reg>
                        <lb/> had fallen to one who, perhaps, would only abuse it <lb/> to the
                        purposes of luxury, while I, with intentions worthy <lb/> of the friend of
                        mankind, was doomed to wield the flail and <lb/> the mattock.</p>
                    <p>I had been entirely unaccustomed to this strain of <reg orig="reflec-|tion"
                            >reflection</reg>. <lb/> My books had taught me the dignity and safety
                        of <lb/> the middle path, and my darling writer abounded with <reg

                        <lb/> on rural life. At a distance from luxury and <lb/> pomp I viewed them,
                        perhaps, in a just light. A nearer <lb/> scrutiny confirmed my early
                        prepossessions, but at the <reg orig="dis-|tance">distance</reg>
                        <lb/> at which I now stood, the lofty edifices, the splendid <lb/>
                        furniture, and the copious accommodations of the rich, <reg orig="ex-|cited"
                            >excited</reg>
                        <lb/> my admiration and my envy.</p>
                    <p>I relinquished my station and proceeded, in a heartless <lb/> mood, along the
                        fence. I now came to the mansion itself. <lb/> The principal door was
                        entered by a staircase of marble. I <lb/>
                        <pb n="44" entity="eaf033v2_0057" pid="uva-lib:349364"/> had never seen the
                        stone of Carrara, and wildly supposed <lb/> this to have been dug from
                        Italian quarries. The beauty of <lb/> the poplars, the coolness exhaled from
                        the dew-besprent <lb/> bricks, the commodiousness of the seat which these
                        steps <lb/> afforded, and the uncertainty into which I was plunged <reg
                            orig="re-|specting">respecting</reg>
                        <lb/> my future conduct, all combined to make me <lb/> pause. I sat down on
                        the lower step and began to <reg orig="medi-|tate">meditate</reg>.</p>
                    <p>By some transition it occurred to me that the supply of <lb/> my most urgent
                        wants might be found in some inhabitant of <lb/> this house. I needed at
                        present a few cents; and what <lb/> were a few cents to the tenant of a
                        mansion like this. I <lb/> had an invincible aversion to the calling of a
                        beggar, but I <lb/> regarded with still more antipathy the vocation of a
                        thief; <lb/> to this alternative, however, I was now reduced. I must <lb/>
                        either steal or beg; unless, indeed, assistance could be <reg
                            orig="pro-|cured">procured</reg>
                        <lb/> under the notion of a loan. Would a stranger refuse <lb/> to lend the
                        pittance that I wanted? Surely not, when the <lb/> urgency of my wants were
                        explained.</p>
                    <p>I recollected other obstacles. To summon the master of <lb/> the house from
                        his bed, perhaps, for the sake of such an <lb/> application, would be
                        preposterous. I should be in more <lb/> danger of provoking his anger than
                        exciting his benevolence. <lb/> This request might, surely, with more
                        propriety be <reg orig="pre-|ferred">preferred</reg>
                        <lb/> to a passenger. I should, probably, meet several <lb/> before I should
                        arrive at Schuylkill.</p>
                    <p>A servant just then appeared at the door, with bucket and <lb/> brush. This
                        obliged me, much sooner than I intended, to <lb/> decamp. With some
                        reluctance I rose and proceeded.&mdash; <lb/> This house occupied the corner
                        of the street, and I now <lb/> turned this corner towards the country. A
                        person, at some <lb/> distance before me, was approaching in an opposite
                            <reg orig="direc-|tion">direction</reg>.</p>
                    <p>"Why," said I, "may I not make my demand of the <lb/> first man I meet? This
                        person exhibits tokens of ability to <lb/> lend. There is nothing chilling
                        or austere in his demeanor."</p>
                    <p>The resolution to address this passenger was almost <lb/> formed; but the
                        nearer he advanced, my resolves grew <lb/> less firm. He noticed me not till
                        he came within a few <lb/> paces. He seemed busy in reflection, and had not
                        my <lb/> figure caught his eye; or had he merely bestowed a passing <lb/>
                        <pb n="45" entity="eaf033v2_0058" pid="uva-lib:349365"/> glance upon me, I
                        should not have been sufficiently <reg orig="coura-|geous">courageous</reg>
                        <lb/> to have detained him. The event however was <lb/> widely
                        different.</p>
                    <p>He ooked at me and started. For an instant, as it were, <lb/> and till he had
                        time to dart at me a second glance, he <lb/> checked his pace. This behavior
                        decided mine, and he <lb/> stopped on perceiving tokens of a desire to
                        address him. I <lb/> spoke, but my accents and air sufficiently denoted my
                            <reg orig="em-|barrassments">embarrassments</reg>.</p>
                    <p>"I am going to solicit a favor, which my situation makes <lb/> of the highest
                        importance to me, and which I hope it will be <lb/> easy for you, sir, to
                        grant. It is not an alms but a loan that <lb/> I seek; a loan that I will
                        repay the moment I am able to do <lb/> it. I am going to the country, but
                        have not wherewith to <lb/> pay my passage over Schuylkill, or to buy a
                        morsel of <lb/> bread. May I venture to request of you, sir, the loan of
                        <lb/> sixpence? As I told you, it is my intention to repay it."</p>
                    <p>I delivered this address, not without some faltering, but <lb/> with great
                        earnestness. I laid particular stress upon my <reg orig="in-|tention"
                            >intention</reg>
                        <lb/> to refund the money. He listened with a most <reg orig="in-|quisitive"
                            >inquisitive</reg>
                        <lb/> air. His eye perused me from head to foot.</p>
                    <p>After some pause, he said, in a very emphatic manner, <lb/> "Why into the
                        country? Have you family? Kindred? <lb/> Friends?"</p>
                    <p>"No," answered I, "I have neither. I go in search of <lb/> the means of
                        subsistence. I have passed my life upon a <lb/> farm, and propose to die in
                        the same condition."</p>
                    <p>"Whence have you come?"</p>
                    <p>"I came yesterday from the country, with a view to earn <lb/> my bread in
                        some way, but have changed my plan and <reg orig="pro-|pose">propose</reg>
                        <lb/> now to return."</p>
                    <p>"Why have you changed it? In what way are you <reg orig="ca-|pable"
                            >capable</reg>
                        <lb/> of earning your bread?"</p>
                    <p>"I hardly know," said I. "I can, as yet, manage no tool, <lb/> that can be
                        managed in the city, but the pen. My habits <lb/> have, in some small
                        degree, qualified me for a writer. I <lb/> would willingly accept employment
                        of that kind."</p>
                    <p>He fixed his eyes upon the earth, and was silent for some <lb/> minutes. At
                        length, recovering himself, he said, "Follow <lb/> me to my house. Perhaps
                        something may be done for you. <lb/> If not I will lend you sixpence."</p>
                    <pb n="46" entity="eaf033v2_0059" pid="uva-lib:349366"/>
                    <p>It may be supposed that I eagerly complied with the <reg orig="invi-|tation"
                            >invitation</reg>. <lb/> My companion said no more, his air bespeaking
                        <lb/> him to be absorbed by his own thoughts, till he reached his <lb/>
                        house, which proved to be that at the door of which I had <lb/> been seated.
                        We entered a parlor together.</p>
                    <p>Unless you can assume my ignorance and my simplicity, <lb/> you will be
                        unable to conceive the impressions that were <lb/> made by the size and
                        ornaments of this apartment. I shall <lb/> omit these impressions, which,
                        indeed, no description could <lb/> adequately convey, and dwell on incidents
                        of greater <reg orig="mo-|ment">moment</reg>. <lb/> He asked me to give him
                        a specimen of my <reg orig="pen-|manship">penmanship</reg>. <lb/> I told you
                        that I had bestowed very great <reg orig="at-|tention">attention</reg>
                        <lb/> upon this art. Implements were brought and I sat <lb/> down to the
                        task. By some inexplicable connexion a line <lb/> in Shakspeare, occurred to
                        me, and I wrote</p>
                    <q>
                        <p rend="center">"My poverty, but not my will consents."</p>
                    </q>
                    <p>The sentiment conveyed in this line powerfully affected him, <lb/> but in a
                        way which I could not then comprehend. I <reg orig="col-|lected"
                            >collected</reg>
                        <lb/> from subsequent events that the inference was not <lb/> unfavorable to
                        my understanding or my morals. He <reg orig="ques-|tioned">questioned</reg>
                        <lb/> me as to my history. I related my origin and my <lb/> inducements to
                        desert my father's house. With respect to <lb/> last night's adventures I
                        was silent. I saw no useful purpose <lb/> that could be answered by
                        disclosure, and I half suspected <lb/> that my companion would refuse credit
                        to my tale.</p>
                    <p>There were frequent intervals of abstraction and <reg orig="reflec-|tion"
                            >reflection</reg>
                        <lb/> between his questions. My examination lasted not <lb/> much less than
                        an hour. At length he said, "I want an <lb/> amanuensis or copyist. On what
                        terms will you live with <lb/> me?"</p>
                    <p>I answered that I knew not how to estimate the value of <lb/> my services. I
                        knew not whether these services were <lb/> agreeable or healthful. My life
                        had hitherto been active. <lb/> My constitution was predisposed to diseases
                        of the lungs and <lb/> the change might be hurtful. I was willing, however,
                        to try <lb/> and to content myself for a month or a year, with so much <lb/>
                        as would furnish me with food, clothing, and lodging.</p>
                    <p>"'Tis well," said he, "You remain with me as long and <lb/> no longer than
                        both of us please. You shall lodge and eat <lb/> in this house. I will
                        supply you with clothing, and your <lb/>
                        <pb n="47" entity="eaf033v2_0060" pid="uva-lib:349367"/> task will be to
                        write what I dictate. Your person, I see, <lb/> has not shared much of your
                        attention. It is in my power <lb/> to equip you instantly in the manner
                        which becomes a <reg orig="resi-|dent">resident</reg>
                        <lb/> in this house. Come with me."</p>
                    <p>He led the way into the court behind and thence into a <lb/> neat building,
                        which contained large wooden vessels and a <lb/> pump; "There," said he,
                        "you may wash yourself, and <lb/> when that is done, I will conduct you to
                        your chamber and <lb/> your wardrobe."</p>
                    <p>This was speedily performed, and he accordingly led the <lb/> way to the
                        chamber. It was an apartment in the third story, <lb/> finished and
                        furnished in the same costly and superb style <lb/> with the rest of the
                        house. He opened closets and <reg orig="draw-|ers">drawers</reg>
                        <lb/> which overflowed with clothes and linen of all and of <lb/> the best
                        kinds. "These are yours," said he, "as long as <lb/> you stay with me. Dress
                        yourself as likes you best. Here <lb/> is every thing your nakedness
                        requires. When dressed <lb/> you may descend to breakfast." With these words
                        he <lb/> left me.</p>
                    <p>The clothes were all in the French style, as I afterwards, <lb/> by comparing
                        my garb with that of others, discovered. <lb/> They were fitted to my shape
                        with the nicest precision. I <lb/> bedecked myself with all my care. I
                        remembered the <lb/> style of dress used by my beloved Clavering. My locks
                        <lb/> were of shining auburn, flowing and smooth like his. <reg
                            orig="Hav-|ing">Having</reg>
                        <lb/> wrung the wet from them, and combed, I tied them <lb/> carelessly in a
                        black riband. Thus equipped I surveyed <lb/> myself in a mirror.</p>
                    <p>You may imagine, if you can, the sensations which this <lb/> instantaneous
                        transformation produced. Appearances are <lb/> wonderfully influenced by
                        dress. Check shirt, buttoned at <lb/> the neck, an awkward fustian coat,
                        check trowsers and bare <lb/> feet were now supplanted by linen and muslin,
                        nankeen coat <lb/> striped with green, a white silk waistcoat elegantly <reg
                            orig="needle-|wrought">needlewrought</reg>, <lb/> cassimer pantaloons,
                        stockings of variegated silk, <lb/> and shoes that in their softness,
                        pliancy, and polished surface <lb/> vied with sattin. I could scarcely
                        forbear looking back to <lb/> see whether the image in the glass, so well
                        proportioned, so <lb/> gallant, and so graceful, did not belong to another.
                        I could <lb/> scarcely recognise any lineaments of my own. I walked to <lb/>
                        the window. "Twenty minutes ago," said I, "I was <reg orig="tra-|versing"
                            >traversing</reg>
                        <lb/>
                        <pb n="48" entity="eaf033v2_0061" pid="uva-lib:349368"/> that path a
                        barefoot beggar; now I am thus." <lb/> Again I surveyed myself. "Surely some
                        insanity has <reg orig="fast-|ened">fastened</reg>
                        <lb/> on my understanding. My senses are the sport of <lb/> dramas. Some
                        magic that disdains the cumbrousness of <lb/> nature's progress, has wrought
                        this change." I was roused <lb/> from these doubts by a summons to
                        breakfast, obsequiously <lb/> delivered by a black servant.</p>
                    <p>I found Welbeck, (for I shall henceforth call him by his <lb/> true name,) at
                        the breakfast table. A superb equipage of <lb/> silver and china was before
                        him. He was startled at my <lb/> entrance. The change in my dress seemed for
                        a moment <lb/> to have deceived him. His eye was frequently fixed upon <lb/>
                        me with unusual steadfastness. At these times there was <lb/> inquietude and
                        wonder in his features.</p>
                    <p>I had now an opportunity of examining my host. There <lb/> was nicety but no
                        ornament in his dress. His form was of <lb/> the middle height, spare, but
                        vigorous and graceful. His <lb/> face was cast, I thought, in a foreign
                        mould. His forehead <lb/> receded beyond the usual degree in visages which I
                        had <lb/> seen. His eyes large and prominent, but imparting no marks <lb/>
                        of benignity and habitual joy. The rest of his face forcibly <lb/> suggested
                        the idea of a convex edge. His whole figure <lb/> impressed me with emotions
                        of veneration and awe. A <lb/> gravity that almost amounted to sadness
                        invariably attended <lb/> him when we were alone together.</p>
                    <p>He whispered the servant that waited, who immediately <lb/> retired. He then
                        said, turning to me, "A lady will enter <lb/> presently, whom you are to
                        treat with the respect due to my <lb/> daughter. You must not notice any
                        emotion she may <reg orig="be-|tray">betray</reg>
                        <lb/> at the sight of you, nor expect her to converse with <lb/> you; for
                        she does not understand your language." He had <lb/> scarcely spoken when
                        she entered. I was seized with <lb/> certain misgivings and flutterings
                        which a clownish education <lb/> may account for. I so far conquered my
                        timidity, however, <lb/> as to snatch a look at her. I was not born to
                        execute her <lb/> portrait. Perhaps the turban that wreathed her head, the
                        <lb/> brilliant texture and inimitable folds of her drapery, and <lb/>
                        nymphlike port, more than the essential attributes of her <lb/> person, gave
                        splendor to the celestial vision. Perhaps it <lb/> was her snowy hues and
                        the cast, rather than the position <lb/>

                        perhaps the wonder originated only in my own ignorance.</p>
                    <p>She did not immediately notice me. When she did she <lb/> almost shrieked
                        with surprise. She held up her hands, and <lb/> gazing upon me, uttered
                        various exclamations which I could <lb/> not understand. I could only remark
                        that her accents were <lb/> thrillingly musical. Her perturbations refused
                        to be stilled. <lb/> It was with difficulty that she withdrew her regards
                        from me. <lb/> Much conversation passed between her and Welbeck, but I <lb/>
                        could comprehend no part of it. I was at liberty to <reg orig="animad-|vert"
                            >animadvert</reg>
                        <lb/> on the visible part of their intercourse. I diverted some <lb/> part
                        of my attention from my own embarrassments, and fixed <lb/> it on their
                        looks.</p>
                    <p>In this art, as in most others, I was an unpractised <reg orig="simple-|ton"
                            >simpleton</reg>. <lb/> In the countenance of Welbeck, there was
                        somewhat <lb/> else than sympathy with the astonishment and distress of the
                        <lb/> lady; but I could not interpret these additional tokens. <lb/> When
                        her attention was engrossed by Welbeck, her eyes <lb/> were frequently
                        vagrant or downcast; her cheeks <reg orig="contract-|ed">contracted</reg>
                        <lb/> a deeper hue; and her breathing was almost prolonged <lb/> into a
                        sigh. These were marks on which I made no <reg orig="com-|ments"
                            >comments</reg>
                        <lb/> at the time. My own situation was calculated to <lb/> breed confusion
                        in my thoughts and awkwardness in my <lb/> gestures. Breakfast being
                        finished, the lady, apparently at <lb/> the request of Welbeck, sat down to
                        a piano forte.</p>
                    <p>Here again I must be silent. I was not wholly destitute <lb/> of musical
                        practice and musical taste. I had that degree of <lb/> knowledge which
                        enabled me to estimate the transcendent <lb/> skill of this performer. As if
                        the pathos of her touch were <lb/> insufficient, I found after some time
                        that the lawless jarrings <lb/> of the keys were chastened by her own more
                        liquid notes. <lb/> She played without a book, and though her base might be
                        <lb/> preconcerted, it was plain that her right-hand notes were <lb/>
                        momentary and spontaneous inspirations. Meanwhile <reg orig="Wel-|beck"
                            >Welbeck</reg>
                        <lb/> stood, leaning his arms on the back of a chair near her, <lb/> with
                        his eyes fixed on her face. His features were fraught <lb/> with a meaning
                        which I was eager to interpret, but unable.</p>
                    <p>I have read of transitions effected by magic; I have read <lb/> of palaces
                        and deserts which were subject to the dominion of <lb/> spells; poets may
                        sport with their power, but I am certain <lb/>
                        <pb n="50" entity="eaf033v2_0063" pid="uva-lib:349370"/> that no transition
                        was ever conceived more marvellous and <lb/> more beyond the reach of
                        foresight, than that which I had <lb/> just experienced. Heaths vexed by a
                        midnight storm may <lb/> be changed into a hall of choral nymphs and regal
                            <reg orig="banquet-|ing">banqueting</reg>; <lb/> forest glades may give

                        contemptible when <lb/> compared with that which placed me under this roof
                        and <lb/> gave me to partake in this audience. I know that my <reg

                        expected <lb/> that some comments would be made on her behavior, and <lb/>
                        that the cause of her surprise and distress on seeing me, <lb/> would be
                        explained, but Welbeck said nothing on that <reg orig="sub-|ject"
                            >subject</reg>. <lb/> When she had gone, he went to the window and stood
                        <lb/> for some time occupied, as it seemed, with his own thoughts. <lb/>
                        Then he turned to me, and, calling me by my name, desired <lb/> me to
                        accompany him up stairs. There was neither <reg orig="cheer-|fulness"

                        <lb/> nor mildness in his address, but neither was there <lb/> any thing
                        domineering or arrogant.</p>
                    <p>We entered an apartment on the same floor with my <lb/> chamber, but
                        separated from it by a spacious entry. It was <lb/> supplied with bureaus,
                        cabinets, and book-cases. "This," <lb/> said he, "is your room and mine; but
                        we must enter it and <lb/> leave it together. I mean to act not as your

                    <p>I obeyed this mandate with some awkwardness and <reg orig="hesita-|tion"
                            >hesitation</reg>. <lb/> I went into my own chamber not displeased with
                        an <lb/> opportunity of loneliness. I threw myself on a chair and <lb/>
                        resigned myself to those thoughts which would naturally <lb/> arise in this
                        situation. I speculated on the character and <lb/> views of Welbeck. I saw
                        that he was embosomed in <reg orig="tran-|quillity">tranquillity</reg>
                        <lb/> and grandeur. Riches, therefore, were his; but in <lb/> what did his
                        opulence consist, and whence did it arise? <lb/> What were the limits by
                        which it was confined, and what its <lb/> degree of permanence? I was
                        unhabituated to ideas of <lb/> floating or transferable wealth. The rent of
                        houses and <lb/> lands was the only species of property which was, as yet,
                        <lb/> perfectly intelligible. My previous ideas led me to regard <lb/>
                        Welbeck as the proprietor of this dwelling and of numerous <lb/> houses and
                        farms. By the same cause I was fain to <reg orig="sup-|pose">suppose</reg>
                        <lb/> him enriched by inheritance, and that his life had been <lb/>
                        uniform.</p>
                    <p>I next adverted to his social condition. This mansion <lb/> appeared to have
                        but two inhabitants besides servants. Who <lb/> was the nymph who had
                        hovered for a moment in my sight? <lb/> Had he not called her his daughter?
                        The apparent <reg orig="differ-|ence">difference</reg>
                        <lb/> in their ages would justify this relation; but her guise, <lb/> her
                        features, and her accents were foreign. Her language <lb/> I suspected
                        strongly to be that of Italy. How should he be <lb/> the father of an
                        Italian? But were there not some foreign <lb/> lineaments in his
                        countenance?</p>
                    <p>This idea seemed to open a new world to my view. I <lb/> had gained from my
                        books, confused ideas of European <lb/> governments and manners. I knew that
                        the present was a <lb/> period of revolution and hostility. Might not these
                        be <reg orig="illus-|trious">illustrious</reg>
                        <lb/> fugitives from Provence or the Milanese? Their <lb/> portable wealth,
                        which may reasonably be supposed to be <lb/> great, they have transported
                        hither. Thus may be <reg orig="explain-|ed">explained</reg>
                        <lb/>
                        <pb n="52" entity="eaf033v2_0065" pid="uva-lib:349372"/> the sorrow that
                        veils their countenance. The loss of <lb/> estates and honors; the untimely

                        <lb/> of his wife, may furnish eternal food for regrets. <reg

                        <lb/> utterance, though rapid and distinct, partook, as I <lb/> conceived,
                        in some very slight degree of a foreign idiom.</p>
                    <p>Such was the dream that haunted my undisciplined and <lb/> unenlightened
                        imagination. The more I revolved it, the <lb/> more plausible it seemed. On
                        this supposition every <reg orig="ap-|pearance">appearance</reg>
                        <lb/> that I had witnessed was easily solved&mdash;unless <unclear id="u1"/>
                        <lb/> were their treatment of me. This, at first, was a source of <lb/>
                        hopeless perplexity. Gradually, however, a clue seemed to <lb/> be afforded.
                        Welbeck had betrayed astonishment on my <lb/> first appearance. The lady's
                        wonder was mingled with <lb/> distress. Perhaps they discovered a remarkable
                            <reg orig="resem-|blance">resemblance</reg>
                        <lb/> between me and one who stood in the relation of <lb/> son to Welbeck,
                        and of brother to the lady. This <unclear id="u2">yo</unclear>
                        <lb/> might have perished on the scaffold or in war. These, no <lb/> doubt,
                        were his clothes. This chamber might have been <lb/> reserved for him, but
                        his death left it to be appropriated to <lb/> another.</p>
                    <p>I had hitherto been unable to guess at the reason why all <lb/> this kindness
                        had been lavished on me. Will not this <reg orig="con-|jecture"
                            >conjecture</reg>
                        <lb/> sufficiently account for it? No wonder that this <lb/> resemblance was
                        enhanced by assuming his dress.</p>
                    <p>Taking all circumstances into view, these ideas were not, <lb/> perhaps,
                        destitute of probability. Appearances naturally <lb/> suggested them to me.
                        They were, also, powerfully <reg orig="en-|forced">enforced</reg>
                        <lb/> by inclination. They threw me into transports of <lb/> wonder and
                        hope. When I dwelt upon the incidents of my <lb/> past life, and traced the
                        chain of events, from the death of <lb/> my mother to the present moment, I
                        almost acquiesced in <lb/> the notion that some beneficent and ruling genius
                        had <reg orig="pre-|pared">prepared</reg>
                        <lb/> my path for me. Events which, when foreseen, <lb/> would most ardently

                        inferred the <lb/> infatuation of despair, and the folly of precipitate <reg

                        <lb/> from temptation, and was therefore undepraved, but <lb/> this view of
                        things had a wonderful tendency to invigorate <lb/> my virtuous resolutions.
                        All within me was exhilaration <lb/> and joy.</p>
                    <p>There was but one thing wanting to exalt me to a dizzy <lb/> height, and give
                        me place among the stars of heaven. My <lb/> resemblance to her brother had
                        forcibly affected this lady; <lb/> but I was not her brother. I was raised
                        to a level with her <lb/> and made a tenant of the same mansion. Some
                        intercourse <lb/> would take place between us. Time would lay level <reg
                            orig="im-|pediments">impediments</reg>
                        <lb/> and establish familiarity, and this intercourse <lb/> might foster
                        love and terminate in&mdash;<hi rend="italic">marriage!</hi></p>
                    <p>These images were of a nature too glowing and <reg orig="expan-|sive"
                            >expansive</reg>
                        <lb/> to allow me to be longer inactive. I sallied forth into <lb/> the open
                        air. This tumult of delicious thoughts in some <lb/> time subsided, and gave
                        way to images relative to my <reg orig="pre-|sent">present</reg>
                        <lb/> situation. My curiosity was awake. As yet I had <lb/> seen little of
                        the city, and this opportunity for observation <lb/> was not to be
                        neglected. I therefore coursed through <reg orig="seve-|ral">several</reg>
                        <lb/> streets, attentively examining the objects that successively <lb/>
                        presented themselves.</p>
                    <p>At length, it occurred to me to search out the house in <lb/> which I had
                        lately been immured. I was not without hopes <lb/> that at some future
                        period I should be able to comprehend <lb/>
                        <pb n="54" entity="eaf033v2_0067" pid="uva-lib:349374"/> the allusions, and
                        brighten the obscurities that hung about <lb/> the dialogue of last
                        night.</p>
                    <p>The house was easily discovered. I reconnoitred the <lb/> court and gate
                        through which I had passed. The mansion <lb/> was of the first order in
                        magnitude and decoration. This <lb/> was not the bound of my present
                        discovery, for I was gifted <lb/> with that confidence which would make me
                        set on foot <reg orig="in-|quiries">inquiries</reg>
                        <lb/> in the neighborhood. I looked around for a suitable <lb/> medium of
                        intelligence. The opposite and adjoining houses <lb/> were small, and
                        apparently occupied by persons of an <reg orig="indi-|gent">indigent</reg>
                        <lb/> class. At one of these was a sign denoting it to be <lb/> the
                        residence of a tailor. Seated on a bench at the door <lb/> was a young man,
                        with coarse uncombed locks, breeches <lb/> knee-unbuttoned, stockings
                        ungartered, shoes slip-shod and <lb/> unbuckled, and a face unwashed, gazing
                        stupidly from <reg orig="hol-|low">hollow</reg>
                        <lb/> eyes. His aspect was embellished with good nature <lb/> though
                        indicative of ignorance.</p>
                    <p>This was the only person in sight. He might be able to <lb/> say something
                        concerning his opulent neighbor. To him, <lb/> therefore, I resolved to
                        apply. I went up to him, and, <lb/> pointing to the house in question, asked
                        him who lived <lb/> there?</p>
                    <p>He answered, "Mr. Mathews."</p>
                    <p>"What is his profession,&mdash;his way of life?"</p>
                    <p>"A gentleman. He does nothing but walk about."</p>
                    <p>"How long has he been married?"</p>
                    <p>"Married! He is not married as I know on. He never <lb/> has been married. He
                        is a bachelor."</p>
                    <p>This intelligence was unexpected. It made me pause to <lb/> reflect whether I
                        had not mistaken the house. This, <reg orig="how-|ever">however</reg>, <lb/>
                        seemed impossible. I renewed my questions.</p>
                    <p>"A bachelor, say you? Are you not mistaken?"</p>
                    <p>"No. It would be an odd thing if he was married. An <lb/> old fellow, with
                        one foot in the grave&mdash;Comical enough <lb/> for him to <hi
                            rend="italic">git</hi> a <hi rend="italic">vife.</hi>"</p>
                    <p>"An old man? Does he live alone? What is his <lb/> family?"</p>
                    <p>"No, he does not live alone. He has a neice that lives <lb/> with him. She is
                        married, and her husband lives there too."</p>
                    <p>"What is his name?"</p>
                    <p>"I don't know. I never heard it as I know on."</p>
                    <pb n="55" entity="eaf033v2_0068" pid="uva-lib:349375"/>
                    <p>"What is his trade?"</p>
                    <p>"He's a marchant; he keeps a store somewhere or <lb/> other; but I don't know
                        where."</p>
                    <p>"How long has he been married?"</p>
                    <p>"About two years. They lost a child lately. The young <lb/> woman was in a
                        huge taking about it. They say she was <lb/> quite crazy some days for the
                        death of the child; and she <lb/> is not quite out of <hi rend="italic">the
                            dumps</hi> yet. To be sure the child <lb/> was a sweet little thing; but
                        they need not make such a <lb/> rout about it. I'll warn they'll have enough
                        of them before <lb/> they die."</p>
                    <p>"What is the character of the young man? Where was <lb/> he born and
                        educated? Has he parents or brothers?"</p>
                    <p>My companion was incapable of answering these <reg orig="ques-|tions"
                            >questions</reg>, <lb/> and I left him with little essential addition to
                        the <lb/> knowledge I already possessed.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="small-caps">After</hi> viewing various parts of the city; intruding
                        into <lb/> churches; and diving into alleys, I returned. The rest of <lb/>
                        the day I spent chiefly in my chamber, reflecting on my <lb/> new condition;
                        surveying my apartment, its presses and <lb/> closets; and conjecturing the
                        causes of appearances.</p>
                    <p>At dinner and supper I was alone. Venturing to inquire <lb/> of the servant
                        where his master and mistress were, I was <lb/> answered that they were
                        engaged. I did not question him <lb/> as to the nature of their engagement,
                        though it was a fertile <lb/> source of curiosity.</p>
                    <p>Next morning, at breakfast, I again met Welbeck and the <lb/> lady. The
                        incidents were nearly those of the preceding <lb/> morning, if it were not
                        that the lady exhibited tokens of <lb/> somewhat greater uneasiness. When
                        she left us Welbeck <lb/> sank into apparent meditation. I was at a loss
                        whether to <lb/> retire or remain where I was. At last, however, I was on
                        <lb/> the point of leaving the room, when he broke silence and <lb/> began a
                        conversation with me.</p>
                    <pb n="56" entity="eaf033v2_0069" pid="uva-lib:349376"/>
                    <p>He put questions to me, the obvious scope of which was <lb/> to know my
                        sentiments on moral topics. I had no motives <lb/> to conceal my opinions,
                        and therefore delivered them with <lb/> frankness. At length he introduced
                        allusions to my own <lb/> history, and made more particular inquiries on
                        that head. <lb/> Here I was not equally frank; yet I did not feign any
                        thing, <lb/> but merely dealt in generals. I had acquired notions of <lb/>
                        propriety on this head, perhaps somewhat fastidious. <lb/> Minute details,
                        respecting our own concerns, are apt to <lb/> weary all but the narrator
                        himself. I said thus much and <lb/> the truth of my remark was eagerly
                        assented to.</p>
                    <p>With some marks of hesitation and after various <reg orig="prelimi-|naries"
                            >preliminaries</reg>, <lb/> my companion hinted that my own interest, as
                        well <lb/> as his, enjoined upon me silence to all but himself, on the <lb/>
                        subject of my birth and early adventures. It was not likely, <lb/> that
                        while in his service, my circle of acquaintance would be <lb/> large or my
                        intercourse with the world frequent; but in my <lb/> communication with
                        others he requested me to speak rather <lb/> of others than of myself. This
                        request, he said, might <reg orig="ap-|pear">appear</reg>
                        <lb/> singular to me, but he had his reasons for making it, <lb/> which it
                        was not necessary, at present, to disclose, though, <lb/> when I should know
                        them, I should readily acknowledge <lb/> their validity.</p>
                    <p>I scarcely knew what answer to make. I was willing to <lb/> oblige him. I was
                        far from expecting that any exigence <lb/> would occur, making disclosure my
                        duty. The <reg orig="employ-|ment">employment</reg>
                        <lb/> was productive of pain more than of pleasure, and the <lb/> curiosity
                        that would uselessly seek a knowledge of my past <lb/> life, was no less
                        impertinent than the loquacity that would <lb/> uselessly communicate that
                        knowledge. I readily promised, <lb/> therefore, to adhere to his advice.</p>
                    <p>This assurance afforded him evident satisfaction; yet it <lb/> did not seem
                        to amount to quite as much as he wished. He <lb/> repeated in stronger
                        terms, the necessity there was for <reg orig="cau-|tion">caution</reg>.
                        <lb/> He was far from suspecting me to possess an <reg orig="imperti-|nent"
                            >impertinent</reg>
                        <lb/> and talkative disposition, or that in my eagerness to <lb/> expatiate
                        on my own concerns, I should overstep the limits <lb/> of politeness. But
                        this was not enough. I was to govern <lb/> myself by a persuasion that the
                        interests of my friend and <lb/> myself would be materially affected by my
                        conduct.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps I ought to have allowed these insinuations to <lb/>
                        <pb n="57" entity="eaf033v2_0070" pid="uva-lib:349377"/> breed suspicion in
                        my mind; but conscious as I was of the <lb/> benefits which I had received
                        from this man; prone, from <lb/> my inexperience, to rely upon professions
                        and confide in <lb/> appearances; and unaware that I could be placed in any
                        <lb/> condition, in which mere silence respecting myself could be <lb/>
                        injurious or criminal, I made no scruple to promise <reg orig="compli-|ance"
                            >compliance</reg>
                        <lb/> with his wishes. Nay, I went farther than this; I <reg
                            orig="de-|sired">desired</reg>
                        <lb/> to be accurately informed as to what it was proper to <lb/> conceal.
                        He answered that my silence might extend to <reg orig="ev-|ery">every</reg>
                        <lb/> thing anterior to my arrival in the city, and my being <reg
                            orig="in-|corporated">incorporated</reg>
                        <lb/> with his family. Here our conversation ended, <lb/> and I retired to
                        ruminate on what had passed.</p>
                    <p>I derived little satisfaction from my reflections. I began <lb/> now to
                        perceive inconveniences that might arise from this <lb/> precipitate
                        promise. Whatever should happen in <reg orig="conse-|quence"
                            >consequence</reg>
                        <lb/> of my being immured in the chamber, and of the <lb/> loss of my
                        clothes and of the portrait of my friend, I had <lb/> bound myself to
                        silence. These inquietudes however, were <lb/> transient. I trusted that
                        these events would operate <reg orig="auspi-|ciously">auspiciously</reg>;
                        <lb/> but my curiosity was now awakened as to the <lb/> motives which <hi
                            rend="italic">Welbeck</hi> could have for exacting from me <lb/> this
                        concealment? To act under the guidance of another, <lb/> and to wander in
                        the dark, ignorant whither my path tended, <lb/> and what effects might flow
                        from my agency, was a new <lb/> and irksome situation.</p>
                    <p>From these thoughts I was recalled by a message from <lb/> Welbeck. He gave
                        me a folded paper which he requested <lb/> me to carry to No. &mdash;, South
                        Fourth Street, "Inquire," <lb/> said he, "for Mrs. Wentworth, in order
                        merely to ascertain <lb/> the house, for you need not ask to see her; merely
                        give the <lb/> letter to the servant and retire. Excuse me for imposing
                        <lb/> this service upon you. It is of too great moment to be <lb/> trusted
                        to a common messenger; I usually perform it <reg orig="my-|self"
                            >myself</reg>, <lb/> but am at present otherwise engaged."</p>
                    <p>I took the letter and set out to deliver it. This was a <lb/> trifling
                        circumstance, yet my mind was full of reflections on <lb/> the consequences
                        that might flow from it. I remembered <lb/> the directions that were given,
                        but construed them in a <reg orig="man-|ner">manner</reg>
                        <lb/> different, perhaps, from Welbeck's expectations or <lb/> wishes. He
                        had charged me to leave the billet with the <lb/> servant who happened to
                        answer my summons; but had he <lb/>
                        <pb n="58" entity="eaf033v2_0071" pid="uva-lib:349378"/> not said that the
                        message was important, in so much that it <lb/> could not be entrusted to
                        common hands? He had permitted, <lb/> rather than enjoined, me to dispense
                        with seeing the lady, <lb/> and this permission I conceived to be dictated
                        merely by <reg orig="re-|gard">regard</reg>
                        <lb/> to my convenience. It was incumbent on me, <reg orig="there-|fore"
                            >therefore</reg>, <lb/> to take some pains to deliver the script into
                        her own <lb/> hands.</p>
                    <p>I arrived at the house and knocked. A female servant <lb/> appeared. "Her
                        mistress was up stairs; she would tell her <lb/> if I wished to see her,"
                        and meanwhile invited me to enter <lb/> the parlor; I did so; and the girl
                        retired to inform her <reg orig="mis-|tress">mistress</reg>
                        <lb/> that one waited for her.&mdash;I ought to mention that my <lb/>
                        departure from the directions which I had received was, in <lb/> some
                        degree, owing to an inquisitive temper; I was eager <lb/> after knowledge,
                        and was disposed to profit by every <reg orig="oppor-|tunity"
                            >opportunity</reg>
                        <lb/> to survey the interior of dwellings and converse with <lb/> their
                        inhabitants.</p>
                    <p>I scanned the walls, the furniture, the pictures. Over <lb/> the fireplace
                        was a portrait in oil of a female. She was <lb/> elderly and matron-like.
                        Perhaps she was the mistress of <lb/> this habitation, and the person to
                        whom I should immediately <lb/> be introduced. Was it a casual suggestion,
                        or was there an <lb/> actual resemblance between the strokes of the pencil
                        which <lb/> executed this portrait and that of Clavering? However that <lb/>
                        be, the sight of this picture revived the memory of my <lb/> friend and
                        called up a fugitive suspicion that this was the <lb/> production of his
                        skill.</p>
                    <p>I was busily revolving this idea when the lady herself <reg orig="en-|tered"
                            >entered</reg>. <lb/> It was the same whose portrait I had been
                        examining. <lb/> She fixed scrutinizing and powerful eyes upon me. She <lb/>
                        looked at the superscription of the letter which I presented, <lb/> and
                        immediately resumed her examination of me. I was <lb/> somewhat abashed by
                        the closeness of her observation, and <lb/> gave tokens of this state of
                        mind which did not pass <reg orig="unob-|served">unobserved</reg>. <lb/>
                        They seemed instantly to remind her that she <lb/> behaved with too little
                        regard to civility. She recovered <lb/> herself and began to peruse the
                        letter. Having done this, <lb/> her attention was once more fixed upon me.
                        She was <lb/> evidently desirous of entering into some conversation, but
                        <lb/> seemed at a loss in what manner to begin. This situation <lb/> was new
                        to me and was productive of no small <reg orig="embarrass-|ment"
                            >embarrassment</reg>. <lb/>
                        <pb n="59" entity="eaf033v2_0072" pid="uva-lib:349379"/> I was preparing to
                        take my leave when she spoke, <lb/> though not without considerable
                        hesitation.</p>
                    <p>"This letter is from Mr. Welbeck&mdash;you are his friend&mdash; <lb/> I
                        presume&mdash;perhaps&mdash;a relation?"</p>
                    <p>I was conscious that I had no claim to either of these <lb/> titles, and that
                        I was no more than his servant. My pride <lb/> would not allow me to
                        acknowledge this, and I merely said <lb/> &mdash;"I live with him at
                        present, Madam."</p>
                    <p>I imagined that this answer did not perfectly satisfy her; <lb/> yet she
                        received it with a certain air of acquiescence. She <lb/> was silent for a
                        few minutes, and then, rising, <reg orig="said&mdash;&quot;Ex-|cuse"
                            >said&mdash;"Excuse</reg>
                        <lb/> me, Sir, for a few minutes. I will write a few words <lb/> to Mr.
                        Welbeck."&mdash;So saying, she withdrew.</p>
                    <p>I returned to the contemplation of the picture. From <lb/> this, however, my
                        attention was quickly diverted by a paper <lb/> that lay on the mantle. A
                        single glance was sufficient to <lb/> put my blood into motion. I started
                        and laid my hand upon <lb/> the well known packet. It was that which
                        inclosed the <lb/> portrait of Clavering!</p>
                    <p>I unfolded and examined it with eagerness. By what <lb/> miracle came it
                        hither? It was found, together with my <lb/> bundle, two nights before. I
                        had despaired of ever seeing <lb/> it again, and yet, here was the same
                        portrait inclosed in the <lb/> selfsame paper! I have forborne to dwell upon
                        the regret, <lb/> amounting to grief, with which I was affected in <reg
                            orig="conse-|quence">consequence</reg>
                        <lb/> of the loss of this precious relic. My joy on thus <lb/> speedily and
                        unexpectedly regaining it, is not easily <reg orig="des-|cribed"
                            >described</reg>.</p>
                    <p>For a time I did not reflect that to hold it thus in my <lb/> hand was not
                        sufficient to entitle me to repossession. I <lb/> must acquaint this lady
                        with the history of this picture, and <lb/> convince her of my ownership.
                        But how was this to be <lb/> done? Was she connected in any way, by
                        friendship or by <lb/> consanguinity, with that unfortunate youth. If she
                        were, <lb/> some information as to his destiny would be anxiously <lb/>
                        sought. I did not, just then, perceive any impropriety in <lb/> imparting
                        it. If it came into her hands by accident, still it <lb/> will be necessary
                        to relate the mode in which it was lost in <lb/> order to prove my title to
                        it.</p>
                    <p>I now heard her descending footsteps and hastily replaced <lb/> the picture
                        on the mantle. She entered, and presenting me <lb/>
                        <pb n="60" entity="eaf033v2_0073" pid="uva-lib:349380"/> a letter, desired
                        me to deliver it to Mr. Welbeck. I had <lb/> no pretext for deferring my
                        departure; but was unwilling to <lb/> go without obtaining possession of the
                        portrait. An <reg orig="inter-|val">interval</reg>
                        <lb/> of silence and irresolution succeeded. I cast significant <lb/>
                        glances at the spot where it lay, and at length, mustered up <lb/> my
                        strength of mind, and pointing to the paper&mdash;"Madam," <lb/> said I,
                            "<hi rend="italic">there</hi> is something which I recognise to be
                        mine&mdash; <lb/> I know not how it came into your possession, but so lately
                        <lb/> as the day before yesterday, it was in mine. I lost it by a <lb/>
                        strange accident, and as I deem it of inestimable value, I <lb/> hope you
                        will have no objection to restore it."&mdash;</p>
                    <p>During this speech the lady's countenance exhibited <lb/> marks of the utmost
                        perturbation&mdash;"Your picture!" she <reg orig="ex-|claimed"
                            >exclaimed</reg>, <lb/> "You lost it! How? Where? Did you know <lb/>
                        that person? What has become of him?"&mdash;</p>
                    <p>"I knew him well," said I. "That picture was executed <lb/> by himself. He
                        gave it to me with his own hands; and, till <lb/> the moment I unfortunately
                        lost it, it was my dear and <reg orig="per-|petual">perpetual</reg>
                        <lb/> companion."</p>
                    <p>"Good Heaven!" she exclaimed with increasing <reg orig="vehe-|mence"
                            >vehemence</reg>, <lb/> "where did you meet with him? What has become
                        <lb/> of him? Is he dead or alive?"</p>
                    <p>These appearances sufficiently shewed me that Clavering <lb/> and this lady
                        were connected by some ties of tenderness. I <lb/> answered that he was
                        dead; that my mother and myself <lb/> were his attendants and nurses, and
                        that this portrait was <lb/> his legacy to me.</p>
                    <p>This intelligence melted her into tears, and it was some <lb/> time before
                        she recovered strength enough to resume the <lb/> conversation. She then
                        inquired, "When and where was it <lb/> that he died? How did you lose this
                        portrait? It was <lb/> found wrapt in some coarse clothes, lying in a stall
                        in the <lb/> market house, on Saturday evening. Two negro women, <lb/>
                        servants of one of my friends, strolling through the market, <lb/> found it
                        and brought it to their mistress, who, recognising <lb/> the portrait, sent
                        it to me. To whom did that bundle <reg orig="be-|long">belong</reg>? <lb/>
                        Was it yours?"</p>
                    <p>These questions reminded me of the painful predicament <lb/> in which I now
                        stood. I had promised Welbeck to conceal <lb/> from every one my former
                        condition; but to explain in what <lb/> manner this bundle was lost, and how
                        my intercourse with <lb/>
                        <pb n="61" entity="eaf033v2_0074" pid="uva-lib:349381">

                        </pb> Clavering had taken place was to violate this promise. It <lb/> was
                        possible, perhaps, to escape the confession of the truth <lb/> by
                        equivocation. Falsehoods were easily invented, and <lb/> might lead her far
                        away from my true condition; but I was <lb/> wholly unused to equivocation.
                        Never yet had a lie <reg orig="pol-|luted">polluted</reg>
                        <lb/> my lips. I was not weak enough to be ashamed of my <lb/> origin. This
                        lady had an interest in the fate of Clavering, <lb/> and might justly claim
                        all the information which I was able <lb/> to impart. Yet to forget the
                        compact which I had so lately <lb/> made, and an adherence to which might
                        possibly be, in the <lb/> highest degree, beneficial to me and to
                        Welbeck&mdash;I was <reg orig="will-|ing">willing</reg>
                        <lb/> to adhere to it, provided falsehood could be avoided.</p>
                    <p>These thoughts rendered me silent. The pain of my <lb/> embarrassment
                        amounted almost to agony. I felt the <reg orig="keen-|est">keenest</reg>
                        <lb/> regret at my own precipitation in claiming the picture. <lb/> Its
                        value to me was altogether imaginary. The affection <lb/> which this lady
                        had borne the original, whatever was the <lb/> source of that affection,
                        would prompt her to cherish the <lb/> copy, and, however precious it was in
                        my eyes, I should <lb/> cheerfully resign it to her.</p>
                    <p>In the confusion of my thoughts an expedient suggested <lb/> itself
                        sufficiently inartificial and bold.&mdash;"It is true, madam; <lb/> what I
                        have said. I saw him breathe his last. This is his <lb/> only legacy. If you
                        wish it I willingly resign it; but this is <lb/> all that I can now
                        disclose. I am placed in circumstances <lb/> which render it improper to say
                        more."</p>
                    <p>These words were uttered not very distinctly, and the <lb/> lady's vehemence
                        hindered her from noticing them. She <lb/> again repeated her
                        interrogations, to which I returned the <lb/> same answer.</p>
                    <p>At first she expressed the utmost surprise at my conduct. <lb/> From this she
                        descended to some degree of asperity. She <lb/> made rapid allusions to the
                        history of Clavering. He was <lb/> the son of the gentleman who owned the
                        house in which <lb/> Welbeck resided. He was the object of immeasurable
                        <lb/> fondness and indulgence. He had sought permission to <lb/> travel, and
                        this being refused by the absurd timidity of his <lb/> parents, he had twice
                        been frustrated in attempting to <reg orig="em-|bark">embark</reg>
                        <lb/> for Europe clandestinely. They ascribed his <reg

                        <lb/> to a third and successful attempt of this kind, and <lb/>
                        <pb n="62" entity="eaf033v2_0075" pid="uva-lib:349382"/> had exercised
                        anxious and unwearied diligence in <reg orig="endea-|voring"
                            >endeavoring</reg>
                        <lb/> to trace his footsteps. All their efforts had failed. <lb/> One motive
                        for their returning to Europe was the hope of <reg orig="dis-|covering"
                            >discovering</reg>
                        <lb/> some traces of him, as they entertained no doubt <lb/> of his having
                        crossed the ocean. The vehemence of Mrs. <lb/> Wentworth's curiosity as to
                        those particulars of his life and <lb/> death may be easily conceived. My

                        <lb/> this passion.</p>

                        Pleasure <lb/> as well as pain attended my reflections on it. I adhered to
                        <lb/> the promise I had improvidently given to Welbeck, but had <lb/>
                        excited displeasure, and perhaps suspicion in the lady. She <lb/> would find
                        it hard to account for my silence. She would <lb/> probably impute it to
                        perverseness, or imagine it to flow from <lb/> some incident connected with
                        the death of Clavering, <reg orig="calcu-|lated">calculated</reg>
                        <lb/> to give a new edge to her curiosity.</p>
                    <p>It was plain that some connexion subsisted between her <lb/> and Welbeck.
                        Would she drop the subject at the point <lb/> which it had now attained?
                        Would she cease to exert <reg orig="her-|self">herself</reg>
                        <lb/> to extract from me the desired information, or would <lb/> she not
                        rather make Welbeck a party in the cause, and <reg orig="pre-|judice"
                            >prejudice</reg>
                        <lb/> my new friend against me? This was an evil proper, <lb/> by all lawful
                        means, to avoid. I knew of no other <reg orig="expe-|dient">expedient</reg>
                        <lb/> than to confess to him the truth, with regard to <reg

                        in which my adherence <lb/> to my promise had involved me.</p>
                    <p>I found him on my return home and delivered him the <lb/> letter with which I
                        was charged. At the sight of it <reg orig="sur-|prise">surprise</reg>, <lb/>
                        mingled with some uneasiness, appeared in his looks.</p>
                    <p>"What!" said he, in a tone of disappointment, "you then <lb/> saw the
                        lady?"</p>
                    <p>I now remembered his directions to leave my message at <lb/> the door, and
                        apologized for my neglecting them by telling <lb/> my reasons. His chagrin
                        vanished, but not without an <lb/>
                        <pb n="63" entity="eaf033v2_0076" pid="uva-lib:349383"/> apparent effort,
                        and he said that all was well; the affair was <lb/> of no moment.</p>
                    <p>After a pause of preparation, I entreated his attention to <lb/> something
                        which I had to relate. I then detailed the history <lb/> of Clavering and of
                        my late embarrassments. As I went on <lb/> his countenance betokened
                        increasing solicitude. His <reg orig="emo-|tion">emotion</reg>
                        <lb/> was particularly strong when I came to the <reg
                            orig="interrogato-|ries">interrogatories</reg>
                        <lb/> of Mrs. Wentworth in relation to Clavering; but this <lb/> emotion
                        gave way to profound surprise when I related the <lb/> manner in which I had
                        eluded her inquiries. I concluded <lb/> with observing, that when I promised
                        forbearance on the <lb/> subject of my own adventures, I had not foreseen
                        any <reg orig="exi-|gence">exigence</reg>
                        <lb/> which would make an adherence to my promise <reg orig="diffi-|cult"
                            >difficult</reg>
                        <lb/> or inconvenient; that, if his interest was promoted by <lb/> my
                        silence, I was still willing to maintain it, and requested his <lb/>
                        directions how to conduct myself on this occasion.</p>
                    <p>He appeared to ponder deeply and with much perplexity <lb/> on what I had
                        said. When he spoke there was hesitation <lb/> in his manner and circuity in
                        his expressions, that proved <lb/> him to have something in his thoughts,
                        which he knew not <lb/> how to communicate. He frequently paused; but my
                            <reg orig="an-|swers">answers</reg>
                        <lb/> and remarks, occasionally given, appeared to deter him <lb/> from the
                        revelation of his purpose. Our discourse ended, <lb/> for the present, by
                        his desiring me to persist in my present <lb/> plan; I should suffer no
                        inconveniences from it, since it <lb/> would be my own fault if an interview
                        again took place <reg orig="be-|tween">between</reg>
                        <lb/> the lady and me; meanwhile he should see her and <lb/> effectually
                        silence her inquiries.</p>
                    <p>I ruminated not superficially or briefly on this dialogue. <lb/> By what
                        means would he silence her inquiries? He surely <lb/> meant not to mislead
                        her by fallacious representations? Some <lb/> inquietude now crept into my
                        thoughts. I began to form <lb/> conjectures as to the nature of the scheme
                        to which my <reg orig="sup-|pression">suppression</reg>
                        <lb/> of the truth was to be thus made subservient. It <lb/> seemed as if I
                        were walking in the dark and might rush into <lb/> snares or drop into pits
                        before I was aware of my danger. <lb/> Each moment accumulated my doubts,
                        and I cherished a <lb/> secret foreboding that the event would prove my new
                            <reg orig="situa-|tion">situation</reg>
                        <lb/> to be far less fortunate than I had, at first, fondly, <reg
                            orig="be-|lieved">believed</reg>. <lb/> The question now occurred, with
                        painful repetition, <lb/> who and what was Welbeck? What was his relation to <lb/>
                        <pb n="64" entity="eaf033v2_0077" pid="uva-lib:349384"/> this foreign lady?
                        What was the service for which I was <lb/> to be employed?</p>
                    <p>I could not be contented without a solution of these <reg orig="mys-|teries"
                            >mysteries</reg>. <lb/> Why should I not lay my soul open before my new
                        <lb/> friend? Considering my situation, would he regard my <lb/> fears and
                        my surmises as criminal? I felt that they <reg orig="origina-|ted"
                            >originated</reg>
                        <lb/> in laudable habits and views. My peace of mind <reg orig="de-|pended"
                            >depended</reg>
                        <lb/> on the favorable verdict which conscience should <lb/> pass on my
                        proceedings. I saw the emptiness of fame and <lb/> luxury, when put in the
                        balance against the recompense of <lb/> virtue. Never would I purchase the
                        blandishments of <reg orig="adu-|lation">adulation</reg>
                        <lb/> and the glare of opulence at the price of my honesty.</p>
                    <p>Amidst these reflections the dinner-hour arrived. The <lb/> lady and Welbeck
                        were present. A new train of <reg orig="senti-|ments">sentiments</reg>
                        <lb/> now occupied my mind. I regarded them both with <lb/> inquisitive
                        eyes. I cannot well account for the revolution <lb/> which had taken place
                        in my mind. Perhaps it was a proof <lb/> of the capriciousness of my temper,
                        or it was merely the fruit <lb/> of my profound ignorance of life and
                        manners. <reg orig="Whenceso-|ever">Whencesoever</reg>
                        <lb/> it arose, certain it is that I contemplated the scene <reg
                            orig="be-|fore">before</reg>
                        <lb/> me with altered eyes. Its order and pomp was no <lb/> longer the
                        parent of tranquillity and awe. My wild <reg orig="rev-|eries"
                            >reveries</reg>
                        <lb/> of inheriting this splendor and appropriating the <reg

                        <lb/> of this nymph, I now regarded as lunatic hope and <lb/> childish
                        folly. Education and nature had qualified me for <lb/> a different scene.
                        This might be the mask of misery and <lb/> the structure of vice.</p>
                    <p>My companions as well as myself were silent during the <lb/> meal. The lady
                        retired as soon as it was finished. My <lb/> inexplicable melancholy
                        increased. It did not pass <reg orig="unno-|ticed">unnoticed</reg>
                        <lb/> by Welbeck, who inquired, with an air of kindness, into <lb/> the
                        cause of my visible dejection. I am almost ashamed <lb/> to relate to what
                        extremes my folly transported me. Instead <lb/> of answering him I was weak
                        enough to shed tears.</p>
                    <p>This excited afresh his surprise and his sympathy. He <lb/> renewed his
                        inquiries; my heart was full, but how to <reg orig="disbur-|then"
                            >disburthen</reg>
                        <lb/> it I knew not. At length, with some difficulty, I <reg
                            orig="ex-|pressed">expressed</reg>
                        <lb/> my wishes to leave his house and return into the <lb/> country.</p>
                    <p>"What," he asked, "had occurred to suggest this new <lb/> plan? What motive
                        could incite me to bury myself in rustic <lb/>
                        <pb n="65" entity="eaf033v2_0078" pid="uva-lib:349385">

                        </pb> obscurity? How did I purpose to dispose of myself? Had <lb/> some new
                        friend sprung up more able or more willing to <lb/> benefit me than he had
                        been?"</p>
                    <p>"No," I answered, "I have no relation who would own <lb/> me, or friend who
                        would protect. If I went into the <reg orig="coun-|try">country</reg>
                        <lb/> it would be to the toilsome occupations of a day laborer; <lb/> but
                        even that was better than my present situation."</p>
                    <p>"This opinion," he observed, "must be newly formed. <lb/> What was there
                        irksome or offensive in my present mode <lb/> of life."</p>
                    <p>That this man condescended to expostulate with me; to <lb/> dissuade me from
                        my new plan; and to enumerate the <reg orig="bene-|fits">benefits</reg>
                        <lb/> which he was willing to confer, penetrated my heart <lb/> with
                        gratitude. I could not but acknowledge that leisure <lb/> and literature,
                        copious and elegant accommodation were <lb/> valuable for their own sake;
                        that all the delights of <reg orig="sensa-|tion">sensation</reg>
                        <lb/> and refinements of intelligence, were comprised within <lb/> my
                        present sphere, and would be nearly wanting in that <lb/> to which I was
                        going. I felt temporary compunction for my <lb/> folly, and determined to
                        adopt a different deportment. I <lb/> could not prevail upon myself to
                        unfold the true cause of <lb/> my dejection, and permitted him therefore to
                        ascribe it to <lb/> a kind of homesickness; to inexperience; and to that
                            <reg orig="ig-|norance">ignorance</reg>
                        <lb/> which, on being ushered into a new scene, is <reg orig="op-|pressed"
                            >oppressed</reg>
                        <lb/> with a sensation of forlornness. He remarked that <lb/> these chimeras
                        would vanish before the influence of time, <lb/> and company, and
                        occupation. On the next week he <lb/> would furnish me with employment;
                        meanwhile he would <lb/> introduce me into company, where intelligence and
                        vivacity <lb/> would combine to dispel my glooms.</p>
                    <p>As soon as we separated, my disquietudes returned. I <lb/> contended with
                        them in vain, and finally resolved to abandon <lb/> my present situation.
                        When and how this purpose was to <lb/> be effected I knew not. That was to
                        be the theme of future <lb/> deliberation.</p>
                    <p>Evening having arrived, Welbeck proposed to me to <reg orig="ac-|company"
                            >accompany</reg>
                        <lb/> him on a visit to one of his friends. I cheerfully <lb/> accepted the
                        invitation and went with him to your friend <lb/> Mr. Wortley's. A numerous
                        party was assembled, chiefly <lb/> of the female sex. I was introduced by
                        Welbeck by the <lb/>

                        <lb/> I did not fail to attend to what passed on this <reg orig="occa-|sion"
                            >occasion</reg>. <lb/> I remarked that the utmost deference was paid to
                        my <lb/> companion, on whom his entrance into this company <reg
                            orig="ap-|peared">appeared</reg>
                        <lb/> to operate like magic. His eyes sparkled; his <reg orig="fea-|tures"
                            >features</reg>
                        <lb/> expanded into a benign serenity; and his wonted <reg orig="re-|serve"
                            >reserve</reg>
                        <lb/> gave place to a torrent-like and overflowing elocution.</p>
                    <p>I marked this change in his deportment with the utmost <lb/> astonishment. So
                        great was it, that I could hardly persuade <lb/> myself that it was the same
                        person. A mind thus <reg orig="suscep-|tible">susceptible</reg>
                        <lb/> of new impressions must be, I conceived, of a <reg orig="won-|derful"
                            >wonderful</reg>
                        <lb/> texture. Nothing was further from my expectations <lb/> than that this
                        vivacity was mere dissimulation and would <lb/> take its leave of him when
                        he left the company; yet this I <lb/> found to be the case. The door was no
                        sooner closed after <lb/> him than his accustomed solemnity returned. He
                        spake <lb/> little, and that little was delivered with emphatical and <lb/>
                        monosyllabic brevity.</p>
                    <p>We returned home at a late hour, and I immediately <lb/> retired to my
                        chamber, not so much from the desire of <reg orig="re-|pose">repose</reg>
                        <lb/> as in order to enjoy and pursue my own reflections <lb/> without
                        interruption.</p>
                    <p>The condition of my mind was considerably remote from <lb/> happiness. I was
                        placed in a scene that furnished fuel to <lb/> my curiosity. This passion is
                        a source of pleasure, <reg orig="pro-|vided">provided</reg>
                        <lb/> its gratification be practicable. I had no reason, in <lb/> my present
                        circumstances, to despair of knowledge; yet <lb/> suspicion and anxiety
                        beset me. I thought upon the delay <lb/> and toil which the removal of my
                        ignorance would cost, and <lb/> reaped only pain and fear from the
                        reflection.</p>
                    <p>The air was remarkably sultry. Lifted sashes and lofty <lb/> ceilings were
                        insufficient to attemper it. The perturbation <lb/> of my thoughts affected
                        my body, and the heat which <reg orig="op-|pressed">oppressed</reg>
                        <lb/> me, was aggravated, by my restlessness, almost <lb/> into fever. Some
                        hours were thus painfully past, when I <lb/> recollected that the bath,
                        erected in the court below, <reg orig="con-|tained">contained</reg>
                        <lb/> a sufficient antidote to the scorching influence of the <lb/>
                        atmosphere.</p>
                    <p>I rose, and descended the stairs softly, that I might not <lb/> alarm Welbeck
                        and the lady, who occupied the two rooms <lb/> on the second floor. I
                        proceeded to the bath, and filling <lb/>
                        <pb n="67" entity="eaf033v2_0080" pid="uva-lib:349387"/> the reservoir with
                        water, speedily dissipated the heat that <lb/> incommoded me. Of all species
                        of sensual gratification, <lb/> that was the most delicious; and I continued
                        for a long <lb/> time, laving my limbs and moistening my hair. In the <lb/>
                        midst of this amusement, I noticed the approach of day, <lb/> and
                        immediately saw the propriety of returning to my <lb/> chamber. I returned
                        with the same caution which I had <lb/> used in descending; my feet were
                        bare, so that it was easy <lb/> to proceed unattended by the smallest signal
                        of my progress.</p>
                    <p>I had reached the carpetted staircase, and was slowly <lb/> ascending, when I
                        heard, within the chamber that was <reg orig="oc-|cupied">occupied</reg>
                        <lb/> by the lady, a noise, as of some one moving. <lb/> Though not
                        conscious of having acted improperly, yet I <lb/> felt reluctance to be
                        seen. There was no reason to suppose <lb/> that this sound was connected
                        with the detection of me, in <lb/> this situation; yet I acted as if this
                        reason existed, and made <lb/> haste to pass the door and gain the second
                        flight of steps.</p>
                    <p>I was unable to accomplish my design, when the <reg orig="cham-|ber"
                            >chamber</reg>
                        <lb/> door slowly opened, and Welbeck, with a light in his <lb/> hand, came
                        out. I was abashed and disconcerted at this <lb/> interview. He started at
                        seeing me; but discovering in an <lb/> instant who it was, his face assumed
                        an expression in which <lb/> shame and anger were powerfully blended. He
                        seemed on <lb/> the point of opening his mouth to rebuke me; but suddenly
                        <lb/> checking himself, he said, in a tone of mildness, "How is <lb/>
                        this?&mdash;Whence come you?"</p>
                    <p>His emotion seemed to communicate itself, with an <reg orig="elec-|trical"
                            >electrical</reg>
                        <lb/> rapidity, to my heart. My tongue faltered while I <lb/> made some
                        answer. I said, "I had been seeking relief <lb/> from the heat of the
                        weather, in the bath." He heard my <lb/> explanation in silence; and, after
                        a moment's pause, passed <lb/> into his own room, and shut himself in. I
                        hastened to my <lb/> chamber.</p>
                    <p>A different observer might have found in these <reg orig="circum-|stances"
                            >circumstances</reg>
                        <lb/> no food for his suspicion or his wonder. To me, <lb/> however, they
                        suggested vague and tumultuous ideas.</p>
                    <p>As I strode across the room I repeated, "This woman <lb/> is his daughter.
                        What proof have I of that? He once <reg orig="as-|serted">asserted</reg>
                        <lb/> it; and has frequently uttered allusions and hints <lb/> from which no
                        other inference could be drawn. The <reg orig="cham-|ber">chamber</reg>
                        <lb/> from which he came, in an hour devoted to sleep, was <lb/>
                        <pb n="68" entity="eaf033v2_0081" pid="uva-lib:349388"/> hers. For what end
                        could a visit like this be paid? A <reg orig="pa-|rent">parent</reg>
                        <lb/> may visit his child at all seasons, without a crime. On <lb/> seeing
                        me, methought his features indicated more than <reg orig="sur-|prise"
                            >surprise</reg>. <lb/> A keen interpreter would be apt to suspect a <reg
                            orig="con-|sciousness">consciousness</reg>
                        <lb/> of wrong. What if this woman be not his child! <lb/> How shall their
                        relationship be ascertained?"</p>
                    <p>I was summoned at the customary hour to breakfast. <lb/> My mind was full of
                        ideas connected with this incident. I <lb/> was not endowed with sufficient
                        firmness to propose the <lb/> cool and systematic observation of this man's
                        deportment. <lb/> I felt as if the state of my mind could not but be evident
                        to <lb/> him; and experienced in myself all the confusion which <lb/> this
                        discovery was calculated to produce in him. I would <lb/> have willingly
                        excused myself from meeting him; but that <lb/> was impossible.</p>
                    <p>At breakfast, after the usual salutations, nothing was said. <lb/> For a time
                        I scarcely lifted my eyes from the table. <reg orig="Steal-|ing"
                            >Stealing</reg>
                        <lb/> a glance at Welbeck, I discovered in his features nothing <lb/> but
                        his wonted gravity. He appeared occupied with <lb/> thoughts that had no
                        relation to last night's adventure. <lb/> This encouraged me; and I
                        gradually recovered my <reg orig="com-|posure">composure</reg>. <lb/> Their
                        inattention to me allowed me occasionally <lb/> to throw scrutinizing and
                        comparing glances at the face of <lb/> each.</p>
                    <p>The relationship of parent and child is commonly <reg orig="disco-|verable"
                            >discoverable</reg>
                        <lb/> in the visage; but the child may resemble either of <lb/> its parents,
                        yet have no feature in common with both. Here <lb/> outlines, surfaces and
                        hues were in absolute contrariety. <lb/> That kindred subsisted between them
                        was possible, <reg orig="not-|withstanding">notwithstanding</reg>
                        <lb/> this dissimilitude; but this circumstance <reg orig="con-|tributed"
                            >contributed</reg>
                        <lb/> to envenom my suspicions.</p>
                    <p>Breakfast being finished, Welbeck cast an eye of <reg orig="invita-|tion"
                            >invitation</reg>
                        <lb/> to the piano forte. The lady rose to comply with his <lb/> request. My
                        eye chanced to be, at that moment, fixed on <lb/> her. In stepping to the
                        instrument some motion or <reg orig="appear-|ance">appearance</reg>
                        <lb/> awakened a thought in my mind, which affected my <lb/> feelings like
                        the shock of an earthquake.</p>
                    <p>I have too slight acquaintance with the history of the <lb/> passions to
                        truly explain the emotion which now throbbed in <lb/> my veins. I had been a
                        stranger to what is called love. <lb/> From subsequent reflection, I have
                        contracted a suspicion, <lb/>
                        <pb n="69" entity="eaf033v2_0082" pid="uva-lib:349389"/> that the sentiment
                        with which I regarded this lady was not <lb/> untinctured from this source,
                        and that hence arose the <reg orig="tur-|bulence">turbulence</reg>
                        <lb/> of my feelings, on observing what I construed into <lb/> marks of
                        pregnancy. The evidence afforded me was slight; <lb/> yet it exercised an
                        absolute sway over my belief.</p>
                    <p>It was well that this suspicion had not been sooner <reg orig="ex-|cited"
                            >excited</reg>. <lb/> Now civility did not require my stay in the <reg
                            orig="apart-|ment">apartment</reg>, <lb/> and nothing but flight could
                        conceal the state of my <lb/> mind. I hastened, therefore, to a distance,
                        and shrouded <lb/> myself in the friendly secrecy of my own chamber.</p>
                    <p>The constitution of my mind is doubtless singular and <lb/> perverse; yet
                        that opinion, perhaps, is the fruit of my <reg orig="igno-|rance"
                            >ignorance</reg>. <lb/> It may by no means be uncommon for men to <lb/>
                        <hi rend="italic">fashion</hi> their conclusions in opposition to evidence
                        and <hi rend="italic"><reg orig="pro-|bability">probability</reg>,</hi>
                        <lb/> and so as to feed their malice and subvert their <lb/> happiness. Thus
                        it was, in an eminent degree, in my case. <lb/> The simple fact was
                        connected, in my mind, with a train of <lb/> the most hateful consequences.
                        The depravity of Welbeck <lb/> was inferred from it. The charms of this
                        angelic woman <lb/> were tarnished and withered. I had formerly surveyed her
                        <lb/> as a precious and perfect monument, but now it was a scene <lb/> of
                        ruin and blast.</p>
                    <p>This had been a source of sufficient anguish; but this <lb/> was not all. I
                        recollected that the claims of a parent had <lb/> been urged. Will you
                        believe that these claims were now <lb/> admitted, and that they heightened
                        the iniquity of Welbeck <lb/> into the blackest and most stupendous of all
                        crimes? These <lb/> ideas were necessarily transient. Conclusions more <reg
                            orig="con-|formable">conformable</reg>
                        <lb/> to appearances succeeded. This lady might have <lb/> been lately
                        reduced to widowhood. The recent loss of a <lb/> beloved companion would
                        sufficiently account for her <reg orig="dejec-|tion">dejection</reg>, <lb/>
                        and make her present situation compatible with duty.</p>
                    <p>By this new train of ideas I was somewhat comforted. I <lb/> saw the folly of
                        precipitate inferences, and the injustice of <lb/> my atrocious imputations,
                        and acquired some degree of <lb/> patience in my present state of
                        uncertainty. My heart was <lb/> lightened of its wonted burthen, and I
                        labored to invent <lb/> some harmless explication of the scene that I had
                        witnessed <lb/> the preceding night.</p>
                    <p>At dinner Welbeck appeared as usual, but not the lady. <lb/> I ascribed her
                        absence to some casual indisposition, and <lb/>
                        <pb n="70" entity="eaf033v2_0083" pid="uva-lib:349390"/> ventured to inquire
                        into the state of her health. My <reg orig="com-|panion">companion</reg>
                        <lb/> said she was well, but that she had left the city for <lb/> a month or
                        two, finding the heat of summer inconvenient <lb/> where she was. This was
                        no unplausible reason for <reg orig="retire-|ment">retirement</reg>. <lb/> A
                        candid mind would have acquiesced in this <reg orig="repre-|sentation"
                            >representation</reg>, <lb/> and found in it nothing inconsistent with a
                            <reg orig="suppo-|sition">supposition</reg>
                        <lb/> respecting the cause of appearances favorable to her <lb/> character;
                        but otherwise was I affected. The uneasiness <lb/> which had flown for a
                        moment, returned, and I sunk into <lb/> gloomy silence.</p>
                    <p>From this I was roused by my patron, who requested <lb/> me to deliver a
                        billet, which he put into my hand, at the <lb/> counting-house of Mr.
                        Thetford, and to bring him an <reg orig="an-|swer">answer</reg>. <lb/> This
                        message was speedily performed. I entered <lb/> a large building by the
                        river side. A spacious apartment <lb/> presented itself, well furnished with
                        pipes and hogsheads. <lb/> In one corner was a smaller room, in which a
                        gentleman <lb/> was busy at writing. I advanced to the door of the room,
                        <lb/> but was there met by a young person, who received my <lb/> paper, and
                        delivered it to him within. I stood still at the <lb/> door; but was near
                        enough to overhear what would pass <lb/> between them.</p>
                    <p>The letter was laid upon the desk, and presently he that <lb/> sat at it
                        lifted his eyes, and glanced at the superscription. <lb/> He scarcely spoke
                        above a whisper, but his words, <reg orig="never-|theless"
                            >nevertheless</reg>, <lb/> were clearly distinguishable. I did not call
                        to mind <lb/> the sound of his voice, but his words called up a train of
                        <lb/> recollections.</p>
                    <p>"Lo!" said he, carelessly, "this from the <hi rend="italic">Nabob!</hi>"</p>
                    <p>An incident so slight as this was sufficient to open a <reg orig="spa-|cious"
                            >spacious</reg>
                        <lb/> scene of meditation. This little word, half whispered <lb/> in a
                        thoughtless mood, was a key to unlock an extensive <lb/> cabinet of secrets.
                        Thetford was probably indifferent <lb/> whether his exclamation were
                        overheard. Little did he <lb/> think on the inferences which would be built
                        upon it.</p>
                    <p>"The Nabob!" By this appellation had some one been <lb/> denoted in the
                        chamber dialogue, of which I had been an <lb/> unsuspected auditor. The man
                        who pretended poverty, <lb/> and yet gave proofs of inordinate wealth; whom
                        it was <lb/> pardonable to defraud of thirty thousand dollars; first, <reg
                            orig="be-|cause">because</reg>
                        <lb/> the loss of that sum would be trivial to one opulent <lb/>
                        <pb n="71" entity="eaf033v2_0084" pid="uva-lib:349391"/> as he; and
                        secondly, because he was imagined to have <lb/> acquired this opulence by
                        other than honest methods. <reg orig="In-|stead">Instead</reg>
                        <lb/> of forthwith returning home, I wandered into the fields, <lb/> to
                        indulge myself in the new thoughts which were produced <lb/> by this
                        occurrence.</p>
                    <p>I entertained no doubt that the person alluded to was my <lb/> patron. No new
                        light was thrown upon his character; <reg orig="un-|less">unless</reg>
                        <lb/> something were deducible from the charge vaguely <lb/> made, that his
                        wealth was the fruit of illicit practices. He <lb/> was opulent, and the
                        sources of his wealth were unknown, <lb/> if not to the rest of the
                        community, at least to Thetford. <lb/> But here had a plot been laid. The
                        fortune of <reg orig="Thet-|ford's">Thetford's</reg>
                        <lb/> brother was to rise from the success of artifices, of <lb/> which the
                        credulity of Welbeck was to be the victim. <lb/> To detect, and to
                        counterwork this plot was obviously my <lb/> duty. My interference might now
                        indeed be too late to <lb/> be useful; but this was at least to be
                        ascertained by <reg orig="expe-|riment">experiment</reg>.</p>
                    <p>How should my intention be effected? I had hitherto <lb/> concealed from
                        Welbeck my adventures at Thetford's house. <lb/> These it was now necessary
                        to disclose, and to mention the <lb/> recent occurrence. My deductions, in
                        consequence of my <lb/> ignorance, might be erroneous; but of their truth
                        his <reg orig="know-|ledge">knowledge</reg>
                        <lb/> of his own affairs would enable him to judge. It was <lb/> possible
                        that Thetford and he whose chamber conversation <lb/> I had overheard, were
                        different persons. I endeavored in <lb/> vain to ascertain their identity by
                        a comparison of their <lb/> voices. The words lately heard, my remembrance
                        did not <lb/> enable me certainly to pronounce to be uttered by the same
                        <lb/> organs.</p>
                    <p>This uncertainty was of little moment. It sufficed that <lb/> Welbeck was
                        designated by this appellation, and that <lb/> therefore he was proved to be
                        the subject of some <reg orig="fraudu-|lent">fraudulent</reg>
                        <lb/> proceeding. The information that I possessed it was <lb/> my duty to
                        communicate as expeditiously as possible. I <lb/> was resolved to employ the
                        first opportunity that offered for <lb/> this end.</p>
                    <p>My meditations had been ardently pursued, and, when I <lb/> recalled my
                        attention, I found myself bewildered among <lb/> fields and fences. It was
                        late before I extricated myself <lb/> from unknown paths, and reached

                    <p>I entered the parlor; but Welbeck was not there. A <lb/> table, with
                        tea-equipage for one person was set; from which <lb/> I inferred that
                        Welbeck was engaged abroad. This belief <lb/> was confirmed by the report of
                        the servant. He could not <lb/> inform me where his master was, but merely
                        that he should <lb/> not take tea at home. This incident was a source of
                            <reg orig="vexa-|tion">vexation</reg>
                        <lb/> and impatience. I knew not but that delay would be <lb/> of the utmost
                        moment to the safety of my friend. Wholly <lb/> unacquainted as I was with
                        the nature of his contracts with <lb/> Thetford, I could not decide whether
                        a single hour would <lb/> not avail to obviate the evils that threatened
                        him. Had I <lb/> known whither to trace his footsteps, I should certainly
                        have <lb/> sought an immediate interview; but, as it was, I was obliged
                        <lb/> to wait with what patience I could collect, for his return to <lb/>
                        his own house.</p>
                    <p>I waited hour after hour in vain. The sun declined, and <lb/> the shades of
                        evening descended; but Welbeck was still at <lb/> a distance.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="small-caps">Welbeck</hi> did not return though hour succeeded hour
                        till <lb/> the clock struck ten. I inquired of the servants, who <reg
                            orig="in-|formed">informed</reg>
                        <lb/> me that their master was not accustomed to stay out <lb/> so late. I
                        seated myself at a table, in a parlor, on which <lb/> there stood a light,
                        and listened for the signal of his coming, <lb/> either by the sound of
                        steps on the pavement without or by <lb/> a peal from the bell. The silence
                        was uninterrupted and <lb/> profound, and each minute added to my sum of
                        impatience <lb/> and anxiety.</p>
                    <p>To relieve myself from the heat of the weather, which <lb/> was aggravated by
                        the condition of my thoughts, as well as <lb/> to beguile this tormenting
                        interval, it occurred to me to <lb/> betake myself to the bath. I left the
                        candle where it stood, <lb/> and imagined that even in the bath, I should
                        hear the sound <lb/> of the bell which would be rung upon his arrival at the
                        door.</p>
                    <p>No such signal occurred, and, after taking this <reg orig="refresh-|ment"
                            >refreshment</reg>, <lb/> I prepared to return to my post. The parlor
                        was <lb/>
                        <pb n="73" entity="eaf033v2_0086" pid="uva-lib:349393">

                        </pb> still unoccupied, but this was not all; the candle I had left <lb/>
                        upon the table was gone. This was an inexplicable <reg orig="circum-|stance"
                            >circumstance</reg>. <lb/> On my promise to wait for their master, the
                            <reg orig="ser-|vants">servants</reg>
                        <lb/> had retired to bed. No signal of any one's entrance <lb/> had been
                        given. The street door was locked and the key <lb/> hung at its customary
                        place, upon the wall. What was I <lb/> to think? It was obvious to suppose
                        that the candle had been <lb/> removed by a domestic; but their footsteps
                        could not be <lb/> traced, and I was not sufficiently acquainted with the
                        house <lb/> to find the way, especially immersed in darkness, to their <lb/>
                        chamber. One measure, however, it was evidently proper <lb/> to take, which
                        was to supply myself, anew, with a light. <lb/> This was instantly
                        performed; but what was next to be <lb/> done?</p>
                    <p>I was weary of the perplexities in which I was <reg orig="em-|broiled"
                            >embroiled</reg>. <lb/> I saw no avenue to escape from them but that
                        <lb/> which led me to the bosom of nature and to my ancient <lb/>
                        occupations. For a moment I was tempted to resume my <lb/> rustic garb, and,
                        on that very hour, to desert this habitation. <lb/> One thing only detained
                        me; the desire to apprize my patron <lb/> of the treachery of Thetford. For
                        this end I was anxious <lb/> to obtain an interview; but now I reflected
                        that this <reg orig="informa-|tion">information</reg>, <lb/> could, by other
                        means be imparted. Was it not <reg orig="suffi-|cient">sufficient</reg>
                        <lb/> to write him briefly these particulars, and leave him to <lb/> profit
                        by the knowledge? Thus, I might, likewise, acquaint <lb/> him with my
                        motives for thus abruptly and unseasonably <lb/> deserting his service.</p>
                    <p>To the execution of this scheme pen and paper were <lb/> necessary. The
                        business of writing was performed in the <lb/> chamber on the third story. I
                        had been hitherto denied <lb/> access to this room. In it was a show of
                        papers and books. <lb/> Here it was that the task, for which I had been
                        retained, <lb/> was to be performed; but I was to enter it and leave it only
                        <lb/> in company with Welbeck. For what reasons, I asked, <lb/> was this
                        procedure to be adopted?</p>
                    <p>The influence of prohibitions and an appearance of <reg orig="dis-|guise"
                            >disguise</reg>
                        <lb/> in awakening curiosity, are well known. My mind <lb/> fastened upon
                        the idea of this room with an unusual degree <lb/> of intenseness. I had
                        seen it but for a moment. Many of <lb/> Welbeck's hours were spent in it. It
                        was not to be inferred <lb/>
                        <pb n="74" entity="eaf033v2_0087" pid="uva-lib:349394"/> that they were
                        consumed in idleness; what then was the <lb/> nature of his employment over
                        which a veil of such <reg orig="impene-|trable">impenetrable</reg>
                        <lb/> secrecy was cast?</p>
                    <p>Will you wonder that the design of entering this recess <lb/> was insensibly
                        formed? Possibly it was locked, but its <lb/> accessibleness was likewise
                        possible. I meant not the <reg orig="com-|mission">commission</reg>
                        <lb/> of any crime. My principal purpose was to procure <lb/> the implements
                        of writing, which were elsewhere not to be <lb/> found. I should neither
                        unseal papers nor open drawers. <lb/> I would merely take a survey of the
                        volumes and attend to <lb/> the objects that spontaneously presented
                        themselves to my <lb/> view. In this there surely was nothing criminal or
                            <reg orig="blame-|worthy">blameworthy</reg>. <lb/> Meanwhile I was not
                        unmindful of the sudden <lb/> disappearance of the candle. This incident
                        filled my bosom <lb/> with the inquietudes of fear and the perturbations of
                        wonder.</p>
                    <p>Once more I paused to catch any sound that might arise <lb/> from without.
                        All was still. I seized the candle and <reg orig="pre-|pared">prepared</reg>
                        <lb/> to mount the stairs. I had not reached the first <reg orig="land-|ing"
                            >landing</reg>
                        <lb/> when I called to mind my midnight meeting with <reg orig="Wel-|beck"
                            >Welbeck</reg>
                        <lb/> at the door of his daughter's chamber. The chamber <lb/> was now
                        desolate; perhaps it was accessible; if so no injury <lb/> was done by
                        entering it. My curiosity was strong, but it <lb/> pictured to itself no
                        precise object. Three steps would bear <lb/> me to the door. The trial,
                        whether it was fastened, might <lb/> be made in a moment; and I readily
                        imagined that <reg orig="some-|thing">something</reg>
                        <lb/> might be found within to reward the trouble of <reg
                            orig="ex-|amination">examination</reg>. <lb/> The door yielded to my
                        hand and I entered.</p>
                    <p>No remarkable object was discoverable. The apartment <lb/> was supplied with
                        the usual furniture. I bent my steps <lb/> towards a table over which a
                        mirror was suspended. My <lb/> glances, which roved with swiftness from one
                        object to <lb/> another, shortly lighted on a miniature portrait that hung
                        <lb/> near. I scrutinized it with eagerness. It was impossible to <lb/>
                        overlook its resemblance to my own visage. This was so <lb/> great that, for
                        a moment, I imagined myself to have been the <lb/> original from which it
                        had been drawn. This flattering <reg orig="con-|ception">conception</reg>
                        <lb/> yielded place to a belief merely of similitude between <lb/> me and
                        the genuine original.</p>
                    <p>The thoughts which this opinion was fitted to produce <lb/> were suspended by
                        a new object. A small volume, that <lb/> had, apparently, been much used,
                        lay upon the toilet. I <lb/>
                        <pb n="75" entity="eaf033v2_0088" pid="uva-lib:349395"/> opened it, and
                        found it to contain some of the Dramas of <lb/> Apostolo Zeno. I turned over
                        the leaves; a written paper <lb/> saluted my sight. A single glance informed
                        me that it was <lb/> English. For the present I was insensible to all
                        motives <lb/> that would command me to forbear. I seized the paper <lb/>
                        with an intention to peruse it.</p>
                    <p>At that moment a stunning report was heard. It was loud <lb/> enough to shake
                        the walls of the apartment, and abrupt <lb/> enough to throw me into
                        tremors. I dropped the book <lb/> and yielded for a moment to confusion and
                        surprise. From <lb/> what quarter it came, I was unable accurately to
                        determine; <lb/> but there could be no doubt, from its loudness, that it was
                        <lb/> near, and even in the house. It was no less manifest that <lb/> the
                        sound arose from the discharge of a pistol. Some hand <lb/> must have drawn
                        the trigger. I recollected the <reg orig="disappear-|ance"
                            >disappearance</reg>
                        <lb/> of the candle from the room below. Instantly a <reg
                            orig="sup-|position">supposition</reg>
                        <lb/> darted into my mind which made my hair rise and <lb/> my teeth
                        chatter.</p>
                    <p>"This," I said, "is the deed of Welbeck. He entered <lb/> while I was absent
                        from the room; he hied to his chamber; <lb/> and, prompted by some unknown
                        instigation, has inflicted <lb/> on himself death!" This idea had a tendency
                        to palsy my <lb/> limbs and my thoughts. Some time passed in painful and
                        <lb/> tumultuous fluctuation. My aversion to this catastrophe, <lb/> rather
                        than a belief of being, by that means, able to pervent <lb/> or repair the
                        evil, induced me to attempt to enter his <reg orig="cham-|ber"
                        >chamber</reg>. <lb/> It was possible that my conjectures were
                        erroneous.</p>
                    <p>The door of his room was locked. I knocked; I <reg orig="de-|manded"
                            >demanded</reg>
                        <lb/> entrance in a low voice; I put my eye and my ear <lb/> to the key-hole
                        and the crevices; nothing could be heard or <lb/> seen. It was unavoidable
                        to conclude that no one was <lb/> within; yet the effluvia of gun-powder was
                        perceptible.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps the room above had been the scene of this <reg orig="catas-|trophe"
                            >catastrophe</reg>. <lb/> I ascended the second flight of stairs. I <reg
                            orig="approach-|ed">approached</reg>
                        <lb/> the door. No sound could be caught by my most vigilant <lb/>
                        attention. I put out the light that I carried, and was then <lb/> able to
                        perceive that there was light within the room. I <lb/> scarcely knew how to
                        act. For some minutes I paused at <lb/> the door. I spoke, and requested
                        permission to enter. My <lb/> words were succeeded by a death-like
                        stillness. At length I <lb/> ventured softly to withdraw the bolt; to open
                        and to advance <lb/>
                        <pb n="76" entity="eaf033v2_0089" pid="uva-lib:349396"/> within the room.
                        Nothing could exceed the horror of my <lb/> expectation; yet I was startled
                        by the scene that I beheld.</p>
                    <p>In a chair, whose back was placed against the front wall, <lb/> sat Welbeck.
                        My entrance alarmed him not, nor roused <lb/> him from the stupor into which
                        he was plunged. He rested <lb/> his hands upon his knees, and his eyes were
                        riveted to <reg orig="some-|thing">something</reg>
                        <lb/> that lay, at the distance of a few feet before him, on <lb/> the
                        floor. A second glance was sufficient to inform me of <lb/> what nature this
                        object was. It was the body of a man, <lb/> bleeding, ghastly, and still
                        exhibiting the marks of <reg orig="convul-|sion">convulsion</reg>
                        <lb/> and agony!</p>
                    <p>I shall omit to describe the shock which a spectacle like <lb/> this
                        communicated to my unpractised senses. I was nearly <lb/> as panic struck
                        and powerless as Welbeck himself. I gazed, <lb/> without power of speech, at
                        one time, at Welbeck; then <lb/> I fixed terrified eyes on the distorted
                        features of the dead. <lb/> At length, Welbeck, recovering from his reverie,
                        looked <lb/> up, as if to see who it was that had entered. No surprise,
                        <lb/> no alarm, was betrayed by him on seeing me. He <reg
                            orig="mani-|fested">manifested</reg>
                        <lb/> no desire or intention to interrupt the fearful silence.</p>
                    <p>My thoughts wandered in confusion and terror. The <lb/> first impulse was to
                        fly from the scene; but I could not be <lb/> long insensible to the
                        exigences of the moment. I saw <lb/> that affairs must not be suffered to
                        remain in their present <lb/> situation. The insensibility or despair of
                        Welbeck required <lb/> consolation and succor. How to communicate my
                        thoughts, <lb/> or offer my assistance, I knew not. What led to this <reg
                            orig="mur-|derous">murderous</reg>
                        <lb/> catastrophe; who it was whose breathless corpse <lb/> was before me;
                        what concern Welbeck had in producing <lb/> his death; were as yet
                        unknown.</p>
                    <p>At length he rose from his seat, and strode at first with <lb/> faltering,
                        and then with more steadfast steps, across the <lb/> floor. This motion
                        seemed to put him in possession of <reg orig="him-|self">himself</reg>.
                        <lb/> He seemed now, for the first time, to recognise my <lb/> presence. He
                        turned to me and said in a tone of severity;</p>
                    <p>"How now! What brings you here?"</p>
                    <p>This rebuke was unexpected. I stammered out in reply, <lb/> that the report
                        of the pistol had alarmed me, and that I <lb/> came to discover the cause of
                        it.</p>
                    <p>He noticed not my answer, but resumed his perturbed <lb/> steps, and his
                        anxious, but abstracted looks. Suddenly he <lb/>
                        <pb n="77" entity="eaf033v2_0090" pid="uva-lib:349397">

                        </pb> checked himself, and glancing a furious eye at the corse, he <lb/>
                        muttered, "Yes, the die is cast. This worthless and <reg orig="mise-|rable"
                            >miserable</reg>
                        <lb/> scene shall last no longer. I will at once get rid of <lb/> life and
                        all its humiliations."</p>
                    <p>Here succeeded a new pause. The course of his thoughts <lb/> seemed now to
                        become once more tranquil. Sadness, rather <lb/> than fury, overspread his
                        features; and his accent, when he <lb/> spoke to me, was not faltering, but
                        solemn.</p>
                    <p>"Mervyn," said he, "you comprehend not this scene. <lb/> Your youth and
                        inexperience make you a stranger to a <reg orig="de-|ceitful"
                            >deceitful</reg>
                        <lb/> and flagitious world. You know me not. It is time <lb/> that this
                        ignorance should vanish. The knowledge of me <lb/> and of my actions may be
                        of use to you. It may teach you <lb/> to avoid the shoals on which my virtue
                        and my peace have <lb/> been wrecked; but to the rest of mankind it can be
                        of no <lb/> use. The ruin of my fame is, perhaps, irretrievable; but <lb/>
                        the height of my iniquity need not be known. I perceive <lb/> in you a
                        rectitude and firmness worthy to be trusted; promise <lb/> me, therefore,
                        that not a syllable of what I tell you shall ever <lb/> pass your lips."</p>
                    <p>I had lately experienced the inconvenience of a promise; <lb/> but I was now
                        confused, embarrassed, ardently inquisitive <lb/> as to the nature of this
                        scene, and unapprized of the motives <lb/> that might afterwards occur,
                        persuading or compelling me <lb/> to disclosure. The promise which he
                        exacted was given. <lb/> He resumed:</p>
                    <p>"I have detained you in my service, partly for your own <lb/> benefit, but
                        chiefly for mine. I intended to inflict upon you <lb/> injury and to do you
                        good. Neither of these ends can I <lb/> now accomplish, unless the lessons
                        which my example may <lb/> inculcate shall inspire you with fortitude, and
                        arm you with <lb/> caution.</p>
                    <p>"What it was that made me thus, I know not. I am <lb/> not destitute of
                        understanding. My thirst of knowledge, <lb/> though irregular, is ardent. I
                        can talk and can feel as <reg orig="vir-|tue">virtue</reg>
                        <lb/> and justice prescribe; yet the tenor of my actions has <lb/> been
                        uniform. One tissue of iniquity and folly has been my <lb/> life; while my
                        thoughts have been familiar with enlightened <lb/> and disinterested
                        principles. Scorn and detestation I have <lb/> heaped upon myself. Yesterday
                        is remembered with <reg orig="re-|morse">remorse</reg>. <lb/>
                        <pb n="78" entity="eaf033v2_0091" pid="uva-lib:349398"/> Tomorrow is
                        contemplated with anguish and fear; <lb/> yet every day is productive of the
                        same crimes and of the <lb/> same follies.</p>
                    <p>"I was left, by the insolvency of my father (a trader of <lb/> Liverpool,)
                        without any means of support, but such as labor <lb/> should afford me.
                        Whatever could generate pride, and <lb/> the love of independence, was my
                        portion. Whatever can <lb/> incite to diligence was the growth of my
                        condition; yet my <lb/> indolence was a cureless disease; and there were no
                        arts too <lb/> sordid for me to practise.</p>
                    <p>"I was content to live on the bounty of a kinsman. His <lb/> family was
                        numerous, and his revenue small. He forebore <lb/> to upbraid me, or even to
                        insinuate the propriety of <reg orig="provid-|ing">providing</reg>
                        <lb/> for myself; but he empowered me to pursue any liberal <lb/> or
                        mechanical profession which might suit my taste. I was <lb/> insensible to
                        every generous motive. I labored to forget <lb/> my dependent and
                        disgraceful condition, because the <reg orig="remem-|brance"
                            >remembrance</reg>
                        <lb/> was a source of anguish, without being able to inspire <lb/> me with a
                        steady resolution to change it.</p>
                    <p>"I contracted an acquaintance with a woman who was <lb/> unchaste, perverse
                        and malignant. Me, however, she found <lb/> it no difficult task to deceive.
                        My uncle remonstrated against <lb/> the union. He took infinite pains to
                        unveil my error, and <lb/> to convince me that wedlock was improper for one
                        destitute, <lb/> as I was, of the means of support, even if the object of my
                        <lb/> choice were personally unexceptionable.</p>
                    <p>"His representations were listened to with anger. That <lb/> he thwarted my
                        will, in this respect, even by affectionate <lb/> expostulation, cancelled
                        all that debt of gratitude which I <lb/> owed to him. I rewarded him for all
                        his kindness by <reg orig="invec-|tive">invective</reg>
                        <lb/> and disdain, and hastened to complete my ill-omened <lb/> marriage. I
                        had deceived the woman's father by assertions <lb/> of possessing secret
                        resources. To gratify my passion I <lb/> descended to dissimulation and
                        falsehood. He admitted me <lb/> into his family, as the husband of his
                        child; but the <reg orig="charac-|ter">character</reg>
                        <lb/> of my wife and the fallacy of my assertions were quickly <lb/>
                        discovered. He denied me accommodation under his roof, <lb/> and I was
                        turned forth to the world to endure the penalty of <lb/> my rashness and my
                        indolence.</p>
                    <p>"Temptation would have moulded me into any villanous <lb/> shape. My virtuous
                        theories and comprehensive erudition <lb/>
                        <pb n="79" entity="eaf033v2_0092" pid="uva-lib:349399"/> would not have
                        saved me from the basest of crimes. Luckily <lb/> for me, I was, for the
                        present, exempted from temptation. <lb/> I had formed an acquaintance with a
                        young American <reg orig="cap-|tain">captain</reg>. <lb/> On being partially
                        informed of my situation, he <reg orig="in-|vited">invited</reg>
                        <lb/> me to embark with him for his own country. My <lb/> passage was
                        gratuitous. I arrived, in a short time, at <lb/> Charleston, which was the
                        place of his abode.</p>
                    <p>"He introduced me to his family, every member of which <lb/> was, like
                        himself, imbued with affection and benevolence. <lb/> I was treated like
                        their son and brother. I was hospitably <lb/> entertained until I should be
                        able to select some path of <lb/> lucrative industry. Such was my incurable
                        depravity, that <lb/> I made no haste to select my pursuit. An interval of
                            <reg orig="inoc-|cupation">inoccupation</reg>
                        <lb/> succeeded, which I applied to the worst purposes.</p>
                    <p>"My friend had a sister, who was married; but, during <lb/> the absence of
                        her husband resided with her family. Hence <lb/> originated our
                        acquaintance. The purest of human hearts <lb/> and the most vigorous
                        understanding were hers. She idolized <lb/> her husband, who well deserved
                        to be the object of her <reg orig="ado-|ration">adoration</reg>. <lb/> Her
                        affection for him, and her general principles, <lb/> appeared to be
                        confirmed beyond the power to be shaken. <lb/> I sought her intercourse
                        without illicit views; I delighted in <lb/> the effusions of her candor and
                        the flashes of her <reg orig="intelli-|gence">intelligence</reg>; <lb/> I
                        conformed, by a kind of instinctive hypocrisy, to <lb/> her views; I spoke
                        and felt from the influence of immediate <lb/> and momentary conviction. She
                        imagined she had found <lb/> in me a friend worthy to partake in all her
                        sympathies, and <lb/> forward all her wishes. We were mutually deceived. She
                        <lb/> was the victim of self delusion; but I must charge myself <lb/> with
                        practising deceit both upon myself and her.</p>
                    <p>"I reflect with astonishment and horror on the steps <lb/> which led to her
                        degradation and to my calamity. In the <lb/> high career of passion all
                        consequences were overlooked. <lb/> She was the dupe of the most audacious
                        sophistry and the <lb/> grossest delusion. I was the slave of sensual
                        impulses and <lb/> voluntary blindness. The effect may be easily conceived.
                        <lb/> Not till symptoms of pregnancy began to appear were our <lb/> eyes
                        opened to the ruin which impended over us.</p>
                    <p>"Then I began to revolve the consequences, which the <lb/> mist of passion
                        had hitherto concealed. I was tormented <lb/> by the pangs of remorse, and
                        pursued by the phantom of <lb/>
                        <pb n="80" entity="eaf033v2_0093" pid="uva-lib:349400"/> ingratitude. To
                        complete my despair, this unfortunate lady <lb/> was apprized of my marriage
                        with another woman; a <reg orig="cir-|cumstance">circumstance</reg>
                        <lb/> which I had anxiously concealed from her. She <lb/> fled from her
                        father's house at a time when her husband <lb/> and brother were hourly
                        expected. What became of her <lb/> I knew not. She left behind her a letter
                        to her father, in <lb/> which the melancholy truth was told.</p>
                    <p>"Shame and remorse had no power over my life. To <lb/> elude the storm of
                        invective and upbraiding; to quiet the <lb/> uproar of my mind, I did not
                        betake myself to voluntary <lb/> death. My pusillanimity still clung to this
                        wretched <reg orig="exis-|tence">existence</reg>. <lb/> I abruptly retired
                        from the scene, and, repairing to <lb/> the port, embarked in the first
                        vessel which appeared. The <lb/> ship chanced to belong to Wilmington, in
                        Delaware, and <lb/> here I sought out an obscure and cheap abode.</p>
                    <p>"I possessed no means of subsistence. I was unknown <lb/> to my neighbors,
                        and desired to remain unknown. I was <lb/> unqualified for manual labor by
                        all the habits of my life; <lb/> but there was no choice between penury and

                        <lb/> honest labor and criminal inactivity. I mused <reg

                        <lb/> on the forlornness of my condition. Hour after hour <lb/> passed, and
                        the horrors of want began to encompass me. <lb/> I sought with eagerness for

                        <lb/> from it. The perverseness of my nature led me on <lb/> from one guilty
                        thought to another. I took refuge in my <lb/> customary sophistries, and
                        reconciled myself at length to a <lb/> scheme of&mdash;<hi rend="italic"

                    <p>"I quickly discovered that to execute this scheme <reg orig="de-|manded"

                        <lb/> time, application and money, none of which my <lb/> present situation

                        country occupations. My pride <lb/> regarded as vile and ignominious
                        drudgery any employment <lb/> which the town could afford. Meanwhile, my
                        wants were <lb/> as urgent as ever, and my funds were exhausted.</p>
                    <p>"There are few, perhaps, whose external situation <reg orig="resem-|bled"
                            >resembled</reg>
                        <lb/> mine, who would have found in it any thing but <reg
                            orig="in-|citements">incitements</reg>
                        <lb/> to industry and invention. A thousand methods <lb/> of subsistence,
                        honest but laborious, were at my <reg orig="com-|mand">command</reg>, <lb/>
                        but to these I entertained an irreconcilable <reg orig="aver-|sion"
                            >aversion</reg>. <lb/> Ease and the respect attendant upon opulence I
                        was <lb/> willing to purchase at the price of ever-wakeful suspicion <lb/>
                        and eternal remorse; but, even at this price, the purchase <lb/> was
                        impossible.</p>
                    <p>"The desperateness of my condition became hourly more <lb/> apparent. The
                        further I extended my view, the darker <lb/> grew the clouds which hung over
                        futurity. Anguish and <lb/> infamy appeared to be the inseparable conditions
                        of my <reg orig="ex-|istence">existence</reg>. <lb/> There was one mode of
                        evading the evils that <reg orig="im-|pended">impended</reg>. <lb/> To free
                        myself from self-upbraiding and to shun <lb/> the persecutions of my fortune
                        was possible only by shaking <lb/> off life itself.</p>
                    <p>"One evening, as I traversed the bank of the creek, these <lb/> dismal
                        meditations were uncommonly intense. They at <lb/> length terminated in a
                        resolution to throw myself into the <lb/> stream. The first impulse was to
                        rush instantly to my <lb/> death, but the remembrance of papers, lying at my
                        lodgings, <lb/>
                        <pb n="82" entity="eaf033v2_0095" pid="uva-lib:349402"/> which might unfold
                        more than I desired to the curiosity of <lb/> survivors, induced me to
                        postpone this catastrophe till the <lb/> next morning.</p>
                    <p>"My purpose being formed, I found my heart lightened of <lb/> its usual
                        weight. By you it will be thought strange, but it <lb/> is nevertheless
                        true, that I derived from this new prospect, <lb/> not only tranquillity but
                        cheerfulness. I hastened home. <lb/> As soon as I entered, my landlord
                        informed me that a <reg orig="per-|son">person</reg>
                        <lb/> had been searching for me in my absence. This was <lb/> an unexampled
                        incident and foreboded me no good. I was <lb/> strongly persuaded that my
                        visitant had been led hither not <lb/> by friendly, but hostile purposes.
                        This persuasion was <reg orig="con-|firmed">confirmed</reg>
                        <lb/> by the description of the stranger's guise and <reg orig="de-|meanor"
                            >demeanor</reg>
                        <lb/> given by my landlord. My fears instantly <reg orig="recog-|nised"
                            >recognised</reg>
                        <lb/> the image of Watson, the man by whom I had been <lb/> so eminently
                        benefited, and whose kindness I had <reg orig="compen-|sated"
                            >compensated</reg>
                        <lb/> by the ruin of his sister and the confusion of his <lb/> family.</p>
                    <p>"An interview with this man was less to be endured than <lb/> to look upon
                        the face of an avenging deity. I was <reg orig="deter-|mined"
                            >determined</reg>
                        <lb/> to avoid this interview, and for this end, to execute <lb/> my fatal
                        purpose within the hour. My papers were <reg orig="collect-|ed"
                            >collected</reg>
                        <lb/> with a tremulous hand, and consigned to the flames. I <lb/> then bade
                        my landlord inform all visitants that I should not <lb/> return till the
                        next day, and once more hastened towards <lb/> the river.</p>
                    <p>"My way led past the inn where one of the stages from <lb/> Baltimore was
                        accustomed to stop. I was not unaware that <lb/> Watson had possibly been
                        brought in the coach which had <lb/> recently arrived, and which now stood
                        before the door of <lb/> the inn. The danger of my being descried or
                        encountered <lb/> by him as I passed did not fail to occur. This was to be
                        <lb/> eluded by deviating from the main street.</p>
                    <p>"Scarcely had I turned a corner for this purpose when I <lb/> was accosted by
                        a young man whom I knew to be an <reg orig="in-|habitant">inhabitant</reg>
                        <lb/> of the town, but with whom I had hitherto had no <lb/> intercourse but
                        what consisted in a transient salutation. He <lb/> apologized for the
                        liberty of addressing me, and, at the same <lb/> time, inquired if I
                        understood the French language.</p>
                    <p>"Being answered in the affirmative, he proceeded to tell <lb/> me, that in
                        the stage, just arrived, had come a passenger, a <lb/>
                        <pb n="83" entity="eaf033v2_0096" pid="uva-lib:349403"/> youth who appeared
                        to be French, who was wholly <reg orig="unac-|quainted">unacquainted</reg>
                        <lb/> with our language, and who had been seized with <lb/> a violent
                        disease.</p>
                    <p>"My informant had felt compassion for the forlorn <reg orig="condi-|tion"
                            >condition</reg>
                        <lb/> of the stranger, and had just been seeking me at my <lb/> lodgings, in
                        hope that my knowledge of French would <reg orig="ena-|ble">enable</reg>
                        <lb/> me to converse with the sick man, and obtain from him <lb/> a
                        knowledge of his situation and views.</p>
                    <p>"The apprehensions I had precipitately formed, were thus <lb/> removed and I
                        readily consented to perform this service. <lb/> The youth was, indeed, in a
                        deplorable condition. Besides <lb/> the pains of his disease, he was
                        overpowered by dejection. <lb/> The innkeeper was extremely anxious for the
                        removal of <lb/> his guest. He was by no means willing to sustain the
                        trouble <lb/> and expense of a sick or a dying man, for which it was, <lb/>
                        scarcely probable that he should ever be reimbursed. The <lb/> traveller had
                        no baggage, and his dress betokened the <reg orig="pres-|sure"
                            >pressure</reg>
                        <lb/> of many wants.</p>
                    <p>"My compassion for this stranger was powerfully <reg orig="awa-|kened"
                            >awakened</reg>. <lb/> I was in possession of a suitable apartment, for
                        <lb/> which I had no power to pay the rent that was accruing, but <lb/> my
                        inability in this respect was unknown, and I might <reg orig="en-|joy"
                            >enjoy</reg>
                        <lb/> my lodgings unmolested for some weeks. The fate of <lb/> this youth
                        would be speedily decided, and I should be left at <lb/> liberty to execute
                        my first intentions before my <reg orig="embarrass-|ments"
                            >embarrassments</reg>
                        <lb/> should be visibly increased.</p>
                    <p>"After a moment's pause, I conducted the stranger to my <lb/> home, placed
                        him in my own bed, and became his nurse. <lb/> His malady was such as is
                        known in the tropical islands, by <lb/> the name of the yellow or malignant
                        fever, and the <reg orig="physi-|cian">physician</reg>
                        <lb/> who was called, speedily pronounced his case <reg orig="despe-|rate"
                            >desperate</reg>.</p>
                    <p>"It was my duty to warn him of the death that was <reg orig="hasten-|ing"
                            >hastening</reg>, <lb/> and to promise the fulfilment of any of his
                        wishes, not <lb/> inconsistent with my present situation. He received my
                            <reg orig="in-|telligence">intelligence</reg>
                        <lb/> with fortitude, and appeared anxious to <reg orig="commu-|nicate"
                            >communicate</reg>
                        <lb/> some information respecting his own state. His <lb/> pangs and his
                        weakness scarcely allowed him to be <reg orig="intelli-|gible"
                            >intelligible</reg>. <lb/> From his feeble efforts and broken narrative
                        I <reg orig="col-|lected">collected</reg>
                        <lb/> thus much concerning his family and fortune.</p>
                    <p>"His father's name was Vincentio Lodi. From a <reg orig="mer-|chant"
                            >merchant</reg>
                        <lb/>
                        <pb n="84" entity="eaf033v2_0097" pid="uva-lib:349404"/> at Leghorn, he had
                        changed himself into a planter in <lb/> the island of Guadaloupe. His son,
                        had been sent, at an <lb/> early age, for the benefits of education to
                        Europe. The <lb/> young Vincentio was, at length, informed by his father,
                        that, <lb/> being weary of his present mode of existence, he had <reg
                            orig="deter-|mined">determined</reg>
                        <lb/> to sell his property, and transport himself to the <reg
                            orig="Uni-|ted">United</reg>
                        <lb/> States. The son was directed to hasten home, that he <lb/> might
                        embark, with his father, on this voyage.</p>
                    <p>"The summons was cheerfully obeyed. The youth on his <lb/> arrival at the
                        island found preparation making for the <reg orig="fune-|ral">funeral</reg>
                        <lb/> of his father. It appeared that the elder Lodi had <reg
                            orig="flat-|tered">flattered</reg>
                        <lb/> one of his slaves with the prospect of his freedom, but <lb/> had,
                        nevertheless, included this slave in the sale that he had <lb/> made of his
                        estate. Actuated by revenge, the slave <reg orig="assassi-|nated"
                            >assassinated</reg>
                        <lb/> Lodi in the open street and resigned himself, without <lb/> a
                        struggle, to the punishment which the law had provided <lb/> for such a
                        deed.</p>
                    <p>"The property had been recently transferred, and the <lb/> price was now
                        presented to young Vincentio by the <reg orig="pur-|chaser">purchaser</reg>.
                        <lb/> He was, by no means, inclined to adopt his father's <lb/> project, and
                        was impatient, to return with his inheritance, to <lb/> France. Before this
                        could be done, the conduct of his <reg orig="fa-|ther">father</reg>
                        <lb/> had rendered a voyage to the continent indispensable.</p>
                    <p>"Lodi had a daughter, whom, a few weeks previous to his <lb/> death, he had
                        entrusted to an American captain, for whom <lb/> he had contracted a
                        friendship. The vessel was bound to <lb/> Philadelphia, but the conduct she
                        was to pursue, and the <lb/> abode she was to select, on her arrival, were
                        known only to <lb/> the father, whose untimely death involved the son in
                            <reg orig="con-|siderable">considerable</reg>
                        <lb/> uncertainty with regard to his sister's fate. His <lb/> anxiety on
                        this account induced him to seize the first <reg orig="con-|veyance"
                            >conveyance</reg>
                        <lb/> that offered. In a short time he landed at <reg orig="Balti-|more"
                            >Baltimore</reg>.</p>
                    <p>"As soon as he recovered from the fatigues of his voyage, <lb/> he prepared
                        to go to Philadelphia. Thither his baggage <lb/> was immediately sent under
                        the protection of a passenger <lb/> and countryman. His money consisted in
                        Portuguese gold, <lb/> which, in pursuance of advice, he had changed into
                        bank <lb/> notes. He besought me, in pathetic terms, to search out <lb/> his
                        sister, whose youth, and poverty, and ignorance of the <lb/> language and
                        manners of the country might expose her to <lb/>

                        </pb> innumerable hardships. At the same time, he put a pocket <lb/> book
                        and small volume into my hand, indicating, by his <lb/> countenance and
                        gestures, his desire that I would deliver <lb/> them to his sister.</p>
                    <p>"His obsequies being decently performed, I had leisure to <lb/> reflect upon
                        the change in my condition which this incident <lb/> had produced. In the
                        pocket-book were found bills to the <lb/> amount of twenty thousand dollars.
                        The volume proved to <lb/> be a manuscript, written by the elder Lodi in
                        Italian, and <lb/> contained memoirs of the Ducal house of Visconti, from
                        <lb/> whom the writer believed himself to have lineally descended.</p>
                    <p>"Thus had I arrived, by an avenue so much beyond my <lb/> foresight, at the
                        possession of wealth. The evil which <reg orig="im-|pelled">impelled</reg>
                        <lb/> me to the brink of suicide, and which was the source, <lb/> though not
                        of all, yet of the larger portion of my anguish, <lb/> was now removed. What
                        claims to honor or to ease were <lb/> consequent on riches, were, by an
                        extraordinary fortune, <lb/> now conferred upon me.</p>
                    <p>"Such, for a time, were my new born but transitory <reg orig="rap-|tures"
                            >raptures</reg>. <lb/> I forgot that this money was not mine. That it
                        had <lb/> been received under every sanction of fidelity, for another's
                        <lb/> use. To retain it was equivalent to robbery. The sister <lb/> of the
                        deceased was the rightful claimant; it was my duty to <lb/> search her out,
                        and perform my tacit, but sacred obligations, <lb/> by putting the whole
                        into her possession.</p>
                    <p>"This conclusion was too adverse to my wishes, not to be <lb/> strenuously
                        combated. I asked, what it was that gave man <lb/> the power of ascertaining
                        the successor to his property? <lb/> During his life, he might transfer the

                        the law <lb/> had sometimes otherwise decreed, but in law, there was no
                        <lb/> validity, further than it was able by investigation and <reg

                        imparted. It was the topic of remote inferences <lb/> and vague conjecture
                        rather than of explicit and unerring <lb/> declarations. Besides, if the
                        lady were found, would not <lb/> prudence dictate the reservation of her

                        <lb/> and protector. By supplying all her wants and <lb/> watching over her

                        to do this, I shall lay irresistible <lb/> claims to her love and her

                        the baggage of the deceased <lb/> to an inn, and gained possession of it. It
                        contained nothing <lb/> but clothes and books. I then instituted the most
                        diligent <lb/> search after the young lady. For a time, my exertions were
                        <lb/> fruitless.</p>

                        Some scheme to rescue me from this fate, was <lb/> indispensable; but my

                    <p>"I was plunged anew into dejection and perplexity. From <lb/>

                        proposed seemed <lb/> liable to no possibility of miscarriage. A ship was to

                        the voyage be safely performed, <lb/> the profits would be double the
                        original expense. Should <lb/> the ship be taken or wrecked, the insurers

                    <p>"All my money was laid out upon this scheme. Scarcely <lb/> enough was
                        reserved to supply domestic and personal wants. <lb/> Large debts were
                        likewise incurred. Our caution had, as <lb/> we conceived, annihilated every

                        infallible; and <lb/> the vessel, amply fitted and freighted, departed on
                        her <lb/> voyage.</p>
                    <p>"An interval, not devoid of suspense and anxiety, <reg orig="suc-|ceeded"

                        wedlock, would have <lb/> been regarded with delight. As it was, no symptoms
                        were <lb/> equally to be deplored. Consequences, as long as they <lb/> were
                        involved in uncertainty, were extenuated or <reg orig="over-|looked"
                            >overlooked</reg>; <lb/> but now, when they became apparent and <reg

                        upbraiding.</p>
                    <p>"Indefinable fears, and a desire to monopolize all the <lb/> meditations and
                        affections of this being, had induced me <lb/> to perpetuate her ignorance
                        of any but her native language, <lb/> and debar her from all intercourse
                        with the world. My <lb/> friends were of course inquisitive respecting her
                        character, <lb/> adventures, and particularly her relation to me. The <reg

                        <lb/> how much the truth redounded to my dishonor, <lb/> made me solicitous
                        to lead conjecture astray. For this <reg orig="pur-|pose">purpose</reg>
                        <lb/> I did not discountenance the conclusion that was <lb/> adopted by
                        some, that she was my daughter. I reflected, <lb/> that all dangerous
                        surmises would be effectually precluded <lb/> by this belief.</p>
                    <p>"These precautions afforded me some consolation in my <lb/> present
                        difficulties. It was requisite to conceal the lady's <lb/> condition from
                        the world. If this should be ineffectual, it <lb/> would not be difficult to
                        divert suspicion from my person. <lb/> The secrecy that I had practised
                        would be justified, in the <lb/> apprehension of those to whom the personal
                        condition of <lb/> Clemenza should be disclosed, by the feelings of a
                        father.</p>
                    <p>"Meanwhile, it was an obvious expedient to remove the <lb/> unhappy lady to a
                        distance from impertinent observers. A <lb/> rural retreat, lonely and
                        sequestered, was easily procured, <lb/> and hither she consented to repair.
                        This arrangement <lb/> being concerted, I had leisure to reflect upon the
                        evils <lb/> which every hour brought nearer, and which threatened to <lb/>
                        exterminate me.</p>

                        <lb/> to rise before day, and seek some respite in the <lb/> fields.
                        Returning from one of these unseasonable rambles, <lb/> I chanced to meet

                        visage, is remarkable. When <lb/> you first met my eye, this similitude
                        startled me. Your <lb/> subsequent appeal to my compassion was clothed in
                        such <lb/> terms, as formed a powerful contrast with your dress, and <lb/>
                        prepossessed me greatly in favor of your education and <lb/> capacity.</p>
                    <p>"In my present hopeless condition, every incident, <reg orig="how-|ever"

                        it some means of escaping from my difficulties. <lb/> My love for the
                        Italian girl, in spite of all my efforts to keep <lb/> it alive, had begun
                        to languish. Marriage was impossible; <lb/> and had now, in some degree,
                        ceased to be desirable. We <lb/> are apt to judge of others by ourselves.
                        The passion, I <lb/> now found myself disposed to ascribe chiefly to
                        fortuitous <lb/> circumstances; to the impulse of gratitude, and the <reg
                            orig="exclu-|sion">exclusion</reg>
                        <lb/> of competitors; and believed that your resemblance to <lb/> her
                        brother, your age, and personal accomplishments, might, <lb/> after a
                        certain time, and in consequence of suitable <reg orig="contri-|vances"
                            >contrivances</reg>, <lb/> on my part, give a new direction to her
                        feelings. <lb/> To gain your concurrence, I relied upon your simplicity,
                        <lb/> your gratitude, and your susceptibility to the charms of this <lb/>
                        bewitching creature.</p>
                    <p>"I contemplated, likewise, another end. Mrs. Wentworth <lb/> is rich. A youth
                        who was once her favorite, and designed <lb/> to inherit her fortunes, has
                        disappeared, for some years, <lb/> from the scene. His death is most
                        probable, but of that <lb/> there is no satisfactory information. The life
                        of this <reg orig="per-|son">person</reg>, <lb/> whose name is Clavering, is
                        an obstacle to some designs <lb/> which had occurred to me in relation to
                        this woman. My <lb/> purposes were crude and scarcely formed. I need not
                        <lb/> swell the catalogue of my errors by expatiating upon them. <lb/>
                        Suffice it to say, that the peculiar circumstances of your <lb/>
                        introduction to me, led me to reflections on the use that <lb/> might be
                        made of your agency, in procuring this lady's <lb/> acquiescence in my
                        schemes. You were to be ultimately <lb/> persuaded to confirm her in the
                        belief that her nephew was <lb/> dead. To this consummation it was
                        indispensable to lead <lb/> you by slow degrees, and circuitous paths.
                        Meanwhile, a <lb/> profound silence, with regard to your genuine history,
                        was to <lb/> be observed; and to this forbearance, your consent was <lb/>
                        obtained with more readiness than I expected.</p>
                    <pb n="91" entity="eaf033v2_0104" pid="uva-lib:349411"/>
                    <p>"There was an additional motive for the treatment you <lb/> received from me.
                        My personal projects and cares had <lb/> hitherto prevented me from reading
                        Lodi's manuscript; a <lb/> slight inspection, however, was sufficient to
                        prove that the <lb/> work was profound and eloquent. My ambition has panted,
                        <lb/> with equal avidity, after the reputation of literature and <lb/>
                        opulence. To claim the authorship of this work was too <lb/> harmless and
                        specious a stratagem, not to be readily <reg orig="sug-|gested"
                            >suggested</reg>. <lb/> I meant to translate it into English, and to
                        enlarge <lb/> it by enterprising incidents of my own invention. My <reg
                            orig="scru-|ples">scruples</reg>
                        <lb/> to assume the merit of the original composer, might <lb/> thus be
                        removed. For this end, your assistance as an <lb/> amanuensis would be
                        necessary.</p>
                    <p>"You will perceive, that all these projects depended on the <lb/> seasonable
                        arrival of intelligence from &mdash;. The delay <lb/> of another week would
                        seal my destruction. The silence <lb/> might arise from the foundering of
                        the ship, and the <reg orig="de-|struction">destruction</reg>
                        <lb/> of all on board. In this case, the insurance was <lb/> not forfeited,
                        but payment could not be obtained within a <lb/> year. Meanwhile, the
                        premium and other debts must be <lb/> immediately discharged, and this was
                        beyond my power. <lb/> Meanwhile I was to live in a manner that would not
                        belie <lb/> my pretensions; but my coffers were empty.</p>
                    <p>"I cannot adequately paint the anxieties with which I <lb/> have been
                        haunted. Each hour has added to the burden <lb/> of my existence, till, in
                        consequence of the events of this <lb/> day, it has become altogether
                        insupportable. Some hours <lb/> ago, I was summoned by Thetford to his
                        house. The <lb/> messenger informed me that tidings had been received of
                        <lb/> my ship. In answer to my eager interrogations, he could <lb/> give no
                        other information than that she had been captured <lb/> by the British. He
                        was unable to relate particulars.</p>
                    <p>"News of her safe return would, indeed, have been far <lb/> more acceptable;
                        but even this information was a source of <lb/> infinite congratulation. It
                        precluded the demand of my <lb/> insurers. The payment of other debts might
                        be postponed <lb/> for a month, and my situation be the same as before the
                        <lb/> adoption of this successless scheme. Hope and joy were <lb/>
                        reinstated in my bosom, and I hasted to Thetford's compting <lb/> house.</p>
                    <pb n="92" entity="eaf033v2_0105" pid="uva-lib:349412"/>
                    <p>"He received me with an air of gloomy dissatisfaction. <lb/> I accounted for
                        his sadness by supposing him averse to <lb/> communicate information, which
                        was less favorable than <lb/> our wishes had dictated. He confirmed, with
                        visible <reg orig="re-|luctance">reluctance</reg>, <lb/> the news of her
                        capture. He had just received <lb/> letters from his brother, acquainting
                        him with all <reg orig="particu-|lars">particulars</reg>, <lb/> and
                        containing the official documents of this <reg orig="tran-|saction"
                            >transaction</reg>.</p>
                    <p>"This had no tendency to damp my satisfaction, and I <lb/> proceeded to
                        peruse with eagerness, the papers which he <lb/> put into my hand. I had not
                        proceeded far, when my <lb/> joyous hopes vanished. Two French mulattoes
                        had, after <lb/> much solicitation, and the most solemn promises to carry
                        <lb/> with them no articles which the laws of war decree to be <lb/>
                        contraband, obtained a passage in the vessel. She was <lb/> speedily
                        encountered by a privateer, by whom every <reg orig="recep-|tacle"
                            >receptacle</reg>
                        <lb/> was ransacked. In a chest, belonging to the <reg orig="French-|men"
                            >Frenchmen</reg>, <lb/> and which they had affirmed to contain nothing
                        but <lb/> their clothes, were found two sabres, and other <reg
                            orig="accoutre-|ments">accoutrements</reg>
                        <lb/> of an officer of cavalry. Under this pretence, the <lb/> vessel was
                        captured and condemned, and this was a cause <lb/> of forfeiture, which had
                        not been provided against in the <lb/> contract of insurance.</p>
                    <p>"By this untoward event, my hopes were irreparably <lb/> blasted. The utmost
                        efforts were demanded to conceal my <lb/> thoughts from my companion. The
                        anguish that preyed <lb/> upon my heart was endeavored to be masked by looks
                        <lb/> of indifference. I pretended to have been previously <reg
                            orig="in-|formed">informed</reg>
                        <lb/> by the messenger, not only of the capture, but of <lb/> the cause that
                        led to it, and forbore to expatiate upon <lb/> my loss, or to execrate the
                        authors of my disappointment. <lb/> My mind, however, was the theatre of
                        discord and agony, <lb/> and I waited with impatience for an opportunity to
                        leave <lb/> him.</p>
                    <p>"For want of other topics, I asked by whom this <reg orig="informa-|tion"
                            >information</reg>
                        <lb/> had been brought. He answered, that the bearer was <lb/> Captain Amos
                        Watson, whose vessel had been forfeited, at <lb/> the same time, under a
                        different pretence. He added, that <lb/> my name being mentioned,
                        accidentally, to Watson, the <lb/> latter had betrayed marks of great
                        surprise, and been very <lb/> earnest in his inquiries respecting my
                        situation. Having <lb/>
                        <pb n="93" entity="eaf033v2_0106" pid="uva-lib:349413"/> obtained what
                        knowledge Thetford was able to <reg orig="communi-|cate">communicate</reg>,
                        <lb/> the captain had departed, avowing a former <reg orig="acquaint-|ance"
                            >acquaintance</reg>
                        <lb/> with me, and declaring his intention of paying me a <lb/> visit.</p>
                    <p>"These words operated on my frame like lightning. All <lb/> within me was
                        tumult and terror, and I rushed precipitately <lb/> out of the house. I went
                        forward with unequal steps, and <lb/> at random. Some instinct led me into
                        the fields, and I was <lb/> not apprized of the direction of my steps, till,
                        looking up, I <lb/> found myself upon the shore of Schuylkill.</p>
                    <p>"Thus was I, a second time, overborne by hopeless and <lb/> incurable evils.
                        An interval of motley feelings, of specious <lb/> artifice, and contemptible
                        imposture, had elapsed since my <lb/> meeting with the stranger at
                        Wilmington. Then my forlorn <lb/> state had led me to the brink of suicide.
                        A brief and <lb/> feverish respite had been afforded me, but now was I <reg
                            orig="trans-|ported">transported</reg>
                        <lb/> to the verge of the same abyss.</p>
                    <p>"Amos Watson was the brother of the angel whom I had <lb/> degraded and
                        destroyed. What but fiery indignation and <lb/> unappeasable vengeance,
                        could lead him into my presence? <lb/> With what heart could I listen to his
                        invectives? How <lb/> could I endure to look upon the face of one, whom I
                        had <lb/> loaded with such atrocious and intolerable injuries?</p>
                    <p>"I was acquainted with his loftiness of mind; his <reg orig="detesta-|tion"
                            >detestation</reg>
                        <lb/> of injustice, and the whirlwind passions that ingratitude <lb/> and
                        villany like mine were qualified to awaken in his bosom. <lb/> I dreaded not
                        his violence. The death that he might be <lb/> prompted to inflict, was no
                        object of aversion. It was <reg orig="pov-|erty">poverty</reg>
                        <lb/> and disgrace, the detection of my crimes, the looks and <lb/> voice of
                        malediction and upbraiding, from which my <reg orig="cow-|ardice"
                            >cowardice</reg>
                        <lb/> shrunk.</p>
                    <p>"Why should I live? I must vanish from that stage which <lb/> I had lately
                        trodden. My flight must be instant and <reg orig="pre-|cipitate"
                            >precipitate</reg>. <lb/> To be a fugitive from exasperated creditors,
                        and <lb/> from the industrious revenge of Watson, was an easy <reg

                        where I should not be <lb/> pursued by the phantoms of remorse, by the dread
                        of hourly <lb/> detection, by the necessities of hunger and thirst? In what
                        <lb/> scene should I be exempt from servitude and drudgery? <lb/> Was my
                        existence embellished with enjoyments that would <lb/>
                        <pb n="94" entity="eaf033v2_0107" pid="uva-lib:349414"/> justify my holding

                        <lb/> in obscurity?</p>
                    <p>"There was no room for hesitation. To rush into the <lb/> stream before me,
                        and put an end at once to my life and the <lb/> miseries inseparably linked
                        with it, was the only proceeding <lb/> which fate had left to my choice. My
                        muscles wese <reg orig="al-|ready">already</reg>
                        <lb/> exerted for this end, when the helpless condition of <lb/> Clemenza
                        was remembered. What provision could I make <lb/> against the evils that
                        threatened her? Should I leave her <lb/> utterly forlorn and friendless?
                        Mrs. Wentworth's temper <lb/> was forgiving and compassionate. Adversity had
                        taught her <lb/> to participate, and her wealth enabled her to relieve
                        distress. <lb/> Who was there by whom such powerful claims to succour <lb/>
                        and protection could be urged as by this desolate girl? <lb/> Might I not
                        state her situation in a letter to this lady, and <lb/> urge irresistible
                        pleas for the extension of her kindness to <lb/> this object?</p>
                    <p>"These thoughts made me suspend my steps. I <reg orig="deter-|mined"
                            >determined</reg>
                        <lb/> to seek my habitation once more, and having written <lb/> and
                        deposited this letter, to return to the execution of my <lb/> fatal purpose.
                        I had scarcely reached my own door, when <lb/> some one approached along the
                        pavement. The form, at <lb/> first, was undistinguishable, but by coming, at
                        length, within <lb/> the illumination of a lamp, it was perfectly
                        recognised.</p>
                    <p>"To avoid this detested interview was now impossible. <lb/> Watson approached
                        and accosted me. In this conflict of <lb/> tumultuous feelings I was still
                        able to maintain an air of <reg orig="in-|trepidity">intrepidity</reg>.
                        <lb/> His demeanor was that of a man who struggles <lb/> with his rage. His
                        accents were hurried, and scarcely <reg orig="ar-|ticulate"
                        >articulate</reg>. <lb/> I have ten words to say to you, said he; lead into
                        <lb/> the house, and to some private room. My business with <lb/> you will
                        be despatched in a breath.</p>
                    <p>"I made him no answer, but led the way into my house, <lb/> and to my study.
                        On entering this room, I put the light <lb/> upon the table, and turning to
                        my visitant, prepared, silently <lb/> to hear, what he had to unfold. He
                        struck his clenched <lb/> hand against the table with violence. His motion
                        was of <lb/> that tempestuous kind, as to overwhelm the power of <reg

                        itself in gesticulations <lb/> than in words. At length, he exclaimed,</p>
                    <p>"It is well. Now has the hour, so long, and so impatiently <lb/>

                    <p>"My sister is dead; dead of anguish and a broken heart. <lb/> Remote from her

                    <p>"Her husband is no more. He returned after a long <lb/> absence, a tedious
                        navigation, and vicissitudes of hardships. <lb/> He flew to the bosom of his
                        love; of his wife. She was <lb/> gone; lost to him, and to virtue. In a fit
                        of desperation, <lb/> he retired to his chamber and despatched himself. This
                        is <lb/> the instrument with which the deed was performed.</p>
                    <p>"Saying this, Watson took a pistol from his pocket, and <lb/> held it to my
                        head. I lifted not my hand to turn aside the <lb/> weapon. I did not shudder
                        at the spectacle, or shrink from <lb/> his approaching hand. With fingers
                        clasped together, and <lb/> eyes fixed upon the floor, I waited till his
                        fury was <reg orig="ex-|hausted">exhausted</reg>. <lb/> He continued:</p>
                    <p>"All passed in a few hours. The elopement of his <reg
                            orig="daugh-|ter&mdash;the">daughter&mdash;the</reg>
                        <lb/> death of his son. O! my father! Most loved, <lb/> and most venerable
                        of men! To see thee changed into a <lb/> maniac! Haggard and wild! Deterred
                        from outrage on <lb/> thyself and those around thee, by fetters and stripes!
                        What <lb/> was it that saved me from a like fate? To view this hideous <lb/>
                        ruin, and to think by whom it was occasioned! Yet not to <lb/> become
                        frantic like thee, my father; or not destroy myself <lb/> like thee, my
                        brother! My friend!&mdash;</p>
                    <p>"No. For this hour was I reserved; to avenge your <lb/> wrongs and mine in
                        the blood of this ungrateful villain.</p>
                    <p>"There, continued he, producing a second pistol, and <lb/> tendering it to
                        me, there is thy defence. Take we <reg orig="oppo-|site">opposite</reg>
                        <lb/> sides of this table, and fire at the same instant.</p>
                    <p>"During this address I was motionless. He tendered the <lb/> pistol, but I
                        unclasped not my hands to receive it.</p>
                    <p>"Why do you hesitate? resumed he. Let the chance <lb/> between us be equal,
                        or fire you first.</p>
                    <p>"No, said I, I am ready to die by your hand. I wish it. <lb/> It will
                        preclude the necessity of performing the office for <lb/> myself. I have
                        injured you, and merit all that your <reg orig="ven-|geance">vengeance</reg>
                        <lb/> can inflict. I know your nature too well, to believe <lb/> that my
                        death will be perfect expiation. When the gust of <lb/>
                        <pb n="96" entity="eaf033v2_0109" pid="uva-lib:349416"/> indignation is
                        past, the remembrance of your deed will only <lb/> add to your sum of
                        misery; yet I do not love you well <lb/> enough to wish that you would
                        forbear. I desire to die, and <lb/> to die by another's hand rather than my
                        own.</p>
                    <p>"Coward! exclaimed Watson, with augmented vehemence, <lb/> You know me too
                        well, to believe me capable of <reg orig="assassina-|tion"
                            >assassination</reg>. <lb/> Vile subterfuge! Contemptible plea! Take the
                        pistol <lb/> and defend yourself. You want not the power or the will; <lb/>
                        but, knowing that I spurn at murder, you think your safety <lb/> will be
                        found in passiveness. Your refusal will avail you <lb/> little. Your fame,
                        if not your life, is at my mercy. If you <lb/> faulter now, I will allow you
                        to live, but only till I have <lb/> stabbed your reputation.</p>
                    <p>"I now fixed my eyes steadfastly upon him, and spoke; <lb/> How much a
                        stranger are you to the feelings of Welbeck! <lb/> How poor a judge of his
                        cowardice! I take your pistol, and <lb/> consent to your conditions.</p>
                    <p>"We took opposite sides of the table. Are you ready? <lb/> he cried,
                        fire!</p>
                    <p>"Both triggers were drawn at the same instant. Both <lb/> pistols were
                        discharged. Mine was negligently raised. <lb/> Such is the untoward chance
                        that presides over human <reg orig="af-|fairs">affairs</reg>; <lb/> such is
                        the malignant destiny by which my steps have <lb/> ever been pursued. The
                        bullet whistled harmlessly by me. <lb/> Levelled by an eye that never before
                        failed, and with so <lb/> small an interval between us. I escaped, but my
                        blind and <lb/> random shot took place in his heart.</p>
                    <p>"There is the fruit of this disastrous meeting. The <reg orig="cata-|logue"
                            >catalogue</reg>
                        <lb/> of death is thus completed. Thou sleepest Watson! <lb/> Thy sister is
                        at rest, and so art thou. Thy vows of <reg orig="ven-|geance"
                            >vengeance</reg>
                        <lb/> are at an end. It was not reserved for thee to be <lb/> thy own and
                        thy sister's avenger. Welbeck's measure of <lb/> transgressions is now full,
                        and his own hand must execute <lb/> the justice that is due to him."</p>

                    <p><hi rend="small-caps">Such</hi> was Welbeck's tale, listened to by me with an
                        <lb/> eagerness in which every faculty was absorbed. How <reg
                            orig="ad-|verse">adverse</reg>
                        <lb/> to my dreams were the incidents that had just been <lb/> related! The
                        curtain was lifted, and a scene of guilt and <lb/> ignominy disclosed, where
                        my rash and inexperienced youth <lb/> had suspected nothing but loftiness
                        and magnanimity.</p>
                    <p>For awhile the wondrousness of this tale kept me from <lb/> contemplating the
                        consequences that awaited us. My <reg orig="un-|fledged">unfledged</reg>
                        <lb/> fancy had not hitherto soared to this pitch. All <lb/> was astounding
                        by its novelty, or terrific by its horror. The <lb/> very scene of these
                        offences partook, to my rustic <reg orig="appre-|hension"
                        >apprehension</reg>, <lb/> of fairy splendor, and magical abruptness. My
                        <lb/> understanding was bemazed, and my senses were taught to <lb/> distrust
                        their own testimony.</p>
                    <p>From this musing state I was recalled by my companion, <lb/> who said to me
                        in solemn accents. Mervyn! I have but <lb/> two requests to make. Assist me
                        to bury these remains, <lb/> and then accompany me across the river. I have
                        no power <lb/> to compel your silence on the acts that you have witnessed.
                        <lb/> I have meditated to benefit, as well as to injure you; but I <lb/> do
                        not desire that your demeanor should conform to any <lb/> other standard
                        than justice. You have promised, and to <lb/> that promise I trust.</p>
                    <p>If you choose to fly from this scene, to withdraw <reg orig="your-|self"
                            >yourself</reg>
                        <lb/> from what you may conceive to be a theatre of guilt or <lb/> peril,
                        the avenues are open; retire unmolested and in <reg orig="si-|lence"
                            >silence</reg>. <lb/> If you have a man-like spirit, if you are grateful
                        <lb/> for the benefits bestowed upon you, if your discernment <lb/> enables
                        you to see that compliance with my request will <reg orig="en-|tangle"
                            >entangle</reg>
                        <lb/> you in no guilt, and betray you into no danger, stay, <lb/> and aid me
                        in hiding these remains from human scrutiny.</p>
                    <p>Watson is beyond the reach of further injury. I never <lb/> intended him
                        harm, though I have torn from him his sister <lb/> and friend, and have
                        brought his life to an untimely close. <lb/> To provide him a grave, is a
                        duty that I owe to the dead and <lb/> to the living. I shall quickly place
                        myself beyond the <lb/> reach of inquisitors and judges, but would willingly
                        rescue <lb/>
                        <pb n="98" entity="eaf033v2_0111" pid="uva-lib:349418"/> from molestation or
                        suspicion those whom I shall leave <reg orig="be-|hind">behind</reg>.</p>
                    <p>What would have been the fruit of deliberation, if I had <lb/> had the time
                        or power to deliberate, I know not. My <lb/> thoughts flowed with tumult and
                        rapidity. To shut this <lb/> spectacle from my view was the first impulse;
                        but to desert <lb/> this man, in a time of so much need, appeared a
                        thankless <lb/> and dastardly deportment. To remain where I was, to <reg
                            orig="con-|form">conform</reg>
                        <lb/> implicitly to his direction, required no effort. Some <lb/> fear was
                        connected with his presence, and with that of the <lb/> dead; but, in the
                        tremulous confusion of my present thoughts, <lb/> solitude would conjure up
                        a thousand phantoms.</p>
                    <p>I made no preparation to depart. I did not verbally <lb/> assent to his
                        proposal. He interpreted my silence into <reg orig="ac-|quiesence"
                            >acquiesence</reg>. <lb/> He wrapped the body in the carpet, and then
                        <lb/> lifting one end, cast at me a look which indicated his <reg
                            orig="ex-|pectations">expectations</reg>, <lb/> that I would aid him in
                        lifting this ghastly burthen. <lb/> During this process, the silence was
                        unbroken.</p>
                    <p>I knew not whither he intended to convey the corpse. <lb/> He had talked of
                        burial, but no receptacle had been <reg orig="pro-|vided">provided</reg>.
                        <lb/> How far safety might depend upon his conduct in <lb/> this particular,
                        I was unable to estimate. I was in too <lb/> heartless a mood to utter my
                        doubts. I followed his <reg orig="exam-|ple">example</reg>
                        <lb/> in raising the corpse from the floor.</p>
                    <p>He led the way into the passage and down stairs. <reg orig="Hav-|ing"
                            >Having</reg>
                        <lb/> reached the first floor, he unbolted a door which led <lb/> into the
                        cellar. The stairs and passage were illuminated by <lb/> lamps, that hung
                        from the ceiling, and were accustomed to <lb/> burn during the night. Now,
                        however, we were entering <lb/> darksome and murky recesses.</p>
                    <p>Return, said he, in a tone of command, and fetch the <lb/> light. I will wait
                        for you.</p>
                    <p>I obeyed. As I returned with the light, a suspicion stole <lb/> into my mind,
                        that Welbeck had taken this opportunity to <lb/> fly; and that on regaining
                        the foot of the stairs, I should <lb/> find the spot deserted by all but the
                        dead. My blood was <lb/> chilled by this image. The momentary resolution it
                        inspired <lb/> was to follow the example of the fugitive, and leave the
                        <lb/> persons whom the ensuing day might convene on this spot, <lb/> to form
                        their own conjectures as to the cause of this <reg orig="catas-|trophe"
                            >catastrophe</reg>.</p>
                    <pb n="99" entity="eaf033v2_0112" pid="uva-lib:349419"/>
                    <p>Meanwhile, I cast anxious eyes forward. Welbeck was <lb/> discovered in the
                        same place and posture in which he had <lb/> been left, lifting the corpse
                        and its shroud in his arms he <lb/> directed me to follow him. The vaults
                        beneath were lofty <lb/> and spacious. He passed from one to the other till
                        we <lb/> reached a small and remote cell. Here he cast his burthen <lb/> on
                        the ground. In the fall, the face of Watson chanced to <lb/> be disengaged
                        from its covering. Its closed eyes and sunken <lb/> muscles were rendered,
                        in a tenfold degree, ghastly and <lb/> rueful by the feeble light which the
                        candle shed upon it.</p>
                    <p>This object did not escape the attention of Welbeck. He <lb/> leaned against
                        the wall, and folding his arms resigned <reg orig="him-|self">himself</reg>
                        <lb/> to reverie. He gazed upon the countenance of Watson, <lb/> but his
                        looks denoted his attention to be elsewhere employed.</p>
                    <p>As to me, my state will not be easily described. My <lb/> eye roved fearfully
                        from one object to another. By turns it <lb/> was fixed upon the murdered
                        person and the murderer. The <lb/> narrow cell in which we stood, its rudely
                        fashioned walls <lb/> and arches, destitute of communication with the
                        external <lb/> air, and its palpable dark scarcely penetrated by the rays of
                        <lb/> a solitary candle, added to the silence which was deep and <lb/>
                        universal, produced an impression on my fancy which no <lb/> time will
                        obliterate.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps my imagination was distempered by terror. The <lb/> incident which I
                        am going to relate may appear to have <lb/> existed only in my fancy. Be
                        that as it may, I experienced <lb/> all the effects which the fullest belief
                        is adapted to produce. <lb/> Glancing vaguely at the countenance of Watson,
                        my <reg orig="atten-|tion">attention</reg>
                        <lb/> was arrested by a convulsive motion in the eye-lids. <lb/> This motion
                        increased, till, at length the eyes opened, and a <lb/> glance, languid but
                        wild, was thrown around. Instantly they <lb/> closed, and the tremulous
                        appearance vanished.</p>
                    <p>I started from my place and was on the point of uttering <lb/> some
                        involuntary exclamation. At the same moment, <lb/> Welbeck seemed to recover
                        from his reverie.</p>
                    <p>How is this! said he. Why do we linger here? Every <lb/> moment is precious.
                        We cannot dig for him a grave with <lb/> our hands. Wait here, while I go in
                        search of a spade.</p>
                    <p>Saying this, he snatched the candle from my hand, and <lb/> hasted away. My
                        eye followed the light as its gleams shifted <lb/> their place upon the
                        walls and ceilings, and gradually <reg orig="van-|ishing">vanishing</reg>, <lb/>
                        <pb n="100" entity="eaf033v2_0113" pid="uva-lib:349420"/> gave place to
                        unrespited gloom. This proceeding <lb/> was so unexpected and abrupt, that I
                        had no time to <reg orig="remon-|strate">remonstrate</reg>
                        <lb/> against it. Before I retrieved the power of reflection <lb/> the light
                        had disappeared and the footsteps were no longer <lb/> to be heard.</p>
                    <p>I was not on ordinary occasions, destitute of equanimity, <lb/> but, perhaps
                        the imagination of man is naturally abhorrent <lb/> of death, until tutored
                        into indifference by habit. Every <lb/> circumstance combined to fill me
                        with shuddering and <lb/> panic. For a while, I was enabled to endure my
                        situation <lb/> by the exertions of my reason. That the lifeless remains of
                        <lb/> a human being are powerless to injure or benefit, I was <reg
                            orig="tho-|roughly">thoroughly</reg>
                        <lb/> persuaded. I summoned this belief to my aid, and <lb/> was able, if
                        not to subdue, yet to curb my fears. I listened <lb/> to catch the sound of
                        the returning footsteps of Welbeck, <lb/> and hoped that every new moment
                        would terminate my <reg orig="soli-|tude">solitude</reg>.</p>
                    <p>No signal of his coming was afforded. At length it <reg orig="oc-|curred"
                            >occurred</reg>
                        <lb/> to me that Welbeck had gone with no intention to <lb/> return; that
                        his malice had seduced me hither, to encounter <lb/> the consequences of his
                        deed. He had fled and barred <lb/> every door behind him. This suspicion may
                        well be <reg orig="sup-|posed">supposed</reg>
                        <lb/> to overpower my courage, and to call forth desperate <lb/> efforts for
                        my deliverance.</p>
                    <p>I extended my hands and went forward. I had been too <lb/> little attentive
                        to the situation and direction of these vaults <lb/> and passages, to go
                        forward with undeviating accuracy. <lb/> My fears likewise tended to confuse
                        my perceptions and <lb/> bewilder my steps. Notwithstanding the danger of
                            <reg orig="en-|countering">encountering</reg>
                        <lb/> obstructions; I rushed towards the entrance with <lb/>
                        precipitation.</p>
                    <p>My temerity was quickly punished. In a moment, I was <lb/> repelled by a
                        jutting angle of the wall, with such force that I <lb/> staggered backward
                        and fell. The blow was stunning, and <lb/> when I recovered my senses, I
                        perceived that a torrent of <lb/> blood was gushing from my nostrils. My
                        clothes were <lb/> moistened with this unwelcome effusion, and I could not
                        but <lb/> reflect on the hazard which I should incur by being detected <lb/>
                        in this recess, covered by these accusing stains.</p>
                    <p>This reflection once more set me on my feet, and incited <lb/> my exertions.
                        I now proceeded with greater wariness and <lb/>
                        <pb n="101" entity="eaf033v2_0114" pid="uva-lib:349421">

                        </pb> caution. I had lost all distinct notions of my way. My <reg
                            orig="mo-|tions">motions</reg>
                        <lb/> were at random. All my labor was to shun <reg orig="obstruc-|tions"
                            >obstructions</reg>
                        <lb/> and to advance whenever the vacuity would permit. <lb/> By this means,
                        the entrance was at length found, and after <lb/> various efforts, I
                        arrived, beyond my hopes, at the foot of <lb/> the staircase.</p>
                    <p>I ascended, but quickly encountered an insuperable <reg orig="impe-|diment"
                            >impediment</reg>. <lb/> The door at the stair head, was closed and
                        barred. <lb/> My utmost strength was exerted in vain, to break the lock
                        <lb/> or the hinges. Thus were my direst apprehensions fulfilled. <lb/>
                        Welbeck had left me to sustain the charge of murder; to <lb/> obviate
                        suspicions the most atrocious and plausible that the <lb/> course of human
                        events is capable of producing.</p>
                    <p>Here I must remain till the morrow; till some one can <lb/> be made to
                        overhear my calls and come to my deliverance. <lb/> What effects will my
                        appearance produce on the spectator! <lb/> Terrified by phantoms and stained
                        with blood shall I not <lb/> exhibit the tokens of a maniac as well as an
                        assassin?</p>
                    <p>The corpse of Watson will quickly be discovered. If <lb/> previous to this
                        disclosure I should change my blood-stained <lb/> garments and withdraw into
                        the country, shall I not be <reg orig="pur-|sued">pursued</reg>
                        <lb/> by the most vehement suspicions, and, perhaps, hunted <lb/> to my
                        obscurest retreat by the ministers of justice? I am <lb/> innocent, but my
                        tale however circumstantial or true, will <lb/> scarcely suffice for my
                        vindication. My flight will be <reg orig="con-|strued">construed</reg>
                        <lb/> into a proof of incontestable guilt.</p>
                    <p>While harassed by these thoughts my attention was <lb/> attracted by a faint
                        gleam cast upon the bottom of the <reg orig="stair-|case">staircase</reg>.
                        <lb/> It grew stronger, hovered for a moment in my sight, <lb/> and then
                        disappeared. That it proceeded from a lamp or <lb/> candle, borne by some
                        one along the passages was no <reg orig="untena-|ble">untenable</reg>
                        <lb/> opinion, but was far less probable than that the <reg
                            orig="efful-|gence">effulgence</reg>
                        <lb/> was meteorous. I confided in the latter supposition <lb/> and
                        fortified myself anew against the dread of preternatural <lb/> dangers. My
                        thoughts reverted to the contemplation of the <lb/> hazards and suspicions
                        which flowed from my continuance <lb/> in this spot.</p>
                    <p>In the midst of my perturbed musing, my attention was <lb/> again recalled by
                        an illumination like the former. Instead <lb/> of hovering and vanishing, it
                        was permanent. No ray could <lb/>
                        <pb n="102" entity="eaf033v2_0115" pid="uva-lib:349422"/> be more feeble,
                        but the tangible obscurity to which it <reg orig="suc-|ceeded"
                            >succeeded</reg>
                        <lb/> rendered it conspicuous as an electrical flash. For <lb/> a while I
                        eyed it without moving from my place, and in <lb/> momentary expectation of
                        its disappearance.</p>
                    <p>Remarking its stability, the propriety of scrutinizing it <lb/> more nearly,
                        and of ascertaining the source whence it flowed, <lb/> was at length
                        suggested. Hope, as well as curiosity, was the <lb/> parent of my conduct.
                        Though utterly at a loss to assign <lb/> the cause of this appearance, I was
                        willing to believe some <lb/> connexion between that cause and the means of
                        my <reg orig="deliver-|ance">deliverance</reg>.</p>
                    <p>I had scarcely formed the resolution of descending the <lb/> stair, when my
                        hope was extinguished by the recollection <lb/> that the cellar had narrow
                        and grated windows, through <lb/> which light from the street might possibly
                        have found access. <lb/> A second recollection supplanted this belief, for
                        in my way <lb/> to this staircase, my attention would have been solicited,
                        <lb/> and my steps, in some degree, been guided by light coming <lb/>
                        through these avenues.</p>
                    <p>Having returned to the bottom of the stair, I perceived <lb/> every part of
                        the long drawn passage illuminated. I threw <lb/> a glance forward, to the
                        quarter whence the rays seemed to <lb/> proceed, and beheld, at a
                        considerable distance, Welbeck in <lb/> the cell which I had left, turning
                        up the earth with a spade.</p>
                    <p>After a pause of astonishment, the nature of the error <lb/> which I had
                        committed rushed upon my apprehension. I <lb/> now perceived that the
                        darkness had misled me to a different <lb/> staircase from that which I had
                        originally descended. It was <lb/> apparent that Welbeck intended me no
                        evil, but had really <lb/> gone in search of the instrument which he had
                        mentioned.</p>
                    <p>This discovery overwhelmed me with contrition and <lb/> shame, though it
                        freed me from the terrors of imprisonment <lb/> and accusation. To return to
                        the cell which I had left, and <lb/> where Welbeck was employed in his
                        disastrous office, was <lb/> the expedient which regard to my own safety
                        unavoidably <lb/> suggested.</p>
                    <p>Welbeck paused at my approach, and betrayed a <reg orig="momen-|tary"
                            >momentary</reg>
                        <lb/> consternation at the sight of my ensanguined visage. <lb/> The blood,
                        by some inexplicable process of nature, perhaps <lb/> by the counteracting
                        influence of fear, had quickly ceased <lb/> to flow. Whether the cause of my
                        evasion, and of my flux <lb/>
                        <pb n="103" entity="eaf033v2_0116" pid="uva-lib:349423"/> of blood, was
                        guessed, or whether his attention was <reg orig="with-|drawn"
                            >withdrawn</reg>, <lb/> by more momentous objects, from my condition, he
                        <lb/> proceeded in his task in silence.</p>
                    <p>A shallow bed, and a slight covering of clay was provided <lb/> for the
                        hapless Watson. Welbeck's movements were <reg orig="hur-|ried">hurried</reg>
                        <lb/> and tremulous. His countenance betokened a mind <lb/> engrossed by a
                        single purpose, in some degree foreign to <lb/> the scene before him. An
                        intensity and fixedness of features, <lb/> were conspicuous, that led me to
                        suspect the subversion of <lb/> his reason.</p>
                    <p>Having finished the task, he threw aside his implement. <lb/> He then put
                        into my hand a pocket-book, saying it belonged <lb/> to Watson, and might
                        contain something serviceable to the <lb/> living. I might make what use of
                        it I thought proper. He <lb/> then remounted the stairs, and, placing the
                        candle on a table <lb/> in the hall, opened the principal door and went
                        forth. I was <lb/> driven, by a sort of mechanical impulse, in his
                        footsteps. <lb/> I followed him because it was agreeable to him and because
                        I <lb/> knew not whither else to direct my steps.</p>
                    <p>The streets were desolate and silent. The watchman's <lb/> call remotely and
                        faintly heard, added to the general <reg orig="solem-|nity">solemnity</reg>.
                        <lb/> I followed my companion in a state of mind not easily <lb/> described.
                        I had no spirit even to inquire whither he was <lb/> going. It was not till
                        we arrived at the water's edge that I <lb/> persuaded myself to break
                        silence. I then began to reflect <lb/> on the degree in which his present
                        schemes might endanger <lb/> Welbeck or myself. I had acted long enough a
                        servile <lb/> and mechanical part; and been guided by blind and foreign
                        <lb/> impulses. It was time to lay aside my fetters, and demand <lb/> to
                        know whither the path tended in which I was importuned <lb/> to walk.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile I found myself intangled among boats and <lb/> shipping. I am
                        unable to describe the spot by any <reg orig="indispu-|table"
                            >indisputable</reg>
                        <lb/> tokens. I know merely that it was the termination of <lb/> one of the
                        principal streets. Here Welbeck selected a boat <lb/> and prepared to enter
                        it. For a moment I hesitated to <reg orig="com-|ply">comply</reg>
                        <lb/> with his apparent invitation. I stammered out an <reg
                            orig="inter-|rogation">interrogation</reg>. <lb/> Why is this? Why
                        should we cross the river? <lb/> What service can I do for you? I ought to
                        know the purpose <lb/> of my voyage before I enter it.</p>
                    <p>He checked himself and surveyed me for a minute in <lb/>
                        <pb n="104" entity="eaf033v2_0117" pid="uva-lib:349424"/> silence. What do
                        you fear? said he. Have I not <reg orig="explain-|ed">explained</reg>
                        <lb/> my wishes? Merely cross the river with me, for I cannot <lb/> navigate
                        a boat by myself. Is there any thing arduous or <lb/> mysterious in this
                        undertaking? we part on the Jersey shore, <lb/> and I shall leave you to
                        your destiny. All I shall ask from <lb/> you will be silence, and to hide
                        from mankind what you <lb/> know concerning me.</p>
                    <p>He now entered the boat and urged me to follow his <reg orig="ex-|ample"
                            >example</reg>. <lb/> I reluctantly complied. I perceived that the boat
                        <lb/> contained but one oar and that was a small one. He <reg
                            orig="seem-|ed">seemed</reg>
                        <lb/> startled and thrown into great perplexity by this <reg
                            orig="dis-|covery">discovery</reg>. <lb/> It will be impossible, said
                        he, in a tone of panic <lb/> and vexation, to procure another at this hour;
                        what is to be <lb/> done?</p>
                    <p>This impediment was by no means insuperable. I had <lb/> sinewy arms and knew
                        well how to use an oar for the double <lb/> purpose of oar and rudder. I
                        took my station at the stern, <lb/> and quickly extricated the boat from its
                        neighbors and from <lb/> the wharves. I was wholly unacquainted with the
                        river. <lb/> The bar, by which it was incumbered, I knew to exist, but <lb/>
                        in what direction and to what extent it existed, and how it <lb/> might be
                        avoided in the present state of the tide, I knew not. <lb/> It was probable,
                        therefore, unknowing as I was of the proper <lb/> track, that our boat would
                        speedily have grounded.</p>
                    <p>My attention, meanwhile, was fixed upon the oar. My <lb/> companion sat at
                        the prow and was in a considerable degree <lb/> unnoticed. I cast my eyes
                        occasionally at the scene which <lb/> I had left. Its novelty, joined with
                        the incidents of my <reg orig="con-|dition">condition</reg>, <lb/> threw me
                        into a state of suspense and wonder which <lb/> frequently slackened my
                        hand, and left the vessel to be <lb/> driven by the downward current. Lights
                        were sparingly <lb/> seen, and these were perpetually fluctuating, as masts,
                        yards, <lb/> and hulls were interposed, and passed before them. In <lb/>
                        proportion as we receded from the shore, the clamors <reg orig="seem-|ed"
                            >seemed</reg>
                        <lb/> to multiply, and the suggestion that the city was involved <lb/> in
                        confusion and uproar, did not easily give way to maturer <lb/> thoughts. <hi
                            rend="italic">Twelve</hi> was the hour cried, and this ascended <lb/> at
                        once from all quarters, and was mingled with the baying <lb/> of dogs, so as
                        to produce trepidation and alarm.</p>
                    <p>From this state of magnificent and awful feeling, I was <lb/> suddenly called
                        by the conduct of Welbeck. We had <lb/>
                        <pb n="105" entity="eaf033v2_0118" pid="uva-lib:349425"/> scarcely moved two
                        hundred yards from the shore, when he <lb/> plunged into the water. The
                        first conception was that some <lb/> implement or part of the boat had
                        fallen overboard. I <reg orig="look-|ed">looked</reg>
                        <lb/> back and perceived that his seat was vacant. In my <lb/> first
                        astonishment I loosened my hold of the oar, and it <lb/> floated away. The
                        surface was smooth as glass and the <lb/> eddy occasioned by his sinking was
                        scarcely visible. I had <lb/> not time to determine whether this was
                        designed or <reg orig="acci-|dental">accidental</reg>. <lb/> Its suddenness
                        deprived me of the power to exert <lb/> myself for his succor. I wildly
                        gazed around me in hopes <lb/> of seeing him rise. After some time my
                        attention was <lb/> drawn, by the sound of agitation in the water, to a <reg
                            orig="consider-|able">considerable</reg>
                        <lb/> distance.</p>
                    <p>It was too dark for any thing to be distinctly seen. There <lb/> was no cry
                        for help. The noise was like that of one <reg orig="vig-|orously"
                            >vigorously</reg>
                        <lb/> struggling for a moment, and then sinking to the <lb/> bottom. I
                        listened with painful eagerness, but was unable <lb/> to distinguish a third
                        signal. He sunk to rise no more.</p>
                    <p>I was for a time, inattentive to my own situation. The <lb/> dreadfulness,
                        and unexpectedness of this catastrophe <reg orig="occu-|pied">occupied</reg>
                        <lb/> me wholly. The quick motion of the lights upon the <lb/> shore, shewed
                        me that I was borne rapidly along with the <lb/> tide. How to help myself,
                        how to impede my course, or to <lb/> regain either shore, since I had lost
                        the oar, I was unable to <lb/> tell. I was no less at a loss to conjecture
                        whither the current, <lb/> if suffered to control my vehicle, would finally
                        transport <lb/> me.</p>
                    <p>The disappearance of lights and buildings, and the <reg orig="dimi-|nution"
                            >diminution</reg>
                        <lb/> of the noises, acquainted me that I had passed the <lb/> town. It was
                        impossible longer to hesitate. The shore <lb/> was to be regained by one way
                        only, which was swimming. <lb/> To any exploit of this kind, my strength and
                        my skill were <lb/> adequate. I threw away my loose gown; put the pocket
                        <lb/> book of the unfortunate Watson in my mouth, to preserve <lb/> it from
                        being injured by moisture; and committed myself <lb/> to the stream.</p>
                    <p>I landed in a spot incommoded with mud and reeds. I <lb/> sunk knee deep into
                        the former, and was exhausted by the <lb/> fatigue of extricating myself. At
                        length I recovered firm <lb/> ground, and threw myself on the turf to repair
                        my wasted <lb/>
                        <pb n="106" entity="eaf033v2_0119" pid="uva-lib:349426"/> strength, and to
                        reflect on the measures which my future <lb/> welfare enjoined me to
                        pursue.</p>
                    <p>What condition was ever parallel to mine? The <reg orig="trans-|actions"
                            >transactions</reg>
                        <lb/> of the last three days, resembled the monstrous <lb/> creations of
                        delirium. They were painted with vivid hues <lb/> on my memory; but so rapid
                        and incongruous were these <lb/> transitions, that I almost denied belief to
                        their reality. They <lb/> exercised a bewildering and stupifying influence
                        on my mind, <lb/> from which the meditations of an hour were scarcely <reg
                            orig="suffi-|cient">sufficient</reg>
                        <lb/> to relieve me. Gradually I recovered the power of <lb/> arranging my
                        ideas, and forming conclusions.</p>
                    <p>Welbeck was dead. His property was swallowed up, <lb/> and his creditors left
                        to wonder at his disappearance. All <lb/> that was left, was the furniture
                        of his house, to which Mrs. <lb/> Wentworth would lay claim, in discharge of
                        the unpaid rent. <lb/> What now was the destiny that awaited the lost and
                            <reg orig="friend-|less">friendless</reg>
                        <lb/> Mademoiselle Lodi. Where was she concealed? <reg orig="Wel-|beck"
                            >Welbeck</reg>
                        <lb/> had dropped no intimation by which I might be led to <lb/> suspect the
                        place of her abode. If my power, in other <lb/> respects, could have
                        contributed aught to her relief, my <lb/> ignorance of her asylum had
                        utterly disabled me.</p>
                    <p>But what of the murdered person? He had suddenly <lb/> vanished from the face
                        of the earth. His fate and the place <lb/> of his interment would probably
                        be suspected and ascertained. <lb/> Was I sure to escape from the
                        consequences of this deed? <lb/> Watson had relatives and friends. What
                        influence on their <lb/> state and happiness his untimely and mysterious
                        fate would <lb/> possess, it was obvious to inquire. This idea led me to the
                        <lb/> recollection of his pocket-book. Some papers might be <lb/> there
                        explanatory of his situation.</p>
                    <p>I resumed my feet. I knew not where to direct my steps. <lb/> I was dropping
                        with wet, and shivering with the cold. I <lb/> was destitute of habitation
                        and friend. I had neither money, <lb/> nor any valuable thing in my
                        possession. I moved forward, <lb/> mechanically and at random. Where I
                        landed was at no <lb/> great distance from the verge of the town. In a short
                        time <lb/> I discovered the glimmering of a distant lamp. To this I <lb/>
                        directed my steps, and here I paused to examine the <reg orig="con-|tents"
                            >contents</reg>
                        <lb/> of the pocket-book.</p>
                    <p>I found three bank notes, each of fifty dollars, enclosed <lb/> in a piece of
                        blank paper. Besides these were three letters, <lb/>
                        <pb n="107" entity="eaf033v2_0120" pid="uva-lib:349427"/> apparently written
                        by his wife, and dated at Baltimore. <lb/> They were brief, but composed in
                        a strain of great <reg orig="tender-|ness">tenderness</reg>, <lb/> and
                        containing affecting allusions to their child. I <lb/> could gather from
                        their date and tenor, that they were <reg orig="re-|ceived">received</reg>
                        <lb/> during his absence on his recent voyage; that her <lb/> condition was
                        considerably necessitous, and surrounded by <lb/> wants which their
                        prolonged separation had increased.</p>
                    <p>The fourth letter was open, and seemed to have been very <lb/> lately
                        written. It was directed to Mrs. Mary Watson. He <lb/> informed her in it of
                        his arrival at Philadelphia from St. <lb/> Domingo; of the loss of his ship
                        and cargo; and of his <reg orig="in-|tention">intention</reg>
                        <lb/> to hasten home with all possible expedition. He <lb/> told her that
                        all was lost but one hundred and fifty dollars, <lb/> the greater part of
                        which he should bring with him, to <reg orig="re-|lieve">relieve</reg>
                        <lb/> her more pressing wants. The letter was signed, and <lb/> folded, and
                        superscribed, but unsealed.</p>
                    <p>A little consideration shewed me, in what manner it <reg orig="be-|came"
                            >became</reg>
                        <lb/> me, on this occasion, to demean myself. I put the <lb/> bank notes in
                        the letter, and sealed it with a wafer; a few of <lb/> which were found in
                        the pocket-book. I hesitated some <lb/> time whether I should add any thing
                        to the information <lb/> which the letter contained, by means of a pencil
                        which <reg orig="of-|fered">offered</reg>
                        <lb/> itself to my view; but I concluded to forbear. I could <lb/> select no
                        suitable terms in which to communicate the <reg orig="mourn-|ful"
                            >mournful</reg>
                        <lb/> truth. I resolved to deposit this letter at the post-office, <lb/>
                        where I knew letters could be left at all hours.</p>
                    <p>My reflections at length, reverted to my own condition. <lb/> What was the
                        fate reserved for me? How far my safety <lb/> might be affected by remaining
                        in the city, in consequence <lb/> of the disappearance of Welbeck, and my
                        known connexion <lb/> with the fugitive, it was impossible to foresee. My
                        fears <lb/> readily suggested innumerable embarrassments and <reg
                            orig="incon-|veniences">inconveniences</reg>
                        <lb/> which would flow from this source. Besides, on <lb/> what pretence
                        should I remain? To whom could I apply <lb/> for protection or employment?
                        All avenues, even to <reg orig="sub-|sistence">subsistence</reg>, <lb/> were
                        shut against me. The country was my sole <lb/> asylum. Here, in exchange for
                        my labor, I could at least <lb/> purchase food, safety, and repose. But if
                        my choice <reg orig="point-|ed">pointed</reg>
                        <lb/> to the country, there was no reason for a moment's delay. <lb/> It
                        would be prudent to regain the fields, and be far from <lb/> this detested
                        city before the rising of the sun.</p>
                    <pb n="108" entity="eaf033v2_0121" pid="uva-lib:349428"/>
                    <p>Meanwhile I was chilled and chafed by the clothes that I <lb/> wore. To
                        change them for others was absolutely necessary <lb/> to my ease. The
                        clothes which I wore were not my own, <lb/> and were extremely unsuitable to
                        my new condition. My <lb/> rustic and homely garb was deposited in my
                        chamber at <lb/> Welbeck's. These thoughts suggested the design of <reg
                            orig="re-|turning">returning</reg>
                        <lb/> thither. I considered, that, probably, the servants <lb/> had not been
                        alarmed. That the door was unfastened, and <lb/> the house was accessible.
                        It would be easy to enter and <lb/> retire without notice; and this, not
                        without some waverings <lb/> and misgivings, I presently determined to
                        do.</p>
                    <p>Having deposited my letter at the office, I proceeded to <lb/> my late abode.
                        I approached, and lifted the latch with <lb/> caution. There were no
                        appearances of any one having <lb/> been disturbed. I procured a light in
                        the kitchen, and hied <lb/> softly and with dubious footsteps to my chamber.
                        There I <lb/> disrobed, and resumed my check shirt, and trowsers, and <lb/>
                        fustian coat. This change being accomplished, nothing <reg orig="re-|mained"
                            >remained</reg>
                        <lb/> but that I should strike into the country with the <reg
                            orig="ut-|most">utmost</reg>
                        <lb/> expedition.</p>
                    <p>In a momentary review which I took of the past, the design <lb/> for which
                        Welbeck professed to have originally detained me <lb/> in his service,
                        occurred to my mind. I knew the danger <lb/> of reasoning loosely on the
                        subject of property. To any <lb/> trinket, or piece of furniture in this
                        house, I did not allow <lb/> myself to question the right of Mrs. Wentworth;
                        a right <reg orig="ac-|cruing">accruing</reg>
                        <lb/> to her in consequence of Welbeck's failure in the <reg
                            orig="pay-|ment">payment</reg>
                        <lb/> of his rent; but there was one thing which I felt an <lb/>
                        irresistible desire, and no scruples which should forbid me, <lb/> to
                        possess, and that was, the manuscript to which Welbeck <lb/> had alluded, as
                        having been written by the deceased Lodi.</p>
                    <p>I was well instructed in Latin, and knew the Tuscan <reg orig="lan-|guage"
                            >language</reg>
                        <lb/> to be nearly akin to it. I despaired not of being at <lb/> sometime
                        able to cultivate this language, and believed that <lb/> the possession of
                        this manuscript might essentially contribute <lb/> to this end, as well as
                        to many others equally beneficial. It <lb/> was easy to conjecture that the
                        volume was to be found <lb/> among his printed books, and it was scarcely
                        less easy to <lb/> ascertain the truth of this conjecture. I entered, not
                            <reg orig="with-|out">without</reg>
                        <lb/> tremulous sensations, into the apartment which had been <lb/> the

                        the former rise before me.</p>
                    <p>Numerous and splendid volumes were arranged on <reg orig="ma-|hogany"

                        their names, and was at length so fortunate as <lb/> to light upon the book
                        of which I was in search. I <reg orig="imme-|diately">immediately</reg>
                        <lb/> secured it, and leaving the candle extinguished on <lb/> a table in

                        and palpitating heart I turned my <lb/> face towards the country. My
                        necessitous condition I <reg orig="be-|lieved">believed</reg>
                        <lb/> would justify me in passing without payment the <lb/> Schuylkill
                        bridge, and the eastern sky began to brighten <lb/> with the dawn of morning
                        not till I had gained the distance <lb/> of nine miles from the city.</p>
                    <p>Such is the tale which I proposed to relate to you. Such <lb/> are the
                        memorable incidents of five days of my life; from <lb/> which I have
                        gathered more instruction than from the whole <lb/> tissue of my previous
                        existence. Such are the particulars <lb/> of my knowledge respecting the
                        crimes and misfortunes of <lb/> Welbeck; which the insinuations of Wortley,
                        and my desire <lb/> to retain your good opinion, have induced me to
                        unfold.</p>

                        the <lb/> particulars of his narration, and to compare them with the <lb/>
                        facts, with a knowledge of which, their own observation had <lb/> supplied
                        them. My profession introduced me to the <reg orig="friend-|ship"
                            >friendship</reg>
                        <lb/> of Mrs. Wentworth, by whom, after the disappearance <lb/> of Welbeck,
                        many circumstances respecting him had been <lb/> mentioned. She particularly
                        dwelt upon the deportment <lb/> and appearance of this youth, at the single
                        interview which <lb/> took place between them, and her representations were
                        <lb/> perfectly conformable to those which Mervyn had himself <lb/>
                        delivered.</p>
                    <p>Previously to this interview, Welbeck had insinuated to <lb/> her that a
                        recent event had put him in possession of the truth <lb/> respecting the
                        destiny of Clavering. A kinsman of his, <lb/>
                        <pb n="110" entity="eaf033v2_0123" pid="uva-lib:349430"/> had arrived from
                        Portugal, by whom this intelligence had <lb/> been brought. He dexterously
                        eluded her entreaties to be <lb/> furnished with minuter information, or to
                        introduce this <reg orig="kins-|man">kinsman</reg>
                        <lb/> to her acquaintance. As soon as Mervyn was ushered <lb/> into her
                        presence, she suspected him to be the person to <lb/> whom Welbeck had
                        alluded, and this suspicion his <reg orig="conver-|sation"
                            >conversation</reg>
                        <lb/> had confirmed. She was at a loss to comprehend <lb/> the reasons of
                        the silence which he so pertinaciously <reg orig="main-|tained"
                            >maintained</reg>.</p>
                    <p>Her uneasiness, however, prompted her to renew her <reg
                            orig="soli-|citations">solicitations</reg>. <lb/> On the day, subsequent
                        to the catastrophe related <lb/> by Mervyn, she sent a messenger to Welbeck,
                        with a request <lb/> to see him. Gabriel, the black servant, informed the
                            <reg orig="mes-|senger">messenger</reg>
                        <lb/> that his master had gone into the country for a week. <lb/> At the end
                        of the week, a messenger was again despatched <lb/> with the same errand. He
                        called and knocked, but no one <lb/> answered his signals. He examined the
                        entrance by the <lb/> kitchen, but every avenue was closed. It appeared that
                        the <lb/> house was wholly deserted.</p>
                    <p>These appearances naturally gave birth to curiosity and <lb/> suspicion. The
                        house was repeatedly examined, but the <lb/> solitude and silence within
                        continued the same. The <reg orig="credi-|tors">creditors</reg>
                        <lb/> of Welbeck were alarmed by these appearances, and <lb/> their claims
                        to the property remaining in the house were <reg orig="pre-|cluded"
                            >precluded</reg>
                        <lb/> by Mrs. Wentworth, who, as owner of the mansion, <lb/> was legally
                        entitled to the furniture, in place of the rest <lb/> which Welbeck had
                        suffered to accumulate.</p>
                    <p>On examining the dwelling, all that was valuable and <lb/> portable,
                        particularly linen and plate, was removed. The <lb/> remainder was
                        distrained, but the tumults of pestilence <reg orig="suc-|ceeded"
                            >succeeded</reg>
                        <lb/> and hindered it from being sold. Things were <reg orig="allow-|ed"
                            >allowed</reg>
                        <lb/> to continue in their former situation, and the house was <lb/>
                        carefully secured. We had no leisure to form conjectures on <lb/> the causes
                        of this desertion. An explanation was afforded <lb/> us by the narrative of
                        this youth. It is probable that the <lb/> servants, finding their master's
                        absence continue, had <reg orig="pilla-|ged">pillaged</reg>
                        <lb/> the house and fled.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, though our curiosity with regard to Welbeck <lb/> was appeased, it
                        was obvious to inquire by what series of <lb/> inducements and events Mervyn
                        was reconducted to the city <lb/> and led to the spot where I first met with
                        him. We intimated <lb/>
                        <pb n="111" entity="eaf033v2_0124" pid="uva-lib:349431"/> our wishes in this
                        respect, and our young friend readily <reg orig="con-|sented"
                            >consented</reg>
                        <lb/> to take up the thread of his story and bring it down <lb/> to the
                        point that was desired. For this purpose, the <reg orig="ensu-|ing"
                            >ensuing</reg>
                        <lb/> evening was selected. Having, at an early hour, shut <lb/> ourselves
                        up from all intruders and visitors he continued as <lb/> follows.</p>
                    <p>I have mentioned that, by sunrise, I had gained the <reg orig="dis-|tance"
                            >distance</reg>
                        <lb/> of many miles from the city. My purpose was to stop <lb/> at the first
                        farm house, and seek employment as a day <reg orig="la-|borer"
                        >laborer</reg>. <lb/> The first person whom I observed was a man of <lb/>
                        placid mein and plain garb. Habitual benevolence was <reg orig="ap-|parent"
                            >apparent</reg>
                        <lb/> amidst the wrinkles of age. He was traversing his <lb/> buckwheat
                        field and measuring, as it seemed, the harvest <lb/> that was now nearly
                        ripe.</p>
                    <p>I accosted him with diffidence, and explained my wishes. <lb/> He listened to
                        my tale with complacency, inquired into my <lb/> name and family, and into
                        my qualifications for the office to <lb/> which I aspired. My answers were
                        candid and full.</p>
                    <p>Why, said he, I believe thou and I can make a bargain. <lb/> We will, at
                        least, try each other for a week or two. If it <lb/> does not suit our
                        mutual convenience we can change. The <lb/> morning is damp and cool, and
                        thy plight does not appear <lb/> the most comfortable that can be imagined.
                        Come to the <lb/> house and eat some breakfast.</p>
                    <p>The behaviour of this good man filled me with gratitude <lb/> and joy.
                        Methought I could embrace him as a father, and <lb/> entrance into his
                        house, appeared like return to a long lost <lb/> and much loved home. My
                        desolate and lonely condition <lb/> apeared to be changed for paternal
                        regards and the <reg orig="tender-|ness">tenderness</reg>
                        <lb/> of friendship.</p>
                    <p>These emotions were confirmed and heightened by every <lb/> object that
                        presented itself under this roof. The family <lb/> consisted of Mrs. Hadwin,
                        two simple and affectionate girls, <lb/> his daughters, and servants. The
                        manners of this family, <lb/> quiet, artless, and cordial, the occupations
                        allotted me, the <lb/> land by which the dwelling was surrounded, its pure
                        airs, <lb/> romantic walks, and exhaustless fertility, constituted a <reg
                            orig="power-|ful">powerful</reg>
                        <lb/> contrast to the scenes which I had left behind, and were <lb/>
                        congenial with every dictate of my understanding and every <lb/> sentiment
                        that glowed in my heart.</p>
                    <p>My youth, mental cultivation, and circumspect <reg orig="deport-|ment"
                            >deportment</reg>
                        <lb/>
                        <pb n="112" entity="eaf033v2_0125" pid="uva-lib:349432"/> entitled me to
                        deference and confidence. Each hour <lb/> confirmed me in the good opinion
                        of Mr. Hadwin, and in the <lb/> affections of his daughters. In the mind of
                        my employer, <lb/> the simplicity of the husbandman and the devotion of the
                        <lb/> Quaker, were blended with humanity and intelligence. The <lb/>
                        sisters, Susan and Eliza, were unacquainted with calamity <lb/> and vice,
                        through the medium of either observation or books. <lb/> They were strangers
                        to the benefits of an elaborate <reg orig="educa-|tion">education</reg>,
                        <lb/> but they were endowed with curiosity and discernment, <lb/> and had
                        not suffered their slender means of instruction to <lb/> remain
                        unimproved.</p>
                    <p>The sedateness of the elder formed an amusing contrast <lb/> with the
                        laughing eye and untamable vivacity of the younger; <lb/> but they smiled
                        and they wept in unison. They thought <lb/> and acted in different but not
                        discordant keys. On all <reg orig="mo-|mentous">momentous</reg>
                        <lb/> occasions, they reasoned and felt alike. In <reg orig="ordi-|nary"
                            >ordinary</reg>
                        <lb/> cases, they separated, as it were, into different tracks; <lb/> but
                        this diversity was productive, not of jarring, but of <reg orig="har-|mony"
                            >harmony</reg>.</p>
                    <p>A romantic and untutored disposition like mine, may be <lb/> supposed liable
                        to strong impressions from perpetual <reg orig="con-|verse">converse</reg>
                        <lb/> with persons of their age and sex. The elder was <lb/> soon discovered
                        to have already disposed of her affections. <lb/> The younger was free, and
                        somewhat that is more easily <lb/> conceived than named, stole insensibly
                        upon my heart. The <lb/> images that haunted me at home and abroad, in her
                        absence <lb/> and her presence gradually coalesced into one shape, and <lb/>
                        gave birth to an incessant train of latent palpitations and <lb/>
                        indefinable hopes. My days were little else than <reg orig="uninterrupt-|ed"
                            >uninterrupted</reg>
                        <lb/> reveries, and night only called up phantoms more vivid <lb/> and
                        equally enchanting.</p>
                    <p>The memorable incidents which had lately happened <lb/> scarcely
                        counterpoised my new sensations or diverted my <lb/> contemplations from the
                        present. My views were gradually <lb/> led to rest upon futurity, and in
                        that I quickly found cause <lb/> of circumspection and dread. My present
                        labors were light <lb/> and were sufficient for my subsistence in a single
                        state; but <lb/> wedlock was the parent of new wants and of new cares. <lb/>
                        Mr. Hadwin's possessions were adequate to his own frugal <lb/> maintenance,
                        but divided between his children, would be too <lb/> scanty for either.
                        Besides, this division could only take <lb/>

                            <fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">10*</fw>
                        </pb> place at his death, and that was an event whose speedy <reg
                            orig="oc-|currence">occurrence</reg>
                        <lb/> was neither desirable nor probable.</p>
                    <p>Another obstacle was now remembered. Hadwin was <lb/> the conscientious
                        member of a sect, which forbade the <lb/> marriage of its votaries with
                        those of a different communion. <lb/> I had been trained in an opposite
                        creed, and imagined it <lb/> impossible that I should ever become a
                        proselyte to <reg orig="Qua-|kerism">Quakerism</reg>. <lb/> It only remained
                        for me to feign conversion, or to <lb/> root out the opinions of my friend,
                        and win her consent <lb/> to a secret marriage. Whether hypocrisy was
                        eligible was <lb/> no subject of deliberation. If the possession of all that
                        <lb/> ambition can conceive, were added to the transports of union <lb/>
                        with Eliza Hadwin, and offered as the price of <reg orig="dissimula-|tion"
                            >dissimulation</reg>, <lb/> it would have been instantly rejected. My
                        external <lb/> goods were not abundant nor numerous, but the <reg
                            orig="conscious-|ness">consciousness</reg>
                        <lb/> of rectitude was mine; and, in competition with this, <lb/> the luxury
                        of the heart and of the senses, the gratifications <lb/> of boundless
                        ambition and inexhaustible wealth were <reg orig="con-|temptible"
                            >contemptible</reg>
                        <lb/> and frivolous.</p>
                    <p>The conquest of Eliza's errors was easy; but to <reg orig="intro-|duce"
                            >introduce</reg>
                        <lb/> discord and sorrow into this family, was an act of the <lb/> utmost
                        ingratitude and profligacy. It was only requisite for <lb/> my understanding
                        clearly to discern, to be convinced of the <lb/> insuperability of this
                        obstacle. It was manifest, therefore, <lb/> that the point to which my
                        wishes tended was placed beyond <lb/> my reach.</p>
                    <p>To foster my passion, was to foster a disease destructive <lb/> either of my
                        integrity or my existence. It was <reg orig="indispensa-|ble"
                            >indispensable</reg>
                        <lb/> to fix my thoughts upon a different object, and to debar <lb/> myself
                        even from her intercourse. To ponder on themes <lb/> foreign to my darling
                        image, and to seclude myself from <lb/> her society, at hours which had
                        usually been spent with her, <lb/> were difficult tasks. The latter was the
                        least practicable. <lb/> I had to contend with eyes, which alternately
                        wondered at, <lb/> and upbraided me for my unkindness. She was wholly <lb/>
                        unaware of the nature of her own feelings, and this <reg orig="igno-|rance"
                            >ignorance</reg>
                        <lb/> made her less scrupulous in the expression of her <lb/>
                        sentiments.</p>
                    <p>Hitherto I had needed not employment beyond myself <lb/> and my companions.
                        Now my new motives made me eager <lb/>
                        <pb n="114" entity="eaf033v2_0127" pid="uva-lib:349434"/> to discover some
                        means of controling and beguiling my <lb/> thoughts. In this state the
                        manuscript of Lodi occurred to <lb/> me. In my way hither, I had resolved to
                        make the study <lb/> of the language of this book, and the translation of
                        its <reg orig="con-|tents">contents</reg>
                        <lb/> into English, the business and solace of my leisure. <lb/> Now this
                        resolution was revived with new force.</p>
                    <p>My project was perhaps singular. The ancient language <lb/> of Italy
                        possessed a strong affinity with the modern. My <lb/> knowledge of the
                        former was my only means of gaining the <lb/> latter. I had no grammar or
                        vocabulary to explain how far <lb/> the meanings and inflections of Tuscan
                        words varied from <lb/> the Roman dialect. I was to ponder on each sentence
                        and <lb/> phrase; to select among different conjectures the most <lb/>
                        plausible, and to ascertain the true, by patient and repeated <lb/>
                        scrutiny.</p>
                    <p>This undertaking, fantastic and impracticable as it may <lb/> seem, proved
                        upon experiment, to be within the compass of <lb/> my powers. The detail of
                        my progress would be curious <lb/> and instructive. What impediments, in the
                        attainment of a <lb/> darling purpose, human ingenuity and patience are able
                        to <lb/> surmount; how much may be done by strenuous and <reg
                            orig="soli-|tary">solitary</reg>
                        <lb/> efforts; how the mind, unassisted, may draw forth the <lb/> principles
                        of inflection and arrangement; may profit by <reg orig="re-|mote"
                            >remote</reg>, <lb/> analogous, and latent similitudes, would be
                        forcibly <lb/> illustrated by my example; but the theme, however <reg
                            orig="attrac-|tive">attractive</reg>, <lb/> must, for the present, be
                        omitted.</p>
                    <p>My progress was slow; but the perception of hourly <reg orig="im-|provement"
                            >improvement</reg>
                        <lb/> afforded me unspeakable pleasure. Having <lb/> arrived near the last
                        pages, I was able to pursue, with little <lb/> interruption, the thread of
                        an eloquent narration. The <reg orig="tri-|umph">triumph</reg>
                        <lb/> of a leader of outlaws over the popular enthusiasm of <lb/> the
                        Milanese, and the claims of neighboring potentates, was <lb/> about to be
                        depicted. The <hi rend="italic">Condottiero</hi> Sforza, had taken <lb/>
                        refuge from his enemies in a tomb; accidentally discovered <lb/> amidst the
                        ruins of a Roman fortress in the Appenines. He <lb/> had sought this recess
                        for the sake of concealment, but found <lb/> in it a treasure, by which he
                        would be enabled to secure the <lb/> wavering and venal faith of that crew
                        of ruffians that followed <lb/> his standard, provided he fell not into the
                        hands of the <lb/> enemies who were now in search of him.</p>
                    <pb n="115" entity="eaf033v2_0128" pid="uva-lib:349435"/>
                    <p>My tumultuous curiosity was suddenly checked by the <lb/> following leaves
                        being glued together at the edges. To <lb/> dissever them without injury to
                        the written spaces, was <lb/> by no means easy. I proceeded to the task, not
                        without <lb/> precipitation. The edges were torn away, and the leaves <lb/>
                        parted.</p>
                    <p>It may be thought that I took up the thread where it had <lb/> been broken;
                        but no. The object that my eyes <reg orig="encoun-|tered">encountered</reg>,
                        <lb/> and which the cemented leaves had so long <reg orig="con-|cealed"
                            >concealed</reg>, <lb/> was beyond the power of the most capricious or
                        <lb/> lawless fancy to have prefigured; yet it bore a shadowy <lb/>
                        resemblance to the images with which my imagination was <lb/> previously
                        occupied. I opened, and beheld&mdash;<hi rend="italic">a bank note!</hi></p>
                    <p>To the first transports of surprise, the conjecture <reg orig="suc-|ceeded"
                            >succeeded</reg>, <lb/> that the remaining leaves, cemented together in
                        the <lb/> same manner, might enclose similar bills. They were <reg
                            orig="has-|tily">hastily</reg>
                        <lb/> separated, and the conjecture was verified. My <reg
                            orig="sensa-|tions">sensations</reg>, <lb/> at this discovery, were of
                        an inexplicable kind. I <lb/> gazed at the notes in silence. I moved my
                        finger over them; <lb/> held them in different positions; read and re-read
                        the name <lb/> of each sum, and the signature; added them together, and
                        <lb/> repeated to myself&mdash;<hi rend="italic">Twenty thousand
                            dollars!</hi> They are <lb/> mine, and by such means!</p>
                    <p>This sum would have redeemed the fallen fortunes of <lb/> Welbeck. The dying
                        Lodi was unable to communicate all <lb/> the contents of this inestimable
                        volume. He had divided <lb/> his treasure, with a view to its greater
                        safety, between this <lb/> volume and his pocket-book. Death hasted upon him
                        too <lb/> suddenly to allow him to explain his precautions. Welbeck <lb/>
                        had placed the book in his collection, purposing sometime <lb/> to peruse
                        it; but deterred by anxieties, which the perusal <lb/> would have
                        dissipated, he rushed to desperation and <reg orig="sui-|cide"
                        >suicide</reg>, <lb/> from which some evanescent contingency, by <reg
                            orig="unfold-|ing">unfolding</reg>
                        <lb/> this treasure to his view, would have effectually rescued <lb/>
                        him.</p>
                    <p>But was this event to be regretted? This sum, like the <lb/> former, would
                        probably have been expended in the same <lb/> pernicious prodigality. His
                        career would have continued <lb/> sometime longer, but his inveterate habits
                        would have finally <lb/> conducted his existence to the same criminal and
                            <reg orig="ignomini-|ous">ignominious</reg>
                        <lb/> close.</p>
                    <pb n="116" entity="eaf033v2_0129" pid="uva-lib:349436"/>
                    <p>But the destiny of Welbeck was accomplished. The <lb/> money was placed,
                        without guilt or artifice, in my <reg orig="posses-|sion">possession</reg>.
                        <lb/> My fortune had been thus unexpectedly and <reg orig="won-|drously"
                            >wondrously</reg>
                        <lb/> propitious. How was I to profit by her favor: <lb/> Would not this sum
                        enable me to gather round me all the <lb/> instruments of pleasure?
                        Equipage, and palace, and a <reg orig="mul-|titude">multitude</reg>
                        <lb/> of servants; polished mirrors, splendid hangings, <lb/> banquets, and
                        flatterers, were equally abhorrent to my taste, <lb/> and my principles. The
                        accumulation of knowledge, and <lb/> the diffusion of happiness, in which
                        riches may be rendered <lb/> eminently instrumental, were the only precepts
                        of duty, and <lb/> the only avenues to genuine felicity.</p>
                    <p>But what, said I, is my title to this money? By retaining <lb/> it, shall I
                        not be as culpable as Welbeck? It came into his <lb/> possession as it came
                        into mine, without a crime; but my <lb/> knowledge of the true proprietor is
                        equally certain, and the <lb/> claims of the unfortunate stranger are as
                        valid as ever. <lb/> Indeed, if utility, and not law, be the measure of
                        justice, <lb/> her claim, desolate and indigent as she is, unfitted, by her
                        <lb/> past life, by the softness and the prejudices of her education, <lb/>
                        for contending with calamity, is incontestable.</p>
                    <p>As to me, health and diligence will give me, not only the <lb/> competence
                        which I seek, but the power of enjoying it. If <lb/> my present condition be
                        unchangeable, I shall not be <reg orig="un-|happy">unhappy</reg>. <lb/> My
                        occupations are salutary and meritorious; I <lb/> am a stranger to the cares

                        possessed by me, <lb/> as long as I have eyes to gaze at man and at nature,
                        as they <lb/> are exhibited in their original forms or in books. The <reg

                    <p>Certain obstacles existed to the immediate execution of <lb/> this scheme.
                        How should I conduct my search? What <lb/> apology should I make for
                        withdrawing thus abruptly, and <lb/> contrary to the terms of an agreement
                        into which I had <lb/> lately entered, from the family and service of my
                        friend and <lb/> benefactor, Hadwin?</p>
                    <p>My thoughts were called away from pursuing these <reg orig="in-|quiries"
                            >inquiries</reg>
                        <lb/> by a rumor, which had gradually swelled to <reg orig="formida-|ble"
                            >formidable</reg>
                        <lb/> dimensions; and which, at length, reached us in our <lb/> quiet
                        retreats. The city, we were told, was involved in <lb/>
                        <pb n="117" entity="eaf033v2_0130" pid="uva-lib:349437"/> confusion and
                        panic, for a pestilential disease had begun its <lb/> destructive progress.
                        Magistrates and citizens were flying <lb/> to the country. The numbers of
                        the sick multiplied beyond <lb/> all example; even in the pest-affected
                        cities of the Levant. <lb/> The malady was malignant, and unsparing.</p>
                    <p>The usual occupations and amusements of life were at an <lb/> end. Terror had
                        exterminated all the sentiments of nature. <lb/> Wives were deserted by
                        husbands, and children by parents. <lb/> Some had shut themselves in their
                        houses, and debarred <lb/> themselves from all communication with the rest
                        of <reg orig="man-|kind">mankind</reg>. <lb/> The consternation of others
                        had destroyed their <reg orig="un-|derstanding">understanding</reg>, <lb/>
                        and their misguided steps hurried them into the <lb/> midst of the danger
                        which they had previously labored to <lb/> shun. Men were seized by this
                        disease in the streets; <reg orig="pas-|sengers">passengers</reg>
                        <lb/> fled from them; entrance into their own dwellings <lb/> was denied to
                        them; they perished in the public ways.</p>
                    <p>The chambers of disease were deserted, and the sick left <lb/> to die of
                        negligence. None could be found to remove the <lb/> lifeless bodies. Their
                        remains, suffered to decay by <reg orig="piece-|meal">piecemeal</reg>, <lb/>
                        filled the air with deadly exhalations, and added <reg orig="ten-|fold"

                        <lb/> to the devastation.</p>
                    <p>Such was the tale, distorted and diversified a thousand <lb/> ways, by the
                        credulity and exaggeration of the tellers. At <lb/> first I listened to the
                        story with indifference or mirth. <reg orig="Me-|thought">Methought</reg>
                        <lb/> it was confuted by its own extravagance. The <lb/> enormity and
                        variety of such an evil made it unworthy to be <lb/> believed. I expected
                        that every new day would detect the <lb/> absurdity and fallacy of such
                        representations. Every new <lb/> day, however, added to the number of
                        witnesses, and the <lb/> consistency of the tale, till, at length, it was
                        not possible to <lb/> withhold my faith.</p>

                        the witnesses and sufferers <lb/> of this calamity. This employment was not

                    <p>Others were very differently affected. As often as the <lb/> tale was

                        chilled and his stomach was <lb/> bereaved of its usual energies. A
                        temporary indisposition <lb/> was produced in many. Some were haunted by a

                    <p>Mr. Hadwin was superior to groundless apprehensions. <lb/> His daughters,

                        A year previous to this, he <lb/> had left the house of Mr. Hadwin, who was
                        his uncle, and <lb/> had removed to Philadelphia, in pursuit of fortune.</p>
                    <p>He made himself clerk to a merchant, and by some <reg orig="mer-|cantile"
                            >mercantile</reg>
                        <lb/> adventures in which he had successfully engaged, <lb/> began to
                        flatter himself with being able, in no long time, to <lb/> support a family.
                        Meanwhile, a tender and constant <reg orig="cor-|respondence"
                            >correspondence</reg>
                        <lb/> was maintained between him and his beloved <lb/> Susan. This girl was
                        a soft enthusiast, in whose bosom <reg orig="de-|votion">devotion</reg>
                        <lb/> and love glowed with an ardor that has seldom been <lb/> exceeded.</p>
                    <p>The first tidings of the <hi rend="italic">yellow fever,</hi> was heard by
                        her <lb/> with unspeakable perturbation. Wallace was interrogated, <lb/> by
                        letter, respecting its truth. For a time, he treated it as a <lb/> vague
                        report. At length, a confession was extorted from <lb/> him that there
                        existed a pestilential disease in the city, but, <lb/> he added, that it was
                        hitherto confined to one quarter, <reg orig="dis-|tant">distant</reg>
                        <lb/> from the place of his abode.</p>
                    <p>The most pathetic entreaties were urged by her that he <lb/> would withdraw
                        into the country. He declared his <reg orig="resolu-|tion">resolution</reg>
                        <lb/> to comply when the street in which he lived should <reg
                            orig="be-|come">become</reg>
                        <lb/> infected, and his stay should be attended with real <lb/>
                        <pb n="119" entity="eaf033v2_0132" pid="uva-lib:349439"/> danger. He stated
                        how much his interests depended upon <lb/> the favor of his present
                        employer, who had used the most <lb/> powerful arguments to detain him, but
                        declared that, when <lb/> his situation should become, in the least degree,
                        perilous, he <lb/> would slight every consideration of gratitude and
                        interest, <lb/> and fly to <hi rend="italic">Malverton.</hi> Meanwhile, he
                        promised to <reg orig="commu-|nicate">communicate</reg>
                        <lb/> tidings of his safety, by every opportunity.</p>
                    <p>Belding, Mr. Hadwin's next neighbor, though not <reg orig="unin-|fected"
                            >uninfected</reg>
                        <lb/> by the general panic, persisted to visit the city daily <lb/> with his
                            <hi rend="italic">market-cart.</hi> He set out by sunrise, and usually
                        <lb/> returned by noon. By him a letter was punctually <reg
                            orig="re-|ceived">received</reg>
                        <lb/> by Susan. As the hour of Belding's return <reg orig="ap-|proached"
                            >approached</reg>, <lb/> her impatience and anxiety increased. The daily
                        <lb/> epistle was received and read, in a transport of eagerness. <lb/> For
                        a while her emotion subsided, but returned with <reg orig="aug-|mented"
                            >augmented</reg>
                        <lb/> vehemence at noon on the ensuing day.</p>
                    <p>These agitations were too vehement for a feeble <reg orig="constitu-|tion"
                            >constitution</reg>
                        <lb/> like her's. She renewed her supplications to Wallace <lb/> to quit the
                        city. He repeated his assertions of being, <reg orig="hither-|to"
                            >hitherto</reg>, <lb/> secure, and his promise of coming when the danger
                        <lb/> should be imminent. When Belding returned, and, instead <lb/> of being
                        accompanied by Wallace, merely brought a letter <lb/> from him, the unhappy
                        Susan would sink into fits of <reg orig="lamenta-|tion">lamentation</reg>
                        <lb/> and weeping, and repel every effort to console her with <lb/> an
                        obstinacy that partook of madness. It was, at length, <reg orig="man-|ifest"
                            >manifest</reg>, <lb/> that Wallace's delays would be fatally injurious
                        to the <lb/> health of his mistress.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Hadwin had hitherto been passive. He conceived <lb/> that the entreaties
                        and remonstrances of his daughter were <lb/> more likely to influence the
                        conduct of Wallace, than any <lb/> representations which he could make. Now,
                        however, he <lb/> wrote the contumacious Wallace a letter, in which he laid
                        <lb/> his commands upon him to return in company with Belding, <lb/> and
                        declared that by a longer delay, the youth would <reg orig="for-|feit"
                            >forfeit</reg>
                        <lb/> his favor.</p>
                    <p>The malady had, at this time, made considerable progress. <lb/> Belding's
                        interest at length yielded to his fears, and this was <lb/> the last journey
                        which he proposed to make. Hence our <lb/> impatience for the return of
                        Wallace was augmented; since, <lb/> if this opportunity were lost, no
                        suitable conveyance might <lb/> again be offered him.</p>
                    <pb n="120" entity="eaf033v2_0133" pid="uva-lib:349440"/>
                    <p>Belding set out as usual, at the dawn of day. The <reg orig="cus-|tomary"
                            >customary</reg>
                        <lb/> interval between his departure and return, was spent <lb/> by Susan in
                        a tumult of hopes and fears. As noon <reg orig="approach-|ed"
                            >approached</reg>
                        <lb/> her suspense arose to a pitch of wildness and agony. She <lb/> could
                        scarcely be restrained from running along the road, <lb/> many miles,
                        towards the city; that she might, by meeting <lb/> Belding half way, the
                        sooner ascertain the fate of her lover. <lb/> She stationed herself at a
                        window which overlooked the <lb/> road along which Belding was to pass.</p>
                    <p>Her sister, and her father, though less impatient, marked, <lb/> with painful
                        eagerness, the first sound of the approaching <lb/> vehicle. They snatched a
                        look at it as soon as it appeared <lb/> in sight. Belding was without a
                        companion.</p>
                    <p>This confirmation of her fears, overwhelmed the unhappy <lb/> Susan. She sunk
                        into a fit, from which, for a long time, <lb/> her recovery was hopeless.
                        This was succeeded by <reg orig="par-|oxysms">paroxysms</reg>
                        <lb/> of a furious insanity, in which she attempted to <lb/> snatch any
                        pointed implement which lay within her reach, <lb/> with a view to destroy
                        herself. These being carefully <reg orig="re-|moved">removed</reg>, <lb/> or
                        forcibly wrested from her, she resigned herself <lb/> to sobs and
                        exclamations.</p>
                    <p>Having interrogated Belding, he informed us that he <lb/> occupied his usual
                        post in the market-place; that <reg orig="here-|tofore">heretofore</reg>,
                        <lb/> Wallace had duly sought him out, and exchanged <lb/> letters; but
                        that, on this morning, the young man had not <lb/> made his appearance;
                        though Belding had been induced, <lb/> by his wish to see him, to prolong
                        his stay in the city, much <lb/> beyond the usual period.</p>
                    <p>That some other cause than sickness had occasioned this <lb/> omission was
                        barely possible. There was scarcely room for <lb/> the most sanguine temper
                        to indulge a hope. Wallace was <lb/> without kindred, and probably without
                        friends, in the city. <lb/> The merchant in whose service he had placed
                        himself, was <lb/> connected with him by no consideration but that of
                        interest. <lb/> What then must be his situation when seized with a malady
                        <lb/> which all believed to be contagious; and the fear of which, <lb/> was
                        able to dissolve the strongest ties that bind human <reg orig="be-|ings"
                            >beings</reg>
                        <lb/> together?</p>
                    <p>I was personally a stranger to this youth. I had seen his <lb/> letters, and
                        they bespoke, not indeed, any great refinement <lb/> or elevation of
                        intelligence, but a frank and generous spirit, <lb/>
                        <pb n="121" entity="eaf033v2_0134" pid="uva-lib:349441">

                        </pb> to which I could not refuse my esteem; but his chief claim <lb/> to my
                        affection consisted in his consanguinity to Mr. Hadwin, <lb/> and his place
                        in the affections of Susan. His welfare was <lb/> essential to the happiness
                        of those, whose happiness had <lb/> become essential to mine. I witnessed
                        the outrages of <reg orig="de-|spair">despair</reg>
                        <lb/> in the daughter, and the symptoms of a deep, but less <lb/> violent
                        grief, in the sister and parent. Was it not possible <lb/> for me to
                        alleviate their pangs? Could not the fate of <reg orig="Wal-|lace"
                            >Wallace</reg>
                        <lb/> be ascertained?</p>
                    <p>This disease assailed men with different degrees of <reg orig="ma-|lignity"
                            >malignity</reg>. <lb/> In its worst form perhaps it was incurable; but
                        in <lb/> some of its modes, it was doubtless conquerable by the <lb/> skill
                        of physicians, and the fidelity of nurses. In its least <lb/> formidable
                        symptoms, negligence and solitude would render <lb/> it fatal.</p>
                    <p>Wallace might, perhaps, experience this pest in its most <lb/> lenient
                        degree; but the desertion of all mankind; the want, <lb/> not only of
                        medicines, but of food, would irrevocably seal <lb/> his doom. My
                        imagination was incessantly pursued by the <lb/> image of this youth,
                        perishing alone, and in obscurity; <lb/> calling on the name of distant
                        friends, or invoking, <reg orig="ineffect-|ually">ineffectually</reg>, <lb/>
                        the succor of those who were near.</p>
                    <p>Hitherto distress had been contemplated at a distance, <lb/> and through the
                        medium of a fancy delighting to be startled <lb/> by the wonderful, or
                        transported by sublimity. Now the <lb/> calamity had entered my own doors,
                        imaginary evils were <lb/> supplanted by real, and my heart was the seat of
                            <reg orig="commise-|ration">commiseration</reg>
                        <lb/> and horror.</p>
                    <p>I found myself unfit for recreation or employment. I <lb/> shrouded myself in
                        the gloom of the neighboring forest, or <lb/> lost myself in the maze of
                        rocks and dells. I endeavored, <lb/> in vain, to shut out the phantoms of
                        the dying Wallace, and <lb/> to forget the spectacle of domestic woes. At
                        length, it <reg orig="oc-|curred">occurred</reg>
                        <lb/> to me to ask, may not this evil be obviated, and the <lb/> felicity of

                            >friendless</reg>
                        <lb/> and succorless; but cannot I supply to him the place <lb/> of
                        protector and nurse? Why not hasten to the city, search <lb/> out his abode,
                        and ascertain whether he be living or dead? <lb/> If he still retain life,

                        <lb/> him once more to the bosom of his family?</p>
                    <p>With what transports will his arrival be hailed? How <lb/> amply will their
                        impatience and their sorrow be compensated <lb/> by his return! In the
                        spectacle of their joys, how <reg orig="raptu-|rous">rapturous</reg>
                        <lb/> and pure will be my delight! Do the benefits which <lb/> I have
                        received from the Hadwins demand a less <reg orig="retribu-|tion"
                            >retribution</reg>
                        <lb/> than this?</p>
                    <p>It is true, that my own life will be endangered; but my <lb/> danger will be
                        proportioned to the duration of my stay in <lb/> this seat of infection. The
                        death or the flight of Wallace <lb/> may absolve me from the necessity of
                        spending one night in <lb/> the city. The rustics who daily frequent the
                        market are, as <lb/> experience proves, exempt from this disease; in <reg
                            orig="conse-|quence">consequence</reg>, <lb/> perhaps, of limiting their
                        continuance in the city to <lb/> a few hours. May I not, in this respect,
                        conform to their <lb/> example, and enjoy a similar exemption?</p>
                    <p>My stay, however, may be longer than the day. I may <lb/> be condemned to
                        share in the common destiny. What <lb/> then? Life is dependent on a
                        thousand contingences, not <lb/> to be computed or foreseen. The seeds of an
                        early and <reg orig="lin-|gering">lingering</reg>
                        <lb/> death are sown in my constitution. It is in vain to hope <lb/> to
                        escape the malady by which my mother and my brothers <lb/> have died. We are
                        a race, whose existence some inherent <lb/> property has limited to the
                        short space of twenty years. We <lb/> are exposed, in common, with the rest
                        of mankind, to <reg orig="innu-|merable">innumerable</reg>
                        <lb/> casualties; but if these be shunned, we are <reg orig="unal-|terably"
                            >unalterably</reg>
                        <lb/> fated to perish by <hi rend="italic">consumption.</hi> Why then should
                        I <lb/> scruple to lay down my life in the cause of virtue and <reg
                            orig="hu-|manity">humanity</reg>? <lb/> It is better to die, in the
                        consciousness of having <lb/> offered an heroic sacrifice; to die by a
                        speedy stroke, than <lb/> by the perverseness of nature, in ignominious
                        inactivity, and <lb/> lingering agonies.</p>
                    <p>These considerations determined me to hasten to the <lb/> city. To mention my
                        purpose to the Hadwins would be <lb/> useless or pernicious. It would only
                        augment the sum of <lb/> their present anxieties. I should meet with a
                        thousand <reg orig="ob-|stacles">obstacles</reg>
                        <lb/> in the tenderness and terror of Eliza, and in the <lb/> prudent
                        affection of her father. Their arguments I should <lb/> be condemned to
                        hear, but should not be able to confute; <lb/>
                        <pb n="123" entity="eaf033v2_0136" pid="uva-lib:349443"/> and should only
                        load myself with imputations of <reg orig="perverse-|ness"
                            >perverseness</reg>
                        <lb/> and temerity.</p>
                    <p>But how else should I explain my absence? I had <lb/> hitherto preserved my
                        lips untainted by prevarication or <lb/> falsehood. Perhaps there was no
                        occasion which would <lb/> justify an untruth; but here, at least, it was
                        superfluous or <lb/> hurtful. My disappearance, if effected without notice
                        or <lb/> warning, will give birth to speculation and conjecture; but <lb/>
                        my true motives will never be suspected, and therefore will <lb/> excite no
                        fears. My conduct will not be charged with guilt. <lb/> It will merely be
                        thought upon with some regret, which will <lb/> be alleviated by the opinion
                        of my safety, and the daily <lb/> expectation of my return.</p>
                    <p>But, since my purpose was to search out Wallace, I <lb/> must be previously
                        furnished with directions to the place of <lb/> his abode, and a description
                        of his person. Satisfaction on <lb/> this head was easily obtained from Mr.
                        Hadwin; who was <lb/> prevented from suspecting the motives of my curiosity,
                        by <lb/> my questions being put in a manner apparently casual. He <lb/>
                        mentioned the street, and the number of the house.</p>
                    <p>I listened with surprise. It was a house with which I <lb/> was already
                        familiar. He resided, it seems, with a <reg orig="mer-|chant"
                        >merchant</reg>. <lb/> Was it possible for me to be mistaken?</p>
                    <p>What, I asked, was the merchant's name?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Thetford.</hi></p>
                    <p>This was a confirmation of my first conjecture. I <reg orig="re-|collected"
                            >recollected</reg>
                        <lb/> the extraordinary means by which I had gained <lb/> access to the
                        house and bed-chamber of this gentleman. I <lb/> recalled the person and
                        appearance of the youth by whose <lb/> artifices I had been entangled in the
                        snare. These artifices <lb/> implied some domestic or confidential connexion
                        between <lb/> Thetford and my guide. Wallace was a member of the <lb/>
                        family. Could it be he by whom I was betrayed?</p>
                    <p>Suitable questions easily obtained from Hadwin a <reg orig="de-|scription"

                        <lb/> of the person and carriage of his nephew. Every <lb/> circumstance
                        evinced the identity of their persons. <reg orig="Wal-|lace">Wallace</reg>,
                        <lb/> then, was the engaging and sprightly youth whom I <lb/> had
                        encountered at Lesher's; and who, for purposes not <lb/> hitherto
                        discoverable, had led me into a situation so <reg orig="ro-|mantic"
                            >romantic</reg>
                        <lb/> and perilous.</p>
                    <p>I was far from suspecting that these purposes were <reg orig="crimi-|nal"
                            >criminal</reg>. <lb/>
                        <pb n="124" entity="eaf033v2_0137" pid="uva-lib:349444"/> It was easy to
                        infer that his conduct proceeded from <lb/> juvenile wantonness, and a love
                        of sport. My resolution <lb/> was unaltered by this disclosure; and having
                        obtained all <lb/> the information which I needed, I secretly began my <reg
                            orig="jour-|ney">journey</reg>.</p>
                    <p>My reflections, on the way, were sufficiently employed <lb/> in tracing the
                        consequences of my project; in computing <lb/> the inconveniences and
                        dangers to which I was preparing to <lb/> subject myself; in fortifying my
                        courage against the <reg orig="influ-|ence">influence</reg>
                        <lb/> of rueful sights and abrupt transitions; and in <reg

                    <p>Connected as these views were with the family and <reg orig="cha-|racter"
                            >character</reg>
                        <lb/> of Thetford, I could not but sometimes advert to <lb/> those incidents
                        which formerly happened. The mercantile <lb/> alliance between him and
                        Welbeck was remembered; the <lb/> allusions which were made to the condition
                        of the latter in <lb/> the chamber conversation, of which I was an
                        unsuspected <lb/> auditor; and the relation which these allusions might <reg

                        <lb/> with subsequent occurrences. Welbeck's property was <lb/> forfeited.
                        It had been confided to the care of Thetford's <lb/> brother. Had the case
                        of this forfeiture been truly or <lb/> thoroughly explained? Might not
                        contraband articles have <lb/> been admitted through the management, or
                        under the <reg orig="con-|nivance">connivance</reg>
                        <lb/> of the brothers; and might not the younger <reg orig="Thet-|ford"

                        <lb/> be furnished with the means of purchasing the captured <lb/> vessel
                        and her cargo; which, as usual, would be sold by <lb/> auction at a fifth or
                        tenth of its real value?</p>
                    <p>Welbeck was not alive to profit by the detection of this <lb/> artifice,
                        admitting these conclusions to be just. My <reg orig="know-|ledge"
                            >knowledge</reg>
                        <lb/> will be useless to the world; for by what motives can <lb/> I be
                        influenced to publish the truth; or by whom will my <lb/> single testimony
                        be believed, in opposition to that plausible <lb/> exterior, and, perhaps,
                        to that general integrity which <reg orig="Thet-|ford">Thetford</reg>
                        <lb/> has maintained? To myself it will not be unprofitable. <lb/> It is a
                        lesson on the principles of human nature; on the <reg orig="de-|lusiveness"
                            >delusiveness</reg>
                        <lb/> of appearances; on the perviousness of fraud; <lb/> and on the power
                        with which nature has invested human <lb/> beings over the thoughts and
                        actions of each other.</p>
                    <p>Thetford and his frauds were dismissed from my thoughts, <lb/> to give place
                        to considerations relative to Clemenza Lodi, <lb/>

                        had only confirmed my purpose to restore these bills <lb/> to the rightful
                        proprietor, and heightened my impatience to <lb/> discover her retreat. I
                        reflected, that the means of doing <lb/> this were more likely to suggest
                        themselves at the place to <lb/> which I was going than elsewhere. I might,
                        indeed, perish <lb/> before my views, in this respect, could be
                        accomplished. <lb/> Against these evils, I had at present no power to
                        provide. <lb/> While I lived, I would bear perpetually about me the volume
                        <lb/> and its precious contents. If I died, a superior power must <lb/>
                        direct the course of this as of all other events.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="small-caps">These</hi> meditations did not enfeeble my resolution,
                        or <lb/> slacken my pace. In proportion as I drew near the city, the <lb/>
                        tokens of its calamitous condition became more apparent. <lb/> Every
                        farm-house was filled with supernumerary tenants; <lb/> fugitives from home;
                        and haunting the skirts of the road, <lb/> eager to detain every passenger
                        with inquiries after news. <lb/> The passengers were numerous; for the tide
                        of emigration <lb/> was by no means exhausted. Some were on foot, bearing
                        <lb/> in their countenances the tokens of their recent terror, and <lb/>
                        filled with mournful reflections on the forlornness of their <lb/> state.
                        Few had secured to themselves an asylum; some <lb/> were without the means
                        of paying for victuals or lodging for <lb/> the coming night; others, who
                        were not thus destitute, yet <lb/> knew not whither to apply for
                        entertainment, every house <lb/> being already overstocked with inhabitants,
                        or barring its <lb/> inhospitable doors at their approach.</p>
                    <p>Families of weeping mothers, and dismayed children, <lb/> attended with a few
                        pieces of indispensable furniture, were <lb/> carried in vehicles of every
                        form. The parent or husband <lb/> had perished; and the price of some
                        moveable, or the <reg orig="pit-|tance">pittance</reg>
                        <lb/> handed forth by public charity, had been expended <lb/> to purchase
                        the means of retiring from this theatre of <reg orig="disas-|ters"
                            >disasters</reg>; <lb/>
                        <pb n="126" entity="eaf033v2_0139" pid="uva-lib:349446"/> though uncertain
                        and hopeless of accommodation in <lb/> the neighboring districts.</p>
                    <p>Between these and the fugitives whom curiosity had led <lb/> to the road,
                        dialogues frequently took place, to which I was <lb/> suffered to listen.
                        From every mouth the tale of sorrow <lb/> was repeated with new
                        aggravations. Pictures of their own <lb/> distress, or of that of their
                        neighbors, were exhibited in all <lb/> the hues which imagination can annex
                        to pestilence and <lb/> poverty.</p>
                    <p>My preconceptions of the evil now appeared to have <lb/> fallen short of the
                        truth. The dangers into which I was <lb/> rushing, seemed more numerous and
                        imminent than I had <lb/> previously imagined. I wavered not in my purpose.
                        A <lb/> panic crept to my heart, which more vehement exertions <lb/> were
                        necessary to subdue or control; but I harbored not a <lb/> momentary doubt
                        that the course which I had taken was <lb/> prescribed by duty. There was no
                        difficulty or reluctance <lb/> in proceeding. All for which my efforts were
                        demanded, <lb/> was to walk in this path without tumult or alarm.</p>
                    <p>Various circumstances had hindered me from setting out <lb/> upon this
                        journey as early as was proper. My frequent <lb/> pauses to listen to the
                        narratives of travellers, contributed <lb/> likewise to procrastination. The
                        sun had nearly set before <lb/> I reached the precincts of the city. I
                        pursued the track which <lb/> I had formerly taken, and entered High-street
                        after <reg orig="night-|fall">nightfall</reg>. <lb/> Instead of equipages
                        and a throng of passengers, the <lb/> voice of levity and glee, which I had
                        formerly observed, and <lb/> which the mildness of the season would, at
                        other times, have <lb/> produced, I found nothing but a dreary solitude.</p>
                    <p>The market-place, and each side of this magnificent <lb/> avenue were
                        illuminated, as before, by lamps; but between <lb/> the verge of Schuylkill
                        and the heart of the city, I met not <lb/> more than a dozen figures; and
                        these were ghost-like, wrapt <lb/> in cloaks, from behind which they cast
                        upon me glances of <lb/> wonder and suspicion; and, as I approached, changed
                        their <lb/> course, to avoid touching me. Their clothes were <reg
                            orig="sprink-|led">sprinkled</reg>
                        <lb/> with vinegar; and their nostrils defended from contagion <lb/> by some
                        powerful perfume.</p>
                    <p>I cast a look upon the houses, which I recollected to have <lb/> formerly
                        been, at this hour, brilliant with lights, resounding <lb/> with lively
                        voices, and thronged with busy faces. Now they <lb/>
                        <pb n="127" entity="eaf033v2_0140" pid="uva-lib:349447"/> were closed, above
                        and below; dark, and without tokens of <lb/> being inhabited. From the upper
                        windows of some, a gleam <lb/> sometimes fell upon the pavement I was
                        traversing, and <lb/> shewed that their tenants had not fled, but were
                        secluded or <lb/> disabled.</p>
                    <p>These tokens were new, and awakened all my panics. <lb/> Death seemed to
                        hover over this scene, and I dreaded that <lb/> the floating pestilence had
                        already lighted on my frame. I <lb/> had scarcely overcome these tremors,
                        when I approached <lb/> a house, the door of which was opened, and before
                        which <lb/> stood a vehicle, which I presently recognised to be a <hi
                            rend="italic">hearse.</hi></p>
                    <p>The driver was seated on it. I stood till to mark his <lb/> visage, and to
                        observe the course which he proposed to take. <lb/> Presently a coffin,
                        borne by two men, issued from the house. <lb/> The driver was a negro, but
                        his companions were white. <lb/> Their features were marked by ferocious
                        indifference to <lb/> danger or pity. One of them as he assisted in
                        thrusting the <lb/> coffin into the cavity provided for it, said, I'll be
                        damned if <lb/> I think the poor dog was quite dead. It was'nt the <hi
                            rend="italic">fever</hi>
                        <lb/> that ailed him, but the sight of the girl and her mother on <lb/> the
                        floor. I wonder how they all got into that room. What <lb/> carried them
                        there?</p>
                    <p>The other surlily muttered, their legs to be sure.</p>
                    <p>But what should they hug together in one room for?</p>
                    <p>To save us trouble to be sure.</p>
                    <p>And I thank them with all my heart; but damn it, it <lb/> wasn't right to put
                        him in his coffin before the breath was <lb/> fairly gone. I thought the
                        last look he gave me, told me to <lb/> stay a few minutes.</p>
                    <p>Pshaw! He could not live. The sooner dead the better <lb/> for him; as well
                        as for us. Did you mark how he eyed us, <lb/> when we carried away his wife
                        and daughter? I never cried <lb/> in my life, since I was knee-high, but
                        curse me if I ever felt <lb/> in better tune for the business than just
                        then. Hey! <reg orig="con-|tinued">continued</reg>
                        <lb/> he, looking up, and observing me standing a few <lb/> paces distant,
                        and listening to their discourse, What's wanted? <lb/> Any body dead?</p>
                    <p>I stayed not to answer or parley, but hurried forward. My <lb/> joints
                        trembled, and cold drops stood on my forehead. I was <lb/> ashamed of my own
                        infirmity; and by vigorous efforts of <lb/> my reason, regained some degree
                        of composure. The <lb/>
                        <pb n="128" entity="eaf033v2_0141" pid="uva-lib:349448"/> evening had now
                        advanced, and it behoved me to <reg orig="pro-|cure">procure</reg>
                        <lb/> accommodation at some of the inns.</p>
                    <p>These were easily distinguished by their <hi rend="italic">signs,</hi> but
                        many <lb/> were without inhabitants. At length, I lighted upon one, the
                        <lb/> hall of which was open, and the windows lifted. After <lb/> knocking
                        for some time, a young girl appeared, with many <lb/> marks of distress. In
                        answer to my question, she answered <lb/> that both her parents were sick,
                        and that they could <reg orig="re-|ceive">receive</reg>
                        <lb/> no one. I inquired, in vain, for any other tavern at <lb/> which
                        strangers might be accommodated. She knew of <lb/> none such; and left me,
                        on some one's calling to her from <lb/> above, in the midst of my
                        embarrassment. After a <reg orig="mo-|ment's">moment's</reg>
                        <lb/> pause, I returned, discomforted and perplexed, to <lb/> the
                        street.</p>
                    <p>I proceeded, in a considerable degree, at random. At <lb/> length I reached a
                        spacious building in Fourth-street, which <lb/> the sign-post shewed me to
                        be an inn. I knocked loudly <lb/> and often at the door. At length a female
                        opened the <lb/> window of the second story, and in a tone of peevishness
                        <lb/> demanded what I wanted? I told her that I wanted <lb/> lodging.</p>
                    <p>Go hunt for it somewhere else, said she; you'll find none <lb/> here. I began
                        to expostulate; but she shut the window <lb/> with quickness, and left me to
                        my own reflections.</p>
                    <p>I began now to feel some regret at the journey I had <lb/> taken. Never, in
                        the depth of caverns or forests, was I <lb/> equally conscious of
                        loneliness. I was surrounded by the <lb/> habitations of men; but I was
                        destitute of associate or <lb/> friend. I had money, but a horse shelter, or
                        a morsel of <lb/> food, could not be purchased. I came for the purpose of
                        <lb/> relieving others, but stood in the utmost need myself. Even <lb/> in
                        health my condition was helpless and forlorn; but what <lb/> would become of
                        me, should this fatal malady be <reg orig="contract-|ed">contracted</reg>.
                        <lb/> To hope that an asylum would be afforded to a sick <lb/> man, which
                        was denied to one in health, was unreasonable.</p>
                    <p>The first impulse which flowed from these reflections, was <lb/> to hasten
                        back to <hi rend="italic">Malverton;</hi> which, with sufficient <reg
                            orig="dili-|gence">diligence</reg>, <lb/> I might hope to regain before
                        the morning light. I <lb/> could not, methought, return upon my steps with
                        too much <lb/> speed. I was prompted to run, as if the pest was rushing <lb/>
                        <pb n="129" entity="eaf033v2_0142" pid="uva-lib:349449"/> upon me, and could
                        be eluded only by the most precipitate <lb/> flight.</p>
                    <p>This impulse was quickly counteracted by new ideas. I <lb/> thought with
                        indignation and shame on the imbecility of my <lb/> proceeding. I called up
                        the images of Susan Hadwin, and <lb/> of Wallace. I reviewed the motives
                        which had led me to <lb/> the undertaking of this journey. Time had, by no
                        means, <lb/> diminished their force. I had, indeed, nearly arrived at the
                        <lb/> accomplishment of what I had intended. A few steps would <lb/> carry
                        me to Thetford's habitation. This might be the <reg orig="crit-|ical"
                            >critical</reg>
                        <lb/> moment, when succor was most needed, and would be <lb/> most
                        efficacious.</p>
                    <p>I had previously concluded to defer going thither till the <lb/> ensuing
                        morning; but why should I allow myself a moment's <lb/> delay? I might at
                        least gain an external view of the house, <lb/> and circumstances might
                        arise, which would absolve me from <lb/> the obligation of remaining an hour
                        longer in the city. All <lb/> for which I came might be performed; the
                        destiny of <reg orig="Wal-|lace">Wallace</reg>
                        <lb/> be ascertained; and I be once more safe within the <lb/> precincts of
                            <hi rend="italic">Malverton</hi> before the return of day.</p>
                    <p>I immedialy directed my steps towards the habitation of <lb/> Thetford.
                        Carriages bearing the dead were frequently <lb/> discovered. A few
                        passengers likewise occurred, whose <lb/> hasty and perturbed steps, denoted
                        their participation in the <lb/> common distress. The house, of which I was
                        in quest, <lb/> quickly appeared. Light from an upper window indicated <lb/>
                        that it was still inhabited.</p>
                    <p>I paused a moment to reflect in what manner it became <lb/> me to proceed. To
                        ascertain the existence and condition <lb/> of Wallace was the purpose of my
                        journey. He had <reg orig="in-|habited">inhabited</reg>
                        <lb/> this house; and whether he remained in it, was now <lb/> to be known.
                        I felt repugnance to enter, since my safety <lb/> might, by entering, be
                        unawares and uselessly endangered. <lb/> Most of the neighboring houses were
                        apparently deserted. <lb/> In some there were various tokens of people being
                        within. <lb/> Might I not inquire, at one of these, respecting the <reg
                            orig="condi-|tion">condition</reg>
                        <lb/> of Thetford's family? Yet why should I disturb them <lb/> by inquiries
                        so impertinent, at this unseasonable hour? To <lb/> knock at Thetford's
                        door, and put my questions to him who <lb/> should obey the signal, was the
                        obvious method.</p>
                    <p>I knocked dubiously and lightly. No one came. I <lb/>
                        <pb n="130" entity="eaf033v2_0143" pid="uva-lib:349450"/> knocked again, and
                        more loudly; I likewise drew the bell. <lb/> I distinctly heard its distant
                        peals. If any were within, my <lb/> signal could not fail to be noticed. I
                        paused, and listened, <lb/> but neither voice nor footsteps could be heard.
                        The light, <lb/> though obscured by window curtains, which seemed to be
                        <lb/> drawn close, was still perceptible.</p>
                    <p>I ruminated on the causes that might hinder my summons <lb/> from being
                        obeyed. I figured to myself nothing but the <lb/> helplessness of disease,
                        or the insensibility of death. These <lb/> images only urged me to persist
                        in endeavoring to obtain <lb/> admission. Without weighing the consequences
                        of my act, <lb/> I involuntarily lifted the latch. The door yielded to my
                        <lb/> hand, and I put my feet within the passage.</p>
                    <p>Once more I paused. The passage was of considerable <lb/> extent, and at the
                        end of it I perceived light as from a lamp <lb/> or candle. This impelled me
                        to go forward, till I reached <lb/> the foot of a staircase. A candle stood
                        upon the lowest <lb/> step.</p>
                    <p>This was a new proof that the house was not deserted. I <lb/> struck my heel
                        against the floor with some violence; but <lb/> this, like my former
                        signals, was unnoticed. Having <reg orig="pro-|ceeded">proceeded</reg>
                        <lb/> thus far, it would have been absurd to retire with <lb/> my purpose
                        uneffected. Taking the candle in my hand, I <lb/> opened a door that was
                        near. It led into a spacious parlor, <lb/> furnished with profusion and
                        splendor. I walked to and fro, <lb/> gazing at the objects which presented
                        themselves; and <reg orig="in-|volved">involved</reg>
                        <lb/> in perplexity, I knocked with my heel louder than <lb/> ever; but no
                        less ineffectually.</p>
                    <p>Notwithstanding the lights which I had seen, it was <reg orig="pos-|sible"
                            >possible</reg>
                        <lb/> that the house was uninhabited. This I was resolved <lb/> to
                        ascertain, by proceeding to the chamber which I had <reg orig="ob-|served"
                            >observed</reg>, <lb/> from without, to be illuminated. This chamber, as
                        <lb/> far as the comparison of circumstances would permit me to <lb/>
                        decide, I believed to be the same in which I had passed the <lb/> first
                        night of my late abode in the city. Now was I, a <lb/> second time, in
                        almost equal ignorance of my situation, and <lb/> of the consequences which
                        impended, exploring my way to <lb/> the same recess.</p>
                    <p>I mounted the stair. As I approached the door of which <lb/> I was in search,
                        a vapor, infectious and deadly, assailed my <lb/> senses. It resembled
                        nothing of which I had ever before <lb/>
                        <pb n="131" entity="eaf033v2_0144" pid="uva-lib:349451"/> been sensible.
                        Many odors had been met with, even since <lb/> my arrival in the city, less
                        supportable than this. I seemed <lb/> not so much to smell as to taste the
                        element that now <reg orig="en-|compassed">encompassed</reg>
                        <lb/> me. I felt as if I had inhaled a poisonous and <lb/> subtle fluid,
                        whose power instantly bereft my stomach of all <lb/> vigor. Some fatal
                        influence appeared to seize upon my <lb/> vitals; and the work of corrosion
                        and decomposition to be <lb/> busily begun.</p>
                    <p>For a moment, I doubted whether imagination had not <lb/> some share in
                        producing my sensation; but I had not been <lb/> previously panic struck;
                        and even now I attended to my <lb/> own sensations without mental
                        discomposure. That I had <lb/> imbibed this disease was not to be
                        questioned. So far the <lb/> chances in my favor were annihilated. The lot
                        of sickness <lb/> was drawn.</p>
                    <p>Whether my case would be lenient or malignant; whether <lb/> I should recover
                        or perish, was to be left to the decision of <lb/> the future. This
                        incident, instead of appalling me, tended <lb/> rather to invigorate my
                        courage. The danger which I <lb/> feared had come. I might enter with
                        indifference, on this <lb/> theatre of pestilence. I might execute without
                        faltering, the <lb/> duties that my circumstances might create. My state was
                        <lb/> no longer hazardous; and my destiny would be totally <reg
                            orig="unin-|fluenced">uninfluenced</reg>
                        <lb/> by my future conduct.</p>
                    <p>The pang with which I was first seized, and the <reg orig="momen-|tary"
                            >momentary</reg>
                        <lb/> inclination to vomit, which it produced, presently <reg
                            orig="sub-|sided">subsided</reg>. <lb/> My wholesome feelings, indeed,
                        did not revisit me, <lb/> but strength to proceed was restored to me. The
                        effluvia <lb/> became more sensible as I approached the door of the <lb/>
                        chamber. The door was ajar; and the light within was <lb/> perceived. My
                        belief, that those within were dead, was <lb/> presently confuted by a
                        sound, which I first supposed to be <lb/> that of steps moving quickly and
                        timorously across the floor. <lb/> This ceased, and was succeeded by sounds
                        of different, but <lb/> inexplicable import.</p>
                    <p>Having entered the apartment, I saw a candle on the <lb/> hearth. A table was
                        covered with vials and other <reg orig="appara-|tus">apparatus</reg>
                        <lb/> of a sick chamber. A bed stood on one side, the curtain <lb/> of which
                        was dropped at the foot, so as to conceal any one <lb/> within. I fixed my
                        eyes upon this object. There were <lb/> sufficient tokens that some one lay
                        upon the bed. Breath, <lb/>
                        <pb n="132" entity="eaf033v2_0145" pid="uva-lib:349452"/> drawn at long
                        intervals; mutterings scarcely audible; and a <lb/> tremulous motion in the
                        bedstead, were fearful and <reg orig="intelligi-|ble">intelligible</reg>
                        <lb/> indications.</p>
                    <p>If my heart faltered, it must not be supposed that my <lb/> trepidations
                        arose from any selfish considerations. Wallace <lb/> only, the object of my
                        search, was present to my fancy. <lb/> Pervaded with remembrance of the
                        Hadwins; of the agonies <lb/> which they had already endured; of the despair
                        which <lb/> would overwhelm the unhappy Susan, when the death of <lb/> her
                        lover should be ascertained; observant of the lonely <lb/> condition of this
                        house, whence I could only infer that the <lb/> sick had been denied
                        suitable attendance; and reminded by <lb/> the symptoms that appeared, that
                        this being was struggling <lb/> with the agonies of death; a sickness of the
                        heart, more <lb/> insupportable than that which I had just experienced,
                        stole <lb/> upon me.</p>
                    <p>My fancy readily depicted the progress and completion <lb/> of this tragedy.
                        Wallace was the first of the family on <lb/> whom the pestilence had seized.
                        Thetford had fled from <lb/> his habitation. Perhaps, as a father and
                        husband, to shun <lb/> the danger attending his stay, was the injunction of
                        his duty. <lb/> It was questionless the conduct which selfish regards would
                        <lb/> dictate. Wallace was left to perish alone; or, perhaps, <lb/> which
                        indeed was a supposition somewhat justified by <reg orig="ap-|pearances"
                            >appearances</reg>, <lb/> he had been left to the tendence of mercenary

                        abandoned.</p>
                    <p>I was not mindless of the possibility that these <reg orig="forebo-|dings"
                            >forebodings</reg>, <lb/> specious as they were, might be false. The
                        dying <lb/> person might be some other than Wallace. The whispers <lb/> of
                        my hope were, indeed, faint; but they, at least, prompted <lb/> me to snatch
                        a look at the expiring man. For this purpose, <lb/> I advanced and thrust my
                        head within the curtain.</p>

                        </pb> when those features were tremulous and deathful. <lb/> Here, however,
                        the differences were too conspicuous to <lb/> mislead me. I beheld one in
                        whom I could recollect none <lb/> that bore resemblance. Though ghastly and
                        livid, the <lb/> traces of intelligence and beauty were undefaced. The life
                        <lb/> of Wallace was of more value to a feeble individual, but <lb/> surely
                        the being that was stretched before me, and who was <lb/> hastening to his
                        last breath, was precious to thousands.</p>
                    <p>Was he not one in whose place I would willingly have <lb/> died? The offering
                        was too late. His extremities were <lb/> already cold. A vapor, noisome and
                        contagious, hovered <lb/> over him. The flutterings of his pulse had ceased.
                        His <lb/> existence was about to close amidst convulsion and pangs.</p>
                    <p>I withdrew my gaze from this object, and walked to a <lb/> table. I was
                        nearly unconscious of my movements. My <lb/> thoughts were occupied with
                        contemplations of the train of <lb/> horrors and disasters that pursue the
                        race of man. My <lb/> musings were quickly interrupted by the sight of a
                        small <lb/> cabinet, the hinges of which were broken and the lid half <lb/>
                        raised. In the present state of my thoughts, I was prone <lb/> to suspect
                        the worst. Here were traces of pillage. Some <lb/> casual or mercenary
                        attendant, had not only contributed to <lb/> hasten the death of the
                        patient, but had rifled his property <lb/> and fled.</p>
                    <p>This suspicion would, perhaps, have yielded to mature <lb/> reflections, if I
                        had been suffered to reflect. A moment <lb/> scarcely elapsed, when some
                        appearance in the mirror, <lb/> which hung over the table, called my
                        attention. It was a <lb/> human figure, nothing could be briefer than the
                        glance that <lb/> I fixed upon this apparition, yet there was room enough
                        for <lb/> the vague conception to suggest itself, that the dying man <lb/>
                        had started from his bed and was approaching me. This <lb/> belief was, at
                        the same instant, confuted, by the survey of <lb/> his form and garb. One
                        eye, a scar upon his cheek, a <lb/> tawny skin, a form grotesquely
                        misproportioned, brawny as <lb/> Hercules, and habited in livery, composed,
                        as it were, the <lb/> parts of one view.</p>
                    <p>To perceive, to fear, and to confront this apparition were <lb/> blended into
                        one sentiment. I turned towards him with the <lb/> swiftness of lightning,
                        but my speed was useless to my <lb/>
                        <pb n="134" entity="eaf033v2_0147" pid="uva-lib:349454"/> safety. A blow
                        upon my temple was succeeded by an <lb/> utter oblivion of thought and of
                        feeling. I sunk upon the <lb/> floor prostrate and senseless.</p>
                    <p>My insensibility might be mistaken by observers for death, <lb/> yet some
                        part of this interval was haunted by a fearful <lb/> dream. I conceived
                        myself lying on the brink of a pit, <lb/> whose bottom the eye could not
                        reach. My hands and legs <lb/> were fettered, so as to disable me from
                        resisting two grim <lb/> and gigantic figures, who stooped to lift me from
                        the earth. <lb/> Their purpose methought was to cast me into this abyss. My
                        <lb/> terrors were unspeakable, and I struggled with such force, <lb/> that
                        my bonds snapt and I found myself at liberty. At <lb/> this moment my senses
                        returned and I opened my eyes.</p>
                    <p>The memory of recent events was, for a time, effaced by <lb/> my visionary
                        horrors. I was conscious of transition from <lb/> one state of being to
                        another, but my imagination was still <lb/> filled with images of danger.
                        The bottomless gulf and my <lb/> gigantic persecutors were still dreaded. I
                        looked up with <lb/> eagerness. Beside me I discovered three figures, whose
                        <lb/> character or office were explained by a coffin of pine boards <lb/>
                        which lay upon the floor. One stood with hammer and <lb/> nails in his hand,
                        as ready to replace and fasten the lid of <lb/> the coffin, as soon as its
                        burthen should be received.</p>
                    <p>I attempted to rise from the floor, but my head was dizzy <lb/> and my sight
                        confused. Perceiving me revive, one of the <lb/> men, assisted me to regain
                        my feet. The mist and <reg orig="confu-|sion">confusion</reg>
                        <lb/> presently vanished, so as to allow me to stand <reg
                            orig="unsup-|ported">unsupported</reg>
                        <lb/> and to move. I once more gazed at my attendants, <lb/> and recognised
                        the three men, whom I had met in <reg orig="High-|street">High-street</reg>,
                        <lb/> and whose conversation I have mentioned that I <lb/> overheard. I
                        looked again upon the coffin. A wavering <lb/> recollection of the incidents
                        that led me hither and of the <lb/> stunning blow which I had received,
                        occurred to me. I <lb/> saw into what error appearances had misled these
                        men, and <lb/> shuddered to reflect, by what hairbreadth means I had <lb/>
                        escaped being buried alive.</p>
                    <p>Before the men had time to interrogate me, or to <reg orig="com-|ment"
                            >comment</reg>
                        <lb/> upon my situation, one entered the apartment, whose <lb/> habit and
                        mien tended to encourage me. The stranger was <lb/> characterized by an
                        aspect full of composure and benignity, <lb/> a face in which the serious
                        lines of age were blended with <lb/>
                        <pb n="135" entity="eaf033v2_0148" pid="uva-lib:349455"/> the ruddiness and
                        smoothness of youth, and a garb that <lb/> bespoke that religious
                        profession, with whose benevolent <lb/> doctrines the example of Hadwin had
                        rendered me <reg orig="fa-|miliar">familiar</reg>.</p>
                    <p>On observing me on my feet, he betrayed marks of <reg orig="sur-|prise"
                            >surprise</reg>
                        <lb/> and satisfaction. He addressed me in a tone of <lb/> mildness.</p>
                    <p>Young man, said he, what is thy condition? Art thou <lb/> sick? If thou art,
                        thou must consent to receive the best <lb/> treatment which the times will
                        afford. These men will <reg orig="con-|vey">convey</reg>
                        <lb/> thee to the hospital at Bush Hill.</p>
                    <p>The mention of that contagious and abhorred receptacle, <lb/> inspired me
                        with some degree of energy. No, said I, I am <lb/> not sick, a violent blow
                        reduced me to this situation. I <lb/> shall presently recover strength
                        enough to leave this spot, <lb/> without assistance.</p>
                    <p>He looked at me, with an incredulous but compassionate <lb/> air; I fear thou
                        dost deceive thyself or me. The necessity <lb/> of going to the hospital is
                        much to be regretted, but on the <lb/> whole it is best. Perhaps, indeed,
                        thou hast kindred or <lb/> friends who will take care of thee.</p>
                    <p>No, said I; neither kindred nor friends. I am a stranger <lb/> in the city. I
                        do not even know a single being.</p>
                    <p>Alas! returned the stranger with a sigh, thy state is <reg
                            orig="sor-|rowful&mdash;but">sorrowful&mdash;but</reg>
                        <lb/> how camest thou hither? continued he, <reg orig="look-|ing"
                            >looking</reg>
                        <lb/> around him, and whence comest thou?</p>
                    <p>I came from the country. I reached the city a few <lb/> hours ago. I was in
                        search of a friend who lived in this <lb/> house.</p>
                    <p>Thy undertaking was strangely hazardous and rash; but <lb/> who is the friend
                        thou seekest? Was it he who died in <lb/> that bed, and whose corpse has
                        just been removed?</p>
                    <p>The men now betrayed some impatience; and inquired <lb/> of the last comer,
                        whom they called Mr. Estwick, what <lb/> they were to do. He turned to me,
                        and asked if I were <lb/> willing to be conducted to the hospital?</p>
                    <p>I assured him that I was free from disease, and stood <lb/> in no need of
                        assistance; adding, that my feebleness was <lb/> owing to a stunning blow
                        received from a ruffian on my <lb/> temple. The marks of this blow were
                        conspicuous, and <lb/>
                        <pb n="136" entity="eaf033v2_0149" pid="uva-lib:349456"/> after some
                        hesitation he dismissed the men; who, lifting the <lb/> empty coffin on
                        their shoulders, disappeared.</p>
                    <p>He now invited me to descend into the parlor; for, said <lb/> he, the air of
                        this room is deadly. I feel already as if I <lb/> should have reason to
                        repent of having entered it.</p>
                    <p>He now inquired into the cause of those appearances <lb/> which he had
                        witnessed. I explained my situation as clearly <lb/> and succinctly as I was
                        able.</p>
                    <p>After pondering, in silence, on my story;&mdash;I see how <lb/> it is, said
                        he; the person whom thou sawest in the agonies <lb/> of death was a
                        stranger. He was attended by his <reg orig="ser-|vant">servant</reg>
                        <lb/> and a hired nurse. His master's death being certain, <lb/> the nurse
                        was despatched by the servant to procure a coffin. <lb/> He probably chose
                        that opportunity to rifle his master's <lb/> trunk, that stood upon the
                        table. Thy unseasonable <reg orig="en-|trance">entrance</reg>
                        <lb/> interrupted him; and he designed, by the blow <lb/> which he gave
                        thee, to secure his retreat before the arrival <lb/> of a hearse. I know the
                        man, and the apparition thou <lb/> hast so well described, was his. Thou
                        sayest that a friend <lb/> of thine lived in this house&mdash;thou hast come
                        too late to be <lb/> of service. The whole family have perished. Not one was
                        <lb/> suffered to escape.</p>
                    <p>This intelligence was fatal to my hopes. It required some <lb/> efforts to
                        subdue my rising emotions. Compassion not only <lb/> for Wallace, but for
                        Thetford, his father, his wife and his <lb/> child, caused a passionate
                        effusion of tears. I was ashamed <lb/> of this useless and childlike
                        sensibility; and attempted to <lb/> apologize to my companion. The sympathy,
                        however, had <lb/> proved contagious, and the stranger turned away his face
                        to <lb/> hide his own tears.</p>
                    <p>Nay, said he, in answer to my excuses, there is no need <lb/> to be ashamed
                        of thy emotion. Merely to have known this <lb/> family, and to have
                        witnessed their deplorable fate, is <reg orig="suffi-|cient"
                            >sufficient</reg>
                        <lb/> to melt the most obdurate heart. I suspect that thou <lb/> wast united
                        to some one of this family, by ties of tenderness <lb/> like those which led
                        the unfortunate <hi rend="italic">Maravegli</hi> higher.</p>
                    <p>This suggestion was attended, in relation to myself, with <lb/> some degree
                        of obscurity; but my curiosity was somewhat <lb/> excited by the name that
                        he had mentioned. I inquired into <lb/> the character and situation of this
                        person, and particularly <lb/> respecting his connexion with this
                        family.</p>

                    <p>Maravegli, answered he, was the lover of the eldest <lb/> daughter and
                        already betrothed to her. The whole family, <lb/> consisting of helpless
                        females, had placed themselves under <lb/> his peculiar guardianship. Mary
                        Walpole and her children <lb/> enjoyed in him a husband and a father.</p>
                    <p>The name of Walpole, to which I was a stranger, <reg orig="sug-|gested"
                            >suggested</reg>
                        <lb/> doubts which I hastened to communicate. I am in <lb/> search, said I,
                        not of a female friend, though not devoid of <lb/> interest in the welfare
                        of Thetford and his family. My <lb/> principal concern is for a youth, by
                        name, Wallace.</p>
                    <p>He looked at me with surprise. Thetford! this is not his <lb/> abode. He
                        changed his habitation some weeks previous to <lb/> the <hi rend="italic"
                            >fever.</hi> Those who last dwelt under this roof were an <lb/> English
                        woman, and seven daughters.</p>
                    <p>This detection of my error somewhat consoled me. It <lb/> was still possible
                        that Wallace was alive and in safety. I <lb/> eagerly inquired whither
                        Thetford had removed, and whether <lb/> he had any knowledge of his present
                        condition.</p>
                    <p>They had removed to No. &mdash;, in Market street. <reg orig="Con-|cerning"

                        <lb/> their state he knew nothing. His acquaintance with <lb/> Thetford was
                        imperfect. Whether he had left the city or <lb/> had remained, he was wholly
                        uninformed.</p>
                    <p>It became me to ascertain the truth in these respects. I <lb/> was preparing
                        to offer my parting thanks to the person by <lb/> whom I had been so highly
                        benefited; since, as he now <reg orig="in-|formed">informed</reg>
                        <lb/> me, it was by his interposition that I was hindered from <lb/> being
                        enclosed alive in a coffin. He was dubious of my <lb/> true condition, and
                        peremptorily commanded the followers <lb/> of the hearse to desist. A delay
                        of twenty minutes, and <lb/> some medical application, would, he believed,
                        determine <lb/> whether my life was extinguished or suspended. At the <lb/>
                        end of this time, happily, my senses were recovered.</p>
                    <p>Seeing my intention to depart he inquired why, and whither <lb/> I was going?
                        Having heard my answer.&mdash;Thy design, <reg orig="re-|sumed"
                            >resumed</reg>
                        <lb/> he, is highly indiscreet and rash. Nothing will sooner <lb/> generate
                        this fever than fatigue and anxiety. Thou hast <lb/> scarcely recovered from
                        the blow so lately received. Instead <lb/> of being useful to others this
                        precipitation will only disable <lb/> thyself. Instead of roaming the
                        streets and inhaling this <lb/> unwholesome air, thou hadst better betake
                        thyself to bed <lb/>
                        <pb n="138" entity="eaf033v2_0151" pid="uva-lib:349458"/> and try to obtain
                        some sleep. In the morning, thou wilt be <lb/> better qualified to ascertain
                        the fate of thy friend, and afford <lb/> him the relief which he shall
                        want.</p>
                    <p>I could not but admit the reasonableness of these <reg orig="remon-|strances"
                            >remonstrances</reg>, <lb/> but where should a chamber and bed be
                        sought? <lb/> It was not likely that a new attempt to procure <reg
                            orig="accommoda-|tion">accommodation</reg>
                        <lb/> at the inns, would succeed better than the former.</p>
                    <p>Thy state, replied he, is sorrowful. I have no house to <lb/> which I can
                        lead thee. I divide my chamber and even my <lb/> bed with another, and my
                        landlady could not be prevailed <lb/> upon to admit a stranger. What thou
                        wilt do, I know not. <lb/> This house has no one to defend it. It was
                        purchased and <lb/> furnished by the last possessor, but the whole family,
                            <reg orig="includ-|ing">including</reg>
                        <lb/> mistress, children, and servants, were cut off in a single <lb/> week.
                        Perhaps, no one in America can claim the property. <lb/> Meanwhile
                        plunderers are numerous and active. A house <lb/> thus totally deserted, and
                        replenished with valuable furniture <lb/> will, I fear, become their prey.
                        To night nothing can be <lb/> done towards rendering it secure, but staying
                        in it. Art <lb/> thou willing to remain here till the morrow?</p>
                    <p>Every bed in the house has probably sustained a dead <lb/> person. It would
                        not be proper, therefore, to lie in any one <lb/> of them. Perhaps, thou
                        mayest find some repose upon this <lb/> carpet. It is, at least, better than
                        the harder pavement, <lb/> and the open air.</p>
                    <p>This proposal, after some hesitation, I embraced. He <lb/> was preparing to
                        leave me, promising, if life were spared to <lb/> him, to return early in
                        the morning. My curiosity <reg orig="respect-|ing">respecting</reg>
                        <lb/> the person whose dying agonies I had witnessed, <reg orig="prompt-|ed"
                            >prompted</reg>
                        <lb/> me to detain him a few minutes.</p>
                    <p>Ah! said he, this perhaps, is the only one of many victims <lb/> to this
                        pestilence whose loss the remotest generations may <lb/> have reason to
                        deplore. He was the only descendant of an <lb/> illustrious house of Venice.
                        He has been devoted from his <lb/> childhood to the acquisition of knowledge
                        and the practice <lb/> of virtue. He came hither, as an enlightened
                        observer, and <lb/> after traversing the country, conversing with all the
                        men in <lb/> it eminent for their talents or their office; and collecting a
                        <lb/> fund of observations, whose solidity and justice have seldom <lb/>
                        been paralleled, he embarked, three months ago, for Europe.</p>
                    <p>Previously to his departure, he formed a tender connexion <lb/>
                        <pb n="139" entity="eaf033v2_0152" pid="uva-lib:349459"/> with the eldest
                        daughter of this family. The mother and her <lb/> children had recently
                        arrived from England. So many <lb/> faultless women, both mentally and
                        personally considered, it <lb/> was not my fortune to meet with before. This
                        youth well <lb/> deserved to be adopted into this family. He proposed to
                        <lb/> return with the utmost expedition to his native country, and <lb/>
                        after the settlement of his affairs, to hasten back to America, <lb/> and
                        ratify his contract with Fanny Walpole.</p>
                    <p>The ship in which he embarked, had scarcely gone twenty <lb/> leagues to sea,
                        before she was disabled by a storm, and <lb/> obliged to return to port. He
                        posted to New York, to gain <lb/> a passage in a packet shortly to sail.
                        Meanwhile this malady <lb/> prevailed among us. Mary Walpole was hindered by
                        her <lb/> ignorance of the nature of that evil which assailed us, and <lb/>
                        the counsel of injudicious friends, from taking the due <reg
                            orig="pre-|cautions">precautions</reg>
                        <lb/> for her safety. She hesitated to fly till flight was <lb/> rendered
                        impracticable. Her death added to the <reg orig="helpless-|ness"
                            >helplessness</reg>
                        <lb/> and distraction of the family. They were successively <lb/> seized and
                        destroyed by the same pest.</p>
                    <p>Maravegli was apprized of their danger. He allowed the <lb/> packet to depart
                        without him, and hastened to rescue the <lb/> Walpoles from the perils which
                        encompassed them. He <lb/> arrived in this city time enough to witness the
                        interment of <lb/> the last survivor. In the same hour he was seized himself
                        <lb/> by this disease; the catastrophe is known to thee.</p>
                    <p>I will now leave thee to thy repose. Sleep is no less <lb/> needful to myself
                        than to thee; for this is the second night <lb/> which has passed without
                        it. Saying this, my companion <lb/> took his leave.</p>
                    <p>I now enjoyed leisure to review my situation. I <reg orig="experi-|enced"
                            >experienced</reg>
                        <lb/> no inclination to sleep. I lay down for a moment, <lb/> but my
                        comfortless sensations and restless contemplations <lb/> would not permit me
                        to rest. Before I entered this house, I <lb/> was tormented with hunger, but
                        my craving had given place <lb/> to inquietude and loathing. I paced, in
                        thoughtful and <lb/> anxious mood, across the floor of the apartment.</p>
                    <p>I mused upon the incidents related by Estwick, upon the <lb/> exterminating
                        nature of this pestilence, and on the horrors <lb/> of which it was
                        productive. I compared the experience of <lb/> the last hours, with those
                        pictures which my imagination <lb/> had drawn in the retirements of <hi
                            rend="italic">Malverton.</hi> I wondered <lb/>
                        <pb n="140" entity="eaf033v2_0153" pid="uva-lib:349460"/> at the contrariety
                        that exists between the scenes of the <lb/> city and the country; and
                        fostered, with more zeal than <lb/> ever, the resolution to avoid those
                        seats of depravity and <lb/> danger.</p>
                    <p>Concerning my own destiny, however, I entertained to <lb/> doubt. My new
                        sensations assured me that my stomach <lb/> had received this corrosive
                        poison. Whether I should die, <lb/> or live, was easily decided. The
                        sickness which assiduous <lb/> attendance and powerful prescriptions might
                        remove, would, <lb/> by negligence and solitude, be rendered fatal; but from
                        <lb/> whom could I expect medical or friendly treatment?</p>
                    <p>I had indeed a roof over my head. I should not perish <lb/> in the public
                        way; but what was my ground for hoping to <lb/> continue under this roof? My
                        sickness being suspected, I <lb/> should be dragged in a cart to the
                        hospital; where I should, <lb/> indeed, die; but not with the consolation of
                        loneliness and <lb/> silence. Dying groans were the only music, and livid
                        <lb/> corpses were the only spectacle to which I should there be <lb/>
                        introduced.</p>
                    <p>Immured in these dreary meditations, the night passed <lb/> away. The light
                        glancing through the window awakened <lb/> in my bosom a gleam of
                        cheerfulness. Contrary to my <lb/> expectations, my feelings were not more
                        distempered, <reg orig="not-|withstanding">notwithstanding</reg>
                        <lb/> my want of sleep, than on the last evening. <lb/> This was a token
                        that my state was far from being so <reg orig="des-|perate">desperate</reg>
                        <lb/> as I suspected. It was possible, I thought, that this <lb/> was the
                        worst indisposition to which I was liable.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile the coming of Estwick was impatiently <reg orig="ex-|pected"
                            >expected</reg>. <lb/> The sun arose, and the morning advanced, but he
                        <lb/> came not. I remembered that he talked of having reason <lb/> to repent
                        his visit to this house. Perhaps he, likewise, was <lb/> sick, and this was
                        the cause of his delay. This man's <lb/> kindness had even my love. If I had
                        known the way to <lb/> his dwelling, I should have hastened thither, to
                        inquire into <lb/> his condition, and to perform for him every office that
                            <reg orig="hu-|manity">humanity</reg>
                        <lb/> might enjoin; but he had not afforded me any <reg orig="infor-|mation"
                            >information</reg>
                        <lb/> on that head.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="small-caps">It</hi> was now incumbent on me to seek the habitation
                        of <lb/> Thetford. To leave this house accessible to every <reg
                            orig="passen-|ger">passenger</reg>
                        <lb/> appeared to be imprudent. I had no key by which <lb/> I might lock the
                        principal door. I therefore bolted it on <lb/> the inside, and passed
                        through a window, the shutters of <lb/> which I closed, though I could not
                        fasten after me. This <lb/> led me into a spacious court, at the end of
                        which was a <lb/> brick wall, over which I leaped into the street. This was
                        <lb/> the means by which I had formerly escaped from the same <lb/>
                        precincts.</p>
                    <p>The streets, as I passed, were desolate and silent. The <lb/> largest
                        computation made the number of fugitives two thirds <lb/> of the whole
                        people; yet, judging by the universal <reg orig="desola-|tion"
                            >desolation</reg>, <lb/> it seemed as if the solitude were nearly
                        absolute. <lb/> That so many of the houses were closed, I was obliged to
                        <lb/> ascribe to the cessation of traffic, which made the opening <lb/> of
                        their windows useless, and the terror of infection, which <lb/> made the
                        inhabitants seclude themselves from the <reg orig="observa-|tion"
                            >observation</reg>
                        <lb/> of each other.</p>
                    <p>I proceeded to search out the house to which Estwick <lb/> had directed me,
                        as the abode of Thetford. What was my <lb/> consternation when I found it to
                        be the same, at the door of <lb/> which the conversation took place, of
                        which I had been an <lb/> auditor on the last evening.</p>
                    <p>I recalled the scene, of which a rude sketch had been <lb/> given by the <hi
                            rend="italic">hearse-men.</hi> If such were the fate of the <lb/> master
                        of the family, abounding with money and friends, <lb/> what could be hoped
                        for the moneyless and friendless <reg orig="Wal-|lace">Wallace</reg>? <lb/>
                        The house appeared to be vacant and silent, but <lb/> these tokens might
                        deceive. There was little room for <lb/> hope; but certainty was wanting,
                        and might, perhaps, be <lb/> obtained by entering the house. In some of the
                        upper rooms <lb/> a wretched being might be immured; by whom the <reg
                            orig="infor-|mation">information</reg>, <lb/> so earnestly desired,
                        might be imparted, and to <lb/> whom my presence might bring relief, not
                        only from <reg orig="pesti-|lence">pestilence</reg>, <lb/> but famine. For a
                        moment, I forgot my own <reg orig="neces-|sitous">necessitous</reg>
                        <lb/> condition, and reflected not that abstinence had <lb/> already
                        undermined my strength.</p>
                    <pb n="142" entity="eaf033v2_0155" pid="uva-lib:349462"/>
                    <p>I proceeded to knock at the door. That my signal was <lb/> unnoticed,
                        produced no surprise. The door was unlocked, <lb/> and I opened. At this
                        moment my attention was attracted <lb/> by the opening of another door near
                        me. I looked, and <lb/> perceived a man issuing forth from a house at a
                        small <lb/> distance.</p>
                    <p>It now occurred to me, that the information which I <lb/> sought might
                        possibly be gained from one of Thetford's <lb/> neighbors. This person was
                        aged, but seemed to have lost <lb/> neither cheerfulness nor vigor. He had
                        an air of <reg orig="intre-|pidity">intrepidity</reg>
                        <lb/> and calmness. It soon appeared that I was the <lb/> object of his
                        curiosity. He had, probably, marked my <lb/> deportment through some window
                        of his dwelling, and had <lb/> come forth to make inquiries into the motives
                        of my <lb/> conduct.</p>
                    <p>He courteously saluted me. You seem, said he, to be <lb/> in search of some
                        one. If I can afford you the information <lb/> you want, you will be welcome
                        to it.</p>
                    <p>Encouraged by this address, I mentioned the name of <lb/> Thetford; and added
                        my fears that he had not escaped the <lb/> general calamity.</p>
                    <p>It is true, said he. Yesterday himself, his wife, and his <lb/> child were in
                        a hopeless condition. I saw them in the <lb/> evening, and expected not to
                        find them alive this morning. <lb/> As soon as it was light, however, I
                        visited the house again; <lb/> but found it empty. I suppose they must have
                        died, and <lb/> been removed in the night.</p>
                    <p>Though anxious to ascertain the destiny of Wallace, I <lb/> was unwilling to
                        put direct questions. I shuddered, while I <lb/> longed to know the
                        truth.</p>
                    <p>Why, said I, falteringly, did he not seasonably withdraw <lb/> from the city?
                        Surely he had the means of purchasing an <lb/> asylum in the country.</p>
                    <p>I can scarcely tell you, he answered. Some infatuation <lb/> appeared to have
                        seized him. No one was more timorous; <lb/> but he seemed to think himself
                        safe, as long as he avoided <lb/> contact with infected persons. He was
                        likewise, I believe, <lb/> detained by a regard to his interest. His flight
                        would not <lb/> have been more injurious to his affairs, than it was to
                        those <lb/> of others; but gain was, in his eyes, the supreme good. He <lb/>
                        intended ultimately to withdraw; but his escape to-day, <lb/>
                        <pb n="143" entity="eaf033v2_0156" pid="uva-lib:349463"/> gave him new
                        courage to encounter the perils of tomorrow. <lb/> He deferred his departure
                        from day to day, till it ceased to <lb/> be practicable.</p>
                    <p>His family, said I, was numerous. It consisted of more <lb/> than his wife
                        and children. Perhaps these retired in <reg orig="suffi-|cient"
                            >sufficient</reg>
                        <lb/> season.</p>
                    <p>Yes, said he; his father left the house at an early period. <lb/> One or two
                        of the servants likewise forsook him. One girl, <lb/> more faithful and
                        heroic than the rest, resisted the <reg orig="remon-|strances"
                            >remonstrances</reg>
                        <lb/> of her parents and friends, and resolved to adhere <lb/> to him in
                        every fortune. She was anxious that the family <lb/> should fly from danger,
                        and would willingly have fled in <lb/> their company; but while they stayed,
                        it was her <reg orig="immova-|ble">immovable</reg>
                        <lb/> resolution not to abandon them.</p>
                    <p>Alas, poor girl! She knew not of what stuff the heart of <lb/> Thetford was
                        made. Unhappily, she was the first to <reg orig="be-|come">become</reg>
                        <lb/> sick. I question much whether her disease was <lb/> pestilential. It
                        was, probably, a slight indisposition; which, <lb/> in a few days, would
                        have vanished of itself, or have readily <lb/> yielded to suitable
                        treatment.</p>
                    <p>Thetford was transfixed with terror. Instead of <reg orig="summon-|ing"
                            >summoning</reg>
                        <lb/> a physician, to ascertain the nature of her symptoms, he <lb/> called
                        a negro and his cart from Bush-hill. In vain the <lb/> neighbors interceded
                        for this unhappy victim. In vain she <lb/> implored his clemency, and
                        asserted the lightness of her <lb/> indisposition. She besought him to allow
                        her to send to her <lb/> mother, who resided a few miles in the country, who
                        would <lb/> hasten to her succor, and relieve him and his family from <lb/>
                        the danger and trouble of nursing her.</p>
                    <p>The man was lunatic with apprehension. He rejected <lb/> her entreaties,
                        though urged in a manner that would have <lb/> subdued a heart of flint. The
                        girl was innocent, and <reg orig="amia-|ble">amiable</reg>, <lb/> and
                        courageous, but entertained an unconquerable dread <lb/> of the hospital.
                        Finding entreaties ineffectual, she exerted <lb/> all her strength in
                        opposition to the man who lifted her into <lb/> the cart.</p>
                    <p>Finding that her struggles availed nothing, she resigned <lb/> herself to
                        despair. In going to the hospital, she believed <lb/> herself led to certain
                        death, and to the sufferance of every <lb/> evil which the known inhumanity
                        of its attendents could <reg orig="in-|flict">inflict</reg>. <lb/> This
                        state of mind, added to exposure to a noon-day <lb/>
                        <pb n="144" entity="eaf033v2_0157" pid="uva-lib:349464"/> sun, in an open
                        vehicle; moving, for a mile, over a rugged <lb/> pavement, was sufficient to
                        destroy her. I was not <reg orig="sur-|prised">surprised</reg>
                        <lb/> to hear that she died the next day.</p>
                    <p>This proceeding was sufficiently iniquitous; yet it was <lb/> not the worst
                        act of this man. The rank and education <lb/> of the young woman, might be
                        some apology for <reg orig="negli-|gence">negligence</reg>; <lb/> but his
                        clerk, a youth who seemed to enjoy his <reg orig="con-|fidence"
                            >confidence</reg>, <lb/> and to be treated by his family, on the footing
                        of a <lb/> brother or son, fell sick on the next night, and was treated
                        <lb/> in the same manner.</p>
                    <p>These tidings struck me to the heart. A burst of <reg orig="indig-|nation"
                            >indignation</reg>
                        <lb/> and sorrow filled my eyes. I could scarcely stifle <lb/> my emotions
                        sufficiently to ask, of whom, sir, do you speak? <lb/> Was the name of the
                        youth&mdash;his name&mdash;was&mdash;</p>
                    <p>His name was Wallace. I see that you have some <reg orig="in-|terest"
                            >interest</reg>
                        <lb/> in his fate. He was one whom I loved. I would <lb/> have given half my
                        fortune to procure him accommodation <lb/> under some hospitable roof. His
                        attack was violent; but <lb/> still, his recovery, if he had been suitably
                        attended, was <lb/> possible. That he should survive removal to the
                        hospital, <lb/> and the treatment he must receive when there, was not to
                        <lb/> be hoped.</p>
                    <p>The conduct of Thetford was as absurd as it was wicked. <lb/> To imagine this
                        disease to be contagious was the height of <lb/> folly; to suppose himself
                        secure, merely by not permitting a <lb/> sick man to remain under his roof,
                        was no less stupid; but <lb/> Thetford's fears had subverted his
                        understanding. He did <lb/> not listen to arguments or supplications. His
                        attention was <lb/> incapable of straying from one object. To influence him
                        by <lb/> words was equivalent to reasoning with the deaf.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps the wretch was more to be pitied than hated. <lb/> The victims of his
                        implacable caution, could scarcely have <lb/> endured agonies greater than
                        those which his pusillanimity <lb/> inflicted on himself. Whatever be the
                        amount of his guilt, <lb/> the retribution has been adequate. He witnessed
                        the death <lb/> of his wife and child, and last night was the close of his
                        own <lb/> existence. Their sole attendent was a black woman; whom, <lb/> by
                        frequent visits, I endeavored, with little success, to make <lb/> diligent
                        in the performance of her duty.</p>
                    <p>Such, then, was the catastrophe of Wallace. The end <lb/> for which I
                        journeyed hither was accomplished. His destiny <lb/>
                        <pb n="145" entity="eaf033v2_0158" pid="uva-lib:349465">
                            <fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">13</fw>
                        </pb> was ascertained; and all that remained was to fulfil the <lb/> gloomy
                        predictions of the lovely, but unhappy Susan. To <lb/> tell them all the
                        truth, would be needlessly to exasperate <lb/> her sorrow. Time, aided by
                        the tenderness and sympathy <lb/> of friendship, may banish her despair, and
                        relieve her from <lb/> all but the witcheries of melancholy.</p>
                    <p>Having disengaged my mind from these reflections, I <lb/> explained to my
                        companion in general terms, my reasons <lb/> for visiting the city, and my
                        curiosity respecting Thetford. <lb/> He inquired into the particulars of my
                        journey, and the time <lb/> of my arrival. When informed that I had come in
                        the <reg orig="pre-|ceding">preceding</reg>
                        <lb/> evening, and had passed the subsequent hours <reg orig="with-|out"
                            >without</reg>
                        <lb/> sleep or food, he expressed astonishment and <reg orig="compas-|sion"
                            >compassion</reg>.</p>
                    <p>Your undertaking, said he, has certainly been hazardous. <lb/> There is
                        poison in every breath which you draw, but this <lb/> hazard has been
                        greatly increased by abstaining from food <lb/> and sleep. My advice is to
                        hasten back into the country; <lb/> but you must first take some repose and
                        some victuals. If <lb/> you pass Schuylkill before night-fall, it will be
                        sufficient.</p>
                    <p>I mentioned the difficulty of procuring accommodation on <lb/> the road. It
                        would be most prudent to set out upon my <lb/> journey so as to reach <hi
                            rend="italic">Malverton</hi> at night. As to food and <lb/> sleep they
                        were not to be purchased in this city.</p>
                    <p>True, answered my companion, with quickness, they are <lb/> not to be bought,
                        but I will furnish you with as much as you <lb/> desire of both, for
                        nothing. That is my abode, continued <lb/> he, pointing to the house, which
                        he had lately left. I reside <lb/> with a widow lady and her daughter, who
                        took my counsel, <lb/> and fled in due season. I remain to moralize upon the
                        <lb/> scene, with only a faithful black, who makes my bed, <reg
                            orig="pre-|pares">prepares</reg>
                        <lb/> my coffee, and bakes my loaf. If I am sick, all that <lb/> a physician
                        can do, I will do for myself, and all that a nurse <lb/> can perform, I
                        expect to be performed by <hi rend="italic">Austin.</hi></p>
                    <p>Come with me, drink some coffee, rest a while on my <lb/> mattress, and then
                        fly, with my benedictions on your head.</p>
                    <p>These words were accompanied by features <reg orig="disembarras-|sed"
                            >disembarrassed</reg>
                        <lb/> and benevolent. My temper is alive to social impulses, <lb/> and I
                        accepted his invitation, not so much because I wished <lb/> to eat or to
                        sleep, but because I felt reluctance to part so <lb/>
                        <pb n="146" entity="eaf033v2_0159" pid="uva-lib:349466"/> soon with a being,
                        who possessed so much fortitude and <lb/> virtue.</p>
                    <p>He was surrounded by neatness and plenty. Austin added <lb/> dexterity to
                        submissiveness. My companion, whose name <lb/> I now found to be Medlicote,
                        was prone to converse, and <lb/> commented on the state of the city like one
                        whose reading <lb/> had been extensive and experience large. He combated
                        <lb/> an opinion which I had casually formed, respecting the <lb/> origin of
                        this epidemic, and imputed it, not to infected <reg orig="sub-|stances"
                            >substances</reg>
                        <lb/> imported from the east or west, but to a morbid <lb/> constitution of
                        the atmosphere, owing wholly, or in part to <lb/> filthy streets, airless
                        habitations and squalid persons.</p>
                    <p>As I talked with this man, the sense of danger was <reg orig="oblite-|rated"
                            >obliterated</reg>, <lb/> I felt confidence revive in my heart, and
                        energy <reg orig="re-|visit">revisit</reg>
                        <lb/> my stomach. Though far from my wonted health, my <lb/> sensation grew
                        less comfortless, and I found myself to stand <lb/> in no need of
                        repose.</p>
                    <p>Breakfast being finished, my friend pleaded his daily <reg
                            orig="en-|gagements">engagements</reg>
                        <lb/> as reasons for leaving me. He counselled me <lb/> to strive for some
                        repose, but I was conscious of incapacity <lb/> to sleep. I was desirous of
                        escaping, as soon as possible, <lb/> from this tainted atmosphere, and
                        reflected whether any thing <lb/> remained to be done respecting
                        Wallace.</p>
                    <p>It now occurred to me that this youth must have left some <lb/> clothes and
                        papers, and, perhaps, books. The property of <lb/> these was now vested in
                        the Hadwins. I might deem <lb/> myself, without presumption, their
                        representative or agent. <lb/> Might I not take some measures for obtaining
                        possession, or <lb/> at least, for the security of these articles?</p>
                    <p>The house and its furniture was tenantless and <reg orig="unpro-|tected"
                            >unprotected</reg>. <lb/> It was liable to be ransacked and pillaged by
                        those <lb/> desperate ruffians, of whom many were said to be hunting <lb/>
                        for spoil, even at a time like this. If these should overlook <lb/> this
                        dwelling, Thetford's unknown successor or heir might <lb/> appropriate the
                        whole. Numberless accidents might <reg orig="hap-|pen">happen</reg>
                        <lb/> to occasion the destruction or embezzlement of what <lb/> belonged to
                        Wallace, which might be prevented by the <reg orig="con-|duct">conduct</reg>
                        <lb/> which I should now pursue.</p>
                    <p>Immersed in these perplexities, I remained bewildered <lb/> and motionless. I
                        was at length roused by some one <lb/>
                        <pb n="147" entity="eaf033v2_0160" pid="uva-lib:349467"/> knocking at the
                        door. Austin obeyed the signal, and <reg orig="in-|stantly">instantly</reg>
                        <lb/> returned, leading in&mdash;Mr. Hadwin!</p>
                    <p>I know not whether this unlooked for interview excited on <lb/> my part, most
                        grief or surprise. The motive of his coming <lb/> was easily divined. His
                        journey was on two accounts <reg orig="su-|perfluous">superfluous</reg>.
                        <lb/> He whom he sought was dead. The duty of <lb/> ascertaining his
                        condition, I had assigned to myself.</p>
                    <p>I now perceived and deplored the error of which I had <lb/> been guilty, in
                        concealing my intended journey from my <lb/> patron. Ignorant of the part I
                        had acted, he had rushed <lb/> into the jaws of this pest, and endangered a
                        life unspeakably <lb/> valuable to his children and friends. I should
                        doubtless <lb/> have obtained his grateful consent to the project which I
                        had <lb/> conceived; but my wretched policy had led me into this <lb/>
                        clandestine path. Secrecy may seldom be a crime. A <lb/> virtuous intention
                        may produce it; but surely it is always <lb/> erroneous and pernicious.</p>
                    <p>My friend's astonishment at the sight of me, was not <reg orig="in-|ferior"
                            >inferior</reg>
                        <lb/> to my own. The causes which led to this unexpected <lb/> interview
                        were mutually explained. To soothe the agonies <lb/> of his child, he
                        consented to approach the city, and <reg orig="en-|deavor">endeavor</reg>
                        <lb/> to procure intelligence of Wallace. When he left <lb/> his house, he
                        intended to stop in the environs, and hire some <lb/> emissary, whom an
                        ample reward might tempt to enter the <lb/> city, and procure the
                        information which was needed.</p>
                    <p>No one could be prevailed upon to execute so dangerous <lb/> a service.
                        Averse to return without performing his <reg orig="com-|mission"
                            >commission</reg>, <lb/> he concluded to examine for himself. Thetford's
                        <lb/> removal to this street was known to him; but, being ignorant <lb/> of
                        my purpose, he had not mentioned this circumstance to <lb/> me, during our
                        last conversation.</p>
                    <p>I was sensible of the danger which Hadwin had incurred <lb/> by entering the
                        city. Perhaps my knowledge of the <reg orig="inex-|pressible"
                            >inexpressible</reg>
                        <lb/> importance of his life, to the happiness of his <reg
                            orig="daugh-|ters">daughters</reg>, <lb/> made me aggravate his danger.
                        I knew that the longer <lb/> he lingered in this tainted air, the hazard was
                        increased. A <lb/> moment's delay was unnecessary. Neither Wallace nor <lb/>
                        myself were capable of being benefited by his presence.</p>
                    <p>I mentioned the death of his nephew, as a reason for <lb/> hastening his
                        departure. I urged him in the most vehement <lb/> terms to remount his horse
                        and to fly; I endeavored to <reg orig="pre-|clude">preclude</reg>
                        <lb/>
                        <pb n="148" entity="eaf033v2_0161" pid="uva-lib:349468"/> all inquiries
                        respecting myself or Wallace; promising <lb/> to follow him immediately, and
                        answer all his questions at <lb/>
                        <hi rend="italic">Malverton.</hi> My importunities were enforced by his own
                        <lb/> fears, and after a moment's hesitation, he rode away.</p>
                    <p>The emotions produced by this incident, were, in the <reg orig="pre-|sent"
                            >present</reg>
                        <lb/> critical state of my frame, eminently hurtful. My <lb/> morbid
                        indications suddenly returned. I had reason to <reg orig="as-|cribe"
                            >ascribe</reg>
                        <lb/> my condition to my visit to the chamber of Maravegli, <lb/> but this
                        and its consequences, to myself, as well as the <lb/> journey of Hadwin,
                        were the fruits of my unhappy secrecy.</p>
                    <p>I had always been accustomed to perform my journeys on <lb/> foot. This, on
                        ordinary occasions, was the preferable <lb/> method, but now I ought to have
                        adopted the easiest and <lb/> swiftest means. If Hadwin had been acquainted
                        with my <lb/> purpose he would not only have approved, but would have <lb/>
                        allowed me the use of a horse. These reflections were <lb/> rendered less
                        pungent by the recollection that my motives <lb/> were benevolent, and that
                        I had endeavored the benefit of <lb/> others by means, which appeared to me
                        most suitable.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, how was I to proceed? What hindered me <lb/> from pursuing the
                        footsteps of Hadwin with all the <reg orig="expe-|dition">expedition</reg>
                        <lb/> which my uneasiness, of brain and stomach, would <lb/> allow? I
                        conceived that to leave any thing undone, with <lb/> regard to Wallace,
                        would be absurd. His property might <lb/> be put under the care of my new
                        friend. But how was it <lb/> to be distinguished from the property of
                        others? It was, <lb/> probably, contained in trunks, which were designated
                        by <lb/> some label or mark. I was unacquainted with his chamber, <lb/> but,
                        by passing from one to the other, I might finally discover <lb/> it. Some
                        token, directing my footsteps, might occur, <lb/> though at present
                        unforeseen.</p>
                    <p>Actuated by these considerations, I once more entered <lb/> Thetford's
                        habitation. I regretted that I had not procured <lb/> the counsel or
                        attendance of my new friend, but some <reg orig="en-|gagements"
                            >engagements</reg>, <lb/> the nature of which he did not explain, <reg

                        <lb/> him to leave me as soon as breakfast was finished.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="small-caps">I wandered</hi> over this deserted mansion, in a <reg
                            orig="consider-|able">considerable</reg>
                        <lb/> degree, at random. Effluvia of a pestilential nature, <lb/> assailed
                        me from every corner. In the front room of the <lb/> second story, I
                        imagined that I discovered vestiges of that <lb/> catastrophe which the past
                        night had produced. The bed <lb/> appeared as if some one had recently been
                        dragged from it. <lb/> The sheets were tinged with yellow, and with that
                        substance <lb/> which is said to be characteristic of this disease, the
                        <lb/> gangrenous or black vomit. The floor exhibited similar <lb/>
                        stains.</p>
                    <p>There are many, who will regard my conduct as the last <lb/> refinement of
                        temerity, or of heroism. Nothing, indeed, <lb/> more perplexes me than a
                        review of my own conduct. <lb/> Not, indeed, that death is an object always
                        to be dreaded, <lb/> or that my motive did not justify my actions; but of
                        all <lb/> dangers, those allied to pestilence, by being mysterious and <lb/>
                        unseen, are the most formidable. To disarm them of their <lb/> terrors,
                        requires the longest familiarity. Nurses and <reg orig="physi-|cians"
                            >physicians</reg>
                        <lb/> soonest become intrepid or indifferent; but the rest <lb/> of mankind
                        recoil from the scene with unconquerable <lb/> loathing.</p>
                    <p>I was sustained, not by confidence of safety, and a belief <lb/> of exemption
                        from this malady, or by the influence of habit, <lb/> which inures us to all
                        that is detestable or perilous, but by a <lb/> belief that this was as
                        eligible an avenue to death as any <lb/> other; and that life is a trivial
                        sacrifice in the cause of duty.</p>
                    <p>I passed from one room to the other. A portmanteau, <lb/> marked with the
                        initials of Wallace's name, at length <reg orig="at-|tracted"
                            >attracted</reg>
                        <lb/> my notice. From this circumstance I inferred that <lb/> this apartment
                        had been occupied by him. The room was <lb/> neatly arranged, and appeared
                        as if no one had lately used <lb/> it. There were trunks and drawers. That
                        which I have <lb/> mentioned, was the only one that bore marks of Wallace's
                        <lb/> ownership. This I lifted in my arms with a view to remove <lb/> it to
                        Medlicote's house.</p>
                    <p>At that moment, methought I heard a footstep slowly and <lb/>
                        <pb n="150" entity="eaf033v2_0163" pid="uva-lib:349470"/> lingeringly
                        ascending the stair. I was disconcerted at this <lb/> incident. The footstep
                        had in it a ghost-like solemnity and <lb/> tardiness. This phantom vanished
                        in a moment, and yielded <lb/> place to more humble conjectures. A human
                        being <reg orig="ap-|proached">approached</reg>, <lb/> whose office and
                        commission were inscrutable. <lb/> That we were strangers to each other was
                        easily imagined; <lb/> but how would my appearance, in this remote chamber,
                        and <lb/> loaded with another's property, be interpreted? Did he <lb/> enter
                        the house after me, or was he the tenant of some <lb/> chamber hitherto
                        unvisited; whom my entrance had <reg orig="awa-|kened">awakened</reg>
                        <lb/> from his trance and called from his couch?</p>
                    <p>In the confusion of my mind, I still held my burthen <lb/> uplifted. To have
                        placed it on the floor, and encountered <lb/> this visitant, without this
                        equivocal token about me, was <lb/> the obvious proceeding. Indeed, time
                        only could decide <lb/> whether these footsteps tended to this, or to some
                        other <lb/> apartment.</p>
                    <p>My doubts were quickly dispelled. The door opened, <lb/> and a figure glided
                        in. The portmanteau dropped from my <lb/> arms, and my heart's blood was
                        chilled. If an apparition <lb/> of the dead were possible, and that
                        possibility I could not <lb/> deny, this was such an apparition. A hue,
                        yellowish and <lb/> livid; bones, uncovered with flesh; eyes, ghastly,
                        hollow, <lb/> wo-begone, and fixed in an agony of wonder upon me; <lb/> and
                        locks, matted and negligent, constituted the image which <lb/> I now beheld.
                        My belief of somewhat preternatural in <lb/> this appearance, was confirmed
                        by recollection of <reg orig="resem-|blances">resemblances</reg>
                        <lb/> between these features and those of one who was <lb/> dead. In this
                        shape and visage, shadowy and death-like as <lb/> they were, the lineaments
                        of Wallace, of him who had <reg orig="mis-|led">misled</reg>
                        <lb/> my rustic simplicity on my first visit to this city, and <lb/> whose
                        death I had conceived to be incontestably ascertained, <lb/> were forcibly
                        recognised.</p>
                    <p>This recognition, which at first alarmed my superstition, <lb/> speedily led
                        to more rational inferences. Wallace had been <lb/> dragged to the hospital.
                        Nothing was less to be suspected <lb/> than that he would return alive from
                        that hideous receptacle, <lb/> but this was by no means impossible. The
                        figure that stood <lb/> before me, had just risen from the bed of sickness,
                        and <lb/> from the brink of the grave. The crisis of his malady had <lb/>
                        <pb n="151" entity="eaf033v2_0164" pid="uva-lib:349471"/> passed, and he was
                        once more entitled to be ranked among <lb/> the living.</p>
                    <p>This event, and the consequences which my imagination <lb/> connected with
                        it, filled me with the liveliest joy. I thought <lb/> not of his ignorance
                        of the causes of my satisfaction, of the <lb/> doubts to which the
                        circumstances of our interview would <lb/> give birth, respecting the
                        integrity of my purpose. I forgot <lb/> the artifices by which I had
                        formerly been betrayed, and <lb/> the embarrassments which a meeting with
                        the victim of his <lb/> artifices would excite in him; I thought only of the
                            <reg orig="happi-|ness">happiness</reg>
                        <lb/> which his recovery would confer upon his uncle and <lb/> his
                        cousins.</p>
                    <p>I advanced towards him with an air of congratulation, <lb/> and offered him
                        my hand. He shrunk back, and exclaimed <lb/> in a feeble voice, Who are you?
                        What business have you <lb/> here?</p>
                    <p>I am the friend of Wallace, if he will allow me to be so. <lb/> I am a
                        messenger from your uncle and cousins at <hi rend="italic">Malverton.</hi>
                        <lb/> I came to know the cause of your silence, and to afford you <lb/> any
                        assistance in my power.</p>
                    <p>He continued to regard me with an air of suspicion and <lb/> doubt. These I
                        endeavored to remove by explaining the <lb/> motives that led me hither. It
                        was with difficulty that he <lb/> seemed to credit my representations. When
                        thoroughly <lb/> convinced of the truth of my assertions, he inquired with
                        <lb/> great anxiety and tenderness concerning his relations; and <lb/>
                        expressed his hope that they were ignorant of what had <lb/> befallen
                        him.</p>
                    <p>I could not encourage his hopes. I regretted my own <lb/> precipitation in
                        adopting the belief of his death. This <lb/> belief had been uttered with
                        confidence, and without <reg orig="sta-|ting">stating</reg>
                        <lb/> my reasons for embracing it, to Mr. Hadwin. These <lb/> tidings would
                        be borne to his daughters, and their grief <lb/> would be exasperated to a
                        deplorable, and, perhaps, to a <lb/> fatal degree.</p>
                    <p>There was but one method of repairing or eluding this <lb/> mischief.
                        Intelligence ought to be conveyed to them of his <lb/> recovery. But where
                        was the messenger to be found? <lb/> No one's attention could be found
                        disengaged from his own <lb/> concerns. Those who were able or willing to
                        leave the <lb/> city, had sufficient motives for departure, in relation to <lb/>
                        <pb n="152" entity="eaf033v2_0165" pid="uva-lib:349472"/> themselves. If
                        vehicle or horse were procurable for money, <lb/> ought it not to be secured
                        for the use of Wallace himself, <lb/> whose health required the easiest and
                        speediest conveyance <lb/> from this theatre of death?</p>
                    <p>My companion was powerless in mind as in limbs. He <lb/> seemed unable to
                        consult upon the means of escaping from <lb/> the inconveniences by which he
                        was surrounded. As soon <lb/> as sufficient strength was regained, he had
                        left the hospital. <lb/> To repair to <hi rend="italic">Malverton</hi> was
                        the measure which prudence <lb/> obviously dictated; but he was hopeless of
                        effecting it. <lb/> The city was close at hand; this was his usual home; and
                        <lb/> hither his tottering and almost involuntary steps conducted <lb/>
                        him.</p>
                    <p>He listened to my representations and counsels, and <lb/> acknowledged their
                        propriety. He put himself under my <lb/> protection and guidance, and
                        promised to conform implicitly <lb/> to my directions. His strength had
                        sufficed to bring him <lb/> thus far, but was now utterly exhausted. The
                        task of <lb/> searching for a carriage and horse devolved upon me.</p>
                    <p>In effecting this purpose, I was obliged to rely upon my <lb/> own ingenuity
                        and diligence. Wallace, though so long a <lb/> resident in the city, knew
                        not to whom I could apply, or by <lb/> whom carriages were let to hire. My
                        own reflections taught <lb/> me, that this accommodation was most likely to
                        be furnished <lb/> by innkeepers, or that some of those might at least
                        inform <lb/> me of the best measures to be taken. I resolved to set out
                        <lb/> immediately on this search. Meanwhile, Wallace was <reg
                            orig="per-|suaded">persuaded</reg>
                        <lb/> to take refuge in Medlicote's apartments; and to <lb/> make, by the
                        assistance of Austin, the necessary <reg orig="prepara-|tion"
                            >preparation</reg>
                        <lb/> for his journey.</p>
                    <p>The morning had now advanced. The rays of a sultry <lb/> sun had a sickening
                        and enfeebling influence, beyond any <lb/> which I had ever experienced. The
                        drought of unusual <lb/> duration had bereft the air and the earth of every
                        particle <lb/> of moisture. The element which I breathed appeared to <lb/>
                        have stagnated into noxiousness and putrefaction. I was <lb/> astonished at
                        observing the enormous diminution of my <lb/> strength. My brows were heavy,
                        my intellects benumbed, <lb/> my sinews enfeebled, and my sensations
                        universally unquiet.</p>
                    <p>These prognostics were easily interpreted. What I chiefly <lb/> dreaded was,
                        that they would disable me from executing <lb/>
                        <pb n="153" entity="eaf033v2_0166" pid="uva-lib:349473"/> the task which I
                        had undertaken. I summoned up all my <lb/> resolution, and cherished a
                        disdain of yielding to this <reg orig="igno-|ble">ignoble</reg>
                        <lb/> destiny. I reflected that the source of all energy, and <lb/> even of
                        life, is seated in thought; that nothing is arduous <lb/> to human efforts;
                        that the external frame will seldom <reg orig="lan-|guish">languish</reg>,
                        <lb/> while actuated by an unconquerable soul.</p>
                    <p>I fought against my dreary feelings, which pulled me to <lb/> the earth. I
                        quickened my pace, raised my drooping <reg orig="eye-|lids">eyelids</reg>,
                        <lb/> and hummed a cheerful and favorite air. For all that <lb/> I
                        accomplished during this day, I believe myself indebted <lb/> to the
                        strenuousness and ardor of my resolutions.</p>
                    <p>I went from one tavern to another. One was deserted; <lb/> in another the
                        people were sick, and their attendants refused <lb/> to hearken to my
                        inquiries or offers; at a third, their horses <lb/> were engaged. I was
                        determined to prosecute my search <lb/> as long as an inn or a livery stable
                        remained unexamined, <lb/> and my strength would permit.</p>
                    <p>To detail the events of this expedition, the arguments and <lb/>
                        supplications which I used to overcome the dictates of <reg orig="ava-|rice"
                            >avarice</reg>
                        <lb/> and fear, the fluctuation of my hopes and my incessant <lb/>
                        disappointments, would be useless. Having exhausted all <lb/> my expedients
                        ineffectually, I was compelled to turn my <lb/> weary steps once more to
                        Medlicote's lodgings.</p>
                    <p>My meditations were deeply engaged by the present <reg orig="cir-|cumstances"
                            >circumstances</reg>
                        <lb/> of my situation. Since the means which were <lb/> first suggested,
                        were impracticable, I endeavored to <reg orig="investi-|gate"
                            >investigate</reg>
                        <lb/> others. Wallace's debility made it impossible for him <lb/> to perform
                        this journey on foot; but would not his strength <lb/> and his resolution
                        suffice to carry him beyond Schuylkill? <lb/> A carriage or horse, though
                        not to be obtained in the <lb/> city, could, without difficulty, be
                        procured, in the country. <lb/> Every farmer had beasts for burthen and
                        draught. One of <lb/> these might be hired at no immoderate expense, for
                        half a <lb/> day.</p>
                    <p>This project appeared so practicable and so specious, <lb/> that I deeply
                        regretted the time and the efforts which had <lb/> already been so
                        fruitlessly expended. If my project, <reg orig="how-|ever">however</reg>,
                        <lb/> had been mischeivous, to review it with regret, was <lb/> only to
                        prolong and to multiply its mischiefs. I trusted that <lb/> time and
                        strength would not be wanting to the execution of <lb/> this new design.</p>
                    <pb n="154" entity="eaf033v2_0167" pid="uva-lib:349474"/>
                    <p>On entering Medlicote's house, my looks, which, in spite <lb/> of my
                        languors, were sprightly and confident, flattered <reg orig="Wal-|lace"
                            >Wallace</reg>
                        <lb/> with the belief that my exertions had succeeded. When <lb/> acquainted
                        with their failure, he sunk as quickly into <reg orig="hope-|lessness"
                            >hopelessness</reg>. <lb/> My new expedient was heard by him with no
                        <lb/> marks of satisfaction. It was impossible, he said, to move <lb/> from
                        this spot by his own strength. All his powers were <lb/> exhausted by his
                        walk from Bushhill.</p>
                    <p>I endeavored, by arguments and railleries, to revive his <lb/> courage. The
                        pure air of the country would exhilirate him <lb/> into new life. He might
                        stop at every fifty yards, and rest <lb/> upon the green sod. If overtaken
                        by the night, we would <lb/> procure a lodging, by address and importunity;
                        but if every <lb/> door should be shut against us, we should at least, enjoy
                        the <lb/> shelter of some barn, and might diet wholesomely upon the <lb/>
                        new laid eggs that we should find there. The worst <reg orig="treat-|ment"
                            >treatment</reg>
                        <lb/> we could meet with, was better than continuance in <lb/> the city.</p>
                    <p>These remonstrances had some influence, and he at length <lb/> consented to
                        put his ability to the test. First, however, it <lb/> was necessary to
                        invigorate himself by a few hours rest. To <lb/> this, though with infinite
                        reluctance, I consented.</p>
                    <p>This interval allowed him to reflect upon the past, and to <lb/> inquire into
                        the fate of Thetford and his family. The <reg orig="intel-|ligence"
                            >intelligence</reg>, <lb/> which Medlicote had enabled me to afford him,
                        was <lb/> heard with more satisfaction than regret. The ingratitude <lb/>
                        and cruelty with which he had been treated, seemed to have <lb/>
                        extinguished every sentiment, but hatred and vengeance. I <lb/> was willing
                        to profit by this interval to know more of <reg orig="Thet-|ford"
                            >Thetford</reg>, <lb/> than I already possessed. I inquired why Wallace,
                        <lb/> had so perversely neglected the advice of his uncle and <lb/> cousin,
                        and persisted to brave so many dangers when flight <lb/> was so easy.</p>
                    <p>I cannot justify my conduct, answered he. It was in the <lb/> highest degree,
                        thoughtless and perverse. I was confident <lb/> and unconcerned as long as
                        our neighborhood was free from <lb/> disease, and as long as I forbore any
                        communication with <lb/> the sick; yet I should have withdrawn to Malverton,
                        merely <lb/> to gratify my friends, if Thetford had not used the most <lb/>
                        powerful arguments to detain me. He labored to extenuate <lb/> the
                        danger.</p>
                    <pb n="155" entity="eaf033v2_0168" pid="uva-lib:349475"/>
                    <p>Why not stay, said he, as long as I and my family stay? <lb/> Do you think
                        that we would linger here, if the danger were <lb/> imminent. As soon as it
                        becomes so, we will fly. You <lb/> know that we have a country house
                        prepared for our <reg orig="recep-|tion">reception</reg>. <lb/> When we go,
                        you shall accompany us. Your <reg orig="ser-|vices">services</reg>
                        <lb/> at this time are indispensable to my affairs. If you <lb/> will not
                        desert me, your salary next year shall be double; <lb/> and that will enable
                        you to marry your cousin immediately. <lb/> Nothing is more improbable than
                        that any of us should be <lb/> sick, but if this should happen to you, I
                        plight my honor <lb/> that you shall be carefully and faithfully
                        attended.</p>
                    <p>These assurances were solemn and generous. To make <lb/> Susan Hadwin my
                        wife, was the scope of all my wishes <lb/> and labors. By staying I should
                        hasten this desirable event, <lb/> and incur little hazard. By going, I
                        should alienate the <lb/> affections of Thetford; by whom, it is but justice
                        to <reg orig="acknow-|ledge">acknowledge</reg>, <lb/> that I had hitherto
                        been treated with unexampled <lb/> generosity and kindness; and blast all
                        the schemes I had <lb/> formed for rising into wealth.</p>
                    <p>My resolution was by no means steadfast. As often as a <lb/> letter from <hi
                            rend="italic">Malverton</hi> arrived, I felt myself disposed to <lb/>
                        hasten away, but this inclination was combated by new <reg
                            orig="ar-|guments">arguments</reg>
                        <lb/> and new entreaties of Thetford.</p>
                    <p>In this state of suspense, the girl by whom Mrs. <reg orig="Thet-|ford's"
                            >Thetford's</reg>
                        <lb/> infant was nursed, fell sick. She was an excellent <lb/> creature, and
                        merited better treatment than she received. <lb/> Like me, she resisted the
                        persuasions of her friends, but <lb/> her motives for remaining were
                        disinterested and heroic.</p>
                    <p>No sooner did her indisposition appear, than she was <lb/> hurried to the
                        hospital. I saw that no reliance could be <lb/> placed upon the assurances
                        of Thetford. Every <reg orig="considera-|tion">consideration</reg>
                        <lb/> gave way to his fear of death. After the girl's <reg
                            orig="de-|parture">departure</reg>, <lb/> though he knew that she was
                        led by his means to <lb/> execution,&mdash;yet he consoled himself with
                        repeating and <reg orig="be-|lieving">believing</reg>
                        <lb/> her assertions, that her disease was not <hi rend="italic">the
                            fever.</hi></p>
                    <p>I was now greatly alarmed for my own safety. I was <lb/> determined to
                        encounter his anger and repel his persuasions; <lb/> and to depart with the
                        market man, next morning. That <lb/> night, however, I was seized with a
                        violent fever. I knew <lb/> in what manner patients were treated at the
                        hospital, and <lb/> removal thither was to the last degree abhorred.</p>
                    <pb n="156" entity="eaf033v2_0169" pid="uva-lib:349476"/>
                    <p>The morning arrived, and my situation was discovered. <lb/> At the first
                        intimation, Thetford rushed out of the house, <lb/> and refused to re-enter
                        it till I was removed. I knew not <lb/> my fate, till three ruffians made
                        their appearance at my <lb/> bedside, and communicated their commission.</p>
                    <p>I called on the name of Thetford and his wife. I <reg orig="en-|treated"
                            >entreated</reg>
                        <lb/> a moment's delay, till I had seen these persons, and <lb/> endeavored
                        to procure a respite from my sentence. They <lb/> were deaf to my
                        entreaties, and prepared to execute their <lb/> office by force. I was
                        delirious with rage and terror. I <lb/> heaped the bitterest execrations on
                        my murderer; and by <lb/> turns, invoked the compassion, and poured a
                        torrent of <reg orig="re-|proaches">reproaches</reg>
                        <lb/> on, the wretches whom he had selected for his <lb/> ministers. My
                        struggles and outcries were vain.</p>
                    <p>I have no perfect recollection of what passed till my <reg orig="ar-|rival"
                            >arrival</reg>
                        <lb/> at the hospital. My passions combined with my disease, <lb/> to make
                        me frantic and wild. In a state like mine, the <lb/> slightest motion could
                        not be endured without agony. What <lb/> then must I have felt, scorched and
                        dazzled by the sun, <lb/> sustained by hard boards, and borne for miles over
                        a <reg orig="rug-|ged">rugged</reg>
                        <lb/> pavement?</p>
                    <p>I cannot make you comprehend the anguish of my <lb/> feelings. To be
                        disjointed and torn piece-meal by the rack, <lb/> was a torment
                        inexpressibly inferior to this. Nothing <reg orig="ex-|cites">excites</reg>
                        <lb/> my wonder, but that I did not expire before the cart <lb/> had moved
                        three paces.</p>
                    <p>I knew not how, or by whom I was moved from this <lb/> vehicle. Insensibility
                        came at length to my relief. After a <lb/> time I opened my eyes, and slowly
                        gained some knowledge <lb/> of my situation. I lay upon a mattress, whose
                        condition <lb/> proved that a half-decayed corpse had recently been <reg
                            orig="drag-|ged">dragged</reg>
                        <lb/> from it. The room was large, but it was covered with <lb/> beds like
                        my own. Between each, there was scarcely the <lb/> interval of three feet.
                        Each sustained a wretch, whose <lb/> groans and distortions, bespoke the
                        desperateness of his <reg orig="con-|dition">condition</reg>.</p>
                    <p>The atmosphere was loaded by mortal stenches. A <reg orig="va-|por"
                            >vapor</reg>, <lb/> suffocating and malignant, scarcely allowed me to
                        <lb/> breathe. No suitable receptacle was provided for the <reg

                        <lb/> produced by medicine or disease. My nearest <lb/> neighbor was

                        from his stomach.</p>
                    <p>You will scarcely believe that, in this scene of horrors, the <lb/> sound of
                        laughter should be overheard. While the upper <lb/> rooms of this building,
                        are filled with the sick and the dying, <lb/> the lower apartments are the
                        scene of carousals and mirth. <lb/> The wretches who are hired, at enormous
                        wages, to tend <lb/> the sick and convey away the dead, neglect their duty
                        and <lb/> consume the cordials, which are provided for the patients, <lb/>
                        in debauchery and riot.</p>
                    <p>A female visage, bloated with malignity and drunkenness, <lb/> occasionally
                        looked in. Dying eyes were cast upon her, <lb/> invoking the boon, perhaps,
                        of a drop of cold water, or her <lb/> assistance to change a posture which
                        compelled him to <reg orig="be-|hold">behold</reg>
                        <lb/> the ghastly writhings or deathful <hi rend="italic">smile</hi> of his
                        neighbor.</p>
                    <p>The visitant had left the banquet for a moment, only to <lb/> see who was
                        dead. If she entered the room, blinking eyes <lb/> and reeling steps, shewed
                        her to be totally unqualified for <lb/> ministering the aid that was needed.
                        Presently, she <reg orig="dis-|appeared">disappeared</reg>
                        <lb/> and others ascended the staircase, a coffin was <lb/> deposited at the
                        door, the wretch, whose heart still quivered, <lb/> was seized by rude
                        hands, and dragged along the floor into <lb/> the passage.</p>
                    <p>O! how poor are the conceptions which are formed, by <lb/> the fortunate few,
                        of the sufferings to which millions of their <lb/> fellow beings are
                        condemned. This misery was more <lb/> frightful, because it was seen to flow
                        from the depravity of <lb/> the attendants. My own eyes only would make me
                        credit <lb/> the existence of wickedness so enormous. No wonder that <lb/>
                        to die in garrets, and cellars, and stables, unvisited and <reg
                            orig="un-|known">unknown</reg>, <lb/> had, by so many, been preferred to
                        being brought <lb/> hither.</p>
                    <p>A physician cast an eye upon my state. He gave some <lb/> directions to the
                        person who attended him. I did not <reg orig="com-|prehend">comprehend</reg>
                        <lb/> them, they were never executed by the nurses, and <lb/> if the attempt

                        <lb/> to receive what was offered. Recovery was equally <lb/> beyond my
                        expectations and my wishes. The scene which <lb/> was hourly displayed
                        before me, the entrance of the sick, <lb/> most of whom perished in a few
                        hours, and their departure <lb/>
                        <pb n="158" entity="eaf033v2_0171" pid="uva-lib:349478"/> to the graves
                        prepared for them, reminded me of the fate to <lb/> which I, also, was
                        reserved.</p>
                    <p>Three days passed away, in which every hour was <reg orig="ex-|pected"
                            >expected</reg>
                        <lb/> to be the last. That, amidst an atmosphere so <reg orig="con-|tagious"
                            >contagious</reg>
                        <lb/> and deadly, amidst causes of destruction hourly <lb/> accumulating, I
                        should yet survive, appears to me nothing <lb/> less than miraculous. That
                        of so many conducted to this <lb/> house, the only one who passed out of it
                        alive, should be <lb/> myself, almost surpasses my belief.</p>
                    <p>Some inexplicable principle rendered harmless those <reg orig="po-|tent"

                        <lb/> enemies of human life. My fever subsided and <reg orig="van-|ished"

                    <p><hi rend="small-caps">Having</hi> gratified my curiosity in this respect,
                        Wallace <lb/> proceeded to remind me of the circumstances of our first <lb/>
                        interview. He had entertained doubts whether I was the <lb/> person, whom he
                        had met at Lesher's. I acknowledged <lb/> myself to be the same, and
                        inquired, in my turn, into the <lb/> motives of his conduct on that
                        occasion.</p>
                    <p>I confess, said he, with some hesitation, I meant only to <lb/> sport with
                        your simplicity and ignorance. You must not <lb/> imagine, however, that my
                        stratagem was deep laid and <lb/> deliberately executed. My professions at
                        the tavern were <lb/> sincere. I meant not to injure but to serve you. It
                        was <lb/> not till I reached the head of the staircase, that the <reg
                            orig="mis-|chievous">mischievous</reg>
                        <lb/> contrivance occurred. I foresaw nothing, at the <lb/> moment, but
                        ludicrous mistakes and embarrassment. The <lb/> scheme was executed almost
                        at the very moment it <reg orig="oc-|curred">occurred</reg>.</p>
                    <p>After I had returned to the parlor, Thetford charged me <lb/> with the
                        delivery of a message in a distant quarter of the <lb/> city. It was not
                        till I had performed this commission, and <lb/> had set out on my return,
                        that I fully revolved the <reg orig="conse-|quences">consequences</reg>
                        <lb/> likely to flow from my project.</p>
                    <pb n="159" entity="eaf033v2_0172" pid="uva-lib:349479"/>
                    <p>That Thetford and his wife would detect you in their <lb/> bed-chamber was
                        unquestionable. Perhaps, weary of my <lb/> long delay, you would have fairly
                        undressed and gone to <lb/> bed. The married couple would have made
                        preparation to <lb/> follow you, and when the curtain was undrawn, would
                            <reg orig="dis-|cover">discover</reg>
                        <lb/> a robust youth, fast asleep, in their place. These <lb/> images, which
                        had just before excited my laughter, now <lb/> produced a very different
                        emotion. I dreaded some fatal <lb/> catastrophe from the fiery passions of
                        Thetford. In the <lb/> first transports of his fury he might pistol you, or,
                        at least, <lb/> might command you to be dragged to prison.</p>
                    <p>I now heartily repented of my jest and hastened home <lb/> that I might
                        prevent, as far as possible, the evil effects that <lb/> might flow from it.
                        The acknowledgment of my own <lb/> agency in this affair, would at least,
                        transfer Thetford's <reg orig="in-|dignation">indignation</reg>
                        <lb/> to myself to whom it was equitably due.</p>
                    <p>The married couple had retired to their chamber, and no <lb/> alarm or
                        confusion had followed. This was an <reg orig="inexplica-|ble"
                            >inexplicable</reg>
                        <lb/> circumstance. I waited with impatience till the morning <lb/> should
                        furnish a solution of the difficulty. The morning <lb/> arrived. A strange
                        event, had, indeed, taken place in their <lb/> bed-chamber. They found an
                        infant asleep in their bed. <lb/> Thetford had been roused twice in the
                        night, once by a <lb/> noise in the closet, and, afterwards, by a noise at
                        the door.</p>
                    <p>Some connexion between these sounds and the <reg orig="found-|ling"
                            >foundling</reg>, <lb/> was naturally suspected. In the morning the
                        closet <lb/> was examined, and a coarse pair of shoes was found on the <lb/>
                        floor. The chamber door, which Thetford had locked in <lb/> the evening, was
                        discovered to be open, as likewise a <reg orig="win-|dow">window</reg>
                        <lb/> in the kitchen.</p>
                    <p>These appearances were a source of wonder and doubt <lb/> to others, but were
                        perfectly intelligible to me. I rejoiced <lb/> that my stratagem had no more
                        dangerous consequence, <lb/> and admired the ingenuity and perseverance with
                        which you <lb/> had extricated yourself from so critical a state.</p>
                    <p>This narrative was only the verification of my own guesses. <lb/> Its facts
                        were quickly supplanted in my thoughts by the <reg orig="dis-|astrous"
                            >disastrous</reg>
                        <lb/> picture he had drawn of the state of the hospital. I <lb/> was
                        confounded and shocked by the magnitude of this evil. <lb/> The cause of it
                        was obvious. The wretches whom money <lb/> could purchase, were of course,
                        licentious and unprincipled, <lb/>
                        <pb n="160" entity="eaf033v2_0173" pid="uva-lib:349480"/> superintended and
                        controled they might be useful <reg orig="instru-|ments">instruments</reg>,
                        <lb/> but that superintendence could not be bought.</p>
                    <p>What qualities were requisite in the governor of such an <lb/> institution?
                        He must have zeal, diligence, and <reg orig="perseve-|rance"
                            >perseverance</reg>. <lb/> He must act from lofty and pure motives. He
                        <lb/> must be mild and firm, intrepid and compliant. One <reg
                            orig="per-|fectly">perfectly</reg>
                        <lb/> qualified for the office it is desirable, but not possible <lb/> to
                        find. A dispassionate and honest zeal in the cause of <lb/> duty and
                        humanity, may be of eminent utility. Am I not <lb/> endowed with this zeal?
                        Cannot my feeble efforts obviate <lb/> some portion of this evil?</p>
                    <p>No one has hitherto claimed this disgustful and perilious <lb/> situation. My
                        powers and discernment are small, but if <lb/> they be honestly exerted they
                        cannot fail to be somewhat <lb/> beneficial.</p>
                    <p>The impulse, produced by these reflections, was to <reg orig="has-|ten"
                            >hasten</reg>
                        <lb/> to the City-hall, and make known my wishes. This <lb/> impulse was
                        controled by recollections of my own <reg orig="indis-|position"
                            >indisposition</reg>, <lb/> and of the state of Wallace. To deliver this
                        <lb/> youth to his friends was the strongest obligation. When <lb/> this was
                        discharged, I might return to the city, and acquit <lb/> myself of more
                        comprehensive duties.</p>
                    <p>Wallace had now enjoyed a few hours rest, and was <reg orig="per-|suaded"
                            >persuaded</reg>
                        <lb/> to begin the journey. It was now noonday, and the <lb/> sun darted
                        insupportable rays. Wallace was more sensible <lb/> than I of their
                        unwholesome influence. We had not reached <lb/> the suburbs, when his
                        strength was wholly exhausted, and <lb/> had I not supported him, he would
                        have sunk upon the <lb/> pavement.</p>
                    <p>My limbs were scarcely less weak, but my resolutions <lb/> were much more
                        strenuous than his; I made light of his <reg orig="in-|disposition"
                            >indisposition</reg>, <lb/> and endeavored to persuade him that his
                        vigor <lb/> would return in proportion to his distance from the city. <lb/>
                        The moment we should reach a shade, a short respite <lb/> would restore us
                        to health and cheerfulness.</p>
                    <p>Nothing could revive his courage or induce him to go on. <lb/> To return or
                        to proceed was equally impracticable. But, <lb/> should he be able to
                        return, where should he find a retreat! <lb/> The danger of relapse was
                        imminent; his own chamber at <lb/> Thetford's was unoccupied. If he could
                        regain this house, <lb/>

                    <p>His present situation was critical and mournful. To <reg orig="re-|main"

                        Should I not claim the assistance <lb/> of the first passenger that
                        appeared?</p>
                    <p>At that moment a horse and chaise passed us. The <lb/> vehicle proceeded at a
                        quick pace. He that rode in it <lb/> might afford us the succor that we
                        needed. He might be <lb/> persuaded to deviate from his course and convey
                        the <reg orig="help-|less">helpless</reg>
                        <lb/> Wallace to the house we had just left.</p>
                    <p>This thought instantly impelled me forward. Feeble as <lb/> I was, I even ran
                        with speed, in order to overtake the <lb/> vehicle. My purpose was effected
                        with the utmost <reg orig="dif-|ficulty">difficulty</reg>. <lb/> It

                            >indisposed</reg>
                        <lb/> to walk. I want him carried to his lodgings. Will <lb/> you, for money
                        or for charity, allow him a place in your <lb/> chaise, and set him down
                        where I shall direct? Observing <lb/> tokens of hesitation, I continued, you
                        need have no fears <lb/> to perform this office. He is not sick, but merely
                        feeble. <lb/> I will not ask twenty minutes, and you may ask what <reg
                            orig="re-|ward">reward</reg>
                        <lb/> you think proper.</p>
                    <p>Still he hesitated to comply. His business, he said, had <lb/> not led him
                        into the city. He merely passed along the <lb/> skirts of it, whence he
                        conceived that no danger would <lb/> arise. He was desirous of helping the
                        unfortunate, but he <lb/> could not think of risking his own life, in the
                        cause of a <lb/> stranger, when he had a wife and children depending on his
                        <lb/> existence and exertions, for bread. It gave him pain to <lb/> refuse,
                        but he thought his duty to himself and to others <reg orig="re-|quired"
                            >required</reg>
                        <lb/> that he should not hazard his safety by compliance.</p>
                    <p>This plea was irresistible. The mildness of his manner <lb/> shewed, that he
                        might have been overpowered by <reg orig="persua-|sion">persuasion</reg>
                        <lb/> or tempted by reward. I would not take <reg orig="advan-|tage"
                            >advantage</reg>
                        <lb/> of his tractability; but should have declined his <reg
                            orig="assist-|ance">assistance</reg>, <lb/> even if it had been
                        spontaneously offered. I turned <lb/>
                        <pb n="162" entity="eaf033v2_0175" pid="uva-lib:349482"/> away from him in
                        silence, and prepared to return to the <lb/> spot where I had left my
                        friend. The man prepared to <lb/> resume his way.</p>
                    <p>In this perplexity, the thought occurred to me, that, since <lb/> this person
                        was going into the country, he might, possibly, <lb/> consent to carry
                        Wallace along with him. I confided greatly <lb/> in the salutary influence
                        of rural airs. I believed that <lb/> debility constituted the whole of his
                        complaint; that <reg orig="con-|tinuance">continuance</reg>
                        <lb/> in the city might occasion his relapse, or, at least, <lb/>
                        procrastinate his restoration.</p>
                    <p>I once more addressed myself to the traveller, and <reg orig="in-|quired"
                            >inquired</reg>
                        <lb/> in what direction, and how far he was going. To <lb/> my unspeakable
                        satisfaction, his answer informed me, that <lb/> his home lay beyond Mr.
                        Hadwin's, and that this road <reg orig="car-|ried">carried</reg>
                        <lb/> him directly past that gentleman's door. He was <reg orig="will-|ing"
                            >willing</reg>
                        <lb/> to receive Wallace into his chaise, and to leave him at <lb/> his
                        uncle's.</p>
                    <p>This joyous and auspicious occurrence surpassed my <lb/> fondest hopes. I
                        hurried with the pleasing tidings to <reg orig="Wal-|lace">Wallace</reg>,
                        <lb/> who eagerly consented to enter the carriage. I thought <lb/> not at
                        the moment of myself, or how far the same means of <lb/> escaping from my
                        danger might be used. The stranger <lb/> could not be anxious on my account;
                        and Wallace's <reg orig="de-|jection">dejection</reg>
                        <lb/> and weakness may apologize for his not soliciting my <lb/> company, or
                        expressing his fears for my safety. He was <lb/> no sooner seated, than the
                        traveller hurried away. I gazed <lb/> after them, motionless and mute, till
                        the carriage turning a <lb/> corner, passed beyond my sight.</p>
                    <p>I had now leisure to revert to my own condition, and to <lb/> ruminate on
                        that series of abrupt and diversified events that <lb/> had happened, during
                        the few hours which had been passed <lb/> in the city; the end of my coming
                        was thus speedily and <lb/> satisfactorily accomplished. My hopes and fears
                        had rapidly <lb/> fluctuated; but, respecting this young man, had now <reg
                            orig="sub-|sided">subsided</reg>
                        <lb/> into calm and propitious certainty. Before the <reg orig="de-|cline"
                            >decline</reg>
                        <lb/> of the sun, he would enter his paternal roof, and <lb/> diffuse
                        ineffable joy throughout that peaceful and chaste <lb/> asylum.</p>
                    <p>This contemplation, though rapturous and soothing <reg orig="speed-|ily"
                            >speedily</reg>
                        <lb/> gave way to reflections on the conduct which my duty <lb/> required,
                        and the safe departure of Wallace, afforded me <lb/>
                        <pb n="163" entity="eaf033v2_0176" pid="uva-lib:349483"/> liberty to pursue.
                        To offer myself as a superintendent of <lb/> the hospital was still my
                        purpose. The languors of my <lb/> frame might terminate in sickness, but
                        this event it was <reg orig="use-|less">useless</reg>
                        <lb/> to anticipate. The lofty scite and pure airs of Bush-hill <lb/> might
                        tend to dissipate my languors and restore me to <lb/> health. At least,
                        while I had power, I was bound to exert <lb/> it to the wisest purposes. I
                        resolved to seek the City-hall <lb/> immediately, and, for that end, crossed
                        the intermediate <lb/> fields which separated Sassafras from
                        Chesnut-street.</p>
                    <p>More urgent considerations had diverted my attention from <lb/> the money
                        which I bore about me, and from the image of the <lb/> desolate lady to whom
                        it belonged. My intentions, with <lb/> regard to her, were the same as ever;
                        but now it occurred <lb/> to me, with new force, that my death might
                        preclude an <reg orig="in-|terview">interview</reg>
                        <lb/> between us, and that it was prudent to dispose, in <lb/> some useful
                        way, of the money which would otherwise be <lb/> left to the sport of
                        chance.</p>
                    <p>The evils which had befallen this city were obvious and <lb/> enormous.
                        Hunger and negligence had exasperated the <lb/> malignity and facilitated
                        the progress of the pestilence. <lb/> Could this money be more usefully
                        employed than in <reg orig="allevi-|ating">alleviating</reg>
                        <lb/> these evils? During my life, I had no power over it, <lb/> but my
                        death would justify me in prescribing the course <lb/> which it should
                        take.</p>
                    <p>How was this course to be pointed out? How might I <lb/> place it, so that I
                        should effect my intentions without <reg orig="relin-|quishing"
                            >relinquishing</reg>
                        <lb/> the possession during my life.</p>
                    <p>These thoughts were superseded by a tide of new <reg orig="sensa-|tions"
                            >sensations</reg>. <lb/> The weight that incommoded my brows and my
                        <lb/> stomach was suddenly increased. My brain was usurped by <lb/> some
                        benumbing power, and my limbs refused to support <lb/> me. My pulsations
                        were quickened, and the prevalence <lb/> of fever could no longer be
                        doubted.</p>
                    <p>Till now, I had entertained a faint hope, that my <reg orig="indispo-|sition"
                            >indisposition</reg>
                        <lb/> would vanish of itself. This hope was at an end. The <lb/> grave was
                        before me, and my projects of curiosity or <reg orig="benevo-|lence"
                            >benevolence</reg>
                        <lb/> were to sink into oblivion. I was not bereaved of the <lb/> powers of
                        reflection. The consequences of lying in the road, <lb/> friendless and
                        unprotected, were sure. The first passenger <lb/> would notice me, and
                        hasten to summon one of those <reg orig="car-|riages">carriages</reg>
                        <lb/>
                        <pb n="164" entity="eaf033v2_0177" pid="uva-lib:349484"/> which are busy
                        night and day, in transporting its <reg orig="vic-|tims">victims</reg>
                        <lb/> to the hospital.</p>
                    <p>This fate was, beyond all others, abhorrent to my <reg orig="imagi-|nation"
                            >imagination</reg>. <lb/> To hide me under some roof, where my existence
                        <lb/> would be unknown and unsuspected, and where I might <lb/> perish
                        unmolested and in quiet, was my present wish. <reg orig="Thet-|ford's"
                            >Thetford's</reg>
                        <lb/> or Medlicote's might afford me such an asylum, if it <lb/> were
                        possible to reach it.</p>
                    <p>I made the most strenuous exertions; but they could not <lb/> carry me
                        forward more than a hundred paces. Here I <lb/> rested on steps, which, on
                        looking up, I perceived to <reg orig="be-|long">belong</reg>
                        <lb/> to Welbeck's house.</p>
                    <p>This incident was unexpected. It led my reflections into <lb/> a new train.
                        To go farther, in the present condition of my <lb/> frame, was impossible. I
                        was well acquainted with this <lb/> dwelling. All its avenues were closed.
                        Whether it had <lb/> remained unoccupied since my flight from it, I could
                        not <lb/> decide. It was evident that, at present, it was without <reg
                            orig="in-|habitants">inhabitants</reg>. <lb/> Possibly it might have
                        continued in the same <lb/> condition in which Welbeck had left it. Beds or
                        sofas <lb/> might be found, on which a sick man might rest, and be <lb/>
                        fearless of intrusion.</p>
                    <p>This inference was quickly overturned by the obvious <reg
                            orig="sup-|position">supposition</reg>, <lb/> that every avenue was
                        bolted and locked. This, <lb/> however, might not be the condition of the
                        bath-house, in <lb/> which there was nothing that required to be guarded
                        with <lb/> unusual precautions. I was suffocated by inward, and <reg
                            orig="scorch-|ed">scorched</reg>
                        <lb/> by external heat; and the relief of bathing and drinking, <lb/>
                        appeared inestimable.</p>
                    <p>The value of this prize, in addition to my desire to avoid <lb/> the
                        observation of passengers, made me exert all my <reg orig="rem-|nant"
                            >remnant</reg>
                        <lb/> of strength. Repeated efforts at length enabled me to <lb/> mount the
                        wall; and placed me, as I imagined, in security. <lb/> I swallowed large
                        draughts of water as soon as I could reach <lb/> the well.</p>
                    <p>The effect was, for a time, salutary and delicious. My <lb/> fervors were
                        abated, and my faculties relieved from the <lb/> weight which had lately
                        oppressed them. My present <reg orig="con-|dition">condition</reg>
                        <lb/> was unspeakably more advantageous than the former. <lb/> I did not
                        believe that it could be improved, till, casting my <lb/>
                        <pb n="165" entity="eaf033v2_0178" pid="uva-lib:349485"/> eye vaguely over
                        the building, I happened to observe the <lb/> shutters of a lower window
                        partly opened.</p>
                    <p>Whether this was occasioned by design or by accident <lb/> there was no means
                        of deciding. Perhaps, in the <reg orig="precipita-|tion">precipitation</reg>
                        <lb/> of the latest possessor, this window had been <reg orig="overlook-|ed"
                            >overlooked</reg>. <lb/> Perhaps it had been unclosed by violence, and
                        afforded <lb/> entrance to a robber. By what means soever it had <reg
                            orig="hap-|pened">happened</reg>, <lb/> it undoubtedly afforded ingress
                        to me. I felt no <lb/> scruple in profiting by this circumstance. My
                        purposes, <lb/> were not dishonest. I should not injure or purloin any
                        thing. <lb/> It was laudable to seek a refuge from the well-meant <reg
                            orig="perse-|cutions">persecutions</reg>
                        <lb/> of those who governed the city. All I sought was <lb/> the privilege
                        of dying alone.</p>
                    <p>Having gotten in at the window, I could not but remark <lb/> that the
                        furniture and its arrangements had undergone no <lb/> alteration in my
                        absence. I moved softly from one <reg orig="apart-|ment">apartment</reg>
                        <lb/> to another, till at length I entered that which had <reg
                            orig="for-|merly">formerly</reg>
                        <lb/> been Welbeck's bed-chamber.</p>
                    <p>The bed was naked of covering. The cabinets and <reg orig="clos-|ets"
                            >closets</reg>
                        <lb/> exhibited their fastenings broken. Their contents were <lb/> gone.
                        Whether these appearances had been produced by <lb/> midnight robbers or by
                        the ministers of law, and the rage of <lb/> the creditors of Welbeck, was a
                        topic of fruitless conjecture.</p>
                    <p>My design was now effected. This chamber should be <lb/> the scene of my
                        disease and my refuge from the charitable <lb/> cruelty of my neighbors. My
                        new sensations, conjured up <lb/> the hope that my indisposition might prove
                        a temporary <lb/> evil. Instead of pestilential or malignant fever it might
                        be <lb/> a harmless intermittent. Time would ascertain its true <lb/>
                        nature, meanwhile I would turn the carpet into a coverlet, <lb/> supply my
                        pitcher with water, and administer without <lb/> sparing, and without fear,
                        that remedy which was placed <lb/> within my reach.</p>

                        reflecting on the conduct <lb/>
                        <pb n="166" entity="eaf033v2_0179" pid="uva-lib:349486"/> which I ought to
                        pursue, with regard to the bank-bills. I <lb/> weighed with scrupulous
                        attention, every circumstance that <lb/> might influence my decision. I
                        could not conceive any <lb/> more beneficial application of this property,
                        than to the <reg orig="ser-|vice">service</reg>
                        <lb/> of the indigent, at this season of multiplied distress, but <lb/> I
                        considered that if my death were unknown, the house <lb/> would not be
                        opened or examined till the pestilence had <lb/> ceased, and the benefits of
                        this application would thus be <lb/> partly or wholly precluded.</p>
                    <p>This season of disease, however, would give place to a <lb/> season of
                        scarcity. The number and wants of the poor, <lb/> during the ensuing winter,
                        would be deplorably aggravated. <lb/> What multitudes might be rescued from
                        famine and <reg orig="naked-|ness">nakedness</reg>
                        <lb/> by the judicious application of this sum?</p>
                    <p>But how should I secure this application? To enclose the <lb/> bills in a
                        letter, directed to some eminent citizen or public <lb/> officer, was the
                        obvious proceeding. Both of these <reg orig="condi-|tions">conditions</reg>
                        <lb/> were fulfilled in the person of the present chief <reg
                            orig="ma-|gistrate">magistrate</reg>. <lb/> To him, therefore, the
                        packet was to be sent.</p>
                    <p>Paper and the implements of writing were necessary for <lb/> this end. Would
                        they be found, I asked, in the upper <lb/> room? If that apartment, like the
                        rest which I had seen, <lb/> and its furniture had remained untouched, my
                        task would be <lb/> practicable, but if the means of writing were not to be
                            <reg orig="imme-|diately">immediately</reg>
                        <lb/> procured, my purpose, momentous and dear as it <lb/> was, must be
                        relinquished.</p>
                    <p>The truth, in this respect, was easily, and ought <reg orig="imme-|diately"
                            >immediately</reg>
                        <lb/> to be ascertained. I rose from the bed which I had <lb/> lately taken,
                        and proceeded to the <hi rend="italic">study.</hi> The entries and <lb/>
                        staircases were illuminated by a pretty strong twilight. The <lb/> rooms, in
                        consequence of every ray being excluded by the <lb/> closed shutters, were
                        nearly as dark as if it had been <reg orig="mid-|night">midnight</reg>.
                        <lb/> The rooms into which I had already passed, were <lb/> locked, but its
                        key was in each lock. I flattered myself <lb/> that the entrance into the
                            <hi rend="italic">study</hi> would be found in the same <lb/> condition.
                        The door was shut but no key was to be seen. <lb/> My hopes were
                        considerably damped by this appearance, <lb/> but I conceived it to be still
                        possible to enter, since, by <lb/> chance or by design, the door might be
                        unlocked.</p>
                    <p>My fingers touched the lock, when a sound was heard as <lb/>
                        <pb n="167" entity="eaf033v2_0180" pid="uva-lib:349487"/> if a bolt,
                        appending to the door on the inside, had been <lb/> drawn. I was startled by
                        this incident. It betokened that <lb/> the room was already occupied by some
                        other, who desired <lb/> to exclude a visitor. The unbarred shutter below
                        was <reg orig="re-|membered">remembered</reg>, <lb/> and associated itself
                        with this circumstance. <lb/> That this house should be entered by the same
                        avenue, at <lb/> the same time, and this room should be sought, by two <reg
                            orig="per-|sons">persons</reg>
                        <lb/> was a mysterious concurrence.</p>
                    <p>I began to question whether I had heard distinctly. <reg orig="Num-|berless"
                            >Numberless</reg>
                        <lb/> inexplicable noises are apt to assail the ear in an <lb/> empty
                        dwelling. The very echoes of our steps are <reg orig="unwont-|ed"
                            >unwonted</reg>
                        <lb/> and new. This perhaps was some such sound. <reg orig="Re-|suming"
                            >Resuming</reg>
                        <lb/> courage, I once more applied to the lock. The <lb/> door, in spite of
                        my repeated efforts, would not open.</p>
                    <p>My design was too momentous to be readily relinquished. <lb/> My curiosity
                        and my fears likewise were awakened. The <lb/> marks of violence, which I
                        had seen on the closets and <reg orig="cabi-|nets">cabinets</reg>
                        <lb/> below, seemed to indicate the presence of plunderers. <lb/> Here was
                        one who labored for seclusion and concealment.</p>
                    <p>The pillage was not made upon my property. My <reg orig="weak-|ness"
                            >weakness</reg>
                        <lb/> would disable me from encountering or mastering a <lb/> man of
                        violence. To solicit admission into this room would <lb/> be useless. To
                        attempt to force my way would be absurd. <lb/> These reflections prompted me
                        to withdraw from the door, <lb/> but the uncertainty of the conclusions I
                        had drawn, and the <lb/> importance of gaining access to this apartment,
                        combined to <lb/> check my steps.</p>
                    <p>Perplexed as to the means I should employ, I once more <lb/> tried the lock.
                        This attempt was fruitless as the former. <lb/> Though hopeless of any
                        information to be gained by that <lb/> means, I put my eye to the key-hole.
                        I discovered a light <lb/> different from what was usually met with at this
                        hour. It <lb/> was not the twilight which the sun, imperfectly excluded,
                        <lb/> produces, but gleams, as from a lamp; yet its gleams were <lb/>
                        fainter and obscurer than a lamp generally imparts.</p>
                    <p>Was this a confirmation of my first conjecture? <reg orig="Lamp-|light"
                            >Lamplight</reg>
                        <lb/> at noon-day, in a mansion thus deserted, and in a room <lb/> which had
                        been the scene of memorable and disastrous <lb/> events, was ominous.
                        Hitherto no direct proof had been <lb/> given of the presence of a human
                        being. How to <reg orig="ascer-|tain">ascertain</reg>
                        <lb/>
                        <pb n="168" entity="eaf033v2_0181" pid="uva-lib:349488"/> his presence, or
                        whether it were eligible by any means, <lb/> to ascertain it, were points on
                        which I had not deliberated.</p>
                    <p>I had no power to deliberate. My curiosity, impelled me <lb/> to
                        call&mdash;"Is there any one within? Speak."</p>
                    <p>These words were scarcely uttered, when some one <reg orig="ex-|claimed"
                            >exclaimed</reg>, <lb/> in a voice, vehement but
                        half-smothered&mdash;Good <lb/> God!&mdash;</p>
                    <p>A deep pause succeeded. I waited for an answer; for <lb/> somewhat to which
                        this emphatic invocation might be a <reg orig="pre-|lude">prelude</reg>.
                        <lb/> Whether the tones were expressive of surprise or <lb/> pain, or grief,
                        was, for a moment dubious. Perhaps the <lb/> motives which led me to this
                        house, suggested the suspicion, <lb/> which, presently succeeded to my
                        doubts, that the person <lb/> within was disabled by sickness. The
                        circumstances of my <lb/> own condition took away the improbability from
                        this belief. <lb/> Why might not another be induced like me to hide himself
                        <lb/> in this desolate retreat? Might not a servant, left to take <lb/> care
                        of the house, a measure usually adopted by the opulent <lb/> at this time,
                        he seized by the reigning malady? <reg orig="Incapaci-|tated"
                            >Incapacitated</reg>
                        <lb/> for exertion, or fearing to be dragged to the hospital, <lb/> he has
                        shut himself in this apartment. The robber, it may <lb/> be, who came to
                        pillage, was overtaken and detained by <reg orig="dis-|ease">disease</reg>.
                        <lb/> In either case, detection or intrusion would be <reg orig="hate-|ful"
                            >hateful</reg>, <lb/> and would be assiduously eluded.</p>
                    <p>These thoughts had no tendency to weaken or divert my <lb/> efforts to obtain
                        access to this room. The person was a <lb/> brother in calamity, whom it was
                        my duty to succor and <lb/> cherish to the utmost of my power. Once more I
                        spoke:&mdash;</p>
                    <p>Who is within? I beseech you answer me. Whatever <lb/> you be, I desire to do
                        you good and not injury. Open the <lb/> door and let me know your condition.
                        I will try to be of <lb/> use to you.</p>
                    <p>I was answered by a deep groan, and by a sob <reg orig="counter-|acted"
                            >counteracted</reg>
                        <lb/> and devoured as it were by a mighty effort. This <lb/> token of
                        distress thrilled to my heart. My terrors wholly <lb/> disappeared, and gave
                        place to unlimited compassion. I <lb/> again entreated to be admitted,
                        promising all the succor or <lb/> consolation which my situation allowed me
                        to afford.</p>
                    <p>Answers were made in tones of anger and impatience, <lb/> blended with those
                        of grief&mdash;I want no succor&mdash;vex me <lb/> not with your entreaties
                        and offers. Fly from this spot; <lb/>

                    <p>These, I considered merely as the effusions of delirium, <lb/> or the
                        dictates of despair. The style and articulation <reg orig="de-|noted"
                            >denoted</reg>
                        <lb/> the speaker to be superior to the class of servants. <lb/> Hence my
                        anxiety to see and to aid him was increased. <lb/> My remonstances were
                        sternly and pertinaciously repelled. <lb/> For a time, incoherent and
                        impassioned exclamations flowed <lb/> from him. At length, I was only
                        permitted to hear strong <lb/> aspirations and sobs, more eloquent and more
                        indicative of <lb/> grief than any language.</p>
                    <p>This deportment filled me with no less wonder than <reg

                    <p>My perseverance seemed now to have exhausted all his <lb/> patience, and he
                        exclaimed, in a voice of thunder&mdash;Arthur <lb/> Mervyn! Begone. Linger
                        but a moment and my rage, <lb/> tgyer-like, will rush upon you and rend you
                        limb from limb.</p>
                    <p>This address petrified me. The voice that uttered this <lb/> sanguinary
                        menace, was strange to my ears. It suggested <lb/> no suspicion of ever
                        having heard it before. Yet my accents <lb/> had betrayed me to him. He was
                        familiar with my name. <lb/> Nothwithstanding the improbability of my
                        entrance into this <lb/> dwelling, I was clearly recognised and
                        unhesitatingly named!</p>
                    <p>My curiosity and compassion were in no wise diminished, <lb/> but I found
                        myself compelled to give up my purpose. I <lb/> withdrew reluctantly from
                        the door, and once more threw <lb/> myself upon my bed. Nothing was more
                        necessary in the <lb/> present condition of my frame, than sleep; and sleep
                        had, <lb/> perhaps, been possible, if the scene around me had been <lb/>
                        less pregnant with causes of wonder and panic.</p>
                    <p>Once more I tasked memory in order to discover, in the <lb/> persons with
                        whom I had hitherto conversed, some <reg orig="resem-|blance"
                            >resemblance</reg>
                        <lb/> in voice or tones, to him whom I had just heard. <lb/> This process
                        was effectual. Gradually my imagination <reg orig="call-|ed">called</reg>
                        <lb/> up an image, which now, that it was clearly seen, I was <lb/>
                        astonished had not instantly occurred. Three years ago, a <lb/> man, by name
                        Colvill, came on foot, and with a knapsack <lb/>
                        <pb n="170" entity="eaf033v2_0183" pid="uva-lib:349490"/> on his back, into
                        the district where my father resided. He <lb/> had learning and genius, and
                        readily obtained the station for <lb/> which only he deemed himself
                        qualified; that of a <reg orig="school-|master">schoolmaster</reg>.</p>
                    <p>His demeanor was gentle and modest; his habits, as to <lb/> sleep, food, and
                        exercise, abstemious and regular. <reg orig="Medita-|tion">Meditation</reg>
                        <lb/> in the forest, or reading in his closet, seemed to <reg

                        <lb/> and employment. He estranged himself from company, <lb/> not because
                        society afforded no pleasure, but because <reg orig="studi-|ous"
                            >studious</reg>
                        <lb/> seclusion afforded him chief satisfaction.</p>
                    <p>No one was more idolized by his unsuspecting neighbors. <lb/> His scholars
                        revered him as a father, and made under his <lb/> tuition a remarkable
                        proficiency. His character seemed <lb/> open to boundless inspection, and
                        his conduct was <reg orig="pro-|nounced">pronounced</reg>
                        <lb/> by all to be faultless.</p>
                    <p>At the end of a year the scene was changed. A daughter <lb/> of one of his
                        patrons, young, artless and beautiful, appeared <lb/> to have fallen a prey
                        to the arts of some detestable seducer. <lb/> The betrayer was gradually
                        detected, and successive <reg orig="dis-|coveries">discoveries</reg>
                        <lb/> shewed that the same artifices had been practised, <lb/> with the same
                        success upon many others. Colvill was the <lb/> arch-villain. He retired
                        from the storm of vengeance that <lb/> gathering over him, and had not been
                        heard of since that <lb/> period.</p>
                    <p>I saw him rarely, and for a short time, and I was a mere <lb/> boy. Hence,
                        the failure to recollect his voice, and to <reg orig="per-|ceive"
                            >perceive</reg>
                        <lb/> that the voice of him, immured in the room above, was <lb/> the same
                        with that of Colvill. Though I had slight reasons <lb/> for recognising his
                        features, or accents, I had abundant cause <lb/> to think of him with
                        detestation, and pursue him with <reg orig="im-|placable">implacable</reg>
                        <lb/> revenge, for the victim of his acts, she whose ruin <lb/> was first
                        detected, was&mdash;<hi rend="italic">my sister.</hi></p>
                    <p>This unhappy girl escaped from the upbraidings of her <lb/> parents, from the
                        contumelies of the world, from the <reg orig="goad-|ings">goadings</reg>
                        <lb/> of remorse, and the anguish flowing from the perfidy <lb/> and
                        desertion of Colvill, in a voluntary death. She was <lb/> innocent and
                        lovely. Previous to this evil, my soul was <lb/> linked with her's by a
                        thousand resemblances and <reg orig="sympa-|thies">sympathies</reg>, <lb/>
                        as well as by perpetual intercourse from infancy, and <lb/> by the fraternal
                        relation. She was my sister, my preceptress <lb/>
                        <pb n="171" entity="eaf033v2_0184" pid="uva-lib:349491"/> and friend, but
                        she died&mdash;her end was violent, untimely, and <lb/> criminal!&mdash;I
                        cannot think of her without heart-bursting <lb/> grief, of her destroyer,
                        without a rancor which I know to <lb/> be wrong, but which I cannot
                        subdue.</p>
                    <p>When the image of Colvill rushed, upon this occasion, <lb/> on my thought, I
                        almost started on my feet. To meet him, <lb/> after so long a separation,
                        here, and in these circumstances, <lb/> was so unlooked for and abrupt an
                        event, and revived a <lb/> tribe of such hateful impulses and agonizing
                        recollections, <lb/> that a total revolution seemed to have been effected in
                        my <lb/> frame. His recognition of my person, his aversion to be <lb/> seen,
                        his ejaculation of terror and surprise on first hearing <lb/> my voice, all
                        contributed to strengthen my belief.</p>
                    <p>How was I to act? My feeble frame could but illy <reg orig="sec-|ond"
                            >second</reg>
                        <lb/> my vengeful purposes; but vengeance, though it <reg orig="some-|times"
                            >sometimes</reg>
                        <lb/> occupied my thoughts, was hindered by my reason, <lb/> from leading me
                        in any instance, to outrage or even to <reg orig="up-|braiding"
                            >upbraiding</reg>.</p>
                    <p>All my wishes with regard to this man, were limited to <lb/> expelling his
                        image from my memory, and to shunning a <lb/> meeting with him. That he had
                        not opened the door at my <lb/> bidding, was now a topic of joy. To look
                        upon some <reg orig="bot-|tomless">bottomless</reg>
                        <lb/> pit, into which I was about to be cast headlong, and <lb/> alive, was
                        less to be abhorred than to look upon the face of <lb/> Colvill. Had I known
                        that he had taken refuge in this house, <lb/> no power should have compelled
                        me to enter it. To be <lb/> immersed in the infection of the hospital, and
                        to be hurried, <lb/> yet breathing and observant, to my grave, was a more
                            <reg orig="sup-|portable">supportable</reg>
                        <lb/> fate.</p>
                    <p>I dwell, with self-condemnation and shame, upon this <lb/> part of my story.
                        To feel extraordinary indignation at vice, <lb/> merely because we have
                        partaken in an extraordinary <reg orig="de-|gree">degree</reg>, <lb/> of its
                        mischiefs, is unjustifiable. To regard the <reg orig="wick-|ed">wicked</reg>
                        <lb/> with no emotion but pity, to be active in reclaiming them, <lb/> in
                        controling their malevolence, and preventing or repairing <lb/> the ills
                        which they produce, is the only province of duty. <lb/> This lesson, as well
                        as a thousand others, I have yet to learn; <lb/> but I despair of living
                        long enough for that or any beneficial <lb/> purpose.</p>
                    <p>My emotions with regard to Colvill, were erroneous, but <lb/> omnipotent. I
                        started from my bed, and prepared to rush <lb/>
                        <pb n="172" entity="eaf033v2_0185" pid="uva-lib:349492"/> into the street. I
                        was careless of the lot that should befall <lb/> me, since no fate could be
                        worse than that of abiding under <lb/> the same roof with a wretch spotted
                        with so many crimes.</p>
                    <p>I had not set my feet upon the floor before my <reg orig="precipi-|tation"
                            >precipitation</reg>
                        <lb/> was checked by a sound from above. The door of <lb/> the study was
                        cautiously and slowly opened. This incident <lb/> admitted only of one
                        construction, supposing all obstructions <lb/> removed. Colvill was creeping
                        from his hiding-place, and <lb/> would probably fly with speed from the
                        house. My belief <lb/> of his sickness was now confuted. An illicit design
                        was <lb/> congenial with his character and congruous with those <reg
                            orig="ap-|pearances">appearances</reg>
                        <lb/> already observed.</p>
                    <p>I had no power or wish to obstruct his flight. I thought <lb/> of it with
                        transport, and once more threw myself upon the <lb/> bed, and wrapped my
                        averted face in the carpet. He <lb/> would probably pass this door,
                        unobservant of me, and my <lb/> muffled face would save me from the agonies
                        connected with <lb/> the sight of him.</p>
                    <p>The footsteps above were distinguishable, though it was <lb/> manifest that
                        they moved with lightsomeness and <reg orig="circum-|spection"
                            >circumspection</reg>. <lb/> They reached the stair and descended. The
                        <lb/> room in which I lay, was, like the rest, obscured by the <lb/> closed
                        shutters. This obscurity now gave way to a light, <lb/> resembling that
                        glimmering and pale reflection which I had <lb/> noticed in the study. My
                        eyes, though averted from the <lb/> door, were disengaged from the folds
                        which covered the rest <lb/> of my head, and observed these tokens of
                        Colvill's approach, <lb/> flitting on the wall.</p>
                    <p>My feverish perturbations increased as he drew nearer. <lb/> He reached the
                        door, and stopped. The light rested for a <lb/> moment. Presently he entered
                        the apartment. My <reg orig="emo-|tions">emotions</reg>
                        <lb/> suddenly rose to an height that would not be controled. <lb/> I
                        imagined that he approached the bed, and was gazing <lb/> upon me. At the
                        same moment, by an involuntary impulse, <lb/> I threw off my covering, and,
                        turning my face, fixed my <lb/> eyes upon my visitant.</p>
                    <p>It was as I suspected. The figure, lifting in his right <lb/> hand a candle,
                        and gazing at the bed, with lineaments and <lb/> attitude, bespeaking
                        fearful expectation and tormenting <lb/> doubts, was now beheld. One glance
                        communicated to <lb/> my senses all the parts of this terrific vision. A
                        sinking at <lb/>

                        </pb> my heart, as if it had been penetrated by a dagger, seized <lb/> me.
                        This was not enough, I uttered a shriek, too rueful <lb/> and loud not to
                        have startled the attention of the passengers, <lb/> if any had, at that
                        moment, been passing the street.</p>
                    <p>Heaven seemed to have decreed that this period should <lb/> be filled with
                        trials of my equanimity and fortitude. The test <lb/> of my courage was once
                        more employed to cover me with <lb/> humiliation and remorse. This second
                        time, my fancy <reg orig="con-|jured">conjured</reg>
                        <lb/> up a spectre, and I shuddered as if the grave were <lb/> forsaken and
                        the unquiet dead haunted my pillow.</p>
                    <p>The visage and the shape had indeed preternatural <reg orig="atti-|tudes"
                            >attitudes</reg>, <lb/> but they belonged, not to Colvill, but

                    <p><hi rend="small-caps">He</hi> whom I had accompanied to the midst of the
                        river; <lb/> whom I had imagined that I saw sink to rise no more, was <lb/>
                        now before me. Though incapable of precluding the <reg orig="ground-|less"
                            >groundless</reg>
                        <lb/> belief of preternatural visitations, I was able to banish the <lb/>
                        phantom almost at the same instant at which it appeared. <lb/> Welbeck had
                        escaped from the stream alive; or had, by <lb/> some inconceivable means,
                        been restored to life.</p>
                    <p>The first was the most plausible conclusion. It instantly <lb/> engendered a
                        suspicion, that his plunging into the water was <lb/> an artifice, intended
                        to establish a belief of his death. His <lb/> own tale had shewn him to be
                        versed in frauds, and flexible <lb/> to evil. But was he not associated with
                        Colvill; and what, <lb/> but a compact in iniquity, could bind together such
                        men?</p>
                    <p>While thus musing, Welbeck's countenance and gesture <lb/> displayed emotions
                        too vehement for speech. The glances <lb/> that he fixed upon me were
                        unsteadfast and wild. He <lb/> walked along the floor, stopping at each
                        moment, and <reg orig="dart-|ing">darting</reg>
                        <lb/> looks of eagerness upon me. A conflict of passions <lb/> kept him
                        mute. At length, advancing to the bed, on the <lb/> side of which I was now
                        sitting, he addressed me.</p>
                    <p>What is this? Are you here? In defiance of pestilence, <lb/> are you actuated
                        by some demon to haunt me, like the <lb/>
                        <pb n="174" entity="eaf033v2_0187" pid="uva-lib:349494"/> ghost of my
                        offences, and cover me with shame? What <lb/> have I to do with that
                        dauntless, yet guiltless front? With <lb/> that foolishly, confiding, and
                        obsequious, yet erect and <reg orig="un-|conquerable">unconquerable</reg>
                        <lb/> spirit? Is there no means of evading your <lb/> pursuit? Must I dip my
                        hands, a second time, in blood; <lb/> and dig for you a grave by the side of
                        Watson?</p>
                    <p>These words were listened to with calmness. I suspected <lb/> and pitied the
                        man, but I did not fear him. His words and <lb/> his looks were indicative
                        less of cruelty than madness. I <lb/> looked at him with an air
                        compassionate and wistful. I <lb/> spoke with mildness and composure.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Welbeck, you are unfortunate and criminal. Would <lb/> to God I could
                        restore you to happiness and virtue; but, <lb/> though my desire be strong,
                        I have no power to change <lb/> your habits or rescue you from misery.</p>
                    <p>I believed you to be dead. I rejoice to find myself <reg orig="mis-|taken"
                            >mistaken</reg>. <lb/> While you live, there is room to hope that your
                        <lb/> errors will be cured; and the turmoils, and inquietudes that <lb/>
                        have hitherto beset your guilty progress, will vanish by your <lb/>
                        reverting into better paths.</p>
                    <p>From me you have nothing to fear. If your welfare will <lb/> be promoted by
                        my silence on the subject of your history, <lb/> my silence shall be
                        inviolate. I deem not lightly of my <lb/> promises. They are given and shall
                        not be recalled.</p>
                    <p>This meeting was casual. Since I believed you to be <lb/> dead, it could not
                        be otherwise. You err, if you suppose <lb/> that any injury will accrue to
                        you from my life; but you <lb/> need not discard that error. Since my death
                        is coming, I <lb/> am not averse to your adopting the belief that the event
                        is <lb/> fortunate to you.</p>
                    <p>Death is the inevitable and universal lot. When or how <lb/> it comes, is of
                        little moment. To stand, when so many <lb/> thousands are falling around me,
                        is not to be expected. I <lb/> have acted an humble and obscure part in the
                        world, and <lb/> my career has been short; but I murmur not at the decree
                        <lb/> that makes it so.</p>
                    <p>The pestilence is now upon me. The chances of <reg orig="recov-|ery"
                            >recovery</reg>
                        <lb/> are too slender to deserve my confidence. I came <lb/> hither to die
                        unmolested, and at peace. All I ask of you is <lb/> to consult your own
                        safety by immediate flight; and not to <lb/>
                        <pb n="175" entity="eaf033v2_0188" pid="uva-lib:349495"/> disappoint my

                        <lb/> to the agents of the hospital.</p>
                    <p>Welbeck listened with the deepest attention. The <reg orig="wild-|ness"
                            >wildness</reg>
                        <lb/> of his air disappeared, and gave place to perplexity <lb/> and
                        apprehension.</p>
                    <p>You are sick, said he, in a tremulous tone, in which terror <lb/> was mingled
                        with affection. You know this, and expect not <lb/> to recover. No mother,
                        nor sister, nor friend will be near <lb/> to administer food, or medicine,
                        or comfort; yet you can <lb/> talk calmly; can be thus considerate of
                        others&mdash;of me; <lb/> whose guilt has been so deep, and who has merited
                        so little <lb/> at your hands!</p>
                    <p>Wretched coward! Thus miserable as I am, and expect <lb/> to be, I cling to
                        life. To comply with your heroic counsel, <lb/> and to fly; to leave you
                        thus desolate and helpless, is the <lb/> strongest impulse. Fain would I
                        resist it, but cannot.</p>
                    <p>To desert you would be flagitious and dastardly beyond <lb/> all former acts,
                        yet to stay with you is to contract the <reg orig="dis-|ease">disease</reg>,
                        <lb/> and to perish after you.</p>
                    <p>Life, burthened as it is with guilt and ignominy, is still <lb/>
                        dear&mdash;yet you exhort me to go; you dispense with my <reg
                            orig="as-|sistance">assistance</reg>. <lb/> Indeed, I could be of no
                        use, I should injure <lb/> myself and profit you nothing. I cannot go into
                        the city <lb/> and procure a physician or attendant. I must never more <lb/>
                        appear in the streets of this city. I must leave you then.&mdash; <lb/> He
                        hurried to the door. Again, he hesitated. I renewed <lb/> my entreaties that
                        he would leave me; and encouraged his <lb/> belief that his presence might
                        endanger himself without <lb/> conferring the slightest benefit upon me.</p>
                    <p>Whither should I fly? The wide world contains no <lb/> asylum for me. I lived
                        but on one condition. I came <lb/> hither to find what would save me from
                        ruin&mdash;from death. <lb/> I find it not. It has vanished. Some audacious
                        and <reg orig="for-|tunate">fortunate</reg>
                        <lb/> hand has snatched it from its place, and now my <lb/> ruin is
                        complete. My last hope is extinct.</p>
                    <p>Yes. Mervyn! I will stay with you. I will hold your <lb/> head. I will put
                        water to your lips. I will watch night <lb/> and day by your side. When you
                        die, I will carry you by <lb/> night to the neighboring field; will bury
                        you, and water <lb/> your grave with those tears that are due to your <reg
                            orig="incompa-|rable">incomparable</reg>
                        <lb/>
                        <pb n="176" entity="eaf033v2_0189" pid="uva-lib:349496"/> worth and untimely
                        destiny. Then I will lay myself <lb/> in your bed, and wait for the same
                        oblivion.</p>
                    <p>Welbeck seemed now no longer to be fluctuating <reg orig="be-|tween"
                            >between</reg>
                        <lb/> opposite purposes. His tempestuous features <reg orig="sub-|sided"
                            >subsided</reg>
                        <lb/> into calm. He put the candle, still lighted, on the <lb/> table, and
                        paced the floor with less disorder than at his first <lb/> entrance.</p>
                    <p>His resolution was seen to be the dictate of despair. I <lb/> hoped that it
                        would not prove invincible to my <reg orig="remon-|strances"
                            >remonstrances</reg>. <lb/> I was conscious that his attendance might
                            <reg orig="pre-|clude">preclude</reg>, <lb/> in some degree, my own
                        exertions, and alleviate the <lb/> pangs of death; but these consolations
                        might be purchased <lb/> too dear. To receive them at the hazard of his life
                        would <lb/> be to make them odious.</p>
                    <p>But if he should remain, what conduct would his <reg orig="com-|panion"
                            >companion</reg>
                        <lb/> pursue? Why did he continue in the study when <lb/> Welbeck had
                        departed? By what motives were those men <lb/> led hither? I addressed
                        myself to Welbeck.</p>
                    <p>Your resolution to remain is hasty and rash. By <reg orig="per-|sisting"
                            >persisting</reg>
                        <lb/> in it, you will add to the miseries of my condition; <lb/> you will
                        take away the only hope that I cherished. But, <lb/> however you may act,
                        Colvill or I must be banished from <lb/> this roof. What is the league
                        between you? Break it, I <lb/> conjure you; before his frauds have involved
                        you in <reg orig="inex-|tricable">inextricable</reg>
                        <lb/> destruction.</p>
                    <p>Welbeck looked at me with some expression of doubt.</p>
                    <p>I mean, continued I, the man whose voice I heard above. <lb/> He is a villain
                        and betrayer. I have manifold proofs of his <lb/> guilt. Why does he linger
                        behind you? However you may <lb/> decide, it is fitting that he should
                        vanish.</p>
                    <p>Alas! said Welbeck, I have no companion; none to <reg orig="par-|take"
                            >partake</reg>
                        <lb/> with me in good or evil. I came hither alone.</p>
                    <p>How? exclaimed I. Whom did I hear in the room <lb/> above? Some one answered
                        my interrogations and <reg orig="en-|treaties">entreaties</reg>, <lb/> whom
                        I too certainly recognised. Why does he <lb/> remain?</p>
                    <p>You heard no one but myself. The design that brought <lb/> me hither, was to
                        be accomplished without a witness. I <lb/> desired to escape detection, and
                        repelled your solicitations <lb/> for admission in a counterfeited
                        voice.</p>
                    <pb n="177" entity="eaf033v2_0190" pid="uva-lib:349497"/>
                    <p>That voice belonged to one from whom I had lately <lb/> parted. What his
                        merits or demerits are, I know not. He <lb/> found me wandering in the
                        forests of New Jersey. He <lb/> took me to his home. When seized by a
                        lingering malady, <lb/> he nursed me with fidelity and tenderness. When <reg
                            orig="some-|what">somewhat</reg>
                        <lb/> recovered, I speeded hither; but our ignorance of each <lb/> others
                        character and views was mutual and profound.</p>
                    <p>I deemed it useful to assume a voice different from my <lb/> own. This was
                        the last which I had heard, and this <reg orig="arbi-|trary">arbitrary</reg>
                        <lb/> and casual circumstance decided my choice.</p>
                    <p>This imitation was too perfect, and had influenced my <lb/> fears too
                        strongly, to be easily credited. I suspected <reg orig="Wel-|beck"
                            >Welbeck</reg>
                        <lb/> of some new artifice to baffle my conclusions and <lb/> mislead my
                        judgment. This suspicion, however, yielded to <lb/> his earnest and repeated
                        declarations. If Colvill were not <lb/> here, where had he made his abode?
                        How came <reg orig="friend-|ship">friendship</reg>
                        <lb/> and intercourse between Welbeck and him? By what <lb/> miracle escaped
                        the former from the river, into which I had <lb/> imagined him forever
                        sunk?</p>
                    <p>I will answer you, said he, with candor. You know <reg orig="al-|ready"
                            >already</reg>
                        <lb/> too much for me to have any interest in concealing <lb/> any part of
                        my life. You have discovered my existence, <lb/> and the causes that rescued
                        me from destruction may be <lb/> told without detriment to my person or
                        fame.</p>
                    <p>When I leaped into the river, I intended to perish. I <lb/> harbored no
                        previous doubts of my ability to execute my <lb/> fatal purpose. In this
                        respect I was deceived. Suffocation <lb/> would not come at my bidding. My
                        muscles and limbs <lb/> rebelled against my will. There was a mechanical
                            <reg orig="repug-|nance">repugnance</reg>
                        <lb/> to the loss of life, which I could not vanquish. My <lb/> struggles
                        might thrust me below the surface, but my lips <lb/> were spontaneously
                        shut, and excluded the torrent from <lb/> my lungs. When my breath was
                        exhausted, the efforts that <lb/> kept me at the bottom were involuntarily
                        remitted, and I <lb/> rose to the surface.</p>
                    <p>I cursed my own pusillanimity. Thrice I plunged to the <lb/> bottom, and as
                        often rose again. My aversion to life swiftly <lb/> diminished, and at
                        length, I consented to make use of my <lb/> skill in swimming, which has
                        seldom been exceeded, to <reg orig="pro-|long">prolong</reg>
                        <lb/> my existence. I landed in a few minutes on the Jersey <lb/> shore.</p>
                    <pb n="178" entity="eaf033v2_0191" pid="uva-lib:349498"/>
                    <p>This scheme being frustrated, I sunk into dreariness and <lb/> inactivity. I
                        felt as if no dependence could be placed upon <lb/> my courage, as if any
                        effort I should make for self-<reg orig="destruc-|tion">destruction</reg>
                        <lb/> would be fruitless; yet existence was as void as ever of <lb/>
                        enjoyment and embellishment. My means of living were <lb/> annihilated. I
                        saw no path before me. To shun the <lb/> presence of mankind was my
                        sovereign wish. Since I <lb/> could not die, by my own hands, I must be
                        content to crawl <lb/> upon the surface, till a superior fate should permit
                        me to <lb/> perish.</p>
                    <p>I wandered into the centre of the wood. I stretched <lb/> myself on the mossy
                        verge of a brook, and gazed at the <lb/> stars till they disappeared. The
                        next day was spent with <lb/> little variation. The cravings of hunger were
                        felt, and the <lb/> sensation was a joyous one, since it afforded me the
                            <reg orig="practi-|cable">practicable</reg>
                        <lb/> means of death. To refrain from food was easy, <lb/> since some
                        efforts would be needful to procure it, and these <lb/> efforts should not
                        be made. Thus was the sweet oblivion <lb/> for which I so earnestly panted,
                        placed within my reach.</p>
                    <p>Three days of abstinence, and reverie, and solitude <reg orig="suc-|ceeded"
                            >succeeded</reg>. <lb/> On the evening of the fourth, I was seated on a
                        <lb/> rock, with my face buried in my hands. Some one laid <lb/> his hand
                        upon my shoulder. I started and looked up. I <reg orig="be-|held"
                            >beheld</reg>
                        <lb/> a face, beaming with compassion and benignity. He <lb/> endeavored to
                        extort from me the cause of my solitude and <lb/> sorrow. I disregarded his
                        entreaties, and was obstinately <lb/> silent.</p>
                    <p>Finding me invincible in this respect, he invited me to <lb/> his college,
                        which was hard by. I repelled him at first, with <lb/> impatience and anger,
                        but he was not to be discouraged or <lb/> intimidated. To elude his
                        persuasions I was obliged to <reg orig="com-|ply">comply</reg>. <lb/> My
                        strength was gone and the vital fabric was <reg orig="crum-|bling"
                            >crumbling</reg>
                        <lb/> into pieces. A fever raged in my veins, and I was <lb/> consoled by
                        reflecting that my life was at once assailed by <lb/> famine and
                        disease.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, my gloomy meditations experienced no <reg orig="res-|pite"
                            >respite</reg>. <lb/> I incessantly ruminated on the events of my past
                        <lb/> life. The long series of my crimes arose daily and afresh <lb/> to my
                        imagination. The image of Lodi was recalled, his <lb/> expiring looks and
                        the directions which were mutually <lb/> given respecting his sister's and
                        his property.</p>
                    <pb n="179" entity="eaf033v2_0192" pid="uva-lib:349499"/>
                    <p>As I perpetually revolved these incidents, they assumed <lb/> new forms, and
                        were linked with new associations. The <lb/> volume written by his father,
                        and transferred to me by <lb/> tokens, which were now remembered to be more
                        emphatic <lb/> than the nature of the composition seemed to justify, was
                        <lb/> likewise remembered. It came attended by recollections <lb/>
                        respecting a volume which I filled, when a youth, with <reg
                            orig="ex-|tracts">extracts</reg>
                        <lb/> from the Roman and Greek poets. Besides this literary <lb/> purpose I
                        likewise used to preserve in it the bank-bills, <lb/> with the keeping or
                        carriage of which I chanced to be <reg orig="en-|trusted">entrusted</reg>.
                        <lb/> This image led me back to the leather-case <reg orig="con-|taining"
                            >containing</reg>
                        <lb/> Lodi's property, which was put into my hands at the <lb/> same time
                        with the volume.</p>
                    <p>These images now gave birth to a third conception, which <lb/> darted on my
                        benighted understanding like an electrical flash. <lb/> Was it not possible
                        that part of Lodi's property might be <lb/> enclosed within the leaves of
                        this volume? In hastily turning <lb/> it over, I recollected to have noticed
                        leaves whose edges by <lb/> accident or design adhered to each other. Lodi,
                        in <reg orig="speak-|ing">speaking</reg>
                        <lb/> of the sale of his father's West-India property, mentioned <lb/> that
                        the sum obtained for it, was forty thousand dollars. <lb/> Half only of this
                        sum had been discovered by me. How had <lb/> the remainder been
                        appropriated? Surely this volume <reg orig="con-|tained">contained</reg>
                        <lb/> it.</p>
                    <p>The influence of this thought was like the infusion of a <lb/> new soul into
                        my frame. From torpid and desperate, from <lb/> inflexible aversion to
                        medicine and food, I was changed in <lb/> a moment into vivacity and hope,
                        into ravenous avidity for <lb/> whatever could contribute to my restoration
                        to health.</p>
                    <p>I was not without pungent regrets and racking fears. That <lb/> this volume
                        would be ravished away by creditors or <reg orig="plun-|derers"
                            >plunderers</reg>, <lb/> was possible. Every hour might be that which
                            <reg orig="de-|cided">decided</reg>
                        <lb/> my fate. The first impulse was to seek my dwelling <lb/> and search
                        for this precious deposit.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, my perturbations and impatience only <reg orig="exas-|perated"
                            >exasperated</reg>
                        <lb/> my disease. While chained to my bed, the rumor <lb/> of pestilence was
                        spread abroad. This event, however, <lb/> generally calamitous, was
                        propitious to me, and was hailed <lb/> with satisfaction. It multiplied the
                        chances that my house <lb/> and its furniture would be unmolested.</p>
                    <pb n="180" entity="eaf033v2_0193" pid="uva-lib:349500"/>
                    <p>My friend was assiduous and indefatigable in his kindness. <lb/> My
                        deportment, before and subsequent to the revival of my <lb/> hopes, was
                        incomprehensible, and argued nothing less than <lb/> insanity. My thoughts
                        were carefully concealed from him, <lb/> and all that he witnessed was
                        contradictory and <reg orig="unintelli-|gible">unintelligible</reg>.</p>
                    <p>At length, my strength was sufficiently restored. I <reg orig="re-|sisted"
                            >resisted</reg>
                        <lb/> all my protector's importunities, to postpone my <reg
                            orig="de-|parture">departure</reg>
                        <lb/> till the perfect confirmation of my health. I designed <lb/> to enter
                        the city at midnight, that prying eyes might be <lb/> eluded; to bear with
                        me a candle and the means of lighting <lb/> it, to explore my way to my
                        ancient study, and to ascertain <lb/> my future claim to existence and
                        felicity.</p>
                    <p>I crossed the river this morning. My impatience would <lb/> not suffer me to
                        wait till evening. Considering the <reg orig="desola-|tion">desolation</reg>
                        <lb/> of the city, I thought I might venture to approach <lb/> thus near,
                        without hazard of detection. The house, at all <lb/> its avenues was closed.
                        I stole into the back court. A <lb/> window shutter proved to be unfastened.
                        I entered, and <lb/> discovered closets and cabinets, unfastened and emptied
                        of <lb/> all their contents. At this spectacle my heart sunk. My <lb/>
                        books, doubtless, had shared the common destiny. My <lb/> blood throbbed
                        with painful vehemence as I approached the <lb/> study and opened the
                        door.</p>
                    <p>My hopes, that languished for a moment, were revived by <lb/> the sight of my
                        shelves, furnished as formerly. I had lighted <lb/> my candle below, for I
                        desired not to awaken observation <lb/> and suspicion, by unclosing the
                        windows. My eye eagerly <lb/> sought the spot where I remembered to have
                        left the volume. <lb/> Its place was empty. The object of all my hopes had
                        <lb/> eluded my grasp, and disappeared forever.</p>
                    <p>To paint my confusion, to repeat my execrations on the <lb/> infatuation,
                        which had rendered, during so long a time, that <lb/> it was in my
                        possession, this treasure useless to me, and my <lb/> curses of the fatal
                        interference which had snatched away <lb/> this prize, would be only
                        aggravations of my disappointment <lb/> and my sorrow. You found me in this
                        state, and know <lb/> what followed.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="small-caps">This</hi> narrative threw new light on the character of
                            <reg orig="Wel-|beck">Welbeck</reg>. <lb/> If accident had given him
                        possession of this <reg orig="trea-|sure">treasure</reg>, <lb/> it was easy
                        to predict on what schemes of luxury and <lb/> selfishness it would have
                        been expended. The same <reg orig="de-|pendence">dependence</reg>
                        <lb/> on the world's erroneous estimation, the same <reg orig="de-|votion"
                            >devotion</reg>
                        <lb/> to imposture, and thoughtlessness of futurity, would <lb/> have
                        constituted the picture of his future life, as had <reg
                            orig="distin-|guished">distinguished</reg>
                        <lb/> the past.</p>
                    <p>This money was another's. To retain it for his own use <lb/> was criminal. Of
                        this crime he appeared to be as insensible <lb/> as ever. His own
                        gratification was the supreme law of his <lb/> actions. To be subjected to
                        the necessity of honest labor, <lb/> was the heaviest of all evils, and one
                        from which he was <lb/> willing to escape by the commission of suicide.</p>
                    <p>The volume which he sought was mine. It was my duty <lb/> to restore it to
                        the rightful owner, or, if the legal claimant <lb/> could not be found, to
                        employ it in the promotion of virtue <lb/> and happiness. To give it to
                        Welbeck was to consecrate <lb/> it to the purpose of selfishness and misery.
                        My right, <lb/> legally considered, was as valid as his.</p>
                    <p>But if I intended not to resign it to him, was it proper to <lb/> disclose
                        the truth, and explain by whom the volume was <lb/> purloined from the
                        shelf? The first impulse was to hide this <lb/> truth; but my understanding
                        had been taught, by recent <lb/> occurrences, to question the justice, and
                        deny the <reg orig="useful-|ness">usefulness</reg>
                        <lb/> of secrecy in any case. My principles were true; my <lb/> motives were
                        pure; why should I scruple to avow my <lb/> principles, and vindicate my
                        actions?</p>
                    <p>Welbeck had ceased to be dreaded or revered. That <lb/> awe which was once
                        created by his superiority of age, <reg orig="re-|finement">refinement</reg>
                        <lb/> of manners and dignity of garb, had vanished. I <lb/> was a boy in
                        years, an indigent and uneducated rustic, but I <lb/> was able to discern
                        the illusions of power and riches, and <lb/> abjured every claim to esteem
                        that was not founded on <reg orig="in-|tegrity">integrity</reg>. <lb/> There
                        was no tribunal before which I should <reg orig="fal-|ter">falter</reg>
                        <lb/> in asserting the truth, and no species of martyrdom which <lb/> I
                        would not cheerfully embrace in its cause.</p>
                    <pb n="182" entity="eaf033v2_0195" pid="uva-lib:349502"/>
                    <p>After some pause, I said; cannot you conjecture in what <lb/> way this volume
                        has disappeared?</p>
                    <p>No; he answered with a sigh. Why, of all his volumes, <lb/> this only should
                        have vanished, was an inexplicable enigma.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps, said I, it is less important to know how it was <lb/> removed, than
                        by whom it is now possessed.</p>
                    <p>Unquestionably; and yet, unless that knowledge enables <lb/> me to regain the
                        possession it will be useless.</p>
                    <p>Useless then it will be, for the present possessor will <reg orig="ne-|ver"
                            >never</reg>
                        <lb/> return it to you.</p>
                    <p>Indeed, replied he, in a tone of dejection, your conjecture <lb/> is most
                        probable. Such a prize is of too much value to be <lb/> given up.</p>
                    <p>What I have said, flows not from conjecture, but from <lb/> knowledge. I know
                        that it will never be restored to you.</p>
                    <p>At these words, Welbeck looked at me with anxiety and <lb/> doubt.&mdash;You
                            <hi rend="italic">know</hi> that it will not! Have you any <reg
                            orig="know-|ledge">knowledge</reg>
                        <lb/> of the book! Can you tell me what has become of <lb/> it?</p>
                    <p>Yes, after our separation on the river, I returned to this <lb/> house. I
                        found this volume and secured it, you rightly <reg orig="sus-|pected"
                            >suspected</reg>
                        <lb/> its contents. The money was there.</p>
                    <p>Welbeck started as if he had trodden on a mine of gold. <lb/> His first
                        emotion was rapturous, but was immediately <reg orig="chas-|tised"
                            >chastised</reg>
                        <lb/> by some degree of doubt. What has become of it? <lb/> Have you got it?
                        Is it entire? Have you it with you?</p>
                    <p>It is unimpaired. I have got it, and shall hold it as a <reg orig="sa-|cred"
                            >sacred</reg>
                        <lb/> trust for the rightful proprietor.</p>
                    <p>The tone with which this declaration was accompanied, <lb/> shook the new
                        born confidence of Welbeck. The rightful <lb/> proprietor! true, but I am
                        he. To me only it belongs, and <lb/> to me, you are, doubtless, willing to
                        restore it.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Welbeck! It is not my desire to give you <reg orig="perplex-|ity"
                            >perplexity</reg>
                        <lb/> or anguish; to sport with your passions. On the <reg
                            orig="suppo-|sition">supposition</reg>
                        <lb/> of your death, I deemed it no infraction of justice to <lb/> take this
                        manuscript. Accident unfolded its contents. I <lb/> could not hesitate to
                        choose my path. The natural and <lb/> legal successor of Vincentio Lodi is
                        his sister. To her, <lb/> therefore, this property belongs, and to her only
                        will I <lb/> give it.</p>
                    <p>Presumptuous boy! And this is your sage decision. I <lb/>
                        <pb n="183" entity="eaf033v2_0196" pid="uva-lib:349503"/> tell you that I am
                        the owner, and to me you shall render it. <lb/> Who is this girl! childish
                        and ignorant! Unable to consult <lb/> and to act for herself on the most
                        trivial occasion. Am I <lb/> not, by the appointment of her dying brother,
                        her protector <lb/> and guardian? Her age produces a legal incapacity of
                        <lb/> property. Do you imagine that so obvious an expedient, as <lb/> that
                        of procuring my legal appointment as her guardian, was <lb/> overlooked by
                        me? If it were neglected, still my title to <lb/> provide her subsistence
                        and enjoyment is unquestionable.</p>
                    <p>Did I not rescue her from poverty, and prostitution, and <lb/> infamy? Have I
                        not supplied all her wants with incessant <lb/> solicitude? Whatever her
                        condition required has been <lb/> plenteously supplied. This dwelling and
                        its furniture, was <lb/> hers, as far as a rigid jurisprudence would permit.
                        To <reg orig="pre-|scribe">prescribe</reg>
                        <lb/> her expenses and govern her family, was the province <lb/> of her
                        guardian.</p>
                    <p>You have heard the tale of my anguish and despair. <lb/> Whence did they flow
                        but from the frustration of schemes, <lb/> projected for her benefit, as
                        they were executed with her <lb/> money and by means which the authority of
                        her guardian <lb/> fully justified. Why have I encountered this contagious
                            <reg orig="at-|mosphere">atmosphere</reg>, <lb/> and explored my way,
                        like a thief, to this recess, <lb/> but with a view to rescue her from
                        poverty and restore to <lb/> her, her own?</p>
                    <p>Your scruples are ridiculous and criminal. I treat them <lb/> with less
                        severity, because your youth is raw and your <reg orig="con-|ceptions"
                            >conceptions</reg>
                        <lb/> crude. But if, after this proof of the justice of my <lb/> claim, you
                        hesitate to restore the money, I shall treat you as <lb/> a robber, who has
                        plundered my cabinet and refused to <reg orig="re-|fund">refund</reg>
                        <lb/> his spoil.</p>
                    <p>These reasonings were powerful and new. I was <reg orig="ac-|quainted"
                            >acquainted</reg>
                        <lb/> with the rights of guardianship. Welbeck had, in <lb/> some respects,
                        acted as the friend of this lady. To vest <lb/> himself with this office,
                        was the conduct which her youth <lb/> and helplessness prescribed to her
                        friend. His title to this <lb/> money, as her guardian, could not be
                        denied.</p>
                    <p>But how was this statement compatible with former <reg
                            orig="rep-|resentations">representations</reg>? <lb/> No mention had
                        then been made of <reg orig="guardi-|anship">guardianship</reg>. <lb/> By
                        thus acting, he would have thwarted all his <lb/> schemes for winning the
                        esteem of mankind, and fostering <lb/>
                        <pb n="184" entity="eaf033v2_0197" pid="uva-lib:349504"/> the belief which
                        the world entertained of his opulence and <lb/> independence.</p>
                    <p>I was thrown, by these thoughts, into considerable <reg orig="per-|plexity"
                            >perplexity</reg>. <lb/> If his statement were true, his claim to this
                        money <lb/> was established, but I questioned its truth. To intimate my
                        <lb/> doubts of his veracity, would be to provoke abhorrence and <lb/>
                        outrage.</p>
                    <p>His last insinuation was peculiarly momentous. Suppose <lb/> him the
                        fraudulent possessor of this money, shall I be <reg orig="justi-|fied"
                            >justified</reg>
                        <lb/> in taking it away by violence under pretence of <reg
                            orig="restor-|ing">restoring</reg>
                        <lb/> it to the genuine proprietor, who, for aught I know, may <lb/> be
                        dead, or with whom, at least, I may never procure a <lb/> meeting? But will
                        not my behavior on this occasion, be <lb/> deemed illicit? I entered
                        Welbeck's habitation at midnight, <lb/> proceeded to his closet, possessed
                        myself of portable <reg orig="pro-|perty">property</reg>, <lb/> and retired
                        unobserved. Is not guilt imputable to an <lb/> action like this?</p>
                    <p>Welbeck waited with impatience for a conclusion to my <lb/> pause. My
                        perplexity and indecision did not abate, and my <lb/> silence continued. At
                        length, he repeated his demands, with <lb/> new vehemence. I was compelled
                        to answer. I told him, <lb/> in few words, that his reasonings had not
                        convinced me of <lb/> the equity of his claim, and that my determination was
                            <reg orig="un-|altered">unaltered</reg>.</p>
                    <p>He had not expected this inflexibility from one in my <lb/> situation. The
                        folly of opposition, when my feebleness and <lb/> loneliness were contrasted
                        with his activity and resources, <lb/> appeared to him monstrous and
                        glaring, but his contempt <lb/> was converted into rage and fear when he
                        reflected that this <lb/> folly might finally defeat his hopes. He had
                        probably <reg orig="de-|termined">determined</reg>
                        <lb/> to obtain the money, let the purchase cost what it <lb/> would, but
                        was willing to exhaust pacific expedients before <lb/> he should resort to
                        force. He might likewise question <lb/> whether the money was within his
                        reach. I had told him <lb/> that I had it, but whether it was now about me,
                        was <reg orig="some-|what">somewhat</reg>
                        <lb/> dubious; yet, though he used no direct inquiries, he <lb/> chose to
                        proceed on the supposition of its being at hand. <lb/> His angry tones were
                        now changed into those of <reg orig="remon-|strance">remonstrance</reg>
                        <lb/> and persuasion.</p>
                    <p>Your present behavior, Mervyn, does not justify the <reg orig="ex-|pectation"
                            >expectation</reg>
                        <lb/> I had formed of you. You have been guilty of a <lb/>

                        ingratitude, but your infatuation and folly are, at least, as <lb/> glaring
                        as your guilt. Do you think I can credit your <reg orig="as-|sertions"
                            >assertions</reg>
                        <lb/> that you keep this money for another, when I <reg orig="recol-|lect"
                            >recollect</reg>
                        <lb/> that six weeks have passed since you carried it off? <lb/> Why have
                        you not sought the owner and restored it to her? <lb/> If your intentions
                        had been honest, would you have suffered <lb/> so long a time to elapse
                        without doing this? It is plain, that <lb/> you designed to keep it for your
                        own use.</p>
                    <p>But whether this were your purpose or not, you have no <lb/> longer power to
                        restore it or retain it. You say that you <lb/> came hither to die. If so,
                        what is to be the fate of the <reg orig="mo-|ney">money</reg>? <lb/> In your
                        present situation you cannot gain access to <lb/> the lady. Some other must
                        inherit this wealth. Next to <lb/>
                        <hi rend="italic">Signora Lodi,</hi> whose right can be put in competition
                        with <lb/> mine? But if you will not give it to me, on my own <reg
                            orig="ac-|count">account</reg>, <lb/> let it be given in trust for her.
                        Let me be the bearer <lb/> of it to her own hands. I have already shewn you
                        that my <lb/> claim to it, as her guardian, is legal and incontrovertible,
                        but <lb/> this claim, I wave. I will merely be the executor of your <lb/>
                        will. I will bind myself to comply with your directions by <lb/> any oath,
                        however solemn and tremendous, which you shall <lb/> prescribe.</p>
                    <p>As long as my own heart acquitted me, these imputations <lb/> of dishonesty
                        affected me but little. They excited no <reg orig="an-|ger">anger</reg>,
                        <lb/> because they originated in ignorance, and were <reg orig="ren-|dered"
                            >rendered</reg>
                        <lb/> plausible to Welbeck, by such facts as were known <lb/> to him. It was
                        needless to confute the charge by elaborate <lb/> and circumstantial
                        details.</p>
                    <p>It was true that my recovery was, in the highest degree, <lb/> improbable,
                        and that my death would put an end to my <lb/> power over this money; but
                        had I not determined to secure <lb/> its useful application, in case of my
                        death? This project <lb/> was obstructed by the presence of Welbeck, but I
                        hoped <lb/> that his love of life would induce him to fly. He might <lb/>
                        wrest this volume from me by violence, or he might wait till <lb/> my death
                        should give him peaceable possession. But these, <lb/> though probable
                        events, were not certain, and would, by <lb/> no means, justify the
                        voluntary surrender. His strength, if <lb/>
                        <pb n="186" entity="eaf033v2_0199" pid="uva-lib:349506"/> employed for this
                        end, could not be resisted; but then it <lb/> would be a sacrifice, not to
                        choice, but necessity.</p>
                    <p>Promises were easily given, but were surely not to be <lb/> confided in.
                        Welbeck's own tale, in which it could not be <lb/> imagined that he had
                        aggravated his defects, attested the <lb/> frailty of his virtue. To put
                        into his hands a sum like this, <lb/> in expectation of his delivering it to
                        another, when my <lb/> death would cover the transaction with impenetrable
                        secrecy, <lb/> would be, indeed, a proof of that infatuation which be <lb/>
                        thought proper to impute to me.</p>
                    <p>These thoughts influenced my resolutions, but they were <lb/> revolved in
                        silence. To state them verhally was useless. <lb/> They would not justify my
                        conduct in his eyes. They <lb/> would only exasperate dispute, and impel him
                        to those <lb/> acts of violence which I was desirous of preventing. The
                        <lb/> sooner this controversy should end, and I in any measure <lb/> be
                        freed from the obstruction of his company, the better.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Welbeck, said I, my regard to your safety compels <lb/> me to wish that
                        this interview should terminate. At a <reg orig="dif-|ferent"
                            >different</reg>
                        <lb/> time, I should not be unwilling to discuss this matter. <lb/> Now it
                        will be fruitless. My conscience points out to me <lb/> too clearly the path
                        I should pursue for me to mistake it. <lb/> As long as I have power over
                        this money I shall keep it for <lb/> the use of the unfortunate lady, whom I
                        have seen in this <lb/> house. I shall exert myself to find her, but if that
                        be <reg orig="im-|possible">impossible</reg>, <lb/> I shall appropriate it
                        in a way, in which you shall <lb/> have no participation.</p>
                    <p>I will not repeat the contest that succeeded between my <lb/> forbearance and
                        his passions. I listened to the dictates of <lb/> his rage and his avarice
                        in silence. Astonishment, at my <lb/> inflexibility, was blended with his
                        anger. By turns be <reg orig="com-|mented">commented</reg>
                        <lb/> on the guilt and on the folly of my resolutions. <lb/> Sometimes his
                        emotions would mount into fury, and he <lb/> would approach me in a menacing
                        attitude, and lift his hand <lb/> as if he would exterminate me at a blow.
                        My languid eyes, <lb/> my cheeks glowing, and my temples throbbing with
                        fever, <lb/> and my total passiveness, attracted his attention and <reg

                        <lb/> his stroke. Compassion would take place of rage, <lb/> and the belief
                        be revived that remonstrances and arguments <lb/> would answer his
                        purpose.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="small-caps">This</hi> scene lasted, I know not how long. Insensibly
                        the <lb/> passions and reasonings of Welbeck assumed a new form. <lb/> A
                        grief, mingled with perplexity, overspread his <reg orig="counte-|nance"
                            >countenance</reg>. <lb/> He ceased to contend or to speak. His regards
                        <lb/> were withdrawn from me, on whom they had hitherto been <lb/> fixed;
                        and wandering or vacant, testified a conflict of mind, <lb/> terrible beyond
                        any that my young imagination had ever <lb/> conceived.</p>
                    <p>For a time, he appeared to be unconscious of my <reg orig="pre-|sence"
                            >presence</reg>. <lb/> He moved to and fro with unequal steps, and with
                        <lb/> gesticulations, that possessed a horrible but indistinct <reg
                            orig="sig-|nificance">significance</reg>. <lb/> Occasionally he
                        struggled for breath, and his <lb/> efforts were directed to remove some
                        choking impediment.</p>
                    <p>No test of my fortitude had hitherto occurred equal to <lb/> that to which it
                        was now subjected. The suspicion which <lb/> this deportment suggested was
                        vague and formless. The <lb/> tempest which I witnessed was the prelude of
                        horror. These <lb/> were throes which would terminate in the birth of some
                        <lb/> gigantic and sanguinary purpose. Did he meditate to offer <lb/> a
                        bloody sacrifice? Was his own death or was mine to <lb/> attest the
                        magnitude of his despair, or the impetuosity of <lb/> his vengeance?</p>
                    <p>Suicide was familiar to his thoughts. He had consented <lb/> to live but on
                        one condition; that of regaining possession of <lb/> this money. Should I be
                        justified in driving him, by my <lb/> obstinate refusal, to this fatal
                        consummation of his crimes? <lb/> Yet my fear of this catastrophe was
                        groundless. Hitherto <lb/> he had argued and persuaded, but this method was
                        pursued <lb/> because it was more eligible than the employment of force,
                        <lb/> or than procrastination.</p>
                    <p>No. These were tokens that pointed to me. Some <reg orig="un-|known"
                            >unknown</reg>
                        <lb/> instigation was at work within him, to tear away his <lb/> remnant of
                        humanity, and fit him for the office of my <reg orig="mur-|derer"
                            >murderer</reg>. <lb/> I knew not how the accumulation of guilt could
                        <lb/> contribute to his gratification or security. His actions had <lb/>
                        been partially exhibited and vaguely seen. What <reg orig="extenua-|tions"
                            >extenuations</reg>
                        <lb/> or omissions had vitiated his former or recent narrative; <lb/>
                        <pb n="188" entity="eaf033v2_0201" pid="uva-lib:349508"/> how far his actual
                        performances were congenial with the <lb/> deed which was now to be
                        perpetrated, I knew not.</p>
                    <p>These thoughts lent new rapidity to my blood. I raised <lb/> my head from the
                        pillow, and watched the deportment of <lb/> this man, with deeper attention.
                        The paroxysm which <reg orig="con-|troled">controled</reg>
                        <lb/> him, at length, in some degree subsided. He <reg orig="mut-|tered"
                            >muttered</reg>, <lb/> Yes. It must come. My last humiliation must cover
                        <lb/> me. My last confession must be made. To die, and <lb/> leave behind me
                        this train of enormous perils, must not be.</p>
                    <p>O Clemenza! O Mervyn! Ye have not merited that I <lb/> should leave you a
                        legacy of persecution and death. Your <lb/> safety must be purchased at what
                        price my malignant destiny <lb/> will set upon it. The cord of the
                        executioner, the note of <lb/> everlasting infamy, is better than to leave
                        you beset by the <lb/> consequences of my guilt. It must not be.</p>
                    <p>Saying this, Welbeck cast fearful glances at the windows <lb/> and door. He
                        examined every avenue and listened. Thrice <lb/> he repeated this scrutiny.
                        Having, as it seemed, <reg orig="ascer-|tained">ascertained</reg>
                        <lb/> that no one lurked within audience, he approached <lb/> the bed. He
                        put his mouth close to my face. He <reg orig="at-|tempted">attempted</reg>
                        <lb/> to speak, but once more examined the apartment <lb/> with suspicious
                        glances.</p>
                    <p>He drew closer, and at length, in a tone, scarcely <reg orig="articu-|late"
                            >articulate</reg>
                        <lb/> and suffocated with emotion, he spoke. Excellent but <lb/> fatally
                        obstinate youth! Know at least the cause of my <reg orig="im-|portunity"
                            >importunity</reg>. <lb/> Know at least the depth of my infatuation and
                        <lb/> the enormity of my guilt.</p>
                    <p>The bills&mdash;Surrender them to me, and save yourself from <lb/>
                        persecution and disgrace. Save the woman whom you <lb/> wish to benefit,
                        from the blackest imputations; from hazard <lb/> to her life and her fame;
                        from languishing in dungeons; <lb/> from expiring on the gallows!</p>
                    <p>The bills&mdash;O save me from the bitterness of death. Let <lb/> the evils,

                    <p>There he stopped. His utterance was choked by terror. <lb/> Rapid glances
                        were again darted at the windows and door. <lb/> The silence was
                        uninterrupted except by far-off sounds, <lb/> produced by some moving
                        carriage. Once more, he <reg orig="sum-|moned">summoned</reg>
                        <lb/> resolution, and spoke:</p>
                    <p>Surrender them to me&mdash;for&mdash;<hi rend="italic">they are

                    <p>Formerly I told you, that a scheme of forgery had been <lb/> conceived. Shame
                        would not suffer me to add, that my <lb/> scheme was carried into execution.
                        The bills were <reg orig="fashion-|ed">fashioned</reg>, <lb/> but my fears
                        contended against my necessities, and <reg orig="for-|bade">forbade</reg>
                        <lb/> me to attempt to exchange them. The interview with <lb/> Lodi saved me
                        from the dangerous experiment. I enclosed <lb/> them in that volume, as the
                        means of future opulence, to be <lb/> used when all other, and less
                        hazardous resources should <lb/> fail.</p>
                    <p>In the agonies of my remorse, at the death of Watson, <lb/> they were
                        forgotten. They afterwards recurred to <reg orig="recollec-|tion"
                            >recollection</reg>. <lb/> My wishes pointed to the grave; but the
                        stroke that <lb/> should deliver me from life, was suspended only till I
                        could <lb/> hasten hither, get possession of these papers, and destroy <lb/>
                        them.</p>
                    <p>When I thought upon the chances that should give them <lb/> an owner; bring
                        them into circulation; load the innocent <lb/> with suspicion; and lead them
                        to trial, and, perhaps, to <lb/> death, my sensations were fraught with
                        agony; earnestly as <lb/> I panted for death, it was necessarily deferred
                        till I had <lb/> gained possession of and destroyed these papers.</p>
                    <p>What now remains? You have found them. Happily <lb/> they have not been used.
                        Give them, therefore, to me, that <lb/> I may crush at once the brood of
                        mischiefs which they could <lb/> not but generate.</p>
                    <p>This disclosure was strange. It was accompanied with <lb/> every token of
                        sincerity. How had I tottered on the brink <lb/> of destruction! If I had
                        made use of this money, in what <lb/> a labyrinth of misery might I not have
                        been involved! My <lb/> innocence could never have been proved. An alliance
                        with <lb/> Welbeck could not have failed to be inferred. My career <lb/>
                        would have found an ignominious close; or, if my <reg orig="punish-|ment"
                            >punishment</reg>
                        <lb/> had been transmuted into slavery and toil, would the <lb/> testimony
                        of my conscience have supported me?</p>
                    <p>I shuddered at the view of those disasters from which I <lb/> was rescued by
                        the miraculous chance which led me to this <lb/> house. Welbeck's request
                        was salutary to me, and <reg orig="honor-|able">honorable</reg>
                        <lb/> to himself. I could not hesitate a moment in compliance. <lb/> The
                        notes were enclosed in paper, and deposited in a fold <lb/> of my clothes. I
                        put my hand upon them.</p>
                    <p>My motion and attention was arrested at the instant, by <lb/>
                        <pb n="190" entity="eaf033v2_0203" pid="uva-lib:349510"/> a noise which
                        arose in the street. Footsteps were heard <lb/> upon the pavement before the
                        door, and voices, as if busy <lb/> in discourse. This incident was adapted
                        to infuse the <reg orig="deep-|est">deepest</reg>
                        <lb/> alarm into myself and my companion. The motives of <lb/> our
                        trepidation were, indeed, different, and were infinitely <lb/> more powerful
                        in my case than in his. It portended to me <lb/> nothing less than the loss
                        of my asylum, and condemnation <lb/> to a hospital.</p>
                    <p>Welbeck hurried to the door, to listen to the conversation <lb/> below. This
                        interval was pregnant with thought. That <lb/> impulse which led my
                        reflections from Welbeck to my own <lb/> state, passed away in a moment, and
                        suffered me to meditate <lb/> anew upon the terms of that confession which
                        had just been <lb/> made.</p>
                    <p>Horror at the fate which this interview had enabled me <lb/> to shun, was
                        uppermost in my conceptions. I was eager to <lb/> surrender these fatal
                        bills. I held them for that purpose in <lb/> my hand, and was impatient for
                        Welbeck's return. He <reg orig="con-|tinued">continued</reg>
                        <lb/> at the door; stooping, with his face averted, and <lb/> eagerly
                        attentive to the conversation in the street.</p>
                    <p>All the circumstances of my present situation tended to <lb/> arrest the
                        progress of thought, and chain my contemplations <lb/> to one image; but
                        even now there was room for foresight <lb/> and deliberation. Welbeck
                        intended to destroy these bills. <lb/> Perhaps he had not been sincere; or,
                        if his purpose had <lb/> been honestly disclosed, this purpose might change
                        when <lb/> the bills were in his possession. His poverty and <reg
                            orig="sanguine-|ness">sanguineness</reg>
                        <lb/> of temper, might prompt him to use them.</p>
                    <p>That this conduct was evil and would only multiply his <lb/> miseries, could
                        not be questioned. Why should I subject his <lb/> frailty to this
                        temptation? The destruction of these bills was <lb/> the loudest injunction
                        of my duty; was demanded by every <lb/> sanction which bound me to promote
                        the welfare of <reg orig="man-|kind">mankind</reg>.</p>
                    <p>The means of destruction were easy. A lighted candle <lb/> stood on a table,
                        at the distance of a few yards. Why <lb/> should I hesitate a moment to
                        annihilate so powerful a cause <lb/> of error and guilt. A passing instant
                        was sufficient. A <lb/> momentary lingering might change the circumstances
                        that <lb/> surrounded me, and frustrate my project.</p>
                    <p>My languors were suspended by the urgencies of this <lb/>
                        <pb n="191" entity="eaf033v2_0204" pid="uva-lib:349511"/> occasion. I
                        started from my bed and glided to the table. <lb/> Seizing the notes with my
                        right hand, I held them in the <lb/> flame of the candle, and then threw
                        them, blazing, on the <lb/> floor.</p>
                    <p>The sudden illumination was perceived by Welbeck. <lb/> The cause of it
                        appeared to suggest itself as soon. He <reg orig="turn-|ed">turned</reg>,
                        <lb/> and marking the paper where it lay, leaped to the spot, <lb/> and
                        extinguished the fire with his foot. His interposition <lb/> was too late.
                        Only enough of them remained to inform him <lb/> of the nature of the
                        sacrifice.</p>
                    <p>Welbeck now stood, with limbs trembling, features aghast, <lb/> and eyes
                        glaring upon me. For a time he was without <lb/> speech. The storm was
                        gathering in silence, and at length <lb/> burst upon me. In a tone menacing
                        and loud, he exclaimed:</p>
                    <p>Wretch! What have you done?</p>
                    <p>I have done justly. These notes were false. You desired <lb/> to destroy them
                        that they might not betray the innocent. I <lb/> applauded your purpose, and
                        have saved you from the <reg orig="dan-|ger">danger</reg>
                        <lb/> of temptation by destroying them myself.</p>
                    <p>Maniac! Miscreant! To be fooled by so gross an artifice! <lb/> The notes were
                        genuine. The tale of their forgery was false <lb/> and meant only to wrest
                        them from you. Execrable and <lb/> perverse idiot! Your deed has sealed my
                        perdition. It has <lb/> sealed your own. You shall pay for it with your
                        blood. I <lb/> will slay you by inches. I will stretch you as you have <lb/>
                        stretched me, on the rack.</p>
                    <p>During this speech, all was frenzy and storm in the <reg orig="coun-|tenance"
                            >countenance</reg>
                        <lb/> and features of Welbeck. Nothing less could be <lb/> expected than
                        that the scene would terminate in some bloody <lb/> catastrophe. I bitterly
                        regretted the facility with which I <lb/> had been deceived, and the
                        precipitation of my sacrifice. <lb/> The act, however lamentable, could not
                        be revoked. What <lb/> remained, but to encounter or endure its consequences
                        with <lb/> unshrinking firmness?</p>
                    <p>The contest was too unequal. It is possible that the <lb/> frenzy which
                        actuated Welbeck might have speedily <reg orig="sub-|sided">subsided</reg>.
                        <lb/> It is more likely that his passions would have been <lb/> satiated
                        with nothing but my death. This event was <reg orig="pre-|cluded"
                            >precluded</reg>
                        <lb/> by loud knocks at the street door, and calls by some <lb/> one on the
                        pavement without, of&mdash;Who is within? Is any <lb/> one within?</p>
                    <pb n="192" entity="eaf033v2_0205" pid="uva-lib:349512"/>
                    <p>These noises gave a new direction to Welbeck's thoughts. <lb/> They are
                        coming said he. They will treat you as a sick <lb/> man and a thief. I
                        cannot desire you to suffer a worse evil <lb/> than they will inflict. I
                        leave you to your fate. So saying, <lb/> he rushed of the room.</p>
                    <p>Though confounded and stunned by this rapid succession <lb/> of events, I was
                        yet able to pursue measures for eluding <lb/> these detested visitants. I
                        first extinguished the light, and <lb/> then, observing that the parley in
                        the street continued and <lb/> grew louder, I sought an asylum in the
                        remotest corner of <lb/> the house. During my former abode here, I noticed,
                        that a <lb/> trap door opened in the ceiling of the third story, to which
                        <lb/> you were conducted by a moveable stair or ladder. I <reg
                            orig="con-|sidered">considered</reg>
                        <lb/> that this, probably, was an opening into a narrow <lb/> and darksome
                        nook, formed by the angle of the roof. By <lb/> ascending, drawing after me
                        the ladder, and closing the door, <lb/> I should escape the most vigilant
                        search.</p>
                    <p>Enfeebled as I was by my disease, my resolution rendered <lb/> me strenuous.
                        I gained the uppermost room, and <reg orig="mount-|ing">mounting</reg>
                        <lb/> the ladder, found myself at a sufficient distance from <lb/>
                        suspicion. The stair was hastily drawn up, and the door <lb/> closed. In a
                        few minutes, however, my new retreat proved <lb/> to be worse than any for
                        which it was possible to change <lb/> it. The air was musty, stagnant, and
                        scorchingly hot. My <lb/> breathing became difficult, and I saw that to
                        remain here <lb/> ten minutes, would unavoidably produce suffocation.</p>
                    <p>My terror of intruders had rendered me blind to the <reg
                            orig="con-|sequences">consequences</reg>
                        <lb/> of immuring myself in this cheerless recess. It <lb/> was incumbent on
                        me to extricate myself as speedily as <lb/> possible. I attempted to lift
                        the door. My first effort was <lb/> successless. Every inspiration was
                        quicker, and more <reg orig="diffi-|cult">difficult</reg>
                        <lb/> that the former. As my terror, so my strength and <lb/> my exertions
                        increased. Finally my trembling hand lighted <lb/> on a nail that was
                        imperfectly driven into the wood, and <lb/> which by affording me a firmer
                        hold, enabled me at length <lb/> to raise it, and to inhale the air from
                        beneath.</p>
                    <p>Relieved from my new peril, by this situation, I bent an <lb/> attentive ear
                        through the opening with a view to ascertain if <lb/> the house had been
                        entered or if the outer door was still <lb/> beset, but could hear nothing.
                        Hence I was authorized to <lb/>
                        <pb n="193" entity="eaf033v2_0206" pid="uva-lib:349513">

                        </pb> conclude, that the people had departed, and that I might <lb/> resume
                        my former station without hazard.</p>
                    <p>Before I descended, however, I cast a curious eye over <lb/> this recess. It
                        was large enough to accommodate a human <lb/> being. The means by which it
                        was entered were easily <reg orig="con-|cealed">concealed</reg>. <lb/>
                        Though narrow and low, it was long, and were it <lb/> possible to contrive
                        some inlet for the air, one studious of <lb/> concealment, might rely on its
                        protection with unbounded <lb/> confidence.</p>
                    <p>My scrutiny was imperfect by reason of the faint light <lb/> which found its
                        way through the opening, yet it was sufficient <lb/> to set me afloat on a
                        sea of new wonders and subject my <lb/> fortitude to a new test.&mdash;</p>
                    <p>Here Mervyn paused in his narrative. A minute passed <lb/> in silence and
                        seeming indecision. His perplexities <reg orig="gradu-|ally">gradually</reg>
                        <lb/> disappeared and he continued.</p>
                    <p>I have promised to relate the momentous incidents of <lb/> my life, and have
                        hitherto been faithful in my enumeration. <lb/> There is nothing which I
                        more detest than equivocation <lb/> and mystery. Perhaps, however, I shall
                        now incur some <lb/> imputation of that kind. I would willingly escape the
                            <reg orig="accu-|sation">accusation</reg>, <lb/> but confess that I am
                        hopeless of escaping it.</p>
                    <p>I might indeed have precluded your guesses and surmises <lb/> by omitting to
                        relate what befel me from the time of my <lb/> leaving my chamber till I
                        regained it. I might deceive you <lb/> by asserting that nothing remarkable
                        occurred, but this <lb/> would be false, and every sacrifice is trivial
                        which is made <lb/> upon the altar of sincerity. Besides, the time may come
                        <lb/> when no inconvenience will arise from minute descriptions <lb/> of the
                        objects which I now saw and of the reasonings and <lb/> inferences which
                        they suggested to my understanding. At <lb/> present, it appears to be my
                        duty to pass them over in silence, <lb/> but it would be needless to conceal
                        from you that the <reg orig="inter-|val">interval</reg>, <lb/> though short,
                        and the scrutiny, though hasty, furnished <lb/> matter which my curiosity
                        devoured with unspeakable <reg orig="eager-|ness">eagerness</reg>, <lb/> and
                        from which consequences may hereafter flow, <reg orig="de-|ciding"

                    <p>Nothing however occurred which could detain me long in <lb/> this spot. I
                        once more sought the lower story and threw <lb/> myself on the bed which I

                        <pb n="194" entity="eaf033v2_0207" pid="uva-lib:349514"/> with the images
                        flowing from my late adventure. My <lb/> fever had gradually increased, and
                        my thoughts were <reg orig="de-|formed">deformed</reg>
                        <lb/> by inaccuracy and confusion.</p>
                    <p>My heart did not sink when I reverted to my own <reg orig="condi-|tion"
                            >condition</reg>. <lb/> That I should quickly be disabled from moving,
                        was <lb/> readily perceived. The foresight of my destiny was <reg
                            orig="stead-|fast">steadfast</reg>
                        <lb/> and clear. To linger for days in this comfortless <reg
                            orig="soli-|tude">solitude</reg>, <lb/> to ask in vain, not for powerful
                        restoratives or <reg orig="allevi-|ating">alleviating</reg>
                        <lb/> cordials, but for water to moisten my burning lips, and <lb/> abate
                        the torments of thirst; ultimately, to expire in <reg orig="tor-|por"
                            >torpor</reg>
                        <lb/> or frenzy, was the fate to which I looked forward, yet <lb/> I was not
                        terrified. I seemed to be sustained by a <reg orig="preter-|natural"
                            >preternatural</reg>
                        <lb/> energy. I felt as if the opportunity of combating <lb/> such evils was
                        an enviable privilege, and though none would <lb/> witness my victorious
                        magnanimity, yet to be conscious that <lb/> praise was my due, was all that
                        my ambition required.</p>
                    <p>These sentiments were doubtless tokens of delirium. The <lb/> excruciating
                        agonies which now seized upon my head, and <lb/> the cord which seemed to be
                        drawn across my breast, and <lb/> which, as my fancy imagined, was tightened
                        by some forcible <lb/> hand, with a view to strangle me, were imcompatible
                        with <lb/> sober and coherent views.</p>
                    <p>Thirst was the evil which chiefly oppressed me. The <lb/> means of relief
                        were pointed out by nature and habit. I <lb/> rose and determined to
                        replenish my pitcher at the well. <lb/> It was easier, however, to descend
                        than to return. My <lb/> limbs refused to bear me and I sat down upon the
                        lower step <lb/> of the staircase. Several hours had elapsed since my <lb/>
                        entrance into this dwelling, and it was now night.</p>
                    <p>My imagination now suggested a new expedient. <reg orig="Medli-|cote"
                            >Medlicote</reg>
                        <lb/> was a generous and fearless spirit. To put myself <lb/> under his
                        protection, if I could walk as far as his lodgings, <lb/> was the wisest
                        proceeding which I could adopt. From this <lb/> design, my incapacity to
                        walk thus far, and the consequences <lb/> of being discovered in the street,
                        had hitherto deterred me. <lb/> These impediments were now, in the confusion
                        of my <reg orig="under-|standing">understanding</reg>, <lb/> overlooked or
                        despised, and I forthwith set out <lb/> upon this hopeless expedition.</p>
                    <p>The doors communicating with the court, and through the <lb/> court, with the
                        street, were fastened by inside bolts. These <lb/> were easily withdrawn,
                        and I issued forth with alacrity and <lb/>
                        <pb n="195" entity="eaf033v2_0208" pid="uva-lib:349515"/> confidence. My
                        perturbed senses and the darkness hindered <lb/> me from discerning the
                        right way. I was conscious of this <lb/> difficulty, but was not
                        disheartened. I proceeded, as I have <lb/> since discovered, in a direction
                        different from the true, but <lb/> hesitated not, till my powers were
                        exhausted, and I sunk <lb/> upon the ground. I closed my eyes, and dismissed
                        all fear, <lb/> and all foresight of futurity. In this situation I remained
                        <lb/> some hours, and should probably have expired on this spot, <lb/> had
                        not I attracted your notice, and been provided under <lb/> this roof, with
                        all that medical skill, that the tenderest <reg orig="human-|ity"
                            >humanity</reg>
                        <lb/> could suggest.</p>
                    <p>In consequence of your care, I have been restored to life <lb/> and to
                        health. Your conduct was not influenced by the <lb/> prospect of pecuniary
                        recompense, of service, or of <reg orig="grat-|itude">gratitude</reg>. <lb/>
                        It is only in one way that I am able to heighten <lb/> the gratification
                        which must flow from reflection on your <reg orig="con-|duct&mdash;by"
                            >conduct&mdash;by</reg>
                        <lb/> shewing that the being whose life you have <lb/> prolonged, though
                        uneducated, ignorant and poor, is not <lb/> profligate and worthless, and
                        will not dedicate that life which <lb/> your bounty has given, to
                        mischievous or contemptible <lb/> purposes.</p>

                <head type="sub">CHAPTER XXIV.</head>
                <p><hi rend="small-caps">Here</hi> ended the narrative of Mervyn. Surely its <reg
                        orig="inci-|dents">incidents</reg>
                    <lb/> were of no common kind. During this season of <lb/> pestilence, my
                    opportunities of observation had been <reg orig="nume-|rous">numerous</reg>,
                    <lb/> and I had not suffered them to pass unimproved. <lb/> The occurrences
                    which fell within my own experience, bore <lb/> a general resemblance to those
                    which had just been related, <lb/> but they did not hinder the latter from
                    striking on my mind <lb/> with all the force of novelty. They served no end, but
                    as <lb/> vouchers for the truth of the tale.</p>
                <p>Surely the youth had displayed inimitable and heroic <lb/> qualities. His courage
                    was the growth of benevolence and <lb/> reason, and not the child of
                    insensibility and the nursling <lb/> of habit. He had been qualified for the
                    encounter of gigantic <lb/> dangers by no laborious education. He stepped forth
                    <lb/> upon the stage, unfurnished, by anticipation or experience, <lb/> with the
                    means of security against fraud; and yet, by the <lb/> aid of pure intentions,
                    had frustrated the wiles of an <reg orig="accom-|plished">accomplished</reg>
                    <lb/> and veteran deceiver.</p>
                <p>I blessed the chance which placed the youth under my <lb/> protection. When I
                    reflected on that tissue of nice <reg orig="con-|tingencies">contingencies</reg>
                    <lb/> which led him to my door, and enabled me to <lb/> save from death a being
                    of such rare endowments, my <lb/> heart overflowed with joy, not unmingled with
                    regrets and <lb/> trepidation. How many have been cut off by this disease, <lb/>
                    <pb n="4" entity="eaf033v2_0213" pid="uva-lib:349520"/> in their career of
                    virtue and their blossom time of genius! <lb/> How many deeds of heroism and
                    self-devotion are ravished <lb/> from existence, and consigned to hopeless
                    oblivion!</p>
                <p>I had saved the life of this youth. This was not the <lb/> limit of my duty or my
                    power. Could I not render that <lb/> life profitable to himself and to mankind?
                    The gains of <lb/> my profession were slender; but these gains were sufficient
                    <lb/> for his maintenance as well as my own. By residing with <lb/> me,
                    partaking my instructions, and reading my books, he <lb/> would, in a few years,
                    be fitted for the practice of physic. <lb/> A science, whose truths are so
                    conducive to the welfare of <lb/> mankind, and which comprehends the whole
                    system of <reg orig="na-|ture">nature</reg>, <lb/> could not but gratify a mind
                    so beneficent and <reg orig="strenu-|ous">strenuous</reg>
                    <lb/> as his.</p>
                <p>This scheme occurred to me as soon as the conclusion of <lb/> his tale allowed me
                    to think. I did not immediately <reg orig="men-|tion">mention</reg>
                    <lb/> it, since the approbation of my wife, of whose <reg orig="concur-|rence"
                        >concurrence</reg>, <lb/> however, I entertained no doubt, was previously to
                    <lb/> be obtained. Dismissing it, for the present, from my <lb/> thoughts, I
                    reverted to the incidents of his tale.</p>
                <p>The lady whom Welbeck had betrayed and deserted, <lb/> was not unknown to me. I
                    was but too well acquainted <lb/> with her fate. If she had been single in
                    calamity, her tale <lb/> would have been listened to with insupportable
                    sympathy; <lb/> but the frequency of the spectacle of distress, seems to <reg
                        orig="les-|sen">lessen</reg>
                    <lb/> the compassion with which it is reviewed. Now that <lb/> those scenes are
                    only remembered, my anguish is greater <lb/> than when they were witnessed. Then
                    every new day <lb/> was only a repetition of the disasters of the foregoing. My
                    <lb/> sensibility, if not extinguished, was blunted; and I gazed <lb/> upon the
                    complicated ills of poverty and sickness with a <lb/> degree of unconcern, on
                    which I should once have reflected <lb/> with astonishment.</p>
                <p>The fate of Clemenza Lodi was not, perhaps, more signal <lb/> than many which
                    have occurred. It threw detestable light <lb/> upon the character of Welbeck,
                    and showed him to be more <lb/> inhuman than the tale of Mervyn had evinced him
                    to be. <lb/> That man, indeed, was hitherto imperfectly seen. The <lb/> time had
                    not come which should fully unfold the enormity <lb/> of his transgressions, and
                    the complexity of his frauds.</p>
                <pb n="5" entity="eaf033v2_0214" pid="uva-lib:349521"/>
                <p>There lived in a remote quarter of the city, a woman, by <lb/> name Villars, who
                    passed for the widow of an English <lb/> officer. Her manners and mode of living
                    were specious. <lb/> She had three daughters, well trained in the school of
                    <lb/> fashion, and elegant in person, manners, and dress. They <lb/> had lately
                    arrived from Europe, and for a time, received <lb/> from their neighbors that
                    respect to which their education <lb/> and fortune appeared to lay claim.</p>
                <p>The fallacy of their pretensions slowly appeared. It began <lb/> to be suspected
                    that their subsistence was derived not from <lb/> pension or patrimony, but from
                    the wages of pollution. <lb/> Their habitation was clandestinely frequented by
                    men who <lb/> were unfaithful to their secret; one of these was allied to <lb/>
                    me by ties, which authorized me in watching his steps and <lb/> detecting his
                    errors, with a view to his reformation. From <lb/> him I obtained a knowledge of
                    the genuine character of <lb/> these women.</p>
                <p>A man like Welbeck, who was the slave of depraved <lb/> appetites, could not fail
                    of being quickly satiated with <reg orig="inno-|cence">innocence</reg>
                    <lb/> and beauty. Some accident introduced him to the <lb/> knowledge of this
                    family, and the youngest daughter found <lb/> him a proper subject on which to
                    exercise her artifices. It <lb/> was to the frequent demands made upon his
                    purse, by this <lb/> woman, that part of the embarrassments in which Mervyn
                    <lb/> found him involved, are to be ascribed.</p>
                <p>To this circumstance must likewise be imputed his <reg orig="anxi-|ety"
                        >anxiety</reg>
                    <lb/> to transfer to some other the possession of the unhappy <lb/> stranger.
                    Why he concealed from Mervyn his connexion <lb/> with Lucy Villars, may be
                    easily imagined. His silence, <lb/> with regard to Clemenza's asylum, will not
                    create surprise, <lb/> when it is told that she was placed with Mrs. Villars. On
                    <lb/> what conditions she was received under this roof, cannot be <lb/> so
                    readily conjectured. It is obvious, however, to suppose, <lb/> that advantage
                    was to be taken of her ignorance and <reg orig="weak-|ness">weakness</reg>,
                    <lb/> and that they hoped, in time, to make her an associate <lb/> in their
                    profligate schemes.</p>
                <p>The appearance of pestilence, meanwhile, threw them <lb/> into panic, and they
                    hastened to remove from danger. Mrs. <lb/> Villars appears to have been a woman
                    of no ordinary views. <lb/> She stooped to the vilest means of amassing money;
                    but <lb/> this money was employed to secure to herself and her <lb/>
                    <pb n="6" entity="eaf033v2_0215" pid="uva-lib:349522"/> daughters the benefits
                    of independence. She purchased <lb/> the house which she occupied in the city,
                    and a mansion in <lb/> the environs, well built and splendidly furnished. To the
                    <lb/> latter, she and her family, of which the Italian girl was now <lb/> a
                    member, retired at the close of July.</p>
                <p>I have mentioned that the source of my intelligence was <lb/> a kinsman, who had
                    been drawn from the paths of sobriety <lb/> and rectitude, by the impetuosity of
                    youthful passions. He <lb/> had power to confess and deplore, but none to repair
                    his <lb/> errors. One of these women held him by a spell which <lb/> he
                    struggled in vain to dissolve, and by which, in spite of <lb/> resolutions and
                    remorses, he was drawn to her feet, and <lb/> made to sacrifice to her pleasure,
                    his reputation and his <lb/> fortune.</p>
                <p>My house was his customary abode during those intervals <lb/> in which he was
                    persuaded to pursue his profession. Some <lb/> time before the infection began
                    its progress, he had <reg orig="disap-|peared">disappeared</reg>. <lb/> No
                    tidings were received of him, till a messenger <lb/> arrived, entreating my
                    assistance. I was conducted to the <lb/> house of Mrs. Villars, in which I found
                    no one but my <reg orig="kins-|man">kinsman</reg>. <lb/> Here it seems he had
                    immured himself from my <lb/> inquiries, and on being seized by the reigning
                    malady, had <lb/> been deserted by the family, who, ere they departed, <reg
                        orig="in-|formed">informed</reg>
                    <lb/> me by a messenger of his condition.</p>
                <p>Despondency combined with his disease to destroy him. <lb/> Before he died, he
                    informed me fully of the character of <lb/> his betrayers. The late arrival,
                    name, and personal <reg orig="condi-|tion">condition</reg>
                    <lb/> of Clemenza Lodi were related. Welbeck was not <lb/> named, but was
                    described in terms, which, combined with <lb/> the narrative of Mervyn, enabled
                    me to recognise the <reg orig="par-|amour">paramour</reg>
                    <lb/> of Lucy Villars in the man whose crimes had been <lb/> the principal theme
                    of our discourse.</p>
                <p>Mervyn's curiosity was greatly roused when I intimated <lb/> my acquaintance with
                    the fate of Clemenza. In answer to <lb/> his eager interrogations, I related
                    what I knew. The tale <lb/> plunged him into reverie. Recovering, at length,
                    from his <lb/> thoughtfulness, he spoke.</p>
                <p>Her condition is perilous. The poverty of Welbeck will <lb/> drive him far from
                    her abode. Her profligate protectors <lb/> will entice her or abandon her to
                    ruin. Cannot she be <lb/> saved?</p>
                <pb n="7" entity="eaf033v2_0216" pid="uva-lib:349523"/>
                <p>I know not, answered I, by what means.</p>
                <p>The means are obvious. Let her remove to some other <lb/> dwelling. Let her be
                    apprized of the vices of those who <lb/> surround her. Let her be entreated to
                    fly. The will need <lb/> only be inspired, the danger need only be shown, and
                    she is <lb/> safe, for she will remove beyond its reach.</p>
                <p>Thou art an adventurous youth. Who wilt thou find to <lb/> undertake the office?
                    Who will be persuaded to enter the <lb/> house of a stranger, seek without an
                    introduction the <reg orig="pre-|sence">presence</reg>
                    <lb/> of this girl, tell her that the house she inhabits is a <lb/> house of
                    prostitution, prevail on her to believe the tale, and <lb/> persuade her to
                    accompany him? Who will open his house <lb/> to the fugitive? Whom will you
                    convince that her illicit <reg orig="in-|tercourse">intercourse</reg>
                    <lb/> with Welbeck, of which the opprobrious tokens <lb/> cannot be concealed,
                    has not fitted her for the company of <lb/> prostitutes, and made her unworthy
                    of protection? Who <lb/> will adopt into their family, a stranger, whose conduct
                    has <lb/> incurred infamy, and whose present associates have, no <lb/> doubt,
                    made her worthy of the curse?</p>
                <p>True. These are difficulties which I did not foresee. <lb/> Must she then perish!
                    Shall not something be done to <lb/> rescue her from infamy and guilt?</p>
                <p>It is neither in your power nor in mine to do any thing.</p>
                <p>The lateness of the hour put an end to our conversation <lb/> and summoned us to
                    repose. I seized the first opportunity <lb/> of imparting to my wife the scheme
                    which had occurred, <lb/> relative to our guest; with which, as I expected, she
                    readily <lb/> concurred. In the morning, I mentioned it to Mervyn. I <lb/> dwelt
                    upon the benefits that adhered to the medical <reg orig="profes-|sion"
                        >profession</reg>, <lb/> the power which it confers of lightening the
                    distresses of <lb/> our neighbors, the dignity which popular opinion annexes to
                    <lb/> it, the avenue which it opens to the acquisition of <reg
                        orig="compe-|tence">competence</reg>, <lb/> the freedom from servile cares
                    which attends it, and <lb/> the means of intellectual gratification with which
                    it <reg orig="sup-|plies">supplies</reg>
                    <lb/> us.</p>
                <p>As I spoke, his eyes sparkled with joy. Yes, said he <lb/> with vehemence, I
                    willingly embrace your offer. I accept <lb/> this benefit, because I know that
                    if my pride should refuse <lb/> it, I should prove myself less worthy than you
                    think, and <lb/> give you pain, instead of that pleasure which I am bound to
                    <lb/> confer. I would enter on the duties and studies of my new <lb/>
                    <pb n="8" entity="eaf033v2_0217" pid="uva-lib:349524"/> profession immediately,
                    but somewhat is due to Mr. <reg orig="Had-|win">Hadwin</reg>
                    <lb/> and his daughters. I cannot vanquish my inquietudes <lb/> respecting them,
                    but by returning to Malverton and <reg orig="ascer-|taining">ascertaining</reg>
                    <lb/> their state with my own eyes. You know in what <lb/> circumstances I
                    parted with Wallace and Mr. Hadwin. I <lb/> am not sure, that either of them
                    ever reached home, or that <lb/> they did not carry the infection along with
                    them. I now <lb/> find myself sufficiently strong to perform the journey, and
                    <lb/> purposed to have acquainted you, at this interview, with my <lb/>
                    intentions. An hour's delay is superfluous, and I hope you <lb/> will consent to
                    my setting out immediately. Rural <reg orig="exer-|cise">exercise</reg>
                    <lb/> and air, for a week or fortnight, will greatly contribute <lb/> to my
                    health.</p>
                <p>No objection could be made to this scheme. His <reg orig="nar-|rative"
                        >narrative</reg>
                    <lb/> had excited no common affection in our bosoms for <lb/> the Hadwins. His
                    visit could not only inform us of their <lb/> true state, but would dispel that
                    anxiety which they could <lb/> not but entertain respecting our guest. It was a
                    topic of <lb/> some surprise that neither Wallace nor Hadwin had returned <lb/>
                    to the city, with a view to obtain some tidings of their <lb/> friend. It was
                    more easy to suppose them to have been <reg orig="de-|tained">detained</reg>
                    <lb/> by some misfortune, than by insensibility or indolence. <lb/> In a few
                    minutes Mervyn bade us adieu, and set out upon <lb/> his journey, promising to
                    acquaint us with the state of affairs, <lb/> as soon as possible after his
                    arrival. We parted from him <lb/> with reluctance, and found no consolation but
                    in the prospect <lb/> of his speedy return.</p>
                <p>During his absence, conversation naturally turned upon <lb/> those topics which
                    were suggested by the narrative and <reg orig="de-|portment">deportment</reg>
                    <lb/> of this youth. Different conclusions were formed <lb/> by his two
                    auditors. They had both contracted a deep <reg orig="in-|terest">interest</reg>
                    <lb/> in his welfare, and an ardent curiosity as to those <reg
                        orig="par-|ticulars">particulars</reg>
                    <lb/> which his unfinished story had left in obscurity. <lb/> The true character
                    and actual condition of Welbeck, were <lb/> themes of much speculation. Whether
                    he were dead or <lb/> alive, near or distant from his ancient abode, was a point
                    on <lb/> which neither Mervyn, nor any of those with whom I had <lb/> means of
                    intercourse, afforded any information. Whether <lb/> he had shared the common
                    fate, and had been carried by <lb/> the collectors of the dead from the highway
                    or the hovel to <lb/> the pits opened alike for the rich and the poor, the known <lb/>
                    <pb n="9" entity="eaf033v2_0218" pid="uva-lib:349525">

                    </pb> and the unknown; whether he had escaped to a foreign <lb/> shore, or were
                    destimed to reappear upon this stage, were <lb/> questions involved in
                    uncertainty.</p>
                <p>The disappearance of Watson would, at a different time, <lb/> have excited much
                    inquiry and suspicion; but as this had <lb/> taken place on the eve of the
                    epidemic, his kindred and <lb/> friends would acquiesce, without scruple, in the
                    belief that <lb/> he had been involved in the general calamity, and was to be
                    <lb/> numbered amongst the earliest victims. Those of his <reg
                        orig="pro-|fession">profession</reg>
                    <lb/> usually resided in the street where the infection <reg orig="be-|gan"
                        >began</reg>, <lb/> and where its ravages had been most destructive; and
                    <lb/> this circumstance would corroborate the conclusions of his <lb/>
                    friends.</p>
                <p>I did not perceive any immediate advantage to flow from <lb/> imparting the
                    knowledge I had lately gained to others. <lb/> Shortly after Mervyn's departure
                    to Malverton, I was visited <lb/> by Wortley. Inquiring for my guest, I told him
                    that, having <lb/> recovered his health, he had left my house. He repeated <lb/>
                    his invectives against the villany of Welbeck, his suspicions <lb/> of Mervyn,
                    and his wishes for another interview with the <lb/> youth. Why had I suffered
                    him to depart, and whither <lb/> had he gone?</p>
                <p>He has gone for a short time into the country. I expect <lb/> him to return in
                    less than a week, when you will meet with <lb/> him here as often as you please,
                    for I expect him to take up <lb/> his abode in this house.</p>
                <p>Much astonishment and disapprobation were expressed <lb/> by my friend. I hinted
                    that the lad had made disclosures <lb/> to me, which justified my confidence in
                    his integrity. These <lb/> proofs of his honesty were not of a nature to be <reg
                        orig="indiscrimi-|nately">indiscriminately</reg>
                    <lb/> unfolded. Mervyn had authorized me to <reg orig="communi-|cate"
                        >communicate</reg>
                    <lb/> so much of his story to Wortley, as would serve to <reg orig="vin-|dicate"
                        >vindicate</reg>
                    <lb/> him from the charge of being Welbeck's copartner in <lb/> fraud; but this
                    end would only be counteracted by an <reg orig="im-|perfect">imperfect</reg>
                    <lb/> tale, and the full recital, though it might exculpate <lb/> Mervyn, might
                    produce inconveniences by which this <reg orig="advan-|tage">advantage</reg>
                    <lb/> would be outweighed.</p>
                <p>Wortley, as might be naturally expected, was by no <lb/> means satisfied with
                    this statement. He suspected that <lb/> Mervyn was a wily imposter; that he had
                    been trained in <lb/>
                    <pb n="10" entity="eaf033v2_0219" pid="uva-lib:349526"/> the arts of fraud,
                    under an accomplished teacher; that the <lb/> tale which he had told to me, was
                    a tissue of ingenious and <lb/> plausible lies; that the mere assertions,
                    however plausible <lb/> and solemn, of one like him, whose conduct had incurred
                    <lb/> such strong suspicions, were unworthy of the least credit.</p>
                <p>It cannot be denied, continued my friend, that he lived <lb/> with Welbeck at the
                    time of his clopement; that they <reg orig="disap-|peared">disappeared</reg>
                    <lb/> together; that they entered a boat, at Pine-street <lb/> wharf, at
                    midnight; that this boat was discovered by the <lb/> owner in the possession of
                    a fisherman at Red-bank, who <lb/> affirmed that he had found it stranded near
                    his door, the day <lb/> succeeding that on which they disappeared. Of all this,
                    I <lb/> can supply you with incontestible proof. If, after this proof, <lb/> you
                    can give credit to his story, I shall think you made of <lb/> very perverse and
                    credulous materials.</p>
                <p>The proof you mention, said I, will only enhance his <lb/> credibility. All the
                    facts which you have stated, have been <lb/> admitted by him. They constitute an
                    essential portion of <lb/> his narrative.</p>
                <p>What then is the inference? Are not these evidences <lb/> of a compact between
                    them? Has he not acknowledged <lb/> this compact in confessing that he knew
                    Welbeck was my <lb/> debtor; that he was apprized of his flight, but that, (what
                    <lb/> matchless effrontery!) he had promised secrecy, and would, <lb/> by no
                    means, betray him? You say he means to return; <lb/> but of that I doubt. You
                    will never see his face more. He <lb/> is too wise to thrust himself again into
                    the noose; but I do <lb/> not utterly despair of lighting upon Welbeck. Old <reg
                        orig="Thet-|ford">Thetford</reg>, <lb/> Jamieson and I, have sworn to hunt
                    him through the <lb/> world. I have strong hopes that he has not strayed far.
                    <lb/> Some intelligence has lately been received, which has <reg
                        orig="ena-|bled">enabled</reg>
                    <lb/> us to place our hounds upon the scent. He may <lb/> double and skulk; but
                    if he does not fall into our toils at <lb/> last, he will have the agility and
                    cunning, as well as the <lb/> malignity of devils.</p>
                <p>The vengeful disposition thus betrayed by Wortley, was <lb/> not without excuse.
                    The vigor of his days had been spent <lb/> in acquiring a slender capital; his
                    diligence and honesty <lb/> had succeeded, and he had lately thought his
                    situation such <lb/> as to justify marriage with an excellent woman, to whom
                    <lb/> he had for years been betrothed, but from whom his <lb/>
                    <pb n="11" entity="eaf033v2_0220" pid="uva-lib:349527"/> poverty had hitherto
                    compelled him to live separate. <lb/> Scarcely had this alliance taken place,
                    and the full career <lb/> of nuptial enjoyments begun, when his ill fate exposed
                    him <lb/> to the frauds of Welbeck, and brought him, in one evil <lb/> hour, to
                    the brink of insolvency.</p>
                <p>Jamieson and Thetford, however, were rich, and I had <lb/> not till now been
                    informed that they had reasons for <reg orig="pur-|suing">pursuing</reg>
                    <lb/> Welbeck with peculiar animosity. The latter was the <lb/> uncle of him
                    whose fate had been related by Mervyn, and <lb/> was one of those who employed
                    money, not as the medium <lb/> of traffic, but as in itself a commodity. He had
                    neither <lb/> wines nor cloths, to transmute into silver. He thought it <lb/> a
                    tedious process to exchange to day, one hundred dollars <lb/> for a cask or
                    bale, and tomorrow exchange the bale or <lb/> cask for one hundred <hi
                        rend="italic">and ten</hi> dollars. It was better to give <lb/> the hundred
                    for a piece of paper, which, carried forthwith <lb/> to the money changers, he
                    could procure a hundred <lb/> twenty-three and three-fourths. In short, this
                    man's coffers <lb/> were supplied by the despair of honest men and the <reg
                        orig="strata-|gems">stratagems</reg>
                    <lb/> of rogues. I did not immediately suspect how this <lb/> man's prudence and
                    indefatigable attention to his own <reg orig="inte-|rest">interest</reg>
                    <lb/> should allow him to become the dupe of Welbeck.</p>
                <p>What, said I, is old Thetford's claim upon Welbeck?</p>
                <p>It is a claim, he replied, that, if it ever be made good, <lb/> will doom Welbeck
                    to imprisonment and wholesome labor <lb/> for life.</p>
                <p>How? Surely it is nothing more than debt.</p>
                <p>Have you not heard? But that is no wonder. Happily <lb/> you are a stranger to
                    mercantile anxieties and revolutions. <lb/> Your fortune does not rest on a
                    basis which an untoward <lb/> blast may sweep away, or four strokes of a pen may
                        <reg orig="de-|molish">demolish</reg>. <lb/> That hoary dealer in suspicions

                <p><hi rend="small-caps">While</hi> musing upon these facts, I could not but reflect
                    <lb/> with astonishment on the narrow escapes which Mervyn's <lb/> virtue had
                    experienced. I was by no means certain that <lb/> his fame or his life was
                    exempt from all danger, or that the <lb/> suspicions which had already been
                    formed respecting him, <lb/> could possibly be wiped away. Nothing but his own
                        <reg orig="nar-|rative">narrative</reg>, <lb/> repeated with that simple but
                    nervous eloquence, <lb/> which we had witnessed, could rescue him from the most
                    <lb/> heinous charges. Was there any tribunal that would not <lb/> acquit him on
                    merely hearing his defence?</p>
                <p>Surely the youth was honest. His tale could not be the <lb/> fruit of invention;
                    and yet, what are the bounds of fraud? <lb/> Nature has set no limits to the
                    combinations of fancy. A <lb/> smooth exterior, a show of virtue, and a specious
                    tale, are, <lb/> a thousand times, exhibited in human intercourse by craft <lb/>
                    and subtlety. Motives are endlessly varied, while actions <lb/> continue the
                    same; and an acute penetration may not find <lb/> it hard to select and arrange
                    motives, suited to exempt from <lb/> censure any action that a human being can
                    commit.</p>
                <p>Had I heard Mervyn's story from another, or read it in <lb/> a book, I might,
                    perhaps, have found it possible to suspect <lb/> the truth; but, as long as the
                    impression, made by his tones, <lb/> gestures and looks, remained in my memory,
                    this <reg orig="suspi-|cion">suspicion</reg>

                        >Mervyn</reg>
                    <lb/> is the index of an honest mind. Calm or vehement, <lb/> doubting or
                    confident, it is full of benevolence and candor. <lb/> He that listens to his
                    words may question their truth, but he <lb/> that looks upon his countenance
                    when speaking, cannot <lb/> withhold his faith.</p>
                <p>It was possible, however, to find evidence, supporting or <lb/> confuting his
                    story. I chanced to be acquainted with a <lb/> family, by name Althorpe, who
                    were natives of that part of <lb/> the country where his father resided. I paid
                    them a visit, <lb/> and, after a few preliminaries, mentioned, as if by
                    accident, <lb/> the name of Mervyn. They immediately recognised this <lb/> name
                    as belonging to one of their ancient neighbors. The <lb/> death of the wife and
                    sons, and the seduction of the only <lb/> daughter by Colvill, with many
                    pathetic incidents connected <lb/> with the fate of this daughter, were
                    mentioned.</p>
                <p>This intelligence induced me to inquire of Mrs. Althorpe, <lb/> a sensible and
                    candid woman, if she were acquainted with <lb/> the recent or present situation
                    of this family.</p>
                <p>I cannot say much, she answered, of my own knowledge. <lb/> Since my marriage, I
                    am used to spend a few weeks of <lb/> summer, at my father's, but am less
                    inquisitive than I once <lb/> was into the concerns of my old neighbors. I
                    recollect, <lb/> however, when there, last year, during <hi rend="italic">the
                        fever,</hi> to have <lb/> heard that Sawny Mervyn had taken a second wife;
                    that <lb/> his only son, a youth of eighteen, had thought proper to be <lb/>
                    highly offended with his father's conduct, and treated the <lb/> new mistress of
                    the house with insult and contempt. I <lb/> should not much wonder at this,
                    seeing children are so apt <lb/> to deem themselves unjustly treated by a second
                    marriage <lb/> of their parent, but it was hinted that the boy's jealousy and
                    <lb/> discontent was excited by no common cause. The new <lb/> mother was not
                    much older than himself, had been a <reg orig="ser-|vant">servant</reg>
                    <lb/> of the family, and a criminal intimacy had subsisted <lb/> between her,
                    while in that condition, and the son. Her <lb/> marriage with his father was
                    justly accounted by their <reg orig="neigh-|bors">neighbors</reg>, <lb/> a most
                    profligate and odious transaction. The son, <lb/> perhaps, had, in such a case,
                    a right to scold, but he ought <lb/>
                    <pb n="14" entity="eaf033v2_0223" pid="uva-lib:349530"/> not to have carried his
                    anger to such extremes as have been <lb/> imputed to him. He is said to have
                    grinned upon her with <lb/> contempt, and even to have called her <hi
                        rend="italic">strumpet</hi> in the <reg orig="pre-|sence">presence</reg>
                    <lb/> of his father and of strangers.</p>
                <p>It was impossible for such a family to keep together. <lb/> Arthur took leave one
                    night to possess himself of all his <lb/> father's cash, mount the best horse in
                    his meadow, and <lb/> elope. For a time, no one knew whither he had gone. <lb/>
                    At last, one was said to have met with him in the streets <lb/> of this city,
                    metamorphosed from a rustic lad into a fine <lb/> gentleman. Nothing could be
                    quicker than this change, for <lb/> he left the country on a Saturday morning,
                    and was seen <lb/> in a French frock and silk stockings, going into Christ's
                    <lb/> Church the next day. I suppose he kept it up with a high <lb/> hand, as
                    long as his money lasted.</p>
                <p>My father paid us a visit last week, and among other <lb/> country news, told us
                    that Sawny Mervyn had sold his <lb/> place. His wife had persuaded him to try
                    his fortune in <lb/> the Western Country. The price of his hundred acres here
                    <lb/> would purchase a thousand there, and the man being very <lb/> gross and
                    ignorant, and withal, quite a simpleton, found no <lb/> difficulty in perceiving
                    that a thousand are ten times more <lb/> than a hundred. He was not aware that a
                    rood of ground <lb/> upon Schuylkill is tenfold better than an acre on the <lb/>
                    Tennessee.</p>
                <p>The woman turned out to be an artful profligate. Having <lb/> sold his ground and
                    gotten his money, he placed it in her <lb/> keeping, and she, to enjoy it with
                    the more security, ran <lb/> away to the city; leaving him to prosecute his
                    journey to <lb/> Kentucky, moneyless and alone. Sometime after, Mr <reg
                        orig="Al-|thorpe">Althorpe</reg>
                    <lb/> and I were at the play, when he pointed out to me <lb/> a group of females
                    in an upper box, one of whom was no <lb/> other than Betty Lawrence. It was not
                    easy to recognise, <lb/> in her present gaudy trim, all flaunting with ribbons
                    and <lb/> shining with trinkets the same Betty who used to deal out <lb/> pecks
                    of potatoes and superintend her basket of cantilopes in <lb/> the Jersey market,
                    in pasteboard bonnet and linsey petticoat. <lb/> Her companions were of the
                    infamous class. If Arthur <lb/> were still in the city, there is no doubt that
                    the mother and <lb/> son might renew the ancient terms of their
                    acquaintance.</p>
                <p>The old man thus robbed and betrayed, sought <reg orig="consola-|tion"
                        >consolation</reg>
                    <lb/>
                    <pb n="15" entity="eaf033v2_0224" pid="uva-lib:349531"/> in the bottle, of which
                    he had been at all times over fond. <lb/> He wandered from one tavern to another
                    till his credit was <lb/> exhausted, and then was sent to jail, where, I
                    believe, he is <lb/> likely to continue till his death. Such, my friend, is the
                    <lb/> history of the Mervyns.</p>
                <p>What proof, said I, have you of the immoral conduct of <lb/> the son? Of his
                    mistreatment of his mother, and his <reg orig="elope-|ment">elopement</reg>
                    <lb/> with his father's horse and money?</p>
                <p>I have no proof but the unanimous report of Mervyn's <lb/> neighbors. Respectable
                    and honest men have affirmed, in <lb/> my hearing, that they had been present
                    when the boy treated <lb/> his mother in the way that I have described. I was,
                    besides, <lb/> once in company with the old man, and heard him bitterly <lb/>
                    inveigh against his son, and charge him with the fact of <reg orig="steal-|ing"
                        >stealing</reg>
                    <lb/> his horse and money. I well remember that tears rolled <lb/> from his eyes
                    while talking on the subject. As to his being <lb/> seen in the city the next
                    day after his elopement, dressed in <lb/> a most costly and fashionable manner,
                    I can doubt that as <lb/> little as the rest, for he that saw him was my father,
                    and you <lb/> who know my father, know what credit is due to his eyes <lb/> and
                    his word. He had seen Arthur often enough not to be <lb/> mistaken, and
                    described his appearance with great exactness. <lb/> The boy is extremely
                    handsome, give him his due; his dark <lb/> hazle eyes, auburn hair, and very
                    elegant proportions. His <lb/> air and gate have nothing of the clown in them.
                    Take <lb/> away his jacket and trowsers, and you have as spruce a <reg
                        orig="fel-|low">fellow</reg>
                    <lb/> as ever came from dancing-school or college. He is <lb/> the exact picture
                    of his mother, and the most perfect <reg orig="con-|trast">contrast</reg>
                    <lb/> to the sturdy legs, squat figure, and broad, unthinking, <lb/> sheepish
                    face of the father that can be imagined. You must <lb/> confess that his
                    appearance here is a pretty strong proof of <lb/> the father's assertions. The
                    money given for these clothes <lb/> could not possibly have been honestly
                    acquired. It is to be <lb/> presumed that they were bought or stolen, for how
                    else <lb/> should they have been gotten?</p>
                <p>What was this lad's personal deportment during the life <lb/> of his mother, and
                    before his father's second marriage?</p>
                <p>Very little to the credit of his heart or his intellects. <lb/> Being the
                    youngest son, the only one who at length survived, <lb/> and having a powerful
                    resemblance to herself, he became <lb/> the mother's favorite. His constitution
                    was feeble, and he <lb/>
                    <pb n="16" entity="eaf033v2_0225" pid="uva-lib:349532"/> loved to stroll in the
                    woods more than to plough or sow. <lb/> This idleness was much against his
                    father's inclination and <lb/> judgment; and, indeed, it was the foundation of
                    all his vices. <lb/> When he could be prevailed upon to do any thing it was in
                    <lb/> a bungling manner, and so as to prove that his thoughts <lb/> were fixed
                    on any thing except his business. When his <reg orig="as-|sistance"
                        >assistance</reg>
                    <lb/> was wanted he was never to be found at hand. <lb/> They were compelled to
                    search for him among the rocks <lb/> and bushes, and he was generally discovered
                    sauntering <lb/> along the bank of the river, or lolling in the shade of a tree.
                    <lb/> This disposition to inactivity and laziness, in so young a man, <lb/> was
                    very strange. Persons of his age are rarely fond of <lb/> work, but then they
                    are addicted to company, and sports, <lb/> and exercises. They ride, or shoot,
                    or frolic; but this being <lb/> moped away his time in solitude, never
                    associated with other <lb/> young people, never mounted a horse but when he
                    could <lb/> not help it, and never fired a gun or angled for a fish in his <lb/>
                    life. Some people supposed him to be half an idiot, or, at <lb/> least, not to
                    be right in his mind; and, indeed, his conduct <lb/> was so very perverse and
                    singular, that I do not wonder at <lb/> those who accounted for it in this
                    way.</p>
                <p>But, surely, said I, he had some object of pursuit. <reg orig="Per-|haps"
                        >Perhaps</reg>
                    <lb/> he was addicted to books.</p>
                <p>Far from it. On the contrary, his aversion to school was <lb/> as great as his
                    hatred of the plough. He never could get <lb/> his lessons or bear the least
                    constraint. He was so much <lb/> indulged by his mother at home, that tasks and
                    discipline of <lb/> any kind were intolerable. He was a perpetual truant; till
                    <lb/> the master one day attempting to strike him, he ran out of <lb/> the room
                    and never entered it more. The mother excused <lb/> and countenanced his
                    frowardness, and the foolish father was <lb/> obliged to give way. I do not
                    believe he had two month's <lb/> schooling in his life.</p>
                <p>Perhaps, said I, he preferred studying by himself, and at <lb/> liberty. I have
                    known boys endowed with great curiosity <lb/> and aptitude to learning, who
                    never could endure set tasks, <lb/> and spurned at the pedagogue and his
                    rod.</p>
                <p>I have known such likewise, but this was not one of them. <lb/> I know not whence
                    he could derive his love of knowledge <lb/> or the means of acquiring it. The
                    family were totally <lb/> illiterate. The father was a Scotch peasant, whose
                        <reg orig="igno-|rance">ignorance</reg>
                    <lb/>
                    <pb n="17" entity="eaf033v2_0226" pid="uva-lib:349533"/> was so great that he
                    could not sign his name. His <lb/> wife, I believe, could read, and might
                    sometimes decypher <lb/> the figures in an almanac, but that was all. I am apt
                    to <lb/> think, that the son's ability was not much greater. You <lb/> might as
                    well look for silver platters or marble tables in his <lb/> house, as for a book
                    or a pen.</p>
                <p>I remember calling at their house one evening in the <lb/> winter before last. It
                    was intensely cold; and my father, <lb/> who rode with me, having business with
                    Sawny Mervyn, we <lb/> stopped a minute at his gate; and, while the two old men
                    <lb/> were engaged in conversation, I begged leave to warm <reg orig="my-|self"
                        >myself</reg>
                    <lb/> by the kitchen fire. Here, in the chimney corner, seated <lb/> on a block,
                    I found Arthur busily engaged in <hi rend="italic">knitting <reg
                            orig="stock-|ings">stockings</reg>!</hi>
                    <lb/> I thought this a whimsical employment for a young <lb/> active man. I told
                    him so, for I wanted to put him to the <lb/> blush; but he smiled in my face,
                    and answered, without the <lb/> least discomposure, just as whimsical a business
                    for a young <lb/> active woman. Pray, did you never knit a stocking?</p>
                <p>Yes; but that was from necessity. Were I of a different <lb/> sex, or did I
                    possess the strength of a man, I should rather <lb/> work in my field or study
                    my book.</p>
                <p>Rejoice that you are a woman, then, and are at liberty to <lb/> pursue that which
                    costs least labor and demands most skill. <lb/> You see, though a man, I use
                    your privilege, and prefer <lb/> knitting yarn to threshing my brain with a book
                    or the barn <lb/> floor with a flail.</p>
                <p>I wonder, said I contemptuously, you do not put on the <lb/> petticoat as well as
                    handle the needle.</p>
                <p>Do not wonder, he replied; it is because I hate a <reg orig="petti-|coat"
                        >petticoat</reg>
                    <lb/> incumbrance as much as I love warm feet. Look there <lb/> (offering the
                    stocking to my inspection) is it not well done?</p>
                <p>I did not touch it, but sneeringly said, excellent! I wonder <lb/> you do not
                    apprentice yourself to a tailor.</p>
                <p>He looked at me with an air of ridiculous simplicity, and <lb/> said, how prone
                    the woman is to <hi rend="italic">wonder.</hi> You call the <lb/> work
                    excellent, and yet <hi rend="italic">wonder</hi> that I do not make myself <lb/>
                    a slave to improve my skill! Did you learn needle work <lb/> from seven year's
                    squatting on a tailor's board? Had you <lb/> come to me, I would have taught you
                    in a day.</p>
                <p>I was taught at school.</p>
                <p>And paid your instructer?</p>
                <pb n="18" entity="eaf033v2_0227" pid="uva-lib:349534"/>
                <p>To be sure.</p>
                <p>'Twas liberty and money thrown away. Send your sister, <lb/> if you have one, to
                    me, and I will teach her without either <lb/> rod or wages. Will you?</p>
                <p>You have an old and a violent antipathy, I believe, to any <lb/> thing like a
                    school.</p>
                <p>True. It was early and violent. Had not you?</p>
                <p>No. I went to school with pleasure; for I thought to <lb/> read and write were
                    accomplishments of some value.</p>
                <p>Indeed? Then I misunderstood you just now. I thought <lb/> you said, that, had
                    you the strength of a man, you should <lb/> prefer the plough and the hook to
                    the needle. Whence, <reg orig="sup-|posing">supposing</reg>
                    <lb/> you a female, I inferred that you had a woman's love <lb/> for the needle
                    and a fool's hatred of books.</p>
                <p>My father calling me from without, I now made a motion <lb/> to go. Stay,
                    continued he with great earnestness, throwing <lb/> aside his knitting
                    apparatus, and beginning in great haste to <lb/> pull off his stockings. Draw
                    these stockings over your shoes. <lb/> They will save your feet from the snow
                    while walking to <lb/> your horse.</p>
                <p>Half angry, and half laughing, I declined the offer. He <lb/> had drawn them off,
                    however, and holding them in his hand, <lb/> be persuaded, said he; only lift
                    your feet, and I will slip <lb/> them on in a trice.</p>
                <p>Finding me positive in my refusal, he dropped the <reg orig="stock-|ings"
                        >stockings</reg>; <lb/> and, without more ado, caught me up in his arms,
                    <lb/> rushed out of the room, and, running barefoot through the <lb/> snow, set
                    me fairly on my horse. All was done in a <reg orig="mo-|ment">moment</reg>,
                    <lb/> and before I had time to reflect on his intentions. <lb/> He then seized
                    my hand, and, kissing it with great fervor, <lb/> exclaimed, a thousand thanks
                    to you for not accepting my <lb/> stockings. You have thereby saved yourself and
                    me the <lb/> time and toil of drawing on and drawing off. Since you have <lb/>
                    taught me to wonder, let me practise the lesson in <reg orig="wonder-|ing"
                        >wondering</reg>
                    <lb/> at your folly, in wearing worsted shoes and silk <reg orig="stock-|ings"
                        >stockings</reg>
                    <lb/> at a season like this. Take my counsel, and turn your <lb/> silk to
                    worsted and your worsted to leather. Then may <lb/> you hope for warm feet and
                    dry. What! Leave the gate <lb/> without a blessing on your counsellor?</p>
                <p>I spurred my horse into a gallop, glad to escape from <lb/>
                    <pb n="19" entity="eaf033v2_0228" pid="uva-lib:349535"/> so strange a being. I
                    could give you many instances of <lb/> behaviour equally singular, and which
                    betrayed a mixture of <lb/> shrewdness and folly, of kindness and impudence,
                    which <lb/> justified, perhaps, the common notion that his intellects were <lb/>
                    unsound. Nothing was more remarkable than his <reg orig="impene-|trability"
                        >impenetrability</reg>
                    <lb/> to ridicule and censure. You might revile him for <lb/> hours, and he
                    would listen to you with invincible composure. <lb/> To awaken anger or shame in
                    him was impossible. He <lb/> would answer, but in such a way as to show him
                    totally <lb/> unaware of your true meaning. He would afterwards talk <lb/> to
                    you with all the smiling affability and freedom of an old <lb/> friend. Every
                    one despised him for his idleness and folly, <lb/> no less conspicuous in his
                    words than his actions; but no <lb/> one feared him, and few were angry with
                    him, till after the <lb/> detection of his commerce with <hi rend="italic"
                        >Betty,</hi> and his inhuman <lb/> treatment of his father.</p>
                <p>Have you good reasons for supposing him to have been <lb/> illicitly connected
                    with that girl?</p>
                <p>Yes. Such as cannot be discredited. It would not be <lb/> proper for me to state
                    these proofs. Nay, he never denied <lb/> it. When reminded, on one occasion, of
                    the inference <lb/> which every impartial person would draw from appearances,
                    <lb/> he acknowledged, with his usual placid effrontery, that the <lb/>
                    inference was unavoidable. He even mentioned other <reg orig="con-|curring"
                        >concurring</reg>
                    <lb/> and cotemporary incidents, which had eluded the <lb/> observation of his
                    censurer, and which added still more <lb/> force to the conclusion. He was
                    studious to palliate the <lb/> vices of this woman, as long as he was her only
                    paramour; <lb/> but after her marriage with his father, the tone was <lb/>
                    changed. He confessed that she was tidy, notable, <reg orig="indus-|trious"
                        >industrious</reg>; <lb/> but, then, she was a prostitute, When charged with
                    <lb/> being instrumental in making her such, and when his <reg
                        orig="com-|panions">companions</reg>
                    <lb/> dwelt upon the depravity of reviling her for vices <lb/> which she owed to
                    him: True, he would say, there is <reg orig="de-|pravity">depravity</reg>
                    <lb/> and folly in the conduct you describe. Make me <lb/> out, if you please,
                    to be a villain. What then? I was <lb/> talking, not of myself, but of Betty.
                    Still this woman is a <lb/> prostitute. If it were I that made her such, with
                    more <lb/> confidence may I make the charge. But think not that I <lb/> blame
                    Betty. Place me in her situation, and I should have <lb/> acted just so. I
                    should have formed just such notions of <lb/>
                    <pb n="20" entity="eaf033v2_0229" pid="uva-lib:349536"/> my interest, and
                    pursued it by the same means. Still, say <lb/> I, I would fain have a different
                    woman for my father's wife, <lb/> and the mistress of his family.</p>

                <p><hi rend="small-caps">This</hi> conversation was interrupted by a messenger from
                    <lb/> my wife, who desired my return immediately. I had some <lb/> hopes of
                    meeting with Mervyn, some days having now <lb/> elapsed since his parting from
                    us, and not being conscious <lb/> of any extraordinary motives for delay. It was
                    Wortley, <lb/> however, and not Mervyn, to whom I was called.</p>
                <p>My friend came to share with me his suspicions and <reg orig="in-|quietudes"
                        >inquietudes</reg>
                    <lb/> respecting Welbeck and Mervyn. An accident <lb/> had newly happened which
                    had awakened these suspicions <lb/> afresh. He desired a patient audience while
                    he explained <lb/> them to me. These were his words.</p>
                <p>To day a person presented me a letter from a mercantile <lb/> friend at
                    Baltimore. I easily discerned the bearer to be a <lb/> sea captain. He was a man
                    of sensible and pleasing aspect, <lb/> and was recommended to my friendship and
                    counsel in the <lb/> letter which he brought. The letter stated, that a man, by
                    <lb/> name Amos Watson, by profession a mariner, and a resident <lb/> at
                    Baltimore, had disappeared in the summer of last year, <lb/> in a mysterious and
                    incomprehensible manner. He was <lb/> known to have arrived in this city from
                    Jamaica, and to <lb/> have intended an immediate journey to his family, who
                    lived <lb/> at Baltimore; but he never arrived there, and no trace of <lb/> his
                    existence has since been discovered. The bearer had <lb/> come to investigate,
                    if possible, the secret of his fate, and I <lb/> was earnestly entreated to
                    afford him all the assistance and <lb/> advice in my power, in the prosecution
                    of his search. I <lb/> expressed my willingness to serve the stranger, whose
                    name <lb/> was Williams; and, after offering him entertainment at my <lb/>
                    house, which was thankfully accepted, he proceeded to <lb/> unfold to me the
                    particulars of this affair. His story was <lb/> this.</p>

                </pb>
                <p>On the 20th of last June, I arrived, said he, from the <lb/> West Indies, in
                    company with Captain Watson. I <reg orig="com-|manded">commanded</reg>
                    <lb/> the ship in which he came as a passenger, his own <lb/> ship being taken
                    and confiscated by the English. We had <lb/> long lived in habits of strict
                    friendship, and I loved him for <lb/> his own sake, as well as because he had
                    married my sister. <lb/> We landed in the morning, and went to dine with Mr.
                    <lb/> Keysler, since dead, but who then lived in Water-street. <lb/> He was
                    extremely anxious to visit his family, and having a <lb/> few commissions to
                    perform in the city, which would not <lb/> demand more than a couple of hours,
                    he determined to set <lb/> out next morning in the stage. Meanwhile, I had <reg
                        orig="engage-|ments">engagements</reg>
                    <lb/> which required me to repair with the utmost <reg orig="expedi-|tion"
                        >expedition</reg>
                    <lb/> to New York. I was scarcely less anxious than my <lb/> brother to reach
                    Baltimore, where my friends also reside, <lb/> but there was an absolute
                    necessity of going eastward. I <lb/> expected, however, to return hither in
                    three days, and then <lb/> to follow Watson home. Shortly after dinner we
                    parted; <lb/> he to execute his commissions, and I to embark in the mail <lb/>
                    stage.</p>
                <p>In the time prefixed I returned. I arrived early in the <lb/> morning, and
                    prepared to depart again at noon. <reg orig="Mean-|while">Meanwhile</reg>, <lb/>
                    I called at Keysler's. This is an old acquaintance of <lb/> Watson's and mine;
                    and, in the course of talk, he <reg orig="express-|ed">expressed</reg>
                    <lb/> some surprise that Watson had so precipitately deserted <lb/> his house. I
                    stated the necessity there was for Watson's <lb/> immediate departure <hi
                        rend="italic">southward,</hi> and added, that no doubt <lb/> my brother had
                    explained this necessity.</p>
                <p>Why, said Keysler, it is true, Captain Watson mentioned <lb/> his intention of
                    leaving town early next day; but then he <lb/> gave me reason to expect that he
                    would sup and lodge with <lb/> me that night, whereas he has not made his
                    appearance <lb/> since. Besides, his trunk was brought to my house. This, <lb/>
                    no doubt, he intended to carry home with him, but here it <lb/> remains still.
                    It is not likely that in the hurry of departure <lb/> his baggage was forgotten.
                    Hence, I inferred that he was <lb/> still in town, and have been puzzling myself
                    these three <lb/> days with conjectures, as to what is become of him. What <lb/>
                    surprises me more is, that, on inquiring among the few <lb/> friends which he
                    has in this city, I find them as ignorant of <lb/>
                    <pb n="22" entity="eaf033v2_0231" pid="uva-lib:349538"/> his motions as myself.
                    I have not, indeed, been wholly <lb/> without apprehensions that some accident
                    or other has <reg orig="be-|fallen">befallen</reg>
                    <lb/> him.</p>
                <p>I was not a little alarmed by this intimation. I went <reg orig="my-|self"
                        >myself</reg>, <lb/> agreeably to Keysler's directions, to Watson's friends,
                    <lb/> and made anxious inquiries, but none of them had seen my <lb/> brother
                    since his arrival. I endeavored to recollect the <lb/> commissions which he
                    designed to execute, and, if possible, <lb/> to trace him to the spot where he
                    last appeared. He had <lb/> several packets to deliver, one of which was
                    addressed to <lb/> Walter Thetford. Him, after some inquiry, I found out, <lb/>
                    but unluckily he chanced to be in the country. I found, by <lb/> questioning a
                    clerk, who transacted his business in his <reg orig="ab-|sence">absence</reg>,
                    <lb/> that a person, who answered the minute description <lb/> which I gave of
                    Watson, had been there on the day on <lb/> which I parted with him, and had left
                    papers relative to the <lb/> capture of one of Thetford's vessels by the
                    English. This <lb/> was the sum of the information he was able to afford me.</p>
                <p>I then applied to three merchants for whom my brother <lb/> had letters. They all
                    acknowledged the receipt of these <lb/> letters, but they were delivered through
                    the medium of the <lb/> post-office.</p>
                <p>I was extremely anxious to reach home. Urgent <reg orig="en-|gagements"
                        >engagements</reg>
                    <lb/> compelled me to go on without delay. I had <lb/> already exhausted all the
                    means of inquiry within my reach, <lb/> and was obliged to acquiesce in the
                    belief, that Watson had <lb/> proceeded homeward at the time appointed, and
                    left, by <lb/> forgetfulness or accident, his trunk behind him. On <reg
                        orig="exam-|ining">examining</reg>
                    <lb/> the books kept at the stage offices, his name no where <lb/> appeared, and
                    no conveyance by water had occurred during <lb/> the last week. Still the only
                    conjecture I could form, was <lb/> that he had gone homeward.</p>
                <p>Arriving at Baltimore, I found that Watson had not yet <lb/> made his appearance.
                    His wife produced a letter, which, <lb/> by the post mark, appeared to have been
                    put into the office <lb/> at Philadelphia, on the morning after our arrival, and
                    on <lb/> which he had designed to commence his journey. This <lb/> letter had
                    been written by my brother, in my presence, but <lb/> I had dissuaded him from
                    sending it, since the same coach <lb/> that should bear the letter, was likewise
                    to carry himself. I <lb/> had seen him put it unwafered in his pocket-book, but
                    this <lb/>
                    <pb n="23" entity="eaf033v2_0232" pid="uva-lib:349539"/> letter, unaltered in
                    any part, and containing money which he <lb/> had at first intended to enclose
                    in it, was now conveyed to <lb/> his wife's hand. In this letter he mentioned
                    his design of <lb/> setting out for Baltimore, on the <hi rend="italic"
                        >twenty-first,</hi> yet, on that <lb/> day the letter itself had been put
                    into the office.</p>
                <p>We hoped that a short time would clear up this mystery, <lb/> and bring the
                    fugitive home, but from that day till the present, <lb/> no atom of intelligence
                    has been received concerning him. <lb/> The yellow fever, which quickly
                    followed, in this city, and <lb/> my own engagements, have hindered me, till
                    now, from <lb/> coming hither and resuming the search.</p>
                <p>My brother was one of the most excellent of men. His <lb/> wife loved him to
                    distraction, and, together with his children, <lb/> depended for subsistence
                    upon his efforts. You will not, <lb/> therefore, be surprised that his
                    disappearance excited, in us, <lb/> the deepest consternation and distress; but
                    I have other, and <lb/> peculiar reasons for wishing to know his fate. I gave
                    him <lb/> several bills of exchange on merchants of Baltimore, which <lb/> I had
                    received in payment of my cargo, in order that they <lb/> might, as soon as
                    possible, be presented and accepted. <lb/> These have disappeared with the
                    bearer. There is likewise <lb/> another circumstance that makes his existence of
                    no small <lb/> value.</p>
                <p>There is an English family, who formerly resided in <lb/> Jamaica, and possessed
                    an estate of great value, but who, <lb/> for some years, have lived in the
                    neighborhood of Baltimore. <lb/> The head of this family died a year ago, and
                    left a widow <lb/> and three daughters. The lady thought it eligible to sell
                    <lb/> her husband's property in Jamaica, the island becoming <lb/> hourly more
                    exposed to the chances of war and revolution, <lb/> and transfer it to the
                    United States, where she purposes <lb/> henceforth to reside. Watson had been
                    her husband's <lb/> friend, and his probity and disinterestedness being well
                    <lb/> known, she entrusted him with legal powers to sell this estate. <lb/> This
                    commission was punctually performed, and the <reg orig="pur-|chase"
                        >purchase</reg>
                    <lb/> money was received. In order to confer on it the <lb/> utmost possible
                    security, he rolled up four bills of exchange, <lb/> drawn upon opulent
                    merchants of London, in a thin sheet of <lb/> lead, and depositing this roll in
                    a leathern girdle, fastened it <lb/> round his waist, and under his clothes; a
                    second set he gave <lb/> to me, and a third he despatched to Mr. Keysler, by a
                    vessel <lb/>
                    <pb n="24" entity="eaf033v2_0233" pid="uva-lib:349540"/> which sailed a few days
                    before him. On our arrival in this <lb/> city, we found that Keysler had
                    received those transmitted <lb/> to him, and which he had been charged to keep
                    till our <lb/> arrival. They were now produced, and, together with those <lb/>
                    which I had carried, were delivered to Watson. By him <lb/> they were joined to
                    those in the girdle, which he still wore, <lb/> conceiving this method of
                    conveyance to be safer than any <lb/> other, and, at the same time, imagining it
                    needless, in so <lb/> short a journey as remained to be performed, to resort to
                    <lb/> other expedients.</p>
                <p>The sum which he thus bore about him, was no less than <lb/> ten thousand pounds
                    sterling. It constituted the whole <reg orig="patri-|mony">patrimony</reg>
                    <lb/> of a worthy and excellent family, and the loss of it <lb/> reduces them to
                    beggary. It is gone with Watson, and <lb/> whither Watson has gone, it is
                    impossible even to guess.</p>
                <p>You may now easily conceive, Sir, the dreadful disasters <lb/> which may be
                    connected with this man's fate, and with what <lb/> immeasurable anxiety his
                    family and friends have regarded <lb/> his disappearance. That he is alive, can
                    scarcely be <reg orig="believ-|ed">believed</reg>, <lb/> for in what situation
                    could he be placed in which he <lb/> would not be able and willing to
                    communicate some tidings <lb/> of his fate to his family?</p>
                <p>Our grief has been unspeakably aggravated by the <reg orig="sus-|picions"
                        >suspicions</reg>
                    <lb/> which Mrs. Maurice and her friends have allowed <lb/> themselves to admit.
                    They do not scruple to insinuate, <lb/> that Watson, tempted by so great a
                    prize, has secretly <reg orig="em-|barked">embarked</reg>
                    <lb/> for England, in order to obtain payment for these <lb/> bills, and retain
                    the money for his own use.</p>
                <p>No man was more impatient of poverty than Watson, <lb/> but no man's honesty was
                    more inflexible. He murmured <lb/> at the destiny that compelled him to
                    sacrifice his ease, and <lb/> risk his life upon the ocean in order to procure
                    the means <lb/> of subsistence; and all the property which he had spent the
                    <lb/> best part of his life in collecting, had just been ravished <lb/> away
                    from him by the English; but if he had yielded to <lb/> this temptation at any
                    time, it would have been on receiving <lb/> these bills at Jamaica. Instead of
                    coming hither, it would <lb/> have been infinitely more easy and convenient to
                    have <reg orig="em-|barked">embarked</reg>
                    <lb/> directly for London; but none, who thoroughly knew <lb/> him, can, for a
                    moment, harbor a suspicion of his truth.</p>
                <p>If he be dead, and if the bills are not to be recovered, <lb/>
                    <pb n="25" entity="eaf033v2_0234" pid="uva-lib:349541">

                    </pb> yet, to ascertain this, will, at least, serve to vindicate his <lb/>
                    character. As long as his fate is unknown, his fame will be <lb/> loaded with
                    the most flagrant imputations, and if these bills <lb/> be ever paid in London,
                    these imputations will appear to be <lb/> justified. If he has been robbed, the
                    robber will make haste <lb/> to secure the payment, and the Maurices may not
                        <reg orig="unreason-|ably">unreasonably</reg>
                    <lb/> conclude that the robber was Watson himself. Many <lb/> other particulars
                    were added by the stranger, to show the <lb/> extent of the evils flowing from
                    the death of his brother, and <lb/> the loss of the papers which he carried with
                    him.</p>
                <p>I was greatly at a loss, continued Wortley, what directions <lb/> or advice to
                    afford this man. Keysler, as you know, died <lb/> early of the pestilence; but
                    Keysler was the only resident <lb/> in this city with whom Williams had any
                    acquaintance. On <lb/> mentioning the propriety of preventing the sale of these
                    bills <lb/> in America, by some public notice, he told me that this <lb/>
                    caution had been early taken; and I now remembered <reg orig="see-|ing"
                        >seeing</reg>
                    <lb/> the advertisement, in which the bills had been <reg orig="represent-|ed"
                        >represented</reg>
                    <lb/> as having been lost or stolen in this city, and a reward <lb/> of a
                    thousand dollars was offered to any one who should <lb/> restore them. This
                    caution had been published in <reg orig="Septem-|ber">September</reg>, <lb/> in
                    all the trading towns from Portsmouth to Savannah, <lb/> but had produced no
                    satisfaction.</p>
                <p>I accompanied Williams to the mayor's office, in hopes <lb/> of finding in the
                    records of his proceedings, during the last <lb/> six months, some traces of
                    Watson, but neither these records <lb/> nor the memory of the magistrate,
                    afforded us any <reg orig="satisfac-|tion">satisfaction</reg>. <lb/> Watson's
                    friends had drawn up, likewise, a <reg orig="descrip-|tion">description</reg>
                    <lb/> of the person and dress of the fugitive, an account of <lb/> the incidents
                    attending his disappearance, and of the papers <lb/> which he had in his
                    possession, with the manner in which <lb/> these papers had been secured. These
                    had been already <lb/> published in the Southern newspapers, and have been just
                    <lb/> reprinted in our own. As the former notice had availed <lb/> nothing, this
                    second expedient was thought necessary to be <lb/> employed.</p>
                <p>After some reflection, it occurred to me that it might be <lb/> proper to renew
                    the attempt which Williams had made to <lb/> trace the footsteps of his freind
                    to the moment of his final <lb/> disappearance. He had pursued Watson to
                    Thetford's, but <lb/>
                    <pb n="26" entity="eaf033v2_0235" pid="uva-lib:349542"/> Thetford himself had
                    not been seen, and he had been <reg orig="con-|tented">contented</reg>
                    <lb/> with the vague information of his clerk. Thetford <lb/> and his family,
                    including his clerk, had perished, and it <lb/> seemed as if this source of
                    information was dried up. It was <lb/> possible, however, that old Thetford
                    might have some <reg orig="know-|ledge">knowledge</reg>
                    <lb/> of his nephew's transactions, by which some light might <lb/> chance to be
                    thrown upon this obscurity. I therefore called <lb/> on him, but found him
                    utterly unable to afford me the light <lb/> that I wished. My mention of the
                    packet which Watson had <lb/> brought to Thetford, containing documents
                    respecting the <lb/> capture of a certain ship, reminded him of the injuries
                    <lb/> which he had received from Welbeck, and excited him to <lb/> renew his
                    menaces and imputations on that wretch. Having <lb/> somewhat exhausted this
                    rhetoric, he proceeded to tell me <lb/> what connexion there was between the
                    remembrance of his <lb/> injuries and the capture of this vessel.</p>
                <p>This vessel and its cargo were, in fact, the property of <lb/> Welbeck. They had
                    been sent to a good market and had <lb/> been secured by an adequate insurance.
                    The value of this <lb/> ship and cargo, and the validity of the policy he had
                    taken <lb/> care to ascertain by means of his two nephews, one of whom <lb/> had
                    gone out supercargo. This had formed his inducement <lb/> to lend his three
                    notes to Welbeck, in exchange for three <lb/> other notes, the whole amount of
                    which included the <hi rend="italic"><reg orig="equita-|ble">equitable</reg>
                        <lb/> interest</hi> of <hi rend="italic">five per cent. per month</hi> on
                    his own loan. For <lb/> the payment of these notes, he by no means relied, as
                    the <lb/> world foolishly imagined, on the seeming opulence and <reg
                        orig="se-|cret">secret</reg>
                    <lb/> funds of Welbeck. These were illusions too gross to <lb/> have any
                    influence on him. He was too old a bird to be <lb/> decoyed into the net by <hi
                        rend="italic">such</hi> chaff. No; his nephew, the <lb/> supercargo, would
                    of course receive the produce of the <lb/> voyage, and so much of this produce
                    as would pay his debt. <lb/> He had procured the owner's authority to intercept
                    its <reg orig="pas-|sage">passage</reg>
                    <lb/> from the pocket of his nephew to that of Welbeck. In <lb/> case of loss,
                    he had obtained a similar security upon the <reg orig="pol-|icy">policy</reg>.
                    <lb/> Jamieson's proceedings had been the same with his <lb/> own, and no affair
                    in which he had ever engaged, had <reg orig="ap-|peared">appeared</reg>
                    <lb/> to be more free from hazard than this. Their <reg orig="calcu-|lations"
                        >calculations</reg>, <lb/> however, though plausible, were defeated. The
                    <lb/> ship was taken and condemned, for a cause which rendered <lb/> the
                    insurance ineffectual.</p>
                <pb n="27" entity="eaf033v2_0236" pid="uva-lib:349543"/>
                <p>I bestowed no time in reflecting on this tissue of <reg orig="extor-|tions"
                        >extortions</reg>
                    <lb/> and frauds, and on that course of events which so often <lb/> disconcerts
                    the stratagems of cunning. The names of <lb/> Welbeck and Watson were thus
                    associated together, and <lb/> filled my thoughts with restlessness and
                    suspicion. <reg orig="Wel-|beck">Welbeck</reg>
                    <lb/> was capable of any wickedness. It was possible an <lb/> interview had
                    happened between these men, and that the <reg orig="fu-|gitive">fugitive</reg>
                    <lb/> had been some way instrumental in Watson's fate. <lb/> These thoughts were
                    mentioned to Williams, whom the name <lb/> of Welbeck threw into the utmost
                    perturbation. On finding <lb/> that one of this name had dwelt in this city,
                    and, that he <lb/> had proved a villain, he instantly admitted the most dreary
                    <lb/> forebodings.</p>
                <p>I have heard, said Williams, the history of this Welbeck <lb/> a score of times
                    from my brother. There formerly <reg orig="sub-|sisted">subsisted</reg>
                    <lb/> a very intimate connexion between them. My <reg orig="bro-|ther"
                        >brother</reg>
                    <lb/> had conferred upon one whom he thought honest, <reg orig="innti-|merable"
                        >inntimerable</reg>
                    <lb/> benefits, but all his benefits had been repaid by <lb/> the blackest
                    treachery. Welbeck's character and guilt had <lb/> often been made the subject
                    of talk between us, but, on <lb/> these occasions, my brother's placid and
                    patient temper <reg orig="for-|sook">forsook</reg>
                    <lb/> him. His grief for the calamities which had sprung <lb/> from this man,
                    and his desire of revenge, burst all bounds, <lb/> and transported him to a
                    pitch of temporary frenzy. I <lb/> often inquired in what manner he intended to
                    act, if a <reg orig="meet-|ing">meeting</reg>
                    <lb/> should take place between them. He answered, that <lb/> doubtless he
                    should act like a maniac, in defiance of his <reg orig="so-|ber">sober</reg>
                    <lb/> principles, and of the duty which he owed his family.</p>
                <p>What, said I, would you stab or pistol him?</p>
                <p>No! I was not born for an assassin. I would upbraid <lb/> him in such terms as
                    the furious moment might suggest, and <lb/> then challenge him to a meeting,
                    from which either he or I <lb/> should not part with life. I would allow time
                    for him to <lb/> make his peace with Heaven, and for me to blast his <reg

                    <lb/> upon earth, and to make such provision for my <reg orig="possi-|ble"

                    <lb/> death, as duty and discretion would prescribe.</p>
                <p>Now, nothing is more probable than that Welbeck and <lb/> my brother have met.
                    Thetford would of course mention <lb/> his name and interest in the captured
                    ship, and hence the <lb/> residence of this detested being in this city, would
                    be made <lb/>
                    <pb n="28" entity="eaf033v2_0237" pid="uva-lib:349544"/> known. Their meeting
                    could not take place without some <lb/> dreadful consequence. I am fearful that
                    to that meeting <lb/> we must impute the disappearance of my brother.</p>

                    <lb/> had drawn; but bow should it be rendered certain? Walter <lb/> Thetford,
                    or some of his family, had possibly been witnesses <lb/> of something, which,
                    added to our previous knowledge, <lb/> might strengthen or prolong that clue,
                    one end of which <lb/> seemed now to be put into our hands; but Thetford's <reg

                    <lb/> was the only one of his family, who, by seasonable <lb/> flight from the

                    country, I repaired with all speed, <lb/> accompanied by Williams.</p>
                <p>The old man being reminded, by a variety of circumstances, <lb/> of the incidents
                    of that eventful period, was, at length, <lb/> enabled to relate that he had
                    been present at the meeting <lb/> which took place between Watson and his son
                    Walter, when <lb/> certain packets were delivered by the former, relative, as he
                    <lb/> quickly understood, to the condemnation of a ship in which <lb/> Thomas
                    Thetford had gone supercargo. He had noticed <lb/> some emotion of the stranger,
                    occasioned by his son's <reg orig="men-|tioning">mentioning</reg>
                    <lb/> the concern which Welbeck had in the vessel. He <lb/> likewise remembered
                    the stranger's declaring his intention <lb/> of visiting Welbeck, and requesting
                    Walter to afford him <lb/> directions to his house.</p>
                <p>"Next morning at the breakfast table, continued the old <lb/> man, I adverted to
                    yesterday's incidents, and asked my son <lb/> how Welbeck had borne the news of
                    the loss of his ship. <lb/> He bore it, said Walter, as a man of his wealth
                    ought to <lb/> bear so trivial a loss. But there was something very strange
                    <lb/> in his behaviour, says my son, when I mentioned the name <lb/> of the
                    captain who brought the papers; and when I <reg orig="men-|tioned"
                        >mentioned</reg>
                    <lb/> the captain's design of paying him a visit, he stared <lb/>
                    <pb n="29" entity="eaf033v2_0238" pid="uva-lib:349545"/> upon me, for a moment,
                    as if he were frighted out of his <lb/> wits, and then, snatching up his hat,
                    ran furiously out of the <lb/> house. This was all my son said upon that
                    occasion; but, <lb/> as I have since heard, it was on that very night, that <reg
                        orig="Wel-|beck">Welbeck</reg>
                    <lb/> absconded from his creditors."</p>
                <p>I have this moment returned from this interview with old <lb/> Thetford. I come
                    to you, because I thought it possible <lb/> that Mervyn, agreeably to your
                    expectations, had returned, <lb/> and I wanted to see the lad once more. My
                    suspicions with <lb/> regard to him have been confirmed, and a warrant was this
                    <lb/> day issued for apprehending him as Welbeck's accomplice.</p>
                <p>I was startled by this news. My friend, said I, be <reg orig="cau-|tions"
                        >cautions</reg>
                    <lb/> how you act, I beseech you. You know not in what <lb/> evils you may
                    involve the innocent. Mervyn I know to <lb/> be blameless; but Welbeck is
                    indeed, a villain. The <reg orig="lat-|ter">latter</reg>
                    <lb/> I shall not be sorry to see brought to justice, but the <lb/> former,
                    instead of meriting punishment, is entitled to <reg orig="re-|wards"
                        >rewards</reg>.</p>
                <p>So you believe, on the mere assertion of the boy, <reg orig="per-|haps"
                        >perhaps</reg>, <lb/> his plausible lies might produce the same effect upon
                    <lb/> me, but I must stay till he thinks proper to exert his skill. <lb/> The
                    suspicions to which he is exposed will not easily be <reg orig="ob-|viated"
                        >obviated</reg>; <lb/> but if he has any thing to say in his defence, his
                    <lb/> judicial examination will afford him the suitable opportunity. <lb/> Why
                    are you so much afraid to subject his innocence to <lb/> this test? It was not
                    till you heard his tale, that your own <lb/> suspicions were removed. Allow me
                    the same privilege of <lb/> unbelief.</p>
                <p>But you do me wrong, in deeming me the cause of his <lb/> apprehension. It is
                    Jamieson and Thetford's work, and <lb/> they have not proceeded on shadowy
                    surmises and the <reg orig="im-|pulses">impulses</reg>
                    <lb/> of mere revenge. Facts have come to light of which <lb/> you are wholly
                    unaware, and which, when known to you, <lb/> will conquer even your incredulity
                    as to the guilt of <lb/> Mervyn.</p>
                <p>Facts? Let me know them, I beseech you. If <reg orig="Mer-|vyn">Mervyn</reg>
                    <lb/> has deceived me, there is an end to my confidence <lb/> in human nature.
                    All limits to dissimulation, and all <reg orig="dis-|tinctness"
                        >distinctness</reg>
                    <lb/> between vice and virtue will be effaced. No <lb/> man's word, nor force of
                    collateral evidence shall weigh <lb/> with me a hair.</p>
                <pb n="30" entity="eaf033v2_0239" pid="uva-lib:349546"/>
                <p>It was time, replied my friend, that your confidence in <lb/> smooth features and
                    fluent accents should have ended long <lb/> ago. Till I gained from my present
                    profession, some <lb/> knowledge of the world, a knowledge which was not <reg
                        orig="gain-|ed">gained</reg>
                    <lb/> in a moment, and has not cost a trifle, I was equally wise <lb/> in my own
                    conceit; and, in order to decide upon the truth <lb/> of any one's pretensions,
                    needed only a clear view of his <lb/> face and a distinct hearing of his words.
                    My folly, in that <lb/> respect, was only to be cured, however, by my own <reg
                        orig="expe-|rience">experience</reg>, <lb/> and I suppose your credulity
                    will yield to no other <lb/> remedy. These are the facts:&mdash;</p>
                <p>Mrs. Wentworth, the proprietor of the house in which <lb/> Welbeck lived, has
                    furnished some intelligence respecting <lb/> Mervyn, whose truth cannot be
                    doubted, and which <reg orig="fur-|nishes">furnishes</reg>
                    <lb/> the strongest evidence of a conspiracy between this <lb/> lad and his
                    employer. It seems, that, some years since, a <lb/> nephew of this lady left his
                    father's family clandestinely, <lb/> and has not been heard of since. This
                    nephew was <reg orig="intend-|ed">intended</reg>
                    <lb/> to inherit her fortunes, and her anxieties and inquiries <lb/> respecting
                    him have been endless and incessant. These, <lb/> however, have been fruitless.
                    Welbeck, knowing these <lb/> circumstances, and being desirous of substituting a
                    girl whom <lb/> he had moulded for his purpose, in place of the lost youth,
                    <lb/> in the affections of the lady while living, and in her <reg
                        orig="testa-|ment">testament</reg>
                    <lb/> when dead, endeavored to persuade her that the youth <lb/> had died in
                    some foreign country. For this end, Mervyn <lb/> was to personate a kinsman of
                    Welbeck who had just arrived <lb/> from Europe, and who had been a witness of
                    her nephew's <lb/> death. A story was, no doubt, to be contrived, where <lb/>
                    truth should be copied with the most exquisite dexterity, <lb/> and the lady,
                    being prevailed upon to believe the story, <lb/> the way was cleared for
                    accomplishing the remainder of <lb/> the plot.</p>
                <p>In due time, and after the lady's mind had been artfully <lb/> prepared by
                    Welbeck, the pupil made his appearance; and, <lb/> in a conversation full of
                    studied ambiguities, assured the <lb/> lady, that her nephew was dead. For the
                    present he <reg orig="de-|clined">declined</reg>
                    <lb/> relating the particulars of his death, and displayed a <lb/> constancy and
                    intrepidity in resisting her entreaties, that <lb/> would have been admirable in
                    a better cause. Before she <lb/> had time to fathom this painful mystery,
                    Welbeck's frauds <lb/>
                    <pb n="31" entity="eaf033v2_0240" pid="uva-lib:349547"/> were in danger of
                    detection, and he and his pupil suddenly <lb/> disappeared.</p>
                <p>While the plot was going forward, there occurred an <reg orig="in-|cident"
                        >incident</reg>
                    <lb/> which the plotters had not foreseen or precluded, and <lb/> which possibly
                    might have created some confusion or <reg orig="im-|pediment">impediment</reg>
                    <lb/> in their designs. A bundle was found one night <lb/> in the street,
                    consisting of some coarse clothes, and <reg orig="con-|taining"
                    >containing</reg>, <lb/> in the midst of it, the miniature portrait of Mrs.
                    <lb/> Wentworth's nephew. It fell into the hands of one of that <lb/> lady's
                    friends, who immediately despatched the bundle to <lb/> her. Mervyn, in his
                    interview with this lady, spied the <lb/> portrait on the mantelpiece. Led by
                    some freak of fancy, <lb/> or some web of artifice, he introduced the talk
                    respecting <lb/> her nephew, by boldly claiming it as his; but, when the <lb/>
                    mode in which it had been found was mentioned, he was <lb/> disconcerted and
                    confounded, and precipitately withdrew.</p>
                <p>This conduct, and the subsequent flight of the lad, <reg orig="af-|forded"
                        >afforded</reg>
                    <lb/> ground enough to question the truth of his <reg orig="intelli-|gence"
                        >intelligence</reg>
                    <lb/> respecting her nephew; but it has since been <reg orig="con-|futed"
                        >confuted</reg>, <lb/> in a letter just received from her brother in
                    England. <lb/> In this letter she is informed, that her nephew had been <lb/>
                    seen by one who knew him well, in Charleston; that some <lb/> intercourse took
                    place between the youth and the bearer of <lb/> the news, in the course of which
                    the latter had persuaded <lb/> the nephew to return to his family, and that the
                    youth had <lb/> given some tokens of compliance. The letter-writer, who <lb/>
                    was father to the fugitive, had written to certain friends at <lb/> Charleston,
                    entreating them to use their influence with the <lb/> runaway to the same end,
                    and, at any rate, to cherish and <lb/> protect him. Thus, I hope you will admit
                    that the duplicity <lb/> of Mervyn is demonstrated.</p>
                <p>The facts which you have mentioned, said I, after some <lb/> pause, partly
                    correspond with Mervyn's story; but the last <lb/> particular is irreconcilably
                    repugnant to it. Now, for the <lb/> first time, I begin to feel that my
                    confidence is shaken. I <lb/> feel my mind bewildered and distracted by the
                    multitude <lb/> of new discoveries which have just taken place. I want <lb/>
                    time to revolve them slowly, to weigh them accurately, and <lb/> to estimate
                    their consequences fully. I am afraid to speak; <lb/> fearing, that, in the
                    present trouble of my thoughts, I may <lb/> say something which I may afterwards
                    regret. I want a <lb/>
                    <pb n="32" entity="eaf033v2_0241" pid="uva-lib:349548"/> counsellor; but you,
                    Wortley, are unfit for the office. <lb/> Your judgment is unfurnished with the
                    same materials; your <lb/> sufferings have soured your humanity and biassed your
                        <reg orig="can-|dor">candor</reg>. <lb/> The only one qualified to divide
                    with me these cares, <lb/> and aid in selecting the best mode of action, is my
                    wife. <lb/> She is mistress of Mervyn's history; an observer of his <lb/>
                    conduct during his abode with us; and is hindered, by her <lb/> education and
                    temper, from deviating into rigor and <reg orig="malevo-|lence"
                        >malevolence</reg>. <lb/> Will you pardon me, therefore, if I defer <reg
                        orig="com-|menting">commenting</reg>
                    <lb/> on your narrative till I have had an opportunity of <lb/> reviewing it and
                    comparing it with my knowledge of the lad, <lb/> collected from himself and from
                    my own observation.</p>
                <p>Wortley could not but admit the justice of my request, <lb/> and after some
                    desultory conversation we parted. I hastened <lb/> to communicate to my wife the
                    various intelligence which I <lb/> had lately received. Mrs. Althorpe's portrait
                    of the <reg orig="Mer-|vyns">Mervyns</reg>
                    <lb/> contained lineaments which the summary detail of <reg orig="Ar-|thur"
                        >Arthur</reg>
                    <lb/> did not enable us fully to comprehend. The treatment <lb/> which the youth
                    is said to have given to his father; the illicit <lb/> commerce that subsisted
                    between him and his father's wife; <lb/> the pillage of money and his father's
                    horse, but ill accorded <lb/> with the tale which we had heard, and disquieted
                    our minds <lb/> with doubts, though far from dictating our belief.</p>
                <p>What, however, more deeply absorbed our attention, was <lb/> the testimony of
                    Williams and of Mrs. Wentworth. That <lb/> which was mysterious and inscrutable
                    to Wortley and the <lb/> friends of Watson, was luminous to us. The coincidence
                    <lb/> between the vague hints, laboriously collected by these <reg
                        orig="in-|quirers">inquirers</reg>, <lb/> and the narrative of Mervyn,
                    afforded the most <lb/> cogent attestation of the truth of that narrative.</p>
                <p>Watson had vanished from all eyes, but the spot where <lb/> rested his remains
                    was known to us. The girdle spoken of <lb/> by Williams, would not be suspected
                    to exist by his <reg orig="mur-|derer">murderer</reg>. <lb/> It was unmolested,
                    and was doubtless buried with <lb/> him. That which was so earnestly sought, and
                    which <reg orig="con-|stituted">constituted</reg>
                    <lb/> the subsistence of the Maurices, would probably <lb/> be found adhering to
                    his body. What conduct was <reg orig="incum-|bent">incumbent</reg>
                    <lb/> upon me who possessed this knowledge?</p>
                <p>It was just to restore these bills to their true owner; but <lb/> how could this
                    be done without hazardous processes and <lb/> tedious disclosures? To whom ought
                    these disclosures to <lb/>

                    be dug up, and the lost treasure be taken <lb/> from amidst the horrible
                    corruption in which it was <reg orig="im-|mersed">immersed</reg>?</p>
                <p>This ought not to be the act of a single individual. This <lb/> act would
                    entangle him in a maze of perils and suspicions, <lb/> of concealments and
                    evasions, from which he could not hope <lb/> to escape with his reputation
                    inviolate. The proper method <lb/> was through the agency of the law. It is to
                    this that <lb/> Mervyn must submit his conduct. The story which he told <lb/> to
                    me he must tell to the world. Suspicions have fixed <lb/> themselves upon him,
                    which allow him not the privilege of <lb/> silence and obscurity. While he
                    continued unknown and <lb/> unthought of, the publication of his story would
                    only give <lb/> unnecessary birth to dangers; but now dangers are <reg

                    <lb/> which it may probably contribute to lessen, if not to <lb/> remove.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile the return of Mervyn to the city was anxiously <lb/> expected. Day
                    after day passed and no tidings were <reg orig="re-|ceived">received</reg>.
                    <lb/> I had business of an urgent nature which required <lb/> my presence in
                    Jersey, but which, in the daily expectation <lb/> of the return of my young
                    friend, I postponed a week <lb/> longer than rigid discretion allowed. At length
                    I was <lb/> obliged to comply with the exigence, and left the city, but <lb/>
                    made such arrangements that I should be apprized by my <lb/> wife of Mervyn's
                    return with all practicable expedition.</p>
                <p>These arrangements were superfluous, for my business <lb/> was despatched, and my
                    absence at an end, before the <lb/> youth had given us any tokens of his
                    approach. I now <reg orig="re-|membered">remembered</reg>
                    <lb/> the warnings of Wortley, and his assertions that <lb/> Mervyn had
                    withdrawn himself forever from cur view. The <lb/> event had hitherto
                    unwelcomely coincided with these <reg orig="pre-|dictions">predictions</reg>,
                    <lb/> and a thousand doubts and misgivings were <reg orig="awa-|kened"
                        >awakened</reg>.</p>
                <p>One evening, while preparing to shake off gloomy <lb/> thoughts by a visit to a
                    friend, some one knocked at my <lb/> door, and left a billet containing these
                    words:</p>
                <p>"<hi rend="italic">Dr. Stevens is requested to come immediately to the <lb/>
                        Debtors' Apartments in Prune Street.</hi>"</p>
                <p>This billet was without signature. The hand-writing was <lb/>
                    <pb n="34" entity="eaf033v2_0243" pid="uva-lib:349550"/> unknown, and the
                    precipitate departure of the bearer, left <lb/> me wholly at a loss with respect
                    to the person of the writer, <lb/> or the end for which my presence was
                    required. This <reg orig="un-|certainty">uncertainty</reg>
                    <lb/> only hastened my compliance with the summons.</p>
                <p>The evening was approaching&mdash;a time when the prison <lb/> doors are
                    accustomed to be shut and strangers to be <reg orig="ex-|cluded">excluded</reg>.
                    <lb/> This furnished an additional reason for despatch. <lb/> As I walked
                    swiftly along, I revolved the possible motives <lb/> that might have prompted
                    this message. A conjecture was <lb/> soon formed, which led to apprehension and
                    inquietude.</p>
                <p>One of my friends, by name Carlton, was embarrassed <lb/> with debts which he was
                    unable to discharge. He had lately <lb/> been menaced with arrest, by a creditor
                    not accustomed to <lb/> remit any of his claims. I dreaded that this catastrophe
                    <lb/> had now happened, and called to mind the anguish with <lb/> which this
                    untoward incident would overwhelmn his family. <lb/> I knew his incapacity to
                    take away the claim of his creditor <lb/> by payment, or to sooth him into
                    clemency by <reg orig="supplica-|tion">supplication</reg>.</p>
                <p>So prone is the human mind to create for itself distress, <lb/> that I was not
                    aware of the uncertainty of this evil till I <reg orig="ar-|rived">arrived</reg>
                    <lb/> at the prison. I checked myself at the moment when <lb/> I opened my lips
                    to utter the name of my friend, and was <lb/> admitted without particular
                    inquiries. I supposed that he by <lb/> whom I had been summoned hither would
                    meet me in the <lb/> common room.</p>
                <p>The apartment was filled with pale faces and withered <lb/> forms. The marks of
                    negligence and poverty were visible <lb/> in all; but few betrayed, in their
                    features or gestures, any <lb/> symptoms of concern on account of their
                    condition. <reg orig="Fe-|rocious">Ferocious</reg>
                    <lb/> gaiety, or stupid indifference, seemed to sit upon every <lb/> brow. The
                    vapor from a heated stove, mingled with the <lb/> fumes of beer and tallow that
                    were spilled upon it, and with <lb/> the tainted breath of so promiscuous a
                    crowd, loaded the <lb/> stagnant atmosphere. At my first transition from the
                    cold <lb/> and pure air without, to this noxious element, I found it <reg
                        orig="dif-|ficult">difficult</reg>
                    <lb/> to breathe. A moment, however, reconciled me to <lb/> my situation, and I
                    looked anxiously round to discover some <lb/> face which I knew.</p>
                <p>Almost every mouth was furnished with a cigar, and <lb/> every hand with a glass
                    of porter. Conversation, carried on <lb/>
                    <pb n="35" entity="eaf033v2_0244" pid="uva-lib:349551"/> with much emphasis of
                    tone and gesture, was not wanting. <lb/> Sundry groups, in different corners,
                    were beguiling the <lb/> tedious hours at whist. Others, unemployed, were
                    strolling <lb/> to and fro, and testified their vacancy of thought and care
                    <lb/> by humming or whistling a tune.</p>
                <p>I fostered the hope that my prognostics had deceived me. <lb/> This hope was
                    strengthened by reflecting that the billet <reg orig="re-|ceived">received</reg>
                    <lb/> was written in a different hand from that of my friend. <lb/> Meanwhile I
                    continued my search. Seated on a bench, <lb/> silent and aloof from the crowd,
                    his eyes fixed upon the <lb/> floor, and his face half concealed by his hand, a
                    form was <lb/> at length discovered which verified all my conjectures and <lb/>
                    fears. Carlton was he.</p>
                <p>My heart drooped, and my tongue faltered at this sight. <lb/> I surveyed him for
                    some minutes in silence. At length, <reg orig="ap-|proaching">approaching</reg>
                    <lb/> the bench on which he sat, I touched his hand <lb/> and awakened him from
                    his reverie. He looked up. A <lb/> momentary gleam of joy and surprise was
                    succeeded by a <lb/> gloom deeper than before.</p>
                <p>It was plain that my friend needed consolation. He was <lb/> governed by an
                    exquisite sensibility to disgrace. He was <lb/> impatient of constraint. He
                    shrunk, with fastidious <reg orig="abhor-|rence">abhorrence</reg>, <lb/> from
                    the contact of the vulgar and the profligate. <lb/> His constitution was
                    delicate and feeble. Impure airs, <reg orig="re-|straint">restraint</reg>
                    <lb/> from exercise, unusual aliment, unwholesome or <lb/> incommodious
                    accommodations, and perturbed thoughts, <lb/> were, at any time, sufficient to
                    generate disease and to <reg orig="de-|prive">deprive</reg>
                    <lb/> him of life.</p>
                <p>To these evils he was now subjected. He had no <reg orig="mo-|ney">money</reg>
                    <lb/> wherewith to purchase food. He had been dragged <lb/> hither in the
                    morning. He had not tasted a morsel since <lb/> his entrance. He had not
                    provided a bed on which to lie; <lb/> or inquired in what room, or with what
                    companions, the <lb/> night was to be spent.</p>
                <p>Fortitude was not among my friend's qualities. He was <lb/> more prone to shrink
                    from danger than encounter it, and to <lb/> yield to the flood rather than
                    sustain it; but it is just to <reg orig="ob-|serve">observe</reg>, <lb/> that
                    his anguish, on the present occasion, arose not <lb/> wholly from selfish
                    considerations. His parents were dead, <lb/> and two sisters were dependant on
                    him for support. One <lb/> of these was nearly of his own age. The other was
                    scarcely <lb/>
                    <pb n="36" entity="eaf033v2_0245" pid="uva-lib:349552"/> emerged from childhood.
                    There was an intellectual as <lb/> well as a personal resemblance between my
                    friend and his <lb/> sisters. They possessed his physical infirmities, his <reg
                        orig="vehe-|ment">vehement</reg>
                    <lb/> passions, and refinements of taste; and the misery of <lb/> his condition
                    was tenfold increased, by reflecting on the <lb/> feelings which would be
                    awakened in them by the knowledge <lb/> of his state, and the hardships to which
                    the loss of his succor <lb/> would expose them.</p>

                <p><hi rend="small-caps">It</hi> was not in my power to release my friend by the

                    <lb/> of his debt; but, by contracting with the keeper of the <lb/> prison for
                    his board, I could save him from famine; and, by <lb/> suitable exertions, could
                    procure him lodging as convenient <lb/> as the time would admit. I could promise
                    to console and <lb/> protect his sisters, and, by cheerful tones and frequent
                    visits, <lb/> dispel some part of the evil which encompassed him.</p>
                <p>After the first surprise had subsided, he inquired by what <lb/> accident this
                    meeting had been produced. Conscious of my <lb/> incapacity to do him any
                    essential service, and unwilling to <lb/> make me a partaker in his miseries, he
                    had forborne to <reg orig="in-|form">inform</reg>
                    <lb/> me of his condition.</p>
                <p>This assurance was listened to with some wonder. I <lb/> showed him the billet.
                    It had not been written by him. <lb/> He was a stranger to the penmanship. None
                    but the <reg orig="at-|torney">attorney</reg>
                    <lb/> and officer were apprized of his fate. It was obvious <lb/> to conclude,
                    that this was the interposition of some friend, <lb/> who, knowing my affection
                    for Carlton, had taken this <reg orig="mys-|terious">mysterious</reg>
                    <lb/> method of calling me to his succor.</p>
                <p>Conjectures, as to the author and motives of this <reg orig="interpo-|sition"
                        >interposition</reg>, <lb/> were suspended by more urgent considerations. I
                    <lb/> requested an interview with the keeper, and inquired how <lb/> Carlton
                    could be best accommodated.</p>
                <p>He said, that all his rooms were full but one, which, in <lb/> consequence of the
                    dismission of three persons in the <reg orig="morn-|ing">morning</reg>, <lb/>
                    had at present but one tenant. This person had lately <lb/> arrived, was sick,
                    and had with him, at this time, one of his <lb/> friends. Carlton might divide
                    the chamber with this person, <lb/>
                    <pb n="37" entity="eaf033v2_0246" pid="uva-lib:349553">

                    </pb> No doubt his consent would be readily given; though this <lb/>
                    arrangement, being the best, must take place whether he <lb/> consented or
                    not.</p>
                <p>This consent I resolved immediately to seek, and, for <lb/> that purpose, desired
                    to be led to the chamber. The door <lb/> of the apartment was shut. I knocked
                    for admission. It <lb/> was instantly opened, and I entered. The first person
                    who <lb/> met my view was&mdash;Arthur Mervyn.</p>
                <p>I started with astonishment. Mervyn's countenance <reg orig="be-|trayed"
                        >betrayed</reg>
                    <lb/> nothing but satisfaction at the interview. The traces <lb/> of fatigue and
                    anxiety gave place to tenderness and joy. It <lb/> readily occurred to me that
                    Mervyn was the writer of the <lb/> note which I had lately received. To meet him
                    within <lb/> these walls, and at this time, was the most remote and <reg
                        orig="unde-|sirable">undesirable</reg>
                    <lb/> of all contingencies. The same hour had thus made <lb/> me acquainted with
                    the kindred and unwelcome fate of two <lb/> beings whom I most loved.</p>
                <p>I had scarcely time to return his embrace, when, taking <lb/> my hand, he led me
                    to a bed that stood in one corner. <lb/> There was stretched upon it one whom a
                    second glance <lb/> enabled me to call by his name, though I had never before
                    <lb/> seen him. The vivid portrait which Mervyn had drawn was <lb/> conspicuous
                    in the sunken and haggard visage before me. <lb/> This face had, indeed,
                    proportions and lines which could <lb/> never be forgotten or mistaken. Welbeck,
                    when once seen or <lb/> described, was easily distinguished from the rest of
                    mankind. <lb/> He had stronger motives than other men for abstaining from <lb/>
                    guilt, the difficulty of concealment or disguise being tenfold <lb/> greater in
                    him than in others, by reason of the indelible and <lb/> eye-attracting marks
                    which nature had set upon him.</p>
                <p>He was pallid and emaciated. He did not open his eyes <lb/> on my entrance. He
                    seemed to be asleep; but, before I <lb/> had time to exchange glances with
                    Mervyn, or to inquire <lb/> into the nature of the scene, he awoke. On seeing me
                    he <lb/> started, and cast a look of upbraiding on my companion. <lb/> The
                    latter comprehended his emotion and endeavored to <lb/> appease him.</p>
                <p>This person said he is my friend. He is likewise a <reg orig="physi-|cian"
                        >physician</reg>; <lb/> and, perceiving your state to require medical <reg
                        orig="assist-|ance">assistance</reg>, <lb/> I ventured to send for him.</p>
                <pb n="38" entity="eaf033v2_0247" pid="uva-lib:349554"/>
                <p>Welbeck, replied, in a contemptuous and indignant tone, <lb/> thou mistakest my
                    condition, boy. My disease lies deeper <lb/> than his scrutiny will ever reach.
                    I had hoped thou wert <lb/> gone. Thy importunities are well meant, but they
                    aggravate <lb/> my miseries.</p>
                <p>He now rose from the bed, and continued, in a firm and <lb/> resolute tone, you
                    are intruders into this apartment. It is <lb/> mine, and I desire to be left
                    alone.</p>
                <p>Mervyn returned at first, no answer to this address. He <lb/> was immersed in
                    perplexity. At length, raising his eyes from <lb/> the floor, he said, my
                    intentions are indeed honest, and I am <lb/> grieved that I want the power of
                    persuasion. Tomorrow, <lb/> perhaps, I may reason more cogently with your
                    despair, or <lb/> your present mood may be changed. To aid my own <lb/> weakness
                    I will entreat the assistance of this friend.</p>
                <p>These words roused a new spirit in Welbeck. His <reg orig="con-|fusion"
                        >confusion</reg>
                    <lb/> and anger increased. His tongue faltered as he <reg orig="ex-|claimed"
                        >exclaimed</reg>, <lb/> good God! what mean you? Headlong and rash <lb/> as
                    you are, you will not share with this person your <reg orig="know-|ledge"
                        >knowledge</reg>
                    <lb/> of me? Here he checked himself, conscious that <lb/> the words he had
                    already uttered tended to the very end <lb/> which he dreaded. This
                    consciousness, added to the <reg orig="ter-|ror">terror</reg>
                    <lb/> of more ample disclosures, which the simplicity and <lb/> rectitude of
                    Mervyn might prompt him to make, chained <lb/> up his tongue, and covered him
                    with dismay.</p>
                <p>Mervyn was not long in answering.&mdash;I comprehend your <lb/> fears and your
                    wishes. I am bound to tell you the truth. <lb/> To this person your story has
                    already been told. Whatever <lb/> I have witnessed under your roof, whatever I
                    have heard <lb/> from your lips, have been faithfully disclosed to him.</p>
                <p>The countenance of Welbeck now betrayed a mixture of <lb/> incredulity and
                    horror. For a time his utterance was <reg orig="sti-|fled">stifled</reg>
                    <lb/> by his complicated feelings.</p>
                <p>It cannot be. So enormous a deed is beyond thy power. <lb/> Thy qualities are
                    marvellous. Every new act of thine <reg orig="out-|strips">outstrips</reg>
                    <lb/> the last, and belies the newest calculations. But this <lb/> &mdash;this
                    perfidy exceeds&mdash;this outrage upon promises, this <lb/> violation of faith,
                    this blindness to the future is incredible. <lb/> There he stopped; while his
                    looks seemed to call upon <lb/> Mervyn for a contradiction of his first
                    assertion.</p>
                <p>I know full well how inexpiably stupid or wicked my <lb/>
                    <pb n="39" entity="eaf033v2_0248" pid="uva-lib:349555"/> act will appear to you,
                    but I will not prevaricate or lie. I <lb/> repeat, that every thing is known to
                    him. Your birth; your <lb/> early fortunes; the incidents at Charleston and
                    Wilmington; <lb/> your treatment of the brother and sister; your interview <lb/>
                    with Watson, and the fatal issue of that interview&mdash;I have <lb/> told him
                    all, just as it was told to me.</p>
                <p>Here the shock that was felt by Welbeck overpowered <lb/> his caution and his
                    strength. He sunk upon the side of the <lb/> bed. His air was still incredulous,
                    and he continued to <lb/> gaze upon Mervyn. He spoke in a tone less
                    vehement.</p>
                <p>And hast thou then hetrayed me? Hast thou shut every <lb/> avenue to my return to
                    honor? Am I known to be a seducer <lb/> and assassin? To have meditated all
                    crimes, and to have <lb/> perpetrated the worst?</p>
                <p>Infamy and death are my portion. I know they are <reg orig="re-|served"
                        >reserved</reg>
                    <lb/> for me; but I did not think to receive them at thy <lb/> hands, that under
                    that innocent guise there lurked a heart <lb/> treacherous and cruel. But go;
                    leave me to myself. This <lb/> stroke has exterminated my remnant of hope. Leave
                    me <lb/> to prepare my neck for the halter, and my lips for this last, <lb/> and
                    bitterest cup.</p>
                <p>Mervyn struggled with his tears and replied, all this was <lb/> foreseen, and all
                    this I was prepared to endure. My friend <lb/> and I will withdraw, as you wish;
                    but tomorrow I return; <lb/> not to vindicate my faith or my humanity; not to
                    make you <lb/> recant your charges, or forgive the faults which I seem to <lb/>
                    have committed, but to extricate you from your present evil, <lb/> or to arm you
                    with fortitude.</p>
                <p>So saying he led the way out of the room. I followed <lb/> him in silence. The
                    strangeness and abruptness of this <lb/> scene left me no power to assume a part
                    in it. I looked on <lb/> with new and indescribable sensations. I reached the
                    <lb/> street before my recollection was perfectly recovered. I <lb/> then
                    reflected on the purpose that had led me to Welbeck's <lb/> chamber. This
                    purpose was yet unaccomplished. I <reg orig="de-|sired">desired</reg>
                    <lb/> Mervyn to linger a moment while I returned into the <lb/> house. I once
                    more inquired for the keeper, and told him <lb/> I should leave to him the
                    province of acquainting Welbeck <lb/> with the necessity of sharing his
                    apartment with a stranger. <lb/> I speedily rejoined Mervyn in the street.</p>
                <p>I lost no time in requiring an explanation of the scene <lb/>
                    <pb n="40" entity="eaf033v2_0249" pid="uva-lib:349556"/> that I had witnessed.
                    How became you once more the <lb/> companion of Welbeck? Why did you not inform
                    me by <lb/> letter of your arrival at Malverton, and of what occurred <lb/>
                    during your absence? What is the fate of Mr. Hadwin and <lb/> of Wallace?</p>
                <p>Alas! said he, I perceive, that, though I have written, <lb/> you have never
                    received my letters. The tale of what has <lb/> occurred since we parted is long
                    and various. I am not only <lb/> willing but eager to communicate the story, but
                    this is no <lb/> suitable place. Have patience till we reach your house. I <lb/>
                    have involved myself in perils and embarrassments from <lb/> which I depend upon
                    your counsel and aid to release me.</p>
                <p>I had scarcely reached my own door, when I was <reg orig="over-|taken"
                        >overtaken</reg>
                    <lb/> by a servant, whom I knew to belong to the family <lb/> in which Carlton
                    and his sisters resided. Her message, <lb/> therefore, was readily guessed. She
                    came, as I expected, <lb/> to inquire for my friend, who had left his home in
                    the <reg orig="morn-|ing">morning</reg>
                    <lb/> with a stranger, and had not yet returned. His <reg orig="ab-|sence"
                        >absence</reg>
                    <lb/> had occasioned some inquietude, and his sister had <lb/> sent this message
                    to me, to procure what information <reg orig="re-|specting">respecting</reg>
                    <lb/> the cause of his detention I was able to give.</p>
                <p>My perplexity hindered me, for some time, from <reg orig="answer-|ing"
                        >answering</reg>. <lb/> I was willing to communicate the painful truth with
                    <lb/> my own mouth. I saw the necessity of putting an end to <lb/> her suspense,
                    and of preventing the news from reaching <lb/> her with fallacious aggravations
                    or at an unseasonable time.</p>
                <p>I told the messenger, that I had just parted with Mr. <lb/> Carlton, that he was
                    well, and that I would speedily come <lb/> and acquaint his sister with the
                    cause of his absence.</p>
                <p>Though burning with curiosity respecting Mervyn and <lb/> Welbeck, I readily
                    postponed its gratification till my visit to <lb/> Miss Carlton was performed. I
                    had rarely seen this lady; my <lb/> friendship for her brother, though ardent,
                    having been lately <lb/> formed, and chiefly matured by interviews at my house.
                    I <lb/> had designed to introduce her to my wife, but various <reg
                        orig="acci-|dents">accidents</reg>
                    <lb/> had hindered the execution of my purpose. Now <lb/> consolation and
                    counsel was more needed than ever, and <lb/> delay or reluctance in bestowing it
                    would have been, in a <lb/> high degree, unpardonable.</p>
                <p>I therefore parted with Mervyn, requesting him to await <lb/> my return, and
                    promising to perform the engagement which <lb/>
                    <pb n="41" entity="eaf033v2_0250" pid="uva-lib:349557"/> compelled me to leave
                    him, with the utmost despatch. On <lb/> entering Miss Carlton's apartment, I
                    assumed an air of as <lb/> much tranquillity as possible. I found the lady
                    seated at <lb/> a desk, with pen in hand and parchment before her. She <lb/>
                    greeted me with affectionate dignity, and caught from my <lb/> countenance that
                    cheerfulness of which on my entrance she <lb/> was destitute.</p>
                <p>You come, said she, to inform me what has made my <lb/> brother a truant to day.
                    Till your message was received <lb/> I was somewhat anxious. This day he usually
                    spends in <lb/> rambling through the fields, but so bleak and stormy an <lb/>
                    atmosphere, I suppose, would prevent his excursion. I pray, <lb/> sir, what is
                    it detains him?</p>
                <p>To conquer my embarrassment, and introduce the <reg orig="sub-|ject"
                        >subject</reg>
                    <lb/> by indirect and cautious means, I eluded her question, <lb/> and casting
                    an eye at the parchment, How now? said I; <lb/> this is strange employment for a
                    lady. I knew that my <lb/> friend pursued this trade, and lived by binding fast
                    the <reg orig="bar-|gains">bargains</reg>
                    <lb/> which others made, but I knew not that the pen was <lb/> ever usurped by
                    his sister.</p>
                <p>The usurpation was prompted by necessity. My brother's <lb/> impatient temper and
                    delicate frame, unfitted him for this <lb/> trade. He pursued it with no less
                    reluctance than diligence, <lb/> devoting to the task three nights in the week,
                    and the whole <lb/> of each day. It would long ago have killed him, had I not
                    <lb/> bethought myself of sharing his tasks. The pen was <reg orig="irk-|some"
                        >irksome</reg>
                    <lb/> and toilsome at first, but use has made it easy, and <lb/> far more
                    eligible than the needle, which was formerly my <lb/> only tool.</p>
                <p>This arrangement affords my brother opportunities of <lb/> exercise and
                    recreation, without diminishing our profits; <lb/> and my time, though not less
                    constantly, is more agreeably, <lb/> as well as more lucratively employed than
                    formerly.</p>
                <p>I admire your reasoning. By this means provision is <lb/> made against untoward
                    accidents. If sickness should <reg orig="dis-|able">disable</reg>
                    <lb/> him, you are qualified to pursue the same means of <lb/> support.</p>
                <p>At these words the lady's countenance changed. She <lb/> put her hand on my arm,
                    and said, in a fluttering and hurried <lb/> accent, is my brother sick?</p>
                <pb n="42" entity="eaf033v2_0251" pid="uva-lib:349558"/>
                <p>No. He is in perfect health. My observation was a <lb/> harmless one. I am sorry
                    to observe your readiness to <lb/> draw alarming inferences. If I were to say,
                    that your <lb/> scheme is useful to supply deficiencies, not only when <lb/>
                    your brother is disabled by sickness, but when thrown, by <lb/> some inhuman
                    creditor, into jail, no doubt you would <reg orig="per-|versely"
                        >perversely</reg>
                    <lb/> and hastily infer that he is now in prison.</p>
                <p>I had scarcely ended the sentence, when the piercing <lb/> eyes of the lady were
                    anxiously fixed upon mine. After a <lb/> moment's pause, she
                    exclaimed:&mdash;The inference, indeed, is <lb/> too plain. I know his fate. It
                    has long been foreseen and <lb/> expected, and I have summoned up my equanimity
                    to meet <lb/> it. Would to Heaven he may find the calamity as light as <lb/> I
                    should find it; but I fear his too irritable spirit.</p>
                <p>When her fears were confirmed, she started out into no <lb/> vehemence of
                    exclamation. She quickly suppressed a few <lb/> tears which would not be
                    withheld, and listened to my <reg orig="nar-|rative">narrative</reg>
                    <lb/> of what had lately occurred, with tokens of gratitude.</p>
                <p>Formal consolation was superfluous. Her mind was <reg orig="in-|deed"
                        >indeed</reg>
                    <lb/> more fertile than my own in those topics which take <lb/> away its keenest
                    edge from affliction. She observed that it <lb/> was far from being the heaviest
                    calamity which might have <lb/> happened. The creditor was perhaps vincible by
                    arguments <lb/> and supplications. If these should succeed, the disaster <lb/>
                    would not only be removed, but that security from future <lb/> molestation be
                    gained, to which they had for a long time <lb/> been strangers.</p>
                <p>Should he be obdurate, their state was far from being <lb/> hopeless. Carlton's
                    situation allowed him to pursue his <reg orig="pro-|fession">profession</reg>.
                    <lb/> His gains would be equal, and his expenses would <lb/> not be augmented.
                    By their mutual industry they might <lb/> hope to amass sufficient to discharge
                    the debt at no very <lb/> remote period.</p>
                <p>What she chiefly dreaded was the pernicious influence of <lb/> dejection and
                    sedentary labor on her brother's health. Yet <lb/> this was not to be considered
                    as inevitable. Fortitude <lb/> might be inspired by exhortation and example, and
                    no <reg orig="con-|dition">condition</reg>
                    <lb/> precluded us from every species of bodily exertion. <lb/> The less
                    inclined he should prove to cultivate the means <lb/> of deliverance and
                    happiness within his reach, the more <lb/>
                    <pb n="43" entity="eaf033v2_0252" pid="uva-lib:349559"/> necessary it became for
                    her to stimulate and fortify his <lb/> resolution.</p>
                <p>If I were captivated by the charms of this lady's person <lb/> and carriage, my
                    reverence was excited by these proofs of <lb/> wisdom and energy. I zealously
                    promised to concur with <lb/> her in every scheme she should adopt for her own
                    or her <lb/> brother's advantage; and after spending some hours with <lb/> her,
                    took my leave.</p>
                <p>I now regretted the ignorance in which I had hitherto <lb/> remained respecting
                    this lady. That she was, in an eminent <lb/> degree, feminine and lovely, was
                    easily discovered; but <lb/> intellectual weakness had been rashly inferred from
                    external <lb/> frailty. She was accustomed to shrink from observation, <lb/> and
                    reserve was mistaken for timidity. I called on Carlton <lb/> only when numerous
                    engagements would allow, and when <lb/> by some accident, his customary visits
                    had been intermitted. <lb/> On those occasions, my stay was short, and my
                    attention <lb/> chiefly confined to her brother. I now resolved to atone for
                    <lb/> my ancient negligence, not only by my own assiduities, but <lb/> by those
                    of my wife.</p>
                <p>On my return home, I found Mervyn and my wife in <lb/> earnest discourse. I
                    anticipated the shock which the <reg orig="sen-|sibility">sensibility</reg>
                    <lb/> of the latter would receive from the tidings which I <lb/> had to
                    communicate respecting Carlton. I was unwilling, <lb/> and yet perceived the
                    necessity of disclosing the truth. I <lb/> desired to bring these women, as soon
                    as possible, to the <lb/> knowledge of each other, but the necessary prelude to
                    this <lb/> was an acquaintance with the disaster that had happened.</p>
                <p>Scarcely had I entered the room, when Mervyn turned <lb/> to me, and said, with
                    an air of anxiety and impatience&mdash; <lb/> Pray, my friend, have you any
                    knowledge of Francis <lb/> Carlton?</p>
                <p>The mention of this name by Mervyn, produced some <lb/> surprise. I acknowledged
                    my acquaintance with him.</p>
                <p>Do you know in what situation he now is?</p>
                <p>In answer to this question, I stated by what singular <lb/> means his situation
                    had been made known to me, and the <lb/> purpose, from the accomplishment of
                    which, I had just <lb/> returned. I inquired, in my turn, whence originated this
                    <lb/> question?</p>
                <pb n="44" entity="eaf033v2_0253" pid="uva-lib:349560"/>
                <p>He had overheard the name of Carlton in the prison. <lb/> Two persons were
                    communing in a corner, and accident <lb/> enabled him to catch this name, though
                    uttered by them in <lb/> a half whisper, and to discover that the person talked
                    about <lb/> had lately been conveyed thither.</p>
                <p>This name was not now heard for the first time. It was <lb/> connected with
                    remembrances that made him anxious for <lb/> the fate of him to whom it
                    belonged. In discourse with <lb/> my wife, this name chanced to be again
                    mentioned, and his <lb/> curiosity was roused afresh. I was willing to
                    communicate <lb/> all that I knew, but Mervyn's own destiny was too <reg
                        orig="remark-|able">remarkable</reg>
                    <lb/> not to absorb all my attention, and I refused to discuss <lb/> any other
                    theme till that were fully explained. He <reg orig="post-|poned">postponed</reg>
                    <lb/> his own gratification to mine, and consented to relate <lb/> the incidents
                    that had happened from the moment of our <lb/> separation till the present.</p>

                <p><hi rend="small-caps">At</hi> parting with you, my purpose was to reach the abode
                    <lb/> of the Hadwins as speedily as possible. I travelled therefere <lb/> with
                    diligence. Setting out so early, I expected, though on <lb/> foot, to reach the
                    end of my journey before noon. The <lb/> activity of muscles is no obstacle to
                    thought. So far from <lb/> being inconsistent with intense musing, it is, in my
                    own <lb/> case, propitious to that state of mind.</p>
                <p>Probably no one had stronger motives for ardent <reg orig="medita-|tion"
                        >meditation</reg>
                    <lb/> than I. My second journey to the city was prompted <lb/> by reasons, and
                    attended by incidents, that seemed to have <lb/> a present existence. To think
                    upon them, was to view, more <lb/> deliberately and thoroughly, objects and
                    persons that still <lb/> hovered in my sight. Instead of their attributes being
                    <lb/> already seen, and their consequences at an end, it seemed <lb/> as if a
                    series of numerous years and unintermitted <reg orig="contem-|plation"
                        >contemplation</reg>
                    <lb/> were requisite to comprehend them fully, and bring <lb/> into existence
                    their most momentous effects.</p>
                <p>If men be chiefly distinguished from each other by the <lb/> modes in which
                    attention is employed, either on external <lb/>
                    <pb n="45" entity="eaf033v2_0254" pid="uva-lib:349561">

                    </pb> and sensible objects, or merely on abstract ideas and the <lb/> creatures
                    of reflection, I may justly claim to be enrolled <lb/> in the second class. My
                    existence is a series of thoughts <lb/> rather than of motions. Ratiocination
                    and deduction leave <lb/> my senses unemployed. The fulness of my fancy renders
                    <lb/> my eye vacant and inactive. Sensations do not precede <lb/> and suggest,
                    but follow and are secondary to the acts of <lb/> my mind.</p>
                <p>There was one motive, however, which made me less <reg orig="in-|attentive"
                        >inattentive</reg>
                    <lb/> to the scene that was continually shifting before <lb/> and without me
                    than I am wont to be. The loveliest form <lb/> which I had hitherto seen, was
                    that of Clemenza Lodi. I <lb/> recalled her condition as I had witnessed it, as
                    Welbeck <lb/> had described, and as you had painted it. The past was <lb/>
                    without remedy; but the future was, in some degree, <reg orig="with-|in"
                        >within</reg>
                    <lb/> our power to create and to fashion. Her state was <reg orig="pro-|bably"
                        >probably</reg>
                    <lb/> dangerous. She might already be forlorn, beset with <lb/> temptation or
                    with anguish; or danger might only be <reg orig="ap-|proaching"
                        >approaching</reg>
                    <lb/> her, and the worst evils be impending ones.</p>
                <p>I was ignorant of her state. Could I not remove this <lb/> ignorance? Would not
                    some benefit redound to her from <lb/> beneficent and seasonable
                    interposition?</p>
                <p>You had mentioned that her abode had lately been with <lb/> Mrs. Villars, and
                    that this lady still resided in the country. <lb/> The residence had been
                    sufficiently described, and I <reg orig="per-|ceived">perceived</reg>
                    <lb/> that I was now approaching it. In a short time I <lb/> spied its painted
                    roof and five chimnies through an avenue <lb/> of <hi rend="italic"
                        >catalpas.</hi></p>
                <p>When opposite the gate which led into this avenue, I <lb/> paused. It seemed as
                    if this moment were to decide upon <lb/> the liberty and innocence of this
                    being. In a moment I <lb/> might place myself before her, ascertain her true
                    condition, <lb/> and point out to her the path of honor and safety. This <lb/>
                    opportunity might be the last. Longer delay might render <lb/> interposition
                    fruitless.</p>
                <p>But how was I to interpose? I was a stranger to her <reg orig="lan-|guage"
                        >language</reg>, <lb/> and she was unacquainted with mine. To obtain <lb/>
                    access to her, it was necessary only to demand it. But <lb/> how should I
                    explain my views and state my wishes when <lb/>
                    <pb n="46" entity="eaf033v2_0255" pid="uva-lib:349562"/> an interview was
                    gained? And what expedient was it in <lb/> my power to propose?</p>
                <p>Now, said I, I perceive the value of that wealth which I <lb/> have been
                    accustomed to despise. The power of eating <lb/> and drinking, the nature and
                    limits of existence and <reg orig="phy-|sical">physical</reg>
                    <lb/> enjoyment, are not changed or enlarged by the <reg orig="in-|crease"
                        >increase</reg>
                    <lb/> of wealth. Our corporeal and intellectual wants are <lb/> supplied at
                    little expense; but our own wants are the wants <lb/> of others, and that which
                    remains, after our own <reg orig="necessi-|ties">necessities</reg>
                    <lb/> are obviated, it is always easy and just to employ in <lb/> relieving the
                    necessities of others.</p>
                <p>There are no superfluities in my store. It is not in my <lb/> power to supply
                    this unfortunate girl with decent raiment <lb/> and honest bread. I have no
                    house to which to conduct <lb/> her. I have no means of securing her from famine
                    and <lb/> cold.</p>
                <p>Yet, though indigent and feeble, I am not destitute of <lb/> friends and of home.
                    Cannot she be admitted to the same <lb/> asylum to which I am now going? This
                    thought was sudden <lb/> and new. The more it was revolved, the more plausible
                    <lb/> it seemed. This was not merely the sole expedient, but <lb/> the best that
                    could have been suggested.</p>
                <p>The Hadwins were friendly, hospitable, unsuspicious. <lb/> Their board, though
                    simple and uncouth, was wholesome <lb/> and plenteous. Their residence was
                    sequestered and <reg orig="ob-|scure">obscure</reg>, <lb/> and not obnoxious to
                    impertinent inquiries and <reg orig="ma-|lignant">malignant</reg>
                    <lb/> animadversion. Their frank and ingenuous temper <lb/> would make them easy
                    of persuasion, and their sympathies <lb/> were prompt and overflowing.</p>
                <p>I am nearly certain, continued I, that they will instantly <lb/> afford
                    protection to this desolate girl. Why shall I not <reg orig="an-|ticipate"
                        >anticipate</reg>
                    <lb/> their consent, and present myself to their embraces <lb/> and their
                    welcomes in her company?</p>
                <p>Slight reflection shewed me, that this precipitation was <lb/> improper. Whether
                    Wallace had ever arrived at <reg orig="Malver-|ton">Malverton</reg>? <lb/>
                    Whether Mr. Hadwin had escaped infection? <reg orig="whe-|ther">whether</reg>
                    <lb/> his house were the abode of security and quiet, or a <lb/> scene of
                    desolation? Were questions yet to be <reg orig="determin-|ed">determined</reg>.
                    <lb/> The obvious and best proceeding was to hasten <reg orig="for-|ward"
                        >forward</reg>, <lb/> to afford the Hadwins, if in distress, the feeble <reg
                        orig="con-|solations">consolations</reg>
                    <lb/> of my friendship; or, if their state were happy, <lb/>
                    <pb n="47" entity="eaf033v2_0256" pid="uva-lib:349563"/> to procure their
                    concurrence to my scheme respecting <lb/> Clemenza.</p>
                <p>Actuated by these considerations, I resumed my journey. <lb/> Looking forward, I
                    perceived a chaise and horse standing <lb/> by the left hand fence, at the
                    distance of some hundred <lb/> yards. This object was not uncommon or strange,
                    and, <lb/> therefore, it was scarcely noticed. When I came near, <reg
                        orig="how-|ever">however</reg>, <lb/> methought I recognised in this
                    carriage the same in <lb/> which my importunities had procured a seat for the
                        <reg orig="languish-|ing">languishing</reg>
                    <lb/> Wallace, in the manner which I have formerly related.</p>
                <p>It was a crazy vehicle and old fashioned. When once <lb/> seen it could scarcely
                    be mistaken or forgotten. The horse <lb/> was held by his bridle to a post, but
                    the seat was empty. <lb/> My solicitude with regard to Wallace's destiny, of
                    which he <lb/> to whom the carriage belonged might possibly afford me <lb/> some
                    knowledge, made me stop and reflect on what <reg orig="mea-|sures"
                        >measures</reg>
                    <lb/> it was proper to pursue.</p>
                <p>The rider could not be at a great distance from this spot. <lb/> His absence
                    would probably be short. By lingering a few <lb/> minutes an interview might be
                    gained, and the uncertainty <lb/> and suspense of some hours be thereby
                    precluded. I <reg orig="there-|fore">therefore</reg>
                    <lb/> waited, and the same person whom I had formerly <reg orig="en-|countered"
                        >encountered</reg>
                    <lb/> made his appearance, in a short time, from under <lb/> a copse that
                    skirted the road.</p>
                <p>He recognised me with more difficulty than attended my <lb/> recognition of him.
                    The circumstances, however, of our <lb/> first meeting were easily recalled to
                    his remembrance. I <lb/> eagerly inquired when and where he had parted with the
                    <lb/> youth who had been, on that occasion, entrusted to his care.</p>
                <p>He answered, that, on leaving the city and inhaling the <lb/> purer air of the
                    fields and woods, Wallace had been, in a <lb/> wonderful degree, invigorated and
                    refreshed. An <reg orig="instanta-|neous">instantaneous</reg>
                    <lb/> and total change appeared to have been wrought in <lb/> him. He no longer
                    languished with fatigue or fear, but <lb/> became full of gaiety and talk.</p>
                <p>The suddenness of this transition; the levity with which <lb/> he related and
                    commented on his recent dangers and evils, <lb/> excited the astonishment of his
                    companion, to whom he not <lb/> only communicated the history of his disease,
                    but imparted <lb/> many anecdotes of a humorous kind. Some of these my <lb/>
                    companion repeated. I heard them with regret and <reg orig="dissatis-|faction"
                        >dissatisfaction</reg>. <lb/>
                    <pb n="48" entity="eaf033v2_0257" pid="uva-lib:349564"/> They betokened a mind
                    vitiated by intercourse <lb/> with the thoughtless and depraved of both sexes,
                    and <reg orig="par-|ticularly">particularly</reg>
                    <lb/> with infamous and profligate women.</p>
                <p>My companion proceeded to mention, that Wallace's <lb/> exhiliration lasted but
                    for a short time, and disappeared as <lb/> suddenly as it had appeared. He was
                    seized with deadly <lb/> sickness, and insisted upon leaving the carriage, whose
                    <lb/> movements shocked his stomach and head to an <reg orig="insupporta-|ble"
                        >insupportable</reg>
                    <lb/> degree. His companion was not void of apprehensions <lb/> on his own
                    account, but was unwilling to desert him, and <lb/> endeavored to encourage him.
                    His efforts were vain. <lb/> Though the nearest house was at the distance of
                    some <lb/> hundred yards, and though it was probable that the <reg
                        orig="inhabit-|ants">inhabitants</reg>
                    <lb/> of this house would refuse to accommodate one in his <lb/> condition, yet
                    Wallace could not be prevailed on to proceed; <lb/> and, in spite of persuasion
                    and remonstrance, left the <reg orig="car-|riage">carriage</reg>
                    <lb/> and threw himself on the grassy bank beside the road.</p>
                <p>This person was not unmindful of the hazard which he <lb/> incurred by contact
                    with a sick man. He conceived <reg orig="him-|self">himself</reg>
                    <lb/> to have performed all that was consistent with duty to <lb/> himself and
                    to his family; and Wallace, persisting in <reg orig="affirm-|ing"
                        >affirming</reg>
                    <lb/> that, by attempting to ride farther, he should merely <lb/> hasten his
                    death, was at length left to his own guidance.</p>
                <p>These were unexpected and mournful tidings. I had <lb/> fondly imagined, that his
                    safety was put beyond the reach of <lb/> untoward accidents. Now, however, there
                    was reason to <lb/> suppose him to have perished by a lingering and painful
                    <lb/> disease, rendered fatal by the selfishness of mankind, by the <lb/> want
                    of seasonable remedies, and exposure to inclement <lb/> airs. Some uncertainty,
                    however, rested on his fate. It <lb/> was my duty to remove it, and to carry to
                    the Hadwins no <lb/> mangled and defective tale. Where, I asked, had Wallace
                    <lb/> and his companion parted?</p>
                <p>It was about three miles further onward. The spot and <lb/> the house within view
                    from the spot, were accurately <reg orig="de-|scribed">described</reg>. <lb/> In
                    this house it was possible that Wallace had <lb/> sought an asylum, and some
                    intelligence respecting him <lb/> might be gained from its inhabitants. My
                    informant was <lb/> journeying to the city, so that we were obliged to
                    separate.</p>
                <p>In consequence of this man's description of Wallace's <lb/> deportment, and the
                    proofs of a dissolute and thoughtless <lb/>

                    </pb> temper which he had given, I began to regard his death as <lb/> an event
                    less deplorable. Such a one was unworthy of a <lb/> being so devoutly pure, so
                    ardent in fidelity and tenderness <lb/> as Susan Hadwin. If he loved, it was
                    probable that in <reg orig="de-|fiance">defiance</reg>
                    <lb/> of his vows, he would seek a different companion. <lb/> If he adhered to
                    his first engagements, his motives would be <lb/> sordid, and the disclosure of
                    his latent defects might produce <lb/> more exquisite misery to his wife, than
                    his premature death <lb/> or treacherous desertion.</p>
                <p>The preservation of this man, was my sole motive for <lb/> entering the infected
                    city, and subjecting my own life to the <lb/> hazards, from which my escape may
                    almost be esteemed <lb/> miraculous. Was not the end disproportioned to the
                    means? <lb/> Was there arrogance in believing my life a price too great <lb/> to
                    be given for his?</p>
                <p>I was not, indeed, sorry for the past. My purpose was <lb/> just, and the means
                    which I selected, were the best my <lb/> limited knowledge supplied. My
                    happiness should be drawn <lb/> from reflecting on the equity of my intentions.
                    That these <lb/> intentions were frustrated by the ignorance of others, or my
                    <lb/> own, was the consequence of human frailty. Honest <reg orig="pur-|poses"
                        >purposes</reg>, <lb/> though they may not bestow happiness on others, <lb/>
                    will, at least, secure it to him who fosters them.</p>
                <p>By these reflections my regrets were dissipated, and I <lb/> prepared to rejoice
                    alike, whether Wallace should be found <lb/> to have escaped or to have
                    perished. The house to which <lb/> I had been directed was speedily brought into
                    view. I <lb/> inquired for the master or mistress of the mansion, and was <lb/>
                    conducted to a lady of a plain and housewifely appearance.</p>
                <p>My curiosity was fully gratified. Wallace, whom my <lb/> description easily
                    identified, had made his appearance at <lb/> her door on the evening of the day
                    on which he left the <lb/> city. The dread of <hi rend="italic">the fever</hi>
                    was descanted on with copious <lb/> and rude eloquence. I supposed her eloquence
                    on this <lb/> theme to be designed to apologize to me for her refusing <lb/>
                    entrance to the sick man. The peroration, however, was <lb/> different. Wallace
                    was admitted, and suitable attention <lb/> paid to his wants.</p>
                <p>Happily, the guest had nothing to struggle with but <reg orig="ex-|treme"
                        >extreme</reg>
                    <lb/> weakness. Repose, nourishing diet, and salubrious <lb/>
                    <pb n="50" entity="eaf033v2_0259" pid="uva-lib:349566"/> airs restored him in a
                    short time to health. He lingered <lb/> under this roof for three weeks, and
                    then, without any <reg orig="pro-|fessions">professions</reg>
                    <lb/> of gratitude, or offers of pecuniary remuneration, or <lb/> information of
                    the course which he determined to take, he <lb/> left them.</p>
                <p>These facts, added to that which I had previously known, <lb/> threw no
                    advantageous light upon the character of Wallace. <lb/> It was obvious to
                    conclude, that he had gone to Malverton, <lb/> and thither there was nothing to
                    hinder me from following <lb/> him.</p>
                <p>Perhaps, one of my grossest defects is a precipitate <reg orig="tem-|per"
                        >temper</reg>. <lb/> I choose my path suddenly, and pursue it with <reg
                        orig="im-|petuous">impetuous</reg>
                    <lb/> expedition. In the present instance, my resolution <lb/> was conceived
                    with unhesitating zeal, and I walked the faster <lb/> that I might the sooner
                    execute it. Miss Hadwin deserved <lb/> to be happy. Love was in her heart the
                    all-absorbing <reg orig="senti-|ment">sentiment</reg>. <lb/> A disappointment
                    there was a supreme calamity. <lb/> Depravity and folly must assume the guise of
                    virtue before <lb/> it can claim her affection. This disguise might be <reg
                        orig="maintain-|ed">maintained</reg>
                    <lb/> for a time, but its detection must inevitably come, and the <lb/> sooner
                    this detection takes place the more beneficial it must <lb/> prove.</p>
                <p>I resolved to unbosom myself, with equal and unbounded <lb/> confidence, to
                    Wallace and his mistress. I would choose <lb/> for this end, not the moment when
                    they were separate, but <lb/> that in which they were together. My knowledge,
                    and the <lb/> sources of my knowledge, relative to Wallace, should be <reg
                        orig="un-|folded">unfolded</reg>
                    <lb/> to the lady with simplicity and truth. The lover <lb/> should be present,
                    to confute, to extenuate, or to verify the <lb/> charges.</p>
                <p>During the rest of the day these images occupied the <lb/> chief place in my
                    thoughts. The road was miry and dark, <lb/> and my journey proved to be more
                    tedious and fatiguing <lb/> than I expected. At length, just as the evening
                    closed, the <lb/> well known habitation appeared in view. Since my <reg
                        orig="depar-|ture">departure</reg>, <lb/> winter had visited the world, and
                    the aspect of nature <lb/> was desolate and dreary. All around this house was
                    vacant, <lb/> negligent, forlorn. The contrast between these <reg
                        orig="appear-|ances">appearances</reg>
                    <lb/> and those which I had noticed on my first approach to <lb/> it, when the
                    ground and the trees were decked with the <lb/> luxuriance and vivacity of
                    summer, was mournful, and <lb/>
                    <pb n="51" entity="eaf033v2_0260" pid="uva-lib:349567"/> seemed to foretoken
                    ill. My spirits drooped as I noticed <lb/> the general inactivity and
                    silence.</p>
                <p>I entered, without warning, the door that led into the <reg orig="par-|lor"
                        >parlor</reg>. <lb/> No face was to be seen or voice heard. The chimney
                    <lb/> was ornamented, as in summer, with evergreen shrubs. <lb/> Though it was
                    now the second month of frost and snow, fire <lb/> did not appear to have been
                    lately kindled on this hearth.</p>
                <p>This was a circumstance from which nothing good could <lb/> be deduced. Had there
                    been those to share its comforts, <lb/> who had shared them on former years,
                    this was the place <lb/> and hour at which they commonly assembled. A door on
                    <lb/> one side led, through a narrow entry, into the kitchen. I <lb/> opened
                    this door, and passed towards the kitchen.</p>
                <p>No one was there but an old man, squatted in the <reg orig="chim-|ney"
                        >chimney</reg>
                    <lb/> corner. His face, though wrinkled, denoted undecayed <lb/> health and an
                    unbending spirit. A homespun coat, leathern <lb/> breeches wrinkled with age,
                    and blue yarn hose, were well <lb/> suited to his lean and shrivelled form. On
                    his right knee <lb/> was a wooden bowl, which he had just replenished from a
                    <lb/> pipkin of hasty pudding still smoking on the coals; and in <lb/> his left
                    hand a spoon, which he had, at that moment, <reg orig="plun-|ged">plunged</reg>
                    <lb/> into a bottle of molasses that stood beside him.</p>
                <p>This action was suspended by my entrance. He looked <lb/> up and exclaimed, hey
                    day! who's this that comes into <lb/> other people's houses without so much as
                    saying "by your <lb/> leave?" What's thee business? Who's thee want?</p>
                <p>I had never seen this personage before. I supposed it to <lb/> be some new
                    domestic, and inquired for Mr. Hadwin.</p>
                <p>Ah! replied he with a sigh, William Hadwin. Is it him <lb/> thee wants? Poor man!
                    He is gone to rest many days <lb/> since.</p>
                <p>My heart sunk within me at these tidings. Dead, said I, <lb/> do you mean that he
                    is dead?&mdash;This exclamation was uttered <lb/> in a tone of some veliemence.
                    It attracted the attention of <lb/> some one who was standing without, who
                    immediately <reg orig="en-|tered">entered</reg>
                    <lb/> the kitchen. It was Eliza Hadwin. The moment <lb/> she beheld me she
                    shrieked aloud, and, rushing into my <lb/> arms, fainted away.</p>
                <p>The old man dropped his bowl; and, starting from his <lb/> seat, stared
                    alternately at me and at the breathless girl. My <lb/> emotion, made up of joy,
                    and sorrow, and surprise, rendered <lb/>
                    <pb n="52" entity="eaf033v2_0261" pid="uva-lib:349568"/> me for a moment
                    powerless as she. At length, he said, I <lb/> understand this. I know who thee
                    is, and will tell her thee's <lb/> come. So saying he hastily left the room.</p>

                <p><hi rend="small-caps">In</hi> a short time this gentle girl recovered her senses.
                    She <lb/> did not withdraw herself from my sustaining arm, but, <reg
                        orig="lean-|ing">leaning</reg>
                    <lb/> on my bosom, she resigned herself to passionate weeping. <lb/> I did not
                    endeavor to check this effusion, believing that its <lb/> influence would be
                    salutary.</p>
                <p>I had not forgotten the thrilling sensibility and artless <lb/> graces of this
                    girl. I had not forgotten the scruples which <lb/> had formerly made me check a
                    passion whose tendency was <lb/> easily discovered. These new proofs of her
                    affection were, <lb/> at once, mournful and delightful. The untimely fate of her
                    <lb/> father and my friend pressed with new force upon my heart, <lb/> and my
                    tears, in spite of my fortitude, mingled with hers.</p>
                <p>The attention of both was presently attracted by a faint <lb/> scream, which
                    proceeded from above. Immediately <reg orig="totter-|ing">tottering</reg>
                    <lb/> footsteps were heard in the passage, and a figure rushed <lb/> into the
                    room, pale, emaciated, haggard, and wild. She <lb/> cast a piercing glance at
                    me, uttered a feeble exclamation, <lb/> and sunk upon the floor without signs of
                    life.</p>
                <p>It was not difficult to comprehend this scene. I now <lb/> conjectured, what
                    subsequent inquiry confirmed, that the <lb/> old man had mistaken me for
                    Wallace, and had carried to <lb/> the elder sister the news of his return. This
                    fatal <reg orig="disap-|pointment">disappointment</reg>
                    <lb/> of hopes that had nearly been extinct, and which <lb/> were now so
                    powerfully revived, could not be endured by a <lb/> frame verging to
                    dissolution.</p>
                <p>This object recalled all the energies of Eliza, and <reg orig="en-|grossed"
                        >engrossed</reg>
                    <lb/> all my solicitude. I lifted the fallen girl in my arms; <lb/> and, guided
                    by her sister, carried her to her chamber. I <lb/> had now leisure to
                    contemplate the changes which a few <lb/> months had made in this lovely frame.
                    I turned away from <lb/> the spectacle with anguish, but my wandering eyes were
                    <lb/> recalled by some potent fascination, and fixed in horror <reg
                        orig="up-|on">upon</reg>
                    <lb/>
                    <pb n="53" entity="eaf033v2_0262" pid="uva-lib:349569"/> a form which evinced
                    the last stage of decay. Eliza <lb/> knelt on one side, and, leaning her face
                    upon the bed, <reg orig="en-|deavored">endeavored</reg>
                    <lb/> in vain to smother her sobs. I sat on the other <lb/> motionless, and
                    holding the passive and withered hand of the <lb/> sufferer.</p>
                <p>I watched with ineffable solicitude the return of life. It <lb/> returned, at
                    length, but merely to betray symptoms that it <lb/> would speedily depart
                    forever. For a time my faculties <lb/> were palsied, and I was made an impotent
                    spectator of the <lb/> ruin that environed me. This pusillanimity quickly gave
                    <lb/> way to resolutions and reflections better suited to the <reg
                        orig="exi-|gencies">exigencies</reg>
                    <lb/> of the time.</p>
                <p>The first impulse was to summon a physician, but it was <lb/> evident that the
                    patient had been sinking by slow degrees to <lb/> this state, and that the last
                    struggle had begun. Nothing <lb/> remained but to watch her while expiring, and
                    perform for <lb/> her, when dead, the rites of interment. The survivor was <lb/>
                    capable of consolation and of succor. I went to her and <lb/> drew her gently
                    into another apartment. The old man, <lb/> tremulous and wonderstruck, seemed
                    anxious to perform <lb/> some service. I directed him to kindle a fire in
                    Eliza's <lb/> chamber. Meanwhile I persuaded my gentle friend to <reg
                        orig="re-|main">remain</reg>
                    <lb/> in this chamber, and resign to me the performance of <lb/> every office
                    which her sister's condition required. I sat <reg orig="be-|side">beside</reg>
                    <lb/> the bed of the dying till the mortal struggle was past.</p>
                <p>I perceived that the house had no inhabitant besides the <lb/> two females and
                    the old man. I went in search of the latter, <lb/> and found him crouched as
                    before, at the kitchen fire, <lb/> smoking his pipe. I placed myself on the same
                    bench, and <lb/> entered into conversation with him.</p>
                <p>I gathered from him that he had, for many years, been <lb/> Mr. Hadwin's servant.
                    That lately he had cultivated a <lb/> small farm in this neighborhood for his
                    own advantage. <reg orig="Stop-|ping">Stopping</reg>
                    <lb/> one day in October, at the tavern, he heard that his old <lb/> master had
                    lately been in the city, had caught <hi rend="italic">the fever,</hi> and <lb/>
                    after his return had died with it. The moment he became <lb/> sick, his servants
                    fled from the house, and the neighbors <reg orig="re-|fused">refused</reg>
                    <lb/> to approach it. The task of attending his sick bed, <lb/> was allotted to
                    his daughters, and it was by their hands that <lb/> his grave was dug, and his
                    body covered with earth. The <lb/>
                    <pb n="54" entity="eaf033v2_0263" pid="uva-lib:349570"/> same terror of
                    infection existed after his death as before, <lb/> and these hapless females
                    were deserted by all mankind.</p>
                <p>Old Caleb was no sooner informed of these particulars, <lb/> than he hurried to
                    the house, and had since continued in <lb/> their service. His heart was kind,
                    but it was easily seen that <lb/> his skill extended only to execute the
                    directions of another. <lb/> Grief for the death of Wallace, and her father,
                    preyed upon <lb/> the health of the elder daughter. The younger became <lb/> her
                    nurse, and Caleb was always at hand to execute any <lb/> orders, the performance
                    of which was on a level with his <lb/> understanding. Their neighbors had not
                    withheld their good <lb/> offices, but they were still terrified and estranged
                    by the <lb/> phantoms of pestilence.</p>
                <p>During the last week Susan had been too weak to rise <lb/> from her bed, yet such
                    was the energy communicated by <lb/> the tidings that Wallace was alive, and had
                    returned, that <lb/> she leaped upon her feet and rushed down stairs. How <lb/>
                    little did that man deserve so strenuous and immortal an <reg orig="af-|fection"
                        >affection</reg>.</p>
                <p>I would not allow myself to ponder on the sufferings of <lb/> these women. I
                    endeavored to think only of the best <reg orig="ex-|pedients">expedients</reg>
                    <lb/> for putting an end to these calamities. After a <lb/> moment's
                    deliberation, I determined to go to a house at <lb/> some miles distance; the
                    dwelling of one, who, though not <lb/> exempt from the reigning panic, had shown
                    more generosity <lb/> towards these unhappy girls than others. During my former
                    <lb/> abode in this district, I had ascertained his character, and <lb/> found
                    him to be compassionate and liberal.</p>
                <p>Overpowered by fatigue and watching, Susan was no <lb/> sooner relieved by my
                    presence, of some portion of her <lb/> cares, than she sunk into profound
                    slumber. I directed <lb/> Caleb to watch the house till my return, which should
                    be <lb/> before midnight, and then set out for the dwelling of Mr. <lb/>
                    Ellis.</p>
                <p>The weather was temperate and moist, and rendered the <lb/> footing of the
                    meadows extremely difficult. The ground <lb/> that had lately been frozen and
                    covered with snow, was <lb/> now changed into gullies and pools, and this was no
                    time to <lb/> be fastidious in the choice of paths. A brook, swelled by <lb/>
                    the recent <hi rend="italic">thaw,</hi> was likewise to be passed. The rail
                    which <lb/> I had formerly placed over it by way of bridge, had <reg
                        orig="disap-|peared">disappeared</reg>, <lb/>
                    <pb n="55" entity="eaf033v2_0264" pid="uva-lib:349571"/> and I was obliged to
                    wade through it. At length I <lb/> approached the house to which I was
                    going.</p>
                <p>At so late an hour, farmers and farmer's servants are <lb/> usually abed, and
                    their threshold is entrusted to their <reg orig="watch-|dogs">watchdogs</reg>.
                    <lb/> Two belonged to Mr. Ellis, whose ferocity and <reg orig="vigi-|lance"
                        >vigilance</reg>
                    <lb/> were truly formidable to a stranger, but I hoped that in <lb/> me they
                    would recognise an old acquaintance, and suffer <lb/> me to approach. In this I
                    was not mistaken. Though my <lb/> person could not be distinctly seen by
                    star-light, they seemed <lb/> to scent me from afar, and met me with a thousand
                    caresses.</p>
                <p>Approaching the house, I perceived that its tenants were <lb/> retired to their
                    repose. This I expected, and hastened to <lb/> awaken Mr. Ellis, by knocking
                    briskly at the door. <reg orig="Pre-|sently">Presently</reg>
                    <lb/> he looked out of a window above, and in answer to <lb/> his inquiries, in
                    which impatience at being so unseasonably <lb/> disturbed, was mingled with
                    anxiety, I told him my name, <lb/> and entreated him to come down and allow me a
                    few minutes <lb/> conversation. He speedily dressed himself, and opening <lb/>
                    the kitchen door, we seated ourselves before the fire.</p>
                <p>My appearance was sufficiently adapted to excite his <reg orig="won-|der"
                        >wonder</reg>; <lb/> he had heard of my elopement from the house of <lb/>
                    Mr. Hadwin, he was a stranger to the motives that prompted <lb/> my departure,
                    and to the events that had befallen me, and no <lb/> interview was more distant
                    from his expectations than the <lb/> present. His curiosity was written in his
                    features, but this <lb/> was no time to gratify his curiosity. The end that I
                    now <lb/> had in view, was to procure accommodation for Eliza <reg
                        orig="Had-|win">Hadwin</reg>
                    <lb/> in this man's house. For this purpose it was my duty <lb/> to describe
                    with simplicity and truth, the inconveniences <lb/> which at present surrounded
                    her, and to relate all that had <lb/> happened since my arrival.</p>
                <p>I perceived that my tale excited his compassion, and I <lb/> continued with new
                    zeal to paint to him the helplessness of <lb/> this girl. The death of her
                    father and sister left her the <lb/> property of this farm. Her sex and age
                    disqualified her for <lb/> superintending the harvest field and the threshing
                    floor; and <lb/> no expedient was left, but to lease the land to another, and,
                    <lb/> taking up her abode in the family of some kinsman or friend, <lb/> to
                    subsist, as she might easily do, upon the rent. <reg orig="Mean-|while"
                        >Meanwhile</reg>
                    <lb/> her continuance in this house was equally useless and <lb/>
                    <pb n="56" entity="eaf033v2_0265" pid="uva-lib:349572"/> dangerous, and I
                    insinuated to my companion the propriety <lb/> of immediately removing her to
                    his own.</p>
                <p>Some hesitation and reluctance appeared in him, which <lb/> I immediately
                    ascribed to an absurd dread of infection. I <lb/> endeavored, by appealing to
                    his reason, as well as to his pity, <lb/> to conquer this dread. I pointed out
                    the true cause of the <lb/> death of the elder daughter, and assured him the
                    youngest <lb/> knew no indisposition but that which arose from distress. I <lb/>
                    offered to save him from any hazard that might attend his <lb/> approaching the
                    house, by accompanying her hither myself. <lb/> All that her safety required was
                    that his doors should <lb/> not be shut against her when she presented herself
                    before <lb/> them.</p>
                <p>Still he was fearful and reluctant; and, at length, <reg orig="men-|tioned"
                        >mentioned</reg>
                    <lb/> that her uncle resided not more than sixteen miles <lb/> farther; that he
                    was her natural protector, and he dared <lb/> to say would find no difficulty in
                    admitting her into his <lb/> house. For his part, there might be reason in what
                    I said, <lb/> but he could not bring himself to think but that there was <lb/>
                    still some danger of <hi rend="italic">the fever.</hi> It was right to assist
                    people <lb/> in distress, to be sure; but to risk his own life he did not <lb/>
                    think to be his duty. He was no relation of the family, and <lb/> it was the
                    duty of relations to help each other. Her uncle <lb/> was the proper person to
                    assist her, and no doubt he would <lb/> be as willing as able.</p>
                <p>The marks of dubiousness and indecision which <reg orig="accompa-|nied"
                        >accompanied</reg>
                    <lb/> these words, encouraged me in endeavoring to subdue <lb/> his scruples.
                    The increase of his aversion to my scheme <lb/> kept pace with my remonstrances,
                    and he finally declared <lb/> that he would, on no account, consent to it.</p>
                <p>Ellis was by no means hard of heart. His <reg orig="determina-|tion"
                        >determination</reg>
                    <lb/> did not prove the coldness of his charity, but merely <lb/> the strength
                    of his fears. He was himself an object more <lb/> of compassion than of anger;
                    and he acted like the man, <lb/> whose fear of death prompts him to push his
                    companion <lb/> from the plank which saved him from drowning, but which <lb/> is
                    unable to sustain both. Finding him invincible to my <lb/> entreaties, I thought
                    upon the expedient which he <reg orig="suggest-|ed">suggested</reg>
                    <lb/> of seeking the protection of her uncle. It was true, <lb/> that the loss
                    of parents had rendered her uncle her legal <lb/> protector. His knowledge of
                    the world; his house, and <lb/>

                    </pb> property, and influence would, perhaps, fit him for this <lb/> office in a
                    more eminent degree than I was fitted. To seek <lb/> a different asylum might,
                    indeed, be unjust to both, and, <lb/> after some reflection, I not only
                    dismissed the regret which <lb/> Ellis's refusal had given me, but even thanked
                    him for the <lb/> intelligence and counsel which he had afforded me. I took
                    <lb/> leave of him, and hastened back to Hadwin's.</p>
                <p>Eliza, by Caleb's report, was still asleep. There was <lb/> no urgent necessity
                    for awakening her; but something was <lb/> forthwith to be done with regard to
                    the unhappy girl that <lb/> was dead. The proceeding incumbent on us was
                    obvious. <lb/> All that remained was to dig a grave, and to deposit the <reg
                        orig="re-|mains">remains</reg>
                    <lb/> with as much solemnity and decency as the time <lb/> would permit. There
                    were two methods of doing this. I <lb/> might wait till the next day; till a
                    coffin could be made <lb/> and conveyed hither; till the woman, whose trade it
                    was to <lb/> make and put on the habiliments assigned by custom to the <lb/>
                    dead, could be sought out and hired to attend; till kindred, <lb/> friends, and
                    neighbors could be summoned to the obsequies; <lb/> till a carriage were
                    provided to remove the body to a <reg orig="bury-|ing">burying</reg>
                    <lb/> ground, belonging to a meeting-house, and five miles <lb/> distant; till
                    those whose trade it was to dig graves, had <reg orig="pre-|pared"
                        >prepared</reg>
                    <lb/> one, within the sacred inclosure, for her reception; <lb/> or, neglecting
                    this toilsome, tedious, and expensive <reg orig="ceremo-|nial">ceremonial</reg>,
                    <lb/> I might seek the grave of Hadwin, and lay the daughter <lb/> by the side
                    of her parent.</p>
                <p>Perhaps I was wrong in my preference of the latter <lb/> mode. The customs of
                    burial may, in most cases, he in <lb/> themselves proper. If the customs he
                    absurd, yet it may <lb/> be generally proper to adhere to them; but doubtless,
                    there <lb/> are cases in which it is our duty to omit them. I conceived <lb/>
                    the present case to be such a one.</p>
                <p>The season was bleak and inclement. Much time, <lb/> labor, and expense would be
                    required to go through the <lb/> customary rites. There was none but myself to
                    perform <lb/> these, and I had not the suitable means. The misery of <lb/> Eliza
                    would only be prolonged by adhering to these forms; <lb/> and her fortune he
                    needlessly diminished, by the expenses <lb/> unavoidably to be incurred.</p>
                <p>After musing upon these ideas for some time, I rose from <lb/>
                    <pb n="58" entity="eaf033v2_0267" pid="uva-lib:349574"/> my seat, and desired
                    Caleb to follow me. We proceeded <lb/> to an outer shed where farmers' tools
                    used to be kept. I <lb/> supplied him and myself with a spade, and requested him
                    <lb/> to lead me to the spot where Mr. Hadwin was laid.</p>
                <p>He betrayed some hesitation to comply, and appeared <lb/> struck with some degree
                    of alarm, as if my purpose had <lb/> been to molest, instead of securing, the
                    repose of the dead. <lb/> I removed his doubts by explaining my intentions, but
                    he <lb/> was scarcely less shocked, on discovering the truth, than he <lb/> had
                    been alarmed by his first suspicions. He stammered <lb/> out his objections to
                    my scheme. There was but one mode <lb/> of burial he thought that was decent and
                    proper, and he <lb/> could not be free to assist me in pursuing any other
                    mode.</p>
                <p>Perhaps Caleb's aversion to the scheme might have been <lb/> easily overcome, but
                    I reflected that a mind like his was at <lb/> once flexible and obstinate. He
                    might yield to arguments <lb/> and entreaties, and act by their immediate
                    impulse; but <lb/> the impulse passed away in a moment, old and habitual <lb/>
                    convictions were resumed, and his deviation from the <lb/> beaten track would be
                    merely productive of compunction. <lb/> His aid, on the present occasion, though
                    of some use, was <lb/> by no means indispensable. I forbore to solicit his <reg
                        orig="con-|currence">concurrence</reg>, <lb/> or even to vanquish the
                    scruples he entertained <lb/> against directing me to the grave of Hadwin. It
                    was a <lb/> groundless superstition that made one spot more suitable for <lb/>
                    this purpose than another. I desired Caleb, in a mild tone, <lb/> to return to
                    the kitchen, and leave me to act as I thought <lb/> proper. I then proceeded to
                    the orchard.</p>
                <p>One corner of this field was somewhat above the level of <lb/> the rest. The
                    tallest tree of the group grew there, and there <lb/> I had formerly placed a
                    bench, and made it my retreat at <reg orig="pe-|riods">periods</reg>
                    <lb/> of leisure. It had been recommended by its sequestered <lb/> situation,
                    its luxuriant verdure, and profound quiet. On one <lb/> side was a potatoe
                    field, on the other a <hi rend="italic">melon patch;</hi> and <lb/> before me,
                    in rows, some hundreds of apple trees. Here <lb/> I was accustomed to seek the
                    benefits of contemplation, and <lb/> study the manuscripts of Lodi. A few months
                    had passed <lb/> since I had last visited this spot. What revolutions had <lb/>
                    since occurred, and how gloomily contrasted was my <reg orig="pre-|sent"
                        >present</reg>
                    <lb/> purpose with what had formerly led me hither!</p>
                <p>In this spot I had hastily determined to dig the grave of <lb/>
                    <pb n="59" entity="eaf033v2_0268" pid="uva-lib:349575"/> Susan. The grave was
                    dug. All that I desired was a <lb/> cavity of sufficient dimensions to receive
                    her. This being <lb/> made, I returned to the house, lifted the corpse in my
                    arms, <lb/> and bore it without delay to the spot. Caleb seated in the <lb/>
                    kitchen, and Eliza asleep in her chamber, were wholly <reg orig="un-|apprized"
                        >unapprized</reg>
                    <lb/> of my motions. The grave was covered, the spade <lb/> reposited under the
                    shed, and my seat by the kitchen fire <lb/> resumed in a time apparently too
                    short for so solemn and <lb/> momentous a transaction.</p>
                <p>I look back upon this incident with emotions not easily <lb/> described. It seems
                    as if I acted with too much <reg orig="precipita-|tion">precipitation</reg>;
                    <lb/> as if insensibility, and not reason, had occasioned that <lb/> clearness
                    of conceptions, and bestowed that firmness of <lb/> muscles, which I then
                    experienced. I neither trembled nor <lb/> wavered in my purpose. I bore in my
                    arms the being <lb/> whom I had known and loved, through the whistling gale
                    <lb/> and intense darkness of a winter's night; I heaped earth <lb/> upon her
                    limbs, and covered them from human observation, <lb/> without fluctuations or
                    tremors, though not without feelings <lb/> that were awful and sublime.</p>
                <p>Perhaps some part of my steadfastness was owing to my <lb/> late experience, and
                    some minds may be more easily inured <lb/> to perilous emergences than others.
                    If reason acquires <lb/> strength only by the diminution of sensibility, perhaps
                    it is <lb/> just for sensibility to be diminished.</p>

                <p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> safety of Eliza was the object that now occupied
                    <lb/> my cares. To have slept, after her example, had been <lb/> most proper,
                    but my uncertainty with regard to her fate, and <lb/> my desire to conduct her
                    to some other home, kept my <lb/> thoughts in perpetual motion. I waited with
                    impatience till <lb/> she should awake and allow me to consult with her on plans
                    <lb/> for futurity.</p>
                <p>Her sleep terminated not till the next day had arisen. <lb/> Having recovered the
                    remembrance of what had lately <reg orig="hap-|pened">happened</reg>, <lb/> she
                    inquired for her sister. She wanted to view <lb/>
                    <pb n="60" entity="eaf033v2_0269" pid="uva-lib:349576"/> once more the face, and
                    kiss the lips, of her beloved Susan. <lb/> Some relief to her anguish she
                    expected to derive from this <lb/> privilege.</p>
                <p>When informed of the truth, when convinced that Susan <lb/> had disappeared
                    forever, she broke forth into fresh passion. <lb/> It seemed as if her loss was
                    not hopeless or complete as <lb/> long as she was suffered to behold the face of
                    her friend <lb/> and to touch her lips. She accused me of acting without <lb/>
                    warrant and without justice; of defrauding her of her <lb/> dearest and only
                    consolation; and of treating her sister's <lb/> sacred remains with barbarous
                    indifference and rudeness.</p>
                <p>I explained in the gentlest terms the reasons of my <reg orig="con-|duct"
                        >conduct</reg>. <lb/> I was not surprised or vexed, that she, at first,
                    treated <lb/> them as futile, and as heightening my offence. Such was <lb/> the
                    impulse of a grief, which was properly excited by her <lb/> loss. To be tranquil
                    and steadfast, in the midst of the usual <lb/> causes of impetuosity and agony,
                    is either the prerogative <lb/> of wisdom that sublimes itself above all selfish
                        <reg orig="considera-|tions">considerations</reg>, <lb/> or the badge of
                    giddy and unfeeling folly.</p>
                <p>The torrent was at length exhausted. Upbraiding was <lb/> at an end; and
                    gratitude, and tenderness, and implicit <reg orig="ac-|quiescence"
                        >acquiescence</reg>
                    <lb/> in any scheme which my prudence should <reg orig="sug-|gest"
                    >suggest</reg>, <lb/> succeeded. I mentioned her uncle as one to whom it <lb/>
                    would be proper, in her present distress, to apply.</p>
                <p>She started and betrayed uneasiness at this name. It <lb/> was evident that she
                    by no means concurred with me in my <lb/> notions of propriety; that she thought
                    with aversion of <reg orig="seek-|ing">seeking</reg>
                    <lb/> her uncle's protection. I requested her to state her <reg
                        orig="ob-|jections">objections</reg>
                    <lb/> to this scheme, or to mention any other which she <lb/> thought
                    preferable.</p>
                <p>She knew no body. She had not a friend in the world <lb/> but myself. She had
                    never been out of her father's house. <lb/> She had no relation but her uncle
                    Philip, and he&mdash;she could <lb/> not live with him. I must not insist upon
                    her going to his <lb/> house. It was not the place for her. She should never be
                    <lb/> happy there.</p>
                <p>I was, at first, inclined to suspect in my friend some <reg orig="ca-|pricious"
                        >capricious</reg>
                    <lb/> and groundless antipathy. I desired her to explain <lb/> what in her
                    uncle's character made him so obnoxious. She <lb/> refused to be more explicit,
                    and persisted in thinking that <lb/> his house was no suitable abode for
                    her.</p>

                </pb>
                <p>Finding her, in this respect, invincible, I sought for some <lb/> other
                    expedient. Might she not easily be accommodated <lb/> as a boarder in the city,
                    or some village, or in a remote <lb/> quarter of the country? Ellis, her nearest
                    and most opulent <lb/> neighbor, had refused to receive her; but there were
                    others <lb/> who had not his fears. There were others, within the <reg
                        orig="com-|pass">compass</reg>
                    <lb/> of a day's journey, who were strangers to the cause of <lb/> Hadwin's
                    death; but would it not be culpable to take <reg orig="ad-|vantage"
                        >advantage</reg>
                    <lb/> of that ignorance? Their compliance ought not to <lb/> be the result of
                    deception.</p>
                <p>While thus engaged, the incidents of my late journey <reg orig="re-|curred"
                        >recurred</reg>
                    <lb/> to my remembrance, and I asked, is not the honest <lb/> woman, who
                    entertained Wallace, just such a person as that <lb/> of whom I am in search?
                    Her treatment of Wallace shews <lb/> her to be exempt from chimerical fears,
                    proves that she has <lb/> room in her house for an occasional inmate.</p>
                <p>Encouraged by these views, I told my weeping <reg orig="compan-|ion"
                        >companion</reg>, <lb/> that I had recollected a family in which she would
                    be <lb/> kindly treated; and that, if she chose, we would not lose a <lb/>
                    moment in repairing thither. Horses, belonging to the farm, <lb/> grazed in the
                    meadows, and a couple of these would carry <lb/> us in a few hours to the place
                    which I had selected for her <lb/> residence. On her eagerly assenting to this
                    proposal, I <reg orig="in-|quired">inquired</reg>
                    <lb/> in whose care, and in what state, our present <reg orig="habita-|tion"
                        >habitation</reg>
                    <lb/> should be left.</p>
                <p>The father's property now belonged to the daughter. <lb/> Eliza's mind was quick,
                    active, and sagacious; but her total <lb/> inexperience gave her sometimes the
                    appearance of folly. <lb/> She was eager to fly from this house, and to resign
                    herself <lb/> and her property, without limitation or condition, to my <reg
                        orig="con-|trol">control</reg>. <lb/> Our intercourse had been short, but
                    she relied on my <lb/> protection and counsel as absolutely as she had been <reg
                        orig="accus-|tomed">accustomed</reg>
                    <lb/> to do upon her father's.</p>
                <p>She knew not what answer to make to my inquiry. <reg orig="What-|ever"
                        >Whatever</reg>
                    <lb/> I pleased to do was the best. What did I think ought <lb/> to be done?</p>
                <p>Ah! thought I, sweet, artless, and simple girl! how wouldst <lb/> thou have
                    fared, if Heaven had not sent me to thy succor? <lb/> There are beings in the
                    world who would make a selfish <lb/> use of thy confidence; who would beguile
                    thee at once of <lb/>
                    <pb n="62" entity="eaf033v2_0271" pid="uva-lib:349578"/> innocence and property.
                    Such am not I. Thy welfare is <lb/> a precious deposit, and no father or brother
                    could watch <lb/> over it with more solicitude than I will do.</p>
                <p>I was aware that Mr. Hadwin might have fixed the <reg orig="des-|tination"
                        >destination</reg>
                    <lb/> of his property, and the guardianship of his daughters, <lb/> by will. On
                    suggesting this to my friend, it instantly <reg orig="re-|minded">reminded</reg>
                    <lb/> her of an incident that took place after his last return <lb/> from the
                    city. He had drawn up his will, and gave it into <lb/> Susan's possession, who
                    placed it in a drawer, whence it was <lb/> now taken by my friend.</p>
                <p>By this will his property was now found to be bequeathed <lb/> to his two
                    daughters; and his brother, Philip Hadwin, was <lb/> named executor, and
                    guardian to his daughters till they <lb/> should be twenty years old. This name
                    was no sooner <lb/> heard by my friend, than she exclaimed, in a tone of
                    affright, <lb/> executor! My uncle! What is that? What power does <lb/> that
                    give him?</p>
                <p>I know not exactly the power of executors. He will, <reg orig="doubt-|less"
                        >doubtless</reg>, <lb/> have possession of your property till you are twenty
                    <lb/> years of age. Your person will likewise be under his care <lb/> till that
                    time.</p>
                <p>Must he decide where I am to live?</p>
                <p>He is vested with all the power of a father.</p>
                <p>This assurance excited the deepest consternation. She <lb/> fixed her eyes on the
                    ground, and was lost, for a time, in <lb/> the deepest reverie. Recovering, at
                    length, she said, with a <lb/> sigh, what if my father had made no will?</p>
                <p>In that case, a guardian could not be dispensed with, but <lb/> the right of
                    naming him would belong to yourself.</p>
                <p>And my uncle would have nothing to do with my affairs?</p>
                <p>I am no lawyer, said I; but I presume all authority over <lb/> your person and
                    property would devolve upon the guardian <lb/> of your own choice.</p>
                <p>Then I am free. Saying this, with a sudden motion, she <lb/> tore in several
                    pieces the will, which, during this dialogue, she <lb/> had held in her hand,
                    and threw the fragments into the fire.</p>
                <p>No action was more unexpected to me than this. My <lb/> astonishment hindered me
                    from attempting to rescue the <reg orig="pa-|per">paper</reg>
                    <lb/> from the flames. It was consumed in a moment. I <lb/> was at a loss in
                    what manner to regard this sacrifice. It <lb/> denoted a force of mind little in
                    unison with that simplicity <lb/>
                    <pb n="63" entity="eaf033v2_0272" pid="uva-lib:349579"/> and helplessness which
                    this girl had hitherto displayed. It <lb/> argued the deepest apprehensions of
                    mistreatment from her <lb/> uncle. Whether his conduct had justified this
                    violent <reg orig="an-|tipathy">antipathy</reg>, <lb/> I had no means of
                    judging. Mr. Hadwin's choice <lb/> of him, as his executor, was certainly one
                    proof of his <reg orig="in-|tegrity">integrity</reg>.</p>
                <p>My abstraction was noticed by Eliza, with visible anxiety. <lb/> It was plain,
                    that she dreaded the impression which this act <lb/> of seeming temerity had
                    made upon me. Do not be angry <lb/> with me, said she; perhaps I have been
                    wrong, but I could <lb/> not help it. I will have but one guardian and one
                    protector.</p>
                <p>The deed was irrevocable. In my present ignorance of <lb/> the domestic history
                    of the Hadwins, I was unqualified to <lb/> judge how far circumstances might
                    extenuate or justify the <lb/> act. On both accounts, therefore, it was improper
                    to <reg orig="ex-|patiate">expatiate</reg>
                    <lb/> upon it.</p>
                <p>It was concluded to leave the care of the house to honest <lb/> Caleb; to fasten
                    closets and drawers, and, carrying away <lb/> the money which was found in one
                    of them, and which <lb/> amounted to no inconsiderable sum, to repair to the
                    house <lb/> formerly mentioned. The air was cold; a heavy snow <lb/> began to
                    fall in the night; the wind blew tempestuously; <lb/> and we were compelled to
                    confront it.</p>
                <p>In leaving her dwelling, in which she had spent her whole <lb/> life, the unhappy
                    girl gave way afresh to her sorrow. It <lb/> made her feeble and helpless. When
                    placed upon the <lb/> horse, she was scarcely able to maintain her seat. Already
                    <lb/> chilled by the cold, blinded by the drifting snow, and cut by <lb/> the
                    blast, all my remonstrances were needed to inspire her <lb/> with
                    resolution.</p>
                <p>I am not accustomed to regard the elements, or suffer <lb/> them to retard or
                    divert me from any design that I have <lb/> formed. I had overlooked the weak
                    and delicate frame of <lb/> my companion, and made no account of her being less
                    able <lb/> to support cold and fatigue than myself. It was not till we <lb/> had
                    made some progress in our way, that I began to view, <lb/> in their true light,
                    the obstacles that were to be encountered. <lb/> I conceived it, however, too
                    late to retreat, and endeavored <lb/> to push on with speed.</p>
                <p>My companion was a skilful rider, but her steed was <reg orig="re-|fractory"
                        >refractory</reg>
                    <lb/> and unmanageable. She was able, however, to <lb/>
                    <pb n="64" entity="eaf033v2_0273" pid="uva-lib:349580"/> curb his spirit till we
                    had proceeded ten or twelve miles <lb/> from Malverton. The wind and the cold
                    became too <reg orig="vio-|lent">violent</reg>
                    <lb/> to be longer endured, and I resolved to stop at the first <lb/> house
                    which should present itself to my view, for the sake <lb/> of refreshment and
                    warmth.</p>
                <p>We now entered a wood of some extent, at the <reg orig="termina-|tion"
                        >termination</reg>
                    <lb/> of which I remembered that a dwelling stood. To <lb/> pass this wood,
                    therefore, with expedition, was all that <reg orig="re-|mained">remained</reg>
                    <lb/> before we could reach a hospitable asylum. I <lb/> endeavored to sustain,
                    by this information, the sinking spirits <lb/> of my companion. While busy in
                    conversing with her, a <lb/> blast of irresistible force twisted off the highest
                    branch of a <lb/> tree before us. It fell in the midst of the road, at the <reg
                        orig="dis-|tance">distance</reg>
                    <lb/> of a few feet from her horse's head. Terrified by <lb/> this accident, the
                    horse started from the path, and, rushing <lb/> into the wood, in a moment threw
                    himself and his rider on <lb/> the ground, by encountering the rugged stock of
                    an oak.</p>
                <p>I dismounted and flew to her succor. The snow was <lb/> already dyed with the
                    blood which flowed from some wound <lb/> in her head, and she lay without sense
                    or motion. My <reg orig="ter-|rors">terrors</reg>
                    <lb/> did not hinder me from anxiously searching for the hurt <lb/> which was
                    received, and ascertaining the extent of the <reg orig="in-|jury">injury</reg>.
                    <lb/> Her forehead was considerably bruised; but, to my <lb/> unspeakable joy,
                    the blood flowed from the nostrils, and <lb/> was, therefore, to be regarded as
                    no mortal symptom.</p>
                <p>I lifted her in my arms, and looked around me for some <lb/> means of relief. The
                    house at which I proposed to stop <lb/> was upwards of a mile distant. I
                    remembered none that <lb/> was nearer. To place the wounded girl on my own <lb/>
                    horse, and proceed gently to the house in question, was <lb/> the sole
                    expedient; but, at present, she was senseless, and <lb/> might, on recovering,
                    be too feeble to sustain her own <lb/> weight.</p>
                <p>To recall her to life was my first duty; but I was <reg orig="pow-|erless"
                        >powerless</reg>, <lb/> or unacquainted with the means. I gazed upon her
                    <lb/> features, and endeavored, by pressing her in my arms, to <lb/> inspire her
                    with some warmth. I looked towards the road, <lb/> and listened for the wished
                    for sound of some carriage that <lb/> might be prevailed on to stop and receive
                    her. Nothing <lb/> was more improbable than that either pleasure or business
                    <lb/> would induce men to encounter so chilling and vehement a <lb/>
                    <pb n="65" entity="eaf033v2_0274" pid="uva-lib:349581"/> blast. To be lighted on
                    by some traveller was, therefore, <lb/> a hopeless event.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, Eliza's swoon continued, and my alarm <reg orig="in-|creased"
                        >increased</reg>. <lb/> What effect her half-frozen blood would have in
                    <lb/> prolonging this condition, or preventing her return to life, <lb/>
                    awakened the deepest apprehensions. I left the wood, still <lb/> bearing her in
                    my arms, and reentered the road, from the <lb/> desire of descrying, as soon as
                    possible, the coming <reg orig="pas-|senger">passenger</reg>. <lb/> I looked
                    this way and that, and again listened. <lb/> Nothing but the sweeping blast,
                    rent and falling branches, <lb/> and snow that filled and obscured the air, were
                    perceivable. <lb/> Each moment retarded the course of my own blood, and <lb/>
                    stiffened my sinews, and made the state of my companion <lb/> more desperate.
                    How was I to act? To perish myself <lb/> or see her perish, was an ignoble fate;
                    courage and activity <lb/> were still able to avert it. My horse stood near,
                    docile and <lb/> obsequious; to mount him and to proceed on my way, <lb/>
                    holding my lifeless burthen in my arms, was all that <reg orig="re-|mained"
                        >remained</reg>.</p>
                <p>At this moment my attention was called by several voices, <lb/> issuing from the
                    wood. It was the note of gaiety and glee. <lb/> Presently a sleigh, with several
                    persons of both sexes, <reg orig="ap-|peared">appeared</reg>, <lb/> in a road
                    which led through the forest into that in <lb/> which I stood. They moved at a
                    quick pace, but their <lb/> voices were hushed, and they checked the speed of
                    their <lb/> horses on discovering us. No occurrence was more <reg
                        orig="auspi-|cious">auspicious</reg>
                    <lb/> than this; for I relied with perfect confidence on the <lb/> benevolence
                    of these persons, and as soon as they came <lb/> near, claimed their
                    assistance.</p>
                <p>My story was listened to with sympathy, and one of the <lb/> young men, leaping
                    from the sleigh, assisted me in placing <lb/> Eliza in the place which he had
                    left. A female, of sweet <reg orig="as-|pect">aspect</reg>
                    <lb/> and engaging manners, insisted upon turning back and <lb/> hastening to
                    the house, where it seems her father resided, <lb/> and which the party had just
                    left. I rode after the sleigh, <lb/> which in a few minutes arrived at the
                    house. The dwelling <lb/> was spacious and neat, and a venerable man and woman,
                    <lb/> alarmed by the quick return of the young people, came <lb/> forth to know
                    the cause. They received their guest with <lb/> the utmost tenderness, and
                    provided her with all the <reg orig="accom-|modations">accommodations</reg>
                    <lb/> which her condition required. Their daughter <lb/>
                    <pb n="66" entity="eaf033v2_0275" pid="uva-lib:349582"/> relinquished the scheme
                    of pleasure in which she had been <lb/> engaged, and, compelling her companions
                    to depart without <lb/> her, remained to nurse and console the sick.</p>
                <p>A little time showed that no lasting injury had been <reg orig="suf-|fered"
                        >suffered</reg>. <lb/> Contusions, more troublesome than dangerous, and
                    <lb/> easily curable by such applications as rural and traditional <lb/> wisdom
                    has discovered, were the only consequences of the <lb/> fall. My mind, being
                    relieved from apprehensions on this <lb/> score, had leisure to reflect upon the
                    use which might be <lb/> made of the present state of things.</p>
                <p>When I remarked the structure of this house, and the <lb/> features and
                    deportment of its inhabitants, methought I <reg orig="dis-|cerned"
                        >discerned</reg>
                    <lb/> a powerful resemblance between this family and <lb/> Hadwin's. It seemed
                    as if some benignant power had led <lb/> us hither as to the most suitable
                    asylum that could be <reg orig="ob-|tained">obtained</reg>; <lb/> and, in order
                    to supply to the forlorn Eliza, the <lb/> place of those parents and that sister
                    she had lost, I <reg orig="con-|ceived">conceived</reg>, <lb/> that, if their
                    concurrence could be gained, no abode <lb/> was more suitable than this. No time
                    was to be lost in <lb/> gaining this concurrence. The curiosity of our host and
                    <lb/> hostess, whose name was Curling, speedily afforded me an <lb/> opportunity
                    to disclose the history and real situation of my <lb/> friend. There were no
                    motives to reserve or prevarication. <lb/> There was nothing which I did not
                    faithfully and <reg orig="circum-|stantially">circumstantially</reg>
                    <lb/> relate. I concluded with stating my wishes that <lb/> they would admit my
                    friend as a boarder into their house.</p>
                <p>The old man was warm in his concurrence. His wife <lb/> betrayed some scruples;
                    which, however, her husband's <lb/> arguments and mine removed. I did not even
                    suppress the <lb/> tenor and destruction of the will, and the antipathy which
                    <lb/> Eliza had conceived for her uncle, and which I declared <lb/> myself
                    unable to explain. It presently appeared that Mr. <lb/> Curling had some
                    knowledge of Philip Hadwin, and that <lb/> the latter had acquired the repute of
                    being obdurate and <lb/> profligate. He employed all means to accomplish his
                    selfish <lb/> ends, and would probably endeavor to usurp the property <lb/>
                    which his brother had left. To provide against his power <lb/> and his malice
                    would be particularly incumbent on us, and <lb/> my new friend readily promised
                    his assistance in the <reg orig="mea-|sures">measures</reg>
                    <lb/> which we should take to that end.</p>

                <p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> state of my feelings may be easily conceived to
                        <reg orig="con-|sist">consist</reg>
                    <lb/> of mixed, but on the whole, of agreeable sensations. <lb/> The death of
                    Hadwin and his elder daughter could not be <lb/> thought upon without keen
                    regrets. These it were useless <lb/> to indulge, and were outweighed by
                    reflections on the <reg orig="per-|sonal">personal</reg>
                    <lb/> security in which the survivor was now placed. It was <lb/> hurtful to
                    expend my unprofitable cares upon the dead, <lb/> while there existed one to
                    whom they could be of essential <lb/> benefit, and in whose happiness they would
                    find an ample <lb/> compensation.</p>
                <p>This happiness, however, was still incomplete. It was <lb/> still exposed to
                    hazard, and much remained to be done before <lb/> adequate provision was made
                    against the worst of evils, <reg orig="pov-|erty">poverty</reg>. <lb/> I now
                    found that Eliza, being only fifteen years old, <lb/> stood in need of a
                    guardian, and that the forms of law required <lb/> that some one should make
                    himself her father's administrator. <lb/> Mr. Curling being tolerably conversant
                    with these subjects, <lb/> pointed out the mode to be pursued, and engaged to
                    act on <lb/> this occasion as Eliza's friend.</p>
                <p>There was another topic on which my happiness, as well <lb/> as that of my
                    friend, required us to form some decision. I <lb/> formerly mentioned, that
                    during my abode at Malverton, I <lb/> had not been insensible to the attractions
                    of this girl. An <lb/> affection had stolen upon me, for which, it was easily
                        <reg orig="dis-|covered">discovered</reg>, <lb/> that I should not have been
                    denied a suitable <lb/> return. My reasons for stifling these emotions, at that
                    time, <lb/> have been mentioned. It may now be asked, what effect <lb/>
                    subsequent events had produced on my feelings, and how far <lb/> partaking and
                    relieving her distresses, had revived a passion <lb/> which may readily be
                    supposed to have been, at no time, <lb/> entirely extinguished.</p>
                <p>The impediments which then existed, were removed. Our <lb/> union would no longer
                    risk the resentment or sorrow of her <lb/> excellent parent. She had no longer a
                    sister to divide with <lb/> her the property of the farm, and make what was
                    sufficient <lb/> for both, when living together, too little for either
                    separately. <lb/> Her youth and simplicity required, beyond most others, a <lb/>
                    <pb n="68" entity="eaf033v2_0277" pid="uva-lib:349584"/> legal protector, and
                    her happiness was involved in the <reg orig="suc-|cess">success</reg>
                    <lb/> of those hopes which she took no pains to conceal.</p>
                <p>As to me, it seemed at first view, as if every incident <reg orig="con-|spired"
                        >conspired</reg>
                    <lb/> to determine my choice. Omitting all regard to the <lb/> happiness of
                    others, my own interest could not fail to <reg orig="re-|commend"
                        >recommend</reg>
                    <lb/> a scheme by which the precious benefits of <reg orig="com-|petence"
                        >competence</reg>
                    <lb/> and independence might be honestly obtained. The <lb/> excursions of my
                    fancy had sometimes carried me beyond <lb/> the bounds prescribed by my
                    situation, but they were, <reg orig="never-|theless">nevertheless</reg>, <lb/>
                    limited to that field to which I had once some <reg orig="pros-|pect"
                        >prospect</reg>
                    <lb/> of acquiring a title. All I wanted for the basis of my <lb/> gaudiest and
                    most dazzling structures, was an hundred acres <lb/> of plough land and meadow.
                    Here my spirit of <reg orig="improve-|ment">improvement</reg>, <lb/> my zeal to
                    invent and apply new maxims of household <lb/> luxury and convenience, new modes
                    and instruments of <reg orig="till-|age">tillage</reg>, <lb/> new arts connected
                    with orchard, garden and cornfield, <lb/> were supplied with abundant scope.
                    Though the want of <lb/> these would not benumb my activity, or take away
                    content, <lb/> the possession would confer exquisite and permanent <reg
                        orig="enjoy-|ments">enjoyments</reg>.</p>
                <p>My thoughts have ever hovered over the images of wife <lb/> and children with
                    more delight than over any other images. <lb/> My fancy was always active on
                    this theme, and its reveries <lb/> sufficiently ecstatic and glowing; but since
                    my intercourse <lb/> with this girl, my scattered visions were collected and
                        <reg orig="con-|centrated">concentrated</reg>. <lb/> I had now a form and
                    features before me, a sweet <lb/> and melodious voice vibrated in my ear, my
                    soul was filled, <lb/> as it were, with her lineaments and gestures, actions and
                    <lb/> looks. All ideas, possessing any relation to beauty or sex, <lb/> appeared
                    to assume this shape. They kept an immoveable <lb/> place in my mind, they
                    diffused around them an ineffable <lb/> complacency. Love is merely of value as
                    a prelude to a <lb/> more tender, intimate and sacred union. Was I not in love,
                    <lb/> and did I not pant after the irrevocable bonds, the boundless <lb/>
                    privileges of wedlock?</p>
                <p>The question which others might ask, I have asked <reg orig="my-|self"
                        >myself</reg>. <lb/> Was I not in love? I am really at a loss for an answer.
                    <lb/> There seemed to be irresistible weight in the reasons why I <lb/> should
                    refuse to marry, and even forbear to foster love in <lb/> my friend. I
                    considered my youth, my defective education <lb/> and my limited views. I had
                    passed from my cottage into <lb/>
                    <pb n="69" entity="eaf033v2_0278" pid="uva-lib:349585">
                        <fw type="sig" place="bottom-left">VOL. II. 7</fw>
                    </pb> the world. I had acquired even in my transient sojourn <lb/> among the
                    busy haunts of men, more knowledge than the <lb/> lucubrations and employments
                    of all my previous years had <lb/> conferred. Hence I might infer the childlike
                    immaturity of <lb/> my understanding, and the rapid progress I was still capable
                    <lb/> of making. Was this an age to form an irrevocable contract; <lb/> to
                    choose the companion of my future life, the associate of <lb/> my schemes of
                    intellectual and benevolent activity?</p>
                <p>I had reason to contemn my own acquisitions; but were <lb/> not those of Eliza
                    still more slender? Could I rely upon the <lb/> permanence of her equanimity and
                    her docility to my <reg orig="instruc-|tions">instructions</reg>? <lb/> What
                    qualities might not time unfold, and how little <lb/> was I qualified to
                    estimate the character of one, whom no <lb/> vicissitude or hardship had
                    approached before the death of <lb/> her father? Whose ignorance was, indeed,
                    great, when it <lb/> could justly be said even to exceed my own.</p>
                <p>Should I mix with the world, enrol myself in different <lb/> classes of society;
                    be a witness to new scenes; might not <lb/> my modes of judging undergo
                    essential variations? Might <lb/> I not gain the knowledge of beings whose
                    virtue was the gift <lb/> of experience and the growth of knowledge? Who joined
                    <lb/> to the modesty and charms of woman, the benefits of <reg
                        orig="educa-|tion">education</reg>, <lb/> the maturity and steadfastness of
                    age, and with whose <lb/> character and sentiments my own would be much more
                    <lb/> congenial than they could possibly be with the extreme <lb/> youth, rustic
                    simplicity and mental imperfections of Eliza <lb/> Hadwin?</p>
                <p>To say truth, I was now conscious of a revolution in my <lb/> mind. I can
                    scarcely assign its true cause. No tokens of <lb/> it appeared during my late
                    retreat to Malverton. <reg orig="Subse-|quent">Subsequent</reg>
                    <lb/> incidents, perhaps, joined with the influence of <reg orig="medi-|tation"
                        >meditation</reg>, <lb/> had generated new views. On my first visit to the
                    <lb/> city, I had met with nothing but scenes of folly, depravity <lb/> and
                    cunning. No wonder that the images connected with <lb/> the city, were
                    disastrous and gloomy; but my second visit <lb/> produced somewhat different
                    impressions. Maravegli, <reg orig="Est-|wick">Estwick</reg>, <lb/> Medlicote and
                    you, were beings who inspired <reg orig="venera-|tion">veneration</reg>
                    <lb/> and love. Your residence appeared to beautify and <lb/> consecrate this
                    spot, and gave birth to an opinion that if cities <lb/> are the chosen seats of
                    misery and vice, they are likewise <lb/>
                    <pb n="70" entity="eaf033v2_0279" pid="uva-lib:349586"/> the soil of all the
                    laudable and strenuous productions of <lb/> mind.</p>
                <p>My curiosity and thirst of knowledge had likewise <reg orig="receiv-|ed"
                        >received</reg>
                    <lb/> a new direction. Books and nanimate nature were cold <lb/> and lifeless
                    instructers. Men, and the works of men, were <lb/> the objects of rational
                    study, and our own eyes only could <lb/> communicate just conceptions of human
                    performances. The <lb/> influence of manners, professions, and social
                    institutions, could <lb/> be thoroughly known only by direct inspection.</p>
                <p>Competence, fixed property and a settled abode, rural <lb/> occupations and
                    conjugal pleasures, were justly to be prized; <lb/> but their value could be
                    known, and their benefits fully <reg orig="en-|joyed">enjoyed</reg>
                    <lb/> only by those who have tried all scenes; who have <lb/> mixed with all
                    classes and ranks; who have partaken of all <lb/> conditions; and who have
                    visited different hemispheres, and <lb/> climates, and nations. The next five or
                    eight years of my <lb/> life, should be devoted to activity and change; it
                    should be <lb/> a period of hardship, danger and privation; it should be <lb/>
                    my apprenticeship to fortitude and wisdom, and be <reg orig="employ-|ed"
                        >employed</reg>
                    <lb/> to fit me for the tranquil pleasures and steadfast exertions <lb/> of the
                    remainder of my life.</p>
                <p>In consequence of these reflections, I determined to <lb/> suppress that
                    tenderness which the company of Miss <reg orig="Had-|win">Hadwin</reg>
                    <lb/> produced, to remove any mistakes into which she had <lb/> fallen, and to
                    put it out of my power to claim from her more <lb/> than the dues of friendship.
                    All ambiguities, in a case like <lb/> this, and all delays were hurtful. She was
                    not exempt <lb/> from passion, but this passion I thought was young, and easily
                    <lb/> extinguished.</p>
                <p>In a short time her health was restored, and her grief <lb/> melted down into a
                    tender melancholy. I chose a suitable <lb/> moment, when not embarrassed by the
                    presence of others, to <lb/> reveal my thoughts. My disclosure was ingenuous and
                    <lb/> perfect. I laid before her the whole train of my thoughts, <lb/> nearly in
                    the order, though in different and more copious <lb/> terms than those in which
                    I have just explained them to you. <lb/> I concealed nothing. The impression
                    which her artless <reg orig="love-|liness">loveliness</reg>
                    <lb/> had made upon me at Malverton; my motives for <lb/> estranging myself from
                    her society; the nature of my present <lb/> feelings with regard to her, and my
                    belief of the state of her <lb/> heart; the reasonings into which I had entered;
                    the <reg orig="ad-|vantages">advantages</reg>
                    <lb/>
                    <pb n="71" entity="eaf033v2_0280" pid="uva-lib:349587"/> of wedlock and its
                    inconveniences; and, finally, <lb/> the resolution I had formed of seeking the
                    city, and perhaps, <lb/> of crossing the ocean, were minutely detailed.</p>
                <p>She interrupted me not, but changing looks, blushes, <reg orig="flut-|terings"
                        >flutterings</reg>
                    <lb/> and sighs, shewed her to be deeply and variously <reg orig="af-|fected"
                        >affected</reg>
                    <lb/> by my discourse. I paused for some observation or <lb/> comment. She
                    seemed conscious of my expectation, but <lb/> had no power to speak,
                    Overpowered, at length, by her <lb/> emotions, she burst into tears.</p>
                <p>I was at a loss in what manner to construe these <reg orig="symp-|toms"
                        >symptoms</reg>. <lb/> I waited till her vehemence was somewhat subsided,
                    <lb/> and then said&mdash;what think you of my schemes? Your <lb/> approbation
                    is of some moment; do you approve of them or <lb/> not?</p>
                <p>This question excited some little resentment, and she <lb/> answered&mdash;you
                    have left me nothing to say. Go and be <lb/> happy; no matter what becomes of
                    me. I hope I shall be <lb/> able to take care of myself.</p>
                <p>The tone in which this was said, had something in it of <lb/> upbraiding. Your
                    happiness, said I, is too dear to me to <lb/> leave it in danger. In this house
                    you will not need my <reg orig="pro-|tection">protection</reg>, <lb/> but I
                    shall never be so far from you, as to be <reg orig="disa-|bled">disabled</reg>
                    <lb/> from hearing how you fared, by letter, and of being <reg orig="ac-|tive"
                        >active</reg>
                    <lb/> for your good. You have some money which you <lb/> must husband well. Any
                    rent from your farm cannot be <lb/> soon expected; but what you have got, if you
                    remain with <lb/> Mr. Curling, will pay your board and all other expenses for
                    <lb/> two years; but you must be a good economist. I shall <reg orig="ex-|pect"
                        >expect</reg>, <lb/> continued I, with a serious smile, a punctual account
                    <lb/> of all your sayings and doings. I must know how every <lb/> minute is
                    employed, and every penny is expended, and if I <lb/> find you erring, I must
                    tell you so in good round terms.</p>
                <p>These words did not dissipate the sullenness which her <lb/> looks had betrayed.
                    She still forebore to look at me, and said <lb/> &mdash;I do not know how I
                    should tell you every thing. You <lb/> care so little about me that&mdash;I
                    should only be troublesome. <lb/> I am old enough to think and act for myself,
                    and shall advise <lb/> with nobody but myself.</p>
                <p>That is true, said I. I shall rejoice to see you <reg orig="indepen-|dent"
                        >independent</reg>
                    <lb/> and free. Consult your own understanding, and act <reg orig="ac-|cording"
                        >according</reg>
                    <lb/> to its dictates. Nothing more is wanting to make <lb/>
                    <pb n="72" entity="eaf033v2_0281" pid="uva-lib:349588"/> you useful and happy. I
                    am anxious to return to the city, <lb/> but, if you will allow me, will go first
                    to Malverton, see <lb/> that things are in due order, and that old Caleb is
                    well. <lb/> From thence, if you please, I will call at your uncle's, and <lb/>
                    tell him what has happened. He may, otherwise, <reg orig="enter-|tain"
                        >entertain</reg>
                    <lb/> pretensions and form views, erroneous in themselves <lb/> and injurious to
                    you. He may think himself entitled to <lb/> manage your estate. He may either
                    suppose a will to have <lb/> been made, or may actually have heard from your
                    father, <lb/> or from others, of that which you burnt, and in which he <lb/> was
                    named executor. His boisterous and sordid temper <lb/> may prompt him to seize
                    your house and goods, unless <lb/> seasonably apprized of the truth; and, when
                    he knows the <lb/> truth, he may start into rage, which I shall be more fitted
                    <lb/> to encounter than you. I am told that anger transforms <lb/> him into a
                    ferocious madman. Shall I call upon him?</p>
                <p>She shuddered at the picture which I had drawn of her <lb/> uncle's character;
                    but this emotion quickly gave place to <lb/> self-upbraiding, for the manner in
                    which she had repelled <lb/> my proffers of service. She melted once more into
                    tears, <lb/> and exclaimed:</p>
                <p>I am not worthy of the pains you take for me. I am <lb/> unfeeling and
                    ungrateful. Why should I think ill of you <lb/> for despising me, when I despise
                    myself?</p>
                <p>You do yourself injustice, my friend. I think I see your <lb/> most secret
                    thoughts; and these, instead of exciting anger <lb/> or contempt, only awaken
                    compassion and tenderness. <lb/> You love; and must, therefore, conceive my
                    conduct to be <lb/> perverse and cruel. I counted on your harboring such <lb/>
                    thoughts. Time only and reflection will enable you to see <lb/> my motives in
                    their true light. Hereafter you will recollect <lb/> my words, and find them
                    sufficient to justify my conduct. <lb/> You will acknowledge the propriety of my
                    engaging in the <lb/> cares of the world, before I sit down in retirement and
                    ease.</p>
                <p>Ah! how much you mistake me! I admire and approve <lb/> of your schemes. What
                    angers and distresses me is, that <lb/> you think me unworthy to partake of your
                    cares and labors; <lb/> that you regard my company as an obstacle and <reg
                        orig="incum-|brance">incumbrance</reg>; <lb/> that assistance and counsel
                    must all proceed from <lb/> you; and that no scene is fit for me, but what you

                <p>Have I not the same claims to be wise, and active, and <lb/> courageous as you?
                    If I am ignorant and weak, do I not <lb/> owe it to the same cause that has made
                    you so; and will <lb/> not the same means which promote your improvement be
                    <lb/> likewise useful to me? You desire to obtain knowledge, <lb/> by travelling
                    and conversing with many persons, and <reg orig="study-|ing">studying</reg>
                    <lb/> many sciences; but you desire it for yourself alone. <lb/> Me, you think
                    poor, weak, and contemptible; fit for nothing <lb/> but to spin and churn.
                    Provided I exist, am screened from <lb/> the weather, have enough to eat and
                    drink, you are <reg orig="satis-|fied">satisfied</reg>. <lb/> As to
                    strengthening my mind and enlarging my <reg orig="know-|ledge">knowledge</reg>,
                    <lb/> these things are valuable to you, but on me they are <lb/> thrown away. I
                    deserve not the gift.</p>
                <p>This strain, simple and just as it was, was wholly <reg orig="unex-|pected"
                        >unexpected</reg>. <lb/> I was surprised and disconcerted. In my previous
                    <lb/> reasonings I had certainly considered her sex as utterly <reg
                        orig="un-|fiting">unfiting</reg>
                    <lb/> her for those scenes and pursuits, to which I had <reg orig="des-|tined"
                        >destined</reg>
                    <lb/> myself. Not a doubt of the validity of my conclusion <lb/> had insinuated
                    itself; but now my belief was shaken, though <lb/> it was not subverted. I could
                    not deny, that human <reg orig="igno-|ance">ignoance</reg>
                    <lb/> was curable by the same means in one sex as in the <lb/> other; that
                    fortitude and skill was of no less value to one <lb/> than to the other.</p>
                <p>Questionless, my friend was rendered, by her age and <reg orig="in-|experience"
                        >inexperience</reg>, <lb/> if not by sex, more helpless and dependent than
                    <lb/> I; but had I not been prone to overrate the difficulties <lb/> which I
                    should encounter? Had I not deemed unjustly of <lb/> her constancy and force of
                    mind? Marriage would render <lb/> her property joint, and would not compel me to
                    take up my <lb/> abode in the woods, to abide forever in one spot, to shackle
                    <lb/> my curiosity, or limit my excursions.</p>
                <p>But marriage was a contract awful and irrevocable. Was <lb/> this the woman with
                    whom my reason enjoined me to blend <lb/> my fate, without the power of
                    dissolution? Would no <lb/> time unfold qualities in her which I did not at
                    present <reg orig="sus-|pect">suspect</reg>, <lb/> and which would evince an
                    incurable difference in our <lb/> minds? Would not time lead me to the feet of
                    one who <lb/> more nearly approached that standard of ideal excellence <lb/>
                    which poets and romancers had exhibited to my view?</p>
                <p>These considerations were powerful and delicate. I <lb/>
                    <pb n="74" entity="eaf033v2_0283" pid="uva-lib:349590"/> knew not in what terms
                    to state them to my companion, so <lb/> as to preclude the imputation of
                    arrogance or indecorum. <lb/> It became me, however, to be explicit, and to
                    excite her <lb/> resentment rather than mislead her judgment. She <reg
                        orig="col-|lected">collected</reg>
                    <lb/> my meaning from a few words, and, interrupting me, <lb/> said:</p>
                <p>How very low is the poor Eliza in your opinion! We are, <lb/> indeed, both too
                    young to be married. May I not see you, <lb/> and talk with you, without being
                    your wife? May I not <lb/> share your knowledge, relieve your cares, and enjoy
                    your <lb/> confidence, as a sister might do? May I not accompany <lb/> you in
                    your journeys and studies, as one friend <reg orig="accompa-|nies"
                        >accompanies</reg>
                    <lb/> another? My property may be yours; you may <reg orig="em-|ploy"
                        >employ</reg>
                    <lb/> it for your benefit and mine; not because you are my <lb/> husband, but my
                    friend. You are going to the city. Let <lb/> me go along with you. Let me live
                    where you live. The <lb/> house that is large enough to hold you, will hold me.
                    The <lb/> fare that is good enough for you will be luxury to me. Oh! <lb/> let
                    it be so, will you? You cannot think how studious, how <lb/> thoughtful, how
                    inquisitive I will be. How tenderly I will <lb/> nurse you when sick: it is
                    possible you may be sick, you <lb/> know, and no one in the world will be half
                    so watchful <lb/> and affectionate as I shall be. Will you let me?</p>
                <p>In saying this, her earnestness gave new pathos to her <lb/> voice. Insensibly
                    she put her face close to mine, and, <lb/> transported beyond the usual bounds
                    of reserve, by the <lb/> charms of that picture which her fancy contemplated,
                    she <lb/> put her lips to my cheek, and repeated, in a melting <reg
                        orig="ac-|cent">accent</reg>, <lb/> will you let me?</p>
                <p>You, my friends, who have not seen Eliza Hadwin, <reg orig="can-|not"
                        >cannot</reg>
                    <lb/> conceive what effect this entreaty was adapted to <reg orig="pro-|duce"
                        >produce</reg>
                    <lb/> in me. She has surely the sweetest voice, the most <lb/> speaking
                    features, and most delicate symmetry, that ever <lb/> woman possessed. Her
                    guileless simplicity and tenderness <lb/> made her more enchanting. To be the
                    object of devotion <lb/> to a heart so fervent and pure, was, surely, no common
                    <lb/> privilege. Thus did she tender me herself; and was not <lb/> the gift to
                    be received with eagerness and gratitude?</p>
                <p>No. I was not so much a stranger to mankind as to <reg orig="ac-|quiesce"
                        >acquiesce</reg>
                    <lb/> in this scheme. As my sister or my wife, the world <lb/> would suffer us
                    to reside under the same roof; to apply, to <lb/>
                    <pb n="75" entity="eaf033v2_0284" pid="uva-lib:349591"/> common use, the same
                    property; and daily to enjoy the <lb/> company of each other; but she was not my
                    sister, and <lb/> marriage would be an act of the grossest indiscretion. I <lb/>
                    explained to her, in few words, the objections to which her <lb/> project was
                    liable.</p>
                <p>Well, then, said she, let me live in the next house, in <lb/> the neighborhood,
                    or, at least, in the same city. Let me <lb/> be where I may see you once a day,
                    or once a week, or <lb/> once a month. Shut me not wholly from your society, and
                    <lb/> the means of becoming, in time, less ignorant and foolish <lb/> than I now
                    am.</p>
                <p>After a pause, I replied, I love you too well not to <reg orig="com-|ply"
                        >comply</reg>
                    <lb/> with this request. Perhaps the city will be as suitable <lb/> a residence
                    as any other for you, as it will, for some time, <lb/> be most convenient to me.
                    I shall be better able to watch <lb/> over your welfare, and supply you with the
                    means of <reg orig="im-|provement">improvement</reg>, <lb/> when you are within
                    a small distance. At <reg orig="pre-|sent">present</reg>, <lb/> you must consent
                    to remain here, while I visit your <lb/> uncle, and afterwards go to the city. I
                    shall look out for <lb/> you a suitable lodging, and inform you when it is
                    found. If <lb/> you then continue in the same mind, I will come, and, <reg

                    <lb/> gained the approbation of Mr. Curling, will conduct <lb/> you to town.

                <p><hi rend="small-caps">Though</hi> I had consented to this scheme, I was conscious
                    <lb/> that some hazards attended it. I was afraid of calumny, <lb/> which might
                    trouble the peace or destroy the reputation of <lb/> my friend. I was afraid of
                    my own weakness, which might <lb/> be seduced into an indiscrect marriage, by
                    the charms or <lb/> sufferings of this bewitching creature. I felt that there
                    <lb/> was no price too dear to save her from slander. A fair fame <lb/> is of
                    the highest importance to a young female, and the loss <lb/> of it but poorly
                    supplied by the testimony of her own <reg orig="con-|science">conscience</reg>.
                    <lb/> I had reason for tenfold solicitude on this account, <lb/> since I was her

                    <lb/> some hopes, that time might change her views, and <lb/>

                    schemes. Meanwhile, I was to lose <lb/> no time in visiting Malverton and Philip
                    Hadwin.</p>
                <p>About ten days had elasped since we had deserted <reg orig="Mal-|verton"

                    <lb/> had been rendered inconvenient. The weather was <lb/> now calm and clear,
                    and, early in the morning that ensued <lb/> the dialogue which I have just
                    related, I set out on <reg orig="horse-|back">horseback</reg>.</p>
                <p>Honest Caleb was found, eating his breakfast nearly in the <lb/> spot where he

                    days after our departure, <lb/> several men had come to the house, one of whom
                    was <lb/> Philip Hadwin. They had interrogated him as to the <reg
                        orig="con-|dition">condition</reg>
                    <lb/> of the farm, and the purpose of his remaining on it. <lb/> William Hadwin
                    they knew to have been sometime dead, <lb/> but where were the girls, his
                    daughters?</p>
                <p>Caleb answered that Susy, the eldest, was likewise dead.</p>
                <p>These tidings excited astonishment. When died she, <lb/> and how, and where was
                    she buried?</p>
                <p>It happened two days before, and she was buried, he <reg orig="be-|lieved"
                        >believed</reg>, <lb/> but could not tell where.</p>
                <p>Not tell where? By whom then was she buried?</p>
                <p>Really be could not tell. Some strange man came there <lb/> just as she was
                    dying. He went to the room, and when <lb/> she was dead, took her away, but what
                    he did with the <lb/> body, was more than he could say, but he had a notion
                    <lb/> that he buried it. The man stayed till the morning, and then <lb/> went
                    off with Lizzy, leaving him to keep house by <reg orig="him-|self"
                    >himself</reg>. <lb/> He had not seen either of them, nor indeed, a single <lb/>
                    soul since.</p>
                <p>This was all the information that Caleb could afford the <lb/> visitants. It was
                    so lame and incredible, that they began to <lb/> charge the man with falsehood,
                    and to threaten him with <lb/> legal animadversion. Just then, Mr. Ellis entered
                    the house, <lb/> and being made acquainted with the subject of discourse, <lb/>
                    told all that he himself knew. He related the midnight <lb/> visit which I had
                    paid him, explained my former situation <lb/> in the family, and my
                    disappearance in September. He <lb/> stated the advice he had given me to carry
                    Eliza to her <lb/> uncle's and my promise to comply with his counsel. The <lb/>
                    uncle declared he had seen nothing of his niece, and Caleb <lb/>
                    <pb n="77" entity="eaf033v2_0286" pid="uva-lib:349593"/> added, that when she
                    set out, she took the road that led <lb/> to town.</p>
                <p>These hints afforded grounds for much conjecture and <lb/> suspicion. Ellis now
                    mentioned some intelligence that he <lb/> had gathered respecting me in a late
                    journey to&mdash;. It <lb/> seems I was the son of an honest farmer in that
                    quarter, who <lb/> who married a tidy girl of a milk-maid, that lived with him.
                    <lb/> My father had detected me in making some atrocious <reg orig="ad-|vances"
                        >advances</reg>
                    <lb/> to my mother in law, and had turned me out of <lb/> doors. I did not go
                    off, however, without rifling his drawer <lb/> of some hundreds of dollars,
                    which he had laid up against <lb/> a rainy day. I was noted for such pranks, and
                    was hated <lb/> by all the neighbors for my pride and laziness. It was easy,
                    <lb/> by comparison of circumstances, for Ellis to ascertain that <lb/> Hadwin's
                    servant Mervyn, was the same against whom such <lb/> hearty charges were
                    laid.</p>
                <p>Previously to this journey, he had heard of me from <reg orig="Had-|win"
                        >Hadwin</reg>, <lb/> who was loud in praise of my diligence, sobriety and
                    <lb/> modesty. For his part, he had always been cautious of <lb/> giving
                    countenance to vagrants, that came from nobody <lb/> knew where, and worked
                    their way with a plausible tongue. <lb/> He was not surprised to hear it
                    whispered that Betsey <reg orig="Had-|win">Hadwin</reg>
                    <lb/> had fallen in love with the youth, and now, no doubt, <lb/> be had
                    persuaded her to run away with him. The heiress <lb/> of a fine farm was a prize
                    not to be met with every day.</p>
                <p>Philip broke into rage at this news; swore that if it turned <lb/> out so, his
                    niece should starve upon the town, and that he <lb/> would take good care to
                    baulk the lad. His brother he well <lb/> knew had left a will, to which he was
                    executor, and that this <lb/> will, would in good time, be forth coming. After
                    much <lb/> talk and ransacking the house, and swearing at his truant <lb/>
                    niece, he and his company departed, charging Caleb to <lb/> keep the house and
                    its contents for his use. This was all <lb/> that Caleb's memory had retained of
                    that day's proceedings.</p>
                <p>Curling had lately commented on the character of Philip <lb/> Hadwin. This man
                    was totally unlike his brother, was a <lb/> noted brawler and bully, a tyrant to
                    his children, a plague <lb/> to his neighbors, and kept a rendezvous for
                    drunkards and <lb/> idlers, at the sign of the Bull's Head, at &mdash;. He <lb/>
                    was not destitute of parts, and was no less dreaded for <reg orig="cun-|ning"
                        >cunning</reg>
                    <lb/> than malignity. He was covetous, and never missed <lb/>
                    <pb n="78" entity="eaf033v2_0287" pid="uva-lib:349594"/> an opportunity of
                    overreaching his neighbor. There was no <lb/> doubt that his niece's property
                    would be embezzled, should <lb/> it ever come into his hands, and any power
                    which he might <lb/> obtain over her person, would be exercised to her <reg
                        orig="destruc-|tion">destruction</reg>. <lb/> His children were tainted with
                    the dissoluteness of <lb/> their father, and marriage had not repaired the
                    reputation <lb/> of his daughters, or cured them of depravity; this was the
                    <lb/> man whom I now proposed to visit.</p>
                <p>I scarcely need to say that the calumny of Betty <reg orig="Law-|rence"
                        >Lawrence</reg>
                    <lb/> gave me no uneasiness. My father had no doubt <lb/> been deceived, as well
                    as my father's neighbors, by the <reg orig="ar-|tifices">artifices</reg>
                    <lb/> of this woman. I passed among them for a thief and <lb/> a profligate, but
                    their error had hitherto been harmless to <lb/> me. The time might come which
                    should confute the tale, <lb/> without my efforts. Betty, sooner or later, would
                    drop her <lb/> mask, and afford the antidote to her own poisons, unless <lb/>
                    some new incident should occur to make me hasten the <lb/> catastrophe.</p>
                <p>I arrived at Hadwin's house. I was received with some <lb/> attention as a guest.
                    I looked among the pimpled visages <lb/> that filled the piazza, for that of the
                    landlord, but found him <lb/> in an inner apartment with two or three more,
                    seated round <lb/> a table. On intimating my wish to speak with him alone, <lb/>
                    the others withdrew.</p>
                <p>Hadwin's visage had some traces of resemblance to his <lb/> brother; but the
                    meek, placid air, pale cheeks and slender <lb/> form of the latter, were
                    powerfully contrasted with the <lb/> bloated arrogance, imperious brow and
                    robust limbs of the <lb/> former. This man's rage was awakened by a straw; it
                    <lb/> impelled him in an instant to oaths and buffetings, and made <lb/> his
                    life an eternal brawl. The sooner my interview with <lb/> such a personage
                    should be at an end, the better. I <reg orig="there-|fore">therefore</reg>
                    <lb/> explained the purpose of my coming as fully and in as <lb/> few words as
                    possible.</p>
                <p>Your name, Sir, is Philip Hadwin. Your brother William, <lb/> of Malverton, died
                    lately and left two daughters. The <lb/> youngest only is now alive, and I come,
                    commissioned from <lb/> her, to inform you, that as no will of her father's is
                    extant, <lb/> she is preparing to administer to his estate. As her father's
                    <lb/> brother, she thought you entitled to this information.</p>
                <pb n="79" entity="eaf033v2_0288" pid="uva-lib:349595"/>
                <p>The change which took place in the countenance of this <lb/> man, during this
                    address, was remarkable, but not easily <lb/> described. His cheeks contracted a
                    deeper crimson, his <lb/> eyes sparkled, and his face assumed an expression in
                    which <lb/> curiosity was mingled with rage. He bent forwards and <lb/> said, in
                    a hoarse and contemptuous tone, pray, is your name <lb/> Mervyn?</p>
                <p>I answered, without hesitation, and as if the question were <lb/> wholly
                    unimportant, yes; my name is Mervyn.</p>
                <p>God damn it! You then are the damned rascal&mdash;(but <lb/> permit me to repeat
                    his speech without the oaths, with which <lb/> it was plentifully interlarded.
                    Not three words were uttered <lb/> without being garnished with a&mdash;God damn
                    it! damnation! <lb/> I'll be damned to hell if&mdash;and the like energetic
                    expletives.) <lb/> You then are the rascal that robbed Billy's house; that ran
                    <lb/> away with the fool his daughter; persuaded her to burn her <lb/> father's
                    will, and have the hellish impudence to come into <lb/> this house! But I thank
                    you for it. I was going to look <lb/> for you&mdash;you've saved me trouble.
                    I'll settle all accounts <lb/> with you here. Fair and softly, my good lad! If I
                    don't <lb/> bring you to the gallows&mdash;If I let you escape without such
                    <lb/> a dressing! Damned impudence! Fellow! I've been <lb/> at Malverton. I've
                    heard of your tricks; so! finding the <lb/> will not quite to your mind, knowing
                    that the executor would <lb/> baulk your schemes, you threw the will into the
                    fire; you <lb/> robbed the house of all the cash, and made off with the girl!
                    <lb/> &mdash;The old fellow saw it all, and will swear to the truth.</p>
                <p>These words created some surprise. I meant not to <lb/> conceal from this man the
                    tenor and destruction of the will, <lb/> nor even the measures which his niece
                    had taken or intended <lb/> to take. What I supposed to be unknown to him,
                    appeared <lb/> to have been communicated by the talkative Caleb, whose <lb/>
                    mind was more inquisitive and less sluggish than first <reg orig="ap-|pearances"
                        >appearances</reg>
                    <lb/> had led me to imagine. Instead of moping by <lb/> the kitchen fire, when
                    Eliza and I were conversing in an <lb/> upper room, it now appeared that he had
                    reconnoitred our <lb/> proceedings through some key hole or crevice, and had
                        <reg orig="re-|lated">related</reg>
                    <lb/> what he had seen to Hadwin.</p>
                <p>Hadwin proceeded to exhaust his rage in oaths and <reg orig="me-|naces"
                        >menaces</reg>. <lb/> He frequently clenched his fist, and thrust it in my
                    <lb/> face, drew it back as if to render his blow more deadly; <lb/>
                    <pb n="80" entity="eaf033v2_0289" pid="uva-lib:349596"/> ran over the same
                    series of exclamations on my impudence <lb/> and villany, and talked of the
                    gallows and the <reg orig="whipping-|post">whipping-post</reg>; <lb/> enforced
                    each word by the epithets&mdash;<hi rend="italic">damnable</hi> and <lb/>
                    <hi rend="italic">hellish</hi>&mdash;closed each sentence with&mdash;and be
                    curst to you!</p>
                <p>There was but one mode for me to pursue; all forcible <lb/> opposition to a man
                    of his strength was absurd. It was my <lb/> province to make his anger confine
                    itself to words, and <reg orig="pa-|tiently">patiently</reg>
                    <lb/> to wait till the paroxysm should end or subside of <lb/> itself. To effect
                    this purpose, I kept my seat, and <reg orig="care-|fully">carefully</reg>
                    <lb/> excluded from my countenance every indication of <lb/> timidity and panic
                    on the one hand, and of scorn and defiance <lb/> on the other. My look and
                    attitude were those of a man <lb/> who expected harsh words, but who entertained
                    no <reg orig="suspi-|cion">suspicion</reg>
                    <lb/> that blows would be inflicted.</p>
                <p>I was indebted for my safety to an inflexible adherence to <lb/> this medium. To
                    have strayed, for a moment, to either <lb/> side, would have brought upon me his
                    blows. That he did <lb/> not instantly resort to violence, inspired me with
                    courage, <lb/> since it depended on myself whether food should be supplied <lb/>
                    to his passion. Rage must either progress or decline, and <lb/> since it was in
                    total want of provocation, it could not fail of <lb/> gradually subsiding.</p>
                <p>My demeanor was calculated to damp the flame, not only <lb/> by its direct
                    influence, but by diverting his attention from the <lb/> wrongs which he had
                    received, to the novelty of my <reg orig="be-|havior">behavior</reg>. <lb/> The
                    disparity in size and strength between us, was <lb/> too evident to make him
                    believe that I confided in my sinews <lb/> for my defence; and since I betrayed
                    neither contempt nor <lb/> fear, he could not but conclude that I trusted to my
                    own <reg orig="in-|tegrity">integrity</reg>
                    <lb/> or to his moderation. I seized the first pause in his <lb/> rhetoric to
                    enforce this sentiment.</p>
                <p>You are angry, Mr. Hadwin, and are loud in your threats, <lb/> but they do not
                    frighten me. They excite no apprehension <lb/> or alarm, because I know myself
                    able to convince you that <lb/> I have not injured you. This is an inn, and I am
                    your <lb/> guest. I am sure I shall find better entertainment than <lb/> blows.
                    Come, continued I, smiling, it is possible that I <lb/> am not so mischievous a
                    wretch as your fancy paints me. <lb/> I have no claims upon your niece but that
                    of friendship, and <lb/> she is now in the house of an honest man, Mr. Curling,
                    <lb/> where she proposes to continue as long as is convenient.</p>

                <p>It is true that your brother left a will, which his daughter <lb/> burnt in my
                    presence, because she dreaded the authority <lb/> which that will gave you, not

                    <lb/> you. I intended to give you this news, and a drubbing <lb/> into the
                    bargain; but you may go, and make haste. She <lb/> burnt the will, did she;
                    because I was named in it&mdash;and <lb/> sent you to tell me so? Good souls! It
                    was kind of you, <lb/> and I am bound to be thankful. Take her back news of
                    <lb/> the mortgage; and, as for you, leave my house. You may <lb/> go scot free
                    this time; but I pledge my word for a sound <lb/> beating when you next enter
                    these doors. I'll pay it you <lb/> with interest. Leave my house, I say!</p>
                <p>A mortgage, said I, in a low voice, and affecting not to <lb/> hear his commands,
                    that will be sad news for my friend. <lb/> Why, sir, you are a fortunate man.
                    Malverton is an <reg orig="ex-|cellent">excellent</reg>
                    <lb/> spot; well watered and manured; newly and <reg orig="com-|pletely"
                        >completely</reg>
                    <lb/> fenced; not a larger barn in the county; oxen <lb/> and horses, and cows
                    in the best order; I never sat <lb/> eyes on a finer orchard. By my faith, sir,
                    you are a <lb/> fortunate man. But, pray, what have you for dinner? I <lb/>
                    <pb n="82" entity="eaf033v2_0291" pid="uva-lib:349598"/> am hungry as a wolf.
                    Order me a beef-steak, and some <lb/> potation or other. The bottle
                    there&mdash;it is cider, I take it; <lb/> pray, push it to this side. Saying
                    this, I stretched out my <lb/> hand towards the bottle which stood before
                    him.</p>
                <p>I confided in the power of a fearless and sedate manner. <lb/> Methought that as
                    anger was the food of anger, it must <reg orig="un-|avoidably">unavoidably</reg>
                    <lb/> subside in a contest with equability. This opinion <lb/> was intuitive,
                    rather than the product of experience, and <lb/> perhaps, I gave no proof of my
                    sagacity in hazarding my <lb/> safety on its truth. Hadwin's character made him
                    dreaded <lb/> and obeyed by all. He had been accustomed to ready <lb/> and
                    tremulous submission from men far more brawny and <lb/> robust than I was, and
                    to find his most vehement menaces <lb/> and gestures, totally ineffectual on a
                    being so slender and <reg orig="di-|minutive">diminutive</reg>, <lb/> at once
                    wound up his rage and excited his <reg orig="as-|tonishment">astonishment</reg>.
                    <lb/> One motion counteracted and suspended the <lb/> other. He lifted his hand,
                    but delayed to strike. One <lb/> blow, applied with his usual dexterity, was
                    sufficient to <lb/> destroy me. Though seemingly careless, I was watchful of
                    <lb/> his motions, and prepared to elude the stroke by shrinking <lb/> or
                    stooping. Meanwhile, I stretched my hand far enough <lb/> to seize the bottle,
                    and pouring its contents into a tumbler, <lb/> put it to my lips.</p>
                <p>Come, sir, I drink your health, and wish you speedy <lb/> possession of
                    Malverton. I have some interest with Eliza, <lb/> and will prevail on her to
                    forbear all opposition and <reg orig="com-|plaint">complaint</reg>. <lb/> Why
                    should she complain? While I live, she shall <lb/> not be a beggar. No doubt,
                    your claim is legal, and <reg orig="there-|fore">therefore</reg>
                    <lb/> ought to be admitted. What the law gave, the law has <lb/> taken away.
                    Blessed be the dispensers of law&mdash;excellent <lb/> cider! open another
                    bottle, will you, and I beseech hasten <lb/> dinner, if you would not see me
                    devour the table.</p>
                <p>It was just, perhaps, to conjure up the demon avarice <lb/> to fight with the
                    demon anger. Reason alone, would, in <lb/> such a contest, be powerless, but, in
                    truth, I spoke <reg orig="with-|out">without</reg>
                    <lb/> artifice or disguise. If his claim were legal, opposition <lb/> would be
                    absurd and pernicious. I meant not to rely upon <lb/> his own assertions, and
                    would not acknowledge the validity <lb/> of his claim, till I had inspected the
                    deed. Having <reg orig="in-|stituted">instituted</reg>
                    <lb/> suits, this was now in a public office, and there the <lb/> inspection
                    should be made. Meanwhile, no reason could be <lb/>
                    <pb n="83" entity="eaf033v2_0292" pid="uva-lib:349599"/> urged why I should part
                    from him in anger, while his <reg orig="kin-|dred">kindred</reg>
                    <lb/> to Eliza, and his title to her property, made it useful <lb/> to secure
                    his favor. It was possible to obtain a remission of <lb/> his claims, even when
                    the law enforced them; it would be <lb/> imprudent at least to diminish the
                    chances of remission by <lb/> fostering his wrath and provoking his enmity.</p>
                <p>What, he exclaimed, in a transport of fury, a'n't I <reg orig="mas-|ter"
                        >master</reg>
                    <lb/> of my own house? Out, I say!</p>
                <p>These were harsh terms, but they were not accompanied <lb/> by gestures and tones
                    so menacing as those which had <reg orig="be-|fore">before</reg>
                    <lb/> been used. It was plain that the tide, which so lately <lb/> threatened my
                    destruction, had begun to recede. This <lb/> encouraged me to persist.</p>
                <p>Be not alarmed, my good friend, said I, placidly and <lb/> smiling. A man of your
                    bone need not fear a pigmy like <lb/> me. I shall scarcely be able to dethrone
                    you in your own <lb/> castle, with an army of hostlers, tapsters, and cooks at
                    <lb/> your beck. You shall still be master here, provided you <lb/> use your
                    influence to procure me a dinner.</p>
                <p>His acquiescence in a pacific system, was extremely <reg orig="re-|luctant"
                        >reluctant</reg>
                    <lb/> and gradual. He laid aside one sullen tone and <lb/> wrathful look after
                    the other; and, at length, consented not <lb/> only to supply me with a dinner,
                    but to partake of it with <lb/> me. Nothing was more a topic of surprise to
                    himself, than <lb/> his forbearance. He knew not how it was. He had never <lb/>
                    been treated so before. He was not proof against entreaty <lb/> and submission;
                    but I had neither supplicated nor submitted. <lb/> The stuff that I was made of
                    was at once damnably tough <lb/> and devilishly pliant. When he thought of my
                    impudence, <lb/> in staying in his house after he had bade me leave it, he was
                    <lb/> tempted to resume his passion. When he reflected on my <lb/> courage, in
                    making light of his anger, notwithstanding his <lb/> known impetuosity and my
                    personal inferiority, he could not <lb/> withhold his esteem. But my patience
                    under his rebukes, <lb/> my unalterable equanimity, and my ready consent to the
                    <lb/> validity of his claims, soothed and propitiated him.</p>
                <p>An exemption from blows and abuse was all that I <lb/> could gain from this man.
                    I told him the truth, with <reg orig="re-|gard">regard</reg>
                    <lb/> to my own history, so far as it was connected with the <lb/> Hadwins. I
                    exhibited, in affecting colors, the helpless <reg orig="con-|dition"
                        >condition</reg>
                    <lb/> of Eliza; but could extort from him nothing but his <lb/>
                    <pb n="84" entity="eaf033v2_0293" pid="uva-lib:349600"/> consent, that, if she
                    chose, she might come and live with <lb/> him. He would give her victuals and
                    clothes for so much <lb/> house-work as she was able to do. If she chose to live
                    <lb/> elsewhere, he promised not to molest her, or intermeddle in <lb/> her
                    concerns. The house and land were his by law, and <lb/> he would have them.</p>
                <p>It was not my province to revile or expostulate with him. <lb/> I stated what
                    measures would be adopted by a man who <lb/> regarded the interest of others
                    more than his own; who was <lb/> anxious for the welfare of an innocent girl,
                    connected with <lb/> him so closely by the ties of kindred, and who was
                    destitute <lb/> of what is called natural friends. If he did not cancel, for
                    <lb/> her sake, his bond and mortgage, he would, at least, afford <lb/> her a
                    frugal maintenance. He would extend to her, in all <lb/> emergencies his counsel
                    and protection.</p>
                <p>All that, he said, was sheer nonsense. He could not <reg orig="suf-|ficiently"
                        >sufficiently</reg>
                    <lb/> wonder at my folly, in proposing to him to make a <lb/> free gift of a
                    hundred rich acres, to a girl too who scarcely <lb/> knew her right hand from
                    her left; whom the first cunning <lb/> young rogue, like myself, would <hi
                        rend="italic">chouse</hi> out of the whole, <lb/> and take herself into the
                    bargain. But my folly was even <lb/> surpassed by my impudence, since, as the
                        <hi rend="italic">friend</hi> of this <lb/> girl, I was merely petitioning
                    on my own account. I had <lb/> come to him, whom I never saw before, on whom I
                    had <lb/> no claim, and who, as I well knew, had reason to think me <lb/> a
                    sharper, and modestly said&mdash;"Here's a girl who has no <lb/> fortune. I am
                    greatly in want of one. Pray, give her <lb/> such an estate that you have in
                    your possession. If you <lb/> do, I'll marry her, and take it into my own
                    hands." I might <lb/> be thankful that he did not answer such a petition with
                    <lb/> a horse-whipping. But if he did not give her his estate, <lb/> he might
                    extend to her, forsooth, his counsel and <reg orig="protec-|tion"
                        >protection</reg>. <lb/> That I've offered to do, continued he. She may
                    <lb/> come and live in my house, if she will. She may do some <lb/> of the
                    family work. I'll discharge the chamber-maid to <lb/> make room for her. Lizzy,
                    if I remember right, has a <lb/> pretty face. She can't have a better market for
                    it than as <lb/> chamber-maid to an inn. If she minds her p's and q's she <lb/>
                    may make up a handsome sum at the year's end.</p>
                <p>I thought it time to break off the conference; and, my <lb/> dinner being
                    finished, took my leave; leaving behind me <lb/>

                    </pb> the character of <hi rend="italic">a queer sort of chap.</hi> I speeded to
                    the <lb/> prothonotary's office, which was kept in the village, and <lb/>
                    quickly ascertained the truth of Hadwin's pretensions. <lb/> There existed a
                    mortgage, with bond and warrant of <reg orig="attor-|ney">attorney</reg>, <lb/>
                    to so great an amount as would swallow up every thing <lb/> at Malverton.
                    Furnished with these tidings, I prepared, <lb/> with a drooping heart, to return
                    to Mr. Curling's.</p>

                <head>CHAPTER XXXIV.</head>
                <p><hi rend="small-caps">This</hi> incident necessarily produced a change in my
                    views <lb/> with regard to my friend. Her fortune consisted of a few <lb/>
                    hundreds of dollars, which, frugally administered, might <reg orig="pro-|cure"
                        >procure</reg>
                    <lb/> decent accommodation in the country. When this <lb/> was consumed, she
                    must find subsistence in tending the big <lb/> wheel or the milk pail, unless
                    fortune should enable me to <lb/> place her in a more favorable situation. This
                    state was, <lb/> in some respects, but little different from that in which she
                    <lb/> had spent the former part of her life; but, in her father's <lb/> house,
                    these employments were dignified by being, in some <lb/> degree, voluntary, and
                    relieved by frequent intervals of <reg orig="re-|creation">recreation</reg>
                    <lb/> and leisure. Now they were likely to prove <reg orig="irk-|some"
                        >irksome</reg>
                    <lb/> and servile, in consequence of being performed for <lb/> hire, and imposed
                    by necessity. Equality, parental <reg orig="solici-|tudes">solicitudes</reg>,
                    <lb/> and sisterly endearments would be wanting to lighten <lb/> the yoke.</p>
                <p>These inconveniences, however, were imaginary. This <lb/> was the school in which
                    fortitude and independence were <lb/> to be learned. Habit, and the purity of
                    rural manners, <lb/> would, likewise, create anew those ties which death had
                    <lb/> dissolved. The affections of parent and sister would be <lb/> supplied by
                    the fonder and more rational attachments of <lb/> friendship. These toils were
                    not detrimental to beauty or <lb/> health. What was to be dreaded from them,
                    was, their <lb/> tendency to quench the spirit of liberal curiosity; to <reg
                        orig="habit-|uate">habituate</reg>
                    <lb/> the person to bodily, rather than intellectual, exertions; <lb/> to
                    supersede, and create indifference or aversion to the <lb/>
                    <pb n="86" entity="eaf033v2_0295" pid="uva-lib:349602"/> only instruments of
                    rational improvement, the pen and the <lb/> book.</p>
                <p>This evil, however, was at some distance from Eliza. <lb/> Her present abode was
                    quiet and serene. Here she might <lb/> enjoy domestic pleasures and
                    opportunities of mental <reg orig="im-|provement">improvement</reg>
                    <lb/> for the coming twelvemonth at least. This <reg orig="peri-|od"
                        >period</reg>
                    <lb/> would, perhaps, be sufficient for the formation of <reg orig="studi-|ous"
                        >studious</reg>
                    <lb/> habits. What schemes should be adopted, for this end, <lb/> would be
                    determined by the destiny to which I myself should <lb/> be reserved.</p>
                <p>My path was already chalked out, and my fancy now <lb/> pursued it with uncommon
                    pleasure. To reside in your <lb/> family; to study your profession; to pursue
                    some <reg orig="subordi-|nate">subordinate</reg>
                    <lb/> or casual mode of industry, by which I might purchase <lb/> leisure for
                    medical pursuits, for social recreations, and for <lb/> the study of mankind, on
                    your busy and thronged stage, <lb/> was the scope of my wishes. This destiny
                    would not <reg orig="hin-|der">hinder</reg>
                    <lb/> punctual correspondence and occasional visits to Eliza. <lb/> Her pen
                    might be called into action, and her mind be <lb/> awakened by books, and every
                    hour be made to add to her <lb/> stores of knowledge and enlarge the bounds of
                    her <reg orig="capa-|city">capacity</reg>.</p>
                <p>I was spiritless and gloomy when I left &mdash;, but <reg orig="re-|flections"
                        >reflections</reg>
                    <lb/> on my future lot, and just views of the situation of <lb/> my friend,
                    insensibly restored my cheerfulness. I arrived <lb/> at Mr. Curling's in the
                    evening, and hastened to impart to <lb/> Eliza the issue of my commission. It
                    gave her uneasiness, <lb/> merely as it frustrated the design, on which she had
                        <reg orig="fond-|ly">fondly</reg>
                    <lb/> mused, of residing in the city. She was somewhat <reg orig="con-|soled"

                    <lb/> by my promises of being her constant correspondent <lb/> and occasional
                    visitor.</p>
                <p>Next morning I set out on my journey hither, on foot. <lb/> The way was not long;
                    the weather, though cold, was <lb/> wholesome and serene. My spirits were high,
                    and I saw <lb/> nothing in the world before me but sunshine and prosperity.
                    <lb/> I was conscious that my happiness depended not on the <lb/> revolutions of
                    nature or the caprice of man. All without <lb/> was, indeed, vicissitude and
                    uncertainty; but within my <reg orig="bo-|som">bosom</reg>
                    <lb/> was a centre not to be shaken or removed. My <reg orig="pur-|poses"
                        >purposes</reg>
                    <lb/> were honest and steadfast. Every sense was the inlet <lb/> of pleasure,
                    because it was the avenue to knowledge; and <lb/>
                    <pb n="87" entity="eaf033v2_0296" pid="uva-lib:349603"/> my soul brooded over
                    the world of ideas, and glowed <lb/> with exultation at the grandeur and beauty
                    of its own <reg orig="cre-|ations">creations</reg>.</p>
                <p>This felicity was too rapturous to be of long duration. I <lb/> gradually
                    descended from these heights; and the <reg orig="remem-|brance"
                        >remembrance</reg>
                    <lb/> of past incidents, connected with the images of your <lb/> family, to
                    which I was returning, led my thoughts into a <reg orig="dif-|ferent"
                        >different</reg>
                    <lb/> channel. Welbeck and the unhappy girl whom he <lb/> had betrayed; Mrs.
                    Villars and Wallace were recollected <lb/> anew. The views which I had formed,
                    for determining the <lb/> fate and affording assistance to Clemenza, were
                    recalled. <lb/> My former resolutions, with regard to her, had been <reg
                        orig="sus-|pended">suspended</reg>
                    <lb/> by the uncertainty in which the fate of the Hadwins <lb/> was, at that
                    time, wrapped. Had it not become necessary <lb/> wholly to lay aside these
                    resolutions?</p>
                <p>That, indeed, was an irksome conclusion. No wonder <lb/> that I struggled to
                    repel it; that I fostered the doubt whether <lb/> money was the only instrument
                    of benefit; whether caution, <lb/> and fortitude, and knowledge were not the
                    genuine <reg orig="preserv-|atives">preservatives</reg>
                    <lb/> from evil. Had I not the means in my hands of <reg orig="dis-|pelling"
                        >dispelling</reg>
                    <lb/> her fatal ignorance of Welbeck and of those with <lb/> whom she resided?
                    Was I not authorized by my previous, <lb/> though slender intercourse, to seek
                    her presence?</p>
                <p>Suppose I should enter Mrs. Villar's house, desire to be <lb/> introduced to the
                    lady, accost her with affectionate <reg orig="simplici-|ty">simplicity</reg>,
                    <lb/> and tell her the truth? Why be anxious to smooth the <lb/> way? why deal
                    in apologies, circuities and inuendoes? All <lb/> these are feeble and perverse
                    refinements, unworthy of an <lb/> honest purpose and an erect spirit. To believe
                    her <reg orig="inac-|cessible">inaccessible</reg>
                    <lb/> to my visit, was absurd. To wait for the <reg orig="permis-|sion"
                        >permission</reg>
                    <lb/> of those whose interest it might be to shut out visitants, <lb/> was
                    cowardice. This was an infringement of her liberty, <lb/> which equity and law
                    equally condemned. By what right <lb/> could she be restrained from intercourse
                    with others? <lb/> Doors and passages may be between her and me. With a <lb/>
                    purpose such as mine, no one had a right to close the one <lb/> or obstruct the
                    other. Away with cowardly reluctances and <lb/> clownish scruples, and let me
                    hasten this moment to her <lb/> dwelling.</p>
                <p>Mrs. Villars is the portress of the mansion. She will <lb/> probably present
                    herself before me, and demand the reason <lb/>
                    <pb n="88" entity="eaf033v2_0297" pid="uva-lib:349604"/> of my visit. What shall
                    I say to her? The truth. To <lb/> faulter, or equivocate, or dissemble to this
                    woman, would <lb/> be wicked. Perhaps her character has been <reg
                        orig="misunder-|stood">misunderstood</reg>
                    <lb/> and maligned. Can I render her a greater service <lb/> than to apprize her
                    of the aspersions that have rested on it, <lb/> and afford her the opportunity
                    of vindication? Perhaps <lb/> she is indeed selfish and profligate; the betrayer
                    of youth <lb/> and the agent of lasciviousness. Does she not deserve to <lb/>
                    know the extent of her errors and the ignominy of her trade? <lb/> Does she not
                    merit the compassion of the good and the <reg orig="re-|bukes">rebukes</reg>
                    <lb/> of the wise? To shrink from the task, would prove <lb/> me cowardly and
                    unfirm. Thus far, at least, let my courage <lb/> extend.</p>
                <p>Alas! Clemenza is unacquainted with my language. <lb/> My thoughts cannot make
                    themselves apparent but by <lb/> words, and to my words she will be able to
                    affix no <reg orig="mean-|ing">meaning</reg>. <lb/> Yet is not that a hasty
                    decision? The version from <lb/> the dramas of Zeno which I found in her toilet,
                    was <reg orig="pro-|bably">probably</reg>
                    <lb/> hers, and proves her to have a speculative knowledge <lb/> of our tongue.
                    Near half a year has since elasped, during <lb/> which she has dwelt with
                    talkers of English, and <reg orig="conse-|quently">consequently</reg>
                    <lb/> could not fail to have acquired it. This <reg orig="conclu-|sion"
                        >conclusion</reg>
                    <lb/> is somewhat dubious, but experiment will give it <reg orig="cer-|tainty"
                        >certainty</reg>.</p>
                <p>Hitherto I had strolled along the path at a lingering pace. <lb/> Time enough,
                    methought, to reach your threshold between <lb/> sunrise and moonlight, if my
                    way had been three times <lb/> longer than it was. You were the pleasing phantom
                    that <lb/> hovered before me, and beckoned me forward. What a <lb/> total
                    revolution had occurred in the course of a few seconds, <lb/> for thus long did
                    my reasonings with regard to Clemenza <lb/> and the Villars require to pass
                    through my understanding, <lb/> and escape, in half muttered soliloquy, from my
                    lips. My <lb/> muscles trembled with eagerness, and I bounded forward with <lb/>
                    impetuosity. I saw nothing but a visto of catalpas, leafless, <lb/> loaded with
                    icicles, and terminating in four chimneys and a <lb/> painted roof. My fancy
                    outstripped my footsteps, and was <lb/> busy in picturing faces and rehearsing
                    dialogues. Presently <lb/> I reached this new object of my pursuit, darted
                    through the <lb/> avenue, noticed that some windows of the house were <reg
                        orig="un-|closed">unclosed</reg>, <lb/> drew thence a hasty inference that
                    the house was <lb/>
                    <pb n="89" entity="eaf033v2_0298" pid="uva-lib:349605"/> not without
                    inhabitants, and knocked, quickly and loudly, <lb/> for admission.</p>
                <p>Some one within crept to the door, opened it with <reg orig="seem-|ing"
                        >seeming</reg>
                    <lb/> caution, and just far enough to allow the face to be seen. <lb/> It was
                    the timid, pale and unwashed face of a girl who was <lb/> readily supposed to be
                    a servant, taken from a cottage, and <lb/> turned into a bringer of wood and
                    water, and a scourer of <lb/> tubs and trenches. She waited in timorous silence
                    the <reg orig="de-|livery">delivery</reg>
                    <lb/> of my message. Was Mrs. Villars at home?</p>
                <p>No; she has gone to town.</p>
                <p>Were any of her daughters within?</p>
                <p>She could not tell; she believed&mdash;she thought&mdash;which <lb/> did I want?
                    Miss Hetty or Miss Sally?</p>
                <p>Let me see Miss Hetty. Saying this, I pushed gently <lb/> against the door. The
                    girl, half reluctant, yielded way; <lb/> I entered the passage, and putting my
                    hand on the lock of a <lb/> door that seemed to lead into a parlor&mdash;is Miss
                    Hetty in <lb/> this room?</p>
                <p>No; there was nobody there.</p>
                <p>Go call her then. Tell her there is one who wishes <lb/> to see her on important
                    business. I will wait for her <lb/> coming in this room. So saying, I opened the
                    door, and <lb/> entered the apartment, while the girl withdrew to perform <lb/>
                    my message.</p>
                <p>The parlor was spacious and expensively furnished, but <lb/> an air of negligence
                    and disorder was every where visible. <lb/> The carpet was wrinkled and unswept;
                    a clock on the table, <lb/> in a glass frame, so streaked and spotted with dust
                    as scarcely <lb/> to be transparent, and the index motionless, and pointing at
                    <lb/> four instead of nine; embers scattered on the marble hearth, <lb/> and
                    tougs lying on the fender with the handle in the ashes; <lb/> a harpsicord,
                    uncovered, one end loaded with <hi rend="italic">scores,</hi>
                    <reg orig="tum-|bled">tumbled</reg>
                    <lb/> together in a heap, and the other with volumes of <lb/> novels and plays,
                    some on their edges, some on their backs, <lb/> gaping open by the scorching of
                    their covers; rent; blurred; <lb/> stained; blotted; dog-eared; tables awry;
                    chairs crowding <lb/> each other; in short, no object but indicated the neglect
                    or <lb/> ignorance of domestic neatness and economy.</p>
                <p>My leisure was employed in surveying these objects, and <lb/> in listening for
                    the approach of Miss Hetty. Some <reg orig="min-|utes">minutes</reg>
                    <lb/> clasped, and no one came. A reason for delay was <lb/>
                    <pb n="90" entity="eaf033v2_0299" pid="uva-lib:349606"/> easily imagined, and I
                    summoned patience to wait. I <reg orig="open-|ed">opened</reg>
                    <lb/> a book; touched the instrument; surveyed the vases <lb/> on the
                    mantel-tree; the figures on the hangings, and the <lb/> print of Apollo and the
                    Sybil, taken from Salvator, and <lb/> hung over the chimney. I eyed my own shape
                    and garb <lb/> in the mirror, and asked how my rustic appearance would <lb/> be
                    regarded by that supercilious and voluptuous being, to <lb/> whom I was about to
                    present myself.</p>
                <p>Presently the latch of the door was softly moved, it <reg orig="open-|ed"
                        >opened</reg>, <lb/> and the simpleton, before described, appeared. She
                    <lb/> spoke, but her voice was so full of hesitation, and so near <lb/> a
                    whisper, that much attention was needed to make out her <lb/> words; Miss Hetty
                    was not at home&mdash;she was gone to <lb/> town with her <hi rend="italic"
                        >mistress.</hi></p>
                <p>This was a tale not to be credited. How was I to act? <lb/> She persisted in
                    maintaining the truth of it.&mdash;Well, then, <lb/> said I, at length, tell
                    Miss Sally that I wish to speak with <lb/> her. She will answer my purpose just
                    as well.</p>
                <p>Miss Sally was not at home neither. She had gone to <lb/> town too. They would
                    not be back, she did not know <lb/> when; not till night, she supposed. It was
                    so indeed, none <lb/> of them wasn't at home; none but she and Nanny in the
                    <lb/> kitchen&mdash;indeed there wasn't.</p>
                <p>Go tell Nanny to come here&mdash;I will leave my message <lb/> with her. She
                    withdrew, but Nanny did not receive the <lb/> summons, or thought proper not to
                    obey it. All was vacant <lb/> and still.</p>
                <p>My state was singular and critical. It was absurd to <lb/> prolong it; but to
                    leave the house with my errand <reg orig="unex-|ecuted">unexecuted</reg>, <lb/>
                    would argue imbecility and folly. To ascertain <lb/> Clemenza's presence in this
                    house, and to gain an interview, <lb/> were yet in my power. Had I not boasted
                    of my intrepidity <lb/> in braving denials and commands, when they endeavored to
                    <lb/> obstruct my passage to this woman? But here were no <reg
                        orig="ob-|stacles">obstacles</reg>
                    <lb/> nor prohibition. Suppose the girl had said truth, <lb/> that the matron
                    and her daughters were absent, and that <lb/> Nanny and herself were the only
                    guardians of the mansion. <lb/> So much the better. My design will not be
                    opposed. I <lb/> have only to mount the stair, and go from one room to <reg
                        orig="an-|other">another</reg>, <lb/> till I find what I seek.</p>
                <p>There was hazard, as well as plausibility, in this scheme, <lb/>
                    <pb n="91" entity="eaf033v2_0300" pid="uva-lib:349607"/> I thought it best once
                    more to endeavor to extort <reg orig="inform-|ation">information</reg>
                    <lb/> from the girl, and persuade her to be my guide to <lb/> whomsoever the
                    house contained. I put my hand to the <lb/> bell and rung a brisk peal. No one
                    came. I passed into <lb/> the entry, to the foot of a staircase, and to a back
                    window. <lb/> Nobody was within hearing or sight.</p>
                <p>Once more I reflected on the rectitude of my intentions, <lb/> on the possibility
                    that the girl's assertions might be true, <lb/> on the benefits of expedition,
                    and of gaining access to the <lb/> object of my visit without interruption or
                    delay. To these <lb/> considerations was added a sort of charm, not easily <reg
                        orig="ex-|plained">explained</reg>, <lb/> and by no means justifiable,
                    produced by the very <lb/> temerity and hazardness accompanying this attempt. I
                    <lb/> thought, with scornful emotions, on the bars and hindrances, <lb/> which
                    pride, and caprice, and delusive maxims of decorum, <lb/> raise in the way of
                    human intercourse. I spurned at these <lb/> semblances and substitutes of
                    honesty, and delighted to shake <lb/> such fetters into air, and trample such
                    impediments to dust. <lb/> I wanted to see a human being, in order to promote
                    her <lb/> happiness. It was doubtful whether she was within twenty <lb/> paces
                    of the spot where I stood. The doubt was to be <lb/> solved. How? By examining
                    the space. I forthwith <reg orig="pro-|ceeded">proceeded</reg>
                    <lb/> to examine it. I reached the second story. I <reg orig="ap-|proached"
                        >approached</reg>
                    <lb/> a door that was closed. I knocked; after a <lb/> pause, a soft voice said,
                    who is there?</p>
                <p>The accents were as musical as those of Clemenza, but <lb/> were in other
                    respects, different. I had no topic to discuss <lb/> with this person. I
                    answered not, yet hesitated to withdraw. <lb/> Presently the same voice was
                    again heard; what is it you <lb/> want? Why don't you answer? Come in!&mdash;I
                    complied <lb/> with the command, and entered the room.</p>
                <p>It was deliberation and foresight that led me hither, and <lb/> not chance or
                    caprice. Hence, instead of being <reg orig="disconcert-|ed">disconcerted</reg>
                    <lb/> or vanquished by the objects that I saw, I was tranquil <lb/> and firm. My
                    curiosity, however, made me a vigilant <reg orig="ob-|server">observer</reg>.
                    <lb/> Two females, arrayed with voluptuous negligence, <lb/> in a manner adapted
                    to the utmost seclusion, and seated in <lb/> a careless attitude, on a soft,
                    were now discovered.</p>
                <p>Both darted glances at the door. One, who appeared <lb/> to be the youngest, no
                    sooner saw me, than she shrieked, <lb/> and starting from her seat, betrayed in
                    the looks which she <lb/>
                    <pb n="92" entity="eaf033v2_0301" pid="uva-lib:349608"/> successively cast upon
                    me, on herself and on the chamber, <lb/> whose apparatus was in no less
                    confusion than that of the <lb/> apartment below, her consciousness of the
                    unseasonableness <lb/> of this meeting.</p>
                <p>The other shrieked likewise, but on her it seemed to be <lb/> the token of
                    surprise, rather than that of terror. There <lb/> was, probably, somewhat in my
                    aspect and garb that <reg orig="sug-|gested">suggested</reg>
                    <lb/> an apology for this intrusion, as arising from simplicity <lb/> and
                    mistake. She thought proper, however, to assume the <lb/> air of one offended,
                    and looking sternly&mdash;How now, fellow, <lb/> said she, what is this? Why
                    come you hither?</p>
                <p>This questioner was of mature age, but had not passed <lb/> the period of
                    attractiveness and grace. All the beauty that <lb/> nature had bestowed was
                    still retained, but the portion had <lb/> never been great. What she possessed
                    was so modelled <lb/> and embellished by such a carriage and dress, as to give
                    it <lb/> most power over the senses of the gazer. In proportion, <lb/> however,
                    as it was intended and adapted to captivate those, <lb/> who know none but
                    physical pleasures, it was qualified to <lb/> breed distaste and aversion in
                    me.</p>
                <p>I am sensible how much error may have lurked in this <lb/> descision. I had
                    brought with me the belief of their being <lb/> unchaste; and seized, perhaps
                    with too much avidity, any <lb/> appearance that coincided with my
                    prepossessions. Yet the <lb/> younger by no means inspired the same disgust;
                    though I <lb/> had no reason to suppose her more unblemished than the <lb/>
                    elder. Her modesty seemed unaffected, and was by no <lb/> means satisfied, like
                    that of the elder, with defeating future <lb/> curiosity. The consciousness of
                    what had already been <lb/> exposed filled her with confusion, and she would
                    have flown <lb/> away, if her companion had not detained her by some <lb/>
                    degree of force. What ails the girl? There's nothing to <lb/> be frightened at.
                    Fellow! she repeated, what brings you <lb/> here?</p>
                <p>I advanced and stood before them. I looked steadfastly, <lb/> but, I believe,
                    with neither effrontery nor anger, on the one <lb/> who addressed me. I spoke in
                    a tone serious and <reg orig="emphati-|cal">emphatical</reg>. <lb/> I come for
                    the sake of speaking to a woman, who <lb/> formerly resided in this house, and
                    probably resides here <lb/> still. Her name is Clemenza Lodi. If she be here, I
                        <reg orig="re-|quest">request</reg>
                    <lb/> you to conduct me to her instantly.</p>

                </pb>
                <p>Methought I preceived some inquietude, a less imperious <lb/> and more
                    inquisitive air, in this woman, on hearing the name <lb/> of Clemenza. It was
                    momentary, and gave way to <reg orig="peremp-|tory">peremptory</reg>
                    <lb/> looks. What is your business with her? And why <lb/> did you adopt this
                    mode of inquiry? A very extraordinary <lb/> intrusion! Be good enough to leave
                    the chamber. Any <lb/> questions proper to be answered, will be answered
                    below.</p>
                <p>I meant not to intrude or offend. It was not an idle or <lb/> impertinent motive
                    that led me hither. I waited below for <lb/> some time after soliciting an
                    audience of you, through the <lb/> servant. She assured me you were absent, and
                    laid me <lb/> under the necessity of searching for Clemenza Lodi myself, <lb/>
                    and without a guide. I am anxious to withdraw, and <reg orig="re-|quest"
                        >request</reg>
                    <lb/> merely to be directed to the room which she occupies.</p>
                <p>I direct you, replied she in a more resolute tone, to quit <lb/> the room and the
                    house.</p>
                <p>Impossible, madam, I replied, still looking at her earnestly, <lb/> leave the
                    house without seeing her! You might as well <lb/> enjoin me to pull the Andes on
                    my head! To walk <reg orig="bare-|foot">barefoot</reg>
                    <lb/> to Pekin! Impossible!</p>
                <p>Some solicitude was now mingled with her anger. This <lb/> is strange insolence!
                    unaccountable behaviour!&mdash;be gone <lb/> from my room! will you compel me to
                    call the gentlemen?</p>
                <p>Be not alarmed, said I, with augmented mildness. There <lb/> was indeed
                    compassion and sorrow at my heart, and these <lb/> must have somewhat influenced
                    my looks. Be not alarmed. <lb/> I came to confer a benefit, not to perpetrate an
                    injury. I <lb/> came not to censure or expostulate with you, but merely to <lb/>
                    counsel and aid a being that needs both; all I want is to see <lb/> her. In this
                    chamber I sought not you, but her. Only lead <lb/> me to her, or tell me where
                    she is. I will then rid you of <lb/> my presence.</p>
                <p>Will you compel me to call those who will punish this <lb/> insolence as it
                    deserves?</p>
                <p>Dearest madam! I compel you to nothing. I merely <lb/> supplicate. I would ask
                    you to lead me to these gentlemen, <lb/> if I did not know that there are none
                    but females in the <lb/> house. It is you who must receive and comply with my
                    <lb/> petition. Allow me a moment's interview with Clemenza <lb/>
                    <pb n="94" entity="eaf033v2_0303" pid="uva-lib:349610"/> Lodi. Compliance will
                    harm you not, but will benefit her. <lb/> What is your objection?</p>
                <p>This is the strangest proceeding! the most singular <reg orig="con-|duct"
                        >conduct</reg>! <lb/> Is this a place fit to parley with you? I warn you
                    <lb/> of the consequence of staying a moment longer. Depend <lb/> upon it, you
                    will sorely repent it.</p>
                <p>You are obdurate, said I, and turned towards the <reg orig="youn-|ger"
                        >younger</reg>, <lb/> who listened to this discourse in tremors and panic. I
                    <lb/> took her hand with an air of humility and reverence. Here, <lb/> said I,
                    there seems to be purity, innocence and <reg orig="condescen-|sion"
                        >condescension</reg>. <lb/> I took this house to be the temple of
                    voluptuousness. <lb/> Females, I expected to find in it, but such only as traded
                    in <lb/> licentious pleasures; specious, perhaps not destitute of talents, <lb/>
                    beauty and address, but dissolute and wanton; sensual and <lb/> avaricious; yet,
                    in this countenance and carriage there are <lb/> tokens of virtue. I am born to
                    be deceived, and the <reg orig="sem-|blance">semblance</reg>
                    <lb/> of modesty is readily assumed. Under this veil, <lb/> perhaps, lurk a
                    tainted heart and depraved appetites. Is <lb/> it so?</p>
                <p>She made me no answer, but somewhat in her looks <lb/> seemed to evince that my
                    favorable prepossessions were just. <lb/> I noticed likewise that the alarm of
                    the elder was greatly <lb/> increased by this address to her companion. The
                    thought <lb/> suddenly occurred that this girl might be in circumstances <lb/>
                    not unlike those of Clemenza Lodi; that she was not <reg orig="ap-|prized"
                        >apprized</reg>
                    <lb/> of the character of her associates, and might by this <lb/> meeting be
                    rescued from similar evils.</p>
                <p>This suspicion filled me with tumultuous feelings. <reg orig="Cle-|menza"
                        >Clemenza</reg>
                    <lb/> was for a time forgotten. I paid no attention to the <lb/> looks or
                    demeanor of the elder, but was wholly occupied in <lb/> gazing on the younger.
                    My anxiety to know the truth, gave <lb/> pathos and energy to my tones, while I
                    spoke:</p>
                <p>Who, where, what are you? Do you reside in this house? <lb/> Are you a sister or
                    daughter in this family, or merely a <reg orig="visit-|ant">visitant</reg>?
                    <lb/> Do you know the character, profession and views of <lb/> your companions?
                    Do you deem them virtuous, or know <lb/> them to be profligate? Speak! tell me,
                    I beseech you!</p>
                <p>The maiden confusion which had just appeared in the <lb/> countenance of this
                    person, now somewhat abated. She <lb/> lifted her eyes, and glanced by turns at
                    me and at her who <lb/> sat by her side. An air of serious astonishment
                    overspread <lb/>
                    <pb n="95" entity="eaf033v2_0304" pid="uva-lib:349611"/> her features, and she
                    seemed anxious for me to proceed. <lb/> The elder, meanwhile, betrayed the
                    utmost alarm, again <lb/> upbraided my audacity, commanded me to withdraw, and
                    <lb/> admonished me of the danger I incurred by lingering.</p>
                <p>I noticed not her interference, but again entreated to know <lb/> of the younger
                    her true state. She had no time to answer <lb/> me, supposing her not to want
                    the inclination, for every <lb/> pause was filled by the clamorous importunities
                    and menaces <lb/> of the other. I began to perceive that my attempts were <lb/>
                    useless to this end, but the chief, and most estimable <reg orig="pur-|pose"
                        >purpose</reg>, <lb/> was attainable. It was in my power to state the <lb/>
                    knowledge I possessed, through your means, of Mrs. <reg orig="Vil-|lars"
                        >Villars</reg>
                    <lb/> and her daughters. This information might be <reg orig="super-|fluous"
                        >superfluous</reg>, <lb/> since she to whom it was given, might be one of
                    this <lb/> licentious family. The contrary, however, was not <reg
                        orig="impro-|bable">improbable</reg>, <lb/> and my tidings, therefore, might
                    be of the utmost <lb/> moment to her safety.</p>
                <p>A resolute, and even impetuous manner, reduced my <reg orig="in-|cessant"
                        >incessant</reg>
                    <lb/> interrupter to silence. What I had to say, I <reg orig="com-|pressed"
                        >compressed</reg>
                    <lb/> in a few words, and adhered to perspicuity and <lb/> candor with the
                    utmost care. I still held the hand that I <lb/> had taken, and fixed my eyes
                    upon her countenance, with <lb/> a steadfastness that hindered her from lifting
                    her eyes.</p>
                <p>I know you not; whether you be dissolute or chaste, I <lb/> cannot tell. In
                    either case, however, what I am going to <lb/> say will be useful. Let me
                    faithfully repeat what I have <lb/> heard. It is mere rumor, and I vouch not for
                    its truth. <lb/> Rumor as it is, I submit it to your judgment, and hope that
                    <lb/> it may guide you into paths of innocence and honor.</p>
                <p>Mrs. Villars and her three daughters are English women, <lb/> who supported for a
                    time an unblemished reputation, but <lb/> who, at length, were suspected of
                    carrying on the trade <lb/> of prostitution. This secret could not be concealed
                        <reg orig="for-|ever">forever</reg>. <lb/> The profligates who frequented
                    their house, <reg orig="be-|trayed">betrayed</reg>
                    <lb/> them. One of them who who died under their <lb/> roof, after they had
                    withdrawn from it into the country, <reg orig="dis-|closed">disclosed</reg>
                    <lb/> to his kinsman, who attended his death bed, their <lb/> genuine
                    character.</p>
                <p>The dying man likewise related incidents in which I am <lb/> deeply concerned. I
                    have been connected with one by <lb/> name Welbeck. In his house I met an
                    unfortunate girl, <lb/>
                    <pb n="96" entity="eaf033v2_0305" pid="uva-lib:349612"/> who was afterwards
                    removed to Mrs. Villars's. Her name <lb/> was Clemenza Lodi. Residence in this
                    house, under the <lb/> control of a woman like Mrs. Villars and her daughters,
                    <lb/> must be injurious to her innocence, and from this control I <lb/> now come
                    to rescue her.</p>
                <p>I turned to the elder, and continued; by all that is <reg orig="sa-|cred"
                        >sacred</reg>, <lb/> I adjure you to tell me whether Clemenza Lodi be <lb/>
                    under this roof! If she be not, whither has she gone? To <lb/> know this I came
                    hither, and any difficulty or reluctance in <lb/> answering, will be useless;
                    till an answer be obtained, I <lb/> will not go hence.</p>
                <p>During this speech, anger had been kindling in the bosom <lb/> of this woman. It
                    now burst upon me in a torrent of <reg orig="op-|probrious">opprobrious</reg>
                    <lb/> epithets. I was a villain, a calumniator, a thief. <lb/> I had lurked
                    about the house, till those whose sex and <lb/> strength enabled them to cope
                    with me, had gone. I had <lb/> entered these doors by fraud. I was a wretch,
                    guilty of the <lb/> last excesses of insolence and insult.</p>
                <p>To repel these reproaches, or endure them, was equally <lb/> useless. The
                    satisfaction that I sought was only to be <lb/> gained by searching the house. I
                    left the room without <lb/> speaking. Did I act illegally in passing from one
                    story and <lb/> one room to another? Did I really deserve the imputations <lb/>
                    of rashness and insolence? My behavior, I well know, was <lb/> ambiguous and
                    hazardous, and perhaps wanting in <reg orig="discre-|tion">discretion</reg>,
                    <lb/> but my motives were unquestionably pure. I aimed <lb/> at nothing but the
                    rescue of a human creature from distress <lb/> and dishonor.</p>
                <p>I pretend not to the wisdom of experience and age; to <lb/> the praise of
                    forethought or subtlety. I choose the obvious <lb/> path, and pursue it with
                    headlong expedition. Good <reg orig="inten-|tions">intentions</reg>, <lb/>
                    unaided by knowledge, will, perhaps, produce more <lb/> injury than benefit, and
                    therefore, knowledge must be <lb/> gained, but the acquisition is not momentary;
                    is not <reg orig="be-|stowed">bestowed</reg>
                    <lb/> unasked and untoiled for. Meanwhile, we must not <lb/> be inactive because
                    we are ignorant. Our good purposes <lb/> must hurry to performance, whether our
                    knowledge be <lb/> greater or less.</p>

                <p>Presently I reached a front chamber in the third story. <lb/> The door was ajar.
                    I entered it on tiptoe. Sitting on a <lb/> low chair by the fire, I beheld a

                    in the <lb/> posture in which she sat was only half seen. Its hues were <lb/>
                    sickly and pale, and in mournful unison with a feeble and <lb/> emaciated form.
                    Her eyes were fixed upon a babe, that <lb/> lay stretched upon a pillow at her
                    feet. The child, like its <lb/> mother, for such she was readily imagined to be,
                    was <reg orig="mea-|gre">meagre</reg>
                    <lb/> and cadaverous. Either it was dead, or could not be <lb/> very distant
                    from death.</p>
                <p>The features of Clemenza were easily recognised, though <lb/> no contrast could
                    be greater, in habit and shape, and <reg orig="com-|plexion">complexion</reg>,
                    <lb/> than that which her present bore to her former <lb/> appearance. All her
                    roses had faded, and her brilliancies <lb/> vanished. Still, however, there was
                    somewhat fitted to <lb/> awaken the tenderest emotions. There were tokens of
                        <reg orig="in-|consolable">inconsolable</reg>
                    <lb/> distress.</p>
                <p>Her attention was wholly absorbed by the child. She <lb/> lifted not her eyes,
                    till I came close to her, and stood before <lb/> her. When she discovered me, a
                    faint start was perceived. <lb/> She looked at me for a moment, then putting one
                    spread <lb/> hand before her eyes, she stretched out the other towards <lb/> the
                    door, and waving it in silence, as if to admonish me to <lb/> depart.</p>
                <p>This motion, however emphatical, I could not obey. I <lb/> wished to obtain her
                    attention, but knew not in what words <lb/> to claim it. I was silent. In a
                    moment she removed her <lb/> hand from her eyes, and looked at me with new
                    eagerness. <lb/> Her features bespoke emotions, which, perhaps, flowed from <lb/>
                    <pb n="98" entity="eaf033v2_0307" pid="uva-lib:349614"/> my likeness to her
                    brother, joined with the memory of my <lb/> connexion with Welbeck.</p>
                <p>My situation was full of embarrassment. I was by no <lb/> means certain that my
                    language would be understood. I <lb/> knew not in what light the policy and
                    dissimulation of <reg orig="Wel-|beck">Welbeck</reg>
                    <lb/> might have taught her to regard me. What proposal, <lb/> conducive to her
                    comfort and her safety, could I make to <lb/> her?</p>
                <p>Once more she covered her eyes, and exclaimed in a <lb/> feeble voice, go away!
                    begone!</p>
                <p>As if satisfied with this effort, she resumed her attention <lb/> to her child.
                    She stooped and lifted it in her arms, gazing, <lb/> meanwhile, on its almost
                    lifeless features with intense <reg orig="anxi-|ety">anxiety</reg>. <lb/> She
                    crushed it to her bosom, and again looking at <lb/> me, repeated, go away! go
                    away! begone!</p>
                <p>There was somewhat in the lines of her face, in her tones <lb/> and gestures,
                    that pierced to my heart. Added to this, was <lb/> my knowledge of her
                    condition; her friendlessness; her <lb/> poverty; the pangs of unrequited love;
                    and her expiring <lb/> infant. I felt my utterance choked, and my tears <reg
                        orig="strug-|gling">struggling</reg>
                    <lb/> for passage. I turned to the window, and endeavored <lb/> to regain my
                    tranquillity.</p>
                <p>What was it, said I, that brought me hither? The <reg orig="per-|fidy"
                        >perfidy</reg>
                    <lb/> of Welbeck must surely have long since been <reg orig="discov-|ered"
                        >discovered</reg>. <lb/> What can I tell her of the Villars which she does
                    not <lb/> already know, or of which the knowledge will be useful? <lb/> If their
                    treatment has been just, why should I detract from <lb/> their merit? If it has
                    been otherwise, their own conduct <lb/> will have disclosed their genuine
                    character. Though <reg orig="vo-|luptuous">voluptuous</reg>
                    <lb/> themselves, it does not follow that they have labored <lb/> to debase this
                    creature. Though wanton, they may not be <lb/> inhuman.</p>
                <p>I can propose no change in her condition for the better. <lb/> Should she be
                    willing to leave this house, whither is it in my <lb/> power to conduct her? O
                    that I were rich enough to <reg orig="pro-|vide">provide</reg>
                    <lb/> food for the hungry, shelter for the houseless, and <lb/> raiment for the
                    naked.</p>
                <p>I was roused from these fruitless reflections by the lady, <lb/> whom some sudden
                    thought induced to place the child in <lb/> its bed, and rising to come towards
                    me. The utter <reg orig="dejec-|tion">dejection</reg>
                    <lb/> which her features lately betrayed, was now changed <lb/>
                    <pb n="99" entity="eaf033v2_0308" pid="uva-lib:349615"/> for an air of anxious
                    curiosity. Where, said she, in her <lb/> broken English, where is Signior
                    Welbeck?</p>
                <p>Alas! returned I, I know not. That question might, I <lb/> thought, with more
                    propriety be put to you than me.</p>
                <p>I know where he be; I fear where he be.</p>
                <p>So saying, the deepest sighs burst from her heart. She <lb/> turned from me, and
                    going to the child, took it again into <lb/> her lap. Its pale and sunken cheek
                    was quickly wet with <lb/> the mother's tears, which, as she silently hung over
                    it, <reg orig="drop-|ped">dropped</reg>
                    <lb/> fast from her eyes.</p>
                <p>This demeanor could not but awaken curiosity, while it <lb/> gave a new turn to
                    my thoughts. I began to suspect that <lb/> in the tokens which I saw, there was
                    not only distress for <lb/> her child, but concern for the fate of Welbeck. Know
                    you, <lb/> said I, where Mr. Welbeck is? Is he alive? Is he near? <lb/> Is he in
                    calamity?</p>
                <p>I do not know if he be alive. He be sick. He be in <lb/> prison. They will not
                    let me go to him. And&mdash;here her <lb/> attention and mine was attracted by
                    the infant, whose frame, <lb/> till now motionless, began to be tremulous. Its
                    features <lb/> sunk into a more ghastly expression. Its breathings were <lb/>
                    difficult, and every effort to respire produced a convulsion <lb/> harder than
                    the last.</p>
                <p>The mother easily interpreted these tokens. The same <lb/> mortal struggle seemed
                    to take place in her features as in <lb/> those of her child. At length her
                    agony found way in a <lb/> piercing shriek. The struggle in the infant was past.
                    Hope <lb/> looked in vain for a new motion in its heart or its eyelids. <lb/>
                    The lips were closed, and its breath was gone, forever!</p>
                <p>The grief which overwhelmed the unhappy parent, was <lb/> of that outrageous and
                    desperate kind which is wholly <reg orig="in-|compatible">incompatible</reg>
                    <lb/> with thinking. A few incoherent motions and <lb/> screams, that rent the
                    soul, were followed by a deep swoon. <lb/> She sunk upon the floor, pale and
                    lifeless as her babe.</p>
                <p>I need not describe the pangs which such a scene was <lb/> adapted to produce in
                    me. These were rendered more <lb/> acute by the helpless and ambiguous situation
                    in which I <lb/> was placed. I was eager to bestow consolation and succor, <lb/>
                    but was destitute of all means. I was plunged into <reg orig="uncer-|tainties"
                        >uncertainties</reg>
                    <lb/> and doubts. I gazed alternately at the infant and <lb/> its mother. I
                    sighed. I wept. I even sobbed. I <reg orig="stoop-|ed">stooped</reg>
                    <lb/>
                    <pb n="100" entity="eaf033v2_0309" pid="uva-lib:349616"/> down and took the
                    lifeless hand of the sufferer. I <lb/> bathed it with my tears, and exclaimed,
                    ill-fated woman! <lb/> unhappy mother! what shall I do for thy relief? How <lb/>
                    shall I blunt the edge of this calamity, and rescue thee from <lb/> new
                    evils?</p>
                <p>At this moment the door of the apartment was opened, <lb/> and the youngest of
                    the women whom I had seen below, <lb/> entered. Her looks betrayed the deepest
                    consternation and <lb/> anxiety. Her eyes in a moment were fixed by the decayed
                    <lb/> form and the sad features of Clemenza. She shuddered <lb/> at this
                    spectacle, but was silent. She stood in the midst of <lb/> the floor,
                    fluctuating and bewildered. I dropped the hand <lb/> that I was holding, and
                    approached her.</p>
                <p>You have come, said I, in good season. I know you not, <lb/> but will believe you
                    to be good. You have a heart, it may <lb/> be, not free from corruption, but it
                    is still capable of pity for <lb/> the miseries of others. You have a hand that
                    refuses not <lb/> its aid to the unhappy. See; there is an infant dead. <lb/>
                    There is a mother whom grief has, for a time, deprived of <lb/> life. She has
                    been oppressed and betrayed; been robbed of <lb/> property and
                    reputation&mdash;but not of innocence. She is <lb/> worthy of relief. Have you
                    arms to receive her? Have <lb/> you sympathy, protection, and a home to bestow
                    upon a <lb/> forlorn, betrayed, and unhappy stranger? I know not what <lb/> this
                    house is; I suspect it to be no better than a brothel. I <lb/> know not what
                    treatment this woman has received. If, <lb/> when her situation and wants are
                    ascertained, will you <reg orig="sup-|ply">supply</reg>
                    <lb/> her wants? Will you rescue her from evils that may <lb/> attend her
                    continuance here?</p>
                <p>She was disconcerted and bewildered by this address. <lb/> At length she
                    said&mdash;All that has happened, all that I have <lb/> heard and seen is so
                    unexpected, so strange, that I am <lb/> amazed and distracted. Your behavior I
                    cannot <reg orig="compre-|hend">comprehend</reg>, <lb/> nor your motive for
                    making this address to me. I <lb/> cannot answer you, except in one respect. If
                    this woman <lb/> has suffered injury, I have had no part in it. I knew not of
                    <lb/> her existence, nor her situation till this moment; and <reg
                        orig="what-|ever">whatever</reg>
                    <lb/> protection or assistance she may justly claim, I am both <lb/> able and
                    willing to bestow. I do not live here, but in the <lb/> city. I am only an
                    occasional visitant in this house.</p>
                <pb n="101" entity="eaf033v2_0310" pid="uva-lib:349617"/>
                <p>What then, I exclaimed, with sparkling eyes and a <reg orig="rap-|turous"
                        >rapturous</reg>
                    <lb/> accent, you are not profligate; are a stranger to the <lb/> manners of
                    this house, and a detester of these manners? <lb/> Be not a deceiver, I entreat
                    you. I depend only on your <lb/> looks and professions, and these may be
                    dissembled.</p>
                <p>These questions, which indeed argued a childish <reg orig="simpli-|city"
                        >simplicity</reg>, <lb/> excited her surprise. She looked at me, uncertain
                    <lb/> whether I was in earnest or in jest. At length she said, <lb/> your
                    language is so singular, that I am at a loss how to <reg orig="an-|swer"
                        >answer</reg>
                    <lb/> it. I shall take no pains to find out its meaning, but <lb/> leave you to
                    form conjectures at leisure. Who is this <reg orig="wo-|man">woman</reg>, <lb/>
                    and how can I serve her? After a pause, she <reg orig="con-|tinued&mdash;I"
                        >continued&mdash;I</reg>
                    <lb/> cannot afford her any immediate assistance, and <lb/> shall not stay a
                    moment longer in this house. There, <reg orig="(put-|ting">(putting</reg>
                    <lb/> a card in my hand) is my name and place of abode. <lb/> If you shall have
                    any proposals to make, respecting this <reg orig="wo-|man">woman</reg>, <lb/> I
                    shall be ready to receive them in my own house. <lb/> So saying, she
                    withdrew.</p>
                <p>I looked wistfully after her, but could not but assent to <lb/> her assertion,
                    that her presence here would be more <reg orig="injuri-|ous">injurious</reg>
                    <lb/> to her than beneficial to Clemenza. She had scarcely <lb/> gone, when the
                    elder woman entered. There was rage, <lb/> sullenness, and disappointment in her
                    aspect. These, <reg orig="how-|ever">however</reg>, <lb/> were suspended by the
                    situation in which she <reg orig="discover-|ed">discovered</reg>
                    <lb/> the mother and child. It was plain that all the <reg orig="senti-|ments"
                        >sentiments</reg>
                    <lb/> of woman were not extinguished in her heart. She <lb/> summoned the
                    servants and seemed preparing to take such <lb/> measures as the occasion
                    prescribed. I now saw the folly <lb/> of supposing that these measures would be
                    neglected, and <lb/> that my presence could not essentially contribute to the
                    <lb/> benefit of the sufferer. Still, however, I lingered in the <lb/> room,
                    till the infant was covered with a cloth, and the still <lb/> senseless parent
                    was conveyed into an adjoining chamber. <lb/> The woman then, as if she had not
                    seen me before, fixed <lb/> scowling eyes upon me, and exclaimed, thief!
                    villain! why <lb/> do you stay here?</p>
                <p>I mean to go, said I, but not till I express my gratitude <lb/> and pleasure, at
                    the sight of your attention to this sufferer. <lb/> You deem me insolent and
                    perverse, but I am not such; <lb/> and hope that the day will come when I shall
                    convince you <lb/> of my good intentions.</p>
                <pb n="102" entity="eaf033v2_0311" pid="uva-lib:349618"/>
                <p>Begone! interrupted she, in a more angry tone. Begone <lb/> this moment, or I
                    will treat you as a thief. She now drew <lb/> forth her hand from under her
                    gown, and shewed a <reg orig="pis-|tol">pistol</reg>. <lb/> You shall see, she
                    continued, that I will not be <reg orig="insult-|ed">insulted</reg>
                    <lb/> with impunity. If you do not vanish, I will shoot you as <lb/> a
                    robber.</p>
                <p>This woman was far from wanting a force and intrepidity <lb/> worthy of a
                    different sex. Her gestures and tones were <lb/> full of energy. They denoted a
                    haughty and indignant <lb/> spirit. It was plain that she conceived herself
                    deeply <lb/> injured by my conduct; and was it absolutely certain that <lb/> her
                    anger was without reason? I had loaded her house with <lb/> atrocious
                    imputations, and these imputations might be false. <lb/> I had conceived them
                    upon such evidence as chance had <lb/> provided, but this evidence, intricate
                    and dubious as human <lb/> actions and motives are, might be void of truth.</p>
                <p>Perhaps, said I, in a sedate tone, I have injured you; I <lb/> have mistaken your
                    character. You shall not find me less <lb/> ready to repair, than to perpetrate,
                    this injury. My error <lb/> was without malice, and&mdash;</p>
                <p>I had not time to finish the sentence, when this rash and <lb/> enraged woman
                    thrust the pistol close to my head and fired <lb/> it. I was wholly unaware that
                    her fury would lead her to <lb/> this excess. It was a sort of mechanical
                    impulse that made <lb/> me raise my hand, and attempt to turn aside the weapon.
                    <lb/> I did this deliberately and tranquilly, and without <reg

                    <lb/> that any thing more was intended by her movement than <lb/> to intimidate
                    me. To this precaution, however, I was <reg orig="in-|debted">indebted</reg>
                    <lb/> for life. The bullet was diverted from my forehead <lb/> to my left ear,
                    and made a slight wound upon the furface, <lb/> from which the blood gushed in a
                    stream.</p>
                <p>The loudness of this explosion, and the shock which the <lb/> hall produced in my
                    brain, sunk me into a momentary <reg orig="stu-|por">stupor</reg>. <lb/> I
                    reeled backward, and should have fallen, had not I <lb/> supported myself
                    against the wall. The sight of my blood <lb/> instantly restored her reason. Her
                    rage disappeared, and <lb/> was succeeded by terror and remorse. She clasped her
                    <lb/> hands, and exclaimed&mdash;Oh! what! what have I done? My <lb/> frantic
                    passion has destroyed me.</p>
                <p>I needed no long time to show me the full extent of the <lb/> injury which I had
                    suffered and the conduct which it became <lb/>
                    <pb n="103" entity="eaf033v2_0312" pid="uva-lib:349619"/> me to adopt. For a
                    moment I was bewildered and <reg orig="alarm-|ed">alarmed</reg>, <lb/> but
                    presently perceived that this was an incident more <lb/> productive of good than
                    of evil. It would teach me caution <lb/> in contending with the passions of
                    another, and shewed me <lb/> that there is a limit which the impetuosities of
                    anger will <lb/> sometimes overstep. Instead of reviling my companion, I <lb/>
                    addressed myself to her thus:</p>
                <p>Be not frighted. You have done me no injury, and I <lb/> hope will derive
                    instruction from this event. Your rashness <lb/> had like to have sacrificed the
                    life of one who is your friend, <lb/> and to have exposed yourself to infamy and
                    death, or, at <lb/> least, to the pangs of eternal remorse. Learn, from hence,
                    <lb/> to curb your passions, and especially to keep at a distance <lb/> from
                    every murderous weapon, on occasions when rage is <lb/> likely to take place of
                    reason.</p>
                <p>I repeat that my motives in entering this house were <reg orig="con-|nected"
                        >connected</reg>
                    <lb/> with your happiness as well as that of Clemenza <lb/> Lodi. If I have
                    erred, in supposing you the member of a <lb/> vile and pernicious trade, that
                    error was worthy of being <lb/> rectified, but violence and invective tend only
                    to confirm it. <lb/> I am incapable of any purpose that is not beneficent; but,
                    <lb/> in the means that I use and in the evidence on which I <reg
                        orig="pro-|ceed">proceed</reg>, <lb/> I am liable to a thousand mistakes.
                    Point out to me <lb/> the road by which I can do you good, and I will cheerfully
                    <lb/> pursue it.</p>
                <p>Finding that her fears had been groundless, as to the <reg orig="con-|sequences"
                        >consequences</reg>
                    <lb/> of her rashness, she renewed, though with less <lb/> vehemence than
                    before, her imprecations on my <reg orig="intermed-|dling">intermeddling</reg>
                    <lb/> and audacious folly. I listened till the storm was <lb/> nearly exhausted,
                    and then, declaring my intention to revisit <lb/> the house, if the interest of
                    Clemenza should require it, I <lb/> resumed my way to the city.</p>

                    mine?</p>
                <p>To indulge an adventurous spirit, I left the precincts of <lb/> the barn door,
                    enlisted in the service of a stranger, and <reg orig="en-|countered"

                    <lb/> influence of Welbeck. Afterwards my life was set <lb/> at hazard in the
                    cause of Wallace, and now am I loaded <lb/> with the province of protecting the
                    helpless Eliza Hadwin <lb/> and the unfortunate Clemenza. My wishes are fervent,
                    and <lb/> my powers shall not be inactive in their defence, but how <lb/>
                    slender are these powers!</p>
                <p>In the offers of the unknown lady there is, indeed, some <lb/> consolation for
                    Clemenza. It must be my business to lay <lb/> before my friend Stevens the
                    particulars of what has <reg orig="befal-|len">befallen</reg>
                    <lb/> me, and to entreat his directions how this disconsolate girl <lb/> may be
                    most effectually succored. It may be wise to take <lb/> her from her present
                    abode, and place her under some <lb/> chaste and humane guardianship, where she
                    may gradually <lb/> lose remembrance of her dead infant and her specious <reg
                        orig="be-|trayer">betrayer</reg>. <lb/> The barrier that severs her from
                    Welbeck must be <lb/> high as heaven and insuperable as necessity.</p>
                <p>But, soft! Talked she not of Welbeck? Said she not <lb/> that he was in prison
                    and was sick? Poor wretch! I <lb/> thought thy course was at an end; that the
                    penalty of guilt <lb/> no longer weighed down thy heart. That thy misdeeds <lb/>
                    and thy remorses were buried in a common and obscure <lb/> grave; but it seems
                    thou art still alive.</p>
                <p>Is it rational to cherish the hope of thy restoration to <reg orig="in-|nocence"
                        >innocence</reg>
                    <lb/> and peace? Thou art no obdurate criminal; hadst <lb/> thou less virtue,
                    thy compunctions would be less keen. <lb/> Wert thou deaf to the voice of duty,
                    thy wanderings into <lb/> guilt and folly would be less fertile of anguish. The
                    time <lb/> will perhaps come, when the measure of thy transgressions <lb/> and
                    calamities will overflow, and the folly of thy choice <lb/> will be too

                <p>But, thou art imprisoned and art sick. This, perhaps, <lb/> is the crisis of thy
                    destiny. Indigence and dishonor were <lb/> the evils, to shun which thy
                    integrity and peace of mind <lb/> have been lightly forfeited. Thou hast found
                    that the price <lb/> was given in vain; that the hollow and deceitful enjoyments
                    <lb/> of opulence and dignity were not worth the purchase; and <lb/> that,
                    frivolous and unsubstantial as they are, the only path <lb/> that leads to them
                    is that of honesty and diligence. Thou <lb/> art in prison and art sick; and
                    there is none to cheer thy <lb/> hour with offices of kindness, or uphold thy
                    fainting courage <lb/> by the suggestions of good counsel. For such as thou the
                    <lb/> world has no compassion. Mankind will pursue thee to the <lb/> grave with
                    execrations. Their cruelty will be justified or <lb/> palliated, since they know
                    thee not. They are unacquainted <lb/> with the goadings of thy conscience and
                    the bitter <reg orig="retribu-|tions">retributions</reg>
                    <lb/> which thou art daily suffering. They are full of their <lb/> own wrongs,
                    and think only of those tokens of exultation <lb/> and complacency which thou
                    wast studious of assuming <lb/> in thy intercourse with them. It is I only that
                    thoroughly <lb/> know thee, and can rightly estimate thy claims to <reg
                        orig="com-|passion">compassion</reg>.</p>
                <p>I have somewhat partaken of thy kindness, and thou <lb/> meritest some gratitude
                    at my hands. Shall I not visit and <lb/> endeavor to console thee in thy
                    distress? Let me, at least, <lb/> ascertain thy condition, and be the instrument
                    in repairing <lb/> the wrongs which thou hast inflicted. Let me gain, from <lb/>
                    the contemplation of thy misery, new motives to sincerity <lb/> and
                    rectitude.</p>
                <p>While occupied by these reflections, I entered the city. <lb/> The thoughts which
                    engrossed my mind related to Welbeck. <lb/> It is not my custom to defer till
                    tomorrow what can be done <lb/> to day. The destiny of man frequently hangs upon
                    the lapse <lb/> of a minute. I will stop, said I, at the prison; and, since
                    <lb/> the moment of my arrival may not be indifferent, I will go <lb/> thither
                    with all possible haste. I did not content myself <lb/> with walking, but,
                    regardless of the comments of passengers, <lb/> hurried along the way at full
                    speed.</p>
                <p>Having inquired for Welbeck, I was conducted through a <lb/> dark room, crowded
                    with beds, to a staircase. Never <reg orig="be-|fore">before</reg>
                    <lb/> had I been in a prison. Never had I smelt so <reg orig="noi-|some"
                        >noisome</reg>
                    <lb/>
                    <pb n="106" entity="eaf033v2_0315" pid="uva-lib:349622"/> an odour, or surveyed
                    faces so begrimed with filth <lb/> and misery. The walls and floors were alike
                    squalid and <lb/> detestable. It seemed that in this house existence would <lb/>
                    be bereaved of all its attractions; and yet those faces, <lb/> which could be
                    seen through the obscurity that <reg orig="encom-|passed">encompassed</reg>
                    <lb/> them, were either void of care or distorted with <lb/> mirth.</p>
                <p>This, said I, as I followed my conductor, is the residence <lb/> of Welbeck. What
                    contrasts are these to the repose and <lb/> splendor, pictured walls, glossy
                    hangings, gilded sofas, <reg orig="mir-|rors">mirrors</reg>
                    <lb/> that occupied from ceiling to floor, carpets of Tauris, <lb/> and the
                    spotless and transcendent brilliancy of coverlets and <lb/> napkins, in thy
                    former dwelling? Here brawling and the <lb/> shuffling of rude feet are eternal.
                    The air is loaded with <lb/> the exhalations of disease and the fumes of
                    debauchery. <lb/> Thou art cooped up in airless space, and, perhaps, <reg
                        orig="compel-|led">compelled</reg>
                    <lb/> to share thy narrow cell with some stupid ruffian. <reg orig="For-|merly"
                        >Formerly</reg>, <lb/> the breezes were courted by thy lofty windows. <lb/>
                    Aromatic shrubs were scattered on thy hearth. Menials, <lb/> splendid in
                    apparel, showed their faces with diffidence in thy <lb/> apartment, trod lightly
                    on thy marble floor, and suffered not <lb/> the sanctity of silence to be
                    troubled by a whisper. Thy <lb/> lamp shot its rays through the transparency of
                    alabaster, <lb/> and thy fragrant lymph flowed from vases of porcelain. <lb/>
                    Such were formerly the decorations of thy hall, the <reg orig="embel-|lishments"
                        >embellishments</reg>
                    <lb/> of thy existence; but now&mdash;alas!&mdash;</p>
                <p>We reached a chamber in the second story. My <reg orig="con-|ductor"
                        >conductor</reg>
                    <lb/> knocked at the door. No one answered. Repeated <lb/> knocks were unheard
                    or unnoticed by the person within. <lb/> At length, lifting a latch, we entered
                    together.</p>
                <p>The prisoner lay upon the bed, with his face turned from <lb/> the door. I
                    advanced softly, making a sign to the keeper <lb/> to withdraw. Welbeck was not
                    asleep, but merely buried <lb/> in reverie. I was unwilling to disturb his
                    musing, and stood <lb/> with my eyes fixed upon his form. He appeared <reg
                        orig="uncon-|scious">unconscious</reg>
                    <lb/> that any one had entered.</p>
                <p>At length, uttering a deep sigh, he changed his posture, <lb/> and perceived me
                    in my motionless and gazing attitude. <lb/> Recollect in what circumstances we
                    had last parted. <reg orig="Wel-|beck">Welbeck</reg>
                    <lb/> had, no doubt, carried away with him, from that <reg orig="inter-|view"
                        >interview</reg>, <lb/>
                    <pb n="107" entity="eaf033v2_0316" pid="uva-lib:349623"/> a firm belief, that I
                    should speedily die. His <reg orig="prog-|nostic">prognostic</reg>, <lb/>
                    however, was fated to be contradicted.</p>
                <p>His first emotions were those of surprise. These gave place <lb/> to
                    mortification and rage. After eyeing me for some time, <lb/> be averted his
                    glances, and that effort which is made to <reg orig="dis-|sipate"
                        >dissipate</reg>
                    <lb/> some obstacle to breathing, showed me that his <reg orig="sensa-|tions"
                        >sensations</reg>
                    <lb/> were of the most excruciating kind. He laid his head <lb/> upon the
                    pillow, and sunk into his former musing. He <reg orig="dis-|dained"
                        >disdained</reg>, <lb/> or was unable, to utter a syllable of welcome or
                    <lb/> contempt.</p>
                <p>In the opportunity that had been afforded me to view his <lb/> countenance, I had
                    observed tokens of a kind very <reg orig="differ-|ent">different</reg>
                    <lb/> from those which used to be visible. The gloomy and <lb/> malignant were
                    more conspicuous. Health had forsaken his <lb/> cheeks, and taken along with it
                    those flexible parts, which <lb/> formerly enabled him to cover his secret
                    torments and <reg orig="in-|sidious">insidious</reg>
                    <lb/> purposes, beneath a veil of benevolence and <reg orig="cheer-|fulness"
                        >cheerfulness</reg>. <lb/> Alas! said I, loud enough for him to hear me,
                    <lb/> here is a monument of ruin. Despair and mischievous <lb/> passions are too
                    deeply rooted in this heart for me to tear <lb/> them away.</p>
                <p>These expressions did not escape his notice. He turned <lb/> once more and cast
                    sullen looks upon me. There was <lb/> somewhat in his eyes that made me shudder.
                    They denoted <lb/> that his reverie was not that of grief, but of madness. I
                    <lb/> continued, in a less steadfast voice than before:</p>
                <p>Unhappy Clemenza! I have performed thy message. <lb/> I have visited him that is
                    sick and in prison. Thou hadst <lb/> cause for anguish and terror, even greater
                    cause than thou <lb/> imaginedst. Would to God that thou wouldst be contented
                    <lb/> with the report which I shall make; that thy misguided <reg
                        orig="ten-|derness">tenderness</reg>
                    <lb/> would consent to leave him to his destiny, would <lb/> suffer him to die
                    alone; but that is a forbearance which no <lb/> eloquence that I possess will
                    induce thee to practise. Thou <lb/> must come, and witness for thyself.</p>
                <p>In speaking thus, I was far from foreseeing the effects <lb/> which would be
                    produced on the mind of Welbeck. I was <lb/> far from intending to instil into
                    him a belief that Clemenza <lb/> was near at hand, and was preparing to enter
                    his apartment; <lb/> yet no other images but these would, perhaps, have roused
                    <lb/> him from his lethargy, and awakened that attention which I <lb/>
                    <pb n="108" entity="eaf033v2_0317" pid="uva-lib:349624"/> wished to awaken. He
                    started up, and gazed fearfully at <lb/> the door.</p>
                <p>What! he cried. What! Is she here? Ye powers, <lb/> that have scattered woes in
                    my path, spare me the sight of <lb/> her! But from this agony I will rescue
                    myself. The <reg orig="mo-|ment">moment</reg>
                    <lb/> she appears I will pluck out these eyes and dash them <lb/> at her
                    feet.</p>
                <p>So saying, he gazed with augmented eagerness upon the <lb/> door. His hands were
                    lifted to his head, as if ready to <reg orig="ex-|ecute">execute</reg>
                    <lb/> his frantic purpose. I seized his arm and besought <lb/> him to lay aside
                    his terror, for that Clemenza was far <reg orig="dis-|tant">distant</reg>. <lb/>
                    She had no intention, and besides was unable, to visit <lb/> him.</p>
                <p>Then I am respited. I breathe again. No; keep her <lb/> from a prison. Drag her
                    to the wheel or to the scaffold; <lb/> mangle her with stripes; torture her with
                    famine; strangle <lb/> her child before her face, and cast it to the hungry dogs
                    <lb/> that are howling at the gate; but&mdash;keep her from a prison. <lb/>
                    Never let her enter these doors.&mdash;There he stopped; his <lb/> eyes being
                    fixed on the floor, and his thoughts once more <lb/> buried in reverie. I
                    resumed:</p>
                <p>She is occupied with other griefs than those connected <lb/> with the fate of
                    Welbeck. She is not unmindful of you; <lb/> she knows you to be sick and in
                    prison; and I came to do <lb/> for you whatever office your condition might
                    require, and I <lb/> came at her suggestion. She, alas! has full employment
                    <lb/> for her tears in watering the grave of her child.</p>
                <p>He started. What! dead? Say you that the child is <lb/> dead?</p>
                <p>It is dead. I witnessed its death. I saw it expire in the <lb/> arms of its
                    mother; that mother whom I formerly met under <lb/> your roof blooming and gay,
                    but whom calamity has <reg orig="tar-|nished">tarnished</reg>
                    <lb/> and withered. I saw her in the raiment of poverty, <lb/> under an accursed
                    roof; desolate; alone; unsolaced by the <lb/> countenance or sympathy of human
                    beings; approached <reg orig="on-|ly">only</reg>
                    <lb/> by those who mock at her distress, set snares for her <reg
                        orig="in-|nocence">innocence</reg>, <lb/> and push her to infamy. I saw her
                    leaning over <lb/> the face of her dying babe.</p>
                <p>Welbeck put his hands to his head and exclaimed; curses <lb/> on thy lips,
                    infernal messenger! Chant elsewhere thy <reg orig="rue-|ful">rueful</reg>

                    blood less guilty than thine.</p>
                <p>Till this moment the uproar in Welbeck's mind appeared <lb/> to hinder him from
                    distinctly recognising his visitant. Now <lb/> it seemed as if the incidents of
                    our last interview suddenly <lb/> spring up in his remembrance.</p>
                <p>What! This is the villain that rifled my cabinet, the <lb/> maker of my poverty
                    and of all the evils which it has since <lb/> engendered! That has led me to a
                    prison! Execrable <lb/> fool! you are the author of the scene that you describe,
                    and <lb/> of horrors without number and name. To whatever crimes <lb/> I have

                        >madness</reg>
                    <lb/> that made you destroy my property, they spring from <lb/> your act; they
                    flowed from necessity, which, had you held <lb/> your hand at that fateful
                    moment, would never have <reg orig="ex-|isted">existed</reg>.</p>
                <p>How dare you thrust yourself upon my privacy? Why <lb/> am I not alone? Fly! and
                    let my miseries want, at least, <lb/> the aggravation of beholding their author.
                    My eyes loathe <lb/> the sight of thee! My heart would suffocate thee with its
                    <lb/> own bitterness! Begone!</p>
                <p>I know not, I answered, why innocence should tremble <lb/> at the ravings of a
                    lunatic; why it should be overwhelmed <lb/> by unmerited reproaches! Why it
                    should not deplore the <lb/> errors of its foe, labor to correct those errors,
                    and&mdash;</p>
                <p>Thank thy fate, youth, that my hands are tied up by my <lb/> scorn; thank thy
                    fate that no weapon is within reach. Much <lb/> has passed since I saw thee, and
                    I am a new man. I am <lb/> no longer inconstant and cowardly. I have no motives
                    but <lb/> contempt to hinder me from expiating the wrongs which <lb/> thou hast
                    done me in thy blood. I disdain to take thy life. <lb/> Go; and let thy
                    fidelity, at least, to the confidence which I <lb/> have placed in thee, be
                    inviolate. Thou hast done me <lb/> harm enough, but canst do, if thou wilt,
                    still more. Thou <lb/> canst betray the secrets that are lodged in thy bosom,
                    and <lb/> rob me of the comfort of reflecting that my guilt is known <lb/> but
                    to one among the living.</p>
                <p>This suggestion made me pause, and look back upon the <lb/> past. I had confided
                    this man's tale to you. The secrecy <lb/>
                    <pb n="110" entity="eaf033v2_0319" pid="uva-lib:349626"/> on which he so fondly
                    leaned, was at an end. Had I acted <lb/> culpably or not?</p>
                <p>But why should I ruminate, with anguish and doubt, <reg orig="up-|on">upon</reg>
                    <lb/> the past? The future was within my power, and the <lb/> road of my duty
                    was too plain to be mistaken. I would <lb/> disclose to Welbeck the truth, and
                    cheerfully encounter <lb/> every consequence. I would summon my friend to my
                    aid, <lb/> and take his counsel in the critical emergency in which I <lb/> was
                    placed. I ought not to rely upon myself alone in my <lb/> efforts to benefit
                    this being, when another was so near whose <lb/> discernment, and benevolence,
                    and knowledge of mankind, <lb/> and power of affording relief were far superior
                    to mine.</p>
                <p>Influenced by these thoughts, I left the apartment without <lb/> speaking; and,
                    procuring pen and paper, despatched to you <lb/> the billet which brought about
                    our meeting.</p>

                <p><hi rend="small-caps">Mervyn's</hi> auditors allowed no pause in their attention
                    to <lb/> this story. Having ended, a deep silence took place. The <lb/> clock
                    which stood upon the mantel, had sounded twice the <lb/> customary <hi
                        rend="italic">larum,</hi> but had not been heard by us. It was <lb/> now
                    struck a third time. It was <hi rend="italic">one.</hi> Our guest appeared <lb/>
                    somewhat startled at this signal, and looked, with a <reg orig="mourn-|ful"
                        >mournful</reg>
                    <lb/> sort of earnestness, at the clock. There was an air of <lb/> inquietude
                    about him, which I had never observed in an <lb/> equal degree before.</p>
                <p>I was not without much curiosity respecting other <reg orig="inci-|dents"
                        >incidents</reg>
                    <lb/> than those which had just been related by him; but <lb/> after so much
                    fatigue as he had undergone, I thought it <reg orig="im-|proper">improper</reg>
                    <lb/> to prolong the conversation.</p>
                <p>Come, said I, my friend, let us to bed. This is a drowsy <lb/> time, and after so
                    much exercise of mind and body, you <lb/> cannot but need some repose. Much has
                    happened in your <lb/> absence, which is proper to be known to you, but our <reg

                    <lb/> will be best deferred till tomorrow. I will come into <lb/> your chamber
                    by day-dawn, and unfold to you <reg orig="particu-|lars">particulars</reg>.</p>
                <pb n="111" entity="eaf033v2_0320" pid="uva-lib:349627"/>
                <p>Nay, said he, withdraw not on my account. If I go to <lb/> my chamber, it will
                    not be to sleep, but to meditate, <reg orig="espe-|cially">especially</reg>
                    <lb/> after your assurance that something of moment has <lb/> occurred in my
                    absence. My thoughts, independently of <lb/> any cause of sorrow or fear, have
                    received an impulse which <lb/> solitude and darkness will not stop. It is
                    impossible to <lb/> know too much for our safety and integrity, or to know it
                    too <lb/> soon. What has happened?</p>
                <p>I did not hesitate to comply with his request, for it was <lb/> not difficult to
                    conceive that, however tired the limbs might <lb/> be, the adventures of this
                    day would not be easily expelled <lb/> from the memory at night. I told him the
                    substance of the <lb/> conversation with Mrs. Althorpe. He smiled at those parts
                    <lb/> of the narrative which related to himself; but when his <lb/> father's
                    depravity and poverty were mentioned, he melted <lb/> into tears.</p>
                <p>Poor wretch! I that knew thee in thy better days, might <lb/> have easily divined
                    this consequence. I foresaw thy poverty <lb/> and degradation in the same hour
                    that I left thy roof. My <lb/> soul drooped at the prospect, but I said, it
                    cannot be <reg orig="pre-|vented">prevented</reg>, <lb/> and this reflection was
                    an antidote to grief, but now <lb/> that thy ruin is complete, it seems as if
                    some of it were <reg orig="im-|putable">imputable</reg>
                    <lb/> to me, who forsook thee when the succor and <reg orig="coun-|sel"
                        >counsel</reg>
                    <lb/> of a son were most needed. Thou art ignorant and <lb/> vicious, but thou
                    art my father still. I see that the <reg orig="suffer-|ings">sufferings</reg>
                    <lb/> of a better man than thou art would less afflict me than <lb/> thine.
                    Perhaps it is still in my power to restore thy liberty <lb/> and good name, and
                    yet&mdash;that is a fond wish. Thou <lb/> art past the age when the ignorance
                    and groveling habits of <lb/> a human being are susceptible of cure&mdash;There
                    he stopped, <lb/> and after a gloomy pause, continued:</p>
                <p>I am not surprised or afflicted at the misconceptions of <lb/> my neighbors, with
                    relation to my own character. Men <lb/> must judge from what they see; they must
                    build their <reg orig="con-|clusions">conclusions</reg>
                    <lb/> on their knowledge. I never saw in the rebukes <lb/> of my neighbors, any
                    thing but laudable abhorrence of vice. <lb/> They were too eager to blame, to
                    collect materials of <reg orig="cen-|sure">censure</reg>
                    <lb/> rather than of praise. It was not me whom they hated <lb/> and despised.
                    It was the phantom that passed under my <lb/> name, which existed only in their
                    imagination, and which <lb/> was worthy of all their scorn and all their
                    enmity.</p>
                <pb n="112" entity="eaf033v2_0321" pid="uva-lib:349628"/>
                <p>What I appeared to be in their eyes, was as much the <lb/> object of my own
                    disapprobation as of theirs. Their <reg orig="re-|proaches">reproaches</reg>
                    <lb/> only evinced the rectitude of their decisions, as <lb/> well as of my own.
                    I drew from them new motives to <lb/> complacency. They fortified my
                    perseverance in the path <lb/> which I had chosen as best; they raised me higher
                    in my <lb/> own esteem; they heightened the claims of the reproachers <lb/>
                    themselves to my respect and my gratitude.</p>
                <p>They thought me slothful, incurious, destitute of <reg orig="know-|ledge"
                        >knowledge</reg>, <lb/> and of all thirst of knowledge, insolent and <reg
                        orig="profli-|gate">profligate</reg>. <lb/> They say that in the treatment
                    of my father, I have <lb/> been ungrateful and inhuman. I have stolen his
                    property, <lb/> and deserted him in his calamity. Therefore they hate <lb/> and
                    revile me. It is well; I love them for these proofs of <lb/> their discernment
                    and integrity. Their indignation at wrong <lb/> is the truest test of their
                    virtue.</p>
                <p>It is true that they mistake me, but that arises from the <lb/> circumstances of
                    our mutual situation. They examined <lb/> what was exposed to their view; they
                    grasped at what was <lb/> placed within their reach. To decide contrary to <reg
                        orig="appear-|ances">appearances</reg>; <lb/> to judge from what they know
                    not, would prove <lb/> them to be brutish and not rational, would make their
                        <reg orig="de-|cision">decision</reg>
                    <lb/> of no worth, and render them, in their turn, objects <lb/> of neglect and
                    contempt.</p>
                <p>It is true that I hated school that I sought occasions of <lb/> absence, and
                    finally, on being struck by the master, <reg orig="deter-|mined"
                        >determined</reg>
                    <lb/> to enter his presence no more. I loved to leap, to <lb/> run, to swim, to
                    climb trees, and to clamber up rocks, to <lb/> shroud myself in thickets, and
                    stroll among woods, to obey <lb/> the impulse of the moment, and to prate or be
                    silent, just <lb/> as my humor prompted me. All this I loved more than to <lb/>
                    go to and fro in the same path, and at stated hours, to look <lb/> off and on a
                    book, to read just as much, and of such a <lb/> kind, to stand up and be seated,
                    just as another thought <lb/> proper to direct. I hated to be classed, cribbed,
                    rebuked <lb/> and feruled at the pleasure of one, who, as it seemed to <lb/> me,
                    knew no guide in his rewards but caprice, and no <lb/> prompter in his
                    punishments but passion.</p>
                <p>It is true that I took up the spade and the hoe as rarely, <lb/> and for as short
                    a time, as possible. I preferred to ramble <lb/> in the forest and loiter on the
                    hill; perpetually to change <lb/>
                    <pb n="113" entity="eaf033v2_0322" pid="uva-lib:349629"/> the scene; to
                    scrutinize the endless variety of objects; to <lb/> compare one leaf and pebble
                    with another; to pursue those <lb/> trains of thought which their resemblances
                    and differences <lb/> suggested; to inquire what it was that gave them this
                    place, <lb/> structure, and form, were more agreeable employments <lb/> than
                    ploughing and threshing.</p>
                <p>My father could well afford to hire labor. What my age <lb/> and my constitution
                    enabled me to do could be done by a <lb/> sturdy buy, in half the time, with
                    half the toil, and with <lb/> none of the reluctance. The boy was a bond
                    servant, and <lb/> the cost of his clothing and food was next to nothing. True
                    <lb/> it is, that my service would have saved him even this <reg
                        orig="ex-|pense">expense</reg>, <lb/> but my motives for declining the
                    effort were not <lb/> hastily weighed or superficially examined. These were my
                    <lb/> motives.</p>
                <p>My frame was delicate and feeble. Exposure to wet <lb/> blasts and vertical suns
                    was sure to make me sick. My <lb/> father was insensible to this consequence;
                    and no degree of <lb/> diligence would please him, but that which would destroy
                    <lb/> my health. My health was dearer to my mother than to <lb/> me. She was
                    more anxious to exempt me from possible <lb/> injuries than reason justified;
                    but anxious she was, and I <lb/> could not save her from anxiety, but by almost
                    wholly <reg orig="ab-|staining">abstaining</reg>
                    <lb/> from labor. I thought her peace of mind was of <lb/> some value, and that,
                    if the inclination of either of my <reg orig="pa-|rents">parents</reg>
                    <lb/> must be gratified at the expense of the other, the <reg
                        orig="pre-|ference">preference</reg>
                    <lb/> was due to the woman who bore me; who nursed <lb/> me in disease; who
                    watched over my safety with incessant <lb/> tenderness; whose life and whose
                    peace were involved in <lb/> mine. I should have deemed myself brutish and <reg
                        orig="obdu-|rately">obdurately</reg>
                    <lb/> wicked to have loaded her with fears and cares <lb/> merely to smooth the
                    brow of a froward old man, whose <lb/> avarice called on me to sacrifice my case
                    and my health, <lb/> and who shifted to other shoulders the province of <reg
                        orig="sustain-|ing">sustaining</reg>
                    <lb/> me when sick, and of mourning for me when dead.</p>
                <p>I likewise believed, that it became me to reflect upon <lb/> the influence of my
                    decision on my own happiness; and <lb/> to weigh the profits flowing to my
                    father from my labor, <lb/> against the benefits of mental exercise, the
                    pleasures of the <lb/> woods and streams, healthful sensations, and the luxury
                    of <lb/> musing. The pecuniary profit was petty and contemptible, <lb/>
                    <pb n="114" entity="eaf033v2_0323" pid="uva-lib:349630"/> It obviated no
                    necessity. It purchased no rational <reg orig="enjoy-|ment">enjoyment</reg>.
                    <lb/> It merely provoked, by furnishing the means of <reg orig="in-|dulgence"
                        >indulgence</reg>, <lb/> an appetite from which my father was not <reg
                        orig="ex-|empt">exempt</reg>. <lb/> It cherished the seeds of depravity in
                    him, and <lb/> lessened the little stock of happiness belonging to my <lb/>
                    mother.</p>
                <p>I did not detain you long, my friends, in portraying my <lb/> parents, and
                    recounting domestic incidents, when I first <lb/> told you my story. What had no
                    connexion with the <reg orig="his-|tory">history</reg>
                    <lb/> of Welbeck and with the part that I have acted upon <lb/> this stage, I
                    thought it proper to omit. My omission was <lb/> likewise prompted by other
                    reasons. My mind is <reg orig="ener-|vated">enervated</reg>
                    <lb/> and feeble like my body. I cannot look upon the <lb/> sufferings of those
                    I love without exquisite pain. I cannot <lb/> steel my heart by the force of
                    reason, and by submission to <lb/> necessity; and, therefore, too frequently
                    employ the <reg orig="cow-|ardly">cowardly</reg>
                    <lb/> expedient of endeavoring to forget what I cannot <reg orig="re-|member"
                        >remember</reg>
                    <lb/> without agony.</p>
                <p>I told you that my father was sober and industrious by <lb/> habit, but habit is
                    not uniform. There were intervals when <lb/> his plodding and tame spirit gave
                    place to the malice and <lb/> fury of a demon. Liquors were not sought by him,
                    but he <lb/> could not withstand entreaty, and a potion that produced no <lb/>
                    effect upon others changed him into a maniac.</p>
                <p>I told you that I had a sister, whom the arts of a villain <lb/> destroyed. Alas!
                    the work of her destruction was left <reg orig="un-|finished">unfinished</reg>
                    <lb/> by him. The blows and contumelies of a <reg orig="mis-|judging"
                        >misjudging</reg>
                    <lb/> and implacable parent, who scrupled not to thrust <lb/> her, with her
                    new-born infant, out of doors; the curses and <lb/> taunts of unnatural brothers
                    left her no alternative but death <lb/> &mdash;&mdash;But I must not think of
                    this; I must not think of the <lb/> wrongs which my mother endured in the person
                    of her <lb/> only and darling daughter.</p>
                <p>My brothers were the copyists of the father, whom they <lb/> resembled in temper
                    and person. My mother doated on <lb/> her own image in her daughter and in me.
                    This daughter <lb/> was ravished from her by self-violence, and her other <reg
                        orig="child-|ren">children</reg>
                    <lb/> by disease. I only remained to appropriate her <reg orig="affec-|tions"
                        >affections</reg>
                    <lb/> and fulfil her hopes. This alone had furnished a <lb/> sufficient reason
                    why I should be careful of my health and <lb/>
                    <pb n="115" entity="eaf033v2_0324" pid="uva-lib:349631"/> my life, but my
                    father's character supplied me with a motive <lb/> infinitely more cogent.</p>
                <p>It is almost incredible, but, nevertheless, true, that the <lb/> only being whose
                    presence, and remonstrances had any <lb/> influence on my father, at moments
                    when his reason was <lb/> extinct, was myself. As to my personal strength, it
                    was <lb/> nothing; yet my mother's person was rescued from brutal <lb/>
                    violence; he was checked, in the midst of his ferocious <lb/> career, by a
                    single look or exclamation from me. The <lb/> fear of my rebukes had even some
                    influence in enabling him <lb/> to resist temptation. If I entered the tavern,
                    at the moment <lb/> when he was lifting the glass to his lips, I never weighed
                    the <lb/> injunctions of decorum, but, snatching the vessel from his <lb/> hand,
                    I threw it on the ground. I was not deterred by the <lb/> presence of others;
                    and their censures on my want of filial <lb/> respect and duty, were listened to
                    with unconcern. I chose <lb/> not to justify myself by expatiating on domestic
                    miseries, <lb/> and by calling down that pity on my mother, which I knew <lb/>
                    would only have increased her distress.</p>
                <p>The world regarded my deportment as insolent and <reg orig="per-|verse"
                        >perverse</reg>
                    <lb/> to a degree of insanity. To deny my father an <reg orig="in-|dulgence"
                        >indulgence</reg>
                    <lb/> which they thought harmless, and which, indeed, <lb/> was harmless in its
                    influence on other men; to interfere thus <lb/> publicly with his social
                    enjoyments, and expose him to <reg orig="mor-|tification">mortification</reg>
                    <lb/> and shame, was loudly condemned; but my duty <lb/> to my mother debarred
                    me from eluding this censure on the <lb/> only terms on which it could have been
                    eluded. Now it has <lb/> ceased to be necessary to conceal what passed in
                    domestic <lb/> retirements, and I should willingly confess the truth before
                    <lb/> any audience.</p>
                <p>At first my father imagined, that threats and blows would <lb/> intimidate his
                    monitor. In this he was mistaken, and the <lb/> detection of this mistake
                    impressed him with an involuntary <lb/> reverence for me, which set bounds to
                    those excesses which <lb/> disdained any other control. Hence, I derived new
                        <reg orig="mo-|tives">motives</reg>
                    <lb/> for cherishing a life which was useful, in so many ways, <lb/> to my
                    mother.</p>
                <p>My condition is now changed. I am no longer on that <lb/> field to which the law,
                    as well as reason, must acknowledge <lb/> that I had some right, while there was
                    any in my father. I <lb/> must hazard my life, if need be, in the pursuit of the
                    means <lb/>
                    <pb n="116" entity="eaf033v2_0325" pid="uva-lib:349632"/> of honest subsistence.
                    I never spared myself while in the <lb/> service of Mr. Hadwin; and, at a more
                    inclement season, <lb/> should probably have incurred some hazard by my
                    diligence.</p>
                <p>These were the motives of my <hi rend="italic">idleness</hi>&mdash;for, my <reg
                        orig="abstain-|ing">abstaining</reg>
                    <lb/> from the common toils of the farm passed by that name <lb/> among my
                    neighbors; though, in truth, my time was far <lb/> from being wholly unoccupied
                    by manual employments, but <lb/> these required less exertion of body or mind,
                    or were more <lb/> connected with intellectual efforts. They were pursued in
                    <lb/> the seclusion of my chamber or the recesses of a wood. <lb/> I did not
                    labor to conceal them, but neither was I anxious to <lb/> attract notice. It was
                    sufficient that the censure of my <lb/> neighbors was unmerited, to make me
                    regard it with <reg orig="indiffer-|ence">indifference</reg>.</p>
                <p>I sought not the society of persons of my own age, not <lb/> from sullen or
                    unsociable habits, but merely because those <lb/> around me were totally unlike
                    myself. Their tastes and <lb/> occupations were incompatible with mine. In my
                    few books, <lb/> in my pen, in the vegetable and animal existences around <lb/>
                    me, I found companions who adapted their visits and <reg orig="inter-|course"
                        >intercourse</reg>
                    <lb/> to my convenience and caprice, and with whom I <lb/> was never tired of
                    communing.</p>
                <p>I was not unaware of the opinion which my neighbors had <lb/> formed of my being
                    improperly connected with Betty <reg orig="Law-|rence">Lawrence</reg>. <lb/> I
                    am not sorry that I fell into company with that <lb/> girl. Her intercourse has
                    instructed me in what some would <lb/> think impossible to be attained by one
                    who had never <reg orig="haunt-|ed">haunted</reg>
                    <lb/> the impure recesses of licentiousness in a city. The <lb/> knowledge,
                    which a residence in this town for ten years gave <lb/> her audacious and
                    inquisitive spirit, she imparted to me. <lb/> Her character, profligate and
                    artful, libidinous and impudent, <lb/> and made up of the impressions which a
                    city life had <reg orig="pro-|duced">produced</reg>
                    <lb/> on her coarse but active mind, was open to my study, <lb/> and I studied
                    it.</p>
                <p>I scarcely know how to repel the charge of illicit conduct, <lb/> and to depict
                    the exact species of intercourse subsisting <reg orig="be-|tween">between</reg>
                    <lb/> us. I always treated her with freedom, and <reg orig="some-|times"
                        >sometimes</reg>
                    <lb/> with gaiety. I had no motives to reserve. I was so <lb/> formed that a
                    creature like her had no power over my <lb/> senses. That species of temptation
                    adapted to entice me <lb/> from the true path, was widely different from the
                    artifices of <lb/>
                    <pb n="117" entity="eaf033v2_0326" pid="uva-lib:349633">

                    </pb> Betty. There was no point at which it was possible for her <lb/> to get
                    possession of my fancy. I watched her while she <lb/> practised all her tricks
                    and blandishments, just as I regarded <lb/> a similar deportment in the <hi
                        rend="italic">animal salax ignavumque</hi> who <lb/> inhabits the stye. I
                    made efforts to pursue my observations <lb/> unembarrassed; but my efforts were
                    made, not to restrain <lb/> desire, but to suppress disgust. The difficulty lay,
                    not in <lb/> withholding my caresses, but in forbearing to repulse her <lb/>
                    with rage.</p>
                <p>Decorum, indeed, was not outraged, and all limits were <lb/> not overstept at
                    once. Dubious advances were employed; <lb/> but, when found unavailing, were
                    displaced by more <reg orig="shame-|less">shameless</reg>
                    <lb/> and direct proceedings. She was too little versed in <lb/> human nature to
                    see that her last expedient was always <lb/> worse than the preceding; and that,
                    in proportion as she <lb/> lost sight of decency, she multiplied the obstacles
                    to her <lb/> success.</p>
                <p>Betty had many enticements in person and air. She was <lb/> ruddy, smooth, and
                    plump. To these she added&mdash;I must <lb/> not say what, for it is strange to
                    what lengths a woman <reg orig="desti-|tute">destitute</reg>
                    <lb/> of modesty will sometimes go. But all her artifices <lb/> availing her not
                    at all in the contest with my insensibilities, <lb/> she resorted to extremes,
                    which it would serve no good <reg orig="pur-|pose">purpose</reg>
                    <lb/> to describe in this audience. They produced not the <lb/> consequences she
                    wished, but they produced another which <lb/> was by no means displeasing to
                    her. An incident one night <lb/> occurred, from which a sagacious observer
                    deduced the <reg orig="ex-|istence">existence</reg>
                    <lb/> of an intrigue. It was useless to attempt to rectify his <lb/> mistake, by
                    explaining appearances, in a manner consistent <lb/> with my innocence. This
                    mode of explication implied a <lb/> continence in me which he denied to be
                    possible. The <reg orig="stand-|ard">standard</reg>
                    <lb/> of possibilities, especially in vice and virtue, is fashioned by <lb/>
                    most men after their own character. A temptation which this <lb/> judge of human
                    nature knew that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> was unable to resist, he <lb/> sagely
                    concluded to be irresistible by any other man, and <lb/> quickly established the
                    belief among my neighbors, that the <lb/> woman who married the father had been
                    prostituted to the <lb/> son. Though I never admitted the truth of this
                    aspersion, <lb/> I believed it useless to deny, because no one would credit
                    <lb/> my denial, and because I had no power to disprove it.</p>

                <p><hi rend="small-caps">What</hi> other inquiries were to be resolved by our young
                    <lb/> friend, we were now, at this late hour, obliged to postpone <lb/> till the
                    morrow. I shall pass over the reflections which a <lb/> story like this would
                    naturally suggest, and hasten to our <lb/> next interview.</p>
                <p>After breakfast next morning, the subject of last night's <lb/> conversation was
                    renewed. I told him that something <lb/> had occurred in his absence, in
                    relation to Mrs. <reg orig="Went-|worth">Wentworth</reg>
                    <lb/> and her nephew, that had perplexed us not a little. <lb/> My information
                    is obtained, continued I, from Wortley; and <lb/> it is nothing less, than that
                    young Clavering, Mrs. <reg orig="Went-|worth's">Wentworth's</reg>
                    <lb/> nephew, is, at this time, actually alive.</p>
                <p>Surprise, but none of the embarrassment of guilt, <reg orig="appear-|ed"
                        >appeared</reg>
                    <lb/> in his countenance at these tidings. He looked at me <lb/> as if desirous
                    that I should proceed.</p>
                <p>It seems, added I, that a letter was lately received by <lb/> this lady from the
                    father of Clavering, who is now in Europe. <lb/> This letter reports that this
                    son was lately met with in <lb/> Charleston and relates the means which old Mr.
                    Clavering <lb/> had used to prevail upon his son to return home; means, of <lb/>
                    the success of which he entertained well grounded hopes. <lb/> What think
                    you?</p>
                <p>I can only reject it, said he, after some pause, as untrue. <lb/> The father's
                    correspondent may have been deceived. The <lb/> father may have been deceived,
                    or the father may conceive <lb/> it necessary to deceive the aunt, or some other
                    supposition as <lb/> to the source of the error, may be true; but an error it
                    surely <lb/> is. Clavering is not alive. I know the chamber where he <lb/> died,
                    and the withered pine under which he lies buried.</p>
                <p>If she be deceived, said I, it will be impossible to rectify <lb/> her error.</p>
                <p>I hope not. An honest front and a straight story will be <lb/> sufficient.</p>
                <p>How do you mean to act?</p>
                <p>Visit her without doubt, and tell her the truth. My <lb/> tale will be too
                    circumstantial and consistent to permit her <lb/> to disbelieve.</p>
                <pb n="119" entity="eaf033v2_0328" pid="uva-lib:349635"/>
                <p>She will not hearken to you. She is too strongly <reg orig="prepos-|sessed"
                        >prepossessed</reg>
                    <lb/> against you to admit you even to a hearing.</p>
                <p>She cannot help it. Unless she lock her door against <lb/> me, or stuff her ears
                    with wool, she must hear me. Her <lb/> prepossessions are reasonable, but are
                    easily removed by <lb/> telling the truth. Why does she suspect me of artifice?
                    <lb/> Because I seemed to be allied to Welbeck, and because I <lb/> disguised
                    the truth. That she thinks ill of me is not her <lb/> fault, but my misfortune;
                    and, happily for me, a misfortune <lb/> easily removed.</p>
                <p>Then you will try to see her.</p>
                <p>I will see her, and the sooner the better. I will see her <lb/> to day; this
                    morning; as soon as I have seen Welbeck, <lb/> whom I shall immediately visit in
                    his prison.</p>
                <p>There are other embarrassments and dangers of which you <lb/> not aware. Welbeck
                    is pursued by many persons whom <lb/> he has defrauded of large sums. By these
                    persons you <lb/> are deemed an accomplice in his guilt, and a warrant is <lb/>
                    already in the hands of officers for arresting you wherever <lb/> you are
                    found.</p>
                <p>In what way, said Mervyn, sedately, do they imagine me <lb/> a partaker of his
                    crime?</p>
                <p>I know not. You lived with him. You fled with him. <lb/> You aided and connived
                    at his escape.</p>
                <p>Are these crimes?</p>
                <p>I believe not, but they subject you to suspicion.</p>
                <p>To arrest and to punishment?</p>
                <p>To detention for a while, perhaps. But these alone <reg orig="can-|not"
                        >cannot</reg>
                    <lb/> expose you to punishment.</p>
                <p>I thought so. Then I have nothing to fear.</p>
                <p>You have imprisonment and obloquy, at least, to dread.</p>
                <p>True; but they cannot be avoided but by my exile and <lb/> skulking out of
                    sight&mdash;evils infinitely more formidable. I <lb/> shall, therefore, not
                    avoid them. The sooner my conduct <lb/> is subjected to scrutiny, the better.
                    Will you go with me to <lb/> Welbeck?</p>
                <p>I will go with you.</p>
                <p>Inquiring for Welbeck of the keeper of the prison, we <lb/> were informed that he
                    was in his own apartment very sick. <lb/> The physician, attending the prison,
                    had been called, but <lb/> the prisoner had preserved an obstinate and scornful
                    silence; <lb/>
                    <pb n="120" entity="eaf033v2_0329" pid="uva-lib:349636"/> and had neither
                    explained his condition, nor consented to <lb/> accept any aid.</p>
                <p>We now went alone into his apartment. His sensibility <lb/> seemed fast ebbing,
                    yet an emotion of joy was visible in his <lb/> eyes at the appearance of Mervyn.
                    He seemed likewise <lb/> to recognise in me his late visitant, and made no
                    objection <lb/> to my entrance.</p>
                <p>How are you this morning? said Arthur, seating <reg orig="him-|self"
                        >himself</reg>
                    <lb/> on the bed-side, and taking his hand. The sick man <lb/> was scarcely able
                    to articulate his reply&mdash;I shall soon be <lb/> well. I have longed to see
                    you. I want to leave with you <lb/> a few words. He now cast his languid eyes on
                    me. <lb/> You are his friend, he continued. You know all. You <lb/> may
                    stay.&mdash;</p>
                <p>There now succeeded a long pause, during which he <lb/> closed his eyes, and
                    resigned himself as if to an oblivion <lb/> of all thought. His pulse under my
                    hand was scarcely <reg orig="per-|ceptible">perceptible</reg>. <lb/> From this
                    in some minutes he recovered, and <lb/> fixing his eyes on Mervyn, resumed, in a
                    broken and feeble <lb/> accent:</p>
                <p>Clemenza! You have seen her. Weeks ago, I left her <lb/> in an accursed house;
                    yet she has not been mistreated. <lb/> Neglected and abandoned indeed, but not
                    mistreated. Save <lb/> her Mervyn. Comfort her. Awaken charity for her sake.</p>
                <p>I cannot tell you what has happened. The tale would be <lb/> too long&mdash;too
                    mournful. Yet, in justice to the living, I <lb/> must tell you something. My
                    woes and my crimes will be <lb/> buried with me. Some of them, but not all.</p>
                <p>Ere this, I should have been many leagues upon the <lb/> ocean, had not a
                    newspaper fallen into my hands while on <lb/> the eve of embarkation. By that I
                    learned that a treasure <lb/> was buried with the remains of the ill-fated
                    Watson. I was <lb/> destitute. I was unjust enough to wish to make this <reg
                        orig="trea-|sure">treasure</reg>
                    <lb/> my own. Prone to think I was forgotten, or numbered <lb/> with the victims
                    of pestilence, I ventured to return under a <lb/> careless disguise. I
                    penetrated to the vaults of that deserted <lb/> dwelling by night. I dug up the
                    bones of my friend, and <lb/> found the girdle and its valuable contents,
                    according to the <lb/> accurate description that I had read.</p>
                <p>I hastened back with my prize to Baltimore, but my evil <lb/> destiny overtook me
                    at last. I was recognised by <reg orig="emissa-|ries">emissaries</reg>

                    consummate my fate and defeat the rage of my creditors <lb/> by death. But
                    first&mdash;</p>
                <p>Here Welbeck stretched out his left hand to Mervyn, and, <lb/> after some
                    reluctance, shewed a roll of lead.</p>
                <p>Receive this, said he. In the use of it, be guided by <lb/> your honesty and by
                    the same advertisement that furnished <lb/> me the clue by which to recover it.
                    That being secured, <lb/> the world and I will part forever. Withdraw, for your
                        <reg orig="pre-|sence">presence</reg>
                    <lb/> can help me nothing.</p>
                <p>We were unwilling to comply with his injunction, and <lb/> continued some longer
                    time in his chamber, but our kind <reg orig="in-|tent">intent</reg>
                    <lb/> availed nothing. He quickly relapsed into insensibility, <lb/> from which
                    he recovered not again, but next day expired. <lb/> Such, in the flower of his
                    age, was the fate of Thomas <lb/> Welbeck.</p>
                <p>Whatever interest I might feel in accompanying the <reg orig="pro-|gress"

                        >emergency</reg>
                    <lb/> compelled me again to leave the city. A kinsman, <lb/> to whom I was bound
                    by many obligations, was suffering a <lb/> lingering disease, and imagining,
                    with some reason, his <reg orig="dis-|solution">dissolution</reg>
                    <lb/> to he not far distant, he besought my company and <lb/> my assistance, to
                    sooth, at least, the agonies of his last hour. <lb/> I was anxious to clear up
                    the mysteries which Arthur's <reg orig="con-|duct">conduct</reg>
                    <lb/> had produced, and to shield him, if possible, from the <lb/> evils which I
                    feared awaited him. It was impossible, <reg orig="how-|ever">however</reg>,
                    <lb/> to decline the invitation of my kinsman, as his <reg orig="resi-|dence"
                        >residence</reg>
                    <lb/> was not a day's journey from the city. I was <reg orig="obli-|ged"
                        >obliged</reg>
                    <lb/> to content myself with occasional information, imparted <lb/> by Mervyn's
                    letters, or those of my wife.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, on leaving the prison, I hasted to inform <reg orig="Mer-|vyn"
                        >Mervyn</reg>
                    <lb/> of the true nature of the scene which had just passed. <lb/> By this
                    extraordinary occurrence, the property of the <reg orig="Mau-|rices"
                        >Maurices</reg>
                    <lb/> was now in honest hands. Welbeck, stimulated by <lb/> selfish motives, had
                    done that which any other person would <lb/> have found encompassed with
                    formidable dangers and <reg orig="diffi-|culties">difficulties</reg>. <lb/> How
                    this attempt was suggested or executed, he <lb/> had not informed us, nor was it
                    desirable to know. It was <lb/> sufficient that the means of restoring their own
                    to a destitute <lb/> and meritorious family, were now in our possession.</p>

                <p>Having returned home, I unfolded to Mervyn all the <reg orig="par-|ticulars"
                        >particulars</reg>
                    <lb/> respecting Williams and the Maurices, which I had <lb/> lately learned
                    from Wortley. He listened with deep <reg orig="atten-|tion">attention</reg>,
                    <lb/> and my story being finished, he said; in this small <lb/> compass, then,
                    is the patrimony and subsistence of a <reg orig="nume-|rous">numerous</reg>
                    <lb/> family. To restore it to them is the obvious <reg
                        orig="proceed-|ing&mdash;but">proceeding&mdash;but</reg>
                    <lb/> how? Where do they abide?</p>
                <p>Williams and Watson's wife live in Baltimore, and the <lb/> Maurices live near
                    that town. The advertisements alluded <lb/> to by Wortley, and which are to be
                    found in any <reg orig="newspa-|per">newspaper</reg>, <lb/> will inform us; but
                    first, are we sure that any or all of <lb/> these bills are contained in this
                    covering?</p>
                <p>The lead was now unrolled, and the bills which Williams <lb/> had described, were
                    found enclosed. Nothing appeared to <lb/> be deficient. Of this, however, we
                    were scarcely qualified <lb/> to judge. Those that were the property of Williams
                    might <lb/> not be entire, and what would be the consequence of <reg
                        orig="present-|ing">presenting</reg>
                    <lb/> them to him, if any had been embezzled by Welbeck?</p>
                <p>This difficulty was obviated by Mervyn, who observed <lb/> that the
                    advertisement, describing these bills, would afford <lb/> us ample information
                    on this head. Having found out <lb/> where the Maurices and Mrs. Watson live,
                    nothing remains <lb/> but to visit them, and put an end, as far as lies in my
                    power, <lb/> to their inquietudes.</p>
                <p>What! Would you go to Baltimore?</p>
                <p>Certainly. Can any other expedient be proper? How <lb/> shall I otherwise insure
                    the safe conveyance of these <reg orig="pa-|pers">papers</reg>?</p>
                <p>You may send them by post.</p>
                <p>But why not go myself?</p>
                <p>I can hardly tell, unless your appearance on such an <reg orig="er-|rand"
                        >errand</reg>, <lb/> may be suspected likely to involve you in <reg

                <p>What embarrassments? If they receive their own, ought <lb/> they not to be
                    satisfied?</p>
                <p>The inquiry will naturally be made as to the manner of <lb/> gaining possession
                    of these papers. They were lately in <lb/> the hands of Watson, but Watson has
                    disappeared. <reg orig="Suspi-|cions">Suspicions</reg>
                    <lb/> are awake respecting the cause of his disappearance. <lb/> These
                    suspicions are connected with Welbeck, and <reg orig="Wel-|beck's"
                        >Welbeck's</reg>

                <p>These are evils, but I see not how an ingenuous and open <lb/> conduct is adapted
                    to increase these evils. If they come, I <lb/> must endure them.</p>
                <p>I believe your decision is right. No one is so skilful an <lb/> advocate in a
                    cause, as he whose cause it is. I rely upon <lb/> your skill and address, and
                    shall leave you to pursue your <lb/> own way. I must leave you for a time, but
                    shall expect to <lb/> be punctually informed of all that passes. With this <reg

                    upon <lb/> its journey. What remains of my story may be despatched <lb/> in a
                    trice. I have just now some vacant hours, which <lb/> might possibly be more
                    usefully employed, but not in an <lb/> easier manner or more pleasant. So, let
                    me carry on thy <lb/> thread.</p>
                <p>First, let me mention the resolutions I had formed at the <lb/> time I parted
                    with my friend. I had several objects in <lb/> view. One was a conference with
                    Mrs. Wentworth; <reg orig="an-|other">another</reg>
                    <lb/> was an interview with her whom I met with at <lb/> Villars's. My heart
                    melted when I thought upon the <reg orig="deso-|late">desolate</reg>
                    <lb/> condition of Clemenza, and determined me to direct my <lb/> first efforts
                    for her relief. For this end I was to visit the <lb/> female who had given me a
                    direction to her house. The <lb/> name of this person is Achsa Fielding, and she
                    lived, <reg orig="ac-|cording">according</reg>
                    <lb/> to her own direction, at No. 40, Walnut-street.</p>
                <p>I went thither without delay. She was not at home. <lb/> Having gained
                    information from the servant, as to when she <lb/> might be found, I proceeded
                    to Mrs. Wentworth's. In <lb/> going thither my mind was deeply occupied in
                    meditation; <lb/> and, with my usual carelessness of forms, I entered the <lb/>
                    house and made my way to the parlor, where an interview <lb/> had formerly taken
                    place between us.</p>
                <p>Having arrived, I began, though somewhat unseasonably, <lb/> to reflect upon the
                    topics with which I should introduce my <lb/>
                    <pb n="124" entity="eaf033v2_0333" pid="uva-lib:349640"/> conversation, and
                    particularly the manner in which I should <lb/> introduce myself. I had opened
                    doors without warning, <lb/> and traversed passages without being noticed. This
                    had <lb/> arisen from my thoughtlessness. There was no one within <lb/> hearing
                    or sight. What was next to be done? Should I <lb/> not return softly to the
                    outer door, and summon the servant <lb/> by knocking?</p>
                <p>Preparing to do this, I heard a footstep in the entry <lb/> which suspended my
                    design. I stood in the middle of the <lb/> floor, attentive to these movements,
                    when presently the door <lb/> opened, and there entered the apartment Mrs.
                    Wentworth <lb/> herself! She came, as it seemed, without expectation of <lb/>
                    finding any one there. When, therefore, the figure of a <lb/> man caught her
                    vagrant attention, she started and cast a <lb/> hasty look towards me.</p>
                <p>Pray! (in a peremptory tone) how came you here, sir? <lb/> and what is your
                    business?</p>
                <p>Neither arrogance, on the one hand; nor humility, upon <lb/> the other, had any
                    part in modelling my deportment. I <lb/> came not to deprecate anger, or exult
                    over distress. I <reg orig="an-|swered">answered</reg>, <lb/> therefore,
                    distinctly, firmly, and erectly.</p>
                <p>I came to see you, madam, and converse with you; but, <lb/> being busy with other
                    thoughts, I forgot to knock at the <lb/> door. No evil was intended by my
                    negligence, though <reg orig="pro-|priety">propriety</reg>
                    <lb/> has certainly not been observed. Will you pardon <lb/> this intrusion, and
                    condescend to grant me your attention?</p>
                <p>To what? What have you to say to me? I know you <lb/> only as the accomplice of a
                    villain in an attempt to deceive <lb/> me. There is nothing to justify your
                    coming hither, and I <lb/> desire you to leave the house with as little ceremony
                    as you <lb/> entered it.</p>
                <p>My eyes were lowered at this rebuke, yet I did not obey <lb/> the command. Your
                    treatment of me, madam, is such as <lb/> I appear to you to deserve. Appearances
                    are unfavorable <lb/> to me, but those appearances are false. I have concurred
                    <lb/> in no plot against your reputation or your fortune. I have <lb/> told you
                    nothing but the truth. I came hither to promote <lb/> no selfish or sinister
                    purpose. I have no favor to entreat, <lb/> and no petition to offer, but that
                    you will suffer me to clear <lb/> up those mistakes which you have harbored
                    respecting me.</p>
                <p>I am poor. I am destitute of fame and of kindred. I <lb/>
                    <pb n="125" entity="eaf033v2_0334" pid="uva-lib:349641"/> have nothing to
                    console me in obscurity and indigence, <lb/> but the approbation of my own heart
                    and the good opinion <lb/> of those who know me as I am. The good may be led
                    <lb/> to despise and condemn me. Their aversion and scorn <lb/> shall not make
                    me unhappy; but it is my interest and my <lb/> duty to rectify their error if I
                    can. I regard your <reg orig="charac-|ter">character</reg>
                    <lb/> with esteem. You have been mistaken in condemning <lb/> me as a liar and
                    impostor, and I came to remove this <reg orig="mis-|take">mistake</reg>. <lb/> I
                    came, if not to procure your esteem, at least, to <lb/> take away hatred and
                    suspicion.</p>
                <p>But this is not all my purpose. You are in an error in <lb/> relation not only to
                    my character, but to the situation of <lb/> your nephew Clavering. I formerly
                    told you, that I saw him <lb/> die; that I assisted at his burial; but my tale
                    was <reg orig="incohe-|rent">incoherent</reg>
                    <lb/> and imperfect, and you have since received intelligence <lb/> to which you
                    think proper to trust, and which assures you <lb/> that he is still living. All
                    I now ask is your attention, while <lb/> I relate the particulars of my
                    knowledge.</p>
                <p>Proof of my veracity or innocence may be of no value <lb/> in your eyes, but the
                    fate of your nephew ought to be <lb/> known to you. Certainty, on this head, may
                    be of much <lb/> importance to your happiness, and to the regulation of <lb/>
                    your future conduct. To hear me patiently can do you no <lb/> injury, and may
                    benefit you much. Will you permit me <lb/> to go on?</p>
                <p>During this address, little abatement of resentment and <lb/> scorn was visible
                    in my companion.</p>
                <p>I will hear you, she replied. Your invention may amuse <lb/> if it does not
                    edify. But, I pray you, let your story be <lb/> short.</p>
                <p>I was obliged to be content with this ungraceful <reg orig="conces-|sion"
                        >concession</reg>, <lb/> and proceeded to begin my narration. I described
                    <lb/> the situation of my father's dwelling. I mentioned the <lb/> year, month,
                    day, and hour, of her nephew's appearance <lb/> among us. I expatiated minutely
                    on his form, features, <lb/> dress, sound of his voice, and repeated his words.
                    His <lb/> favorite gestures and attitudes were faithfully described.</p>
                <p>I had gone but a little way in my story, when the effects <lb/> were visible in
                    her demeanor which I expected from it. <lb/> Her knowledge of the youth, and of
                    the time and manner <lb/> of his disappearance, made it impossible for me, with
                    so <lb/>
                    <pb n="126" entity="eaf033v2_0335" pid="uva-lib:349642"/> minute a narrative, to
                    impose upon her credulity. Every <lb/> word, every incident related, attested my
                    truth, by their <lb/> agreement with what she herself previously knew.</p>
                <p>Her suspicions and angry watchfulness was quickly <reg orig="ex-|changed"
                        >exchanged</reg>
                    <lb/> for downcast looks, and stealing tears, and sighs <lb/> difficulty
                    repressed. Meanwhile, I did not pause, but <reg orig="de-|scribed"
                        >described</reg>
                    <lb/> the treatment he received from my mother's <reg orig="tender-|ness"
                        >tenderness</reg>, <lb/> his occupations, the freaks of his insanity, and,
                    finally, <lb/> the circumstances of his death and funeral.</p>
                <p>Thence I hastened to the circumstances which brought <lb/> me to the city; which
                    placed me in the service of Welbeck, <lb/> and obliged me to perform so
                    ambiguous a part in her <reg orig="pre-|sence">presence</reg>. <lb/> I left no
                    difficulty to be solved, and no question <lb/> unanticipated.</p>
                <p>I have now finished my story, I continued, and <reg orig="accom-|plished"
                        >accomplished</reg>
                    <lb/> my design in coming hither. Whether I have <reg orig="vin-|dicated"
                        >vindicated</reg>
                    <lb/> my integrity from your suspicions, I know not. I <lb/> have done what in
                    me lay to remove your error; and, in <lb/> that, have done my duty. What more
                    remains? Any <reg orig="in-|quiries">inquiries</reg>
                    <lb/> you are pleased to make, I am ready to answer. If <lb/> there he none to
                    make, I will comply with your former <lb/> commands, and leave the house with as
                    little ceremony as I <lb/> entered it.</p>
                <p>Your story, she replied, has been unexpected. I believe <lb/> it fully, and am
                    sorry for the hard thoughts which past <reg orig="ap-|pearances"
                        >appearances</reg>
                    <lb/> have made me entertain concerning you.</p>
                <p>Here she sunk into mournful silence. The information, <lb/> she at length
                    resumed, which I have received from another <lb/> quarter respecting that
                    unfortunate youth, astonishes and <lb/> perplexes me. It is inconsistent with
                    your story, but it must <lb/> be founded on some mistake, which I am, at
                    present, unable <lb/> to unravel. Welbeck, whose connexion has been so <reg
                        orig="unfor-|tunate">unfortunate</reg>
                    <lb/> to you&mdash;</p>
                <p>Unfortunate! Dear Madam! How unfortunate? It has <lb/> done away a part of my
                    ignorance of the world in which <lb/> I live. It has led me to the situation in
                    which I am now <lb/> placed. It has introduced me to the knowledge of many <lb/>
                    good people. It has made me the witness, and the subject <lb/> of many acts of
                    beneficence and generosity. My <reg orig="know-|ledge">knowledge</reg>
                    <lb/> of Welbeck has been useful to me. It has enabled <lb/> me to he useful to
                    others. I look back upon that allotment <lb/>
                    <pb n="127" entity="eaf033v2_0336" pid="uva-lib:349643"/> of my destiny which
                    first led me to his door, with gratitude <lb/> and pleasure.</p>
                <p>Would to Heaven, continued I, somewhat changing my <lb/> tone, intercourse with
                    Welbeck had been as harmless to all <lb/> others as it has been to me; that no
                    injury to fortune and <lb/> fame, and innocence and life, had been incurred by
                    others <lb/> greater than has fallen upon my head. There is one being, <lb/>
                    whose connexion with him has not been utterly dissimilar in <lb/> its origin and
                    circumstances to mine, though the catastrophe <lb/> has, indeed, been widely and
                    mournfully different.</p>
                <p>And yet, within this moment, a thought has occurred <lb/> from which I derive
                    some consolation and some hope. You, <lb/> dear madam, are rich. These spacious
                    apartments, this <lb/> plentiful accommodation are yours. You have enough for
                    <lb/> your own gratification and convenience, and somewhat to <lb/> spare. Will
                    you take to your protecting arms, to your <reg orig="hos-|pitable"
                        >hospitable</reg>
                    <lb/> roof, an unhappy girl whom the arts of Welbeck <lb/> have robbed of
                    fortune, reputation, and honor, who is now <lb/> languishing in poverty, weeping
                    over the lifeless remains of <lb/> her babe, surrounded by the agents of vice,
                    and trembling <lb/> on the verge of infamy?</p>
                <p>What can this mean? replied the lady. Of whom do <lb/> you speak?</p>
                <p>You shall know her. You shall be apprized of her <lb/> claims to your compassion.
                    Her story, as far as is known <lb/> to me, I will faithfully repeat to you. She
                    is a stranger; <lb/> an Italian; her name is Clemenza Lodi.&mdash;</p>
                <p>Clemenza Lodi! Good Heaven! exclaimed Mrs. <reg orig="Went-|worth"
                        >Wentworth</reg>; <lb/> why, surely&mdash;it cannot be. And yet&mdash;is it
                    possible <lb/> that you are that person?</p>
                <p>I do not comprehend you, madam.</p>
                <p>A friend has related a transaction of a strange sort. It <lb/> is scarcely an
                    hour since she told it me. The name of <lb/> Clemenza Lodi was mentioned in it,
                    and a young man of <lb/> most singular deportment was described. But tell me how
                    <lb/> you were engaged on Thursday morning?</p>
                <p>I was coming to this city from a distance. I stopped ten <lb/> minutes at the
                    house of&mdash;</p>
                <p>Mrs. Villars?</p>
                <p>The same. Perhaps you know her and her character. <lb/> Perhaps you can confirm
                    or rectify my present opinions <lb/>
                    <pb n="128" entity="eaf033v2_0337" pid="uva-lib:349644"/> concerning her. It is
                    there that the unfortunate <reg orig="Cle-|menza">Clemenza</reg>
                    <lb/> abides. It is thence that I wish her to be speedily <lb/> removed.</p>
                <p>I have heard of you; of your conduct upon that <reg orig="oc-|casion"
                        >occasion</reg>.</p>
                <p>Of me? answered I eagerly. Do you know that woman? <lb/> So saying, I produced
                    the card which I had received from <lb/> her, and in which her name was
                    written.</p>
                <p>I know her well. She is my countrywoman and my <lb/> friend.</p>
                <p>Your friend? Then she is good; she is innocent; she is <lb/> generous. Will she
                    be a sister, a protectress to Clemenza? <lb/> Will you exhort her to a deed of
                    charity? Will you be, <lb/> yourself, an example of beneficence? Direct me to
                    Miss <lb/> Fielding, I beseech you. I have called on her already, but <lb/> in
                    vain, and there is no time to be lost.</p>
                <p>Why are you so precipitate? What would you do?</p>
                <p>Take her away from that house instantly&mdash;bring her <lb/> hither&mdash;place
                    her under your protection&mdash;give her Mrs. <lb/> Wentworth for a
                    counsellor&mdash;a friend&mdash;a mother. Shall I <lb/> do this? Shall I hie
                    thither today, this very hour&mdash;now? <lb/> Give me your consent, and she
                    shall be with you before <lb/> noon.</p>
                <p>By no means, replied she, with earnestness. You are <lb/> too hasty. An affair of
                    so much importance cannot be <reg orig="de-|spatched">despatched</reg>
                    <lb/> in a moment. There are many difficulties and <lb/> doubts to be first
                    removed.</p>
                <p>Let them be reserved for the future. Withhold not your <lb/> helping hand till
                    the struggle has disappeared forever. <lb/> Think on the gulf that is already
                    gaping to swallow her. <lb/> This is no time to hesitate and faulter. I will
                    tell you her <lb/> story, but not now; we will postpone it till tomorrow; and
                    <lb/> first secure her from impending evils. She shall tell it you <lb/>
                    herself. In an hour I will bring her hither, and she <reg orig="her-|self"
                        >herself</reg>
                    <lb/> shall recount to you her sorrows. Will you let me?</p>
                <p>Your behaviour is extraordinary. I can scarcely tell <lb/> whether this
                    simplicity be real or affected. One would <lb/> think that your common sense
                    would show you the <reg orig="impro-|priety">impropriety</reg>
                    <lb/> of your request. To admit under my roof a woman, <lb/> notoriously

                </pb>
                <p>My dearest madam! How can you reflect upon the <reg orig="situa-|tion"
                        >situation</reg>
                    <lb/> without irresistible pity? I see that you are thoroughly <lb/> aware of
                    her past calamity and her present danger. Do <lb/> not these urge you to make
                    haste to her relief? Can <lb/> any lot be more deplorable than hers? Can any
                    state be <lb/> more perilous? Poverty is not the only evil that oppresses, <lb/>
                    or that threatens her. The scorn of the world, and her own <lb/> compunction,
                    the death of the fruit of her error and the <reg orig="wit-|ness">witness</reg>
                    <lb/> of her shame, are not the worst. She is exposed to <lb/> the temptations
                    of the profligate; while she remains with <lb/> Mrs. Villars, her infamy
                    accumulates; her further <reg orig="debase-|ment">debasement</reg>
                    <lb/> is facilitated; her return to reputation and to virtue is <lb/> obstructed
                    by new bars.</p>
                <p>How know I that her debasement is not already complete <lb/> and irremediable?
                    She is a mother, but not a wife. How <lb/> came she thus? Is her being Welbeck's
                    prostitute no proof <lb/> of her guilt?</p>
                <p>Alas! I know not. I believe her not very culpable; I <lb/> know her to be
                    unfortunate; to have been robbed and <reg orig="be-|trayed">betrayed</reg>.
                    <lb/> You are a stranger to her history. I am myself <lb/> imperfectly
                    acquainted with it.</p>
                <p>But let me tell you the little that I know. Perhaps my <lb/> narrative may cause
                    you to think of her as I do.</p>
                <p>She did not object to this proposal, and I immediately <lb/> recounted all that I
                    had gained from my own observations, <lb/> or from Welbeck himself, respecting
                    this forlorn girl. <reg orig="Hav-|ving">Havving</reg>
                    <lb/> finished my narrative, I proceeded thus:&mdash;</p>
                <p>Can you hesitate to employ that power which was given <lb/> you for good ends, to
                    rescue this sufferer? Take her to <lb/> your home; to your bosom; to your
                    confidence. Keep <lb/> aloof those temptations which beset her in her present
                        <reg orig="situa-|tion">situation</reg>. <lb/> Restore her to that purity
                    which her desolate <reg orig="condi-|tion">condition</reg>, <lb/> her ignorance;
                    her misplaced gratitude and the <reg orig="arti-|fices">artifices</reg>
                    <lb/> of a skilful dissembler, have destroyed, if it be <reg orig="de-|stroyed"
                        >destroyed</reg>; <lb/> for how know we under what circumstances her <lb/>
                    ruin was accomplished? With what pretences or <reg orig="appear-|ances"
                        >appearances</reg>, <lb/> or promises she was won to compliance?</p>
                <p>True. I confess my ignorance; but ought not that <lb/> ignorance to be removed
                    before she makes a part of my <lb/> family?</p>
                <pb n="130" entity="eaf033v2_0339" pid="uva-lib:349646"/>
                <p>O no! It may be afterwards removed. It cannot be <reg orig="re-|moved"
                        >removed</reg>
                    <lb/> before. By bringing her hither you shield her, at <lb/> least, from future
                    and possible evils. Here you can watch <lb/> her conduct and sift her sentiments
                    conveniently and at <reg orig="lei-|sure">leisure</reg>. <lb/> Should she prove
                    worthy of your charity, how justly <lb/> may you congratulate yourself on your
                    seasonable efforts in <lb/> her cause? If she prove unworthy, you may then
                    demean <lb/> yourself according to her demerits.</p>
                <p>I must reflect upon it.&mdash;Tomorrow&mdash;</p>
                <p>Let me prevail on you to admit her at once, and without <lb/> delay. This very
                    moment may be the critical one. To <lb/> day we may exert ourselves with
                    success, but tomorrow, <lb/> all our efforts may be fruitless. Why fluctuate,
                    why linger, <lb/> when so much good may be done, and no evil can possibly <lb/>
                    be incurred? It requires but a word from you; you need <lb/> not move a finger.
                    Your house is large. You have <reg orig="cham-|bers">chambers</reg>
                    <lb/> vacant and convenient. Consent only that your door <lb/> shall not be
                    barred against her; that you will treat her with <lb/> civility; to carry your
                    kindness into effect; to persuade her <lb/> to attend me hither and to place
                    herself in your care, shall <lb/> be my province.</p>
                <p>These, and many similar entreaties and reasonings were <lb/> ineffectual. Her
                    general disposition was kind, but she was <lb/> unaccustomed to strenuous or
                    sudden exertions. To admit <lb/> the persuasions of such an advocate to so
                    uncommon a <lb/> scheme as that of sharing her house with a creature, thus <lb/>
                    previously unknown to her, thus loaded with suspicion and <lb/> with obloquy,
                    was not possible.</p>
                <p>I at last forebore importunity, and requested her to tell <lb/> me when I might
                    expect to meet with Mrs. Fielding at her <lb/> lodgings? Inquiry was made to
                    what end I sought an <reg orig="in-|terview">interview</reg>? <lb/> I made no
                    secret of my purpose.</p>
                <p>Are you mad, young man? she exclaimed. Mrs. <reg orig="Field-|ing">Fielding</reg>
                    <lb/> has already been egregiously imprudent. On the faith <lb/> of an ancient
                    slight acquaintance with Mrs. Villars in <reg orig="Eu-|rope">Europe</reg>,
                    <lb/> she suffered herself to be decoyed into a visit. Instead <lb/> of taking
                    warning by numerous tokens of the real character <lb/> of that woman, in her
                    behavior, and in that of her visitants, <lb/> she consented to remain there one
                    night. The next <reg orig="morn-|ing">morning</reg>
                    <lb/> took place that astonishing interview with you which <lb/> she has since
                    described to me. She is now warned against <lb/>
                    <pb n="131" entity="eaf033v2_0340" pid="uva-lib:349647"/> the like indiscretion.
                    And pray, what benevolent scheme <lb/> would you propose to her?</p>
                <p>Has she property? Is she rich?</p>
                <p>She is. Unhappily, perhaps, for her, she is absolute <reg orig="mis-|tress"
                        >mistress</reg>
                    <lb/> of her fortune, and has neither guardian nor parent to <lb/> control her
                    in the use of it.</p>
                <p>Has she virtue? Does she know the value of affluence <lb/> and a fair fame? And
                    will not she devote a few dollars to <lb/> rescue a fellow creature from
                    indigence, and infamy, and <lb/> vice? Surely she will. She will hazard nothing
                    by the <lb/> boon. I will be her almoner. I will provide the wretched <lb/>
                    stranger with food, and raiment, and dwelling, I will pay for <lb/> all, if Miss
                    Fielding, from her superfluity will supply the <lb/> means. Clemenza shall owe
                    life and honor to your friend, <lb/> till I am able to supply the needful sum
                    from my own stock.</p>
                <p>While thus speaking, my companion gazed at me with <lb/> steadfastness&mdash;I
                    know not what to make of you. Your <reg orig="lan-|guage">language</reg>
                    <lb/> and ideas are those of a lunatic. Are you acquainted <lb/> with Mrs.
                    Fielding?</p>
                <p>Yes. I have seen her two days ago, and she has invited <lb/> me to see her
                    again.</p>
                <p>And on the strength of this acquaintance, you expect to <lb/> be her almoner? To
                    be the medium of her charity?</p>
                <p>I desire to save her trouble; to make charity as light and <lb/> easy as
                    possible. 'Twill be better if she perform those <lb/> offices herself. 'Twill
                    redound more to the credit of her <lb/> reason and her virtue. But I solicit her
                    benignity only in <lb/> the cause of Clemenza. For her only do I wish at present
                    <lb/> to call forth her generosity and pity.</p>
                <p>And do you imagine she will entrust her money to one of <lb/> your age and sex,
                    whom she knows so imperfectly, to <reg orig="ad-|minister">administer</reg>
                    <lb/> to the wants of one whom she found in such a <lb/> house as Mrs.
                    Villars's? She never will. She mentioned <lb/> her imprudent engagement to meet
                    you, but she is now <lb/> warned against the folly of such confidence.</p>
                <p>You have told me plausible stories of yourself and of this <lb/> Clemenza. I
                    cannot say that I disbelieve them, but I <lb/> know the ways of the world too
                    well to bestow implicit faith <lb/> so easily. You are an extraordinary young
                    man. You <lb/> may possibly be honest. Such a one as you, with your <lb/>
                    education and address, may possibly have passed all your <lb/>
                    <pb n="132" entity="eaf033v2_0341" pid="uva-lib:349648"/> life in a hovel; but
                    it is scarcely credible, let me tell you. <lb/> I believe most of the facts
                    respecting my nephew, because <lb/> my knowledge of him before his flight, would
                    enable me to <lb/> detect your falsehood; but there must be other proofs <reg
                        orig="be-|sides">besides</reg>
                    <lb/> an innocent brow and a voluble tongue, to make me <lb/> give full credit
                    to your pretensions.</p>
                <p>I have no claim upon Welbeck which can embarrass you. <lb/> On that score, you
                    are free from any molestation from me <lb/> or my friends. I have suspected you
                    of being an <reg orig="accom-|plice">accomplice</reg>
                    <lb/> in some vile plot, and am now inclined to acquit you, <lb/> but that is
                    all that you must expect from me, till your <reg orig="cha-|racter"
                        >character</reg>
                    <lb/> be established by other means than your own <reg orig="asser-|tions"
                        >assertions</reg>. <lb/> I am engaged at present, and must therefore request
                    <lb/> you to put an end to your visit.</p>
                <p>This strain was much unlike the strain which preceded <lb/> it. I imagined, by
                    the mildness of her tone and manners, <lb/> that her unfavorable prepossessions
                    were removed, but they <lb/> seemed to have suddenly regained their pristine
                    force. I <lb/> was somewhat disconcerted by this unexpected change. I <lb/>
                    stood for a minute silent and irresolute.</p>
                <p>Just then a knock was heard at the door, and presently <lb/> entered that very
                    female whom I had met with at Villars's. <lb/> I caught her figure as I glanced
                    through the window. Mrs. <lb/> Wentworth darted at me many significant glances,
                    which <lb/> commanded me to withdraw; but with this object in view, <lb/> it was
                    impossible.</p>
                <p>As soon as she entered, her eyes were fixed upon me. <lb/> Certain recollections
                    naturally occurred at that moment, and <lb/> made her cheeks glow. Some
                    confusion reigned for a <reg orig="mo-|ment">moment</reg>, <lb/> but was quickly
                    dissipated. She did not notice me, <lb/> but exchanged salutations with her
                    friend.</p>
                <p>All this while I stood near the window, in a situation not <lb/> a little
                    painful. Certain tremors which I had not been <reg orig="ac-|customed"
                        >accustomed</reg>
                    <lb/> to feel, and which seemed to possess a mystical <lb/> relation to the
                    visitant, disabled me at once from taking my <lb/> leave, or from performing any
                    useful purpose by staying. <lb/> At length, struggling for composure, I
                    approached her, and <lb/> shewing her the card she had given me,
                    said:&mdash;</p>
                <p>Agreeably to this direction, I called, an hour ago, at your <lb/> lodgings. I
                    found you not. I hope you will permit me to <lb/>
                    <pb n="133" entity="eaf033v2_0342" pid="uva-lib:349649">

                    </pb> call once more. When shall I expect to meet you at <lb/> home?</p>
                <p>Her eyes were cast on the floor. A kind of indirect <lb/> attention was fixed on
                    Mrs. Wentworth, serving to <reg orig="intimi-|date">intimidate</reg>
                    <lb/> and check her. At length she said, in an irresolute <lb/> voice, I shall
                    be at home this evening.</p>
                <p>And this evening, replied I, I will call to see you. So <lb/> saying, I left the
                    house.</p>
                <p>This interval was tedious; but was to be endured with <lb/> equanimity. I was
                    impatient to be gone to Baltimore, and <lb/> hoped to be able to set out by the
                    dawn of next day. <lb/> Meanwhile, I was necessarily to perform something with
                    <lb/> respect to Clemenza.</p>
                <p>After dinner I accompanied Mrs. Stevens to visit Miss <lb/> Carlton. I was eager
                    to see a woman who could bear <reg orig="ad-|versity">adversity</reg>
                    <lb/> in the manner which my friend had described.</p>
                <p>She met us at the door of her apartment. Her <reg orig="serious-|ness"
                        >seriousness</reg>
                    <lb/> was not abated by her smiles of affability and welcome. <lb/> &mdash;"My
                    friend!" whispered I, "How truly lovely is this <lb/> Miss Carlton! Are the
                    heart and the intelligence within <lb/> worthy of these features?"</p>
                <p>"Yes, they are. Your account of her employments; <lb/> of her resignation to the
                    ill fate of the brother whom she <lb/> loves, proves that they are."</p>
                <p>My eyes were riveted to her countenance and person. <lb/> I felt uncontrolable
                    eagerness to speak to her, and to gain <lb/> her good opinion.</p>
                <p>You must know this young man, my dear Miss Carlton, <lb/> said my friend, looking
                    at me; he is my husband's friend, <lb/> and professes a great desire to be
                    yours. You must not <lb/> treat him as a mere stranger, for he knows your
                    character <lb/> and situation already, as well as that of your brother.</p>
                <p>She looked at me with benignity.&mdash;I accept his <reg orig="friend-|ship"
                        >friendship</reg>
                    <lb/> willingly and gratefully, and shall endeavor to convince <lb/> him that
                    his good opinion is not misplaced.</p>
                <p>There now ensued a conversation somewhat general, in <lb/> which this young woman
                    shewed a mind vigorous from <reg orig="ex-|ercise">exercise</reg>
                    <lb/> and unembarrassed by care. She affected no <reg orig="con-|cealment"
                        >concealment</reg>
                    <lb/> of her own condition, of her wants, or her <reg orig="com-|forts"
                        >comforts</reg>. <lb/> She laid no stress upon misfortunes, but contrived <lb/>
                    <pb n="134" entity="eaf033v2_0343" pid="uva-lib:349650"/> to deduce some
                    beneficial consequence to herself, and some <lb/> motive for gratitude to
                    Heaven, from every wayward <reg orig="inci-|dent">incident</reg>
                    <lb/> that had befallen her.</p>
                <p>This demeanor emboldened me, at length, to inquire into <lb/> the cause of her
                    brother's imprisonment, and the nature of <lb/> his debt.</p>
                <p>She answered frankly and without hesitation. It is a <lb/> debt of his father's,
                    for which he made himself responsible <lb/> during his father's life. The act
                    was generous but <reg orig="impru-|dent">imprudent</reg>, <lb/> as the event has
                    shewn; though, at the time, the <reg orig="un-|happy">unhappy</reg>
                    <lb/> effects could not be foreseen.</p>
                <p>My father, continued she, was arrested by his creditor, <lb/> at a time when the
                    calmness and comforts of his own <reg orig="dwell-|ing">dwelling</reg>
                    <lb/> were necessary to his health. The creditor was <reg orig="ob-|durate"
                        >obdurate</reg>, <lb/> and would release him upon no condition but that
                    <lb/> of receiving a bond from my brother, by which he engaged <lb/> to pay the
                    debt at several successive times and in small <reg orig="por-|tions"
                        >portions</reg>. <lb/> All these instalments were discharged with great
                    <lb/> difficulty indeed, but with sufficient punctuality, except the <lb/> last,
                    to which my brother's earnings were not adequate.</p>
                <p>How much is the debt?</p>
                <p>Four hundred dollars.</p>
                <p>And is the state of the creditor such as to make the loss <lb/> of four hundred
                    dollars of more importance to him than the <lb/> loss of liberty to your
                    brother?</p>
                <p>She answered, smiling, that is a very abstract view of <lb/> things. On such a
                    question, you and I might, perhaps, <lb/> easily decide in favor of my brother;
                    but would there not <lb/> be some danger of deciding partially? His conduct is a
                    <lb/> proof of his decision, and there is no power to change it.</p>
                <p>Will not argument change it? Methinks in so plain a case <lb/> I should be able
                    to convince him. You say he is rich and <lb/> childless. His annual income is
                    ten times more than this <lb/> sum. Your brother cannot pay the debt while in
                    prison; <lb/> whereas, if at liberty, he might slowly and finally discharge
                    <lb/> it. If his humanity would not yield, his avarice might be <lb/> brought to
                    acquiesce.</p>
                <p>But there is another passion which you would find it <lb/> somewhat harder to
                    subdue, and that is his vengeance. He <lb/> thinks himself wronged, and
                    imprisons my brother, not to <lb/> enforce payment, but to inflict misery. If
                    you could <reg orig="per-|suade">persuade</reg>
                    <lb/>
                    <pb n="135" entity="eaf033v2_0344" pid="uva-lib:349651"/> him, that there is no
                    hardship in imprisonment, you <lb/> would speedily gain the victory; but that
                    could not be <reg orig="at-|tempted">attempted</reg>
                    <lb/> consistently with truth. In proportion to my <reg orig="bro-|ther's"
                        >brother's</reg>
                    <lb/> suffering is his gratification.</p>
                <p>You draw an odious and almost incredible portrait.</p>
                <p>And yet such a one would serve for the likeness of <reg orig="al-|most"
                        >almost</reg>
                    <lb/> every second man we meet.</p>
                <p>And is such your opinion of mankind? Your experience <lb/> must surely have been
                    of a rueful tenor to justify such hard <lb/> thoughts of the rest of your
                    species.</p>
                <p>By no means. It has been what those whose situation <lb/> disables them from
                    looking further than the surface of things, <lb/> would regard as unfortunate;
                    but if my goods and evils <lb/> were equitably balanced, the former would be the
                        <reg orig="weight-|iest">weightiest</reg>. <lb/> I have found kindness and
                    goodness in great <reg orig="num-|bers">numbers</reg>, <lb/> but have likewise
                    met prejudice and rancor in many. <lb/> My opinion of Farquhar is not lightly
                    taken up. I saw <lb/> him yesterday, and the nature of his motives in the <reg
                        orig="treat-|ment">treatment</reg>
                    <lb/> of my brother was plain enough.</p>
                <p>Here this topic was succeeded by others, and the <reg orig="con-|versation"
                        >conversation</reg>
                    <lb/> ceased not till the hour had arrived on which I had <lb/> preconcerted to
                    visit Mrs. Fielding. I left my two friends <lb/> for this purpose.</p>
                <p>I was admitted to Mrs. Fielding's presence without <reg orig="scru-|ple"
                        >scruple</reg>
                    <lb/> or difficulty. There were two females in her company, <lb/> and one of the
                    other sex, well dressed, elderly, and sedate <lb/> persons. Their discourse
                    turned upon political topics, with <lb/> which, as you know, I have but slight
                    acquaintance. They <lb/> talked of fleets and armies, of Robespierre and Pitt,
                    of <lb/> whom I had only a newspaper knowledge.</p>
                <p>In a short time the women rose, and, huddling on their <lb/> cloaks, disappeared,
                    in company with the gentleman. <reg orig="Be-|ing">Being</reg>
                    <lb/> thus left alone with Mrs. Fielding, some embarrassment <lb/> was mutually
                    betrayed. With much hesitation, which, <reg orig="how-|ever">however</reg>,
                    <lb/> gradually disappeared, my companion, at length, began <lb/> the
                    conversation.</p>
                <p>You met me lately, in a situation, sir, on which I look <lb/> back with trembling
                    and shame, but not with any self-<reg orig="con-|demnation">condemnation</reg>.
                    <lb/> I was led into it without any fault, unless a <lb/> too hasty confidence
                    may be styled a fault. I had known <lb/> Mrs. Villars in England, where she
                    lived with an untainted <lb/>
                    <pb n="136" entity="eaf033v2_0345" pid="uva-lib:349652"/> reputation, at least;
                    and the sight of my countrywoman, in <lb/> a foreign land, awakened emotions, in
                    the indulgence of <lb/> which I did not imagine there was either any guilt or
                    any <lb/> danger. She invited me to see her at her house with so <lb/> much
                    urgency and warmth, and solicited me to take a place <lb/> immediately in a
                    chaise in which she had come to the city, <lb/> that I too incautiously
                    complied.</p>
                <p>You are a stranger to me, and I am unacquainted with <lb/> your character. What
                    little I have seen of your <reg orig="deport-|ment">deportment</reg>, <lb/> and
                    what little I have lately heard concerning you <lb/> from Mrs. Wentworth, do not
                    produce unfavorable <reg orig="impres-|sions">impressions</reg>; <lb/> but the
                    apology I have made was due to my own <lb/> reputation, and should have been
                    offered to you whatever <lb/> your character had been. There she stopped.</p>
                <p>I came not hither, said I, to receive an apology. Your <lb/> demeanor, on our
                    first interview, shielded you sufficiently <lb/> from any suspicions or surmises
                    that I could form. What <lb/> you have now mentioned was likewise mentioned by
                    your <lb/> friend, and was fully believed upon her authority. My <lb/> purpose,
                    in coming, related not to you but to another. I <lb/> desired merely to interest
                    your generosity and justice on <lb/> behalf of one, whose destitute and
                    dangerous condition may <lb/> lay claim to your compassion and your succor.</p>
                <p>I comprehend you, said she, with an air of some <reg orig="perplex-|ity"
                        >perplexity</reg>. <lb/> I know the claims of that person.</p>
                <p>And will you comply with them?</p>
                <p>In what manner can I serve her?</p>
                <p>By giving her the means of living.</p>
                <p>Does she not possess them already?</p>
                <p>She is destitute. Her dependence was wholly placed <lb/> upon one that is dead,
                    by whom her person was dishonored <lb/> and her fortune embezzled.</p>
                <p>But she still lives. She is not turned into the street. <lb/> She is not
                    destitute of home.</p>
                <p>But what a home?</p>
                <p>Such as she may choose to remain in.</p>
                <p>She cannot choose it. She must not choose it. She <reg orig="re-|mains"
                        >remains</reg>
                    <lb/> through ignorance, or through the incapacity of <lb/> leaving it.</p>
                <p>But how shall she be persuaded to a change?</p>
                <pb n="137" entity="eaf033v2_0346" pid="uva-lib:349653"/>
                <p>I will persuade her. I will fully explain her situation. <lb/> I will supply her
                    with a new home.</p>
                <p>You will persuade her to go with you, and to live at a <lb/> home of your
                    providing, and on your bounty?</p>
                <p>Certainly.</p>
                <p>Would that change be worthy of a cautious person? <lb/> Would it benefit her
                    reputation? Would it prove her love <lb/> of independence?</p>
                <p>My purposes are good. I know not why she should <reg orig="sus-|pect"
                        >suspect</reg>
                    <lb/> them. But I am only anxious to be the instrument. <lb/> Let her be
                    indebted to one of her own sex, of <reg orig="unques-|tionable"
                        >unquestionable</reg>
                    <lb/> reputation. Admit her into this house. Invite her <lb/> to your arms.
                    Cherish and console her as your sister.</p>
                <p>Before I am convinced that she deserves it? And even <lb/> then, what regard
                    shall I, young, unmarried, independent, <lb/> affluent, pay to my own reputation
                    in harboring a woman in <lb/> these circumstances?</p>
                <p>But you need not act yourself. Make me your agent <lb/> and almoner. Only supply
                    her with the means of <reg orig="subsist-|ence">subsistence</reg>
                    <lb/> through me.</p>
                <p>Would you have me act a clandestine part? Hold <reg orig="meet-|ings"
                        >meetings</reg>
                    <lb/> with one of your sex, and give him money for a purpose <lb/> which I must
                    hide from the world? Is it worth while to <lb/> be a dissembler and imposter?
                    And will not such conduct <lb/> incur more dangerous surmises and suspicions,
                    than would <lb/> arise from acting openly and directly? You will forgive <lb/>
                    me for reminding you likewise, that it is particularly <reg orig="incum-|bent"
                        >incumbent</reg>
                    <lb/> upon those in my situation, to be circumspect in their <lb/> intercourse
                    with men and with strangers. This is the <reg orig="se-|cond">second</reg>
                    <lb/> time that I have seen you. My knowledge of you is <lb/> extremely dubious
                    and imperfect, and such as would make <lb/> the conduct you prescribe to me, in
                    a high degree, rash and <lb/> culpable. You must not, therefore, expect me to
                    pursue it.</p>
                <p>These words were delivered with an air of firmness and <lb/> dignity. I was not
                    insensible to the truth of her <reg orig="representa-|tions"
                        >representations</reg>. <lb/> I confess, said I, what you have said makes me
                    <lb/> doubt the propriety of my proposal; yet I would fain be of <lb/> service
                    to her. Cannot you point out some practicable <lb/> method?</p>
                <p>She was silent and thoughtful, and seemed indisposed to <lb/> answer my
                    question.</p>
                <pb n="138" entity="eaf033v2_0347" pid="uva-lib:349654"/>
                <p>I had set my heart upon success in this negociation, <reg orig="con-|tinued"
                        >continued</reg>
                    <lb/> I, and could not imagine any obstacle to its success; <lb/> but I find my
                    ignorance of the world's ways much greater <lb/> than I had previously expected.
                    You defraud yourself of <lb/> all the happiness redounding from the act of
                    making others <lb/> happy. You sacrifice substance to show, and are more <lb/>
                    anxious to prevent unjust aspersions from lighting on <reg orig="your-|self"
                        >yourself</reg>, <lb/> than to rescue a fellow creature from guilt and
                    infamy.</p>
                <p>You are rich, and abound in all the conveniences and <lb/> luxuries of life. A
                    small portion of your superfluity would <lb/> obviate the wants of a being not
                    less worthy than yourself. <lb/> It is not avarice or aversion to labor that
                    makes you <reg orig="with-|hold">withhold</reg>
                    <lb/> your hand. It is dread of the sneers and surmises of <lb/> malevolence and
                    ignorance.</p>
                <p>I will not urge you further at present. Your <reg orig="determina-|tion"
                        >determination</reg>
                    <lb/> to be wise should not be hasty. Think upon the <reg orig="sub-|ject"
                        >subject</reg>
                    <lb/> calmly and sedately, and form your resolution in the <lb/> course of three
                    days. At the end of that period I will <lb/> visit you again. So saying, and
                    without waiting for <reg orig="com-|ment">comment</reg>
                    <lb/> or answer, I withdrew.</p>

                <p><hi rend="small-caps">I mounted</hi> the stage coach at day-break the next day,
                    <lb/> in company with a sallow Frenchman from Saint Domingo, <lb/> his
                    fiddle-case, an ape, and two female blacks. The <lb/> Frenchman, after passing
                    the suburbs, took out his violin and <lb/> amused himself with humming to his
                    own <hi rend="italic">tweedle tweedle.</hi>
                    <lb/> The monkey now and then mounched an apple, which was <lb/> given to him
                    from a basket by the blacks, who gazed with <lb/> stupid wonder, and an
                    exclamatory <hi rend="italic">La! La!</hi> upon the <lb/> passing scenery; or
                    chattered to each other in a sort of <lb/> open-mouthed, half articulate,
                    monotonous, and sing-song <lb/> jargon.</p>
                <p>The man looked seldom either on this side or that; and <lb/> spoke only to rebuke
                    the frolicks of the monkey, with a <lb/> Tenez! Dominique! Prenez garde! Diable
                    noir!</p>
                <p>As to me my thought was busy in a thousand ways. I <lb/>
                    <pb n="139" entity="eaf033v2_0348" pid="uva-lib:349655"/> sometimes gazed at the
                    faces of my <hi rend="italic">four</hi> companions, and <lb/> endeavored to
                    discern the differences and samenesses <reg orig="be-|tween">between</reg>
                    <lb/> them. I took an exact account of the features, <lb/> proportions, looks,
                    and gestures of the monkey, the <reg orig="Con-|golese">Congolese</reg>, <lb/>
                    and the Creole Gaul. I compared them together, <lb/> and examined them apart. I
                    looked at them in a <reg orig="thou-|sand">thousand</reg>
                    <lb/> different points of view, and pursued, untired and <lb/> unsatiated, those
                    trains of reflections which began at each <lb/> change of tone, feature, and
                    attitude.</p>
                <p>I marked the country as it successively arose before me, <lb/> and found endless
                    employment in examining the shape and <lb/> substance of the fence, the barn and
                    the cottage, the aspect <lb/> of earth and of heaven. How great are the
                    pleasures of <lb/> health and of mental activity.</p>
                <p>My chief occupation, however, related to the scenes into <lb/> which I was about
                    to enter. My imaginations were, of <lb/> course, crude and inadequate; and I
                    found an uncommon <lb/> gratification in comparing realities, as they
                    successively <reg orig="occur-|red">occurred</reg>, <lb/> with the pictures
                    which my wayward fancy had depicted.</p>
                <p>I will not describe my dreams. My proper task is to <lb/> relate the truth.
                    Neither shall I dwell upon the images <reg orig="sug-|gested">suggested</reg>
                    <lb/> by the condition of the country through which I <lb/> passed. I will
                    confine myself to mentioning the transactions <lb/> connected with the purpose
                    of my journey.</p>
                <p>I reached Baltimore at night. I was not so fatigued, but <lb/> that I could
                    ramble through the town. I intended, at present, <lb/> merely the gratification
                    of a stranger's curiosity. My visit <lb/> to Mrs. Watson and her brother I
                    designed should take <lb/> place on the morrow. The evening of my arrival I
                    deemed <lb/> an unseasonable time.</p>
                <p>While roving about, however, it occurred to me, that it <lb/> might not be
                    impolitic to find the way to their habitation even <lb/> now. My purposes of
                    general curiosity would equally be <lb/> served whichever way my steps were
                    bent; and, to trace <lb/> the path to their dwelling, would save me the trouble
                    of <lb/> inquiries and interrogations tomorrow.</p>
                <p>When I looked forward to an interview with the wife of <lb/> Watson, and to the
                    subject which would be necessarily <reg orig="dis-|cussed">discussed</reg>
                    <lb/> at that interview, I felt a trembling and misgiving at <lb/> my heart.
                    Surely, thought I, it will become me to exercise <lb/> immeasurable
                    circumspection and address; and yet how <lb/>
                    <pb n="140" entity="eaf033v2_0349" pid="uva-lib:349656"/> little are these
                    adapted to the impetuosity and candor of my <lb/> nature.</p>
                <p>How am I to introduce myself? What am I to tell her? <lb/> That I was a sort of
                    witness to the murder of her husband? <lb/> That I received from the hand of his
                    assassin the letter which <lb/> I afterwards transmitted to her? and, from the
                    same hands, <lb/> the bills contained in his girdle?</p>
                <p>How will she start and look aghast? What suspicions <lb/> will she harbor? What
                    inquiries shall be made of me? <lb/> How shall they be disarmed and eluded, or
                    answered? Deep <lb/> consideration will be necessary before I trust myself to
                    such <lb/> an interview. The coming night shall be devoted to <reg
                        orig="reflec-|tion">reflection</reg>
                    <lb/> upon this subject.</p>
                <p>From these thoughts I proceeded to inquiries for the <lb/> street mentioned in
                    the advertisement, where Mrs. Watson <lb/> was said to reside. The street, and,
                    at length, the <reg orig="habita-|tion">habitation</reg>, <lb/> was found.
                    Having reached a station opposite, I paused <lb/> and surveyed the mansion. It
                    was a wooden edifice of <lb/> two stories; humble, but neat. You ascended to the
                    door <lb/> by several stone steps. Of the two lower windows, the <lb/> shutters
                    of one were closed, but those of the other were <lb/> open. Though late in the
                    evening, there was no <reg orig="appear-|ance">appearance</reg>
                    <lb/> of light or fire within.</p>
                <p>Beside the house was a painted fence, through which <lb/> was a gate leading to
                    the back of the building. Guided by <lb/> the impulse of the moment, I crossed
                    the street to the gate, <lb/> and, lifting the latch, entered the paved alley,
                    on one side <lb/> of which was a paled fence, and on the other the house, <lb/>
                    looking through two windows into the alley.</p>
                <p>The first window was dark like those in front; but at the <lb/> second a light
                    was discernible. I approached it, and, <reg orig="look-|ing">looking</reg>
                    <lb/> through, beheld a plain but neat apartment, in which <lb/> parlour,
                    kitchen, and nursery seemed to be united. A fire <lb/> burnt cheerfully in the
                    chimney, over which was a teakettle. <lb/> On the hearth sat a smiling and
                    playful cherub of a boy, <lb/> tossing something to a black girl who sat
                    opposite, and whose <lb/> innocent and regular features wanted only a different
                    hue <lb/> to make them beautiful. Near it, in a rocking chair, with <lb/> a
                    sleeping babe in her lap, sat a female figure in plain but <lb/> neat and
                    becoming attire. Her posture permitted half her <lb/>
                    <pb n="141" entity="eaf033v2_0350" pid="uva-lib:349657">

                    </pb> face to be seen, and saved me from any danger of being <lb/> observed.</p>
                <p>This countenance was full of sweetness and benignity, <lb/> but the sadness that
                    veiled its lustre was profound. Her <lb/> eyes were now fixed upon the fire and
                    were moist with the <lb/> tears of remembrance, while she sung, in low and
                    scarcely <lb/> audible strains, an artless lullaby.</p>
                <p>This spectacle exercised a strange power over my <reg orig="feel-|ings"
                        >feelings</reg>. <lb/> While occupied in meditating on the features of the
                    <lb/> mother, I was unaware of my conspicuous situation. The <lb/> black girl
                    having occasion to change her situation, in order <lb/> to reach the ball which
                    was thrown at her, unluckily caught <lb/> a glance of my figure through the
                    glass. In a tone of half <lb/> surprise and half terror, she cried out&mdash;O!
                    see dare! a <lb/> man!</p>
                <p>I was tempted to draw suddenly back, but a second <lb/> thought shewed me the
                    impropriety of departing thus <reg orig="abrupt-|ly">abruptly</reg>, <lb/> and
                    leaving behind me some alarm. I felt a sort of <lb/> necessity for apologizing
                    for my intrusion into these precincts, <lb/> and hastened to a door that led
                    into the same apartment. <lb/> I knocked. A voice somewhat confused bade me
                    enter. <lb/> It was not till I opened the door and entered the room, that <lb/>
                    I fully saw in what embarrassments I had incautiously <reg orig="in-|volved"
                        >involved</reg>
                    <lb/> myself.</p>
                <p>I could scarcely obtain sufficient courage to speak, and <lb/> gave a confused
                    assent to the question&mdash;"Have you <reg orig="busi-|ness">business</reg>
                    <lb/> with me, sir?" She offered me a chair, and I sat <lb/> down. She put the
                    child, not yet awakened, into the arms <lb/> of the black, who kissed it and
                    rocked it in her arms with <lb/> great satisfaction, and, resuming her seat,
                    looked at me with <lb/> inquisitiveness mingled with complacency.</p>
                <p>After a moment's pause, I said&mdash;I was directed to this <lb/> house as the
                    abode of Mr. Ephraim Williams. Can he be <lb/> seen, madam?</p>
                <p>He is not in town at present. If you will leave a message <lb/> with me, I will
                    punctually deliver it.</p>
                <p>The thought suddenly occurred, whether, any more was <lb/> needful than merely to
                    leave the bills suitably enclosed, as <lb/> they already were, in a packet. Thus
                    all painful <reg orig="explana-|tions">explanations</reg>
                    <lb/> might be avoided, and I might have reason to <reg orig="congra-|tulate"
                        >congratulate</reg>
                    <lb/>
                    <pb n="142" entity="eaf033v2_0351" pid="uva-lib:349658"/> myself on his
                    seasonable absence. Actuated by these <lb/> thoughts, I drew forth the packet,
                    and put it into her hand, <lb/> saying, I will leave this in your possession,
                    and must <reg orig="earnest-|ly">earnestly</reg>
                    <lb/> request you to keep it safe until you can deliver it into <lb/> his own
                    hands.</p>
                <p>Scarcely had I said this before new suggestions occurred. <lb/> Was it right to
                    act in this clandestine and mysterious <reg orig="man-|ner">manner</reg>? <lb/>
                    Should I leave these persons in uncertainty <reg orig="respect-|ing"
                        >respecting</reg>
                    <lb/> the fate of a husband and a brother? What <reg orig="perplexi-|ties"
                        >perplexities</reg>, <lb/> misunderstandings, and suspenses might not grow
                    out of <lb/> this uncertainty; and ought they not to be precluded at any <lb/>
                    hazard to my own safety or good name?</p>
                <p>These sentiments made me involuntarily stretch forth my <lb/> hand to retake the
                    packet. This gesture, and other <reg orig="singni-|ficances"
                        >singnificances</reg>
                    <lb/> in my manners, joined to a trembling consciousness <lb/> in herself,
                    filled my companion with all the tokens of <reg orig="con-|fusion"
                        >confusion</reg>
                    <lb/> and fear. She alternately looked at me and at the <lb/> paper. Her
                    trepidation increased, and she grew pale. <lb/> These emotions were counteracted
                    by a strong effort.</p>
                <p>At length she said, falteringly, I will take good care of <lb/> them, and will
                    give them to my brother.</p>
                <p>She rose and placed them in a drawer, after which she <lb/> resumed her seat.</p>
                <p>On this occasion all my wariness forsook me. I cannot <reg orig="ex-|plain"
                        >explain</reg>
                    <lb/> why my perplexity and the trouble of my thoughts were <lb/> greater upon
                    this than upon similar occasions. However it <lb/> be, I was incapable of
                    speaking, and fixed my eyes upon <lb/> the floor. A sort of electrical sympathy
                    pervaded my <reg orig="com-|panion">companion</reg>, <lb/> and terror and
                    anguish were strongly manifested in <lb/> the glances which she sometimes stole
                    at me. We seemed <lb/> fully to understand each other without the aid of
                    words.</p>
                <p>This imbecility could not last long. I gradually <reg orig="recov-|ered"
                        >recovered</reg>
                    <lb/> my composure, and collected my scattered thoughts. <lb/> I looked at her
                    with seriousness, and steadfastly spoke&mdash; <lb/> Are you the wife of Amos
                    Watson?</p>
                <p>She started.&mdash;I am, indeed. Why do you ask? Do <lb/> you know any thing of
                    &mdash;&mdash;? There her voice failed.</p>
                <p>I replied with quickness, yes. I am fully acquainted <lb/> with his destiny.</p>
                <p>Good God! she exclaimed in a paroxysm of surprise, <lb/> and bending eagerly
                    forward, my husband is then alive. <lb/>
                    <pb n="143" entity="eaf033v2_0352" pid="uva-lib:349659"/> This packet is from
                    him. Where is he? When have you <lb/> seen him?</p>
                <p>'Tis a long time since.</p>
                <p>But where, where is he now? Is he well? Will he <reg orig="re-|turn">return</reg>
                    <lb/> to me?</p>
                <p>Never.</p>
                <p>Merciful Heaven! looking upwards and clasping her <lb/> hands, I thank thee at
                    least for his life! But why has he <lb/> forsaken me? Why will he not
                    return?</p>
                <p>For a good reason, said I, with augmented solemnity, he <lb/> will never return
                    to thee. Long ago was he laid in the cold <lb/> grave.</p>
                <p>She shrieked; and, at the next moment, sunk in a swoon <lb/> upon the floor. I
                    was alarmed. The two children shrieked, <lb/> and ran about the room terrified
                    and unknowing what they <lb/> did. I was overwhelmed with somewhat like terror,
                    yet I <lb/> involuntarily raised the mother in my arms, and cast about <lb/> for
                    the means of recalling her from this fit.</p>
                <p>Time to effect this had not elapsed, when several persons, <lb/> apparently Mrs.
                    Watson's neighbors, and raised by the <reg orig="out-|cries">outcries</reg>
                    <lb/> of the girls, hastily entered the room. They looked <lb/> at me with
                    mingled surprise and suspicion; but my attitude, <lb/> being not that of an
                    injurer but helper; my countenance, <lb/> which shewed the pleasure their
                    entrance, at this critical <lb/> moment, afforded me; and my words, in which I
                    besought <lb/> their assistance, and explained, in some degree, and briefly,
                    <lb/> the cause of those appearances, removed their ill thoughts.</p>
                <p>Presently, the unhappy woman, being carried by the new <lb/> comers into a
                    bed-room adjoining, recovered her sensibility. <lb/> I only waited for this. I
                    had done my part. More <reg orig="infor-|mation">information</reg>
                    <lb/> would be useless to her, and not to be given by me, <lb/> at least, in the
                    present audience, without embarrassment and <lb/> peril. I suddenly determined
                    to withdraw, and this, the <reg orig="at-|tention">attention</reg>
                    <lb/> of the company being otherwise engaged, I did <reg orig="with-|out"
                        >without</reg>
                    <lb/> notice. I returned to my inn, and shut myself up in <lb/> my chamber. Such
                    was the change which, undesigned, <lb/> unforeseen, half an hour had wrought in
                    my situation. My <lb/> cautious projects had perished in their conception. That
                    <lb/> which I had deemed so arduous, to require such <reg orig="circum-|spect"
                        >circumspect</reg>
                    <lb/> approaches, such well concerted speeches, was done.</p>
                <p>I had started up before this woman as if from the pores of <lb/>
                    <pb n="144" entity="eaf033v2_0353" pid="uva-lib:349660"/> the ground. I had
                    vanished with the same celerity, but had <lb/> left her in possession of proofs
                    sufficient that I was neither <lb/> spectre nor demon. I will visit her, said I,
                    again. I will <lb/> see her brother, und know the full effect of my disclosure.
                    <lb/> I will tell them all that I myself know. Ignorance would be <lb/> no less
                    injurious to them than to myself; but, first, I will see <lb/> the Maurices.</p>

                    <lb/> delay. I had eight or ten miles to walk, so far from the <lb/> town being
                    the residence of these people; and I forthwith <lb/> repaired to their dwelling.
                    The persons whom I desired <lb/> to see were known to me only by name, and by
                    their place <lb/> of abode. It was a mother and her three daughters to whom
                    <lb/> I now carried the means not only of competence but riches; <lb/> means,
                    which they, no doubt, had long ago despaired of <reg orig="re-|gaining"

                    <lb/> my age and guise would be the least suspected of being able <lb/> to
                    restore.</p>
                <p>I arrived, through intricate ways, at eleven o'clock, at the <lb/> house of Mrs.
                    Maurice. It was a neat dwelling, in a very <lb/> fanciful and rustic style, in
                    the bosom of a valley, which, <lb/> when decorated by the verdure and blossoms
                    of the coming <lb/> season, must possess many charms. At present it was <reg
                        orig="na-|ked">naked</reg>
                    <lb/> and dreary.</p>
                <p>As I approached it, through a long avenue, I observed <lb/> two female figures,
                    walking arm-in-arm and slowly to and <lb/> fro, in the path in which I now was.
                    These, said I, are <lb/> daughters of the family. Graceful, well-dressed, <reg

                <p>A single glance, cast at each, made me suspect that they <lb/> were not sisters;
                    but, somewhat to my disappointment, there <lb/> was nothing highly prepossessing
                    in the countenance of <lb/> either. They were what is every day met with, though
                    less <lb/> embellished by brilliant drapery and turban, in markets and <lb/>
                    streets. An air, somewhat haughty, somewhat supercilious, <lb/> lessened still
                    more their attractions. These defects, <reg orig="how-|ever">however</reg>,
                    <lb/> were nothing to me.</p>
                <p>I inquired, of her that seemed to be the elder of the two, <lb/> for Mrs.
                    Maurice.</p>
                <p>She is indisposed, was the cold reply.</p>
                <p>That is unfortunate. Is it not possible to see her?</p>
                <p>No&mdash;with still more gravity.</p>
                <p>I was somewhat at a loss how to proceed. A pause <reg orig="en-|sued"

                <p>She is very indisposed, interrupted she peevishly. If <lb/> you cannot leave your
                    message, you may take it back again, <lb/> for she must not be disturbed.</p>
                <p>This was a singular reception. I was disconcerted and <lb/> silent. I knew not
                    what to say. Perhaps, I at last <reg orig="ob-|served">observed</reg>, <lb/>
                    some other time&mdash;</p>
                <p>No, with increasing heat, no other time. She is more <lb/> likely to be worse
                    than better. Come, Betsey, said she, <lb/> taking hold of her companion's arm;
                    and, hieing into the <lb/> house, shut the door after her, and disappeared. I
                    stood, <lb/> at the bottom of the steps, confounded at such strange and <lb/>
                    unexpected treatment. I could not withdraw till my <reg orig="pur-|pose"
                        >purpose</reg>
                    <lb/> was accomplished. After a moment's pause, I stepped <lb/> to the door, and
                    pulled the bell. A negro came, of a very <lb/> unpropitious aspect, and opening
                    the door, looked at me in <lb/> silence. To my question, was Mrs. Maurice to be
                    seen? <lb/> he made some answer, in a jargon which I could not <reg
                        orig="un-|derstand">understand</reg>; <lb/> but his words were immediately
                    followed by an <lb/> unseen person within the house&mdash;Mrs. Maurice can't be
                    <lb/> seen by any body. Come in, Cato, and shut the door. <lb/> This injunction
                    was obeyed by Cato without ceremony.</p>
                <pb n="146" entity="eaf033v2_0355" pid="uva-lib:349662"/>
                <p>Here was a dilemma! I came with ten thousand pounds <lb/> in my hands, to bestow
                    freely on these people, and such was <lb/> the treatment I received. I must
                    adopt said I, a new mode.</p>
                <p>I lifted the latch, without a second warning, and, Cato <lb/> having disappeared,
                    went into a room, the door of which <lb/> chanced to be open, on my right hand.
                    I found within the <lb/> two females whom I had accosted in the portico. I now
                    <lb/> addressed myself to the younger&mdash;This intrusion, when I <lb/> have
                    explained the reason of it, will, I hope, be forgiven. <lb/> I come,
                    madam&mdash;</p>
                <p>Yes, interrupted the other, with a countenance suffused by <lb/> indignation, I
                    know very well whom you come from, and <lb/> what it is that prompts this
                    insolence, but your employer <lb/> shall see that we have not sunk so low as he
                    imagines. <lb/> Cato! Bob! I say.</p>
                <p>My employer, madam! I see you labor under some <lb/> great mistake. I have no
                    employer. I come from a great <lb/> distance. I come to bring intelligence of
                    the utmost <reg orig="im-|portance">importance</reg>
                    <lb/> to your family. I come to benefit and not to <reg orig="in-|jure"
                        >injure</reg>
                    <lb/> you.</p>
                <p>By this time, Bob and Cato, two sturdy blacks, entered <lb/> the room. Turn this
                    person, said the imperious lady, <reg orig="re-|gardless">regardless</reg>
                    <lb/> of my explanations, out of the house. Don't you <lb/> hear me? she
                    continued, observing that they looked one <lb/> upon the other and
                    hesitated.</p>
                <p>Surely, madam, said I, you are precipitate. You are <lb/> treating like an enemy
                    one who will prove himself your <lb/> mother's best friend.</p>
                <p>Will you leave the house? she exclaimed, quite beside <lb/> herself with anger.
                    Villains! why don't you do as I bid <lb/> you?</p>
                <p>The blacks looked upon each other, as if waiting for an <lb/> example. Their
                    habitual deference for every thing <hi rend="italic">white,</hi>
                    <lb/> no doubt, held their hands from what they regarded as a <lb/> profanation.
                    At last Bob said, in a whining, beseeching <lb/> tone&mdash;Why, misse, massa
                    buckra wanna go for doo, dan he <lb/> winna go fo' wee.</p>
                <p>The lady now burst into tears of rage. She held out <lb/> her hand, menacingly.
                    Will you leave the house?</p>
                <p>Not willingly, said I, in a mild tone. I came too far to <lb/> return with the
                    business that brought me unperformed. I <lb/>
                    <pb n="147" entity="eaf033v2_0356" pid="uva-lib:349663"/> am persuaded, madam,
                    you mistake my character and my <lb/> views. I have a message to deliver your
                    mother which <lb/> deeply concerns her and your happiness, if you are her <lb/>
                    daughter. I merely wished to see her, and leave with her <lb/> a piece of
                    important news; news in which her fortune is <lb/> deeply interested.</p>
                <p>These words had a wonderful effect upon the young lady. <lb/> Her anger was
                    checked. Good God! she exclaimed, are <lb/> you Watson?</p>
                <p>No; I am only Watson's representative, and come to do <lb/> all that Watson could
                    do if he were present.</p>
                <p>She was now importunate to know my business.</p>
                <p>My business lies with Mrs. Maurice. Advertisements, <lb/> which I have seen,
                    direct me to her, and to this house, and <lb/> to her only shall I deliver my
                    message.</p>
                <p>Perhaps, said she, with a face of apology, I have <reg orig="mis-|taken"
                        >mistaken</reg>
                    <lb/> you. Mrs. Maurice is my mother. She is really <reg orig="in-|disposed"
                        >indisposed</reg>, <lb/> but I can stand in her place on this occasion.</p>
                <p>You cannot represent her in this instance. If I cannot <lb/> have access to her
                    now, I must go; and shall return when <lb/> you are willing to grant it.</p>
                <p>Nay, replied she, she is not, perhaps, so very sick but <lb/> that&mdash;I will
                    go, and see if she will admit you.&mdash;So saying, <lb/> she left me for three
                    minutes; and returning said, her <lb/> mother wished to see me.</p>
                <p>I followed up stairs, at her request; and, entering an <reg orig="ill-|furnished"
                        >illfurnished</reg>
                    <lb/> chamber, found, seated in an arm chair, a lady <lb/> seemingly in years,
                    pale and visibly infirm. The lines of <lb/> her countenance were far from laying
                    claim to my <reg orig="reve-|rence">reverence</reg>. <lb/> It was too much like
                    the daughter's.</p>
                <p>She looked at me, at my entrance, with great eagerness, <lb/> and said, in a
                    sharp tone, pray, friend, what is it you want <lb/> with me? Make haste; tell
                    your story, and begone.</p>
                <p>My story is a short one, and easily told. Amos <reg orig="Wat-|son">Watson</reg>
                    <lb/> was your agent in Jamaica. He sold an estate <reg orig="belong-|ing"
                        >belonging</reg>
                    <lb/> to you, and received the money.</p>
                <p>He did, said she, attempting ineffectually to rise from her <lb/> seat, and her
                    eyes beaming with a significance that shocked <lb/> me&mdash;He did, the
                    villain, and purloined the money, to the <lb/> ruin of me and my daughters. But
                    if there be justice on <lb/> earth it will overtake him. I trust, I shall have
                    the <reg orig="plea-|sure">pleasure</reg>
                    <lb/>
                    <pb n="148" entity="eaf033v2_0357" pid="uva-lib:349664"/> one day&mdash;I hope
                    to hear he's hanged. Well, but go <lb/> on, friend. He <hi rend="italic"
                        >did</hi> sell it, I tell you.</p>
                <p>He sold it for ten thousand pounds, I resumed, and <reg orig="in-|vested"
                        >invested</reg>
                    <lb/> this sum in bills of exchange. Watson is dead. <lb/> These bills came into
                    my hands. I was lately informed, by <lb/> the public papers, who were the real
                    owners, and have <lb/> come from Philadelphia with no other view than to restore
                    <lb/> them to you. There they are, continued I, placing them <lb/> in her lap,
                    entire and untouched.</p>
                <p>She seized the papers, and looked at me and at her <lb/> daughter, by turns, with
                    an air of one suddenly bewildered. <lb/> She seemed speechless, and growing
                    suddenly more ghastly <lb/> pale, leaned her head back upon the chair. The
                    daughter <lb/> screamed, and hastened to support the languid parent, who <lb/>
                    difficulty articulated&mdash;O! I am sick; sick to death. Put <lb/> me on the
                    bed.</p>
                <p>I was astonished and affrighted at this scene. Some of <lb/> the domestics, of
                    both colors, entered, and gazed at me <lb/> with surprise. Involuntarily I
                    withdrew, and returned to <lb/> the room below, into which I had first entered,
                    and which <lb/> I now found deserted.</p>
                <p>I was for some time at a loss to guess at the cause of <lb/> these appearances.
                    At length it occurred to me, that joy <lb/> was the source of the sickness that
                    had seized Mrs. <reg orig="Mau-|rice">Maurice</reg>. <lb/> The abrupt recovery
                    of what had probably been <lb/> deemed irretrievable, would naturally produce
                    this effect <lb/> upon a mind of a certain texture.</p>
                <p>I was deliberating, whether to stay or go, when the <lb/> daughter entered the
                    room, and, after expressing some <lb/> surprise at seeing me, whom she supposed
                    to have <reg orig="re-|tired">retired</reg>, <lb/> told me that her mother
                    wished to see me again <reg orig="be-|fore">before</reg>
                    <lb/> my departure. In this request there was no kindness. <lb/> All was cold,
                    supercilious, and sullen. I obeyed the <reg orig="sum-|mons">summons</reg>
                    <lb/> without speaking.</p>
                <p>I found Mrs. Maurice seated in her arm chair, much in <lb/> her former guise.
                    Without desiring me to be seated, or <lb/> relaxing aught in her asperity of
                    looks and tones&mdash;Pray, <lb/> friend, how did you <hi rend="italic">come
                        by</hi> these papers?</p>
                <p>I assure you, madam, they were honestly <hi rend="italic">come by,</hi>
                    <reg orig="an-|swered">answered</reg>
                    <lb/> I, sedately and with half a smile; but, if the whole <lb/> is there that
                    was missing, the mode and time in which they <lb/>
                    <pb n="149" entity="eaf033v2_0358" pid="uva-lib:349665"/> came to me is matter
                    of concern only to myself. Is there <lb/> any deficiency?</p>
                <p>I am not sure. I don't know much of these matters. <lb/> There may be less. I
                    dare say there is. I shall know that <lb/> soon. I expect a friend of mine every
                    minute who will <lb/> look them over. I don't doubt you can give a good <reg
                        orig="ac-|count">account</reg>
                    <lb/> of yourself.</p>
                <p>I doubt not but I can&mdash;to those who have a right to <reg orig="de-|mand"
                        >demand</reg>
                    <lb/> it. In this case, curiosity must be very urgent <reg orig="in-|deed"
                        >indeed</reg>, <lb/> before I shall consent to gratify it.</p>
                <p>You must know this is a suspicious case. Watson, to <lb/> be sure, embezzled the
                    money; to be sure, you are his <lb/> accomplice.</p>
                <p>Certainly, said I, my conduct, on this occasion, proves <lb/> that. What I have
                    brought to you, of my own accord; <lb/> what I have restored to you, fully and
                    unconditionally, it is <lb/> plain Watson embezzled, and that I was aiding in
                    the fraud. <lb/> To restore what was never stolen always betrays the thief.
                    <lb/> To give what might be kept without suspicion, is, without <lb/> doubt,
                    arrant knavery.&mdash;To be serious, madam, in coming <lb/> thus far, for this
                    purpose, I have done enough; and must <lb/> now bid you farewell.</p>
                <p>Nay, don't go yet. I have something more to say to you. <lb/> My friend, I'm
                    sure, will be here presently. There he is; <lb/> noticing a peal upon the bell.
                    Polly, go down, and see if that's <lb/> Mr. Somers. If it is, bring him up. The
                    daughter went.</p>
                <p>I walked to the window absorbed in my own reflections. <lb/> I was disappointed
                    and dejected. The scene before me <lb/> was the unpleasing reverse of all that
                    my fancy, while <lb/> coming hither, had foreboded. I expected to find virtuous
                    <lb/> indigence and sorrow lifted, by my means, to affluence and <lb/>
                    exultation. I expected to witness the tears of gratitude and <lb/> the caresses
                    of affection. What had I found? Nothing <lb/> but sordidness, stupidity, and
                    illiberal suspicion.</p>
                <p>The daughter stayed much longer than the mother's <reg orig="pa-|tience"
                        >patience</reg>
                    <lb/> could endure. She knocked against the floor with <lb/> her heel. A servant
                    came up.&mdash;Where's Polly, you slut? <lb/> It was not you, hussey, that I
                    wanted. It was her.</p>
                <p>She is talking in the parlor with a gentleman.</p>
                <p>Mr. Somers, I suppose; hey! fool! Run with my <reg orig="com-|pliments"
                        >compliments</reg>
                    <lb/> to him, wench. Tell him, please walk up.</p>
                <pb n="150" entity="eaf033v2_0359" pid="uva-lib:349666"/>
                <p>It is not Mr. Somers, ma'am.</p>
                <p>No! Who then, saucebox? What gentleman can have <lb/> any thing to do with
                    Polly?</p>
                <p>I don't know ma'am.</p>
                <p>Who said you did, impertinence? Run, and tell her I <lb/> want her this
                    instant.</p>
                <p>The summons was not delivered, or Polly did not think <lb/> proper to obey it.
                    Full ten minutes of thoughtful silence <lb/> on my part, and of muttered
                    vexation and impatience on <lb/> that of the old lady, elapsed before Polly's
                    entrance. As <lb/> soon as she appeared, the mother began to complain <reg
                        orig="bit-|terly">bitterly</reg>
                    <lb/> of her inattention and neglect; but Polly, taking no <lb/> notice of her,
                    addressed herself to me, and told me, that a <lb/> gentleman below wished to see
                    me. I hastened down, and <lb/> found a stranger, of a plain appearance, in the
                    parlor. His <lb/> aspect was liberal and ingenuous; and I quickly collected
                    <lb/> from his discourse, that this was the brother in law of <reg
                        orig="Wat-|son">Watson</reg>, <lb/> and the companion of his last
                    voyage.</p>

                    desire to communicate <lb/> all the knowledge of his brother's destiny which I
                    possessed. <lb/> He told me, that, returning late to Baltimore, on the last

                    after a time, she explained to him. She likewise <lb/> put the packets I had

                <p>I leave you to imagine, continued he, my surprise and <lb/> curiosity at this

                    extraordinary tidings. This morning, <lb/> inquiring for one of your appearance
                    at the taverns, I was, <lb/> at length, informed of your arrival yesterday in
                    the stage; <lb/> of your going out alone in the evening; of your <reg
                        orig="subse-|quent">subsequent</reg>
                    <lb/> return; and of your early departure this morning. <lb/> Accidentally I
                    lighted on your footsteps; and, by suitable <lb/> inquiries on the road, have
                    finally traced you hither.</p>
                <pb n="151" entity="eaf033v2_0360" pid="uva-lib:349667"/>
                <p>You told my sister her husband was dead. You left <lb/> with her papers that were
                    probably in his possession at the <lb/> time of his death. I understand from
                    Miss Maurice that <lb/> the bills belonging to her mother, have just been
                    delivered <lb/> to her. I presume you have no objection to clear up this <lb/>
                    mystery.</p>
                <p>To you I am anxious to unfold every thing. At this <lb/> moment, or at any time,
                    but the sooner, the more agreeable <lb/> to me, I will do it.</p>
                <p>This, said he, looking around him, is no place; there is <lb/> an inn, not a
                    hundred yards from this gate, where I have <lb/> left my horse; will you go
                    thither? I readily consented, and <lb/> calling for a private apartment, I laid
                    before this man, <lb/> every incident of my life connected with Welbeck and
                    <lb/> Watson; my full, circumstantial, and explicit story, <reg
                        orig="ap-|peared">appeared</reg>
                    <lb/> to remove every doubt which he might have <reg orig="enter-|tained"
                        >entertained</reg>
                    <lb/> of my integrity.</p>
                <p>In Williams, I found a plain good man, of a temper <reg orig="con-|fiding"
                        >confiding</reg>
                    <lb/> and affectionate. My narration being finished, he <lb/> expressed, by
                    unaffected tokens, his wonder and his grief on <lb/> account of Watson's
                    destiny. To my inquiries, which were <lb/> made with frankness and fervor,
                    respecting his own and his <lb/> sister's condition, he said, that the situation
                    of both was <reg orig="de-|plorable">deplorable</reg>
                    <lb/> till the recovery of this property. They had been <lb/> saved from utter
                    ruin, from beggary and a jail, only by the <lb/> generosity and lenity of his
                    creditors, who did not suffer the <lb/> suspicious circumstances attending
                    Watson's disappearance <lb/> so outweigh former proofs of his probity. They had
                    never <lb/> relinquished the hopes of receiving some tidings of their <lb/>
                    kinsman.</p>
                <p>I related what had just passed in the house of Mrs. <lb/> Maurice, and requested
                    to know from him the history and <lb/> character of this family.</p>
                <p>They have treated you, he answered, exactly as any one <lb/> who knew them would
                    have predicted. The mother is <lb/> narrow, ignorant, bigotted, and avaricious.
                    The eldest <lb/> daughter, whom you saw, resembles the old lady in many <lb/>
                    things. Age, indeed, may render the similitude complete. <lb/> At present, pride
                    and ill-humor are her chief <reg orig="charac-|teristics"
                    >characteristics</reg>.</p>
                <pb n="152" entity="eaf033v2_0361" pid="uva-lib:349668"/>
                <p>The youngest daughter has nothing in mind or person in <lb/> common with her
                    family. Where they are irascible, she <lb/> is patient; where they are
                    imperious, she is humble; where <lb/> they are covetous, she is liberal; where
                    they are ignorant <lb/> and indolent, she is studious and skilful. It is rare,
                    indeed, <lb/> to find a young lady more amiable than Miss Fanny <reg
                        orig="Mau-|rice">Maurice</reg>, <lb/> or who has had more crosses and
                    afflictions to sustain.</p>
                <p>The eldest daughter always extorted the supply of her <lb/> wants, from her
                    parents, by threats and importunities; but <lb/> the younger could never be
                    prevailed upon to employ the <lb/> same means, and, hence, she suffered
                    inconveniences which, <lb/> to any other girl, born to an equal rank, would have
                    been, <lb/> to the last degree, humiliating and vexatious. To her they <lb/>
                    only afforded new opportunities for the display of her most <lb/> shining
                    virtues&mdash;fortitude and charity. No instance of <lb/> their sordidness or
                    tyranny ever stole a murmur from her. <lb/> For what they had given, existence
                    and a virtuous <reg orig="educa-|tion">education</reg>, <lb/> she said they were
                    entitled to gratitude. What they <lb/> withheld was their own, in the use of
                    which they were not <lb/> accountable to her. She was not ashamed to owe her
                        <reg orig="sub-|sistence">subsistence</reg>
                    <lb/> to her own industry, and was only held, by the <lb/> pride of her
                    family&mdash;in this instance their pride was equal <lb/> to their
                    avarice&mdash;from seeking out some lucrative kind of <lb/> employment. Since
                    the shock which their fortune <reg orig="sustain-|ed">sustained</reg>, <lb/> by
                    Watson's disappearance, she has been permitted to <lb/> pursue this plan, and
                    she now teaches music in Baltimore <lb/> for a living. No one, however, in the
                    highest rank, can <lb/> be more generally respected and caressed than she
                    is.</p>
                <p>But will not the recovery of this money make a <reg orig="favora-|ble"
                        >favorable</reg>
                    <lb/> change in her condition?</p>
                <p>I can hardly tell; but I am inclined to think it will not. <lb/> It will not
                    change her mother's character. Her pride may <lb/> be awakened anew, and she may
                    oblige Miss Fanny to <reg orig="re-|linquish">relinquish</reg>
                    <lb/> her new profession, and that will be a change to be <lb/> deplored.</p>
                <p>What good has been done, then, by restoring this <lb/> money?</p>
                <p>If pleasure be good, you must have conferred a great <lb/> deal on the Maurices;
                    upon the mother and two of the <lb/> daughters, at least. The only pleasure,
                    indeed, which their <lb/> natures can receive. It is less than if you had raised
                    them <lb/>
                    <pb n="153" entity="eaf033v2_0362" pid="uva-lib:349669">

                    </pb> from absolute indigence, which has not been the case, since <lb/> they had
                    wherewithal to live upon besides their Jamaica <reg orig="pro-|perty"
                        >property</reg>. <lb/> But how, continued Williams, suddenly recollecting
                    <lb/> himself, have you claimed the reward promised to him who <lb/> should
                    restore these bills?</p>
                <p>What reward?</p>
                <p>No less than a thousand dollars. It was publicly <reg orig="prom-|ised"
                        >promised</reg>
                    <lb/> under the hands of Mrs. Maurice and of <reg orig="Hem-|mings"
                        >Hemmings</reg>, <lb/> her husband's executor.</p>
                <p>Really, said I, that circumstance escaped my attention, <lb/> and I wonder that
                    it did; but is it too late to repair the <lb/> evil?</p>
                <p>Then you have no scruple to accept the reward?</p>
                <p>Certainly not. Could you suspect me of so strange a <lb/> punctilio as that?</p>
                <p>Yes; but I know not why. The story you have just <reg orig="fin-|ished"
                        >finished</reg>
                    <lb/> taught me to expect some unreasonable refinement <lb/> upon that
                    head.&mdash;To be hired, to be bribed to do our duty <lb/> is supposed by some
                    to be degrading.</p>
                <p>This is no such bribe to me. I should have acted just <lb/> as I have done, had
                    no recompense been promised. In <lb/> truth, this has been my conduct, for I
                    never once thought <lb/> of the reward; but now that you remind me of it, I
                    <lb/> would gladly see it bestowed. To fulfil their engagements, <lb/> in this
                    respect, is no more than justice in the Maurices. To <lb/> one, in my condition,
                    the money will he highly useful. If <lb/> these people were poor, or generous
                    and worthy, or if I <reg orig="my-|self">myself</reg>
                    <lb/> were already rich, I might less repine at their <reg orig="with-|holding"
                        >withholding</reg>
                    <lb/> it; but, things being as they are with them and with <lb/> me, it would, I
                    think be gross injustice in them to withhold, <lb/> and in me to refuse.</p>
                <p>That injustice, said Williams, will, on their part, I fear, <lb/> be committed.
                    'Tis pity you first applied to Mrs. Maurice. <lb/> Nothing can be expected from
                    her avarice, unless it be <lb/> wrested from her by a lawsuit.</p>
                <p>That is a force which I shall never apply.</p>
                <p>Had you gone first to Hemmings, you might, I think, <lb/> have looked for
                    payment. He is not a mean man. A <lb/> thousand dollars he must know is not much
                    to give for <reg orig="for-|ty">forty</reg>
                    <lb/> thousand. Perhaps, indeed, it may not yet be too late. <lb/>
                    <pb n="154" entity="eaf033v2_0363" pid="uva-lib:349670"/> I am well known to
                    him, and if you please, will attend you <lb/> to him in the evening, and state
                    your claim.</p>
                <p>I thankfully accepted this offer, and went with him <reg orig="ac-|cordingly"
                        >accordingly</reg>. <lb/> I found that Hemmings had been with Mrs. <lb/>
                    Maurice in the course of the day; had received from her <lb/> intelligence of
                    this transaction, and had entertained the <reg orig="ex-|pectation"
                        >expectation</reg>
                    <lb/> of a visit from me for this very purpose.</p>
                <p>While Williams explained to him the nature of my claim, <lb/> he scanned me with
                    great intentness. His austere and <reg orig="in-|flexible">inflexible</reg>
                    <lb/> brow, afforded me little room to hope for success, <lb/> and this
                    hopelessness was confirmed by his silence and <reg orig="per-|plexity"
                        >perplexity</reg>, <lb/> when Williams had made an end.</p>
                <p>To be sure, said he, after some pause, the contract was <lb/> explicit. To be
                    sure, the conditions on Mr. Mervyn's side <lb/> have been performed. Certain it
                    is, the bills are entire and <lb/> complete, but Mrs. Maurice will not consent
                    to do her part, <lb/> and Mrs. Maurice, to whom the papers were presented, is
                    <lb/> the person, by whom, according to the terms of the contract, <lb/> the
                    reward must be paid.</p>
                <p>But Mrs. Maurice, you know, sir, may be legally <reg orig="compel-|led"
                        >compelled</reg>
                    <lb/> to pay, said Williams.</p>
                <p>Perhaps she may; but I tell you plainly, that she never <lb/> will do the thing
                    without compulsion. Legal process, <reg orig="how-|ever">however</reg>, <lb/> in
                    this case, will have other inconveniences besides <lb/> delay. Some curiosity
                    will naturally be excited, as to the <lb/> history of these papers. Watson
                    disappeared a twelvemonth <lb/> ago. Who can avoid asking, where have these
                    papers been <lb/> deposited all this while, and how came this person in <reg
                        orig="pos-|session">possession</reg>
                    <lb/> of them?</p>
                <p>That kind of curiosity, said I, is natural and laudable, and <lb/> gladly would I
                    gratify it. Disclosure or concealment in that <lb/> case, however, would no wise
                    affect my present claim. <lb/> Whether a bond, legally executed, shall be paid,
                    does not <lb/> depend upon determining whether the payer is fondest of <lb/>
                    boiled mutton or roast beef. Truth, in the first case, has no <lb/> connexion
                    with truth in the second. So far from eluding <lb/> this curiosity; so far from
                    studying concealment, I am <reg orig="anx-|ious">anxious</reg>
                    <lb/> to publish the truth.</p>
                <p>You are right, to be sure, said Hemmings. Curiosity is <lb/> a natural, but only
                    an incidental consequence in this case. I <lb/>
                    <pb n="155" entity="eaf033v2_0364" pid="uva-lib:349671"/> have no reason for
                    desiring that it should be an unpleasant <lb/> consequence to you.</p>
                <p>Well, sir, said Williams, you think that Arthur Mervyn <lb/> has no remedy in
                    this case but the law.</p>
                <p>Mrs. Maurice, to be sure, will never pay but on <reg orig="compul-|sion"
                        >compulsion</reg>. <lb/> Mervyn should have known his own interest better.
                    <lb/> While his left hand was stretched out to give, his right should <lb/> have
                    been held forth to receive. As it is, he must be <reg orig="con-|tented"
                        >contented</reg>
                    <lb/> with the aid of law. Any attorney will prosecute on <lb/> condition of
                    receiving <hi rend="italic">half the sum</hi> when recovered.</p>
                <p>We now rose to take our leave, when, Hemmings <reg orig="desir-|ing"
                        >desiring</reg>

                    the terms of our promise, the reward was to be <lb/> paid by the person who
                    received the papers; but it must be <lb/> owned that your claim, at any rate, is
                    equitable. I have <lb/> money of the deceased Mr. Maurice in my hands. These
                    <lb/> very bills are now in my possession. I will therefore pay <lb/> you your

                    <lb/> on myself. I was prepared for you. Sign that receipt, <lb/> and there is a

                    <lb/> and wishes, and professed his willingness to serve <lb/> me.</p>

                    given me competence, <lb/> at least.</p>
                <p>What! call you a thousand dollars competence?</p>
                <p>More than competence. I call it an abundance. My <lb/> own ingenuity, while I
                    enjoy health, will enable me to live. <lb/> This I regard as a fund, first to
                    pay my debts, and next to <lb/> supply deficiencies occasioned by untoward
                    accidents or ill <lb/> health, during the ensuing three or four years, at
                    least.</p>
                <p>We parted with this new acquaintance at a late hour, and <lb/> I accepted
                    Williams' invitation to pass the time I should <lb/> spend at Baltimore, under
                    his sister's roof. There were <lb/> several motives for prolonging this stay.
                    What I had heard <lb/> of Miss Fanny Maurice, excited strong wishes to be <reg
                        orig="person-|ally">personally</reg>
                    <lb/> acquainted with her. This young lady was <reg orig="affection-|ately"
                        >affectionately</reg>
                    <lb/> attached to Mrs. Watson, by whose means my wishes <lb/> were easily
                    accomplished.</p>
                <p>I never was in habits of reserve, even with those whom I <lb/> had no reason to
                    esteem. With those who claimed my <reg orig="ad-|miration">admiration</reg>
                    <lb/> and affection, it was impossible to be <reg orig="incommuni-|cative"
                        >incommunicative</reg>. <lb/> Before the end of my second interview, both
                    these <lb/> women were mistresses of every momentous incident of my <lb/> life,
                    and of the whole chain of my feelings and opinions, in <lb/> relation to every
                    subject, and particularly in relation to <lb/> themselves. Every topic
                    disconnected with these, is <reg orig="com-|paratively">comparatively</reg>
                    <lb/> lifeless and inert.</p>
                <p>I found it easy to win their attention, and to render them <lb/> communicative in
                    their turn. As full disclosures as I had <lb/> made without condition or
                    request, my inquiries and <reg orig="exam-|ple">example</reg>
                    <lb/> easily obtained from Mrs. Watson and Miss Maurice. <lb/> The former
                    related every event of her youth, and the <reg orig="cir-|cumstances"
                        >circumstances</reg>
                    <lb/> leading to her marriage. She depicted the <lb/> character of her husband,
                    and the whole train of suspenses <lb/> and inquietudes occasioned by his
                    disappearance. The <lb/> latter did not hide from me her opinions upon any
                    important <lb/> subject, and made me thoroughly acquainted with her <reg
                        orig="ac-|tual">actual</reg>
                    <lb/> situation.</p>
                <p>This intercourse was strangely fascinating. My heart <lb/> was buoyed up by a
                    kind of intoxication. I now found <reg orig="my-|self">myself</reg>
                    <lb/> exalted to my genial element, and began to taste the <lb/> delights of
                    existence. In the intercourse of ingenuous and <lb/>

                    </pb> sympathetic minds, I found a pleasure which I had not <reg
                        orig="pre-|viously">previously</reg>
                    <lb/> conceived.</p>
                <p>The time flew swiftly away, and a fortnight passed <reg orig="al-|most"
                        >almost</reg>
                    <lb/> before I was aware that a day had gone by. I did <lb/> not forget the
                    friends whom I had left behind, but <reg orig="main-|tained">maintained</reg>
                    <lb/> a punctual correspondence with Stevens, to whom I <lb/> imparted all
                    occurrences.</p>
                <p>The recovery of my friend's kinsman, allowed him in a <lb/> few days to return
                    home. His first object was the <reg orig="consola-|tion">consolation</reg>
                    <lb/> and relief of Carlton, whom, with much difficulty, he <lb/> persuaded to
                    take advantage of the laws in favor of insolvent <lb/> debtors. Carlton's only
                    debt was owing to his uncle, and <lb/> by rendering up every species of
                    property, except his clothes, <lb/> and the implements of his trade, he obtained
                    a full discharge. <lb/> In conjunction with his sister, he once more assumed the
                    <lb/> pen, and being no longer burthened with debts he was <reg orig="una-|ble"
                        >unable</reg>
                    <lb/> to discharge, he resumed, together with his pen, his <lb/> cheerfulness.
                    Their mutual industry was sufficient for their <lb/> decent and moderate
                    subsistence.</p>
                <p>The chief reason for my hasty return, was my anxiety <lb/> respecting Clemenza
                    Lodi. This reason was removed by <lb/> the activity and benevolence of my
                    friend. He paid this <lb/> unfortunate stranger a visit at Mrs. Villars's.
                    Access was <lb/> easily obtained, and he found her sunk into the deepest <reg
                        orig="mel-|ancholy">melancholy</reg>. <lb/> The recent loss of her child,
                    the death of <reg orig="Wel-|beck">Welbeck</reg>, <lb/> of which she was soon
                    apprized, her total dependence <lb/> upon those with whom she was placed, who,
                    however, had <lb/> always treated her without barbarity or indecorum, were <lb/>
                    the calamities that weighed down her spirits.</p>
                <p>My friend easily engaged her confidence and gratitude, <lb/> and prevailed upon
                    her to take refuge under his own roof. <lb/> Mrs. Wentworth's scruples, as well
                    as those of Mrs. <reg orig="Field-|ing">Fielding</reg>, <lb/> were removed by
                    his arguments and entreaties, and <lb/> they consented to take upon themselves,
                    and divide between <lb/> them, the care of her subsistence and happiness. They
                    <lb/> condescended to express much curiosity respecting me, and <lb/> some
                    interest in my welfare, and promised to receive me on <lb/> my return, on the
                    footing of a friend.</p>
                <p>With some reluctance, I at length bade my new friends <lb/> farewell, and
                    returned to Philadelphia. Nothing remained, <lb/>
                    <pb n="158" entity="eaf033v2_0367" pid="uva-lib:349674"/> before I should enter
                    on my projected scheme of study and <lb/> employment, under the guidance of
                    Stephens, but to <reg orig="exam-|ine">examine</reg>
                    <lb/> the situation of Eliza Hadwin with my own eyes, and if <lb/> possible to
                    extricate my father from his unfortunate <reg orig="situa-|tion"
                    >situation</reg>.</p>
                <p>My father's state had given me the deepest concern. I <lb/> figured to myself his
                    condition, besotted by brutal appetites, <lb/> reduced to beggary, shut up in a
                    noisome prison, and <lb/> condemned to that society which must foster all his
                    depraved <lb/> propensities. I revolved various schemes for his relief. A <lb/>
                    few hundreds would take him from prison, but how should <lb/> he be afterwards
                    disposed of? How should he be cured of <lb/> his indolent habits? How should he
                    be screened from the <lb/> contagion of vicious society? By what means,
                    consistently <lb/> with my own wants, and the claims of others, should I secure
                    <lb/> to him an acceptable subsistence?</p>
                <p>Exhortation and example were vain. Nothing but <reg orig="re-|straint"
                        >restraint</reg>
                    <lb/> would keep him at a distance from the haunts of <lb/> brawling and
                    debauchery. The want of money would be <lb/> no obstacle to prodigality and
                    waste. Credit would be <lb/> resorted to as long as it would answer his demand.
                    When <lb/> that failed, he would once more be thrown into a prison; the <lb/>
                    same means to extricate him would have to be repeated, and <lb/> money be thus
                    put into the pockets of the most worthless of <lb/> mankind, the agents of
                    drunkenness and blasphemy, without <lb/> any permanent advantage to my father,
                    the principal object <lb/> of my charity.</p>
                <p>Though unable to fix on any plausible mode of <reg orig="proceed-|ing"
                        >proceeding</reg>, <lb/> I determined, at least, to discover his present
                    condition. <lb/> Perhaps something might suggest itself, upon the spot, suited
                    <lb/> to my purpose. Without delay I proceeded to the village of <lb/> Newtown,
                    and alighting at the door of the prison, inquired <lb/> for my father.</p>
                <p>Sawny Mervyn you want, I suppose, said the keeper. <lb/> Poor fellow! He came
                    into limbo in a crazy condition, and <lb/> has been a burthen on my hands ever
                    since. After <reg orig="linger-|ing">lingering</reg>
                    <lb/> along for some time, he was at last kind enough to give <lb/> us the slip.
                    It is just a week since he drank his last pint&mdash; <lb/> and <hi
                        rend="italic">died.</hi></p>
                <p>I was greatly shocked at this intelligence. It was some <lb/> time before my
                    reason came to my aid, and shewed me <lb/>
                    <pb n="159" entity="eaf033v2_0368" pid="uva-lib:349675"/> that this was an
                    event, on the whole, and on a disinterested <lb/> and dispassionate view, not
                    unfortunate. The keeper knew <lb/> not my relation to the deceased, and readily
                    recounted the <lb/> behavior of the prisoner and the circumstances of his last
                    <lb/> hours.</p>
                <p>I shall not repeat the narrative. It is useless to keep <lb/> alive the sad
                    remembrance. He was now beyond the reach <lb/> of my charity or pity; and since
                    reflection could answer no <lb/> beneficial end to him, it was my duty to divert
                    my thoughts <lb/> into different channels, and live henceforth for my own <reg
                        orig="hap-|piness">happiness</reg>
                    <lb/> and that of those who were within the sphere of my <lb/> influence.</p>
                <p>I was now alone in the world, so far as the total want of <lb/> kindred creates
                    solitude. Not one of my blood, nor even <lb/> of my name, were to be found in
                    this quarter of the world. <lb/> Of my mother's kindred I knew nothing. So far
                    as <reg orig="friend-|ship">friendship</reg>
                    <lb/> or service might he claimed from them, to me they had <lb/> no existence.
                    I was destitute of all those benefits which <lb/> flow from kindred, in relation
                    to protection, advice or <reg orig="pro-|perty">property</reg>. <lb/> My
                    inheritance was nothing. Not a single relic <lb/> or trinket in my possession
                    constituted a memorial of my <lb/> family. The scenes of my childish and
                    juvenile days were <lb/> dreary and desolate. The fields which I was wont to
                    traverse, <lb/> the room in which I was born, retained no traces of the past.
                    <lb/> They were the property and residence of strangers, who <lb/> knew nothing
                    of the former tenants, and who, as I was now <lb/> told, had hastened to new
                    model and transform every thing <lb/> within and without the habitation.</p>
                <p>These images filled me with melancholy, which, however, <lb/> disappeared in
                    proportion as I approached the abode of my <lb/> beloved girl. Absence had
                    endeared the image of my <lb/>
                    <hi rend="italic">Bess</hi>&mdash;I loved to call her so&mdash;to my soul. I
                    could not think <lb/> of her without a melting softness at my heart, and tears
                    in <lb/> which pain and pleasure were unaccountably mingled. As <lb/> I
                    approached Curling's house, I strained my sight, in hopes <lb/> of
                    distinguishing her form through the evening dusk.</p>
                <p>I had told her of my purpose, by letter. She expected <lb/> my approach at this
                    hour, and was stationed, with a heart <lb/> throbbing with impatience, at the
                    road side, near the gate. <lb/> As soon as I alighted, she rushed into my
                    arms.</p>
                <p>I found my sweet friend less blithesome and contented than <lb/>
                    <pb n="160" entity="eaf033v2_0369" pid="uva-lib:349676"/> I wished. Her
                    situation, in spite of the parental and sisterly <lb/> regards which she
                    received from the Curlings, was <reg orig="mourn-|ful">mournful</reg>
                    <lb/> and dreary to her imagination. Rural business was <reg orig="irk-|some"
                        >irksome</reg>, <lb/> and insufficient to fill up her time. Her life was
                        <reg orig="tire-|some">tiresome</reg>, <lb/> and uniform, and heavy.</p>
                <p>I ventured to blame her discontent, and pointed out the <lb/> advantages of her
                    situation. Whence, said I, can these <reg orig="dis-|satisfactions"
                        >dissatisfactions</reg>
                    <lb/> and repinings arise?</p>
                <p>I cannot tell, said she; I don't know how it is with me. <lb/> I am always
                    sorrowful and thoughtful. Perhaps I think too <lb/> much of my poor father and
                    of Susan, and yet that can't be <lb/> it neither, for I think of them but
                    seldom; not half as much <lb/> as I ought, perhaps. I think of nobody almost but
                    you. <lb/> Instead of minding my business, or chatting and laughing <lb/> with
                    Peggy Curling, I love to get by myself&mdash;to read, over <lb/> and over, your
                    letters, or to think how you are employed <lb/> just then, and how happy I
                    should be if I were in Fanny <lb/> Maurice's place.</p>
                <p>But it is all over now; this visit rewards me for every <lb/> thing. I wonder how
                    I could ever be sullen or mopeful. I <lb/> will behave better, indeed I will,
                    and be always, as now, a <lb/> most happy girl.</p>
                <p>The greater part of three days was spent in the society <lb/> of my friend, in
                    listening to her relation of all that had <reg orig="hap-|pened">happened</reg>
                    <lb/> during my absence, and in communicating, in my <lb/> turn, every incident
                    which had befallen myself. After this <lb/> I once more returned to the
                    city.</p>

                    I <lb/> began with ardent zeal and unwearied diligence the career <lb/> of
                    medical study. I bespoke the counsels and instructions <lb/> of my friend;
                    attended him on his professional visits, and <lb/> acted, in all practicable
                    cases, as his substitute. I found <lb/> this application of time more
                    pleasureable than I had <reg orig="ima-|gined">imagined</reg>. <lb/> My mind
                    gladly expanded itself, as it were, for the <lb/> reception of new ideas. My
                    curiosity grew more eager, in <lb/>
                    <pb n="161" entity="eaf033v2_0370" pid="uva-lib:349677"/> proportion as it was
                    supplied with food, and every day added <lb/> strength to the assurance that I
                    was no insignificant and <lb/> worthless being; that I was destined to be <hi
                        rend="italic">something</hi> in this <lb/> scene of existence, and might
                    some time lay claim to the <lb/> gratitude and homage of my fellow men.</p>
                <p>I was far from being, however, monopolized by these <lb/> pursuits. I was formed
                    on purpose for the gratification of <lb/> social intercourse. To love and to be
                    loved; to exchange <lb/> hearts, and mingle sentiments with all the virtuous and
                        <reg orig="ami-|able">amiable</reg>, <lb/> whom my good fortune had placed
                    within the circuit <lb/> of my knowledge, I always esteemed my highest enjoyment
                    <lb/> and my chief duty.</p>
                <p>Carlton and his sister, Mrs. Wentworth, and Achsa <lb/> Fielding, were my most
                    valuable associates beyond my own <lb/> family. With all these my correspondence
                    was frequent <lb/> and unreserved, but chiefly with the latter. This lady had
                    <lb/> dignity and independence, a generous and enlightened spirit <lb/> beyond
                    what her education had taught me to expect. She <lb/> was circumspect and
                    cautious in her deportment, and was <lb/> not prompt to make advances, or accept
                    them. She <reg orig="with-|held">withheld</reg>
                    <lb/> her esteem and confidence until she had full proof of <lb/> their being
                    deserved.</p>
                <p>I am not sure that her treatment of me was fully <reg orig="con-|formable"
                        >conformable</reg>
                    <lb/> to her rules. My manners, indeed, as she once <lb/> told me, she had never
                    met with in another. Ordinary rules <lb/> were so totally overlooked in my
                    behavior, that it seemed <lb/> impossible for any one who knew me to adhere to
                    them. <lb/> No option was left but to admit my claims to friendship and <lb/>
                    confidence, instantly, or to reject them altogether.</p>
                <p>I was not conscious of this singularity. The internal and <lb/> undiscovered
                    character of another, weighed nothing with me <lb/> in the question, whether
                    they should be treated with <reg orig="frank-|ness">frankness</reg>
                    <lb/> or reserve. I felt no scruple on any occasion, to <reg orig="dis-|close"
                        >disclose</reg>
                    <lb/> every feeling and every event. Any one who could <lb/> listen, found me
                    willing to talk. Every talker found me <lb/> willing to listen. Every one had my
                    sympathy and <reg orig="kind-|ness">kindness</reg>, <lb/>
                    <hi rend="italic">without</hi> claiming it, but I <hi rend="italic">claimed</hi>
                    the kindness and <lb/> sympathy of every one.</p>
                <p>Achsa Fielding's countenance bespoke, I thought, a mind <lb/> worthy to be known
                    and to be loved. The first moment I <lb/> engaged her attention, I told her so.
                    I related the little <lb/>
                    <pb n="162" entity="eaf033v2_0371" pid="uva-lib:349678"/> story of my family,
                    spread out before her all my reasonings <lb/> and determinations, my notions of
                    right and wrong, my fears <lb/> and wishes. All this was done with sincerity and
                    fervor, <lb/> with gestures, actions, and looks, in which I felt as if my <lb/>
                    whole soul was visible. Her superior age, sedateness, and <lb/> prudence, gave
                    my deportment a filial freedom and <reg orig="affec-|tion">affection</reg>,
                    <lb/> and I was fond of calling her "<hi rend="italic">mamma.</hi>"</p>
                <p>I particularly dwelt upon the history of my dear country <lb/> girl; painted her
                    form and countenance; recounted our <lb/> dialogues, and related all my schemes
                    for making her wise, <lb/> and good, and happy. On these occasions my friend
                    <lb/> would listen to me with the mutest attention. I showed <lb/> her the
                    letters I received, and offered her for her perusal, <lb/> those which I wrote
                    in answer, before they were sealed <lb/> and sent.</p>
                <p>On these occasions she would look by turns on my face <lb/> and away from me. A
                    varying hue would play upon her <lb/> cheek, and her eyes were fuller than was
                    common, of <lb/> meaning.</p>
                <p>Such and such, I once said, are my notions; now what <lb/> do <hi rend="italic"
                        >you</hi> think?</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Think!</hi> emphatically, and turning somewhat aside, she <lb/>
                    answered, that you are the most&mdash;<hi rend="italic">strange</hi> of human
                        <reg orig="crea-|tures">creatures</reg>.</p>
                <p>But tell me, I resumed, following and searching her <lb/> averted eyes, am I
                    right; would you do thus? Can you <lb/> help me to improve my girl? I wish you
                    knew the <reg orig="be-|witching">bewitching</reg>
                    <lb/> little creature. How would that heart overflow <lb/> with affection and
                    with gratitude towards you. She should <lb/> be your daughter. No&mdash;you are
                    too nearly of an age <lb/> for that. A sister; her <hi rend="italic">elder</hi>
                    sister, you should be. <lb/>
                    <hi rend="italic">That,</hi> when there is no other relation, includes them all.
                    <lb/> Fond sisters you would be, and I the fond brother of you <lb/> both.</p>
                <p>My eyes glistened as I spoke. In truth, I am in that <lb/> respect, a mere woman.
                    My friend was more powerfully <lb/> moved. After a momentary struggle, she burst
                    into tears.</p>
                <p>Good Heaven! said I, what ails you? Are you not <lb/> well?</p>
                <p>Her looks betrayed an unaccountable confusion, from <lb/> which she quickly
                    recovered.&mdash;It was folly to be thus <reg orig="af-|fected">affected</reg>. <lb/>
                    <pb n="163" entity="eaf033v2_0372" pid="uva-lib:349679"/> Something ailed me, I
                    believe, but it is past.&mdash;But <lb/> come, you want some lines of finishing
                    the description of <lb/> the <hi rend="italic">Boa</hi> in La Cepide.</p>
                <p>True. And I have twenty minutes to spare. Poor <lb/> Franks is very ill indeed,
                    but he cannot be seen till nine. <lb/> We'll read till then.</p>
                <p>Thus on the wings of pleasure and improvement passed my <lb/> time; not without
                    some hues, occasionally of a darker tint. <lb/> My heart was now and then
                    detected in sighing. This <reg orig="oc-|curred">occurred</reg>
                    <lb/> when my thoughts glanced at the poor Eliza, and <lb/> measured, as it
                    were, the interval between us. We are <lb/> too&mdash;<hi rend="italic">too</hi>
                    far apart, thought I.</p>
                <p>The best solace on these occasions, was the company of <lb/> Mrs. Fielding; her
                    music, her discourse, or some book <lb/> which she set me to rehearsing to her.
                    One evening, when <lb/> preparing to pay her a visit, I received the following
                    letter <lb/> from my Bess.</p>
                <ornament type="line"/>

                        in my heart to do <lb/> you. You treat me cruelly. I must say so, though I
                        offend <lb/> you. I must write, though you do not deserve that I should,
                        <lb/> and though I fear I am in a humor not very fit for writing. <lb/> I
                        had better go to my chamber and weep; weep at your <lb/> &mdash;<hi
                            rend="italic">unkindness,</hi> I was going to say; but, perhaps, it is
                        only <lb/> forgetfulness; and yet what can be more unkind than <reg

                        forgotten you. Sleep <lb/> itself, which wraps all other images in
                        forgetfulness, only <lb/> brings you nearer, and makes me see you more
                        distinctly.</p>
                    <p>But where can this letter stay?&mdash;O! that&mdash;hush! foolish <lb/> girl!
                        If a word of that kind escape thy lips, Arthur will be <lb/> angry with
                        thee; and then, indeed, thou mightest weep in <lb/> earnest. <hi

                        <lb/> More than once already has he almost broken thy heart <lb/>
                        <pb n="164" entity="eaf033v2_0373" pid="uva-lib:349680"/> with his
                        reproaches. Sore and weak as it now is, any new <lb/> reproaches would
                        assuredly break it quite.</p>
                    <p>I <hi rend="italic">will</hi> be content. I will be as good a housewife and
                        <lb/> dairy-woman, stir about as briskly, and sing as merrily as <lb/> Peggy
                        Curling. Why not? I am as young, as innocent, <lb/> and enjoy as good
                        health. Alas! she has reason to be <lb/> merry. She has father, mother,
                        brothers; but I have none. <lb/> And he that was all these, and more than
                        all these, to me, <lb/> has&mdash;<hi rend="italic">forgotten</hi> me.</p>
                    <p>But, perhaps, it is some accident that hinders. Perhaps <lb/> Oliver left the
                        market earlier than he used to do; or you <lb/> mistook the house; or,
                        perhaps, some poor creature was <lb/> sick, was taken suddenly ill, and you
                        were busy in chafing <lb/> his clay-cold limbs; it fell to you to wipe the
                        clammy drops <lb/> from his brow. Such things often happen; don't they,
                        <lb/> Arthur, to people of your trade, and some such thing has <lb/>
                        happened now; and that was the reason you did not write.</p>
                    <p>And if so, shall I repine at your silence? O no! At such <lb/> a time the
                        poor Bess might easily be, and ought to be <reg orig="for-|gotten"
                            >forgotten</reg>. <lb/> She would not deserve your love, if she could
                        <lb/> repine at a silence brought about this way.</p>
                    <p>And O! May it be so! May there be nothing worse than <lb/> this. If the sick

                        What is always bad, my fears <lb/> make worse than ever.</p>
                    <p>I must not think that. And yet, if it be so, if my friend <lb/> himself be
                        sick, what will become of me? Of me, that <lb/> ought to cherish you and
                        comfort you; that ought to be <lb/> your nurse. Endure for you your
                        sickness, when she <reg orig="can-|not">cannot</reg>
                        <lb/> remove it.</p>
                    <p>O! that&mdash;&mdash;I <hi rend="italic">will</hi> speak out&mdash;O! that
                        this strange <reg orig="scru-|ple">scruple</reg>
                        <lb/> had never possessed you. Why should I <hi rend="italic">not</hi> be

                        deprive yourself of such a comforter, and such an <lb/> aid as I would be to
                        you?</p>
                    <p>Dear Arthur, think better of it. Let me leave this dreary <lb/> spot, where,
                        indeed, as long as I am thus alone, I can enjoy <lb/> no comfort. Let me
                        come to you. I will put up with any <lb/> thing for the sake of seeing you,
                        though it be but once a <lb/> day. Any garret or cellar in the dirtiest lane

                        prize your company, I would not ask <lb/> it, if I thought there was any
                        thing improper. You say there <lb/> is, and you talk about it in a way that
                        I do not understand. <lb/> For my sake, you tell me, you refuse, but let me
                        entreat <lb/> you to comply for my sake.</p>
                    <p>Your pen cannot teach me like your tongue. You write <lb/> me long letters,
                        and tell me a great deal in them, but my <lb/> soul droops when I call to
                        mind your voice and your looks, <lb/> and think how long a time must pass
                        before I see you and <lb/> hear you again. I have no spirit to think upon
                        the words <lb/> and paper before me. My eye and my thought wander far <lb/>
                        away.</p>
                    <p>I bethink me how many questions I might ask you; how <lb/> many doubts you
                        might clear up if you were but within <reg orig="hear-|ing">hearing</reg>.
                        <lb/> If you were but close to me; but I cannot ask them <lb/> here. I am
                        too poor a creature at the pen, and, somehow <lb/> or another, it always
                        happens, I can only write about myself <lb/> or about you. By the time I
                        have said all this, I have tired <lb/> my fingers, and when I set about
                        telling you how this poem <lb/> and that story have affected me, I am at a
                        loss for words; I <lb/> am bewildered and bemazed as it were.</p>
                    <p>It is not so when we talk to one another. With your arm <lb/> about me, and
                        your sweet face close to mine, I can prattle <lb/> forever. Then my heart
                        overflows at my lips. After hours <lb/> thus spent, it seems as if there
                        were a thousand things still <lb/> to be said. Then I can tell you what the
                        book has told me. <lb/> I can repeat scores of verses by heart, though I
                        heard them <lb/> only once read, but it is because <hi rend="italic"
                            >you</hi> have read them to me.</p>
                    <p>Then there is nobody here to answer my questions. <lb/> They never look into
                        books. They hate books. They <lb/> think it waste of time to read. Even
                        Peggy, who you say <lb/> has naturally a strong mind, wonders what I can
                        find to <lb/> amuse myself in a book. In her playful mood, she is always
                        <lb/> teazing me to lay it aside.</p>
                    <p>I do not mind her, for I like to read; but if I did not like <lb/> it before,
                        I could not help doing so ever since you told me <lb/>
                        <pb n="166" entity="eaf033v2_0375" pid="uva-lib:349682"/> that nobody could

                        that account, more than I did, I <lb/> don't read somehow so earnestly, and
                        understand so well as <lb/> I use to do, when my mind was all at ease;

                            >wise</hi> to be happy?</p>
                    <p>I am now <hi rend="italic">so</hi> grave. Not one smile can Peggy sometimes
                        <lb/> get from me, though she tries for it the whole day. But I <lb/> know
                        how it comes. Strange, indeed, if losing father and <lb/> sister, and thrown
                        upon the wide world, pennyless and <hi rend="italic"><reg

                        <lb/> too, now that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> forget me; I should continue
                        to smile. <lb/> No. I never shall smile again. At least, while I stay here,
                        <lb/> I never shall, I believe.</p>

                        perhaps the sound of his voice, asking&mdash;"where is my <lb/>
                        Bess?"&mdash;might produce a smile. Such a one as the very <lb/> thought
                        produces now&mdash;yet not, I hope, so transient, and so <lb/> quickly
                        followed by a tear. Women are born, they say, <lb/> to trouble, and tears
                        are given them for their relief. 'Tis <lb/> all very true.</p>

                <p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> reading of this letter, though it made me
                    mournful, <lb/> did not hinder me from paying the visit I intended. My <lb/>
                    friend noticed my discomposure.</p>
                <pb n="167" entity="eaf033v2_0376" pid="uva-lib:349683"/>
                <p>What, Arthur, thou art quite the "penseroso" to night. <lb/> Come, let me cheer
                    thee with a song. Thou shalt have thy <lb/> favorite ditty.&mdash;She stepped to
                    the instrument, and with <lb/> more than airy lightness, touched and sung:</p>
                <lg>
                    <l>Now knit hands and beat the ground</l>
                    <l>In a light, fantastic round,</l>
                    <l>Till the tell-tale sun descry</l>
                    <l>Our conceal'd solemnity.</l>
                </lg>
                <p>Her music, though blithesome and aerial, was not sufficient <lb/> for the end. My
                    cheerfulness would not return even at her <lb/> bidding. She again noticed my
                    sedateness, and inquired <lb/> into the cause.</p>
                <p>This girl of mine, said I, has infected me with her own <lb/> sadness. There is a
                    letter I have just received&mdash;she took <lb/> it and began to read.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, I placed myself before her, and fixed my eyes <lb/> steadfastly upon
                    her features. There is no book in which I <lb/> read with more pleasure, than
                    the face of woman. <hi rend="italic">That</hi> is <lb/> generally more full of
                    meaning, and of better meaning too, <lb/> than the hard and inflexible
                    lineaments of man, and <hi rend="italic">this</hi>
                    <lb/> woman's face has no paraliel.</p>
                <p>She read it with visible emotion. Having gone through <lb/> it, she did not lift
                    her eye from the paper, but continued <lb/> silent, as if buried in thought.
                    After some time, for I <lb/> would not interrupt the pause, she addressed me
                    thus;</p>
                <p>This girl seems to be very anxious to be with you.</p>
                <p>As much as I am that she should be so.&mdash;My friend's <lb/> countenance
                    betrayed some perplexity. As soon as I <reg orig="per-|ceived">perceived</reg>
                    <lb/> it, I said, why are you thus grave? Some little <reg orig="con-|fusion"
                        >confusion</reg>, <lb/> appeared, as if she would not have her gravity <lb/>
                    discovered. There again, said I, new tokens in your face, <lb/> my good mamma,
                    of something which you will not mention. <lb/> Yet, sooth to say, this is not
                    your first perplexity. I have <lb/> noticed it before, and wondered. It happens
                    only when my <lb/>
                    <hi rend="italic">Bess</hi> is introduced. Something in relation to her it must
                    <lb/> be, but what I cannot imagine. Why does <hi rend="italic">her</hi> name,
                        <reg orig="par-|ticularly">particularly</reg>, <lb/> make you thoughtful;
                    disturbed; dejected?&mdash; <lb/> There now&mdash;but I must know the reason.
                    You don't agree <lb/> with me in my notions of this girl, I fear, and you will
                    not <lb/> disclose your thoughts.</p>
                <pb n="168" entity="eaf033v2_0377" pid="uva-lib:349684"/>
                <p>By this time, she had gained her usual composure, and <lb/> without noticing my
                    comments on her looks, said; since <lb/> you are both of one mind, why does she
                    not leave the <lb/> country?</p>
                <p>That cannot be, I believe. Mrs. Stevens says it would <lb/> be disreputable. I am
                    no proficient in etiquette, and must, <lb/> therefore, in affairs of this kind,
                    be guided by those who are. <lb/> But would to Heaven, I were truly her father
                    or brother. <lb/> Then all difficulties would be done away.</p>
                <p>Can you seriously wish that?</p>
                <p>Why no. I believe it would be more rational to wish <lb/> that the world would
                    suffer me to act the fatherly or brotherly <lb/> part, without the
                    relationship.</p>
                <p>And is that the only part you wish to act towards this <lb/> girl?</p>
                <p>Certainly, the only part.</p>
                <p>You surprise me. Have you not confessed your love <lb/> for her?</p>
                <p>I <hi rend="italic">do</hi> love her. There is nothing upon earth more dear to
                    <lb/> me than my <hi rend="italic">Bess.</hi></p>
                <p>But love is of different kinds. She was loved by her <lb/> father&mdash;</p>
                <p>Less than by me. He was a good man, but not of lively <lb/> feelings. Besides, he
                    had another daughter, and they shared <lb/> his love between them, but she has
                    no sister to share <hi rend="italic">my</hi>
                    <lb/> love. Calamity too, has endeared her to me; I am all her <lb/>
                    consolation, dependence and hope, and nothing, surely, can <lb/> induce me to
                    abandon her.</p>
                <p>Her reliance upon you, for happiness, replied my friend, <lb/> with a sigh, is
                    plain enough.</p>
                <p>It is; but why that sigh? And yet I understand it. It <lb/> remonstrates with me
                    on my incapacity for her support. I <lb/> know it well, but it is wrong to be
                    cast down. I have youth, <lb/> health and spirits, and ought not to despair of
                    living for my <lb/> own benefit and hers; but you sigh again, and it is <reg
                        orig="impossi-|ble">impossible</reg>
                    <lb/> to keep my courage when <hi rend="italic">you</hi> sigh. Do tell me what
                    <lb/> you mean by it?</p>
                <p>You partly guessed the cause. She trusts to you for <lb/> happiness, but I
                    somewhat suspect she trusts in vain.</p>
                <p>In vain! I beseech you tell me why you think so.</p>

                </pb>
                <p>You say you love her&mdash;why then not make her your <lb/> wife?</p>
                <p>My wife! Surely her extreme youth, and my destitute <lb/> condition, will account
                    for that.</p>
                <p>She is fifteen; the age of delicate fervor; of inartificial <lb/> love, and
                    suitable enough for marriage. As to your <reg orig="con-|dition"
                    >condition</reg>, <lb/> you may live more easily together than apart. She <lb/>
                    has no false taste or perverse desires to gratify. She has <lb/> been trained in
                    simple modes and habits. Besides, that <lb/> objection can be removed another
                    way. But are these all <lb/> your objections?</p>
                <p>Her youth I object to, merely in connexion with her mind. <lb/> She is too little
                    improved to be my wife. She wants that <lb/> solidity of mind; that maturity of
                    intelligence which ten <lb/> years more may possibly give her, but which she
                    cannot <lb/> have at this age.</p>
                <p>Yor are a very prudential youth; then you are willing to <lb/> wait ten years for
                    a wife?</p>
                <p>Does that follow? Because my Bess will not be qualified <lb/> for wedlock, in
                    less time, does it follow that I must wait <lb/> for her?</p>
                <p>I spoke on the supposition that you loved her.</p>
                <p>And that is true; but love is satisfied with studying her <lb/> happiness as her
                    father or brother. Some years hence, <reg orig="per-|haps">perhaps</reg>
                    <lb/> in half a year, for this passion, called wedded, or <lb/>
                    <hi rend="italic">marriage-wishing</hi> love, is of sudden growth, my mind may
                    <lb/> change, and nothing may content me but to have Bess for <lb/> my wife. Yet
                    I do not expect it.</p>
                <p>Then you are determined against marriage with this girl.</p>
                <p>Of course; until that love comes which I feel not now; <lb/> but which, no doubt,
                    will come, when Bess has had the <lb/> benefit of five or eight years more,
                    unless previously <reg orig="ex-|cited">excited</reg>
                    <lb/> by another.</p>
                <p>All this is strange, Arthur. I have heretofore supposed <lb/> that you actually
                    loved (I mean with the <hi rend="italic">marriage-seeking</hi>
                    <lb/> passion) your <hi rend="italic">Bess.</hi></p>
                <p>I believe I once did; but it happened at a time when <lb/> marriage was improper;
                    in the life of her father and sister, <lb/> and when I had never known in what
                    female excellence <lb/> consisted. Since that time my happier to has cast me <lb/>
                    <pb n="170" entity="eaf033v2_0379" pid="uva-lib:349686"/> among women so far
                    above Eliza Hadwin; so far above, <lb/> and so widely different from any thing
                    which time is likely <lb/> to make her, that I own, nothing appears more
                    unlikely than <lb/> that I shall ever love her.</p>
                <p>Are you not a little capricious in that respect, my good <lb/> friend? You have
                    praised your <hi rend="italic">Bess</hi> as rich in natural <reg
                        orig="en-|dowments">endowments</reg>; <lb/> as having an artless purity and
                    rectitude of mind, <lb/> which somewhat supersedes the use of formal education;
                    <lb/> as being full of sweetness and tenderness, and in her <reg orig="per-|son"
                        >person</reg>
                    <lb/> a very angel of loveliness.</p>
                <p>All that is true. I never saw features and shape so <reg orig="deli-|cately"
                        >delicately</reg>
                    <lb/> beautiful; I never knew so young a mind so quick <lb/> sighted and so
                    firm; but, nevertheless, she is not the <reg orig="crea-|ture">creature</reg>
                    <lb/> whom I would call my <hi rend="italic">wife.</hi> My bosom slave; <reg

                    the tutress of my <lb/> children must be a different creature.</p>
                <p>But what are the attributes of this <hi rend="italic">desirable</hi> which Bess
                    <lb/> wants?</p>
                <p>Every thing she wants. Age, capacity, acquirements, <lb/> person, features, hair,
                    complexion, all, all are different <lb/> from this girl's.</p>
                <p>And pray of what kind may they be?</p>
                <p>I cannot portray them in words&mdash;but yes, I can:&mdash;The <lb/> creature
                    whom I shall worship:&mdash;it sounds oddly, but, I <lb/> verily believe, the
                    sentiment which I shall feel for my wife, <lb/> will be more akin to worship
                    than any thing else. I shall <lb/> never love, but such a creature as I now
                    image to myself, <lb/> and <hi rend="italic">such</hi> a creature will deserve,
                    or almost deserve, worship <lb/> &mdash;but this creature, I was going to say,

                        >yourself.</hi></p>
                <p>This was said very earnestly, and with eyes and manners <lb/> that fully

                    <lb/> were unwittingly strong and emphatic, for she started <lb/> and blushed,
                    but the cause of her discomposure, whatever <lb/> it was, was quickly removed,
                    and she said;</p>
                <p>Poor Bess! This will be sad news to thee!</p>
                <p>Heaven forbid! said I, of what moment can my opinions <lb/> be to her?</p>
                <p>Strange questioner that thou art. Thou knowest that her <lb/> gentle heart is
                    touched with love. See how it shews itself <lb/>
                    <pb n="171" entity="eaf033v2_0380" pid="uva-lib:349687"/> in the tender and
                    inimitable strain of this epistle. Does <lb/> not this sweet ingenuousness
                    bewitch you?</p>
                <p>It does so, and I love, beyond expression, the sweet girl; <lb/> but my love is
                    in some inconceivable way, different from the <lb/> passion which that <hi
                        rend="italic">other</hi> creature will produce. She is no <lb/> stranger to
                    my thoughts. I will impart every thought over <lb/> and over to her. I question
                    not but I shall make her happy <lb/> without forfeiting my own.</p>
                <p>Would marriage with her, be a forfeiture of your <reg orig="hap-|piness"
                        >happiness</reg>?</p>
                <p>Not absolutely, or forever, I believe. I love her <reg orig="com-|pany"
                        >company</reg>. <lb/> Her absence for a long time is irksome. I cannot <lb/>
                    express the delight with which I see and hear her. To <lb/> mark her features,
                    beaming with vivacity; playful in her <lb/> pleasures; to hold her in my arms,
                    and listen to her <reg orig="prat-|tle">prattle</reg>; <lb/> always musically
                    voluble; always sweetly tender, or <lb/> artlessly intelligent&mdash;and this
                    you will say is the dearest <lb/> privilege of marriage; and so it is; and
                    dearly should I <lb/> prize it; and yet, I fear my heart would droop as often as
                    <lb/> that <hi rend="italic">other</hi> image should occur to my fancy. For
                    then, you <lb/> know, it would occur as something never to be possessed <lb/> by
                    me.</p>
                <p>Now this image might, indeed, seldom occur. The <reg orig="in-|tervals"
                        >intervals</reg>, <lb/> at least, would be serene. It would be my <reg
                        orig="inter-|est">interest</reg>
                    <lb/> to prolong these intervals as much as possible, and my <lb/> endeavors to
                    this end, would, no doubt, have some effect. <lb/> Besides, the bitterness of
                    this reflection would be lessened <lb/> by contemplating, at the same time, the
                    happiness of my <lb/> beloved girl.</p>
                <p>I should likewise have to remember, that to continue <lb/> unmarried, would not
                    necessarily secure me the possession <lb/> of the <hi rend="italic">other</hi>
                    good&mdash;</p>
                <p>But these reflections, my friend (broke she in upon me) <lb/> are of as much
                    force to induce you to marry, as to <reg orig="recon-|cile">reconcile</reg>
                    <lb/> you to a marriage already contracted.</p>
                <p>Perhaps they are. Assuredly, I have not a hope that <lb/> the <hi rend="italic"
                        >fancied</hi> excellence will ever be mine. Such happiness <lb/> is not the
                    lot of humanity, and is, least of all, within my <lb/> reach.</p>
                <p>Your diffidence, replied my friend, in a timorous <reg orig="ac-|cent"
                        >accent</reg>, <lb/> has not many examples; but your character, without <lb/>
                    <pb n="172" entity="eaf033v2_0381" pid="uva-lib:349688"/> doubt, is all your
                    own, possessing all and disclaiming all, is, <lb/> in few words, your
                    picture.</p>
                <p>I scarcely understand you. Do you think I ever shall <lb/> be happy to that
                    degree which I have imagined. Think <lb/> you I shall ever meet with an exact
                    copy of <hi rend="italic">yourself?</hi></p>
                <p>Unfortunate you will be, if you do not meet with many <lb/> better. Your Bess, in
                    personals, is, beyond measure, <hi rend="italic">my</hi>
                    <lb/> superior, and in mind, allowing for difference in years, <lb/> quite as
                    much so.</p>
                <p>But that, returned I, with quickness and fervor, is not <lb/> the object. The
                    very counterpart of <hi rend="italic">you</hi> I want; neither <lb/> worse nor
                    better, nor different in any thing. Just such <lb/> form, such features, such
                    hues. Just that melting voice, <lb/> and above all, the same habits of thinking
                    and conversing. <lb/> In thought, word, and deed; gesture, look and form, that
                    <lb/> rare and precious creature whom I shall love, must be your <lb/>
                    resemblance. Your&mdash;</p>
                <p>Have done with these comparisons, interrupted she, in <lb/> some hurry, and let
                    us return to the country girl, thy Bess.</p>
                <p>You once, my friend, wished me to treat this girl of yours <lb/> as my sister. Do
                    you know what the duties of a sister are?</p>
                <p>They imply no more kindness or affection than you <reg orig="al-|ready"
                        >already</reg>
                    <lb/> feel toward thy Bess. Are you not her sister?</p>
                <p>I ought to have been so. I ought to have been proud of <lb/> the relation you
                    ascribe to me, but I have not performed <lb/> any of its duties. I blush to
                    think upon the coldness and <lb/> perverseness of my heart. With such means as I
                    possess, <lb/> of giving happiness to others, I have been thoughtless and <lb/>
                    inactive to a strange degree; perhaps, however, it is not <lb/> yet too late.
                    Are you still willing to invest me with all the <lb/> rights of an elder sister
                    over this girl? And will she consent, <lb/> think you?</p>
                <p>Certainly, she will; she has.</p>
                <p>Then the first act of sistership, will be to take her from <lb/> the country;
                    from persons on whose kindness she has no <lb/> natural claim, whose manners and
                    characters are unlike her <lb/> own, and with whom no improvement can be
                    expected, and <lb/> bring her back to her sister's house and bosom, to provide
                    <lb/> for her subsistence and education, and watch over her <reg
                        orig="hap-|piness">happiness</reg>.</p>
                <p>I will not be a nominal sister. I will not be a sister by <lb/>
                    <pb n="173" entity="eaf033v2_0382" pid="uva-lib:349689"/> halves. <hi
                        rend="italic">All</hi> the rights of that relation I will have, or none.
                    <lb/> As for you, you have claims upon her, on which I must be <lb/> permitted
                    to judge, as becomes the elder sister, who, by the <lb/> loss of all other
                    relations, must occupy the place, possess the <lb/> rights, and fulfil the
                    duties of father, mother and brother.</p>
                <p>She has now arrived at an age, when longer to remain in <lb/> a cold and churlish
                    soil, will stunt her growth and wither her <lb/> blossoms. We must hasten to
                    transplant her to a genial <lb/> element, and a garden well enclosed. Having so
                    long <lb/> neglected this charming plant, it becomes me henceforth to <lb/> take
                    her wholly to myself.</p>
                <p>And now, for it is no longer in her or your power to take <lb/> back the gift,
                    since she is fully mine, I will charge you with <lb/> the office of conducting
                    her hither. I grant it to you as a <lb/> favor. Will you go?</p>
                <p>Go! I will fly! I exclaimed, in an ecstacy of joy, on <lb/> pinions swifter than
                    the wind. Not the lingering of an instant <lb/> will I bear. Look! one, two,
                    three&mdash;thirty minutes after <lb/> nine. I will reach Curling's gate by the
                    morn's dawn. I <lb/> will put my girl into a chaise, and by noon, she shall
                    throw <lb/> herself into the arms of her sister. But first, shall I not, in
                    <lb/> some way, manifest my gratitude?</p>
                <p>My senses were bewildered, and I knew not what I did. <lb/> I intended to kneel,
                    as to my mother or my deity, but, <reg orig="in-|stead">instead</reg>
                    <lb/> of that, I clasped her in my arms, and kissed her lips <lb/> fervently. I
                    stayed not to discover the effects of this <reg orig="insan-|ity"
                    >insanity</reg>, <lb/> but left the room and the house, and calling for a <reg
                        orig="mo-|ment">moment</reg>
                    <lb/> at Stevens', left word with the servant, my friend being <lb/> gone
                    abroad, that I should not return till the morrow.</p>
                <p>Never was a lighter heart, a gaiety more overflowing, and <lb/> more buoyant than
                    mine. All cold from a boisterous night, <lb/> at a chilly season, all weariness
                    from a rugged and miry <lb/> road, were charmed away. I might have ridden, but I
                    <lb/> could not brook delay, even the delay of inquiring for and <lb/> equipping
                    a horse. I might thus have saved myself fatigue, <lb/> and have lost no time,
                    but my mind was in too great a <reg orig="tu-|mult">tumult</reg>
                    <lb/> for deliberation and forecast. I saw nothing but the <lb/> image of my
                    girl, whom my tidings would render happy.</p>
                <p>The way was longer than my fond imagination had <reg orig="fore-|seen"
                        >foreseen</reg>. <lb/> I did not reach Curling's till an hour after sunrise.
                    <lb/> The distance was full thirty-five miles. As I hastened up <lb/>
                    <pb n="174" entity="eaf033v2_0383" pid="uva-lib:349690"/> the green lane leading
                    to the house, I spied my Bess <reg orig="pass-|ing">passing</reg>
                    <lb/> through a covered way, between the dwelling and kitchen. <lb/> I caught
                    her eye. She stopped and held up her hands, and <lb/> then ran into my arms.</p>
                <p>What means my girl? Why this catching of the breath? <lb/> Why this sobbing? Look
                    at me, my love. It is Arthur, he <lb/> who has treated you with forgetfulness,
                    neglect, and <reg orig="cru-|elty">cruelty</reg>.</p>
                <p>O! do not, she replied, hiding her face with her hand. <lb/> One single reproach,
                    added to my own, will kill me. That <lb/> foolish, wicked letter&mdash;I could
                    tear my fingers for writing it.</p>
                <p>But, said I, I will kiss them&mdash;and put them to my lips. <lb/> They have told
                    me the wishes of my girl. They have <reg orig="en-|abled">enabled</reg>
                    <lb/> me to gratify her wishes. I have come to carry thee <lb/> this very moment
                    to town.</p>
                <p>Lord bless me, Arthur&mdash;said she, lost in a sweet <reg orig="confu-|sion"
                        >confusion</reg>, <lb/> and her cheeks, always glowing, glowing still more
                    <lb/> deeply&mdash;indeed, I did not mean&mdash;I meant only&mdash;I <lb/> will
                    stay here&mdash;I would rather stay&mdash;</p>
                <p>It grieves me to hear that, said I, with earnestness, I <lb/> thought I was
                    studying our mutual happiness.</p>
                <p>It grieves you? Don't say so. I would not grieve you <lb/> for the
                    world&mdash;but, indeed, indeed, it is too soon. Such a <lb/> girl as I, am not
                    yet fit to&mdash;live in your city. Again she <lb/> hid her glowing face in my
                    bosom.</p>
                <p>Sweet consciousness! Heavenly innocence! thought I; <lb/> may Achsa's conjectures
                    prove false!&mdash;You have mistaken <lb/> my design, for I do not intend to
                    carry you to town with <lb/> such a view as you have hinted&mdash;but merely to
                    place you <lb/> with a beloved friend; with Achsa Fielding, of whom <lb/>
                    already you know so much, where we shall enjoy each <lb/> other's company
                    without restraint or intermission.</p>
                <p>I then proceeded to disclose to her the plan suggested by <lb/> my friend, and to
                    explain all the consequences that would <lb/> flow from it. I need not say that
                    she assented to the scheme. <lb/> She was all rapture and gratitude.
                    Preparations for <reg orig="de-|parture">departure</reg>
                    <lb/> were easily and speedily made. I hired a chaise of <lb/> a neighboring
                    farmer, and, according to my promise, by <lb/> noon the same day, delivered the
                    timid and bashful girl into <lb/> the arms of her new sister.</p>
                <p>She was received with the utmost tenderness, not only <lb/>
                    <pb n="175" entity="eaf033v2_0384" pid="uva-lib:349691"/> by Mrs. Fielding, but
                    by all my friends. Her affectionate <lb/> heart was encouraged to pour forth all
                    its feeling as into the <lb/> bosom of a mother. She was reinspired with
                    confidence. <lb/> Her want of experience was supplied by the gentlest <reg
                        orig="admo-|nitions">admonitions</reg>
                    <lb/> and instructions. In every plan for her <reg orig="improve-|ment"
                        >improvement</reg>, <lb/> suggested by her new <hi rend="italic">mamma,</hi>
                    for she never called <lb/> her by any other name, she engaged with docility and
                        <reg orig="ea-|gerness">eagerness</reg>; <lb/> and her behavior and her
                    progress exceeded the <lb/> most sanguine hopes that I had formed, as to the
                    softness <lb/> of her temper and the acuteness of her genius.</p>
                <p>Those graces which a polished education, and intercourse <lb/> with the better
                    classes of society, are adapted to give, my <lb/> girl possessed, in some
                    degree, by a native and intuitive <reg orig="re-|finement">refinement</reg>
                    <lb/> and sagacity of mind. All that was to be obtained <lb/> from actual
                    observation and instruction, was obtained <reg orig="with-|out">without</reg>
                    <lb/> difficulty; and in a short time, nothing but the <reg
                        orig="affection-|ate">affectionate</reg>
                    <lb/> simplicity and unperverted feelings of the country girl, <lb/> bespoke the
                    original condition.&mdash;</p>
                <p>What art so busy about, Arthur? Always at thy pen of <lb/> late. Come, I must
                    know the fruit of all this toil and all this <lb/> meditation. I am determined
                    to scrape acquaintance with <lb/> Haller and Lin&aelig;us. I will begin this
                    very day. All one's <lb/> friends you know should be our's. Love has made many a
                    <lb/> patient, and let me see if it cannot, in my case, make a <lb/> physician.
                    But first, what is all this writing about?</p>
                <p>Mrs. Wentworth has put me upon a strange task&mdash;not <lb/> disagreeable,
                    however, but such as I should, perhaps, have <lb/> declined, had not the absence
                    of my Bess, and her mamma, <lb/> made the time hang somewhat heavy. I have,
                    oftener than <lb/> once, and far more circumstantially than now, told her my
                    <lb/> adventures, but she is not satisfied. She wants a written <lb/> narrative,
                    for some purpose which she tells me she will <reg orig="dis-|close"
                        >disclose</reg>
                    <lb/> to me hereafter.</p>
                <p>Luckily, my friend Stevens has saved me more than half <lb/> the trouble. He has
                    done me the favor to compile much of <lb/> my history with his own hand. I
                    cannot imagine what <lb/> could prompt him to so wearisome an undertaking; but
                    he <lb/> says that adventures and a destiny so singular as mine, ought <lb/> not
                    to be abandoned to forgetfulness like any vulgar and <lb/>
                    <hi rend="italic">every-day</hi> existence. Besides, when he wrote it, he <reg
                        orig="sus-|pected">suspected</reg>
                    <lb/> that it might be necessary to the safety of my <reg orig="repu-|tation"
                        >reputation</reg>
                    <lb/>
                    <pb n="176" entity="eaf033v2_0385" pid="uva-lib:349692"/> and my life, from the
                    consequences of my connexion <lb/> with Welbeck. Time has annihilated that
                    danger. All <lb/> enmities and all suspicions are buried with that ill-fated
                    <lb/> wretch. Wortley has been won by my behavior, and <reg orig="con-|fides"
                        >confides</reg>
                    <lb/> in my integrity now as much as he formerly suspected <lb/> it. I am glad,
                    however, that the task was performed. It <lb/> has saved me a world of writing.
                    I had only to take up the <lb/> broken thread, and bring it down to the period
                    of my <reg orig="pre-|sent">present</reg>
                    <lb/> happiness, and this was done, just as you tripped along <lb/> the entry
                    this morning.</p>
                <p>To bed, my friend, it is late, and this delicate frame is <lb/> not half so able
                    to encounter fatigue as a youth spent in the <lb/> hay-field and the dairy might
                    have been expected to be.</p>
                <p>I will, but let me take these sheets along with me. I will <lb/> read them, that
                    I am determined, before I sleep, and watch <lb/> if you have told the whole
                    truth.</p>
                <p>Do so, if you please; but remember one thing. Mrs. <lb/> Wentworth requested me
                    to write not as if it were designed <lb/> for her perusal, but for those who
                    have no previous <reg orig="know-|ledge">knowledge</reg>
                    <lb/> of her or of me. 'Twas an odd request. I cannot <lb/> imagine what she
                    means by it, but she never acts without <lb/> good reason, and I have done so.
                    And now withdraw, my <lb/> dear, and farewell.</p>

                <p>Let me see; they tell me this is Monday night. Only <lb/> three days yet to come!
                    If thus restless to day; if my heart <lb/> thus bounds till its mansion scarcely
                    can hold it, what must <lb/> be my state tomorrow! What next day! What as the
                    hour <lb/> hastens on; as the sun descends; as my hand touches her <lb/> in sign
                    of wedded unity, of love without interval; of concord <lb/> without end.</p>
                <p>I must quell these tumults. They will disable me else. <lb/> They will wear out
                    all my strength. They will drain away <lb/> life itself. But who could have
                    thought! So soon! Not <lb/> three months since I first set eyes upon her. Not
                    three <lb/> weeks since our plighted love, and only three days to <reg
                        orig="ter-|minate">terminate</reg>
                    <lb/> suspense and give me <hi rend="italic">all.</hi></p>
                <p>I must compel myself to quiet; to sleep. I must find some <lb/> refuge from
                    anticipations so excruciating. All extremes <lb/> are agonies. A joy like this
                    is too big for this narrow <reg orig="tene-|ment">tenement</reg>. <lb/> I must
                    thrust it forth; I must bar and bolt it out for <lb/> a time, or these frail
                    walls will burst asunder. The pen is a <lb/> pacifyer. It checks the mind's
                    career; it circumscribes <lb/> her wanderings. It traces out, and compels us to
                    adhere to <lb/> one path. It ever was my friend. Often it has blunted my <lb/>
                    vexations; hushed my stormy passions; turned my <reg orig="peevish-|ness"
                        >peevishness</reg>
                    <lb/> to soothing; my fierce revenge to heart dissolving <lb/> pity.</p>
                <p>Perhaps it will befriend me now. It may temper my <lb/> impetuous wishes; lull my
                    intoxication; and render my <lb/> happiness supportable; and, indeed, it has
                    produced partly <lb/> this effect already. My blood, within the few minutes thus
                    <lb/> employed, flows with less destructive rapidity. My thoughts <lb/> range
                    themselves in less disorder. And now that the <reg orig="con-|quest"
                        >conquest</reg>
                    <lb/> is effected, what shall I say? I must continue at the <lb/> pen, or shall
                    immediately relapse.</p>
                <p>What shall I say? Let me look back upon the steps that <lb/> led me hither. Let
                    me recount the preliminaries. I <reg orig="can-|not">cannot</reg>
                    <lb/> do better.</p>
                <p>And first as to Achsa Fielding&mdash;to describe this woman.</p>
                <p>To recount, in brief, so much of her history as has come <lb/> to my knowledge,
                    will best account for that zeal, almost to <lb/> idolatry, with which she has,
                    ever since I thoroughly knew <lb/> her, been regarded by me.</p>
                <pb n="178" entity="eaf033v2_0387" pid="uva-lib:349694"/>
                <p>Never saw I one to whom the term <hi rend="italic">lovely</hi> more truly <reg
                        orig="be-|longed">belonged</reg>. <lb/> And yet, in stature she is too low;
                    in complexion, <lb/> dark and almost sallow; and her eyes, though black and of
                    <lb/> piercing lustre, have a cast, which I cannot well explain. It <lb/>
                    lessens without destroying their lustre and their force to <lb/> charm; but all
                    personal defects are outweighed by her heart <lb/> and her intellect. There is
                    the secret of her power to <reg orig="en-|trance">entrance</reg>
                    <lb/> the soul of the listener and beholder. It is not only <lb/> when she sings
                    that her utterance is musical. It is not only <lb/> when the occasion is urgent
                    and the topic momentous <lb/> that her eloquence is rich and flowing. They are
                    always so.</p>
                <p>I had vowed to love her and serve her, and been her <reg orig="fre-|quent"
                        >frequent</reg>
                    <lb/> visitant, long before I was acquainted with her past <lb/> life. I had
                    casually picked up some intelligence, from <lb/> others, or from her own
                    remarks. I knew very soon that <lb/> she was English by birth, and had been only
                    a year and a <lb/> half in America; that she had scarcely passed her twenty
                    <lb/> fifth year, and was still embellished with all the graces of <lb/> youth;
                    that she had been a wife; but was uninformed <lb/> whether the knot had been
                    untied by death or divorce; <lb/> that she possessed considerable, and even
                    splendid fortune; <lb/> but the exact amount, and all besides these particulars,
                    were <lb/> unknown to me till some time after our acquaintance was <lb/>
                    begun.</p>
                <p>One evening, she had been talking very earnestly on the <lb/> influence annexed,
                    in Great Britain, to birth, and had given <lb/> me some examples of this
                    influence. Meanwhile, my eyes <lb/> were fixed steadfastly on hers. The
                    peculiarity in their <reg orig="ex-|pression">expression</reg>
                    <lb/> never before affected me so strongly. A vague <lb/> resemblance to
                    something seen elsewhere, on the same day, <lb/> occurred, and occasioned me to
                    exclaim, suddenly, in a <lb/> pause of her discourse&mdash;</p>
                <p>As I live, my good mamma, those eyes of yours have told <lb/> me a secret. I
                    almost think they spoke to me; and I am <lb/> not less amazed at the strangeness
                    than at the distinctness of <lb/> their story.</p>
                <p>And pry'thee what have they said?</p>
                <p>Perhaps I was mistaken. I might have been deceived <lb/> by a fancied voice, or
                    have confounded one word with <reg orig="ano-|ther">another</reg>
                    <lb/> near akin to it; but let me die, if I did not think they <lb/> said that
                    you were&mdash;<hi rend="italic">a Jew.</hi></p>
                <pb n="179" entity="eaf033v2_0388" pid="uva-lib:349695"/>
                <p>At this sound, her features were instantly veiled with the <lb/> deepest sorrow
                    and confusion. She put her hand to her <lb/> eyes, the tears started and she
                    sobbed. My surprise at this <lb/> effect of my words, was equal to my
                    contrition. I besought <lb/> her to pardon me, for having thus unknowingly
                    alarmed and <lb/> grieved her.</p>
                <p>After she had regained some composure, she said, you <lb/> have not offended,
                    Arthur. Your surmise was just and <lb/> natural, and could not always have
                    escaped you. <reg orig="Connect-|ed">Connected</reg>
                    <lb/> with that word are many sources of anguish, which time <lb/> has not, and
                    never will, dry up; and the less I think of past <lb/> events, the less will my
                    peace be disturbed. I was desirous <lb/> that you should know nothing of me, but
                    what you see; <lb/> nothing but the present and the future, merely that no <lb/>
                    allusions might occur in our conversation, which will call up <lb/> sorrows and
                    regrets that will avail nothing.</p>
                <p>I now perceive the folly of endeavoring to keep you in <lb/> ignorance, and shall
                    therefore, once for all, inform you of <lb/> what has befallen me, that your
                    inquiries and suggestions <lb/> may be made, and fully satisfied at once, and
                    your curiosity <lb/> have no motive for calling back my thoughts to what I <lb/>
                    ardently desire to bury in oblivion.</p>
                <p>My father was indeed a <hi rend="italic">Jew,</hi> and one of the most opulent
                    <lb/> of his nation in London. A Portuguese by birth, but came <lb/> to London
                    when a boy. He had few of the moral or <reg orig="exter-|nal">external</reg>
                    <lb/> qualities of Jews. For I suppose there is some justice in <lb/> the
                    obloquy that follows them so closely. He was frugal <lb/> without meanness, and
                    cautious in his dealings, without <reg orig="ex-|tortion">extortion</reg>. <lb/>
                    I need not fear to say this, for it was the general <lb/> voice.</p>
                <p>Me, an only child, and of course, the darling of my <reg orig="pa-|rents"
                        >parents</reg>, <lb/> they trained up in the most liberal manner. My <lb/>
                    education was purely English. I learned the same things <lb/> and of the same
                    masters with my neighbors. Except <reg orig="fre-|quenting">frequenting</reg>
                    <lb/> their church and repeating their creed, and <reg orig="par-|taking"
                        >partaking</reg>
                    <lb/> of the same food, I saw no difference between them <lb/> and me. Hence I
                    grew more indifferent, perhaps, than <lb/> was proper, to the distinctions of
                    religion. They were <lb/> never enforced upon me. No pains were taken to fill me
                    <lb/> with scruples and antipathies. They never stood, as I <lb/>
                    <pb n="180" entity="eaf033v2_0389" pid="uva-lib:349696"/> may say, upon the
                    threshold. They were often thought <lb/> upon, but were vague and easily eluded
                    or forgotten.</p>
                <p>Hence it was that my heart too readily admitted <reg orig="impres-|sions"
                        >impressions</reg>, <lb/> that more zeal and more parental caution would
                    have <lb/> saved me from. They could scarcely be avoided, as my <lb/> society
                    was wholly English; and my youth, my education, <lb/> and my father's wealth
                    made me an object of much <reg orig="atten-|tion">attention</reg>. <lb/> And the
                    same causes that lulled to sleep my own <lb/> watchfulness, had the same effect
                    upon that of others. To <lb/> regret or to praise this remissness, is now too
                    late. Certain <lb/> it is, that my destiny, and not a happy destiny, was fixed
                    <lb/> by it.</p>
                <p>The fruit of this remissness was a passion for one, who <lb/> fully returned it.
                    Almost as young I, who was only sixteen; <lb/> he knew as little as myself, what
                    obstacles the difference of <lb/> our births was likely to raise between us. His
                    father, Sir <lb/> Ralph Fielding, a man nobly born, high in office, splendidly
                    <lb/> allied, could not be expected to consent to the marriage of <lb/> his
                    eldest son, in such green youth, to the daughter of an <lb/> alien, a
                    Portuguese, a Jew; but these impediments were <lb/> not seen by my ignorance,
                    and were overlooked by the <lb/> youth's passion.</p>
                <p>But strange to tell, what common prudence would have <lb/> so confidently
                    predicted, did not happen. Sir Ralph had <lb/> a numerous family, likely to be
                    still more so; had but <reg orig="slen-|der">slender</reg>
                    <lb/> patrimony; the income of his offices nearly made up <lb/> his all. The
                    young man was headstrong, impetuous, and <lb/> would probably disregard the
                    inclinations of his family. <lb/> Yet the father would not consent but on one
                    condition, that <lb/> of my admission to the English church.</p>
                <p>No very strenuous opposition to these terms could be <reg orig="ex-|pected"
                        >expected</reg>
                    <lb/> from me. At so thoughtless an age, with an <reg orig="educa-|tion"
                        >education</reg>
                    <lb/> so unfavorable to religious impressions; swayed <reg orig="like-|wise"
                        >likewise</reg>, <lb/> by the strongest of human passions; made somewhat
                    <lb/> impatient by the company I kept, of the disrepute and <lb/> scorn to which
                    the Jewish nation are every where <reg orig="con-|demned">condemned</reg>, <lb/>
                    I could not be expected to be very averse to the <lb/> scheme.</p>
                <p>My fears, as to what my father's decision would be, were <lb/> soon at an end. He
                    loved his child too well to thwart <lb/> her wishes in so essential a point.
                    Finding in me no <reg orig="scru-|ples">scruples</reg>, <lb/>

                    </pb> no unwillingness, he thought it absurd to be scrupulous <lb/> for me. My
                    own heart having abjured my religion, it was <lb/> absurd to make any difficulty
                    about a formal renunciation. <lb/> These were his avowed reasons for
                    concurrence, but time <lb/> shewed that he had probably other reasons, founded,
                    indeed, <lb/> in his regard for my happiness, but such, as, if they had <lb/>
                    been known, would probably have strengthened into <reg orig="invin-|cible"
                        >invincible</reg>, <lb/> the reluctance of my lover's family.</p>
                <p>No marriage was ever attended with happier presages. <lb/> The numerous relations
                    of my husband admitted me with <lb/> the utmost cordiality among them. My
                    father's tenderness <lb/> was unabated by this change, and those humiliations to
                    <lb/> which I had before been exposed, were now no more; and <lb/> every tie was
                    strengthened, at the end of a year, by the <lb/> feelings of a <hi rend="italic"
                        >mother.</hi> I had need, indeed, to know a season <lb/> of happiness, that

                <p>A shocking tale it was! and told abruptly, with every <lb/> unpitying
                    aggravation. I hinted to you once, my father's <lb/> death. The <hi

                    <lb/> by my mother's watchful tenderness. Yet none could <lb/> suspect him

                    affairs, suspected the havoc that <lb/> mischance had made of his property.</p>

                        orig="deter-|mined">determined</reg>
                    <lb/> not to survive the day that should reduce him to <lb/>
                    <pb n="182" entity="eaf033v2_0391" pid="uva-lib:349698"/> indigence. The
                    desperate act was thus preconcerted&mdash;thus <lb/> deliberate.</p>
                <p>The true state of his affairs was laid open by his death. <lb/> The failure of
                    great mercantile houses at Frankfort and <lb/> Liege was the cause of his
                    disasters.</p>
                <p>Thus were my prospects shut in. That wealth, which, no <lb/> doubt, furnished the
                    chief inducement with my husband's <lb/> family to concur in his choice, was now
                    suddenly exchanged <lb/> for poverty.</p>
                <p>Bred up, as I had been, in pomp and luxury; conscious <lb/> that my wealth was my
                    chief security from the contempt of <lb/> the proud and bigoted, and my chief
                    title to the station to <lb/> which I had been raised, and which I the more
                    delighted in <lb/> because it enabled me to confer so great obligations on my
                    <lb/> husband. What reverse could be harder than this, and how <lb/> much
                    bitterness was added by it to the grief, occasioned by <lb/> the violent end of
                    my father!</p>
                <p>Yet, loss of fortune, though it mortified my pride, did not <lb/> prove my worst
                    calamity. Perhaps it was scarcely to be <lb/> ranked with evils, since it
                    furnished a touchstone by which <lb/> my husband's affections were to be tried;
                    especially as the <lb/> issue of the trial was auspicious; for my misfortune
                    seemed <lb/> only to heighten the interest which my character had made <lb/> for
                    me in the hearts of all that knew me. The paternal <reg orig="re-|gards"
                        >regards</reg>
                    <lb/> of Sir Ralph had always been tender, but that <reg orig="tender-|ness"
                        >tenderness</reg>
                    <lb/> seemed now to be redoubled.</p>
                <p>New events made this consolation still more necessary. <lb/> My unhappy
                    mother!&mdash;She was nearer to the dreadful <lb/> scene when it happened; had
                    no surviving object to <reg orig="be-|guile">beguile</reg>
                    <lb/> her sorrow; was rendered, by long habit, more <reg orig="depend-|ent"
                        >dependent</reg>
                    <lb/> upon fortune than her child.</p>
                <p>A melancholy, always mute, was the first effect upon my <lb/> mother. Nothing
                    could charm her eye, or her ear. Sweet <lb/> sounds that she once loved, and
                    especially when her darling <lb/> child was the warbler, were heard no longer.
                    How, with <lb/> streaming eyes, have I sat and watched the dear lady, and <lb/>
                    endeavored to catch her eye, to rouse her attention!&mdash;But <lb/> I must not
                    think of these things.</p>
                <p>But even this distress was little in comparison with what <lb/> was to come. A
                    frenzy thus mute, motionless and vacant, <lb/>
                    <pb n="183" entity="eaf033v2_0392" pid="uva-lib:349699"/> was succeeded by fits,
                    talkative, outrageous, requiring <reg orig="inces-|sant">incessant</reg>
                    <lb/> superintendence, restraint, and even violence.</p>
                <p>Why led you me thus back to my sad remembrances? <lb/> Excuse me for the present.
                    I will tell you the rest some <lb/> other time; tomorrow.</p>
                <p>Tomorrow, accordingly, my friend resumed her story.</p>
                <p>Let me now make an end, said she, of my mournful <lb/> narrative, and never, I
                    charge you, do any thing to revive <lb/> it again.</p>
                <p>Deep as was my despondency, occasioned by these <reg orig="ca-|lamities"
                        >calamities</reg>, <lb/> I was not destitute of some joy. My husband and
                    <lb/> my child were lovely and affectionate. In their caresses, <lb/> in their
                    welfare, I found peace; and might still have found <lb/> it, had there not
                    been&mdash;But why should I open afresh, <lb/> wounds which time has imperfectly
                    closed? But the story <lb/> must some time be told to you, and the sooner it is
                    told <lb/> and dismissed to forgetfulness, the better.</p>
                <p>My ill fate led me into company with a woman too well <lb/> known in the idle and
                    dissipated circles. Her character <lb/> was not unknown to me. There was nothing
                    in her features <lb/> or air to obviate disadvantageous prepossessions. I sought
                    <lb/> not her intercourse; I rather shunned it, as unpleasing and <lb/>
                    discreditable, but she would not be repulsed. Self-invited, <lb/> she made
                    herself my frequent guest; took unsolicited part <lb/> in my concerns; did me
                    many kind offices; and, at length, <lb/> in spite of my counter inclination, won
                    upon my sympathy <lb/> and gratitude.</p>
                <p>No one in the world, did I fondly think, had I less <reg orig="rea-|son"
                        >reason</reg>
                    <lb/> to fear than Mrs. Waring. Her character excited not <lb/> the slightest
                    apprehension for my own safety. She was <reg orig="up-|wards">upwards</reg>
                    <lb/> of forty, nowise remarkable for grace or beauty; <lb/> tawdry in her
                    dress; accustomed to render more <reg orig="conspicu-|ous">conspicuous</reg>
                    <lb/> the traces of age by her attempts to hide them; the <lb/> mother of a
                    numerous family, with a mind but slenderly <lb/> cultivated; always careful to
                    save appearances; studiously <lb/> preserving distance with my husband, and he,
                    like myself, <lb/> enduring, rather than wishing her society. What could I fear
                    <lb/> from the arts of such a one?</p>
                <p>But alas! the woman had consummate address. Patience <lb/> too, that nothing
                    could tire. Watchfulness that none could <lb/> detect. Insinuation the wiliest
                    and most subtle. Thus <lb/>
                    <pb n="184" entity="eaf033v2_0393" pid="uva-lib:349700"/> wound she herself into
                    my affections, by an unexampled <lb/> perseverance in seeming kindness; by
                    tender confidence; <lb/> by artful glosses of past misconduct; by self-rebukes
                    and <lb/> feigned contritions.</p>
                <p>Never were stratagems so intricate, dissimulation so <reg orig="pro-|found"
                        >profound</reg>! <lb/> But still, that such a one should seduce my <reg
                        orig="hus-|band">husband</reg>; <lb/> young, generous, ambitious, impatient
                    of contumely <lb/> and reproach, and surely not indifferent; before this fatal
                        <reg orig="inter-|course">intercourse</reg>, <lb/> not indifferent to his
                    wife and child!&mdash;Yet, so it was!</p>
                <p>I saw his discontents; his struggles; I heard him curse <lb/> this woman, and the
                    more deeply for my attempts, <reg orig="uncon-|scious">unconscious</reg>
                    <lb/> as I was of her machinations, to reconcile them to <lb/> each other, to do
                    away what seemed a causeless indignation, <lb/> or antipathy against her. How
                    little I suspected the nature <lb/> of the conflict in his heart, between a new
                    passion and the <lb/> claims of pride; of conscience and of humanity; the claims
                    <lb/> of a child and a wife; a wife already in affliction, and placing <lb/> all
                    that yet remained of happiness, in the firmness of his <lb/> virtue; in the
                    continuance of his love; a wife, at the very <lb/> hour of his meditated flight,
                    full of terrors at the near <reg orig="ap-|proach">approach</reg>
                    <lb/> of an event, whose agonies demand a double share <lb/> of a husband's
                    supporting; encouraging love&mdash;</p>
                <p>Good Heaven! For what evils are some of thy creatures <lb/> reserved! Resignation
                    to thy decree, in the last, and most <lb/> cruel distress, was, indeed, a hard
                    task.</p>
                <p>He was gone. Some unavoidable engagement calling <lb/> him to Hamburgh was
                    pleaded. Yet to leave me at such <lb/> an hour! I dare not upbraid, nor object.
                    The tale was so <lb/> specious! The fortunes of a friend depended on his <reg
                        orig="punc-|tual">punctual</reg>
                    <lb/> journey. The falsehood of his story too soon made <lb/> itself known. He
                    was gone, in company with his detested <lb/> paramour!</p>
                <p>Yet, though my vigilance was easily deceived, it was not <lb/> so with others. A
                    creditor, who had his bond for three <lb/> thousand pounds, pursued, and
                    arrested him at Harwich. <lb/> He was thrown into prison, but his companion, let
                    me, at <lb/> least, say that in her praise, would not desert him. She <lb/> took
                    lodging near the place of his confinement, and saw him <lb/> daily. That, had
                    she not done it, and had my personal <lb/> condition allowed, should have been
                    my province.</p>
                <p>Indignation and grief hastened the painful crisis with me. <lb/>
                    <pb n="185" entity="eaf033v2_0394" pid="uva-lib:349701"/> I did not weep that
                    the second fruit of this unhappy union <lb/> saw not the light. I wept only that
                    this hour of agony, was <lb/> not, to its unfortunate mother, the last.</p>
                <p>I felt not anger; I had nothing but compassion for <reg orig="Field-|ing"
                        >Fielding</reg>. <lb/> Gladly would I have recalled him to my arms and to
                    <lb/> virtue; I wrote, adjuring him by all our past joys, to return; <lb/>
                    vowing only gratitude for his new affection, and claiming <lb/> only the
                    recompense of seeing him restored to his family; <lb/> to liberty; to
                    reputation.</p>
                <p>But alas! Fielding had a good, but a proud heart. He <lb/> looked upon his error
                    with remorse; with self-detestation, <lb/> and with the fatal belief that it
                    could not be retrieved; shame <lb/> made him withstand all my reasonings and
                    persuasions, and <lb/> in the hurry of his feelings, he made solemn vows that he
                    <lb/> would, in the moment of restored liberty, abjure his country <lb/> and his
                    family forever. He bore indignantly the yoke of <lb/> his new attachment, but he
                    strove in vain to shake it off. <lb/> Her behavior, always yielding, doating,
                    supplicative, <reg orig="pre-|served">preserved</reg>
                    <lb/> him in her fetters. Though upbraided, spurned and <lb/> banished from his
                    presence, she would not leave him, but <lb/> by new efforts and new artifices,
                    soothed, appeased, and <lb/> won again, and kept his tenderness.</p>
                <p>What my entreaties were unable to effect, his father <lb/> could not hope to
                    accomplish. He offered to take him <lb/> from prison; the creditor offered to
                    cancel the bond, if he <lb/> would return to me; but this condition he refused.
                    All his <lb/> kindred, and one who had been his bosom friend from <lb/>
                    childhood, joined in beseeching his compliance with these <lb/> conditions; but
                    his pride, his dread of my merited <reg orig="re-|proaches">reproaches</reg>;
                    <lb/> the merits and dissuasions of his new companion, <lb/> whose sacrifices
                    for his sake had not been small, were <reg orig="ob-|stacles">obstacles</reg>
                    <lb/> which nothing could subdue.</p>
                <p>Far, indeed, was I from imposing these conditions. I <lb/> waited only till, by
                    certain arrangements, I could gather <lb/> enough to pay his debts, to enable
                    him to execute his vow; <lb/> empty would have been my claims to his affection,
                    if I <lb/> could have suffered, with the means of his deliverance in <lb/> my
                    hands, my husband to remain a moment in prison.</p>
                <p>The remains of my father's vast fortune was a jointure <lb/> of a thousand pounds
                    a year, settled on my mother, and <lb/> after her death, on me. My mother's
                    helpless condition <lb/>
                    <pb n="186" entity="eaf033v2_0395" pid="uva-lib:349702"/> put this revenue into
                    my disposal. By this means was I <lb/> enabled, without the knowledge of my
                    father-in-law, or <lb/> my husband, to purchase the debt, and dismiss him from
                    <lb/> prison. He set out instantly, in company with his <reg orig="para-|mour"
                        >paramour</reg>, <lb/> to France.</p>
                <p>When somewhat recovered from the shock of this <reg orig="cala-|mity"
                        >calamity</reg>, <lb/> I took up my abode with my mother. What she had <lb/>
                    was enough, as you, perhaps, will think, for plentiful <reg orig="sub-|sistence"
                        >subsistence</reg>, <lb/> but to us, with habits of a different kind, it was
                    <lb/> little better than poverty. That reflection, my father's <reg
                        orig="me-|mory">memory</reg>, <lb/> my mother's deplorable state, which
                    every year grew <lb/> worse, and the late misfortune, were the chief <reg
                        orig="compa-|nions">companions</reg>
                    <lb/> of my thoughts.</p>
                <p>The dear child, whose smiles were uninterrupted by his <lb/> mother's
                    afflictions, was some consolation in my solitude. <lb/> To his instruction and
                    to my mother's wants, all my hours <lb/> were devoted. I was sometimes not
                    without the hope of <lb/> better days. Full as my mind was of Fielding's merits,
                    <lb/> convinced by former proofs of his ardent and generous <lb/> spirit, I
                    trusted that time and reflection would destroy that <lb/> spell by which he was
                    now bound.</p>
                <p>For some time, the progress of these reflections was not <lb/> known. In leaving
                    England, Fielding dropped all <reg orig="corres-|pondence">correspondence</reg>
                    <lb/> and connexion with his native country. He <lb/> parted with the woman at
                    Rouen, leaving no trace behind <lb/> him by which she might follow him, as she
                    wished to do. <lb/> She never returned to England, but died a twelvemonth <lb/>
                    afterwards in Switzerland.</p>
                <p>As to me, I had only to muse day and night upon the <lb/> possible destiny of
                    this beloved fugitive. His incensed <lb/> father cared not for him. He had cast
                    him out of his <reg orig="pa-|ternal">paternal</reg>
                    <lb/> affections, ceased to make inquiries respecting him, <lb/> and even wished
                    never to hear of him again. My boy <reg orig="suc-|ceeded">succeeded</reg>
                    <lb/> to my husband's place in his grandfather's affections, <lb/> and in the
                    hopes and views of the family; and his mother <lb/> wanted nothing which their
                    compassionate and respectful <lb/> love could bestow.</p>
                <p>Three long and tedious years passed away, and no tidings <lb/> were received.
                    Whether he were living or dead, nobody <lb/> could tell. At length, an English
                    traveller, going out of <lb/> the customary road from Italy, met with Fielding,
                    in a town <lb/>
                    <pb n="187" entity="eaf033v2_0396" pid="uva-lib:349703"/> in the Venaissin. His
                    manners, habits and language, had <lb/> become French. He seemed unwilling to be
                    recognised by <lb/> an old acquaintance, but not being able to avoid this, and
                    <lb/> becoming gradually familiar, he informed the traveller of <lb/> many
                    particulars in his present situation. It appeared that <lb/> he had made himself
                    useful to a neighboring <hi rend="italic">Seigneur,</hi> in <lb/> whose <hi
                        rend="italic">chateau</hi> he had long lived on the footing of a brother.
                    <lb/> France he had resolved to make his future country, and <lb/> among other
                    changes for that end, he had laid aside his <lb/> English name, and taken that
                    of his patron, which was <lb/>
                    <hi rend="italic">Perrin.</hi> He had endeavored to compensate himself for all
                    <lb/> other privations, by devoting himself to rural amusements <lb/> and to

                <p>He carefully shunned all inquiries respecting me, but <lb/> when my name was
                    mentioned by his friend, who knew <lb/> well all that had happened, and my
                    general welfare, <reg orig="to-|gether">together</reg>
                    <lb/> with that of his son, asserted, he shewed deep <reg orig="sen-|sibility"

                    <lb/> with his situation.</p>
                <p>I cannot describe the effect of this intelligence on me. <lb/> My hopes of
                    bringing him back to me, were suddenly <reg orig="re-|vived">revived</reg>.
                    <lb/> I wrote him a letter, in which I poured forth my <lb/> whole heart; but
                    his answer contained avowals of all his <lb/> former resolutions, to which time
                    had only made his <reg orig="ad-|herence">adherence</reg>
                    <lb/> more easy. A second and third letter were <reg orig="writ-|ten"
                        >written</reg>, <lb/> and an offer made to follow him to his retreat, and
                    <lb/> share his exile; but all my efforts availed nothing. He <lb/> solemnly and
                    repeatedly renounced all the claims of a <reg orig="hus-|band">husband</reg>
                    <lb/> over me, and absolved me from every obligation as a <lb/> wife.</p>
                <p>His part in this correspondence, was performed without <lb/> harshness or
                    contempt. A strange mixture there was of <lb/> pathos and indifference; of
                    tenderness and resolution. <lb/> Hence I continually derived hope, which time,
                    however, <lb/> brought no nearer to certainty.</p>
                <p>At the opening of the revolution, the name of Perrin <reg orig="ap-|peared"
                        >appeared</reg>
                    <lb/> among the deputies to the constituent assembly, for <lb/> the district in
                    which he resided. He had thus succeeded <lb/> in gaining all the rights of a
                    French citizen; and the hopes <lb/> of his return became almost extinct; but
                    that, and every <lb/> other hope, respecting him, has since been totally <reg

                    <lb/>
                    <pb n="188" entity="eaf033v2_0397" pid="uva-lib:349704"/> by his marriage with
                    Marguerite D'Almont, a <lb/> young lady of great merit and fortune, and a native
                    of <lb/> Avignon.</p>
                <p>A long period of suspense was now at an end, and left <lb/> me in a state almost
                    as full of anguish as that which our <lb/> first separation produced. My sorrows
                    were increased by <lb/> my mother's death, and this incident freeing me from
                    those <lb/> restraints upon my motions which before existed, I <reg
                        orig="deter-|mined">determined</reg>
                    <lb/> to come to America.</p>
                <p>My son was now eight years old, and his grandfather <lb/> claiming the province
                    of his instruction, I was persuaded to <lb/> part with him, that he might be
                    sent to a distant school. <lb/> Thus was another tie removed, and in spite of
                    the well <lb/> meant importunities of my friends, I persisted in my scheme <lb/>
                    of crossing the ocean.</p>
                <p>I could not help, at this part of her narration, expressing <lb/> my surprise
                    that any motives were strong enough to <reg orig="recom-|mend">recommend</reg>
                    <lb/> this scheme.</p>
                <p>It was certainly a freak of despair. A few months would, <lb/> perhaps, have
                    allayed the fresh grief, and reconciled me to <lb/> my situation; but I would
                    not pause or deliberate. My <lb/> scheme was opposed by my friends, with great
                    earnestness. <lb/> During my voyage, affrighted by the dangers which <reg
                        orig="sur-|rounded">surrounded</reg>
                    <lb/> me, and to which I was wholly unused, I heartily <lb/> repented of my
                    resolution; but now, methinks, I have <reg orig="rea-|son">reason</reg>
                    <lb/> to rejoice at my perseverance. I have come into a <lb/> scene and society
                    so new, I have had so many claims made <lb/> upon my ingenuity and fortitude,
                    that my mind has been <lb/> diverted in some degree from former sorrows. There
                    are <lb/> even times when I wholly forget them, and catch myself <reg
                        orig="in-|dulging">indulging</reg>
                    <lb/> in cheerful reveries.</p>
                <p>I have often reflected with surprise on the nature of my <lb/> own mind. It is
                    eight years since my father's violent death. <lb/> How few of my hours since
                    that period, have been blessed <lb/> with serenity! How many nights and days, in
                    hateful and <lb/> lingering succession, have been bathed in tears and <reg

                    <lb/> with regrets! That I am still alive with so many <lb/> causes of death,
                    and with such a slow consuming malady, <lb/> is surely to be wondered at.</p>
                <p>I believe the worst foes of man, at least of men in grief, <lb/> are solitude and
                    idleness. The same eternally occurring <lb/>

                    and uniformity is sometimes mistaken for those <lb/> of grief. Yes, I am glad I
                    came to America. My relations <lb/> are importunate for my return, and, till
                    lately, I had some <lb/> thoughts of it; but I think now, I shall stay where I
                    am, <lb/> for the rest of my days.</p>
                <p>Since I arrived, I am become more of a student than I <lb/> used to be. I always
                    loved literature, but never, till of late, <lb/> had a mind enough at ease, to
                    read with advantage. I <lb/> now find pleasure in the occupation which I never
                    expected <lb/> to find.</p>
                <p>You see in what manner I live. The letters which I <lb/> brought secured me a
                    flattering reception from the best <lb/> people in your country; but scenes of
                    gay resort had <lb/> nothing to attract me, and I quickly withdrew to that <reg
                        orig="seclu-|sion">seclusion</reg>
                    <lb/> in which you now find me. Here, always at leisure, <lb/> and mistress of
                    every laudable means of gratification, I am <lb/> not without the belief of
                    serene days yet to come.</p>
                <p>I now ventured to inquire what were her latest tidings of <lb/> her husband.</p>
                <p>At the opening of the revolution, I told you, he became <lb/> a champion of the
                    people. By his zeal and his efforts he <lb/> acquired such importance as to be
                    deputed to the National <lb/> Assembly. In this post he was the adherent of
                    violent <lb/> measures, till the subversion of monarchy; and then, when <lb/>
                    too late for his safety, he checked his career.</p>
                <p>And what has since become of him?</p>
                <p>She sighed deeply. You were yesterday reading a list <lb/> of the proscribed
                    under Robespierre. I checked you. I <lb/> had good reason. But this subject
                    grows too painful; let <lb/> us change it.</p>
                <p>Some time after, I ventured to renew this topic; and <lb/> discovered that
                    Fielding, under his new name of Perrin <lb/> d'Almont, was among the outlawed
                    deputies of last year,<ref target="n1" n="1">*</ref>
                    <note id="n1" place="foot" n="1"><seg type="note-symbol"

                    <lb/> and had been slain in resisting the officers sent to arrest him. <lb/> My
                    friend had been informed that his <hi rend="italic">wife,</hi> Philippine <reg
                        orig="d'Al-|mont">d'Almont</reg>, <lb/> whom she had reason to believe a

                    <pb n="190" entity="eaf033v2_0399" pid="uva-lib:349706"/> part of America. She
                    had made various attempts, but in <lb/> vain, to find out her retreat. Ah! said
                    I, you must <reg orig="com-|mission">commission</reg>
                    <lb/> me to find her. I will hunt her through the <reg orig="conti-|nent"

                    <lb/> from Penobscot to Savannah. I will not leave a nook <lb/> unsearched.</p>

                <p><hi rend="small-caps">None</hi> will be surprised, that to a woman thus
                    unfortunate <lb/> and thus deserving, my heart willingly rendered up all its
                    <lb/> sympathies; that as I partook of all her grief, I hailed, with <lb/> equal
                    delight, those omens of felicity which now, at length, <lb/> seemed to play in
                    her fancy.</p>
                <p>I saw her often, as often as my engagements would <reg orig="per-|mit"
                        >permit</reg>, <lb/> and oftener than I allowed myself to visit any other.
                    <lb/> In this I was partly selfish. So much entertainment, so <lb/> much of the
                    best instruction did her conversation afford me, <lb/> that I never had enough
                    of it.</p>
                <p>Her experience had been so much larger than mine, and <lb/> so wholly different,
                    and she possessed such unbounded <lb/> facility of recounting all she had seen
                    and felt, and <reg orig="ab-|solute">absolute</reg>
                    <lb/> sincerity and unreserve in this respect, were so <lb/> fully established
                    between us, that I can imagine nothing <lb/> equally instructive and delightful
                    with her conversation.</p>
                <p>Books are cold, jejune, vexatious in their sparingness of <lb/> information at
                    one time, and their impertinent loquacity at <lb/> another. Besides, all they
                    choose to give, they give at <lb/> once; they allow no questions; offer no
                    further <reg orig="explana-|tions">explanations</reg>, <lb/> and bend not to the
                    caprices of our curiosity. They <lb/> talk to us behind a screen. Their tone is

                    the human heart; of <lb/> society as it existed in another world, more abundant
                    in the <lb/>
                    <pb n="191" entity="eaf033v2_0400" pid="uva-lib:349707"/> varieties of customs
                    and characters, than I had ever had the <lb/> power to witness.</p>
                <p>Partly selfish I have said my motives were, but not wholly <lb/> so, as long as I
                    saw that my friend derived pleasure, in her <lb/> turn, from my company. Not
                    that I could add directly to <lb/> her knowledge or pleasure, but that expansion
                    of heart, <lb/> that case of utterance and flow of ideas which always were <lb/>
                    occasioned by my approach, were sources of true pleasure <lb/> of which she had
                    been long deprived, and for which her <lb/> privation had given her a higher
                    relish than ever.</p>
                <p>She lived in great affluence and independence, but made <lb/> use of her
                    privileges of fortune chiefly to secure to herself <lb/> the command of her own
                    time. She had been long ago <lb/> tired and disgusted with the dull and fulsome
                    uniformity <lb/> and parade of the play-house and ball-room. Formal <lb/> visits
                    were endured as mortifications and penances, by <lb/> which the delights of
                    privacy and friendly intercourse <lb/> were by contrast increased. Music she
                    loved, but never <lb/> sought it in places of public resort, or from the skill
                    of <lb/> mercenary performers, and books were not the least of her <lb/>
                    pleasures.</p>
                <p>As to me, I was wax in her hand. Without design and <lb/> without effort, I was
                    always of that form she wished me to <lb/> assume. My own happiness became a
                    secondary passion, <lb/> and her gratification the great end of my being. When
                    <lb/> with her, I thought not of myself. I had scarcely a <reg orig="sepa-|rate"
                        >separate</reg>
                    <lb/> or independent existence, since my senses were <reg orig="occu-|pied"
                        >occupied</reg>
                    <lb/> by her, and my mind was full of those ideas which her <lb/> discourse
                    communicated. To meditate on her looks and <lb/> words, and to pursue the means
                    suggested by my own <lb/> thoughts, or by her, conducive, in any way, to her
                    good, <lb/> was all my business.</p>
                <p>What a fate, said I, at the conclusion of one of our <reg orig="in-|terviews"
                        >interviews</reg>, <lb/> has been yours. But, thank Heaven, the storm <lb/>
                    has disappeared before the age of sensibility has gone past, <lb/> and without
                    drying up every source of happiness. You <lb/> are still young; all your powers
                    unimpaired; rich in the <lb/> compassion and esteem of the world; wholly
                    independent <lb/> of the claims and caprices of others; amply supplied with
                    <lb/> that means of usefulness, called money; wise in that <reg
                        orig="expe-|rience">experience</reg>
                    <lb/> which only adversity can give. Past evils and <reg orig="suf-|ferings"

                    <pb n="192" entity="eaf033v2_0401" pid="uva-lib:349708"/> if incurred and
                    endured without guilt, if called to <lb/> view without remorse, make up the
                    materials of present joy. <lb/> They cheer our most dreary hours with the
                    whispered <reg orig="ac-|cents">accents</reg>
                    <lb/> of "well done," and they heighten our pleasures into <lb/> somewhat of
                    celestial brilliancy, by furnishing a deep, a <lb/> ruefully deep contrast.</p>
                <p>From this moment, I will cease to weep for you. I will <lb/> call you the
                    happiest of women. I will share with you your <lb/> happiness by witnessing
                    it&mdash;but that shall not content me. <lb/> I must some way contribute to it.
                    Tell me how I shall <lb/> serve you? What can I do to make you happier? Poor
                    <lb/> am I in every thing but zeal, but still I may do something. <lb/>
                    What&mdash;pray tell me what can I do?</p>
                <p>She looked at me with sweet and solemn significance. <lb/> What it was exactly, I
                    could not divine, yet I was strangely <lb/> affected by it. It was but a glance,
                    instantly withdrawn. <lb/> She made me no answer.</p>
                <p>You must not be silent; you <hi rend="italic">must</hi> tell me what I can do
                    <lb/> for you. Hitherto I have done nothing. All the service is <lb/> on your
                    side. Your conversation has been my study, a <lb/> delightful study, but the
                    profit has only been mine. Tell <lb/> me how I can be grateful&mdash;my voice
                    and manner, I believe, <lb/> seldom belie my feelings. At this time, I had
                    almost done <lb/> what a second thought made me suspect to be unauthorized.
                    <lb/> Yet I cannot tell why. My heart had nothing in it but <reg
                        orig="reve-|rence">reverence</reg>
                    <lb/> and admiration. Was she not the substitute of my <lb/> lost mamma? Would I
                    not have clasped that beloved <lb/> shade? Yet the two beings were not just the
                    same, or I <lb/> should not, as now, have checked myself, and only pressed <lb/>
                    her hand to my lips.</p>
                <p>Tell me, repeated I, what can I do to serve you? I read <lb/> to you a little
                    now, and you are pleased with my reading. <lb/> I copy for you when you want the
                    time. I guide the reins <lb/> for you when you choose to ride. Humble offices,
                    indeed, <lb/> though, perhaps, all that a raw youth like me can do for <lb/>
                    you; but I can be still more assiduous. I can read several <lb/> hours in the
                    day, instead of one. I can write ten times as <lb/> much as now.</p>
                <p>Are you not my lost mamma come back again? And <lb/> yet, not <hi rend="italic"
                        >exactly</hi> her, I think. Something different; something <lb/> better, I

                <p>Her eyes now overflowed without restraint. She <reg orig="articu-|lated"

                    wrong to stay so late.</p>
                <p>I have been wrong, but how too late! I entered but this <lb/> moment. It is
                    twilight still; is it not?</p>
                <p>No&mdash;it is almost twelve. You have been here a long <lb/> four hours; short
                    ones, I would rather say&mdash;but indeed you <lb/> must go.</p>
                <p>What made me so thoughtless of the time! But I will <lb/> go, yet not till you
                    forgive me. I approached her with a <lb/> confidence, and for a purpose at
                    which, upon reflection, I <lb/> am not a little surprised, but the being called
                    Mervyn is not <lb/> the same in her company and in that of another. What is
                    <lb/> the difference, and whence comes it? Her words and looks <lb/> engross me.
                    My mind wants room for any other object. <lb/> But why inquire whence the
                    difference? The superiority <lb/> of her merits and attractions to all those
                    whom I knew, <lb/> would surely account for my fervor. Indifference, if I felt
                    <lb/> it, would be the only just occasion of wonder.</p>
                <p>The hour was, indeed, too late, and I hastened home. <lb/> Stevens was waiting my
                    return with some anxiety. I <reg orig="apol-|ogized">apologized</reg>
                    <lb/> for my delay, and recounted to him what had just <lb/>
                    <pb n="194" entity="eaf033v2_0403" pid="uva-lib:349710"/> passed. He listened
                    with more than usual interest. When <lb/> I had finished,&mdash;</p>
                <p>Mervyn, said he, you seem not to be aware of your <reg orig="pre-|sent"
                        >present</reg>
                    <lb/> situation. From what you now tell me, and from what <lb/> you have
                    formerly told me, one thing seems very plain to <lb/> me.</p>
                <p>Pry'thee, what is it?</p>
                <p>Eliza Hadwin&mdash;do you wish&mdash;could you bear to see her <lb/> the wife of
                    another?</p>
                <p>Five years hence I will answer you. Then my answer <lb/> may be&mdash;"No; I wish
                    her only to be mine." Till then, I <lb/> wish her only to be my pupil, my ward,
                    my sister.</p>
                <p>But these are remote considerations; they are bars to <lb/> marriage, but not to
                    love. Would it not molest and disquiet <lb/> you to observe in her a passion for
                    another?</p>
                <p>It would, but only on her own account; not on mine. At <lb/> a suitable age it is
                    very likely I may love her, because, it is <lb/> likely, if she holds on in her
                    present career, she will then be <lb/> worthy, but, at present, though I would
                    die to insure her <lb/> happiness, I have no wish to insure it by marriage with
                    her.</p>
                <p>Is there no other whom you love?</p>
                <p>No. There is one worthier than all others; one whom I <lb/> wish the woman who
                    shall be my wife to resemble in all <lb/> things.</p>
                <p>And who is this model?</p>
                <p>You know I can only mean Achsa Fielding.</p>
                <p>If you love her likeness, why not love herself?</p>
                <p>I felt my heart leap.&mdash;What a thought is that! Love her <lb/> I <hi
                        rend="italic">do</hi> as I love my God; as I love virtue. To love her in
                    <lb/> another sense would brand me for a lunatic.</p>
                <p>To love her as a woman, then, appears to you an act of <lb/> folly.</p>
                <p>In me it would be worse than folly. 'Twould be frenzy.</p>
                <p>And why?</p>
                <p>Why? Really, my friend, you astonish me. Nay, you <lb/> startle me&mdash;for a
                    question like that implies a doubt in you <lb/> whether I have not actually
                    harbored the thought.</p>
                <p>No, said he, smiling, presumptuous though you be, you <lb/> have not, to be sure,
                    reached so high a pitch. But still, <lb/> though I think you innocent of so
                    heinous an offence, there <lb/>
                    <pb n="195" entity="eaf033v2_0404" pid="uva-lib:349711"/> is no harm in asking
                    why you might not love her, and even <lb/> seek her for a wife.</p>
                <p>Achsa Fielding <hi rend="italic">my wife!</hi> Good Heaven!&mdash;The very <lb/>
                    sound threw my soul into unconquerable tumults. Take <lb/> care, my friend,
                    continued I, in beseeching accents, you <lb/> may do me more injury than you
                    conceive, by even starting <lb/> such a thought.</p>
                <p>True, said he, as long as such obstacles exist to your <lb/> success; so many
                    incurable objections; for instance, she is <lb/> six years older than you.</p>
                <p>That is an advantage. Her age is what it ought to be.</p>
                <p>But she has been a wife and mother already.</p>
                <p>That is likewise an advantage. She has wisdom, because <lb/> she has experience.
                    Her sensibilities are stronger, because <lb/> they have been exercised and
                    chastened. Her first <reg orig="mar-|riage">marriage</reg>
                    <lb/> was unfortunate. The purer is the felicity she will <lb/> taste in a
                    second! If her second choice be propitious, the <lb/> greater her tenderness and
                    gratitude.</p>
                <p>But she is a foreigner; independent of control, and rich.</p>
                <p>All which are blessings to herself, and to him for whom <lb/> her hand is
                    reserved; especially, if, like me, he is indigent.</p>
                <p>But then she is unsightly as a <hi rend="italic">night-hog,</hi> tawny as a <lb/>
                    moor, the eye of a gipsy, low in stature, contemptibly <reg orig="di-|minutive"
                        >diminutive</reg>, <lb/> scarcely bulk enough to cast a shadow as she <lb/>
                    walks, less luxuriance than a charred log, fewer elasticities <lb/> than a sheet
                    pebble.</p>
                <p>Hush! hush! blasphemer!&mdash;and I put my hand before <lb/> his mouth&mdash;have
                    I not told you that in mind, person, and <lb/> condition, she is the type after
                    which my enamored fancy <lb/> has modelled my wife?</p>
                <p>O ho! Then the objection does not lie with you. It lies <lb/> with her, it seems.
                    She can find nothing in you to esteem! <lb/> And pray, for what faults do you
                    think she would reject <lb/> you?</p>
                <p>I cannot tell. That she can ever balance for a moment, <lb/> on such a question,
                    is incredible. <hi rend="italic">Me! Me!</hi> That Achsa <lb/> Fielding should
                    think of me!</p>
                <p>Incredible, indeed! You who are loathsome in your <reg orig="per-|son"
                        >person</reg>, <lb/> an ideot in your understanding, a villain in your
                    morals! <lb/> deformed! withered! vain, stupid, and malignant. That <lb/> such a
                    one should choose <hi rend="italic">you</hi> for an idol!</p>
                <pb n="196" entity="eaf033v2_0405" pid="uva-lib:349712"/>
                <p>Pray, my friend, said I anxiously, jest not. What mean <lb/> you by a hint of
                    this kind!</p>
                <p>I will not jest then, but will soberly inquire, what faults <lb/> are they which
                    make this lady's choice of you so incredible? <lb/> You are younger than she,
                    though no one, who merely <lb/> observed your manners, and heard you talk, would
                    take <lb/> you to be under thirty. You are poor; are these <reg
                        orig="imped-|iments">impediments</reg>?</p>
                <p>I should think not. I have heard her reason with <reg orig="admi-|rable"
                        >admirable</reg>
                    <lb/> eloquence, against the vain distinctions of property <lb/> and nation, and
                    rank. They were once of moment in her <lb/> eyes; but the sufferings,
                    humiliations, and reflections of <lb/> years, have cured her of the folly. Her
                    nation has suffered <lb/> too much by the inhuman antipathies of religious and
                        <reg orig="politi-|cal">political</reg>
                    <lb/> faction; she, herself, has felt so often the contumelies of <lb/> the
                    rich, the high-born, and the bigoted, that&mdash;</p>
                <p>Prythee, then, what dost imagine her objections to be?</p>
                <p>Why&mdash;I don't know. The thought was so aspiring; to <lb/> call her <hi
                        rend="italic">my wife,</hi> was an height of bliss; the very far off <lb/>
                    view of which made my head dizzy.</p>
                <p>An height, however, to attain which you suppose only her <lb/> consent, her love,
                    to be necessary?</p>
                <p>Without doubt, her love is indispensable.</p>
                <p>Sit down, Arthur, and let us no longer treat this matter <lb/> lightly. I clearly
                    see the importance of this moment to <lb/> this lady's happiness and yours. It
                    is plain that you love <lb/> this woman. How could you help it? A brilliant skin
                    is not <lb/> her's; nor elegant proportions; nor majectic stature; yet no <lb/>
                    creature had ever more power to bewitch. Her manners <lb/> have grace and
                    dignity that flow from exquisite feeling, <reg orig="deli-|cate">delicate</reg>
                    <lb/> taste, and the quickest and keenest penetration. She <lb/> has the wisdom
                    of men and of books. Her sympathies are <lb/> enforced by reason, and her
                    charities regulated by <reg orig="know-|ledge">knowledge</reg>. <lb/> She has a
                    woman's age, fortune more than you wish, <lb/> and a spotless fame. How could
                    you fail to love her?</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">You,</hi> who are her chosen friend, who partake her <reg
                        orig="plea-|sures">pleasures</reg>, <lb/> and share her employments, on whom
                    she almost <reg orig="ex-|clusively">exclusively</reg>
                    <lb/> bestows her society and confidence, and to whom <lb/> she thus affords the

                    <lb/> esteem. How could you, with all that firmness of <lb/>
                    <pb n="197" entity="eaf033v2_0406" pid="uva-lib:349713"/> love, joined with all
                    that discernment of her excellence, how <lb/> could you escape the
                    enchantment?</p>
                <p>You have not thought of marriage. You have not <reg orig="sus-|pected"
                        >suspected</reg>
                    <lb/> your love. From the purity of your mind, from the <lb/> idolatry with
                    which this woman has inspired you, you have <lb/> imagined no delight beyond
                    that of enjoying her society as <lb/> you now do, and have never fostered a hope
                    beyond this <lb/> privilege.</p>
                <p>How quickly would this tranquillity vanish, and the true <lb/> state of your
                    heart be evinced, if a rival should enter the <lb/> scene and be entertained
                    with preference; then would the <lb/> seal be removed, the spell be broken, and
                    you would awaken <lb/> to terror and to anguish.</p>
                <p>Of this, however, there is no danger. Your passion is <lb/> not felt by you
                    alone. From her treatment of you, your <lb/> diffidence disables you from
                    seeing, but nothing can be clearer <lb/> to me than, that she loves you.</p>
                <p>I started on my feet. A flush of scorching heat flowed <lb/> to every part of my
                    frame. My temples began to throb <lb/> like my heart. I was half delirious, and
                    my delirium was <lb/> strangely compounded of fear and hope, of delight and of
                    <lb/> terror.</p>
                <p>What have you done, my friend? You have overturned <lb/> my peace of mind. Till
                    now the image of this woman has <lb/> been followed by complacency and sober
                    rapture; but your <lb/> words have dashed the scene with dismay and confusion.
                    <lb/> You have raised up wishes, and dreams, and doubts, which <lb/> possess me
                    in spite of my reason, in spite of a thousand <lb/> proofs.</p>
                <p>Good God! You say she loves; loves <hi rend="italic">me!</hi> me, a boy in <lb/>
                    age; bred in clownish ignorance; scarcely ushered into the <lb/> world; more

                    be. Yet, if it were; if <lb/> your guesses should&mdash;prove&mdash;Oaf! madman!
                    To indulge <lb/> so fatal a chimera! So rash a dream!</p>
                <p>My friend! my friend! I feel that you have done me an <lb/> irreparable injury. I
                    can never more look her in the face. I <lb/>
                    <pb n="198" entity="eaf033v2_0407" pid="uva-lib:349714"/> can never more

                    innocent joy, <lb/> unconscious of offence, and knowing no restraint, which
                    <lb/> have hitherto been my titles to her favor, will fly from my <lb/> features
                    and manners. I shall be anxious, vacant and <reg orig="un-|happy">unhappy</reg>
                    <lb/> in her presence. I shall dread to look at her, or to <lb/> open my lips
                    lest my mad and unhallowed ambition should <lb/> betray itself.</p>
                <p>Well, replied Stevens, this scene is quite new. I could <lb/> almost find it in
                    my heart to pity you. I did not expect <lb/> this; and yet from my knowledge of
                    your character, I ought, <lb/> perhaps, to have foreseen it. This is a necessary
                    part of <lb/> the drama. A joyous certainty, on these occasions, must <lb/>
                    always be preceded by suspenses and doubts, and the close <lb/> will be joyous
                    in proportion as the preludes are excruciating. <lb/> Go to bed, my good friend,
                    and think of this. Time and a <lb/> few more interviews with Mrs. Fielding,
                    will, I doubt not, <lb/> set all to rights.</p>

                <p><hi rend="small-caps">I went</hi> to my chamber, but what different sensations
                    did <lb/> I carry into it, from those with which I had left it a few <lb/> hours
                    before. I stretched myself on the mattress and put <lb/> out the light; but the
                    swarm of new images that rushed on <lb/> my mind, set me again instantly in
                    motion. All was rapid, <lb/> vague and undefined, wearying and distracting my
                    attention. <lb/> I was roused as by a divine voice, that said:&mdash;"Sleep no
                    <lb/> more; Mervyn shall sleep no more."</p>
                <p>What chiefly occupied me was a nameless sort of terror. <lb/> What shall I
                    compare it to? Methinks, that one falling from <lb/> a tree, overhanging a
                    torrent, plunged into the whirling eddy, <lb/> and gasping and struggling while
                    he sinks to rise no more, <lb/> would feel just as I did then. Nay, some such
                    image <lb/> actually possessed me. Such was one of my reveries, in <lb/> which,
                    suddenly, I stretched my hand, and caught the arm <lb/> of a chair. This act
                    called me back to reason, or rather <lb/>
                    <pb n="199" entity="eaf033v2_0408" pid="uva-lib:349715"/> gave my soul
                    opportunity to roam into a new track equally <lb/> wild.</p>
                <p>Was it the abruptness of this vision that thus confounded <lb/> me! was it a
                    latent error in my moral constitution, which <lb/> this new conjuncture drew
                    forth into influence? These were <lb/> all the tokens of a mind lost to itself;
                    bewildered; <reg orig="un-|hinged">unhinged</reg>; <lb/> plunged into a drear
                    insanity.</p>
                <p>Nothing less could have prompted so phantastically&mdash;for <lb/> midnight as it
                    was, my chamber's solitude was not to be <lb/> supported. After a few turns
                    across the floor, I left the <lb/> room, and the house. I walked without design
                    and in a <lb/> hurried pace. I posted straight to the house of Mrs. <reg
                        orig="Field-|ing">Fielding</reg>. <lb/> I lifted the latch, but the door did
                    not open. It was, <lb/> no doubt, locked.</p>
                <p>How comes this, said I, and looked around me. The hour <lb/> and occasion were
                    unthought of. Habituated to this path, <lb/> I had taken it spontaneously. How
                    comes this? repeated <lb/> I. Locked upon <hi rend="italic">me!</hi> but I will
                    summon them, I warrant <lb/> me&mdash;and rung the bell, not timidly or
                    slightly, but with <lb/> violence. Some one hastened from above. I saw the <lb/>
                    glimmer of a candle through the key-hole.</p>
                <p>Strange, thought I, a candle at noon day!&mdash;The door was <lb/> opened, and my
                    poor Bess, robed in a careless and hasty <lb/> manner, appeared. She started at
                    sight of me, but <lb/> merely because she did not, in a moment, recognise
                    me.&mdash; <lb/> Ah! Arthur, is it you? Come in. My mamma has wanted <lb/> you
                    these two hours. I was just going to despatch Philip to <lb/> tell you to
                    come.</p>
                <p>Lead me to her, said I.</p>
                <p>She led the way into the parlor.&mdash;"Wait a moment <lb/> here; I will tell her
                    you are come"&mdash;and she tripped <lb/> away.</p>
                <p>Presently a step was heard. The door opened again, <lb/> and then entered a man.
                    He was tall, elegant, sedate to a <lb/> degree of sadness; something in his
                    dress and aspect that <lb/> bespoke the foreigner; the Frenchman.</p>
                <p>What, said he, mildly, is your business with my wife? <lb/> She cannot see you
                    instantly, and has sent me to receive <lb/> your commands.</p>
                <p>Your <hi rend="italic">wife!</hi> I want Mrs. Fielding.</p>
                <p>True; and Mrs. Fielding is my wife. Thank <reg orig="Hea-|ven">Heaven</reg>
                    <lb/>
                    <pb n="200" entity="eaf033v2_0409" pid="uva-lib:349716"/> I have come in time to
                    discover her, and claim her <lb/> as such.</p>
                <p>I started back. I shuddered. My joints slackened, and <lb/> I stretched my hand
                    to catch something by which I might <lb/> be saved from sinking on the floor.
                    Meanwhile, Fielding <lb/> changed his countenance into rage and fury. He called
                    <lb/> me villain! bade me avaunt! and drew a shining steel from <lb/> his bosom,
                    with which he stabbed me to the heart. I sunk <lb/> upon the floor, and all, for
                    a time, was darkness and <reg orig="obliv-|ion">oblivion</reg>! <lb/> At length,
                    I returned as it were to life. I opened my <lb/> eyes. The mists disappeared,
                    and I found myself <reg orig="stretch-|ed">stretched</reg>
                    <lb/> upon the bed in my own chamber. I remembered the <lb/> fatal blow I had
                    received. I put my hand upon my breast; <lb/> the spot where the dagger entered.
                    There were no traces <lb/> of a wound. All was perfect and entire. Some miracle
                    <lb/> had made me whole.</p>
                <p>I raised myself up. I re-examined my body. All around <lb/> me was hushed, till a
                    voice from the pavement below, <reg orig="pro-|claimed">proclaimed</reg>
                    <lb/> that it was "past three o'clock."</p>
                <p>What, said I, has all this miserable pageantry, this midnight <lb/> wandering,
                    and this ominous interview, been no more <lb/> than&mdash;<hi rend="italic">a
                        dream!</hi></p>
                <p>It may be proper to mention, in explanation of this scene, <lb/> and to shew the
                    thorough perturbation of my mind, during <lb/> this night, intelligence gained
                    some days after from Eliza. <lb/> She said, that about two o'clock, on this
                    night, she was <lb/> roused by a violent ringing of the bell. She was startled
                    <lb/> by so unseasonable a summons. She slept in a chamber <lb/> adjoining Mrs.
                    Fielding's, and hesitated whether she should <lb/> alarm her friend, but the
                    summons not being repeated, she <lb/> had determined to forbear.</p>
                <p>Added to this, was the report of Mrs. Stevens, who, on <lb/> the same night,
                    about half an hour after I and her husband <lb/> had retired, imagined that she
                    heard the street door opened <lb/> and shut, but this being followed by no other
                    consequence, <lb/> she supposed herself mistaken. I have little doubt, that,
                    <lb/> in my feverish and troubled sleep, I actually went forth, <reg
                        orig="post-|ed">posted</reg>
                    <lb/> to the house of Mrs. Fielding, rung for admission, and <lb/> shortly
                    after, returned to my own apartment.</p>
                <p>This confusion of mind was somewhat allayed by, the <lb/> return of light. It
                    gave way to more uniform, but not less <lb/>
                    <pb n="201" entity="eaf033v2_0410" pid="uva-lib:349717">

                    </pb> rueful and despondent perceptions. The image of Achsa <lb/> filled my
                    fancy, but it was the harbinger of nothing but <reg orig="hu-|miliation"
                        >humiliation</reg>
                    <lb/> and sorrow. To outroot the conviction of my <lb/> own unworthiness, to
                    persuade myself that I was regarded <lb/> with the tenderness that Stevens has
                    ascribed to her, that <lb/> the discovery of my thoughts would not excite her
                    anger and <lb/> grief, I felt to be impossible.</p>
                <p>In this state of mind, I could not see her. To declare <lb/> my feelings would
                    produce indignation and anguish; to <lb/> hide them from her scrutiny was not in
                    my power; yet, <lb/> what would she think of my estranging myself from her <lb/>
                    society? What expedient could I honestly adopt to justify <lb/> my absence, and
                    what employments could I substitute for <lb/> those precious hours hitherto
                    devoted to her.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">This</hi> afternoon, thought I, she has been invited to spend
                    at <lb/> Stedman's country house on Schuylkill. She consented <lb/> to go, and I
                    was to accompany her. I am fit only for <reg orig="soli-|tude">solitude</reg>.
                    <lb/> My behaviour, in her presence, will be enigmatical, <lb/> capricious and
                    morose. I must not go; yet, what will <lb/> she think of my failure? Not to go
                    will be injurious and <lb/> suspicious.</p>
                <p>I was undetermined. The appointed hour arrived. I <lb/> stood at my chamber
                    window, torn by a variety of purposes, <lb/> and swayed alternately by repugnant
                    arguments. I several <lb/> times went to the door of my apartment, and put my
                    foot <lb/> upon the first step of the stair-case, but as often paused, <lb/>
                    reconsidered and returned to my room.</p>
                <p>In these fluctuations the hour passed. No messenger <lb/> arrived from Mrs.
                    Fielding, inquiring into the cause of my <lb/> delay. Was she offended at my
                    negligence? Was she <lb/> sick and disabled from going, or had she changed her
                    mind? <lb/> I now remembered her parting words at our last interview. <lb/> Were
                    they not susceptible of two constructions? She said <lb/> my visit was too long,
                    and bade me begone. Did she suspect <lb/> my presumption, and is she determined
                    thus to punish me?</p>
                <p>This terror added anew to all my former anxieties. It <lb/> was impossible to
                    rest in this suspense. I would go to her <lb/> I would lay before her all the
                    anguish of my heart; I would <lb/> not spare myself. She shall not reproach me
                    more <reg orig="severe-|ly">severely</reg>
                    <lb/> than I will reproach myself. I will hear my sentence <lb/>
                    <pb n="202" entity="eaf033v2_0411" pid="uva-lib:349718"/> from her own lips, and
                    promise unlimited submission to <lb/> the doom of separation and exile, which
                    she will pronounce.</p>
                <p>I went forth to her house. The drawing-room and <reg orig="sum-|mer-house"
                        >summer-house</reg>
                    <lb/> were empty. I summoned Philip the footman&mdash; <lb/> his mistress was
                    gone to Mr. Stedman's.</p>
                <p>How?&mdash;To Stedman's?&mdash;In whose company?</p>
                <p>Miss Stedman and her brother called for her in the <reg orig="car-|riage"
                        >carriage</reg>, <lb/> and persuaded her to go with them.</p>
                <p>Now my heart sunk, indeed! Miss Stedman's <hi rend="italic">brother!</hi>
                    <lb/> A youth, forward, gallant and gay! Flushed with <reg orig="prosper-|ity"
                        >prosperity</reg>, <lb/> and just returned from Europe, with all the
                    confidence <lb/> of age, and all the ornaments of education! She has gone <lb/>
                    with him, though pre-engaged to me! Poor Arthur, how <lb/> art thou
                    despised!</p>
                <p>This information only heightened my impatience. I went <lb/> away, but returned
                    in the evening. I waited till eleven, but <lb/> she came not back. I cannot
                    justly paint the interval that <lb/> passed till next morning. It was void of
                    sleep. On leaving <lb/> her house, I wandered into the fields. Every moment <reg
                        orig="in-|creased">increased</reg>
                    <lb/> my impatience. She will probably spend the <reg orig="mor-|row"
                        >morrow</reg>
                    <lb/> at Stedman's, said I, and possibly the next day. Why <lb/> should I wait
                    for her return? Why not seek her there, and <lb/> rid myself at once of this
                    agonizing suspense? Why not <lb/> go thither now? This night, wherever I spend
                    it, will be <lb/> unacquainted with repose. I will go, it is already near <lb/>
                    twelve, and the distance is more than eight miles. I will <lb/> hover near the
                    house till morning, and then, as early as <reg orig="pos-|sible">possible</reg>,
                    <lb/> demand an interview.</p>
                <p>I was well acquainted with Stedman's Villa, having <lb/> formerly been there with
                    Mrs. Fielding. I quickly <reg orig="en-|tered">entered</reg>
                    <lb/> its precincts. I went close to the house; looked <lb/> mournfully at every
                    window. At one of them a light <lb/> was to be seen, and I took various stations
                    to discover, <lb/> if possible, the persons within. Methought once I caught
                    <lb/> a glimpse of a female, whom my fancy easily imagined to <lb/> be Achsa. I
                    sat down upon the lawn, some hundred feet <lb/> from the house, and opposite the
                    window whence the light <lb/> proceeded. I watched it, till at length some one
                    came to <lb/> the window, lifted it, and leaning on her arms, continued to <lb/>
                    look out.</p>
                <pb n="203" entity="eaf033v2_0412" pid="uva-lib:349719"/>
                <p>The preceding day had been a very sultry one; the night, <lb/> as usual after
                    such a day, and the fall of a violent shower, <lb/> was delightfully serene and
                    pleasant. Where I stood, was <lb/> enlightened by the moon. Whether she saw me
                    or not, I <lb/> could hardly tell, or whether she distinguished any thing but
                    <lb/> a human figure.</p>
                <p>Without reflecting on what was due to decorum and <lb/> punctilio, I immediately
                    drew near the house. I quickly <lb/> perceived that her attention was fixed.
                    Neither of us <lb/> spoke, till I had placed myself directly under her; I then
                    <lb/> opened my lips, without knowing in what manner to <reg orig="ad-|dress"
                        >address</reg>
                    <lb/> her. She spoke first, and in a startled and anxious <lb/> voice&mdash;</p>
                <p>Who is that?</p>
                <p>Arthur Mervyn; he that was two days ago your friend.</p>
                <p>Mervyn! What is it that brings you here at this hour? <lb/> What is the matter?
                    What has happened? Is any body <lb/> sick?</p>
                <p>All is safe&mdash;all are in good health.</p>
                <p>What then do you come hither for at such an hour?</p>
                <p>I meant not to disturb you; I meant not be seen.</p>
                <p>Good Heavens! How you frighten me. What can be <lb/> the reason of so
                    strange&mdash;</p>
                <p>Be not alarmed. I meant to hover near the house till <lb/> morning, that I might
                    see you as early as possible.</p>
                <p>For what purpose?</p>
                <p>I will tell you when we meet, and let that be at five <lb/> o'clock; the sun will
                    then be risen; in the cedar grove <lb/> under the bank; till when, farewell.</p>
                <p>Having said this, I prevented all expostulation, by turning <lb/> the angle of
                    the house, and hastening towards the shore of <lb/> the river. I roved about the
                    grove that I have mentioned. <lb/> In one part of it is a rustic seat and table,
                    shrouded by trees <lb/> and shrubs, and an intervening eminence, from the view
                    of <lb/> those in the house. This I designed to be the closing scene <lb/> of my
                    destiny.</p>
                <p>Presently, I left this spot, and wandered upward through <lb/> embarrassed and
                    obscure paths, starting forward or checking <lb/> my pace, according as my
                    wayward meditations governed <lb/> me. Shall I describe my
                    thoughts?&mdash;Impossible! It was <lb/> certainly a temporary loss of reason;
                    nothing less than <lb/>
                    <pb n="204" entity="eaf033v2_0413" pid="uva-lib:349720"/> madness could lead
                    into such devious tracts, drag me down <lb/> to so hopeless, helpless, panicful
                    a depth, and drag me <lb/> down so suddenly; lay waste, as at a signal, all my
                        <reg orig="flourish-|ing">flourishing</reg>
                    <lb/> structures, and reduce them in a moment to a scene of <lb/> confusion and
                    horror.</p>
                <p>What did I fear? What did I hope? What did I <reg orig="de-|sign">design</reg>?
                    <lb/> I cannot tell; my glooms were to retire with the <lb/> night. The point to
                    which every tumultuous feeling was <lb/> linked, was the coming interview with
                    Achsa. That was <lb/> the boundary of fluctuation and suspense. Here was the
                    <lb/> sealing and ratification of my doom.</p>
                <p>I rent a passage through the thicket, and struggled <reg orig="up-|ward"
                        >upward</reg>
                    <lb/> till I reached the edge of a considerable precipice; <lb/> I laid me down
                    at my length upon the rock, whose cold <lb/> and hard surface I pressed with my
                    bared and throbbing <lb/> breast. I leaned over the edge; fixed my eyes upon the
                    <lb/> water, and wept&mdash;plentifully; but why?</p>
                <p>May <hi rend="italic">this</hi> be my heart's last beat, if I can tell why.</p>
                <p>I had wandered so far from Stedman's, that when roused <lb/> by the light, I had
                    some miles to walk before I could reach <lb/> the place of meeting. Achsa was
                    already there. I slid <lb/> down the rock above, and appeared before her. Well
                    <lb/> might she be startled at my wild and abrupt appearance.</p>
                <p>I placed myself, without uttering a word, upon a seat <reg orig="op-|posite"
                        >opposite</reg>
                    <lb/> to her, the table between, and crossing my arms upon <lb/> the table,
                    leaned my head upon them, while my face was <lb/> turned towards and my eyes
                    fixed upon hers. I seemed to <lb/> have lost the power and the inclination to
                    speak.</p>
                <p>She regarded me, at first, with anxious curiosity? after <lb/> examining my
                    looks, every emotion was swallowed up in <reg orig="ter-|rified">terrified</reg>
                    <lb/> sorrow. For God's sake!&mdash;what does all this mean? <lb/> Why am I
                    called to this place? What tidings, what fearful <lb/> tidings do you bring?</p>
                <p>I did not change my posture or speak. What, she <reg orig="re-|sumed"
                        >resumed</reg>, <lb/> could inspire all this wo? Keep me not in this <reg
                        orig="sus-|pense">suspense</reg>, <lb/> Arthur; these looks and this silence
                    shock and <reg orig="af-|flict">afflict</reg>
                    <lb/> me too much.</p>
                <p>Afflict you? said I, at last; I come to tell you, what, now <lb/> that I am here,
                    I cannot tell&mdash;there I stopped.</p>
                <p>Say what, I entreat you. You seem to be very <reg orig="unhap-|py&mdash;such"
                        >unhappy&mdash;such</reg>
                    <lb/> a change&mdash;from yesterday!</p>
                <pb n="205" entity="eaf033v2_0414" pid="uva-lib:349721"/>
                <p>Yes! From yesterday; all then was a joyous calm, and <lb/> now all is&mdash;but
                    then I knew not my infamy, my guilt&mdash;</p>
                <p>What words are these, and from you, Arthur? Guilt is to <lb/> you impossible. If
                    purity is to be found on earth, it is <lb/> lodged in your heart. What have you
                    done?</p>
                <p>I have dared&mdash;how little you expect the extent of my <lb/> daring. That such
                    as I should look upwards with this <lb/> ambition.</p>
                <p>I stood up, and taking her hands in mine, as she sat, <lb/> looked earnestly in
                    her face&mdash;I come only to beseech your <lb/> pardon. To tell you my crime,
                    and then disappear <reg orig="for-|ever">forever</reg>; <lb/> but first let me
                    see if there be any omen of <reg orig="forgive-|ness">forgiveness</reg>. <lb/>
                    Your looks&mdash;they are kind; heavenly; <reg orig="compassion-|ate"
                        >compassionate</reg>
                    <lb/> still. I will trust them, I believe; and yet&mdash;letting go <lb/> her
                    hands, and turning away.&mdash;This offence is beyond the <lb/> reach even of
                        <hi rend="italic">your</hi> mercy.</p>
                <p>How beyond measure these words and this deportment <lb/> distress me! Let me know
                    the worst; I cannot bear to be <lb/> thus perplexed.</p>
                <p>Why, said I, turning quickly round, and again taking her <lb/> hands, that
                    Mervyn, whom you have honored and confided <lb/> in, and blessed with your sweet
                    regards, has been&mdash;</p>
                <p>What has be been? Divinely amiable, heroic in his virtue, <lb/> I am sure. What
                    else has he been?</p>
                <p>This Mervyn has imagined, has dared&mdash;Will you forgive <lb/> him?</p>
                <p>Forgive you what? Why don't you speak? Keep not my <lb/> soul in this
                    suspense.</p>
                <p>He has dared&mdash;But do not think that I am he. Continue <lb/> to look as now,
                    and reserve your killing glances, the <reg orig="ven-|geance">vengeance</reg>
                    <lb/> of those eyes as for one that is absent.&mdash;Why, <lb/> what&mdash;You
                    weep, then, at last. That is a propitious sign. <lb/> When pity drops from the
                    eyes of our judge, then should <lb/> the suppliant approach. Now, in confidence
                    of pardon, I <lb/> will tell you; this Mervyn, not content with all you have
                    <lb/> hitherto granted him, has dared&mdash;to <hi rend="italic">love</hi> you;
                    nay, to think <lb/> of you, as of <hi rend="italic">his wife!</hi></p>
                <p>Her eye sunk beneath mine, and disengaging her hands, <lb/> covered her face with
                    them.</p>
                <p>I see my fate, said I, in a tone of despair. Too well did <lb/>
                    <pb n="206" entity="eaf033v2_0415" pid="uva-lib:349722"/> I predict the effect
                    of this confession; but I will go&mdash;<hi rend="italic">and <lb/>
                        unforgiven.</hi></p>
                <p>She now partly uncovered her face. The hand withdrawn <lb/> from her cheek, and
                    stretched towards me. She looked at <lb/> me.</p>
                <p>Arthur! I <hi rend="italic">do</hi> forgive thee.&mdash;With what accents was
                    this <lb/> uttered! With what looks! The cheek that was before <lb/> pale with
                    terror, was now crimsoned over by a different <lb/> emotion, and delight swam in
                    her eye.</p>
                <p>Could I mistake? My doubts, my new born fears made <lb/> me tremble, while I took
                    the offered hand.</p>
                <p>Surely&mdash;faltered I, I am not&mdash;I cannot be&mdash;so blessed.</p>
                <p>There was no need of words. The hand that I held, was <lb/> sufficiently
                    eloquent. She was still silent.</p>
                <p>Surely, said I, my senses deceive me. A bliss like this <lb/> cannot be reserved
                    for me. Tell me, once more&mdash;set my <lb/> doubting heart at rest.&mdash;</p>
                <p>She now gave herself to my arms&mdash;I have not words&mdash; <lb/> Let your own
                    heart tell you, you have made your Achsa&mdash;</p>
                <p>At this moment, a voice from without, it was Miss <reg orig="Sted-|man's"
                        >Stedman's</reg>, <lb/> called&mdash;Mrs. Fielding! where are you?</p>
                <p>My friend started up, and in a hasty voice, bade me <reg orig="be-|gone"
                        >begone</reg>! <lb/> You must not be seen by this giddy girl. Come <lb/>
                    hither this evening, as if by my appointment, and I will return <lb/> with
                    you.&mdash;She left me in a kind of trance. I was <reg orig="immov-|able"
                        >immovable</reg>. <lb/> My reverie was too delicious;&mdash;but let me not
                    <lb/> attempt the picture. If I can convey no image of my state, <lb/> previous
                    to this interview, my subsequent feelings are still <lb/> more beyond the reach
                    of my powers to describe.</p>
                <p>Agreeably to the commands of my mistress, I hastened <lb/> away, evading paths
                    which might expose me to <reg orig="observa-|tion">observation</reg>. <lb/> I
                    speedily made my friends partake of my joy, and <lb/> passed the day in a state
                    of solemn but confused rapture. <lb/> I did not accurately portray the various
                    parts of my felicity. <lb/> The whole rushed upon my soul at once. My
                    conceptions <lb/> were too rapid, and too comprehensive to be distinct.</p>
                <p>I went to Stedman's in the evening. I found in the <reg orig="ac-|cents"
                        >accents</reg>
                    <lb/> and looks of my Achsa new assurances that all which <lb/> had lately
                    passed was more than a dream. She made <reg orig="ex-|cuses">excuses</reg>
                    <lb/> for leaving the Stedmans' sooner than ordinary, and <lb/> was accompanied
                    to the city by her friend. We dropped <lb/>
                    <pb n="207" entity="eaf033v2_0416" pid="uva-lib:349723"/> Mrs. Fielding at her
                    own house, and thither, after <reg orig="accompa-|nying">accompanying</reg>
                    <lb/> Miss Stedman to her own home, I returned upon the <lb/> wings of tremulous
                    impatience.</p>
                <p>Now could I repeat every word of every conversation that <lb/> has since taken
                    place between us; but why should I do that <lb/> on paper? Indeed it could not
                    be done. All is of equal <lb/> value, and all could not be comprised but in many
                    volumes. <lb/> There needs nothing more deeply to imprint it on my <lb/> memory;
                    and while thus reviewing the past, I should be <lb/> iniquitously neglecting the
                    present. What is given to the <lb/> pen, would be taken from her; and that,
                    indeed, would <lb/> be&mdash;but no need of saying what it would be, since it is
                        <reg orig="im-|possible">impossible</reg>.</p>
                <p>I merely write to allay these tumults which our necessary <lb/> separation
                    produces; to aid me in calling up a little patience, <lb/> till the time
                    arrives, when our persons, like our minds, shall <lb/> be united forever. That
                    time&mdash;may nothing happen to <lb/> prevent&mdash;but nothing can happen. But
                    why this ominous <lb/> misgiving just now? My love has infected me with these
                    <lb/> unworthy terrors, for she has them too.</p>
                <p>This morning I was relating my dream to her. She <lb/> started, and grew pale. A
                    sad silence ensued the <reg orig="cheer-|fulness">cheerfulness</reg>
                    <lb/> that had reigned before&mdash;why thus dejected, my <lb/> friend?</p>
                <p>I hate your dream. It is a horrid thought. Would to <lb/> God it had never
                    occurred to you.</p>
                <p>Why surely you place no confidence in dreams.</p>
                <p>I know not where to place confidence; not in my present <lb/> promises of
                    joy&mdash;and she wept. I endeavored to soothe or <lb/> console her. Why, I
                    asked, did she weep.</p>
                <p>My heart is sore. Former disappointments were so <lb/> heavy; the hopes which
                    were blasted, were so like my <lb/> present ones, that the dread of a like
                    result, will intrude <lb/> upon my thoughts. And now your dream! Indeed, I know
                    <lb/> not what to do. I believe I ought still to retract&mdash;ought, at <lb/>
                    least, to postpone an act so irrevocable.</p>
                <p>Now was I obliged again to go over my catalogue of <lb/> arguments to induce her
                    to confirm her propitious resolution <lb/> to be mine within the week. I, at
                    last, succeeded, even in <lb/> restoring her serenity, and beguiling her fears
                    by dwelling <lb/> on our future happiness.</p>

                <p>Our household, while we staid in America&mdash;in a year or <lb/> two we hie to

                    <lb/> Duties which should be light and regular.&mdash;Such and such <lb/> should
                    be our amusements and employments abroad and at <lb/> home, and would not this

                <p>O yes&mdash;if it may be so.</p>
                <p>It shall be so; but this is but the humble outline of the <lb/> scene; something
                    is still to be added to complete our felicity.</p>
                <p>What more can be added!</p>
                <p>What more? Can Achsa ask what more? She who has <lb/> not been <hi rend="italic"

                <p>But why am I indulging this pen prattle? The hour she <lb/> fixed for my return

                    leathern case, till I call <lb/> for thee, and that will not be very soon. I
                    believe I will <lb/> abjure thy company till all is settled with my love. Yes; I <lb/>
