            <p>
            Your last letter was very 
            sweet and exceptionally welcome.  It
            seems such a long time since I’d
            heard from you.
            </p><p>
            As you know by this time
            poor, fine, old Chapman is gone.  He
            was the best and bravest of us
            all and his death has been a
            terrible blow to all of us.
            </p><p>
            There were but a few who
            went out this afternoon.  Five in all,
            because yesterday we had a number of
            smashes, I for one.  I had landed and
            was on the field when Rumsey came
            swooping down and hit me.  Both
            of our machines were injured.  Then
            after that there was an alert and
            three more broke on landing in the
            dusk.  The five that went out got
            mixed up in a fight over the German
            lines against superior numbers.  Chapman
            fought furiously.  After the combat
            he was not to be seen.  Another
            escadrille was out and a pilot
            from it signaled a Nieuport he
            had seen fall.  Chapman was
            late but we thought he had
            landed at a field near by in order
            to visit Balsley.  He had put a sack
            (over)
                        
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0368" n="[p.2]"/>
            
            of oranges in his machine to take to
            Balsley after the evening sortie had
            finished.  I remember discussing the
            wind with Victor just before he left
            as he wanted to decide on the best
            way to land at the field.  Then
            he asked me if I could see the
            other machines above circling for the 
            start.  That was the last I
            saw of the poor boy.  Finally
            after we had called up all the 
            aviation fields around an observer
            of a German plane phoned in.  He
            was flying very high and had
            seen the fight.  He reported
            that he had seen a Nieuport
            head downwards, go into a cork-screw 
            and that the wings had
            folded up and the machine dropped
            like a stone into the German lines.
            </p><p>
            I liked Victor better than anyone
            in the escadrille &mdash; about the same as
            Bill Thaw &mdash; and I feel rotten about
            his death.  He was an exceptional
            man from every stand point and a
            pilot that was as skilful [sic] and as
            brave as any in the war.  He
            was charming all the way thru [sic]
            and some how it was just like
            him to have been killed while he
            was taking oranges to a wounded
                        
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0369" n="[p.3]"/>
            
            comrade.
            </p><p>
            I’m glad you are having your
            vacation and happy to know that
            its so long.  Be sure and keep
            me posted on the dates you are
            to be out of Paris for I do
            not want to have my “permission”
            fall at that time.  Its going to
            be so nice to see you again,
            Marcelle.  Its going to seem even
            better than when I came back
            after the Ambulance work for this
            business is so much more serious.
            </p><p>
            Paul has moved again.  This
            time to 80 Rue Boissiere as you
            doubtless know.
            </p><p>
            I’m sorry to hear our Russian
            friend is ill.  Queer to have scarlet
            fever at her age, isn’t it?
            </p><p>
            You’ve probably seen Walter by
            this time and he being so much
            finer that the rest of us you’ll
            forget me and I won’t have
            any letters for awhile.  xxx
            </p><p>
            The phone has just rung.  The
            Direction has phoned that Balsley is
            dying.  It is an awful shame.  I
            have waked up the Captain and
            Kiffin and we are going over to see
            him.  It is raining and late and it
            seems to make it more horrible.  The
                        
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0370" n="[p.4]"/>
            
            poor boy.
            </p><p>
            Kiffin says to give you
            his best.  He’s not the time to
            write but means well just
            the same.
            </p><p>
            We won’t be back until 3
            in the morning but we’ve a sortie
            soon after.  
            </p>

            Queer we found Balsley better
            instead of worse.  Had blow outs and
            things and didn’t return until 5. A.M.
            Fortunately it was cloudy and we made 
            no sortie.
