<head>PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION</head> 
 
<p>IT is exceedingly gratifying to me that a second edition of this book 
should be called for. But still more welcome is the change in the 
attitude of the educated world towards the old-time alchemists and their 
theories which has taken place during the past few years. 
 
</p><p>The theory of the origin of Alchemy put forward in Chapter I has 
led to considerable discussion; but whilst this theory has met with 
general acceptance, some of its earlier critics took it as implying far 
more than is actually the case. As a result of further research my 
conviction of its truth has become more fully confirmed, and in my 
recent work entitled <hi rend="italic">Bygone Beliefs</hi> (Rider, 1920), under the 
title of "The Quest of the Philosopher's Stone," I have found it 
possible to adduce further evidence in this connection.  At the same 
time, whilst I became increasingly convinced that the main alchemistic 
hypotheses were drawn from the domain of mystical theology and applied 
to physics and chemistry by way of analogy, it also became evident to me 
that the crude physiology of bygone ages and remnants of the old phallic 
faith formed a further and subsidiary source of alchemistic theory. I 
have barely, if at all, touched on this 
 
<pb n="vi"/>  
 
matter in the present work; the reader who is interested will find it 
dealt with in some detail in "The Phallic Element in Alchemical 
Doctrine" in my <hi rend="italic">Bygone Beliefs</hi>. 
 
</p><p>In view of recent research in the domain of Radioactivity and the 
consequent advance in knowledge that has resulted since this book was 
first published, I have carefully considered the advisability of 
rewriting the whole of the last chapter, but came to the conclusion that 
the time for this was not yet ripe, and that, apart from a few minor 
emendations, the chapter had better remain very much as it originally 
stood. My reason for this course was that, whilst considerably more is 
known to-day, than was the case in 1911, concerning the very complex 
transmutations undergone spontaneously by the radioactive 
elements&mdash;knowledge helping further to elucidate the problem of the 
constitution of the so-called "elements" of the chemist&mdash;the problem 
really cognate to my subject, namely that of effecting a transmutation 
of one element into another at will, remains in almost the same state of 
indeterminateness as in 1911. In 1913, Sir William Ramsay<ref target="RedAlchP.1" n="1">1</ref> thought he had obtained evidence for the 
transmutation of hydrogen into helium by the action of the electric 
discharge, and Professors Collie and Patterson 
<ref target="RedAlchP.2" n="2">2</ref> thought they had obtained evidence of the 
 
<pb n="vii"/>  
 
transmutation of hydrogen into neon by similar means.  But these 
observations (as well as Sir William Ramsay's earlier transmutational 
experiments) failed to be satisfactorily confirmed;  
<ref target="RedAlchP.3" n="3">3</ref> and since the death of the latter, little, 
if anything, appears to have been done to settle the questions raised by 
his experiments. Reference must, however, be made to a very interesting 
investigation by Sir Ernest Rutherford on the "Collision of 
&agr;-Particles with Light Atoms,"<ref target="RedAlchP.4" n="4">4</ref> 
from which it appears certain that when bombarded with the 
swiftly-moving &agr;-particles given off by radium-C, the atoms of 
nitrogen may be disintegrated, one of the products being hydrogen. The 
other product is possibly helium,<ref target="RedAlchP.5" n="5">5</ref> 
though this has not been proved. In view of Rutherford's results a 
further repetition of Ramsay's experiments would certainly appear to be 
advisable.</p> 
 
<p>As concerns the spontaneous transmutations undergone by the 
radioactive elements, the facts appear to indicate (or, at least, can be 
brought into some sort of order by supposing) the atom to consist of a 
central nucleus and an outer shell, as suggested by Sir Ernest 
Rutherford. The nucleus may be compared to the sun of a solar system. It 
is excessively small, but in it the mass of the atom is almost entirely 
concentrated.  It is positively charged, the charge being neutralised by 
that of the free electrons which revolve like planets about it, and 
which by their orbits account for the 
 
<pb n="viii"/>  
 
volume of the atom. The atomic weight of the element depends upon the 
central sun; but the chemical properties of the element are determined 
by the number of electrons in the shell; this number is the same as that 
representing the position of the element in the periodic system. 
Radioactive change originates in the atomic nucleus. The expulsion of an 
&agr;-particle therefrom decreases the atomic weight by 4 units, 
necessitates (since the &agr;-particle carries two positive charges) the 
removal of two electrons from the shell in order to maintain electrical 
neutrality, and hence changes the chemical nature of the body, 
transmuting the element into one occupying a position two places to the 
left in the periodic system (for example, the change of radium into 
niton). But radioactivity sometimes results in the expulsion of a 
&bgr;-particle from the nucleus. This results in the addition of an 
electron to the shell, and hence changes the chemical character of the 
element, transmuting it into one occupying a position one place to the 
right in the periodic system, but <hi rend="italic">without altering its atomic 
weight</hi>. Consequently, the expulsion of one &agr;-and two 
&bgr;-particles from the nucleus, whilst decreasing the atomic weight of 
the element by 4, leaves the number of electrons in the shell, and thus 
the chemical properties of the element, unaltered. These remarkable 
conclusions are amply borne out by the facts, and the discovery of 
elements (called "isobares") having the same atomic weight but different 
chemical properties, and of those (called "isotopes") having identical 
chemical characters but different atomic weights, must be regarded as 
one of the most significant and important discoveries of recent years. 
Some further reference 
 
<pb n="ix"/>  
 
to this theory will be found in &sect;&sect; 77 and 81: the reader who 
wishes to follow the matter further should consult the fourth edition of 
Professor Frederick Soddy's <hi rend="italic">The Interpretation of Radium</hi> (1920), 
and the two chapters on the subject in his <hi rend="italic">Science and Life</hi> 
(1920), one of which is a popular exposition and the other a more 
technical one. 
 
</p><p>These advances in knowledge all point to the possibility of 
effecting transmutations at will, but so far attempts to achieve this, 
as I have already indicated, cannot be regarded as altogether 
satisfactory.  Several methods of making gold, or rather elements 
chemically identical with gold, once the method of controlling 
radioactive change is discovered (as assuredly it will be) are suggested 
by Sir Ernest Rutherford's theory of the nuclear atom. Thus, the 
expulsion of two &agr;-particles from bismuth or one from thallium would 
yield the required result. Or lead could be converted into mercury by 
the expulsion of one &agr;-particle, and this into thallium by the 
expulsion of one &bgr;-particle, yielding gold by the further expulsion 
of an &agr;-particle. But, as Professor Soddy remarks in his <hi rend="italic">Science 
and Life</hi> just referred to, "if man ever achieves this further 
control over Nature, it is quite certain that the last thing he would 
want to do would be to turn lead or mercury into gold&mdash;<hi rend="italic">for the sake 
of gold</hi>. The energy that would be liberated, if the control of these 
sub-atomic processes were as possible as is the control of ordinary 
chemical changes, such as combustion, would far exceed in importance and 
value the gold.  Rather it would pay to transmute gold into silver or 
some base metal." 
 
<pb n="x"/>  
 
</p><p>In &sect; 101 of the book I suggest that the question of the 
effect on the world of finance of the discovery of an inexpensive method 
of transmuting base metal into gold on a large scale is one that should 
appeal to a novelist specially gifted with imagination. Since the words 
were first written a work has appeared in which something approximating 
to what was suggested has been attempted and very admirably achieved. My 
reference is to Mr. H. G. Wells's novel, <hi rend="italic">The World Set Free</hi>, 
published in 1914. 
 
</p><p>In conclusion I should like to thank the very many reviewers who 
found so many good things to say concerning the first edition of this 
book. For kind assistance in reading the proofs of this edition my best 
thanks are due also and are hereby tendered to my wife, and my good

<head>PREFACE</head> 
 
<p>THE number of books in the English language dealing with the 
interesting subject of Alchemy is not sufficiently great to render an 
apology necessary for adding thereto. Indeed, at the present time there 
is an actual need for a further contribution on this subject. The time 
is gone when it was regarded as perfectly legitimate to point to Alchemy 
as an instance of the aberrations of the human mind.  Recent 
experimental research has brought about profound modifications in the 
scientific notions regarding the chemical elements, and, indeed, in the 
scientific concept of the physical universe itself; and a certain 
resemblance can be traced between these later views and the theories of 
bygone Alchemy. The spontaneous change of one "element" into another has 
been witnessed, and the recent work of Sir William Ramsay suggests the 
possibility of realising the old alchemistic dream&mdash;the transmutation of 
the "base" metals into gold. 
 
</p><p>The basic idea permeating all the alchemistic theories appears to 
have been this: All the metals (and, indeed, all forms of matter) are 
one in origin, and are produced by an evolutionary process. The Soul of 
them all is one and the same; it is only the 
 
<pb n="xii"/>  
 
Soul that is permanent; the body or outward form, <hi rend="italic">i.e</hi>., the mode 
of manifestation of the Soul, is transitory, and one form may be 
transmuted into another.  The similarity, indeed it might be said, the 
identity, between this view and the modern etheric theory of matter is 
at once apparent. 
 
</p><p>The old alchemists reached the above conclusion by a theoretical 
method, and attempted to demonstrate the validity of their theory by 
means of experiment; in which, it appears, they failed. Modern science, 
adopting the reverse process, for a time lost hold of the idea of the 
unity of the physical universe, to gain it once again by the 
experimental method. It was in the elaboration of this grand fundamental 
idea that Alchemy failed. If I were asked to contrast Alchemy with the 
chemical and physical science of the nineteenth century I would say 
that, whereas the latter abounded in a wealth of much accurate detail 
and much relative truth, it lacked philosophical depth and insight; 
whilst Alchemy, deficient in such accurate detail, was characterised by 
a greater degree of philosophical depth and insight; for the alchemists 
did grasp the fundamental truth of the Cosmos, although they distorted 
it and made it appear grotesque. The alchemists cast their theories in a 
mould entirely fantastic, even ridiculous&mdash;they drew unwarrantable 
analogies&mdash;and hence their views cannot be accepted in these days of 
modern science. But if we cannot approve of their theories <hi rend="italic">in 
toto</hi>, we can nevertheless appreciate the fundamental ideas at the 
root of them. And it is primarily with the object of pointing out this 
similarity between these ancient ideas regarding the physical 
 
<pb n="xiii"/>  
 
universe and the latest products of scientific thought, that this book 
has been written. 
 
</p><p>It is a regrettable fact that the majority of works dealing with 
the subject of Alchemy take a one-sided point of view. The chemists 
generally take a purely physical view of the subject, and instead of 
trying to understand its mystical language, often (I do not say always) 
prefer to label it nonsense and the alchemist a fool. On the other hand, 
the mystics, in many cases, take a purely transcendental view of the 
subject, forgetting the fact that the alchemists were, for the most 
part, concerned with operations of a physical nature. For a proper 
understanding of Alchemy, as I hope to make plain in the first chapter 
of this work, a synthesis of both points of view is essential; and, 
since these two aspects are so intimately and essentially connected with 
one another, this is necessary even when, as in the following work, one 
is concerned primarily with the physical, rather than the purely 
mystical, aspect of the subject. 
 
</p><p>Now, the author of this book may lay claim to being a humble 
student of both Chemistry and what may be generalised under the terms 
Mysticism and Transcendentalism; and he hopes that this perhaps rather 
unusual combination of studies has enabled him to take a broad-minded 
view of the theories of the alchemists, and to adopt a sympathetic 
attitude towards them.

CHAPTER I<lb/> 
THE MEANING OF ALCHEMY</head> 
 
<div2 type="section" n="1" id="d11"> 
<head>&sect; 1. The Aim of Alchemy.</head> 
 
<p>Alchemy is generally understood to have been that art whose end was 
the transmutation of the so-called base metals into gold by means of an 
ill-defined something called the Philosopher's Stone; but even from a 
purely physical standpoint, this is a somewhat superficial view. Alchemy 
was both a philosophy and an experimental science, and the transmutation 
of the metals was its end only in that this would give the final proof 
of the alchemistic hypotheses; in other words, Alchemy, considered from 
the physical standpoint, was the attempt to demonstrate experimentally 
on the material plane the validity of a certain philosophical view of 
the Cosmos. We see the genuine scientific spirit in the saying of one of 
the alchemists:  "Would to God . . . all men might become adepts in our 
Art&mdash;for then gold, the great idol of mankind, would lose its value, and 
we should prize it only 
 
<pb n="2"/>  
 
for its scientific teaching."<ref target="RedAlch1.1" n="6">1</ref> 
Unfortunately, however, not many alchemists came up to this ideal; and 
for the majority of them, Alchemy did mean merely the possibility of 
making gold cheaply and gaining untold wealth.</p> 
</div2> 
 
<div2 type="section" n="2" id="d12"> 
<head>&sect; 2. The Transcendental Theory of Alchemy.</head> 
 
<p>By some mystics, however, the opinion has been expressed that Alchemy 
was not a physical art or science at all, that in no sense was its 
object the manufacture of material gold, and that its processes were not 
carried of Alchemy out on the physical plane. According to this 
transcendental theory, Alchemy was concerned with man's soul, its object 
was the perfection, not of material substances, but of man in a 
spiritual sense.  Those who hold this view identify Alchemy with, or at 
least regard it as a branch of, Mysticism, from which it is supposed to 
differ merely by the employment of a special language; and they hold 
that the writings of the alchemists must not be understood literally as 
dealing with chemical operations, with furnaces, retorts, alembics, 
pelicans and the like, with salt, sulphur, mercury, gold and other 
material substances, but must be understood as grand allegories dealing 
with spiritual truths. According to this view, the figure of the 
transmutation of the "base" metals into gold symbolised the salvation of 
man&mdash;the transmutation of his soul into spiritual gold&mdash;which was to be 
obtained by the elimination of evil and the development of good by the 
grace of God; and the realisation of which salvation or spiritual 
transmutation 
 
<pb n="3"/>  
 
may be described as the New Birth, or that condition of being known as 
union with the Divine.  It would follow, of course, if this theory were 
true that the genuine alchemists were pure mystics, and hence, that the 
development of chemical science was not due to their labours, but to 
pseudo-alchemists who so far misunderstood their writings as to have 
interpreted them in a literal sense.</p> 
</div2> 
 
<div2 type="section" n="3" id="d13"> 
<head>&sect; 3. Failure of the Transcendental Theory.</head> 
 
<p>This theory, however, has been effectively disposed of by Mr. Arthur 
Edward Waite, who points to the lives of the alchemists themselves in 
refutation of it. For their lives indisputably prove that the alchemists 
were occupied with chemical operations on the physical plane, and that 
for whatever motive they toiled to discover a method for transmuting the 
commoner metals into actual, material gold. As Paracelsus himself says 
of the true "spagyric physicians," who were the alchemists of his 
period. "These do not give themselves up to ease and idleness . . .  But 
they devote themselves diligently to their labours; sweating whole 
nights over fiery furnaces. These do not kill the time with empty talk, 
but find their delight in their laboratory." 
<ref target="RedAlch1.2" n="7">2</ref> The writings of the alchemists contain 
(mixed, however, with much that from the physical standpoint appears 
merely fantastic) accurate accounts of many chemical processes and 
discoveries, which cannot be explained away by any method of 
transcendental interpretation. There is not the slightest doubt that 
chemistry owes its origin 
 
<pb n="4"/>  
 
to the direct labours of the alchemists themselves, and not to any who 
misread their writings.</p> 
</div2> 
 
<div2 type="section" n="4" id="d14"> 
<head>&sect; 4. The Qualifications of the Adept.</head>  
 
<p>At the same time, it is quite evident that there is a considerable 
element of Mysticism in the alchemistic doctrines; this has always been 
recognised; but, as a general rule, those who have approached the 
subject from the scientific point of view have considered this mystical 
element as of little or no importance.  However, there are certain 
curious facts which are not satisfactorily explained by a purely 
physical theory of Alchemy, and, in our opinion, the recognition of the 
importance of this mystical element and of the true relation which 
existed between Alchemy and Mysticism is essential for the right 
understanding of the subject. We may notice, in the first place, that 
the alchemists always speak of their Art as a Divine Gift, the highest 
secrets of which are not to be learnt from any books on the subject; and 
they invariably teach that the right mental attitude with regard to God 
is the first step necessary for the achievement of the <hi rend="italic">magnum 
opus</hi>. As says one alchemist: "In the first place, let every devout 
and God-fearing chemist and student of this Art consider that this 
arcanum should be regarded, not only as a truly great, but as a most 
holy Art (seeing that it typifies and shadows out the highest heavenly 
good).  Therefore, if any man desire to reach this great and unspeakable 
Mystery, he must remember that it is obtained not by the might of man, 
but by the grace of God, and that not our will or desire, but only the 
mercy of the Most High, can bestow it upon us. 
 
</p><p>For this reason you must first of all cleanse your 
 
<pb n="5"/>  
 
heart, lift it up to Him alone, and ask of Him this gift in true, 
earnest, and undoubting prayer. He alone can give and bestow  
it."<ref target="RedAlch1.3" n="8">3</ref> And "Basil Valentine":  "First, there 
should be the invocation of God, flowing from the depth of a pure and 
sincere heart, and a conscience which should be free from all ambition, 
hypocrisy, and vice, as also from all cognate faults, such as arrogance, 
boldness, pride, luxury, worldly vanity, oppression of the poor, and 
similar iniquities, which should all be rooted up out of the heart&mdash;that 
when a man appears before the Throne of Grace, to regain the health of 
his body, he may come with a conscience weeded of all tares, and be 
changed into a pure temple of God cleansed of all that  
defiles."<ref target="RedAlch1.4" n="9">4</ref></p> 
</div2> 
 
<div2 type="section" n="5" id="d15"> 
<head>&sect; 5. Alchemistic Language.</head> 
 
<p>In the second place, we must notice the nature of alchemistic 
language. As we have hinted above, and as is at once apparent on opening 
any alchemistic book, the language of Alchemy is very highly mystical, 
and there is much that is perfectly unintelligible in a physical sense. 
indeed, the alchemists habitually apologise for their vagueness on the 
plea that such mighty secrets may not be made more fully manifest.  It 
is true, of course, that in the days of Alchemy's degeneracy a good deal 
of pseudo-mystical nonsense was written by the many impostors then 
abounding, but the mystical style of language is by no means confined to 
the later alchemistic writings. It is also 
 
<pb n="6"/>  
 
true that the alchemists, no doubt, desired to shield their secrets from 
vulgar and profane eyes, and hence would necessarily adopt a symbolic 
language. But it is past belief that the language of the alchemist was 
due to some arbitrary plan; whatever it is to us, it was very real to 
him. Moreover, this argument cuts both ways, for those, also, who take a 
transcendental view of Alchemy regard its language as symbolical, 
although after a different manner. It is also, to say the least, 
curious, as Mr. A. E. Waite points out, that this mystical element 
should be found in the writings of the earlier alchemists, whose 
manuscripts were not written for publication, and therefore ran no risk 
of informing the vulgar of the precious secrets of Alchemy. On the other 
hand, the transcendental method of translation does often succeed in 
making sense out of what is otherwise unintelligible in the writings of 
the alchemists. The above-mentioned writer remarks on this point: 
"Without in any way pretending to assert that this hypothesis reduces 
the literary chaos of the philosophers into a regular order, it may be 
affirmed that it materially elucidates their writings, and that it is 
wonderful how contradictions, absurdities, and difficulties seem to 
dissolve wherever it is applied."<ref target="RedAlch1.5" n="10">5</ref> 
 
</p><p>The alchemists' love of symbolism is also conspicuously displayed 
in the curious designs with which certain of their books are 
embellished. We are not here referring to the illustrations of actual 
apparatus employed in carrying out the various operations of physical 
Alchemy, which are not infrequently found in the works of those 
alchemists who at the same time 
 
<pb n="7"/>  
 
were practical chemists (Glauber, for example), but to pictures whose 
meaning plainly lies not upon the surface and whose import is clearly 
symbolical, whether their symbolism has reference to physical or to 
spiritual processes. Examples of such symbolic illustrations, many of 
which are highly fantastic, will be found in plates 2, 3, and 4. We 
shall refer to them again in the course of the present and following 
chapters.</p> 
</div2> 
 
<div2 type="section" n="6" id="d16"> 
<head>&sect; 6. Alchemists of a Mystical Type.</head> 
 
<p>We must also notice that, although there cannot be the slightest 
doubt that the great majority of alchemists were engaged in problems and 
experiments of a physical nature, yet there were a few men included 
within the alchemistic ranks who were entirely, or almost entirely, 
concerned with problems of a spiritual nature; Thomas Vaughan, for 
example, and Jacob Boehme, who boldly employed the language of Alchemy 
in the elaboration of his system of mystical philosophy. And 
particularly must we notice, as Mr.  A. E. Waite has also indicated, the 
significant fact that the Western alchemists make unanimous appeal to 
Hermes Trismegistos as the greatest authority on the art of Alchemy, 
whose alleged writings are of an undoubtedly mystical character (see 
&sect; 29). It is clear, that in spite of its apparently physical 
nature, Alchemy must have been in some way closely connected with 
Mysticism.</p> 
</div2> 
 
<div2 type="section" n="7" id="d17"> 
<head>&sect; 7. The Meaning of Alchemy.</head> 
 
<p>If we are ever to understand the meaning of Alchemy aright we must 
look at the subject from the alchemistic point of view. In modern times 
there has come about a divorce between Religion and Science in men's 
minds (though more recently a unifying 
 
<pb n="8"/>  
 
tendency has set in); but it was otherwise with the alchemists, their 
religion and their science were closely united. We have said that 
"Alchemy was the attempt to demonstrate experimentally on the material 
plane the validity of a certain philosophical view of the Cosmos"; now, 
this "philosophical view of the Cosmos" was Mysticism. <hi rend="bold">Alchemy had 
its origin in the attempt to apply, in a certain manner, the principles 
of Mysticism to the things of the physical plane</hi>, and was, 
therefore, of a dual nature, on the one hand spiritual and religious, on 
the other, physical and material. As the anonymous author of <hi rend="italic">Lives of 
Alchemystical Philosophers</hi> (1815) remarks, "The universal chemistry, 
by which the science of alchemy opens the knowledge of all nature, being 
founded on <hi rend="italic">first principles</hi> forms analogy with whatever knowledge 
is founded on the <hi rend="italic">same first principles</hi>....  Saint John describes 
the redemption, or the new creation of the fallen soul, on the same 
first principles, until the consummation of the work, in which the 
Divine tincture transmutes the base metal of the soul into a perfection, 
that will pass the fire of eternity;"<ref target="RedAlch1.6" n="11">6</ref> 
that is to say, Alchemy and the mystical regeneration of man (in this 
writer's opinion) are analogous processes on different planes of being, 
because they are founded on the same first principles.</p> 
</div2> 
 
<div2 type="section" n="8" id="d18"> 
<head>&sect; 8. Opinions of other Writers.</head>  
 
<p>We shall here quote the opinions of two modern writers, as to the 
significance of Alchemy; one a mystic, the other a man of science. Says 
Mr.  A. E. Waite, "If the authors of the `Suggestive Inquiry' and of 
`Remarks on Alchemy and the 
 
<pb n="9"/>  
 
Alchemists' [two books putting forward the transcendental theory] had 
considered the lives of the symbolists, as well as the nature of the 
symbols, their views would have been very much modified; they would have 
found that the true method of Hermetic interpretation lies in a middle 
course; but the errors which originated with merely typographical 
investigations were intensified by a consideration of the great 
alchemical theorem, which, <hi rend="italic">par excellence</hi>, is one of universal 
development, which acknowledges that every substance contains 
undeveloped resources and potentialities, and can be brought outward and 
forward into perfection. They [the generality of alchemists] applied 
their theory only to the development of metallic substances from a lower 
to a higher order, but we see by their writings that the grand 
hierophants of Oriental and Western alchemy alike were continually 
haunted by brief and imperfect glimpses of glorious possibilities for 
man, if the evolution of his nature were accomplished along the lines of 
their theory."<ref target="RedAlch1.7" n="12">7</ref> Mr. M. M. Pattison

says: ". . . alchemy aimed at giving experimental proof of a certain 
theory of the whole system of nature, including humanity. The practical 
culmination of the alchemical quest presented a threefold aspect; the 
alchemists sought the stone of wisdom, for by gaining that they gained 
the control of wealth; they sought the universal panacea, for that would 
give them the power of enjoying wealth and life; they sought the soul of 
the world, for thereby they could hold communion with spiritual 
existences, and enjoy the fruition of spiritual life. The object of 
their search was to satisfy their material needs, their intellectual 
capacities, and their spiritual yearnings. The alchemists of the nobler 
sort always made the first of these objects subsidiary to the other 
two...."<ref target="RedAlch1.8" n="13">8</ref></p>

<head>&sect; 9. The Basic Idea of Alchemy.</head> 
 
<p>The famous axiom beloved by every alchemist&mdash;<hi rend="italic">"What is above is as 
that which is below, and what is below is as that which is 
above"</hi>&mdash;although of quesable{sic} origin, tersely expresses the 
basic idea of Alchemy. The alchemists postulated and believed in a very 
real sense in the essential unity of the Cosmos. Hence, they held that 
there is a correspondence or analogy existing between things spiritual 
and things physical, the same laws operating in each realm. As writes 
Sendivogius ". . . the Sages have been taught of God that this natural 
world is only an image and material copy of a heavenly and spiritual 
pattern; that the very existence of this world is based upon the reality 
of its celestial archetype; and that God has created it in imitation of 
the spiritual and invisible universe, in order that men 
 
<pb n="11"/>  
 
might be the better enabled to comprehend His heavenly teaching, and the 
wonders of His absolute and ineffable power and wisdom. Thus the Sage 
sees heaven reflected in Nature as in a mirror; and he pursues this Art, 
not for the sake of gold or silver, but for the love of the knowledge 
which it reveals; he jealously conceals it from the sinner and the 
scornful, lest the mysteries of heaven should be laid bare to the vulgar 
gaze."<ref target="RedAlch1.9" n="14">9</ref> 
 
</p><p>The alchemists held that the metals are one in essence, and 
spring from the same seed in the womb of nature, but are not all equally 
matured and perfect, gold being the highest product of Nature's powers. 
In gold, the alchemist saw a picture of the regenerate man, resplendent 
with spiritual beauty, overcoming all temptations and proof against 
evil; whilst he regarded lead&mdash;the basest of the metals&mdash;as typical of 
the sinful and unregenerate man, stamped with the hideousness of sin and 
easily overcome by temptation and evil; for whilst gold withstood the 
action of fire and all known corrosive liquids (save <hi rend="italic">aqua regia</hi> 
alone), lead was most easily acted upon. We are told that the 
Philosopher's Stone, which would bring about the desired grand 
transmutation, is of a species with gold itself and purer than the 
purest; understood in the mystical sense this means that the 
regeneration of man can be effected only by Goodness itself&mdash;in terms of 
Christian theology, by the Power of the Spirit of Christ. The 
Philosopher's Stone was regarded as symbolical of Christ Jesus, and in 
this sense we can understand the otherwise incredible powers attributed 
to it.</p>

<head>&sect; 10. The Law of Analogy.</head> 
 
<p>With the theories of physical Alchemy we shall deal at length in the 
following chapter, but enough has been said to indicate the analogy 
existing, according to the alchemistic view, between the problem of the 
perfection of the metals, <hi rend="italic">i.e</hi>., the transmutation of the "base" 
metals into gold, and the perfection or transfiguration of spiritual 
man; and it might also be added, between these problems and that of the 
perfection of man considered physiologically.  To the alchemistic 
philosopher these three problems were one: the same problem on different 
planes of being; and the solution was likewise one. He who held the key 
to one problem held the key to all three, provided he understood the 
analogy between matter and spirit. The point is not, be it noted, 
whether these problems are in reality one and the same; the main 
doctrine of analogy, which is, indeed, an essential element in all true 
mystical philosophy, will, we suppose, meet with general consent; but it 
will be contended (and rightly, we think) that the analogies drawn by 
the alchemists are fantastic and by no means always correct, though 
possibly there may be more truth in them than appears at first sight. 
The point is not that these analogies are correct, but that they were 
regarded as such by all true alchemists.  Says the author of <hi rend="italic">The 
Sophic Hydrolith</hi>: ". . . the practice of this Art enables us to 
understand, not merely the marvels of Nature, but the nature of God 
Himself, in all its unspeakable glory. It shadows forth, in a wonderful 
manner . . . all the articles of the Christian faith, and the reason why 
man must pass through much tribulation and anguish, and fall 
 
<pb n="13"/>  
 
a prey to death, before he can rise again to a new life." 
<ref target="RedAlch1.10" n="15">10</ref> A considerable portion of this curious 
alchemistic work is taken up in expounding the analogy believed to exist 
between the Philosopher's Stone and "the Stone which the builders 
rejected," Christ Jesus; and the writer concludes: "Thus . . .  I have 
briefly and simply set forth to you the perfect analogy which exists 
between our earthly and chemical and the true and heavenly Stone, Jesus 
Christ, whereby we may attain unto certain beatitude and perfection, not 
only in earthly but also in eternal life."<ref target="RedAlch1.11" n="16">11</ref>  
And likewise says Peter Bonus: "I am firmly persuaded that any 
unbeliever who got truly to know this Art, would straightway confess the 
truth of our Blessed Religion, and believe in the Trinity and in our 
Lord Jesus Christ."<ref target="RedAlch1.12" n="17">12</ref></p>

<div2 type="section" n="11" id="d21"> 
<head>&sect; 11. The Dual Nature of Alchemy.</head> 
 
<p>For the most part, the alchemists were chiefly engaged with the 
carrying out of the alchemistic theory on the physical plane, 
<hi rend="italic">i.e</hi>., with the attempt to transmute the "base" metals into the 
"noble" ones; some for the love of knowledge, but alas! the vast 
majority for the love of mere wealth. But all who were worthy of the 
title of "alchemist" realised at times, more or less dimly, the 
possibility of the application of the same methods to man and the 
glorious result of the transmutation of man's soul into spiritual gold. 
There were a few who had a 
 
<pb n="14"/>  
 
clearer vision of this ideal, those who devoted their activities 
entirely, or almost so, to the attainment of this highest goal of 
alchemistic philosophy, and concerned themselves little if at all with 
the analogous problem on the physical plane. The theory that Alchemy 
originated in the attempt to demonstrate the applicability of the 
principles of Mysticism to the things of the physical realm brings into 
harmony the physical and transcendental theories of Alchemy and the 
various conflicting facts advanced in favour of each.  It explains the 
existence of the above-mentioned, two very different types of 
alchemists. It explains the appeal to the works attributed to Hermes, 
and the presence in the writings of the alchemists of much that is 
clearly mystical. And finally, it is in agreement with such statements 
as we have quoted above from <hi rend="italic">The Sophic Hydrolith</hi> and elsewhere,

<p>In accordance with our primary object as stated in the preface, we 
shall confine our attention mainly to the physical aspect of Alchemy; 
but in order to understand its theories, it appears to us to be 
essential to realise the fact that Alchemy was an attempted application 
of the principles of Mysticism to the things of the physical world. The 
supposed analogy between man and the metals sheds light on what 
otherwise would be very difficult to understand. It helps to make plain 
why the alchemists attributed moral qualities to the metals&mdash;some are 
called "imperfect," "base"; others are said to be "perfect," "noble." 
And especially does it help to explain the alchemistic

notions regarding the nature of the metals. The alchemists believed that 
the metals were constructed after the manner of man, into whose 
constitution three factors were regarded as entering: body, soul, and 
spirit. As regards man, mystical philosophers generally use these terms 
as follows: "body" is the outward manifestation and form; "soul" is the 
inward individual spirit<ref target="RedAlch1.13" n="18">13</ref>; and 
"spirit" is the universal Soul in all men. And likewise, according to 
the alchemists, in the metals, there is the "body" or outward form and 
properties, "metalline soul" or spirit,<ref target="RedAlch1.14" n="19">14</ref>  
and finally, the all-pervading essence of all metals.  As writes the 
author of the exceedingly curious tract entitled <hi rend="italic">The Book of 
Lambspring</hi>. "Be warned and understand truly that two fishes are 
swimming in our sea," illustrating his remark by the symbolical picture 
reproduced in plate 2, and adding in elucidation thereof, "The Sea is 
the Body, the two Fishes are Soul and Spirit."   
<ref target="RedAlch1.15" n="20">15</ref> The alchemists, however, were not always 
consistent in their use of the term "spirit." Sometimes (indeed 
frequently) they employed it to denote merely the more volatile portions 
of a chemical substance; at other times it had a more interior 
significance.</p>

<head>&sect; 13. Alchemy, Mysticism and Modern Science.</head> 
 
<p>We notice the great difference between the

alchemistic theory and the views regarding the constitution of matter 
which have dominated Chemistry since the time of Dalton. But at the 
present time Dalton's theory of the chemical elements is undergoing a 
profound modification. We do not imply that Modern Science is going back 
to any such fantastic ideas as were held by the alchemists, but we are 
struck with the remarkable similarity between this alchemistic theory of 
a soul of all metals, a one primal element, and modern views regarding 
the ether of space. In its attempt to demonstrate the applicability of 
the fundamental principles of Mysticism to the things of the physical 
realm Alchemy apparently failed and ended its days in fraud. It appears, 
however, that this true aim of alchemistic art&mdash;particularly the 
demonstration of the validity of the theory that all the various forms 
of matter are produced by an evolutionary process from some one primal 
element or <hi rend="italic">quintessence</hi>&mdash;is being realised by recent researches 
in the domain of physical and chemical science.</p>

THE THEORY OF PHYSICAL ALCHEMY</head> 
 
<div2 type="section" n="14" id="d25"> 
<head>&sect; 14. Supposed Proofs of Transmutation.</head> 
  
<p>It must be borne in mind when reviewing the theories of the 
alchemists, that there were a number of phenomena known at the time, the 
superficial examination of which would naturally engender a belief that 
the transmutation of the metals was a common occurrence. For example, 
the deposition of copper on iron when immersed in a solution of a copper 
salt (<hi rend="italic">e.g</hi>., blue vitriol) was naturally concluded to be a 
transmutation of iron into copper,<ref target="RedAlch2.1" n="21">1</ref> 
although, had the alchemists examined the residual liquid, they would 
have found that the two metals had merely exchanged places; and the fact 
that white and yellow alloys of copper with arsenic and other substances 
could be produced, pointed to the possibility of transmuting copper into 
silver and gold. It was also known that if water (and this is true of 
distilled water which does not contain solid matter in solution) was 
boiled for some time in a glass flask, some solid, earthy matter was 
produced; and if water could be transmuted into earth, surely one metal 
could be 
 
<pb n="18"/>  
 
converted into another.<ref target="RedAlch2.2" n="22">2</ref> On account of 
these and like phenomena the alchemists regarded the transmutation of 
the metals as an experimentally proved fact. Even if they are to be 
blamed for their superficial observation of such phenomena, yet, 
nevertheless, their labours marked a distinct advance upon the purely 
speculative and theoretical methods of the philosophers preceding them. 
Whatever their faults, the alchemists <hi rend="italic">were</hi> the forerunners of 
modern experimental science.</p> 
</div2> 
 
<div2 type="section" n="15" id="d26"> 
<head>&sect; 15. The Alchemistic Elements.</head> 
 
<p>The alchemists regarded the metals as composite, and granting this, 
then the possibility of transmutation is only a logical conclusion. In 
order to understand the theory of the elements held by them we must rid 
ourselves of any idea that it bears any close resemblance to Dalton's 
theory of the chemical elements; this is clear from what has been said 
in the preceding chapter. Now, it is a fact of simple observation that 
many otherwise different bodies manifest some property in common, as, 
for instance, combustibility. Properties such as these were regarded as 
being due to some principle or element common to all bodies exhibiting 
such properties; thus, combustibility was thought to be due to some 
elementary principle of combustion&mdash;the "sulphur" of the alchemists and 
the "phlogiston" of a later period. This is a view which <hi rend="italic">&agrave; 
priori</hi> appears to be not unlikely; but it is now known that, 
although there are relations existing between the properties of bodies 
 
<pb n="19"/>  
 
and their constituent chemical elements (and also, it should be noted, 
the relative arrangement of the particles of these elements), it is the 
less obvious properties which enable chemists to determine the 
constitution of bodies, and the connection is very far from being of the 
simple nature imagined by the alchemists.</p> 
</div2> 
 
<div2 type="section" n="16" id="d27"> 
<head>&sect; 16. Aristotle's Views regarding the Elements.</head> 
 
<p>For the origin of the alchemistic theory of the elements it is 
necessary to go back to the philosophers preceding the alchemists, and 
it is not improbable that they derived it from some still older source. 
It was taught by Empedocles of Agrigent (440 B.C.  <hi rend="italic">circa</hi>), who 
considered that there were four elements&mdash;earth, water, air, and fire. 
Aristotle added a fifth, "the ether." These elements were regarded, not 
as different kinds of matter, but rather as different forms of the one 
original matter, whereby it manifested different properties. It was 
thought that to these elements were due the four primary properties of 
dryness, moistness, warmth, and coldness, each element being supposed to 
give rise to two of these properties, dryness and warmth being thought 
to be due to fire, moistness and warmth to air, moistness and coldness 
to water, and dryness and coldness to earth. Thus, moist and cold bodies 
(liquids in general) were said to possess these properties in 
consequence of the aqueous element, and were termed "waters," &amp;c. Also, 
since these elements were not regarded as different kinds of matter, 
transmutation was thought to be possible, one being convertible into 
another, as in the example given above (&sect; 14)</p> 
<pb n="20"/>  
</div2> 
 
<div2 type="section" n="17" id="d28"> 
<head>&sect; 17. The Sulphur-Mercury Theory.</head>  
 
<p>Coming to the alchemists, we find the view that the metals are all 
composed of two elementary principles&mdash;sulphur and mercury&mdash;in different 
proportions and degrees of purity, well-nigh universally accepted in the 
earlier days of Alchemy. By these terms "sulphur" and "mercury," 
however, must not be understood the common bodies ordinarily designated 
by these names; like the elements of Aristotle, the alchemistic 
principles were regarded as properties rather than as substances, though 
it must be confessed that the alchemists were by no means always clear 
on this point themselves. Indeed, it is not altogether easy to say 
exactly what the alchemists did mean by these terms, and the question is 
complicated by the fact that very frequently they make mention of 
different sorts of "sulphur" and "mercury."  Probably, however, we shall 
not be far wrong in saying that "sulphur" was generally regarded as the 
principle of combustion and also of colour, and was said to be present 
on account of the fact that most metals are changed into earthy 
substances by the aid of fire; and to the "mercury," the metallic 
principle <hi rend="italic">par excellence</hi>, was attributed such properties as 
fusibility, malleability and lustre, which were regarded as 
characteristic of the metals in general. The pseudo-Geber (see &sect; 
32) says that "Sulphur is a fatness of the Earth, by temperate Decoction 
in the Mine of the Earth thickened, until it be hardned{sic} and made 
dry."<ref target="RedAlch2.3" n="23">3</ref> He considered an excess of 
sulphur to be a cause of imperfection in the metals, and he writes 
 
<pb n="21"/>  
 
that one of the causes of the corruption of the metals by fire "is the 
Inclusion of a burning Sulphuriety in the profundity of their Substance, 
diminishing them by Inflamation, and exterminating also into Fume, with 
extream Consumption, whatsoever Argentvive in them is of good 
Fixation."<ref target="RedAlch2.4" n="24">4</ref> He assumed, further, that 
the metals contained an incombustible as well as a combustible sulphur, 
the latter sulphur being apparently regarded as an impurity. 
<ref target="RedAlch2.5" n="25">5</ref> A later alchemist says that sulphur is 
"most easily recognised by the vital spirit in animals, the colour in 
metals, the odour in plants."<ref target="RedAlch2.6" n="26">6</ref> Mercury, 
on the other hand, according to the pseudo-Geber, is the cause of 
perfection in the metals, and endows gold with its lustre. Another 
alchemist, quoting Arnold de Villanova, writes: "Quicksilver is the 
elementary form of all things fusible; for all things fusible, when 
melted, are changed into it, and it mingles with them because it is of 
the same substance with them. Such bodies differ from quicksilver in 
their composition only so far as itself is or is not free from the 
foreign matter of impure sulphur."<ref target="RedAlch2.7" n="27">7</ref> The 
obtaining of "philosophical mercury," the imaginary virtues of which the 
alchemists never tired of relating, was generally held to be essential 
for the attainment of the <hi rend="italic">magnum opus</hi>. It was commonly thought 
that it could be prepared from ordinary quicksilver by 
 
<pb n="22"/>  
 
purificatory processes, whereby the impure sulphur supposed to be 
present in this sort of mercury might be purged away. 
 
</p><p>The sulphur-mercury theory of the metals was held by such famous 
alchemists as Roger Bacon, Arnold de Villanova and Raymond Lully. Until 
recently it was thought to have originated to a great extent with the 
Arabian alchemist, Geber; but the late Professor Berthelot showed that 
the works ascribed to Geber, in which the theory is put forward, are 
forgeries of a date by which it was already centuries old (see &sect; 
32).  Occasionally, arsenic was regarded as an elementary principle 
(this view is to be found, for example, in the work <hi rend="italic">Of the Sum of 
Perfection</hi>, by the pseudo-Geber), but the idea was not general.</p> 
</div2> 
 
<div2 type="section" n="18" id="d29"> 
<head>&sect; 18. The Sulphur-Mercury-Salt Theory.</head> 
 
<p>Later in the history of Alchemy, the mercury-sulphur theory was 
extended by the addition of a third elementary principle, salt. As in 
the case of philosophical sulphur and mercury, by this term was not 
meant common salt (sodium chloride) or any of those substances commonly 
known as salts. "Salt" was the name given to a supposed basic principle 
in the metals, a principle of fixity and solidification, conferring the 
property of resistance to fire. In this extended form, the theory is 
found in the works of Isaac of Holland and in those attributed to "Basil 
Valentine," who (see the work <hi rend="italic">Of Natural and Supernatural Things</hi>) 
attempts to explain the differences in the properties of the metals as 
the result of the differences in the proportion of sulphur, salt, and 
mercury they contain. Thus, copper, which is highly coloured, is said to 
contain much sulphur, whilst iron 
 
<pb n="23"/>  
 
is supposed to contain an excess of salt, &amp;c. The sulphur-mercury-salt 
theory was vigorously championed by Paracelsus, and the doctrine gained 
very general acceptance amongst the alchemists. Salt, however, seems 
generally to have been considered a less important principle than either 
mercury or sulphur. 
 
</p><p>The same germ-idea underlying these doctrines is to be found much 
later in Stahl's phlogistic theory (eighteenth century), which attempted 
to account for the combustibility of bodies by the assumption that such 
bodies all contain "phlogiston"&mdash;the hypothetical principle of 
combustion (see &sect; 72)&mdash;though the concept of "phlogiston" 
approaches more nearly to the modern idea of an element than do the 
alchemistic elements or principles. It was not until still later in the 
history of Chemistry that it became quite evident that the more obvious 
properties of chemical substances are not specially conferred on them in 
virtue of certain elements entering into their constitution.</p> 
</div2> 
 
<div2 type="section" n="19" id="d30"> 
<head>&sect; 19. Alchemistic Elements and Principles.</head> 
 
<p>The alchemists combined the above theories with Aristotle's theory of 
the elements. The latter, namely, earth, air, fire and water, were 
regarded as more interior, more primary, than the principles, whose 
source was said to be these same elements. As writes Sendivogius in Part 
II. of <hi rend="italic">The New Chemical Light</hi>: "The three Principles of things 
are produced out of the four elements in the following manner:  Nature, 
whose power is in her obedience to the Will of God, ordained from the 
very beginning, that the four elements should incessantly act on one

so, in obedience to her behest, fire began to act on air, and produced 
Sulphur; air acted on water, and produced Mercury; water, by its action 
on the earth, produced Salt. Earth, alone, having nothing to act upon, 
did not produce anything, but became the nurse, or womb, of these three 
Principles. We designedly speak of three Principles; for though the

<head>&sect; 20. The Growth of the Metals.</head> 
 
<p>The alchemists regarded the metals as growing in the womb of the 
earth, and a knowledge of this growth as being of very great importance. 
Thomas Norton (who, however, contrary to the generality of alchemists, 
denied that metals have seed and that they grow in the sense of 
multiply) says:&mdash;</p> 
 
<lg type="verse"> 
<l><hi rend="italic">"Mettals</hi> of kinde grow lowe under ground,</l> 
<l>For above erth rust in them is found;</l> 
<l>Soe above erth appeareth corruption,</l> 
<l>Of mettalls, and in long tyme destruction,</l> 
<l>Whereof noe Cause is found in this Case,</l>

<l>But Stones and Mineralls under Erth repaier." 
<ref target="RedAlch2.10" n="30">10</ref></l> 
</lg> 
 
 
<p>Norton here expresses the opinion, current among the alchemists, that 
each and every thing has its own peculiar environment natural to it; a 
view controverted by Robert Boyle (&sect; 71). So firm was the belief in 
the growth of metals, that mines were frequently closed for a while in 
order that the supply of metal might be renewed. The fertility of Mother 
Earth forms the subject of one of the illustrations in <hi rend="italic">The Twelve 
Keys</hi> of "Basil Valentine" (see &sect; 41), We reproduce it in plate 
3, fig. A. Regarding this subject, the author writes: "The quickening 
power of the earth produces all things that grow forth from it, and he 
who says that the earth has no life makes 
 
<pb n="26"/>  
 
a statement which is flatly contradicted by the most ordinary facts. For 
what is dead cannot produce life and growth, seeing that it is devoid of 
the quickening spirit. This spirit is the life and soul that dwell in 
the earth, and are nourished by heavenly and sidereal influences. For 
all herbs, trees, and roots, and all metals and minerals, receive their 
growth and nutriment from the spirit of the earth, which is the spirit 
of life. This spirit is itself fed by the stars, and is thereby rendered 
capable of imparting nutriment to all things that grow, and of nursing 
them as a mother does her child while it is yet in the womb.  The 
minerals are hidden in the womb of the earth, and nourished by her with 
the spirit which she receives from above. 
 
</p><p>"Thus the power of growth that I speak of is imparted not by the 
earth, but by the life-giving spirit that is in it. If the earth were 
deserted by this spirit, it would be dead, and no longer able to afford 
nourishment to anything. For its sulphur or richness would lack the 
quickening spirit without which there can be neither life nor 
growth."<ref target="RedAlch2.11" n="31">11</ref></p>

Moreover, it was thought by some alchemists that a due observance of 
astrological conditions was necessary for successfully carrying out 
important alchemistic experiments.</p> 
</div2> 
 
<div2 type="section" n="22" id="d33"> 
<head>&sect; 22. Alchemistic View of the Nature of Gold.</head> 
 
<p>The alchemists regarded gold as the most perfect metal, silver being 
considered more perfect than the rest. The reason of this view is not 
difficult to understand: gold is the most beautiful of all the metals, 
and it retains its beauty without tarnishing; it resists the action of 
fire and most corrosive liquids, and is unaffected by sulphur; it was 
regarded, as we have pointed out above (see &sect; 9), as symbolical of 
the regenerate man. Silver, on the other hand, is, indeed, a beautiful 
metal which wears well in a pure atmosphere and resists the action of 
fire; but it is attacked by certain corrosives (e.g., <hi rend="italic">aqua fortis</hi> 
or nitric acid) and also by sulphur. Through all the metals, from the 
one seed, Nature, according to the 
 
<pb n="28"/>  
 
alchemists, works continuously up to gold; so that, in a sense, all 
other metals are gold in the making; their existence marks the staying 
of Nature's powers; as "Eiren&aelig;us Philalethes" says: "All metallic 
seed is the seed of gold; for gold is the intention of Nature in regard 
to all metals. If the base metals are not gold, it is only through some 
accidental hindrance; they are all potentially gold." 
<ref target="RedAlch2.13" n="33">13</ref> Or, as another alchemist puts it: "Since 
. . . the substance of the metals is <hi rend="italic">one</hi>, and common to all, and 
since this substance is (either at once, or after laying aside in course 
of time the foreign and evil sulphur of the baser metals by a process of 
gradual digestion) changed by the virtue of its own indwelling sulphur 
into GOLD, which is the goal of all the metals, and the true intention 
of Nature&mdash;we are obliged to admit, and freely confess that in the 
mineral kingdom, as well as in the vegetable and animal kingdoms, Nature 
seeks and demands a gradual attainment of perfection, and a gradual 
approximation to the highest standard of purity and excellence." 
<ref target="RedAlch2.14" n="34">14</ref> Such was the alchemistic view of the 
generation of the metals; a theory which is admittedly crude, but which, 
nevertheless, contains the germ of a great principle of the utmost 
importance, namely, the idea that all the varying forms of matter are 
evolved from some one primordial stuff&mdash;a principle of which chemical 
science lost sight for awhile, for its validity was unrecognised by 
Dalton's Atomic Theory (at least, as enunciated by him), 
 
<pb n="29"/>  
 
but which is being demonstrated, as we hope to show hereinafter, by 
recent scientific research. The alchemist was certainly a fantastic 
evolutionist, but he <hi rend="italic">was</hi> an evolutionist, and, moreover, he did 
not make the curious and paradoxical mistake of regarding the fact of 
evolution as explaining away the existence of God&mdash;the alchemist 
recognised the hand of the Divine in nature&mdash;and, although, in these 
days of modern science, we cannot accept his theory of the growth of 
metals, we can, nevertheless, appreciate and accept the fundamental 
germ-idea underlying it.</p> 
</div2> 
 
<div2 type="section" n="23" id="d34"> 
<head>&sect; 23. The Philosopher's Stone.</head> 
 
<p>The alchemist strove to assist Nature in her gold-making, or, at 
least, to carry out her methods.  pseudo-Geber taught that the imperfect 
metals were to be perfected or cured by the application of "medicines." 
Three forms of medicines were distinguished; the first bring about 
merely a temporary change, and the changes wrought by the second class, 
although permanent, are not complete. "A Medicine of the third Order," 
he writes, "I call every Preparation, which, when it comes to Bodies, 
with its projection, takes away all Corruption, and perfects them with 
the Difference of all Compleatment. But this is one only." 
<ref target="RedAlch2.15" n="35">15</ref> This, the true medicine that would 
produce a real and permanent transmutation is the <hi rend="bold">Philosopher's 
Stone</hi>, the Masterpiece of alchemistic art. Similar views were held 
by all the alchemists, though some of them taught that it was necessary 
first of all to reduce the metals to their first 
 
<pb n="30"/>  
 
substance. Often, two forms of the Philosopher's Stone were 
distinguished, or perhaps we should say, two degrees of perfection in 
the one Stone; that for transmuting the "imperfect" metals into silver 
being said to be white, the stone or "powder of projection" for gold 
being said to be of a red colour. In other accounts (see Chapter V.) the 
medicine is described as of a pale brimstone hue. 
 
</p><p>Most of the alchemists who claimed knowledge of the Philosopher's 
Stone or the <hi rend="italic">materia prima</hi> necessary for its preparation, 
generally kept its nature most secret, and spoke only in the most 
enigmatical and allegorical language, the majority of their recipes 
containing words of unknown meaning. In some cases gold or silver, as 
the case may be, was employed in preparing the "medicine"; and, after 
projection had been made, this was, of course, obtained again in the 
metallic form, the alchemist imagining that a transmutation had been 
effected. In the case of the few other recipes that are intelligible, 
the most that could be obtained by following out their instructions is a 
white or yellow metallic alloy superficially resembling silver or 
gold.</p> 
</div2> 
 
<div2 type="section" n="24" id="d35"> 
<head>&sect; 24. The Nature of the Philosopher's Stone.</head> 
 
<p>The mystical as distinguished from the pseudo-practical descriptions 
of the Stone and its preparation are by far the more interesting of the 
two. Paracelsus, in his work on <hi rend="italic">The Tincture of the Philosophers</hi>, 
tells us that all that is necessary for us to do is to mix and coagulate 
the "rose-coloured blood from the Lion" and "the gluten from the Eagle," 
by which he probably meant that we must combine "philosophical sulphur" 
with "philosophical mercury." 
 
<pb n="31"/>  
 
This opinion, that the Philosopher's Stone consists of "philosophical 
sulphur and mercury" combined so as to constitute a perfect unity, was 
commonly held by the alchemists, and they frequently likened this union 
to the conjunction of the sexes in marriage. "Eiren&aelig;us 
Philalethes" tells us that for the preparation of the Stone it is 
necessary to extract the seed of gold, though this cannot be 
accomplished by subjecting gold to corrosive liquids, but only by a 
homogeneous water (or liquid)&mdash;the Mercury of the Sages. In the <hi rend="italic">Book 
of the Revelation of Hermes, interpreted by Theophrastus Paracelsus, 
concerning the Supreme Secret of the World</hi>, the Medicine, which is 
here, as not infrequently, identified with the alchemistic essence of 
all things or Soul of the World, is described in the following 
suggestive language: "This is the Spirit of Truth, which the world 
cannot comprehend without the interposition of the Holy Ghost, or 
without the instruction of those who know it. The same is of a 
mysterious nature, wondrous strength, boundless power.... By Avicenna 
this Spirit is named the Soul of the World. For, as the Soul moves all 
the limbs of the Body, so also does this Spirit move all bodies. And as 
the Soul is in all the limbs of the Body, so also is this Spirit in all 
elementary created things. It is sought by many and found by few. It is 
beheld from afar and found near; for it exists in every thing, in every 
place, and at all times. It has the powers of all creatures; its action 
is found in all elements, and the qualities of all things are therein, 
even in the highest perfection . . . it heals all dead and living bodies 
without other medicine, . . . converts all metallic 
 
<pb n="32"/>  
 
bodies into gold, and there is nothing like unto it under Heaven."

<div2 type="section" n="25" id="d36"> 
<head>&sect; 25. The Theory of Development.</head> 
 
<p>From the ascetic standpoint (and unfortunately, most mystics have 
been somewhat overfond of ascetic ideas), the development of the soul is 
only fully possible with the mortification of the body; and all true 
Mysticism teaches that if we would reach the highest goal possible for 
man&mdash;union with the Divine&mdash;there must be a giving up of our own 
individual wills, an abasement of the soul before the Spirit. And so the 
alchemists taught that for the achievement of the <hi rend="italic">magnum opus</hi> on 
the physical plane, we must strip the metals of their outward properties 
in order to develop the essence within. As says Helvetius: " . . the 
essences of metals are hidden in their outward bodies, as the kernel is 
hidden in the nut. Every earthly body, whether animal, vegetable, or 
mineral, is the habitation and terrestrial abode of that celestial 
spirit, or influence, which is its principle of life or growth. The 
secret of Alchemy is the destruction of the body, which enables the 
Artist to get at, and utilise for his own purposes, the living 
soul."<ref target="RedAlch2.17" n="37">17</ref> This killing of the outward 
nature of material things was to be brought about by the processes of 
putrefaction and decay; hence the reason why such processes figure so 
largely in alchemistic recipes for the preparation of the "Divine 
Magistery."

It must be borne in mind, however, that the alchemists used the terms 
"putrefaction" and "decay" rather indiscriminately, applying them to 
chemical processes which are no longer regarded as such. Pictorial 
symbols of death and decay representative of such processes are to be 
found in several alchemistic books.  There is a curious series of 
pictures in <hi rend="italic">A Form and Method of Perfecting Base Metals</hi>, by Janus 
Lacinus, the Calabrian (a short tract prefixed to <hi rend="italic">The New Pearl of 
Great Price</hi> by Peter Bonus&mdash;see &sect; 39), of which we show three 
examples in plates 3 and 4. In the first picture of the series (not 
shown here) we enter the palace of the king (gold) and observe him 
sitting crowned upon his throne, surrounded by his son (mercury) and 
five servants (silver, copper, tin, iron and lead). In the next picture 
(plate 3, fig. B), the son, incited by the servants, kills his father; 
and, in the third, he catches the blood of his murdered parent in his 
robes; whereby we understand that an amalgam of gold and mercury is to 
be prepared, the gold apparently disappearing or dying, whilst the 
mercury is coloured thereby. The next picture shows us a grave being 
dug, <hi rend="italic">i.e</hi>., a furnace is to be made ready. In the fifth picture in 
the series, the son "thought to throw his father into the grave, and to 
leave him there; but . . . both fell in together"; and in the sixth, 
picture (plate 4, fig. A), we see the son being prevented from escaping, 
both son and father being left in the grave to decay. Here we have 
instructions in symbolical form to place the amalgam in a sealed vessel 
in the furnace and to allow it to remain there until some change is 
observed. So the allegory 
 
<pb n="34"/>  
 
proceeds. Ultimately the father is restored to life, the symbol of 
resurrection being (as might be expected) of frequent occurrence in 
alchemistic literature.  By this resurrection we understand that the 
gold will finally be obtained in a pure form. Indeed, it is now the 
"great medicine" and, in the last picture of the series (plate 4, fig. 
B), the king's son and his five servants are all made kings in virtue of 
its powers.</p>

<p>The alchemists believed that a most minute proportion of the Stone 
projected upon considerable quantities of heated mercury, molten lead, 
or other "base" metal, would transmute practically the whole into silver 
or gold. This claim of the alchemists, that a most minute quantity of 
the Stone was sufficient to transmute considerable quantities of "base" 
metal, has been the object of much ridicule.  Certainly, some of the 
claims of the alchemists (understood literally) are out of all reason; 
but on the other hand, the disproportion between the quantities of Stone 
and transmuted metal cannot be advanced as an <hi rend="italic">&agrave; priori</hi> 
objection to the alchemists' claims, inasmuch that a class of chemical 
reactions (called "catalytic") is known, in which the presence of a 
small quantity of some appropriate form of matter&mdash;the catalyst&mdash;brings 
about a chemical change in an indefinite quantity of some other form or 
forms; thus, for example, cane-sugar in aqueous solution is converted 
into two other sugars by the action of small quantities of acid; and 
sulphur-dioxide and oxygen, which will not combine under ordinary 
conditions, do so readily in the presence of a small quantity 
 
<pb n="35"/>  
 
of platinized asbestos, which is obtained unaltered after the reaction 
is completed and may be used over and over again (this process is 
actually employed in the manufacture of sulphuric acid or oil of 
vitriol).  However, whether any such catalytic transmutation of the 
chemical "elements" is possible is merely conjecture.</p>

<head>&sect; 27. The Elixir of Life.</head> 
 
<p>The Elixir of Life, which was generally described as a solution of 
the Stone in spirits of wine, or identified with the Stone itself, could 
be applied, so it was thought, under certain conditions to the alchemist 
himself, with an entirely analogous result, <hi rend="italic">i.e</hi>., it would 
restore him to the flower of youth. The idea, not infrequently 
attributed to the alchemists, that the Elixir would endow one with a 
life of endless duration on the material plane is not in strict accord 
with alchemistic analogy. From this point of view, the effect of the 
Elixir is physiological perfection, which, although ensuring long life, 
is not equivalent to endless life on the material plane. "The 
Philosophers' Stone," says Paracelsus, "purges the whole body of man, 
and cleanses it from all impurities by the introduction of new and more 
youthful forces which it joins to the nature of man." 
<ref target="RedAlch2.18" n="38">18</ref> And in another work expressive of the 
opinions of the same alchemist, we read: ". . .  there is nothing which 
might deliver the mortal body from death; but there is One Thing which 
may postpone decay, renew youth, and prolong short human

life . . . "<ref target="RedAlch2.19" n="39">19</ref> In the theory that a

<head>&sect; 28. The Practical Methods of the Alchemists.</head> 
 
<p>We will conclude this chapter with some few remarks regarding the 
practical methods of the alchemists. In their experiments, the 
alchemists worked with very large quantities of material compared with 
what is employed in chemical researches at the present day. They had 
great belief in the efficacy of time to effect a desired change in their 
substances, and they were wont to repeat the same operation (such as 
distillation, for example) on the same material over and over again; 
which demonstrated their unwearied patience, even if it effected little 
towards the attainment of their end. They paid much attention to any 
changes of colour they observed in their experiments, and many 
descriptions of supposed methods to achieve the <hi rend="italic">magnum opus</hi> 
contain detailed directions as to the various changes of colour which 
must be obtained in the material operated upon if a successful issue to 
the experiment is desired.<ref target="RedAlch2.20" n="40">20</ref>

In plates 5 and 6 we give illustrations of some characteristic pieces of 
apparatus employed by the alchemists. Plate 5, fig. A, and plate 6, fig. 
A, are from a work known as <hi rend="italic">Alchemiae Gebri</hi> (1545); plate 5, fig. 
B, is from Glauber's work on Furnaces (1651); and plate 6, fig. B, is 
from a work by Dr. John French entitled <hi rend="italic">The Art of Distillation</hi> 
(1651). 
 
<pb n="38"/>  
 
The first figure shows us a furnace and alembics.  The alembic proper is 
a sort of still-head which can be luted on to a flask or other vessel, 
and was much used for distillations. In the present case, however, the 
alembics are employed in conjunction with apparatus for subliming 
difficultly volatile substances.  Plate 5, fig. B, shows another 
apparatus for sublimation, consisting of a sort of oven, and three 
detachable upper chambers, generally called aludels. In both forms of 
apparatus the vapours are cooled in the upper part of the vessel, and 
the substance is deposited in the solid form, being thereby purified 
from less volatile impurities. Plate 6, fig. A, shows an athanor (or 
digesting furnace) and a couple of digesting vessels. A vessel of this 
sort was employed for heating bodies in a closed space, the top being 
sealed up when the substances to be operated upon had been put inside, 
and the vessel heated in ashes in an athanor, a uniform temperature 
being maintained.  The pelican, illustrated in plate 6, fig. B, was used 
for a similar purpose, the two arms being added in the idea that the 
vapours would be circulated thereby.</p>

Colours, successively and orderly affecting the matter and its 
affections and demonstrative passions, whereof there are also three 
special ones (as critical) to be noted; to these some add a Fourth. The 
first is black, which is called the Crow's head, because of its extreme 
blackness, whose crepusculum sheweth the beginning of the action of the 
fire of nature and solution, and the blackest midnight sheweth the 
perfection of liquefaction, and confusion of the elements. Then the 
grain putrefies and is corrupted, that it may be the more apt for 
generation.  The white colour succeedeth the black, wherein is given the 
perfection of the first degree, and of the White Sulphur. This is called 
the blessed stone; this Earth is white and foliated, wherein 
Philosophers do sow their gold. The third is Orange colour, which is 
produced in the passage of the white to the red, as the middle, and 
being mixed of both is as the dawn with his saffron hair, a forerunner 
of the Sun. The fourth colour is Ruddy and Sanguine, which is extracted 
from the white fire only. Now because whiteness is easily altered by any 
other colour before day it quickly faileth of its candour. But the deep 
redness of the Sun perfecteth the work of Sulphur, which is called the 
Sperm of the male, the fire of the Stone, the King's Crown, and the Son 
of Sol, wherein the first labour of the workman resteth.

"Besides these decretory signs which firmly inhere in the matter, and 
shew its essential mutations, almost infinite colours appear, and shew 
themselves in vapours, as the Rainbow in the clouds, which quickly pass 
away and are expelled by those that succeed, more affecting the air than 
the earth: the operator must have a gentle care of them, because they 
are not permanent, and proceed not from the intrinsic disposition of the 
matter, but from the fire painting and fashioning everything after its 
pleasure, or casually by heat in slight moisture" (see <hi rend="italic">Collectanea 
Hermetica</hi>, edited by W. Wynn Westcott, vol. i., 1893, pp. 28 and 
29). Very probably this is not without a mystical meaning as well as a 
supposed application in the preparation of the physical Stone.</p></note>

<p>Having now considered the chief points in the theory of Physical 
Alchemy, we must turn our attention to the lives and individual 
teachings of the alchemists themselves.  The first name which is found 
in the history of Alchemy is that of <hi rend="bold">Hermes 
Trismegistos</hi>.  We have 
already mentioned the high esteem in which the works ascribed to this 
personage 
 
<pb n="40"/>  
 
were held by the alchemists (&sect; 6). He has been regarded as the 
father of Alchemy; his name has supplied a synonym for the Art&mdash;the 
Hermetic Art&mdash;and even to-day we speak of <hi rend="italic">hermetically</hi> sealing 
flasks and the like. But who Hermes actually was, or even if there were 
such a personage, is a matter of conjecture. The alchemists themselves 
supposed him to have been an Egyptian living about the time of Moses. He 
is now generally regarded as purely mythical&mdash;a personification of 
Thoth, the Egyptian God of learning; but, of course, some person or 
persons must have written the works attributed to him, and the first of 
such writers (if, as seems not unlikely, there were more than one) may 
be considered to have a right to the name. Of these works, the <hi rend="italic">Divine 
Pymander</hi>,<ref target="RedAlch3.2" n="42">2</ref> a mystical-religious 
treatise, is the most important. <hi rend="italic">The Golden Tractate</hi>, also 
attributed to Hermes, which is an exceedingly obscure alchemistic work, 
is now regarded as having been written at a comparatively late date.</p>

<head>&sect; 30. The Smaragdine Table.</head> 
 
<p>In a work attributed to Albertus Magnus, but which is probably 
spurious, we are told that Alexander the Great found the tomb of Hermes 
in a cave near Hebron. This tomb contained an emerald table&mdash;"The 
Smaragdine Table"&mdash;on which were inscribed the following thirteen 
sentences in Ph&oelig;nician characters:&mdash;</p> 
 
<list type="simple"> 
 
<item>1. I speak not fictitious things, but what is true and most 
certain.</item> 
 
<pb n="41"/>  
 
<item>2. What is below is like that which is above, and what is above is 
like that which is below, to accomplish the miracles of one 
thing.</item> 
 
<item>3. And as all things were produced by the mediation of one Being, 
so all things were produced from this one thing by adaptation.</item> 
 
<item>4. Its father is the Sun, its mother the Moon; the wind carries it 
in its belly, its nurse is the earth.</item> 
 
<item>5. It is the cause of all perfection throughout the whole 
world.</item> 
 
<item>6. Its power is perfect if it be changed into earth.</item> 
 
<item>7. Separate the earth from the fire, the subtle from the gross, 
acting prudently and with judgment.</item> 
 
<item>8. Ascend with the greatest sagacity from the earth to heaven, and 
then again descend to the earth, and unite together the powers of things 
superior and things inferior. Thus you will obtain the glory of the 
whole world, and all obscurity will fly far away from you.</item> 
 
<item>9. This thing is the fortitude of all fortitude, because it 
overcomes all subtle things, and penetrates every solid thing.</item> 
 
<item>10. Thus were all things created.</item> 
 
<item>11. Thence proceed wonderful adaptations which are produced in 
this way.</item> 
 
<item>12. Therefore am I called Hermes Trismegistus, possessing the 
three parts of the philosophy of the whole world.</item> 
 
<item>13. That which I had to say concerning the operation of the Sun is 
completed.</item> 
 
<item>These sentences clearly teach the doctrine of the alchemistic 
essence or "One Thing," which is everywhere present, penetrating even 
solids (this we should 
 
<pb n="42"/>  
 
note is true of the ether of space), and out of which all things of the 
physical world are made by adaptation or modification. The terms Sun and 
Moon in the above passage probably stand for Spirit and Matter 
respectively, not gold and silver.</item>

<head>&sect; 31. Zosimus of Panopolis.</head> 
 
<p>One of the earliest of the alchemists of whom record remains was 
<hi rend="bold">Zosimus of Panopolis</hi>, who flourished in the fifth century, and 
was regarded by the later alchemists as a master of the Art. He is said 
to have written many treatises dealing with Alchemy, but only fragments 
remain. Of these fragments, Professor Venable says: " . . . they give us 
a good idea of the learning of the man and of his times. They contain 
descriptions of apparatus, of furnaces, studies of minerals, of alloys, 
of glass making, of mineral waters, and much that is mystical, besides a 
good deal referring to the transmutation of metals." 
<ref target="RedAlch3.3" n="43">3</ref> Zosimus is said to have been the author of 
the saying, "like begets like," but whether all the fragments ascribed 
to him were really his work is doubtful. 
 
</p><p>Among other early alchemists we may mention also

<head>&sect; 32. Geber.</head> 
 
<p>In the seventh century the Arabians conquered Egypt; and strangely 
enough, Alchemy flourished under them to a remarkable degree. Of all the 
Arabian alchemists, <hi rend="bold">Geber</hi> has been regarded as the greatest; as 
Professor Meyer says: "there can be no dispute that with the name Geber 
was propagated the memory of a personality 
 
<pb n="43"/>  
 
with which the chemical knowledge of the time was bound up." 
<ref target="RedAlch3.4" n="44">4</ref> Geber is supposed to have lived about the 
ninth century, but of his life nothing definite is known. A large number 
of works have been ascribed to him, of which the majority are unknown, 
but the four Latin MSS. which have been printed under the titles 
<hi rend="italic">Summa Perfectionis Mettalorum</hi>, <hi rend="italic">De Investigatione Perfectionis 
Metallorum</hi>, <hi rend="italic">De Invertione Veritatis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">De Fornacibus 
Construendis</hi>, were, until a few years ago, regarded as genuine. On 
the strength of these works, Geber has ranked high as a chemist. In them 
are described the preparation of many important chemical compounds; the 
most essential chemical operations, such as sublimation, distillation, 
filtration, crystallisation (or coagulation, as the alchemists called 
it), &amp;c.; and also important chemical apparatus, for example, the 
water-bath, improved furnaces, &amp;c. However, it was shown by the late 
Professor Berthelot that <hi rend="italic">Summa Perfectionis Mettalorum</hi> is a 
forgery of the fourteenth century, and the other works forgeries of an 
even later date.  Moreover, the original Arabic MSS. of Geber have been 
brought to light. These true writings of Geber are very obscure; they 
give no warrant for believing that the famous sulphur-mercury theory was 
due to this alchemist, and they prove him not to be the expert chemist 
that he was supposed to have been.  The spurious writings mentioned 
above show that the pseudo-Geber was a man of wide chemical knowledge 
and experience, and play a not inconsiderable part in the history of 
Alchemy.</p>

time after Geber; and to whom, perhaps, the sulphur-mercury theory may 
have been to some extent due.

<p><hi rend="bold">Albertus Magnus</hi>, Albert Groot or Albert von Bollst&auml;dt 
(see plate 7), was born at Lauingen, probably in 1193. He was educated 
at Padua, and in his later years he showed himself apt at acquiring the 
knowledge of his time. He studied theology, philosophy and natural 
science, and is chiefly celebrated as an Aristotelean philosopher. He 
entered the Dominican order, taught publicly at Cologne, Paris and 
elsewhere, and was made provincial of this order. Later he had the 
bishopric of Regensburg conferred on him, but he retired after a few 
years to a Dominican cloister, where he devoted himself to philosophy 
and science. He was one of the most learned men of his time and, 
moreover, a man of noble character. The authenticity of the alchemistic 
works attributed to him has been questioned.</p>

imbibed alchemistic learning. It is very probable, however, that the

<head>&sect; 36. Roger Bacon.</head> 
 
<p><hi rend="bold">Roger Bacon</hi>, the most illustrious of the medi&aelig;val 
alchemists, was born near Ilchester in Somerset, probably in 1214. His 
erudition, considering the general state of ignorance prevailing at this 
time, was most remarkable.  Professor Meyer says: "He is to be regarded 
as the intellectual originator of experimental research, if the 
departure in this direction is to be coupled with any one name&mdash;a 
direction which, followed more and more as time went on, gave to the 
science [of Chemistry] its own peculiar stamp, and ensured its steady 
development."<ref target="RedAlch3.6" n="46">6</ref> Roger Bacon studied 
theology and science at Oxford and at Paris; and he joined the 
Franciscan order, at what date, however, is uncertain.  He was 
particularly interested in optics, and certain discoveries in this 
branch of physics have been attributed to him, though probably 
erroneously. It appears, also, that he was acquainted with gunpowder, 
which was, however, not employed in Europe until many years later. 
<ref target="RedAlch3.7" n="47">7</ref> Unfortunately, he earned the undesirable 
reputation of being in communication with the powers of darkness, and as 
he did not hesitate to oppose many of the opinions current at the time, 
he 
 
<pb n="46"/>  
 
suffered much persecution. He was a firm believer in the powers of the 
Philosopher's Stone to transmute large quantities of "base" metal into 
gold, and also to extend the life of the individual. <hi rend="italic">"Alchimy</hi>," 
he says, "is a Science, teaching how to transforme any kind of mettall 
into another: and that by a proper medicine, as it appeareth by many 
Philosophers Bookes. <hi rend="italic">Alchimy</hi> therefore is a science teaching how 
to make and compound a certaine medicine, which is called <hi rend="italic">Elixir</hi>, 
the which when it is cast upon mettals or imperfect bodies, doth fully 
perfect them in the verie projection."<ref target="RedAlch3.8" n="48">8</ref> 
He also believed in Astrology; but, nevertheless, he was entirely 
opposed to many of the magical and superstitious notions held at the 
time, and his tract, <hi rend="italic">De Secretis Operibus Artis et Natur&aelig;, et 
de Nullitate Magi&aelig;</hi>, was an endeavour to prove that many 
so-called "miracles" could be brought about simply by the aid of natural 
science. Roger Bacon was a firm supporter of the Sulphur-Mercury theory: 
he says: " . . . the natural principles in the mynes, are 
<hi rend="italic">Argent-vive</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Sulphur</hi>. All mettals and minerals, 
whereof there be sundrie and divers kinds, are begotten of these two: 
but I must tel you, that nature alwaies intendeth and striveth to the 
perfection of Gold: but many accidents coming between, change the 
metalls.... For according to the puritie and impuritie of the two 
aforesaide principles, <hi rend="italic">Argent-vive</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Sulphur</hi>, pure, and 
impure mettals are ingendred."<ref target="RedAlch3.9" n="49">9</ref> He 
expresses surprise that any should employ animal and vegetable 
substances in their attempts to prepare the Stone, a practice common to 
some alchemists but warmly criticised by 
 
<pb n="47"/>  
 
others. He says: "Nothing may be mingled with mettalls which hath not 
beene made or sprung from them, it remaineth cleane inough, that no 
strange thing which hath not his originall from these two [viz., sulphur 
and mercury], is able to perfect them, or to make a chaunge and new 
transmutation of them: so that it is to be wondered at, that any wise 
man should set his mind upon living creatures, or vegetables which are 
far off, when there be minerals to bee found nigh enough: neither may we 
in any wise thinke, that any of the Philosophers placed the Art in the 
said remote things, except it were by way of comparison." 
<ref target="RedAlch3.10" n="50">10</ref> The one process necessary for the 
preparation of the Stone, he tells us, is "continuall concoction" in the 
fire, which is the method that "God hath given to nature."

<p>The date and birthplace of <hi rend="bold">Arnold de Villanova</hi>, or Villeneuve, 
are both uncertain. He studied medicine at Paris, and in the latter part 
of the thirteenth century practised professionally in Barcelona. To 
avoid persecution at the hands of the Inquisition, he was obliged to 
leave Spain, and ultimately found safety with Frederick II. in Sicily. 
He was famous not only as an alchemist, but also as a skilful physician.

<head>&sect; 38. Raymond Lully.</head> 
 
<p><hi rend="bold">Raymond Lully</hi>, the son of a noble Spanish family, was born at 
Palma (in Majorca) about 1235.  He was a man of somewhat eccentric 
character&mdash;in his youth a man of pleasure; in his maturity, 
 
<pb n="48"/>  
 
a mystic and ascetic. His career was of a roving and adventurous 
character. We are told that, in his younger days, although married, he 
became violently infatuated with a lady of the name of Ambrosia de 
Castello, who vainly tried to dissuade him from his profane passion. Her 
efforts proving futile, she requested Lully to call upon her, and in the 
presence of her husband, bared to his sight her breast, which was almost 
eaten away by a cancer. This sight&mdash;so the story goes&mdash;brought about 
Lully's conversion. He became actuated by the idea of converting to 
Christianity the heathen in Africa, and engaged the services of an 
Arabian whereby he might learn the language. The man, however, 
discovering his master's object, attempted to assassinate him, and Lully 
narrowly escaped with his life. But his enthusiasm for missionary work 
never abated&mdash;his central idea was the reasonableness and 
demonstrability of Christian doctrine&mdash;and unhappily he was, at last, 
stoned to death by the inhabitants of Bugiah (in Algeria) in 1315. 
<ref target="RedAlch3.12" n="52">12</ref> 
 
</p><p>A very large number of alchemistic, theological and other 
treatises are attributed to Lully, many of which are undoubtedly 
spurious; and it is a difficult question to decide exactly which are 
genuine. He is supposed to have derived a knowledge of Alchemy from 
Roger Bacon and Arnold de Villanova. It appears more probable, however, 
either that Lully the alchemist was a personage distinct from the Lully 
whose life we have sketched above, or that the alchemistic writings 
attributed to him are forgeries of a similar nature to 
 
<pb n="49"/>  
 
the works of pseudo-Geber (&sect; 32). Of these alchemical writings we 
may here mention the <hi rend="italic">Clavicula</hi>.  This he says is the key to all 
his other books on Alchemy, in which books the whole Art is fully 
declared, though so obscurely as not to be understandable without its 
aid. In this work an alleged method for what may be called the 
multiplication of the "noble" metals rather than transmutation is 
described in clear language; but it should be noticed that the stone 
employed is itself a compound either of silver or gold. According to 
Lully, the secret of the Philosopher's Stone is the extraction of the 
mercury of silver or gold. He writes: "Metals cannot be transmuted.... 
in the Minerals, unless they be reduced into their first Matter.... 
Therefore I counsel you, O my Friends, that you do not work but about 
<hi rend="italic">Sol</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Luna</hi>, reducing them into the first Matter, our

<head>&sect; 39. Peter Bonus.</head> 
 
<p>In 1546, a work was published entitled <hi rend="italic">Magarita Pretiosa</hi>, 
which claimed to be a "faithful abridgement," by "Janus Lacinus 
Therapus, the Calabrian," of a MS.  written by <hi rend="bold">Peter Bonus</hi> in the 
fourteenth century. An abridged English translation of this book by Mr. 
A. E. Waite was published in 1894. Of the life of Bonus, who is said to 
have been an inhabitant of Pola, a seaport 
 
<pb n="50"/>  
 
of Istria, nothing is known; but the <hi rend="italic">Magarita Pretiosa</hi> is an 
alchemistic work of considerable interest. The author commences, like 
pseudo-Geber in his <hi rend="italic">Sum of Perfection</hi>, by bringing forward a 
number of very ingenious arguments against the validity of the Art; he 
then proceeds with arguments in favour of Alchemy and puts forward 
answers in full to the former objections; further difficulties, &amp;c., are 
then dealt with. In all this, compared with many other alchemists, 
Bonus, though somewhat prolix, is remarkably lucid. All metals, he 
argues, following the views of pseudo-Geber, consist of mercury and 
sulphur; but whilst the mercury is always one and the same, different 
metals contain different sulphurs. There are also two different kinds of 
sulphurs&mdash;inward and outward. Sulphur is necessary for the development 
of the mercury, but for the final product, gold, to come forth, it is 
necessary that the outward and impure sulphur be purged off. "Each 
metal," says Bonus, "differs from all the rest, and has a certain 
perfection and completeness of its own; but none, except gold, has 
reached that highest degree of perfection of which it is capable. For 
all common metals there is a transient and a perfect state of inward 
completeness, and this perfect state they attain either through the slow 
operation of Nature, or through the sudden transformatory power of our 
Stone.  We must, however, add that the imperfect metals form part of the 
great plan and design of Nature, though they are in course of 
transformation into gold.  For a large number of very useful and 
indispensable tools and utensils could not be provided at all if there 
were no copper, iron, tin, or lead, and if all metals 
 
<pb n="51"/>  
 
were either silver or gold. For this beneficent reason Nature has 
furnished us with the metallic substance in all its different stages of 
development, from iron, or the lowest, to gold, or the highest state of 
metallic perfection. Nature is ever studying variety, and, for that 
reason, instead of covering the whole face of the earth with water, has 
evolved out of that elementary substance a great diversity of forms, 
embracing the whole animal, vegetable and mineral world. It is, in like 
manner, for the use of men that Nature has differentiated the metallic 
substance into a great variety of species and forms." 
<ref target="RedAlch3.14" n="54">14</ref> According to this interesting alchemistic 
work, the Art of Alchemy consists, not in reducing the imperfect metals 
to their first substance, but in carrying forward Nature's work, 
developing the imperfect metals to perfection and removing their impure 
sulphur.</p>

<head>&sect; 40. Nicolas Flamel.</head> 
 
<p><hi rend="bold">Nicolas Flamel</hi> (see plate 8) was born about 1330, probably in 
Paris. His parents were poor, and Nicolas took up the trade of a 
scrivener.  In the course of time, Flamel became a very wealthy man and, 
at the same time, it appears, one who exhibited considerable 
munificence. This increase in Flamel's wealth has been attributed to 
supposed success in the Hermetic Art. We are told that a remarkable book 
came into the young scrivener's possession, which, at first, he was 
unable to understand, until, at last, he had the good fortune to meet an 
adept who translated its mysteries for him. This book revealed the 
occult secrets of Alchemy, and by its means Nicolas was enabled 
 
<pb n="52"/>  
 
to obtain immense quantities of gold. This story, however, appears to be 
of a legendary nature, and it seems more likely that Flamel's riches 
resulted from his business as a scrivener and from moneylending. At any 
rate, all of the alchemistic works attributed to Flamel are of more or 
less questionable origin. One of these, entitled <hi rend="italic">A Short Tract, or 
Philosophical Summary</hi>, will be found in <hi rend="italic">The Hermetic Museum</hi>. 
It is a very brief work, supporting the sulphur-mercury theory.</p>

<p>Probably the most celebrated of all alchemistic books is the work 
known as <hi rend="italic">Triumph-Wagen des Antimonii</hi>. A Latin translation with a 
commentary by Theodore Kerckringius was published in 1685, and an 
English translation of this version by Mr A. E. Waite appeared in 1893. 
The author describes himself as <hi rend="bold">"Basil Valentine</hi>, a Benedictine 
monk." In his <hi rend="italic">"Practica</hi>," another alchemistic work, he says: 
"When I had emptied to the dregs the cup of human suffering, I was led 
to consider the wretchedness of this world, and the fearful consequences 
of our first parents' disobedience . . .  I made haste to withdraw 
myself from the evil world, to bid farewell to it, and to devote myself 
to the Service of God."<ref target="RedAlch3.15" n="55">15</ref> He proceeds 
to relate that he entered a monastery, but finding that he had some time 
on his hands after performing his daily work and devotions, and not 
wishing to pass this time in idleness, he took up the study of Alchemy, 
"the investigation of those natural secrets by which God has

the discovery of a Stone most potent in the curing of diseases. In 
<hi rend="italic">The Triumphal Chariot of Antimony</hi> are accurately described a 
large number of antimonial preparations, and as Basil was supposed to 
have written this work some time in the fifteenth century, these 
preparations were accordingly concluded to have been, for the most part, 
his own discoveries.  He defends with the utmost vigour the medicinal 
values of antimony, and criticises in terms far from mild the physicians 
of his day. On account of this work Basil Valentine has ranked very high 
as an experimental chemist; but from quite early times its date and 
authorship have been regarded alike as doubtful; and it appears from the 
researches of the late Professor Schorlemmer "to be an undoubted forgery 
dating from about 1600, the information being culled from the works of 
other writers. . ."<ref target="RedAlch3.16" n="56">16</ref> Probably the 
other works ascribed to Basil Valentine are of a like nature. <hi rend="italic">The

this world are of a dual nature, partly good and partly bad. " . . . All

lower parts, whether it be in beasts, fishes, and all manner of sensible

says that Thomas Norton was a member of the privy chamber of Edward IV. 
Norton's distinctive views regarding the generation of the metals we

of the Art of Alchemy could only be obtained by word of mouth from an

initiation. He tells us that he was instructed by his master (probably 
Sir George Ripley) and learnt the secrets of the Art in forty days, at 
the age of twenty-eight. He does not, however, appear to have reaped the 
fruits of this knowledge. Twice, he tells us, did he prepare the Elixir,

<div2 type="section" n="46" id="d59"> 
<head>&sect; 46. Paracelsus.</head> 
 
<p>That erratic genius, <hi rend="bold">Paracelsus</hi>&mdash;or, to give him his correct 
name, Philip (?) Aureole (?)  <hi rend="bold">Theophrast Bombast von Hohenheim</hi>&mdash; 
whose portrait forms the frontispiece to the present work&mdash;was born at 
Einsiedeln in Switzerland in 1493. He studied the and medical arts under 
his father, who was a physician, and continued his studies later at the 
University of Basle. He also gave some time to the study of magic and 
the occult sciences under the famous Trithemius of Spanheim. Paracelsus, 
however, found the merely theoretical "book learning" of the university 
curriculum unsatisfactory and betook himself to the mines, where he 
might study the nature of metals at first hand. He then spent several 
years in travelling, visiting some of the chief countries of Europe. At 
last he returned to Basle, the chair of Medical Science of his old 
university being bestowed upon him. The works of Isaac of Holland had 
inspired him with the desire to improve upon the medical science of his 
day, and in his lectures (which were, 
 
<pb n="59"/>  
 
contrary to the usual custom, delivered not in Latin, but in the German 
language) he denounced in violent terms the teachings of Galen and 
Avicenna, who were until then the accredited authorities on medical 
matters. His use of the German tongue, his coarseness in criticism and 
his intense self-esteem, combined with the fact that he did lay bare 
many of the medical follies and frauds of his day, brought him into very 
general dislike with the rest of the physicians, and the municipal 
authorities siding with the aggrieved apothecaries and physicians, whose 
methods Paracelsus had exposed, he fled from Basle and resumed his 
former roving life. He was, so we are told, a man of very intemperate 
habits, being seldom sober (a statement seriously open to doubt); but on 
the other hand, he certainly accomplished a very large number of most 
remarkable cures, and, judging from his writings, he was inspired by 
lofty and noble ideals and a fervent belief in the Christian religion. 
He died in 1241. 
 
</p><p>Paracelsus combined in himself such opposite characteristics that 
it is a matter of difficulty to criticise him aright. As says Professor 
Ferguson: "It is most difficult . . . to ascertain what his true 
character really was, to appreciate aright this man of fervid 
imagination, of powerful and persistent conviction, of unbated honesty 
and love of truth, of keen insight into the errors (as he thought them) 
of his time, of a merciless will to lay bare these errors and to reform 
the abuses to which they gave rise, who in an instant offends by his 
boasting, his grossness, his want of self-respect. It is a problem how 
to reconcile his ignorance, his weakness, his superstition, his crude 
 
<pb n="60"/>  
 
notions, his erroneous observations, his ridiculous inferences and 
theories, with his grasp of method, his lofty views of the true scope of 
medicine, his lucid statements, his incisive and epigrammatic criticisms 
of men and motives."<ref target="RedAlch4.1" n="62">1</ref> It is also a 
problem of considerable difficulty to determine which of the many books 
attributed to him are really his genuine works, and consequently what 
his views on certain points exactly were.</p> 
</div2> 
 
<div2 type="section" n="47" id="d60"> 
<head>&sect; 47. Views of Paracelsus.</head> 
 
<p>Paracelsus was the first to recognise the desirability of 
investigating the physical universe with a motive other than 
alchemistic.  He taught that "the object of chemistry is not to make 
gold, but to prepare medicines," and founded the school of 
Iatro-chemistry or Medical Chemistry. This synthesis of chemistry with 
medicine was of very great benefit to each science; new possibilities of 
chemical investigation were opened up now that the aim was not purely 
alchemistic. Paracelsus's central theory was that of the analogy between 
man, the microcosm, and the world or macrocosm. He regarded all the 
actions that go on in the human body as of a chemical nature, and he 
thought that illness was the result of a disproportion in the body 
between the quantities of the three great principles&mdash;sulphur, mercury, 
and salt&mdash;which he regarded as constituting all things; for example, he 
considered an excess of sulphur as the cause of fever, since sulphur was 
the fiery principle, &amp;c.  The basis of the iatro-chemical doctrines, 
namely, that the healthy human body is a particular combination of 
 
<pb n="61"/>  
 
chemical substances: illness the result of some change in this 
combination, and hence curable only by chemical medicines, expresses a 
certain truth, and is undoubtedly a great improvement upon the ideas of 
the ancients. But in the elaboration of his medical doctrines Paracelsus 
fell a prey to exaggeration and the fantastic, and many of his theories 
appear to be highly ridiculous. This extravagance is also very 
pronounced in the alchemistic works attributed to him; for example, the 
belief in the artificial creation of minute living creatures resembling 
men (called "homunculi")&mdash;a belief of the utmost absurdity, if we are to 
understand it literally. On the other hand, his writings do contain much 
true teaching of a mystical nature; his doctrine of the correspondence 
of man with the universe considered as a whole, for example, certainly 
being radically true, though fantastically stated and developed by 
Paracelsus himself.</p> 
</div2> 
 
<div2 type="section" n="48" id="d61"> 
<head>&sect; 48. Iatro-Chemistry.</head> 
 
<p>Between the pupils of Paracelsus and the older school of medicine, as 
might well be supposed, a battle royal was waged for a considerable 
time, which ultimately concluded, if not with a full vindication of 
Paracelsus's teaching, yet with the acceptance of the fundamental 
iatro-chemical doctrines. Henceforward it is necessary to distinguish 
between the chemists and the alchemists&mdash;to distinguish those who 
pursued chemical studies with the object of discovering and preparing 
useful medicines, and later those who pursued such studies for their own 
sake, from those whose object was the transmutation of the "base" metals 
into gold, whether from purely selfish motives, or with the desire to 
 
<pb n="62"/>  
 
demonstrate on the physical plane the validity of the doctrines of 
Mysticism. However, during the following century or two we find, very 
often, the chemist and the alchemist united in one and the same person. 
Men such as Glauber and Boyle, whose names will ever be remembered by 
chemists, did not doubt the possibility of performing the <hi rend="italic">magnum 
opus</hi>. In the present chapter, however, we shall confine our 
attention for the most part to those men who may be regarded, for one 
reason or another, particularly as <hi rend="italic">alchemists</hi>. And the alchemists 
of the period we are now considering present a very great diversity. On 
the one hand, we have men of much chemical knowledge and skill such as 
Libavius and van Helmont, on the other hand we have those who stand 
equally as high as exponents of mystic wisdom&mdash;men such as Jacob Boehme 
and, to a less extent, Thomas Vaughan.  We have those, who, although 
they did not enrich the science of Chemistry with any new discoveries, 
were, nevertheless, regarded as masters of the Hermetic Art; and, 
finally, we have alchemists of the Edward Kelley and "Cagliostro" type, 
whose main object was their own enrichment at their neighbours' expense. 
Before, however, proceeding to an account of the lives and teachings of 
these men, there is one curious matter&mdash;perhaps the most remarkable of 
all historical curiosities&mdash;that calls for some brief consideration. We 
refer to the "far-famed" Rosicrucian Society.</p> 
</div2> 
 
<div2 type="section" n="49" id="d62"> 
<head>&sect; 49. The Rosicrucian Society.</head> 
 
<p>The exoteric history of the Rosicrucian Society commences with the 
year 1614. In that year there was published at Cassel in Germany a 
pamphlet entitled <hi rend="italic">The Discovery of the Fraternity of the Meritorious 
Order of the Rosy Cross, addressed to</hi> 
 
<pb n="63"/>  
 
<hi rend="italic">the Learned in General and the Governors of Europe</hi>.  After a 
discussion of the momentous question of the general reformation of the 
world, which was to be accomplished through the medium of a secret 
confederacy of the wisest and most philanthropic men, the pamphlet 
proceeds to inform its readers that such an association is in existence, 
founded over one hundred years ago by the famous C.R.C., grand initiate 
in the mysteries of Alchemy, whose history (which is clearly of a 
fabulous or symbolical nature) is given. The book concludes by inviting 
the wise men of the time to join the Fraternity, directing those who 
wished to do so to indicate their desire by the publication of printed 
letters, which should come into the hands of the Brotherhood. As might 
well be expected, the pamphlet was the cause of considerable interest 
and excitement, but although many letters were printed, apparently none 
of them were vouchsafed a reply.  The following year a further pamphlet 
appeared, <hi rend="italic">The Confession of the Rosicrucian Fraternity, addressed to 
the Learned in Europe</hi>, and in 1616, <hi rend="italic">The Chymical Nuptials of 
Christian Rosencreutz</hi>. This latter book is a remarkable allegorical 
romance, describing how an old man, a lifelong student of the 
alchemistic Art, was present at the accomplishment of the <hi rend="italic">magnum 
opus</hi> in the year 1459. An enormous amount of controversy took place; 
it was plain to some that the Society had deluded them, whilst others 
hotly maintained its claims; but after about four years had passed, the 
excitement had subsided, and the subject ceased, for the time being, to 
arouse any particular interest. 
 
</p><p>Some writers, even in recent times, more gifted for 
 
<pb n="64"/>  
 
romance than for historical research, have seen in the Rosicrucian 
Society a secret confederacy of immense antiquity and of stupendous 
powers, consisting of the great initiates of all ages, supposed to be in 
possession of the arch secrets of alchemistic art. It is abundantly 
evident, however, that it was nothing of the sort. It is clear from an 
examination of the pamphlets already mentioned that they are animated by 
Lutheran ideals; and it is of interest to note that Luther's seal 
contained both the cross and the rose&mdash;whence the term "Rosicrucian." 
The generally accepted theory regards the pamphlets as a sort of 
elaborate hoax perpetrated by Valentine Andrea, a young and benevolent 
Lutheran divine; but more, however, than a mere hoax. As the late Mr. R. 
A. Vaughan wrote: " . . . this Andrea writes the <hi rend="italic">Discovery of the 
Rosicrucian Brotherhood, a jeu-d'esprit</hi> with a serious purpose, just 
as an experiment to see whether something cannot be done by combined 
effort to remedy the defect and abuses&mdash;social, educational, and 
religious, so lamented by all good men. He thought there were many 
Andreas scattered throughout Europe&mdash;how powerful would be their united 
systematic action! . . .  He hoped that the few nobler minds whom he 
desired to organize would see through the veil of fiction in which he 
had invested his proposal; that he might communicate personally with 
some such, if they should appear; or that his book might lead them to 
form among themselves a practical philanthropic confederacy, answering 
to the serious purpose he had embodied in his fiction." 
<ref target="RedAlch4.2" n="63">2</ref> His scheme was a 
 
<pb n="65"/>  
 
failure, and on seeing its result, Andrea, not daring to reveal himself 
as the author of the pamphlets, did his best to put a stop to the folly 
by writing several works in criticism of the Society and its claims. Mr. 
A. E. Waite, however, whose work on the subject should be consulted for 
further information, rejects this theory, and suggests that the 
Rosicrucian Society was probably identical with the <hi rend="italic">Militia Crucifera 
Evangelica</hi>, a secret society founded in Nuremburg by the Lutheran 
alchemist and mystic, Simon Studion.<ref target="RedAlch4.3" n="64">3</ref></p>

<p>We must now turn our attention to the lives and teachings of the 
alchemists of the period under consideration, treating them, as far as 
possible, in chronological order; whence the first alchemist to come 
under our notice is Thomas Charnock. 
 
</p><p><hi rend="bold">Thomas Charnock</hi> was born at Faversham (Kent), either in 
the year 1524 or in 1526. After some travels over England he settled at 
Oxford, carrying on experiments in Alchemy. In 1557 he wrote his 
<hi rend="italic">Breviary of Philosophy</hi>. This work is almost entirely 
autobiographical, describing Charnock's alchemistic experiences. He 
tells us that he was initiated into the mysteries of the Hermetic Art by 
a certain James S. of Salisbury; he also had another master, an old 
blind man, who on his death-bed instructed Charnock.  Unfortunately, 
however, Thomas was doomed to failure in his experiments. On the first 
attempt his apparatus caught fire and his work was destroyed.  His next 
experiments were ruined by the negligence of a servant. His final 
misfortune shall be described 
 
<pb n="66"/>  
 
in his own words. He had started the work for a third time, and had 
spent much money on his fire, hoping to be shortly rewarded....</p>

<p>Thomas Charnock married in 1562 a Miss Agnes Norden. He died in 1581. 
It is, perhaps, unnecessary to say that his name does not appear in the 
history of Chemistry.</p>

<head>&sect; 51. Andreas Libavius.</head> 
 
<p><hi rend="bold">Andreas Libavius</hi> was born at Halle in Germany in 1540, where 
he studied medicine and practised for a short time as a physician.  He 
accepted the fundamental iatro-chemical doctrines, at the same time, 
however, criticising certain of the more extravagant views expressed by 
Paracelsus. He was a firm believer in the transmutation of the metals, 
but his own activities were chiefly directed to the preparation of new 
and better medicines. He enriched the science of Chemistry by many 
valuable discoveries, and tin tetra-chloride, which he was the first to 
prepare, is still known by the name of <hi rend="italic">spiritus fumans Libavii</hi>. 
Libavius was a man possessed of keen powers of observation; and his work 
on Chemistry, which contains a full account of the knowledge of the 
science of his time, may be 
 
<pb n="67"/>  
 
regarded as the first text-book of Chemistry. It was held in high esteem 
for a considerable time, being reprinted on several occasions.</p>

<head>&sect; 52. Edward Kelley and John Dee.</head> 
 
<p><hi rend="bold">Edward Kelley</hi> or Kelly (see plate 9) was born at Worcester on 
August 1, 1555. His life is so obscured by various traditions that It is 
very difficult to arrive at the truth concerning it. The latest, and 
probably the best, account will be found in Miss Charlotte Fell Smith's 
John Dee (1909). Edward Kelley, according to some accounts, was brought 
up as an apothecary.<ref target="RedAlch4.5" n="66">5</ref> He is also said 
to have entered Oxford University under the pseudonym of Talbot. 
<ref target="RedAlch4.6" n="67">6</ref> Later, he practised as a notary in London. 
He is said to have committed a forgery, for which he had his ears 
cropped; but another account, which supposes him to have avoided this 
penalty by making his escape to Wales, is not improbable. Other crimes 
of which he is accused are coining and necromancy. He was probably not 
guilty of all these crimes, but that he was undoubtedly a charlatan and 
profligate the sequel will make plain.  We are told that about the time 
of his alleged escape to Wales, whilst in the neighbourhood of 
Glastonbury Abbey, he became possessed, by a lucky chance, of a 
manuscript by St. Dunstan setting forth the grand secrets of Alchemy, 
together with some of the two transmuting tinctures, both white and 
red,<ref target="RedAlch4.7" n="68">7</ref> 
 
<pb n="68"/>  
 
which had been discovered in a tomb near by. His friendship with John 
Dee, or Dr. Dee as he is generally called, commenced in 1582. Now, 
<hi rend="bold">John Dee</hi> (see plate 9) was undoubtedly a mathematician of 
considerable erudition. He was also an astrologer, and was much 
interested in experiments in "crystal-gazing," for which purpose he 
employed a speculum of polished cannel-coal, and by means of which he 
believed that he had communication with the inhabitants of spiritual 
spheres. It appears that Kelley, who probably did possess some 
mediumistic powers, the results of which he augmented by means of fraud, 
interested himself in these experiments, and not only became the 
doctor's "scryer," but also gulled him into the belief that he was in 
the possession of the arch-secrets of Alchemy. In 1583, Kelley and his 
learned dupe left England together with their wives and a Polish 
nobleman, staying firstly at Cracovia and afterwards at Prague, where it 
is not unlikely that the Emperor Rudolph II. knighted Kelley. As 
instances of the belief which the doctor had in Kelley's powers as an 
alchemist, we may note that in his Private Diary under the date December 
19, 1586, Dee records that Kelley performed a transmutation for the 
benefit of one Edward Garland and his brother Francis; 
<ref target="RedAlch4.8" n="69">8</ref> and

under the date May 10, 1588, we find the following recorded: "E.K. did 
open the great secret to me, God be thanked!" 
<ref target="RedAlch4.9" n="70">9</ref> That he was not always without doubts as to 
Kelley's honesty, however, is evident from other entries in his Diary. 
In 1587 occurred an event which must be recorded to the partners' 
lasting shame. To cap his former impositions, Kelley informed the doctor 
that by the orders of a spirit which had appeared to him in the crystal, 
they were to share "their two wives in common"; to which arrangement, 
after some further persuasion, Dee consented.  Kelley's profligacy and 
violent temper, however, had already been the cause of some disagreement 
between him and the doctor, and this incident leading to a further 
quarrel, the erstwhile friends parted. In 1589, the Emperor Rudolph 
imprisoned Kelley, the price of his freedom being the transmutative 
secret, or a substantial quantity of gold, at least, prepared by its 
aid. He was, however, released in 1593; but died in 1595; according to 
one account, as the result of an accident incurred while attempting to 
escape from a second imprisonment. Dee merely records that he received 
news to the effect that Kelley "was slayne." 
 
</p><p>It was during his incarceration that he wrote an alchemistic work 
entitled <hi rend="italic">The Stone of the Philosophers</hi>, which consists largely of 
quotations from older alchemistic writings. His other works on Alchemy 
were probably written at an earlier period.

<p>The date and birthplace of <hi rend="bold">Alexander Sethon</hi>, a Scottish 
alchemist, do not appear to have been recorded, but <hi rend="bold">Michael 
Sendivogius</hi> was probably born in Moravia about 1566. Sethon, we are 
told, was in possession of the arch-secrets of Alchemy. He visited 
Holland in 1602, proceeded after a time to Italy, and passed through 
Basle to Germany; meanwhile he is said to have performed many 
transmutations. Ultimately arriving at Dresden, however, he fell into 
the clutches of the young Elector, Christian II., who, in order to 
extort his secret, cast him into prison, and put him to the torture, but 
without avail. Now, it so happened that Sendivogius, who was in quest of 
the Philosopher's Stone, was staying at Dresden, and hearing of Sethon's 
imprisonment obtained permission to visit him. Sendivogius offered to 
effect Sethon's escape in return for assistance in his alchemistic 
pursuits, to which arrangement the Scottish alchemist willingly agreed. 
After some considerable outlay of money in bribery, Sendivogius's 
 
<pb n="71"/>  
 
plan of escape was successfully carried out, and Sethon found himself a 
free man; but he refused to betray the high secrets of Hermetic 
philosophy to his rescuer. However, before his death, which occurred 
shortly afterwards, he presented him with an ounce of the transmutative 
powder. Sendivogius soon used up this powder, we are told, in effecting 
transmutations and cures, and, being fond of expensive living, he 
married Sethon's widow, in the hope that she was in the possession of 
the transmutative secret.  In this, however, he was disappointed; she 
knew nothing of the matter, but she had the manuscript of an alchemistic 
work written by her late husband.  Shortly afterwards Sendivogius 
printed at Prague a book entitled <hi rend="italic">The New Chemical Light</hi> under 
the name of "Cosmopolita," which is said to be this work of Sethon's but 
which Sendivogius claimed for his own by the insertion of his name on 
the title-page, in the form of an anagram. The tract <hi rend="italic">On Sulphur</hi> 
which was printed at the end of later editions, however, is said to have 
been the genuine work of the Moravian.  Whilst his powder lasted, 
Sendivogius travelled about, performing, we are told, many 
transmutations. He was twice imprisoned in order to extort the secrets 
of Alchemy from him, on one occasion escaping, and on the other occasion 
obtaining his release from the Emperor Rudolph. Afterwards, he appears 
to have degenerated into an impostor, but this is said to have been a 
<hi rend="italic">finesse</hi> to hide his true character as an alchemistic adept. He 
died in 1646.<ref target="RedAlch4.12" n="73">12</ref> 
 
</p><p><hi rend="italic">The New Chemical Light</hi> was held in great esteem by the

length of the generation of the metals and also of the Philosopher's 
Stone, and claims to be based on practical experience. The seed of 
Nature, we are told, is one, but various products result on account of 
the different conditions of development. An imaginary conversation 
between Mercury, an Alchemist and Nature which is appended, is not 
without a touch of humour. Says the Alchemist, in despair, "Now I see 
that I know nothing; only I must not say so.  For I should lose the good 
opinion of my neighbours, and they would no longer entrust me with money 
for my experiments. I must therefore go on saying that I know 
everything; for there are many that expect me to do great things for 
them.... There are many countries, and many greedy persons who will 
suffer themselves to be gulfed by my promises of mountains of gold. Thus 
day will follow day, and in the meantime the King or the donkey will

Art. He took a prominent part in the famous Rosicrucian controversy (see 
&sect; 49), defending the claims of the alleged society in several 
tracts. He is said, on the one hand, to have been admitted as a member 
of the fraternity; and on the other hand, to have himself founded a 
similar institution. A full account of his views will be found in the 
Rev. J. B. Craven's <hi rend="italic">Count Michael Maier: Life and Writings</hi> 
(1910).  He was a very learned man, but his works are somewhat obscure 
and abound in fanciful allegories. He read an alchemistic meaning into 
the ancient fables concerning the Egyptian and Greek gods and heroes. 
Like most alchemists, he held the supposed virtues of mercury in high 
esteem. In his <hi rend="italic">Lusus Serius: or, Serious Passe-time</hi>, for example, 
he supposes a Parliament of the various creatures of the world to meet, 
in order that Man might choose the noblest of them as king over all the 
rest. The calf, the sheep, the goose, the oyster, the bee, the silkworm, 
flax and mercury are the chosen representatives, each of which 
discourses in turn. It will be unnecessary to state that Mercury wins 
the day. Thus does Maier eulogise it: "Thou art the miracle, splendour 
and light of the world. Thou art the glory, ornament, and supporter of 
the Earth. Thou art the Asyle, Anchor, and tye of the Universe. Next to 
the minde of Man, God Created nothing more Noble, more Glorious, or more

<p><hi rend="bold">Jacob Boehme</hi>, or Behmen (see plate 11), was born at Alt 
Seidenberg, a village near G&ouml;rlitz, in 1575. His parents being 
poor, the education he received was of a very rudimentary nature, and 
when his schooling days were over, Jacob was apprenticed to a shoemaker. 
His religious nature caused him often to admonish his 
fellow-apprentices, which behaviour ultimately caused him to be 
dismissed. He travelled about as a journeyman shoemaker, returning, 
however, to G&ouml;rlitz in 1594, where he married and settled in 
business. He claims to have experienced a wonderful vision in 1598, and 
to have had a similar vision two years later. In these visions, the 
first of which lasted for several days, he believed that he saw into the 
inmost secrets of nature; but what at first appeared dim and vague 
became clear and coherent in a third vision, which he tells us was 
vouchsafed to him in 1610. It was then that he wrote his first book, the 
<hi rend="italic">Aurora</hi>, which he composed for himself only, in order that he 
should not forget the mysteries disclosed to him. At a later period he 
produced a large number of treatises of a mystical-religious nature, 
having spent the intervening years in improving his early education. 
These books aroused the ire of the narrow-minded ecclesiastical 
authorities of the town, and Jacob suffered considerable persecution in 
consequence. He visited Dresden in 1694, and in the same year was there 
taken ill with a fever. Returning to G&ouml;rlitz, he expired in a 
condition of ecstasy.

<pb n="75"/>  
 
</p><p>Jacob Boehme was an alchemist of a purely transcendental order. 
He had, it appears, acquired some knowledge of Chemistry during his 
apprentice days, and he employed the language of Alchemy in the 
elaboration of his system of mystical philosophy.  With this lofty 
mystical-religious system we cannot here deal; Boehme is, indeed, often 
accounted the greatest of true Christian mystics; but although conscious 
of his superiority over many minor lights, we think this title is due to 
Emanuel Swedenborg. The question of the validity of his visions is also 
one which lies beyond the scope of the present work; 
<ref target="RedAlch4.15" n="76">15</ref> we must confine our attention to Boehme 
as an alchemist. The Philosopher's Stone, in Boehme's terminology, is 
the Spirit of Christ which must "tincture" the individual soul. In one 
place he says, "The <hi rend="italic">Phylosopher's Stone</hi> is a very dark 
disesteemed Stone, of a <hi rend="italic">Gray</hi> colour, but therein lyeth the 
highest Tincture."<ref target="RedAlch4.16" n="77">16</ref> In the 
transcendental sense, this is reminiscent of the words of Isaiah: "He 
hath no form nor comeliness; and when we see him, there is no beauty 
that we should desire him. . . He was despised and we esteemed him not,"

in 1577. He devoted himself to the study of medicine, at first following 
Galen, but 
 
<pb n="76"/>  
 
afterwards accepting in part the teachings of Paracelsus; and he helped 
to a large extent in the overthrow of the old medical doctrines. His 
purely chemical researches were also of great value to the science. He 
was a man of profound knowledge, of a religious temperament, and he 
possessed a marked liking for the mystical. He was inspired by the 
writings of Thomas &agrave; Kempis to imitate Christ in all things, and 
he practised medicine, therefore, as a work of benevolence, asking no 
fee for his services. At the same time, moreover, he was a firm believer 
in the powers of the Philosopher's Stone, claiming to have himself 
successfully performed the transmutation of the metals on more than one 
occasion, though unacquainted with the composition of the medicine 
employed (see &sect; 62). Many of his theoretical views are highly 
fantastical. He lived a life devoted to scientific research, and died in 
1644. 
 
</p><p>Van Helmont regarded water as the primary element out of which 
all things are produced. He denied that fire was an element or anything 
material at all, and he did not accept the sulphur-mercury-salt theory. 
To him is due the word "gas"&mdash;before his time various gases were looked 
upon as mere varieties of air&mdash;and he also made a distinction between 
gases (which could not be condensed)<ref target="RedAlch4.18" n="79">18</ref>

investigated the gas that is now known as carbon-dioxide (carbonic

<head>&sect; 59. Thomas Vaughan (Eugenius Philalethes).</head> 
 
<p><hi rend="bold">Thomas Vaughan</hi>, who wrote under the name of <hi rend="bold">"Eugenius 
Philalethes</hi>," was born at Newton in Brecknockshire in 1622. He was 
educated at Jesus College, Oxford, graduating as a Bachelor of Arts, and 
being made a fellow of his college. He appears also to have taken holy 
orders and to have had the living of St.  Bridget's (Brecknockshire) 
conferred on him.<ref target="RedAlch4.19" n="80">19</ref> 
 
<pb n="78"/>  
 
During the civil wars he bore arms for the king, but his allegiance to 
the Royalist cause led to his being accused of "drunkenness, swearing, 
incontinency and bearing arms for the King"; and he appears to have been 
deprived of his living. He retired to Oxford and gave himself up to 
study and chemical research. He is to be regarded as an alchemist of the 
transcendental order. His views as to the nature of the true 
Philosopher's Stone may be gathered from the following quotation: "This, 
reader," he says, speaking of the mystical illumination, "is the 
Christian Philosopher's Stone, a Stone so often inculcated in Scripture. 
This is the Rock in the wildernesse, because in great obscurity, and few 
there are that know the right way unto it. This is the Stone of Fire in 
Ezekiel; this is the Stone with Seven Eyes upon it in Zacharie, and this 
is the White Stone with the New Name in the Revelation. But in the 
Gospel, where Christ himself speakes, who was born to discover mysteries 
and communicate Heaven to Earth, it is more clearly described." 
<ref target="RedAlch4.20" n="81">20</ref> At the same time he appears to have 
carried out experiments in physical Alchemy, and is said to have met 
with his death in 1666 through accidentally inhaling the fumes of some 
mercury with which he was experimenting. 
 
</p><p>Thomas Vaughan was an ardent disciple of Cornelius Agrippa, the 
sixteenth-century theosophist.  He held the peripatetic philosophy in 
very slight esteem. He was a man devoted to God, though probably guilty 
of some youthful follies, full of love 
 
<pb n="79"/>  
 
towards his wife, and with an intense desire for the solution of the 
great problems of Nature. Amongst his chief works, which are by no means 
wanting in flashes of mystic wisdom, may be mentioned <hi rend="italic">Anthroposophia 
Theomagica, Anima Magica Abscondita</hi> (which were published together), 
and <hi rend="italic">Magia Adamica; or, the Antiquitie of Magic</hi>. With regard to 
his views as expressed in the first two of these books, a controversy 
ensued between Vaughan and Henry Moore, which was marked by considerable 
acrimony.</p>

  <head>&sect; 60. "Eirenaeus Philalthes" and George Starkey</head>
  
  <p>The use of the pseudonym "Philalethes" has not 
been confined to one alchemist. The cosmopolitan adept who wrote under 
the name of <hi rend="bold">"Eiren&aelig;us Philalethes</hi>," has been confused, on 
the one hand, with Thomas Vaughan, on the other hand with George Starkey 
(?-1665). He has also been identified with Dr. Robert Child (1613-1654); 
but his real identity remains shrouded in mystery. 
<ref target="RedAlch4.21" n="82">21</ref> <hi rend="bold">George Starkey</hi> (or Stirk), the son 
of George Stirk, minister of the Church of England in Bermuda, graduated 
at Harvard in 1646 and practised medicine in the United States of 
America from 1647 to 1650. In 1651 he came to England and practised 
medicine in London. He died of the plague in 1665. In 1654-5 he 
published <hi rend="italic">The</hi> 
 
<pb n="80"/>  
 
<hi rend="italic">Marrow of Alchemy</hi>, by "Eiren&aelig;us Philoponos Philalethes," 
which some think he had stolen from his Hermetic Master. Other works by 
"Eiren&aelig;us Philalethes" appeared after Starkey's death and became 
immensely popular. <hi rend="italic">The Open Entrance to the Closed Palace of the 
King</hi> (the most famous of these) and the <hi rend="italic">Three Treatises</hi> of 
the same author will be found in <hi rend="italic">The Hermetic Museum</hi>.  Some of 
his views have already been noted (see &sect;&sect; 1 and 22). On 
certain points he differed from the majority of the alchemists. He 
denied that fire was an element, and, also, that bodies are formed by 
mixture of the elements. According to him there is one principle in the 
metals, namely, mercury, which arises from the aqueous element, and is 
termed "metalically differentiated water, <hi rend="italic">i.e</hi>., it is water 
passed into that stage of development, in which it can no longer produce 
anything but mineral substances."<ref target="RedAlch4.22" n="83">22</ref> 
Philalethes's views as to "metallic seed" are also of considerable 
interest. Of the seed of gold, which he regarded as the seed, also, of 
all other metals, he says:  "The seed of animals and vegetables is 
something separate, and may be cut out, or otherwise separately 
exhibited; but metallic seed is diffused throughout the metal, and 
contained in all its smallest parts; neither can it be discerned from 
its body: its extraction is therefore a task which may well tax the 
ingenuity of the most experienced philosopher...."

THE OUTCOME OF ALCHEMY</head> 
 
<div2 type="section" n="61" id="d74"> 
<head>&sect; 61. Did the Alchemists achieve the "Magnum Opus"?.</head> 
 
<p>The alchemists were untiring in their search for the Stone of the 
Philosophers, and we may well ask whether they ever succeeded in 
effecting a real transmutation. That many <hi rend="italic">apparent</hi> transmutations 
occurred, the observers being either self-deceived by a superficial 
examination&mdash;certain alloys resemble the "noble metals"&mdash;or deliberately 
cheated by impostors, is of course undoubted.  But at the same time we 
must not assume that, because we know not the method now, real 
transmutations have never taken place. Modern research indicates that it 
may be possible to transmute other metals, such as lead or bismuth, into 
gold, and consequently we must admit the possibility that amongst the 
many experiments carried out, a real transmutation was effected. On the 
other hand, the method which is suggested by the recent researches in 
question could not have been known to the alchemists or accidentally 
employed by them; and, moreover, the quantity of gold which is hoped 
for, should such a method prove successful, is far below the smallest 
amount that would have been detected in 
 
<pb n="82"/>  
 
the days of Alchemy. But if there be one method whereby the metals may 
be transmuted, there may be other methods. And it is not altogether an 
easy task to explain away the testimony of eminent men such as were van 
Helmont and Helvetius.</p> 
</div2> 
 
<div2 type="section" n="62" id="d75"> 
<head>&sect; 62. The Testimony of van Helmont.</head> 
 
<p><hi rend="bold">John Baptist van Helmont</hi> (see &sect; 57), who was celebrated 
alike for his skill as a physician and chemist and for his nobility of 
character, testified in more than one place that he had himself carried 
out the transmutation of mercury into gold. But, as we have mentioned 
above, the composition of the Stone employed on these occasions was 
unknown to him. He says: " . . . For truly, I have divers times seen it 
[the Stone of the Philosophers], and handled it with my hands: but it 
was of colour, such as is in Saffron in its Powder, yet weighty, and 
shining like unto powdered Glass: There was once given unto me one 
fourth part of one Grain: But I call a Grain the six hundredth part of 
one Ounce: This quarter of one Grain therefore, being rouled up in 
Paper, I projected upon eight Ounces of Quick-silver made hot in a 
Crucible; and straightway all the Quick-silver, with a certain degree of 
Noise, stood still from flowing, and being congealed, setled like unto a 
yellow Lump: but after pouring it out, the Bellows blowing, there were 
found eight Ounces, and a little less than eleven Grains [eight Ounces 
less eleven Grains] of the purest Gold:  Therefore one only Grain of 
that Powder, had transchanged 19186 [19156] Parts of Quick-silver, equal 
to itself, into the best Gold."<ref target="RedAlch5.1" n="85">1</ref> 
 
<pb n="83"/>  
 
</p><p>And again: "I am constrained to believe that there is the Stone 
which makes Gold, and which makes Silver; because I have at distinct 
turns, made projection with my hand, of one grain of the Powder, upon 
some thousand grains of hot Quick-silver; and the buisiness{sic} 
succeeded in the Fire, even as Books do promise; a Circle of many People 
standing by, together with a tickling Admiration of us all....  He who 
first gave me the Gold-making Powder, had likewise also, at least as 
much of it, as might be sufficient for changing two hundred thousand 
Pounds of Gold: . . . For he gave me perhaps half a grain of that 
Powder, and nine ounces and three quarters of Quick-silver were thereby 
transchanged: But that Gold, a strange man [a stranger], being a Friend 
of one evenings acquaintance, gave me."<ref target="RedAlch5.2" n="86">2</ref></p> 
</div2> 
 
<div2 type="section" n="63" id="d76"> 
<head>&sect; 63. The Testimony of Helvetius.</head> 
 
<p><hi rend="bold">John Frederick Helvetius</hi> (see plate 13), an eminent doctor of 
medicine, and physician to the Prince of Orange, published at the Hague 
in 1667 the following remarkable account of a transmutation he claimed 
to have effected. Certain points of resemblance between this account and 
that of van Helmont (<hi rend="italic">e.g</hi>., in each case the Stone is described as 
a glassy substance of a pale yellow colour) are worth noticing: "On the 
27 December, 1666, in the forenoon, there came to my house a certain 
man, who was a complete stranger to me, but of an honest, grave 
countenance, and an authoritative 
 
<pb n="84"/>  
 
mien, clothed in a simple garb like that of a Memnonite . . . 
 
</p><p>"After we had exchanged salutations, he asked me whether he might 
have some conversation with me.  He wished to say something to me about 
the Pyrotechnic Art, as he had read one of my tracts (directed against 
the sympathetic Powder of Dr. Digby), in which I hinted a suspicion 
whether the Grand Arcanum of the Sages was not after all a gigantic 
hoax. He, therefore, took that opportunity of asking me whether I could 
not believe that such a grand mystery might exist in the nature of 
things, by means of which a physician could restore any patient whose 
vitals were not irreparably destroyed. I answered: `Such a Medicine 
would be a most desirable acquisition for any physician; nor can any man 
tell how many secrets there may be hidden in Nature; yet, though I have 
read much about the truth of this Art, it has never been my good fortune 
to meet with a real Master of the Alchemical Science.' I also enquired 
whether he was a medical man.... In reply, he ... described himself as a 
brassfounder.... After some further conversation, the Artist Elias (for 
it was he) thus addressed me: `Since you have read so much in the works 
of the Alchemists about this Stone, its substance, its colour, and its 
wonderful effects, may I be allowed the question, whether you have not 
yourself prepared it?' On my answering his question in the negative, he 
took out of his bag a cunningly-worked ivory box, in which there were 
three large pieces of a substance resembling glass, or pale sulphur, and 
informed me that here was enough of the Tincture for the production of 
20 tons of gold. When I

had held the precious treasure in my hand for a quarter of an hour 
(during which time I listened to a recital of its wonderful curative 
properties), I was compelled to restore it to its owner, which I could 
not help doing with a certain degree of reluctance. After thanking him 
for his kindness in shewing it to me, I then asked how it was that his 
Stone did not display that ruby colour, which I had been taught to 
regard as characteristic of the Philosopher's Stone. He replied that the 
colour made no difference, and that the substance was sufficiently 
mature for all practical purposes. My request that he would give me a 
piece of his Stone (though it were no larger than a coriander seed), he 
somewhat brusquely refused, adding, in a milder tone, that he could not 
give it me for all the wealth I possessed, and that not on account of 
its great preciousness, but for some other reason which it was not 
lawful for him to divulge; . . .</p> 
</div2> 
 
<div2 type="section" n="64" id="d77"> 
<head>&sect; 64. Helvetius obtains the Philosopher's Stone.</head> 
 
<p>"When my strange visitor had concluded his narrative, I besought him to 
give me a proof of his assertion, by performing the transmutatory 
operation on some metals in my presence. He answered evasively, that he 
could not do so then, but that he would return in three weeks, and that, 
if he was then at liberty to do so, he would shew me something that 
would make me open my eyes. He appeared punctually to the promised day, 
and invited me to take a walk with him, in the course of which we 
discoursed profoundly on the secrets of Nature in fire, though I noticed 
that my companion was very chary in imparting information about the 
Grand Arcanum. . . . At last I asked him point-blank to show me 
 
<pb n="86"/>  
 
the transmutation of metals. I besought him to come and dine with me, 
and to spend the night at my house; I entreated; I expostulated; but in 
vain. He remained firm. I reminded him of his promise. He retorted that 
his promise had been conditional upon his being permitted to reveal the 
secret to me. At last, however, I prevailed upon him to give me a piece 
of his precious Stone&mdash;a piece no larger than a grain of rape seed. He 
delivered it to me as if it were the most princely donation in the 
world. Upon my uttering a doubt whether it would be sufficient to tinge 
more than four grains of lead, he eagerly demanded it back. I complied, 
in the hope that he would exchange it for a larger piece; instead of 
which he divided it in two with his thumb, threw away one-half and gave 
me back the other, saying: `Even now it is sufficient for you.' Then I 
was still more heavily disappointed, as I could not believe that 
anything could be done with so small a particle of the Medicine.  He, 
however, bade me take two drachms, or half an ounce of lead, or even a 
little more, and to melt it in the crucible; for the Medicine would 
certainly not tinge more of the base metal than it was sufficient for. 
I answered that I could not believe that so small a quantity of Tincture 
could transform so large a mass of lead. But I had to be satisfied with 
what he had given me, and my chief difficulty was about the application 
of the Tincture. I confessed that when I held his ivory box in my hand, 
I had managed to extract a few crumbs of his Stone, but that they had 
changed my lead, not into gold, but only into glass. He laughed, and 
said that I was more expert at theft than at the application of the 
Tincture. `You should 
 
<pb n="87"/>  
 
have protected your spoil with "yellow wax," then it would have been 
able to penetrate the lead and to transmute it into gold.' . . .</p> 
</div2> 
 
<div2 type="section" n="65" id="d78"> 
<head>&sect; 65. Helvetius performs a Transmutation.</head> 
 
<p>" . . . With . . . a promise to return at nine o'clock the next 
morning, he left me. But at the stated hour on the following day he did 
not make his appearance; in his stead, however, there came, a few hours 
later, a stranger, who told me that his friend the Artist was 
unavoidably detained, but that he would call at three o'clock in the 
afternoon. The afternoon came; I waited for him till half-past seven 
o'clock. He did not appear. Thereupon my wife came and tempted me to try 
the transmutation myself.  I determined, however, to wait till the 
morrow, and in the meantime, ordered my son to light the fire, as I was 
now almost sure that he was an impostor. On the morrow, however, I 
thought that I might at least make an experiment with the piece of 
`Tincture' which I had received; if it turned out a failure, in spite of 
my following his directions closely, I might then be quite certain that 
my visitor had been a mere pretender to a knowledge of this Art. So I 
asked my wife to put the Tincture in wax, and I myself, in the meantime, 
prepared six drachms of lead; I then cast the Tincture, enveloped as it 
was in wax, on the lead; as soon as it was melted, there was a hissing 
sound and a slight effervescence, and after a quarter of an hour I found 
that the whole mass of lead had been turned into the finest gold. Before 
this transmutation took place, the compound became intensely green, but 
as soon as I had poured it into the melting pot it assumed a hue like 
blood. When it cooled, it glittered 
 
<pb n="88"/>  
 
and shone like gold. We immediately took it to the goldsmith, who at 
once declared it to be the finest gold he had ever seen, and offered to 
pay fifty florins an ounce for it.</p> 
</div2> 
 
<div2 type="section" n="66" id="d79"> 
<head>&sect; 66. Helvetius's Gold Assayed.</head> 
 
<p>"The rumour, of course, spread at once like wildfire through the 
whole city; and in the afternoon, I had visits from many illustrious 
students of this Art; I also received a call from the Master of the Mint 
and some other gentlemen, who requested me to place at their disposal a 
small piece of the gold, in order that they might subject it to the 
usual tests. I consented, and we betook ourselves to the house of a 
certain silversmith, named Brechtil, who submitted a small piece of my 
gold to the test called `the fourth': three or four parts of silver are 
melted in the crucible with one part of gold, and then beaten out into 
thin plates, upon which some strong <hi rend="italic">aqua fortis</hi> [nitric acid] is 
poured. The usual result of this experiment is that the silver is 
dissolved, while the gold sinks to the bottom in the shape of a black 
powder, and after the <hi rend="italic">aqua fortis</hi> has been poured off, [the 
gold,] melted once again in the crucible, resumes its former shape.... 
When we now performed this experiment, we thought at first that one-half 
of the gold had evaporated; but afterwards we found that this was not 
the case, but that, on the contrary, two scruples of the silver had 
undergone a change into gold.</p> 
</div2> 
 
<div2 type="section" n="67" id="d80"> 
<head>&sect; 67. Helvetius's Gold Further Tested.</head> 
 
<p>"Then we tried another test, <hi rend="italic">viz</hi>., that which is performed by 
means of a septuple of Antimony; at first it seemed as if eight grains 
of the gold had been lost, but afterwards, not only had two scruples of 
the silver been converted into gold, but the silver itself 
 
<pb n="89"/>  
 
was greatly improved both in quality and malleability.  Thrice I 
performed this infallible test, discovering that every drachm of gold 
produced an increase of a scruple of gold, but the silver is excellent 
and extremely flexible.  Thus I have unfolded to you the whole story 
from beginning to end. The gold I still retain in my possession, but I 
cannot tell you what has become of the Artist Elias. Before he left me, 
on the last day of our friendly intercourse, he told me that he was on 
the point of undertaking a journey to the Holy Land. May the Holy Angels

<p>But even if the alchemists did not discover the Grand Arcanum of 
Nature, they did discover very many scientifically important facts. Even 
if they did not prepare the Philosopher's Stone, they did prepare a very 
large number of new and important chemical compounds.  Their labours 
were the seeds out of which modern Chemistry developed, and this highly 
important science is rightfully included under the expression "The 
Outcome of Alchemy." As we have already pointed out (&sect; 48), it was 
the iatro-chemists who first investigated chemical matters with an 
object other than alchemistic, 
 
<pb n="90"/>  
 
their especial end in view being the preparation of useful medicines, 
though the medical-chemist and the alchemist were very often united in 
the one person, as in the case of Paracelsus himself and the not less 
famous van Helmont. It was not until still later that Chemistry was 
recognised as a distinct science separate from medicine.</p> 
</div2> 
 
<div2 type="section" n="69" id="d82"> 
<head>&sect; 69. The Degeneracy of Alchemy.</head> 
 
<p>In another direction the Outcome of Alchemy was of a very distressing 
nature. Alchemy was in many respects eminently suitable as a cloak for 
fraud, and those who became "alchemists" with the sole object of 
accumulating much wealth in a short space of time, finding that the 
legitimate pursuit of the Art did not enable them to realise their 
expectations in this direction, availed themselves of this fact.  There 
is, indeed, some evidence that the degeneracy of Alchemy had commenced 
as early as the fourteenth century, but the attainment of the <hi rend="italic">magnum 
opus</hi> was regarded as possible for some three or more centuries. 
 
</p><p>The alchemistic promises of health, wealth and happiness and a 
pseudo-mystical style of language were effectively employed by these 
impostors. Some more or less ingenious tricks&mdash;such as the use of hollow 
stirring-rods, in which the gold was concealed, &amp;c.&mdash;convinced a 
credulous public of the validity of their claims. Of these 
pseudo-alchemists we have already made the acquaintance of Edward 
Kelley, but chief of them all is generally accounted the notorious 
"Count Cagliostro." That "Cagliostro" is rightfully placed in the 
category of pseudo-alchemists is certain, but it also appears equally 
certain that, charlatan though he was, posterity has not always done him 
 
<pb n="91"/>  
 
that justice which is due to all men, however bad they may be.</p> 
</div2> 
 
<div2 type="section" n="70" id="d83"> 
<head>&sect; 70. "Count Cagliostro".</head> 
 
<p>Of the birth and early life of the personage calling himself 
<hi rend="bold">"Count Cagliostro"</hi> nothing is known with any degree of certainty, 
even his true name being enveloped in mystery.  It has, indeed, been 
usual to identify him with the notorious Italian swindler, Giuseppe 
Balsamo, who, born at Palermo in 1743 (or 1748), apparently disappeared 
from mortal ken after some thirty years, of which the majority were 
spent in committing various crimes. "Cagliostro's" latest 
biographer,<ref target="RedAlch5.4" n="88">4</ref> who appears to have gone 
into the matter very thoroughly, however, throws very grave doubts on 
the truth of this theory. 
 
</p><p>If the earlier part of "Cagliostro's" life is unknown, the latter 
part is so overlaid with legends and lies, that it is almost impossible 
to get at the truth concerning it. In 1776 Cagliostro and his wife were 
in London, where "Cagliostro" became a Freemason, joining a lodge 
connected with "The Order of Strict Observance," a secret society 
incorporated with Freemasonry, 
 
<pb n="92"/>  
 
and which (on the Continent, at least) was concerned largely with occult 
subjects. "Cagliostro," however, was unsatisfied with its rituals and 
devised a new system which he called Egyptian Masonry. Egyptian Masonry, 
he taught, was to reform the whole world, and he set out, leaving 
England for the Continent, to convert Masons and others to his views. We 
must look for the motive power of his extraordinary career in vanity and 
a love of mystery-mongering, without any true knowledge of the occult; 
it is probable, indeed, that ultimately his unbounded vanity triumphed 
over his reason and that he actually believed in his own pretensions. 
That he did possess hypnotic and clairvoyant powers is, we think, at 
least probable; but it is none the less certain that, when such failed 
him, he had no scruples against employing other means of convincing the 
credulous of the validity of his claims. This was the case on his visit 
to Russia, which occurred not long afterwards. At St.  Petersburg a 
youthful medium he was employing, to put the matter briefly, "gave the 
show away," and at Warsaw, where he found it necessary to turn 
alchemist, he was detected in the process of introducing a piece of gold 
in the crucible containing the base metal he was about to "transmute." 
At Strasburg, which he reached in 1780, however, he was more successful. 
Here he appeared as a miraculous healer of all diseases, though whether 
his cures are to be ascribed to some simple but efficacious medicine 
which he had discovered, to hypnotism, to the power of the imagination 
on the part of his patients, or to the power of imagination on the part 
of those who have recorded the alleged cures, is a question into which 
we do not

propose to enter. At Strasburg "Cagliostro" came into contact with the 
Cardinal de Rohan, and a fast friendship sprang up between the two, 
which, in the end, proved "Cagliostro's" ruin. The "Count" next visited 
Bordeaux and Lyons, successfully founding lodges of Egyptian Masonry. 
From the latter town he proceeded to Paris, where he reached the height 
of his fame. He became extraordinarily rich, although he is said to have 
asked, and to have accepted, no fee for his services as a healer. On the 
other hand, there was a substantial entrance-fee to the mysteries of 
Egyptian Masonry, which, with its alchemistic promises of health and 
wealth, prospered exceedingly. At the summit of his career, however, 
fortune forsook him. As a friend of de Rohan, he was arrested in 
connection with the Diamond Necklace affair, on the word of the infamous 
Countess de Lamotte; although, of whatever else he may have been guilty, 
he was perfectly innocent of this charge. After lying imprisoned in the 
Bastille for several months, he was tried by the French Parliament, 
pronounced innocent, and released. Immediately, however, the king 
banished him, and he left Paris for London, where he seems to have been 
persistently persecuted by agents of the French king.  He returned to 
the Continent, ultimately reaching Italy, where he was arrested by the 
Inquisition and condemned to death on the charge of being a Freemason (a 
dire offence in the eyes of the Roman Catholic Church). The sentence, 
however, was modified to one of perpetual imprisonment, and he was 
confined in the Castle of San Leo, where he died in 1795, after four 
years of imprisonment, in what manner is not known.</p>

THE AGE OF MODERN CHEMISTRY</head> 
 
<div2 type="section" n="71" id="d85"> 
<head>&sect; 71. The Birth of Modern Chemistry.</head> 
 
<p>Chemistry as distinct from Alchemy and iatro-chemistry commenced with 
Robert Boyle (see plate 15), who first clearly recognised that its aim 
is neither the transmutation of the metals nor the preparation of 
medicines, but the observation and generalisation of a certain class of 
phenomena; who denied the validity of the alchemistic view of the 
constitution of matter, and enunciated the definition of an element 
which has since reigned supreme in Chemistry; and who enriched the 
science with observations of the utmost importance. Boyle, however, was 
a man whose ideas were in advance of his times, and intervening between 
the iatro-chemical period and the Age of Modern Chemistry proper came 
the period of the Phlogistic Theory&mdash;a theory which had a certain 
affinity with the ideas of the alchemists.</p> 
</div2> 
 
<div2 type="section" n="72" id="d86"> 
<head>&sect; 72. The Phlogiston Theory.</head> 
 
<p>The phlogiston theory was mainly due to Georg Ernst Stahl 
(1660-1734), Becher (1635-1682) had attempted to revive the once 
universally accepted sulphur-mercury-salt theory of the alchemists in a 
somewhat modified form, by the assumption that all substances consist of 
three earths&mdash;the

<pb n="95"/>  
 
combustible, mercurial, and vitreous; and herein is to be found the germ 
of Stahl's phlogistic theory.  According to Stahl, all combustible 
bodies (including those metals that change on heating) contain 
<hi rend="italic">phlogision</hi>, the principle of combustion, which escapes in the 
form of flame when such substances are burned. According to this theory, 
therefore, the metals are compounds, since they consist of a metallic 
calx (what we now call the "oxide" of the metal) combined with 
phlogiston; and, further, to obtain the metal from the calx it is only 
necessary to act upon it with some substance rich in phlogiston. Now, 
coal and charcoal are both almost completely combustible, leaving very 
little residue; hence, according to this theory, they must consist very 
largely of phlogiston; and, as a matter of fact, metals can be obtained 
by heating their calces with either of these substances. Many other 
facts of a like nature were explicable in terms of the phlogiston 
theory, and it became exceedingly popular. Chemists at this time did not 
pay much attention to the balance; it was observed, however, that metals 
increased in weight on calcination, but this was "explained" on the 
assumption that phlogiston possessed negative weight.  Antoine Lavoisier 
(1743-1794), utilising Priestley's discovery of oxygen (called 
"dephlogisticated air" by its discoverer) and studying the weight 
relations accompanying combustion, demonstrated the non-validity of the 
phlogistic theory<ref target="RedAlch6.1" n="89">1</ref> and proved 
combustion to be the combination of the substance burnt 
 
<pb n="96"/>  
 
with a certain constituent of the air, the oxygen. By this time Alchemy 
was to all intents and purposes defunct, Boerhave (1668-1738) was the 
last eminent chemist to give any support to its doctrines, and the new 
chemistry of Lavoisier gave it a final death-blow.  We now enter upon 
the Age of Modern Chemistry, but we shall deal in this chapter with the 
history of chemical theory only so far as is necessary in pursuance of 
our primary object, and hence our account will be very far from 
complete.</p>

<div2 type="section" n="73" id="d87"> 
<head>&sect; 73. Boyle and the Definition of an Element.</head> 
 
<p>Robert Boyle (1626-1691) had defined an element as a substance which 
could not be decomposed, but which could enter into combination with 
other elements giving compounds capable of decomposition into these 
original elements. Hence, the metals were classed among the elements, 
since they had defied all attempts to decompose them. Now, it must be 
noted that this definition is of a negative character, and, although it 
is convenient to term "elements" all substances which have so far defied 
decomposition, it is a matter of impossibility to decide what substances 
are true elements with absolute certainty; and the possibility, however 
faint, that gold and other metals are of a compound nature, and hence 
the possibility of preparing gold from the "base" metals or other 
substances, must always remain. This uncertainty regarding the elements 
appears to have generally been recognised by the new school of chemists, 
but this having been so, it is the more surprising that their criticism 
of alchemistic art was not less severe.</p>

<head>&sect; 74. The Stoichiometric Laws.</head> 
 
<p>With the study of the relative weights in 
 
<pb n="97"/>  
 
which substances combine, certain generalisations or "natural laws" of 
supreme importance were discovered.  These stoichiometric laws, as they 
are called, are as follows:&mdash;</p> 
 
<list type="simple"> 
 
<item>1. "The Law of Constant Proportion"&mdash;<hi rend="italic">The same chemical 
compound always contains the same elements, and there is a constant 
ratio between the weights of the constituent elements 
present</hi>.</item> 
 
<item>2. "The Law of Multiple Proportions"&mdash;<hi rend="italic">If two substances combine 
chemically in more than one proportion, the weights of the one which 
combine with a given weight of the other, stand in a simple rational 
ratio to one another</hi>.</item> 
 
<item>3. "The Law of Combining Weights"&mdash;<hi rend="italic">Substances combine either in 
the ratio of their combining numbers, or in simple rational multiples or 
submultiples of these numbers</hi>. (The weights of different substances 
which combine with a given weight of some particular substance, which is 
taken as the unit, are called the combining numbers of such substances 
with reference to this unit. The usual unit now chosen is 8 grammes of 
Oxygen.)<ref target="RedAlch6.2" n="90">2</ref></item> 
 
</list> 
 
<p>As examples of these laws we may take the few following simple 
facts:&mdash;</p> 
 
<pb n="98"/>  
 
<list type="simple"> 
 
<item>1. Pure water is found always to consist of oxygen and hydrogen 
combined in the ratio of 1.008 parts by weight of the latter to 8 parts 
by weight of the former; and pure sulphur-dioxide, to take another 
example, is found always to consist of sulphur and oxygen combined in 
the ratio of 8.02 parts by weight of sulphur to 8 parts by weight of 
oxygen. (The Law of Constant Proportion.)</item> 
 
<item>2. Another compound is known consisting only of oxygen and 
hydrogen, which, however, differs entirely in its properties from water. 
It is found always to consist of oxygen and hydrogen combined in the 
ratio of 1.008 parts by weight of the latter to 16 parts by weight of 
the former, <hi rend="italic">i.e</hi>., in it a definite weight of hydrogen is combined 
with an amount of oxygen <hi rend="italic">exactly twice</hi> that which is combined 
with the same weight of hydrogen in water. No definite compound has been 
discovered with a constitution intermediate between these two. Other 
compounds consisting only of sulphur and oxygen are also known. One of 
these (viz., sulphur-trioxide, or sulphuric anhydride) is found always 
to consist of sulphur and oxygen combined in the ratio of 5.35 parts by 
weight of sulphur to 8 parts by weight of oxygen. We see, therefore, 
that the weights of sulphur combined with a definite weight of oxygen in 
the two compounds called respectively "sulphur-dioxide" and 
"sulphur-trioxide," are in the proportion of 8.02 to 5.35, <hi rend="italic">i.e</hi>., 
3:2. Similar simple ratios are obtained in the case of all the other 
compounds. (The Law of Multiple Proportions.)</item> 
 
<item>3. From the data given in (1) above we can fix the combining 
number of hydrogen as 1.008, that of 
 
<pb n="99"/>  
 
sulphur as 8.02. Now, compounds are known containing sulphur and 
hydrogen, and, in each case, the weight of sulphur combined with 1.008 
grammes of hydrogen is found always to be either 8.02 grammes or some 
multiple or submultiple of this quantity.  Thus, in the simplest 
compound of this sort, containing only hydrogen and sulphur (viz., 
sulphuretted-hydrogen or hydrogen sulphide), 1.008 grammes of hydrogen 
is found always to be combined with 16.04 grammes of sulphur, 
<hi rend="italic">i.e</hi>., exactly twice the above quantity. (The Law of Combining 
Weights.)</item> 
</list> 
 
<p>Berthollet (1748-1822) denied the truth of the law of constant 
proportion, and a controversy ensued between this chemist and Proust 
(1755-1826), who undertook a research to settle the question, the 
results of which were in entire agreement with the law, and were 
regarded as completely substantiating it.</p>

<div2 type="section" n="75" id="d89"> 
<head>&sect; 75. Dalton's Atomic Theory.</head> 
 
<p>At the beginning of the nineteenth century, John Dalton (see plate 
15{sic should be 16}) put forward his Atomic Theory in explanation of 
these facts.  This theory assumes (1) that all matter is made up of 
small indivisible and indestructible particles, called "atoms"; (2) that 
all atoms are not alike, there being as many different sorts of atoms as 
there are elements; (3) that the atoms constituting any one element are 
exactly alike and are of definite weight; and (4) that compounds are 
produced by the combination of different atoms. Now, it is at once 
evident that if matter be so constituted, the stoichiometric laws must 
necessarily follow. For the smallest particle of any definite compound 
(now called a "molecule") must consist of a definite assemblage of 
different atoms, and these 
 
<pb n="100"/>  
 
atoms are of definite weight: whence the law of constant proportion. One 
atom of one substance may combine with 1, 2, 3 . . . atoms of some other 
substance, but it cannot combine with some fractional part of an atom, 
since the atoms are indivisible: whence the law of multiple proportions. 
And these laws holding good, and the atoms being of definite weight, the 
law of combining weights necessarily follows.  Dalton's Atomic Theory 
gave a simple and intelligible explanation of these remarkable facts 
regarding the weights of substances entering into chemical combination, 
and, therefore, gained universal acceptance. But throughout the history 
of Chemistry can be discerned a spirit of revolt against it as an 
explanation of the absolute constitution of matter. The tendency of 
scientific philosophy has always been towards Monism as opposed to 
Dualism, and here were not merely two eternals, but several dozen; 
Dalton's theory denied the unity of the Cosmos, it lacked the unifying 
principle of the alchemists. It is only in recent times that it has been 
recognised that a scientific hypothesis may be very useful without being 
altogether true.  As to the usefulness of Dalton's theory there can be 
no question; it has accomplished that which no other hypothesis could 
have done; it rendered the concepts of a chemical element, a chemical 
compound and a chemical reaction definite; and has, in a sense, led to 
the majority of the discoveries in the domain of Chemistry that have 
been made since its enunciation.  But as an expression of absolute 
truth, Dalton's theory, as is very generally recognised nowadays, fails 
to be satisfactory. In the past, however, it has been the philosophers 
of the materialistic school of thought,

<head>&sect; 76. The Determination of the Atomic Weights of the 
Elements.</head> 
 
<p>With the acceptance of Dalton's Atomic Theory, it became necessary to 
determine the atomic weights of the various elements, <hi rend="italic">i.e</hi>., not 
the absolute atomic weights, but the relative weights of the various 
atoms with reference to one of them as unit.<ref target="RedAlch6.4" n="92">4</ref> 
 
</p><p>We cannot in this place enter upon a 
discussion of the various difficulties, both of an experimental 
and theoretical nature, which were involved in 
this problem, save to remark that the correct atomic 
weights could be arrived at only with the acceptance 
of Avogadro's Hypothesis. This hypothesis, which is 
to the effect that equal volumes of different gases 
measured at the same temperature and pressure 
contain an equal number of gaseous molecules, was 
put forward in explanation of a number of facts 
connected with the physical behaviour of gases; but 
its importance was for some time unrecognised, owing 
to the fact that the distinction between atoms and 
molecules was not yet clearly drawn. A list of those 
chemical substances at present recognised as "elements," 
together with their atomic weights, will be 
found on pp. 106, 107.</p> 
</div2> 
 
<div2 type="section" n="77" id="d91"> 
<head>&sect; 77. Prout's Hypothesis.</head> 
 
<p>It was observed by a chemist of the name of Prout, that, the atomic 
weight of hydrogen being taken 
 
<pb n="103"/>  
 
as the unit, the atomic weights of nearly all the elements approximated 
to whole numbers; and in 1815 he suggested as the reason for this 
regularity, that all the elements consist solely of hydrogen. Prout's 
Hypothesis received on the whole a very favourable reception; it 
harmonised Dalton's Theory with the grand concept of the unity of 
matter&mdash;all matter was hydrogen in essence; and Thomas Thomson undertook 
a research to demonstrate its truth. On the other hand, however, the 
eminent Swedish chemist, Berzelius, who had carried out many atomic 
weight determinations, criticised both Prout's Hypothesis and Thomson's 
research (which latter, it is true, was worthless) in most severe terms; 
for the hypothesis amounted to this&mdash;that the decimals in the atomic 
weights obtained experimentally by Berzelius, after so much labour, were 
to be regarded as so many errors. In 1844, Marignac suggested half the 
hydrogen atom as the unit, for the element chlorine, with an atomic 
weight of 35.5, would not fit in with Prout's Hypothesis as originally 
formulated; and later, Dumas suggested one-quarter. With this 
theoretical division of the hydrogen-atom, the hypothesis lost its 
simplicity and charm, and was doomed to downfall. Recent and most 
accurate atomic weight determinations show clearly that the atomic 
weights are not exactly whole numbers, but that, nevertheless, the 
majority of them (if expressed in terms of O = 16 as the unit) do 
approximate very closely to such. The Hon. R. J. Strutt has recently 
calculated that the probability of this occurring, in the case of 
certain of the commoner elements, by mere chance is exceedingly small 
(about 1 in 
 
<pb n="104"/>  
 
1,000),<ref target="RedAlch6.5" n="93">5</ref> and several attempts to 
explain this remarkable fact have been put forward. Modern scientific 
speculations concerning the constitution of atoms tend towards a 
modified form of Prout's hypothesis, or to the view that the atoms of 
other elements are, in a manner, polymerides of hydrogen and helium 
atoms. As has been pointed out, it is possible, according to modern 
views, for elements of different atomic weight to have identical 
chemical properties, since these latter depend only upon the number of 
free electrons in the atom and not at all upon the massive central 
nucleus. By a method somewhat similar to that used for determining the 
mass of kathode particles (see &sect; 79), but applied to positively 
charged particles, Sir Joseph Thomson and Dr. F. W. Aston discovered 
that the element neon was a mixture of two isotopic elements in unequal 
proportions, one having an atomic mass of 20, the other (present only to 
a slight extent) having an atomic mass of 22. Dr. Aston has perfected 
this method of analysing mixtures of isotopes and determining their 
atomic masses.<ref target="RedAlch6.6" n="94">6</ref> The results are of 
great interest.  The atomic weight of hydrogen, 1.008, is confirmed. 
The elements helium, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, phosphorus, 
sulphur, arsenic, iodine and sodium are found to be simple bodies with 
whole-number atomic weights. On the other hand, boron, neon, silicon, 
chlorine, bromine, krypton, xenon, 
 
<pb n="105"/>  
 
mercury, lithium, potassium and rubidium are found to be mixtures. What 
is specially of interest is that the indicated atomic mass of each of 
the constituents is a whole number. Thus chlorine, whose atomic weight 
is 35.46, is found to be a mixture of two chemically-identical elements 
whose atomic weights are 35 and 37. Some of the elements, <hi rend="italic">e.g</hi>., 
xenon, are mixtures of more than two isotopes. 
 
</p><p>It is highly probable that what is true of the elements 
investigated by Dr. Aston is true of the remainder. It appears, 
therefore, that the irregularities presented by the atomic weights of 
the ordinary elements, which have so much puzzled men of science in the 
past, are due to the fact that these elements are, in many cases, 
mixtures.  As concerns hydrogen, it is only reasonable to suppose that 
the close packing of electrically charged particles should give rise to 
a slight decrease in their total mass, so that the atomic weights of 
other elements referred to H = 1 should be slightly less than whole

<p>There are several somewhat different forms of this Periodic Table. 
This is one of the simplest, but it lacks certain advantages of some of 
the more complicated forms. The atomic weights given are those of the 
International Atomic Weights Committee for 1920-1.  They are calculated 
on the basis. Oxygen = 16. The number of decimal places given in each 
case indicates the degree of accuracy with which each atomic weight has 
been determined. The letter or letters underneath the name of each 
element is the symbol by which it is invariably designated by chemists. 
 
</p><p>The number above each column indicates the valency which the 
elements of each group exhibit towards oxygen. Many of the elements are 
exceptional in this respect. 
 
</p><p>[a] The exact position of Hydrogen is in dispute. 
 
</p><p>[b] The positions of Argon and Potassium have been inverted in 
order that these elements may fall in the right columns with the 
elements they resemble; [d] 50 also have the positions of Tellurium and 
Iodine. 
 
</p><p>[c] The whole of "Group 8" forms an exception to the Table. 
 
</p><p>[e] There are a number of ill-defined rare earth metals with 
atomic weights lying between those of Cerium and Tantalum. They all 
appear to resemble the elements of "Group 3," so that their positions in 
the Table cannot be decided with accuracy.</p> 
 
 
<pb n="108"/>  
 
<p>resemble one another very closely, fall in Column 1; the "alkaline 
earth" metals occur together in Column 2; though in each case these are 
accompanied by certain elements with somewhat different properties. Much 
the same holds good in the case of the other columns of this Table; 
there is manifested a remarkable regularity, with certain still more 
remarkable divergences (see notes appended to Table on pp. 106, 107). 
This regularity exhibited by the "elements" is of considerable 
importance, since it shows that, in general, the properties of the 
"elements" are <hi rend="italic">periodic</hi> functions of their atomic weights; and, 
together with certain other remarkable properties of the "elements," 
distinguishes them sharply from the "compounds." It may be concluded 
with tolerable certainty, therefore, that if the "elements" are in 
reality of a compound nature, they are all, in general, compounds of a 
like nature distinct from that of other compounds. 
 
</p><p>It is now some years since the late Sir William Crookes attempted 
to explain the periodicity of the properties of the elements on the 
theory that they have all been evolved by a conglomerating process from 
some primal stuff&mdash;the protyle&mdash;consisting of very small particles. He 
represented the action of this generative cause by means of a "figure of 
eight" spiral, along which the elements are placed at regular intervals, 
so that similar elements come underneath one another, as in 
Mendel&eacute;eff's table, though the grouping differs in some respects. 
The slope of the curve is supposed to represent the decline of some 
factor (<hi rend="italic">e.g</hi>., temperature) conditioning the process, which 
process is assumed to be of a recurrent nature, like the swing of a 
pendulum After the completion of one swing 
 
<pb n="109"/>  
 
(to keep to the illustration of a pendulum) whereby one series of 
elements is produced, owing to the decline of the above-mentioned 
factor, the same series of elements is not again the result as would 
otherwise be the case, but a somewhat different series is produced, each 
member of which resembles the corresponding member of the former series. 
Thus, if the first series contains, for example, helium, lithium, 
carbon, &amp;c., the second series will contain instead, argon, potassium, 
titanium, &amp;c. The whole theory, though highly interesting, is, however, 
by no means free from defects.</p>

<head>&sect; 79. The Corpuscular Theory of Matter.</head> 
 
<p>We must now turn our attention to those recent views of the 
constitution of matter which originated to a great extent in the 
investigations of the passage of electricity through gases at very low 
pressures. It will be possible, however, on the present occasion, to 
give only the very briefest account of the subject; but a fuller 
treatment is rendered unnecessary by the fact that these and allied 
investigations and the theories to which they have given rise have been 
fully treated in several well-known works, by various authorities on 
the subject, which have appeared during the last few years. 
<ref target="RedAlch6.7" n="95">7</ref> 
 
 
</p><p>When an electrical discharge is passed through a high-vacuum 
tube, invisible rays are emitted from the kathode, generally with the 
production of a greenish-yellow 
 
<pb n="110"/>  
 
fluorescence where they strike the glass walls of the tube. These rays 
are called "kathode rays."  At one time they were regarded as waves in 
the ether, but it was shown by Sir William Crookes that they consist of 
small electrically charged particles, moving with a very high velocity. 
Sir J. J. Thomson was able to determine the ratio of the charge carried 
by these particles to their mass or inertia; he found that this ratio 
was constant whatever gas was contained in the vacuum tube, and much 
greater than the corresponding ratio for the hydrogen ion (electrically 
charged hydrogen atom) in electrolysis. By a skilful method, based on 
the fact discovered by Mr. C. T. R.  Wilson, that charged particles can 
serve as nuclei for the condensation of water-vapour, he was further 
able to determine the value of the electrical charge carried by these 
particles, which was found to be constant also, and equal to the charge 
carried by univalent ions, <hi rend="italic">e.g</hi>., hydrogen, in electrolysis. 
Hence, it follows that the mass of these kathode particles must be much 
smaller than the hydrogen ion, the actual ratio being about 1:1700. The 
first theory put forward by Sir J. J. Thomson in explanation of these 
facts, was that these kathode particles ("corpuscles" as he termed them) 
were electrically charged portions of matter, much smaller than the 
smallest atom; and since the same sort of corpuscle is obtained whatever 
gas is contained in the vacuum tube, it is reasonable to conclude that 
the corpuscle is the common unit of all matter.</p> 
</div2> 
 
<div2 type="section" n="80" id="d94"> 
<head>&sect; 80. Proof that the Electrons are not Matter.</head> 
 
<p>This eminent physicist, however, had shown mathematically that a 
charged particle moving with a very high velocity (approaching that of 
light) 
 
<pb n="111"/>  
 
would exhibit an appreciable increase in mass or inertia due to the 
charge, the magnitude of such inertia depending on the velocity of the 
particle. This was experimentally verified by Kaufmann, who determined 
the velocities, and the ratios between the electrical charge and the 
inertia, of various kathode particles and similar particles which are 
emitted by compounds of radium (see &sect;&sect; 89 and 90). Sir J. J. 
Thomson calculated these values on the assumption that the inertia of 
such particles is entirely of electrical origin, and thereby obtained 
values in remarkable agreement with the experimental. There is, 
therefore, no reason for supposing the corpuscle to be matter at all; 
indeed, if it were, the above agreement would not be obtained. As 
Professor Jones says:  "Since we know things only by their properties, 
and since all the properties of the corpuscle are accounted for by the 
electrical charge associated with it, why assume that the corpuscle 
contains anything but the electrical charge? It is obvious that there is 
no reason for doing so. 
 
</p><p><hi rend="italic">"The corpuscle is, then, nothing but a disembodied, electrical 
charge</hi>, containing nothing material, as we have been accustomed to 
use that term. It is electricity, and nothing but electricity. With this 
new conception a new term was introduced, and, now, instead of speaking 
of the corpuscle we speak of the <hi rend="italic">electron</hi>." 
<ref target="RedAlch6.8" n="96">8</ref> Applying this modification to the above 
view of the constitution of matter, we have what is called "the 
electronic theory," namely, that the 
 
<pb n="112"/>  
 
material atoms consist of electrons, or units of electricity in rapid 
motion; which amounts to this&mdash;that matter is simply an electrical 
phenomenon.</p> 
</div2> 
 
<div2 type="section" n="81" id="d95"> 
<head>&sect; 81. The Electronic Theory of Matter.</head> 
 
<p>Sir J. J. Thomson has elaborated this theory of the nature and 
constitution of matter; he has shown what systems of electrons would be 
stable, and has attempted to find therein the significance of 
Mendel&eacute;eff's generalisation and the explanation of valency. 
There can be no doubt that there is a considerable element of truth in 
the electronic theory of matter; the one characteristic property of 
matter, <hi rend="italic">i.e</hi>., inertia, can be accounted for electrically. The 
fundamental difficulty is that the electrons are units of negative 
electricity, whereas matter is electrically neutral. Several theories 
have been put forward to surmount this difficulty. Certainly the 
electron is a constituent of matter; but is it the sole constituent? 
Recent research indicates that, as already pointed out, all atoms 
consist of two distinct portions, a massive central nucleus, whose net 
charge is positive, surrounded by a number of electrons, just sufficient 
to neutralize this charge. The point of greatest interest is that the 
indicated number of free electrons is exactly the number which expresses 
the position of the element in the Periodic Table, reckoning helium as 
2, lithium as 3, and so on; and it would seem that the chemical 
properties of the elements are determined entirely by these electrons, 
and are, therefore, not, strictly speaking, periodic functions of their 
atomic weights, as was formerly thought (&sect; 78), but of their atomic 
numbers. The exact nature of the nuclei of the various atoms has yet to 
be 
 
<pb n="113"/>  
 
determined: in the case of the atoms heavier than helium they would 
appear to be made up of the nuclei of hydrogen and (or) helium atoms 
together with&mdash;in many cases&mdash;electrons insufficient in number to 
neutralize the positive charges associated with these.</p> 
</div2> 
 
<div2 type="section" n="82" id="d96"> 
<head>&sect; 82. The Etheric Theory of Matter.</head> 
 
<p>The analysis of matter has been carried a step further. A 
philosophical view of the Cosmos involves the assumption of an 
absolutely continuous and homogeneous medium filling all space, for an 
absolute vacuum is unthinkable, and if it were supposed that the stuff 
filling all space is of an atomic structure, the question arises, What 
occupies the interstices between its atoms? This ubiquitous medium is 
termed by the scientists of to-day "the Ether of Space." Moreover, such 
a medium as the Ether is demanded by the phenomena of light. It appears, 
however, that the ether of space has another and a still more important 
function than the transmission of light: the idea that matter has its 
explanation therein has been developed by Sir Oliver Lodge.  The 
evidence certainly points to the conclusion that matter is some sort of 
singularity in the ether, probably a stress centre. We have been too 
much accustomed to think of the ether as something excessively light and 
quite the reverse of massive or dense, in which it appears we have been 
wrong.  Sir Oliver Lodge calculates that the density of the ether is far 
greater than that of the most dense forms of matter; not that matter is 
to be thought of as a rarefaction of the ether, for the ether within 
matter is as dense as that without. What we call matter, however, is not 
a continuous substance; it consists, 
 
<pb n="114"/>  
 
rather, of a number of widely separated particles, whence its 
comparatively small density compared with the perfectly continuous 
ether. Further, if there is a difficulty in conceiving how a perfect 
fluid like the ether can give rise to a solid body possessed of such 
properties as rigidity, impenetrability and elasticity, we must remember 
that all these properties can be produced by means of motion. A jet of 
water moving with a sufficient velocity behaves like a rigid and 
impenetrable solid, whilst a revolving disc of paper exhibits elasticity 
and can act as a circular saw.<ref target="RedAlch6.10" n="97">10</ref> It 
appears, therefore, that the ancient doctrine of the alchemistic essence 
is fundamentally true after all, that out of the "One Thing" all 
material things have been produced by adaptation or modification; and, 
as we have already noticed (&sect; 60), there also appears to be some 
resemblance between the concept of the electron and that of the seed of 
gold, which seed, it should be borne in mind, was regarded by the 
alchemists as the common seed of all metals.</p> 
</div2> 
 
<div2 type="section" n="83" id="d97"> 
<head>&sect; 83. Further Evidence of the Complexity of the Atoms.</head> 
 
<p>There are also certain other facts which appear to demand such a 
modification of Dalton's Atomic Theory as is found in the Electronic 
Theory. One of the characteristics of the chemical elements is that each 
one gives a spectrum peculiar to itself. The spectrum of an element 
must, therefore, be due to its atoms, which in some way are able, at a 
sufficiently high temperature, to act upon the ether so as to produce 
vibrations of definite and characteristic wave-length. Now, in many 
cases the number of lines of definite wavelength 
 
<pb n="115"/>  
 
observed in such a spectrum is considerable, for example, hundreds of 
different lines have been observed in the arc-spectrum of iron. But it 
is incredible that an atom, if it were a simple unit, would give rise to 
such a number of different and definite vibrations, and the only 
reasonable conclusion is that the atoms must be complex in structure. We 
may here mention that spectroscopic examination of various heavenly 
bodies leads to the conclusion that there is some process of evolution 
at work building up complex elements from simpler ones, since the 
hottest nebul&aelig; appear to consist of but a few simple elements, 
whilst cooler bodies exhibit a greater complexity.</p> 
</div2> 
 
<div2 type="section" n="84" id="d98"> 
<head>&sect; 84. Views of Wald and Ostwald.</head> 
 
<p>Such modifications of the atomic theory as those we have briefly 
discussed above, although profoundly modifying, and, indeed, 
controverting the philosophical significance of Dalton's theory as 
originally formulated, leave its chemical significance practically 
unchanged. The atoms can be regarded no longer as the eternal, 
indissoluble gods of Nature that they were once supposed to be; thus, 
Materialism is deprived of what was thought to be its scientific 
basis.<ref target="RedAlch6.11" n="98">11</ref> But the science of Chemistry 
is unaffected thereby; the atoms are not the ultimate units out of which 
material things are built, but the atoms cannot be decomposed by purely 
chemical means; the "elements" are not truly elemental, but <hi rend="italic">they are 
chemical elements</hi>. However, the atomic theory has been subjected to 
a far more searching criticism.  Wald argues that substances obey the 
law of definite 
 
<pb n="116"/>  
 
proportions because of the way in which they are prepared; chemists 
refuse, he says, to admit any substance as a definite chemical compound 
unless it does obey this law. Wald's opinions have been supported by 
Professor Ostwald, who has attempted to deduce the other stoichiometric 
laws on these grounds without assuming any atomic hypothesis<ref target="RedAlch6.12" n="99">12</ref>; but these new ideas do not appear to 
have gained the approval of chemists in general. It is not to be 
supposed that chemists will give up without a struggle a mental tool of 
such great utility as Dalton's theory, in spite of its defects, has 
proved itself to be. There does seem, however, to be logic in the 
arguments of Wald and Ostwald, but the trend of recent scientific theory 
and research does not appear to be in the direction of Wald's views. 
Certainly, however, it appears that, on the one hand, the atomic theory 
is not necessitated by the so-called "stoichiometric laws"; but, on the 
other hand, a molecular constitution of matter seems to be demanded by 
the phenomenon known as the "Brownian Movement," <hi rend="italic">i.e</hi>., the 
spontaneous, irregular and apparently perpetual movement of microscopic 
portions of solid matter when immersed in a liquid medium; such movement 
appearing to be explicable only as the result of the motion of the 
molecules of which the liquid in question is built up.<ref target="RedAlch6.13" n="100">13</ref></p> 
 
 
<note id="RedAlch6.1" n="89"><seg type="note-symbol">1.</seg><p> It should be noted, however, that if by the 
term "phlogiston" we were to understand energy and not some form of 
matter, most of the statements of the phlogistics would be true so far 
as they go.</p></note> 
 
<note id="RedAlch6.2" n="90"><seg type="note-symbol">2.</seg><p> In order that these laws may hold good, it is, 
of course, necessary that the substances are weighed under precisely 
similar conditions.  To state these laws in a more absolute form, we can 
replace the term "weight" by "mass," or in preference, "inertia"; for 
the inertial of bodies are proportional to their weights, providing that 
they are weighed under precisely similar conditions. For a discussion of 
the exact significance of these terms "mass" and "inertia," the reader 
is referred to the present writer's <hi rend="italic">Matter, Spirit and the Cosmos</hi> 
(Rider, 1910), Chapter I., "On the Doctrine of the Indestructibility of 
Matter."</p></note> 
 
<note id="RedAlch6.3" n="91"><seg type="note-symbol">3.</seg><p> The term "valency" is not altogether an easy 
one to define; we will, however, here do our best to make plain its 
significance.  In a definite chemical compound we must assume that the 
atoms constituting each molecule are in some way bound together (though 
not, of course, rigidly), and we may speak of "bonds" or "links of 
affinity," taking care, however, not to interpret such terms too 
literally. Now, the number of "affinity links" which one atom can exert 
is not unlimited; indeed, according to the valency theory as first 
formulated, it is fixed and constant. It is this number which is called 
the "valency" of the element; but it is now known that the "valency" in 
most cases can vary between certain limits. Hydrogen, however, appears 
to be invariably univalent, and is therefore taken as the unit of 
valency. Thus, Carbon is quadrivalent in the methane-molecule, which 
consists of one atom of carbon combined with four atoms of hydrogen; and 
Oxygen is divalent in the water-molecule, which consists of one atom of 
oxygen combined with two atoms of hydrogen. Hence, we should expect to 
find one atom of carbon combining with two of oxygen, which is the case 
in the carbon-dioxide&mdash;(carbonic anhydride)&mdash;molecule. For a development 
of the thesis, so far as the compounds of carbon are concerned, that 
each specific "affinity link" corresponds in general to a definite and 
constant amount of energy, which is evolved as heat on disruption of the 
bond, the reader is referred to the present writer's monograph <hi rend="italic">On the 
Calculation of Thermo-Chemical Constants</hi> (Arnold, 1909). The 
phenomena of valency find their explanation in modern views concerning 
the constitution of atoms (see &sect; 81).</p></note> 
 
<note id="RedAlch6.4" n="92"><seg type="note-symbol">4.</seg><p> Since hydrogen is the lightest of all known 
substances, the unit, Hydrogen = 1, was at one time usually employed. 
However, it was seen to be more convenient to express the atomic weights 
in terms of the weight of the oxygen-atom, and the unit, Oxygen = 16 is 
now always employed. This value for the oxygen-atom was chosen so that 
the approximate atomic weights would in most cases remain unaltered by 
the change.</p></note>

<p>Correctly speaking, there is no such thing as "Modern Alchemy"; not 
that Mysticism is dead, or that men no longer seek to apply the 
principles of Mysticism to phenomena on the physical plane, but they do 
so after another manner from that of the alchemists. A new science, 
however, is born amongst us, closely related on the one hand to 
Chemistry, on the other to Physics, but dealing with changes more 
profound and reactions more deeply seated than are dealt with by either 
of these; a science as yet without a name, unless it be the not 
altogether satisfactory one of "Radioactivity." It is this science, or, 
perhaps we should say, a certain aspect of it, to which we refer (it may 
be fantastically) by the expression "Modern Alchemy": the aptness of the 
title we hope to make plain in the course of the present chapter.</p>

<head>&sect; 86. X-Ray's and Becquerel rays.</head> 
 
<p>As is commonly known, what are called X-rays are produced when an 
electric discharge is passed through a high-vacuum tube. It has been 
shown that these rays are a series of irregular pulses in the ether, 
which are set up when the kathode particles strike the walls of the 
glass vacuum 
 
<pb n="118"/>  
 
tube,<ref target="RedAlch7.1" n="101">1</ref> and it was found that more 
powerful effects can be produced by inserting a disc of platinum in the 
path of the kathode particles. It was M. Becquerel who first discovered 
that there are substances which naturally emit radiations similar to 
X-rays. He found that uranium compounds affected a photographic plate 
from which they were carefully screened, and he also showed that these 
uranium radiations, or "Becquerel rays," resemble X-rays in other 
particulars.  It was already known that certain substances fluoresce 
(emit light) in the dark after having been exposed to sunlight, and it 
was thought at first that the above phenomenon exhibited by uranium 
salts was of a like nature, since certain uranium salts are fluorescent; 
but M. Becquerel found that uranium salts which had never been exposed 
to sunlight were still capable of affecting a photographic plate, and 
that this remarkable property was possessed by all uranium salts, 
whether fluorescent or not. This phenomenon is known as "radioactivity," 
and bodies which exhibit it are said to be "radioactive." Schmidt found 
that thorium compounds possess a similar property, and Professor 
Rutherford showed that thorium compounds evolved also something 
resembling a gas.  He called this an "emanation."</p>

<head>&sect; 87. The Discovery of Radium.</head> 
 
<p>Mme. Curie<ref target="RedAlch7.2" n="102">2</ref> determined the 
radioactivity of many uranium and thorium compounds, and found that 
there was a proportion between the radioactivity 
 
<pb n="119"/>  
 
of such compounds and the quantity of uranium or thorium in them, with 
the remarkable exception of certain natural ores, which had a 
radioactivity much in excess of the normal, and, indeed, in certain 
cases, much greater than pure uranium. In order to throw some light on 
this matter, Mme. Curie prepared one of these ores by a chemical process 
and found that it possessed a normal radioactivity. The only logical 
conclusion to be drawn from these facts was that the ores in question 
must contain some unknown, highly radioactive substance, and the Curies 
were able, after very considerable labour, to extract from pitchblende 
(the ore with the greatest radioactivity) minute quantities of the salts 
of two new elements&mdash;which they named "Polonium" and "Radium" 
respectively&mdash;both of which were extremely radioactive.

<head>&sect; 88. Chemical Properties of Radium.</head> 
 
<p>Radium is an element resembling calcium, strontium, and barium in 
chemical properties; its atomic weight was determined by Mme.  Curie, 
and found to be about 225, according to her first experiments; a 
redetermination gave a slightly higher value, which has been confirmed 
by a further investigation carried out by Sir T. E. Thorpe. 
<ref target="RedAlch7.3" n="103">3</ref> Radium gives a 
 
<pb n="120"/>  
 
characteristic spectrum, and is intensely radioactive.  It should be 
noted that up to the middle of the year 1910 the element radium itself 
had not been prepared; in all the experiments carried out radium salts 
were employed (<hi rend="italic">i.e</hi>., certain compounds of radium with other 
elements), generally radium chloride and radium bromide. In that year, 
however, Mme. Curie, in conjunction with M. Debierne, obtained the free 
metal. It is described as a white, shining metal resembling the other 
alkaline earth metals. It reacts very violently with water, chars paper 
with which it is allowed to come in contact, and blackens in the air, 
probably owing to the formation of a nitride. It fuses at 700&deg; C., 
and is more volatile than barium.<ref target="RedAlch7.4" n="104">4</ref></p> 
</div2> 
 
<div2 type="section" n="89" id="d104"> 
<head>&sect; 89. The Radioactivity of Radium.</head> 
 
<p>Radium salts give off three distinct sorts of rays, referred to by 
the Greek letters &agr;, &bgr;, &ggr;. The &agr;-rays have been shown to 
consist of of electrically charged (positive) particles, with a mass 
approximately equal to that of four hydrogen atoms; they are slightly 
deviated by a magnetic field, and do not possess great penetrative 
power. The &bgr;-rays are similar to the kathode rays, and consist of 
(negative) electrons; they are strongly deviated by a magnetic field, in 
a direction opposite to that in which the &agr;-particles are deviated, 
and possess medium penetrative power, passing for the most part through 
a thin sheet of metal. The &ggr;-rays resemble X-rays; they possess 
 
<pb n="121"/>  
 
great penetrative power, and are not deviated by a magnetic field. The 
difference in the effect of the magnetic field on these rays, and the 
difference in their penetrative power, led to their detection and allows 
of their separate examination. Radium salts emit also an emanation, 
which tends to become occluded in the solid salt, but can be 
conveniently liberated by dissolving the salt in water, or by heating 
it. The emanation exhibits the characteristic properties of a gas, it 
obeys Boyle's Law (<hi rend="italic">i.e</hi>., its volume varies inversely with its 
pressure), and it can be condensed to a liquid at low temperatures; its 
density as determined by the diffusion method is about 100. Attempts to 
prepare chemical compounds of the emanation have failed, and in this 
respect it resembles the rare gases of the atmosphere&mdash;helium, neon, 
argon, krypton, and xenon&mdash;whence it is probable that its molecules are 
monatomic, so that a density of 100 would give its atomic weight as 
200.<ref target="RedAlch7.5" n="105">5</ref> As can be seen from the table on 
pp. 106, 107, an atomic weight of about 220 corresponds to a position in 
the column containing the rare gases in the periodic system. That the 
emanation actually has an atomic weight of these dimensions was 
confirmed by further experiments carried out by the late Sir William 
Ramsay and Dr. R. W. Gray.<ref target="RedAlch7.6" n="106">6</ref> These 
chemists determined the density of the emanation by actually weighing 
minute quantities of known volume of the substance, sealed up in small 
capillary tubes, a specially sensitive 
 
<pb n="122"/>  
 
balance being employed. Values for the density varying from 108 to 
113&frac12;, corresponding to values for the atomic weight varying from 
216 to 227, were thereby: obtained. Sir William Ramsay, therefore, 
considered that there could no longer be any doubt that the emanation 
was one of the elements of the group of chemically inert gases. He 
proposed to call it <hi rend="italic">Niton</hi>, and, for reasons which we shall note 
later, considered that in all probability it had an atomic weight of 
about 222&frac12;.</p> 
</div2> 
 
<div2 type="section" n="90" id="d105"> 
<head>&sect; 90. The Disintegration of the Radium Atom.</head> 
 
<p>Radium salts possess another very remarkable property, namely, that 
of continuously emitting light and heat. It seemed, at first, that here 
was a startling contradiction to the law of the conservation of energy, 
but the whole mystery becomes comparatively clear in terms of the 
corpuscular or the electronic theory of matter. The radium-atom is a 
system of a large number (see &sect; 81) of corpuscles or electrons, and 
contains in virtue of their motion an enormous amount of energy.  But it 
is known from Chemistry that atomic systems (<hi rend="italic">i.e</hi>., molecules) 
which contain very much energy are unstable and liable to explode. The 
same law holds good on the more interior plane&mdash;the radium-atom is 
liable to, and actually does, explode. And the result?  Energy is set 
free, and manifests itself partly as heat and light. Some free electrons 
are shot off (the &bgr;-rays), which, striking the undecomposed 
particles of salt, give rise to pulses in the ether (the 
&ggr;-rays),<ref target="RedAlch7.7" n="107">7</ref> just as the kathode 
particles give rise to X-rays when they 
 
<pb n="123"/>  
 
strike the walls of the vacuum tube or a platinum disc placed in their 
path. The &bgr; and &ggr;-rays do not, however, result immediately from 
the exploding radium-atoms, the initial products being the emanation 
and one &agr;-particle from each radium-atom destroyed.</p> 
</div2> 
 
<div2 type="section" n="91" id="d106"> 
<head>&sect; 91. Induced Radioactivity.</head> 
 
<p>Radium salts have the property of causing surrounding objects to 
become temporally radioactive.  This "induced radioactivity," as it may 
be called, is found to be due to the emanation, which is itself 
radioactive (it emits &agr;-rays only), and is decomposed into minute 
traces of solid radioactive deposits. By examining the rate of decay of 
the activity of the deposit, it has been found that it is undergoing a 
series of sub-atomic changes, the products being termed Radium A, B, C, 
&amp;c. It has been proved that all the &bgr; and &ggr;-rays emitted by 
radium salts are really due to certain of these secondary products. 
Radium F is thought to be identical with Polonium (&sect; 87). Another 
product is also obtained by these decompositions, with which we shall 
deal later (&sect; 94).</p> 
</div2> 
 
<div2 type="section" n="92" id="d107"> 
<head>&sect; 92. Properties of Uranium and Thorium.</head> 
 
<p>Uranium and thorium differ in one important respect from radium, 
inasmuch as the first product of the decomposition of the uranium and 
thorium atoms is in both cases solid.  Sir William Crookes<ref target="RedAlch7.8" n="108">8</ref> was able to separate from uranium salts by 
chemical means a small quantity of an intensely radioactive substance, 
which he called Uranium X, the residual uranium having lost most of its 
activity; and M. 
 
<pb n="124"/>  
 
Becquerel, on repeating the experiment, found that the activity of the 
residual uranium was slowly regained, whilst that of the uranium X 
decayed. This is most simply explained by the theory that uranium first 
changes into uranium X. It has been suggested that radium may be the 
final product of the breaking up of the uranium-atom; at any rate, it is 
quite certain that radium must be evolved in some way, as otherwise 
there would be none in existence&mdash;it would all have decomposed. This 
suggestion has been experimentally confirmed, the growth of radium in 
large quantities of a solution of purified uranyl nitrate having been 
observed. Uranium gives no emanation.  Thorium probably gives at least 
three solid products&mdash;Meso-thorium, Radio-thorium, and Thorium X, the 
last of which yields an emanation resembling that obtained from radium, 
but not identical with it.</p> 
</div2> 
 
<div2 type="section" n="93" id="d108"> 
<head>&sect; 93. The Radium Emanation.</head> 
 
<p>We must now more fully consider the radium emanation&mdash;a substance 
with more astounding properties than even the radium compounds 
themselves. By distilling off the emanation from some radium bromide, 
and measuring the quantities of heat given off by the emanation and the 
radium salt respectively, Professors Rutherford and Barnes 
<ref target="RedAlch7.9" n="109">9</ref> proved that nearly three-fourths of the 
total amount of heat given out by a radium salt comes from the minute 
quantity of emanation that it contains. The amount of energy liberated 
as heat during the decay of the emanation is enormous; one cubic 
centimetre liberates about four 
 
<pb n="125"/>  
 
million times as much heat as is obtained by the combustion of an equal 
volume of hydrogen. Undoubtedly this must indicate some profound change, 
and one may well ask, What is the ultimate product of the decomposition 
of the emanation?</p> 
</div2> 
 
<div2 type="section" n="94" id="d109"> 
<head>&sect; 94. The Production of Helium from Radium.</head> 
 
<p>It had been observed already that the radioactive minerals on heating 
give off Helium&mdash;a gaseous element, characterised by a particular yellow 
line in its spectrum&mdash;and it seemed not unlikely that helium might be 
the ultimate decomposition product of the emanation. A research to 
settle this point was undertaken by Sir William Ramsay and Mr. 
Soddy,<ref target="RedAlch7.10" n="110">10</ref> and a preliminary experiment 
having confirmed the above speculation, they carried out further very 
careful experiments. "The maximum amount of the emanation obtained from 
50 milligrams of radium bromide was conveyed by means of oxygen into a 
<hi rend="bold">U</hi>-tube cooled in liquid air, and the latter was then extracted by 
the pump."  The spectrum was observed; it "was apparently a new one, 
probably that of the emanation itself.... After standing from July 17 to 
21 the helium spectrum appeared, and the characteristic lines were 
observed."  Sir William Ramsay performed a further experiment with a 
similar result, in which the radium salt had been first of all heated in 
a vacuum for some time, proving that the helium obtained could not have 
been occluded in it; though the fact that the helium spectrum did not 
immediately appear, in itself 
 
<pb n="126"/>  
 
proves this point. Sir William Ramsay's results were confirmed by 
further careful experiments by Sir James Dewar and other chemists. It 
was suggested, therefore, that the &agr;-particle consists of an 
electrically charged helium-atom, and not only is this view in agreement 
with the value of the mass of this particle as determined 
experimentally, but it has been completely demonstrated by Professor 
Rutherford and Mr.  Royds. These chemists performed an experiment in 
which the emanation from about one-seventh of a gramme of radium was 
enclosed in a thin-walled tube, through the walls of which the 
&agr;-particles could pass, but which were impervious to gases. This 
tube was surrounded by an outer jacket, which was evacuated.  After a 
time the presence of helium in the space between the inner tube and the 
outer jacket was observed spectroscopically. 
<ref target="RedAlch7.11" n="111">11</ref> Now, the emanation-atom results from the 
radium-atom by the expulsion of one &agr;-particle; and since this 
latter consists of an electrically charged helium-atom, it follows that 
the emanation must have an atomic weight of 226-4, <hi rend="italic">i.e</hi>., 222. 
This value is in agreement with Sir William Ramsay's determination of 
the density of the emanation.  We may represent the degradation of the 
radium-atom, therefore, by the following scheme:&mdash;

<div2 type="section" n="95" id="d110"> 
<head>&sect; 95. Nature of this Change.</head> 
 
<p>Here, then, for the first time in the history of Chemistry, we have 
the undoubted formation of one chemical element from another, for, 
leaving out of the question the nature of the emanation, there can be no 
doubt that radium is a chemical element. This is a point which must be 
insisted upon, for it has been suggested that radium may be a compound 
of helium with some unknown element; or, perhaps, a compound of helium 
with lead, since it has been shown that lead is probably one of the end 
products of the decomposition of radium. The following considerations, 
however, show this view to be altogether untenable: (i.) All attempts to 
prepare compounds of helium with other elements have failed. (ii.) 
Radium possesses all the properties of a chemical element; it has a 
characteristic spectrum, and falls in that column in the Periodic Table 
with those elements which it resembles as to its chemical properties. 
(iii.) The quantity of heat liberated on the decomposition of the 
emanation is, as we have already indicated, out of all proportion to 
that obtained even in the most violent chemical reactions; and (iv.) one 
very important fact has been observed, namely, that the rate of decay of 
the emanation is unaffected by even extreme changes of temperature, 
whereas chemical actions are always affected in rate by changes of 
temperature. It will also be advisable, perhaps, to indicate some of the 
differences between helium and the emanation. The latter is a heavy gas, 
condensable to a liquid by liquid air (recently it has been 
solidified<ref target="RedAlch7.12" n="112">12</ref>); whereas helium 
 
<pb n="128"/>  
 
is the lightest of all known gases with the exception of hydrogen and 
has been liquefied only by the most persistent effort.   
<ref target="RedAlch7.13" n="113">13</ref> The emanation, moreover, is radioactive, 
giving off &agr;-particles, whereas helium does not possess this 
property.</p> 
</div2> 
 
<div2 type="section" n="96" id="d111"> 
<head>&sect; 96. Is this Change a true Transmutation?</head> 
 
<p>It has been pointed out, however, that (in a sense) this change 
(viz., of emanation into helium) is not quite what has been meant by the 
a expression "transmutation of the elements"; for the reason that it is 
a <hi rend="italic">spontaneous</hi> change; no effort of ours can bring it about or 
cause it to cease.<ref target="RedAlch7.14" n="114">14</ref> But the fact of 
the change does go to prove that the chemical elements are not the 
discrete units of matter that they were supposed to be. And since it 
appears that all matter is radioactive, although (save in these 
exceptional cases) in a very slight degree, 
<ref target="RedAlch7.15" n="115">15</ref> we here have evidence of a process of 
evolution at work among the chemical elements. The chemical elements are 
not permanent; they are all undergoing change; and the common elements 
merely mark those points where the rate of the evolutionary process is 
at its slowest. (See also &sect;&sect; 78 and 83.) Thus, the essential 
truth in the old alchemistic doctrine of the growth of metals is 
vindicated, for the metals do grow in the womb of Nature, although the 
process may be far 
 
<pb n="129"/>  
 
slower than appears to have been imagined by certain of the 
alchemists,<ref target="RedAlch7.16" n="116">16</ref> and although gold may 
not be the end product. As writes Professor Sir W. Tilden:  " . . . It 
appears that modern ideas as to the genesis of the elements, and hence 
of all matter, stand in strong contrast with those which chiefly 
prevailed among experimental philosophers from the time of Newton, and 
seem to reflect in an altered form the speculative views of the 
ancients." " . . . It seems probable," he adds, "that the chemical 
elements, and hence all material substances of which the earth, the sea, 
the air, and the host of heavenly bodies are all composed, resulted from 
a change, corresponding to condensation, in something of which we have 
no direct and intimate knowledge. Some have imagined this primal essence 
of all things to be identical with the ether of space. As yet we know 
nothing with certainty, but it is thought that by means of the 
spectroscope some stages of the operation may be seen in progress in the 
nebul&aelig; and stars...."<ref target="RedAlch7.17" n="117">17</ref> We have

<div2 type="section" n="97" id="d112"> 
<head>&sect; 97. The Production of Neon from Emanation.</head> 
 
<p>As we have already indicated above (&sect; 93), the radium emanation 
contains a vast store of potential energy, and it was with the idea of 
utilising this energy for bringing about chemical changes that Sir 
William Ramsay<ref target="RedAlch7.18" n="118">18</ref> undertook a research 
on the chemical action of this substance&mdash;a research with the most 
surprising and the most interesting results, for the energy contained 
within the radium emanation appeared to behave like a veritable 
Philosopher's Stone. The first experiments were carried out on distilled 
water. It had already been observed that the emanation decomposes water 
into its gaseous elements, oxygen and hydrogen, and that the latter is 
always produced in excess. These results were confirmed and the presence 
of hydrogen peroxide was detected, explaining the formation of an excess 
of hydrogen; it was also shown that the emanation brings about the 
reverse change to some extent, causing oxygen end hydrogen to unite with 
the production of water, until a position of equilibrium is 
 
<pb n="131"/>  
 
attained. On examining spectroscopically the gas obtained by the action 
of the emanation on water, after the removal of the ordinary gases, a 
most surprising result was observed&mdash;the gas showed a brilliant spectrum 
of neon, accompanied with some faint helium lines. A more careful 
experiment was carried out later by Sir William Ramsay and Mr. Cameron, 
in which a silica bulb was employed instead of glass.  The spectrum of 
the residual gas after removing ordinary gases was successfully 
photographed, and a large number of the neon lines identified; helium 
was also present. The presence of neon could not be explained, in 
Ramsay's opinion, by leakage of air into the apparatus, as the 
percentage of neon in the air is not sufficiently high, whereas this 
suggestion might be put forward in the case of argon. Moreover, the neon 
could not have come from the aluminium of the electrodes (in which it 
might be thought to have been occluded), as the sparking tube had been 
used and tested before the experiment was carried out. The authors 
conclude: "We must regard the transformation of emanation into neon, in 
presence of water, as indisputably proved, and, if a transmutation be 
defined as a transformation brought about at will, by change of 
conditions, then <hi rend="italic">this is the first case of transmutation of which 
conclusive evidence is put forward</hi>." 
<ref target="RedAlch7.19" n="119">19</ref> However, Professor Rutherford and Mr. 
Royds have been unable to confirm this result. They describe 
<ref target="RedAlch7.20" n="120">20</ref> attempts to obtain neon by the action of 
emanation 
 
<pb n="132"/>  
 
on water. Out of five experiments no neon was obtained, save in one case 
in which a small air leak was discovered; and, since the authors find 
that very minute quantities of this gas are sufficient to give a clearly 
visible spectrum, they conclude that Ramsay's positive results are due, 
after all, to leakage of air into the apparatus. But if this is the true 
explanation of Ramsay's results, it is difficult to understand why, in 
the case of the experiment with a solution of a copper salt described 
below, the presence of neon was not detected, for, if due to leakage, 
the proportions of the rare gases present should presumably have been 
the same in all the experiments. Further research seems necessary 
conclusively to settle the question.</p>

<div2 type="section" n="98" id="d113"> 
<head>&sect; 98. Ramsay's Experiments on Copper.</head> 
 
<p>The fact that an excess of hydrogen was produced when water was 
decomposed by the emanation suggested to Sir William Ramsay and Mr. 
Cameron that if a solution of a metallic salt was employed in place of 
pure water, the free metal might be obtained. These "modern alchemists," 
therefore, proceeded to investigate the action of radium emanation on 
solutions of copper and lead salts, and again apparently effected 
transmutations. They found on removing the copper from a solution of a 
copper-salt which had been subjected to the action of the emanation, and 
spectroscopically examining the residue, that a considerable quantity of 
sodium was present, together with traces of lithium; and the gas evolved 
in the case of a solution of copper nitrate contained, along with much 
nitric oxide and a little nitrogen, argon (which was detected 
spectroscopically), but no helium.  It certainly seemed like a dual 
transformation of 
 
<pb n="133"/>  
 
copper into lithium and sodium, and emanation into argon. They also 
observed that apparently carbon dioxide is continually evolved from an 
acid solution of thorium nitrate (see below, &sect; 100). It is worth 
while noticing that helium, neon and argon occur in the same column in 
the Periodic Table with emanation; lithium and sodium with copper, and 
carbon with thorium; in each case the elements produced being of lighter 
atomic weight than those decomposed.<ref target="RedAlch7.21" n="121">21</ref> 
The authors make the following suggestions: "(1) That helium and the 
&agr;-particle are not identical; (2) that helium results from the 
`degradation' of the large molecule of emanation by its bombardment with 
&agr;-particles; (3) that this `degradation,' when the emanation is 
alone or mixed with oxygen and hydrogen, results in the lowest member of 
the inactive series, namely, helium; (4) that if particles of greater 
mass than hydrogen or oxygen are associated with the emanation, namely, 
liquid water, then the `degradation' of the emanation is less complete, 
and neon is produced; (5) that when molecules of still greater weight 
and complexity are present, as is the case when the emanation is 
dissolved in a solution of copper sulphate, the product of `degradation' 
of the emanation is argon. We are inclined to believe too [they say] 
that (6) the copper also is involved in this process of degradation, and 
is reduced to the lowest term of its series, namely, lithium; and at the 
same time, inasmuch as the weight of the residue of alkali, produced 
when copper nitrate is present, is double that obtained from the blank 
experiment, or from water alone, the supposition is not excluded that 
the 
 
<pb n="134"/>  
 
chief product of the `degradation' of copper is sodium."

<p>A little later Madame Curie and Mademoiselle Gleditsch 
<ref target="RedAlch7.23" n="123">23</ref> repeated Cameron and Ramsay's experiments 
on copper salts, using, however, platinum apparatus. They failed to 
detect lithium after the action of the emanation, and think that Cameron 
and Ramsay's results may be due to the glass vessels employed. Dr. 
Perman<ref target="RedAlch7.24" n="124">24</ref> has investigated the direct 
action of the emanation on copper and gold, and has failed to detect any 
trace of lithium.  The transmutation of copper into lithium, therefore, 
must be regarded as unproved, but further research is necessary before 
any conclusive statements can be made on the subject.</p>

<head>&sect; 100. Ramsay's Experiments on Thorium and allied 
Metals.</head> 
 
<p>In his presidential address to the Chemical Society, 
March 25, 1909, after having brought forward some exceedingly 
interesting arguments for the possibility of transmutation, Sir William 
Ramsay described some experiments which he had carried out on 
 
<pb n="135"/>  
 
thorium and allied elements.<ref target="RedAlch7.25" n="125">25</ref> It was 
found, as we have already stated (&sect; 98), that, apparently, carbon-dioxide was continually evolved from an acid solution of thorium 
nitrate, precautions being taken that the gas was not produced from the 
grease on the stopcock employed, and it also appeared that carbon-dioxide was produced by the action of radium emanation on thorium 
nitrate. The action of radium emanation on compounds (not containing 
carbon) of other members of the carbon group, namely, silicon, zirconium 
and lead, was then investigated; in the cases of zirconium nitrate and 
hydrofluosilicic acid, carbon-dioxide was obtained; but in the case of 
lead chlorate the amount of carbon dioxide was quite insignificant. 
Curiously enough, the perchlorate of bismuth, a metal which belongs to 
the nitrogen group of elements, also yielded carbon-dioxide when acted 
on by emanation. Sir William Ramsay concludes his discussion of these 
experiments as follows: "Such are the facts. No one is better aware than 
I how insufficient the proof is. Many other experiments must be made 
before it can confidently be asserted that certain elements, when 
exposed to `concentrated energy,' undergo degradation into carbon." Some 
such confirmatory experiments were carried out by Sir William Ramsay and 
Mr. Francis L Usher, and they also described an experiment with a 
compound of titanium. Their results confirm Sir William Ramsay's former 
experiments.  Carbon-dioxide was obtained in appreciable quantities by 
the action of emanation on compounds 
 
<pb n="136"/>  
 
of silicon, titanium, zirconium and thorium.  In the case of lead, the 
amount of carbon dioxide obtained was inappreciable.

<head>&sect; 101. The Possibility of Making Gold</head> 
 
<p>It does not seem unlikely that if it is possible to "degrade" 
elements, it may be possible to build them up. It has been suggested 
that it might be possible to obtain, in this way, gold from silver, 
since these two elements occur in the same column in the Periodic Table; 
but the suggestion still awaits experimental confirmation. The question 
arises, What would be the result if gold could be cheaply produced? That 
gold is a metal admirably adapted for many purposes, for which its 
scarcity prevents its use, must be admitted. But the financial chaos 
which would follow if it were to be cheaply obtained surpasses the 
ordinary imagination. It is a theme that ought to appeal to a novelist 
of exceptional imaginative power. However, we need not fear these 
results, for not only is radium extremely rare, far dearer than gold, 
and on account of its instability will never be obtained in large 
quantities, but, judging from the above-described experiments, if, 
indeed, the radium emanation is the true Philosopher's Stone, the 
quantity of gold that may be hoped for by its aid is extremely 
small.</p>

<div2 type="section" n="102" id="d117"> 
<head>&sect; 102. The Significance of "Allotropy."</head> 
 
<p>A very suggestive argument for the transmutation of the metals was 
put forward by Professor Henry M. Howe, LL.D., in a paper entitled 
"Allotropy or Transmutation?" read before the British Association 
(Section B), Sheffield Meeting, 1910. 
 
<pb n="137"/>  
 
Certain substances are known which, although differing in their physical 
properties very markedly, behave chemically as if they were one and the 
same element, giving rise to the same series of compounds. Such 
substances, of which we may mention diamond, graphite and charcoal 
(<hi rend="italic">e.g</hi>., lampblack)&mdash;all of which are known chemically as 
"carbon"&mdash;or, to take another example, yellow phosphorus (a yellow, 
waxy, highly inflammable solid) and red phosphorus (a 
difficultly-inflammable, dark red substance, probably possessing a 
minutely crystalline structure), are, moreover, convertible one into the 
other.<ref target="RedAlch7.27" n="127">27</ref> It has been customary to 
refer to such substances as different forms or allotropic modifications 
of the same element, and not to regard them as being different elements. 
As Professor Howe says, "If after defining `elements' as substances 
hitherto indivisible, and different elements as those which differ in at 
least some one property, and after asserting that the elements cannot be 
transmuted into each other, we are confronted with the change from 
diamond into lampblack, and with the facts, first, that each is clearly 
 
<pb n="138"/>  
 
indivisible hitherto and hence an element, and, second, that they differ 
in every property, we try to escape in a circle by saying that they are 
not different elements because they do change into each other.  In 
short, we limit the name `element' to indivisible substances which 
cannot be transmuted into each other, and we define those which do 
transmute as <hi rend="italic">ipso facto</hi> one element, and then we say that the 
elements cannot be transmuted. Is not this very like saying that, if you 
call a calf's tail a leg, then a calf has five legs? And if it is just 
to reply that calling a tail a leg does not make it a leg, is it not 
equally just to reply that calling two transmutable elements one element 
does not make them so? 
 
 
</p><p>"Is it philosophical to point to the fact that two such 
transmutable elements yield but a single line of derivatives as proof 
that they are one element?  Is not this rather proof of the readiness, 
indeed irresistibleness, of their transmutation? Does not this simply 
mean that the derivativeless element, whenever it enters into 
combination, inevitably transmutes into its mate which has 
derivatives?<ref target="RedAlch7.28" n="128">28</ref> 
 
 
</p><p>According to the atomic theory the differences between what are 
termed "allotropic modifications" are generally ascribed to differences 
in the number and arrangement of the atoms constituting the molecules of 
such "modifications," and not to any differences in the atoms 
themselves. But we cannot argue that two such "allotropic modifications" 
or elements which are transmutable into one another 
 
<pb n="139"/>  
 
are one and the same element, because they possess the same atomic 
weight, and different elements are distinguished by different atomic 
weights; for the reason that, in the determination of atomic weights, 
derivatives of such bodies are employed; hence, the value obtained is 
the atomic weight of the element which forms derivatives, from which 
that of its derivativeless mate may differ considerably for all we know 
to the contrary, if we do, indeed, regard the atomic weights of the 
elements as having any meaning beyond expressing the inertia-ratios in 
which they combine one with another. 
 
</p><p>If we wish to distinguish between two such "allotropic 
modifications" apart from any theoretical views concerning the nature 
and constitution of matter, we can say that such "modifications" are 
different because equal weights of them contain, or are equivalent to, 
different quantities of energy,<ref target="RedAlch7.29" n="129">29</ref> 
since the change of one "form" to another takes place only with the 
evolution or absorption (as the case may be) of heat. 
<ref target="RedAlch7.30" n="130">30</ref> But, according to modern views regarding 
the nature of matter, this is the sole fundamental 
 
<pb n="140"/>  
 
difference between two different elements&mdash;such are different because 
equal weights of them contain or are equivalent to different quantities 
of energy. The so-called "allotropic modifications of an element," 
therefore, are just as much different elements as any other different 
elements, and the change from one "modification" to another is a true 
transmutation of the elements; the only distinction being that what are 
called "allotropic modifications of the same element" differ only 
slightly in respect of the energy they contain, and hence are 
comparatively easy to convert one into the other. whereas different 
elements (so called) differ very greatly from one another in this 
respect, whence it is to be concluded that the transmutation of one such 
element into another will only be attained by the utilisation of energy 
in a very highly concentrated form, such as is evolved simultaneously 
with the spontaneous decomposition of the radium emanation.</p> 
</div2> 
 
<div2 type="section" n="103" id="d118"> 
<head>&sect; 103. Conclusion.</head> 
 
<p>We have shown that modern science indicates the essential truth of 
alchemistic doctrine, and our task is ended. Writing in 1904, Sir 
William Ramsay said: "If these hypotheses [concerning the possibility of 
causing the atoms of ordinary elements to absorb energy] are just, then 
the transmutations of the elements no longer appears an idle dream. The 
philosopher's stone will have been discovered, and it is not beyond the 
bounds of possibility that it may lead to that other goal of the 
philosophers of the dark ages&mdash;the <hi rend="italic">elixir vit&aelig;</hi>. For the 
action of living cells is also dependent on the nature and direction of 
the energy which they contain; and who can say that it will be 
 
<pb n="141"/>  
 
impossible to control their action, when the means of imparting and 
controlling energy shall have been investigated?" 
<ref target="RedAlch7.31" n="131">31</ref> Whatever may be the final verdict 
concerning his own experiments, those of Sir Ernest Rutherford, referred 
to in the Preface to the present edition, demonstrate the fact of 
transmutation; and it is worth noticing how many of the alchemists' 
obscure descriptions of their Magistery well apply to that marvellous 
something which we call Energy, the true "First Matter" of the Universe.
