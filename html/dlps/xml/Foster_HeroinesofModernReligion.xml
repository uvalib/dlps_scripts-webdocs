<p>A preface is supposed to be an <reg orig="acknowledg-|ment">acknowledgment</reg> <lb/>
to those whose help has made possible <lb/>
the book. This preface, then, must first of all <lb/>
thank those enthusiastic readers whose <reg orig="appre-|ciation">appreciation</reg> <lb/>
of the first volume of the Modern <reg orig="Hero-|ine">Heroine</reg> <lb/>
Series gave the editor the enthusiasm <lb/>
which has made the preparation of this book so <lb/>
pleasant a task. To girls such as the one who <lb/>
in a village in the Georgia pinelands found in <lb/>
"Heroines of Modern Progress," not the <reg orig="ac-|count">account</reg> <lb/>
of what ten brilliant women had done for <lb/>
womanhood and the race, but the statement of <lb/>
what she herself wanted to do and, God helping <lb/>
her, would do; to women such as the one who by <lb/>
the sweep of the story of how ten high souled <lb/>
pioneers had blazed new paths for all <reg orig="woman-|hood">womanhood</reg> <lb/>
was carried far beyond the loneliness and <lb/>
hardship of her own heroic pioneering upon a <lb/>
Montana homestead; to men like the New <reg orig="Eng-|land">England</reg> <lb/>
pastor who caught compelling inspiration <lb/>
from what Mrs. Ellen M. Henrotin, Honorary <lb/>
President of the General Federation of <reg orig="Wom-|en's">Women's</reg> <lb/>
Clubs, in her introduction to "Heroines <lb/>
of Modern Progress," calls the development <lb/>
of "the woman from the mere mother of the <lb/>
family to the mother of the group and so to the <lb/>
'World Mother' of to-day"&mdash;to them and others <lb/>
like them is due the credit for whatever <reg orig="excel-|lence">excellence</reg> <lb/>
these ten biographies may have. And <lb/>
<pb n="ii" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0019"/>
the several authors are the first to acknowledge <lb/>
this indebtedness.</p>
<p>To tell the stories of the representative <lb/>
women who, luminous as examples of personal <lb/>
sanctification and whole-souled ministry, have <lb/>
brought numberless men and women into a <lb/>
more harmonious relation with their Maker, is <lb/>
the purpose of this book. Fittingly, the first <lb/>
volume of the series, "Heroines of Modern <lb/>
Progress," pictured the lives of ten women <lb/>
representative of the whole, well-rounded <reg orig="femi-|nine">feminine</reg> <lb/>
endeavor to make this world of ours a <lb/>
better one in which to live. Fittingly also, this, <lb/>
the second volume of the series, is devoted to <lb/>
ten women who made vital contribution to the <lb/>
development and application of religious <lb/>
thought. How faint is the line between the <lb/>
two groups is shown by the life of Hannah <lb/>
Whitall Smith, who, as "mother confessor" to <lb/>
the women of the first group and a member of <lb/>
the second, binds the two volumes together.</p>
<p>In deciding upon the subjects for this <reg orig="vol-|ume">volume</reg>, <lb/>
the editor was again embarrassed by the <lb/>
number of women whose personalities and <reg orig="ef-|forts">efforts</reg> <lb/>
were so far-reaching that they deserved <lb/>
inclusion. So typical and so diverse, however, <lb/>
have been the spiritual and social achievements <lb/>
of the ten women chosen that the editor hopes <lb/>
that this volume will in truth serve as a record <lb/>
of the religious progress of the last three <reg orig="cen-|turies">centuries</reg>. <lb/>
How unified and closely knit is the <lb/>
story of that progress is shown by the <reg orig="chrono-|logical">chronological</reg> <lb/>
conspectus at the end of the book.</p>
<pb n="iii" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0020"/>
<p>And how great has been that progress! How <lb/>
vividly is pictured the sweep of three hundred <lb/>
years when one sees Anne Hutchinson standing <lb/>
alone at the bar of the General Court of the <lb/>
Massachusetts Bay Colony about to be banished <lb/>
because she believed in salvation by faith <reg orig="in-|stead">instead</reg> <lb/>
of by works, and Maud Ballington Booth, <lb/>
in whose life faith and works found perfect <lb/>
union, standing before the mellowing criminals <lb/>
at Sing Sing to hold out to them the promise <lb/>
of regeneration here and now and in the world <lb/>
to come.</p>
<p>Because of the diversity of mind, method and <lb/>
creed of the ten women, the editor felt that by <lb/>
intrusting to different writers the different <reg orig="bi-|ographies">biographies</reg> <lb/>
he would secure a sympathetic but <lb/>
critically just treatment that would otherwise <lb/>
be impossible. All of these religious leaders, <lb/>
however, rise so far above the limitations of <lb/>
prejudice and creed that their glowing lives are <lb/>
part of the heritage of the race. For no sect <lb/>
or cause, does the author of any chapter or the <lb/>
editor of the series hold a brief; the women are <lb/>
always women, interesting as such as well as <lb/>
for what they have done to make life brighter <lb/>
for all of us.</p>
<p>The editor cannot give too warm praise to <lb/>
the six men and women who have labored with <lb/>
him in the effort to make each biography a vivid <lb/>
and true picture of one woman who has helped <lb/>
all of us enter into a fuller spiritual life and to <lb/>
make the ten biographies a vivid and true <reg orig="pic-|ture">picture</reg> <lb/>
of the contribution of all modern <reg orig="woman-|hood">womanhood</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="iv" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0021"/>
to the cause of religious progress. By <lb/>
painstaking care, by loyalty to the work as a <lb/>
whole, by patience with the criticisms, just and <lb/>
unjust, of those experts to whom this work <lb/>
was submitted, by kindly deference to the <reg orig="ed-|itor's">editor's</reg> <lb/>
insistent demands for the certainty of <lb/>
accuracy in facts that are incidental as well as <lb/>
in those that are essential, by &hellip; but the <lb/>
qualities by the exercise of which the <reg orig="collab-|orators">collaborators</reg> <lb/>
won the editor's admiration are too <reg orig="nu-|merous">numerous</reg> <lb/>
to catalogue.</p>

ANNE HUTCHINSON</hi></head>
<byline><hi rend="small-caps">by anne elizabeth jenkins</hi></byline>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Among</hi> the records of the life of Anne <lb/>
Hutchinson, no account is found which <reg orig="pic-|tures">pictures</reg> <lb/>
her as a little girl. It would seem as <lb/>
though the Puritans in their stern outlook on <lb/>
life made no place for childhood with its sunny <lb/>
irresponsibility, and so never had the interest <lb/>
nor curiosity to inquire into that of the woman <lb/>
who was the storm center of one of their most <lb/>
bitter religious controversies. It would be <lb/>
interesting to know whether or not the little <lb/>
Anne had her childish longings and searchings <lb/>
for God, and whether her quick wit and ready <lb/>
repartee were developed by friendly sparrings <lb/>
with her father and her playmates. What of <lb/>
the childish personality that developed into <lb/>
the bright, intelligent, courageous woman of <lb/>
later years? It is possible only to speculate, <lb/>
however, about these early days in <reg orig="Lincoln-|shire">Lincolnshire</reg>. <lb/>
The grimly spirited controversy which <lb/>
she started in Boston has turned the <reg orig="search-|light">searchlight</reg> <lb/>
so full upon the three years of her <reg orig="preach-|ings">preachings</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="2" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0027"/>
and discussions there, that what came <reg orig="be-|fore">before</reg> <lb/>
and after is in the shadow.</p>
<p>We know that she was born in 1590 in <lb/>
Lincolnshire, and that her father, William <reg orig="Mar-|bury">Marbury</reg>, <lb/>
was a preacher&mdash;first in her birthplace <lb/>
and later in London. This fact would lead us <lb/>
to suppose that Anne was early trained in <reg orig="re-|ligion">religion</reg> <lb/>
and doctrine. Since the family was in <lb/>
good position there Anne was of gentle descent.</p>
<p>When she came to America in 1634 she was <lb/>
already married to William Hutchinson, a man <lb/>
of good estate who had lived at Alfred in the <lb/>
same shire with the Marburys. Almost <reg orig="noth-|ing">nothing</reg> <lb/>
is recorded of this man except that he <reg orig="re-|mained">remained</reg> <lb/>
faithful to his wife through her <reg orig="per-|secutions">persecutions</reg>. <lb/>
Governor Winthrop says of him <lb/>
that he was a man of very mild temper and <lb/>
weak parts and was wholly guided by his wife. <lb/>
Although Governor Winthrop was a man of <reg orig="up-|right">upright</reg> <lb/>
and noble nature, he was thoroughly <reg orig="hu-|man">human</reg>, <lb/>
and it could hardly be expected that he <lb/>
would look at the Hutchinson family with an <lb/>
unprejudiced eye.</p>
<p>What Mrs. Hutchinson called her revelations <lb/>
was the cause of their leaving England. For <lb/>
some time before their departure she had had <lb/>
"inward struggles" and "flashings of <reg orig="convic-|tions">convictions</reg>" <lb/>
that told her, she thought, that the only <lb/>
preachers who were acceptable to God were her <lb/>
brother-in-law, John Wheelright; and John <lb/>
Cotton. When these two clergymen decided <lb/>
to sail for America the revelation came to Mrs. <lb/>
Hutchinson to follow them. Either her <reg orig="hus-|band">husband</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="3" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0028"/>
shared her convictions in regard to these <lb/>
ministers or else he loved his wife sufficiently <lb/>
to be willing to follow her into the new <reg orig="coun-|try">country</reg>, <lb/>
regardless of his own views&mdash;in any case <lb/>
he accompanied her to America. It is not <lb/>
probable that she had formulated very <reg orig="defi-|nitely">definitely</reg> <lb/>
her religious opinions before she left <lb/>
England but she held firmly to the belief that <lb/>
God spoke to her as directly as He did to <lb/>
Abraham or the prophets, and she must have <lb/>
been fairly certain of the "covenant of grace" <lb/>
which she afterwards maintained so fervently. <lb/>
That she gave vent to "peculiar opinions" on <lb/>
board the ship <hi rend="italic">Griffin</hi> coming over, is testified <lb/>
to by a fellow passenger, a Mr. Symmes, who <lb/>
was so disturbed by her views that, upon <reg orig="land-|ing">landing</reg>, <lb/>
he hurried to the authorities to report her <lb/>
lack of orthodoxy. His accusations against <lb/>
Mrs. Hutchinson had enough weight with the <lb/>
church to prevent her immediate admission to <lb/>
membership. Her husband was accepted but <lb/>
she was kept waiting for some time.</p>
<p>In a realm very different from that of <lb/>
theological discussion she began to attract <reg orig="no-|tice">notice</reg> <lb/>
almost immediately. Her many acts of <lb/>
simple kindness endeared her to the women of <lb/>
the colony. Whenever there was sickness she <lb/>
gave of her time and her sympathy until she <lb/>
became greatly beloved among her own sex. <lb/>
Her mind was full of her religious convictions, <lb/>
and so it was but natural that she should speak <lb/>
of them to the sick whom she was tending. It <lb/>
is easy to picture her sitting beside the bed of <lb/>
<pb n="4" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0029"/>
a young mother and talking eloquently of the <lb/>
spirit of God in our hearts, while she cared for <lb/>
the baby which she had just helped bring into <lb/>
the world. It is easy to understand, too, how <lb/>
the young mother would eagerly drink in what <lb/>
she had to say&mdash;because it was less stern and <lb/>
severe than the preachings which she heard at <lb/>
the bare meeting house of the town.</p>
<p>This pleasant picture of Mrs. Hutchinson, <lb/>
the kind friend and neighbor, is very different <lb/>
from the one which her enemies painted. <lb/>
Thomas Welde describes her as a woman "of <lb/>
haughty and fierce carriage, of nimble wit and <lb/>
active spirit and a very voluble tongue, more <lb/>
bold than a man though in understanding and <lb/>
judgment inferior to many women." Since it <lb/>
is hard to imagine a woman of haughty and <lb/>
fierce carriage caring so tenderly for the weak <lb/>
and helpless, it is well to remember in reading <lb/>
this description that it was written by a man <lb/>
who bitterly hated the woman of whom he <lb/>
wrote. That no description of her physical <lb/>
personality has come down to us is a strange <lb/>
fact. It would seem as if she could not have <lb/>
been a woman of any distinctive outward <lb/>
beauty or physical charm, or some hint of this <lb/>
attractiveness would have crept into the <reg orig="rec-|ords">records</reg> <lb/>
of her life. Yet history tells us that the <lb/>
women of her family had for years been noted <lb/>
for their exceptional comeliness. <reg orig="Unfortu-|nately">Unfortunately</reg> <lb/>
the contemporary accounts of her are <lb/>
for the most part the work of her enemies. <lb/>
Governor Winthrop, however, who would be a <lb/>
<pb n="5" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0030"/>
fairer antagonist than Welde, describes her as <lb/>
having a bold spirit and ready wit. There <lb/>
must have been a lovable side to Anne <reg orig="Hutch-|inson">Hutchinson</reg> <lb/>
for it is said that no one who was once <lb/>
her friend ever became her enemy. Even <reg orig="Cot-|ton">Cotton</reg>, <lb/>
who repudiated her teachings, remained <lb/>
friendly to her.</p>
<p>These doctrines and opinions which Mrs. <lb/>
Hutchinson expressed to her women friends&mdash; <lb/>
and later to both sexes&mdash;spread very rapidly. <lb/>
The women began to meet at her house, and <lb/>
before the authorities realized what was <reg orig="hap-|pening">happening</reg>, <lb/>
some eighty or one hundred women <lb/>
were gathering every week to discuss and <reg orig="up-|hold">uphold</reg> <lb/>
the doctrines of antinomianism, and their <lb/>
beliefs had converted practically the whole <lb/>
Boston Church.</p>
<p>In order to understand the events which <reg orig="fol-|lowed">followed</reg> <lb/>
it is necessary to consider two things&mdash; <lb/>
first, the social situation in Boston in 1637 and <lb/>
second, the doctrine of antinomianism.</p>
<p>It was just seventeen years since the Pilgrim <lb/>
Fathers had landed in America. The spirit of <lb/>
desperate sincerity and seriousness which they <lb/>
brought with them to the new country was still <lb/>
strong in the breasts of the colonists of New <lb/>
England. Their lives were full of privation <lb/>
and hardship and they had little time for <reg orig="any-|thing">anything</reg> <lb/>
but work and prayer. Religion was the <lb/>
food and comfort of their souls&mdash;"the food <lb/>
which ate up all the attachments and <reg orig="remem-|brances">remembrances</reg> <lb/>
of home, all their regrets at leaving it, <lb/>
very many if not all of their baser passions." <lb/>
<pb n="6" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0031"/>
They had little time for relaxation or <reg orig="amuse-|ment">amusement</reg>. <lb/>
The few hours left them after their <lb/>
daily labor were given to prayer or religious <lb/>
discussions. The Bible was about their only <lb/>
literature. There were no libraries, no <reg orig="news-|papers">newspapers</reg>, <lb/>
no daily mail, no clubs, no gatherings <lb/>
merely social. All the people were prophets. <lb/>
The greatest stress was laid upon merely <reg orig="for-|mal">formal</reg> <lb/>
observances. The church services were <lb/>
hours long. People went about with solemn <lb/>
faces, and sanctimonious air, and filled their <lb/>
conversation with scriptural phrases. <reg orig="Every-|where">Everywhere</reg> <lb/>
it was the letter of the law which was <lb/>
emphasized. In such an atmosphere as this the <lb/>
gatherings at Mrs. Hutchinson's home were <lb/>
oases in the desert to women who "kept silence <lb/>
in the churches" and were barred from the <reg orig="dis-|cussional">discussional</reg> <lb/>
gatherings. They were the only <lb/>
social events of the season and as such they <reg orig="be-|came">became</reg> <lb/>
exceedingly popular.</p>
<p>And now as to what Mrs. Hutchinson <reg orig="dis-|cussed">discussed</reg> <lb/>
with these women&mdash;the opinions which <lb/>
she advanced.</p>
<p>Antinomianism was no new doctrine. It had <lb/>
been preached in Judea, in Germany, in <reg orig="Eng-|land">England</reg>. <lb/>
In its essence it was merely opposition <lb/>
to legalism; Christ, not Moses; the spirit, not <lb/>
the letter. The Antinomians spoke of this <lb/>
choice as the "covenant of grace," as opposed <lb/>
to that of works. They said: "Just because <lb/>
you observe the letter of the law is no proof <lb/>
that you are good in your heart&mdash;your good <lb/>
works may be mere outward show. The vital <lb/>
<pb n="7" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0032"/>
thing is to secure a state of heart which will <lb/>
make evidence of holiness." They did not <reg orig="ad-|vise">advise</reg> <lb/>
the discontinuance of good works, but <lb/>
warned against making clean merely the <reg orig="out-|side">outside</reg> <lb/>
of the platter.</p>
<p>Their own idea was that of the Master who <lb/>
denounced the scribes and Pharisees for their <lb/>
observances which were merely outward. <reg orig="Un-|fortunately">Unfortunately</reg>, <lb/>
however, it was perverted to mean <lb/>
"there is no necessity for good works&mdash;the <lb/>
true believer can do nothing that is sinful." <lb/>
The result of this perversion was, in Europe, a <lb/>
series of outrages committed in the name of <lb/>
religion. The Massachusetts people knew of <lb/>
these and felt that they must carefully guard <lb/>
against any such excesses. The colonists had <lb/>
good reason to be forehanded; they had been <lb/>
reported as having swarmed to America to <lb/>
find elbow room for fanaticism, and since <reg orig="ex-|aggerated">exaggerated</reg> <lb/>
accounts of the disorder were at <lb/>
once sent back to England, every disturbance <lb/>
endangered their charter. Hence they were <lb/>
especially loath to have the doctrines of <reg orig="An-|tinomianism">Antinomianism</reg> <lb/>
taught in their midst, but they did <lb/>
not realize its alarming spread until practically <lb/>
all the Boston Church, including Governor <lb/>
Vane himself, had come under the "covenant <lb/>
of grace&mdash;not of works," and were the devoted <lb/>
followers and warm supporters of Mrs. <reg orig="Hutch-|inson">Hutchinson</reg>.</p>
<p>It is difficult for the twentieth century reader <lb/>
to understand the situation in Boston at this <lb/>
time. It must be remembered that politics and <lb/>
<pb n="8" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0033"/>
religion were so closely related that one could <lb/>
not be affected without touching the other.</p>
<p>The meetings at Mrs. Hutchinson's which <lb/>
had originally been devoted to emphasizing <lb/>
what Mr. Cotton was preaching&mdash;the "<reg orig="cove-|nant">covenant</reg> <lb/>
of grace"&mdash;gradually began to be devoted <lb/>
largely to the criticism of the sermons of every <lb/>
other minister in the colony. The assertion <lb/>
was that they were preaching a covenant of <lb/>
works. Now this accusation was stinging; the <lb/>
Puritans had revolted from the Church of <reg orig="Eng-|land">England</reg> <lb/>
because outward observances had to a <lb/>
large measure replaced spirituality. So to be <lb/>
accused of setting up a new covenant of works <lb/>
was irritating in the extreme. Unfortunately <lb/>
about this time Mrs. Hutchinson began to lose <lb/>
her grip upon herself and upon good sense. <lb/>
She and her followers manifested more and <lb/>
more the "holier than thou" attitude.</p>
<p>They attended the services of first one <lb/>
church and then another for the sole purpose <lb/>
of criticising the sermons. There came to be <lb/>
certain pastors under whom they refused to <lb/>
sit. Whenever Pastor Wilson preached, Mrs. <lb/>
Hutchinson and her followers left the meeting <lb/>
house. They frequently sent letters to <reg orig="clergy-|men">clergymen</reg> <lb/>
whom they accused of being under the <lb/>
covenant of works.</p>
<p>After a while the followers of Mrs. <reg orig="Hutchin-|son">Hutchinson</reg> <lb/>
began to distort her teachings, just as <lb/>
Antinomianism had been distorted in Europe. <lb/>
In America, however, few excesses resulted <lb/>
from this perversion. They declared that good <lb/>
<pb n="9" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0034"/>
works were unnecessary to those who were <reg orig="un-|der">under</reg> <lb/>
the covenant of grace&mdash;that is to those who <lb/>
were certain of the spirit of God in their hearts. <lb/>
Then they went so far as to say that good <lb/>
works were a mark of Cain; upright men, <lb/>
especially all the ministers except Wheelright <lb/>
and Cotton, simply because of their uprightness <lb/>
fell under the suspicion of lack of grace. An <lb/>
example of the perversion of Mrs. Hutchinson's <lb/>
doctrine is in Captain Underhill. He averred <lb/>
that he had "lain under a spirit of bondage in <lb/>
a legal way five years and could get no <reg orig="as-|surance">assurance</reg> <lb/>
until at length as he was taking a pipe <lb/>
of tobacco the spirit sent him an absolute <reg orig="prom-|ise">promise</reg> <lb/>
of free grace with such assurance and joy <lb/>
as he never since doubted of his good estate; <lb/>
neither should he though he should fall into <lb/>
sin." And resting serenely on this assurance <lb/>
of grace, the captain continued to indulge in <lb/>
the grossest immoralities! It is in no way fair <lb/>
to blame Mrs. Hutchinson for these excesses or <lb/>
distortions. She was powerless to control <lb/>
them, and she herself lived always an upright <lb/>
life&mdash;full of good works. Yet it is clear that <lb/>
the doctrine of covenant by grace and not by <lb/>
works was one which gave dangerous loopholes <lb/>
to the would-be sinner and enormous <reg orig="possibili-|ties">possibilities</reg> <lb/>
to the hair-splitting brethren. The <reg orig="Bib-|lical">Biblical</reg> <lb/>
warning, "Faith without works is dead," <lb/>
seems never to have loomed into the vision of <lb/>
our Bible-reading forefathers of that day. No <lb/>
one thought of joining the two rival covenants <lb/>
to form a complete whole, and so the strife <lb/>
<pb n="10" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0035"/>
grew more and more bitter. Children playing <lb/>
together asked each other: "Is your father <reg orig="un-|der">under</reg> <lb/>
a covenant of grace or a covenant of <lb/>
works?"; the assessments of rates and the <reg orig="dis-|tribution">distribution</reg> <lb/>
of town lots were affected by the same <lb/>
question, and affairs reached a climax when the <lb/>
military forces of the colony mustered for the <lb/>
campaign against the Pequots were ready to <lb/>
shirk the service because they suspected their <lb/>
chaplain of being under a covenant of works! <lb/>
The rival forces were divided into two distinct <lb/>
groups. On the one side was Mrs. Hutchinson, <lb/>
Wheelright, Vane and Cotton&mdash;although he <reg orig="de-|serted">deserted</reg> <lb/>
them toward the end of the struggle&mdash;; <lb/>
on the other, Winthrop and every minister in <lb/>
the colony outside of Boston. Poor souls, <lb/>
their lives had been made miserable for them; <lb/>
their uprightness had been made a subject of <lb/>
suspicion, their orthodoxy and soundness had <lb/>
been challenged and their congregations had <lb/>
been diminished.</p>
<p>Finally they met, six hundred and <reg orig="thirty-|seven">thirty-seven</reg> <lb/>
of them, and agreed to put all lectures <lb/>
aside for three weeks until the controversy <lb/>
should be settled. They held a synod, at which <lb/>
they first attacked Mr. Wheelright on the <lb/>
charge of heresy. The assembled ministers <lb/>
found him guilty as he denied nothing&mdash;only <lb/>
affirmed his views the more stoutly. When the <lb/>
decision of the synod was made public a storm <lb/>
of dissent went up and a protest against this <lb/>
judgment was sent to the Great and General <lb/>
Court. The Court would not receive it. As <lb/>
<pb n="11" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0036"/>
Wheelright refused to retract anything he had <lb/>
said, he was arrested. He had been convicted <lb/>
of heresy&mdash;that most serious of all offenses in <lb/>
this church-state&mdash;and there was no escape <lb/>
from the logical consequence, punishment by <lb/>
its civil arm. Accordingly he was convicted. <lb/>
He immediately appealed to King Charles but <lb/>
his appeal was ignored. Sentence was, <reg orig="how-|ever">however</reg>, <lb/>
suspended until the next session of the <lb/>
General Court when it was ordered enforced <lb/>
and Wheelright was driven out of the Colony.</p>
<p>The Court had put its hand to the plow and <lb/>
would not turn back. What was heresy and <lb/>
treason in the preacher Wheelright was no less <lb/>
in Mrs. Hutchinson. She was regarded as the <lb/>
instigator of the whole trouble. The next step <lb/>
was to eject Vane from the governorship and <lb/>
substitute Winthrop. Vane sailed for England <lb/>
and the report spread that he intended to <reg orig="ob-|tain">obtain</reg> <lb/>
help for Mrs. Hutchinson at the English <lb/>
Court. Almost to a man her own church <reg orig="or-|ganization">organization</reg> <lb/>
was staunchly supporting Mrs. <lb/>
Hutchinson but feeling ran higher and higher <lb/>
until at last she was called for trial.</p>
<p>She was tried before the Great and General <lb/>
Court of Massachusetts, the dignified <reg orig="legisla-|tive">legislative</reg> <lb/>
body of the commonwealth, which has <reg orig="re-|tained">retained</reg> <lb/>
its formal name to this day. It was no <lb/>
ordinary court of law&mdash;it was an assembly of <lb/>
delegate freemen from all Massachusetts Bay <lb/>
Colony. From the decisions of this Court <lb/>
there was no appeal except to the king across <lb/>
the water and, as in the Wheelright case, such <lb/>
<pb n="12" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0037"/>
appeal was not always allowed. There were <lb/>
other magistrates, men of local authority, but <lb/>
the Great and General Court was the embodied <lb/>
will of the Puritan Colony. To this tribunal <lb/>
was Mrs. Hutchinson summoned.</p>
<p>The identity of Church and State was <reg orig="abso-|lute">absolute</reg>. <lb/>
There were no freemen except church <lb/>
members, no tests of citizenship except <reg orig="adher-|ence">adherence</reg> <lb/>
to the creed. It was not a question of <lb/>
Church <hi rend="italic">and</hi> State; the Church <hi rend="italic">was</hi> the State; <lb/>
literally as well as figuratively violence to the <lb/>
creed was treason to the State. Heresy and <lb/>
sedition were synonymous. Therefore when <lb/>
Anne Hutchinson taught her heresies, if <lb/>
heresies they were, she offended the State and <lb/>
to the State she must answer. It was not Anne <lb/>
Hutchinson, however, who was on trial. It <lb/>
was religious freedom that stood before the <lb/>
bar. With Roger Williams and the Quakers, <lb/>
she answered in her person for the spirit of <lb/>
toleration and charity in creed and doctrine. <lb/>
But with them she suffered. Not yet was <reg orig="Mas-|sachusetts">Massachusetts</reg> <lb/>
ready for the larger faith of later <lb/>
years.</p>
<p>All the magistrates and assistants of the <lb/>
upper house took part in the trial. Endicott <lb/>
was there and Bradstreet, Harlakenden, <lb/>
Stoughton and Nowell, with Governor <reg orig="Win-|throp">Winthrop</reg> <lb/>
in the chair. And there, too, was every <lb/>
clergyman in the colony, smarting under the <lb/>
implications which Mrs. Hutchinson had placed <lb/>
upon him. Cotton by now had gone over to <lb/>
the enemy, though he later defended Mrs. <lb/>
<pb n="13" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0038"/>
Hutchinson in court. Before this august body <lb/>
this woman of unchallenged piety and of high <lb/>
excellence of character was held to account, for <lb/>
maintaining certain theological opinions. She <lb/>
was kept standing until her evident bodily <reg orig="in-|firmity">infirmity</reg> <lb/>
obtained the privilege of sitting. <reg orig="Gov-|ernor">Governor</reg> <lb/>
Winthrop, although he could not accuse <lb/>
her of a single offense which would subject her <lb/>
to court punishment, heaped censures upon her. <lb/>
She had "defamed ministers," had "<reg orig="main-|tained">maintained</reg> <lb/>
meetings at her house not comely in the <lb/>
sight of God nor fitting for her sex;" "though <lb/>
the synod had denounced them she had <reg orig="per-|sisted">persisted</reg> <lb/>
in holding them." After this <reg orig="denuncia-|tion">denunciation</reg> <lb/>
Mrs. Hutchinson quietly replied:</p>
<p>"I am called here to answer before you, but <lb/>
I hear no things to my charge."</p>
<p>Governor: "I have told you some already <lb/>
and more I can tell you."</p>
<p>Mrs. Hutchinson: "Name one, sir."</p>
<p>Governor: "Have I not named some <reg orig="al-|ready">already</reg>?"</p>
<p>Mrs. Hutchinson: "What have I said or <lb/>
done?"</p>
<p>Then she was accused of having defamed the <lb/>
characters of the clergymen.</p>
<p>Throughout the trial Mrs. Hutchinson showed <lb/>
herself keen and quick, well poised and utterly <lb/>
fearless. The accusers vaguely wandered on: <lb/>
"They had heard that she had said," "it was <lb/>
reported that this was so." Invariably she <lb/>
would answer, "I pray, sir, prove it that I said <lb/>
they preached nothing but a covenant of <lb/>
<pb n="14" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0039"/>
works," and they had no proof. Apparently <lb/>
the greater part of the controversy rested on <lb/>
misinterpretations of the opinions of Mrs. <reg orig="Hut-|chinson">Hutchinson</reg>. <lb/>
That she had privately made <reg orig="im-|pulsive">impulsive</reg> <lb/>
criticisms of some of the clergymen is <lb/>
doubtless true, but that she had publicly <reg orig="de-|famed">defamed</reg> <lb/>
their lives, they could not prove. To <lb/>
every statement which they made came back <lb/>
that steady "Prove this then, sir, that you say <lb/>
I did."</p>
<p>When the first group of charges fell because <lb/>
of lack of definite proof, Mrs. Hutchinson with <lb/>
saneness and courage boldly anticipated any <lb/>
further accusations by deliberately restating <lb/>
and defending her obnoxious doctrines. <reg orig="Pos-|sibly">Possibly</reg> <lb/>
she hoped by shifting the attack to <reg orig="con-|fuse">confuse</reg> <lb/>
her enemies. Possibly she hoped in the <lb/>
more purely theological aspects of the <reg orig="con-|troversy">controversy</reg> <lb/>
to enlist new friends. Possibly she <lb/>
foresaw the certain result and rushed to meet <lb/>
it. At any rate she made no secret of her <lb/>
tenets and boldly defended them.</p>
<p>She claimed to have communion directly with <lb/>
God and not necessarily through the Scriptures. <lb/>
Blasphemy! She claimed to have revelations <lb/>
and defended them. She spoke of those which <lb/>
had led her to accept Cotton and Wheelright as <lb/>
the true ministers of God, and to follow them <lb/>
to America, saying that she would be delivered <lb/>
now from all danger and risk by God as was <lb/>
Daniel in the lion's den. The glowing style of <lb/>
her language and the boldness of her address <lb/>
led one of the ministers to suggest that she was <lb/>
<pb n="15" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0040"/>
rather an antitype of the lions than of Daniel. <lb/>
She said in part: "I bless the Lord who hath <lb/>
let me see which was the clear ministry and <lb/>
which was the wrong. Since that time I <reg orig="con-|fess">confess</reg> <lb/>
I have been more choice and he hath led <lb/>
me to distinguish between the voice of my <reg orig="be-|loved">beloved</reg> <lb/>
and the voice of Moses, the voice of John <lb/>
the Baptist and the voice of anti-Christ, for all <lb/>
those voices are spoken of in Scripture. Now <lb/>
if you do condemn me for speaking what in my <lb/>
conscience I know to be truth, I must commit <lb/>
myself unto the Lord."</p>
<p>Mr. Nowell: "How do you know that that <lb/>
was the spirit?"</p>
<p>Mrs. Hutchinson: "How did Abraham know <lb/>
that it was God that bid him offer his son, being <lb/>
a breach of the sixth commandment."</p>
<p>Deputy Governor: "By an immediate <lb/>
voice."</p>
<p>Mrs. Hutchinson: "So to me by an <reg orig="im-|mediate">immediate</reg> <lb/>
revelation!"</p>
<p>Deputy Governor: "How! An immediate <lb/>
revelation!"</p>
<p>Mrs. Hutchinson: "By the voice of His own <lb/>
spirit to my soul." "But now having seen <lb/>
Him which is invisible, I fear not what man can <lb/>
do to me."</p>
<p>Governor Winthrop: "Daniel was delivered <lb/>
by a miracle; do you think to be delivered so <lb/>
too?"</p>
<p>Mrs. Hutchinson: "I do here speak it <reg orig="be-|fore">before</reg> <lb/>
the Court. I look that the Lord should <lb/>
deliver me by His providence."</p>
<pb n="16" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0041"/>
<p>After a long trial, which makes tiresome <lb/>
enough reading, and which seems to us an <reg orig="ab-|surd">absurd</reg> <lb/>
haggling over definitions and terms, the <lb/>
governor declared:</p>
<p>"The groundwork of her revelations is the <lb/>
immediate revelation of the spirit and not by <lb/>
the ministry of the word, and that is the means <lb/>
by which she hath abused the country that they <lb/>
should look for revelations and not turn to the <lb/>
ministry of the word."</p>
<p>The Court replied: "We all consent with <lb/>
you."</p>
<p>Governor: "Ey! it is most desperate <reg orig="en-|thusiasm">enthusiasm</reg> <lb/>
in the world for nothing but a word <lb/>
comes to her mind and then an application is <lb/>
made which is nothing to the purpose and this <lb/>
is her revelations when it is impossible but that <lb/>
the word and the spirit should speak the same <lb/>
thing. The Court hath already declared <reg orig="them-|selves">themselves</reg> <lb/>
satisfied concerning the things you hear <lb/>
concerning the troublesomeness of her spirit <lb/>
and the danger of her course amongst us, which <lb/>
is not to be suffered. Therefore, if it is the <lb/>
mind of the Court that she shall be banished <lb/>
out of our liberties and imprisoned till she be <lb/>
sent away, let them raise their hands."</p>
<p>All but three hands went up.</p>
<p>"Those that are contrary minded hold up <lb/>
yours."</p>
<p>Only Mr. Coddington and Mr. Colburn <reg orig="re-|sponded">responded</reg>. <lb/>
They maintained, not that the <reg orig="de-|fendant">defendant</reg> <lb/>
was in the right, but that the Court had <lb/>
no jurisdiction over her offense.</p>
<pb n="17" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0042"/>
<p>Governor: "Mrs. Hutchinson, the sentence <lb/>
of the Court you hear is that you are banished <lb/>
from out of our jurisdiction as being a woman <lb/>
not fit for our society and are to be imprisoned <lb/>
till the Court shall send you away."</p>
<p>Mrs. Hutchinson: "I desire to know <reg orig="where-|fore">wherefore</reg> <lb/>
I am banished."</p>
<p>Governor: "Say no more. The Court <lb/>
knows wherefore and is satisfied."</p>
<p>The trial was no trial, but rather a mockery <lb/>
of justice. The witnesses in her behalf were <lb/>
browbeaten and silenced in disregard of all <lb/>
fairness, and she herself was badgered and <reg orig="in-|sulted">insulted</reg>. <lb/>
It was a bare-faced inquisitorial <reg orig="pro-|ceeding">proceeding</reg>.</p>
<p>After this parody on justice was ended, Mrs. <lb/>
Hutchinson was imprisoned in the house of <lb/>
Welde's brother, Joseph, in Roxbury, where <lb/>
she was allowed to see only her most intimate <lb/>
friends. Here she was constantly importuned <lb/>
by the zealous minister, Welde, to recant her <lb/>
false views. During her imprisonment she was <lb/>
very melancholy but became more of an oracle <lb/>
than ever.</p>
<p>In the spring the church at Boston drew up <lb/>
a list of heretical opinions which they claimed <lb/>
she held and confronted her with them. She <lb/>
listened patiently and answered each <reg orig="accusa-|tion">accusation</reg> <lb/>
with a modest and pertinent reply, but <reg orig="re-|fused">refused</reg> <lb/>
to recant. She was solemnly admonished <lb/>
by the church, and recalled for a second <reg orig="ex-|amination">examination</reg>. <lb/>
By now she was wearied by this <lb/>
constant nagging. Some things she recanted <lb/>
<pb n="18" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0043"/>
&mdash;and she acknowledged faults of temper, of <lb/>
speech and of conduct. She also owned that <lb/>
her revelations in court were rash and <reg orig="ground-|less">groundless</reg> <lb/>
and she desired the prayers of the church <lb/>
in her behalf. Yet she maintained that she had <lb/>
the liberty to keep her own convictions. These <lb/>
concessions she placed in writing, but the <lb/>
church decided that they were not direct <lb/>
enough, and were subject to misinterpretations. <lb/>
The elders accused her of lying; she denied the <lb/>
accusations. In spite of her denial the sentence <lb/>
of excommunication was pronounced against <lb/>
her:</p>
<p>"Therefore, in the name of the Lord Jesus <lb/>
Christ and in the name of the Church, I do <lb/>
not only pronounce you worthy to be cast out <lb/>
but I do cast you out; and in the name of Christ <lb/>
I do deliver you up to Satan that you may learn <lb/>
no more to blaspheme, to seduce, and to lie, and <lb/>
I do account you from this time forth to be a <lb/>
heathen and a publican and so to be held of <lb/>
all the brethren and sisters of this <reg orig="congrega-|tion">congregation</reg> <lb/>
and of others; therefore, I command you <lb/>
in the name of Christ Jesus and of this church <lb/>
as a leper to withdraw yourself out of the <reg orig="con-|gregation">congregation</reg>."</p>
<p>When, in obedience to his command, Anne <lb/>
Hutchinson&mdash;the outcast&mdash;moved through the <lb/>
awe-struck throng, her devoted friend and <reg orig="fol-|lower">follower</reg>, <lb/>
Mary Dyer, rose and walked by her side <lb/>
and the two passed out together. As they went <lb/>
forth one standing at the meeting-house door <lb/>
said to Mrs. Hutchinson:</p>
<pb n="19" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0044"/>
<p>"The Lord sanctify this unto you."</p>
<p>"The Lord judgeth not as man judgeth," <lb/>
she replied. "Better to be cast out of the <lb/>
church than to deny Christ."</p>
<p>Our forefathers doubtless believed this <lb/>
odious act of persecution to be a political <reg orig="ne-|cessity">necessity</reg>. <lb/>
Moreover, Mrs. Hutchinson had <reg orig="prob-|ably">probably</reg> <lb/>
tried their patience with her methods of <lb/>
procedure. Excuse, however, is scant.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hutchinson sought refuge in Rhode <reg orig="Is-|land">Island</reg> <lb/>
where the colonists were assured of <reg orig="free-|dom">freedom</reg> <lb/>
of religious thought. Her family, with <lb/>
the exception of her married son, accompanied <lb/>
her, and she continued to exhort and teach even <lb/>
in her new home. The ministers of New <reg orig="Eng-|land">England</reg> <lb/>
could not leave her at peace, but sent <lb/>
delegates to remonstrate once again with her. <lb/>
It seems that these "godly" men took the <reg orig="oc-|casion">occasion</reg> <lb/>
to pry into her family life for we read <lb/>
that her husband defended her as a "dear <lb/>
saint" and "servant of God." The testimony <lb/>
of the one who lived closest to her ought to be <lb/>
worth more than that of her antagonists.</p>
<p>In 1642 this faithful companion died. Soon <lb/>
after his death, Mrs. Hutchinson left Rhode <lb/>
Island and went to Long Island, probably to <lb/>
Pelham Neck on the border of what is now <lb/>
called Hutchinson River.</p>
<p>For a woman of such rare mental powers <lb/>
and gentle descent as Anne Hutchinson to have <lb/>
left the civilized society of Rhode Island to <lb/>
bury herself and her family in the wilderness, <lb/>
must have required remarkable elevation of <lb/>
<pb n="20" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0045"/>
purpose and physical daring. But among men <lb/>
she had met with bitter persecution and <reg orig="injus-|tice">injustice</reg> <lb/>
and it is quite probable that she was glad <lb/>
to leave this all behind her, and that she looked <lb/>
forward to years of quiet communion with the <lb/>
God who had been so constantly in her <lb/>
thoughts.</p>
<p>Scarcely were they settled in their new home <lb/>
when Governor Kieft by his treachery and <reg orig="in-|humanity">inhumanity</reg> <lb/>
aroused the fury of the native Indians. <lb/>
Whereupon they resolved to exterminate the <lb/>
Dutch and all connected with them. An army <lb/>
of fifteen hundred warriors swept over Long <lb/>
Island. Everywhere was seen the blaze of <reg orig="bon-|fires">bonfires</reg>, <lb/>
and the war whoops of the savages sent <lb/>
terror to the hearts of the settlers. One of <lb/>
these hideous mornings, so the account runs, <lb/>
an Indian came to the door of Mrs. <reg orig="Hutchin-|son's">Hutchinson's</reg> <lb/>
log cabin, professing friendship, but <lb/>
when he discovered the defenseless condition <lb/>
of the household he returned and butchered <lb/>
all but the youngest daughter, Susan, who <lb/>
was taken prisoner and remained in captivity <lb/>
four years. When she was finally released she <lb/>
knew no language but the Indian.</p>
<p>The news of Mrs. Hutchinson's death was <reg orig="re-|ceived">received</reg> <lb/>
in New England as an evidence of her <lb/>
guilt. It was taken for granted that God was <lb/>
punishing her, and doubtless many ministers <lb/>
made her the subject of that week's sermons. <lb/>
Even previously a superstition, which to the <lb/>
modern mind is almost inconceivable, began to <lb/>
attach significance to every misfortune which <lb/>
<pb n="21" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0046"/>
befell the followers of Mrs. Hutchinson. 'A' <lb/>
poor barber, called hastily to perform a <reg orig="den-|tist's">dentist's</reg> <lb/>
office, becomes bewildered in a storm of <lb/>
snow between Roxbury and Boston and is <lb/>
frozen to death. Presently it is remembered <lb/>
that he had been a theological adherent of Mrs. <lb/>
Hutchinson.</p>
<p>Welde makes note of her death and adds: "I <lb/>
never heard that the Indians in those parts did <lb/>
ever before this commit the like outrage upon <lb/>
any one family or families and therefore God's <lb/>
hand is the more apparently seen herein to put <lb/>
this wofull woman to her and those belonging <lb/>
to her an unheard of heavie example of their <lb/>
cruelty above all others."</p>
<p>It is difficult to obtain an unprejudiced <reg orig="judg-|ment">judgment</reg> <lb/>
of Anne Hutchinson. She seems to have <lb/>
been either despised or adored. Pictures given <lb/>
by her enemies have already been presented. <lb/>
Eugene Lawrence, an ardent admirer, says: <lb/>
"Anne Hutchinson had so delicate a spiritual <lb/>
organization that the future world was ever <lb/>
more real to her than the present&mdash;wealth, <reg orig="lux-|ury">luxury</reg>, <lb/>
ease had for her no charm. She lived in <lb/>
the universe rather than in the world. The <lb/>
common joys of life, domestic ease, refined <reg orig="so-|ciety">society</reg> <lb/>
and material splendor, she cast aside with <lb/>
disdain. Truth was fairer to her than <reg orig="dia-|monds">diamonds</reg> <lb/>
and liberty of speech and thought to <lb/>
luxurious chambers and downy rest. &hellip; <lb/>
The lonely hut by Hutchinson River was her <lb/>
palace and her temple rather than the <reg orig="comfort-|able">comfortable</reg> <lb/>
dwelling she possessed in Massachusetts <lb/>
<pb n="22" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0047"/>
Bay. &hellip; Her life was as spotless as her <reg orig="doc-|trines&mdash;she">doctrines&mdash;she</reg> <lb/>
was an example of the purity she <lb/>
taught. The faithful looked upon her with <lb/>
wonder, delight, and love. An angel seemed to <lb/>
have descended upon them&mdash;a spotless spirit <lb/>
was once more found upon the earth."</p>
<p>This eulogy is of course exaggerated. She <lb/>
herself acknowledges faults of temper and of <lb/>
speech, but the few vital facts which have come <lb/>
down prove that she was fired with enthusiasm <lb/>
for God, and that she courageously and <reg orig="unceas-|ingly">unceasingly</reg>, <lb/>
if perhaps frantically and unwisely, <lb/>
poured out the truths which were in her heart. <lb/>
They also prove that her life was full of good <lb/>
deeds. Thus in her own life, she combined the <lb/>
"covenant of grace" and the "covenant of <lb/>
works." For these reasons, though the <reg orig="ques-|tions">questions</reg> <lb/>
she raised have ceased to interest, she is <lb/>
truly a heroine of religion.</p>

SUSANNAH WESLEY</hi></head>
<byline><hi rend="small-caps">by william horton foster</hi></byline>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">One</hi> day in 1701, the year before the death <lb/>
of William Third of England, Samuel <lb/>
Wesley, rector of Epworth parish, in his <reg orig="domes-|tic">domestic</reg> <lb/>
worship, voiced his customary prayer for the <lb/>
king. For thirteen years this had been his daily <lb/>
habit, and he had never noticed until this <reg orig="morn-|ing">morning</reg> <lb/>
that Susannah, his wife, did not supply the <lb/>
dutiful "Amen!" which responded to every <lb/>
other petition. When he remonstrated with <lb/>
her somewhat tartly for this breach of churchly <lb/>
decorum, he learned to his surprise that she had <lb/>
never said "Amen!" to that prayer and that she <lb/>
never would. Church-woman as she was, <reg orig="de-|fender">defender</reg> <lb/>
of Protestantism as was William of <reg orig="Or-|ange">Orange</reg>, <lb/>
she had never regarded him as the <reg orig="right-|ful">rightful</reg> <lb/>
monarch and she would never recognize him <lb/>
as king.</p>
<p>The complacent rector could hardly believe <lb/>
his ears. He remembered the year of the silent <lb/>
revolution which had placed William and Mary <lb/>
upon the throne. He remembered that day in <lb/>
the same year which had marked his marriage <lb/>
with the beautiful Susannah Annesley. All his <lb/>
married life until now had run parallel with the <lb/>
<pb n="24" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0049"/>
reign of the king. To be told that all these <lb/>
years the wife of his heart had been denying the <lb/>
very foundations of his political faith, even of <lb/>
the State itself, was indeed almost beyond <reg orig="be-|lief">belief</reg>.</p>
<p>Yet this attitude was significant of Susannah. <lb/>
For all this time, in the daily intimacy of the <lb/>
home, she had pursued her even way. If she <lb/>
could not yield technical allegiance to King <reg orig="Wil-|liam">William</reg>, <lb/>
the point was unimportant, let it pass! <lb/>
If she could not subscribe to all the details of <lb/>
her husband's political belief, she could still <lb/>
glorify the office of wife and mother. Careless <lb/>
of non-essentials, she knew the eternal realities. <lb/>
For thirteen years she had been indifferent to <lb/>
the determination of the point of doctrine <reg orig="in-|volved">involved</reg> <lb/>
in William's crowning; all these years <lb/>
she had been enacting the r&ocirc;le of wife and <lb/>
mother&mdash;the maker of a home.</p>
<p>For over forty years longer she continued the <lb/>
chief actor in this drama&mdash;of Epworth Parish <lb/>
it might well be called&mdash;and without her <reg orig="char-|acter">character</reg>, <lb/>
the play would never have been enacted. <lb/>
Here there is a touch of comedy, there a bit <lb/>
of melodrama, occasionally a hint of farce; but <lb/>
always dominant and overwhelming, the <reg orig="trag-|edy">tragedy</reg> <lb/>
of the smothering commonplace. And out <lb/>
of this drama, of which Susannah Wesley was <lb/>
the dominating figure, grew a new religious <lb/>
faith that in all the Anglo-Saxon world <reg orig="revital-|ized">revitalized</reg> <lb/>
religion.</p>
<p>January 20, 1669, in Spital Yard, a narrow <lb/>
court in London, was born Susannah Annesley, <lb/>

the youngest of twenty-five children. July 23, <lb/>
1742, in an abandoned London gun foundry, <reg orig="con-|verted">converted</reg> <lb/>
into a combination dwelling and meeting <lb/>
house for her preacher son John, Susannah <lb/>
Wesley died. The span of her life witnessed a <lb/>
new quickening of religious thought, the <reg orig="cul-|mination">culmination</reg> <lb/>
of the renaissance and the reformation <lb/>
which had gone before. It was possibly greater <lb/>
than either, for it was a renaissance <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the <reg orig="re-|formation">reformation</reg>; <lb/>
it was a new birth of the spiritual <lb/>
life of England. In this movement two names <lb/>
stand conspicuous, the two Wesleys&mdash;John, the <lb/>
organizer and founder, and Charles, the pious <lb/>
minstrel of the new life. What these two <lb/>
teachers of the new ideas of spiritual equality <lb/>
were, they owed directly and specifically to the <lb/>
counsels and training of their mother. She was <lb/>
not only the mother of the Wesleys but the <lb/>
mother of Methodism.</p>
<p>In her girlhood, Susannah witnessed the <reg orig="dy-|ing">dying</reg> <lb/>
embers of a fire of persecution of the <reg orig="non-|conformists">nonconformists</reg> <lb/>
which had burned as steadily if not <lb/>
so fiercely as any which had gone before. The <lb/>
"Act of Uniformity," of 1662, required every <lb/>
clergyman to declare his "unfeigned assent to <lb/>
all and everything contained and prescribed in <lb/>
the Book of Common Prayer." On St. <reg orig="Barthol-|omew's">Bartholomew's</reg> <lb/>
day, when the act went into effect, over <lb/>
two thousand ministers bade farewell to their <lb/>
weeping congregations. Exemplary in their <lb/>
lives, educated and eloquent, they were "guilty <lb/>
of no crime, save that they did not dare to <lb/>
worship God according to other men's <reg orig="con-|sciences">consciences</reg>!" <lb/>
<pb n="26" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0053"/>
They were forbidden to live within <lb/>
five miles of any place where they had <lb/>
preached; they were forbidden to teach any <lb/>
school, public or private. Nor were they the <lb/>
only sufferers. Worshipers who attended any <lb/>
other than the established form or even received <lb/>
the dissenting ministers in their homes were <lb/>
heavily fined or imprisoned or transported. <lb/>
The enforcement of the acts was committed to <lb/>
the king's soldiery; the prisons and even the <lb/>
gallows were crowded with those who took <reg orig="coun-|sel">counsel</reg> <lb/>
alone with their conscience. Over five <reg orig="thou-|sand">thousand</reg>, <lb/>
it is said, died in prison. The other St. <lb/>
Bartholomew's day exacted scarcely a heavier <lb/>
toll.</p>
<p>In such an England, was Susannah Annesley <lb/>
born. To such steadfastness and courage was <lb/>
she as well as her future husband, Samuel <reg orig="Wes-|ley">Wesley</reg>, <lb/>
an heir. For not only was Samuel <reg orig="Annes-|ley">Annesley</reg>, <lb/>
her father, driven by the Act from the <lb/>
wealthy living of St. Giles in London, but <reg orig="Sam-|uel">Samuel</reg> <lb/>
Wesley's father, John Westley&mdash;Samuel <lb/>
was the first to spell his name without the <lb/>
t&mdash;was forced to leave the parish of <reg orig="Whit-|church">Whitchurch</reg>, <lb/>
a little village of Dorsetshire. The <reg orig="dig-|nified">dignified</reg> <lb/>
London rector only his friends among the <lb/>
nobility saved from physical violence. Not <lb/>
more resolute in his convictions but more <reg orig="mili-|tant">militant</reg> <lb/>
in his faith, John Westley, however, knew <lb/>
no peace after the fateful twenty-third of <lb/>
August. He was driven from his lowly pulpit <lb/>
at Whitchurch; successive orders forced him <lb/>
from village to village. His body was too frail <lb/>
<pb n="27" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0054"/>
long to withstand this grim religious warfare, <lb/>
and when he was but a young man he died. His <lb/>
father, Bartholomew, much more violent in <lb/>
speech and action than his son, easily withstood <lb/>
the fierce struggle brought about by <reg orig="persecu-|tion">persecution</reg>, <lb/>
but was crushed by John's death and <reg orig="sur-|vived">survived</reg> <lb/>
him only a short time.</p>
<p>Such was the heritage which met and blended <lb/>
in the lives of Susannah Annesley and Samuel <lb/>
Wesley. Yet strangely enough the two lines <lb/>
of descent were apparently reversed. Samuel <lb/>
Annesley seems to have been reproduced in <lb/>
Samuel Wesley, while all the grim <reg orig="steadfast-|ness">steadfastness</reg> <lb/>
of the Westleys&mdash;father and son&mdash;seems <lb/>
to have been transmuted into a still finer metal <lb/>
in the resolute soul of Susannah.</p>
<p>In November, 1662, a few months after his <lb/>
father John Westley had been ejected from <lb/>
Whitchurch, Samuel Wesley was born. Because <lb/>
of the death of his father before the lad was <lb/>
ready for the university, dissenting friends <lb/>
cared for his education. For five years, he met <lb/>
in daily intimacy the best men of the new creed. <lb/>
Always ready of wit and agile in mind, he had a <lb/>
trick for rhyme and lampoon; his varied talents <lb/>
he utilized, not always too delicately, in the <reg orig="con-|troversial">controversial</reg> <lb/>
literature of the day. His <reg orig="counsel-|ors">counselors</reg> <lb/>
regarded him as one of the most hopeful <lb/>
of the future ministers of their faith although <lb/>
he had no particularly deep experiences of his <lb/>
own and was content passively to take his <reg orig="the-|ology">theology</reg> <lb/>
with his instruction from his father's <lb/>
friends.</p>
<pb n="28" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0055"/>
<p>After five years or so, however, there was a <lb/>
silent revolution in Samuel Wesley's life as <lb/>
vital to him as was the revolution of 1688 to the <lb/>
English nation. The causes of this complete <lb/>
overturn of his religious beliefs are somewhat <lb/>
obscure, but it is certain that the young girl, <lb/>
afterwards his wife, profoundly influenced him. <lb/>
After the penalties of the Act of Uniformity <lb/>
had been suspended in 1672, Dr. Annesley took <lb/>
the ministry of a dissenting church in London. <lb/>
His hospitable door welcomed all who knocked, <lb/>
and they were many; for not only was the good <lb/>
doctor genial and hearty but his flock numbered <lb/>
a full score of attractive daughters. Young <lb/>
Samuel was a favorite guest. He came and <lb/>
came again, perhaps because he found the <lb/>
clergyman's conversation edifying or perhaps <lb/>
because the beautiful Susannah was a delightful <lb/>
companion. One constant topic of conversation <lb/>
was the all-absorbing question of religious <reg orig="con-|formity">conformity</reg>. <lb/>
Together they came to doubt the <lb/>
righteousness of the dissension, and together <lb/>
they abandoned the creed of their fathers and <lb/>
returned to the church of authority.</p>
<p>When the young dissenter came to his new <lb/>
beliefs, he allowed no time for his courage to <lb/>
ooze away. To avoid the reproaches of his <lb/>
relatives and friends, he arose early one August <lb/>
morning, and trudged afoot to Oxford there to <lb/>
prepare for the regular ministry. His leaving <lb/>
was not dishonorable, however; from a legacy <lb/>
he repaid the loans of his father's friends and <lb/>
of necessity entered Exeter College as a <reg orig="servi-|tor">servitor</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="29" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0056"/>
with but a few shillings in his pocket. <lb/>
Formerly his life had been comfortable but now <lb/>
to his lot fell the blacking of boots, the serving <lb/>
of meals and the menial services of a valet. <lb/>
With such work he earned his keep and, aided <lb/>
by his literary labors, he managed to exist, so <lb/>
well, in fact, that five years later when he took <lb/>
his final degree he was eight pounds richer than <lb/>
when he entered. He hastened at once to <reg orig="Lon-|don">London</reg>, <lb/>
was ordained a deacon and, later, priest. <lb/>
The year 1688 or possibly 1689, saw him settled <lb/>
as a curate, and married to his young girl friend <lb/>
Susannah, now just turned eighteen.</p>
<p>While her lover was doing the work of a <reg orig="serv-|ant">servant</reg> <lb/>
in Oxford, Susannah was growing up <lb/>
among cultured companions. In all minds, <reg orig="ec-|clesiastical">ecclesiastical</reg> <lb/>
discussions held first place. "<reg orig="Be-|fore">Before</reg> <lb/>
I was full thirteen," Susannah says, "I <lb/>
had drawn up an account of the whole <reg orig="transac-|tion">transaction</reg>, <lb/>
under which I had included the main of <lb/>
the controversy between them &lsqb;the dissenters&rsqb; <lb/>
and the Established Church, as far as it had <lb/>
come to my knowledge." She was "early <reg orig="ini-|tiated">initiated</reg> <lb/>
and instructed in the first principles of <lb/>
the Christian religion," and had a "good <reg orig="ex-|ample">example</reg> <lb/>
in parents, and in several of the family." <lb/>
In girlhood she "received from the heart the <lb/>
form of doctrine" from her father's lips. <lb/>
When asked by one of her children for a rule <lb/>
as to diversions she replied that her own rule <lb/>
as a girl was never to spend more time per day <lb/>
in worldly pleasures than she was willing to <lb/>
spend in private devotions.</p>
<pb n="30" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0057"/>
<p>With all her interest in religious dogma, <reg orig="how-|ever">however</reg>, <lb/>
Susannah was a normal, hearty English <lb/>
girl. All twenty of the Annesley girls were <lb/>
fun-loving and comely. Her sister Judith was <lb/>
painted by Sir Peter Lely, and Elizabeth's <lb/>
charm of face and figure have been minutely <lb/>
told. Yet one who knew them well says: <lb/>
"Beautiful as Miss Elizabeth Annesley <reg orig="ap-|pears">appears</reg>, <lb/>
she was far from being as beautiful as <lb/>
Mrs. Wesley." Moreover, Susannah early <lb/>
showed that all-embracing motherliness that <lb/>
later enabled her to sustain her husband and <lb/>
family under the most trying circumstances and <lb/>
to build all three of her clergyman-sons into <lb/>
greatness. In a letter she says: "What then <lb/>
is love? or how shall we describe its strange <lb/>
mysterious essence? It is&mdash;I do not know <lb/>
what! A powerful something! Source of our <lb/>
joy and grief! Felt and experienced by every <lb/>
one, and yet unknown to all! Nor shall we ever <lb/>
comprehend what it is, till we are united to our <lb/>
First Principle, and there read its wondrous <lb/>
nature in the clear mirror of uncreated Love; <lb/>
till which time it is best to rest satisfied with <lb/>
such apprehensions of its essence as we can <reg orig="col-|lect">collect</reg> <lb/>
from our observations of its effects and <lb/>
properties; for other knowledge of it in our <lb/>
present state is too high and too wonderful for <lb/>
us; neither can we attain unto it." Her own <lb/>
wife-love and mother-love accomplished the <lb/>
wonder of reawakening the religious life of the <lb/>
English speaking people because, built upon the <lb/>
foundation of a trained mind and infinite <reg orig="pa-|tience">patience</reg>, <lb/>
<pb n="31" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0058"/>
it was all-embracing and united to the <lb/>
great "First Principle."</p>
<p>For two years after the marriage, the young <lb/>
curate and his bride lived in lodgings in <reg orig="Lon-|don">London</reg>. <lb/>
Here the first child, Samuel, was born. <lb/>
Mrs. Wesley managed the small income so well <lb/>
that the family kept out of debt. As an author <lb/>
the young husband more than fulfilled the <lb/>
promise of his earlier years; he was long the <lb/>
chief contributor to the <hi rend="italic">Athenian Gazette</hi> which <lb/>
numbered among its writers many of the first <lb/>
men of the nation&mdash;DeFoe and Swift among <lb/>
others. Because he added both to his <reg orig="reputa-|tion">reputation</reg> <lb/>
and his income, he fixed upon himself the <lb/>
writing habit from which he never recovered! <lb/>
More unfortunately still, he never overcame his <lb/>
passion for versifying; upon the slightest <reg orig="occa-|sion">occasion</reg> <lb/>
he fell into fluent rhyme.</p>
<p>His preliminary service as a curate in <reg orig="Lon-|don">London</reg> <lb/>
lasted until 1690 when he received the <reg orig="rec-|tory">rectory</reg> <lb/>
of South Ormsby, a little village in <reg orig="Lincoln-|shire">Lincolnshire</reg>. <lb/>
This first preferment began a life-long <lb/>
struggle for advancement. A rector had no <lb/>
way of bettering his condition except to make <lb/>
friends with the members of the nobility who <lb/>
had the rectorates as absolute gifts. Samuel <lb/>
Wesley's was no mean spirit but he joined with <lb/>
the rest in soliciting the favor of his superiors <lb/>
in rank. For forty years he was hoping against <lb/>
hope that My Lord This or My Lady That would <lb/>
help him to a more lucrative parish. Poems <lb/>
were his chief method of approach, and as <reg orig="regu-|larly">regularly</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="32" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0059"/>
as a new poem appeared he hopefully <lb/>
dedicated it to some new patron. Still he <lb/>
stayed on in his modest rectory, in his own <lb/>
words "wasting in sighs the uncomfortable <lb/>
day." His meter, however, is no more accurate <lb/>
than the fact, for he wasted no time in sighs <lb/>
or otherwise. He did his daily task of <reg orig="admoni-|tion">admonition</reg> <lb/>
and counsel. Indeed his sense of duty was <lb/>
so rigid that it mattered little to him upon whom <lb/>
the earned reproof fell. This thorough-going <lb/>
honesty always stood in the way of his material <lb/>
progress. The rectorate of South Ormsby he <lb/>
lost because he would not wink at the vices of <lb/>
the man who had the gift of the living. At <reg orig="an-|other">another</reg> <lb/>
time, he condemned a wealthy offender to <lb/>
stand for three successive Sabbaths on the damp <lb/>
mud floor in the center of the church, without <lb/>
shoes or stockings, bareheaded, wrapped in a <lb/>
white sheet, doing penance. A poorer <reg orig="par-|ishioner">parishioner</reg> <lb/>
who had been guilty of the same <reg orig="of-|fense">offense</reg> <lb/>
he let off with a fine and then paid the <lb/>
fine himself.</p>
<p>For seven years the family lived in South <lb/>
Ormsby. The church itself was attractive <lb/>
enough but the rectory "a mean hut composed <lb/>
of reeds and clay." Here there were fifty <lb/>
pounds a year to live upon "and one child <reg orig="addi-|tional">additional</reg> <lb/>
per annum." Yet no one complained. <lb/>
Each newcomer was welcomed, the thrifty wife <lb/>
made a little food fill many mouths, and the <lb/>
rector wrote poems and pamphlets more busily <lb/>
than ever. His "Life of Christ," a metrical <lb/>
work of some nine thousand lines, a mingled <lb/>
<pb n="33" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0060"/>
work of genius and dullness, helped keep the <lb/>
wolf from the door.</p>
<p>In all these years, as well as the years that <lb/>
were to follow, his wife had need of all her <lb/>
thrift. Her life from marriage to death is a <lb/>
constant struggle against weakness and <reg orig="pov-|erty">poverty</reg>. <lb/>
One disaster followed another so drearily <lb/>
that a less thoroughly equipped woman would <lb/>
soon have despaired. The hourly tragedy of <lb/>
the lack of food and clothing, the burden of an <lb/>
ever increasing family of children&mdash;her <reg orig="nine-|teen">nineteen</reg> <lb/>
were all born within a period of twenty <lb/>
years&mdash;wrecked neither her courage nor her <lb/>
resourcefulness. Her meager income rivals <lb/>
the widow's cruse of oil. Possibly a later <reg orig="in-|spired">inspired</reg> <lb/>
historian will see the daily food afforded <lb/>
Susannah as clearly given from God as was the <lb/>
oil of the widow of Zarephath.</p>
<p>This courage is dominant throughout her life. <lb/>
She never gave up; she never yielded even to <lb/>
actual disease. She did the work to be done, no <lb/>
matter what her condition of body or mind. <lb/>
Her son John wrote long afterward of the calm <lb/>
serenity with which his mother "transacted <lb/>
business, wrote letters, and conversed, <reg orig="sur-|rounded">surrounded</reg> <lb/>
by her thirteen children." She was a <lb/>
quietly practical woman who, having much to do, <lb/>
found time to do everything by dint of <reg orig="methodi-|cal">methodical</reg> <lb/>
industry. Yet while she was ordering her <lb/>
kitchen, she was training her children. Their <lb/>
times of going to rest, rising in the morning, <lb/>
dressing, eating, learning, and exercising, she <lb/>
managed by rule, which was never suffered to <lb/>
<pb n="34" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0061"/>
be broken, unless in case of sickness. From the <lb/>
fifth year of Samuel's life to the completion of <lb/>
the home education of Kezia, her nineteenth <lb/>
and last child, she enforced a daily routine <lb/>
which made the home an actual school. Six <lb/>
hours a day for twenty years, she taught her <lb/>
children and taught them so well that they <lb/>
were all really educated. They were brought <lb/>
to a "regular course of sleeping" by laying <lb/>
them in their cradle awake, rocking them to <lb/>
sleep, and constantly rocking them until they <lb/>
awakened. "When turned a year old, they were <lb/>
taught to fear the rod, and to cry softly, by <lb/>
which means they escaped abundance of <reg orig="correc-|tion">correction</reg> <lb/>
which they might otherwise have had." <lb/>
"As soon as they were grown pretty strong, <lb/>
they were confined to three meals a day." <lb/>
They were allowed to eat and drink as much as <lb/>
they would, but not to call for anything. "If <lb/>
they wanted aught they whispered to the maid <lb/>
who attended them who came and spoke to me." <lb/>
"If they asked aught of the servants in the <lb/>
kitchen they were certainly beat, and the <reg orig="serv-|ants">servants</reg> <lb/>
severely reprimanded."</p>
<p>Her system of moral instruction was equally <lb/>
definite. "I take such a proportion of time," <lb/>
she writes, "as I can best spare every night to <lb/>
discourse with each child by itself, on something <lb/>
that relates to its principal concerns. On <reg orig="Mon-|day">Monday</reg>, <lb/>
I talk with Molly; on Tuesday, with Hetty; <lb/>
Wednesday, with Nancy; Thursday, with <lb/>
Jacky; Friday, with Patty; Saturday, with <lb/>
<pb n="35" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0062"/>
Charles; and with Emilia and Sukey together <lb/>
on Sunday."</p>
<p>To form their minds aright, she considered <lb/>
her first task to be to "conquer their will and <lb/>
bring them to an obedient temper. To inform <lb/>
the understanding is a work of time, and must <lb/>
with children proceed by slow degrees as they <lb/>
are able to bear it; but the subjecting the will <lb/>
is a thing that must be done at once and the <lb/>
sooner the better."</p>
<p>In the success of her home school, patience <lb/>
was the chief ingredient. When the rector <lb/>
once visited the schoolroom, he observed his <lb/>
school-mistress wife repeat one statement to <lb/>
one of her children twenty times.</p>
<p>"I wonder at your patience; you have told <lb/>
that child twenty times the same thing."</p>
<p>"If I had satisfied myself by mentioning it <lb/>
only nineteen times, I should have lost all my <lb/>
labor," she replied. "It was the twentieth <lb/>
time that crowned it."</p>
<p>Notwithstanding both system and patience, <lb/>
there were difficulties in the ordering of the <lb/>
school-household. Jacky in particular was <lb/>
stubborn. Before assenting to anything, he <lb/>
would insist that it be reasoned out to his <reg orig="satis-|faction">satisfaction</reg>. <lb/>
Charles, less than five years younger, <lb/>
was frail from his birth; but once fairly started <lb/>
into boyhood, his lively daring caused his <lb/>
mother endless anxiety for both his physical <lb/>
and spiritual well-being. The thought of <reg orig="to-|day">today</reg> <lb/>
does not agree to all of her pedagogic <reg orig="pre-|cepts">precepts</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="36" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0063"/>
but it does credit her thoroughness, her <lb/>
conscientiousness, and above all, her devotion <lb/>
to her ideals of duty. Although many of her <lb/>
theories were harsh they were softened in <reg orig="prac-|tice">practice</reg>. <lb/>
Each child from Samuel to Kezia <reg orig="ac-|corded">accorded</reg> <lb/>
her a devotion that could not have been <lb/>
given her had she not been essentially gentle <lb/>
in soul. A rivalry existed among the daughters <lb/>
as to who was the mother's favorite, and to <lb/>
Martha was generally given that honor. She <lb/>
replied: "What my sisters call partiality was <lb/>
what they might all have enjoyed if they had <lb/>
wished it; which was permission to sit in my <lb/>
mother's chamber when discouraged, to listen <lb/>
to her conversation with others and to hear her <lb/>
remarks on things and books out of school <lb/>
hours."</p>
<p>Mrs. Wesley's education of her children was <lb/>
not a purely juvenile task, undertaken <reg orig="prepara-|tory">preparatory</reg> <lb/>
to the work of the schoolmaster who might <lb/>
later succeed her. She conceived her duty <reg orig="to-|ward">toward</reg> <lb/>
each child as stretching from birth until <lb/>
death. With constant counsel, she followed her <lb/>
sons' courses through college and into the <reg orig="min-|istry">ministry</reg>. <lb/>
Her advice was not simply on questions <lb/>
of personal conduct but on questions arising out <lb/>
of their studies and work. To John she wrote <lb/>
while he was at Oxford: "Dear Jacky:&mdash;I was <lb/>
glad to hear you got safe to Oxford, and would <lb/>
have told you so sooner had I been at liberty <lb/>
from pain of body, and other severer trials not <lb/>
convenient to mention. &hellip; Our nature is frail; <lb/>
our passions strong; our wills biased; and our <lb/>
<pb n="37" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0064"/>
security, generally speaking, consists much <lb/>
more certainly in avoiding great temptations <lb/>
than in conquering them. &hellip; Our Lord <reg orig="di-|rected">directed</reg> <lb/>
his disciples when they were persecuted <lb/>
in one city to flee into another; and they who <lb/>
refuse to do it when it is in their power, lead <lb/>
themselves into temptation and tempt God." <lb/>
Her devotion took not the form alone of <reg orig="endear-|ments&mdash;although">endearments&mdash;although</reg> <lb/>
those intimate touches abound <lb/>
&mdash;but a brooding watchfulness that never <reg orig="re-|laxed">relaxed</reg>. <lb/>
In a letter to Susannah her daughter <lb/>
she starts thus: "Dear Sukey,&mdash;Since our <reg orig="mis-|fortunes">misfortunes</reg> <lb/>
have separated us from each other, <lb/>
and we can no longer enjoy the opportunities <lb/>
we once had of conversing together, I can no <lb/>
other way discharge the duty of a parent, or <lb/>
comply with my inclination of doing you all the <lb/>
good I can, but by writing. You know very <lb/>
well how I love you. I love your body; and <lb/>
do earnestly beseech almighty God to bless it <lb/>
with health and all things necessary for its <lb/>
comfort and support in this world."</p>
<p>She had, indeed, a passion for motherhood! <lb/>
The motherhood which held the world's first <lb/>
born babe in its arms and voiced the cry which <lb/>
has sung in every other mother's heart, "I have <lb/>
gotten me a man child from the Lord!" was <lb/>
hers. The motherhood which keeps all these <lb/>
things and ponders them in her heart, was hers. <lb/>
The universal motherhood which runs from age <lb/>
to age, was hers. To Eve and Mary and in like <lb/>
degree to every mother everywhere came the <lb/>
divinest thing ever revealed&mdash;motherhood. And <lb/>
<pb n="38" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0065"/>
in Susannah Wesley it shone bright. It <reg orig="dedi-|cated">dedicated</reg> <lb/>
to the service of God her firstborn before <lb/>
he had seen the light. It took her life and <lb/>
offered it a daily recurring sacrifice to the <reg orig="pro-|saic">prosaic</reg> <lb/>
duties of the home.</p>
<p>While the Wesleys lived at South Ormsby, <lb/>
Dr. Annesley, the father of Mrs. Wesley, died. <lb/>
Her feeling toward him was one of peculiar <reg orig="de-|votion">devotion</reg> <lb/>
and there was an intimacy in their <reg orig="rela-|tionship">relationship</reg> <lb/>
which not even her change of belief <lb/>
had affected. Her intense affection survived <lb/>
his death with scarcely diminished ardor. As <lb/>
long as she lived, he had to her mind but changed <lb/>
his outward form, and she was fully persuaded <lb/>
that he was constantly near her and conversing <lb/>
with her. This deep sense of an almost literal <lb/>
"communion of saints" she transmitted to her <lb/>
sons, and John and Charles both repeatedly <reg orig="as-|serted">asserted</reg> <lb/>
their belief in the nearness of the <reg orig="de-|parted">departed</reg>.</p>
<p>This feeling was perhaps strengthened by <reg orig="cer-|tain">certain</reg> <lb/>
peculiar happenings in the rectory at <reg orig="Ep-|worth">Epworth</reg>, <lb/>
the Wesleys' later home. For years <lb/>
they heard mysterious noises and weird <reg orig="rap-|pings">rappings</reg> <lb/>
which became so frequent that the ghostly <lb/>
visitant assumed in the household a place secure <lb/>
if not welcome and answered to the name Old <lb/>
Jeffrey given him by the children. He seemed <lb/>
to be attached to certain of the household rather <lb/>
than to others and was particularly devoted to <lb/>
Mrs. Wesley. The four girls, Emilia, <reg orig="Susan-|nah">Susannah</reg>, <lb/>
Mehetabel, and Anne, were the first in the <lb/>
family who observed Jeffrey's attentions, and <lb/>
<pb n="39" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0066"/>
when they reported them to their parents, the <lb/>
father smiled, thinking it all a trick, and the <lb/>
practical mother at once thought of rats. A <lb/>
little later both parents were convinced of the <lb/>
genuineness of the manifestations. None of the <lb/>
rector's incantations worried the ghost but he <lb/>
paid instant obedience to Mrs. Wesley's <reg orig="re-|quest">request</reg> <lb/>
not to disturb her from five to six in the <lb/>
morning. To the children Old Jeffrey was a <lb/>
great joke. They enjoyed each new experience <lb/>
and eagerly awaited each new prank of their <lb/>
thoroughly disreputable guest. To the rector <lb/>
Old Jeffrey was a puzzling problem; he was <reg orig="de-|cidedly">decidedly</reg> <lb/>
a Jacobite in politics and expressed a <lb/>
violent antipathy to prayers for the reigning <lb/>
monarch.</p>
<p>Whatever may have been the explanation of <lb/>
Old Jeffrey, the whole family was convinced of <lb/>
his reality. Believing strongly in buried <reg orig="trea-|sure">treasure</reg>, <lb/>
practical Samuel wrote from school <reg orig="ad-|vising">advising</reg> <lb/>
digging in the garden at the point where <lb/>
Jeffrey had appeared. John and Charles <lb/>
joined their mother in thinking him to be a <lb/>
comfortable messenger from the dead. In <reg orig="con-|nection">connection</reg> <lb/>
with Old Jeffrey, Mrs. Wesley said, "I <lb/>
am rather inclined to think there would be <reg orig="fre-|quent">frequent</reg> <lb/>
intercourse between good spirits and <lb/>
us, did not our deep lapse into sensuality <reg orig="pre-|vent">prevent</reg> <lb/>
it." This mysticism colored much of her <lb/>
thought, and in varying forms and degrees gave <lb/>
to John and Charles new points of view which <lb/>
in turn affected their thought and largely <reg orig="in-|fluenced">influenced</reg> <lb/>
the doctrines of the sect they founded.</p>
<pb n="40" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0067"/>
<p>It was in 1697 that the rectory of Epworth <lb/>
was conferred upon Samuel Wesley, directly <lb/>
from the Crown. It was probably given him at <lb/>
the request of Queen Mary, to whom he had <lb/>
dedicated his metrical <hi rend="italic">Life of Christ</hi>. The <reg orig="par-|sonage">parsonage</reg> <lb/>
itself consisted of "five baies, built all <lb/>
of timber and plaister, and covered all with <lb/>
straw thache, the whole building being contrived <lb/>
into three stories, and disposed into seven chief <lb/>
rooms; namely, a kitchinge, a hall, a parlor, a <lb/>
butterie, and three large upper rooms; besydes <lb/>
some others of common use; and also a little <lb/>
garden impailed, between the stone wall and the <lb/>
south." The "home-stall or scite of the <reg orig="par-|sonage">parsonage</reg> <lb/>
&hellip;" contained "by estimation, three <lb/>
acres." There "was one barn of six baies, <lb/>
built all of timber and clay walls, and covered <lb/>
with straw thache; and outshotts about it, and <lb/>
free house therebye." Then came "one <reg orig="dove-|coate">dove-coate</reg> <lb/>
of timber and plaister," covered with the <lb/>
usual "straw thache" and finally one "<reg orig="hemp-|kiln">hemp-kiln</reg>, <lb/>
that hath been useaelie occupied for the <lb/>
parsonage ground, adjoyning upon the south." <lb/>
The living, nominally worth some two hundred <lb/>
pounds a year, would probably have supported <lb/>
the Wesleys in comfort had not the poetical <lb/>
rector tried to farm.</p>
<p>Dr. Wesley's poetry occasionally produced <lb/>
revenue; but the qualities necessary to poetry <lb/>
stood in the way of agricultural success. Other <lb/>
rectors had always rented the clerical lands at <lb/>
Epworth but Dr. Wesley insisted upon <reg orig="cultivat-|ing">cultivating</reg> <lb/>
his fields himself. He borrowed the capital <lb/>
<pb n="41" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0068"/>
necessary for stock and equipment and bravely <lb/>
set out as a gentleman farmer. With a fine <lb/>
flush of poetical enthusiasm he saw a vision of <lb/>
rural peace and comfort, of his spiritual and <lb/>
literary labors set off against a serene <reg orig="back-|ground">background</reg> <lb/>
of pleasant fields and bounteous <reg orig="har-|vests">harvests</reg>, <lb/>
the fruits of his own honest industry. <lb/>
Though uncomplaining as always, Mrs. Wesley <lb/>
shrank from the prospect. "He is not fit for <lb/>
worldly business," wrote her brother on one <reg orig="oc-|casion">occasion</reg>. <lb/>
"That I assent to," she replied, "and <lb/>
must own I was mistaken when I did think him <lb/>
fit for it. My own experience hath since <reg orig="con-|vinced">convinced</reg> <lb/>
me that he is one of those who, our <lb/>
Savior saith, 'are not so wise in their <reg orig="genera-|tion">generation</reg> <lb/>
as the children of this world.'"</p>
<p>With these rosy hopes but with such sad lack <lb/>
of needed training&mdash;he had no knowledge of <lb/>
farming other than the verse-loving student <lb/>
would gain in a London lodging&mdash;did Samuel <lb/>
Wesley enter upon his new life at Epworth. <lb/>
The annual interest charge he incurred proved <lb/>
a heavy tax and from his burden of debt he <lb/>
never escaped. The house, in comparison with <lb/>
the one at South Ormsby, was a palace, and life <lb/>
would have been comfortable indeed had the <lb/>
financial stress been a little lighter. Yet the <lb/>
one upon whom the burden fell the heaviest&mdash; <lb/>
Susannah Wesley&mdash;did her day's work without <lb/>
complaint. In the many privations she endured <lb/>
she saw but the disciplines which made for her <lb/>
spiritual development. Once in her diary she <lb/>
records: "Though man is born to trouble, yet <lb/>
<pb n="42" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0069"/>
I believe there is scarce a man to be found upon <lb/>
earth but, take the whole course of his life, hath <lb/>
more mercies than afflictions, and much more <lb/>
pleasure than pain. I am sure it has been so in <lb/>
my case. &hellip; And these very sufferings have, <lb/>
by the blessing of God, been of excellent use, and <lb/>
proved the most proper means of reclaiming <lb/>
me from a vain conversation; insomuch that I <lb/>
cannot say I had better have been without this <lb/>
affliction, this disease, this loss, want, contempt <lb/>
or reproach. All my sufferings, by the <reg orig="admir-|able">admirable</reg> <lb/>
management of Omnipotent Goodness, have <lb/>
concurred to promote my spiritual and eternal <lb/>
good. &hellip; Glory be to Thee, O Lord!"</p>
<p>For over forty years the rectory at Epworth <lb/>
was her home. It would be a veritable <reg orig="cata-|logue">catalogue</reg> <lb/>
of ships to recount the regular, almost <lb/>
daily hardships through which she passed.</p>
<p>"Tell me, Mrs. Wesley," Archbishop Sharp <lb/>
once asked, "whether you ever really wanted <lb/>
bread?" "My Lord," she replied, "I will <lb/>
freely own to your Grace that, strictly <reg orig="speak-|ing">speaking</reg>, <lb/>
I never did want bread; but I had so <lb/>
much care to get it before it was eat, and to <lb/>
pay for it after, as has often made it very <reg orig="un-|pleasant">unpleasant</reg> <lb/>
to me; and I think to have bread on <lb/>
such terms is the next degree of wretchedness <lb/>
to having none at all." In 1701 when <reg orig="Susan-|nah">Susannah</reg> <lb/>
and the rector pooled their funds to send <lb/>
for coals, all they could muster was five <reg orig="shil-|lings">shillings</reg>. <lb/>
Twenty-five years later they had but <lb/>
five pounds for the family support from <reg orig="May-|day">Mayday</reg> <lb/>
until after harvest. Emilia, the oldest <lb/>
<pb n="43" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0070"/>
daughter, her great comfort, knew better than <lb/>
anyone else what pains her mother had to bear. <lb/>
She many times declared her mother's weakness <lb/>
and poor health came not only from her ever <lb/>
recurring maternity but as much from the <lb/>
simple lack of proper food and clothing. Yet <lb/>
the courage of the mother never faltered.</p>
<p>The continual charities of the open-hearted <lb/>
rector were another reason why Mrs. Wesley <lb/>
needed her abounding patience. Whether the <lb/>
Wesleys themselves had enough to eat or not <lb/>
the rector always gave freely of his time and <lb/>
means to the service of others. For seven <reg orig="suc-|cessive">successive</reg> <lb/>
winters he journeyed to the convocations <lb/>
of his church in London as the representative <lb/>
of the clergy of his diocese. He was expected <lb/>
in return for this honor, if honor it was, to <lb/>
pay his own expenses.</p>
<p>Nor was poverty alone all the family had to <lb/>
bear. Samuel Wesley was a pronounced Tory. <lb/>
His uncompromising morality had already <reg orig="al-|ienated">alienated</reg> <lb/>
some of his most influential <reg orig="parishion-|ers">parishioners</reg>; <lb/>
he had visited severe punishment upon <reg orig="of-|fenses">offenses</reg> <lb/>
too often condoned by a softer virtue. <lb/>
He was none too popular at the best. When the <lb/>
Whigs came into control of the government <lb/>
they speedily cut off several of his few <reg orig="perqui-|sites">perquisites</reg>, <lb/>
and all the accumulated rancor of his <lb/>
enemies seized this occasion for attack. He was <lb/>
insulted; he was robbed of his due in tithes and <lb/>
revenues; twice he suffered from the <reg orig="incendi-|ary">incendiary</reg>; <lb/>
mobs surrounded his house and with drums <lb/>
and guns made night hideous, and at last he <lb/>
<pb n="44" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0071"/>
was arrested for a debt of thirty pounds and <lb/>
thrown into the debtors' prison of Lincoln <lb/>
castle. Here he was held for over three months <lb/>
until his friends could arrange his debts and <lb/>
effect his release. In all the attacks upon him, <lb/>
he never forgot his personal dignity nor his <lb/>
dignity as an ambassador of heaven, but no <lb/>
sooner was he within the walls of the debtors' <lb/>
prison&mdash;a debtors' jail of the England of the <lb/>
eighteenth century, be it remembered!&mdash;than he <lb/>
exclaimed: "Now I am at rest, for I am come to <lb/>
the haven where I've long expected to be! &hellip; <lb/>
A jail is a paradise in comparison of the life <lb/>
I led before I came hither." He realized the <lb/>
seriousness of his predicament but like many <lb/>
another man who has long struggled under an <lb/>
impending calamity, he welcomed the actual <lb/>
blow as more endurable than the suspense. "I <lb/>
hope to rise again, as I have always done when <lb/>
at the lowest," he writes; "and I think I can <lb/>
not be much lower now." His first thought <lb/>
after he entered his cell, was for his wife and <lb/>
children; his next for the unfortunate poor <lb/>
about him. He saw in his imprisonment an <reg orig="op-|portunity">opportunity</reg> <lb/>
for usefulness. Only two days after <lb/>
his arrival he writes: "I don't despair of <reg orig="do-|ing">doing</reg> <lb/>
some good here&mdash;and so long I sha'n't quite <lb/>
lose the end of living&mdash;and it may be do more <lb/>
in this new parish than in my old one; for I <lb/>
have leave to read prayers every morning and <lb/>
evening here in the prison and to preach once <lb/>
a Sunday. I am getting acquainted with my <lb/>
brother jail birds as fast as I can."</p>
<pb n="45" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0072"/>
<p>The rector had good reason to worry about <lb/>
his family at home. Life in the parsonage was <lb/>
one continual struggle. Susannah's dairy was <lb/>
the sole support, and one night an enemy of the <lb/>
vicar's stabbed her cows. Her chief solicitude, <lb/>
however, was lest her husband might be in <lb/>
greater straits for food than were she and the <lb/>
children. All she could do was to send him her <lb/>
wedding ring, the only jewelry she had, but he <lb/>
promptly returned it.</p>
<p>After his release, his friends advised him to <lb/>
leave Epworth. He refused. These are his <lb/>
reasons, as he gave them to the Archbishop of <lb/>
York: "I confess I am not of that mind, <reg orig="be-|cause">because</reg> <lb/>
I may yet do some good there, and 'tis <lb/>
like a coward to desert my post because the <lb/>
enemy fire thick upon me. They have only <lb/>
wounded me yet, and, I believe, can't kill me." <lb/>
Upon his return the enemy fired upon him more <lb/>
thickly than ever. The climax came when his <lb/>
house was burned to the ground and the family <lb/>
but barely escaped with their lives.</p>
<p>This last fire at Epworth&mdash;this was the second <lb/>
attempt&mdash;is to every Methodist the pillar of <lb/>
fire which speaks a special providence for his <lb/>
church. For John Wesley, then a young child, <lb/>
was left for lost in the building after his <reg orig="ago-|nized">agonized</reg> <lb/>
father had been repeatedly beaten back by <lb/>
the flames. As the rector, kneeling in prayer <lb/>
in an outer passage, commended to God the soul <lb/>
of the lad, whom he thought surely doomed, <lb/>
kindly neighbors formed a human pyramid <lb/>
which was the means of the lad's rescue. To <lb/>
<pb n="46" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0073"/>
John, the mystic, that prayer always seemed <lb/>
to be the divine seal on a peculiar and exalted <lb/>
mission for which he had been miraculously <reg orig="pre-|served">preserved</reg>. <lb/>
His tombstone he ordered to be <reg orig="in-|scribed">inscribed</reg>, <lb/>
"A brand plucked out of the burning." <lb/>
In the rescue his mother saw an equal miracle. <lb/>
She encouraged John's belief in his great <reg orig="des-|tiny">destiny</reg> <lb/>
and fostered his high hope. "What shall <lb/>
I render unto the Lord for his mercies? The <lb/>
little unworthy praise that I can offer is so mean <lb/>
and contemptible an offering, that I am even <lb/>
ashamed to tender it. But, Lord, accept it for <lb/>
the sake of Christ, and pardon the deficiency of <lb/>
the sacrifice. I would offer thee myself, and all <lb/>
that thou hast given me; and I would resolve <lb/>
&mdash;O give me grace to do it!&mdash;that the residue of <lb/>
my life shall be all devoted to thy service. And <lb/>
I do intend to be more particularly careful of <lb/>
the soul of this child, that thou hast so <reg orig="merci-|fully">mercifully</reg> <lb/>
provided for, than ever I have been; that <lb/>
I may endeavor to instill into his mind the <lb/>
principles of thy true religion and virtue. <lb/>
Lord, give me grace to do it sincerely and <reg orig="pru-|dently">prudently</reg>; <lb/>
and bless my attempts with good <reg orig="suc-|cess">success</reg>." <lb/>
The answer to this prayer was <reg orig="Metho-|dism">Methodism</reg>.</p>
<p>On the night of the fire, when the agonized <lb/>
rector finally realized that wife and children <lb/>
were all safe, he gathered them about him in the <lb/>
garden. He was told that all his property was <lb/>
lost. "What care I," he said. "I have my <lb/>
children and dear wife. These are riches <lb/>
<pb n="47" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0074"/>
enough. Come, neighbors, let us give thanks to <lb/>
God for his blessings."</p>
<p>Possibly the hardest blow to the rector was <lb/>
the loss of his library. His were scholarly <lb/>
tastes, and his library for that day was by no <lb/>
means poor. With what pains and sacrifice it <lb/>
had been gathered, he alone knew. Only two <lb/>
bits of charred paper escaped the flames. One <lb/>
was a copy of the only hymn written by Samuel <lb/>
Wesley now found in the Methodist hymnal, <lb/>
"Behold the Saviour of Mankind," and the <lb/>
other a fragment of his beloved Polyglot Bible <lb/>
with only a sentence legible: "Sell all thou <lb/>
hast. Take up thy cross, and follow me."</p>
<p>From this fire, the family fortunes never <reg orig="re-|covered">recovered</reg>. <lb/>
The rebuilding of the house plunged <lb/>
Dr. Wesley deeper into debt. And the new <reg orig="rec-|tory">rectory</reg> <lb/>
was never decently furnished. The rector, <lb/>
generously impractical as ever, that he "might <lb/>
do what became him, and leave the living <reg orig="bet-|ter">better</reg> <lb/>
than he found it" undertook to plant <reg orig="mul-|berry">mulberry</reg> <lb/>
trees, cherry trees, and pear trees in the <lb/>
garden, and walnut trees "in the adjoining <lb/>
croft." Within doors, Susannah once more <lb/>
gathered her children together. She rigidly <lb/>
enforced the reforms made necessary by their <lb/>
separation during the rebuilding of the house, <lb/>
restored domestic discipline, and vigorously <reg orig="re-|sumed">resumed</reg> <lb/>
the painstaking processes of education.</p>
<p>The aggressiveness of the rector's enemies <lb/>
seemed to have spent itself with the last fire. <lb/>
A revulsion of feeling set in, and for the <reg orig="re-|mainder">remainder</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="48" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0075"/>
of his life at Epworth he took comfort <lb/>
in the friendship and loyalty of his parishioners. <lb/>
Susannah's routine was unchanged. Although <lb/>
Samuel had gone away to the university long <lb/>
before the last fire at Epworth&mdash;all events in <lb/>
the Wesley history date from that memorable <lb/>
fire&mdash;Kezia, the nineteenth and youngest, was <lb/>
born thirteen months after. With children <reg orig="al-|ways">always</reg> <lb/>
in the nursery and in the schoolroom, <lb/>
Susannah's hands were always full. However <lb/>
it was the spiritual welfare of her children&mdash; <lb/>
present and absent&mdash;that concerned her most.</p>
<p>"I have a great and just desire that all your <lb/>
sisters and brothers should be saved as well as <lb/>
you," she once wrote to Samuel, "but I must <lb/>
own I think my concern for you is much the <lb/>
greatest. What, you, my son, you, who was once <lb/>
the son of my extremest sorrow, in your birth <lb/>
and in your infancy, who is now the son of my <lb/>
tenderest love, my friend, in whom is my <reg orig="in-|expressible">inexpressible</reg> <lb/>
delight, my future hope of <reg orig="happi-|ness">happiness</reg> <lb/>
in this world, for whom I weep and pray <lb/>
in my retirements from the world, when no <lb/>
mortal knows the agonies of my soul on your <lb/>
account, no eye sees my tears, which are only <lb/>
beheld by that Father of Spirits of whom I so <lb/>
importunately beg grace for you that I hope I <lb/>
may at least be heard&mdash;is it possible that you <lb/>
should be damned? O that it were impossible! <lb/>
Indeed I think I could almost wish myself <reg orig="ac-|cursed">accursed</reg>, <lb/>
so I were sure of your salvation. But <lb/>
still I hope, still I would fain persuade myself <lb/>
that a child for whom so many prayers have <lb/>
<pb n="49" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0076"/>
been offered to Heaven will not at last <reg orig="mis-|carry">miscarry</reg>." <lb/>
To the severe religious thought of her <lb/>
day, salvation was the aim and end of existence. <lb/>
It was a matter for agonized striving. This <lb/>
very striving, however, made men, real men. <lb/>
Considering the Wesleys she made great, what <lb/>
must have been the strength of her striving!</p>
<p>How this essential salvation was to be <reg orig="ob-|tained">obtained</reg>, <lb/>
was a matter that she insisted upon <lb/>
settling for herself. During the winter of 1712, <lb/>
when the rector was absent in London upon one <lb/>
of his regular "convocation" visitations, she <lb/>
was dissatisfied with the teachings of his curate. <lb/>
Accordingly early one Sunday evening she <lb/>
gathered her children and her servants in her <lb/>
ample kitchen, read the best sermon she could <lb/>
find in print, read prayers, and gave <reg orig="gen-|eral">general</reg> <lb/>
religious instruction. Another night, the <lb/>
father of one of the servants came, and then a <lb/>
neighbor, and then another until some fifty were <lb/>
listening to her. Overflowing the house, they <lb/>
adjourned to the large barn. Soon the <reg orig="out-|raged">outraged</reg> <lb/>
curate, tired of empty benches, was <reg orig="com-|plaining">complaining</reg> <lb/>
to his absent rector that Mrs. Wesley <lb/>
was conducting that thing horrid to <reg orig="ecclesias-|tical">ecclesiastical</reg> <lb/>
ears, a "conventicle." Many scores were <lb/>
week by week gathering with her, he said, to <lb/>
the great scandal of the church and <reg orig="surround-|ing">surrounding</reg> <lb/>
clergy. The equally outraged rector wrote <lb/>
hastily reproving her not only for the damage <lb/>
she would do his reputation, set as he was in <lb/>
high position, but also for the unseemliness of <lb/>
a woman's speaking in public. She replied in <lb/>
<pb n="50" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0077"/>
very vigorous words: "And where is the harm <lb/>
of this? If I and my children went a visiting <lb/>
on Sunday nights, or if we admitted of <reg orig="im-|pertinent">impertinent</reg> <lb/>
visits, as too many do who think <lb/>
themselves good Christians, perhaps it would be <lb/>
thought no scandalous practice, though in truth <lb/>
it would be so. Therefore, why any should <reg orig="re-|flect">reflect</reg> <lb/>
upon you, let your station be what it will, <lb/>
because your wife endeavors to draw people to <lb/>
the church, and to restrain them by reading <lb/>
and other persuasions from their profanation <lb/>
of God's most holy day, I cannot conceive. But <lb/>
if any should be so mad as to do it, I wish you <lb/>
would not regard it. For my part, I value no <lb/>
censure on this account. I have long since <lb/>
shook hands with the world, and I heartily wish <lb/>
I had never given them more reason to speak <lb/>
against me."</p>
<p>She concluded her letter with the wifely <reg orig="re-|joinder">rejoinder</reg> <lb/>
that if as rector he should <hi rend="italic">order</hi> her to <lb/>
discontinue the service, she would obey the <reg orig="con-|stituted">constituted</reg> <lb/>
authority of the church. Nothing less <lb/>
than a command, she said, would suffice; for <lb/>
her reason would never be satisfied with his <reg orig="ar-|guments">arguments</reg>. <lb/>
Needless to say neither her husband <lb/>
nor her rector carried the discussion further.</p>
<p>For twenty-three years longer, their life at <lb/>
Epworth continued unbroken; then the rector <lb/>
died. Thought of his wife and daughters to be <lb/>
left unprovided for embittered the months of <lb/>
his illness. He asked Samuel and John and <lb/>
Charles in turn to take the rectory so that the <lb/>
family would have at least a home. When one <lb/>
<pb n="51" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0078"/>
after the other they declined, he saw no further <lb/>
way in which he himself could shape their future <lb/>
and was at last content to leave their care where <lb/>
it had always been, in the hands of Providence. <lb/>
As his death approached, his simple trust and <lb/>
faith grew even stronger. Again and again he <lb/>
exclaimed: "The inward witness, son, the <reg orig="in-|ward">inward</reg> <lb/>
witness; <hi rend="italic">that</hi> is the proof, the strongest <lb/>
proof of Christianity!" To his youngest son <lb/>
he said: "Be steady! The Christian faith will <lb/>
surely revive in this kingdom. You shall see <lb/>
it, though I shall not." As the flame of the <lb/>
rector's life flickered and then burned out, his <lb/>
son John read the last prayers for the dying. <lb/>
So Samuel Wesley left Epworth rectory, where <lb/>
for thirty-nine years he had suffered and toiled.</p>
<p>Seven years later the son&mdash;even then the <lb/>
wonder of England&mdash;who had committed to <lb/>
Heaven the soul of his dying father was denied <lb/>
the use of his father's church. From the tomb <lb/>
of his father he preached, night after night <lb/>
under the open sky, to the men and women of <lb/>
Epworth, to a congregation which covered all <lb/>
the hillside. As hundreds responded to his <lb/>
preaching&mdash;preaching which brought religion <lb/>
out of the closet and made it vital for all men <lb/>
&mdash;he remembered his mother's "conventicle" <lb/>
when as a lad of eight he had heard her preach <lb/>
to these same neighbors; he remembered also <lb/>
the last words of his father, "The inward <reg orig="wit-|ness">witness</reg>, <lb/>
son, the inward witness!" These two <lb/>
ideas, the simple congregation of worshipers <lb/>
and the witness of the spirit, were the cardinal <lb/>
<pb n="52" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0079"/>
doctrines of John Wesley's new faith; these <lb/>
two cardinal doctrines found their birth in the <lb/>
rectory at Epworth.</p>
<p>In these seven years after her husband's <lb/>
death, Susannah lived in the homes of her <reg orig="chil-|dren">children</reg>. <lb/>
John and Charles envied Samuel his <lb/>
greater ability to do for her; Charles wrote him: <lb/>
"Let the Society give her what they please, <lb/>
she must be still, in some degree, burdensome <lb/>
to you, as she calls it. How do I envy you that <lb/>
glorious burden, and wish I could share it with <lb/>
you! You must put me in some way of getting <lb/>
a little money, that I may do something in this <lb/>
shipwreck of the family, though it be no more <lb/>
than furnishing a plank."</p>
<p>Hardly had she lost her husband when she <lb/>
was called upon to part with her two youngest <lb/>
sons who sailed for America in the full flush <lb/>
of youthful missionary zeal. Feeble as she <lb/>
was when she parted with them, she never <reg orig="ex-|pected">expected</reg> <lb/>
to see them again. Yet she sent them <lb/>
away with her blessing: "Had I twenty sons I <lb/>
should rejoice that they were all so employed, <lb/>
though I should never see them more."</p>
<p>Months later when broken in health and <lb/>
spirits, they returned from their unsuccessful <lb/>
journey, as naturally as when they had been <lb/>
lads, they returned for comfort to their mother.</p>
<p>The next parting was for all time. In 1739 <lb/>
she had returned to London, an aged widow; <lb/>
fifty years before she had left it in the happy <lb/>
fullness of early married life. All her <reg orig="twenty-|five">twenty-five</reg> <lb/>
brothers and sisters were dead; of her own <lb/>
<pb n="53" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0080"/>
children but nine survived. Then Samuel died, <lb/>
Samuel her firstborn and always best beloved, <lb/>
with whom she had expected to spend what life <lb/>
remained to her. He had amply repaid his <lb/>
mother's affection; to the lads John and <lb/>
Charles he had been a second father. Bitter <lb/>
as was her loss, she wrote to Charles with <reg orig="char-|acteristic">characteristic</reg> <lb/>
courage: "Your brother was <reg orig="exceed-|ing">exceeding</reg> <lb/>
dear to me in his life; and perhaps I have <lb/>
erred in loving him too well. I once thought it <lb/>
impossible for me to bear his loss; but none <lb/>
know what they can bear till they are tried. <lb/>
He is now at rest, and would not now return to <lb/>
earth to gain the world. Why then should I <lb/>
mourn?"</p>
<p>Although always in sympathy personally <lb/>
with his brothers, Samuel, long before his death, <lb/>
had been startled by these lads adventuring <reg orig="in-|to">into</reg> <lb/>
a new faith and a new creed. At last he had <lb/>
pled with them in a very agony of concern for <lb/>
their spiritual life. But to their mother, their <lb/>
progress was as natural as the unfolding of a <lb/>
flower. As her years grew shorter, her mind <lb/>
harked back to the earlier faith of her girlhood, <lb/>
of her own father's comfortable faith and <lb/>
genial hope. She remembered her own "<reg orig="con-|venticle">conventicle</reg>" <lb/>
in the kitchen at Epworth and so was <lb/>
not frightened at the thousands who gathered <lb/>
in the fields and lanes to listen to her eloquent <lb/>
sons. When John became the acknowledged <lb/>
head of Oxford Methodists he sent her an <reg orig="ac-|count">account</reg> <lb/>
of their work and the sneering opposition <lb/>
to it. She replied: "I heartily join with your <lb/>
<pb n="54" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0081"/>
small Society in all their pious and charitable <lb/>
actions, which are intended for God's glory. <lb/>
&hellip; May you still, in such good works, go on <lb/>
and prosper! Though absent in body, I am <lb/>
present with you in spirit; and daily <reg orig="recom-|mend">recommend</reg> <lb/>
and commit you all to Divine <reg orig="Provi-|dence">Providence</reg>."</p>
<p>She did not content herself, however, with <lb/>
mere sympathy. Her constructive advice <lb/>
played no small part in shaping the new <reg orig="doc-|trines">doctrines</reg> <lb/>
as one by one they were developed in <lb/>
John's mind. Always practical-minded she <lb/>
aided materially in keeping the new creed <lb/>
"with feet on the earth" while its "head was <lb/>
in the clouds." For instance, when John <reg orig="re-|turned">returned</reg> <lb/>
from an evangelistic tour and found <lb/>
that a layman had been preaching, although in <lb/>
no fashion ordained, it was her gentle <reg orig="remon-|strance">remonstrance</reg> <lb/>
which held his indignation in check and <lb/>
saved to the new church one of its most <reg orig="dis-|tinctive">distinctive</reg> <lb/>
features&mdash;the lay preacher.</p>
<p>"Thomas Maxfield has turned preacher, I <lb/>
find," said John.</p>
<p>"John," said his mother, "take care what <lb/>
you do with respect to that young man; for he <lb/>
is as surely called of God to preach as you are. <lb/>
Examine what have been the fruits of his <lb/>
preaching and hear him yourself."</p>
<p>Concerning her son's own preaching, her <reg orig="in-|fluence">influence</reg> <lb/>
was in the right direction. "Suffer now <lb/>
a word of advice," she wrote him. "However <lb/>
curious you may be in searching into the nature <lb/>
or in distinguishing the properties of the <reg orig="pas-|sions">passions</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="55" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0082"/>
or the virtues of human kind, for your <lb/>
own private satisfaction, be very cautious in <lb/>
giving nice distinctions in public assemblies; for <lb/>
it does not answer the true end of preaching, <lb/>
which is to mend men's lives, and not to fill <lb/>
their heads with unprofitable speculations. <lb/>
And after all is said, every affection of the soul <lb/>
is better known by experience than any <reg orig="descrip-|tion">description</reg> <lb/>
that can be given of it. An honest man <lb/>
will more easily apprehend what is meant by <lb/>
being zealous for God and against sin when he <lb/>
hears what are the proper ties and effects of <lb/>
true zeal, than the most accurate definition of <lb/>
its essence."</p>
<p>This excellent advice, she re&euml;nforced with the <lb/>
statement:</p>
<p>"I have often wondered that men should be <lb/>
so vain as to amuse themselves by searching <lb/>
into the decrees of God, which no human wit can <lb/>
fathom; and do not rather employ their time <lb/>
and their prowess in working out their <reg orig="salva-|tion">salvation</reg> <lb/>
and making their own calling and election <lb/>
sure. Such studies tend more to confound than <lb/>
inform the understanding, and young people <lb/>
had best let them alone."</p>
<p>As she had helped the rector at Epworth she <lb/>
now helped her two sons in London. In literal <lb/>
fact as well as in the maternity that enfolded <lb/>
her sons, she was the mother of Methodism.</p>
<p>The new faith grew. As she saw the <reg orig="dis-|ciples">disciples</reg> <lb/>
of her sons number into the thousands, <lb/>
she quietly watched the sands in her own glass <lb/>
run lower and lower. As she saw all England <lb/>
<pb n="56" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0083"/>
quickened into a new spiritual life, her own <lb/>
religious life softened and deepened. As she <lb/>
saw John and Charles and their followers <lb/>
awaken dead consciences, she now centered in <lb/>
them all the hopes and longings of the long line <lb/>
of pious forebears. In the souls of her young <lb/>
preacher sons she saw caught all the greatness <lb/>
of spirit of the Wesleys and the Annesleys who <lb/>
had gone before.</p>
<p>An old foundry at Moorfields had been fitted <lb/>
up as a church and dwelling for John and his <lb/>
helpers. Here Mrs. Wesley came on the last <lb/>
short stage of her journey. Here she died in <lb/>
July 1742. The same son who had read the <lb/>
prayer for the dying as her husband breathed <lb/>
his last read for her the same comforting words <lb/>
of victory.</p>
<p>Her last request was: "Children as soon as <lb/>
I am released, sing a psalm of praise to God!" <lb/>
As they had honored her in life, so they obeyed <lb/>
her in death. Gathered about her bedside they <lb/>
forced back their grief as the anthem of her <reg orig="re-|lease">release</reg> <lb/>
and of their love swelled to triumphant <lb/>
notes. And well might the anthem be <reg orig="trium-|phant">triumphant</reg>, <lb/>
for Susannah Wesley had so played her <lb/>
mother-part in the drama of Epworth Parish <lb/>
that she gave to the world&mdash;not to Methodists <lb/>
alone&mdash;a new freedom of large faith, a new <lb/>
democracy of vital religion, and a new intimacy <lb/>
with God.</p>

ELIZABETH ANN SETON</hi></head>
<byline><hi rend="small-caps">by r. v. trevel</hi></byline>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Elizabeth ann bayley</hi>, who became <lb/>
Mrs. William Magee Seton, was an <reg orig="Amer-|ican">American</reg> <lb/>
Episcopalian gentlewoman. It was very <lb/>
much owing to the distinction and influence of <lb/>
her family that Mrs. Seton's conversion to the <lb/>
Church of Rome was of high advantage to it <lb/>
during its beginnings in the United States. <lb/>
Her birth date of 1774 fixes her as a <reg orig="contempo-|rary">contemporary</reg> <lb/>
of Mr. Washington Irving and Captain <lb/>
Fenimore Cooper, whom she knew, although she <lb/>
did not live so long as these other New Yorkers. <lb/>
Her pen was as gifted, too, in its way as theirs; <lb/>
but Mrs. Seton wrote little for general <reg orig="pub-|lication">publication</reg>, <lb/>
notwithstanding the thirteen volumes <lb/>
of her correspondence and reminiscences which <lb/>
are treasured in the mother-house of the <reg orig="re-|ligious">religious</reg> <lb/>
community which she founded at <reg orig="Em-|mitsburg">Emmitsburg</reg> <lb/>
in Maryland. Of translations, Mother <lb/>
Seton made one of the life of St. Vincent de <lb/>
Paul, whose life so resembles her own though <lb/>
two centuries and an ocean separate them, and <lb/>
made several others of religious works also <lb/>
French. She was guided in her pathway <reg orig="curi-|ously">curiously</reg> <lb/>
much by French minds, and also by <reg orig="mem-|bers">members</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="58" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0085"/>
of a notable family of Italy, devout people <lb/>
whose friendship was brought her by her <reg orig="hus-|band">husband</reg>. <lb/>
Moreover, in part she was French by <lb/>
birth.</p>
<p>The Huguenot family of the Lecomtes, or <lb/>
Lecontes, came to American shores in the <lb/>
eighteenth century, and, establishing <reg orig="them-|selves">themselves</reg> <lb/>
on Long Island Sound, they applied the <lb/>
name of their Bay of Biscay castle to the spot, <lb/>
calling it New Rochelle. A son of an English <lb/>
family of position in the County of Norfolk, <lb/>
who came likewise to the colony of New York in <lb/>
the same generation, married a Miss Leconte. <lb/>
One of the sons of this marriage was Richard <lb/>
Bayley, who became eminent in New York City <lb/>
as a distinguished physician and a citizen of <lb/>
fine character. Dr. Bayley married Miss <lb/>
Catharine Charlton, daughter of an <reg orig="Episcopal-|ian">Episcopalian</reg> <lb/>
clergyman of Staten Island; and they had <lb/>
three daughters, Mary, Elizabeth &lpar;the subject <lb/>
of this chapter&rpar;, and Catharine. The young <lb/>
mother did not survive the Revolution, the <lb/>
drama of which was then playing on the stage <lb/>
of New York; and only two years later the <reg orig="in-|fant">infant</reg> <lb/>
Catharine died. "I sat alone," Elizabeth <lb/>
records in her <hi rend="italic">Remembrances</hi>, "on the step of <lb/>
the doorway, looking at the clouds, while my <lb/>
little sister Catharine lay in her coffin. They <lb/>
asked me, 'Did I not cry when Kitty was dead?' <lb/>

and piety, was a habit, almost a pastime, <lb/>
with Elizabeth all her life.</p>
<p>Dr. Bayley now married a Miss Barclay, the <lb/>
property of whose family included the present <lb/>
Barclay Street. Little is related of the second <lb/>
Mrs. Bayley except that Elizabeth quickly <reg orig="be-|came">became</reg> <lb/>
attached to her&mdash;and to her half-brothers <lb/>
and sisters as they were born. More notable <lb/>
was the close companionship which formed <reg orig="be-|tween">between</reg> <lb/>
the child and her father. When she first <lb/>
began to learn her letters, and to work her <lb/>
sampler, the schoolmistress was a somnolent <lb/>
old person, and the little girl when she saw her <lb/>
father in the street on his professional visits <lb/>
would slip out and kiss him undiscovered. <lb/>
This is the only irregularity in which Dr. <reg orig="Bay-|ley">Bayley</reg> <lb/>
indulged his daughter; he saw that her <reg orig="na-|ture">nature</reg> <lb/>
was noble, and studied to moderate and <lb/>
perfect her sensitiveness and ardor into a <reg orig="bal-|anced">balanced</reg> <lb/>
character.</p>
<p>The windows of Dr. Bayley's house looked <lb/>
across the Battery, and Bowling Green, which <lb/>
were shaded parks, and out upon the harbor <lb/>
where the family saw with friendly eyes King <lb/>
George's men-of-war. When Washington had <lb/>
been forced to evacuate the city, and Sir Guy <lb/>
Carleton held it with his troops, Dr. Bayley and <lb/>
this commander became intimates; the doctor, a <lb/>
royalist, served as a surgeon in Carleton's army. <lb/>
But in 1783, when Elizabeth was nine years old, <lb/>
there came a week when the British soldiers <lb/>
grew busy and marched day after day down to <lb/>
<pb n="60" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0089"/>
the boats, and melted away from New York. <lb/>
Instead of their red flag a new one streamed <lb/>
from the poles. A majestic tall gentleman, <lb/>
whom Elizabeth saw riding with Governor <reg orig="Clin-|ton">Clinton</reg>, <lb/>
who now ruled the city, asked him, she was <lb/>
told, if New York would make the best capital <lb/>
for the country; but both the Colony, or the <lb/>
State as now it was called, and the city decided <lb/>
against this, and so General Washington took <lb/>
up his first presidency in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>Dr. Bayley, with public spirit, conformed to <lb/>
the new government, and soon served it as the <lb/>
health-officer of the port of New York. He <lb/>
was also made the first professor of anatomy <lb/>
in Columbia College. When in 1788 he went <lb/>
to England, to read further in his profession, <lb/>
Elizabeth went to the Westchester County <lb/>
home of her father's family. Even though only <lb/>
fourteen she had met society, as young women <lb/>
then did early, and was already admired by the <lb/>
other sex, by William Seton among others. <lb/>
Elizabeth was accomplished, too, and bright <lb/>
and charming always, in company or <reg orig="compan-|ionship">companionship</reg>; <lb/>
but she cared least for this side of <reg orig="ex-|istence">existence</reg>, <lb/>
even thus young. By preference, she <lb/>
went alone. She read St. Thomas &agrave; Kempis' <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Imitation of Christ</hi>, read the poets Milton <lb/>
and Thomson, read these books beside her <reg orig="con-|stant">constant</reg> <lb/>
Bible, which had been her favorite book <lb/>
since she was seven. She was once surprised on <lb/>
the high rocks of an icy hilltop in winter, where <lb/>
she was singing hymns with face upturned to <lb/>
the sky. The story seems that of a wild spirit, <lb/>
<pb n="61" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0090"/>
but the maid was anything but wild; she was <lb/>
rather simply pure and purely religious, one <lb/>
who perceived God in all the aspects of nature. <lb/>
In her own words: "I took joy in God that He <lb/>
was my Father. This thought gave me <reg orig="pleas-|ure">pleasure</reg> <lb/>
in everything, coarse, rough, smooth, or <lb/>
easy, and made me always gay,"&mdash;gay, for <lb/>
oftenest in her most precious book she turned <lb/>
to the joyous Psalms. On the beach she would <lb/>
sometimes walk reciting her hymns at night. <lb/>
If Elizabeth had known any Roman Catholics <lb/>
her dawning asceticism might have been <reg orig="ex-|plained">explained</reg>, <lb/>
but there were but a handful of Roman <lb/>
Catholics in the State, and they were regarded <lb/>
with horror probably by herself as by others. <lb/>
Perhaps she took some of her promptings from <lb/>
her reading of history in her father's library. <lb/>
Her Guardian Angel, in whose spiritual <reg orig="exist-|ence">existence</reg> <lb/>
she believed, was her only censor among <lb/>
the books; the doctor, a freethinker, was <reg orig="accus-|tomed">accustomed</reg> <lb/>
to let her pore over whatsoever volumes <lb/>
she would, and Rousseau and Voltaire, whose <lb/>
works she perused, did her no harm.</p>
<p>After Dr. Bayley returned from abroad and <lb/>
the family was united again, Elizabeth, in the <lb/>
brilliancy and beauty of her growing youth, <lb/>
shone in the inner circle of fashionable New <lb/>
York. She was gracefully slight. Miss <reg orig="Sad-|lier">Sadlier</reg> <lb/>
speaks of her brilliant black eyes; and her <lb/>
French biographer, Madame de Barberey, <reg orig="de-|scribes">describes</reg> <lb/>
them as large and brown, full of tender <lb/>
light, and correctly traces a delicate strength in <lb/>
the pure features. Undoubtedly these eyes, so <lb/>
<pb n="62" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0091"/>
brightly soft, were derived with the innocent <lb/>
sparkle of her spirit from her Huguenot <reg orig="grand-|mother">grandmother</reg>. <lb/>
In the beautiful profile of a miniature <lb/>
the tresses are curling and dark, the <reg orig="complex-|ion">complexion</reg> <lb/>
evidently pale; the line of the nose would <lb/>
be straight but for an outward curve ever so <lb/>
slight. The whole features wear both a <reg orig="wom-|an's">woman's</reg> <lb/>
fair charm and the light of a mind.</p>
<p>The gaieties of her season as a belle far from <lb/>
absorbed her. Visions of a higher, more <reg orig="ear-|nest">earnest</reg> <lb/>
life haunted her; she wished that there were <lb/>
monasteries of holy men in America, and <reg orig="con-|vents">convents</reg> <lb/>
of consecrated virgins among whom she <lb/>
might cast her lot and pass her life in the <reg orig="serv-|ice">service</reg> <lb/>
and praise of God. As there were no such <lb/>
institutions on Manhattan Island, Elizabeth <lb/>
persuaded "the friend of her soul," Rebecca <lb/>
Seton, to visit the sick and poor with her. The <lb/>
two young girls grew to be familiar figures on <lb/>
the streets, as they carried their baskets of <lb/>
good things; they were called the protestant <lb/>
sisters of charity.</p>
<p>The Seton mansion on Stone Street was one <lb/>
of the most princely in New York. Equally <lb/>
hospitable was Mr. Seton's "Craigdon," his <lb/>
Bloomingdale country-seat, about six miles up <lb/>
the Hudson, its wooded acres covering the <reg orig="west-|ern">western</reg> <lb/>
slopes of the island, beginning at a point <lb/>
about where Grant's tomb now is. Mr. Seton's <lb/>
interests were in iron manufacturing in New <lb/>
Jersey, and in shipping; his agents in Italy <lb/>
were the Filicchi Brothers, distinguished <reg orig="Ital-|ians">Italians</reg> <lb/>
who knew such Americans as John Adams, <lb/>
<pb n="63" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0092"/>
Jefferson and Charles Carroll. His son <reg orig="Wil-|liam">William</reg> <lb/>
had spent some years abroad, a part of the <lb/>
time in the business house of the Filicchi. In <lb/>
1791 William was in New York, however, for so <lb/>
he dated a letter to his brother in which he says: <lb/>
"It is currently reported and generally <reg orig="be-|lieved">believed</reg> <lb/>
that I am to be married to Miss Bayley." <lb/>
The ardent manner in which this letter goes on <lb/>
to forget its dignified beginning leaves little <lb/>
doubt of the current reports, and history has <lb/>
left none. William Seton and Elizabeth <reg orig="Bay-|ley">Bayley</reg> <lb/>
were married in St. Paul's Church by their <lb/>
Bishop, Dr. Prevoost, on January 25, 1794. <lb/>
Few and brief, however were the years of <reg orig="hap-|piness">happiness</reg> <lb/>
which followed for her, for Elizabeth <lb/>
Seton's life was to be a sorrowful one.</p>
<p>Her father was no more devoted to her than <lb/>
the elder Seton promptly became. Because of <lb/>
her responsive intelligence the old merchant <lb/>
took her into his intimacy more than he did his <lb/>
own daughters, who were motherless and many. <lb/>
With her he discussed the disasters to his ships, <lb/>
for those were troubled days when first the <lb/>
French Revolution and then Bonaparte was <reg orig="dis-|turbing">disturbing</reg> <lb/>
the peace of Europe, and no cargo was <lb/>
safe on the seas. Young Seton was forced to <lb/>
travel much; once he wrote to his bride from <lb/>
Philadelphia: "I showed my friends your <lb/>
miniature, and many agreeable things were <lb/>
said for which I felt greatly flattered, but let <lb/>
them know that the artist, although a <reg orig="French-|man">Frenchman</reg>, <lb/>
had not at all flattered <hi rend="italic">you</hi>." The italics <lb/>
are the lover's. Their first child, Anna, was <lb/>
<pb n="64" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0093"/>
born in May, 1795. On the very next year, <lb/>
however, a shadow fell&mdash;her husband began to <lb/>
fail in health. The embarrassment of the large <lb/>
Seton affairs also increased. These cares were <lb/>
partly countervailed by the successive birth of <lb/>
Elizabeth's William, Richard, Rebecca and <lb/>
Catharine. In 1798, however, the head of the <lb/>
family died, unable longer to sustain the <reg orig="fail-|ure">failure</reg> <lb/>
of his fortune. His death threw the whole <lb/>
disorganized business upon the shoulders of <lb/>
his consumptive son; or rather it should be <lb/>
said, upon William and his beautiful wife, for <lb/>
her clear judgment proved valuable in the <lb/>
tangled business.</p>
<p>Another blow fell upon young Mrs. Seton <lb/>
when she was twenty-six. It is strange to think <lb/>
of yellow fever year after year in New York, <lb/>
but in the early days of the last century <reg orig="sani-|tary">sanitary</reg> <lb/>
engineering was most rudimentary. Dr. <lb/>
Bayley, who as health-officer was established at <lb/>
his quarantine station on Staten Island, fought <lb/>
the disease nobly and ably. In 1801 he <reg orig="con-|tracted">contracted</reg> <lb/>
it. His daughter's distraction was not <lb/>
only from fear of his death but concerning his <lb/>
salvation. As he was dying she won from him <lb/>
some expression of Christian belief; but, not <lb/>
satisfied, she caught up her infant Catharine <lb/>
and offered her life to God for the saving of her <lb/>
father's soul! Possibly in the intensity of her <lb/>
filial and religious feeling Elizabeth meant to <lb/>
promise a mortal sacrifice such as those of the <lb/>
oldest Hebrew days. If so, the frenzy duly <lb/>
passed; but indeed Catharine's life was <reg orig="de-|voted">devoted</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="65" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0094"/>
to God as promised, for she died at ninety <lb/>
as the Mother Superior of the Sisters of <lb/>
Charity of Mount St. Vincent on the Hudson, <lb/>
one of the largest communities descended from <lb/>
the one her mother founded in Maryland.</p>
<p>In 1803 the Setons hoped to improve Mr. <lb/>
Seton's health by a sea voyage, and, taking <lb/>
Anna their eldest child with them, they sailed <lb/>
for Italy on the packet <hi rend="italic">Shepherdess</hi>. The <reg orig="voy-|age">voyage</reg> <lb/>
did the invalid no good; and at the end of <lb/>
it, on account of the yellow fever at New York, <lb/>
they were not permitted to land at Leghorn; <lb/>
for a month the passengers were quarantined, <lb/>
almost imprisoned, in a lazaretto. Mr. Seton's <lb/>
old friend Filippo Filicchi, who came from his <lb/>
home in Umbria to meet the party, found them <lb/>
a sad group behind the pest-house grating. It <lb/>
was largely through the efforts of Signor <lb/>
Filicchi and his brother Antonio that the <reg orig="Amer-|icans">Americans</reg> <lb/>
were finally released and allowed to <reg orig="pro-|ceed">proceed</reg> <lb/>
to Pisa. Their friends were worthy <reg orig="suc-|cessors">successors</reg> <lb/>
of the great Italian merchants of the <lb/>
Middle Ages, and were indeed true Christian <lb/>
gentlemen. But not all the kindness of the <lb/>
Filicchi and the sleepless devotion of his wife <lb/>
could save the sick man. Mrs. Seton again, as <lb/>
at her father's death, endeavored to bring the <lb/>
sufferer to religious thoughts and prayer; <reg orig="al-|though">although</reg> <lb/>
reared in the Episcopal Church, he had <lb/>
never been devout. She had the sad happiness <lb/>
of his responding. As soon as her grief and <lb/>
weakness allowed the use of a pen, she wrote to <lb/>
Rebecca: "I often asked him when he could not <lb/>
<pb n="66" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0095"/>
speak, 'Do you feel, my love, that you are going <lb/>
to your Redeemer?' and he motioned 'yes,' with <lb/>
a look of peace. At a quarter past seven, on <lb/>
Tuesday morning, December 27, his soul was <lb/>
released, and mine from a struggle worse than <lb/>
death." Such was Elizabeth Seton's <reg orig="Christ-|mas">Christmas</reg>. <lb/>
Her husband's body was conveyed to <lb/>
Leghorn, and buried in the protestant cemetery <lb/>
in the presence of all the Americans and <reg orig="Eng-|lish">English</reg> <lb/>
then there.</p>
<p>As soon as Mrs. Seton could rest and recover <lb/>
strength after her loss, Signora Amabilia <lb/>
Filicchi begged her to accompany her to <reg orig="Flor-|ence">Florence</reg> <lb/>
on a visit to relatives who lived in the <lb/>
palace of the Medici. In Florence Elizabeth's <lb/>
friend took her to the chapel of La Sanctissima <lb/>
Annunziata. "A heavy curtain," she wrote to <lb/>
Rebecca, "hung at the entrance; we raised it <lb/>
and my eyes were struck with the sight of <reg orig="hun-|dreds">hundreds</reg> <lb/>
kneeling; but the gloom of the chapel, <lb/>
lighted only by wax tapers on the altar and a <lb/>
small window at the top, darkened with green <lb/>
silk, made every object at first appear very <reg orig="in-|distinct">indistinct</reg>, <lb/>
while that kind of soft and distant <lb/>
music which lifts the minds to a foretaste of <lb/>
heavenly pleasures, called up in an instant <lb/>
every dear and tender idea of my soul, and <reg orig="for-|getting">forgetting</reg> <lb/>
Signora Amabilia's company, and all <lb/>
the surrounding scenes, I sank on my knees in <lb/>
the first place I found vacant and shed a <reg orig="tor-|rent">torrent</reg> <lb/>
of tears at the recollection of how long I <lb/>
had been a stranger in the house of my God, <lb/>
and the accumulated sorrow that had separated <lb/>
<pb n="67" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0096"/>
me from it." And while the mass was being <lb/>
said Elizabeth Seton repeated all that she could <lb/>
remember of the service of her own church&mdash; <lb/>
which was to be hers little longer. From the <lb/>
time of her entering the Florentine chapel she <lb/>
began to entertain the question whether its <reg orig="re-|ligion">religion</reg> <lb/>
was not the true one and the Anglican <lb/>
faith mistaken. She resisted and dispelled the <lb/>
idea, but it always returned. Being sincere <lb/>
Roman Catholics themselves, the Filicchi <reg orig="en-|couraged">encouraged</reg> <lb/>
her questionings. Moreover, the <lb/>
members of this patrician family impressed <lb/>
her with the beauty of their religion by the <reg orig="per-|petual">perpetual</reg> <lb/>
presence of it in their lives. But one <lb/>
day Antonio provoked the widow to say, with a <lb/>
touch of her old archness: "O my, sir, if there <lb/>
is but one faith, and nobody pleases God <reg orig="with-|out">without</reg> <lb/>
it, where are all the good people that die <lb/>
out of it?"</p>
<p>"I don't know," answered Filicchi; "that <reg orig="de-|pends">depends</reg> <lb/>
on what light of faith they have received. <lb/>
But I know where people go who <hi rend="italic">can</hi> know the <lb/>
right faith by praying and inquiring for it and <lb/>
yet do neither!"</p>
<p>"Much as to say, sir," returned Mrs. Seton, <lb/>
"you want me to pray and inquire, and be of <lb/>
your faith?"</p>
<p>"Yes, pray and inquire," Filicchi repeated <lb/>
earnestly. "That is all I ask of you."</p>
<p>Soon after, at a mass in the beautiful church <lb/>
of Our Lady of Monte Nero her next neighbor <lb/>
was a cynical young English tourist who at the <lb/>
moment of the elevation ventured to whisper to <lb/>
<pb n="68" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0097"/>
her with a sneer, "This is what they call their <lb/>
'Real Presence.'" The American lady sank <lb/>
on her knees in disgust at the stranger's <reg orig="blas-|phemy">blasphemy</reg> <lb/>
and in sympathy with the worshipers. <lb/>
That stanza of Pope's ran in her mind: <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"If I am right, Thy grace impart,</l>
<l rend="indent">Still in the right to stay;</l>
<l>If I am wrong, oh, teach my heart</l>
<l rend="indent">To find the better way."</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>What most appealed to Mrs. Seton in Italian <lb/>
religious life was that one was able to go to <lb/>
mass every day. She so yearned for every <lb/>
possible sharing of the Lord's Supper that <lb/>
when she was at home in New York it was her <lb/>
habit to hurry from one communion table to <lb/>
that in another church each Sunday, because <lb/>
the Episcopal churches did not celebrate the <lb/>
communion through the week.</p>
<p>In February, 1804, the widow, with Annina, <lb/>
as she now called her daughter, turned <reg orig="home-|ward">homeward</reg>. <lb/>
Again they embarked in the <hi rend="italic"><reg orig="Shepherd-|ess">Shepherdess</reg></hi>, <lb/>
but it collided with another vessel, and had <lb/>
to put back for repairs. It may well seem <lb/>
that Providence intended to sanctify Elizabeth <lb/>
Seton through tribulation: now Annina took <lb/>
the dread scarlet fever, and as soon as Annina <lb/>
was up the mother contracted the disease <reg orig="her-|self">herself</reg>. <lb/>
When they were able to travel, however, <lb/>
the chivalrous friendship of Antonio Filicchi <lb/>
decided him to accompany Mrs. Seton to New <lb/>
York. In April they started on their voyage <lb/>
in the <hi rend="italic">Flamingo</hi> and sailed up the Narrows on <lb/>
<pb n="69" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0098"/>
the first of June. The very month after her <lb/>
arrival she lost her nearest and dearest friend, <lb/>
her sister-in-law Rebecca, in whose charge Mrs. <lb/>
Seton's younger children had lived during her <lb/>
stay abroad.</p>
<p>There followed now a year of intellectual <lb/>
anguish. Mrs. Seton wavered between the <lb/>
faith of her fathers and that of Rome. Signor <lb/>
Filicchi remained in America for some time, <lb/>
doing all he could to win this devout spirit to <lb/>
his Church. Elizabeth often and seriously <reg orig="dis-|cussed">discussed</reg> <lb/>
the question of the true religion with her <lb/>
rector, the distinguished Mr. Hobart; but he <lb/>
convinced her of nothing in saying that "the <lb/>
sumptuous and splendid worship of Italy will <lb/>
not, I am sure, withdraw your affections from <lb/>
the simple and affecting worship of Trinity <lb/>
Church." Mrs. Seton was more and more <reg orig="real-|izing">realizing</reg>, <lb/>
on the contrary, that the richer worship <lb/>
was gaining all her religious affections. The <lb/>
members of her family and her connections <lb/>
stormed at her or met her coldly, according to <lb/>
their natures, but Mrs. Seton was undisturbed <lb/>
and sought only the approbation of her God. <lb/>
At last convinced that she was being led by the <lb/>
hand of God, Mrs. Seton was received into the <lb/>
Church of Rome on Ash Wednesday in March, <lb/>
1805, by Father Matthew O'Brien, in St. <lb/>
Peter's Church in Barclay Street. The step <reg orig="de-|prived">deprived</reg> <lb/>
her of almost every former friend. It <lb/>
isolated her, practically without means of <reg orig="sup-|port">support</reg>, <lb/>
in the city of her birth where her family <lb/>
were among the rulers.</p>
<pb n="70" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0099"/>
<p>In passing, one cannot but question whether, <lb/>
if there had been Episcopal sisterhoods in her <lb/>
time, she would not have entered one of their <lb/>
orders and remained in the faith in which she <lb/>
was born. It is very possible that she would; <lb/>
the Episcopal was the faith of her fathers and <lb/>
it would naturally have had the loyalty of <reg orig="in-|heritance">inheritance</reg>. <lb/>
Yet her imagination was so <reg orig="com-|manding&mdash;while">commanding&mdash;while</reg> <lb/>
spontaneous and vivid&mdash;that <lb/>
even had there been an Anglican order for her <lb/>
to enter, she might still have been captivated <lb/>
into some cloister of the most imaginative <reg orig="re-|ligion">religion</reg> <lb/>
that has flowered from the New <reg orig="Testa-|ment">Testament</reg>.</p>
<p>The elder Mr. Seton, it must be understood, <lb/>
had left Elizabeth's husband little but his ruin. <lb/>
It was necessary for Elizabeth to give up the <lb/>
Stone Street mansion, and she moved into a <lb/>
cottage about a mile and a half out of town, <lb/>
evidently somewhere between the Union and <lb/>
Madison Squares of to-day. Signor Filicchi <lb/>
begged her to draw on his agent for pecuniary <lb/>
means; indeed the two Italian gentlemen served <lb/>
Mrs. Seton in this way almost throughout her <lb/>
career. She always accepted their kindness <lb/>
with a similar generous simplicity; there was <lb/>
less of the personal than of religious in the <reg orig="giv-|ing">giving</reg> <lb/>
and receiving of their funds. At this time <lb/>
Elizabeth thought of winning an income by <lb/>
teaching. She joined a well-mannered English <lb/>
Roman Catholic, a Mr. White, who, with his <lb/>
wife, was about to open a school for boys. It <lb/>
is amazing now over a century later to know <lb/>
<pb n="71" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0100"/>
what happened. New York was so prejudiced <lb/>
against the Church of Rome that people would <lb/>
not send their sons to this school conducted by <lb/>
three of that faith, and it had to close. Mrs. <lb/>
Seton endeavored to secure a place as a teacher <lb/>
in the boarding school of the Reverend Mr. <lb/>
Harris, Curate of St. Mark's Episcopal Church <lb/>
in the Bowery, but he did not dare to give the <lb/>
post to the gentle applicant. He did agree, <lb/>
however, to send some of his pupils to board <lb/>
with her. Mrs. Seton rented two adjoining <lb/>
houses in Stuyvesant's Lane, but the parents <lb/>
at once removed their children from the school, <lb/>
lest any contact with a Roman Catholic should <lb/>
poison their Christianity. The persecuted <lb/>
woman had to give up her boarding house. <lb/>
Only the repeal of the law saved her from <reg orig="pros-|ecution">prosecution</reg> <lb/>
for breaking the act against the conduct <lb/>
of schools by members of her faith. The talk <lb/>
excited by Mrs. Seton's conversion was <reg orig="prob-|ably">probably</reg> <lb/>
the cause of a riotous demonstration <lb/>
against St. Peter's Roman Catholic Church. <lb/>
She meekly suffered, but what was to be done?</p>
<p>Elizabeth thought now of teaching in some <lb/>
convent in Canada where her church was well <lb/>
established. At the advice of her friends Bishop <lb/>
Carroll and Father William Louis du Bourg <lb/>
she decided instead to go to Baltimore to teach <lb/>
a girls' school there. Mrs. Seton sold "<reg orig="Craig-|don">Craigdon</reg>" <lb/>
and all its chattels with joy, such was her <lb/>
relief to leave the hostile faces in her own New <lb/>
York. She and her daughters reached <reg orig="Balti-|more">Baltimore</reg> <lb/>
on Corpus Christi, 1808; and her boys <lb/>
<pb n="72" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0101"/>
who, through the generosity of the Filicchi had <lb/>
been at Georgetown College on the Potomac, <reg orig="en-|tered">entered</reg> <lb/>
St. Mary's College of Baltimore, a <reg orig="Sulpi-|tian">Sulpitian</reg> <lb/>
institution of which Dr. du Bourg was the <lb/>
president. Under his direction she opened a <lb/>
school next to the Chapel of St. Mary's <reg orig="Semi-|nary">Seminary</reg>. <lb/>
Thus at last in friendly Baltimore she <lb/>
met peace and happiness; her greatest joy was <lb/>
that she could now practice her religion as fully <lb/>
and freely as she wished. Not only were there <lb/>
noble priests in Baltimore, but also cultivated <lb/>
women of her new faith, such as Madame <lb/>
Fournier, the sister of Father du Bourg. A <lb/>
number of these distinguished leaders of the <lb/>
church were great Frenchmen who had been <lb/>
storm-tossed to our American shores by <lb/>
the Revolution which had shipwrecked their <lb/>
France; such of them as du Bourg and <reg orig="Matig-|non">Matignon</reg>; <lb/>
Flaget and Nagot; David, Dubois, Bruti, <lb/>
and Duhamel; and Bishop Cheverus of Boston <lb/>
believed that she was "destined for the <reg orig="accom-|plishment">accomplishment</reg> <lb/>
of a considerable work in the United <lb/>
States."</p>
<p>In friendly Baltimore, the school flourished; <lb/>
as many girls came as it could accommodate. <lb/>
In 1808 an incident occurred which hinted a <reg orig="pos-|sibility">possibility</reg> <lb/>
that Mrs. Seton had desired for many <lb/>
years. To her who had worn a crucifix from <lb/>
her childhood, and longed for a conventual life <lb/>
ever since, the dream now seemed to be <reg orig="turn-|ing">turning</reg> <lb/>
into a plan.</p>
<p>Father Badad, the spiritual director of the <lb/>
school, on a visit to Philadelphia, met there a <lb/>
<pb n="73" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0102"/>
Mr. O'Conway who told him that he had a <lb/>
daughter, Cecilia, who desired to take the veil, <lb/>
but he regretted that she would have to go to <lb/>
Europe to accomplish her purpose. Father <lb/>
Badad, after a moment's reflection, replied: <lb/>
"I believe that Miss O'Conway will not have <lb/>
to leave the United States. There is a holy <lb/>
widow in Baltimore whose virtue is the wonder <lb/>
of all who know her; she wishes to lead the <reg orig="re-|tired">retired</reg> <lb/>
life of self-sacrifice and good works, and <lb/>
something may come of it if these two ladies <lb/>
should correspond and meet." Cecilia <reg orig="O'Con-|way">O'Conway</reg> <lb/>
did go to Baltimore and was welcomed by <lb/>
Mrs. Seton. Thus in the little Paca Street <lb/>
schoolhouse something in the nature of a <reg orig="com-|munity">community</reg> <lb/>
was formed between these two, with the <lb/>
approval and blessing of Bishop Carroll and <lb/>
the priesthood. The original purpose was to <lb/>
teach poor Roman Catholic children.</p>
<p>News of the movement speedily brought <lb/>
further applicants to share in it, among them <lb/>
Maria Murphy, niece of the Philadelphia <lb/>
philanthropist, Matthew Carey, and several <lb/>
young girls of Baltimore and other places in its <lb/>
region. In spite of the cruelty of New York <lb/>
towards Elizabeth Seton, her church had grown <lb/>
rapidly there; it sent two candidates for <lb/>
membership. Baltimore furnished two more. <lb/>
Then, later still, two of Elizabeth's sisters-<reg orig="in-|law">in-law</reg>, <lb/>
Cecilia and Harriet Seton, who loved and <lb/>
admired her, came to join her. In truth, Cecilia <lb/>
&mdash;"sweet, merry Cis," as Mrs. Seton called her <lb/>
&mdash;had pined for her in sickness in New York, <lb/>
<pb n="74" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0103"/>
and had half run away to Baltimore followed <lb/>
by Harriet. Father du Bourg was appointed <lb/>
as the ecclesiastical superior of the new <reg orig="com-|munity">community</reg>, <lb/>
and Mrs. Seton was elected and <reg orig="con-|secrated">consecrated</reg> <lb/>
as its superioress. The name adopted <lb/>
was that of the Sisterhood of St. Joseph. One <lb/>
evening soon after, conversing with her sisters, <lb/>
Mother Seton suddenly burst into tears, and, <lb/>
falling on her knees, remained long in that <reg orig="posi-|tion">position</reg> <lb/>
confessing the most humiliating actions of <lb/>
her life; until, with hands extended to Heaven, <lb/>
she exclaimed in prayer: "My gracious God! <lb/>
Thou knowest my unfitness for this task. I who <lb/>
by my sins have so often crucified Thee, I blush <lb/>
with shame and confusion. How can I teach <lb/>
others, who know so little myself, and am so <lb/>
miserable and imperfect!"</p>
<p>This new American order patterned as closely <lb/>
as possible after the organization of the French <lb/>
Sisters or Daughters of Charity founded by St. <lb/>
Vincent de Paul. The Sisters of St. Joseph <lb/>
adopted a habit very much like the dress which <lb/>
Mrs. Seton had worn ever since her widowhood, <lb/>
one that she had copied from the costume of <lb/>
some nuns in Italy. The cap was of white <reg orig="mus-|lin&mdash;later">muslin&mdash;later</reg> <lb/>
changed to black&mdash;with a crimped <lb/>
border, and the gown of flowing black with a <lb/>
short cape.</p>
<p>With all the pupils in residence besides these <lb/>
Sisters, the Paca Street premises were <reg orig="out-|grown">outgrown</reg>. <lb/>
One morning, after receiving the holy <lb/>
communion, Mother Seton observed a student <lb/>
from the neighboring seminary kneeling in <lb/>
<pb n="75" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0104"/>
front of her; he was a young Virginian of some <lb/>
fortune, and the superioress exclaimed to <reg orig="her-|self">herself</reg>: <lb/>
"Oh, if he would buy some land for our <lb/>
sisters, and build a little house for us!" She <lb/>
later found Mr. Cooper was entertaining the <lb/>
same thought at the time; he did donate a <reg orig="thou-|sand">thousand</reg> <lb/>
dollars for the purchase of land for an <reg orig="in-|stitution">institution</reg> <lb/>
for the Sisters. The place chosen was <lb/>
selected largely at the instance of Father Jean <lb/>
Dubois, later the Bishop of New York, who now <lb/>
became associated with Mother Seton in the <reg orig="di-|rection">direction</reg> <lb/>
of her community. A friend of de <lb/>
Lafayette's, he was a spirited Parisian priest <lb/>
who had refused to compromise with the French <lb/>
National Assembly. Bishop Carroll had <reg orig="as-|signed">assigned</reg> <lb/>
him to the spiritual charge of <reg orig="north-|western">northwestern</reg> <lb/>
Maryland, a frontier country in which <lb/>
Frederick, Emmitsburg, Hagerstown, and <lb/>
Westminster were the principal settlements. <lb/>
He built the first Roman Catholic church at <lb/>
Frederick. Knowing that district, Father <reg orig="Du-|bois">Dubois</reg> <lb/>
showed the bishop a grand and solitary <lb/>
valley near Emmitsburg in the Blue Ridge; two <lb/>
miles up one mountain, perched the College of <lb/>
Mount St. Mary, a branch of the Baltimore St. <lb/>
Mary's Seminary over which Father du Bourg <lb/>
presided. Here a site was purchased for the <lb/>
building of the first American sisterhood.</p>
<p>An Indian legend, which sprang up in this <lb/>
part of Father Dubois' wilderness, makes the <lb/>
choice of a location seem most happy. Miss <lb/>
Sadlier relates the story of this fair, wooded <lb/>
plain, where the magnolia and thorn-apple <lb/>
<pb n="76" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0105"/>
breathed and bloomed in an inspiring mountain <lb/>
world:</p>
<p>"Nearly two centuries before, when <reg orig="Mary-|land">Maryland</reg> <lb/>
was first colonized, one of the Jesuit <reg orig="mis-|sionaries">missionaries</reg>, <lb/>
in quest of Indian tribes to whom he <lb/>
might make known the glad tidings of <reg orig="Salva-|tion">Salvation</reg>, <lb/>
toiled up the hills and traversed the <reg orig="track-|less">trackless</reg> <lb/>
forests, until he reached this valley, and <lb/>
preached the Word of God to the red men whom <lb/>
he found there. Like all the Maryland Indians, <lb/>
whose passions were never roused by the <reg orig="in-|justices">injustices</reg> <lb/>
that their race met with in other <reg orig="Eng-|lish">English</reg> <lb/>
colonies, they received the black-robe with <lb/>
respect, and accepted the true faith. Dark <lb/>
Puritan days afterwards came to Maryland, and <lb/>
the tribe lost their beloved Father; but one, at <lb/>
least, among them, never forgot his teachings, <lb/>
and faithfully practiced his religion, as far as <lb/>
he could do so. This was a chief of rank and <lb/>
power amongst his people. He had a special <lb/>
devotion to Our Blessed Lady, and used to say <lb/>
his beads many times a day, often wishing as <lb/>
he did so, in his simple, child-like faith, that <lb/>
he might have the happiness of beholding her. <lb/>
The years went by, and the chief grew old and <lb/>
feeble, but ever told his beads and wished his <lb/>
wish. At length, one summer day, as he tilled <lb/>
the field, murmuring the while his 'Hail Marys,' <lb/>
a beautiful gracious lady, clad in flowing robes <lb/>
stood before him, and told him that she was the <lb/>
Blessed Virgin whom he had so longed to see. <lb/>
'Know,' she continued, 'that in this field where <lb/>
you have for so many years prayed to me, I <lb/>
<pb n="77" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0106"/>
shall one day gather many virgins, who will <lb/>
sound continually the praises of God.' The <lb/>
beautiful vision then faded, leaving the old <lb/>
chief filled with happiness." Elizabeth Seton <lb/>
led her mild Sisters here as if in fulfillment of <lb/>
this vision.</p>
<p>The first party left Baltimore with Mother <lb/>
Seton on June 21, 1808, to prepare for the <reg orig="com-|ing">coming</reg> <lb/>
of the rest. The distance was fifty miles. <lb/>
The gentle group traveled in primitive fashion, <lb/>
with a huge canvas-covered wagon such as in <lb/>
the middle of the century was to cross the <lb/>
prairies to California for earthly gold; <reg orig="gen-|erally">generally</reg> <lb/>
all walked, excepting Cecilia Seton, who <lb/>
was frail and ill, though happy, and rested as <lb/>
well as she might in the crude jolting vehicle. <lb/>
The mother in her diary says playfully: "The <lb/>
ducks and pigs came out to meet us, and the <lb/>
geese stretched their necks in mute demand to <lb/>
know if we were one of their sort, to which <lb/>
we gave assent."</p>
<p>After several days' pilgrimage they reached <lb/>
their domain, then hardly more than a bare <lb/>
clearing a half-mile from the sparse <reg orig="Emmits-|burg">Emmitsburg</reg> <lb/>
village. The coming struggle, lightly born <lb/>
though it was, would have seemed lighter if <lb/>
they could have seen arise before them the <lb/>
present group of stately buildings which they <lb/>
were founding that day. But as it was, they <lb/>
were met by little more than hardship. As the <lb/>
Flemming farmhouse, which was being refitted <lb/>
for their occupation, was not ready, Father <reg orig="Du-|bois">Dubois</reg> <lb/>
gave up his house to them. It was a tiny <lb/>
<pb n="78" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0107"/>
structure of only two rooms, but Mother Seton <lb/>
and her young companions were so glad to have <lb/>
arrived and to find themselves in their mountain <lb/>
temple that they made light of all their severe <lb/>
discomforts.</p>
<p>The status of Harriet Seton was different <lb/>
from that of the rest. Although of course <lb/>
sympathetic with her friends, she had not yet <lb/>
become a Roman Catholic. She was there <lb/>
really as a companion to watch over her sick <lb/>
sister, Cecilia. But how many of those who <lb/>
seem to be last shall be first. In the first <lb/>
months of Emmitsburg was enacted the closing <lb/>
scene of this young girl's tragedy. She was <lb/>
engaged to Mrs. Seton's half-brother, Barclay <lb/>
Bayley, to whom she was warmly attached, and <lb/>
it was her intention as soon as Cecilia was <reg orig="per-|fectly">perfectly</reg> <lb/>
well again to return to New York to <lb/>
marry him. In the healthful mountain air <reg orig="Ce-|cilia">Cecilia</reg> <lb/>
grew stronger, happy in her religion and <lb/>
in Mrs. Seton. But Harriet lingered on, held <lb/>
there by the happiness of the sisters in all <lb/>
their labor and their rites. She waited <reg orig="wist-|fully">wistfully</reg> <lb/>
about Father Dubois' church when they <lb/>
had entered it. All in the church wore <reg orig="some-|thing">something</reg> <lb/>
that she did not, but she wore something <lb/>
on the ribbon around her neck that they did not. <lb/>
She would kiss it. Could she doubt its worth? <lb/>
The comparison between her miniature of her <lb/>
lover and the crucifix was inevitable. She felt <lb/>
herself yielding to the sweet, potent attraction <lb/>
of the ancient church; yet her heart with girlish <lb/>
truth long fought for the absent one, her lover. <lb/>
<pb n="79" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0108"/>
It was in vain, for after a sharp struggle she <lb/>
found herself the lover only of Christ, and she <lb/>
adopted the Roman form of His service. In <lb/>
the warmth of her fervor she so spent and <reg orig="ex-|posed">exposed</reg> <lb/>
herself in nursing the sick that she <reg orig="con-|tracted">contracted</reg> <lb/>
a mortal disease herself. So lately <lb/>
the flower of fashion in New York, Harriet <lb/>
Seton laid her young form down in the first <lb/>
grave that was dug for the Sisterhood of St. <lb/>
Joseph. This was in the December of 1809. <lb/>
Cecilia followed to lie beside her only four <lb/>
months after.</p>
<p>One day, soon after their coming, when <lb/>
Mother Seton and her companions had been <lb/>
walking about their property and inspecting the <lb/>
progress on their new house, the superioress <lb/>
said: "Nothing is lacking save the place of <lb/>
our final repose on earth. Let us choose where <lb/>
that shall be." Harriet Seton had sat down <lb/>
to rest beneath an oak. "See my place!" she <lb/>
exclaimed. And she threw an apple against <lb/>
the tree and caught it on the rebound. It was <lb/>
in that spot that they buried her and her sister <lb/>
so soon after; and adjoining their graves the <lb/>
general cemetery of the congregation was laid <lb/>
out.</p>
<p>These deaths show the early want and <lb/>
struggle of the Sisterhood. Even in the rebuilt <lb/>
Flemming cottage the household conditions <lb/>
were little improved, if at all. This building, <lb/>
named the "Stone House," consisted only of <lb/>
an undivided interior with a garret above; and <lb/>
even this space was further limited by a little <lb/>
<pb n="80" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0109"/>
oratory which Father du Bourg, who came from <lb/>
Baltimore, set apart at one end, with its altar <lb/>
at which he held the first mass for the infant <lb/>
community. Mrs. Seton appointed Sister Kitty <lb/>
Mullen as housekeeper; Sister Rose as Mother's <lb/>
assistant; Sister Cecilia as secretary and school <lb/>
sister; Sister Sally as procuratrix, washer and <lb/>
baker. The Sisters all cooked in turn, and <lb/>
helped in the washing. They primitively <lb/>
washed in the stream, some distance away in <lb/>
the valley, for the dwelling had no "modern <lb/>
conveniences." Sister Rose White has <reg orig="de-|scribed">described</reg> <lb/>
the routine:</p>
<p>"The Sisters rose at five o'clock. Prayer, <lb/>
meditation, and recital of a third part of the <lb/>
Rosary occupied them till a quarter to seven. <lb/>
At seven they assembled in the little oratory <lb/>
recess to hear Mass celebrated by Father <reg orig="Du-|bois">Dubois</reg>, <lb/>
and after Mass they recited the second <lb/>
part of the Rosary. They breakfasted at nine. <lb/>
Then, after an act of adoration to the Sacred <lb/>
Heart, they separated to employ themselves in <lb/>
the discharge of their several duties, such as <lb/>
nursing and other neighborhood visiting as well <lb/>
as work indoors. At a quarter to twelve they <lb/>
gave some moments to examination of <reg orig="con-|science">conscience</reg>, <lb/>
to adoration, and to reading of the <lb/>
New Testament. During dinner at noon one <lb/>
of the Sisters read aloud some pages of Holy <lb/>
Scripture, to which the others listened in <reg orig="re-|flection">reflection</reg>. <lb/>
After dinner there was recreation <reg orig="un-|til">until</reg> <lb/>
two o'clock. Reading of the <hi rend="italic">Imitation</hi> and <lb/>
work filled the time from then until five, when <lb/>
<pb n="81" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0110"/>
they made a visit to the Blessed Sacrament and <lb/>
recited another third of the Rosary. At seven <lb/>
they had supper, followed by recreation until <lb/>
half-past eight. The day terminated with short <lb/>
spiritual reading and prayer. It was a life <lb/>
tending to the fulfillment of the Apostle's <lb/>
counsel: 'Pray without ceasing; all that you <lb/>
do, do for the love of Jesus Christ.'" Mother <lb/>
Seton was so constant "in her fervour and <lb/>
mortification" that her juniors imitated her <lb/>
with love and reverence.</p>
<p>The Sisters went to mass on Sundays up to <lb/>
the church on the mountain near the college. <lb/>
They waded the brook which crossed their <lb/>
forest path, until Father Dubois observed the <lb/>
wetness of their feet and had a horse sent down <lb/>
to them. The Sisters in their turn assumed the <lb/>
care of the church altar, washing its linens, and <lb/>
one or another of them took the part of organist <lb/>
through the chanting of the psalms and <reg orig="can-|ticles">canticles</reg>. <lb/>
It was a weekly pastime on fine <reg orig="Sun-|days">Sundays</reg> <lb/>
to climb the mountain after mass to a <reg orig="half-|sheltered">half-sheltered</reg> <lb/>
dell of rocks which they called their <lb/>
"grotto." From this eminence they had a <lb/>
magnificent sweep of mountain view. The <lb/>
valley, nesting the village and their little <reg orig="hab-|itation">habitation</reg>, <lb/>
stretched away in beauty beneath their <lb/>
eyes. To such women as these the sublime <lb/>
scenery woke no feelings so much as adoration <lb/>
of its Creator and gratitude to Him. Up here <lb/>
Elizabeth Seton often recited the canticle of <lb/>
the three children in the fiery furnace, that <lb/>
prayer which calls upon all things to bless and <lb/>
<pb n="82" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0111"/>
glorify God, their parent. They spread their <lb/>
luncheon here, the mother and the rest <reg orig="con-|versing">conversing</reg> <lb/>
gaily, for they were ever the <reg orig="lightest-|hearted">lightest-hearted</reg> <lb/>
of ascetics. Afterwards they climbed <lb/>
or read or talked, until the notes of the distant <lb/>
church bell rose softly to their ears and called <lb/>
them down to the vespers which ended the one <lb/>
recreation of their week.</p>
<p>The principal objects of Mother Seton's order <lb/>
were always two: the teaching of children and <lb/>
the saving of souls. No doubt the two purposes <lb/>
were considered as different forms of the same <lb/>
thing. The congregation was to subsist by <lb/>
teaching, but at the start it was so poor that <lb/>
it had almost no means. Their few pupils <lb/>
brought their numbers up to sixteen; with the <lb/>
help of the meager payments for tuition and <lb/>
board, they were barely able to house and feed <lb/>
themselves. The Sisters gave the pupils far <lb/>
better food than they had themselves; the <reg orig="com-|munity">community</reg> <lb/>
members could afford neither butter, <lb/>
milk, nor coffee; for long seasons they had <reg orig="noth-|ing">nothing</reg> <lb/>
better than bread made of the coarsest <lb/>
grain and a pitiful tea brewed from molasses <lb/>
and carrot-roots. Mother Seton's watch was <lb/>
the only timepiece. They had no looking-glass <lb/>
and no glass in their windows, only a few slats <lb/>
nailed across the latter, through which the snow <lb/>
came freely in. It is less wonder that Harriet <lb/>
and Cecilia Seton succumbed under such <reg orig="cir-|cumstances">circumstances</reg> <lb/>
than that their Sisters survived.</p>
<p>When Mr. Carroll, who had now become <reg orig="Arch-|bishop">Archbishop</reg> <lb/>
Carroll, had visited the establishment, <lb/>
<pb n="83" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0112"/>
he wrote back to Mother Seton: "I cannot <lb/>
think with calmness of your situation for the <lb/>
winter, for I learn from Father du Bourg that <lb/>
your new house cannot receive you until the <lb/>
beginning of the year, and certainly that is no <lb/>
time for a removal. I have confidence that in <lb/>
spite of my fears you will at least preserve your <lb/>
lives under your present diminutive shelter, <reg orig="in-|convenient">inconvenient</reg> <lb/>
and open to all winds as it is." It <lb/>
is evident that the Archdiocese was poor itself, <lb/>
or Archbishop Carroll must have sent some <reg orig="re-|lief">relief</reg> <lb/>
as well as his sympathy to the Emmitsburg <lb/>
Sisters. Mr. Cooper, who had purchased the <lb/>
land for the Sisterhood, was now a student at <lb/>
the college on the mountain, and he often came <lb/>
down to serve with Father Dubois at mass in <lb/>
the Sisters' tiny chapel.</p>
<p>It is amazing how much the Sisters <reg orig="accom-|plished">accomplished</reg> <lb/>
in their crowded little abode, and <reg orig="al-|most">almost</reg> <lb/>
without income&mdash;teaching poor children, <lb/>
visiting the sick and attending their own, <reg orig="spin-|ning">spinning</reg>, <lb/>
weaving, knitting, and making clothes for <lb/>
the poor. Their own clothes were in such <reg orig="con-|dition">condition</reg> <lb/>
that Bishop Cheverus of Boston, <reg orig="observ-|ing">observing</reg> <lb/>
one particularly tattered Sister, inquired if <lb/>
she were doing a penance. Mother Seton only <lb/>
smiled. More prosperous days followed. By <lb/>
1810 the Stone House was filled to overflowing, <lb/>
and in February, as soon as it was possible, <lb/>
the community moved into its larger building. <lb/>
Now for the first time St. Joseph's Sisterhood <lb/>
thrived. Numerous were the candidates for <reg orig="ad-|mission">admission</reg> <lb/>
to the community and the school. <reg orig="Sis-|ter">Sister</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="84" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0113"/>
Elizabeth Boyle, one who was admitted at <lb/>
this time, came, like the superioress, of a <reg orig="dis-|tinguished">distinguished</reg> <lb/>
Episcopalian family. Thirty-six <lb/>
years later she became the first mother of the <lb/>
New York community.</p>
<p>From the first it had been manifest that the <lb/>
rule of St. Vincent de Paul, which Mother Seton <lb/>
was so anxious to follow, must be modified in <lb/>
certain respects. That rule looks to the <reg orig="educa-|tion">education</reg> <lb/>
of the poor and their assistance in other <lb/>
ways, and in France, where the Daughters of <lb/>
Charity follow it, they are relieved of self-<reg orig="sup-|port">support</reg> <lb/>
by their endowments. At the same time, <lb/>
in Europe there are numerous schools for the <lb/>
daughters of the well-to-do, but such <reg orig="establish-|ments">establishments</reg> <lb/>
were few in the United States at the <reg orig="be-|ginning">beginning</reg> <lb/>
of the nineteenth century. Therefore, <lb/>
instead of confining their efforts to the education <lb/>
of poor children, the St. Joseph's Sisters <lb/>
changed their plan so as to allow themselves <lb/>
to take girls to school whose parents could pay <lb/>
for their tuition and so in part bear the <reg orig="ex-|penses">expenses</reg> <lb/>
of the community. Thus in 1812 the St. <lb/>
Vincent rule, duly modified, was adopted for a <lb/>
probationary year. In the next year the <reg orig="Sister-|hood">Sisterhood</reg> <lb/>
finally ratified the rules and each Sister <lb/>
took her first unconditional vows&mdash;vows which <lb/>
bind the votaress for a twelvemonth, when she <lb/>
might renew them or not. In 1813, eighteen <lb/>
Sisters first pronounced the determinate vows <lb/>
and thus formally became the first American <lb/>
Sisters of Charity. At last, Mother Seton's <lb/>
order was firmly and formally established. <lb/>
<pb n="85" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0114"/>
Also in 1813 the novitiate of the community was <lb/>
formed, with Sister Catharine Mullen as the <lb/>
mistress of novices. From the Emmitsburg <lb/>
Community as thus organized have sprung <lb/>
either directly or indirectly almost all the <reg orig="Ro-|man">Roman</reg> <lb/>
Catholic sisterhoods now in the United <lb/>
States. The mother community at <reg orig="Emmits-|burg">Emmitsburg</reg> <lb/>
has remained the largest house. Its <lb/>
greatest daughter community is that of Mount <lb/>
Saint Vincent on the Hudson, which in turn has <lb/>
mothered houses in New Jersey and Canada <lb/>
and elsewhere. At the time of Elizabeth <lb/>
Seton's death at forty-seven her spirit had <reg orig="al-|ready">already</reg> <lb/>
borne and reared twenty-one communities <lb/>
in the East; and now they have spread into <lb/>
nearly every State. They have taken the form <lb/>
of orphan asylums, hospitals, free schools, and <lb/>
boarding schools. In the governance of these <lb/>
schools she allowed no <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italic">espionnage</hi></foreign>, no watching <lb/>
of the pupils to "catch" them in misdoings. <lb/>
The only punishment permitted by Mother <lb/>
Seton was, when necessary, to require the <reg orig="re-|factory">refactory</reg> <lb/>
pupil to sit on a bench before a crucifix; <lb/>
there always sooner or later the child would <lb/>
melt, and come and confess her fault, when she <lb/>
would be kissed upon the forehead and sent <lb/>
away happy. It is no wonder that a ruler of <lb/>
so smiling an authority was so beloved.</p>
<p>In 1819 a question arose as to Mother Seton's <lb/>
re&euml;lection. The rules forbade more than two <lb/>
successive terms, and Mother Seton herself <reg orig="ob-|jected">objected</reg> <lb/>
to her own re&euml;lection; she had already <lb/>
served twice and an illness had weakened her. <lb/>
<pb n="86" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0115"/>
The community, however, would not entertain <lb/>
the thought of having any other superior. <lb/>
Archbishop Carroll referred the problem to a <lb/>
council of Sulpitian priests. As the dignitaries <lb/>
sustained the Sisters in setting aside the rule <lb/>
in this matter, Mother Seton meekly obeyed, <lb/>
with the remark, however, that it was an <reg orig="elec-|tion">election</reg> <lb/>
of the dead. In two years' time she did <lb/>
lapse away in consumption, in 1821. At <reg orig="Em-|mitsburg">Emmitsburg</reg> <lb/>
in a bare room one reads in silence <lb/>
this inscription:</p>
<p>HERE, NEAR THIS DOOR, BY THE <reg orig="FIRE-|PLACE">FIREPLACE</reg>, <lb/>
ON A POOR, LOWLY COUCH, DIED OUR <lb/>
CHERISHED AND SAINTED MOTHER SETON, <lb/>
ON THE 4TH OF JANUARY, 1821. SHE DIED <lb/>
IN POVERTY, BUT RICH IN FAITH, AND GOOD <lb/>
WORKS.</p>
<p>Her body reposes in a Gothic tomb of white <lb/>
marble in the center of the cemetery. Cardinal <lb/>
Gibbons in 1880 urged that steps be taken <reg orig="to-|wards">towards</reg> <lb/>
her canonization, and the question of <lb/>
naming her a saint is still pending in the Vatican <lb/>
in Rome. And well may she be canonized, for <lb/>
her life was rich not alone in religious <reg orig="exalta-|tion">exaltation</reg> <lb/>
but in that saintship of service which has <lb/>
pronounced its benediction upon suffering <lb/>
everywhere. Founder of the Sisters of Charity <lb/>
she was, but her work did not stop there. The <lb/>
devotion of her Sisters has found its <reg orig="counter-|part">counter-part</reg> <lb/>
in other faiths and creeds. Wherever <lb/>
there is sorrow there is woman's compassion <lb/>
<pb n="87" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0116"/>
buoyed by woman's faith. And the language <lb/>
of this compassion is the same whether it issues <lb/>
from lips framed in the close black bonnet of <lb/>
the Deaconess or the snowy wimple of the Sister <lb/>
of Charity.</p>

<p>After her death, this tribute was paid to Mrs. <lb/>

he cannot but feel that the tribute was earned.</p>
<p>She was born on the third of the "First <lb/>

where her ancestors had lived since its <lb/>

was a man of refinement and of unusually <reg orig="stu-|dious">studious</reg> <lb/>
habits. Her mother, Anna Folger Coffin, <lb/>
is described as a woman of great energy, keen <lb/>
wit and unfailing good sense. They were <reg orig="mem-|bers">members</reg> <lb/>
of the Society of Friends as their fathers <lb/>
and grandfathers had been before them, and <reg orig="Lu-|cretia">Lucretia</reg> <lb/>
was carefully trained in the beliefs and <lb/>
daily observances of this society. She wore <lb/>
the sober costume of the Friends, she attended <lb/>
the meetings, and was taught to seek the Divine <lb/>
Guidance in all the problems of her childish <lb/>

world. She believed that she was wayward and <lb/>
used to pray earnestly over her hasty temper, <lb/>
but in later life she wrote of herself: "I <reg orig="al-|ways">always</reg> <lb/>
loved the good and in childhood tried to <lb/>
do right."</p>
<p>Very little is told about that childhood. Here <lb/>
and there, a word throws the light for a <reg orig="mo-|ment">moment</reg> <lb/>
on the little girl. She was "<reg orig="high-spir-|ited">high-spirited</reg>," <lb/>
"ingenuous," "quick-tempered," "<reg orig="im-|patient">impatient</reg> <lb/>
of stupidity," "active," "<reg orig="warm-|hearted">warmhearted</reg>," <lb/>
"a spit-fire," "a tease," yet she was <lb/>
the little mother of a family of five whenever <lb/>
Mrs. Coffin made her necessary trips to the <lb/>
mainland; she was the trusted messenger, sent <lb/>
on all the important errands; and she had <lb/>
learned to sit without drowsiness or <reg orig="restless-|ness">restlessness</reg> <lb/>
during the Friends' meetings. Much may <lb/>
be inferred from these few words. They give <lb/>
the record of a battle for self-discipline, fought <lb/>
and won by a little girl under twelve years of <lb/>
age. They do not show, however, that she had <lb/>
any sense of the artistic. Her attempts at <reg orig="sing-|ing">singing</reg> <lb/>
frequently called from her mother the <reg orig="re-|mark">remark</reg>: <lb/>
"Oh, Lucretia, if thee was as far out of <lb/>
town as thee is out of tune, thee wouldn't get <lb/>
home to-night;" and once, in later years, when a <lb/>
friend called her attention to a beautiful view <lb/>
she said: "Yes, it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> beautiful now that thou <lb/>
points it out, but I should not have noticed it."</p>
<p>While Lucretia was a girl, Mrs. Coffin earned <lb/>
a scanty living, during the long absences of her <lb/>
husband on his cruises, by keeping a little shop <lb/>
for the sale of East Indian goods. As the <reg orig="lead-|ing">leading</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="90" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0121"/>
industries of Nantucket were whale-fishing <lb/>
and East Indian trading, which kept the men <lb/>
away from home much of the time, the women <lb/>
had much opportunity to prove their efficiency <lb/>
in business as well as domestic affairs. Many <lb/>
a Nantucket woman carried on her husband's <lb/>
business during his voyages, besides doing the <lb/>
milking, churning, carding, spinning, weaving, <lb/>
scouring, cooking and mending demanded by <lb/>
her own department of the family partnership. <lb/>
It was small wonder, then, that Lucretia never <lb/>
for a moment looked upon women as the weaker <lb/>
sex. Many years later she said with vigor, at a <lb/>
woman's rights convention: "The cause is <lb/>
dear to my heart. &hellip; I grew up so <reg orig="thor-|oughly">thoroughly</reg> <lb/>
imbued with woman's rights that it was <lb/>
the most important question of my life from a <lb/>
very early day."</p>
<p>This simple, wholesome life formed <reg orig="Lucre-|tia's">Lucretia's</reg> <lb/>
habits. Although she did not live on the <lb/>
island after her twelfth year, she always <reg orig="cher-|ished">cherished</reg> <lb/>
its traditions and "Nantucket way" was <lb/>
the way of her household to the very end. One <lb/>
of the most winning Nantucket customs was that <lb/>
of drawing the chairs in the front parlor into <lb/>
a sociable circle around the fire, so that when <lb/>
the guests came in from tea, they found them <lb/>
ready for the evening's conversation. This <lb/>
had been little Lucretia's task, and long after <lb/>
her girlhood, she sometimes slipped away from <lb/>
the tea-table and, feeble as she was, pushed the <lb/>
chairs into the old hospitable circle. Her <lb/>
grandchildren all remember her saying when <lb/>
<pb n="91" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0122"/>
they were together in the parlor: "Move up&mdash; <lb/>
come forward. Do come more into a circle."</p>
<p>It was after a most unfortunate experience <lb/>
that Captain Coffin gave up his sea-faring life <lb/>
and moved his family to Boston. At first the <lb/>
children attended a private school, but <reg orig="after-|wards">afterwards</reg> <lb/>
the father sent them to the public schools <lb/>
of the district "to mingle with all classes <reg orig="with-|out">without</reg> <lb/>
distinction." The child profited by this <lb/>
contact for she wrote later that it gave her a <lb/>
"feeling of sympathy for the patient and <reg orig="strug-|gling">struggling</reg> <lb/>
poor."</p>
<p>When she was thirteen years old, Lucretia <lb/>
was sent, with a younger sister, to the Friends' <lb/>
Boarding school at Nine Partners, New York. <lb/>
Here they remained for two years without going <lb/>
home, for the journey was too expensive to be <lb/>
undertaken. The school experience was, on the <lb/>
whole, a happy one, though the fair-minded <reg orig="Lu-|cretia">Lucretia</reg> <lb/>
sometimes rebelled at what seemed to <lb/>
her the unreasonable severity of the discipline. <lb/>
It was especially hard for her to see others <reg orig="pun-|ished">punished</reg> <lb/>
and once when one of the boys&mdash;a favorite <lb/>
of hers&mdash;was confined in a dark closet, on bread <lb/>
and water, she and her sister contrived to get <lb/>
into the boys' side of the house in order to tuck <lb/>
under the door bread liberally buttered.</p>
<p>One of the favorite amusements of the <reg orig="board-|ing-school">boarding-school</reg> <lb/>
girls was to play meeting. At one of <lb/>
these meetings, they considered a case of <reg orig="viola-|tion">violation</reg> <lb/>
of the "Discipline" and Lucretia and <reg orig="an-|other">another</reg> <lb/>
girl were appointed to visit the offender <lb/>
and to report to the society. This report <lb/>
<pb n="92" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0123"/>
they drawled as follows: "Friends, we have <lb/>
visited Tabitha Field&mdash;and&mdash;we labored with <lb/>
her&mdash;and we think&mdash;we mellowed her&mdash;some."</p>
<p>James Mott, who afterwards became <reg orig="Lucre-|tia's">Lucretia's</reg> <lb/>
husband, was a teacher, at this time, in the <lb/>
boys' department of the school. His sister <lb/>
Sarah was Lucretia's favorite friend and the <lb/>
three often met at his home.</p>
<p>When Lucretia was only fifteen, she was <lb/>
made an assistant teacher in the school, and, <lb/>
at the end of a year, was promoted to the <reg orig="posi-|tion">position</reg> <lb/>
of a regular teacher. As teachers, James <lb/>
and Lucretia were frequently thrown together <lb/>
and soon fell deeply in love. They were the <lb/>
exact complement of each other. "He was tall <lb/>
with sandy hair, kind, blue eyes and a shy, grave <lb/>
manner; she was short in stature, dark-haired, <lb/>
impulsive and vivacious in manner and quick in <lb/>
her movements. He enjoyed nothing so much <lb/>
as silence; she nothing more than talking; he <lb/>
was likely to become depressed and <reg orig="discour-|aged">discouraged</reg>; <lb/>
she &hellip; was a sunbeam of happiness. <lb/>
His was the gentler and more yielding <reg orig="disposi-|tion">disposition</reg>; <lb/>
hers the indomitable energy and <reg orig="resolu-|tion">resolution</reg>, <lb/>
which in a less disciplined character might <lb/>
have been willfulness." Even at this age&mdash;17 <lb/>
&mdash;Lucretia's nature contained the elements of <lb/>
spiritual fervor which later developed so <reg orig="beau-|tifully">beautifully</reg> <lb/>
and blossomed into a life devoted to the <lb/>
service of mankind.</p>
<p>The engagement was approved by both <reg orig="fam-|ilies">families</reg>. <lb/>
James accepted a place in Thomas <reg orig="Cof-|fin's">Coffin's</reg> <lb/>
new business. After a few months, he was <lb/>
<pb n="93" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0124"/>
able to declare their intention of marriage <reg orig="be-|fore">before</reg> <lb/>
the monthly meeting, as is the custom of <lb/>
the Friends, and on the tenth of Fourth month, <lb/>
1811, in the Pine Street Meeting House, their <lb/>
marriage was solemnized, according to the order <lb/>
of Friends "with a gravity and weight <reg orig="becom-|ing">becoming</reg> <lb/>
the occasion." James was almost <reg orig="twenty-|three">twenty-three</reg> <lb/>
and Lucretia a little past eighteen. The <lb/>
wish of James' mother that "each succeeding <lb/>
day" might bring "an increase of pure, <reg orig="tran-|quil">tranquil</reg> <lb/>
contentment" was perfectly fulfilled <lb/>
through fifty-seven years of married life. <lb/>
Their friend Robert Collier said of it, many <lb/>
years later: "It was the most perfect wedded <lb/>
life to be found on earth. They were both of a <lb/>
most beautiful presence &hellip; both free to take <lb/>
their own way as such fine souls always are and <lb/>
yet their lives were so perfectly one that neither <lb/>
of them led or followed the other, so far as one <lb/>
could observe, by the breadth of a line."</p>
<p>The first years of their married life were <lb/>
years of financial strain, during which it was <lb/>
necessary to exercise the most rigid economy. <lb/>
When Captain Coffin's business became <reg orig="insuffi-|cient">insufficient</reg> <lb/>
to support two families, James began to <lb/>
look about for a place for himself. Since a <lb/>
little daughter had come to them, there were <lb/>
now three mouths to feed. After two or three <lb/>
unsuccessful attempts to establish himself, he <lb/>
finally, in 1817, entered the employ of John <lb/>
Large, of Philadelphia, at a salary of seven <lb/>
hundred and fifty dollars, with the promise of <lb/>
one thousand dollars before the year was out. <lb/>
<pb n="94" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0125"/>
Lucretia opened a small school, which was <reg orig="suc-|cessful">successful</reg>.</p>
<p>Just at this time an event occurred which was <lb/>
one of the moving influences in Lucretia's life. <lb/>
It was the loss of their second child, a boy of <lb/>
rare promise. In her grief, Lucretia turned to <lb/>
her religion for comfort and was finally moved <lb/>
to express herself in Friends' meeting. Long <lb/>
years afterwards, when asked how she became <lb/>
a preacher in the Society, she said that "grief <lb/>
at the dear boy's death" turned her mind that <lb/>
way and "after a small beginning, meeting with <lb/>
sympathy and encouragement the rest was <reg orig="grad-|ual">gradual</reg> <lb/>
and easy."</p>
<p>When Mrs. Mott entered the ministry, the <lb/>
Society of Friends was, to outward <reg orig="appear-|ances">appearances</reg>, <lb/>
a united body, but it was known among <lb/>
the leaders that there was trouble brewing, the <lb/>
trouble which later resulted in the "<reg orig="Separa-|tion">Separation</reg>." <lb/>
Lucretia, who was always more <reg orig="inter-|ested">interested</reg> <lb/>
in principles than dogmas, took no part in <lb/>
the controversy at first, but her well-known <reg orig="sym-|pathy">sympathy</reg> <lb/>
with Elias Hicks, who later headed the <lb/>
unorthodox party, made her an object of <reg orig="sus-|picion">suspicion</reg> <lb/>
among the orthodox Friends. One day <lb/>
two women elders called on her. They sat a <lb/>
few moments in silence and then said that they <lb/>
had sometimes been unable to agree wholly to <lb/>
the views she advanced and that they had been <lb/>
particularly tried with an expression used by <lb/>
her in meeting on the previous First day. They <lb/>
could not remember the sentence but it ended <lb/>
with "notions of Christ." Mrs. Mott repeated <lb/>
<pb n="95" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0126"/>
the entire sentence: "Men are to be judged by <lb/>
their likeness to Christ rather than by their <lb/>
notions of Christ." Was that it? It was. <lb/>
Then she quietly informed them that it was a <lb/>
quotation from their honored William Penn! <lb/>
The Friends sat in silence a few moments and <lb/>
then rose and left the house. What else could <lb/>
they do?</p>
<p>It is unnecessary to go into the details of this <lb/>
religious controversy. It is enough to know, in <lb/>
this connection, that the liberal party which was <lb/>
afterwards called the "Hicksite," claimed the <lb/>
right of private judgment and individual <reg orig="opin-|ion">opinion</reg> <lb/>
in opposition to a dogmatic settling of all <lb/>
religious questions, and that James and <reg orig="Lucre-|tia">Lucretia</reg> <lb/>
Mott sympathized with this party. In 1827, <lb/>
during the week of the yearly meeting, a large <lb/>
number of Friends gathered to discuss the <reg orig="ques-|tion">question</reg>. <lb/>
The result was that the two parties <lb/>
agreed to separate. The Hicksites "went out" <lb/>
and began to hold meetings of their own. <lb/>
James Mott "went out" with them. For some <lb/>
time Lucretia was undecided what to do. She <lb/>
had dear friends in both divisions, and the <reg orig="sit-|uation">situation</reg> <lb/>
was much as a liberal minded Friend <lb/>
summed it up: "For the short distance you <lb/>
propose to move, it seems scarcely worth while <lb/>
to get up." After about a month, however, she <lb/>
took the step, and never afterwards regretted <lb/>
it.</p>
<p>This division in the Society of Friends <reg orig="re-|flected">reflected</reg> <lb/>
the general spirit of questioning among <lb/>
the churches. Channing's heresy was becoming <lb/>
<pb n="96" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0127"/>
orthodoxy in the face of the bolder utterances <lb/>
of Theodore Parker. Everywhere there was a <lb/>
breaking away from dogma.</p>
<p>With church theologies, the Motts were <reg orig="al-|ways">always</reg> <lb/>
out of sympathy. "The more my <reg orig="atten-|tion">attention</reg> <lb/>
is directed to a studied theology and <reg orig="sys-|tematized">systematized</reg> <lb/>
Divinity, the more deeply do I deplore <lb/>
its effect on the mind and character," Mrs. Mott <lb/>
wrote.</p>
<p>And again: "By what right does Orthodoxy <lb/>
give the invidious name of Infidel &hellip; to those <lb/>
who dissent from its cherished opinions? &hellip; I <lb/>
am not troubled with difficulties about the Bible. <lb/>
I love the truths of the Bible. I love the Bible <lb/>
because it contains so many truths; but I was <lb/>
never educated to love the errors of the Bible." <lb/>
Mrs. Mott searched always for the spirit of the <lb/>
teachings of the Bible and never was confined to <lb/>
its letter. "The bold figurative language of <lb/>
that book &lsqb;the Bible&rsqb; &hellip; should be taken in <lb/>
its most spiritual sense," she said.</p>
<p>When asked once how she reconciled herself <lb/>
to the statements in the old testament in regard <lb/>
to the Lord's commanding his children to go <lb/>
to war, she answered that she did not believe <lb/>
that God ever authorized or sanctioned war in <lb/>
any age or any nation. "I can more easily <reg orig="be-|lieve">believe</reg> <lb/>
that man is fallible than that God is <lb/>
changeable." Again she said: "The error of <lb/>
the assumption of human depravity and a <reg orig="vi-|carious">vicarious</reg> <lb/>
offering is so fatal to human progress <lb/>
that I should be unfaithful to my conviction did <lb/>
I not attempt to controvert this creed and to <lb/>
<pb n="97" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0128"/>
uphold truth as of all acceptation, rather than <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">authority</hi> for truth." At a memorable <reg orig="meet-|ing">meeting</reg> <lb/>
she made the statement that all the leading <lb/>
reforms of the age had sprung, not from <reg orig="dog-|mas">dogmas</reg> <lb/>
but "from the individual soul of man."</p>
<p>The religion of Lucretia Mott went hand in <lb/>
hand with progress. She had no use for the <lb/>
narrow sectarianism that set itself against each <lb/>
forward step taken by the world's thinkers. <lb/>
She believed that the human mind is capable <lb/>
of being perfected and that religion must <reg orig="ac-|complish">accomplish</reg> <lb/>
this emancipation.</p>
<p>Between 1822 and 1830 four more children <lb/>
had been born to Mr. and Mrs. Mott&mdash;the <reg orig="sec-|ond">second</reg> <lb/>
daughter, Martha, came in 1818. Yet in <lb/>
spite of the fact that there was now a family <lb/>
of eight for which to provide and although Mrs. <lb/>
Mott, twelve years before, had given up her <lb/>
school, with its contribution to the family purse, <lb/>
Mr. Mott, in 1830, made the tremendous <reg orig="finan-|cial">financial</reg> <lb/>
sacrifice of retiring from the cotton <reg orig="busi-|ness">business</reg> <lb/>
because it depended on slave labor.</p>
<p>The question of slavery, which was the <reg orig="burn-|ing">burning</reg> <lb/>
one of the hour, had borne itself in upon <lb/>
the consciousness and the conscience of <reg orig="Lucre-|tia">Lucretia</reg> <lb/>
Mott. In her protests against it, she <reg orig="ante-|dated">antedated</reg> <lb/>
even Garrison, and from the time of the <lb/>
separation, she pled "in season and out of <reg orig="sea-|son">season</reg> <lb/>
for immediate emancipation." When in <lb/>
1833, the American Anti-Slavery Society held <lb/>
its third decennial meeting in Philadelphia, to <lb/>
demand "immediate, not gradual <reg orig="emancipa-|tion">emancipation</reg>," <lb/>
she was there as a spectator and <reg orig="re-|sponded">responded</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="98" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0129"/>
to the invitation to speak. The service <lb/>
she rendered the convention was most <reg orig="impor-|tant">important</reg>. <lb/>
When the delegates learned that two <reg orig="in-|fluential">influential</reg> <lb/>
men who had been invited to preside at <lb/>
the meetings had declined for prudential <reg orig="rea-|sons">reasons</reg>, <lb/>
the convention wavered. At that critical <lb/>
moment, Mrs. Mott rose, and with a vigor that <lb/>
carried conviction, reminded her hearers that <lb/>
right principles are stronger than great names.</p>
<p>"If our principles are right, why should we <lb/>
be cowards?" she said.</p>
<p>She took her seat amid cries of "Go on," and <lb/>
not another word was spoken in favor of delay.</p>
<p>Immediately after this convention, the <reg orig="Phila-|delphia">Philadelphia</reg> <lb/>
Female Anti-Slavery Society was <lb/>
formed. Lucretia Mott became one of its <reg orig="mem-|bers">members</reg>, <lb/>
and later its president. Her activity <lb/>
brought down upon her the persecution of the <lb/>
Society of Friends which was taking no <reg orig="posi-|tion">position</reg> <lb/>
in regard to the slavery question and was <lb/>
averse to having one of its members so <reg orig="prom-|inent">prominent</reg> <lb/>
an Abolitionist. The Friends tried again <lb/>
and again to find grounds for dismissing Mrs. <lb/>
Mott from their membership but she gave them <lb/>
no adequate reason. This persecution, which <lb/>
followed her for many years, was a source of <lb/>
great grief to Mrs. Mott, whose friendly nature <lb/>
reached out naturally for approbation. That <lb/>
she followed the course which seemed right to <lb/>
her in spite of the consequences is a proof of <lb/>
her splendid moral courage.</p>
<p>The stand which the Motts took upon <reg orig="Aboli-|tion">Abolition</reg> <lb/>
brought them into many stirring scenes. <lb/>
<pb n="99" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0130"/>
In 1838 Lucretia Mott was one of the women <lb/>
who calmly prosecuted the business of the <reg orig="Anti-|Slavery">Anti-Slavery</reg> <lb/>
Convention of American Women, in <lb/>
Pennsylvania Hall, unmoved by the hoots and <lb/>
yells of the mob which surrounded the <reg orig="build-|ing">building</reg> <lb/>
and hurled stones through the windows. <lb/>
And that night, after the burning of the hall, <lb/>
she and her husband, with a few friends, sat <lb/>
quietly in their parlor awaiting a threatened <lb/>
attack by the same rioters, whose savage cries <lb/>
they could hear, coming closer and closer. The <lb/>
attack was averted, but Lucretia Mott showed <lb/>
that for the sake of her principles she was <lb/>
ready fearlessly to meet even violence.</p>
<p>When speaking of the outrage of the burning <lb/>
of Pennsylvania Hall, Dr. Channing said: <lb/>
"In that crowd was Lucretia Mott, that <reg orig="beauti-|ful">beautiful</reg> <lb/>
example of womanhood. Who that has <lb/>
heard the tones of her voice, and looked on the <lb/>
mild radiance of her benign and intelligent <lb/>
countenance can endure the thought that <lb/>
such a woman was driven by a mob from <lb/>
the spot to which she had gone, as she <reg orig="reli-|giously">religiously</reg> <lb/>
believed, on a mission of Christian <reg orig="sym-|pathy">sympathy</reg>?"</p>
<p>On another occasion, when the annual <reg orig="meet-|ing">meeting</reg> <lb/>
of the Anti-Slavery Society of New York <lb/>
was broken up by a mob, some of the speakers <lb/>
in leaving the hall were roughly handled by the <lb/>
rowdies. When Mrs. Mott noticed this <reg orig="disor-|der">disorder</reg>, <lb/>
she asked the gentleman who was escorting <lb/>
her, to go to the help of some of the women who <lb/>
were timid.</p>
<pb n="100" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0131"/>
<p>"But who will take care of you?" he said.</p>
<p>"This man," she answered, quietly laying her <lb/>
hand on the arm of one of the roughest of the <lb/>
mob, "he will see me safe through."</p>
<p>The ruffian responded to this gentle appeal <lb/>
to his manhood and helped her to a place of <lb/>
safety.</p>
<p>In 1839 the British and Foreign Anti-<reg orig="Slav-|ery">Slavery</reg> <lb/>
Society of London called a general <reg orig="confer-|ence">conference</reg>, <lb/>
to commence June 12, 1840, to confer as to <lb/>
the best means of hastening the extinction of <lb/>
the slave trade. Since the Massachusetts and <lb/>
Pennsylvania Anti-Slavery Societies had by <lb/>
this time admitted women to equal membership <lb/>
with men&mdash;although after a quarrel which <reg orig="di-|vided">divided</reg> <lb/>
the societies&mdash;they responded by sending <lb/>
both male and female delegates to the <reg orig="conven-|tion">convention</reg>. <lb/>
Among these delegates were James and <lb/>
Lucretia Mott, and a woman whose name has <lb/>
become famous in the woman's rights cause, <lb/>
Elizabeth Cady Stanton.<ref target="n1" n="1">*</ref>

</p>
<p>The trip would have been an impossibility to <lb/>
the Motts, owing to financial difficulties, if a <lb/>
friend had not sent them a generous gift of <lb/>
money. This gift they accepted in the spirit in <lb/>
which it was sent, since the cause of Abolition <lb/>
was so dear to their hearts that they were eager <lb/>
to forward it. This evidence of friendship was <lb/>
very sweet to Lucretia Mott, for friends were <lb/>
growing fewer and fewer as she became more <lb/>
and more devoted to the anti-slavery cause. <lb/>
Her health was much broken at this time, and <lb/>
<pb n="101" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0132"/>
her husband welcomed the sea voyage, hoping <lb/>
that it might put new vigor into her frail body.</p>
<p>Mrs. Mott carried to London with her a "<reg orig="min-|ute">minute</reg>" <lb/>
from the Monthly Meeting to which she <lb/>
belonged, which stated that she was an <reg orig="ap-|proved">approved</reg> <lb/>
minister, in good standing with the <reg orig="So-|ciety">Society</reg> <lb/>
of Friends, but the orthodox Friends, who <lb/>
had so persistently carried on their persecution <lb/>
of her in America, took pains to write over to <lb/>
England to warn their "brethren" of the <reg orig="here-|tic">heretic</reg> <lb/>
who was shortly to come to them. <reg orig="Conse-|quently">Consequently</reg> <lb/>
abroad she was the object of much petty <lb/>
persecution of the kind that at home had so <lb/>
annoyed her. One young Quaker, who had <lb/>
pointedly left her out of his invitations on a <lb/>
number of occasions, said to her: "Thou must <lb/>
excuse me, Lucretia, for not inviting thee with <lb/>
the rest, but I fear thy influence on my <reg orig="chil-|dren">children</reg>."</p>
<p>But a greater disappointment than this <reg orig="re-|ception">reception</reg> <lb/>
at the hands of the Friends awaited <lb/>
Mrs. Mott in London. The news came to the <lb/>
Motts that no women were to be admitted as <lb/>
delegates to the convention. Garrison <reg orig="him-|self">himself</reg> <lb/>
felt so outraged at this decision that he <reg orig="re-|fused">refused</reg> <lb/>
to take his seat in the convention. He <lb/>
could not forget that Lucretia Mott was the <lb/>
first woman to give him the right hand of <reg orig="fel-|lowship">fellowship</reg> <lb/>
when he came out of prison.</p>
<p>The effort to seat women was led on the first <lb/>
day of the meeting by Wendell Phillips, whose <lb/>
wife was delegated by the Massachusetts <reg orig="So-|ciety">Society</reg>. <lb/>
An excited discussion followed, which <lb/>
<pb n="102" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0133"/>
continued several hours. Then the question <lb/>
was decided in the negative by a rather large <lb/>
majority because the admission of women was <lb/>
"contrary to precedent," and would make the <lb/>
convention "ridiculous." William Ashurst <lb/>
pointed out to them the inconsistency of calling <lb/>
a <hi rend="italic">world's</hi> convention to abolish slavery and at <lb/>
its opening hour depriving half the world of <lb/>
their liberty.</p>
<p>This act of unfairness and discourtesy Mrs. <lb/>
Mott mentions briefly in her diary. In one <lb/>
place she says: "The Friends present were <lb/>
nearly all opposed to women's admission. We <lb/>
were told that the secret of it was that our <reg orig="com-|ing">coming</reg> <lb/>
had been announced in London Yearly <lb/>
Meeting and that they were put on their guard <lb/>
against us as not of their faith." William <lb/>
Howlitt attributed their exclusion wholly to the <lb/>
fact that they were looked upon by the Friends <lb/>
as heretics. He writes to Mrs. Mott: "What <lb/>
a miserable spectacle is this! The 'World's <lb/>
Convention' converting itself into the fag-end of <lb/>
the Yearly Meeting of the Society of Friends. <lb/>
&hellip; The convention has not merely insulted <lb/>
you, but those who sent you. It has testified <lb/>
that the men of America are at least far ahead <lb/>
of us in their opinion of the discretion and <reg orig="use-|fulness">usefulness</reg> <lb/>
of women."</p>
<p>Mrs. Mott's keen sense of humor never failed <lb/>
her, even in the most discouraging conditions. <lb/>
She jots down in her diary: "The World's <lb/>
Convention &hellip; assembled with such guests as <lb/>
they chose to invite. We were kindly admitted <lb/>
<pb n="103" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0134"/>
behind the bar." And again: "Nathaniel <lb/>
Calvin then for the first time sallied forth to <lb/>
our bar saying: 'Now if the spirit moves you <lb/>
to speak on this subject&mdash;you will be <hi rend="italic">allowed</hi> <lb/>
to say what you wish.' Out of the abundance of <lb/>
a full heart and an indignant spirit here might <lb/>
words have been uttered!"</p>
<p>On the last day of the convention the women <lb/>
were honored by seats downstairs so that they <lb/>
could hold conference with those who chose <lb/>
to go to them. A protest against their <reg orig="ex-|clusion">exclusion</reg> <lb/>
was offered. Mrs. Mott says of it: <lb/>
"Calvin boldly and impudently moved that it <lb/>
be laid on the table. William Scabs made <reg orig="ex-|cellent">excellent</reg> <lb/>
closing remarks that although on some <lb/>
subjects they had had conflicting sentiments <reg orig="di-|viding">dividing</reg> <lb/>
them as distinct as the billows, yet he <lb/>
believed there was unity enough in our common <lb/>
cause to make us again 'as the sea,' and so the <lb/>
Convention closed!"</p>
<p>In an account of the World's Convention, <lb/>
Richard D. Webb of Dublin says: "The <reg orig="mid-|dle">middle</reg> <lb/>
of the front seat of the ladies' own portion <lb/>
of the hall was the usual seat of <hi rend="italic">one</hi> who was <lb/>
certainly one of the most remarkable women of <lb/>
the whole assembly.&hellip;Nobody doubted that <lb/>
Lucretia Mott was the lioness of the <reg orig="Conven-|tion">Convention</reg>."</p>
<p>And again in speaking of the exclusion of the <lb/>
women delegates, he says: "We shall not <reg orig="dis-|cuss">discuss</reg> <lb/>
the question here &hellip; but we shall take <lb/>
the liberty to express our wish that half the <lb/>
temper, fullness of mind, warmth of heart, <reg orig="di-|rectness">directness</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="104" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0135"/>
of utterance, facility of elucidation and <lb/>
vivacity of manner which distinguished <reg orig="Lucre-|tia">Lucretia</reg> <lb/>
Mott had been the gift of nine-tenths of the <lb/>
gentlemen who raised their voices &hellip; for our <lb/>
edification."</p>
<p>Expressions of indignant sympathy from <lb/>
Harriet Martineau, Daniel O'Connor, and a few <lb/>
other friends, helped Mrs. Mott through this <lb/>
period of heart-sickness. Chief among these <lb/>
friends was Elizabeth Cady Stanton, whom they <lb/>
met for the first time in London.<ref target="n2" n="2">*</ref>
<note id="n2" place="foot" n="2"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>See <hi rend="italic">Heroines of Modern Progress</hi>, p. 68.</p></note>
 Mrs. <reg orig="Stan-|ton">Stanton</reg> <lb/>
writes: "Mrs. Mott was to me an entirely <lb/>
new revelation of womanhood." "I found in <lb/>
this new friend a woman emancipated from all <lb/>
faith in man-made creeds. &hellip; Nothing was <lb/>
too sacred for her to question as to its <reg orig="rightful-|ness">rightfulness</reg> <lb/>
in principle and practice. 'Truth for <reg orig="au-|thority">authority</reg>, <lb/>
not authority for Truth, was &hellip; the <lb/>
motto of her life.'"</p>
<p>From London, the Motts made a hurried trip <lb/>
through Ireland and Scotland, where Mrs. <lb/>
Mott preached. The persecution by the <reg orig="ortho-|dox">orthodox</reg> <lb/>
Friends followed them even here, but they <lb/>
found friends who extended to them courtesy <lb/>
and kindness.</p>
<p>After their return to America, the Motts <reg orig="con-|tinued">continued</reg> <lb/>
their life of useful activity. They <reg orig="at-|tended">attended</reg> <lb/>
the Anti-Slavery meetings; Lucretia <lb/>
preached as before, and their house was the <lb/>
gathering place for a large family and circle of <lb/>
friends. A few quotations from her letters will <lb/>
show that her preaching and club work did not <lb/>
<pb n="105" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0136"/>
make Mrs. Mott neglect her housewifely duties. <lb/>
She writes:</p>
<p>"With all this traveling and reading, I find <lb/>
time to darn the stockings, and attend <reg orig="some-|what">somewhat</reg> <lb/>
to a family numbering from ten to twenty <lb/>
every day." "I prepared mince for forty pies, <lb/>
doing every part myself, even to meat <reg orig="chop-|ping">chopping</reg>, <lb/>
picked over lots of apples, stewed a <lb/>
quantity, chopped some more and made apple <lb/>
pudding." "Early in the morning before <lb/>
quite light I assorted the ironed clothes and <lb/>
mended stockings." "We had nine or ten <lb/>
friends lodging with us" and "some forty or <lb/>
fifty at meals daily."</p>
<p>This entertaining was done in the simplest <lb/>
manner, for Mrs. Mott was extremely frugal <lb/>
&mdash;through years of necessity, although her <reg orig="hus-|band">husband</reg> <lb/>
was now prospering in business and they <lb/>
were beyond want.</p>
<p>To keep open house became the habit of her <lb/>
lifetime, so much so that she found herself in <lb/>
an amusing situation, once, when she was <reg orig="visit-|ing">visiting</reg> <lb/>
a granddaughter. The house was small <lb/>
and the family large. Mrs. Mott went up to <lb/>
Boston to meeting and was expected home, with <lb/>
her husband, to a family dinner. However, <lb/>
after the meeting a young gentleman and lady <lb/>
from England presented letters of introduction <lb/>
to her and she became greatly interested in <lb/>
them. When the time came for her to take her <lb/>
train, she impulsively asked them to go home <lb/>
with her to dine. They accepted at once, and <lb/>
she also invited William Garrison, his son, and <lb/>
<pb n="106" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0137"/>
her sister Martha. When they had left the <lb/>
cars, Mrs. Mott, who began to realize what <reg orig="con-|sternation">consternation</reg> <lb/>
their arrival might produce, hurried <lb/>
on ahead to break the news to the hostess. <lb/>
With pretended dismay, but with a good deal of <lb/>
amusement, she said to her granddaughter: <lb/>
"What <hi rend="italic">will</hi> thou say to me! I've asked Lord <lb/>
and Lady Amberly and William Lloyd <reg orig="Garri-|son">Garrison</reg> <lb/>
out here to dine, and Aunt Martha and <lb/>
William with them. They are all just coming <lb/>
up the hill."</p>
<p>It was at home, surrounded by a host of <lb/>
loyal admirers, that Mr. and Mrs. Mott found <lb/>
happiness, although the attacks from the <lb/>
Friends grew more and more bitter. Titled <lb/>
foreigners, scholars, politicians, preachers and <lb/>
reformers met at their board, where, after the <lb/>
meal was over and the table cleared, the <reg orig="sweet-|faced">sweet-faced</reg> <lb/>
hostess washed up the silver and glass, <lb/>
while she joined in the conversation of her <lb/>
guests.</p>
<p>But these guests were not always those who <lb/>
were their social equals. Many a ragged, <reg orig="hun-|gry">hungry</reg> <lb/>
outcast crept to their door and went away <lb/>
fed and clothed, and no hunted fugitive from <lb/>
slavery was ever turned away. Their <reg orig="grand-|daughter">granddaughter</reg> <lb/>
describes an instance of this sort. <lb/>
They were all sitting in the parlor one evening <lb/>
when they heard the angry rumble of a mob. <lb/>
Experience had taught them what to expect; a <lb/>
slave was being pursued.</p>
<p>"With the natural impulse for protection he <lb/>
rushed to the well known refuge&mdash;the house of <lb/>
<pb n="107" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0138"/>
James and Lucretia Mott." James Mott, then <lb/>
a white-haired man, opened the door. The <lb/>
slave dashed in, and without stopping, ran <lb/>
through the house and out of the back gate. <lb/>
James Mott stood at the door confronting the <lb/>
angry mob, when someone threw a brick at him. <lb/>
The brick hit the door jamb behind him, and <lb/>
this bore for many a day the mark of the <reg orig="mis-|directed">misdirected</reg> <lb/>
fury.</p>
<p>At the trial of the Passmore Williams case, <lb/>
Mrs. Mott was in attendance to give sympathy <lb/>
and support to the slave Jane Johnson, and <lb/>
when the poor soul was taken from the Court <lb/>
and driven hastily away, Mrs. Mott sat with her <lb/>
in the carriage.</p>
<p>In the year 1848, around the tea-table of a <lb/>
common friend, the first woman's rights <reg orig="con-|vention">convention</reg> <lb/>
was planned, by Lucretia Mott, <reg orig="Eliza-|beth">Elizabeth</reg> <lb/>
Cady Stanton and Mary Ann McClintock.<ref target="n3" n="3">*</ref>
<note id="n3" place="foot" n="3"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>See <hi rend="italic">Heroines of Modern Progress</hi>, p. 72.</p></note>
 <lb/>
Back in London, during the world's convention, <lb/>
as they walked slowly home together at the end <lb/>
of the first day's session, Mrs. Mott and Mrs. <lb/>
Stanton conceived the idea of a woman's rights <lb/>
convention. Eight years of active work in the <lb/>
cause of Abolition had given these women <reg orig="cour-|age">courage</reg> <lb/>
to start this new crusade and had fully <lb/>
convinced them of the crying need for it. The <lb/>
convention was held in Seneca Falls, New York, <lb/>
July 19 and 20. The Declaration of <reg orig="Senti-|ments">Sentiments</reg> <lb/>
drawn up at this convention demanded <lb/>
all that even the most radical friends of the <lb/>
movement have since claimed.</p>
<pb n="108" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0139"/>
<p>Other conventions followed in various parts <lb/>
of New York, Ohio, Massachusetts, Indiana and <lb/>
Pennsylvania, and for twenty years, Mr. and <lb/>
Mrs. Mott gave the movement their generous <lb/>
support.</p>
<p>In one of her discourses, called "Woman," <lb/>
Mrs. Mott defends her position by reference to <lb/>
the Bible: "The laws given on Mount Sinai <lb/>
for the government of man and woman were <lb/>
equal and the precepts of Jesus make no <reg orig="dis-|tinction">distinction</reg>. <lb/>
Those who read the Scriptures and <lb/>
judge for themselves, not resting satisfied with <lb/>
the perverted application of the text, do not <lb/>
find the distinction that theology and <reg orig="ecclesias-|tical">ecclesiastical</reg> <lb/>
authorities have made in the condition of <lb/>
the sexes." And for all her work, whether for <lb/>
the emancipation of woman or for that of the <lb/>
negroes, there is this background of religion.</p>
<p>During the winter of 1856, it became <reg orig="appar-|ent">apparent</reg> <lb/>
to her family that Mrs. Mott was no longer <lb/>
strong enough to bear the strain of <reg orig="house-|keeping">housekeeping</reg> <lb/>
in the city. She was worn out with <lb/>
entertaining so much and with the constant <lb/>
drain on her sympathy and strength made by <lb/>
friends, public duties and private charities. <lb/>
Her granddaughter says: "It seemed as if she <lb/>
could not call an hour of the day her own; all <lb/>
sorts of people came to her with their affairs <lb/>
and no one appeared to realize that she might <lb/>
have affairs of her own."</p>
<p>So "Three-thirty-eight," the city house, was <lb/>
sold, and a little farmhouse eight miles out of <lb/>
Philadelphia on the Old York Road, opposite <lb/>
<pb n="109" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0140"/>
Oak Farm, where some of her family already <lb/>
lived, was bought.</p>
<p>A final gathering of the clan was arranged, <lb/>
a last meeting before the doors which had <reg orig="al-|ways">always</reg> <lb/>
stood open to them should close for good. <lb/>
A series of nonsense verses written to <reg orig="cele-|brate">celebrate</reg> <lb/>
the event was greeted with shouts of <lb/>
laughter, but for most of those who were <reg orig="pres-|ent">present</reg>, <lb/>
it would have been quite as easy to cry as <lb/>
to laugh. The verses began: <lb/>
<q><lg type="stanza">
<l>Who wearied of the world's renown,</l>
<l>And sought a useful life to crown</l>
<l>By selling off his house in town?</l>
<l rend="indent">James Mott.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>Who was it that the sale decreed</l>
<l>And urged him on to do the deed,</l>
<l>And wished to close the terms with speed?</l>
<l rend="indent">Lucretia!</l>
</lg></q>
And ended with: <lb/>
<q><lg type="stanza">
<l>Who constantly will ring the bell,</l>
<l>And ask if they will please to tell</l>
<l>Where Mrs. Mott has gone to dwell?</l>
<l rend="indent">The beggars.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>And who will miss, for months at least,</l>
<l>That place for rest for man and beast</l>
<l>From North and South and West and East?</l>
<l rend="indent">Everybody.</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>In the spring of 1857 Mr. and Mrs. Mott <lb/>
moved to the new house, where they spent the <lb/>
remainder of their lives. The house was a <lb/>
sunny old place, surrounded by maple and oak <lb/>
<pb n="110" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0141"/>
trees. From this haven, Mr. and Mrs. Mott <lb/>
ventured out into the city or nearby villages <lb/>
for meetings, conventions and a certain amount <lb/>
of necessary shopping. They usually drove in <lb/>
a neat square covered wagon built for two.</p>
<p>Mrs. Mott always did her shopping at the <lb/>
small, out-of-the-way stores, though she paid <lb/>
more for her purchases and had often to go <lb/>
long distances to get them. One anecdote is <lb/>
told of her in connection with this custom. She <lb/>
bought a child's high chair and had it put on to <lb/>
the cars. At her usual stopping place, a mere <lb/>
shed, the chair was put off. Contrary to <reg orig="cus-|tom">custom</reg>, <lb/>
no carriage met her, and there was no one <lb/>
in sight. Since she was afraid to leave the <lb/>
chair, she said to herself, with a little laugh, <lb/>
"It is not heavy," took off her bonnet, tied the <lb/>
strings together, hung it over her arm, and, <lb/>
placing the chair upside down on her head, <lb/>
walked across the fields to her house, nearly a <lb/>
quarter of a mile away!</p>
<p>She was always very unwilling to receive <reg orig="at-|tention">attention</reg>, <lb/>
and whenever her family remonstrated <lb/>
with her for going about so much alone, and <lb/>
offered to accompany her she would say: <lb/>
"No, thank thee, I do not want anyone. There <lb/>
is always somebody to help me in and out of <lb/>
cars and the conductors are very kind."</p>
<p>We may be sure that there was always <reg orig="some-|one">someone</reg> <lb/>
to help this dear Quaker gentlewoman with <lb/>
her radiant look. One friend said of her at <lb/>
this time: "Her face became like that of a <lb/>
transfigured saint."</p>
<pb n="111" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0142"/>
<p>Sometimes the Motts would spend days away <lb/>
from home at the trial of a fugitive slave. It <lb/>
is said that the effect of her presence was <lb/>
potent. One of the lawyers in the Dangerfield <lb/>
trial, when he was asked some years later how <lb/>
he dared to change his political opinions, <reg orig="re-|sponded">responded</reg>: <lb/>
"Do you think there is anything I <lb/>
dare not do after facing Lucretia Mott in that <lb/>
court room and knowing she wished me in <lb/>
hell?"</p>
<p>When there were no meetings or conventions <lb/>
James and Lucretia spent happy days at <lb/>
"Roadside." In the middle of the library, <reg orig="op-|posite">opposite</reg> <lb/>
the Franklin stove, stood her rocking <lb/>
chair and her two-shelved table covered with <lb/>
books, papers and writing materials, never <reg orig="dis-|turbed">disturbed</reg> <lb/>
by any hands but her own. Every <reg orig="morn-|ing">morning</reg> <lb/>
she sat here, after her regular work was <lb/>
done, first to glance over the newspaper, and <lb/>
then to write letters or to read. She read a <lb/>
great deal, but could never enjoy a book alone, <lb/>
if it really interested her. If her husband was <lb/>
out, she would step to the foot of the stairs <lb/>
and call for some member of the family to come <lb/>
down to share the pleasure with her. There <lb/>
was usually someone near at hand, for Mr. and <lb/>
Mrs. Mott had not lived alone since the early <lb/>
days of their married life.</p>
<p>On the tenth of Fourth Month, 1861, James <lb/>
and Lucretia Mott celebrated their golden <reg orig="wed-|ding">wedding</reg>. <lb/>
Children, grandchildren, and one tiny <lb/>
great-grandchild were present, and the wedding <lb/>
certificate, now yellow with age, was brought <lb/>
<pb n="112" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0143"/>
out and read aloud. The family noticed that <lb/>
a portion of the parchment had been torn away. <lb/>
Then Mrs. Mott was forced to admit that her <lb/>
hand had performed the desecration. Years <lb/>
before she had torn off the corner, because she <lb/>
needed some parchment with which to mend a <lb/>
battle-door for one of the children! This <lb/>
practical act was quite in accordance with the <lb/>
nature of the little woman who could drive for <lb/>
hours through the most lovely scenery without <lb/>
looking up from her knitting.</p>
<p>Mrs. Mott was always fragile, but her health <lb/>
at this time seemed failing. She wrote to her <lb/>
sister: "My day seems at times to be nearly <lb/>
over; but I shall patch up and mean to live as <lb/>
long as I can."</p>
<p>During the stirring days of the Civil War, <lb/>
Mrs. Mott was torn between her sympathy with <lb/>
Abolition and her condemnation of war. Her <lb/>
heart rejoiced when the great struggle was over <lb/>
and the negro had received his freedom. The <lb/>
close of the war meant also the end of the <reg orig="per-|secution">persecution</reg> <lb/>
which Mrs. Mott had endured for so <lb/>
many years. With the surrender at <reg orig="Appo-|mattox">Appomattox</reg> <lb/>
Court House, peace came into the ranks <lb/>
of the Friends. Some of those who had been <lb/>
most bitter in their feeling toward Mrs. Mott <lb/>
had died, and now that emancipation was an <lb/>
accomplished fact, all of the Friends were <reg orig="in-|clined">inclined</reg> <lb/>
to believe that they had always favored <lb/>
it. In spite of the loss of several who were <lb/>
dear to them, the life of the Motts was full of <lb/>
<pb n="113" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0144"/>
quiet happiness. They had lived to see their <lb/>
work appreciated.</p>
<p>This serene companionship came to an end <lb/>
in 1868. On the day before their wedding <reg orig="anni-|versary">anniversary</reg>, <lb/>
James Mott passed quietly away in a <lb/>
peaceful sleep; so peaceful that his wife did <lb/>
not recognize it as death. Worn with the <lb/>
night's watching, she laid her head beside his <lb/>
on the pillow and slept too.</p>
<p>Her sister Martha, in writing to a friend, <lb/>
concerning Lucretia said: "Though much <lb/>
broken by the heavy affliction that has come to <lb/>
her &hellip; she has borne the stroke better than <lb/>
was feared."</p>
<p>She took up her life again with patient <reg orig="brav-|ery">bravery</reg> <lb/>
and tried to fulfill her duties, but the sense <lb/>
of desolation remained with her to the end.</p>
<p>She continued to attend the yearly meetings <lb/>
of the Friends, and woman's rights <reg orig="conven-|tions">conventions</reg>. <lb/>
She was often invited to speak at these <lb/>
and other meetings, where her presence was <lb/>
looked upon as a benediction. At the <reg orig="centen-|nial">centennial</reg> <lb/>
anniversary of the old Pennsylvania <reg orig="Abo-|lition">Abolition</reg> <lb/>
Society she received a real ovation. <lb/>
After one or two speeches had been made, the <lb/>
president said:</p>
<p>"I propose now to present to you one of the <lb/>
most venerable and noble of the American <lb/>
women, whose voice for forty years has been <lb/>
heard and has tenderly touched many noble <lb/>
hearts. Age has dimmed her eye and weakened <lb/>
her voice, but her heart, like the heart of a wise <lb/>
<pb n="114" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0145"/>
man and a wise woman is yet young. I present <lb/>
to you Lucretia Mott."</p>
<p>As she stepped forward, the vast audience <lb/>
rose with tumultuous applause, cheering and <lb/>
waving hats and handkerchiefs. One who was <lb/>
present said that the scene could never be <reg orig="for-|gotten">forgotten</reg>; <lb/>
the frail little woman with a heavenly <lb/>
inspiration beaming from her face, standing <lb/>
there, motionless, waiting for the profound <reg orig="si-|lence">silence</reg> <lb/>
which followed.</p>
<p>She lived twelve years after her husband's <lb/>
death, and then, on the evening of the eleventh <lb/>
of Eleventh Month, after an illness of a week, <lb/>
she quietly went to join him.</p>
<p>The funeral service was simple and <reg orig="impres-|sive">impressive</reg>. <lb/>
At the burying ground several thousand <lb/>
people were gathered to pay the last act of <lb/>
friendship to her who had been a friend to so <lb/>
many. With the exception of a few words by <lb/>
Dr. Henry T. Childs, everything was conducted <lb/>
in profound silence. As all were standing by <lb/>
the open grave, a low voice impulsively said:</p>
<p>"Will no one say anything?"</p>
<p>Another responded: "Who can speak? <lb/>
The preacher is dead."</p>

<byline><hi rend="small-caps">by woodman bradbury</hi></byline>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> name of Fanny Crosby &lpar;Mrs. Frances <lb/>
Jane Van Alstyne&rpar; is bound up with the <lb/>
evangelism of the last half century. To hear <lb/>
her name is to think of gospel songs and to <lb/>
remember pleasantly the blind poet who wrote <lb/>
"Blessed Assurance," "Rescue the Perishing" <lb/>
and "Saved by Grace." Yet few, even of those <lb/>
who are especially interested in gospel <reg orig="hym-|nody">hymnody</reg>, <lb/>
realize the extent of her work. Her chief <lb/>
publishers possess five thousand five hundred <lb/>
of her hymns; and inasmuch as she declares <lb/>
that she must have written at least half as many <lb/>
more, she has the astonishing number of eight <lb/>
thousand religious poems to her credit!</p>
<p>"Hymns rarely have any serious value as <lb/>
poetry," said the late Professor Goldwin Smith. <lb/>
"There is nothing in them on which the <reg orig="cre-|ative">creative</reg> <lb/>
imagination can be exercised. Hymns <lb/>
can be little more than the incense of a <reg orig="worship-|ing">worshiping</reg> <lb/>
soul." Most critical readers will agree <lb/>
with Professor Smith; and if his dictum is true <lb/>
of the work of such great figures in Christian <lb/>
hymnody as Isaac Watts, James Montgomery <lb/>
and Charles Wesley, it applies with yet more <lb/>
<pb n="116" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0147"/>
truth to the prolific effusions of Miss Crosby. <lb/>
Great poetry her work is not. She is not <reg orig="suf-|ficiently">sufficiently</reg> <lb/>
gifted to produce it on any theme, apart <lb/>
from the limitations of hymn-writing. A great <lb/>
facility in rhyming and expressing the emotions <lb/>
of the Christian heart in regular rhythm which <lb/>
can be set to music is hers in marked degree. <lb/>
More for herself than this, she does not claim. <lb/>
But hers is "the worshiping soul" and her <lb/>
hymns are "the incense" which she, and <reg orig="count-|less">countless</reg> <lb/>
thousands of devout worshipers with her, <lb/>
offer to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus <lb/>
Christ.</p>
<p>Fanny Crosby was born in the little village of <lb/>
Southeast, Putnam County, New York, on <lb/>
March 24, 1820. Six weeks later she lost her <lb/>
eyesight. Her eyes became inflamed; Mr. <lb/>
Crosby called in a local physician who applied <lb/>
hot poultices, with the result that the baby's <lb/>
vision was destroyed. The popular indignation <lb/>
when this malpractice became known flamed so <lb/>
hot that the ill-educated doctor hurriedly left <lb/>
town for parts unknown. Fanny, herself, <reg orig="how-|ever">however</reg>, <lb/>
as she grew into girlhood, harbored no <lb/>
trace of resentment against him. She accepted <lb/>
her lot cheerfully, as a part of the will of God <lb/>
for her. Her natural buoyancy of disposition <lb/>
re&euml;nforced her Christian faith.</p>
<p>"Blindness," she wrote in later life, "can <lb/>
not keep the sunlight of hope from the <reg orig="trust-|ful">trustful</reg> <lb/>
soul. One of the easiest resolves that I <lb/>
formed in my young and joyous heart was to <lb/>
leave all care to yesterday, and to believe that <lb/>

<pb n="117" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0150"/>
the morning would bring forth its own peculiar <lb/>
joy." A wise and fruitful resolve!</p>
<p>Much of this elasticity of nature was <reg orig="doubt-|less">doubtless</reg> <lb/>
due to her splendid ancestry. Fanny <lb/>
Crosby was well born. She can trace the two <lb/>
lines of her ancestry back to the earliest New <lb/>
England stock. Her mother, who was also a <lb/>
Crosby, was descended from Simon Crosby <lb/>
who came to Boston in 1635 and was one of the <lb/>
founders of Harvard College, from which his <lb/>
son, Thomas, was graduated in 1653. Fanny's <lb/>
great-grandfather, Isaac Crosby, was the father <lb/>
of nineteen children. One of them was born <lb/>
while he was serving in the Revolutionary <lb/>
Army; whereupon he asked for a furlough on <lb/>
the ground that he had many children at home <lb/>
and "hadn't ever seen one of them." The <reg orig="fur-|lough">furlough</reg> <lb/>
was immediately granted. The records <lb/>
do not say whether, on his return to the army, <lb/>
he confessed in what sense his words were true. <lb/>
If he had the sensitive conscience of his <reg orig="de-|scendant">descendant</reg>, <lb/>
he doubtless did.</p>
<p>Fanny Crosby came naturally therefore by <lb/>
a sense of humor and a playful spirit. She <lb/>
was full of fun, joined the other children in <lb/>
play, and was likely to be deep in any <reg orig="mis-|chief">mischief</reg> <lb/>
that was going on. Taking the <reg orig="descrip-|tion">description</reg> <lb/>
of natural objects from her young <reg orig="com-|panions">companions</reg>, <lb/>
imagination made them as plain to her <lb/>
as sight did to them. She would leap over stone <lb/>
walls, play tag, climb trees with the agility of <lb/>
a cat, and ride the colts bareback across the <lb/>
fields. This vivid imagination was made <reg orig="pos-|sible">possible</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="118" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0151"/>
by senses of hearing and touch unusually <lb/>
graphic. Sounds of nature, for instance, were <lb/>
always a "feast" to her.</p>
<p>When a very little girl, a lamb was given to <lb/>
her as a playmate. They soon became <reg orig="insepa-|rable">inseparable</reg> <lb/>
friends. The lamb grew, however, as <lb/>
lambs will, and family necessities were insistent <lb/>
then, as now, though "the high cost of living" <lb/>
was not thought of. One day the lamb was <lb/>
missing; the next, the dinner table supported <lb/>
a savory roast on which the attention of all <lb/>
was ravenously centered. Not so, the little <lb/>
girl; she put two and two together and refused <lb/>
to eat the cannibalistic meat or to receive <reg orig="com-|fort">comfort</reg> <lb/>
of her elders. In a day or two her tears <lb/>
were dried; but when a neighbor offered her <lb/>
another lamb for a pet, she refused it. The <lb/>
pain of losing outweighed the joy of possessing. <lb/>
The child had not grown to the wise philosophy: <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>'Tis better to have loved and lost</l>
<l>Than never to have loved at all.</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>For solace, Fanny turned to the rose garden <lb/>
which she had always loved. She was allowed <lb/>
to pick whatever roses she wanted except from <lb/>
a certain white rose bush "in the midst of the <lb/>
garden." She would probably never have <lb/>
yielded to temptation by herself; but when her <lb/>
companions asked her for a white rose, she <lb/>
picked one for them. Her aunt saw her do it; <lb/>
and later in the day, she called Fanny and asked <lb/>
her if she had picked a white rose. Promptly <lb/>
<pb n="119" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0152"/>
came the answer, "No," although the child had <lb/>
never told an untruth before. The aunt took <lb/>
down the Bible and read the story of Ananias <lb/>
and Sapphira, without note or comment. But <lb/>
Fanny learned her life-long lesson that day.</p>
<p>At this period of her life, she began to learn <lb/>
Bible verses. Thereby her memory, which <lb/>
throughout life has been remarkable, was <lb/>
trained, and the foundation laid for her <reg orig="knowl-|edge">knowledge</reg> <lb/>
of the Bible, which was of such inestimable <lb/>
advantage to her as a hymn-writer. When <lb/>
there were competitions in reciting Bible verses <lb/>
either at home or at school, she was always <lb/>
victor. Evening after evening at twilight, she <lb/>
would sit on a favorite big brown rock and <lb/>
drink in the sounds of birds, crickets and the <lb/>
near-by waterfall, imagining the hues of the sky <lb/>
and softly repeating to herself all the verses <lb/>
of the Bible that came to her well stocked mind. <lb/>
The scene is a prophecy of the Christian poet <lb/>
that she became.</p>
<p>Although the little girl herself, probably <reg orig="be-|cause">because</reg> <lb/>
she did not know the poignancy of <reg orig="con-|trast">contrast</reg>, <lb/>
did not fret because of her sightlessness, <lb/>
Mrs. Crosby could not endure the thought of <lb/>
her daughter's blindness, if a cure could be <lb/>
effected. So a journey was planned to New <lb/>
York City to consult the great specialist, Dr. <lb/>
Valentine Mott. It was an adventurous journey <lb/>
to reach the Hudson River; then a trip of <reg orig="sev-|eral">several</reg> <lb/>
days in the sailboat, where the mother was <lb/>
seasick and little Frances played with the <reg orig="cap-|tain">captain</reg> <lb/>
and the crew who sang songs and spun <lb/>
<pb n="120" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0153"/>
"yarns." A young man and his cow were <reg orig="fel-|low">fellow</reg> <lb/>
passengers on the boat, the former too full <lb/>
of whiskey and the latter of milk. The drunken <lb/>
owner refused to milk the cow; but the captain <lb/>
ordered it done while the man's attention was <lb/>
diverted, and Mrs. Crosby, now happily <reg orig="recov-|ered">recovered</reg> <lb/>
from her seasickness, made a custard which <lb/>
all on board pronounced very good!</p>
<p>Thus, after a journey more fraught with <reg orig="in-|cident">incident</reg> <lb/>
and excitement than would now-a-days be <lb/>
crowded into a trip across the continent, they <lb/>
arrived in New York; and after a few days' <lb/>
rest, presented themselves to the renowned <lb/>
physician for his examination and verdict. <lb/>
"My child," he said, in tones memorable for <lb/>
their kindness, "you can never be made to see!" <lb/>
The loving mother was grief-stricken, but not <lb/>
so the child. Life had brought her much joy <lb/>
already; would not yet fuller joy come with the <lb/>
years? She could not but look forward with <reg orig="an-|ticipation">anticipation</reg> <lb/>
and courage. In that mood was born <lb/>
her first poem, written when she was eight years <lb/>
old: <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>Oh! what a happy soul I am!</l>
<l rend="indent">Although I cannot see,</l>
<l>I am resolved that in this world</l>
<l rend="indent">Contented I will be.</l>
<l>How many blessings I enjoy</l>
<l rend="indent">That other people don't!</l>
<l>To weep and sigh because I'm blind</l>
<l rend="indent">I cannot nor I won't.</l>
</lg></q>
If the reader smiles at the expressions, he must <lb/>
admire at least the sentiment.</p>
<pb n="121" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0154"/>
<p>To gain an education now became her <reg orig="con-|suming">consuming</reg> <lb/>
ambition. Her father had died when <lb/>
she was less than a year old, and the family <lb/>
resources were meager. At the age of fifteen, <lb/>
she was admitted to the New York Institute for <lb/>
the Blind and a new chapter in her life was <lb/>
begun. She did all she could to show her <reg orig="ap-|preciation">appreciation</reg> <lb/>
of the opportunities of this school. <lb/>
Because of her flow of spirits and ready <reg orig="com-|panionship">companionship</reg> <lb/>
she became a favorite among her <lb/>
blind companions. Her skill in versifying <lb/>
seemed remarkable to her mates who nearly <reg orig="suc-|ceeded">succeeded</reg> <lb/>
in turning her head with their praise. <lb/>
A wise teacher, seeing this danger, called her <lb/>
to his office and gave her wholesome truth about <lb/>
her poetry and herself. "Fanny, shun a <reg orig="flat-|terer">flatterer</reg> <lb/>
as you would a viper," he concluded.</p>
<p>Among the chief advantages in this school <lb/>
was the opportunity to meet distinguished <lb/>
people. Visitors from foreign lands and <reg orig="Amer-|ican">American</reg> <lb/>
notables paid visits to the Institute and <lb/>
were introduced to the students. William <reg orig="Cul-|len">Cullen</reg> <lb/>
Bryant read his poems, Horace Greeley was <lb/>
a frequent visitor, President Polk made a <lb/>
pleasant impression, and Gen. Winfield Scott <lb/>
caused a great flurry of excitement. Miss <lb/>
Crosby particularly liked Henry Clay; his voice <lb/>
was so sonorous and persuasive. For a time, <lb/>
the superintendent had a young assistant whom <lb/>
teachers and pupils learned to admire for his <lb/>
ability and strong sincerity. His name was <lb/>
Grover Cleveland; and as they followed his <lb/>
brilliant career from step to step, no one of <lb/>
<pb n="122" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0155"/>
them was surprised that he should become the <lb/>
President of the United States.</p>
<p>Less pleasant to record was the breaking out <lb/>
of cholera in the Institute. The epidemic raged <lb/>
fiercely in the city, and the hoarse cry: "Bring <lb/>
out your dead!" sounded grimly in the night <lb/>
hours. Many of the blind caught the infection <lb/>
and died. Miss Crosby herself had the initial <lb/>
symptoms one afternoon. Bravely she kept the <lb/>
news to herself, took the medicine, practiced <lb/>
the precautions which had been enjoined, <reg orig="com-|mitted">committed</reg> <lb/>
herself to God,&mdash;and woke in the <reg orig="morn-|ing">morning</reg> <lb/>
to find herself perfectly well! Those were <lb/>
dreadful days and left their scar upon the <lb/>
memory of those who passed through them.</p>
<p>After seven years of student life, Miss Crosby <lb/>
was graduated from the Institute, to return to it <lb/>
afterwards as teacher for eleven years, from <lb/>
1847 to 1858. In 1844, she launched her first <lb/>
volume of verse, under the title, <hi rend="italic">The Blind <lb/>
Girl and Other Poems.</hi> Many of these poems <lb/>
were autobiographical. Others were the <reg orig="ad-|dresses">addresses</reg> <lb/>
in poetic form with which she had <lb/>
greeted famous visitors to the Institute. <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Monterey and Other Poems</hi> followed in 1849. <lb/>
On the year of her marriage, 1858, she <reg orig="pub-|lished">published</reg> <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">A Wreath of Columbia's Flowers.</hi></p>
<p>The most significant occurrence in this period <lb/>
of her life was her conversion. Religious she <lb/>
had been from childhood up, but not until she <lb/>
was thirty-one years of age did she have that <lb/>
vital assurance of Christ's love and God's <reg orig="par-|don">pardon</reg> <lb/>
that she called her conversion. One night <lb/>
<pb n="123" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0156"/>
in a vivid dream, a warm friend of hers, who <lb/>
seemed to be dying, asked her, "Will you meet <lb/>
me in heaven?" It did not matter to find, on <lb/>
waking, that the friend was in sound health. <lb/>
The question had set her to thinking deeply. <lb/>
Shortly after she and her companions were <lb/>
singing, "Alas! and did my Saviour bleed" and <lb/>
and as they came to the line, "Here, Lord, I <lb/>
give myself away," she definitely offered <reg orig="her-|self">herself</reg> <lb/>
to God and a flood of light and joy ensued. <lb/>
She joined the Old John Street Methodist <lb/>
church. This experience became determinative <lb/>
of her inner life, of her lifework, and of the <lb/>
sentiment of her hymns.</p>
<p>Fanny Crosby was married to Mr. Alexander <lb/>
Van Alstyne in 1858. Like herself, he was <lb/>
blind and had been a teacher in the Institute <lb/>
for the Blind. He was musical, also, and their <lb/>
united lives made harmony for forty-four years, <lb/>
until his death in 1902. At his wish, she <reg orig="con-|tinued">continued</reg> <lb/>
to write under her maiden name by which <lb/>
she was already becoming widely known.</p>
<p>At the time of her marriage, Fanny Crosby <lb/>
was well started on what proved to be her <reg orig="life-|career">life-career</reg>, <lb/>
that of producing religious verse. In <lb/>
1851, Mr. George F. Root, important in the <reg orig="de-|velopment">development</reg> <lb/>
of music in America, wrote an air <lb/>
for which he needed words. She supplied them <lb/>
so acceptably that they collaborated in about <lb/>
sixty songs. All of these had a wide <reg orig="circula-|tion">circulation</reg> <lb/>
and some became the most successful songs <lb/>
of the period. Among them were "There's <lb/>
music in the air," <hi rend="italic">Hazel Dell, Rosalie, the</hi> <lb/>
<pb n="124" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0157"/>
<hi rend="italic">Prairie Flower</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Bird of the North</hi>, all <lb/>
sweet, sentimental songs warmly beloved a <reg orig="gen-|eration">generation</reg> <lb/>
ago and popular now.</p>
<p>Four years later <hi rend="italic">The Flower Queen</hi> was <lb/>
produced by them jointly. One day Mr. Root <lb/>
would tell in prose what he wanted the various <lb/>
flowers to say and hum the melody he had in <lb/>
mind; the next day Miss Crosby would have <lb/>
those sentiments expressed in rhyme, to fit the <lb/>
given melody. <hi rend="italic">The Flower Queen</hi> was the <lb/>
first American cantata and was frequently <reg orig="pro-|duced">produced</reg> <lb/>
in widely separated parts of the country. <lb/>
It gave popularity both to author and composer. <lb/>
Mr. Root's fame was still further enhanced by <lb/>
his war songs and Sunday school music.</p>
<p>Another composer with whom she was early <lb/>
thrown in contact was William B. Bradbury. <lb/>
He was a prolific composer for the Sunday <lb/>
school, a devout man who believed in <reg orig="consecrat-|ing">consecrating</reg> <lb/>
his talent to religious uses. Such tunes as <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Woodworth</hi> &lpar;"Just as I am"&rpar;, <hi rend="italic">Rest</hi> &lpar;"Asleep <lb/>
in Jesus"&rpar;, "Sweet Hour of Prayer," and "He <lb/>
leadeth me," are a worthy contribution to <lb/>
American hymnology and will preserve his <lb/>
name for many generations. Others like <lb/>
"Jesus, like a Shepherd lead us," "Even me," <lb/>
"The Solid Rock," were immensely popular in <lb/>
their day. Bradbury was a connecting link <reg orig="be-|tween">between</reg> <lb/>
the choral style of Greatorex and Lowell <lb/>
Mason on the one hand and the ballad style in <lb/>
sacred music which so soon became popular <lb/>
under the name of gospel songs.</p>
<p>When Mr. Bradbury was introduced to Miss <lb/>
<pb n="125" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0158"/>
Crosby, he was deeply impressed with her work. <lb/>
"I am surprised beyond measure," he said, <lb/>
"and as long as I have a publishing house, you <lb/>
will always have work." He had long desired <lb/>
such words as Miss Crosby could write. This <lb/>
promise was fulfilled, and her connection with <lb/>
the firm ran for more than forty years. Mr. <lb/>
Bradbury himself, however, did not long <reg orig="sur-|vive">survive</reg>. <lb/>
When he died, in 1868, his last words to <lb/>
her were, "Take up my life-work where I lay <lb/>
it down." At his funeral there was sung the <lb/>
first hymn they had done together, speeding his <lb/>
spirit to the land <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>Where the fields are robed in beauty</l>
<l>And the sunlight never dies.</l>
</lg></q>
Though their joint work was so short, she <reg orig="be-|came">became</reg> <lb/>
warmly attached to Mr. Bradbury; and <lb/>
thirty years after his death she said to a <reg orig="name-|sake">namesake</reg> <lb/>
of his: "Of all my friends, I loved him the <lb/>
best. When I get to heaven I am going to ask <lb/>
first for William B. Bradbury."</p>
<p>In these early years, she worked much for <lb/>
Philip Phillips, the singing evangelist, whose <lb/>
songs were collected in <hi rend="italic">The Singing Pilgrim.</hi> <lb/>
At one time he gave her a commission for forty <lb/>
hymns. These she did one by one, storing them <lb/>
all in her mind till all the forty were ready; <lb/>
not until then was the amanuensis called in. <lb/>
Not one of them was put on paper until all <lb/>
were done. As a feat of memory, that is truly <lb/>
remarkable, almost incredible. Later she <reg orig="re-|peated">repeated</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="126" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0159"/>
the feat, furnishing him with nearly as <lb/>
many more not one of which was committed to <lb/>
writing until all were finished.</p>
<p>Another of her collaborators was the <reg orig="Rever-|end">Reverend</reg> <lb/>
Robert Lowry; to his music she wrote one <lb/>
of her most inspired hymns&mdash;"All the Way my <lb/>
Saviour leads me." The spirit of trustfulness <lb/>
and joyous resignation in the poem, is aptly <lb/>
conveyed by the music as well.</p>
<p>With Mrs. E. L. Knapp, she has twice <reg orig="col-|laborated">collaborated</reg> <lb/>
most successfully. "Nearer the <lb/>
Cross, my Heart can say" and the world-famous <lb/>
"Blessed Assurance" are their joint work. <lb/>
The latter was written after Mrs. Knapp had <lb/>
played the melody over several times, asking <lb/>
what it "meant" to Miss Crosby. "It means <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">this!</hi>" was the answer; and thus the spirit of <lb/>
the music was caught and put into language. <lb/>
"Blessed Assurance" has been particularly <lb/>
welcome in camp and on the march, although <lb/>
all of Miss Crosby's songs, with their warm <reg orig="sen-|timent">sentiment</reg> <lb/>
and well-marked rhythm, have been very <lb/>
helpful among soldiers&mdash;and sailors, as well. <lb/>
The Soldier's Christian Association of the <lb/>
British Army has made constant use of them. <lb/>
During the South African war, many times <lb/>
when a group of soldiers would pass another, <lb/>
the salutation would be "Four-nine-four, <lb/>
boys," and the response would invariably be, <lb/>
"Six further on!" The key to these watchwords <lb/>
is found in the fact that number 494 in <hi rend="italic">Sacred <lb/>
Songs and Solos</hi> is "God be with you till we <lb/>
<pb n="127" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0160"/>
meet again"; and "six further on" is number <lb/>
500, "Blessed Assurance, Jesus is mine."</p>
<p>Much work as compelling as that done with <lb/>
Mrs. Knapp, Miss Crosby accomplished in <reg orig="col-|laboration">collaboration</reg> <lb/>
with William H. Doane. To mention <lb/>
such lines as "Pass me not, O Gentle Saviour," <lb/>
"Rescue the Perishing," "I am Thine, O <lb/>
Lord," "Jesus Keep me near the Cross," "To <lb/>
the Work, to the Work," and "Safe in the <lb/>
Arms of Jesus," is to realize the extent of the <lb/>
popular debt to both of these partners. The <lb/>
composition of the last named hymn is <reg orig="char-|acteristic">characteristic</reg> <lb/>
of Miss Crosby's readiness of <reg orig="achieve-|ment">achievement</reg>. <lb/>
Mr. Doane burst into her room on April <lb/>
30, 1868, and said, "There are just forty <lb/>
minutes before my train leaves for Cincinnati. <lb/>
Here is a melody. Can you write words for <lb/>
it?" Twenty minutes passed in silence broken <lb/>
only by the ticking of the clock, Mr. Doane <reg orig="wait-|ing">waiting</reg>, <lb/>
Miss Crosby thinking. Then she turned <lb/>
round to him. "It is all done," she said, and <lb/>
dictated her verses. He caught his train, <reg orig="bear-|ing">bearing</reg> <lb/>
with him words that were destined to bring <lb/>
comfort to thousands of people.</p>
<p>"Safe in the Arms of Jesus" became popular <lb/>
with great rapidity. That this hymn gave more <lb/>
peace and satisfaction to mothers who had lost <lb/>
their children than any other was the statement <lb/>
made by Dr. John Hall, the pastor of the Fifth <lb/>
Avenue Presbyterian church, New York. It has <lb/>
also been useful in causing repentance and a <lb/>
change of life. This incident, reported to Miss <lb/>
<pb n="128" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0161"/>
Crosby, is typical: "John," said a dying <lb/>
mother, looking up at him through tearful eyes, <lb/>
"sing to me once more 'Safe in the Arms of <lb/>
Jesus.'" The young man choked. "Mother," <lb/>
he said, "I can't sing that song. It would be <lb/>
a lie; I am not safe and I can not sing a lie." <lb/>
It is not surprising to know that that <reg orig="confes-|sion">confession</reg> <lb/>
of his need led him to Christ.</p>
<p>This was one of the first of the gospel hymns <lb/>
to be transcribed into foreign languages. <lb/>
"Once when laboring in London, I went to <lb/>
Basel, Switzerland, for a few days' rest," said <lb/>
Mr. Ira D. Sankey. "The evening I got there <lb/>
I heard under my window the most beautiful <lb/>
volume of song. I looked out and saw about <lb/>
fifty people, who were singing 'Safe in the <lb/>
Arms of Jesus' in their own language. I <lb/>
recognized the tune and spoke to them through <lb/>
an interpreter. The next evening I held a song <lb/>
service in an old French church in that city. <lb/>
The church was packed with people and many <lb/>
stood outside on the street."</p>
<p>Mr. Sankey figures in another typical <reg orig="inci-|dent">incident</reg>. <lb/>
In 1894, when Miss Crosby was at <reg orig="North-|field">Northfield</reg>, <lb/>
she was asked to make an address. At <lb/>
first she demurred, but finally consented and <lb/>
closed her remarks with the verses, "Some day <lb/>
the silver cord will break." The audience was <lb/>
much moved; and an English reporter who was <lb/>
present took down her hymn and published it <lb/>
in his London newspaper. Some time later, <lb/>
Mr. Sankey, who himself has successfully set <lb/>
some of her poems to music, saw the paper, cut <lb/>
<pb n="129" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0162"/>
out the verses and handed them to Mr. George <lb/>
C. Stebbins to be set to music. The inspiration <lb/>
came; and soon the world was singing, <lb/>
"Saved by Grace." A dramatic illustration of <lb/>
the effect of this hymn once surprised the staid <lb/>
worshipers of Christ Episcopal Church, <reg orig="Alle-|gheny">Allegheny</reg>, <lb/>
Pennsylvania. In the midst of a <reg orig="Sun-|day">Sunday</reg> <lb/>
morning service, a quietly dressed young <lb/>
woman of intellectual face arose and proceeded <lb/>
rapidly and eloquently to tell of her <reg orig="conver-|sion">conversion</reg>. <lb/>
As a little girl, she had attended Sunday <lb/>
school there; had married young and been <lb/>
drawn into a life of vanity, frivolity and <reg orig="world-|liness">worldliness</reg>; <lb/>
and had been brought back to God by <lb/>
hearing "Saved by Grace" sung at an out-door <lb/>
meeting. The congregation, at first a bit <lb/>
shocked, was visibly impressed with this <reg orig="narra-|tion">narration</reg>; <lb/>
and the rector, descending from the <reg orig="chan-|cel">chancel</reg>, <lb/>
took the speaker's hand, welcoming her <reg orig="re-|turn">return</reg>.</p>
<p>Very different from the religious atmosphere <lb/>
of Northfield were the surroundings which gave <lb/>
rise to another of Miss Crosby's great hymns. <lb/>
When Miss Crosby was visiting a mission in <lb/>
one of the worst slums of New York, her <reg orig="sym-|pathies">sympathies</reg> <lb/>
were kindled and the yearning of her <lb/>
heart found expression in "Rescue the <reg orig='Perish-|ing"&mdash;a'>Perishing"&mdash;a</reg> <lb/>
hymn which has become indispensable <lb/>
in rescue work of all sorts. Not only did Mr. <lb/>
Moody find it useful, but also temperance <lb/>
workers like Frances E. Willard and Francis <lb/>
Murphy. A drunken man, unshaven and dirty, <lb/>
staggered into this very mission one stormy <lb/>
<pb n="130" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0163"/>
night. After the audience had sung "Rescue <lb/>
the Perishing," the leader used illustrations <lb/>
drawn from his life as a soldier. At the <reg orig="meet-|ing's">meeting's</reg> <lb/>
close, this man walked unsteadily up to <lb/>
the front and asked:</p>
<p>"When were you in that company you spoke <lb/>
of?"</p>
<p>"Why, all through the war," said the leader.</p>
<p>"Do you remember the battle of Shiloh?"</p>
<p>"Perfectly."</p>
<p>"Do you remember your captain's name?"</p>
<p>"Yes, his name was Hamilton."</p>
<p>"You are right! I am that man! I was <lb/>
your captain. Look at me to-day and see what <lb/>
a wreck I am. Can you save your old <reg orig="cap-|tain">captain</reg>?"</p>
<p>He was saved that night and was soon helped <lb/>
by some of his former friends to get a <reg orig="respect-|able">respectable</reg> <lb/>
position, where his changed life bore <lb/>
eloquent testimony to the power of the gospel.</p>
<p>Of another sort was a man in Sussex, <reg orig="Eng-|land">England</reg>, <lb/>
who owes equally much to this hymn. "I <lb/>
believe I can attribute my conversion, through <lb/>
the grace of God, to one verse of that precious <lb/>
hymn, 'Rescue the Perishing,'" he says. "I <lb/>
was far away from my Saviour and living <reg orig="with-|out">without</reg> <lb/>
a Christian hope. I was fond, however, of <lb/>
singing hymns, and one day I came across this <lb/>
beautiful piece; and when I had sung the words, <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>Down in the human heart, crushed by the Tempter,</l>
<l rend="indent">Feelings lie buried that grace can restore;</l>
<l>Touched by a loving heart, wakened by kindness,</l>
<l rend="indent">Chords that were broken will vibrate once more,</l>
</lg></q>
<pb n="131" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0164"/>
I fell upon my knees and gave my heart to the <lb/>
Lord Jesus Christ. From that hour I have <lb/>
followed Him who, through this verse, touched <lb/>
my heart and made it vibrate with His praises <lb/>
ever since."</p>
<p>Can work done so rapidly as was Miss <reg orig="Cros-|by's">Crosby's</reg>, <lb/>
and turned out in such profusion be of <lb/>
the highest quality? Undoubtedly not. Most <lb/>
of Fanny Crosby's work is ephemeral. Much <lb/>
of it has already passed into oblivion and much <lb/>
of the remainder will pass away sooner or later. <lb/>
The church hymn-books designed for formal <lb/>
public worship do not contain her verses. She <lb/>
recognized the fact that so large an output <lb/>
would lower the value of her name; and her <lb/>
eight thousand hymns have appeared under a <lb/>
hundred or so different pseudonyms! If the <lb/>
reader comes across the names of Rose <reg orig="Ather-|ton">Atherton</reg>, <lb/>
Florence Booth, Ella Dale, Frances Hope, <lb/>
Ruth Harmon, Victoria Frances, let him pay <lb/>
mental homage to Fanny Crosby; and he will <lb/>
be surprised to learn that the same homage is <lb/>
due when he sees the names of James Apple, <lb/>
James Black, Rian J. Sterling, W. Robert <reg orig="Lind-|say">Lindsay</reg>, <lb/>
and others. Her achievement, be it noted <lb/>
in passing, is all the greater because she made <lb/>
such a valuable contribution to religious <reg orig="prog-|ress">progress</reg> <lb/>
with hymns many of which were not of the <lb/>
highest merit.</p>
<p>So large is the progeny of her brain that it <lb/>
is little cause for wonder that the mother can <lb/>
not remember all her children. One morning <lb/>
the congregation at Northfield sang with much <lb/>
<pb n="132" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0165"/>
gusto, "Hide me, O my Saviour." Miss <reg orig="Cros-|by">Crosby</reg>, <lb/>
who was sitting on the platform, liked it <lb/>
and turned to Mr. Stebbins to inquire the <reg orig="au-|thorship">authorship</reg>. <lb/>
But the meeting was breaking up <lb/>
and in the confusion he made no answer. The <lb/>
same hymn was sung in the afternoon and <lb/>
again she asked Mr. Stebbins the author's <lb/>
name. After making sure that she was in <reg orig="ear-|nest">earnest</reg>, <lb/>
he answered, "You are the guilty one!" <lb/>
For once, the wonderful memory had failed.</p>
<p>The theology of all these hymns is uniformly <lb/>
evangelical. Their author believes humanity <lb/>
to be sinful and in need of salvation; and she <lb/>
magnifies the love of God, the grace of Christ <lb/>
and the power of the Holy Spirit. The beauty <lb/>
of faith and of peace is painted in alluring <lb/>
tints and the glories of heaven described in <lb/>
glowing imagery drawn from Revelation. <lb/>
Every one of her hymns gives one aspect of the <lb/>
ever-fresh gospel. The central truth of her <lb/>
message in song is, "God so loved the world <lb/>
that He gave His only begotten Son, that <reg orig="who-|soever">whosoever</reg> <lb/>
believeth in Him should not perish but <lb/>
have everlasting life." Thus her songs form <lb/>
an appropriate atmosphere for evangelistic <lb/>
preaching: they produce conviction of sin and <lb/>
conversion. Of their far-reaching influence, <lb/>
only eternity can give the details.</p>
<p>Fanny Crosby has "tasted and seen that the <lb/>
Lord is good" and desires others to enjoy the <lb/>
same bountiful feast. Shut in from the <reg orig="dis-|tracting">distracting</reg> <lb/>
sights of the outer world, she has seen <lb/>
deeply into eternal truth and has put that truth <lb/>
<pb n="133" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0166"/>
into verse that has influenced countless <reg orig="thou-|sands">thousands</reg> <lb/>
of lives. Over fifty million copies of her <lb/>
gospel songs have been sold. During the last <lb/>
years of her life, Frances Ridley Havergal kept <lb/>
up a correspondence with Fanny Crosby, though <lb/>
they never met.</p>
<p>In these lines of Miss Havergal is <reg orig="admira-|tion">admiration</reg> <lb/>
of Miss Crosby for her spiritual insight, <lb/>
her resignation and her consecration: <lb/>
<q><lg type="stanza">
<l>Sweet blind singer over the sea,</l>
<l>Tuneful and jubilant, how can it be</l>
<l>That the songs of gladness, which float so far</l>
<l>As if they fell from an evening star,</l>
<l>Are the notes of one who may never see</l>
<l>"Visible music" of flower and tree?</l>
</lg>

<l>How can she sing in the dark like this?</l>

SISTER DORA</hi></head>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Occasionally</hi> in searching for the <reg orig="de-|velopment">development</reg> <lb/>
of great natures one finds that <lb/>
from their very faults, from the very <reg orig="tempera-|mental">temperamental</reg> <lb/>
obstacles against which they struggle, <lb/>
spring the sources of their greatness. So it <lb/>
was with Dorothy Wyndlow Pattison, with a <lb/>
will so strong that, although it often brought <lb/>
her into difficulties, it enabled her successfully <lb/>
to struggle through difficulties that would have <lb/>
overwhelmed a woman less determined. The <lb/>
very characteristic that sometimes became a <lb/>
stumbling block to her feet more often proved <lb/>
to be the means of the fulfillment of her <reg orig="as-|pirations">aspirations</reg>.</p>
<p>Dorothy Pattison, born January 16, 1832, in <lb/>
the little village of Hauxwell, near Richmond, <lb/>
in the North Riding of Yorkshire, was the <lb/>
eleventh child of a family of twelve. Her <lb/>
father was Reverend Mark James Pattison, a <lb/>
man who "walked with God." From him she <lb/>
inherited her shapely figure, while from her <lb/>
mother, the daughter of a Richmond banker, <lb/>
came her beauty of feature and coloring so <lb/>
much admired. As a child Dorothy was very <lb/>

<pb n="135" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0170"/>
delicate&mdash;a fact that kept her from regular <lb/>
lessons.</p>
<p>Her knowledge she picked up in scraps which <lb/>
she eagerly stored away in her retentive mind. <lb/>
In her childhood, as in her later life, she was <lb/>
quick to grasp a situation; her powers of <reg orig="ob-|servation">observation</reg> <lb/>
later stood her in good stead in the <lb/>
hospital ward. Among the country people she <lb/>
had the reputation of being a quiet child but <lb/>
it was due to the fact that she was not <reg orig="suffi-|ciently">sufficiently</reg> <lb/>
robust to throw herself into active <lb/>
sports. Delicate or not, she was by nature <lb/>
both mischievous and strong-willed, the leader <lb/>
in many escapades.</p>
<p>Upon one occasion she and one of her sisters <lb/>
had new Sunday bonnets which they did not <lb/>
like. In vain they pleaded not to wear them; <lb/>
the decree had gone forth that the <reg orig="bon-|nets">bonnets</reg> <lb/>
must be worn out. At last Dorothy's <lb/>
chance appeared in a pouring rainstorm which <lb/>
came up one day when Mr. and Mrs. Pattison <lb/>
were out. "Quick!" cried Dorothy to her <reg orig="sis-|ter">sister</reg>, <lb/>
"here is our chance for getting rid of the <lb/>
bonnets." On went the bonnets, and the <reg orig="chil-|dren's">children's</reg> <lb/>
heads were thrust out of the window <lb/>
until the distasteful headgear was completely <lb/>
ruined. When Sunday came, the two children <lb/>
appeared with no bonnets. Upon being sent <lb/>
for them they returned, confident and cheerful, <lb/>
with the wrecks upon their heads. "Why, <lb/>
mamma, we can't wear those," said Dorothy. <lb/>
But they did, not only for that day but for <lb/>
many a day afterwards!</p>
<pb n="136" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0171"/>
<p>In the parish, she was a general favorite. <lb/>
The Pattisons, as a family, were both <reg orig="chari-|table">charitable</reg> <lb/>
and hospitable towards their poor <reg orig="neigh-|bors">neighbors</reg>, <lb/>
and Dorothy shared with her sisters the <lb/>
work of carrying aid to the cottagers. The <lb/>
girls saved their pocket money and turned and <lb/>
remade their old dresses so that by spending <lb/>
less for clothes they might have more money <lb/>
to give. Sometimes when they were seated at <lb/>
the dinner table with the keen appetities of <reg orig="nor-|mal">normal</reg> <lb/>
children after a morning in the open air, a <lb/>
remark of the rector that poor So-and-So must <lb/>
be faring badly as Bill was out of work again <lb/>
would cause them to pack their own hearty <reg orig="din-|ner">dinner</reg> <lb/>
in a basket and take it to the suffering <lb/>
family, while they themselves dined on bread <lb/>
and cheese. They delighted to give, not only <lb/>
material things, but their time and practical <lb/>
sympathy. Once, when Dorothy was abroad, <lb/>
a schoolboy in the village became very sick <lb/>
with rheumatic fever. His one longing was to <lb/>
live to see "Miss Dora" again. On the day on <lb/>
which she returned he listened intently and long <lb/>
before anyone else could hear the carriage <lb/>
wheels he cried, "There she is," and waited <lb/>
with what patience he could command. He <lb/>
was not disappointed; at once she became his <lb/>
nurse and remained with him until he died.</p>
<p>As she grew older she outgrew the delicacy <lb/>
that had characterized her as a child, and with <lb/>
her newly-acquired strength she felt the need <lb/>
of action. Outdoor games and driving but most <lb/>
of all vigorous cross-country riding, she made <lb/>
<pb n="137" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0172"/>
an outlet for her overflowing energy. She <reg orig="be-|came">became</reg> <lb/>
a daring rider, followed the hounds with <lb/>
keen enjoyment, and cantered alone across the <lb/>
solitary moors.</p>
<p>At twenty, she was a picture of health, with <lb/>
a personal beauty that was obvious to the <reg orig="dull-|est">dullest</reg> <lb/>
eye. As she came back from a <reg orig="cross-coun-|try">cross-country</reg> <lb/>
gallop, with brown curls loosened, and the <lb/>
delicate color of her cheeks heightened by the <lb/>
sharp country wind, she was a picture at which <lb/>
all turned to look. To physical strength and <lb/>
beauty were united high animal spirits and a <lb/>
sense of humor, which, always sparkling out <lb/>
through her merry brown eyes, were to keep <lb/>
her sweet and strong through the trials of the <lb/>
years before her.</p>
<p>But the energy that caused her, when <reg orig="phys-|ically">physically</reg> <lb/>
able, as a child to tear vigorously <lb/>
through the house in strenuous games with her <lb/>
brothers and sisters, and, later, to enjoy so <lb/>
much a wild gallop upon a horse's back, now <lb/>
demanded some definite work upon which to <lb/>
spend its powers. A passive acceptance of life <lb/>
was foreign to her nature. She longed to be <lb/>
out and doing. Florence Nightingale's<ref target="n4" n="4">*</ref>
<note id="n4" place="foot" n="4"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>See Chapter V, page 120, <hi rend="italic">Heroines of Modern Progress.</hi></p></note>
 work <lb/>
in the Crimean war roused all her enthusiasm. <lb/>
She begged her father to let her go out to <lb/>
Scutari as a nurse, but upon his refusal she <lb/>
acquiesced with outward quietness. She <lb/>
slighted none of her duties, in the home or in <lb/>
the village, and spent much of her time in <reg orig="nurs-|ing">nursing</reg> <lb/>
her invalid mother. Sometimes she visited <lb/>
<pb n="138" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0173"/>
her oldest brother, Mark, at Redcar. When <lb/>
she was twenty-nine, her mother died, and thus <lb/>
Dorothy's chief work in the home was taken <lb/>
away from her.</p>
<p>At Choatham, near Redcar where she visited <lb/>
her brother, was an order of nursing sisters&mdash; <lb/>
the Sisterhood of the Good Samaritans. There <lb/>
they had established a convalescent hospital, <lb/>
and they devoted themselves to relieving the <lb/>
sickness of the poor of that neighborhood. In <lb/>
their example, Dorothy thought she had found <lb/>
the solution for her unsatisfied craving for a <lb/>
life of worth-while activity. Her father, <reg orig="how-|ever">however</reg>, <lb/>
was opposed to the idea of her entering <lb/>
the sisterhood; so for the time she gave it up. <lb/>
But she could not longer remain idle in <reg orig="com-|fort">comfort</reg>. <lb/>
Just at this time she saw an <reg orig="advertise-|ment">advertisement</reg> <lb/>
for a lady to take charge of the village <lb/>
school at Little Woolston, on the borders of <lb/>
Buckinghamshire, and in October, 1861, much <lb/>
against the wishes of her father, she left home <lb/>
to become a teacher.</p>
<p>Here she threw herself into the labors of a <lb/>
parish schoolmistress, but far in excess of her <lb/>
duties. She not only taught the children, but <lb/>
she visited them in their homes, nursed them <lb/>
when they were sick, played with them when <lb/>
they were well, told them wonderful stories, <lb/>
and in return was fervently loved by them. <lb/>
Nor did she stop there; her work extended to <lb/>
the poor and sick of the whole parish. If she <lb/>
was lonely, living by herself in a tiny cottage <lb/>
with no servant except an old woman who came <lb/>
<pb n="139" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0174"/>
in occasionally to scrub, she only threw herself <lb/>
harder into the work. Indeed, she probably <lb/>
overworked, and a neglected cold soon brought <lb/>
on an attack of pleurisy. When she grew a <lb/>
little better she was sent to Redcar to <reg orig="con-|valesce">convalesce</reg>; <lb/>
the associations there roused in her <lb/>
all the longings for a definite and settled life <lb/>
work&mdash;longings that had been steadily growing <lb/>
within her. This time her willfulness would <lb/>
brook no opposition; against the combined <lb/>
wishes of the members of her family, in the <lb/>
autumn of 1864, she became a sister of the <reg orig="or-|der">order</reg> <lb/>
of the Good Samaritans.</p>
<p>The Sisterhood of the Good Samaritans is <lb/>
what is termed a "secular" order affiliated with <lb/>
the Church of England. That is, it is a <reg orig="work-|ing">working</reg> <lb/>
order whose members are bound by no <lb/>
vows except one of a definite term of obedience <lb/>
to their pastor and to the "mother superior" <lb/>
appointed by him. To this order, then, <lb/>
Dorothy Pattison, henceforth Sister Dora, <lb/>
brought her burning ardor for work. Here she <lb/>
was put through a severe training, which, while <lb/>
distasteful to her at the time, undoubtedly not <lb/>
only made her proficient in the mechanical part <lb/>
of her profession but gave her lessons in <reg orig="self-|control">self-control</reg>. <lb/>
She learned to make beds and to <lb/>
cook; at first, when those in charge pulled to <lb/>
pieces the beds she had just made, she would <lb/>
sit down and cry for discouragement, but in the <lb/>
end her good sense conquered and she quickly <lb/>
learned to adopt the approved methods. A <lb/>
large part of her time was spent in a small <lb/>
<pb n="140" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0175"/>
cottage hospital in North Ormesbury, where <lb/>
she worked sometimes with another sister but <lb/>
often alone. On January 5, 1865, she writes <lb/>
from Ormesbury to a friend in Little <reg orig="Wools-|ton">Woolston</reg>: <lb/>
"I have been ordered off to the hospital <lb/>
to-day, and am sitting up to-night with a poor <lb/>
man who is suffering from concussion of the <lb/>
brain; and he alarms me by getting up and <lb/>
trying to get away, and he is insensible &lsqb;<hi rend="italic">i.e</hi>. not <lb/>
himself&rsqb;, so that it is useless speaking to him. <lb/>
It is so cold that, though sitting over the fire, <lb/>
I am shivering. I have put a blister on my <lb/>
patient. I hope, when it takes effect, there will <lb/>
be an improvement. I hope he won't die, for <lb/>
I am the only Sister here; the others have gone <lb/>
for their holiday."</p>
<p>She stayed at North Ormesbury until the <lb/>
early part of 1865, when she was sent to <reg orig="Wal-|sall">Walsall</reg>, <lb/>
in South Staffordshire, to assist in the <lb/>
work of a small cottage hospital there.</p>
<p>Walsall is an industrial town in the coal and <lb/>
iron district near Birmingham, on the outskirts <lb/>
of the "Black Country." By day it is <reg orig="sor-|did">sordid</reg> <lb/>
and dingy, but at night it glows with an <lb/>
awful splendor. The same smelting furnaces <lb/>
whose smoke daily blackens the landscape, at <lb/>
night glare through the darkness with a <reg orig="malig-|nant">malignant</reg> <lb/>
flaming red positively infernal. The <lb/>
smelting furnaces and the coalpits furnished <lb/>
work for most of the men in town. Accidents <lb/>
were numerous and medical aid was scarce; a <lb/>
hospital of some sort where the wounded <lb/>
could be taken for immediate treatment became <lb/>
<pb n="141" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0176"/>
a necessity. Accordingly, in 1863, a cottage <lb/>
hospital of four beds was established under <lb/>
the charge of Sister Mary of the Good <reg orig="Samari-|tans">Samaritans</reg>. <lb/>
By the time it was a year old the number <lb/>
of beds had increased to fourteen. Hither, <lb/>
in 1865, Sister Mary having fallen ill, came <lb/>
Sister Dora, as head of the hospital. <reg orig="Imme-|diately">Immediately</reg> <lb/>
after her arrival she caught smallpox <lb/>
from some of the outpatients and for a <lb/>
time was very ill. She was put in a small room <lb/>
whose window faced the street. At that time <lb/>
the little hospital was the victim of much <lb/>
opposition and even petty persecution from the <lb/>
very people it was there to help. Stones and <lb/>
mud were thrown at the window of the room <lb/>
where Sister Dora lay sick. Soon after her <reg orig="re-|covery">recovery</reg>, <lb/>
as she passed a crowd of roughs, <lb/>
one exclaimed: "There goes one of those <lb/>
Sisters of <hi rend="italic">Misery!</hi>" At the same time he <lb/>
threw a stone which cut her forehead. A <lb/>
short time later, the very fellow was badly <lb/>
hurt in a coalpit accident and was brought to <lb/>
the hospital, where Sister Dora nursed him <lb/>
with particular care. One day, when he had <lb/>
nearly recovered, she discovered him silently <lb/>
crying, and presently he penitently blurted out <lb/>
the whole story. To his surprise, he learned <lb/>
that Sister Dora had recognized him when he <lb/>
was brought in. This was his first experience <lb/>
with the Christian ideal of returning good for <lb/>
evil.</p>
<p>In April 1865, she was recalled to Choatham <lb/>
for a short time. Here the restraint and <reg orig="de-|corum">decorum</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="142" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0177"/>
imposed by the Sisterhood sometimes <lb/>
proved too much for her lively spirits. One <lb/>
day a donkey with the reputation of upsetting <lb/>
everybody was brought to the door of the <lb/>
home. "Oh, let me ride him," cried Sister <lb/>
Dora. "He won't kick me off." Tying her <lb/>
bonnet strings a little more tightly than usual, <lb/>
with her black skirts tucked up carefully around <lb/>
her, she mounted the beast and managed to <lb/>
stick for a while despite his most frantic <lb/>
efforts to throw her. It was a clash of two <lb/>
stubborn wills, but the brute strength of the <lb/>
donkey finally won and Sister Dora in spite of <lb/>
her proud boast was ignominiously thrown. <lb/>
She did penance for this prank, however, <reg orig="be-|cause">because</reg> <lb/>
for some days her knees were so bruised <lb/>
and swollen that they were very painful to kneel <lb/>
on. She had had her fun, however, and bore <lb/>
the pain in silence rather than confess her <reg orig="un-|dignified">undignified</reg> <lb/>
behavior to the mother superior.</p>
<p>It must not be supposed that her <reg orig="irrepress-|ible">irrepressible</reg> <lb/>
spirits were always thus in evidence. <lb/>
Just before coming to Walsall she had passed <lb/>
through the crisis of her religious life. She <lb/>
had never lost her sense of the nearness of God <lb/>
and a firm belief in the efficacy of prayer, but <lb/>
her intellectual judgment had become distorted. <lb/>
For a time her intelligence balked at believing <lb/>
the authenticity of the Scriptures and her <reg orig="at-|titude">attitude</reg> <lb/>
might well have been summed up "Lord, <lb/>
I believe; help Thou my unbelief." During <lb/>
this time she was aided and strengthened by <lb/>
Reverend Richard Twigg, rector of St. John's, <lb/>
<pb n="143" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0178"/>
Wednesbury, to whose church for early <reg orig="com-|munion">communion</reg> <lb/>
she walked almost every Sunday <reg orig="morn-|ing">morning</reg>. <lb/>
Large-hearted, large-minded, his life <lb/>
a living example of his faith, he steadied <lb/>
and held Sister Dora as no one else could. <lb/>
Among all the people she met during her stay <lb/>
in Walsall, Mr. Twigg was the one who, more <lb/>
than anyone else, was destined to help her most <lb/>
when she needed help. She emerged from this <lb/>
inner trial, however, with her whole being <reg orig="cen-|tered">centered</reg> <lb/>
around a deep personal love of her <lb/>
Saviour, Jesus Christ. Later she was to be <lb/>
tested and it was this sincere devotion to her <lb/>
Lord that brought her out triumphant.</p>
<p>Her always strong desire to help others was <lb/>
re&euml;nforced by the inward peace and sense of <lb/>
love she now felt. She had inherited a <reg orig="com-|paratively">comparatively</reg> <lb/>
large income but she spent it chiefly <lb/>
on others; her own wants were very simple. <lb/>
Work and prayer seemed to be the two rules <lb/>
of her life and it would be hard to say which <lb/>
predominated.</p>
<p>It was this spirit that she carried with her <lb/>
back to Walsall after her second brief stay at <lb/>
Choatham. There she took up her work again <lb/>
quietly and unobtrusively. For a long time <lb/>
the prosperous and healthy hardly knew of <lb/>
her. Only in the slums, in the back allies where <lb/>
ignorance and dirt fought a winning fight <lb/>
against health, she was known by those whom <lb/>
she sought out&mdash;those so miserable that they <lb/>
would not, even for relief, obtrude themselves <lb/>
at the hospital. It is no wonder that they <lb/>
<pb n="144" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0179"/>
learned to love her who healed their bodies <lb/>
even as she prayed for their souls. So she <lb/>
moved in and out among them, in all kinds of <lb/>
weather, at all hours, never considering <reg orig="her-|self&mdash;indeed">herself&mdash;indeed</reg> <lb/>
throwing herself into her work <lb/>
with such impetuous eagerness that in 1866 she <lb/>
had a serious illness; for three weeks her life <lb/>
was in danger. Then the people of Walsall <lb/>
found out what Sister Dora meant to the <lb/>
town. The hospital was besieged with <reg orig="in-|quiries">inquiries</reg>, <lb/>
and she herself always felt that her <lb/>
recovery was due to the prayers of the <reg orig="con-|gregation">congregation</reg> <lb/>
of St. John's, Wednesbury, where <lb/>
she attended church.</p>
<p>The usefulness of the hospital increased <lb/>
steadily, and under her adequate care, gave <lb/>
great relief to the community. The small, <lb/>
fourteen-bed building soon proved to be <reg orig="insuffi-|cient">insufficient</reg>. <lb/>
Always poorly ventilated, it became so <lb/>
impregnated with infection that wounds refused <lb/>
to heal, and case after case was sent away <reg orig="un-|cured">uncured</reg>. <lb/>
The committee in charge resolved to <lb/>
build one larger and better. In this <reg orig="under-|taking">undertaking</reg> <lb/>
they not only had Sister Dora's approval <lb/>
but, to a great extent, her financial aid, and <lb/>
thanks to her assistance the new hospital was <lb/>
ready for occupancy in 1868. It was situated <lb/>
on a hill, with good ventilation, and had <reg orig="twenty-|eight">twenty-eight</reg> <lb/>
beds with room for more if needed. Just <lb/>
as patients and nurses were well settled in their <lb/>
new quarters, a smallpox epidemic broke out. <lb/>
Sister Dora's efforts were now redoubled. <lb/>
Every minute that she could spare from her <lb/>
<pb n="145" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0180"/>
hospital duties she spent nursing the victims <lb/>
in their homes. Often she would be the only <lb/>
one in the house besides the sick person. One <lb/>
night she found a man dying with "blackpox" <lb/>
&mdash;smallpox in its most virulent form. There <lb/>
was no light in the house but a small <reg orig="candle-|end">candle-end</reg>; <lb/>
so giving a neighbor some money she <lb/>
asked her to get a light of some sort. The <lb/>
woman did not come back; as the miserable bit <lb/>
of candle flickered down, the dying man raised <lb/>
himself, saying: "Sister, do not leave me <reg orig="be-|fore">before</reg> <lb/>
I die." She took him in her arms, and in <lb/>
total darkness she sat on through the long night <lb/>
even after he had died, until the dawn came.</p>
<p>In course of time the epidemic was over, and <lb/>
work settled down to its accustomed routine. <lb/>
From the beginning of her hospital career <reg orig="Sis-|ter">Sister</reg> <lb/>
Dora had determined to become an efficient <lb/>
surgical nurse. The old surgeon of the <reg orig="hos-|pital">hospital</reg>, <lb/>
seeing her cool and sensible courage, had <lb/>
taught her as much as he could. She <reg orig="under-|took">undertook</reg> <lb/>
more and more of the minor cases and <lb/>
gradually came to set all the fractures. She <lb/>
was an advocate of conservative surgery and <lb/>
invariably voted against amputation if there <lb/>
seemed even a chance of saving the limb. One <lb/>
night a young man was brought in whose arm <lb/>
had been caught in his machine and so badly <lb/>
torn and twisted that the physician declared it <lb/>
must be amputated immediately. Sister Dora's <lb/>
sympathy was aroused by the young fellow's <lb/>
groan of despair. He turned from the doctor <lb/>
to her kindly face and implored her to save <lb/>
<pb n="146" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0181"/>
him. She examined the wound attentively; <lb/>
the young workman's face showed that he had <lb/>
led a clean and wholesome life. She told the <lb/>
doctor she thought she could save the arm. <lb/>
He replied flatly that amputation was <reg orig="neces-|sary">necessary</reg>, <lb/>
and refused to have another thing to do <lb/>
with the case. On her own responsibility, <reg orig="Sis-|ter">Sister</reg> <lb/>
Dora undertook to save the arm. After <lb/>
three weeks of tense anxiety on her part, she <lb/>
called the physician and showed him the arm <lb/>
progressing rapidly towards its old time <reg orig="use-|fulness">usefulness</reg>. <lb/>
With pride the surgeon who had <lb/>
taught her brought the hospital staff to show <lb/>
them what might be done. The patient <reg orig="there-|after">thereafter</reg> <lb/>
went by the name of "Sister's Arm."</p>
<p>Sister Dora had been doing all the nursing, <lb/>
the wardwork, and sometimes even the <reg orig="cook-|ing">cooking</reg>, <lb/>
but the work had increased so much that <lb/>
she was now obliged to have help. <reg orig="Accord-|ingly">Accordingly</reg>, <lb/>
with the consent of the committee, she <lb/>
took a small number of "lady-pupils" to teach <lb/>
the rudiments of nursing. As a teacher she <lb/>
was not wholly successful; she was rather <reg orig="im-|patient">impatient</reg>, <lb/>
preferring to do the task herself than <lb/>
to go through the tedious process of showing <lb/>
others how to do it. The difficulty was that <lb/>
she did not have the power of organizing the <lb/>
efforts of others, and her own personality was <lb/>
so great that it had overshadowed all lesser <lb/>
endeavors. "The main lesson which her <reg orig="lady-|pupils">lady-pupils</reg> <lb/>
carried away from Walsall, was not how <lb/>
to dress wounds or how to bandage, or even <lb/>
how to manage a hospital on the most popular <lb/>
<pb n="147" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0182"/>
as well as on the most economical method, but <lb/>
rather the mighty results which the motive <lb/>
power of love towards God, and for His sake, <lb/>
towards mankind, might enable one single <lb/>
woman to effect."</p>
<p>A great deal of her work was done for <reg orig="chil-|dren">children</reg>, <lb/>
with whom she was an especial favorite. <lb/>
Often she would carry the littlest one around <lb/>
on one arm, while she made beds, prepared <lb/>
medicine, or did other hospital work. To the <lb/>
fretful she would say, "Don't you cry; Sister's <lb/>
got you!" Burns were perhaps the <reg orig="common-|est">commonest</reg> <lb/>
cases which the hospital had to treat. <reg orig="Chil-|dren">Children</reg> <lb/>
were brought almost frantic with terror <lb/>
and pain. When such a case came in, she would <lb/>
drop whatever work was in hand and bend all <lb/>
her energies to soothing the frightened child. <lb/>
After she had calmed the small sufferer she <lb/>
would dress the wounds. If the child was <lb/>
plainly dying she would tell it in a simple way <lb/>
about Jesus, the children's friend, until the <lb/>
child died peacefully and happily, as did one <lb/>
nine year old girl whose last words were: <lb/>
"When you come to heaven, Sister, I'll meet <lb/>
you at the gates with a bunch of flowers."</p>
<p>Thus, simply, she talked to the children of <lb/>
Christ. Unless for some definite purpose, <lb/>
however, she never talked about her religion <lb/>
to strangers, but when occasion arose she was <lb/>
not afraid to bear witness to her faith. Once, <lb/>
when she was riding in the third class carriage <lb/>
of a train, four or five drunken men got on at <lb/>
one of the way stations. At last Sister Dora <lb/>
<pb n="148" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0183"/>
could bear their foul language no longer; rising <lb/>
to her full height&mdash;a commanding figure in her <lb/>
plain black dress and little white bonnet&mdash;she <lb/>
said: "I will not hear the Master whom I <lb/>
serve spoken of in this way." One of them <lb/>
dragged her to her seat and bade her keep still. <lb/>
Having made her protest she wisely saw the <lb/>
folly of any further action. When she got out <lb/>
at her station, however, one of the men came <lb/>
up to her and bade her shake hands for she was <lb/>
"a rare plucky one!"</p>
<p>In this and in many other instances she was <lb/>
"plucky" with the courage that comes from <lb/>
faith. Her creed was that of the Church of <lb/>
England, but she had a broad tolerance for all <lb/>
sects; indeed she often confessed a liking for <lb/>
slightly "sensational" religion. She attended <lb/>
with keen interest a Moody and Sankey revival <lb/>
and afterwards used their hymn book in her <lb/>
hospital. The Oxford Movement, which had <lb/>
stirred all England during her childhood, left <lb/>
her undisturbed. She felt no need of ritual in <lb/>
her worship, and, on the whole, was perhaps a <lb/>
little scornful of it. The Bible was her <reg orig="con-|stant">constant</reg> <lb/>
companion, a marked copy being always <lb/>
with her; a "lady-pupil" who came upon her <lb/>
while she was quietly reading it describes her <lb/>
expression as "unearthly."</p>
<p>And now came the test of Sister Dora's faith. <lb/>
A gentleman connected with the hospital wished <lb/>
to marry her. He was a man of great <reg orig="intellec-|tual">intellectual</reg> <lb/>
power, but lacked one vital possession&mdash; <lb/>
the Christian faith. Although Sister Dora was <lb/>
<pb n="149" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0184"/>
attracted to him personally, she felt that it <lb/>
would be wrong for her to marry a professed <lb/>
unbeliever. Mr. Twigg of St. John's, who had <lb/>
helped her before, came to her aid again. <lb/>
There could be but one decision: she put away <lb/>
this earthly love that she might better attain <lb/>
to the heavenly. The strain, however, <reg orig="com-|bined">combined</reg> <lb/>
with her continuous hard work proved <lb/>
almost too much for her. One day she fainted <lb/>
while making up a bed in the ward and for a <lb/>
month was dangerously ill. During this illness <lb/>
perhaps no inquiry was more typical than that <lb/>
of the man nicknamed "Sister's Arm." Each <lb/>
Sunday morning he walked eleven miles to the <lb/>
hospital, pulled the bell with a hard jerk and <lb/>
said to the maid, "How's Sister?" Then he <lb/>
would say, "Tell her that's <hi rend="italic">her</hi> arm that rang <lb/>
the bell," and walk the eleven miles back.</p>
<p>One day, after she had been ill a month, she <lb/>
heard there was to be a serious operation <reg orig="per-|formed">performed</reg> <lb/>
that morning. When the doctors were <lb/>
ready to operate Sister Dora appeared in her <lb/>
old place, and from that time resumed her work <lb/>
with increased vigor. A picture given by one <lb/>
of the "lady-pupils" of the daily hospital <lb/>
routine shows Sister Dora down in the wards <lb/>
at half-past eight in the morning, making beds, <lb/>
giving the patients their breakfast, reading <lb/>
prayers, doing the regular routine of the wards <lb/>
&mdash;"the bright sunshiny way she always worked, <lb/>
with a smile and a pleasant word for everyone, <lb/>
was in itself a medicine of the best kind"&mdash; <lb/>
dressing wounds, caring for the out-patients, <lb/>
<pb n="150" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0185"/>
serving the patients' dinner&mdash;which she <reg orig="her-|self">herself</reg> <lb/>
always carved&mdash;prayers again, for the <lb/>
nurses and servants this time, and seeing <reg orig="out-|patients">outpatients</reg> <lb/>
until it was time for the afternoon <lb/>
tea.</p>
<p>As the hospital was small, there was <reg orig="neces-|sarily">necessarily</reg> <lb/>
a large number of out-patients, for only <lb/>
those who could not be treated otherwise were <lb/>
admitted to the wards. One day a woman came <lb/>
in with a gash in her head caused by a drunken <lb/>
husband. As Sister Dora was bandaging it <lb/>
the woman broke out fiercely against her <reg orig="hus-|band">husband</reg>. <lb/>
She would not stand his abuse any <lb/>
longer, she declared. She was going to have <lb/>
him arrested that very day. "Do you really <lb/>
mean it?" asked Sister Dora. "Indeed I do," <lb/>
said her patient. Whereupon Sister Dora took <lb/>
off the bandage she had just put on and bound <lb/>
the broken head up again much more <reg orig="elabo-|rately">elaborately</reg> <lb/>
than before. "Why did you do that?" <lb/>
asked a curious "lady-pupil" later. "Oh," <lb/>
said Sister Dora, her eyes twinkling, "I thought <lb/>
if she did have him arrested the judge would <lb/>
give him another month on account of that <reg orig="sec-|ond">second</reg> <lb/>
bandage." Such incidents as this <reg orig="en-|livened">enlivened</reg> <lb/>
somewhat the rather dreary work of <lb/>
the day.</p>
<p>After the nurses' tea, about half-past five or <lb/>
six was the pleasantest part of the day, for <lb/>
then she talked cheerily to each patient or else <lb/>
someone would play the harmonium and they <lb/>
would all sing hymns. To quote one of the <lb/>
pupils: "Nobody had ever seen such a woman <lb/>
<pb n="151" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0186"/>
as this before, so beautiful, so good, so <reg orig="tender-|hearted">tenderhearted</reg>, <lb/>
so strong and so gentle, so full of fun <lb/>
and humor, and of sympathy for broken hearts <lb/>
as well as for every other kind of fracture, and <lb/>
the best friend that many of these poor maimed <lb/>
men had ever known." Then wounds would <lb/>
be dressed for the night, the patients given <lb/>
their supper; after she finished her round of <lb/>
duties she would always read evening prayers <lb/>
for the patients. It did not matter to her that <lb/>
many of them were asleep. In her own words: <lb/>
"The prayers go up for them all the same." <lb/>
This was the record of a day's routine in her <lb/>
hospital&mdash;now truly hers, for in 1874 relations <lb/>
were finally and completely severed between <lb/>
Sister Dora and the Sisterhood of the Good <lb/>
Samaritans. What she said to a friend who <lb/>
was engaging for her a servant for the hospital <lb/>
best expresses her ideal for it: "Tell her this <lb/>
is not an ordinary house, or even hospital; I <lb/>
want her to understand that all who serve here, <lb/>
in whatever capacity, ought to have one rule, <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">love for God</hi>, and then I need not say love for <lb/>
their work. I wish we could use and really <lb/>
mean the word <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italic">Maison-Dieu</hi></foreign>."</p>
<p>She was a great believer in prayer and many <lb/>
a man has awakened at night to find her <reg orig="kneel-|ing">kneeling</reg> <lb/>
by his bed quietly praying for him. It has <lb/>
been said of a certain great surgeon who has <lb/>
recently died that before he performed any <lb/>
operation he paused for a moment's prayer. <lb/>
Of Sister Dora it is true that before attending <lb/>
to any wound she first prayed that, through her <lb/>
<pb n="152" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0187"/>
as the instrument, God in his loving kindness <lb/>
would effect a cure. She had a great respect <lb/>
for the presence of death, and the doctor's <reg orig="as-|sistants">assistants</reg> <lb/>
no longer smoked and jested at <reg orig="post-|mortem">postmortem</reg> <lb/>
examinations when she was present. <lb/>
On all practical subjects connected with the <lb/>
hospital she brought to bear her great intellect, <lb/>
and to the committees she was the final <reg orig="author-|ity">authority</reg>, <lb/>
and in all contentions, it was Sister Dora, <lb/>
who, calm and clear-sighted, settled the <reg orig="difficul-|ties">difficulties</reg>.</p>
<p>A word must be said of the two missions that <lb/>
were held while she was at Walsall. The first <lb/>
was in 1873. These "missions" of the Church <lb/>
of England are a form of evangelistic "revival <lb/>
meetings." It is a special effort, concentrated <lb/>
through a week or two of powerful appeal, to <lb/>
quicken spiritually those within the church and <lb/>
to bring those outside to a knowledge of the <lb/>
love of God and of his power to save sinners. <lb/>
On the second night of this first mission, Sister <lb/>
Dora went out into the streets to bring in those <lb/>
who would not come by themselves, and entered <lb/>
the church with thirty or forty in her train. <lb/>
The second mission was held in 1876, and she <lb/>
prepared to work for it more earnestly than <lb/>
for the first.</p>
<p>With her as guide, two of the clergy went into <lb/>
the worst parts of Walsall. One night the <lb/>
whole company in a saloon, including fifteen or <lb/>
twenty hardened women, went down on their <lb/>
knees while she prayed aloud for these "<reg orig="broth-|ers">brothers</reg> <lb/>
and sisters." While the mission lasted, <lb/>
<pb n="153" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0188"/>
Sister Dora and one clergyman held midnight <lb/>
services in a little hall in the heart of the slums, <lb/>
and even after the mission ended Sister Dora <lb/>
continued its work under her own direction. <lb/>
A short service was held late every Sunday <lb/>
night and she would go out personally into the <lb/>
homes of these dissolute men and women and <lb/>
bring them to the service. In all this there was <lb/>
an element of risk, of positive danger, but a <lb/>
rough, "Shut up, you fool&mdash;it's Sister Dora," <lb/>
was enough to forestall any violence.</p>
<p>The year preceding this last mission had been <lb/>
marked by a second outbreak of smallpox in <lb/>
Walsall. After the last epidemic the city <reg orig="au-|thorities">authorities</reg> <lb/>
built an epidemic hospital on the <reg orig="out-|skirts">outskirts</reg> <lb/>
of the town. The difficulty now was to <lb/>
get the people to go to it. They would rather <lb/>
die at home, they said, and those whose relatives <lb/>
were stricken concealed them. Sister Dora, <lb/>
seeing that the spread of the disease was <reg orig="un-|avoidable">unavoidable</reg> <lb/>
under the circumstances, wrote to the <lb/>
authorities that she would nurse the smallpox <lb/>
patients. Thus the difficulty was overcome, for <lb/>
people knew that where Sister Dora was they <lb/>
could trust their relatives. So she dropped <lb/>
her own work and went to take up that of the <lb/>
epidemic hospital, knowing that she herself <lb/>
might take the disease, and with a firmly-fixed <lb/>
presentiment that she might not return alive.</p>
<p>The only help she could get at this hospital <lb/>
was from an old porter&mdash;who would often get <lb/>
drunk and go off for the night&mdash;and two old <lb/>
women from the workhouse. In a letter she <lb/>
<pb n="154" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0189"/>
says: "I came and opened the smallpox <reg orig="hos-|pital">hospital</reg> <lb/>
on Saturday. It was spreading in the <lb/>
town, and no one could be found to come; also <lb/>
the people could not be persuaded to come until <lb/>
they heard I was here. &hellip; &lsqb;For help&rsqb;, I have <lb/>
got two 'critters' from the workhouse; one is <lb/>
so helpless, I have to do work for her, and the <lb/>
other sits up at nights so can do no more. &hellip; <lb/>
They &lsqb;the patients&rsqb; are all so pleased to have <lb/>
me here. I had such a nice Sunday. God's <lb/>
blessing seems very much on the place. I spoke <lb/>
to them. &hellip; Oh, that I had Mr. Twigg's power <lb/>
to help souls! I know you will all pray for <lb/>
me that, living or dying, I may glorify Him. <lb/>
You must not fret for me." Later she writes: <lb/>
"I rejoice that He has permitted one so <reg orig="un-|worthy">unworthy</reg> <lb/>
to work for Him; and oh, if He should <lb/>
think me fit to lay down my life for Him, rejoice, <lb/>
rejoice at so great a privilege. My heart is <lb/>
running over with thankfulness, and as I toil <lb/>
on I seem to hear the still small voice, 'Ye did <lb/>
it unto Me.' &hellip; Oh, don't talk about my life. <lb/>
If you knew it you would be down on your knees <lb/>
crying for mercy for me, a sinner." "I do <lb/>
miss my Sundays. &hellip; If it were not for the <lb/>
thought 'where two or three are gathered <reg orig="to-|gether">together</reg>, <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">there</hi> am <hi rend="italic">I</hi> in the midst,' I do not know <lb/>
what I should do. &hellip; I think I may almost say <lb/>
it is a closer walk with God. With the pestilence <lb/>
all around you cannot help living each day as if <lb/>
it were your last. There has come that peace <lb/>
which the world cannot give. If I had a wish, <lb/>
it would be that He would count me worthy to <lb/>
<pb n="155" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0190"/>
lay down my life for Him." To her patients at <lb/>
her own hospital she writes, after having <reg orig="re-|membered">remembered</reg> <lb/>
each one personally: "Have you <lb/>
been singing to-day? You must sing <reg orig="particu-|larly">particularly</reg> <lb/>
'Safe in the arms of Jesus,'<ref target="n5" n="5">*</ref>
<note id="n5" place="foot" n="5"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>For the account of the origin of this hymn, see Chapter <lb/>
V, page 127.</p></note>
 and think of <lb/>
me. Living or dying, I am His. Oh, my <reg orig="chil-|dren">children</reg>, <lb/>
you all love me for the very little I do <lb/>
for you; but, oh, if you would only think what <lb/>
Jesus has done, and is doing for you, your <lb/>
hearts would soon be full of love for Him, and <lb/>
you would all choose Him for your Master. <lb/>
Now, whilst you are on your beds, read and <lb/>
study His life; see the road He went, and <reg orig="fol-|low">follow</reg> <lb/>
Him. I know you all want to go to heaven, <lb/>
but wishing will not get you there. You <hi rend="italic">must</hi> <lb/>
choose <hi rend="italic">now</hi> in this life; you cannot choose <reg orig="here-|after">hereafter</reg> <lb/>
when you die. That great multitude St. <lb/>
John saw round the throne <hi rend="italic">had</hi> washed their <lb/>
robes and made them white in the blood of the <lb/>
Lamb, which was shed for each one of you. <lb/>
God loves you; I know it, by His letting you get <lb/>
hurt and bringing you to the hospital. 'As <lb/>
many as I <hi rend="italic">love</hi>, I rebuke and <hi rend="italic">chasten</hi>.' Think <lb/>
over these things my dear children. Your <lb/>
mother is thinking of you and praying for you. <lb/>
And if it please God you should never see her <lb/>
again, will you make up your minds to walk in <lb/>
the narrow way, so that we may all meet in the <lb/>
green fields above? May God bring you all <lb/>
safe there is the earnest prayer of your faithful <lb/>
friend, Sister Dora."</p>
<pb n="156" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0191"/>
<p>After six months of this steady and confining <lb/>
service, in spite of her presentiment, she <reg orig="re-|turned">returned</reg> <lb/>
to them and resumed her work quietly. <lb/>
Just two months after her return in October, <lb/>
1875, there was an explosion of one of the <reg orig="smelt-|ing">smelting</reg> <lb/>
furnaces. Eleven men fearfully burned by <lb/>
molten metal, were carried to the hospital, which <lb/>
turned out all but its worst cases to make room <lb/>
for them. Night and day, for ten days Sister <lb/>
Dora worked, cutting away the clothing that <lb/>
would adhere to the burnt flesh, bandaging <lb/>
wounds, and giving what little relief was <reg orig="pos-|sible">possible</reg>. <lb/>
Many people came to offer their help <lb/>
but could not endure the terrible sights and <lb/>
odor. This accident gave the hospital its <reg orig="death-|blow&mdash;it">deathblow&mdash;it</reg> <lb/>
had become fatally infected, and the <lb/>
committee finally determined to pull it down <lb/>
and build a larger new one. In the meantime <lb/>
they fitted up a small house in Bridgeman Street <lb/>
as a temporary hospital.</p>
<p>In this temporary hospital during the winter <lb/>
of 1876-7, Sister Dora began to notice in <reg orig="her-|self">herself</reg> <lb/>
a weakness foreign to her perfect health. <lb/>
Always strong, she had been in the habit of <lb/>
picking up her patients or carrying a dead body <lb/>
without particular effort. Although now only <lb/>
with increased effort, she continued her heavy <lb/>
work until the trouble grew so that she was <lb/>
forced to consult a doctor. There, in the <reg orig="doc-|tor's">doctor's</reg> <lb/>
office, she entered the outskirts of the <reg orig="val-|ley">valley</reg> <lb/>
of the shadow. Although she had concealed <lb/>
her illness up to the last possible moment, she <lb/>
<pb n="157" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0192"/>
had begun then to feel the inroads of a <reg orig="malig-|nant">malignant</reg> <lb/>
cancer.</p>
<p>All through that winter she worked with a <lb/>
frenzy that brought remonstrances from her <lb/>
friends. In addition to her work in the <reg orig="hos-|pital">hospital</reg>, <lb/>
at night she carried on the evangelism in <lb/>
the slums which she had begun at the time of <lb/>
the second mission. She was enabled "to see <lb/>
the image of God, defiled and darkened though <lb/>
it might be, impressed upon every living soul, to <lb/>
feel her kinship with it, to lay her hand, not <lb/>
upon the defilements and impurity, but through <lb/>
the means of her infinite love and tenderness, <lb/>
upon the one spot yet capable of being healed, <lb/>
thus kindling the faintest spark into a living <lb/>
flame." On Christmas 1877 &lpar;her last&rpar; she <reg orig="in-|vited">invited</reg> <lb/>
all her old patients to a dinner which she <lb/>
provided. She worked steadily until June when <lb/>
an outbreak of typhoid in the temporary <reg orig="hos-|pital">hospital</reg> <lb/>
caused its closing, and Sister Dora had an <lb/>
unexpected holiday.</p>
<p>As soon as she was able to leave she visited <lb/>
her nieces in the Isle of Man. From there she <lb/>
went to Paris, and in September was in London <lb/>
studying the treatment of wounds under <reg orig="Pro-|fessor">Professor</reg> <lb/>
Lister. All this time she was bearing <lb/>
alone her own rapidly increasing burden. On <lb/>
October 8 she returned to Walsall where the <lb/>
hospital committee, hearing of her serious <reg orig="ill-|ness">illness</reg>, <lb/>
hired a small house for her. Her <reg orig="condi-|tion">condition</reg> <lb/>
was such that her doctor gave her about a <lb/>
fortnight to live, and on October 10 she wrote <lb/>
to a friend: "It is <hi rend="italic">hopeless</hi> &lpar;I use that word <lb/>
<pb n="158" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0193"/>
merely technically&rpar; so they don't tease me with <lb/>
medicines and remedies, and there is no <reg orig="fluctua-|tion">fluctuation</reg> <lb/>
of hopes and fears. I have not a care; it <lb/>
is all sunshine. God has taken away the fear of <lb/>
death, and all sorrow at parting with life."</p>
<p>On November 4, the new hospital was opened <lb/>
"in the name of Sister Dora," a silver key <reg orig="hav-|ing">having</reg> <lb/>
been sent to her by the committee with the <lb/>
request that she give it to the Mayor and "thus <lb/>
empower him to open the new building <hi rend="italic">in her <lb/>
name</hi>." Where to find her successor had been <lb/>
one of her greatest anxieties, and on December <lb/>
6 it was happily removed. Sister Ellen, a <reg orig="com-|plete">complete</reg> <lb/>
stranger to Sister Dora and to Walsall, <lb/>
offered her services for the hospital. Sister <lb/>
Dora realized that here was the right person, <lb/>
and gave herself up to the relief of being waited <lb/>
on by her. Her release came December 24, 1878. <lb/>
When they could do no more for her she bade <lb/>
them leave her, crying, "I have lived alone; let <lb/>
me die alone." And so she died&mdash;alone save <lb/>
for Him in Whose service she had spent her life <lb/>
&mdash;"not grudgingly or of necessity" but <reg orig="cheer-|fully">cheerfully</reg> <lb/>
and willingly.</p>
<p>Her funeral was attended by all Walsall. By <lb/>
a strange coincidence there were at the same <lb/>
time the funerals of four paupers. Their <lb/>
cort&eacute;ges arrived first and filled the little chapel <lb/>
so that Sister Dora's coffin was left on the porch. <lb/>
The church service was read over the five at <lb/>
once&mdash;as one of the nurses said: "Just as <reg orig="Sis-|ter">Sister</reg> <lb/>
Dora would have wished&mdash;not to be divided, <lb/>
even in death, from the poor people she loved <lb/>
<pb n="159" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0194"/>
so well." The police were useless to keep the <lb/>
people out of the cemetery, but it was a quiet, <lb/>
reverent crowd that stood, every man with his <lb/>
hat off, while the beautiful service at the grave <lb/>
was read. Rich and poor, clergy and laymen, <lb/>
bishops and the lowest of them she had worked <lb/>
to help, all united in paying to her this last <reg orig="lov-|ing">loving</reg> <lb/>
tribute.</p>
<p>Her personality still colors Walsall. Among <lb/>
all the monuments proposed for her the one that <lb/>
the working people most desired was not the <lb/>
home for convalescents that she herself wanted <lb/>
to establish, but a statue of her, so that she <lb/>
would be tangibly present to their children and <lb/>
their children's children. As one humble <reg orig="work-|man">workman</reg> <lb/>
said: "Why, nobody knows better than I <lb/>
do that <hi rend="italic">we</hi> sha'n't forget her&mdash;no danger of <lb/>
that; but <hi rend="italic">I</hi> want her to be there, so that when <lb/>
strangers come to the place and see her <reg orig="stand-|ing">standing</reg> <lb/>
up, they shall ask us, 'Who's that?' and then <lb/>
we shall say, '<hi rend="italic">Who's</hi> that? Why, that's <hi rend="italic">our</hi> <lb/>
Sister Dora.'"</p>
<p>She stands there now, a beautiful statue, yet <lb/>
not simply a thing of cold stone, but rather a <lb/>
vital personality&mdash;<hi rend="italic">their</hi> Sister Dora.</p>

She read how a band of women, inspired <lb/>

prayed in saloons for the victims of drink. She <lb/>
read of the wonderful spread of the movement <lb/>
into the "organized motherhood" of the <lb/>
Women's Christian Temperance Union, as its <lb/>
great president later called it. She was stirred <lb/>
by the narrative and as she herself said "sitting <lb/>
before an English fire in our London house, I <lb/>
joined that crusade." All her later life she had <lb/>
been a student of the Bible and a teacher of its <lb/>
truth. With the coming of this new expression <lb/>
of woman's love for "God and home and native <lb/>
land," she received a new commission to teach, <lb/>
to teach soul culture to thousands of women who <lb/>
should themselves in turn pass on her message. <lb/>
These militant missionaries of personal purity <lb/>
soon saw their message must be preached and <lb/>
taught as an organized body of truth. As the <lb/>
movement grew into an organized propaganda, <lb/>

Mrs. Smith was its chief spiritual counselor. <lb/>
To the moral earnestness of these heroines of a <lb/>
new crusade she gave point and head. Their <lb/>
new evangelism was hers to mold and direct. <lb/>
What was her fitting for this task?</p>
<p>"John M. Whitall was the best loved man in <lb/>
Philadelphia," said one of his friends to his <lb/>
daughter Hannah. And yet John M. Whitall <lb/>
was a Quaker and wore a long gray coat and a <lb/>
broad brimmed hat. Humor, however, had been <lb/>
his from boyhood. Those who knew him as a <lb/>
lad used to say that he was at once the most <lb/>
provoking and the best beloved boy in all their <lb/>
circle. After his father lost most of his money <lb/>
all the boys were left to shift for themselves. <lb/>
John chose the sea, and at sixteen "signed" as <lb/>
the proverbial cabin boy. Good seaman as he <lb/>
soon became, he was a still stauncher Quaker. <lb/>
In 1823, when he was just twenty-three years <lb/>
old, he writes: "While at home from my fifth <lb/>
voyage I believed it right to adopt the plain <lb/>
dress and language of Friends. While under <lb/>
the conviction of its being right, and fearing I <lb/>
should lose my situation if I did so, I met with <lb/>
Samuel Battle, Sr., who, without knowing the <lb/>
distressed state of my mind, told me, if I was <lb/>
faithful to what I felt to be right, the Lord <lb/>
would make a way for me where there seemed <lb/>
no way; which He did, giving me favor in the <lb/>
sight of my employer, much to my comfort. <lb/>
Hearing of a ship as needing a chief mate, I <lb/>
borrowed a plain coat of my friend, James Cox, <lb/>
<pb n="162" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0199"/>
my own not being ready, and called to see the <lb/>
captain, telling him I could not 'Mr.' and 'Sir' <lb/>
him as was common. To which he replied <lb/>
kindly that it would only be a nine day's wonder, <lb/>
and at once engaged me as first mate. Thus <lb/>
my prayer was answered and a way made for <lb/>
me where I saw no way. Praised forever be <lb/>
the name of the Lord." Eight years after he <lb/>
first shipped, he became captain of the largest <lb/>
merchantman sailing out of Philadelphia; five <lb/>
years of profitable voyages enabled him to <lb/>
settle ashore when but thirty. The energy <lb/>
which had driven his merchantmen from coast <lb/>
to coast was equally efficient in the less <reg orig="strenu-|ous">strenuous</reg> <lb/>
adventuring on land. In time his firm <reg orig="be-|came">became</reg> <lb/>
the largest manufacturer of their wares <lb/>
&mdash;clear glass&mdash;in the world. Yet they never <lb/>
made glasses for strong drink of any kind.</p>
<p>With all his earnestness of purpose he had <lb/>
too much humor to be a fanatic. His daughter <lb/>
writes: "I remember well the fun we <reg orig="some-|times">sometimes</reg> <lb/>
had, after we were grown up, over his <reg orig="in-|genious">ingenious</reg> <lb/>
methods of extracting himself from <reg orig="dif-|ficulty">difficulty</reg> <lb/>
when he did not know the first name of <lb/>
any one. He used to substitute for 'Mr.' or <lb/>
'Mrs.' the word 'Cummishilamus,' and would <lb/>
say, for instance, 'Cummishilamus Coleman' <lb/>
said or did so and so. When, however, he had <lb/>
to write the address on a letter, he could not of <lb/>
course use this word and then he would turn to <lb/>
one of us and say, with a merry twinkle of his <lb/>
dear eyes,&mdash;'Come, Han, thee has no scruples, <lb/>
<pb n="163" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0200"/>
so thee may write the 'Mr.' or 'Mrs.' on this <lb/>
letter!"</p>
<p>This staid Philadelphia family lived in an <reg orig="at-|mosphere">atmosphere</reg> <lb/>
of sunshine. The daughter writes: <lb/>
"I remember well how, when my childhood's <lb/>
sky would be all darkened by some heavy <reg orig="child-|ish">childish</reg> <lb/>
affliction, a cheery 'Well, Broadie,' in his <lb/>
hearty voice, or some little passing joke spoken <lb/>
with a roguish twinkle of his loving grey eyes, <lb/>
would clear my sky in a moment, and make life <lb/>
all sunshine again. And, even when I was <lb/>
older, his power to cheer grew no less, and it <lb/>
was quite my habit, whenever I found myself <lb/>
down in the depths, to put myself somewhere <lb/>
in his way, with the certainty that even a <reg orig="mo-|ment's">moment's</reg> <lb/>
peep at his strong cheery face would <lb/>
lift me out. I can even remember that, in his <lb/>
absence, the sight and feel of his dear old <reg orig="over-|coat">overcoat</reg> <lb/>
would somehow brighten everything, and <lb/>
send me off encouraged to be braver and <lb/>
stronger."</p>
<p>The father did more than drive the clouds <lb/>
away; he prevented them from forming. <reg orig="Han-|nah">Hannah</reg> <lb/>
says: "One of the much amused young <lb/>
people of the present day said to me once: 'It <lb/>
seems to me you did not have many amusements <lb/>
when you were young.' 'We did not need to,' <lb/>
was my prompt reply. 'We had my father and <lb/>
my mother and they were all the amusements <lb/>
we needed. They made our lives all sunshine.' <lb/>
I wish I could give to others the vivid picture <lb/>
I have of their inexpressible delightfulness. <lb/>
<pb n="164" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0201"/>
We knew, down to the very bottom of our hearts, <lb/>
that they were on our side against the whole <lb/>
world, and would be our champions in every <lb/>
time of need. No one could oppress us, neither <lb/>
playmates, nor friends, nor enemies, not even <lb/>
our teachers &lpar;those paid oppressors of <reg orig="child-|hood">childhood</reg>, <lb/>
as we felt all teachers to be&rpar;, nor any one <lb/>
the whole world over, without having to reckon <lb/>
with those dear champions at home; and the <lb/>
certain conviction of this, surrounded us with <lb/>
such a panoply of defence, that nothing had <lb/>
power to trouble us overmuch. 'We will tell <lb/>
father,' or 'we will tell mother,' was our <reg orig="un-|failing">unfailing</reg> <lb/>
resource and consolation in every <reg orig="sor-|row">sorrow</reg>. <lb/>
In fact, so sure was I of their <reg orig="champion-|ship">championship</reg>, <lb/>
that when ever any of my friends or school <lb/>
fellows were in trouble, I used to say, 'O well <lb/>
come home with me and let us tell my father <lb/>
and mother;' feeling sure that that dear father <lb/>
and mother could set the whole world straight, <lb/>
if the chance were only given them. And when <lb/>
the answer would come as it often did, 'Oh, that <lb/>
would be of no use, for your father and mother <lb/>
cannot do everything,' I would say, with a <reg orig="pro-|found">profound</reg> <lb/>
pity for their ignorance, 'Ah, you do not <lb/>
know my father and mother.'"</p>
<p>In her girlhood such was Hannah Whitall's <lb/>
conception of fatherhood and motherhood. It <lb/>
was but the shortest step for her theology to <lb/>
clothe her idea of God with the love her <lb/>
earthly father daily typified. As she grew into <lb/>
womanhood and the bloom of her spirit <reg orig="deep-|ened">deepened</reg>, <lb/>
<pb n="165" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0202"/>
it only sweetened her perception of the <lb/>
divine. Her confidence in her father John M. <lb/>
Whitall was no more serene than her <reg orig="confi-|dence">confidence</reg> <lb/>
in her Heavenly Father. She knew that <lb/>
He could set the whole world right, if the <lb/>
chance were only given Him. Whether her <lb/>
message was the little four leaved tract signed <lb/>
"H. W. S." you have seen tucked in your <lb/>
mother's work basket among the stockings <reg orig="wait-|ing">waiting</reg> <lb/>
to be mended, or whether it came to <reg orig="Fran-|ces">Frances</reg> <lb/>
E. Willard and J. Ellen Foster in the <lb/>
Women's Christian Temperance Union, or to <lb/>
Margaret Bright Lucas or Lady Henry <reg orig="Som-|erset">Somerset</reg> <lb/>
in the British Women's Temperance <reg orig="As-|sociation">Association</reg>, <lb/>
it was the same as the message of her <lb/>
girlhood to her girlhood's friends, "Oh, well, <lb/>
never mind; come home with me and let us tell <lb/>
my Father." If the response was not as <reg orig="per-|fect">perfect</reg> <lb/>
as her longing heart might wish, she had <lb/>
the same loving pity in her thought, "Ah, you <lb/>
do not know my Father!" All her life her <lb/>
mission was to discover to others their own <lb/>
souls. And she, mother confessor to <reg orig="woman-|hood&mdash;to">womanhood&mdash;to</reg> <lb/>
the Anglo-Saxon womanhood<ref target="n6" n="6">*</ref>
<note id="n6" place="foot" n="6"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>See <hi rend="italic">Heroines of Modern Progress</hi>, by Elmer C. Adams <lb/>

 that <lb/>
was fighting out a dozen reforms besides <reg orig="tem-|perance&mdash;could">temperance&mdash;could</reg> <lb/>
do this divine thing, for she had <lb/>
taken counsel with her own soul and had <lb/>
searched its depths. The history of her life is <lb/>
a record of that exploration. The material <lb/>
facts of birth and death, of love and marriage, <lb/>
<pb n="166" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0203"/>
of children and home, of private life and <reg orig="pub-|lic">public</reg> <lb/>
career, are but the date lines of this diary <lb/>
of a soul.</p>
<p>This radiant family life&mdash;the family life that <lb/>
made it possible for Hannah Whitall Smith to <lb/>
be the chaplain of the great social movements&mdash; <lb/>
is all the more vividly projected because of its <lb/>
drab Quaker background. Hannah's ancestors <lb/>
had left England for America to seek the <reg orig="free-|dom">freedom</reg> <lb/>
denied them at home. They brought with <lb/>
them a sober earnestness, a repressive creed <lb/>
which fostered introspection. The "perceptible <lb/>
guidance of the Holy Spirit" was their sole rule <lb/>
of conduct. They taught no doctrine or dogma <lb/>
and regarded even the Bible itself inferior in <lb/>
authority to the voice of God speaking in the <lb/>
heart. They thought Sunday school or Bible <lb/>
classes a sort of "creaturely activity" which <lb/>
belonged only to the "world's people." They <lb/>
permitted no prayers; Hannah could not <lb/>
repeat the Lord's Prayer until she was a <lb/>
woman grown. Quakers could not but believe <lb/>
themselves God's own people, set apart for some <lb/>
peculiar work. Their's was in fact a religious <lb/>
aristocracy; this view may have been narrow but <lb/>
it gave a real dignity to life and its duties.</p>
<p>From the Quaker principles of her home, <lb/>
Hannah as a girl once suffered in a peculiarly <lb/>
feminine way. One day her mother came home <lb/>
from meeting and announced to the girls that <lb/>
she felt that the long fringes on certain white <lb/>
china cr&ecirc;pe shawls, the delight of their hearts, <lb/>
were too "gay" for "Friends' children." "I <lb/>
<pb n="167" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0204"/>
can see it all to-day," wrote Hannah when she <lb/>
was seventy years old, "as she carefully spread <lb/>
the shawls out on a large table, and laid a yard <lb/>
stick along the fringe at what she considered <lb/>
was the right length, and proceeded to cut off <lb/>
all the lovely beautiful extra lengths. It was <lb/>
like cutting into our very vitals, and I remember <lb/>
well how we pleaded and pleaded that the fatal <lb/>
yardstick might be slipped down just a little <lb/>
further. Our great fear was that our fringes <lb/>
would be cut shorter than the fringes of similar <lb/>
shawls that had been purchased at the same time <lb/>
for our most intimate friends, Hannah and Jane <lb/>
Scull, who were a little gayer than ourselves. <lb/>
To have their fringes, even so much as the tenth <lb/>
of an inch longer than ours, seemed to us a <lb/>
catastrophe not to be borne."</p>
<p>Another catastrophe was to follow. "The <lb/>
shape of sleeve that was considered plain in my <lb/>
day was what are called leg-of-mutton sleeves, <lb/>
and sleeves of all our dresses were of this <reg orig="ortho-|dox">orthodox</reg> <lb/>
leg-of-mutton shape. But some benign <reg orig="in-|fluence">influence</reg>, <lb/>
what it was we never understood, <reg orig="in-|duced">induced</reg> <lb/>
our mother one spring to let us have our <lb/>
sleeves made a little in the fashion, which <reg orig="hap-|pened">happened</reg> <lb/>
at that time to be what was called bishop <lb/>
sleeves, full at both the shoulder and wrist. <lb/>
The fashion was for very large and full <lb/>
'bishops' and ours were tiny little ones, but <lb/>
they were real 'bishops' and our pride in them <lb/>
was immense. The dresses were our new <lb/>
spring school dresses, of a brown and white <lb/>
striped print, calico we called it. They were <lb/>
<pb n="168" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0205"/>
finished while the weather was still very <reg orig="wintry-|like">wintry-like</reg>, <lb/>
but so great was our desire to show off our <lb/>
fashionable sleeves to the astonished world, <lb/>
that nothing would do but we must put them on <lb/>
and go for a long walk without any coats; and <lb/>
no two prouder little girls were abroad in the <lb/>
whole world that morning than Hannah and <lb/>
Sally Whitall, as they walked along the streets <lb/>
of Philadelphia in their fashionable attire. I <lb/>
remember our younger sister Mary wanted to <lb/>
go with us, but her sleeves were still leg-of-<reg orig="mut-|ton">mutton</reg>, <lb/>
and we felt it would take from the full <lb/>
effect, if one member of our party should <reg orig="dis-|play">display</reg> <lb/>
the despised sleeves, and we made her walk <lb/>
on the opposite side of the way. I can see her <lb/>
longing glances across the street now, as she <lb/>
admired our glory from afar. However, she <lb/>
had her revenge not long after, for ruffled <reg orig="pan-|talets">pantalets</reg> <lb/>
coming down to the feet, had come into <lb/>
fashion, and as our mother was making her a <lb/>
new set, they were made long and ruffled, while <lb/>
we still had to wear our plain hemmed ones, not <lb/>
showing below our dresses. And this time she <lb/>
also went out to walk to show her new panties, <lb/>
but, kinder than we had been, she invited us to <lb/>
accompany her. I am sorry to say, however, <lb/>
that the old Adam in us resented her favored <lb/>
condition so strongly, that we refused to walk <lb/>
on the same side of the street with her, and <lb/>
scornfully crossed over to the other side, <reg orig="leav-|ing">leaving</reg> <lb/>
her to walk alone, with all the glory taken <lb/>
out of her beautiful ruffled pantalets by our <lb/>
cruel scorn and unkindness."</p>
<pb n="169" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0206"/>
<p>No clouds more serious than these darkened <lb/>
the skies of her girlhood. "Truly my life has <lb/>
been one fairy scene of sunshine and of <reg orig="flow-|ers">flowers</reg>," <lb/>
she wrote at sixteen, and later, "There is <lb/>
a continual clapping of hands and shouting of <lb/>
joyful voices in my heart, and every breath feels <lb/>
almost as if it must terminate in a smile of <reg orig="hap-|piness">happiness</reg>. <lb/>
Mother says I laugh too much, but the <lb/>
laugh is in me, and will come out, and I cannot <lb/>
help it."</p>
<p>Back of the laugh in the young girl's heart <lb/>
was an overwhelming desire to be good, <reg orig="some-|how">somehow</reg>, <lb/>
but how she did not know nor care. For <lb/>
years she was content to await the "leadings <lb/>
of the Spirit,"&mdash;guide of all good Quakers. <lb/>
Until she was sixteen she hardly knew that she <lb/>
had a soul, she says; then began her long search <lb/>
after God. In 1848 there came a rush of new <lb/>
thoughts and hopes and wonderings. She <reg orig="re-|alized">realized</reg> <lb/>
the greatness of the universe and began <lb/>
to question the complete absorption and <reg orig="self-|withdrawal">self-withdrawal</reg> <lb/>
of her Quaker faith. Her chief <reg orig="con-|cern">concern</reg> <lb/>
was to win God to her side; she conceived <lb/>
Him as some magnificent but rather selfish <lb/>
power indifferent to her or actually engaged <lb/>
against her. To find out God&mdash;that was the <lb/>
passion which slowly but certainly took <reg orig="posses-|sion">possession</reg> <lb/>
of her life and gripped it for the three <lb/>
score years and more which were to come. <lb/>
From this time onward her diary is one long <lb/>
record of agonized wrestlings. She has no help <lb/>
from friends or even her beloved parents; their <lb/>
Quaker reserve, their respect for the dignity of <lb/>
<pb n="170" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0207"/>
the individual soul, forbade. To her diary she <lb/>
says: "&hellip; far worse than all, I could not feel <lb/>
as if I really loved God. It is dreadful. What <lb/>
shall I do? I must repent, I must love my <lb/>
Heavenly Father, or I shall be eternally ruined. <lb/>
But I cannot do it of myself; God alone can <lb/>
help me, and I know not how to pray. O, what <lb/>
shall I do? Where shall I go? It is said 'Ask <lb/>
and ye shall receive.' But I cannot become <lb/>
really righteous until I repent, and I cannot <lb/>
repent."</p>
<p>Her Quaker education forced her to refer all <lb/>
her longing questions to the "inner light." <lb/>
Patiently she waited. She firmly believed that <lb/>
only when God should reveal Himself to her <lb/>
soul, could she come really to know Him. Her <lb/>
early teaching inevitably turned her mind <reg orig="in-|ward">inward</reg>, <lb/>
upon her own feelings and emotions. <lb/>
What God had said in the Bible seemed of not <lb/>
nearly so much authority as what He might <lb/>
say to her own heart. "I have no recollection <lb/>
of ever for a moment going to the Scriptures for <lb/>
instruction," she says. "The 'inward voice' <lb/>
was to be our sole teacher. And for me at that <lb/>
time the inward voice meant only my own <reg orig="feel-|ings">feelings</reg> <lb/>
and my own emotions. As there is <reg orig="ab-|solutely">absolutely</reg> <lb/>
nothing more unreliable and <reg orig="unmanage-|able">unmanageable</reg> <lb/>
than one's inward feelings, it is no wonder <lb/>
that I was plunged into a hopeless struggle &hellip; <lb/>
I talked about my 'Saviour' as I called Him, <lb/>
but I never for a moment even so much as <lb/>
imagined that He could or would save me unless <lb/>
I could make myself worthy to be saved; and <lb/>
<pb n="171" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0208"/>
as this worthiness was mostly I believed, a <reg orig="mat-|ter">matter</reg> <lb/>
of inward pious emotions, I had no thought <lb/>
but to try somehow to get up these emotions."</p>
<p>Fortunately for the young girl, her natural <lb/>
joyousness delivered her from this morbid state <lb/>
of false religion. Her diary despairingly <reg orig="re-|cords">records</reg>: <lb/>
"So often have I entered into a covenant <lb/>
to serve Him wholly and entirely, with fervour <lb/>
of spirit, but when the impression of my hours <lb/>
of retirement has nearly faded and the <reg orig="tempta-|tions">temptations</reg> <lb/>
of the world have assailed me, I have <lb/>
yielded, and have forgotten my high and holy <lb/>
calling through fear of the world's dread laugh <lb/>
and through the love of sin. O that I could do <lb/>
otherwise! The mercy of God will some day be <lb/>
exhausted, and where will I be then? I dare <lb/>
not think." After writing these tragic words, <lb/>
as if her religious exercises were over, she <lb/>
would go to bed quite happily and sleep the <lb/>
sleep of the just without a moment of wakeful <lb/>
anxiety, and would arise the next morning full <lb/>
of the joys of a new day, forgetting all the <lb/>
miseries recorded the night before.</p>
<p>Thus the daily struggle went on. Until she <lb/>
was married at nineteen she was tossed back <lb/>
and forth between the natural joyousness of her <lb/>
nature and the emotions born of morbid <reg orig="self-|searching">self-searching</reg>. <lb/>
Her marriage with Robert <reg orig="Pear-|sall">Pearsall</reg> <lb/>
Smith and the new and wider interests to <lb/>
which she was introduced turned her attention <lb/>
in other directions and for a time her religious <lb/>
emotions and feelings sank into the background. <lb/>
Hannah Whitall had been happy in her parents; <lb/>
<pb n="172" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0209"/>
she was equally happy in her husband and, <lb/>
later, in their children. The Quaker spirit <lb/>
which respected each soul's individual integrity <lb/>
characterized the new family life as it had the <lb/>
old. Her questionings continued, however, and <lb/>
she still anxiously awaited an emotional <reg orig="bap-|tism">baptism</reg> <lb/>
which in some mysterious way should <reg orig="sup-|ply">supply</reg> <lb/>
her from within with the light which could <lb/>
only come from without. Finally her distress <lb/>
became so great that she gave over her struggle <lb/>
and let loose her grasp on the faith she had. In <lb/>
1855 her diary under the ominous heading "The <lb/>
Eclipse of Faith," records: "I &hellip; have <lb/>
been cognizant of an actual and rapid mental <lb/>
growth. I pass from one phase of experience <lb/>
to another, leave behind me one standing place <lb/>
after another, and am now&mdash;where? Oh, Christ, <lb/>
that I indeed knew where! &hellip; An inevitable <lb/>
chain of reasoning on free will has loosened <lb/>
every foothold, and I know not where to rest, if <lb/>
indeed there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> any rest. Without any <reg orig="appre-|hension">apprehension</reg> <lb/>
on my part of the result, thoughts and <lb/>
reasonings have been slowly gathering around <lb/>
my faith, and dashing themselves against it, <reg orig="un-|til">until</reg> <lb/>
at last, with a sudden shock, it has fallen; and <lb/>
I am lost!" Her reasoning tells her God is <lb/>
neither omnipotent, omniscient, or a God of <reg orig="jus-|tice">justice</reg>. <lb/>
She concludes, "There is no escape! A <lb/>
thousand questions rush in on every side! I <lb/>
am a sceptic!"</p>
<p>After this maze of questioning, however, came <lb/>
relief. At the death of her daughter Nelly, <lb/>
Mrs. Smith's reason saw the little girl's soul <lb/>
<pb n="173" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0210"/>
going out into a universe without God but her <lb/>
motherhood refused to accept the dictum of her <lb/>
skepticism. One day soon after, however, in <lb/>
a prosaic noonday meeting held for business <lb/>
men in the heart of the city her reason caught, <lb/>
as in a flash of insight, the <hi rend="italic">fact</hi> of God. There <lb/>
was no spasm of emotion; the restful conviction <lb/>
came to her that God was a fact and that she <lb/>
must seek to know Him. All her life so far she <lb/>
had been seeking to find herself; she had sought <lb/>
in her heart for those attributes which might <lb/>
lead God to find her. Now she realized that her <lb/>
business was to find out God, to get acquainted <lb/>
with this new Being the fact of whose existence <lb/>
she had just grasped. She says: "It was not <lb/>
that I felt myself to be a sinner needing <reg orig="salva-|tion">salvation</reg>, <lb/>
or that I was troubled about my future <reg orig="des-|tiny">destiny</reg>. <lb/>
It was not a personal question at all. It <lb/>
was simply and only that I had become aware of <lb/>
God, and that I felt I could not rest until I <lb/>
should know Him. I might be good or I might <lb/>
be bad; I might be going to Heaven or I might <lb/>
be going to hell&mdash;these things were outside the <lb/>
question. All I wanted was to become <reg orig="ac-|quainted">acquainted</reg> <lb/>
with the God of whom I had suddenly <lb/>
become aware."</p>
<p>Where should she find Him? Nothing in her <lb/>
life so far had given her any clew to the search. <lb/>
"I concluded that probably the Bible was the <lb/>
book I needed. 'This book,' I said to myself, <lb/>
'professes to teach us about God. &hellip; I will <lb/>
see if it can teach me anything.'" For over <lb/>
fifty years from the day she began this search <lb/>
<pb n="174" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0211"/>
the volume was always with her. At first she <lb/>
was fearful she would soon exhaust the book, <lb/>
it was so small. But as she studied her fear <lb/>
changed to prayer for added days and years in <lb/>
which to study. In finding God she had found <lb/>
herself. Her experience was not a gift or <reg orig="at-|tainment">attainment</reg> <lb/>
or a conversion, even; it was a <reg orig="dis-|covery">discovery</reg>. <lb/>
So great to her was the value of her <lb/>
discovery that she was filled with amazement <lb/>
that she had "lived so long in a world that <reg orig="con-|tained">contained</reg> <lb/>
the Bible and never had found all this <reg orig="be-|fore">before</reg>. <lb/>
Why had nobody ever told me? How <lb/>
could people, who had found it out, have kept <lb/>
such a marvelous piece of good news to <reg orig="them-|selves">themselves</reg>? <lb/>
Certainly I could not keep it to myself, <lb/>
and I determined that no one whom I could <lb/>
reach should be left a day in ignorance, as far <lb/>
as I could help it. I began to buttonhole <reg orig="every-|body">everybody</reg>, <lb/>
pulling them into corners and behind <lb/>
doors to tell them of the wonderful and <reg orig="delight-|ful">delightful</reg> <lb/>
things I had discovered in the Bible about <lb/>
the salvation through the Lord Jesus Christ. <lb/>
It seemed to me the most magnificent piece of <lb/>
good news that any human being had ever had <lb/>
to tell, and I gloried in telling it."</p>
<p>The story of what she found in this <reg orig="wonder-|ful">wonderful</reg> <lb/>
Bible would be a liberal course in theology. <lb/>
Yet it was not a theology so much for those out <lb/>
of Christ entirely as for the great mass of <lb/>
formal Christians who accepted, honestly <lb/>
enough, the theory of salvation, but persistently <lb/>
refused to accept the fact of salvation. Because <lb/>
of her Quaker training she had had no doctrinal <lb/>
<pb n="175" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0212"/>
training, and all that she was learning came in <lb/>
a blaze of illumination. Theological terms <lb/>
were unknown to her; she took the Gospel in a <lb/>
simple common-sense way and taught it as <lb/>
simply.</p>
<p>Hers was a simple faith. It was not so <lb/>
simple, however, as the one she passed on to her <lb/>
little daughter. One day she noticed her little <lb/>
daughter Mary lying on a bridge crossing a <lb/>
brook on their estate, eagerly watching a tin <lb/>
cup she had lowered into the water. She was <lb/>
patiently waiting for the fish to jump in; she <lb/>
had prayed to God for a fish, she explained to <lb/>
her mother, and of course one would jump in as <lb/>
the answer to her petition. After her mother <lb/>
had showed her how to prepare a hook and line <lb/>
and bait, she left the child alone. In a few <lb/>
minutes Mary came running in with her fish, <lb/>
exclaiming to her mother: "Oh, mamma, I see; <lb/>
worms is Heavenly Father's way!"</p>
<p>Heavenly Father's way was the way of the <lb/>
Smith family. Placid but sincere was the life <lb/>
of this household, as it had been of the Whitall <lb/>
home. Mrs. Smith, from one happy year's end <lb/>
to another, studied the Bible. As quickly as she <lb/>
discovered a new phase of this fact of God she <lb/>
felt compelled to pass it on to others. By voice <lb/>
and pen she spread the good news she had <lb/>
found. She and her husband&mdash;for he had come <lb/>
with her into the same fresh inspiration&mdash; <lb/>
carried their joint work into England where <lb/>
it soon came to be as much a part of English <lb/>
religious life as it was of American. Wherever <lb/>
<pb n="176" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0213"/>
the English language was read, her books and <lb/>
tracts found their way. Everywhere the result <lb/>
was the same; she brought Christians to the <lb/>
deeper possibilities of the Christian life. Early <lb/>
in the organization of the Woman's Christian <lb/>
Temperance Union, she began to teach those <lb/>
women, women who were themselves teaching a <lb/>
world to be pure. Later she performed the <lb/>
same service for the members of the English <lb/>
branch of the international organization.<ref target="n7" n="7">*</ref>

Union, see the biography of Frances Willard, page 215, and of <lb/>
J. Ellen Foster, page 245, <hi rend="italic">Heroines of Modern Progress.</hi></p></note>
 In <lb/>
the National Woman's Christian Temperance <lb/>
Union she for a time was Superintendent of the <lb/>
Evangelical Department but whether in official <lb/>
capacity or not she was always preparing Bible <lb/>
studies and readings&mdash;Scripture lessons that <lb/>
strengthened and deepened the religious <reg orig="back-|ground">background</reg> <lb/>
of that great crusade. While her tracts <lb/>
were going by the hundreds of thousands to <reg orig="en-|courage">encourage</reg> <lb/>
the rank and file of the white-ribbon <lb/>
army, her home was the sanctuary to which the <lb/>
generals came for spiritual rest, where they <reg orig="re-|created">recreated</reg> <lb/>
the spiritual exaltation without which <lb/>
they could not have given point nor head to the <lb/>
on-sweeping movement.</p>
<p>Thus Hannah Whitall Smith became the high <lb/>
priestess of Anglo-Saxon womanhood, <reg orig="organ-|ized">organized</reg> <lb/>
and embattled as it never had been before. <lb/>
She became the high priestess solely because <lb/>
she had found her own soul, and, through finding <lb/>
it, had found the fact of God. The story of her <lb/>
<pb n="177" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0214"/>
life is the record of her state of mind; had that <lb/>
record been different, the record of the <reg orig="world-|wide">worldwide</reg> <lb/>
woman's campaign for social purity and <lb/>
justice would not be what it is.</p>
<p>Mrs. Smith's later years were filled with <reg orig="in-|validism">invalidism</reg>. <lb/>
She was finally confined to her room <lb/>
and at last to her chair. Her last written <reg orig="mes-|sage">message</reg>, <lb/>
a card sent broadcast to her friends, is <lb/>
as sunny as the course of her life: "I felt a <lb/>
great desire, during the season of Christmas <lb/>
and New Year's greetings to send one myself <lb/>
to all the friends whom I love so much, but <lb/>
owing to my difficulty in writing, it seemed <reg orig="im-|possible">impossible</reg>. <lb/>
In one of my wakeful hours at night, <lb/>
however, on the first day of the New Year, it <lb/>
suddenly came to me that I might send a <reg orig="cir-|cular">circular</reg> <lb/>
greeting for 1911 to all of you which would <lb/>
embody the substance of what I would love to <lb/>
say to each one individually, had I but the <lb/>
strength to do so.</p>
<p>"&hellip; I am living with my son and my two <lb/>
grand-daughters in a beautiful home on the <lb/>
banks of the Thames, not far from Oxford. <lb/>
&hellip; I could not ask for a lovelier refuge in <lb/>
which to pass the last years of my life, nor for <lb/>
better company. &hellip; My old activities have all <lb/>
had to be laid aside, and I am only waiting and <lb/>
longing for the blessed call to my heavenly <lb/>
home. But I am glad to tell you that I am very <lb/>
happy and contented in my narrowed life, and <lb/>
with my lessening capabilities, and can say, <lb/>
'Thy will be done' to my divine Master from <lb/>
the very bottom of my heart."</p>
<pb n="178" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0215"/>
<p>So she died, April 30, 1911, saying to her <lb/>
divine Master, "Thy will be done." And this <lb/>
is what she says of that divine Master: "I had <lb/>
found that God, just alone, without anything <lb/>
else, was enough. Even the comfort of His <lb/>
promises paled before the comfort of Himself. <lb/>
What difference did it make if I could not find <lb/>
a promise to fit my case? I had found the <lb/>
Promiser, and He was infinitely more than all <lb/>
His promises.</p>
<p>"I remember well how, when I was a child <lb/>
and found myself in any trouble or perplexity, <lb/>
the coming in of my father or mother upon the <lb/>
scene would always bring me immediate relief. <lb/>
The moment I heard the voice of one of them <lb/>
calling my name, that very moment every <reg orig="bur-|den">burden</reg> <lb/>
dropped off and every fear vanished. I had <lb/>
got my father or my mother, and what more <lb/>
could I need? It was their simple presence that <lb/>
did it. They did not need to stand up and make <lb/>
a string of promises for my relief, nor detail to <lb/>
me the plans of deliverance. The mere fact <lb/>
of their presence was all the assurance I <reg orig="re-|quired">required</reg> <lb/>
that everything now would be all right, <lb/>
for me&mdash;must in fact, be all right, because they <lb/>
were my parents and I was their child. And <lb/>
how much more true must all this be in regard <lb/>
to our Heavenly Father, who has all wisdom <lb/>
and all power, and whose very name is the God <lb/>
of Love."</p>

FRANCES RIDLEY HAVERGAL</hi></head>
<byline><hi rend="small-caps">by woodman bradbury</hi></byline>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> songs of a nation are as important as <lb/>
its laws; and the hymns of the church have <lb/>
had as great influence on its life and doctrine <lb/>
as the decrees of councils or the systems of <lb/>
theologians.</p>
<p>For nearly two generations, Christian <lb/>
people have been singing: <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>Take my life and let it be</l>
<l>Consecrated, Lord, to Thee.</l>
</lg></q>
Can any one measure the influence of this one <lb/>
hymn upon the lives of those who have loved it <lb/>
and sung it?</p>
<p>Its origin is interestingly significant. Miss <lb/>
Havergal, the author, was invited to a house <lb/>
party of five days in London. There were ten <lb/>
in the party, some unconverted to Christ, and <lb/>
some of the Christians "not rejoicing." Now, <lb/>
personal joy in the Lord, the bubbling of an <lb/>
ever-flowing fountain of peace, was to Miss <lb/>
Havergal so constant and precious an <reg orig="experi-|ence">experience</reg> <lb/>
that she wished all to share it. <reg orig="Accord-|ingly">Accordingly</reg>, <lb/>
her heart went out toward them all; and <lb/>
<pb n="180" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0217"/>
she prayed, "Lord, give me all in this house." <lb/>
She adds, "And He just <hi rend="italic">did.</hi> Before I left the <lb/>
house, every one had got a blessing." They <lb/>
had all come to Jesus and believed His <reg orig="prom-|ises">promises</reg>; <lb/>
"and so coming, so believing, they found <lb/>
rest unto their souls. They found, too, that His <lb/>
word was true and that His taking away our <lb/>
sins was a reality." That night, she was too <lb/>
happy to sleep. A deep joy possessed her. "I <lb/>
passed most of the night in renewal of my <reg orig="con-|secration">consecration</reg>; <lb/>
and these little couplets formed <reg orig="them-|selves">themselves</reg> <lb/>
and chimed in my heart one after the <lb/>
other till they finished with 'ever, only, <hi rend="italic">all</hi> for <lb/>
Thee.'" Surely that which is born in such an <lb/>
experience is endowed with vitality and <reg orig="pre-|destined">predestined</reg> <lb/>
of God for real accomplishment.</p>
<p>Frances Ridley Havergal was born at Astley, <lb/>
Worcestershire, England, December 14, 1836, <lb/>
and died at Caswell Bay, Swansea, South Wales, <lb/>
June 3, 1879, in the forty-third year of her life. <lb/>
She was a bright and winsome child, precocious <lb/>
in affection as well as in intellect. At the age <lb/>
of seven she wrote verses. Soon after, she <reg orig="be-|came">became</reg> <lb/>
a linguist; she acquired mastery of <lb/>
French, German and Italian and of Latin, <lb/>
Greek and Hebrew&mdash;of the last two that she <lb/>
might better understand the Bible. To the <lb/>
study of the Scriptures all her powers of <reg orig="schol-|arship">scholarship</reg> <lb/>
and intuition were bent, as a look into her <lb/>
annotated and underlined Bible would show and <lb/>
as a study of her hymns would abundantly <reg orig="tes-|tify">testify</reg>. <lb/>
During her visits to Wales, she learned <lb/>
<pb entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0218"/>
<figure id="f8" rend="page" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0218">
<head>FRANCES RIDLEY HAVERGAL.</head>
</figure>
<pb entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0219"/>
<pb n="181" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0220"/>
enough Welsh to enable her to take part in <reg orig="wor-|ship">worship</reg>.</p>
<p>Her conversion was thorough and, as is <reg orig="gen-|erally">generally</reg> <lb/>
the case, profoundly influenced her <reg orig="the-|ology">theology</reg>. <lb/>
As a child she felt herself a sinner, and <lb/>
this feeling was intensified at her mother's <lb/>
death, which occurred when Frances was only <lb/>
eleven years old. At fourteen, Diana, her <lb/>
room-mate at school, "found peace," and cried <lb/>
out to her friend: "Oh, Fanny, dearest Fanny, <lb/>
the blessing has come to me at last. Jesus has <lb/>
forgiven me, I know. He is my Saviour and I <lb/>
am so happy. He is such a Saviour as I never <lb/>
imagined, so good, so loving. Only come to <lb/>
Him and He will receive you." Thus <reg orig="encour-|aged">encouraged</reg> <lb/>
and exhorted, Frances assiduously sought <lb/>
the Saviour till she finally could "trust," and <lb/>
that surrender brought assurance that her sins <lb/>
were forgiven. In successive stages <reg orig="through-|out">throughout</reg> <lb/>
her life this assurance deepened.</p>
<p>Later, when she was sent away to a boarding <lb/>
school in Germany, she was surrounded by a <lb/>
hundred and ten girls who shared neither her <lb/>
experience nor her aspirations. Her personal <lb/>
religion was too vital a thing for them to <reg orig="under-|stand">understand</reg>. <lb/>
A lesser nature might have succumbed, <lb/>
but she found that nipping atmosphere "very <lb/>
bracing" to her Christian life. She wrote <lb/>
home, "I must walk worthy of my calling."</p>
<p>The formal seal upon this "calling" occurred <lb/>
after her return to England, when she was <lb/>
seventeen years old. Of her experience as she <lb/>
<pb n="182" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0221"/>
stood before the altar at Worcester Cathedral <lb/>
she writes: "My feelings when his &lsqb;the <lb/>
bishop's&rsqb; hands were placed on my head I can <lb/>
not describe. When the words, 'Defend, O <lb/>
Lord, this Thy child with Thy heavenly grace, <lb/>
that she may continue thine forever, and daily <lb/>
increase in Thy Holy Spirit more and more, <lb/>
until she come into Thy everlasting Kingdom' <lb/>
were solemnly pronounced, if ever my heart <reg orig="fol-|lowed">followed</reg> <lb/>
a prayer it did then, if ever it thrilled with <lb/>
earnest longing not unmixed with joy, it did at <lb/>
the words, 'Thine forever.'"</p>
<p>This deep, sacred experience found <reg orig="expres-|sion">expression</reg> <lb/>
in a stanza of self-dedication, written on <lb/>
the day of her confirmation, July 17, 1854: <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<head>THINE FOREVER</head>
<l>Oh! "Thine for ever," what a blessed thing</l>
<l rend="indent">To be forever His who died for me!</l>
<l>My Saviour, all my life Thy praise I'll sing,</l>
<l rend="indent">Nor cease my song throughout eternity.</l>
</lg></q>
She always kept the anniversary of her <reg orig="con-|firmation">confirmation</reg> <lb/>
as a day of retirement and prayer; <lb/>
often she then renewed her pledges in verse as <lb/>
the following stanza, written but two years <reg orig="be-|fore">before</reg> <lb/>
her death shows: <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>Only for Jesus! Lord, keep it for ever,</l>
<l rend="indent">Sealed on the heart and engraved on the life!</l>
<l>Pulse of all gladness, and nerve of endeavor,</l>
<l rend="indent">Secret of rest, and the strength of our strife!</l>
</lg></q></p>
<pb n="183" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0222"/>
<p>The vows solemnly taken in youth thereafter <lb/>
ruled her life. She lived for her Saviour. Her <lb/>
friends and acquaintances could not but feel her <lb/>
complete consecration. A teacher wrote of her: <lb/>
"What imprinted the stamp of nobility upon <lb/>
her whole being and influenced all her opinions <lb/>
was her true piety, and the deep reverence she <lb/>
had for her Lord and Saviour whose <reg orig="exam-|ple">example</reg> <lb/>
penetrated her young life through and <lb/>
through."</p>
<p>This piety of hers, however, had nothing dark <lb/>
and dismal about it. Upon a visit to Ireland <lb/>
when she was but twenty years old, Miss <reg orig="Hav-|ergal">Havergal</reg> <lb/>
left this impression upon an Irish school <lb/>
girl: "Five o'clock <hi rend="small-caps">p.m.</hi> was the hour <reg orig="ap-|pointed">appointed</reg> <lb/>
for the girls to arrive at the Lodge. <lb/>
We were in a great state of delight at the <lb/>
thought of seeing 'the little English lady.' In a <lb/>
few seconds Miss Frances, caroling like a bird, <lb/>
flashed into the room. Flashed! Yes, I say <lb/>
the word advisedly, flashed in like a burst of <lb/>
sunshine, like a hillside breeze, and stood before <lb/>
us, her fair sunny curls falling around her <lb/>
shoulders, her bright eyes dancing, and her <lb/>
fresh sweet voice ringing through the room. I <lb/>
shall never forget that afternoon, never! I sat <lb/>
perfectly spellbound as she sang chant and <lb/>
hymn with marvelous sweetness, and then <lb/>
played two or three pieces of Handel which <lb/>
thrilled me through and through. She finished <lb/>
with singing her father's tune &lpar;Hobah&rpar; to 'The <lb/>
Church of our Fathers.' She shook hands with <lb/>
<pb n="184" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0223"/>
each, and said with a merry laugh: 'The next <lb/>
time I come to Ireland, we must get up a little <lb/>
singing class and you must all sing with me.' <lb/>
As we walked home, one and another said: 'O, <lb/>
isn't she lovely? and doesn't she sing like a born <lb/>
angel!' 'I love her, I do; and I'd follow her <lb/>
every step of the way back to England if I <lb/>
could!'"</p>
<p>Looking through the eyes of this enthusiastic <lb/>
Irish girl, is it hard to guess why throughout her <lb/>
life Miss Havergal radiated Christian <reg orig="hap-|piness">happiness</reg>? <lb/>
She was indeed an accomplished <reg orig="mu-|sician">musician</reg>; <lb/>
she played the pianoforte with skill, sang <lb/>
with charm, and composed. Her friends <reg orig="de-|lighted">delighted</reg> <lb/>
to hear her interpret the great masters, <lb/>
especially Handel, Beethoven and Mendelssohn, <lb/>
much of whose work she knew by heart. Her <lb/>
playing of Beethoven's <hi rend="italic">Moonlight Sonata</hi> was <lb/>
unforgettable. Even the great Hiller said she <lb/>
had decided talent.</p>
<p>This musical taste and ability she inherited <lb/>
from her father, the Reverend William Henry <lb/>
Havergal, M. A., a devout rector. He composed <lb/>
cathedral services and many hundred chants <lb/>
and tunes, and several sacred songs, the profits <lb/>
of which were always devoted to various forms <lb/>
of benevolence and missions, and the repair of <lb/>
churches. A cathedral service in A won him a <lb/>
prize medal and a second gold medal came for <lb/>
his anthem, <hi rend="italic">Give Thanks</hi>. His home life with <lb/>
his six children, of whom Frances was the <lb/>
youngest, was ideal. Frances, like her father, <lb/>
delighted in making religious use of her musical <lb/>
<pb n="185" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0224"/>
talent. "Literal singing for Jesus is to me, <lb/>
somehow, the most personal and direct <reg orig="commis-|sion">commission</reg> <lb/>
I hold from my beloved Master. Every <lb/>
line in my little poem, 'Singing for Jesus,' is <lb/>
from personal experience."</p>
<p>She became increasingly interested in the <lb/>
great cause of temperance, in which there was <lb/>
then an even greater need than to-day for <reg orig="ear-|nest">earnest</reg> <lb/>
work. Hospital visitation, foreign <reg orig="mis-|sions">missions</reg>, <lb/>
Sunday school work for boys, and gospel <lb/>
work among sailors enlisted her co&ouml;peration <lb/>
and in these practical ways her religion found <lb/>
expression. She was greatly interested in the <lb/>
religious possibilities of the Young Women's <lb/>
Christian Association, and was a zealous <lb/>
worker in it. It is little wonder that a life <lb/>
of such devoutness should be marked by trust, <lb/>
praise, and spiritual insight. "A <reg orig="disappoint-|ment">disappointment</reg>," <lb/>
she said, "is His appointment." <lb/>
"'Thy will be done' is not a sigh but a song." <lb/>
Later in life, she wrote to a friend: "I have <lb/>
been so happy lately, and the words 'Thou hast <lb/>
put gladness in my heart' I can use, as true of <lb/>
my own case."</p>
<p>Her happiness was not dimmed by the fact <lb/>
that her health was never robust and ailments <lb/>
came with increasing frequency. Her last <reg orig="ill-|ness">illness</reg> <lb/>
was brought on by an exertion <reg orig="character-|istic">characteristic</reg> <lb/>
of her whole life. She had promised to <lb/>
meet some men and boys on the river bank; <lb/>
and though the day proved to be very damp, she <lb/>
went with her Bible and temperance book, held <lb/>
the meeting, and returned wet and chilly with <lb/>
<pb n="186" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0225"/>
the rain and sea-mist. Though feeling poorly, <lb/>
she insisted on going to communion the <reg orig="fol-|lowing">following</reg> <lb/>
day, and rode back on a donkey, <reg orig="at-|tended">attended</reg> <lb/>
by quite a procession of people. Her <lb/>
donkey boy recalls that Miss Frances told him, <lb/>
"I had better leave the devil's side and get on <lb/>
the safe side; that Jesus Christ's was the <reg orig="win-|ning">winning</reg> <lb/>
side; that He loved us and was calling us, <lb/>
and wouldn't I choose Him for my Captain?" <lb/>
Arriving at home, Miss Havergal ran in for <lb/>
her book and the boy signed the pledge on the <lb/>
saddle. A young sailor, also, W. Llewellyn by <lb/>
name, seemed interested. He was going to sea <lb/>
the next day. Miss Havergal dragged herself <lb/>
to the cottage to speak with him. He signed <lb/>
the pledge and his last letter, written from <lb/>
Brazil, states that he has faithfully kept it. <lb/>
This was the last time Miss Havergal's feet <lb/>
were <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>Swift and beautiful for Thee.</l>
</lg></q>
These exertions caused her to take to her bed.</p>
<p>Her illness took a sudden turn for the worse. <lb/>
She seemed to divine what the end would be. <lb/>
When suffering the most, she whispered, "It's <lb/>
home the faster." Later, she said to her <reg orig="sis-|ter">sister</reg>, <lb/>
"God's will is delicious; He makes no <reg orig="mis-|takes">mistakes</reg>."</p>
<p>The vicar of Swansea hurried to her bedside. <lb/>
"Is Jesus with you now?" he asked. "Of <lb/>
course he is!" was the reply; "it is splendid! <lb/>
I thought He would have left me here a long <lb/>
while; but He is <hi rend="italic">so</hi> good to take me now. Tell <lb/>
<pb n="187" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0226"/>
<gap desc="long dash" reason="missing" id="g1"/> that God's promises are all true, and the <lb/>
Lord Jesus is a good big foundation to rest <lb/>
upon. Ask Mr. A<gap desc="long dash" reason="missing" id="g2"/> to speak <hi rend="italic">plainly</hi> about <lb/>
Jesus; I want all young ministers to be <reg orig="faith-|ful">faithful</reg> <lb/>
ambassadors, and win souls. &hellip; Oh, I <lb/>
want all of you to speak <hi rend="italic">bright,</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">bright</hi> words <lb/>
about Jesus, oh, do, <hi rend="italic">do!</hi> It is all perfect peace. <lb/>
I am only waiting for Jesus to take me in." <lb/>
A sharp spasm ensued, after which she sank <lb/>
back, folded her hands on her breast and said: <lb/>
"There, now it's all over. Blessed rest!" <lb/>
Those who looked on in awe said that her death <lb/>
was almost a visible meeting with her King. <lb/>
Her countenance lighted up as if she were <reg orig="al-|ready">already</reg> <lb/>
talking to Him, a glorious radiance on <lb/>
her face. Then, as her brother was praying, <lb/>
her spirit fled away.</p>
<p>In forming an estimate of the value of Miss <lb/>
Havergal's life for posterity, first place must <lb/>
be given to her hymns. It is by these that <lb/>
she, "though dead, yet speaketh." Fifty of <lb/>
them are now found in common use in <reg orig="English-|speaking">English-speaking</reg> <lb/>
countries. One will readily recall <lb/>
familiar lines, such as "I gave my life for <lb/>
thee," "Lord, speak to me that I may speak," <lb/>
"Tell it out among the heathen," "O Saviour, <lb/>
precious Saviour," "True-hearted, <reg orig="whole-|hearted">wholehearted</reg>." <lb/>
Still other hymns have won <reg orig="immor-|tality">immortality</reg>, <lb/>
such as "Our yet unfinished story," "I <lb/>
could not do without Thee," "I am trusting <lb/>
Thee, Lord Jesus," "Thou art coming, O my <lb/>
Saviour." If this list seems large it is an <reg orig="evi-|dence">evidence</reg> <lb/>
of the magnitude of her life-task. If, on <lb/>
<pb n="188" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0227"/>
the contrary, it seems incomplete, and lovers of <lb/>
her work wonder at the omission of their <lb/>
favorites from the list, this fact too, is <reg orig="evi-|dence">evidence</reg> <lb/>
of the quality and permanence of her <lb/>
contribution to hymnology.</p>
<p>These hymns first saw the light in a very <lb/>
humble way. Intimate friends urged their <lb/>
publication, and they were printed as leaflets <lb/>
or ornamental cards. Their success was <reg orig="im-|mediate">immediate</reg> <lb/>
and they were scattered by the tens of <lb/>
thousands. With their message of gospel <lb/>
cheer, they reached humble homes in all parts <lb/>
of the world; afterwards they were gathered <lb/>
into inexpensive booklets. It was not till <lb/>
1869 that a collection of her poems was <reg orig="pub-|lished">published</reg> <lb/>
under the title <hi rend="italic">The Ministry of Song. <lb/>
Under the Surface</hi> followed in 1874, <hi rend="italic">Life <reg orig="Mo-|saics">Mosaics</reg></hi> <lb/>
in 1879; and other volumes appeared <reg orig="post-|humously">posthumously</reg>, <lb/>
through the devotion of a sister.</p>
<p>The origin of "I gave my life for thee" <lb/>
shows the spontaneity of all her work. Miss <lb/>
Havergal was visiting in Germany in 1858; and <lb/>
coming in weary, one afternoon, her eye rested <lb/>
on an <hi rend="italic">Ecce Homo</hi>. It was such a picture of <lb/>
the suffering Saviour as touched the heart of <lb/>
Count Zinzendorf in 1719 and made a <reg orig="mission-|ary">missionary</reg> <lb/>
of him. Whether the experience of the <lb/>
great Moravian was in Miss Havergal's mind <lb/>
or not, the motto beneath the picture, <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italic">"Hoc <lb/>
feci pro te; quid facis pro me?"</hi></foreign> touched her <lb/>
emotions, and she rapidly wrote the hymn upon <lb/>
a bit of paper. But it seemed poor to her, and <lb/>
she started to throw it into the open fire. <lb/>
<pb n="189" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0228"/>
Something restrained her, however, and she put <lb/>
it, crumpled and singed, into her pocket. Soon <lb/>
after, she read it to an old saint in an <reg orig="alms-|house">almshouse</reg> <lb/>
who was much helped by it. She was <reg orig="en-|couraged">encouraged</reg> <lb/>
to print it, and it met with wide favor. <lb/>
Her father composed a tune for it, <hi rend="italic">Baca</hi>, <lb/>
and it was widely sung. The tune by P. P. <lb/>
Bliss is generally used in the United States, <lb/>
although many musicians have composed for <lb/>
it; but it remained for Barnby's genius to wed <lb/>
the hymn to perfect music, in his <hi rend="italic">St. Olave</hi>. <lb/>
It was the hearing of three of her hymns sung <lb/>
at church, among them <hi rend="italic">Baca</hi>, which led Miss <lb/>
Havergal to note the wide influence of religious <lb/>
music and to resolve to concentrate her energies <lb/>
upon its production for her Master.</p>
<p>"Tell it out among the heathen that the Lord <lb/>
is King" followed much later in her career. <lb/>
It was born on a snowy Sunday morning in <lb/>
1872 when Miss Havergal's ill health debarred <lb/>
her from going to church. Her friends, on <reg orig="re-|turning">returning</reg> <lb/>
from service, were surprised to find <lb/>
her at the piano, a new hymn already written <lb/>
in her hand. In explanation, she said that she <lb/>
was following the church service in her room <lb/>
when a sentence from the prayer book struck <lb/>
her attention. "What a splendid first line!" <lb/>
she thought, and so the hymn came. It was <lb/>
popularized by Mr. Sankey in a tune of his own <lb/>
composition.</p>
<p>Miss Havergal always felt that her poems <lb/>
were "given" to her from above. "Writing <lb/>
is <hi rend="italic">praying</hi> with me, for I never seem to write <lb/>
<pb n="190" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0229"/>
even a verse by myself and feel like a little child <lb/>
writing what is dictated." In 1874, she wrote <lb/>
to a friend: "The Master has not put a chest <lb/>
of poetic gold into my possession and said, <lb/>
'Now use it as you like!' but He keeps the gold <lb/>
and gives it to me piece by piece just when He <lb/>
will and as much as He will and no more."</p>
<p>More of her theory of hymn writing she <lb/>
gives in the introduction to her book <hi rend="italic"><reg orig="Speci-|men-Glasses">Specimen-Glasses</reg></hi>. <lb/>
She calls them "flowers," and <lb/>
continues: "Far-wafted fragrance, exquisite <lb/>
workmanship, delicate and striking beauty of <lb/>
form and color, stores of hidden honey, are <lb/>
not the only points of comparison. There <lb/>
should be in every such flower incorruptible <lb/>
seed, which may spring up in the heart of many <lb/>
a gatherer, blossoming there in the beauty of <lb/>
holiness, and bearing fruit unto life eternal. <lb/>
&hellip; Some hymns are true amaranths, and <lb/>
never die, rather gaining than losing the power <lb/>
of their fragrance and loveliness as years and <lb/>
even centuries pass on."</p>
<p>Later on, in this same book, she writes an <lb/>
illuminating comment on the hymns of <reg orig="Char-|lotte">Charlotte</reg> <lb/>
Elliott which not only is inherently true <lb/>
but also applies perfectly to Miss Havergal <lb/>
herself. "Her hymns are all heart-work, and <lb/>
whether written in first, second or third <reg orig="per-|son">person</reg>, <lb/>
we feel that she has lived every line; and <lb/>
that is why they touch other lives so <reg orig="magnet-|ically">magnetically</reg>. <lb/>
&hellip; It may take many a year of living <lb/>
to produce a hymn which comes to the surface <lb/>
in a flash of thought."</p>
<pb n="191" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0230"/>
<p>Work of this quality naturally is attractive <lb/>
to the musicians of the highest skill; and Miss <lb/>
Havergal's verse has been set to music by some <lb/>
of the best composers of the nineteenth century. <lb/>
Among them can be mentioned Gounod, <reg orig="Blumen-|thal">Blumenthal</reg>, <lb/>
Randegger, Pinsuti, Dykes and Abt.</p>
<p>With her poetic gift went also, as a most <lb/>
fitting companion, an unusual appreciation of <lb/>
music. As a little girl she noted that the <lb/>
cuckoo's song which was a major third in May <lb/>
became a minor third in June. "Music," she <lb/>
wrote, "seems the only universal language <reg orig="un-|derstood">understood</reg> <lb/>
by men of every age and tongue, and <lb/>
by the angels too. It is an alphabet of the <reg orig="lan-|guage">language</reg> <lb/>
of heaven, though not any more equal <lb/>
to it than an A B C book is to Milton." Again: <lb/>
"On no form of the beautiful is 'passing away' <lb/>
so engraven as on music. In 'passing away' <lb/>
lies its very essence. The most exquisite <reg orig="pas-|sage">passage</reg>, <lb/>
if lingered on, loses its very existence as <lb/>
well as beauty; the time, the motion, is the life, <lb/>
the actual notes only a dead letter without it; <lb/>
while to <hi rend="italic">hold</hi> it is simply an inherent <reg orig="impos-|sibility">impossibility</reg>." <lb/>
This is philosophic criticism of rare <lb/>
order. She was equally sensitive to the <lb/>
esthetic and spiritual side of music. "To me <lb/>
the overture to the &lsqb;Mendelssohn&rsqb; <foreign lang="ger"><hi rend="italic">Lobgesang</hi></foreign> <lb/>
is a vision of Christian life, with its own <lb/>
peculiar struggles and sorrows as well as joys. <lb/>
It is the sixth, seventh and eighth chapter of <lb/>
Romans in essence. The mingling of twilight <lb/>
yearnings, ever pressing <hi rend="italic">onward</hi>, with calm and <lb/>
trustful praise, ever pressing <hi rend="italic">upward</hi>, is an <lb/>
<pb n="192" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0231"/>
almost unbearably true echo of the heart; the <lb/>
<foreign lang="spa"><hi rend="italic">andante religioso</hi></foreign> is the still, mellow glow of <lb/>
light at eventide, to which one looks forward; <lb/>
then I go just one step farther and find a <reg orig="fore-|echo">fore-echo</reg> <lb/>
of the eternal song in the burst of vocal <lb/>
praise, after the long tension of the voiceless <lb/>
overture."</p>
<p>Miss Havergal's hymns echo her theology; <lb/>
it was warmly evangelical and deeply <reg orig="subjec-|tive">subjective</reg>. <lb/>
If it were to be criticised at all, it would <lb/>
be for its lack of the social emphasis now so <lb/>
common in Christian thinking. Moreover, to <lb/>
one whose experience has not been so deep as <lb/>
hers, she seems over-intense. The writer <reg orig="re-|members">remembers</reg> <lb/>
the repugnance he felt as a boy to <lb/>
some of the sentiments he found in <hi rend="italic">Kept for <lb/>
the Master's Use.</hi> He had a feeling that a <lb/>
college song was all right on occasion and <reg orig="re-|volted">revolted</reg> <lb/>
against the pietism which would "sing" <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>Always, only, for my King.</l>
</lg></q>
It seemed an undue renunciation of innocent <lb/>
pleasures, a false demarcation between the <lb/>
world and the church, the secular and the <reg orig="Chris-|tian">Christian</reg>. <lb/>
This fact is noted here simply for the <lb/>
enlightenment of those who may have felt the <lb/>
same way, as if Miss Havergal were <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>A creature quite too bright and good</l>
<l>For human nature's daily food,</l>
</lg></q>
to alter Wordsworth for this purpose!</p>
<p>This feeling, however, does an injustice to <lb/>
<pb n="193" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0232"/>
Miss Havergal. There was no cant about her. <lb/>
There was absolutely none of the holier-<reg orig="than-|thou">than-thou</reg> <lb/>
in her relations with others. She was <lb/>
simple, unaffected, genuine, true. She lived <lb/>
higher up on the mountain-side of Christian <reg orig="ex-|perience">experience</reg> <lb/>
than most mortals; but she beckoned <lb/>
to all who dwelt below and bore consistent <reg orig="wit-|ness">witness</reg> <lb/>
to the quality of life up there.</p>
<p>Her life has been seized upon by ardent <reg orig="sec-|tarians">sectarians</reg> <lb/>
of different schools to illustrate their <lb/>
pet theories of "sinless perfection," of "<reg orig="sec-|ond">second</reg> <lb/>
blessing," and the like; but her experience <lb/>
was far too large and genuine to fit into any <lb/>
molds so narrow and irregular. Her career <lb/>
illustrated not a second blessing but a score <lb/>
of blessings; it was a running commentary on <lb/>
the text: "Grow in grace and in the <reg orig="knowl-|edge">knowledge</reg> <lb/>
of Jesus." "You know something of how <lb/>
He can 'come,'" she once wrote, "but do you <lb/>
think you have reached the end of His gracious <lb/>
comings?" She was a little suspicious of a <lb/>
too-easy consecration. "There is always a <reg orig="dan-|ger">danger</reg> <lb/>
that just because we say 'all' we practically <lb/>
fall shorter than if we said 'some' but said it <lb/>
very definitely."</p>
<p>Sanity, reasonableness, a sunny, human <reg orig="tem-|per">temper</reg>, <lb/>
a sense of humor, marked her work as well <lb/>
as her life and kept her from flying off on any <lb/>
tangent. Greater than her music, greater than <lb/>
her hymns was the person herself. Her <reg orig="re-|ligious">religious</reg> <lb/>
life was pure, deep, constant. She fed <lb/>
upon her Bible. All her work is pervaded by <lb/>
its teachings. In one poem of sixty-four lines, <lb/>
<pb n="194" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0233"/>
the writer has counted one hundred and eleven <lb/>
references to the Christian Scriptures! One <lb/>
is not surprised, therefore, at her spiritual <reg orig="de-|velopment">development</reg>. <lb/>
To her nearest and dearest she was <lb/>
the embodiment of her own words: <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>The fullness of His blessing encompasseth our way;</l>
<l rend="hang">The fullness of His promises crowns every brightening <lb/>
day;</l>
<l>The fullness of His glory is beaming from above,</l>
<l rend="hang">While more and more we realize the fullness of His <lb/>
love.</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>Thus, through devotional poetry and music, <lb/>
her intense life sings happiness into Christian <lb/>
hearts. Her middle name, Ridley, was given <lb/>
her in memory of the great Oxford martyr of <lb/>
the sixteenth century; did she not bear it <lb/>
worthily? Hers was the living sacrifice, daily <lb/>
laid on the altar, a service of reason and <reg orig="per-|suasion">persuasion</reg>. <lb/>
Reverend James Davidson says: <lb/>
"She carved out a niche which she alone could <lb/>
fill. Simply and sweetly she sang the love of <lb/>
God and His way of salvation. &hellip; She lives <lb/>
and speaks in every line of her poetry. Her <lb/>
poems are permeated with the fragrance of her <lb/>
passionate love of Jesus."</p>
<p>After Miss Havergal's death, a sum of <lb/>
money amounting to nineteen hundred pounds <lb/>
was raised as a memorial to her, to be <lb/>
used for supporting native Bible women in <lb/>
India and circulating her books. Her life <lb/>
is her best memorial, however, just as, in <lb/>
turn, it is a memorial of her Saviour's power <lb/>
<pb n="195" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0234"/>
to save from sin and enrich the life of <lb/>
the believer. Her body was buried in a quiet <lb/>
English churchyard, and the stone bears this <lb/>
verse: "The blood of Jesus Christ His Son <lb/>
cleanseth us from all sin." No Scripture could <lb/>
be more fitting for her whose life was so truly <lb/>
redeemed and whose influence is still a <reg orig="redeem-|ing">redeeming</reg> <lb/>
force.</p>
<q><lg type="stanza">

RAMABAI DONGRE MEDHAVI</hi></head>
<byline><hi rend="small-caps">by john clair minot</hi></byline>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">In</hi> the religious system of the Hindu nation <lb/>
there is a goddess Rama whose name <lb/>
signifies "brightness" or "light." It was <lb/>
singularly appropriate that Ananta Shastri, a <lb/>
learned Brahman, and his young wife <reg orig="Lakshmi-|bai">Lakshmibai</reg>, <lb/>
gave the name of this goddess to the child <lb/>
who was born to them in 1858 in the jungle of <lb/>
Gungamal. There was little enough of <reg orig="bright-|ness">brightness</reg> <lb/>
in the lives of the parents to be sure, but <lb/>
the little daughter, Ramabai, has lived to <reg orig="be-|come">become</reg> <lb/>
a light that has pierced the sinister <lb/>
shadows which thickly envelop the womanhood <lb/>
of India. The work that she has established, <lb/>
made possible by the strength and beauty of <lb/>
her womanhood, has become a far-shining <reg orig="bea-|con">beacon</reg> <lb/>
to lead her sisters from the ignorance and <lb/>
superstition that have kept them in cruel <reg orig="dark-|ness">darkness</reg> <lb/>
through many centuries.</p>
<p>Of the numerous agencies, whether of native <lb/>
origin or resulting from the missionary spirit <lb/>
of England and America, which are seeking to <lb/>
free the women of India from the heavy <reg orig="bond-|age">bondage</reg> <lb/>
of the religious law and social customs of <lb/>
their race, none is to be rated higher in its <lb/>
practical methods or its far reaching influences, <lb/>
<pb entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0236"/>
<figure id="f9" rend="page" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0236">

<pb entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0237"/>
<pb n="197" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0238"/>
than that of which Ramabai has been the head <lb/>
and heart since she returned to India from <lb/>
America in 1889. The secular home and school <lb/>
in Poona for high-caste child widows and the <lb/>
Christian home and industrial farm school at <lb/>
Kedgaum, thirty-four miles distant, have done <lb/>
a work for thousands which is beyond <reg orig="meas-|urement">measurement</reg> <lb/>
by human standards. And the women <lb/>
whom she has saved from death and trained <lb/>
for useful lives are taking the lead in the <lb/>
emancipation and Christianization of the <lb/>
women of India.</p>
<p>Ramabai had an unusual heritage for the <lb/>
work to which she has given her life. Her <lb/>
father was of the ancient Mahratta race&mdash;a race <lb/>
of conquerors&mdash;which has played a remarkable <lb/>
part in Indian history. From him she <reg orig="re-|ceived">received</reg> <lb/>
the pluck, the perseverance, the <reg orig="inde-|pendence">independence</reg>, <lb/>
the forcefulness, and in general the <lb/>
strength of character that she has needed every <lb/>
day since her girlhood in the jungle. Though <lb/>
an orthodox Hindu and a strict adherent to <lb/>
caste and other religious rules, he in his own <lb/>
way was a reformer. He believed, for <reg orig="ex-|ample">example</reg>, <lb/>
that women had a right to an <reg orig="educa-|tion">education</reg>, <lb/>
and he practiced what he preached by <lb/>
teaching his child wife to read, to write and to <lb/>
understand sacred literature. This liberality <lb/>
was such an open disregard of the cherished <lb/>
traditions of the country and aroused such a <lb/>
storm of protest from his family that he was <lb/>
forced to take his wife far away to a solitary <lb/>
home in the forest.</p>
<pb n="198" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0239"/>
<p>The wife, who became the mother of three <lb/>
children of whom Ramabai was the youngest, <lb/>
was given to him in marriage in a way that well <lb/>
illustrates conditions in India. One day <lb/>
Ananta, while bathing in the sacred river, <lb/>
Godavery, met a striking looking pilgrim, who <lb/>
was likewise engaged. They fell to talking, <lb/>
and after a few preliminaries, the pilgrim <lb/>
offered his daughter, then only nine years old, <lb/>
to the strange Brahman pundit, as his wife. <lb/>
The offer was accepted and the marriage <reg orig="cere-|mony">ceremony</reg> <lb/>
was performed the next day. Thus <lb/>
Lakshmibai Dongre became the wife of Ananta <lb/>
Shastri and never saw her parents again, but <lb/>
her lot proved far happier than that of most <lb/>
of the millions of child brides of India.</p>
<p>The thatched hut to which Ananta Shastri <lb/>
took his girl wife, and where Ramabai was born <lb/>
a dozen years later, was in a dense forest on <lb/>
top of a peak of the Western Ghats. There <lb/>
the scholarly Brahman was able to study in <lb/>
peace, to educate his wife as he pleased, and <lb/>
to worship the gods of his faith far from the <lb/>
turmoil of the world. From his rice fields and <lb/>
cocoanut plantations near his old home, he <reg orig="re-|ceived">received</reg> <lb/>
an income sufficient for his needs. It <lb/>
chanced, however, that the mountain top was <lb/>
the object of sacred pilgrimages and he deemed <lb/>
it a religious duty to entertain all the pilgrims <lb/>
who came there. After a dozen years of this <lb/>
hospitality, it had to cease because his resources <lb/>
were utterly exhausted.</p>
<p>Thereupon with his wife and three children, <lb/>
<pb n="199" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0240"/>
Ananta Shastri left the mountain home and <lb/>
for the rest of his life was himself a religious <lb/>
pilgrim, wandering from one end of India to <lb/>
the other. At this time Ramabai was a baby <lb/>
of six months; she was brought from the <reg orig="moun-|tain">mountain</reg> <lb/>
top to the plains in a little basket of cane. <lb/>
Her earliest memory, she relates, and, indeed, <lb/>
all the memories of her girlhood and young <lb/>
womanhood, are associated with traveling&mdash; <lb/>
traveling from one city or village to another, <lb/>
often shelterless and hungry, visiting shrines <lb/>
and temples, worshiping images of the Hindu <lb/>
gods, and always reading aloud, either in the <lb/>
temples and public places, or in the shade by <lb/>
the roadside.</p>
<p>Of this period of her life, Ramabai writes as <lb/>
follows: "The reading of the Puranas served <lb/>
a double purpose; the first and foremost was <lb/>
that of getting rid of sin, and of earning merit <lb/>
in order to obtain Moksha, or liberation from <lb/>
a lower existence. The other purpose was to <lb/>
earn an honest living, without begging.</p>
<p>"The readers of Puranas&mdash;Puranikas as <lb/>
they are called&mdash;are the popular and public <lb/>
preachers of religion among the Hindus. They <lb/>
sit in some prominent places, in temple halls, <lb/>
or under the trees, or on the banks of rivers <lb/>
and tanks, with their manuscript books in their <lb/>
hands, and read the Puranas in a loud voice <lb/>
with intonation, so that the passers-by, or <lb/>
visitors of the temple may hear. The text, <lb/>
being in the Sanskrit language, is not <reg orig="under-|stood">understood</reg> <lb/>
by the hearers. The Puranikas are not <lb/>
<pb n="200" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0241"/>
obliged to explain it to them. They may or <lb/>
may not explain it as they choose. And <reg orig="some-|times">sometimes</reg> <lb/>
when it is translated and explained, the <lb/>
Puranika takes great pains to make his speech <lb/>
as popular as he can, by telling greatly <reg orig="exag-|gerated">exaggerated</reg> <lb/>
or untrue stories. This is not <reg orig="con-|sidered">considered</reg> <lb/>
sin, since it is done to attract common <lb/>
people's attention, that they may hear the <lb/>
sacred sound, the names of the gods, and some <lb/>
of their deeds, and be purified by this means. <lb/>
When the Puranika reads Puranas, the hearers, <lb/>
who are sure to come and sit around him for <lb/>
a few moments at least, generally give him <reg orig="pres-|ents">presents</reg>. <lb/>
The Puranika continues to read, paying <lb/>
no attention to what the hearers do or say. <lb/>
They come and go at their choice.</p>
<p>"When they come, the religious ones among <lb/>
them prostrate themselves before him and <reg orig="wor-|ship">worship</reg> <lb/>
him and the book, offering flowers, fruits, <lb/>
sweetmeats, garments, money and other things. <lb/>
It is supposed that this act brings a great deal <lb/>
of merit to the giver, and the person who <reg orig="re-|ceives">receives</reg> <lb/>
does not incur any sin. If a hearer does <lb/>
not give presents to the Puranika, he loses all <lb/>
the merit which he may have earned by good <lb/>
acts. The presents may not be very expensive <lb/>
ones; a handful of rice or other grains, a pice, <lb/>
or even a few cowries, which are used as an <reg orig="ex-|change">exchange</reg> <lb/>
of pice&mdash;64 cowrie shells are equal to <lb/>
one pice&mdash;are quite acceptable. A flower, or <lb/>
even a petal of a flower, or a leaf of any good <lb/>
sacred tree, is acceptable to the gods. But the <lb/>
offerer knows well that his store of merit will <lb/>
<pb n="201" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0242"/>
be according to what he gives, and he tries to <lb/>
be as generous as he can. So the Puranika gets <lb/>
all that he needs by reading Puranas in public <lb/>
places."</p>
<p>Thus passed year after year. When <reg orig="Rama-|bai">Ramabai</reg> <lb/>
was about eight years old her education <lb/>
began at the hands of her mother, and it <reg orig="con-|tinued">continued</reg> <lb/>
with system and thoroughness until she <lb/>
was fifteen. Never until she left India, did she <lb/>
attend school. She learned to speak half a <lb/>
dozen tongues and gained a wonderful <reg orig="knowl-|edge">knowledge</reg> <lb/>
of the Sanskrit language and literature. <lb/>
English language and literature, however, was <lb/>
excluded from her education, for it was a firm <lb/>
belief of her faith that to come in contact with <lb/>
English people, or even to learn their language, <lb/>
was to lose caste and all hope of future <reg orig="happi-|ness">happiness</reg>.</p>
<p>Although he was a loyal Brahman in many <lb/>
respects, her father refused to follow the <reg orig="cus-|tom">custom</reg> <lb/>
of giving his little daughter in marriage <lb/>
when she became nine years old. Largely on <lb/>
account of this refusal and because of his <reg orig="ad-|vanced">advanced</reg> <lb/>
views on the education of women, he was <lb/>
virtually ostracized by those of his caste in <lb/>
his last years when he became feeble and blind. <lb/>
Ramabai loved and honored her father, but she <lb/>
revered the memory of her mother, as a teacher, <lb/>
no less than in the intimate relation of <reg orig="mother-|hood">motherhood</reg>. <lb/>
When she published her remarkable <lb/>
book <hi rend="italic">The High-Caste Hindu Woman</hi> in <reg orig="Bos-|ton">Boston</reg> <lb/>
in 1887 she dedicated it "to the memory of <lb/>
my beloved mother, Lakshmibai Dongre, whose <lb/>
<pb n="202" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0243"/>
sweet influence and able instruction have been <lb/>
the light and guide of my life."</p>
<p>The awful famine season of 1874 broke up <lb/>
the family group. Within a few months of <lb/>
each other, the father, mother and older sister <lb/>
all died of starvation. The brother and <reg orig="Rama-|bai">Ramabai</reg>, <lb/>
who was then sixteen, somehow managed to <lb/>
live, and continued to lead the only life that <lb/>
they had known. The brother and sister, being <lb/>
high-caste, were too proud to do menial work, <lb/>
and their education, which was mainly in the <lb/>
sacred literature of the Hindus, offered them <lb/>
no practical way to earn a living. So they <lb/>
wandered from place to place, studying, <reg orig="wor-|shiping">worshiping</reg>, <lb/>
and reading in public places. In the <lb/>
three years following the death of their <reg orig="par-|ents">parents</reg> <lb/>
and sister, they walked more than four <lb/>
thousand miles, and suffered many privations. <lb/>
Much of the time they had no shelter except <lb/>
the free lodgings for the poor, which are <reg orig="com-|mon">common</reg> <lb/>
to pilgrims and travelers of all except the <lb/>
low castes.</p>
<p>During this period, Ramabai's faith in the <lb/>
religion of her ancestors grew weaker and <lb/>
weaker. She saw that the fulfillment of the <lb/>
hard conditions laid down in the sacred books <lb/>
did not bring the promised rewards. <reg orig="Obe-|dience">Obedience</reg> <lb/>
to the rules of the gods brought no favor <lb/>
or recognition. Worship, according to the <lb/>
rites she had been taught, left in her soul an <lb/>
ever unsatisfied hunger. It was in this restless <lb/>
spiritual mood, that she and her brother <reg orig="ar-|rived">arrived</reg> <lb/>
in Calcutta in 1878. In the twelve <lb/>
<pb n="203" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0244"/>
months that they remained there, during her <lb/>
twentieth year, her exceptional mental <reg orig="attain-|ments">attainments</reg> <lb/>
won for her the recognition of the wise <lb/>
men of her race&mdash;and she took her first steps <lb/>
towards the acceptance of Christianity.</p>
<p>So rare a thing in India is an educated <lb/>
woman that the fame of Ramabai had reached <lb/>
the ears of the pundits, or learned men, of <reg orig="Cal-|cutta">Calcutta</reg>. <lb/>
By giving her an education, had not her <lb/>
father, a high-caste Brahman, defied social <reg orig="cus-|toms">customs</reg> <lb/>
and religious teachings? Had not she <lb/>
been equally bold&mdash;she who had read the sacred <lb/>
writings in public, and lectured in many towns <lb/>
in behalf of education and other privileges for <lb/>
the women of India? So they summoned her <lb/>
before them, heard her story, and gave her a <lb/>
long and searching examination. It was a <lb/>
severe test; but she did not flinch. Her <reg orig="self-|possession">self-possession</reg> <lb/>
and modesty, her mastery of <reg orig="lan-|guages">languages</reg> <lb/>
and literature, her logic in defending <lb/>
her rights as a woman, completely won the <lb/>
learned men from their conservatism and their <lb/>
prejudice against her. They accorded her <lb/>
frank praise instead of the censure that she <lb/>
had expected; in recognition of her merit they <lb/>
publicly conferred upon her the title of <hi rend="italic"><reg orig="Sar-|asvati">Sarasvati</reg></hi>, <lb/>
Goddess of Wisdom. From that time <lb/>
this title has often been added to her name, and <lb/>
even more frequently the title Pundita has been <lb/>
prefixed. Not only has she become known the <lb/>
world over as "the Pundita Ramabai," but she <lb/>
is frequently referred to as "the Pundita," so <lb/>
absolutely pre&euml;minent for her learning and <lb/>
<pb n="204" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0245"/>
wisdom is she among all the millions of native <lb/>
women of India.</p>
<p>About this same time, she and her brother <lb/>
accepted an invitation to attend a social <reg orig="gather-|ing">gathering</reg> <lb/>
of Christians. There they met people of <lb/>
their own caste who had been converted to <lb/>
Christianity. At first they were shocked to see <lb/>
Brahmans talking and eating with the English <lb/>
men and women. So crude was Ramabai's <lb/>
idea of Christian worship that she thought the <lb/>
people were paying homage to their chairs <lb/>
when they knelt before them to pray. A copy <lb/>
of the Bible in Sanskrit was given her, and she <lb/>
took it home with her. "I tried to read it, but <lb/>
did not understand," she writes. "The <reg orig="lan-|guage">language</reg> <lb/>
was so different that at first I thought it <lb/>
a waste of time to read it. But I have never <lb/>
parted with it since that time."</p>
<p>As she studied and lectured in Calcutta, new <lb/>
thoughts woke in her heart and a new longing <lb/>
filled her life. Suddenly her beloved brother <lb/>
died, and she was alone and almost friendless <lb/>
in a country where women are wholly <reg orig="depend-|ent">dependent</reg> <lb/>
upon their male relatives. But among her <lb/>
friends was a young Bengali lawyer, Bipin <lb/>
Bihari Medhavi, a graduate of the Calcutta <lb/>
University. He had studied in a mission <lb/>
school and like Ramabai he had thrown aside <lb/>
the old belief, but had not joined the <reg orig="Chris-|tians">Christians</reg>. <lb/>
He sympathized with the liberal views <lb/>
of the Pundita and with her unselfish plans, as <lb/>
dimly formed, for helping the women of her <lb/>
race. That he was of a lower caste than hers <lb/>
<pb n="205" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0246"/>
&mdash;of the fourth, or Shundra caste&mdash;would have <lb/>
been an insuperable barrier between them in <lb/>
spite of his high character and attainments <lb/>
had she still been of the faith in which she was <lb/>
reared. But she had definitely abandoned that <lb/>
faith, and when they knew they loved each other <lb/>
they were at once married. This was in 1880, <lb/>
a few months after the brother's death, when <lb/>
she was in her twenty-second year. Had not <lb/>
her father sacrificed his own caste standing for <lb/>
the sake of her education and happiness, she <lb/>
would have been given in marriage at the age <lb/>
of nine.</p>
<p>For nearly two years Ramabai knew a happy <lb/>
home life, of which the supreme happiness was <lb/>
the birth of a daughter who was named <reg orig='Manor-|ama,&mdash;"heart&apos;s'>Manorama,&mdash;"heart&apos;s</reg> <lb/>
joy." Then her husband died <lb/>
suddenly of the cholera; with her baby she faced <lb/>
the world alone again&mdash;this time belonging to <lb/>
the most unhappy class of all the unhappy <lb/>
women of India, a sonless widow. To add to <lb/>
her lonely desolation, her relatives and former <lb/>
friends had only contempt for her because she <lb/>
had married out of her caste. Their complaint <lb/>
was not so much that she had married a man <lb/>
of inferior caste as that she had married out of <lb/>
her own caste, for her husband had likewise <lb/>
suffered for marrying her&mdash;though he was of <lb/>
the fourth caste and she of the highest. Even <lb/>
his own brother had not dared to write to him <lb/>
for fear of losing caste&mdash;and the loss of caste <lb/>
means to the Hindu millions of reincarnations <lb/>
before it can be regained.</p>
<pb n="206" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0247"/>
<p>For some time before the death of her <reg orig="hus-|band">husband</reg> <lb/>
the purpose had been forming in the heart <lb/>
of Ramabai to devote her life to improving the <lb/>
condition of the women of India; in this <reg orig="un-|selfish">unselfish</reg> <lb/>
ambition her husband had fully <reg orig="sym-|pathized">sympathized</reg>. <lb/>
In her travels from one end of the <lb/>
country to the other, during the years since <lb/>
her infancy, it had been her privilege as a <lb/>
Brahman to have free access to the homes of <lb/>
the high-caste Hindus. Her soul revolted at <lb/>
the cruelties to which she saw the women <reg orig="sub-|jected">subjected</reg> <lb/>
by the social custom and religious <reg orig="regula-|tions">regulations</reg> <lb/>
of her people. If the miserable lot of <lb/>
the child wife filled her with pity, she was far <lb/>
more deeply moved by the harder fate of the <lb/>
child widow, who, more especially if she has <lb/>
borne no son, becomes a pitiable outcast, <reg orig="re-|viled">reviled</reg>, <lb/>
abused and shunned by her husband's <reg orig="rel-|atives">relatives</reg> <lb/>
and by the whole community. Once the <lb/>
child widows of India commonly found release <lb/>
from their miserable existence, and as they <reg orig="be-|lieved">believed</reg>, <lb/>
a prompt admission to heaven, by <lb/>
suicide on the funeral pyres of their husbands. <lb/>
This terrible custom, called the rite of <hi rend="italic">suttee</hi>, <lb/>
has been forbidden by British law since 1829, <lb/>
but has nevertheless been practiced in many <reg orig="in-|stances">instances</reg> <lb/>
in later years.</p>
<p>Throughout India widowhood is regarded as <lb/>
the punishment for crimes committed by the <lb/>
woman in her previous existence on the earth. <lb/>
Disobedience or disloyalty to the husband are <lb/>
the crimes punished in the present birth by <lb/>
widowhood, according to the Hindu conception. <lb/>
<pb n="207" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0248"/>
If the widow is a mother of sons the social <lb/>
mistreatment and hatred of which she is the <lb/>
object are greatly lessened by the fact that she <lb/>
has brought superior beings into the world; <lb/>
yet she is looked upon as a sinner without hope <lb/>
of happiness in this life or the next one. The <lb/>
widow who is the mother of girls is much worse <lb/>
off, particularly if her daughters have not been <lb/>
given in marriage during the life of her <reg orig="hus-|band">husband</reg>. <lb/>
But it is upon the child-widow and the <lb/>
childless girl widow that falls the greatest <lb/>
abuse&mdash;from her own family as well as from <lb/>
the community. She is considered the great <lb/>
criminal upon whom the judgment of the gods <lb/>
has been pronounced.</p>
<p>The young widow is at once stripped of all <lb/>
her ornaments, of her bright garments and all <lb/>
the little things that she has loved to have on <lb/>
her person or near her. The cruelty of this <lb/>
deprivation lies in the fact that from earliest <lb/>
childhood she has been the slave of her own <lb/>
petty interests, and the passionate lover of <lb/>
ornaments and self adornment. In many cases, <lb/>
too, her head is shaved of the wealth of long <lb/>
and glossy hair which nature has given her. <lb/>
The only clothing left her is a single coarse <lb/>
garment. She is closely confined to the dark <lb/>
part of the house and often as strictly guarded <lb/>
as though she were a prisoner. The object of <lb/>
all this humiliation is to punish and mortify <lb/>
her, and to keep her from improper or <reg orig="indis-|creet">indiscreet</reg> <lb/>
acts that would bring disgrace on the <lb/>
family name.</p>
<pb n="208" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0249"/>
<p>Nor is this all; the widow is allowed but one <lb/>
meal during the twenty-four hours; she must <lb/>
never take part in family feasts or jubilees; she <lb/>
must not even show herself to people on <reg orig="auspi-|cious">auspicious</reg> <lb/>
occasions. A Hindu thinks it highly <reg orig="un-|lucky">unlucky</reg> <lb/>
to see a widow early in the morning, and <lb/>
will cover her with curses if so seen. A <reg orig="pros-|pective">prospective</reg> <lb/>
traveler will postpone his journey if his <lb/>
path is crossed by a widow at the time <lb/>
of his departure. The name <foreign lang="dut"><hi rend="italic">rand</hi></foreign> by which <lb/>
she is generally known is a term of <reg orig="bit-|ter">bitter</reg> <lb/>
contempt. There is scarcely a day in <lb/>
which she is not beaten, or abused as the cause <lb/>
of her husband's death by his relatives and <lb/>
neighbors. If her husband has no relatives she <lb/>
goes back to live with her own people. <reg orig="Al-|though">Although</reg> <lb/>
then she has somewhat less to suffer, <lb/>
custom and religious faith have a stronger hold <lb/>
upon her parents than parental love. She is <lb/>
closely confined, forbidden to associate with <lb/>
anybody outside of the immediate family and <lb/>
watched with great concern, lest she bring <reg orig="fur-|ther">further</reg> <lb/>
disgrace upon the family. Her life is <lb/>
empty of pleasure or hope; she cannot look <reg orig="for-|ward">forward</reg> <lb/>
to another marriage; she is simply a curse <lb/>
to herself and to society.</p>
<p>If she runs away, what is her fate? No <reg orig="re-|spectable">respectable</reg> <lb/>
family, even of a lower caste, will <lb/>
have her for a servant. She has no art or trade <lb/>
by which she can earn an honest living. She <lb/>
has nothing but the single garment that she <lb/>
wears. The only alternatives are suicide or&mdash; <lb/>
a hideous life-in-death. For untold centuries, <lb/>
<pb n="209" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0250"/>
millions of the child widows of India have been <lb/>
driven to this fate.</p>
<p>Before Ramabai herself had been forced into <lb/>
this most unhappy class of all unhappy India, <lb/>
she had decided to take active measure for the <lb/>
relief of widows. Her husband and she were <lb/>
planning to establish, on a small scale, a refuge <lb/>
and school in their own home when his sudden <lb/>
death put an end to the project. Her <reg orig="determina-|tion">determination</reg> <lb/>
to carry on the work on which she had set <lb/>
her heart was unaltered, however, and she <reg orig="deter-|mined">determined</reg> <lb/>
to do what she could, by lecturing and <lb/>
personal appeals, to start a general agitation <lb/>
for the emancipation and education of women. <lb/>
She left Calcutta and went to Poona where she <lb/>
remained about a year. There, among the <lb/>
people of her own race, she was received with <lb/>
kindness and given help and encouragement. <lb/>
She founded a society, the special object of <lb/>
which was to discourage child marriage, and in <lb/>
this connection, before a British commission, <lb/>
she gave evidence that made much of a stir in <lb/>
England.</p>
<p>As Ramabai was now studying the English <lb/>
language, she frequently met the European <reg orig="mis-|sionaries">missionaries</reg>. <lb/>
From them, little by little, she <lb/>
learned the great truths of Christianity, and <lb/>
the seed that had been left by that chance visit <lb/>
to a mission in Calcutta, before her marriage, <lb/>
began to take root. Yet she was slow in <reg orig="accept-|ing">accepting</reg> <lb/>
the Christian religion as her own in place <lb/>
of the inherited faith that she had definitely <lb/>
abandoned years ago. Her husband had not <lb/>
<pb n="210" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0251"/>
taken kindly to her acquaintance with the <reg orig="mis-|sionaries">missionaries</reg> <lb/>
in Calcutta, and had forbidden them <lb/>
to come to his house. Many years later, in <reg orig="dis-|cussing">discussing</reg> <lb/>
her first leaning toward Christianity, <lb/>
Ramabai wrote: "I do not know what would <lb/>
have happened had my husband lived much <lb/>
longer."</p>
<p>It was through her growing friendship with <lb/>
the missionaries at Poona that Ramabai <reg orig="real-|ized">realized</reg> <lb/>
her own lack of preparation and training <lb/>
for the work she hoped to do in India. <reg orig="Conse-|quently">Consequently</reg>, <lb/>
after many misgivings, she decided to <lb/>
go to England to study. This decision meant <lb/>
crossing the sea, the "black water" of which <lb/>
all Hindus have a religious horror; only the <reg orig="im-|pulse">impulse</reg> <lb/>
of her high purpose enabled her to take <lb/>
the step that meant the turning point of her life <lb/>
&mdash;and, no doubt, of the woman-life of all India. <lb/>
Early in 1883, accompanied by her baby <reg orig="daugh-|ter">daughter</reg>, <lb/>
she made the journey and went directly to <lb/>
St. Mary's Home, an institution of the English <lb/>
church, at Wantage. There the sisters, one of <lb/>
whom she had known in Poona, gave her a warm <lb/>
welcome and a most favorable opportunity to <lb/>
pursue her studies in both secular and religious <lb/>
subjects. As soon as she had mastered the <lb/>
English language, she was appointed professor <lb/>
of Sanskrit in Cheltenham Female College, <lb/>
where, in addition to her teaching, she studied <lb/>
the sciences, English literature, higher <reg orig="math-|ematics">mathematics</reg> <lb/>
and Greek.</p>
<p>Soon after her arrival in England, the sisters <lb/>
of St. Mary's took Ramabai for a time to a <lb/>
<pb n="211" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0252"/>
branch of their home in London where she <lb/>
watched their rescue work for the unfortunate <lb/>
women of the great metropolis. The results <lb/>
there showed her, if more evidence was needed, <lb/>
the great vital difference between Christianity <lb/>
and Hinduism. The Hindu religion offers <lb/>
neither pity nor hope to fallen or down-trodden <lb/>
women, and makes no effort to transform or <lb/>
uplift them. Soon after, in September 1883, <lb/>
she and her little daughter, were baptized in <lb/>
the Episcopal church at Wantage. Of that <lb/>
time she writes: "My heart was drawn to the <lb/>
religion of Christ and I was intellectually <reg orig="con-|vinced">convinced</reg> <lb/>
of its truth. I felt a great joy in finding <lb/>
a new religion which was better than any other <lb/>
religion I had known before. I knew full well <lb/>
that it would displease my friends and <reg orig="country-|men">countrymen</reg> <lb/>
very much, but I have never regretted <reg orig="tak-|ing">taking</reg> <lb/>
the step. I was hungry for something <reg orig="bet-|ter">better</reg> <lb/>
than what the Hindu Shastras gave. I <lb/>
found it in the Christian's Bible and was <reg orig="satis-|fied">satisfied</reg>."</p>
<p>However, Ramabai did not feel that she had <lb/>
really found Christ until a long time after she <lb/>
accepted the Christian religion. During the six <lb/>
years of her stay in England and America she <lb/>
studied the subject deeply, and for a time was <lb/>
much bewildered at the multiplicity of Christian <lb/>
sects and the confusion of their doctrines. <lb/>
In the differences of orthodox and unorthodox <lb/>
Christian sects, she met greater intellectual and <lb/>
spiritual difficulties, and for years her heart <lb/>
yearned for something that she did not find. <lb/>
<pb n="212" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0253"/>
It was not until some time after her return <lb/>
to India from America in 1889 that she was <lb/>
able to write: "I have come to know the <lb/>
Lord Jesus Christ as my personal Saviour, and <lb/>
to have the joy of sweet communion with him." <lb/>
Since then there has been no doubt or dismay <lb/>
in her spiritual life, and a zeal for evangelism, <lb/>
to carry the gospel of salvation to others, has <lb/>
been her consuming passion.</p>
<p>After nearly three years with the sisters at <lb/>
Wantage and at the Cheltenham Female <reg orig="Col-|lege">College</reg>, <lb/>
Ramabai came to America in February, <lb/>
1886. The immediate occasion of the journey <lb/>
was the graduation of her cousin, Anandibai <lb/>
Joshee, from the Woman's Medical College in <lb/>
Philadelphia. This cousin, who like Ramabai, <lb/>
aimed to help the women of her native land, <lb/>
was training herself for the work by securing <lb/>
a medical education. Because the bond of the <lb/>
common purpose between them was stronger <lb/>
than the ties of blood, at home she had been one <lb/>
of the few of the kin of Ramabai who had been <lb/>
kind to her in the early days of her widowhood. <lb/>
Her degree of Doctor of Medicine was the first <lb/>
ever conferred on a Hindu woman. It was a <lb/>
great loss to India when Anandibai Joshee died <lb/>
in February, 1887, a few months after her <reg orig="re-|turn">return</reg> <lb/>
home, at the age of twenty-two.</p>
<p>When Ramabai arrived in Philadelphia, she <lb/>
expected to return to England in a short time, <lb/>
and thence to India. But Dean Rachel L. <reg orig="Bod-|ley">Bodley</reg> <lb/>
of the Woman's Medical College, who took <lb/>
Ramabai to her heart and home, encouraged <lb/>
<pb n="213" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0254"/>
her to remain and mature her plans in the <lb/>
United States. In England she had studied <lb/>
hard and had profited much intellectually and <lb/>
spiritually, but she was still with no well <reg orig="formu-|lated">formulated</reg> <lb/>
method of procedure for her work in <reg orig="In-|dia">India</reg>. <lb/>
In America those plans soon began to <lb/>
take definite shape. It was in the public school <lb/>
system, especially the kindergarten and <reg orig="indus-|trial">industrial</reg> <lb/>
branches, that she found the solution of her <lb/>
problem. With the help of her many new <lb/>
friends she began to consider the ways and <lb/>
means of realizing the great dream of her life.</p>
<p>While studying the working of the school <lb/>
system she wrote her book, <hi rend="italic">The High-Caste <lb/>
Hindu Woman</hi>, which appeared in 1887 with <lb/>
an introduction by Dean Bodley. The <reg orig="intro-|duction">introduction</reg> <lb/>
to the second edition in 1901 was by <lb/>
Mrs. Judith W. Andrews of Boston, long one <lb/>
of Ramabai's most loyal friends in America. <lb/>
From the first the book produced a deep <reg orig="impres-|sion">impression</reg>, <lb/>
and aroused a widespread interest in the <lb/>
unhappy lot of the women of India and in the <lb/>
work that the author proposed to do in their <reg orig="be-|half">behalf</reg>. <lb/>
Ramabai was the first writer to set forth <lb/>
from first hand knowledge the complete and <reg orig="in-|timate">intimate</reg> <lb/>
story of a Hindu woman's life&mdash;her <reg orig="hope-|less">hopeless</reg> <lb/>
and helpless position as defined by religion <lb/>
and custom, her few joys, her many sorrows and <lb/>
her great needs. She told of the practice of <lb/>
female infanticide, the child marriages, the <reg orig="con-|tempt">contempt</reg> <lb/>
and cruelty that crush the sonless widow. <lb/>
Much that she wrote about was generally known <lb/>
in America through accounts of missionaries <lb/>
<pb n="214" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0255"/>
and travelers, but perhaps the general public <lb/>
had been inclined to regard their narratives as <lb/>
too highly colored. No reader could doubt what <lb/>
Ramabai wrote&mdash;it was all expressed so clearly, <lb/>
so earnestly, so authoritatively and yet so <reg orig="tem-|perately">temperately</reg>. <lb/>
The masterly style of the book is as <lb/>
remarkable as the matter presented. Later, in <lb/>
1907, she wrote another noteworthy book, <hi rend="italic">A <lb/>
Testimony</hi>, which is an account of her own life, <lb/>
and especially of her religious experiences.</p>
<p>When her book had appeared in 1887, <reg orig="Ram-|abai">Ramabai</reg> <lb/>
began to make her appeal to America for <lb/>
funds to enable her to establish a school and <lb/>
refuge for the high-caste child widows of her <lb/>
native land. She asked, moreover, that her <lb/>
friends form themselves into an association to <lb/>
be the custodian of the money that might be <lb/>
raised and to which she should be responsible <lb/>
for its use.</p>
<p>In May, 1887, at a public meeting held in <lb/>
Boston, a provisional committee was appointed <lb/>
to consider Ramabai's plan, to act as far as <lb/>
possible, and to report at a later meeting. In <lb/>
December this committee presented a report <lb/>
that was accepted, officers were elected, a <reg orig="con-|stitution">constitution</reg> <lb/>
was adopted, and the temporary <lb/>
American Ramabai Association became an <reg orig="or-|ganization">organization</reg>. <lb/>
It sprang into existence, and <lb/>
Ramabai saw her long cherished plan take <reg orig="def-|inite">definite</reg> <lb/>
form. That night her joy was too great <lb/>
for sleep; when found sobbing in her room, she <lb/>
explained, "I am crying for joy that my dream <lb/>
of years has become a reality." Among the <lb/>
<pb n="215" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0256"/>
officers of the association were Edward Everett <lb/>
Hale, Phillips Brooks, Lyman Abbott, George A. <lb/>
Gordon, Mrs. Mary Hemenway, Dean Rachel L. <lb/>
Bodley, and Frances E. Willard&mdash;a rare body <lb/>
of officers, Unitarian, Episcopalian, <reg orig="Congrega-|tionalist">Congregationalist</reg>, <lb/>
Baptist and Methodist. The board of <lb/>
trustees, consisting of business men and the <lb/>
executive committee of philanthropic women, <lb/>
were equally undenominational. The <reg orig="associa-|tion">association</reg> <lb/>
pledged itself to the support of a secular <lb/>
school for ten years&mdash;a school in which no <reg orig="re-|ligious">religious</reg> <lb/>
instruction either Hindu or Christian <lb/>
should be given. The Bible and the Vedas were <lb/>
to stand side by side in the school library, free <lb/>
to all. The caste rules were to be observed, but <lb/>
there were to be no public religious observances <lb/>
of any kind. This was Ramabai's pledge to her <lb/>
own and the American people&mdash;a pledge she <lb/>
kept inviolate.</p>
<p>After the formation of the association <reg orig="Ram-|abai">Ramabai</reg> <lb/>
considered herself its servant. From <lb/>
May, 1887, to November, 1888, this dauntless <lb/>
little woman of thirty, in the midst of a strange <lb/>
people, strange customs and manners, eating <lb/>
neither "fish, flesh or fowl," often hungry and <lb/>
cold, showed a degree of mental and physical <lb/>
endurance that was marvelous, even in the eyes <lb/>
of Americans.</p>
<p>A lady who was present at one of her <reg orig="meet-|ings">meetings</reg> <lb/>
described her appearance at that time: <lb/>
"Ramabai is strikingly beautiful; her face is a <lb/>
clear-cut oval; her eyes, large and dark, glow <lb/>
with feeling. She is a brunette, but her cheeks <lb/>
<pb n="216" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0257"/>
are full of color. Her white widow's saree is <lb/>
drawn closely over her head and fastened under <lb/>
her chin."</p>
<p>The Boston association, however, was not <lb/>
enough. Protected from insult by her pure <lb/>
womanliness and strong personality, she <reg orig="trav-|eled">traveled</reg> <lb/>
from Canada to the Pacific coast, <reg orig="lectur-|ing">lecturing</reg>, <lb/>
forming circles, studying educational, <reg orig="phil-|anthropic">philanthropic</reg> <lb/>
and charitable institutions, omitting <lb/>
nothing that might prove helpful to her people. <lb/>
Reaching the Pacific coast, her appeals won the <lb/>
sympathy of ministers of all <reg orig="creeds&mdash;Protes-|tant">creeds&mdash;Protestant</reg>, <lb/>
Catholic and Hebrew&mdash;of earnest women <lb/>
and business men. As the result, an auxiliary <lb/>
association was there formed that sent $5,000 <lb/>
to the treasury the first year. In November, <lb/>
1888, with an assured annual income sufficient <lb/>
for the support of a secular school of fifty pupils <lb/>
for ten years, Ramabai bade good-by to a land <lb/>
that had grown very dear to her, and turned <lb/>
her face homeward, bright with hope, and with <lb/>
a brave heart, though she knew not how her <lb/>
countrymen would receive her.</p>
<p>She sailed from San Francisco for Bombay <lb/>
by way of Japan and China, and in February, <lb/>
1889, she stood again on the shores of her native <lb/>
land, after an absence of six years. She found <lb/>
many to welcome her and to encourage her in <lb/>
her plans, and in less than six weeks the school <lb/>
of which she had dreamed for many years was <lb/>
opened in Bombay. There were two high-caste <lb/>
child widows as its first day pupils&mdash;one of <lb/>
them a girl who had thrice attempted suicide, <lb/>
<pb n="217" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0258"/>
restrained only by the fear of being born again <lb/>
a woman. To her school Ramabai gave the <lb/>
name of Sharada Sadan&mdash;Home of Wisdom&mdash; <lb/>
for it was meant from the beginning to be a <lb/>
home as well as a school.</p>
<p>Such was the modest beginning in 1889 of the <lb/>
real work of Ramabai for the womanhood of <lb/>
India&mdash;a work that has now continued for <reg orig="al-|most">almost</reg> <lb/>
a quarter of a century with constantly <reg orig="in-|creasing">increasing</reg> <lb/>
scope and with greater and greater <lb/>
effectiveness. In the first year, the school <lb/>
gained in reputation and numbers far beyond <lb/>
the expectations of Ramabai or her friends in <lb/>
America. It was soon removed from Bombay <lb/>
to Poona, the former home of Ramabai and a <lb/>
stronghold of Brahmanism, where it has since <lb/>
remained. In 1893, when the number of pupils <lb/>
had grown to about fifty, the school was bitterly <lb/>
attacked by the Brahmans on the ground that its <lb/>
head was violating her pledge to keep the school <lb/>
a secular institution and not to lead its pupils <lb/>
away from their religion into Christianity. <lb/>
Over thirty of the pupils were withdrawn and <lb/>
the future seemed very dark. The investigation <lb/>
that followed vindicated Ramabai. It was <lb/>
shown that she had not broken her engagement <lb/>
to keep the school unsectarian, and that she was <lb/>
not to be blamed if some of her pupils, under the <lb/>
influence of her strong personality, contrasted <lb/>
her religion with that which they had known <lb/>
and sought Christian baptism. The clouds <lb/>
cleared away, the old pupils came back with new <lb/>
ones with them.</p>
<pb n="218" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0259"/>
<p>The agitation, however, resulted in a <reg orig="recon-|struction">reconstruction</reg> <lb/>
of the Hindu advisory committee of <lb/>
the institution, and in the understanding that <lb/>
every pupil should henceforth receive religious <lb/>
instruction, while retaining perfect liberty of <lb/>
conscience. So, while the Sharada Sadan has <lb/>
remained nominally secular the Christian <reg orig="in-|fluence">influence</reg>, <lb/>
resulting from the evangelical zeal of <lb/>
Ramabai, has radiated to every part of India.</p>
<p>When the school had been in operation a few <lb/>
years, Ramabai was able, through the <reg orig="gener-|osity">generosity</reg> <lb/>
of American friends, to buy a large farm <lb/>
at Kedgaum, not far from Poona. Here she <lb/>
established an avowedly Christian home and <reg orig="in-|dustrial">industrial</reg> <lb/>
school which she named <reg orig="Mukti&mdash;Sal-|vation">Mukti&mdash;Salvation</reg>. <lb/>
This estate has supplied Sharada <reg orig="Sa-|dan">Sadan</reg> <lb/>
with vegetables and milk, and its products <lb/>
have added materially to the funds available <lb/>
for her work. Moreover, on the farm itself, she <lb/>
has cared for and trained hundreds of girls and <lb/>
women.</p>
<p>The first great work at Mukti was in the <lb/>
famine year of 1897. She hastened to the <lb/>
famine-stricken district of Central India and <lb/>
rescued over five hundred child widows and <reg orig="de-|serted">deserted</reg> <lb/>
girl wives, of whom she sheltered and <lb/>
fed three hundred at her farm. These waifs <lb/>
of famine and ostracism are portrayed as "<reg orig="noth-|ing">nothing</reg> <lb/>
but skeletons, and like the beasts of the <lb/>
jungle." Think what it meant for one woman <lb/>
to do this work of rescue under such conditions! <lb/>
At the same time she was superintending the <lb/>
erection of buildings, the digging of wells, the <lb/>
<pb n="219" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0260"/>
cultivation of fields and the establishment of <lb/>
various industries on the farm&mdash;not to mention <lb/>
the carrying on of the school at Poona.</p>
<p>The next year, 1898, saw the expiration of the <lb/>
ten year period for which the American <reg orig="Ram-|abai">Ramabai</reg> <lb/>
Association had pledged its support of her <lb/>
work, and, at the invitation of the Association, <lb/>
Ramabai made a journey to Boston to meet her <lb/>
loyal friends again, and to talk over the future. <lb/>
At the annual meeting of the Association in <lb/>
March the marvelous success of the first ten <lb/>
years' experience was reviewed. It was shown <lb/>
that the buildings and equipment of the Sharada <lb/>
Sadan at Poona were worth $50,000 and that <lb/>
they were wholly free from debt. This <reg orig="prop-|erty">property</reg> <lb/>
was then, and has since continued to <lb/>
be, held by the Association, in accordance with <lb/>
the wish of Ramabai. The great farm and <reg orig="in-|dustrial">industrial</reg> <lb/>
school at Kedgaum are held by <reg orig="Ram-|abai">Ramabai</reg> <lb/>
herself. In those first ten years the <reg orig="Ameri-|can">American</reg> <lb/>
Ramabai Association sent $95,500 to the <lb/>
support of the work. The Poona school in that <lb/>
time had educated and sheltered three hundred <lb/>
and fifty child widows, of whom scores had gone <lb/>
forth to found schools of their own, to serve as <lb/>
missionaries or housekeepers or to become <lb/>
voluntary Christian workers in missionary <lb/>
fields.</p>
<p>As a result of this showing of definite results, <lb/>
the Association was incorporated and <reg orig="reorga-|nized">reorganized</reg> <lb/>
to carry on the work on a still larger scale. <lb/>
Ramabai went back to India happy in the <reg orig="realiz-|ation">realization</reg> <lb/>
that her fondest prayers were being <reg orig="an-|swered">answered</reg>. <lb/>
<pb n="220" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0261"/>
In the following three years no less <lb/>
than $50,000 was sent her&mdash;a sum which she <lb/>
used wisely and prudently in meeting the great <lb/>
needs of her undertaking. The financial <reg orig="sup-|port">support</reg> <lb/>
given by her American friends has <reg orig="con-|tinued">continued</reg> <lb/>
to the present time. It cannot be <lb/>
doubted that it will continue as long as she lives <lb/>
to continue the work, or while her successors are <lb/>
accomplishing results equally necessary and <lb/>
valuable.</p>
<p>In 1900 Manorama, the daughter of Ramabai, <lb/>
graduated from the Chesborough Seminary, <lb/>
North Chili, New York, and unselfishly put <lb/>
aside her hope for a college course to return <lb/>
to India and become vice-principal of the <reg orig="Shar-|ada">Sharada</reg> <lb/>
Sadan. There she has taken on more and <lb/>
more of the responsibilities and duties of her <lb/>
mother, and the 1912 report to the American <lb/>
Ramabai Association was wholly her own. <lb/>
Then there were one hundred and fifteen girls <lb/>
and women in the Sharada Sadan, and one <lb/>
hundred and seventy-two on the farm and in the <lb/>
Mukti school.</p>
<p>The name of Ramabai deserves a high place <lb/>
on the roll of the heroic women of our time. <lb/>
Overcoming almost smothering obstacles, she <lb/>
has accomplished for her sex and her race a <lb/>
work which only the Judge of all achievements <lb/>
can properly estimate. The long, hard years <lb/>
of preparation have been followed by almost <lb/>
a quarter of a century of wonderful fruition <lb/>
&mdash;a glorious harvest to crown all the service <lb/>
<pb n="221" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0262"/>
and sacrifice. And in that vast empire where <lb/>
she has lived and labored million upon million <lb/>
of women yet unborn will learn to bless her <lb/>
name.</p>

MAUD BALLINGTON BOOTH</hi></head>
<byline><hi rend="small-caps">by r. v. trevel</hi></byline>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">A life</hi> of action generally should be <reg orig="re-|garded">regarded</reg> <lb/>
as a panorama and Mrs. <reg orig="Balling-|ton">Ballington</reg> <lb/>
Booth is seen in a succession of all sorts <lb/>
of surroundings in various countries. For two <lb/>
decades and a half the Salvation Army with its <lb/>
drums and flags has furnished a shifting <reg orig="back-|ground">background</reg> <lb/>
to her career; later this background <lb/>
merges into another setting which throws into <lb/>
possibly clearer relief the works of this woman <lb/>
with her radiant influence in our civilization.</p>
<p>Nothing in the antecedents or environment <lb/>
of Maud Charlesworth&mdash;for such was the <lb/>
maiden name of the heroine of this chapter&mdash; <lb/>
pointed to a very exceptional life for the girl; <lb/>
but the good mind she inherited and the tinge <lb/>
of foreign blood in her veins no doubt had their <lb/>
effect. Her mother mingled in her veins the <lb/>
blood of French Huguenot and Scotch Calvinist. <lb/>
Her father, however, the Reverend Samuel <lb/>
Charlesworth was altogether English by race, <lb/>
as well as a clergyman of the English Church. <lb/>
Maud's girlhood, indeed, was typically English. <lb/>
Speaking of her birthplace, her father's rectory <lb/>
in the parish of Limpsfield, Surrey, she says, in <lb/>
<pb n="223" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0264"/>
<hi rend="italic">After Prison&mdash;What?:</hi> "The pretty <reg orig="tree-|shaded">tree-shaded</reg> <lb/>
garden of Nutfield Cottage was bounded <lb/>
on one side by the quiet village churchyard and <lb/>
a little private gate opened on the path that <lb/>
led through it to the garden of Nutfield Court, <lb/>
where our special playmates lived. By <reg orig="day-|light">daylight</reg> <lb/>
one could run blithely enough between the <lb/>
old quaint head-stones, moss-covered, and other <lb/>
mounds bright with masses of blossom, when <lb/>
the breeze was playing in the trees, the lark <lb/>
singing praises from the blue sky, or the quaint <lb/>
old ivy-covered tower of the church might send <lb/>
forth its glad peal of chimes. There was so <lb/>
much of life and beauty that children could run <lb/>
or linger there with no thought of the death that <lb/>
lay still and solemn beneath the smiling flowers <lb/>
and whispering grasses. But it was a different <lb/>
thing if one walked back after nightfall, with <lb/>
senses alert to every sound, and heart beating <lb/>
fast with unknown terrors. The rustle of a <lb/>
bird in the ivy, the creaking of a dead branch, <lb/>
the flitting of a bat-wing, or a play of moonbeam <lb/>
and shadow&mdash;such things made the churchyard <lb/>
a place to be avoided, for now memory was <lb/>
vivid that it was a village of the dead."</p>
<p>The writer of this passage describes a natural <lb/>
and normal little girl as well as an English <lb/>
neighborhood. But what a comparison this <reg orig="re-|membered">remembered</reg> <lb/>
"village of the dead" was to give to <lb/>
her in later years!</p>
<p>Ten years or more before this thoughtful <lb/>
child was born in Nutfield Cottage, the <reg orig="Salva-|tion">Salvation</reg> <lb/>
Army&mdash;then called The Christian Mission <lb/>
<pb n="224" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0265"/>
&mdash;was founded. The Salvation Army began <lb/>
as a limb of English Methodism, just as that <lb/>
church itself branched off from the Church of <lb/>
England a hundred years before. The <reg orig="Salva-|tion">Salvation</reg> <lb/>
Army was organized as a result of the <reg orig="re-|ligious">religious</reg> <lb/>
ardor and energy of two English New <lb/>
Connection Methodists who married in 1855. <lb/>
The man, indeed, who adopted the title of the <lb/>
"general" of the movement, was a minister of <lb/>
the New Connection, the Reverend William <lb/>
Booth. His wife, Catherine Mumford, a <reg orig="spir-|itual">spiritual</reg> <lb/>
woman of strong character, was strangely <lb/>
well-mated with him and shared his <reg orig="determina-|tion">determination</reg> <lb/>
to use effective measures, no matter how <lb/>
unconventional, to extend the Kingdom of God <lb/>
upon earth. Squads of their Army are a <reg orig="fa-|miliar">familiar</reg> <lb/>
sight in the streets to-day. No one <reg orig="mo-|lests">molests</reg> <lb/>
them or jeers at their banner inscribed <lb/>
with "Blood and Fire." That this motto of <lb/>
theirs once expressed the open scorn and actual <lb/>
violence which they had to meet is hard to <reg orig="re-|alize">realize</reg> <lb/>
now. Not so very many years ago, <reg orig="how-|ever">however</reg>, <lb/>
both General Booth and his eloquent wife <lb/>
were arrested for commotions attending the <lb/>
open-air meetings at which they won converts, <lb/>
and their followers were often fined and <reg orig="im-|prisoned">imprisoned</reg> <lb/>
and sometimes beaten and maimed or <lb/>
killed by the rabble. Why the Salvationists <lb/>
were deemed unpardonable in the <reg orig="eighteen-|fifties">eighteen-fifties</reg> <lb/>
and sixties is easy to understand. In <lb/>
the first place, England is a quiet-loving country, <lb/>
and the eyes of authority and the people could <lb/>
see nothing but disturbance of the public peace <lb/>
<pb n="225" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0266"/>
in the acts of these modern crusaders as, on <lb/>
country commons or city streets, they collected <lb/>
crowds which often became riotous. One sort <lb/>
of popular opposition came from saloon-keepers, <lb/>
drunkards, law-breakers and bitter women <lb/>
whom the fearless, if noisy, evangelists were <lb/>
trying to convert. The more the Salvation <lb/>
Army was persecuted and prosecuted, however, <lb/>
the more people did it convert, most of them <lb/>
from the less educated classes but not a few <lb/>
persons of rank, such as Lord and Lady Cairns, <lb/>
and Sir Arthur Blackwood. Towards the end <lb/>
of her life, Queen Victoria showed toward the <lb/>
Army a less distant consideration than at first; <lb/>
and her son had long been friendly, when as <lb/>
Edward VII he invited General Booth to take <lb/>
part in his coronation in 1902.</p>
<p>A number of factors have made for the <reg orig="suc-|cess">success</reg> <lb/>
of the Salvationists in bringing thousands <lb/>
to Christianity and pure living. For one thing, <lb/>
the sect is absolutely sincere. Moreover&mdash;as was <lb/>
at first hard for the world to understand&mdash;the <lb/>
Booths did not from choice make use of <reg orig="tam-|bourines">tambourines</reg>, <lb/>
shouting, and red-scarfed parades, but <lb/>
adopted their noisy methods simply because <lb/>
they saw that in no other way could they catch <lb/>
the attention of a great mass of people. The <lb/>
Army's creed, as a matter of fact, differs from <lb/>
that of the Anglican Church simply in that the <lb/>
sacraments are not observed for fear of <reg orig="dis-|cussion">discussion</reg> <lb/>
that might prevent men and women from <lb/>
coming to Christ&mdash;the all-important matter. <lb/>
That their methods of campaign as well as its <lb/>
<pb n="226" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0267"/>
object were fully approved from on high, both <lb/>
General and Mrs. Booth firmly believed; this <lb/>
clear conception, joined to executive force and <lb/>
resourcefulness, in no small measure accounts <lb/>
for their success.</p>
<p>It would be hard to point to any other quarter <lb/>
where religion has shown such effectiveness <lb/>
since the Salvationist era. After their first <lb/>
hard conquest of British prejudice at home, <lb/>
Booth sent his captains abroad and sometimes <lb/>
went forth in person. George Scott Railton, as <lb/>
a missionary, journeyed to Morocco in 1870; and <lb/>
two years later James Jermey writes to the <reg orig="Gen-|eral">General</reg> <lb/>
from Erie Street in Cleveland, Ohio, that <lb/>
"in the good Providence of our blessed Lord <lb/>
I and family are all quite well, and at last I <lb/>
am in the right field for mission work&mdash;glory, <lb/>
hallelujah!" Detachments of the Army <reg orig="in-|vaded">invaded</reg> <lb/>
the continent; Frederick St. George de <lb/>
Latour Tucker in 1881 resigned his position as <lb/>
a high government official in the Punjab to <reg orig="be-|come">become</reg> <lb/>
the Salvation Army "Commissioner" in <lb/>
India; and soon after a party sailed over seas <lb/>
to far Australia, where the cause began to <reg orig="pros-|per">prosper</reg> <lb/>
from the first.</p>
<p>Although not formally incorporated and <lb/>
named until 1865, this "religious organization <lb/>
on military principles" more soundly dates, as <lb/>
already noted, from the marriage of its high <lb/>
priest and priestess ten years earlier. <reg orig="Defi-|nitely">Definitely</reg>, <lb/>
the activities of the Salvation crusading <lb/>
have been and still are these: the rescue of <lb/>
<pb n="227" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0268"/>
unfortunate women who are housed and cared <lb/>
for in Army "rescue homes"; the regular <reg orig="visi-|tation">visitation</reg>, <lb/>
not to say invasion, of the worst haunts <lb/>
of vice and sin, of drinking places and crowded <lb/>
tenements; the furnishing of coal, clothing, food, <lb/>
shelter, and lodging to all who need them; the <lb/>
caring for children; the visiting of prisons and <lb/>
hospitals; the providing of Christmas and <lb/>
Thanksgiving dinners; and the finding of <reg orig="em-|ployment">employment</reg> <lb/>
either inside of the Army or out of <lb/>
it for those having none. At the same time, it <lb/>
is the constant aim to bring all the men and <lb/>
women who are thus helped into the <reg orig="Salvation-|ist">Salvationist</reg> <lb/>
ranks and into a belief in the Saviour, who, <lb/>
according to the doctrine which they preach and <lb/>
practice, is to be served with utter self-<reg orig="abnega-|tion">abnegation</reg> <lb/>
and with thought only of others. The <reg orig="mili-|tary">military</reg> <lb/>
structure under which this work is carried <lb/>
on includes "corps," "regiments," and "<reg orig="out-|posts">outposts</reg>," <lb/>
and the ranks of "colonel," "<reg orig="lieutenant-|colonel">lieutenant-colonel</reg>," <lb/>
"major," "captain," and "<reg orig="lieuten-|ant">lieutenant</reg>," <lb/>
while the rank and file are called <lb/>
"cadets." The General, whose "International <lb/>
Headquarters" are in London seems always to <lb/>
have a "Commander" as his right hand there, <lb/>
a title which Mrs. Catherine Booth bore&mdash;for <lb/>
titles are held by women as well as men&mdash;until <lb/>
her death in 1890.</p>
<p>Since the death of General Booth in 1912, his <lb/>
eldest son, Bramwell Booth, has succeeded him <lb/>
as the General in London. The American <lb/>
"Headquarters" are in New York. In <reg orig="coun-|tries">countries</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="228" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0269"/>
where the Salvationist work is making its <lb/>
beginnings its head is called the "<reg orig="Commis-|sioner">Commissioner</reg>."</p>
<p>The General and Mrs. Booth had eight <reg orig="chil-|dren">children</reg>, <lb/>
who, as fast as they grew up, were created <lb/>
officers of the Army; most of them were like the <lb/>
parents, pure spirits, stern yet happy in <reg orig="self-|requirement">self-requirement</reg>, <lb/>
their life objects seeming to be <lb/>
just two&mdash;the service of their Redeemer and the <lb/>
bringing of others to that Master for their <reg orig="sav-|ing">saving</reg>. <lb/>
The Booths must be characterized as the <lb/>
hierarchy of their sect, for they are no less. <lb/>
Clearness demands a chart of the family:</p>
<figure id="f10" rend="block" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0269"/>
<p>Of the whole body of the Salvation Army, <lb/>
General Booth was the autocrat, exercising his <lb/>
authority as fully over its members who were <lb/>
also of his own family as over all the rest. His <lb/>
authority, too, seems to have been almost <reg orig="un-|limited">unlimited</reg> <lb/>
in its extent; it suggests to the <reg orig="Ameri-|can">American</reg> <lb/>
mind the complete spiritual or moral <reg orig="con-|trol">control</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="229" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0270"/>
attributed to the heads of Mormonism; <lb/>
though it must instantly be said that the <reg orig="Sal-|vationists">Salvationists</reg> <lb/>
never have had marriage latitudes as <lb/>
their dictator's rules of marriage are, on the <lb/>
contrary, very restrictive. No minute details <lb/>
of duty or the conduct of physical life seem to <lb/>
have been excepted from the direction of <reg orig="Gen-|eral">General</reg> <lb/>
Booth, and no wedding could take place <lb/>
without his permission. And the family <reg orig="ap-|pears">appears</reg> <lb/>
to have been as faithful to his religious <lb/>
dispensation as he was inflexible in enforcing <lb/>
it. That outsiders who have married into the <lb/>
family have taken its color almost completely <lb/>
shows the coherence of the family. Major <lb/>
Tucker, who married Emma Booth, not only <lb/>
merged his life into the organization, but <lb/>
legally changed his name to Booth-Tucker. So <lb/>
did Colonel Clibborn, who similarly changed <lb/>
his name when he married the eldest daughter, <lb/>
Catherine, her whom the Parisians named "La <lb/>
Mar&eacute;chale" when her father and mother sent <lb/>
her as a Salvationist Joan of Arc into France. <lb/>
But there was one spirit, and that a woman's, <lb/>
which became identified with the Booth family <lb/>
and the Army without becoming absorbed in <lb/>
them. That spirit belongs to her, born Maud <lb/>
Charlesworth, who became Mrs. Ballington <lb/>
Booth.</p>
<p>The education of Maud Charlesworth as child <lb/>
and schoolgirl went forward through the dozen <lb/>
years centered by 1875, partly in Belstead, <reg orig="Eng-|land">England</reg>, <lb/>
and partly in Switzerland, with, however, <lb/>
a good part of the time spent at home. The <lb/>
<pb n="230" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0271"/>
family moved from the pleasant rectory in <reg orig="Sur-|rey">Surrey</reg> <lb/>
into a London neighborhood where Mr. <lb/>
Charlesworth assumed the large parish of <reg orig="Lime-|house">Lime-house</reg>. <lb/>
Here she first met the Army in which <lb/>
she afterwards enlisted. In her <hi rend="italic">Beneath Two <lb/>
Flags</hi> she records that first impression: "I <lb/>
remember as well as if it were yesterday my <lb/>
first sight of the Salvation Army. It was in <lb/>
my second home, a pleasant, shady, <reg orig="country-|like">country-like</reg> <lb/>
place shut in by great high walls and gates, <lb/>
from the dust and bustle of East London, and <lb/>
on the gravel walk one bright Sunday afternoon <lb/>
knelt poorly-clad people while in their midst <lb/>
stood a man with hands uplifted in prayer. The <lb/>
crowd was augmented every moment from the <lb/>
crowded street without; poor women with <lb/>
sickly babes, lads of an unruly type, eying the <lb/>
lilacs and our windows in turn, while even <lb/>
drunken men leaned against the gate and stared <lb/>
in open-mouthed wonder. 'Strange people,' I <lb/>
thought, 'how loud they sing, and what funny <lb/>
words,' as their voices rose above the din and <lb/>
bustle in the thoroughfare without: <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>'O you must be a lover of the Lord</l>
<l>Or you can't get to heaven when you die.'</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>"Then I wondered why they knelt upon the <lb/>
hard gravel walk, and why they pleaded until <lb/>
their throats were hoarse with the crowd that <lb/>
sometimes laughed and jeered at them. The <lb/>
pathos of the speaker's voice and the tearful <lb/>
sobs of some of the witnesses could not be heard <lb/>
<pb n="231" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0272"/>
through my window and the whole scene seemed <lb/>
disjointed and grotesque compared with my <lb/>
childish experience of Sunday and religion. <lb/>
This was my first introduction to the Salvation <lb/>
Army, then known as The Christian Mission. <lb/>
'Very kind,' I had heard it said of my father, <lb/>
to let them come into our garden when through <lb/>
the influence of the saloon-keepers, the police <lb/>
had stopped them from standing in the street <lb/>
to preach to the passing multitudes.</p>
<p>"I saw them many times during the next few <lb/>
years; marching the streets through rain and <lb/>
snow, kneeling upon the hard ground, and <reg orig="sit-|ting">sitting</reg> <lb/>
crowded together in a poor, broken-down <lb/>
old theatre with the poorest and lowest of that <lb/>
large East London parish. Yes, I sometimes <lb/>
watched them, as their building stood just <reg orig="op-|posite">opposite</reg> <lb/>
our church; and strange the contrast used <lb/>
to seem when we stepped in for a few moments <lb/>
on Sunday night to listen to the merry joyful <lb/>
songs. And then I heard them sometimes when <lb/>
the singing sounded muffled through the <reg orig="stained-|glass">stained-glass</reg> <lb/>
windows of our church, and it could hardly <lb/>
have been said to break the sacred stillness yet <lb/>
I could catch the oft-repeated words, 'O you <lb/>
must be a lover of the Lord,' and sometimes <lb/>
they would come to my ears mixed in a strange <lb/>
way with that familiar sentence, 'Lord, have <lb/>
mercy upon us miserable sinners.' Ah, little <lb/>
did I know that these people were sinners <reg orig="for-|given">forgiven</reg> <lb/>
seeking sinners lost.</p>
<p>"Again as I lay at death's door with typhoid <lb/>
fever I heard the same old song echoing down <lb/>
<pb n="232" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0273"/>
the chimney sometimes varied with the refrain, <lb/>
'Will you go, will you go to the Eden above?'</p>
<p>"And many a day after that I would run to <lb/>
the window as they marched past; by degrees I <lb/>
could hear fresh choruses and see larger crowds <lb/>
until finally there appeared a flag, with a bright <lb/>
star in its red centre and a blue border <reg orig="flutter-|ing">fluttering</reg> <lb/>
in the wind. I would move from one <reg orig="win-|dow">window</reg> <lb/>
to another to keep them in view, but, after <lb/>
all, to me they were only a crowd and some <lb/>
stirring scenes.</p>
<p>"Later on my childish thoughts were <reg orig="ex-|changed">exchanged</reg> <lb/>
for other people's opinions and <reg orig="criti-|cisms">criticisms</reg>, <lb/>
until as the Army passed, with uniform <lb/>
and with colors flying, I learned to smile with <lb/>
derision, and to not only take credit, but repeat <lb/>
tales which had lost the little spark of truth with <lb/>
which they started."</p>
<p>But note the maturer attitude of the young <lb/>
girl:</p>
<p>"I turn from those days to a time when I saw <lb/>
them as rescuers of drunken fishermen in the <lb/>
streets of a seaport town famed for its <reg orig="wicked-|ness">wickedness</reg> <lb/>
and learned to know them as godly earnest <lb/>
people. Yes, it was then that my opinions <lb/>
changed and I saw them as they were and <lb/>
learned to love them; for they were pure in <lb/>
heart and filled with a love for others and <reg orig="dis-|regard">disregard</reg> <lb/>
for self that gave them a strange <reg orig="fas-|cination">fascination</reg> <lb/>
for me.</p>
<p>"But I pass to the days when I learned to <lb/>
look anxiously and lovingly through the <reg orig="rec-|tory">rectory</reg> <lb/>
windows for the approaching of their <reg orig="blue-|bordered">blue-bordered</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="233" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0274"/>
flag, until I pause at <hi rend="italic">the</hi> day when I <lb/>
myself, in the Army hall, saw Jesus my Saviour <lb/>
as I never had seen Him before, and gave up <lb/>
my life entirely to God&mdash;<hi rend="italic">my</hi> God, the Army's <lb/>
God, and the drunkard's God. There I <reg orig="re-|ceived">received</reg> <lb/>
into my heart the love and fire that sent <lb/>
me forth to do God's will and to follow the steps <lb/>
of Christ to Calvary. Indeed, I found that day <lb/>
that not only had I been looking at the Army, <lb/>
their methods and their work through a colored <lb/>
glass, but at my God&mdash;His will, His love, and <lb/>
His purposes, until they had become so dim, <lb/>
that I had never seen written across His life and <lb/>
sacrifice, <hi rend="italic">'Go thou and do likewise.'</hi> I had a <lb/>
new purpose in life, and the present, <reg orig="ever-|present">ever-present</reg> <lb/>
consciousness of my Saviour's nearness. <lb/>
Of course everything looked different then&mdash; <lb/>
the Salvationists kneeling in the muddy London <lb/>
streets, associating with drunkards and sinners, <lb/>
the poor and despised, the singing at the risk of <lb/>
throat and lungs in frosty winter air. Ay, even <lb/>
the shouting for joy&mdash;all was understood, all <lb/>
was made clear. And then my thoughts <reg orig="trav-|eled">traveled</reg> <lb/>
on through eight years of service&mdash;happy <lb/>
years in which I daily have learned to love the <lb/>
Army better, and have seen for myself what a <lb/>
blessed and wonderful power God has made <lb/>
it."</p>
<p>Many a fine-hearted, fervent young creature <lb/>
might have thrown herself into the community <lb/>
of the enthusiasts, or at least have desired to do <lb/>
so. It is doubtful whether she would have <lb/>
been permitted to do so or whether she would <lb/>
<pb n="234" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0275"/>
have remained when once enlisted in the Army. <lb/>
This school miss was barely old enough to have <lb/>
been presented at Court, yet the Reverend Mr. <lb/>
Charlesworth let his earnest little daughter <lb/>
flock with these rag-tag and bobtail Christians. <lb/>
Moreover, the girl remained steadfastly with <lb/>
them from that time forward. What decision, <lb/>
courage, character and conviction in one not <lb/>
grown to a woman! The father on his part, <lb/>
although a formalist at least in profession, was <lb/>
a gentle Christian and a good man; he perceived <lb/>
the sincerity of these children of God, and had <lb/>
let the troop of them come out of the <reg orig="inhos-|pitable">inhospitable</reg> <lb/>
street into the rectory garden. Then <lb/>
why might he not trust his child in the meetings <lb/>
and marches of these strangely holy folk if she <lb/>
really felt inspired from Heaven to go with <lb/>
them?</p>
<p>It was at this date, 1881, that the Booths sent <lb/>
their first crusade into France. Mrs. Booth <lb/>
traveled thither with the party, which she left <lb/>
there under the leadership of her daughter <lb/>
Catherine, who&mdash;think of it&mdash;had not much <lb/>
more than reached her majority. With "<reg orig="Cap-|tain">Captain</reg>" <lb/>
Catherine, went out little Miss <reg orig="Charles-|worth">Charlesworth</reg> <lb/>
as her "lieutenant." A dozen other <lb/>
maidens of similar ages made up Miss Booth's <lb/>
band, and it was now that she became the <lb/>
"Mar&eacute;chale." Something of the campaign is <lb/>
recounted by Mrs. Ballington Booth:</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">"God has left Paris</hi>, is not only a statement <lb/>
printed in large letters as a newspaper heading, <lb/>
but is regarded as an accomplished fact by those <lb/>
<pb n="235" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0276"/>
who school themselves to believe in nothing <reg orig="su-|pernatural">supernatural</reg> <lb/>
or religious. Another paper rejoices <lb/>
in the fact that the Parisians have brought <lb/>
about <hi rend="italic">'the abolition of God,'</hi> and having torn <lb/>
down His altars and banished His memory, they <lb/>
exalt the goddess of reason, the god of pleasure, <lb/>
and the mighty god of self, who only too readily <lb/>
asserts himself in every Christless heart.</p>
<p>"In a little hall, situated at the end of an <lb/>
alley, up a flight of stairs, the Army flag was <lb/>
first planted in a poor and communistic quarter. <lb/>
A strange little gathering it would have <reg orig="ap-|peared">appeared</reg> <lb/>
to a stranger unacquainted with its <lb/>
meaning. A crowd of rough French laborers, <lb/>
dressed in their blue blouses, and women in <lb/>
their little snowy-white caps, knives and pistols <lb/>
not visible, but there nevertheless, hugged close <lb/>
to the citizen's breast. A rough hard crowd, as <lb/>
the words&mdash;'They have got in that hall half <lb/>
the cut-throats of Paris'&mdash;of the sergeant of the <lb/>
police prove. O, what a study of vicious faces, <lb/>
that look ready at any moment to do or dare <lb/>
anything, and on the platform only a few young <lb/>
girls! The one who is singing, with face <reg orig="up-|lifted">uplifted</reg>, <lb/>
you might imagine to be some Catherine <lb/>
of Sienna or Madame Guyon; a sweet, holy, <lb/>
determined face, thin and worn with work, but <lb/>
full of courage and resolution. The crowds <lb/>
stare in wonder, spellbound and perplexed, as <lb/>
they listen to the simple heart-stirring song. <lb/>
Thus the Salvation Army began its work in <lb/>
France.</p>
<p>"Night after night the little band prayed, <lb/>
<pb n="236" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0277"/>
sang, and spoke, until they were weary, but <lb/>
to small effect. It seemed as though the first <lb/>
convert would never come. The people <reg orig="re-|mained">remained</reg> <lb/>
immovable, though they came in crowds. <lb/>
A French Christian who watched these strange <lb/>
movements, turning to Miss Booth said: 'You <lb/>
had better go home to your mother. The <reg orig="Sal-|vation">Salvation</reg> <lb/>
Army cannot possibly succeed here.' <lb/>
Perhaps part of this comforting advice might <lb/>
have found an outspoken echo in the heart of <lb/>
one less consecrated. But the suggestion was <lb/>
stifled by the brave answer, 'If I cannot save <lb/>
France, I can die for it,' and mother and home <lb/>
were not visited, until the visit could be taken <lb/>
with news of victory.</p>
<p>"The people wept and were deeply impressed, <lb/>
but as to definitely seeking salvation it seemed <lb/>
far from them. But one night the Captain <lb/>
made her way to the back of the hall and sat <lb/>
down to a poor, dissolute working woman; she <lb/>
put her arms around her and asked her if she <lb/>
did not want Jesus as her friend and Saviour. <lb/>
'I love you,' she said, looking into the woman's <lb/>
face, while her tears fell on the hard-worked <lb/>
hand. Those tears melted the heart which no <lb/>
amount of preaching would have broken; and <lb/>
this touch of divine love made the poor woman <lb/>
long to find its source. So before the night <lb/>
had passed the Army's first Parisian convert <lb/>
had risen from the penitent form washed in the <lb/>
precious blood of Jesus. The ice was broken <lb/>
then, and although the fight was still hard, by <lb/>
ones and twos their ranks were augmented, <reg orig="un-|til">until</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="237" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0278"/>
a nice little platform of French men and <lb/>
women could be seen nightly in the new hall <lb/>
on the Quai Valmy," to which the Mar&eacute;chale <lb/>
moved the camp when their position grew <lb/>
stronger.</p>
<p>Needless to say that the French press found <lb/>
high amusement in the enterprise of these <reg orig="pure-|faced">pure-faced</reg> <lb/>
little missionaries. Yet they did not <reg orig="al-|ways">always</reg> <lb/>
sneer, either; take, for example, the <reg orig="fol-|lowing">following</reg> <lb/>
picture by a reporter in the daily paper, <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Paris</hi>. It does not require very hard guessing <lb/>
to recognize the portrait drawn:</p>
<p>"In a caf&eacute; in the Quartier Latin, last month, <lb/>
a numerous party was assembled by the usual <lb/>
haphazard of public-houses. Drinking, <reg orig="smok-|ing">smoking</reg>, <lb/>
card-playing, singing, speech-making, and <lb/>
chatting were the order of the day.</p>
<p>"Suddenly the door opened, and after <reg orig="sev-|eral">several</reg> <lb/>
seconds of astounded silence, a clamour <lb/>
rose, tumultuous, extraordinary, formidable, <lb/>
greeting the entrance of a woman cadet of the <lb/>
Salvation Army.</p>
<p>"She was a young girl of some sixteen years, <lb/>
of the Nell Horn type. With her delicate <reg orig="pro-|file">profile</reg> <lb/>
rendered still more delicate by being <reg orig="en-|cased">encased</reg> <lb/>
in a great, black funereal bonnet, very <lb/>
pale, her eyes bright and sad, erect in her <lb/>
little old woman's dress, with a voice whose <lb/>
English accent heightened its sweetness, she <lb/>
offered the Salvation journal, <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italic">En Avant.</hi></foreign> <lb/>
They were free to buy it, or to let her return <lb/>
as she came.</p>
<p>"But one woman knew no better than to <reg orig="in-|sult">insult</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="238" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0279"/>
her pure young sister. Some men had the <lb/>
weakness to laugh at the would-be joke.</p>
<p>"The Salvationist remained untroubled. She <lb/>
invited the girl who had insulted her to 'come <lb/>
to Jesus,' and explained to her the advantages <lb/>
of conversion, paraphrasing the dictum of her <lb/>
leader, 'You make pleasure your god, make God <lb/>
your pleasure.' The assembled caf&eacute;, delighted, <lb/>
received this little sermon with redoubled <reg orig="rep-|artees">repartees</reg>, <lb/>
some few witty, many more idiotic. <lb/>
In spite of this brutal avalanche, aimed at that <lb/>
which was sacred to her, the face of the <reg orig="Salva-|tionist">Salvationist</reg> <lb/>
kept its serenity.</p>
<p>"The conflict between one little devotee of <lb/>
sixteen years and a company of some sixty men <lb/>
and women, sceptical and shameless, was <reg orig="pro-|longed">prolonged</reg>. <lb/>
At last a woman, moved by the <reg orig="spec-|tacle">spectacle</reg> <lb/>
of such strong faith, responding so bravely <lb/>
and generously to all kinds of insult, begged the <lb/>
assembly to leave off. <hi rend="italic">It was the woman who <lb/>
had begun it all!</hi></p>
<p>"This sudden change of tactics, provoked by <lb/>
an attitude more than human&mdash;heavenly&mdash;gave <lb/>
me the secret of the rapid religious growth of <lb/>
this organization. It possesses courage and <lb/>
resignation. These are the first virtues of <lb/>
apostleship, those which arouse in the masses <lb/>
admiration and pity."</p>
<p>In this other scene, intense is the interest <reg orig="be-|cause">because</reg> <lb/>
the simple Spirit of the Universe meets <lb/>
and awes the most artificialized civilization of <lb/>
mankind. That they might appeal to the <reg orig="well-|to-do">well-to-do</reg>, <lb/>
pleasure-seeking Parisian, the <reg orig="Salvation-|ists">Salvationists</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="239" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0280"/>
rented a resplendent ballroom on the <reg orig="Boule-|vard">Boulevard</reg> <lb/>
Des Capucines. The heavy velvet <reg orig="hang-|ings">hangings</reg>, <lb/>
flashing mirrors, polished floor, gilded <lb/>
furniture&mdash;what a contrast to the dingy Army <lb/>
hall down in La Villette! But more striking <lb/>
was the difference in audiences. Carriages <lb/>
crowding the boulevard without brought ladies <lb/>
clothed and bejeweled as for the opera, and <lb/>
gentlemen in evening dress. The fashionables <lb/>
of Paris filled every seat.</p>
<p>The Salvationists filed upon the platform. <lb/>
Upon the little group of plainly dressed, <reg orig="sweet-|faced">sweet-faced</reg>, <lb/>
stern lipped young women, hundreds of <lb/>
opera-glasses were focused. Sneering <reg orig="com-|ments">comments</reg> <lb/>
arose from the audience. When Miss <lb/>
Booth knelt in silent prayer, the audience arose <lb/>
as one and stared at her in amazement.</p>
<p>"Is she sick?" asked one lady.</p>
<p>"No," answered another. "She is praying <lb/>
to the good God." Exclamations of wonder <lb/>
arose.</p>
<p>"Has God left Paris?" "What is the <reg orig="re-|ligion">religion</reg> <lb/>
for France?" and "A lost soul," were <lb/>
the topics of Miss Booth's address. As she <lb/>
started to speak, her hearers took no pains to <lb/>
conceal their amused wonder. "But after a <lb/>
while," writes one who was there, "as the <lb/>
power of God could be felt through the straight <lb/>
yet tender words of the speaker, the listeners <lb/>
for once forgot themselves and were lost in the <lb/>
subject; fans would be folded, glasses forgotten, <lb/>
and the mask of outward seeming would drop, <lb/>
leaving on those faces a look of weary <reg orig="long-|ing">longing</reg>, <lb/>
<pb n="240" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0281"/>
apprehension or pain, which showed clearly <lb/>
that the heart beneath had not been quite <reg orig="dead-|ened">deadened</reg> <lb/>
by the false joy and empty etiquette of the <lb/>
Paris world."</p>
<p>In one week the cadets of the Paris Training <lb/>
Home which La Mar&eacute;chale established visited <lb/>
nine hundred and seventy-four caf&eacute;s, speaking <lb/>
and singing in most of them. "Wealthy <reg orig="mer-|chants">merchants</reg>, <lb/>
ministers of the Gospel, would-be <lb/>
suicides, drunkards, women of fashion, and <lb/>
poor, lost girls&mdash;truly all manner of men and <lb/>
women, were saved."</p>
<p>In 1883 Miss Charlesworth, now eighteen, <reg orig="re-|visited">revisited</reg> <lb/>
Switzerland, this time in company with <lb/>
her superior officer, the Mar&eacute;chale; Major <lb/>
Booth-Tucker in his engaging <hi rend="italic">Life Of Mrs. <lb/>
Catherine Booth</hi> exclaims that, "In no country <lb/>
has the Army encountered more bitter and <lb/>
persistent opposition than in the freedom-<reg orig="boast-|ing">boasting</reg> <lb/>
republic." It does seem strange, as he <lb/>
contends, that governments were so slow to <lb/>
recognize and utilize the Salvation Army, "in <lb/>
spite of its notorious success in purging and <lb/>
purifying and transforming the outcasts of <lb/>
society." In the midst of such brave <reg orig="en-|deavors">endeavors</reg>, <lb/>
Miss Booth and her companions were <lb/>
expelled from the country; but they returned, <lb/>
and in September the Mar&eacute;chale writes to her <lb/>
mother from Neuch&acirc;tel Prison. "I have a <lb/>
mattress, a blanket, and a shawl. The food is <lb/>
very decent, and the bread not hard. &hellip; This <lb/>
is all right. God is in it. If you could see our <lb/>
soldiers, and how the town is awakened, you <lb/>
<pb n="241" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0282"/>
would rejoice with me. The rulers hate Christ <lb/>
come in the flesh. But He <hi rend="italic">is</hi> come, and oh, if <lb/>
you could have seen our meetings Sunday <reg orig="after-|noon">afternoon</reg> <lb/>
in the wood. The tears, the prayers, the <lb/>
shouts!" General and Mrs. Booth in London <lb/>
urged Earl Granville and Mr. Gladstone to take <lb/>
measures for the release of the captive; La <lb/>
Mar&eacute;chale was soon free. Miss Charlesworth, <lb/>
though described as "one of the most <reg orig="coura-|geous">courageous</reg> <lb/>
and successful officers in the ranks," <lb/>
somehow escaped arrest; but a Miss Stirling <lb/>
who was with them was imprisoned for one <reg orig="hun-|dred">hundred</reg> <lb/>
days. Thereafter, however, the Swiss <reg orig="au-|thorities">authorities</reg> <lb/>
ceased to molest the Salvationists <lb/>
among them; and the adversities already <lb/>
suffered redounded to the advantage of the <reg orig="mis-|sions">missions</reg> <lb/>
on the continent generally.</p>
<p>The scene as regards Miss Charlesworth <lb/>
shifts from the Alps to Sweden. In that <reg orig="coun-|try">country</reg> <lb/>
in 1886 at the head of a party, the young <lb/>
girl is the heroine of an incident that includes a <lb/>
touch of a lady's learning, very apt in the <reg orig="uni-|versity">university</reg> <lb/>
city of Upsala. "As I went home," she <lb/>
writes, "late at night from my meeting I met <lb/>
troops of young students, many of whom were <lb/>
drunk and singing ribald songs. Passing the <lb/>
large saloons &lsqb;this word reflects the later <reg orig="Amer-|ican">American</reg> <lb/>
life&rsqb; I heard glasses clinking on the <reg orig="count-|ers">counters</reg>, <lb/>
the rolling of billiard balls, and, looking <lb/>
at the large lighted windows above, I was <lb/>
told that those who were in before eleven were <lb/>
allowed to remain all night. Further, I heard <lb/>
that these young men were the flower and hope <lb/>
<pb n="242" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0283"/>
of Sweden, for in that city there were two <lb/>
thousand college students. Had any special <lb/>
effort been made by the churches to reach them? <lb/>
I was told that they were considered <reg orig="unreach-|able">unreachable</reg>. <lb/>
We therefore determined to make an <reg orig="at-|tempt">attempt</reg> <lb/>
in this direction. To have placarded the <lb/>
city with posters in the Swedish language, <reg orig="in-|viting">inviting</reg> <lb/>
these students to our meeting, would have <lb/>
been to have brought them, insulted and <reg orig="dis-|gusted">disgusted</reg> <lb/>
to break the windows, and probably even <lb/>
to attempt to wreck the building. We <reg orig="there-|fore">therefore</reg> <lb/>
published the following bill:</p>
<p>"CIVES ACADEMICI:&mdash;CRAS, <reg orig="DOMIN-|ICA&mdash;HORA">DOMINICA&mdash;HORA</reg> <lb/>

<note id="n8" place="foot" n="8"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>Citizens of the University, come all of you to-morrow, <lb/>

through the renown of the warfare in Switzerland, will <reg orig="ad-|dress">address</reg> <lb/>
the audience. None but university students will be <lb/>
admitted to "The Ark" hall.</p></note>
</p>
<p>"What was the result? That evening the <lb/>
one topic in the saloons of the city was the <lb/>
Salvation Army's new departure. Swedes <lb/>
looked at the bill in open-mouthed wonder <lb/>
whereas the students were flattered with the <lb/>
idea of this meeting being exclusively for them, <lb/>
<pb n="243" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0284"/>
and of the Swedish populace being ignorant of <lb/>
the purport of the invitation.</p>
<p>"At three o'clock on the Sunday afternoon, <lb/>
with I must confess a little trembling and fear <lb/>
as to results, I stepped upon the platform to <lb/>
look down upon a sea of faces, for the <reg orig="news-|papers">newspapers</reg> <lb/>
estimated that out of the two thousand <lb/>
students sixteen hundred were present." Nor <lb/>
was this the only meeting, for later others as <lb/>
successful and large were held, and the interest <lb/>
and change manifested in many of those young <lb/>
men was not only an intense joy to the <reg orig="Salva-|tionists">Salvationists</reg>, <lb/>
but was also the comment of the whole <lb/>
religious and secular press of the country.</p>
<p>She returned to England, and that autumn <lb/>
married there Ballington Booth whose life was <lb/>
consecrated to the cause that claimed her every <lb/>
effort. He had just come home from the <reg orig="direc-|tion">direction</reg> <lb/>
of affairs in Australia, but in 1887 the two <lb/>
sailed to take charge of the organization in the <lb/>
United States. Few English people have ever <lb/>
understood America any better than <reg orig="Amer-|icans">Americans</reg> <lb/>
usually understand the United Kingdom, <lb/>
and General Booth's Salvation Army in <reg orig="Amer-|ica">America</reg> <lb/>
has never reached its maximum <reg orig="effective-|ness">effectiveness</reg> <lb/>
because its conduct has been too British. <lb/>
For a number of years the General had tried <lb/>
a succession of representatives, but it was hard <lb/>
for them successfully to carry out the plans <lb/>
mapped out for them by him at the far-away <lb/>
London International Headquarters. Now, <lb/>
Commander and Mrs. Ballington Booth had <lb/>
hardly more than landed in New York before <lb/>
<pb n="244" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0285"/>
the American separation began. They saw, <lb/>
two very perceptive and practical people, that <lb/>
American conditions were not met, and <reg orig="Balling-|ton">Ballington</reg> <lb/>
Booth, while faithfully preserving his <reg orig="sub-|ordination">subordination</reg>, <lb/>
endeavored to explain this state of <lb/>
things in his reports to his father. The <reg orig="Gen-|eral">General</reg>, <lb/>
however, was imperiously conservative. <lb/>
The Ballington Booths and serviceable friends <lb/>
whom they had made begged General Booth to <lb/>
come over and see the situation, and he finally <lb/>
did come, but between the father and son there <lb/>
was already a definite, if unspoken, <reg orig="disagree-|ment">disagreement</reg>; <lb/>
the old autocrat felt his junior to be <reg orig="pre-|suming">presuming</reg> <lb/>
in venturing to suggest to his authority, <lb/>
while the capable young man, eager and chafing <lb/>
to throw himself into the campaign before him, <lb/>
felt that he was restrained from successful <reg orig="ac-|tion">action</reg> <lb/>
only by the unadaptive policy of the <reg orig="dis-|tant">distant</reg> <lb/>
chief. The breach was not lessened by the <lb/>
tour that the three made of the country. The <lb/>
intelligent Commander and his interesting wife <lb/>
attracted even more attention than the <reg orig="gray-|haired">gray-haired</reg> <lb/>
founder himself&mdash;a situation <reg orig="unprece-|dented">unprecedented</reg> <lb/>
in his experience. It is impossible not <lb/>
to sympathize with the mortified veteran; all <lb/>
that he and his faithful partner, now dead, had <lb/>
originated and accomplished had rendered the <lb/>
career of Ballington possible; but it is always <lb/>
hard for the vigorous father to realize that even <lb/>
his son grows up, or to remember that the world <lb/>
is a kaleidoscope in which things readjust into <lb/>
new relations that are better seen by younger <lb/>
eyes than by those that are growing dimmer.</p>
<pb n="245" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0286"/>
<p>The Commander resigned that title; he <lb/>
ceased to have anything to do with the <reg orig="Salva-|tionists">Salvationists</reg> <lb/>
in the United States and indeed left the <lb/>
Salvation Army altogether. "Bring Maudie <lb/>
and come back," the General wrote from <reg orig="Lon-|don&mdash;he">London&mdash;he</reg> <lb/>
had returned there&mdash;but Mrs. <reg orig="Balling-|ton">Ballington</reg> <lb/>
Booth was in accord with her husband and <lb/>
the step which she saw was necessary for their <lb/>
usefulness in the United States. The break <lb/>
grew definite and final&mdash;for some years they <lb/>
had been naturalized citizens when, in 1895, <lb/>
they set on foot the Volunteers of America with <lb/>
Ballington Booth named as its General and him <lb/>
and his wife as the joint presidents. Since <lb/>
that time, Mrs. Booth has in no way been <reg orig="as-|sociated">associated</reg> <lb/>
with the Salvation Army.</p>
<p>The Volunteers of America is described as <lb/>
"a philanthropic, social and Christian <reg orig="move-|ment">movement</reg>," <lb/>
and this organization, although loosely <lb/>
modeled on the United States Army, seems less <lb/>
rigorous in its discipline than the parent <reg orig="Sal-|vationist">Salvationist</reg> <lb/>
body; in fact the Volunteers use <lb/>
civilian titles along with their military ones, as <lb/>
for instance their General and his wife are also <lb/>
the Presidents, Colonel Walter Crafts is the <lb/>
Treasurer, Colonel James W. Merrill, the <reg orig="Na-|tional">National</reg> <lb/>
Secretary, and so on. Their <reg orig="headquar-|ters">headquarters</reg> <lb/>
are in New York, and, although they have <lb/>
not branched outside of the United States, they <lb/>
are very active throughout the country in <reg orig="be-|nevolent">benevolent</reg> <lb/>
undertakings similar to those of the <lb/>
Salvation Army. Instead of a one-man r&eacute;gime, <lb/>
however, such as old General Booth held over <lb/>
<pb n="246" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0287"/>
his Army, the Volunteers' General or their two <lb/>
Presidents confer annually as to government <lb/>
with the Grand Field Council, which represents <lb/>
the minor officers throughout the country. If <lb/>
there is a material difference in the <reg orig="Volun-|teers">Volunteers</reg>' <lb/>
methods of preaching, singing, and <reg orig="con-|version">conversion</reg>, <lb/>
it is that the Volunteer corps are <reg orig="per-|haps">perhaps</reg> <lb/>
a shade quieter than the Salvationists, <lb/>
although, as well as indoor services, the <reg orig="Volun-|teers">Volunteers</reg> <lb/>
hold meetings "in God's natural <reg orig="cathe-|dral">cathedral</reg>, <lb/>
our open-air stands." The portion of <lb/>
this work that is more familiar to the public the <lb/>
General of the Volunteers administers, while <lb/>
Mrs. Booth entirely devotes herself, as her <lb/>
share of the Volunteers' undertakings, to the <lb/>
class of people, cursed by society, whom she <lb/>
has regenerated for this world and the next.</p>
<p>So this is the second background to her life&mdash; <lb/>
her Volunteer Prison League. And what shall <lb/>
we say of this background? Is not the hard <lb/>
gray stone of prison walls a dreary surface <lb/>
against which to see a gentle form? But her <lb/>
visitation has, from Sing Sing to San Quentin, <lb/>
strangely thrown a warmth over cold prison <lb/>
walls, which no longer always seem to scowl in <lb/>
the sunlight, for they now wear a brightness <lb/>
that is new to them. Can the satisfied <reg orig="im-|pulses">impulses</reg> <lb/>
of a woman's heart explain it all? This <lb/>
question, one must answer "No," and say that <lb/>
Christ has wrought the change with her as His <lb/>
means.</p>
<p>During Mrs. Ballington Booth's journeys <lb/>
with her husband before they left the <reg orig="Salva-|tion">Salvation</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="247" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0288"/>
Army, she had become deeply interested <lb/>
in prison work through her visit to San <reg orig="Quen-|tin">Quentin</reg> <lb/>
Penitentiary in California. In <reg orig="conse-|quence">consequence</reg>, <lb/>
her Volunteer Prison League was <lb/>
started at Sing Sing on May 24, 1896. The <lb/>
atmosphere of the California institution seemed <lb/>
to intimate a cessation of life; the stark cells <lb/>
impressed themselves as little else than tombs; <lb/>
they brought back to her mind the churchyard, <lb/>
that "village of the dead," lying next her home <lb/>
in childish days at English Limpsfield. "In <lb/>
those days death held over me a great horror. <lb/>
The thought connected with it that made me feel <lb/>
most desolate, and the fact that when one was <lb/>
dead, laid away in the earth and left alone in <lb/>
some dark place beneath the tree shadows, to <lb/>
be covered in by the snow or swept over by <lb/>
howling winds or dismal rains, the world would <lb/>
still go on the same as ever. For others, bright <lb/>
home lights would gleam, laughter and fun, <lb/>
companionship and love, life with all it means <lb/>
would still exist, while the dead would lie <reg orig="for-|gotten">forgotten</reg> <lb/>
and alone. I have thought of these <lb/>
things and seen once more the vivid picture <lb/>
and felt the thrill of those childish fears as I <lb/>
have entered into sympathy with the 'boys' in <lb/>
prison, for prison to many is a living death."</p>
<p>Mrs. Booth first went to Sing Sing at the <lb/>
special request of Warden Omar V. Sage. The <lb/>
invitation came from him without suggestion, <lb/>
even, from the Booths. From that day the <lb/>
work has grown, spreading from prison to <lb/>
prison and state to state, "but I have always <lb/>
<pb n="248" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0289"/>
visited each prison at the special invitation of <lb/>
chaplain or warden, never pushing in my work <lb/>
as something aside from theirs, but planning <lb/>
to go as a helper to them in their field. We <lb/>
have the strong co&ouml;peration, sympathy and <lb/>
backing of the officials all over the country." <lb/>
Major R. W. McClaughrey, formerly warden <lb/>
of the United States Penitentiary at <reg orig="Leaven-|worth">Leavenworth</reg>, <lb/>
Kansas, makes the same statement from <lb/>
the officials' point of view: "I am safe in <lb/>
saying that Mrs. Ballington Booth's influence <lb/>
in the prisons of which I have had charge, has <lb/>
been more potent than the rules and <reg orig="regula-|tions">regulations</reg>, <lb/>
formal discipline, or the 'terrors of the <lb/>
law,' in producing a spirit of loyalty, <reg orig="cheerful-|ness">cheerfulness</reg> <lb/>
and obedience that has greatly improved <lb/>
conditions in every respect. I cannot <reg orig="com-|mend">commend</reg> <lb/>
her work too highly, nor can I commend <lb/>
her too strongly as an able, devoted, and <reg orig="con-|secrated">consecrated</reg> <lb/>
Christian woman who deserves the <reg orig="con-|fidence">confidence</reg> <lb/>
and help of all lovers of God and <reg orig="human-|ity">humanity</reg>." <lb/>
Very different language this from what <lb/>
the warden might use in writing about many <lb/>
ladies who have thought themselves called to <lb/>
work among prisoners; Mrs. Ballington Booth <lb/>
has no maudlin sympathy; from the first she <lb/>
has known that though society, government and <lb/>
law may be in fault the average prisoner is also <lb/>
bad and needs reformation. Their "Little <lb/>
Mother," as they call her, goes straight for <lb/>
their hearts and souls&mdash;which she always <reg orig="as-|sumes">assumes</reg> <lb/>
they possess&mdash;and so regenerates them <lb/>
<pb n="249" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0290"/>
from the core outward to the improvement of <lb/>
their lot from the beginning and to the end.</p>
<p>As in all effort, it was the hardest thing to <lb/>
break ground. The men at her original <reg orig="meet-|ing">meeting</reg> <lb/>
with them were at first ugly, and might <lb/>
have tried to hoot her out of Sing Sing if it had <lb/>
not been for the guards. Had they not known <lb/>
men and women come to appeal to them before <lb/>
who had done them no good? Yet slowly the <lb/>
looks of the black-striped, shaven-headed <reg orig="as-|sembly">assembly</reg> <lb/>
in the chapel altered. In the words of <lb/>
Mr. Theiss: "A little woman, a queenly <lb/>
woman, sat on the platform with her hands <lb/>
folded. There were no harsh lines in her face, <lb/>
there were no marks of sternness, no <reg orig="holier-|than-thou">holier-than-thou</reg> <lb/>
expression in it. Instead there were <lb/>
understanding kindness, sympathy, love. It <lb/>
was not the face of a reformer, but of a woman; <lb/>
and the woman had rich, black hair, piled in <lb/>
shining masses on her head; with warm full <lb/>
lips, with cheeks that glowed, and with eyes so <lb/>
dark, so full, so lustrous, that they began to <lb/>
burn into the heart.</p>
<p>"With her hands folded, this unexampled <lb/>
visitor sat studying their own upturned faces. <lb/>
She saw scarred and scowling countenances that <lb/>
expressed only hatred and passion. She saw <lb/>
hardened visages in whose wistful look was a <lb/>
lingering trace of goodness. She saw still <reg orig="in-|nocent">innocent</reg> <lb/>
faces of young men who yet beheld life <lb/>
fair before them. But on every face she saw <lb/>
pain, suffering, and humiliation. And as she <lb/>
<pb n="250" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0291"/>
surveyed them the look of love deepened on <lb/>
her face, and a mist came into her eyes.</p>
<p>"When the music ceased Mrs. Booth rose <lb/>
to speak. She told her hearers of the glad <lb/>
Springtime outside, of the birds and the buds <lb/>
and the blossoms, of the beautiful sun and the <lb/>
fragrant breezes, and of all the hope and joy <lb/>
of the new year. She paused a moment to let <lb/>
her words sink in. Then she said: 'Boys, <lb/>
there's a new life for you if you if you will have it. <lb/>
The sun of God's love is shining on you just as <lb/>
truly as the sun in the skies is shining on the <lb/>
earth. Let its beams into your heart and try <lb/>
the new life that will spring up. Give up the <lb/>
old life, so full of pain and suffering, and try <lb/>
the new with its peace and joy. Now, while we <lb/>
sing softly one stanza of 'Nearer, My God, to <lb/>
Thee' I want every one who will try to lead a <lb/>
better life to stand on his feet and remain <reg orig="stand-|ing">standing</reg>.'"</p>
<p>Softly the music rose and filled the chapel, <lb/>
and died away again. Hardened faces began to <lb/>
work convulsively. Strong men bowed their <lb/>
heads and sobbed audibly. Yet no one rose. <lb/>
Coming close to the edge of the platform, the <lb/>
speaker stretched out her arms and said: "Oh, <lb/>
boys, boys, won't you come? Don't you know <lb/>
I want to help you? Don't you know I am <lb/>
your friend? If all the world turns against <lb/>
you, I will stand by you. Don't you know I <lb/>
love you?" Tears were rolling down her <lb/>
cheeks and she could control her voice no <lb/>
<pb n="251" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0292"/>
longer. But she stood with her arms <reg orig="out-|stretched">outstretched</reg> <lb/>
in silent appeal. Then an old <reg orig="con-|vict">convict</reg> <lb/>
arose, sobbing as a child. A second stood <lb/>
up. Then another and another, until <reg orig="eighty-|three">eighty-three</reg> <lb/>
men were on their feet. That afternoon <lb/>
a society of the inmates was started at their <lb/>
own suggestion; and such was the beginning <lb/>
of the Volunteer Prison League or the V. P. L.</p>
<p>Who can wonder that the genius of such a <lb/>
scene now has her famous Hope Halls, and has <lb/>
extended the membership of her League <lb/>
throughout many penal institutions, until now <lb/>
the V. P. L's number nearly ninety thousand <lb/>
members, including both those in and out of <lb/>
confinement?</p>
<p>If this is astounding, how much more so the <lb/>
fact that she is successful with about <reg orig="three-|quarters">three-quarters</reg> <lb/>
of all those League members who come <lb/>
to her care from the prison. Moreover, Mrs. <lb/>
Booth splendidly asserts, and her showings <lb/>
bear her out, that, even to begin with, "the <lb/>
prisons are not filled with degenerate, vicious, <lb/>
crime-loving men. There have been, and <reg orig="al-|ways">always</reg> <lb/>
will be as long as degenerating influences <lb/>
are at work, some abnormal and brutal <reg orig="char-|acters">characters</reg> <lb/>
whose fiendish murders, assaults, and <lb/>
schemes of robbery startle and shock the world. <lb/>
It is unjust to judge all the prison population <lb/>
by these few monsters," for of all who after <lb/>
serving their terms have trusted her and their <lb/>
higher nature she has made three-quarters <reg orig="de-|cent">decent</reg>, <lb/>
useful citizens.</p>
<pb n="252" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0293"/>
<p>In assuming Volunteer Prison League <reg orig="mem-|bership">membership</reg> <lb/>
the entrant subscribes to these simple <lb/>
rules:</p>
<p>First. To pray every morning and night.</p>
<p>Second. To read the Day Book faithfully. <lb/>
&lsqb;The Day Book is a manual of extracts from <lb/>
the Bible of a kind most helpful and cheerful <lb/>
to prisoners.&rsqb;</p>
<p>Third. To refrain from the use of bad <reg orig="lan-|guage">language</reg>, <lb/>
and abstain from the use of intoxicants.</p>
<p>Fourth. To be faithful in observance of <lb/>
prison rules and discipline, so as to become an <lb/>
example of good conduct.</p>
<p>Fifth. To seek earnestly and to encourage <lb/>
others in well-doing and right living, trying <lb/>
where it is possible to make new members <lb/>
of the League.</p>
<p>Every man who joins receives a little white <lb/>
button with the League's blue star and its <lb/>
motto, "Look up and hope." A certificate of <lb/>
membership hangs in his cell as a daily <reg orig="re-|minder">reminder</reg> <lb/>
of his promises and his happier <reg orig="out-|look">outlook</reg>. <lb/>
While the "Little Mother" does all that <lb/>
she can to win the "boys" into active <reg orig="Chris-|tianity">Christianity</reg>, <lb/>
yet any man may enter the <reg orig="organiza-|tion">organization</reg> <lb/>
who will endeavor to lead a rightful life; <lb/>
likewise any member is received with welcome <lb/>
at the nearest Hope Hall for his fresh start at <lb/>
his discharge from prison, whether he be <lb/>
Catholic or Jew, or Protestant or infidel. They <lb/>
must all, by the way, come straight to the Hope <lb/>
Hall when they are free, for their own safety. <lb/>
No individual just out of prison is immediately <lb/>
<pb n="253" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0294"/>
fit for the now strange conditions of <reg orig="independ-|ent">independent</reg> <lb/>
life; for a while he needs friendly care and <lb/>
preparation, both in mind and character, and <lb/>
commonly in health besides. Furthermore, <lb/>
one just out of prison is always a marked man, <lb/>
unfavorably so; and any observer can tell him; <lb/>
hardly any person will trust him to give him <lb/>
employment, and the police are likely to arrest <lb/>
him as suspicious. Sometimes Mrs. <reg orig="Balling-|ton">Ballington</reg> <lb/>
Booth meets with men who try to acquire <lb/>
the benefits of League membership without <lb/>
meaning to heed their obligations and amend; <lb/>
but they cannot deceive her. That her insight <lb/>
is as piercing in discovering evil as it is keen <lb/>
in reading good, must be a large factor in all <lb/>
she has accomplished. Moreover, she seems to <lb/>
have the happy faculty of turning intended <lb/>
evil into good.</p>
<p>A certain young man called one morning at <lb/>
the Volunteer headquarters and with the lively <lb/>
phrase and manners of the Bowery asked to see <lb/>
Mrs. Booth. When he was admitted to her <lb/>
Prison League office, "Well, 'Little Mother,'" <lb/>
he greeted her breezily, "I have come!" He <lb/>
explained that he had just come from "up the <lb/>
river,"&mdash;the vernacular for Sing Sing&mdash;that he <lb/>
was a thief and nothing else; he had spent as <lb/>
much time behind the bars as outside of them, <lb/>
and it was the strangest thing in the world for <lb/>
him to have come to see her. He was not even <lb/>
a member of the League, but when he was about <lb/>
to be discharged some of the V. P. L. boys got <lb/>
after him, telling him that the "Little Mother" <lb/>
<pb n="254" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0295"/>
would help him all the same, and they had <reg orig="in-|duced">induced</reg> <lb/>
him to pay this visit although at first <lb/>
indisposed to it. He was not religious; <reg orig="more-|over">moreover</reg>, <lb/>
of all things, he detested work. Yet he <lb/>
was dissatisfied with what his life had been <lb/>
and he would like to try another; but under the <lb/>
peculiar circumstances, he supposed that he <lb/>
could not be entertained as a candidate for <reg orig="as-|sistance">assistance</reg>. <lb/>
The lady answered that this was not <lb/>
at all the case, and she was very glad to see him. <lb/>
She talked with him and frightened him by <reg orig="per-|suading">persuading</reg> <lb/>
him to kneel down with her while she <lb/>
prayed for his future; then she sent him to the <lb/>
Hope Hall in the interior of the State. This <lb/>
man later made good in an honest position. <lb/>
But when Mrs. Booth told her Sing Sing friends <lb/>
of this reform, and then gave the man's name <lb/>
or nickname the corridors rumbled with the <lb/>
roaring laughter of the audience. The <reg orig="authori-|ties">authorities</reg> <lb/>
were dumfounded; one officer said: "Mrs. <lb/>
Booth, we cannot believe you have got hold of <lb/>
that man and made him do honest work. He <lb/>
was born lazy and he was the most <reg orig="accom-|plished">accomplished</reg>, <lb/>
notorious crook; he used to steal while <lb/>
he was here with us, and we had him in <reg orig="punish-|ment">punishment</reg> <lb/>
most of the time because he just would not <lb/>
work. Why, we cannot think of his having <lb/>
turned over a new leaf. I wonder how long it <lb/>
will last." It has lasted now for sixteen years, <lb/>
and he is still a faithful Christian.</p>
<p>The first of the Hope Halls was the New <lb/>
York one, "Meadowbrook," but now their <lb/>
originator has three more, one each in Illinois, <lb/>
<pb n="255" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0296"/>
in Ohio, and in Iowa; but Mrs. Booth does not <lb/>
tell the public where they are, for that would <lb/>
be indelicate to the "boys." There is a <lb/>
nobility in the situation of those who go to <lb/>
these homes to complete the conquest of their <lb/>
old lower selves, and no sight-seers are <reg orig="ad-|mitted">admitted</reg> <lb/>
to the Halls. They are large houses in <lb/>
the country, with farm land around them, and <lb/>
in them the late prisoners live pleasantly and in <lb/>
comfort, working lightly but with ample time <lb/>
for reading and letter writing and <reg orig="companion-|ship">companionship</reg>. <lb/>
Whether it takes only a few days or <lb/>
takes long months, a permanent position and <lb/>
opportunity is found at last for every comer, <lb/>
and he goes forth to it well prepared to do <lb/>
right. But the Hope Halls are not all, either. <lb/>
Many prisoners have families they leave in <lb/>
want, and the V. P. L. workers look after <reg orig="num-|bers">numbers</reg> <lb/>
of these where they live; but some of them, <lb/>
wives, mothers, children, and old fathers, have <lb/>
nowhere to live, and so Mrs. Booth has built <lb/>
another hall for them. She will not whisper <lb/>
where it is to ordinary sinners, but its name is <lb/>
"Rainbow House," and it must have the <reg orig="bright-|est">brightest</reg> <lb/>
rooms, for it has many windows.</p>
<p>In the volumes which Mrs. Booth somehow <lb/>
has found time to write, there is plenty of <reg orig="evi-|dence">evidence</reg> <lb/>
that she shares her family's literary gift. <lb/>
Her sister, Mrs. Charles W. Barclay, is the <lb/>
author of <hi rend="italic">The Rosary</hi> and an aunt, Miss Maria <lb/>
Louisa Charlesworth, wrote <hi rend="italic">Ministering <reg orig="Chil-|dren">Children</reg></hi>, <lb/>
well known to the last generation. In <lb/>
Mrs. Booth's books, the reader sometimes <lb/>
<pb n="256" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0297"/>
meets with little intellectual discussions and <lb/>
spiritual matters such as were heard from her <lb/>
father's pulpit; but most of her pages are <reg orig="de-|voted">devoted</reg> <lb/>
to things most easily understood. <hi rend="italic"><reg orig="Be-|neath">Beneath</reg> <lb/>
Two Flags</hi> is unlike "Ouida's" <hi rend="italic">Under <lb/>
Two Flags. Branded</hi> and <hi rend="italic">After Prison&mdash; <lb/>
What?</hi> relate obviously to their author's chosen <lb/>
field, and so do her <hi rend="italic">Wanted&mdash;Antiseptic <reg orig="Chris-|tians">Christians</reg></hi> <lb/>
and <hi rend="italic">Little Mother Stories</hi>. It seems that <lb/>
Mrs. Booth's <hi rend="italic">Twilight Fairy Tales</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Sleepy <lb/>
Time Stories</hi> have been favorites with children, <lb/>
her own and others. Perhaps she has never <lb/>
written with more weight than in the <reg orig="follow-|ing">following</reg> <lb/>
sentences:</p>
<p>"A learned writer some years ago published <lb/>
in one of our scientific papers a treatise <reg orig="con-|cerning">concerning</reg> <lb/>
prisoners, in which he proved from his <lb/>
own mental conclusions that they could not be <lb/>
reformed. &hellip; To my surprise I was met at cell <lb/>
after cell with the question, 'Have you read, <lb/>
Little Mother, what Professor <gap desc="long dash" reason="missing" id="g3"/> said about <lb/>
us?' and in some instances, by educated and <lb/>
sceptical men, it was used as an argument <lb/>
against the duty of trying to do better. If <lb/>
those who toll the bell of doom for the poor <lb/>
souls in bondage fully realized how the <reg orig="damn-|ing">damning</reg> <lb/>
tones echo and re-echo in disheartening <lb/>
vibration from prison to prison, from cell to <lb/>
cell, they might understand that it is almost <lb/>
criminal to break the bruised reed and quench <lb/>
the smoking flax."</p>
<p>And probably nothing in Mrs. Booth's life is <lb/>
more gratifying to her than this,&mdash;that years <lb/>
<pb n="257" entity="Foster_HeroinesofModernReligion_0298"/>
after they are making a successful living and <lb/>
have happy homes of their own, many of the <lb/>
old residents come back on holidays to their <lb/>
Hope Halls to hold reunions there. What <lb/>
must they think of her?</p>
