<p><hi rend="small-caps">Work</hi> is a necessity of healthful and enjoyable <lb/>
life. Idle people, drones, exist; they do not <lb/>
live. Work, real work, work in which there <lb/>
is a purpose, and which is undertaken with <lb/>
hearty good-will, is ever laden with blessing; and even if <lb/>
the desired end be not attained, if there be honesty and <lb/>
good intention in the work, there will ever be a reward. <lb/>
Birth, position, and inherited possessions have <reg orig="unques-|tioned">unquestioned</reg> <lb/>
advantages; but they do not compensate for the <lb/>
good which is the result of labour. If health is desired, <lb/>
work is the price to be paid for the precious blessing. <lb/>
Work is the key by which knowledge is obtained; without <lb/>
labour the ignorant must remain ignorant. A royal or <lb/>
labourless road to knowledge has not yet been discovered. <lb/>
So far as intellectual attainments are concerned, the old <lb/>
axiom is true, "Without pains no gains." There is no <lb/>
law or condition so certain as that immunity from the <lb/>
necessity of labour&mdash;if life is to be noble and have a noble <lb/>
ending&mdash;cannot be obtained. Every "thing of beauty," <lb/>
convenience, and use which has come from the hands of <lb/>
<pb n="iv" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0011"/>
man, is the result and product of labour. The world's art <lb/>
treasures,&mdash;the magnificent paintings, the almost <reg orig="breath-|ing">breathing</reg> <lb/>
sculpture, the pride and boast of kingdoms; the <reg orig="litera-|ture">literature</reg> <lb/>
which enriches all time; the numberless comforts and <lb/>
conveniences which fill our cities, towns, and dwellings; <lb/>
the many physical blessings which are the results of science, <lb/>
teaching, and patient discoveries,&mdash;are all the result of <lb/>
labour. The dreamer may have dreamt of these many <lb/>
wonders: the worker thinks, and then fashions and <reg orig="pro-|duces">produces</reg>.</p>
<p>The unchanging law of labour is not less a law in relation <lb/>
to the affections than to material things. The Author of <lb/>
our existence has wisely purposed and arranged the <reg orig="condi-|tions">conditions</reg> <lb/>
of a glad and happy life, in which labour&mdash;labour of <lb/>
the head and hands&mdash;is a necessity. It is true that large <lb/>
sums of money may be bestowed on charitable objects, and <lb/>
that money thus spent may prove a blessing; but the <lb/>
donor cannot realize the thrill of joy, the heartfelt <reg orig="happi-|ness">happiness</reg> <lb/>
which accompany and reward personal service, <reg orig="sym-|pathy">sympathy</reg>, <lb/>
and loving-kindness. John Pounds attained the <lb/>
highest reward when he taught the poor children that ran <lb/>
around his stall as he sat mending shoes. Many a serious <lb/>
and devout young woman, having charge of a "class" in <lb/>
one of the many Sunday schools in Lancashire, forgets her <lb/>
own fatigues in the factory while ministering to her scholars <lb/>
in words of homely, heart-felt wisdom. She has found, as <lb/>
so many have found, that duty is the door to happiness; <lb/>
that without a strict regard to duty, no human being <lb/>
ever has obtained, or ever will obtain, peace and life-long <lb/>
happiness.</p>
<pb n="v" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0012"/>
<p>Fortunately there is a noble army of workers, especially <lb/>
noble women doing noble work, aiding the sorrowful <reg orig="wher-|ever">wherever</reg> <lb/>
sorrow and want are found. The heroines of duty are <lb/>
of all conditions and of all times and nations. The lowliest <lb/>
have often been the most earnest, sympathetic workers in <lb/>
the field of doing good; while crowns and coronets have <reg orig="ac-|quired">acquired</reg> <lb/>
a lustre from deeds of goodness and loving-kindness <lb/>
which the most precious and glittering stones would fail <lb/>
to impart. This loving nature, however, which partakes <lb/>
so much of the angelic, is perhaps as frequently found <lb/>
surrounded by poverty and privation as by wealth and <lb/>
luxury. Happily, however, the cup of cold water, the <lb/>
mite in the Temple, when prompted by willing and loving <lb/>
hearts, are remembered and accepted by our heavenly <lb/>
Father as though the gifts were as costly as the price of a <lb/>
kingdom. "Doing what she could," is all the service <reg orig="de-|manded">demanded</reg>: <lb/>
this service may be, and often is, rendered in the <lb/>
quiet and secluded places of the earth, which no eye sees <lb/>
save that all-seeing Eye which "seeth in secret."</p>
<p>Many a desponding sister, broken and dispirited by <lb/>
disappointments and adversity, soured and imbittered by <lb/>
false friendships and wrecked hopes, has found a new <reg orig="exist-|ence">existence</reg>, <lb/>
joy, and happiness in a devoted life of helpful <reg orig="ser-|vice">service</reg>. <lb/>
To go into the low-down places of poverty, to <reg orig="com-|fort">comfort</reg> <lb/>
the mourner and to bring solace to the broken heart, <lb/>
to prompt to endeavour and a new life the sin-stricken <lb/>
and the seared, to raise by gentle and winning steps the <lb/>
ignorant and the lost, is a work which is twice blessed, <lb/>
"blessing him that gives and him that takes." In <reg orig="bless-|ings">blessings</reg> <lb/>
and freely dispensed gifts the heart of the donor is <lb/>
<pb n="vi" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0013"/>
lightened, the pathway of promise is attained. Then it <lb/>
is seen that the law, "Give, and it shall be given thee <lb/>
again," is of never - failing hope, comfort, and <reg orig="endur-|ance">endurance</reg>.</p>
<p>The object of the following pages is to give a glimpse of <lb/>
the lives of those who, doing the Master's will, have spent <lb/>
their days in helping and aiding poverty and distress&mdash;in <lb/>
making the world brighter by their smiles and richer by <lb/>
their deeds. The relation may stimulate some desponding, <lb/>
inactive sister to enter upon noble work, which may be <lb/>
the precursor and earnest of a <hi rend="small-caps">noble life.</hi></p>

<l>"Oh, what makes woman lovely? Virtue, faith,</l>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">What</hi> is woman's work, and what is woman's <lb/>
sphere? Questions which have sought <lb/>
for solution in social science conferences, <lb/>
at the hands of political economists, and <lb/>
from those who make the amelioration of humanity <lb/>
the main purpose and object of life. Many, varied, <lb/>
and vexed, have been the answers. Some would <lb/>
have women confined to home and home duties, to <lb/>
stand at a distance and survey with admiration and <lb/>
respect the labours of thought and mental creation <lb/>
in which the opposite sex are engaged; others, <reg orig="per-|haps">perhaps</reg> <lb/>
even more unreasonably, demand for women <lb/>
employment in labours which command the <reg orig="absorp-|tion">absorption</reg> <lb/>
of the keenest masculine intellects&mdash;science, art, <lb/>
and literature&mdash;and that no labour which is done by <lb/>
men should be shut out or closed from women. All, <lb/>
<pb n="10" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0017"/>
however, will admit that woman is in her true sphere, <lb/>
about her own work, when ministering to the <reg orig="sorrow-|ing">sorrowing</reg> <lb/>
and ameliorating suffering:&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"'Tis thine to curb the passions' maddening sway,</l>
<l>And wipe the mourner's bitter tear away;</l>
<l>'Tis thine to soothe, when hope itself has fled,</l>
<l>And cheer with angel smile the sufferer's bed,&mdash;</l>
<l>To give to earth its charm, to life its zest;</l>
<l>One only task&mdash;to bless, and to be blest."</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>It will be a profitable task to chronicle the deeds <lb/>
of the noble women who have enriched the roll of <lb/>
female worthies&mdash;not confined to any single sphere <lb/>
of exertion, not limited to social duties, to <reg orig="minister-|ing">ministering</reg> <lb/>
in kindly acts, however humane and excellent, <lb/>
however approved by the Universal Parent, but by <lb/>
works which some think to be beyond their sphere <lb/>
and beyond their capacity or capability. There is <lb/>
scarcely a walk in life, however abstruse and <reg orig="absorb-|ing">absorbing</reg>, <lb/>
that has not been adorned by a woman, who has <lb/>
made for herself a niche and a place from which she <lb/>
luminously shines as a star of the first magnitude. <lb/>
A modern author has said: "When the <hi rend="italic">men</hi> of Israel <lb/>
bowed in helplessness before Pharaoh, two <hi rend="italic">women</hi> <lb/>
spurned his edicts and refused his behests. A <hi rend="italic">father</hi> <lb/>
made no effort to save the infant Moses, but a <hi rend="italic">mother's</hi> <lb/>
care hid him while concealment was possible, and a <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">sister</hi> watched over his preservation when exposed <lb/>
on the river's brink. To <hi rend="italic">woman</hi> was intrusted the <lb/>
charge of providing for the perils and wants of the <lb/>
wilderness; and in the hour of triumph <hi rend="italic">woman's</hi> <lb/>
<pb n="11" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0018"/>
voice was loudest in the acclaim of joy that ascended <lb/>
to heaven from an emancipated nation."</p>
<p>The history of woman is the history of power and <lb/>
influence; the history of achievements in art, in <lb/>
science, and in the subtilties of literature, which <lb/>
probe the abysses of human nature, and which are <lb/>
ever on the side of truth, purpose, and morality. <lb/>
Women have sat upon the thrones of nations, and <lb/>
their names are treasured and their deeds <reg orig="remem-|bered">remembered</reg>. <lb/>
Women have made the heavens their study, <lb/>
and the field of astronomy has become enlarged; the <lb/>
most abstruse science, mathematics, has not been <lb/>
uninvaded by woman's patient and enduring pursuit; <lb/>
while chemistry, demanding absorbed attention, has <lb/>
had its successful female votaries, who give promise, <lb/>
as opportunity is afforded in the universities and <lb/>
the large educational institutions of the kingdom, to <lb/>
equal, if not to rival, the most successful students in <lb/>
a field of study generally supposed to be uncongenial <lb/>
to the tastes and inclinations of women. In that <lb/>
region of art which Sir Joshua Reynolds designates <lb/>
as "the condition of work," women have been found <lb/>
not less painstaking, not less persevering, than the <lb/>
most laborious art-students. The result has been <lb/>
achievements which have not been surpassed, in some <lb/>
instances which have not been equalled, by the most <lb/>
eminent living artists of any time or country. In <lb/>
literature, from time immemorial, woman has made <lb/>
her impress, which will ever remain indelible. There <lb/>
<pb n="12" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0019"/>
is no field of fiction or of fact that has not had a <lb/>
gifted female interpreter. The driest and most <reg orig="un-|interesting">uninteresting</reg> <lb/>
sources of history have been patiently <lb/>
investigated, carefully compared, and reproduced with <lb/>
charming freshness. Scenes and incidents have been <lb/>
made to live over again, and become re-enacted in a <lb/>
living, breathing page, which has derived its <reg orig="absorb-|ing">absorbing</reg> <lb/>
fascination from its author rather than from the <lb/>
incident or scene which it depicted. Even political <lb/>
economy, the science of public life, has had its female <lb/>
exponents, who have won for it, dry and <reg orig="uninterest-|ing">uninteresting</reg> <lb/>
as it is generally considered, the attention and <lb/>
interest which is commanded by the best modern <lb/>
fictions. In medicine and surgery, the preparation <lb/>
for which involves inquiries which are repellent to <lb/>
fine and delicate temperaments, women have <reg orig="suc-|ceeded">succeeded</reg> <lb/>
to the astonishment of their teachers, and, <lb/>
what is more to the purpose, to the advantage of the <lb/>
public, in whose interest the studies were undertaken. <lb/>
Only by persevering determination have women been <lb/>
enabled to overcome the hostility with which they <lb/>
were met at the commencement of their medical <lb/>
studies. Judging from the past, women are capable <lb/>
of making great exertions and achieving important <lb/>
results, when female medical studies are aided instead <lb/>
of hindered by the forms and rules of medical schools.</p>
<p>But in employments even more uncongenial&mdash;in <lb/>
personally directing the slaughter of human beings, <lb/>
for war can only be so described&mdash;women have <reg orig="mani-|fested">manifested</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="13" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0020"/>
a heroism and a prowess which have elevated <lb/>
her, in what is called the science of war, to a foremost <lb/>
place among the warriors of any time. We may <lb/>
well believe that the roar of cannon and the horrible <lb/>
carnage of the battle-field are opposed to the instincts <lb/>
of women; but when duty calls&mdash;when liberty is at <lb/>
stake, when the dearest ties of humanity are <reg orig="threat-|ened">threatened</reg>, <lb/>
then women, forgetting the tenderness of their <lb/>
nature, can be found sufficiently valorous to oppose <lb/>
the thrust of bayonets and the clash of swords by <lb/>
their unyielding though weak bodies. Not often, <lb/>
it is true, are women thus called upon to ignore <lb/>
their natures: the page of history, however, bears <lb/>
witness to their willingness to make the sacrifice <lb/>
when honour and liberty are placed in jeopardy; and <lb/>
when so urged and emboldened by the highest <reg orig="incen-|tives">incentives</reg> <lb/>
of humanity, the most courageous and heroic <lb/>
have not outstripped them in personal daring and <lb/>
self-sacrifice. By an effort of the will they seem to <lb/>
have had the power to strip themselves of the <reg orig="tender-|ness">tenderness</reg> <lb/>
and gentleness of their nature, and to draw the <lb/>
sword in the cause of liberty with a firm and <reg orig="unfal-|tering">unfaltering</reg> <lb/>
hand&mdash;to scale ramparts from whence death <lb/>
has been hurled from hundreds of brazen throats, <lb/>
regardless of danger, absorbed only in the thought of <lb/>
victory and liberty.</p>
<p>It seems strange to make such an assertion, but <lb/>
men have not the heroism of women. They have <lb/>
the power and the will to sacrifice themselves in <lb/>
<pb n="14" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0021"/>
defence of home and of country; but they cannot <lb/>
equal women in the continuous struggle for <reg orig="exist-|ence">existence</reg>, <lb/>
in patient perseverance, in wearying <reg orig="under-|paid">underpaid</reg> <lb/>
labour. While man, deprived of heart or hope, <lb/>
would pine and die, woman would hold on, live on, <lb/>
buoyed up with the consciousness that to die in <lb/>
despair is no part or portion of her duty. Let her <lb/>
be necessitated to rise long before the dawn, to work <lb/>
through all the hours of the day far into the night, <lb/>
yet she ever holds on to heart and hope, comforting <lb/>
herself with the assurance that "God is good; he <lb/>
knows what is best for her, and in his own good <lb/>
time will send her aid and help." Patience and <reg orig="per-|severance">perseverance</reg> <lb/>
under wearying and saddening conditions <lb/>
seem specially to be woman's possession. Daring <lb/>
and waiting find in her a fitting and congenial home. <lb/>
And if there be some helpless child or aged parent <lb/>
depending upon the produce of her needle, how <reg orig="obli-|vious">oblivious</reg> <lb/>
of self becomes the mother or daughter: her <lb/>
joy is complete when her "work" secures them from <lb/>
privation and sorrow. Exceptions there may be, and <lb/>
it would be strange if it were not so; but the noble <lb/>
female heart, given to man as a stimulus and an <lb/>
encouragement, in the main is true to its instincts&mdash; <lb/>
true to the promptings which induced women to be <lb/>
"last at the cross and first at the sepulchre."</p>
<p>Many a man who has attained the height of his <lb/>
worldly ambition, who has fought poverty and iron <lb/>
difficulty, ascending the ladder of success by slow <lb/>
<pb n="15" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0022"/>
degrees, eating the bread of carefulness, working and <lb/>
watching from early morn to dewy eve, not suffering <lb/>
disappointment to overcome, or the want of success <lb/>
to stay him, owes his prosperity to the <reg orig="encourage-|ment">encouragement</reg> <lb/>
and confidence imparted by his wife, to the <lb/>
solicitude and cheering promptings of a dear sister <lb/>
or a loved mother. Many of the greatest names in <lb/>
literature owe their greatness to home promptings <lb/>
and female influence; without <hi rend="italic">that</hi>, many eminent <lb/>
men would have been wanting in exertion and effort, <lb/>
and the goal would not have been won. In the past <lb/>
and in the future there have been and will be <reg orig="thou-|sands">thousands</reg> <lb/>
of industrious youths in the universities who <lb/>
owe their studious perseverance to the remembrance <lb/>
of the anxious interest of a loving sister and devoted <lb/>
mother. Not to disappoint <hi rend="italic">them</hi>, no pains are too <lb/>
painful, no lengthened hours too long; and when <lb/>
the well-earned prize, which marked and chronicled <lb/>
progress, has been gained, the most delightful <reg orig="feel-|ings">feelings</reg> <lb/>
have been generated and associated with the <lb/>
joy and happiness which the success would impart <lb/>
to those at home; how the news would be received <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">there</hi>, was the absorbing and delightful thought. <lb/>
And when the vacation permitted home to be visited, <lb/>
the warm embrace of a sister and a proud mother <lb/>
has compensated tenfold for the weariness and <reg orig="exer-|tion">exertion</reg> <lb/>
which accompany mental labour. And when a <lb/>
youth so loved and cared for comes in contact with <lb/>
the temptations and allurements of the world, as <lb/>
<pb n="16" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0023"/>
come he will, what restraint so effective, so <reg orig="power-|ful">powerful</reg> <lb/>
and repellent, as the remembrance of a loved sister <lb/>
and fond mother? Meanness, and the grosser forms <lb/>
of sin, in such moments have lost their influence: <lb/>
the youth, for the time, is lifted into a higher <reg orig="atmo-|sphere">atmosphere</reg> <lb/>
of being; and in the noble purpose and high <lb/>
incentive which result from a repelled temptation, <lb/>
strength is gained for future conquests and <reg orig="resist-|ance">resistance</reg> <lb/>
to evil.</p>
<p>Female influence was surely the best portion, as it <lb/>
is truly the noblest part of a woman's nature, when <lb/>
she was created to be man's helpmate. To help him <lb/>
to overcome evil, to subdue the baser and fouler part <lb/>
of his nature, and to rise to the higher altitude of <lb/>
honour, honesty, and unblemished purity, is the task <lb/>
given her to do; and when that obligation has been <lb/>
observed, faithfully and perseveringly regarded, moral <lb/>
wonders, moral miracles have ever followed. No <lb/>
natures have been found too rough, too low, or so <lb/>
utterly debased as to be beyond the influence of the <lb/>
gentle words of woman. Her help thus given has <lb/>
saved many an outcast from despair, has lifted many <lb/>
a life from a pit of sensuality and foulness to <reg orig="hope-|ful">hopeful</reg> <lb/>
usefulness and spiritual blessedness. And when <lb/>
such an one gains the regions of eternal day, the <lb/>
crown of rejoicing and the crown of reward will <lb/>
grace the brow, as peace and joy fill the heart, of <lb/>
one of the helps that God created for man,&mdash;some <lb/>
dear, patient, persevering woman.</p>
<pb n="17" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0024"/>
<p>Everywhere is the opportunity for woman's work. <lb/>
Her companionship is not less needed amid the <reg orig="in-|hospitable">inhospitable</reg> <lb/>
arctic regions than in the torrid zone. <lb/>
Wherever human beings exist, wherever they suffer <lb/>
and are sorrowful, wherever "pain and anguish wring <lb/>
the brow," wherever service needs to be rendered and <lb/>
aid and help to be given, there woman is in her place <lb/>
and about her proper work. Whatever tasks she <lb/>
may undertake, and however efficient she may <reg orig="be-|come">become</reg> <lb/>
in the various callings to which she is <reg orig="establish-|ing">establishing</reg> <lb/>
her claim by efficiency and capacity, she must <lb/>
never forget, if there were any possibility of <reg orig="for-|getting">forgetting</reg>, <lb/>
that she was intended to be man's <reg orig="help-|mate">helpmate</reg>; <lb/>
and that without her, as the completion of his <lb/>
nature, he is denied the most elevating and <reg orig="humaniz-|ing">humanizing</reg> <lb/>
power. Women, therefore, have not work to <lb/>
seek; it is ready everywhere, ready to their hands. <lb/>
They have but to put forth the effort to try, and, be <lb/>
they where they may, the opportunity for work will <lb/>
be found; and honest, prayerful, and determined <lb/>
work will have its reward, in the accomplishment of <lb/>
a purpose which has its end and aim in making some <lb/>
home brighter, some torn and saddened life the <lb/>
happier; in the best and most possible imitation of <lb/>
the Saviour&mdash;going about in a world of sin and <lb/>
sorrow, doing good.</p>
<p>The example of the Saviour, going about "doing <lb/>
good," is not less an enforced duty than it is a <reg orig="privi-|lege">privilege</reg>. <lb/>
No man or woman lives, or attempts to live, <lb/>
<pb n="18" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0025"/>
the life which Christ left as an example without <lb/>
"doing good." Christianity is positive, it has a <reg orig="pur-|pose">purpose</reg> <lb/>
and a work. It does not and cannot rest at <lb/>
home with folded hands, with a satisfied and quiet <lb/>
contentment. The Christian is ever, in the only <lb/>
possible imitation of Christ, "about his Father's <lb/>
work." Just as it is natural for the child to run <lb/>
and jump, in answer to the law of its being, so <lb/>
Christian men and women, with the law of Christ <lb/>
in their hearts, find an unbounded impulse, a strong, <lb/>
earnest desire and incentive to work in the Saviour's <lb/>
kingdom,&mdash;to call sinners to repentance, to heal the <lb/>
broken-hearted, to comfort the sorrowing, to aid and <lb/>
help those stricken with poverty and distress, and <lb/>
to be almoners, helpers, and co-workers with the <lb/>
Saviour in mitigating woe, sorrow, and suffering. <lb/>
But this life of active service is no privation&mdash;it <lb/>
does not entail loss. On the contrary, those who <lb/>
have nobly entered upon the work have found a <lb/>
"heaven begun below." God has given and <reg orig="appro-|priated">appropriated</reg> <lb/>
a reward to the performance of every duty <lb/>
and good action. The woman who has even once, in <lb/>
imitation of the Saviour, done good, gone in a pure <lb/>
spirit, with child-like motives, has found in the <lb/>
luxury of the work joy and happiness of which <lb/>
she had no previous conception, and to which <reg orig="sensu-|ous">sensuous</reg> <lb/>
pleasures can bear no comparison. God has thus <lb/>
not left himself without witness. Evil deeds do <lb/>
not more surely deaden and defile the spiritual nature <lb/>
<pb n="19" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0026"/>
than good deeds elevate, ennoble, and bring into <reg orig="har-|mony">harmony</reg> <lb/>
with its Creator every throb and pulsation of <lb/>
the human heart; and when that glorious affinity <lb/>
and communion is enjoyed, when the creature is at <lb/>
one with the Creator, the most delightful existence <lb/>
is commenced, a store of happiness is enjoyed which <lb/>
is only a foretaste of the happiness reserved for the <lb/>
enjoyment of an endless eternity. To be upon "the <lb/>
Lord's side," then, in doing good, is to partake of the <lb/>
joys and felicities of angels;&mdash;not merely to avoid <lb/>
the miseries of a wasted, a purposeless, and a useless <lb/>
life, but to enter upon the rest and the assured <reg orig="de-|pendence">dependence</reg> <lb/>
of children held and supported by the hand <lb/>
of the heavenly Father. To such a state and <reg orig="condi-|tion">condition</reg> <lb/>
what are all the joys of sense&mdash;the mere <reg orig="plea-|sures">pleasures</reg> <lb/>
of fashion and of form? Do they, or can they, <lb/>
bear any comparison to the quiet and assured <reg orig="happi-|ness">happiness</reg> <lb/>
which results from "going about doing good"? <lb/>
The spiritual nature which God has bestowed upon <lb/>
every human being demands congenial employments. <lb/>
Ornament, indolence, and the mere frippery of <reg orig="exist-|ence">existence</reg>, <lb/>
are not the needful requirements of that nature <lb/>
which was breathed into man by the Almighty. <lb/>
The service of the Saviour, therefore, without <reg orig="entail-|ing">entailing</reg> <lb/>
one moody and gloomy deed, is full of joy <reg orig="be-|cause">because</reg> <lb/>
in harmony with the purposes and intentions <lb/>
of the Creator. To live thus&mdash;to live an unselfish <lb/>
and useful life&mdash;is to obtain all the joy of which <lb/>
human nature is capable and God intended for the <lb/>
<pb n="20" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0027"/>
happiness of his children. Need we say more to <reg orig="in-|duce">induce</reg> <lb/>
thought and earnestness in the consideration of <lb/>
duty, of God's commands, and of woman's <reg orig="opportuni-|ties">opportunities</reg> <lb/>
and privileges? Let but the life be ruled, <lb/>
guided, and directed by the one principle,&mdash;"going <lb/>
about doing good," and the smile of Jehovah will <lb/>
rest in the heart, and make life a willing, a <reg orig="continu-|ous">continuous</reg>, <lb/>
and a joyous service of song.</p>

To follow him, she spent herself in activity; she <lb/>

other loving words Miss Nightingale spoke of her <lb/>
friend and fellow-labourer, Agnes Elizabeth Jones, <lb/>
whose body was full of light, whose spirit thrilled in <lb/>
the presence of human suffering, and whose cultured <lb/>
mind spent its best energies in devising schemes to <lb/>
<pb n="22" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0029"/>
ameliorate the ills and evils of the sad and <reg orig="sorrow-|ing">sorrowing</reg> <lb/>
dwellers in the hospital and the workhouse. <lb/>
Workers, earnest workers, there have been in the wards <lb/>
of the hospitals of all countries, who dared danger <lb/>
and disease in the endeavour to ameliorate human <lb/>
suffering; but it was left to Miss Agnes Jones to <lb/>
spend her last years in tending paupers, ministering <lb/>
to their ease, and providing all aids and helps for <lb/>
their comfort. It was no easy task. She had <reg orig="pre-|judice">prejudice</reg> <lb/>
to overcome; a prejudiced vestry to convert <lb/>
to the strange doctrine that it was economy&mdash;a <lb/>
means of saving parish money&mdash;to make the lives of <lb/>
paupers happy. She had to convince the Poor Law <lb/>
Board that innovations which entirely swept away <lb/>
old customs and usages were in the interest of the <lb/>
ratepayer. She did this completely. She conciliated <lb/>
and won over adverse opinions from all sorts of men. <lb/>
Creeds and religious differences found in her a <reg orig="com-|mon">common</reg> <lb/>
centre of harmony. In good-will and <reg orig="good-|doing">good-doing</reg> <lb/>
she was ever an active exponent and example. <lb/>
She lived the life of the Saviour, and earnestly "went <lb/>
about doing good."</p>
<p>Agnes Elizabeth Jones was born in Cambridge on <lb/>
the 10th of November 1832. Her father was <reg orig="lieu-|tenant-colonel">lieutenant-colonel</reg> <lb/>
of the 12th Regiment. At her birth <lb/>
little hope was entertained of her possessing a <reg orig="vigor-|ous">vigorous</reg> <lb/>
constitution; on the contrary, she was not <reg orig="ex-|pected">expected</reg> <lb/>
to live, and was immediately baptized, in <lb/>
anticipation of her death. Contrary to all <reg orig="expecta-|tion">expectation</reg>, <lb/>
<pb n="23" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0030"/>
however, she survived many infantile illnesses; <lb/>
and when two years old was taken to Ireland, the <lb/>
native country of her parents, where she seemed to <lb/>
overcome the natural weakness of her youth, and <lb/>
become vigorous and healthy. In 1837 she <reg orig="accom-|panied">accompanied</reg> <lb/>
her father and his regiment to Mauritius, <lb/>
where six happy years were spent in that beautiful <lb/>
country. Here it was she first felt an interest in <lb/>
the sufferings of the Madagascar Christians, some <lb/>
of whom had taken refuge in Mauritius, and had <lb/>
excited in her the greatest interest. The work <lb/>
that then seemed to her best worth doing was <reg orig="mis-|sionary">missionary</reg> <lb/>
work. From her seventh year this idea took <lb/>
possession of her mind; and although she did not <lb/>
visit distant countries to carry the gospel&mdash;the glad <lb/>
tidings of a risen Saviour&mdash;she was not less a <reg orig="mis-|sionary">missionary</reg> <lb/>
because her message was delivered at home; <lb/>
her life was not less a sacrifice because spent near <lb/>
her friends and in the midst of a great town.</p>
<p>Owing to the illness of her father the family <reg orig="re-|turned">returned</reg> <lb/>
to England in 1843, and from the same cause <lb/>
he soon after left the army. Her mother, who <lb/>
had suffered much from the climate of Mauritius, <lb/>
also returned an invalid, which necessitated that the <lb/>
education of Miss Jones and her sister should be <lb/>
committed to the care of teachers&mdash;a duty which, up <lb/>
to that time, had been efficiently performed by her. <lb/>
At this time the family lived at Fahan House, <reg orig="beau-|tifully">beautifully</reg> <lb/>
situated on the banks of Lough Swilly, to <lb/>
<pb n="24" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0031"/>
which Miss Jones became much attached. She was <lb/>
not, however, at this period very happy; singular <lb/>
to say, her capabilities in acquiring knowledge were <lb/>
not very great, which occasioned much sorrow to her <lb/>
sensitive nature.</p>
<p>In the year 1848, Miss Jones and her sister were <lb/>
sent to Miss Ainsworth's school at Avonbank, <reg orig="Strat-|ford-on-Avon">Stratford-on-Avon</reg>, <lb/>
where, owing to the admirable system <lb/>
and cheerfulness which prevailed at the school, she <lb/>
quickly improved, and became remarkable for <reg orig="ear-|nest">earnest</reg> <lb/>
application to her studies and corresponding <reg orig="im-|provement">improvement</reg>. <lb/>
After two years spent in the school, <lb/>
the sisters were summoned home by the illness of <lb/>
their father;&mdash;a few hours before their arrival he had <lb/>
taken his departure to his everlasting home. The <lb/>
death of her dear father much affected Miss Jones; <lb/>
and from the period of his death her character <reg orig="be-|came">became</reg> <lb/>
more subdued and serious. Her mother, sister, <lb/>
and brother, became the objects of attentive, watchful <lb/>
care. It was observed, when the family went to <reg orig="re-|side">reside</reg> <lb/>
in Dublin, that Agnes had then only one <reg orig="plea-|surable">pleasurable</reg> <lb/>
employment&mdash;ministering to the needy, the <lb/>
poor and ignorant, with whom she came in contact. <lb/>
Her own studies included a preparation for an <reg orig="ex-|amination">examination</reg> <lb/>
in the contents of Bacon's "Essays" and <lb/>
Butler's "Analogy," and lessons in German and <lb/>
drawing. She was always busy, always had a task <lb/>
on hand. Her labours, however, with the exception <lb/>
of her own education, were always undertaken for <lb/>
<pb n="25" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0032"/>
friends or the poor. She was incapable of a selfish <lb/>
act or a selfish thought. This induced her, in <reg orig="seek-|ing">seeking</reg> <lb/>
opportunities of usefulness, to begin classes in <lb/>
the Lurgan Street Ragged School, the physical and <lb/>
spiritual wants of the children having called out her <lb/>
deepest sympathetic feelings.</p>
<p>In 1853 the family started for a six months' tour <lb/>
in France, Germany, and Switzerland, during which <lb/>
Agnes was ever anxious to gain information of the <lb/>
habits and customs of the people. When in Paris she <lb/>
went with her mother and sister to a meeting of the <lb/>
&OElig;uvre des Diaconesses, and was much interested in <lb/>
the reports of the labours of the sisters, and no doubt <lb/>
mentally determined that her life also should be <reg orig="de-|voted">devoted</reg> <lb/>
to the purposes and blessings of charity. At <lb/>
Bonn the family spent some time, and took the <lb/>
opportunity to visit the celebrated Kaiserswerth <reg orig="in-|stitution">institution</reg>, <lb/>
the various departments of which much <lb/>
interested her. A few days afterwards it was <reg orig="ar-|ranged">arranged</reg> <lb/>
that, in order the better to understand the <lb/>
working of the institution, she should spend a week <lb/>
there. That week had an immense influence in <reg orig="de-|termining">determining</reg> <lb/>
her future occupation. During the week <lb/>
she lived the life and joined in the labours of the <lb/>
deaconesses. Rising at six to breakfast and retiring <lb/>
to bed at ten, every intervening hour was fully and <lb/>
usefully employed. All were busy, yet there was no <lb/>
bustle. This week's work made a solemn and a deep <lb/>
impression upon her. She saw, or thought she saw, <lb/>
<pb n="26" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0033"/>
the direction in which it was God's purpose she <lb/>
should be employed. When the family returned to <lb/>
Ireland, she commenced more earnestly than before <lb/>
to put into operation and to realize the life of service <lb/>
she had planned. In the school, with the sick at <lb/>
their bed-sides, or with the poor in their cottages, <lb/>
she was now always about her Master's work, "doing <lb/>
good." To be with the poor, to help the poor, was to <lb/>
her heartfelt enjoyment. Every morning she "set <lb/>
on" her rounds of usefulness, returning to an early <lb/>
dinner, only to commence, immediately after, another <lb/>
round of visits, which would not close until the <lb/>
evening. No weather deterred her, no distance <lb/>
where she felt she could be of use was too great, and <lb/>
no road too long or lonely. Frequently in the winter <lb/>
she would come from these visits of mercy, her cloak <lb/>
stiff with ice and her hands benumbed with cold. <lb/>
For five years at Fahan she continued these works of <lb/>
mercy and good-doing. She acquired, by study and <lb/>
practice, great and confident skill in prescribing for <lb/>
the sick and in dressing wounds, which caused her to <lb/>
be sought by the poor people residing many miles <lb/>
across the mountains. Roman Catholics and <reg orig="Protes-|tants">Protestants</reg> <lb/>
were all treated alike. She would admit no <lb/>
creed in suffering. Her journal recording these visits <lb/>
is full of thankfulness and trust, with notices of <lb/>
happy and mournful incidents, and showing above <lb/>
all her dependence upon the help and sustaining arm <lb/>
of the Saviour. She was not, however, unmindful of <lb/>
<pb n="27" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0034"/>
the duties of her home. When the servants were not <lb/>
sufficiently skilful, she would spend hours in the <lb/>
kitchen preparing pastry; she would frequently rise <lb/>
at five in the morning, so that when her mother came <lb/>
from her room all would be prepared for the morning <lb/>
meal. To save her mother from trouble and to <reg orig="anti-|cipate">anticipate</reg> <lb/>
her every wish, was not less a duty than a <lb/>
delight.</p>
<p>In the year 1860, seven years after her first week <lb/>
at Kaiserswerth, it was resolved that Miss Jones <lb/>
should pay her second and long-promised visit to the <lb/>
institution. Her uncle was going to Germany, and <lb/>
he therefore became her escort. Her intention was <lb/>
to be away six or seven weeks, and to learn while at <lb/>
the hospital much more than she knew, to assist her <lb/>
in her ministrations to the poor. That was what <lb/>
Agnes proposed. Her heavenly Father, however, led <lb/>
her to devote her life to other scenes of usefulness, so <lb/>
that she never again returned home except for a <lb/>
passing visit. Her going even for the limited period <lb/>
intended was a source of much sorrow. To leave the <lb/>
sick and the poor whom she had so long cared for, <lb/>
was to her tender and compassionate nature <reg orig="exceed-|ingly">exceedingly</reg> <lb/>
painful. Her journal tells of the active life she <lb/>
led while at Kaiserswerth, the devotion to duty, and <lb/>
the growth of the spiritual life, which entirely <reg orig="sub-|dued">subdued</reg> <lb/>
self in the love she had for the service of the <lb/>
Saviour; or, as she wrote in her journal: "To hold <lb/>
ourselves ever in readiness to serve Him; to think <lb/>
<pb n="28" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0035"/>
nothing too small, and so we shall be ready for <lb/>
greater works and further submission, if he sees fit <lb/>
to call us to any great work." "Enable me to grow <lb/>
in the knowledge of what may help others, but, <lb/>
above all, in the knowledge of thee, my Saviour, from <lb/>
whom comes the will to work for thee."</p>
<p>Pastor Fliedner, the head of the institution, who <lb/>
had in twenty-four years established upwards of <lb/>
fifty hospitals, and trained two hundred and fifty <lb/>
deaconesses, and had under his direction four <reg orig="hun-|dred">hundred</reg> <lb/>
novices, was a confirmed victim of consumption. <lb/>
He was unable to do any public work, yet he could <lb/>
and did make his life useful by private conversations <lb/>
with the deaconesses, and by writing books and letters. <lb/>
In a conversation with the good pastor, Miss Jones <lb/>
was induced to prolong her stay at the hospital <reg orig="be-|yond">beyond</reg> <lb/>
the time she had purposed. If it was worth <lb/>
while to learn the system and routine of the hospital, <lb/>
it was worth while learning it thoroughly. The most <lb/>
valuable lesson, however, which Miss Jones acquired <lb/>
at Kaiserswerth was that of <hi rend="italic">implicit obedience</hi>. It <lb/>
has been frequently observed that the German nurses <lb/>
are specially noticeable for a cheerful spirit of <reg orig="self-|denial">self-denial</reg>, <lb/>
submission, and helpful service. Agnes <reg orig="under-|took">undertook</reg> <lb/>
at the hospital continuous and taxing labours. <lb/>
Work, however, done in the eye of the Master was <lb/>
cheerfully done. If the work or task benefited the <lb/>
sick, the weary, or the afflicted, that was sufficient <lb/>
reward All the time, however, she was at <reg orig="Kaisers-|werth">Kaiserswerth</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="29" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0036"/>
her heart was at Fahan with her mother and <lb/>
sister; but she had learned to give up desires and <lb/>
personal pleasures to the call of her heavenly Father; <lb/>
&mdash;duty, that which ought to be done, that she would <lb/>
cheerfully do.</p>
<p>From her journal we learn that her labours in the <lb/>
hospital were real and hard enough:&mdash;" Up at five, <lb/>
dress, make bed, sweep room, and read till a quarter <lb/>
past six; breakfast and prayers; go to hospital at <lb/>
seven; give children cod-liver oil and other medicines; <lb/>
then begins the washing and dressing till half-past <lb/>
eight, children's luncheon; then there are several <lb/>
that must be fed, mending to be done, etc.; ten to <lb/>
eleven, English class; eleven, children's dinner, and <lb/>
after it is over, and faces and hands washed, our own <lb/>
dinner comes; then I take the children a walk till <lb/>
two, children's coffee, etc.; half-past three to four, the <lb/>
'Stille Stunde' in the church; four, medicines given; <lb/>
five, undressing and washing of children for bed; <lb/>
seven, supper; some evenings I have the charge of <lb/>
the hospital till half-past nine." Yet Miss Jones <lb/>
describes these continuous labours as "a happy life" <lb/>
and the source of "continuous blessings." When, <lb/>
however, she was placed in the responsible position <lb/>
of superintendent of the boys' hospital, she found, as <lb/>
she said, "it is not so easy as one would think to be <lb/>
a superintendent." Many were her trials, which she <lb/>
met bravely and courageously. Sometimes a spirit <lb/>
of repining came over her, as when she wrote: "<reg orig="To-|day">Today</reg>, <lb/>
<pb n="30" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0037"/>
when out walking, I could only keep from <lb/>
crying by running races with my boys." "I fear I <lb/>
offered myself thoughtlessly for a work I am not <lb/>
qualified for; however, it is well to find out my <reg orig="defi-|ciency">deficiency</reg> <lb/>
in time." There was no repining on account <lb/>
of the amount of work or the character of the work <lb/>
which had to be done. The heartiness and devotion <lb/>
which she brought to her tasks would almost seem to <lb/>
have rendered menial drudgery a pleasure. "The <lb/>
cleaning and keeping my dominion in order," she <lb/>
wrote, "is such a business. Sweeping and washing <lb/>
the floor of the three rooms every morning; two <lb/>
stoves, which must be black-leaded weekly, each <lb/>
taking an hour; weekly cleaning of windows, tins, <lb/>
dinner chest, washing of bandages, etc., besides the <lb/>
washing up after each of our five meals,&mdash;keeps one <lb/>
busy." Her own meals did not trouble her much, <lb/>
contrasted as they must have been with the neatness <lb/>
and order of her mother's table,&mdash;a soup-plate of <lb/>
vegetables with a bit of meat on the top, sent up <lb/>
with the children's porringers, served on a cloth that <lb/>
was only changed once in seven days! And yet she <lb/>
acknowledged herself as being "never better or <reg orig="hap-|pier">happier</reg>." <lb/>
She felt that she had found her true work, <lb/>
and was happy in the performance of the task. The <lb/>
work opened up and developed power of which she <lb/>
was not previously conscious. One day at <reg orig="Kaisers-|werth">Kaiserswerth</reg> <lb/>
an operation had to be performed on a baby <lb/>
for a hare lip. The deaconess in charge turned pale <lb/>
<pb n="31" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0038"/>
when asked to hold the child; Agnes, however, <lb/>
quietly came forward and asked to be allowed to <lb/>
take him. "No," said the doctor, "you would faint; <lb/>
a trembling hand or momentary faintness might be <lb/>
serious." To which Agnes answered, "Do try me; <lb/>
there is no one else." The doctor, seeing marks of <lb/>
firmness, let her <hi rend="italic">try;</hi> and while holding the little <lb/>
sufferer she exhibited no wavering or weakness. <lb/>
But when the operation was over she indulged in "a <lb/>
good cry." Often afterwards was she called upon to <lb/>
witness suffering, and to offer consolatory words in <lb/>
moments of agony.</p>
<p>After leaving Kaiserswerth she spent a few weeks <lb/>
in London with Mrs. Ranyard in the Bible Mission <lb/>
work, content to be useful and content to wait until <lb/>
her heavenly Father opened up the work he would <lb/>
have her to do. "I want a life-work," she wrote, "to <lb/>
employ the faculties which God has given me: they <lb/>
are not many or great mentally, but they are his gift, <lb/>
and I desire to devote them to his service." In the <lb/>
meantime she employed herself in preparing a public <lb/>
dormitory in London, which was opened by Lord <lb/>
Shaftesbury on the 5th June 1861; in holding <lb/>
mothers' meetings in various districts; and in <reg orig="inter-|views">interviews</reg> <lb/>
with Bible-women. In her visits to the sick <lb/>
poor she found wondrous instances of love for the <lb/>
Saviour amidst much suffering and many trials. No <lb/>
wonder, with her sympathetic spirit, that she should <lb/>
write to her friends, "I do so enjoy my work;" and <lb/>
<pb n="32" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0039"/>
that work was to use every available moment in <lb/>
mothers' meetings, in destitute children's schools, in <lb/>
providing homes for servants out of situations, and <lb/>
in conversation with those whom she could profit and <lb/>
encourage. The work she did in London&mdash;so <reg orig="sympa-|thetic">sympathetic</reg> <lb/>
and so true to the purposes and intentions of <lb/>
her devoted life&mdash;was sufficient to ennoble her name <lb/>
and call forth blessings from the hundreds who felt <lb/>
her aid and help. "One day," she said, "I opened a <lb/>
door to see, as I thought, a corpse on the bed before <lb/>
me. Horror-struck, I closed it on that chamber of <lb/>
death, but felt, as it were, forced into the room and <lb/>
down on my knees beside the bed. I prayed, and <lb/>
the eyes of the seeming corpse opened. 'Who are <lb/>
you? who sent you here with those words for me?' <lb/>
Oh, it was because Christ would have that soul with <lb/>
him for ever." Many similar glad experiences Agnes <lb/>
heard from the devoted band of Bible-women, who <lb/>
could tell of works of mercy done by the Saviour <lb/>
through their instrumentality that must have <reg orig="glad-|dened">gladdened</reg> <lb/>
angels.</p>
<p>After a brief visit to her mother's home at Fahan <lb/>
&mdash;for now her home was wherever sorrow and <reg orig="suffer-|ing">suffering</reg> <lb/>
were to be found&mdash;she returned to her London <lb/>
work. Would that her strength had been <reg orig="propor-|tioned">proportioned</reg> <lb/>
to her desires and her self-adopted duties! <lb/>
Pains in the head, a depressing consciousness of <lb/>
debility, convinced her friends that her labours were <lb/>
greater than she could bear. A visit to dear friends <lb/>
<pb n="33" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0040"/>
at Highfield, with the soothing quiet of the country, <lb/>
partially restored her, so that she was soon enabled <lb/>
to return to her busy life of usefulness. Scarcely had <lb/>
she recommenced her labours before she was <reg orig="sum-|moned">summoned</reg> <lb/>
to the bed-side of her sister, who lay ill of a <lb/>
fever in Rome, the family having proceeded to Italy <lb/>
some time previously. A telegram&mdash;"We wish you <lb/>
to come at once"&mdash;urged her instant departure. <lb/>
Starting alone upon so long a journey might well <lb/>
have cowed the spirit of one more physically strong; <lb/>
but at the call of duty and affection Agnes had no <lb/>
fears. She trusted in God, who had "crowned her <lb/>
with tender mercies and loving kindness." When in <lb/>
Rome, and her dear sister was slowly recovering, she <lb/>
looked a little about her. Rome had, however, upon <lb/>
her a depressing effect; she wrote of it as "this <reg orig="dis-|mal">dismal</reg>, <lb/>
dreary Rome&mdash;so utterly given to idolatry." <lb/>
She was not insensible to the immortal works of art <lb/>
by which the city is filled; but these she had known <lb/>
through copies. Her loved patients&mdash;for there were <lb/>
two now&mdash;were delightedly interested with her <lb/>
accounts of her rambles to the Colosseum, and her <lb/>
explorations of ruins and tombs and temples. Few <lb/>
ladies ever saw and ponderingly observed more in <lb/>
that wonderful city. When her sisters could go <lb/>
about they found her familiar with all the great <lb/>
pictures of the famous artists, and that she could at <lb/>
once point out the paintings worth seeing.</p>
<p>When the family left Rome for Florence, Agnes <lb/>
<pb n="34" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0041"/>
had the pleasure to meet Rosa and Francesco Madiai, <lb/>
two Kaiserswerth deaconesses, who had recently been <lb/>
established in the town; then, allowing her relatives <lb/>
to go on to Paris, where she intended to rejoin them, <lb/>
she started for Switzerland to visit several deaconess <lb/>
institutions. One of her companions on the journey <lb/>
wrote: "Agnes was the most agreeable and the most <lb/>
useful fellow-traveller I ever met; she knew or <lb/>
found out all that was necessary for travellers to <lb/>
know, and while others were discussing she had all <lb/>
arranged." Her journey included visits to St. Loup, <lb/>
a deaconess institution near Lausanne; Riehen, <lb/>
Zurich, Mulhans, Strassburg, and M&auml;nnedorf, where, <lb/>
at the latter place, she made the acquaintance of <lb/>
Dorothea Trudel, of whose remarkable faith and <lb/>
prayer she ever spoke with the deepest admiration. <lb/>
This journey had the effect of deeply impressing her <lb/>
with the duty of devoting her life to nursing work. <lb/>
Many were ready to take up and prosecute Bible <lb/>
mission work; few had nerve, strength, or inclination <lb/>
to bury themselves in the wards of an hospital. The <lb/>
result of a correspondence with Miss Nightingale and <lb/>
Mrs. Wardroper was that she entered St. Thomas's <lb/>
Hospital as a "Nightingale probationer." <reg orig="Com-|pletely">Completely</reg> <lb/>
as her experience had capacitated her for <lb/>
discharging the duties of a nurse, yet she would <reg orig="not-|withstanding">notwithstanding</reg> <lb/>
go through the routine of professional <lb/>
training in order that she might properly acquire the <lb/>
"art" of nursing&mdash;for so the good Miss Nightingale <lb/>
<pb n="35" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0042"/>
properly designates it. Pastor Fliedner had said <lb/>
with reference to mission work: "Any one with an <lb/>
earnest Christian spirit could help there; in hospital <lb/>
work there must be a special faculty." And then, <lb/>
too, as she said, "Riehen and Zurich taught me how <lb/>
God can make feeble women strong in such work&mdash; <lb/>
can teach even weak ones, who seem so clinging as to <lb/>
need support, to stand and give guidance and help to <lb/>
others;" and adding, in a true spirit: "If every one <lb/>
shrinks back because incompetent, who will ever do <lb/>
anything? Lord, here am I; send me."</p>
<p>The time spent in St. Thomas's Hospital was not <lb/>
more valuable to herself than to the nurses, servants, <lb/>
and patients; the latter soon learning to make the <lb/>
request, "When you have time, will you come and <lb/>
talk a little?" The children were induced to learn <lb/>
hymns, and others were taught to read. But the <lb/>
hospital duties were sufficiently severe to absorb <lb/>
nearly all her time and energy. "It was quite a <lb/>
novelty," she wrote, "to sleep last night&mdash;my first <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">night</hi> in bed for six weeks." On the occasion of a <lb/>
brief visit to some friends at Barnet, she wrote:&mdash; <lb/>
"I am so amused sometimes at some such common <lb/>
things seeming so pleasant; last night getting into <lb/>
bed to feel soft, fine sheets. I never thought before <lb/>
what coarse ones I have lately been sleeping in. But <lb/>
I cannot tell you the delight of Mrs. P<gap desc="long dash" reason="missing" id="g1"/>'s <reg orig="morn-|ing">morning</reg> <lb/>
and evening kiss; it makes me think of mother, <lb/>
my own darling mother." With all these tender <lb/>
<pb n="36" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0043"/>
social sympathies, Agnes could voluntarily return <lb/>
cheerfully to her duty at the hospital. And yet the <lb/>
trial at times must have been severe. Speaking of <lb/>
her visit to Barnet, she said: "It is really next best <lb/>
to going home: when that comes near, I think I shall <lb/>
be almost crazy with delight." But "my work," as <lb/>
she called her hospital duties, and the devotion and <lb/>
sacrifice of her life, were not to be set aside for the <lb/>
sake of ease and personal comfort. She did not so <lb/>
understand the commands of her Saviour; she had <lb/>
to be about her Master's work. Well might she <reg orig="re-|peat">repeat</reg> <lb/>
with the heavenly-minded George Herbert,&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l rend="indent">"My joy, my life, my crown!</l>
<l rend="indent">My heart was meaning all the day</l>
<l rend="indent">Something it fain would say;</l>
<l rend="indent">And still it runneth muttering up and down</l>
<l>With only this&mdash;<hi rend="italic">My joy, my life, my crown!"</hi></l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>A Bible class, established by Agnes for the benefit <lb/>
of the Nightingale nurses, was the source of much <lb/>
good; so that when the time came for leaving the <lb/>
hospital, the regret was not only for herself but for <lb/>
the absence of the opportunities of profiting by her <lb/>
friendly and pleasant teaching. "It was," as the <lb/>
nurses expressed their feelings, "such a help; how <lb/>
could they do without it?" It is not difficult to see <lb/>
how, in a life of so much usefulness, joy and <reg orig="happi-|ness">happiness</reg> <lb/>
should be experienced. Agnes uttered words <lb/>
of true wisdom when she wrote,&mdash; "Home, position, <lb/>
society, and the refinements of life are pleasures; but <lb/>
where one has <hi rend="italic">work</hi>, they are not necessaries." She <lb/>
<pb n="37" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0044"/>
might have added, that home, position, society, without <lb/>
work, pall upon the true spirit, so that life becomes a <lb/>
sad weariness in mere existence, without the <reg orig="health-|ful">healthful</reg> <lb/>
stimulus of useful work, making some one better <lb/>
and some one happier:&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"Something attempted, something done</l>
<l rend="indent">To earn a night's repose."</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>When the year at St. Thomas's Hospital was ended, <lb/>
she was induced to take charge, as superintendent, <lb/>
of the small hospital in Bolsover Street; and then, <lb/>
at a subsequent period, to exchange this charge for <lb/>
the Great Northern Hospital. From the latter <reg orig="in-|stitution">institution</reg> <lb/>
she wrote:&mdash;"I am very happy among my <lb/>
patients, and often feel God has sent me here. I <lb/>
have two revival patients: one had found peace <lb/>
before she came, the other is seeking it; and to both <lb/>
I can talk. Then I have a poor woman with cancer, <lb/>
who likes me to speak of Jesus, whom I believe she <lb/>
truly loves. So you see I am not without work. <lb/>
Two operation cases have much occupied me, as I <lb/>
have all the nursing to do at present; so few patients <lb/>
making it unnecessary to have more assistance than <lb/>
a servant can give." She wrote on another day:&mdash; <lb/>
"My poor little boy of seven, whose leg was <reg orig="ampu-|tated">amputated</reg> <lb/>
on Wednesday, requires much care day and <lb/>
night, though he is doing beautifully: another <reg orig="opera-|tion">operation</reg> <lb/>
case, and ten more or less anxious medical ones." <lb/>
One particularly critical case she could trust no one <lb/>
to watch but herself, and for six weeks was seldom <lb/>
<pb n="38" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0045"/>
absent from the patient, night or day. This <reg orig="con-|tinuous">continuous</reg> <lb/>
watching produced its natural consequence <lb/>
upon her own health&mdash;she became pale and thin, and <lb/>
a slight deafness, from which she had previously <reg orig="suf-|fered">suffered</reg>, <lb/>
was increased. Immediate and perfect rest <lb/>
was seen to be at once necessary; but as a successor <lb/>
had to be provided, she was kept in London until her <lb/>
condition, physical and mental, seriously alarmed her <lb/>
relatives on arriving at home at Fahan. A few <lb/>
weeks at Port Ballintray, near the Giant's Causeway, <lb/>
speedily brought her round again. Then, after <reg orig="spend-|ing">spending</reg> <lb/>
the winter at Fahan, she prepared to enter upon <lb/>
her last work, at the Liverpool Workhouse. She <lb/>
was never more to return to her much-loved home, <lb/>
never more to visit the scenes where her spirit had <lb/>
been so much refreshed, never more to see the poor <lb/>
people who had learned to love her for her work's <lb/>
sake. Three short years would now only elapse ere <lb/>
her dear remains would be lovingly borne to the <lb/>
churchyard, and placed in her father's grave. But <lb/>
before that sad event work had to be done.</p>
<p>It was at the suggestion of Mr. W. Rathbone that the <lb/>
pauper nurses of the Liverpool Workhouse were <reg orig="sub-|stituted">substituted</reg> <lb/>
by trained paid nurses, he undertaking for <lb/>
three years to defray the cost. When consent had <lb/>
been obtained, he wrote to Miss Jones, with a <reg orig="pro-|posal">proposal</reg> <lb/>
that she should become the superintendent. <lb/>
Miss Nightingale arranged for twelve of the <reg orig="Night-|ingale">Nightingale</reg> <lb/>
nurses from St. Thomas's Hospital to form the <lb/>
<pb n="39" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0046"/>
first staff. It certainly was not without much <reg orig="deli-|beration">deliberation</reg> <lb/>
and much prayer that Agnes accepted the <lb/>
important trust&mdash;the more important as it was an <lb/>
experiment. On visiting the workhouse to consult <lb/>
with the committee, she wrote:&mdash;"I went to bed &lsqb;in <lb/>
the workhouse&rsqb; very happy, and with a kind of <reg orig="feel-|ing">feeling</reg> <lb/>
that I had indeed adopted the work: whatever <lb/>
doubts I might have had before, seeing the place has <lb/>
made me feel I shall love it, and be of use, I trust, if <lb/>
God blesses and helps me, to some of those poor lonely <lb/>
ones." For three years, with scarcely a pause, <reg orig="trust-|ing">trusting</reg> <lb/>
in God for help, she laboured with the zeal of a <lb/>
true worker. What that labour was, what it <reg orig="in-|volved">involved</reg>, <lb/>
how much mental and physical exertion it <lb/>
necessitated, none can know that have not had <reg orig="ex-|perience">experience</reg> <lb/>
in tending the most depraved poor in <reg orig="revolt-|ing">revolting</reg> <lb/>
cases of disease. On entering upon the work, <lb/>
however, she did not depend upon her own strength: <lb/>
she put herself into the hands of God for support <lb/>
and direction. The hymn which she committed to <lb/>
memory admirably expressed her heartfelt trust and <lb/>
hope:&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="stanza">
<l>"I know not the way I am going,</l>
<l rend="indent">But well do I know my Guide;</l>
<l>With a child-like trust I give my hand</l>
<l rend="indent">To the mighty Friend by my side.</l>
<l>The only thing I can say to him,</l>
<l rend="indent">As he takes it, is, 'Hold it fast;</l>
<l>Suffer me not to lose my way,</l>
<l rend="indent">And bring me home at last.'</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>"As when some helpless wanderer,</l>
<l rend="indent">Alone in an unknown land,</l>
<pb n="40" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0047"/>
<l>Tells the guide his place of rest,</l>
<l rend="indent">And leaves all else in his hand;</l>
<l>'Tis home, 'tis home that we wish to reach,</l>
<l rend="indent">He who guides us may choose the way;</l>
<l>Little we heed the path we take,</l>
<l rend="indent">If nearer home each day."</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>The work had not long commenced before the <lb/>
most pleasurable results were experienced. One poor <lb/>
woman was heard to say, how nicely her husband <lb/>
was getting on, and how comfortable everything was <lb/>
since the London nurses came. The little boys, too, <lb/>
who had often been maltreated by the attendants, <lb/>
were now so happy. A word from the "lady <reg orig="super-|intendent">superintendent</reg>," <lb/>
and the six hundred patients became <lb/>
docile and obedient. But this result was not obtained <lb/>
without immense exhaustion on the part of Agnes. <lb/>
The labours she undertook voluntarily would have <lb/>
tried the powers of the strongest man. At half-past <lb/>
five A.M. she went in her dressing-gown to unlock <lb/>
the doors for the kitchen women. At six she rang <lb/>
the bell for the nurses and probationers. At <reg orig="half-|past">half-past</reg> <lb/>
six all assembled for prayers in the nurses' <reg orig="sit-|ting-room">sitting-room</reg>. <lb/>
At seven the breakfast began. Often <lb/>
she made a round of the wards at six, and if there <lb/>
were any anxious cases, she would be up two or three <lb/>
times in the night. After "a race round the wards, <lb/>
to see that all the breakfasts are correct," she came <lb/>
to her own at the head of the table, where nurses, <lb/>
probationers, assistants, and scourers were seated. <lb/>
At half-past seven she gave the orders for the day, <lb/>
<pb n="41" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0048"/>
and then made another round of the wards. Then <lb/>
giving out stores occupied her until twelve, when the <lb/>
first dinner began. She carved for and dined with <lb/>
the nurses and probationers. Visiting patients, giving <lb/>
out stores, and attending calls innumerable, occupied <lb/>
the afternoon. After tea at four she returned to the <lb/>
wards, to superintend the dressing of patients. At <lb/>
nine she visited the wards to see that all the night <lb/>
nurses were on duty. Prayers at half-past nine. <lb/>
After this another round of the wards; and not until <lb/>
eleven could she retire to her own room, and feel <lb/>
that the work of the day was done. But there was <lb/>
no repining; on the contrary, happiness and joy in <lb/>
the consciousness of a useful life. She was not <reg orig="satis-|fied">satisfied</reg>, <lb/>
however, with merely attending to the bodies of <lb/>
those under her care. She knew there were interests <lb/>
only bounded by eternity, and that to heal and save <lb/>
the soul was of far more importance than ministering <lb/>
to the body. Very soon after her settlement in the <lb/>
workhouse she commenced Sunday evening readings <lb/>
in one of the wards where there were none but <reg orig="Pro-|testants">Protestants</reg>; <lb/>
Roman Catholics, however, without <reg orig="invita-|tion">invitation</reg>, <lb/>
attended, and were allowed to remain. Her <lb/>
sister says:&mdash;"I shall never forget the reading at <lb/>
which I was present. We came into the ward where <lb/>
about twenty patients were in bed, a few minutes <lb/>
before the appointed hour. Agnes passed at once to <lb/>
her seat at the top of the room, and sat quietly <reg orig="read-|ing">reading</reg> <lb/>
her Bible until the clock struck. In the <reg orig="mean-|time">meantime</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="42" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0049"/>
the room had filled; on each bed men were <lb/>
seated closely packed together; others standing by <lb/>
the wall, or grouped around. And there they stood <lb/>
in almost painful silence until the end. I never saw <lb/>
more attentive listeners. She began with a short <lb/>
prayer; then read part of a chapter, on which she <lb/>
commented in very simple but striking words, closing <lb/>
with a practical application and earnest personal <lb/>
appeal to the hearts of all present. After reading <lb/>
a hymn, she again prayed, and so ended the class. <lb/>
As we left the room, the respectful demeanour of the <lb/>
men struck me very much; and during the reading <lb/>
I saw one or two who came in late had taken off <lb/>
their shoes lest they should disturb her." In <reg orig="addi-|tion">addition</reg> <lb/>
to this class, Agnes held a Sunday Bible class <lb/>
for the nurses, for which her remaining notes show <lb/>
much thoughtful preparation. The nurses remember <lb/>
her as a dear, cherished, and affectionate sister, always <lb/>
faithful in reproof, but so considerate for the feelings <lb/>
and condition of all under her care. And the <reg orig="pa-|tients">patients</reg>, <lb/>
many of whom never remembered the name <lb/>
of Christ save in cursings, learned from her lips to <lb/>
pray and praise; many of whom, while clasping her <lb/>
hand, departed to the Saviour, rejoicing in forgiving <lb/>
love. One poor fellow, who was fast going home, <lb/>
said to the nurse, "The lady can never know what <lb/>
she has done for me." Another day he said, "O <lb/>
nurse, I wish no one but you ever came near me&mdash; <lb/>
no doctor, no one!" "Not even the lady?" she <lb/>
<pb n="43" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0050"/>
asked. "Oh, the lady! oh yes! I think I am in <lb/>
heaven when she comes." These bright glimpses of <lb/>
the results of her spiritual efforts induced Agnes to <lb/>
hold nightly Bible readings; and although they <lb/>
added to her many cares, they were for her special <lb/>
seasons of holy and calm rejoicing.</p>
<p>At the end of the second year the committee of <lb/>
the workhouse sent in a report upon the working of <lb/>
the system of trained nurses, which was so <reg orig="favour-|able">favourable</reg>, <lb/>
although a year of the time for the experiment <lb/>
was unexpired, that the vestry determined to adopt <lb/>
the system as a permanent one, and to extend it to <lb/>
the workhouse infirmary. Mr. Rathbone, who had <lb/>
been the instrument in procuring the change, sent <lb/>
the report and a note to Miss Jones:&mdash;"I send you <lb/>
the committee's masterly report. It could not have <lb/>
been better done, to do as much wide-spread good as <lb/>
possible. It will strengthen Miss Nightingale's hands <lb/>
and rejoice her heart. The success would have been <lb/>
impossible had it not been for your cheerful firmness <lb/>
and faith. I do most warmly congratulate you on <lb/>
having been so faithful a servant of Him to whom <lb/>
you look in a work so truly his own." While this <lb/>
resolution of the vestry must have been the source <lb/>
of much satisfaction to Miss Jones, it added <reg orig="mate-|rially">materially</reg> <lb/>
to her work and responsibility. Seventy wards <lb/>
and fourteen hundred people were now under her <lb/>
charge! Yet she shrank not from the labour, solaced <lb/>
by the strength given her of God, and encouraged by <lb/>
<pb n="44" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0051"/>
the improvement in the moral and physical condition <lb/>
of the poor inmates of the institution.</p>
<p>But all this care and labour were slowly but surely <lb/>
leaving their certain depressing effects upon a frame <lb/>
at the best not strong or robust; so that when disease <lb/>
took possession of her, the strength to resist its <reg orig="influ-|ence">influence</reg> <lb/>
was absent. One of the young nurses, who had <lb/>
been suffering from bronchitis, showed symptoms of <lb/>
typhus, when too ill to be removed to the hospital. <lb/>
Agnes had her placed in her own bed, sleeping <reg orig="her-|self">herself</reg> <lb/>
on the floor of her sitting-room. Very soon the <lb/>
care she had so long and devotedly bestowed upon <lb/>
others she required herself. The fatal typhus poison <lb/>
had already seized upon her. The doctor, it is true, <lb/>
gave hope that the dear patient would get through <lb/>
nicely. Everything that care and forethought could <lb/>
devise was done cheerfully by loving hands. In the <lb/>
midst of her illness her thoughts were for others&mdash; <lb/>
some duty to be done in the wards, tender words for <lb/>
nurses and friends, thanks and grateful recognition <lb/>
of the most simple services. Prayers from devout <lb/>
hearts were offered up both in and out of the <reg orig="work-|house">work-house</reg>. <lb/>
It seemed impossible that a life of so much <lb/>
usefulness should be taken away; nay, when the <lb/>
doctor said, "It will be a miracle if she live&mdash;the <lb/>
power of man cannot save her"&mdash;a friend observed, <lb/>
"A miracle will be wrought, then." But it was not <lb/>
to be. The labours of a life were ended; that which <lb/>
remained was the reward, which would never end. <lb/>
<pb n="45" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0052"/>
At two o'clock in the morning, on the 19th of <reg orig="Feb-|ruary">February</reg> <lb/>
1868, Agnes departed to her heavenly home. <lb/>
When the last moments had come, her own nurses <lb/>
stood around her bed. One of them whispered, "You'll <lb/>
soon be with Jesus." The reply sweetly came, "Yes; <lb/>
&mdash;I'll be better then." When she opened her eyes, <lb/>
which were bright and beautiful, she looked around <lb/>
as if she knew the faces about her. Looking <reg orig="lov-|ingly">lovingly</reg> <lb/>
at her only relative present, she said, "Auntie;" <lb/>
and her last word was spoken. The breathing <lb/>
became slower, and then it finally ceased. The <lb/>
dear, loving, and loved Agnes was with her <reg orig="Sav-|iour">Saviour</reg>.</p>
<p>When the time came for removing all that was <reg orig="mor-|tal">mortal</reg> <lb/>
of Agnes to her father's resting-place at Fahan, the <lb/>
nurses and probationers filled the room to take a last <lb/>
look of the revered face, which even in death had a <lb/>
bright and joyous expression. Before the coffin was <lb/>
removed, which was ornamented with a beautiful <lb/>
cross of white camellias, all knelt down in prayer. <lb/>
The poor old people left their wards to crowd the <lb/>
stairs and landings, to take a last farewell of one <lb/>
who had been to them an angel of mercy, and who <lb/>
for them had cheerfully laid down her life. The <lb/>
road from the workhouse was lined with people with <lb/>
full hearts and tearful eyes, as the mournful <reg orig="pro-|cession">procession</reg> <lb/>
proceeded to the vessel that was to convey <lb/>
the coffin to Ireland.</p>
<p>The funeral procession was met by all, old and <lb/>
<pb n="46" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0053"/>
young, in Fahan. The children were first arranged <lb/>
round the grave; then the young girls who had been <lb/>
members of the class taught by Agnes; next the <lb/>
middle-aged and old women. A thrill of solemn <lb/>
sympathy beat in the hearts of all as the bell tolled <lb/>
the approach of the hearse; a suppressed "Oh dear!" <lb/>
was heard as the coffin was gently lifted from the <lb/>
vehicle. When the beautiful service was ended, <lb/>
which had been tearfully joined in by all present, a <lb/>
charming wreath of snowdrops and primroses, twined <lb/>
with ivy and yew, was put into the grave&mdash;the little <lb/>
children scattering snowdrops, monthly roses, and <lb/>
spring flowers upon the coffin. All was done <reg orig="rev-|erently">reverently</reg> <lb/>
and lovingly; no stranger was permitted to <lb/>
do anything. The sorrow and mourning everywhere <lb/>
seen was softened by the thought that <hi rend="italic">she</hi> was laid <lb/>
among them.</p>
<p>Eloquently did Miss Nightingale improve this <lb/>
scene by saying:&mdash;"Let us add living flowers to her <lb/>
grave&mdash;'lilies with full hands,' not fleeting primroses, <lb/>
not dying flowers. Let us bring the work of our <lb/>
hands and our heads and our hearts to finish her <lb/>
work, which God has so blessed. Let her not merely <lb/>
rest in peace, but let hers be the life which stirs up <lb/>
to fight the good fight against vice and sin, and <lb/>
misery and wretchedness, as she did&mdash;the call to arms <lb/>
which she was ever obeying:&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>'The Son of God goes forth to war,</l>
<l rend="indent">Who follows in his train?'</l>
</lg></q>
<pb n="47" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0054"/>
Oh, daughters of God, are there so few to answer?" <lb/>
Few, indeed, if the useful and self-denying life of <lb/>
Miss Jones is hoped to be reached! How many <lb/>
would droop and turn away from the task ere it was <lb/>
half done! Think of the battle that would have to <lb/>
be fought&mdash;relinquishing all the dear pleasures and <lb/>
delights of home, the companionship of a fond mother <lb/>
and loving sisters, all the tastes and elegant <reg orig="employ-|ments">employments</reg> <lb/>
of a cultivated mind, and the associations of <lb/>
kindred spirits. And for what? To live among the <lb/>
very dregs of humanity, whose faults and failings it <lb/>
seems a contamination to contemplate; to be pent up <lb/>
with these miserable creatures days and months and <lb/>
years, breathing the air feculent with their <reg orig="abomina-|tions">abominations</reg>, <lb/>
and rarely getting a glimpse of the beautiful <lb/>
earth with its myriad charms! And for what? <hi rend="italic">For <lb/>
the dear Saviour's sake;</hi> in order that life might be <lb/>
spent usefully, and not uselessly; that sin and misery, <lb/>
wretchedness and crime, might be ameliorated; that <lb/>
the gospel of gladness might come to the hearts of <lb/>
the lost; and that moral death might give place to <lb/>
spiritual life. The light with which the loving <lb/>
Agnes was enlightened directed her to duty, not to <lb/>
selfish ease, personal comforts, or pleasures. And in <lb/>
doing that duty her heavenly Father remembered <lb/>
her with blessings that filled her with divine love, <lb/>
and converted a workhouse into "the very gate of <lb/>
heaven."</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">A visit</hi> to Holyoke Seminary and a <reg orig="con-|versation">conversation</reg> <lb/>
with its governess&mdash;Miss Lyon <lb/>
&mdash;would have been among the most <lb/>
pleasing recollections which a brief <reg orig="resi-|dence">residence</reg> <lb/>
in America could furnish. Holyoke Seminary, <lb/>
because guided and directed by a true Christian <lb/>
woman, was the birth-place of high resolves and <lb/>
holy lives. Many girls who went out into the world <lb/>
from that seminary carried with them the incentive <lb/>
of an earnest life&mdash;the example of confiding faith <lb/>
and "continuance in well-doing." The secret of Miss <lb/>
Lyon's success was not in her great and remarkable <lb/>
mental ability, it was earnestness; the consciousness <lb/>
that her life-task was work given her to do by the <lb/>
Master, and which she would do, continue to do, <lb/>
<pb n="50" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0057"/>
despite sickness and pain, to the end. Having found <lb/>
her work, the joy and happiness of her existence <lb/>
consisted in doing that work. She was not free <lb/>
from sorrow, nor preserved from disappointment; <lb/>
she had, however, so many joyous instances of the <lb/>
seed sown in young and receptive hearts bringing <lb/>
forth plentiful fruit, that her life might well be one <lb/>
of praise in being made the instrument of so much <lb/>
happiness. This was the result, not the motive of <lb/>
her life-work; and until this secret of happiness is <lb/>
understood, life is a very weariness and <reg orig="disappoint-|ment">disappointment</reg>. <lb/>
Mary Lyon, in the devotion and self-denial <lb/>
which marked her career, manifested the high resolve <lb/>
and purpose of a consecrated life. Had the fruit of <lb/>
her labour not appeared, she would still have worked <lb/>
on, influenced by the call of duty. Knowing the <lb/>
will of the Saviour, whatever disappointments might <lb/>
come she would still have worked on untiringly, <lb/>
leaving the result to be declared in the day when all <lb/>
hearts are opened.</p>
<p>Mary Lyon, like thousands of useful women, <reg orig="de-|clared">declared</reg>, <lb/>
"I am more indebted to my mother than to <lb/>
all others, except my Maker." Her mother had very <lb/>
early become a disciple of the Saviour; and her <lb/>
father, who left her when only six years of age <lb/>
to join her little brother, who had gone before, was a <lb/>
truly devout and confiding Christian. The old family <lb/>
Bible recorded the day of his death&mdash;December 21, <lb/>
1802; but it needed no written record to rivet upon <lb/>
<pb n="51" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0058"/>
the memories and hearts of the seven children who <lb/>
surrounded the bed of their dying father his last <lb/>
words and earnest counsels. Mary's mother, when <lb/>
her loved husband was taken from her, was <reg orig="con-|strained">constrained</reg> <lb/>
to say Amen to God's will; but it was a <lb/>
severe and heart-breaking trial. That which <reg orig="con-|cerned">concerned</reg> <lb/>
her most she expressed in these words: "Oh, <lb/>
the weight that rolled on my mind for my dear <reg orig="chil-|dren">children</reg>, <lb/>
and how I should bring them up in the nurture <lb/>
and admonition of the Lord!" For many weeks the <lb/>
much-tried mother sorrowed for the husband of her <lb/>
youth; then came the gift of divine strength, of rest <lb/>
and confidence, and renewed earnestness. The <reg orig="ex-|ample">example</reg> <lb/>
and prayers of her mother, although so young, <lb/>
made a lasting impression upon Mary Lyon. Her <lb/>
home, although poor and scantily furnished, was the <lb/>
home of care, of comfort, and industry. The clothes <lb/>
worn by Mary and her brothers and sisters were not <lb/>
only home made, but the material was of home <lb/>
manufacture. Industry, economy, care, and <reg orig="fore-|thought">forethought</reg> <lb/>
were the characteristics of the mountain <lb/>
farm. "Never," Mary's mother was accustomed to <lb/>
say, "destroy anything that God has made, or given <lb/>
skill to others to make. Economy and self-denial <lb/>
are the two great springs which feed the fountains <lb/>
of benevolence. Practise them for Christ's sake; but <lb/>
talk very little about them. Be very thankful for a <lb/>
little, and you will receive the more."</p>
<p>It was in this home school that Mary learned the <lb/>
<pb n="52" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0059"/>
lessons of use and service which she incorporated in <lb/>
after years in her own instruction in Holyoke <lb/>
Seminary. But in the midst of home duties and the <lb/>
acquirement of useful habits her mental education <lb/>
was not neglected. It is true that much of it was <lb/>
self-acquired, and was, in consequence, more firmly <lb/>
impressed and rooted. At seventeen she entered <lb/>
upon the duties of a school teacher at Shelburne <lb/>
Falls, Massachusetts. The salary was not large&mdash; <lb/>
three shillings and three halfpence weekly; but then <lb/>
she had to "board round" with the parents of the <lb/>
children. Mary made herself so useful that many of <lb/>
the farmers would willingly have kept her altogether. <lb/>
It was something to talk about, that the school <lb/>
teacher could bring out damask from the old <reg orig="hand-|loom">hand-loom</reg>; <lb/>
that she understood practically the whole art <lb/>
and mystery of weaving. But although giving great <lb/>
satisfaction to the parents of the children, she was <lb/>
not herself perfectly satisfied, and was resolved, so <lb/>
soon as the school term ended, never to teach again. <lb/>
Happily she overcame this repugnance to routine <lb/>
duty, and was afterwards accustomed to say to her <lb/>
pupils, "If you commence teaching, and do not <reg orig="suc-|ceed">succeed</reg>, <lb/>
teach till you <hi rend="italic">do</hi> succeed." And then she ever <lb/>
commended the true object of teaching&mdash;not salary <lb/>
or the fees of pupils, but the improvement and <reg orig="train-|ing">training</reg> <lb/>
of useful lives on earth in order that they might <lb/>
be saved in heaven. Teaching came to her as blessed <lb/>
work because it was useful work. She had, however, <lb/>
<pb n="53" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0060"/>
a reward which was priceless&mdash;the love of grateful <lb/>
hearts. In Holyoke Seminary she was accustomed <lb/>
to say to her pupils, "I hardly expect many of you <lb/>
to give your lives to teaching; but she who can <lb/>
teach well, control the minds of the young happily <lb/>
and rightly, is all the better prepared for every <lb/>
sphere to which a lady can be called. But if you <lb/>
teach, never expect to govern others till you can <lb/>
govern yourself." "Self-control is never perfect till <lb/>
we can cheerfully meet our own government; nor <lb/>
is a child really governed till he can smile under <lb/>
government." "Young ladies," she would add, "never <lb/>
ask to live simply for yourselves. Live for the good <lb/>
of others, and you will find your cup of happiness <lb/>
running over, even in this world; and oh, what will <lb/>
it be in heaven! Be willing to do anything and go <lb/>
anywhere for the good of others; and remember that <lb/>
you are responsible for elevating the character of <lb/>
every one with whom you have to do."</p>
<p>Up to her twentieth year Mary Lyon had not had <lb/>
the advantage of attending any school superior to <lb/>
her own when she was "boarding round." In the <lb/>
autumn of 1817 she entered an academy at Ashfield; <lb/>
as, however, she was too poor to pay for board and <lb/>
tuition, she paid for the former by work in the <reg orig="farm-|houses">farmhouses</reg>. <lb/>
As she could not even then pay the school <lb/>
fees, and had resolved to return to her home duties <lb/>
of spinning and weaving, the trustees of the academy <lb/>
gave her free tuition. This liberality was induced <lb/>
<pb n="54" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0061"/>
by the great progress Mary had made in her studies. <lb/>
She had&mdash;so it was generally believed&mdash;learned the <lb/>
Latin Grammar in three days; and was able to <reg orig="re-|cite">recite</reg> <lb/>
and take her place in every class in the school! <lb/>
One of her most cherished studies was chemistry; <lb/>
her knowledge of which she delighted to impart to <lb/>
her subsequent pupils. At Amherst Academy she <lb/>
became endeared to every pupil by her self-denial, <lb/>
kindness, and willing service. A daughter of one <lb/>
who was a member of Amherst Academy with Miss <lb/>
Lyon, said: "When a little girl, my mother used to <lb/>
sit and tell us about Mary Lyon at school. She <lb/>
would make us see just how she looked in her <reg orig="linsey-|woolsey">linsey-woolsey</reg> <lb/>
dress, and how ready she was to give a kind <lb/>
look and a loving heart to every one. She was <lb/>
always to be found, out of school hours, in her <lb/>
favourite corner, studying as hard as she could, but <lb/>
ready to help every one that cared to be helped. If <lb/>
any one wished to change her seat in the <reg orig="school-|room">schoolroom</reg>, <lb/>
'Oh, I will change with you! I should like to <lb/>
do so, if you prefer my seat,' would be heard from <lb/>
Mary Lyon's lips. If there was an undesirable <reg orig="seat-|mate">seat-mate</reg> <lb/>
in all the school, she was always ready to sit <lb/>
by her, and help her on her way, even though it was <lb/>
on a window-seat. And mother would add, 'Do you <lb/>
wonder, my little girls, that we all loved and <reg orig="re-|spected">respected</reg> <lb/>
Mary Lyon?'" When the girls that had <lb/>
been pupils with Mary became women, and had <lb/>
children of their own, it was not wonderful that <lb/>
<pb n="55" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0062"/>
they sent them to Holyoke Academy to be guided <lb/>
and instructed by Mary Lyon. Many mothers, on <lb/>
leaving the world, have made it a last request that <lb/>
their girls should be put under Mary's care.</p>
<p>When Miss Lyon had attained her twenty-fourth <lb/>
year she obtained the means to study under the care <lb/>
and direction of the Rev. Joseph Emerson, principal <lb/>
of Byfield Academy. This gentleman, fortunately <lb/>
for Miss Lyon, had a very high conception of female <lb/>
character and intellect. In his instruction, he made <lb/>
no difference between the sexes. He recognized <lb/>
woman's capability, and therefore right, to aspire to <lb/>
literary attainments; while he assigned her the place <lb/>
in the work of the world's improvement in which <lb/>
Providence had placed her. Mary Lyon learned <lb/>
from Mr. Emerson "that in some things woman's <lb/>
intellect may not be equal to the opposite sex; but <lb/>
in other things, not less noble or important for the <lb/>
world, she excels." She recognized this fact "as <lb/>
dictated by infinite wisdom and goodness, not for <lb/>
the elevation of the one, or for the depression of the <lb/>
other, but for the promotion of the greatest good of <lb/>
the whole." Miss Lyon was accustomed to refer to <lb/>
the excellent teaching of Mr. Emerson as the source <lb/>
of much of her own instruction. "Any lady," she <lb/>
would say, "who has occasion to excel in guiding <lb/>
her household; in being the active head of all her <lb/>
various departments of domestic labour; in <reg orig="presid-|ing">presiding</reg> <lb/>
in the parlour and at the table without display <lb/>
<pb n="56" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0063"/>
or diffidence; in rendering her house the abode of <lb/>
hospitality as well as of domestic happiness; in <reg orig="be-|coming">becoming</reg> <lb/>
a skilful teacher for her own children, and <lb/>
for others who may be gathered into the Sabbath <lb/>
school or Bible-class; and in being the mainspring of <lb/>
many a benevolent association; and, besides all, who <lb/>
finds it desirable to be intelligent on most subjects of <lb/>
practical interest, and, it may be, too, to be literary <lb/>
without vanity, and scientific without ostentation;&mdash; <lb/>
any lady who has occasion for all this will have <lb/>
good reason for gratitude that she ever enjoyed the <lb/>
privilege of sitting under the instruction of my <lb/>
dearly beloved and highly revered teacher."</p>
<p>On leaving Mr. Emerson's academy Miss Lyon <reg orig="im-|mediately">immediately</reg> <lb/>
engaged herself as a teacher in the <reg orig="Ash-|field">Ashfield</reg> <lb/>
Academy, where she continued for two years. <lb/>
Then, much to her delight, she received an invitation <lb/>
to take charge of the Adam's Female Academy in <lb/>
Derry. Here she was united, aided, and helped by <lb/>
her dear friend Miss Grant, who was ready to carry <lb/>
out the views of Mr. Emerson relative to the <reg orig="educa-|tion">education</reg> <lb/>
of young ladies. The education imparted to the <lb/>
pupils was not merely intellectual education, having <lb/>
reference to this life. They were instructed in that <lb/>
discipline, guidance, and self-control which constitutes <lb/>
the true Christian in daily duty.</p>
<p>In the year 1824 she opened a school for young <lb/>
ladies in Buckland, which was attended the first <lb/>
winter by twenty-five pupils. The progress made <lb/>
<pb n="57" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0064"/>
by these girls induced many parents to send their <lb/>
daughters the next winter. Knowledge was <reg orig="pre-|sented">presented</reg> <lb/>
so attractively, the lessons were made so <reg orig="in-|teresting">interesting</reg>, <lb/>
that school-life became in the presence of <lb/>
Miss Lyon pure, unmixed enjoyment. But training <lb/>
the intellect of her dear pupils was only a part of <lb/>
the purpose and desire of Miss Lyon. She had <lb/>
hopes that the religious instruction and Bible lessons <lb/>
imparted to the girls would have an influence upon <lb/>
their hearts. This seemed to be about to be <reg orig="accom-|plished">accomplished</reg> <lb/>
when she wrote in December: "That heart <lb/>
must be insensible which does not feel in observing <lb/>
the general attention manifested when a sermon is <lb/>
reviewed, a Bible lesson recited, or any religious <lb/>
subject brought forward. Perhaps the Lord may <lb/>
visit us by his grace. In him is all our hope." <reg orig="Be-|fore">Before</reg> <lb/>
the school-term closed, delightful religious scenes <lb/>
were witnessed among the girls. A deep and hearty <lb/>
religious zeal had settled upon them; many of them <lb/>
had realized by heart-felt experience that God <reg orig="for-|gives">forgives</reg> <lb/>
sins. When they returned home they were <lb/>
renewed in their minds, and had commenced lives of <lb/>
earnest piety. Referring to this period, Miss Lyon <lb/>
subsequently wrote: "Those days must be numbered <lb/>
with the most precious of my life; and sometimes I <lb/>
can scarcely believe that all those scenes were real." <lb/>
When the fathers went for their daughters at the <lb/>
close of the term, their hearts were full of <reg orig="unutter-|able">unutterable</reg> <lb/>
thanks. They thanked God for the providence <lb/>
<pb n="58" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0065"/>
which had enabled them to place their girls under <lb/>
Miss Lyon's care, and for the change of heart which <lb/>
had made them a blessed home influence, an <reg orig="influ-|ence">influence</reg> <lb/>
which extended to the neighbourhood in which <lb/>
they lived, in prayer meetings, in Sabbath schools, <lb/>
and in benevolent societies. Many a pastor was <reg orig="en-|couraged">encouraged</reg> <lb/>
in his labours by the zeal and earnestness <lb/>
of the girls that had attended Miss Lyon's school. <lb/>
They were not only concerned about their own <reg orig="sal-|vation">salvation</reg>, <lb/>
but about the salvation of all with whom <lb/>
they came in contact.</p>
<p>This delightful experience, in the change of the <lb/>
hearts of her pupils, was now Miss Lyon's constant <lb/>
hope and desire; and in the good providence of God, <lb/>
in answer to many fervent prayers, all through the <lb/>
remainder of her life this joyous experience was <lb/>
accorded to her.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1826 she returned to Derry, and <lb/>
witnessed, in the first term, twenty of the girls <reg orig="be-|coming">becoming</reg> <lb/>
Christians. Many of these girls had resolved <lb/>
upon becoming teachers. To them, especially, Mary <lb/>
addressed many earnest words. "Young ladies," she <lb/>
would say, "think what a privilege it is to labour <lb/>
for immortal minds. How much better than to <lb/>
spend your lives seeking happiness alone! The life <lb/>
that I desire for you is as much above the <reg orig="pleasure-|seeker's">pleasure-seeker's</reg> <lb/>
as an archangel is above an infant. You <lb/>
have been accustomed to follow where I have led <lb/>
you. Now you are to be seated on a throne of your <lb/>
<pb n="59" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0066"/>
own. You can sway a golden sceptre there. Be <lb/>
sure you do so." To those girls who were going from <lb/>
school to home duties she was equally earnest in <lb/>
counsel: they must be an influence and an <reg orig="incen-|tive">incentive</reg> <lb/>
to those with whom they come in contact, and <lb/>
teach by their lives the delight of oneness with their <lb/>
heavenly Father.</p>
<p>In the winter of 1830 it was known that Miss <lb/>
Lyon would not again take charge of a school in <lb/>
Buckland. This, probably, induced a larger number <lb/>
of pupils to attend than would otherwise have done. <lb/>
The good people of the place put themselves to much <lb/>
inconvenience in order to accommodate boarders. It <lb/>
was felt to be a Christian duty to induce all to come <lb/>
by offering them a home; and if they were unable <lb/>
to pay for their board, then they were promised to <lb/>
be boarded for nothing. One gentleman gave up his <lb/>
attic; which, by being divided by quilts and blankets <lb/>
into four compartments, accommodated eight persons. <lb/>
The school, which a few winters previously had only <lb/>
numbered twenty-five pupils, now numbered <reg orig="ninety-|nine">ninety-nine</reg>. <lb/>
Owing to the genial and Christian kindness <lb/>
exercised over the girls, they learned to love one <lb/>
another, to love their studies, and to become pliant <lb/>
and docile. Many Christian friends, rejoicing in Miss <lb/>
Lyon's labours, proposed that a permanent school <lb/>
should be erected, to be under her care. After much <lb/>
labour and prayer, after a year of continuous toil, <lb/>
Mount Holyoke Seminary came into existence.</p>
<pb n="60" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0067"/>
<p>In the November of 1837 the institution was opened, <lb/>
&mdash;an institution which exercised an important <reg orig="life-|influence">life-influence</reg> <lb/>
upon many young ladies, who went out <lb/>
into the world with settled convictions and Christian <lb/>
characters. One novel and important feature of the <lb/>
seminary was its housekeeping department. The <lb/>
girls were taught, in sharing with the domestics the <lb/>
duties of the house, not drudging labour, but how to <lb/>
fill their time usefully and profitably. The girls <lb/>
were not taught domestic work as a part of the <lb/>
education imparted at the seminary; it was imposed <lb/>
to show the value of system, promptness, and fidelity. <lb/>
It was very properly supposed that the domestic <lb/>
work committed to the charge of the young ladies <lb/>
would furnish many opportunities for the <reg orig="manifesta-|tion">manifestation</reg> <lb/>
of a generous, obliging, and self-denying spirit, <lb/>
which would be felt and seen through life. This was <lb/>
realized in many a happy experience.</p>
<p>The first four years in Mount Holyoke Seminary <lb/>
were years of earnestness and usefulness. The <reg orig="com-|plete">complete</reg> <lb/>
devotion of Miss Lyon to the important charge <lb/>
committed to her, the intellectual progress, but, <lb/>
above all, the spiritual growth of her pupils, absorbed <lb/>
her entire energy. One incident which broke the <lb/>
ordinary course of school-life was the death of one of <lb/>
the girls. A slow fever, which would not be subdued <lb/>
by medical aid, carried the gentle sufferer to the <lb/>
grave. But there was no fear as to the future. The <lb/>
dying one had been taught to repose in her Saviour, <lb/>
<pb n="61" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0068"/>
and now feared no evil. When the hour of departure <lb/>
arrived, Miss Lyon was immediately by her side. <lb/>
Too weak to speak, the dear girl's eyes kindled with <lb/>
brightness, not of earth, when she saw her loved <lb/>
teacher. Kneeling down and taking the hand of the <lb/>
departing young disciple, she gently whispered, <lb/>
"Jesus has come for you, Adaline. Now you will <lb/>
not be afraid, will you? He will carry you safely <lb/>
over. You have nothing to do but to look directly <lb/>
to him. You will suffer only a little while longer." <lb/>
The dear girl was speechless; she could not <reg orig="ex-|press">express</reg> <lb/>
in words the rest and confidence which she <lb/>
felt in her departure. As her face, however, was <lb/>
lighted up with a joyous smile, now resting upon <lb/>
the loved form of her teacher, and then turned away <lb/>
as if to dwell upon the assured presence of the <lb/>
Saviour, those who looked upon her needed not to <lb/>
be told of the joy of her departure, or that her <lb/>
Saviour had gently led her from a world of suffering <lb/>
and trial to a world of ever-enduring joy. This sad <lb/>
deprivation had a solemnizing effect upon the other <lb/>
pupils. The room in which the dear departed one <lb/>
was laid became the scene of many solemn prayers, <lb/>
so that every girl in the school gave her heart to <lb/>
God, and became joined to the Saviour as his <reg orig="dis-|ciple">disciple</reg>. <lb/>
Little did many of them think that very <lb/>
shortly others also would be called upon to depart. <lb/>
During the vacation of 1840, when the pupils were <lb/>
chiefly in their own homes, one after another was <lb/>
<pb n="62" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0069"/>
attacked by typhus fever, until forty of the dear <lb/>
girls lay upon sick-beds. Nine of the number were <lb/>
called away to join the redeemed in another and a <lb/>
brighter world. The testimony from the death-bed <lb/>
of each of these girls was the same&mdash;confident trust <lb/>
and repose in the Saviour&mdash;no doubts or fears. They <lb/>
knew in whom they had believed, and that they <lb/>
were going to be for ever with the Lord.</p>
<p>This sad sickness and the loss of her loved young <lb/>
friends deeply impressed Miss Lyon. She was led to <lb/>
consider whether it was God's will that any changes <lb/>
should be made in her plans and arrangements. <lb/>
Some unkind reports had been circulated relative to <lb/>
the seminary. There was no recrimination or any <lb/>
desire for a public vindication. "If our feelings are <lb/>
grieved by what is reported of us," said Miss Lyon, <lb/>
"let us remember the example of our Saviour. He <lb/>
was silent; he opened not his mouth. Let God, in <lb/>
his own way and in his own time, vindicate his own <lb/>
acts. Let us commit ourselves to the care of a <reg orig="cove-|nant-keeping">covenant-keeping</reg> <lb/>
God, who doeth all things well."</p>
<p>When the school was re-opened, eighty young <lb/>
ladies assembled in the hall to take part in the <lb/>
opening meeting. The devotional service, led <reg orig="affec-|tionately">affectionately</reg> <lb/>
and lovingly by Miss Lyon, was deeply <lb/>
impressive. The pupils were taught by that first <lb/>
service that their spiritual welfare was the supreme <lb/>
consideration,&mdash;that they came to the seminary not <lb/>
only to acquire secular knowledge, but that higher, <lb/>
<pb n="63" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0070"/>
spiritual knowledge, which would fit them for true <lb/>
enjoyment in this world, and for the blessedness of <lb/>
the heavenly world. Out of all that throng of girls, <lb/>
before the school-term had closed, with the exception <lb/>
of four, all had given their hearts to God! The <lb/>
pupils who were privileged to attend the seminary <lb/>
remember with special interest the opening session <lb/>
meetings. Upon the first meeting after the sickness <lb/>
and death of so many of the pupils, Miss Lyon <reg orig="ad-|dressed">addressed</reg> <lb/>
the assembled girls in earnest and loving <lb/>
words.</p>
<p>"There is always," she said, "a peculiar interest in <lb/>
meeting our dear family at the commencement of the <lb/>
school year. We remember those dear familiar faces <lb/>
with us last year, which we shall see here no more. <lb/>
We thank God for the precious privilege which was <lb/>
ours of labouring for them. We follow them with <lb/>
our love; we will remember them around this family <lb/>
altar. We welcome old friends returning home with <lb/>
smiling countenances; and we also welcome these <lb/>
strangers. They will not long be strangers. Some <lb/>
of you are the daughters of those we tenderly love, <lb/>
and we are ready to give our love and sympathy to <lb/>
you all. My heart goes out very tenderly this <lb/>
morning to those parents who have intrusted you to <lb/>
my care. Those parents have no choicer treasures <lb/>
than these precious daughters. We are ready to <lb/>
labour for you in love and fidelity; and may you all <lb/>
be faithful to us; and&mdash;oh, what inexpressible <reg orig="ten-|derness">tenderness</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="64" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0071"/>
in the thought!&mdash;that you may all be <reg orig="pre-|paring">preparing</reg> <lb/>
for heaven here!"</p>
<p>And then when the term came to an end, and the <lb/>
young ladies were about to return home, Miss Lyon <lb/>
spoke to them of the many openings and methods of <lb/>
doing good: of the importance of sustaining an <reg orig="in-|terest">interest</reg> <lb/>
in prayer meetings and Sabbath schools; of <lb/>
religious and serious conversation; of seeking out <lb/>
and benefiting the poor; of kindly converse with <lb/>
children; and of consistent Christian home <reg orig="deport-|ment">deportment</reg>. <lb/>
They were taught that their friends would <lb/>
expect much from them, that the Saviour would look <lb/>
to them for useful labour, and that it was their duty <lb/>
to elevate the standard of excellence around them.</p>
<p>The year 1842 commenced at the seminary with a <lb/>
new wing to the old building, and an overflowing <lb/>
number of pupils, which necessitated additional <lb/>
teachers. These new assistants were, as Miss Lyon <lb/>
believed, raised up by a kind Providence for the <lb/>
work they had to do. One of them, in speaking of <lb/>
Miss Lyon, said: "They regarded her with mingled <lb/>
love, confidence, and veneration, entered <reg orig="enthusiasti-|cally">enthusiastically</reg> <lb/>
into her views, and saw in her the servant of <lb/>
the Lord raised up for the work she was doing. In <lb/>
selecting her assistants, Miss Lyon's first question <lb/>
was not, Are you of one denomination or another? <lb/>
but, Are you like the Lord Jesus Christ, willing to <lb/>
make yourselves poor, that others through your <lb/>
poverty may be rich?" A weekly meeting with the <lb/>
<pb n="65" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0072"/>
teachers for prayer and consultation enabled Miss <lb/>
Lyon to animate her assistants with her own spirit. <lb/>
She met them as an elder sister, and interchanged <lb/>
views as members of one united loving family. At <lb/>
the close of these meetings she was accustomed to <reg orig="ad-|dress">address</reg> <lb/>
a few earnest words on some important subject <lb/>
to the teachers. One of these meetings was closed <lb/>
with these words: "I think we should be careful to <lb/>
observe the general regulations of our family&mdash;try to <lb/>
be systematic. I have suffered all my life from the <lb/>
want of regular habits. I wish you to accustom <lb/>
yourselves to be thoroughly systematic in the division <lb/>
of your time and duties. I know you have many <lb/>
interruptions, and many little things to look after; <lb/>
but so it must be with ladies. I really think it <lb/>
requires more discipline of mind and more grace to <lb/>
meet a lady's duties than a gentleman's. He has <lb/>
little of minuti&aelig; to attend to; he can rise in the <lb/>
morning and go to his business without hindrance. <lb/>
But it is not so with a lady; and I would not have <lb/>
it otherwise." In addition to these business meetings, <lb/>
weekly prayer-meetings were held among the teachers, <lb/>
when special prayers were offered for the various <lb/>
departments of the seminary, and for the spiritual <lb/>
benefit of the pupils. The teachers went out from <lb/>
these meetings encouraged to fresh exertion and <lb/>
renewed efforts on behalf of the spiritual interests of <lb/>
the young ladies.</p>
<p>There was one cause which, outside of the <reg orig="semi-|nary">seminary</reg>, <lb/>
<pb n="66" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0073"/>
had an absorbing interest for Miss Lyon. <reg orig="Mis-|sionaries">Missionaries</reg>, <lb/>
and the cause of missions, were very dear <lb/>
and near to her heart. The meetings of the American <lb/>
Mission Board, where men in all conditions of life <lb/>
assembled to devise means to send the gospel to the <lb/>
far-off places of the earth, were to her the most <lb/>
attractive, refreshing, and spiritual meetings. Upon <lb/>
occasions, she was accustomed to say, "If I am <reg orig="per-|mitted">permitted</reg> <lb/>
to behold one more public scene of moral <lb/>
sublimity, let that be another annual meeting of the <lb/>
American Board;" when she would add,&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"Why was I made to hear Thy voice</l>
<l rend="indent">And enter while there's room,</l>
<l>When thousands make a wretched choice</l>
<l rend="indent">And rather starve than come?"</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>That which Miss Lyon enjoyed, she would share <lb/>
with every human being. The spiritual blessings <lb/>
which filled her heart with peace she would have to <lb/>
fill every heart. The dear girls whom she so <reg orig="ten-|derly">tenderly</reg> <lb/>
led to the Great Shepherd, she would have <lb/>
devoted to the life-work of directing sinners to the <lb/>
Saviour. In urging contributions in aid of <reg orig="mis-|sionary">missionary</reg> <lb/>
work, she said, "It is a privilege to give even <lb/>
the widow's mite. I want you to meet all your <lb/>
treasures in heaven. But remember that riches may <lb/>
be corrupted. We shall find they have been, in the <lb/>
last great day. We shall then find garments <reg orig="moth-|eaten">moth-eaten</reg>, <lb/>
gold and silver cankered, and rust that will <lb/>
eat flesh as fire. But, my dear pupils, you may sell <lb/>
<pb n="67" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0074"/>
all that you have and give alms, and you will find a <lb/>
treasure in heaven. And, oh, what a treasure it <lb/>
will be!&mdash;redeemed souls carried to heaven through <lb/>
your instrumentality!" Many of those dear girls <lb/>
subsequently gave, not only of their substance, but <lb/>
themselves to the work of missions. Fired with the <lb/>
zeal of their teacher, they went out to distant parts <lb/>
of the earth to carry tidings of the gospel which had <lb/>
first come to their own hearts in Holyoke Seminary. <lb/>
When parting with her loved pupil Miss Fidelia <lb/>
Fiske, who went out with a missionary company to <lb/>
Persia, she whispered her last words:&mdash;"You will <lb/>
pray for us&mdash;will you not?&mdash;all the way to Persia. <lb/>
As you remember the dear seminary you cannot do <lb/>
otherwise. When you lie in your berth, will you <lb/>
not carry us to God?"</p>
<p>The lesson Miss Lyon ever impressed upon her <lb/>
pupils was resignation&mdash;rest and content in the place <lb/>
and position to which God called them. The most <lb/>
obscure position, equally with the most prominent <lb/>
and useful, could be honoured, and would be <reg orig="hon-|oured">honoured</reg>, <lb/>
by God, if they were only faithful. Thus the <lb/>
missionary spirit which, under the guidance of God's <lb/>
providence, directed Miss Fiske to Persia, would not <lb/>
less direct the labours of the young Christians to fields <lb/>
of usefulness at home. Opportunity could never be <lb/>
wanting. A "love for souls," and a wide-open <reg orig="mis-|sion">mission</reg> <lb/>
field, would be presented to every young lady <lb/>
who had heard of Christ in the Holyoke Seminary.</p>
<pb n="68" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0075"/>
<p>After ten years' labours in her beloved <reg orig="employ-|ment">employment</reg>, <lb/>
Miss Lyon had the happiness to be able to say, <lb/>
"I thank God that I have not yet heard of the death <lb/>
of any pupil of this beloved seminary without hope <lb/>
in Jesus. If any have thus died, I have been spared <lb/>
the trial of hearing of it." However successful the <lb/>
intellectual training of the girls had been, the session <lb/>
would have been declared barren unless many of <lb/>
them had given their hearts to God. There had been <lb/>
differences in the school-terms,&mdash;sometimes twenty, <lb/>
forty, and sixty were united to Christ; but no session <lb/>
had passed without Miss Lyon having cause to rejoice <lb/>
in some of her dear pupils having taken the hand of <lb/>
the Saviour, and become joined to him in a holy, <lb/>
devoted life. This was the happiness she sought, <lb/>
and this was the gift constantly poured out upon her <lb/>
&mdash;constantly blessing her useful existence.</p>
<p>But the time of her departure was at hand. The <lb/>
work which had been given her to do, and which she <lb/>
had done with all her heart and strength, was now <lb/>
to meet its heavenly reward. For months her <reg orig="in-|cessant">incessant</reg> <lb/>
labours had severely tried her constitution, <lb/>
but on the eve of her joining the heavenly throng it <lb/>
seemed as if her body and mind were about to be <lb/>
renewed, and that many years would still be given <lb/>
to her in which to prepare souls for Christ; but the <lb/>
earthly day was closing, and the bright clear day of <lb/>
eternity was about to dawn.</p>
<p>Shortly after the commencement of the session of <lb/>
<pb n="69" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0076"/>
1848, one of the pupils was confined to her room <lb/>
with a severe attack of influenza, which disease was <lb/>
then prevalent in the school. In a day or two it was <lb/>
thought that she was recovering, and she was <reg orig="per-|mitted">permitted</reg> <lb/>
to go to the recitations in the schoolroom. A <lb/>
relapse was shortly experienced, which assumed the <lb/>
form of malignant erysipelas. Miss Lyon, who was <lb/>
then suffering from influenza and a severe nervous <lb/>
headache, hastened to the bedside of her loved pupil, <lb/>
and, regardless of possible danger from the contagious <lb/>
disease, poured words of comfort into the ear of the <lb/>
sufferer. Then on the next day she called the girls <lb/>
together, and addressed them solemnly and with <lb/>
great earnestness on the duty which now lay upon <lb/>
them to turn their thoughts to the "celestial city; <lb/>
and, as its pearly gates opened to receive the dying <lb/>
girl, to look in and catch a glimpse of its glories." <lb/>
Then with ecstatic rapture she added, "Oh, if it were <lb/>
I, how happy I should be to go!" That night the <lb/>
spirit of the young girl entered its eternal rest. At <lb/>
five o'clock next morning the pupils were assembled <lb/>
to join in prayer, before the remains of their <reg orig="school-|mate">schoolmate</reg> <lb/>
were removed. Miss Lyon feelingly read the <lb/>
hymn commencing,&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"Why do we mourn departed friends?"</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>This was the last time the pupils heard the voice <lb/>
of their loved teacher. They little thought that <lb/>
they would soon be called upon to mourn her <reg orig="depar-|ture">departure</reg>. <lb/>
<pb n="70" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0077"/>
The dreaded erysipelas had taken possession <lb/>
of her frame. When it was announced that there <lb/>
was great danger, joy and happiness beamed from <lb/>
her countenance. On a friend inquiring if she was <lb/>
happy, she replied, "Oh, I am so happy! I am the <lb/>
happiest of the happy. I only wish I could find <lb/>
words to express my happiness." Then when her <lb/>
pastor came with the inquiry, "Is Christ precious <lb/>
to you?" she made a last effort, and lifting her <lb/>
head from the pillow, exclaimed, with special <reg orig="em-|phasis">emphasis</reg>, <lb/>
"Yes!" When hymns and passages of <reg orig="Scrip-|ture">Scripture</reg> <lb/>
were read to her, she made many efforts to <lb/>
speak, but without success. On being told that she <lb/>
need not speak, that God could be glorified in silence, <lb/>
a seraphic smile suffused her countenance, giving <lb/>
joyous assurance of the support her Saviour gave her <lb/>
as she passed the river to regions of eternal day. No <lb/>
more words passed her lips. They were not needed <lb/>
to assure her dear friends who were gathered around <lb/>
her bed of the wealth of joy that filled her heart, of <lb/>
her realizing the promises of her heavenly Father, <lb/>
that he would be with her as she passed through the <lb/>
dark valley. Like a wave dying upon the shore, her <lb/>
spirit departed from a life of usefulness, to be "for <lb/>
ever with the Lord."</p>

though they may be; the aroma&mdash; <lb/>

as a permanent, an abiding blessing. The example <lb/>
of a life of toil, effort, and endeavour, quickens <lb/>
and energizes imitation. "What man has done man <lb/>
may do," is, however, not true in all cases. <reg orig="Circum-|stances">Circumstances</reg> <lb/>
and conditions must be taken into account, <lb/>
which may prevent even the attempt to follow in <lb/>
the footsteps of those who have left "footprints on <lb/>

dedication of a life to some exclusive work of need <lb/>
and necessity, there always exists, in every place and <lb/>
<pb n="72" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0079"/>
at all times, the opportunity to "do good"&mdash;to <lb/>
benefit, to bless, to succour those around us. How <lb/>
few, for instance, could imitate the self-denial, the <lb/>
courage, and endurance exhibited by Fidelia Fiske <lb/>
in her angel mission to the degraded women of <lb/>
Persia! But are there not degraded women, lost <lb/>
and neglected children, in all our large towns? If <lb/>
we cannot visit the dark and distant places of the <lb/>
globe, can we not seek out the wretched, miserable <lb/>
lives which are ever to be found in the by-lanes of <lb/>
our own cities, towns, and villages? It is not so much <lb/>
the opportunity that is wanting as the will and <lb/>
effort. Let there be the disposition and the desire, <lb/>
and no day will pass without some poor creature <lb/>
being blessed with kindly words, with substantial <lb/>
gifts, that shall cheer and encourage her in the <reg orig="up-|ward">upward</reg> <lb/>
path, and induce in her the blessed belief that <lb/>
Christianity is a reality, and not a mere empty name <lb/>
and profession. Fidelia Fiske, however, believed in <lb/>
the command to "go into all the world," to the <lb/>
most distant parts of the world, to carry Christ's <lb/>
truth, and the blessings of Christ's teaching and <lb/>
gospel. Had she remained at home amongst her <lb/>
friends, surrounded by all that makes life cheerful, <lb/>
she would have secured all desired comforts and <lb/>
earthly happiness. She, however, believed in duty; <lb/>
and if the call came from a distance&mdash;if an opening <lb/>
appeared for work&mdash;for work which she could do, <lb/>
ease and comfort, friends and relatives, must not be <lb/>
<pb n="73" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0080"/>
considered or allowed to stand in the way of that <lb/>
which she received and believed to be the Master's <lb/>
call.</p>
<p>The father of Fidelia Fiske descended from a long <lb/>
line of pious men and women, commencing with two <lb/>
brothers, William and the Rev. John Fiske, who <lb/>
emigrated from the county of Suffolk to America in <lb/>
1637. The Rev. Cotton Mather mentions the Rev. <lb/>
John Fiske as one of the "reverend, learned, and <lb/>
holy divines, by whose evangelical ministry the <lb/>
churches of New England have been illuminated." <lb/>
From William Fiske descended a second William, a <lb/>
man of rare intelligence and Christian integrity, who <lb/>
occupied many important public offices with great <lb/>
credit. This eminent Christian had a son named <lb/>
Ebenezer, who was born in 1679, and who also filled <lb/>
the office of deacon of the church at Wenham, and <lb/>
died at the age of ninety-two. He had a reputation <lb/>
of being a man of great influence amongst the little <lb/>
community in which he lived. His wife was a <lb/>
woman of sterling piety, whose faith in God's <reg orig="pro-|mises">promises</reg> <lb/>
was so strong that she frequently devoted <lb/>
whole days to interceding with God for her children. <lb/>
It was surely in answer to her devout and trusting <lb/>
prayers that, in 1857, the descendants of this pious <lb/>
woman numbered three hundred&mdash;all members of <lb/>
Christian churches!</p>
<p>The son of this excellent man and his praying <lb/>
wife was Ebenezer Fiske, a man of fine appearance <lb/>
<pb n="74" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0081"/>
and of rare Christian character and integrity. His <lb/>
wife was remarkable for activity and undisturbed <lb/>
temper. On the first day of May 1816, they were <lb/>
made happy by the birth of a little girl&mdash;Fidelia <lb/>
Fiske, whose subsequent life amongst the Persian <lb/>
girls has been so eminently blessed. Her home in <lb/>
which she spent her early years was an <reg orig="unpretend-|ing">unpretending</reg> <lb/>
one-story farm-house, one room in which served <lb/>
as kitchen, nursery, dining and sitting room. The <lb/>
evenings were pleasantly devoted to work&mdash;sewing, <lb/>
knitting, reading, and study, with an occasional story <lb/>
of the old days; then, when the hour for retiring had <lb/>
come, the big Bible would be opened and a chapter <lb/>
reverently read, and a fervent prayer offered. And <lb/>
so life passed usefully and unvaryingly in the young <lb/>
girl's mountain home. Fidelia was early noted for <lb/>
thoughtfulness, quick observation, and ready <reg orig="acquisi-|tion">acquisition</reg> <lb/>
and retention of knowledge. From her fourth <lb/>
to her fourteenth year she was sent to the district <lb/>
school, where she readily acquired all that was <lb/>
taught. The characteristic of her life, thoroughness, <lb/>
was developed in her school days. She early learned <lb/>
to do well whatever she undertook. Another trait <lb/>
of her character, self-reliance, was uniformly <reg orig="mani-|fested">manifested</reg> <lb/>
in her school days. She was never satisfied <lb/>
unless she thoroughly understood and mastered her <lb/>
lessons. At the school examinations she was the one <lb/>
little girl that distanced all the other scholars.</p>
<p>But Fidelia had also early learned that she was a <lb/>
<pb n="75" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0082"/>
sinner, and that Christ was a Saviour. In her <lb/>
thirteenth year, impressed by the words of her <lb/>
Sabbath-school teacher, she poured her sorrow into <lb/>
the ear of her parent. "Mother," she said, "I am a <lb/>
lost sinner." Gently but earnestly was she pointed <lb/>
to the Saviour: then the peace which passes human <lb/>
knowledge became and remained her life-long <reg orig="pos-|session">possession</reg>. <lb/>
On the 12th of July 1831, Fidelia made a <lb/>
public profession of her faith in Christ, and became <lb/>
a member of the Church. Then, having secured her <lb/>
own salvation, she was earnestly concerned for the <lb/>
salvation of her little friends. Having become a <lb/>
Sunday-school teacher, a work which was in every <lb/>
way congenial to her tastes and desires, she was <lb/>
much concerned in caring for the souls and spiritual <lb/>
interests of her scholars. She was not content to <lb/>
enjoy alone the blessings which come from believing; <lb/>
the little ones around her must also share in her <lb/>
happiness.</p>
<p>In 1839 it was resolved that Fidelia should enter <lb/>
upon another sphere. Her parents wisely resolved <lb/>
that she should complete her education in Mount <lb/>
Holyoke Seminary, where the good Miss Lyon ruled <lb/>
lovingly but firmly. This arrangement was exactly <lb/>
suited to the mental and spiritual yearnings of <lb/>
Fidelia. Religious duties and spiritual instruction <lb/>
went hand in hand with mental training. One day <lb/>
was entirely devoted to prayer, when the young <lb/>
people were urged to examine their own hearts, and <lb/>
<pb n="76" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0083"/>
join in the prayers of their companions for their <reg orig="sal-|vation">salvation</reg>. <lb/>
There was ever about the school a blessed <lb/>
atmosphere, which made labour light, and which <lb/>
urged to a vigorous and an earnest life. When, <lb/>
however, the first year of her seminary career closed, <lb/>
the institution was visited with a malignant form of <lb/>
typhus fever. In order to remove her from the <reg orig="con-|tagion">contagion</reg> <lb/>
she returned home, but only two days <reg orig="after-|wards">afterwards</reg> <lb/>
to be seized with the disorder. It was <lb/>
supposed that her illness would be unto death; but <lb/>
by God's gracious providence she was gradually <lb/>
restored to health.</p>
<p>This terrible illness was much blessed to Miss <lb/>
Fiske. She never forgot the experience she then <lb/>
learned&mdash;the feelings and necessities of the sick. <lb/>
From that season death to her had no terrors. She <lb/>
could hardly persuade herself that she had not passed <lb/>
the confines of the other world: this she was ever <lb/>
confident of, that her Saviour had met her when <lb/>
she thought she was about to depart and assured her <lb/>
of his love. But these were not the only lessons <lb/>
which she was then called to learn. The fever from <lb/>
which she had successfully struggled seized her <lb/>
father and her youngest sister, and speedily carried <lb/>
them from their earthly home. She had the <reg orig="happi-|ness">happiness</reg> <lb/>
to know, however, that they both died rejoicing <lb/>
in the love of the Saviour. Now, however, instead <lb/>
of returning to her much-desired studies, she had to <lb/>
undertake needful home duties, and to learn further, <lb/>
<pb n="77" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0084"/>
in the school of affliction, those needful lessons which <lb/>
would be of so much use to her in her after life. In <lb/>
the autumn of the following year she again found <lb/>
herself at Mount Holyoke, where, after graduating, <lb/>
she became a teacher.</p>
<p>Then came the great crisis of her life, occasioned <lb/>
by a visit of Dr. Perkins, author of "Eight Years' <lb/>
Residence in Persia," to the seminary, for the purpose <lb/>
of obtaining a missionary teacher to go out with him <lb/>
to Persia. Fidelia was induced to write the doctor a <lb/>
note: "If counted worthy, I should be willing to go," <lb/>
&mdash;little knowing how much that willingness involved, <lb/>
and what sacrifices would have to be made. Her <lb/>
mother, yearning towards her daughter, had many <lb/>
objections, chiefly on the ground of her daughter's <lb/>
health. It was at length arranged that another <lb/>
teacher should be chosen, and that Fidelia should <lb/>
remain at the seminary. But Fidelia, who <reg orig="acknow-|ledged">acknowledged</reg> <lb/>
and bowed to the call of duty, was not at rest. <lb/>
She passed a sleepless night revolving in her mind <lb/>
what her Saviour would have her to do. <reg orig="Notwith-|standing">Notwithstanding</reg> <lb/>
that it was supposed all was settled, and <lb/>
that she was not to go to Persia, she opened her <lb/>
heart to Miss Lyon, stating her doubts that she was <lb/>
not following the leading of Providence. "If such <lb/>
are your feelings," said Miss Lyon, "we will go and <lb/>
see your mother and sisters." In an hour afterwards <lb/>
they were on their way: a thirty miles' drive in an <lb/>
open sleigh on a cold winter's Saturday showed their <lb/>
<pb n="78" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0085"/>
earnestness. After the sleigh had been several times <lb/>
upset, they arrived at Fidelia's home at eleven o'clock <lb/>
at night, when all were in bed.</p>
<p>When the mission of the travellers was understood <lb/>
many tears were shed at the thought of parting. <lb/>
There was little sleep in that humble dwelling <reg orig="dur-|ing">during</reg> <lb/>
that night. On the next day, the Sabbath, long <lb/>
and solemn conferences were held in the intervals of <lb/>
service. Before the day closed the mother was <reg orig="en-|abled">enabled</reg> <lb/>
to say with serious cheerfulness: "Go, my <lb/>
child, go." Then there was nothing to be done but <lb/>
at once to prepare for the long journey. The <reg orig="in-|mates">inmates</reg> <lb/>
of the school were all employed in preparing <lb/>
a suitable outfit, which was truly a labour of love. <lb/>
Then, when the last day of Fidelia's stay at the <lb/>
seminary had come, a service was conducted by the <lb/>
pastor of the village church in the afternoon: in the <lb/>
evening she delivered a last earnest address to the <lb/>
teachers and pupils. One who was privileged to be <lb/>
present said, "Shall we ever forget how affectionately <lb/>
she implored her sisters in Christ to live faithfully <lb/>
for him? how tenderly she entreated the <reg orig="im-|penitent">impenitent</reg> <lb/>
to listen to mercy's call? Shall we forget <lb/>
the tones of that voice which had so often led us in <lb/>
our devotions, as she once more commended us to her <lb/>
God and our God? But that hallowed hour passed <lb/>
away, and a sadder one came. It was the parting <lb/>
hour, and we gathered around to bid her a last adieu. <lb/>
She wept not herself, but smiled sweetly, and said, <lb/>
<pb n="79" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0086"/>
'When all life's work is done we shall meet again;' <lb/>
but tears and stifled sobs were our only reply. Sadly <lb/>
and silently we went away, yet turned to gaze once <lb/>
more on the form we might never see again." At <lb/>
two o'clock next morning she was on her way to <lb/>
Boston, at which port she was to embark.</p>
<p>Several missionaries accompanied Dr. Perkins to <lb/>
Persia on board the <hi rend="italic">Emma Isadora</hi>, in which the <lb/>
voyage was made. Fidelia's chief employment on <lb/>
board was to perfect herself in the Persian language, <lb/>
in which she subsequently became very proficient. <lb/>
On arriving at Constantinople, three weeks had to <lb/>
be spent in preparation&mdash;in accumulating all <reg orig="avail-|able">available</reg> <lb/>
information that might be useful in the projected <lb/>
work. From Constantinople the travellers proceeded <lb/>
by sea to Trebizond, and then entered upon a journey <lb/>
by land of eight hundred miles through an unsettled <lb/>
mountainous country, infested with robbers, and poorly <lb/>
furnished with resting-places for travellers. The <lb/>
journey was, however, safely accomplished. When <lb/>
at Seir, in Asia, she received the joyful intelligence <lb/>
that sixty young ladies who were unconverted when <lb/>
she left Mount Holyoke were now rejoicing in the <lb/>
smiles of a loving Saviour.</p>
<p>The town in which Miss Fiske's labours <reg orig="com-|menced">commenced</reg> <lb/>
was Oroomiah, containing twenty-five <reg orig="thou-|sand">thousand</reg> <lb/>
inhabitants, of whom nine hundred were <reg orig="Nes-|torians">Nestorians</reg>, <lb/>
two thousand Jews, and the rest <reg orig="Moham-|medans">Mohammedans</reg>. <lb/>
The domestic condition of the Nestorians <lb/>
<pb n="80" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0087"/>
was most pitiable and degrading. One room served <lb/>
all purposes&mdash;for eating and sleeping, young and old, <lb/>
male and female. The women were regarded by the <lb/>
men as drudges and slaves: they spent most of their <lb/>
time in outdoor labour; and when on returning in <lb/>
the evening, however weary, they had first to milk <lb/>
the cow and prepare their husbands' supper, and <lb/>
wait until they had finished their meal before resting <lb/>
or partaking themselves. The husbands universally <lb/>
beat their wives. Lying was the common habit of <lb/>
both the men and women. The children of both <lb/>
sexes would swear and use the vilest language, <reg orig="call-|ing">calling</reg> <lb/>
each other <hi rend="italic">buffaloes, donkeys</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">devils</hi>. They <lb/>
pleaded that if they did not use the name of God <lb/>
very often they would not be believed. The women <lb/>
were deeply degraded&mdash;coarse, passionate, and <reg orig="quarrel-|some">quarrelsome</reg>, <lb/>
and were to be seen frequently engaged in <lb/>
throwing stones, brickbats, and spoiled eggs at each <lb/>
other, uttering at the same time almost unearthly <lb/>
shrieks. They were not only ignorant, but were proud <lb/>
of their ignorance. When asked if they would not <lb/>
like to learn to read, they would reply: "I am a <lb/>
woman," or, "I am a girl;" "Do you want to make <lb/>
a priest of me?" Schools had previously been <reg orig="estab-|lished">established</reg> <lb/>
by the American missionaries, and the gospel <lb/>
had been preached in the villages on the plain of <lb/>
Oroomiah. Very few girls could be induced to <lb/>
attend the schools, which were of a mixed character. <lb/>
Mrs. Grant, however, a lady of indefatigable zeal in <lb/>
<pb n="81" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0088"/>
missionary work, opened a school exclusively for <lb/>
girls in the March of 1838. After her death, which <lb/>
occurred in 1839, the school was continued by any <lb/>
help which could be obtained, and remained as a <reg orig="day-|school">day-school</reg>. <lb/>
Miss Fiske at once saw that little good could <lb/>
be done towards the moral improvement of the girls <lb/>
while they were half their time under the influence <lb/>
of home habits. But the difficulties of obtaining <lb/>
half a dozen girls as boarders seemed <reg orig="insurmount-|able">insurmountable</reg>. <lb/>
The parents were afraid that by being <reg orig="con-|stantly">constantly</reg> <lb/>
at school they would lose some favourable <lb/>
opportunity of marriage; and then, as the girls were <lb/>
neither to be priests nor deacons, what was the use <lb/>
of so much study? Two little girls, however, were <lb/>
obtained as a commencement; finally the desired <lb/>
number of six was obtained. Before any lessons or <lb/>
teaching, the little ones had to be washed and literally <lb/>
cleansed from filth, and then to be cured, if it were <lb/>
possible, of the inveterate habit of lying. Miss Fiske <lb/>
had to undertake all the duties of housekeeper as <lb/>
well as teacher. It was only the intense love which <lb/>
she had in her heart for the girls that subdued the <lb/>
discomforts of her position. But engrossed as she <lb/>
was with the various duties of the school, she found <lb/>
some little time daily to pay visits to the poor <reg orig="Nes-|torian">Nestorian</reg> <lb/>
women in the city, to whom she carried the <lb/>
blessed message of Christ's gospel.</p>
<p>As the women would not attend the public service <lb/>
on the Sabbath&mdash;it being considered improper for <lb/>
<pb n="82" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0089"/>
women to join in a public assembly with men&mdash;Miss <lb/>
Fiske induced some of them to go to her room at the <lb/>
same hour as the public service, when she prayed and <lb/>
read the Scriptures with them. Afterwards one of <lb/>
the missionaries was permitted to conduct the service, <lb/>
and the women were by this means prepared to join <lb/>
in the mixed congregation. Miss Fiske, however, <lb/>
found ample opportunity for usefulness in going <lb/>
from house to house, though their dirty state would <lb/>
have repelled any over-sensitive female. She <reg orig="fre-|quently">frequently</reg>, <lb/>
also, extended her visits to the <reg orig="neighbour-|ing">neighbouring</reg> <lb/>
villages, where news of her coming had <reg orig="pre-|ceded">preceded</reg> <lb/>
her. The inhabitants would fill one of the <lb/>
dwellings until they almost trod one upon another. <lb/>
"Now we are all here," they would say; "will you <lb/>
preach to us a little?" Upon one occasion, visiting <lb/>
the village of Ardishai, about twelve miles from <lb/>
Oroomiah, she was induced to preach, or talk, to <lb/>
about five hundred women and children, who, <reg orig="unfor-|tunately">unfortunately</reg>, <lb/>
would talk also, so that she could not be <lb/>
heard. Requesting them to place their fingers upon <lb/>
their lips, which request was complied with, she <lb/>
induced them for a little while to be silent, and to <lb/>
hear her read and speak.</p>
<p>In the year 1844 Miss Fiske had to meet and <lb/>
endure persecution. Owing to the mission declining <lb/>
to support the brothers of the Nestorian patriarch, <lb/>
who exhibited a haughty and overbearing spirit, they <lb/>
vowed vengeance against the missionaries. Their <lb/>
<pb n="83" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0090"/>
first act was to demand that the teachers' school at <lb/>
Seir should be disbanded, and that the teachers should <lb/>
appear before them at the city. Those who remained <lb/>
in the school were threatened with excommunication <lb/>
from the Nestorian Church. One of the natives said <lb/>
in reply to the threat, "I fear not the curses of men; <lb/>
they are, I trust, my Father's blessings." Again the <lb/>
threatenings were repeated in these words: "Know <lb/>
ye, all ye readers at Seir, if you do not come to us <reg orig="to-|morrow">to-morrow</reg>, <lb/>
we will excommunicate you from our Holy <lb/>
Church; your finger nails shall be torn out; we will <lb/>
hunt you from village to village, and kill you if we <lb/>
can." The brave natives who had tasted of the joy of <lb/>
believing said: "We fear not what man can do to us."</p>
<p>It was thought advisable that the children should <lb/>
return to their homes until the persecution ceased, <lb/>
for fear that the little ones might be injured. The <lb/>
leave-taking of these endeared girls was an almost <lb/>
insupportable trial. Miss Fiske wrote: "It seems as <lb/>
if death had been in the midst of us." It seemed as <lb/>
though the threatenings of the patriarchal family <lb/>
would be carried out, and that the mission would be <lb/>
destroyed. All the children attending the schools <lb/>
were sent home, and the schools were closed. At <lb/>
this juncture the Russian ambassador at Teheran <lb/>
interposed, and succeeded in obtaining a continuance <lb/>
of the mission. Miss Fiske, after much <reg orig="despond-|ency">despondency</reg>, <lb/>
had again the pleasure to receive her dear girls <lb/>
into her school, twenty of whom were boarders. Soon <lb/>
<pb n="84" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0091"/>
afterwards she wrote: "I have now twenty-five little <lb/>
girls, all under thirteen years. They are a great <lb/>
charge, often wayward, and causing my inmost soul <lb/>
to weep; and yet I have so much to encourage me <lb/>
that I am far from sinking. I have as an assistant <lb/>
a Nestorian deacon, who magnifies his deaconship by <lb/>
his faithfulness, and is, I hope, a true Christian." <lb/>
Her labours were incessant: she had to care for the <lb/>
poor children's cleanliness when they returned from <lb/>
their homes; to see to the preparation of the food, <lb/>
and the repairing of their clothes; to be with them <lb/>
on retiring to sleep and when they awoke; to <reg orig="pre-|pare">prepare</reg> <lb/>
and give them their lessons; to read the Bible, <lb/>
and impress its truths upon their minds. Yet in all <lb/>
these labours, when there was no hour during the <lb/>
day she could call her own, she wrote: "I am <reg orig="com-|forted">comforted</reg> <lb/>
by the thought that Jesus has been in just <lb/>
such homes, and blessed their little ones. How much <lb/>
more he felt these things than I can feel them! I <lb/>
love to rest in this thought when a new child is <lb/>
brought to me, and when I am wandering in the <lb/>
lanes of our city."</p>
<p>Miss Fiske had now been two years away from her <lb/>
American home, and although at times she was <reg orig="dis-|posed">disposed</reg> <lb/>
to despond, yet on then looking back she had <lb/>
much cause to write to her mother: "Surely <reg orig="good-|ness">goodness</reg> <lb/>
and mercy have followed my every step." She <lb/>
had the happiness to know the intense desire that <lb/>
the mothers of the children entertained that their <lb/>
<pb n="85" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0092"/>
daughters should be brought up under her care; and <lb/>
the further blessed knowledge that the children had <lb/>
begun to manifest an interest in the Saviour's death <lb/>
and in the gracious work of the Spirit. The poor <lb/>
careless mothers, also, had learned something of the <lb/>
gospel message. Instead of their conversation, as <lb/>
formerly, being wholly taken up with dress, many of <lb/>
them desired to hear the word of God read to them, <lb/>
and to talk about their souls. One immediate result <lb/>
of Miss Fiske's labours was the enlargement of the <lb/>
school; and in the winter of 1845 a genuine revival <lb/>
of religion was manifested amongst the children. <lb/>
Delightfully sweet was it to hear the prayers uttered <lb/>
by the children, the last sounds that came from their <lb/>
sleeping-rooms at night, many of them manifesting a <lb/>
real concern for their salvation. On the first day <lb/>
of 1846, which was observed as a day of fasting and <lb/>
prayer by the friends of the school, two of the little <lb/>
girls went to Miss Fiske and whispered, "May we <lb/>
have a day to care for our souls?" As there was <lb/>
no other place to which they could retire, they spent <lb/>
that cold winter's day in the wood cellar, asking for <lb/>
the forgiveness of their sins. They were, however, <lb/>
soon rejoicing in the love of Christ. This was but <lb/>
the commencement of a general spiritual awakening <lb/>
amongst the children. The first week of the new <lb/>
year was a week of continued prayer by the children; <lb/>
and for three weeks succeeding the school seemed to <lb/>
enjoy a continual Sabbath. The mothers of the <reg orig="chil-|dren">children</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="86" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0093"/>
also caught the interest, and would know some of <lb/>
the joy which filled the school. Ten or fifteen women <lb/>
would frequently pass the night on any spare cushions, <lb/>
pillows, or quilts, which could be gathered in the <lb/>
sitting-room. These poor women would frequently <lb/>
be heard praying the whole night. It was glad news <lb/>
to send to the far-off Mount Holyoke, where the dear <lb/>
and loved Fidelia was so often remembered in the <lb/>
prayers of the teachers and scholars.</p>
<p>It was not only the children who were blessed in <lb/>
the gracious awakening: some priests, who had <reg orig="previ-|ously">previously</reg> <lb/>
been intemperate and profane, were found now <lb/>
humbly sitting at the feet of Jesus. Many of the <lb/>
most ignorant labouring men became earnest and <lb/>
inquiring Christians. While working in the fields <lb/>
they sang and prayed, until, as Miss Fiske wrote, <lb/>
"the fields and vineyards were made vocal with their <lb/>
prayers and praises."</p>
<p>During the year, the awful cholera pestilence had <lb/>
gradually been approaching Oroomiah, where, <reg orig="ow-|ing">owing</reg> <lb/>
to the very dirty condition of the dwellings, it <lb/>
found many ready victims. More than two thousand <lb/>
three hundred died in the city, or nearly one-tenth <lb/>
of the population. The schools had to be closed, <lb/>
and the teachers and the missionaries to remove to <lb/>
the mountains, where work was found them in <reg orig="minis-|tering">ministering</reg> <lb/>
to the poor Nestorians who had been driven <lb/>
from their homes by the Koords. Both the children <lb/>
and the teachers were mercifully permitted again to <lb/>
<pb n="87" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0094"/>
meet in their dearly loved school, where, with hearts <lb/>
overflowing with gratitude, they again sought and <lb/>
found a fresh revival of the Holy Spirit's power. <lb/>
The religious life of the children was not manifested <lb/>
merely in religious enthusiasm&mdash;in the delightful <lb/>
school exercises of praise and prayer: at home they <lb/>
were characterized by sweet submission and the <lb/>
faithful performance of every family duty.</p>
<p>The many duties which now devolved upon Miss <lb/>
Fiske rendered it absolutely needful that she should <lb/>
have assistance. In the November of 1847, she was <lb/>
gladdened by the arrival of Miss Mary Susan Rice, <lb/>
a willing and a happy worker, of whom she wrote: <lb/>
"I am much pleased with my new companion. I <lb/>
love her more and more every hour. I feel she is <lb/>
just the one to come here. The girls are delighted <lb/>
with their new teacher, and well they may be. I <lb/>
believe she is one of heaven's choicest spirits." For <lb/>
eleven years these two noble women sweetly and <lb/>
affectionately worked together in the duties of the <lb/>
mission. How hard the work was! and that it was <lb/>
real work, demanding pains and laborious effort, we <lb/>
learn from an extract from one of Miss Fiske's letters: <lb/>
"Our girls always sew in the forenoon of this day <lb/>
&lsqb;Saturday&rsqb;, and the afternoon is given to <reg orig="prepara-|tions">preparations</reg> <lb/>
for the Sabbath. To-day has been a busy day, <lb/>
and my poor head asks rest. We have had meetings <lb/>
with the scholars this evening. I met with those <lb/>
who hope they are Christians, and Miss Rice with <lb/>
<pb n="88" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0095"/>
those who have no hope. Several, who had hoped <lb/>
to be the Lord's, were constrained to-night to take <lb/>
their places with the impenitent. They said that if <lb/>
they were Christians they needed a new repentance. <lb/>
May it be given to them." On the 23rd November <lb/>
1848 she wrote: "I tried yesterday to fill up every <lb/>
moment with some work of the hand or head. All <lb/>
my spare time I spent in writing. The effect of <lb/>
such constant employment has been a rather severe <lb/>
touch of neuralgia to-day. I find it impossible to <lb/>
work all the time. I wish I could, especially as I do <lb/>
not like to have the girls ever see me unemployed. <lb/>
But I sometimes feel so exhausted that I cannot bear <lb/>
even to take my knitting; and as I have no <reg orig="inclina-|tion">inclination</reg> <lb/>
to sleep, I often take a little rest, sitting quite <lb/>
still. This soon restores my weary nature to its <lb/>
usual vigour."</p>
<p>The year 1849 was a memorable year in the <lb/>
spiritual progress of the children, and the parents of <lb/>
the children; for neither Miss Fiske nor Miss Rice <lb/>
considered her work confined to the school. From <lb/>
the 1st of January to the 29th of the same month <lb/>
the school was a house of prayer;&mdash;the children, <lb/>
convinced of sin, sought the Saviour with longing, <lb/>
ardent, trusting faith; and the mothers by scores <lb/>
would leave their home duties and sit down in the <lb/>
school in tearful silence to learn the way to heaven. <lb/>
Many were the delightful incidents which resulted <lb/>
in whole families being joined together in the <lb/>
<pb n="89" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0096"/>
Saviour. And then their own anxiety would be <lb/>
turned to anxiety for relatives and friends. One <lb/>
poor fellow, Joseph, who came from Degala, a village <lb/>
which he called the Sodom of the Nestorians, when <lb/>
he had received the blessing of peace, cried, "My <lb/>
village is lost, my family are going to destruction, <lb/>
and their blood is on my neck. Oh! <hi rend="italic">will</hi> you let <lb/>
me go to-night and tell them their state, and ask <lb/>
their forgiveness for my soul-destroying example." <lb/>
Very soon the voice of prayer and praise was heard <lb/>
in Degala. Soon the poor depressed women found <lb/>
their way to the schools, where they would spend <lb/>
the Friday and the Sabbath. They would bring <lb/>
their babies with them; and as they sat to eat their <lb/>
food from a cloth on the floor, one of the school-girls <lb/>
would address them on their eternal interests. The <lb/>
girl selected for the duty, said Miss Fiske, "does it <lb/>
with streaming eyes, and with the tenderness of one <lb/>
before whose vision eternal realities are vividly set <lb/>
forth. The listeners, with sighs and sobs, attempt to <lb/>
eat, but frequently stop, feeling they have no need <lb/>
of anything but the <hi rend="italic">bread of life</hi>."</p>
<p>Many were the delightful incidents of the religious <lb/>
revival among the scholars. One day the <hi rend="italic">malek</hi>, or <lb/>
mayor, of Geog Tapa, called to see his daughter, who <lb/>
was in the school. Impressed with the necessity <lb/>
that he also should become a Christian, she <reg orig="com-|menced">commenced</reg> <lb/>
to pray for him; then, calling in <reg orig="half-a-|dozen">half-a-dozen</reg> <lb/>
of her companions, they formed a ring round <lb/>
<pb n="90" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0097"/>
the proud man as he sat in his chair. Presently his <lb/>
feelings were so overcome by the earnest, importunate <lb/>
prayers of the dear girls, that he fell down on the <lb/>
floor and joined his prayers to theirs, weeping like a <lb/>
child. It was not long before he realized the truth <lb/>
of God's promise, that <hi rend="italic">whosoever will may come</hi> and <lb/>
take of the water of life freely. The rest of the life <lb/>
of this true penitent was spent in aiding the objects <lb/>
of the mission. In 1863 he went to the heavenly <lb/>
rest, rejoicing in a joy unspeakable.</p>
<p>It was a great trial to Miss Fiske when she had to <lb/>
part with any of her dear girls. Three girls had <lb/>
been left at the door of the seminary by their parents, <lb/>
who were fleeing from the terrible massacre of 1843. <lb/>
Their parents had asked for charity, and instead of <lb/>
silver and gold, a home was offered for the three <lb/>
girls, Sarah, Nazee, and Helenah, who became <reg orig="dili-|gent">diligent</reg> <lb/>
and interesting scholars. When the revival <lb/>
broke out, they all became Christians,&mdash;earnest, <lb/>
pious girls, who subsequently carried the aroma of <lb/>
the gospel to their mountain home in Koordistan. <lb/>
When the time of their departure had come, the <lb/>
whole school assembled for a last prayer and a last <lb/>
look at their loved sisters. Then, before departing, <lb/>
they wished to take a few moments' farewell of their <lb/>
closets! When the last moments had come all knelt <lb/>
down, and by joining hands pledged themselves to <lb/>
remember the Tiary sisters in every prayer. As <lb/>
they left they could only utter the words, "The <lb/>
<pb n="91" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0098"/>
promise&mdash;the promise!" and that promise was <reg orig="faith-|fully">faithfully</reg> <lb/>
kept. Was not the effect seen years after, when <lb/>
native missionaries found the dear girls full of the <lb/>
Saviour's love?</p>
<p>Miss Fiske was most solicitous that the girls <lb/>
should acquire industrious habits. On the Saturdays <lb/>
they were up at a very early hour, washing dishes, <lb/>
cleaning knives, rubbing candlesticks, sweeping, <lb/>
bringing wood, washing towels, making fires, etc. <lb/>
All this had to be done before eight o'clock in the <lb/>
morning. Then all would be assembled in the <reg orig="school-|room">schoolroom</reg>, <lb/>
in their wash-room dresses, with clothes-bag <lb/>
and soap, prepared to commence the business of <lb/>
washing their own clothes. The girls, taught to be <lb/>
active, would have all done before noon, when they <lb/>
were again assembled to comb and braid their hair. <lb/>
This done, all would sit down to sew and knit, and <lb/>
prepare lessons for the afternoon. After dinner, when <lb/>
the plates and dishes were washed and put away, all <lb/>
would again sit down to sew. At half-past three, <lb/>
all would again assemble, to give an account of their <lb/>
work, to receive the lessons for the Sabbath, and to <lb/>
join in singing a few hymns, which would close the <lb/>
work for the week.</p>
<p>Useful as the work was in which Miss Fiske was <lb/>
engaged, it had its enemies. Owing probably to <lb/>
misrepresentations, the Persian Government <reg orig="inti-|mated">intimated</reg> <lb/>
the intention to close the school, when Miss <lb/>
Fiske wrote to R. W. Stephens, Esq., the British <lb/>
<pb n="92" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0099"/>
consul at Teheran, informing him of the character of <lb/>
the work and the object of the school. She wrote: <lb/>
"The design of the school is to so educate Nestorian <lb/>
girls that they may be better daughters and sisters, <lb/>
wives and mothers, than are those usually found <lb/>
among the people. Unless a change, and a very <lb/>
great change, can be wrought in the females here, all <lb/>
the efforts in behalf of the other sex will fail of <reg orig="pro-|ducing">producing</reg> <lb/>
permanent good. We aim to give the <lb/>
members of the school such a training, physical, <lb/>
mental, and moral, as shall best fit them for a happy <lb/>
and useful life among their own people. Aside from <lb/>
the various duties of the schoolroom, kitchen, and <lb/>
wash-room, the pupils are taught to cut and make <lb/>
their own clothing. They also give attention to <lb/>
other plain needlework, and ply their knitting <reg orig="when-|ever">whenever</reg> <lb/>
they find a few leisure moments. Some <reg orig="orna-|mental">ornamental</reg> <lb/>
needlework is taught the older girls. This <lb/>
has not a very prominent place in our instructions, <lb/>
though we deem it important. It tends not a little <lb/>
to soften the asperities of these wild girls. The <lb/>
same hand, however, that skilfully uses the <reg orig="worsted-|needle">worsted-needle</reg> <lb/>
is found in summer among the golden wheat <lb/>
holding the sickle, and in autumn gathering the <lb/>
vintage."</p>
<p>To have stopped work of so much usefulness <lb/>
would have been folly and wickedness. The effect <lb/>
of the school training upon the girls, brought up <lb/>
amid the grossest ignorance intemperance, <reg orig="profane-|ness">profaneness</reg>, <lb/>
<pb n="93" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0100"/>
dirt, lying, and stealing, was to convert them <lb/>
into human beings&mdash;orderly, refined, cultured, <reg orig="benev-|olent">benevolent</reg>, <lb/>
and domesticated. Better counsels prevailed, <lb/>
and the school was not closed; on the contrary, a large <lb/>
addition was made to it, well fitted to increase the <lb/>
usefulness and comfort of the institution.</p>
<p>Only a few days of the year 1850 had passed <lb/>
before there were indications of a spiritual revival <lb/>
amongst the children. On the Sabbath evening, <lb/>
January 13, Miss Fiske was assured on passing the <lb/>
rooms occupied by the children, who were heard in <lb/>
earnest supplication, that her heavenly Father was <lb/>
about to send them abundant blessings. The week <lb/>
following, when the girls had performed their <reg orig="accus-|tomed">accustomed</reg> <lb/>
duties, was spent by them in the retirement <lb/>
of their own rooms, earnestly pleading for spiritual <lb/>
blessings at a throne of grace. They gave evidence <lb/>
in their subsequent lives that these petitions were <lb/>
not offered in vain. Many were the delightful <reg orig="meet-|ings">meetings</reg> <lb/>
of the teacher and the scholars, when the girls <lb/>
sought and obtained the peace which passes <reg orig="under-|standing">understanding</reg>. <lb/>
Miss Fiske looked back to these holy <lb/>
hours as a sweet foretaste of that heaven to which <lb/>
she was fast hastening.</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1856, the Persian Government, <lb/>
urged on by the enemies of Christianity, tried to <lb/>
break up the school. The agent, Askar Khan, <lb/>
visited the establishment with the evident <reg orig="inten-|tion">intention</reg> <lb/>
of discovering a sufficient reason for its <reg orig="destruc-|tion">destruction</reg>. <lb/>
<pb n="94" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0101"/>
Many were the questions put to the children, <lb/>
in the hope of discovering that they were improperly <lb/>
trained. The open and frank replies which he <reg orig="re-|ceived">received</reg>, <lb/>
and the excellent training which was <reg orig="im-|parted">imparted</reg> <lb/>
in the school, made it impossible to give an <lb/>
unfavourable report.</p>
<p>But all this work was telling upon the health of <lb/>
Miss Fiske. When very weak, and almost <reg orig="despond-|ing">desponding</reg>, <lb/>
an incident occurred which gave her new life <lb/>
and vigour. Writing to a friend, she said: "I have <lb/>
learned here, as I never did in America, that He who <lb/>
fed the five thousand with the portion of five, can <lb/>
feed the soul, and richly feed it too, with what I once <lb/>
thought were <hi rend="italic">only the crumbs</hi>. May I give you one <lb/>
of the Master's sermons? A few Sabbaths since, I <lb/>
went to Geog Tapa with Mr. Stoddard. It was <lb/>
afternoon, and I was sitting on a mat near the middle <lb/>
of the church, which has no seats, and only a floor of <lb/>
earth. I had been to two exercises before going to <lb/>
the church, one the Sabbath school, and the other a <lb/>
prayer-meeting with my girls. I was weary, and <lb/>
longed for rest, and with no support, it seemed to me <lb/>
that I could not sit there till the close of the service. <lb/>
Nor could I hope for rest even when that was over; <lb/>
for I must meet the women readers of the village, <lb/>
and encourage them in reading their Testaments. I <lb/>
thought how I should love to be in your church, but <lb/>
God took the thought from me very soon; for, <reg orig="find-|ing">finding</reg> <lb/>
that there was some one directly behind me, I <lb/>
<pb n="95" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0102"/>
looked, and there was one of the sisters who had <lb/>
seated herself so that I might lean upon her. I <reg orig="ob-|jected">objected</reg>; <lb/>
but she drew me back to the firm support <lb/>
she could give, saying, '<hi rend="italic">If you love me, you will lean <lb/>
hard</hi>.' Did I not then lean hard! And then there <lb/>
came the Master's <hi rend="italic">own</hi> voice, 'If you love <hi rend="italic">Me</hi>, you <lb/>
will lean hard;' and I leaned on <hi rend="italic">him</hi> too, and felt <lb/>
that he had sent the poor woman to give me a better <lb/>
sermon than I might have heard even with you. I <lb/>
was rested long before the church services were <lb/>
finished; and I afterwards had a long hour with the <lb/>
women readers, and closed with prayer. A little <lb/>
after sunset we left, to ride six miles to our home. <lb/>
I was surprised to find that I was not at all weary <lb/>
that night, nor in the morning; and I have rested <lb/>
ever since, remembering the sweet words, '<hi rend="small-caps">If you <lb/>
love Me, lean hard</hi>!'"</p>
<p>It was evident, however, that if the valued life <lb/>
of Miss Fiske was to be preserved, she must for a <lb/>
season seek re&iuml;nvigoration in her native land. This <lb/>
was a great trial to her, as she would thus be <reg orig="com-|pelled">compelled</reg> <lb/>
to leave the work and the dear girls that she <lb/>
loved so ardently. For the few months preceding <lb/>
her departure she was continually furnished with <lb/>
proofs of the permanence of the work in which she <lb/>
was engaged. At an experience meeting, when those <lb/>
who were present were urged to tell of their joys <lb/>
and sorrows, Khanee, one of the two little girls first <lb/>
received by Miss Fiske into the school, and who <lb/>
<pb n="96" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0103"/>
had recently buried her only child, raised her arms, <lb/>
as if still holding her little one, and said: "Sisters, <lb/>
four months ago you saw me here with my babe in <lb/>
my arms. It is not here now; I have laid it into <lb/>
Jesus' arms. I have come to-day to tell you that <lb/>
there is a sweet as well as a bitter in affliction. <lb/>
When the rod is laid upon us, let us not only kiss it <lb/>
but press it to our lips. When I stood by that little <lb/>
open grave, I said, 'All the time I have given to my <lb/>
babe I will give to souls. I have tried to do so. <lb/>
Pray for me that I may be faithful.'" One after <lb/>
another of the dear girls and women gave joyful <lb/>
testimony of the blessedness of the religious life, of <lb/>
its sustaining power in trials and afflictions, and the <lb/>
heart - gladness which it communicates. The last <lb/>
services in which Miss Fiske engaged with her pupils <lb/>
were truly glad seasons of refreshing from the <lb/>
presence of the Most High. On the morning of her <lb/>
departure, seventy of her pupils gathered about her <lb/>
soliciting "one more prayer-meeting." When she <lb/>
told them that she could not lead their devotions, <lb/>
they replied that "they would carry her that day." <lb/>
Six prayers were offered, all simply tender and <reg orig="com-|forting">comforting</reg>. <lb/>
Many were the letters sent after her to <lb/>
America, recording the love and affection of these <lb/>
dear Nestorian girls.</p>
<p>On her arrival in America, the friendships of the <lb/>
past were re&ouml;pened. Old people threw their arms <lb/>
around her neck, weeping tears of joy; young men <lb/>
<pb n="97" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0104"/>
and women, who were children when she left, <reg orig="re-|membered">remembered</reg> <lb/>
her words of kindness and affectionate <lb/>
endearments. She was immediately importuned to <lb/>
meet numerous Bible classes&mdash;a call to which she <lb/>
willingly responded; and eternity only will declare <lb/>
the value of her labours at Holyoke Seminary, <lb/>
Oxford, Painesville, and Ohio. At Montreal she was <lb/>
invited to visit Miss Lyman's school. On leaving, <lb/>
she was assured that her visit had "not only been a <lb/>
time of much enjoyment, but also a starting-point to <lb/>
a higher Christian life." During the January and <lb/>
February of 1861, her own room in Holyoke <reg orig="Semi-|nary">Seminary</reg> <lb/>
became thronged by young ladies anxious for <lb/>
spiritual direction. During those few weeks, fifty <lb/>
or sixty girls gave themselves to the Saviour. In <lb/>
New York and Brooklyn she was invited to meet <lb/>
large gatherings of friends in drawing-rooms, which <lb/>
were occasions long to be remembered as earnest <lb/>
incentives to activities in an unselfish and divine <lb/>
life. In Maine, where she had been invited, she <lb/>
addressed fifteen audiences, although she found it a <lb/>
severe trial to speak in public. These addresses <lb/>
were at first confined to females; but men of all <lb/>
ranks and conditions pleaded so earnestly for the <lb/>
privilege of listening to her words, that they were at <lb/>
last admitted. The immediate result of these various <lb/>
meetings and addresses was a change in the life of <lb/>
many of her hearers. Rich and influential merchants, <lb/>
who had heard words of life as if for the first time, <lb/>
<pb n="98" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0105"/>
learned that there was a more precious treasure than <lb/>
untold gold. Poor mothers and widows found her a <lb/>
true comforter in their day of trial. Little children <lb/>
and rough hard men were equally drawn to her <lb/>
and melted by her words. Wherever she went, <lb/>
she carried with her the aroma of a consecrated <lb/>
life.</p>
<p>Useful as she was, however, she still longed for the <lb/>
country of her adoption. Persia was to her a dear <lb/>
name. Ill and weary as she was, it was with <reg orig="heart-|felt">heartfelt</reg> <lb/>
joy that she made preparation to return to <lb/>
Oroomiah with Dr. Wright in the summer of 1863. <lb/>
The non-completion of the New Testament in Syriac <lb/>
compelled the journey to be postponed until the <lb/>
following spring. This was a great disappointment <lb/>
to Miss Fiske; but, writing to a friend, she said: <lb/>
"Still I am happy in what the Lord directs. If he <lb/>
keeps me here a few months longer, I have only to <lb/>
ask that he will use me in his service." She was <lb/>
pressed to remain and undertake the duties of <reg orig="prin-|cipal">principal</reg> <lb/>
in the Holyoke Seminary; to which she <reg orig="invari-|ably">invariably</reg> <lb/>
replied&mdash;"Persia." She was, however, willing <lb/>
to undertake any duty, to follow any path, which <lb/>
she recognized as the will of her Father. Her clear, <lb/>
dependent faith, she expressed in these words: "He <lb/>
will lead and guide me, for he knows that <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"Oft in my quiet resting-place</l>
<l rend="indent">I hush my hastened breath,</l>
<l>To hear the blessed guiding words</l>
<l rend="indent">His loving Spirit saith,"</l>
</lg></q>
<pb n="99" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0106"/>
Many were the opportunities of usefulness presented <lb/>
to her. One lady was wishful that a young ladies' <lb/>
school should be opened in Boston which should be <lb/>
of a literary and religious character. The managers <lb/>
of the Somerville Asylum were anxious to secure her <lb/>
to take charge of the poor insane occupants of that <lb/>
institution, to whom she would have become as <lb/>
endeared as to the loving girls in far-off Persia. <lb/>
But she waited and still hoped to return to the loved <lb/>
field of usefulness&mdash;Oroomiah. In the meantime she <lb/>
was cheerfully willing to be employed at the Holyoke <lb/>
Seminary, which contained three hundred and forty <lb/>
pupils. To influence and spiritually direct them was <lb/>
now her anxious and prayerful business. The year <lb/>
1864, which was to be her last year upon the earth, <lb/>
Miss Fiske was enabled, amid much bodily weakness, <lb/>
to spend in directing souls to Christ. Her <reg orig="sick-|chamber">sick-chamber</reg> <lb/>
was the scene of many joyous spiritual <reg orig="con-|flicts&mdash;where">conflicts&mdash;where</reg> <lb/>
many of the pupils of the seminary <lb/>
relinquished lives of vanity and worldliness and <reg orig="em-|braced">embraced</reg> <lb/>
the offered love of the Saviour. Occasionally <lb/>
strength was given to her which enabled her to take <lb/>
charge of the public classes. The results of these <lb/>
labours were immediately seen in the conversion of <lb/>
many of the girls. On the 30th of January she <lb/>
wrote: "No less than thirty have made their peace <lb/>
with God during the last week." Shortly afterwards <lb/>
she wrote: "Seventy of the seekers had found peace <lb/>
with God." The meetings of these dear rejoicing <lb/>
<pb n="100" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0107"/>
girls for praise and prayer will never pass from the <lb/>
memory of those who were privileged to take part in <lb/>
them. The days seemed too short and the <reg orig="oppor-|tunities">opportunities</reg> <lb/>
too few to join in that communion of <reg orig="sweet-|est">sweetest</reg> <lb/>
fellowship which is hallowed by the presence of <lb/>
the heavenly Father.</p>
<p>The labours at the seminary had, however, to be <lb/>
given up. Her bodily weakness increased, so that <lb/>
for rest and quiet she returned to her Shelburne <lb/>
home. Her box had been packed in the hope that <lb/>
she could take the journey and stay for a little while <lb/>
on the sea-shore. But there only remained one <lb/>
journey for the dear and loved sufferer&mdash;the journey <lb/>
to her everlasting home! For six long weeks she <lb/>
was confined to bed; during which time her friend <lb/>
Dr. Wright left America for Persia, and to whom <lb/>
she wrote from her sick-bed: "You know that you <lb/>
bear to those dear friends in Oroomiah the love and <lb/>
deepest interest of my heart. They will ask, as they <lb/>
have often done, 'Why does she delay her coming?' <lb/>
and they will henceforth ask this very gently, if my <lb/>
letters have helped them to understand how I long <lb/>
to be with them. If a sea voyage would take me <lb/>
there, I should not be slow in deciding to go to them. <lb/>
If I could not work I could look upon those dear <lb/>
children again, and ask them to hold in remembrance <lb/>
the one way to our 'home,' when I shall have gone <lb/>
from them. Those dear native friends, how my <lb/>
heart goes out toward them! May you be spared <lb/>
<pb n="101" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0108"/>
to meet them, and bless them in the name of the <lb/>
Lord."</p>
<p>She was now fast hastening to that "home" for <lb/>
which her life had been a sanctified preparation. <lb/>
Her last days, owing to the severity of her disease, <lb/>
were marked by much suffering. At times her tears, <lb/>
caused by intense pain, would freely flow; then she <lb/>
would weep at her impatience. At these times, when <lb/>
a divine promise was read to her, she would say&mdash; <lb/>
"Say it over and over again." But her sufferings <lb/>
were to be ended on the 26th of July, when the Rev. <lb/>
E. Y. Swift called to see her. As he entered she <lb/>
held out her hand and said feebly, "Will you pray?" <lb/>
These were her last words. As the prayer ascended <lb/>
to the throne, her liberated spirit joined the ransomed <lb/>
throng&mdash;her sufferings were ended, she had gone to <lb/>
enjoy with the Saviour she had loved upon the earth <lb/>
an eternity of peace! Like him, she had spent her <lb/>
life upon the earth doing good. Without a thought <lb/>
of herself&mdash;her own ease or happiness&mdash;she had <lb/>
offered her Saviour a life of earnest toil in the path <lb/>
of duty. No difficulties or discouragements turned <lb/>
her from the object she had set before her. Solely <lb/>
depending upon the promises of her heavenly Father, <lb/>
to whom her prayers went up unceasingly, she was <lb/>
enabled to bring many from darkness to marvellous <lb/>
light, who will shine as the stars throughout an <reg orig="end-|less">endless</reg> <lb/>
eternity. Truly did she realize the power of <lb/>
prayer, and the earnest, useful life which prayer <lb/>
<pb n="102" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0109"/>
stimulates. Well might she conclude her pilgrimage <lb/>
with the request for prayer; she had a life-knowledge <lb/>
that <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"Prayer ardent opens heaven, lets down a stream</l>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">In</hi> 1871 Miss de Broen visited the famous <lb/>
cemetery of P&egrave;re la Chaise. It was just <lb/>
after the siege of Paris. On the night <lb/>
previous to the visit more than five <reg orig="hun-|dred">hundred</reg> <lb/>
Communists had been shot within the grounds, <lb/>
and buried together in a long ditch. A crowd of <lb/>
wretched relatives surrounded the common grave. <lb/>
Some brought crosses, others wreaths of immortelles, <lb/>
in loving remembrance of husbands, brothers, and <lb/>
sons. Signs of deep grief and settled sadness were <lb/>
seen on the faces of many; others gave vent to cries <lb/>
of rage and revenge. "I have lost all!" cried one <lb/>
poor woman. "Not the love of God," replied Miss <lb/>
de Broen. Consolatory words were uttered, to the <lb/>
astonishment of the poor people, who were not in the <lb/>
<pb n="104" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0111"/>
expectancy of sympathy or kindness. "Christ is the <lb/>
only comforter," said Miss de Broen; and the joy <lb/>
which these words imparted caused her to believe <lb/>
that her heavenly Father had given her work to do <lb/>
in the haunts and the most dreaded places of the <lb/>
lowest quarter of Paris. Her resolution was <reg orig="imme-|diately">immediately</reg> <lb/>
taken, and at once declared on her return to <lb/>
the hotel. She would not be dissuaded on account <lb/>
of personal danger, nor yet by the fact that she had <lb/>
no money to carry out a contemplated mission <reg orig="pro-|ject">project</reg>. <lb/>
She then exclaimed, "If God has put the <lb/>
thought into my heart, he will send the money." <lb/>
And it was sent. Two gentlemen had gone to Paris <lb/>
with money remaining over from funds provided by <lb/>
the Society of Friends for the victims of the war. <lb/>
They heard of Miss de Broen's desire, which was in <lb/>
agreement with their wishes, and the remaining <lb/>
funds were handed over to her. Thus was the way <lb/>
opened for the commencement of her desired work.</p>
<p>Belleville was the head-quarters of the Commune, <lb/>
where terrible deeds had been done. Those who <lb/>
survived the siege were shot, transported, or had to <lb/>
flee from the country. At one time the streets ran <lb/>
with blood. A portion of the pavement was taken <lb/>
up and a pit made to receive the dead strewing the <lb/>
street. Those who were left&mdash;the wives, daughters, <lb/>
and sons&mdash;were shunned as the pestilence. None <lb/>
would give them work or bread. Starvation seemed <lb/>
the only fate reserved for them. In this moment of <lb/>
<pb n="105" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0112"/>
despair Miss de Broen met the poor people in the <lb/>
streets, and entered their houses with an invitation <lb/>
to a room in La Villette, where they would receive <lb/>
fivepence for three hours of work. This invitation <lb/>
was at the first incredulously received, as only three <lb/>
came to the meeting. At the second meeting, eight <lb/>
came, and then the numbers increased. The poor <lb/>
women who presented themselves at the <reg orig="meeting-|room">meeting-room</reg> <lb/>
were for the most part not only starving but <lb/>
fearfully ignorant. When the question was one day <lb/>
put to the women, "Who wrote the Bible?" one of <lb/>
them, as if struck with a bright thought, answered, <lb/>
"You, ma'am." They were not only ignorant, but <lb/>
revengeful; they treasured in their hearts many bad <lb/>
passions caused by long suffering and deprivation. <lb/>
They, with their little ones, had pined in cold and <lb/>
hunger; they had seen their relatives die shocking <lb/>
deaths. Revengefully they concealed weapons under <lb/>
their clothing, in order to suddenly surprise the <lb/>
soldiers. Some of them were so diabolical as to pour <lb/>
petroleum down the grids of private houses. Only a <lb/>
few months passed before a wonderful change was <lb/>
effected. The women who met in the sewing-class <lb/>
were no longer sullen or morose. They had become <lb/>
changed by loving words and kindly deeds. The <lb/>
husbands at home, learning of the message of the <lb/>
gospel, the news of which was brought from the <lb/>
sewing-school by their wives, desired to share in the <lb/>
pleasure of hearing addresses from Miss de Broen. <lb/>
<pb n="106" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0113"/>
An evening meeting was arranged for males, which <lb/>
was conducted by several Christian gentlemen who <lb/>
were taught to have no fears of the Communists. <lb/>
When the room was opened, about two hundred and <lb/>
fifty anxious inquirers crowded into it. One of the <lb/>
gentlemen said at the close of the meeting: "I never <lb/>
witnessed a more interesting sight than that meeting, <lb/>
for the people came solely for the sake of hearing <lb/>
the gospel."</p>
<p>The sorrow and suffering witnessed by Miss de <lb/>
Broen during the first year of her mission work was <lb/>
truly heart-rending. Frequently she would see aged <lb/>
people lying on the floor, the bedstead and other <lb/>
furniture having been broken up for firewood during <lb/>
the siege. One poor woman had presented to her a <lb/>
red flannel petticoat, who said, on being asked why <lb/>
she did not wear it, "Ah, mademoiselle, if you could <lb/>
only give me one of another colour; you know it is <lb/>
red. I have seen so much human blood in the streets, <lb/>
I cannot bear the sight of red." Another said: <lb/>
"During four days I had no food at all, and then I <lb/>
began to burn some of my furniture; and even then I <lb/>
was not warm, for, you see, it was only a piece of the <lb/>
table or the leg of a chair." When Miss de Broen <lb/>
prayed with her, she said "it was like holding a <reg orig="con-|versation">conversation</reg> <lb/>
with God."</p>
<p>The gracious openings for the word of truth were <lb/>
so many, and the people were so anxious and <reg orig="thank-|ful">thankful</reg>, <lb/>
that Miss de Broen found it impossible to meet <lb/>
<pb n="107" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0114"/>
all her self-imposed engagements. Her labour among <lb/>
so many seemed only like a drop in the ocean. <reg orig="Ear-|nestly">Earnestly</reg> <lb/>
did she pray for aid and assistance in the work <lb/>
to which she believed God had called her. One <lb/>
evening, while attending a service conducted by the <lb/>
Rev. Baron Hart in the Rue Royale, a letter was read <lb/>
from an English Independent minister, who desired, <lb/>
if the opportunity were presented, to preach the <lb/>
gospel to the Paris workmen. Miss de Broen <reg orig="con-|sidered">considered</reg> <lb/>
the letter an answer to her prayer for <lb/>
"more labourers;" and to it she replied, "Only come, <lb/>
and the Lord will bless you." When Mr. and Mrs. <lb/>
M'All arrived they found the workmen, members of <lb/>
the despised Commune, willing to hear the glad news <lb/>
of the gospel, and not less willing to receive it in <lb/>
their hearts.</p>
<p>Many of the poor men who had been put in prison <lb/>
on suspicion, were set at liberty after a few weeks. <lb/>
During their detention they had found the <reg orig="incon-|venience">inconvenience</reg> <lb/>
of being compelled to employ the jailer both <lb/>
to read and write their letters. On their release, <lb/>
Miss de Broen promised to teach them to read and <lb/>
write in the evenings, and added to her other labours <lb/>
by opening a night-school. "It was a most <reg orig="interest-|ing">interesting</reg> <lb/>
sight," she said, "to see fathers and sons sitting <lb/>
side by side spelling out words and learning to write." <lb/>
One poor woman, who was over sixty years of age, <lb/>
was so patient and persevering that in a few weeks <lb/>
after commencing to learn to write she presented <lb/>
<pb n="108" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0115"/>
Miss de Broen with a number of scrap sheets and <lb/>
bits of paper covered with verses from the Bible, <lb/>
cooking recipes, and other matters. On surprise <lb/>
being expressed that she had done so much in so <lb/>
little time, she said: "Ah! since I have heard about <lb/>
the good things from you, I no longer go to any <lb/>
neighbours to gossip, neither do I wish that they <lb/>
should come to me, so I lock my door when my <lb/>
work is done: thus I have learned to read and <lb/>
write."</p>
<p>Many delightful instances are recorded of the <lb/>
blessings which followed Miss de Broen's labours. <lb/>
Poor prisoners, on being released, told her of the <lb/>
happiness which the tracts she had sent into the <lb/>
prison had afforded. A meeting specially intended <lb/>
for soldiers was very successful, and resulted in <lb/>
many anxious inquirers and requests for copies of <lb/>
the Scriptures. But now, in the midst of the good <lb/>
work, the money which had been furnished for the <lb/>
work by the Society of Friends was exhausted, and <lb/>
as the Society had undertaken to support a mission <lb/>
at Boulogne-sur-Seine, no further help could be given <lb/>
to Paris. This was a great trial and source of <lb/>
anxiety to Miss de Broen; but, notwithstanding, she <lb/>
had no thought of relinquishing her labours. She <lb/>
believed that they had been designed by her heavenly <lb/>
Father, and that he would find the means for <reg orig="carry-|ing">carrying</reg> <lb/>
on the work. Very soon an answer came to her <lb/>
prayers. One of her friends in England wrote that a <lb/>
<pb n="109" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0116"/>
letter had been received from an American gentleman <lb/>
who had visited the Belleville Mission, and who <lb/>
wrote that he had an impression that more money <lb/>
was needed to carry on the work, and that he was <lb/>
willing to help. Miss de Broen had many other <lb/>
opportunities of observing her Father's care. One <lb/>
day she saw a child crying piteously in the street. <lb/>
On inquiring if it was cold, it answered "No;" if <lb/>
hungry&mdash;"Yes." As she was looking about for a <lb/>
baker's shop, a man passed carrying a loaf. He <lb/>
looked distressed when asked to give her part of it. <lb/>
Quickly surmising his thoughts, she added,&mdash;"I will <lb/>
pay you for it," and put double the value of the loaf <lb/>
into his hands. "Ah, madam," he said, "you don't <lb/>
know what you are doing. I have seven children at <lb/>
home and a sick wife&mdash;but she is a godly woman. <lb/>
The little ones were crying for bread, and I could <lb/>
stand it no longer, so I determined to get it somehow. <lb/>
My wife begged me not to steal it. I got work <lb/>
enough to buy one loaf; and now you have given me <lb/>
money for two."</p>
<p>Owing to the rapidly increasing interest in and <lb/>
success of the mission, Miss de Broen was compelled <lb/>
to reside in Belleville. A house was taken large <lb/>
enough to accommodate a number of ladies who were <lb/>
invited from England to assist her. Very soon a <lb/>
little band of energetic workers joined her in her <lb/>
labours of love; and in order that regular addresses <lb/>
should be given to the workmen, an evangelist was <lb/>
<pb n="110" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0117"/>
engaged to labour and preach to the people who had <lb/>
had much experience, and who loved the work in <lb/>
which he was engaged. Many joyous incidents <lb/>
occurred during the labours of this faithful man. He <lb/>
was much loved by those to whom he ministered, <lb/>
and much honoured by God.</p>
<p>During the first year of the mission the people <lb/>
were subjected to much privation, which was neither <lb/>
owing to indisposition to work nor to <reg orig="intemper-|ance">intemperance</reg>. <lb/>
Many of the people were literally starving, <lb/>
and many contemplated self-destruction as the only <lb/>
means to get quit of the gnawings of hunger. What <lb/>
depths of desperation must be experienced in Paris <lb/>
when the average of suicides in the year is five <lb/>
thousand! It was to relieve this terrible distress <lb/>
that Miss de Broen opened her sewing-class; but the <lb/>
numbers increased so rapidly that she very soon had <lb/>
to refuse many starving applicants. The classes were <lb/>
held on Tuesdays and Fridays, and for three hours' <lb/>
work the poor women received fivepence. Strange <lb/>
as it may appear, many poor widows managed to <lb/>
live on the small sums thus received! One of them <lb/>
actually lived in a room without a single article of <lb/>
furniture, save a sack to lie on, which had been <lb/>
borrowed from a neighbour! The fivepence was <lb/>
given in tickets for meat and bread; the bread being <lb/>
preferred, as the meat requires fire to cook it&mdash;a <lb/>
luxury which it is needless to say the wretched <lb/>
people could seldom afford.</p>
<pb n="111" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0118"/>
<p>But money or meat rewards were not the sole <lb/>
attraction to Miss de Broen's meetings. The despised <lb/>
and shunned Communists had learned something of <lb/>
the joys accompanying the reception of the gospel. <lb/>
Many could and did cry,&mdash;"I am changed; all is <lb/>
changed; my life is changed." One woman said: "I <lb/>
never go to bed without reading God's Word, and I <lb/>
always put it under my pillow; I like to have it <lb/>
close, it gives me such peace and comfort." Another <lb/>
woman, to manifest her love for the Saviour, was <lb/>
accustomed to collect the children and take them in <lb/>
bands of eight or ten to the Sunday school, hearing <lb/>
them on the way recite verses they had committed to <lb/>
memory. This earnest woman, to her great delight, <lb/>
was permitted to take charge of a class in the school. <lb/>
But attendance upon the mission meetings was not <lb/>
always without loss or suffering. Gifts from the <lb/>
sisters of charity must not be expected, and many of <lb/>
their neighbours would despise and shun them; but <lb/>
what matter? as many replied; "I do not mind; the <lb/>
gospel is dearer to me than their gifts." "It is so <lb/>
different to bear hunger with Christ, and to bear <lb/>
hunger without Christ," said one who had often <lb/>
known what it was to be without food.</p>
<p>In 1876 an iron building was sent over from <reg orig="Eng-|land">England</reg> <lb/>
at a cost of &pound;700, and &pound;55 for duty, the charge <lb/>
upon iron entering France. The money was collected <lb/>
from the poor as well as the rich. The building <lb/>
holds four hundred people, and is separated into <lb/>
<pb n="112" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0119"/>
girls' school, infant school, and meeting-room, with <lb/>
doors to throw the whole space into one room when <lb/>
needed. This unpretentious building was of more <lb/>
use in suppressing Communism than any laws or <lb/>
repressive measures. It would have rejoiced the <lb/>
hearts of the English contributors could they have <lb/>
witnessed the devout attention of the earnest <reg orig="wor-|shippers">worshippers</reg> <lb/>
who constantly filled the building. But <lb/>
efforts to spread the gospel were made outside of the <lb/>
workmen's quarters. The <hi rend="italic">conci&egrave;rge</hi>, or porters, to be <lb/>
found close to the door of every house or court in <lb/>
Paris, number more than fifty thousand. As they <lb/>
are always expected to be on duty, they have no <lb/>
opportunity, even if they had the desire, to attend <lb/>
religious meetings. A French lady devoted &pound;1000 <lb/>
to the purchase of fifty thousand copies of the New <lb/>
Testament, one of which was presented to every <lb/>
porter in Paris.</p>
<p>Miss de Broen early found, as all earnest workers <lb/>
find, that the children must have a first place in <lb/>
efforts of moral reform. At a very early date of the <lb/>
mission, the children were gathered together on the <lb/>
Sundays. Subsequently two of the ladies who had <lb/>
devoted themselves to the work of the mission <reg orig="ob-|served">observed</reg> <lb/>
a number of children playing on a waste piece <lb/>
of ground in Belleville. Gathering the little waifs <lb/>
together, an open-air Sunday school was held, which <lb/>
was continued as long as the fine weather continued, <lb/>
when the school was adjourned to the Iron Church. <lb/>
<pb n="113" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0120"/>
The children usually attending numbered more than <lb/>
one hundred and fifty. Each child received a <reg orig="text-|card">text-card</reg>, <lb/>
four of which entitled the holder to a <reg orig="picture-|tract">picture-tract</reg>. <lb/>
The women in the adjoining Bible class took <lb/>
part in the closing school services, prior to which <lb/>
they were called upon to recite the verses they had <lb/>
been learning. Several of the teachers, male and <lb/>
female, were working people: they had tasted of the <lb/>
blessings of the gospel, and found it a joy as well as <lb/>
a duty to carry the good news to others. Many rich <lb/>
rewards were obtained by these devoted labourers. <lb/>
One boy who attended the Sunday school, and who <lb/>
had been subjected to much persecution in <reg orig="conse-|quence">consequence</reg>, <lb/>
was taunted with his mother's poverty, to <lb/>
which he replied, "My mother is poor in the things <lb/>
of this world, but rich in the grace of God." Her <lb/>
poverty is evidenced by the fact that on one <reg orig="occa-|sion">occasion</reg> <lb/>
she had to go without food for three days in <lb/>
order to pay her rent. Her sole comfort was the <lb/>
Word of God. "When I am weak and weary," she <lb/>
said, "then I take my Bible and read a little, and <lb/>
that comforts me."</p>
<p>In 1876 a school was opened for girls in the Iron <lb/>
Church, about one hundred children attending; and <lb/>
although the parents of the children were Roman <lb/>
Catholics, they expressed a desire that their girls <lb/>
should receive Protestant instruction. Many were <lb/>
so ignorant that they scarcely knew the name of God. <lb/>
At the outset the teacher was much discouraged at <lb/>
<pb n="114" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0121"/>
the little progress made in the school. One day, <lb/>
however, on visiting a little girl detained at home <lb/>
through illness, she was rejoiced to hear the mother <lb/>
say, "She is always repeating the verses and hymns <lb/>
she learns at school; she is so good and so easy to <lb/>
nurse." And yet this little girl, when at school, was <lb/>
very dull and seemingly uninterested.</p>
<p>In order that the girls, as they grew up, should <lb/>
have the means of obtaining a livelihood, Miss de <lb/>
Broen devised means to give them a domestic <reg orig="train-|ing">training</reg>, <lb/>
in order that they might be fitted for servants, <lb/>
and so kept away from the bad influence of the <lb/>
workshops, where French girls are subjected to so <lb/>
many temptations. A commencement was made <lb/>
with twelve girls, who went for a part of the day to <lb/>
the sewing-mistress to learn plain sewing and <reg orig="dress-|making">dressmaking</reg>. <lb/>
They also received instruction in the Bible, <lb/>
reading, writing, and arithmetic. In the mornings <lb/>
they received directions and were shown how to do <lb/>
household work by Miss de Broen's servants. One <lb/>
of these girls, "little Berthe," although very young, <lb/>
had had a sad, sorrowful life. Her first employment, <lb/>
when able to walk, had been to lead a blind beggar <lb/>
about the streets. When her mother was visited in <lb/>
her wretched home she was found to be in the last <lb/>
stage of consumption. She had neither fire nor candle, <lb/>
and when she could bear the cold no longer she <lb/>
crawled across the street to receive a little warmth <lb/>
from a neighbour's fire. Death would have been <reg orig="re-|ceived">received</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="115" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0122"/>
as a blessing, if she could have been assured <lb/>
that her little girl would be cared for. Her last <lb/>
days were lightened by kindly ministrations. When <lb/>
the end came, she departed in the possession of a <lb/>
blessed hope that she was going to her heavenly <lb/>
Father, in whom she had believed, and that all would <lb/>
be well with her little girl.</p>
<p>Distressing cases like that of "little Berthe" <reg orig="in-|duced">induced</reg> <lb/>
Miss de Broen to remember the bodies as well <lb/>
as the souls of the poor children running about the <lb/>
streets. Arrangements were made to give a dinner <lb/>
twice a week to about forty children. At first the <lb/>
children, who had been scarcely fed at all, were <lb/>
unable to consume all the soup and bread given to <lb/>
them. Very soon, however, their natural appetites <lb/>
returned, and they were able to eat heartily the food <lb/>
so generously provided.</p>
<p>Another means of blessing the poor&mdash;who, for the <lb/>
most part, owing to the many deprivations to which <lb/>
they were subjected, were seldom without serious <lb/>
complaints and illnesses&mdash;was the establishment of a <lb/>
medical mission to which all might resort for advice <lb/>
and medicine. At 12 Rue Piat, every day, except <lb/>
Wednesday and Saturday, at ten o'clock in the <reg orig="morn-|ing">morning</reg>, <lb/>
a number of men, women, and children, suffering <lb/>
from various bodily ills, may be seen listening to an <lb/>
earnest gospel address and joining in simple hymns <lb/>
and prayers. At the end of the singing and prayers, <lb/>
each patient in turn goes into the consulting-room. <lb/>
<pb n="116" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0123"/>
While the rest of the patients are waiting, some of <lb/>
the ladies engage in conversation with them, and <lb/>
make them presents of little tracts. One of the <lb/>
patients, who was at the mission for the first time, <lb/>
had the parable of the Prodigal Son read to her. On <lb/>
hearing the words, "I will arise, and go to my father," <lb/>
she put her hand on the lady's arm, and looking <lb/>
anxiously into her face, she said, "But perhaps the <lb/>
father will not receive him." "Wait, and we will <lb/>
see," was the answer. The poor woman burst into <lb/>
tears when she heard the joyous ending of the <lb/>
parable. About three hundred and fifty patients <reg orig="re-|ceive">receive</reg> <lb/>
gratuitous medicine and advice each week.</p>
<p>The medical mission was founded in 1873, and at <lb/>
the first was largely supported by the Edinburgh <lb/>
Medical Missionary Society, which guaranteed the <lb/>
salary of the medical missionary for two years. <lb/>
When the two years expired, the salary of the <reg orig="mis-|sionary">missionary</reg> <lb/>
and the cost of the medicines fell upon Miss <lb/>
de Broen. The success, however, which had attended <lb/>
the work,&mdash;success in saving the bodies and souls of <lb/>
hundreds of wretched sufferers,&mdash;encouraged her not <lb/>
to stay the good work. The many delightful <reg orig="in-|stances">instances</reg> <lb/>
of spiritual good, through the agency of the <lb/>
mission, demonstrated the good providence of God in <lb/>
its creation; and that which he approves and blesses <lb/>
must not be stayed for want of means to carry it on. <lb/>
Many who went to the mission with disordered <lb/>
bodies learned of the far greater disorder of their <lb/>
<pb n="117" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0124"/>
souls; and while disease was yielding to kindly <lb/>
medical treatment, they were learning of the great <lb/>
Physician&mdash;the healer of their spiritual ills.</p>
<p>Many cheering instances of moral and spiritual <lb/>
good are recorded. A visitor to a wretched home <lb/>
found a poor man that attended the medical mission <lb/>
who was in a deep decline. He believed that the <lb/>
medicines had done him good, but the good words he <lb/>
had heard in the Iron Church had led to peace in his <lb/>
soul. His wife had gone one Sabbath afternoon to <lb/>
the service. On her return, rejoicing in what she <lb/>
had heard, her husband was persuaded to go in the <lb/>
evening, and ever since he had "believed in Jesus."</p>
<p>One poor woman, once sunk in ignorance and <reg orig="dark-|ness">darkness</reg>, <lb/>
who had lost her parents at a very early age, <lb/>
and who had had none to care for her or instruct <lb/>
her, an impulsive and violent temper leading her <lb/>
into much sin, said, "Before I became converted, <lb/>
I used to rush all over the town for work. If I <lb/>
found it, it was well; but if not, then I blasphemed! <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Now</hi>, whatever happens, I ask God to keep me calm; <lb/>
and when I look to him, it is restfulness and peace. <lb/>
He gives me grace to resist when the evil is very <lb/>
strong." It was noticed on one occasion that she <lb/>
was not in her place, and was in consequence visited <lb/>
in the morning. On opening the door, she said, "God <lb/>
has sent you! for we all went to bed without food <lb/>
last night. I could not come to the meeting because I <lb/>
was naughty, very naughty. We had had no food all <lb/>
<pb n="118" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0125"/>
day, and in the evening I took my husband's best <lb/>
coat to the pledge-office; but as I could only obtain <lb/>
three francs for it, I would not leave it. I came <lb/>
home and told my husband. He was quite calm; but <lb/>
I was very rebellious, and could not pray, and that <lb/>
was why I did not go to the Bible class." Her poor <lb/>
husband, who was fast hastening to the grave, was <lb/>
remonstrated with on attending an evening meeting <lb/>
in his delicate state of health. "Oh," he replied, "it <lb/>
is like a ray of sunshine to me to come here; and as <lb/>
there is no more hope of my recovery, let me come. <lb/>
I do not fret over my perishing body now, for I have <lb/>
all things in Christ, and I shall soon be with him for <lb/>
ever."</p>
<p>A bright little woman was one day conversed with <lb/>
in the dispensary. She had received no good from <lb/>
the preaching in the Catholic chapel, and could not <lb/>
understand how confession to the priest could take <lb/>
away her sins. Her perplexity and trouble often <lb/>
prevented her from sleeping. Her husband, although <lb/>
a sceptic, told her she had better go to the mission <lb/>
services, as the priests turn and twist the Scriptures. <lb/>
The address on the evening she attended the Iron <lb/>
Church was founded upon, "The blood of Jesus Christ <lb/>
cleanseth us from all sin." She then saw, as she <lb/>
said, "how it is that all sin can be taken away."</p>
<p>Another of the medical mission patients was a <lb/>
poor man who had had a varied and singular life. <lb/>
A Belgian by birth, when only a youth he joined the <lb/>
<pb n="119" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0126"/>
order of the <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italic">Monks de la Trappe</hi></foreign>, the rules of the <lb/>
order enforcing absolute silence, the members never <lb/>
being allowed to speak except to the superiors. The <lb/>
poor lad, being in the choir, knew the Psalms in <lb/>
Latin by heart, but his knowledge, like a parrot's, <lb/>
was without understanding. After spending five <lb/>
years in the monastery, a scandal having arisen, he <lb/>
and the other novices were sent away. He then <lb/>
went to a monastery in Spain, but being disappointed <lb/>
with the characters and lives of the monks, he left <lb/>
with much disbelief and doubt in his heart. After <lb/>
a long illness, being unable to continue paying the <lb/>
doctor, he went to the free medical mission. While <lb/>
waiting to be called into the consulting-room, one of <lb/>
the ladies entered into conversation with him. At <lb/>
the outset he refused to listen to any reference to <lb/>
God, in whom, as he said, "he did not believe." <lb/>
Presently, however, he listened attentively. He was <lb/>
afterwards visited at his home, and offered a New <lb/>
Testament. He would rather have a Bible, he said, <lb/>
because he was anxious to know what the Psalms <lb/>
were like in French. He confessed that he only <lb/>
understood a word or two when he read and chanted <lb/>
them in Latin. When the visitor spoke of peace <lb/>
being procurable through the blood of Christ, he <lb/>
cried eagerly, "Oh, if only I had it!" Very soon he <lb/>
found that which he so much desired&mdash;"the peace of <lb/>
God, which passeth all understanding."</p>
<p>Another poor patient, who was paralyzed, and who <lb/>
<pb n="120" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0127"/>
had been a prisoner in his room for ten years, was <lb/>
offered by a lady a drive through the city. Thanking <lb/>
her for the considerate kindness, he desired first to <lb/>
go to the mission dispensary,&mdash;he wanted to tell the <lb/>
patients what God had done for his soul. He was a <lb/>
great sufferer, every part of his body, except his head, <lb/>
having lost all sense of touch. His sufferings at times <lb/>
were so intense that his cries resounded through the <lb/>
house. His dreadful condition was caused by exposure <lb/>
to cold during the Crimean war. One night he and <lb/>
two other soldiers lay down to sleep in the trenches. <lb/>
When he awoke he found his companions frozen to <lb/>
death by his side! In his present pitiable condition <lb/>
he could do nothing towards his own support. His <lb/>
wife was enabled to find bare food, but no more, by <lb/>
polishing spectacle frames; but a low fever which <lb/>
seized her cut off this resource and reduced them to <lb/>
pitiable poverty. Often had the poor man <reg orig="contem-|plated">contemplated</reg> <lb/>
committing suicide, but the knowledge of the <lb/>
existence of a Supreme Being had kept him from the <lb/>
act of self-destruction. A friend had presented him <lb/>
with a large Bible, which he read with great attention; <lb/>
and although unable to quit his chair he had tried to <lb/>
be useful by speaking encouraging words to a poor <reg orig="suf-|ferer">sufferer</reg> <lb/>
who was threatened with an attack of his own <lb/>
complaint. He could simply but earnestly point out the <lb/>
way to obtain salvation, which the listener soon found; <lb/>
then, in the midst of their sufferings, the two friends <lb/>
could mutually rejoice in the love of their Saviour.</p>
<pb n="121" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0128"/>
<p>The medical mission opened up opportunities which <lb/>
probably would not have been found had it not been <lb/>
for that useful institution. The site of the <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italic">Buttes <lb/>
Chaumont Park</hi></foreign> had, previous to its formation, been <lb/>
occupied by a number of the most wretched huts, <lb/>
inhabited by a number of the worst characters in <lb/>
Paris. When the park was formed in 1866, the <lb/>
dwellers in the huts went to reside in the <reg orig="neighbour-|ing">neighbouring</reg> <lb/>
streets. These dregs of society, more subject to <lb/>
disease than their neighbours living cleanly and <lb/>
decently, were often found at the mission dispensary, <lb/>
and thus became known to the visiting ladies. Two <lb/>
or three of them at length resolved to make an effort <lb/>
to carry the gospel message to the dreaded quarter. <lb/>
On the Sunday following the resolve, a service was <lb/>
held in one of the courts. After hymns had been <lb/>
sung and a chapter read, an address was given from <lb/>
the words, "He saved others, himself he cannot save." <lb/>
Windows were thrown up, staircases were filled by <lb/>
the inhabitants, and much interest generally was <lb/>
manifested in the service.</p>
<p>As the people in the neighbourhood were very <lb/>
poor&mdash;really in want&mdash;Miss de Broen started a <reg orig="soup-|kitchen">soup-kitchen</reg>, <lb/>
the owner of a wine-shop offering his room <lb/>
for the purpose of distributing the soup. The soup <lb/>
was sold twice a week&mdash;Wednesday and Saturday&mdash; <lb/>
at one penny per quart. Before, however, the soup <lb/>
was distributed, hymns were sung and chapters in <lb/>
the Bible read. The little meeting first begun in the <lb/>
<pb n="122" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0129"/>
court had soon a large increase of attentive <reg orig="wor-|shippers">worshippers</reg>, <lb/>
the meetings being held on the Sunday <lb/>
afternoons. When the meeting was over, a ragged <lb/>
school was immediately commenced in the wine-shop. <lb/>
The children who attended are described as most <lb/>
attentive and interested. One of the teachers&mdash;a <lb/>
poor cobbler&mdash;had much enjoyment in instructing <lb/>
the children committed to his charge. When visited <lb/>
in his home, which consisted of one small back room, <lb/>
he was found seated on a stool cobbling, with a <reg orig="num-|ber">number</reg> <lb/>
of children round him. He was teaching them <lb/>
the story of the child Jesus being left behind at <lb/>
Jerusalem. One of the children, out of pity he had <lb/>
taken from the streets, and hoped not only to find <lb/>
him a home, but to teach him his business. This <lb/>
worthy man, who had been often straitened in his <lb/>
means, had heard the gospel message in the Iron <lb/>
Church, and had believed and received the gift of <lb/>
peace promised to believers. The fact that this man <lb/>
was a true believer was evidenced by his confession: <lb/>
"Even if I am hungry I do not mind it so much; for <lb/>
now that I have the peace of God in my soul I seem <lb/>
to be able to do without things so much better."</p>
<p>All this work&mdash;this truly good and great work <lb/>
&mdash;was initiated by Miss de Broen, by her resolve, <lb/>
in God's strength, to do what she could to help the <lb/>
poor Communists of Paris. The effort, because made <lb/>
in faith, because carried out patiently and <reg orig="persever-|ingly">perseveringly</reg>, <lb/>
has resulted in untold blessings. The great <lb/>
<pb n="123" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0130"/>
day alone will reveal the number of hearts changed <lb/>
and lives amended&mdash;changed and amended through <lb/>
the blessed instrumentality of Miss de Broen, <hi rend="italic">who <lb/>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">We</hi> are under obligations to Lady Mary <lb/>
Wortley Montagu for a knowledge of the <lb/>
lives lived in Eastern harems, which, <lb/>
instead of being a condition of calm, <lb/>
peace, and contentment, is a horrid state in which <lb/>
<pb n="125" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0132"/>
the heart and soul of woman is buried. Harem life <lb/>
is literally death in life&mdash;a life in which every particle <lb/>
of existence, the existence which is the birthright of <lb/>
every human being, is utterly and completely <reg orig="de-|stroyed">destroyed</reg>. <lb/>
But harem life in Egypt is the exception, <lb/>
not the rule. There is a <hi rend="italic">low-down life</hi> in the land of <lb/>
the Pharaohs which has nothing to do with the gilded <lb/>
toys of the secluded harem&mdash;a life which is led and <lb/>
endured for the most part in the open air, on the <lb/>
house-tops, and in the streets of the only seaport of <lb/>
Northern Egypt, Alexandria; where life is made up <lb/>
of troops of ragged, shouting donkey-boys; women <lb/>
in scanty robes of cotton, with their faces tied in <lb/>
veils; little brown babies, with dirty kerchiefs on <lb/>
their heads, clinging to the shoulders of their mothers; <lb/>
men from the Levant, in half-European and <reg orig="half-|Oriental">half-Oriental</reg> <lb/>
costume, loitering about; ladies in silken, <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">shroud-like</hi> dresses; negroes and Nubians, Jews and <lb/>
Algerines, Greeks, Turks, and Maltese, forming a <lb/>
scene which is not easily imagined. It is difficult <lb/>
for the stranger in the streets of that famed city to <lb/>
realize that he is in the land of the pyramids, the <lb/>
land full of the traditions of Abraham, Isaac, and <lb/>
Jacob, and yet forgetful of the God of the prophets, <lb/>
and of the only refuge for sin and uncleanness <lb/>
which God has provided for his erring children.</p>
<p>Miss M. L. Whately, the daughter of the late <reg orig="Arch-|bishop">Archbishop</reg> <lb/>
of Dublin, to whom we are indebted for many <lb/>
a true glimpse of Eastern life, wondered who invented <lb/>
<pb n="126" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0133"/>
the fable of Oriental gravity, or whether some Eastern <lb/>
race really exists which is habitually grave, silent, <lb/>
and solemn. She likened the Egyptians to the Irish <lb/>
in their love of fun, mirthfulness, and excited life; <lb/>
and the public life of the Cairo bazaars to all the <lb/>
noise, hurry, and bustle of an English fair. The <lb/>
street dealers in onions, bread, and sugar-cane, sitting <lb/>
all day long before their stalls, were by no means <lb/>
silent. They would talk with every passer-by; and <lb/>
when evening came, and a few sharp bargainers would <lb/>
try to get oranges and beans at a lower price than <lb/>
the day's tariff, the babel of tongues was amazing; <lb/>
slaps on the shoulder, and cries of "You dog!" <lb/>
"You buffalo!" "You ass!" "You Jew!" rang <lb/>
through the air. But there was withal a large <lb/>
admixture of merriness, so that there was as much <lb/>
laughter as scolding.</p>
<p>It was to Alexandria, Cairo, and to Egypt, that <lb/>
Miss Whately had gone, in the hope of doing <reg orig="some-|thing">something</reg> <lb/>
for her Master among the poor low-down and <lb/>
neglected dwellers in the land of mummies and ruins. <lb/>
That which she could do that she would do, and <lb/>
trust to patience, endurance, and to Heaven's blessing <lb/>
for the desired result. She commenced her work in <lb/>
the Nile boat on observing the childish amusements <lb/>
by which the boatmen were accustomed to while <lb/>
away the time. They were asked if they would like <lb/>
a story read to them. "What, in Arabic? Could <lb/>
the sitt &lsqb;lady&rsqb; read Arabic?" On learning that the <lb/>
<pb n="127" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0134"/>
lady could do so, they said it was <hi rend="italic">good</hi>, and they <lb/>
would listen. They had then read to them the story <lb/>
of the sheep lost in the wilderness, and the piece of <lb/>
silver lost in the house; then followed the story of <lb/>
the prodigal son, which excited frequent <reg orig="exclama-|tions">exclamations</reg> <lb/>
of "Good!" "Praise God!" "That is <reg orig="wonder-|ful">wonderful</reg>!" <lb/>
This ended, thinking that the hearers were <lb/>
tired, the reader closed the book, when there arose <lb/>
the general cry, "Lissa! lissa!" &lpar;"Not yet! not yet!"&rpar; <lb/>
The ten commandments were then read, and a few <lb/>
remarks were made to press the lessons to the hearts <lb/>
of these poor, ignorant believers in the Prophet. One <lb/>
old man, when the others had withdrawn to roll <lb/>
themselves up in corners to sleep, remained sitting in <lb/>
his place; and looking up with a touchingly wistful <lb/>
expression, he said, "What is a poor, ignorant man like <lb/>
me to do? What will be required of me? I cannot <lb/>
read, and you will soon go. I'll hear no more of this. <lb/>
How am I to know what God would have me do?" <lb/>
The poor old man, with his white beard and <reg orig="weather-|beaten">weather-beaten</reg>, <lb/>
time-worn face, was fast hastening to his end. <lb/>
He was told to pray&mdash;to come to the feet of Him <lb/>
who can save to the <hi rend="italic">uttermost.</hi></p>
<p>This evening's effort, this casting of the bread upon <lb/>
the waters, could not be lost. The result might not <lb/>
be fully seen in this world; but eternity might <lb/>
unfold the glorious truth that the seed had fallen <lb/>
into good ground, had taken root, and had brought <lb/>
forth fruit which should ripen for ever. Miss Whately <lb/>
<pb n="128" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0135"/>
had gone to Egypt to establish schools. Her hope <lb/>
for the future lay in the children. But she had been <lb/>
told that "Moslem girls will not come to school; you <lb/>
are sure to fail." Even a native gentleman, who had <lb/>
been educated in England, and who, therefore, would <lb/>
wish well to the effort, said, "They do not wish for <lb/>
education in the lower class, especially for girls, who <lb/>
are, as you know, looked on as inferior beings <reg orig="alto-|gether">altogether</reg> <lb/>
by Moslems. Besides, if you collected a few <lb/>
who would come from curiosity, some bigot would <lb/>
soon frighten away the children, and tell the parents <lb/>
you wanted to make Christians of them." Miss <lb/>
Whately was perplexed, but she would not despair. <lb/>
She could only reply, "Time will show." In this <lb/>
spirit the little schoolroom was made ready: a few <lb/>
prints and texts in Arabic were nailed on the walls; <lb/>
some alphabet cards and a stocked work-basket were <lb/>
all that it further needed. Seats and benches in the <lb/>
East are a superfluity. But the children had to be <lb/>
induced to come. The seedsman opposite, who was <lb/>
eating his breakfast with his three young daughters, <lb/>
was asked in most conciliatory tones to send them to <lb/>
the school. The answer returned in a sullen voice <lb/>
was: "We are Moslems, and don't want to learn." <lb/>
Women were accosted in the streets and informed of <lb/>
the school, and urged to send their children. Some <lb/>
laughed and passed on; others said, "Very good," and <lb/>
promised as desired. The first woman who brought <lb/>
a child was received with the customary salutation, <lb/>
<pb n="129" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0136"/>
"Be welcome!" But in a volley of words, which she <lb/>
rapidly poured out, she said her child was timid, but <lb/>
she should be sent to-morrow. The child was caressed <lb/>
and kindly spoken to. The mother told her <reg orig="neigh-|bours">neighbours</reg> <lb/>
that the lady had kissed her child. Next day <lb/>
the little girl was duly sent as promised. Then came <lb/>
two little girls followed by their mothers, their <reg orig="grand-|mothers">grandmothers</reg>, <lb/>
and several women in rags. When they <lb/>
had gone, several more children arrived, so that <lb/>
presently nine little Moslem girls were seated on the <lb/>
mat. On the question being put, "Who made you?" <lb/>
the elder children replied, "Allah;" the little ones <lb/>
said, "Mohammed." The first verse of the Bible was <lb/>
taught them, and the first five letters of the Arabic <lb/>
alphabet. They were then allowed to rest, and a <lb/>
singing lesson commenced. The first effort Miss <lb/>
Whately likened to the discordant mewing of a set <lb/>
of cats. Three months later, however, and a visitor <lb/>
was delighted by the sweet singing of the children. <lb/>
After the singing lesson came the task of sewing. But <lb/>
this the children enjoyed famously. Indeed, they <lb/>
had several times during the morning thrown down <lb/>
their cards and cried, "The work! give us the work!" <lb/>
During the day the mothers and sisters of the children <lb/>
dropped into the school to see how things were going <lb/>
on, bringing bread, raw carrots, or some such dainty <lb/>
for the little girls.</p>
<p>On the second day fourteen children attended the <lb/>
school. As they entered, they put off their slippers <lb/>
<pb n="130" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0137"/>
at the door, and then went up to kiss the hand of <lb/>
the teacher, and lay it on their heads. One of the <lb/>
scholars named Salhah took offence, and stayed from <lb/>
the school a week owing to another girl tearing the <lb/>
arms off a doll she had managed to manufacture out <lb/>
of a piece of rag. Just after this came the news that <lb/>
Salhah was going to be married. She was only <lb/>
eleven years old. Her mother wanted to get rid of <lb/>
the necessity of keeping her, and the mother of a lad <lb/>
of fifteen wanted a drudge to carry water. Neither <lb/>
the boy nor the girl was consulted. The mothers <lb/>
arranged everything. For the bridal feast some <hi rend="italic">meat</hi> <lb/>
was cooked&mdash;a great variety. The bride elect obtained <lb/>
some sweetmeats as her share, and a present of two <lb/>
piastres &lpar;about fourpence&rpar;, with which she bought <lb/>
more sweetmeats, for which she received a beating <lb/>
from her mother. Fortunately the match was <reg orig="ulti-|mately">ultimately</reg> <lb/>
broken off. Salhah had more spirit than <lb/>
usual, and <hi rend="italic">would</hi> say, "Mush ouz" &lpar;"Not want"&rpar;; <lb/>
which caused her soon to return to the school.</p>
<p>One young matron of fifteen, Shoh, looking in at <lb/>
the school, could not resist joining the girls; and <reg orig="seiz-|ing">seizing</reg> <lb/>
an alphabet card, she commenced "Alef-beh." Her <lb/>
husband, at the first, tried to prevent her attending <lb/>
school, and beat her for doing so. When, however, <lb/>
he was in a good humour, or absent with his donkey, <lb/>
she would run in with a glad look on her bright <lb/>
face and seat herself to a lesson. After a time her <lb/>
husband gave her permission to attend, when she <lb/>
<pb n="131" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0138"/>
would occasionally rush in with her hands all white <lb/>
with flour from bread-making. She was occasionally <lb/>
permitted to pay Miss Whately a private visit at her <lb/>
home; when the very simple furniture, and, as the <lb/>
Americans would say, fixings, excited her unbounded <lb/>
astonishment. A Bible that lay upon the table, in <lb/>
answer to her question, was explained to her; which <lb/>
elicited more questions than her entertainer could <lb/>
answer. Shoh's mother, however, a very ugly old <lb/>
woman, wanted to cause a disturbance by insinuating <lb/>
that Miss Whately wanted to carry the children to <lb/>
England. She was indignantly told that there were <lb/>
plenty of girls in England&mdash;more than were wanted. <lb/>
Shoh laughed at the idea of the children being wanted <lb/>
in England; but the old woman had too long literally <lb/>
and figuratively grovelled in the dust to believe that <lb/>
any one would undertake such a task as keeping <lb/>
school without a mercenary motive. Shoh listened <lb/>
attentively to the explanation that love induced her <lb/>
to teach the children, and then earnestly inquired, <lb/>
"Do you love me?" The girl's eyes glistened on <reg orig="re-|ceiving">receiving</reg> <lb/>
the reply: "Yd habeeby!" &lpar;"Oh, my dear!"&rpar; <lb/>
"certainly I do, and all of you: I want you to go <lb/>
to heaven with me, Shoh."</p>
<p>Shoh's sister, Fatmah, who had just lost all her <lb/>
three children by croup, and who "went mourning" <lb/>
all the day, came on a visit to learn something more <lb/>
than she had heard of the school. She visited Miss <lb/>
Whately's home, and noticed a portrait of a little <lb/>
<pb n="132" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0139"/>
child upon the wall. Her own little ones could hardly <lb/>
have been like that portrait; but still it was a child. <lb/>
The young mother gazed for a moment, saying in a <lb/>
soft voice, "Very pretty! very pretty!" then bent <lb/>
forward and kissed it, and burst into tears, hiding <lb/>
her face in her veil. She had been told that her boys <lb/>
would have thousands of houris to wait on them; <lb/>
but those monstrous stories gave her no comfort. <lb/>
Christian instruction and comfort were given her, <lb/>
and by degrees her extreme sorrow diminished. Her <lb/>
husband, who was very kind to her, left Old Cairo in <lb/>
order that his wife might attend school, and be <reg orig="com-|forted">comforted</reg> <lb/>
by the English lady. Shoh and Fatmah <reg orig="be-|came">became</reg> <lb/>
Miss Whately's hope.</p>
<p>In the winter season Miss Whately was <reg orig="accus-|tomed">accustomed</reg> <lb/>
to go into the desert and spend the day under <lb/>
a small tent. One day she was surrounded by a <lb/>
number of Arabs, who were much amused at the idea <lb/>
of teaching girls. Amid shouts of laughter, they <lb/>
cried, "O teacher! O teacher!" Then, in the true <lb/>
Arabic fashion, they commenced to question her <lb/>
about her relations and friends. She excited their <lb/>
sympathy by telling them of the death of relatives <lb/>
and of the heavenly country to which they had gone.</p>
<p>"You have heard of Moses?" said Miss Whately.</p>
<p>"Oh yes, Nebby Moussa! we know about him."</p>
<p>"God spoke to Moses; you have heard that?"</p>
<p>"Yes, yes; we know."</p>
<p>"Well, God does not speak now to men; but <lb/>
<pb n="133" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0140"/>
listen: if you had a father far away, he could send <lb/>
you a letter, could he not? You might thus know <lb/>
what he wished you to do."</p>
<p>"Yes, lady, certainly," said the men.</p>
<p>"God's book is his letter to man. We read in this <lb/>
book all God wishes us to do and to believe."</p>
<p>"Good! good! a letter; I understand."</p>
<p>Then came the explanation, that holy men, taught <lb/>
by God's Spirit, had written the Bible, and that it <lb/>
was God's letter to sinful man.</p>
<p>"You ought to come here every day," said one of <lb/>
the speakers. "Come, and read and talk to us; come, <lb/>
and stay all day, till the sun sets; and then, when you <lb/>
want to sleep, I will give you a bed in my house."</p>
<p>Here was evidence that the poor neglected Arabs <lb/>
of the desert would welcome the sound of the gospel, <lb/>
and would soon cry in Arabic, "How beautiful on <lb/>
the mountains are the feet of them that publish <lb/>
peace!" But, nevertheless, they always laughed <lb/>
heartily at the idea of teaching girls to read. When <lb/>
they heard of the school for poor Moslem girls <reg orig="com-|menced">commenced</reg> <lb/>
in Cairo, the news was always received with <lb/>
derisive mirth. Miss Whately said that she really <lb/>
believed that the idea of teaching girls to read was <lb/>
quite as amusing and absurd to them as it would be <lb/>
to English villagers if some one gravely proposed to <lb/>
instruct their <hi rend="italic">cats</hi> in the alphabet.</p>
<p>One day Miss Whately wandered to a poor Arab <lb/>
village, in company with an old Syrian colporteur, <lb/>
<pb n="134" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0141"/>
who tried to interest the inhabitants with a few <lb/>
verses from the New Testament. He failed, owing <lb/>
to being too solemn, and from want of tact. "Well," <lb/>
said Miss Whately, "is not that good that he has read <lb/>
to you?"</p>
<p>A lazy-looking young fellow answered, "Yes; <lb/>
but we are Arabs, and do not understand all that."</p>
<p>"You do not think, and that is why you do not <lb/>
understand anything."</p>
<p>"Exactly so; I do not think," said he, with an air <lb/>
of great complacency.</p>
<p>"But you are not a camel, nor an ass; you have a <lb/>
soul within you."</p>
<p>"Oh, certainly! A soul, yes!"</p>
<p>"Well, then, you ought to think."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes! that is true;" nodding his head with <lb/>
somewhat more interest.</p>
<p>He was then told that the need for thinking was <lb/>
because death was near&mdash;perhaps very near. To <lb/>
which he replied, "True, all must die; but God is <lb/>
good."</p>
<p>Upon another occasion Miss Whately bribed the <lb/>
story-teller, always an important personage in the <lb/>
coffee-houses of the East, instead of telling a story, to <lb/>
read from an Arabic Testament. It was rather a <lb/>
venturesome experiment. Miss Whately was posted <lb/>
at an open window, concealed by the darkness, <reg orig="listen-|ing">listening</reg> <lb/>
anxiously for the voice of the reader. The first <lb/>
words caught were from the second chapter of <reg orig="Mat-|thew's">Matthew's</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="135" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0142"/>
Gospel, of the star that "stood over the house <lb/>
where the young child was." The audience was <lb/>
composed of five-and-twenty men, for the most part <lb/>
silent and attentive. "It was an evening," said Miss <lb/>
Whately, "never to be forgotten in the annals of <lb/>
Bab-el-Bahar; for surely never in that quarter had <lb/>
God's word been heard or read before." The <reg orig="Bible-|reading">Bible-reading</reg> <lb/>
continued for several months, until the <reg orig="story-|teller">storyteller</reg> <lb/>
went to Alexandria. "We often wondered," <lb/>
said Miss Whately, "what effect the reading had upon <lb/>
the reader." But this they did not learn.</p>
<p>One advantage of the school was, that the children <lb/>
learned hymns and Scripture texts, which they <reg orig="re-|peated">repeated</reg> <lb/>
again and again in their homes. One mother, <lb/>
on a hymn being mentioned to her, said, "I know all <lb/>
that now; she &lsqb;her daughter&rsqb; is singing it all day." <lb/>
Thus these children became, in a sense, home <reg orig="mission-|aries">missionaries</reg>, <lb/>
and carried seeds of truth to the souls of their <lb/>
parents. Certainly, the parents were sadly ignorant <lb/>
of many things besides the truths which concerned <lb/>
their eternal interest. The ignorance which prevails <lb/>
in Egypt relative to the conditions of health and <reg orig="dis-|ease">disease</reg> <lb/>
is most lamentable, leading in many instances <lb/>
to blindness and confirmed helplessness. Here is an <lb/>
illustration. One of the scholars attending the school <lb/>
was taken ill. The mother was in despair, and <reg orig="ex-|pected">expected</reg> <lb/>
she would die. She would not call in a doctor <lb/>
as advised&mdash;"If it were God's will her child should <lb/>
die, she <hi rend="italic">would</hi> die; and if it were his will she should <lb/>
<pb n="136" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0143"/>
live, she <hi rend="italic">would</hi> live." This was mistaken for faith. <lb/>
When Miss Whately visited the girl, she found an old <lb/>
Coptic priest burning incense in one corner of the <lb/>
room and muttering prayers. The mother and aunt of <lb/>
the girl, the pictures of misery, with tears running <lb/>
down their faces, sat in another part of the room. <lb/>
It was difficult to persuade them to do anything for <lb/>
the little sufferer. All that they would consent to do <lb/>
was that the girl's face and hands should be washed; <lb/>
and that she should take a little medicine, which the <lb/>
aunt would call for in the evening. Some nice soup <lb/>
was prepared; and on the next call, poor Ghemiana <lb/>
was better, and able to answer questions more <reg orig="cheer-|fully">cheerfully</reg>. <lb/>
It was touching to hear her say that during <lb/>
her illness she had very frequently said "Our Father." <lb/>
Miss Whately says: "She was a most patient, <reg orig="good-|tempered">good-tempered</reg> <lb/>
girl, whether sick or well; and when she <lb/>
recovered, which she soon did, her plain face, with its <lb/>
heavy features and sallow tint, looked quite bright <lb/>
and pleasant, lit up with grateful smiles, as she came <lb/>
to return thanks and bring me an offering of Eastern <lb/>
cakes, made by her mother, as a token of her good <lb/>
feelings." The poor girl was not allowed to remain <lb/>
long at school. An offer of marriage was made to <lb/>
her; and her parents, knowing that she was both poor <lb/>
and plain, would not risk the loss of the match, and <lb/>
she became an unwilling bride.</p>
<p>Among "the city Arabs" in Cairo, Miss Whately <lb/>
found much to interest and call forth her sympathies. <lb/>
<pb n="137" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0144"/>
The donkey-boys of Cairo are an institution. <reg orig="Trav-|ellers">Travellers</reg> <lb/>
who have come in contact with them, as they <lb/>
journeyed to India, speak of them as "unmitigated <lb/>
rascals," "the pests of Cairo," "smart, clever lads," or <lb/>
"bright little fellows," according to the treatment <lb/>
they have received from them. One of these boys <lb/>
when corrected for swearing, replied, grinning as he <lb/>
said it, <hi rend="italic">"That Engeliz!"</hi> He seemed surprised when <lb/>
told that no Englishman who feared God used such <lb/>
language. He certainly did not think there were <lb/>
any Englishmen who cared for the name of God. <lb/>
These boys, it is true, have the opportunity of <reg orig="attend-|ing">attending</reg> <lb/>
school, where the Koran is the only book used, <lb/>
and where it and the formal Mohammedan prayers <lb/>
are printed on their memories with a heavy stick; <lb/>
but owing to the fight which the boys have for <reg orig="exist-|ence&mdash;begging">existence&mdash;begging</reg> <lb/>
and scrambling for a morsel of food&mdash; <lb/>
they cannot avail themselves of any advantages which <lb/>
the schools may offer. One of these boys, known as <lb/>
little Abdul Leyl, about nine or ten years of age, who <lb/>
was accustomed to accompany Miss Whately on her <lb/>
donkey rides, hearing of the girls' school, brought his <lb/>
sister&mdash;a little girl in a ragged <hi rend="italic">tob</hi> or loose dress of <lb/>
red cotton, a white veil, and a most gentle pair of <lb/>
large black eyes. The boy, when bringing in the girl, <lb/>
said, "This is Fatmah." The little fellow, who loved <lb/>
his sister with all the warmth of his heart, thought <lb/>
he had only to announce her name and that was <lb/>
sufficient to obtain for her a generous welcome. He <lb/>
<pb n="138" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0145"/>
often indulged his love for the girl by calling at the <lb/>
school, just to see how she was getting on. Hearing <lb/>
from his sister that some prizes were to be given to <lb/>
the children, he took the opportunity when out with <lb/>
his donkey of bespeaking a good prize for Fatmah. <lb/>
"Had not the lady herself said that Fatmah was <lb/>
good?" This little fellow's affection for his sister <lb/>
drew Miss Whately's attention more directly to the <lb/>
boys, and probably was the first inducement to <reg orig="estab-|lish">establish</reg> <lb/>
a school for them in Egypt. The boy had a <lb/>
singular name&mdash;Abdul Leyl &lpar;Servant of the Night&rpar; <lb/>
&mdash;an uncommon one even in Egypt, where strange <lb/>
names are so general.</p>
<p>The boys of Egypt&mdash;the real city Arabs&mdash;are not <lb/>
subjected to so much privation as their namesakes in <lb/>
London and other large cities. The food which they <lb/>
eat and enjoy&mdash;bread and onions, and when in season, <lb/>
sugar-cane and cucumbers&mdash;can be obtained at very <lb/>
low rates. It is true they are not overburdened with <lb/>
clothes; but then the climate is so warm that this is <lb/>
not considered a very great hardship. His moral <lb/>
condition, however, is deplorable. When not running <lb/>
after his donkey, he rolls about in the dust, or lounges <lb/>
with his companions, who, like himself, are clad in <lb/>
ragged blue shirts or old rough garments of hair, with <lb/>
a dirty cap or towel tied round the head by way of a <lb/>
turban. Instruction or teaching he has in reality <lb/>
none; and were it not for the efforts now being made <lb/>
to carry the gospel to Egypt, the little Arabs of that <lb/>
<pb n="139" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0146"/>
country would die, pretty much as they lived, a little <lb/>
removed from the animals they ran after and <reg orig="bela-|boured">belaboured</reg>.</p>
<p>Miss Whately, in her endeavours to establish her <lb/>
school, had to put up with disappointments and many <lb/>
vexatious circumstances. For a time, everything <lb/>
went on to her wish; then, without any known <lb/>
cause, the scholars began to fall off day by day. The <lb/>
report that she intended to kidnap the children, <lb/>
which had at the first caused the mothers to <reg orig="with-|hold">withhold</reg> <lb/>
their little ones, had worn away. There was, <lb/>
however, some cause for the desertion of the school; <lb/>
what it was, Miss Whately was resolved to find out. <lb/>
One broiling hot morning, therefore, she started upon <lb/>
a journey of discovery. The first place visited was <lb/>
a lane called "Aboukakr," where the children literally <lb/>
swarm on the ground. The lane is so narrow that <lb/>
the houses touch each other, which are all in a state <lb/>
of disorder and wretched decay. When inquiring for <lb/>
the residences of the scholars from some children who <lb/>
were rolling about upon a heap of rubbish, a woman's <lb/>
voice was heard calling to her from above. Her <lb/>
little guide, Menni, one of her scholars, would have <lb/>
prevented her going. "They are Moslems," she <reg orig="hur-|riedly">hurriedly</reg> <lb/>
whispered. The room was entered from some <lb/>
broken steps and a mud terrace, which was falling to <lb/>
pieces. Several persons were sitting on the floor&mdash; <lb/>
an old man smoking a long pipe, and several women, <lb/>
some with infants in their arms. Altogether about <lb/>
<pb n="140" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0147"/>
fourteen persons crowded the room. "Little teacher," <lb/>
said one, patting Menni on the back. "Let us go <lb/>
away," whispered the girl; "they are Moslems, and <lb/>
will only laugh at us." A stout woman squatted <lb/>
down in front of Miss Whately, and after <reg orig="patroniz-|ingly">patronizingly</reg> <lb/>
patting her on the back, told her to "speak." <lb/>
Making the best use of her limited knowledge of <lb/>
Arabic, she told them about the school, and that she <lb/>
had come out to induce the mothers to send their <lb/>
children. The fat woman, having listened thus far, <lb/>
wanted to know if the gown she wore was sewed by <lb/>
herself, what it was made of, and all about it. When <lb/>
this topic was exhausted, Miss Whately was told <lb/>
good-humouredly "to go on speaking."</p>
<p>"Well, in our school we have one book from which <lb/>
we teach."</p>
<p>"Listen! listen!" exclaimed the fat woman; "she <lb/>
says there is <hi rend="italic">one</hi> book."</p>
<p>"Yes; and it is the Book of God."</p>
<p>"Listen; she says it is the Book of God."</p>
<p>"All in it is good."</p>
<p>"Certainly," cried the woman, "it must be good."</p>
<p>"It speaks of Moses, of Joseph, of the prophet David."</p>
<p>"Listen," cried the echo; "this Book tells of the <lb/>
prophets David and Moses, and also of Joseph."</p>
<p>"But, more than this, the Book I speak of contains <lb/>
the gospel also, which tells of Jesus, the Messiah; <lb/>
how he came from heaven, and died for us, and how <lb/>
good he was."</p>
<pb n="141" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0148"/>
<p>Miss Whately then explained that the Bible taught <lb/>
us to know and love God; and that if their children <lb/>
did not love God they could never be good.</p>
<p>"Do you pray?" asked the fat woman.</p>
<p>"Yes; and the girls in the school are taught to <lb/>
pray."</p>
<p>"But have you no pictures?" &lpar;meaning pictures to <lb/>
pray to&rpar;.</p>
<p>She was told that nothing of that sort was allowed; <lb/>
that it was wrong to bow down and pray to pictures.</p>
<p>"Do you beat the girls?"</p>
<p>"No, no! certainly not; we have no sticks. Books, <lb/>
needles, thimbles, pictures to teach with, but no <lb/>
sticks.</p>
<p>All the party laughed at this, and amid many <lb/>
friendly "salaams," the women dispersed.</p>
<p>Then several of the scholars were met with. Some <lb/>
had stayed away from idleness, one had been detained <lb/>
at home to assist in making bread. All were pleased, <lb/>
however, at the visit of the schoolmistress, and <reg orig="pro-|mised">promised</reg> <lb/>
to return immediately. About ten o'clock, in <lb/>
proof of the success of the effort, a string of half-wild, <lb/>
untamed little girls, rushed into the schoolroom. <lb/>
They were dreadfully dirty, and had at once to <lb/>
undergo a cleansing process at the water jar. They <lb/>
were all promised a treat&mdash;a visit to a garden, their <lb/>
highest idea of enjoyment&mdash;if they came regularly to <lb/>
school.</p>
<p>Just as the children were about to commence <lb/>
<pb n="142" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0149"/>
sewing, screams were heard in the lane. A crowd <lb/>
was gathered. In the midst two women were <reg orig="ob-|served">observed</reg> <lb/>
beating a young girl very furiously and tearing <lb/>
her clothes. It was poor Shoh. One of the women <lb/>
dragged her along the ground by her hair, and beat <lb/>
her when she attempted to rise. A boy in the crowd <lb/>
was instigated to rush upon her and bite her arm and <lb/>
shoulder most cruelly. The women were her mother <lb/>
and aunt, and the boy was probably her cousin. Her <lb/>
crime was that she declined to lend her aunt a new <lb/>
jacket that she had just made for herself. The sadly <lb/>
ill-used girl was got into the schoolroom&mdash;a <reg orig="deplor-|able">deplorable</reg> <lb/>
figure, with her dishevelled hair and torn and <lb/>
dusty dress, and face flushing crimson through its <lb/>
dark skin, all stained with tears and dirt. A little <lb/>
arnica and water were applied to the arm. A <reg orig="com-|posing">composing</reg> <lb/>
draught and an hour's sleep enabled her to go <lb/>
quietly home.</p>
<p>As a contrast to this sad scene, Miss Whately <lb/>
describes a little excursion made with her scholars to <lb/>
a garden. The girls were all about by six o'clock in <lb/>
the morning clamouring to start. They were sure it <lb/>
was time, "for it was daylight." A motley group <lb/>
they looked. Some had only a plain blue cotton <lb/>
robe, scanty and ragged; others had gay print <lb/>
trousers; one or two had an old tarnished <reg orig="em-|broidered">embroidered</reg> <lb/>
jacket; all had something on their heads <lb/>
by way of a veil, which every Egyptian girl knows <lb/>
so well how to put on. A crowd of boys surrounded <lb/>
<pb n="143" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0150"/>
the schoolroom door, praying to be allowed to go to <lb/>
the picnic. This could not be. Moslem prejudices <lb/>
would have been greatly shocked at the incongruity <lb/>
of mixing girls and boys in a school. The boys were <lb/>
not only anxious to join the garden party, but equally <lb/>
desirous to "come to school." About seven o'clock <lb/>
all was ready for a start. A donkey was loaded <lb/>
with carpets, and a servant carried a basket filled <lb/>
with cakes and sweetmeats. The carpets were spread <lb/>
under an immense sycamore fig-tree in a corner of <lb/>
the Esbekieh, or public garden. Coffee and cakes <lb/>
were served amid clapping of hands and great <lb/>
chattering. This over, the girls danced in a circle, <lb/>
waving little boughs in a perfect delirium of <reg orig="enjoy-|ment">enjoyment</reg>. <lb/>
The elder girls found their greatest pleasure <lb/>
in throwing their arms round Miss Whately, and, <lb/>
with eyes overflowing with affection, exclaiming, "I <lb/>
love thee; I love thee much." When it was too hot <lb/>
to walk, a ring was formed, and the girls sang an <lb/>
impromptu song,&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"The teacher has brought us to the garden,</l>
<l rend="indent">Oh, the garden, the garden," etc.</l>
</lg></q>
Then they sang, "There is a Happy Land." At ten <lb/>
o'clock, it being too hot to remain out any longer, the <lb/>
carpets were rolled up, and the happy party returned <lb/>
home. This was not the least delightful incident of <lb/>
Miss Whately's Egyptian school life. It was not all <lb/>
sad or sorrowful. There were many bright glimpses <lb/>
of happy children anxious to be led and directed. <lb/>
<pb n="144" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0151"/>
Many were the battles which had to be fought with <lb/>
prejudice and ignorance; but "the teacher" did not <lb/>
know the word&mdash;Failure.</p>
<p>Perhaps one of her most important efforts was to <lb/>
organize a "mother's meeting" in Cairo; a work of <lb/>
immense difficulty. In addition to the difficulties <lb/>
consequent upon an imperfect knowledge of Arabic, <lb/>
there was the strong stolid objection to change which <lb/>
is so general a characteristic of the Egyptians. But, <lb/>
as Miss Whately observes, a bird's nest is built a <lb/>
straw at a time; and so, little by little, prejudices <lb/>
were overcome, and the mothers were assembled in <lb/>
the schoolroom, which had been neatly decorated for <lb/>
the occasion with tamarisk boughs, a few flowers, and <lb/>
a cloth spread upon the mat. Two large bowls of <lb/>
water and a quantity of native bread were provided <lb/>
for refreshments. About fourteen mothers and <lb/>
aunts and grandmothers came to the meeting, who <lb/>
would not touch a particle of the food until their <lb/>
hostess sat down and ate with them. When all <lb/>
were seated, messes were brought in, consisting of <lb/>
gourds stuffed with rice and a little meat; stewed <lb/>
tomatoes and egg-plants; cabbage leaves filled with <lb/>
rice and onions and meat, rolled up in balls; and <lb/>
piles of rice boiled with <foreign lang="ind"><hi rend="italic">semu</hi></foreign>, or clarified butter, of <lb/>
a rather strong flavour. No knives and forks were <lb/>
used&mdash;the food was taken from the dish with the <lb/>
fingers. After the meal was over, the hands were <lb/>
washed in water provided at the door. Then, as <lb/>
<pb n="145" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0152"/>
coffee was served, the women gathered round their <lb/>
Christian friends, and listened and talked in the <lb/>
most familiar manner. The meeting concluded with <lb/>
a prayer, which was listened to most reverently. <lb/>
During its delivery many murmured assents were <lb/>
heard. As the guests departed, they kissed Miss <lb/>
Whately's hands and cheeks again and again, shedding <lb/>
tears, and uttering the words: "The Lord preserve <lb/>
thee. The Lord bless thee."</p>
<p>All this work was accomplished in six months&mdash;a <lb/>
work which will have its fruit in eternity, and which <lb/>
will be owned and honoured by the Father. That <lb/>
six months might have been spent by Miss Whately <lb/>
in the choicest society in England, amid the most <lb/>
elegant pursuits. But what employment, prompted <lb/>
by mere selfishness, could have afforded her so much <lb/>
true satisfaction and heart-felt enjoyment? Was she <lb/>
not working with the Saviour to hasten the time <lb/>
when "they shall come, which were ready to perish <lb/>
in the land of Assyria, and the outcasts in the land <lb/>
of Egypt"?</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">It</hi> is one of the most interesting and <reg orig="delight-|ful">delightful</reg> <lb/>
facts of our time, that women of <reg orig="cul-|ture">culture</reg> <lb/>
and the highest order of intelligence <lb/>
devote their energies and talents to the <lb/>
amelioration of the ills that afflict humanity. They <lb/>
pass by opportunities for indulgence in favourite <lb/>
pursuits, and seek in uncongenial and loathsome <lb/>
places the sinning and the sorrowing; and in <reg orig="help-|ing">helping</reg> <lb/>
and aiding them they find the reward which ever <lb/>
accompanies the performance of duty. They follow <lb/>
<pb n="147" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0154"/>
the example of their Divine Master, who "went about <lb/>
doing good." The wisest of these moral reformers <lb/>
are those who seek the evil at its root, rather than <lb/>
attempt its cure when developed. The twig may be <lb/>
bent, but the oak cannot be twisted. Habits in youth <lb/>
may be controlled and directed, which, in the man, <lb/>
become the confirmed condition of life. The reformer <lb/>
of old men and women has a profitless and an almost <lb/>
hopeless task. This fact, no doubt, induced Miss <lb/>
Mary Carpenter to devote her life to the reformation <lb/>
and improvement of the children of the most <reg orig="danger-|ous">dangerous</reg> <lb/>
classes of society in England and in India&mdash;a <lb/>
work in which she was singularly successful, and <lb/>
which was productive of permanent blessed results <lb/>
for both countries.</p>
<p>Mary Carpenter was born at Exeter on the 3rd of <lb/>
April 1807, and was the daughter of Dr. Lant <reg orig="Car-|penter">Carpenter</reg>, <lb/>
a minister in that city, who is remembered <lb/>
and his memory cherished as a man of great mental <lb/>
attainments, of singular purity of motive and <reg orig="unself-|ishness">unselfishness</reg> <lb/>
of life, and the possessor of a wide, loving, <lb/>
philanthropic spirit. It is sad to think that this <lb/>
good man was lost at sea, between Naples and <reg orig="Leg-|horn">Leghorn</reg>, <lb/>
on the night of the 5th of April 1840, when on <lb/>
a foreign tour for the recovery of his health, which <lb/>
had become impaired by his many labours. While <lb/>
he lived, however, his daughter was the object of <lb/>
his constant care. How successful he was in <reg orig="impart-|ing">imparting</reg> <lb/>
his spirit, and creating within her the thoughts <lb/>
<pb n="148" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0155"/>
which animated his life, was seen in her devotion <lb/>
to duty, and in her many loving efforts to cleanse <lb/>
the world of its sin and foulness. After her dear <lb/>
father's death, she always cherished the consciousness <lb/>
of his presence. "I am separated from him," she <lb/>
wrote, "only when that intervenes which is not of <lb/>
his spirit." How deeply she was impressed and <lb/>
influenced by the loving teaching and companionship <lb/>
of her father is manifested in her "Voices of the <lb/>
Spirit and Spirit Pictures," which she left as a last <lb/>
expression of her thoughts and feelings. Much of <lb/>
the affection which existed between Dr. Carpenter <lb/>
and his daughter was owing to the illness of Mrs. <lb/>
Carpenter, which prevented that personal maternal <lb/>
care in Mary's education which her loving mother <lb/>
would, had she been physically able, so gladly have <lb/>
given. Mary Carpenter was, therefore, when very <lb/>
young, associated with the youths who received their <lb/>
education from her father, and consequently was <lb/>
instructed in many subjects not usually taught to <lb/>
girls. While studying Latin, Greek, and mathematics, <lb/>
for which she early manifested great aptitude, she <lb/>
was intrusted with the instruction of her father's <lb/>
youngest pupils&mdash;a task which she found very <reg orig="con-|genial">congenial</reg> <lb/>
to her tastes and desires. Many of her <reg orig="fellow-|pupils">fellow-pupils</reg>, <lb/>
and those to whom she imparted instruction, <lb/>
have since risen to considerable eminence, and have <lb/>
not been chary in acknowledging their obligations to <lb/>
Mary Carpenter.</p>
<pb n="149" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0156"/>
<p>Amongst the earliest of her most useful works, to <lb/>
which she was devotedly attached, was teaching in <lb/>
the Sunday school connected with her father's chapel. <lb/>
It was this labour of love which no doubt impelled <lb/>
and inspired the subsequent great work of her life. <lb/>
But Miss Carpenter was not satisfied with the Sunday <lb/>
teaching merely; she followed her scholars to their <lb/>
homes, sought and obtained the friendship of their <lb/>
parents, and helped them in their circumstances by <lb/>
aiding them to help themselves.</p>
<p>How lovingly the father was endeared to his <lb/>
daughter; and the expectations concerning her which <lb/>
he cherished from her disposition and character <lb/>
may be inferred from the letter which he addressed <lb/>
to her on the completion of her twenty-first year: <lb/>
"May He who has given thee a heart to love and <lb/>
serve him, make thee more and more a partaker of <lb/>
the mind which was in Christ Jesus, and thus <reg orig="pre-|pare">prepare</reg> <lb/>
thee for a better world, and, if it be his will, for <lb/>
usefulness and blessedness in this; preserve thee to <lb/>
be thy parents' comfort and friend, the affectionate, <lb/>
watchful, judicious friend of thy sisters and brothers, <lb/>
and the Christian friend and adviser of many more. <lb/>
We know not what is the path in which thou wilt <lb/>
be called to tread; but we feel all earthly solicitude <lb/>
swallowed up in the desire that thou mayest be the <lb/>
faithful servant of Christ, and mayest be enabled, <lb/>
while working out thine own salvation, and going <lb/>
on towards Christian perfection, to work for others <lb/>
<pb n="150" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0157"/>
the work assigned thee, and faithfully, calmly, and <lb/>
perseveringly do the Lord's will."</p>
<p>When her father relinquished his school in 1829, <lb/>
Mary, with her mother and sisters, opened one for <lb/>
young ladies. But this school, with its many cares <lb/>
and absorbing interests, was not allowed to interfere <lb/>
with or prevent her accustomed Sunday duties, or <lb/>
her week-day visits to her scholars and their parents.</p>
<p>In the year 1833, Mary Carpenter became <reg orig="ac-|quainted">acquainted</reg> <lb/>
with two distinguished persons who visited <lb/>
Bristol, and who made an impression upon her <lb/>
thoughtful mind which continued to the end of her <lb/>
life. <hi rend="italic">Rammohun Roy</hi>, so celebrated as a religious <lb/>
teacher in India, and who deservedly earned the <lb/>
title of "the great Hindu Reformer," visited Bristol <lb/>
mainly that he might profit by the conversation of <lb/>
Dr. Carpenter. Mary had frequent opportunities of <lb/>
being present upon many interesting occasions, when <lb/>
the graces and humility of Rammohun Roy's <reg orig="char-|acter">character</reg> <lb/>
were exhibited. But in the midst of much <lb/>
delightful and improving converse, the Hindu was <lb/>
struck down by mortal disease&mdash;death claimed him <lb/>
as his own, while he was yet on the threshold of <lb/>
what was anticipated as a long and useful life. The <lb/>
impression made upon Mary by the death of this <lb/>
great and good man was never afterwards erased. <lb/>
Thirty years subsequently she wrote: "It would be <lb/>
vain to attempt to describe our emotions on finding <lb/>
that this champion of truth had burst through all <lb/>
<pb n="151" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0158"/>
the fetters of prejudice and conventionality, had <lb/>
crossed the ocean, had come to our England; or the <lb/>
grief and perplexity with which his death filled all <lb/>
hearts, and the darkness which seemed to brood over <lb/>
the future of India." Mary, by the death of the <lb/>
great Hindu, was inspired to write several sonnets, <lb/>
which were read by her father at the funeral: one <lb/>
of them indicates her trust and confidence that even <lb/>
the death of Rammohun Roy would be blessed to his <lb/>
countrymen:&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"Thy spirit is immortal, and thy name</l>
<l>Shall by the countrymen be ever blest;</l>
<l>E'en from the tomb thy words with power shall rise,</l>
<l>Shall touch their hearts, and bear them to the skies."</l>
</lg></q>
Little did Miss Carpenter then think that she would <lb/>
labour in India&mdash;that she would follow in the <reg orig="foot-|steps">footsteps</reg> <lb/>
of Rammohun Roy, and carry to his <reg orig="country-|men">countrymen</reg> <lb/>
the humanizing power of a Christian education, <lb/>
which afterwards became her life-work.</p>
<p>Not less important in the formation of Miss <reg orig="Car-|penter's">Carpenter's</reg> <lb/>
Christian principles was the visit to her <lb/>
father of the eminent American, Dr. Tuckerman. <lb/>
This distinguished minister made it the business of <lb/>
his life to carry Christian sympathy and help to <lb/>
every friendless child of misery whom he could find <lb/>
willing, or even unwilling, to receive it. He believes <lb/>
pre-eminently in the power of love&mdash;that there is "a <lb/>
soul of good in things evil," and that faith and effort <lb/>
will remove mountains of ignorance and sin. This <lb/>
Christ-like spirit Mary Carpenter imbibed. She <lb/>
<pb n="152" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0159"/>
learned to love every human being "into whom God <lb/>
has breathed his spirit:" this was the key-note of <lb/>
her character, as it became the moving spring of her <lb/>
life. The immediate result of Dr. Tuckerman's visit <lb/>
was the formation of a Working and Visiting Society, <lb/>
to carry out more systematically the labours of love <lb/>
and duty which Miss Carpenter had already <reg orig="under-|taken">undertaken</reg>. <lb/>
The most wretched part of Bristol was <lb/>
divided into districts; the worst and most degraded <lb/>
was selected by her in order to test the experience <lb/>
she had received. This work she continued <reg orig="unremit-|tingly">unremittingly</reg> <lb/>
for many years, in addition to her week-day <lb/>
and Sunday-school labours. It was very much at <lb/>
her instance and suggestion that a domestic mission <lb/>
was established, which carried the gospel to the <lb/>
homes and hearts of the poorest and most degraded.</p>
<p>Hitherto, however, Miss Carpenter had worked <lb/>
amongst the respectable poor; but there was still a <lb/>
lower deep from whence sprang the many evils which <lb/>
afflicted society. Her next efforts, therefore, were <lb/>
directed to the rescue of the children growing up in <lb/>
an atmosphere of ignorance, vice, and brutality. She <lb/>
had heard of the ragged schools established in <reg orig="Lon-|don">London</reg> <lb/>
in 1846, and of similar schools in Edinburgh, <lb/>
Glasgow, and Aberdeen, and she resolved upon the <lb/>
creation of a ragged school in Bristol. By the aid of <lb/>
Christian friends, a school was soon opened in the <lb/>
locality where it would be most useful, and a master <lb/>
secured who had a special aptitude for dealing with <lb/>
<pb n="153" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0160"/>
"street arabs;" the character of the scholars who <lb/>
entered the school. This school, to which Miss <reg orig="Car-|penter">Carpenter</reg> <lb/>
devoted much time and thought, became a <lb/>
great moral success; its beneficial influence upon the <lb/>
neighbourhood was acknowledged by the police. But <lb/>
Miss Carpenter was not satisfied with aiding the <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">occasionally</hi> criminal class: she knew that there was <lb/>
a still lower deep, the <hi rend="italic">permanently</hi> criminal class, <lb/>
which cannot be reached by ordinary means. This <lb/>
class became the object of her special study. She <lb/>
communicated with the most eminent philanthropists <lb/>
who had devoted their lives to the humane work of <lb/>
rescuing their fellow-creatures; and searched out the <lb/>
haunts of juvenile criminals in the lanes and alleys <lb/>
of Bristol, venturing fearlessly alone where <reg orig="police-|men">policemen</reg> <lb/>
were afraid to go singly. In this work Miss <lb/>
Carpenter spent five years, her knowledge and <reg orig="con-|viction">conviction</reg> <lb/>
of what might be done growing and <reg orig="increas-|ing">increasing</reg> <lb/>
with her constantly acquired experience. At <lb/>
this period juvenile crime was increasing instead of <lb/>
decreasing: schools, penitentiaries, and jails were <reg orig="in-|effective">ineffective</reg> <lb/>
to stay the current of crime which pervaded <lb/>
the country. The question was often asked, "Could <lb/>
not some more successful remedy be devised to meet <lb/>
the growing evil?"</p>
<p>This question Miss Carpenter set herself to answer <lb/>
in a work which she published in 1851, entitled, <lb/>
"Reformatory Schools for the Children of the <reg orig="Per-|ishing">Perishing</reg> <lb/>
Classes, and for Juvenile Offenders." This <lb/>
<pb n="154" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0161"/>
work admirably summarized the various attempts <lb/>
that had been made to reform criminal children, <lb/>
and laid down principles, which subsequent <reg orig="experi-|ence">experience</reg> <lb/>
demonstrated were the only true principles, <lb/>
which promised success. First, it was clearly <reg orig="demon-|strated">demonstrated</reg> <lb/>
that, however vicious and degraded children <lb/>
may have become, they are capable of being brought <lb/>
under moral and religious control; and, secondly, in <lb/>
order to obtain success, those who engage in the <lb/>
work must have <hi rend="italic">faith</hi> in its possibility, <hi rend="italic">knowledge</hi> <lb/>
for guidance, the inspiration of <hi rend="italic">love</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">patience</hi> <lb/>
to continue without weariness. Miss Carpenter <reg orig="fur-|ther">further</reg> <lb/>
advocated that the support of reformatories <lb/>
should be provided by the state; and that parents <lb/>
should be made chargeable for the maintenance of a <lb/>
child thrown by crime on the care of the state, or <lb/>
should be made to suffer in some way for the <reg orig="non-|discharge">nondischarge</reg> <lb/>
of a natural duty.</p>
<p>In 1851, Miss Carpenter became acquainted with <lb/>
Mr. Matthew Davenport Hill, who, as Recorder of <lb/>
Birmingham, had acquired a large experience on the <lb/>
subject of juvenile crime. In mutual concert Mr. <lb/>
Hill and Miss Carpenter formed the plan of a <reg orig="con-|ference">conference</reg> <lb/>
of persons interested in juvenile reformatories; <lb/>
which was held in Birmingham, and at which Miss <lb/>
Carpenter's views were unanimously endorsed. All <lb/>
attempts to induce the Government to take action in <lb/>
the formation of reformatories failed; in 1853, <reg orig="how-|ever">however</reg>, <lb/>
a Bill was introduced to the House of Commons <lb/>
<pb n="155" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0162"/>
with this object, and carried through in 1854. <reg orig="Be-|fore">Before</reg> <lb/>
this was done, Miss Carpenter had designed a <lb/>
reformatory school, which was commenced in the <lb/>
buildings formerly occupied by the Wesleyans in <lb/>
what was called the Kingswood Schools. It was <lb/>
intended that the school should be a mixed school, <lb/>
but various circumstances induced a change of the <lb/>
intention. An old Elizabethan house, called the Red <lb/>
Lodge, was purchased for a girls' school by Lady <lb/>
Noel Byron, who was much interested in Miss <reg orig="Car-|penter's">Carpenter's</reg> <lb/>
plans, the sole condition being that she <lb/>
should assume the entire management of the school. <lb/>
The institution was opened in the December of 1854, <lb/>
with ten girls; in 1856 the number had increased to <lb/>
fifty-two, afterwards to sixty. Just, however, when <lb/>
the school had been brought into working order, <lb/>
Miss Carpenter was struck down by an attack of <lb/>
rheumatic fever, which so seriously affected her heart <lb/>
that for many weeks she seemed hanging between <lb/>
life and death. She never afterwards entirely <reg orig="recov-|ered">recovered</reg> <lb/>
her former health: her sudden death is <reg orig="attri-|buted">attributed</reg> <lb/>
to the injury her constitution received during <lb/>
this sad illness. No sooner, however, had she <reg orig="recov-|ered">recovered</reg>, <lb/>
or partially recovered, than she entered again <lb/>
upon her work with added zest and zeal; immediately <lb/>
finding, in the success which followed, that reward <lb/>
which she earnestly coveted.</p>
<p>Mary Carpenter had, indeed, no other object in <lb/>
her daily life than usefulness. Praise and applause <lb/>
<pb n="156" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0163"/>
were to her, save in the still, small voice inspired by <lb/>
the Master, meaningless; though probably no woman <lb/>
was ever more gifted with the capability of <reg orig="achiev-|ing">achieving</reg> <lb/>
success than she was. The power that she <reg orig="pos-|sessed">possessed</reg> <lb/>
was derived from her <hi rend="italic">faith</hi> and life,&mdash;strong <lb/>
conviction that "there is a holy spot in every child's <lb/>
heart," and that the teacher's first duty is to find it, <lb/>
and then successful controlling and directing of the <lb/>
life has begun. Mary Carpenter possessed in an <lb/>
eminent degree the needed insight and penetration <lb/>
which enabled her to discover the "holy spot" which <lb/>
would prove the key to moral improvement. Thirty <lb/>
years of educational work had given her much <reg orig="expe-|rience">experience</reg> <lb/>
in moulding and forming the characters of the <lb/>
most neglected children; the great secret of her <reg orig="suc-|cess">success</reg>, <lb/>
however, was her deep store of <hi rend="italic">love</hi> and <hi rend="italic"><reg orig="sym-|pathy">sympathy</reg></hi>, <lb/>
which was never exhausted, and never uselessly <lb/>
employed. She had patience, unwearied diligence, <lb/>
and unswerving, reliant faith in inherent goodness, <lb/>
which, to some extent, she believed to be possessed <lb/>
by every human being.</p>
<p>When, in 1856, Miss Carpenter attained her fiftieth <lb/>
year, her mother died, leaving her without any family <lb/>
ties to interfere with the work of her life, to which <lb/>
she was devoted in heart, intellect, and spirit; "<reg orig="find-|ing">finding</reg>," <lb/>
as her brother, Dr. Carpenter, said, "in the <lb/>
variety of its objects that recreation which others <lb/>
seek in lighter pursuits." She then removed into a <lb/>
house adjacent to the Red Lodge, over which she <lb/>
<pb n="157" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0164"/>
was enabled to exercise a more direct supervision, <lb/>
making her own home a part of her reformatory <lb/>
system. Previously she had obtained a small house, <lb/>
which had been occupied by undesirable neighbours: <lb/>
those girls who had manifested improvement in the <lb/>
lodge were promoted to the cottage, where they were <lb/>
under less restraint. This promotion was much <lb/>
desired by the girls, while to be sent back to the <lb/>
lodge, owing to any misconduct, was a severely felt <lb/>
punishment. Miss Carpenter then established a still <lb/>
greater reward for good conduct;&mdash;two girls at a <lb/>
time were received into her own house and placed <lb/>
under the care of her housekeeper, who trained them <lb/>
for domestic service. Notwithstanding that the girls <lb/>
were still "under sentence," they were allowed the <lb/>
liberty granted to domestic servants: they were sent <lb/>
about the town upon errands, and intrusted with <lb/>
money. Visitors were astonished to learn that the <lb/>
cheerful, interesting girls that waited upon them had <lb/>
been convicted as thieves, and wondered how the <lb/>
miracle of reformation had been effected. The secret, <lb/>
if it was a secret, was to be found in the love and <lb/>
sympathy exercised by Miss Carpenter towards the <lb/>
most degraded of her fellow-creatures. The Red <lb/>
Lodge Reformatory has to the present been carried <lb/>
on with a success which has been most gratifying. <lb/>
Hundreds of girls have been rescued from lives of <lb/>
shame and infamy, and are now occupying <reg orig="honour-|able">honourable</reg> <lb/>
and respectable positions in domestic service; <lb/>
<pb n="158" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0165"/>
or, as wives and mothers of families, are now <reg orig="realiz-|ing">realizing</reg> <lb/>
the best hopes of the noble-hearted woman who <lb/>
for more than twenty years devoted every energy of <lb/>
her admirable life to their welfare. Herself <reg orig="child-|less">childless</reg>, <lb/>
there are multitudes of children who will "arise <lb/>
up and call her blessed." In all this humane and <lb/>
truly Christian work, it is needless to say, no personal <lb/>
or selfish thought ever intruded upon her labours. <lb/>
The salary supplied by Government for a lady <reg orig="super-|intendent">superintendent</reg> <lb/>
was not appropriated to her own use by <lb/>
Miss Carpenter. It was invariably spent upon the <lb/>
institution, upon kindred objects, and a portion laid <lb/>
by against the time when a larger salary would have <lb/>
to be paid to a superintendent who would take her <lb/>
place.</p>
<p>The success of the Red Lodge Reformatory induced <lb/>
Miss Carpenter to consider the condition of a class <lb/>
which was not criminal, but from which the criminal <lb/>
class was largely fed. With a view to aid and reform <lb/>
the "street arabs," she, in connection with her friends, <lb/>
devised the Industrial Schools Act, which gives power <lb/>
to magistrates to place in such schools children found <lb/>
by the police habitually in the streets. The Act <lb/>
came into force in 1857, when the Bristol Industrial <lb/>
School for boys was forthwith opened under Miss <lb/>
Carpenter's charge. Subsequently it was taken <lb/>
charge of by a committee, without losing the benefit <lb/>
of Miss Carpenter's vigilant supervision and <reg orig="intelli-|gent">intelligent</reg> <lb/>
oversight. The boys trained in the school, on <lb/>
<pb n="159" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0166"/>
leaving, had no difficulty in obtaining situations <lb/>
either in the maritime service, or in Canada, or in <lb/>
the United States.</p>
<p>As these schools were intended for boys only, and <lb/>
as experience had shown their value as preventives <lb/>
of crime, Miss Carpenter suggested and prompted <lb/>
the formation in Bristol of a Girls' Industrial School. <lb/>
Being then on the eve of departing for India, she <lb/>
could not actively engage in the work herself; she, <lb/>
however, drew up a plan for its establishment, and <lb/>
secured the co-operation of a ladies' committee, which, <lb/>
in the autumn of that year, 1866, opened a school <lb/>
which has since been carried on with most <reg orig="satisfac-|tory">satisfactory</reg> <lb/>
results. How satisfactory, may be inferred from <lb/>
a remark made by the Government inspector when <lb/>
visiting the schools: "We shall not want any more <lb/>
reformatories; the industrial schools are stopping <lb/>
the supply."</p>
<p>When Mr. Forster's Education Act came into force, <lb/>
which gave to local boards compulsory power to <lb/>
educate the poorest children, the grants to ragged <lb/>
schools were withdrawn. This induced Miss <reg orig="Car-|penter">Carpenter</reg> <lb/>
to place her ragged school on the footing of a <lb/>
day industrial school, similar to the school established <lb/>
thirty years previously in Aberdeen, the children <lb/>
being fed and kept in the school the whole day. <lb/>
The Education Department would give no help, and <lb/>
the Bristol School Board was prevented by the Act <lb/>
from doing so, the Poor Law Board being exactly in <lb/>
<pb n="160" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0167"/>
the same condition. Finally, Miss Carpenter <reg orig="con-|vinced">convinced</reg> <lb/>
Lord Sandon, by the five years' results of the <lb/>
Bristol Day Industrial, that the objections to her <lb/>
system were merely theoretical, and had no basis in <lb/>
actual facts. The Legislature at length yielded to <lb/>
her arguments, and consented to give the plan she <lb/>
originated a fair trial. The existing system of <reg orig="legis-|lative">legislative</reg> <lb/>
prevention of crime, as well as the reformation <lb/>
of the criminal class, was the result of Miss <reg orig="Carpen-|ter's">Carpenter's</reg> <lb/>
thirty years' self-imposed labours. She, and <lb/>
she alone, was not only the <hi rend="italic">animating spirit</hi>, but <lb/>
the <hi rend="italic">directing intellect.</hi></p>
<p>When attending the Social Science Association in <lb/>
Dublin in 1861, she had her attention directed to <lb/>
the reformatory system for adult criminals in the <lb/>
Irish convict prisons, founded by Sir Walter Crofton. <lb/>
Recognizing the principles which had prompted her <lb/>
own reformatory efforts, she immediately commenced <lb/>
to urge upon the public, both at home and abroad, <lb/>
the importance of prison reforms. In 1864 she <reg orig="pub-|lished">published</reg> <lb/>
a work in two volumes, entitled "Our <reg orig="Con-|victs">Convicts</reg>;" <lb/>
and opened a correspondence with prison <lb/>
reformers in almost every country in Europe, in <lb/>
India, the British colonies, and the United States. <lb/>
In 1872 she took an active part in the International <lb/>
Conference held in London on prison systems, <reg orig="pre-|paring">preparing</reg> <lb/>
for the information of those who attended the <lb/>
conference a little book on "The Crofton Prison <lb/>
System." In the following spring she visited the <lb/>
<pb n="161" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0168"/>
United States and Canada to obtain information on <lb/>
the subject of prisons, and to spread a knowledge of <lb/>
the principles she advocated.</p>
<p>Recognizing the necessity of social meeting-places <lb/>
for working-men, in order to prevent them from <lb/>
going to the public-house, she built in 1864 a <reg orig="Work-|man's">Workman's</reg> <lb/>
Hall in Bristol; but as it did not prove so <lb/>
successful as she desired, it was converted into an <lb/>
industrial day-school. A Home for Boys was opened <lb/>
next door to it, which was available to boys in <reg orig="regu-|lar">regular</reg> <lb/>
employment during the day, but who had no <lb/>
parents, or bad parents, and therefore no homes <lb/>
worthy of the name to go to. This institution <reg orig="an-|swered">answered</reg> <lb/>
the most sanguine expectations of its <reg orig="benev-|olent">benevolent</reg> <lb/>
founder, and was no doubt the means of <reg orig="pre-|venting">preventing</reg> <lb/>
much crime, and inciting to lives of industry <lb/>
and probity.</p>
<p>When Miss Carpenter had attained her sixtieth <lb/>
year she had the satisfaction of knowing that her <lb/>
various humane schemes for the amelioration of <reg orig="suf-|fering">suffering</reg>, <lb/>
and the prevention of crime, had been <reg orig="success-|ful">successful</reg> <lb/>
beyond her most sanguine expectations. But <lb/>
instead of resting satisfied with the labours of the <lb/>
past, she resolved upon a visit to India, with the <lb/>
view, in the first instance, of acquainting herself with <lb/>
what was being done in that vast country for <reg orig="educa-|tion">education</reg>, <lb/>
for juvenile reformation, and for prison <reg orig="disci-|pline">discipline</reg>. <lb/>
She met with a cordial reception from the <lb/>
highest authorities in the several presidencies, and <lb/>
<pb n="162" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0169"/>
from their subordinates, and also from the most <reg orig="in-|telligent">intelligent</reg> <lb/>
of the natives in that vast country. It was <lb/>
something new for any one to come all the way from <lb/>
England with the simple object of benefiting the <lb/>
people of India, without being either an official <lb/>
of the Government or an agent of a missionary <lb/>
society. The chief difficulty which met her at the <lb/>
outset, however, was the prejudice of the Hindus <lb/>
in favour of female ignorance, coupled with the <reg orig="in-|disposition">indisposition</reg> <lb/>
of the Government to aid her efforts in <lb/>
forming an institution for female education until the <lb/>
natives had manifested a desire, by voluntary <reg orig="contri-|butions">contributions</reg>, <lb/>
for such an institution. On her return to <lb/>
England in 1867, she published a work in two <lb/>
volumes, entitled "Six Months in India." <reg orig="Subse-|quently">Subsequently</reg> <lb/>
she visited India three several times, to aid <lb/>
by her presence the educational efforts she had <lb/>
prompted. Before the close of her last visit, a large <lb/>
number of addresses were presented to her from <lb/>
bodies of natives of the highest consideration, not <lb/>
only in the localities which she had visited, but also <lb/>
in places in which she was only known by repute. <lb/>
Many of the addresses were accompanied with <reg orig="valu-|able">valuable</reg> <lb/>
presents. She was at the same time invited to <lb/>
visit other territories by native princes. She had <lb/>
the satisfaction of knowing, on her final return to <lb/>
England, that she had laid the foundation for a <reg orig="per-|manent">permanent</reg> <lb/>
system of female education. Shortly <reg orig="after-|wards">afterwards</reg>, <lb/>
a Bill passed the Council in Calcutta which <lb/>
<pb n="163" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0170"/>
included her system of reformatories and industrial <lb/>
schools. The Secretary of State for India, who had <lb/>
frequently in the House of Lords expressed his high <lb/>
estimation of the plans proposed by Miss Carpenter <lb/>
for the elevation of the native races, requested her to <lb/>
prepare two reports, on normal schools for female <lb/>
teachers, and on prison discipline; which were placed <lb/>
before Parliament.</p>
<p>Miss Carpenter, from the commencement of the <lb/>
Social Science Association, became one of its most <lb/>
earnest supporters and most valued members. <reg orig="Ex-|cept">Except</reg> <lb/>
when away from England, she attended all its <lb/>
meetings, and contributed important papers. <reg orig="Dur-|ing">During</reg> <lb/>
the discussions in the several sections her <reg orig="ad-|dresses">addresses</reg> <lb/>
were listened to with great attention, and <lb/>
left a deep impression upon those who heard her clear <lb/>
statements and mellifluous exposition. When her <lb/>
views met with opposition, she would listen with the <lb/>
most patient attention to opposing speakers, and then <lb/>
reply in the most admirable manner to the several <lb/>
objections. She possessed in a remarkable manner the <lb/>
ease and power of the most practised debater. Much <lb/>
of this power was no doubt owing to her special <lb/>
capability of concentration. For the time she was <lb/>
possessed only with the one subject. When in <reg orig="Lon-|don">London</reg>, <lb/>
on the same morning she would have interviews <lb/>
with the heads of several Government departments, <lb/>
leaving the impression upon each that the business <lb/>
she came upon was the only thought in her mind.</p>
<pb n="164" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0171"/>
<p>For more than a quarter of a century Miss <reg orig="Car-|penter">Carpenter</reg>, <lb/>
by her public and private advocacy, influenced <lb/>
in a remarkable manner social legislation. Her <reg orig="in-|fluence">influence</reg> <lb/>
in inducing public men to adopt her views, <lb/>
and to make her objects their own, was mainly <reg orig="in-|duced">induced</reg> <lb/>
by the implicit faith and confidence which were <lb/>
placed in her. It was known that any cause which <lb/>
obtained her advocacy would only be commended <lb/>
after the most thorough examination of principles <lb/>
and details; and that her advocacy would only be <lb/>
prompted by the most enlarged philanthropy, <reg orig="with-|out">without</reg> <lb/>
the slightest trace of self-interest or personal <lb/>
distinction. When she felt that she could be of <reg orig="ser-|vice">service</reg> <lb/>
by putting herself forward, no one was more <lb/>
ready to come to the front; but when she believed <lb/>
that she could best serve her cause by keeping in the <lb/>
background, no one was more modest and retiring. <lb/>
It is interesting to know that the Birmingham <reg orig="Con-|ference">Conference</reg> <lb/>
of 1852 was the result of the joint action of <lb/>
Miss Carpenter and Mr. M. D. Hill; and although <lb/>
the scheme of reformatory and preventive legislation <lb/>
which was adopted by the conference was entirely <lb/>
the production of Miss Carpenter, her name did not <lb/>
appear in any of the invitations to the meetings. <lb/>
Much of the objection which was at one time <reg orig="enter-|tained">entertained</reg> <lb/>
to woman's advocacy of any cause was <reg orig="over-|thrown">overthrown</reg> <lb/>
by the admirable and effective labours of <lb/>
Miss Carpenter. This was accomplished not so much <lb/>
by the advocacy of what is called woman's <hi rend="italic">rights</hi> as <lb/>
<pb n="165" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0172"/>
by a practical demonstration of woman's <hi rend="italic">capabilities.</hi> <lb/>
By the express desire of the late Princess Alice, she <lb/>
attended a congress held at Darmstadt on the subject <lb/>
of "Women's Work." That visit was held alike by <lb/>
the princess and her children in affectionate <reg orig="remem-|brance">remembrance</reg>.</p>
<p>Her brother, Dr. Carpenter, writing of his sister, <lb/>
said:&mdash;"None who only knew her in public life <lb/>
could be aware how much she possessed of the <lb/>
artistic and poetic temperament, how keen was her <lb/>
enjoyment of nature, and how strongly she was <reg orig="in-|terested">interested</reg> <lb/>
in the general progress of scientific thought; <lb/>
and only those who shared her closest intimacy could <lb/>
know the depth of her religious fervour, and the <lb/>
constancy with which she humbly aimed to follow in <lb/>
the footsteps of her great Exemplar." All who knew <lb/>
her and who came into her presence found in Miss <lb/>
Carpenter a true and faithful disciple whom Jesus <lb/>
loved. It was with heartfelt thankfulness that she <lb/>
was enabled to say, in reference to her little book, <lb/>
"Morning and Evening Meditations, with Prayers," <lb/>
which had been published anonymously, "It has met <lb/>
the religious wants of persons of all denominations; <lb/>
it has comforted the mourning hours and solaced the <lb/>
dying bed of many; while it has been the closet <lb/>
companion of numbers, without respect of creed, the <lb/>
spirit knowing no distinction when in felt communion <lb/>
with its Maker." Pre-eminently Miss Carpenter's <lb/>
faith worked by love; and the love which pervaded <lb/>
<pb n="166" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0173"/>
her whole being had a singular power to create love <lb/>
in all with whom she came in contact.</p>
<p>As she neared the end of her useful life, she was <lb/>
found planning and in the midst of earnest work. <lb/>
She had just concluded a course of six lectures on <lb/>
India, at the Bristol Philosophical and Literary <lb/>
Institution, which were most enjoyable and <reg orig="instruc-|tive">instructive</reg>, <lb/>
delivered with pleasurable ease and clearness. <lb/>
Immediately afterwards she learned of the death of <lb/>
her youngest brother, Dr. Philip P. Carpenter, who <lb/>
had devoted his life, with rare energy and resolution, <lb/>
to the service of God and man. But despite some <lb/>
anxious thoughts in relation to one of her schools <lb/>
and the loss of her much-loved brother, she fulfilled a <lb/>
previously made engagement and delivered a lecture <lb/>
to a humble audience in a little chapel at Kingswood, <lb/>
on the religious aspects of India. On the next day <lb/>
she received at her house the committee of the <lb/>
National Indian Association, which owned her as its <lb/>
founder, and which was presided over by the late <lb/>
Princess Alice. A few days afterwards she met <lb/>
accidentally in the street near her residence one of <lb/>
her parliamentary friends who sympathized with her <lb/>
many philanthropic labours. That conversation was <lb/>
marked with her usual earnestness, and strong, loving <lb/>
convictions. On returning home she occupied herself <lb/>
in writing letters. When her adopted daughter last <lb/>
saw her, it was with a smile on her face. The next <lb/>
morning her work of love on earth was ended,&mdash;she <lb/>
<pb n="167" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0174"/>
had gone to reap the reward of her life of labour&mdash; <lb/>
she had fallen asleep tranquilly, to awake in the <lb/>
presence of her heavenly Father.</p>
<p>Mary Carpenter, in her many works of love and <lb/>
usefulness, had the earnest sympathy and help of the <lb/>
several members of her family. Her two sisters&mdash; <lb/>
Mrs. Herbert Thomas and Mrs. Robert Gaskell&mdash;had <lb/>
for her the most tender affection. The death of the <lb/>
former, in 1870, was a severe trial to Miss Carpenter, <lb/>
who had manifested her appreciation of Mrs. Thomas <lb/>
by dedicating to her the Home for Houseless Boys. <lb/>
The newspapers, noticing her death, said: "Though <lb/>
not so widely known as her gifted sister, Miss <reg orig="Car-|penter">Carpenter</reg>, <lb/>
her devotedness to philanthropic work has <lb/>
not been less earnest. In the cause of education her <lb/>
efforts have been constant and valuable; and the <lb/>
memory of her kindness to the poor, and of her <reg orig="self-|sacrifice">self-sacrifice</reg> <lb/>
in doing good to others, will live in many <lb/>
grateful hearts."&mdash;"Miss Carpenter, whose efforts in <lb/>
the cause of philanthropy have for so many years <lb/>
been conspicuous, always found in these efforts a <lb/>
ready and able assistant in her sister, who rivalled <lb/>
herself in deeds of benevolence and in that true <lb/>
charity which was mainly directed to the elevation <lb/>
of the poor and neglected children of our vast <lb/>
city."</p>
<p>It was by the side of this much-loved sister and <lb/>
not less loved mother that the mortal remains of <lb/>
Miss Carpenter were interred, in the beautiful <reg orig="ceme-|tery">cemetery</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="168" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0175"/>
of Arno's Vale. A large concourse of friends, of <lb/>
all grades of society, assembled at the grave to pay a <lb/>
loving tribute to one whom all felt to have been a <lb/>
personal and public benefactor. The girls and boys <lb/>
of the Red Lodge Reformatory, the boys from the <lb/>
Industrial School, the children from the Day <reg orig="Indus-|trial">Industrial</reg> <lb/>
School, and the boys from the Kingswood <reg orig="Re-|formatory">Reformatory</reg>, <lb/>
joined the mournful procession, to pay a <lb/>
last tribute to Miss Carpenter, who had devoted her <lb/>
life to the work of rescuing children from poverty <lb/>
and crime. Thus ended the life of Miss Mary <reg orig="Car-|penter&mdash;but">Carpenter&mdash;but</reg> <lb/>
not her work. That work will live in <lb/>
the reformed and purified life of many a little one <lb/>
who would otherwise have grown up in crime and <lb/>
sorrow. The aroma of that life will permeate many <lb/>
lives, and cause light and sweetness to shine and <lb/>
become developed in many a barren and insensible <lb/>
breast. At the final account, will it not be said to <lb/>
Mary Carpenter&mdash;"Inasmuch as ye have done it unto <lb/>
one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done <lb/>
it unto Me"?</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">It</hi> is often, not always, a realized truth that <lb/>
the child is father to the man. The early <lb/>
leanings and likings develop in after life <lb/>
in fixed and confirmed habits. This was <lb/>
eminently the case in the instance of Mrs. James <lb/>
Bowen Thompson, who throughout life exhibited <lb/>
and developed the character and purpose which <lb/>
rendered her so attractive in her youthful years. <lb/>
The family motto, "Dare and persevere," was <reg orig="faith-|fully">faithfully</reg> <lb/>
observed throughout her life, but ever and only <lb/>
by a humble reliance upon the arm of the Almighty. <lb/>
She ever confidently adopted the language of St. <lb/>
<pb n="170" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0177"/>
Paul,&mdash;"I can do all things through Christ, who <lb/>
strengtheneth me." When a mere child, she had been <lb/>
decoyed by a wicked woman and robbed of her <lb/>
clothes. She said, on being brought home, "I did <lb/>
cry, but I was not frightened; I knew God would <lb/>
take care of me." She early contracted a love of <lb/>
adventure and enterprise. Her nurse, who was a <lb/>
foreigner, had a store of fairy legends and tales of <lb/>
bandits; and then the ancestral traditions in "Lloyd's <lb/>
History of Wales," the stories of her father's <reg orig="High-|land">Highland</reg> <lb/>
grandmother, who had personated the Pretender <lb/>
and successfully sustained the character for several <lb/>
days; and her father's stories of the French war in <lb/>
Germany, thrilled and excited her imagination. The <lb/>
Bible stories had always for her an intense charm. <lb/>
The history of Joseph was her special delight&mdash;much <lb/>
increased by an account of the Rosetta stone, which <lb/>
had been discovered by her father's cousin, Henry <lb/>
Salt, the British consul in Egypt. A visit to the <lb/>
stone in the British Museum was always a rare and <lb/>
loved treat. In this way the East became an object <lb/>
of much interest, fostered and increased by the <lb/>
perusal of the travels of Champollion and Belzoni, <lb/>
Von Hammer and De Sacy. These studies were <lb/>
probably the incentive which induced her very early <lb/>
to write little Bible stories for children, of whom she <lb/>
was passionately fond. The order, harmony, and <lb/>
method which characterized her youthful years <reg orig="ac-|companied">accompanied</reg> <lb/>
her through life. To resolve upon any <lb/>
<pb n="171" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0178"/>
work and to commence it, were one and the same <lb/>
thing. Practically she did not understand <reg orig="procras-|tination">procrastination</reg>. <lb/>
The law and motto of her life were, "<reg orig="What-|soever">Whatsoever</reg> <lb/>
thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might;" <lb/>
and in her last Syrian school report she wrote, "Let <lb/>
no time be lost; ours may be but a brief working <lb/>
day." "Madam," said an Oriental to her one day <lb/>
when in Syria, "you are as quick in seizing <reg orig="oppor-|tunities">opportunities</reg> <lb/>
as a Frenchman is in catching fleas!" This <lb/>
was intended to be a very great compliment. Upon <lb/>
one occasion, as an instance of her promptitude and <lb/>
industry, she had induced Daoud Pasha, the great <lb/>
administrator of Lebanon, to accompany her in the <lb/>
search for a school-house in a mountain village. A <lb/>
wretchedly dirty place was selected, when the pasha <lb/>
promised to return in three days. As no aid or help <lb/>
could be obtained to clean the place, Mrs. Thompson <lb/>
tucked up her dress and commenced to clean it <reg orig="her-|self">herself</reg>; <lb/>
the lady teachers, fired with her example, also <lb/>
set to work. When the pasha returned he found all <lb/>
neat and clean, and the school comfortably arranged, <lb/>
with a dozen happy children seated on the forms. <lb/>
"This," said the pasha with astonishment,&mdash;"this is <lb/>
administration; this is work." Another instance of <lb/>
her energy is recorded. She had heard that a collection <lb/>
was being made to enable a poor woman to visit her <lb/>
husband, a sergeant, who was under sentence of death <lb/>
at Winchester for the murder of a woman while in a <lb/>
fit of drunkenness. He had got a wound in the head <lb/>
<pb n="172" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0179"/>
in the Crimea, which had induced the doctor to <lb/>
caution him never to drink. This fact had not been <lb/>
brought out at the trial. Elizabeth immediately, in <lb/>
company with a friend, called at the Home Office <lb/>
and stated the case to the Home Secretary. She <lb/>
was desired to state the facts in writing; and then, <lb/>
on the day previous to that appointed for the <reg orig="execu-|tion">execution</reg>, <lb/>
she had the satisfaction to know that a reprieve <lb/>
from the Queen had been obtained. None at that <lb/>
period of her life ever came within her influence <lb/>
without an abiding impression of her strong and <lb/>
resolved character, her simple truthfulness, her <reg orig="in-|dustry">industry</reg> <lb/>
and worth, manifested in constant works of <lb/>
love and duty.</p>
<p>It was this constant desire to be useful which led <lb/>
her to join the Syro-Egyptian Committee, presided <lb/>
over by Sir Culling Eardley, and which resulted in <lb/>
her introduction and marriage with Dr. James Bowen <lb/>
Thompson, who had devoted himself to the Syrian <lb/>
Mission and to the hospital in Damascus. <reg orig="Subse-|quently">Subsequently</reg> <lb/>
she proceeded with her husband to <reg orig="Constan-|tinople">Constantinople</reg>, <lb/>
then to Syria, finally settling at Suediah, <lb/>
near Antioch. Here she immediately commenced <lb/>
the study of the language; and, observing the <reg orig="piti-|able">pitiable</reg> <lb/>
degradation of the women, opened a school in <lb/>
her own house, and formed little knots of readers of <lb/>
the Bible in the neighbouring districts of Kesub and <lb/>
Ain Tab. Fifteen months afterwards, in the June of <lb/>
1855, she left Antioch with her husband. A <reg orig="wonder-|ful">wonderful</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="173" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0180"/>
work had been done in those fifteen months! <lb/>
"Come back, come back soon," is heard from young <lb/>
and old, as the travellers take their departure. <reg orig="Mo-|hammedans">Mohammedans</reg>, <lb/>
Jews, and even Romanists looked <reg orig="long-|ingly">longingly</reg> <lb/>
after them, sorrowing to see their face no <lb/>
more. The inhabitants had been taught to read the <lb/>
Bible in Arabic; and a clever lad had been engaged <lb/>
to open a free school at a salary of three hundred <lb/>
piastres &lpar;&pound;3, 2s. 6d.&rpar; a year. Mrs. Thompson had <lb/>
had a very large class of girls and young women&mdash; <lb/>
Turkish, Jewish, and Armenian. They were taught <lb/>
sewing, embroidery, and the Arabic alphabet.</p>
<p>The cause of Dr. and Mrs. Thompson leaving <lb/>
Antioch was the breaking out of the war in the <lb/>
Crimea. Dr. Thompson was urged to afford his aid <lb/>
to the sufferers in the hospitals in Balaclava. Before <lb/>
his official appointment reached him, he was on his <lb/>
way to the relief of the sufferers. Soon after his <lb/>
arrival he was seized with the dreaded fever and <lb/>
sent to the hospital at Scutari; where, being a civilian, <lb/>
he was refused admittance. Before any effort could <lb/>
be made to obtain his admission, the ship was ordered <lb/>
off to Kulalee; and the poor invalid and <reg orig="broken-|hearted">broken-hearted</reg> <lb/>
wife were shut up in the close fever-stricken <lb/>
steamer! The horrors of that night were detailed in <lb/>
a letter to the Queen; to which a most gracious and <lb/>
tender answer was returned. In the morning, Lady <lb/>
Alicia Blackwood, from Scutari, brought the news <lb/>
that the patient was to be admitted to the hospital. <lb/>
<pb n="174" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0181"/>
After admission, for a time all went on well; but on <lb/>
Sunday, August 5, Mrs. Thompson wrote: "All is <lb/>
over&mdash;James has left me alone. He would willingly <lb/>
have taken me with him, and oh! how gladly would <lb/>
I have gone! but he had to go alone;&mdash;and yet he <lb/>
was not alone, his Saviour was with him." After <lb/>
she had seen the precious remains of her dear <reg orig="hus-|band">husband</reg> <lb/>
lowered into the grave, and taken a solemn and <lb/>
silent farewell, in sure and certain hope of a glorious <lb/>
resurrection, she returned to England.</p>
<p>Here, at the residence of her sister and brother-<reg orig="in-|law">in-law</reg>, <lb/>
East Coombe Park, she immediately commenced <lb/>
various schemes of usefulness. During the Indian <lb/>
Mutiny she became a member of the committee formed <lb/>
at the Mansion House by the Lady Mayoress, and at <lb/>
once suggested that ready-made articles of clothing, <lb/>
mourning, and widows' apparel, should be sent out to <lb/>
India. Personal efforts were made on behalf of the <lb/>
soldiers who were sent to the scene of action from <lb/>
Woolwich. Prayer-meetings of the men were held, <lb/>
addresses delivered, and Bibles and Testaments <reg orig="dis-|tributed">distributed</reg>. <lb/>
Then when the soldiers had embarked, the <lb/>
women and children left behind had to be cared for. <lb/>
Public meetings were held, and a ladies' visiting <reg orig="com-|mittee">committee</reg> <lb/>
was formed. The women were employed <lb/>
in making underclothing for the Government stores; <lb/>
and a small additional allowance was obtained from <lb/>
Government for each child. This accomplished, aided <lb/>
by Mrs. Angerstein she originated the Central <reg orig="Asso-|ciation">Association</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="175" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0182"/>
for soldiers' wives, under the patronage of the <lb/>
Queen.</p>
<p>In 1860 the Syrian massacre sent a chill through <lb/>
the heart of civilization. The order had been given <lb/>
to slay "every male from seven to seventy." Eleven <lb/>
thousand Christians were slain, leaving twenty <reg orig="thou-|sand">thousand</reg> <lb/>
desolate widows and orphans. Four thousand <lb/>
Christians perished from destitution, three thousand <lb/>
habitations were burned to the ground, and two <lb/>
million sterling of property was destroyed. To <lb/>
succour the wretched survivors was the duty to <lb/>
which Mrs. Thompson now devoted all her energies. <lb/>
On arriving at Beir&ucirc;t, she had pointed out to her the <lb/>
difficulties of the mission she had undertaken, and <lb/>
that she had better return by the next steamer. <lb/>
This, of course, she could not consent to do. She <lb/>
deemed that the work was deputed to her by the <lb/>
Almighty, and she would die at the post of duty <lb/>
rather than desert it. A severe attack of rheumatic <lb/>
fever laid her up, but did not shake her resolution. <lb/>
As soon as she could walk upon crutches, she took a <lb/>
house in which she could minister to the wretched <lb/>
people. In December 1860 her Industrial Home was <lb/>
opened with thirty women and sixteen children: in <lb/>
a week the numbers had swelled to two hundred. <lb/>
Numbers were even then crying for admission. "If <lb/>
you cannot," said they, "pay us for our work, only <lb/>
let us come and sit and listen; for our hearts are <lb/>
sad, and we have nothing to do." And when these <lb/>
<pb n="176" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0183"/>
poor ignorant people listened to the reading of the <lb/>
Bible, they would say: "We are like the cows; we <lb/>
know nothing." "We never heard such words." <lb/>
"Does it mean for us women?" "Now we will <lb/>
always sit here." Only a short time was required <lb/>
to teach the women and children to read. Then they <lb/>
began to read the Bible for themselves; and hymns <lb/>
of praise took the place of vows of vengeance, <reg orig="impre-|cations">imprecations</reg>, <lb/>
and idle talk. The sad, stricken creatures in <lb/>
the hospital, had much of her care, where she <reg orig="endeav-|oured">endeavoured</reg> <lb/>
to bring the "balm of Gilead" to the <reg orig="sin-|sickened">sin-sickened</reg> <lb/>
soul. A night school was opened and <lb/>
joyfully attended; but this was at great risk both <lb/>
to the teacher and the taught. Any indiscretion <lb/>
might at any moment bring the Mohammedans upon <lb/>
them.</p>
<p>The opportunities for usefulness opening so <reg orig="promis-|ingly">promisingly</reg> <lb/>
induced Mrs. Thompson to propose to her <reg orig="warm-|hearted">warmhearted</reg> <lb/>
friends at home the formation of an <reg orig="associa-|tion">association</reg> <lb/>
under Lord Shaftesbury for the establishment <lb/>
of English industrial, ragged, and evening schools in <lb/>
Syria. On the 21st December 1860 the sewing <lb/>
school for women was opened with thirty of the <lb/>
poor sufferers. About fifty others crowded round <lb/>
the door, but they had to be refused. "One poor <lb/>
woman came in," she wrote, "during a pelting rain, <lb/>
with nothing but an under garment and a few rags <lb/>
to cover her, while her sickly babe was barely covered <lb/>
with wet tatters. I took from our bundle of old <lb/>
<pb n="177" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0184"/>
clothes a little night-gown and frock, and we dressed <lb/>
the crying babe, to the great delight of all the women." <lb/>
The day before Christmas day several boxes of <lb/>
presents arrived from England&mdash;materials for dresses, <lb/>
needles, thimbles, scissors, school-books, maps, pictures, <lb/>
Bibles&mdash;all so welcome, to rejoice the hearts of the <lb/>
poor women. At the close of the year Mrs. Thompson <lb/>
secured in the environs of Beir&ucirc;t a house suited for a <lb/>
school, with workrooms for the women. So rapidly, <lb/>
however, did numbers increase that a third school had <lb/>
to be opened within a month, and Mrs. Thompson had <lb/>
to secure what assistance she could in the undertaking. <lb/>
It seemed, however, that at that time in England the <lb/>
starving condition of the Syrians excited more interest <lb/>
than their spiritual condition. &pound;50,000 had been <reg orig="sub-|scribed">subscribed</reg> <lb/>
for their temporal relief, and only &pound;110 for <lb/>
Mrs. Thompson's evangelistic work. <reg orig="Notwithstand-|ing">Notwithstanding</reg>, <lb/>
although at times she wrote despondingly, she <lb/>
converted a stable into a fourth school or workroom; <lb/>
and then immediately afterwards, in the month of <lb/>
February, an infant school had to be added, which <lb/>
in a week received ninety children; and a few days <lb/>
afterwards a set of stables were thrown into one <lb/>
large room for a fifth or young women's school. <lb/>
Frequently, girls under fourteen years of age, who <lb/>
had been rescued from the Turks, and whose parents <lb/>
had been murdered, were brought to her for clothing, <lb/>
food, and shelter. Refugees from all parts found <lb/>
their way to the schools, and followed Mrs. Thompson <lb/>
<pb n="178" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0185"/>
from room to room, entreating her to give them work <lb/>
and clothing. The schools were most encouraging. <lb/>
The personal appearance of the women, as well as their <lb/>
demeanour, was much improved. The children in the <lb/>
girls' school soon learned to read words of three letters, <lb/>
to do a little ciphering and writing on slates.</p>
<p>The people of Zachleh, hearing of the success of the <lb/>
schools at Beir&ucirc;t, were desirous that schools should be <lb/>
established there also. One of the chiefs expressed a <lb/>
wish to be under English direction, and offered his <lb/>
house, his servants, and his children to Mrs. Thompson, <lb/>
if she would only go to Zachleh. "We want a school," <lb/>
he said; "I can bring you many persons anxious to <lb/>
learn." The Jesuits had land at Zachleh, as well as <lb/>
schools and convents, and were very rich. Some <lb/>
Protestant missionaries had been there previously, <lb/>
but the priests and Jesuits had excited the children <lb/>
to throw stones at them. "But now," said one of <lb/>
the chief men, "we do not wish our children to do <lb/>
so." The way was evidently opened for the spread <lb/>
of the gospel. The truth having been proclaimed, <lb/>
and efforts put forth in the name and strength of the <lb/>
Saviour, an abundant opening was manifested on <lb/>
every hand. On the receipt of a box of Bibles at <lb/>
the schools, the women and children were anxious to <lb/>
possess the treasures. When told they would have <lb/>
to pay part of the cost, many voices were heard, <lb/>
"Kadesh? kadesh?" &lpar;"How much? how much?"&rpar; <lb/>
When told, "Ten piastres," or one shilling and <reg orig="eight-|pence">eightpence</reg>, <lb/>
<pb n="179" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0186"/>
many a sorrowful look was observed on the <lb/>
bright young faces of the children. When, however, it <lb/>
was intimated that weekly payments of a penny would <lb/>
be received, names were given in at once. The rich <lb/>
Greeks were anxious that the schools should be <lb/>
located near them, in order that their families might <lb/>
have the benefit of instruction. One reason given <lb/>
was: "We think the English religion must be the <lb/>
best, because the people speak the truth, and are <lb/>
always straightforward in their actions." The <reg orig="neces-|sity">necessity</reg> <lb/>
for religious instruction and the willingness to <lb/>
receive instruction were evidenced one day when <lb/>
Mrs. Thompson saw in one of the principal houses <lb/>
a panel-painting of the Virgin with a lamp before <lb/>
it. In answer to the question, "Why is this lamp <lb/>
burning?" the owner replied, "I do not know; it <lb/>
is the custom." A further question was: "If the <lb/>
house were to take fire, would the Virgin save you, or <lb/>
would you save the Virgin?" The answer was, <lb/>
"Of course I would save the Virgin." Then it was <lb/>
asked, "In that case who would be greater?" It <lb/>
was an honest answer which was returned&mdash;"You see <lb/>
I have never learnt." The husband of the lady who <lb/>
had answered so ingenuously, probably hearing of <lb/>
the visit, visited the schools at the time of the <reg orig="open-|ing">opening</reg> <lb/>
prayer, crying out, as he listened at the door, <lb/>
"Excellent! excellent!" When offered a hymn-book <lb/>
by one of the girls, he looked very foolish, and left <lb/>
the schoolroom, observing, "Wonderful! wonderful! <lb/>
<pb n="180" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0187"/>
Such a young child to be able to read! I cannot <lb/>
read. I do hope, madam, that you will come to our <lb/>
part of the town, and I will send you my ten <reg orig="chil-|dren">children</reg>." <lb/>
Many were the encouragements which Mrs. <lb/>
Thompson thus received. She had done all in the <lb/>
name and strength of Christ, and Christ was thus <lb/>
owning her labours.</p>
<p>On the 6th of May 1862 the Prince of Wales <lb/>
visited the schools; on which occasion sixty thousand <lb/>
persons stood on the Damascus road to welcome him. <lb/>
As soon as he approached the school, accompanied <lb/>
by his suite, the pashas and other dignitaries, the <lb/>
children struck up "God save the Queen." The <lb/>
Prince was evidently much pleased as well as <reg orig="aston-|ished">astonished</reg>. <lb/>
He bowed and acknowledged the compliment <lb/>
very graciously. The children exclaimed in English: <lb/>
"God save the Queen," "Long live the Queen,"&mdash;a <lb/>
pleasant salutation, which was most agreeable to the <lb/>
Prince. The children, at his request, read a chapter <lb/>
in Arabic, the third of John; which he observed <lb/>
they read very fluently. When the children read a <lb/>
chapter in English, the Prince inquired if they read <lb/>
by rote merely, or if they understood what they read. <lb/>
He was assured the children understood the sense of <lb/>
the words. The embroidery and needle-work were <lb/>
carefully examined. He was much pleased to learn <lb/>
that specimens had been sent to the International <lb/>
Exhibition. On the Prince departing, the children <lb/>
and women sang,&mdash; <lb/>
<pb n="181" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0188"/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"Around the throne of God in heaven</l>
<l>Thousands of children stand."</l>
</lg></q>
He warmly shook Mrs. Thompson by the hand, and <lb/>
expressed the pleasure and satisfaction he had <reg orig="re-|ceived">received</reg> <lb/>
in seeing the schools. The next day he sent <lb/>
a gift of twenty-five napol&eacute;ons, and also a large order <lb/>
for embroidery.</p>
<p>Many delightful reports reached England from Mrs. <lb/>
Thompson detailing the progress of her truly <reg orig="Chris-|tian">Christian</reg> <lb/>
work. The Syrian women and children not <lb/>
only learned to read the Bible, but to value and <lb/>
apply its truths. If, however, the work was so <reg orig="suc-|cessful">successful</reg> <lb/>
at Beir&ucirc;t, why should it not be so in other <lb/>
places? Its necessity was evidenced in the little <lb/>
village of Ain Kamyr&ecirc;h, through which Mrs. Thompson <lb/>
passed. On the women being asked what would <lb/>
become of them after they were dead? they said, <lb/>
"How should we know? we are Arabs, we are <lb/>
women." To other questions, they answered, "How <lb/>
should we know? we are like the cows, we know <lb/>
nothing." But they were most anxious to learn. <lb/>
When the fifteenth chapter of Luke was read to <lb/>
them, they listened with glistening eyes and riveted <lb/>
looks; and the men, too, who listened to the reading, <lb/>
put their names down to the number of thirty-five, <lb/>
requesting that a school might be established. At <lb/>
Hasbeya, where everything favoured the <reg orig="establish-|ment">establishment</reg> <lb/>
of a school, a room was obtained and prepared, <lb/>
new mats laid down, and the room whitewashed. On <lb/>
<pb n="182" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0189"/>
the first Monday, when the school was opened, <reg orig="be-|tween">between</reg> <lb/>
sixty and seventy boys and girls attended. But <lb/>
openings for schools were everywhere, and the calls <lb/>
for help were loud and frequent. In 1864 Mrs. <reg orig="Thomp-|son">Thompson</reg> <lb/>
had obtained the freeholds of eight schools legally <lb/>
made over to trustees. The regular scholars <reg orig="attend-|ing">attending</reg> <lb/>
were over six hundred. This was a wonderful <lb/>
work, and promised great results. Miss Whately, who <lb/>
visited the schools in 1866, expressed her surprise and <lb/>
delight at all she saw. She said Mrs. Thompson's <lb/>
work was glorious, and was quickly blessed.</p>
<p>One day the kawass of the Greek patriarch <reg orig="in-|formed">informed</reg> <lb/>
Mrs. Thompson that he intended to marry <lb/>
Aish&egrave;, one of the native teachers. "Aish&egrave;," said the <lb/>
intended husband, a fine-looking Mohammedan, and <lb/>
well to do in the world, "is a poor girl, but she can <lb/>
read and sing and sew. I shall give her all her <lb/>
clothes; I shall buy her gold bracelets and necklaces, <lb/>
and stuff to make her new gowns." On the hope <lb/>
being expressed that he would allow her to read the <lb/>
Bible, which she loved, he looked full of amazement, <lb/>
and said, "Of course; why, I am going to marry her <lb/>
because she can read, and I have seen her teach little <lb/>
children." Thus it was that these poor, down-trodden <lb/>
Syrian women were fitted to take their place as <lb/>
man's companion and helpmate. They were gradually <lb/>
emerging out of the state so graphically expressed by <lb/>
themselves&mdash;"We are women; how should we know? <lb/>
we are like the cows; we know no more than the <lb/>
<pb n="183" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0190"/>
oranges over our heads; all we know is that we die <lb/>
like the sheep."</p>
<p>Mrs. Thompson returned from England, where she <lb/>
had been upon a visit in 1866, to excite sympathy in <lb/>
her work among her own countrywomen. A recital <lb/>
of her self-denying labours produced a deep <reg orig="im-|pression">impression</reg>, <lb/>
and gave rise to branch associations in <lb/>
England and Scotland. The fruits of the seed which <lb/>
had been sown were now to be seen in every <reg orig="direc-|tion">direction</reg>. <lb/>
Applications for new schools to be opened were <lb/>
continually made. The highest ladies in the land, <lb/>
Druse and Christian, Jew and Mohammedan, were <lb/>
sent to her to be educated. In November 23, 1866, <lb/>
two large infant schools were opened in Beir&ucirc;t; upon <lb/>
which occasion a marriage ceremony was performed, <lb/>
when many beautiful Arabic and English hymns <lb/>
were sung. Delightful instances were daily <reg orig="occur-|ring">occurring</reg> <lb/>
of the value of the instruction given to the <lb/>
native children. These dear children became little <lb/>
missionaries, and carried the Word of God to their <lb/>
homes. Moslem mothers and fathers heard of the <lb/>
Messiah through the home reading of their children, <lb/>
and many thus learned the truth which made them <lb/>
free. Even the Greek priests sent their children to <lb/>
the schools, so convinced were they that good and <lb/>
not evil would result. Among the many places <lb/>
opened and craving for schools was Damascus, where <lb/>
Jews, Mohammedans, and Greeks anxiously desired <lb/>
a superior English girls' school. Thus the seed <lb/>
<pb n="184" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0191"/>
which had been sown gave promise of a plentiful <lb/>
harvest, and that very soon the harem and the home <lb/>
would resound with the praises of the Saviour. The <lb/>
one great object that Mrs. Thompson kept constantly <lb/>
in view was the training of native teachers. This <lb/>
important object was chiefly effected in the Normal <lb/>
Training Institution, where the adopted orphans, <lb/>
boarders, and pupil teachers speedily increased from <lb/>
fifty-four to seventy-seven&mdash;not too many for the <lb/>
many calls for their services or the work to be done.</p>
<p>Among other openings offered to Mrs. Thompson <lb/>
was one specially favoured by the pasha at Ain <lb/>
Zahalteh, where he accompanied her with his suite <lb/>
and soldiers, in order that the whole Lebanon might <lb/>
be impressed with the importance of the schools. On <lb/>
arriving at the village&mdash;the whole population turning <lb/>
out to receive them&mdash;the pasha and Mrs. Thompson, <lb/>
arm in arm, set out to find a suitable school-house. <lb/>
Poverty and filth met them on every side, so that <lb/>
they were constrained to return without completing <lb/>
their object. The pasha, distressed that he had <lb/>
brought Mrs. Thompson to such a place, was wishful <lb/>
that she should return, and offered her his own tent <lb/>
to rest in. It was finally arranged, however, that <lb/>
she should sleep in the church. The Druse governor <lb/>
solved the difficulty of obtaining a place for the <lb/>
school by offering for the purpose the harem part of <lb/>
his house&mdash;the ladies being willing to crowd together <lb/>
in two lower rooms, on condition that they also might <lb/>
<pb n="185" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0192"/>
be permitted to go to the school to be taught. The <lb/>
dirt, dilapidation, and vermin of the harem baffled <lb/>
description. The people, however, were amazed that <lb/>
it was needful for the ancient cobwebs to come <lb/>
down, or that certain annoying insects needed to be <lb/>
ferreted out of the crevices of the tumble-down walls. <lb/>
There was nothing for it but that Mrs. Thompson <lb/>
and her friends should tuck up their dresses, tie <lb/>
handkerchiefs over their heads, and go to work to <lb/>
clean the rooms. When the pasha returned in a <lb/>
couple of days he was amazed to see the change. <lb/>
The room was in neat order&mdash;benches, desks, <reg orig="black-|board">blackboard</reg> <lb/>
all ready for commencing the school. The <lb/>
pasha, however, seeing the earnestness which marked <lb/>
Mrs. Thompson's work, not to be outdone in a desire <lb/>
for the improvement of the poor inhabitants, ordered <lb/>
his engineers to draw plans of new schools, towards <lb/>
which he gave one thousand francs.</p>
<p>The Palm-Branch School was opened at Zahalteh <lb/>
on the 13th of October, with twenty children, <reg orig="look-|ing">looking</reg> <lb/>
neat and happy. Haleel, the native teacher, <lb/>
read a portion of Solomon's dedication of the Temple, <lb/>
and Mrs. Thompson offered up a prayer. The school <lb/>
was not free, however. The children brought five <lb/>
paras, in value one farthing, for a week's schooling. <lb/>
The children had also to pay in part for their books. <lb/>
But that pay which was much more valued by Mrs. <lb/>
Thompson were the attention and industry of the <lb/>
children, and the certainty that through them their <lb/>
<pb n="186" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0193"/>
homes and parents would be improved and blessed. <lb/>
The mothers were induced in many instances to meet <lb/>
the native teachers, to hear the Bible read. At these <lb/>
meetings many touching scenes were witnessed. As <lb/>
the teacher read to them the incidents in the life of <lb/>
Christ, the tears would be seen running down their <lb/>
cheeks in deep, heart-felt sympathy. Afterwards <lb/>
Mrs. Thompson was frequently cheered by meeting <lb/>
women in various parts of Syria who had been <lb/>
taught in the schools, and whose lives had been <reg orig="im-|pressed">impressed</reg> <lb/>
by the truths they had learned.</p>
<p>The people of Damascus, hearing of the wonders <lb/>
of the schools at Beir&ucirc;t, were anxious for the <lb/>
establishment of schools in their ancient city. They <lb/>
sent a most interesting petition to Mrs. Thompson, <lb/>
signed and sealed by forty-four inhabitants, <reg orig="com-|mencing">commencing</reg> <lb/>
with "Most respected Madam;" and, after <lb/>
detailing the necessity for schools in Damascus, and <lb/>
the opening, and the desire which was entertained for <lb/>
such schools, the petition concluded with: "We are <lb/>
such that your zeal, and that of the English societies, <lb/>
which are most famous for the promotion and aid of <lb/>
Christian instruction, will not disappoint us in this <lb/>
request. And may God the Most High prosper and <lb/>
protect your kingdom, and your respectable and <lb/>
zealous people, and preserve you. Amen. And may <lb/>
He that giveth seed to the sower, and bread to the <lb/>
eater, increase your seed, and give increase to the <lb/>
products of your righteousness. Amen."</p>
<pb n="187" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0194"/>
<p>Mrs. Thompson, in writing to her friends in England <lb/>
and Scotland, said: "The call from Damascus cannot <lb/>
fail to awaken an earnest desire in the heart of every <lb/>
Englishwoman&mdash;ay, and every noble-minded <reg orig="English-|man&mdash;to">Englishman&mdash;to</reg> <lb/>
deliver their Damascene sisters from the <lb/>
degrading bondage of the false prophet. And what <lb/>
student of his Bible, what friend of God's ancient <lb/>
people, but will feel it a privilege to send back to <lb/>
Damascus that light which, by the teaching of Paul, <lb/>
the apostle of us Gentiles, has made his own soul <lb/>
wise unto salvation?" It would have been strange <lb/>
indeed had not a response been made for Damascus&mdash; <lb/>
that city in which is the street called "Straight," in <lb/>
which the great mosque is erected upon which is <lb/>
inscribed in Greek characters,&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"Thy kingdom, O Christ, is an everlasting kingdom,</l>
<l>And thy dominion endureth throughout all ages."</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>The year 1868&mdash;the last year that Mrs. Thompson <lb/>
was permitted fully to superintend her work&mdash;was <lb/>
the most important of the years which she had spent <lb/>
in God's service. Schools were established at <reg orig="Damas-|cus">Damascus</reg> <lb/>
and Zachleh, and a wing was built for the Moslem <lb/>
school at Beir&ucirc;t. In the reports which she sent to <lb/>
England in the commencement of 1869&mdash;the last <lb/>
reports she was permitted to make&mdash;the statement of <lb/>
the work accomplished was really wonderful. <reg orig="Ele-|mentary">Elementary</reg> <lb/>

Ashrafia, Olive Branch, Ras Beir&ucirc;t, Blackheath, <lb/>
Musaitebeh, schools for the blind, the school for <lb/>
cripples, indicate the work which Mrs. Thompson <lb/>
had accomplished, and which formed the interesting <lb/>
subjects of the reports. Mr. Macgregor of the famous <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Rob Roy</hi> visited some of the schools, and recorded in <lb/>
his journal the impression of his visit in these words: <lb/>
"But there are several branch-schools besides, at <lb/>
mountain outposts, in connection with the <reg orig="head-|quarters">head-quarters</reg> <lb/>
of Mrs. Thompson's work in Beir&ucirc;t. <lb/>
These, or some of them, I hope to see. A very <lb/>
interesting but very difficult work has also been <lb/>
commenced for the blind, and one for the maimed, <lb/>
as well as that for the hapless orphans and the <reg orig="igno-|rant">ignorant</reg>. <lb/>
Mr. Mott's little class of blind men reading is <lb/>
a sight indeed for those who have eyes. Only in <lb/>
February last that poor blind fellow who sits on the <lb/>
form there was utterly ignorant. See how his <reg orig="deli-|cate">delicate</reg> <lb/>
fingers run over the raised types of his Bible, <lb/>
and he reads aloud, and blesses God in his heart for <lb/>
the precious news, and for those who gave him the <lb/>
new avenue for truth to his heart! 'Jesus Christ <lb/>
will be the first person I shall ever see,' he says, 'for <lb/>
my eyes will be opened in heaven.' Thus even this <lb/>
man becomes a missionary. Down in that dark room, <lb/>
again, below the printing-press of the American <lb/>
Mission &lpar;for <hi rend="italic">he</hi> needs no sunlight in his work&rpar;, you <lb/>
will find him <hi rend="italic">printing</hi> the Bible in raised type, letter <lb/>
<pb n="189" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0196"/>
by letter, for his sightless brethren. This is one of <lb/>
the most impressive wonders I have ever looked at. <lb/>
As we leave the place, some of the maimed and lame <lb/>
and halt scramble along the road to their special <lb/>
class for a lesson: so that all kinds of suffering are <lb/>
provided for, and the mission of Christians is <reg orig="follow-|ing">following</reg> <lb/>
closely in the actual personal work which He, <lb/>
the great Missionary himself, described as his mission <lb/>
to mankind."</p>
<p>Upon one occasion a question was put to a blind <lb/>
boy at the annual examination, when the Turkish <lb/>
official received the following touching answer: "I <lb/>
am a little blind boy. Once I could see; but then I <lb/>
fell asleep&mdash;a long, long sleep. I thought I should <lb/>
never wake. And I slept until a kind gentleman <lb/>
called Mr. Mott came and opened my eyes&mdash;not these <lb/>
eyes," pointing to his sightless eyeballs, "but <hi rend="italic">these</hi>," <lb/>
lifting up his little fingers&mdash;"these eyes; and, oh! <lb/>
they see such sweet words of Jesus, and how he <lb/>
loved the blind." Poor fellow! he was dark without, <lb/>
but the Sun of Righteousness had enlightened him <lb/>
within. He was one of the little fellows frequently <lb/>
seen with a cripple upon his back, going to the <lb/>
schools.</p>
<p>Successful as Mrs. Thompson had been in all her <lb/>
Syrian work, no part of her labours gave her more <lb/>
joy and the cause of more rejoicing than the results <lb/>
of her efforts in Damascus. The difficulties were <lb/>
great, and the obstacles seemed almost <reg orig="insurmount-|able">insurmountable</reg>; <lb/>
<pb n="190" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0197"/>
yet, as she believed, the closed door which shut <lb/>
her from the Jews and the Moslems was opened by <lb/>
the finger of God, and an abundant entrance was <lb/>
given to her. In a very short time after the opening <lb/>
of the schools in Damascus, the greater portion of the <lb/>
children attending were those of Jewish parents. <lb/>
The mothers were exceedingly anxious that their <lb/>
children should have the advantage of education of <lb/>
which they had been denied. Mrs. Thompson wrote <lb/>
regarding the Damascus school, that "the progress <lb/>
and happiness of the children, their beauty, <reg orig="intelli-|gence">intelligence</reg>, <lb/>
and affection, surpassed all I had seen in any <lb/>
school." The first difficulty that had to be overcome <lb/>
was the prejudice against the Jews. The Christian <lb/>
children did not like being associated with them. <lb/>
In a short time, however, it was seen that the <reg orig="chil-|dren">children</reg> <lb/>
of Jews were as neat and clean as the children <lb/>
of Christian parents, and no further objection was <lb/>
made. The eagerness of the Jewish mothers to have <lb/>
their children taught was most remarkable. <reg orig="Fre-|quently">Frequently</reg> <lb/>
at sunrise they would be at the schools with <lb/>
their daughters, usually lamenting that they were <lb/>
debarred from becoming scholars. The ignorance <lb/>
which was so common in the Lebanon was fed and <lb/>
encouraged by the priests. One of the pupil-teachers, <lb/>
after spending a day with her relations, reported that <lb/>
a lady had called upon her aunt, and asked had she <lb/>
yet purchased a standing-place for herself in heaven, <lb/>
as the priests had now some on sale, and were <reg orig="dis-|posing">disposing</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="191" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0198"/>
of them! It was represented that this <reg orig="pur-|chased">purchased</reg> <lb/>
possession becomes the absolute property of <lb/>
the purchaser! One poor ignorant woman&mdash;ignorant <lb/>
because not taught&mdash;had with the greatest difficulty <lb/>
obtained money to buy two feet square in Paradise <lb/>
for herself, but begged the priest to allow her little <lb/>
grand-daughter to be with her, promising to keep her <lb/>
close to her side, so as not to overstep the two feet of <lb/>
space! It was at Zachleh where this surprising <lb/>
ignorance was chiefly fostered. For ages the town <lb/>
had been subjected to the most abject priestly <reg orig="do-|minion">dominion</reg>. <lb/>
The missionaries who ventured into the <lb/>
town were stoned, and refused permission to remain. <lb/>
It was difficult, therefore, in a town so composed, to <lb/>
establish a Protestant school. In the July of 1868, <lb/>
however, a commencement was made, and a school <lb/>
was opened. Services were also held on the Sunday, <lb/>
at which the native missionaries officiated. The <lb/>
congregation at the outset numbered one hundred <lb/>
and fifty; the school was attended by one hundred <lb/>
and sixty-six pupils. This remarkable success was <lb/>
terribly galling to the priests, who well knew if the <lb/>
simple gospel were heard and believed by the <reg orig="inhabi-|tants">inhabitants</reg>, <lb/>
there would be no more sales effected of <reg orig="standing-|room">standing-room</reg> <lb/>
in Paradise! Sunday after Sunday the priests <lb/>
denounced the teachers and the Protestant schools, <lb/>
but without effect, the parents of the children saying, <lb/>
"They may as well speak to our shoes." The free <lb/>
gospel had made them free from the superstition and <lb/>
<pb n="192" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0199"/>
absurdity of the priests. The depth of this absurdity <lb/>
may be inferred from one fact. Mr. Macgregor, <lb/>
being desirous of making a sketch of the school, <lb/>
ascended a neighbouring house in order to obtain a <lb/>
good view. The owner, on learning that the artist <lb/>
was a Protestant, obtained some holy water to <lb/>
sprinkle upon the roof, and burned incense to <reg orig="de-|stroy">destroy</reg> <lb/>
the defilement! But, despite all opposition, <lb/>
the truth won its way into the hearts of the people. <lb/>
Even the church decorator, who derived his <reg orig="liveli-|hood">livelihood</reg> <lb/>
from making images and painting pictures of <lb/>
the Virgin, for the Roman Catholic chapels, heard <lb/>
and believed the gospel. He was forced to quit <lb/>
Zachleh, owing to the persecution of his relatives, <lb/>
who threatened to take his life.</p>
<p>The schools in the village of Hasbeya, at the foot <lb/>
of Mount Hermon, were a blessing to the poor <reg orig="inhabi-|tants">inhabitants</reg>, <lb/>
whose houses had been almost reduced to ashes <lb/>
in the terrible destruction of 1860. The dwellers in <lb/>
the wretched place had only one source of obtaining <lb/>
food &mdash; vine-dressing and gathering olives. When <lb/>
these failed, there was no other resource. No wonder <lb/>
that sickness and poverty were constant dwellers in <lb/>
the village, and that both old and young were <reg orig="con-|stantly">constantly</reg> <lb/>
carried to the grave. Miss Gibbons, who <lb/>
had charge of the schools, suffered much from the <lb/>
depression and sickness of the place; yet she had no <lb/>
thought of relinquishing the work. Maronites, <reg orig="mem-|bers">members</reg> <lb/>
of the Greek Church, Protestants, Druses, and <lb/>
<pb n="193" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0200"/>
Moslems were receiving instruction from her, and <lb/>
receiving it with grateful hearts,&mdash;that was a work <lb/>
she could not give up. She wrote to one of her <lb/>
friends: "It often gladdens our hearts to hear their <lb/>
young voices, as they pass our window on their way <lb/>
to the river for water, singing hymns and repeating <lb/>
texts in our own tongue. Often do we add our <lb/>
'Amen,' and breathe a prayer that God will give <lb/>
the clean heart and right spirit." But Miss Gibbons <lb/>
was not unmindful of the bodily wants of the people, <lb/>
as well as of their spiritual wants. She frequently <lb/>
invited twenty or thirty poor widows and children <lb/>
to supper, and the next day warmed up the remains <lb/>
for a plentiful dinner for the children.</p>
<p>At Mokhtara, the French nuns and priests made <lb/>
great efforts to prevent the success of the schools <lb/>
which Mrs. Thompson had established. They offered <lb/>
the owner of the schoolhouse double the rent paid for <lb/>
it, or any sum which was demanded; but the owner <lb/>
said she did not like the Jesuits, and preferred the <lb/>
English to have the school. The priests endeavoured <lb/>
to win over the poor people through their <reg orig="supersti-|tion">superstition</reg>. <lb/>
All over whom they had any influence were <lb/>
ordered to bring any Protestant books to the church; <lb/>
where they were collected in a heap and burned. <lb/>
Much anger was expressed at the burning of the <lb/>
Bibles. The priests endeavoured to silence the people <lb/>
by telling them to come to church on a certain <reg orig="even-|ing">evening</reg> <lb/>
and good reason would be given them for the <lb/>
<pb n="194" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0201"/>
act. On the evening named, the people found the <lb/>
church darkened; and on being requested to look <lb/>
through a hole in a box, they saw, as they were told, <lb/>
the fate of those who became Protestants. They saw <lb/>
a little truck full of children with Protestant books <lb/>
and Bibles thrust into a yawning gulf by horrid <lb/>
devils. Many expressed indignation at the silly <lb/>
buffoonery; others, ignorant and untaught, yielded <lb/>
to the influence of superstition.</p>
<p>Miss Lindsay, who commenced a school at Ain <lb/>
Zahalteh, had many serious difficulties to encounter, <lb/>
owing to the poverty of the inhabitants, and the <lb/>
privations to which they were subjected by the <lb/>
severity of the weather of one of the coldest winters <lb/>
ever known in the village. Almost every girl in the <lb/>
place was under instruction in the school; and the <lb/>
women cheerfully attended a Bible class on the <lb/>
Sunday. While their husbands were employed as <lb/>
muleteers, the poor women earned a scanty subsistence <lb/>
by tending the olive gardens and vineyards. Miss <lb/>
Lindsay was much encouraged in her work by the <lb/>
earnest desire expressed by the men to have copies of <lb/>
the New Testament to carry about with them in <lb/>
their journeys over the mountains. One day she <lb/>
entered into conversation with two men seated on the <lb/>
banks of a river. One of them was a Roman Catholic. <lb/>
On being asked if he had read the New Testament, <lb/>
he pulled a small one out of his girdle, saying that it <lb/>
was his constant companion. He had only borrowed <lb/>
<pb n="195" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0202"/>
it from the teacher at the Ain Zahalteh school. He <lb/>
soon had one of his own in which to read words of <lb/>
eternal life. Many blessed incidents were constantly <lb/>
occurring to cheer the heart and encourage the efforts <lb/>
of dear Mrs. Thompson. But the physical and mental <lb/>
strain to which she was exposed by her great and <lb/>
continued exertions were greater than she could bear. <lb/>
Often she exclaimed: "It is hard work; and were it <lb/>
not that it is the Lord's work, I do not think it would <lb/>
be possible to persevere. <hi rend="small-caps">Rest, rest</hi>! this is what I <lb/>
often long for; but where to find it I know not, <reg orig="un-|less">unless</reg> <lb/>
the Lord himself lay his hand upon me and give <lb/>
me rest of mind, though it be with pain of body." <lb/>
This rest came in the form of an illness, which was a <lb/>
real mercy to the dear noble woman. Not only did <lb/>
her physical frame require rest, but she wanted a <lb/>
quiet opportunity for renewed refreshment for her <lb/>
soul; and an opportunity for individual conversation <lb/>
with her pupils on the progress they were making in <lb/>
the spiritual life.</p>
<p>In the June of 1869, Mrs. Thompson left her several <lb/>
charges to her willing and earnest helpmates, on a <lb/>
visit to Constantinople, where she was most kindly <lb/>
received, and where she was introduced to Mustafe <lb/>
Lefeck Effendi, former Minister of Public Instruction, <lb/>
and for two years Turkish Ambassador at Paris; whom <lb/>
she described as "one of the most wonderful, if not <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">the</hi> most wonderful Turk of the age&mdash;a very learned <lb/>
man, a great patriot and philanthropist. He may be <lb/>
<pb n="196" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0203"/>
looked upon as the silent regenerator of Turkey. <lb/>
He is the master of many languages, modern and <lb/>
Oriental, a poet, and a lover of science. He has <lb/>
written many elementary works for schools, modern <lb/>
history, dictionaries, etc.; has translated several works <lb/>
from the English, German, French, and Spanish. His <lb/>
study, and his library especially, reminded you of the <lb/>
abode of our great English literati, while his <reg orig="ante-|room">anteroom</reg>, <lb/>
with plain oaken panels, revealed, when <reg orig="un-|locked">unlocked</reg>, <lb/>
stores of books for sale or gratuitous <reg orig="distribu-|tion">distribution</reg>." <lb/>
Many were the valuable presents of maps and <lb/>
books given to Mrs. Thompson by this enlightened <lb/>
Turkish gentleman. One of these parcels of welcome <lb/>
books was brought by a Mohammedan&mdash;a professor <lb/>
in the Boys' College at Constantinople&mdash;who said, <lb/>
after delivering the books, "Tell me, is it true that <lb/>
you have Mohammedan girls as boarders in your <lb/>
school? Well, it is wonderful. I could not have <lb/>
thought it. I hope you teach them to be useful."</p>
<p>One serious difficulty which Mrs. Thompson <reg orig="ex-|perienced">experienced</reg> <lb/>
in her Christian work of evangelizing the <lb/>
females of Syria, was that when the girls who had <lb/>
been taught in the schools reached the age of thirteen <lb/>
or fourteen, they were no longer permitted by their <lb/>
parents to attend: according to the custom of the <lb/>
country, they were then to be secluded from the gaze <lb/>
of men. It was desirable, however, that the education <lb/>
of the girls should not then cease; and many were <lb/>
the plans devised by which a <hi rend="italic">secluded</hi> school could <lb/>
<pb n="197" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0204"/>
be established. In this work the utmost care and <lb/>
secrecy had to be observed, as the parents, who sent <lb/>
their girls under the care of servants on donkeys or <lb/>
in carriages, desired that no talk of the schools or <reg orig="ex-|hibition">exhibition</reg> <lb/>
of the children should be indulged in. The <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Secluded Moslem School</hi> was therefore a strictly <lb/>
private school; but it not less answered the Christian <lb/>
intention of its benevolent founder. Arrangements <lb/>
were also commenced by the government for an <reg orig="ex-|tended">extended</reg> <lb/>
system of education for the Moslem females. <lb/>
This effort, however, came to naught, owing to the <lb/>
chief sheik stipulating that the Koran should be <lb/>
permitted to be read in the schools, and that native <lb/>
teachers should be permitted to instruct the children <lb/>
in its contents. Mrs. Thompson could not permit the <lb/>
mixture of error with truth, and the scheme in <reg orig="con-|sequence">consequence</reg> <lb/>
fell to the ground.</p>
<p>But the work of this noble woman was now nearly <lb/>
done. A sad, fatiguing journey, which had been <lb/>
accomplished during the night, from Zachleh to <lb/>
Damascus, nearly seventy miles, had left results from <lb/>
which she never recovered. Sickness, however, was <lb/>
never allowed seriously to interfere with her work; <lb/>
and in the last months of her valuable life her work <lb/>
went on with her accustomed vigour. She paid a <lb/>
visit to Constantinople, inspected the schools, had an <lb/>
interview with the Minister of Public Instruction in <lb/>
relation to the education of Moslem females, and <reg orig="con-|sulted">consulted</reg> <lb/>
the Hon. Sir Henry Elliot, the English <reg orig="Am-|bassador">Ambassador</reg>, <lb/>
<pb n="198" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0205"/>
on the subject of a promised grant of land <lb/>
for schools. On her return to her more immediate <lb/>
and loved work, she did not spare herself or relax <lb/>
her labours. She was seldom absent from the seven <lb/>
o'clock breakfast-table, afterwards conducting family <lb/>
worship, and reading the Bible with the eldest <reg orig="chil-|dren">children</reg> <lb/>
from eight to nine o'clock. The examination of <lb/>
the children in the Orphanage and Training School, <lb/>
prior to the summer holidays, which lasted three days, <lb/>
was the last personal work in connection with her <lb/>
labours in which she was permitted to take part. <lb/>
Her strength gradually failed during the summer <lb/>
months; but nothing could induce her to forego her <lb/>
labours for the dear Syrian children. When confined <lb/>
to bed her thoughts were ever going out after her <lb/>
work, contemplating some scheme for the <reg orig="enlarge-|ment">enlargement</reg> <lb/>
of her humane efforts. She then loved to have <lb/>
portions of the Word of God read to her, and hymns <lb/>
repeated by her bedside, alway realizing the presence <lb/>
and nearness of the Saviour. Thinking probably <lb/>
that a visit to England would be of service to her <lb/>
enfeebled frame, she resolved to make the attempt. <lb/>
When on board the vessel that was to convey her to <lb/>
her native shores, several attached friends would <lb/>
gladly have accompanied her to England. She <reg orig="lov-|ingly">lovingly</reg> <lb/>
resisted the offer, saying, "No, no; you are <lb/>
needed for the work <hi rend="italic">here</hi>." When she arrived at the <lb/>
house of her sister at Blackheath she felt improved <lb/>
by the voyage; but the improvement was only <reg orig="tem-|porary">temporary</reg>, <lb/>
<pb n="199" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0206"/>
so that she gradually grew weaker and weaker. <lb/>
On the night of the 20th of September she awoke her <lb/>
sister to tell her that her mind was strong and clear, <lb/>
but that her body was sinking&mdash;that she was "going <lb/>
home." The next day the physicians gave no hope&mdash; <lb/>
her stay in this world was only a question of days! <lb/>
When the sad news was told to her by her sister, she <lb/>
threw her arms around her, saying, "My sister, my <lb/>
sister, I can die; but I cannot leave you and my dear <lb/>
children far away." Nevertheless, she yielded to God's <lb/>
will. She had, however, a strong impression that <lb/>
she would recover through prayer and supplication. <lb/>
A telegram was sent to Beir&ucirc;t to gather the children <lb/>
together to pray for her&mdash;to pray without ceasing. <lb/>
Friends were requested to pray for her. Mrs. <lb/>
Thompson "was ready to depart, yet longed to abide a <lb/>
little longer in order to go back to her beloved flock <lb/>
on the Lebanon." Prayers were offered on her behalf <lb/>
in England, Scotland, and Ireland; and for a little <lb/>
while, as if in answer to prayer, her sufferings abated, <lb/>
and strong hopes were entertained that she would <lb/>
recover. While waiting her Master's will, she loved <lb/>
to hear the hymns and texts repeated which had so <lb/>
often cheered and encouraged her in her many works <lb/>
of usefulness. Frequently she was heard to repeat <lb/>
the sweet words:&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"Let but my fainting heart be blest</l>
<l>With thy sweet Spirit for its guest,</l>
<l>My God, to thee I leave the rest:</l>
<l rend="indent">Thy will be done!"</l>
</lg></q>
<pb n="200" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0207"/>
After the Lord's Supper had been administered to <lb/>
her and a few friends, she said, "I am quite ready to <lb/>
go&mdash;I have long made my peace with God through <lb/>
Christ; but I do long to go back to my dear children <lb/>
in the Lebanon, and I believe it will be for God's <lb/>
glory." Her thoughts were ever of her dear Syrian <lb/>
children, so that while lying on her sickbed she was <lb/>
much cheered and delighted to hear that one of her <lb/>
earliest friends in Syria, Mr. Selim Bistani, had <reg orig="trans-|lated">translated</reg> <lb/>
into Arabic a little work of hers, "Exercises in <lb/>
the Gospel Narrative;" for which, partly in her own <lb/>
trembling hand, she wrote a preface for the benefit <lb/>
of her "dear Syrian children." When assured by her <lb/>
physicians of the near approach of death, she <reg orig="com-|posed">composed</reg> <lb/>
herself on her pillow in calm, prayerful <reg orig="medita-|tion">meditation</reg>; <lb/>
and then, putting her hand upon the neck of <lb/>
her sister, she said, "Now, I will pray;" and in a <lb/>
prayer of assured hope she poured out her full heart <lb/>
to God, concluding in a strong, emphatic voice, "And <lb/>
now, Lord, let none of those who love me, and none <lb/>
of those who know me, ever think of me as going <lb/>
through the grave and gate of death, but through the <lb/>
gate of glory. Amen." Often, as she lay waiting for <lb/>
the pleasure of her Lord, she would say, "I am not <lb/>
going to die, I am going home." And then, desiring <lb/>
to be useful to her friends to the last moment, she <lb/>
employed herself in dictating short messages of <reg orig="com-|fort">comfort</reg> <lb/>
and encouragement. The effect of these <reg orig="death-|bed">deathbed</reg> <lb/>
counsels will only be known at the last day. A <lb/>
<pb n="201" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0208"/>
friend desiring a parting text, she replied, "'Rest in <lb/>
the Lord.'" And that rest was pre-eminently her <reg orig="por-|tion">portion</reg>; <lb/>
for she said, "The angels are very near me," <lb/>
and she seemed to realize in a remarkable degree <lb/>
the sweet presence of Jesus. On the last Sabbath <lb/>
this noble woman spent on earth she was cheered <lb/>
by a nearness to heaven, which was the foretaste of <lb/>
that life in glory upon which she was then entering. <lb/>
Among her last utterances were the words, "Glory <lb/>
be to the Father, to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost. <lb/>
&mdash;Jesus, Jesus!&mdash;Rest, rest!&mdash;Arise!&mdash;Amen." When <lb/>
she could not speak, she would throw her arms round <lb/>
the neck of her sister, and thus express her depth of <lb/>
love and spiritual joy. As the midnight hour of the <lb/>
Sabbath was departing, quietly and resignedly she <lb/>
crossed her arms upon her breast; and as she was in <lb/>
the act of commending her soul to God, her spirit <lb/>
took its departure to its eternal home.</p>
<p>The news of the death of Mrs. Thompson excited <lb/>
in Syria an intense feeling of bereavement. A funeral <lb/>
service was held both in Arabic and English, which <lb/>
was attended by a deeply interested congregation, <lb/>
composed of the natives and children who had <reg orig="sus-|tained">sustained</reg> <lb/>
so severe a loss in the death of their spiritual <lb/>
mother. But the work which she had commenced, <lb/>
which had been so full of promise, and which had <lb/>
borne such glorious fruits, was not to end because the <lb/>
chief worker had ceased from her labours. That <lb/>
work, commenced in faith and love, having only one <lb/>
<pb n="202" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0209"/>
object&mdash;the glory of God in the elevation of the poor <lb/>
benighted and lost children of Syria&mdash;will go on <reg orig="in-|creasing">increasing</reg> <lb/>
and widening, until the superstition by <lb/>
which the Syrians are enchained shall be destroyed, <lb/>
and a true and pure worship shall resound from the <lb/>
homes and hearts of the almost sacred Lebanon.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Hood</hi>, in his immortal "Song of the Shirt," <lb/>
brought before the world the horrors of <lb/>
shirt-making; the poet, however, had he <lb/>
made the inquiry, would have found other <lb/>
employments the details of which would have been <lb/>
equally harrowing. What would he have said on <lb/>
being taken to the top of a narrow staircase in one <lb/>
of the most wretched London lanes, and shown a <lb/>
number of pale-faced, worn, and hunger-pinched <lb/>
children, engaged in making match-boxes? &mdash; the <lb/>
price paid by the woman who owned the room and <lb/>
employed the children being three farthings for <reg orig="mak-|ing">making</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="204" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0211"/>
a gross of boxes! She, however, received <reg orig="two-|pence">twopence</reg> <lb/>
halfpenny per gross, &mdash; her part being to <lb/>
superintend the children, to see that the work was <lb/>
done well, and to find paste and firing to dry the <lb/>
boxes. The little workers as they completed their <lb/>
tasks received not farthings, but the value of the <lb/>
earned farthings in slices of bread, cut from a loaf <lb/>
which stood upon the table. It requires little effort <lb/>
of the imagination to realize the misery of the <lb/>
children thus employed. Morning to night, with <lb/>
scarce a pause, working for a piece of bread which <lb/>
did little more than keep away the extreme sense of <lb/>
hunger! No wonder that hundreds of these children <lb/>
die annually&mdash;die of want of the common <reg orig="neces-|saries">necessaries</reg> <lb/>
of existence; their little earnings too <reg orig="fre-|quently">frequently</reg> <lb/>
ministering to the vices of a thriftless mother <lb/>
or an idle and dissipated father. Many of the <reg orig="chil-|dren">children</reg> <lb/>
thus employed are mere infants, scarce out of <lb/>
their mother's arms, and almost unable to sit alone. <lb/>
A little practice enables these wee things to make <lb/>
themselves useful by putting sand-paper on the <lb/>
boxes; and then, as practice makes perfect, in a little <lb/>
time they are promoted to the more important work of <lb/>
box-making. The swiftest box-makers are children <lb/>
ranging from eight to ten years of age. A very <lb/>
expert girl can make four shillings and twopence <lb/>
weekly; but she must be assisted by her mother and <lb/>
the other children in cutting the paper, folding, <lb/>
making cases, sanding, drying, counting, and tying the <lb/>
<pb n="205" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0212"/>
boxes in parcels. This seems very much like a <lb/>
whole family earning only four and twopence per <lb/>
week.</p>
<p>A clergyman in reporting upon the condition of <lb/>
the little match-box makers said: "The other day I <lb/>
took upon my knees a little girl who is employed in <lb/>
this manner. She told me she was four years old. <lb/>
Her mother said the child had earned her own living <lb/>
ever since she was three years old. She makes <lb/>
several hundred boxes every day of her life and her <lb/>
earnings suffice to pay the rent of the miserable room <lb/>
which the family inhabits. The poor little <hi rend="italic">woman,</hi> <lb/>
as might be expected, is grave and sad beyond her <lb/>
years. She has none of a child's vivacity. She does <lb/>
not seem to know what play means; all her thoughts <lb/>
are centred in the eternal round of lucifer-box <reg orig="mak-|ing">making</reg>, <lb/>
in which her whole life is passed. She has <lb/>
never been beyond the dingy street in which she was <lb/>
born. She has never so much as seen a tree, or a <lb/>
daisy, or a blade of grass. A poor sickly little thing, <lb/>
and yet a sweet, obedient child, the deadly pallor of <lb/>
her face proclaiming unmistakably that she will soon <lb/>
be mercifully taken away to a better world, where <lb/>
at last the little weary fingers shall be at rest. And <lb/>
this is only one case out of scores and hundreds. <lb/>
The mortality among young children is something <lb/>
frightful. I do not know anything more terrible <lb/>
than the statements one continually hears. It is a <lb/>
common thing for a mother to say that she has <lb/>
<pb n="206" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0213"/>
buried six or eight, and reared one or two. This <lb/>
mortality among the children is chiefly owing to the <lb/>
deadly overcrowding, and insufficiency of food and <lb/>
clothing. Last summer we found a family of eight <lb/>
children living with their father and mother in a <lb/>
room some ten feet square, and almost in a state of <lb/>
starvation. The whole of the children had the <lb/>
small-pox out upon them. They had no medical <lb/>
care or nursing: the only medicament that had been <lb/>
used was a little oil rubbed over their faces; this the <lb/>
father said he had heard was good for the small-pox! <lb/>
The man was engaged, meanwhile, in the delicate <lb/>
work of making white chenille, to be found in the <lb/>
fashionable West End shops!</p>
<p>"Hardly a family in the parish possesses more <lb/>
than a single room, in which all the members live, <lb/>
and work, and sleep. For this one room from three <lb/>
shillings to four shillings weekly is paid out of the <lb/>
scanty earnings, leaving a sum quite insufficient to <lb/>
provide the merest necessary food. Last week my <lb/>
colleague went into a room where the father lay <lb/>
seriously ill, and asked the wife some question about <lb/>
the nourishment she was giving him. 'I will show <lb/>
you, sir, what we have,' was the reply. She opened <lb/>
a cupboard door. One slice of dry bread lay <reg orig="care-|fully">carefully</reg> <lb/>
treasured on the shelf: this was all that was <lb/>
left for the support of the sick man and the whole <lb/>
family, and not a halfpenny did they possess <reg orig="where-|with">wherewith</reg> <lb/>
to procure more. I believe I am under the <lb/>
<pb n="207" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0214"/>
mark when I affirm that not one in twenty has a <lb/>
blanket of their own, and not one in twelve has a <lb/>
sheet."</p>
<p>It was personal knowledge that this and other <lb/>
sad stories were true that induced Miss Annie <reg orig="Mac-|pherson">Macpherson</reg> <lb/>
to resolve to devote herself to the work <lb/>
of raising some of these poor children from their <lb/>
most pitiable condition. One result of the <reg orig="clergy-|man's">clergyman's</reg> <lb/>
touching story was to induce some benevolent <lb/>
persons to send money to the office of the <hi rend="italic">Revival</hi>, <lb/>
with a wish that it might be devoted to furnishing a <lb/>
tea-meeting for "the poor children of Bethnal Green, <lb/>
who toil to get their living, and die <hi rend="italic">old</hi> at an early <lb/>
age." The proposal of a tea-meeting was a very <lb/>
happy one. It promised to find the poor children <lb/>
with plenty of food for one night, and that which <lb/>
was seldom given to them&mdash;a little healthy <reg orig="enjoy-|ment">enjoyment</reg>. <lb/>
The tea-meeting was held in Bedford Hall. <lb/>
Upwards of three hundred children sat at the tables, <lb/>
and were waited upon by friends and several <reg orig="Bible-|women">Bible-women</reg>, <lb/>
who had been chiefly instrumental in <reg orig="draw-|ing">drawing</reg> <lb/>
them together. Their parents felt much moved <lb/>
by the kindness shown to their little ones. The <lb/>
children were in ecstasies. To many it was the first <lb/>
evening of real enjoyment they had ever experienced. <lb/>
The little people could not all sit down to tea at the <lb/>
same time. Many had tasks to complete which had <lb/>
been given them late in the day; others had to leave <lb/>
before the proceedings had closed in order to <reg orig="com-|mence">commence</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="208" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0215"/>
work again, and to work through part of the <lb/>
night. After tea an exhibition of dissolving views <lb/>
mightily interested the children. Several addresses <lb/>
were given in the spirit of the Master. Miss <reg orig="Mac-|pherson's">Macpherson's</reg> <lb/>
sister rendered excellent service by raising <lb/>
at intervals a sweet song of praise in which the <lb/>
children could join. Many, if not most, of the <reg orig="chil-|dren">children</reg> <lb/>
had had the advantage of attending a Sunday <lb/>
school. Had it not been for the blessed Sabbath and <lb/>
for Sunday schools, the little ones would have had <lb/>
no moment to learn of "Canaan, bright Canaan," of <lb/>
"Jesus, who lives above the sky," and of the <lb/>
"Happy land, far far away." The ages of the little <lb/>
workers were from six to fourteen; some were <lb/>
younger&mdash;one or two not four years old! One of <lb/>
them, whose baby hand rested confidingly within the <lb/>
hand of a friend, had that morning been busy <reg orig="earn-|ing">earning</reg> <lb/>
bread; and an infant that had become <reg orig="over-|whelmed">overwhelmed</reg> <lb/>
with sleep, which all the noisy delight of <lb/>
the elder ones could not disturb, could, as its mother <lb/>
said, "make boxes against any one." Another little <lb/>
child of six had a broken spine, and was compelled <lb/>
to kneel to his work of putting sand-paper on the <lb/>
boxes. His little sister said they often cried to see <lb/>
him then, and afterwards when in bed, resting on his <lb/>
knees. This little fellow had learned to pray to his <lb/>
heavenly Father, and to know something of that <lb/>
home where pain and sorrow are not known.</p>
<p>Many of the scenes in the homes of the workers <lb/>
<pb n="209" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0216"/>
were heart-rending. In one of the narrow alleys a <lb/>
pale child, with tangled hair, might be observed <lb/>
working at box-making, the mother, with a <reg orig="con-|sumptive">consumptive</reg> <lb/>
child upon her lap, assisting in pasting the <lb/>
paper. Another poor creature had got near the end <lb/>
of her earthly pilgrimage. She lay upon her <reg orig="death-|bed">deathbed</reg> <lb/>
watching her three little ones making boxes, and <lb/>
thus earning a little food for themselves and their <lb/>
dear sick mother. The bed in which she lay was <lb/>
their only bed&mdash;soon, very soon, she would be carried <lb/>
from it to a still narrower bed, and the children left <lb/>
to the mercies of a cold and almost a regardless <lb/>
world. But it was not the box-makers only who <lb/>
were oppressed. One boy, on being questioned, <lb/>
stated that he worked at silk trimmings from eight <lb/>
in the morning until ten at night! It is not an <reg orig="un-|usual">unusual</reg> <lb/>
thing for children to go errands to the shops <lb/>
in Bethnal Green after ten at night, and excuse <lb/>
themselves that they have only just left work! If <lb/>
an order is given out late in the day, a good part of <lb/>
the night must be devoted to its completion. Sleep <lb/>
and weariness must all give way; food must be had, <lb/>
and food can only be obtained by continuous and <lb/>
exhaustive work. And yet, to their infinite credit, <lb/>
many of these children manifest surprising eagerness <lb/>
to learn to read. One boy of eleven, whose father <lb/>
had died of cholera, and who is compelled to work <lb/>
twelve hours a day at paper-ruling, makes every <lb/>
effort to attend school in the evening.</p>
<pb n="210" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0217"/>
<p>The first tea-meeting had been so successful that <lb/>
it was resolved to hold another to which the young <lb/>
box-makers were again to be invited. One of the <lb/>
friends present at this meeting wrote a description <lb/>
and an account of the proceedings:&mdash;"Love seems <lb/>
the keystone of the happy tea-meetings to these <lb/>
children, of which another was held at George Yard <lb/>
Ragged School last week. Who sends the means? <lb/>
The lovers of Jesus. Who finds, in cellars and <lb/>
garrets, the little overworked guests? The loving <lb/>
helpers connected with George Yard and the Gospel <lb/>
Hall. Who prepares the feast? A little motley <lb/>
group of lowly, loving disciples. Who contributes to <lb/>
the healthful entertainment of a portion of the <reg orig="even-|ing">evening</reg>? <lb/>
A hearty, honest young tradesman living in <lb/>
their midst. Who speaks to them of Jesus? Those <lb/>
prompted with love to precious souls. Who shall <lb/>
gather out jewels for his own crown in the great <reg orig="in-|gathering">in-gathering</reg> <lb/>
day from among those pale-faced little <lb/>
ones? The loving Saviour who said when on earth, <lb/>
'Suffer little children to come unto Me.' Dear wee <lb/>
lambs! many a hard rub had their faces received to <lb/>
make them look bright. Their shining eyes were <lb/>
brilliant with joy. But beyond this, soiled and <lb/>
ragged was their general appearance, and no wonder.</p>
<p>"We began at five. No laggards had to be waited <lb/>
for. All were soon seated, and it was most touching <lb/>
to see the tenderness of elder brothers and sisters <lb/>
over the younger ones. Several seemed so young as <lb/>
<pb n="211" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0218"/>
to lead one to doubt their coming under the name of <lb/>
workers. On asking a little fellow what he did&mdash; <lb/>
'I puts san'-paper on the boxes.' Asking his age, <lb/>
his sister said he was three years and a half old.</p>
<p>"One dear boy, during the middle of the tea, called <lb/>
me to him, saying, 'Would you be angry if I take <lb/>
this piece of bread and butter to my baby?' By the <lb/>
time a piece of paper was procured to wrap it in, the <lb/>
lump of cake had been distributed to each; then a <lb/>
host of hands were up for paper to carry it home to <lb/>
'my mother,' or 'my baby.' They were then enjoined <lb/>
to eat it, for another piece would be given them to <lb/>
carry home on leaving. After tea, on being asked <lb/>
which were their favourite hymns, with one voice <lb/>
they called out, 'Please, may we sing "I want to be <lb/>
an angel"?' Then it was, 'Jesus, who lives above <lb/>
the sky.' There seemed much melody among these <lb/>
poor young hearts. After the hymn, they greatly <lb/>
enjoyed having the large diagrams explained to them <lb/>
illustrating the 'Pilgrim's Progress.' From one group <lb/>
of girls especially the answers to questions were most <lb/>
touching, showing that the Spirit of God was <reg orig="work-|ing">working</reg> <lb/>
on their young hearts; and on inquiring further <lb/>
about them, Mr. Holland, the superintendent, rejoiced <lb/>
us by an account of their little meetings for prayer <lb/>
among themselves, and the decision many of them <lb/>
had made 'to love Jesus.'</p>
<p>"After another sweet hymn, several experiments <lb/>
of an instructive and interesting kind were given, <lb/>
<pb n="212" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0219"/>
affording much pleasure. Some simple and pointed <lb/>
addresses were then delivered, and the hymn 'Around <lb/>
the throne of God in heaven' was heartily sung by <lb/>
the children. All were then earnestly commended <lb/>
to the care of the heavenly Father.</p>
<p>"Two or three interesting cases were discovered <lb/>
at this meeting. One boy, homeless and friendless, <lb/>
had had no food for two days. Another boy had <lb/>
been a year under the direction of a Sunday-school <lb/>
superintendent. He is an orphan, or at least his <lb/>
father had long forsaken him. He wanted to learn <lb/>
a trade."</p>
<p>Parcels of old clothes, Testaments and other books, <lb/>
shoes, boxes of dolls, toys, and other articles, were <lb/>
sent, to be distributed among the children; and most <lb/>
useful and welcome were such presents.</p>
<p>In addition to the children's tea-parties, tea-<reg orig="meet-|ings">meetings</reg> <lb/>
were held for the mothers, who paid twopence <lb/>
each for the entertainment. After tea, homely <reg orig="con-|versational">conversational</reg> <lb/>
lessons were given on such subjects as, <lb/>
"The uses and abuses of a towel;" "The advantages <lb/>
of having a table-cloth;" "The pleasures connected <lb/>
with an all-over wash;" "How to make home cozy, <lb/>
the guidman contented, and the bairns happy." At <lb/>
the end of the meetings towels, table-cloths, and <lb/>
other things, were sold at half-cost, as an <reg orig="encourage-|ment">encouragement</reg> <lb/>
to use them. Many of these poor women could <lb/>
not read, and yet refused to humble themselves to be <lb/>
taught. Miss Macpherson, however, formed a <reg orig="listen-|ing">listening</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="213" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0220"/>
class, a learning class, and a reading class. Nearly <lb/>
one hundred women responded to the invitation to <lb/>
attend the classes, from three to five on the Sunday <lb/>
afternoons. On the Sunday evenings classes were <lb/>
formed to teach the children to read, and to inculcate <lb/>
such moral precepts as their little minds could grasp. <lb/>
Their temporal wants were not, however, uncared for. <lb/>
The little people required food, clothes for their <lb/>
starved backs, and shoes for their bare feet. A plea <lb/>
was made to the public for one thousand pairs of <lb/>
shoes; and, as Miss Macpherson believes, in answer <lb/>
to her prayers, money was freely sent to her to <reg orig="pur-|chase">purchase</reg> <lb/>
hundred after hundred of pairs of shoes. <lb/>
Stockings knitted by loving hands, great quantities <lb/>
of garments, and money to purchase bread and soup, <lb/>
four or five times a week, to feed five hundred people, <lb/>
were also freely provided by good, kind, and <reg orig="large-|hearted">largehearted</reg> <lb/>
Christians.</p>
<p>The need of material help was shown in the report <lb/>
of one of the self-denying ladies, who found joy and <lb/>
happiness in following the precepts of her divine <lb/>
Master. She reports that in a court leading out of <lb/>
Brick Lane, Spitalfields, she found a poor sick woman <lb/>
and two little girls. The girls were up at their work <lb/>
of making match-boxes at six in the morning, and <lb/>
had to toil through a long day to earn bread for <lb/>
themselves and their sick mother. The father had <lb/>
died of cholera, and the machine had superseded the <lb/>
poor woman's labours at shoe-binding. Sorrow and <lb/>
<pb n="214" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0221"/>
want had thus brought her very low. The gift of a <lb/>
blanket, therefore, was a real boon. One of the <reg orig="chil-|dren">children</reg> <lb/>
was asked, "What becomes of you at night?" <lb/>
as there was only one small bed in the room. The <lb/>
answer was, "Mother takes off her petticoat, and <lb/>
tucks us up, and she sleeps on a chair." Very often <lb/>
they have only one meal a day. In another room in <lb/>
another house a poor girl was found tossing upon a <lb/>
narrow bed, calling pitifully for her boxes. Her <lb/>
poor widowed mother was by her side, trying to <lb/>
soothe her. Nellie, the other sister, was a lunatic at <lb/>
Colney Hatch&mdash;"all through the <hi rend="italic">boxes</hi>," the <reg orig="neigh-|bours">neighbours</reg> <lb/>
said. The sisters <hi rend="italic">would</hi> work so long&mdash;often <lb/>
until three o'clock in the morning&mdash;in order to keep <lb/>
themselves a little decent. The mother was enabled, <lb/>
by earning a few pence at the widows' sewing <reg orig="meet-|ing">meeting</reg>, <lb/>
to struggle through the winter without selling <lb/>
the bits of furniture,&mdash;an old bedstead, two broken <lb/>
chairs, and a small table. Some of the poor <reg orig="match-|box">matchbox</reg> <lb/>
makers were so much reduced that the only <lb/>
article of furniture remaining was the table upon <lb/>
which the boxes were made. This was the case with <lb/>
one family, the four children sleeping on the bare <lb/>
floor. The mother, however, had the additional <lb/>
luxury of a small pillow upon which to rest her head <lb/>
during the night.</p>
<p>The money to relieve these sad instances of poverty <lb/>
was not more welcome than the spirit in which it <lb/>
was contributed. A noble-hearted lad sent <reg orig="twenty-|nine">twenty-nine</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="215" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0222"/>
shillings to provide soup for the children. The <lb/>
money had been collected amongst his little friends. <lb/>
By denying himself sugar, he had been enabled to <lb/>
save thirty pence. He was accustomed to go round <lb/>
the neighbourhood with a little box, soliciting <reg orig="sub-|scriptions">subscriptions</reg>. <lb/>
When a penny was given him his face <lb/>
would light up with joy. One little girl, only five <lb/>
years of age, wrote: "I send you some money for <lb/>
the little match-box makers, to buy some boots. <lb/>
Part of it is my sugar-money, and part is from my <lb/>
purse, and the rest I have got from mother. I hope <lb/>
to send more some day. I am making a chemise for <lb/>
a little girl.&mdash;From your little friend Ceci." Another <lb/>
girl wrote: "I am a little girl of twelve years old. <lb/>
My mother is dead, and I am living with my uncle <lb/>
and aunt; and I read in the <hi rend="italic">Revival</hi> about the poor <lb/>
starving children, and the Lord put it into my heart <lb/>
to send you what he gave me. It was seven shillings <lb/>
and sixpence. I want to know if you got it safe. <lb/>
Pray for me. God bless you." One lady wrote: <lb/>
"Dear Miss Macpherson,&mdash;My little boy has been <lb/>
very much interested in the accounts of the teas to <lb/>
the little match-box makers, and has been some time <lb/>
past saving his pence, which now amount to ten <reg orig="shil-|lings">shillings</reg>, <lb/>
which he wishes you to kindly devote to the <lb/>
poor little things, as you think well. He was always <lb/>
accustomed to have a night-light in his room, which <lb/>
I wished him to give up, but he was not inclined; <lb/>
but when his interest was aroused in your work, he <lb/>
<pb n="216" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0223"/>
proposed that the price of the lights, one penny per <lb/>
night, should be put by for the purpose." Many <lb/>
other letters were received from mothers and <reg orig="chil-|dren">children</reg>, <lb/>
conveying material aid, and breathing prayers <lb/>
and blessings for the poor little match-box makers.</p>
<p>In order permanently to benefit the poor children, <lb/>
Miss Macpherson established several night-schools, so <lb/>
that the girls might learn to sew and knit. They were <lb/>
taught to read in the Sunday afternoon and evening <lb/>
schools. On the first Tuesday in every month a <lb/>
social tea and Band of Hope meeting was held. Many <lb/>
of the children were thus fitted to commence other <lb/>
and more remunerative employments. Seldom a day <lb/>
passed but Miss Macpherson had the pleasure to <lb/>
equip and send away some girl to become a domestic <lb/>
servant. To hear of the success of these girls must <lb/>
be a sweet reward for the labour undertaken on their <lb/>
account. No small amount of anxiety would be <reg orig="in-|curred">incurred</reg> <lb/>
before the Girls' Mission Home, the Girls' <lb/>
Industrial Society, and the Clothing and Shoe Club <lb/>
were brought into full operation. But when the <lb/>
spirit is rightly attuned, when work is undertaken in <lb/>
the eye of the Master, holy joy is awarded to the <lb/>
labourer in his work; then "to visit the fatherless <lb/>
and the widow" yields more solid satisfaction than <lb/>
any mere enjoyment offered by the world. Miss <lb/>
Macpherson, no doubt, had many trials ere she <reg orig="suc-|ceeded">succeeded</reg>, <lb/>
to any considerable extent, in her <reg orig="philan-|thropic">philanthropic</reg> <lb/>
efforts. Perseverance and an entire <reg orig="depend-|ence">dependence</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="217" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0224"/>
upon God's providence enabled her to surmount <lb/>
all difficulties, to rise above all trials, and finally to reap <lb/>
a blessed reward in seeing the fruit of her labours.</p>

<p>Dorothy Wyndlow Pattison, whose father, the <lb/>
Rev. Mark James Pattison, was the rector of <reg orig="Haux-|well">Hauxwell</reg>, <lb/>
a little village near Richmond, was born on the <lb/>
16th day of January 1832. She is described as <lb/>
having been a very lovely child, but exceedingly <lb/>
delicate, and subject to many infantile diseases; <lb/>
through which she happily lived, owing to the care <lb/>
of her sisters, by whom she was much loved. <reg orig="For-|tunately">Fortunately</reg>, <lb/>
her strength increased with her years, so <lb/>
that she became a fine, strong, healthy girl, fond of <lb/>
fun, drawing amusement and interest from every <lb/>
source, and cheerfully catering for the pleasure of <lb/>
those about her. Her first passion was for music <lb/>
and riding, in which she made great proficiency. In <lb/>
after life, her sweet voice, which had so often <reg orig="glad-|dened">gladdened</reg> <lb/>
her father's home in her early years, soothed <lb/>
and stilled many a weary head in the hospital <reg orig="dormi-|tories">dormitories</reg>; <lb/>
and many a maimed and suffering lad has <lb/>
been eased of his pains by Sister Dora's tales of wild <lb/>
runs across the moors, and exciting accounts of <reg orig="glo-|rious">glorious</reg> <lb/>
hunting days. Her father called her, as she <lb/>
<pb n="220" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0227"/>
went singing about the house, "Sunshine;" a name <lb/>
well deserved by the little girl, who brought pleasure <lb/>
by her presence. An incident is related of her <lb/>
early years, While travelling, "a schoolboy in the <lb/>
village, who was specially attached to her, fell ill of <lb/>
rheumatic fever. The boy's one longing was to see <lb/>
'Miss Dora' again; and as he grew worse and worse, <lb/>
and still she did not come home, he constantly prayed <lb/>
that he might live to see her. On the day on which <lb/>
she was expected, he sat up on his pillows intently <lb/>
listening; and at last, long before any one else could <lb/>
hear a sound of wheels, he exclaimed, 'There she <lb/>
is! there's Miss Dora!' and sunk back." Dora went <lb/>
to the poor lad, rendering him all kindly offices, until <lb/>
he died.</p>
<p>But she was not only "Sunshine" to her young <lb/>
schoolfellow, but all who knew her remembered her <lb/>
glad and laughing spirits. "Her merry laugh still <lb/>
rings in my ears," writes one of the neighbours. <lb/>
Another said, "I have known nothing of Dora for <lb/>
many years, but always think of her as the bright, <lb/>
bonnie maiden, singing about the house." No doubt <lb/>
she owed much of the physical vigour of her <reg orig="subse-|quent">subsequent</reg> <lb/>
life to the amusements of her early years. <lb/>
No boy exhibited greater zest or interest in outdoor <lb/>
games. She could run and jump, follow the fox or <lb/>
hare, or join in a rat-hunt with all the enthusiasm of <lb/>
a healthy lad. Her faults&mdash;for she had faults&mdash;were <lb/>
self-will and pride, and a resolute resolve to have her <lb/>
<pb n="221" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0228"/>
own way. In after-life, even these failings served <lb/>
her in enabling her to achieve many things which <lb/>
one less purposeless and resolved would have <reg orig="de-|spaired">despaired</reg> <lb/>
of achieving. They were failings, <reg orig="neverthe-|less">nevertheless</reg>, <lb/>
and were in the course of her life the source of <lb/>
much disquiet to Dora.</p>
<p>From her twentieth to her twenty-ninth year Dora <lb/>
at home was dissatisfied with the comparative <reg orig="monot-|onous">monotonous</reg> <lb/>
life she led. At this time she had become a <lb/>
finely developed, handsome woman, with strong <lb/>
yearnings for work. When the news of Miss <reg orig="Night-|ingale's">Nightingale's</reg> <lb/>
labours in the Crimea reached her, she <lb/>
bounded in spirit at the thought of joining the band <lb/>
of nurses. But the consent of her father could not <lb/>
be obtained, and the thought of work in the Crimean <lb/>
hospitals had to be relinquished. There was work <lb/>
at home, so her father said, if she would only think <lb/>
so, sufficient to employ all her powers. This work, <lb/>
despite a longing for a more extended field of labour, <lb/>
was not neglected. Dora's mother was a great <reg orig="in-|valid">invalid</reg>, <lb/>
and required great care and nursing. This <lb/>
duty Dora cheerfully and lovingly divided with her <lb/>
sister until her mother died; which event was very <lb/>
sudden. Then Dora, in the exercise of her self-will, <lb/>
and in opposition to her father's desires, resolved <lb/>
upon obtaining some employment from home. She <lb/>
made the acquaintance of "the Sisters of the Good <lb/>
Samaritans," who have cottage hospitals in various <lb/>
places. To join these sisters, and to work with them <lb/>
<pb n="222" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0229"/>
in their humane labours, seemed to Dora the <reg orig="realiza-|tion">realization</reg> <lb/>
of her utmost desire. Her father strongly <reg orig="ob-|jected">objected</reg> <lb/>
to the religious opinions of the sisters, and did <lb/>
all he could short of absolutely forbidding her to join <lb/>
them. Dora, however, in the exercise of her <reg orig="deter-|mined">determined</reg> <lb/>
self-will, would not be controlled. She lived <lb/>
to repent her disobedience; and when upon her <reg orig="death-|bed">deathbed</reg> <lb/>
she said: "I was very wilful; I did very wrong. <lb/>
Let no one take me for an example."</p>
<p>Her first employment after leaving home was as <lb/>
schoolmistress in the village of Little Woolston, in <lb/>
Buckinghamshire. She conducted the school for <lb/>
three years admirably, when an attack of pleurisy <lb/>
compelled her to return to Redcar, the head-quarters <lb/>
of the Sisters of the Good Samaritans, when she joined <lb/>
the association, going into the Home at Coatham, and <lb/>
thenceforth being known as "Sister Dora." In the <lb/>
Home she was subjected to a severe discipline, which <lb/>
no doubt she had not contemplated. "She made <lb/>
beds, cleaned and scoured floors and grates, swept <lb/>
and dusted, and finally became a cook in the kitchen." <lb/>
She was at length relieved from this drudgery by <lb/>
being sent to a small cottage hospital at North <lb/>
Ormesby, near Middlesborough. Early in 1865 she <lb/>
was sent to a cottage hospital in Walsall, near <reg orig="Bir-|mingham">Birmingham</reg>. <lb/>
As accidents were very frequent in the <lb/>
district, and as it was inconvenient to send cases <lb/>
requiring immediate attention to Birmingham, an <lb/>
accident hospital was opened by the Sisters of the <lb/>
<pb n="223" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0230"/>
Good Samaritans. Sister Mary, who had the first <lb/>
charge of the hospital, and who had nobly done her <lb/>
duty in establishing the hospital, fell ill, and had to <lb/>
be removed to Bournemouth. Dora had to take her <lb/>
place, and as the immediate result caught the <reg orig="small-|pox">smallpox</reg> <lb/>
from one of the out-patients; from which, after <lb/>
much suffering, she recovered.</p>
<p>At the outset the little hospital was not free from <lb/>
opposition. The sisters were not unfrequently <reg orig="in-|sulted">insulted</reg> <lb/>
and jostled in the streets of the town. Upon <lb/>
one occasion, as Dora was walking rather late in the <lb/>
evening to visit a patient, a boy shouted, "There <lb/>
goes one of those Sisters of Misery!" at the same time <lb/>
throwing a stone which cut open her forehead. Some <lb/>
time after, an accident having occurred in one of the <lb/>
coal pits, this lad, whom Dora had not failed to <reg orig="ob-|serve">observe</reg>, <lb/>
was brought in among the wounded to the <lb/>
hospital. Dora immediately noted the lad, saying to <lb/>
herself, "That's my man!" and busied herself for his <lb/>
relief and comfort. "One night when he was <reg orig="re-|covering">recovering</reg>, <lb/>
she found him quietly crying. 'I wouldn't <lb/>
ask him what was the matter, 'Dora said, when <reg orig="re-|lating">relating</reg> <lb/>
the story, 'because I knew well enough, and <lb/>
I wanted him to confess.' At length it came out <lb/>
with many sobs: 'Sister, <hi rend="italic">I</hi> threw that stone at you.' <lb/>
'Oh,' she replied, 'did you think I did not know <lb/>
that? Why, I knew you the very first minute you <lb/>
came in at the door.' 'What!' returned he; 'you <lb/>
knew me, and have been nursing me like this?' <lb/>
<pb n="224" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0231"/>
'You see,' added Sister Dora, 'it was his first <reg orig="prac-|tical">practical</reg> <lb/>
experience of good returned for evil, and he <lb/>
didn't know what to make of it.'"</p>
<p>The field-sports and open-air exercises of her <lb/>
earlier years no doubt fitted her to undergo a <reg orig="pecu-|liar">peculiar</reg> <lb/>
trial. The celebrated Sir James Simpson of <lb/>
Edinburgh had visited the Home to select a nurse <lb/>
to look after an old lady who was nearly insane. <lb/>
Although Dora, at the time of Sir James's visit, had <lb/>
her sleeves tucked up and was making a pudding, <lb/>
his selection immediately fell upon her. "Send me <lb/>
that sister; she is the one for my case." One night <lb/>
as she sat up with the old lady, who seemed to be <lb/>
asleep, Dora sat at the window calmly enjoying the <lb/>
peaceful night. Suddenly and noiselessly the old <lb/>
woman sprung out of bed, and seizing Dora by the <lb/>
shoulder, brandished a long knife over her head! Dora, <lb/>
perfectly unmoved, without uttering a word, looked <lb/>
calmly at her. "I wanted to see if I could frighten <lb/>
you," said the poor half-mad woman. From that <lb/>
time, however, she made no similar attempt.</p>
<p>In 1865 Dora was sent back to Walsall, when she <lb/>
became, what the Walsall people always afterwards <lb/>
called her, "<hi rend="italic">our</hi> sister." A proposal was afterwards <lb/>
made that she should be removed to Middlesborough; <lb/>
but the committee and medical men connected with <lb/>
the hospital, who had become aware of her fitness <lb/>
for the work of caring for the sick, strongly <reg orig="remon-|strated">remonstrated</reg> <lb/>
against her removal, and happily succeeded <lb/>
<pb n="225" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0232"/>
in detaining Dora. In the December of the same <lb/>
year she was ordered to go to Devonshire to attend <lb/>
upon a private patient. The committee desired that <lb/>
some other nurse should be sent, and that Dora <lb/>
should be allowed to remain at Walsall. Before an <lb/>
answer was received in reply, a letter came from her <lb/>
home telling her that her father was dangerously ill, <lb/>
and that he desired to see her at once. She <reg orig="tele-|graphed">telegraphed</reg> <lb/>
to the Home at Coatham the condition of <lb/>
her father and his earnest desire to see her, asking that <lb/>
another nurse might be sent to the private patient, <lb/>
so that she might be permitted to go to her father <lb/>
immediately. It seems beyond belief that so strange <lb/>
and unnatural an answer should have been returned: <lb/>
"No; you must go at once to Devonshire." How <lb/>
gladly would we write that Dora despised the cruel <lb/>
order, and that she at once started for her home at <lb/>
Hauxwell; but no, &mdash; she obeyed her self-chosen <lb/>
masters and proceeded to Devonshire! Scarcely had <lb/>
she arrived when the news reached her that her <lb/>
father was dead. Then the inhuman sisterhood <lb/>
granted her a tardy permission to attend the funeral. <lb/>
To this Dora replied, that as permission was not <lb/>
given her to see her father when alive, she did not <lb/>
care to go now that he was dead. The thoughts and <lb/>
feelings of the superior of the sisterhood when <reg orig="con-|templating">contemplating</reg> <lb/>
her conduct are not to be envied. It had <lb/>
the effect at once of opening a breach in the regards <lb/>
which Dora entertained for the Order of the Good <lb/>
<pb n="226" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0233"/>
Samaritans, which was never healed. In time the <lb/>
yoke which must have galled years of Dora's life was <lb/>
thrown off.</p>
<p>To lighten the great trial to which she had been <lb/>
so unfeelingly subjected, Dora devoted herself, with <lb/>
all the energy of her active nature, to her duties. <lb/>
She resolved thoroughly to understand what would <lb/>
enable her to be a reliable surgical nurse, and shortly <lb/>
attained great coolness and proficiency in dressing <lb/>
wounds and attending to the many maimed patients <lb/>
brought into the little hospital. Ultimately Dora, by <lb/>
study and patient observation, attained to <reg orig="extraor-|dinary">extraordinary</reg> <lb/>
surgical excellence. There were not wanting <lb/>
friends who would have had her relinquish what <lb/>
seemed to them painful and unwomanly duties; but <lb/>
Dora, feeling that her future happiness must consist <lb/>
in work, firmly resolved to devote herself to the <lb/>
good of others. She did say, however, at the close <lb/>
of her life: "If I had to begin life over again, I <lb/>
would marry; because a woman ought to live with a <lb/>
man, and be in subjection."</p>
<p>When Dora had resolved to devote her life to <lb/>
duties imposed by herself, she depended upon her <lb/>
own strength; but presently she learned to lean upon <lb/>
her Saviour, who ever after became the source of all <lb/>
her comfort and the fountain of her heart's inward <lb/>
joy. She owed much of her spiritual strength to the <lb/>
companionship and teaching of the incumbent of the <lb/>
church of St. James, Wednesbury&mdash;the Rev. Richard <lb/>
<pb n="227" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0234"/>
Twigg&mdash;who, it was said after his death, had "buried <lb/>
talents which would have won the admiration of the <lb/>
world, in the smokiest dens of the Black Country." <lb/>
He not only praised and prompted Dora to good <lb/>
works, but kindly and firmly reproved faults which <lb/>
others only smoothed over.</p>
<p>The needs of the increasing town of Walsall <lb/>
demanded a larger and better-conditioned hospital; <lb/>
which was erected in a salubrious position, and of <lb/>
which Dora took entire charge. Here she had the <lb/>
fullest opportunity, not only of exercising the <reg orig="marvel-|lous">marvellous</reg> <lb/>
skill which she had acquired in setting broken <lb/>
limbs, in sewing and joining wounds, and performing <lb/>
other surgical operations, but of increasing her <reg orig="practi-|cal">practical</reg> <lb/>
knowledge by laborious study, which enabled her <lb/>
to become competent to take charge of the most <reg orig="diffi-|cult">difficult</reg> <lb/>
and dangerous cases. But this power, the result <lb/>
of painstaking acquirement, was aided and helped by <lb/>
a personal influence which wonderfully affected the <lb/>
sufferers in the hospital. Dora's beauty, and her <lb/>
gentle and high-bred sympathy, marvellously <reg orig="sub-|dued">subdued</reg> <lb/>
the rough natures of the colliers and <reg orig="iron-|workers">iron-workers</reg> <lb/>
who were under her care. Not unfrequently <lb/>
she could induce them to submit to operations which <lb/>
were not less dangerous than severely painful, when <lb/>
the entreaties of friends and relatives failed to obtain <lb/>
consent. Upon one occasion a poor fellow was told <lb/>
that the only means of saving his life was to <reg orig="ampu-|tate">amputate</reg> <lb/>
his leg. He had been carefully nursed for three <lb/>
<pb n="228" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0235"/>
months with the hope of saving the limb; but now <lb/>
hope was gone. Father and brother pleaded in vain; <lb/>
he would not consent to lose his leg. At length <lb/>
"sister came," and talked so cheerfully and <reg orig="per-|suasively">persuasively</reg>, <lb/>
that he "thought he could face it" if <lb/>
"sister" would be by. Next day the limb was taken <lb/>
off, and the man's life was saved. But Dora was <lb/>
more anxious to save limbs than to witness their <lb/>
destruction. She spared neither pains nor labour to <lb/>
accomplish this object. When upon one occasion a <lb/>
fine healthy young man was brought into the <reg orig="hos-|pital">hospital</reg>, <lb/>
with his arm torn and twisted by a machine, <lb/>
the doctor declared that nothing could save it, and <lb/>
that it must be taken off at once. The poor mangled <lb/>
fellow looked piteously at Dora, and cried, "O <lb/>
sister, save my arm for me! It's my right arm!" <lb/>
After looking carefully at the mangled arm, Dora <lb/>
turned to the surgeon, saying, "I believe I can save <lb/>
this arm, if you will let me try." "Are you mad?" <lb/>
was the reply. "I tell you it's <reg orig="impossible&mdash;mortifi-|cation">impossible&mdash;mortification</reg> <lb/>
will set in in a few hours. Nothing but <lb/>
amputation can save his life." Dora, turning to the <lb/>
poor fellow, said, "Are you willing for me to try <lb/>
and save your arm, my man?" The look which <lb/>
Dora gave him, and the feeling sympathy expressed <lb/>
in her voice, would have induced him to do anything. <lb/>
The surgeon then most unwillingly gave his consent, <lb/>
saying, as he did so, "He will die!" For three weeks <lb/>
Dora attended "her arm," as she called it, almost <lb/>
<pb n="229" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0236"/>
night and day. "How I prayed over that arm!" <lb/>
she said afterwards. But the arm was saved. Years <lb/>
afterwards, when Dora lay ill in the hospital, the <lb/>
grateful fellow whose arm had been preserved used <lb/>
to walk eleven miles into Walsall to ask how she <lb/>
was. "Tell sister <hi rend="italic">her</hi> arm pulled the bell!" and then <lb/>
he would tramp back again.</p>
<p>Dora's life in the hospital was no child's play. It <lb/>
was hard work both of head and hands. Dora, <reg orig="how-|ever">however</reg>, <lb/>
knew the secret of getting successfully through <lb/>
work and of subduing trouble. The secret, which <lb/>
ought to be no secret, was cheerfulness. Her bright, <lb/>
cheery spirit would flash out upon the poor fellows <lb/>
in their beds; and when Sister Dora gave them their <lb/>
breakfasts, after making their beds comfortable&mdash; <lb/>
which work was done at half-past six in the morning <lb/>
&mdash;the sleepless night, possibly, and the pains which <lb/>
had to be endured, would all be forgotten in her <lb/>
presence and charmed away by her pleasant and <lb/>
inspiriting words. It is no wonder that these big <lb/>
rough fellows learned to love Dora. They had never <lb/>
come in contact with a human being like her&mdash;"so <lb/>
beautiful, so good, so tender-hearted, so strong and <lb/>
so gentle, so full of fun and humour, and of <reg orig="sym-|pathy">sympathy</reg> <lb/>
for broken hearts as well as for every other <lb/>
kind of fracture, and the best friend that many of <lb/>
these poor maimed men had ever known." When <lb/>
the breakfast was over, Dora read prayers on the <lb/>
staircase lobby, so that the patients in all the wards <lb/>
<pb n="230" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0237"/>
could hear her. After prayers, Dora went round <lb/>
with the doctor and saw all the patients; and then, <lb/>
at twelve o'clock, carved the dinner, sending to each <lb/>
a portion of any little choice dish sent for her own <lb/>
use. At two o'clock the out-patients, from sixty to <lb/>
one hundred, had to be seen and spoken <reg orig="to,&mdash;know-|ing">to,&mdash;knowing</reg> <lb/>
all their names and having an interest in them <lb/>
all. The dressings and small operations were left <lb/>
to her care. After this labour came the patients' <lb/>
tea, which they would rather defer for hours than <lb/>
not receive it at her hands. At six o'clock the <lb/>
nurses sat down to their own meal with Dora, who <lb/>
was rarely permitted to end it before being called <lb/>
away, smilingly saying, as she went about the new <lb/>
duty, "There is no peace for the wicked."</p>
<p>The great charm of Dora's presence in the hospital <lb/>
was her cheerfulness. She told funny stories, read <lb/>
interesting books, had something fresh every day <lb/>
about the town or the out-patients to tell the sufferers <lb/>
on their beds. One big Irishman said, "She makes <lb/>
you laugh&mdash;yes, if you were dying." It was a part <lb/>
of Dora's hospital system to keep the patients <lb/>
interestingly engaged. She would lead and <reg orig="encour-|age">encourage</reg> <lb/>
a buzz of conversation in the wards, all the <lb/>
while busy with her own duties. At times, when <lb/>
her busy life would permit, which was very rare, <lb/>
she would sit down to a game of draughts or chess <lb/>
with one of the patients, whose delight at the honour <lb/>
may be imagined. Never in her presence, and seldom <lb/>
<pb n="231" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0238"/>
in her absence, would foul language be heard. "Stop <lb/>
that!" she said curtly when a man swore. "I must <lb/>
say something when the pain's so bad, sister." <lb/>
"Then say 'poker and tongs'&mdash;nothing else, <reg orig="re-|member">remember</reg>." <lb/>
All this was done so naturally, without <lb/>
the smallest affectation, that it had the happiest <lb/>
result. Upon those who believed that there is no <lb/>
God and no future&mdash;and such were at times brought <lb/>
into the hospital&mdash;Dora's sermon of daily life, her <lb/>
self-denial and cheerfulness, her willing performance <lb/>
of menial tasks, and her observant care of <reg orig="them-|selves">themselves</reg>, <lb/>
made a deep and lasting impression. Often <lb/>
in the dead of night would they awake to find her <lb/>
by their bedside praying that they might be <reg orig="en-|lightened">enlightened</reg> <lb/>
in their minds and hearts. No wonder <lb/>
that they came to a better mind, and acknowledged <lb/>
that there was something in the religion which they <lb/>
had despised and treated with contempt.</p>
<p>But it was not only in the hospital that Dora <lb/>
made her presence felt. There was no dark and <lb/>
black spot in the town, where sin and suffering had <lb/>
found a home, that was not visited by Dora. And <lb/>
when small-pox was in nearly all the homes of the <lb/>
poor people, every moment that she could spare from <lb/>
the hospital, without a thought of herself, she would <lb/>
spend in the infected streets and houses. Upon one <lb/>
occasion she entered a house where a man was dying <lb/>
of black pox in its worst form. All in fear and <lb/>
dread had left the poor fellow to die alone. The <lb/>
<pb n="232" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0239"/>
last morsel of candle expired as Dora sat by the <lb/>
bedside. As it did so, the man made one last effort <lb/>
to sit up, and said, "Sister, kiss me before I die." <lb/>
Dora instantly took the loathsome object in her arms <lb/>
and impressed a kiss upon him; then sitting through <lb/>
the long night in the darkness, she only discovered <lb/>
by the gray light of the morning that the man was <lb/>
dead! Dora, although singularly subject to <reg orig="con-|tagion">contagion</reg>, <lb/>
passed through this and a more severe <reg orig="sub-|sequent">subsequent</reg> <lb/>
small-pox visitation without injury.</p>
<p>But active and busy as Dora's life was, in the <lb/>
midst of so many grateful and loving hearts she <lb/>
was yet alone. She lacked, as she heartily desired, <lb/>
human sympathy, and that fellowship and equal <lb/>
intercourse which makes life a joy and happiness. <lb/>
She found, or thought she had found, all that her <lb/>
utmost desires needed in the society of a gentleman <lb/>
who learned to love her with his whole heart, and <lb/>
whose love she returned with all the fervour of her <lb/>
confiding nature. During the time of this <reg orig="inter-|course">intercourse</reg>, <lb/>
for it endured only for a time, Dora <reg orig="ex-|perienced">experienced</reg> <lb/>
unalloyed happiness, save in one respect&mdash; <lb/>
her lover disbelieved the truths of that religion <lb/>
which was Dora's inspiration and source of strength. <lb/>
It must have been a terrible struggle to give him <lb/>
up&mdash;the only being that had obtained her affections <lb/>
and undivided love. But Dora saw that otherwise <lb/>
she would imperil her spiritual happiness here and <lb/>
hereafter, and she resolved that the connection should <lb/>
<pb n="233" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0240"/>
cease. But this was not done without the most <lb/>
painful struggle, and a weary turning away from <lb/>
the idol set up in her heart to the duties of the <lb/>
hospital, in the hope that its cares would dissipate <lb/>
the remembrance of the life-trial through which she <lb/>
had passed. How much she was affected by the <lb/>
strain upon her affections was seen when one night <lb/>
she fainted upon one of the patients' beds. Dora's <lb/>
religion, however, was too sincere and heartfelt to <lb/>
allow her for one moment to doubt that she had <lb/>
adopted the right course. Life, for her, was religion; <lb/>
and religion was life. When a servant was about <lb/>
to be engaged for the hospital, Dora said, "Tell her <lb/>
this is not an ordinary house, or even hospital; I <lb/>
want her to understand that all who serve here, in <lb/>
whatever capacity, ought to have one rule, <hi rend="italic">love for <lb/>
God</hi>, and then I need not say love for their work. I <lb/>
wish we could use, and really mean, the word <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italic"><reg orig="Mai-|son-Dieu">Maison-Dieu</reg></hi></foreign>" <lb/>
&lpar;God's Hospital&rpar;.</p>
<p>The love which the patients who had been in the <lb/>
hospital had for her was pleasantly evidenced in the <lb/>
year 1871, when the servants of the South <reg orig="Stafford-|shire">Staffordshire</reg> <lb/>
Railway subscribed among themselves &pound;50, <lb/>
with which they bought a small carriage and pony <lb/>
to present to her. Dora thought at first that it <lb/>
would be almost useless owing to her want of time <lb/>
to employ it; but it was found useful in taking <lb/>
convalescents out for refreshing rides, and carrying <lb/>
Dora to the many sick and afflicted homes that she <lb/>
<pb n="234" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0241"/>
constantly visited. The thought naturally occurs, in <lb/>
learning of the many loving remembrances that were <lb/>
treasured by the patients who had been under Dora's <lb/>
care, that if more would convert their Christianity <lb/>
into active life, the reign of peace and love would <lb/>
not be so distant.</p>
<p>In 1875, for the third time, small-pox broke out <lb/>
in Walsall, spreading with terrible rapidity. An <reg orig="epi-|demic">epidemic</reg> <lb/>
hospital had been built, but the poor people <lb/>
had a strange objection to enter it. "They would <lb/>
far rather die at home. They were not afraid. Why <lb/>
could they not be let alone?" These answers, which <lb/>
were so general, threatened to make the hospital <lb/>
useless. Dora, however, came to the rescue. She <lb/>
offered to take charge of the hospital, and during her <lb/>
absence to delegate her own work to the charge of <lb/>
the lady nurses. The offer was gladly accepted, as <lb/>
it was well known that Sister Dora's name would <lb/>
overcome all scruples to enter the hospital. When <lb/>
the decision was known, the news was everywhere <lb/>
repeated, "Sister is going to the epidemic hospital." <lb/>
There was then no difficulty in getting patients. <lb/>
The work was commenced at once. The <reg orig="twenty-|eight">twenty-eight</reg> <lb/>
beds were soon filled with patients in every <lb/>
stage of the dreaded disease. She had little or no <lb/>
help. The porter was an old man, who, when sober, <lb/>
was kind and attentive, but who had frequent spells <lb/>
of drinking, which kept him out the whole night, <lb/>
leaving Dora alone with the dead and the dying. She <lb/>
<pb n="235" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0242"/>
had also the occasional help of two old women from <lb/>
the workhouse to assist her in washing the <reg orig="loath-|some">loathsome</reg> <lb/>
clothes and bedding. Her situation was not <lb/>
free from personal danger, independent of the danger <lb/>
of contagion. One night a big fellow, a collier, in <lb/>
his delirium, jumped out of bed and tried to make <lb/>
his escape. Dora, however, brought all her strength <lb/>
to bear upon him, forced him back upon his bed, and <lb/>
held him there till morning!</p>
<p>Dora was not quite forsaken in her lonely and <lb/>
loathsome home. The doctor, of course, visited the <lb/>
hospital regularly; and the secretary of the Cottage <lb/>
Hospital had learned to love Dora, to the extent, if <lb/>
needs be, of laying down his life for her. He brought <lb/>
her news of the patients in the hospital, fresh-cut <lb/>
flowers, books and papers that he thought would <lb/>
afford her a moment's interest. An old patient <lb/>
named Chell, an engine-stoker, was a constant visitor. <lb/>
When he was in the Cottage Hospital, Dora nursed <lb/>
him through a severe accident to his ankle; and <lb/>
then, owing to a railway accident, his leg had to be <lb/>
amputated. Chell said he did not remember <reg orig="any-|thing">anything</reg> <lb/>
about the operation, except,&mdash;"when I came <lb/>
to after the chloroform, Sister Dora was on her knees <lb/>
by my side, with her arm supporting my head, and <lb/>
she was repeating&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>'They climbed the steep ascent of heaven</l>
<l rend="indent">Through peril, toil, and pain;</l>
<l>O God, to us may grace be given</l>
<l rend="indent">To follow in their train.'"</l>
</lg></q>
<pb n="236" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0243"/>
The poor fellow never wearied of repeating these <lb/>
words, or remembering the tones of Sister Dora's <lb/>
voice. No wonder that he was a constant visitor <lb/>
at the small-pox hospital. Chell was one of the <lb/>
visitors permitted to visit the Cottage Hospital on <lb/>
Sundays, and to join in the hospital service. He said <lb/>
he could sing "till he was hoarse" with Sister Dora.</p>
<p>The strength that was given her of God&mdash;for Dora <lb/>
would acknowledge no other source of her capability <lb/>
to labour&mdash;enabled her to pass through the fearful <lb/>
trial without contracting the dreaded disease. Her <lb/>
strength and resolution were extraordinary. The <lb/>
doctor of the small-pox hospital said: "Sister Dora <lb/>
could sit up at night, and work all day, with little <lb/>
or no rest, and, as far as I am able to judge, she was <lb/>
neither physically nor mentally the worse for it. <lb/>
Her strength was superhuman. I never saw such a <lb/>
woman." After six long months the epidemic was <lb/>
subdued, and Dora returned to the Cottage Hospital <lb/>
and her loved work as quietly as she had left it.</p>
<p>On Friday, the 15th of October 1875, a fearful <lb/>
accident at one of the furnaces near Walsall <reg orig="oc-|curred">occurred</reg>. <lb/>
The hot metal, which burst out of the <reg orig="fur-|nace">furnace</reg>, <lb/>
flowed on to eleven poor fellows who were <lb/>
engaged at the mouth. When taken to the hospital <lb/>
they were more like charred logs than human <reg orig="be-|ings">beings</reg>. <lb/>
The cries of the poor sufferers were dreadful. <lb/>
Some lost all pain by losing consciousness in death. <lb/>
Dora might well have been distracted by the cries <lb/>
<pb n="237" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0244"/>
with which she was assailed:&mdash;"Sister, come and <lb/>
dress me!" "<hi rend="italic">Do</hi> dress me!" "Oh, you don't <lb/>
know how bad I am!" Dora gave them brandy, <lb/>
and rendered them all the assistance in her power; <lb/>
"but it was awful work." Both sight and smell <lb/>
were terrible. The medical men who hurried to <lb/>
render assistance were incessantly sick and could <lb/>
hardly stay in the ward. The scene was horrible; <lb/>
and yet Dora stayed and worked without a thought <lb/>
of herself. Only two of the poor fellows survived, <lb/>
notwithstanding all the care she unceasingly <reg orig="be-|stowed">bestowed</reg> <lb/>
upon them.</p>
<p>But Dora was not less resolute and courageous in <lb/>
efforts to cure the soul as well as the body. On the <lb/>
occasion of a mission in Walsall she induced two of <lb/>
the clergymen to hold a midnight service in a room <lb/>
in the worst part of the town. As they turned down <lb/>
a narrow court, Dora said, "Now keep close to me. <lb/>
I am safe enough; but <hi rend="italic">your</hi> lives are not worth a <lb/>
moment's purchase if you are seen down here <reg orig="with-|out">without</reg> <lb/>
me to protect you." Looking through one of <lb/>
the windows of a house, a number of women were <lb/>
seen sitting at a table, as if receiving orders from <lb/>
an ill-looking man. On knocking at the door, and <lb/>
answering the question "Who's there?" with "Sister <lb/>
Dora," a volley of oaths was heard, with the <reg orig="ques-|tion">question</reg>, <lb/>
"What do you mean by coming here at this <lb/>
time of night?" Dora merely answered, "Open the <lb/>
door; it's sister. I want to speak to you." When <lb/>
<pb n="238" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0245"/>
the door was opened, she addressed the man: "Why, <lb/>
Bill, what possesses you to treat me like this? Don't <lb/>
you remember what you told me the last time you <lb/>
came up to have that head seen to?" The only <lb/>
answer she received were growls and muttered oaths, <lb/>
and "be quick and say what she wanted." "I'll <lb/>
tell you what I want," Dora said, advancing into the <lb/>
room and taking each of the women by the hand, <lb/>
severally addressing them, "Well, Lizzie," or "Mary, <lb/>
how are you?" Then addressing them all, she said, <lb/>
"I want you all to go down on your knees with me <lb/>
now, this moment, and say a prayer to God." To <lb/>
the astonishment of the clergymen, the man and the <lb/>
women immediately knelt down, and Dora uttered <lb/>
a prayer from her inmost heart for her "brothers <lb/>
and sisters" who knelt with her. When the prayer <lb/>
was ended, the man said, "I'm very sorry, sister, I <lb/>
was so rude to you. I didn't mean it; you've been <lb/>
good to me." All were then persuaded to go into <lb/>
the little mission room to hear the addresses of <lb/>
the clergymen. Night after night, through Dora's <lb/>
influence, midnight meetings were held, attended by <lb/>
the worst men and women of the vilest parts of the <lb/>
town. When the mission week was ended, Dora <lb/>
still kept up midnight classes, in the hope of <reg orig="rescu-|ing">rescuing</reg> <lb/>
some of the poor women from their lives of <lb/>
shame. Dora then held classes for the cab-drivers, <lb/>
whose constant exposure to all weathers had excited <lb/>
her sympathy.</p>
<pb n="239" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0246"/>
<p>In the midst of her valued labours, just as a new <lb/>
hospital was being erected, in which she hoped to <lb/>
spend many useful years, cancer developed itself, and <lb/>
she was told that she must die. The trial was severe, <lb/>
but her life had been a preparation for any event <lb/>
that her Father might send her. If her opportunity <lb/>
for work was limited, the more need that every <lb/>
moment should be employed; and it was employed, <lb/>
both inside and outside the hospital, as though every <lb/>
moment was the prelude to the last. Every moment <lb/>
was grudged that was not usefully used. All her <lb/>
evenings were spent in visiting, not merely the <reg orig="re-|spectable">respectable</reg>, <lb/>
for whom she had earnest words, but, as <lb/>
she called them, the rag-tags of the town. No time <lb/>
spent with the poorest who were hastening to the <lb/>
grave was grudged. Many a wretched creature <lb/>
breathed her last breath while reposing upon Dora's <lb/>
breast; and none departed without the way of <lb/>
life being made plain. Her midnight meetings, <lb/>
which were continued, opened every door to her in <lb/>
the vilest slums of the town; and wherever she <lb/>
went, into whatever company, deference and respect, <lb/>
instead of insults and injury, were shown to Dora. <lb/>
But strong as her frame had been&mdash;and it must have <lb/>
been made of iron, not to have been weakened by <lb/>
her many labours&mdash;it now gave evidence of the <reg orig="exist-|ence">existence</reg> <lb/>
of disease which could not be concealed. But <lb/>
this in no way was permitted to interfere with her <lb/>
work. The pony-carriage was still employed in <lb/>
<pb n="240" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0247"/>
the evenings, not only to carry her to the poor people <lb/>
in the town, but to the outlying villages where <lb/>
there were any sick to be succoured or <reg orig="wretched-|ness">wretchedness</reg> <lb/>
to be relieved. Her many patients and poor <lb/>
friends who looked to her for material and spiritual <lb/>
aid, had no idea that Sister Dora had a disease that <lb/>
would only terminate with her death. She went <lb/>
about her work with her old spirit and cheerfulness; <lb/>
the canker-worm which was eating out her life was <lb/>
concealed from every eye, and was not revealed to <lb/>
relative or the dearest friend. One reason, and the <lb/>
reason is not difficult to understand in Dora, was <lb/>
that she had a dread of sympathy and pity. While <lb/>
no good could come of such expressions and <reg orig="exhibi-|tions">exhibitions</reg> <lb/>
of feeling, her labours would be interfered with, <lb/>
and she would be prevented from pursuing her work <lb/>
in her own way.</p>
<p>As the old hospital had to be pulled down before <lb/>
the new one could be finished, Dora had at length <lb/>
the opportunity for a much-needed holiday. She <lb/>
went first to spend a few days with her nieces in the <lb/>
Isle of Man, where she exhibited all the exuberance <lb/>
of spirits which had always characterized her. <reg orig="After-|wards">Afterwards</reg> <lb/>
she went to Paris to see and study in the <lb/>
Exhibition the wonderful instruments and appliances <lb/>
used in surgical operations. She did this knowing <lb/>
the brief period which would be permitted to her to <lb/>
use the knowledge thus acquired. On returning to <lb/>
London she obtained permission to attend and <reg orig="wit-|ness">witness</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="241" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0248"/>
Professor Lister's operations, with the view of <lb/>
introducing his system of treatment of wounds into the <lb/>
Walsall Hospital. But now that which was of most <lb/>
concern was the terrible disease which could no <lb/>
longer be concealed in her own frame. One of the <lb/>
London doctors proposed to examine her chest; but <lb/>
this would have revealed all,&mdash;an exposure to a <lb/>
stranger of the certain seeds of death from which <lb/>
she shrank with unconcealed dread. She hastened <lb/>
to consult her former medical adviser in Birmingham, <lb/>
the journey adding materially to the worst symptoms <lb/>
of the fatal disease, so that it almost seemed that she <lb/>
would never leave the hotel in which she had taken <lb/>
her residence alive. Her strong desire was now to <lb/>
go to Walsall, earnestly and fervently expressed, <lb/>
"Let me die among my own people." When it was <lb/>
possible to remove her, she was carefully taken to a <lb/>
small house in Walsall, hastily prepared for her, as <lb/>
the new hospital was not ready to receive her.</p>
<p>But in the midst of all this sorrow and suffering, <lb/>
Dora's faith and assurance were firm and immovable. <lb/>
She wrote to a friend: "I can join in the words <lb/>
of our beautiful Prayer-book,&mdash;'Render unto Him <lb/>
humble thanks for his fatherly visitation!' Do <lb/>
pray, dear brother, that, as my pain increases, so may <lb/>
my faith and patience. I have not had two hours' <lb/>
sleep for four days and nights; but in the midst of <lb/>
the fiery furnace there was a form like unto the Son <lb/>
of God." But the dear people whom Dora had so <lb/>
<pb n="242" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0249"/>
tenderly and lovingly served would not believe that <lb/>
Dora was to die. "Her'll get well," "Her never can <lb/>
be going to die," were the general expressions. They <lb/>
could not think that the strong woman they had <lb/>
seen in the hospital lifting them about as if they <lb/>
were children, was going to die. When, however, <lb/>
they learned that there was no hope, that Dora must <lb/>
die, the feeling of pain which settled upon the hearts <lb/>
of the people is indescribable. Up to the last they <lb/>
hoped against hope, trusting that in some way God <lb/>
in his own good providence would restore to them <lb/>
Sister Dora. But it was not to be. Through much <lb/>
pain and suffering the end was speedily to come. <lb/>
But it was not to come without hope. The hope <lb/>
which filled Dora's heart as she lay upon her <reg orig="death-|bed">deathbed</reg> <lb/>
was well expressed in the hymn which she loved, <lb/>
"Rest comes at length, though life be long and <lb/>
weary." Writing from her bed of continual pain, <lb/>
she said: "My heart is so full of thankfulness for <lb/>
the Good Shepherd's tender care and love towards <lb/>
me. I am so happy. I have not a care; it is all <lb/>
sunshine. God has taken away the fear of death, <lb/>
and all sorrow at parting with life." This hopeful, <lb/>
glad spirit was at times clouded with doubts and <lb/>
fears; and as her disease increased, so did its pains, <lb/>
until she was compelled, with all her brave heroic spirit, <lb/>
to confess that she was suffering torture! "But," she <lb/>
would add, "I want it all; the more I suffer, the <lb/>
more I feel I need it. I am in God's hands now."</p>
<pb n="243" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0250"/>
<p>While she lay thus suffering upon her death-bed, <lb/>
the new hospital was opened&mdash;opened in Dora's <lb/>
name, without her longed-for and desired presence. <lb/>
Her sufferings, which had now become continuous <lb/>
and intense, did not prevent her from taking the <lb/>
keenest interest in its every detail, and discussing <lb/>
with the surgeon and the nurses the best plans for <lb/>
its successful working. The several cases, as they <lb/>
were brought into the hospital, were reported to her, <lb/>
and instructions as to treatment and nursing were <lb/>
received from her. In the midst of all her pain she <lb/>
never, if possible, refused to see visitors, receiving <lb/>
them with much cheerfulness, and speaking kind and <lb/>
encouraging words. As the end approached, one <lb/>
who was constantly with Dora wrote: "I feel that I <lb/>
cannot give you any true idea of those last hours <lb/>
that I spent with her, or of the vivid remembrance I <lb/>
have of her, as her brave and loving spirit waited for <lb/>
the moment when God would call her to the full, <reg orig="un-|clouded">unclouded</reg> <lb/>
daylight of eternity, into the dawn of which <lb/>
she seemed already to have entered." It was on the <lb/>
24th day of December 1878 that Dora entered her <lb/>
eternal home. She had for two days passed through <lb/>
intense suffering with great resignation and patience. <lb/>
As the next day was Christmas-day, Dora cried <reg orig="re-|peatedly">repeatedly</reg>, <lb/>
"Oh, I hope I shall sing my Christmas <lb/>
carol in heaven!" All doubts were now gone,&mdash;she <lb/>
saw the Lord Jesus at the gates of heaven, the gates <lb/>
of which were open wide to receive her. And then, <lb/>
<pb n="244" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0251"/>
when the last moments were come, she said to the <lb/>
many kind friends who filled the room, "I have lived <lb/>
alone, let me die alone," and only ceased repeating <lb/>
the words, "let me die alone," when all had left. <lb/>
One friend, however, would watch through the <reg orig="half-|opened">half-opened</reg> <lb/>
door. For some hours she still lived on; and <lb/>
then, about two in the afternoon, by a change in <lb/>
Dora's position, the watcher knew that she had <reg orig="de-|parted">departed</reg> <lb/>
to that home where pain and suffering give <lb/>
place to peace and joy.</p>
<p>The funeral, which had all been arranged by Dora, <lb/>
was to be plainly and quietly conducted, without <lb/>
scarfs, hat-bands, or trappings of any kind; and, if <lb/>
possible, the coffin was to be carried to the grave by <lb/>
some of the railway servants whom she had nursed <lb/>
in the hospital. This wish was immediately <reg orig="re-|sponded">responded</reg> <lb/>
to by eighteen men who volunteered to be <lb/>
her bearers. The funeral procession needed not <reg orig="out-|ward">outward</reg> <lb/>
trappings to indicate the sorrow felt by the <lb/>
thousands who followed the dear remains of Dora. <lb/>
The rich and the poor, men of all churches and creeds, <lb/>
joined lovingly together to pay a last tribute to the <lb/>
noble woman who had spent her life, like her divine <lb/>
Master, "going about doing good." No wonder that <lb/>
the many whom she had served, and to whom her <lb/>
presence had been a joy and delight, desired that a <lb/>
monument should be erected to her memory; not <lb/>
that they needed to be reminded of her, but, as one <lb/>
of the railway men said, "Nobody knows better <lb/>
<pb n="245" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0252"/>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> words of good George Herbert were <lb/>
never better illustrated than in the life of <lb/>
Eleanor Brennan, who, all unconsciously, <lb/>
showed how brave and true a life may be <lb/>
lived amid poverty and in low-down places. Nelly <lb/>
&lpar;as she was familiarly called&rpar;, who was born in <lb/>
Douglas, Isle of Man, was enabled, with a heart full <lb/>
of love, to make her poor life blossom as the rose, <lb/>
which was owned and blessed by the Master. Her <lb/>
father, a sailor, before her birth died far away from <lb/>
his home, leaving his wife in delicate health and in <lb/>
very needy circumstances. Little did the poor <lb/>
mother think, when the helpless and fatherless babe <lb/>
<pb n="247" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0254"/>
was put into her arms, that it would be the support <lb/>
and comfort of her life, and an honour and a blessing <lb/>
to the town in which it was born. The poor mother <lb/>
realized that which has so often been experienced, <lb/>
that sorrows are converted into joys, trials and <lb/>
troubles into aids and helps. When the <reg orig="bread-|winner">breadwinner</reg> <lb/>
had gone, the poor widow had to cast about <lb/>
for the ways and means of living. A mangle, the <lb/>
resort of many poor widows, was purchased, and most <lb/>
industriously used for several years. Meanwhile <lb/>
little Nelly grew up grave, gentle, and thoughtful, <lb/>
as if conscious of the load of care that would <reg orig="pre-|sently">presently</reg> <lb/>
devolve upon her. Her mother, always <reg orig="deli-|cate">delicate</reg>, <lb/>
never recovered the imperfect strength she <lb/>
enjoyed prior to her husband's death, and became a <lb/>
confirmed invalid, unable to sustain the light task of <lb/>
folding the clothes before being put into the mangle. <lb/>
This labour had to be undertaken by Nelly; and as <lb/>
she was too little to reach over the table, she had to <lb/>
stand upon a stool. The servants bringing clothes <lb/>
assisted the little girl to work the mangle. Mrs. <lb/>
Brennan, becoming daily worse, required constant <lb/>
care; and as Nelly could not leave the mangle, the <lb/>
mother's bed was removed to the work-room, so that <lb/>
Nelly could run from her work to the bedside of the <lb/>
sufferer and minister in the many kindly offices so <lb/>
much needed by her loved parent.</p>
<p>When Nelly had attained her sixteenth year, her <lb/>
mother, after a protracted and patient illness, died. <lb/>
<pb n="248" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0255"/>
Her last moments were imbittered by the sense of the <lb/>
poverty by which she was surrounded, and the <reg orig="con-|sciousness">consciousness</reg> <lb/>
that it was the only patrimony she could <lb/>
leave her much-enduring and ardently-loved daughter. <lb/>
Her poverty was so great that had it not been for <lb/>
assistance she must have been laid in a pauper's <lb/>
grave. Happily the probity, stability, and <reg orig="self-|dependence">self-dependence</reg> <lb/>
of Nelly had been observed, so that she <lb/>
was enabled to obtain the loan of a little money to <lb/>
purchase a grave in which to place the honoured <lb/>
remains of her mother reverently and decently. This <lb/>
loan, by economy and incessant labour, was soon <lb/>
gratefully returned. Notwithstanding that she had <lb/>
to work far into the night to enable her to return <lb/>
the borrowed money, next morning and every <reg orig="morn-|ing">morning</reg> <lb/>
she would be found among the worshippers at <lb/>
the six o'clock service in the church where her <lb/>
mother was laid.</p>
<p>The curate who conducted these daily early <reg orig="ser-|vices">services</reg> <lb/>
noticed Nelly as a girl of modest, serious <lb/>
demeanour, who was never absent, whatever the <lb/>
state of the weather. When these services were <lb/>
relinquished, she joined a small company which met <lb/>
in a neighbouring chapel at six o'clock on the Sabbath <lb/>
mornings. The zeal and earnestness of the humble <lb/>
but devout worshippers induced Nelly to attach <reg orig="her-|self">herself</reg> <lb/>
to the congregation, which connection continued <lb/>
without a break for fifty years.</p>
<p>On the death of her mother, friends would have <lb/>
<pb n="249" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0256"/>
desired that Nelly should obtain a situation as a <lb/>
domestic servant, and this, probably, would have <lb/>
been her own wish; but her mother, on the contrary, <lb/>
desired that the mangle should not be sold, nor her <lb/>
humble home broken up. This wish of her mother <lb/>
was a sacred command to Nelly. The mangle was <lb/>
therefore kept in its place, and all went on as usual. <lb/>
Had it been otherwise, the opportunities for <reg orig="useful-|ness">usefulness</reg> <lb/>
which were presented and embraced in Nelly's <lb/>
subsequent life would have been lost. Her character <lb/>
had, even at this early stage of her career, become <lb/>
so settled and confirmed in the path of rectitude <lb/>
and propriety that all were assured that her isolated <lb/>
and independent position had for her no temptation <lb/>
to wander from the line of duty. In her daily work, <lb/>
clothes-mangling, she illustrated the saying of Baxter, <lb/>
"If a Christian be but a shoe-black, he should be the <lb/>
best shoe-black in the parish;" and certainly no <lb/>
mangling was done better than in Nelly's home. <lb/>
The result was that "the first people in the town" <lb/>
sent their clothes. The servants, however, who <reg orig="con-|sidered">considered</reg> <lb/>
"the mangle" as the proper place for gossip, <lb/>
were checked in their talk by the young housekeeper, <lb/>
who offered them, in the place of accustomed <reg orig="detrac-|tion">detraction</reg>, <lb/>
sympathy and kind words. In this way many <lb/>
friendships were commenced which had important <reg orig="re-|sults">results</reg> <lb/>
in after life. Any of her friends, whose <reg orig="friend-|ship">friendship</reg> <lb/>
was thus formed, when out of situations made <lb/>
Nelly's house their home until employment was found.</p>
<pb n="250" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0257"/>
<p>After a few years had been spent thus <reg orig="industri-|ously">industriously</reg> <lb/>
and usefully, Nelly was offered the situation <lb/>
of laundress at Castle Mona, the chief hotel on the <lb/>
island, beautifully situated on the margin of Douglas <lb/>
Bay. In accepting this situation, she made a mistake: <lb/>
her happiness consisted in ministering to the poor <lb/>
and the sick; the comforts of her new home did not <lb/>
compensate for the opportunities of usefulness. The <lb/>
committee of the Insular Hospital, however, having <lb/>
noticed Nelly's sympathy for suffering, offered her <lb/>
the position of matron, which, as it promised to <lb/>
bring her into connection with her loved duties, she <lb/>
cheerfully accepted; and only retired when failing <lb/>
health warned her that her strength was not equal <lb/>
to the confinement and the entailed labour. She <lb/>
again, therefore, entered upon the responsibilities of <lb/>
house-keeping, letting apartments to summer <reg orig="visi-|tors">visitors</reg>, <lb/>
an employment which she continued for the <reg orig="re-|mainder">remainder</reg> <lb/>
of her days.</p>
<p>In the great cholera visitation the Isle of Man was <lb/>
for a long time free from the fatal scourge. When <lb/>
it was found to have visited Douglas, many of the <lb/>
inhabitants fled to distant parts of the island in the <lb/>
hope of escaping the dreaded infection. Such was <lb/>
the fear of coming in contact with any one connected <lb/>
with the sufferers, or with those who had died of the <lb/>
disease, that few were found willing, even amongst <lb/>
the most benevolent, to render any help beyond that <lb/>
of sending money and food to the dwellings where <lb/>
<pb n="251" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0258"/>
poverty added its sting to the pestilence. Kindly <lb/>
intended aid and help of this kind was of little use <lb/>
to sufferers agonized with cholera. Who was there <lb/>
to purchase food, or to prepare it when purchased, <lb/>
in the pestilence-stricken dwellings? The medical <lb/>
men could do little more than hasten from one <lb/>
afflicted house to another. Nurses could scarcely be <lb/>
procured, or bribed, even by the wealthy. A few <lb/>
wretched women of dissipated habits were tempted <lb/>
by money, immediately spent upon intoxicating drink, <lb/>
to perform needful offices for the dead rather than <lb/>
the dying. But Nelly, with a courage as great or <lb/>
greater than that which has immortalized heroes, <lb/>
without any other stimulus than that of duty, flew <lb/>
with swift and willing feet to the bedsides of the <lb/>
poor sufferers. Her aid, however, was not given to <lb/>
friends and acquaintances merely. The claims which <lb/>
she acknowledged, and which obtained her ready <lb/>
services, were wretchedness, poverty, and the <reg orig="pesti-|lence">pestilence</reg>. <lb/>
The sufferers from these evils immediately <lb/>
became her friends and the subjects of her personal <lb/>
care. Quietly and energetically carrying out the <lb/>
directions of the medical men, she became to them, <lb/>
in their efforts to subdue the scourge which was <lb/>
afflicting the town, an invaluable aid. She had no <lb/>
fears for herself. She believed and trusted in the <lb/>
care and providence of her heavenly Father. Had it <lb/>
been God's will that she should become a victim to <lb/>
the pestilence, cheerfully and resignedly would she <lb/>
<pb n="252" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0259"/>
have yielded her life to him who gave it, with the <lb/>
reliant and loving assurance that he does all things <lb/>
well. What she had to do, and what she did with <lb/>
the heroism of a noble heroine, was to help the <lb/>
wretched victims who were left helpless by the <lb/>
paralyzed inhabitants. No office or duty was too <lb/>
repugnant for her willing hands; no labours were too <lb/>
heavy. In the midst of her many cares for the body, <lb/>
she was not, however, unmindful of the greater <lb/>
interests of the soul. Many a poor creature, just on <lb/>
the confines of the other world, found an interest in <lb/>
the promises left for the hope and encouragement of <lb/>
the sorrowing and repentant, through her teaching. <lb/>
Earnestly, oh, how earnestly! did she offer up simple <lb/>
prayers for those for whom there was no hope in <lb/>
this life. There were others, however, who were <lb/>
like brands snatched from the burning, raised up <lb/>
from beds of despair, and who had learned during <lb/>
their illness to pray for themselves. Subsequently, <lb/>
when the plague had departed, these new converts <lb/>
were accustomed to meet in her home to join in a <lb/>
simple service of praise and prayer.</p>
<p>The Rev. T. Howard, the incumbent of St. George's <lb/>
Church, speaking of the cholera visitation, said: <lb/>
"There were very few houses I was sent for to visit <lb/>
in which I did not see Nelly sitting by the bed of <lb/>
the sick and the dying, endeavouring to direct them to <lb/>
that blessed Saviour from whom alone they could <lb/>
obtain comfort and salvation. Nothing could be <lb/>
<pb n="253" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0260"/>
more disinterested, benevolent, or humane than her <lb/>
attention to the sick at that time. Had she been <lb/>
offered a liberal reward for waiting upon the afflicted, <lb/>
she could not have been more attentive to them. <lb/>
But her charity was truly Christian charity; it <reg orig="pro-|ceeded">proceeded</reg> <lb/>
from pure love to her fellow-creatures. She <lb/>
well knew at the time that she was exposing her <lb/>
own life to the most imminent danger; but she rose <lb/>
above every selfish consideration." When the cholera <lb/>
had departed, a sum of money was raised by public <lb/>
subscription, to be presented to her as a testimonial <lb/>
in recognition of her services during the fearful <lb/>
cholera visitation. This she at once declined, and <lb/>
was only induced to accept the gift, after much <reg orig="im-|portuning">importuning</reg>, <lb/>
on condition that she might apply it to <lb/>
some charitable object.</p>
<p>The cholera left in Douglas many helpless orphans, <lb/>
&mdash;one poor widow leaving several forlorn children, <lb/>
one of whom, a little girl six years old, on the night <lb/>
of her mother's death wandered about the fields until <lb/>
found in the morning by Nelly, who took her home <lb/>
as her adopted child, quite assured that means would <lb/>
be found to feed and educate the little forsaken <lb/>
wanderer. Her hopes were not disappointed. One <lb/>
lady sent money, and another took upon herself the <lb/>
charge of educating the poor child. Many children <lb/>
were in this way provided and cared for by Nelly. <lb/>
Another of these helpless little ones, the daughter of <lb/>
a Roman Catholic, died in her house of consumption. <lb/>
<pb n="254" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0261"/>
Nelly had, however, pointed her to the Saviour; and <lb/>
when death came, she joyfully cried, "She has gone <lb/>
safe home." Another little girl, when too old to be <lb/>
carried about by heartless parents to excite sympathy <lb/>
by begging, was left in pitiable destitution. Nelly <lb/>
took the child into her own house, adopting it as her <lb/>
own, and tending it with the care of a loving mother. <lb/>
She was, however, assisted in her many good works <lb/>
by the affluent and charitable inhabitants of the <lb/>
town, who deemed it a privilege to assist Nelly in <lb/>
her Christ-like work. She received the money put <lb/>
into her hands as a personal benefit, of which she <lb/>
rendered to the donors a strict account. To one lady <lb/>
she would say, "O ma'am, poor Betty was so <reg orig="thank-|ful">thankful</reg> <lb/>
for the grain of tea you sent her;" to another <lb/>
she would say, "Old Nanny says you have quite set <lb/>
her up with the new cloak." The ladies would, of <lb/>
course, discard any praise, knowing well that had it <lb/>
not been for Nelly's loving heart the kind deed would <lb/>
have been left undone.</p>
<p>Dispensing gifts, however, was the least of Nelly's <lb/>
services. Her true worth was seen in personal work. <lb/>
On one occasion, hearing of a poor creature stricken <lb/>
with fever, and that, owing to her diseased and <reg orig="infec-|tious">infectious</reg> <lb/>
condition, no one would go near her, <reg orig="notwith-|standing">notwithstanding</reg> <lb/>
that a reward was offered to any who would <lb/>
assist her, Nelly braved all danger, and alone <reg orig="under-|took">undertook</reg> <lb/>
the dangerous duty of tending and aiding the <lb/>
poor woman. When surprise was expressed at her <lb/>
<pb n="255" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0262"/>
voluntarily exposing herself to the contamination of <lb/>
infectious disease, she would answer, "What the love <lb/>
of money could not do, the love of Christ constrained <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">me</hi> to do." Upon another occasion a woman had <lb/>
been left to perish in a fever-infected room. Without <lb/>
a thought of herself, Nelly was soon by her side, <lb/>
breathing the fetid air and braving the dread disease. <lb/>
Nelly's experience told her that there was no hope <lb/>
for the recovery of the sick woman unless she could <lb/>
be removed into a cleaner and purer atmosphere. A <lb/>
room was obtained on the opposite side of the street, <lb/>
when the difficulty occurred, How was the invalid to <lb/>
be got into it? The poor woman could not walk, and <lb/>
Nelly was unable to carry her. Standing at the <lb/>
street door, perplexed with the dilemma in which she <lb/>
found herself, she accosted the first two decent-<reg orig="look-|ing">looking</reg> <lb/>
men she saw passing, praying them to assist her <lb/>
to remove the sick woman from one side of the street <lb/>
to the other. Without a thought of any personal <lb/>
danger, they immediately complied with the novel <lb/>
request, and were no doubt as pleased to render the <lb/>
service as Nelly was to obtain it.</p>
<p>One day Nelly heard of a most distressing case <lb/>
of seven wretched creatures, victims of typhus, lying <lb/>
in one room. When she entered the room&mdash;for of <lb/>
course she had no other thought than of doing so&mdash; <lb/>
she saw a sad, heart-rending scene. Fear of contagion <lb/>
had driven the neighbours away, and the miserable <lb/>
family was left to the mercy of the infectious disease. <lb/>
<pb n="256" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0263"/>
Nelly did what she could, but death had already <lb/>
seized upon the poor parents. The father was the <lb/>
first to succumb. After "fixing him," as Nelly called <lb/>
laying out the corpse&mdash;for none would go near the <lb/>
infected room to help her&mdash;she procured a parish <lb/>
coffin, and lifted the dead man into it, as none of the <lb/>
undertaker's men would enter the house. Then came <lb/>
the difficulty of getting the coffin to the churchyard. <lb/>
It was useless to expect the neighbours to carry it to <lb/>
the grave, the common custom amongst the poor of <lb/>
the Isle of Man, as all were paralyzed by dread. At <lb/>
length, after much soliciting, she induced the owner <lb/>
of a coal cart to carry the coffin to the grave, but <lb/>
nothing would induce him to assist in taking it down <lb/>
to the cart. In this emergency Nelly placed the <lb/>
coffin at the door, and bribed a poor woman to help <lb/>
her to carry the ghastly corpse downstairs, and again <lb/>
put it into the coffin, when the owner of the cart, for <lb/>
very shame, assisted to lift it into the rough <reg orig="con-|veyance">conveyance</reg>. <lb/>
A few more days, and the mother of the <lb/>
stricken children died, when the sad scene had again <lb/>
to be enacted; but then, as Nelly said, "the poor <lb/>
thing was not so heavy as her husband." When the <lb/>
grave closed over the parents, heavier duties were <lb/>
claimed by the forlorn children. Their stronger <reg orig="con-|stitutions">constitutions</reg> <lb/>
carried them through the disease, leaving <lb/>
them fearfully weak, and demanding constant care <lb/>
and nourishment, if they were to live. Many a weary <lb/>
climb up the stairs had Nelly with food for the <reg orig="dis-|consolate">disconsolate</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="257" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0264"/>
children. In this humane work she was <lb/>
assisted by the doctor, a feeling, kind-hearted man, <lb/>
who had been induced to visit the house. Many a <lb/>
jug of sago and bottle of wine he carried with him <lb/>
on his visits. But Nelly had other duties besides <lb/>
procuring food for the children. She had to clean <lb/>
the room, bathe and wash the children, and when <lb/>
they were able to rise from their beds, to assist them <lb/>
to put on their "bits of things," light the fire, make <lb/>
the tea, and prepare the food she had brought with <lb/>
her, thus becoming to the orphans mother, nurse, <reg orig="ser-|vant">servant</reg>, <lb/>
and benefactress. The next duty Nelly <reg orig="under-|took">undertook</reg> <lb/>
was to interest friends in the condition of the <lb/>
children. Her prayers and solicitations were <reg orig="success-|ful">successful</reg>. <lb/>
She had the happiness of seeing them provided <lb/>
with all that they required while young, and, indeed, <lb/>
until they were able to provide for themselves.</p>
<p>The medical men were not slow or unwilling to <lb/>
recognize the aid they received from Nelly's <reg orig="self-|denying">self-denying</reg> <lb/>
labours. One of them, on meeting a <reg orig="con-|valescent">convalescent</reg> <lb/>
patient, said, "I may speak with you now, for <lb/>
I have just been taking a bath to prevent the bad <lb/>
effects of the fetid air in a wretched room. I was <lb/>
glad to rush out of the room, where I left that devoted <lb/>
woman, Miss Brennan, performing the most <reg orig="loath-|some">loathsome</reg> <lb/>
offices with skill and tenderness beyond all <lb/>
praise." Nelly, however, was not without fear or <lb/>
heedless of the dangers she incurred; but, as she <lb/>
remarked to a lady who sympathized with her work, <lb/>
<pb n="258" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0265"/>
"I use the means for preserving health, and pray to <lb/>
the Lord to keep me in safety; and blessed be his <lb/>
holy name, he has enabled me to go in and out among <lb/>
them poor things thirty-nine years in safety."</p>
<p>Nelly was not less interested in the removal of <lb/>
moral than of physical evil; to either work she would <lb/>
devote patience and untiring energy. On one <reg orig="occa-|sion">occasion</reg>, <lb/>
several poor creatures who had lost all sense <lb/>
of female propriety, and had become unconscious of <lb/>
shame, strongly excited her sympathy and interest. <lb/>
Her prayers and entreaties were at length successful; <lb/>
the young women were brought to see the error of <lb/>
their lives, and would fain have gone back to their <lb/>
homes and the innocence of their early years. This, <lb/>
alas! could not be. Their mothers had died with <lb/>
broken hearts, and their fathers would no longer own <lb/>
them as children, or permit them to reside in their <lb/>
homes. Nelly at once took them to her little place, <lb/>
shared with them her hard-earned meals, and taught <lb/>
them by her pure, holy, and busy life the happiness <lb/>
of a return to the paths of virtue. Nelly, on <reg orig="an-|other">another</reg> <lb/>
occasion, was asked to pray with a wretched <lb/>
creature who lived unmarried with a man in a place <lb/>
described as a miserable hole. "No," she replied, "I <lb/>
cannot pray <hi rend="italic">with</hi> her&mdash;I could have no access to <lb/>
God; but I will pray <hi rend="italic">for</hi> her." Then, using every <lb/>
effort for the restoration of the guilty pair, aiding <lb/>
them by material help and wise counsel, she had the <lb/>
happiness to see the poor woman restored to health <lb/>
<pb n="259" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0266"/>
and then married to the man who long previously <lb/>
ought to have been her husband.</p>
<p>Nelly regularly visited the cholera hospital, and <lb/>
ministered to the stricken inmates with her own <lb/>
hands. Her friends and customers, fearful of the <lb/>
communication of the contagion, declined sending <lb/>
clothes to her to be mangled. This considerably <reg orig="re-|duced">reduced</reg> <lb/>
her means of living; notwithstanding, as was <lb/>
her custom, she gave two days of the week to <reg orig="collect-|ing">collecting</reg> <lb/>
for and visiting the poor. Straitened in her <lb/>
circumstances, she was never heard to complain; and <lb/>
had it not been for the offer of the matronship of the <lb/>
hospital, it would never have been known how near <lb/>
she had been to actual want. "That offer," she said, <lb/>
"is sent by Providence, like the twelve guineas that <lb/>
Mrs. W<gap desc="long dash" reason="missing" id="g2"/> brought me." That providential <reg orig="inter-|position">interposition</reg>, <lb/>
as Nelly firmly believed it to be, occurred on <lb/>
the occasion of an attack of illness&mdash;possibly induced <lb/>
by want of proper nourishment&mdash;as she lay in bed <lb/>
without the means of purchasing a cup of tea, for <lb/>
which she had a strong desire. "My dear," she said, <lb/>
when relating the circumstance, "the idea of dying <lb/>
of want came across me; but very soon the words <lb/>
came into my mind with power, 'The Lord is my <lb/>
Shepherd; I shall not want.' I repeated the words <lb/>
aloud, 'No, I <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> not want.' I heard a gentle tap <lb/>
at the door. I said, 'Come in, if you please,' for I was <lb/>
not able to rise. Mrs. W<gap desc="long dash" reason="missing" id="g3"/> came in <hi rend="italic">with a purse <lb/>
of twelve guineas!</hi>" Deeming this a direct gift from <lb/>
<pb n="260" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0267"/>
her heavenly Father, she would only devote a small <lb/>
portion of the money to her own necessities; the <reg orig="re-|mainder">remainder</reg> <lb/>
was given to the poor. The appointment to <lb/>
the hospital came at a time when Nelly was in needy <lb/>
circumstances. A lady who had influence in making <lb/>
the appointment was strongly impressed by a dream <lb/>
that Nelly was depressed by poverty, and, although <lb/>
assured by her friends that this was not the case, she <lb/>
acted upon her dream impression, and obtained for <lb/>
Nelly, as has been intimated, the offer of the <reg orig="matron-|ship">matronship</reg> <lb/>
of the hospital, which was most gratefully <reg orig="ac-|cepted">accepted</reg>, <lb/>
not alone on account of the personal <reg orig="advan-|tages">advantages</reg> <lb/>
&lpar;&pound;10 a year and a home in the hospital&rpar;, but <lb/>
because the employment would bring her in contact <lb/>
with her loved suffering poor. A year and a half of <lb/>
the labour proved that her strength was not adequate <lb/>
to the many arduous duties. "Words," said a visitor, <lb/>
"are not equal to describe her works and labours of <lb/>
love in the hospital. No money could have <reg orig="remun-|erated">remunerated</reg> <lb/>
her for all she went through there. Daily did <lb/>
she wash with her own hands the deeply afflicted <lb/>
inmates. Her sympathy for the suffering body was <lb/>
only equalled by her anxiety for the soul. Love to <lb/>
the Saviour was her constraining motive. She went <lb/>
from room to room reading and praying until her <lb/>
health gave way, when she was obliged to tender her <lb/>
resignation, to the great regret of all connected with <lb/>
the hospital."</p>
<p>No sooner, however, was Nelly away from the <lb/>
<pb n="261" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0268"/>
hospital than she was at her work of help and <reg orig="ser-|vice">service</reg>. <lb/>
A poor boy who, without relatives or friends, <lb/>
had been terribly neglected, was in so sad and <reg orig="loath-|some">loathsome</reg> <lb/>
a condition that the neighbours refused to be <lb/>
bribed to attend him or even to go near him. Nelly, <lb/>
when she heard of the case, was soon at the bedside <lb/>
of the afflicted lad, ministering in all kindly offices,&mdash; <lb/>
making his bed, changing his linen, washing his sores, <lb/>
and applying such remedies as her experience <reg orig="sug-|gested">suggested</reg>. <lb/>
But not only was she a friend, an aid and <lb/>
a help to the poor, but to the rich and well-to-do was <lb/>
she a much-desired companion and assistant in the <lb/>
sick-room. None could so kindly and gently soothe <lb/>
pain and irritation, cheer the desponding, or allay <lb/>
fear. Many joyous instances are recorded of her <lb/>
spiritual aid and help&mdash;of spiritual trust and <reg orig="depend-|ence">dependence</reg> <lb/>
prompted by her counsels and aided by her <lb/>
prayers. Those who witnessed her works of love <lb/>
describe her countenance as radiant, and that it was <lb/>
a remembered privilege to be allowed to join her in <lb/>
her cottage devotions. These services on the Sabbath <lb/>
commenced at five in the morning, to which all were <lb/>
invited and heartily welcomed. She had then no <lb/>
doubts. Her unfaltering trust in her heavenly <lb/>
Father's promises enabled her to rest in peace, calmly <lb/>
confident that the gifts and graces, the help and <reg orig="assur-|ance">assurance</reg> <lb/>
promised to the believer would not be denied to <lb/>
her earnest prayers. And Nelly averred that they <lb/>
never were. But while she prayed she worked. She <lb/>
<pb n="262" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0269"/>
knew&mdash;none knew better&mdash;that God's blessings <reg orig="fol-|low">follow</reg> <lb/>
efforts; and none made them more perseveringly, <lb/>
trustfully, or prayerfully than Nelly.</p>
<p>When a Dorcas Society was established in Douglas <lb/>
as a memorial of the cholera visitation, and as a living <lb/>
active means of usefulness, Nelly became one of its <lb/>
first and most energetic supporters; and when the <lb/>
members met at her house to make garments for the <lb/>
poor, a holy delight spread over her peaceful <reg orig="coun-|tenance">countenance</reg>. <lb/>
She and her visitors were engaged doing <lb/>
the Master's will and work, and that was happiness!</p>
<p>The foul air of many infected dwellings, the <reg orig="re-|peated">repeated</reg> <lb/>
and continued fatigues incidental to many <lb/>
sickbed watchings, the labours of a busy life, at <lb/>
length told upon her constitution and brought her to <lb/>
the end. When implored by a friend to take rest, <lb/>
she answered,&mdash;"My dear, I have so many things to <lb/>
do I cannot rest now. I have to gather clothes for a <lb/>
poor boy who is going to sea, to collect for the Dorcas <lb/>
Society, and many other things to get on with before <lb/>
Christmas." Before that festival arrived she lay <lb/>
upon the bed from which she was never removed <lb/>
alive. She had gone upon one of her messages of <lb/>
mercy, although very ill and quite unable to work, <lb/>
when she was seized with a fainting fit on the way. <lb/>
As she lay upon the sofa in a friend's house, fainting <lb/>
fit succeeded fainting fit, between which she was <lb/>
heard to say, "O ladies, dear ladies, the love of God <lb/>
is great;" and when taken home, and as she lay <lb/>
<pb n="263" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0270"/>
upon her bed, her constant utterance was, "My heart <lb/>
is overflowing with love to God and to man;" and then <lb/>
the end came. It is not wonderful that the <reg orig="inhabi-|tants">inhabitants</reg> <lb/>
of the Isle of Man treasure the memory of <lb/>
Eleanor Brennan. Well might Tennyson write:&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"Not once or twice in our rough island-story</l>
<l>The path of duty was the way to glory:</l>
<l>He that walks it, only thirsting</l>
<l>For the right, and learns to deaden</l>
<l>Love of self, before his journey closes</l>
<l>He shall find the stubborn thistle bursting</l>
<l>Into glossy purples, which outredden</l>
<l>All voluptuous garden-roses.</l>
<l>Not once or twice in our fair island-story</l>
<l>The path of duty was the way to glory:</l>
<l>He that, ever following her commands,</l>
<l>On with toil of heart and knees and hands,</l>
<l>Through the long gorge to the far light has won</l>
<l>His path upward, and prevailed,</l>
<l>Shall find the toppling crags of duty scaled</l>
<l>Are close upon the shining table-lands</l>
<l>To which our God himself is moon and sun."</l>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">We</hi> owe to Christianity the fullest inspiration <lb/>
of the celestial spirit of poetry. Love is <lb/>
the fount and source of all true poetry&mdash;a <lb/>
divine glow and vision of the glories of <lb/>
earth, the radiance which comes from heaven, and the <lb/>
spring of joy in the heart. England's best poets have <lb/>
been Christian poets. They have sung of sorrows, of <lb/>
sins, of evils; but not less have they cheered and <lb/>
rejoiced the drooping and burdened heart, lifted the <lb/>
desponding above cares and troubles, and bade them <lb/>
bask in the smiles of their heavenly Father.</p>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"Ye have felt it! who the lyre</l>

<pb n="265" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0272"/>
<l>Within you&mdash;Poets! that our mystic world</l>
<l>Alone interpret, and to thought create</l>
<l>A richer paradise than Adam saw</l>
<l>Ere ruin fell on Eden's forfeit bowers."</l>
</lg></q>
<p>But how much greater the influence when verse is <lb/>
linked with music &mdash; music that has melted the <lb/>
hardest hearts and subdued the strongest passions! <lb/>
How often have men been restrained from evil, <reg orig="pre-|vented">prevented</reg> <lb/>
from the committal of some dark deed, by <lb/>
hearing a simple strain, first heard at a mother's <lb/>
knee, when the infant years were all unstained with <lb/>
sin and evil! Well might the poet say,&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"Of all the arts beneath the heaven,</l>
<l>That man has found, or God has given</l>
<l>None draws the soul so sweet away,</l>
<l>As music's melting, mystic lay;</l>
<l>Slight emblem of the bliss above,</l>
<l>It soothes the spirit all to love."</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>This combined power was possessed by Frances <lb/>
Ridley Havergal, and was devoted to the service of <lb/>
the Saviour, whom she followed through all the years <lb/>
of her life. She was born on the 14th of December <lb/>
1836, at Astley, Worcestershire, of which place her <lb/>
father was rector. She was a very charming child, <lb/>
and could speak plainly and prettily when two years <lb/>
old; and when three years, could read easy stories, <lb/>
and at that early age was often found under the <lb/>
table reading a book by herself. When she attained <lb/>
her fourth year, she could read the Bible and any <lb/>
ordinary book correctly, and had learned to write. <lb/>
French and music were gradually added, but much of <lb/>
<pb n="266" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0273"/>
her knowledge was self-acquired, as she never had a <lb/>
regular governess. When the services in the church <lb/>
on the Sunday were over, the family were gathered <lb/>
together to join in singing hymns, and, no doubt, <lb/>
anthems composed by her father, who, in the course <lb/>
of years, became eminent as the composer of cathedral <lb/>
services, many hundreds of chants and tunes and <lb/>
sacred songs. His first published piece of music was <lb/>
a setting of Bishop Heber's hymn, "From Greenland's <lb/>
icy mountains," the profits of which amounted to <lb/>
&pound;180, devoted by the author to the Church Missionary <lb/>
Society. He had also awarded to him two gold <lb/>
medals for the composition of a cathedral service and <lb/>
an anthem. His little daughter Frances, who followed <lb/>
in his steps as a composer of sweet music, had great <lb/>
aptitude for acquiring knowledge. When lessons in <lb/>
German were given to her brothers, she obtained a <lb/>
rudimentary knowledge of the language by listening <lb/>
to the lessons given by the teacher as she sat in the <lb/>
same room. When seven years old, she commenced <lb/>
to write in rhyme; and when nine, wrote long, <reg orig="amus-|ingly">amusingly</reg> <lb/>
descriptive letters to her young friends.</p>
<p>When she had attained her sixth year, she heard a <lb/>
sermon preached by Mr. Phillpots, which made a <lb/>
great impression upon her mind. "No one ever knew <lb/>
it," she wrote, "but this sermon haunted me; day and <lb/>
night it crossed me. I began to pray a good deal, <lb/>
though only night and morning, with a sort of fidget <lb/>
and impatience, almost angry at feeling so unhappy, <lb/>
<pb n="267" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0274"/>
and wanting and expecting to get a new heart, and <lb/>
have everything put straight and be made happy all <lb/>
at once." These thoughts she kept to herself, none <lb/>
suspecting the disturbance in her mind, and that she <lb/>
was not what she seemed&mdash;a rough, happy girl, fond <lb/>
of outdoor sports and climbing trees. Her mother's <lb/>
death, which occurred when she was eleven years old, <lb/>
deeply impressed her. Just before she died, she called <lb/>
her little girl to her bedside, and said: "Fanny dear, <lb/>
pray to God to prepare you for all that he is <reg orig="prepar-|ing">preparing</reg> <lb/>
for you."</p>
<p>The words, feebly and solemnly uttered, seemed to <lb/>
sound over and over again in the ears of Fanny. "I <lb/>
wonder what he is preparing for me," she thought. <lb/>
"Oh, I do hope he is preparing one of the many <reg orig="man-|sions">mansions</reg> <lb/>
for me! how I wish I knew whether he is! But <lb/>
I don't think he is preparing me for it, else I should <lb/>
not feel naughty so often."</p>
<p>That which was to happen, and for which she was <lb/>
not prepared, was the death of her dear mother; and <lb/>
even when all was over, and the spirit had departed <lb/>
to its eternal rest, Fanny would not believe but that <lb/>
she would wake up as out of sleep. Again and again <lb/>
she had gone to the room where her mother was laid, <lb/>
drawing the curtains aside, expecting to see the dear <lb/>
eyes unclose, and to feel the cold cheek warm again <lb/>
to her kiss. But she was gone, and all that remained <lb/>
was a smile of holy peace; and then Fanny knew that <lb/>
she was motherless.</p>
<pb n="268" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0275"/>
<p>This great deprivation caused Frances to think <lb/>
more and more of that peace and joy which others <lb/>
had, but which was denied to her. For a long period <lb/>
she kept silent, and the great desire of her heart was <lb/>
not known to her loving sisters and friends, who would <lb/>
so willingly have pointed her to the Saviour, and <lb/>
directed her simply to trust in him, and peace would <lb/>
have come to her heart. In the midst of her <reg orig="per-|plexity">perplexity</reg> <lb/>
she was sent to Mrs. Teed's school, where not <lb/>
only secular knowledge was carefully imparted, but <lb/>
that higher knowledge which makes the heart and <lb/>
life rich for all eternity.</p>
<p>There were several girls at school who had "put on <lb/>
Christ," who could be known by their "walk and <lb/>
conversation," almost by their very countenances, who <lb/>
took sweet counsel together. Frances, after many <lb/>
doubts and fears, spoke to one of these dear girls, who <lb/>
conversed with her very sweetly, and begged her "to <lb/>
go to Jesus and tell him she wanted to love him, and <lb/>
could not, and he would teach her."</p>
<p>At this time the serious and affectionate addresses <lb/>
of Mrs. Teed had caused a revival among the girls in <lb/>
the school; and day after day they would tell of the <lb/>
peace they had found and the joy which filled their <lb/>
hearts. But this peace was denied to Frances; "there <lb/>
was no voice nor any that answered." One of her <lb/>
companions, Diana, upon whom she centred all her <lb/>
earthly love, became the subject of much concern for <lb/>
her soul's salvation. One evening after tea, Diana <lb/>
<pb n="269" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0276"/>
threw her arms round the neck of Frances, saying, <lb/>
"O Fanny, dearest Fanny! the blessing has come to <lb/>
me at last. Jesus has forgiven me, I know. He is <lb/>
my Saviour, and I am so happy. He is such a <reg orig="Sav-|iour">Saviour</reg> <lb/>
as I never imagined&mdash;so good, so loving! He <lb/>
has not cast me out. He said so, and he says so to <lb/>
you. Only come to him and he will receive you. <lb/>
Even now he loves you, though you don't know it."</p>
<p>But Frances could not yet trust her Saviour, and <lb/>
the blessing she so ardently longed for was deferred. <lb/>
When the school-term was ended, and Frances was <lb/>
once more at home, she opened her heart to Miss <lb/>
Cooke, who was on a visit, and who afterwards <reg orig="be-|came">became</reg> <lb/>
her second mother. Frances told her how <lb/>
anxiously she desired to be forgiven. Brothers and <lb/>
sisters, all she loved, she could lose all if only she <lb/>
could obtain forgiveness.</p>
<p>"Then, Fanny," was the reply, "I think, <hi rend="italic">I am sure</hi>, <lb/>
it will not be long before your desire is granted, your <lb/>
hope fulfilled." Miss Cooke then added: "Why <reg orig="can-|not">cannot</reg> <lb/>
you trust your Saviour at once? Supposing that <lb/>
now, at this moment, Christ were to come in the <lb/>
clouds of heaven, and take up his redeemed, could <lb/>
you not trust him? Would not his call, his promise, <lb/>
be enough for you? Could you not commit your soul <lb/>
to him, to your Saviour, Jesus?"</p>
<p>A flash of hope came across Fanny. "I <hi rend="italic">could</hi>, <lb/>
surely," she said; and she ran to her room and fell on <lb/>
her knees, and tried to commit herself entirely to him <lb/>
<pb n="270" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0277"/>
on whom she had believed. Then and there, with <lb/>
much fear and trembling, she committed her soul to <lb/>
her Saviour; and from that moment earth was bright <lb/>
and heaven opened.</p>
<p>In 1852 Frances accompanied her father to <reg orig="Ger-|many">Germany</reg> <lb/>
to consult a celebrated oculist, on account of <lb/>
his being threatened with blindness. As it was <reg orig="need-|ful">needful</reg> <lb/>
to stay the winter, Frances was sent to a public <lb/>
school in D&uuml;sseldorf, which was attended by all the <lb/>
young ladies of the place. When the term was <reg orig="com-|pleted">completed</reg>, <lb/>
the examiners awarded high honours to <lb/>
Frances for the progress she had made in her studies. <lb/>
One of her teachers, who wrote relative to this period, <lb/>
said: "I instructed her in German composition, <reg orig="liter-|ature">literature</reg>, <lb/>
and history. I learned to appreciate her rich <lb/>
talents and mental powers, so that the lessons were <lb/>
more pleasure than work. She showed from the first <lb/>
such application, such rare talent, such depth of <reg orig="com-|prehension">comprehension</reg>, <lb/>
that I could only speak of her progress as <lb/>
extraordinary. She acquired such a knowledge of <lb/>
our most celebrated authors in a short time as even <lb/>
German ladies attain after much longer study. Those <lb/>
were precious moments when I unfolded to her the <lb/>
character of one of our noblest poets and thinkers, <lb/>
and let her have a glimpse into the splendour of his <lb/>
works. Stirred to the depths of her soul, she burst <lb/>
out enthusiastically, 'Oh, what mental giants, what <lb/>
gifted men these Germans are!' What imprinted the <lb/>
stamp of nobility upon her whole being, and influenced <lb/>
<pb n="271" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0278"/>
all her opinions, was her true piety and the deep <reg orig="rever-|ence">reverence</reg> <lb/>
she had for her Lord and Saviour, whose example <lb/>
penetrated her young life through and through."</p>
<p>In December 1853 Frances returned with her father <lb/>
to England, where she pursued her studies in <reg orig="Ger-|man">German</reg>, <lb/>
French, Hebrew, and English; and with the aid <lb/>
of her father, she obtained such a knowledge of Greek <lb/>
as enabled her to enjoy studying the Greek <reg orig="Testa-|ment">Testament</reg>. <lb/>
She wrote German and English poems, and <lb/>
poetical enigmas and charades, for which prizes were <lb/>
awarded. The money thus gained she sent to the <lb/>
Church Missionary Society. In 1856 she visited <reg orig="Ire-|land">Ireland</reg>. <lb/>
What she was then, and the influence she <lb/>
carried with her, is freshly told by an Irish <reg orig="school-|girl">schoolgirl</reg> <lb/>
who saw her at Celbridge Lodge. "Five o'clock <lb/>
was the hour appointed for the elder girls from the <lb/>
school to arrive at the lodge. Mrs. Shaw met us at <lb/>
the hall door with gentle words to each, and then <lb/>
brought us into the drawing-room, we being in a <lb/>
great state of delight at the thought of seeing 'the <lb/>
little English lady.' In a few seconds Miss Frances, <lb/>
carolling like a bird, flashed into the room. Flashed! <lb/>
yes, I say the word advisedly&mdash;flashed in like a burst <lb/>
of sunshine, like a hillside breeze, and stood before <lb/>
us, her fair sunny curls falling round her shoulders, <lb/>
her bright eyes dancing, and her fresh, sweet voice <lb/>
ringing through the room. I shall never forget that <lb/>
afternoon, never! I sat perfectly spellbound as she <lb/>
sang chant and hymn with marvellous sweetness, and <lb/>
<pb n="272" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0279"/>
then played two or three pieces of Handel, which <lb/>
thrilled me through and through. She finished with <lb/>
singing her father's tune &lpar;Hobah&rpar; to 'The Church of <lb/>
our Fathers.' As we walked home down the shady <lb/>
avenue, one and another said: 'Oh! isn't she lovely? <lb/>
and doesn't she sing like a born angel?'&mdash;'I love her, <lb/>
I do, and I'd follow her every step of the way back <lb/>
to England if I could.'&mdash;'Oh, she's a real Colleen <lb/>
Bawn!' Another of the class felt all the time that <lb/>
there must be the music of God's own love in that <lb/>
fair singer's heart. There was joy in her face, joy in <lb/>
her words, joy in her ways; and the secret cry went <lb/>
up from that young heart: 'Lord, teach me, even me, <lb/>
to know and love thee too.'"</p>
<p>Her father, owing to continued illness, resigned the <lb/>
living of St. Nicholas in 1860. Among the most <lb/>
prized parting gifts which Frances received was a <lb/>
remembrance-token from a class of what had been <lb/>
troublesome boys. They had yielded to loving words <lb/>
and gentle rules. One of the members of the class <lb/>
became a Scripture-reader, another a clergyman, and <lb/>
all brought forth good fruit in after-years. Frances <lb/>
delighted in the work of the Sunday school, keeping <lb/>
an account of each child's birthday, date of entrance <lb/>
into the school, any incident that had occurred in <lb/>
their home, general impressions of their character, <lb/>
and the subsequent events in their lives. She was <lb/>
not less loath to leave the many friends, both rich <lb/>
and poor, to whom she had become endeared; but <lb/>
<pb n="273" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0280"/>
the hope that her father's health would be improved <lb/>
by exchanging to the little country parish of <reg orig="Shares-|hill">Shareshill</reg>, <lb/>
reconciled her to the loss. Very lovingly Frances <lb/>
wrote: "Papa is so very much to me, so much more <lb/>
than all besides. He has been very ill again; and this <lb/>
puts an end to all ideas of farewell sermons or visits. <lb/>
It is wonderfully thrilling to see him in illness&mdash;such <lb/>
utter peacefulness, such grand conceptions of God's <lb/>
absolute sovereignty in everything, such quiet <reg orig="rejoic-|ing">rejoicing</reg> <lb/>
in his will, be it what it may, such shining trust <lb/>
in him, in and for everything, personal or parochial."</p>
<p>A year after her father removed to Shareshill, <lb/>
Frances was induced to undertake the education of <lb/>
her two nieces at Oakhampton, to whom she was <lb/>
tenderly attached. By this time she had composed <lb/>
the music to many songs, and was naturally <reg orig="de-|sirous">desirous</reg> <lb/>
for the opinion of a competent person as <lb/>
to her compositions. Having visited the Continent <lb/>
with her mother, she was induced, when at Cologne, <lb/>
to submit some of her compositions to Ferdinand <lb/>
Hiller, a very eminent musical authority. On <reg orig="look-|ing">looking</reg> <lb/>
them through, he asked Frances, "What <reg orig="instruc-|tion">instruction</reg> <lb/>
have you had?" She replied that her father <lb/>
had a knowledge of music, and that her first six <lb/>
songs had been corrected. "I do not care anything <lb/>
about that," said Hiller. "I mean what regular <lb/>
musical course have you gone through, and under <lb/>
what professor?" On being told that she had had <lb/>
no such instruction, he replied, "In that case I find <lb/>
<pb n="274" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0281"/>
this very remarkable." In delivering his opinion <lb/>
upon the merits of the compositions, he said that <lb/>
her works bore the stamp of talent, not of genius, <lb/>
and that "in the early works of great composers one <lb/>
comes across things that startle and strike you&mdash; <lb/>
ideas so utterly fresh and novel that you feel that <lb/>
there is great creative power. I do not find this in <lb/>
your melodies. They are not bad&mdash;on the contrary, <lb/>
I find them very pleasing, and many really very <lb/>
good; but they are thoroughly English in character <lb/>
and type. I do not consider that English melodies <lb/>
rank highest. But as for your harmonies, I must <lb/>
say I am astonished. It is something singular to <lb/>
find such grasp of the subject, such power of <reg orig="har-|monization">harmonization</reg>, <lb/>
except where there has been long and <lb/>
thorough study and instruction. Here I can give <lb/>
almost unlimited praise."</p>
<p>Frances had, in addition to her power of musical <lb/>
composition, a very sweet voice, which enabled her <lb/>
to become a valued solo singer. This power, and all <lb/>
her powers, she devoted to some good purpose and <lb/>
object. The proceeds of singing lessons which she <lb/>
gave she devoted to the Church Missionary Society, <lb/>
for which she had long been an earnest collector. <lb/>
The Jews, the Church Pastoral Aid, and the Bible <lb/>
Society, were alike helped and valued. Any and <lb/>
every association that was formed to make men <lb/>
better, to bring them to the feet of the Saviour, <lb/>
found in Frances a friend and helper.</p>
<pb n="275" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0282"/>
<p>Her home life, which was so soon to be disturbed, <lb/>
was happy and cheerful. Her father was her constant <lb/>
companion, with whom she delighted to converse <lb/>
upon classical, poetical, and musical matters. The <lb/>
moment she had completed a poem, she would rush <lb/>
away to his room to read it to him and hear his <lb/>
opinion; and then it would frequently happen that <lb/>
he would yield to her lively coaxing and "just sing" <lb/>
to her accompaniment. At other times he would <lb/>
improvise melodies and fugues, which had an <reg orig="absorb-|ing">absorbing</reg> <lb/>
interest for Frances. But this delightful <reg orig="inter-|change">interchange</reg> <lb/>
of affection was to have a speedy ending. <lb/>
On Easter eve, 1870, he felt more than usually well, <lb/>
and had enjoyed a walk in the afternoon. In the <lb/>
evening he sat down to the harmonium, playing and <lb/>
singing the tune he had composed in the morning. <lb/>
The next day he rose early as usual, but was seized <lb/>
with apoplexy, and after forty-eight hours of <reg orig="un-|consciousness">unconsciousness</reg>, <lb/>
passed away to the home for which <lb/>
his life had been a constant preparation, in his <lb/>
seventy-seventh year.</p>
<p>After her father's death, Frances, more earnestly, if <lb/>
that were possible, engaged in active work. Her <lb/>
many letters to her friends, in which she revealed <lb/>
and opened her heart, attest how lovingly she was <lb/>
attached to all real work. Her sister, speaking of <lb/>
her life at Oakhampton, says, "Her active service <lb/>
had no intervals of dreamy enjoyment; but cottage <lb/>
visitations, and four Bible classes weekly, attended <lb/>
<pb n="276" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0283"/>
with unwearied exertions, at last culminated in <lb/>
crowded attendances in the servants' hall. Then she <lb/>
was hard at work at a mission in Bewdley, and then <lb/>
at a mission in Liverpool, where she held young <lb/>
women's meetings, hymn meetings, and had converse <lb/>
with the many inquirers who sought her affectionate <lb/>
help. It will be declared only in the great day how <lb/>
many were incited to cast themselves upon the <lb/>
Saviour by her prayers and earnest entreaty. Upon <lb/>
one occasion she went for a visit of five days to a <lb/>
friend's house. The house contained ten persons. <lb/>
Frances prayed, 'Lord, give me <hi rend="italic">all</hi> in this house.' <lb/>
Before she left, <hi rend="italic">all</hi> could say, <hi rend="italic">My</hi> Father"!</p>
<p>The facility which Frances possessed in writing <lb/>
prose and poetry, and in musical composition, was <lb/>
used as a direct gift from God, and was heartily <lb/>
devoted to his service. Although she received <reg orig="con-|siderable">considerable</reg> <lb/>
sums of money from her publishers, and <lb/>
from the publishers of the various serials to which <lb/>
she contributed, no thought of the pay which might <lb/>
accrue from her writings ever intruded upon her <lb/>
work. All was done for the Master. And on one <lb/>
occasion when an American publisher failed, from <lb/>
whom she was expecting thirty-five pounds, she <lb/>
deemed the loss a direct blessing from the hand of <lb/>
her Father, who gave her the compensation of an <lb/>
increase of trust and peace. This was ever the happy <lb/>
condition to which Frances had attained&mdash;perfect <lb/>
trust. All was in her Father's hands, and all was well.</p>
<pb n="277" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0284"/>
<p>In 1874 Frances had an attack of typhoid fever, <lb/>
and was very near the gates of that heavenly home <lb/>
where her father had gone before. During all the <lb/>
days and nights of her illness it was a privilege to <lb/>
sit by her bedside, she was "so patient, so thankful, <lb/>
so considerate." Her heart was full of brightness; <lb/>
joy, and hope, and thankfulness beamed from her <lb/>
sweet face. As soon as she could be removed from <lb/>
her room,&mdash;her heavenly Father intending her to do <lb/>
more work for him before he called her away,&mdash;her <lb/>
hands were immediately employed upon needlework <lb/>
for the zenana missions. She could never be idle; she <lb/>
was always doing something for the Master. After <lb/>
more than three months' lingering illness, and in the <lb/>
hope that strength would come back, she was <reg orig="re-|moved">removed</reg> <lb/>
from Winterdyne to Oakhampton, the home <lb/>
of her elder sister. Before leaving, the servants <lb/>
gathered round her to say farewell. On parting <lb/>
from them, she said, "It was a great comfort in my <lb/>
illness the way in which you waited upon me. I <lb/>
saw you never grudged the trouble I gave;&mdash;<hi rend="italic">that</hi> <lb/>
would have distressed me. Remember, God's <reg orig="pro-|mises">promises</reg> <lb/>
are for each of you; faith is just holding out <lb/>
your hand and taking them. It is what I am <lb/>
learning every day&mdash;it makes me happy; and I <lb/>
want all of you to be always happy, trusting in the <lb/>
Lord Jesus."</p>
<p>Her recovery, however, was very slow,&mdash;eight <lb/>
months of illness, and four months of lingering <reg orig="con-|valescence">convalescence</reg>. <lb/>
<pb n="278" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0285"/>
But she found the year thus passed in <lb/>
suffering the most precious of her life. She said it <lb/>
was worth any suffering, to prove the truth of the <lb/>
promise&mdash;"When thou passest through the waters, I <lb/>
will be with thee;" and to be returned from the <lb/>
golden gates to "tell of His faithfulness&mdash;<hi rend="italic">it is so real</hi>."</p>
<p>Frances ever recognized the hand of her heavenly <lb/>
Father in all circumstances and conditions. Upon <lb/>
one occasion, having completed the appendix to <lb/>
"Songs of Grace and Glory," she came down from her <lb/>
study with a large roll for the post, exclaiming to <lb/>
her sister, with great glee, "There, it is all done; and <lb/>
now I am free to write a book!" In a few days the <lb/>
news was brought that a fire at the printer's had <lb/>
destroyed the stereotypes of her work, which was <lb/>
in course of being printed. The whole of Frances' <lb/>
winter's work was destroyed, not even a <reg orig="memoran-|dum">memorandum</reg> <lb/>
of a single tune was preserved; yet she could <lb/>
say, "It is so clearly 'Himself hath done it,' that I <lb/>
can only say, '<hi rend="italic">Thy</hi> way, not mine, O Lord!'" Then <lb/>
she went about the work afresh, praying that she <lb/>
might do it quite patiently, and have health to <reg orig="com-|plete">complete</reg> <lb/>
it.</p>
<p>Cheerfulness and bright heartiness characterized <lb/>
her whole work. During a visit to her brother <lb/>
Frank, at Upton-Bishop Vicarage, she immediately <lb/>
commenced to visit the schools and all the cottages, <lb/>
reading the Bible and speaking loving words of the <lb/>
Saviour's willingness to save all who come to him. <lb/>
<pb n="279" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0286"/>
At a garden-party at her brother's it was observed of <lb/>
Frances, by one who did not know her, that she <lb/>
"looks so really happy, she must have something we <lb/>
have not." Her sister wrote: "My pen fails in <lb/>
giving an idea of her sunny ways&mdash;merrily playing <lb/>
with children, and heartily enjoying all things. But <lb/>
her deep sympathy with others' joys and sorrows, <lb/>
and her loyal longings that all should know the 'joy <lb/>
unspeakable and full of glory,' were the secret of her <lb/>
influence." On the last Sunday evening that she <lb/>
spent with her brother at Upton-Bishop, she sang a <lb/>
portion of the "Messiah," accompanying herself on <lb/>
the organ, which caused that Sunday evening long to <lb/>
be remembered. Before her departure, she gave her <lb/>
brother the first contribution to a fund for the <reg orig="erec-|tion">erection</reg> <lb/>
of a new vestry; which, since her death, it has <lb/>
been resolved shall be in memory of Frances. Her <lb/>
brother, in loving remembrance of his sister, has had <lb/>
her name cast on a new treble bell, to complete the <lb/>
peal in the church tower.</p>
<p>One secret, if it may be called a secret, of the <lb/>
success which followed the efforts of Frances to <lb/>
spread the knowledge of the Saviour, was her <reg orig="readi-|ness">readiness</reg> <lb/>
at all times and in all places to speak a word <lb/>
for him. When with her sister visiting Switzerland, <lb/>
and staying for the Sunday at the great St. Bernard <lb/>
Hospice, Frances had been induced to play upon the <lb/>
piano, which so pleased the good fathers, that they <lb/>
entreated her after dinner to sing for the <reg orig="entertain-|ment">entertainment</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="280" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0287"/>
of the assembled strangers. Requesting her <lb/>
sister to pray that she might give the King's message <lb/>
in song, and that it might reach some hearts, she <lb/>
then, in German and Italian, said, gracefully and <lb/>
simply, that she was going to sing from the Holy <lb/>
Scriptures, and then sang Handel's "Comfort ye," <lb/>
"He shall feed his flock," and "Rest in the Lord." <lb/>
At the conclusion, the company flocked round with <lb/>
a profusion of thanks and expressions of admiration; <lb/>
then Frances bade them "Good-night," saying to <lb/>
her sister as she left the room, "You see, Marie, I <lb/>
gave my message, and so it is better to come away."</p>
<p>Many were the embraced opportunities during the <lb/>
tour for giving the "message." Strangers, invalids, <lb/>
tourists, remember her loving words, and speak of <lb/>
the delight experienced in her presence. One tourist <lb/>
wrote: "I feel sure that God led us to Champ&egrave;ry <lb/>
that we might see your dear sister Frances. Oh! I <lb/>
cannot tell what a blessing she was to me there. I <lb/>
always looked for those fair curls; and the saloon <lb/>
seemed desolate if I could not hear her voice and <lb/>
often merry laugh. She was so happy and <reg orig="whole-|hearted">wholehearted</reg>; <lb/>
and she spoke to me of the Lord Jesus, and of <lb/>
the joy of being altogether and <hi rend="italic">only</hi> his. Yes, it was <lb/>
on the balcony at Champ&egrave;ry that a new life and love <lb/>
seemed lighted up in my soul. Even as she was <lb/>
speaking to me I felt that, with God's grace, I must <lb/>
take the same step she had, and henceforth live 'only <lb/>
for Jesus.' That was indeed turning over a perfectly <lb/>
<pb n="281" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0288"/>
new and bright page in my life." And many such <lb/>
testimonies followed Frances, proving that in <reg orig="scatter-|ing">scattering</reg> <lb/>
the "message" the seed had not been lost.</p>
<p>During the Switzerland tour Frances had another <lb/>
serious illness, during which she manifested all her <lb/>
confiding patience; and on her return to England it <lb/>
was seen that she would never regain the strength <lb/>
she had previously enjoyed. And yet the work she <lb/>
performed was work for a strong man. Writing to <lb/>
a friend, she said:&mdash;"Your letter would take two <lb/>
hours to answer, and I have not ten minutes; fifteen <lb/>
to twenty letters to write every morning, proofs to <lb/>
correct, editors waiting for articles, poems and music <lb/>
I cannot touch, American publishers clamouring for <lb/>
poems or <hi rend="italic">any</hi> manuscripts, four Bible readings or <lb/>
classes weekly, many anxious ones waiting for help, <lb/>
a mission week coming, and other work after that. <lb/>
And my doctor says my <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italic">physique</hi></foreign> is too weak to <lb/>
balance the nerves and brain, and that I ought not <lb/>
to touch a pen."</p>
<p>After the death of her step-mother, Frances and <lb/>
her sister removed to Wales, where a cozy room, <lb/>
which she called her "work-shop," was fitted up for <lb/>
her special use. Her favourite chair had been <lb/>
brought from Astley Rectory. An American <reg orig="type-|writer">typewriter</reg> <lb/>
stood by the table. Her desk and table <lb/>
drawers were all methodically arranged for letters <lb/>
from editors, friends, relatives, strangers, matters of <lb/>
business, multitudinous requests, Irish Society work, <lb/>
<pb n="282" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0289"/>
manuscripts; paper and string in their allotted <lb/>
corners, and no litter ever allowed. Here at seven <lb/>
in the morning she commenced the work of the day <lb/>
by readings in the Bible, having always close at hand, <lb/>
for reference, the Hebrew Bible, Greek New <reg orig="Testa-|ment">Testament</reg>, <lb/>
and several lexicons. Her harp-piano was placed <lb/>
upon a stand of her own contriving; at which <reg orig="instru-|ment">instrument</reg> <lb/>
she composed her last song, "Loving all Along." <lb/>
All study and work was done in the early part of <lb/>
the day; early rising and early studying were her <lb/>
rule through life; while punctuality, and bright, quick, <lb/>
cheeriness, characterized all she did. Without this <lb/>
helpful spirit it would have been impossible to get <lb/>
through the labours which she undertook with so <lb/>
much heartiness. But surrounded as she was with <lb/>
work, and so earnestly and constantly labouring in <lb/>
her study, she yet found time to think upon and <reg orig="culti-|vate">cultivate</reg> <lb/>
the acquaintance of the neighbouring cottagers, <lb/>
for whom she commenced in her own home a "Bible <lb/>
reading." The cottagers always filled the room upon <lb/>
these occasions, and were thrillingly interested in <lb/>
the addresses which flowed, ardently and lovingly, <lb/>
from her lips. But these exercises, so joyous and <reg orig="ex-|hilarating">exhilarating</reg> <lb/>
to the spirit, exhausted the little strength <lb/>
which Frances could command.</p>
<p>In the last months of her life of service Frances <lb/>
saw the necessity of helping the great temperance <lb/>
movement. For the sake of others, in order that <lb/>
others might be induced to follow her example, she <lb/>
<pb n="283" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0290"/>
signed the temperance pledge, inducing six to sign <lb/>
the pledge with her. She could not, she said, "keep <lb/>
aloof from a movement on which God has set so <reg orig="evi-|dent">evident</reg> <lb/>
a seal of blessing;" adding, "I have gone in <reg orig="al-|together">altogether</reg> <lb/>
for it now, and find it gives me opportunities <lb/>
at once which I had not before."</p>
<p>But Frances' bright, beautiful life was coming to <lb/>
an end; and the end was no doubt hastened by a <lb/>
last effort to spread the "message" which was to <lb/>
her so dear. On the 21st May 1879, according to <lb/>
her promise, she had gone out, although the day was <lb/>
very damp, to meet some men and boys on the <reg orig="vil-|lage">village</reg> <lb/>
bank, taking her Bible and temperance <reg orig="pledge-|book">pledge-book</reg> <lb/>
with her. She stood for a long time on the <lb/>
cold grass, and returned home wet and chilly. On <lb/>
the next day, after partaking of the sacrament in <lb/>
the church, she was very tired and took a donkey <lb/>
home. As she passed along, numbers of boys ran <lb/>
around her to catch her smile and to hear her <reg orig="pleas-|ant">pleasant</reg>, <lb/>
encouraging words. The little fellow who <lb/>
drove the donkey remembers that Miss Frances told <lb/>
him: "I had better leave the devil's side and get on <lb/>
the safe side; that Jesus Christ's was the winning <lb/>
side; that he loved us and was calling us, and <lb/>
wouldn't I choose him for my Captain?" She <reg orig="in-|duced">induced</reg> <lb/>
him to sign the pledge, the book resting on <lb/>
the saddle. Then in the evening she went to the <lb/>
home of a young sailor who was going to sea, and <lb/>
got him to sign the pledge, and then gave her last <lb/>
<pb n="284" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0291"/>
"message" out of her own home. But when she <reg orig="re-|turned">returned</reg> <lb/>
home, and before retiring, she spoke earnest <lb/>
words to several people assembled in the kitchen. <lb/>
The few days that intervened before "going home," <lb/>
she spent in much pain and suffering; but she was <lb/>
joyous and trustful. Not a cloud came between her <lb/>
and the glorious presence of her Saviour. And when <lb/>
told that only a short time would transpire before <lb/>
the end came, she said, "Too good to be true!" Then <lb/>
sweetly smiling, she uttered the words, "Splendid to <lb/>
be so near the gates of heaven! So beautiful to go!" <lb/>
When the end had come, she clearly but faintly sang <lb/>
to her own tune "Hermas:"&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="stanza">
<l>"Jesus, I will trust thee,</l>
<l rend="indent">Trust thee with my soul;</l>
<l>Guilty, lost, and helpless,</l>
<l rend="indent">Thou hast made me whole:</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>"There is none in heaven,</l>
<l rend="indent">Or on earth, like thee;</l>
<l>Thou hast died for sinners,</l>
<l rend="indent">Therefore, Lord, for <hi rend="italic">me</hi>."</l>
</lg></q>
Then the nurse gently assisting her, after a rush of <lb/>
convulsive sickness, she nestled down in the pillows, <lb/>
folding her hands on her breast, and said, "There, <lb/>
now, it is all over. Blessed rest!" For a few <lb/>
minutes before her departure her face was lit with <lb/>
wondrous radiance, as if she were already gazing upon <lb/>
her Saviour, and had reached the home of the <lb/>
blessed. After uttering one word, in an attempt to <lb/>
sing, anxious to join the choir above with a song of <lb/>
<pb n="285" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0292"/>
praise upon her lips, her spirit took its flight to join <lb/>
in songs of praise that shall never end. Thus closed <lb/>
a dear, beautiful life, spent in the service of the <lb/>
Saviour. And although her life was ended at a <lb/>
very early age, having only attained her forty-second <lb/>
year, she included in her life the work of many <lb/>
lives, and was the means, in the hands of her <lb/>
Saviour, of drawing many to him as the only source <lb/>
of true joy in this life and of hope for the life to come.</p>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"She had toiled in the blessed vineyard,</l>
<l rend="indent">And as she toiled she sang,</l>
<l>Till far through the sunny distance</l>
<l rend="indent">That sweetest music rang;</l>
<l>And her fellow-workers, far and near,</l>
<l>Gave thanks to God for her words of cheer."</l>

<pb n="287" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0294"/>
It will never be known, in this world at <lb/>
least, the good that resulted from the efforts and <lb/>
labours of Mrs. Tait. She not only did good herself, <lb/>
but inspired good in others. She exemplified in her <lb/>
own life the peace and happiness which flow into <lb/>
the heart when Christ has become all in all; and <lb/>
showed in the activities of her life that true religion <lb/>
is something more than faith and repose, that it must <lb/>
give evidence of its existence by deeds of loving help <lb/>
and service&mdash;"visiting the fatherless and the widow," <lb/>
in addition to keeping "unspotted from the world." <lb/>
This Mrs. Tait did, if ever human being obeyed the <lb/>
call of the Master, and "went about doing good."</p>
<p>Catharine Tait was the daughter of Archdeacon <lb/>
Spooner, and was born at Elmdon Parsonage on the <lb/>
9th of December 1819. Her childhood is described <lb/>
by those who knew her in loving and endeared <lb/>
words: they speak of her as a bright, cheerful, <reg orig="in-|telligent">intelligent</reg> <lb/>
child, the delight of all who saw her; and <lb/>
that all who saw her loved her. And when she <lb/>
bloomed into girlhood, one wrote of her, when she <lb/>
was seventeen, that she was "an exceedingly lovely <lb/>
girl, the sunshine and joy of the whole household, <lb/>
full of mirth, elasticity, and buoyancy of spirits." <lb/>
But even at that tender age, when duties are so often <lb/>
forgotten in the whirl of youthful spirits and in the <lb/>
pursuit of pleasure, Catharine was remarkable for <lb/>
earnestness, conscientiousness, and thoughtfulness. <lb/>
At that early period duty had become her law. No <lb/>
<pb n="288" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0295"/>
moments were wasted, and every hour was employed <lb/>
She had her regular visits to the old and sick poor <lb/>
attended both the Sunday and the week-day school, <lb/>
as well as sedulously instructed the younger servants <lb/>
in her father's home. Her first care in the morning <lb/>
was to visit her mother's room, and read to her, <reg orig="be-|fore">before</reg> <lb/>
she left her bed, a portion of Scripture; and <lb/>
then, when walking with her father, she would <reg orig="re-|cite">recite</reg> <lb/>
prose and poetry that she had previously <reg orig="com-|mitted">committed</reg> <lb/>
to memory, to amuse and interest him. Her <lb/>
constant practice was to rise very early in the <reg orig="morn-|ing">morning</reg>, <lb/>
both winter and summer, to read and study <reg orig="his-|tory">history</reg> <lb/>
and the works of the old English divines. Her <lb/>
brother-in-law, Edward Fortescue, who had imbibed <lb/>
the teaching of Newman and the spirit as well as the <lb/>
letter of the Oxford Tracts, exercised a considerable <lb/>
influence upon Catharine. This influence was felt <lb/>
through life, but happily it was so modified that the <lb/>
strictest Puritan would have had difficulty in pointing <lb/>
to any specially developed High Churchism in her <lb/>
long and useful life.</p>
<p>At this interesting period of her life, the Bishop of <lb/>
Gibraltar, then a young man under his father's roof, <lb/>
says, "She won the heart of every one at Dunchurch. <lb/>
Her lightest wish was law to my brothers and <reg orig="my-|self">myself</reg>. <lb/>
Nothing would we not have done to win a <lb/>
smile from her or a kindly word." It was no wonder <lb/>
that the newly-appointed head-master of Rugby <lb/>
School, Dr. Tait, found it agreeable to gallop over to <lb/>
<pb n="289" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0296"/>
Dunchurch to spend the evening with a family that <lb/>
contained within its circle so interesting a girl. One <lb/>
evening, when reading aloud her cousin Wilberforce's <lb/>
"Agathos," she made a false quantity in <reg orig="pronounc-|ing">pronouncing</reg> <lb/>
the Greek word <foreign lang="rom"><hi rend="italic">agape</hi></foreign> &lpar;love&rpar;, which Dr. Tait <lb/>
pleasantly corrected; and he subsequently taught her <lb/>
the true meaning of the word by inspiring her with <lb/>
affection for himself, which he had, no doubt, felt <lb/>
for her from his first introduction. Archdeacon <lb/>
Sanderson, in congratulating the head-master, said <lb/>
that "he was glad to find he had taught Catharine <lb/>
the right way to pronounce <foreign lang="rom"><hi rend="italic">agap&emacr;</hi></foreign>." The archbishop <lb/>
himself tells a pleasant story of those early days: <lb/>
"We had met in Worcestershire some six or seven <lb/>
years before. Her uncle, Mr. Gerard Noel, had then <lb/>
jokingly said to her at Hallow Park, 'I suppose you <lb/>
are making these slippers for Mr. Tait.'" A curious <lb/>
anticipation, as neither she nor Mr. Tait had any <lb/>
thoughts of each other; they had only met casually, <lb/>
and did not meet again for many years. When the <lb/>
good uncle was sent for in the summer of 1843 to <lb/>
marry them at Elmdon, he quietly remarked, "So, <lb/>
Kitty, you were, after all, making those slippers for <lb/>
Mr. Tait." Very heartily did he give his sanction to <lb/>
the fulfilment of his prophecy. It is pleasant to <reg orig="re-|cord">record</reg> <lb/>
that on the morning of her wedding day she <lb/>
went to her mother's bedroom to read a portion of <lb/>
Scripture as usual.</p>
<p>After the marriage tour through Derbyshire and the <lb/>
<pb n="290" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0297"/>
Lowlands and Highlands of Scotland, Catharine with <lb/>
her husband entered upon the many duties of the <lb/>
Rugby School. The life which had now to be led, with <lb/>
its bustle, cares, and responsibilities, so opposite to the <lb/>
quiet home life from which she had come, might <lb/>
well have alarmed the young wife, who then, for <lb/>
the first time, entered upon such duties. But this <lb/>
was not so. She quietly, says her husband, entered <lb/>
upon her work. "You could scarcely dream of a <lb/>
brighter, happier, busier life, and she threw herself <lb/>
into it with full enjoyment." But many and <reg orig="ab-|sorbing">absorbing</reg> <lb/>
though the duties of the school were, Mrs. <lb/>
Tait found time to make the acquaintance of all the <lb/>
poor of the town, and to establish a little school for <lb/>
girls, in which it was her pleasure to teach almost <lb/>
every day. She certainly understood the advantage <lb/>
of order and regularity, else it would have been <reg orig="im-|possible">impossible</reg> <lb/>
to get through the amount of work she <lb/>
daily accomplished. Soon after seven in the <reg orig="morn-|ing">morning</reg> <lb/>
she would leave her room to go to the parish <lb/>
church to hear and join in the prayers; then, after <lb/>
spending a little time in her own room, she would <lb/>
join the household at the family prayers. At a <lb/>
quarter past ten she would be in the midst of her <lb/>
household work. On certain days she received the <lb/>
poor people of the town, and made notes of their <lb/>
several requirements. When possible, she would <lb/>
join the friends staying with her and read and <reg orig="con-|verse">converse</reg>; <lb/>
and when opportunity offered, take a lesson <lb/>
<pb n="291" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0298"/>
in German. The afternoons of the holidays she <reg orig="re-|served">reserved</reg> <lb/>
for the society and pleasure of her husband. <lb/>
Any intervals in the day's duties were devoted to <lb/>
visits to the poor or any needed useful work. In <lb/>
the evening she, with her husband, had the company <lb/>
of some of the boys in the school, in order to <reg orig="en-|courage">encourage</reg> <lb/>
a kindly home feeling. Reading before and <lb/>
after family prayers would close the day, which <reg orig="in-|variably">invariably</reg> <lb/>
ended at midnight. The boys of the school <lb/>
almost worshipped the young wife; they had a <reg orig="chival-|rous">chivalrous</reg>, <lb/>
romantic admiration for her youth and beauty, <lb/>
joined to a grateful sense of kindliness and manifold <lb/>
acts of sympathy and affection which she had at <lb/>
times so cheerfully bestowed upon them. Amid all <lb/>
these cares and absorbing employments, she found <lb/>
time and inclination to keep her husband's <reg orig="com-|plicated">complicated</reg> <lb/>
accounts in such admirable order as to <lb/>
astonish professional accountants. "She carried her <lb/>
Christian principle," said her husband, "into all she <lb/>
had to do, and did it heartily and regularly, as to the <lb/>
Lord."</p>
<p>In 1849, Dr. Tait was appointed Dean of Carlisle, <lb/>
whither in that year, much to the regret of the <lb/>
Rugby boys, the family removed. The doctor had <lb/>
been subjected to a very severe illness, from which it <lb/>
had not been expected that he would recover: it <lb/>
was hoped that the comparative rest and quiet of <lb/>
the deanery would help to his complete restoration. <lb/>
But for a woman of Mrs. Tait's disposition and <lb/>
<pb n="292" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0299"/>
habits, there could be no rest in the sense of ceasing <lb/>
to work. Very speedily the poor of Carlisle <reg orig="dis-|covered">discovered</reg> <lb/>
a friend in the dean's wife. They came to <lb/>
her at the deanery house, and told her their troubles <lb/>
and wants; and she as regularly visited them in <lb/>
their homes, and helped them in their needs. By <lb/>
teaching in the school she was enabled to make the <lb/>
acquaintance of many young people, and through <lb/>
them their parents. As there was no appointed <lb/>
chaplain at the workhouse, Mrs. Tait visited it <lb/>
regularly to read and talk with the afflicted poor <lb/>
people. She exercised not less consideration for her <lb/>
friends and neighbours, whom she greatly enjoyed <lb/>
gathering around her in the deanery, and who would <lb/>
never forget the bright, cheerful hours spent in her <lb/>
company.</p>
<p>But the brightest and most joyous hours spent in <lb/>
the deanery by Mrs. Tait were spent with her dear <lb/>
children&mdash;five sweet girls and a charming boy. The <lb/>
mother has recorded scenes with her little ones of <lb/>
surpassing interest&mdash;how she loved them, and how <lb/>
sweetly that love was returned. If ever mother <lb/>
was gladdened with the budding promise of children, <lb/>
that mother was Mrs. Tait. But presently she was <lb/>
called to pass through trials which, thank God, few <lb/>
mothers are called to bear. One after another, <lb/>
within the space of a few days, five of her charming <lb/>
children were taken away. Graphically and minutely <lb/>
has the dear mother described the departure of her <lb/>
<pb n="293" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0300"/>
little girls. Had it not been for the consolations of <lb/>
religion&mdash;for the certain hope, deeply embedded in her <lb/>
heart, that the little ones had only "gone before," <lb/>
and that ere long she would rejoin them&mdash;reason <lb/>
must have left its seat. But strength was given her <lb/>
to bear the terrible trial, and even at the last <lb/>
moment not to permit her overwrought feelings to <lb/>
overcome her sense of duty. On returning from the <lb/>
grave where the last little one had been laid, it <lb/>
having been arranged that they should immediately <lb/>
leave Carlisle, and knowing that she must be some <lb/>
time absent, if she ever returned, she arranged the <lb/>
accounts of the Mothers' Club, of which she had the <lb/>
management, placing every one's money with the <lb/>
little account to the proper name, so that there might <lb/>
be no mistake, inconvenience, or loss in her absence. <lb/>
Then she was ready to take her departure with her <lb/>
infant, now two months old, and her husband. <lb/>
"Everything she accepted as coming straight from <lb/>
God; and every act, great or small, was simply, as <lb/>
she used to say with a smile, <hi rend="italic">part of the day's</hi> <lb/>
work."</p>
<p>The dean tells us that with his wife and little girl <lb/>
he fled to the hills at Moffat, and then to the <lb/>
banks of Windermere, and then for a more <reg orig="length-|ened">lengthened</reg> <lb/>
residence by the picturesque lake of Ulleswater. <lb/>
They had a dread of returning to the Carlisle <reg orig="dean-|ery">deanery</reg>, <lb/>
and were therefore much relieved when the <lb/>
see of London was offered to the dean, owing to the <lb/>
<pb n="294" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0301"/>
sympathy which the Queen felt for the great <reg orig="de-|privation">deprivation</reg> <lb/>
he and his wife had sustained. But this <lb/>
deprivation was not allowed to interfere with the <lb/>
duties of the new position. Mrs. Tait entered upon <lb/>
her new life with fresh hopes and anticipations of <lb/>
usefulness. Of the seven hundred candidates <reg orig="or-|dained">ordained</reg> <lb/>
by her husband, few of them but remember <lb/>
some kindness of Mrs. Tait; and despite the clergy <lb/>
connected with the see numbered about one <reg orig="thou-|sand">thousand</reg>, <lb/>
she did what she could to make their personal <lb/>
acquaintance. In no year, during the occupancy of <lb/>
the see by her husband, did she fail to receive all <lb/>
the clergy in London as her guests. For several <lb/>
Saturdays in each summer she welcomed her many <lb/>
friends to garden parties at Fulham; and although <lb/>
grave clergymen, statesmen, and literary men met at <lb/>
these open-air gatherings, there were never wanting <lb/>
a large concourse of joyous children, for whose <reg orig="amuse-|ment">amusement</reg> <lb/>
two or three old ponies were trotted out.</p>
<p>But the poor had not less of her time and <reg orig="atten-|tion">attention</reg>, <lb/>
to whom her visits were untiring, and in whose <lb/>
families she took a personal interest. Weekly she <lb/>
spent a portion of her time reading to the old people <lb/>
in the Fulham and Hammersmith Workhouse, and in <lb/>
the Fulham Refuge. The almshouses were specially <lb/>
cared for. Very early she taught her children <reg orig="rev-|erence">reverence</reg> <lb/>
and loving care for the aged; teaching them <lb/>
to read and sing to the old people. One afternoon <lb/>
in each week was devoted to this duty, pleasantly <lb/>
<pb n="295" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0302"/>
and cheerfully rendered by the dear children. There <lb/>
were few poor cottages at Fulham where Mrs. Tait <lb/>
was not constantly to be seen; and as her <reg orig="know-|ledge">knowledge</reg> <lb/>
of London increased, she was not less <reg orig="fre-|quently">frequently</reg> <lb/>
to be met with in the large hospitals, and <lb/>
especially in those hospitals which presented <reg orig="oppor-|tunities">opportunities</reg> <lb/>
for usefulness best suited for a woman. <lb/>
Her husband says:&mdash;"The Brompton Consumptive <lb/>
Hospital lay half-way between Fulham and London <lb/>
House, and many poor patients have carried to their <lb/>
dying day a grateful remembrance of the regular <lb/>
Scripture lesson which week after week she gave <lb/>
there. Meanwhile, penitentiaries, conducted by <lb/>
sisterhoods, were growing. She took an interest <lb/>
in them all, especially in St. James's Home, which she <lb/>
was chiefly instrumental in having erected on a <reg orig="por-|tion">portion</reg> <lb/>
of the estate at Fulham. The ladies at the head <lb/>
of these institutions became her friends; and so many <lb/>
were the centres of such work in which, as time <lb/>
went on, she became interested, that I remember we <lb/>
used to have a joke, that one day when she said to <lb/>
the footman at the carriage door, 'Home,' he <reg orig="an-|swered">answered</reg>, <lb/>
'Which home, ma'am?'" But numerous as <lb/>
were her engagements and occupations, her <reg orig="admir-|able">admirable</reg> <lb/>
system enabled her not to undertake any work <lb/>
that she was not able effectually to fulfil.</p>
<p>One night Mrs. Tait awakened her husband to <lb/>
tell him of a scheme that was impressed upon her <lb/>
mind, for the formation of a Ladies' Diocesan <reg orig="Asso-|ciation">Association</reg>, <lb/>
<pb n="296" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0303"/>
which she lost no time in creating. Her <lb/>
idea was, that the great number of ladies in London <lb/>
anxious to be employed in Christian work, would do <lb/>
the work more effectually if banded together in a <lb/>
society. It was also felt that more doors for <reg orig="useful-|ness">usefulness</reg> <lb/>
would be opened to the members of a society <lb/>
that had the bishop at its head. It was proposed <lb/>
that the work of the society should include three <lb/>
objects:&mdash;1. The spiritual benefit of the workers, <lb/>
by giving some definite work to those anxious to <lb/>
strengthen their own inner life by consecrated <reg orig="ser-|vice">service</reg>. <lb/>
2. The comfort and edification of the sick, <lb/>
suffering, and lonely. 3. The encouragement of <lb/>
co-operation in good works and almsgiving. The <lb/>
committees and heads of hospitals, penitentiaries, <lb/>
houses of charity, and the clerks of boards of <lb/>
guardians were solicited to allow the ladies of the <lb/>
association to visit their several institutions. The <lb/>
appeal to the ladies to aid and help the movement <lb/>
met with a very hearty and general response. Many <lb/>
ladies of rank and influence, during the London <lb/>
season, regularly devoted a portion of each week to <lb/>
visiting some of the poor people in the hospitals, <lb/>
the workhouses, and the wretched dwellings which <lb/>
abound in London. The help that was given was <lb/>
not merely good words and much-needed advice, but <lb/>
in not less required material form, which was <reg orig="cheer-|fully">cheerfully</reg> <lb/>
contributed in the West End. The lady <lb/>
workers were gathered together by Mrs. Tait in her <lb/>
<pb n="297" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0304"/>
own home once a week, to take part in a religious <lb/>
service, and thus become strengthened for the work <lb/>
in which they were engaged. Mrs. Tait visited each <lb/>
post of labour at stated periods, to encourage the <lb/>
workers, and to give them the benefit of her <reg orig="ex-|perience">experience</reg>. <lb/>
Anxious that her daughters should early <lb/>
enter upon charitable, Christian work, and become <lb/>
acquainted with the duties and necessities of such <lb/>
work, she had assigned to them the Ophthalmic <lb/>
Hospital and St. Martin's Workhouse, to be regularly <lb/>
visited by them in the company of a grown-up friend.</p>
<p>A letter from one who had been a member of the <lb/>
association, gives a glimpse of the value of the labour <lb/>
to those engaged in it:&mdash;"Years ago, when I was a <lb/>
Londoner and joined the band of workers of which <lb/>
Mrs. Tait was the soul and spirit, sorrow came upon <lb/>
me, and I went down to Fulham to say farewell and <lb/>
ask advice. Mrs. Tait took me up to her room, and <lb/>
poured out her soul in intercessory prayer for my <lb/>
case; and often since, when mercies have surrounded <lb/>
me in my home here, I have thought that that prayer <lb/>
brought my blessings." Another correspondent <lb/>
wrote:&mdash;"I went to Mrs. Tait under great distress <lb/>
of mind, and her wonderful kindness in listening to <lb/>
me, a complete stranger, her practical and experienced <lb/>
view of my difficulties, are all present to me at this <lb/>
moment. Her kind words fell upon a very sad <lb/>
heart."</p>
<p>London had a severe visitation of cholera in <lb/>
<pb n="298" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0305"/>
1866, during which Mrs. Tait, with her husband, <lb/>
visited the infected districts. She did this to <reg orig="en-|courage">encourage</reg> <lb/>
others to visit those who were stricken with <lb/>
the dreaded infection. "She knew," as the bishop <lb/>
said, "that her voluntary presence in the hospitals <lb/>
would give courage and endurance to those who <lb/>
could not escape from the responsibility of <reg orig="minister-|ing">ministering</reg> <lb/>
to the sick; and that personal knowledge of the <lb/>
danger and its details would enable both her and <lb/>
me better to appeal for help and assist in the <reg orig="organ-|ization">organization</reg> <lb/>
of efficient remedies." She might have been <lb/>
seen at the bedsides of the cholera patients, soothing <lb/>
and helping them&mdash;in the Wapping Hospital, in the <lb/>
Shoreditch Hospital, and in the Middlesex Hospital; <lb/>
and then, subsequently, when the plague began to <lb/>
abate, she was to be found aiding, by her labours <lb/>
and advice, in the temporary convalescent building <lb/>
erected near the Thames. Many of those who had <lb/>
fallen victims to the cholera left orphan children. <lb/>
To provide homes for these little ones was the source <lb/>
of much anxiety to Mrs. Tait. Mrs. Gladstone, Miss <lb/>
Marsh, and herself, with their characteristic energy <lb/>
and ability, resolved to provide them with permanent <lb/>
homes until they were able to take care of <reg orig="them-|selves">themselves</reg>. <lb/>
Mrs. Gladstone undertook to provide a home <lb/>
for the boys; and Mrs. Tait hired a house at Fulham <lb/>
for the girls, which ultimately became developed in <lb/>
the Fulham Orphanage, which contained about thirty <lb/>
girls, and which she visited almost every day. On <lb/>
<pb n="299" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0306"/>
the Sundays the little people visited her at her own <lb/>
home, when she would read to them the "Pilgrim's <lb/>
Progress," or some other book. When Dr. Tait was <lb/>
in 1869 translated from London to Canterbury, Mrs. <lb/>
Tait caused an orphanage to be built on the Isle of <lb/>
Thanet with accommodation for eighty children; <lb/>
and soon after she added a convalescent home for the <lb/>
reception of women and children in need of sea air, <lb/>
which she constantly visited. Her great care was to <lb/>
have the girls properly trained in domestic work, <lb/>
and to keep a watchful eye upon them when they <lb/>
entered "service." They were encouraged to keep <lb/>
up a correspondence with Mrs. Tait and her daughters, <lb/>
as well as the ladies who assisted in the orphanage.</p>
<p>Mrs. Tait originated an admirable plan for securing <lb/>
an oversight of the girls. In a report printed in <lb/>
1877 she explained her plan: "In respect to orphans, <lb/>
Mrs. Tait is desirous to continue the system which <lb/>
has been successfully adopted since the <reg orig="commence-|ment">commencement</reg> <lb/>
of the institution, under which ladies or <reg orig="chil-|dren">children</reg> <lb/>
of the higher classes undertake to watch over <lb/>
and care for individual orphans, and during the <lb/>
child's residence at the Home to provide or raise a <lb/>
a sum of &pound;12 to &pound;15 a year for her maintenance. <lb/>
Such assistants to be termed Children's Associates: <lb/>
an associate to undertake, by personal interview or <lb/>
by correspondence, to become acquainted with the <lb/>
orphan, to be interested in her during her residence <lb/>
at the Home, and to endeavour to watch over and <lb/>
<pb n="300" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0307"/>
befriend her, if occasion require it, in after-life; so <lb/>
that each child may feel that she has a friend and <lb/>
adviser interested in her future prospects, and <reg orig="tak-|ing">taking</reg>, <lb/>
in some degree, the place of the parent she has <lb/>
lost. Mrs. Tait will be very thankful to any ladies, <lb/>
or their children, who will come forward and help in <lb/>
this way, and who will apply for orphans to be <lb/>
assigned to them." This admirable scheme was <lb/>
liberally responded to, and many girls were thus <lb/>
saved from the isolation and absence of sympathy <lb/>
which otherwise would have been experienced.</p>
<p>When Dr. Tait was removed to Lambeth and <lb/>
became Archbishop of Canterbury, the new field of <lb/>
labour presented new and greater opportunities for <lb/>
Mrs. Tait's work. Scarcely any but poor people <reg orig="re-|sided">resided</reg> <lb/>
at Lambeth. Every week visits were regularly <lb/>
paid to their homes; and on each Sunday the <reg orig="Lam-|beth">Lambeth</reg> <lb/>
Workhouse was visited. One poor fellow, who <lb/>
had been confined in the hospital, wrote, after Mrs. <lb/>
Tait's death, "I never can think of the twelfth of <lb/>
Hebrews without the voice of Mrs. Tait coming back <lb/>
to me reading it so solemnly by my bedside in <reg orig="hos-|pital">hospital</reg> <lb/>
years ago. I can never forget it." But not <lb/>
only in kind words and personal service was Mrs. <lb/>
Tait mindful of the poor. The large garden attached <lb/>
to the archbishop's residence, which became her <lb/>
special care, furnished her with the opportunity <lb/>
of sending gifts of vegetables, etc., to those who <lb/>
needed them. Preparing and sending away these <lb/>
<pb n="301" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0308"/>
gift-hampers always afforded her much pleasure. <lb/>
The large hampers of useful vegetables were sent to <lb/>
the poor people who had large families, and anything <lb/>
specially choice to the sick&mdash;flowers always, if <reg orig="pos-|sible">possible</reg>, <lb/>
accompanying the hampers; and if there were <lb/>
none available in her own garden, she would give the <lb/>
school-children a few pence to gather primroses, <lb/>
violets, and wild hyacinths. The poor people in the <lb/>
cottages were permitted to gather sticks in the park <lb/>
for firewood. Mrs. Tait had personal charge of the <lb/>
poultry, helped by one assistant. At the end of the <lb/>
year the profits were divided between the manager <lb/>
and her charities. Her daughters bought pigs, which <lb/>
they fed: when sold, the profits were part of their <lb/>
contributions to the Orphanage. It was the constant <lb/>
custom, at the end of the London season, for Mrs. <lb/>
Tait to have a gathering of her poor neighbours for <lb/>
a garden-party. Many of them treasure recollections <lb/>
of her stories and pleasant words, and of the hearty <lb/>
manner in which she led the hymns before the party <lb/>
dispersed. That was Mrs. Tait's life and influence <lb/>
among the poor of Lambeth.</p>
<p>The archbishop, describing Mrs. Tait's occupation <lb/>
for the first six years at Lambeth, says, "My dear <lb/>
wife's occupations, domestic, social, and charitable, <lb/>
were much the same as they had been in the diocese <lb/>
of London. According to the grace given to her, she <lb/>
did her work as to the Lord, without any <reg orig="ostenta-|tion;&mdash;giving">ostentation;&mdash;giving</reg> <lb/>
of her abundance with cheerfulness; <lb/>
<pb n="302" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0309"/>
ruling her house with diligence; charitable and <lb/>
cheerful; abhorring that which is evil; cleaving to <lb/>
that which is good; kindly affectioned in sisterly <lb/>
love; preferring others to herself; not slothful in <lb/>
business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord; <reg orig="re-|joicing">rejoicing</reg> <lb/>
in hope; patient in all trials; continuing <reg orig="in-|stant">instant</reg> <lb/>
in prayer; distributing to the necessities of <lb/>
those in need; given to hospitality; blessing by her <lb/>
gracious words and demeanour; rejoicing with them <lb/>
that rejoiced, and weeping with them that wept; not <lb/>
minding high things; accessible and kind to those of <lb/>
low estate; never recompensing evil for evil; <reg orig="provid-|ing">providing</reg> <lb/>
things honest in the sight of all men."</p>
<p>One of her friends said: "Nothing was more <reg orig="char-|acteristic">characteristic</reg> <lb/>
of her than her way of spending Sunday. <lb/>
When you met her in the early morning, her very <lb/>
face seemed to tell you it was her day of days. Hers <lb/>
was not merely the negative observance of the day, in <lb/>
the spirit of the Jewish Sabbath, 'Not doing thine <lb/>
own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor <reg orig="speak-|ing">speaking</reg> <lb/>
thine own words.' Rather it was the natural <lb/>
outcome and complement of her week-day life&mdash;the <lb/>
under-current of her daily life welling to a higher <lb/>
level and allowed freer course by hindrances being <lb/>
put aside for a time. There was full measure of <reg orig="out-|ward">outward</reg> <lb/>
observance, of services and sacraments, and <lb/>
'church-blest things;' but it was all according to <lb/>
the 'perfect law of liberty,' and without a particle of <lb/>
strictness. She honestly tried to give up the day, <lb/>
<pb n="303" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0310"/>
whole and entire, to God and his special service, or <lb/>
to the service of his poor and suffering creatures, in <lb/>
some form or other, but without giving place either <lb/>
to superstition or scrupulosity, and without judging <lb/>
others or expecting them to do what she thought <lb/>
right to do. None but those who have been <reg orig="privi-|leged">privileged</reg> <lb/>
to share one of those Sundays can realize the <lb/>
atmosphere of home affection and divine love that <lb/>
pervaded them; for the secret charm of her life and <lb/>
character was her perfect simplicity and <reg orig="straightfor-|wardness">straightforwardness</reg> <lb/>
in just trying, with God's help, from <lb/>
moment to moment 'to do her duty in that state of <lb/>
life to which he had called her.' Her nature was not <lb/>
to be striking or original; evenness and thorough <lb/>
Christian simplicity were its characteristics. Each <lb/>
new duty, each new position, she undertook with <lb/>
diffidence and misgiving, indeed, but with a sure <reg orig="re-|liance">reliance</reg> <lb/>
on help which never failed her. This simple, <lb/>
straightforward, self-regardless way of taking things <lb/>
as she found them, might have caused, perhaps, in <lb/>
lapse of time, some degree of apathy or hardness in <lb/>
her disposition, had it not been for her natural <reg orig="over-|flow">overflow</reg> <lb/>
of sympathy, deepened by the grace of God. In <lb/>
her brightest, merriest moments, the slightest hint or <lb/>
indication of another's sorrow or suffering would <reg orig="in-|stantly">instantly</reg> <lb/>
change her look, and voice, and manner, and <lb/>
bring to bear the succour of a most subtile-paced <lb/>
counsel in distress, winning its way with extreme <lb/>
gentleness."</p>
<pb n="304" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0311"/>
<p>Mrs. Tait's personal interest in the life of each <lb/>
child in the orphanage was most remarkable. She <lb/>
ever entertained towards them love and individual <lb/>
interest. She never forgot a child; and as her <reg orig="vari-|ous">various</reg> <lb/>
claims and duties caused often long absence from <lb/>
any personal intercourse, this was the more surprising. <lb/>
Nor was this all: she not only knew each child, and <lb/>
recollected all about them&mdash;their character, their <lb/>
position in the Orphanage&mdash;but she also remembered <lb/>
who they were, where they came from, and who were <lb/>
their friends and relatives, and the home incidents <lb/>
connected with each child. Many a rough girl was <lb/>
softened and subdued by her inquiring with tender <lb/>
sympathy after her relatives at home. She had <reg orig="im-|plicit">implicit</reg> <lb/>
faith in effort and endeavour, and would never <lb/>
give any one up, however bad she might be. Any <lb/>
special development of passion or evil she would look <lb/>
upon as a passing cloud, which must be patiently <lb/>
allowed to pass, to "tide over," as she would say, and <lb/>
all would be well. One of her friends wrote: "She <lb/>
was a perfect exemplification of the law of charity, <lb/>
in word, in thought, in deed; ever putting kindly <reg orig="in-|terpretation">interpretation</reg> <lb/>
on things. She literally 'suffered long, <lb/>
and was kind; was not easily provoked; thought no <lb/>
evil; bore all things, believed all things, hoped all <lb/>
things, endured all things.'"</p>
<p>Mrs. Tait's family, in the evening of her days, <reg orig="con-|sisted">consisted</reg> <lb/>
of three daughters and her son Craufurd. Her <lb/>
daughters had learned to imitate their dear mother <lb/>
<pb n="305" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0312"/>
in her many charitable works&mdash;to forget themselves <lb/>
in deeds of goodness. Many hearts and homes were <lb/>
blessed by their sympathy and help. They had <lb/>
learned that the many opportunities which their <lb/>
position gave them were the calls of duty, to which <lb/>
they yielded a willing and a cheerful response. But <lb/>
the hope and joy of Mrs. Tait's life was her son. <lb/>
From his earliest years Craufurd had been the joy <lb/>
and the brightest treasure of his home. As he <reg orig="ap-|proached">approached</reg> <lb/>
to manhood, and his character became <reg orig="de-|veloped">developed</reg>, <lb/>
he manifested the greatest interest in the <lb/>
various works in which his mother was engaged, and <lb/>
gave delightful promise of an earnest and useful life. <lb/>
After leaving the university, where he took his <lb/>
degree and attained considerable honour, he began <lb/>
work as a village pastor, full of Christian kindness of <lb/>
heart, greatly beloved and respected, inspiring all <lb/>
who knew him with bright hopes for his future. <lb/>
Subsequently he became his father's domestic <reg orig="chap-|lain">chaplain</reg>, <lb/>
and made home more dear by his presence. He <lb/>
became his mother's and his father's constant <reg orig="com-|panion">companion</reg>, <lb/>
and would pray with his mother in any <lb/>
time of trial or difficulty. "Often," says his father, <lb/>
"in the private chapel at Lambeth and at Addington <lb/>
we all listened with attention and edification to the <lb/>
natural outpourings of his deep religious feelings and <lb/>
to his simple statements of the gospel rules of life." <lb/>
After visiting the East and America, where he made <lb/>
many valued friendships, he obtained the incumbency <lb/>
<pb n="306" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0313"/>
of St. John's, Notting Hill, which presented the <reg orig="de-|sired">desired</reg> <lb/>
opportunity for work. But this was not to be. In <lb/>
a very short time, before he had commenced his work <lb/>
at Notting Hill, in his twenty-ninth year, full of <lb/>
promise and of earnest affection, with everything to <lb/>
make life joyous and happy, he passed away to his <lb/>
eternal home. His father, in describing his end, says: <lb/>
"He set himself to use the hour before his death, <lb/>
feeling that as before his business had been to live, <lb/>
so now it was to die. The presence of those he loved <lb/>
greatly cheered and comforted him. He was the <lb/>
calmest of us all, and almost seemed to be helping us <lb/>
to bear up. He addressed kind messages to each, <lb/>
turned on his side like a tired child, and fell asleep <lb/>
in Jesus. Blessed end to a manly, simple life; yet <lb/>
not the end&mdash;rather surely the beginning of a new life <lb/>
into which he passed, while he left us overwhelmed <lb/>
by his bedside."</p>
<p>None, except a mother who has had a dear son <lb/>
taken from her side, can conceive of the void <reg orig="exper-|ienced">experienced</reg> <lb/>
by Mrs. Tait on the death of loved and loving <lb/>
Craufurd. But she did not permit herself, <reg orig="over-|burdened">overburdened</reg> <lb/>
as she was with grief, to neglect or forego <lb/>
her duties. As soon as possible, after the closing <lb/>
scene of her son's life, she actively resumed her work <lb/>
at the Orphanage, and with her husband made <reg orig="pre-|paration">preparation</reg> <lb/>
for the reception of one hundred bishops, <lb/>
who were to assemble at Lambeth at the invitation <lb/>
of the archbishop. When that meeting and <reg orig="confer-|ence">conference</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="307" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0314"/>
were over, Mrs. Tait, in the company of her <reg orig="hus-|band">husband</reg> <lb/>
and three daughters, visited Switzerland, in the <lb/>
hope that change of scene would restore the health <lb/>
which had become so much depressed. Shortly after <lb/>
the return of the family to England, the second <lb/>
daughter was married in the Lambeth chapel. Little <lb/>
did she think, when taking leave of her mother, that <lb/>
she would never see her on earth again! On the <lb/>
morning after the marriage, Mrs. Tait, the archbishop, <lb/>
and the two remaining daughters left for Edinburgh. <lb/>
Some cheerful, happy days were spent in Scotland, <lb/>
without thought or fear of the great impending <lb/>
calamity. On the way to Edinburgh, in returning, <lb/>
Mrs. Tait was evidently unwell, and on her arrival <lb/>
the physician ordered her to bed. Only one short <lb/>
week more, and the dear mother had joined her loved <lb/>
son in the home for which her life had been a <reg orig="con-|tinuous">continuous</reg> <lb/>
preparation. When the icy hand of Death <lb/>
was closing upon her, the stricken archbishop read <lb/>
hymns and portions of Scripture that she loved; and <lb/>
her daughters sang some of her favourite hymns&mdash; <lb/>
"Lo! He comes, with clouds descending;" and "Lead, <lb/>
kindly Light, amid the encircling gloom." Presently <lb/>
she became unconscious; her breathing ceased with a <lb/>
gentle sigh, and she was gone!</p>
<p>The archbishop, in closing the account of his <lb/>
overwhelming loss, says: "Thus ended her earthly <lb/>
life of fifty-nine years&mdash;refreshed from her childhood <lb/>
onwards, through the grace of God, by a wellspring <lb/>
<pb n="308" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0315"/>
of joy within, which poured forth in acts of kindliness <lb/>
to all whom she could reach; a life sanctified by <lb/>
prayer, disciplined by abundant suffering, ever <reg orig="thank-|ful">thankful</reg> <lb/>
to God, active, cheerful, mixing in the world's <lb/>
innocent enjoyments, and resolute to fulfil all worldly <lb/>
duties; yet not of the world&mdash;meet preparation for <lb/>
the life of a glorified saint in the immediate presence <lb/>
of the Father and Redeemer."</p>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"No earthly clinging&mdash;no lingering gaze&mdash;</l>
<l>No strife at parting&mdash;no sore amaze;</l>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> remark is very true, that those periods of <lb/>
history of which we have heard the least <lb/>
have been the happiest; they have been <lb/>
unmarked by the loud alarms of war, <lb/>
and peace and quiet have blessed the earth. Not <lb/>
less is it true that some of the most quiet and <reg orig="unos-|tentatious">unostentatious</reg> <lb/>
lives have been noble and heroic; and <lb/>
although the world has not known of their deeds <lb/>
and thoughts, they have been not less useful and <lb/>
have lived not less divine lives than those whose <lb/>
praise is in all the earth. Such a life was the life of <lb/>
the Baroness Bunsen, who lived a loving and lovable <lb/>
<pb n="310" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0317"/>
life, whose words and thoughts remain to incite to <lb/>
pure lives and lofty deeds. To come into the <reg orig="pres-|ence">presence</reg> <lb/>
of the baroness, and to breathe the atmosphere <lb/>
which surrounded her life, is to ascend to a region of <lb/>
peace and quiet, wherein both the heart and the mind <lb/>
are at perfect rest.</p>
<p>Frances Waddington, afterwards the Baroness <lb/>
Bunsen, was born at the White House of Llanover, in <lb/>
Wales. The first recollection that Frances had of any <lb/>
event that transpired in her early years was that of <lb/>
sitting for a portrait to a deaf and dumb <reg orig="miniature-|painter">miniature-painter</reg> <lb/>
at Bath, where her parents were staying for <lb/>
a short period in 1796, and where she came in <reg orig="con-|tact">contact</reg> <lb/>
with several important personages. The next <lb/>
year Frances experienced her first great sorrow, in <lb/>
the death of her little sister Matilda; and learned <lb/>
her first but not her last lesson, that sorrow must be <lb/>
borne alone. Subsequently, with her parents, she <lb/>
made a journey to visit a number of relations, at <lb/>
Derby, Tuxford, and York; and interestingly widened <lb/>
her knowledge of men and manners. The next year <lb/>
she was at Bath, and saw Prince Ernest, afterwards <lb/>
Duke of Cumberland, later King of Hanover, who <lb/>
was very much like the gentlemen who accompanied <lb/>
him&mdash;"tall, fair, freckled, and flaxen-haired." She <lb/>
met at the same time Tom Sheridan, whose face <lb/>
and figure and the charm of his conversation <reg orig="re-|mained">remained</reg> <lb/>
with her as an interesting recollection <lb/>
through life. Shortly afterwards he went to the <lb/>
<pb n="311" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0318"/>
Cape of Good Hope, where death speedily ended his <lb/>
days. In 1798 Frances' father became the sheriff of <lb/>
the county,&mdash;in which year an attempt was made <lb/>
upon the life of King George III. in the theatre. <lb/>
During his absence in London, presenting an address <lb/>
of congratulation to his majesty, Frances <reg orig="accom-|panied">accompanied</reg> <lb/>
her mother to Derby. During their stay, news <lb/>
of the battle of the Nile was brought, and there <lb/>
were illuminations and general rejoicings. On <reg orig="return-|ing">returning</reg> <lb/>
home, the sad harvest failure in 1799 was <reg orig="ex-|perienced">experienced</reg>. <lb/>
Frances' father, in order to relieve the <lb/>
distress brought to his own door, wrote to his brother <lb/>
Joshua at New York, and had a quantity of flour <lb/>
sent him, which he sold at cost price, in small <reg orig="quan-|tities">quantities</reg>, <lb/>
to the poor. This example was followed by <lb/>
others; which course, no doubt, tended to reduce <lb/>
much of the general distress. And so life ran on in <lb/>
visits and being visited, until 1803, when Frances <lb/>
was first taken to London; at which time the peace <lb/>
was over, and the sound of war was again heard <lb/>
over the kingdom. She was taken to see the <reg orig="collec-|tion">collection</reg> <lb/>
of Mr. Townley, which subsequently formed the <lb/>
nucleus of the British Museum; and also some of the <lb/>
first paintings which were intended to form the <lb/>
National Gallery.</p>
<p>The family left London for Calwich in <reg orig="Stafford-|shire">Staffordshire</reg>, <lb/>
the residence of uncle Granville, where there <lb/>
was a capital library containing dark rows of books <lb/>
little used by the modern reader. These books, <lb/>
<pb n="312" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0319"/>
however, did not make an impression upon Frances <lb/>
equal to that of her aunt Fanny. In her later years <lb/>
the baroness said: "My aunt Fanny rises before <lb/>
me at this time as one of the rare combinations of <lb/>
feminine excellence that I have had opportunity of <lb/>
knowing as being such, in the course of my life; and <lb/>
I find it hard to give a just view of the degree of <lb/>
merit of which I became gradually conscious. Her <lb/>
true humility and self-abnegation were more <reg orig="espec-|ially">especially</reg> <lb/>
to be prized in one who had been a favourite, <lb/>
praised and admired on all sides, from her earliest <lb/>
years. She was a beauty, without doubt. Her skin <lb/>
was of exquisite whiteness; her small figure of perfect <lb/>
proportion and faultless modelling; her hands and <lb/>
arms, throat and bust, defied criticism. Devoted <lb/>
through life to her husband, to her children, to every <lb/>
fellow-creature whose needs or sufferings seemed to <lb/>
create a claim upon her, she lived up to her <reg orig="convic-|tions">convictions</reg> <lb/>
as a Christian, with a fulness of force in acting <lb/>
and suffering such as is everywhere uncommon." <lb/>
On the journey home, a visit was made to Warwick <lb/>
Castle, and its many wonders and objects of interest <lb/>
were duly explored.</p>
<p>The year 1805 brought important events&mdash;the <lb/>
terrors of an impending French invasion, the battle <lb/>
of Austerlitz, the death of Mr. Pitt, the battle of <lb/>
Trafalgar and the death of Nelson; all of which <lb/>
made an impression upon the sensitive and <reg orig="percep-|tive">perceptive</reg> <lb/>
mind of Frances.</p>
<pb n="313" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0320"/>
<p>When at home at Llanover, her education was <lb/>
entirely guided and directed by her mother, who <lb/>
had one maxim from which she never varied: <lb/>
"Whatever you do, do it with all your might." Idle <lb/>
hands and listless looks were never permitted for an <lb/>
instant. The moment attention flagged, the book <lb/>
was closed and put away. She did, however, receive <lb/>
some instruction in drawing from a female artist; <lb/>
and before she was six years old she had filled <lb/>
several volumes with drawings from nature. Her <lb/>
mother had unusual powers of expression, both in <lb/>
writing and in conversation. Frances was encouraged <lb/>
from an early age to commit poetry to memory, to <lb/>
read with her mother, and to write at her mother's <lb/>
dictation. In this way she acquired a vast amount <lb/>
of information upon many subjects, which was not <lb/>
forgotten through her long life.</p>
<p>In her fifteenth year she went to London with her <lb/>
mother, and was introduced to the royal family; and <lb/>
a few days later she was present at the trial of Lord <lb/>
Melville. The next year another visit was made to <lb/>
London, and to the royal family at Windsor; the <lb/>
members of which vied with one another in showing <lb/>
Mrs. Waddington and her daughters kindness. In <lb/>
the year 1809 Frances was taken to Edinburgh, <lb/>
after recovering from a dangerous attack of typhus <lb/>
fever, in order to have the instruction of masters <lb/>
and the advantage of society, which were denied her <lb/>
at home. The Edinburgh society to which Frances <lb/>
<pb n="314" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0321"/>
was introduced included Sir Walter Scott, Mr. <lb/>
Alison, and Mr. Jeffrey. These eminent men spoke <lb/>
in the highest terms of the singular mental powers <lb/>
possessed by Frances. At this time her favourite <lb/>
studies were Latin and mathematics; subsequently <lb/>
she made great proficiency in French and Italian. <lb/>
In the latter language, after one month's instruction, <lb/>
she could translate almost any word most faultlessly. <lb/>
These studies occupied Frances' leisure on the return <lb/>
of the family to Llanover; agreeably varied by the <lb/>
perusal of the novels of Sir Walter Scott, of which <lb/>
Frances wrote elaborate and most discriminating <lb/>
reviews to her friends, as they appeared.</p>
<p>In 1816 the family removed to Italy, to spend the <lb/>
winter; but little did Frances imagine that <reg orig="twenty-|three">twenty-three</reg> <lb/>
years would pass before she would see her <lb/>
Llanover home again. When in Rome, Mrs. <reg orig="Wad-|dington">Waddington</reg> <lb/>
drew around her all that was best in English, <lb/>
Italian, and German society. Among the most <reg orig="con-|stant">constant</reg> <lb/>
and welcome of the visitors was Christian <lb/>
Carl Josias Bunsen, who was remarkable for his <lb/>
scholastic attainments, and for his wonderful progress <lb/>
in his youthful years&mdash;a progress only made as the <lb/>
result of hard study. His constant custom was to <lb/>
rise in summer at four and in the winter at five <lb/>
o'clock, and then hasten with a joyous thought to <lb/>
his books and the desk in his study. But when in <lb/>
Rome he described himself as a "penniless student." <lb/>
Coming constantly into the presence of Frances <lb/>
<pb n="315" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0322"/>
notwithstanding his poverty and want of means he <lb/>
could not help being "a little in love" with one so <lb/>
gifted, and possessing sentiments and opinions so <lb/>
congenial to his own. When, ultimately, he declared <lb/>
his love for Frances, and asked her to become his <lb/>
wife, her parents were much startled by the <reg orig="reve-|lation">revelation</reg>, <lb/>
and appealed to Niebuhr for advice. The <lb/>
celebrated historian made answer: "The talents, <lb/>
abilities, and character of Bunsen are a capital more <lb/>
safely to be reckoned upon than any other, however <lb/>
securely invested; and had I a daughter myself, to <lb/>
such a man I would gladly consign her."</p>
<p>That which Niebuhr would have done, Frances <lb/>
parents did. On the first day of July 1817 Frances <lb/>
was married to Bunsen in the ancient chapel of the <lb/>
old Palazzo Savelli, which was then Niebuhr's <reg orig="resi-|dence">residence</reg>. <lb/>
Bunsen's first gift to his wife was his father's <lb/>
wedding-ring. "It is nothing very beautiful," he <lb/>
said; "but I hope you will let me see it sometimes <lb/>
on your hand. It was given with my father's <reg orig="bless-|ing">blessing</reg>, <lb/>
and I transfer it to you with it; it is a good <lb/>
blessing."</p>
<p>A few days after the marriage Mrs. Waddington <lb/>
returned to England with her youngest daughter, <lb/>
feeling that the pain of separation would be only the <lb/>
greater the longer it was delayed. Twelve years <lb/>
elapsed before Frances again met her mother, but <lb/>
there was no change in the love and affection <lb/>
she entertained for her revered parent; and her <lb/>
<pb n="316" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0323"/>
mother found in her daughter a noble type of <lb/>
wedded love&mdash;fulfilling to the utmost the duties of <lb/>
wife and mother, and continuing at the same time to <lb/>
be the intellectual and spiritual companion of her <lb/>
husband. This she remained,&mdash;year by year the <lb/>
union and relationship between herself and her <reg orig="hus-|band">husband</reg> <lb/>
becoming closer and more endeared, reading <lb/>
the same books and studying the same subjects. And <lb/>
then when little ones came, the happiness of Madam <lb/>
Bunsen was increased; and beautiful glimpses of a <lb/>
joyous domestic life were conveyed to her mother in <lb/>
her many charming and graphic letters. But the <lb/>
domestic life only fed and nourished the intellectual <lb/>
life. There was no cessation of the desire to acquire <lb/>
knowledge, to profit by the conversation and <reg orig="com-|panionship">companionship</reg> <lb/>
of Niebuhr, and the many gifted men <lb/>
with whom the Bunsens daily came into contact. <lb/>
The subjects that engaged her attention may be <reg orig="sur-|mised">surmised</reg> <lb/>
from the conclusion at which she arrived after <lb/>
a course of reading, in the words of Goethe&mdash;"The <lb/>
history of a man is his character;" and of Novalis&mdash; <lb/>
"The mind and the fate of an individual are but <lb/>
different words for the same conception." Her <reg orig="reli-|gious">religious</reg> <lb/>
convictions were well stated by herself when <lb/>
closing the reading of Patrick's "Pilgrim:" "Faith is <lb/>
a living and an active principle, which stimulates all <lb/>
those in whom it subsists to strive against the <reg orig="cor-|ruptions">corruptions</reg> <lb/>
of their moral nature, which rouses the best <lb/>
affections of the heart, and diffuses them over all <lb/>
<pb n="317" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0324"/>
fellow-partakers in the body of sin and death, <reg orig="fel-|low-heirs">fellow-heirs</reg> <lb/>
of the mercy of God through Christ." She <lb/>
manifested the active principle of faith upon the <lb/>
occasion of her cousin, William Waddington, coming <lb/>
to Rome to visit the antiquities. He was stricken <lb/>
with an infectious fever, which speedily caused his <lb/>
death; but not before Madam Bunsen had nursed <lb/>
him, and ministered to him in all kindly offices, <lb/>
despite the great probability of imbibing the <reg orig="con-|tagion">contagion</reg>, <lb/>
dreading nothing, intent alone on robbing <lb/>
death of its terrors, and winning a soul to Heaven."</p>
<p>After this trial there came other trials more severe <lb/>
and touching. The family had gone to Albano, at <lb/>
the invitation of the Niebuhrs, Bunsen being detained <lb/>
in Rome. The change was made chiefly on account <lb/>
of the little Mary, whose health had suffered from the <lb/>
summer heat. But, to the dismay of her mother, she <lb/>
did not improve; and presently, on the arrival of her <lb/>
husband, she had the hard task of telling him that <lb/>
their dear child was with God. Madam Bunsen had <lb/>
previously described the charms of the sweet child to <lb/>
her mother. "I have ventured," she wrote, "to take <lb/>
off my darling Mary's sleeves, and have now the <reg orig="con-|stant">constant</reg> <lb/>
treat of seeing her arms. If I could describe <lb/>
anything so beautiful as they are! or anything so <lb/>
beaming as her eyes! or so pretty as her mouth, her <lb/>
chin, her throat, the nape of her neck, her shoulders! <lb/>
And she is the merriest thing in the world, and <reg orig="en-|gaging">engaging</reg> <lb/>
beyond all conception; and, my mother, she <lb/>
<pb n="318" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0325"/>
is eight months old!" And then, when she had gone, <lb/>
she again wrote: "There is no pain, no grief in my <lb/>
heart; but a longing, an irresistible, alluring <reg orig="attrac-|tion">attraction</reg> <lb/>
to think of her&mdash;to look up to her, to pray to <lb/>
be with her." Two years afterwards Madam Bunsen <lb/>
had again to suffer the loss of another dear child&mdash; <lb/>
Frederick-Wilhelm, her fourth son, who was laid by <lb/>
his little sister in the Protestant Burial Ground.</p>
<p>Another trial, not an unfrequent one, was the <reg orig="in-|troduction">introduction</reg> <lb/>
of Bunsen's sister into his home. Bunsen, <lb/>
prior to his marriage, had desired to make a home <lb/>
for his sister. Now that he was married, he thought <lb/>
that in bringing her from Holland he was securing a <lb/>
friend for his wife and a guardian for his children. <lb/>
It was a mistake. For seven years and a half she <lb/>
became and continued an element of discord. She <lb/>
was, as Madam Bunsen said, "a ceaseless trial, putting <lb/>
feelings and principles to the severest test, and <reg orig="act-|ing">acting</reg> <lb/>
as a 'refiner's fire' upon all sterling realities." <lb/>
But during those years, and for many more years, <lb/>
Madam Bunsen was increasing her interest in all the <lb/>
affairs of public life with which her husband had <lb/>
become professionally identified, her company and <lb/>
conversation being sought by the highest personages <lb/>
of the kingdom. But her delight was with her <lb/>
family. One little fellow, George, had a will of his own, <lb/>
and exercised it; and his brother Charles, as Madam <lb/>
Bunsen wrote, "is nothing less than 'the deil himsel' <lb/>
with people he does not acknowledge have a right to <lb/>
<pb n="319" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0326"/>
direct him. But," she continued, writing to her <lb/>
mother, "my George and his little sister are the <lb/>
matter of unmixed delight. There never was any <lb/>
creature more alive to all impressions than that dear <lb/>
boy. He shows me the clouds when the sun is <reg orig="set-|ting">setting</reg>; <lb/>
points to the river, and gazes at it; watches <lb/>
the course of a flight of birds overhead; and his great <lb/>
enchantment is a herd of oxen grazing. He strokes <lb/>
and caresses his little sister, laughs loudly at her <reg orig="mo-|tions">motions</reg>, <lb/>
and shows her to everybody." One day her <lb/>
little boy Ernest broke his arm when the children <lb/>
were out walking with their mother. His scream of <lb/>
pain was quieted instantly when his mother said, <lb/>
"My boy, God has suffered this to happen, and God <lb/>
will help you; don't you know that?"</p>
<p>In the year 1827 Bunsen left Rome for Berlin, <lb/>
where he was received by the king in the most <reg orig="gra-|cious">gracious</reg> <lb/>
and distinguished manner. His return to Rome <lb/>
was delayed until the May of 1828. During his <reg orig="ab-|sence">absence</reg> <lb/>
his wife, in one of her letters, gives a glimpse of <lb/>
the affection which subsisted between herself and her <lb/>
distinguished husband: "Having been busy all <reg orig="morn-|ing">morning</reg> <lb/>
looking over papers, and putting accounts in <lb/>
order, I may now allow myself the refreshment of <lb/>
beginning a letter. My own dearest and best! it is <lb/>
a strange sensation that my thoughts have such a <lb/>
long space to travel over before they can reach you. <lb/>
But most thankful do I feel that this separation <lb/>
should take place now, instead of at any other time; <lb/>
<pb n="320" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0327"/>
this year, instead of last. On the past summer my <lb/>
thoughts will repose as long as I live with <reg orig="thankful-|ness">thankfulness</reg>: <lb/>
at no time did I feel you so near to me; at no <lb/>
time did I ever feel so fully how much you loved <lb/>
me; at no time did I ever feel so much satisfaction <lb/>
and delight in you. So it was just that a period of <lb/>
privation should follow one of fulness. I assure you <lb/>
I am not depressed. I am serious, but not <reg orig="melan-|choly">melancholy</reg>, <lb/>
at your absence, and in the consideration of the <lb/>
very important crisis that this journey must form in <lb/>
your life."</p>
<p>Many were the charming letters sent to her <reg orig="hus-|band">husband</reg>, <lb/>
all breathing the utmost love and affection, <lb/>
with pictures of home joys and social converse, which <lb/>
were the eminent characteristics of her daily home <lb/>
life. When Bunsen returned to Rome and his family, <lb/>
after an absence of eight months, a visit was made <lb/>
to Frascati for the summer months, where "Bunsen <lb/>
was happy in the undisturbed exercise of his <reg orig="facul-|ties">faculties</reg> <lb/>
in productive labour, in teaching his elder sons <lb/>
and superintending their studies, happy in the <reg orig="relaxa-|tion">relaxation</reg> <lb/>
and recreation furnished by the beautiful <reg orig="neigh-|bourhood">neighbourhood</reg>, <lb/>
happy in the society of chosen friends." <lb/>
Madam Bunsen was not less happy in the care and <lb/>
education of her children; she had a special talent <lb/>
for making her lessons interesting by illustration, <lb/>
and for fixing the facts of the world's history in the <lb/>
minds of her sons, by connecting them with the scenes <lb/>
they visited with her. Their Scripture lessons were <lb/>
<pb n="321" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0328"/>
often recalled with pleasure alike by mother and sons. <lb/>
"All my children knew and loved their Bible early," <lb/>
she wrote. "My Ernest, when driving out with me <lb/>
in the carriage, would sing to himself the history of <lb/>
Abraham, or some other part, language and tune being <lb/>
alike an improvisation."</p>
<p>After twelve years' separation, in the November of <lb/>
1829, Madam Bunsen's mother visited her and her <lb/>
dear children, and renewed that bond of love and <lb/>
affection which had ever subsisted between mother and <lb/>
daughter. Mrs. Waddington remained until the July <lb/>
of 1830, adding to the interest and charm of the <lb/>
society which gathered daily in Bunsen's home. <lb/>
When she returned to England, he wrote to her: <lb/>
"I never loved you enough, nor do I so now, when I <lb/>
contemplate all I admire, respect, and love in you: <lb/>
and I feel more than ever that so noble a soul, so <reg orig="gen-|erous">generous</reg> <lb/>
a heart, a mind so entirely occupied with the <lb/>
happiness of others, is never known nor loved as it <lb/>
ought; but that feeling, again, is happiness." <reg orig="Subse-|quently">Subsequently</reg> <lb/>
Madam Bunsen communicated to her mother <lb/>
the distressing intelligence of the death of their dear <lb/>
friend Niebuhr, and in a week after, that of his <lb/>
wife; adding, "Oh, what I would give to know <lb/>
that the highest grace had been granted to him which <lb/>
I think can be granted to a parent on the verge of <lb/>
the grave&mdash;that of yielding up a set of unprovided <lb/>
children into the hands of the common Parent, satisfied <lb/>
that God is not bound to any given means for securing <lb/>
<pb n="322" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0329"/>
their temporal and eternal interests, and that, whether <lb/>
he himself had lived or died, their welfare must <lb/>
equally have been the gift of Providence!" Another <lb/>
celebrated man&mdash;Sir Walter Scott&mdash;visited the <reg orig="Bun-|sens">Bunsens</reg> <lb/>
when he also was not long to remain upon the <lb/>
earth. This was in the May of 1832, when speech <lb/>
had almost deserted the great novelist. "But though <lb/>
his articulation is gone," wrote Madam Bunsen, "his <lb/>
conversation is much of the same sort as formerly, <lb/>
and his expression of goodness and benevolence really <lb/>
venerable, in the midst of physical decay. He is <lb/>
very weak in body, and, I am afraid, not well <reg orig="man-|aged">managed</reg> <lb/>
by his daughter, who is nervously anxious about <lb/>
him, but does not influence him." On leaving Madam <lb/>
Bunsen, Sir Walter said, "I hope and believe your <lb/>
own feelings prove your reward for the kindness and <lb/>
hospitality you have shown me."</p>
<p>When Madam Bunsen's son Henry was at school, <lb/>
he received many letters from his mother, filled with <lb/>
admirable advice. Reminding him of the possibility <lb/>
of their not being much together in the future, she <lb/>
wrote: "My dear boy, this separation is bitter; and <lb/>
yet we must not forget that the probabilities are that <lb/>
we shall pass our lives in separation: it is highly <lb/>
unlikely that you and your mother should ever again <lb/>
live much together. Therefore let us make the best <lb/>
of separation, and not put off communication to the <lb/>
uncertain time of meeting again. Tell me always as <lb/>
much as you can of what you think and feel, my <lb/>
<pb n="323" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0330"/>
own dear boy. That is often matter of effort, in <lb/>
absence and distance: but it is difficult to begin <lb/>
again, if once discontinued; and if once discontinued, <lb/>
estrangement is almost unavoidable. Yet you must <lb/>
not take time from exercise or sleep to write to me, <lb/>
and your day will be taken up in study. But I wish <lb/>
you would take a sheet of paper and write a bit at a <lb/>
time, just when you have time, and send the sheet <lb/>
off without minding whether the letter has beginning, <lb/>
middle, or end."</p>
<p>In 1837, the terrible scourge of cholera visited <lb/>
Rome, when Madam Bunsen, surrounded by her dear <lb/>
children, heard daily of the death of some friend or <lb/>
acquaintance who had fallen a victim to the dread <lb/>
disease. Her calmness under the fearful conditions <lb/>
by which she was surrounded&mdash;her husband being <lb/>
away in Berlin&mdash;was truly astonishing; her trust, <lb/>
however, was in her heavenly Father, in whose <lb/>
hands and providence she completely reposed. She <lb/>
wrote to her husband: "All are yet well in this <lb/>
house, and I feel thankful for every day passed in <lb/>
health; which one ought always to feel, but it needs <lb/>
a nearer threatening of the horrors of pestilence to <lb/>
be reminded of mercies daily received. If it please <lb/>
God to save us from the pestilence, he can do so <lb/>
under any circumstances." In the midst of this <lb/>
danger and distress, Bunsen wrote to his wife that it <lb/>
would be needful to leave Rome, not on account of <lb/>
the cholera, but of his employment with the king in <lb/>
<pb n="324" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0331"/>
Berlin; but in the midst of the packing preparations, <lb/>
which were almost completed, the news came that <lb/>
the departure was indefinitely deferred. Madam <lb/>
Bunsen, instead of indulging in regrets at the waste <lb/>
of time and trouble incurred in the preparation, <lb/>
immediately commenced to put all back again as <lb/>
before; and she wrote to her husband: "Never mind; <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">vendremo</hi> and I shall get through it; all will be <lb/>
done that must be done. I feel as high-spirited as <lb/>
ever." The cholera, like the trouble, passed without <lb/>
leaving any serious effects in the family. But there <lb/>
were other troubles awaiting Bunsen. A <reg orig="misunder-|standing">misunderstanding</reg> <lb/>
with the king at Berlin, with the king <lb/>
whom he had faithfully served, resulted in a <reg orig="prac-|tical">practical</reg> <lb/>
dismissal from his office, and a <hi rend="italic">permission</hi> to <lb/>
take a journey to England, which he had so <reg orig="fre-|quently">frequently</reg> <lb/>
sought.</p>
<p>On the 25th of August 1838, the family arrived at <lb/>
the house of Mrs. Hall in London; and then Madam <lb/>
Bunsen, with her children, proceeded to Wales, and <lb/>
received a public welcome at Llanover, from which <lb/>
she had been now absent twenty-one years. Many <lb/>
delightful days were spent in renewing acquaintance <lb/>
with the many objects of interest in South Wales. <lb/>
During this time, after a brief visit to Llanover, <lb/>
Bunsen was hard at work in London, where he was <lb/>
received and entertained with enthusiasm; which <lb/>
was increased, if that were possible, on being joined <lb/>
by Madam Bunsen. After seeing the sights of <lb/>
<pb n="325" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0332"/>
London, she accepted the invitation of Dr. Arnold to <lb/>
spend a few days at his residence at Foxhow, near <lb/>
Windermere, and to make the acquaintance of the <lb/>
many interesting objects in the Lake district.</p>
<p>After this quiet and pleasant breathing-time, <lb/>
Bunsen, in 1839, was appointed Minister from the <lb/>
King of Prussia to the Swiss Republic. The family, <lb/>
on their way to their new home, spent twelve <lb/>
"cheerful and untroubled days" in Paris. When at <lb/>
Berne, their new home, Madam Bunsen wrote: "We <lb/>
have at last jumbled ourselves and our belongings <lb/>
into proper places, so as to be quite happy in this <lb/>
house. My husband never was so comfortable before: <lb/>
his library all arranged in a sunny room that just <lb/>
holds it, with sofa, table, and standing desk for <reg orig="him-|self">himself</reg> <lb/>
and his literary occupations. He is full of <lb/>
activity of head and hand, taking full advantage of <lb/>
this delicious quiet." This quiet, however, was soon <lb/>
disturbed by the king's death&mdash;the king to whom <lb/>
Bunsen was so much indebted. Then when the new <lb/>
king, Frederick-William IV., was enthroned, Bunsen <lb/>
was sent to England, relative to the institution of a <lb/>
Protestant bishopric of Jerusalem. When in London <lb/>
he addressed a letter to Mrs. Waddington, relative to <lb/>
his wife:&mdash;</p>
<q><text id="d21"><body><div1 type="quotation">
<p>"It is a most solemn moment to me in which I <lb/>
address you. It is the twenty-fourth anniversary <lb/>
of that day on which your precious Fanny became <lb/>
my wife at Rome. You, then, and your excellent <lb/>
<pb n="326" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0333"/>
husband, gave her to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>,&mdash;to a stranger to you in <lb/>
blood and nationality, a young man you had fallen <lb/>
in with on the highroad of life, in a foreign country, <lb/>
without fortune, and without any other place in <lb/>
society except that which the education he had <reg orig="re-|ceived">received</reg> <lb/>
entitled him to. To him you confided what <lb/>
was most precious to you, not unconscious of the <lb/>
blame your friends would cast upon you. That <lb/>
man now addresses you as the envoy of one of the <lb/>
great kings of this world, a king who calls himself <lb/>
his friend, and who has proved to him a brother and <lb/>
a father; an envoy sent to your country on an object <lb/>
of a peaceful nature. If I were left to my own <lb/>
evil dispositions, I should say I am <hi rend="italic">proud</hi> of being <lb/>
on this day here to address to you, my dearest mother, <lb/>
the expression of unspeakable gratitude for the trust <lb/>
you reposed in me, for the affection you bore me, <lb/>
for the benefits and blessings you conferred upon me; <lb/>
but I hope I may say, by the grace of God, in truth, <lb/>
I feel <hi rend="italic">thankful</hi>, humbled to the dust by the <reg orig="recollec-|tions">recollections</reg> <lb/>
attached to this day in my mind, and by the <lb/>

since; the thanks of a man who, in the <lb/>

day of his existence feels more and more that your <lb/>
daughter is the centre of all of them. May God <lb/>
bless you, my dearest mother, here on this earth, and <lb/>

</div1></body></text></q>
<p>The family, on arriving in England, were settled in <lb/>
the residence of the Prussian Legation, Carlton <lb/>
Terrace, London; which soon became an intellectual <lb/>
centre&mdash;first to foreigners, gradually to Englishmen. <lb/>
All who were connected with what was best in <lb/>
theology, history, philosophy, in poetry, music, or <lb/>
painting, gravitated to the home of the Bunsens, <lb/>
where the host and hostess had the art of putting <lb/>
all at their ease. Those who visited them in their <lb/>
home remember the animation and interest of <reg orig="Bun-|sen">Bunsen</reg>, <lb/>
and the self-possession, sympathy, and benignity <lb/>
of Madam Bunsen. She could not, however, <reg orig="accus-|tom">accustom</reg> <lb/>
herself to what is called "London life." "I do not <lb/>
suppose people grow old in London any faster than <lb/>
they do elsewhere," she wrote, "but they certainly <lb/>
lead double lives, something beyond working double <lb/>
tides, in keeping even with the daily demands of <lb/>
life." The whirl, excitement, and fashion of a London <lb/>
season had no attractions for Madam Bunsen: in <lb/>
contrast to the quiet of the home she had left at <lb/>
Berne, she described it as "splendid misery." She, <lb/>
however, had to submit to the conditions of the <lb/>
position in which her husband was placed, and to <lb/>
visit the Queen at Windsor, and the many members <lb/>
of the nobility, when an intimate acquaintance was <lb/>
formed with the most important personages of the <lb/>
<pb n="328" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0335"/>
time. Madam Bunsen, however, while complying <lb/>
with the requirements of custom, wrote: "Oh! when <lb/>
one thinks of distress, how it does go to one's heart <lb/>
to spend money on a fine court dress; and how <lb/>
depressed and ashamed I felt yesterday morning, put <lb/>
out of countenance by my own conscience. But I <lb/>
was obliged to say, royalty is a thing most useful <lb/>
and necessary in the world; and if one is pushed <lb/>
close up against it, one must show the respect one <lb/>
feels in the manner appointed." But it was, <reg orig="not-|withstanding">notwithstanding</reg>, <lb/>
for Madam Bunsen&mdash;"splendid misery." <lb/>
It was this feeling, and the illness of several of the <lb/>
children, that induced Bunsen to take a country <lb/>
house at Hurstmonceaux, in Sussex, where the <lb/>
family could hold intercourse with nature, and be <lb/>
freed from the anxieties and absorbing nothings of <lb/>
London life. Another change had to be made <reg orig="sub-|sequently">subsequently</reg>, <lb/>
owing to the necessity of Bunsen being <lb/>
near to London. A suitable house was found at <lb/>
Oak Hill, where many calm and cheerful days were <lb/>
spent. It was from this residence that the loved son <lb/>
Ernest was married to the daughter of Samuel <lb/>
Gurney. The service was read by Henry Bunsen. <lb/>
This was the first occasion of the whole of the ten <lb/>
brothers and sisters meeting together. Then came <lb/>
years of absorbing whirl and fashion, which Madam <lb/>
Bunsen characterized as <hi rend="italic">humbug</hi>. "Pray, my own <lb/>
mother, forgive that word," she wrote,&mdash;"I think I <lb/>
never wrote it before; but there is so much of it <lb/>
<pb n="329" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0336"/>
everywhere, meeting me at every turn, twining in <lb/>
with almost everything, that to mark its absence <lb/>
alone constitutes a high commendation." The <reg orig="absorb-|ing">absorbing</reg> <lb/>
London life compelled the relinquishment of Oak <lb/>
Hill, and a residence of a year and a half in London, <lb/>
when another country residence was taken near <lb/>
Barnet, where much calm and quiet were enjoyed, <lb/>
and a busy and fully occupied life was lived. One <lb/>
of Madam Bunsen's pleasures, as it had always been, <lb/>
was reading the works of the great historical authors. <lb/>
Writing of Macaulay's "History," which was then <lb/>
appearing, she said: "I am feasting upon the <lb/>
'History.' How I always have desired, and desire <lb/>
more than ever, for my children the intense pleasure <lb/>
I have always had in history, in truth of facts, in <lb/>
reality of character. If I had pleasure in works of <lb/>
old, not such thorough histories as people have it in <lb/>
their power to write now, in proportion is the <reg orig="enjoy-|ment">enjoyment</reg> <lb/>
heightened of having men and conditions of <lb/>
society revealed in full light and shade, as Ranke <lb/>
has done and Macaulay is doing. I know not yet <lb/>
what the faults and deficiencies of Macaulay's '<reg orig="His-|tory">History</reg>' <lb/>
are: of course they must exist, as in everything <lb/>
human; but as yet my only feeling is obligation to <lb/>
him for giving me <hi rend="italic">ten</hi> reasons where I had <hi rend="italic">one</hi> <lb/>
before for holding opinions I have long held."</p>
<p>On the 15th day of January 1850, Madam <lb/>
Bunsen's mother was engaged relieving the poor and <lb/>
sending inquiries after the sick. Then, while sitting <lb/>
<pb n="330" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0337"/>
calmly listening to a letter of William von <reg orig="Hum-|boldt">Humboldt</reg>, <lb/>
she received her death-stroke. She rang the <lb/>
bell herself for her maid, walked to her bedroom, <lb/>
went to bed, assisting herself, but never spoke again. <lb/>
Her funeral was attended by all denominations of <lb/>
Christians, whom she had ever looked on with <reg orig="Christ-|ian">Christian</reg> <lb/>
sympathy, and treated as Christian brethren. As <lb/>
the coffin containing the honoured remains of Mrs. <lb/>
Waddington was conveyed to its last resting-place <lb/>
in the churchyard above the Usk, the Welsh dirge, <lb/>
"Gorphenwyd," was sung by the crowd as the <reg orig="mourn-|ful">mournful</reg> <lb/>
procession proceeded. The pall was carried by <lb/>
eight attached female servants: two daughters and <lb/>
a grand-daughter were at the head of the mourners. <lb/>
The grave is decked with flowers as the season comes <lb/>
round; and the house where she died is cared for <lb/>
lovingly by her youngest child. The rooms are kept <lb/>
fresh and bright, as if the dear mother were about to <lb/>
return.</p>
<p>Owing to political differences, Bunsen tendered his <lb/>
resignation to the King of Prussia in the April of <lb/>
1854, and decided to remove with his family to <lb/>
Germany, in order that he might pursue his loved <lb/>
literary labours without the distraction of London <lb/>
society. Heidelberg was selected, owing to its many <lb/>
attractions, where a very happy home was found for <lb/>
the subsequent five years. Very soon Madam Bunsen <lb/>
wrote to her daughter: "Your father was up at six <lb/>
o'clock yesterday morning, and at five this morning, <lb/>
<pb n="331" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0338"/>
lighting his fire and working at his writings." Here <lb/>
Madam Bunsen enjoyed the society of a portion of <lb/>
her children, and kept up a constant communication <lb/>
with the others, who were very widely scattered,&mdash; <lb/>
the great advantage to Bunsen being the <reg orig="undis-|turbed">undisturbed</reg> <lb/>
quiet which was obtained in the isolated <lb/>
residence, which enabled him to complete his work, <lb/>
"Signs of the Times;" 2,500 copies being sold in ten <lb/>
days. Madam Bunsen found a refreshing <reg orig="oppor-|tunity">opportunity</reg>, <lb/>
in this "life's pause," to read many of the <lb/>
valuable and remarkable books which were then <reg orig="pub-|lished">published</reg>. <lb/>
The list contained Milman's "Latin <reg orig="Chris-|tianity">Christianity</reg>," <lb/>
Gervinus's "History," Froude's "History," <lb/>
and Macaulay's "History." The reading of the last <lb/>
work Madam Bunsen described as "a delightful event <lb/>
in life." In writing to her husband, who was then in <lb/>
Switzerland, she said: "I rejoice in the accounts of <lb/>
your meeting people, and being stimulated the more <lb/>
to write what inquiring minds want to know. The <lb/>
greater part of minds, however, are not inquiring; <lb/>
the greater number want <hi rend="italic">humbug</hi>, and must make it <lb/>
if not ready made." One of the books which afforded <lb/>
Madam Bunsen great pleasure was "English Hands <lb/>
and English Hearts," the record of Miss Marsh's <lb/>
labours among the navvies at Beckenham.</p>
<p>In the December of 1858 it was found necessary, <lb/>
owing to the failing health of Bunsen, to again <lb/>
remove to a warmer climate&mdash;Cannes, in the south <lb/>
of France, being selected. "Here we are at Cannes," <lb/>
<pb n="332" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0339"/>
wrote Madam Bunsen to her son George, "inhaling, <lb/>
swallowing, bathing in sunshine, in beauty, in purity <lb/>
of air!" Here Bunsen marvellously recovered his <lb/>
health, and found strength to pursue his loved work. <lb/>
Then another change was made; this time to Bonn, <lb/>
where Bunsen trusted to end his days. A large <lb/>
house was purchased on the banks of the Rhine <lb/>
which was taken possession of in the May of 1860. <lb/>
On the 25th of August, Bunsen's birthday, he was <lb/>
surrounded by many old and valued friends, to <lb/>
whom he addressed many touching words. Six days <lb/>
after, it seemed as though he had come to the <reg orig="thresh-|old">threshold</reg> <lb/>
of his life. Most endearingly he bade his wife <lb/>
farewell&mdash;"his first, his only love," in whom he had <lb/>
"loved that which is eternal." "I depart from this <lb/>
world without any feeling of uncharitableness <reg orig="to-|wards">towards</reg> <lb/>
any one." "I see Christ, and see through <lb/>
Christ God." On the morning of the 28th the spirit <lb/>
of the grand, noble man, departed to join the spirits of <lb/>
just men made perfect. On his tomb a beautiful <reg orig="me-|dallion">medallion</reg> <lb/>
recalls his expressive countenance; and beneath <lb/>
are the words of Isaiah ii. 5, calling upon others to <lb/>
walk in that "light of the Lord" in which he lived.</p>
<p>On his deathbed, Bunsen had committed a solemn <lb/>
charge to his wife: "Write yourself the history of <lb/>
our common life. You can do it; you have it in <lb/>
your power; only be not mistrustful of yourself." <lb/>
In the first winter at Bonn the baroness began the <lb/>
work which was both a labour and a comfort for the <lb/>
<pb n="333" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0340"/>
next few years. The work was interrupted for a <lb/>
time by the death of her loved daughter Theodora, <lb/>
who left five children and a deeply attached husband. <lb/>
The baroness lost no time in reaching the house of <lb/>
mourning, and taking upon herself the care of the <lb/>
motherless children. "Neither Frances nor I," she <lb/>
wrote to her son George, "could live elsewhere than <lb/>
at Carlsruhe, under the consciousness that the <lb/>
precious orphans were left without maternal love <lb/>
and superintendence; and to be able to give them <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">that</hi> is a comfort counterbalancing every discomfort." <lb/>
The house and effects at Bonn were sold, and the <lb/>
baroness settled down to her new life in the little <lb/>
German town of Carlsruhe. She could do little <lb/>
more, at her advanced age, than "love the children <lb/>
and enjoy the delicious sight of them;" and work at <lb/>
the memorial of her husband. But she found time <lb/>
to write many of the valued letters which have been <lb/>
carefully preserved. To a friend who doubted if he <lb/>
could endure the difficulties of his position, she <lb/>
wrote: "Screw your courage to the sticking-place, <lb/>
and, let life bring what it will, say to yourself, 'It <lb/>
shall not get the better of me!' To be brought into <lb/>
a contingency, depended not upon yourself; to get <lb/>
out of a contingency, depends not, or may not depend, <lb/>
upon yourself; but to be <hi rend="italic">master</hi> of the crisis, and <lb/>
stand upright before it, that is your part.</p>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>Breast the wave, Christian, where it is strongest;</l>
<l>Look for day, Christian, when night is longest'!"</l>
</lg></q>
<pb n="334" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0341"/>
<p>When the baroness had attained her <reg orig="seventy-|fourth">seventy-fourth</reg> <lb/>
year she resolved to visit her children, her <lb/>
grandchildren, and the scenes of her early childhood <lb/>
in Wales. On her return from the most interesting <lb/>
journey, she wrote: "I feel drawn closer to each of <lb/>
my sons, and to each of their wives, in their varieties <lb/>
of character; all showing me an amount of attention <lb/>
which may be felt&mdash;and I do feel it through and <lb/>
through&mdash;but may not be told." On visiting the <lb/>
familiar scenes of Llanover, where she was received <lb/>
with ceaseless kindness and affection, visions of the <lb/>
departed, "departed never to return," seemed to <lb/>
people the silent region of verdure and flowers. She <lb/>
made sketches of the many well-known scenes, of <lb/>
which she had made drawings before she was six <lb/>
years old; and went again over the old walks and <lb/>
rides with much of the enthusiasm of her youthful <lb/>
years. "The contemplation of the several centres of <lb/>
life that I have been living in is most deeply <lb/>
engrossing. Each and all of these beloved ones, as <lb/>
well as all others present and absent, I place before <lb/>
Him who careth for each and all, and will guide and <lb/>
govern, and find a place in his paternal household, <lb/>
after the needs and requirements of each and all."</p>
<p>On the 3rd of February 1867, the baroness's <lb/>
youngest daughter died under most affecting <reg orig="circum-|stances">circumstances</reg>. <lb/>
Matilda had devoted herself to aiding and <lb/>
helping incurable idiots in the largest idiot asylum <lb/>
of Bavaria, situated at Neudettelsau. She selected <lb/>
<pb n="335" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0342"/>
her own work in the institution, namely, women and <lb/>
girls to whom no instruction could be given, totally <lb/>
helpless creatures, who had to be fed at their meals, <lb/>
&mdash;sleeping with five of the children; and yet being as <lb/>
cheerful as the day, declaring that she had found the <lb/>
amount of bodily work combined with the work of <lb/>
the heart she required. But this useful life on earth <lb/>
was not to be for long. A cold caught in the <reg orig="dis-|charge">discharge</reg> <lb/>
of her self-imposed duty confined her to her <lb/>
room, and then, despite all loving and professional <lb/>
aid, it was evident to all that death was approaching. <lb/>
On the Sunday evening the good pastor of the <lb/>
institution found her apparently sleeping or <reg orig="uncon-|scious">unconscious</reg>, <lb/>
and uttered words of prayer close to her ear. <lb/>
Suddenly there was a lull in the heavy breathing, a <lb/>
gentle shudder, and Matilda had gone. With loving <lb/>
hands she was placed in the quiet grave: the <reg orig="remem-|brance">remembrance</reg> <lb/>
of her sweet self-denying life is treasured by <lb/>
the inmates of the asylum as an incentive and <reg orig="en-|couragement">encouragement</reg> <lb/>
in their labours of love.</p>
<p>From this period till the distressing <reg orig="Franco-|Prussian">Franco-Prussian</reg> <lb/>
war, Madam Bunsen lived with her <reg orig="grand-|children">grandchildren</reg> <lb/>
at Carlsruhe, visited her friends, read <lb/>
historical works and the new books coming from <lb/>
the press, and wrought for the poor. When the <lb/>
war commenced, she wrote: "What shall I say of <lb/>
the oppression on one's mind from the images of this <lb/>
horrible war. All hands belonging to me are <reg orig="work-|ing">working</reg> <lb/>
hard for the wounded, and have one day in the <lb/>
<pb n="336" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0343"/>
week when the day is full of helping ladies, English <lb/>
and Swiss, and some German. Alas! my eyes can <lb/>
no longer help in sewing, but they paint flowers <lb/>
without end." She again wrote: "It is not in money <lb/>
only that Carlsruhe has helped. I verily believe <lb/>
there has not been a woman who has not worked all <lb/>
the winter either at woollen clothing for the soldiers, <lb/>
supplementary or gratuitous, or at nursing the <lb/>
sufferers: there have been no balls, no theatre, so <lb/>
people had something to spare." And when the war <lb/>
was ended, she wrote: "Will the awful breaking up <lb/>
of the 'whited sepulchre,' disclosing all uncleanness, <lb/>
as in the case of the poor French nation, prove a <lb/>
warning to others against prevailing atheism? Will <lb/>
people seek after God 'in spirit and in truth,' and <lb/>
cast away the forms of whatever denomination which <lb/>
keep out the light, and shackle and warp what 'God <lb/>
made upright' and free?"</p>
<p>Notwithstanding that the baroness had passed her <lb/>
eightieth year, she manifested an intelligent and <lb/>
lively interest in the affairs of the various <reg orig="nation-|alities">nationalities</reg>, <lb/>
and greatly rejoiced at the result of the war&mdash; <lb/>
the unity of the German nation. She was ever <lb/>
desirous of the earnest and the practical, whether in <lb/>
a nation or in an individual. Writing to her son <lb/>
George, she said: "I delight in the impression your <lb/>
dear children make&mdash;of originality and sterling stuff. <lb/>
I trust, too, that they are bred up not to expect of <lb/>
life what life is not likely to grant them&mdash;a course <lb/>
<pb n="337" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0344"/>
of <hi rend="italic">so-called harmless</hi> dawdling and self-cherishing." <lb/>
"A sphere of duty so clear and simplified, that one <lb/>
could always be in it, and always absorbed in it, <lb/>
seems to me the unattainable happiness of life, and it <lb/>
will probably form the happiness of a higher and <lb/>
more perfect condition." The last letter that the <lb/>
dear baroness wrote was directed to Dean Stanley, on <lb/>
the occasion of the death of his wife, Lady Augusta <lb/>
Stanley; the letter concludes with these touching <lb/>
words: "Such an intimacy, such an active unity of <lb/>
heart, of principle, as has been yours, dear friend, <lb/>
was a rare gift of the beneficent Providence which <lb/>
made <hi rend="italic">her</hi> what she was, and conducted each and <lb/>
both of you to find in each other that which made <lb/>
life worth living for; and may the blessed <reg orig="conscious-|ness">consciousness</reg> <lb/>
of what has been granted to you afford you <lb/>
strength to look through the darkness which to flesh <lb/>
and blood seems to belong to the 'grave and gate of <lb/>
death.' With a tenderness of maternal feeling which <lb/>
I cannot well express, I remain your aged friend, <lb/>
Frances de Bunsen."</p>
<p>A fitting close to the many expressive and <reg orig="pleasur-|able">pleasurable</reg> <lb/>
letters with which she strewed the pathway of <lb/>
her life, and which exhibit the wonderful powers of <lb/>
her mind and the goodness, the unlimited warmth <lb/>
and feeling of her heart. But these letters were <lb/>
come to an end: the last had been written, and the <lb/>
days of the good baroness were numbered. On the <lb/>
morning of the Easter Sunday of 1876, her daughter <lb/>
<pb n="338" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0345"/>
Emilia found her at seven o'clock in the morning <lb/>
seated by the window of her bedroom, reading scraps <lb/>
of hymns, which she always carried in her pocket. <lb/>
She met her daughter with a warm embrace, and a <lb/>
beaming, heavenly look, which was ever afterwards <lb/>
remembered. The morning was spent in reading <lb/>
hymns in Bunsen's collection, and in the afternoon she <lb/>
walked out for half an hour with one of her <reg orig="grand-|daughters">grand-daughters</reg>. <lb/>
In the evening the baroness desired to <lb/>
rest, and did not sit as usual at the tea-table; but <lb/>
presently she had read to her portions of Gossner's <lb/>
Life, upon which she commented as usual, although <lb/>
in a much weaker voice. The following day she <lb/>
did not leave her bed, but was able to hear a letter <lb/>
read from Miss Nightingale, and to take interest in <lb/>
some incidents connected with the children. On the <lb/>
following two days her strength failed rapidly. As <lb/>
it was apparent that the life of the good baroness <lb/>
would not much longer be continued, her children <lb/>
were hastily summoned to her bed-side. To some <lb/>
of them the consolation of seeing their dear mother <lb/>
again in life was not granted. When visited by <lb/>
the pastor of Carlsruhe, whom she recognized and <lb/>
welcomed, she seemed presently to fall into deep <lb/>
slumber; but when her daughters asked him to pray, <lb/>
there was an almost invisible motion of her hand in <lb/>
acquiescence; and they heard with a thrill&mdash;from her <lb/>
who seemed already so very far off&mdash;a distinct "Amen" <lb/>
at the end of the prayer. At seven o'clock of the <lb/>
<pb n="339" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0346"/>
last day that the baroness spent upon the earth, as she <lb/>
lay in the arms of her daughter Frances, her spirit <lb/>
departed to join those she had loved and who had gone <lb/>
before. Without pain or suffering, without distress <lb/>
or anxiety, she gently and peacefully departed.</p>
<p>The coffin that contained the remains of the <lb/>
baroness, covered with flowers cut by loving hands, <lb/>
was laid beside his, the husband, whom the baroness <lb/>
had loved so well. It was fitting that they who <lb/>
had been one in life should be joined in the silent <lb/>
tomb. And are they not joined in the better world, <lb/>
where happiness is complete and knows no end? Are <lb/>
they not now reaping the fruition of their earthly life <lb/>
in the presence of blessed spirits made perfect?</p>

than the great. The quiet, useful, <reg orig="unos-|tentatious">unostentatious</reg> <lb/>
life wins its way and permeates <lb/>
society, diffusing and receiving priceless <lb/>

to all that is true and good, performing duties <reg orig="will-|ingly">willingly</reg> <lb/>
and cheerfully in the eye of the Father, whose <lb/>
"Well done" swells the heart with fulness of joy and <lb/>
happiness. There was true wisdom in the <reg orig="remem-|brance">remembrance</reg> <lb/>
of J. C. Hare, when he wrote: "My mother <lb/>
had always tried to make the simple experience of <lb/>
her own quiet life as useful to others as it might be, <lb/>
<pb n="341" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0348"/>
and many who came to visit her had found in her <lb/>
gentle counsel that help and comfort which many <lb/>
books and much learning had failed to inspire." Dr. <lb/>
Blaikie said that she "breathed an atmosphere of <lb/>
charity, and by her gentleness and sweetness of <lb/>
nature threw a charm on every one around her, <reg orig="leav-|ing">leaving</reg> <lb/>
fragrance on every footstep."</p>
<p>Maria Leycester, afterwards Mrs. Augustus W. <lb/>
Hare, was born on the 22nd of November 1798. <lb/>
Her grandmother repeated the quaint Cheshire <reg orig="say-|ing">saying</reg> <lb/>
on seeing the new-born babe: "Well, she is <lb/>
hearty fow &lsqb;very ugly&rsqb; to be sure." Her mother <lb/>
died when she was but a child; but when in her <lb/>
seventieth year Maria had a distinct remembrance of <lb/>
the appearance of her mother, and of many early <lb/>
incidents. Referring to her in her latest years, she <lb/>
said: "She taught me in all my lessons except <lb/>
French; but her weak health and bad headaches often <lb/>
prevented her hearing me, and many a time I had to <lb/>
stand outside her door waiting until I could be heard, <lb/>
which fretted me a good deal. When the lesson <lb/>
went ill, I was sentenced to sit on the staircase till I <lb/>
was good, and the task perfect." In after years, <lb/>
her second mother, Mrs. Oswald Leycester, used to <lb/>
say that when she had suggested the doing of <reg orig="some-|thing">something</reg> <lb/>
because it would be <hi rend="italic">pleasant</hi>, she would turn <lb/>
to her and say, "I think my little girl has a better <lb/>
motive for it; what is it, Maria?" and "Because it is <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">right</hi>," was the reply. Fortunately she had in her <lb/>
<pb n="342" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0349"/>
earliest years a most affectionate nurse, who, many <lb/>
years afterwards, when she was married, and had a <lb/>
little boy of her own, said, "Oh, Miss Maria, I think <lb/>
I am beginning to love him almost as much as I did <lb/>
you!" To her last days Mrs. Hare remembered the <lb/>
many delightful walks taken with her nurse. She <lb/>
was also very happy with her two brothers, Edward <lb/>
and Charles, who had a project of digging through <lb/>
the earth to the other side of the world. Their <reg orig="holi-|days">holidays</reg>, <lb/>
spent at home, were joyful days for Maria. <lb/>
Edward would take her upon his knee and tell her <lb/>
delightful stories of Sinbad and Ali Baba; her <reg orig="know-|ledge">knowledge</reg> <lb/>
of similar stories was obtained from "Tales of <lb/>
the Genii" and books of a similar class, read with <lb/>
the greatest interest. "My white frocks," wrote Mrs. <lb/>
Hare, "were of lawn or Irish cloth, without any <lb/>
work or ornament; and when I went out, I used to <lb/>
wear a little green baize coat. My food also was of <lb/>
the simplest kind, consisting principally of <reg orig="butter-|milk">buttermilk</reg> <lb/>
and potatoes."</p>
<p>Her sister, who married Edward Stanley, rector <lb/>
of Alderley, afterwards Bishop of Norwich, the father <lb/>
of Dean Stanley, returned from school in 1806, and <lb/>
continued her education at home, converting a little <lb/>
dressing-room into a study, where she read and <lb/>
wrote, and where Maria also "set up a little table <lb/>
with books and writing things," and prepared her <lb/>
lessons under her sister's instruction. Her father, <lb/>
who was a clergyman, lived partly at his rectory at <lb/>
<pb n="343" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0350"/>
Knutsford, and partly at Toft, in Cheshire, the old <lb/>
place that had been five hundred years in the family. <lb/>
In 1806 the family removed to Stoke-upon-Terne, <lb/>
the living of which had been presented to Mr. <reg orig="Leyces-|ter">Leycester</reg>; <lb/>
in which church, on the 8th of May 1810, Maria's <lb/>
sister was married to the Rev. Edward Stanley. Her <lb/>
sister having been removed, "my father," wrote <lb/>
Maria, "gave me lessons in, it must be confessed, bad <lb/>
French and Italian; but it was my sister who still <lb/>
directed my studies by letter, constantly sending me <lb/>
questions on the books which I read, and expecting <lb/>
me to write her the answers. In this way I in a <lb/>
certain sense conducted my own education; and much <lb/>
did I enjoy these studies. Sometimes they were <reg orig="car-|ried">carried</reg> <lb/>
on in a little bathing-house on an island in the <lb/>
river Terne, which had been given to me as a <reg orig="posses-|sion">possession</reg> <lb/>
to plant as I liked with primroses, violets, and <lb/>
snowdrops; which was a great delight."</p>
<p>In her early years Maria had the advantage of <lb/>
good society, which imparted that which always sat so <lb/>
gracefully upon her,&mdash;the easy manners of cultivated <lb/>
life without stiffness or affectation. She and her <lb/>
brother Edward were frequently taken on a visit to <lb/>
Penrhyn Castle, in Wales; which, owing to the <reg orig="beau-|tiful">beautiful</reg> <lb/>
scenery, was always a great enjoyment. Lady <lb/>
Penrhyn, however, was offended that her little <reg orig="visi-|tors">visitors</reg> <lb/>
admired the mountains more than her poultry, <lb/>
of which she was very proud. She had also three <lb/>
pug dogs, which were very ugly, and which were <lb/>
<pb n="344" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0351"/>
always dressed in little scarlet bonnets and cloaks. <lb/>
When Lady Penrhyn resided at Grosvenor Square, <lb/>
her London residence, the pugs were regularly taken <lb/>
out by the footman for a walk in the square. When <lb/>
Lady Penrhyn died the dogs had an annuity left <lb/>
them, which they lived to enjoy for "an immense <lb/>
time." On one occasion when Lord and Lady <reg orig="Pen-|rhyn">Penrhyn</reg> <lb/>
were driving through the streets of Northwich, <lb/>
the pugs were looking out of the windows, and the <lb/>
bystanders, mistaking their species, exclaimed, "Eh! <lb/>
milord and milady are mighty fine, but their <reg orig="chil-|dren">children</reg> <lb/>
are hearty fow."</p>
<p>In the July of 1812 Maria's mother had a paralytic <lb/>
stroke, which prevented her again speaking clearly. <lb/>
Every night during her affliction Maria read to her, <lb/>
and prayed by her bedside before going to her own <lb/>
room. On the night of the 12th of October she was <lb/>
again subjected to another stroke, which caused her <lb/>
death on the following day. A sad and deeply-felt <lb/>
calamity. Maria said, on writing of her mother: "I <lb/>
do not remember ever hearing the slightest cross or <lb/>
angry word pass her lips. She preferred everybody's <lb/>
opinion before her own, and thought no good office <lb/>
too trivial for her performance. She seemed only <lb/>
able to see the good in others, and was ever willing <lb/>
to make allowance for their faults. To the poor she <lb/>
was most kind and charitable, working for them <reg orig="her-|self">herself</reg> <lb/>
with the greatest diligence, and assisting them in <lb/>
every way." The loss of her loved mother was deeply <lb/>
<pb n="345" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0352"/>
felt by Maria, who, in the first moments of her great <lb/>
sorrow, poured forth her soul in prayer: "O may I <lb/>
always act as she would wish me to do if she were <lb/>
present; and may I look for that motherly protection, <lb/>
of which I am bereft here on earth, to my heavenly <lb/>
Father." It was this bereavement which caused <lb/>
Maria to look beyond this world for the highest <lb/>
source of comfort; and from thence she derived the <lb/>
incentive to make her life useful and helpful to others. <lb/>
In her endeavours for self-improvement she was <lb/>
greatly aided by her sister, who largely took the <lb/>
place of her mother, writing her admirable, inspiring <lb/>
letters. When the June of 1814 arrived, her father <lb/>
was married to Eliza White, the beloved cousin of <lb/>
his first wife; which proved a very happy and <reg orig="judi-|cious">judicious</reg> <lb/>
choice, tending not only to the happiness of <lb/>
Mr. Leycester, but of his children, who became <reg orig="lov-|ingly">lovingly</reg> <lb/>
attached to her. Before the marriage was <reg orig="cele-|brated">celebrated</reg>, <lb/>
Miss White wrote to Maria: "I wish you to <lb/>
be to me only what you have ever been ever since <lb/>
you could distinguish right from wrong. The terms <lb/>
'authority' and 'obedience' must not be known or <lb/>
felt among us; we must live together as persons <lb/>
united for life in the bonds of mutual affection and <lb/>
social interest, each seeking to live for the happiness <lb/>
of the other, and striving to banish every selfish <reg orig="con-|sideration">consideration</reg>. <lb/>
God bless you, my own little Maria." <lb/>
And no promise and intention were ever more <reg orig="faith-|fully">faithfully</reg> <lb/>
kept: Miss White, when she became Mrs. <reg orig="Ley-|cester">Leycester</reg>, <lb/>
<pb n="346" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0353"/>
performed faithfully the duties of a loving, <lb/>
companionable mother.</p>
<p>Maria had also the valued friendship of Reginald <lb/>
Heber, who was the rector of Hodnet, near her <lb/>
father's house. His influence upon her continued <lb/>
through life. He had a bright, cheerful, loving <lb/>
nature, which converted his home into an "enchanted <lb/>
palace." It was a sad deprivation when Heber went <lb/>
to India. The light of all that was joyous and glad <lb/>
seemed to have gone away. In addition to the <lb/>
departure of Heber, there was another deprivation in <lb/>
the departure of Heber's curate. Between Marcus <lb/>
Stow and Maria there had sprung up an attachment, <lb/>
prompted, on her part, by high respect; but her <lb/>
father would not consent to the marriage, and <reg orig="Mar-|cus">Marcus</reg> <lb/>
went with Heber to India, where in a short time <lb/>
he died of fever. Stow's most intimate and <reg orig="cher-|ished">cherished</reg> <lb/>
friend was Augustus W. Hare, whose <reg orig="friend-|ship">friendship</reg> <lb/>
had been acquired at Hodnet by Maria <reg orig="Leyces-|ter">Leycester</reg>, <lb/>
and who had written some poetry at her request <lb/>
to celebrate her birthday. Augustus had been <reg orig="in-|tended">intended</reg> <lb/>
for the Church, but up to this period he <lb/>
had shrunk from entering the ministry; when, <reg orig="how-|ever">however</reg>, <lb/>
the news of poor Stow's death reached him, the <lb/>
thought occurred, "If I were to die now, without <lb/>
ever having been of use!" The thought nerved him <lb/>
to take a decisive step, and that evening he decided <lb/>
upon taking orders. Maria Leycester felt the death <lb/>
of Marcus Stow very acutely, and naturally turned <lb/>
<pb n="347" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0354"/>
to his friend Augustus Hare for consolation and <reg orig="sym-|pathy">sympathy</reg>. <lb/>
He had had the opportunity during the <reg orig="in-|tercourse">intercourse</reg> <lb/>
of Stow and Maria of thoroughly knowing <lb/>
and studying her character; the result was, as he <lb/>
wrote, "thorough esteem founded upon a conviction <lb/>
of her thorough excellence. And there the feeling <lb/>
would have rested but for my late loss; since which <lb/>
I have begun to feel desirous of securing, if possible, <lb/>
for myself, what up to that time I had loved to <lb/>
dwell on as a measure reserved for my best friend. <lb/>
To have been loved by him and educated by <reg orig="Regi-|nald">Reginald</reg> <lb/>
&lsqb;Heber&rsqb; doubles her value in my eyes." In the <lb/>
April of 1825, when Maria was at Alderley, and <lb/>
Augustus was also a visitor&mdash;one mourning the loss <lb/>
of her lover, and the other of a dearly-loved friend&mdash; <lb/>
after much mutual sympathy, Augustus, in speaking <lb/>
of his distress in going away, involuntarily disclosed <lb/>
his own feelings. Then, when subsequently Bishop <lb/>
Heber's death occurred in India, the deprivation to <lb/>
both Augustus and Maria only the more closely <lb/>
cemented their friendship, which presently deepened <lb/>
into love and heart-felt affection. When all was <lb/>
settled, Miss Leycester wrote: "How extraordinary <lb/>
and singular good fortune has attended me, that I <lb/>
should twice have met with that kind of deep <reg orig="feel-|ing">feeling</reg> <lb/>
which alone could, I think, have power to <reg orig="inter-|est">interest</reg> <lb/>
me,&mdash;that when the only species of happiness <lb/>
which I imagined to be perfect was taken from me, <lb/>
it should spring up again, as it were, from the ashes <lb/>
<pb n="348" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0355"/>
of the other, and assume a form nearly as beautiful, <lb/>
and I trust more enduring." The esteem which she <lb/>
entertained for Augustus Hare was materially <reg orig="in-|creased">increased</reg> <lb/>
in 1826, when in that year the brothers, <lb/>
Augustus and Julius Hare, sent out their famous <lb/>
"Guesses at Truth."</p>
<p>In the summer of 1828 Maria went with her sister <lb/>
and brother-in-law, their two children, and her friend <lb/>
Lucy Stanley, to Bordeaux and the Pyrenees; an <reg orig="ex-|cursion">excursion</reg> <lb/>
which afforded her the greatest delight. It <lb/>
was after the party returned home that Mr. Leycester <lb/>
gave his consent for the marriage of Maria with <reg orig="Au-|gustus">Augustus</reg> <lb/>
Hare. What were Maria's thoughts and <reg orig="feel-|ings">feelings</reg>, <lb/>
in the anticipated marriage, she revealed in one <lb/>
of her many letters:&mdash;</p>

<p>"After all the long uncertainty which has attended <lb/>
every future prospect I have ever had, the change <lb/>
now to thinking one may in reality look forward to <lb/>
the happy rectory I have so often fancied to myself, <lb/>
with one dear companion sharing every thought and <lb/>
feeling, is so great I can hardly at times feel it to be <lb/>
really so. Although to most people the prospect of <lb/>
a curacy on &pound;700 a-year would be a very <reg orig="promis-|ing">promising</reg> <lb/>
prospect, you may imagine how very little it <lb/>
will affect me, and how happy I may be with the <lb/>
smallest possible outward advantages, provided the <lb/>
essentials are there; and of this, the more I see of <lb/>
Augustus, the more I feel how impossible it is not to <lb/>
<pb n="349" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0356"/>
love him dearly and entirely: indeed, there is more <lb/>
fear of my loving too well than too little, and of the <lb/>
present happiness engrossing every thought and <reg orig="feel-|ing">feeling</reg> <lb/>
too much. But united as we are in interest about <lb/>
higher things than our mere present happiness, I do <lb/>
trust we may go on together through life improving <lb/>
and advancing to a better state than this can ever be <lb/>
under its best aspect. I cannot tell you how my <lb/>
heart overflows with love and gratitude to all in this <lb/>
time of joy; or how deeply sensible I am of the <reg orig="good-|ness">goodness</reg> <lb/>
which has led me through so many years of <lb/>
chastening and useful anxiety, to bring me to such a <lb/>
haven of peace and happiness as I cannot but hope <lb/>
our little home will be."</p>
</div1></body></text></q>
<p>On the 2nd June 1829, in her thirty-first year, <lb/>
Maria and Augustus were married. The next five <lb/>
months were spent by the happy couple at West <lb/>
Woodhay, which had been lent to them for their <lb/>
first months of married life. The letters from Mrs. <lb/>
Hare at this period abounded with thankfulness for <lb/>
her happiness, which she traced all to the hand of <lb/>
her heavenly Father. Her letters gave delightful <lb/>
glimpses of the perfect harmony of their new life; <lb/>
which was only interrupted, at the end of five years, <lb/>
by the death of Maria's fondly-loved husband. In <lb/>
one of her letters she said:&mdash;"Sometimes he reads to <lb/>
me a little; and anybody would have been amused <lb/>
to see him one evening reading me a sermon of <lb/>
Skelton's, 'How to be Happy, <hi rend="italic">though</hi> Married.' He <lb/>
<pb n="350" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0357"/>
is going with me through the Greek Testament, <lb/>
reading two chapters each morning after breakfast, <lb/>
and lecturing upon them, he reading the Greek, I <lb/>
the English; and he goes into it thoroughly. <reg orig="Some-|times">Sometimes</reg> <lb/>
he surprises me by, 'Now this is very difficult; <lb/>
I don't understand this one bit;' and so we compare <lb/>
different passages, see what is the connection, what <lb/>
is alluded to, etc.,&mdash;in short, it is a very interesting <lb/>
lecture&hellip;&hellip;I delight in our Sundays: the relief it is <lb/>
to cast one's self upon Him who will be with us in <lb/>
joy and in sorrow, and upon whom we may repose <lb/>
with sure confidence those trembling feelings of joy <lb/>
whose uncertainty is often felt, showing us the need <lb/>
of support even in rejoicing. I longed for you to be <lb/>
here last Sunday, to have heard my husband in the <lb/>
church. His preaching is so earnest, and brings the <lb/>
subject so home, that I cannot but feel all the time <lb/>
it must be doing good&hellip;&hellip;I am amused to think how <lb/>
little most women would have suited him, and how <lb/>
exactly I do. His love for ruminating by himself, <lb/>
to anybody without resources of their own, would <lb/>
be so dull, and he would not like that eternal <reg orig="inter-|ruption">interruption</reg> <lb/>
which many wives would give; then their <lb/>
being fussy about trifles, talking about their <reg orig="neigh-|bours">neighbours</reg>' <lb/>
concerns, vagueness, and the <hi rend="italic">very least</hi> regard <lb/>
to appearances or show, would annoy him so much; <lb/>
and yet, without liking a wife to be troublesome in <lb/>
fondness, he would ill have borne with the slightest <lb/>
coldness: so that, without vanity, I certainly am <lb/>
<pb n="351" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0358"/>
more adapted to his <hi rend="italic">wants</hi> than most could have <lb/>
been."</p>
<p>When the honeymoon was over, Augustus and <lb/>
Mrs. Hare removed to the small living of <reg orig="Alton-|Barnes">Alton-Barnes</reg>, <lb/>
perhaps the most primitive village in <reg orig="Wilt-|shire">Wiltshire</reg>. <lb/>
Seventy souls constituted the whole <reg orig="popu-|lation">population</reg>. <lb/>
The mental and spiritual condition of the <lb/>
scanty population may be inferred from the fact <lb/>
that one man, fifty years of age, wished to be <reg orig="con-|firmed">confirmed</reg>. <lb/>
"Do you know who Jesus Christ is?" <lb/>
"Why, please your honour, I canna rightly say." <lb/>
And yet to this most unpromising village Mrs. Hare <lb/>
went with her husband with much cheerfulness, in <lb/>
the hope of much usefulness. In the field adjoining <lb/>
the Alton-Barnes church there was another church, <lb/>
Alton-Priors, which seemed to be nearly deserted, <lb/>
and in which Mr. Hare was induced to conduct a <lb/>
service alternately with the service in his own <lb/>
church&mdash;in one in the morning, and in the other in <lb/>
the afternoon, the same congregation attending both <lb/>
churches. Mr. Hare's sermons were adapted to the <lb/>
understandings of his hearers. Fine writing and <lb/>
fine preaching found no sympathy in him. <reg orig="Inde-|pendently">Independently</reg> <lb/>
of the necessity of the gospel-message <lb/>
being delivered in words which his simple and <reg orig="unin-|structed">uninstructed</reg> <lb/>
hearers could understand, he had ever <lb/>
taken delight in pure mother-English, freed from <lb/>
all the foreign innovations that modern affectation <lb/>
has introduced. He became a father and a friend <lb/>
<pb n="352" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0359"/>
to the people of his small charge, and obtained in <lb/>
return their loving and affectionate confidence. A <lb/>
volume of discourses, "The Alton Sermons," remains <lb/>
to attest his simple earnestness in bringing the great <lb/>
truths of the gospel to the understanding and hearts <lb/>
of his rustic hearers.</p>
<p>One of the favourite sayings of Mr. Hare was, <lb/>
"We must get at the souls of the poor through their <lb/>
bodies." The arrival of a stock of clothing for the <lb/>
poor was an event of great rejoicing. The <reg orig="half-|starved">half-starved</reg> <lb/>
peasant, in receiving his warm jacket, was <lb/>
less glad at heart in his new possession than he who <lb/>
was thus enabled by God to share his abundance <lb/>
with those who needed it. Often would his heart <lb/>
seem full to overflowing, when, at a feast prepared <lb/>
for the old men and women among his flock, he <lb/>
waited on them himself, and by his gentle and <reg orig="lov-|ing">loving</reg> <lb/>
words gave a savour to their food which it <lb/>
would otherwise have wanted. In order to encourage <lb/>
the cottagers, he gave them each a portion of the <lb/>
glebe land, which they cultivated in the evenings <lb/>
when their daily work was done. Mrs. Hare, <reg orig="assist-|ing">assisting</reg> <lb/>
her husband in his humane efforts to help the <lb/>
poor, measured flannels, fustians, etc., in the shop <lb/>
which her husband opened once a-week in the <reg orig="rec-|tory">rectory</reg> <lb/>
barn, for the sale of all kinds of clothing and <lb/>
materials for clothing, which were sold to the poor <lb/>
people at two-thirds of the cost price. After thus <lb/>
ministering to their bodies, from their first <reg orig="settle-|ment">settlement</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="353" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0360"/>
at Alton, Mrs. Hare commenced a Sunday <lb/>
school. "My school on Sunday," she wrote, "mounted <lb/>
up from three to three and twenty, and some very <lb/>
nice girls, and all seeming very happy to be taught; <lb/>
so I had them in the afternoon in the usual <reg orig="church-|hours">church-hours</reg>, <lb/>
and made the bigger girls teach the little ones <lb/>
their letters." She wrote again: "I am very busy <lb/>
writing a sermon to be ready for Augustus's return. <lb/>
I don't know whether it will be of any use to him, <lb/>
but it is partly done in his style, which is rather <lb/>
that of plain talking than preaching. We have got <lb/>
a large cargo of flannel and blankets from Frome to <lb/>
cut up, and we shall give them the day after <reg orig="Christ-|mas">Christmas</reg>, <lb/>
which will be a good way of knowing people." <lb/>
The sermon was preached by her husband, who <reg orig="re-|marked">remarked</reg> <lb/>
that he never saw the people so attentive.</p>
<p>Thus usefully and happily passed two years of <lb/>
married life,&mdash;not without trouble, for in that period <lb/>
there had been the Wiltshire riots, when the <reg orig="peas-|antry">peasantry</reg> <lb/>
had broken the agricultural machines, under <lb/>
the impression that they would throw them all out <lb/>
of work. On the second day of June 1831 Mrs. <lb/>
Hare wrote: "Our third wedding-day! Two years <lb/>
of uninterrupted happiness have been granted to us <lb/>
&mdash;such years as perhaps may never again be <reg orig="per-|mitted">permitted</reg> <lb/>
us to enjoy. We have grown in love to each <lb/>
other, and in comfort with all around us. Have we <lb/>
grown as much as we ought in love and devotion of <lb/>
heart to our heavenly Master? <hi rend="italic">Something</hi> of <reg orig="ear-|nestness">earnestness</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="354" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0361"/>
in the great work appointed to us has, I <lb/>
would hope, been added to us; a few seeds scattered <lb/>
amongst our people have, I trust, been the <hi rend="italic">beginning</hi> <lb/>
of some good, which, by God's blessing, may spring <lb/>
up even from the weakest instruments." She wrote <lb/>
again to one of her friends: "You would have <reg orig="en-|joyed">enjoyed</reg> <lb/>
seeing Maria yesterday, busy preparing for her <lb/>
school-children, filling the jars with flowers, placing <lb/>
the table under the cherry-tree, all the children <lb/>
meanwhile peeping through the gate; and then, <lb/>
when all was ready, Augustus exclaiming, 'Throw <lb/>
open the doors,'&mdash;and putting each happy thing in <lb/>
its place. The feast concluded with the children <lb/>
singing the Morning Hymn, led by Maria." In this <lb/>
happy way the years rolled on. In every possible <lb/>
way of influencing the hearts and lives of the <reg orig="parish-|ioners">parishioners</reg>, <lb/>
Mrs. Hare devoted almost her every thought. <lb/>
The little place with its many deprivations and its <lb/>
many wants, its little low-roofed rooms, and the <reg orig="ab-|sence">absence</reg> <lb/>
of a garden, was all that Mrs. Hare and her <lb/>
husband desired; and when the rich family living <lb/>
of Hurstmonceaux fell vacant, Augustus would not <lb/>
quit Alton-Barnes, where he felt his life was so <reg orig="use-|ful">useful</reg>, <lb/>
and allowed his younger brother, his much-loved <lb/>
Julius, to occupy the living. Both Augustus and <lb/>
his cherished Maria had learned that money is only a <lb/>
means to an end; and that life without use and <reg orig="ser-|vice">service</reg> <lb/>
is a perfect blank. When, therefore, Lady <lb/>
Jones was found accidentally to have destroyed the <lb/>
<pb n="355" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0362"/>
will which would have given the Hares an important <lb/>
property, there was no repining or any abatement of <lb/>
that happiness which had its source in the approval <lb/>
and "Well done" of the heavenly Father. What <lb/>
money could purchase the joy, the peace, which filled <lb/>
the heart of Mrs. Hare when she wrote: "I have a <lb/>
new plan, which I hope will turn out useful. It is, <lb/>
to have a weekly meeting in Gideon's cottage for <lb/>
as many mothers of families as like to come. They <lb/>
are often unable to go to church, and most of them, <lb/>
I suspect, too ignorant to learn much when there; <lb/>
and if I go to their cottages, they are generally <reg orig="en-|gaged">engaged</reg> <lb/>
in washing or something unfriendly to one's <lb/>
doing any good. Betty Smith seemed quite <reg orig="de-|lighted">delighted</reg> <lb/>
with the proposal, and said she knew many <lb/>
who would be glad of it. So on Thursday at two <lb/>
o'clock I am to have the first meeting."</p>
<p>But all this quiet happiness and real usefulness <lb/>
were not to be much longer prolonged. In the March <lb/>
of 1833 Augustus Hare had an affection of the throat <lb/>
and a violent cough, which was the commencement <lb/>
of an illness from which he never recovered. Acting <lb/>
under medical advice, it was found necessary to <lb/>
leave England for a warmer climate. Italy was the <lb/>
country selected, where it was hoped, under God's <lb/>
blessing, he would be restored to health. A few <lb/>
days before he left England, he collected his people <lb/>
in the barn, and gave them a farewell supper. <lb/>
After praying with them and giving them a short <lb/>
<pb n="356" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0363"/>
exhortation, he was sitting quietly in his room, <lb/>
when the church singers, underneath the window, <lb/>
unexpectedly began the Evening Hymn. Quickly <lb/>
unfastening the shutter, his face working with <lb/>
emotion, he threw up the sash, exclaiming, "Dear <lb/>
people, how can I leave you?" and then sank back <lb/>
on a chair quite exhausted by the mental conflict, <lb/>
when a terrible fit of coughing came on.</p>
<p>On the way to Rome, the destination of the <reg orig="tra-|vellers">travellers</reg>, <lb/>
Augustus burst a blood-vessel, and for some <lb/>
time hovered between life and death; and when <lb/>
they became settled in the Eternal City, it became <lb/>
evident that health and energy were still far distant <lb/>
from the dearly-loved sufferer. Very shortly it was <lb/>
evident that for Augustus all work was over, and <lb/>
that he was fast nearing the end of his unselfish, <lb/>
blameless, and useful life. When he was just about to <lb/>
depart, he gave his Maria messages for every one; and <lb/>
made her tie the hair-chain she had given him before <lb/>
his marriage round his neck, to be buried with him; and <lb/>
said, "I must press you once more to my heart," which <lb/>
he did with all his remaining strength. He then said, <lb/>
"Now earth is passed away; I have nothing more <lb/>
to do with it." In the February of 1834 he went to <lb/>
his heavenly home in great peace; but not before he <lb/>
had told his loved Maria that she had been the <lb/>
dearest, tenderest, the most affectionate of wives. <lb/>
To Mrs. Hare the loss of her cherished and prized <lb/>
husband was a severe blow. She wrote: "My gourd <lb/>
<pb n="357" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0364"/>
has been taken away, but it has been transplanted a <lb/>
tree of righteousness into the Father's kingdom; and <lb/>
I desire to bless and praise Him who, for nearly five <lb/>
blessed years, has lent me this precious treasure. <lb/>
He has taken away my earthly idol. He takes from <lb/>
me the home I so delighted in; but it is to draw me <lb/>
nearer to himself; and I can only adore the love <lb/>
which chastens." Again she wrote: "God has <reg orig="be-|stowed">bestowed</reg> <lb/>
on me every earthly alleviation my sorrow can <lb/>
have; and for the loss itself, nothing but the strong <lb/>
persuasion that He who is love has so ordered it, that <lb/>
it must be best in his eyes, can give me any comfort. <lb/>
And shall I not rest all my cares upon him who in <lb/>
human form has borne our sorrows; and bless him <lb/>
for all the happiness he has lent me for a time, <lb/>
because he sees it good to do so? When my heart <lb/>
is quite sinking within me, I go to him in earnest <lb/>
prayer; and he has never yet failed to comfort me."</p>
<p>It was the occasion of much sorrow to Mrs. Hare <lb/>
that her married life had been childless. In order to <lb/>
compensate for the companionship of a son, she <lb/>
solicited Mr. and Mrs. Charles Hare, who had a <lb/>
numerous family, to allow her to have charge of <lb/>
their little Augustus, and to bring him up as her <lb/>
own. For thirty years her nephew brightened her <lb/>
home, and became to her a loving and affectionate <lb/>
son. On returning to England, after spending a few <lb/>
weeks at Alton, and taking leave of the dearly <lb/>
attached poor people, Mrs. Hare proceeded to <reg orig="Hurst-|monceaux">Hurstmonceaux</reg>, <lb/>
<pb n="358" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0365"/>
which she had resolved to make her <lb/>
home; her chief reason being a desire to be near <lb/>
Julius Hare. Most tenderly, with the most <reg orig="reveren-|tial">reverential</reg> <lb/>
love, was she welcomed to the home and heart <lb/>
of Julius, with whom, more than any other, she could <lb/>
hold constant communion concerning Him whose <lb/>
invisible presence and influence were equally felt by <lb/>
both. Mrs. Hare was truly in the home of her <lb/>
brother-in-law "as an angel in the house," linking <lb/>
on her present to her past life; taking up all her <lb/>
former duties, but with her soul purified and <reg orig="en-|lightened">enlightened</reg> <lb/>
by the furnace of sorrow through which <lb/>
she had passed, receiving God's poor as a legacy to <lb/>
watch and cherish; not morbid in grief, but <reg orig="accept-|ing">accepting</reg> <lb/>
all the consolations which were left to her; nor <lb/>
narrow in religion and prone to refuse God's other <lb/>
gifts, but joyfully receiving all&mdash;books, art, music, <lb/>
and above all, the beauties and pleasures of nature&mdash; <lb/>
as helps, not hindrances, in her path. Those who <lb/>
did not know her thought that her great deprivation <lb/>
had shut out from her the light of life; but this was <lb/>
not so. Day by day, as she drank at the fount of all <lb/>
true happiness, she imbibed not only the spirit of trust, <lb/>
but of peace and perfect dependence. In the <reg orig="com-|panionship">companionship</reg> <lb/>
of her brother-in-law and his curate, John <lb/>
Sterling, ten years were speedily passed. With the <lb/>
great library owned by Julius, she had the <reg orig="opportu-|nity">opportunity</reg> <lb/>
of cultivating the acquaintance of the best authors <lb/>
of all countries. "But," she frequently remarked, <lb/>
<pb n="359" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0366"/>
"there are many days when nothing but the <hi rend="italic">one</hi> Book <lb/>
will satisfy, and I get on slowly with anything else. <lb/>
I feel persuaded the more we leave that as our chief <lb/>
food, the more we become unspiritualized; and <reg orig="per-|haps">perhaps</reg> <lb/>
this is the reason so many real Christians in <lb/>
these days of religious books are so little spiritual." <lb/>
Upon another occasion she wrote in her note-book: <lb/>
"When, from outward circumstances or inward <reg orig="tem-|perament">temperament</reg>, <lb/>
the Bible is the main food of my mind <lb/>
through the day, and the other supply of <reg orig="intel-|lectual">intellectual</reg> <lb/>
nourishment is but the garnish, as it were, <lb/>
to this chief dish,&mdash;or, to borrow an image from <lb/>
music, when God's word is the air and man's word <lb/>
only the accompaniment,&mdash;my soul is kept in <reg orig="per-|fect">perfect</reg> <lb/>
peace; it feels as if all were in its right place <lb/>
and fitting proportion. When, on the contrary, from <lb/>
hindrances from without or within, this is not so, <lb/>
and the wisdom of man is most prominently brought <lb/>
before me, and that of God thrown into the distance, <lb/>
I feel ill at ease, and my mind tossed to and fro <lb/>
without stay or peace."</p>
<p>Much of her time was spent in contemplation and <lb/>
prayer. A green alley, which divided the garden <lb/>
from the field, came to be called her "prayer walk." <lb/>
Here it was that she held communion with her heavenly <lb/>
Father, and sought that spiritual consolation which <lb/>
enabled her patiently to wait and learn her Master's <lb/>
will. "In the wealth of God's love to me, his poor <lb/>
servant," she wrote, "while he has taken away that <lb/>
<pb n="360" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0367"/>
which held me too fast bound to the creature, he has <lb/>
given me anew all that it is possible for me rightly <lb/>
to enjoy, and made the earnest desire of my heart <lb/>
to long after that which would be to the praise of <lb/>
his glory. 'Lord, teach me judgment and <reg orig="know-|ledge">knowledge</reg>.' <lb/>
This is my constant prayer. I know not <lb/>
how to guide my household aright, how to train up <lb/>
my child in the way he should go, how to draw my <lb/>
dearest Julius in fellowship of spirit with his God <lb/>
and mine. Let this threefold duty be made plain to <lb/>
me&mdash;so plain that I may not err in it; and <reg orig="what-|ever">whatever</reg> <lb/>
may be the cost, oh! may the spirit of Jesus <lb/>
reign in me till every selfish aim and purpose is <lb/>
rooted out, every unkind and severe judgment, every <lb/>
unloving thought displaced, and perfect love and <lb/>
perfect purity wrought in my heart."</p>
<p>After reading the words, "They seemed to him but <lb/>
a few days, for the love he bore to her," she wrote: <lb/>
"O that such a love as this might fill my heart to <lb/>
Him who has so loved me, that the years of my <reg orig="pil-|grimage">pilgrimage</reg> <lb/>
might, like those of Jacob's servitude, seem <lb/>
but a few days for the love I bear to Jesus, my <lb/>
Lord and my God! And so they would, if the soul could <lb/>
ever be kept at the height of spiritual joy and peace <lb/>
to which it pleases God occasionally to raise it; but, <lb/>
alas! it so cleaves to earth, and earth so encompasses <lb/>
it about, that without a life of abstraction from the <lb/>
world and man, it is hard to preserve the freshness <lb/>
of an ever-flowing fountain of love able to swallow <lb/>
<pb n="361" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0368"/>
up the polluted streams that are constantly pouring <lb/>
into it."</p>
<p>Many beautiful thoughts and pious reflections were <lb/>
daily recorded in Mrs. Hare's "Green Book," <reg orig="breath-|ing">breathing</reg> <lb/>
the spirit of prayer and holy communion with <lb/>
God. Here is one of her diary records: "The <reg orig="intel-|lect">intellect</reg> <lb/>
is a rich gift, and one for which we are specially <lb/>
responsible. It ministers above all others to God's <lb/>
glory, by promoting the good of men and affording <lb/>
variety of means to meet the various wants of human <lb/>
nature. But my heart is so selfish that I often feel <lb/>
disposed to envy those who have less in this way to <lb/>
answer for; who can maintain that more simple and <lb/>
constant communion with God which the exercise of <lb/>
the mind seems often to hinder and drive away. In <lb/>
the first days of my spiritual joy and peace, it was <lb/>
that <hi rend="italic">direct</hi> looking to God and living by faith that <lb/>
influenced my first waking thoughts, my latest <lb/>
night ones: the first moment of consciousness my <lb/>
heart sprung up to heaven in thankful joy, words <lb/>
seemed to be called up without effort out of <reg orig="Scrip-|ture">Scripture</reg> <lb/>
or from hymns; and before I fell asleep at <lb/>
night I felt quite unwilling to lose in forgetfulness <lb/>
the sense of my Saviour's presence."</p>
<p>But Mrs. Hare's acknowledgment of her Saviour's <lb/>
love was manifested, not only in prayer and praise, <lb/>
but in active duties. "Each morning, as soon as <lb/>
breakfast was over," writes her adopted son, "would <lb/>
my mother cross the high field, with its wide view <lb/>
<pb n="362" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0369"/>
over level and sea, and then follow the oak-fringed <lb/>
lane to the girls' school, where she taught her <reg orig="chil-|dren&mdash;always">children&mdash;always</reg> <lb/>
gladly welcomed by them, from the <lb/>
interest she contrived to throw into the most <reg orig="ordi-|nary">ordinary</reg> <lb/>
lesson; often enlivening her instructions with <lb/>
stories of things she had seen or read of, or simple <lb/>
facts of natural history. Each village girl saw in <lb/>
her one who was as necessary a part of her home as <lb/>
the members of her own family&mdash;one to whom all <lb/>
her family relationships and domestic concerns were <lb/>
familiar, and who cared for each individually. When <lb/>
any were sick or sorry, it was their 'lady' they <lb/>
wished to see; if any prosperity befell them, they <lb/>
hastened to tell her of it; and at their little festivals, <lb/>
especially that of the 1st of May, nothing was <reg orig="con-|sidered">considered</reg> <lb/>
complete unless their dear lady was there, <lb/>
sitting under the laburnum trees in the little <reg orig="school-|court">school-court</reg>, <lb/>
enjoying all with them."</p>
<p>But all seasons were to her incentives and <reg orig="remem-|brances">remembrances</reg>. <lb/>
Christmas brought heart-rejoicing in all <lb/>
its sacred associations. In the Easter season her <lb/>
inward spiritual life seemed to overflow. No <lb/>
Christian season was a name to Mrs. Hare; all <lb/>
were burning, glowing realities. From childhood <lb/>
to old age, the key-note of her life, the main-spring <lb/>
of her every act, was love&mdash;love to God, love to God's <lb/>
poor, love to her family; love which by the rubs and <lb/>
pressure of the world was never ruffled, because no <lb/>
injury could irritate her who had always forgiven <lb/>
<pb n="363" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0370"/>
beforehand, and who always thought all others better, <lb/>
so much better, than herself.</p>
<p>In one of her letters to her adopted son she gave <lb/>
him admirable advice relative to his studies, which <lb/>
has a wider and more deserved interest than its first <lb/>
intention and object. "In two days more," she wrote, <lb/>
"you will be sixteen years old. I can scarcely believe <lb/>
that my dear little child, who used to run by my side <lb/>
and play with the flowers he had gathered, is indeed <lb/>
approaching manhood. You are now old enough to <lb/>
seek after knowledge for knowledge's sake; and <lb/>
desire to learn correctly and <hi rend="italic">solidly</hi> what you can. <lb/>
A mere smattering of knowledge is worth nothing; <lb/>
and I hope my Augustus will be something more than <lb/>
a mere <foreign lang="ita"><hi rend="italic">dilettante</hi></foreign>, one who only skims over the <reg orig="sur-|face">surface</reg> <lb/>
of learning, picking out that part which is <lb/>
pleasant or agreeable, and leaving out the rest. In <lb/>
everything there must be pains and labour taken to <lb/>
master the difficulties and acquire the uninteresting <lb/>
and dry part, which may be called the <hi rend="italic">bones</hi> of the <lb/>
system, whatever it is. There may be taste and <lb/>
beauty in a drawing, but if the perspective be faulty <lb/>
and the lines crooked, it cannot be really well done. <lb/>
So it is in languages: there may be pleasure in the <lb/>
writings of poets or historians, but numberless errors <lb/>
will be made in translation, as in composition, if there <lb/>
is no accurate knowledge of the grammar. And it is <lb/>
not only because of the <hi rend="italic">attainments</hi> of study that it <lb/>
is needful to be diligent, but because it is only through <lb/>
<pb n="364" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0371"/>
this discipline of mind that the character can be <lb/>
formed rightly, and the extravagances of imagination <lb/>
so sobered that one can see things truly and <reg orig="accu-|rately">accurately</reg>. <lb/>
In a Life of Socrates which I have been <lb/>
reading, it is mentioned that the great business of <lb/>
Socrates was in public speeches to convince the people <lb/>
that they had 'a conceit of knowledge instead of the <lb/>
reality;' and this is exactly what you will find to be <lb/>
your case by discovering, as you learn more, that as <lb/>
yet you know only the outside and superficial part."</p>
<p>In 1852 Mrs. Hare met with an accident in her <lb/>
garden which necessitated a long confinement, and <lb/>
which laid the foundation of an after-life of ill-health. <lb/>
The illness to which she was subject was very singular. <lb/>
It was not accompanied with any acute pain, but a <lb/>
general oppression, deafness, and trembling in every <lb/>
limb followed any exposure to cold or damp. When <lb/>
mentally disturbed, complete unconsciousness would <lb/>
ensue, and she would remain entirely insensible, icily <lb/>
cold, neither heart nor pulse seeming to beat, for many <lb/>
hours together, in which, to all appearance, life was <lb/>
totally extinct. Upon one occasion she remained in <lb/>
this state for sixty hours; then, after a brief recovery, <lb/>
she relapsed into a second trance of a hundred and <lb/>
twelve hours; and this was succeeded by a third trance <lb/>
condition of twenty-six hours! At other times she <lb/>
would lie in a state of "waking coma," unconscious to <lb/>
outward things, "hearing the angels singing to her, <lb/>
and wandering mentally amid scenes of unfathomable <lb/>
<pb n="365" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0372"/>
beauty. Her visions never took any form but those <lb/>
of loveliness, her impressions never breathed anything <lb/>
but peace." During the time she remained in these <lb/>
trance states "a serene peace overshadowed her, a <lb/>
heavenly sweetness filled her face, and never varied, <lb/>
except to dimple into smiles of angelic beauty, as if <lb/>
she were already in the company of the angels; and, <lb/>
indeed, perhaps she was: for 'I have not been alone' <lb/>
were her first words on awaking; 'your Uncle Penrhyn <lb/>
and Aunt K<gap desc="long dash" reason="missing" id="g4"/> have been with me.'</p>
<p>Owing to Mrs. Hare's susceptibility to cold, it was <lb/>
resolved, in 1857, that she should spend a lengthened <lb/>
period abroad. She had for her companions her <lb/>
adopted son and Miss Leycester. The travellers, <lb/>
during their sixteen months' absence from England, <lb/>
visited the Italian lakes, all the principal cities in <lb/>
Lombardy and upon the Italian coast of the Adriatic, <lb/>
reaching Rome in November. The following spring <lb/>
was spent at Naples and Amalfi, and the summer in <lb/>
the lovely green valley of the Baths of Lucca; and <lb/>
then in October, after spending some time in the <lb/>
Protestant valleys of the Vaudois, by the Simplon <lb/>
and Lake of Geneva, the travellers turned their steps <lb/>
homeward. The result of the journey upon Mrs. <lb/>
Hare's health was all that could be desired, as she <lb/>
wrote: "I went out weak, I have returned strong;" <lb/>
and then added, "Now that I am again restored to <lb/>
home life, to quiet and unexciting occupations, oh, be <lb/>
with me, my Lord and God, and help me to build up <lb/>
<pb n="366" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0373"/>
my soul anew in heavenly desires, to spend and be <lb/>
spent once more in thy service, breaking through the <lb/>
reserve that has crept over me, and endeavouring to <lb/>
help all within my reach in their heavenward course." <lb/>
"It is one of the blessings of home, that one can show <lb/>
some little love-tokens, speak some words of sympathy <lb/>
and comfort, which elsewhere would find no object."</p>
<p>The patience and resignation of Mrs. Hare received <lb/>
a severe trial in the year 1859, when the frauds and <lb/>
defalcations of the family solicitor, and the almost <lb/>
total ruin of the Hare family, became known. Mrs. <lb/>
Hare's losses, although considerable, were much less <lb/>
than those of other members of the family. It was the <lb/>
source of much pleasure and gratitude that she was <lb/>
enabled to minister to their wants, which she did with <lb/>
delight. Her thoughts upon the distressing loss she <lb/>
recorded in her diary: "One sad cloud has dimmed <lb/>
our path. The distress which the wicked treachery <lb/>
of one man has inflicted on so many near to us has <lb/>
been an anxiety and sorrow which still presses on us <lb/>
heavily. Still, though arising out of sin, we ought <lb/>
to carry it to God, and ask that out of evil good may <lb/>
come; that increasing faith, humility, and love may <lb/>
spring up in the trial. Lord, make crooked things <lb/>
straight, disperse the clouds of prejudice and error <lb/>
which gather round those I love, show them the right <lb/>
way; and while I see and lament their faults, let me <lb/>
not overlook my own,&mdash;'Be gentle to others, and <lb/>
severe towards thyself.'"</p>

<p>Owing to the home at Hurstmonceaux being sold, <lb/>
Mrs. Hare had to seek a new residence in 1860, and <lb/>
was enabled, fortunately, to secure a little property <lb/>
near Hastings. Holmhurst then became the home of <lb/>
her last years. But quiet and pleasant and <reg orig="beauti-|fully">beautifully</reg> <lb/>
situated as it was, it failed to bring back the <lb/>
health of former years or to prevent attacks of serious <lb/>
illness. Very soon after the new home had been <lb/>
entered, foreign travel, which had ever been <reg orig="bene-|ficial">beneficial</reg> <lb/>
to Mrs. Hare, had again to be undertaken&mdash;not <lb/>
so much a pleasure as a duty. The winter of 1861 <lb/>
was spent at Mentone&mdash;Orleans, Bourges, Avignon, <lb/>
N&Icirc;mes, and Arles having been visited on the way. <lb/>
The autumn and winter of 1862 were spent at <reg orig="Holm-|hurst">Holmhurst</reg> <lb/>
in great suffering; in the spring of 1863 a <lb/>
foreign journey was again undertaken. Several <lb/>
months were passed at Nice, Mentone, Geneva, and <lb/>
Thun. The winter of 1863&ndash;64 was spent in Rome. <lb/>
"Many quiet days," wrote Augustus, in his admirable <lb/>
memoir of his mother, "alone with my mother amid <lb/>
Roman ruins and gardens, when her gentle presence, <lb/>
when the very thought of her loved existence, made <lb/>
all things beautiful and lovely to the companion of <lb/>
her life." Other journeys, after returning to <reg orig="Holm-|hurst">Holmhurst</reg>, <lb/>
had to be undertaken, during which she had <lb/>
frequent relapses into the trance state, in which she <lb/>
had delightful visions of those who had gone before <lb/>
to their heavenly home. Another journey was <lb/>
undertaken to Rome, to spend the winter of 1867, <lb/>
<pb n="368" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0375"/>
which was marked by a terrible accident&mdash;the horses <lb/>
taking fright at some navvies emerging with torches <lb/>
at night from a half-completed tunnel near Sestri, <lb/>
dashing up a bank, and throwing the carriage over <lb/>
from the rocks by the side of the road. Fortunately, <lb/>
although the carriage was broken to pieces, its <reg orig="in-|mates">inmates</reg> <lb/>
escaped without injury. But the severe shock <lb/>
manifested itself in the great weakness which <reg orig="super-|vened">supervened</reg> <lb/>
on the travellers reaching Rome, when Mrs. <lb/>
Hare was not able to move from one chair to another. <lb/>
Great fears were entertained that she would never <lb/>
again reach Holmhurst. She had no fear, however: <lb/>
the near prospect of death was the near prospect of <lb/>
life, eternal life, with those who had gone before. <lb/>
Fortunately, she rallied sufficiently to enable her to <lb/>
reach home once more, and to take her usual interest <lb/>
in the well-being of those about her. Again, <reg orig="how-|ever">however</reg>, <lb/>
in 1869, another journey to Italy was <reg orig="under-|taken">undertaken</reg>. <lb/>
When at Pisa a catastrophe occurred which <lb/>
detained the travellers for many weeks. Owing to <lb/>
continuous rains, the Arno swelled into a sea, flooding <lb/>
the lower rooms of the hotel in which Mrs. Hare and <lb/>
her son were staying, and throwing down the walls <lb/>
of the houses, as if another deluge were about to <lb/>
swallow all living creatures. Fearful were the scenes <lb/>
and dreadful the ruin which this awful flood <reg orig="occa-|sioned">occasioned</reg>. <lb/>
Numbers of the poorest inhabitants perished <lb/>
in their dwellings.</p>
<pb n="369" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0376"/>
<p>Notwithstanding the great fright which the flood <lb/>
occasioned Mrs. Hare, she was enabled to reach Rome <lb/>
by the railway, which was almost entirely covered <lb/>
with water. But, as disasters are said never to come <lb/>
alone, on the third day after arriving Mrs. Hare had <lb/>
a terrible fall, which stunned her at the time, and <lb/>
from which she never recovered. This was succeeded <lb/>
by a slight paralytic attack, and six days after by a <lb/>
more severe one, which prevented her from walking <lb/>
or using her left side or arm again. But for the <lb/>
intervening months before departing for England <lb/>
peace and quiet resignation were her constant <reg orig="pos-|session">possession</reg>; <lb/>
and on the journey home only expressions of <lb/>
thankfulness escaped her lips.</p>
<p>But the end was nearing fast, and when it did <lb/>
come, it came not unwelcomed, and as Mrs. Hare <lb/>
desired&mdash;in her own home at Holmhurst, surrounded <lb/>
by her weeping servants and those she so much <lb/>
loved. Her son said: "My mother, whose eyes <lb/>
were fast closing, fixed them upon me with a long, <lb/>
long farewell look, of her own unfathomable, <reg orig="unsur-|passable">unsurpassable</reg> <lb/>
love; then turning to Lea, then again to <lb/>
me; and then, as I rung the bell at my elbow, and her <lb/>
other faithful servants in answer passed sobbing into <lb/>
the room and stood at the foot of the bed, my darling, <lb/>
my most precious mother, gently, very gently, with a <lb/>
lovely expression of intense beatitude fixed on <reg orig="some-|thing">something</reg> <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">beyond</hi> us, gently sighed away her spirit in my <lb/>
arms." And now, as he wrote,&mdash; <lb/>
<pb n="370" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0377"/>
<q><lg type="stanza">
<l>"Day after day we think what she is doing</l>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Youth</hi>, surely, is the glow, the warmth, as <lb/>
it is the outburst, of existence. It is full <lb/>
of promise as of opportunities. And yet, <lb/>
possibly owing to the too sanguine <reg orig="ex-|pectation">expectation</reg> <lb/>
which is natural to youth, disappointment <lb/>
and mortification must be the frequent experience. <lb/>
It is only as we advance in life, and learn from <lb/>
its experience, that we are able to limit our <reg orig="de-|sires">desires</reg> <lb/>
to the possibilities of existence, and to wish <lb/>
and desire no more pleasures than we can obtain. <lb/>
But before we attain to this experience and become <lb/>
sober, not sad, in our daily deportment and daily life, <lb/>
we have the glorious season of youth in which to <lb/>
disport ourselves, which seems never to have an <lb/>
end.</p>
<pb n="372" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0379"/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l rend="indent">"Lusty youth</l>
<l>In the very May-morn of delight,</l>
<l>When boldest floods are full of wilful heat,</l>
<l>And joy to think how long they have to fight</l>
<l>In fancy's field, before their life take flight</l>
<l>Since he which latest did the game begin,</l>
<l>Doth longest hope to linger still therein."</l>
</lg></q>
<p>The "wise saws and modern instances" which are <lb/>
quoted for the guidance and instruction of youth are <lb/>
probably remembered when youth is past&mdash;when <lb/>
the opportunity of putting them to use is gone; but <lb/>
rarely are they considered when "the time of our <lb/>
youth" would have brought the seed to flower, and <lb/>
a golden life, full of use and service, would have <lb/>
culminated a life of youthful promise. Amongst the <lb/>
best sayings of the wise and the good, the words of <lb/>
Sir Walter Raleigh stand foremost: "Bestow thy <lb/>
youth so that thou mayest have comfort to remember <lb/>
it when it hath forsaken thee, and not sigh and grieve <lb/>
at the account thereof. Whilst thou art young, thou <lb/>
wilt think it will never have an end; but behold, the <lb/>
longest day hath its evening, and that thou shalt <lb/>
enjoy it but once, that it never turns again; use it, <lb/>
therefore, as the spring-time, which soon departeth, <lb/>
and wherein thou oughtest to plant and sow all <reg orig="pro-|visions">provisions</reg> <lb/>
for a long and happy life."</p>
<p>But if youth will not care for proverbs and fables <lb/>
and maxims; if it will not of its own accord seek <lb/>
wisdom and find it, there is one gentle hand&mdash;the <lb/>
hand of woman&mdash;to lead, guard, and direct. Had it <lb/>
not been for the ministering of many a dear mother <lb/>
<pb n="373" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0380"/>
and sympathizing sister, some of the most glorious <lb/>
names on the roll of fame would not have been there. <lb/>
Many a man who has attained eminence among his <lb/>
fellows, and who will remain for all time as a mark <lb/>
of attained ability and professional eminence, owes <lb/>
his position to his mother&mdash;his mother! sweetest <lb/>
name on earth! Every sentence she uttered, every <lb/>
action she performed had its impress, and moulded <lb/>
the character of her son; even the tone of her voice <lb/>
and the glance of her eye had an influence and left <lb/>
an impression. It cannot be doubted but that Dr. <lb/>
Channing owed much of the tone of his character to <lb/>
his mother, of whom he thus wrote: "The most <lb/>
remarkable trait was the rectitude and simplicity of <lb/>
her mind. She was true in thought, word, and life. <lb/>
She had the firmness to see the truth, to speak it, to <lb/>
act upon it. She was direct in judgment and <reg orig="con-|versation">conversation</reg>, <lb/>
and in my long intercourse with her I <lb/>
cannot recollect one word or action betraying the <lb/>
slightest insincerity." This truthfulness of his mother <lb/>
induced genuineness in her son. This was seen upon <lb/>
one occasion when he was taken by his father to hear <lb/>
a celebrated preacher. The sermon was very <reg orig="impres-|sive">impressive</reg>; <lb/>
man's sinful and hopeless condition by nature <lb/>
was truthfully displayed, and the hearers were <lb/>
earnestly exhorted to flee to Christ as the only way <lb/>
of salvation. The boy listened with feelings of <lb/>
reverence and awe, and thought that all who believed <lb/>
the words of the preacher, after having been warned <lb/>
<pb n="374" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0381"/>
of their danger, would at once leave the business and <lb/>
pleasures which before had engrossed their attention, <lb/>
and gladly avail themselves of the offered means of <lb/>
escape. "It is all true," was the child's inward <reg orig="re-|flection">reflection</reg>, <lb/>
as with bursting heart he took his seat in the <lb/>
chaise that conveyed them home. He wanted to talk <lb/>
to his father on the subject of the sermon, but natural <lb/>
timidity kept him silent. Presently his father began <lb/>
to whistle; and when they reached home, instead of <lb/>
calling his family about him and telling them the <lb/>
awful truths which had formed the subject of the <lb/>
sermon, he threw himself with a newspaper into his <lb/>
easy chair! The boy was amazed. Did the preacher <lb/>
tell the truth? Could he have told the truth? It <lb/>
was clear by the action of his father that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> did not <lb/>
believe the preacher. At length he came to the <reg orig="con-|clusion">conclusion</reg> <lb/>
that he had been deceived&mdash;that the preacher <lb/>
had told them a tale in which there was no truth. <lb/>
How different, however, were the preaching and the <lb/>
practice of his mother! She was not less true in <lb/>
word than true in deed. The lesson she gave, the <lb/>
precept, was followed by example. The lesson of her <lb/>
life was truth, probity, and sincerity. Was it strange <lb/>
that the son, so admirably influenced and taught at <lb/>
home, was through life the reflex and embodiment of <lb/>
honour; and that America proudly names amongst <lb/>
its most distinguished sons the name of Dr. Channing?</p>
<p>Philip Henry, the father of the celebrated Matthew <lb/>
Henry, the commentator, was indebted to his mother <lb/>
<pb n="375" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0382"/>
for much of his character, and the influence which <lb/>
he afterwards exercised as a preacher. Mrs. Henry <lb/>
is described as "a virtuous, pious gentlewoman, and <lb/>
one that feared God above many." Her husband was <lb/>
engaged as orchard-keeper at Whitehall Palace, and <lb/>
they were thus brought into contact with much of the <lb/>
court life of Charles I. The contrast of their humble <lb/>
home and the gaieties which surrounded them was <lb/>
most striking. The temptations and pleasures of the <lb/>
court, however, had no allurements for Mrs. Henry. <lb/>
Her affections and wishes were bounded by her <reg orig="hus-|band">husband</reg> <lb/>
and her children; between her God and them <lb/>
she divided her whole heart. Her plan of sowing <lb/>
good seed in the minds of her children was to give <lb/>
them daily instruction in the Scriptures, and <reg orig="accom-|panying">accompanying</reg> <lb/>
them to God's house, where God's truth was <lb/>
faithfully expounded. Philip had need, as he often <lb/>
did, to thank God for such a mother. "If ever any <lb/>
child," he said, "enjoyed line upon line, and precept <lb/>
upon precept, I did. And was it in vain? I trust <lb/>
not altogether in vain. My soul rejoiceth and is <lb/>
glad at the remembrance of it: the word distilled as <lb/>
the dew and dropped as the rain; I loved it, and <lb/>
loved the messengers of it&mdash;their feet were beautiful <lb/>
to me. And, Lord, what a mercy was it that at a <lb/>
time when the poor counties were laid waste, when <lb/>
the noise of drums and trumpets and the clattering <lb/>
of arms were heard, and the ways of Sion mourned, <lb/>
that then my lot should be where there was peace <lb/>
<pb n="376" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0383"/>
and quietness, where the voice of the turtle was <lb/>
heard, and where there was plenty of gospel <reg orig="oppor-|tunities">opportunities</reg>. <lb/>
Had it been only the restraint that it laid <lb/>
upon me whereby I was kept from the common sins <lb/>
of other children and youths, such as cursing, <reg orig="swear-|ing">swearing</reg>, <lb/>
Sabbath-breaking, and the like, I were bound <lb/>
to be very thankful; but that it prevailed, through <lb/>
grace, effectually to bring me to God, how much am <lb/>
I indebted? and what shall I render?"</p>
<p>The good mother of Philip, in influencing her son, <lb/>
influenced her grandson, and was thus the means of <lb/>
blessing and enriching the world. It is not too much <lb/>
to say that had she not exercised herself in the <lb/>
religious culture of her son, cared for his morals and <lb/>
his piety, Matthew Henry's Commentary upon the <lb/>
Holy Scriptures&mdash;a monument of learning and <reg orig="sanc-|tified">sanctified</reg> <lb/>
labour&mdash;would not have been written. Well <lb/>
might she say, just before her spirit took its departure, <lb/>
"My head is in heaven, and my heart is in heaven; it <lb/>
is but one step more and I shall be there too."</p>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"She died as Christians die;</l>
<l>There was no earthward struggle of the soul,</l>
<l>No shuddering terror, no reluctant sigh.</l>
<l>They who beheld her dying fear not death:</l>
<l>Silently, silently the spoiler came,</l>
<l>As sleep steals o'er the senses unperceived,</l>
<l>And the last thoughts which cheer the waking hours</l>
<l>Mingle with our sweet dreams."</l>
</lg></q>
<p>But if Matthew Henry was blessed through the <lb/>
excellence of his grandmother, he was directly <reg orig="in-|fluenced">influenced</reg> <lb/>
by his mother, Mrs. Philip Henry, who was <lb/>
<pb n="377" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0384"/>
a quiet, gentle woman, whose virtues and excellences <lb/>
shone the brightest at home. She was much <reg orig="cele-|brated">celebrated</reg> <lb/>
for the virtues of order and hospitality. Her <lb/>
son Matthew gives a beautiful glimpse of his home <lb/>
and the home-life of his parents. After speaking of <lb/>
his father's observance of the duty of secret prayer, <lb/>
he says: "Besides this, he and his wife constantly <lb/>
prayed together, morning and evening; and never, if <lb/>
they were together, at home or abroad, was it <reg orig="inter-|mitted">intermitted</reg>. <lb/>
After family worship, all the children on <lb/>
bended knee asked a blessing of their parents,&mdash;that <lb/>
is, desired of them to pray to God to bless them,&mdash; <lb/>
which blessing was given with great solemnity and <lb/>
affection; and if any were absent they were <reg orig="remem-|bered">remembered</reg>." <lb/>
It is not wonderful that every child of these <lb/>
excellent people became true Christians. When they <lb/>
all grew up and removed to homes of their own, <lb/>
Philip Henry and his wife took charge of several <lb/>
orphans and other children, being anxious that they <lb/>
should be brought under the influence of Christian <lb/>
example and education. "We must be doing <reg orig="some-|thing">something</reg> <lb/>
in the world," said Philip, "while we are in it."</p>
<q><lg type="group">
<l rend="indent">"O sacred stream of love,</l>
<l rend="indent2">Hast thou begun thy flow,</l>
<l rend="indent">And from the hills above</l>
<l rend="indent2">Reached now the lands below?</l>
<l>Then, bless'd by thee, life's common field</l>
<l>Will corn and fruit and herbage yield."</l>
</lg></q>
<p>We do not know much of the mother of the <reg orig="cele-|brated">celebrated</reg> <lb/>
Dr. Watts, but what we do know is that she <lb/>
<pb n="378" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0385"/>
was a strong-minded and self-possessed woman. Her <lb/>
husband was several times confined in jail on account <lb/>
of his religious principles. During these periods of <lb/>
incarceration, Mrs. Watts might frequently be seen <lb/>
with her son Isaac in her arms sitting at the door of <lb/>
the prison. She early discovered the genius of her <lb/>
son, and lent the whole force of her character to its <lb/>
development. To her encouragement of his poetical <lb/>
abilities the world is indebted for the noble <reg orig="contribu-|tion">contribution</reg> <lb/>
to religious worship of his psalms and hymns, <lb/>
which have inspired tens of thousands of believers; <lb/>
and which will, while the service of song is observed <lb/>
in the sanctuary, be a treasured compendium of pure <lb/>
praise and prayer.</p>
<p>The world owes to Mrs. Samuel Wesley the useful <lb/>
lives of John and Charles Wesley. They received <lb/>
from her, in the admirable regularity and the piety <lb/>
and devotion of her life, that stimulus and incentive <lb/>
which, under the blessing of God, were productive <lb/>
of so much spiritual good. Soon after Susannah <lb/>
Annesley became the wife of the Rev. Samuel <lb/>
Wesley, rector of Epworth in Lincolnshire, she <lb/>
resolved to spend one hour night and morning, and <lb/>
as often as possible another hour at noon, in prayer; <lb/>
and only illness or urgent duty was allowed to <lb/>
interfere with these pious exercises. But this large <lb/>
portion of time was not permitted to interfere with <lb/>
the concerns of her family. Out of nineteen <reg orig="chil-|dren">children</reg> <lb/>
ten lived and received from her the elements of <lb/>
<pb n="379" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0386"/>
their education. She was accustomed to say that <lb/>
God had committed the precious souls of her <reg orig="chil-|dren">children</reg> <lb/>
to her care, and that none but a mother could <lb/>
discharge the trust faithfully. None of her <reg orig="chil-|dren">children</reg> <lb/>
were taught to read until they were five years <lb/>
old. When that age was attained, the little one <lb/>
was taken into the schoolroom from nine until <lb/>
twelve, and from two until five; and no one was <lb/>
permitted to interrupt the course of instruction. <lb/>
During the first day all the children, with the <reg orig="ex-|ception">exception</reg> <lb/>
of two of the girls, learned the alphabet <reg orig="per-|fectly">perfectly</reg>. <lb/>
The two girls took a day and a half to <reg orig="com-|plete">complete</reg> <lb/>
the task.</p>
<p>When John Wesley was in his eighth year, his <lb/>
mother wrote the following prayer and resolution: <lb/>
"I will offer myself, and all that Thou hast given me; <lb/>
and I will resolve&mdash;oh, give me grace to do it&mdash;that <lb/>
the residue of my life shall be all devoted to Thy <lb/>
service. And I do intend to be more <hi rend="italic">particularly</hi> <lb/>
careful of the soul of this child, that Thou hast so <lb/>
mercifully provided for, than ever I have been, that <lb/>
I may do my endeavours to instil into his mind the <lb/>
principles of true religion and virtue. Lord, give me <lb/>
grace to do it sincerely and prudently, and bless my <lb/>
attempts with good success." This excellent woman <lb/>
lived to see her sons all become useful servants in <lb/>
Christ's kingdom; and when her husband died, she <lb/>
divided her time between her children, attending <lb/>
the ministry of one or other of her sons. Well might <lb/>
<pb n="380" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0387"/>
those sons, when their excellent mother was taken <lb/>
away, inscribe upon her tombstone:&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"In sure and steadfast hope to rise,</l>
<l>And claim her mansion in the skies;</l>
<l>A Christian here, her flesh laid down,</l>
<l>The cross exchanging for a crown."</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>The influence of a mother upon her son was well <lb/>
exemplified in the experience of the Rev. Richard <lb/>
Cecil, who at one period of his life was accustomed <lb/>
occasionally to treat sacred things with great levity; <lb/>
and yet, as he confessed, never without a compunctious <lb/>
and sorrowful feeling. He could not forget his <lb/>
mother and her teaching. One night he began to <reg orig="in-|quire">inquire</reg> <lb/>
what powerful principle it was that could so <lb/>
affect the mind as to give peace in a time of <lb/>
trouble. "I see," he said, "two unquestionable <lb/>
facts: First, My mother is greatly afflicted in <reg orig="cir-|cumstances">circumstances</reg>, <lb/>
body and mind; and yet I see that she <lb/>
cheerfully bears up under all, by the support that <lb/>
she derives from constantly retiring to her closet <lb/>
and her Bible. Secondly, That she has a secret <lb/>
spring of comfort, of which I know nothing; while <lb/>
I, who give an unbounded loose to my appetites, <lb/>
and seek pleasure by every means, seldom or never <lb/>
find it. If, however, there is any such secret in <lb/>
religion, why may not I attain it as well as my <lb/>
mother? I will immediately seek it of God." <lb/>
Soon the scoffer became the earnest Christian and <lb/>
then the faithful minister; thus in his life <reg orig="answer-|ing">answering</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="381" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0388"/>
the prayers and exhortations of his pious <lb/>
mother.</p>
<p>The famous Rev Legh Richmond gives similar <lb/>
testimony of the interest and influence of his mother. <lb/>
"I well remember," he says, "in the early dawn of <lb/>
my expanding reason, with what care she laboured to <lb/>
instil into my mind a sense of the being of God, and <lb/>
the reverence which is due to him; of the character <lb/>
of a Saviour, and his infinite merits; of the duty of <lb/>
prayer, and the manner in which it ought to be <lb/>
offered up at the throne of grace. Her way of <lb/>
enforcing these subjects was like one who felt their <lb/>
importance, and wished her child to do so likewise. <lb/>
First instructed by her to read, I have not forgotten <lb/>
in my Bible lessons with what simplicity and <reg orig="pro-|priety">propriety</reg> <lb/>
she used to explain and comment on the Word <lb/>
of God, its precepts and examples. These infantine <lb/>
catechetical exercises still vibrate in my recollection, <lb/>
and confirm to my own mind the great advantage <lb/>
attendant upon the earliest possible endeavours to <lb/>
win the attention and store the memory with <lb/>
religious knowledge. Her natural abilities enabled <lb/>
her to converse with a very little child with much <lb/>
effect; and there was a tenderness of affection, united <lb/>
to a firmness of manner, which greatly promoted the <lb/>
best interests of a nursery education."</p>
<p>Cowper says of his mother: "While I live I must <lb/>
regret a comfort of which I was deprived so early. <lb/>
I may truly say that not a week passes &lpar;perhaps I <lb/>
<pb n="382" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0389"/>
might with equal veracity say a day&rpar; in which I do <lb/>
not think of her; such was the impression her <reg orig="ten-|derness">tenderness</reg> <lb/>
made upon me, though the opportunity for <lb/>
showing it was so short. But the ways of the Lord <lb/>
are equal; and when I reflect upon the pangs she <lb/>
would have suffered had she been a witness of all <lb/>
mine, I see more cause to rejoice than to mourn that <lb/>
she was hidden in the grave so soon." Strong and <lb/>
revered must the memory of that mother have been, <lb/>
when, upon the occasion of his cousin presenting <lb/>
him with his mother's picture, he said: "I had rather <lb/>
possess that picture than the richest jewel in the <lb/>
British crown; for I loved her with an affection that <lb/>
her death, fifty-two years since, has not in the least <lb/>
abated." Lovingly he wrote:&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"My boast is not that I deduce my birth</l>
<l>From loins enthroned, and rulers of the earth;</l>
<l>But higher far my proud pretensions rise&mdash;</l>
<l>The son of parents passed into the skies!</l>
<l>And now, farewell&mdash;Time unrevoked has run</l>
<l>His wonted course, yet what I wished is done.</l>
<l>By Contemplation's help, not sought in vain,</l>
<l>I seem to have lived my childhood o'er again;</l>
<l>To have renewed the joys that once were mine,</l>
<l>Without the sin of violating thine:</l>
<l>And while the wings of Fancy still are free,</l>
<l>And I can view this mimic show of thee,</l>
<l>Time has but half succeeded in his theft&mdash;</l>
<l>Thyself removed, thy power to soothe me left."</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>The excellent philanthropist Oberlin attributed <lb/>
his love for things excellent and his usefulness to <lb/>
the early and loving instruction of his mother. <lb/>
Through life he fondly cherished the recollection of <lb/>
<pb n="383" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0390"/>
the scenes of his home, when he and his brothers and <lb/>
sisters were assembled in the evening to read and <lb/>
draw under the direction of their father; and then, <lb/>
before breaking up for the night, there would be a <lb/>
compliance with the request for "one beautiful hymn <lb/>
from dear mamma." Could a child go forth into the <lb/>
world and forget such scenes and such teaching? <lb/>
No doubt there have been many instances where <lb/>
children have not become what was wished or <reg orig="antici-|pated">anticipated</reg>; <lb/>
but in the worst instances the prayers and <lb/>
the teaching and the example of a pious mother will <lb/>
have affected for good, and prevented much moral <lb/>
evil which otherwise would have been committed. <lb/>
Dr. Payson is not alone in his experience when he <lb/>
wrote to his father: "Is it not some satisfaction to <lb/>
reflect that to you and my mother I shall be indebted, <lb/>
under God, for everlasting felicity; and that if I am <lb/>
made the instrument of doing any good in the world, <lb/>
it will be owing to your prayers, precepts, and <lb/>
example." This is the experience of the poet <reg orig="Bloom-|field">Bloomfield</reg>, <lb/>
who was never heard to mention his mother <lb/>
without giving expression to his feelings of respect <lb/>
and affection which were her due; and Henry Kirke <lb/>
White, who certainly was a poet as the result of his <lb/>
mother's care and self-deprivation in order that <lb/>
Henry might obtain a liberal education, exhibited <lb/>
his gratitude in a letter to his mother in which this <lb/>
sentence occurred: "One of my first earthly wishes <lb/>
is to make you comfortable, and provide that rest <lb/>
<pb n="384" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0391"/>
and quiet for your mind which you so much need; <lb/>
and never fear but I shall have it in my power some <lb/>
time or other." Her life had been devoted to her <lb/>
son; but his fragile frame yielded to the strain of <lb/>
study, and in his twenty-first year he went "home."</p>
<p>William Allen, too, who was associated with <reg orig="Clark-|son">Clarkson</reg> <lb/>
and Wilberforce in obtaining the emancipation of <lb/>
the slave, would have devoted his talents and energies <lb/>
to chemistry, or some kindred science, had it not been <lb/>
for his mother, who, on discovering his natural <reg orig="abili-|ties">abilities</reg>, <lb/>
put from her the pride which would have been <lb/>
hers in learning that her son had attained distinction <lb/>
among scientific <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italic">savans</hi></foreign>. She had other hopes and <lb/>
prospects&mdash;a nobler end and aim for her son. "Thy <lb/>
talents," she wrote, "my beloved child, if rightly <lb/>
directed, would tend to spread heavenly knowledge, <lb/>
and to extend the government of the Prince of Peace." <lb/>
In complying with the wishes of his mother, science <lb/>
lost a son, but the slave gained a friend and the <lb/>
world a philanthropist. And the mother of the Rev. <lb/>
William Knibb, who was so eminent as an abolitionist <lb/>
and a missionary, felt the force of his mother's <reg orig="ex-|ample">example</reg> <lb/>
and words through life. When he was about <lb/>
to go to Jamaica to take the place of his brother, <lb/>
&lpar;who had died at his post,&rpar; he took farewell of his <lb/>
mother, and went forth into the street; but he was <lb/>
arrested by her voice, as she called to him from the <lb/>
window: "William, William! mind, William, I had <lb/>
rather hear that you had perished in the sea than <lb/>
<pb n="385" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0392"/>
that you had dishonoured the society you go to serve." <lb/>
Well might he say, as he did say: "I never forgot <lb/>
those words; they were written on my heart."</p>
<p>The Rev. Basil Woodd, also, in loving and <reg orig="affec-|tionate">affectionate</reg> <lb/>
words, bore testimony to the care and <reg orig="solici-|tude">solicitude</reg> <lb/>
exercised towards him by his mother. Writing <lb/>
to a friend, he said: "As a mother, I must repeat <lb/>
what you, my dear sir, have frequently said, that you <lb/>
never saw such an instance of maternal affection. <lb/>
This, indeed, is a subject on which I hope I shall <lb/>
never think without heartfelt gratitude to her, and <lb/>
to God, who so favoured me. The whole of her <lb/>
deportment was calculated to win my early attention <lb/>
to religion. I saw in her what it could do&mdash;how <lb/>
happy, how cheerful, how humble, how holy, how <lb/>
lovely in life and afterwards in death! how full of <lb/>
mercy and good fruits it could render the happy <lb/>
possessor!" And that example had its best effect in <lb/>
the subsequent life of Basil. John Sterling, in <reg orig="bear-|ing">bearing</reg> <lb/>
his testimony to the influence of his mother, said: <lb/>
"Dear mother, there is surely something uniting us <lb/>
that cannot perish. I seem so sure of a love which <lb/>
shall last and reunite us, that even the remembrance, <lb/>
painful as that is, of all my own follies and ill-<reg orig="tem-|pers">tempers</reg>, <lb/>
cannot shake this faith. When I think of you, <lb/>
and know how you feel towards me, and have felt for <lb/>
every moment of almost forty years, it would be too <lb/>
dark to believe that we shall never meet again. It <lb/>
was from you that I first learned to think, to feel, to <lb/>
<pb n="386" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0393"/>
imagine, to believe; and these powers, which cannot <lb/>
be extinguished, will one day enter anew into <reg orig="com-|munion">communion</reg> <lb/>
with you. I have bought it very dear, by the <lb/>
prospect of losing you in this world; but since you <lb/>
have been so ill, everything has seemed to me holier, <lb/>
loftier, and more lasting, more full of hope and final <lb/>
joy."</p>
<p>These instances, not less delightful than instructive, <lb/>
are only a few amongst many which might be cited <lb/>
of the power of a mother's loving influence in <reg orig="mould-|ing">moulding</reg> <lb/>
the character of her children. That influence was <lb/>
never exercised prayerfully and sincerely without <lb/>
good resulting. The day might be protracted and <lb/>
distant, the good seed might not appear until "after <lb/>
many days;" but ultimately it did appear, and will <lb/>
appear, if sown only in faith and with the sincerity <lb/>
or singleness of purpose which enters, controls, and <lb/>
subdues the most obdurate heart. This is indeed <lb/>
noble work for noble women, which will bear fruit <lb/>
throughout eternity.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> necessity of a wise education for women <lb/>
is seen in the fact that they have <reg orig="com-|mitted">committed</reg> <lb/>
to their care the training and <lb/>
education of children. The matrons of <lb/>
ancient Rome made it their glory to devote <reg orig="them-|selves">themselves</reg> <lb/>
to the study of economy and their children's <lb/>
education. "As soon as a son was born of a chaste <lb/>
parent," writes a Latin author, "he was not brought <lb/>
up in the cottage of some hireling nurse, but in the <lb/>
lap and in the bosom of his mother, whose principal <lb/>
merit it was to take care of the house, and to devote <lb/>
herself to the service of her children. Thus are we <lb/>
told, Cornelia, the mother of the Gracchi, thus Aurelia, <lb/>
of Julius C&aelig;sar, thus Attia, of Augustus, presided <lb/>
over the education of their children." In answer to <lb/>
the objection which is frequently made, that the <reg orig="diffi-|culties">difficulties</reg> <lb/>
connected with learning languages and abstruse <lb/>
subjects are foreign to the capacities and capabilities <lb/>
<pb n="388" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0395"/>
of the feminine mind, it may be replied in the <reg orig="lan-|guage">language</reg> <lb/>
of the same elegant author: "Let us accustom <lb/>
ourselves to that which we know is best. So that <lb/>
will become usual which was unusual, and that will <lb/>
become agreeable which was disagreeable, and that <lb/>
fashionable which appeared unfashionable." Proofs <lb/>
abound, both in ancient and in modern times, of the <lb/>
capability of females to acquire languages and to <lb/>
attain proficiency in philosophical pursuits. Socrates, <lb/>
who is boasted of as the wisest of mortals, was the <lb/>
pupil of a lady, who instructed him in "many elegant <lb/>
and profound subjects of learning." Athen&aelig;us says: <lb/>
"Aspasia, the learned lady, was the preceptress of <lb/>
Socrates in rhetoric." Plato, also, says that "Socrates <lb/>
learned politics of her."</p>
<p>Upon the subject of learning languages as an <reg orig="occu-|pation">occupation</reg> <lb/>
for females, Erasmus said: "A woman who is <lb/>
truly learned does not think that she is learned. On <lb/>
the contrary, one who, when she knows nothing, <lb/>
thinks that she knows everything, is doubly foolish. <lb/>
The common opinion is that the Latin language is ill <lb/>
suited to women, as not being likely to maintain their <lb/>
humility, since it is a rare and unusual thing for a <lb/>
woman to know Latin; but custom is a teacher of all <lb/>
bad things. It is honourable for a woman born in <lb/>
Germany to learn French, in order that she may <reg orig="con-|verse">converse</reg> <lb/>
with those that know French. Why, then, <lb/>
should it be thought indecorous to learn Latin, that <lb/>
she may daily converse with so many eloquent, <lb/>
<pb n="389" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0396"/>
learned, wise, and instructive authors? Certainly I <lb/>
would rather employ whatsoever has been given me <lb/>
of understanding in wholesome studies than in <lb/>
prayers repeated without being understood, in revels, <lb/>
and banquets." This extract from Erasmus, Lady <lb/>
Mary Wortley Montagu quoted in a letter to Bishop <lb/>
Burnet when she was only nineteen, accompanying a <lb/>
translation of the "Enchiridion" of Epictetus, which <lb/>
she had executed from the Latin. She was strongly in <lb/>
favour of females devoting a portion of each day to <lb/>
classical learning. It is a less expensive acquisition <lb/>
than any accomplishment. Two hours each day <lb/>
would suffice, and the value as a permanent resource <lb/>
would remain when that of more fashionable <reg orig="accom-|plishments">accomplishments</reg> <lb/>
had passed away. Lady Montagu, however, <lb/>
was not the only or the highest instance of female <lb/>
proficiency in learning. Madame Dacier in France, <lb/>
known to every student under the title of "Doctissima <lb/>
Daciera," was a most learned woman. Mrs. Carter in <lb/>
England was the translator of the works of Epictetus. <lb/>
This lady was a most proficient Greek scholar, and <lb/>
would with eminence have filled the chair as a <reg orig="pro-|fessor">professor</reg> <lb/>
in any of the universities. Dr. Johnson paid <lb/>
her a very high tribute when, speaking of some <reg orig="gen-|tleman's">gentleman's</reg> <lb/>
proficiency in learning, he said that he spoke <lb/>
Greek better than any person he had ever met with <lb/>
excepting Elizabeth Carter. Instead of her <reg orig="attain-|ments">attainments</reg> <lb/>
causing her to exhibit pride, all who knew her <lb/>
speak of her modesty and humility. True worth, <lb/>
<pb n="390" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0397"/>
indeed, is always humble, always modest. This was <lb/>
the character of Madame Dacier, a woman of profound <lb/>
learning. So far from being intoxicated with the <lb/>
applause bestowed upon her talents and <reg orig="acquire-|ments">acquirements</reg>, <lb/>
she exhibited remarkable reticence and <reg orig="retire-|ment">retirement</reg>. <lb/>
On one occasion, on being asked to write her <lb/>
name in a book devoted to the names of great <reg orig="per-|sons">persons</reg>, <lb/>
she steadily refused. At last, overcome by <reg orig="im-|portunity">importunity</reg>, <lb/>
she yielded to the request, but at the same <lb/>
time placed after her name a verse of Sophocles <lb/>
signifying that silence is suited to women. The <lb/>
same spirit of modesty induced her to decline the <lb/>
publication of her meditations on the Scriptures; <lb/>
which there can be no doubt would have been <reg orig="exceed-|ingly">exceedingly</reg> <lb/>
valuable. When she was only twenty-three, <lb/>
she published an edition of Callimachus with notes, <lb/>
and was afterwards employed by the Duke of <reg orig="Montau-|sier">Montausier</reg> <lb/>
in the Delphin editions. She then successively <lb/>
sent from the press an edition of Florus, Dicty's <lb/>
Cretensis, Sextus Aurelius, Anacreon and Sappho, <lb/>
Eutropius, translations of Plautus, translations of <lb/>
Aristophanes, translations of Terence, translations of <lb/>
two of Plutarch's "Lives," translation of the "Iliad," <lb/>
"Causes de la Corruption du Go&ucirc;t," "Hom&egrave;re <reg orig="De-|fendu">Defendu</reg>," <lb/>
translation of the "Odyssey." And yet this <lb/>
profoundly learned woman was thoroughly <reg orig="domesti-|cated">domesticated</reg>, <lb/>
and was careful in the performance of the <lb/>
ordinary affairs of life And why should this be <lb/>
otherwise? Correct and exact thought, the discipline <lb/>
<pb n="391" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0398"/>
which the acquirement of knowledge necessitates, will <lb/>
no doubt tend to order and regularity of life. Classical <lb/>
studies tend very powerfully to enlarge the mind, <lb/>
affording great variety for its exercise, and opening <lb/>
up large stores of information. This was specially <lb/>
seen to be the effect on Margaret Roper, the splendidly <lb/>
endowed and much-beloved daughter of Sir Thomas <lb/>
More, whose acquisitions were the praise of Erasmus; <lb/>
who wrote a letter to her, as a woman famous not <lb/>
only for virtue and piety, but for solid learning; and <lb/>
of whom Cardinal Pope was so delighted with the <lb/>
elegance of her Latin style that he would not believe <lb/>
it was the production of a woman. She wrote a <lb/>
reply to Quintilian, an oration in defence of the rich <lb/>
man whom he accuses of having poisoned, by <reg orig="venom-|ous">venomous</reg> <lb/>
flowers in his garden, the poor man's bees. This <lb/>
work is celebrated as a most eloquent production. <lb/>
She also wrote two declamations, and translated them <lb/>
into Latin. A treatise on the "Four Last Things," <lb/>
which she wrote, showed so much strong sense and <lb/>
judgment as obliged Sir Thomas to confess its <reg orig="supe-|riority">superiority</reg> <lb/>
to a discourse which he was himself composing <lb/>
on the same subject. She also successfully completed <lb/>
a translation of the "Ecclesiastical History" of <reg orig="Euse-|bius">Eusebius</reg> <lb/>
from the Greek to Latin. Her daughter Mary, <lb/>
imbibing the spirit of industry of her mother, became <lb/>
nearly as famous and as learned.</p>
<p>The infamous Henry VIII. had some good qualities; <lb/>
he was not altogether vile. He was among the first <lb/>
<pb n="392" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0399"/>
men in England to give his daughters a learned <lb/>
education, and thus cause a considerable revival of <lb/>
learning. It is said that during the period of the <lb/>
Reformation the study of Greek became more a <lb/>
fashionable accomplishment than a serious or <reg orig="labori-|ous">laborious</reg> <lb/>
study. A letter from the master of Eton, <lb/>
Nicholas Udal, in the time of Henry VIII., gives a <lb/>
most interesting account of the ladies of that period: <lb/>
"Now in this gracious and blissful time of <reg orig="know-|ledge">knowledge</reg>," <lb/>
said the learned master, "in which it hath <lb/>
pleased God Almighty to reveal and show abroad <lb/>
the light of his most holy gospel, what a number is <lb/>
there of noble women, especially here in this realm <lb/>
of England; yea, and how many in the years of <lb/>
tender virginity, not only as well seen, and as <lb/>
familiarly traded in the Latin and Greek tongues as <lb/>
in their own mother-language, but also in all kinds <lb/>
of literature and arts made exact, studied and <lb/>
exercised, and in the Holy Scripture and theology so <lb/>
ripe, that they are able aptly, wisely, and with much <lb/>
grace, either to indite or to translate into the vulgar <lb/>
tongue for the public instruction and edifying of the <lb/>
unlearned multitude. Neither is it now a strange <lb/>
thing to hear gentlewomen, instead of most vain <lb/>
communication about the moon shining in the water, <lb/>
to use grave and substantial talk in Latin and Greek <lb/>
with their husbands of godly matters. It is now no <lb/>
news in England for young damsels in noble houses, <lb/>
and in the courts of princes, instead of cards and <lb/>
<pb n="393" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0400"/>
other instruments of idle trifling, to have continually <lb/>
in their hands either psalms, homilies, and other <lb/>
devout meditations, or else Paul's epistles, or some <lb/>
book of Holy Scripture matters; and as familiarly to <lb/>
read or reason thereof in Greek, Latin, French, or <lb/>
Italian, as in English. It is now a common thing to <lb/>
see virgins so nursed and trained in the study of <lb/>
letters, that they willingly set all other vain pastimes <lb/>
at nought for learning's sake. It is now no news at <lb/>
all to see queens and ladies of most high state and <lb/>
progeny, instead of courtly dalliance, to embrace <lb/>
virtuous exercises of reading and writing, and with <lb/>
most earnest study, both early and late, to apply <lb/>
themselves to the acquiring of knowledge as well in <lb/>
all other liberal arts and disciplines, as also most <lb/>
especially of God and his most holy Word."</p>
<p>As an answer to the objection, which receives <lb/>
currency even at this day, that the intellect of woman <lb/>
is inferior to that of man, it may be useful and <lb/>
interesting to quote the letter attributed to Sappho: <lb/>
"They who say that beauty is the portion of <lb/>
woman, and that fine arts, good learning, and all the <lb/>
sublime and eminent sciences belong only to man, <lb/>
are as far from justice as from virtue. If it were so, <lb/>
all women would be born with beauty, and all men <lb/>
with a strong disposition to become learned; <reg orig="other-|wise">otherwise</reg>, <lb/>
Nature would be unjust in the disposition of <lb/>
her favours; nevertheless we see every day that <lb/>
ugliness is seen in our sex, and stupidity in the <lb/>
<pb n="394" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0401"/>
other. And if it were true that beauty is the only <lb/>
advantage which we receive from Heaven, all women <lb/>
would not only be fair, but I also believe that they <lb/>
would be so till death; that time would renew in <lb/>
them what it now destroys every moment; and that, <lb/>
being sent into the world only to let their beauty be <lb/>
seen, they would be fair as long as they should live <lb/>
in it. In short, it would be as strange a destiny to <lb/>
survive an age for one thing only that could make <lb/>
us commendable, as, out of many years to conduct us to <lb/>
the tomb, not to bloom above five or six. The <lb/>
things which Nature seems to have made for the <lb/>
ornament of the universe do rarely lose that beauty <lb/>
which she hath once given them. Gold, pearls, and <lb/>
jewels preserve their brightness as long as they have <lb/>
being; and the Ph&oelig;nix herself, as is said of her, dies <lb/>
with her beauty, that it may rise with her. Let us <lb/>
then infer, that because we see no roses or lilies in <lb/>
the fairest complexions which the rigour of some <lb/>
winters will not blast; because we see no eyes which, <lb/>
after they have been brighter than the sun, do not <lb/>
grow dim or glimmering, and which, after they have <lb/>
made a hundred conquests, find themselves in the <lb/>
condition of scarcely seeing the conquests of others; <lb/>
that since we see every instant of our life rob us, in <lb/>
spite of ourselves and in spite of our care, of the <lb/>
finest things that we have; and, in short, that this <lb/>
air of beauty is not strong enough to conquer disease, <lb/>
time, and old age,&mdash;let us infer, I say, that we must of <lb/>
<pb n="395" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0402"/>
necessity have other advantages than that. To look <lb/>
at it, then, with the eye of reason, beauty is in our <lb/>
sex what valour is in men; but as that quality <lb/>
does not hinder their love of the study of good <lb/>
learning, so this advantage does not hinder us from <lb/>
such study. But by an established custom among <lb/>
men, for fear of being excelled by us, study is as <lb/>
much forbidden us as war, and making of verses is <lb/>
as unbecoming as to give battle, if we will believe <lb/>
them. In short, we have nothing permitted us but <lb/>
what should rather be forbidden us. But, Erynna, <lb/>
we have a good fancy, a clear-sighted spirit, a <reg orig="for-|tunate">fortunate</reg> <lb/>
memory, a solid judgment; and must we <lb/>
employ all these in frizzling our hair, and seeking <lb/>
after ornaments which may add something to our <lb/>
beauty? No; that would be an unprofitable abuse <lb/>
of the favours which we receive from Heaven. I <lb/>
could, if I would, make appear, by a strong and <lb/>
puissant induction, that our sex can boast of being <lb/>
more richly furnished with spiritual treasures than <lb/>
the other sex; for consider, Erynna, that almost <lb/>
universal order which is to be seen among all animals <lb/>
that live in woods and caves: you see that they <lb/>
which are born with strength and courage are inferior <lb/>
in sagacity, while the weak have a stronger instinct, <lb/>
and come nearer to reason, than those to which <lb/>
nature has given other advantages. Judge you, <lb/>
then, according to this order: since nature has given <lb/>
more strength and more courage to men than to <lb/>
<pb n="396" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0403"/>
women, it should have also given more spirit and <lb/>
more judgment to us. I do not wish you such <lb/>
studies as make the complexion yellow, the eyes <lb/>
hollow, the countenance ghastly, the forehead <lb/>
wrinkled, and the humour melancholy. I would not <lb/>
have you shun society, but only to follow me to the <lb/>
borders of Parnassus: 'tis thither, Erynna, I would <lb/>
conduct you; 'tis there you shall surpass me as soon <lb/>
as you arrive; 'tis there you shall acquire beauty <lb/>
which neither time, seasons, old age, nor even death <lb/>
itself can rob you of; and in time, 'tis there you <lb/>
shall know perfectly that our sex is capable of <reg orig="every-|thing">everything</reg> <lb/>
it would undertake."</p>
<p>This letter of a heathen lady is true in modern <lb/>
times as much as it was true in the period when it <lb/>
was written. All that is needful for women, to make <lb/>
progress in intellectual culture, is to inspire them <lb/>
with the wish and furnish them with the means; <lb/>
and, in spite of the disadvantages under which they <lb/>
have so long laboured, instances are numerous in <lb/>
which females have either found or created the means <lb/>
of arriving at intellectual excellence and evincing a <lb/>
greatness of mind not surpassed by men.</p>

<p>A woman of eminent literary power, Frances <lb/>
Cobbe, in a "Social Science" paper, said, "The woman <lb/>
whose home was the happiest I ever saw, whose <lb/>
aged husband &lpar;as I have many times heard him&rpar; <lb/>
'rose up and called her blessed' above all, and <lb/>
whose children are among the most devoted, was the <lb/>
same woman who in her youth outstripped nearly <lb/>
all the men of her time in the paths of science, and <lb/>
who in her beloved and honoured age is still <reg orig="study-|ing">studying</reg> <lb/>
reverently the wonders of God's creation,&mdash;that <lb/>
woman is Mary Somerville." "And the woman whose <lb/>
philanthropy has been the most perfect, who has done <lb/>
more than any besides to save the criminal and <reg orig="va-|grant">vagrant</reg> <lb/>
children of our land, and whose whole time and <lb/>
heart are given to their instruction&mdash;that woman is <lb/>
the same who taught Homer and Virgil as assistant <lb/>
in her father's school at eighteen&mdash;that woman is <lb/>
Mary Carpenter."</p>
<p>It is singular that an impression should be too <lb/>
general that learning interferes with the domestic <lb/>
character of women; that learning makes them <reg orig="forget-|ful">forgetful</reg> <lb/>
of the duties of wife and mother; and give that <lb/>
time to Greek, Latin, or the sciences, which should be <lb/>
devoted to the comforts of home. The witty Sydney <lb/>
Smith once said: "A woman's love for her offspring <lb/>
hardly depends on her ignorance of Greek, nor need <lb/>
we apprehend that she will forsake an infant for a <lb/>
quadratic equation."</p>
<p>The most delightful instance, ancient or modern, <lb/>
<pb n="398" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0405"/>
of solid learning and eminent piety, is furnished in <lb/>
the life of Lady Jane Grey, who spoke and wrote, <lb/>
with the greatest facility and correctness, French, <lb/>
Italian, Latin, and Greek; she was versed also in <lb/>
Hebrew, Chaldee, and Arabic. She had a sedateness <lb/>
of temper, a quickness of apprehension, and a solidity <lb/>
of judgment, that enabled her not only to become <lb/>
the mistress of languages, but of sciences, so that she <lb/>
thought, spoke, and reasoned upon subjects of the <lb/>
greatest importance in a manner that surprised even <lb/>
those who from their own abilities were not inclined <lb/>
to esteem everything that the rest of the world <lb/>
thought very extraordinary. She was naturally <lb/>
fond of literature, and that fondness was much <lb/>
heightened as well by the severity of her parents in <lb/>
the feminine part of her education as by the <reg orig="gentle-|ness">gentleness</reg> <lb/>
of her tutor Aylmer in this;&mdash;when mortified <lb/>
and confounded by the unmerited chiding of the <lb/>
former, she returned with double pleasure to the <lb/>
lessons of the latter, and sought in Demosthenes and <lb/>
Plato, who were her favourite authors, that delight <lb/>
which was denied her in all the other scenes of life, <lb/>
in which she mingled but little, and seldom with <lb/>
any satisfaction. When, on one occasion, the famous <lb/>
Roger Ascham called on a visit to the family, all the <lb/>
rest of the ladies being out hunting in the park, he <lb/>
went to wait on Lady Jane in her apartment, and <lb/>
found her reading Plato's "Ph&aelig;do." Astonished at <lb/>
it, after the first compliments were passed he asked <lb/>
<pb n="399" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0406"/>
why she should lose such pastime as there needs <lb/>
must be in the park. At which she smilingly <lb/>
answered: "I wist all their sports in the park is but <lb/>
a shadow to that pleasure I find in Plato. Alas! <lb/>
good folk, they never knew what true pleasure <lb/>
meant." This naturally led him to inquire how a <lb/>
lady of her age&mdash;and she was then only fourteen&mdash; <lb/>
had attained to such a depth of pleasure both in <reg orig="Pla-|tonic">Platonic</reg> <lb/>
language and philosophy. She made a very <reg orig="re-|markable">remarkable</reg> <lb/>
reply: "I will tell you, and I will tell you <lb/>
a truth which perchance you will marvel at. One of <lb/>
the greatest benefits which ever God gave me is, <lb/>
that he sent me so very sharp parents and so gentle <lb/>
a schoolmaster. For whenever I am in presence of <lb/>
either my father or mother, whether I speak, keep <lb/>
silence, sit, stand, or go, eat, be merry or sad, be <reg orig="sew-|ing">sewing</reg>, <lb/>
playing, dancing, or doing anything else, I am <lb/>
so sharply taunted, so cruelly threatened, yea <reg orig="pres-|ently">presently</reg> <lb/>
sometimes with pinches, rips, and bobs, and other <lb/>
ways which I shall not name, for the honour I bear <lb/>
them, so without measure misordered, that I think <lb/>
myself in hell till the time come that I must go to <lb/>
Mr. Aylmer, who teacheth me so gently, so pleasantly, <lb/>
with such fair allurements to learning, that I think <lb/>
all the time nothing while I am with him; and when <lb/>
I am called from him I fall on weeping, because <lb/>
whatsoever I do beside learning is full of grief, <lb/>
trouble, fear, and wholly misliking unto me. And <lb/>
thus my book hath been so much my pleasure, and <lb/>
<pb n="400" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0407"/>
bringeth daily to me more pleasure and more, that <lb/>
in respect of it all other pleasures in very deed be but <lb/>
trifles and troubles unto me."</p>
<p>In her eighteenth year this lovely lady died upon <lb/>
the scaffold, a victim to the ambition of her parents, <lb/>
and to the malignant cruelty of a sovereign who <lb/>
possessed power only to misuse it. It is said that <lb/>
Judge Morgan, who passed sentence of death upon <lb/>
Lady Jane Grey, shortly after her execution became <lb/>
raving mad in consequence of his conviction of the <lb/>
injustice of her punishment. He died in that <reg orig="deplor-|able">deplorable</reg> <lb/>
condition, continually uttering piercing shrieks, <lb/>
and begging those around him to <hi rend="italic">take the Lady <lb/>
Jane away from him.</hi></p>
<p>Lady Jane is described by Dr. Fuller as possessing <lb/>
the united excellences of the various periods of life. <lb/>
She had the innocence of childhood, the beauty of <lb/>
youth, the solidity of middle life, and the wisdom of <lb/>
old age. Her birth was that of a princess; she had <lb/>
the learning of a divine and the life of a saint; and <lb/>
yet she suffered the death of a malefactor for the <lb/>
offences of her parents. Notwithstanding all her <lb/>
acquisitions, she was so humble and pious that <lb/>
everybody admired and loved her. She was neither <lb/>
exalted when she possessed the crown, nor greatly <lb/>
dejected when her palace became her prison, but <lb/>
maintained an equal temper of mind in those great <lb/>
inequalities of fortune. We may humbly believe <lb/>
that she is now shining resplendently in her heavenly <lb/>
<pb n="401" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0408"/>
Father's kingdom, since she had all the <reg orig="character-|istics">characteristics</reg> <lb/>
requisite for those who seek to inherit a glorious <lb/>
immortality. In proof how much she depended <lb/>
on God, and how little she was influenced by pride <lb/>
or vainglory, she wrote upon the walls of her prison <lb/>
the following touching and truthful lines:&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="stanza">
<l>"Think not, O mortal, vainly gay,</l>
<l rend="indent">That thou from human woes art free;</l>
<l>The bitter cup I drink to-day,</l>
<l rend="indent">To-morrow may be drunk by thee!</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>"Fruitless all malice if our God is nigh;</l>
<l>Useless all pains if he his help deny.</l>
<l>Patient I pass these gloomy hours away,</l>
<l>And wait the promise of eternal day."</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>The mainspring, the stimulus and excitement of <lb/>
Lady Jane Grey, was the fact of her spiritual <lb/>
relationship&mdash;that she was the child of her Creator, <lb/>
and that every action and thought was due to him; <lb/>
not more due than it is due from the reader whose <lb/>
eye glances at this page, but less reflected upon, <lb/>
less considered. The awful responsibility of living, <lb/>
of mere existence, is seldom duly weighed. Life is <lb/>
not an accident; the opportunities of life are not <lb/>
chances. There is a purpose in creation, not the <lb/>
least the culture and intellectual building up of the <lb/>
mind, which must live for ever&mdash;live co-eternally with <lb/>
its Author; and if it has been neglected, if <reg orig="oppor-|tunities">opportunities</reg> <lb/>
have passed unimproved, eternity will not be <lb/>
so fully enjoyed;&mdash;the consequence of a natural law. <lb/>
Culture is thus a duty; but it is more, it is a <reg orig="privi-|lege">privilege</reg>. <lb/>
<pb n="402" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0409"/>
Those who have only once entered with zest <lb/>
upon any intellectual pursuit know by experience real <lb/>
joy and happiness. Study, instead of being a <reg orig="weari-|ness">weariness</reg>, <lb/>
is a pleasure and recreation. Every step taken <lb/>
is but the prelude to another step. The end never <lb/>
comes. The more that is known, the more there is to <lb/>
be known. If Sir Isaac Newton could confess that, <lb/>
after all his great attainments, he had only <reg orig="ap-|proached">approached</reg> <lb/>
the vast unexplored sea of Knowledge, <lb/>
what must be the experience and confession of the <lb/>
generality of truth-seekers? The merest smattering <lb/>
and fringe of knowledge. And yet even that is a <lb/>
source of pleasure. It is not given to any one to <lb/>
know everything. But capability is given to every <lb/>
one to know something; and, with purpose and <lb/>
patience, to know something well.</p>
<p>God has so contrived and designed his creature <lb/>
man, that pure and unalloyed enjoyment is only <lb/>
found when he becomes a donor and giver of gifts. <lb/>
Many a tenderly cared-for young lady, who, in <reg orig="con-|sequence">consequence</reg> <lb/>
of wanting purpose and an object in life, <lb/>
becomes moody and misanthropic, existence a very <lb/>
weariness, and life itself a burden; is suddenly <lb/>
called to herself on finding employment that is <reg orig="con-|genial">congenial</reg> <lb/>
and useful. She has found that there are <lb/>
many ignorant and degraded beings in the world, <lb/>
who are ignorant because they have not had the <lb/>
opportunities of being taught, and she resolves to try <lb/>
to teach them; and in imparting her stores she finds <lb/>
<pb n="403" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0410"/>
the most unalloyed enjoyment in the completion of <lb/>
one object of her being. And then, too, she is <lb/>
allied in close bonds of friendship with some <reg orig="con-|genial">congenial</reg> <lb/>
spirit, with whom interchange of thought <lb/>
affords a delightful season of enjoyment. With <lb/>
knowledge, everything becomes pregnant with <reg orig="in-|terest">interest</reg>, <lb/>
is full of life&mdash;because it contains secrets <lb/>
which knowledge opens and reveals. There is surely <lb/>
a wise purpose in man's very restlessness; he is not <lb/>
content&mdash;cannot be content. He must inquire, learn, <lb/>
and know.</p>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"That man must daily wiser grow,</l>
<l>Whose search is bent himself to know;</l>
<l>Impartially he weighs his scope,</l>
<l>And on firm reason founds his hope.</l>
<l>He tries his strength before the race,</l>
<l>And never seeks his own disgrace!</l>
<l>He knows the compass, sail, and oar</l>
<l>Or never launches from the shore;</l>
<l>Before he builds, computes the cost,</l>
<l>And in no proud pursuit is lost.</l>
<l>He learns the bounds of human sense,</l>
<l>And safely walks within the fence.</l>
<l>Thus, conscious of his own defect,</l>
<l>Are pride and self-importance checked."</l>
</lg></q>
<p>Learning, then, is to be put to use; in no sense <lb/>
ought it to be a mere ornament, a decoration. No <lb/>
doubt many men are impelled to some special study <lb/>
by a taste or desire which seems to override every <lb/>
other consideration. And there is so much <reg orig="adap-|tation">adaptation</reg> <lb/>
in the human mind, that if a study be only <lb/>
proved useful, proved to be of any benefit to the <lb/>
student, the mind will apply its energies to master <lb/>
<pb n="404" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0411"/>
the desired subject. What to learn, and how to <lb/>
learn, are important considerations, which in the <lb/>
main must be influenced by the conditions of life <lb/>
and by the opportunities which life offers. In <reg orig="quot-|ing">quoting</reg> <lb/>
the instances of learned ladies who have attained <lb/>
to great acquirements in languages, it must not be <lb/>
assumed that the ladies of the present day should <lb/>
devote their energies to similar pursuits. Languages <lb/>
may be learned, and, in some circumstances, with <lb/>
great advantage and profit; but, as a rule, there <lb/>
are many more congenial and more profitable <reg orig="em-|ployments">employments</reg>. <lb/>
Knowledge of things, things seen and <lb/>
handled day by day, is knowledge which is repaid <lb/>
by solid satisfaction. The coal we burn, the gas we <lb/>
use, the food we consume; the manufacture of the <lb/>
garments we wear; the construction of our <reg orig="dwell-|ings">dwellings</reg>; <lb/>
the construction of our bodies, and a <reg orig="know-|ledge">knowledge</reg> <lb/>
of our mental capabilities; the thoughts which <lb/>
have passed through the minds of the greatest men <lb/>
and women who have lived upon the earth; the <lb/>
earth and water, the air and clouds, the sun, moon, <lb/>
and stars; the many millions of plants that grow <lb/>
upon the earth; the flies, worms, fishes, birds, and <lb/>
four-legged animals that live upon the earth,&mdash;are <lb/>
things which demand inquiry, to be ignorant of <lb/>
which is to be ignorant indeed. It is not less <reg orig="in-|teresting">interesting</reg> <lb/>
than profitable to know something of the <lb/>
people who have lived in old times and in other <lb/>
countries, and how they differed from the people <lb/>
<pb n="405" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0412"/>
living in modern times: for instance, the Egyptians, <lb/>
who built the great pyramids and the wonderful <lb/>
temples; the Babylonians, who had a city with huge <lb/>
walls, built of bricks, having writing that has <reg orig="re-|mained">remained</reg> <lb/>
a secret to the present time; the Jews, that <lb/>
ancient people, who were specially cared for by God; <lb/>
the Greeks, who were wise above all nations in <lb/>
thinking and speaking about men and their motives, <lb/>
and who had an extraordinary capability for carving <lb/>
statues, and erecting buildings, and writing wise and <lb/>
admirable books; the Romans, who were renowned <lb/>
throughout the world for war and skill in <reg orig="govern-|ment">government</reg>; <lb/>
and the inhabitants of the northern parts of <lb/>
Europe, who signalized their power by pulling down <lb/>
the Roman rule. And it is surely valuable <reg orig="know-|ledge">knowledge</reg>, <lb/>
to have an intimate acquaintance with the <lb/>
social, domestic, and political life and character of <lb/>
modern nations&mdash;the Italians, Germans, French, and <lb/>
English&mdash;and how they attained to their present <lb/>
position; and especially, to know something of the <lb/>
country in which we live, the laws and system of <lb/>
government; and beyond price, to know something <lb/>
of the noble men and women who have lived in the <lb/>
world, blessed the world, and left it better for having <lb/>
lived in it. Only let us be in earnest, let us desire to <lb/>
know, and this knowledge will become a daily <reg orig="pos-|session">possession</reg>; <lb/>
and when once the desire to learn has <lb/>
taken full possession of the mind, there are no heights <lb/>
to which man's capacity has gone to which the <lb/>
<pb n="406" entity="Johnson_NobleWomenOfOurTime_0413"/>
capacity of every human being so impelled may not <lb/>
attain.</p>
<q><lg type="group">
<l rend="indent">"Learning is good, but holiness is better;</l>
<l rend="indent">Learning with holiness combined&mdash;what then?</l>
<l rend="indent">Ay, that is best of all,&mdash;th' instructed mind,</l>
<l rend="indent">Which ignorance nor prejudice can fetter,</l>
<l rend="indent">That looks through nature with a searching ken</l>
<l rend="indent">And knows the history of human kind,</l>
<l rend="indent">And hath a store of treasures at command.</l>
<l rend="indent">If such can meekly bend, and humbly wait</l>
<l rend="indent">Beside the footstool of the Infinite,</l>
<l rend="indent">Eager to bask in beams of saving grace,</l>
<l rend="indent">Learning and goodness then go hand in hand,</l>
<l rend="indent">And happy is the people and the state</l>
<l rend="indent">That hath such learned men to shed the light</l>
<l>Of their example round their earthly resting-place."</l>
