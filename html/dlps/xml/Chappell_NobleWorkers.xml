<figure id="f2" rend="block" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0016"/>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">In</hi> the brief biographies contained in the following <lb/>
pages, we have endeavoured to set before our <lb/>
readers, as fully as the necessary limits of space <lb/>
would allow, noble and striking examples of the <lb/>
ministry of women.</p>
<p>The subjects of these memoirs are all women who <lb/>
have lived in our own day, and amid similar social <lb/>
environments to those which surround ourselves; <lb/>
not one of them was endowed with genius in the <lb/>
common acceptation of the term, neither poetry, art, <lb/>
literature, nor the drama having bestowed its coveted <lb/>
laurels upon any of them; and yet the names of <lb/>
such as Frances Willard, Lady Henry Somerset, <lb/>
Agnes Weston, Sarah Robinson, Sister Dora and <lb/>
Catherine Booth will live embalmed in thousands of <lb/>
grateful memories and hearts, when others, famous <lb/>
for more brilliant talent, may haply be forgotten.</p>
<p>But if our heroines, as they may be called, using <lb/>
the word in its truest sense, were not all distinguished <lb/>
by dazzling intellectual attainments, they surely <lb/>
belong to that great, Divinely-endowed band of <lb/>
whom St. Paul writes in I Corinthians xii. 4&ndash;10:&mdash; <lb/>
"To one is given, by the Spirit, the word of wisdom; <lb/>
to another, the word of knowledge, by the same <lb/>
Spirit; to another, faith, by the same Spirit; to <lb/>
<pb n="vi" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0017"/>
another, the gifts of healing." Each cultivated, for <lb/>
the glory of God and the good of her fellow-creatures, <lb/>
the best powers she possessed, and there are none, <lb/>
however humble, who may not do the same.</p>
<p>As for the brevity of our sketches, where so much <lb/>
more might have been recorded, we can only say <lb/>
that it was intentional, because in this busy age <lb/>
people more easily find time to read a short <reg orig="bi-|ography">biography</reg> <lb/>
than a long one, and it has rendered possible <lb/>
that striking juxtaposition of varying types of noble <lb/>
women, whose diversity of character and similarity <lb/>
of usefulness it has been one of the chief objects of <lb/>
our work to set forth.</p>
<p>If we succeed in inspiring any young reader with <lb/>
a higher sense of the glorious possibilities of a <lb/>
woman's ministry, our pleasant task will not have <lb/>
been in vain.</p>

A SUNNY CHILDHOOD.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Some</hi> children bring sunshine with them when <lb/>
they come into the world, others find it waiting <lb/>
for them; Frances Willard seems to have been <lb/>
one of those few favoured mortals to whose share <lb/>
falls the double portion of brightness&mdash;sunshine <reg orig="with-|in">within</reg> <lb/>
and without.</p>
<p>She was born&mdash;a longed-for and prayed-for little <lb/>
daughter, to fill the aching void left by the early death <lb/>
of a baby sister&mdash;on the 28th of September, 1839, at <lb/>
Churchville, Monroe County, N.Y.</p>
<p>Her father was the son of Elijah Willard, a good <lb/>
New England Puritan pastor, and descended from <lb/>
the Willards who had lived at Horsmonden, in Kent, <lb/>
for nearly six hundred years. He was a man of <lb/>
somewhat severe mould, high-principled, cultured, <lb/>
<pb n="14" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0025"/>
and intellectual, but suffering the life-long <reg orig="disadvan-|tage">disadvantage</reg> <lb/>
of weak physical health.</p>
<p>Mrs. Willard, on the other hand, was blessed with <lb/>
abounding health and spirits, and a rarely lovely <lb/>
disposition. Gifted in many ways beyond the <reg orig="aver-|age">average</reg>, <lb/>
she was yet able to be cheery and contented in <lb/>
circumstances that must often have been sorely <lb/>
uncongenial to her. A poet at heart, her mind was <lb/>
stored with gems from Cowper, Coleridge, Thomson, <lb/>
and others of the same type. Her daughter has <lb/>
recorded that her exquisitely expressive rendering of <lb/>
Wordsworth's "Intimations of Immortality," even at <lb/>
the advanced age of eighty-six, was beyond anything <lb/>
she had elsewhere heard.</p>
<p>The tenderness and spirituality of Mrs. Willard's <lb/>
character equalled its poetry, and although she did <lb/>
not "talk religion" to her children, she taught them <lb/>
of God's great goodness and beauty in all His works, <lb/>
finding Him in every cloud, and flower, and chirping <lb/>
bird; she made them "love the Heart that is at <lb/>
Nature's heart," and when she prayed, she uttered <lb/>
fewer petitions than thanksgivings. "Thou hast <lb/>
done us only good," she would say. "Thou dost <lb/>
brood over us as a mother-bird broods over her <reg orig="help-|less">helpless</reg> <lb/>
little ones." She taught her children gentle <lb/>
manners, but she never restrained their healthy <reg orig="free-|dom">freedom</reg>; <lb/>
she put everything in their way that was good, <lb/>
best of all, a good example, but she never forced or <lb/>
fretted them into following it.</p>
<p>Frances had a brother, Oliver, five years older than <lb/>
herself, and a sister, Mary, who was three years <lb/>
younger. Our heroine was a small and delicate child, <lb/>
bright, clever, and affectionate, as one can easily <lb/>

believe, but physically somewhat slow of <reg orig="develop-|ment">development</reg>; <lb/>
at fifteen she looked more like a girl of <lb/>
twelve.</p>
<p>When she was two years old, the family removed <lb/>
from Churchville to Oberlin, and again, when she was <lb/>
seven, to "Forest Home," an isolated farmstead in <lb/>
Wisconsin.</p>
<p>Here, for twelve happy years, the three young folks <lb/>
lived with Nature. Their father was as passionate a <lb/>
lover of trees and birds and flowers for their own <lb/>
sakes as his wife was for the preciousness of their <lb/>
revelation. He took his children about with him, <lb/>
delighting to teach and interest them in all he <lb/>
knew and cared for himself. Although a scholar and <lb/>
a man of books, Mr. Willard was of so practical a <lb/>
mind, that under his cultivation "Forest Home" <lb/>
became in the course of years the prize farm of the <lb/>
county. Here were sown in Frances' mind the seeds <lb/>
of those temperance principles which were in later <lb/>
years to influence the nation and the world; for no <lb/>
alcoholic beverage of any sort did Mr. Willard allow <lb/>
in his home, or to his field labourers, though a <lb/>
pleasant "harvest drink," compounded of water, <lb/>
molasses and ginger, was supplied to the latter in <lb/>
abundance.</p>
<p>The three children were almost continually out of <lb/>
doors; the girls as far as possible following and <reg orig="imi-|tating">imitating</reg> <lb/>
their big brother in all that he did. They spun <lb/>
tops, they played marbles, they walked on stilts, they <lb/>
climbed trees, they harnessed the horses and milked <lb/>
the cows. They were not, however, allowed to ride. <lb/>
But so great a deprivation did Frances&mdash;or "Frank" <lb/>
to use her home name&mdash;feel this restriction to be, that <lb/>
<pb n="18" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0029"/>
she did not rest satisfied until she had trained a young <lb/>
heifer to wear a saddle and carry a rider!</p>
<p>It is enough to send town children into fits of <lb/>
hopeless longing to read of the lovely times these <lb/>
youngsters had, of the picnics in the woods, whither <lb/>
a toothsome lunch was carried by the goat which <lb/>
Mary possessed as an off-set to Frank's trained cow; <lb/>
of their archery competitions; of the two oaks by the <lb/>
homestead gate, in the branches of which each girl <lb/>
had a snug seat fitted up, a sort of aerial "den" sacred <lb/>
to herself, of the games in the big play-house that <lb/>
was built for them when the barn was being put up, <lb/>
of the make-believe fights with "Injuns," and the <lb/>
doings of "The Rustic Club."</p>
<p>These healthful recreations were not only tolerated <lb/>
but actually helped forward by their wise and <reg orig="sym-|pathetic">sympathetic</reg> <lb/>
mother, who allowed each child to develop <lb/>
according to his or her natural bent; while Mary <lb/>
loved housewifely occupations, Frances took more <lb/>
kindly to hammer and nails.</p>
<p>The Willards' nearest visiting neighbours lived <lb/>
about a mile away; these were Mr. and Mrs. Hodge, <lb/>
and their three boys. Mr. Hodge was a Yale College <lb/>
graduate, and had been Latin tutor at Oberlin <lb/>
College, and his wife, a gifted and cultured woman, <lb/>
was Mrs. Willard's greatest friend. But as there were <lb/>
no little girls of suitable age at the Hodges' home, <lb/>
Frank and Mary Willard seem to have had their <lb/>
games chiefly with themselves and their brother.</p>
<p>For indoor amusements they wrote diaries, "edited" <lb/>
papers, drew, painted, and modelled in clay. The <lb/>
laws enacted for the "city" which they planned <lb/>
round and about "Forest Home," and the rules of "The <lb/>
<pb n="19" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0030"/>
Artists" and "The Rustic Club," which they also <lb/>
inaugurated, show a remarkable gift for organising on <lb/>
the part of these bright young people. The city, we <lb/>
may remark &lpar;"Fort City" was its name&rpar; was to have <lb/>
no drinking-saloons, no billiard halls, and of course <lb/>
would require no jail. But whether it ever reached <lb/>
a further stage of development than the laying out of <lb/>
"Broadway" in front of the farmstead gate, by means <lb/>
of digging out with a fire-shovel and paving with <lb/>
bricks and pebbles, and the election of the city <lb/>
officials, history does not relate.</p>
<p>There was something of Puritanical strictness in the <lb/>
way the Sabbath was kept at "Forest Home"; yet such <lb/>
were the simple and natural conditions of life there, <lb/>
that even this does not seem to have pressed hardly <lb/>
upon the children. No work was to be done, of even <lb/>
the most trivial nature, on that day, no books read <lb/>
except such as were of a decidedly religious character, <lb/>
and no calls made or received. This latter precaution <lb/>
seems to have been somewhat unnecessary, for, as <lb/>
Frances says, "there was nobody to come but the <lb/>
birds, and nowhere to go except to the fields and <lb/>
pastures." For the rest, the girls went to church in <lb/>
the town of Janesville every Sunday morning, with <lb/>
their elders by turns, either Mr. Willard, Mrs. Willard, <lb/>
or Oliver always staying at home to mind house and <lb/>
cook the delicious Sunday dinner, which, religious <lb/>
rules notwithstanding, was an institution at "Forest <lb/>
Home."</p>
<p>Later in the day, Mr. Willard thought it no wrong <lb/>
to take his little girls for a pleasant stroll in the <lb/>
pasture, or by the broad, tree-shaded river. Frances, <lb/>
as fond of her jack-knife as any boy, was, however, on <lb/>
<pb n="20" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0031"/>
these occasions allowed to "whittle" only, the <reg orig="fashion-|ing">fashioning</reg> <lb/>
of whistles, or any other of the objects she was so <lb/>
skilful at carving, being for the day prohibited.</p>
<p>On the Sabbath evenings, attendance at Divine <lb/>
worship a second time being precluded by the <reg orig="dis-|tance&mdash;about">distance&mdash;about</reg> <lb/>
four miles&mdash;of this prairie farm from <lb/>
the church, the parents and children would gather <lb/>
together to sing simple old-fashioned hymns from the <lb/>
Methodist hymn-book. Needless to say, Bible-reading <lb/>
and prayers were part of the daily life of the family, <lb/>
but the children were not by any means pushed, much <lb/>
less goaded, into the paths of righteousness; Mrs. <lb/>
Willard believed firmly in prayer, example, and <lb/>
natural development. It was her oft-expressed <reg orig="con-|viction">conviction</reg> <lb/>
that every one receives "according to their <lb/>
faith."</p>
<p>The heroine of our sketch was not a pattern of early <lb/>
piety according to conventional ideas. From her <lb/>
infantile days it was instinctive in her, when told <lb/>
anything about God or revelation, to ask "How do <lb/>
you know?" She strongly objected to be talked to <lb/>
on the subject of religion, and was too shy to allow <lb/>
anyone, except perhaps her dearly-loved sister, Mary, <lb/>
to guess when she was even deeply moved. Yet faith <lb/>
and love were surely growing, though hidden, in her <lb/>
childish heart, for years afterwards she remembered <lb/>
stretching out her hand towards the blue sky as she <lb/>
lay on the grass by the river-bank, and saying to her <lb/>
sister, "See there! could you resist a hand that so <lb/>
much wanted to clasp your own? Of course you <lb/>
couldn't and God cannot, either. I believe that <lb/>
though I do not see, He reaches down to me."</p>
<p>The love between Frances and Mary, as well as <lb/>
<pb n="21" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0032"/>
between the girls and their kind, good-natured big <lb/>
brother, Oliver, was very great. Frances was ardent <lb/>
and affectionate, Mary, gentle and sweet. Mary's <lb/>
conscience was exceedingly tender, at one time almost <lb/>
morbidly so, but Frank's more vigorous mind helped <lb/>
to balance that of the younger girl. Mutually they <lb/>
agreed to the lovely custom of asking each other's <lb/>
forgiveness, just before going to sleep at night, for <lb/>
anything during the day which had been not quite <lb/>
sisterly and kind, and thanking one another for all <lb/>
that had been good. "I ask your forgiveness and <lb/>
thank you," was the abbreviated formula, to which the <lb/>
answer was, "I freely forgive you, and welcome." <lb/>
This habit was kept up until, after "nineteen beautiful <lb/>
years," came the final "good-night" of sweet Mary's <lb/>
life on earth, and her sister "asked her forgiveness <lb/>
and thanked her" for the last time.</p>
<p>Studying from books formed but a small item in <lb/>
the lives of these "prairie flowers" until Frances was <lb/>
twelve years old. Frances actually could not write <lb/>
her name until she was nine; a little desultory <reg orig="learn-|ing">learning</reg> <lb/>
of lessons and practising of pot-hooks and hangers <lb/>
on winter evenings under their mother's supervision <lb/>
being all the schooling to which they were subjected. <lb/>
But at length, much to their delight, it was arranged <lb/>
that an accomplished young lady, a Miss Burdick, <lb/>
daughter of Colonel Burdick who had recently come <lb/>
to reside in the neighbourhood, should teach them <lb/>
daily in their own home, with the two daughters of <lb/>
another neighbour for companions.</p>
<p>The girls rushed to the joys of study with the <lb/>
keenest zest&mdash;their brother had already, for two winters <lb/>
been attending an academy in Janesville&mdash;and in one <lb/>
<pb n="22" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0033"/>
year, we are assured, learned as much as "little ones <lb/>
are tormented into, now, during seven"! The diaries <lb/>
which they both kept, and Frances' early poems, are <lb/>
sufficient proof that this assertion is not an <reg orig="exagger-|ated">exaggerated</reg> <lb/>
one.</p>
<p>Miss Burdick, though only eighteen years old, was a <lb/>
goddess in the eyes of these little rustic maidens; <lb/>
she taught them singing, drawing, and botany, as well <lb/>
as more prosaic accomplishments; she was not a <lb/>
teacher only, but a dearly-loved companion and <lb/>
friend, and to her Frances confided some of her own <lb/>
longings and aspirations. For by this time the girl's <lb/>
future work was already foreshadowing itself in her <lb/>
yearning, unsuggested by anyone, to write for the <lb/>
press, and even "to speak in public, if she dared." <lb/>
Strange to say, a prophetic instinct, even at thirteen <lb/>
years old, was whispering to Frances Willard that <lb/>
something quite out of the common lot awaited her, <lb/>
and she was wont to tell Miss Burdick that she knew <lb/>
she was "born to a fate." This was no mere youthful <lb/>
bumptiousness, but, we believe, as solemn a calling <lb/>
from Heaven as that of Samuel of old; and in the same <lb/>
spirit of obedience as his, the child lying on the prairie <lb/>
grass would lift her hands towards the sky and say <lb/>
in her inmost heart, "What is it&mdash;what is it that I am <lb/>
to be, O God?"</p>
<p>After two years of "play-school" with Miss Burdick, <lb/>
Mr. Willard and his friend, Mr. Inman, the father of <lb/>
the girls' fellow-scholars, succeeded in getting a small <lb/>
district school-house built about a mile from "Forest <lb/>
Home," and here, according to American custom, were <lb/>
soon assembled most of the young folks of the <lb/>
neighbourhood, boys and girls, gentle and simple, <lb/>
<pb n="23" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0034"/>
under one roof, to benefit by the instructions of Mr. <lb/>
Hodge, now "Professor," who had accepted the post <lb/>
of teacher, and as a graduate of Yale College was well <lb/>
equipped for his task.</p>
<p>This gentleman, who was an Englishman by birth, <lb/>
and rejoiced in the patriotic Christian name of <hi rend="italic">Nelson <lb/>
Wellington</hi>, seems to have been an excellent tutor, <lb/>
but he was replaced after four months by his wife's <lb/>
sister, Mrs. Hovey, whose brightness, geniality, and <lb/>
aptitude to teach "made school just like a play-day" <lb/>
to her fortunate pupils.</p>
<p>But we must linger no longer over Frances Willard's <lb/>
childish days. The last teacher she and her sister <lb/>
had at "Forest Home" was their mother's accomplished <lb/>
sister Sarah, who came on a visit to the prairie farm <lb/>
when Frances was in her early teens; and after her <lb/>
departure, the girls, whose appetites for learning had <lb/>
been keenly whetted, gave their father little peace <lb/>
until he consented to let them go to college.</p>

<div2 type="chapter" n="II" id="d16">
<head><hi rend="bold">CHAPTER II. <lb/>
"WHERE THE BROOK AND RIVER MEET."</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">In</hi> the spring of 1857, Frances, having been by this <lb/>
time unwillingly introduced to hairpins, and <lb/>
inducted into a "hateful new gown" with a long <lb/>
skirt, that precluded all future possibilities of <reg orig="fence-|jumping">fence-jumping</reg> <lb/>
and tree-climbing, went with her sister to <lb/>
Milwaukee Female College, where their Aunt Sarah, <lb/>
mentioned above, was one of the leading teachers.</p>
<p>Ere this, however, our heroine had gained her <lb/>
<pb n="24" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0035"/>
earliest public distinction as winner of the first prize&mdash; <lb/>
a silver medal and a "lovely cup"&mdash;offered by the <lb/>
Illinois Agricultural Society for the best essay on <lb/>
"The Embellishment of a Country Home," for <lb/>
which she had taken her own beautiful home as a <lb/>
model.</p>
<p>She was a restless, adventurous spirit, and much as <lb/>
she loved her kindred with the whole strength of an <lb/>
intensely affectionate nature, the girl longed for a <lb/>
wider horizon and fuller scope for her powers.</p>
<p>Mrs. Willard had said&mdash;and the words are worth <lb/>
writing in letters of gold:&mdash;"To be busy doing <reg orig="some-|thing">something</reg> <lb/>
that is worthy to be done is the happiest thing <lb/>
in all this world for girl or boy, for old or young." So <lb/>
to content her daughter's active mind, opportunities <lb/>
for an advanced course of study were provided, and <lb/>
for a time proved all-sufficient.</p>
<p>The remarkable freedom and independence of <lb/>
Frances' nature was demonstrated when, on her <lb/>
eighteenth birthday&mdash;her "coming of age" according <lb/>
to the American standard&mdash;she being at home for the <lb/>
vacation after her first college term, she coolly <reg orig="com-|menced">commenced</reg> <lb/>
reading "Ivanhoe" before her father's face.</p>
<p>He was at first inclined to be indignant, novels of <lb/>
every description being contraband in "Forest Home"; <lb/>
but when his daughter gravely and respectfully <lb/>
asserted her newly attained right to do what seemed <lb/>
good in her own eyes, he laughed, and contested the <lb/>
point no more.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1858, Frances and Mary <reg orig="com-|menced">commenced</reg> <lb/>
study at the North-Western Female College, <lb/>
Evanston, near Chicago, the best educational <reg orig="estab-|lishment">establishment</reg> <lb/>
for women at that time known.</p>
<pb n="25" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0036"/>
<p>While here, the elder girl was a cause of some <lb/>
anxiety to Professor Jones, the President of the <lb/>
College, who was an earnest Christian, by her <reg orig="appar-|ently">apparently</reg> <lb/>
pronounced sceptical tendencies. Revival <lb/>
meetings took place during her first College term, but <lb/>
after once being over-persuaded by this well-meaning <lb/>
gentleman to go with others "to the altar"&mdash;which <lb/>
we take to be something analogous to the "penitent <lb/>
form" of Salvation Army fame&mdash;the girl's natural <lb/>
honesty asserted itself so far as to prompt her to write <lb/>
the Professor a letter, begging to be excused from <lb/>
taking part in any more of such demonstrations until <lb/>
inwardly conscious of a change of heart.</p>
<p>In this letter she wrote: "If there is a God, a <lb/>
heaven, a hell, a devil, then I am undone. I have <lb/>
been taught to think that all these exist, yet from <lb/>
childhood I have doubted."</p>
<p>Nevertheless, at the same period, the same girl <lb/>
penned these words in her diary:&mdash;"I think God <lb/>
most that He has made us so that we may make <lb/>
ourselves great, wise, and good, that we may change <lb/>
ourselves in mind from helpless babes to strong, <lb/>
steadfast characters."</p>
<p>No wonder that Professor Jones concluded presently <lb/>
that her "scepticism was of a mild form. Most of all, <lb/>
she doubted all her doubts."</p>
<p>"What a queer girl Frank Willard is!" said one of <lb/>
her companions to him. "She won't confess that she <lb/>
knows or believes anything. She says she doesn't <lb/>
know whether there is a God, and the doesn't know <lb/>
whether the Bible is true; she is trying to find <lb/>
out."</p>
<p>"Don't be distressed, Mattie," the wise man replied <lb/>
<pb n="26" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0037"/>
"If she will only keep on trying to find out, she will <lb/>
find out. All her friends have to do is to pray that <lb/>
she may persevere."</p>
<p>It was while pursuing her ordinary course of study <lb/>
that light came, and Wayland's "Moral Science," <lb/>
which she was reading in preparation for an <reg orig="examina-|tion">examination</reg>, <lb/>
was, under God, the means of Frances Willard's <lb/>
conversion. On a blank half-page of that volume, <lb/>
her good friend, Professor Jones, was one day <reg orig="over-|joyed">overjoyed</reg> <lb/>
to find this memorandum written by her to <lb/>
meet his eye:&mdash;"When I began this study I could <lb/>
not say whether there was a God or no&mdash;and if <lb/>
there was, whether He cared for me or not. Now, <lb/>
thanks to President Wayland and my faithful <lb/>
instructors, I can say from my heart I believe that <lb/>
there is a God, and that He is my Father."</p>
<p>Shortly after, the brave and earnest-hearted girl <lb/>
voluntarily made her public confession of faith&mdash;not <lb/>
under the excitement and pressure of a revival <lb/>
meeting, but on one quiet Sunday evening, when, <lb/>
the pastor having at the close of an ordinary service <lb/>
asked any who wished to unite with the church on <lb/>
probation to meet him at the altar, she alone of the <lb/>
whole congregation responded.</p>
<p>This was the beginning of a steady Christian life, <lb/>
which deepened, brightened, and unfolded year by year.</p>
<p>As a school-girl, Frances was popular both on <lb/>
account of her intellectual gifts and her buoyant <lb/>
spirits. A companion of these college <reg orig="days&mdash;after-|wards">days&mdash;afterwards</reg> <lb/>
a dearly-loved sister-in-law&mdash;says: "It was <lb/>
but a few weeks till she was editor of the College <lb/>
paper, and leader of all the intellectual forces among <lb/>
the students. &hellip; She was an inventor of sport, and <lb/>
<pb n="27" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0038"/>
her ingenuity devised many an amusement which <lb/>
was not all amusement, but which involved <reg orig="consider-|able">considerable</reg> <lb/>
exercise of wit and intelligence&mdash;and our beloved <lb/>
Professor soon found that he could always rely upon <lb/>
her influence in the school to counteract the tendency <lb/>
to silly escapades and moonlight walks with the <lb/>
University boys. &hellip; If one of those school-mates <lb/>
had been called upon to sum up in a sentence a <lb/>
rough estimate of her friend, she would probably at <lb/>
this period have given as her opinion, 'She's the <lb/>
leader of all sport among the girls, and doesn't care a <lb/>
snap for the boys.'"</p>
<p>Early in the autumn of 1858 the Willard family <lb/>
let their beloved "Forest Home," and removed to <lb/>
Evanston, Mrs. Willard, from certain revelations made <lb/>
by Frances as to the temptations of college life, <reg orig="fear-|ing">fearing</reg> <lb/>
to let her daughters be so far from their parents' <lb/>
oversight and care.</p>
<p>The last year at school was one of great strain for <lb/>
the ardent young student, and she twice broke down <lb/>
in health before graduation&mdash;the goal of her ambitions <lb/>
&mdash;was triumphantly reached. This, however, was <lb/>
attained in the summer of 1859, and passionately as <lb/>
she loved learning, and affectionately as she regarded <lb/>
both teachers and class-mates, such was Frances' <lb/>
natural repugnance to rule and restraint, that she said <lb/>
farewell to college life with joy.</p>
<p>The diary of Frances Willard's first year out of <lb/>
school is full of such noble aspirations and desires as <lb/>
we should expect to be the flower-buds of the life <lb/>
that followed. Particularly did she yearn to become <lb/>
more loving and gentle, and to be of use of comfort <lb/>
in the world.</p>
<pb n="28" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0039"/>
<p>"Ask the mighty, infinite Helper," she exhorts <lb/>
herself in a written soliloquy, "to model you by His <lb/>
plans, <hi rend="italic">let them be what they will,</hi> so that every year <lb/>
you may grow 'calmer and calmer,' richer in love and <lb/>
peacefulness, and forgetting the poor dreams of less <lb/>
thoughtful years, have this, and this only, for your <lb/>
ambition: to be gentle, kindly, and forgiving, full of <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">charity</hi> which suffereth long, and patience which is <lb/>
pleasing in the sight of God and man."</p>
<p>And again:&mdash;"I have resolved that neither public <lb/>
opinion, nor narrow-minded pride, nor any other <lb/>
creature, shall prevent me from showing, whenever <lb/>
I can, kindness as delicate and respect as genuine as <lb/>
I know how, to those whom the community, as a rule, <lb/>
treats slightingly or with positive neglect. If I do <lb/>
this, I shall be of value to the world, whether the <lb/>
world knows it or not. I shall, I think, bring some <lb/>
happiness into troubled and wounded hearts, and, oh, <lb/>
will it not be sweet to remember in the hour when <lb/>
I shall most need comfort, the hour in which I am to <lb/>
die!"</p>
<p>But the young eaglet could not be quiet for long in <lb/>
the home nest. Frances' inborn love of freedom and <lb/>
variety, not by any means to be confused with <lb/>
changeableness or fickleness, prompted her once more <lb/>
to crave to be on the wing. Anticipating opposition <lb/>
from her father, who was well able to support her in <lb/>
comfort, and did not consider that women ought to <lb/>
want to earn money, she did the deed on her own <lb/>
responsibility, and confessed afterwards. She accepted <lb/>
the post of teacher at a small school-house on the <lb/>
borders of the prairie, some ten miles from home.</p>
<p>Here, at the village of Harlem, she tried her <lb/>
<pb n="29" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0040"/>
'prentice hand on some very rough material, and first <lb/>
learned what home-sickness meant. Still a child in <lb/>
heart and nature, she pathetically confided to her <lb/>
diary her earnest resolutions "not to cry" over her <lb/>
difficulties, but to remember her age. But she seems <lb/>
all the while to be conscious of weakness or <reg orig="undevelop-|ment">undevelopment</reg> <lb/>
of character, which she heroically set herself to <lb/>
remedy.</p>
<p>"I am twenty years old," she writes, "and I have <lb/>
neither dignity nor womanliness. &hellip; I am neither <lb/>
self-reliant nor self-contained. &hellip; I have never been <lb/>
out in the world, have had no care or trouble, no grief <lb/>
worth mentioning, no 'lovyer,' as my brother says, <lb/>
nor any love affair to sober me. &hellip; I see clearly <lb/>
that I shall never be the grown-up person that I ought <lb/>
to be until I have borne sorrows and had cares."</p>
<p>Poor little girl! A greater sorrow than she ever <lb/>
dreamed possible was slowly but surely creeping <lb/>
towards her along the sunny path of the future.</p>
<p>After a few months' experience at Harlem, <reg orig="fol-|lowed">followed</reg> <lb/>
by a holiday at home, Frances went as assistant <lb/>
teacher to an academy at the town of Kankakee, <lb/>
about sixty miles from Chicago, but owing to the <lb/>
urgent wishes of her parents, remained there only one <lb/>
term.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1861 she taught Harlem school <lb/>
again for a few weeks, and in the following year, <lb/>
living at home, she was employed at the public <lb/>
school of Evanston. It was about this period that <lb/>
Miss Willard was secretly engaged for some months <lb/>
to a young divinity student named Fowler. Years <lb/>
later, she expressed a wish that this little romance <lb/>
might be made known after her death, as she "believed <lb/>
<pb n="30" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0041"/>
it might contribute to a better understanding between <lb/>
good men and women."</p>
<p>This engagement was entered into "on the <reg orig="sup-|position">supposition</reg> <lb/>
that an intellectual comradeship was sure to <lb/>
deepen into unity of heart." But the young couple <lb/>
discovered in time that they were really too much <lb/>
alike for mutual happiness, both displaying marked <lb/>
strength of character and natural powers of <reg orig="leader-|ship">leadership</reg>. <lb/>
In consequence, this love affair, the only <lb/>
episode of its kind, we believe, which occurred in the <lb/>
life of the charming woman of whom Mr. Stead has <lb/>
said that "women loved and men adored her" came <lb/>
to an untimely end, and Frances Willard's spirit <lb/>
remained free to the last of her days.</p>
<p>In June, 1862, came the first great sorrow of our <lb/>
heroine's life.</p>
<p>We have not had space in this brief memoir to <lb/>
accord more than a passing mention to that lovely <lb/>
young sister whose brief biography Miss Willard <lb/>
herself has so touchingly told in "Nineteen Beautiful <lb/>
Years." But the record of an almost cloudless <reg orig="child-|hood">childhood</reg> <lb/>
and girlhood closes with those three <reg orig="heart-break-|ing">heart-breaking</reg> <lb/>
words in Frances' diary, "<hi rend="italic">Mary is dead</hi>," and the <lb/>
sun never shone for her with undimmed radiance <lb/>
again.</p>

MISS WILLARD AS A TEACHER.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Shortly</hi> after the death of Mary Willard, the <lb/>
Evanston home was broken up, Mr. and Mrs. <lb/>
Willard going first to Janesville and then to Chicago, <lb/>
<pb n="31" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0042"/>
and Oliver, their son, who married in July, 1862, <lb/>
settling in Denver, Colorado. Frances for a time <lb/>
taught the natural sciences at the North-Western <lb/>
Female College, but was getting into a very low and <lb/>
listless state of both mind and body, when a friend, <lb/>
the wife of Bishop Simpson, rescued her out of it by <lb/>
the proposition, backed by the offer of the Bishop <lb/>
himself, that she should try her fortune at the <reg orig="Pitts-|burg">Pittsburg</reg> <lb/>
Female College, of which he was President on <lb/>
the Board of Trustees.</p>
<p>Nothing particularly worthy of record here seems <lb/>
to have taken place during the months spent at <lb/>
Pittsburg. The diaries of this time are deeply tinged <lb/>
with the sadness of bereavement and loneliness. <lb/>
"I have the feeling," she writes, "of one who walks <lb/>
blindfold among scenes too awful for his nerves to <lb/>
bear, in the midst of which we eat and drink, wash <lb/>
our faces, and complain that the fire won't burn in the <lb/>
grate, or that the tea-bell doesn't ring in season. &hellip; <lb/>
We are like a spider's web in some remote angle of <lb/>
St. Peter's Cathedral. I suppose the cunning insects <lb/>
flurry greatly if a gnat flies past without being <lb/>
entrapped! All that appertains to the building from <lb/>
floor to dome is accidental in their sight."</p>
<p>On her return to her father and mother and <reg orig="Evans-|ton">Evanston</reg> <lb/>
in the summer vacation, Frances busied herself in <lb/>
writing that memoir of her sister to which we have <lb/>
already alluded. The manuscript, when finished, <lb/>
she herself carried to New York, under the escort of <lb/>
one of her father's friends, Mr. Willard's old-world <lb/>
notions as to the undesirability of publicity for women <lb/>
once more being overborne by his go-ahead and <lb/>
independent-spirited daughter. On her way thither, <lb/>
<pb n="32" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0043"/>
Frances saw the Falls of Niagara, and congratulates <lb/>
herself that she "did not drop into poetry, nor yet <lb/>
into prose, in the presence of that gleaming mystery."</p>
<p>The winter of 1865 finds the subject of our <reg orig="mono-|graph">monograph</reg> <lb/>
teaching the Grove School at Evanston, a select <lb/>
establishment founded by Mr. Edward Haskin, chiefly <lb/>
for the benefit of his own six children. Miss Willard's <lb/>
pupils here were "the best-born and best-mannered <lb/>
children at Evanston, kindly, quick-witted, and <lb/>
studious," and among them she first tried her <reg orig="dis-|ciplinary">disciplinary</reg> <lb/>
plan of "The Bank of Character."</p>
<p>The method was this. She opened an account with <lb/>
each student in her room, and put down certain <lb/>
balances in his favour. "Then by a system of cards <lb/>
of different values, which were interchangeable, as are <lb/>
our bank notes of different denominations, that is, <lb/>
one of a higher value being equivalent to several of a <lb/>
lower denomination, the plan was carried out. Every <lb/>
absence, tardiness, failure in recitation, case of <reg orig="whis-|pering">whispering</reg>, <lb/>
was subtracted from the bank account; and <lb/>
so emulous were those children, that my tallest boys <lb/>
were as much on the <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italic">qui vive</hi></foreign> to know their standing <lb/>
as were their youngest brothers."</p>
<p>In speaking of this time in after years, Miss Willard <lb/>
adds:&mdash;"As I grow older, however, I doubt more and <lb/>
more the propriety of offering prizes. Competition is <lb/>
so fierce in this country and age, and the 'set' of <lb/>
children's brains is so strong towards it from the first, <lb/>
that I have become an ardent believer in co-operation <lb/>
as a principle destined some day to overthrow the <lb/>
selfishness of competition, and, with my present views, <lb/>
would hardly re-enact the scenes that made the 'last <lb/>
day' so exciting at that school."</p>
<pb n="33" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0044"/>
<p>In the spring of 1866, owing to the development of <lb/>
the public school enterprise, Grove School, though <lb/>
eminently successful, ceased to exist, and once again <lb/>
Frances Willard went among strangers.</p>
<p>This time the scene of her labours was the town of <lb/>
Lima, Livingston Co., N.Y., and she was accompanied <lb/>
by her friend, Miss Kate Jackson, for whom she had <lb/>
secured the promise of French classes in the same <lb/>
place.</p>
<p>Here she seems to have been very comfortable, for <lb/>
she wrote, after the confession, which to us, looking <lb/>
at her history as a whole, is scarcely needed, that she <lb/>
was "an inveterate lover of variety":&mdash;"My life is a <lb/>
free and happy one&mdash;surfacely so. How strangely <lb/>
accommodating are our natures! With nothing just <lb/>
as I wish it; with chasms and voids in my life too <lb/>
numerous to name, I yet have a good time, and no <lb/>
complaint to make."</p>
<p>Still, "Change is our portion here" might have <lb/>
been the burden of Miss Willard's song. The greater <lb/>
part of 1867 was spent at home, helping to nurse her <lb/>
father in his long, last illness.</p>
<p>He died in January, 1868, full of joy and peace, <lb/>
and soon after this second bereavement, Frances <lb/>
willingly agreed to the proposal of her friend, Kate <lb/>
Jackson, that the two should together make the tour <lb/>
of Europe at the expense of the latter.</p>
<p>Thus it came about that for the next two years our <lb/>
heroine had the pleasure and advantage of travelling <lb/>
and studying abroad. The pair went through nearly <lb/>
every European country; northward "as far as <reg orig="Hel-|singfors">Helsingfors</reg>, <lb/>
Finland; east as far as the Volga banks in <lb/>
Russia, and Damascus in Syria; making the tour of <lb/>
<pb n="34" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0045"/>
Palestine, and going south far enough to look over <lb/>
into Nubia on earth, and up into the Southern Cross <lb/>
in the heavens."</p>
<p>While in Paris, Miss Willard studied under Guizot <lb/>
the younger, Laboulaye, and Chevalier.</p>
<p>It was very soon after her return that Miss Willard <lb/>
was induced to make her first attempt at lecturing in <lb/>
public. A gentleman who had heard her relate, at <lb/>
the meetings of the Women's Foreign Missionary <lb/>
Society at Chicago, some of her experiences in Egypt <lb/>
and the Holy Land, was struck with her evident gift <lb/>
for public speaking, and begged her to get up a <lb/>
lecture, for the success of which he would take the <lb/>
responsibility, offering her fifty dollars as prepayment.</p>
<p>Much as Miss Willard had longed for such an <lb/>
opportunity, she felt, now it had arrived, a little <lb/>
nervous about embracing it. But her mother said, <lb/>
"By all means, my child, accept; enter every open <lb/>
door." So, for the next few weeks, Frances was <lb/>
busily engaged writing and committing to memory a <lb/>
lecture on the subject that was nearest to her heart&mdash; <lb/>
that of the right of woman to "a fair chance to be all <lb/>
that God gave her power to be."</p>
<p>She called this lecture "The New Chivalry," and it <lb/>
was a great success, winning most flattering notices <lb/>
from the Chicago press.</p>
<p>The next important event in our heroine's life was <lb/>
her election to the position of President of the new <lb/>
Women's College at Evanston.</p>
<p>This institution, in which was merged the "<reg orig="North-|Western">North-Western</reg> <lb/>
Female College," where the sisters Willard <lb/>
had graduated some years before, was to be a thorough <lb/>
woman's college, "in which women should constitute <lb/>
<pb n="35" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0046"/>
the Board of Trustees, a woman should be president <lb/>
and confer diplomas, and women should be, for the <lb/>
first time, recognised and proved as the peers of men <lb/>
in administrative power."</p>
<p>It was opened in 1872, and here Miss Willard <lb/>
further developed her "Bank of Character" system <lb/>
of maintaining order. Filled with an instinctive <reg orig="ab-|horrence">abhorrence</reg> <lb/>
of rules and regulations herself, she heartily <lb/>
sympathised with girls of similarly independent spirit, <lb/>
and organised on their behalf her <hi rend="italic">"Roll of Honour"</hi> <lb/>
and <hi rend="italic">"Self-Governed"</hi> Societies.</p>
<p>The basis of this mode of discipline was, as she <lb/>
explained to parents and guardians, that "rules are <lb/>
for the unruly and regulations for the irregular," and <lb/>
the condition of being "not under the law, but under <lb/>
grace," the goal to be aimed at by every scholar. The <lb/>
ideal set before each pupil was, "<hi rend="italic">Just be a Christian <lb/>
Lady</hi>."</p>
<p>One month's absolute freedom from any occasion <lb/>
for reproof entitled a girl to have her name inscribed <lb/>
upon the Roll of Honour, and to be "invested with <lb/>
certain powers and responsibilities usually restricted <lb/>
to the faculty." After one entire term upon the Roll <lb/>
of Honour, uninterrupted by a single misdemeanour, <lb/>
she would be promoted to the ranks of the "<reg orig="Self-|Governed">Self-Governed</reg>," <lb/>
whose honours and privileges were, of <lb/>
course, proportionately greater.</p>
<p>The success of this original experiment was proved <lb/>
by the fact that at the end of one year twelve girls <lb/>
were on the Self-Governed List, and <hi rend="italic">all the others</hi> <lb/>
upon the Roll of Honour.</p>
<p>These were joyous days for the bright and <reg orig="dearly-|loved">dearly-loved</reg> <lb/>
President, who has herself laid it down as an <lb/>
<pb n="36" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0047"/>
axiom that "the highest form of human occupation <lb/>
is doing good according to a plan."</p>
<p>She had all the young ladies, numbering several <lb/>
hundreds, in her English Composition classes, one <lb/>
popular feature of which was reporting for the Chicago <lb/>
and Evanston papers; she lectured to her Art classes <lb/>
with the aid of numbers of beautiful photographic and <lb/>
stereoscopic views which she and Miss Jackson had <lb/>
brought home with them from their European travels; <lb/>
she opened and closed her recitations with a few <lb/>
words of prayer; a missionary society was organised <lb/>
in the College, and a short daily prayer-meeting, <lb/>
though voluntary, was "overwhelmingly attended."</p>
<p>One of her pupils at that time, afterwards the wife <lb/>
of a college president, thus says:&mdash;"In the most <lb/>
important part of her work as an educator &mdash; the <lb/>
development of character&mdash;I can speak from the most <lb/>
intimate knowledge. In this I doubt if she ever had <lb/>
a superior, and but for Arnold of Rugby I should <lb/>
have said, an equal. Her power over the girls who <lb/>
came under her influence was most extraordinary. <lb/>
It is an amusing fact that some people regarded it <lb/>
with a mixture of wonder and fear as something a <lb/>
little allied to witchcraft&mdash;an inexplicable spell not <lb/>
founded on reason."</p>
<p>But this halcyon period was too bright to last.</p>
<p>Dr. Haven, with whom, as President of the <reg orig="North-|Western">North-Western</reg> <lb/>
University, Miss Willard had so unanimously <lb/>
worked, was elected to fill another position, and his <lb/>
place was taken by the Rev. Dr. Fowler.</p>
<p>This gentleman did not entirely sympathise with <lb/>
Miss Willard's views as to "self-government," and <lb/>
friction was caused which eventually resulted in our <lb/>
<pb n="37" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0048"/>
heroine feeling that resignation of her appointment <lb/>
was her only course.</p>
<p>This, which she called the "greatest sacrifice" her <lb/>
life had known, or even could know, was made, after <lb/>
due deliberation and much anguish of spirit, in the <lb/>
summer of 1874, and its immediate outcome was the <lb/>
opening of the way for the greatest work of Frances <lb/>
Willard's life.</p>
<figure id="f8" rend="block" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0048"/>

<div2 type="chapter" n="IV" id="d18">
<head><hi rend="bold">CHAPTER IV. <lb/>
"THE UNCROWNED QUEEN."</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> year 1874 was memorable in Chicago as <lb/>
witnessing the commencement and growth of <lb/>
the Women's Temperance Crusade, and it was not <lb/>
long after Frances cut herself adrift from her work at <lb/>
Evanston University that, her anti-liquor sympathies <lb/>
being well known, she was offered and accepted the <lb/>
post of corresponding secretary to the Women's <lb/>
Christian Temperance Union.</p>
<p>Her first practical connection with the crusade was <lb/>
when, in Pittsburg, she walked with the procession <lb/>
of women, many of them ladies of birth and culture, <lb/>
who undertook to visit every drinking-saloon in the <lb/>
city, and sing hymns and pray outside its doors, or <lb/>
inside, if allowed.</p>
<p>On this occasion, the leader of the band having read <lb/>
a psalm at the bar of a saloon they had been <reg orig="per-|mitted">permitted</reg> <lb/>
to enter, Miss Willard was requested by her, <lb/>
after the singing of the "Rock of Ages," to offer up <lb/>
<pb n="38" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0049"/>
prayer; and she there and then knelt down in the <lb/>
sawdust on the floor, and feeling "not the least <reg orig="re-|luctance">reluctance</reg>," <lb/>
prayed more truly than she had ever done <lb/>
in her life before, except perhaps, she says, at her <lb/>
sister Mary's dying bed.</p>
<p>This was Miss Willard's "crusade baptism;" soon <lb/>
after she was appointed president of the Chicago <lb/>
W.C.T.U.</p>
<p>Declining the pecuniary assistance offered her, she, <lb/>
fired by the example of St. Francis d'Assisi, whom she <lb/>
greatly admired, for some months endeavoured to hold <lb/>
this position entirely without salary, dependent for her <lb/>
daily bread upon the small collections which were <lb/>
occasionally taken at her lectures, etc.</p>
<p>Her mother, though she did not entirely approve <lb/>
of this mendicant-friar business, did not at first <reg orig="dis-|courage">discourage</reg> <lb/>
her daughter's romantic method; may we <lb/>
hint that, perhaps she knew from experience that <lb/>
opposition would have been of little use. But <reg orig="by-|and-by">by-and-by</reg> <lb/>
when Frances went home, literally half-starved, <lb/>
almost shoeless, and downright ill from over-work <lb/>
and privation, she talked common-sense to her in the <lb/>
following strain:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I believe in faith as much as you do, but you <lb/>
have, with pure intention, yet ignorantly, flown in the <lb/>
face of Providence. Those good women spoke to you <lb/>
about a maintenance the very day they chose you <lb/>
president. That was your Heavenly Father's kind <lb/>
provision, and you turned away from it, and dictated <lb/>
to Him the method of His care. &hellip; God isn't going <lb/>
to start loaves of bread flying down the chimney, nor <lb/>
set the fire going in my stove without fuel. I shall <lb/>
soon see the bottom of my flour-barrel and coal-bin. <lb/>
<pb entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0050"/>

<head>"SHE KNELT DOWN IN THE SAWDUST ON THE FLOOR."</head>
</figure>
<pb entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0051"/>
<pb n="41" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0052"/>
Now write to those temperance women a plain <reg orig="state-|ment">statement</reg> <lb/>
of facts, and tell them that you have made the <lb/>
discovery that God works by means, and they may <lb/>
help you if they like."</p>
<p>Frances' letter to her comrades produced at once a <lb/>
loving response, with a cheque for 100 dollars <reg orig="en-|closed">enclosed</reg>. <lb/>
She saw her mistake; nevertheless, she <lb/>
always maintained that the period of her somewhat <lb/>
quixotic "faith test" was the loveliest and most <lb/>
blessed of her whole life. "I enjoyed the episode," <lb/>
she writes, "and shall be the better and richer for it <lb/>
evermore."</p>
<p>After working, writing, and speaking for two years <lb/>
in the interest of the Chicago &lpar;now advanced to the <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">National</hi>&rpar; W.C.T.U., it was borne in upon Miss <lb/>
Willard's mind that she was to "speak for woman's <lb/>
ballot, as a weapon of protection to her home and <lb/>
tempted loved ones from the tyranny of drink;" and <lb/>
she at once proposed to her colleagues that she should <lb/>
do so.</p>
<p>The idea was, however, met at first with much <lb/>
opposition. As one influential lady said, "We do <lb/>
not purpose to trail our skirts through the mire of <lb/>
politics."</p>
<p>In 1877, Miss Willard went to Washington, and <lb/>
there spoke before the House Committee on Judiciary, <lb/>
"urging the claims of the Home Protection Petition <lb/>
adopted at Newark, asking that, in the territories and <lb/>
the District of Columbia, the sale of alcoholic drinks <lb/>
should be legalised only 'when the majority of men <lb/>
by their votes, and women by their signatures, should <lb/>
ask for the legalising of such sale.'"</p>
<p>On her return to Chicago she undertook to go with <lb/>
<pb n="42" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0053"/>
the famous evangelist, Dwight L. Moody, to Boston, <lb/>
and help him with the women's meetings there.</p>
<p>In this cultured city Miss Willard held a daily <lb/>
Bible-reading for women, sometimes with an <reg orig="atten-|dance">attendance</reg> <lb/>
of a thousand or even fourteen hundred persons; <lb/>
and once she actually preached in Mr. Moody's <reg orig="taber-|nacle">tabernacle</reg> <lb/>
on a Sunday afternoon. Here also she became <lb/>
acquainted with Miss Bessie Gordon, and her sister, <lb/>
Anna, who was destined to be Miss Willard's <reg orig="com-|panion">companion</reg> <lb/>
and secretary for many subsequent years.</p>
<p>All went well, until our heroine was taken to task <lb/>
by the evangelist for appearing on a temperance <lb/>
platform with a lady who was known to hold <reg orig="Uni-|tarian">Unitarian</reg> <lb/>
views.</p>
<p>Miss Willard was too large of heart and broad <lb/>
of mind to submit readily to such a restriction as this. <lb/>
She wrote to him, after due consideration, a letter on <lb/>
the subject, of which this is the gist:&mdash;"I fail to see <lb/>
that it is for us to decide who shall work in this cause <lb/>
side by side with us, and who shall not. I cannot <lb/>
judge how the hearts of earnest, pure, prayerful <lb/>
women may appear in God's clear sight."</p>
<p>This liberality of thought reminds us of her reply <lb/>
to the question whether she condemned theatres, or <lb/>
those who go to them. "I do not condemn anyone," <lb/>
she said, "who with a clear and enlightened <reg orig="con-|science">conscience</reg> <lb/>
goes anywhere."</p>
<p>Once again, as many times before and after, <lb/>
Miss Willard found that she must, in following the <lb/>
dictates of her own judgment run counter to the <lb/>
advice of some of her most valued friends. These <lb/>
thought that in disconnecting herself from Mr. <lb/>
Moody she was letting slip a splendid opportunity <lb/>
<pb n="43" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0054"/>
for extending the work of the W.C.T.U. But their <lb/>
arguments were of no avail. Freedom&mdash;that liberty <lb/>
of thought, speech, and action which she was ever <lb/>
ready to fight for and accord to others &mdash; was to <lb/>
Frances Willard as the breath of life. "The jacket," <lb/>
she writes &lpar;of Mr. Moody's theological <reg orig="interpreta-|tions&rpar;">interpretations&rpar;</reg> <lb/>
"was too straight. I could not wear it."</p>
<p>It was in 1877, at the Annual Convention at <lb/>
Chicago, that the now world-famed "white ribbon" <lb/>
was first adopted as the badge of the W.C.T.U., the <lb/>
colour being emblematic of purity and peace, on the <lb/>
principle of "first pure, then peaceable."</p>
<p>At the same Convention, Miss Willard for a time <lb/>
resigned the corresponding secretaryship of this <lb/>
Society, owing to the nomination of an alternative <lb/>
candidate for the post, a greatly respected friend of her <lb/>
own, whom she did not choose to oppose. But the <lb/>
following year the White Ribbon Regiment of Illinois <lb/>
placed her at its head, and entering at once upon <lb/>
their Home Protection campaign, they in nine weeks <lb/>
collected nearly two hundred thousand signatures to a <lb/>
petition that women should be accorded the privilege <lb/>
of voting when the question of licensing the sale of <lb/>
intoxicating drinks was being anywhere discussed.</p>
<p>This petition produced no effect upon the <reg orig="legis-|lature">legislature</reg>, <lb/>
but it so aroused the people, that out of 832 <lb/>
towns voting that spring under the local option law, <lb/>
625 declared themselves for prohibition, which the <lb/>
White Ribboners felt to be worth striving for.</p>
<p>Just about this period came a third severe <reg orig="bereave-|ment">bereavement</reg> <lb/>
upon Miss Willard, very suddenly, in the death, <lb/>
after only a day or two of apparently slight <reg orig="indisposi-|tion">indisposition</reg>, <lb/>
of her beloved brother, Oliver.</p>
<pb n="44" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0055"/>
<p>This gentleman, "of whose great gifts and genial <lb/>
nature," writes his sister, "I can never say enough," <lb/>
had for some years occupied the responsible position <lb/>
of editor, first of the <hi rend="italic">Chicago Mail,</hi> and afterwards of <lb/>
the <hi rend="italic">Chicago Post.</hi></p>
<p>The news of his death was conveyed in a telegram <lb/>
to Miss Willard just as she was preparing to conduct <lb/>
a temperance prayer-meeting at the town of Saginaw, <lb/>
Michigan, which she was visiting at the time. It <lb/>
would be impossible for her to get a train for Chicago <lb/>
until an hour which would permit of the fulfilment of <lb/>
her engagement first, if she so desired, and thinking, <lb/>
"<hi rend="italic">He</hi> would have wished me to do this," the heroic <lb/>
woman mastered her first passion of grief sufficiently <lb/>
to go to the prayer-meeting as appointed, where <lb/>
she and her audience, whom she told of her sorrow, <lb/>
"cried together, praying and talking of a better life, <lb/>
which is a heavenly."</p>
<p>On returning home, Miss Willard at once took <lb/>
upon herself, with her widowed sister-in-law, the task <lb/>
of continuing the superintendence of the editors, <lb/>
reporters, proof-readers, compositors, etc., a force of <lb/>
more than sixty persons in all, who were engaged in <lb/>
the production of the <hi rend="italic">Chicago Evening Post.</hi></p>
<p>It was a stupendous undertaking for two women, <lb/>
neither of whom possessed any editorial experience, <lb/>
and, in spite of all their hard work and energy, it had, <lb/>
in a short time, to be relinquished, and stands out <lb/>
conspicuously in Miss Willard's history as the only <lb/>
positive failure among all her efforts.</p>
<p>After this, she started on a Temperance tour in the <lb/>
South, where having, as a Northerner, been prepared <lb/>
for somewhat scant sympathy, she was amazed and <lb/>
<pb n="45" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0056"/>
delighted by the cordiality of her reception; indeed, it <lb/>
would appear from the records of that royal progress <lb/>
through nearly one hundred towns and cities of the <lb/>
South, that the people were even more readily <reg orig="respon-|sive">responsive</reg> <lb/>
to the appeals of Miss Willard and her helpers <lb/>
than in the more cool-blooded and beer-ridden North. <lb/>
She felt that the breach left by the war between the <lb/>
two halves of the great American continent could be <lb/>
by nothing so well bridged over as by the uniting <lb/>
of the temperance men of both North and South in <lb/>
voting for the prohibition of the liquor traffic.</p>
<p>In 1881, Miss Willard resolved to identify herself <lb/>
unreservedly with the Prohibition party, whether <lb/>
composed mainly of Republicans or Democrats. <lb/>
Although hitherto her sympathies had been staunchly <lb/>
Republican, she now felt that the cause of Home <lb/>
Protection and the Prohibition of the drink traffic <lb/>
was of greater moral importance than anything else, <lb/>
and, with many others of similar convictions, she <lb/>
retired from the Republican party to become a <lb/>
member of the Central Committee of the newly <reg orig="re-|organised">reorganised</reg> <lb/>
"Prohibition Home Protection Party." <lb/>
In her official address to the W.C.T.U. she eloquently <lb/>
pleaded with its members to throw the whole weight <lb/>
of their influence into the same balance.</p>
<p>Much time and energy in 1883 were expended by <lb/>
Miss Willard in completing the visitation of every <lb/>
one of the forty-eight States in the Union, with every <lb/>
town therein which had, according to the census of <lb/>
1870, 10,000 inhabitants, and many much smaller ones.</p>
<p>This grand tour was finished in the autumn of the <lb/>
above year, an event which was celebrated at Detroit <lb/>
with great rejoicings.</p>
<pb n="46" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0057"/>
<p>Then another expansion of the W.C.T.U. was <lb/>
decided upon, and it became the "<hi rend="italic">World's</hi> Woman's <lb/>
Christian Temperance Union," of which gigantic <lb/>
Union Miss Willard in due course became President, <lb/>
a position she held until her death. The <reg orig="ramifica-|tions">ramifications</reg> <lb/>
of this great force were extended by degrees <lb/>
to Australia, India, China, Madeira, Madagascar, <lb/>
Siam, Straits Settlements, Corea, Japan, and, in fact, <lb/>
everywhere.</p>
<p>During the next few years Miss Willard's life is <lb/>
the story of a noble, persistent struggle on the part <lb/>
of herself and the Union which she represented, to <lb/>
gain the ear and the sympathy of the legislature. <lb/>
Meetings were held, speeches made, petitions framed <lb/>
at every possible opportunity. But smaller matters <lb/>
relating to the freedom and welfare of home and <lb/>
woman, were not overlooked; as an example, witness <lb/>
the petition adopted by the St. Louis Convention <lb/>
and sent to the editors of fashion-papers, begging <lb/>
them to discountenance in their pages such plates <lb/>
as represented and encouraged unnatural constriction <lb/>
of the waist, and lend their "aid toward the elevation <lb/>
of woman to a more perfect physical estate" by <lb/>
making the figures depicted "conform more nearly <lb/>
to the normal standard and the conditions requisite <lb/>
for the maintenance of health."</p>
<p>Miss Willard was always an earnest advocate of <lb/>
the duty of endeavouring to preserve a sound body <lb/>
as the garment of a sound mind. Busy as was her <lb/>
life she contrived to maintain a wise regularity of <lb/>
habit, which, considering her natural delicacy of <lb/>
physique, probably contributed not a little towards <lb/>
the lengthening of her life until a fair middle age, <lb/>
<pb n="47" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0058"/>
while both her sister and her brother, doubtless <lb/>
inheriting with her their father's weakness of <reg orig="con-|stitution">constitution</reg>, <lb/>
died without numbering half their days.</p>
<p>"My rising-hour," she writes, "has long been from <lb/>
seven to half-past &lpar;I wish it were earlier!&rpar; and retiring <lb/>
anywhere from half-past seven to half-past nine; but <lb/>
when travelling, it has been about ten. I regard <lb/>
that hour as the dead line of recuperation, vigour, <lb/>
and sustained mental activity. Eight hours of <lb/>
writing and study, all of them between breakfast <lb/>
and tea, has been my rule. After the evening meal <lb/>
at six o'clock I will not work&mdash;lecturing, of course, <lb/>
excepted. I expect, as a rule, to sit at my desk from <lb/>
8.30 or 9 A.M. until 6 P.M. daily, with a half-hour's <lb/>
interval from 12.30 to 1, and an outing of about <reg orig="half-|an-hour">half-an-hour</reg>. <lb/>
I never touch the pen after tea, and ten <lb/>
o'clock finds our house dark as a pocket, silent as <lb/>
a tomb, and restful as a cradle."</p>
<p>It is a noteworthy fact that Miss Willard never <lb/>
in all her life suffered from insomnia. She calls <lb/>
herself "one of the seven sleepers," and even in the <lb/>
trying and exciting days of endeavouring to keep up <lb/>
her brother's newspaper, the anxiety never deprived <lb/>
her of her ability to rest at night.</p>
<p>It was in 1891 that our heroine first became <lb/>
acquainted with Lady Henry Somerset, from <lb/>
thenceforward to be her dear friend and valued <lb/>
coadjutor.</p>
<p>Lady Henry was visiting America in her official <lb/>
capacity of President of the British Women's <lb/>
Temperance Association, and was introduced to <lb/>
Miss Willard by the well-known Quakeress preacher <lb/>
and writer, Hannah Whittall Smith.</p>
<pb n="48" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0059"/>
<p>This lady greatly desired her two much admired <lb/>
friends to be acquainted, and attempted to pave the <lb/>
way by praising each of them to the other in a generous, <lb/>
but perhaps hardly judicious fashion, for Lady <lb/>
Henry quietly remarked when Frances Willard's <lb/>
virtues and attractiveness were being thus extolled, <lb/>
that "much-praised people were usually <reg orig="disappoint-|ing">disappointing</reg>." <lb/>
However, the English lady shortly after had <lb/>
an opportunity of meeting the American in the flesh, <lb/>
and, said the Quakeress afterwards, "They had not <lb/>
been together five minutes before I saw they were <lb/>
made for each other; both were delighted, and so <lb/>
was I."</p>
<p>Lady Henry Somerset has herself thus described <lb/>
that meeting:&mdash;</p>
<p>"In October, 1891, I stood for the first time on <lb/>
the platform of the railway station in the 'classic <lb/>
town' of Evanston. I had only landed in America <lb/>
a few weeks, but my steps were naturally bent to the <lb/>
Mecca of White Ribboners. &hellip; Like all Temperance <lb/>
women, good and true, I had placed Miss Willard's <lb/>
image in my inmost shrine; and yet as the train <lb/>
glided towards Evanston, I felt that our idols seem <lb/>
made to be shattered, and this one also might possibly <lb/>
shortly be dashed to the ground. On the platform <lb/>
she awaited my coming&mdash;a delicate, fragile figure, <lb/>
in a pretty blue dress, her small hand shading her <lb/>
eyes as she looked about attentively seeking her <lb/>
guest, and as she came toward me I saw a face so <lb/>
kind and frank that it seemed as though the peaceful <lb/>
simplicity of childhood had somehow remained <reg orig="un-|ruffled">unruffled</reg> <lb/>
by the chilling blasts of life. &hellip; From that <lb/>
hour I have felt that we were friends&mdash;friends not <lb/>
<pb n="49" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0060"/>
only to joy in each other's companionship, but in that <lb/>
truer sense that binds souls."</p>
<p>The following year, Miss Willard came to England <lb/>
as the guest of her new friend, and in the grounds of <lb/>
Reigate Priory, being then fifty-three years of age, <lb/>
she mastered the bicycle presented to her by Lady <lb/>
Henry, as she had been recommended physical <lb/>
exercise along with mental rest. The various stages <lb/>
of her progress towards the accomplishment of this <lb/>
by no means easy task, are described most <reg orig="enter-|tainingly">entertainingly</reg> <lb/>
and with thoughtful little moral lessons <lb/>
deduced therefrom, in Miss Willard's booklet, "A <lb/>
Wheel within a Wheel."</p>
<p>Every summer after that, until 1896, the "<reg orig="Un-|crowned">Uncrowned</reg> <lb/>
Queen" of the United States, as owing to <lb/>
her immense influence over the people of her own <lb/>
country she has been not inappropriately called, paid <lb/>
a visit to Lady Somerset's charming home. In <lb/>
January, 1893, she received a public and most <reg orig="en-|thusiastic">enthusiastic</reg> <lb/>
welcome to this country, and every year <lb/>
she became better known and more warmly loved on <lb/>
this side of the Atlantic.</p>
<p>An Englishwoman&mdash;"One who knew her," thus <lb/>
writes:&mdash;"In five minutes I was fairly conquered by <lb/>
Miss Willard's gracious, genial, simple manner. &hellip; <lb/>
At the bottom of her captivating manner lay a great <lb/>
belief in the goodness of human nature. People <lb/>
turned their best side to her, much as a flower turns <lb/>
to the sun. &hellip; Her humour constantly bubbled over. <lb/>
She looked over her gold pince-nez, a glint in her <lb/>
fine blue eyes, and uttered some quaint conceit in <lb/>
her quiet way, much amusing the company. Nor <lb/>
was she one of those who are only bright and witty <lb/>
<pb n="50" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0061"/>
in society; to get her alone was quite a treat, for she <lb/>
always gave of her best."</p>
<p>As regards the financial success of Miss Willard's <lb/>
life, concerning which some may feel curious, she has <lb/>
in her autobiography thus recorded:&mdash;"Though I <lb/>
have earned tens of thousands of dollars, I have <lb/>
nothing except Rose Cottage, the joint inheritance <lb/>
of my mother and myself, and finally to revert, after <lb/>
a tenure of 'life use,' to the National W.C.T.U.; to <lb/>
be employed by that Association for the purpose of <lb/>
training boys and girls to habits of physical purity, <lb/>
with especial reference to personal chastity and the <lb/>
non-use, in any form, of alcoholics and narcotics. &hellip; <lb/>
I believe that 'the love of money is the root of all <lb/>
evil:' that it has warped and minimised more lives, <lb/>
turned more homes into small compacts of perdition, <lb/>
and defeated the Gospel's blessed purpose more <lb/>
ingeniously than all other curses that ever crazed <lb/>
the human heart."</p>
<p>With a few more brief extracts from that volume <lb/>
to which we have already been so largely indebted, <lb/>
we must draw our memoir to a close,&mdash;extracts in <lb/>
which the clear bright mind and sweet spirit of the <lb/>
writer reflects itself.</p>
<p>"Doubtless, in early days, when the conflict was <lb/>
between idolatry and the worship of God, 'Divine <lb/>
service' may have rightly consisted largely in sermon, <lb/>
song, and prayer; but to call that 'service' now, as <lb/>
is universally done, seems to me a mockery. That <lb/>
is a delight, a coveted and blessed means of growth; <lb/>
but 'service' now is to our fellow-men, and he whose <lb/>
purse and work are not invested there knows nothing <lb/>
about 'Divine service,' and might well name his place <lb/>
<pb n="51" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0062"/>
of Sunday lounging and &aelig;sthetics the 'Church of the <lb/>
Divine Emptiness,' or 'The Church of the Celestial <lb/>
Sugar Plum.'</p>
<p>"I hold that word 'anxiety' to be strongly <lb/>
atheistic, and have endeavoured to weed it out of <lb/>
my vocabulary. 'Careful for nothing, and in <hi rend="italic"><reg orig="every-|thing">everything</reg></hi> <lb/>
a giver of thanks,' is what the commonest <lb/>
sort of a Christian is sacredly bound to be, or to <lb/>
become.</p>
<p>"What the world most needs is mothering, and <lb/>
most of all in the Spirit's natural home, the Church, <lb/>
and on the Sabbath day. &hellip; The <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italic">sine qu&acirc; non</hi></foreign> of <lb/>
our success is mutual faith and fellowship. We must <lb/>
'have fervent charity among ourselves.' It is not <lb/>
uncharitable to judge an act as good or bad, but we <lb/>
should be very slow to judge the actor bad.</p>
<p>"'Lord Jesus, receive my spirit,' is the deepest <lb/>
voice out of my soul. Receive it every instant, <lb/>
voluntarily given back to Thyself, and receive it in <lb/>
the hour when I drop this earthly mantle that I wear <lb/>
to-day, and pass onward to the world invisible, but <lb/>
doubtless not far off."</p>
<p>Miss Willard did not come again to England after <lb/>
the autumn of 1896. Her health was failing <reg orig="con-|siderably">considerably</reg>, <lb/>
and even the months spent at a sanatorium <lb/>
in New Castile did not permanently restore her <lb/>
strength. She, however, attended the W.W.C.T.U. <lb/>
Convention at Toronto and Buffalo in 1897, declaring <lb/>
herself, in her ever brave and cheery way, to be "none <lb/>
the worse for it."</p>
<p>Towards the close of that year she went to New <lb/>
<pb n="52" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0063"/>
York for a few weeks, where the proprietor of the <lb/>
Royal Empire Hotel insisted that she should be his <lb/>
guest.</p>
<p>Here she was attacked by influenza, on which <lb/>
ensued dangerous gastric complications. There is <lb/>
no doubt that her delicate frame had been broken <lb/>
down by years of overwork, for without any warning <lb/>
the news was a few days later flashed to her friends <lb/>
all over the world that Frances Willard was dead.</p>
<p>Mrs. Willard had passed away in 1891 at the <lb/>
advanced age of eighty-seven, and this last and most <lb/>
nobly famous of her children followed her on the <lb/>
17th of February, 1898. A few months later the <lb/>
mortal remains of the "Uncrowned Queen" were <lb/>
cremated, in accordance with her repeatedly expressed <lb/>
wish, and interred in the family grave at Rose Hill <lb/>
Cemetery.</p>

STRONG, FOR GOOD OR ILL.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Wherever</hi> power, which is strength in <lb/>
action, exists, it must inevitably make itself <lb/>
known. Wind, water, steam&mdash;every force <lb/>
of Nature, must have an outlet, and the strength of <lb/>
character with which some children are endowed from <lb/>
birth shows itself at an early age. This is probably <lb/>
the origin of the belief that the most troublesome boys <lb/>
make the finest men.</p>
<p>This, however, is not true, as some fond parents <lb/>
mistakenly imagine, of the perverse vagaries of the <lb/>
spoiled child&mdash;the tyrant in embryo&mdash;but only of the <lb/>
boys or girls who, teeming with ideas and overflowing <lb/>
with energy, find it hard to learn self-restraint and <lb/>
obedience to the wishes of those whose judgment and <lb/>
experience are more ripe than their own.</p>
<p>The eagerness must be curbed, the impetuosity <lb/>
restrained, the energies directed into right channels, <lb/>
and many are the conflicts which occur between the <lb/>
child and the parent, the pupil and the teacher, ay, <lb/>
<pb n="56" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0067"/>
and between the higher and lower nature of the <reg orig="sub-|ject">subject</reg> <lb/>
himself, ere the victory for right alone is won.</p>
<p>Naturally gentle and "biddable" children, who are <lb/>
always inclined to wait to be led, either by their elders <lb/>
or more go-ahead playmates, know nothing of this <lb/>
warfare, nor of the bitter tears which are shed by the <lb/>
vanquished or the penitent. They also have their <lb/>
place in the world&mdash;in God's great garden there is <lb/>
room for the tender creeper as well as the sturdy shrub <lb/>
&mdash;but they will never "make their mark" upon society, <lb/>
nor powerfully sway, either for good or evil, the <lb/>
generation into which they are born.</p>
<p>We are not, therefore, surprised to learn that Agnes <lb/>
Weston as a child was "for some years a source of <lb/>
great anxiety to her parents;" and that her "strong <lb/>
will and passionate temper had need of much careful <lb/>
training."</p>
<p>Happily, both for herself and the thousands to <lb/>
whom she has been made a blessing, that training was <lb/>
bestowed upon her.</p>
<p>Miss Weston's father, a barrister, and a man of <lb/>
much scientific culture, was an earnest and humble <lb/>
Christian, who delighted to use his knowledge and his <lb/>
talents to glorify God by showing the wonders of His <lb/>
infinite skill in the heavens and on earth. It is <reg orig="need-|less">needless</reg> <lb/>
to say that his daughter was the child of many <lb/>
prayers, and reared under the inestimable influences <lb/>
of noble example.</p>
<p>Mrs. Weston, who died in 1895 at the advanced <lb/>
age of eighty-four years, was always "all that was <lb/>
loving, true and good."</p>
<p>"Although," adds her daughter, "weak and <reg orig="suffer-|ing">suffering</reg> <lb/>
in health, she always so forgot her own trials that <lb/>
<pb n="57" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0068"/>
she made home the brightest, happiest place in the <lb/>
world for her children. She won their confidence and <lb/>
love, and kept it to her latest breath. Singularly gifted, <lb/>
and endowed with a sweet personal presence, she used <lb/>
all in her Master's service."</p>
<p>Quite late in life, when many would have excused <lb/>
themselves from self-denial on account of the <reg orig="infir-|mities">infirmities</reg> <lb/>
of old age, Mrs. Weston, under the influence <lb/>
of an address by Canon Basil Wilberforce, signed the <lb/>
total abstinence pledge, which she kept unbroken until <lb/>
the day of her death, nearly twenty years afterwards.</p>
<p>No wonder that Miss Weston herself should exclaim, <lb/>
"Woe to me, if with such a father and mother, and <lb/>
with such home influences, I had been aught but a <lb/>
child of God and a worker in His vineyard!"</p>
<p>Training, however, does but guide; it cannot alter, <lb/>
much less create, the natural bent of temperament and <lb/>
disposition. Agnes Weston's vigour and energy, her <lb/>
love of fighting opposition and surmounting difficulties, <lb/>
were her birthright.</p>
<p>A friend of her father, a phrenologist, on examining <lb/>
the exterior signs of the child's cerebral development, <lb/>
prophesied that her career would be a remarkable one. <lb/>
He further expressed his conviction that a crisis would <lb/>
some day occur in her life, when she would "turn <lb/>
decisively either to the right or left, would choose to <lb/>
be great either in the service of God or that of the <lb/>
world."</p>
<p>Those who believe that mental superiority is an <lb/>
evidence of "good blood" and noble origin, will be <lb/>
interested to learn that the ancestors of the subject of <lb/>
this sketch were actually among the aristocratic <lb/>
Normans who "came over with William the <reg orig="Con-|queror">Conqueror</reg>;" <lb/>
<pb n="58" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0069"/>
the first of the name of whom record exists <lb/>
being Raoul de Bailleul de Weston, the English-<reg orig="sound-|ing">sounding</reg> <lb/>
suffix relating, we presume, to the lands and manors <lb/>
wherewith the great Norman rewarded his loyal <lb/>
follower. In any case, it is worth noting that the <lb/>
family seems to have been distinguished by remarkable <lb/>
force of character from that remote time until the <lb/>
present.</p>
<p>Agnes Weston did nothing by halves. She was <lb/>
always "out and out" either for good or bad.</p>
<p>Up to the age of sixteen, though brought up amid <lb/>
such eminently Christian surroundings, she was not <lb/>
merely formal and lifeless in the performance of <lb/>
religious duties, she absolutely ignored the commonest <lb/>
means of grace&mdash;save that of attendance at Divine <lb/>
worship, which was doubtless more or less <reg orig="compul-|sory,&mdash;but">compulsory,&mdash;but</reg> <lb/>
Bible-reading and private prayer were <lb/>
utterly neglected. Not only passively, like so many <lb/>
people, but actively irreligious did this young girl <lb/>
appear.</p>
<p>It was by the ministry of the Rev. James, now <lb/>
Canon, Fleming, that Agnes Weston's conscience first <lb/>
became awakened. He was appointed to the <reg orig="incum-|bency">incumbency</reg> <lb/>
of All Saints' Chapel, Bath, to which town the <lb/>
Westons, while Agnes was yet an infant, had from <lb/>
London removed.</p>
<p>Strange that the instinct of combativeness, which <lb/>
phrenologists tell us is the source of most of the <lb/>
active good that is accomplished in the world, should <lb/>
in its crude condition have at once impelled Miss <lb/>
Weston to violently oppose the working of God's <lb/>
Holy Spirit! Startling, indeed, is it to read from her <lb/>
own pen such a confession as this:&mdash;</p>
<pb n="59" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0070"/>
<p>"I was obliged to go to church, but I was <reg orig="deter-|mined">determined</reg> <lb/>
not to listen, and oftentimes when the preacher <lb/>
gave out the text, I have stopped my ears, and shut <lb/>
my eyes that I might neither see nor hear."</p>
<p>But the Heavenly Father would not give up His <lb/>
child, the Shepherd would not cease to follow and <lb/>
patiently call to the lamb that was lost.</p>
<p>The loving parents kept on praying, Mr. Fleming, <lb/>
little guessing how strong, yet rebellious a soul was <lb/>
struggling against his home-thrusts, continued to <lb/>
preach God's truth, a good Christian friend helped <lb/>
in the work, and presently the armour of obstinate <lb/>
repugnance began to yield.</p>
<p>Agnes was persuaded to read the Bible for herself <lb/>
and to think about it.</p>
<p>For hours, then, we are told, she used to wander <lb/>
about the fields, Bible in hand, and many a night she <lb/>
was sleepless from agony of soul.</p>
<p>It really seems as though Satan, foreseeing the <lb/>
incalculable injury to his work that would ensue if <lb/>
once he let this vigorous character, this large heart and <lb/>
busy mind, escape into the ranks of the Saviour's <lb/>
host, put forth all his efforts to entangle and <reg orig="dis-|courage">discourage</reg> <lb/>
her, raging to hold her back.</p>
<p>He bewildered her with doubts, he tortured her <lb/>
with the paralysing suggestions of scepticism, he <lb/>
terrified her by pointing to a broken law. He used <lb/>
every art "acquired," as we once heard a preacher <lb/>
remark, "in his 6000 years of experience" in deceiving <lb/>
humanity, to baffle her in her search for light and <lb/>
peace. She was worth fighting for!</p>
<p>But the Victor over all was too strong for him; <lb/>
Agnes had at last yielded herself to the guidance of <lb/>
<pb n="60" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0071"/>
the Holy Spirit, so soon or late, all must be well with <lb/>
her. Yet the conflict was drear and long.</p>
<p>It was during this time of inward unrest that she <lb/>
commenced, with her usual irresistible energy, the <lb/>
mastery of the organ, preferring, characteristically, that <lb/>
instrument to any other, because of the difficulty of <lb/>
manipulating it.</p>
<p>For some time she studied under the late J. R. Pyne, <lb/>
Esq., organist of the Abbey Church, Bath; wrestling <lb/>
with technicalities and practising with a perseverance <lb/>
that was only checked by the endurance of the <reg orig="organ-|blower">organ-blower</reg>, <lb/>
whose strength was often unequal to the <lb/>
industry of the student.</p>
<p>At the recommendation of Mr. Pyne, who thought <lb/>
highly of his pupil's ability, Miss Weston was enabled <lb/>
to place herself after a while under the tuition of that <lb/>
celebrated organist and composer, Dr. S. S. Wesley, <lb/>
of Gloucester Cathedral; and for a time she might be <lb/>
found every day, and nearly all day, seated at the <lb/>
cathedral organ, preparing herself unconsciously for <lb/>
the work in after life which was being prepared for her.</p>
<p>It is to this period that an incident pertains which <lb/>
well illustrates Miss Weston's courage and resolution.</p>
<p>Dr. Wesley was one evening giving her a lesson in <lb/>
the cathedral after dark; no lights were allowed <lb/>
except in the organ-loft, the remainder of the vast, <lb/>
echoing building being engulfed in darkness.</p>
<p>Dr. Wesley was summoned away in haste by a <lb/>
messenger from home soon after the lesson began, but <lb/>
he promised to speedily return. He was compelled, <lb/>
however, to lock the young lady alone in the cathedral <lb/>
during his absence, as it was against rule to leave the <lb/>
doors open. But to this she did not in the least object.</p>
<pb n="61" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0072"/>
<p>Dr. Wesley had not been gone long, before even <lb/>
Miss Weston's absorption in her occupation was <reg orig="dis-|turbed">disturbed</reg> <lb/>
by the sound, real or imagined, of footsteps on <lb/>
the stones of the aisle below. Slowly but surely they <lb/>
drew nearer, and to the performer's horror, paused in <lb/>
the side chapel at the foot of the organ loft! She <lb/>
knew it was not her tutor's familiar tread, and the <lb/>
stories of the ghost of a certain Crusader, by which <lb/>
the dim, mysterious pile was said to be haunted, came <lb/>
rushing into her mind.</p>
<p>But Agnes Weston was not one to sit still and <lb/>
tremble; she must up and <hi rend="italic">do!</hi> She sprang to <lb/>
her feet, threw aside the curtain and saw&mdash;nothing!</p>
<p>The strange sounds, she concluded, were occasioned <lb/>
probably by the wind sobbing around the pillars and <lb/>
tombs in the cloisters and aisle; and reassured she <lb/>
went quietly on with her practising until Dr. Wesley <lb/>
appeared.</p>
<p>True foreshadowing of the pluck and determination <lb/>
with which in after years she would face obstacles, both <lb/>
tangible and visionary, and by which many a dark <lb/>
spectre of ignorance, godlessness and intemperance <lb/>
should be put to the rout.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">It</hi> was not until after nearly ten years of struggle <lb/>
and strife that Agnes Weston found her "desired <lb/>
haven" of rest and peace in Jesus Christ.</p>
<pb n="62" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0073"/>
<p>The hushing of the storm was so gradual, the return <lb/>
of the tempest for a long time so recurrent, that the <lb/>
exact date when calm commenced its final reign <lb/>
cannot be definitely given; but by the year 1868 we <lb/>
find Miss Weston actively and happily engaged in <lb/>
various forms of Christian work, teaching the young, <lb/>
visiting the sick, and ministering to the dying.</p>
<p>We are quite prepared to hear that in the Sunday <lb/>
school her force of character and love of difficulty <lb/>
brought every unruly class in turn beneath her firm <lb/>
but kindly hand, and that "the more unmanageable <lb/>
they were, the more she delighted in, as the curate <lb/>
expressed it, 'licking them into shape.'"</p>
<p>Of course, she loved big boys! The future <lb/>
"mother" of Jack Tar could not do otherwise. And <lb/>
by degrees her class of senior lads developed into a <lb/>
class for working-men, and this in turn was the <lb/>
nucleus of her mission work at Walcot, near Bath, <lb/>
where Working-Men's Bible-Classes and <reg orig="Prayer-|meetings">Prayer-meetings</reg>, <lb/>
Temperance and Band of Hope efforts <lb/>
were crowned with much blessing.</p>
<p>For Miss Weston was a staunch advocate of <lb/>
Temperance even before she had herself signed the <lb/>
pledge. The story of how it came about that she <lb/>
was induced to make that decisive stand has often <lb/>
been related, but it is so good, and carries so striking <lb/>
a lesson to other Christian workers, as to be worth <lb/>
telling again.</p>
<p>At the close of one of her Temperance meetings, <lb/>
a notorious drunkard came up to the table and wished <lb/>
to sign the pledge.</p>
<p>Miss Weston was delighted, but her triumph was <lb/>
soon checked, for as the man held the pen in his <lb/>
<pb n="63" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0074"/>
hand, before he began to write, he suddenly looked <lb/>
up at her and asked:&mdash;</p>
<p>"If you please, Miss Weston, be <hi rend="italic">you</hi> a teetotaller?"</p>
<p>Somewhat taken aback by this unexpected query, <lb/>
Miss Weston replied, "I only take a glass of wine <lb/>
occasionally, and in strict moderation."</p>
<p>The man at once laid down the pen, saying that <lb/>
he would do the same, and take a glass sometimes <lb/>
"in moderation."</p>
<p>Needless to say, this was to him impossible, and <lb/>
he soon plunged back into his old ways.</p>
<p>"That night," adds Miss Weston, "I saw my duty <lb/>
very plainly, and I enrolled my name in the <reg orig="pledge-|book">pledge-book</reg>, <lb/>
heartily wishing that I had done so before."</p>
<p>The assembling of the Somerset Militia every year <lb/>
at Bath, for training, was the cause of Miss Weston <lb/>
becoming interested in soldiers,&mdash;for the time of the <lb/>
sailors, though approaching, had not yet fully come.</p>
<p>When coffee and reading-rooms were started for <lb/>
the benefit of the men, she naturally took great <lb/>
interest in them, and frequently assisted at the <lb/>
meetings which were arranged for recreation. She <lb/>
also undertook a Sunday Bible-class, and the result <lb/>
of her efforts became so apparent in the improved <lb/>
behaviour of the men, that as one officer testified, <lb/>
they were "not like the same fellows."</p>
<p>From Tommy Atkins it is but a step to his <lb/>
brother, Jack Tar, and this is how, in Miss Weston's <lb/>
case, that step was taken.</p>
<p>In that same eventful year, 1868, she wrote a <lb/>
friendly letter to a soldier of her acquaintance who <lb/>
was on his way to India. The man, proud and <lb/>
pleased, showed the letter to one of the seamen, <lb/>
<pb n="64" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0075"/>
a sick-berth steward, evoking the longing comment, <lb/>
"I would give anything if I could get a letter like <lb/>
that sometimes! Do you think that lady would <lb/>
write to me?"</p>
<p>"I am sure she would. I will write and ask her," <lb/>
replied the other.</p>
<p>He did so. Miss Weston gladly answered it, <lb/>
complying with his request. And that letter to one <lb/>
friendless seaman, yearning for sympathy, on board <lb/>
the <hi rend="italic">Crocodile,</hi> was the germ of her present stupendous <lb/>
and world-wide labour among sailors.</p>
<p>For the next thing was that the grateful fellow <lb/>
wrote to her himself, enclosing the names of several <lb/>
other sailors who would be as thankful for a letter <lb/>
as he was. She penned kindly, encouraging epistles <lb/>
to them all, and week by week her correspondence <lb/>
steadily increased.</p>
<p>At last the requests for these much-prized letters <lb/>
became so numerous that it was impossible to keep <lb/>
pace with them except by the regular supplementary <lb/>
issue of a printed one. Thus Miss Weston's <reg orig="in-|valuable">invaluable</reg> <lb/>
"Monthly Letter" to Seamen, Marines, and <lb/>
Marine Artillery was started, and it proved from the <lb/>
outset an immense success. From a circulation of <lb/>
1500 copies per month in 1872, it rose to its present <lb/>
astounding figure of 21,000! And in addition, Miss <lb/>
Weston and her three Secretaries write to thousands <lb/>
of men individually.</p>
<p>The pleasure which these "Letters" give to lonely <lb/>
sailors all over the world, their significance to those <lb/>
ofttimes monotonous and isolated lives, and the <lb/>
spiritual blessing which in innumerable cases has <lb/>
followed their perusal, it is impossible to estimate.</p>
<pb n="65" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0076"/>
<p>The issue of a letter specially addressed to boys <lb/>
soon became necessary, for they too clamoured for <lb/>
a share in the treat. This was commenced in 1874, <lb/>
and the circulation soon reached many thousands <lb/>
per month.</p>
<p>Miss Weston's warm heart had not long been <lb/>
opened to receive Jack Tar, before she became deeply <lb/>
impressed with the fact that his worst foe is drink.</p>
<p>Having herself, ever since that memorable night <lb/>
at the Walcot Mission Room, been an out-and-out <lb/>
total abstainer, she was anxious to bring the power of <lb/>
her persuasions to bear upon the sailor.</p>
<p>This was by no means, at first, so easy as might be <lb/>
supposed, the discipline and rules of the Service being <lb/>
somewhat inflexible. But Admiral Sir W. King Hall, <lb/>
K.C.B., proved her earliest and most influential friend. <lb/>
He had heard her give a short address to the <lb/>
Devonport dockyard men in their dinner hour, and <lb/>
willingly recommended her to the captains of all the <lb/>
ships in the harbour. One after another of them she <lb/>
was thus permitted to visit, pledge-book in hand, and <lb/>
her earnest, affectionate words were not without effect <lb/>
upon the men.</p>
<p>A very amusing episode is related in connection <lb/>
with this phase of Miss Weston's work. We will <lb/>
describe it in her own graphic words:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I found myself one day on board H.M.S. <hi rend="italic">Topaze,</hi> <lb/>
of course by the kind permission of the commander. <lb/>
He was most interested in the proceedings, and was <lb/>
present himself; the crowd of blue-jackets were <lb/>
grouped before me on the lower deck. After <reg orig="address-|ing">addressing</reg> <lb/>
them, anxious not to lose an opportunity of taking <lb/>
the names of those who wished to enrol themselves on <lb/>
<pb n="66" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0077"/>
the <hi rend="italic">Topaze's</hi> books, I asked permission to do so, which <lb/>
was freely granted; but the difficulty still to be solved <lb/>
was the want of a table. I looked around, and seeing, <lb/>
as I supposed, a bread-tub with its bright polished <lb/>
bands standing near, I asked if I might be allowed to <lb/>
use it as a table.</p>
<p>"'Certainly,' was the answer, with a smile; 'but it's <lb/>
the first time it has been put to such a use. Now, <lb/>
men, a couple of hands to roll out the <hi rend="italic">grog-tub!</hi>'</p>
<p>"Amid cheers and laughter the grog-tub was rolled <lb/>
out, and a capital table it made, on which more than <lb/>
sixty enrolled their names. One young sailor came <lb/>
forward and signed his name; after doing so he laid <lb/>
down the pen, and, significantly rapping the tub with <lb/>
his knuckles, said, 'There goes a nail in your coffin, <lb/>
old fellow!'</p>
<p>"After all that wished to do so had entered their <lb/>
names, the commander took up the book, and running <lb/>
his eye down the lists, significantly added, 'Sixty odd <lb/>
nails to-day; if they all hold firm I won't give much <lb/>
for the old grog-tub's life.'"</p>
<p>Years have passed by since that first nail was <lb/>
driven home, and if the grog-tub has not yet been <lb/>
tossed overboard altogether, its power over the fine <lb/>
fellows in our Navy has lessened to an astonishing <lb/>
degree. Every ship in the Service has now a branch <lb/>
of the <hi rend="italic">Royal Naval Temperance Society</hi> in full swing <lb/>
on board. During a recent year 6021 pledges were <lb/>
taken at Devonport and Portsmouth alone.</p>
<p>As an encouragement to faithfulness, medals are <lb/>
offered to those who keep the pledge unbroken for five <lb/>
years, with "bars" for ten, fifteen and twenty years <lb/>
abstinence. Stars of merit are also given to the <reg orig="Com-|mittee">Committee</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="67" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0078"/>
of any ship showing ten per cent. of the ship's <lb/>
company on the books of the society for three months. <lb/>
Upwards of 1500 of these medals and stars have <lb/>
already been won.</p>
<p>Voluntary tributes to the vastly improved character <lb/>
of our blue-jackets are often given by officers and <lb/>
others who are in a position to compare the present <lb/>
with the past.</p>
<p>A gentleman who chanced to be in Lisbon during <lb/>
a recent visit of H.M.S. <hi rend="italic">Australia</hi>, and whose duties <lb/>
as a civilian have afforded him opportunities of <reg orig="wit-|nessing">witnessing</reg> <lb/>
the behaviour for twenty years past of British <lb/>
crews in many parts of the world, has testified that, <lb/>
"I must say I never saw a crew behave as well as the <lb/>
men of the <hi rend="italic">Australia</hi>. They were perfect gentlemen, <lb/>
and were a credit to their officers and their country."</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>' correspondent at Lisbon also wrote of <lb/>
the "quiet, dignified behaviour" of the men while on <lb/>
shore as exciting "universal admiration."</p>
<p>No wonder that Miss Weston and her zealous <lb/>
helpers feel their hearts glow with gratitude to God <lb/>
and pride in their men, as they read such eulogies as <lb/>
these! It is abundantly evident that their work has <lb/>
not been in vain.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">In</hi> the pleasant town of Devonport, exactly opposite <lb/>
the gates of the Royal Dockyard, stands a <reg orig="hand-|some">handsome</reg> <lb/>
pile of buildings, known as the Royal Sailors' <lb/>
<pb n="68" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0079"/>
Rest. It occupies the site formerly filled by three <lb/>
public-houses.</p>
<p>The exterior of this Jack Tar's hotel is most <reg orig="entic-|ing">enticing</reg>; <lb/>
plenty of glittering mirrors, gas and gilding, <lb/>
while the white and gold china barrels with silver taps <lb/>
bearing the inscriptions, "New Milk," "Lemonade," <lb/>
"Ginger-Beer," etc., vie with the shining coffee urns <lb/>
in aspiring to quench the thirst of Jack when <lb/>
ashore.</p>
<p>Plenty of good food, hot, sweet, and above all in big <lb/>
platefuls, is also to be had at a reasonable price, while <lb/>
a large smoking-room adjoins.</p>
<p>Upstairs is a comfortably furnished reading and <lb/>
writing-room; cosy bedrooms for officers, and <reg orig="charm-|ing">charming</reg> <lb/>
wee cabins for the men, each furnished with a <lb/>
spotless bed, clean and comfortable&mdash;a great luxury <lb/>
to a man, after perhaps, days and nights spent in wind <lb/>
and wet&mdash;a chair, a strip of carpet, and some bright <lb/>
pictures and texts. These private cabins are much <lb/>
prized, especially by the Christian men, as they have <lb/>
no quiet place which they can call their own on board <lb/>
ship.</p>
<p>At right angles with the Institute, and in the <lb/>
rear, is the Hall, where meetings are held every day, <lb/>
for amusement and recreation during the week, and <lb/>
for the preaching and singing of the Gospel on <lb/>
Sundays.</p>
<p>In Commercial Road, Portsmouth, another of these <lb/>
magnificent Blue Jackets' Coffee Palaces supplies <lb/>
good food and drink by day, and comfortable beds by <lb/>
night to hundreds of men and boys.</p>
<p>And don't they appreciate it all!</p>
<p>"Your Sailors' Rest," said the captain of a <reg orig="training-|ship">training-ship</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="69" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0080"/>
to Miss Weston one day, "is like a magnet. No <lb/>
matter where the boys land they make for it."</p>
<p>One boy said to a chum, "I wish, Jack, that you'd <lb/>
come to the Boys' Bible-Class at the Sailors' Rest; <lb/>
I'm sure you'll like it. I'll stand you a fid of plum <lb/>
duff if you'll come."</p>
<p>The "fid"&mdash;<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> piece, of plum-pudding prevailed. <lb/>
The boy went, and stayed, and went again. In after <lb/>
years he said, "How can I thank my chum enough? <lb/>
For that piece of duff led me to a place where I <lb/>
learned that Christ loved me, and now I love Him."</p>
<p>But before we relate any more good results of these <lb/>
Sailors' Rests, we must pause to tell how they first <lb/>
came about.</p>
<p>It began with the boys from the training-ships <lb/>
stationed at Devonport. Miss Weston, while staying <lb/>
with a friend in the neighbourhood, became interested <lb/>
in the immense number of sailor lads who might be <lb/>
seen wandering aimlessly about the streets on Sunday <lb/>
afternoons, forming bad habits and mixing with <lb/>
dangerous company.</p>
<p>Although by no means encouraged by the officers <lb/>
whom she consulted on the subject, and who thought <lb/>
that the natural restlessness of the sailor boys on <lb/>
shore would prevent success in any attempt to gather <lb/>
them together, Miss Weston had notices distributed <lb/>
among the lads on board ship, inviting them to meet <lb/>
her at a large public room in Devonport, for singing <lb/>
and reading on Sunday afternoons.</p>
<p>On the first Sunday, <hi rend="italic">one</hi> boy appeared, out of the <lb/>
hundreds who were roaming the streets, and he was <lb/>
too much frightened at his solitary position to be <reg orig="in-|duced">induced</reg> <lb/>
to stay.</p>
<pb n="70" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0081"/>
<p>Four Sundays more passed as discouragingly by, <lb/>
and then even Miss Weston felt inclined to give up. <lb/>
But first she asked help and wisdom of the Lord in <lb/>
prayer.</p>
<p>One of the officers alluded to, had compared the <lb/>
boys to "birds let out of a cage;"&mdash;as shy did they <lb/>
seem, as difficult to catch and hold. But like birds <lb/>
they were to be tempted and tamed with crumbs.</p>
<p>The crumb in this case was the offer of tea and <lb/>
cake in the roomy kitchen belonging to Miss <lb/>
Weston's friend, Mrs. Wintz, and two earnest Christian <lb/>
men volunteered to go out into the streets and try to <lb/>
gather the boys in.</p>
<p>This time the effort was more successful; a dozen <lb/>
lads were collected, regaled with a substantial meal, <lb/>
and entertained by the singing of sacred songs and <lb/>
the telling of some simple Bible story.</p>
<p>These soon brought a dozen more, and in a very <lb/>
few weeks the ever-increasing numbers were filling <lb/>
Mrs. Wintz's cheery kitchen to overflowing. They <lb/>
would sit we are told, "on the window-ledge, among <lb/>
the cups and saucers on the dresser, and even inside <lb/>
the grate"!</p>
<p>Some of those lads, Miss Weston was rejoiced to <lb/>
find, were already Christians, leading bright, <reg orig="con-|sistent">consistent</reg> <lb/>
lives among their mates, and these were her <lb/>
staunch allies in bringing others to the meetings.</p>
<p>By-and-by, when the kitchen could no longer <lb/>
possibly contain all who came, a large room was <lb/>
hired, close to one of the landing-places, and this in <lb/>
its turn was filled with boys every Sunday <reg orig="after-|noon">afternoon</reg>.</p>
<p>Then some began to ask if they could not have a <lb/>

place to come to on week-days as well,&mdash;"a <reg orig="public-|house">public-house</reg> <lb/>

<p>Many difficulties were again to be surmounted <lb/>
before this desire could be attained; but with the help <lb/>
from above given in answer to many earnest prayers, <lb/>
they one by one gave way.</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1874 a big house became vacant <lb/>
in Fore Street, the main thoroughfare of Devonport. <lb/>
It was exactly the sort of place Miss Weston wanted, <lb/>
roomy and substantial, but needing many alterations <lb/>
before it would be ready for her purpose.</p>
<p>With the help of her ever faithful friend and <reg orig="fellow-|labourer">fellow-labourer</reg>, <lb/>
Miss Wintz, Miss Weston at once <reg orig="com-|menced">commenced</reg> <lb/>
collecting money for the work, and with <lb/>
marked success. A letter to the <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> resulted <lb/>
in a few days in sufficient to pay the whole of the first <lb/>
year's rent; friends of the sailor from all parts of the <lb/>
world willingly helped, and Jack himself was only too <lb/>
pleased to send his savings to swell the purse; until <lb/>
the &pound;6000 was collected which bought and fitted up <lb/>
the Devonport Sailors' Rest.</p>
<p>The work of alteration and improvement necessarily <lb/>
occupied some time, and it was not until the 8th of <lb/>
May, 1876, that, at five o'clock on a sunny morning, the <lb/>
doors were actually opened for business, and customers <lb/>
at once began to pour in. But from that hour to the <lb/>
present the popularity and usefulness of the place has <lb/>
never flagged.</p>
<p>Connected with the Institute, as we have said, is a <lb/>
hall, where Gospel services are held, and every kind <lb/>
of effort made for the good of Jack's soul as earnestly <lb/>
as in the adjoining building the comfort and welfare <lb/>
of his body are considered.</p>
<pb n="74" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0085"/>
<p>The following incident, culled, as are many others <lb/>
in this sketch, from Miss Wintz's interesting book, <lb/>
"Our Blue-Jackets," is well worth quoting as a <lb/>
specimen of the sort of influence which the Sailors' <lb/>
Rest exercises over the tar.</p>
<p>A sailor, half-sober, sauntered one evening into <lb/>
the bright bar. Throwing down half-a-crown on the <lb/>
counter, he called out to one of the servers to give <lb/>
him a glass of half-and-half, "and mind you make it <lb/>
stiff," he added. Instead of looking grimly at him <lb/>
and reproving him, she at once said, with a woman's <lb/>
tact&mdash;</p>
<p>"We haven't your sort of half-and-half, but would <lb/>
you like to try some of ours?"</p>
<p>"Yours!" was his response. "What's that, then?"</p>
<p>"Well," she said, "will you have something hot or <lb/>
cold?"</p>
<p>He smiled. "You seem to have more than cold <lb/>
water; I'd like a jorum of something hot."</p>
<p>"Well, would you like a cup of coffee?"</p>
<p>"Yes, that I would," he answered; "it's a long <lb/>
time since I've had much in the coffee line."</p>
<p>Looking at him again, and thinking that she would <lb/>
bait the hook still more, she said, "Are you a <reg orig="Devon-|shire">Devonshire</reg> <lb/>
man?"</p>
<p>"To be sure I am&mdash;a West countryman to the <lb/>
backbone," was the prompt answer.</p>
<p>"Then," she said, "you'll like a little Devonshire <lb/>
cream in your coffee."</p>
<p>This carried the day; Jack's eyes fairly danced in <lb/>
his head, as he said, "I've been round the Horn, and <lb/>
I don't know where beside, but it's a long day since <lb/>
I and Devonshire cream have met. Thank ye, <lb/>

missus, kindly," and he sat down to enjoy the first <lb/>
cup of coffee he had tested for many a day.</p>
<p>The story goes on to relate that when only a penny <lb/>
was charged him for the treat, his amazement knew <lb/>
no bounds, and he went away to tell his mates about <lb/>
the new-fangled public-house which he had found. <lb/>
Better still, it was the beginning of a new life to <lb/>
him. He became a Temperance man and a zealous <lb/>
Christian.</p>
<p>"And all along," as he said, "under God, of that <lb/>
kind word and cup of coffee."</p>
<p>Jack is certainly most appreciative of good things <lb/>
of every sort. From Saturday to Monday, at <reg orig="Devon-|port">Devonport</reg> <lb/>
alone, he consumed: one whole pig, to say <lb/>
nothing of beef and mutton, 1200 eggs, 150 dozen <lb/>
rolls, 1100 sausages, 9 hams, and 30 gallons of tea <lb/>
and coffee, while over &pound;100 was taken across the <lb/>
counter in small sums.</p>
<p>And at the Rest in Commercial Road, Portsmouth, <lb/>
opened in June, 1882, precisely the same sort of <lb/>
thing is continually going on.</p>
<p>Drunk or sober, Jack is always welcome. When <lb/>
the beds are all full, "shake-downs" are hastily <lb/>
prepared; when these are every one occupied, the <lb/>
lounges of the reading and recreation rooms, the <lb/>
reading-room table, which is declared "ample <reg orig="ac-|commodation">accommodation</reg> <lb/>
for nine," and all the smaller tables <lb/>
are pressed into the service. Far into the small hours <lb/>
of the morning the police keep bringing in poor, <lb/>
helpless fellows, too much the worse for drink to be <lb/>
able to take care of themselves. When the <reg orig="public-|house">public-house</reg> <lb/>
turns them out, the Rest takes them in, and not <lb/>
unfrequently their gratitude is so great that they <lb/>
<pb n="78" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0089"/>
are willing to abjure the public-house for ever <lb/>
more.</p>
<p>It is between 11 and 11.30 P.M. when ships are in <lb/>
<figure id="f16" rend="block" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0089">
<head>THE REFRESHMENT BAR.</head>

port that the most business is done. Were we to <lb/>
look in at either of the Sailors' Rests about that time, <lb/>
we should see, "Here a man turning out his pockets, <lb/>
<pb n="79" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0090"/>
and giving his loose cash, watch, etc., to the manager, <lb/>
to keep till morning, receiving a receipt in return; <lb/>
there, a party just come in are discussing coffee and <lb/>
pasties, a noisy seaman is being coaxed and persuaded <lb/>
to go to bed, while a lively set of young fellows call <lb/>
out, 'Last boats just off! Good-night all!' as they <lb/>
disappear to their rooms."</p>
<p>A nickname in the Navy generally means popularity. <lb/>
None could be more apt than that bestowed on the <lb/>
Rest by the sailors themselves. They call it the <lb/>
"Three C.'s." As one of them explained, "It means <lb/>
Coffee, Comfort and Company; and if a man's got <lb/>
good coffee, comfort, and plenty of good company. <lb/>
it goes a long way to keep him from what's wrong."</p>
<p>Bright evangelistic meetings, lasting not more than <lb/>
one hour, are constantly arranged for in connection <lb/>
with all the social efforts, and bright temperance <lb/>
entertainments are supplied to tempt Jack out of <lb/>
harm's way.</p>
<p>Many are the touching testimonies received of the <lb/>
blessing gained at these religious gatherings; sailors <lb/>
write from all parts of the world telling that a <lb/>
sentence in some Gospel address, or the words of <lb/>
some beautiful hymn sung by the choir have been <lb/>
the means of leading them to Christ.</p>
<p>Warm expressions of approval have been from time <lb/>
to time vouchsafed to Miss Weston by Royalty.</p>
<p>H.R.H. the Prince of Wales as well as both the <lb/>
Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh have visited the <lb/>
Sailors' Rest at Devonport. The Prince of Wales <lb/>
expressed himself delighted with all that he saw, and <lb/>
specially admired the cabins.</p>
<p>In the course of a few years, as a natural result of <lb/>
<pb n="80" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0091"/>
success, more space became the imperative demand. <lb/>
At first, so fully occupied was every foot of land in <lb/>
the neighbourhood, that larger premises seemed <reg orig="im-|possible">impossible</reg>, <lb/>
but before long, again as the reward of <lb/>
prayer and perseverance, three of the worst <reg orig="public-|houses">public-houses</reg> <lb/>
in Devonport, standing in a row close to the <lb/>
Dock gates, and depreciated in value, doubtless, by <lb/>
their flourishing Temperance rival, were bought, <lb/>
licences and all, for &pound;7000, and the present handsome <lb/>
Royal Sailors' Rest erected on their site.</p>
<p>During Jubilee year an interesting visit was paid <lb/>
to the Portsmouth Rest by H.R.H. the Crown <lb/>
Princess of Germany, now the Empress Frederick. <lb/>
H.R.H. accompanied by Princess Victoria of Prussia <lb/>
and others of her suite, went all over the building; <lb/>
she chatted to the blue-jackets in the reading-room, <lb/>
and delighted them by drinking a cup of coffee, which <lb/>
she pronounced excellent.</p>
<p>"After thoroughly inspecting the building, H.R.H. <lb/>
expressed to Miss Weston her great pleasure in all <lb/>
that she had seen, and said that she wished to endow <lb/>
a cabin because her second son was a sailor. This <lb/>
cabin can be seen at Portsmouth, a portrait of Prince <lb/>
Henry of Prussia, kindly sent by the Emperor from <lb/>
Kiel, hanging in it."</p>
<p>Captain H.R.H. the Duke of York has also most <lb/>
generously presented a cabin and consented to become <lb/>
president of the institution.</p>

<p>Though not exposed to so many perils of the deep <lb/>
as our fishing-fleets and smaller merchantmen, Her <lb/>

in the Corea, and the whaler of H.M.S. <hi rend="italic">Acorn</hi> on <lb/>

<pb n="82" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0093"/>
<p>Sympathetic hearts all over England are moved <lb/>
with sorrow when such news arrives, and many will <lb/>
ache for the poor widows and children of the drowned <lb/>
men. But it is to Miss Weston and her helpers that <lb/>
the grief comes most keenly home; none can realise <lb/>
it as they do.</p>
<p>The wives and mothers who so smilingly crowded <lb/>
the bar of the Sailors' Rest when Jack was last at <lb/>
home, or sat, with baby on knee, at one or other of the <lb/>
pleasant social gatherings to which they are welcome, <lb/>
now rush broken-hearted to the Admiral's office to <lb/>
learn more of the dreadful truth.</p>
<p>At the best of times, they live within measurable <lb/>
distance of destitution. Few sailors are able to send <lb/>
their wives more than ten shillings a-week, and when <lb/>
this is suddenly cut off, starvation stares the poor <lb/>
widow and little ones in the face.</p>
<p>Miss Weston and Miss Wintz have long been sorely <lb/>
exercised in mind as to how best to help Jack's wife. <lb/>
Sailors' Wives' Meetings, Drapery Clubs, etc., have <lb/>
been started for her benefit; and a Work Department <lb/>
has been organised in connection with the Royal <lb/>
Sailors' Rest at Portsmouth, where a skilled cutter-out <lb/>
prepares work for nimble and industrious fingers, and <lb/>
whence issue numbers of beautifully made garments&mdash; <lb/>
ladies' and children's underclothing, and little one's <lb/>
dresses&mdash;for purchase by any who wish to help forward <lb/>
the good work.</p>
<p>But although the sailor's wife can in this way eke <lb/>
out her weekly pay, it is hard for her, when she is <lb/>
bereft of her husband, to wholly support, by her <lb/>
needle, herself and children.</p>
<p>Grand as have been the sums of money collected by <lb/>
<pb n="83" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0094"/>
the public on the occasion of each of the great naval <lb/>
disasters we have mentioned, and untold the relief and <lb/>
comfort administered by such means to the bereaved, <lb/>
it could not be enough. Miss Weston has long felt <lb/>
that something permanent ought to be arranged by <lb/>
Government for the assistance of the widows and <lb/>
orphans of the brave men who lose their lives in their <lb/>
country's service.</p>
<p>Several funds for this purpose already existed, but <lb/>
their administration appears to have been somewhat <lb/>
defective; for, as examples, Miss Weston was able, <lb/>
when the subject was under Government consideration, <lb/>
to bring to the House of Commons nine aged women, <lb/>
all widows or mothers of soldiers or sailors, and all in <lb/>
the direst need.</p>
<p>Subp&oelig;naed to give evidence before a Select <reg orig="Com-|mittee">Committee</reg> <lb/>
of the House of Commons, she was exhaustively <lb/>
cross-examined on this subject, of which no one was <lb/>
in a better position than she to furnish accurate and <lb/>
sympathetic information. And it is satisfactory to <lb/>
learn that the chief points concerning the amelioration <lb/>
of the existing state of things which Miss Weston <lb/>
specially urged, were all conceded by the Select <reg orig="Com-|mittee">Committee</reg>, <lb/>
and will, doubtless, ere long be brought into <lb/>
operation.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the bereaved wives and mothers, and in <lb/>
some cases the sisters also of the men drowned in the <lb/>
later disasters have all received pecuniary help, gifts <lb/>
of mourning and kindly letters from Miss Weston <lb/>
herself.</p>
<p>The great thing now desired is the establishment of <lb/>
a "Widows' Pension Fund," which shall ensure to each <lb/>
widow &pound;20 a-year, and the men are ready to <reg orig="contri-|bute">contribute</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="84" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0095"/>
all they can from their small pay to start it. <lb/>
Another desideratum is a National Insurance Fund, <lb/>
in which blue-jackets and marines shall be able to <lb/>
insure their lives, so that how ever and wherever they <lb/>
may die, whether on active duty, or in some sudden <lb/>
ocean calamity, or by the slow ravages of disease, the <lb/>
wife and children, or dependent mother, may be <lb/>
certainly provided for.</p>
<p>But while those excellent schemes are being thought <lb/>
out and arranged for, Miss Weston and her helpers <lb/>
are patiently working on, doing everything in their <lb/>
power for Jack and all who are dear to him. Year <lb/>
after year sees enlargement, improvement, extension <lb/>
of benefits and fresh endeavours to supply every need.</p>
<p>It may interest some readers to learn that the sum <lb/>
of &pound;31, 10s. will build and furnish a cabin; &pound;21, 10s. <lb/>
a Bath Cubicle, &pound;5 a bed, and &pound;2 a locker, at the <lb/>
Royal Sailors' Rest at Devonport or Portsmouth, and <lb/>
the donor of either a cabin or a cubicle may have a <lb/>
brass put up on the door commemorating the gift with <lb/>
any inscription desired. But smaller gifts, down to <lb/>
the very smallest, are thankfully received and urgently <lb/>
required.</p>
<p>This brief sketch purports to have for its subject the <lb/>
life of Agnes Weston, but the lady herself seems to be <lb/>
well-nigh hidden by her great work. After all, how <lb/>
could we better describe what she is, than by telling <lb/>
what she has done? And her reward, as much of it <lb/>
at least as she can receive in this life, is the gratitude <lb/>
and love of countless noble, simple, manly hearts all <lb/>
the world over.</p>
<p>"Come along, Jack!" joyfully shouts a blue-jacket <lb/>
to his chummy, when the boatswain's mate gives out <lb/>
<pb n="85" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0096"/>
that Miss Weston has arrived on deck to give a little <lb/>
address to the men; "Come along! Here's yer naval <lb/>
mother come aboard, and wants to have a yarn with <lb/>
you!"</p>
<p>Then their bright, bronzed faces crowd round her <lb/>
in scores, ready and willing to hear and attend to <lb/>
what she has to say,&mdash;always words to do them good <lb/>
body and soul, having the promise of the life which <lb/>
now is, and that which is to come.</p>
<p>"Three sheets in the wind, mother!" sang a big <lb/>
tar, as he lurched into the Rest one night, very much <lb/>
the worse for drink. "I'm sorry that you should see <lb/>
it; but it is a long lane that has no turning, and you'll <lb/>
see me a better boy yet!"</p>
<p>And so, most likely, she will; Jack warmly <reg orig="appreci-|ates">appreciates</reg> <lb/>
patience and kindliness, and the affectionate <lb/>
interest of gentle Christian ladies. Quarrelsome as <lb/>
he is when tipsy, Miss Weston and her friends are <lb/>
always able to stop a fight; the men's fists instantly <lb/>
drop when one of them goes between the combatants. <lb/>
But the temperance work progresses grandly, and now, <lb/>
when a ship is paid off after a long voyage, instead of <lb/>
the dreadful scenes of drunkenness and violence which <lb/>
used to disgrace the streets, the men, quiet and orderly, <lb/>
go home with their money to their wives, or join their <lb/>
companions in the harmless festivities of the Sailors' <lb/>
Rest. Very often not one man of a whole ship's <reg orig="com-|pany">company</reg> <lb/>
will be seen the worse for drink.</p>
<p>Miss Weston's blue-jacket friends have been much <lb/>
distressed by her recent serious accident when <reg orig="bi-|cycling">bicycling</reg>. <lb/>
"Whatever did you get aboard such a <lb/>
risky craft as that for?" said one of them. "A <reg orig="steam-|launch">steam-launch</reg>, <lb/>
now" &lpar;which we suppose is nautical for a <lb/>
<pb n="86" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0097"/>
railway-train!&rpar; "would ha' been safe enough." And <lb/>
to set their anxieties at rest, she has promised to give <lb/>
up the wheel.</p>
<p>No, the sailors would find it hard to lose their <lb/>
"naval mother," and we trust it may be many long <lb/>
years before they are called upon to do so.</p>
<p>Even now, with all we have said, space has failed <lb/>
us to tell as we would have wished of the monthly <lb/>
magazine, <hi rend="italic">Ashore and Afloat</hi>, a bright pennyworth <lb/>
which circulates by hundreds of thousands among our <lb/>
own naval and merchant seamen and fishermen, and <lb/>
is warmly welcomed by the United States' sailors as <lb/>
well; of the Employment Bureau for needy wives and <lb/>
widows; the Ambulance Classes, where Jack learns <lb/>
how to supply First Aid to a wounded comrade, and <lb/>
stem the flowing tide of life until doctor or hospital <lb/>
can be reached; and the newly organised Royal <lb/>
Sailors' Rest Volunteer Brigade, consisting of <reg orig="com-|panies">companies</reg> <lb/>
of children of the middle and upper classes who <lb/>
are willing to collect money for the work and send <lb/>
clothing or toys for Jack's little ones.</p>
<p>We must conclude, and we can scarcely do so <lb/>
more fittingly than by echoing the simple, heartfelt <lb/>
phrase uttered at a prayer-meeting on board H.M.S. <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Dryad</hi> the other day, when one of the blue-jackets <lb/>
after another said "God bless Miss Weston," and <lb/>
may she long be spared in health and activity to <lb/>
carry on her noble work "for the good of the Service <lb/>
and the glory of God."</p>

"LITTLE SUNSHINE."</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">In</hi> the Yorkshire village of Hauxwell, near <reg orig="Rich-|mond">Richmond</reg>, <lb/>
there lived, half-a-century ago, a good <lb/>
clergyman and his wife, named Pattison, and <lb/>
their large family of twelve children. The eldest and <lb/>
youngest of these were sons, and all the rest daughters.</p>
<p>The youngest of the ten girls was little Dorothy, <lb/>
or Dora, as she was commonly called, a winsome <lb/>
creature, gifted with extreme beauty, a merry spirit, <lb/>
and sweetness of temper, that made her the pet and <lb/>
darling of her older sisters; whose tenderness and <lb/>
care were frequently called into requisition by the <lb/>
attacks of illness to which Dora was subject during <lb/>
the whole of her childish days.</p>
<p>The Pattison family were noted for kindness and <lb/>
benevolence to their poorer neighbours. Although <lb/>
rich enough to have bestowed charity with ordinary <lb/>
freedom whenever it was needed, we are told that <lb/>
<pb n="90" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0101"/>
"the girls were always planning how to save their <lb/>
money to give it away, and they made a rule of <lb/>
carefully mending and re-making their old clothes, <lb/>
in order that they might not have to buy new ones." <lb/>
Also, they thought nothing of giving away their <lb/>
dinners and faring on bread-and-cheese themselves. <lb/>
"In fact," to quote again from Dora's biographer, <lb/>
"giving to others instead of spending on themselves, <lb/>
seems to have been the rule and delight of their lives; <lb/>
for not only did they liberally bestow money, but <lb/>
time, instruction, powers of mind and body, and above <lb/>
all, love and pity to those around them."</p>
<p>In such an atmosphere as this, was reared the fine <lb/>
nature of the little girl who was by-and-by to be <lb/>
enshrined in the hearts of thousands of her poor and <lb/>
suffering fellow-creatures as "Sister Dora."</p>
<p>Like all who leave an impress upon the world, <lb/>
Dorothy Pattison was possessed of a very decided <lb/>
"will of her own." She loved to have her own way; <lb/>
not so much because it was <hi rend="italic">her</hi> way, still less because <lb/>
it was in opposition to other people's way, but because <lb/>
she felt so strongly convinced that it was the best <lb/>
way. And we are bound to admit, so quick was her <lb/>
insight, and so true her judgment that, in after years, <lb/>
at least, she was generally right.</p>
<p>Not always, of course, and certainly not in her <lb/>
early days; as may be shown by a rather amusing <lb/>
anecdote, which also well illustrates the young lady's <lb/>
readiness of resource and that ingenuity in <reg orig="com-|passing">compassing</reg> <lb/>
the desired end which made her so effectual <lb/>
a power for good when her manifold gifts were <reg orig="con-|secrated">consecrated</reg> <lb/>
to the service of God.</p>
<p>Dora and the sister next in age to her, who was <lb/>
<pb n="91" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0102"/>
her dearly-loved and constant companion, were <reg orig="pro-|vided">provided</reg> <lb/>
one winter with velvet bonnets which by no <lb/>
means pleased their juvenile taste. Objections proved <lb/>
of no avail, the bonnets were bought, and they must <lb/>
be worn, unless&mdash;ah, here was the loop-hole of escape! <lb/>
&mdash;unless something happened to damage them.</p>
<p>One day, it poured with rain; mother had gone <lb/>
for a long drive, nurse and sisters were all conveniently <lb/>
out of the way; Dora, brimming over with her <lb/>
brilliant idea, ran to her sister. "Be quick; now's <lb/>
our chance of spoiling our bonnets!"</p>
<p>On went the luckless bonnets, out at a window <lb/>
poked two naughty little heads, until the hated velvet <lb/>
was well soaked in the downpour of wet. Then, at <lb/>
the suggestion of far-sighted Dora, who did not wish a <lb/>
satisfactory hour's work to be undone by any remedial <lb/>
measure, they were taken off and stowed quietly away <lb/>
in their respective boxes all dripping as they were.</p>
<p>Sunday morning came, and the deplorable state of <lb/>
the velvet bonnets was then calmly announced by the <lb/>
chief culprit. "They are quite spoilt; we can never <lb/>
wear them any more."</p>
<p>But alas! the "best-laid schemes of mice" and <lb/>
naughty little girls, sometimes end in humiliating <lb/>
failure. The bonnets were worn that Sunday and for <lb/>
many Sundays after, so the plotters only succeeded in <lb/>
getting themselves "out of the frying-pan into the fire."</p>
<p>More creditable as well as more successful was the <lb/>
next instance we have on record of Dora's wilfulness. <lb/>
When she was about twelve years old, the sister <lb/>
mentioned above had a serious illness, and Dora, who <lb/>
had always been very fond of tending, washing and <lb/>
nursing her imaginary sick dollies, now begged and <lb/>
<pb n="92" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0103"/>
entreated to be allowed to sit up with the dear <lb/>
patient. This was at first firmly refused, but one <lb/>
night the devoted little sister smuggled herself into <lb/>
the room unobserved; when by-and-by discovered, she <lb/>
was rewarded for her persistence by being allowed to <lb/>
remain, and she helped to nurse her sister until the <lb/>
latter was well again.</p>
<p>A year or two later, Dora's overflowing helpfulness <lb/>
and disposition to carry out impulsively her own <lb/>
desires, both got her into disgrace at home, and gave <lb/>
her a singularly true foretaste of what she would have <lb/>
to go through in after life.</p>
<p>Fever was rife in the village of Hauxwell, and Dora, <lb/>
calling one day to inquire after an old woman who <lb/>
was ill, found her very bad and with no one to do <lb/>
anything for her. Immediately Dora, with no thought <lb/>
of permission from home to be asked or received, <lb/>
hung up her hat and cloak behind the door and <lb/>
resolved to stay. She washed, tended, and read to <lb/>
the poor woman, and when evening came she sent <lb/>
word to her parents of where she was and her <reg orig="in-|tention">intention</reg> <lb/>
to remain. Somewhat to her dismay the <lb/>
answer was returned, "You went without our <reg orig="permis-|sion">permission</reg>; <lb/>
now stay where you are until you are sent for."</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the careful ministrations of the <lb/>
devoted young nurse, her patient grew worse, and the <lb/>
next night she died. A neighbour then came in and <lb/>
helped, but by-and-by she was forced to go home, <lb/>
and Dora was left alone with the body. It is <reg orig="charac-|teristic">characteristic</reg> <lb/>
of the girl's pride and courage that she did not <lb/>
run away, but waiting quietly until the morning, sent <lb/>
the message to the rectory that the woman was dead, <lb/>
and "Please, may I come home?"</p>
<pb n="93" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0104"/>
<p>But once more came the answer, "Stay where you <lb/>
are until you are sent for."</p>
<p>This was, however, shortly followed by the <reg orig="appear-|ance">appearance</reg> <lb/>
of the family carriage, and in it the old nurse, <lb/>
looking very stern and displeased. The sentence was <lb/>
that Dora was to be banished to the sea-side, both as <lb/>
a punishment and as a precaution against spreading <lb/>
infection, before being allowed to mix with her relations.</p>
<p>At hearing this, the irrepressible girl began to <lb/>
dance for joy, to the great scandalisation of nurse, <lb/>
who reminded her that she was in dire disgrace. She <lb/>
enjoyed a pleasant time, however, at the sea-side, <lb/>
notwithstanding nurse's grave refusal to allow her to <lb/>
invite to tea any of the children whose acquaintance <lb/>
she made upon the sands. And on returning home, <lb/>
in some trepidation, she was astonished to find herself <lb/>
received with kisses and caresses, and praises for her <lb/>
courage, until, as she said, "I was quite inflated, and <lb/>
did not know what to make of it all."</p>
<p>Dora did not like study. She was excused, on <lb/>
account of her frequent illnesses, from doing regular <lb/>
lessons while she was little; and when feeling well <lb/>
enough, she delighted in all sorts of out-of-door <lb/>
sports, rioting about "just as wild, merry, and noisy <lb/>
as a boy." Even as a child she possessed wonderful <lb/>
patience and fortitude under suffering, her naturally <lb/>
sweet temper and brave spirit being rarely disturbed <lb/>
by her ill-health, while her love of fun and immense <lb/>
capacity for seeing the humorous side of everything&mdash; <lb/>
a gift which brightened her life until its latest day&mdash; <lb/>
bubbled over continually. Her father gave her the <lb/>
pet name of "Sunshine," and surely no more radiant <lb/>
creature ever "made sunshine in the shady places" of <lb/>
<pb n="94" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0105"/>
this dull old earth than did Sister Dora in the dark <lb/>
spots where she chose to spend her life.</p>
<p>It has been thought by some that our heroine did <lb/>
not, in her earliest days, show many signs of that <lb/>
wonderful aptitude for tending the sick which <reg orig="after-|wards">afterwards</reg> <lb/>
made her famous; but in addition to the <reg orig="illus-|trations">illustrations</reg> <lb/>
we have already given of her passionate love of <lb/>
helping those in need, she herself told a friend that as a <lb/>
child she used to say, "When I grow up, I'll be a nurse, <lb/>
or a lady doctor, and do everything for my patients."</p>
<p>With this end in view, the little girl argued that it <lb/>
was no use for her to learn music and languages; she <lb/>
"didn't want to be a fine drawing-room lady." But <lb/>
her teachers showed her that a nice Christian nurse <lb/>
should learn everything she had time to learn. "How <lb/>
could she be certain she would never have French or <lb/>
German patients? and all like music."</p>
<p>This way of looking at the matter made Dora very <lb/>
much more content. "And, dears," she would say to <lb/>
her young friends in after life, "there isn't a single <lb/>
thing, nor an accomplishment, that has not in some <lb/>
way been hallowed in this service for God. So never <lb/>
you feel that it is waste of time to get knowledge of <hi rend="italic">any <lb/>
kind;</hi> you can never tell how handy it may come in."</p>
<p>As Dora grew older and stronger, drawing in daily <lb/>
the health-giving air of the open moors which <reg orig="sur-|rounded">surrounded</reg> <lb/>
her home, she took great delight in all athletic <lb/>
sports&mdash;shooting, rowing, swimming, archery, skating, <lb/>
and even climbing trees, while, like all strong natures <lb/>
with an aptitude to rule, she loved to control a horse, <lb/>
and riding and driving were among her greatest joys. <lb/>
That she was a good and daring horsewoman it is <lb/>
unnecessary to say.</p>
<pb n="95" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0106"/>
<p>All these pursuits tended towards physical <reg orig="develop-|ment">development</reg> <lb/>
and strength. After a severe illness, when about <lb/>
fourteen years of age, Dora's health took a decided <lb/>
turn for the better, and during the next few years she <lb/>
bloomed out into a fine and robust young woman. <lb/>
At twenty years old she is described as "tall, strong, <lb/>
and healthy, &hellip; vigorous both at work and play, <lb/>
and with a restless energy which would not be satisfied <lb/>
with inaction of body or mind for one single moment." <lb/>
She, moreover, possessed regular features, brilliant <lb/>
dark-brown eyes, wavy dark hair, a beautiful <reg orig="com-|plexion">complexion</reg>, <lb/>
and great vivacity of expression. If we add <lb/>
to this an elegant figure, with the queenly height of <lb/>
five feet seven inches, a clear, rich voice, and last, <lb/>
but by no means least, mental powers that were far <lb/>
beyond the average, we may form some idea of the <lb/>
personal attractions which lent their aid to securing <lb/>
for Sister Dora the love and admiration which her <lb/>
noble character and unselfish disposition so abundantly <lb/>
merited.</p>

<p>Mr. Pattison, however, did not sympathise with his <lb/>
daughter's aspirations; we venture to think he did <lb/>
not understand her character, nor the urgings of rare <lb/>
though perhaps unconscious capability that were <reg orig="im-|pelling">impelling</reg> <lb/>
Dora to seek a wider sphere for her energies <lb/>
than quiet home-life in a tiny village could possibly <lb/>
afford.</p>
<p>He pointed out to her the indisputable fact that <lb/>
her want of training and discipline would stand very <lb/>
much in the way of her success in the mission which <lb/>
she wished to undertake; but instead of allowing her <lb/>
an opportunity of acquiring the necessary experience, <lb/>
he told her that her home duties were sufficient for <lb/>
her, if only she would think so.</p>
<p>Studying the girl's character in the light of her <lb/>
after-achievements, we cannot but judge that her <lb/>
father somewhat miscalculated her ability and <reg orig="ener-|gies">energies</reg>, <lb/>
and the exercise which they craved; and, while <lb/>
we should be far from encouraging the conceit of <lb/>
every inexperienced girl who felt herself fitted for <lb/>
higher things and rebelled at the humble ministries <lb/>
which life demanded of her, we think that Dorothy <lb/>
Pattison was sufficiently unique in both mental and <lb/>
physical constitution to be pardoned for desiring more <lb/>
room for the development of her extraordinary powers.</p>
<p>She has been called "restless," and represented as <lb/>
finding home-life "distasteful," but it seems to have <lb/>
only been the restlessness of a strong young creature <lb/>
chafing against the bars of a too narrow cage.</p>
<pb n="97" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0108"/>
<p>Dora, however, submitted for some years to the <lb/>
parental prohibition, and busied herself, with her <lb/>
sister, in nursing their mother, who was a great <reg orig="in-|valid">invalid</reg>, <lb/>
and in paying long visits to her elder brother, <lb/>
Mr. Mark Pattison, of Lincoln College, Oxford, who <lb/>
allowed her to help him both in his literary and <lb/>
mechanical work.</p>
<p>It was during one of her visits to this brother that <lb/>
Dora experienced one of those singular presentiments <lb/>
to which she all her life paid great, and, as it several <lb/>
times appeared, not unfounded regard. She had a <lb/>
dream, in which her mother appeared to her, drawing <lb/>
back the curtain of her bed and calling her by name.</p>
<p>Fearing to be laughed at by her matter-of-fact <lb/>
brother, she forbore to tell him of this dream, but the <lb/>
next night it was repeated, her mother calling her as <lb/>
before, and looking worn and ill. Then Dora insisted, <lb/>
in spite of her brother's ridicule, in sending to the <lb/>
neighbouring town for letters; and one was found <lb/>
there, three days delayed, which told that Mrs. Pattison <lb/>
was dangerously ill.</p>
<p>Dora set off homeward at once, to be with her <lb/>
mother, who was lying upon her death-bed, and shortly <lb/>
afterwards passed away.</p>
<p>After this bereavement, Dora's desire to leave home <lb/>
was stronger than ever. She longed to join a Church <lb/>
of England sisterhood, calling themselves the Good <lb/>
Samaritans, with some members of which she had <lb/>
become acquainted when visiting Redcar. Still Mr. <lb/>
Pattison disapproved; it was from him apparently <lb/>
that Dora inherited her inflexible will, along with his <lb/>
well-proportioned figure and stately bearing. Such <lb/>
instances of heredity are no uncommon cause of <lb/>
<pb n="98" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0109"/>
friction between parent and child. But, eventually, a <lb/>
sort of compromise was arrived at, Dora being <reg orig="per-|mitted">permitted</reg>, <lb/>
though not cordially, to accept the position of <lb/>
village school-mistress in the parish of Little Woolston, <lb/>
near Bletchley, on the borders of Buckinghamshire.</p>
<p>Mr. Pattison told her that he should give her no <lb/>
more than the allowance she had always received, <lb/>
which, in addition to the school-mistress's modest <lb/>
salary, was all she would have to live upon. Possibly <lb/>
he imagined that the young lady would soon tire of <lb/>
a life of hard work and comparative privation and be <lb/>
glad to return, with chastened spirit, to the comforts <lb/>
of an affluent home.</p>
<p>With many, such would have been the result, but <lb/>
not with Dorothy Pattison. For three years she lived <lb/>
bravely and cheerily at Woolston, in a cottage all <lb/>
alone, and with no help in her domestic work except <lb/>
that of an old woman who came occasionally to do <lb/>
the hardest scrubbing.</p>
<p>She always loved little children, possessing a rare <lb/>
faculty for controlling, even while she made herself <lb/>
one with them; securing obedience to necessary rules <lb/>
in school time, though in play-hours she became a <lb/>
child again herself, delighting "in animals, flowers, a <lb/>
sunshiny day, a roll in a hay-cock, or a game of play <lb/>
of any kind."</p>
<p>Needless to say, Dora's beauty, her charming and <lb/>
high-bred manners, her ready smile, and the <reg orig="affec-|tionate">affectionate</reg> <lb/>
interest she took in her scholars and their <lb/>
homes, made her greatly beloved at Little Woolston, <lb/>
and here, too, among the poor and sick, she gained a <lb/>
great deal of that tact and experience which was <reg orig="by-|and-by">by-and-by</reg> <lb/>
to be so useful to her.</p>
<pb n="99" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0110"/>
<p>Although the young school-mistress did the most <lb/>
menial of her own house work, even blacking her grate <lb/>
with her own pretty hands, she was soon recognised <lb/>
as "a perfect lady" by those among whom she had <lb/>
taken up her abode. An old gentleman and his wife <lb/>
in the neighbourhood took such a fancy to her that <lb/>
they offered to make her their heiress. This <reg orig="gentle-|man">gentleman</reg>, <lb/>
after Dora had left Little Woolston, used to send <lb/>
her ten pounds regularly every year to do as she liked <lb/>
with, on condition only that she should not <reg orig="acknow-|ledge">acknowledge</reg> <lb/>
the gift. However, she did acknowledge it&mdash; <lb/>
a piece of her old wilfulness&mdash;which eventually caused <lb/>
the privilege to be withdrawn.</p>
<p>A neglected cold&mdash;Dora, like most women of her <lb/>
type, finding it much easier to take care of others than <lb/>
of herself&mdash;resulted in a sharp attack of pleurisy, and <lb/>
brought her work at Little Woolston to an end. She <lb/>
went to Redcar to recuperate, and here the old <reg orig="yearn-|ing">yearning</reg> <lb/>
to join the Sisterhood was revived. She only <lb/>
went back to the scene of her scholastic labours to say <lb/>
good-bye to her friends, and then, in the autumn of <lb/>
1864, she attached herself to the Sisterhood of the <lb/>
Good Samaritans.</p>
<p>It is difficult to say whether, up to this point, Dora, <lb/>
notwithstanding her many good qualities, could be <lb/>
called a truly converted character. Before leaving <lb/>
home the first time, she had come under the influence <lb/>
of a mind more powerful than her own, and one <lb/>
which, alas! had tended only to shake her faith in the <lb/>
authenticity and inspiration of the Scriptures. <reg orig="Per-|haps">Perhaps</reg> <lb/>
it was in the hope that amid distinctly religious <lb/>
associations her difficulties might melt away; or <lb/>
perhaps she sought the aid of outward discipline in <lb/>
<pb n="100" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0111"/>
enabling her to manage that strong and indomitable <lb/>
will which might prove her greatest blessing, or the <lb/>
reverse. However that may be, Dorothy Pattison at <lb/>
the mature age of thirty-two voluntarily yielded <reg orig="her-|self">herself</reg> <lb/>
up, mind and body, to the dictates of a "Mother <lb/>
Superior," and became "Sister Dora" for evermore.</p>
<p>Everyone knows of the severe drilling in absolute <lb/>
submission and unquestioning obedience to which <lb/>
members of these sisterhoods, whether Romish or <lb/>
Protestant, are subjected; that any intelligent human <lb/>
being should relinquish her independence to the <reg orig="ex-|tent">extent</reg> <lb/>
demanded by those in authority is a marvel, and <lb/>
it is a greater marvel that such regimen should often <lb/>
appear most attractive to self-willed characters; but <lb/>
perhaps those feel a need of being broken in.</p>
<p>Sister Dora, however, was not conquered all at once, <lb/>
if indeed at all. The rough and menial work which <lb/>
was demanded of her was distasteful, and she sat <lb/>
down and cried, when, already tired out with heavy <lb/>
and unaccustomed labour, she was commanded to <reg orig="re-|make">remake</reg> <lb/>
the beds which she had just put in order, and <lb/>
which had been immediately pulled to pieces at the <lb/>
whim of some superior authority. Nevertheless, she <lb/>
was afterwards wont to assert that this harsh <reg orig="treat-|ment">treatment</reg> <lb/>
was "good" for her. No doubt, the intimate <lb/>
knowledge of all departments of domestic work which <lb/>
she gained at Coatham&mdash;where the head-quarters of <lb/>
the sisterhood were situated&mdash;proved most useful to <lb/>
her in her later life.</p>
<p>After a while, Sister Dora was removed to a more <lb/>
congenial sphere of labour, namely, a Cottage Hospital <lb/>
at North Ormesby, near Middlesborough, which was <lb/>
worked by the "Samaritan" Sisters. And here she <lb/>
<pb n="101" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0112"/>
obtained her first practical knowledge of hospital <lb/>
management.</p>
<p>In the early part of 1865, she was sent to Walsall, <lb/>
afterwards to be indissolubly connected with her name.</p>
<p>Here, in one of the grimiest towns of the "Black <lb/>
Country," had been established a small hospital for <lb/>
the relief of accidents, under the control of the "Good <lb/>
Samaritans." At first the Sisters had been much <lb/>
opposed, owing to their supposed leanings towards <lb/>
Roman Catholicism, but gradually they won for <reg orig="them-|selves">themselves</reg> <lb/>
a good reputation by deeds of kindness and <lb/>
mercy, and almost the last instance of active <reg orig="persecu-|tion">persecution</reg> <lb/>
was the throwing of a stone at Sister Dora soon <lb/>
after her arrival, with the jeer of "There goes one of <lb/>
those Sisters of Misery!" We may add that she not <lb/>
long after had the pleasure of piling "coals of fire" <lb/>
upon the head of her assailant, by her devoted care of <lb/>
him when suffering from an injury received in a coal-pit.</p>
<p>Sister Dora had not been long at Walsall before <lb/>
she caught small-pox from the out-patients. She was <lb/>
very ill for some time, but does not seem to have had <lb/>
her beautiful skin marred in the slightest degree by <lb/>
the dreadful disease.</p>
<p>At this first visit our heroine was allowed to remain <lb/>
but a short time at Walsall, and seems for the <reg orig="re-|mainder">remainder</reg> <lb/>
of that year &lpar;1865&rpar; to have been sent <reg orig="back-|wards">backwards</reg> <lb/>
and forwards between Coatham, Walsall, and <lb/>
other places, in a disturbing fashion, probably designed <lb/>
to complete her education in perfect obedience.</p>
<p>But the finishing touch as regarded that <reg orig="indispens-|able">indispensable</reg> <lb/>
virtue was given about the middle of December.</p>
<p>The people of Walsall had by this time seen enough <lb/>
of Sister Dora to have some idea of her superior <lb/>
<pb n="102" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0113"/>
capabilities as a nurse. When, therefore, the <reg orig="Sister-|hood">Sisterhood</reg> <lb/>
proposed removing her permanently to <reg orig="Middles-|borough">Middlesborough</reg>, <lb/>
the committee and medical attendants at <lb/>
the Walsall Hospital objected.</p>
<p>While this subject was under discussion, news came <lb/>
to Sister Dora that her father was lying dangerously <lb/>
ill at Hauxwell. Having just received orders to go and <lb/>
nurse a private case in Devonshire, she telegraphed to <lb/>
Coatham for permission to go to her father instead.</p>
<p>It was refused, and the order to set out for <reg orig="Devon-|shire">Devonshire</reg> <lb/>
peremptorily repeated.</p>
<p>Dorothy's behaviour at this crisis shows, as Mrs. Henry <lb/>
Fawcett wisely observes, "the paralysis of moral sense <lb/>
which this cast-iron system &lpar;of obedience&rpar; produces."</p>
<p>The woman who resolutely followed the dictates of <lb/>
her own judgment in joining this Sisterhood when all <lb/>
her relations and friends were strongly opposed to it, <lb/>
had, in little more than one year, become so crushed <lb/>
and spiritless as to actually turn her back upon her own <lb/>
dying father at the command of a "Mother Superior"!</p>
<p>But the punishment which she thus brought upon <lb/>
herself, terrible as it was, seems to have stung Sister <lb/>
Dora into something like healthy life again.</p>
<p>The poor old father died, without a last glimpse of <lb/>
the "Sunshine" for whom he craved. <hi rend="italic">Then</hi>, Dora <lb/>
received permission to attend his funeral. But <reg orig="pos-|sibly">possibly</reg> <lb/>
shrinking from meeting her family under such <lb/>
painful circumstances, this was declined, with some <lb/>
bitter but well-deserved allusions to the prohibition <lb/>
which had preceded it; and from that time the bonds <lb/>
were gradually loosened between Sister Dora and <lb/>
the powers at Coatham, until eventually she became <lb/>
once more free.</p>

"A WINGLESS WEEK-DAY ANGEL."</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> authorities connected with the "Good <lb/>
Samaritan" Sisterhood having agreed to allow <lb/>
Sister Dora to remain in charge of the hospital at <lb/>
Walsall, she entered upon her permanent duties there <lb/>
with an eagerness which was doubtless in some <reg orig="meas-|ure">measure</reg> <lb/>
an attempt to drown sorrow with incessant work.</p>
<p>An intensifying of her religious feelings about this <lb/>
period, and a conviction that she was specially called <lb/>
by the Saviour to bring souls to Himself, would <lb/>
indeed have prompted her to exchange her adherence <lb/>
to the Order of the "Good Samaritans" for one of <lb/>
even stricter rule, demanding vows of celibacy, but <lb/>
this time the advice of friends prevailed, and she <lb/>
decided to remain where she was.</p>
<p>Sister Dora commenced her labours at Walsall so <lb/>
modestly and unobtrusively that her coming seems <lb/>
to have made no memorable impression upon anyone <lb/>
whom she met; but, like the broken cruse of perfume, <lb/>
a life like hers, pouring out sweetness and balm, could <lb/>
not long be hid. When her self-neglectful habit of <lb/>
sitting in damp clothes, rather than take the time and <lb/>
trouble to change them, eventually resulted in a <lb/>
severe illness, the anxious inquiries about her with <lb/>
which the hospital was besieged showed that her <lb/>
ministries among the very poorest of the people&mdash; <lb/>
those who were actually too low and wretched even <lb/>
to present themselves among the out-patients for <reg orig="treat-|ment&mdash;had">treatment&mdash;had</reg> <lb/>
not been without the fruit of grateful love.</p>
<p>It was during this illness that Dorothy made the <lb/>
<pb n="104" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0115"/>
acquaintance of the Rev. Richard Twigg, incumbent <lb/>
of St. James's, Wednesbury, whose teaching was her <lb/>
spiritual food and inspiration, and whose sympathy <lb/>
was her chief human support during the remainder of <lb/>
her life. It has been said that Mr. Twigg was almost <lb/>
the only friend who took pains not to gratify that love <lb/>
of admiration&mdash;excusable in so rarely and variously <lb/>
gifted a woman, if in any one! &mdash; which sometimes <lb/>
threatened to become a blemish in Sister Dora's <lb/>
beautiful character. He was not rendered dumb, as <lb/>
were most of the other men she met, by the charm of <lb/>
her brightness and beauty, but boldly found fault <lb/>
with her when he thought there was occasion, and by <lb/>
this means won her deepest respect.</p>
<p>In 1867, the Cottage Hospital proving inadequate <lb/>
to the needs of an increasing population, a larger one <lb/>
was built in a higher and more healthy situation. <lb/>
Here, in 1868, Sister Dora assumed full charge, and <lb/>
with the exception of one helper, a Mrs. H., who had <lb/>
known and loved her from childhood, and a couple of <lb/>
domestic servants, had the sole management of both <lb/>
indoor and out-patient departments; thus earning <lb/>
from her great friend, Bishop Selwyn, the well-merited <lb/>
title of "the one-horse chay."</p>
<p>Almost our heroine's first experience in her new <lb/>
quarters was that of an epidemic of small-pox.</p>
<p>Already exposed as the hospital and all connected <lb/>
with it were to the risk of contagion from out-patients, <lb/>
who sometimes came to have their wounds dressed <lb/>
with the eruption actually upon them, Sister Dora <lb/>
thought it could hardly be increased if she ventured <lb/>
to nurse the poor sufferers in their own homes. Thus, <lb/>
by economising her time, curtailing her own <reg orig="meal-|times">mealtimes</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="105" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0116"/>
and rest, and by lavish expenditure of that <lb/>
strength and energy with which she was so <reg orig="pheno-|menally">phenomenally</reg> <lb/>
endowed, she contrived to keep up all <reg orig="cus-|tomary">customary</reg> <lb/>
attendance to cases at the hospital, and also <lb/>
to carry her helpful ministrations into many a <reg orig="plague-|stricken">plague-stricken</reg> <lb/>
lane or slum of the town.</p>
<p>One night she was watching alone the last hours of <lb/>
a poor man who was dying of small-pox in its most <lb/>
virulent form. He was much attached to her, and as <lb/>
he felt his end nearing, probably being past realising <lb/>
the loathsome condition he was in, he raised himself <lb/>
up in bed and said, "Sister, kiss me before I die!"</p>
<p>And, taking him in her arms, Sister Dora complied <lb/>
with his request. Afterwards, in total darkness, the <lb/>
one bit of candle having expired, she sat with him <lb/>
until he died.</p>
<p>Her knowledge of surgery &mdash; obtained at first <lb/>
by careful attention to the painstaking teaching <lb/>
of the doctor who attended the old hospital&mdash;had <lb/>
by this time become greatly enlarged. She was <reg orig="ex-|tremely">extremely</reg> <lb/>
clever at bone-setting, having, as might be <lb/>
expected, an exquisitely delicate touch, and she was <lb/>
strongly opposed to amputation except in cases of <lb/>
extreme danger.</p>
<p>On one occasion it was her proud and happy <lb/>
experience to save, by three weeks' incessant care, <lb/>
the mangled right arm of a young man who had met <lb/>
with a machinery accident, after the surgeon attending <lb/>
the case had declared it to be impossible. She called <lb/>
it <hi rend="italic">her</hi> arm, and long afterwards, when she was herself <lb/>
ill, the grateful patient would ring at the hospital <lb/>
door to inquire how she was, sending in the message, <lb/>
"Tell Sister it's <hi rend="italic">her arm</hi> that pulled the bell!"</p>
<pb n="106" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0117"/>
<p>Sister Dora was a great believer in the efficacy of <lb/>
prayer, and in this instance, as in many others, held <lb/>
that it was in answer to her fervent entreaties that the <lb/>
healing was granted which she so earnestly besought.</p>
<p>The sick children loved her. No one was so bright <lb/>
and funny with them as Sister Dora, no one was so <lb/>
strong and patient, or told such charming tales. Those <lb/>
who cried most bitterly for their mothers could soon be <lb/>
pacified if carried about by her on one arm, while she <lb/>
attended to the wants of grown-up patients with her <lb/>
other hand; and they would allow her to do things for <lb/>
them without a murmur that no one else could attempt.</p>
<p>Sister Dora's ever bubbling humour and merriment <lb/>
was one of her greatest gifts, and an inestimable <reg orig="bless-|ing">blessing</reg> <lb/>
both to herself and her charges. She managed <lb/>
to see the comical side in almost everything, and to <lb/>
make others share in her amusement.</p>
<p>The singularly perfect balance of her whole being, <lb/>
physical strength in proportion to her mental energy, <lb/>
and practical ability equal to both, had no doubt much <lb/>
to do with this marvellous woman's joyous and <reg orig="hope-|ful">hopeful</reg> <lb/>
disposition; for there was no wearisome fretting of <lb/>
the body against the spirit, and <hi rend="italic">vice vers&acirc;</hi>, no chafing <lb/>
of what she <hi rend="italic">would</hi> do against the limitations of what <lb/>
she <hi rend="italic">could</hi>. With Sister Dora, to will was to do. At <lb/>
the same time it is on record that her fortitude under <lb/>
physical pain was nothing short of Spartan; personal <lb/>
suffering she was able absolutely to ignore, and as was <lb/>
proved in her latter years she was able to work, to be <lb/>
cheerful and gay, even as it appeared, to thoroughly <lb/>
enjoy herself while bearing serious discomfort, if not <lb/>
acute pain.</p>
<p>Her muscular strength has been described by a <lb/>
<pb n="107" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0118"/>
doctor who knew her intimately as simply "gigantic." <lb/>
If a heavy man threw himself out of bed in delirium, <lb/>
she would pick him up in her arms as if he had been <lb/>
a child and put him back again. She was even known <lb/>
to carry, unaided, the dead body of an adult patient <lb/>
from the ward where he died, to the mortuary, rather <lb/>
than allow the corpse to remain in the same <reg orig="apart-|ment">apartment</reg> <lb/>
with sick persons.</p>
<p>This strength of limb was matched by firmness of <lb/>
nerve and general power of endurance. When the <lb/>
never-to-be-forgotten explosion occurred at the <reg orig="Bur-|chills">Burchills</reg> <lb/>
Ironworks, in which eleven men were most <reg orig="shock-|ingly">shockingly</reg> <lb/>
burned by molten metal, no woman could go <lb/>
near the unhappy sufferers on account of the fearful <lb/>
sight and smell of their charred bodies, but Sister Dora. <lb/>
Even the medical men of the town were "incessantly <lb/>
sick, and could hardly stay in the ward."</p>
<p>For ten days on this occasion she never went to bed <lb/>
and scarcely ever left the ward. Her friend, the <lb/>
secretary of the hospital, did all he could for her, and <lb/>
one brave lady helper contrived to stay with her at <lb/>
night. Only two of the sufferers recovered, and it <lb/>
soon became evident that the ward in which they had <lb/>
all been nursed had become so completely <reg orig="impreg-|nated">impregnated</reg> <lb/>
with the poison from their wounds as to be <lb/>
rendered permanently useless, case after case of <reg orig="ery-|sipelas">erysipelas</reg> <lb/>
occurring in subsequent patients.</p>
<p>This ultimately necessitated the pulling down of <lb/>
nearly the whole hospital, but of that more anon. We <lb/>
mention the episode here, though it belongs to a later <lb/>
period of Sister Dora's history, as an instance of what <lb/>
she could and did bear in the way of personal <reg orig="incon-|venience">inconvenience</reg> <lb/>
for the sake of her patients.</p>
<pb n="108" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0119"/>
<p>She never wearied of attending to their smallest <lb/>
needs. Above every bed was a rope communicating <lb/>
with a bell at the head of her own bed. No matter <lb/>
how many times in the night the bell was rung, no <lb/>
sufferer ever had to ring twice to bring Sister Dora to <lb/>
his side, and ever she came with a bright face.</p>
<p>"Don't trouble about that!" was her cheerful reply, <lb/>
if any of her charges apologised for often disturbing <lb/>
her. "I am here to wait upon you, and I am always <lb/>
pleased to render you any assistance in your suffering."</p>
<p>Sister Dora's courage equalled her endurance. She <lb/>
would venture on her errands of mercy into the lowest <lb/>
parts of the town, amongst persons of the worst repute, <lb/>
at any hour of the day or night. She would not <lb/>
hesitate to interfere in a street brawl, and with her <lb/>
own strong hands part the furious combatants. <lb/>
But the moral influence won by her compassionate <lb/>
tenderness to the poorest of the people, of whom in <lb/>
the course of years there were few who had not for <lb/>
some cause or other passed under her care, was such <lb/>
that Sister Dora was a sacred being in Walsall, and her <lb/>
very name a talisman to ensure immunity from harm.</p>
<p>When war was being waged in Servia, our heroine <lb/>
longed to go out and nurse the wounded, <reg orig="circum-|stances">circumstances</reg> <lb/>
just then offering some possibility of leaving, <lb/>
for a time, her hospital work.</p>
<p>"But, Sister Dora," it was suggested, "do you think <lb/>
your sex or position would be a safeguard against <lb/>
those barbarous Turks?" "No, not at all," was the <lb/>
reply. "But then I have only one life, and it doesn't <lb/>
altogether rest with them whether I lose it or not." <lb/>
"But they don't kill people right off," argued the <lb/>
objector; "they mutilate them." "Yes; cut off my <lb/>
<pb n="109" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0120"/>
ears, and my nose; and if they did that, I should say, <lb/>
'Take my life.'" "Well, and if they did all that?" <lb/>
"Then," was the calm response, "I should 'enter into <lb/>
life maimed.'"</p>
<p>Of two things, however, Sister Dora was afraid, <lb/>
dogs &lpar;strange to say!&rpar; and rats. "She would," says <lb/>
her biographer, Miss Lonsdale, "shrink behind a <reg orig="com-|panion">companion</reg> <lb/>
if she met even a very small cur in the streets." <lb/>
And an account of a fight with a rat in one of the <lb/>
hospital passages we have in her own graphic words. <lb/>
She assaulted it with a poker, uttering a scream with <lb/>
every blow she dealt. All the patients who were <lb/>
able to get out of bed, crowded to watch the fray. <lb/>
"Give it him, Sister!" they cried. "But," she <reg orig="con-|cluded">concluded</reg>, <lb/>
in describing the scene to a visitor, "what <lb/>
nerves he must have had to stand my yells as well as <lb/>
the dabs with the poker! I should have thought <lb/>
either sufficient to frighten any ordinary rat to death."</p>
<p>Our sketch of Sister Dora's character would be <lb/>
sadly imperfect did we not speak of her earnest <lb/>
piety and her constant desire to be a means of <lb/>
bringing health to the souls as well as the bodies of <lb/>
her patients. She read prayers with them daily, <lb/>
taking her stand in such a position on one of the <lb/>
landings that those in each of the three wards could <lb/>
hear and join in, and it was no uncommon thing, <lb/>
when it was her turn to watch at night, for a sick <lb/>
man to find her on her knees by his bedside, praying <lb/>
individually for him.</p>
<p>"Oh, how sorry we shall be," she once wrote to <lb/>
a friend, "&lpar;if there be sorrow in heaven&rpar;, if we should <lb/>
enter in at the gate, and enjoy ourselves to all <lb/>
eternity, to think how little we did to help others <lb/>
<pb n="110" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0121"/>
on the narrow way! When I think of it I feel as if <lb/>
I could be all day long on my knees, praying for <lb/>
poor sinners; and I am overwhelmed with regret <lb/>
when I think of the hours I have wasted&mdash;the souls <lb/>
that have come and gone out of the hospital, and <lb/>
I have not led them to Christ."</p>
<p>Whenever a mission was held in Walsall, Sister <lb/>
Dora, notwithstanding that her life was already <lb/>
crammed to overflowing with work, would not only <lb/>
find time to attend the services herself, but what <lb/>
was infinitely more useful, she would take pains <lb/>
to persuade as many as she could of her present <lb/>
and former patients to go with her.</p>
<p>In this work, her intimate knowledge of, and great <lb/>
influence over the lower classes in the town was an <lb/>
immense help to her. On one occasion, by venturing <lb/>
into one of the vilest slums in the place, she persuaded <lb/>
a number of "fallen" women&mdash;a class for whom she <lb/>
had long felt the utmost concern&mdash;to go to midnight <lb/>
meetings arranged for their special benefit. During <lb/>
that particular mission week she would seem to have <lb/>
laboured almost incessantly, both by night and day.</p>
<p>Just at that time, her hospital labours were <reg orig="in-|creased">increased</reg> <lb/>
rather than diminished by a necessary move <lb/>
into a temporary house; notwithstanding, "as soon <lb/>
as she had 'dressed her wounds' as she called it, and <lb/>
put all her patients to bed, she started forth to her <lb/>
cabmen's gathering. When that was over she must <lb/>
have gone straight on to the midnight meeting; and <lb/>
when it is remembered that she never appeared in the <lb/>
wards of her hospital later than 6.30 A.M., it becomes <lb/>
evident that she burnt both ends of the candle at once, <lb/>
and that pretty fiercely, during the mission week."</p>
<pb n="111" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0122"/>
<p>Sister Dora's devoted friend, Miss Ridsdale, has <lb/>
called her in some sweet verses which we regret that <lb/>
space forbids us to quote, "A wingless, week-day <lb/>
angel," and the whole of her fourteen years' labour at <lb/>
Walsall,&mdash;the flower of her all too short life,&mdash;was <lb/>
a living embodiment of the sentiments of Wesley's <lb/>
hymn&mdash;a great favourite with her, of which one verse <lb/>
exhorts as follows:&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l rend="indent">"Then let us attend</l>
<l rend="indent">Our Heavenly Friend,</l>
<l rend="indent">In His members distrest,</l>
<l>By want or affliction or sickness opprest;</l>
<l rend="indent">The prisoner relieve,</l>
<l rend="indent">The stranger receive;</l>
<l rend="indent">Supply all their wants,</l>
<l>And spend and be spent in assisting His saints,</l>
<l rend="indent">By word and by deed,</l>
<l rend="indent">The bodies in need,</l>
<l rend="indent">The souls to relieve,</l>
<l>And, freely as Jesus hath given, to give."</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>In the second small-pox epidemic at Walsall, <lb/>
which occurred in 1875, Sister Dora left the Cottage <lb/>
Hospital on the hill in charge of her assistants, and <lb/>
went to superintend the epidemic hospital down in <lb/>
the town. She was induced to do this by the fact <lb/>
that nothing would persuade the sufferers from that <lb/>
fearfully contagious malady to quit their homes and <lb/>
avail themselves of the isolation so strongly necessary <lb/>
but the knowledge that they were to be nursed by <lb/>
their beloved Sister Dora.</p>
<p>In this place, amid scenes and experiences too <lb/>
loathsome to describe, was the devoted woman <reg orig="im-|mured">immured</reg> <lb/>
from February until August of that memorable <lb/>
year, often with little help, or none at all, cooking, <lb/>
<pb n="112" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0123"/>
cleaning, day and night nursing, all to be done by <lb/>
one pair of hands! No wonder a doctor said&mdash;on <lb/>
hearing how she had grappled with a delirious man, <lb/>
a big, heavy fellow, in the worst stage of the disease, <lb/>
holding him in bed by main force until assistance <lb/>
arrived&mdash;"Her strength was superhuman. I never <lb/>
saw such a woman."</p>
<p>And if her physical power be so described. what <lb/>
shall we say of her self-sacrificing devotion, when <lb/>
we read that "she was in the habit of bringing back <lb/>
to life, patients who had sunk into the first stage of <lb/>
the fatal collapse which often precedes death from <lb/>
small-pox, by actually putting her mouth to theirs, <lb/>
and breathing into them, until vitality was restored"?</p>
<p>With such an angelic nature, we do not love Sister <lb/>
Dora the less for glimpses of tastes and desires <reg orig="in-|tensely">intensely</reg> <lb/>
human, and an evidence of her thorough <lb/>
naturalness is afforded by her request, at this trying <lb/>
time, for sensational novels, to keep her awake when <lb/>
watching with the sick at night, and by her na&iuml;ve <reg orig="con-|fession">confession</reg> <lb/>
afterwards, "Oh, I did enjoy those stories!" <lb/>
Indeed, she was ready to enjoy everything from <lb/>
which any form of innocent pleasure&mdash;mental, moral, <lb/>
spiritual, or physical&mdash;was to be obtained, from the <lb/>
quiet seclusion of the epidemic hospital during Lent, <lb/>
to a peep at a military review, or the comical notion <lb/>
of a patient that a bite from a dog might be healed <lb/>
by plastering the wound with dog's hairs!</p>
<p>She played as vigorously as she worked. Her <lb/>
holidays were few and brief, but how she revelled <lb/>
in them! Laying aside her "sister's" dress for <lb/>
greater freedom and to avoid comment, she bathed <lb/>
or skated, walked or swam, as the season dictated <lb/>
<pb n="113" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0124"/>
A friend with whom she spent one of her latest <lb/>
vacations says that "under her leadership we scaled <lb/>
fences, forded streams, with or without <reg orig="stepping-|stones">steppingstones</reg>, <lb/>
wished at the Wishing Well, and enjoyed <lb/>
a thorough scramble." Once, when at the sea-side, <lb/>
she merrily took a shrimping-net from the hands of <lb/>
a poor old woman who was wielding it with small <lb/>
success, and soon succeeded in catching for her eight <lb/>
or ten-pennyworth, being proportionately delighted <lb/>
with her success.</p>
<p>She was, indeed, up to this time an instance of <lb/>
<foreign lang="ita"><hi rend="italic">mens sana in corpore sano;</hi></foreign> but, alas! a time was <lb/>
near when that bright spirit would be called to a <lb/>
dire inward conflict with disease and death.</p>

SUNDOWN AT NOON.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">It</hi> must occur to some readers to wonder that, with <lb/>
all her attractive gifts of mind and body, Sister <lb/>
Dora was never married.</p>
<p>Twice the opportunity was presented to her; the <lb/>
first time, which was before she left Coatham, her <lb/>
affections were not sufficiently engaged to induce her <lb/>
to give up the mode of life she had so recently chosen; <lb/>
but on the second occasion, some years after, she <lb/>
allowed herself to become actually betrothed.</p>
<p>The man, we are told&mdash;and how much of Sister <lb/>
Dora's heart-history may not be imagined from those <lb/>
few suggestive words!&mdash;"was her superior in every <lb/>
respect but one, he had no faith in revealed religion," <lb/>
and it is hinted that her attachment to him was very deep.</p>
<pb n="114" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0125"/>
<p>Her conduct in permitting an engagement to come <lb/>
about under such circumstances has been criticised by <lb/>
her biographer as most unfair to her lover and <reg orig="disre-|spectful">disrespectful</reg> <lb/>
to the faith which she professed, but we <reg orig="pre-|fer">prefer</reg> <lb/>
not to sit in judgment upon even the weaknesses <lb/>
of so noble a character. Suffice it to say, that when <lb/>
the friend whose advice she valued beyond all others <lb/>
urged upon her that nothing but apostasy or life-long <lb/>
unhappiness could be expected to result from such a <lb/>
union, she ultimately retracted her promise and turned <lb/>
her back for ever upon the joys of home life, and the <lb/>
possibility, always regarded by her as a supreme <reg orig="bless-|ing">blessing</reg>, <lb/>
of having little ones of her own to love and tend.</p>
<p>From this time forward, Sister Dora's disregard for <lb/>
her own health became greater than ever, and her <lb/>
confessed longing for the privilege of dying in the <lb/>
service of her fellow-creatures more intense.</p>
<p>It was in 1876 that, owing to the circumstances we <lb/>
have already recorded, it was decided to pull down <lb/>
the hospital which had been in use since 1868, and <lb/>
build a new and larger one. During the <reg orig="reconstruc-|tion">reconstruction</reg> <lb/>
the patients were removed to a house in the town, <lb/>
which proved very inconvenient and unsuitable for the <lb/>
purpose, besides entailing upon Sister Dora a walk of <lb/>
ten minutes up the hill in all weathers to give <reg orig="attend-|ance">attendance</reg> <lb/>
in the out-patients' department, which was still <lb/>
left standing, to the sixty or a hundred sufferers who <lb/>
would sometimes be seen by her in a single afternoon.</p>
<p>During the winter succeeding this temporary <lb/>
removal, Sister Dora, for the first time in her <reg orig="experi-|ence">experience</reg>, <lb/>
began to feel some failure of her wonderful <lb/>
strength. For some weeks she paid little heed, but as <lb/>
the difficulty increased instead of diminishing, she at <lb/>

last consulted a medical man, and submitted to an <lb/>
examination.</p>
<p>Soon she knew that the fiat had gone <reg orig="forth&mdash;ex-|pected">forth&mdash;expected</reg>, <lb/>
through some strange presentiment, for more <lb/>
than a year past, though not in the guise in which it <lb/>
actually came&mdash;"Thou shalt die, and not live."</p>
<p>Impelled by some motive which no one has been <lb/>
able quite to understand, Sister Dora extorted from <lb/>
this doctor a pledge of inviolable secrecy, and went on <lb/>
with her work just the same as usual.</p>
<p>Cancer, the dread disease which had claimed her for <lb/>
its victim, is of slow development. All through the <lb/>
year 1877 it preyed upon this Spartan woman <reg orig="unsus-|pected">unsuspected</reg> <lb/>
by the dearest friend, or those who worked with <lb/>
her night and day. Bright, merry, capable as ever, <lb/>
the only difference which might have struck those who <lb/>
knew her was that a little pony-carriage which had <lb/>
been presented to her as a tribute of gratitude some <lb/>
time before, was used more than formerly for driving <lb/>
to see patients who could not be received into the <lb/>
hospital.</p>
<p>In January, 1878, she wrote in acknowledgment of <lb/>
a letter received on her last birthday:&mdash;"I could go on <lb/>
writing until my ideas all ran to ink, and there would <lb/>
be none left. &hellip; It was a glad day to me. The world <lb/>
seemed so full of warm, loving hearts. Such lots of <lb/>
nice letters and remembrances; and then, I am so <lb/>
sure of the Loving Heart above, and being another <lb/>
year nearer Home."</p>
<p>To a perplexed young friend she wisely wrote: <lb/>
"No one thing in itself is much better than another, <lb/>
and no one can better themselves in any case by <reg orig="step-|ping">stepping</reg> <lb/>
out of the place in which the Master puts them."</p>
<pb n="118" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0129"/>
<p>In the month of June, 1878, Sister Dora went away <lb/>
for a fortnight's holiday, and almost immediately on <lb/>
her return an outbreak of typhoid fever necessitated <lb/>
the closing of the temporary hospital, and again <lb/>
released her from the work which she was destined <lb/>
never to resume. Then, the first use she made of her <lb/>
liberty was to gather together as many of her old <lb/>
patients as she could, with night nurses and servants <lb/>
connected with the hospital, and treat them all to a <lb/>
day's outing at Lichfield.</p>
<p>In the light of our knowledge that she had entered <lb/>
upon the last half-year of her life, it is almost <reg orig="in-|credible">incredible</reg> <lb/>
to read that "she was in unusually high <lb/>
spirits, talking and laughing with them in the train, <lb/>
and actually jumping out to gather some flowers <lb/>
which grew on the railway banks while the train <lb/>
stopped unexpectedly."</p>
<p>A little later she went to join some of her nieces in <lb/>
the Isle of Man, and on this occasion not only enjoyed <lb/>
sea-bathing herself, but took the opportunity of <reg orig="teach-|ing">teaching</reg> <lb/>
her nieces to swim.</p>
<p>In the autumn she went to Paris, to see the <reg orig="Exhibi-|tion">Exhibition</reg>, <lb/>
and was delighted with all she saw. But about <lb/>
the end of September came a sudden collapse. She <lb/>
was in London at the time, and at once hurried to <lb/>
Birmingham to consult the doctor who shared her <lb/>
terrible secret. Here she became so very ill, that it <lb/>
was feared she could not be removed to Walsall alive. <lb/>
Early in October, however, the journey was <reg orig="accom-|plished">accomplished</reg>.</p>
<p>For the next three months Sister Dora's sufferings <lb/>
were agonising. Once the wrote, "I have not had <lb/>
two hours' sleep for four days and nights, but in the <lb/>
<pb n="119" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0130"/>
midst of the fiery furnace there was a form like unto <lb/>
the Son of God."</p>
<p>Soon, however, writing became impossible, and she <lb/>
could only dictate letters to her friends, who were still <lb/>
kept in ignorance of the true nature of her complaint, <lb/>
and the disease being complicated with lung trouble <lb/>
which caused a racking cough, everybody believed <lb/>
that she was dying of consumption.</p>
<p>On the 4th of November, the new hospital was <lb/>
declared by the Mayor to be open "in the name of <lb/>
Sister Dora." It was a pathetic ceremony, for it <lb/>
was then known to all that in spite of lingering <lb/>
hopes, their "dear lady's" bright face would never <lb/>
smile among them again.</p>
<p>It was hard to realise, for she still rallied again <lb/>
and again, her marvellous constitution resisting the <lb/>
inroads of disease. On her better days, she would <lb/>
receive many visitors, and laugh and joke with them <lb/>
as of old, until the thought of death in connection <lb/>
with that irrepressible spirit appeared impossible. <lb/>
But there were other times when the horror of the <lb/>
approaching struggle seemed almost to overwhelm <lb/>
her. She believed it probable that the end would <lb/>
come during one of her severe fits of coughing, and <lb/>
the idea was terrible to her. Nevertheless, one of <lb/>
her nurses, who had watched many death-beds, <lb/>
testified, "I <hi rend="italic">never</hi> saw such faith and patience."</p>
<p>During the week before Christmas, she repeatedly <lb/>
said, "I hope I shall sing my Christmas Carol in <lb/>
heaven!" But release had been so long expected <lb/>
and delayed that as the days passed on it seemed <lb/>
unlikely that her desire would be granted.</p>
<p>But Heaven was merciful, and the last earthly <lb/>
<pb n="120" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0131"/>
wish of this prayerful soul who had won so many <lb/>
boons for others was not to be refused. On the <lb/>
afternoon of the 24th of December, the spirit of <lb/>
Sister Dora passed peacefully and painlessly away.</p>
<p>The funeral, by her own special request, was as <lb/>
plain as possible, but it was attended by <reg orig="grief-|stricken">grief-stricken</reg> <lb/>
mourners in throngs, from almost every <lb/>
rank in society, bishops and town magnates, rough <lb/>
men and ragged women, testifying alike, with tearful <lb/>
eyes, to the sincerity of their sorrow.</p>
<p>Various memorials have been raised by the people <lb/>
of Walsall in honour of her whom they love to call <lb/>
"<hi rend="italic">Our</hi> sister Dora." &pound;700 were collected for the <lb/>
Convalescent Home which was the object nearest <lb/>
to her heart at the time of her death; a life-like <lb/>
portrait of her was painted for the Board-Room of <lb/>
the Hospital; and a magnificent stained-glass window, <lb/>
costing about &pound;300, was placed in the parish church.</p>
<p>But the grandest and most conspicuous of all is <lb/>
the beautiful statue of Sister Dora, which occupies <lb/>
a central position in the town; this, with its pedestal <lb/>
and relievo representing her attending to the sufferers <lb/>
from the Burchills Explosion, cost &pound;1050, a great <lb/>
part of which was contributed in small sums by the <lb/>
working-men, who preferred a white marble statue to <lb/>
any other form of memorial. It was unveiled in the <lb/>
autumn of 1886, in the presence of about 40,000 <lb/>
spectators.</p>
<p>Commenting on this event, the <hi rend="italic">Standard</hi> summed <lb/>
up the character of Sister Dora as "a warm-hearted, <lb/>
tender, unaffected woman, who was loved&mdash;as Charles <lb/>
Lamb was said to love his friends&mdash;not in spite of <lb/>
her faults, but was loved, faults and all."</p>

A REMARKABLE CHILD.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">When</hi> some future historian takes up his pen <lb/>
to describe the social progress of England <lb/>
during the latter half of the nineteenth <lb/>
century, there will be one family, neither rich, titled, <lb/>
nor politically conspicuous, whose work and influence <lb/>
it will be impossible to ignore.</p>
<p>The world has probably never seen a more <reg orig="remark-|able">remarkable</reg> <lb/>
group of men and women, bound together by <lb/>
the closest ties of both sympathy and blood, than <lb/>
those bearing the now universally famous name of <lb/>
Booth, nor one whose spiritual power over their own <lb/>
generation has been so far-reaching and deep.</p>
<p>From Arctic snows to the burning sands of Africa, <lb/>
from inventive America to quaint Japan, the Salvation <lb/>
Army has become a household word, and the "Mother <lb/>
of the Army" was Catherine Booth.</p>
<p>Born at Ashbourne, in Derbyshire, in January, <lb/>
1829, when the reactionary fervour and strictness <lb/>
of Methodism was still thrilling a slumbering Church, <lb/>
<pb n="124" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0135"/>
Kate Mumford was reared in a family where both <lb/>
elements appear to have been exemplified in a marked <lb/>
degree. Her father, John Mumford, was a lay <lb/>
preacher belonging to the Wesleyan body, while <lb/>
her mother, a woman of great strength of character <lb/>
united to religious earnestness, though brought up <lb/>
in the Church of England, had been converted, before <lb/>
her marriage, under the influence of a Methodist <lb/>
mission.</p>
<p>Little Catherine, a striking-looking girl, with <reg orig="flash-|ing">flashing</reg> <lb/>
black eyes and curly hair, was the only daughter <lb/>
in a family of five, and of her brothers, the youngest <lb/>
alone survived his infancy; her position, therefore, <lb/>
was almost like that of an only child.</p>
<p>Mrs. Mumford held very decided views on the <lb/>
subject of the training of children, and so convinced <lb/>
was she of the prevalence of parental neglect and the <lb/>
dangers of bad companionship, that she did not <lb/>
permit her little girl and boy to mix with any <reg orig="play-|mates">playmates</reg> <lb/>
of their own age; nor did Catherine even attend <lb/>
school until she was twelve years old.</p>
<p>Mrs. Mumford, however, did her best to make <lb/>
up for this deprivation by being herself her little <lb/>
daughter's constant companion and confidante, and <lb/>
it is very possible that to a child of Catherine's <lb/>
delicate physique and precociously thoughtful mind, <lb/>
this comradeship was even more congenial than that <lb/>
of average juveniles would have been.</p>
<p>But although romping games and fascinating <reg orig="story-|books">storybooks</reg> <lb/>
were alike denied to little Kate, she was not <lb/>
wholly without the natural joys of childhood, for it is <lb/>
recorded that she possessed a family of dolls to which <lb/>
she was devotedly attached. As is usual with <lb/>
<pb n="125" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0136"/>
children, Kate's play was both a faithful reflection of <lb/>
her surroundings and a forecast of her future life. <lb/>
Not only did she wash, feed, and industriously sew <lb/>
for her wax and wooden babies, but we are told that <lb/>
she would even <hi rend="italic">pray</hi> with them, in the earnestness of <lb/>
her maternal zeal!</p>
<p>It is needless to say that Mrs. Mumford's daughter <lb/>
was early taught to read and love her Bible, and before <lb/>
she was twelve years old she had read entirely through <lb/>
the sacred book eight times, thus early acquiring that <lb/>
familiarity with Scripture which was to be of such <lb/>
service to the world in years to come.</p>
<p>Although trained, in some respects, with so much <lb/>
strictness, it would not appear that the little girl <lb/>
was unduly repressed. She was allowed to join in <lb/>
the conversation of her parents at an early age, and <lb/>
even when visitors were present. "By the time <lb/>
I was twelve," she says, "I had my own ideas in <lb/>
politics, and could fight my father across the table. <lb/>
Among other matters discussed was the Catholic <lb/>
Emancipation Bill. My father was in favour of it, <lb/>
while I was very much opposed to it, arguing that the <lb/>
way in which the Catholics had invariably misused <lb/>
political power proved that they were unfit to be <reg orig="in-|trusted">intrusted</reg> <lb/>
with it."</p>
<p>Catherine's sympathies were always with the poor <lb/>
and wretched, and being by moral constitution as <lb/>
high-spirited and brave as she was fragile in body, she <lb/>
never lacked the courage to act up to her convictions. <lb/>
A striking incident of early life will prove this.</p>
<p>While bowling her hoop in the street one day, she <lb/>
saw a drunken man being dragged to the <reg orig="police-|station">police-station</reg> <lb/>
by a constable, and followed by a jeering, <lb/>
<pb n="126" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0137"/>
hooting crowd. Instantly a sense of profound pity <lb/>
for the unfortunate culprit overmastered the horror <lb/>
which a gently nurtured little girl must naturally have <lb/>
felt, and springing to the man's side, Kate walked <lb/>
with him to the lock-up; a true foreshadowing of the <lb/>
courage and tenderness which in time to come was to <lb/>
make Mrs. Booth the friend and champion of the <reg orig="out-|cast">outcast</reg> <lb/>
all the world over.</p>
<p>Equally brave was she in defence of the dumb <reg orig="crea-|tion">creation</reg>, <lb/>
and many an over-driven horse or goaded sheep <lb/>
would have blessed the name of one who not only <lb/>
pitied its sufferings but had the courage to interfere on <lb/>
its behalf, had it but possessed the tongue to speak.</p>
<p>In after years she frequently took clandestine <lb/>
supplies of food to poor, under-fed animals which she <lb/>
noticed in the fields, and many a threepenny or <reg orig="six-|penny">sixpenny</reg> <lb/>
bit did she bestow upon seaside donkey-boys <lb/>
along with bright, kindly exhortations to be good to <lb/>
the animals in their care.</p>
<p>It is not surprising to learn that Kate Mumford was <lb/>
one of those children who take real pleasure in <reg orig="attend-|ance">attendance</reg> <lb/>
at religious services, nor that she was deeply and <lb/>
practically interested in the progress of missions to <lb/>
the heathen. She voluntarily denied herself, and was <lb/>
also indefatigable in begging for money from others <lb/>
in order to help in sending the Gospel abroad.</p>
<p>Another philanthropic movement which aroused <lb/>
the enthusiasm of this remarkable child was that for <lb/>
the promotion of total abstinence. Before she had <lb/>
reached her teens we find her writing impassioned <lb/>
letters to the magazines for which her father <reg orig="sub-|scribed">subscribed</reg>, <lb/>
concealing her identity beneath a <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italic">nom de <lb/>
plume</hi></foreign>, and even getting the manuscripts copied out by <lb/>
<pb n="127" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0138"/>
a friend that the editors might not be prejudiced by <lb/>
guessing the extreme youth of the writer. Whether <lb/>
any of these early effusions ever appeared in print, <lb/>
we are not told.</p>
<figure id="f25" rend="block" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0138">
<head>BEFRIENDING THE DRUNKARD.</head>
</figure>
<p>In the year 1834, the Mumfords removed to Boston <lb/>
in Lincolnshire, and amongst the members of the <lb/>
chapel there was a lady, of great devotion and ability, <lb/>
who was principal of a girls' school. So great was the <lb/>
friendship and esteem which Mrs. Mumford conceived <lb/>
<pb n="128" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0139"/>
for this lady, that in 1841 she arranged, prejudiced as <lb/>
she had previously been to any but home education, <lb/>
for Catherine to attend her seminary.</p>
<p>During the girl's two years of school life, she won <lb/>
the greatest affection and regard from her teacher, <lb/>
though even her unselfish dislike to surpass or <lb/>
humiliate others by her superior gifts did not wholly <lb/>
relieve her from the consequences of youthful jealousy. <lb/>
Possibly her long isolation from other children had <lb/>
somewhat unfitted her for their teasing and tricks, for <lb/>
we hear now of occasional violent outbursts of temper, <lb/>
for which, however, Kate was always deeply sorry <lb/>
when the irritation had passed away.</p>
<p>History and geography were her favourite studies, <lb/>
especially the former, and the way in which she would <lb/>
analyse and compare the characters brought before <lb/>
her, inquiring into their motives, and meditating on <lb/>
the use they made of their power, whether for selfish <lb/>
aggrandisement or the benefit of the poor, is another <lb/>
indication of the strong and early bent of her mind <lb/>
towards practical philanthropy.</p>
<p>Arithmetic she did not like, but in composition she <lb/>
excelled. We hear nothing about music, and French <lb/>
was a tabooed accomplishment on account of Mrs. <lb/>
Mumford's extreme fear that it might lead to the <lb/>
perusal of pernicious literature in that language. In <lb/>
after years, however, Catherine considered that in this <lb/>
particular her mother had made a mistake.</p>
<p>Kate's school days were of comparatively short <lb/>
duration. When she was fourteen years old they <lb/>
were brought to a premature close by an attack of <lb/>
spinal weakness, which compelled her to spend most <lb/>
of her time lying upon a couch.</p>
<pb n="129" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0140"/>
<p>It was at this period that, turning from the usual <lb/>
studies of girls of her age, Catherine devoted her <lb/>
enforced leisure to reading books dealing with Church <lb/>
history and theology. Wesley, Finney, Fletcher, <lb/>
Mosheim, and Neander followed closely on her <reg orig="fav-|ourite">favourite</reg> <lb/>
"Butler's Analogy" and "Pilgrim's Progress." <lb/>
She also carefully perused "Newton on Prophecy," <lb/>
coming to the conclusion with respect to the latter <lb/>
that she could better please God by preparing people <lb/>
for Christ's coming than by endeavouring to fix the <lb/>
date when it was to take place.</p>
<p>Miss Mumford seems to have been in every respect <lb/>
more early developed than the average girl, for she <lb/>
was only fifteen when there devolved upon her the <lb/>
serious responsibility of accepting or rejecting a <lb/>
would-be lover!</p>
<p>This young man, who was her cousin, was not <lb/>
without attractions, but his obviously worldly and <lb/>
irreligious character finally decided her to break off <lb/>
all correspondence with him, a step which she never <lb/>
afterwards had cause to regret.</p>

<div2 type="chapter" n="II" id="d31">
<head><hi rend="bold">CHAPTER II. <lb/>
CONVERSION AND CONSECRATION.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">In</hi> 1844 the Mumfords removed to London, and <lb/>
at length took up their residence at Brixton; <lb/>
here, not many months after her arrival, occurred <lb/>
what we may assuredly call the most important event <lb/>
of Catherine's life, namely, her conversion.</p>
<p>In accordance with the views of the religious body <lb/>
<pb n="130" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0141"/>
among whom she had been nurtured, the girl felt that <lb/>
some definite inward convulsion invariably <reg orig="accom-|panied">accompanied</reg> <lb/>
true change of heart, and this she was not <lb/>
aware as yet of having experienced. Therefore, <reg orig="al-|though">although</reg>, <lb/>
as she says, "I was conscious of having given <lb/>
myself up fully to God from my earliest years, and <lb/>
although I was anxious to serve Him and often <lb/>
realised deep enjoyment in prayer, nevertheless, I <lb/>
had not the positive assurance that my sins were <lb/>
forgiven."</p>
<p>The poor child, struggling for peace, passed through <lb/>
weeks of mental agony, often pacing her room until <lb/>
two o'clock in the morning, and when, utterly <reg orig="ex-|hausted">exhausted</reg>, <lb/>
she at length lay down to sleep, she would <lb/>
place her Bible and hymn-book under her pillow, <lb/>
praying that she might wake up with the assurance <lb/>
of salvation.</p>
<p>At length, one morning, when she opened her <lb/>
hymn-book, her eyes fell upon the words:&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l rend="indent">"My God, I am Thine!</l>
<l rend="indent">What a comfort Divine,&mdash;</l>
<l>What a blessing to know that my Jesus is mine."</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>Instantly, familiar as the lines had been before, <lb/>
they seemed invested with a new meaning; the <reg orig="long-|sought">long-sought</reg> <lb/>
"assurance of salvation" rushed in upon her <lb/>
soul like a flood, and, overwhelmed with joy, Catherine <lb/>
jumped out of bed and at once ran into her mother's <lb/>
room to tell the good news to her.</p>
<p>It was no doubt a remembrance of this episode <lb/>
which led Mrs. Booth in after years to insist so <lb/>
strongly on the possibility of immediate acceptance <lb/>
and instant salvation and joy, which was so marked a <lb/>
feature of her own ministrations to inquiring souls.</p>
<pb n="131" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0142"/>
<p>"For the next six months," she wrote, "I was so <lb/>
happy that I felt as if I were walking on air. I used <lb/>
to tremble, and even long to die, lest I should <reg orig="back-|slide">backslide</reg>, <lb/>
or lose the consciousness of God's smile and <lb/>
favour."</p>
<p>Catherine now joined the Wesleyan Church at <lb/>
Brixton; but although the Society had in London <lb/>
at that time some of its most able and eloquent <lb/>
preachers&mdash;the eminent Luke Tyerman being one of <lb/>
them&mdash;the young convert and her mother were not <lb/>
satisfied, because the services were unaccompanied by <lb/>
those unmistakable outward manifestations of <reg orig="re-|pentance">repentance</reg> <lb/>
and salvation which they deemed essential <lb/>
proofs of the work of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Of course Catherine's next step was to begin <lb/>
attending a class-meeting, much more stringently <lb/>
required of members of the Wesleyan body fifty years <lb/>
ago than now, and looked upon, indeed, as a <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italic">sine qu&acirc; <lb/>
non</hi></foreign> of the Christian life. This class she continued to <lb/>
attend for the next five years. Here she received <lb/>
her most valuable training in the art of speaking in <lb/>
public. For, whatever opinion we may entertain as <lb/>
to the desirability of forcing a young girl to pray <lb/>
aloud, and even keeping the rest of the class upon <lb/>
their knees for five minutes waiting for her to begin, <lb/>
when she was in such delicate health that the <reg orig="excite-|ment">excitement</reg> <lb/>
and exertion were making her ill, there is no <lb/>
doubt that to this rigorous discipline was owing much <lb/>
of Mrs. Booth's fluency and power in after life.</p>
<p>But although this experience was no hindrance to <lb/>
the young enthusiast, the fact that her class-leader's <lb/>
daughter was allowed to dress in accordance with the <lb/>
fashions of the world and become engaged to an <lb/>
<pb n="132" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0143"/>
unconverted young man, caused her the utmost sorrow <lb/>
and concern; for she feared that while such <reg orig="incon-|sistencies">inconsistencies</reg> <lb/>
were tolerated, little permanent good could <lb/>
be accomplished among members of the class.</p>
<p>Like many thoughtful Christians in the leisured <lb/>
days gone by, Catherine Mumford found pleasure in <lb/>
recording her religious symptoms and advancement. <lb/>
Thus in her eighteenth and nineteenth years we find <lb/>
such occasional entries in her diary as the following, <lb/>
written at Brighton, where she was staying for the <lb/>
benefit of her health:&mdash;</p>
<p>"14<hi rend="italic">th May</hi>, 1847.&mdash;This morning, while reading <lb/>
Rowe's 'Devout Exercises of the Heart,' I was much <lb/>
blessed, and enabled to give myself afresh into the <lb/>
hands of God, to do or to suffer all His will. Oh, <lb/>
that I may be made useful in this family! Lord, <lb/>
they know Thee not, neither do they seek Thee! <lb/>
Have mercy upon them, and help me to set an <reg orig="ex-|ample">example</reg>, <lb/>
at all times and in all places, worthy of <reg orig="imita-|tion">imitation</reg>. <lb/>
Help me to adorn the Gospel of God, my <lb/>
Saviour, in all things.</p>
<p>"I find much need of watchfulness and prayer, and <lb/>
have this day taken up my cross in reproving sin. <lb/>
Lord, follow with the conviction of Thy Spirit all I <lb/>
have said."</p>
<p>And again, on 28th November, she writes:&mdash;"This <lb/>
has been an especially good day to my soul. &hellip; My <lb/>
desires after holiness have been much increased. This <lb/>
day I have sometimes seemed on the verge of the <lb/>
good land. Oh, for mighty faith! I believe the <lb/>
Lord is willing and able to save me to the uttermost. <lb/>
I believe the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses from all <lb/>
sin. And yet there seems something in the way to <lb/>
<pb n="133" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0144"/>
prevent me from fully entering in. But to-day I <lb/>
believe at times I have had tastes of perfect love. <lb/>
Oh, that these may be droppings before an <reg orig="over-|whelming">overwhelming</reg> <lb/>
shower of grace! My chief desire is <reg orig="holi-|ness">holiness</reg> <lb/>
of heart. This is the prevailing cry of my soul."</p>
<p>At the beginning of the New Year &lpar;1848&rpar;, she has <lb/>
the following entry:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I have been writing a few daily rules for the <lb/>
coming year, which I hope will prove a blessing to me <lb/>
by the grace of God. &hellip; I have read my Bible <lb/>
through twice during the last sixteen months, but I <lb/>
must read it with more prayer for light and <reg orig="under-|standing">understanding</reg>. <lb/>
Oh, may it be my meat and drink! May <lb/>
I meditate on it day and night! and then I shall bring <lb/>
forth fruit in season, my leaf also shall not wither, and <lb/>
whatsoever I do shall prosper!"</p>
<p>A few days later we have a record which, <reg orig="consider-|ing">considering</reg> <lb/>
that shortly before the writer had owned to <lb/>
feeling "very poorly, and excessively low," does more <lb/>
credit to her zeal than her discretion:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I have renewed my practice of abstaining from <lb/>
dinner on a Friday, and from butter in the morning. <lb/>
&hellip; Oh, my Lord, help me to be more fully decided <lb/>
in all things, and not to confer with flesh and blood, <lb/>
but be bold to take up and firm to sustain the <reg orig="con-|secrated">consecrated</reg> <lb/>
cross."</p>
<p>It was about this time that a great agitation arose <lb/>
in the Wesleyan community, leading ultimately to <lb/>
the withdrawal or expulsion of about one hundred <lb/>
thousand of its members.</p>
<p>Briefly, the autocratic government of the hundred <lb/>
ministers, who in accordance with John Wesley's Deed <lb/>
Poll formed the Conference, aroused feelings of <reg orig="rebel-|lion">rebellion</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="134" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0145"/>
in the minds of certain of their brethren who were <lb/>
not thus in office. Anonymous pamphlets were <reg orig="pub-|lished">published</reg>, <lb/>
purporting to expose serious errors in the <lb/>
administration. These naturally gave great offence <lb/>
to the Conference, who endeavoured to fix upon the <lb/>
masked offenders, with the result that three ministers <lb/>
were expelled from the society, and a number of others <lb/>
severely reprimanded.</p>
<p>The numbers of malcontents, however, were <reg orig="in-|creased">increased</reg> <lb/>
rather than diminished by those stringent <lb/>
measures, and in a short time they had formed <reg orig="them-|selves">themselves</reg> <lb/>
into a body, subsequently known as the <lb/>
Reformers, and thousands of their sympathisers were <lb/>
virtually excommunicated by the Conference.</p>
<p>Miss Mumford was ever inclined to be on the side <lb/>
of the people, and those who seemed to be oppressed. <lb/>
Possessing from her earliest years, as we have seen, <lb/>
the courage of her convictions, she so boldly expressed <lb/>
her opinions on this subject as to draw upon herself <lb/>
the censure of her conservative-minded class-leader, <lb/>
who finding her firm in her sympathy with those whom <lb/>
she believed to be in the right, reluctantly decided to <lb/>
withhold her ticket of membership. In other words, <lb/>
Catherine Mumford was expelled from the Wesleyan <lb/>
Church.</p>
<p>The Reformers had by this time commenced to <lb/>
hold meetings in the neighbourhood of Catherine's <lb/>
home, and when she was offered by them the senior <lb/>
class in their Sunday School, she willingly accepted <lb/>
the post, and threw herself into the work with all her <lb/>
heart.</p>
<p>"I used to have some wonderful times with my <lb/>
class," she tells us. "I made them pray, and I am <lb/>
<pb n="135" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0146"/>
sure that anybody coming into one of those meetings <lb/>
would have seen very much what a Salvation Army <lb/>
consecration meeting is now. They usually all <lb/>
stopped, and sometimes our prayer-meetings would <lb/>
last an hour and a half. Often I went on till I lost <lb/>
my voice, not regaining it for a day or two after. <lb/>
I used to invite them to talk to me privately, if <reg orig="any-|thing">anything</reg> <lb/>
I said had struck them, and at such times they <lb/>
would pour out their hearts to me as if I had been <lb/>
their mother.</p>
<p>"However, I was a good deal disappointed with the <lb/>
Reformers. I had hoped that we were upon the eve <lb/>
of a great spiritual revival. Instead of this, <reg orig="every-|thing">everything</reg> <lb/>
was conducted very much in the ordinary style, <lb/>
and I soon became heartily sick of the spirit of debate <lb/>
and controversy which prevailed to such a degree as <lb/>
to cripple the life and power of the concern."</p>

<div2 type="chapter" n="III" id="d32">
<head><hi rend="bold">CHAPTER III. <lb/>
COURTSHIP, MARRIAGE, AND MATERNITY.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">It</hi> was in the autumn of 1851 that amongst the <lb/>
local preachers chosen to fill in turn the pulpit of <lb/>
the Reformers' Chapel which Miss Mumford and her <lb/>
mother now attended, occurred the name of a certain <lb/>
Mr. William Booth.</p>
<p>This young man, who, reared in the Church of <lb/>
England, had received his first definite religious <reg orig="im-|pressions">impressions</reg> <lb/>
at a Wesleyan Chapel, had from boyhood <lb/>
been in the habit of holding cottage meetings and <lb/>
visiting the sick and dying. He also delighted in <lb/>
<pb n="136" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0147"/>
assisting at open-air services, the object of which was <lb/>
to draw the unthinking to attendance at Divine <lb/>
worship.</p>
<p>Mr. Booth's great desire was to be a preacher, and <lb/>
he offered himself for that purpose to the Wesleyan <lb/>
Connexion, but was rather coldly received.</p>
<p>He then devoted his overflowing energies to <reg orig="open-|air">open-air</reg> <lb/>
work in the streets and greens of Kennington, but <lb/>
although he had, so far, held himself aloof from the <lb/>
Reformers, he became suspected by the minister in <lb/>
charge of his circuit with being tained with their <lb/>
heresy, and, like Catherine Mumford, but with less <lb/>
justification, he too was summarily expelled.</p>
<p>As soon, however, as the Reformers heard of this, <lb/>
they cordially invited him to join their ranks; he <lb/>
acceded to their request, and thus found himself in <lb/>
the pulpit of Binfield House Chapel.</p>
<p>Miss Mumford was present on the occasion that he <lb/>
preached, and was very much impressed with both <lb/>
Mr. Booth and his sermon.</p>
<p>Asked her opinion of the latter a few days later by <lb/>
Mr. Rabbits, one of the leading men connected with <lb/>
the chapel, she replied that she considered it the best <lb/>
sermon she had yet heard at Binfield Hall.</p>
<p>Shortly afterwards Mr. Rabbits invited the principal <lb/>
Reformers of that district to tea at his house, and <lb/>
social intercourse. Mrs. and Miss Mumford were <lb/>
among the guests, and also William Booth.</p>
<p>The latter, who was a clever elocutionist, was <lb/>
pressed, in the course of the evening, to give a striking <lb/>
temperance recitation, entitled "The Grog Seller's <lb/>
Dream." This in its turn gave rise to conversation <lb/>
on the subject of Total Abstinence, drawing from <lb/>
<pb n="137" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0148"/>
Miss Mumford some convincing expressions of her <lb/>
own strong views in favour of the movement, and <lb/>
revealing the fact that on some important points she <lb/>
and the young preacher were wholly in sympathy.</p>
<p>Early in 1852, William Booth relinquished business <lb/>
and gave himself up wholly to the work of the <lb/>
ministry. The Reformers had appointed him their <lb/>
pastor, and he commenced his labours on a salary of <lb/>
fifty pounds a-year.</p>
<p>The acquaintance between him and Catherine <lb/>
Mumford soon developed into friendship, which ere <lb/>
long ripened into a warmer feeling on both sides. <lb/>
But realising that his position and income were <lb/>
somewhat insecure, Mr. Booth shrank for some time <lb/>
from asking the young lady to enter into a definite <lb/>
engagement.</p>
<p>Catherine, on her part, behaved as unselfishly and <lb/>
disinterestedly as did her lover, begging him only to <lb/>
make sure that every step he took was in accordance <lb/>
with the will of God.</p>
<p>But in May of that year both were eventually <lb/>
brought to see that it would be with the blessing of <lb/>
God and for the furtherance of His work that two <lb/>
whose deepest longings and dearest aims were <reg orig="identi-|cal">identical</reg>, <lb/>
should become one; and the betrothal was <lb/>
sealed.</p>
<p>The love-letters that were subsequently exchanged <lb/>
between this remarkable couple are as far removed <lb/>
from earthliness&mdash;those of the young lady especially <lb/>
so&mdash;as were the minds and aspirations of the writers.</p>
<p>Not many recently-engaged girls, we venture to <lb/>
think, would write to her beloved in such a strain as <lb/>
this:&mdash;</p>
<pb n="138" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0149"/>
<p>"<hi rend="small-caps">My Dear William</hi>,&mdash;I ought to be happy after <lb/>
enjoying your company all the evening, but now <lb/>
you are gone and I am alone, I feel a regret consonant <lb/>
with the height of my enjoyment. How wide the <lb/>
difference between heavenly and earthly joys! The <lb/>
former satiate the soul and reproduce themselves. <lb/>
The latter, after planting in our soul the seeds of <lb/>
future griefs and cares, take their flight and leave an <lb/>
aching void.</p>
<p>"How wisely God has apportioned our cup! He <lb/>
does not give us all sweetness, lest we should rest <lb/>
satisfied with earth; nor all bitterness, lest we grow <lb/>
weary and disgusted with our lot. But He wisely <lb/>
mixes the two, so that if we drink the one, we must also <lb/>
taste the other. And perhaps a time is coming when <lb/>
we shall see that the proportions of this cup of human <lb/>
joy and sorrow are more equally adjusted than we <lb/>
now imagine&mdash;that souls capable of enjoyments above <lb/>
the vulgar crowd can also feel sorrow, in comparison <lb/>
with which theirs is but like the passing April cloud <lb/>
in contrast with the long Egyptian night.</p>
<p>"How wise an ordination this is we cannot now <lb/>
discover. It will require the light which streams from <lb/>
the Eternal Throne to reveal to us the blessed effects <lb/>
of having the sentence of death written on all our <lb/>
earthly enjoyments. I often anticipate the glorious <lb/>
employment of investigating the mysterious workings <lb/>
of Divine Providence. Oh, may it be our happy lot <lb/>
to assist each other in these heavenly researches in <lb/>
that pure, bright world above!"</p>
<p>After this, it is almost refreshing to find one record <lb/>
of natural girlishness. In later life Mrs. Booth <reg orig="con-|fessed">confessed</reg> <lb/>
that "I had, like most people, certain <reg orig="prefer-|ences">preferences</reg>. <lb/>
<pb n="139" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0150"/>
The first was that the object of my choice <lb/>
should be a minister. &hellip; Then I very much desired <lb/>
that he should be dark and tall, and had a special <lb/>
liking for the name of 'William.' Singularly enough, <lb/>
in adhering to my essentials, my fancies were also <lb/>
gratified, and in my case the promise was certainly <lb/>
fulfilled, 'Delight thyself in the Lord, and He shall <lb/>
give thee the desires of thy heart.'"</p>
<p>Mrs. Booth's views on the subject of courtship and <lb/>
marriage, formulated when the force of her strong <lb/>
character in its maturity had burst the bonds of that <lb/>
stilted religiosity of language which, to some minds, <lb/>
may mar the compositions of her early years, are so <lb/>
wise and practical that they may well be quoted <lb/>
here; would that we had space to give her words <lb/>
in full.</p>
<p>"Who can wonder," she remarks, "that marriage <lb/>
is so often a failure, when we observe the ridiculous <lb/>
way in which courtship is commonly carried on? &hellip;</p>
<p>"Perhaps the greatest evil of all is <hi rend="italic">hurry</hi>. Young <lb/>
people do not give themselves time to know each <lb/>
other before an engagement is formed. They should <lb/>
take time and make opportunities for acquainting <lb/>
themselves with each other's character, disposition, <lb/>
and peculiarities before coming to a decision. &hellip;</p>
<p>"As quite a young girl I early made up my mind <lb/>
to certain qualifications which I regarded as <reg orig="indis-|pensable">indispensable</reg> <lb/>
to the forming of any engagement.</p>
<p>"In the first place I was determined that his <lb/>
religious views <hi rend="italic">must</hi> coincide with mine. He must <lb/>
be a sincere Christian, not a nominal one, or a mere <lb/>
Church member, but truly converted to God. &hellip; <lb/>
Thousands of Christians, women especially, have <lb/>
<pb n="140" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0151"/>
proved by bitter experience that neither money, <lb/>
position, nor any other worldly advantage has availed <lb/>
to prevent the punishment that invariably attends <lb/>
disobedience to the command, 'Be not unequally <lb/>
yoked together with unbelievers.'</p>
<p>"The second essential that I resolved upon was that <lb/>
he should be a man of sense. I knew that I could <lb/>
never respect a fool, or one much weaker mentally <lb/>
than myself. &hellip; There ought to be similarity or <lb/>
congeniality of <hi rend="italic">character</hi> as well as of grace. &hellip;</p>
<p>"The third essential consisted of oneness of views <lb/>
and tastes, any idea of lordship or ownership being <lb/>
lost in love. &hellip; Of course, there must and will be <lb/>
mutual yielding where there is proper love, because <lb/>
it is a pleasure and a joy to yield our own wills to <lb/>
those for whom we have real affection, whenever it <lb/>
can be done with an approving conscience. &hellip;</p>
<p>"Another resolution I made was that I would <lb/>
never marry a man who was not a total abstainer, <lb/>
and this from conviction, and not merely in order <lb/>
to gratify me."</p>
<p>Having, therefore, been so happy as to find her <lb/>
every requirement fulfilled in the man who loved <lb/>
her, Catherine Mumford, on the 16th of June, 1855, <lb/>
became Mrs. William Booth.</p>
<p>Her bridegroom, who for some months previously <lb/>
had been conducting evangelistic services in various <lb/>
parts of the country with marked success, was now <lb/>
appointed by the Annual Conference of the New <lb/>
Connexion to the permanent work of itinerant <lb/>
missions, or "revivals," as they were formerly called.</p>
<p>It was a keen disappointment to both that <lb/>
Catherine's health, always delicate, forbade her at <lb/>
<pb n="141" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0152"/>
first to accompany Mr. Booth on these journeys, and <lb/>
the letters which passed between them while separated <lb/>
were of a tenderly affectionate tone. Very soon, <lb/>
however, she was able to join him, and an extract <lb/>
or two from a letter she wrote to him during a brief <lb/>
absence shortly after, indicates that her nature was <lb/>
already expanding in the sunshine of love and joy, <lb/>
and coming out of its chrysalis bondage like a <reg orig="butter-|fly">butterfly</reg> <lb/>
in spring.</p>
<p>"Here I sit under a hedge in the beautiful lane <lb/>
you pointed out to me. It is one of the loveliest days <lb/>
old earth has ever basked in. &hellip; All Nature seems <lb/>
to be exulting in existence, and your moralising little <lb/>
wife is much better in health and in a mood to enjoy <lb/>
all these beauties and advantages to the utmost. &hellip; <lb/>
I feel perfectly at home here, and experience just <lb/>
that free, sweet, wholesome kind of atmosphere which <lb/>
I have so long been panting for. My natural spirits <lb/>
are in a high key this morning. I feel as if I could <lb/>
get over a stile just at hand and join the lambs in <lb/>
their gambols."&lpar;!&rpar;</p>
<p>For nearly a year this truly happy and united <lb/>
pair travelled from town to town together, one in <lb/>
heart, in work, in all their hopes and joys. Many <lb/>
converts were gathered in, and the constant testimony <lb/>
of husband and wife was to ever-increasing love for <lb/>
and delight in each other.</p>
<p>A visit to Halifax in March, 1856, was prolonged <lb/>
by the arrival of "a plump, round-faced, dark-<reg orig="com-|plexioned">complexioned</reg>, <lb/>
black-pated" little person, since known to <lb/>
the world as William Bramwell Booth, Chief of the <lb/>
Staff of the Salvation Army.</p>
<p>Concerning her first-born son, Mrs. Booth writes:&mdash; <lb/>
<pb n="142" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0153"/>
"I held him up to God as soon as I had strength to <lb/>
do so, and I remember specially desiring that he <lb/>
should be an advocate of holiness. &hellip; At an early <lb/>
age he manifested signs of intelligence and ability. <lb/>
He resembled me especially in one particular, that <lb/>
was in taking upon himself responsibility. He was <lb/>
very conscientious too. &hellip; I cannot remember his <lb/>
ever telling me a falsehood. &hellip; His energy as a child <lb/>
was something marvellous."</p>
<p>Shortly after this event, Mr. Booth, at the wish of <lb/>
the Conference, was induced for a while to relinquish <lb/>
evangelistic work, and settle down in a circuit. <lb/>
Brighouse in Yorkshire was the appointed scene of <lb/>
his labours, and here the family remained about a <lb/>
year. It was at Brighouse that their second son, <lb/>
Ballington, was born. This was almost the only <lb/>
pleasant event of that period, as Mr. Booth felt that <lb/>
he had been unfairly dealt with by the Conference, <lb/>
and that his special talent was being stifled. And <lb/>
we need not say that his wife fully shared all his <lb/>
views.</p>
<p>In May, 1858, William Booth received the rite of <lb/>
ordination, and the consequent privilege of what is <lb/>
termed "full connexion;" and although still hoping <lb/>
and longing to return to the more congenial <reg orig="evangel-|istic">evangelistic</reg> <lb/>
sphere, he consented to another year's circuit <lb/>
work, this time at Gateshead.</p>
<p>Here the enthusiastic pair found themselves in <lb/>
happier conditions. The very first Sunday night <lb/>
they were there "six persons professed salvation, and <lb/>
the occasion was made the more interesting by what <lb/>
was then an unheard of novelty, the minister's wife <lb/>
leading off in prayer at the conclusion of the sermon," <lb/>
<pb n="143" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0154"/>
which appears to have been Mrs. Booth's first <reg orig="appear-|ance">appearance</reg> <lb/>
in anything like a ministerial capacity in public.</p>
<p>Before long, the new pastor was drawing crowded <lb/>
congregations, and the chapel had gained the <reg orig="sobri-|quet">sobriquet</reg> <lb/>
of the "Converting Shop." It was here that he <lb/>
first began to gain influence over the masses.</p>
<p>At Gateshead, in September, 1858, the Booths' first <lb/>
little daughter, Catherine, was born. She is now Mrs. <lb/>
Booth-Clibborn, otherwise the "Mar&eacute;chale."</p>
<p>Some very successful "revival" work was done at <lb/>
Gateshead, the methods of Mr. Booth as time went on <lb/>
inclining more and more to the since well-known <lb/>
"Salvation" type, "all-day prayer meetings," open air <lb/>
processions, etc., being inaugurated. It was here also <lb/>
that Mrs. Booth first gained courage to visit the poor <lb/>
in their own homes, and urge them to attend the <lb/>
mission services, and she was especially blessed in her <lb/>
endeavours to reclaim drunkards. When the <reg orig="stipu-|lated">stipulated</reg> <lb/>
twelve months at Gateshead had expired, <lb/>
Mr. Booth was again persuaded to stay on as a <lb/>
circuit minister instead of returning to his loved <lb/>
work of itinerant evangelist.</p>
<p>In December, 1859, Mrs. Booth's attention was <lb/>
drawn to a pamphlet written by a Mr. Rees, attacking <lb/>
on Scriptural grounds the right of women to preach. <lb/>
The exciting cause of this publication being the visit <lb/>
of an American evangelist and his wife, Dr. and <lb/>
Mrs. Palmer, the latter of whom took the more <lb/>
prominent part in the meetings. Mrs. Booth was <lb/>
highly indignant at this opposition, and was moved <lb/>
to write a powerful and convincing pamphlet in reply.</p>
<p>This was the commencement of the life-long <reg orig="war-|fare">warfare</reg> <lb/>
which she subsequently waged against the <reg orig="con-|ventionality">conventionality</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="144" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0155"/>
that would forbid women the opportunity <lb/>
of teaching in the church.</p>
<p>A good deal of interesting correspondence with <lb/>
various people was evoked by the publication of <lb/>
Mrs. Booth's protest, but it was not until after the <lb/>
birth of her fourth child, Emma Moss Booth &lpar;Mrs. <lb/>
Booth-Tucker&rpar; that she was able to champion in her <lb/>
own person and by her example, the right of women <lb/>
to speak as the Spirit gives them utterance.</p>

THE MOTHER OF THE SALVATION ARMY.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">It</hi> was in the spring of 1860 that Mrs. Booth made <lb/>
her first appearance in her husband's pulpit.</p>
<p>Although she had for months been exercised in <lb/>
mind on the subject, her action at last, after much <lb/>
inward conflict and reluctance, was unpremeditated.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of one of Mr. Booth's services, she <lb/>
suddenly rose, walked up the aisle, and told her <lb/>
husband she wanted "to say a word."</p>
<p>Overcome by surprise and pleasure&mdash;for this was <lb/>
what he had long been vainly trying to persuade her <lb/>
to do&mdash;Mr. Booth could only say, "My dear wife <lb/>
wishes to speak," and then sat down.</p>
<p>Then Mrs. Booth "just stood and told the people <lb/>
how it had come about." She said she realised that <lb/>
she had long, by her silence, been disobeying God, <lb/>
and was resolved to do so no more.</p>
<p>The congregation were deeply affected; "many <lb/>
dated a renewal in righteousness from that very <lb/>
<pb n="145" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0156"/>
moment, and began a life of devotion and <reg orig="consecra-|tion">consecration</reg> <lb/>
to God."</p>
<p>Yielding to her husband's entreaties, Mrs. Booth <lb/>
consented, on the evening of the same day, to preach <lb/>
a regular sermon.</p>
<p>Her text on this memorable occasion was, "Be filled <lb/>
with the Spirit." The chapel was crowded to the <lb/>
very window sills, and much blessing was received.</p>
<p>From this time forward Mrs. Booth's fame as a <lb/>
preacher continued to spread far and wide. During <lb/>
her husband's enforced absence for rest in September <lb/>
of that same year, she undertook all his most <reg orig="import-|ant">important</reg> <lb/>
services, and her letters of that period speak <lb/>
enthusiastically of full congregations, blessed times, <lb/>
and encouraging cases of conversion.</p>
<p>The following year the subject of personal holiness <lb/>
was much borne in upon Mrs. Booth's mind, and <lb/>
became a marked feature of her subsequent teachings. <lb/>
In this connection one cannot but express the regret <lb/>
which is called forth repeatedly during the writing of <lb/>
this memoir, that the fervid intensity of Mrs. Booth's <lb/>
religious convictions should not have escaped the <lb/>
narrowness and intolerance which too often mars <lb/>
piety of this type. Her sweeping condemnation of all <lb/>
who did not think it necessary to advertise their <lb/>
Christian profession by startling peculiarities in dress, <lb/>
and her wholesale charges of coldness, hardness and <lb/>
formality against those whose joy and peace in <reg orig="believ-|ing">believing</reg> <lb/>
were unaccompanied by moral earthquakes and <lb/>
tornadoes, were certainly "flies in the ointment" of <lb/>
an otherwise admirable character.</p>
<p>The Booths remained at Gateshead until 1861, when, <lb/>
after much controversy with the Conference, into <lb/>
<pb n="146" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0157"/>
which we have not space to enter here, Mr. Booth <lb/>
finally tendered his resignation and gave himself up <lb/>
to the revival work which was at once his delight and <lb/>
his <foreign lang="ita"><hi rend="italic">forte</hi>.</foreign></p>
<p>From that time forward, the conducting of missions <lb/>
in various parts of the country became the life-work <lb/>
of this devoted pair. Cornwall, Cardiff, Walsall, <lb/>
Birmingham, and other places became in turn the <lb/>
scene of their united efforts, and everywhere we find <lb/>
the same record of "blessed seasons," "great liberty <lb/>
of speech," weeping penitents and rejoicing converts. <lb/>
Herbert Booth, the future musician of the Salvation <lb/>
Army, was born at Penzance in 1862.</p>
<p>At Walsall Mrs. Booth experienced the joy of <lb/>
receiving her own son, Bramwell, aged about eight, at <lb/>
the juvenile penitent form. About a year previously <lb/>
he had definitely refused the offer of salvation, so the <lb/>
mother's thankfulness was now proportionately great.</p>
<p>In May, 1864, the sixth child, Marian, was born, <lb/>
the first who seems in any way to have inherited that <lb/>
delicate physical health against which Mrs. Booth's <lb/>
dauntless spirit was doomed so continually to <lb/>
struggle.</p>
<p>It was after her recovery from this illness that the <lb/>
woman-evangelist first decided to conduct meetings <lb/>
unassisted by her husband, and thus double their <lb/>
power for good.</p>
<p>At Batley, Pudsey, and Woodhouse Carr she <reg orig="con-|ducted">conducted</reg> <lb/>
revival services with great success. At one of <lb/>
these places in the course of <hi rend="italic">six days</hi>, over <hi rend="italic">one hundred <lb/>
adults</hi> and <hi rend="italic">two hundred children</hi> came forward as <lb/>
penitents to the communion rail.</p>
<p>In 1865, Mr. and Mrs. Booth took up their abode <lb/>
<pb n="147" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0158"/>
in London, and here, in a marquee in the Quaker <lb/>
burial-ground at Whitechapel, the great Salvation <lb/>
Army may be said to have had its birth.</p>
<p>Into this big tent were gathered, night after night, <lb/>
the poorest and vilest of the outcasts of the great city, <lb/>
and at meeting after meeting tears of penitence were <lb/>
shed, and new lives begun. But while William Booth <lb/>
felt his sympathies go out especially to those of the <lb/>
most wretched classes, his wife's ministry seemed <lb/>
peculiarly acceptable to those of superior social <lb/>
position, and even when she spoke most plainly <lb/>
respecting society sins, denouncing the selfishness of <lb/>
fashion, the cruelty of stag-hunting, or the brutality <lb/>
of war in scathing terms, the long line of carriages <lb/>
waiting outside the hall in which her addresses were <lb/>
delivered, testified that her frankness attracted rather <lb/>
than repelled those whom she was desirous to <reg orig="influ-|ence">influence</reg>. <lb/>
As her biographer remarks, "it was a singular <lb/>
coincidence that at the very time when Mr. Booth was <lb/>
commencing his East End campaign, Mrs. Booth was <lb/>
conducting her first West End services, so that the <lb/>
very antipodes of London society were simultaneously <lb/>
assailed." And Mrs. Booth's impassioned appeals to <lb/>
the rich were often the means of obtaining money <lb/>
wherewith to continue the evangelising work among <lb/>
the poor. Surely no husband and wife were ever <lb/>
more truly united, or exemplified more beautifully <lb/>
the law of mutual complement than did William and <lb/>
Catherine Booth!</p>
<p>Ultimately "the General," as we must now call <lb/>
him, decided to abandon itinerant mission work, and <lb/>
devote himself wholly to the East End poor. In this <lb/>
determination he met with a staunch ally and <reg orig="gener-|ous">generous</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="148" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0159"/>
supporter in Mr. Samuel Morley, M.P., who once <lb/>
described himself at a Salvation Army meeting as a <lb/>
"sleeping partner" in the concern.</p>
<p>When the tent in the burial-ground was blown <lb/>
down in a gale, a dancing saloon was secured, in <lb/>
which the services could be held; and the East <lb/>
London Mission, as for a time it was called, grew and <lb/>
flourished.</p>
<p>On Christmas Day, 1865, a seventh child &lpar;being the <lb/>
fourth daughter&rpar; was added to the Booth family, and <lb/>
received the appropriate name of Evangeline.</p>
<p>Again and again was Mrs. Booth prostrated by <lb/>
weakness and maladies of various forms, and as often, <lb/>
in answer to fervent prayer, was she restored to <reg orig="com-|parative">comparative</reg> <lb/>
health and the ability to continue her work. <lb/>
But her whole life was a chronic martyrdom of bodily <lb/>
suffering, such as only the strongest spirit, upborne <lb/>
by a constant sense of Divine help, could have <reg orig="sus-|tained">sustained</reg>.</p>
<p>On the 28th of April, 1867, was born the eighth and <lb/>
last child, another girl, who was named Lucy Milward. <lb/>
Like her sister, Marian, she has been of a delicate <lb/>
constitution, and while others worked and fought, it <lb/>
has been her lot to be among those who "also serve," <lb/>
though they may only "stand and wait."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the older children were all following in <lb/>
the steps of their father and mother, holding little <lb/>
meetings among themselves and their young <reg orig="com-|panions">companions</reg> <lb/>
at a very early age. Their letters to their <lb/>
parents on various occasions of separation teem with <lb/>
expressions of religious fervour, and record efforts <lb/>
made for the spiritual enlightenment and moral <lb/>
restoration of those with whom they were thrown <lb/>
<pb n="149" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0160"/>
Their self-examination and contemplation also <lb/>
resembled that of their mother in her youth, and their <lb/>
fluctuations of religious feeling were carefully noted <lb/>
down at an age when most children are absorbed in <lb/>
their lessons and play. This complete reproduction, <lb/>
in each and all, of the parental characteristics, was <lb/>
probably the result of Mrs. Booth's carefulness in <lb/>
keeping them as much as possible from any <reg orig="associa-|tion">association</reg> <lb/>
with persons, either old or young, of a different <lb/>
type, until her own views were stamped indelibly upon <lb/>
their plastic souls.</p>
<p>Ever busy as Mrs. Booth always was with her <reg orig="im-|portant">important</reg> <lb/>
mission of converting the lost, she never <lb/>
allowed that to betray her into neglect of nearer <lb/>
duties. Her children's welfare, both bodily and <lb/>
spiritual, was her constant care. She prayed and <lb/>
laboured that they might be true Christians and <lb/>
earnestly devoted to the work of saving souls; the <lb/>
remarkable manner in which this, her dearest wish, <lb/>
has been fulfilled, is sufficient evidence that she <lb/>
sought its furtherance in the best way.</p>
<p>Complete severance from what she regarded as <lb/>
"the world," was ever a cardinal point in Mrs. Booth's <lb/>
principles, and she naturally enforced it upon her <lb/>
family, as it was afterwards made a leading feature <lb/>
in the discipline of the Salvation Army. Even the <lb/>
beautiful frocks, etc., which the children's <reg orig="grand-|mother">grandmother</reg> <lb/>
made for them with her own hands, were <lb/>
stripped of all superfluous ornamentation before they <lb/>
were permitted to be worn.</p>
<p>In December, 1869, Mrs. Booth experienced a heavy <lb/>
sorrow in the death of Mrs. Mumford, after a period <lb/>
of intense suffering. The devoted daughter had <reg orig="per-|suaded">persuaded</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="150" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0161"/>
her mother some months earlier, when it was <lb/>
known that the disease which had attacked the latter <lb/>
must be fatal, to come up to London and live near her, <lb/>
so the two had the mutual comfort of being together <lb/>
when the end came, and Mrs. Mumford's happy and <lb/>
glorious departure was the greatest possible solace <lb/>
to Mrs. Booth.</p>
<p>In 1870, the People's Market in Whitechapel Road <lb/>
was purchased, and here "<hi rend="italic">All-Nights of Prayer</hi>" were <lb/>
first conducted by Mrs. Booth; and here also the <lb/>
East London Mission tried its earliest experiment in <lb/>
the sale of cheap food to the poor.</p>
<p>In 1872, the General broke down under the strain <lb/>
of his prolonged exertions, and was completely laid <lb/>
aside for six months. During his illness and <reg orig="en-|forced">enforced</reg> <lb/>
absence, Mrs. Booth managed the affairs of <lb/>
the Mission with ability and success. On the return <lb/>
of her husband she arranged what proved to be one <lb/>
of the most successful campaigns she ever undertook <lb/>
&mdash;that of Portsmouth, in 1873.</p>
<p>She engaged a music hall in the lowest part of <lb/>
the town and gathered immense crowds of soldiers <lb/>
and sailors, their companions, and "the worst and <lb/>
most Gospel-needy classes in the town." The services <lb/>
lasted seventeen weeks, and the names of six hundred <lb/>
converts were taken. The morning meetings on this <lb/>
memorable occasion were devoted to professing <lb/>
Christians, and for twelve consecutive Sundays <lb/>
Mrs. Booth based her addresses upon the one text, <lb/>
"Go work to-day in My vineyard!" She spoke for <lb/>
about an hour each time, and so far from exhausting <lb/>
her subject, could only promise her hearers that she <lb/>
would resume it on the following Sunday, but <lb/>
<pb entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0162"/>
<figure id="f29" rend="page" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0162">

<pb entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0163"/>
<pb n="153" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0164"/>
whether to conclude or not was more than she <lb/>
could tell!</p>
<p>In 1874, Mrs. Booth became deeply interested in <lb/>
the American Whisky War, and the result was the <lb/>
inauguration by the Mission of a Drunkards' Rescue <lb/>
Brigade, which from the first was "signally blessed <lb/>
in reaching and reclaiming many of the most forlorn <lb/>
and degraded of this class."</p>
<p>In 1875, we find Mrs. Booth suffering acutely from <lb/>
her second attack of <hi rend="italic">angina pectoris</hi>. For several <lb/>
weeks she was confined to her room, her symptoms <lb/>
at times being most agonising and alarming. <reg orig="Hydro-|pathy">Hydropathy</reg> <lb/>
was, however, on this occasion, resorted to, <lb/>
and with such happy effects that, after a period of <lb/>
rest, she became able to continue her beloved work <lb/>
once more.</p>
<p>The following years were especially marked by <lb/>
the appearance of several of the young Booths in <lb/>
public as assistants in their parents' work. As <lb/>
early as 1870, indeed, Bramwell, then a lad of only <lb/>
fourteen, had commenced to address adult <reg orig="congre-|gations">congregations</reg>, <lb/>
both indoors and in the open air. Shortly <lb/>
after, Catherine followed her brother's example, and <lb/>
she, too, was scarcely more than a child when she <lb/>
first spoke to an audience in the street. Emma <lb/>
commenced in 1877, and the others, one by one, <lb/>
joined the ranks of preachers in the Mission at an <lb/>
astonishingly tender age.</p>
<p>It was not until the Christmas of this year &lpar;1877&rpar;, <lb/>
that the Mission was called by its afterwards <reg orig="world-|famed">world-famed</reg> <lb/>
name of "The Salvation Army." This was <lb/>
Mr. Booth's own idea, and it was used first on his <lb/>
annual printed appeal for help.</p>
<pb n="154" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0165"/>
<p>The military notion once started, it was found so <lb/>
singularly suitable to the work in many ways, that <lb/>
"Captains," "Colonels," and "Corps," soon followed. <lb/>
A flag was designed, of which the blue border <lb/>
symbolised holiness, the scarlet ground typified <reg orig="salva-|tion">salvation</reg> <lb/>
by the blood of Christ, and the yellow star in <lb/>
the centre betokened the baptism of the Holy Ghost. <lb/>
Similarly, the motto of the Army, "Blood and Fire," <lb/>
represents salvation and the fire of the Spirit. It <lb/>
was an easy and natural thing that the title of <lb/>
"General Superintendent of the Mission," which <lb/>
Mr. Booth had long borne, should be shortened into <lb/>
simply "The General," and with, finally, a uniform <lb/>
designed by Mrs. Booth, in accordance with her <lb/>
ambition to look, as well as be, totally unlike "the <lb/>
world," the army scheme was complete.</p>
<p>After this, the annals of the services teem with <reg orig="ex-|periences">experiences</reg> <lb/>
of "bombardments" accomplished, "<reg orig="strong-|holds">strongholds</reg>" <lb/>
taken, and "battles" won. The poorest, the <lb/>
most ignorant, and the most degraded were reached <lb/>
and touched as had never been known before, and <lb/>
such characters as "Happy Eliza," "The Converted <lb/>
Sweep," and the "Hallelujah Giant," were <reg orig="con-|vincing">convincing</reg> <lb/>
evidences of the reality of the victories <lb/>
gained.</p>
<p>In 1880 the <hi rend="italic">War Cry</hi> was launched, and although <lb/>
by this and other literary work the General and his <lb/>
wife might have attained a position of affluence, they <lb/>
chose rather to devote the proceeds of the successful <lb/>
enterprise to the extension of their work.</p>
<p>Limitations of space compel us to pass over much <lb/>
that is deeply interesting in the record of succeeding <lb/>
years. Confining ourselves, of necessity, to a sketch <lb/>
<pb n="155" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0166"/>
of the life of Catherine Booth only, we must <reg orig="reluc-|tantly">reluctantly</reg> <lb/>
omit all reference to the many thrilling episodes <lb/>
in the careers and triumphs of her children, and pass <lb/>
over in silence the names of many noteworthy and <lb/>
influential friends of the Army.</p>
<p>In 1882, the work was carried into India, Sweden <lb/>
and Canada, as in the previous year Miss Booth and <lb/>
her band of soldiers had invaded France on their <reg orig="cam-|paign">campaign</reg> <lb/>
of peace.</p>
<p>The year 1882 was also marked by the marriage of <lb/>
Mrs. Booth's eldest son, Bramwell, to a young lady <lb/>
enthusiastically devoted to the work.</p>
<p>In 1885, the Booths were participators with Mrs. <lb/>
Josephine Butler, Mr. Stead, and others, in the famous <lb/>
Purity Agitation, and were instrumental in bringing <lb/>
about the passing of the much-needed Criminal Law <lb/>
Amendment Act. They also shared in the penalties <lb/>
which followed upon Mr. Stead's bold action in the <lb/>
matter, but emerged safe and triumphant from <lb/>
all their trials, and with increased desires to <lb/>
guard and befriend the unprotected young girls <lb/>
of London.</p>
<p>It was in this year also that <hi rend="italic">All the World</hi> was <lb/>
first published, a magazine which sought to address <lb/>
those to whom the rough-and-ready style of the <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">War Cry</hi> was hardly acceptable.</p>
<p>Mrs. Booth, once more prostrated by illness, now <lb/>
utilised her enforced leisure in writing letters to the <lb/>
latter paper on different subjects suggested by the <lb/>
difficulties of private correspondents, who sought her <lb/>
counsel from all parts of the world. The answer to a <lb/>
father who was in despair concerning the conduct of <lb/>
his grown-up sons, that to a young lady, uneasy about <lb/>
<pb n="156" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0167"/>
her intended marriage to an unconverted lover, and <lb/>
another, embodying Mrs. Booth's views on the subject <lb/>
of spiritualism, may be mentioned as indicating the <lb/>
variety and scope of the topics with which she so ably <lb/>
and sensibly dealt. Our only regret is that we <reg orig="can-|not">cannot</reg> <lb/>
reproduce some of these wise essays in full.</p>
<p>But we must pass on to the closing activities of this <lb/>
remarkable life.</p>
<p>During the latter half of 1886 and the whole of <lb/>
1887, Mrs. Booth not only held crowded meetings in <lb/>
Exeter Hall, and most of the large Salvation Army <lb/>
halls in London, but visited nearly twenty provincial <lb/>
towns in all parts of England. Her denunciations of <lb/>
evil grew stronger and more severe as she realised <lb/>
with greater intensity the need of plain speaking <lb/>
with regard to sin. Nevertheless, her popularity <lb/>
did not undergo the slightest diminution, and at this <lb/>
period it may be said that as a preacher she was in <lb/>
the zenith of her success.</p>
<p>Between the years 1886 and 1890, four more of <lb/>
Mrs. Booth's children were happily and suitably <lb/>
wedded, the chosen partner in each case being <lb/>
one whose whole heart was in the work of the <lb/>
Army.</p>
<p>In 1886, Commander Ballington Booth was married <lb/>
to Miss Maud Charlesworth; in 1887 the Mar&eacute;chale <lb/>
gave her hand to Commissioner Booth-Clibborn; in <lb/>
1888 Miss Emma Booth became Mrs. <reg orig="Booth-|Tucker">Booth-Tucker</reg>, <lb/>
and the last of the four was Commandant <lb/>
Herbert Booth, who was united to Miss Coraline <lb/>
Schoch.</p>
<p>It is a sad transition from the wedding-feast to the <lb/>
chamber of death! But even at the time that this <lb/>
<pb n="157" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0168"/>
last wedding took place, Mrs. Booth's family realised <lb/>
with anguish that her days on earth were numbered, <lb/>
and she was already too ill to be present at the <lb/>
ceremony.</p>
<p>On the 21st of June, 1888, the great woman-<reg orig="evan-|gelist">evangelist</reg> <lb/>
gave her last public address, and the scene of <lb/>
this farewell utterance was the City Temple.</p>
<p>On this occasion, all forgetful of her weakness in <lb/>
her enthusiasm for the souls of those who listened, <lb/>
Mrs. Booth spoke for upwards of an hour, but so <reg orig="ex-|hausted">exhausted</reg> <lb/>
was she at the close that it was some <reg orig="con-|siderable">considerable</reg> <lb/>
time before she could be removed from the <lb/>
pulpit.</p>
<p>In the autumn of this year she stayed for a while <lb/>
at "Oceanville," Clacton-on-Sea&mdash;a house previously <lb/>
selected by her as a home of rest for the officers of <lb/>
the Army. But she received no permanent benefit <lb/>
from the visit. She liked the quiet of the place so <lb/>
much, however, that she returned in August, 1889, <lb/>
and remained there until her death.</p>
<p>After Mrs. Booth was incapacitated from work in <lb/>
public, and even, by the effect of the disease upon her <lb/>
right arm, unable any longer to write, she continued <lb/>
to dictate letters and advise with those who sought <lb/>
her help.</p>
<p>Her last message to the myriads who loved and <lb/>
honoured her, looking upon her as their spiritual <lb/>
mother, was unrolled before the eyes of the 20,000 <lb/>
persons who were gathered in the nave of the Crystal <lb/>
Palace at the anniversary celebration in 1890. It had <lb/>
been printed upon a wide strip of calico, in letters so <lb/>
large that it could be deciphered in all parts of the <lb/>
building, and ran as follows:&mdash;</p>
<pb n="158" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0169"/>
<p>"My dear Children and Friends,&mdash;My place is <lb/>
empty, but my heart is with you. You are my joy and <lb/>
my crown. Your battles, sufferings and victories have <lb/>
been the chief interests of my life these twenty-five <lb/>
years. They are so still. Go forward. Live holy <lb/>
lives. Be true to the Army. God is your strength. <lb/>
Love and seek the lost; bring them to the blood. <lb/>
<figure id="f30" rend="block" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0169">
<head>OCEANVILLE, CLACTON-ON-SEA.</head>
</figure>
Make the people good; inspire them with the Spirit <lb/>
of Jesus Christ. Love one another; help your <lb/>
comrades in dark hours. I am dying under the Army <lb/>
flag; it is yours to live and fight under. God is my <lb/>
salvation and refuge in the storm. I send you my <lb/>
love and blessing.&mdash;<hi rend="small-caps">Catherine Booth</hi>."</p>
<p>"The effect," we are told, "was electrical. The <lb/>
<pb n="159" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0170"/>
whole congregation was bathed in tears, and from <lb/>
thousands of hearts there went up fresh vows of <reg orig="con-|secration">consecration</reg> <lb/>
recorded in Heaven, and since fulfilled on <lb/>
earth."</p>
<p>On the 4th of October 1890, after having bidden <lb/>
most touching farewells to all her children and <reg orig="grand-|children">grandchildren</reg>, <lb/>
and many of the more prominent members <lb/>
<figure id="f31" rend="block" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0170">

<p>&lpar;<hi rend="italic">The Vacant Chair.</hi>&rpar;</p>
</figure>
of the Salvation Army, the grand, indomitable spirit <lb/>
of Catherine Booth was at length released from its <lb/>
tenement of pain. Her last audible words were, <lb/>
"<hi rend="italic">I see!</hi>"</p>
<p>One might fill pages with graphic descriptions of <lb/>
the "lying-in-state" at the Congress Hall, Clapton, <lb/>
when the body in a coffin with a glass panel was <lb/>
<pb n="160" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0171"/>
viewed by upwards of 40,000 persons, and of the <lb/>
funeral at Olympia, attended by 36,000, while <lb/>
thousands more were turned away for want of room. <lb/>
But our task is done; and we cannot better close <lb/>
this inadequate memoir than with two verses <lb/>
which aptly describe the feelings of those left <lb/>
behind:&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="stanza">

THE RICHEST WOMAN IN ENGLAND.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">There</hi> are few of us, I suppose, who have not at <lb/>
some time or other, generally in early youth, <lb/>
dreamed a pretty dream of what we would do were we <lb/>
suddenly to find ourselves possessed of great wealth; <lb/>
and thanks to the noble ideal and unselfish instincts <lb/>
with which, owing to centuries of Christianity, most of <lb/>
us begin life, this dream is usually full of the happiness <lb/>
and blessing we would scatter around us by means of <lb/>
our money. What sadness we would cheer, what <reg orig="suffer-|ing">suffering</reg> <lb/>
we would relieve, what good we would do wherever <lb/>
we went&mdash;if only we were rich!</p>
<p>To very few, however, comes any fulfilment of these <lb/>
bright imaginings; so it is never proved whether or not <lb/>
we should be the angels of comfort we have pictured to <lb/>
ourselves. On some, as history shows, the possession of <lb/>
<pb n="10" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0181"/>
wealth exerts a baleful influence, hardening the heart <lb/>
and strangely drying up the springs of sympathy; so <lb/>
perhaps it is safest that only a very small minority are <lb/>
ever subjected to its temptations. Meanwhile, we can <lb/>
go on building our luxurious <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italic">chateaux d'Espagne</hi></foreign> for the <lb/>
poor and needy, and rejoice that our ideal has been <lb/>
realised at least once in actual life, and to the utmost, <lb/>
by a lady of our own day&mdash;the universally honoured <lb/>
Baroness Burdett-Coutts.</p>
<p>Angela Georgina Burdett was born on April 21st, <lb/>
1814, and was the youngest daughter of Sir Francis <lb/>
Burdett, a leading Liberal politician of the reign of <lb/>
George the Third, and Sophia, his wife, the latter being <lb/>
a daughter of Mr. Thomas Coutts, the rich banker, who <lb/>
was founder of the well-known banking-house in the <lb/>
Strand.</p>
<p>From both her parents the subject of our present <lb/>
sketch appears to have inherited largeness of heart and <lb/>
kindliness of disposition towards the poor and oppressed. <lb/>
Sir Francis was the friend of the people and the <reg orig="cham-|pion">champion</reg> <lb/>
of the Reform Bill, his zeal in fighting for the <lb/>
rights of his fellow-countrymen resulting at one time in <lb/>
his arrest for "breach of privilege" and subsequent <reg orig="im-|prisonment">imprisonment</reg> <lb/>
in the Tower of London&mdash;the last captive <lb/>
that gloomy old pile ever held.</p>
<p>A room is still shown at the Baroness's town <reg orig="resi-|dence">residence</reg> <lb/>
in Stratton Street, the windows of which were <lb/>
broken in by the military, Sir Francis having protected <lb/>
the house with barricades. When at length he <reg orig="sur-|rendered">surrendered</reg>, <lb/>
his captors were pelted with stones by an <lb/>
angry crowd outside, who shouted "Burdett for ever!"</p>
<p>Sir Francis died on January 23rd, 1844, and Lady <lb/>
Burdett only a few days later. They were buried <reg orig="to-|gether">together</reg> <lb/>
at Ramsbury, in Wiltshire, the roads on the <lb/>
<pb n="11" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0182"/>
day of the double funeral being lined with sorrowing <lb/>
peasantry, to whom Sir Francis had been a good and <lb/>
generous landlord. He had been the idol of the people <lb/>
in London, and the memory of the kindness of both <lb/>
him and his wife is, we are told, still cherished and <lb/>
spoken of in the two counties where the large family <lb/>
estates are situated.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Miss Burdett's grandmother, the first Mrs. <lb/>
Coutts, had died, and the venerable banker, at the age <lb/>
of 84, was married a second time, to the handsome and <lb/>
fascinating actress, Miss Mellon.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding his advanced years, the old <reg orig="gentle-|man">gentleman</reg> <lb/>
must have been deeply in love with his charming <lb/>
young bride, for on his death it was discovered that <lb/>
he had left her the whole of his vast wealth, to the <lb/>
exclusion of his descendants by his first wife.</p>
<p>Doubtless much disappointment was felt by the <lb/>
younger branches of the family, whose chagrin must <lb/>
have been intensified when the widow subsequently <lb/>
married the Duke of St. Albans. Tradition has it&mdash; <lb/>
though we cannot say with what foundation of truth <lb/>
&mdash;that many were the attempts made at ingratiation <lb/>
with the wealthy Duchess, attempts in which one <reg orig="grand-|child">grandchild</reg>, <lb/>
Angela Burdett, was too proud or too <reg orig="noble-|minded">noble-minded</reg> <lb/>
to share.</p>
<p>However that may be, when, in 1837, the Duchess <lb/>
died, the surviving members of the Coutts family <reg orig="ex-|perienced">experienced</reg> <lb/>
another surprise, for the bulk of the old <lb/>
banker's property, supposed to be lost to the family <lb/>
for ever, was found to have been bequeathed to Miss <lb/>
Angela Burdett.</p>
<p>Thus, at the age of twenty-three, our heroine found <lb/>
herself, on the simple condition of taking the surname <lb/>
of Coutts, heiress of upwards of two million pounds <lb/>
<pb n="12" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0183"/>
sterling, or thirteen tons of English sovereigns. She <lb/>
was, the newly crowned Queen herself not excepted, <lb/>
the richest woman in England.</p>
<p>At once began to pour in upon the young millionairess <lb/>
congratulations, letters of good advice, begging petitions, <lb/>
and offers of marriage from all parts of the world.</p>
<p>One would-be suitor was not content with expressing <lb/>
his love &lpar;for the sovereigns!&rpar; in writing, but he <reg orig="person-|ally">personally</reg> <lb/>
followed her about, pestering her with his unwelcome <lb/>
attentions for no less than <hi rend="italic">fourteen years</hi>.</p>
<p>Wherever Miss Coutts went, this man&mdash;Dunn by <lb/>
name&mdash;pursued her; to the seaside, or the country, <lb/>
when she was walking or driving in town, says Miss <lb/>
Belloc in her interesting character sketch, he followed <lb/>
her like a shadow. The law in those days was not <lb/>
framed to interfere in such a case, and Miss Coutts's <lb/>
friends and relations, notwithstanding their efforts, <lb/>
proved powerless to put a stop to what must have been <lb/>
a truly painful persecution.</p>
<p>The climax was reached when Dunn, who was <lb/>
undoubtedly insane, walked one day into Coutts's bank <lb/>
and handed to a cashier a demand couched in doggerel <lb/>
verse for the modest sum of one hundred thousand <lb/>
pounds! This extraordinary behaviour resulted in an <lb/>
action being brought against him, in the course of <lb/>
which he committed perjury, was convicted, and sent <lb/>
to prison for five years. Then must have been a period <lb/>
of most welcome relief to the victimised heiress, and <lb/>
probably she hoped that during Mr. Dunn's enforced <lb/>
seclusion the ardour of his affection for herself might <lb/>
have time to cool.</p>
<p>But no such desirable effect ensued. As soon as <lb/>
the poor lunatic regained his liberty his pursuit of Miss <lb/>
Coutts commenced again with renewed vigour. She <lb/>
<pb n="13" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0184"/>
was only released from the torment when, fortunately <lb/>
for her, Dunn transferred his unappreciated attentions <lb/>
to a royal princess, when, his insanity being no longer <lb/>
doubted, he was placed under proper restraint.</p>
<p>So much for one of the inconveniences incidental <lb/>
to being known as the richest woman in England.</p>
<p>It is somewhat remarkable that our Queen's ascension <lb/>
to the throne and Miss Coutts's accession to her truly <lb/>
regal fortune should have occurred in the same year, <lb/>
the ever-famous eighteen hundred and thirty-seven. At <lb/>
the coronation of the girlish sovereign the young <lb/>
millionairess was a sufficiently conspicuous figure to <lb/>
be mentioned in the Ingoldsby ballad which describes <lb/>
that brilliant scene, and where she is quaintly alluded <lb/>
to as the <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"Famale heiress, Miss Anjaley Coutts."</l>
</lg></q>
And many a festivity in connection with that time of <lb/>
national rejoicing was graced by the presence of the <lb/>
tall, stately young lady, with her sweetly grave and <lb/>
refined face and jewels of fabulous worth.</p>
<p>The poet Tom Moore has related in his diary that, <lb/>
having seen Miss Coutts in her splendour at the <lb/>
Queen's ball one night, he called upon her the next <lb/>
day, and found her preparing to send back her <lb/>
diamonds to the bank for safe keeping.</p>
<p>With girlish simplicity she asked him if he would like <lb/>
to see her ornaments by daylight. On his replying in <lb/>
the affirmative, she conducted him to a room upstairs <lb/>
where the treasures were deposited. Among them was <lb/>
the famous tiara which had once belonged to the <reg orig="ill-|fated">ill-fated</reg> <lb/>
Marie Antoinette. Moore ventured to ask Miss <lb/>
Coutts what might be the value of the gems, when she <lb/>
answered, "in her quiet way," "I think about a hundred <lb/>
thousand pounds."</p>
<pb n="14" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0185"/>
<p>The Duchess of St. Albans in her will left to her <lb/>
husband the Duke, who survived her some years, an <lb/>
annual income of ten thousand pounds, the life-rent <lb/>
of the town house, No. I, Stratton Street, and of <lb/>
the lovely suburban estate, Holly Lodge&mdash;a small but <lb/>
beautifully situated bungalow-like residence, secluded <lb/>
amid fifty-two acres of well-wooded park upon the <lb/>
picturesque slopes of Highgate&mdash;all of which reverted <lb/>
on his death to Miss Angela Burdett-Coutts, who thus <lb/>
became even more wealthy than she was before.</p>
<p>These two houses she has made her home ever since, <lb/>
being chaperoned during her youthful years by an <lb/>
affectionate old friend named Mrs. Brown, who had at <lb/>
one time been her governess.</p>
<p>In the year 1844, as we have already mentioned, the <lb/>
well-beloved Sir Francis Burdett went to his rest, but <lb/>
although Miss Burdett-Coutts lost both father and <lb/>
mother by almost one stroke, she possessed the <reg orig="friend-|ship">friendship</reg> <lb/>
of some of the noblest and most honoured in the <lb/>
land, among whom may be numbered Her Royal <reg orig="High-|ness">Highness</reg> <lb/>
the late lamented Duchess of Teck, the venerable <lb/>
Duke of Wellington&mdash;who, we are told, was her <reg orig="confi-|dential">confidential</reg> <lb/>
adviser, "taking a fatherly interest in the young <lb/>
girl with her millions of money and her large heart"&mdash; <lb/>
Garrick the actor, and the then rising novelist, Charles <lb/>
Dickens. Miss Coutts was one of the first to recognise <lb/>
the genius of the latter, and he in his turn arousing the <lb/>
sympathy of the heiress in the sorrows and privations of <lb/>
the poor, was thus the means of directing her wealth <lb/>
into a channel of incalculable good.</p>
<p>Together they visited some of the worst dens of <lb/>
misery the Metropolis contained, but this is a topic <lb/>
which belongs to another chapter.</p>

LONDON'S GREAT BENEFACTRESS.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">We</hi> have already alluded to the inspiring influence <lb/>
of the great novelist, Charles Dickens, upon <lb/>
Miss Burdett-Coutts, an influence which she gratefully <lb/>
acknowledges, still cherishing the remembrance of his <lb/>
companionship and help in her work among the East <lb/>
End poor.</p>
<p>One of the most notable of the lady's schemes of <lb/>
public benevolence was the transformation of a spot <lb/>
once known as Nova Scotia Gardens, in the <reg orig="neighbour-|hood">neighbourhood</reg> <lb/>
of Bethnal Green. Here scores of families of the <lb/>
lowest class were huddled together in surroundings of <lb/>
indescribable squalor. Dust and refuse, shot there with <lb/>
impunity, had been left to rot and fill the air with foul <lb/>
stenches and the germs of fever; while the moral <reg orig="con-|dition">condition</reg> <lb/>
of the inhabitants was quite on a par with their <lb/>
physical pollution.</p>
<p>Nova Scotia Gardens, we are told, was "a resort of <lb/>
murderers, thieves, disreputable, and abandoned," a <lb/>
haunt of terror even to the police, a hot-bed of vice <lb/>
and disease.</p>
<p>This locality Miss Burdett-Coutts bought up <reg orig="whole-|sale">wholesale</reg>, <lb/>
and having possessed herself of the freehold, she <reg orig="pro-|ceeded">proceeded</reg> <lb/>
to have the wretched houses, one and all, razed <lb/>
to the ground. In their place she erected four blocks <lb/>
of model dwellings, designed to accommodate about <lb/>
two hundred families, fitted with laundry <reg orig="accommoda-|tion">accommodation</reg>, <lb/>
baths, etc., and with such excellently planned <lb/>
sanitary arrangements, ventilation, and windows, that, <lb/>
though built long before such subjects had come to be <lb/>
<pb n="17" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0188"/>
matters of legislation, Columbia Square, as the spot was <lb/>
renamed, holds its own even to-day.</p>
<p>Another philanthropic work in which Charles Dickens <lb/>
was specially interested was a Home for women of the <lb/>
criminal class who were willing to try and lead a <reg orig="re-|formed">reformed</reg> <lb/>
life. This was the Urania College at Shepherd's <lb/>
Bush.</p>
<p>"The novelist," says a writer in <hi rend="italic">The Young Woman</hi>, <lb/>
"drew up the rules, superintended the purchase of <lb/>
land and buildings, and attended personally to the <lb/>
furnishing. He visited the prisons, interviewed <reg orig="magis-|trates">magistrates</reg> <lb/>
and governors, and wrote letters, such as only he <lb/>
could write, to many an unhappy woman in need of a <lb/>
helping hand."</p>
<p>These letters, which were sent anonymously, and <lb/>
addressed "To a Woman," were models of simplicity, <lb/>
tenderness, and most winning sympathy. "Do not <lb/>
think I write to you as if I felt very much above you," <lb/>
said the great-hearted man, "or wished to hurt your <lb/>
feelings by reminding you of the situation in which you <lb/>
are placed. God forbid! I mean nothing but kindness <lb/>
to you, and I write to you as if you were my sister."</p>
<p>The letter goes on to invite the recipient to start a <lb/>
new life in a pleasant country home, which has been <lb/>
opened by "a lady in this town, who, from the windows <lb/>
of her house, has seen such as you going past at night, <lb/>
and has felt her heart bleed at the sight."</p>
<p>In this home, they were told, there would be no harsh <lb/>
or arbitrary rules, no distinctive dress, and no reference <lb/>
to the past.</p>
<p>And, furthermore, "because it is not the lady's wish <lb/>
that these young women should be shut out from the <lb/>
world after they have repented and have learned to <lb/>
do their duty there, and because it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> her wish and <lb/>
<pb n="18" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0189"/>
object that they may be restored to society, they will <lb/>
be supplied with every means, when some time shall <lb/>
have elapsed and their conduct shall have proved their <lb/>
earnestness and reformation, to go abroad, where in a <lb/>
distant country they may become the faithful wives of <lb/>
honest men, and live and die in peace."</p>
<p>Although Dickens was the actual writer of these <lb/>
beautiful letters, we think we may safely assume that <lb/>
many of the sentiments expressed were those of the <lb/>
benevolent lady to whose tender sympathy the helpful <lb/>
scheme was originally due, for, as has been remarked, <lb/>
they are "instinct with the love such as only one <lb/>
woman can feel for another."</p>
<p>It is good to know that the affectionate invitation <lb/>
was in many cases accepted. The poor fallen creatures <lb/>
were tempted by the prospect of the "active, cheerful, <lb/>
healthy life" promised them, and the hope held out <lb/>
to them of being able to "win a good name and <lb/>
character," and came to Urania College, whence in due <lb/>
course they were equipped for emigration and started <lb/>
in life afresh. The record of the college, we are told, <lb/>
"has been more than gratifying to its benefactress."</p>
<p>Hard by Columbia Square stands that wonderful <lb/>
erection known as Columbia Market, a building of its <lb/>
kind without rival in the whole world.</p>
<p>Impressed with the fact that our sea-girt land is <lb/>
surrounded by supplies of delicious food, which, seeing <lb/>
that nothing is ever spent upon its rearing or <reg orig="cultiva-|tion">cultivation</reg>, <lb/>
ought to be cheaper than any other kind of meat, <lb/>
Miss Burdett-Coutts resolved to found a fish market <lb/>
in one of the poorest parts of London, that working <lb/>
people might be able to procure as an article of daily <lb/>
sustenance that which, owing to the prohibitive prices <lb/>
imposed by the then only existing market of <reg orig="Billings-|gate">Billingsgate</reg>, <lb/>
<pb n="19" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0190"/>
was, except in the form of the common red <lb/>
herring, almost a delicacy unknown.</p>
<p>The grandeur and beauty of the building erected <lb/>
near Hackney Road with this end in view is the <lb/>
marvel of all who see it. With its stately marble <lb/>
columns, handsome ornamentation, and suitable <reg orig="in-|scriptions">inscriptions</reg> <lb/>
from the Bible &lpar;made more elaborate than <lb/>
otherwise might have been from a wish to give <reg orig="employ-|ment">employment</reg> <lb/>
to the stone-cutters and carvers at that time out <lb/>
of work&rpar; the spacious pile is more like a cathedral or <lb/>
some such grand public building than an ordinary <lb/>
market. And, indeed, a high dignitary of the Church <lb/>
declared that nothing was wanting but a pulpit there <lb/>
to make him feel perfectly at home.</p>
<p>However, notwithstanding the fact that Columbia <lb/>
Market was opened impressively in the presence of <lb/>
Royalty in the year 1869, it has never from that time <lb/>
to the present been used for the purpose intended, <lb/>
except for a short period at the outset, when a brave <lb/>
struggle was made to survive the opposition of the <lb/>
Billingsgate "ring" in vain. And it now stands a <lb/>
lasting monument to the munificence and kind feeling <lb/>
of the foundress and the selfish greed of those in whose <lb/>
grasp the fish trade lay.</p>
<p>More successful has been another erection of Miss <lb/>
Coutts's generosity of a different kind. We allude to <lb/>
the church and schools of St. Stephen, Westminster. <lb/>
These handsome buildings, the initial cost of which is <lb/>
said to have been nearly &pound;100,000, are the Baroness's <lb/>
memorial to her father, who was educated at <reg orig="West-|minster">Westminster</reg> <lb/>
School and was parliamentary representative <lb/>
of that district for thirty years.</p>
<p>Besides building and providing for the larger part <lb/>
of the endowment of this splendid edifice, the Baroness <lb/>
<pb n="20" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0191"/>
has maintained the whole work, including the expenses <lb/>
of the Technical Instiute and the numberless social <lb/>
and benevolent agencies connected with it, from the <lb/>
opening in 1850 until the present time. St. Stephen's <lb/>
is a church well worth a visit, both on account of the <lb/>
beauty of its architecture and the interesting relics <lb/>
which it contains, the Duke of Wellington having <lb/>
presented the altar cloth, as well as the silk curtain <lb/>
which hangs over the pulpit. This latter, which is <lb/>
of sixteenth-century manufacture, was taken from the <lb/>
tent of Tippoo Sahib at the storming of Seringapatam. <lb/>
There is also a wonderful carpet to be seen here, <lb/>
worked by some of the most famous ladies in the <lb/>
land, depicting the arms of the Baroness, and of the <lb/>
various bishoprics, churches, etc., with which her name <lb/>
is inseparably connected.</p>
<p>Clubs, guilds, classes, and a thriving self-help society <lb/>
are all flourishing offshoots of St. Stephen's; and in <lb/>
the schools, embracing a complete curriculum of <lb/>
education for the youth of the working classes, and <lb/>
said to be the most efficient in London, upwards of <lb/>
fifteen thousand boys and girls have already been <lb/>
trained; while hundreds of aspiring lads are receiving <lb/>
at the institute instruction in various arts and crafts <lb/>
which will be beneficial to them all their lives.</p>
<p>To pass from visible and tangible monuments of <lb/>
the Baroness's generosity to the not less enduring <lb/>
memories in thousands of grateful hearts, we will speak <lb/>
first of the assistance rendered to the "hand weavers," <lb/>
when, between thirty and forty years ago, they were <lb/>
brought to destitution by the importation of foreign <lb/>
silks, and existing attempts to relieve their sufferings <lb/>
had proved unequal to the stupendous task.</p>
<p>Then Miss Coutts took the matter up, and the <lb/>
<pb n="21" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0192"/>
resources of her purse were unstintingly drawn upon. <lb/>
"Some of the people," says the <foreign lang="dut"><hi rend="italic">Strand Magazine</hi></foreign>, "were <lb/>
sent out of the country as emigrants; others were given <lb/>
the means of starting in little businesses; girls were <lb/>
suitably trained for respectable situations; and work <lb/>
was found for women in a sort of sewing-room, where, <lb/>
after 1.30 in the day, they could earn from 8<hi rend="italic">s.</hi> to 15<hi rend="italic">s.</hi> <lb/>
per week, thus helping very materially to keep things <lb/>
going. The work consisted of shirt-making for the <lb/>
police and soldiers, and one very good feature of the <lb/>
plan was that each woman as she came in was given <lb/>
a good hearty meal to commence with. Some, who on <lb/>
account of their families could not leave home, were <lb/>
allowed to have their work out; thus large numbers <lb/>
were benefited."</p>
<p>The men and boys were also helped with work, <lb/>
while to the sick and needy clothing, blankets, and <lb/>
nourishing food were freely given; hundreds were <lb/>
assisted to emigrate to the colonies, in most cases <lb/>
by the loan of passage money, which, we are glad to <lb/>
say, was nearly all faithfully repaid; and "nothing that <lb/>
money or care could do was left undone."</p>
<p>In 1867 an epidemic of cholera broke out in East <lb/>
London, and again the Baroness was foremost among <lb/>
those who rendered aid to the sufferers. Eight trained <lb/>
nurses were paid by her to tend the sick in their own <lb/>
homes, while two sanitary inspectors, with four men to <lb/>
give out disinfectants, were constantly employed, all <lb/>
being under the direction of a qualified medical man.</p>
<p>A summary of one week's distribution of invalid <lb/>
necessaries at that terrible time has been given as <lb/>
follows: "1,850 tickets for meat, of the value of one <lb/>
shilling each, 250 pounds of arrowroot, 500 pounds <lb/>
of rice, 50 pounds each of sago and tapioca, 30 pounds <lb/>
<pb n="22" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0193"/>
of black-curr.&hellip;t jelly, 50 gallons of port wine, 25 gallons <lb/>
of brandy, 20 gallons of beef tea, 560 quarts of milk, <lb/>
100 blankets, 400 yards of flannel, and 400 garments." <lb/>
And all at the Baroness Burdett-Coutts's sole expense!</p>
<p>The distressed tanners are another class who will long <lb/>
remember our heroine's name with gratitude, as will <lb/>
also the shoeblacks and flower-girls of the great city. <lb/>
The latter class, as well as the former, have been <lb/>
organised into a "brigade," the object of which is not <lb/>
only to help them in various ways in their present <lb/>
occupation, but also to fit such of them as may desire <lb/>
it for domestic service, and to teach artificial <reg orig="flower-|making">flower-making</reg> <lb/>
to those disposed to learn. In this way <reg orig="up-|wards">upwards</reg> <lb/>
of 1,000 girls have been assisted into more <lb/>
sheltered and less precarious modes of earning their <lb/>
living.</p>
<p>Children, of course, have always had a warm place <lb/>
in the large heart of the Baroness, and at one time <lb/>
thousands of little Londoners were given a glimpse <lb/>
into fairyland by annual visits to the lovely grounds of <lb/>
Holly Lodge. It was largely owing to her endeavours, <lb/>
her pity being roused by one shocking case of brutality <lb/>
and neglect, that the National Society for the Prevention <lb/>
of Cruelty to Children first came into existence, and she <lb/>
helped greatly in the passing of what is known as the <lb/>
"Children's Charter" through Parliament in the year <lb/>
1889. The first committee meeting was held in the <lb/>
Baroness's own drawing-room, and now, to the relief <lb/>
of maltreated little ones &lpar;and the disgrace of English <lb/>
civilisation!&rpar; an average of 10,000 heartless parents are <lb/>
dealt with every year.</p>
<p>Food for the underfed is another necessary for growing <lb/>
bodies, and the Destitute Children's Dinner Society, <lb/>
which annually provides 300,000 good nourishing meals <lb/>
<pb n="23" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0194"/>
at a halfpenny or a penny each, has always met with <lb/>
her bountiful support. Nor are the softer amenities of <lb/>
life ignored by the refined and gentle lady, for she <lb/>
generously assists the movement for promoting a love <lb/>
of flowers among the poor. Every summer hundreds <lb/>
of plants are distributed to brighten dull and sordid <lb/>
homes, prizes being awarded at the end of the season <lb/>
for those that are brought for exhibition showing signs <lb/>
of most careful cultivation.</p>
<p>The hardships of costermongers, also, have called <lb/>
forth her ladyship's sympathy, and when not so very <lb/>
long ago they were in danger of being altogether <reg orig="ex-|tinguished">extinguished</reg> <lb/>
by their calling being rendered illegal, she <lb/>
sent her own solicitor to defend their cause and bring <lb/>
them off triumphant.</p>
<p>Many a street-hawker has cause to bless the Baroness <lb/>
for this valuable aid, as well as in many cases for <reg orig="assist-|ance">assistance</reg> <lb/>
in becoming the owner of his own barrow, clubs <lb/>
having been promoted by her with this end in view.</p>
<p>From the coster to his donkey the transition is <lb/>
natural, a small silver model of that most honourable <lb/>
of beasts, presented to her by one of the coster clubs, <lb/>
being a valued ornament of Holly Lodge. Like the <lb/>
late Earl of Shaftesbury, the Baroness has done much <lb/>
to encourage kindness on the part of the men to their <lb/>
faithful little "mokes" by giving prizes for those animals <lb/>
which could be shown in the best condition.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that one so tender-hearted <lb/>
towards all forms of suffering is warmly sympathetic <lb/>
to dumb and defenceless creatures of every kind. From <lb/>
the beginning the name of Miss Burdett-Coutts has <lb/>
been associated with the work of the Royal Society for <lb/>
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Many of us still <lb/>
remember the prizes she offered to the schools, both public <lb/>

ON KINDNESS TO ANIMALS.</head>
</figure>
<pb n="25" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0196"/>
and private, throughout the kingdom for the best essays <lb/>
on the subject of kindness to animals, and the grand <lb/>
occasions when the same were distributed, often by <lb/>
Royalty, and once by Her Majesty herself in person.</p>
<p>These essays and prizes, which must have done much <lb/>
to spread an intelligent appreciation of the dumb creation <lb/>
and its needs, were the result of a visit to the Baroness <lb/>
of an American gentleman, a Mr. Angell, of Boston, <lb/>
who had given up a lucrative profession to devote <reg orig="him-|self">himself</reg> <lb/>
to the cause of animals, and on coming to England <lb/>
at once sought the lady whose tender-heartedness and <lb/>
generosity were already of world-wide fame, to ask her <lb/>
help in the endeavour to teach mercy and kindness to <lb/>
the rising generation.</p>
<p>In cart-horses and their masters the Baroness has <lb/>
shown her practical interest, taking much pleasure in <lb/>
those annual "parades" to which on May Day or <reg orig="Whit-|Monday">Whit-Monday</reg> <lb/>
one sees the noble beasts wending their way, <lb/>
amusingly decked out in rosettes, tassels, and other <lb/>
trappings of every gaudy hue.</p>
<p>She has also been touched by the sufferings of tram <lb/>
and 'bus horses, and done what she could to ameliorate <lb/>
their lot. As for birds, it is needless to say that no <lb/>
aigrette or plume ever decks her bonnet. She <reg orig="stigma-|tises">stigmatises</reg> <lb/>
a bird used for millinery purposes as "a mode of <lb/>
ornamentation which must suggest a bloodstain on <lb/>
the delicate hat or cap." As President of the Ladies' <lb/>
Committee of the R.S.P.C.A., the Baroness has spoken <lb/>
at meetings all over the country; but to touch upon <lb/>
her ladyship's more extended schemes of benevolence <lb/>
we must needs commence another chapter.</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="III" id="d43">
<pb n="26" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0197"/>
<head><hi rend="bold">CHAPTER III. <lb/>
A WORLD-WIDE MUNIFICENCE.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">As</hi> we have already hinted, it is not to London or <lb/>
even to England that the benefactions of the <lb/>
Baroness Burdett-Coutts have been confined. There is <lb/>
scarcely a spot on the civilised globe where her name is <lb/>
not a synonym for benevolence on an absolutely regal <lb/>
scale.</p>
<p>Ever since the terrible famine of 1848 first aroused <lb/>
her sympathy for the wretched condition of thousands <lb/>
of the Irish people, the Green Isle and its sorrows has <lb/>
appealed eloquently to her heart. And when, between <lb/>
twenty and thirty years ago, she became acquainted <lb/>
with the destitute condition of the peasantry in the <lb/>
fishing villages of Skibbereen, Baltimore, and others <lb/>
on the south coast of Ireland, she promptly placed the <lb/>
sum of &pound;10,000 in the hands of Father Davis, the <lb/>
people's trusted friend, to be lent out to the fishermen <lb/>
in sums large enough to provide them with new boats.</p>
<p>When we read that their only means of livelihood <lb/>
was at such a low ebb, through famine and misfortune, <lb/>
that Scots were fishing in the Irish waters and selling <lb/>
the fish to those of the Irish who could afford to buy <lb/>
them, we can realise the poor people's joy and gratitude <lb/>
on being given, as it were, a fresh start in life.</p>
<p>The money, which was apportioned to deserving men <lb/>
in sums of from &pound;150 to &pound;300, in loans to be repaid <lb/>
by small yearly instalments, has, we rejoice to say, all <lb/>
been refunded, a fact which reflects great credit on the <lb/>
thrift and honour of those Cork fishermen, and is a just <lb/>
cause of pride to them and their friends.</p>
<p>Another practical scheme by which the Baroness has <lb/>
<pb n="27" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0198"/>
greatly aided the same people has been by the founding <lb/>
in 1887 of a kind of college of fishery, in which boys <lb/>
could be thoroughly taught boat-building, net-making, <lb/>
carpentering, coopering, repairs of all kinds, and the <lb/>
art of fish-curing. About four hundred students can <lb/>
be accommodated in this school at once, and it is hoped <lb/>
that the technical knowledge here obtained will be <lb/>
security against the recurrence of so deplorable a state <lb/>
of things as that from which by Lady Burdett-Coutts's <lb/>
generosity the fishermen of Skibbereen were saved.</p>
<p>During the Russo-Turkish War of 1877, thousands <lb/>
of the inhabitants of the villages on the Danube fled <lb/>
in panic from the approach of the Russians. The <lb/>
sufferings of these poor people&mdash;innocent victims to <lb/>
the horrors of war&mdash;are terrible to read about; famine, <lb/>
sickness, cold, rain and snow killed hundreds of them <lb/>
upon the roads, and when they at length reached <lb/>
Constantinople they were homeless, until the authorities <lb/>
took pity on them and allowed them to shelter in the <lb/>
mosques. Some of the rich townspeople also threw <lb/>
open their houses, and the Sultan permitted many of <lb/>
them to take refuge in the royal palace itself.</p>
<p>No sooner did the Baroness hear of the miseries of <lb/>
these poor wanderers than she wrote an eloquent letter <lb/>
to the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi>, entreating the public to "stanch <lb/>
their life-blood" and "bind up their wounds, if not by <lb/>
our money, by our sympathy," and hoping that their <lb/>
anguish would soon "begin to be soothed through that <lb/>
real Christianity which is still, in God's providence, <lb/>
the appointed means by which hunger and thirst are <lb/>
assuaged, sickness alleviated, and consolation given."</p>
<p>The result of this appeal was the institution of the <lb/>
Turkish Compassionate Fund, by means of which <lb/>
the sum of &pound;30,000 was raised in the course of a <lb/>
<pb n="28" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0199"/>
few days, which, with an immense quantity of food <lb/>
and clothing, was sent out to be distributed under the <lb/>
direction of the gentleman now known as Mr. <reg orig="Burdett-|Coutts">Burdett-Coutts</reg>, <lb/>
Sir Francis de Winton, and other discreet <lb/>
almoners. By this means the sufferings of thousands of <lb/>
families were alleviated and the lives of numbers saved.</p>
<p>In the comfort and well-being of soldiers on foreign <lb/>
service Lady Burdett-Coutts has shown special interest. <lb/>
In the Crimean War she sent out a number of patent <lb/>
drying-sheds for the men to be able to dry their wet <lb/>
clothing. She was actively interested in the welfare of <lb/>
our soldiers in Zululand. During the Soudan Campaign <lb/>
she provided homes for the wives and children of the <lb/>
Coldstream Guards when the latter were ordered abroad.</p>
<p>The inhabitants of Abeokeuta, in Africa, have to <lb/>
thank Heaven for the wealthy English lady who <reg orig="pre-|sented">presented</reg> <lb/>
them with their first cotton-gin, thus giving a <lb/>
lasting impetus to the trade which is their chief means of <lb/>
subsistence. And the bishopric of Cape Town, as well <lb/>
as those of British Columbia and Adelaide, was founded <lb/>
by the same lady. Some idea of the cost of these may <lb/>
be formed when it is known that for one only, including <lb/>
endowment of church, of bishopric, and partial cost of <lb/>
clergy, the Baroness expended no less than &pound;50,000.</p>
<p>It was the Baroness, too, who provided the necessary <lb/>
funds for a complete topographical survey of Jerusalem; <lb/>
and if the Holy City is not at the present moment <lb/>
enjoying a constant supply of pure water it is not <lb/>
because that boon has not been offered, for her ladyship <lb/>
actually proposed to reinstate the ancient aqueducts <lb/>
of Solomon, though for some reason her munificent <lb/>
scheme was never carried out.</p>
<p>But volumes might be filled did one attempt to give <lb/>
anything like an exhaustive account of the benefactions <lb/>
<pb n="29" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0200"/>
of this queenly woman to the generation in which she <lb/>
has lived. There is scarcely a good work extant in <lb/>
either hemisphere which has not at some time or other <lb/>
been cheered by her practical sympathy and help.</p>
<p>To pass from the greater to the smaller, though <lb/>
perhaps not less important, of the monuments to the <lb/>
<figure id="f36" rend="block" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0200">
<head>THE DRINKING-FOUNTAIN IN VICTORIA PARK, LONDON.</head>
</figure>
all-embracing charity of the Baroness Burdett-Coutts, <lb/>
we may mention that she has presented lifeboats to <lb/>
two English towns, and one to St. Malo, on the coast <lb/>
of France. Many have been the churches restored by <lb/>
her aid, many the peals of bells&mdash;provided by her&mdash;that <lb/>
ring out a perpetual reminder of her generosity. Of <lb/>
the preservation of commons and open spaces for the <lb/>
<pb n="30" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0201"/>
people she has been one of the foremost supporters; <lb/>
she helped to retain for public health and enjoyment <lb/>
the sylvan beauty of Hampstead Heath, that wide <reg orig="play-|ground">playground</reg> <lb/>
in the north of London; and several <reg orig="church-|yards">churchyards</reg> <lb/>
by her instrumentality have been turned into <lb/>
quiet gardens of greenness, rest, and shade for the tired <lb/>
dwellers in hot city streets.</p>
<p>As to drinking-fountains for man and beast, they are <lb/>
dotted all over the country, the most notable being <lb/>
those in Victoria Park &lpar;a magnificent structure&rpar;, the <lb/>
Columbia Market, the Zoological Gardens, and at <lb/>
Ancoats, Manchester. There is also a handsome <lb/>
fountain erected by the Baroness at the corner of the <lb/>
George the Fourth Bridge in Edinburgh, with which <lb/>
so touching a story is connected that we cannot refrain <lb/>
from telling it ere we pass to the final and more <lb/>
personal chapter of our sketch.</p>
<p>In the year 1858 a man named Grey died in <reg orig="Edin-|burgh">Edinburgh</reg>, <lb/>
and was buried in Greyfriars churchyard. He <lb/>
had few friends, and his chief mourner was his little dog <lb/>
"Bobby." Day after day the faithful creature returned <lb/>
to the grave, and though driven away, always came back <lb/>
again, until the caretaker, taking pity, got into the habit <lb/>
of feeding him. The grave was unmarked by any <reg orig="head-|stone">headstone</reg>, <lb/>
and in course of time became levelled with the <lb/>
surrounding sod and undistinguishable. But Bobby <lb/>
never forgot the spot. Year after year he continued <lb/>
to visit the place where he had seen his dear master laid, <lb/>
until he became well known by compassionate residents, <lb/>
and was regularly fed by them.</p>
<p>When the dog-tax was instituted, in 1867, many <lb/>
persons came forward to pay for Bobby, but the Lord <lb/>
Provost, hearing his story, decreed that he should be <lb/>
exempt, and, moreover, presented the animal with a <lb/>
<pb n="31" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0202"/>
handsome collar. The little creature continued to visit <lb/>
the grave constantly until his death in 1872, and then, on <lb/>
the Baroness Burdett-Coutts becoming acquainted with <lb/>
this wonderful instance of canine faithfulness, she decided <lb/>
to commemorate it in a characteristic and suitable way.</p>
<p>To-day a bronze figure of Bobby may be seen <reg orig="sur-|mounting">surmounting</reg> <lb/>
a handsome red marble column, which also <lb/>
supports a drinking-fountain, and has at its base a <reg orig="water-|trough">watertrough</reg> <lb/>
for dogs. On the column the late Professor <lb/>
Blackie recorded the virtues of Bobby and the generosity <lb/>
of the donor of his monument in an inscription in both <lb/>
English and Greek.</p>

<div2 type="chapter" n="IV" id="d44">
<head><hi rend="bold">CHAPTER IV. <lb/>
"THE SECOND LADY IN THE LAND."</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">We</hi> have left to the last an account of the various <lb/>
honours and evidences of appreciation with <lb/>
which the almost fabulous generosity of the Baroness <lb/>
Burdett-Coutts has been marked, and also what slight <lb/>
account of her private life during her later years her <lb/>
ladyship's naturally retiring disposition has rendered <lb/>
accessible to the public.</p>
<p>To begin with, the elevation of Miss Burdett-Coutts <lb/>
to the peerage in 1871 was unquestionably a token of <lb/>
Her Majesty's approbation of her many noble deeds, <lb/>
and a distinction, unique in itself as thus merited, which <lb/>
was followed throughout the country by acclamations <lb/>
of delight. It was the Prince of Wales who bestowed <lb/>
upon the Baroness the illustrious epithet which heads <lb/>
our present chapter.</p>
<p>The subject of our sketch also wears the Turkish <lb/>
Orders of the Medjidieh and the Shafakat&mdash;the former <lb/>
never before conferred upon a woman&mdash;in recognition by <lb/>
the Sultan of her efforts on behalf of the Turkish refugees.</p>
<pb n="32" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0203"/>
<p>Long, however, before Miss Coutts received a legal <lb/>
title she was known by the warm-hearted and thankful <lb/>
people of County Cork as "Lady Coutts," and <reg orig="occa-|sionally">occasionally</reg> <lb/>
as "<hi rend="italic">Your Lordship</hi>, Lady Coutts"! And at <lb/>
the time of her visit with her husband, in 1884, to the <lb/>
district her generosity had saved from ruin, she was <lb/>
hailed with the flying of flags, tablecloths, and <reg orig="pocket-|handkerchiefs">pocket-handkerchiefs</reg> <lb/>
from every available point, with bonfires <lb/>
by night, and with cheering crowds who rapturously <lb/>
welcomed her as "Queen of Baltimore."</p>
<p>As a mark of public gratitude for the benefits the <lb/>
Baroness has lavished upon the Metropolis, the <reg orig="presen-|tation">presentation</reg> <lb/>
of the freedom of the city of London&mdash;a very rare <lb/>
distinction for women&mdash;is among the many honours that <lb/>
have been shown her. The official ceremony, which was <lb/>
performed at the Guildhall, in July, 1872, was a very <lb/>
brilliant and imposing spectacle. The freedom of several <lb/>
provincial cities has also been conferred upon her.</p>
<p>On May Day, 1882, when the Baroness visited <reg orig="New-|castle">Newcastle</reg> <lb/>
to award the prizes in the cart-horse parade in <lb/>
that town, a hundred thousand people were assembled <lb/>
in the streets to see her, and flowers were strewn in her <lb/>
path. Noisy demonstrations of joy were prohibited for <lb/>
fear of frightening the nervous animals, but the <reg orig="en-|thusiasm">enthusiasm</reg> <lb/>
of the crowds could not be repressed. The <lb/>
driver whose horse took the first prize doffed his cap, <lb/>
and seizing the Baroness's hand shook it heartily, this <lb/>
action evoking uproarious cheers. Each prize-winner <lb/>
in succession followed suit, then her ladyship made a <lb/>
speech, which, amid loud cheers and cries of "God <lb/>
bless you!" ended with the words, that "in this life <lb/>
man and beast are held together by God's own chain <lb/>
under one law."</p>
<p>Another evidence of the immense popularity of the <lb/>
<pb n="33" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0204"/>
Baroness with the masses was afforded during the <lb/>
Reform Bill agitation of recent years. A great <reg orig="pro-|cession">procession</reg> <lb/>
organised at that time was conducted past her <lb/>
house in Stratton Street, and her ladyship being seen <lb/>
at the window, the crowd, probably remembering the <lb/>
notable occurrence at the self-same house during a similar <lb/>
agitation many years before, stood vociferously cheering <lb/>
her for two, or, as some accounts have it, for <hi rend="italic">three</hi> hours!</p>
<p>Of the private friendships with the good, the famous, <lb/>
and the great, which the subject of our sketch has <lb/>
during her long life enjoyed we may only briefly <lb/>
speak. The character of the Baroness has always been <lb/>
appreciated by Royalty. The late Duchess of Teck, <lb/>
in a letter to the President of the Board of Lady <lb/>
Managers of the World's Columbian Exhibition, wrote: <lb/>
"I have known intimately the Baroness all my life, <lb/>
have valued her friendship, and have often participated <lb/>
in some of her work." And members of our reigning <lb/>
family have frequently been guests at Holly Lodge.</p>
<p>The grandest general of the day, as we have seen, <lb/>
was the trusted friend and adviser of Miss Coutts's <reg orig="girl-|hood">girlhood</reg>, <lb/>
the greatest novelist her companion in charitable <lb/>
work; and a plain little inkstand, to be seen among <lb/>
the Baroness's cherished keepsakes, commemorates the <lb/>
regard of one of our sweetest singers, Thomas Moore.</p>
<p>Of the heroes of Christianity, Dr. Moffat, Dr. <reg orig="Living-|stone">Livingstone</reg>, <lb/>
and in more recent years the soldier saint, <lb/>
General Gordon, have been numbered among her <lb/>
friends. The latter loved to talk over with the Baroness <lb/>
his enthusiastic desires for the betterment of the <lb/>
Soudanese, and one of his last hours in England prior <lb/>
to his hurried departure for Africa&mdash;never, alas! to <lb/>
return&mdash;were spent with her.</p>
<p>On this never-to-be-forgotten occasion Gordon begged <lb/>
<pb n="34" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0205"/>
of his true and valued friend a small letter-case as a <lb/>
keepsake. And the Baroness has received indisputable <lb/>
proof that he carried this gift in his breast-pocket until <lb/>
his death.</p>
<p>It must have given her ladyship keen pleasure to <lb/>
devote some of her all-commanding wealth to alleviating <lb/>
the dreary exile of that noble man; for through her <lb/>
bold and rather romantic scheme of employing a <lb/>
Morocco merchant in disguise to obtain admission to <lb/>
Khartoum, Gordon received the last packet of letters <lb/>
and papers that ever reached him from home.</p>
<p>In the year 1881 the Baroness somewhat startled <lb/>
her intimates, as well as the world at large, by marrying <lb/>
Mr. William Ashmead-Bartlett, she being at that time <lb/>
sixty-seven years of age and the gentleman but thirty; <lb/>
the bridegroom on that occasion taking the bride's <lb/>
name instead of the contrary, as usual, being the case.</p>
<p>However, whatever misgivings the public may have <lb/>
felt at the outset as to the wisdom of this one act <lb/>
in the lady's well-ordered life, the sequel has proved <lb/>
that her good sense and clear judgment did not err. <lb/>
An intimate personal friend of the Baroness assured <lb/>
a writer in <hi rend="italic">The Young Woman</hi> that "happy as her <lb/>
life has always been, the last years have been by far <lb/>
the happiest part of it."</p>
<p>The description of Holly Lodge given by the only <lb/>
interviewer ever privileged to pass its threshold, Miss <lb/>
Mary Spencer - Warren&mdash;to whose most interesting <lb/>
article in the <foreign lang="dut"><hi rend="italic">Strand Magasine</hi></foreign> we are already largely <lb/>
indebted&mdash;is fascinating. A house filled with gems <lb/>
of art, mementoes of good works, and souvenirs of <lb/>
notable people, stands in rural seclusion amid lovely <lb/>
flowers and spreading trees that cast cool woodland <lb/>
shadows upon the greenest of grass. A home where, <lb/>
<pb n="35" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0206"/>
as one might expect, pets are everywhere in evidence <lb/>
both indoors and out, from the valuable horses of which <lb/>
Mr. Burdett-Coutts is a connoisseur, and the white <lb/>
donkey which was the gift of a number of grateful <lb/>
costermongers, to the goats, the cows, the pigs, the <lb/>
chickens, the birds, and last, but by no means least, the <lb/>
numerous members of the canine race which the Baroness <lb/>
numbers among her household. A peaceful, beautiful <lb/>
home, where one rejoices to think that the latter days <lb/>
of one who has done so much to promote the happiness <lb/>
of others are calmly and pleasantly gliding past.</p>
<p>So stupendous have been the charitable deeds of <lb/>
Lady Burdett-Coutts, and so tangibly do they appeal <lb/>
to the world, that one is in some danger of overlooking <lb/>
the good that must have been done by her wise and <lb/>
persuasive words. The Baroness has spoken a great <lb/>
deal in public, both in the cause of the defenceless and <lb/>
suffering, and by way of giving good advice, especially <lb/>
to the young of her own sex.</p>
<p>One or two specimens only of the latter must suffice. <lb/>
Speaking at Whitelands Training College, where for <lb/>
many years she awarded prizes for various practical <lb/>
accomplishments, such as household work, needlework, <lb/>
and household management, the Baroness gave <reg orig="ex-|pression">expression</reg> <lb/>
to the following sentiments on the subject of <lb/>
"The Influence of the Head of the Family."</p>
<p>After remarking that "whom a woman appoints to <lb/>
that position lies entirely within her own choice," her <lb/>
ladyship proceeded to say that "teachers would be <lb/>
doing a kindness to point out this to the elder girls <lb/>
when they leave school, and to advise them before <lb/>
marrying to observe carefully the habits and conduct <lb/>
towards others of those who wish them to enter into <lb/>
so serious and responsible an engagement."</p>
<pb n="36" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0207"/>
<p>On another occasion the Baroness, in an address to <lb/>
the pupils of the same college, said, "A woman rules <lb/>
her family after her husband's spirit. His influence is <lb/>
unavoidably felt, and he is either her mainstay in the <lb/>
trials of life, or a weight which crushes her. If she <lb/>
have linked herself either to a man of careless habits, <lb/>
or to an irreligious man, or to one simply idle and <lb/>
self-indulgent, she will have a hard fight in life's battle; <lb/>
and when she strives to train her children and implant <lb/>
good seed in their minds, though she can indeed <reg orig="pre-|serve">preserve</reg> <lb/>
herself personally blameless, she must feel lonely, <lb/>
doubtful, and depressed, if, side by side with the good <lb/>
wheat of religious precept and commandment, she has <lb/>
sown the tares of her husband's silent but all-powerful <lb/>
example."</p>
<p>Of the acknowledged weight and influence of Lady <lb/>
Burdett-Coutts's public utterances a rather amusing <lb/>
proof was on one occasion afforded. She had been <lb/>
urging the desirability of neatness and simplicity in <lb/>
female dress, and suggested that her hearers might <lb/>
help to check the unfortunate habit "which is widely <lb/>
spread among us of not seeming to brush the hair any <lb/>
more, or of wearing other people's."</p>
<p>This speech aroused a considerable amount of <reg orig="atten-|tion">attention</reg>, <lb/>
and one person wrote and protested against it. <lb/>
"With her ladyship's remarks concerning hair," he said, <lb/>
after paving the way by commending other portions of <lb/>
the address, "I cannot coincide." He assumed that the <lb/>
Baroness's knowledge of hairdressing was "only theoretic," <lb/>
though "practical knowledge is the only way by which <lb/>
anyone can be an authority upon so important a subject." <lb/>
"If the above remarks," he concluded, "remain <reg orig="uncon-|tradicted">uncontradicted</reg>, <lb/>
they will be injurious to the public."</p>
<p>It subsequently turned out that the objector was a <lb/>
<pb n="37" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0208"/>
hairdresser, who, like the famous silversmith of Ephesus, <lb/>
feared that his craft was "in danger to be set at naught" <lb/>
by the teaching of a lady so widely respected as the <lb/>
Baroness.</p>
<p>A few years ago Lady Burdett-Coutts added to her <lb/>
other useful works a not unimportant contribution to <lb/>
literature.</p>
<p>This was the compilation, at the urgent desire of <lb/>
H.R.H. the Princess Christian, of a volume in connection <lb/>
with the Chicago Exhibition, entitled <hi rend="italic">Woman's Mission</hi>.</p>
<p>In this volume, which the Baroness edited with <reg orig="con-|siderable">considerable</reg> <lb/>
skill and taste, are gathered together thirty-five <lb/>
able essays on the various phases of woman's special <lb/>
work for the betterment of the world, each written by <lb/>
some lady of practical experience, who could speak from <lb/>
her own personal knowledge of the subject allotted to <lb/>
her. Lady Coutts herself has contributed two of these, <lb/>
and the preface and appendix are also from her pen.</p>
<p>It was owing to the interest aroused in America by <lb/>
this book that an account of the Baroness's public work <lb/>
was published, from which much of the information <lb/>
contained in our present sketch is drawn. And it is <lb/>
in a letter on the subject from H.R.H. the late Duchess <lb/>
of Teck to the President of the Board of Lady Managers <lb/>
of the World's Columbian Exhibition already quoted <lb/>
that these appreciative words occur: "Great as have <lb/>
been the intrinsic benefits which the Baroness has <reg orig="con-|ferred">conferred</reg> <lb/>
on others, the most signal of all has been the <lb/>
power of example&mdash;an incalculable quantity, which no <lb/>
record of events can measure."</p>
<p>This summing up of the character and work of one <lb/>
intimately and affectionately known to the royal writer <lb/>
cannot well be improved upon, and with it our <reg orig="mono-|graph">monograph</reg> <lb/>
shall close.</p>

OF NOBLE BIRTH.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> famous saying that "some are born great, some <lb/>
achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust <lb/>
upon them," is a truism. Those that come under the <lb/>
head of the second order of nobility are the most truly, <lb/>
because the most meritoriously, eminent, and to it most <lb/>
of the world's notable workers belong. But the subject <lb/>
of the present sketch enjoys the distinction of having <lb/>
possessed the first kind of greatness by inheritance <lb/>
before her moral worth and intellectual gifts won for <lb/>
her the second. This is an advantage which, though <lb/>
not indispensable, is by no means to be despised. A <lb/>
titled name, used as a talent entrusted by God, may <lb/>
be made a powerful influence for good.</p>
<p>Lady Isabel Somers-Cocks was the elder of the two <lb/>
children of Earl and Countess Somers. Her sister <lb/>
Adeline is now the Duchess of Bedford. Both inherited <lb/>
no small share of the beauty of their mother, who was <lb/>
one of the celebrated beauties of her day.</p>
<p>Lord Somers belonged to a family whose nobility was <lb/>
more than five hundred years old. Among his ancestors <lb/>
<pb n="39" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0210"/>
is numbered Lord Chancellor Somers, celebrated as <lb/>
successfully defending the seven bishops who were <reg orig="im-|prisoned">imprisoned</reg> <lb/>
in the Tower by James II. on a charge of <lb/>
seditious libel, and afterwards as the chief counsellor <lb/>
of William III. Another ancestor was the Honourable <lb/>
Major Cocks, who fought with Wellington in the <lb/>
Peninsular campaign, and was one of the great general's <lb/>
most trusted officers.</p>
<p>A female ancestor, renowned for her virtues, was <lb/>
Mary Cocks, in whose person the two families named <lb/>
above were first united. It is said of her, "No one <lb/>
throughout life was more beloved; her heart was soon <lb/>
touched with the hearing of distress, and her hand as <lb/>
immediately stretched out to relieve it."</p>
<p>Earl Somers himself is described as "a man of <reg orig="un-|alterable">unalterable</reg> <lb/>
fidelity, of sound judgment, who inherited <lb/>
something of the spirit of adventure which has <reg orig="con-|stantly">constantly</reg> <lb/>
reasserted itself in his family." He was also <lb/>
possessed of &aelig;sthetic tastes, a friend of both Ruskin <lb/>
and Turner, taking an equal delight in exploring the <lb/>
ruins of Asia Minor with the great arch&aelig;ologist, Sir <lb/>
Henry Layard, or in rummaging Italian palaces or old <lb/>
curiosity shops for forgotten treasures of modern art. <lb/>
The result of the former kind of expedition now enriches <lb/>
the British Museum, while the spoils of the latter grace <lb/>
Eastnor Castle, Lady Henry's stately Herefordshire home.</p>
<p>The Countess Somers, Lady Isabel's mother, was a <lb/>
Miss Virginia Pattle, daughter of a director of the East <lb/>
India Company, and his charming French wife, who <lb/>
was descended from the Chevalier de L'Etang, a victim <lb/>
of the Revolution. It is thought by some that much <lb/>
of Lady Henry's cleverness and vivacity, with her dark, <lb/>
animated style of beauty, may be owing to her share of <lb/>
French blood.</p>
<pb n="40" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0211"/>
<p>Concerning the union of the late Earl and Countess <lb/>
a romantic story is told. When Mr. Watts, the <reg orig="cele-|brated">celebrated</reg> <lb/>
Royal Academician, was quite young, he painted <lb/>
a portrait of the beautiful Miss Virginia Pattle, which <lb/>
adorned the walls of the Academy, and became one of <lb/>
the most popular pictures of the year.</p>
<p>Among the thousands who crowded to Burlington <lb/>
House and lingered before the fascinating portrait was <lb/>
young Viscount Eastnor, who was much attracted by <lb/>
the beauty of the picture.</p>
<p>Strange to say, on the very next day the young <lb/>
nobleman was introduced at a fashionable reception <lb/>
to the original of the picture which had charmed him, <lb/>
and so far from being disenchanted by a vision of the <lb/>
reality he fell deeply in love with her. His eager suit <lb/>
was successful; within a few months Miss Virginia <lb/>
Pattle had become Viscountess Eastnor. A year later <lb/>
the subject of our sketch was born.</p>
<p>Lord Somers took great interest in the education of <lb/>
his two daughters. From childhood Lady Isabel spoke <lb/>
fluently the language of her maternal ancestors, and was <lb/>
also familiar with Italian and German. Both she and her <lb/>
sister, Lady Adeline, were uncommonly intellectual and <lb/>
independent-minded girls. Lady Isabel was a great <lb/>
reader. She was very fond of history and essays, and <lb/>
learned Macaulay almost by heart, which may have <lb/>
done much to mould her own graceful and eloquent <lb/>
style of diction. She also devoured the writings of <lb/>
John Stuart Mill, carrying such works as the <hi rend="italic">Subjection <lb/>
of Women</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Essay on Liberty</hi> to read in the <lb/>
privacy of the woods, fearing that, if discovered, they <lb/>
might be forbidden. But her favourite book, she told <lb/>
a recent interviewer, was <hi rend="italic">Uncle Tom's Cabin</hi>, and so <lb/>
strong an impression had the sorrows of the slaves <lb/>
<pb n="41" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0212"/>
there depicted made upon both Lady Isabel and her <lb/>
sister that they divided the book into two halves, in <lb/>
order that both might devour at once this classic of <lb/>
reform.</p>
<p>For the rest, Lady Isabel was always fond as now <lb/>
of healthful out-of-door exercise. Bicycles were not <lb/>
dreamed of for ladies in her girlhood, but she loved to <lb/>
be on horseback, and joined, we are told, "in all active <lb/>
country pursuits, excepting one&mdash;she could never bear <lb/>
to kill beast or bird."</p>
<p>One year after her presentation at Court, Lady Isabel <lb/>
married Lord Henry Somerset, second son of the Duke <lb/>
of Beaufort. On the wedding day Alfred Tennyson <lb/>
sent the bride a basket of snowdrops which he had <lb/>
gathered for her with his own hands.</p>
<p>In 1874 Lady Henry's only child was born, and after <lb/>
a few sorrowful years events separated her from her <lb/>
husband, and the law courts gave the mother the custody <lb/>
of her son.</p>

WIDENING SYMPATHIES.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Sorrow</hi> and suffering brought with them a <reg orig="quick-|ened">quickened</reg> <lb/>
sympathy for others' needs. One of the <reg orig="ser-|vants">servants</reg> <lb/>
declares that she first saw Lady Henry "lighting <lb/>
a fire in my mother's empty hearth in a London slum," <lb/>
and there are many ready to relate how day after day <lb/>
Lady Henry would visit in her district carrying food and <lb/>
clothing at all hours, and herself nursing cases of <reg orig="sick-|ness">sickness</reg> <lb/>
in the very poorest streets of London. But with <lb/>
the great trouble of her life came the change of abode. <lb/>
For some years before her father's death she lived at the <lb/>
<pb n="42" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0213"/>
Priory, Reigate, where the deepest religious convictions <lb/>
of her life came to her with such force that she <reg orig="deter-|mined">determined</reg> <lb/>
from that hour to dedicate her time to the service <lb/>
of humanity. On the death of Lord Somers she took <lb/>
up her residence with her boy, still a young child, at <lb/>
Eastnor Castle.</p>
<figure id="f38" rend="block" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0213">
<head>EASTNOR CASTLE, FRONT VIEW.</head>
</figure>
<p>This stately and magnificent, though not ancient <lb/>
pile, stands in the midst of beautiful scenery at the <lb/>
foot of the Malvern Hills. It is bosomed in trees, <lb/>
and overlooks a lovely miniature lake. "The view from <lb/>
the terrace &hellip; is like a scene in fairyland. As the <lb/>
swan sails stately across the mere, making long ripples <lb/>
across the glassy water in which the foliage of a hundred <lb/>
<pb n="43" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0214"/>
trees is reflected as in a burnished mirror, you seem to <lb/>
be transported to the region which the bards of chivalry <lb/>
have made their own. Ariosto dreamed of nothing <lb/>
more lovely than this combination of wood and water, <lb/>
of the great green slope of the mountain on which the <lb/>
<figure id="f39" rend="block" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0214">
<head>EASTNOR CASTLE, FROM THE LAKE.</head>
</figure>
deer are browsing, and the lofty turrets and loftier keep <lb/>
which form the background to a perfect picture."</p>
<p>The late Frances Willard said that her friend's <reg orig="beauti-|ful">beautiful</reg> <lb/>
home often reminded her of Byron's lines&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"More wondrous spots may rise, more glaring shine,</l>
<l>But none unite in one attracting maze</l>
<l>The splendid, fair, and soft, the glory of old days."</l>
</lg></q></p>
<pb n="44" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0215"/>
<p>But, alas! even this earthly paradise was not free <lb/>
from the "trail of the serpent." Situated in a cider <lb/>
district, Lady Henry soon found that the villagers <lb/>
believed the fermented juice of the apple to be a <reg orig="harm-|less">harmless</reg> <lb/>
drink, and that the effects of this error were <lb/>
disastrous.</p>
<p>Being very anxious that her tenantry should join a <lb/>
temperance society that was formed soon after she had <lb/>
taken up her abode at Eastnor, she herself spoke at one <lb/>
of the meetings, and, what was possibly still more <lb/>
effective, personally signed the pledge in the presence of <lb/>
the audience. Many more signatures were the result <lb/>
of her good example. This was Lady Henry's first essay <lb/>
at public speaking, and her earliest effort at temperance <lb/>
work.</p>
<p>It may be here remarked that she has never since <lb/>
had cause to regret, for her own health's sake, the step <lb/>
she then took. After over ten years' trial she <reg orig="ex-|pressed">expressed</reg> <lb/>
herself more than ever thankful that she was an <lb/>
abstainer. "The tax on the nerves" &lpar;of public <reg orig="speak-|ing&rpar;">speaking&rpar;</reg>, <lb/>
she told an interviewer, "is very great, and I can <lb/>
fully understand what a temptation it must be to women <lb/>
who are engaged in severe mental labour to give <reg orig="them-|selves">themselves</reg> <lb/>
a false strength by means of stimulants. It is <lb/>
infinitely better to depend upon rest and recreation, and <lb/>
that is why it is so important to encourage women to <lb/>
take up active amusements."</p>
<p>Having thus made a start, Lady Henry followed <lb/>
it up by giving Bible-readings in the kitchen of a farm <lb/>
near the Castle, and holding a mothers' meeting in her <lb/>
own dining-room. She also erected iron mission halls <lb/>
in several neglected villages in the neighbourhood, and <lb/>
provided for resident and visiting evangelists.</p>
<p>By degrees Lady Henry's fame as an earnest <lb/>
<pb n="45" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0216"/>
advocate of temperance and an effective speaker began <lb/>
to spread. She was invited to give addresses in the <lb/>
towns and villages round about. Possessed of a <lb/>
naturally rich and sweet voice, she trained herself to <lb/>
making it distinctly heard in every part of halls of <lb/>
varying size by stationing her maid in the gallery, or <lb/>
the back seats of the body of the building, with <lb/>
instructions to raise her handkerchief whenever her <lb/>
mistress's speech became inaudible. But like many <lb/>
another successful orator, especially among women, <lb/>
Lady Henry had to conquer much natural shrinking <lb/>
and shyness, and she has said that in the earlier days of <lb/>
her public work the effort to stand before an audience <lb/>
amounted to acute physical suffering.</p>
<p>As Lady Henry's sphere of work and popularity <lb/>
widened, she became more and more convinced that <lb/>
the dissemination of the principles of total abstinence <lb/>
was her mission, and eagerly gave herself up to it, <lb/>
adopting the most modern basis for her arguments.</p>
<p>"Until ten years ago," she lately told a writer for <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">The Sunday Magazine</hi>, "this was thought to be a <lb/>
question only for the uneducated. &hellip; The aim of the <lb/>
earlier reformers was simply to reduce drunkenness, <lb/>
but now this object has been combined with something <lb/>
wider. &hellip; Scientific study has proved that alcohol has <lb/>
a deleterious effect upon the brain; and as in these <lb/>
days of competition the value of the brain is more and <lb/>
more recognised by every individual worker, we begin to <lb/>
understand more clearly the danger of poisoning the <lb/>
brain with alcohol or narcotics. The abstainer no longer <lb/>
denies himself merely for the sake of example, he <lb/>
recognises that the question is one of vital importance <lb/>
for his own physical and moral well-being. I have <lb/>
never followed in the line of some temperance advocates <lb/>
<pb n="46" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0217"/>
that the moderate drinker is doing a deliberate wrong. <lb/>
The question, to my mind, takes a much higher <reg orig="signifi-|cance">significance</reg>. <lb/>
How are we to keep ourselves most fit for the <lb/>
work of life? Must it not be by avoiding anything and <lb/>
everything that would lessen our efficiency?"</p>
<p>In the course of a few years Lady Henry had <lb/>
travelled nearly 15,000 miles, and visited and worked <lb/>
in not fewer than two hundred villages and cities of <lb/>
Great Britain. On these tours she not infrequently <lb/>
found herself lodgings with some working man's family, <lb/>
and lived as one of themselves. By this means she <lb/>
gained much knowledge of the privations and <reg orig="tempta-|tions">temptations</reg> <lb/>
of the toiling classes, and became convinced that <lb/>
insufficient food, bad air, and dreary surroundings are <lb/>
among the chief causes that lie at the root of <reg orig="drunken-|ness">drunkenness</reg>, <lb/>
especially in the case of women. In this respect <lb/>
she considers that the lot of our working man's wife <lb/>
compares unfavourably with that of the same class <lb/>
in France, Germany, Belgium, or Switzerland. <reg orig="Health-|ful">Healthful</reg> <lb/>
recreation, especially out-of-door amusements, she <lb/>
believes to be a great preventive of that desire for <lb/>
the relief of dulness and monotony which tempts to the <lb/>
temporary excitement afforded by drink.</p>
<p>Nowhere was Lady Henry more cordially received <lb/>
than in the grimy coaling districts of Wales. She went <lb/>
down into the pits and held meetings with the men in <lb/>
their dinner hour. We are not surprised to read that <lb/>
the tears would often run down their faces as she spoke, <lb/>
and that the men "seemed as little children in their <lb/>
gentle eagerness to show their appreciation and love <lb/>
in return for her intense desire for their betterment <lb/>
morally and spiritually."</p>
<p>In 1890 Lady Henry was persuaded to accept the <lb/>
position of President of the British Women's <reg orig="Temper-|ance">Temperance</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="47" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0218"/>
Association, as the successor of Mrs. Margaret <lb/>
Bright Lucas, the sister of John Bright. This has since <lb/>
become the largest and most influential society of its <lb/>
kind in England.</p>
<p>It was not very long after Lady Henry Somerset <lb/>
heard and responded to the Divine Voice that she began <lb/>
to feel her heart drawn to her national kinsfolk across the <lb/>
Atlantic, and to one individual in particular.</p>
<p>It was her ladyship's custom at that time to go down <lb/>
to her housekeeper's room at the Castle for tea and a <lb/>
chat on Sunday afternoons. This good woman <reg orig="con-|ducted">conducted</reg> <lb/>
a mothers' meeting for Lady Henry in the <lb/>
village, and they would discuss together the affairs and <lb/>
needs of the people.</p>
<p>One rainy Sunday, when the usual visit was paid, <lb/>
Lady Henry's attention was attracted to a little blue <lb/>
book lying on the housekeeper's table, with the <reg orig="fas-|cinating">fascinating</reg> <lb/>
title of <hi rend="italic">Nineteen Beautiful Years</hi>. This, as <lb/>
most of our readers know, was Frances Willard's <lb/>
charming memoir of her sweet young sister Mary, who <lb/>
died in her girlhood. Lady Henry sat down by the <lb/>
fire with this book, and never laid it aside till she had <lb/>
finished it. An intense interest in the writer had taken <lb/>
possession of her; to quote her own words, "The <lb/>
simplicity, the quaint candour, and the delicate touches <lb/>
of humour and pathos were a revelation to me of a <lb/>
character that remained on my mind as belonging to <lb/>
one whom I placed in a niche among the ideal lives <lb/>
of whom I hoped to know more, and at whose shrines <lb/>
I worshipped."</p>
<p>Lady Henry had already become acquainted with <lb/>
the American Quaker preacher, Mrs. Hannah <reg orig="Whitall-|Smith">Whitall-Smith</reg>, <lb/>
who was a great friend of Miss Willard, and <lb/>
she was indebted for help in her time of perplexity to <lb/>
<pb n="48" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0219"/>
the former lady's popular little book, <hi rend="italic">The Christian's <lb/>
Secret of a Happy Life;</hi> and when, in 1891, she was <lb/>
invited to America by the National Women's Christian <lb/>
Temperance Union, she went, she confesses, "as much <lb/>
to see and know Miss Willard as for any other purpose."</p>
<p>They were introduced to one another by Mrs. <lb/>
Whitall-Smith. The Englishwoman paid a delightful <lb/>
visit to Miss Willard's simple little home at Evanston, <lb/>
and won from the aged mother the spontaneous tribute <lb/>
that "Lady Henry has the unobtrusiveness of perfect <lb/>
culture; she shall be loved always for her sweet ways."</p>
<p>The close and tender friendship then begun grew and <lb/>
flourished, a joy and mutual help, until it was ended for <lb/>
this world all too soon by the death of Frances Willard <lb/>
early in 1898.</p>
<p>Lady Henry's visit to America was a brilliant success. <lb/>
"No one born outside the United States since the days <lb/>
of Lafayette ever received so enthusiastic a welcome." <lb/>
She attended the W.W.C.T.U. Convention in Boston, <lb/>
which represented through its delegates more than ten <lb/>
thousand local societies, and half a million women from <lb/>
all parts of Christendom, and she was made its <reg orig="vice-|president">vice-president</reg>. <lb/>
She also spoke in Chicago, Baltimore, <reg orig="Phila-|delphia">Philadelphia</reg>, <lb/>
and Washington. She went to Minneapolis to <lb/>
help Mr. John Woolley establish the Rest Island Mission <lb/>
for intemperate men. In four days' work at the twin <lb/>
cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul she spoke seven <lb/>
times, the public Press of that locality and the people <lb/>
uniting in the warmest expressions of appreciation.</p>
<p>An ardent English admirer has declared that "our <lb/>
American kinsfolk were the first to discover her genius, <lb/>
capacity, and charm, and their recognition did much <lb/>
to pave the way for her success in this country on her <lb/>
return." No doubt Lady Henry's simplicity, and that <lb/>
<pb n="49" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0220"/>
same "utter absence of self-consciousness or pride" <lb/>
which she declares to have been the secret of her <lb/>
father's popularity, was what took democratic America <lb/>
by storm.</p>
<p>Lady Henry spoke for the White Ribboners in all <lb/>
the leading cities of the United States, the white ribbon <lb/>
there being the temperance badge as the blue has been <lb/>
with us; the colour was emblematic of purity and <lb/>
peace, on the principle of "first pure, then peaceable." <lb/>
The greatest halls were crowded wherever she was <lb/>
announced to speak, and the overflow of those unable <lb/>
to get in blocked the streets and stopped the tramcars. <lb/>
The newspapers all over America were unanimous in <lb/>
her praise; not one dissentient voice was raised. "What <lb/>
with public meetings, private receptions, interviews, <lb/>
journalism, and studying, Lady Henry may be said to <lb/>
have succeeded in acclimatising herself as an American <lb/>
more completely and more rapidly than any other <lb/>
English noble has ever done before."</p>
<p>She visited Chicago, living unobtrusively in lodgings, <lb/>
and while there took the opportunity of attending <lb/>
Mr. Moody's Training School for Christian Workers. <lb/>
She also gained valuable journalistic experience by <lb/>
helping Miss Willard to edit <hi rend="italic">The Union Signal</hi> during <lb/>
the temporary absence on vacation of Miss Mary Allen <lb/>
West. <hi rend="italic">The Union Signal</hi> was said by Miss Willard <lb/>
to be "the most notable journal ever owned, edited, and <lb/>
published by womankind."</p>
<p>Lady Henry also made the acquaintance of America's <lb/>
two greatest poets at that time living&mdash;John Greenleaf <lb/>
Whittier and Oliver Wendell Holmes&mdash;as well as <lb/>
other notable folk, and had her task been less arduous <lb/>
or her earnestness not so great, she might easily have <lb/>
spent her whole time in enjoying and being <hi rend="italic">f&otilde;ted</hi> by the <lb/>
<pb n="50" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0221"/>
best American society. But she was there chiefly to <lb/>
work and to learn, which she zealously did.</p>
<p>In April, 1892, Lady Henry returned to England, <lb/>
having spent six months on the other side of the <lb/>
Atlantic. Her work was awaiting her at home in <lb/>
connection with the Liberal Election Campaign, with <lb/>
which the interests of temperance had become identified. <lb/>
In this cause she gave thirty-six addresses in fourteen <lb/>
days.</p>
<p>Lady Henry is in the front rank on the question <lb/>
of Woman's Suffrage. In a recent interview with Mr. <lb/>
Raymond Blathwayt she said, "I would wish to see <lb/>
women as voters, as doctors, and lawyers. &hellip; I would <lb/>
wish to see women as guardians of the poor, police <lb/>
matrons, ladies' doctors. The County Council, in <reg orig="elimi-|nating">eliminating</reg> <lb/>
the feminine element, have excluded the most <lb/>
valuable element they could possibly have had. Who <lb/>
could deal better with the homes of the poor than <lb/>
women? Who could so thoroughly cleanse the slums? <lb/>
I would ever maintain that women in Parliament, if such <lb/>
a time should ever come, would deal with these questions <lb/>
from the mother's point of view, the point of view from <lb/>
which every right-minded woman, married or single, <lb/>
regards the whole of life."</p>
<p>In the autumn of that year Lady Henry again went <lb/>
to America, visiting Denver and Colorado and <reg orig="partici-|pating">participating</reg> <lb/>
in the annual meeting of the National Women's <lb/>
Christian Temperance Union. She was much struck <lb/>
with the universal education of American women, and <lb/>
considers them a long way ahead of the majority of our <lb/>
countrywomen. She also approves of the American <lb/>
plan of educating boys and girls together. She thinks <lb/>
that it encourages more mutual trust between the <lb/>
sexes. She holds that it is bad for a lad to be <lb/>
<pb n="51" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0222"/>
separated from women's influence, as he is at a big <lb/>
public school, during the most formative period of his <lb/>
growth; moreover, that "a woman with a high standard <lb/>
of life proves that standard better in liberty than in <lb/>
captivity."</p>
<p>Returning to England immediately after the N.W. <lb/>
C.T.U. meeting, Lady Henry settled down once more <lb/>
to home work. Writing of her at this time, a visitor to <lb/>
her home says: "She gathered a pleasant circle about <lb/>
her for her son's sake, &hellip; always the leader in that <lb/>
bright, piquant conversation so delightful to the young," <lb/>
driving, cycling, tending the wants of the cottagers <lb/>
round Eastnor, and "when night falls, and the Castle <lb/>
bell is heard summoning the family to the chapel, <lb/>
Lady Henry is always in her place at the evening <lb/>
devotions."</p>
<p>In 1893 Lady Henry undertook the part editorship <lb/>
of <hi rend="italic">The Woman's Herald</hi>, as one of the organs of <lb/>
the W.W.C.T.U., and later on established and for two <lb/>
years edited <hi rend="italic">The Woman's Signal;</hi> she has also written <lb/>
leaflets on women's work, magazine articles, and a <lb/>
volume of short stories, entitled <hi rend="italic">Studies in Black and <lb/>
White</hi>. She is, in addition, remarkably gifted as a <lb/>
water-colourist, her father and her father's cousin, the <lb/>
Marchioness of Waterford, being among the finest <lb/>
amateur artists England has ever produced.</p>

SISTERS OF CHARITY.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">For</hi> several years, from 1893 onwards, Lady Henry <lb/>
enjoyed an annual visit from Frances Willard, to <lb/>
whom she showed herself a charming hostess. The two <lb/>
<pb n="52" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0223"/>
women formed "a very strong combination, as <reg orig="remark-|able">remarkable</reg> <lb/>
for its contrasts as its resemblances," and they <lb/>
loved one another as sisters.</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1896, during one of Miss Willard's <lb/>
brief visits to Europe, she and Lady Henry planned a <lb/>
bicycling tour in Normandy. They started on their <lb/>
expedition, but at Rouen they came across a copy of <lb/>
the English <hi rend="italic">Daily News</hi>, and in that paper there was <lb/>
an appeal made by their French correspondent to the <lb/>
sympathies of the English for the pitiful condition of <lb/>
the Armenians, who were arriving by shiploads at <reg orig="Mar-|seilles">Marseilles</reg>, <lb/>
starving, destitute, and homeless. Miss Willard <lb/>
and Lady Henry Somerset determined to abandon their <lb/>
expedition, and to start at once to endeavour in some <lb/>
measure to alleviate the sufferings of that persecuted <lb/>
race, who were seeking protection on Christian shores. <lb/>
Reaching Marseilles, they found that the description <lb/>
had not been exaggerated. Before nightfall on the <lb/>
day of their arrival they had gone to the <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italic">asile des <lb/>
pauvres</hi></foreign>, and there they saw for themselves the sad sight <lb/>
of groups of Armenians&mdash;men, women, and children&mdash; <lb/>
huddled together, waiting for the morning, without food, <lb/>
and with just the roof over their heads accorded to <lb/>
them by the charity of the nation to whom they had <lb/>
fled for refuge. That very night the American and <lb/>
Englishwoman went out into the streets of the town <lb/>
with two dark-faced Armenians, and bought <reg orig="baskets-|full">baskets-full</reg> <lb/>
of bread and grapes and figs, and carried them <lb/>
back to the hungry folk, with interpreted assurances <lb/>
that before morning they should be better housed. <lb/>
The next day found them going from <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italic">sous pr&eacute;fet</hi></foreign> to <lb/>
<foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italic">pr&eacute;fet</hi></foreign> appealing to all the powers of the city <reg orig="govern-|ment">government</reg>, <lb/>
and at last Lady Henry obtained permission <lb/>
to shelter the Armenians in a great disused hospital, <lb/>
<pb n="53" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0224"/>
an abandoned monastery, which had not been inhabited <lb/>
since the time of the great outbreak of cholera in <reg orig="Mar-|seilles">Marseilles</reg>, <lb/>
some thirty or forty years before. This building <lb/>
was in fair order, although the weeds grew rank in the <lb/>
cloisters. The shutters had not been unclosed for years, <lb/>
and the dust of ages had settled on the floors; but by <lb/>
the help of a few strong and athletic young men, and <lb/>
sundry pails of water and brooms, the orders given by <lb/>
signs were carried out, and some of the rooms were <lb/>
made habitable. Into these the starving folk poured, <lb/>
eagerly gathering themselves in the corners according <lb/>
to families, spreading out a few rugs they had brought <lb/>
with them, and settling themselves with that patient <lb/>
submission which characterises the Oriental races. The <lb/>
good old Armenian priest arranged one of the rooms <lb/>
in the monastery as a chapel, and Lady Henry has <lb/>
often said that she has never witnessed a more touching <lb/>
sight than when these persecuted people assembled <lb/>
there to pray, for there seemed to be a reality, that we <lb/>
rarely find in this nineteenth century, in the worship <lb/>
of those who had been ready to sacrifice all for the <lb/>
cross of Christ. Sad indeed were the tales that they <lb/>
gathered: the mothers who had seen their children <lb/>
killed before their eyes, the women who had been <lb/>
made widows and had fled with their little ones, the <lb/>
men who, under their breath, told the story of the <lb/>
terrible end of the wives they loved. By degrees <lb/>
money was collected, for Miss Willard spent many <lb/>
hours every day writing and cabling to rich American <lb/>
friends, and to many benevolent people in England, <lb/>
until a sufficient sum was collected to send all the poor <lb/>
outcasts to the hospitable shores of the New World. <lb/>
For several days Lady Henry and Miss Willard sat at <lb/>
tables, at "the receipt of custom" as they laughingly <lb/>
<pb n="54" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0225"/>
called it, doling out the money for the tickets and the <lb/>
necessary sums which, by the laws of the United States, <lb/>
each emigrant was required to possess on landing. <lb/>
After a while all was ready, and between three and <lb/>
four hundred people were prepared to start. Many <lb/>
difficulties attended their arrival; but, finally, by dint <lb/>
of perseverance and a dogged determination that these <lb/>
persecuted Christians should not be baulked of a home, <lb/>
they were allowed to land upon the shores of America; <lb/>
and Lady Henry has assured those who have repeatedly <lb/>
asked her for news of the emigrants that on all hands <lb/>
she has heard that most of them are doing well, and <lb/>
have proved intelligent, capable, and industrious citizens. <lb/>
The strain, however, of the work was so great that Miss <lb/>
Willard completely broke down in health, and this was <lb/>
the last visit she paid to Europe, as she returned to <lb/>
America in November, 1896, overworn and overtaxed <lb/>
by the work she had undertaken.</p>
<p>Lady Henry has often stated that the hours of the <lb/>
last night in the old convent at Marseilles were <lb/>
some of the most affecting that she has ever <reg orig="experi-|enced">experienced</reg> <lb/>
in her work. "They stood," she said, "in rows <lb/>
in the gathering gloom in the little chapel, and the <lb/>
tears poured down the cheeks of men and women as, <lb/>
one by one, they first kissed the cross held aloft by the <lb/>
priest and then came and kissed our hands and blessed <lb/>
us, and we felt that that blessing was not only the <reg orig="ex-|pression">expression</reg> <lb/>
of the gratitude of homeless Christians, but it <lb/>
was the benediction of God Himself, and humbly and <lb/>
gratefully we received it gladly."</p>
<p>As the outcome of this work Miss Willard gathered <lb/>
sufficient money on her return to America to provide, <lb/>
for three years, for a hundred orphans in an Armenian <lb/>
school which had been established there.</p>
<pb n="55" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0226"/>
<p>It was a great blow to Lady Henry, and one from <lb/>
which she was long in recovering, when, in the <reg orig="begin-|ning">beginning</reg> <lb/>
of 1898, she lost her new-found friend, and we are <lb/>
sure that it was to her a most sorrowful distinction <lb/>
when she was called upon to succeed Miss Willard as <lb/>
President of the World's Women's Christian <reg orig="Temper-|ance">Temperance</reg> <lb/>
Union.</p>

<div2 type="chapter" n="IV" id="d49">
<head><hi rend="bold">CHAPTER IV. <lb/>
A HOME OF HOPE.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Probably</hi> the work which will be most memorably <lb/>
connected with the name of Lady Henry Somerset <lb/>
is the founding of the Home for Inebriates at Duxhurst.</p>
<p>Among the chief causes of female drunkenness she, <lb/>
as we have already noted, believes to be "insufficient <lb/>
food, bad air, and dreary surroundings"; and she <reg orig="con-|siders">considers</reg> <lb/>
that temperance workers too often ignore those <lb/>
facts.</p>
<p>In 1895 the British Women's Temperance <reg orig="Associa-|tion">Association</reg> <lb/>
undertook, with Lady Henry's superintendence, the <lb/>
founding of a Home for Female Inebriates, where their <lb/>
vice would be regarded as a physical as much as a moral <lb/>
disease, and treated accordingly.</p>
<p>"The Duxhurst Home," to quote her ladyship's own <lb/>
description of the institution when conversing on the <lb/>
subject with Miss Jane T. Stoddart, a representative of <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">The Sunday Magazine</hi>, "is about five miles from Reigate, <lb/>
and is charmingly situated among the hills and woods <lb/>
of Surrey. The model village consists of a group of <lb/>
six pretty cottages; a larger house contains a <reg orig="dining-|hall">dining-hall</reg>, <lb/>
recreation-hall, general kitchens, bathrooms, chapel, <lb/>
and hospital, all grouped together. By the cottage <lb/>
system we have endeavoured to preserve in these <lb/>
<pb n="56" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0227"/>
women a love of home, and we find that the little <lb/>
routine of everyday labour, as well as the outdoor <lb/>
work provided for them, has a beneficial effect on both <lb/>
body and mind.</p>
<p>"The first aim of our work is to restore the lost <lb/>
feeling of self-respect, and we can do this better in <lb/>
cottage life than in any institution. Each cottage <reg orig="con-|tains">contains</reg> <lb/>
six patients, and is supervised by a nurse-sister, <lb/>
who is under the nurse-superintendent, in whose charge <lb/>
the whole colony is placed."</p>
<p>The cottages, named respectively the "Massingberd," <lb/>
the "Agnes Weston," the "Margaret Bright Lucas," the <lb/>
"Isabel," the "Birmingham," and the "Derby," after <lb/>
individual or collective donors, are neat in design, with <lb/>
gable ends, and a bay-window in each; they are cosily <lb/>
thatched, and stand around the tiny, three-cornered <lb/>
village-green&mdash;"a breezy, upland farm," on a hill-slope, <lb/>
and "overlooking beautiful plains that stretch away for <lb/>
miles on either side." Lady Henry has great faith in <lb/>
the fresh, bracing air and the scent of the pine-woods as <lb/>
remedial agents.</p>
<p>Out-of-door occupations are encouraged as much as <lb/>
possible; standing behind a wash-tub is not supposed <lb/>
to be the only work appropriate to the reclaiming of <lb/>
women. The patients cultivate flowers, both in pots and <lb/>
open beds, they care for the vegetable garden and the <lb/>
forcing-houses, and keep in order the lawns, about an <lb/>
acre in extent, with light, hand-mowing machines. Fruit <lb/>
is also grown, and the women do a large share of the <lb/>
picking and packing of it; in a 300-foot glass-house <lb/>
good crops of tomatoes are raised, all the pruning and <lb/>
picking of which is done by the women; smilax, so <lb/>
much used for table decorations, is also cultivated, and <lb/>
this needs careful training and watching; there is also <lb/>

<head>SOME OF THE COTTAGES AT DUXHURST, REIGATE.</head>
</figure>
<pb entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0229"/>
<pb n="59" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0230"/>
dairy work to do, and poultry to tend, and the beehives <lb/>
have proved the most successful venture of all. Lady <lb/>
Henry testifies that she has known cases in which, after <lb/>
six weeks of these healthful and pleasant occupations, a <lb/>
woman has improved so wonderfully that no one would <lb/>
have believed she was a patient.</p>
<p>Of course the inmates are not all strong enough for <lb/>
labour of this kind, and for such as are not able to <lb/>
undertake the gardening, indoor work is provided. <lb/>
Needlework and all kinds of mending are of course <lb/>
taught; a loom has also been started, in which fancy <lb/>
aprons, dress materials, etc., can be produced, and a <lb/>
knitting machine, from which many warm articles are <lb/>
constantly being turned out. Needless to say, each <lb/>
patient keeps her own little lodging bright and clean, <lb/>
and they take great pride in doing so. Jam-making in <lb/>
the fruit season also provides another variety of <reg orig="occupa-|tion">occupation</reg>, <lb/>
and each inmate is expected to do her share of the <lb/>
necessary laundry work of the colony.</p>
<p>In a meadow facing the village stands a long building <lb/>
called "The Nest." Here children from the slums come <lb/>
for holidays of a fortnight long all through the summer, <lb/>
and even young babies are received in the hope that the <lb/>
fresh air and healthy surroundings may do something <lb/>
to counteract any inherited taint.</p>
<p>From an interesting article in <hi rend="italic">The Churchwoman</hi>, <lb/>
whence we have obtained a good deal of the information <lb/>
given above, we also glean the satisfactory assurance <lb/>
that of the women who have spent a year in the colony <lb/>
&mdash;Lady Henry having little faith in the efficacy of short <lb/>
periods of abstinence&mdash;about 67 per cent. are doing <lb/>
well. The sisters in charge often receive most <reg orig="touch-|ing">touching</reg> <lb/>
letters from former patients, in which they speak <lb/>
thankfully of temptations resisted, while husbands write <lb/>
<pb n="60" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0231"/>
to express their joy and gratitude at all that has been <lb/>
done, and done so successfully, to restore their wives to <lb/>
their former and better selves. Those who have <reg orig="ex-|perienced">experienced</reg> <lb/>
the benefits of the Home will also bring <lb/>
friends, afflicted as they once were, down to Duxhurst <lb/>
at their own expense, and beg for their admittance into <lb/>
the colony.</p>
<p>As each cottage accommodates six patients in addition <lb/>
to those for whom hospital treatment is necessary, it <lb/>
will be seen that from forty to fifty inmates can be <lb/>
received at a time. There is also, some little distance <lb/>
from the colony, a superior residence, called the Manor <lb/>
House, where patients of a different social standing can <lb/>
be received on payment of higher fees, varying <reg orig="accord-|ing">according</reg> <lb/>
to their circumstances and the treatment required. <lb/>
This house has a large garden and private grounds, with <lb/>
tennis courts and facilities for bicycling.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we may observe that the lady about <lb/>
whom we have been writing is as attractive in her <lb/>
appearance as in her manners, and is always <reg orig="well-|dressed">well-dressed</reg>. <lb/>
She says, "Women cannot be too careful in <lb/>
this respect. If they" &lpar;public women&rpar; "wear ugly <lb/>
clothes, they are positively hindering the cause they <lb/>
wish to help. How often one has heard a young girl <lb/>
say, 'If I must look like so-and-so, I would rather keep <lb/>
out of the work altogether!' The beautiful is a part of <lb/>
life, and should enter into our homes, our persons, and <lb/>
our surroundings. By giving due care to these outward <lb/>
things, we provide a real pleasure for others."</p>
<p>The late Frances Willard thus described her friend <lb/>
for the benefit of <hi rend="italic">The Young Woman:</hi> "A lady in the <lb/>
early prime of life, of figure inclined to <hi rend="italic">embonpoint</hi>, <lb/>
clad in a becoming but unpretentious gown, on which <lb/>
she wears the little bow of white ribbon, emblem <lb/>
<pb n="61" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0232"/>
of the Women's Temperance movement to which she is <lb/>
devoted. A noble, well-set head, carried with gentle <lb/>
dignity, dark hair that turns to chestnut in the sunshine, <lb/>
simply coiled and waved above a low, broad, thoughtful <lb/>
forehead; arching brows that betoken great sensibility <lb/>
and genuineness of character; eyes sometimes dark <lb/>
brown, at others chestnut, roguish, pathetic, eloquent, <lb/>
according to the impulse or situation of the hour; cheeks <lb/>
with the English flush of health or exercise; a nose not <lb/>
Roman, but determined; lips whose smile is a reflection <lb/>
of the bright kindness of her eyes&mdash;a face, indeed, full <lb/>
of the charm of intellect, culture, and goodwill&mdash;this is <lb/>
'Lady Henry Somerset at home.'"</p>
<p>To this we may add the testimony of a lady <reg orig="inter-|viewer">interviewer</reg>, <lb/>
that "as one watches her at work in the garden, <lb/>
with her faithful collie by her side, or riding merrily <lb/>
along the avenue on her bicycle, it is difficult to realise <lb/>
that she is one of the most eloquent of English public <lb/>
speakers, an orator who can hold the attention of an <lb/>
audience as well as any statesman or preacher of them <lb/>
all. Her manners are perfectly simple and unaffected, <lb/>
and her forgetfulness of self must be apparent to anyone <lb/>
who converses with her."</p>
<p>With the finishing touch from yet another hand, that <lb/>
Lady Henry is gifted with "a sweet voice and a ringing <lb/>
laugh," we think the portrait is complete, and we are <lb/>
ready to agree with the latter writer that she is "a <lb/>
person altogether calculated to win the hearts of her <lb/>
audience to the many and somewhat advanced theories <lb/>
which she delights to enunciate from the many <reg orig="plat-|forms">platforms</reg> <lb/>
on which she is ever a welcome and favourite <lb/>
speaker."</p>
<p>Mr. Somers-Somerset, to whom Lady Henry, <reg orig="not-|withstanding">notwithstanding</reg> <lb/>
her many public duties, has always been a <lb/>
<pb n="62" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0233"/>
most devoted and affectionate mother, is a tall, manly <lb/>
young Englishman who has travelled more miles than <lb/>
most young men of his years, and written and excellent <lb/>
book on his adventures in the far West. He has just <lb/>
returned from South Africa, where he held the post of <lb/>
despatch rider at the front.</p>
<p>Mr. Somerset, in 1896, married the Lady Katherine <lb/>
Beauclerk, daughter of the Duke of St. Albans, and we <lb/>
are sure that all who read these lines will join the writer <lb/>
in the earnest wish that the years may bring to Lady <lb/>
Henry the fullest joy in their happiness, and the fruition <lb/>
of every other hope.</p>

<head><hi rend="bold">CHAPTER I. <lb/>
A CLOUDED CHILDHOOD.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">It</hi> is surely worth something to be born on an <lb/>
auspicious day! Sarah Robinson, the "Soldiers' <lb/>
Friend," first saw the light upon August 1st, 1834, a <lb/>
date for ever glorious as that on which England freed <lb/>
thousands of her West Indian subjects from slavery and <lb/>
herself from the stain of countenancing that grievous <lb/>
wrong. Although laying no claim to be a sentimental <lb/>
person, Miss Robinson says she has always felt glad <lb/>
that she was born on such a day.</p>
<p>Her father, John James Robinson, though of London <lb/>
origin, was for many years the "Squire" of a village in <lb/>
Sussex, nine miles from Lewes, and here the early life <lb/>
of the subject of our sketch was chiefly passed.</p>
<p>She was the fourth child in a family of six, but the <lb/>
third having died in infancy, a gap was created which <lb/>
caused the elder pair to seem a good way removed from <lb/>
the younger ones, and Sarah's chief companions were <lb/>
her two small brothers.</p>
<p>She describes herself as "a pale, big-nosed, <reg orig="dark-|haired">dark-haired</reg>" <lb/>
little girl, who was always asking questions. <lb/>
<pb n="64" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0235"/>
She was delicate in health, reserved, sensitive, and <lb/>
timid, not given to making friends or showing much <lb/>
affectionateness of disposition, though it is plain to <lb/>
those who read the record of her early years that there <lb/>
was a fund of undeveloped tenderness in her heart for <lb/>
which the stern training of her Calvinistic father <reg orig="pro-|vided">provided</reg> <lb/>
no natural outlet.</p>
<p>The type of Christian &lpar;!&rpar; who could have each <lb/>
successive kitten of which his children made a pet <lb/>
systematically slaughtered, and ruthlessly in their <lb/>
absence made away with the brood of rabbits which <lb/>
were their chief delight, lest they should be tempted <lb/>
to <foreign lang="fil"><hi rend="italic">idolatry</hi></foreign>, is, we hope, wholly extinct; but we are <lb/>
not surprised to learn that such training only tended <lb/>
to confirm little Sarah's "dread and hatred of God our <lb/>
Father in heaven," judging Him to be like her earthly <lb/>
father, only infinitely more terrible.</p>
<p>The mother of these children, though described as a <lb/>
"timid, spiritually minded believer &hellip; with an adoring <lb/>
love to the Lord Jesus Christ," does not appear to have <lb/>
had much to spare for her little ones, for they were <lb/>
kissed only as a good-night and good-morning formality, <lb/>
never comforted when they hurt themselves, and never <lb/>
caressed. A weak heart, however, released Mrs. <reg orig="Robin-|son">Robinson</reg> <lb/>
from most of her maternal duties, and the actual <lb/>
freedom the children enjoyed beneath the slight <reg orig="super-|vision">supervision</reg> <lb/>
of servants compensated in some measure for the <lb/>
moral strictness of their bringing up.</p>
<p>The summer days at Heasmonds, as the Robinsons' <lb/>
estate was called, seem to have been happy enough, for <lb/>
Sarah and her two younger brothers wandered about at <lb/>
their own sweet will, often with no sterner guardian <lb/>
than a big, good-natured Newfoundland dog, almost <lb/>
living out-of-doors, eating fruit as they pleased from <lb/>
<pb n="65" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0236"/>
the orchard and strawberry beds, and making <reg orig="them-|selves">themselves</reg> <lb/>
very much at home with the cottagers.</p>
<p>The ignorance and superstition rife among servants <lb/>
and villagers in those days was appalling. After <lb/>
having been well stuffed with tales of ghosts, "warnings," <lb/>
and the fearful judgments overtaking naughty children, <lb/>
poor little Sarah suffered from bad dreams, and was <lb/>
afraid of the dark. But this is not astonishing at a <lb/>
period when a man better educated than many of his <lb/>
contemporaries&mdash;the Robinsons' bailiff, in fact&mdash;nearly <lb/>
killed himself by swallowing "two big hairy spiders" <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">alive</hi> as a cure for ague!</p>
<p>But, after all, as we have said, freedom makes up for <lb/>
much. The three children, who do not appear to have <lb/>
been troubled by a great deal of lesson-learning, romped <lb/>
to their hearts' content in wood or field, garden or <lb/>
shrubbery; they had swings and shady arbours for the <lb/>
hottest days; they were allowed feasts of plain cake and <lb/>
home-made ginger-beer out-of-doors; they visited oast, <lb/>
flour-mill, and village pottery, watching every process <lb/>
and learning what everything was made of and how it <lb/>
was made, in much pleasanter fashion than by the dull <lb/>
"<hi rend="italic">Q</hi>." and "<hi rend="italic">A</hi>." of the town child's "Guide to <reg orig="Know-|ledge">Knowledge</reg>." <lb/>
They had a gentle, fat pony to ride by turns in <lb/>
their longer walks, but also delighted in bush-harrows, <lb/>
hay-carts, and "the broad, cushiony backs" of the farm <lb/>
horses. And on wet days they played lovely games at <lb/>
being "persecuted Waldenses" in the barns, cattle-sheds, <lb/>
or wood-store.</p>
<p>From an early age Sarah, or Rah, as she best liked to <lb/>
be called, had loved soldiers, as depicted in tales, pictures, <lb/>
and poetry, and her first acquaintance with a live <reg orig="speci-|men">specimen</reg>, <lb/>
though calculated to shatter her ideal, does not seem <lb/>
to have affected her rather strange predilection in the least.</p>
<pb n="66" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0237"/>
<p>This individual appeared before her in the guise of a <lb/>
suffering hero, wounded in war, and neglected by the <lb/>
country in whose cause he had fought and bled. He <lb/>
presented himself at the back door of the Robinsons' <lb/>
wealthy abode; he smelt unheroically of drink, baccy, <lb/>
and dirt, but nothing could divest him of the halo of <lb/>
glory which he wore in little "Missarah's" imaginative <lb/>
eyes.</p>
<p>The adults of the household were not favourably <reg orig="im-|pressed">impressed</reg> <lb/>
with this "old soldier," but in consequence of <lb/>
the child's persistent pleadings he was at length <reg orig="dis-|missed">dismissed</reg> <lb/>
with a parcel of food, a little money, and two <lb/>
cast-off shirts.</p>
<p>This, however, was not enough for Sarah, and she ran <lb/>
after the man all down the long drive to bestow upon <lb/>
him a precious new shilling of her very own. But <lb/>
imagine her chagrin when, next morning, the landlady <lb/>
of the village inn brought back the two shirts, saying <lb/>
that "a drunken tramp" had sold them to her ostler for <lb/>
beer, and seeing them marked with Mr. Robinson's name, <lb/>
she feared they were not honestly obtained!</p>
<p>"Rah's old soldier" was a joke against her for some <lb/>
time, but the child's notion of the heroism of her <lb/>
country's defenders was not lessened.</p>
<p>The next warrior with whom our future "Soldier's <lb/>
Friend" became acquainted was of a very different type. <lb/>
This man had some time previously "gone for a <lb/>
sodger in the Ingees," which, in the neighbourhood of <lb/>
Heasmonds, was held to be much the same thing as <lb/>
"going to the devil" at once. Therefore the report that <lb/>
he had returned on furlough, and had actually been <lb/>
seen taking his sister to church, where she had never <lb/>
been except to get married, seemed almost incredible. <lb/>
And wonder was not lessened when it was also stated <lb/>
<pb n="67" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0238"/>
that out in those same "Ingees" he had been converted <lb/>
to God.</p>
<p>The next sensation in the village was the starting, by <lb/>
this converted soldier, of a prayer and Bible-reading <lb/>
meeting in his sister's cottage, and the sister herself was <lb/>
the first fruit of his efforts. The elder Miss Robinson <lb/>
and a friend attended this meeting on one occasion, <lb/>
rather to the dismay of the earnest-minded but <reg orig="un-|educated">uneducated</reg> <lb/>
young man, and it was kept up after he had <lb/>
rejoined his regiment.</p>
<p>From that time forward Sarah's ideal hero was a <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> soldier, and she read with eager interest every <lb/>
story relating to such which she could find. This was <lb/>
the more remarkable, because religious literature for the <lb/>
young of the then popular kind was abhorrent to her. <lb/>
The only pleasure she ever obtained from the priggish <lb/>
lives and premature deaths of the juvenile saints whose <lb/>
memoirs were presented to her, was the assurance that <lb/>
she personally was wicked enough to be secure from <lb/>
such early decay!</p>
<p>But our heavenly Father ever leads "with cords of <lb/>
a man, with bands of love." Sarah's spontaneous <reg orig="en-|thusiasm">enthusiasm</reg> <lb/>
for military characters induced her to peruse <lb/>
with sympathy and delight the biographies of Christian <lb/>
heroes of the Peninsular War&mdash;Sampson Staniforth, <lb/>
John Haime, John Evans, and others whose names are <lb/>
even less familiar to the present generation; also the <lb/>
lives of Cromwell and his Ironsides. So that, as she tells <lb/>
us, "the impression that soldiers could be and should <lb/>
be 'for God, for Queen, for Country,' deepened within <lb/>
me while as yet I was not on the Lord's side myself."</p>
<p>At the age of ten little Sarah was sent to the <lb/>
boarding-school at Brighton of which her elder sister <lb/>
was already an ornament.</p>
<pb n="68" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0239"/>
<p>Schools of fifty years ago were very different from <lb/>
those of to-day, and it is evident that the child was <lb/>
physically too delicate and mentally too "peculiar" to <lb/>
thrive under the hard-and-fast r&eacute;gime to which the <lb/>
pupils were subjected. She grieved constantly at being <lb/>
torn from her home, and cried herself to sleep night <lb/>
after night with the misery of it.</p>
<p>At the same time, she plainly depicts herself as a <lb/>
thorn in the side of teachers and scholars alike. She <lb/>
spoiled one girl's dress by throwing an ink-bottle at <lb/>
her; she disfigured the spelling-book of another with <lb/>
sketches of imps; she got out upon the school roof to <lb/>
see how the pupils were to escape in case of fire, and <lb/>
scaled the garden wall to find out what was on the <lb/>
other side; she endangered the limbs of her room-mates <lb/>
by introducing the art of casting figures in molten lead, <lb/>
and disgraced the whole Noah's Ark procession in <lb/>
public by slapping the face and smashing the bonnet <lb/>
of one of the elder girls who had annoyed her when <lb/>
walking on Kemp Town Parade!</p>
<p>Sarah Robinson was decidedly <hi rend="italic">not</hi> angelic; perhaps <lb/>
if she had been, she would have been early endowed <lb/>
with wings to fly heavenwards, like the an&aelig;mic darlings <lb/>
for whom she felt such contempt. And it would have <lb/>
made worlds of difference to "Tommy"!</p>
<p>Yet between the lines at this stormy time one still <lb/>
finds evidences of tenderness that make one sorry that <lb/>
the child, whom nobody seemed to take the trouble to <lb/>
understand, could not have been reared in a more <lb/>
genial atmosphere.</p>
<p>The only girl to whom she made advances of <reg orig="friend-|ship">friendship</reg> <lb/>
at this school was a poor orphan, who "never had <lb/>
nice dresses, pocket-money, or 'hampers'"; who was, <lb/>
moreover, "ungainly, ill-favoured, shabby, and too <lb/>
<pb n="69" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0240"/>
stupid to do her lessons; her eyelids always red from <lb/>
many silent tears, scorned by ungenerous rich girls, <lb/>
snubbed by the teachers, lonely and dull."</p>
<p>Such was the girl whom the unsociable Sarah&mdash;"that <lb/>
Sarah Robinson," as she was expressively termed&mdash; <lb/>
made her companion, shared with her her own cakes <lb/>
and goodies, and fought her battles, even to the tearing <lb/>
of a large lock of <hi rend="italic">false</hi> hair from the head of a vain <lb/>
young miss who had been rude to her.</p>
<p>Among the teachers, too, the only one whom Sarah <lb/>
really took pains to please was the young lady who <lb/>
taught French. A serious attack of small-pox had <lb/>
disfigured poor "Ma'amselle's" complexion and hair, <lb/>
and some of the elder girls were unfeeling enough to <lb/>
annoy her because of this misfortune. This again <lb/>
aroused Sarah's championship, and though she hated <lb/>
French she applied herself to it most assiduously as a <lb/>
practical means of comforting the poor teacher, and <lb/>
"even undertook the extra task of translating La <lb/>
Fontaine's <hi rend="italic">Fables</hi> into English <foreign lang="dut"><hi rend="italic">verse</hi></foreign>," which, she says, <lb/>
was much more comic than the original, and often had <lb/>
"morals" of her own appended. She was wont to <lb/>
"hover round Ma'amselle to show goodwill in every <lb/>
possible way," and as the young French teacher was <lb/>
an earnest Christian she breathed many a secret prayer <lb/>
for her turbulent, tender-hearted little friend.</p>
<p>About this time Mrs. Robinson died quite suddenly <lb/>
of the heart affection which had troubled her for so <lb/>
many years. Although no instances of her motherly <lb/>
affection for her children are related, Sarah and her <lb/>
brother next in age to herself appear to have felt their <lb/>
bereavement keenly. The little girl "fairly <hi rend="italic">ached</hi> with <lb/>
the woe of it every night in bed." She longed for "cats <lb/>
and home" with a longing that could not be satisfied. <lb/>
<pb n="70" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0241"/>
She even painted the word "Home" on a bit of card, <lb/>
and hung it round her neck by a ribbon under her <lb/>
clothes.</p>
<p>An older girl, having teased the child into revealing <lb/>
what charm or treasure was thus concealed, turned very <lb/>
red, called Sarah "a <hi rend="italic">good little thing</hi>," and walked <lb/>
rather shamefacedly away. The unusual epithet stuck <lb/>
fast in the little one's mind, and she pondered over it <lb/>
until she "almost wished it were true."</p>
<p>However, even school-life was, after this, not without <lb/>
its alleviations, for Sarah and her brother, who was also <lb/>
at school near that ladies' seminary at Brighton, were <lb/>
allowed to meet once a week, and spend a half-holiday <lb/>
together how and where they chose.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Sarah's health, never very robust, <lb/>
was decidedly growing worse. She had always felt <lb/>
wretchedly cold and depressed in winter, and suffered <lb/>
greatly from chilblains and earache, which all parental <lb/>
attempts to make her hardy by going out in bitter <lb/>
weather, washing in cold water, and sleeping in an <lb/>
unwarmed bedroom, had failed to cure. Now a feeling <lb/>
of incessant tiredness was added to her other ailments, <lb/>
and after a time release from the trying confinement <lb/>
and monotony of school-life and the still greater <lb/>
affliction of home-sickness, was brought about <reg orig="un-|expectedly">unexpectedly</reg> <lb/>
by the discovery that Sarah was developing <lb/>
a spinal complaint.</p>
<p>This disease she attributes to the hardships of <lb/>
scholastic discipline, one feature of which&mdash;prevalent, <lb/>
as many of us remember, until long after the date of <lb/>
Miss Robinson's education&mdash;was the sitting all day long <lb/>
on seats without backs.</p>
<p>In her case, unhappily, the resulting curvature of the <lb/>
spine had taken a sharp <hi rend="italic">inward</hi> turn, thus seriously <lb/>
<pb n="71" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0242"/>
affecting the internal organs and causing life-long <lb/>
suffering.</p>
<p>At first Sarah's delight at being at home and free <lb/>
once more was keen, but it soon became damped by <lb/>
the horrors of surgical treatment which she was forced <lb/>
to undergo. To surgeon after surgeon she was taken, <lb/>
and various kinds of treatment were tried, all more or <lb/>
less painful, but without any good result.</p>
<p>For fifteen months the poor girl lay stretched flat <lb/>
upon a hard couch; for another twelve months she <lb/>
"made a weekly pilgrimage to Brighton, in order to be <lb/>
pickled, pummelled, and plastered by a great quack"; <lb/>
for yet another dreary year later on she lodged alone in <lb/>
London for the purpose of being frequently examined <lb/>
by a specialist, who screwed her up more and more <lb/>
tightly in an instrument of torture called a "support." <lb/>
But all to no purpose. Her deformity steadily increased, <lb/>
and hope of alleviation was gradually abandoned.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Sarah Robinson had plenty of spirit, <lb/>
and those years at home after the abrupt termination <lb/>
of her unfinished education, when, except for surgical <lb/>
treatment, she was left to her own devices, seem on <lb/>
the whole to have been tolerably enjoyable. She <lb/>
cultivated her garden and made an arbour; she collected <lb/>
to herself a small library of second-hand poets, which <lb/>
she read assiduously, and arranged uniformly, bound <lb/>
by herself with green glazed cambric, in a book-case <lb/>
painted sky-blue.</p>
<p>In the holidays her two younger brothers were <lb/>
her companions as of yore, and the three revelled in <lb/>
pranks, many of which were played upon a <reg orig="much-|enduring">much-enduring</reg> <lb/>
relative, known as "Coz," who since some <lb/>
years before the death of Mrs. Robinson had assisted <lb/>
in the care of the children.</p>
<pb n="72" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0243"/>
<p>Owing probably to her military tastes, firearms and <lb/>
gunpowder at this time exercised a great fascination <lb/>
over Sarah as well as the boys. On one occasion her <lb/>
youngest brother had his hair and eyebrows blown off <lb/>
by the "firing of a train" laid along the nursery carpet; <lb/>
and on another the youngsters marvellously escaped <lb/>
being killed on the spot by the explosion of the <reg orig="coach-|man's">coachman's</reg> <lb/>
huge horse-pistol, with which they were about <lb/>
to experiment. Finally, Sarah bought herself a proper <lb/>
revolver, which she possessed and used for many years.</p>
<p>The attraction that peril of all kinds seemed to <lb/>
possess for the subject of our sketch seems oddly at <lb/>
variance with her constitutional timidity. But, as she <lb/>
says, she perceived within herself <hi rend="italic">two Sarahs</hi>, "and the <lb/>
one thought the other a fool." She therefore deliberately <lb/>
set herself to do everything of which she was afraid, and <lb/>
she records the belief that this habit of self-conquest <lb/>
was of the greatest possible service to her in after-life.</p>

<div2 type="chapter" n="II" id="d52">
<head><hi rend="bold">CHAPTER II. <lb/>
SUNSHINE ADDED TO DAYLIGHT.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Until</hi> Sarah Robinson was seventeen years of <lb/>
age she had no glimmering of a notion of the <lb/>
love of God.</p>
<p>She, with her sister and brothers, had been taken <lb/>
Sunday by Sunday in the family coach to Jireh Chapel, <lb/>
Lewes, an offshoot of one belonging to the Countess <lb/>
of Huntingdon's connection, where her parents <reg orig="wor-|shipped">worshipped</reg>, <lb/>
and this journey, with the "two hours of <lb/>
unintelligible service" at the end of it, was a weekly <lb/>
penance to her. She had been taught to say her <lb/>
<pb n="73" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0244"/>
prayers night and morning, and did it "as a kind of <lb/>
ceremony that it might be unlucky to omit."</p>
<p>From her father she had heard that "foolishness is <lb/>
bound up in the heart of a child," and that "childhood <lb/>
and youth are vanity"; while from a nurse she had <lb/>
learned that God "wouldn't love her" if she was <lb/>
naughty, to which latter information she had replied <lb/>
with characteristic independence, "Well, He needn't, <lb/>
then!" The doctrine of Predestination in its crudest <lb/>
form was believed in at Heasmonds, but such was <lb/>
Sarah's idea of an eternity in heaven with the God she <lb/>
imagined, that to be "saved" seemed as horrible as to <lb/>
be "lost," and she drove such subjects from her mind <lb/>
as long as she could.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the attendance of the young people at <lb/>
Jireh ceased after their mother's death, for Mr. Robinson <lb/>
had grown too deaf and nervous to enjoy the services. <lb/>
He built for himself a small chapel in the village, but <lb/>
on Sunday mornings the children were allowed to go <lb/>
where they pleased.</p>
<p>After trying all the places of worship within driving <lb/>
distance, they finally settled down at Chiddingly Church, <lb/>
attracted by the shortness of the sermons preached <lb/>
there. The Rev. James Vidal, a "gentle, humble, and <lb/>
Christlike" man, was the clergyman, and he in course <lb/>
of time became a valued friend of the family.</p>
<p>It was from the lips of this gentleman that, on one <lb/>
memorable August Sunday in 1851, Sarah Robinson <lb/>
heard the words which were destined to bring the glory <lb/>
of divine love into her hitherto sunless life.</p>
<p>The text of the sermon was "Abide in me," and from <lb/>
it the preacher showed "how that everything must <lb/>
begin with Christ, and how He undertook to complete <lb/>
and keep up the life He gave; how He would take <lb/>
<pb n="74" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0245"/>
us now, just as we were, if we desired it, and that <lb/>
the very desire was given by Him to draw us to <lb/>
Himself." He ended by saying twice over, "<hi rend="italic">Go to <lb/>
Christ to-day, and abide in Him ever after</hi>."</p>
<p>A feeling of hope and a desire for salvation thrilled <lb/>
through the heart of the young girl as she listened, <lb/>
and inwardly she said to the Lord Jesus that she did <lb/>
come to Him.</p>
<p>In the evening Sarah, as usual, attended her father's <lb/>
little chapel, there to hear doctrines which seemed <lb/>
to shatter her new-found faith, and for several weeks <lb/>
she thus listened to conflicting statements, until in <lb/>
desperation she resolved to read the Bible for herself, <lb/>
with prayer, and not be harassed by anyone's <reg orig="in-|terpretation">interpretation</reg> <lb/>
of it. At length, after months of patient <lb/>
searching, she gained the assurance of eternal life, <lb/>
which she was never afterwards allowed to doubt.</p>
<p>Strange to say, Mr. Robinson at first decidedly threw <lb/>
cold water upon his daughter's aspirations. She and <lb/>
her sister, whom she discovered had long been a <lb/>
Christian, became communicants at Mr. Vidal's church <lb/>
only with their father's reluctant consent, he warning <lb/>
them against the danger of "eating and drinking <lb/>
damnation" to themselves.</p>
<p>But in this trial Sarah's independence of spirit came <lb/>
to her aid. She refused to be discouraged, but went <lb/>
on in the way she felt to be right, constantly strengthened <lb/>
and guided by her now beloved Bible.</p>
<p>It is Miss Robinson's opinion that natures which <lb/>
are converted with difficulty possess one advantage <lb/>
over those who are naturally more devout&mdash;when they <lb/>
are converted they <hi rend="italic">know it</hi>.</p>
<p>And certainly the joy she herself experienced at this <lb/>
time was in strong contrast to the years of spiritual <lb/>
<pb n="75" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0246"/>
gloom which went before. She says, "I laughed and <lb/>
danced for lightheartedness. Is it I? Really myself? <lb/>
I thought, How wonderful to love the God I had hated, <lb/>
and to know that <hi rend="italic">He</hi> loves <hi rend="italic">me</hi>." No wonder her heart <lb/>
was glad.</p>
<p>It was very soon after Miss Robinson discovered for <lb/>
herself the marvellous truth which "adds sunshine <lb/>
to daylight, makes the sad happy, and the happy <lb/>
happier," that she eagerly sought to share her joy with <lb/>
others.</p>
<p>She spoke to her brothers, to various young people of <lb/>
her acquaintance, and to the servants; and a distinct <lb/>
blessing was upon her efforts. She also wrote letters <lb/>
to persons at a distance, and among these some of her <lb/>
former school-fellows, <hi rend="italic">five</hi> of whom she believes to have <lb/>
been truly converted to God by this means.</p>
<p>She would also visit and read the Bible to many of <lb/>
the cottagers who were unable to read for themselves, <lb/>
and she and her sister, at the urgent persuasion of the <lb/>
young French teacher before mentioned, who was still <lb/>
their correspondent and friend, started a Sunday-school <lb/>
in connection with their father's little chapel. Most of <lb/>
these ministrations seem to have been greatly <reg orig="appre-|ciated">appreciated</reg> <lb/>
and blessed.</p>
<p>When Miss Robinson was about twenty she was <lb/>
forced to give up all hope of ever being strong or well <lb/>
in this life. A surgeon told her plainly that it was only <lb/>
putting her to needless pain and expense to attempt <lb/>
a cure. He could only advise her to take care of her <lb/>
general health, and in particular <hi rend="italic">never to marry</hi>.</p>
<p>With the charming candour which everywhere <lb/>
characterises the autobiography from which this sketch <lb/>
is chiefly taken, the lady confesses that thereupon the <lb/>
idea of marriage appeared desirable as it never had <lb/>
<pb n="76" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0247"/>
done before, and for a few days she really fretted over <lb/>
her hard fate.</p>
<p>She was ashamed to take this trouble to anyone but <lb/>
God; as she beautifully and scripturally says, "He <lb/>
pities as a father, comforts as a mother, understands our <lb/>
thoughts afar off, knows our foolishness, and is touched <lb/>
with the feeling of our infirmities." So she told Him <lb/>
everything. And this message was sent into her mind, <lb/>
"<hi rend="italic">The unmarried woman careth for the things of the <lb/>
Lord</hi>."</p>
<p>Then, with tears of joy, she promised the Lord Jesus <lb/>
that if her life might be to care for the things of <lb/>
the Lord this should satisfy her. "<hi rend="italic">And</hi>," she adds, <lb/>
"<hi rend="italic">it has satisfied</hi>." Moreover, she besought that she <lb/>
might never have the least desire to marry. And this <lb/>
request also has been granted.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the verdict of the surgeon mentioned <lb/>
above, Mr. Robinson, two or three years later, persuaded <lb/>
his daughter to make one more effort after a cure, with <lb/>
the result that, as already recorded, she spent twelve <lb/>
months alone in London.</p>
<p>During this period Miss Robinson devoted much <lb/>
time to studying her Bible, and joined the Presbyterian <lb/>
Church in Regent Square, of which Dr. James Hamilton <lb/>
was pastor. She attempted to teach a Bible-class of <lb/>
elder girls, but this was a signal failure. The girls <lb/>
seemed to her "heartless, soulless, and brainless," and <lb/>
as vain, pert, and flippant as they well could be.</p>
<p>Amongst other things, Miss Robinson became while <lb/>
in London a helper at the Mission in Somers Town, <lb/>
which was supported by the members of Dr. Hamilton's <lb/>
church. Here she felt in her element, visiting, talking <lb/>
to, and doctoring the poor; though after a while she <lb/>
very unexpectedly found herself in sore disgrace with <lb/>
<pb n="77" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0248"/>
the powers ecclesiastical for having organised cottage <lb/>
meetings and <hi rend="italic">spoken at them!</hi></p>
<p>She was called to account at a "church meeting," <lb/>
and forbidden, because of her sex, to speak in public <lb/>
any more. Having pleaded in vain, she flatly refused <lb/>
to obey the deterrent injunction. Thereupon discipline <lb/>
was administered in the form of a prohibition from <lb/>
coming to the communion table, but this was calmly <lb/>
disregarded by the spirited rebel, and after a while was <lb/>
no longer enforced.</p>
<p>Returning home at the end of the stipulated time, <lb/>
physically none the better for all she had endured, but <lb/>
rather the worse, Miss Robinson made up her mind <lb/>
that, God helping her, she would never sink into the <lb/>
condition of helpless invalidism which some people <lb/>
seemed to think would be her unavoidable fate.</p>
<p>She made to her heavenly Father the definite request <lb/>
that her cross might never hinder work. She promised <lb/>
that by His grace she would not repine at pain and <lb/>
deformity if only she might <hi rend="italic">work</hi>. And she says, "All <lb/>
who know me will bear witness that this request has <lb/>
been fully granted."</p>
<p>Early in 1858 a trouble came upon the family at <lb/>
Heasmonds, which proved the first step in the direction <lb/>
of that great life-work which, all undreamed of by Miss <lb/>
Robinson, was awaiting her.</p>
<p>A great loss of property compelled Mr. Robinson <lb/>
to sell his country estate, give up his carriages and <lb/>
horses, and remove elsewhere.</p>
<p>This was a terrible grief to all concerned, and to <lb/>
Sarah, the home-lover, in particular. Her work among <lb/>
the village people must be ended, her cottager friends <lb/>
bidden farewell to, her animal pets given away. On <lb/>
the last day she went to all her favourite haunts, <lb/>
<pb n="78" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0249"/>
gathering a few flowers as mementoes from each, and <lb/>
nailing them down in a little <hi rend="italic">coffin</hi>, which she cherished <lb/>
in secret for <hi rend="italic">thirty years</hi>.</p>
<p>The family removed at first to Brighton, and although <lb/>
Sarah "detested" the place and they only stayed there <lb/>
a few months, she contrived to do some good work, <lb/>
teaching a class of boys in the Presbyterian <reg orig="Sunday-|school">Sunday-school</reg> <lb/>
with as much success and pleasure as her former <lb/>
attempt with the girls had been marked by the reverse, <lb/>
and visiting, as she ever loved to do, among the sick <lb/>
and poor.</p>
<p>While at Brighton, Sarah enjoyed some <reg orig="companion-|ship">companionship</reg> <lb/>
with her youngest brother, who was articled to a <lb/>
solicitor in that town. He had a boat of his own, and <lb/>
the irrepressible invalid was wont to rise at two, three, <lb/>
or four of a summer morning and row out with him <lb/>
on a fishing expedition. Being naturally afraid of the <lb/>
sea, as she remarks, made her all the more eager to go. <lb/>
They also had excursions and Bible-readings together, <lb/>
and practised shooting with their pistols.</p>
<p>In the autumn of that same year came the <hi rend="italic">second</hi> <lb/>
step towards our heroine's destiny. This was the <lb/>
removal of the family and all their belongings to <reg orig="Box-|grove">Boxgrove</reg>, <lb/>
near Guildford, in Surrey, on the high road to <lb/>
London, and within ten miles of <hi rend="italic">Aldershot</hi>.</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="III" id="d53">
<head><hi rend="bold">CHAPTER III. <lb/>
IN BARRACKS AND CAMP.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Miss Robinson</hi>, in her vivacious way, gives <lb/>
us some amusing pictures of life in the quaint <lb/>
old town of Guildford fifty years ago. But these, as <lb/>
well as those of many phases of work unconsciously <lb/>
preparatory for her great mission, we must reluctantly <lb/>
<pb n="79" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0250"/>
pass over, and hasten forward to her first acquaintance <lb/>
with the hero Thomas Atkins, who was fated to be the <lb/>
love of her life.</p>
<p>Miss Robinson's interest in soldiers, first aroused in <lb/>
her early childhood, was reawakened in the month of <lb/>
April, 1860, when, in company with a small party of <lb/>
Scottish friends, she paid a three days' visit to <reg orig="Alder-|shot">Aldershot</reg> <lb/>
Camp. This was her first sight of soldiers and <lb/>
camp life; and it stirred her heart to hear the Scottish <lb/>
Psalms sung by two regiments of Highlanders.</p>
<p>The Crimean War and the Indian Mutiny were at <lb/>
that time fresh in everyone's mind. Miss Robinson <lb/>
had been specially interested in the work of Florence <lb/>
Nightingale, and in the testimony of the latter to the <lb/>
marvellous patience, heroism, and self-sacrifice of our <lb/>
men on service. Therefore it was quite a shock to her <lb/>
to find on coming to Guildford that soldiers were <reg orig="ex-|cessively">excessively</reg> <lb/>
unpopular among the civilian population. <lb/>
This was partly owing to the evil influences connected <lb/>
with Aldershot, and partly to the fact that the men <lb/>
knew themselves to be disliked, and acted up to the <lb/>
bad character gratuitously bestowed upon them.</p>
<p>It was in that same year, 1860, that a working-man <lb/>
friend of Miss Robinson's begged her to pray for the <lb/>
69th Regiment at Burmah, as three of his wife's brothers <lb/>
belonged to it, and said in their letters that many of <lb/>
the men were teetotalers and Christians. This led to <lb/>
a correspondence being established between the lady <lb/>
and that regiment, which was kept up until its return <lb/>
to England.</p>
<p>In 1862 Miss Robinson attended the Conference at <lb/>
Barnet, where she became acquainted with a Mrs. <lb/>
Daniell, an officer's widow, who, having inaugurated <lb/>
some Village Missions, had been urged to extend her <lb/>
<pb n="80" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0251"/>
labours to Aldershot. Delighted at this prospect, Miss <lb/>
Robinson added her persuasions to those of others, with <lb/>
the result that Mrs. Daniell decided to take up her <lb/>
residence for a time at the camp.</p>
<p>A house was rented at Aldershot to serve as a <lb/>
temporary Soldiers' Home until the new Institute and <lb/>
Mission Hall, for which a valuable site and &pound;1,000 <lb/>
in money had already been given, could be erected. <lb/>
Here meetings were held, with the help of both officers <lb/>
and privates, and Mrs. Daniell's missionary, and much <lb/>
good was done.</p>
<p>Miss Robinson threw herself heart and soul into this <lb/>
congenial work, and saw Mrs. Daniell frequently. She <lb/>
also organised meetings at Guildford for the latter to <lb/>
give addresses and arouse sympathy.</p>
<p>Another way in which Miss Robinson proved of <lb/>
great assistance to the older lady and at the same <lb/>
time gained training and experience for herself, was <lb/>
by acting at the Home as a sort of go-between for the <lb/>
soldiers downstairs and Mrs. Daniell upstairs, the latter <lb/>
being so deaf as to be compelled to use an ear-trumpet, <lb/>
which was a great hindrance to her in gaining the <lb/>
men's confidence.</p>
<p>The new Institute was opened in October, 1863. <lb/>
The saintly Mr. Pennefather gave the first address, <lb/>
and several conversions occurred during the first week. <lb/>
Among well-known Christian workers who helped at <lb/>
that interesting time may be mentioned Mr. Denham <lb/>
Smith, Dr. Elwin, Captain Fishbourne, <hi rend="small-caps">R.N</hi>., Lord <lb/>
Radstock, Hon. Captain Hobart, Captain Hawes, Mr. <lb/>
Stevenson Blackwood, Mr. Haslam, Mr. Richard Weaver, <lb/>
Hon. Arthur Kinnaird, Mr. Henry Varley, and others.</p>
<p>During that opening week Miss Robinson sold nearly <lb/>
600 hymn-books used in the meetings, and received <lb/>
<pb n="81" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0252"/>
more than &pound;200 in donations to the Institute from <lb/>
visitors. As a wind-up she got up a public tea, when <lb/>
350 people were entertained and a Gospel meeting held.</p>
<p>Throughout the first year of the Institute's existence <lb/>
Miss Robinson was a great deal there, living in the <lb/>
building, with only occasional visits home. She acted <lb/>
as Mrs. Daniell's deputy when that lady was absent, <lb/>
and became more and more attached to the men and <lb/>
the work.</p>
<p>"At that time," she writes, "there were many old <lb/>
soldiers unable to read. When such became converted <lb/>
they were, of course, anxious to learn. Manfully <lb/>
teachers and scholars would toil on in all sorts of <lb/>
places&mdash;guard-room, stables, hospital, and barracks, <reg orig="be-|sides">besides</reg> <lb/>
the Institute, the lesson-book being always the <lb/>
New Testament. Passages of Scripture and hymns <lb/>
would also be taught and learned by heart."</p>
<p>Various evangelists would come and take the large <lb/>
Sunday meetings, and sometimes for a few consecutive <lb/>
days' preaching, but the other helpers often had to <lb/>
manage this work between them.</p>
<p>Miss Robinson was selected to address a weekly <lb/>
mothers' meeting of 150 or 200 women, but she does <lb/>
not appear to have been so well adapted for that kind <lb/>
of thing as for dealing with lads or men, and the <hi rend="italic">babies</hi>, <lb/>
inevitably present, disturbed her dreadfully. She <reg orig="de-|clared">declared</reg> <lb/>
once that she believed the mothers must be <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">pinching</hi> them to make them squall so! "It was like <lb/>
a poultry show, with a large contingent of Cochin-China <lb/>
fowls and little pigs."</p>
<p>At first, strange as it may seem nowadays, there was <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">no temperance work</hi> in connection with the Institute, <lb/>
though drink then, as ever, was acknowledged to be the <lb/>
soldier's chief curse. Miss Robinson, however, had now <lb/>
<pb n="82" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0253"/>
for several years been a total abstainer, having given up <lb/>
the wine, so long considered essential to her delicate <lb/>
health, from conscientious convictions, and after much <lb/>
suffering and patient perseverance, found herself at <lb/>
length able to do quite as well, or better, without it. <lb/>
Notwithstanding some opposition from Mrs. Daniell, <lb/>
who was not a teetotaler, and at one time declared <lb/>
she "would not have anything" at the Institute "but <lb/>
the Gospel," a Total Abstinence Society was formed, <lb/>
with Christian officers to take the lead.</p>
<p>A great part of Miss Robinson's work at this period <lb/>
consisted in correspondence. In 1864 she wrote 630 <lb/>
letters to Christian soldiers who had been removed to <lb/>
other stations, and&mdash;like Miss Weston among the sailors <lb/>
&mdash;she found this kind of help so much appreciated that <lb/>
by 1872 the number had increased to 2,200, in addition <lb/>
to 685 parcels sent abroad.</p>
<p>Wherever these converted soldiers went they planted <lb/>
what they called a <hi rend="italic">twig</hi> of the Aldershot Mission, and <lb/>
branches were thus established in many towns of England <lb/>
and at foreign stations in various parts of the world.</p>
<p>An officer once said, "When anything queer is going <lb/>
on you'll find Miss Robinson in the thick of it." "Not <lb/>
a very desirable character," she comments, but owing to <lb/>
"a lack of caution, plunging into things without thought <lb/>
of results." Indeed, no locality was too vile or too <lb/>
dangerous for her to invade if there were the slightest <lb/>
chance of bringing a light into its darkness; no man or <lb/>
woman was too wicked or too desperate for her to talk <lb/>
to, visit, and befriend.</p>
<p>On one occasion Miss Robinson, in searching for a <lb/>
sick woman in a low lodging-house, wandered <reg orig="accident-|ally">accidentally</reg> <lb/>
into a thieves' kitchen. One of the desperadoes <lb/>
inside at once shut the door and <hi rend="italic">stood against it</hi>.</p>
<pb n="83" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0254"/>
<p>But our heroine's presence of mind and readiness of <lb/>
resource never forsook her. She at once apologised for <lb/>
intruding, and offered to sing them a song they had <lb/>
never heard before. Without waiting for permission <lb/>
she struck up with one of Richard Weaver's hymns&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"We're bound for the land of the pure and the holy,</l>
<l>The home of the happy, the kingdom of love."</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>The people listened quietly, both to the hymn and to <lb/>
a few simple, kindly words which followed it, and gave <lb/>
their uninvited visitor permission to go and see them <lb/>
again. Of this Miss Robinson joyfully availed herself. <lb/>
Many visits followed, at which Bible stories were told <lb/>
and hymns sung, always including, by special request, <lb/>
the one they had first heard; and four definite <reg orig="con-|versions">conversions</reg> <lb/>
were the result.</p>
<p>Before leaving Aldershot Miss Robinson held a <reg orig="tea-|party">tea-party</reg> <lb/>
in that same kitchen. She took the provisions, <lb/>
but the inmates supplied the tea-service, "consisting <lb/>
chiefly of old jam-pots, clothes-pegs to stir with, <reg orig="pub-|licans">publicans</reg>' <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">borrowed</hi> beer cans to 'mash' the tea in, and <lb/>
pieces of newspaper for plates." At parting they paid <lb/>
the lady the compliment of saying they reckoned her <lb/>
quite <hi rend="italic">one of themselves!</hi></p>
<p>It was a great grief to Miss Robinson when Mrs. <lb/>
Daniell decided to put the Mission Hall under the <lb/>
charge of a gentleman. She appears to have been not <lb/>
quite satisfied with her enthusiastic helper, <reg orig="notwith-|standing">notwithstanding</reg> <lb/>
the signal blessing with which the labours of <lb/>
the latter had been crowned. She was a timid woman, <lb/>
extremely sensitive to public opinion, and seemed <lb/>
terribly afraid lest the daring enterprise and <reg orig="deep-|diving">deep-diving</reg> <lb/>
of Miss Robinson might bring <hi rend="italic">her</hi> work into <lb/>
disrepute. But she afterwards confessed that she wished <lb/>
that their union had continued.</p>
<pb n="84" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0255"/>
<p>On returning to her home at Guildford Miss Robinson <lb/>
was not long ere she found fresh work to do, this time <lb/>
in connection with a night school for big boys. Their <lb/>
conduct was most unruly, and more than once, in her <lb/>
capacity of superintendent, she sent for a policeman <lb/>
or closed the school.</p>
<p>At last the happy inspiration to <hi rend="italic">drill</hi> them seized her, <lb/>
and she found, as Professor Henry Drummond and the <lb/>
leaders of the Boys' Brigade afterwards did, that <hi rend="italic">military</hi> <lb/>
discipline acted like a charm when all ordinary authority <lb/>
was powerless. She learned and taught the various <lb/>
exercises so correctly that some of the lads who <reg orig="after-|wards">afterwards</reg> <lb/>
joined the militia and volunteers passed through <lb/>
their preliminary drill at once as competent.</p>
<p>A Band of Hope and a drum and fife band were also <lb/>
organised in connection with this school.</p>
<p>When the 69th Regiment, with which Miss Robinson <lb/>
and her Guildford men had all this time been <reg orig="corre-|sponding">corresponding</reg>, <lb/>
returned to England, they were quartered at <lb/>
Gosport, and soon invited their friend over to a big <reg orig="tea-|meeting">tea-meeting</reg>, <lb/>
which was to be held in rooms that their <lb/>
colonel allowed them to use for religious and <reg orig="temper-|ance">temperance</reg> <lb/>
purposes. This was her first visit to the Portsmouth <lb/>
garrison. During the meeting after the tea she spoke a <lb/>
few words to the men, which delighted them so much <lb/>
that they at once planned another tea, at which she was <lb/>
to address a larger audience.</p>
<p>This was a great success, hardened men weeping <lb/>
outright at what they heard from Miss Robinson of the <lb/>
love of God and the claims of Christ, and souls, it is <lb/>
believed, were saved. Further meetings were resolved <lb/>
upon, but, incredible as it may seem, the matter was <lb/>
officially inquired into, and such arrangements forbidden, <lb/>
as being "subversive of military discipline"! Not even <lb/>
<pb n="85" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0256"/>
the Regimental Temperance Society was allowed, <lb/>
though before the 69th left Portsmouth &pound;6,000 of their <lb/>
Indian savings and 500 stripes and good - conduct <lb/>
badges were lost through drink and dissipation.</p>
<p>At home once more, Miss Robinson continued to <lb/>
see all she could of the soldiers and speak to them <lb/>
whenever possible. Small parties from the Camp <reg orig="con-|tinually">continually</reg> <lb/>
shared her hospitality at Guildford, and she <lb/>
would go over to Aldershot Mission Hall for any special <lb/>
meetings there.</p>
<p>In 1865 she paid a visit to Brighton, and curiously <lb/>
enough was asked to give a lecture at the same Young <lb/>
Ladies' Academy where she had so unmeritoriously <lb/>
distinguished herself some twenty years before, but only <lb/>
one teacher was left who remembered her. A bit of <lb/>
the old mischievous Sarah peeped out as she suggested <lb/>
to the Principal that she must have been invited for the <lb/>
same reason the people got "Converted Prize-fighters" <lb/>
and "Hallelujah Pickpockets" to address their meetings! <lb/>
At this the poor lady was so shocked that Miss Robinson <lb/>
hastened to assure her that she would be <hi rend="italic">quite proper</hi> <lb/>
during the lecture, which subsequently went off with <lb/>
success.</p>
<p>It was during this sojourn at Brighton that Miss <lb/>
Robinson began visiting the soldiers in barracks, and <lb/>
distributing copies of the Bible, <hi rend="italic">Pilgrim's Progress, <lb/>
British Workman</hi>, and other suitable literature. She <lb/>
also lectured in a small chapel lent her for the purpose. <lb/>
She got to know the men's wives and little ones, and as <lb/>
she carried illuminated text-cards and packets of sweets <lb/>
in her bag she was welcomed wherever she went.</p>
<p>By-and-by the regiment in which Miss Robinson <lb/>
had become interested at Brighton was removed to <lb/>
Hounslow, and there, on three several occasions, she <lb/>
<pb n="86" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0257"/>
spent a fortnight with them by special invitation, and <lb/>
occupied a spare hospital ward. These were grand <lb/>
times for work. In the mornings she talked with the <lb/>
men who happened to be about, in the afternoons she <lb/>
visited the troop-rooms and married quarters, and in <lb/>
the evenings she held meetings in the largest hospital <lb/>
ward.</p>
<p>Other garrisons and camps were subsequently visited <lb/>
in the same way, and when at length Miss Robinson, <lb/>
through the reports of army schoolmasters, succeeded <lb/>
in getting her name into the Parliamentary Blue Book <lb/>
as <hi rend="italic">Lecturer</hi>, under the head of "Military Education," <lb/>
she felt that her position was secure.</p>
<p>Everywhere her work was attended with marked <lb/>
success. She says she grew to quite "<hi rend="italic">love</hi> the men, <lb/>
such big, simple, affectionate, grateful fellows, and so <lb/>
easily interested in what one told them," while her <lb/>
power over them, and their willingness to listen to her <lb/>
addresses, filled the officers with amazement. One man <lb/>
remarked, and it was evidently intended as the highest <lb/>
compliment, "You can't gammon Miss Robinson; she <lb/>
might have been a soldier herself."</p>
<p>For eight years, from 1865, the "Soldier's Friend," <lb/>
as she now came to be called, spent her time in <lb/>
itinerating. She visited Aldershot, Brighton, Bristol, <lb/>
Colchester, Chatham, Canterbury, Dover, Deal, <reg orig="Dor-|chester">Dorchester</reg>, <lb/>
Exeter, Hythe, Hounslow, Leeds, London, <lb/>
Maidstone, Plymouth, Portsmouth, Parkhurst, Sheerness, <lb/>
Shorncliffe, Trowbridge, Weymouth, Winchester, <reg orig="Wool-|wich">Woolwich</reg>, <lb/>
Warley, Windsor, and York; and most of these <lb/>
places not once only, but several times. During those <lb/>
eight years Miss Robinson paid 190 visits to different <lb/>
military stations, and spent a total of 1130 days at <lb/>
them, besides her visits and lectures for civilians. To <lb/>
<pb n="87" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0258"/>
provide the necessary funds for this work she spent <lb/>
most of the dress allowance she received with her sister <lb/>
from their mother's property, and also disposed of all <lb/>
her own share of Mrs. Robinson's valuable jewels&mdash;all, <lb/>
at least, except one emerald and diamond ring, from <lb/>
which she could not make up her mind to part. Strange <lb/>
to say, she soon after had the misfortune to lose this <lb/>
ring when far from home, so, as she says, she "might <lb/>
just as well have given it to the Lord with the rest."</p>
<p>All this time the undaunted woman was suffering <lb/>
more or less acutely from the spinal complaint which <lb/>
was her lifelong cross. The pain was sometimes <lb/>
almost agonising, but she dared not say anything about <lb/>
it lest her father should absolutely forbid those <reg orig="expedi-|tions">expeditions</reg>, <lb/>
of which already he tacitly disapproved, and from <lb/>
which she generally returned home worn out and ill, <lb/>
only to somewhat recuperate and start afresh.</p>
<p>It was not only among the regular troops that Miss <lb/>
Robinson carried on her work; the generally despised <lb/>
"militiamen" also appealed to her sympathies, and <lb/>
had reason to bless her for her ever-ready friendship <lb/>
and aid.</p>
<p>Her first acquaintance with this class was when she <lb/>
undertook three weeks' work among the 700 men of the <lb/>
Wilts Militia, who were billeted in the twenty-eight <lb/>
public-houses of the town of Devizes. This was at the <lb/>
solicitation of an Independent minister, who was much <lb/>
grieved at their neglected condition. With the <reg orig="co-|operation">cooperation</reg> <lb/>
of this gentleman's sisters, a temporary <lb/>
reading-room was opened and supplied with books, <lb/>
papers, pictures, and games. Here, of an evening, the <lb/>
ladies would be ready to receive any who might come&mdash; <lb/>
to read, sing, or talk to them, or to help them write <lb/>
letters to their friends. Coffee and cake could be <lb/>
<pb n="88" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0259"/>
bought cheaply, and each evening closed with family <lb/>
prayers.</p>
<p>In order to reach the men, however, Miss Robinson <lb/>
had to go to them with her invitation. This meant <lb/>
penetrating to the coach-houses, stables, and even <reg orig="cow-|sheds">cowsheds</reg> <lb/>
of the public-houses where they were lodged. <lb/>
These places were often dirty and wretched to a degree, <lb/>
sometimes without window or fireplace, and with only a <lb/>
damp earthen floor. Sometimes the "room" was reached <lb/>
only by a step-ladder, and was boarded with planks so <lb/>
perilously thin that they threatened to give way as <lb/>
people moved about upon them. Often she would have <lb/>
readings in a tap-room. But wherever she went, so <lb/>
great was her tact, so perfect her <hi rend="italic">adaptedness</hi> for the <lb/>
peculiar mission she had chosen, that her Bible <reg orig="story-|telling">storytelling</reg> <lb/>
and hymn-singing were almost invariably listened <lb/>
to with respectful attention, and she was generally asked <lb/>
to go again.</p>
<p>Also, the chief aim of Miss Robinson and her helpers <lb/>
was frequently attained, and many of the men were <lb/>
induced to attend both prayer-meetings and <reg orig="Sunday-|evening">Sunday-evening</reg> <lb/>
services. Some came for private interviews <lb/>
and counsel. Twenty-seven conversions were believed <lb/>
to have taken place during those three weeks, and there <lb/>
were numbers still seeking the light when the time came <lb/>
for them to leave. In addition, more than a hundred <lb/>
men had signed the temperance pledge, and 600 letters <lb/>
had been written, with more or less assistance, in the <lb/>
reading-rooms. &lpar;Miss Robinson was "great at <hi rend="italic">love <lb/>
letters</hi>," she says.&rpar;</p>
<p>The following year the "Soldier's Friend" was invited <lb/>
to the same town again, but owing, as she believed, to <lb/>
the intentional opposition of the publicans, she had <lb/>
much more difficulty in getting a hearing. However, <lb/>
<pb n="89" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0260"/>
better arrangements were eventually made for the <lb/>
accommodation of the militia, and they were no longer <lb/>
billeted in public-houses.</p>
<p>The teaching of total abstinence has been a prominent <lb/>
feature of Miss Robinson's work. She considers it a <lb/>
"physical remedy for a physical evil," but her ultimate <lb/>
object is always nothing less than to "bring men into <lb/>
touch with the Lord Jesus Christ. All kindness shown, <lb/>
all pleasant things provided, are simply as adjuncts to <lb/>
that. 'Whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the <lb/>
name of the Lord Jesus.'" It disgusted her to see <lb/>
people who had been getting up total abstinence <lb/>
meetings sit down afterwards to a supper with wine <lb/>
and beer; she considered it "a mean, sneaking thing <lb/>
to ask others to abstain without doing it oneself."</p>
<p>When fashionable folks condescended to patronise the <lb/>
soldiers and their friend, and invited Miss Robinson to <lb/>
their houses, she felt far less comfortable than among <lb/>
her men in a troop-room. Indeed, she owns that even <lb/>
among quite nice people she was not happy, on account <lb/>
of her "wretched shyness." Yet she does not seem to <lb/>
have ever felt shy with the men themselves. Wherever <lb/>
she saw a soldier, sober or drunk, she was able to go up <lb/>
to him and say the right word, and send him on his <lb/>
way the better for having met her. Her name soon <lb/>
became known, not only all over England, but in India <lb/>
also, and it was synonymous everywhere with a cheery <lb/>
friendliness to which poor Tommy Atkins had <reg orig="hereto-|fore">heretofore</reg> <lb/>
been a stranger.</p>
<p>In those early days the cognomen of "Miss Robinson" <lb/>
stood, she tells us, rather for a species than an individual, <lb/>
and among those who had never seen her face any <reg orig="kind-|mannered">kind-mannered</reg> <lb/>
lady who was not above speaking to a soldier <lb/>
was likely to get called by that name.</p>
<pb n="90" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0261"/>
<p>The contempt and dislike in which the defenders of <lb/>
our country were at that time popularly held was always <lb/>
a source of amazement to their friend, especially as it <lb/>
was coupled with a good deal of empty sentiment about <lb/>
them in paintings or poetry. On one occasion she had <lb/>
ordered dinner for herself and three sergeants who were <lb/>
to travel with her, in the second-class refreshment-room <lb/>
of one of our great railway stations. But after they had <lb/>
sat down, a waitress came and told them she was very <lb/>
sorry, but people did not like soldiers in the room. So <lb/>
they had to go, leaving their dinner uneaten and unpaid <lb/>
for. Another time, when piloting a newly married <lb/>
sergeant and his bride around the sights of London, <lb/>
the former was rudely refused admittance to what was <lb/>
known as "The London Crystal Palace," in Oxford <lb/>
Street, simply because he was wearing Her Majesty's <lb/>
uniform! The difficulty Miss Robinson always <reg orig="ex-|perienced">experienced</reg> <lb/>
in finding lodgings for the men whom she <lb/>
brought to London to speak at temperance meetings, <lb/>
or for herself, when itinerating, to secure rooms which <lb/>
might be used as a little temporary soldiers' home, <lb/>
was immense, and thoroughly roused her indignation. <lb/>
"Really one would think that soldiers were lepers to <lb/>
see the way they are treated!" she angrily comments <lb/>
in her diary. This, by the way, was in 1869.</p>
<p>It was, indeed, this fact as much as anything which <lb/>
attracted Miss Robinson towards poor Tommy, for she <lb/>
was the same Sarah Robinson who years before <reg orig="cham-|pioned">championed</reg> <lb/>
the ill-used teacher, and made a friend of the most <lb/>
neglected girl in the school. She says, "The isolation, <lb/>
the contempt, the unkindness, the cruel temptations of <lb/>
his lot&hellip; drew out all the <hi rend="italic">motherliness</hi> of my heart.&hellip; <lb/>
It is a small thing to say I could have died for them. I <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">lived</hi> for them; to seek their welfare became my very life.</p>
<pb n="91" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0262"/>
<p>She, however, thinks that soldiers of the present day <lb/>
are somewhat spoiled. "They take all their advantages, <lb/>
and friends in every garrison, as a matter of course, and <lb/>
can form no idea of the insult and neglect their <reg orig="pre-|decessors">predecessors</reg> <lb/>
too often had to bear."</p>

A TOWN TRANSFORMED.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Space</hi> would fail us to tell a tenth part of Miss <lb/>
Robinson's work among the soldiers in town and <lb/>
country, in troop-rooms, in hospitals, in camp. To any <lb/>
who are interested in this brief sketch of her busy life <lb/>
we would warmly recommend the perusal of her <reg orig="auto-|biography">autobiography</reg>, <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">A Life Record</hi>, from the bright, graphic <lb/>
pages of which the facts narrated here are chiefly taken.</p>
<p>Passing over, therefore, much that we would gladly <lb/>
relate of the joys and sorrows of our heroine's <reg orig="self-|chosen">self-chosen</reg> <lb/>
mission, of her encounters with the officers, some <lb/>
of whom were courteous and helpful, others strangely <lb/>
opposed to her work, of her almost invariable success <lb/>
in winning the friendship and confidence of the men <lb/>
in every regiment with which she came in contact, of <lb/>
her happiness in often seeing the fruits of her labours <lb/>
in genuinely reformed lives, of her sadness over those <lb/>
who relapsed&mdash;generally through drink&mdash;and the <reg orig="en-|couragement">encouragement</reg> <lb/>
afforded by the hundreds of simple, <lb/>
touching letters, full of love and gratitude, which <lb/>
reached her from her men in various parts of the <lb/>
world, we must hasten on to speak of the founding <lb/>
of her famous Soldiers' Institute at Portsmouth.</p>
<p>Thirty years ago Portsmouth was, to use Miss <lb/>
Robinson's own words, "Satan's very seat," as regards <lb/>
<pb n="92" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0263"/>
the soldiers and sailors who were constantly being <lb/>
landed there. Regiments generally arrived with a good <lb/>
character and left with a bad one. They would return <lb/>
from years of service abroad, with all their savings and <lb/>
prize-money in their pockets, often amounting to &pound;5,000 <lb/>
or &pound;6,000, and sometimes more, to find over a thousand <lb/>
public-houses and gin-shops, dancing saloons, <reg orig="music-|halls">music-halls</reg>, <lb/>
and still viler temptations awaiting them; and <lb/>
there they would "have their fling and spend their <lb/>
money, and lose health and character and their very <lb/>
souls."</p>
<p>Miss Robinson's description of the streets, when on <lb/>
one occasion she went seeking several men whose <lb/>
relatives had begged her to see them, is as vivid as it <lb/>
is shocking. "Soldiers were drinking spirits out of <lb/>
pewter-pots, and almost forcing passers-by to partake; <lb/>
cabs were driving from one public-house to another <lb/>
loaded inside and out with drunken, shouting men and <lb/>
women; girls caught hold of me and waltzed me round <lb/>
to the strains of a fiddle, and when I had found any <lb/>
man I was seeking I had to take him by the arm, to <lb/>
coax and plead, and almost drag him away."</p>
<p>The first means of bringing the "Soldier's Friend" <reg orig="with-|in">within</reg> <lb/>
touch of this sink of iniquity was a little Temperance <lb/>
Coffee and Reading-room for Royal Marines, Soldiers, <lb/>
and Sailors, opened at Gosport by some Christian <lb/>
teetotalers belonging to the Royal Marines of the <lb/>
Gosport Division, in consequence of meetings in <lb/>
barracks having been forbidden. Gosport, as most of <lb/>
my readers know, lies opposite to Portsmouth on the <lb/>
other side of the harbour.</p>
<p>From here, somewhere about the year 1866, Miss <lb/>
Robinson made occasional excursions to the <reg orig="Ports-|mouth">Portsmouth</reg> <lb/>
side to address meetings of other regiments <lb/>
<pb n="93" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0264"/>
and to promote the cause of temperance. It was in <lb/>
connection with one of these visits that she had an <lb/>
unpleasant adventure, for though morally and spiritually <lb/>
her experiences were generally bright, the physical <reg orig="dis-|comforts">discomforts</reg> <lb/>
she often had to undergo were sufficient to <lb/>
have completely daunted most women, not to speak of <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">invalids</hi>.</p>
<p>The weather had turned out too rough for <reg orig="floating-|bridge">floating-bridge</reg> <lb/>
or boats to cross between the two towns, and <lb/>
Miss Robinson found herself stranded <hi rend="italic">alone in <reg orig="Ports-|mouth">Portsmouth</reg></hi>, <lb/>
near ten o'clock, on a wet, windy night, very <lb/>
tired, and with only sixpence in her pocket.</p>
<p>Strange to say, it never occurred to her to apply <lb/>
to any of the officers resident in the place, nor to any <lb/>
Christian minister, who doubtless would have been <lb/>
delighted to help her, nor even to the police. But <lb/>
she wandered from one public-house &lpar;!&rpar; to another <lb/>
seeking a night's lodging, until she at length found <lb/>
a place where they would give her a little room to <lb/>
herself for her solitary sixpence. Here, supperless, she <lb/>
obtained at least a shelter, but, the lock on the door <lb/>
proving insecure, she lay on the floor against it all <lb/>
night, and in the early morning, aching and starved, <lb/>
she made her way to the floating-bridge, and <hi rend="italic">begged</hi> <lb/>
a penny for her fare to cross by it and get home.</p>
<p>Repeated disappointments in her work at Portsmouth <lb/>
forced the belief upon Miss Robinson's mind that no <lb/>
lasting good would ever be done until a Soldiers' Home <lb/>
with earnest Christian workers could be established <lb/>
there. But still, for a while, she did not quite see her <lb/>
way to attempting it.</p>
<p>In 1872 about 10,000 men were ordered out to <lb/>
the wilds of Dorsetshire for Autumn Man&oelig;uvres. <lb/>
Nothing whatever was done on this occasion for their <lb/>

comfort, or to keep them sober. There were no means <lb/>
of writing to their friends, or of sending money to <lb/>
mothers or wives; there was no recreation; often there <lb/>
was nothing to drink but beer, in which most of the <lb/>
men's pay was spent; over 1,000 pledges were broken, <lb/>
and the staunch abstainers suffered greatly for want <lb/>
of water.</p>
<p>On hearing of all this, Miss Robinson for the time <lb/>
abandoned her schemes with regard to Portsmouth, <lb/>
and turned her energies towards alleviating this still <lb/>
more pressing need.</p>
<p>She accordingly, in view of the next year's man&oelig;uvres, <lb/>
which were to take place on Dartmoor, secured permission <lb/>
from the Horse Guards and co-operation from the <lb/>
National Temperance League. The latter society was <lb/>
willing to find all necessary funds if Miss Robinson <lb/>
would undertake to personally carry the work through. <lb/>
This she promised, and having got two strong horses <lb/>
and a waggoner, two large marquees and some smaller <lb/>
tents, an old gipsy-van, cleaned and done up, for her <lb/>
own private accommodation, and ten men to help her, <lb/>
she started on her new campaign.</p>
<p>For the next <hi rend="italic">nine weeks</hi> this truly heroic woman lived <lb/>
in the midst of the soldiers in open camp, her only <lb/>
lodging the gipsy-van, her bed a short bunk, in which <lb/>
she could only lie with knees drawn up, her food chiefly <lb/>
biscuits and tea, having no time to prepare anything <lb/>
else, and the rain falling in torrents a great part of the <lb/>
time.</p>
<p>All day long the men kept them going. One day's <lb/>
sale of refreshments on an average would be 150 gallons <lb/>
of coffee, 6 gallons of tea, 20 gallons of lemonade, <lb/>
80 loaves, 500 buns, 20 lbs. of ham and German sausage, <lb/>
50 lbs. of cake and biscuits, and <hi rend="italic">all in pennyworths!</hi> <lb/>
<pb n="95" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0266"/>
The men on the one side could come to the big <lb/>
marquee to be served, but the waggon had to traverse <lb/>
the moors to supply the needs of the "enemy."</p>
<p>When the sham fight at Dartmoor was over other <lb/>
regiments had their turn at Cannock Chase; hither Miss <lb/>
Robinson's caravan and tents followed, and similar <lb/>
experiences to those already recorded were passed <lb/>
through. The arrangements made for the transaction <lb/>
of postal business were greatly appreciated. Over <lb/>
7,000 penny stamps were sold to the men during the <lb/>
campaign, and more than &pound;1,100, in 342 separate sums <lb/>
of money, were transmitted to relatives at home. The <lb/>
gratitude of the whole army, officers and men alike, was <lb/>
quite overwhelming; twenty-three written testimonials <lb/>
were forwarded to the National Temperance League, <lb/>
and appreciative notices of the work appeared in all the <lb/>
leading newspapers.</p>
<p>It is sad to relate that Miss Robinson's health was <lb/>
entirely ruined by the hardships she at that time went <lb/>
through, and she never regained her power of walking. <lb/>
Nevertheless, she rejoiced in the good accomplished <lb/>
and the evil prevented, and also felt that, though the <lb/>
founding of a Soldiers' Institute had been somewhat <lb/>
delayed by this other work, the ultimate result was <lb/>
really assisted by the confidence and popularity she <lb/>
had thus gained.</p>
<p>On her return from the Autumn Man&oelig;uvres, Miss <lb/>
Robinson proceeded vigorously with her former project, <lb/>
and the first thing to be done was to find a house <lb/>
suitable for transformation into an Institute.</p>
<p>This proved a difficult task, and incredible as it may <lb/>
seem, there was much opposition in Portsmouth to Miss <lb/>
Robinson's scheme, not only from publicans and such <reg orig="in-|terested">interested</reg> <lb/>
persons, but from those who might have been <lb/>
<pb n="96" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0267"/>
expected to be friendly; and the bitterest enemy of all <lb/>
was Archdeacon Wright, the principal military chaplain <lb/>
in the place. The grounds of objection were the <reg orig="tee-|totalism">teetotalism</reg> <lb/>
and Bible-teaching that were to form <reg orig="indispens-|able">indispensable</reg> <lb/>
items in the Institute programme, and more than <lb/>
once Miss Robinson received tempting offers of <reg orig="in-|fluential">influential</reg> <lb/>
help if she would only waive these points; but <lb/>
she firmly refused.</p>
<p>There was only one building in Portsmouth which <lb/>
seemed at all suitable for the purpose required, and that <lb/>
was the old "Fountain Inn," in High Street, at that <lb/>
time shut up and disused. But it seemed too large, and <lb/>
Miss Robinson felt she could not dare undertake it.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, having applied for a Government grant of <lb/>
land for a site to build an Institute should no existing <lb/>
house be found suitable, a certain piece, after sundry <lb/>
negotiations, was given, situated near the Gymnasium, <lb/>
and Miss Robinson set to work, travelling from place to <lb/>
place, speaking at meetings in the hope of interesting <lb/>
people in the project, and begging money wherewith to <lb/>
build.</p>
<p>Naturally she mentioned frequently, as an incentive <lb/>
to help, the great need of such an institution as that <lb/>
planned, and the shocking condition of the town. Though <lb/>
keeping well within the bounds of truth, these <reg orig="dis-|closures">disclosures</reg> <lb/>
aroused the ire of many of the townspeople, <lb/>
who seemed desirous to conceal rather than to remedy <lb/>
the evil.</p>
<p>Archdeacon Wright was also busy; he had threatened <lb/>
to "annihilate" the concern, and was doing his best to <lb/>
make good his words. And so successfully did he use <lb/>
the influence of his position that the grant of land was <lb/>
presently revoked, except on condition that the Bible <lb/>
should not be introduced. This Miss Robinson and her <lb/>
<pb entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0268"/>

<head>THE SOLDIERS' INSTITUTE, PORTSMOUTH.</head>
</figure>
<pb n="98" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0269"/>
committee were agreed in refusing to concede, and the <lb/>
site was accordingly relinquished.</p>
<p>Then Miss Robinson resolved to take "The Fountain," <lb/>
and worked harder than ever to collect funds. She <lb/>
secured the old inn, by a deposit of &pound;100 to the owner, <lb/>
in December, 1873; and by visiting numbers of <reg orig="in-|dividuals">individuals</reg> <lb/>
and speaking at most of the large towns in <lb/>
England had, by the end of 1874, collected over &pound;7,000. <lb/>
Of this sum she reckoned that &pound;1,500 was due to the <lb/>
indignation evoked by the bitter letters on the subject <lb/>
which had been addressed to the <hi rend="italic">Standard</hi> by <reg orig="Arch-|deacon">Archdeacon</reg> <lb/>
Wright, and of this fact she subsequently had <lb/>
the pleasure of personally informing him. Part was <lb/>
also traceable to the helpful influence of a little book <lb/>
called <hi rend="italic">Active Service</hi>, written by Miss Ellice Hopkins, <lb/>
and descriptive of Miss Robinson's work, with which <lb/>
that lady keenly sympathised.</p>
<p>Alterations and improvements were pushed forward <lb/>
as rapidly as possible at "The Fountain," and on <reg orig="Sep-|tember">September</reg> <lb/>
10th, 1874, it was formally opened in its new <lb/>
capacity of Soldiers' Institute. Sir J. Hope Grant, Sir <lb/>
Arthur Lawrence, and other military officers and friends <lb/>
from a distance were present, as well as crowds of <lb/>
soldiers, but the one who had done most of all towards <lb/>
bringing the scheme to a successful issue was unable to <lb/>
share in the pleasant excitement of the occasion. Miss <lb/>
Robinson, prostrated, as she had been so many times <lb/>
before, by her noble efforts, was too ill to attend. An <lb/>
illuminated address, however, from two hundred <reg orig="non-|commissioned">non-commissioned</reg> <lb/>
officers of the garrison, expressive of <lb/>
the sincere congratulations and highest esteem of <lb/>
the entire army, was handed to Sir Arthur Lawrence <lb/>
for her.</p>
<p>Miss Robinson now, with her father's sanction and <lb/>
<pb n="99" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0270"/>
assisted by a sufficient income from him, bade a final <lb/>
good-bye to Guildford, and took up her abode at the <lb/>
Portsmouth Institute, where she lived until her <reg orig="retire-|ment">retirement</reg> <lb/>
twenty years later.</p>
<p>From the first the new Institute was gratefully made <lb/>
use of by the class for whom it was intended, though <lb/>
the opposition had by no means ceased. Archdeacon <lb/>
Wright having tried both persuasions and "bullying" in <lb/>
vain to get Miss Robinson to give up holding Institute <lb/>
Bible-classes, took the course of starting a number of <lb/>
new religious and philanthropic agencies of his own, to <lb/>
draw support away from the hated Soldiers' Institute by <lb/>
rivalry. This did not trouble his opponent in the <lb/>
least; she was glad for good to be done by any means, <lb/>
and was decidedly amused to find she had provoked <lb/>
him "to good works, if not to love"! When, a couple <lb/>
of years later, he left the place, she commented in her <lb/>
diary that she was "really rather sorry, as his perpetually <lb/>
running about telling people <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to visit us was a <lb/>
continual advertisement, and brought many out of <lb/>
curiosity."</p>
<p>That year, 1876, was also noteworthy on account of <lb/>
a visit to the Institute from H.R.H. the Duke of <lb/>
Cambridge with a brilliant staff, who went all over <lb/>
the Institute, and expressed very great surprise and <lb/>
pleasure. H.R.H. said he had no idea it was such a <lb/>
place, and wrote in the visitors' book: "I have this <lb/>
day visited and inspected this excellent Institute, and <lb/>
am gratified by all I have seen in it, and by the <reg orig="ad-|mirable">admirable</reg> <lb/>
order in which I found every portion of the <lb/>
premises.&mdash;George."</p>
<p>Some years later the Institute was again visited by <lb/>
the Duke of Cambridge in company with the Prince of <lb/>
Wales. On this occasion Miss Robinson had been <lb/>
<pb n="100" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0271"/>
compelled to deny herself to all visitors; but on being <lb/>
specially asked for by the Prince himself, was taken <lb/>
downstairs in her carrying-chair, when His Royal <lb/>
Highness very kindly shook hands with her, and <lb/>
thanked her for her services to the army.</p>
<figure id="f43" rend="block" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0271">
<head>THE SOLDIERS' INSTITUTE, PORTSMOUTH, FROM THE GARDEN.</head>
</figure>
<p>The new Institute was an inestimable boon when the <lb/>
troopships came in, as at that time every regiment in <lb/>
turn embarked or disembarked at Portsmouth, and <lb/>
there was no provision made for the comfort or even <lb/>
decent shelter of the wives and children until they <lb/>
could be forwarded to their destinations. The poor <lb/>
things were often half-clad, ill, and in every way <lb/>
<pb n="101" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0272"/>
destitute. Many found kindness and nursing, as well <lb/>
as food, lodging, and warm clothing at the Institute; <lb/>
and Miss Robinson also started a refreshment-cart on <lb/>
the jetty, afterwards improved into a shed, where hot <lb/>
coffee, buns, and biscuits were sold to the men and <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">given</hi> to the women and children. This incited the <lb/>
authorities to also put up a waiting-room, where the <lb/>
travellers could sit by a good fire in the interval&mdash;often <lb/>
two hours and more&mdash;between the arrival of the ship <lb/>
and the starting of the train to take them on their <lb/>
journey.</p>
<p>But as our space is almost filled we will here pause <lb/>
to give a complete list of the various institutions for <lb/>
the benefit of soldiers, sailors, and their families, which, <lb/>
by degrees, Miss Robinson founded, in addition to the <lb/>
headquarters of operations at the transformed "<reg orig="Foun-|tain">Fountain</reg>."</p>
<p>1. <hi rend="italic">Two new Recreation-rooms</hi>, a Bible-class-room, and <lb/>
additional bedrooms, obtained by purchasing and <reg orig="pull-|ing">pulling</reg> <lb/>
down an objectionable house next door to the <lb/>
Institute.</p>
<p>2. <hi rend="italic">The providing of Furnished Lodgings</hi> in different <lb/>
parts of the town for the families of soldiers who had <lb/>
married without leave, and who, in those days, found <lb/>
it difficult to obtain apartments anywhere but in <reg orig="public-|houses">public-houses</reg>.</p>
<p>3. <hi rend="italic">A large Lecture Hall</hi>, built on one side of the <lb/>
garden of the "Fountain," where formerly the old tap <lb/>
and stabling stood.</p>
<p>4. <hi rend="italic">A separate House for Officers</hi>, where they could be <lb/>
lodged in apartments and at a tariff suitable to their <lb/>
position.</p>
<p>5. <hi rend="italic">A Recreation Room for Sailor Boys</hi>, who would <lb/>
often swarm all over the Institute and drive people <lb/>
<pb n="102" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0273"/>
nearly out of their wits. This was built at the end of <lb/>
the long garden, with a flat roof reached by outside <lb/>
stairs, and facing Southsea Common and Spithead.</p>
<p>6. <hi rend="italic">A small Institute</hi> at Newport, Isle of Wight.</p>
<p>7. <hi rend="italic">A House for Sailors at Portsea</hi>. This "Sailors' <lb/>
Welcome," with its 250 beds, was a boon to the <reg orig="blue-|jackets">bluejackets</reg> <lb/>
for some years before Miss Weston opened her <lb/>
splendid "Sailors' Rest." There is still room for the <lb/>
good work done by both.</p>
<p>8. <hi rend="italic">A Mission Room at Eastney</hi>. This has since passed <lb/>
into Miss Weston's hands.</p>
<p>9. <hi rend="italic">An Early Coffee House and Mission Room</hi> on the <lb/>
Camber, for fisherfolk and waterside people. This was <lb/>
afterwards superseded by the opening of</p>
<p>10. <hi rend="italic">A Coffee Tavern and Mission Hall</hi> on the site of <lb/>
a public-house and two courts, consisting of seventeen <lb/>
houses in all, the vilest in a vile neighbourhood. This <lb/>
work has since been taken over by the Salvation Army.</p>
<p>11. <hi rend="italic">An Institute at Alexandria, Egypt</hi>. This was <lb/>
founded a year or two after the bombardment, under <lb/>
the supervision of Thomas Tufnell, for many years Miss <lb/>
Robinson's right-hand man in every undertaking. He <lb/>
was formerly in the Queen's Bays, 2nd Dragoon <lb/>
Guards, but sold out of the army at the time of the <lb/>
Autumn Man&oelig;uvres in order to devote himself to Miss <lb/>
Robinson, and was of invaluable service to her.</p>
<p>12. <hi rend="italic">A small Institute at Gosport.</hi></p>
<p>13. <hi rend="italic">A Coffee Palace at Landport.</hi></p>
<p>This latter was a grand enterprise. A plot of land <lb/>
measuring 123 feet by 90 feet was secured in the very <lb/>
best situation in Landport, and on it was erected that <lb/>
magnificent pile of buildings, named "The Speedwell," <lb/>
which can scarcely fail to strike the eye of everybody <lb/>
who comes into Portsmouth by rail. The management <lb/>
<pb n="103" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0274"/>
of this place, however, only remained in the foundress's <lb/>
hands two years, though she has since, notwithstanding <lb/>
its continued success, been often sorry she was <reg orig="per-|suaded">persuaded</reg> <lb/>
to give it up.</p>
<p>From many other of these institutions Miss Robinson <lb/>
has also been compelled, owing to increasing age and <lb/>
infirmities, to withdraw her personal connection; but <lb/>
all are going on well under their respective Boards of <lb/>
Direction, quite independently of the Portsmouth <lb/>
Soldiers' Institute.</p>
<p>In the year 1889 Miss Robinson travelled more than a <lb/>
thousand miles throughout twenty-six English counties <lb/>
to speak on the subject of her life-work, to collect <lb/>
money, and to distribute text-cards and books.</p>
<p>This extraordinary expedition, not the least wonderful <lb/>
of Miss Robinson's many marvellous achievements, was <lb/>
undertaken with the hope of obtaining funds for the <lb/>
Speedwell Coffee Palace and Gospel Hall mentioned <lb/>
above. Let no reader suppose that any latent desire <lb/>
for change or adventure was at the bottom of the <lb/>
scheme, for it involved, as had so much of our heroine's <lb/>
former work, a tremendous conflict between <hi rend="italic">fear</hi> and <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">courage</hi>.</p>
<p>The dread she felt of the physical suffering which <lb/>
was sure to be caused by the travelling itself was only <lb/>
exceeded by her horror, which years of practice had <lb/>
never overcome, of addressing meetings, more <reg orig="particu-|larly">particularly</reg> <lb/>
meetings of fashionable and well-to-do people, <lb/>
which of course was the class she now specially intended <lb/>
to seek.</p>
<p>People so little guessed the truth, however, that they <lb/>
would often say to her, "This must be quite a nice <lb/>
change to you after Portsmouth," or, "I expect you <lb/>
enjoy getting about in this way," when the poor lady <lb/>
<pb n="104" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0275"/>
was enduring such acute neuralgic pain, partly from <lb/>
the jolting of conveyances and partly from the effort <lb/>
of overcoming her own incurable shyness when in <lb/>
company, that "even a handshake would jar her with <lb/>
a thrill of new agony."</p>
<p>The following, however, is General H. D. Taylor's <lb/>
description of Miss Robinson when he listened to her <lb/>
in 1879:&mdash;</p>
<p>"When Miss Robinson was introduced to us I saw <lb/>
one whose face was marked with those unmistakable <lb/>
lines which tell of protracted suffering. At first sight <lb/>
of her most people would have thought, 'Surely this <lb/>
is not a person who can have done any great work, <lb/>
or sustained any special exertion either of mind or <lb/>
body'! But the light in her eye when she stood up to <lb/>
speak, giving token of an enthusiasm burning within, <lb/>
would probably have caused them to change their <lb/>
opinion. I do not think I ever heard anything more <lb/>
interesting, more affecting, and more instructive than <lb/>
her speech."</p>
<p>Miss Robinson's earlier journeys were performed by <lb/>
rail, but before 1889 she had become such a confirmed <lb/>
invalid that she could only travel lying down. A coach, <lb/>
however, was constructed that would accommodate six <lb/>
inside passengers in addition to the principal occupant <lb/>
and her bed, though practically her nerves were in <lb/>
such a state that she could bear no one in it beside <lb/>
herself.</p>
<p>In this conveyance Miss Robinson journeyed up hill <lb/>
and down, through good roads and bad, for 103 days, <lb/>
from June 11th to September 21st, 1889. And the <lb/>
result was sixty-three addresses delivered, 12,000 small <lb/>
books, etc., distributed, &pound;43 worth of books sold, and <lb/>
&pound;1,402 collected.</p>
<pb n="105" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0276"/>
<p>In the summer of 1891 a second tour was carried <lb/>
through in the same way, this time embracing many <lb/>
towns in Scotland. Nearly 2,000 miles were traversed, <lb/>
and 102 addresses given, but only &pound;1,043 collected, <lb/>
besides &pound;213 in private donations; so, proportionately, <lb/>
this second tour was far less successful from a pecuniary <lb/>
point of view than the first.</p>
<p>Miss Robinson's third and last itinerary was <reg orig="accom-|plished">accomplished</reg> <lb/>
in 1893, when, the management of the Soldiers' <lb/>
Institute having been placed in the hands of the Rev. <lb/>
J. Gelson Gregson, the foundress and her lady-helpers <lb/>
thought it advisable to withdraw from the work.</p>
<p>On this occasion the primary object of the journey <lb/>
was to collect money to clear off the debt remaining <lb/>
on the Institute at Alexandria. The towns visited <lb/>
were in Wilts, Dorset, and Devonshire, and on Miss <lb/>
Robinson's return she settled down at length to the life <lb/>
of rest and quiet which she had denied herself in the <lb/>
interests of the soldiers for so many long years. "The <lb/>
Hut," at Burley, in the New Forest, a building of <lb/>
primitive simplicity, erected for her and after her own <lb/>
design, was now to be the home of the tired-out <lb/>
"Soldier's Friend."</p>
<p>Quite crippled by the spinal complaint which had <lb/>
ever been growing worse, often causing hours of agony <lb/>
even when the heroic sufferer was most active in her <lb/>
labours, racked with pains in the head caused by <reg orig="pro-|tracted">protracted</reg> <lb/>
overwork, deaf, and a martyr to nervous <reg orig="irrit-|ability">irritability</reg>, <lb/>
the subject of this sketch, the reader doubtless <lb/>
imagines, thenceforward devoted the autumn of her life <lb/>
to well-earned repose.</p>
<p>But our narrative closes with the unexpected. After <lb/>
nearly six years' experience of masculine management, <lb/>
the Portsmouth Soldiers' Institute was brought to such <lb/>
<pb n="106" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0277"/>
a low ebb, both as regards finance and popularity, that <lb/>
Miss Robinson felt strongly impelled to return to her <lb/>
former post, if only to re-organise the band of ladies <lb/>
under whose care alone the place seemed likely to be <lb/>
really prosperous.</p>
<p>Therefore, to everyone's astonishment and delight, on <lb/>
November 1st, 1898, the "Soldiers' Friend" with two <lb/>
lady-helpers returned to Portsmouth, and, needless to <lb/>
say, they received a warm welcome.</p>
<p>Twelve months later Miss Robinson was able to <lb/>
record in her Report that "to-day &hellip; through the <lb/>
loving labours of my dear helpers, the House is more <lb/>
happy and homelike than ever it was."</p>
<p>Since then Miss Robinson, though too infirm to live <lb/>
at the Institute, has in her home at Burley been able as <lb/>
Hon. Superintendent to keep in close touch with all that <lb/>
is being done there. The various agencies are carried <lb/>
on by five ladies, all of whom laboured under her in <lb/>
former years, and a good trustworthy staff of paid <lb/>
helpers.</p>
<p>In conclusion, with the sad war in South Africa <lb/>
testing the resources of the work and the workers both <lb/>
at Portsmouth and Southampton to the utmost, we can <lb/>
only join in the earnest prayer of thousands that the <lb/>
"Soldier's Friend" may yet be long spared to direct, as <lb/>
she only knows how, the labours which are fraught with <lb/>
so inestimable a blessing to our noble troops in every <lb/>
part of the world.</p>

for the millions of workers who stream out of London <lb/>

the London Corn Market on the first and third <lb/>
Monday in each month. He was therefore regarded <lb/>
by his neighbours as a prodigy of activity and business <lb/>
capacity." And he and his wife brought up their family <lb/>
of girls and boys on lines which in those days must <lb/>
have seemed quite shocking to their old-fashioned and <lb/>
slow-going neighbours.</p>
<p>Millicent and her sisters&mdash;the eldest of whom is <lb/>
now Mrs. Garrett Anderson, M.D., one of the first of <lb/>
women doctors, while another was the late Mrs. Cowell, <lb/>
for several years a member of the London School Board&mdash; <lb/>
were not restricted to the piano-tinkling, water-colour <lb/>
dabbling, and crewel and embroidery working, which <lb/>
were by many considered the only feminine and proper <lb/>
recreations for young ladies of that day. For they <lb/>
were permitted and encouraged to talk freely on <lb/>
political and social subjects, to have opinions and to <lb/>
express them, and to generally interest themselves in <lb/>
the wide world outside Aldeburgh as well as in the new <lb/>
ideas which were even then beginning to stir the hearts <lb/>
of many to a consideration of the individuality, powers, <lb/>
and wrongs of women.</p>
<p>"I cannot remember a time," said Mrs. Fawcett to <lb/>
that indefatigable interviewer, Miss Sarah Tooley, "when <lb/>
<pb n="110" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0281"/>
I was not interested in political questions, for my <lb/>
parents encouraged family discussion on topics of the <lb/>
day, and my father liked my sisters and me to read <lb/>
the newspapers. I was reared in an atmosphere <lb/>
saturated with progressive ideas. I read Buckle and <lb/>
Mill, and the standard poets, novelists and historians, <lb/>
not, however, to the neglect of domestic matters, for in <lb/>
such my mother most thoroughly trained her daughters."</p>
<p>That Mr. Newson Garrett was himself one of the <lb/>
pioneers of the emancipation of women is proved by <lb/>
his warm sympathy with the aspirations of his eldest <lb/>
daughter, Elizabeth, who, soon after she passed out of <lb/>
her teens, resolved on the, at that time extraordinary, <lb/>
course of choosing for herself a profession; and, what <lb/>
must have seemed still more startling to the sleepy <lb/>
good folk of Aldeburgh in the fifties, selected for that <lb/>
purpose the study of medicine.</p>
<p>From 1860 to 1865, while Millicent Garrett was in <lb/>
the most impressionable years of her girlhood, was her <lb/>
sister perseveringly but vainly seeking admission at <lb/>
nearly a score of colleges and halls in Great Britain <lb/>
which had the power of giving medical degrees and <lb/>
conferring the licence to practise. Gifted, earnest, well <lb/>
prepared by a good education in other branches of a <lb/>
university training, Miss Garrett was everywhere refused <lb/>
admittance simply because she was a woman!</p>
<p>We can imagine how the injustice of the thing burnt <lb/>
itself in upon the soul of the enthusiastic younger girl, <lb/>
and we can also picture her triumph when at last it was <lb/>
legally decided that the Apothecaries' Hall could not <lb/>
reject Miss Garrett's application, as there was a clause <lb/>
in the Apothecaries Act providing that "all persons" <lb/>
should be received to examination who were properly <lb/>
prepared for it.</p>
<pb n="111" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0282"/>
<p>It had probably never entered the minds of the <lb/>
framers of that Act that any but male "persons" <lb/>
would ever have the temerity to desire thus to <reg orig="dis-|tinguish">distinguish</reg> <lb/>

<p>The <reg orig="broad-|mindedness">broadmindedness</reg> <lb/>
and <lb/>
chivalry of the medical students of the "nobler sex" <lb/>
at that time may be judged from the fact that they <lb/>
objected to sitting with a woman at some of the classes, <lb/>
<pb n="112" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0283"/>
thus compelling her to go to the expense of receiving <lb/>
these lectures privately.</p>
<p>Having, through Miss Garrett's persistence and the <lb/>
grand success in the public examination by which she <lb/>
won for herself the position of a legally qualified <lb/>
English practitioner, realised the awful possibilities of <lb/>
that one weak place in their fence, the Apothecaries' <lb/>
Hall took immediate steps to make sure, by the <reg orig="enact-|ment">enactment</reg> <lb/>
of a clever by-law, that no other female invader <lb/>
should disturb the exclusiveness of their lecture rooms, <lb/>
and for some years afterwards all women wishing to <lb/>
emulate the victory of Elizabeth Garrett, L.S.A., were <lb/>
compelled to seek their training abroad.</p>
<p>All of which facts, no doubt, greatly helped to mould <lb/>
the convictions of the future fervent defender of the <lb/>
principle that women are entitled to equal educational <lb/>
and professional facilities with men.</p>
<p>For herself, however, Millicent Garrett had to be <lb/>
content with such advantages as the period offered. <lb/>
"A governess of the old-fashioned type, who swore by <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Mangnall's Questions</hi>," and two years' finishing at a <lb/>
suburban boarding-school, made up, we are told, her <lb/>
scholastic opportunities. But the development of mind <lb/>
is not a question of classes and teachers merely; the <lb/>
best and surest growth is from the inside. The fruits <lb/>
of self-cultivation are incomparably preferable to the <lb/>
hothouse productions of the cramming system, or the <lb/>
artificial "accomplishments" that used to be hung upon <lb/>
young persons, like toys upon a Christmas-tree, during <lb/>
the latter years of their school-life. Millicent Garrett <lb/>
was highly educated in the best meaning of the term. <lb/>
And that she had received precisely the kind of training <lb/>
which was specially adapted to fit her for the part she <lb/>
was destined to play in public as well as private life <lb/>
was soon to be proved.</p>

<head><hi rend="bold">CHAPTER II. <lb/>
EYES TO THE BLIND.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">When</hi> still under twenty years of age the subject <lb/>
of our sketch became acquainted with a most <lb/>
powerful and interesting personality&mdash;that of Henry <lb/>
Fawcett, a young Cambridge professor who was visiting <lb/>
in the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>This young man, physically almost a giant, for he <lb/>
stood six feet three inches in height, with corresponding <lb/>
muscular development, was also possessed of that <lb/>
marvellous strength of character which enabled him to <lb/>
triumph grandly over one of the greatest disabilities <lb/>
which a human being can suffer.</p>
<p>Having become totally blind as the result of a gun <lb/>
accident at the age of twenty-five, Henry Fawcett <lb/>
determined on nothing short of a perfect victory over <lb/>
his affliction. He held that "a blind man should act <lb/>
and be treated as far as possible like a seeing man," and <lb/>
his biographer, Leslie Stephen, tells us that, in <reg orig="accord-|ance">accordance</reg> <lb/>
with this conviction, he perseveringly kept up <lb/>
those recreations to which before his misfortune he had <lb/>
been devoted. He was very fond of both walking and <lb/>
skating; he cultivated a memory of the paths he had <lb/>
known, and enjoyed unfamiliar ones if his companions <lb/>
would describe to him the scenery they passed through. <lb/>
He was also skilled in horsemanship, and so great were <lb/>
his nerve and his confidence in both himself and the <lb/>
animal he rode that he would join in a gallop with the <lb/>
harriers over Newmarket Heath.</p>
<p>Professor Fawcett's favourite sport, however, was <lb/>
fishing, which, we are told, he pursued "with remarkable <lb/>
<pb n="114" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0285"/>
skill and unflagging interest, both in the salmon rivers <lb/>
of the North and the trout streams of Hampshire."</p>
<p>We have mentioned the bodily achievements of this <lb/>
remarkable man before his mental endowments, because <lb/>
in one so heavily handicapped as he they are the more <lb/>
striking, and indicative by their rarity under such <lb/>
circumstances of the spirit which fortified him. But <lb/>
at the time of Henry Fawcett's memorable visit to <lb/>
Aldeburgh he was already Professor of Political <lb/>
Economy at Cambridge and Member of Parliament for <lb/>
Brighton in the Liberal interest.</p>
<p>Such, then, was the man who was one day quite <lb/>
unexpectedly introduced to the Misses Garrett. He <lb/>
came upon them characteristically employed, that is <lb/>
to say, their occupations were fairly representative of <lb/>
their culture and capabilities, for the reading of <reg orig="Shake-|speare">Shakespeare</reg> <lb/>
and the darning of stockings was the <reg orig="entertain-|ment">entertainment</reg> <lb/>
going forward at the time, suggesting that though <lb/>
the minds of these young ladies were cultivated beyond <lb/>
the average it had not been at the expense of what <lb/>
some might consider more useful and feminine <reg orig="accom-|plishments">accomplishments</reg>.</p>
<p>What first drew Professor Fawcett towards Millicent <lb/>
Garrett we are not informed. It was, alas! not her <lb/>
beauty, though of that she possessed more than a <lb/>
common share, for, as a north country mill-girl once <lb/>
said, after seeing young Mrs. Fawcett and hearing her <lb/>
speak, "To think she's so bonny, and &hellip; <hi rend="italic">he never see <lb/>
her!</hi>"</p>
<p>On her side, we can well imagine, it was an innate <lb/>
womanliness of nature that the most progressive of <lb/>
theories might not chill or check which inclined her to <lb/>
a life of helpful devotion to the brave blind man. This <lb/>
one fact, that Millicent Garrett was willing to give <lb/>
<pb n="115" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0286"/>
herself, in her bright, attractive girlhood, to be the <reg orig="life-|companion">life-companion</reg> <lb/>
of one so afflicted, should for ever close the <lb/>
mouths of the few who, irritated by the force of her <lb/>
pleas for the down-trodden of her sex, have at times <lb/>
stigmatised her as a "noisy virago," or ignorantly <reg orig="as-|sumed">assumed</reg> <lb/>
her to be a kind of man-hating Amazon in <lb/>
"bloomer" costume.</p>
<p>It was in 1867 that Professor Henry Fawcett and <lb/>
Millicent Garrett were married, and very soon after, the <lb/>
young bride began to take an active part in those <lb/>
social movements for which, in the quiet but intellectual <lb/>
home-life at Aldeburgh, she had been unconsciously <lb/>
preparing.</p>
<p>The cause of Women's Suffrage was among the first <lb/>
to appeal to the sympathies of young Mrs. Fawcett, as <lb/>
it has ever been dearest to her heart.</p>
<p>It was during the early days of her married life that <lb/>
she first spoke publicly on behalf of granting the <reg orig="parlia-|mentary">parliamentary</reg> <lb/>
vote to women. This was at a meeting <lb/>
convened by Mr. and Mrs. Peter Taylor and John <lb/>
Stuart Mill, and her appearance and manner on that <lb/>
occasion, as well as the quiet reasonableness of her <lb/>
arguments, produced an excellent impression upon her <lb/>
audience.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the fact that her speech was much <lb/>
less approvingly regarded by certain members of <reg orig="Parlia-|ment">Parliament</reg> <lb/>
who came to hear of it, she followed it up by <lb/>
reading an address in favour of the same measure at a <lb/>
public meeting in Brighton.</p>
<p>It was considered by many that Professor Fawcett <lb/>
seriously endangered his prospects in that constituency <lb/>
by allowing his wife's name to be thus openly associated <lb/>
with such unpopular views. But to him, as to her, it <lb/>
was a question of right rather than of popularity. They <lb/>
<pb n="116" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0287"/>
risked all for the sake of what they felt to be true <lb/>
justice, and lost nothing.</p>
<p>Truly domesticated, both by tastes and training, it was <lb/>
indeed not in contempt for the home as woman's proper <lb/>
sphere, but in honour of it, and in the endeavour to <lb/>
raise it to its highest ideal, that Mrs. Fawcett left the <lb/>
shade of domestic privacy and mounted the public <lb/>
platform. "It is the home which she wishes to see <lb/>
more considered in our political life." But not until <lb/>
both sexes have their rights equally studied does she <lb/>
believe it possible for women to do their absolute best <lb/>
for their husbands and children.</p>
<p>Mrs. Fawcett's own life as wife and mother has been <lb/>
exemplary. She was most truly her husband's right <lb/>
hand, assisting him and furthering his interests in every <lb/>
possible way, both in public and private; and the <reg orig="Pro-|fessor">Professor</reg>, <lb/>
we are assured, "invariably acknowledged with <lb/>
due gratitude the assistance he received from his wife's <lb/>
revision and suggestions." Theirs seems to have been <lb/>
an ideal marriage.</p>
<p>On the occasion already referred to, when Mrs. Fawcett <lb/>
was thrown from her horse at Brighton, her husband's <lb/>
grief, his biographer tells us, was most pathetic to <lb/>
witness. In his blindness, unable to prove for himself <lb/>
how much she was injured, his great love made him <lb/>
even fear and suspect that the worst was being concealed <lb/>
from him, and that when they told him she was <reg orig="un-|conscious">unconscious</reg> <lb/>
it was only to prepare him for the terrible <lb/>
truth that she was actually dead. Strong, courageous, <lb/>
and self-controlled as we know he was, we are told that <lb/>
he wept passionately.</p>
<p>The next day, when hope was at last assured, he met <lb/>
a large gathering in the Dome, and in thanking his <lb/>
constituency for past support, said that if he had <reg orig="over-|come">overcome</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="117" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0288"/>
obstacles, it was because of assistance given him <lb/>
by others, and because he had had "a helpmate whose <lb/>
political judgment was much less frequently at fault <lb/>
than his own." And this, those who knew him best <lb/>
have testified, was no empty phrase, but the expression <lb/>
of his genuine feeling.</p>
<p>"There were times," says a writer in <hi rend="italic">Great Thoughts</hi>, <lb/>
commenting on the singularly harmonious domestic <lb/>
relations of this gifted pair, "when she being temporarily <lb/>
absent, he would put off a decision of great moment in <lb/>
his career until he was able to obtain her opinion, and <lb/>
on all occasions he was acutely sensible of the value of <lb/>
her advice and encouragement."</p>
<p>Of the benefits which Professor Fawcett himself <reg orig="con-|ferred">conferred</reg> <lb/>
on the country, we may only speak in passing. <lb/>
Best known to many people as "the blind <reg orig="Postmaster-|General">Postmaster-General</reg>," <lb/>
he will always be gratefully remembered as <lb/>
the inaugurator of the useful Parcel Post which came <lb/>
into operation in 1882, and of the cheapened telegrams <lb/>
instituted a few years later. Always an earnest <reg orig="advo-|cate">advocate</reg> <lb/>
of thrift, he encouraged small depositors in the <lb/>
Post Office Savings Bank by the introduction of "<reg orig="stamp-|slip">stamp-slip</reg> <lb/>
deposits," whereby the poorest labourer or the <lb/>
smallest schoolboy may save up a penny at a time by <lb/>
buying postage stamps and sticking them one by one <lb/>
on a form provided for the purpose, until the number of <lb/>
twelve being reached, they will be entered as a shilling <lb/>
deposit in the Savings Bank.</p>
<p>Professor Fawcett, inspired and assisted by his wife, <lb/>
also took especial pleasure in the extension of Post Office <lb/>
appointments to women, and hundreds of girl-clerks and <lb/>
sorters now so pleasantly and lucratively employed at <lb/>
St. Martin's-le-Grand and Queen Victoria Street have <lb/>
him to thank in great measure for their present position.</p>
<pb n="118" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0289"/>
<p>It is sad to think that so useful a life should have <lb/>
been cut short in its prime, but so it was. Professor <lb/>
Fawcett died in November, 1884, after a brief illness, <lb/>
from pleurisy and congestion of the lungs, during which <lb/>
he was attended by his wife's sister, Mrs. Garrett <lb/>
Anderson, and Sir Andrew Clark.</p>
<p>Very touching letters Mrs. Fawcett received from her <lb/>
husband's working-men admirers at this time, proving <lb/>
the gratitude with which his efforts and advice had been <lb/>
regarded.</p>
<p>One epistle, signed by four carpenters, two <reg orig="brick-|layers">bricklayers</reg>, <lb/>
a blacksmith, a postmaster, and a clerk, expressed <lb/>
the feeling that they had "lost a personal friend, and <lb/>
that a great man had gone from us." Another, with <lb/>
singular straightforwardness and simplicity, says that <lb/>
"several of his old friends at Brighton Railway Works <lb/>
has wished me to ask you privately how you are situated <lb/>
in a pecuniary sense," and goes on to beg her to accept <lb/>
a "penny subscription" from the working classes of this <lb/>
country "for the public and striking services rendered <lb/>
by one of the best men since Edmund Burke."</p>
<p>Happily, the widow, while deeply affected by the <lb/>
kind and generous feeling which prompted this offer, <lb/>
was able to reply that "her husband's forethought and <lb/>
prudence had left her in a position to make it improper <lb/>
for her to accept either a pension or a subscription."</p>
<p>To this the writer of the letter responded, "Our men <lb/>
at the Railway Works say that you are entitled to all <lb/>
honour for refusing a pension or subscription from the <lb/>
working men; also that your dear husband and our <lb/>
best friend has practised what he always preached to <lb/>
us&mdash;private thrift."</p>
<p>It would be well if all moralists and teachers could <lb/>
win a like tribute to the consistency of their maxims <lb/>
with their own rule of life.</p>

THE MOTHER OF A SENIOR WRANGLER</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Any</hi> record of the life and work of Mrs. Fawcett <lb/>
would be signally incomplete without something <lb/>
beyond a casual reference to her proudest achievement, <lb/>
namely, the successful rearing of that <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italic">rara avis</hi></foreign>, a lady <lb/>
senior wrangler.</p>
<p>The union of Professor Fawcett and his wife was <lb/>
blessed with but one child, a girl, who received the <lb/>
name of Philippa.</p>
<p>When this little maiden was still only a baby her <lb/>
mother had already begun to take keen interest in the <lb/>
higher education of women; and the first meeting for <lb/>
the purpose of organising lectures for ladies in <reg orig="connec-|tion">connection</reg> <lb/>
with the University of Cambridge was held in Mrs. <lb/>
Fawcett's drawing-room.</p>
<p>The result of this meeting was, first, a course of <lb/>
lectures, which were so appreciated that no less than <lb/>
eighty ladies availed themselves of the privilege of <lb/>
attending it; next, the establishment of a residence <lb/>
near Cambridge for women students; and, lastly, in 1875, <lb/>
the founding of Newnham College itself, of which Miss <lb/>
Philippa Fawcett, as "a case"&mdash;to again quote Miss <lb/>
Tooley&mdash;"of poetic justice not often met with in real <lb/>
life," was destined to become the most distinguished <lb/>
student.</p>
<p>Little Philippa was from her earliest years encouraged <lb/>
in that self-reliance and independence which her mother <lb/>
so highly values as a basis of human character. While <lb/>
quite young she was allowed to go out unattended, and <lb/>
<pb n="120" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0291"/>
guarded only by the maternal admonition that "<reg orig="No-|body">Nobody</reg> <lb/>
ever gets run over except foolish people."</p>
<p>Later on, when, making her daily journeys to <reg orig="Clap-|ham">Clapham</reg> <lb/>
High School and back, the child was annoyed by <lb/>
certain rude specimens of the rougher sex, she had <lb/>
spirit enough to turn and send them flying with an <lb/>
onslaught from her stout umbrella. Indeed, it was one <lb/>
article in Miss Philippa's social creed that a girl was as <lb/>
good as a boy any day, if not better. "She had never <lb/>
learned to rest content as a woman with the second rate <lb/>
and second best deemed proper for women"; and she <lb/>
measured her own attainments, not with those of other <lb/>
girls, but with the performances of the youths with <lb/>
whom she competed in examinations.</p>
<p>As to physical culture, we may be sure that Mrs. <lb/>
Fawcett's daughter was not trammelled by antiquated <lb/>
proprieties, or hindered in the development of limb and <lb/>
muscle by the ridiculous prohibitions as to this and that <lb/>
which a "young lady" might not attempt to do, <reg orig="pre-|vailing">prevailing</reg> <lb/>
in Millicent Garrett's own girlhood, and, as some <lb/>
of us remember to our cost, even a few years later.</p>
<p>A pretty water-colour portrait of Miss Fawcett at <lb/>
the age of twelve seems to us fairly characteristic of <lb/>
the child and her up-bringing. Perched in a most <lb/>
unconventionally comfortable attitude in the fork of <lb/>
a cherry tree, clad in a loose blouse, a shady hat, and <lb/>
tennis shoes, the little maiden sits absorbed in a book. <lb/>
We are quite prepared to imagine that this is a treatise <lb/>
on Latin grammar or mathematics, in both of which <lb/>
she signally excelled, but it may have been a book <lb/>
of fairy tales, which would certainly seem more in <lb/>
harmony with the reader's sylvan surroundings. For <lb/>
the Senior Wrangler, in her childhood, "romped and <lb/>
ran wild in field and garden like a young colt," played <lb/>
<pb n="121" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0292"/>
with dolls, and listened to silly stories as most ordinary <lb/>
little girls will do if allowed the chance. Simple feminine <lb/>
accomplishments were not meanwhile neglected. Mrs. <lb/>
Fawcett is an expert needlewoman herself, and her <lb/>
daughter, we are assured, "can make everything she <lb/>
wears except her boots."</p>
<p>Mrs. Fawcett was, however, one of those wise parents <lb/>
who do not expect perfection in every branch of <reg orig="learn-|ing">learning</reg> <lb/>
from every child, and she was among the first to <lb/>
recognise the fact, now pretty generally acknowledged, <lb/>
that for a girl without special musical taste to spend <lb/>
hours upon hours practising on the piano is waste of <lb/>
energy that might be turned to better account.</p>
<p>Philippa did not "take to" music, as the phrase goes, <lb/>
and she was not forced to study it. Languages were her <lb/>
delight, and her progress in Latin, we are told, "soon <lb/>
taxed the teaching resources of a girls' 'High School,' <lb/>
and nearly determined her upon a classical course of <lb/>
study." From thence she went to University College, <lb/>
and there was "neck-and-neck in successive trials with <lb/>
the two or three men who fell just behind her in the <lb/>
final test of the Tripos."</p>
<p>But it was Newnham College, in June, 1890, which <lb/>
beheld Miss Fawcett's most brilliant success. In that <lb/>
year scholastic circles were thrilled, and the advocates <lb/>
of the higher education of women were enthusiastically <lb/>
triumphant at the news that Miss Philippa Fawcett had <lb/>
been placed "above the Senior Wrangler" in the great <lb/>
contest of the mathematical year at Cambridge. "On <lb/>
the same day," to quote once more from an able article <lb/>
on Mrs. Fawcett and her daughter in <hi rend="italic">The Review of <lb/>
Reviews</hi>, to which we are already considerably indebted, <lb/>
"a party of processionists returning from Hyde Park <lb/>
went round by Mrs. Fawcett's house in Gower Street <lb/>
<pb n="122" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0293"/>
and mingled with hearty cheers the cries of 'Mrs. <lb/>
Fawcett!' and 'Senior Wrangler!'"</p>
<p>A proud moment, truly, for both mother and daughter, <lb/>
and a unique event in the annals of education. A less <lb/>
sensible mother, a less humble-minded, simple-hearted <lb/>
student might well have had their heads turned by it. <lb/>
But great honours, unlike great riches, seldom come <lb/>
to those who are unfit to carry them, and the intellects <lb/>
of this remarkable pair are too well trained, too <lb/>
thoroughly ballasted with common-sense, for them <lb/>
to be unbalanced even by a victory which brought <lb/>
their names into nearly every newspaper, and sent them <lb/>
echoing half over the English-speaking world.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">It</hi> was when reading aloud to her blind husband, for <lb/>

of Political Economy at Cambridge, that young <lb/>

<p>We may here briefly state for the benefit of those <lb/>

</figure>
many who agree with her, to their firm conviction that <lb/>
the hitherto silent sex should have a voice in the framing <lb/>
of the statutes which they are called upon to obey.</p>
<pb n="124" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0295"/>
<p>In the first place, it is notorious that the laws dealing <lb/>
with the relationship of the sexes, with morality, with <lb/>
divorce, and with many of the questions affecting the <lb/>
welfare of children which arise out of these, are not <lb/>
just and equal. The advantage is greatly on the man's <lb/>
side. Nay, more; a good woman has often a poor <lb/>
chance against a bad man. In some circumstances an <lb/>
immoral father may claim and enforce the control of <lb/>
his children instead of his virtuous wife. And in cases <lb/>
where both parents have done wrong the disgrace and <lb/>
responsibility fall far more heavily on the woman than <lb/>
on the man, though she is generally much less able to <lb/>
bear it.</p>
<p>Mr. Gladstone himself, when speaking on the Women's <lb/>
Disabilities Removal Bill in 1871, admitted that the <lb/>
Divorce Act introduced a "new and gross inequality <lb/>
against women, and in favour of men," and that in <lb/>
other matters connected with the question of <reg orig="matri-|monial">matrimonial</reg> <lb/>
infidelity "the English law does women much <lb/>
less than justice." In conclusion, although unable to <lb/>
give his full support to the Bill under consideration, the <lb/>
great Liberal leader besought all those "who wished <lb/>
well to their country" to devise some means by which <lb/>
women could exercise political influence "through a <lb/>
safe and well-adjusted alteration in the law as to <lb/>
political power."</p>
<p>One M.P., however, opposed the above measure so <lb/>
violently and in such coarse terms that, as is the case <lb/>
with all excessive and intolerant opposition, he really <lb/>
did the cause more good than harm, for in many cases <lb/>
his speech aroused the sympathy of those who were <lb/>
previously indifferent. "If that is how men speak of <lb/>
women," said some, "it is not fit that they should have <lb/>
the uncontrolled power of making laws for them."</p>
<pb n="125" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0296"/>
<p>Nevertheless, the Women's Suffrage societies, to quote <lb/>
from Mrs. Fawcett's own able article on "The Woman <lb/>
Question in Europe," "seek for the suffrage on behalf of <lb/>
those women, and those women only, who fulfil all the <lb/>
qualifications which the law demands of the male <lb/>
elector; that is, for householders in boroughs, the <lb/>
owners of freeholds, and the renters of land and houses <lb/>
above a certain value in counties. &hellip; Whether these <lb/>
conditions are in themselves expedient &hellip; is another <lb/>
matter which it concerns the community very seriously <lb/>
to consider; it is, however, the principle on which <lb/>
Women's Suffrage societies have always acted not to <lb/>
enter in any way into the general question of the <lb/>
conditions imposed on electors, but to say to Parliament <lb/>
and to the English people, 'You have fixed these <reg orig="con-|ditions">conditions</reg> <lb/>
as you believe to be for the best; you have <lb/>
spent years in considering what they shall be; we <lb/>
accept your decision, and only ask that all who fulfil <lb/>
these conditions shall be admitted to the privileges they <lb/>
confer.'"</p>
<p>That most avenues of remunerative employment were <lb/>
wholly closed to women at the time Mrs. Fawcett <reg orig="com-|menced">commenced</reg> <lb/>
her campaign, and that this constituted another <lb/>
serious grievance is indisputable, the experiences of her <lb/>
own sister furnishing a fair example of the treatment <lb/>
an enterprising woman was likely to receive from the <lb/>
sex which was in possession of nearly every post worth <lb/>
having. And, worse still, before the passing of the <lb/>
Married Women's Property Act in 1882 a husband had <lb/>
complete control over all possessions given or left to his <lb/>
wife, as well as all moneys earned by her personal <lb/>
labour, and might sell, spend, or make away with them <lb/>
in any manner he pleased.</p>
<p>All these things considered, it seemed to Mrs. Fawcett <lb/>
<pb n="126" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0297"/>
that for women householders, contributing to the <lb/>
revenues of the country in equal proportion to the men, <lb/>
to still be debarred from representation in the making of <lb/>
the laws and from having any control over the national <lb/>
expenditure, was an injustice not to be passively endured. <lb/>
To again quote her own words, the granting of the <lb/>
vote to women seemed "the only means of cleansing <lb/>
the Statute Book from the laws that are oppressive to <lb/>
their sex."</p>
<p>So she arose to use her voice, her gift of clear <lb/>
exposition, her persuasiveness of address, and the <lb/>
advantages of her social position, on behalf of her dumb <lb/>
sisters. She spoke to the masses in school-houses and <lb/>
halls all over the country, and to the classes in their <lb/>
own drawing-rooms. The latter gatherings, we are <lb/>
told, were often attended by ladies who could not be <lb/>
induced to go to a public Suffrage meeting, and Miss <lb/>
Tooley relates that she heard one lady, "who was <lb/>
evidently a rabid opponent of Women's Suffrage, and <lb/>
had come under protest to a friend's house to hear Mrs. <lb/>
Fawcett speak, say, 'Well, I do think Mrs. Fawcett <lb/>
ought to have the vote,' though," adds Miss Tooley, <lb/>
"she seemed doubtful whether it would be safe to <lb/>
extend female Suffrage further."</p>
<p>Mrs. Fawcett also feels and speaks warmly of the <lb/>
duties and responsibilities of parents and others having <lb/>
the care of children. Liberal and advanced as are her <lb/>
views on the subject of education, she is by no means in <lb/>
favour of relieving the thriftless father of all concern <lb/>
about his children's schooling by making it free to all <lb/>
and unbranded by the stigma of pauperism. Indeed, <lb/>
she advocates no system, however merciful and beautiful <lb/>
it may seem to amiable people who do not go very <lb/>
deeply into things, that may tend to weaken individual <lb/>
<pb n="127" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0298"/>
character and the sense of personal responsibility. She <lb/>
would have every human being trained to stand up <lb/>
bravely upon his or her own feet, to be nobly <reg orig="in-|dependent">independent</reg>, <lb/>
and to resist temptation to sin.</p>
<p>To the moral dangers which beset young women and <lb/>
girls Mrs. Fawcett is keenly alive. She was among the, <lb/>
in some quarters, much misrepresented band who <lb/>
espoused the cause of the overworked children <reg orig="em-|ployed">employed</reg> <lb/>
in Christmas pantomimes, and sought to bring <lb/>
them under the protection of the Factory Acts, while <lb/>
the National Vigilance Association has ever found in <lb/>
her a warm and practical supporter.</p>
<p>Thirty years ago, when Mrs. Fawcett commenced her <lb/>
efforts for the good of her fellow-women, it was so <lb/>
remarkable a thing for a female voice to be heard in <lb/>
public that she and her friends ventured only to read <lb/>
papers, instead of making speeches in the ordinary way.</p>
<p>From the first, however, this pioneer among lady <lb/>
lecturers had the countenance and support of the <lb/>
majority of the most intellectual women of the time. <lb/>
At the earliest meetings at which she spoke, at the <lb/>
Assembly Rooms, Manchester, in 1868, in Birmingham <lb/>
in the same year, and in London in 1869, she had the <lb/>
sympathy if not the personal presence of such women <lb/>
as Mrs. Somerville, Harriet Martineau, Florence <lb/>
Nightingale, Mrs. Browning, Miss Anna Swanwick, <lb/>
Miss Cobbe, Mrs. Grote, Mrs. Ritchie &lpar;Miss Thackeray&rpar;, <lb/>
Miss Mary Carpenter, and Mrs. Jameson.</p>
<p>At a gathering of women held in St. James's Hall, <lb/>
London, some ten years later, Mrs. Fawcett found <lb/>
herself in the company of quite an imposing array of <lb/>
lady speakers, which included Lady Harberton, Mrs. <lb/>
Scatcherd, Mrs. Shearer, Miss Becker, Miss Tod &lpar;of <lb/>
Belfast&rpar;, Miss Biggs, Mrs. Alfred Osler, Mrs. MacLaren <lb/>
<pb n="128" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0299"/>
and her sister, Mrs. Lucas, Mrs. Helen Clark &lpar;eldest <lb/>
daughter of John Bright&rpar;, Miss Jessie Craigen, Miss <lb/>
Jane Cobden, Mrs. Fawcett's cousin, Miss Rhoda <lb/>
Garrett &lpar;of architectural and house-decorating fame&rpar;, <lb/>
and many others.</p>
<p>At this and similar meetings held in the chief towns <lb/>
of England about that time, we are told that there were <lb/>
"overwhelming crowds and great enthusiasm, <reg orig="accom-|panied">accompanied</reg> <lb/>
by perfect order and good temper."</p>
<p>As to the propriety of a woman standing upon a <lb/>
public platform to say anything she may have to say <lb/>
that is worth saying, there is nowadays very little <lb/>
inimical opinion; but for the conversion of any who <lb/>
may yet have doubts on the subject, as well as to afford <lb/>
a fair specimen of Mrs. Fawcett's style of oratory, we <lb/>
cannot do better than quote part of her reply, uttered <lb/>
at Bristol, in March, 1871, to those who at that time <lb/>
considered that if women had votes they would lose all <lb/>
refinement and delicacy, and in fact cease to be women <lb/>
in the truest sense.</p>
<p>"How can a reasonable being," she asked, "for one <lb/>
moment believe that any act which is not shameful and <lb/>
disgraceful in itself can deprive a woman of her <reg orig="woman-|liness">womanliness</reg>? <lb/>
Women have stood on the battlefield, with <lb/>
blood and carnage on every side of them and the air <lb/>
heavy with the groans of the dying. Have they been <lb/>
less true to womanhood and to humanity because they <lb/>
have cast aside the fear of danger to themselves and <lb/>
endured sickening sights and sounds for the sake of <lb/>
relieving the sufferings of others? Shakespeare makes <lb/>
many of his heroines do things which would be <reg orig="con-|sidered">considered</reg> <lb/>
very strange in these days. In one of his plays <lb/>
he speaks of a woman being unsexed. Who is it? <lb/>
Not Portia, who donned the doctor's robe and pleaded <lb/>
<pb n="129" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0300"/>
as an advocate in a court of law; not the quick-witted <lb/>
Beatrice, who longed to be a man to avenge the wrongs <lb/>
done to her cousin; not Helena, the physician. None <lb/>
of these, but Lady Macbeth, the perpetrator, for the <lb/>
sake of ambition, of the most revolting crimes. She <lb/>
was unsexed by actions which would transform anyone <lb/>
&mdash;man or woman&mdash;who committed them into a fiend. <lb/>
No act which is itself innocent can deprive a woman of <lb/>
her womanhood."</p>
<p>As to the effect of Mrs. Fawcett's speeches upon her <lb/>
hearers, a critic has said: "The first test of a speaker's <lb/>
success is popularity. &hellip; Judged by this criterion alone, <lb/>
Mrs. Fawcett's power is most remarkable; for whether <lb/>
she is announced to speak at an East End People's <lb/>
Palace or in a fashionable drawing-room, an overflowing <lb/>
audience is invariably gathered to hear her. &hellip; Her <lb/>
attitude to those who differ from her is marked by a <lb/>
spirit of conciliation, and her endeavour always is first <lb/>
to understand the difficulties which they feel, and then <lb/>
to meet and explain them. Her speeches afford not <lb/>
only a keen intellectual pleasure, but are pervaded by a <lb/>
fine literary sense and enlivened by abundant flashes of <lb/>
humour."</p>
<p>Concerning the progress made by the cause of <lb/>
Women's Suffrage during all these years of toil and <lb/>
struggle, Mrs. Fawcett has lately expressed herself as <lb/>
feeling great satisfaction. "The most important <reg orig="ad-|vance">advance</reg>," <lb/>
she remarked to an interviewer, "has been the <lb/>
second reading of the Suffrage Bill &lpar;in 1897&rpar;, and the <lb/>
most encouraging feature of the spread of Suffrage <lb/>
views amongst all classes of women was the response <lb/>
made to the canvass in 1894&ndash;5. More than a quarter <lb/>
of a million of women signed the Suffrage petition."</p>
<p>In addition to the works on political economy already <lb/>
<pb n="130" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0301"/>
mentioned and her one novel, <hi rend="italic">Janet Doncaster</hi>, Mrs. <lb/>
Fawcett has written a volume of female biography, <lb/>
entitled, <hi rend="italic">Some Eminent Women of our Time</hi>, and a <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Life of Queen Victoria</hi>, which was published in 1895. <lb/>
The article on Professor Henry Fawcett in the 1888 <lb/>
edition of <hi rend="italic">Chambers's Encyclop&aelig;dia</hi> is also from her pen.</p>
<p>To sum up our brief sketch of the life and work of <lb/>
Millicent Garrett Fawcett, we may say, in the words of <lb/>
an admiring but in no sense extravagantly partial <reg orig="re-|viewer">reviewer</reg>, <lb/>
that "whether as the author of the standard <reg orig="text-|book">textbook</reg> <lb/>
of political economy, whether pleading in sweet <lb/>
tones the cause of the weak and helpless, or whether <lb/>
labouring to promote the cause of female Suffrage, she <lb/>
stands distinguished alike for purity of motive, for logical <lb/>
common-sense and for gentle, womanly sympathy."</p>
<p>To which another adds a dictum in which most people <lb/>
will agree, that "to the advocates of women's <reg orig="enfran-|chisement">enfranchisement</reg> <lb/>
it has been an incalculable advantage to have <lb/>
the support of one upon whose ability, taste, and <reg orig="dis-|cretion">discretion</reg> <lb/>
they can at all times rely."</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">It</hi> has been said that children are the greatest <reg orig="dis-|covery">discovery</reg> <lb/>
of the nineteenth century, and it is certainly <lb/>
true that during the past fifty years people's eyes have <lb/>
been opened and their interest awakened to both the <lb/>
charm and the importance of childhood in a manner <lb/>
undreamed of when our grandparents were little ones. <lb/>
This is probably one reason why, while so much has <lb/>
been noticed and recorded respecting the infancy of <lb/>
most of our famous contemporaries, scarcely anything <lb/>
seems to be known of the juvenile days of those who <lb/>
were born early in the century.</p>
<p>Though there is a possibility of our being overdone <lb/>
with the bright sayings and clever doings of youngsters <lb/>
of the present generation, we feel that the interest of a <lb/>
biography is greatly enhanced by some account of the <lb/>
budding years of its subject, in which may perhaps be <lb/>
traced a forecast of gifted maturity, or at least a hint as <lb/>
to how a notable character commenced its development. <lb/>
We are, therefore, the more regretful that scarcely any <lb/>
record appears to be extant of the childhood of the <lb/>
heroine of our latest sketch.</p>
<pb n="132" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0303"/>
<p>Mrs. Gladstone, <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italic">n&eacute;e</hi></foreign> Catherine Glynne, was born on <lb/>
January 5th, 1812, and was the daughter of Sir Stephen <lb/>
Glynne, whose wife was the Hon. Mary Neville. She <lb/>
was named after her grandmother, the latter being sister <lb/>
to the first Marquis of Buckingham.</p>
<p>The little one first saw the light at Hawarden Castle, <lb/>
in Flintshire, where also, eighty-eight years later, her <lb/>
last breath expired.</p>
<p>The village of Hawarden is six miles from Chester, <lb/>
and, perched at a height of 250 feet from sea-level, <reg orig="over-|looks">overlooks</reg> <lb/>
a considerable portion of Cheshire and the estuary <lb/>
of the Dee. It boasts but a single winding street, about <lb/>
half a mile in length.</p>
<p>The old castle of Hawarden is a picturesque ruin. <lb/>
From the flower-garden of the new castle, which stands <lb/>
beneath its shadow, "a wide sweep of lawn, flanked by <lb/>
majestic oaks and beeches, carries the eye up to the <lb/>
foot-bridge crossing the moat, thence to the ivy-mantled <lb/>
walls which overhang it, and upward again to the <reg orig="flag-|topped">flag-topped</reg> <lb/>
tower which crowns the height. Clustering ivy <lb/>
and foliage here and there intervening serve to soften <lb/>
and beautify the mouldering remains. The scene brings <lb/>
to mind the words of the poet&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"'The old order changeth, giving place to new.'</l>
</lg></q>
All around us former scenes of rapine and violence are <lb/>
changed to fertility and peace. The old castle well <lb/>
serves to illustrate the contrast. Its hugely solid walls, <lb/>
reared six hundred years ago with so much pains and <lb/>
skill to repel invaders and overawe the lawless, are <lb/>
themselves abandoned to solitude and decay. Within <lb/>
arches which once echoed to the clang of arms the owls <lb/>
have their home, while rooks from the tree-tops around <lb/>
seem to chant the requiem of the past."</p>
<pb n="133" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0304"/>
<p>And, as the writer of the above might have added, <lb/>
the beautiful church, the orphanage, and the free library <lb/>
further emphasise the difference between the ideas of <lb/>
feudal times and those of the enlightened present.</p>
<p>This interesting relic of olden days was visited in <lb/>
1819 by the King of the Belgians, and one of the doors <lb/>
has ever since been called after him, in memory of the <lb/>
event. Some years later the Duchess of Kent and the <lb/>
young Princess Victoria were guests at Hawarden <lb/>
Castle, and the visitors' book contains their signatures <lb/>
in autograph. The little royal lady could scarcely then <lb/>
have dreamed that she and the other young girl, a few <lb/>
years her senior, who doubtless had the honour of <lb/>
presentation to the Princess on that occasion, would be <lb/>
ranked among the most famous good and noble women <lb/>
of the century and the very few who should live to see <lb/>
that century's close.</p>
<p>While still in the heyday of her youth and beauty <lb/>
Lady Glynne was left a widow, with an important <lb/>
estate to manage for her eight-year-old son, little Sir <lb/>
Stephen, and three other young children to bring up&mdash; <lb/>
Henry, who was afterwards for many years Rector of <lb/>
Hawarden, Catherine, then aged about three, and her <lb/>
tiny sister Mary. One of Mrs. Gladstone's earliest <lb/>
and most lasting recollections was the intense fear and <lb/>
horror with which she regarded the "mutes," then <reg orig="in-|dispensable">indispensable</reg> <lb/>
to grand funerals, who stood about the <lb/>
castle while her dead father lay in state.</p>
<p>Fortunately for Lady Glynne, her brother, shortly <lb/>
before this unhappy event, had been made Rector of <lb/>
Hawarden. The Hon. and Rev. George Neville <lb/>
Grenville was a man of considerable force of character, <lb/>
and assisted the bereaved lady greatly in her responsible <lb/>
task. Hawarden was in those days on the mail coach <lb/>
<pb n="134" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0305"/>
route from London to Holyhead, and had earned a <lb/>
somewhat undesirable reputation on the score of <reg orig="order-|liness">orderliness</reg> <lb/>
and sobriety. One of the first steps which <lb/>
Mr. Glynne took towards the reformation of the <lb/>
village was, with his sister's concurrence, to close the <lb/>
worst of the public-houses on the estate, leaving but <lb/>
two, the "Glynne Arms" and another.</p>
<p>He next began to consider the best means for <lb/>
educating the hitherto neglected villagers' children, <lb/>
and has been called the pioneer of popular elementary <lb/>
education in this remote corner of the country. A <lb/>
good deal of indifference, if not prejudice, had to be <lb/>
overcome at the outset. Parents required bribing to <lb/>
dispense with their children's services and the pence <lb/>
earned by them in field work, in order to let them <lb/>
spend their time in school. And in this work the <lb/>
rector found his sister and young nieces able and <lb/>
willing coadjutors. They prepared and gave gifts of <lb/>
warm and attractive clothing every Christmas to the <lb/>
boys and girls who had attended school regularly <lb/>
during the year.</p>
<p>Apparently, to get the youngsters inside the school <lb/>
walls was the great thing to be attained; what they <lb/>
learned, if anything, was of minor importance, for a <lb/>
visitor to Hawarden was lately talking to a very old <lb/>
inhabitant, who boasted that she was, as a child, the <lb/>
recipient of one of these coveted prizes many years in <lb/>
succession, and yet she had remained utterly illiterate.</p>
<p>"How was it, then, Mrs. C<gap desc="long dash" reason="missing" id="g1"/>," asked the visitor, <lb/>
"that you never learned to read or write?"</p>
<p>"Oh," replied the old dame unblushingly, "I never <lb/>
wanted to; I never tried. But I liked the pretty frock <lb/>
or warm cloak the Miss Glynnes always gave us for <lb/>
prizes at Christmas-time if we went to school regular." <lb/>

Adding, "Bless you! you should have seen the prizes <lb/>
in those days! They were worth looking at. None <lb/>
of your books and rubbish like what children get in <lb/>
these days."</p>
<p>The new castle of Hawarden, which, though <reg orig="brick-|built">brick-built</reg>, <lb/>
was cased in stone and castellated, that it might <lb/>
not seem incongruous beside the grand old ruin already <lb/>
described, stands in a lovely park of 250 acres in extent, <lb/>
which is well stocked with deer. "Its banks and <lb/>
glades," to borrow again from the picturesque writer <lb/>
quoted before, "richly timbered and overgrown with <lb/>
bracken, afford from various points beautiful views over <lb/>
the plain of Chester, with the bold projections of the <lb/>
Frodshams and Peckforton Hills." Thus amid scenes <lb/>
of great natural beauty, grand trees, grassy slopes, and <lb/>
romantic waterfalls, did little Catherine Glynne pass her <lb/>
earliest and most impressionable years.</p>
<p>The children of the Castle were simply and quietly <lb/>
brought up. Their mother devoted herself entirely to <lb/>
them, entering but little into society. There is no doubt <lb/>
that a benevolent care for her poorer neighbours and <lb/>
a love for philanthropic work generally was implanted <lb/>
in Mrs. Gladstone's heart from her childish days. As <lb/>
the Miss Glynnes grew up, regular visits were paid to <lb/>
the Metropolis, and occasional journeys taken to other <lb/>
parts of the country. During a winter sojourn at <lb/>
Hastings the young ladies and their mother stayed <lb/>
at a house next door to that occupied by the Princes <lb/>
George of Cambridge and George of Hanover with <lb/>
their tutor. An acquaintance was formed which "ripened <lb/>
into mutual regard," and we are told that "to the end <lb/>
of her life Mrs. Gladstone had no warmer friend and <lb/>
admirer than the Duke of Cambridge."</p>
<p>The sisters were by this time known as "the beautiful <lb/>
<pb n="137" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0308"/>
Miss Glynnes," and "the twin flowers of North Wales." <lb/>
The salubrious air of their native place, and the out-<reg orig="of-|door">of-door</reg> <lb/>
exercises of riding, rowing, walking, and archery, <lb/>
in which, rather than in studious pursuits, Catherine <lb/>
specially delighted, had enhanced their hereditary beauty <lb/>
with the bloom of health. A portrait of the charming <lb/>
pair which hangs on the walls of Hawarden Castle <lb/>
depicts them in falling ringlets, long sashes, and skirts <lb/>
full from the waist. The arm of the elder encircles <lb/>
the shoulders of the younger, and the features of our <lb/>
heroine are described as "regular; the nose, though <lb/>
well shaped, a little long; the mouth like a rosebud; <lb/>
the chin soft and round"; and even the engravings <lb/>
of this picture indicate that "the cheeks had not only <lb/>
the soft roundness, but the dazzling colour of the young <lb/>
English girl's complexion." The sisters had also a <lb/>
reputation for great pride of race&mdash;of which, however, <lb/>
they are said to have been wholly devoid&mdash;that served <lb/>
to discourage too self-confident suitors who might <reg orig="other-|wise">otherwise</reg> <lb/>
have been tempted by their beauty and wealth.</p>
<p>It was about the year 1834 that Miss Catherine <lb/>
Glynne, at a West End dinner party, met a young <lb/>
Oxford friend of her brother, named William Gladstone. <lb/>
This individual was gifted with a remarkably handsome <lb/>
person, and a voice, in speaking or singing, equally <lb/>
beautiful. He had in his Eton days been the life and <lb/>
soul of the <hi rend="italic">Eton Miscellany</hi>, which the edited, and now <lb/>
already for two years had represented Newark in the <lb/>
House of Commons. It was either on this occasion, or <lb/>
on one of the many subsequent dinner or musical <lb/>
parties in London at which the two young people were <lb/>
fellow-guests, that a mutual friend bade Miss Glynne <lb/>
"mark that young man," adding, "he will one day be <lb/>
Prime Minister of England."</p>
<pb n="138" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0309"/>
<p>In 1835 Sir Stephen Glynne invited his old chum to <lb/>
Hawarden, but notwithstanding a reciprocity of <reg orig="admira-|tion">admiration</reg> <lb/>
between the pair who were destined to subsequently <lb/>
spend a long and happy life together, either the modesty <lb/>
of the gentleman or the coyness of the lady prevented <lb/>
any understanding coming to pass at that time between <lb/>
them.</p>
<p>They parted, and three years passed away. This <lb/>
period was partly occupied by Mr. Gladstone in writing <lb/>
his first book, <hi rend="italic">The State in its Relations with the <lb/>
Church;</hi> and on its completion his eyesight was found <lb/>
to be so much overstrained by the continuous <reg orig="applica-|tion">application</reg> <lb/>
that an oculist prescribed a winter in Italy, with <lb/>
complete rest. And Mr. Gladstone, for the close of 1838 <lb/>
and beginning of 1839, repaired to Rome.</p>
<p>We can imagine how his eager spirit, bounding with <lb/>
the energy of youth and voracious for study, must have <lb/>
chafed against this enforced idleness, and indeed, a <lb/>
failure of the most precious sense thus early in a <lb/>
promising career was a seemingly sad augury. Yet <lb/>
this dark cloud was lined with even more than silver, <lb/>
for its sunny side was glorified with the brightest gold <lb/>
of joy.</p>
<p>Lady Glynne, with her son Sir Stephen and her <lb/>
lovely daughters, still unmarried, were also wintering <lb/>
in Rome, and once more Catherine and Mr. Gladstone <lb/>
were thrown into each other's society. The publication <lb/>
of the above-named book by the latter, which had met <lb/>
with very favourable criticisms from the most capable <lb/>
reviewers, had greatly enhanced his political and social <lb/>
prestige, and he waxed bold to pay Miss Glynne <lb/>
open and unmistakable attention. Soon followed the <lb/>
announcement that they were engaged.</p>
<p>It is said that the actual proposal took place one <lb/>
<pb n="139" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0310"/>
night when the young couple joined in a torchlight <lb/>
visit to the Coliseum, and that the lover led up to his <lb/>
crucial declaration by an apt quotation from Lord <lb/>
Byron's <hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi>, commencing <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"Upon such a night I stood within the Coliseum's wall,</l>
<l rend="indent">'Midst the chief relics of almighty Rome."</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>However that may be, Mrs. Gladstone was wont to <lb/>
confess that it was the extraordinary beauty, eloquence, <lb/>
and poetry of Mr. Gladstone's conversation on that <lb/>
memorable evening which finally won her heart.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, another love affair had been satisfactorily <lb/>
progressing between the younger Miss Glynne and Lord <lb/>
Lyttelton, so that both Catherine and Mary were <reg orig="be-|trothed">betrothed</reg> <lb/>
about the same time; and the double wedding <lb/>
took place at Hawarden Church on July 25th, 1839, the <lb/>
officiating clergyman being uncle of the sister-brides, <lb/>
the Hon. and Rev. George Neville Grenville, Rector of <lb/>
Hawarden.</p>
<p>To those who are amused by the style and diction of <lb/>
newspaper reporters of more than half a century ago, <lb/>
the following extract from <hi rend="italic">The Chester Chronicle</hi> of <lb/>
July 26th, 1839, may not be uninteresting:&mdash;</p>
<p>"The procession slowly proceeded through the town, <lb/>
every window being filled with elegantly attired females, <lb/>
all sporting bridal favours, and the happy principals of <lb/>
the day's festivities were greeted with loud cheers and <lb/>
the waving of handkerchiefs. On arriving at the avenue <lb/>
leading to the parish church the good feeling of the <lb/>
inhabitants had induced them to cover the carriage road <lb/>
with rich carpeting, and school children were ranged on <lb/>
each side. The footsteps of the brides expectant were <lb/>
strewn with flowers by beautiful children. The parish <lb/>
church was crammed with females to suffocation. The <lb/>
<pb n="140" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0311"/>
service was read in a most imposing manner by the <lb/>
Hon. and Rev. Neville Grenville, and at the close of <lb/>
the ceremony the brace of happy couples were warmly <lb/>
greeted by their friends and connections. The <reg orig="brides-|maids">bridesmaids</reg> <lb/>
on this happy occasion were Miss Wynne, the <lb/>
Hon. Miss Lawley, Miss Gladstone, and the three Miss <lb/>
Nevilles.</p>
<p>"Immediately after the ceremony, Lord and Lady <lb/>
Lyttelton set off in their travelling carriage to spend <lb/>
the honeymoon at his lordship's splendid mansion, <lb/>
Hagley, near Stourbridge, Worcestershire, and Mr. and <lb/>
Mrs. Gladstone to Norton Priory, the hospitable seat of <lb/>
Sir Richard Brooke, Bart."</p>
<p>It is related that one of the villagers of Hawarden, <lb/>
seeing the two bridegrooms together for the first time <lb/>
without knowing one from the other, was so much <lb/>
struck by the "aristocratic pallor" of Mr. Gladstone's <lb/>
face that he exclaimed, "Well, there's no mistaking <lb/>
which is the lord!"</p>
<p>Sir Francis Doyle, one of the most famous of Mr. <lb/>
Gladstone's gifted contemporaries at Eton, officiated as <lb/>
best man, and celebrated the occasion in a poem, <lb/>
entitled "The Sister-Brides." The lines devoted to <lb/>
Mrs. Gladstone were as follows:&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="stanza">
<l>"High hopes are thine, O eldest flower!</l>

</lg>

<div2 type="chapter" n="II" id="d62">
<head><hi rend="bold">CHAPTER II. <lb/>
"TWO CHERRIES UPON ONE STALK."</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> phrase with which we have headed this chapter <lb/>
was the appellation bestowed by Bishop <reg orig="Wilber-|force">Wilberforce</reg> <lb/>
upon young Mr. and Mrs. Gladstone before they <lb/>
had been married three months, so impressed was he by <lb/>
the ready assimilation of the bride's mind and character <lb/>
to the stronger nature of her husband.</p>
<p>It is said that at the outset of their wedded life Mr. <lb/>
Gladstone, "forecasting his probable career," gave his <lb/>
wife her choice between two alternatives: she might be <lb/>
content to know nothing of his political plans and <lb/>
secrets, and be free from responsibility, or she might <lb/>
know everything on condition of being pledged to <reg orig="in-|violable">inviolable</reg> <lb/>
secrecy. She chose, as most wives would, the <lb/>
latter alternative, and throughout the sixty years that <lb/>
she enjoyed the complete confidence of her statesman <lb/>
husband she behaved with an amount of discretion and <lb/>
self-control that won from him the testimony that "my <lb/>
wife has known every political secret I ever had, and <lb/>
has never betrayed my confidence."</p>
<p>On one occasion, indeed, soon after their marriage, <lb/>
Mrs. Gladstone <hi rend="italic">almost</hi> let slip a hint as to some <reg orig="im-|portant">important</reg> <lb/>
fact of which she was in possession, but checking <lb/>
<pb n="142" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0313"/>
herself in time, she hurried from the room and at once <lb/>
penned a note of apology to her husband, which she <lb/>
sent in by a servant. Almost immediately the young <lb/>
wife's perturbed mind was relieved by an answer in <lb/>
some such words as these: "Dearest C.,&mdash;Don't blame <lb/>
yourself. I don't blame you. It is the only little <lb/>
mistake you ever made.&mdash;Your affectionate W. E. G."</p>
<p>In later years Mrs. Gladstone acquired a knack of <lb/>
parrying without offence the ventures of the <reg orig="inquisi-|tive">inquisitive</reg>, <lb/>
which was a source of amusement and <reg orig="admira-|tion">admiration</reg> <lb/>
to her friends. To the common question, "What <lb/>
is Mr. Gladstone going to do about&mdash;this, or that?" she <lb/>
would reply, with a smile of childlike innocence, "Well, <lb/>
I wonder, don't you? What do you think he ought <lb/>
to do?"</p>
<p>It was during the first winter after their marriage that <lb/>
an accident occurred which might have robbed the <lb/>
happy bride of her husband and altered the destinies <lb/>
of the world. Mr. and Mrs. Gladstone were staying at <lb/>
Hawarden Castle, which had not yet become their home, <lb/>
and the former had gone out shooting with his <reg orig="brother-|in-law">brother-in-law</reg>, <lb/>
the Rev. Henry Glynne.</p>
<p>It was some hours before they returned, and Mrs. <lb/>
Gladstone was at the window watching for them when <lb/>
they approached the house. With a thrill of horror she <lb/>
noticed that her husband's left arm was carried in a <lb/>
sling, while the ashen pallor of her brother's face told <lb/>
that something serious had occurred. The fact was <lb/>
that Mr. Gladstone, having set down his gun among <lb/>
some brambles, a trail had somehow caught the trigger <lb/>
and discharged the loaded barrel into his left hand, the <lb/>
first finger of which was completely blown away. He <lb/>
ever afterwards wore a black finger-stall to conceal the <lb/>
disfigured stump.</p>
<pb n="143" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0314"/>
<p>This calls to mind a somewhat similar, though less <lb/>
alarming, disaster that happened to Mrs. Gladstone <lb/>
herself many years later, which serves to illustrate the <lb/>
self-effacing devotion to her husband and his interests <lb/>
which was the keynote of her whole life.</p>
<p>Driving with him one evening to the House of <lb/>
Commons, Mrs. Gladstone had the misfortune to get <lb/>
one of her fingers smashed in the carriage door, and <lb/>
twisting the injured member into her handkerchief, she <lb/>
bore the pain in heroic silence rather than disturb the <lb/>
current of his thoughts by the knowledge of her <lb/>
accident and risk spoiling by possible uneasiness on <lb/>
her behalf the power of his intended speech.</p>
<p>In care for her husband's health Mrs. Gladstone <lb/>
seems to have combined the solicitude of a mother <lb/>
and a doctor with that of a wife. Like many another <lb/>
who has lived to an advanced age, the great statesman's <lb/>
youth scarcely gave promise of the robustness of his <lb/>
later life, and her skill and judgment won from him the <lb/>
testimony that "my wife is no inconsiderable physician." <lb/>
Most people who saw and heard Mr. Gladstone speak <lb/>
were familiar with the yellowish mixture in a bottle&mdash; <lb/>
irreverently nicknamed "the pomatum-<reg orig='pot"&mdash;where-|with'>pot"&mdash;wherewith</reg> <lb/>
he was wont to sustain his vocal strength during <lb/>
any special effort. This cordial, compounded of egg <lb/>
and other ingredients, was prepared by Mrs. Gladstone's <lb/>
own hands, and she often, upon a public platform, <lb/>
would hand it to him herself. In the home she <reg orig="con-|stantly">constantly</reg> <lb/>
acted as a buffer between her husband's sensitive, <lb/>
highly strung temperament and the commoner worries <lb/>
of life, shielding him from everything that might arouse <lb/>
"the vulnerable temper and impetuous moods" which <lb/>
were a characteristic of him in his prime. In his <reg orig="speech-|making">speech-making</reg> <lb/>
tours she accompanied him, attending with <lb/>
<pb n="144" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0315"/>
nurselike vigilance to his every want; in visits to <lb/>
friends' houses her tender watchfulness and even gentle <lb/>
tyranny sometimes gave rise to some amusement among <lb/>
those who witnessed it, while her loving persistence in <lb/>
accompanying her idolised husband, no matter what the <lb/>
weather, in his walks and drives greatly tended to <lb/>
strengthen her own constitution and fortify her health. <lb/>
There were even those who said that as years went on <lb/>
Mrs. Gladstone grew to resemble in feature the dear <lb/>
one whom she so adored, until her face "became the <lb/>
mild counterpart of her great husband's, with all the <lb/>
womanly sweetness that replaced his expression of <lb/>
aquiline energy and stern decision." At the House <lb/>
of Commons Mrs. Gladstone was a constant attendant, <lb/>
sitting for hours in the Ladies' Gallery listening to his <lb/>
longest speeches with rapt admiration and delight.</p>
<p>Theirs was indeed an ideal union, a perfect home. <lb/>
The Countess of Aberdeen, an intimate and devoted <lb/>
friend of both Mr. and Mrs. Gladstone, has said that <lb/>
"as you crossed that threshold you felt that you came <lb/>
into no ordinary atmosphere. &hellip; It has all been so <lb/>
often described. Mr. Gladstone's morning walk, by the <lb/>
woodland path he had made, to the daily eight o'clock <lb/>
service at the parish church; Mrs. Gladstone gathering <lb/>
her household together for family prayers; the rich and <lb/>
varied conversation at meal times, or during walks and <lb/>
drives; the instant and regular resumption of work <lb/>
at the appointed hours; the consideration shown to <lb/>
every member of the household, each of whom seemed <lb/>
to be an object of solicitous interest; the wide <reg orig="sym-|pathies">sympathies</reg> <lb/>
flowing out from that home to all who were <lb/>
in trouble and sorrow, whether the sufferers dwelt in <lb/>
palaces or in lowly cottages; the orphanage at the Castle <lb/>
gates; and the innumerable agencies for good in which <lb/>
<pb n="145" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0316"/>
a personal share was taken by the family; the sense <lb/>
of duty first and pleasure afterwards which pervaded all <lb/>
the daily routine; the personal devotion to the Queen <lb/>
and her service, shown whenever her name was <reg orig="men-|tioned">mentioned</reg>. <lb/>
These are but a few of the memories which <lb/>
are left with us of surroundings which must have been <lb/>
lived amongst to be understood."</p>
<p>It was, we should have observed, only a few years <lb/>
after the marriage of Mr. and Mrs. Gladstone that the <lb/>
birthplace of the latter became their permanent home.</p>
<p>Sir Stephen Glynne, being still a bachelor, was, owing <lb/>
to serious financial losses, glad for his sister and her <lb/>
husband to share Hawarden Castle with him and bear <lb/>
part of the expense of maintaining it. He remained <lb/>
the head of the house, while Mrs. Gladstone assumed <lb/>
the position of its mistress, and Mr. Gladstone himself <lb/>
"held something like the place of an honoured guest, <lb/>
an admirable arrangement which relieved him from <reg orig="re-|sponsibility">responsibility</reg>, <lb/>
and left him free for his own pursuits.</p>
<p>Eight children in all were born to Mr. and Mrs. <lb/>
Gladstone. The eldest, William Henry, in June, 1840, <lb/>
and the youngest, Herbert, in 1854. One daughter, <lb/>
Catherine, died in childhood; another married the Rev. <lb/>
Edward Wickham, now Dean of Lincoln; another, <lb/>
wife of the Rev. Harry Drew, is the mother of Mr. <lb/>
Gladstone's pet grandchild, Dorothy.</p>
<p>The only unmarried daughter, Miss Helen Gladstone, <lb/>
became Vice-Principal of Newnham College; while the <lb/>
remaining two sons are Mr. Stephen and Mr. Henry <lb/>
Gladstone. The eldest son died in recent years, but <lb/>
with the exception of this bereavement and that of the <lb/>
little girl above-mentioned, the family circle was <reg orig="un-|broken">unbroken</reg>.</p>
<p>When Sir Stephen Glynne died, in 1874, Hawarden <lb/>
<pb n="146" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0317"/>
Castle estate passed, according to his will, to his sister's <lb/>
eldest son, but the Castle was to remain the home of <lb/>
Mr. and Mrs. Gladstone to the close of their lives.</p>
<p>Mr. Gladstone fully appreciated the value of his wife's <lb/>
loving devotion and the preciousness of that ideal <reg orig="home-|life">home-life</reg> <lb/>
which, as he himself testified, was "a source of <lb/>
unclouded and unvarying consolation, without a break, <lb/>
without a shadow, without a change." When, nine <lb/>
years after the celebration of their golden wedding, the <lb/>
Grand Old Man was called to his rest, she&mdash;of whom <lb/>
he half a century before had said, "If anything happens <lb/>
to Catherine, I should close the volume and close it <lb/>
for ever"&mdash;she, tender and true to the last, was at his <lb/>
side, and with her hand in his and the words "<reg orig="Kind-|ness">Kindness</reg>! <lb/>
nothing but kindness!" on his lips, he peacefully <lb/>
passed away.</p>

<head><hi rend="bold">CHAPTER III. <lb/>
AN IDEAL WOMAN.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">No</hi> one, it has been said, would have called Mrs. <lb/>
Gladstone an intellectual woman; some even, <lb/>
deceived by the at times almost childlike simplicity of <lb/>
her manner and the worshipful admiration with which <lb/>
she looked up to her gifted husband, might have fancied <lb/>
her rather the reverse, but this would have been a great <lb/>
mistake.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, though Mrs. Gladstone was essentially <lb/>
a womanly rather than a bookish woman, and it was <lb/>
as wife, mother, nurse, and sympathetic friend of the <lb/>
poor and suffering that she especially shone, it is <reg orig="pos-|sible">possible</reg>, <lb/>
had she belonged to a later generation, that among <lb/>
the recent developments of her sex that of the lady <lb/>
<pb n="147" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0318"/>
doctor might have exercised a fascination over her, <lb/>
as she really possessed some practical knowledge of <lb/>
medicine, and had even dared to differ from her <lb/>
husband on the subject of vaccination. It may not <lb/>
be generally known, too, that as recently as four years <lb/>
before her death, at the earnest solicitation of an <reg orig="enter-|prising">enterprising</reg> <lb/>
American editor, she wrote an article on the <lb/>
bringing up of children for the <hi rend="italic">Philadelphia Ladies' <lb/>
Home Journal</hi>, and is said to have received for this <lb/>
contribution the highest rate of remuneration ever paid <lb/>
for an article on a purely domestic subject by the editor <lb/>
of a ladies' paper.</p>
<p>Mrs. Gladstone was also the author of one of the <lb/>
official handbooks published by William Clowes and <lb/>
Son, at the time when the International Health <reg orig="Ex-|hibition">Exhibition</reg> <lb/>
was being held in London; it was entitled <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Healthy Nurseries and Bedrooms</hi>, a pamphlet of fifty <lb/>
pages in length. This book has been described as <lb/>
"well arranged, and singularly clear in its phraseology. <lb/>
Every sentence and every quotation seem to point to <lb/>
an author who had not only practical experience in the <lb/>
tending of her own children or grandchildren, but who <lb/>
had also a keen sympathy for the children of less <lb/>
fortunately situated parents."</p>
<p>Mrs. Gladstone was, moreover, an indefatigable writer <lb/>
of letters, and during her long life she had numbered <lb/>
among her correspondence "letters of the highest <reg orig="in-|terest">interest</reg> <lb/>
from the most famous personages, royal, political, <lb/>
and ecclesiastical, of the present reign." She was <reg orig="con-|stant">constant</reg> <lb/>
in writing to her children when away from home, <lb/>
and her son-in-law, the Rev. Harry Drew, has uttered <lb/>
his belief that when the full story of Mrs. Gladstone's <lb/>
life is made public and her "wonderful letters" see the <lb/>
light of day, the world at large will realise that in her <lb/>
<pb n="148" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0319"/>
we have lost from our midst one of the greatest and <lb/>
most remarkable women of this century.</p>
<p>But the love and tenderness lavished upon our <lb/>
heroine's husband and innermost home circle was not <lb/>
confined to them; her abounding kindness of heart <lb/>
flowed out to all with whom she came in contact. A <lb/>
few instances of this sweet geniality of disposition will <lb/>
suffice as illustrations, before we pass on to speak of <lb/>
Mrs. Gladstone's greater and more public acts of charity.</p>
<p>A clergyman records the following in the <hi rend="italic">Daily <lb/>
News:&mdash;</hi></p>
<p>"I was due to preach at Hawarden Church on the <lb/>
evening of a week-day festival. It was before there <lb/>
was a station in the village, and train connection was <lb/>
missed at Chester. A wire informed the rector that the <lb/>
next fast train would be stopped at the nearest station, <lb/>
and that the preacher, though late, would be in time for <lb/>
the sermon. Driving up to the church, I was about to <lb/>
enter, but was met by old Mrs. Gladstone, who was <lb/>
waiting about to take me into the rectory, insisting that <lb/>
I must first have a basin of soup, which she brought me <lb/>
with her own hands."</p>
<p>A journalist also tells a story showing that Mrs. <lb/>
Gladstone was not only willing to take trouble in order <lb/>
to give pleasure to an insignificant stranger, but would <lb/>
charge her memory with a promise to that effect until <lb/>
able to carry it out.</p>
<p>"Attending a meeting in Latimer Hall, Bridge Street, <lb/>
Mile End &lpar;on the occasion of the General Election in <lb/>
1886&rpar;, to support the Liberal candidate, Mr. Arnold <lb/>
White, Mrs. Gladstone read a message from her husband. <lb/>
A reporter borrowed the document to copy it, and with <lb/>
the audacity of some of his tribe asked Mrs. Gladstone <lb/>
whether the writing was her own, his intention being to <lb/>
<pb n="149" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0320"/>
ask that he might keep it if the answer were in the <lb/>
affirmative. She replied that it was, whereupon a <lb/>
gentleman sitting beside her forestalled the petition, <lb/>
and secured the document. Mrs. Gladstone, seeing the <lb/>
reporter's disappointment and guessing what was in his <lb/>
mind, said, with a sweet smile, 'Never mind. I will <lb/>
send you the same thing.' The message covered both <lb/>
sides of a sheet of notepaper, but two days later another <lb/>
copy of it, in Mrs. Gladstone's writing, reached the <lb/>
reporter from Downing Street."</p>
<p>Many stories have been told of Mrs. Gladstone's <lb/>
amusing liability to small social blunders, but they are all <lb/>
good-humoured stories, and those who knew her well <lb/>
say that she never in her life said or did anything which <lb/>
gave unmerited pain. Mr. Gladstone once remarked to <lb/>
a friend, with evident pride, "My wife has a marvellous <lb/>
faculty for getting into scrapes, but an even more <reg orig="mar-|vellous">marvellous</reg> <lb/>
faculty for getting out of them."</p>
<p>It is said that in the smaller matters of daily life she <lb/>
was untidy and unmethodical, and spent but little time <lb/>
or care over her dress, which was rarely as costly or <lb/>
fashionable as some ladies in her position would have <lb/>
deemed essential. It is related that on one occasion a <lb/>
whole house was turned inside out to find the bodice <lb/>
belonging to a certain dress, and that the missing article <lb/>
was ultimately discovered slipped by accident <reg orig="under-|neath">underneath</reg> <lb/>
the skirt! It sometimes happened that in her <lb/>
anxiety to hear a speech of her husband's in the House <lb/>
of Commons, and also to be ready in time to accompany <lb/>
him out to dinner afterwards, she would perform her <lb/>
evening toilette in the little dressing-room behind the <lb/>
Ladies' Gallery, doing this "with a frankness and <reg orig="sim-|plicity">simplicity</reg> <lb/>
which made all women at once laugh a little at <lb/>
her and love her a great deal."</p>
<pb n="150" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0321"/>
<p>Mrs. Gladstone's sweet smile and sunny disposition <lb/>
were remarked by all who knew her, as were also her <lb/>
natural shrewdness and quaint humour. She won the <lb/>
cordial esteem and affection of many who were her <lb/>
husband's political opponents. On her part she <reg orig="re-|garded">regarded</reg> <lb/>
them with no rancour or personal resentment. <lb/>
Of course, they were in the wrong; they must be if they <lb/>
differed from <hi rend="italic">him;</hi> but, poor things! such blindness was <lb/>
their misfortune rather than their fault. In this respect <lb/>
she set a noble example to the many who, in the realm <lb/>
of religion as well as politics, are too prone to credit <lb/>
everyone who is unable to see eye to eye as they do <lb/>
with pig-headedness, prejudice, and even viler reasons <lb/>
for opposing what they themselves believe to be the <lb/>
only truth.</p>
<p>It was during Mrs. Gladstone's quite early married <lb/>
days that she was actively associated with the House of <lb/>
Charity for Distressed Persons, established in Soho. <lb/>
The primary object of this institution, to use Mr. <lb/>
Gladstone's own words, was "the care of the <reg orig="convales-|cent">convalescent</reg> <lb/>
and finding employment for them; but its efforts <lb/>
were never confined within these limits, and out of it <lb/>
were developed in course of time the Newport Market <lb/>
Refuge and Newport Market School."</p>
<p>While the House of Charity was designed to assist <lb/>
unfortunate persons a little higher in the social scale <lb/>
than the working classes, the Newport Market Refuge <lb/>
was started by Mr. and Mrs. Gladstone to aid the very <lb/>
poor. The idea originated, it is said, with Mr. Gladstone, <lb/>
whose heart was often touched by the sight of friendless <lb/>
wanderers as he went late at night or in the small <lb/>
hours of the morning from the House of Commons <lb/>
to his own home. Begun in 1863, this refuge in the <lb/>
course of a single year has given as many as 13,000 <lb/>
<pb n="151" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0322"/>
night's lodgings and 30,000 free meals, while <reg orig="employ-|ment">employment</reg> <lb/>
or a return to their home and friends was secured <lb/>
for over 300 persons of both sexes. Originally <lb/>
established in some disused slaughter-houses at the <lb/>
back of Leicester Square, it is said to have been "the <lb/>
prototype of the Salvation Army doss-house and the <lb/>
parent of the Rowton Homes." In aid of this work <lb/>
Mrs. Gladstone collected among her friends the sum <lb/>
of &pound;1,200.</p>
<p>Later on a Boys' Industrial School was added to the <lb/>
Refuge, and the combined work continued to enjoy <lb/>
Mrs. Gladstone's sympathy and practical aid to the <lb/>
last days of her life. As recently as 1897 she told the <lb/>
Committee that though the charity was "very near <lb/>
her heart," yet "at her great age and Mr. Gladstone's" <lb/>
it was impossible for them to continue their public <lb/>
efforts on its behalf. We are assured, however, by <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">The Times</hi> that "a work of great practical value is <lb/>
still carried on by the institution, which is well deserving <lb/>
of practical sympathy and support. One of the most <lb/>
interesting phases of this work, perhaps, is the 'rescue' <lb/>
and conversion into army bandsmen of poor boys who <lb/>
might otherwise go to the bad."</p>
<p>It was during the terrible cholera epidemic of 1866 <lb/>
that Mrs. Gladstone became the pioneer of the free <lb/>
convalescent home movement. As the disease raged <lb/>
principally at the East End a great number of the <lb/>
sufferers were admitted to the London Hospital, where <lb/>
special wards were set apart to accommodate them. <lb/>
Mrs. Gladstone had already been in the habit of <lb/>
visiting the patients in this hospital, and did not <lb/>
allow fear of infection or natural shrinking from the <lb/>
sight of such distressing suffering to deter her from <lb/>
continuing her ministrations. She was seen at the <lb/>
<pb n="152" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0323"/>
hospital almost daily during that awful time, and was <lb/>
"known to enter an enormous ward full of dead and <lb/>
dying men, with screens drawn round many of the beds, <lb/>
indicating that each of them held a corpse which had <lb/>
not yet been removed, and with her own hands to <lb/>
assist the nurses in rubbing the feet of patients in <lb/>
whom the lamp of life burnt low."</p>
<p>The Secretary of the London Hospital, speaking of <lb/>
Mrs. Gladstone's help at this period, says, "Ah, she was <lb/>
a good woman, a brave woman! She faced all the <lb/>
difficulties at a time when people outside seemed to <lb/>
be panic-stricken. &hellip; Her sympathy, her flowers, <lb/>
her very presence in the wards, were, in that terrible <lb/>
crisis, a blessing such as you can scarcely realise <lb/>
now."</p>
<p>The great need soon became apparent for a <reg orig="con-|valescent">convalescent</reg> <lb/>
home in which patients could be promptly <lb/>
received without the many restrictions surrounding <lb/>
admittance into most existing institutions of the kind. <lb/>
This led Mrs. Gladstone to establish a convalescent <lb/>
home of her own at Snaresbrook, a healthy locality <lb/>
near Epping Forest, and not difficult of access from the <lb/>
East End of London. Later on the work was <reg orig="trans-|ferred">transferred</reg> <lb/>
to Woodford Hall, Essex, also close to the <lb/>
Forest, and beautifully surrounded by lawns, trees, and <lb/>
flowers.</p>
<p>When in town Mrs. Gladstone, for nearly twenty-five <lb/>
years, attended regularly every Monday morning at the <lb/>
London Hospital to personally inquire into the needs <lb/>
and circumstances of those patients who had applied <lb/>
for admission to Woodford Hall. Clergymen and <lb/>
ministers of all denominations were allowed to send <lb/>
their sick poor to her with a letter of recommendation; <lb/>
but when accommodation was limited, preference was <lb/>
<pb n="153" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0324"/>
always given to patients from the London Hospital. <lb/>
Every year more than 1,000 men, women, and children <lb/>
enjoyed the benefits of a week or two at this delightful <lb/>
spot, spending most of their time out of doors in the <lb/>
sweet woodland air, while their restoration to health <lb/>
was also hastened by the nourishing food and kind care <lb/>
they received while at Woodford Hall. In 1899, <reg orig="how-|ever">however</reg>, <lb/>
owing to the increasing population of the <reg orig="neigh-|bourhood">neighbourhood</reg>, <lb/>
it was deemed advisable to seek a suitable <lb/>
site for the home further out in the country.</p>
<p>Miss Simmons, the lady-superintendent of the <reg orig="Con-|valescent">Convalescent</reg> <lb/>
Home, thus describes the pleasure which a <lb/>
visit from the beloved foundress would give the <reg orig="in-|mates:&mdash;">inmates:&mdash;</reg></p>
<p>"She would make kindly inquiries about them, and <lb/>
address to them some cheering words, while above all <lb/>
she never failed to sit down at the piano &lpar;presented by <lb/>
Lord Cowper&rpar; in the women's living-room &lpar;used for <lb/>
concerts in the winter&rpar; and play for them, so that they <lb/>
could have a dance, country dances and Sir Roger de <lb/>
Coverley being the established favourites."</p>
<p>It was the cholera epidemic, too, which was the <lb/>
means of setting on foot Mrs. Gladstone's Orphan <lb/>
Homes. Many poor fathers and mothers died in the <lb/>
hospital, leaving their children destitute and literally <lb/>
naked, for their clothing had all to be burned. Mrs. <lb/>
Gladstone found cloaks and blankets to wrap these <lb/>
little ones in, and took them with her to lodgings she <lb/>
had provided for them, or in some cases even to her <lb/>
own home. Then she begged fresh clothing of her <lb/>
friends, rented an empty house at Clapton, and wrote a <lb/>
letter of appeal to <hi rend="italic">The Times</hi>, which resulted in <reg orig="dona-|tions">donations</reg> <lb/>
to the extent of &pound;5,000. One who went with her <lb/>
to visit the cholera orphans at Clapton will never forget <lb/>
<pb n="154" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0325"/>
the sight: "As soon as the door was opened Mrs. <lb/>
Gladstone was surrounded by little ones, who clung to <lb/>
her and almost overwhelmed her in their eagerness to <lb/>
obtain a caress."</p>
<p>The orphanage at Hawarden was the outcome, <reg orig="in-|directly">indirectly</reg>, <lb/>
of the Lancashire cotton famine, consequent <lb/>
upon the American War that raged during the early <lb/>
sixties. Touched by the sad destitution of many young <lb/>
girls who had formerly been employed in the cotton <lb/>
mills, and assisted by her brother, Sir Stephen Glynne, <lb/>
who offered the use of a nice old house that had once <lb/>
been the dower house of the family, Mrs. Gladstone <lb/>
started a training home for them, under the care of a <lb/>
suitable person, who had for some years been nurse to <lb/>
her own children and had lately married. Here the <lb/>
girls were kept and prepared for domestic service, and, <lb/>
when fit, Mrs. Gladstone found situations for them <lb/>
among her friends, thus making room in the home <lb/>
for more.</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1867 Mrs. Gladstone brought down <lb/>
to Hawarden about a dozen of her little orphans from <lb/>
Clapton, and lodged them under the care of a <reg orig="respect-|able">respectable</reg> <lb/>
widow in another small house which her brother <lb/>
had lent her. When the famine trouble was quite <lb/>
over and the dower house was no longer needed for <lb/>
distressed mill-girls, she transferred all the Clapton <lb/>
orphans there, adding to them from time to time the <lb/>
destitute children of other poor patients who died in <lb/>
the London Hospital. The larger house accommodates <lb/>
about thirty children, and has for some time been <reg orig="de-|voted">devoted</reg> <lb/>
to boys only, as there appears to be much greater <lb/>
difficulty in providing for them than for girls. These <lb/>
attend the parish school until old enough to be <lb/>
apprenticed to a trade; and there is now a whole <lb/>
<pb n="155" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0326"/>
army of promising young men doing well in the world <lb/>
who owe their present position to their bringing up at <lb/>
Hawarden Orphanage.</p>
<p>About the year 1880, a Home for training young <lb/>
women for domestic service was opened at Notting Hill. <lb/>
The object of this Home was to take under its <reg orig="pro-|tection">protection</reg> <lb/>
young girls who had bad homes, and were likely <lb/>
in consequence to drift into a life of uselessness or vice. <lb/>
It was under the direction of a committee of ladies, and <lb/>
Mrs. Gladstone consented to become its President. Not <lb/>
more than fifteen girls are kept here at a time, and as <lb/>
a few lady boarders are also taken in, the inmates are <lb/>
well and carefully trained for various positions in <lb/>
domestic service. "The proud characteristic of this <lb/>
school is its determination never to despair of any <lb/>
pupil, however discouraging she may be in her first <lb/>
trial of service." Chances of reformation are offered <lb/>
the girls again and again, and many have come to be <lb/>
deeply thankful for the patience and forbearance which <lb/>
they have here received.</p>
<p>Every year the girls from this Home who are in <lb/>
service are treated to a day's outing to Woodford Hall. <lb/>
A few summers ago, when they had luncheon and tea <lb/>
under the shadow of a rare kind of sycamore which <lb/>
Mrs. Gladstone had long ago brought from Hawarden <lb/>
as a seedling in a flower-pot, their kind friend told them <lb/>
that she had "never thought to live so long as to see <lb/>
that little tree large enough to shelter a party of forty <lb/>
people under the shadow of its foliage"&mdash;fit emblem of <lb/>
the growth of many a good work, which from a small <lb/>
beginning has developed into a means of wide and <reg orig="far-|reaching">far-reaching</reg> <lb/>
beneficence.</p>

<head><hi rend="bold">CHAPTER IV. <lb/>
A PEACEFUL EVENTIDE.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">For</hi> far beyond the limit of years assigned by the <lb/>
Psalmist was Mrs. Gladstone permitted to retain <lb/>
the health and activity of her prime, as well as the <lb/>
almost youthful grace of her figure and carriage, and <lb/>
no small trace of the beauty of her early days.</p>
<p>On the return of Mr. Gladstone and his wife from <lb/>
a visit to Naples, when she was past seventy-five, the <lb/>
former remarked that Mrs. Gladstone had walked up a <lb/>
steep flight of steps at Posilippo, "which," he added, "she <lb/>
could not have touched in her youth." It is said that <lb/>
no married couple in London so frequently returned on <lb/>
foot after dining out as Mr. and Mrs. Gladstone; and <lb/>
although the latter was not able to keep up to the last <lb/>
her habit of walking with her husband before breakfast <lb/>
to the daily morning service at church, she regularly <lb/>
drove thither in her pony carriage, "notwithstanding <lb/>
the remonstrances of her children, who in vain <reg orig="en-|treated">entreated</reg> <lb/>
her to abstain on foggy or rainy days from <lb/>
exposing herself to the raw atmosphere of North Wales <lb/>
at that early hour." Indeed, it is believed that it was <lb/>
greatly owing to her persistent sharing of the activity <lb/>
and Spartan vigour of her husband's life that she <lb/>
became even more hardy and vigorous in old age than <lb/>
she had been in her youth.</p>
<p>But when, after nearly sixty happy years together, <lb/>
the life - companion was called away, the spring of <lb/>
Mrs. Gladstone's own existence seemed broken. It <lb/>
was indeed with heroic calm and Christian faith that <lb/>
<pb n="157" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0328"/>
the grand old lady bore her loss, sweetly replying to <lb/>
one near and dear to her, when asked just as the <lb/>
funeral procession was starting if she could bear it, <lb/>
"Yes. God is so good; He took him from me on <lb/>
Ascension Day, and to-day is the eve of the festival <lb/>
of the Comforter"; yet none who had known them <lb/>
could believe, or scarcely hope, that the separation of <lb/>
those two hearts that for so great a while had beat <lb/>
as one could be for long. It was a beautiful action <lb/>
on the part of the heir of the British Empire when, <lb/>
on that sorrowful day at Westminster Abbey, he bent <lb/>
the knee to gently kiss the hand of the venerable widow, <lb/>
silently expressing his deep sympathy with one who <lb/>
in noble womanliness and conjugal devotion more <lb/>
closely resembled his own royal mother than perhaps <lb/>
did any other lady in the land.</p>
<p>Still the bereaved one bore up, not allowing her own <lb/>
great sorrow to make her indifferent to the griefs of <lb/>
others. Very soon after the death of Mr. Gladstone <lb/>
the Aston Hall colliery accident occurred, and she <lb/>
found leisure at once to visit and comfort the widows <lb/>
and friends of the two miners who were killed.</p>
<p>As the months wore on, however, it was noticed by <lb/>
tender watchers that the dear old lady's memory and <lb/>
mental faculties were beginning to fail, and she lived <lb/>
less in the present and more and more in the happy <lb/>
past. But her devotion to her husband was as strong <lb/>
as ever. Every day she was read aloud to by some <lb/>
member of her family, and next to chapters from the <lb/>
Book of books, nothing gave her so much pleasure <lb/>
as to hear extracts from Mr. Gladstone's writings, or <lb/>
passages referring to him written by others. Her <lb/>
interest in his long-past sayings and doings never <lb/>
seemed to flag.</p>
<pb n="158" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0329"/>
<p>A short time before the end one of her elder <reg orig="grand-|children">grandchildren</reg> <lb/>
was reading to her from the <hi rend="italic">Life of Gladstone</hi>, <lb/>
by Sir Wemyss Reid, which was published early in <lb/>
1899. When that part was reached which related to <lb/>
Sir Robert Peel's great Budget of 1842 the old lady <lb/>
became quite roused, and asked for the chapter dealing <lb/>
with the same matter to be read to her from the <hi rend="italic">Life <lb/>
of Peel</hi>, in the "Queen's Prime Ministers" series.</p>
<p>Then, turning to the young girl, scarcely emerged <lb/>
from childhood, Mrs. Gladstone betrayed how her sense <lb/>
of the flight of time was fading by the remark, "Why, <lb/>
my dear, you must surely remember how he talked that <lb/>
first time he breakfasted with us!"</p>
<p>In the early part of 1900 Mrs. Gladstone's bodily <lb/>
health failed more and more, though it was not until <lb/>
the middle or end of May that her relatives began <lb/>
to feel seriously alarmed. She was then in so weak <lb/>
a state that Dr. Dobie was called in; yet even at that <lb/>
time it was not believed that her condition was really <lb/>
dangerous. Her debility, however, of both mind and <lb/>
body increased, and much of the venerable patient's <lb/>
time was passed in a dozing or half-conscious <reg orig="con-|dition">condition</reg>.</p>
<p>After a week or so there was a slight rally, but it <lb/>
was not maintained, and it became evident that Mrs. <lb/>
Gladstone was sinking. For several days and nights <lb/>
she slept continuously, and "as tranquilly as a child," <lb/>
until on the afternoon of June 14th, without regaining <lb/>
consciousness, she passed peacefully away.</p>
<p>Years before, Mr. Gladstone had expressed the wish <lb/>
that wherever he might be buried his beloved wife <lb/>
should share the same grave. Therefore, when in 1898 <lb/>
the remains of the great statesman were interred among <lb/>
his peers in the honoured precincts of Westminster <lb/>
<pb n="159" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0330"/>
Abbey, it was arranged that a place should be reserved <lb/>
for Mrs. Gladstone when her call came to follow him. <lb/>
So, lying beneath the same gold-embroidered, white <lb/>
silk pall, worked by the grateful hands of the Armenians <lb/>
whose cause he had championed, that two years before <lb/>
had covered the coffin of her husband, all that was <lb/>
mortal of this good woman was carried to its rest in the <lb/>
grey old pile, and with tears of genuine love and <lb/>
reverence was laid by his side.</p>
<p>The people of Hawarden were gratified by the <reg orig="dis-|tinction">distinction</reg> <lb/>
justly awarded to their noble friends, even <lb/>
while they regretted that the village churchyard could <lb/>
not have been the last resting-place of the pair who had <lb/>
lived and loved among them for so many years. "Not <lb/>
one belonging to the village have I met to-day," wrote <lb/>
the correspondent of one of our great dailies, visiting the <lb/>
historic spot while the funeral was pending, "who has <lb/>
not related some little act of kindness of Mrs. Gladstone <lb/>
personal to themselves. They speak of her, not as the <lb/>
great one from the Castle, but as a near and dear friend, <lb/>
who was ever ready with acts of kindly helpfulness and <lb/>
womanly sympathy; of one who earnestly strove to <lb/>
live the Christlike life of self-forgetfulness and <reg orig="un-|conscious">unconscious</reg> <lb/>
personal sacrifice. The memory of Catherine <lb/>
Gladstone will shine forth like a religious light, giving <lb/>
spiritual guidance in the darkness of a selfish world."</p>
<p>At the funeral the Queen and the Prince and Princess <lb/>
of Wales were represented, in addition to a crowd of <lb/>
Mr. Gladstone's friends and former colleagues. Our <lb/>
gracious sovereign, with ever-ready sympathy, had <lb/>
already sent the following telegram to Mrs. Wickham:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Pray accept my sincerest expression of sympathy <lb/>
and regret at your dear mother's death, whose invariable <lb/>
kindness to me for so many years I shall ever gratefully <lb/>
<pb n="160" entity="Chappell_NobleWorkers_0331"/>
remember. Pray express my feelings to your brothers <lb/>
and sisters.&mdash;V.R.I."</p>
<p>Among the wreaths sent were tributes from the <lb/>
Prince and Princess of Wales and the Duke of York; <lb/>
the Princess adding to hers the following inscription:&mdash;</p>
<p>"In memory of dear Mrs. Gladstone.</p>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"'It is but crossing, with a bated breath,</l>
