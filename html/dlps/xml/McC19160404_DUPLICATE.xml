            April 4th, 1916
            
            Dear Marcelle:
            
            I was mighty glad
            to get your letter but sorry
            to know you aren’t feeling
            exactly right.  Those depressed
            feelings come to me too and
            I cannot find the source of 
            them.  I felt rather badly
            this morning too until I
            entered and found your letter
            and a letter from Betty’s
            mother telling me that her 
            daughter had shown marked
            improvement.
            
            They tell me I am to
            be sent to the reserve as
            soon as my perfectionment on
            the Nieuport is finished.  I
            have done more than is called
            
            
            [2]
            
            for and am only waiting for 
            Lieut. Chavane to return from
            permission before leaving for
            Plessis-Belleville.  I believe I
            shall have to go directly thru [sic]
            but trust I can get a day
            or two in Paris afterwards.
            I certainly want to see you,
            Marcelle.
            
            It seems queer being the
            first to leave over at
            the Nieuport place.  I remember
            so well when I was on
            the Morane there and looked
            up to the Nieuport men.
            Then when on the Nieuport
            23 meter I looked up to
            those on the 18 meter and
            the men that were leaving
            for Belleville I regarded as
            regular pilots.  Now that
            I’m first in the school
            I don’t feel as if I knew [sic]
            much about flying.  Thank
            
            
            
            [3]
            
            
            goodness I won’t have to
            be perfectioned at Belleville
            and wait around the way
            others have tho [sic] I believe
            that if I am given a 13
            meter I’ll have to put in
            a certain number of hours
            on it.
            
            It was nice of 
            Mary Lines to write me in
            detail about Betty’s condition.
            Hope to see her in Paris
            and thank her personally.
            Speaking of Paris I feel a
            sort of shame at going
            there after the exhibition
            I gave the last time I 
            was in the city.
            
            Hope to see you in
            a few days.
            
            Didn’t you get the photos
            I sent you?
            
            Yours
            Jim.
            
            [With this letter is an envelope addressed to Madmoiselle Marcelle Guerin, 148 Bis Rue de Longchamp, XVI, Paris.]
