          (the "Program") to purchase bonds and other debt instruments issued by public institutions
          of higher education in the Commonwealth of Virginia (the "Institutions") to finance or
          refinance the construction of projects of capital improvement specifically included in a

          by the Authority to the Institution pursuant to the Loan Agreement by issuing the

          <p> Section 6. The Board acknowledges, on behalf of the Institution, that if the
            Institution fails to make any payments of debt service due under any Loan Agreement or
            Note, including the 2002A Loan Agreement and the 2002A Note, the Program authorizes the
            State Comptroller to charge against the appropriations available to the Institution all
            future payments of debt service on that Loan Agreement and Note when due and payable and
            to make such payments to the Authority or its designee, so as to ensure that no future
            default will occur on such Loan Agreement or Note.</p>
          <p> Section 7. The Board agrees that if the Authority determines that the Institution
            is an "obligated person" under Rule 15c2-12 of the Securities and Exchange Commission
            with respect to any issue of Bonds, the Institution will enter into a continuing
