                <p>Addie says she has read the military order prohibiting furloughs, even for sick
                    and wounded, and admonishes Charles to be careful of his health so she won't
                    worry. She further talks about mutual friends and a photograph she received from
                    Charlie.</p>

                <p> Even to old Mecca<lb/> your precious letter found its way and how<lb/> joyfully
                    I received and read it.<lb/> Dearest, while reading your noble and true
                    thoughts<lb/> I can hardly realize that <orig reg="hundreds">hun<lb/>
                    dreds</orig> and hundreds of miles separate us. I seem to see<lb/> you and
                    listen to your darling words. your<lb/> presence seems ever near me
                    strengthening<lb/> me to bear this ordeal through which I<lb/> am passing - our
                    separation. But I sat down<lb/> to answer your letter.<lb/> How sorry I was dear
                    that you could not<lb/> obtain a leave of absence. I read the order<lb/>
                    <pb n="2" entity="DSSR_000000766_0172"/>
                    <orig reg="prohibiting">prohibitting</orig> furloughs - even to the sick
                    and<lb/> wounded. I think it too bad Dost wonder<lb/> dearest that I read it
                    with a sinking heart.<lb/> Now Charlie you must be <hi rend="underline">very</hi>
                     <hi rend="underline">very</hi> careful in<lb/> regard to your health for should
                    you be taken<lb/> ill, the blessed boon of "coming home" would<lb/> be refused
                    and think you I could live knowing<lb/> that Charlie was ill and suffering :
                    no<lb/> never! I am glad that you have some more<lb/> favorable approximation of
                    writing for I have missed<lb/> your welcome letters very much but darling after<lb/>
                    <del hand="h1" rend="line-through">g</del> receiving such a reproof I trust I
                    shall<lb/> never again be guilty of scolding you even if you<lb/> do not write
                        but <hi rend="underline">once</hi> <hi rend="underline">a</hi> <hi
                        rend="underline">month</hi>. Your rebuke<lb/> was the more affectual because
                    it was given so<lb/> quietly but I will try <hi rend="underline">never</hi> to
                    mind one again.<lb/> Am I not a good girl for <orig reg="promising"
                    >promissing</orig> so readily ?<lb/> Wait and see how well I fullfil it. So
                    be<lb/> sure darling. I should love to receive the
                    __<unclear>kiss</unclear><lb/> but I should prefer receiving it from a
                    different<lb/> motive No, no dearest I do not needlessly<lb/> suffer on account
                    of you and Hallie for if you<lb/> and Hal should be taken away what oh what<lb/>
                    <pb n="3" entity="DSSR_000000766_0173"/> would be life ? A wilderness deprived
                    of all<lb/> its charms?. Do not call it needless anxiety<lb/> Oh! what a letter
                    her Hal wrote me a few days<lb/> since. He says "Addie", Charlie is <hi
                        rend="underline">very</hi> dear to<lb/> you, so is your brother but rather
                        than <orig reg="protract">pro-<lb/> tract</orig> this war by a final defeat
                    at Richmond<lb/> let us both be found dead on the field and<lb/> let our last
                    words be "Onward to Victory<lb/> and Union!" Why did Hallie write me such<lb/> a
                    letter. Ah! how fearfully my heart beat while<lb/> reading it and it does now.
                    But I will<lb/> not dwell on such thoughts. Jesus will<lb/> spare you darling
                    and I know God will.<lb/> I had not heard of Edwin Williams death<lb/> His pooor
                    sister Heda ! If she loved him a<lb/> sincerely as he did her I fear the
                    knowledge<lb/> was a fearful blow. While speaking of her<lb/> I have seen the
                    tears spring to his eyes<lb/> and she would be obliged to leave the room<lb/>
                    because he would not repress his emotions.<lb/> How many a noble youth has
                    fallen while striving<lb/> to supress this rebellion "I think you are a learned
                    man<lb/> is all the answer I shall make in regard to<lb/>
                    <pb n="4" entity="DSSR_000000766_0174"/> the remarks you made upon
                    Catholicism<lb/> You gave me a beautiful description of the 4th.<lb/> I believe
                    I have written once or twice how I spent<unclear/><lb/> "When future favors
                    Charlie will come " When did you not<lb/> say. "When the coming present favours
                    you" for the future<lb/> never comes. Strange that you do not hear from Hal<lb/>
                    He tells me that he writes often to you. Laura has<lb/> answered for herself and
                    Dora might answer if she<lb/> would but she she says she does not know whether
                    she<lb/> is an idiot or a girl of sense for it is so warm<lb/> and she attended
                    a party last evening and feels<lb/> the effects of it. You wrote me in regards
                    to Laurie's<lb/> initiative. Certainly you can have it if she will let<lb/> you
                    but you may receive a "No sire" I guess not though.<lb/>
                </p>

                <p>Your photograph darling I do not think is natural<lb/> at least not as you looked
                    when I last<add place="inline" hand="h1"> also first</add> saw you<lb/> I like
                    the position very much. I was very thankful<lb/> for it darling. Oh Charlie if
                    you could but<lb/> hear the conversation between Laura Dora and<lb/> Auntie.
                    Dora is just lived enough to be full<lb/> of fun and let them converse about
                    what they<lb/> will Dora will make them laugh<lb/>
                </p>

                <p> But time flies and I must close write<lb/> often as you can and may guardian
                    angels attend<lb/> you in all your wanderings.<lb/>
