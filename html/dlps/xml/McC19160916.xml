            <salute>Dear Paul:</salute>
            </opener>
            
            <p>
            Nothing now save that my
            back is better and I hope to
            get out soon.
            </p><p>
            An orderly here took a photo
            of yours truly in front of barracks
            I was in at first.  I look damn
            thin.  Will you get a couple of
            prints made from the inclosed [sic] film.
            </p><p>
            My friend Betty Baldwin has
            been keeping me supplied with magazines 
            and letters.  Damn nice of her.  Some
            one sent me a bunch of N.Y. Times
            Lifes and Smart Sets and I can’t
            figure out who &mdash; wasn’t Marcelle.
            </p><p>
            This place is getting on the
            bum.  We are 40 in ward now and
            as there’s too much work for orderly
            I don’t get any more massage.  The
            crapper’s stopped up and the contents
            remain to permeate the salle with
            their mephitic redolence and the outer
            one is always occupied so I have
            to go to town to perform the
            function.
            </p><p>
            The war looks to be moving
            
            <pb n="[p.2]"/>
            
            towards the end don’t you think?
            Not that I imagine it will end
            before another year but it seems
            patent that we have the Huns on
            the down slope and that its
            easier sliding than we had imagined.
            For the first time we seem able to 
            go thru em [sic] when, where and whither
            we want.  My friend Marshall
            got another citation at Verdun.  De Sillac
            wrote me he had succeeded in having
            him transfered [sic] to aviation but the
            boy has no orders as yet.  Do 
            you think De S <del hand="author" rend="line-through">would</del> is such an
            ass that he’d write before it was
            positive or not?
