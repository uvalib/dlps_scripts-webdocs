                <head>REPORT BY THE PRESIDENT</head>
               <p>The Board reconvened at 8:00 a.m., in Open Session, on Saturday,
                        <date value="2006-04-08">April 8, 2006</date>, in the Board Room of the
                    Rotunda, to hear the President’s customary report. All Members present the day
                    before, save <name>Mr. Pippin</name>, were present.</p>
               <p>The President reported first on the General Assembly session this
                    winter. The management agreements, which the University and other institutions
                    negotiated, were approved by both houses of the Legislature in two separate
                    bills. They now must be signed by the Governor.</p>
               <p>The bill which covers the Commonwealth’s budget is still in
                    debate, however, although there may be a resolution of the matter in the General
                    Assembly next week. He commented that in spite of the impasse, he believes the
                    outcome will be positive because both houses of the Legislature are committed to
                    higher education.</p>
               <p>The President said that preliminary figures for March indicate a
                    Campaign cash flow of $16.5million, which would put the year-to-date (that is,
                    since July 1, 2005) total at about $177million. Total Campaign giving through
                    February stands at $836.6million; with the March preliminary figures added to
                    that, Campaign giving to date is just over $854million.</p>
                <p rend="indent">These figures do not include the recent Ivy Foundation gift of
                    $45million, nor another $5million gift to the Darden School and the Curry
                    School. If these are added in, the total Campaign figure is at $900million.</p>
               <p>The President reported that the Campaign case statement is being
                    perfected and that alumni advice and support continues to be sought. He said
                    that since his last report to the Board, there have been 14 meetings in 14
                    different cities across the country, with 608 people attending. In April and
                    early May there will be 11 events in 10 cities on the East Coast, in Texas, and
                    in the Midwest. </p>

                        $160.6million, an increase of $30.4million, or 23%, above the previous

                    affiliation, or against otherwise qualified persons with disabilities. The

               <p>State appointing authorities and other management principals are
                    hereby directed to take affirmative measures, as determined by the Director of
                    the Department of Human Resource Management, to emphasize the recruitment of
                    qualified minorities, women, disabled persons, and older Virginians to serve at
                    all levels of state government. This directive does not permit or require the
                    lowering of bona fide job requirements, performance standards, or qualifications
                    to give preference to any state employee or applicant for state employment. </p>
               <p>Allegations of violations of this policy shall be brought to the
                    attention of the Office of Equal Employment Services of the Department of Human
                    Resource Management. No state appointing authority, other management principal,
                    or supervisor shall take retaliatory actions against persons making such
                    allegations. </p>
               <p>Any state employee found in violation of this policy shall be
                    subject to appropriate disciplinary action. </p>
               <p>The Secretary of Administration is directed to review annually
                    state procurement, employment, and other relevant policies for compliance with
                    the non-discrimination mandate contained herein, and shall report to the
                    Governor his or her findings together with such recommendations as he or she
                    deems appropriate. The Director of the Department of Human Resource Management
                    shall assist in this review. </p>

                        reserves equivalent to three months of operating expenses and (b) annual
                        capital expenditures or contributions to capital reserves of at least 1.5
                        percent of replacement value of buildings and equipment. The exact
                        percentage should be based on the capital requirements unique to the
                        program. The Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer may
                        approve alternative reserve policies where appropriate; and </p>

                        <p>In support of its mission, the University of Virginia maintains a
                            long-term strategic plan. The strategic plan establishes University-wide
                            priorities as well as University-wide and divisional programmatic
                            objectives. The University develops a capital plan to support these
                            priorities and objectives. </p>
                        <p>The University’s use of debt plays a critical role in ensuring adequate
                            funding for the capital plan as well as providing a cost-effective
                            source of funding for other purposes. By linking the objectives of its
                            Debt Policy to its strategic objectives, the University ultimately
                            increases the likelihood of achieving its mission. The Debt Policy is
                            intended to be a “living” document that will evolve over time to meet
                            the changing needs of the University. </p>

                            fixed-rate, and variable-rate debt. It also covers other forms of
                            financing including both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet

                            an optimal amount of leverage, a strong financial profile, and a

                            debt, the University takes into account both its debt affordability and
                            debt capacity. Debt affordability focuses on the University’s ability to
                            service its debt through its operating budget and identified revenue
                            streams and is driven by strength in income and <pb n="4"/> cash flows.
                            Debt capacity focuses on the University’s financial leverage in terms of
                            debt funding as a percentage of the University’s total capital. </p>
                        <p> The University considers many factors in assessing its debt
                            affordability and debt capacity including its strategic plan, market
                            position, alternative sources of funding, and relationship with the
                            Commonwealth. The University uses four key ratios to provide a
                            quantitative assessment of debt affordability and debt capacity. </p>

                                    and debt capacity and is a critical consideration of

                            <p>A balanced approach is used to provide liquidity support to enhance
                                credit for variable-rate debt through a combination of external bank
                                liquidity, self-liquidity, auction market, or derivative structures.
                                Using a variety of approaches limits dependence on an individual
                                type or source of credit; it also allows for exposure to different
                                types of investors. The University must balance liquidity
                                requirements with its investment objectives and its cost and renewal
                                risk of third-party liquidity providers. </p>
                            <p>Further, a portfolio-approach to liquidity can enhance investment
                                flexibility, reduce administrative requirements, lower total
                                interest costs, and reduce the need for external bank liquidity.

                            capital projects, management must allocate debt strategically,
                            continuing to explore alternate sources of funding for projects.
                            External support, philanthropy, and direct Commonwealth investment
                            remain critical to the University’s facilities investment plan. </p>
                        <p>Management allocates the use of debt financing internally within the
                            University to reflect the prioritization of debt resources among all
                            uses, including plant and equipment financing, academic projects, and
                            projects with trans-institutional impact. Generally, the University
                            favors debt financing for those projects critical to the attainment of
                            its strategic goals and those projects with identified revenue streams
                            for the repayment of debt service and incremental operating costs.
                            Federal research projects receive priority consideration for external
                            debt financing because the University receives partial reimbursement of
                            operating expenses (including the interest component of applicable
                            external debt service) of research facilities. Patient care investments
                            that have acceptable financial and programmatic returns also receive

                        <p>Each capital project is analyzed at its inception to ensure that capital

                            University. There is an initial <pb n="12"/> institutional review of
                            each project, prior to its inclusion in the state’s six-year plan, to
                            determine if debt leveraging would be desirable even if not requested by
                            the project sponsor. As part of this initial institutional review, the
                            University also will assess, based on the project’s business plan, the
                            sufficiency of revenues to support any internal loans. If the University
                            determines that collateral is necessary, it may require the entity to

                            complies with all statutory and regulatory requirements including
                            notifying the State Treasurer of each such bond issuance. For debt
                            issued under the Restructuring Act, the BOV delegates the authority to
                            approve the pricing of such debt to the VP &amp; CFO with the Chair
                            of the Finance Committee or such other BOV member as may be designated
                            by the Rector. Such pricing must be within the financing parameters
                            established for the debt by the BOV (or the Executive Committee as
                            authorized by Virginia Code § 23-75.)</p>

                        <p> The University maintains a Debt Policy which provides guidelines on the
                            authorization and management of debt. The University manages its debt
                            portfolio on a consolidated basis and makes debt management decisions to
                            achieve the lowest cost of debt capital and maximize its portfolio
                            objectives. The use of derivatives can play a key role in managing the
                            University’s debt portfolio. </p>
                        <p> In certain circumstances, derivatives are an effective way for the
                            University to adjust its mix of fixed- and floating-rate debt and manage
                            interest rate exposures. Derivatives may also be an effective way to
                            manage liquidity risks. The University’s philosophy is to use
                            derivatives strategically to achieve asset and liability portfolio
                            objectives and hedge existing exposures. Derivatives will not be used to
                            create leverage or to speculate on the movement of interest rates. </p>

                            is also the University’s philosophy to not use derivatives to create

                        <p> The University may use derivatives to achieve the lowest possible cost
                            of debt funding, manage its exposure to interest rate volatility, and/or
                            match the timing and nature of cash flows associated with its assets and
                            liabilities. The University may accomplish this by hedging the interest
                            rate volatility of projected debt issuances or by using derivatives to
                            adjust its exposure to floating interest rates. </p>
                        <p> To determine its portfolio exposure, the University looks at the
                            composition of its outstanding <hi rend="bold">assets</hi> and
                            liabilities (adjusted for any hedges) and the change in this composition
                            over a predetermined planning horizon. Taking into account the potential
                            for future uncertainty, the University determines what, if any, action
                            should be taken to keep its portfolio exposure at desirable levels over
                            this period. </p>
                        <p> In determining when to hedge, the University monitors its interest rate
                            exposure, the capital markets, and its future funding and liquidity
                            requirements. Special attention is <pb n="4"/> paid to the relative
                            level of interest rates, the shape of the yield curve, and signals of
                            interest rate increases or decreases from the Federal Reserve. </p>
                        <p> The University analyzes and quantifies the cost/benefit of any
                            derivative instrument relative to achieving desirable long-term capital
                            structure objectives. Before entering into a derivative, the University
                            evaluates its risks including, but not limited to: tax risk, interest
                            rate risk, liquidity risk, credit risk, basis risk, rollover risk,
                            termination risk, counterparty risk, and amortization risk. The
                            University also evaluates the impact the hedge will have on its debt
                            portfolio at the inception of the hedge and over the planning period.</p>
                        <p> When evaluating its hedging options, the University generally prefers
                            the lowest cost, most liquid, and most flexible hedging strategy
                            available. In instances where nohedging strategy meets all these needs,
                            the University prioritizes these requirements to decide on an optimal
                            strategy.</p>
                        <p> At their inception, derivatives are chosen to closely matchthe exposures
                            being hedged. As time passes, the University’s debt management
                            objectives may change, and any decisions will be made with the best
                            information available at that time regardless of hedges that may be in
                            place. For instance, the University may use derivatives to hedge future
                            interest rates associated with a fixed- rate bond issuance. If at the
                            time of issuance it is deemed more beneficial to issue floating-rate
                            bonds, then the University will not let its past hedging decisions
                            constrain its current bond issuance decisions.</p>

                                to provide protection against interest rates being above a certain
