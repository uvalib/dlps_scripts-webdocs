                    meeting in joint session on <date value="2001-06-06">June 4, 2001</date>,

                <p> RESOLVED that the Board accepts the preliminary report given by the group,
                    requests the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer to develop a

                <p>The Board resumed once more in Executive Session at 2:00 p.m., and met in that
                    state until 3:00 p.m., when it adopted the customary resolution certifying that
                    only business exempted from Open discussion by the Virginia Freedom of
                    Information Act had been considered.</p>

                <p>Mr. Rector, I move that we vote on and record our certification that, to the best
                    of each Board member's knowledge, only public business matters lawfully exempted
                    from open meeting requirements and which were identified in the motion(s)
                    authorizing the closed session, were heard, discussed or considered in closed

                <p>Resuming in Open Session, the Board heard a report from <name>Mrs. Holland</name>
                    on the fall meeting for boards of visitors organized by the State Council for
                    Higher Education in Virginia, which will take place on October 24<hi rend="super">th</hi>, in
                    Williamsburg. <name>Mr. Rainey</name> then reported on an effort by the Board of Managers of
                    the Alumni Association to raise money for the Honor Endowment. The Board of
                    Managers has pledged &dollar;250,000 to this end and through <name>Mr. Rainey</name> has
                    suggested that the Board of Visitors do the same. Most of the money from the
                    Board of Visitors should come from Endowment funds, he said, but he thought it
                    important that individual Members make personal contributions.</p>
