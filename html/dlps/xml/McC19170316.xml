            <p>
            I was mighty glad to
            get your letter which came this
            morning and to know you are having
            such a nice time.  I’m sure the
            change is welcome.  I didn’t know your
            address before and hence couldn’t
            write.
            </p><p>
            Your mother’s package of
            cake and pate’ that was sent to
            the hospital was received here and
            much enjoyed.  I was very grateful.
            </p><p>
            You must have been in Marseille
            at the same time Paul was.  He’s
            still there I believe.
            </p><p>
            The same article that was in
            the English World’s work is in the 
            American ^W.W. and in the latter its much
            (over)
            
            <pb n="[p.2]"/>
            
            better presented with a great many
            photos.  If I had an extra copy
            I’d send you one but I haven’t.
            It was nice of you to compliment
            the last article.  The third will
            appear in London World’s Work at 
            least.  It was too late for book
            which is now out.
            </p><p>
            The season for flying has
            now opened and a lot of new
            things have been assigned us
            such as observation work too
            far in the lines for slow
            machines.  To day Lovell, Willis, two
            others and I went 35 kilometers
            inside to do reconnaissance.  We
            flew low and saw many ground
            details.  You know that the
            
            <pb n="[p.3]"/>
            
            Boches are preparing to withdraw all
            along this front and will retire
            to what is known as the
            Hidenburg line roughly approximated
            by Cambrai, St. Quentin - Chauny
            and Soissons.  They, by so doing,
            evacuate a fifth of the ground they
            hold in France.  They are tearing
            up railroads, burning towns and
            destroying everything in the area.
            Nearly all their artillery has been
            taken away and we were shot at
            only once.  They used ground machine
            guns on us, however, for the
            first time in my experience.  I
            could see the stream of luminous
            bullets going by me like water
            falling in the sunlight.  The other
            day my motor went back on me &amp;
            
            <pb n="[p.4]"/>
            
            I had to land in a field.  Had 
            been over the lines during an 
            attack,  flying low, because of the
            clouds, and I thought the motor
            was hit.  Lovell and Willis are
            doing very well.
            </p><p>
            Have a little partition room
            to myself and like it much better
            than rooming with some one.  Its
            just the size of a steamer cabin,
            and has been lots of fun fixing 
            up.  Navarre is back on the
            front and at our field.
            </p>

            <salute>Thank your mother for being
            so very nice to me and give 
            her my love, and keep some
            yourself.
