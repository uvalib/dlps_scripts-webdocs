<p>This course is not to train Landscape Architects in the <reg orig="engineer-|ing">engineering</reg> <lb/>
of a roadway. It is intended to help you to regain the skills <lb/>
of working with Engineers in preserving the scenic quality associated <lb/>
with park roads and parkways in the tradition of F. L. Olmsted, <lb/>
Gilmore Clarke, Michael Rapuano, Tommy Vint, Stanley Abbott, Dudley <lb/>
Bayliss and Ed Abbuel.</p>
<p><corr resp="gpm2a" sic="ASSHO">AASHO</corr> has said in its publication "A Guide for Highway Landscape <lb/>
and Environmental Design" (HLED-1, 1970) that Landscape Architects <lb/>
are to be involved in highways from the initial stages of location <lb/>
to the final development of the roadside. It is because of the <lb/>
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 that Federal Highways is <lb/>
required to include Landscape Architects on the interdisciplinary <lb/>
design team. Engineers are masters of geometrical calculations for <lb/>
alignment and for the structural components of the pavement and <lb/>
bridges, and for establishing cost-benefit ratios to justify <reg orig="con-|struction">construction</reg> <lb/>
of new roads. They have relegated the off-road features <lb/>
to Landscape Architects provided that requirements for safety, <lb/>
drainage, lighting, and sight distances are satisfied.</p>
<p>When we consider that one third of the traffic fatalities take <lb/>
place <hi rend="underline">off the pavement,</hi> Landscape Architects do indeed have a <lb/>
responsibility for the safety of users of the highways! It is <lb/>
incumbent on you to learn the language of the Engineers, to know <lb/>
and appreciate their capabilities and training, and to respect their <lb/>
aspirations as you respect your own. It is when you are in charge <lb/>
of projects that the responsibility for <hi rend="underline">all</hi> professional services <lb/>
is yours alone; and you will surely be in charge sometime in the <lb/>
future! I promise you!</p>
<p>If we are to have parklike roads, we must be trained to work <lb/>
with Engineers in their design. In park road construction we can <lb/>
assume that the pavement and other structures will be intrusions <lb/>
into a natural or historical environment; therefore, I am "anti <lb/>
road." We can justify intrusions only from the benefits to visitors <lb/>
who will come to this place and whose daily lives are made more <lb/>
meaningful from having experienced this Park. Otherwise, we are <lb/>
intruders rather than stewards of the landscape we are obliged <lb/>
to preserve. To deny visitors an opportunity to enjoy the Park's <lb/>
resource in the name of preservation is equally difficult to justify.</p>
<pb n="2" entity="z000000510_0003" pid="uva-lib:151440"/>
<p>This is the dilemma of conservation and of our professional <lb/>
conscience in the management of natural and cultural landscapes. <lb/>
Arguments have seldom resulted in acceptable compromises, and we <lb/>
never escape the soul-searching struggle to arrive at a rationale <lb/>
we can live with. Every road proposal presents new arguments and <lb/>
every Park presents its own unique set of circumstances to be <lb/>
wrestled with and resolved...and lived with forever after. It's <lb/>
an unforgiving world living with our commitment to protection of <lb/>
our resources.</p>
<p>While we argue for flatter slopes, we face the grand old oak <lb/>
just inside the limit-of-grading line...then we must decide whether <lb/>
to live with a slope too steep for safety or to cut the "magnificent <lb/>
monarch" to the ground. An elevated structure over an estuary may <lb/>
preserve the spawning shallows of the shad...but it's a difficult <lb/>
argument to win when the job is already over the cost estimate and <lb/>
you have an impossible deadline for completion.</p>
<p>The difficulty with park roads and parkways is that they soon <lb/>
become swallowed up on the larger road system. Rock Creek Park, <lb/>
the Baltimore-Washington, the Suitland and the George Washington <lb/>
Memorial Parkways have been taken over by mightier forces than our <lb/>
own. The East Leg of the Inner Loop, Route 295 along the Anacostia <lb/>
River, the E Street Expressway, Theodore Roosevelt Bridge over the <lb/>
Potomac, Military Road over Beach Drive in Rock Creek Park, all <lb/>
have been built in part on Park land. We simply did not defend the <lb/>
park land with enough determination to stop the Engineers. And we <lb/>
would have lost the Spout Run valley if the public had not protested <lb/>
the construction of Three Sisters bridge over the Potomac. We are <lb/>
required to preserve parkland <hi rend="underline">by law</hi>!</p>
<p>Within our responsibility to spend the taxpayer's dollar as <lb/>
frugally as possible, we wrestle with decisions of design economy <lb/>
versus aesthetics and pray that what we decide is truly in the <lb/>
public interest. In public service we landscape architects serve <lb/>
most effectively as protectors of the public land rather than as <lb/>
designers of roads. The task is not to build a road but to preserve <lb/>
the landscape by building a durable structure which concentrates <lb/>
visitor use in a way that provides maximum enjoyment and causes the <lb/>
<pb n="3" entity="z000000510_0004" pid="uva-lib:151441"/>
least intrusion into the Park. In the final analysis, it is the <lb/>
Park that we are obligated to protect and not a road! I am a <lb/>
Park Man.</p>
<p>The new road in Yellowstone between Norris Junction and Canyon <lb/>
Village is contrary to every principle that I advocate in the design <lb/>
of park roads. It is too straight; it is too wide; it severs animal <lb/>
habitat; and visitors tend to use the road as a thing in time and <lb/>
place to be tolerated rather than as a means of enjoying the Park. <lb/>
The Engineers built a road to satisfy the cost benefit ratio and <lb/>
the structural requirements for traffic and the site. The sin of <lb/>
the road is on the backs of Landscape Architects who neither opposed <lb/>
the plan during the design stage nor collaborated with the Engineers <lb/>
during construction.</p>
<p>We have not kept abreast of the developing art of preservation; <lb/>
neither have we kept our traditional training in road construction <lb/>
in the schools offering degrees in Landscape Architecture. Instead, <lb/>
we have surrendered our tradition and in the process have abandoned <lb/>
our role as collaborators with the Engineers. We have become <reg orig="intimi-|dated">intimidated</reg> <lb/>
by the skills we once regarded as our own; it is up to your <lb/>
generation to reestablish the role of Landscape Architects working <lb/>
with Engineers in the art of park roads and parkway design.</p>
<p>The Nation is now on the threshold of launching a program for <lb/>
the reconstruction of a network of scenic roads and byways. If <lb/>
you are not prepared to assume a responsible role, then construction <lb/>
will prevail over scenery, and bypasses will prevail over pleasure <lb/>
roads. The public needs your talent; you cannot be negligent in <lb/>
offering to help!</p>

<p>The geometry of road design begins with an origin and a <reg orig="des-|tination">destination</reg>; <lb/>
this we translate into a direction. It is then through <lb/>
a series of judgments employing our skills in fitting the ribbon <lb/>
to lay lightly on the Land that we design the roadway. The simplest <lb/>
design, of course, is a straight line connecting the origin and the <lb/>
destination without regard for the topography or for those features <lb/>
outside of the corridor within which the road is to be constructed. <lb/>
Instead, we landscape architects strive to describe a line of <reg orig="ever-|changing">ever-changing</reg> <lb/>
curvature in locating <hi rend="underline">the</hi> road that will preserve the <lb/>
natural and historic landscape, that will least intrude on animal <lb/>
habitat, that will lay like a feather on the ground surface, that <lb/>
opens views to scienic features on the skyline, and that insures <lb/>
safety for motorists who will use the roadway.</p>
<p>We begin the design with a 314 pencil on study paper over a <lb/>
topo map. The first line we draw will set the quality for what <lb/>
follows! It is the reverence we have for the Land and the <reg orig="exalta-|tion">exaltation</reg> <lb/>
that comes when a beautiful line flows through the pencil that <lb/>
designs a road! If our hearts don't beat with trepidation at that <lb/>
moment, we'd do well to put the pencil down. Walk away! The <reg orig="intru-|sion">intrusion</reg> <lb/>
onto the Landscape and the consequences of construction are too <lb/>
devastating to begin poorly.</p>
<p>Once we are inspired by images of that graceful movement over <lb/>
the Landscape, we are compelled to draw the ribbon. The side of <lb/>
the pencil leaves broad strokes of graceful curves that fairly <lb/>
skate along the contours in a joyful melody in the out-of-doors. <lb/>
That's road design, That's Landscape Architecture!</p>

<head rend="left"><hi rend="underline">THOUGHTS ON THE HISTORY OF ROADS</hi></head>
<p>The anthropologists tell us that the human species originated <lb/>
in the savannahs of Africa, a landscape netted with animal trails <lb/>
connecting watering places to grazing places to nesting places. As <lb/>
the lower waterholes dried up each year, the herds moved to higher <lb/>
ground&mdash;and the early people followed as nomads on the migration trails.</p>
<p>When the early people invented The Wheel&mdash;and when they <reg orig="domesti-|cated">domesticated</reg> <lb/>
The Horse&mdash;I do not know. But when they placed their burdens <lb/>
on an axle between two wheels to be drawn by a horse, the trails <lb/>
became two parallel tracks across The Land. We do know that the <lb/>
people of the Middle East built a system of roads over the trade <lb/>
routes and that the Greeks extended their military power over much <lb/>
of that known world. It was the system of chariot roads that bound <lb/>
together the Empire under Rome from the British Isles to the Holy Land.</p>
<p>The Horse, remember, had occupied much of North America before <lb/>
the Ice Age&mdash;and disappeared before the first humans crossed the <lb/>
narrow bridge of ice from Asia. The American Indian waited for the <lb/>
Spanish Horse for over thirty thousand years if our interpretation <lb/>
is reasonable. The Spanish carved a net of roads from Central <lb/>
America to Florida and California and north to the Rockies and Plains. <lb/>
What early Indian became the first Horseman able at last to pursue <lb/>
the buffalo? and to fashion a teepee and travois to mark the American <lb/>
Landscape along the buffalo trail?</p>
<p>The French, in their quest for furs, pushed upstream from the <lb/>
St. Lawrence to Great Lakes to the Upper Mississippi and Missouri <lb/>
and then downstream to the Gulf. They were voyageurs rather than <lb/>
builders of roads. An American historian compared the early <reg orig="Euro-|peans">Europeans</reg>: <lb/>
"The Spanish came for gold; the French came for furs; the <lb/>
English came to stay." And so it was left to the English to build <lb/>
the Kings Highway and Post Roads and to settle the Tidewater of the <lb/>
Eastern Seaboard. The science of canal building was borrowed from <lb/>
Europe to extend commerce and settlement above The Fall Line to <lb/>
cross the Piedmont and thereby secure the British settlement against <lb/>
the French who extended their influence into the Ohio.</p>
<p>It was the system of land grants and patterns of settlement that <lb/>
followed the great rivers that caused roads in the East to become <lb/>
<pb n="6" entity="z000000510_0010" pid="uva-lib:151447"><fw type="sig" place="top-right">L-1</fw></pb>
meandering rather than straight. And it was the rectangular system <lb/>
of surveys that caused roads west of the Appalachians to follow <lb/>
straight lines rather than meandering routes.</p>
<p>Westward Expansion into the Northwest Territory required roads <lb/>
and canals to cross the mountains. The National Road was started <lb/>
from Baltimore and the Erie and C &amp; O Canals were started from <lb/>
Albany and Washington to reach the newly acquired lands. And in an <lb/>
accident of time, the steam locomotive arrived to challenge the <lb/>
freight wagon and canal barge.</p>
<p>The Horse pulled the wagons across the Western Plains and The <lb/>
Rockies before the railroads met at Golden Spike in Utah. A system <lb/>
of roads had been built westward to supply the Army forts along the <lb/>
Oregon and the Mormon and Sante Fe Trails. Railroads were extended <lb/>
to parallel the early roads and in some places were built over the <lb/>
towpaths of the early canals.</p>
<p>The Civil Engineer had made the canals and railroads his realm <lb/>
while he computed the excavation for waterways and tunnels, the <reg orig="grad-|ient">gradient</reg> <lb/>
for lift locks, and the curvature for steel tracks. He developed <lb/>
tables for faster calculations and for uniformity of standards for <lb/>
construction. He refined transition curves and superelevation of <lb/>
tracks to provide a smoother ride and reduce maintenance of rolling <lb/>
stock hauling the coal from the Appalachians to the cities and <lb/>
factories of the East in a change from water-driven machines to steam <lb/>
power.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, The Horse did what he'd done for decades: he worked <lb/>
the farm, trotted the family to town, and was the pride of the avenue <lb/>
and racetrack. Several of the Eastern States, in an effort "to get <lb/>
the farmer out of the mud", built a system of farm-to-market roads. <lb/>
Until 1918, remember, most Americans lived on farms, dependent on <lb/>
The Horse for their livelihood whether they sold or consumed the <lb/>
product of their labors. The hard-surfaced roads enabled The Horse <lb/>
to draw heavier loads than he could drag through the mud&mdash;and he <lb/>
could pull a car over steel rails even easier.</p>
<p>The bicycle flourished on the new hard surfaced roads, especially <lb/>
after Mr. Firestone and other inventors discovered a way to make a <lb/>
rubber tire to soften the ride and reduce the noise on the streets.</p>

<p>Henry Ford didn't invent the motor car&mdash;but he did introduce <lb/>
methods which led to mass production of the machine at a cost many <lb/>
Americans could afford. The farm-to-market roads were overtaken by <lb/>
the motor car; then a box was placed over the rear axle and the <lb/>
American farmer acquired a Truck! I don't know when the Ford Tractor <lb/>
appeared on the family farm&mdash;but it was the farm-to-market road, the <lb/>
motor car, and the tractor that caused the decline of Americans' love <lb/>
affair with The Horse. In 1916 the first Federal Aid for Highways <lb/>
Act was passed by the Congress to provide a nationwide system of <lb/>
roadways for motor cars. The Horse has served Americans from the <lb/>
1500s&mdash;over four hundred years!</p>
<p>Frederick Law Olmsted had designed the carriage roads of our <lb/>
Country's great city parks before America was off and running into <lb/>
the Age of the Automobile. He had designed bridges to separate <lb/>
carriage traffic, and roads of ever-changing curvature for pleasure <lb/>
in a rural landscape before the Civil Engineers switched their <reg orig="atten-|tion">attention</reg> <lb/>
from railroads to roadways. The partnership of Gilmore Clark, <lb/>
Landscape Architect, and Jay Downer, Civil Engineer, led to the <lb/>
interdisciplinary design of the Bronx River Parkway in 1922 and <lb/>
the system of parkways in Westchester County.</p>
<p>Tommy Vint authored the interbureau agreement in 1926 which <lb/>
provided for the design of park roads within the National Park <lb/>
System to be done by Landscape Architects of the National Park <lb/>
Service working with Civil Engineers of the Bureau of Public Roads. <lb/>
Out of that agreement came the Blue Ridge Parkway, and then Skyline <lb/>
Drive and Colonial Parkway; Stan Abbott and Ed Abbuel, Landscape <lb/>
Architects of the Park Service worked with Engineers of the Bureau <lb/>
of Public Roads during those years of the early 1930s.</p>
<p>The high-speed Autobahns built as defense highways in Germany <lb/>
during the 30s so impressed General Eisenhower that he urged Congress <lb/>
to authorize the 46,000 mile Interstate System in 1956. Until the <lb/>
1950s when Detroit reached record auto production, the railroads <lb/>
had been the primary carriers of freight and passengers. Long <reg orig="dis-|tance">distance</reg> <lb/>
bus travel and rapid truck deliveries over Interstate Highways <lb/>
caused the railroads to decline; the failure of the railroads to <lb/>
restore pre-World WarII passenger service and the abundance of <reg orig="low-|cost">low-cost</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="8" entity="z000000510_0012" pid="uva-lib:151449"><fw type="sig" place="top-right">L-1</fw></pb>
gasoline encouraged Americans to travel longer distances by <lb/>
private automobile.</p>
<p>The Interstate Highway System was indeed influenced by the <lb/>
successful features of the Parkways designed by Landscape Architects <lb/>
and Highway Engineers. The Palisades, Taconic and Merritt Parkways <lb/>
were limited-access roadways. The Parkways built in the Washington <lb/>
area (Suitland to Andrews AFB, Baltimore-Washington to Fort Meade, <lb/>
and George Washington Memorial Parkway to CIA Langley) were designed <lb/>
by NPS Landscape Architects working with Highway Engineers of The <lb/>
Bureau under the 1926 agreement authored by Tommy Vint. The American <lb/>
Society of Landscape Architects elected Jay Downer and Frederick <lb/>
Cron, two top-notch Highway Engineers, to Honorary Membership in the <lb/>
Society. (Joseph Barnett, I have read, was also an honorary member.)</p>
<p>The State Highway Officials organized to lay out a national code <lb/>
of uniform traffic controls and safety practices which proved to be <lb/>
effective during the construction of the Interstate System. Funds <lb/>
amounting to 90% of construction costs were allocated to the States <lb/>
to design and build those segments of the System within their <reg orig="juris-|dictions">jurisdictions</reg>. <lb/>
The Bureau of Public Roads was reorganized to become the <lb/>
Federal Highway Administration in the Department of Commerce to <lb/>
administer the funds allocated to the States and to insure compliance <lb/>
with the guidelines laid down by AASHO.</p>
<p>The displacement and relocation of neighborhoods and families, <lb/>
the accelerated rates of run-off, and the increased hazards of <lb/>
water and air pollution due to highway construction became public <lb/>
concerns. The Highway Beautification Act of 1965, the National <lb/>
Highway Safety Act of 1966, and the National Environmental Policy <lb/>
Act of 1969 were expressions of public opposition to the effects <lb/>
brought about by the Interstate System. Signboards and visual <lb/>
encroachments were regulated, roadside hazards were reduced, the <lb/>
National Highway Safety Council was established, and environmental <lb/>
impact statements were required. The luxury automobile, <reg orig="mile-a-|minute">mile-a-minute</reg> <lb/>
travel time, and the monotony of constant high speeds over <lb/>
extended distances had arrived.</p>
<p>In 1972 the whole scheme suddenly stopped by what we now call <lb/>
"The Fuel Crisis." The earlier prophesies by the scientists were <lb/>
<pb n="9" entity="z000000510_0013" pid="uva-lib:151450"><fw type="sig" place="top-right">L-1</fw></pb>
fulfilled&mdash;"the fossil fuels" (oil) was being exhausted by <reg orig="auto-|mobiles">automobiles</reg>! <lb/>
The economic power of the world shifted to the oil <reg orig="pro-|ducing">producing</reg> <lb/>
countries&mdash;and the results were restrictions in the gasoline <lb/>
supply, reduction of travel speeds at 55 MPH, and the redesign of <lb/>
the automobile to increase fuel economy.</p>

<p>Is the high speed freeway obsolete? What effects will rapid <lb/>

our concepts of travel? What are the alternatives in terms of fuels? <lb/>

<head rend="left"><hi rend="underline">COMPARISON OF PRIORITIES:</hi></head>
<p>In 1972, the Year of the Fuel Crisis, 56,600 Americans were <lb/>
killed on the highways. Today the rate is about 46,000, a reduction <lb/>
brought about by the 55 MPH enforced speed limit, and other safety <lb/>
improvements. The combat deaths during the War in VietNam were <lb/>
about 46,600; training accidents, sickness and other causes boosted <lb/>
that total to 56,600&mdash;ironically the same as our 1972 highway <lb/>
fatalities.</p>
<p>Can we Landscape Architects help in saving American lives? <lb/>
I believe we can.</p>

<p>The National Highway Safety Act of 1966 laid down eighteen <lb/>
standards authored by AASHO to improve highway safety through design. <lb/>
Most deal with roadside design for which we landscape architects <lb/>
have special responsibility.</p>
<p>The fact that about a third of the traffic deaths involve <lb/>
collisions with some fixed objects within thirty feet of the <reg orig="pave-|ment">pavement</reg> <lb/>

<p>The "Yellow Book" has become so widely accepted that it is <lb/>
generally regarded as a standard by the States, by FHWA, and by <lb/>
the courts. Surely this effort held a greater promise of achieving <lb/>
nationwide uniformity than a Federally imposed standard because it <lb/>
is authored by the State Highway Officials themselves and made a <lb/>
part of FHWA's accepted standards.</p>
<ornament type="characters">*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;</ornament>
<p>A quick review of the statistics will show the need for greater <lb/>
commitment by all of us to the problems of highway safety:</p>
<p><hi rend="underline">National Safety Council</hi> - 1972 - reported that of 56,600 <lb/>
fatalities, 19,000 involved roadside hazards or overturning.</p>
<p><hi rend="underline">FH</hi>W<hi rend="underline">A</hi> - 1968-1971 - reported that 51.8% of the fatalities on <lb/>
Interstates were single car runoffs; most involved fixed objects.</p>
<p><hi rend="underline">Pennsylvania DOT</hi> - 1972 - reported that 682 of 2085 fatalities <lb/>
were related to fixed objects.</p>
<p>The GAO, in reviewing FHWA's 1970 report, determined the following <lb/>
cost-effectiveness data:</p>
<list>
<label>1.</label><item><p>4.78 lives could be saved and 86.96 injuries avoided for each <lb/>
$1 million spent on highway safety improvement work.</p></item>
<label>2.</label><item><p>0.77 life could be saved and 19.33 injuries avoided for each <lb/>
$1 million spent on regular construction on the Interstates.</p></item>
<label>3.</label><item><p>1.1 lives could be saved and 38.85 injuries avoided for each <lb/>
$1 million spent on safety improvement work on primary, <lb/>
secondary and urban roads.</p></item>
</list>
<p>GAO's conclusion: Highway safety improvement work is about five <lb/>
times greater than regular construction work in lives saved, and <lb/>
three times greater in injuries avoided.</p>
<p>These figures indicate that the need is to improve existing <lb/>
roadways rather than to spend safety finds on new construction&mdash; <lb/>
but the sad fact is, according to GAO, that during the seven years <lb/>
following the 1966 Act, the States had spent only 2.1% of the Federal <lb/>
apportionment on safety projects.</p>
<ornament type="characters">*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;</ornament>
<p>In light of the statistics, let's look at the procedures under <lb/>
which the States obtain Federal-Aid and the sequence of their <reg orig="pro-|jects">projects</reg> <lb/>
for new construction:</p>

<p>The State Highway Departments are required to submit a program <lb/>
for FHWA approval to qualify for 50% (primary, secondary, urban <lb/>
roads) or 90% (Interstate) financial aid. Following program approval, <lb/>
the States proceed to:</p>
<list>
<label>1.</label><item><p>conduct public hearings on proposed location and submit a <lb/>
report of the hearings including effects on air, noise, and <lb/>
water quality fo FHWA for approval. (location; draft of EIS)</p></item>
<label>2.</label><item><p>prepare preliminary engineering programs and projects, (design)</p></item>
<label>3.</label><item><p>conduct public hearings on preliminary design and submit a <lb/>

<label>7.</label><item><p>final inspection (acceptance for compliance by FHWA)</p></item>
<label>8.</label><item><p>maintenance (and public use)</p></item>
</list>
<p>Once PS &amp; E approval has been granted, the Federal Government <lb/>
has a contractural obligation for payment (50% to 90%). Upon <reg orig="com-|pletion">completion</reg> <lb/>
the State has sole responsibility for maintenance and can <lb/>
initiate requests for safety improvement work in the future.</p>

<p>In 1973 an amendment to the Federal-Aid Act of 1916 permitted <lb/>
the Secretary of Transportation to issue a "Certification Acceptance" <lb/>
to the States on the condition that the State would perform its <lb/>
responsibilities in accordance with the laws and standards "at <lb/>
least equivalent" to those in Title 23. Because progress was so <lb/>
slow in the initiation of program requests by the States for safety <lb/>
improvements, Congress appropriated separate money (from Federal-Aid <lb/>
funds) for abatement of high-accident locations and removal of <reg orig="road-|side">roadside</reg> <lb/>

<p>Subsequent instructional memoranda were issued by the Federal <lb/>
Highway Administrator which specified that high speed design highways <lb/>
would be those where design speed is 50 MPH or more with ADT of 750 <lb/>
or more. Those design standards contained in the "Yellow Book" are <lb/>
accepted by the FHWA as supplements. (A separate list of AASHO <lb/>
standards and specifications will be furnished to you during the <lb/>
course for future reference.)</p>
<p>From time to time, FHWA issues additional standards which result <lb/>
from observation of conditions or programs of research and testing: <lb/>
<pb n="11" entity="z000000510_0029" pid="uva-lib:151479"><fw type="sig" place="top-right">L-3</fw></pb>
culverts and bridges over streams, for instance, are to be designed <lb/>
for 50-year frequency or the greatest flood of record with run-off <lb/>
based on expected development on the watershed over the next 20 years; <lb/>
inlets and pavement drainage are to be spaced so that nor more than <lb/>
&frac12; of a through traffic lane is flooded during a 10-year frequency <lb/>
storm, except that a 50-year frequency is used at depressed sections.</p>
<p>Experiments have been conducted for the use of crash cushions <lb/>
to absorb the impact of vehicles upon fixed objects. Three devices <lb/>
are currently acceptable and testing of other devices is continuing. <lb/>

<p>Apart from the Laws regarding pendent jurisdiction, negligence, <lb/>
sovereign immunity, liability, etc. which are too complex for me to <lb/>
understand, are the responsibilities laid down by the ASLA and the <lb/>
design standards laid down by FHWA as <hi rend="underline">minimum</hi> measures of the <reg orig="design-|er's">designer's</reg> <lb/>
performance. We must accept the duty to design in the <reg orig="expecta-|tion">expectation</reg> <lb/>
that accidents <hi rend="underline">will</hi> occur and that the recovery zone adjacent <lb/>
to the highway must be safe for vehicles leaving the paved sections.</p>
<p>Designers have been brought to court (will be in the future) for <lb/>
injuries suffered by motorists simply because our work effects the <lb/>
public health and safety. The accident rate on our highways can be <lb/>
improved by the judgment and competence of the designer. Our <reg orig="judg-|ments">judgments</reg> <lb/>
may be rejected for sound reasons, but we are obligated, <lb/>
nonetheless, to present the safest design within the state of the <lb/>
art and to raise our own level of competence constantly.</p>

<head rend="left">LECTURE <hi rend="underline">4</hi> - <hi rend="underline">CIRCULAR CURVES</hi></head>
<p>See <hi rend="underline">Seelye's</hi> pages 346-348 for Circular Curves and Functions of <lb/>
1&deg; Curve.</p>
<p>The Circular Curve is the basic geometry from which the spiral <lb/>
developed. Even though we use a spline for road alignment of <reg orig="ever-|changing">ever-changing</reg> <lb/>
curvature, it is the <hi rend="underline">circle</hi> from which we derive our geometry.</p>
<p>Circular curves have common properties regardless of scale; it <lb/>
is through convention that we have come to use symbols to describe <lb/>
their elements as we use abbreviations to describe the words of our <lb/>
language: i.e., vs, na, AM, USA, etc.</p>
<p>Let us start from a circle made up of 360 arcs, each arc being <lb/>
subtended by one degree, and each arc having a chord of 100 feet. <lb/>
The circumference of our circle, therefore, is 360 arcs times 100 <lb/>
feet equals 26,000 feet. Recall the equation for circumference:</p>
<q>
<p>C = 2 pi R</p>
<p>36,000 - 2 x 3.1415 x R</p>
<p>R = 5729.578&prime;</p>
</q>
<p>For convenience we say, "a one degree curve has a radius of <lb/>
5730 feet." Equations, then, are:</p>
<p>R = 5730/D OR D = 5730/R</p>
<p>Examples: Find the radius of a 5.12&deg; curve.</p>
<q>
<p>R = 5730 &divide; 5.12&deg;</p>
<p>R = 1120&prime;</p>
<p>and D = 5730 &divide; 1120&prime;</p>
<p>D - 5.12&deg;</p>
</q>
<p>The circle described has a radius of 1120&prime;; 100&prime; of arc is <lb/>
subtended by an angle of 5.12&deg;; the length of the curve is unknown.</p>
<p>The definition, then, for <hi rend="underline">degree of curvature</hi> is the angle <lb/>
subtended by one hundred feet of arc.</p>

<p>We use a steel tape to lay out curves which produces a series of <lb/>
100&prime; chords to locate the centerline. On long radius curves that <lb/>
field practice is acceptable; on short radius curves (say 1000&prime;) we <lb/>
use chords of 50&prime; and station the centerline accordingly. Remember <lb/>
that we are laying out an <hi rend="underline">arc</hi> of 100&prime; and that the <hi rend="underline">chord</hi> is a <lb/>
shorter distance. Use the equation c = 2R x sin d (where d is &frac14;D) <lb/>
for short radius curves.</p>
<p>The circle template you bought at Bailey's or Mint Printing will <lb/>
help you to locate the compass points from which to refine your <lb/>
broad pencil line. It will save time.</p>
<p>Recall our work at Pen Park when we laid out a circular curve <lb/>
using the transit and a hundred-foot tape. In that case we used a <lb/>
deflection angle equal to <hi rend="underline">half of the degree of curve;</hi> we then pulled <lb/>
a hundred-foot chord to intersect the line of sight. We could have <lb/>
set points at fifty-foot intervals by using <hi rend="underline">half of the deflection <lb/>
angles;</hi> or twenty-five-foot intervals by using a <hi rend="underline">quarter of the <lb/>
deflection angle.</hi></p>
<p>It is imperative that we understand deflection angles and that <lb/>
we be assured that the person on the instrument knows the procedure <lb/>
as well! (There is a scar in Big Bend a thousand feet long because <lb/>
I failed to understand deflections and assumed that the person on <lb/>
the transit did!)</p>
<p>You might study the procedure of <hi rend="underline">string lining</hi> to lay out field <lb/>
work; I use two tapes in the field to lay out arcs and tangents, as <lb/>
well as the tables of natural sines to lay out angles.</p>

<head rend="left"><hi rend="underline">SUPERELEVATION:</hi></head>
<p>Railroad engineers learned that rolling stock and track were <lb/>
subjected to greater lateral stresses at the beginnings and ends <lb/>
of curves in the rails (changes in direction). In order to prevent <lb/>
overturning, they adopted the practice of raising the outside rail <lb/>
and lowering the inside rail (superelevation). They learned, too, <lb/>
that the ride could be made smoother and the stress on rolling <lb/>
stock could be reduced if horizontal curves followed <hi rend="underline">gradual</hi> <lb/>
changes (transitions) rather than abrupt changes (circular curves). <lb/>
The engineers formulated tables combining the physical principles <lb/>
of superelevation and spirals.</p>
<p>With the introduction of the automobile, the engineers used the <lb/>
tables they had developed for railroads to lay out auto roads. Many <lb/>
inserted superelevation into the tangent but omitted the spiral in <lb/>
the belief that automobiles could make transitions within the travel <lb/>
lane. Accidents on the highways increased where the transition <lb/>
curves were omitted. <hi rend="underline">Joseph Barnett,</hi> an outstanding engineer in <lb/>
Public Roads Administration, argued for transition curves with <reg orig="super-|elevation">superelevation</reg> <lb/>
in order to improve safety and to provide a smoother ride <lb/>
along a graceful curve. (He had gained experience earlier in the <lb/>
<pb n="3" entity="z000000510_0043" pid="uva-lib:151501"><fw type="sig" place="top-right">L-5</fw></pb>
design of parkways in Westchester County with Clarke and Downer.)</p>
<p>Barnett studied the behavior of drivers as they were affected <lb/>
by superelevation and friction. He learned that drivers did <hi rend="underline">not</hi> <lb/>
adjust their speed to the importance of the road, but to the physical <lb/>
limitations of curvature, grade, sight distance, and smoothness of <lb/>
surface. He found that longer transitions were necessary at higher <lb/>
speeds to encourage drivers to stay in their occupied lane rather <lb/>
than encroaching on the adjoining lane.</p>
<p>Barnett learned, too, that vehicles traveling around a curve at <lb/>
low speed tended to slide down the superelevated incline when <reg orig="cen-|trifugal">centrifugal</reg> <lb/>
force was reduced. An analysis of 900 driving tests showed <lb/>
that resistance to transverse sliding was developed around a curve <lb/>
at friction coefficients of <hi rend="underline">0.16</hi> for speeds of 30 to 60 MPH, or <lb/>
<hi rend="underline">0.14</hi> for speeds of 70 MPH. <hi rend="underline">and</hi> that the limiting factor for ice was <lb/>
10%, or about 1&frac14; inches per foot.</p>
<p>From these findings, Barnett applied the coefficients of <reg orig="super-|elevation">superelevation</reg> <lb/>
and friction to the equation for <hi rend="underline">Equilibrium:</hi> the <reg orig="centri-|fugal">centrifugal</reg> <lb/>
force of a vehicle traveling around a curve of constant radius <lb/>
at a constant velocity is equal to the superelevation <hi rend="underline">S</hi> plus side <lb/>
friction <hi rend="underline">F,</hi> i.e. the vehicle is not skidding.</p>
<p>Let us examine the equation for <hi rend="underline">centrifugal force</hi> which is <lb/>
represented by Wv<hi rend="super">2</hi>/gR, where <hi rend="underline">W</hi> is the weight of the vehicle, <hi rend="underline">v</hi> is the <lb/>
velocity in feet per second, <hi rend="underline">g</hi> is the acceleration of gravity in <lb/>
feet per second, and <hi rend="underline">R</hi> is the radius of the curve in feet:</p>
<q>
<p>Wv<hi rend="super">2</hi>/gR = WS + WF (Barnett's equation)</p>
</q>
<p>Eliminate W, change v in feet per second to V in miles per hour, and <lb/>
substitute 32.16 for g.</p>
<q>
<p>Then: v = 5280 feet per mile/3600 seconds per hour = 1.467 ft. per sec. at <hi rend="underline">1</hi> MPH</p>
<p>Then: (1.467&prime;/sec.V)<hi rend="super">2</hi>/(32.16&prime;/sec.)R = 2.152 x V<hi rend="super">2</hi>/32.16 R = 0.067 x V<hi rend="super">2</hi>/R</p>
<p>Where <hi rend="underline">V</hi> is miles per hour and <hi rend="underline">R</hi> is radius of curve.</p>
<p>Superelevation <hi rend="underline">S</hi> + friction <hi rend="underline">F</hi> = 0.10 + 0.16 = 0.26</p>
<p>Equilibrium is 0.067 x V<hi rend="super">2</hi>/R = 0.26</p>
<pb n="4" entity="z000000510_0044" pid="uva-lib:151502"><fw type="sig" place="top-right">L-5</fw></pb>
<p>Then: R = 0.067 x V<hi rend="super">2</hi>/0.26 = 0.258 x V<hi rend="super">2</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="underline">Therefore: Minimum safe R</hi> = <hi rend="underline">0.258 x V<hi rend="super">2</hi></hi></p>
<p>For speeds of 30 MPH, minimum radius R is 232 feet (24.7&deg; curve)</p>
<p>For speeds of 40 MPH, minimum radius R is 412 feet (13.9&deg; curve)</p>
<p>For speeds of 50 MPH, minimum radius R is 644 feet (8.9&deg; curve)</p>
<p>For speeds of 60 MPH, minimum radius R is 928 feet (6.2&deg; curve)</p>
<p>For 70 MPH speed, use F = 0.14.</p>
<p>Then: S + F = 0.24 = 0.067 x V<hi rend="super">2</hi>/R</p>
<p>Therefore: Minimum radius at 70 MPH is 1,370 feet (41&deg; curve)</p>
</q>
<p>Barnett proposed that the <hi rend="underline">maximum</hi> superelevation practical for <lb/>
all but the sharpest curves should be 39% according to the following:</p>
<q>
<p>Effective superelevation = 0.10/0.10 + 0.16 = 0.39</p>
</q>
<p>This would result in all but the flattest curves being <reg orig="super-|elevated">superelevated</reg> <lb/>
to 10%; therefore, Barnett argued, superelevation should <lb/>
account for 75% of the design speed. For example, curves on a <reg orig="high-|way">highway</reg> <lb/>
with an assumed design speed of 60 MPH would be superelevated <lb/>
to compensate for the centrifugal force developed at 45 MPH. Barnett <lb/>
developed his tables for superelevation accordingly.</p>

<div3 type="subsection" id="d19">
<head rend="left"><hi rend="underline">DRIVER BEHAVIOR:</hi></head>
<p>Imagine yourself approaching a circular curve (without <reg orig="transi-|tion)">transition)</reg> <lb/>
at 40 MPH; you slow down to stay within your lane or, if the <lb/>
road is clear ahead, you encroach on the adjoining lane to maintain <lb/>
speed. In either case you have selected a transition course to <lb/>
travel around the curve. If you encroached on the adjoining lane, <lb/>
you created a traffic hazard to yourself and to others.</p>
<p>Suppose, too, that the curve was superelevated and you drove <lb/>
comfortably around the curve without skidding and increased your <lb/>
speed where the road straightened out again. Had the curve <hi rend="underline">not</hi> been <lb/>
superelevated, you would have slowed down around the curve to <hi rend="underline">avoid <lb/>
skidding.</hi> You experienced the conditions Barnett intended to improve <lb/>
to make roads safer.</p>
<p>In order to persuade engineers to design for transitions with <lb/>
superelevation, he developed tables to simplify calculations and <lb/>
<pb n="5" entity="z000000510_0045" pid="uva-lib:151503"><fw type="sig" place="top-right">L-5</fw></pb>
reduce engineering costs. The tables were published in Barnett's <lb/>
book, <hi rend="underline">Transition Curves for Highways.</hi></p>
<p>Because Barnett's tables resulted in <hi rend="underline">minus</hi> superelevation for <lb/>
curves flatter than 22&deg; at 25 MPH, and 4.5&deg; at 55 MPH, AASHO chose <lb/>
to use the equation found in <hi rend="underline">Seelye's:</hi></p>
<q>
<p>S = 0.067 x V<hi rend="super">2</hi> <hi rend="underline">minus</hi> F, where F = 0.16 and 0.14.</p>
</q>
<p>You will find that Virginia Highways uses standard normal crown <lb/>
and <hi rend="underline">0.0</hi> superelevation for curves flatter than 22&deg; at 25 MPH, and <lb/>
flatter than 4&deg; at 55 MPH.</p>

<head rend="left">LECTURE <hi rend="underline">6</hi> - <hi rend="underline">TRANSITION CURVES</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="underline">Joseph Barnett</hi> is one of my great heroes who, with <hi rend="underline">Frederick W. <lb/>
Cron,</hi> argued for roads of graceful curvature and the preservation <lb/>
of natural features within the road corridor. They were advocates <lb/>
for road spirals.</p>
<p>We think of Transition Curves as having three components:.</p>
<list>
<label>1.</label><item><p>The spiral from tangent to circular curve.</p></item>
<label>2.</label><item><p>The circular curve</p></item>
<label>3.</label><item><p>The spiral from circular curve to tangent</p></item>
</list>
<p>If we examine the shell of the Nautilus, we find in it the <lb/>
epitome of the spiral. That quality of everchanging curvature <reg orig="elim-|inates">eliminates</reg> <lb/>
abrupt changes in alignment and in the rhythm of movement <lb/>
over the landscape.</p>
<p>Joseph Barnett labored over a convenient method to persuade <lb/>
designers to use Transition Curves rather than Circular Curves. <lb/>
The time he devoted to the mathematical tables published in his <lb/>
book <hi rend="underline">Transition Curves for Highways</hi> must have been endless! A man <lb/>
blessed with patience and dedication to improving the beauty and <lb/>
safety of highways. (Recall the discussion of physics of a moving <lb/>
automobile in the lecture on Superelevation.)</p>
<p>The availability of the computer makes Barnett's task easier <lb/>
today. The tedious calculations are things of the past so long as <lb/>
we are in an office; engineering costs are reduced and the results <lb/>
are more quickly available.</p>
<p>THE CONCENTRIC CIRCLE TEMPLATE:</p>
<p>The <hi rend="underline">template with concentric circles</hi> which you bought from <lb/>
Bailey's or Mint Printing is one I developed out of a need to convert <lb/>
a 314 pencil line to geometrics. It saves time and has been <reg orig="re-|produced">reproduced</reg> <lb/>
many times in the Park Service. Within the Division of <lb/>
Landscape Architecture we have a set of <hi rend="underline">Highway Curves</hi> for drafting <lb/>
arcs of greater radius than we can draw with the compass. We'll <lb/>
practice with those during the weeks ahead. My greatest concern is <lb/>
that you master the geometrics so that you can draw road centerlines <lb/>
with a straight-edge, a compass, and a spiral curve template. Again, <lb/>
it's what you need to know.</p>

<p>My purpose in spending so many hours in developing a method <lb/>
for you to use in calculating Transition Curves with a pocket <reg orig="cal-|culator">calculator</reg> <lb/>
is that you will be more effective in the field. If you <lb/>
will remember what we did together in Surveying and in Park Roads, <lb/>
you will be able to lay-out roads and hold your own.</p>
<p>Within the capabilities of Barnett's Tables, and Howland's <lb/>
Fourteen Steps, you can indeed refine the Transition Curve where <lb/>
the spiral of one curve will join the adjacent spiral at the same <lb/>
point:</p>
<q>
<p>S.T.<hi rend="sub">1</hi> = T.S.<hi rend="sub">2</hi></p>

<p>Furthermore, you can eliminate the circular curve altogether:</p>

<p>Dick Montgomery, Chief Engineer and Ol' Ben, Chief Landscape <lb/>
Architect, agreed that our procedure should require the Landscape <lb/>
Architects to draw the preliminary road centerline. Drawings were <lb/>
to show tangents connecting the P.I.s, the compass points for each <lb/>
curve, the tangent points perpendicular to the compass points, and <lb/>
the radius of the curve shown concentric to the centerline. The <lb/>
purposes of our agreement were to communicate to the Design Engineer <lb/>
the controls implied in the location of the centerline, and to <reg orig="over-|come">overcome</reg> <lb/>
the time-loss in Landscape Architects doing tedious calculations <lb/>
that Engineers could do faster. Once the drawing was approved by <lb/>
the Chiefs, the teams worked through the construction drawings and <lb/>
put the specs together. It worked. The team approach was and IS <lb/>
the secret to success enjoyed by the NPS.</p>

<head rend="left"><hi rend="underline">THE SPLINE LINE:</hi></head>
<p>You will be manipulating transitions during the design of your <lb/>
road at Birdwood or your project next Fall. While you are refining <lb/>
"Your Road", ask what might be the next refinement in striving for <lb/>
the <hi rend="underline">perfect</hi> line of grace and movement. What mathematical <reg orig="deriva-|tion">derivation</reg> <lb/>

might lead to the absence of tangents altogether? And what <lb/>
might we call that line?</p>
<p>Let me share an experience with you:</p>
<p>Soon after I was called into the office from the Tree Gang in <lb/>
1951, I was amazed to see a "spline and set of spline weights." <lb/>
As students, we had not seen those tools much less used them during <lb/>
our time in school. I was fascinated by the skill with which Mr. <lb/>
VanGelder and Mr. Hanson adjusted the direction and subtle refinements <lb/>
of road centerlines. This was the magic of everchanging curvature <lb/>
that Prof. Albrect had described to us. To my disappointment, I <lb/>
neither acquired the skill that Mr. VanGelder and Mr. Hanson had <lb/>
nor was my curiosity satisfied in the potential of the "spline <lb/>
line." Very soon I found myself drawing road alignment for the <lb/>
Bureau Engineers in terms of tangents and circular curves onto <lb/>
which they imposed their mysteries to convert my crude line to <lb/>
geometrics. The fascination for the "spline line" continued through <lb/>
the years and to this day I want to master that highest of park <lb/>
road geometrics, "The Line Without Tangents."</p>
<p>I don't know the procedure for calculating the "spline line"; <lb/>
although Nick Annese shows me that Clarke and Rapuano uses the <lb/>
method as standard procedure. Perhaps Ol' Ben could learn from <lb/>
those designers who use it.</p>
<p>In this day of computers the calculations could be done quickly. <lb/>
Programming the computer is quite another matter...and I lack the <lb/>
skill to do that. To those of you who are interested and possess <lb/>
the skills in programming, I would encourage you to explore the <lb/>
geometrics of the "spline line". Surely the spline line geometrics <lb/>
will lead to a refinement of the methods I have presented to you <lb/>
in this course.</p>

<div3 type="subsection" id="d25">
<head rend="left"><hi rend="underline">Discussion:</hi></head>
<p>Horizontal and vertical alignment are directly related and are <lb/>
therefore designed as a ribbon having three dimensions. Horizontal <lb/>
curves are contained within a single vertical curve to insure <reg orig="uni-|formity">uniformity</reg> <lb/>
of centrifugal force and friction. Vertical curves are also <lb/>
a function of sight distance, gradient and headlight distance. Hans <lb/>
Lorenz, an engineer experienced in design of German autobahns, <lb/>
suggests a rule that the vertex of the horizontal curve should <reg orig="coin-|cide">coincide</reg> <lb/>
with the vertex of the vertical curve to avoid a rollercoaster <lb/>
effect within a horizontal curve. F. W. Cron, an engineer of the <lb/>
Bureau, points out that "most of the awkwardness of the highway <lb/>
arises from failure to visualize the road in three dimensons during <lb/>
the planning stage." Mr. Cron spent much of his career working <lb/>
with us in the National Park Service.</p>
<p>Short vertical curves are to be avoided in any case even though <lb/>
the vertex of the vertical coincides with the vertex of the horizontal <lb/>
curve. Vertical curves often make up 50% of the profile and may be <lb/>
greater on gentle topography. In the design of park roads, we strive <lb/>
to make the appearance of the road forward as aesthetically pleasing <lb/>
as geometry will permit. This criteria is made more difficult by <lb/>
the requirement that cuts and fills be kept to an absolute minimum.</p>
<p>Virginia Highway's tables for minimum sight distance on vertical <lb/>
curves show curves as short as 50 feet and as long as 2000 feet. <lb/>
New York State requires a minimum sight distance of 1000 feet on <lb/>
its Thruway. (Tunnard, page 193) My own opinion is that vertical <lb/>
curves should not be shorter than 250 feet which is about the minimum <lb/>
radius of a horizontal curve at 30 MPH (232 feet). The alternative <lb/>
to shorter vertical curves is an elevated structure on sag curves; <lb/>
summit curves are less difficult, usually, because landforms tend <lb/>
to be rounded on convex slopes and sharper in valleys. Park roads <lb/>
are by nature of low speed, and therefore sight distances are much <lb/>
shorter than on high speed roadways. It is, after all, a principle <lb/>
of controlling the speed at which drivers will travel the roadway <lb/>
that park roads are built.</p>

<head rend="left">LECTURE <hi rend="underline">8</hi> - <hi rend="underline">DRAINAGE</hi></head>
<p>An Engineer in the Park Service used to say, "... remember three <lb/>
things about roads: the first is <hi rend="underline">drainage,</hi> the second is <hi rend="underline">drainage,</hi> <lb/>
and the third is <hi rend="underline">drainage</hi>!"</p>
<p>Road construction requires that runoff be intercepted in roadside <lb/>
ditches before the water that falls onto the watershed reaches the <lb/>
road prism. It is imperative that drainage be provided to prevent <lb/>
ice forming in the roadbed and prevent soft spots from developing <lb/>
under the road surface.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that ditches placed in most soils will erode at <lb/>
gradients steeper than two percent; therefore, a series of drop <lb/>
inlets is necessary along the ditchline at intervals not greater than <lb/>
300 feet. Ditches on steep grades are sometimes paved with asphalt <lb/>
or concrete to prevent scouring; rock lining is used to reduce <reg orig="velo-|city">velocity</reg> <lb/>
of flow. Woven fabric is sometimes used in swales to encourage <lb/>
the growth of turf.</p>
<p>One of the chief reasons for erosion of ditches and subsequent <lb/>
sloughing of the slopes is the practice of shaping the ditch with <lb/>
the blade of a patrol grader. The blacksmith at Yellowstone <reg orig="fash-|ioned">fashioned</reg> <lb/>
a shoe made from steel plate which is attached to the blade <lb/>
end; the form of the shoe produces a rounded ditch which is <reg orig="aesthe-|tically">aesthetically</reg> <lb/>
superior and more stable than the V-ditch.</p>
<p>We will review the Rational Formula which you learned in your <lb/>
Grading course, and then Manning's Formula for the design of ditches.</p>
<p>Should the ditchline be a swale? a V-shaped channel? a rock <lb/>
lined gutter? a rounded turf swale? Although the formulas dictate <lb/>
the volumes of water to be accounted for, it is the immediate <lb/>
setting that determines the kind of ditch you will build.</p>
<p>Subsurface drainage systems can be quite complex in areas where <lb/>
the groundwater is close to the surface, or where adjacent soils <lb/>
are subject to saturation and freezing and thawing in the Springtime. <lb/>
The following details are taken from the Virginia Highway's book, <lb/>
<hi rend="underline">Road Design and Standards:</hi></p>

<p>Drainage Structures are critical visual elements deserving <lb/>
special design consideration where the structures are obvious to <lb/>
the visitor. Standard details are minimums: we notice the ends <lb/>
of culverts, the faces of drop inlets, the ends of bridge scuppers. <lb/>
Design decisions are needed wherever drainage structures are <reg orig="con-|spicuous">conspicuous</reg>: <lb/>
is design needed? is design not needed?</p>
<div3 type="subsection" id="d27">
<head rend="left"><hi rend="underline">DIVERSION DITCHES:</hi></head>
<p>Diversion ditches are frequently built above the cut face of <lb/>
the slope to intercept surface water. The gradient of the diversion <lb/>
ditch, being steeper than the roadside ditch requires a velocity <lb/>
check before it joins the roadside ditchline or culvert. See the <lb/>
case at Michie Tavern where paved ditches are joined at the toe of <lb/>
slope; the need for a velocity check structure is obvious.</p>
<p>In situations where the centerline of the road is level, it is <lb/>
necessary to draw a profile of the ditchline to insure flow of <lb/>
water. Constitution Avenue in the District of Columbia is level; <lb/>
the gutters are undulating with highpoints placed between drop <lb/>
inlets. In developed areas water is collected in gutters rather <lb/>
than ditchlines; therefore, the drop inlets and underground pipe <lb/>
systems are designed as closed systems. Recall the exercise you <lb/>
did in Grading for a closed system.</p>
</div3>
<div3 type="subsection" id="d28">
<head rend="left"><hi rend="underline">CULVERTS:</hi></head>
<p>Early culverts called "pole drains" were probably nothing more <lb/>
than poles laid in stream beds; these were simply voids under the <lb/>
fill. Timber and masonry structures were developed to an art in <lb/>
the construction of canals before Portland cement became a common <lb/>
material. One of the culverts on the C and O Canal has a rifled <lb/>
liner designed to increase velocity thereby reducing the area of <lb/>
the opening to accommodate the volume of water reaching the culvert. <lb/>
In some parts of the storm water system in the District of Columbia <lb/>
we find pipes fabricated from wood staves bound by metal hoops. <lb/>
Brick was extensively used for storm sewers and drop inlets. It <lb/>
was not until the development of corrugated metal pipe that <reg orig="cul-|verts">culverts</reg> <lb/>
could be made cheaply; from the various shapes and sizes <lb/>
available we can select the pipe which satisfies the flow <reg orig="re-|quirements">requirements</reg>. <lb/>
<pb n="5" entity="z000000510_0078" pid="uva-lib:151562"><fw type="sig" place="top-right">L-8</fw></pb>
Concrete pipe has several advantages: the friction <lb/>
coefficient is lower, the crushing strength is greater, and its <lb/>
service life is longer than metal pipe. Terra cotta pipe is still <lb/>
used where acid is prevalent in waste water. Cast iron is used <lb/>
where heavy loads must be accommodated.</p>
<p>Culvert size is a function of volume, roughness and slope. Our <lb/>
primary interest is in the soil surfaces at the ends of the pipe <lb/>
where appearance is especially troublesome. Conspicuous culvert <lb/>
openings may require masonry or concrete headwalls; outfalls may <lb/>
require special velocity checks or provisions to spread the water <lb/>
over a paved apron.</p>
</div3>
<div3 type="subsection" id="d29">
<head rend="left"><hi rend="underline">BOX CULVERTS:</hi></head>
<p>Box culverts built of timber or concrete are designed to carry <lb/>
loads on a slab placed over parallel walls; water is spread over <lb/>
a broader surface than with round pipe. Box culverts over 20 feet <lb/>
wide are classified as bridges and are therefore regarded as major <lb/>
structures. These are often provided to connect cattle pastures <lb/>
and to provide routes for wildlife to move from one habitat to <lb/>
another. Bridges usually cause a lesser impact on the land than the <lb/>
fills associated with box culverts. Multi-box and multi-arch <reg orig="cul-|verts">culverts</reg> <lb/>
are used to reduce the depth of fills necessary to <reg orig="accommo-|date">accommodate</reg> <lb/>
larger single pipe sizes.</p>
</div3>
<div3 type="subsection" id="d30">
<head rend="left"><hi rend="underline">CAUSEWAYS:</hi></head>
<p>Causeways are bridges in effect; the roadway is supported either <lb/>
on a long earth fill over a series of culverts or on a timber or <lb/>
concrete slab resting on piling. Earthen causeways are <reg orig="inappro-|priate">inappropriate</reg> <lb/>
in tidal areas and marshes where the ebb of water is critical <lb/>
to the quality of aquatic habitat. Causeways make up most of the <lb/>
Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel and are used to carry roadways across <lb/>
Lake Pontchartrain and to connect the Florida Keys. The structures <lb/>
provide a beneficial reef effect for fish populations; adversely, <lb/>
they impose a narrowing of navigation channels. I do prefer pilings <lb/>
to earthen causeways.</p>

Feasibility studies are conducted by highway agencies based <lb/>

<p>The landscape architect starts the project with the study of <lb/>

In some cases, topo maps at larger scale are available. The U. S. <lb/>
Forest Service and Soil Conservation Service use maps and aerial <lb/>
photos at a scale of l&Prime; = 660&prime; or 80 chains to a mile. Several <lb/>
routes may be studied on paper using a 314 pencil to determine the <lb/>
economy of construction in terms of excavation. In park road design <lb/>
where preservation takes precedent over economy, a corridor is <lb/>

<head rend="left">LECTURE 11- <hi rend="underline">SLOPES</hi></head>
<p>Consider the elements which make up the cross-section of a <reg orig="road-|way">roadway</reg>: <lb/>
the cut-slope extends from the feather edge above the <reg orig="excava-|tion">excavation</reg> <lb/>
downward to the ditchline; the fill-slope extends from the <lb/>
shoulder edge downward to the feather edge of the embankment; other <lb/>
elements are ditches, shoulders, and pavement. Slopes take up most <lb/>
of the road prism; they are the transitions from the ditches and <lb/>
shoulders to the limits of grading. The appearance of the roadside <lb/>
and the views to distant features beyond the roadway are largely <lb/>
the result of the landscape architect's skills in drawing the grading <lb/>
plan.</p>
<p>Construction manuals show standard sections with slopes of 1:1 <lb/>
or 2:1 as though the slopes are mathematic conveniences for estimating <lb/>
earthwork. In my observations there are no standard slope ratios to <lb/>
fit all soil conditions along the roadway. Look for the steepest <lb/>
natural slope in the adjacent area; that slope ratio is stable for <lb/>
similar soils in that segment of the roadway. If we use a slope <lb/>
steeper than the angle of repose, we will be cleaning ditches from <lb/>
now on!</p>
<p>Observe the cut-slopes in the Piedmont of Virginia; 2:1 slopes <lb/>
are unstable because of the high clay content. Slopes of 3:1 or <lb/>
flatter are more stable.</p>
<p>It is essential that we show <hi rend="underline">on the drawings</hi> the material to be <lb/>
encountered in the excavation; therefore, study the soil maps and the <lb/>
boring charts before you begin a grading plan. And go to the field <lb/>
to find indicators of changes in soils! Rock outcrops, rock strata <lb/>
in streambeds, sediments deposited at grade-breaks won't show on <lb/>
topo drawings.</p>
<p>Bidders will increase their bid prices for unclassified <reg orig="excava-|tion">excavation</reg> <lb/>
to play it safe. Estimators will allow for rock excavation <lb/>
because it requires blasting. Therefore, your bid prices will be <lb/>
more realistic if you show the slope ratio for given soil types <lb/>
according to the conditions you expect to encounter. Field <reg orig="in-|spection">inspection</reg> <lb/>
will show the stable slope of shale or decomposed granite <lb/>
more accurately than the standard slope ratio shown in the <reg orig="con-|struction">construction</reg> <lb/>
manual.</p>

<head rend="left"><hi rend="underline">Howland's Theory:</hi></head>
<p>I have a theory to share with you. It is that a slope resembling <lb/>
a natural curve is more stable than an artificial curve. If we <lb/>
determine the angle of repose for a particular soil, a <hi rend="underline">Catenary <lb/>
Curve</hi> taken from the midpoint of the slope downward through the <lb/>
ditchline to the shoulder will be stable. If the same curve is <lb/>
reversed and extended upward to the feather edge of the cut-slope, <lb/>
the face of the slope will then be in equilibrium. That convex/ <lb/>
concave slope is what we see in the landscape. If we accept the <lb/>
definition that the angle of repose is that gradient at which a <lb/>
particular soil will stand when fully saturated, the slope will <lb/>
then be in equilibrium. I intend to test the theory to prove its <lb/>
logic and will tell you the results later.</p>
<p>Therefore, slopes are transitions in elevation. A drop of <lb/>
rainwater falling at the crest of a convex slope will increase in <lb/>
velocity as steepness increases. If the lower slope is made concave, <lb/>
the acceleration will be reduced until the drop of rainwater arrives <lb/>
at the ditchline.</p>
</div3>
<div3 type="subsection" id="d55">
<head rend="left"><hi rend="underline">The Seedbed:</hi></head>
<p>Road slopes are a giant seedbed beyond the pavement on which <lb/>
seeds will germinate under conditions of sunlight, moisture and <lb/>
sufficient nutrients to support growth.</p>
<p>Moisture which reaches the root systems of plants is in part a <lb/>
function of steepness. The steeper the slope and the smoother the <lb/>
texture of the soil surface, the faster will be the rate of runoff. <lb/>
Runoff will penetrate the soil surface over a longer time period <lb/>
on flatter slopes because the rate of acceleration is lower. We <lb/>
know that snowpack will be retained longer on north and east facing <lb/>
slopes than on south and west facing slopes. Therefore, the former <lb/>
will be wetter longer.</p>
<p>We know, too, that moisture is a factor in the success of <lb/>
volunteer species which will occupy a slope; and that dry site <lb/>
species will occupy the upper slopes and that wet site species will <lb/>
occupy the lower slopes. In the Yellowstone we find that lodgepole <lb/>
pine germinates quickly on slopes exposed to sunlight, and that fir <lb/>
<pb n="3" entity="z000000510_0094" pid="uva-lib:151584"><fw type="sig" place="top-right">L-11</fw></pb>
and spruce will germinate on duff covered, moist shaded slopes. <lb/>
The succession of species following forest fires is the same.</p>
</div3>
<div3 type="subsection" id="d56">
<head rend="left"><hi rend="underline">CLIMATIC FACTORS:</hi></head>
<p>Exposure to wind, sun and extremes of temperature will affect <lb/>
available moisture for plant growth. Seed retention and ultimate <lb/>
germination will depend on the roughness of the slope where slight <lb/>
cracks and crevices provide harbors for the seed. Mulch will shelter <lb/>
the seed from the sun's heat, and also will absorb the impact of <lb/>
rain from dislodging the seed.</p>
<p>The practice of hydroseeding promotes the growth of turf on <lb/>
slopes, especially in situations where equipment and planting <lb/>
crews are impractical. Hydroseeders are capable of spreading <reg orig="mix-|tures">mixtures</reg> <lb/>
of seed, fertilizers, and mulch simultaneously. Be especially <lb/>
cautious in the fall of the year...Seed the slopes (the seedbed) <lb/>
before the ground freezes. Root growth will occur over the winter, <lb/>
and the degree of erosion will be reduced.</p>
<p>Remember that the lighter colored mulches will reflect the sun's <lb/>
heat while darker colored mulches will absorb heat. Deep mulches <lb/>
(three to four inches) will insulate the soil against freezing and <lb/>
thawing better than will thin mulches (one to two inches). Frost <lb/>
heave results from alternate freezing and thawing. Voids created <lb/>
by frost heave cause roots of plants to wither and die. The choice <lb/>
of mulch materials is important, in that the process of decomposition <lb/>
extracts nitrogen from the soil. Inorganic mulches (asphalt or <lb/>
fiberglass) will not deplete soil nitrogen needed for plant growth.</p>

<head rend="left"><hi rend="underline">Maintenance:</hi></head>
<p>You will be asked for recommendations for the maintenance of <lb/>
road slopes. Please remember that slopes steeper than 2:1 are <lb/>
hazardous to equipment operators, and that wet ditches cause tractor <lb/>
wheels to sink. Designate areas to be mowed to grass heights of <lb/>
four inches to reduce browning-off during the summer droughts and <lb/>
set aside areas as seedbeds for wildflowers...these to be mowed <lb/>
after the seeds drop in late summer.</p>

<p>Vista clearing is a designed operation, not "eye-balling" as <lb/>
some folks accuse us of practicing. First, decide on what features <lb/>
you want to interpret along the roadway (the nature of the mature <lb/>
forest, for instance) and then decide on those features which will <lb/>
enhance the scenic quality beyond the roadway (the snowpeaks of a <lb/>
mountain range, for example). Prepare a plan showing the locations <lb/>
of these "openings" along the roadway. Flag those dominant trees <lb/>
to be removed. Step back to the motorists' travel path to study <lb/>
the trees selected. Consider the effects of the scene, the <reg orig="conse-|quence">consequence</reg> <lb/>
of removal on the remaining vegetation. Make the final <lb/>
decision based on your best aesthetic judgment and your knowledge <lb/>
of silviculture. Vista clearing is a combination of the two arts: <lb/>
aesthetics and silviculture.</p>

<head rend="left"><hi rend="underline">Running the job:</hi></head>
<p>Working over a slope, especially a wet slope, is sometimes <lb/>
hazardous and sometimes damaging to the slope itself. Removing <lb/>
deadfalls and loose rock can leave scars, and a fall or a slip of <lb/>
the foot can cause an injury. Use ropes and gloves when working <lb/>
on steep slopes... and never work alone!</p>
<p>Be especially careful with handtools and instruct new workmen <lb/>
in the use of saws, axes, and pulaskies. Gloves, goggles, chaps, <lb/>
stout shoes, and hard hats are essential.</p>
<p>Controlling traffic along the roadway is necessary to reduce <lb/>
accidents. Warning signs must be posted at least 500 feet in <lb/>
advance of the work site so that motorists can slow down, and flagmen <lb/>
must be stationed to control cars approaching the work site. Safety <lb/>
for both work crews and motorists is part of the job!</p>

<head rend="left">LECTURE <hi rend="underline">12</hi> - <hi rend="underline">PAVEMENTS</hi></head>
<p>(See Seelye, pages 343 to 345, 370 to 382; <hi rend="underline">Thickness Design,</hi> <lb/>
The Asphalt Institute, College Park, MD; <hi rend="underline">Interim Guide for Design <lb/>
of Pavement Structures,</hi> AASHTO, Washington, D.C.)</p>
<p>Pavements are flexible (bituminous) or rigid (reinforced <reg orig="con-|crete)">concrete)</reg>. <lb/>
Each has its attributes.</p>
<p>Concrete has the advantage of acting as a rigid slab which <reg orig="dis-|tributes">distributes</reg> <lb/>
the load over a wider surface area on the subgrade. Because <lb/>
the structure is rigid, the wheel loads are supported over the <reg orig="occa-|sional">occasional</reg> <lb/>
voids and soft spots that develop in the subgrade; the slab <lb/>
acts like a bridge spanning the underlying voids.</p>
<p>Concrete pavements can be built to closer tolerances than <lb/>
asphalt (bituminous) pavements because the formwork which contains <lb/>
the plastic concrete can be accurately installed before the material <lb/>
is poured. Also, the mixture is easier to control in terms of <lb/>
hardness, strength, curing, and testing.</p>
<p>Concrete is by definition a mixture of aggregates, cement and <lb/>
water which in the process of hydration forms a rigid mass of high <lb/>
compressive strength. It is the property of concrete to be "<reg orig="incom-|pressible">incompressible</reg>" <lb/>
that makes it a valuable construction material; <reg orig="further-|more">furthermore</reg>, <lb/>
concrete has a very low coefficient of expansion which <lb/>
provides structural stability. The problem with concrete is that it <lb/>
has a very low tensile strength: steel rods, which have a very <lb/>
high tensile strength are implaced in the concrete mixture to <reg orig="pro-|vide">provide</reg> <lb/>
that property. Expansion joints are designed into concrete <lb/>
structures to control cracks that result from tensile weakness; <lb/>
otherwise, random cracks would occur as the heated slab cools and <lb/>
contracts.</p>
<p>The selection of aggregate contributes to hardness, color, and <lb/>
durability. Crushed granite, for example, will produce harder <reg orig="con-|crete">concrete</reg> <lb/>
than crushed gravel composed of sandstone. The angularity <lb/>
and distribution of particle sizes are factors of hardness; angular <lb/>
particles (crushed stone) have a greater mechanical strength than do <lb/>
rounded particles (gravels). Particles of uniform size are separated <lb/>
by uniform size voids; graduated sizes are introduced to fill the <lb/>
voids. Cement is the binder that locks the particles into a mass.</p>
<pb n="2" entity="z000000510_0102" pid="uva-lib:151597"><fw type="sig" place="top-right">L-12</fw></pb>
<p>We are finding that calcium chloride applied to melt ice causes <lb/>
a rapid deterioration of concrete due to the oxidation of the <reg orig="rein-|forcing">reinforcing</reg> <lb/>
steel within the road slab. The concrete itself appears <lb/>
to slough, the aggregates break apart, and the steel is finally <lb/>
exposed. According to concrete people whose opinions I respect, <lb/>
it seems that in the process of oxidation (rusting), the metal <lb/>
expands to ten times its original volume. As rusting occurs, the <lb/>
concrete, having a low tensile strength, is slowly "exploded" away <lb/>
from the steel. The external crumbling is the symptom of the <lb/>
interior process taking place in the slab.</p>
<p>The bridge decks you have seen being replaced on the George <lb/>
Washington Memorial Parkway at Dead Run and Spout Run failed because <lb/>
of this oxidation process. To prevent the recurrence of the problem <lb/>
an apparatus was to have been installed which causes a low electrical <lb/>
current to pass through the reinforcing steel thereby stopping the <lb/>
oxidation process. The bridge engineers of the FHWA described a <lb/>
technique tested by the Germans wherein the slab was impregnated <lb/>
with hot asphalt under pressure in order to seal the concrete against <lb/>
moisture. I know nothing more about it.</p>
<p>The concrete road slabs are "tied" across the expansion joints <lb/>
by steel dowels to overcome the tendency of one slab to rise above <lb/>
the other. Half of the dowel is covered with a sleeve to allow <lb/>
for expansion between the slabs; the joint is filled with an <reg orig="asphalt-|impregnated">asphalt-impregnated</reg> <lb/>
fiber or mastic to waterproof the opening.</p>
<p>The thickness of the reinforced slab is determined by the <reg orig="anti-|cipated">anticipated</reg> <lb/>
weight of vehicles, and by the stability of the subgrade, <lb/>
and by the quality of the concrete itself. In some situations it <lb/>
may be more economical to construct a thick slab of soft aggregate <lb/>
than to build a thin slab of hard aggregate. Availability of <lb/>
materials can be the determining factor in slab thickness.</p>
<div3 type="subsection" id="d61">
<head rend="left"><hi rend="underline">CURBS:</hi></head>
<p>I am a strong believer in mountable-type curb 'n gutter. The <lb/>
curb retains the shoulder, controls drainage on the pavement, and <lb/>
defines the edge of the pavement. Colored pigment can be added to <lb/>
the concrete to resemble the color of the local soils; also, <lb/>
colored aggregates can be selected and the finish exposed to resemble <lb/>
<pb n="3" entity="z000000510_0103" pid="uva-lib:151598"><fw type="sig" place="top-right">L-12</fw></pb>
the local soil. In any case, I prefer concrete with color pigment <lb/>
added to the mix. Don't use lamp black! It weakens the concrete <lb/>
and looks ugly. Use inorganic pigments; colors range from black <lb/>
to buff. Or use an aggregate of proper color...it makes a good <lb/>
job better.</p>
<p>NOTE: If you are working on defense roadways, be aware of the <lb/>
requirements for heavy wheel loads. Haunches or grade beams might <lb/>
be required at expansion joints, especially over soft subgrades.</p>
</div3>
<div3 type="subsection" id="d62">
<head rend="left"><hi rend="underline">BITUMINOUS PAVEMENTS:</hi></head>
<p>Bituminous pavements (asphalt) are cheaper to build than <reg orig="con-|crete">concrete</reg> <lb/>
pavements; they are more costly to maintain over the long <lb/>
haul (time period) but are easier to repair. The riding surface <lb/>
is smoother because expansion joints are not needed. However, <lb/>
chuckholes develop with freezing and thawing action. The black <lb/>
surface resists ice formation but it is vulnerable to damage from <lb/>
gasoline.</p>
<p>The advantages of concrete versus asphalt can be argued by <lb/>
people who know more about it than I do...but I like the Colonial, <lb/>
and the Suitland, and the Baltimore-Washington Parkways because <lb/>
it's my prejudicial nature.</p>
<p>The Asphalt Institute defines <hi rend="underline">Asphalt</hi> as, "A dark brown to <lb/>
black cementious material solid, semisolid, or liquid in consistency, <lb/>
in which the predominating constituents are bitumens which occur in <lb/>
nature as such or which are obtained as residue in refining <lb/>
"petroleum." (ASTM Designation D8)</p>
<p>The Asphalt Institute defines <hi rend="underline">Bitumen</hi> as, "A mixture of <reg orig="hydro-|carbons">hydrocarbons</reg> <lb/>
of natural or pyrogenous origin, or a combination of both; <lb/>
frequently accompanied by nonmetallic deriviatives which may be <lb/>
gaseous, liquid, semisolid, or solid; and which are completely <lb/>
soluble in carbon disulfide."</p>
<p>The key words indicate that asphalt may contain bitumen, and <lb/>
that bitumen is a mixture of hydrocarbons. Asphalt, then, is that <lb/>
black semisoft material mined in Venezuela which we use to mix with <lb/>
oil to make a road.</p>

<head rend="left"><hi rend="underline">SURFACING:</hi></head>
<p>Most park roads are bituminous concrete over a crushed stone <lb/>
subbase; the surface course may be a cold mix or hot sheet asphalt <lb/>
depending on availability of materials and climate. Big Bend has <lb/>
much heat, sand, and hard aggregate; Yellowstone has much cold, <lb/>
travertine, little aggregate. Crushed stone chips are apread over <lb/>
a tack coat to give the road surface a color and texture which blends <lb/>
into the immediate landscape hues. The South Rim Drive at Grand <lb/>
Canyon is surfaced with red chips; the roads at Craters of the Moon <lb/>
are surfaced with black chips. I prefer crushed gravel to rounded <lb/>
gravel (of uniform size) because it adheres to the tack coat longer. <lb/>
The angularity of particles exposes more surface area to be enclosed <lb/>
in road tar than is enclosed in rounded gravel particles.</p>
<p>Last summer our Park Engineer in Yellowstone used Asphalt <lb/>
Emulsion rather than road oil in applying a chip seal; the reason <lb/>
being the high cost of oil and gasoline. It worked as well as oil, <lb/>
we thought, and it will be interesting to see how the road came <lb/>
through the winter.</p>

a description of tests for soil properties; you'll see the California <lb/>
Bearing Ratio and other testing procedures. Check those out.</p>
<p>The Asphalt Institute has developed a method of estimating the <lb/>
necessary thickness of pavements based on traffic volumes equated <lb/>
to truck axle loads of 18,000 pounds; you can find the detailed <lb/>
explanations in the Institute's publication, <hi rend="underline">Thickness Design,</hi> MS-1. <lb/>
They classify traffic according to a system which they call IDT <lb/>
(Initial Daily Traffic). That is the volume of traffic expected <lb/>
the first year following completion:</p>
<list>
<item><p><hi rend="hang">Light traffic is up to 1,000 vehicles/day on two-lanes; <lb/>
equates to 10 trucks.</hi></p></item>
<item><p><hi rend="hang">Medium traffic is 1,000 to 100,000 vehicles/day on two-lanes; <lb/>
equates to 100 trucks.</hi></p></item>
<item><p><hi rend="hang">Heavy traffic is over 100,000 vehicles/day on two-lane or <reg orig="multi-|lane">multilane</reg> <lb/>

</list>

<p>Four examples are given in the text; each is calculated on a <lb/>
20-year service life, and an annual increase in traffic volume of 3%.</p>
<p><hi rend="hang">Example 1: A residential street carries 400 vehicles per day, CBR is 4; <lb/>

<p><hi rend="hang">Example 3: A suburban street carries 4,000 vehicles per day; CBR is 3; <lb/>

<p>An alternate is given for the Interstate where an equivalent <lb/>
pavement is 2.0 inches, on 4.0 inches, on a 5.0 inch subbase; an <lb/>

<div3 type="subsection" id="d70">
<head rend="left"><hi rend="underline">DETERMINING SIZE:</hi></head>
<p>The number of parking spaces to be provided is a function of <lb/>
<hi rend="underline">carrying capacity</hi>...that appropriate number of visitors which can <lb/>
be accommodated within the inherent capability of a land area to <lb/>
regenerate itself. The carrying capacity divided by 3.5 visitors <lb/>
per car will give you a reasonable estimate of the total number of <lb/>
parking spaces to be provided.</p>
<p>Let's look at a trail within a forested area. Say: the density <lb/>
of vegetation and the alignment will carry groups of five persons <lb/>
separated at intervals of not less than 500 feet, and that a closer <lb/>
interval would detract from the quality of enjoyment of an <reg orig="adja-|cent">adjacent</reg> <lb/>
group. The <hi rend="underline">carrying capacity</hi> would be the resultant of the <lb/>
length of the trail (5,000 feet) divided by the interval (500 feet) <lb/>
multiplied by the number of visitors per group (5 persons) for a <lb/>
total of <hi rend="underline">50 persons.</hi> Observations show that an additional 25% of <lb/>
that number will be in the parking area at the same time either <lb/>
starting to hike or returning from the trail. Parking spaces are <lb/>
needed for 50 plus 25% (say 12) or 62 persons, divided by 3.5 <lb/>
persons per car for a total of 18 spaces. At 300 SF per car, the <lb/>
parking area would require 5400 sq. ft. of surface and 180 feet of <lb/>
curb.</p>

<item><p>-90&deg; spaces require 9&prime;/car, 58&prime;- 0&prime; curb to curb, or <hi rend="underline">261</hi> SF/car</p></item>
</list>
<p>Even though cars today are smaller, there is need to design for <lb/>
the standard size automobile. It is my opinion that spaces of ample <lb/>
size are well worth the extra cost in paving; furthermore, parking <lb/>
areas of ample size allow two-way circulation thereby overcoming <lb/>
the need to provide circulatory roads. Howland recommends:</p>
<list>
<item><p>-90&deg; spaces, 10 feet wide, 60&prime;- 0&Prime; between curbs, or 300 SF/car.</p></item>
<item><p><hi rend="hang">-For single-rank parking areas, I recommend 45&prime;- 0&Prime; between <lb/>

<div3 type="subsection" id="d72">
<head rend="left"><hi rend="underline">Shade Trees:</hi></head>
<p>I recommend planting a shade tree in every fifth parking space <lb/>
to cool the temperature inside of cars parked under the canopy. <lb/>
That provides a maximum spacing of 40&prime;x 50&prime;. The alternative is <lb/>
planting of trees within the median between the ranks of cars. That <lb/>
provides a maximum spacing of 40&prime;x 70&prime;. Examine the plan and sections <lb/>
for the spacing recommended and the alternate.</p>
<p>Willow oak is, as you know, the shade tree I prefer. Pin oaks <lb/>
are not my choice because of the low habit of branching, though <lb/>
that species is an excellent tree to screen along the periphery. <lb/>
American elm is the ideal shape and density if you can justify the <lb/>
choice in the face of Dutch Elm Disease.</p>

<div3 type="subsection" id="d73">
<head rend="left"><hi rend="underline">Surfacing:</hi></head>
<p>Crushed gravel chips on a tack coat over a medium type pavement <lb/>
(i.e. 2&Prime; of surface over 4&Prime; of bituminous concrete, over a 5&Prime;crushed <lb/>
stone base) is adequate for parking areas in urban centers. Avoid <lb/>
smooth hot asphalt surfaces because leaves tend to make the surface <lb/>
slippery. Striping is a necessary evil to control density unless <lb/>
numbered posts are used. Parking meters serve the same purpose in <lb/>
municipal and commercial areas. I prefer posts.</p>

<head rend="left"><hi rend="underline">Drainage:</hi></head>
<p>Curb inlets are more efficient than flush grates located in the <lb/>
middle of parking areas along the centerline. Part of this prejudice <lb/>
is based on the observation that pedestrians walk along the <reg orig="center-|line">centerline</reg>, <lb/>
even though walkways are provided in the median. Leaves tend <lb/>
to build up over flush grate openings and are better collected in <lb/>
open throats along the curb than in the middle of the pavement. <lb/>
Also, consider the fact that noise can result from each car driving <lb/>
over a loose grate when the inlet is located on the centerline.</p>
</div3>
<div3 type="subsection" id="d75">
<head rend="left"><hi rend="underline">Curbs versus Wheelstops:</hi></head>
<p>I prefer cast-in-place concrete curbs (with exposed colored <lb/>
aggregate) to wheelstops which are precast. In natural areas, I <lb/>
like stone curbs or pressure treated timber, either dimensioned or <lb/>
cut from logs. (Don't use extruded asphalt...you know my opinion of <lb/>
that material.) Wheelstops are frequently fixed to the road surface <lb/>
with reinforcing steel, a material that is too small in diameter to <lb/>
resist the impact of the wheels, and so thin that it tends to act <lb/>
like a knife in cutting the surfacing material. Log and timber <lb/>
curb (consider ties at 6 x 8) can be imbedded in the surface or <lb/>
placed on the base before the surface course is applied. Log or <lb/>
timber has greater resistance to the impacts of car wheels than <lb/>
wheelstops.</p>
</div3>
<div3 type="subsection" id="d76">
<head rend="left"><hi rend="underline">CAUTION</hi>!!</head>
<p>The maximum slope on parking areas, in section or profile, should <lb/>
be 6%!! To exceed that gradient is to invite cars to roll downhill. <lb/>
Some drivers do indeed forget to set the handbrake or to leave the <lb/>
car in gear. Also, ice can be a problem in maneuvering into and out <lb/>
of parking spaces when grades exceed 6%.</p>
</div3>
<div3 type="subsection" id="d77">
<head rend="left"><hi rend="underline">SPECIAL CONDITIONS:</hi></head>
<p>Overflow parking areas need not be paved when they are only used <lb/>
occasionally. Overflow parking areas can be inconspicuous. You <lb/>
might consider stabilized turf rather than pavement. Lay down eight <lb/>
inches of #3 stone to grade; puddle the voids with topsoil, then seed <lb/>
with a deep-rooted grass (Kentucky Bluegrass). Be careful to let <lb/>
the grade of the topsoil be slightly below the surface of the stone.</p>

<head rend="left"><hi rend="underline">Campgrounds:</hi></head>
<p>The most efficient layout I've seen for campgrounds is at Grant <lb/>
Village, Yellowstone which was built to the criteria recommended by <lb/>
Frank Mattson, a Park Landscape Architect of outstanding ability. <lb/>
Frank said that campsites should be staggered along the roadway, <lb/>
one site per 35 LF of road; that parallel roads should be 125 feet <lb/>
between centerlines, and that a two-way throat should connect the <lb/>
one-way loop with the main campground road. Also, that three types <lb/>
of sites should be provided in equal proportions to accommodate <lb/>
tents, trailers, or RVs: spurs for back-ins, pull-throughs, and <lb/>
pull-offs. That's what was built and it functions well after 23 <lb/>
years of intense use.</p>
<p>Campground sanitation requires that the distance from the <lb/>
farthest site to the nearest comfort station will not exceed 300 <lb/>
feet, and that comfort stations should not be placed farther apart <lb/>
than 600 feet.</p>
</div3>
<div3 type="subsection" id="d79">
<head rend="left"><hi rend="underline">Bus Parking:</hi></head>
<p>Let buses be directed to the right in turning into spaces in <lb/>
order to provide access to the loading door; otherwise the doors <lb/>
are blocked by adjacent buses in turning to the left. I recommend <lb/>
a radius of 50 feet to the outside curb, a turning lane of 15 feet <lb/>
between curbs, parking spaces 12 feet wide, and a stabilized inside <lb/>
turf shoulder 2 feet wide.</p>
</div3>
<div3 type="subsection" id="d80">
<head rend="left"><hi rend="underline">Amphitheaters:</hi></head>
<p>Locate approach roads and parking areas so that head lights are <lb/>
directed away from, rather than toward, the seating area and <reg orig="pro-|jection">projection</reg> <lb/>
screen. Headlights can be distracting nuisances during <lb/>
after-dark interpretive programs. Provide low-level standards to <lb/>
light the trail to the parking area after the program is over.</p>

<head rend="left"><hi rend="underline">Trailer Parking at Boat Ramps:</hi></head>
<p>The most critical features in the design of public boat ramps <lb/>
are the width and gradient of the ramp itself. Let the ramp be <lb/>
40 feet wide and the grade 14%. That width will serve 3 boats at <lb/>
one time (all boats seem to leave and return at the same hour). <lb/>
That gradient will permit most boats to float free of a trailer <lb/>
<pb n="5" entity="z000000510_0117" pid="uva-lib:151618"><fw type="sig" place="top-right">L-13</fw></pb>
without submerging the towing vehicle. Also! Provide a surface of <lb/>
high traction, especially where algae is prevalent! Imagine yourself <lb/>
a novice driver towing a new boat and trailer. You approach the <lb/>
shoreline driving toward the ramp; you turn right until you see the <lb/>
boat and trailer reflected in the mirror on the car door. You then <lb/>
back toward the ramp, constantly watching the reflection in the mirror, <lb/>
until your boat and trailer are aligned with the ramp. You slowly <lb/>
back down the incline until the boat is bouyant. Then you stop, set <lb/>
the handbrake, turn the engine off, set the parking gear, and leave <lb/>
the car to unlash the boat from the trailer. After you have secured <lb/>
the boat to the pier, you drive the car and trailer to the parking <lb/>
area&mdash;they remain there all day.</p>
<p>After a day of fishing, you return to the pier, secure the boat, <lb/>
and drive the car and empty trailer back to the ramp. This time you <lb/>
watch the trailer reflected in the mirror, then back down the ramp <lb/>
until the trailer is submerged. You stop, set the handbrake, turn <lb/>
the engine off, set the parking gear, and leave the car to load the <lb/>
boat on the trailer. Then you drive straight up the ramp and away.</p>
<p>All quite complicated in description, but the simplest way I know <lb/>
to design a ramp and parking area for the boater who uses the place <lb/>
ten times a year.</p>

<head rend="left">LECTURE <hi rend="underline">14</hi> ROAD CONSTRUCTION</head>
<p>This lecture is an experiment. We will test the proposition that <lb/>
the usual lecture in Road Construction can be combined with a lesson <lb/>
in <hi rend="underline">Critical Path Method</hi> (CPM)</p>
<p>Some years ago, I arranged a contract with a Mr. Dominic to <lb/>
conduct a training session for our people in Design and Construction <lb/>
so that we might improve our record in meeting deadlines. Mr. <reg orig="Dom-|inic">Dominic</reg> <lb/>
was retired from the General Services Administration where he <lb/>
enjoyed a good reputation for getting jobs done and buildings <reg orig="com-|pleted">completed</reg> <lb/>
on time.</p>
<p>He told this story: a successful private design office had just <lb/>
finished a large job on schedule and was enjoying a lull in the <lb/>
momentum of the office. Suddenly several jobs went bad and the staff <lb/>
was busy putting handles on projects that were underway. Just as <lb/>
quickly, the office failed and the principals met to ask why. At <lb/>
the moment of the lull, a critical action was overlooked! It wasn't <lb/>
planned to happen that way.</p>
<p>Mr. Dominic's two-day training contract was an education in <lb/>
controlling our work. We met deadlines and learned that CPM can <lb/>
be applied to many cases.</p>
<p>Suppose you are working for Jones and Jones, Landscape Architects <lb/>
based in Charlotte, N.C.. You have just been awarded a contract for <lb/>
professional services to design and supervise the construction of a <lb/>
road over the Blue Ridge from Stanardsville to Elkton. Your firm <lb/>
is to be paid from Federal-Aid funds with the requirement that <reg orig="Super-|intendent">Superintendent</reg> <lb/>
of Shenandoah National Park must approve all phases of <lb/>
the work. You are named Project Supervisor for the job.</p>
<p>Here's how CPM works:</p>
<list>
<label>Step 1.</label><item><p>List every activity that must happen to build the road.</p></item>
<label>2.</label><item><p>List the sequence in which these activities must occur.</p></item>
<label>3.</label><item><p>Assign the number of days needed to complete each activity.</p></item>
<label>4.</label><item><p>Diagram the sequence showing the number of days assigned.</p></item>
<label>5.</label><item><p>MONITOR THE PROJECTS DAILY!</p></item>
</list>
<p>Let's start by listing the activities that must happen, Step 1.</p>

<head rend="left">LECTURE <hi rend="underline">15</hi> - MAINTENANCE</head>
<p>As you know, 01'Ben started work on a road crew in the CCC and <lb/>
then as a gardener in Maintenance and Horticulture, National Park <lb/>
Service. I'm still a Maintenance Guy!</p>
<p>One fourth of all highway funds go for maintenance; these costs <lb/>
will increase as the Interstate System ages. According to Clarkson <lb/>
Oglesby in his book <hi rend="underline">Highway Engineering,</hi> it takes 3.1 persons to <lb/>
maintain one lane-mile of rural roads compared to 37.4 persons on <lb/>
city streets. He cites costs for 1970: $4.3 billion of the <lb/>
$18.8 billion highway expenses were spent for maintenance. Traffic <lb/>
services (the cost in wages for control devices and flagmen) cost <lb/>
12%; operation of toll roads and bridges cost 8%; snow removal and <lb/>
sanding cost 14%; the remainder, 61% was spent for road and roadside <lb/>
maintenance. Add to that the growing trend that in tort cases, the <lb/>
Courts (justifiably) are holding maintenance personnel responsible <lb/>
for injuries to motorists.</p>
<div3 type="subsection" id="d95">
<head rend="left"><hi rend="underline">Working Relationships:</hi></head>
<p>You may find yourself called upon to advise maintenance people <lb/>
about many matters of aesthetics important to their operations. <lb/>
If you accept a job in maintenance, you will be sharing much time <lb/>
with a civil engineer in the office and in the field. That person <lb/>
will be as dedicated to the job of maintaining the pavement and <lb/>
structures as you are to maintaining the roadside. You may well be <lb/>
the first landscape architect that person has worked with, simply <lb/>
because civil engineers far outnumber landscape architects. Be <lb/>
patient! You'll get more done together than either of you will <lb/>
working alone! Remember, that we have a tradition of working together <lb/>
since 1926 when the interbureau agreement was signed. We share a <lb/>
proud history.</p>
</div3>
<div3 type="subsection" id="d96">
<head rend="left"><hi rend="underline">Roadside Vegetation:</hi></head>
<p>The difficulty with road construction, as we've talked before, <lb/>
is that we build a seedbed on both sides of the pavement that must <lb/>
indeed be managed. That management of roadside vegetation is <lb/>
usually the job of the landscape architect and your professional <lb/>
judgment is expected for controlling volunteer seeding of "weeds." <lb/>
Look for the seed source; examine the soil surface on which the <lb/>
<pb n="2" entity="z000000510_0128" pid="uva-lib:151633"><fw type="sig" place="top-right">L-15</fw></pb>
seeds germinate. You may not have an immediate solution, but strive <lb/>
for a <hi rend="underline">natural</hi> method of control rather than a typical method. If you <lb/>
don't respond, herbicides and asphalt mats will be used to solve the <lb/>
"problem." The task you face most often is to understand the <reg orig="situa-|tion">situation</reg> <lb/>
quickly and to offer a solution based on natural processes <lb/>
rather than artificial methods.</p>
</div3>
<div3 type="subsection" id="d97">
<head rend="left"><hi rend="underline">De-icing Chemicals:</hi></head>
<p>Calcium chloride is slowly causing widespread damage to <reg orig="down-|stream">downstream</reg> <lb/>
habitat as well as roadside vegetation. Research is warranted <lb/>
to determine the effects of calcium chloride on the corrosion of <lb/>
metals in concrete, on bridge rails, and on plant materials. Two <lb/>
million tons of salt were laid down annually in the mid-sixties <lb/>
according to Oglesby; every ton was handled by maintenance people! <lb/>
And we will be concerned about the effects of that practice until a <lb/>
substitute material can be found. In my judgment, the marketing and <lb/>
using of salt were irresponsible in the beginning, and will continue <lb/>
to be so until acceptable substitutes are developed through research.</p>
</div3>
<div3 type="subsection" id="d98">
<head rend="left"><hi rend="underline">Maintenance Plans:</hi></head>
<p>You are required to prepare plans for the maintenance of the <lb/>
roadside: where to mow, where to permit the volunteers to occupy <lb/>
slopes, where to cut and maintain vistas, and the schedule for <lb/>
mowing to insure the seeding of wildflowers. You can help if you <lb/>
will show the location of all culverts, drop inlets, and subdrains <lb/>
on your plan for maintenance. On the drawing, include a list of all <lb/>
drainage structures located by centerline stationing <hi rend="underline">and</hi> the road <lb/>
distance measured on the <hi rend="underline">odometer</hi> so that crews can find the <reg orig="struc-|tures">structures</reg> <lb/>
from the truck. Remember that most employees are seasonals <lb/>
who don't know where things are. When the boss can't be reached <lb/>
on the radio, seasonals are frustrated by the lack of information.</p>
</div3>
<div3 type="subsection" id="d99">
<head rend="left"><hi rend="underline">Ditches:</hi></head>
<p>One of the greatest causes of road failures is our neglecting <lb/>
to clean ditches. Debris and soil build up over flush grates to <lb/>
the depth that the inlet is obscured and is eventually "lost." <lb/>
The last person who knew its location is now at Everglades and the <lb/>
new R&amp;T foreman didn't get the word. Deep or V-shaped ditches are <lb/>
given little maintenance because it's difficult to work the ditchline <lb/>
<pb n="3" entity="z000000510_0129" pid="uva-lib:151634"><fw type="sig" place="top-right">L-15</fw></pb>
with machinery. Be an advocate for broad shallow ditches. They are <lb/>
safer and easier to maintain.</p>
</div3>
<div3 type="subsection" id="d100">
<head rend="left"><hi rend="underline">Inspection of Culverts:</hi></head>
<p>Include in your maintenance plan a program for the annual <reg orig="in-|spection">inspection</reg> <lb/>
of culverts showing the length and direction of the pipe <lb/>
and any problems you know about. We lost a section of West Beach <lb/>
Drive when a culvert broke under a heavy fill....and you saw the <lb/>
photograph of the earth-slide we had at Yellowstone when a culvert <lb/>
broke. Storms and rapid snow melt can cause runoff volumes which <lb/>
exceed the design capacity of structures and culverts. Observe <lb/>
the warning signs: <hi rend="underline">bulges</hi> at the toes of slopes, <hi rend="underline">debris</hi> left by <lb/>
highwater over the tops of culverts, <hi rend="underline">erosion</hi> on streambanks, and the <lb/>
<hi rend="underline">fans</hi> of sediments deposited below the outfalls of culverts. Spend <lb/>
a day riding the roads with the crew boss...ask where changes are <lb/>
occurring and what it was like five years ago.</p>
</div3>
<div3 type="subsection" id="d101">
<head rend="left"><hi rend="underline">Inspection of Bridges:</hi></head>
<p>In writing a maintenance program, require that bridges be <reg orig="in-|spected">inspected</reg> <lb/>
annually! The frequency of structural deterioration in <lb/>
recent years is alarming! We see the corrosion of incompatible <lb/>
metals on bridge rails and the effects of salt on concrete bridge <lb/>
decks too late to employ routine repairs. By the time we discover <lb/>
the effects, the "damage" requires replacement. Turkey Run, Spout <lb/>
Run, 14th Street Bridge, even the pier nosings under Key Bridge were <lb/>
so far deteriorated before the damage was discovered that the <reg orig="struc-|tures">structures</reg> <lb/>
were no longer safe. Again, institute a program for annual <lb/>
inspection by structural engineers. Write a contract for their <reg orig="re-|curring">recurring</reg> <lb/>
services. Put that on your checklist. See that it happens!</p>
</div3>
<div3 type="subsection" id="d102">
<head rend="left"><hi rend="underline">Resurfacing:</hi></head>
<p>We've been finding a loss of friction on surfaces worn smooth <lb/>
by long use. Heavier wheel loads and studded tires are causing <reg orig="in-|creased">increased</reg> <lb/>
damage to thin surface and base courses, especially on roads <lb/>
constructed for lighter traffic before urban growth took over the <lb/>
rural roadways. Examine the depth and condition of pavement and <lb/>
subbase when you are writing maintenance programs; surface evidence <lb/>
alone is an insufficient indicator.</p>

<p>Look at the condition of shoulders and ditchlines. "Bootleg <lb/>
parking places" develop where motorists stop their cars to <reg orig="photo-|graph">photograph</reg> <lb/>
a herd of elk or a mountain reflected on the lake, or just <lb/>
to fish. You must decide whether to pave it (and make it legal) or <lb/>
to barricade it for reasons of safety. Be especially careful that <lb/>
<hi rend="underline">sight distance</hi> is adequate if you let it stay!</p>
</div3>
<div3 type="subsection" id="d105">
<head rend="left"><hi rend="underline">Overlooks:</hi></head>
<p>In placing guardrail or parapets at overlooks, let the setbacks <lb/>
from the edge of pavement be ample so that motorists can park safely <lb/>
<hi rend="underline">or</hi> close enough to the pavement edge to <hi rend="underline">prevent</hi> their parking...we <lb/>
can't have both! And don't locate parking areas on one side of the <lb/>
pavement where cars must drive across the opposing land <hi rend="underline">unless</hi> <lb/>
there is ample sight distance in both directions! I believe it's <lb/>
safer to provide a deceleration lane and a 90&deg; throat than to bring <lb/>
cars into a long acute angle approach of insufficient length to <lb/>
slow down.</p>

<div3 type="subsection" id="d106">
<head rend="left"><hi rend="underline">Relocation:</hi></head>
<p>Road improvements are absolute mistakes if the new curves signal <lb/>
higher speeds. Example: a curve regarded as "too sharp" is "<reg orig="flat-|tened">flattened</reg>" <lb/>
for improvement. The easier improvement may have been to <lb/>
remove vegetation on the inside of the curve to improve sight <reg orig="dis-|tance">distance</reg>, <lb/>
and then plant several trees along the outside to warn drivers <lb/>
that the road ahead changes direction. As we learned in the <reg orig="defini-|tion">definition</reg> <lb/>
of assumed design speed, drivers' perceptions of what's ahead <lb/>
influences speed. Reconstructing a sharp curve to make it safer <hi rend="underline">can</hi> <lb/>
signal that speed may be increased. Again, let <hi rend="underline">uniformity</hi> and <reg orig="grad-|ual">gradual</reg> <lb/>
increases in design speed be your watchwords...inconsistencies <lb/>
<pb n="5" entity="z000000510_0131" pid="uva-lib:151636"><fw type="sig" place="top-right">L-15</fw></pb>
and surprises increase the numbers of accidents! Know that <reg orig="acci-|dents">accidents</reg> <lb/>
will occur; it is your job to predict where they are most <lb/>
likely to happen and design for the safest conditions possible.</p>
</div3>
<div3 type="subsection" id="d107">
<head rend="left"><hi rend="underline">Traffic Control Devices:</hi></head>
<p>Civil engineers have responsibility for maintaining traffic <lb/>
lights, overseeing the accident recording procedures, striping <reg orig="center-|lines">centerlines</reg>, <lb/>
and gathering traffic data; all this from a plan designed by <lb/>
a traffic engineer. You will be required to know about those tasks <lb/>
because you'll be asked to assist. Learn what it costs to do those <lb/>
jobs so that you can write realistic estimates when the civil is <lb/>
away. Be aware of traffic hazards and report them immediately! <lb/>
We all have responsibility for safety.</p>

<div3 type="subsection" id="d108">
<head rend="left"><hi rend="underline">Roadside Markers:</hi></head>
<p>Markers are by nature very specialized communicators. They tell <lb/>
the motorists the stories of historical events, the names of streams <lb/>
and the animals who need them for water, and of the people associated <lb/>
with a place. Signs require your knowledge and sensitivity for a <lb/>
place, as well as your design talent. You can order stock signs <lb/>
from <hi rend="underline">Seewah Studios</hi> or have them make it from your design. Or you <lb/>
can have it done in the signshop or by contract. Some prison <reg orig="indus-|tries">industries</reg> <lb/>
will make signs under a reimburseable account. My advice is <lb/>
to design your own signs...you'll be happier with the result.</p>
</div3>
<div3 type="subsection" id="d109">
<head rend="left"><hi rend="underline">Maintenance of Roadsigns:</hi></head>
<p>Roadsigns can be of four separate and functional types: <lb/>
<hi rend="underline">directional</hi> signs point the way of the travel path; <hi rend="underline">informational</hi> <lb/>
signs tell the distance to places ahead; <hi rend="underline">regulatory</hi> signs tell where <lb/>
to stop, yield, or slow down and the speed limit; <hi rend="underline">interpretive</hi> signs <lb/>
tell of the features along the way to help motorists enjoy the <reg orig="exper-|ience">experience</reg> <lb/>
of the landscape. More time is spent defending the roadsides <lb/>
against additional signs than in designing signs. You will be asked <lb/>
to approve all sorts of regulatory signs: "no parking, no standing, <lb/>
no fishing, don't walk, don't run, don't picnic,..." All negative <lb/>
messages emanating from concerns for law enforcement. Defend the <lb/>
visitors! They <hi rend="underline">own</hi> the place.</p>
<p>Defend also the existing sign themes when you are pressured to <lb/>
adopt the current trends. We've been pressured to adopt the brown <lb/>
<pb n="6" entity="z000000510_0132" pid="uva-lib:151637"><fw type="sig" place="top-right">L-15</fw></pb>
metal reflective signboards and to remove the long established theme <lb/>
of routed letters on wood. I believe that Yellowstone, the world's <lb/>
first National Park, should keep its traditional themes in signs, <lb/>
architecture, and roadside interpretation.</p>
<p>Instruct signshop people to <hi rend="underline">avoid varnishes</hi> mixed in stains <lb/>
and signboard-paints. The varnish reflects light and thereby blurs <lb/>
the reflective forms of the text. See, too, that mud and dust are <lb/>
cleaned from the beaded letters for brightness at night. The signs <lb/>
are on the roadsides communicating their messages 24 hours a day. <lb/>
Treat them well!</p>

<head rend="left"><hi rend="underline">International System of Sign Symbols:</hi></head>
<p>The SSS was a joint effort between landscape architects of Parks <lb/>
Canada and our Service to build signs that would be understood by <lb/>
foreign visitors. Doc Savage of Ottawa and Bill Rosenberg of <reg orig="Wash-|ington">Washington</reg> <lb/>
worked out the methods; Judy Babb designed the symbols. <lb/>
(Larry Quarrick will give you handouts of the symbols; you'll find <lb/>
them helpful.)</p>

<head rend="left"><hi rend="underline">Assimilation:</hi></head>
<p>As park roads are swallowed up by the street and highway systems <lb/>
of the cities and states, so too are signs and symbols. In 1953 when <lb/>
working on the final phases of the Baltimore-Washington Parkway, <lb/>
I presented a design for green signboards with white lettering to <lb/>
distinguish the Parkway from the adjacent streets and highways. <lb/>
The engineers of the Bureau opposed the use of green because it <lb/>
lacked the contrast of standard black and white signs. We had one <lb/>
made in our signshop and installed it as an experiment. People <lb/>
from 3M saw it and offered to make a sample using their new product <lb/>
called Scotchlite, a reflective signboard material. That was the <lb/>
beginning of the green background signs you see on the Interstates <lb/>
today.</p>
<p>The same thing happened with the long map-like arrows and circles <lb/>
you see at interchanges. Tommy Herr designed the first sign of that <lb/>
type for the traffic circle on the Virginia side of the Memorial <lb/>
Bridge. The International Symbols developed for parks met the same <lb/>
success...you can't keep exclusive rights to a good idea!</p>

<head rend="left"><hi rend="underline">Scouting Problems:</hi></head>
<p>Lack of maintenance shows up first in the amount of litter along <lb/>
the roadside. The next sign is the failure of the road shoulder at <lb/>
the pavement edge. (Maintenance people will say they've been "pickin' <lb/>
sanitation and fillin' ruts.") Look to see where their time is being <lb/>
spent. If they have been rebuilding an obsolete disposal system or <lb/>
repairing a fault in the design of a facility, it shows up first in <lb/>
the maintenance of the roadside.</p>
<p>Faults in design cost hours of labor and equipment time which <lb/>
would best be spent in maintenance. As I've told some of you, when <lb/>
you are called on to advise a client on improving a maintenance <lb/>
operation, pay your respects to the manager in the front office, then <lb/>
go to the maintenance foreman to learn where the problems are. Chances <lb/>
are that the manager moving up in the company has been there several <lb/>
years...the guy in the maintenance yard has been there twenty. He <lb/>
knows where the valve boxes are and can tell you where he steals <reg orig="top-|soil">topsoil</reg> <lb/>
and culvert pipe. He's the most under-rated person in the place <lb/>
and has more workable ideas than the manager even suspects.</p>

<div3 type="subsection" id="d113">
<head rend="left"><hi rend="underline">Performance Standards:</hi></head>
<p>There are two keys to managing a maintenance operation: the first <lb/>
is to Manage by Objective; the second is to measure results according <lb/>
to Performance Standards that say, "the level of roadside maintenance <lb/>
will be acceptable when..." and the standards are spelled out. <lb/>
Examples: ditches are acceptable when there is no evidence of <reg orig="ero-|sion">erosion</reg>; <lb/>
when ruts caused by tire tracks off the pavement are raked-out <lb/>
and seeded within two days; when roadside planting contains all of <lb/>
the trees that have survived or been replaced as shown on the approved <lb/>
planting plan; when drop inlets are cleared of debris within a week <lb/>
of a summer storm; and so on...</p>
<p>Maintenance is the subject of a course in itself. May some of <lb/>
these thoughts be useful to you.</p>
