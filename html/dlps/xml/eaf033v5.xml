<hi rend="bold">I. E. ROSENBERG.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">You</hi> are anxious to obtain some <reg orig="know-|ledge">knowledge</reg> <lb/>
of the history of Constantia Dudley. I am well <reg orig="ac-|quainted">acquainted</reg> <lb/>
with your motives, and allow that they justify <lb/>
your curiosity. I am willing, to the utmost of my power, to <lb/>
comply with your request, and will now dedicate what <reg orig="lei-|sure">leisure</reg> <lb/>
I have to the composition of her story.</p>
<p>My narrative will have little of that merit which flows <lb/>
from unity of design. You are desirous of hearing an <reg orig="au-|thentic">authentic</reg>, <lb/>
and not a fictitious tale. It will, therefore, be my <lb/>
duty to relate events is no artificial or elaborate order, and <lb/>
without that harmonious congruity and luminous <reg orig="amplifica-|tion">amplification</reg>, <lb/>
which might justly be displayed in a tale flowing <reg orig="mere-|ly">merely</reg> <lb/>
from invention. It will be little more than a biographical <lb/>
sketch, in which the facts are distributed and amplified, not <lb/>
as a poetical taste would prescribe, but as the materials <lb/>
afforded me, sometimes abundant and sometimes scanty, <lb/>
would permit.</p>
<p>Constantia, like all the beings made known to us, not by <lb/>
fancy, but experience, has numerous defects. You will <reg orig="read-|ily">readily</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="iv" entity="eaf033v5_0017" pid="uva-lib:350283"/>
perceive, that her tale is told by her friend, but I hope <lb/>
you will not discover many or glaring proofs of a <reg orig="disposi-|tion">disposition</reg> <lb/>
to extenuate her errors or falsify her character.</p>
<p>Ormond will, perhaps, appear to you a contradictory or <lb/>
unintelligible being. I pretend not to the infallibility of <reg orig="in-|spiration">inspiration</reg>. <lb/>
He is not a creature of fancy. It was not <reg orig="pru-|dent">prudent</reg> <lb/>
to unfold <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the means by which I gained a knowledge <lb/>
of his actions; but these means, though singularly fortunate <lb/>
and accurate, could not be unerring and complete. I have <lb/>
shown him to you as he appeared, on different occasions and <lb/>
at successive periods, to me. This is all that you will <reg orig="de-|mand">demand</reg> <lb/>
from a faithful biographer.</p>
<p>If you were not deeply interested in the fate of my friend, <lb/>
yet my undertaking will not be useless, inasmuch as it will <reg orig="in-|troduce">introduce</reg> <lb/>
you to scenes to which you have been hitherto a <reg orig="stran-|ger">stranger</reg>. <lb/>
The modes of life, the influence of public events upon <lb/>
the character and happiness of individuals in America, are <lb/>
new to you. The distinctions of birth, the artificial degrees of <lb/>
esteem or contempt which connect themselves with different <lb/>
professions and ranks in your native country,<ref target="n1" n="1">*</ref>
<note id="n1" place="foot" n="1"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>Germany.</p></note>
 are but little <lb/>
known among us. Society and manners constitute your <reg orig="fa-|vorite">favorite</reg> <lb/>
study, and I am willing to believe, that my relation <lb/>
will supply you with knowledge, on these heads, not to be <lb/>
otherwise obtained. If these details be, in that respect, <reg orig="un-|satisfactory">unsatisfactory</reg>, <lb/>
all that I can add, is my counsel to go and <reg orig="ex-|amine">examine</reg> <lb/>
for yourself.</p>

THE SECRET WITNESS.</head>

<head type="sub">CHAPTER I.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Stephen Dudley</hi> was a native of New York. He was <lb/>
educated to the profession of a painter. His father's trade <lb/>
was that of an apothecary. But this son, manifesting an <reg orig="at-|tachment">attachment</reg> <lb/>
to the pencil, he was resolved that it should be <lb/>
gratified. For this end Stephen was sent at an early age <lb/>
to Europe, and not only enjoyed the instructions of Fuzeli <lb/>
and Bartolozzi, but spent a considerable period in Italy, in <lb/>
studying the Augustan and Medicean monuments. It was <lb/>
intended that he should practice his art in his native city, but <lb/>
the young man, though reconciled to this scheme by <reg orig="defer-|ence">deference</reg> <lb/>
to paternal authority, and by a sense of its propriety, <lb/>
was willing, as long as possible to postpone it. The liberality <lb/>
of his father relieved him from all pecuniary cares. His <lb/>
whole time was devoted to the improvement of his skill in his <lb/>
favorite art, and the enriching of his mind with every <reg orig="valua-|ble">valuable</reg> <lb/>
accomplishment. He was endowed with a <reg orig="comprehen-|sive">comprehensive</reg> <lb/>
genius and indefatigable industry. His progress was <lb/>
proportionably rapid, and he passed his time without much <lb/>
regard to futurity, being too well satisfied with the present to <lb/>
anticipate a change. A change however was unavoidable, <lb/>
and he was obliged at length to pay a reluctant obedience to <lb/>
his father's repeated summons. The death of his wife had <lb/>
rendered his society still more necessary to the old gentleman.</p>
<pb n="6" entity="eaf033v5_0019" pid="uva-lib:350285"/>
<p>He married before his return. The woman whom he had <lb/>
selected was an unportioned orphan, and was <reg orig="recommend-|ed">recommended</reg> <lb/>
merely by her moral qualities. These, however, were <lb/>
eminent, and secured to her, till the end of her life, the <reg orig="af-|fection">affection</reg> <lb/>
of her husband. Though painting was capable of <lb/>
fully gratifying his taste as matter of amusement, he quickly <lb/>
found that, in his new situation it would not answer the ends <lb/>
of a profession. His father supported himself by the profits <lb/>
of his shop, but with all his industry he could do no more <lb/>
than procure a subsistence for himself and his son.</p>
<p>Till his father's death young Dudley attached himself to <lb/>
painting. His gains were slender but he loved the art, and <lb/>
his father's profession rendered his own exertions in a great <lb/>
degree superfluous. The death of the elder Dudley <reg orig="intro-|duced">introduced</reg> <lb/>
an important change in his situation. It thenceforth <lb/>
became necessary to strike into some new path, to deny <lb/>
himself the indulgence of his inclinations, and regulate <lb/>
his future exertions by a view to nothing but gain. There <lb/>
was little room for choice. His habits had disqualified him <lb/>
for mechanical employments. He could not stoop to the <lb/>
imaginary indignity which attended them, nor spare the time <lb/>
necessary to obtain the requisite degree of skill. His father <lb/>
died in possession of some stock, and a sufficient portion of <lb/>
credit to supply its annual decays. He lived at what they <lb/>
call a <hi rend="italic">good stand,</hi> and enjoyed a certain quantity of <reg orig="perma-|nent">permanent</reg> <lb/>
custom. The knowledge that was required was as <lb/>
easily obtained as the elements of any other profession, and <lb/>
was not wholly unallied to the pursuits in which he had <reg orig="some-|times">sometimes</reg> <lb/>
engaged. Hence he could not hesitate long in forming <lb/>
his resolution, but assumed the management of his father's <lb/>
concerns with a cheerful and determined spirit.</p>
<p>The knowledge of his business was acquired in no long <lb/>
time. He was stimulated to the acquisition by a sense of <lb/>
duty, he was inured to habits of industry, and there were few <lb/>
things capable to resist a strenuous exertion of his faculties. <lb/>
Knowledge of whatever kind afforded a compensation to <lb/>
labor, but the task being finished, that which remained, <lb/>
which, in ordinary apprehensions would have been esteemed <lb/>
an easy and smooth path, was to him insupportably disgustful. <lb/>
The drudgery of a shop, where all the faculties were at a <lb/>
stand, and one day was an unvaried repetition of the <reg orig="fore-|going">foregoing</reg>, <lb/>
<pb n="7" entity="eaf033v5_0020" pid="uva-lib:350286"/>
was too incongenial to his disposition not to be a source <lb/>
of discontent. This was an evil which it was the tendency <lb/>
of time to increase rather than diminish. The longer he <lb/>
endured it the less tolerable it became. He could not <reg orig="for-|bear">forbear</reg> <lb/>
comparing his present situation with his former, and <lb/>
deriving from the contrast perpetual food for melancholy.</p>
<p>The indulgence of his father had contributed to instil into <lb/>
him prejudices, in consequence of which a certain species of <lb/>
disgrace was annexed to every employment of which the <lb/>
only purpose was gain. His present situation not only <reg orig="pre-|cluded">precluded</reg> <lb/>
all those pursuits which exalt and harmonize the <reg orig="feel-|ings">feelings</reg>, <lb/>
but was detested by him as something humiliating and <lb/>
ignominious. His wife was of a pliant temper, and her <lb/>
condition less influenced by this change than that of her <reg orig="hus-|band">husband</reg>. <lb/>
She was qualified to be his comforter, but instead of <lb/>
dispelling his gloom by judicious arguments, or a seasonable <lb/>
example of vivacity, she caught the infection that preyed upon <lb/>
his mind and augmented his anxieties by partaking in them.</p>
<p>By enlarging in some degree, the foundation on which his <lb/>
father had built, he had provided the means of a future <reg orig="se-|cession">secession</reg>, <lb/>
and might console himself with the prospect of <reg orig="en-|joying">enjoying</reg> <lb/>
his darling ease at some period of his life. This <lb/>
period was necessarily too remote for his wishes, and had <lb/>
not certain occurrences taken place, by which he was <reg orig="flatter-|ed">flattered</reg> <lb/>
with the immediate possession of ease, it is far from being <lb/>
certain that he would not have fallen a victim to his growing <lb/>
disquietudes.</p>
<p>He was one morning engaged behind his counter as usual, <lb/>
when a youth came into his shop, and, in terms that bespoke <lb/>
the union of fearlessness and frankness, inquired whether he <lb/>
could be engaged as an apprentice. A proposal of this kind <lb/>
could not be suddenly rejected or adopted. He stood in <lb/>
need of assistance, the youth was manly and blooming, and <lb/>
exhibited a modest and ingenuous aspect. It was possible <lb/>
that he was, in every respect, qualified for the post for which <lb/>
he applied, but it was previously necessary to ascertain these <lb/>
qualifications. For this end he requested the youth to call <lb/>
at his house in the evening, when he should be at leisure to <lb/>
converse with him and furnished him with suitable directions.</p>
<p>The youth came according to appointment. On being <lb/>
questioned as to his birth-place and origin, he stated that he <lb/>
<pb n="8" entity="eaf033v5_0021" pid="uva-lib:350287"/>
was a native of Wakefield, in Yorkshire; that his family were <lb/>
honest, and his education not mean; that he was the eldest <lb/>
of many children, and having attained an age at which he <reg orig="con-|ceived">conceived</reg> <lb/>
it his duty to provide for himself, he had, with the <reg orig="con-|currence">concurrence</reg> <lb/>
of his friends, come to America, in search of the <lb/>
means of independent subsistence; that he had just arrived in <lb/>
a ship which he named, and, his scanty stock of money being <lb/>
likely to be speedily consumed, this had been the first effort <lb/>
he had made to procure employment.</p>
<p>His tale was circumstantial and consistent, and his veracity <lb/>
appeared liable to no doubt. He was master of his book <lb/>
and his pen, and had acquired more than the rudiments of <lb/>
Latin. Mr. Dudley did not require much time to deliberate. <lb/>
In a few days the youth was established as a member of his <lb/>
family, and as a coadjutor in his shop, nothing but food, <lb/>
clothing, and lodging being stipulated as the reward of his <lb/>
services.</p>
<p>The young man improved daily in the good opinion of his <lb/>
master. His apprehension was quick, his sobriety invariable, <lb/>
and his application incessant. Though by no means <reg orig="presump-|tuous">presumptuous</reg> <lb/>
or arrogant, he was not wanting in a suitable degree of <lb/>
self-confidence. All his propensities appeared to concentre <lb/>
in his occupation and the promotion of his master's interest, <lb/>
from which he was drawn aside by no allurements of sensual <lb/>
or intellectual pleasure. In a short time he was able to <reg orig="re-|lieve">relieve</reg> <lb/>
his master of most of the toils of his profession, and <lb/>
Mr. Dudley a thousand times congratulated himself on <reg orig="pos-|sessing">possessing</reg> <lb/>
a servant equally qualified by his talents and his <lb/>
probity. He gradually remitted his attention to his own <reg orig="con-|cerns">concerns</reg>, <lb/>
and placed more absolute reliance on the fidelity of <lb/>
his dependant.</p>
<p>Young Craig, that was the name of the youth, maintained <lb/>
a punctual correspondence with his family, and confided to <lb/>
his patron, not only copies of all the letters which he himself <lb/>
wrote, but those which, from time to time, he received. He <lb/>
had several correspondents, but the chief of those were his <lb/>
mother and his eldest sister. The sentiments contained in <lb/>
their letters breathed the most appropriate simplicity and <reg orig="ten-|derness">tenderness</reg>, <lb/>
and flowed, with the nicest propriety, from the <reg orig="dif-|ferent">different</reg> <lb/>
relationships of mother and sister. The style and even <lb/>
the penmanship were distinct and characteristical.</p>
<pb n="9" entity="eaf033v5_0022" pid="uva-lib:350288"/>
<p>One of the first of these epistles was written by the mother <lb/>
to Mr. Dudley, on being informed by her son of his present <lb/>
engagement. It was dictated by that concern for the welfare <lb/>
of her child befitting the maternal character. Gratitude, for <lb/>
the ready acceptance of the youth's services, and for the <reg orig="be-|nignity">benignity</reg> <lb/>
of his deportment towards him, a just representation <lb/>
of which had been received by her from the boy himself, was <lb/>
expressed with no inconsiderable elegance; as well as her <lb/>
earnest wishes that Mr. Dudley should extend to him not <lb/>
only the indulgence, but the moral superintendence of a <lb/>
parent.</p>
<p>To this Mr. Dudley conceived it incumbent upon him to <lb/>
return a consenting answer, and letters were in this manner <lb/>
occasionally interchanged between them.</p>
<p>Things remained in this situation for three years, during <lb/>
which period every day enhanced the reputation of Craig, <lb/>
for stability and integrity. A sort of provisional engagement <lb/>
had been made between the parents, unattended however by <lb/>
any legal or formal act, that things should remain on their <lb/>
present footing for three years. When this period terminated, <lb/>
it seemed as if a new engagement had become necessary. <lb/>
Craig expressed the utmost willingness to renew the former <lb/>
contract, but his master began to think that the services of <lb/>
his pupil merited a higher recompense. He ascribed the <lb/>
prosperity that had hitherto attended him, to the disinterested <lb/>
exertions of his apprentice. His social and literary <reg orig="gratifica-|tions">gratifications</reg> <lb/>
had been increased by the increase of his leisure. <lb/>
These were capable of being still more enlarged. He had <lb/>
not yet acquired what he deemed a sufficiency, and could <lb/>
not therefore wholly relieve himself from the turmoils and <lb/>
humiliation of a professional life. He concluded that he <lb/>
should at once consult his own interest and perform no more <lb/>
than an act of justice to a faithful servant, by making Craig <lb/>
his partner, and allowing him a share of the profits, on <reg orig="con-|dition">condition</reg> <lb/>
of his discharging all the duties of the trade.</p>
<p>When this scheme was proposed to Craig, he professed <lb/>
unbounded gratitude, considered all that he had done as <lb/>
amply rewarded by the pleasure of performance, and as <lb/>
being nothing more than was prescribed by his duty. He <lb/>
promised that this change in his situation should have no other <lb/>
effect, than to furnish new incitements to diligence and <reg orig="fidel-|ity">fidelity</reg>, <lb/>
<pb n="10" entity="eaf033v5_0023" pid="uva-lib:350289"/>
in the promotion of an interest, which would then become, <lb/>
in a still higher degree than formerly, a common one. Mr. <lb/>
Dudley communicated his intention to Craig's mother, who, <lb/>
in addition to many grateful acknowledgments, stated that a <lb/>
kinsman of her son, had enabled him, in case of entering into <lb/>
partnership, to add a small sum to the common stock, and <lb/>
that, for this sum, Craig was authorized to draw upon a <reg orig="Lon-|don">London</reg> <lb/>
banker.</p>
<p>The proposed arrangement was speedily effected. Craig <lb/>
was charged with the management of all affairs, and Mr. <lb/>
Dudley retired to the enjoyment of still greater leisure. Two <lb/>
years elapsed, and nothing occurred to interrupt the harmony <lb/>
that subsisted between the partners. Mr. Dudley's condition <lb/>
might be esteemed prosperous. His wealth was constantly <lb/>
accumulating. He had nearly attained all that he wished, <lb/>
and his wishes still aimed at nothing less than splendid <reg orig="opu-|lence">opulence</reg>. <lb/>
He had annually increased the permanent sources of <lb/>
his revenue. His daughter was the only survivor of many <lb/>
children, who perished in their infancy, before habit and <reg orig="ma-|turity">maturity</reg> <lb/>
had rendered the parental tie difficult to break. This <lb/>
daughter had already exhibited proofs of a mind susceptible <lb/>
of high improvement, and the loveliness of her person <reg orig="prom-|ised">promised</reg> <lb/>
to keep pace with her mental acquisitions. He charged <lb/>
himself with the care of her education, and found no <reg orig="weari-|ness">weariness</reg> <lb/>
or satiety in this task that might not be amply relieved <lb/>
by the recreations of science and literature. He flattered <lb/>
himself that his career, which had hitherto been exempt from <lb/>
any considerable impediment, would terminate in tranquillity. <lb/>
Few men might, with more propriety, have discarded all <reg orig="ap-|prehensions">apprehensions</reg> <lb/>
respecting futurity.</p>
<p>Craig had several sisters and one brother, younger than <lb/>
himself. Mr. Dudley, desirous of promoting the happiness <lb/>
of this family, proposed to send for this brother, and have him <lb/>
educated to his own profession, insinuating to his partner that, <lb/>
at the time when the boy should have gained sufficient <reg orig="sta-|bility">stability</reg> <lb/>
and knowledge, he himself might be disposed to <reg orig="relin-|quish">relinquish</reg> <lb/>
the profession altogether, on terms particularly <reg orig="advan-|tageous">advantageous</reg> <lb/>
to the two brothers, who might thenceforth conduct <lb/>
their business jointly. Craig had been eloquent in praise of <lb/>
this lad, and his testimony had, from time to time, been <reg orig="con-|firmed">confirmed</reg> <lb/>
by that of his mother and sister. He had often <reg orig="ex-|pressed">expressed</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="11" entity="eaf033v5_0024" pid="uva-lib:350290"/>
his wishes for the prosperity of the lad, and when his <lb/>
mother had expressed her doubts as to the best method of <lb/>
disposing of him, modestly requested Mr. Dudley's advice <lb/>
on this head. The proposal, therefore, might be supposed <lb/>
to be particularly acceptable, and yet Craig expressed <reg orig="reluc-|tance">reluctance</reg> <lb/>
to concur with it. This reluctance was accompanied <lb/>
with certain tokens which sufficiently showed whence it arose. <lb/>
Craig appeared unwilling to increase those obligations under <lb/>
which he already labored. His sense of gratitude was too <lb/>
acute to allow him to heighten it by the reception of new <lb/>
benefits.</p>
<p>It might be imagined that this objection would be easily <lb/>
removed; but the obstinacy of Craig's opposition was <reg orig="invin-|cible">invincible</reg>. <lb/>
Mr. Dudley could not relinquish a scheme to which <lb/>
no stronger objection could be made. And, since his partner <lb/>
could not be prevailed upon to make this proposal to the <lb/>
friends of the lad, he was determined to do it himself. He <lb/>
maintained an intercourse by letters with several of those <lb/>
friends which he formed in his youth. One of them usually <lb/>
resided in London. From him he received about this time, a <lb/>
letter, in which, among other information, the writer <reg orig="mention-|ed">mentioned</reg> <lb/>
his intention of setting out on a tour through Yorkshire and <lb/>
the Scottish highlands. Mr. Dudley thought this a suitable <lb/>
opportunity for executing his design in favor of young Craig. <lb/>
He entertained no doubts about the worth and condition <lb/>
of this family, but was still desirous of obtaining some <reg orig="in-|formation">information</reg> <lb/>
on this head from one who would pass through <lb/>
this town where they resided, who would examine with his <lb/>
own eyes, and on whose discernment and integrity he could <lb/>
place an implicit reliance. He concealed this intention from <lb/>
his partner, and entrusted his letter to a friend who was just <lb/>
embarking for Europe. In due season he received an <reg orig="an-|swer">answer</reg>, <lb/>
confirming, in all respects, Craig's representations, but <lb/>
informing him that the lad had been lately disposed of in a <lb/>
way not equally advantageous with that which Mr. Dudley <lb/>
had proposed, but such as would not admit of change.</p>
<p>If doubts could possibly be entertained respecting the <reg orig="char-|acter">character</reg> <lb/>
and views of Craig, this evidence would have dispelled <lb/>
them. But plans however skilfully contrived, if founded on <lb/>
imposture, cannot fail of being sometimes detected. Craig <lb/>
had occasion to be absent from the city for some weeks. <lb/>
<pb n="12" entity="eaf033v5_0025" pid="uva-lib:350291"/>
Meanwhile a letter had been left at his lodgings by one who <lb/>
merely inquired if that were the dwelling of Mr. Dudley, <lb/>
and being answered by the servant in the affirmative, left the <lb/>
letter without farther parley. It was superscribed with a <lb/>
name unknown to any of the family, and in a hand which its <lb/>
badness rendered almost illegible. The servant placed it in <lb/>
a situation to be seen by his master.</p>
<p>Mr. Dudley allowed it to remain unopened for a <reg orig="consid-|erable">considerable</reg> <lb/>
time. At length, deeming it excusable to discover, <lb/>
by any means, the person to whom it was addressed, he <reg orig="ven-|tured">ventured</reg> <lb/>
to unseal it. It was dated at Portsmouth in <reg orig="New-|Hampshire">New-Hampshire</reg>. <lb/>
The signature was Mary Mansfield. It was <lb/>
addressed to her son, and was a curious specimen of <reg orig="illite-|rateness">illiterateness</reg>. <lb/>
Mary herself was unable to write, as she reminds <lb/>
her son, and had therefore procured the assistance of Mrs. <lb/>
Dewitt, for whose family she washed. The amanuensis was <lb/>
but little superior in the arts of penmanship to her principal. <lb/>
The contents of the epistle were made out with some <reg orig="diffi-|culty">difficulty</reg>. <lb/>
This was the substance of it.</p>
<p>Mary reproaches her son for deserting her, and letting five <lb/>
years pass away without allowing her to hear from him. She <lb/>
informed him of her distresses as they flowed from sickness <lb/>
and poverty, and were aggravated by the loss of her son who <lb/>
was so handsome and promising a lad. She related her <reg orig="mar-|riage">marriage</reg> <lb/>
with Zekel Hackney, who first brought her tidings of her <lb/>
boy. He was master, it seems, of a fishing smack, and <lb/>
voyaged sometimes to New-York. In one of his visits to this <lb/>
city, he met a mighty spry young man, in whom he thought <lb/>
he recognized his wife's son. He had traced him to the <lb/>
house of Mr. Dudley, and on inquiry, discovered that the <lb/>
lad resided here. On his return he communicated the <reg orig="tid-|ings">tidings</reg> <lb/>
to his spouse, who had now written to reproach him for <lb/>
his neglect of his poor old mother, and to intreat his <reg orig="assist-|ance">assistance</reg> <lb/>
to relieve her from the necessity of drudging for her <lb/>
livelihood.</p>
<p>This letter was capable of an obvious construction. It <lb/>
was, no doubt, founded in mistake, though, it was to be <reg orig="ac-|knowledged">acknowledged</reg>, <lb/>
that the mistake was singular. Such was the <lb/>
conclusion immediately formed by Mr. Dudley. He <reg orig="quiet-|ly">quietly</reg> <lb/>
replaced the letter on the mantelpiece, where it had <reg orig="be-|fore">before</reg> <lb/>
stood, and dismissed the affair from his thoughts.</p>
<pb n="13" entity="eaf033v5_0026" pid="uva-lib:350292"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">2</fw></pb>
<p>Next day Craig returned from his journey. Mr. Dudley <lb/>
was employed in examining some papers in a desk that stood <lb/>
behind the door, in the apartment in which the letter was <lb/>
placed. There was no other person in the room when <lb/>
Craig entered it. He did not perceive Mr. Dudley, who <lb/>
was screened from observation, by his silence and by an open <lb/>
door. As soon as he entered, Mr. Dudley looked at him, <lb/>
and made no haste to speak. The letter whose <reg orig="superscrip-|tion">superscription</reg> <lb/>
was turned towards him, immediately attracted Craig's <lb/>
attention. He seized it with some degree of eagerness, and <lb/>
observing the broken seal, thrust it hastily into his pocket, <lb/>
muttering, at the same time, in a tone, betokening a mixture <lb/>
of consternation and anger, "Damn it."&mdash;He immediately <lb/>
left the room, still uninformed of the presence of Mr. <reg orig="Dud-|ley">Dudley</reg>, <lb/>
who began to muse, with some earnestness, on what he <lb/>
had seen. Soon after he left this room and went into <reg orig="anoth-|er">another</reg>, <lb/>
in which the family usually sat. In about twenty <reg orig="min-|utes">minutes</reg>, <lb/>
Craig made his appearance with his usual freedom and <lb/>
plausibility. Complimentary and customary topics were <reg orig="dis-|cussed">discussed</reg>. <lb/>
Mrs. Dudley and her daughter were likewise <reg orig="pre-|sent">present</reg>. <lb/>
The uneasiness which the incident just mentioned had <lb/>
occasioned in the mind of Mr. Dudley, was at first dispelled <lb/>
by the disembarrassed behavior of his partner, but new <lb/>
matter of suspicion was speedily afforded him. He observed <lb/>
that his partner spoke of his present entrance as of the first <lb/>
since his arrival, and that when the lady mentioned that he <lb/>
had been the subject of a curious mistake, a letter being <reg orig="di-|rected">directed</reg> <lb/>
to him by a strange name, and left there during his <lb/>
absence, he pretended total ignorance of the circumstance. <lb/>
The young lady was immediately directed by her mother to <lb/>
bring the letter which lay, she said, on the mantel-tree in the <lb/>
next room.</p>
<p>During this scene Mr. Dudley was silent. He anticipated <lb/>
the disappointment of the messenger, believing the letter <lb/>
to have been removed. What then was his surprise when <lb/>
the messenger returned bearing the letter in her hand! Craig <lb/>
examined and read it, and commented, with great mirth, on <lb/>
the contents, acting, all the while, as if he had never seen it <lb/>
before. These appearances were not qualified to quiet <reg orig="sus-|picion">suspicion</reg>. <lb/>
The more Dudley brooded over them, the more <lb/>
<pb n="14" entity="eaf033v5_0027" pid="uva-lib:350293"/>
dissatisfied he became. He, however, concealed his thoughts <lb/>
as well from Craig himself as his family, impatiently waiting <lb/>
for some new occurrence to arise by which he might square <lb/>
his future proceedings.</p>
<p>During Craig's absence, Mrs. Dudley had thought this a <lb/>
proper occasion for cleaning his apartment. The furniture, <lb/>
and among the rest, a large chest strongly fastened, was <reg orig="re-|moved">removed</reg> <lb/>
into an adjoining room which was otherwise <reg orig="unoccu-|pied">unoccupied</reg>, <lb/>
and which was usually kept locked. When the <reg orig="clean-|sing">cleansing</reg> <lb/>
was finished, the furniture was replaced, except this <lb/>
trunk, which its bulk, the indolence of the servant, and her <lb/>
opinion of its uselessness, occasioned her to leave in the <lb/>
closet.</p>
<p>About a week after this, on a Saturday evening, Craig <lb/>
invited to sup with him a friend, who was to embark, on the <lb/>
ensuing Monday, for Jamaica. During supper, at which <lb/>
the family were present, the discourse turned on the voyage <lb/>
on which the guest was about to enter. In the course of talk, <lb/>
the stranger expressed how much he stood in need of a strong <lb/>
and commodious chest, in which he might safely deposit <lb/>
his clothes and papers. Not being apprized of the early <lb/>
departure of the vessel, he had deferred till it was too late, <lb/>
applying to an artisan.</p>
<p>Craig desired him to set himself at rest on that head, for <lb/>
that he had, in his possession, just such a trunk as he <reg orig="describ-|ed">described</reg>. <lb/>
It was of no use to him, being long filled with nothing <lb/>
better than refuse and lumber, and that, if he would, be <lb/>
might send for it the next morning. He turned to Mrs. <lb/>
Dudley and observed, that the trunk to which he alluded <lb/>
was in her possession, and he would thank her to direct its <lb/>
removal into his own apartment, that he might empty it of <lb/>
its present contents, and prepare it for the service of his <lb/>
friend. To this she readily assented.</p>
<p>There was nothing mysterious in this affair, but the mind <lb/>
of Mr. Dudley was pained with doubts. He was now as <lb/>
prone to suspect, as he was formerly disposed to confidence. <lb/>
This evening he put the key of the closet in his own pocket. <lb/>
When inquired for the next day, it was, of course, missing. <lb/>
It could not be found on the most diligent search. The <reg orig="oc-|casion">occasion</reg> <lb/>
was not of such moment as to justify breaking the <lb/>
door. Mr. Dudley imagined that he saw, in Craig, more <lb/>
<pb n="15" entity="eaf033v5_0028" pid="uva-lib:350294"/>
uneasiness at this disappointment, than he was willing to <reg orig="ex-|press">express</reg>. <lb/>
There was no remedy. The chest remained where <lb/>
it was, and, next morning, the ship departed on her voyage.</p>
<p>Craig accompanied his friend on board, was prevailed <reg orig="up-|on">upon</reg> <lb/>
to go to sea with him, designing to return with the <reg orig="pilot-|boat">pilotboat</reg>, <lb/>
but when the pilot was preparing to leave the vessel, <lb/>
such was this man's complaisance to the wishes of his friend, <lb/>
that he concluded to perform the remainder of the voyage <lb/>
in his company. The consequences are easily seen. Craig <lb/>
had gone with a resolution of never returning. The <reg orig="unhap-|py">unhappy</reg> <lb/>
Dudley was left to deplore the total ruin of his fortune <lb/>
which had fallen a prey to the arts of a subtle imposter.</p>
<p>The chest was opened, and the part which Craig had been <lb/>
playing for some years, with so much success, was perfectly <lb/>
explained. It appeared that the sum which Craig had <reg orig="con-|tributed">contributed</reg> <lb/>
to the common stock, when first admitted into <reg orig="part-|nership">partnership</reg>, <lb/>
had been previously purloined from the daily receipts <lb/>
of his shop, of which an exact register was kept. Craig <lb/>
had been so indiscreet as to preserve this accusing record, <lb/>
and it was discovered in this depository. He was the son of <lb/>
Mary Mansfield, and a native of Portsmouth. The history <lb/>
of the Wakefield family, specious and complicated as it was, <lb/>
was entirely fictitious. The letters had been forged, and the <lb/>
correspondence supported by his own dexterity. Here was <lb/>
found the letter which Mr. Dudley had written to his friend <lb/>
requesting him to make certain inquiries at Wakefield, and <lb/>
which he imagined that he had delivered with his own hands <lb/>
to a trusty bearer. Here was the original draught of the <reg orig="an-|swer">answer</reg> <lb/>
he received. The manner in which this stratagem had <lb/>
been accomplished came gradually to light. The letter <lb/>
which was written to the Yorkshire traveller had been <reg orig="pur-|loined">purloined</reg>, <lb/>
and another, with a similar superscription, in which <lb/>
the hand of Dudley was exactly imitated, and containing <lb/>
only brief and general remarks, had been placed in its stead. <lb/>
Craig must have suspected its contents, and by this suspicion <lb/>
have been incited to the theft. The answer which the <reg orig="Eng-|lishman">Englishman</reg> <lb/>
had really written, and which sufficiently <reg orig="corres-|ponded">corresponded</reg> <lb/>
with the forged letter, had been intercepted by Craig, <lb/>
and furnished him a model from which he might construct <lb/>
an answer adapted to his own purposes.</p>
<p>This imposture had not been sustained for a trivial <reg orig="pur-|pose">purpose</reg>. <lb/>
<pb n="16" entity="eaf033v5_0029" pid="uva-lib:350295"/>
He had embezzled a large share of the stock, and <lb/>
had employed the credit of the house to procure extensive <lb/>
remittances to be made to an agent at a distance, by whom <lb/>
the property was effectually secured. Craig had gone to <lb/>
participate these spoils, while the whole estate of Mr. <reg orig="Dud-|ley">Dudley</reg> <lb/>
was insufficient to pay the demands that were <reg orig="consequent-|ly">consequently</reg> <lb/>
made upon him.</p>
<p>It was his lot to fall into the grasp of men, who squared <lb/>
their actions by no other standard than law, and who <reg orig="esteem-|ed">esteemed</reg> <lb/>
every claim to be incontestibly just, that could plead that <lb/>
sanction. They did not indeed throw him into prison. <lb/>
When they had despoiled him of every remnant of his <reg orig="pro-|perty">property</reg>, <lb/>
they deemed themselves entitled to his gratitude for <lb/>
leaving his person unmolested.</p>

<head>CHAPTER II.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Thus</hi> in a moment was this man thrown from the summit <lb/>
of affluence to the lowest indigence. He had been <reg orig="habitu-|ated">habituated</reg> <lb/>
to independence and ease. This reverse, therefore, was <lb/>
the harder to bear. His present situation was much worse <lb/>
than at his father's death. Then he was sanguine with youth <lb/>
and glowing with health. He possessed a fund on which he <lb/>
could commence his operations. Materials were at hand, <lb/>
and nothing was wanted but skill to use them. Now he had <lb/>
advanced in life. His frame was not exempt from infirmity. <lb/>
He had so long reposed on the bosom of opulence and <reg orig="en-|joyed">enjoyed</reg> <lb/>
the respect attendant on wealth, that he felt himself <lb/>
totally incapacitated for a new station. His misfortune had <lb/>
not been foreseen. It was embittered by the consciousness <lb/>
of his own imprudence, and by recollecting that the serpent <lb/>
which had stung him, was nurtured in his own bosom.</p>
<p>It was not merely frugal fare and an humble dwelling to <lb/>
which he was condemned. The evils to be dreaded were <lb/>
beggary and contempt. Luxury and leisure were not <reg orig="mere-|ly">merely</reg> <lb/>
denied him. He must bend all his efforts to procure <lb/>
clothing and food, to preserve his family from nakedness <lb/>
and famine. His spirit would not brook dependence. To <lb/>
live upon charity, or to take advantage of the compassion of <lb/>
<pb n="17" entity="eaf033v5_0030" pid="uva-lib:350296"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">2*</fw></pb>
his friends, was a destiny far worse than any other. To this <lb/>
therefore he would not consent. However irksome and <lb/>
painful it might prove, he determined to procure his bread <lb/>
by the labor of his hands.</p>
<p>But to what scene or kind of employment should he <reg orig="be-|take">betake</reg> <lb/>
himself? He could not endure to exhibit this reverse of <lb/>
fortune on the same theatre which had witnessed his <reg orig="prosperi-|ty">prosperity</reg>. <lb/>
One of his first measures was to remove from New York <lb/>
to Philadelphia. How should he employ himself in his new <lb/>
abode? Painting, the art in which he was expert, would not <lb/>
afford him the means of subsistence. Though no despicable <lb/>
musician, he did not esteem himself qualified to be a <reg orig="teach-|er">teacher</reg> <lb/>
of this art. This profession, besides, was treated by his <lb/>
new neighbors, with general, though unmerited contempt. <lb/>
There were few things on which he prided himself more than <lb/>
on the facilities and elegancies of his penmanship. He was <lb/>
besides well acquainted with arithmetic and accompting. <lb/>
He concluded therefore, to offer his services as a writer in a <lb/>
public office. This employment demanded little bodily <reg orig="ex-|ertion">exertion</reg>. <lb/>
He had spent much of his time at the book and the <lb/>
desk; his new occupation, therefore, was further <reg orig="recommend-|ed">recommended</reg> <lb/>
by its resemblance to his ancient modes of life.</p>
<p>The first situation of this kind, for which he applied, he <lb/>
obtained. The duties were constant, but not otherwise <reg orig="toil-|some">toilsome</reg> <lb/>
or arduous. The emoluments were slender, but by <lb/>
contracting, within limits as narrow as possible, his expenses, <lb/>
they could be made subservient to the mere purposes of <reg orig="sub-|sistence">subsistence</reg>. <lb/>
He hired a small house in the suburbs of the city. <lb/>
It consisted of a room above and below, and a kitchen. <lb/>
His wife, daughter, and one girl, composed its inhabitants.</p>
<p>As long as his mind was occupied in projecting and <reg orig="execu-|ting">executing</reg> <lb/>
these arrangements, it was diverted from uneasy <reg orig="contem-|plations">contemplations</reg>. <lb/>
When his life became uniform, and day followed <lb/>
day in monotonous succession, and the novelty of his <reg orig="employ-|ment">employment</reg> <lb/>
had disappeared, his cheerfulness began likewise to <lb/>
fade, and was succeeded by unconquerable melancholy. <lb/>
His present condition was in every respect the contrast of his <lb/>
former. His servitude was intolerable. He was associated <lb/>
with sorded hirelings, gross and uneducated, who treated his <lb/>
age with rude familiarity, and insulted his ears with ribaldry <lb/>
<pb n="18" entity="eaf033v5_0031" pid="uva-lib:350297"/>
and scurril jests. He was subject to command, and had his <lb/>
portion of daily drudgery allotted to him, to be performed for <lb/>
a pittance no more than would buy the bread which he daily <lb/>
consumed. The task assigned him was technical and <reg orig="for-|mal">formal</reg>. <lb/>
He was perpetually encumbered with the rubbish of <lb/>
law, and waded with laborious steps through its endless <reg orig="tau-|tologies">tautologies</reg>, <lb/>
its impertinent circuities, its lying assertions, and <lb/>
hateful artifices. Nothing occurred to relieve or diversify the <lb/>
scene. It was one tedious round of scrawling and jargon; <lb/>
a tissue made up of the shreds and remnants of barbarous <lb/>
antiquity, polluted with the rust of ages, and patched by the <lb/>
stupidity of modern workmen, into new deformity.</p>
<p>When the day's task was finished, jaded spirits, and a <lb/>
body enfeebled by reluctant application, were but little <reg orig="adapt-|ed">adapted</reg> <lb/>
to domestic enjoyments. These indeed were <reg orig="incompati-|ble">incompatible</reg> <lb/>
with a temper like his, to whom the privation of the <lb/>
comforts that attended his former condition, was equivalent <lb/>
to the loss of life. These privations were still more painful <lb/>
to his wife, and her death added one more calamity to those <lb/>
under which he already groaned. He had always loved her <lb/>
with the tenderest affection, and he justly regarded this evil <lb/>
as surpassing all his former woes.</p>
<p>But his destiny seemed never weary of persecuting him. <lb/>
It was not enough that he should fall a victim to the most <reg orig="atro-|cious">atrocious</reg> <lb/>
arts, that he should wear out his days in solitude and <lb/>
drudgery, that he should feel not only the personal restraints <lb/>
and hardships attendant upon indigence, but the keener pangs <lb/>
that result from negligence and contumely. He was <reg orig="imper-|fectly">imperfectly</reg> <lb/>
recovered from the shock occasioned by the death of <lb/>
his wife, when his sight was invaded by a cataract. Its <reg orig="pro-|gress">progress</reg> <lb/>
was rapid, and terminated in total blindness.</p>
<p>He was now disabled from pursuing his usual occupation. <lb/>
He was shut out from the light of heaven, and debarred of <lb/>
every human comfort. Condemned to eternal dark, and <lb/>
worse than the helplessness of infancy, he was dependent for <lb/>
the meanest offices on the kindness of others, and he who had <lb/>
formerly abounded in the gifts of fortune, thought only of <lb/>
ending his days in a gaol or an almshouse.</p>
<p>His situation however was alleviated by one circumstance. <lb/>
He had a daughter, whom I have formerly mentioned, as the <lb/>
only survivor of many children. She was sixteen years of <lb/>
<pb n="19" entity="eaf033v5_0032" pid="uva-lib:350298"/>
age when the storm of adversity fell upon her father's house. <lb/>
It may be thought that one educated as she had been, in the <lb/>
gratification of all her wishes, and at an age of timidity and <lb/>
inexperience, would have been less fitted than her father for <lb/>
encountering misfortune; and yet, when the task of comforter <lb/>
fell upon her, her strength was not found wanting. Her <reg orig="for-|titude">fortitude</reg> <lb/>
was immediately put to the test. This reverse did not <lb/>
only affect her obliquely, and through the medium of her <lb/>
family, but directly, and in one way usually very distressful to <lb/>
female feelings.</p>
<p>Her fortune and character had attracted many admirers. <lb/>
One of them had some reason to flatter himself with success. <lb/>
Miss Dudley's notions had little in common with those around <lb/>
her. She had learned to square her conduct, in a <reg orig="consider-|able">considerable</reg> <lb/>
degree, not by the hasty impulses of inclination, but by <lb/>
the dictates of truth. She yielded nothing to caprice or <reg orig="pas-|sion">passion</reg>. <lb/>
Not that she was perfectly exempt from intervals of <lb/>
weakness, or from the necessity of painful struggles, but these <lb/>
intervals were transient, and these struggles always <reg orig="success-|ful">successful</reg>. <lb/>
She was no stranger to the pleadings of love, from the <lb/>
lips of others, and in her own bosom, but its tumults were <lb/>
brief, and speedily gave place to quiet thoughts and steadfast <lb/>
purposes.</p>
<p>She had listened to the solicitations of one, not unworthy <lb/>
in himself, and amply recommended by the circumstances of <lb/>
family and fortune. He was young, and therefore impetuous. <lb/>
Of the good that he sought, he was not willing to delay the <lb/>
acquisition for a moment. She had been taught a very <reg orig="dif-|ferent">different</reg> <lb/>
lesson. Marriage included vows of irrevocable <reg orig="affec-|tion">affection</reg> <lb/>
and obedience. It was a contract to endure for life. To <lb/>
form this connexion in extreme youth, before time had <reg orig="un-|folded">unfolded</reg> <lb/>
and modelled the characters of the parties, was, in her <lb/>
opinion, a proof of pernicious and opprobrious temerity. Not <lb/>
to perceive the propriety of delay in this case, or to be <reg orig="re-|gardless">regardless</reg> <lb/>
of the motives that would enjoin upon us a deliberate <lb/>
procedure, furnished an unanswerable objection to any man's <lb/>
pretensions. She was sensible, however, that this, like other <lb/>
mistakes, was curable. If her arguments failed to remove it, <lb/>
time, it was likely, would effect this purpose. If she rejected <lb/>
a matrimonial proposal for the present, it was for reasons <lb/>
that might not preclude her future acceptance of it.</p>
<pb n="20" entity="eaf033v5_0033" pid="uva-lib:350299"/>
<p>Her scruples, in the present case, did not relate to the <reg orig="tem-|per">temper</reg>, <lb/>
or person, or understanding of her lover, but to his age, to <lb/>
the imperfectness of their acquaintance, and to the want of that <lb/>
permanence of character which can flow only from the <reg orig="pro-|gress">progress</reg> <lb/>
of time and knowledge. These objections, which so <lb/>
rarely exist, were conclusive with her. There was no danger <lb/>
of her relinquishing them in compliance with the remonstrances <lb/>
of parents and the solicitations of her lover, though the one <lb/>
and the other were urged with all the force of authority and <lb/>
insinuation. The prescriptions of duty were too clear to <lb/>
allow her to hesitate and waver, but the consciousness of <reg orig="rec-|titude">rectitude</reg> <lb/>
could not secure her from temporary vexations.</p>
<p>Her parents were blemished with some of the frailties of <lb/>
that character. They held themselves entitled to prescribe <lb/>
in this article, but they forbore to exert their power. They <lb/>
condescended to persuade, but it was manifest, that they <reg orig="re-|garded">regarded</reg> <lb/>
their own conduct as a relaxation of right; and, had <lb/>
not the lover's importunities suddenly ceased, it is not <reg orig="possi-|ble">possible</reg> <lb/>
to tell how far the happiness of Miss Dudley might have <lb/>
been endangered. The misfortunes of her father were no <lb/>
sooner publicly known, than the youth forbore his visits, and <lb/>
embarked on a voyage which he had long projected, but <lb/>
which had been hitherto delayed by a superior regard to the <lb/>
interests of his passion.</p>
<p>It must be allowed that the lady had not foreseen this <lb/>
event. She had exercised her judgment upon his <reg orig="charac-|ter">character</reg>, <lb/>
and had not been deceived. Before this desertion, had <lb/>
it been clearly stated to her apprehension, she would have <lb/>
readily admitted it to be probable. She knew the fascination <lb/>
of wealth, and the delusiveness of self-confidence. She was <lb/>
superior to the folly of supposing him exempt from sinister <lb/>
influences, and deaf to the whispers of ambition, and yet the <lb/>
manner in which she was affected by this event, convinced <lb/>
her that her heart had a larger share than her reason in <reg orig="dic-|tating">dictating</reg> <lb/>
her expectations.</p>
<p>Yet it must not be supposed that she suffered any very <lb/>
acute distress on this account. She was grieved less for her <lb/>
own sake than his. She had no design of entering into <reg orig="mar-|riage">marriage</reg>, <lb/>
in less than seven years from this period. Not a single <lb/>
hope, relative to her own condition, had been frustrated. <lb/>
She had only been mistaken in her favorable conceptions of <lb/>
<pb n="21" entity="eaf033v5_0034" pid="uva-lib:350300"/>
another. He had exhibited less constancy and virtue than <lb/>
her heart had taught her to expect.</p>
<p>With those opinions, she could devote herself, with a single <lb/>
heart, to the alleviation of her parents' sorrows. This change <lb/>
in her condition she treated lightly, and retained her <reg orig="cheer-|fulness">cheerfulness</reg> <lb/>
unimpaired. This happened because, in a rational <lb/>
estimate, and so far as it affected herself, the misfortune was <lb/>
slight, and because her dejection would only tend to augment <lb/>
the disconsolateness of her parents, while, on the other hand, <lb/>
her serenity was calculated to infuse the same confidence into <lb/>
them. She indulged herself in no fits of exclamation or <lb/>
moodiness. She listened in silence to their invectives and <lb/>
laments, and seized every opportunity that offered to inspire <lb/>
them with courage, to set before them the good, as well as ill, <lb/>
to which they were reserved, to suggest expedients for <reg orig="im-|proving">improving</reg> <lb/>
their condition, and to soften the asperities of his new <lb/>
mode of life, to her father, by every species of blandishment <lb/>
and tenderness.</p>
<p>She refused no personal exertion to the common benefit. <lb/>
She incited her father to diligence, as well by her example, <lb/>
as by her exhortations; suggested plans, and superintended <lb/>
or assisted in the execution of them. The infirmities of sex <lb/>
and age vanished before the motives to courage and activity <lb/>
flowing from her new situation. When settled in his new <lb/>
abode, and profession, she began to deliberate what conduct <lb/>
was incumbent on herself, how she might participate, with her <lb/>
father, the burthen of the common maintenance, and blunt <lb/>
the edge of this calamity by the resources of a powerful and <lb/>
cultivated mind.</p>
<p>In the first place, she disposed of every superfluous garb <lb/>
and trinket. She reduced her wardrobe to the plainest and <lb/>
cheapest establishment. By this means alone, she supplied <lb/>
her father's necessities with a considerable sum. Her music <lb/>
and even her books were not spared, not from the slight <lb/>
esteem in which these were held by her, but because she was <lb/>
thenceforth to become an economist of time as well as of <lb/>
money, because musical instruments are not necessary to the <lb/>
practice of this art in its highest perfection, and because, <lb/>
books, when she should procure leisure to read, or money to <lb/>
purchase them, might be obtained in a cheaper and more <lb/>
commodious form, than those costly and splendid volumes, <lb/>
<pb n="22" entity="eaf033v5_0035" pid="uva-lib:350301"/>
with which her father's munificence had formerly supplied <lb/>
her.</p>
<p>To make her expenses as limited as possible, was her next <lb/>
care. For this end she assumed the province of cook, the <lb/>
washing of house and clothes, and the cleansing of <reg orig="furni-|ture">furniture</reg>. <lb/>
Their house was small, the family consisted of no <lb/>
more than four persons, and all formality and expensiveness <lb/>
were studiously discarded, but her strength was unequal to <lb/>
unavoidable tasks. A vigorous constitution could not <reg orig="sup-|ply">supply</reg> <lb/>
the place of laborious habits, and this part of her plan <lb/>
must have been changed for one less frugal. The aid of a <lb/>
servant must have been hired, if it had not been furnished <lb/>
by gratitude.</p>
<p>Some years before this misfortune, her mother had taken <lb/>
under her protection a girl, the daughter of a poor woman, <lb/>
who subsisted by labour, and who dying, left this child <reg orig="with-|out">without</reg> <lb/>
friend or protector. This girl possessed no very <reg orig="im-|provable">improvable</reg> <lb/>
capacity, and therefore, could not benefit by the <lb/>
benevolent exertions of her young mistress as much as the <lb/>
latter desired, but her temper was artless and affectionate, <lb/>
and she attached herself to Constantia with the most entire <lb/>
devotion. In this change of fortune she would not consent <lb/>
to be separated, and Miss Dudley, influenced by her <reg orig="affec-|tion">affection</reg> <lb/>
to her Lucy, and reflecting that on the whole it was <lb/>
most to her advantage to share with her, at once, her <reg orig="kind-|ness">kindness</reg> <lb/>
and her poverty, retained her as her companion. With <lb/>
this girl she shared the domestic duties, scrupling not to <lb/>
divide with her the meanest and most rugged, as well as the <lb/>
lightest offices.</p>
<p>This was not all. She, in the next place, considered <lb/>
whether her ability extended no farther than to save. Could <lb/>
she not by the employment of her hands increase the <reg orig="in-|come">income</reg> <lb/>
as well as diminish the expense? Why should she <lb/>
be precluded from all lucrative occupation? She soon <lb/>
came to a resolution. She was mistress of her needle, and <lb/>
this skill she conceived herself bound to employ for her own <lb/>
subsistence.</p>
<p>Clothing is one of the necessaries of human existence. <lb/>
The art of the tailor is scarcely of less use than that of <lb/>
the tiller of the ground. There are few the gains of which <lb/>
are better merited, and less injurious to the principles of <reg orig="hu-|man">human</reg> <lb/>

society. She resolved therefore to become a <reg orig="workwo-|man">workwoman</reg>, <lb/>
and to employ in this way, the leisure she possessed <lb/>
from household avocations. To this scheme she was obliged <lb/>
to reconcile not only herself but her parents. The <reg orig="con-|quest">conquest</reg> <lb/>
of their prejudices was no easy task, but her patience <lb/>
and skill finally succeeded, and she procured needle work <lb/>
in sufficient quantity to enable her to enhance in no trivial <lb/>
degree, the common fund.</p>
<p>It is one thing barely to comply with the urgencies of the <lb/>
case, and to do that which, in necessitous circumstances is <lb/>
best. But to conform with grace and cheerfulness, to yield <lb/>
no place to fruitless recriminations and repinings, to contract <lb/>
the evils into as small a compass as possible, and extract <lb/>
from our condition all possible good, is a task of a different <lb/>
kind.</p>
<p>Mr. Dudley's situation required from him frugality and <lb/>
diligence. He was regular and unintermitted in his <reg orig="appli-|cation">application</reg> <lb/>
to his pen. He was frugal. His slender income was <lb/>
administered agreeably to the maxims of his daughter; but <lb/>
he was unhappy. He experienced in its full extent the <lb/>
bitterness of disappointment.</p>
<p>He gave himself up for the most part to a listless <reg orig="melan-|choly">melancholy</reg>. <lb/>
Sometimes his impatience would produce effects <lb/>
less excusable; and conjure up an accusing and irascible <lb/>
spirit. His wife and even his daughter he would make the <lb/>
objects of peevish and absurd reproaches. These were <lb/>
moments when her heart drooped indeed, and her tears <lb/>
could not be restrained from flowing. These fits were <lb/>
transitory and rare, and when they had passed, the father <lb/>
seldom failed to mingle tokens of contrition and repentance <lb/>
with the tears of his daughter. Her arguments and <reg orig="sooth-|ings">soothings</reg> <lb/>
were seldom disappointed of success. Her mother's <lb/>
disposition was soft and pliant, but she could not <reg orig="accommo-|date">accommodate</reg> <lb/>
herself to the necessity of her husband's affairs. She <lb/>
was obliged to endure the want of some indulgences, but <lb/>
she reserved to herself the liberty of complaining, and to <lb/>
subdue this spirit in her was found utterly impracticable. <lb/>
She died a victim to discontent.</p>
<p>This event deepened the gloom that shrouded the soul <lb/>
of her father, and rendered the task of consolation still more <lb/>
difficult. She did not despair. Her sweetness and patience <lb/>
<pb n="24" entity="eaf033v5_0037" pid="uva-lib:350303"/>
was invincible by any thing that had already happened, but <lb/>
her fortitude did not exceed the standard of human nature. <lb/>
Evils now began to menace her, to which it is likely she <lb/>
would have yielded, had not their approach been intercepted <lb/>
by an evil of a different kind.</p>
<p>The pressure of grief is sometimes such as to prompt us <lb/>
to seek a refuge in voluntary death. We must lay aside the <lb/>
burthen which we cannot sustain. If thought degenerate <lb/>
into a vehicle of pain, what remains but to destroy that <lb/>
vehicle? For this end, death is the obvious, but not the <lb/>
only, or morally speaking, the worst means. There is one <lb/>
method of obtaining the bliss of forgetfulness, in comparison <lb/>
with which suicide is innocent.</p>
<p>The strongest mind is swayed by circumstances. There <lb/>
is no firmness of integrity, perhaps, able to repel every <lb/>
species of temptation, which is produced by the present <lb/>
constitution of human affairs, and yet temptation is <reg orig="success-|ful">successful</reg>, <lb/>
chiefly by virtue of its gradual and invisible approaches. <lb/>
We rush into danger, because we are not aware of its <reg orig="ex-|istence">existence</reg>, <lb/>
and have not therefore provided the means of safety, <lb/>
and the d&aelig;mon that seizes us is hourly reinforced by habit. <lb/>
Our opposition grows fainter in proportion as our adversary <lb/>
acquires new strength, and the man becomes enslaved by <lb/>
the most sordid vices, whose fall would, at a former period, <lb/>
have been deemed impossible, or who would have been <reg orig="im-|agined">imagined</reg> <lb/>
liable to any species of depravity, more than to this.</p>
<p>Mr. Dudley's education had entailed upon him many <lb/>
errors, yet who would have supposed it possible for him to <lb/>
be enslaved by a depraved appetite; to be enamoured of <lb/>
low debauchery, and to grasp at the happiness that <reg orig="intoxi-|cation">intoxication</reg> <lb/>
had to bestow? This was a mournful period in <lb/>
Constantia's history. My feelings will not suffer me to <lb/>
dwell upon it. I cannot describe the manner in which <lb/>
she was affected by the first symptoms of this depravity, the <lb/>
struggles which she made to counteract this dreadful <reg orig="infatu-|ation">infatuation</reg>, <lb/>
and the grief which she experienced from the <reg orig="repeat-|ed">repeated</reg> <lb/>
miscarriage of her efforts. I will not detail her various <lb/>
expedients for this end, the appeals which she made to his <lb/>
understanding, to his sense of honor and dread of infamy, <lb/>
to the gratitude to which she was entitled, and to the <reg orig="injunc-|tions">injunctions</reg> <lb/>
of parental duty. I will not detail his fits of remorse, <lb/>
<pb n="25" entity="eaf033v5_0038" pid="uva-lib:350304"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">3</fw></pb>
his fruitless penitence, and continual relapses, nor depict the <lb/>
heart-breaking scenes of uproar and violence, and foul <reg orig="dis-|grace">disgrace</reg> <lb/>
that accompained his paroxysms of drunkenness.</p>
<p>The only intellectual amusement which this lady allowed <lb/>
herself was writing. She enjoyed one distant friend, with <lb/>
whom she maintained an uninterrupted correspondence, and <lb/>
to whom she confided a circumstantial and copious relation <lb/>
of all these particulars. That friend is the writer of these <lb/>
memoirs. It is not impossible but that these letters may be <lb/>
communicated to the world, at some future period. The <lb/>
picture which they exhibit is hourly exemplified and realized, <lb/>
though, in the many colored scenes of human life, none <lb/>
surpasses it in disastrousness and horror. My eyes almost <lb/>
wept themselves dry over this part of her tale.</p>
<p>In this state of things Mr. Dudley's blindness might justly <lb/>
be accounted, even in its immediate effects, a fortunate event. <lb/>
It dissolved the spell, by which he was bound, and which, <lb/>
it is probable, would never have been otherwise broken. <lb/>
It restored him to himself and showed him, with a <reg orig="distinct-|ness">distinctness</reg> <lb/>
which made him shudder, the gulf to which he was <lb/>
hastening. But nothing can compensate to the sufferer the <lb/>
evils of blindness. It was the business of Constantia's life <lb/>
to alleviate those sufferings, to cherish and console her father, <lb/>
and to rescue him, by the labor of her hands from <reg orig="de-|pendence">dependence</reg> <lb/>
on public charity. For this end, her industry and <lb/>
solicitude were never at rest. She was able, by that <reg orig="indus-|try">industry</reg>, <lb/>
to provide him and herself with necessaries. Their <lb/>
portion was scanty, and, if it sometimes exceeded the <reg orig="stand-|ard">standard</reg> <lb/>
of their wants, not less frequently fell short of it. For <lb/>
all her toils and disquietudes she esteemed herself fully <reg orig="com-|pensated">compensated</reg> <lb/>
by the smiles of her father. He indeed could <reg orig="sel-|dom">seldom</reg> <lb/>
be prompted to smile, or to suppress the dictates of <lb/>
that despair which flowed from his sense of this new calamity, <lb/>
and the aggravations of hardship, which his recent insobrieties <lb/>
had occasioned to his daughter.</p>
<p>She purchased what books her scanty stock would allow, <lb/>
and borrowed others. These she read to him when her <lb/>
engagements would permit. At other times she was <reg orig="accus-|tomed">accustomed</reg> <lb/>
to solace herself with her own music. The lute <lb/>
which her father had purchased in Italy, and which had <lb/>
<pb n="26" entity="eaf033v5_0039" pid="uva-lib:350305"/>
been disposed of among the rest of his effects, at public <lb/>
sale, had been gratuitously restored to him by the purchaser, <lb/>
on condition of his retaining it in his possession. His <reg orig="blind-|ness">blindness</reg> <lb/>
and inoccupation now broke the long silence to which <lb/>
this instrument had been condemned, and afforded an <reg orig="ac-|companiment">accompaniment</reg> <lb/>
to the young lady's voice.</p>
<p>Her chief employment was conversation. She resorted <lb/>
to this as the best means of breaking the monotony of the <lb/>
scene; but this purpose was not only accomplished, but <reg orig="oth-|er">other</reg> <lb/>
benefits of the highest value accrued from it. The <reg orig="hab-|its">habits</reg> <lb/>
of a painter eminently tended to vivify and make exact <lb/>
her father's conceptions and delineations of visible objects. <lb/>
The sphere of his youthful observation comprised more <reg orig="in-|gredients">ingredients</reg> <lb/>
of the picturesque, than any other sphere. The <lb/>
most precious materials of the moral history of mankind, are <lb/>
derived from the revolutions of Italy. Italian features and <lb/>
landscape constitute the chosen field of the artist. No one <lb/>
had more carefully explored this field than Mr. Dudley. <lb/>
His time, when abroad, had been divided between residence <lb/>
at Rome, and excursions to Calabria and Tuscany. Few <lb/>
impressions were effaced from his capacious register, and <lb/>
these were now rendered by his eloquence, nearly as <reg orig="con-|spicuous">conspicuous</reg> <lb/>
to his companion as to himself.</p>
<p>She was imbued with an ardent thirst of knowledge, and <lb/>
by the acuteness of her remarks, and the judiciousness of <lb/>
her inquiries, reflected back upon his understanding as much <lb/>
improvement as she received. These efforts to render his <lb/>
calamity tolerable, and inure him to the profiting by his own <lb/>
resources, were aided by time, and, when reconciled by <lb/>
habit to unrespited gloom, he was, sometimes, visited by <lb/>
gleams of cheerfulness, and drew advantageous comparisons <lb/>
between his present and former situation. A stillness not <reg orig="un-|akin">unakin</reg> <lb/>
to happiness, frequently diffused itself over their winter <lb/>
evenings. Constantia enjoyed, in their full extent, the <reg orig="felic-|ities">felicities</reg> <lb/>
of health and self-approbation. The genius and <reg orig="elo-|quence">eloquence</reg> <lb/>
of her father, nourished by perpetual exercise, and <lb/>
undiverted from its purpose by the intrusion of visible objects, <lb/>
frequently afforded her a delight in comparison with which <lb/>
all other pleasures were mean.</p>

<head>CHAPTER III.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">This</hi> period of tranquillity was short. Poverty hovered <lb/>
at their threshold, and in a state precarious as their's, could <lb/>
not be long excluded. The lady was more accustomed to <lb/>
anticipate good than evil, but she was not unconscious that <lb/>
the winter, which was hastening, would bring with it <reg orig="nume-|rous">numerous</reg> <lb/>
inconveniences. Wants during that season are <reg orig="multi-|plied">multiplied</reg>, <lb/>
while the means of supplying them either fail or are <lb/>
diminished. Fuel is alone, a cause of expense equal to all <lb/>
other articles of subsistence. Her dwelling was old, crazy, <lb/>
and full of avenues to air. It was evident that neither fire <lb/>
nor clothing would, in an habitation like that, attemper the <lb/>
chilling blasts. Her scanty gains were equal to their needs, <lb/>
during summer, but would probably fall short during the <reg orig="pre-|valence">prevalence</reg> <lb/>
of cold.</p>
<p>These reflections could not fail sometimes to intrude. <lb/>
She indulged them as long as they served merely to suggest <lb/>
expedients and provisions for the future, but labored to call <lb/>
away her attention when they merely produced anxiety. <lb/>
This she more easily effected, as some months of summer <lb/>
were still to come, and her knowledge of the vicissitudes to <lb/>
which human life is subject, taught her to rely upon the <lb/>
occurrence of some fortunate, though unforeseen event.</p>
<p>Accident suggested an expedient of this kind. Passing <lb/>
through an alley, in the upper part of the town, her eye was <lb/>
caught by a label on the door of a small house, signifying <lb/>
that it was to be let. It was smaller than that she at present <lb/>
occupied, but it had an aspect of much greater comfort and <lb/>
neatness. Its situation, near the centre of the city, in a <lb/>
quiet, cleanly, and well paved alley, was far preferable to <lb/>
that of her present habitation, in the suburbs, scarcely <reg orig="ac-|cessible">accessible</reg> <lb/>
in winter, for pools and gulleys, and in a <reg orig="neigh-|borhood">neighborhood</reg> <lb/>
abounding with indigence and profligacy. She <reg orig="like-|wise">likewise</reg> <lb/>
considered that the rent of this might be less, and that <lb/>
the proprietor of this might have more forbearance and <lb/>
benignity than she had hitherto met with.</p>
<p>Unconversant as she was with the world, imbued with the <lb/>
timidity of her sex and her youth, many enterprises were <lb/>
arduous to her, which would, to age and experience, have <lb/>
<pb n="28" entity="eaf033v5_0041" pid="uva-lib:350307"/>
been easy. Her reluctances, however, when required by <lb/>
necessity, were overcome, and all the measures which her <lb/>
situation prescribed, executed with address and despatch. <lb/>
One, marking her deportment, would have perceived nothing <lb/>
but dignity and courage. He would have regarded these <lb/>
as the fruits of habitual independence and exertion, whereas <lb/>
they were merely the results of clear perceptions and <reg orig="inflexi-|ble">inflexible</reg> <lb/>
resolves.</p>
<p>The proprietor of this mansion was immediately sought <lb/>
out, and a bargain, favorable as she could reasonably desire, <lb/>
concluded. Possession was to be taken in a week. For <lb/>
this end carters and draymen were to be engaged, household <lb/>
implements to be prepared for removal, and negligence and <lb/>
knavery prevented by scrupulous attention. The duties of <lb/>
superintendence and execution devolved upon her. Her <lb/>
father's blindness rendered him powerless. His personal <lb/>
ease required no small portion of care. Household and <lb/>
professional functions were not to be omitted. She stood <lb/>
alone in the world. There was none whose services or <lb/>
counsel she could claim. Tortured by multiplicity of cares, <lb/>
shrinking from exposure to rude eyes, and from contention <lb/>
with refractory and insolent spirits, and overpowered with <lb/>
fatigue and disgust, she was yet compelled to retain a <reg orig="cheer-|ful">cheerful</reg> <lb/>
tone in her father's presence, and to struggle with his <lb/>
regrets and his peevishness.</p>
<p>O my friend! Methinks I now see thee, encountering the <lb/>
sneers and obstinacy of the meanest of mankind, subjecting <lb/>
that frame of thine, so exquisitely delicate, and therefore so <lb/>
feeble, to the vilest drudgery. I see thee, leading thy <reg orig="un-|happy">unhappy</reg> <lb/>
father to his new dwelling, and stifling the sighs <reg orig="pro-|duced">produced</reg> <lb/>
by his fruitless repinings and unseasonable scruples&mdash; <lb/>
Why was I not partaker of thy cares and labors? Why <lb/>
was I severed from thee by the ocean, and kept in ignorance <lb/>
of thy state? I was not without motives to anxiety, for I <lb/>
was friendless as thou, but how unlike to thine was my <reg orig="con-|dition">condition</reg>! <lb/>
I reposed upon down and tissue, never moved but <lb/>
with obsequious attendance and pompous equipage, painting <lb/>
and music were consolations ever at hand, and my cabinet <lb/>
was stored with poetry and science. These, indeed, were <lb/>
insufficient to exclude care, and with regard to the past, I <lb/>
have no wish but that I had shared with my friend her <reg orig="toil-|some">toilsome</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="29" entity="eaf033v5_0042" pid="uva-lib:350308"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">3*</fw></pb>
and humiliating lot. However an erroneous world <lb/>
might judge, thy life was full of dignity, and thy moments of <lb/>
happiness not few, since happiness is only attendant on the <lb/>
performance of our duty.</p>
<p>A toilsome and sultry week was terminated by a sabbath <lb/>
of repose. Her new dwelling possessed indisputable <reg orig="ad-|vantages">advantages</reg> <lb/>
over her old. Not the least of these benefits <lb/>
consisted in the vicinity of people, peaceable and honest, <lb/>
though poor. She was no longer shocked by the clamors <lb/>
of debauchery, and exposed, by her situation, to the danger <lb/>
of being mistaken by the profligate of either sex, for one of <lb/>
their own class. It was reasonable to consider this change <lb/>
of abode, as fortunate, and yet, circumstances quickly <reg orig="oc-|curred">occurred</reg> <lb/>
which suggested a very different conclusion.</p>
<p>She had no intercourse, which necessity did not prescribe, <lb/>
with the rest of the world. She screened herself as much <lb/>
as possible from intercourse with prying and loquacious <lb/>
neighbors. Her father's inclination in this respect coincided <lb/>
with her own, though their love of seclusion was prompted <lb/>
by different motives. Visitants were hated by the father, <lb/>
because his dignity was hurt by communication with the <lb/>
vulgar. The daughter set too much value upon time <reg orig="wil-|lingly">willingly</reg> <lb/>
to waste it upon trifles and triflers. She had no pride <lb/>
to subdue, and therefore never escaped from well meant <lb/>
importunity at the expense of politeness and good humor. <lb/>
In her moments of leisure, she betook herself to the poet <lb/>
and the moralist for relief.</p>
<p>She could not at all times, suppress the consciousness of <lb/>
the evils which surrounded and threatened her. She could <lb/>
not but rightly estimate the absorbing and brutifying nature <lb/>
of that toil to which she was condemned. Literature had <lb/>
hitherto been regarded as her solace. She knew that <reg orig="medi-|tation">meditation</reg> <lb/>
and converse as well as books and the pen, are <reg orig="instru-|ments">instruments</reg> <lb/>
of knowledge, but her musing thoughts were too often <lb/>
fixed upon her own condition. Her father's soaring moods <lb/>
and luminous intervals grew less frequent. Conversation <lb/>
was too rarely abstracted from personal considerations, and <lb/>
strayed less often than before into the wilds of fancy or the <lb/>
mazes of analysis.</p>
<pb n="30" entity="eaf033v5_0043" pid="uva-lib:350309"/>
<p>These circumstances led her to reflect whether <reg orig="subsis-|tence">subsistence</reg> <lb/>
might not be obtained by occupations purely <reg orig="intellect-|ual">intellectual</reg>. <lb/>
Instruction was needed by the young of both sexes. <lb/>
Females frequently performed the office of teachers. Was <lb/>
there no branch of her present knowledge which she might <lb/>
claim wages for imparting to others? Was there no art <lb/>
within her reach to acquire, convertible into means of gain? <lb/>
Women are generally limited to what is sensual and <reg orig="orna-|mental">ornamental</reg>. <lb/>
Music and painting, and the Italian and French <lb/>
languages, are bounds which they seldom pass. In these <lb/>
pursuits it is not possible, nor is it expected, that they should <lb/>
arrive at the skill of adepts. The education of Constantia <lb/>
had been regulated by the peculiar views of her father, who <lb/>
sought to make her, not alluring and voluptuous, but eloquent <lb/>
and wise. He therefore limited her studies to Latin and <lb/>
English. Instead of familiarizing her with the amorous <lb/>
effusions of Petrarcha and Racine, he made her thoroughly <lb/>
conversant with Tacitus and Milton. Instead of making her <lb/>
a practical musician or pencilist, he conducted her to the <lb/>
school of Newton and Hartley, unveiled to her the <reg orig="mathe-|matical">mathematical</reg> <lb/>
properties of light and sound, taught her as a <reg orig="meta-|physician">metaphysician</reg> <lb/>
and anatomist, the structure and power of the <lb/>
senses, and discussed with her the principles and progress <lb/>
of human society.</p>
<p>These accomplishments tended to render her superior to <lb/>
the rest of women, but in no degree qualified her for the <lb/>
post of a female instructer. She saw and lamented her <lb/>
deficiencies, and gradually formed the resolution of <reg orig="supply-|ing">supplying</reg> <lb/>
them. Her knowledge of the Latin tongue and of <lb/>
grammatical principles, rendered easy the acquisition of <lb/>
Italian and French, these being merely scions from the <lb/>
Roman stock.</p>
<p>Having had occasion, previous to her change of dwelling, <lb/>
to purchase paper at a bookseller's, the man had offered her <lb/>
at a very low price, a second-hand copy of Veneroni's <reg orig="gram-|mar">grammar</reg>. <lb/>
The offer had been declined, her views at that time <lb/>
being otherwise directed. Now, however, this incident was <lb/>
remembered, and a resolution instantly formed to purchase <lb/>
the book. As soon as the light declined, and her daily task <lb/>
at the needle had drawn to a close, she set out to execute <lb/>
this purpose. Arriving at the house of the bookseller, she <lb/>
<pb n="31" entity="eaf033v5_0044" pid="uva-lib:350310"/>
perceived that the doors and windows were closed. Night <lb/>
having not yet arrived, the conjecture easily occurred, that <lb/>
some one had died in the house. She had always dealt with <lb/>
this man for books and paper, and had always been treated <lb/>
with civility. Her heart readily admitted some sympathy <lb/>
with his distress, and to remove her doubts, she turned to a <lb/>
person who stood at the entrance of the next house, and who <lb/>
held a cloth steeped in vinegar to his nostrils. In reply to <lb/>
her question, the stranger said in a tone of the deepest <reg orig="con-|sternation&mdash;Mr">consternation&mdash;Mr</reg>. <lb/>
Watson do you mean? He is dead; he <lb/>
died last night of the <hi rend="italic">yellow fever.</hi></p>
<p>The name of this disease was not absolutely new to her <lb/>
ears. She had been apprised of its rapid and destructive <lb/>
progress in one quarter of the city, but, hitherto, it had <reg orig="exist-|ed">existed</reg>, <lb/>
with regard to her, chiefly in the form of rumor. She <lb/>
had not realized the nature or probable extent of the evil. <lb/>
She lived at no great distance from the seat of the malady, <lb/>
but her neighborhood had been hitherto exempt. So <reg orig="whol-|ly">wholly</reg> <lb/>
unused was she to contemplate pestilence, except at a <lb/>
distance, that its actual existence in the bosom of this city <lb/>
was incredible.</p>
<p>Contagious diseases, she well knew, periodically visited <lb/>
and laid waste the Greek and Egyptian cities. It constituted <lb/>
no small part of that mass of evil, political and physical, by <lb/>
which that portion of the world has been so long afflicted. <lb/>
That a pest equally malignant had assailed the metropolis of <lb/>
her own country, a town famous for the salubrity of its airs <lb/>
and the perfection of its police, had something in it so wild <lb/>
and uncouth, that she could not reconcile herself to the <reg orig="pos-|sibility">possibility</reg> <lb/>
of such an event.</p>
<p>The death of Watson, however, filled her mind with <reg orig="aw-|ful">awful</reg> <lb/>
reflections. The purpose of her walk was forgotten <lb/>
amidst more momentous considerations. She bent her steps <lb/>
pensively homeward. She had now leisure to remark the <lb/>
symptoms of terror with which all ranks appeared to have <lb/>
been seized. The streets were as much frequented as ever, <lb/>
but there were few passengers whose countenances did not <lb/>
betray alarm, and who did not employ the imaginary <reg orig="anti-|dote">antidote</reg> <lb/>
to infection, vinegar.</p>
<p>Having reached home, she quickly discovered in her <reg orig="fa-|ther">father</reg>, <lb/>
an unusual solemnity and thoughtfulness. He had no <lb/>
<pb n="32" entity="eaf033v5_0045" pid="uva-lib:350311"/>
power to conceal his emotions from his daughter, when her <lb/>
efforts to discover them were earnestly exerted. She <reg orig="learn-|ed">learned</reg> <lb/>
that, during her absence he had been visited by his next <lb/>
neighbor, a thrifty, sober and well meaning, but ignorant and <lb/>
meddling person, by name Whiston. This person, being <lb/>
equally inquisitive into other men's affairs, and communicative <lb/>
of his own, was always an unwelcome visitant. On this <reg orig="occa-|sion">occasion</reg>, <lb/>
he had come to disburthen on Mr. Dudley his fears of <lb/>
disease and death. His tale of the origin and progress of <lb/>
the epidemic, of the number and suddenness of recent deaths, <lb/>
was delivered with endless prolixity. With this account be <lb/>
mingled prognostics of the future, counselled Mr. Dudley to <lb/>
fly from the scene of danger, and stated his own schemes <lb/>
and resolutions. After having thoroughly affrighted and <lb/>
wearied his companion, he took his leave.</p>
<p>Constantia endeavored to remove the impression which <lb/>
had been thus needlessly made. She urged her doubts as <lb/>
to the truth of Whiston's representations, and endeavored, <lb/>
in various ways, to extenuate the danger.</p>
<p>Nay, my child, said her father, thou needest not reason <lb/>
on the subject. I am not afraid. At least, on my own <reg orig="ac-|count">account</reg>, <lb/>
I fear nothing. What is life to me that I should dread <lb/>
to lose it? If on any account I should tremble, it is on <lb/>
thine, my angelic girl. Thou dost not deserve thus early <lb/>
to perish; and yet if my love for thee were rational, <reg orig="per-|haps">perhaps</reg> <lb/>
I ought to wish it. An evil destiny will pursue thee to <lb/>
the close of thy life, be it never so long.</p>
<p>I know that ignorance and folly breed the phantoms by <lb/>
which themselves are perplexed and terrified, and that <reg orig="Whis-|ton">Whiston</reg> <lb/>
is a fool; but here the truth is too plain to be disguised. <lb/>
This malady is pestilential. Havoc and despair will <reg orig="ac-|company">accompany</reg> <lb/>
its progress, and its progress will be rapid. The <lb/>
tragedies of Marseilles and Messina will be reacted on this <lb/>
stage.</p>
<p>For a time, we in this quarter will be exempt, but it will <lb/>
surely reach us at last, and then, whither shall we fly? For <lb/>
the rich, the whole world is a safe asylum, but for us, <reg orig="indi-|gent">indigent</reg> <lb/>
and wretched, what fate is reserved but to stay and <lb/>
perish? If the disease spare us, we must perish by <reg orig="ne-|glect">neglect</reg> <lb/>
and famine. Alarm will be far and wide diffused. <lb/>
Fear will hinder those who supply the market, from entering <lb/>
<pb n="33" entity="eaf033v5_0046" pid="uva-lib:350312"/>
the city. The price of food will become exorbitant. Our <lb/>
present source of subsistence, ignominious and scanty as it <lb/>
is, will be cut off. Traffic and labor of every kind will be <lb/>
at an end. We shall die, but not until we have witnessed <lb/>
and endured horrors that surpass thy powers of conception.</p>
<p>I know full well the enormity of this evil. I have been <lb/>
at Messina, and talked with many who witnessed the state <lb/>
of that city in 1743. I will not freeze thy blood with the <lb/>
recital. Anticipation has a tendency to lessen or prevent <lb/>
some evils, but pestilence is not of that number. Strange <lb/>
untowardness of destiny! That thou and I should be cast <lb/>
upon a scene like this!</p>
<p>Mr. Dudley joined with uncommon powers of <reg orig="discern-|ment">discernment</reg>, <lb/>
a species of perverseness not easily accounted for. <lb/>
He acted as if the inevitable evils of her lot was not <reg orig="suffi-|cient">sufficient</reg> <lb/>
for the trial of his daughter's patience. Instead of <lb/>
comforter and counsellor, he fostered impatience in himself, <lb/>
and endeavored, with the utmost diligence, to undermine <lb/>
her fortitude and disconcert her schemes. The task was <lb/>
assigned to her, not only of subduing her own fears, but of <lb/>
maintaining the contest with his disastrous eloquence. In <lb/>
most cases she had not failed of success. Hitherto their <lb/>
causes of anxiety, her own observation had, in some degree, <lb/>
enabled her to estimate at their just value. The rueful <reg orig="pic-|tures">pictures</reg> <lb/>
which his imagination was wont to portray, affected <lb/>
her for a moment; but deliberate scrutiny commonly enabled <lb/>
her to detect and demonstrate their fallacy. Now, however, <lb/>
the theme was new. Panic and foreboding found their way <lb/>
to her heart in defiance of her struggles. She had no <reg orig="ex-|perience">experience</reg> <lb/>
by which to counteract this impulse. All that <reg orig="re-|mained">remained</reg> <lb/>
was to beguile her own and her father's cares by <lb/>
counterfeiting cheerfulness and introducing new topics.</p>
<p>This panic, stifled for a time, renewed its sway when she <lb/>
retired to her chamber. Never did futurity wear, to her <lb/>
fancy, so dark a hue. Never did her condition appear to <lb/>
her in a light so dreary and forlorn. To fly from the <reg orig="dan-|ger">danger</reg> <lb/>
was impossible. How should accommodation at a <reg orig="dis-|tance">distance</reg> <lb/>
be procured? The means of subsistence were <reg orig="in-|dissolubly">indissolubly</reg> <lb/>
connected with her present residence, but the <lb/>
progress of this disease would cut off these means, and <lb/>
<pb n="34" entity="eaf033v5_0047" pid="uva-lib:350313"/>
leave her to be beset not only with pestilence but famine. <lb/>
What provision could she make against an evil like this?</p>
<ornament type="line"/>
</div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="IV" id="d11">
<head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> terms on which she had been admitted into this house, <lb/>
included the advance of one quarter's rent and the monthly <lb/>
payment of subsequent dues. The requisite sum had been <lb/>
with difficulty collected, the landlord had twice called to <lb/>
remind her of her stipulation, and this day had been fixed <lb/>
for the discharge of this debt. He had omitted, contrary <lb/>
to her expectations and her wishes, to come. It was <reg orig="probi-|ble">probible</reg>, <lb/>
however, that they should meet on the ensuing day. I <lb/>
he should fail in this respect, it appeared to be her duty to <lb/>
carry the money to his house, and this it had been her <reg orig="resolu-|tion">resolution</reg> <lb/>
to perform.</p>
<p>Now, however, new views were suggested to her thoughts. <lb/>
By the payment of this debt she should leave herself nearly <lb/>
destitute. The flight and terror of the citizens would <reg orig="de-|prive">deprive</reg> <lb/>
her of employment. Want of food was an immediate <lb/>
and inevitable evil which the payment of this sum would <lb/>
produce. Was it just to incur this evil? To retain the <lb/>
means of luxurious gratification would be wrong, but to <reg orig="be-|reave">bereave</reg> <lb/>
herself and her father of bare subsistence was surely <lb/>
no dictate of duty.</p>
<p>It is true the penalty of nonpayment was always in the <lb/>
landlord's hands. He was empowered by the law to sell their <lb/>
moveables and expel them from his house. It was now to <lb/>
time for a penalty like this to be incurred. But from this <lb/>
treatment it was reasonable to hope that his lenity would <lb/>
save them. Was it not right to wait till the alternative of <lb/>
expulsion or payment was imposed? Meanwhile, however, <lb/>
she was subject to the torments of suspense and to the <lb/>
guilt of a broken promise. These consequences were to <lb/>
be eluded only in one way. By visiting her landlord and <lb/>
stating her true condition, it was possible that his compassion <lb/>
would remit claims which were, in themselves, unreasonable <lb/>
and uncommon. The tender of the money accompanied <lb/>
<pb n="35" entity="eaf033v5_0048" pid="uva-lib:350314"/>
by representations sufficiently earnest and pathetic, might <lb/>
possibly be declined.</p>
<p>These reflections were, next morning, submitted to her <lb/>
father. Her decision in this case was of less importance in <lb/>
his eyes, than in those of his daughter. Should the money <lb/>
be retained, it was, in his opinion, a pittance too small to <lb/>
afford them effectual support. Supposing provisions to be <lb/>
had at any price, which was, itself improbable, that price <lb/>
would be exorbitant. The general confusion would <reg orig="proba-|bly">probably</reg> <lb/>
last for months, and thirty dollars would be devoured in a <lb/>
few weeks even in a time of safety. To give or to keep <lb/>
was indifferent for another reason. It was absurd for those <lb/>
to consult about means of subsistence for the next month, <lb/>
when it was fixed that they should die tomorrow.&mdash;The <lb/>
true proceeding was obvious. The landlord's character was <lb/>
well known to him by means of the plaints and invectives of <lb/>
their neighbors, most of whom were tenants of the same <lb/>
man. If the money were offered, his avarice would receive <lb/>
it, in spite of all the pleas that she should urge. If it were <lb/>
detained without lieve, an officer of justice would quickly <lb/>
be despatched to claim it.</p>
<p>This statement was sufficient to take away from <reg orig="Con-|stantia">Constantia</reg> <lb/>
the hope that she had fostered. What then, said <lb/>
she, after a pause, is my father's advice? Shall I go <reg orig="forth-|with">forthwith</reg> <lb/>
and deliver the money?</p>
<p>No, said he, stay till he sends for it. Have you forgotten <lb/>
that Mathews resides in the very midst of this disease. <lb/>
There is no need to thrust yourself within its fangs. They <lb/>
will reach us time enough. It is likely his messenger will <lb/>
be an agent of the law. No matter. The debt will be <lb/>
merely increased by a few charges. In a state like ours, <lb/>
the miserable remnant is not worth caring for.</p>
<p>This reasoning, did not impart conviction to the lady. <lb/>
The danger, flowing from a tainted atmosphere was not <lb/>
small, but to incur that danger was wiser than to exasperate <lb/>
their landlord, to augment the debt and to encounter the <lb/>
disgrace, accruing from a constable's visits. The <reg orig="conversa-|tion">conversation</reg> <lb/>
was dropped, and, presently after, she set out on a visit <lb/>
to Mathews.</p>
<p>She fully estimated the importance to her happiness of <lb/>
the sum which she was going to pay. The general panic <lb/>
<pb n="36" entity="eaf033v5_0049" pid="uva-lib:350315"/>
had already, in some degree, produced the effect she chiefly <lb/>
dreaded; the failure of employment for her needle. Her <lb/>
father had, with his usual diligence at self-torment, supplied <lb/>
her with sufficient proofs of the covetous and obdurate <reg orig="tem-|per">temper</reg> <lb/>
of her creditor. Insupportable, however, as the evil of <lb/>
payment was, it was better to incur it spontaneously, than <lb/>
by means of legal process. The desperateness of this <reg orig="pro-|ceeding">proceeding</reg> <lb/>
therefore, did not prevent her from adopting it, but <lb/>
it filled her heart with the bitterest sensations. Absorbed <lb/>
as she past along, by these, she was nearly insensible to the <lb/>
vacancy which now prevailed in a quarter which formerly <lb/>
resounded with the din of voices and carriages.</p>
<p>As she approached the house to which she was going, her <lb/>
reluctance to proceed increased. Frequently she paused <lb/>
to recollect the motives that had prescribed this task, and to <lb/>
reinforce her purposes. At length she arrived at the house. <lb/>
Now, for the first time, her attention was excited by the <lb/>
silence and desolution that surrounded her. This evidence <lb/>
of fear and of danger struck upon her heart. All appeared <lb/>
to have fled from the presence of this unseen and terrible <lb/>
foe. The temerity of adventuring thus into the jaws of the <lb/>
pest, now appeared to her in glaring colors.</p>
<p>Appearances suggested a reflection which had not <reg orig="pre-|viously">previously</reg> <lb/>
occurred, and which tended to console her. Was it <lb/>
not probable that Mathews had likewise flown? His habits <lb/>
were calculated to endear to him his life; he would scarcely <lb/>
be among the last to shun perils like these; the omission <lb/>
of his promised visit on the preceding day, might be owing <lb/>
to his absence from the city, and thus, without subjection to <lb/>
any painful alternative, she might be suffered to retain the <lb/>
money.</p>
<p>To give certainty to this hope, she cast her eye towards <lb/>
the house opposite to which she now stood. Her heart <lb/>
drooped on perceiving proofs that the dwelling was still <reg orig="inhab-|ited">inhabited</reg>. <lb/>
The door was open and the windows in the second <lb/>
and third story were raised. Near the entrance, in the street, <lb/>
stood a cart. The horse attached to it, in his form and <lb/>
furniture and attitude, was an emblem of torper and decay. <lb/>
His gaunt sides, motionless limbs, his gummy and dead <lb/>
eyes, and his head hanging to the ground, were in unisco <lb/>
with the craziness of the vehicle to which he belonged, and <lb/>
<pb n="37" entity="eaf033v5_0050" pid="uva-lib:350316"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">4</fw></pb>
the paltry and bedusted harness which covered him. No <lb/>
attendant nor any human face was visible. The stillness, <lb/>
though at an hour customarily busy, was uninterrupted <reg orig="ex-|cept">except</reg> <lb/>
by the sound of wheels moving at an almost <reg orig="indistin-|guishable">indistinguishable</reg> <lb/>
distance.</p>
<p>She paused for a moment to contemplate this unwonted <lb/>
spectacle. Her trepidations were mingled with emotions <lb/>
not unakin to sublimity, but the consciousness of danger <lb/>
speedily prevailed, and she hastened to acquit herself of her <lb/>
engagement. She approached the door for this purpose, <lb/>
but before she could draw the bell her motions were <reg orig="arrest-|ed">arrested</reg> <lb/>
by sounds from within. The staircase was opposite the <lb/>
door. Two persons were now discovered descending the <lb/>
stair. They lifted between them a heavy mass, which was <lb/>
presently discerned to be a coffin. Shocked by this <reg orig="dis-|covery">discovery</reg> <lb/>
and trembling she withdrew from the entrance.</p>
<p>At this moment a door on the opposite side of the street <lb/>
opened and a female came out. Constantia approached <lb/>
her involuntarily and her appearance not being unattractive, <lb/>
adventured, more by gestures than by words, to inquire <lb/>
whose obsequies were thus unceremoniously conducted. <lb/>
The woman informed her that the dead was Mathews, who, <lb/>
two days before, was walking about, indifferent to, and <lb/>
braving danger. She cut short the narrative which her <lb/>
companion seemed willing to prolong, and to embellish with <lb/>
all its circumstances, and hastened home with her utmost <lb/>
expedition.</p>
<p>The mind of Constantia was a stranger to pusillanimity. <lb/>
Death, as the common lot of all, was regarded by her <reg orig="with-|out">without</reg> <lb/>
perturbation. The value of life, though not annihilated, <lb/>
was certainly diminished by adversity. With whatever <lb/>
solemnity contemplated, it excited on her own account, no <lb/>
aversion or inquietude. For her father's sake only, death <lb/>
was an evil to be ardently deprecated. The nature of the <lb/>
prevalent disease, the limits and modes of its influence, the <lb/>
risk that is incurred by approaching the sick or the dead, or <lb/>
by breathing the surrounding element, were subjects foreign <lb/>
to her education. She judged like the mass of mankind <lb/>
from the most obvious appearances, and was subject like <lb/>
them to impulses, which disdained the control of her reason. <lb/>
<pb n="38" entity="eaf033v5_0051" pid="uva-lib:350317"/>
With all her complacency for death and speculative <reg orig="resigna-|tion">resignation</reg> <lb/>
to the fate that governs the world, disquiet and alarm <lb/>
pervaded her bosom on this occasion.</p>
<p>The deplorable state to which her father would be <reg orig="reduc-|ed">reduced</reg> <lb/>
by her death, was seen and lamented, but her tremulous <lb/>
sensations flowed not from this source. They were, in <lb/>
some sort, inexplicable and mechanical. In spite of <reg orig="recol-|lection">recollection</reg> <lb/>
and reflection, they bewildered and harassed her, <lb/>
and subsided only of their own accord.</p>
<p>The death of Mathews was productive of one desirable <lb/>
consequence. Till the present tumult were passed, and his <lb/>
representatives had leisure to inspect his affairs, his <reg orig="debt-|ors">debtors</reg> <lb/>
would probably remain unmolested. He, likewise, who <lb/>
should succeed to the inheritance, might possess very <lb/>
different qualities, and be as much distinguished for equity <lb/>
as Mathews had been for extortion. These reflections <lb/>
lightened her footsteps as she hied homeward. The <reg orig="know-|ledge">knowledge</reg> <lb/>
she had gained, she hoped would counterpoise, in her <lb/>
father's apprehension, the perils, which accompanied the <lb/>
acquisition of it.</p>
<p>She had scarcely passed her own threshold, when she <lb/>
was followed by Whiston. This man pursued the <reg orig="occupa-|tion">occupation</reg> <lb/>
of a cooper. He performed journeywork in a shop, <lb/>
which, unfortunately for him, was situated near the water, <lb/>
and at a small distance from the scene of original infection. <lb/>
This day his employer had dismissed his workmen, and <lb/>
Whiston was at liberty to retire from the city; a scheme, <lb/>
which had been the theme of deliberation and discussion <lb/>
during the preceding fortnight.</p>
<p>Hitherto his apprehensions seemed to have molested <lb/>
others more than himself. The rumors and conjectures <reg orig="in-|dustriously">industriously</reg> <lb/>
collected during the day, were, in the evening, <lb/>
copiously detailed to his neighbors, and his own mind <lb/>
appeared to he disburthened of its cares, in proportion as <lb/>
he filled others with terror and inquietude. The predictions <lb/>
of physicians, the measures of precaution prescribed by the <lb/>
government, the progress of the malady, and the history of <lb/>
the victims who were hourly destroyed by it, were <reg orig="commu-|nicated">communicated</reg> <lb/>
with tormenting prolixity and terrifying minuteness.</p>
<p>On these accounts as well as on others, no one's visits <lb/>
were more unwelcome than his. As his deportment was <lb/>
<pb n="39" entity="eaf033v5_0052" pid="uva-lib:350318"/>
sober and honest, and his intentions harmless, he was always <lb/>
treated, by Constantia, with politeness, though his entrance <lb/>
always produced a momentary depression of her spirits. <lb/>
On this evening she was less fitted than ever to repel those <lb/>
anxieties which his conversation was qualified to produce. <lb/>
His entrance, therefore, was observed with sincere regret.</p>
<p>Contrary, however, to her expectation, Whiston brought <lb/>
with him new manners and a new expression of countenance. <lb/>
He was silent, abstracted, his eye was full of inquietude, <lb/>
and wandered with perpetual restlessness. On these tokens <lb/>
being remarked, he expressed, in faultering accents his <reg orig="be-|lief">belief</reg>, <lb/>
that he had contracted this disease, and that now it was <lb/>
too late for him to leave the city.</p>
<p>Mr. Dudley's education was somewhat medical. He <lb/>
was so far interested in his guest as to inquire into his <reg orig="sensa-|tions">sensations</reg>. <lb/>
They were such as were commonly the preludes to <lb/>
fever. Mr. Dudley, while he endeavored by cheerful tones, <lb/>
to banish his dejection, exhorted him to go home, and to <lb/>
take some hot and wholesome draught, in consequence of <lb/>
which, he might rise tomorrow with his usual health. This <lb/>
advice was gratefully received, and Whiston put a period to <lb/>
his visit much sooner than was customary.</p>
<p>Mr. Dudley entertained no doubts that Whiston was seized <lb/>
with the reigning disease, and extinguished the faint hope <lb/>
which his daughter had cherished, that their district would <lb/>
escape. Whiston's habitation was nearly opposite their <lb/>
own, but as they made no use of their front room, they had <lb/>
seldom an opportunity of observing the transactions of their <lb/>
neighbors. This distance and seclusion were congenial <lb/>
with her feelings, and she derived pleasure from her father's <lb/>
confession, that they contributed to personal security.</p>
<p>Constantia was accustomed to rise with the dawn, and <lb/>
traverse, for an hour, the State house Mall. As she took <lb/>
her walk the next morning, she pondered with astonishment <lb/>
on the present situation of the city. The air was bright <lb/>
and pure, and apparently salubrious. Security and silence <lb/>
seemed to hover over the scene. She was only reminded <lb/>
of the true state of things by the occasional appearance of <lb/>
carriages loaded with household utensils tending towards the <lb/>
country, and by the odour of vinegar by which every <reg orig="passen-|ger">passenger</reg> <lb/>
was accompanied. The public walk was cool and <reg orig="fra-|grant">fragrant</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="40" entity="eaf033v5_0053" pid="uva-lib:350319"/>
as formerly, skirted by verdure as bright, and shaded by <lb/>
foliage as luxuriant, but it was no longer frequented by <reg orig="live-|ly">lively</reg> <lb/>
steps and cheerful countenances. Its solitude was <reg orig="unin-|terrupted">uninterrupted</reg> <lb/>
by any but herself.</p>
<p>This day passed without furnishing any occasion to leave <lb/>
the house. She was less sedulously employed than usual, as <lb/>
the clothes, on which she was engaged, belonged to a family <lb/>
who had precipitately left the city. She had leisure <reg orig="there-|fore">therefore</reg> <lb/>
to ruminate. She could not but feel some concern in <lb/>
the fate of Whiston. He was a young man who subsisted <lb/>
on the fruits of his labor, and divided his gains with an only <lb/>
sister who lived with him, and who performed every <reg orig="house-|hold">household</reg> <lb/>
office.</p>
<p>This girl was humble and innocent, and of a temper <lb/>
affectionate and mild. Casual intercourse only had taken <lb/>
place between her and Constantia. They were too <reg orig="dissimi-|lar">dissimilar</reg> <lb/>
for any pleasure to arise from communication, but the <lb/>
latter was sufficiently disposed to extend to her harmless <lb/>
neighbor, the sympathy and succor which she needed. <lb/>
Whiston had come from a distant part of the country, and <lb/>
his sister was the only person in the city with whom he was <lb/>
connected by ties of kindred. In case of his sickness, <reg orig="there-|fore">therefore</reg>, <lb/>
their condition would be helpless and deplorable.</p>
<p>Evening arrived, and Whiston failed to pay his customary <lb/>
visit. She mentioned this omission to her father, and <reg orig="ex-|pressed">expressed</reg> <lb/>
her apprehension as to the cause of it. He did not <lb/>
discountenance the inference which she drew from this <reg orig="cir-|cumstance">circumstance</reg>, <lb/>
and assented to the justice of the picture which <lb/>
she drew of the calamitous state to which Whiston and his <lb/>
sister would be reduced by the indisposition of either. She <lb/>
then ventured to suggest the propriety of visiting the house, <lb/>
and of thus ascertaining the truth.</p>
<p>To this proposal Mr. Dudley urged the most vehement <lb/>
objections. What purpose could be served by entering their <lb/>
dwelling? What benefit would flow but the gratification of <lb/>
a dangerous curiosity? Constantia was disabled from <reg orig="fur-|nishing">furnishing</reg> <lb/>
pecuniary aid. She could not act the part of <reg orig="phy-|sician">physician</reg> <lb/>
or nurse. Her father stood in need of a thousand <lb/>
personal services, and the drudgery of cleansing and <reg orig="cook-|ing">cooking</reg>, <lb/>
already exceeded the bounds of her strength. The <lb/>
hazard of contracting the disease by conversing with the <lb/>
<pb n="41" entity="eaf033v5_0054" pid="uva-lib:350320"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">4*</fw></pb>
sick, was imminent. What services was she able to render <lb/>
equivalent to the consequences of her own sickness and <lb/>
death?</p>
<p>These representations had temporary influence. They <lb/>
recalled her for a moment, from her purpose, but this <reg orig="pur-|pose">purpose</reg> <lb/>
was speedily re-embraced. She reflected that the <lb/>
evil to herself, formidable as it was, was barely <reg orig="problemat-|ical">problematical</reg>. <lb/>
That converse with the sick would impart this disease, <lb/>
was by no means certain. Whiston might at least be visited. <lb/>
Perhaps she should find him well. If sick, his disease might <lb/>
be unepidemical, or curable by seasonable assistance. He <lb/>
might stand in need of a physician, and she was more able <lb/>
than his sister, to summon this aid.</p>
<p>Her father listened calmly to her reasonings. After a <lb/>
pause, he gave his consent. In doing this he was <reg orig="influenc-|ed">influenced</reg> <lb/>
not by the conviction that his daughter's safety would be <lb/>
exposed to no hazard, but from a belief that though she <lb/>
might shun infection for the present, it would inevitably seize <lb/>
her during some period of the progress of this pest.</p>
<ornament type="line"/>
</div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="V" id="d12">
<head>CHAPTER V.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">It</hi> was now dusk and she hastened to perform this duty. <lb/>
Whiston's dwelling was wooden and of small dimensions. <lb/>
She lifted the latch softly and entered. The lower room <lb/>
was unoccupied. She advanced to the foot of a narrow <lb/>
staircase, and knocked and listened, but no answer was <reg orig="re-|turned">returned</reg> <lb/>
to the summons. Hence there was reason to infer <lb/>
that no one was within, but this, from other considerations, <lb/>
was extremely improbable. The truth could be ascertained <lb/>
only by ascending the stair. Some feminine scruples were <lb/>
to be subdued before this proceeding could be adopted.</p>
<p>After some hesitation, she determined to ascend. The <lb/>
staircase was terminated by a door at which she again <reg orig="knock-|ed">knocked</reg> <lb/>
for admission, but in vain. She listened, and presently <lb/>
heard the motion as of some one in bed. This was <reg orig="succeed-|ed">succeeded</reg> <lb/>
by tokens of vehement exertions to vomit. These signs <lb/>
<pb n="42" entity="eaf033v5_0055" pid="uva-lib:350321"/>
convincing her that the house was not without a tenant, she <lb/>
could not hesitate to enter the room.</p>
<p>Lying in a tattered bed, she now discovered Mary <reg orig="Whis-|ton">Whiston</reg>. <lb/>
Her face was flushed and swelled, her eyes closed, <lb/>
and some power appeared to have laid a leaden hand upon <lb/>
her faculties. The floor was moistened and stained by the <lb/>
effusion from her stomach. Constantia touched her hand, <lb/>
and endeavored to rouse her. It was with difficulty that <lb/>
her attention was excited. Her languid eyes were scarcely <lb/>
opened before they again closed and she sunk into <reg orig="forgetful-|ness">forgetfulness</reg>.</p>
<p>Repeated efforts, however, at length recalled her to herself, <lb/>
and extorted from her some account of her condition. On <lb/>
the day before, at noon, her stomach became diseased, her <lb/>
head dizzy, and her limbs unable to support her. Her <lb/>
brother was absent, and her drowsiness, interrupted only by <lb/>
paroxysms of vomiting, continued till his return late in the <lb/>
evening. He had then shewn himself, for a few minutes, <lb/>
at her bedside, had made some inquiries and precipitately <lb/>
retired, since when he had not reappeared.</p>
<p>It was natural to imagine that Whiston had gone to <reg orig="pro-|cure">procure</reg> <lb/>
medical assistance. That he had not returned, during <lb/>
a day and a half, was matter of surprise. His own <reg orig="indisposi-|tion">indisposition</reg> <lb/>
was recollected, and his absence could only be <reg orig="account-|ed">accounted</reg> <lb/>
for by supposing that sickness had disabled him from <lb/>
regaining his own house. What was his real destiny, it was <lb/>
impossible to conjecture. It was not till some months after <lb/>
this period that satisfactory intelligence was gained upon this <lb/>
head.</p>
<p>It appeared that Whiston had allowed his terrors to <reg orig="over-|power">overpower</reg> <lb/>
the sense of what was due to his sister and to <reg orig="hu-|manity">humanity</reg>. <lb/>
On discovering the condition of the unhappy girl, <lb/>
he left the house, and, instead of seeking a physician, he <lb/>
turned his steps towards the country. After travelling some <lb/>
hours, being exhausted by want of food, by fatigue, and by <lb/>
mental as well as bodily anguish, he laid himself down under <lb/>
the shelter of a hayrick, in a vacant field. Here he was <lb/>
discovered in the morning by the inhabitants of a <reg orig="neighbor-|ing">neighboring</reg> <lb/>
farm house. These people had too much regard for <lb/>
their own safety to accommodate him under their roof, or <lb/>
even to approach within fifty paces of his person.</p>
<pb n="43" entity="eaf033v5_0056" pid="uva-lib:350322"/>
<p>A passenger, whose attention and compassion had been <lb/>
excited by this incident, was endowed with more courage. <lb/>
He lifted the stranger in his arms, and carried him from this <lb/>
unwholesome spot to a barn. This was the only service <lb/>
which the passenger was able to perform. Whiston, <reg orig="desert-|ed">deserted</reg> <lb/>
by every human creature, burning with fever, tormented <lb/>
into madness by thirst, spent three miserable days in agony. <lb/>
When dead, no one would cover his body with earth, but he <lb/>
was suffered to decay by piecemeal.</p>
<p>The dwelling, being at no great distance from the barn, <lb/>
could not be wholly screened from the malignant vapor <lb/>
which a corpse, thus neglected, could not fail to produce. <lb/>
The inhabitants were preparing on this account, to change <lb/>
their abode, but, on the eve of their departure, the master of <lb/>
the family became sick. He was, in a short time, followed <lb/>
to the grave by his mother, his wife and four children.</p>
<p>They probably imbibed their disease from the tainted <reg orig="at-|mosphere">atmosphere</reg> <lb/>
around them. The life of Whiston and their own <lb/>
lives, might have been saved by affording the wanderer an <lb/>
asylum and suitable treatment, or at least, their own deaths <lb/>
might have been avoided by interring his remains.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Constantia was occupied with reflecting on the <lb/>
scene before her. Not only a physician but a nurse was <lb/>
wanting. The last province it was more easy for her to <reg orig="sup-|ply">supply</reg> <lb/>
than the former. She was acquainted with the abode of <lb/>
but one physician. He lived at no small distance from this <lb/>
spot. To him she immediately hastened, but he was absent, <lb/>
and his numerous engagements left it wholly uncertain when <lb/>
he would return and whether he would consent to increase <lb/>
the number of his patients. Direction was obtained to the <lb/>
residence of another, who was happily disengaged, and who <lb/>
promised to attend immediately. Satisfied with this <reg orig="assur-|ance">assurance</reg>, <lb/>
she neglected to request directions, by which she <lb/>
might regulate herself on his failing to come.</p>
<p>During her return her thoughts were painfully employed <lb/>
in considering the mode proper for her to pursue, in her <reg orig="pre-|sent">present</reg> <lb/>
perplexing situation. She was for the most part <reg orig="unac-|quainted">unacquainted</reg> <lb/>
with the character of those who composed her <reg orig="neigh-|borhood">neighborhood</reg>. <lb/>
That any would be willing to undertake the <reg orig="ten-|dance">tendance</reg> <lb/>
of this girl was by no means probable. As wives and <lb/>
mothers, it would perhaps be unjust to require or permit it. <lb/>
<pb n="44" entity="eaf033v5_0057" pid="uva-lib:350323"/>
As to herself there were labors and duties of her own <reg orig="suffi-|cient">sufficient</reg> <lb/>
to engross her faculties, yet, by whatever foreign cares <lb/>
or tasks she was oppressed, she felt that, to desert this being, <lb/>
was impossible.</p>
<p>In the absence of her friend, Mary's state exhibited no <lb/>
change. Constantia, on regaining the house, lighted the <lb/>
remnant of a candle, and resumed her place by the bedside <lb/>
of the sick girl. She impatiently waited for the arrival of the <lb/>
physician, but hour succeeded hour and he came not. All <lb/>
hope of his coming being extinguished, she bethought <reg orig="her-|self">herself</reg> <lb/>
that her father might be able to inform her of the best <lb/>
manner of proceeding. It was likewise her duty to relieve <lb/>
him from the suspense in which her absence would <reg orig="unavoida-|bly">unavoidably</reg> <lb/>
plunge him.</p>
<p>On entering her own apartment she found a stranger in <lb/>
company with Mr. Dudley. The latter perceiving that she <lb/>
had returned, speedily acquainted her with the views of their <lb/>
guest. His name was M'Crea; he was the nephew of their <lb/>
landlord and was now become, by reversion, the proprietor <lb/>
of the house which they occupied. Mathews had been <reg orig="bu-|ried">buried</reg> <lb/>
the preceding day, and M'Crea, being well acquainted <lb/>
with the engagements which subsisted between the deceased <lb/>
and Mr. Dudley, had come, thus unseasonably, to demand <lb/>
the rent. He was not unconscious of the inhumanity and <lb/>
sordidness of this proceeding, and therefore, endeavored to <lb/>
disguise it by the usual pretences. All his funds were <reg orig="ex-|hausted">exhausted</reg>. <lb/>
He came not only in his own name, but in that of <lb/>
Mrs. Mathews his aunt, who was destitute of money to <reg orig="pro-|cure">procure</reg> <lb/>
daily and indispensable provision, and who was striving <lb/>
to collect a sufficient sum to enable her and the remains of <lb/>
her family, to fly from a spot where their lives were in <reg orig="per-|petual">perpetual</reg> <lb/>
danger.</p>
<p>These excuses were abundantly fallacious, but Mr. <reg orig="Dud-|ley">Dudley</reg> <lb/>
was too proud to solicit the forbearance of a man like <lb/>
this. He recollected that the engagement on his part was <lb/>
voluntary and explicit, and he disdained to urge his present <lb/>
exigencies as reasons for retracting it. He expressed the <lb/>
utmost readiness to comply with the demand, and merely <lb/>
desired him to wait till Miss Dudley returned. From the <lb/>
inquietudes with which the unusual duration of her absence <lb/>
had filled him, he was now relieved by her entrance.</p>
<pb n="45" entity="eaf033v5_0058" pid="uva-lib:350324"/>
<p>With an indignant and desponding heart, she complied <lb/>
with her father's directions, and the money being reluctantly <lb/>
delivered, M'Crea took a hasty leave. She was too <reg orig="deep-|ly">deeply</reg> <lb/>
interested in the fate of Mary Whiston, to allow her <lb/>
thoughts to be diverted for the present into a new channel. <lb/>
She described the desolate condition of the girl to her <reg orig="fath-|er">father</reg>, <lb/>
and besought him to think of something suitable to her <lb/>
relief.</p>
<p>Mr. Dudley's humanity would not suffer him to <reg orig="disap-|prove">disapprove</reg> <lb/>
of his daughter's proceeding. He imagined that the <lb/>
symptoms of the patient portended a fatal issue. There <lb/>
were certain complicated remedies which might possibly be <lb/>
beneficial, but these were too costly, and the application <lb/>
would demand more strength than his daughter could <reg orig="be-|stow">bestow</reg>. <lb/>
He was unwilling, however, to leave any thing <reg orig="with-|in">within</reg> <lb/>
his power, untried. Pharmacy had been his trade, and <lb/>
he had reserved, for domestic use, some of the most <reg orig="power-|ful">powerful</reg> <lb/>
evacuants. Constantia was supplied with some of these, <lb/>
and he consented that she should spend the night with her <lb/>
patient, and watch their operation.</p>
<p>The unhappy Mary received whatever was offered, but <lb/>
her stomach refused to retain it. The night was passed by <lb/>
Constantia without closing her eyes. As soon as the day <lb/>
dawned, she prepared once more to summon the physician, <lb/>
who had failed to comply with his promise. She had <reg orig="scarce-|ly">scarcely</reg> <lb/>
left the house, however, before she met him. He <reg orig="plead-|ed">pleaded</reg> <lb/>
his numerous engagements in excuse for his last night's <lb/>
negligence, and desired her to make haste to conduct him to <lb/>
the patient.</p>
<p>Having scrutinized her symptoms, he expressed his <reg orig="hope-|lessness">hopelessness</reg> <lb/>
of her recovery. Being informed of the mode in <lb/>
which she had been treated, he declared his approbation of <lb/>
it, but intimated, that these being unsuccessful, all that <reg orig="re-|mained">remained</reg> <lb/>
was to furnish her with any liquid she might choose <lb/>
to demand, and wait patiently for the event. During this <lb/>
interview, the physician surveyed the person and dress of <lb/>
Constantia with an inquisitive eye. His countenance <reg orig="be-|trayed">betrayed</reg> <lb/>
marks of curiosity and compassion, and had he made <lb/>
any approaches to confidence and friendliness, Constantia <lb/>
would not have repelled them. His air was benevolent and <lb/>
candid, and she estimated highly the usefulness of a <reg orig="counsel-|andlor">counselandlor</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="46" entity="eaf033v5_0059" pid="uva-lib:350325"/>
friend in her present circumstances. Some motive, <lb/>
however, hindered him from tendering his service, and, in <lb/>
a few moments, he withdrew.</p>
<p>Mary's condition hourly grew worse. A corroded and <lb/>
gangrenous stomach was quickly testified by the dark hue <lb/>
and poisonous malignity of the matter which was frequently <lb/>
ejected from it. Her stupor gave place to some degree of <lb/>
peevishness and restlessness. She drank the water that was <lb/>
held to her lips with unspeakable avidity, and derived from <lb/>
this source a momentary alleviation of her pangs. <reg orig="Fortu-|nately">Fortunately</reg> <lb/>
for her attendant, her agonies were not of long duration. <lb/>
Constantia was absent from her bedside as rarely, and for <lb/>
periods as short as possible. On the succeeding night, the <lb/>
sufferings of the patient terminated in death.</p>
<p>This event took place at two o'clock in the morning. <lb/>
An hour whose customary stillness was, if possible, <reg orig="increas-|ed">increased</reg> <lb/>
tenfold by the desolation of the city. The poverty of <lb/>
Mary and of her nurse had deprived the former of the <reg orig="ben-|efits">benefits</reg> <lb/>
resulting from the change of bed and clothes. Every <lb/>
thing about her was in a condition noisome and detestable. <lb/>
Her yellowish and haggard visage, conspicuous by a feeble <lb/>
light, an atmosphere freighted with malignant vapors, and <lb/>
reminding Constantia at every instant, of the perils which <lb/>
encompassed her, the consciousness of solitude and <reg orig="sensa-|tions">sensations</reg> <lb/>
of deadly sickness in her own frame, were sufficient to <lb/>
intimidate a soul of firmer texture than hers.</p>
<p>She was sinking fast into helplessness, when a new train <lb/>
of reflections showed her the necessity of perseverance. All <lb/>
that remained was to consign the corpse to the grave. She <lb/>
knew that vehicles for this end were provided at the public <lb/>
expense, that notice being given of the occasion there was for <lb/>
their attendance, a receptacle and carriage for the dead <lb/>
would be instantly provided. Application, at this hour, she <lb/>
imagined would be unseasonable. It must be deferred till <lb/>
the morning which was yet at some distance.</p>
<p>Meanwhile to remain at her present post, was equally <lb/>
useless and dangerous. She endeavored to stifle the <reg orig="con-|viction">conviction</reg>, <lb/>
that some mortal sickness had seized upon her own <lb/>
frame. Her anxieties of head and stomach she was willing <lb/>
to impute to extraordinary fatigue and watchfulness; and <lb/>
hoped that they would be dissipated by an hour's <reg orig="unmolest-|ed">unmolested</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="47" entity="eaf033v5_0060" pid="uva-lib:350326"/>
repose. She formed the resolution of seeking her own <lb/>
chamber.</p>
<p>At this moment, however, the universal silence underwent <lb/>
a slight interruption. The sound was familiar to her ears. <lb/>
It was a signal frequently repeated at the midnight hour <reg orig="dur-|ing">during</reg> <lb/>
this season of calamity. It was the slow movement of <lb/>
a hearse, apparently passing along the street, in which the <lb/>
alley, where Mr. Dudley resided, terminated. At first, this <lb/>
sound had no other effect than to aggravate the dreariness of <lb/>
all around her. Presently it occurred to her that this <reg orig="vehi-|cle">vehicle</reg> <lb/>
might be disengaged. She conceived herself bound to <lb/>
see the last offices performed for the deceased Mary. The <lb/>
sooner so irksome a duty was discharged the better. Every <lb/>
hour might augment her incapacity for exertion. Should <lb/>
she be unable when the morning arrived, to go as far as the <lb/>
city hall, and give the necessary information, the most <reg orig="shock-|ing">shocking</reg> <lb/>
consequences would ensue. Whiston's house and her <lb/>
own were opposite each other, and not connected with any <lb/>
on the same side. A narrow space divided them, and her <lb/>
own chamber was within the sphere of the contagion which <lb/>
would flow, in consequence of such neglect, from that of her <lb/>
neighbor.</p>
<p>Influenced by these considerations she passed into the <lb/>
street, and gained the corner of the alley, just as the <reg orig="car-|riage">carriage</reg>, <lb/>
whose movements she had heard, arrived at the same <lb/>
spot. It was accompanied by two men, negroes, who <reg orig="listen-|ed">listened</reg> <lb/>
to her tale with respect. Having already a burthen of <lb/>
this kind, they could not immediately comply with this <reg orig="re-|quest">request</reg>. <lb/>
They promised that, having disposed of their <reg orig="pre-|sent">present</reg> <lb/>
charge, they would return forthwith and be ready to <lb/>
execute her orders.</p>
<p>Happily one of these persons was known to her. At other <lb/>
seasons his occupation was that of <hi rend="italic">woodcarter,</hi> and as such <lb/>
he had performed some services for Mr. Dudley. His <reg orig="tem-|per">temper</reg> <lb/>
was gentle and obliging. The character of Constantia <lb/>
had been viewed by him with reverence, and his kindness <lb/>
had relieved her from many painful offices. His old <reg orig="occu-|pation">occupation</reg> <lb/>
being laid aside for a time, he had betaken himself, <lb/>
like many others of his color and rank, to the conveyance <lb/>
and burial of the dead.</p>
<p>At Constantia's request, he accompanied her to Whiston's <lb/>
<pb n="48" entity="eaf033v5_0061" pid="uva-lib:350327"/>
house, and promised to bring with him such assistance, as <lb/>
would render her farther exertions and attendance <reg orig="unneces-|sary">unnecessary</reg>. <lb/>
Glad to be absolved from any new task, she now <reg orig="re-|tired">retired</reg> <lb/>
to her own chamber. In spite of her distempered <lb/>
frame, she presently sunk into sweet sleep. She awoke not <lb/>
till the day had made considerable progress, and found <reg orig="her-|self">herself</reg> <lb/>
invigorated and refreshed. On re-entering Whiston's <lb/>
house, she discovered that her humble friend had faithfully <lb/>
performed his promise, the dead body having disappeared. <lb/>
She deemed it unsafe, as well as unnecessary, to examine <lb/>
the clothes and other property remaining, but leaving every <lb/>
thing in the condition in which it had been found, she <reg orig="fasten-|ed">fastened</reg> <lb/>
the windows and doors, and thenceforth kept as distant <lb/>
from the house as possible.</p>

<head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Constantia</hi> had now leisure to ruminate upon her own <lb/>
condition. Every day added to the devastation and <reg orig="confu-|sion">confusion</reg> <lb/>
of the city. The most populous streets were deserted <lb/>
and silent. The greater number of inhabitants had fled, and <lb/>
those who remained were occupied with no cares but those <lb/>
which related to their own safety. The labors of the artisan <lb/>
and the speculations of the merchant were suspended. All <lb/>
shops, but those of the apothecaries were shut. No carriage <lb/>
but the hearse was seen, and this was employed, night and <lb/>
day, in the removal of the dead. The customary sources of <lb/>
subsistence were cut off. Those, whose fortunes enabled <lb/>
them to leave the city, but who had deferred till now their <lb/>
retreat, were denied an asylum by the terror which pervaded <lb/>
the adjacent country, and by the cruel prohibitions which the <lb/>
neighboring towns and cities thought it necessary to adopt. <lb/>
Those who lived by the fruits of their daily labor were <reg orig="sub-|jected">subjected</reg>, <lb/>
in this total inactivity, to the alternative of starving, or <lb/>
of subsisting upon public charity.</p>
<p>The meditations of Constantia, suggested no alternative <lb/>
but this. The exactions of M'Crea had reduced her whole <lb/>
fortune to five dollars. This would rapidly decay, and her <lb/>
utmost ingenuity could discover no means of procuring a <lb/>
<pb n="49" entity="eaf033v5_0062" pid="uva-lib:350328"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">5</fw></pb>
new supply. All the habits of their life had combined to <lb/>
fill both her father and herself with aversion to the <reg orig="accept-|ance">acceptance</reg> <lb/>
of charity. Yet this avenue, opprobrious and <reg orig="disgust-|ful">disgustful</reg> <lb/>
as it was, afforded the only means of escaping from the <lb/>
worst extremes of famine.</p>
<p>In this state of mind it was obvious to consider in what <lb/>
way the sum remaining might be most usefully expended. <lb/>
Every species of provision was not equally nutritious or <lb/>
equally cheap. Her mind, active in the pursuit of <reg orig="know-|ledge">knowledge</reg> <lb/>
and fertile of resources, had lately been engaged, in <lb/>
discussing with her father, the best means of retaining health, <lb/>
in a time of pestilence. On occasions, when the malignity <lb/>
of contagious diseases has been most signal, some individuals <lb/>
have escaped. For their safety, they were doubtless <reg orig="indebt-|ed">indebted</reg> <lb/>
to some peculiarities in their constitution or habits. <lb/>
Their diet, their dress, their kind and degree of exercise, <lb/>
must somewhat have contributed to their exemption from <lb/>
the common destiny. These, perhaps, could be ascertained, <lb/>
and when known it was surely proper to conform to them.</p>
<p>In discussing these ideas, Mr. Dudley introduced the <lb/>
mention of a Benedictine of Messina, who, during the <lb/>
prevalence of the plague in that city, was incessantly <reg orig="engag-|ed">engaged</reg> <lb/>
in administering assistance to those who needed. <reg orig="Not-|withstanding">Notwithstanding</reg> <lb/>
his perpetual hazards, he retained perfect health, <lb/>
and was living thirty years after this event. During this <lb/>
period, he fostered a tranquil, fearless, and benevolent spirit, <lb/>
and restricted his diet to water and pollenta. Spices, and <lb/>
meats, and liquors, and all complexities of cookery were <lb/>
utterly discarded.</p>
<p>These facts now occurred to Constantia's reflections with <lb/>
new vividness, and led to interesting consequences. Pollenta <lb/>
and hasty-pudding or samp, are preparations of the same <lb/>
substance; a substance which she needed not the experience <lb/>
of others to convince her was no less grateful than nutritive. <lb/>
Indian meal was procurable at ninety cents per bushel. By <lb/>
recollecting former experiments, she knew that this quantity, <lb/>
with no accompaniment but salt, would supply wholesome <lb/>
and plentiful food for four months to one person.<ref target="n2" n="1">*</ref>
<note id="n2" place="foot" n="1"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>See this useful fact explained and demonstrated in Count Rumford's <lb/>
Essays.</p></note>
 The <reg orig="in-|ference">inference</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="50" entity="eaf033v5_0063" pid="uva-lib:350329"/>
was palpable. Three persons were now to be <reg orig="suppli-|ed">supplied</reg> <lb/>
with food, and this supply could be furnished, during four <lb/>
months, at the trivial expense of three dollars. This <reg orig="ex-|pedient">expedient</reg> <lb/>
was at once so uncommon and so desirable, as to be <lb/>
regarded with temporary disbelief. She was inclined to <lb/>
suspect some latent error in her calculation. That a sum <lb/>
thus applied, should suffice for the subsistence of a year, <lb/>
which, in ordinary cases, is expended in a few days, was <lb/>
scarcely credible. The more closely, however, the subject <lb/>
was examined, the more incontestably did this inference <lb/>
flow. The mode of preparation was simple and easy, and <lb/>
productive of the fewest toils and inconveniences. The <reg orig="at-|tention">attention</reg> <lb/>
of her Lucy was sufficient to this end, and the <lb/>
drudgery of marketing was wholly precluded.</p>
<p>She easily obtained the concurrence of her father and the <lb/>
scheme was found as practicable and beneficial as her fondes <lb/>
expectations had predicted. Infallible security was thus <lb/>
provided against hunger. This was the only care that was <lb/>
urgent and immediate. While they had food and were <reg orig="ex-|empt">exempt</reg> <lb/>
from disease, they could live, and were not without <lb/>
their portion of comfort. Her hands were unemployed <lb/>
but her mind was kept in continual activity. To seclude <lb/>
herself as much as possible from others, was the best means <lb/>
of avoiding infection. Spectacles of misery which she was <lb/>
unable to relieve, would merely tend to harass her with <lb/>
useless disquietudes and make her frame more accessible in <lb/>
disease. Her father's instructions were sufficient to give <lb/>
her a competent acquaintance with the Italian and French <lb/>
languages. His dreary hours were beguiled by this <reg orig="employ-|ment">employment</reg>, <lb/>
and her mind was furnished with a species of <reg orig="know-|ledge">knowledge</reg>, <lb/>
which she hoped, in future, to make subservient to a <lb/>
more respectable and plentiful subsistence than she had <lb/>
hitherto enjoyed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the season advanced, and the havoc which <lb/>
this fatal malady produced, increased with portentous <reg orig="ra-|pidity">rapidity</reg>. <lb/>
In alleys and narrow streets, in which the house <lb/>
were smaller, the inhabitants more numerous and indigent <lb/>
and the air pent up within unwholesome limits, it raged with <lb/>
greatest violence. Few of Constantia's neighbors possessed <lb/>
the means of removing from the danger. The inhabitants <lb/>
of this alley consisted of three hundred persons. Of these <lb/>
<pb n="51" entity="eaf033v5_0064" pid="uva-lib:350330"/>
eight or ten experienced no interruption of their health. <lb/>
Of the rest two hundred were destroyed in the course of <lb/>
three weeks. Among so many victims, it may be supposed <lb/>
that this disease assumed every terrific and agonizing shape.</p>
<p>It was impossible for Constantia to shut out every token <lb/>
of a calamity thus enormous and thus near. Night was the <lb/>
season usually selected for the removal of the dead. The <lb/>
sound of wheels thus employed was incessant. This, and <lb/>
the images with which it was sure to be accompanied, <lb/>
bereaved her of repose. The shrieks and laments of <lb/>
survivors, who could not be prevented from attending the <lb/>
remains of a husband or child to the place of interment, <lb/>
frequently struck her senses. Sometimes urged by a furious <lb/>
delirium, the sick would break from their attendants, rush <lb/>
into the streets, and expire on the pavement, amidst frantic <lb/>
outcries and gestures. By these she was often roused from <lb/>
imperfect sleep, and called to reflect upon the fate which <lb/>
impended over her father and herself.</p>
<p>To preserve health in an atmosphere thus infected, and to <lb/>
ward off terror and dismay in a scene of horrors thus hourly <lb/>
accumulating, was impossible. Constantia found it vain to <lb/>
contend against the inroads of sadness. Amidst so <reg orig="dread-|ful">dreadful</reg> <lb/>
a mortality, it was irrational to cherish the hope that she <lb/>
or her father would escape. Her sensations, in no long <lb/>
time, seemed to justify her apprehensions. Her appetite <lb/>
forsook her, her strength failed, the thirst and lassitude of <lb/>
fever invaded her, and the grave seemed to open for her <lb/>
reception.</p>
<p>Lucy was assailed by the same symptoms at the same <lb/>
time. Household offices were unavoidably neglected. Mr. <lb/>
Dudley retained his health, but he was able only to prepare <lb/>
his scanty food, and supply the cravings of his child, with <lb/>
water from the well. His imagination marked him out for <lb/>
the next victim. He could not be blind to the consequences <lb/>
of his own indisposition, at a period so critical. Disabled <lb/>
from contributing to each other's assistance, destitute of <lb/>
medicine and food, and even of water to quench their <reg orig="tor-|menting">tormenting</reg> <lb/>
thirst, unvisited, unknown, and perishing in frightful <lb/>
solitude!&mdash;These images had a tendency to prostrate the <lb/>
mind, and generate or ripen the seeds of this fatal malady, <lb/>
<pb n="52" entity="eaf033v5_0065" pid="uva-lib:350331"/>
which, no doubt, at this period of its progress, every one <lb/>
had imbibed.</p>
<p>Contrary to all his fears, he awoke each morning free <lb/>
from pain, though not without an increase of debility. <reg orig="Ab-|stinence">Abstinence</reg> <lb/>
from food, and the liberal use of cold water seemed <lb/>
to have a medicinal operation on the sick. Their pulse <lb/>
gradually resumed its healthful tenor, their strength and their <lb/>
appetite slowly returned, and in ten days they were able to <lb/>
congratulate each other on their restoration.</p>
<p>I will not recount that series of disastrous thoughts which <lb/>
occupied the mind of Constantia during this period. Her <lb/>
lingering and sleepless hours were regarded by her as <reg orig="pre-|ludes">preludes</reg> <lb/>
to death. Though at so immature an age, she had <lb/>
gained large experience of the evils which are allotted to <lb/>
man. Death, which, in her prosperous state, was peculiarly <lb/>
abhorrent to her feelings, was now disrobed of terror. As <lb/>
an entrance into scenes of lightsome and imperishable being, <lb/>
it was the goal of all her wishes. As a passage to oblivion <lb/>
it was still desirable, since forgetfulness was better than the <lb/>
life which she had hitherto led, and which, should her <reg orig="ex-|istence">existence</reg> <lb/>
be prolonged, it was likely that she could continue to <lb/>
lead.</p>
<p>These gloomy meditations were derived from the langour <lb/>
of her frame. When these disappeared, her cheerfulness <lb/>
and fortitude revived. She regarded with astonishment and <lb/>
delight, the continuance of her father's health and her own <lb/>
restoration. That trial seemed to have been safely <reg orig="under-|gone">undergone</reg>, <lb/>
to which the life of every one was subject. The air <lb/>
which till now had been arid and sultry, was changed into <lb/>
cool and moist. The pestilence had reached its utmost <lb/>
height, and now symptoms of remission and decline begin <lb/>
to appear. Its declension was more rapid than its progress, <lb/>
and every day added vigor to hope.</p>
<p>When her strength was somewhat retrieved, Constantia <lb/>
called to mind a good woman who lived in her former <lb/>
neighborhood, and from whom she had received many proofs <lb/>
of artless affection. This woman's name was Sarah Baxter. <lb/>
She lived within a small distance of Constantia's former <lb/>
dwelling. The trade of her husband was that of porter, <lb/>
and she pursued, in addition to the care of a numerous <lb/>
family, the business of a laundress. The superior <reg orig="know-|ledge">knowledge</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="53" entity="eaf033v5_0066" pid="uva-lib:350332"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">5*</fw></pb>
and address of Constantia, had enabled her to be <lb/>
serviceable to this woman in certain painful and perplexing <lb/>
circumstances.</p>
<p>This service was repaid with the utmost gratitude. Sarah <lb/>
regarded her benefactress with a species of devotion. She <lb/>
could not endure to behold one, whom every accent and <lb/>
gesture proved to have once enjoyed affluence and dignity, <lb/>
performing any servile office. In spite of her own multiplied <lb/>
engagements, she compelled Constantia to accept her <reg orig="assist-|ance">assistance</reg> <lb/>
on many occasions, and could scarcely be prevailed <lb/>
upon to receive any compensation for her labor. Washing <lb/>
clothes was her trade, and from this task she insisted on <lb/>
relieving her lovely patroness.</p>
<p>Constantia's change of dwelling produced much regret in <lb/>
the kind Sarah. She did not allow it to make any change <lb/>
in their previous arrangements, but punctually visited the <lb/>
Dudleys once a week, and carried home with her whatever <lb/>
stood in need of ablution. When the prevalence of disease <lb/>
disabled Constantia from paying her the usual wages, she <lb/>
would, by no means, consent to be absolved from this task. <lb/>
Her earnestness on this head was not to be eluded, and <lb/>
Constantia, in consenting that her work should, for the <lb/>
present, be performed gratuitously, solaced herself with the <lb/>
prospect of being able, by some future change of fortune, <lb/>
amply to reward her.</p>
<p>Sarah's abode was distant from danger, and her fears were <lb/>
turbulent. She was, nevertheless, punctual in her visits to <lb/>
the Dudleys, and anxious for their safety. In case of their <lb/>
sickness, she had declared her resolution to be their <reg orig="attend-|ant">attendant</reg> <lb/>
and nurse. Suddenly, however, her visits ceased. <lb/>
The day on which her usual visit was paid, was the same <lb/>
with that on which Constantia sickened, but her coming was <lb/>
expected in vain. Her absence was, on some accounts, <reg orig="re-|garded">regarded</reg> <lb/>
with pleasure, as it probably secured her from the <lb/>
danger connected with the office of a nurse, but it added to <lb/>
Constantia's cares, inasmuch as her own sickness, or that of <lb/>
some of her family, was the only cause of her detention.</p>
<p>To remove her doubts, the first use which Constantia <lb/>
made of her recovered strength, was to visit her laundress. <lb/>
Sarah's house was a theatre of suffering. Her husband was <lb/>
<pb n="54" entity="eaf033v5_0067" pid="uva-lib:350333"/>
the first of his family assailed by the reigning disease. Two <lb/>
daughters, nearly grown to womanhood, well disposed and <lb/>
modest girls, the pride and support of their mother, and who <lb/>
lived at service, returned home, sick, at the same time, and <lb/>
died in a few days. Her husband had struggled for eleven <lb/>
days with his disease, and was seized, just before <reg orig="Constan-|tia's">Constantia's</reg> <lb/>
arrival, with the pangs of death.</p>
<p>Baxter was endowed with great robustness and activity. <lb/>
This disease did not vanquish him but with tedious and <lb/>
painful struggles. His muscular force now exhausted itself <lb/>
in ghastly contortions, and the house resounded with his <lb/>
ravings. Sarah's courage had yielded to so rapid a <reg orig="succes-|sion">succession</reg> <lb/>
of evils. Constantia found her shut up in a chamber, <lb/>
distant from that of her dying husband, in a paroxysm of <lb/>
grief, and surrounded by her younger children.</p>
<p>Constantia's entrance was like that of an angelic comforter. <lb/>
Sarah was unqualified for any office but that of complaint. <lb/>
With great difficulty she was made to communicate the <lb/>
knowledge of her situation. Her visitant then passed into <lb/>
Baxter's apartment. She forced herself to endure this <lb/>
tremendous scene long enough to discover that it was <reg orig="hasten-|ing">hastening</reg> <lb/>
to a close. She left the house, and hastening to the <lb/>
proper office, engaged the immediate attendance of a hearse. <lb/>
Before the lapse of an hour, Baxter's lifeless remains were <lb/>
thrust into a coffin and conveyed away.</p>
<p>Constantia now exerted herself to comfort and encourage <lb/>
the survivors. Her remonstrances incited Sarah to perform <lb/>
with alacrity the measures which prudence dictates on these <lb/>
occasions. The house was purified by the admission of air <lb/>
and the sprinkling of vinegar. Constantia applied her own <lb/>
hand to these tasks, and set her humble friend an example <lb/>
of forethought and activity. Sarah would not consent to <lb/>
part with her till a late hour in the evening.</p>
<p>These exertions had like to have been fatally injurious to <lb/>
Constantia. Her health was not sufficiently confirmed to <lb/>
sustain offices so arduous. In the course of the night her <lb/>
fatigue terminated in fever. In the present more salubrious <lb/>
state of the atmosphere, it assumed no malignant symptoms, <lb/>
and shortly disappeared. During her indisposition, she was <lb/>
attended by Sarah, in whose honest bosom no sentiment was <lb/>
more lively than gratitude. Constantia having promised to <lb/>
<pb n="55" entity="eaf033v5_0068" pid="uva-lib:350334"/>
renew her visit the next day, had been impatiently expected, <lb/>
and Sarah had come to her dwelling in the evening, full of <lb/>
foreboding and anxiety, to ascertain the cause of her delay. <lb/>
Having gained the bedside of her patroness, no <reg orig="considera-|tion">consideration</reg> <lb/>
could induce her to retire from it.</p>
<p>Constantia's curiosity was naturally excited as to the <lb/>
causes of Baxter's disease. The simple hearted Sarah was <lb/>
prolix and minute in the history of her own affairs. No <lb/>
theme was more congenial to her temper than that which <lb/>
was now proposed. In spite of redundance and obscurity <lb/>
in the style of the narrative, Constantia found in it powerful <lb/>
excitements of her sympathy. The tale, on its own account, <lb/>
as well as from the connexion of some of its incidents with <lb/>
a subsequent part of these memoirs, is worthy to be here <reg orig="in-|serted">inserted</reg>. <lb/>
However foreign the destiny of Monrose may at <lb/>
present appear to the story of the Dudleys, there will <reg orig="here-|after">hereafter</reg> <lb/>
be discovered an intimate connexion between them.</p>

<head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Adjacent</hi> to the house occupied by Baxter was an <reg orig="an-|tique">antique</reg> <lb/>
brick tenement. It was one of the first erections made <lb/>
by the followers of William Penn. It had the honor to be <lb/>
used as the temporary residence of that venerable person. <lb/>
Its moss-grown penthouse, crumbling walls, and ruinous <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">porch,</hi> made it an interesting and picturesque object. <reg orig="Not-|withstanding">Notwithstanding</reg> <lb/>
its age, it was still tenable.</p>
<p>This house was occupied, during the preceding months, <lb/>
by a Frenchman. His dress and demeanor were <reg orig="respecta-|ble">respectable</reg>. <lb/>
His mode of life was frugal almost to penuriousness, <lb/>
and his only companion was a daughter. The lady seemed <lb/>
not much less than thirty years of age, but was of a small <lb/>
and delicate frame. It was she that performed every <reg orig="house-|hold">household</reg> <lb/>
office. She brought water from the pump and <reg orig="provi-|sions">provisions</reg> <lb/>
from the market. Their house had no visitants, and <lb/>
was almost always closed. Duly, as the morning returned, <lb/>
a venerable figure was seen issuing from his door, dressed <lb/>
in the same style of tarnished splendor and old fashioned <lb/>
<pb n="56" entity="eaf033v5_0069" pid="uva-lib:350335"/>
preciseness. At the dinner hour he as regularly returned. <lb/>
For the rest of the day he was invisible.</p>
<p>The habitations in this quarter are few and scattered. <lb/>
The pestilence soon showed itself here, and the flight of <lb/>
most of the inhabitants, augmented its desolateness and <reg orig="drear-|iness">dreariness</reg>. <lb/>
For some time, Monrose, that was his name, made <lb/>
his usual appearance in the morning. At length the <reg orig="neigh-|bors">neighbors</reg> <lb/>
remarked that he no longer came forth as usual. <reg orig="Bax-|ter">Baxter</reg> <lb/>
had a notion that Frenchmen were exempt from this <reg orig="dis-|ease">disease</reg>. <lb/>
He was, besides, deeply and rancorously prejudiced <lb/>
against that nation. There will be no difficulty in <reg orig="account-|ing">accounting</reg> <lb/>
for this, when it is known that he had been an English <lb/>
grenadier at Dettingen and Minden. It must likewise be <lb/>
added, that he was considerably timid, and had sickness in <lb/>
his own family. Hence it was that the disappearance of <lb/>
Monrose excited in him no inquisitiveness as to the cause. <lb/>
He did not even mention this circumstance to others.</p>
<p>The lady was occasionally seen as usual in the street. <lb/>
There were always remarkable peculiarities in her behaviour. <lb/>
In the midst of grave and disconsolate looks, she never laid <lb/>
aside an air of solemn dignity. She seemed to shrink from <lb/>
the observation of others, and her eyes were always fixed <lb/>
upon the ground. One evening Baxter was passing the <lb/>
pump while she was drawing water. The sadness which <lb/>
her looks betokened, and a suspicion that her father might <lb/>
be sick, had a momentary effect upon his feelings. He <lb/>
stopped and asked how her father was. She paid a polite <lb/>
attention to his question, and said something in French. <lb/>
This and the embarrassment of her air, convinced him that <lb/>
his words were not understood. He said no more (what <reg orig="in-|deed">indeed</reg> <lb/>
could he say?) but passed on.</p>
<p>Two or three days after this, on returning in the evening <lb/>
to his family, his wife expressed her surprise in not having <lb/>
seen Miss Monrose in the street that day. She had not been <lb/>
at the pump, nor had gone, as usual, to market. This <reg orig="in-|formation">information</reg> <lb/>
gave him some disquiet; yet he could form no <reg orig="re-|solution">resolution</reg>. <lb/>
As to entering the house and offering his aid, if <lb/>
aid were needed, he had too much regard for his own safety, <lb/>
and too little for that of a frog-eating Frenchman, to think <lb/>
seriously of that expedient. His attention was speedily <reg orig="di-|verted">diverted</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="57" entity="eaf033v5_0070" pid="uva-lib:350336"/>
by other objects, and Monrose was, for the present, <lb/>
forgotten.</p>
<p>Baxter's profession was that of a porter. He was thrown <lb/>
out of employment by the present state of things. The <reg orig="so-|licitude">solicitude</reg> <lb/>
of the guardians of the city was exerted on this <reg orig="oc-|casion">occasion</reg>, <lb/>
not only in opposing the progress of disease, and <lb/>
furnishing provisions to the destitute, but in the preservation <lb/>
of property. For this end the number of nightly watchmen <lb/>
was increased. Baxter entered himself in this service. From <lb/>
nine till twelve o'clock at night it was his province to occupy <lb/>
a certain post.</p>
<p>On this night he attended his post as usual. Twelve <lb/>
o'clock arrived, and he bent his steps homeward. It was <lb/>
necessary to pass by Monrose's door. On approaching this <lb/>
house, the circumstance mentioned by his wife recurred to <lb/>
him. Something like compassion was conjured up in his <lb/>
heart by the figure of the lady, as he recollected to have <lb/>
lately seen it. It was obvious to conclude that sickness was <lb/>
the cause of her seclusion. The same, it might be, had <lb/>
confined her father. If this were true, how deplorable might <lb/>
be their present condition! Without food, without physician <lb/>
or friends, ignorant of the language of the country, and thence <lb/>
unable to communicate their wants or solicit succor; <reg orig="fugi-|tives">fugitives</reg> <lb/>
from their native land, neglected, solitary, and poor.</p>
<p>His heart was softened by these images. He stopped <reg orig="in-|voluntarily">involuntarily</reg> <lb/>
when opposite their door. He looked up at the <lb/>
house. The shutters were closed, so that light, if it were <lb/>
within, was invisible. He stepped into the porch, and put <lb/>
his eye to the key hole. All was darksome and waste. He <lb/>
listened and imagined that he heard the aspirations of grief. <lb/>
The sound was scarcely articulate, but had an electrical <lb/>
effect upon his feelings. He retired to his home full of <lb/>
mournful reflections.</p>
<p>He was willing to do something for the relief of the <reg orig="suf-|ferers">sufferers</reg>, <lb/>
but nothing could be done that night. Yet succor, <lb/>
if delayed till the morning, might be ineffectual. But how, <lb/>
when the morning came, should he proceed to effectuate his <lb/>
kind intentions? The guardians of the public welfare, at <lb/>
this crisis, were distributed into those who counselled and <lb/>
those who executed. A set of men, self appointed to the <lb/>
generous office, employed themselves in seeking out the <reg orig="des-|titute">destitute</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="58" entity="eaf033v5_0071" pid="uva-lib:350337"/>
or sick, and imparting relief. With this arrangement, <lb/>
Baxter was acquainted. He was resolved to carry tidings <lb/>
of what he had heard and seen to one of those persons early <lb/>
the next day.</p>
<p>Baxter, after taking some refreshment, retired to rest. In <lb/>
no long time, however, he was awakened by his wife, who <lb/>
desired him to notice a certain glimmering on the ceiling. It <lb/>
seemed the feeble and flitting ray of a distant and moving <lb/>
light, coming through the window. It did not proceed from <lb/>
the street, for the chamber was lighted from the side, and <lb/>
not from the front of the house. A lamp borne by a <reg orig="pas-|senger">passenger</reg>, <lb/>
or the attendants of a hearse, could not be <reg orig="discov-|ered">discovered</reg> <lb/>
in this situation. Besides, in the latter case, it would <lb/>
be accompanied by the sound of the vehicle, and probably, <lb/>
by weeping and exclamations of despair. His employment, <lb/>
as the guardian of property, naturally suggested to him the <lb/>
idea of robbery. He started from his bed, and went to the <lb/>
window.</p>
<p>His house stood at the distance of about fifty paces from <lb/>
that of Monrose. There was annexed to the latter, a small <lb/>
garden or yard, bounded by a high wooden fence. <reg orig="Bax-|ter's">Baxter's</reg> <lb/>
window overlooked this space. Before he reached the <lb/>
window, the relative situation of the two habitations occurred <lb/>
to him. A conjecture was instantly formed that the <reg orig="glim-|mering">glimmering</reg> <lb/>
proceeded from this quarter. His eye, therefore, <lb/>
was immediately fixed upon Monrose's back door. It caught <lb/>
a glimpse of a human figure, passing into the house, through <lb/>
this door. The person had a candle in his hand. This <reg orig="ap-|peared">appeared</reg> <lb/>
by the light which streamed after him, and which <lb/>
was perceived, though faintly, through a small window of the <lb/>
dwelling, after the back door was closed.</p>
<p>The person disappeared too quickly to allow him to say <lb/>
whether it was male or female. This scrutiny confirmed, <lb/>
rather than weakened the apprehensions that first occurred. <lb/>
He reflected on the desolate and helpless condition of this <lb/>
family. The father might be sick; and what opposition <lb/>
could be made by the daughter to the stratagems or violence <lb/>
of midnight plunderers. This was an evil which it was his <lb/>
duty, in an extraordinary sense, to obviate. It is true, the <lb/>
hour of watching was passed, and this was not the district <lb/>
assigned to him; but Baxter was, on the whole, of a <reg orig="gene-|rous">generous</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="59" entity="eaf033v5_0072" pid="uva-lib:350338"/>
and intrepid spirit. In the present case, therefore, he <lb/>
did not hesitate long in forming his resolution. He seized <lb/>
a hanger that hung at his bedside, and which had hewn <lb/>
many a Hungarian and French hussar to pieces. With this <lb/>
he descended to the street. He cautiously approached <reg orig="Mon-|rose's">Monrose's</reg> <lb/>
house. He listened at the door, but heard nothing. <lb/>
The lower apartment, as he discovered through the key hole, <lb/>
was deserted and dark. These appearances could not be <lb/>
accounted for. He was, as yet, unwilling to call or to knock. <lb/>
He was solicitous to obtain some information by silent means, <lb/>
and without alarming the persons within, who, if they were <lb/>
robbers, might thus be put upon their guard, and enabled to <lb/>
escape. If none but the family were there, they would not <lb/>
understand his signals, and might impute the disturbance to <lb/>
the cause which he was desirous to obviate. What could he <lb/>
do? Must he patiently wait till some incident should <reg orig="hap-|pen">happen</reg> <lb/>
to regulate his motions?</p>
<p>In this uncertainty, he bethought himself of going round to <lb/>
the back part of the dwelling, and watching the door which <lb/>
had been closed. An open space, filled with rubbish and <lb/>
weeds, adjoined the house and garden on one side. Hither <lb/>
he repaired, and raising his head above the fence, at a point <lb/>
directly opposite the door, waited with considerable <reg orig="impa-|tience">impatience</reg> <lb/>
for some token or signal, by which he might be <reg orig="direct-|ed">directed</reg> <lb/>
in his choice of measures.</p>
<p>Human life abounds with mysterious appearances. A <lb/>
man, perched on a fence, at midnight, mute and motionless, <lb/>
and gazing at a dark and dreary dwelling, was an object <reg orig="cal-|culated">calculated</reg> <lb/>
to rouse curiosity. When the muscular form, and <lb/>
rugged visage, scarred and furrowed into something like <reg orig="fe-|rocity">ferocity</reg>, <lb/>
were added; when the nature of the calamity, by <lb/>
which the city was dispeopled, was considered, the motives <lb/>
to plunder, and the insecurity of property, arising from the <lb/>
pressure of new wants on the poor, and the flight or disease <lb/>
of the rich, were attended to, an observer would be apt to <lb/>
admit fearful conjectures.</p>
<p>We know not how long Baxter continued at this post. <lb/>
He remained here, because he could not, as he conceived, <lb/>
change it for a better. Before his patience was exhausted, <lb/>
his attention was called by a noise within the house. It <reg orig="pro-|ceeded">proceeded</reg> <lb/>
from the lower room. The sound was that of steps, <lb/>
<pb n="60" entity="eaf033v5_0073" pid="uva-lib:350339"/>
but this was accompanied with other inexplicable tokens. <lb/>
The kitchen door at length opened. The figure of Miss <lb/>
Monrose, pale, emaciated, and haggard, presented itself. <lb/>
Within the door stood a candle. It was placed on a chair <lb/>
within sight, and its rays streamed directly against the face <lb/>
of Baxter, as it was reared above the top of the fence. This <lb/>
illumination, faint as it was, bestowed a certain air of <reg orig="wild-|ness">wildness</reg> <lb/>
on features which nature, and the sanguinary habits of <lb/>
a soldier, had previously rendered, in an eminent degree, <lb/>
harsh and stern. He was not aware of the danger of <reg orig="dis-|covery">discovery</reg>, <lb/>
in consequence of this position of the candle. His <lb/>
attention was, for a few seconds, engrossed by the object <lb/>
before him. At length he chanced to notice another object.</p>
<p>At a few yards distance from the fence, and within it, <lb/>
some one appeared to have been digging. An opening was <lb/>
made in the ground, but it was shallow and irregular. The <lb/>
implement which seemed to have been used, was nothing <lb/>
more than a fire shovel, for one of these he observed lying <lb/>
near the spot. The lady had withdrawn from the door, <lb/>
though without closing it. He had leisure, therefore, to <reg orig="at-|tend">attend</reg> <lb/>
to this new circumstance, and to reflect upon the <reg orig="pur-|pose">purpose</reg> <lb/>
for which this opening might have been designed.</p>
<p>Death is familiar to the apprehensions of a soldier. <reg orig="Bax-|ter">Baxter</reg> <lb/>
had assisted at the hasty interment of thousands, the <reg orig="vic-|tims">victims</reg> <lb/>
of the sword or of pestilence. Whether it was because <lb/>
this theatre of human calamity was new to him, and death, <lb/>
in order to be viewed with his ancient unconcern, must be <lb/>
accompanied in the ancient manner, with halberts and tents, <lb/>
certain it is, that Baxter was irresolute and timid in every <lb/>
thing that respected the yellow fever. The circumstances <lb/>
of the time suggested that this was a grave, to which some <lb/>
victim of this disease was to be consigned. His teeth <reg orig="chat-|tered">chattered</reg> <lb/>
when he reflected how near he might now be to the <lb/>
source of infection; yet his curiosity retained him at his <lb/>
post.</p>
<p>He fixed his eyes once more upon the door. In a short <lb/>
time the lady again appeared at it. She was in a stooping <lb/>
posture, and appeared to be dragging something along the <lb/>
floor. His blood ran cold at this spectacle. His fear <reg orig="in-|stantly">instantly</reg> <lb/>
figured to itself a corpse, livid and contagious. Still <lb/>
he had no power to move. The lady's strength, enfeebled <lb/>
<pb n="61" entity="eaf033v5_0074" pid="uva-lib:350340"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">6</fw></pb>
as it was by grief, and perhaps by the absence of <reg orig="nourish-|ment">nourishment</reg>, <lb/>
seemed scarcely adequate to the task which she had <lb/>
assigned herself.</p>
<p>Her burthen, whatever it was, was closely wrapt in a <lb/>
sheet. She drew it forward a few paces, then desisted, and <lb/>
seated herself on the ground, apparently to recruit her <lb/>
strength, and give vent to the agony of her thoughts in sighs. <lb/>
Her tears were either exhausted or refused to flow, for none <lb/>
were shed by her. Presently she resumed her undertaking. <lb/>
Baxter's horror increased in proportion as she drew nearer <lb/>
to the spot where he stood, and yet it seemed as if some <reg orig="fas-|cination">fascination</reg> <lb/>
had forbidden him to recede.</p>
<p>At length the burthen was drawn to the side of the <reg orig="open-|ing">opening</reg> <lb/>
in the earth. Here it seemed as if the mournful task <lb/>
was finished. She threw herself once more upon the earth. <lb/>
Her senses seemed for a time to have forsaken her. She <lb/>
sat buried in reverie, her eyes scarcely open and fixed upon <lb/>
the ground, and every feature set to the genuine expression <lb/>
of sorrow. Some disorder, occasioned by the circumstance <lb/>
of dragging, now took place in the vestment of what he had <lb/>
rightly predicted to be a dead body. The veil by accident <lb/>
was drawn aside, and exhibited, to the startled eye of <reg orig="Bax-|ter">Baxter</reg>, <lb/>
the pale and ghastly visage of the unhappy Monrose.</p>
<p>This incident determined him. Every joint in his frame <lb/>
trembled, and he hastily withdrew from the fence. His first <lb/>
motion in doing this produced a noise by which the lady was <lb/>
alarmed; she suddenly threw her eyes upward, and gained <lb/>
a full view of Baxter's extraordinary countenance, just <reg orig="be-|fore">before</reg> <lb/>
it disappeared. She manifested her terror by a <reg orig="pierc-|ing">piercing</reg> <lb/>
shriek. Baxter did not stay to mark her subsequent <lb/>
conduct, to confirm or to dissipate her fears, but retired, in <lb/>
confusion, to his own house.</p>
<p>Hitherto his caution had availed him. He had carefully <lb/>
avoided all employments and places from which he imagined <lb/>
imminent danger was to be dreaded. Now, through his <lb/>
own inadvertency, he had rushed, as he believed, into the <lb/>
jaws of the pest. His senses had not been assailed by any <lb/>
noisome effluvia. This was no unplausible ground for <reg orig="im-|agining">imagining</reg> <lb/>
that his death had some other cause than the yellow <lb/>
fever. This circumstance did not occur to Baxter. He <lb/>
<pb n="62" entity="eaf033v5_0075" pid="uva-lib:350341"/>
had been told that Frenchmen were not susceptible of this <lb/>
contagion. He had hitherto believed this assertion, but now <lb/>
regarded it as having been fully confuted. He forgot that <lb/>
Frenchmen were undoubtedly mortal, and that there was no <lb/>
impossibility in Monrose's dying, even at this time, of a <reg orig="mal-|ady">malady</reg> <lb/>
different from that which prevailed.</p>
<p>Before morning he began to feel very unpleasant <reg orig="symp-|toms">symptoms</reg>. <lb/>
He related his late adventure to his wife. She <reg orig="en-|deavored">endeavored</reg>, <lb/>
by what arguments her slender ingenuity <reg orig="sug-|gested">suggested</reg>, <lb/>
to quiet his apprehensions, but in vain. He hourly <lb/>
grew worse, and as soon as it was light, despatched his wife <lb/>
for a physician. On interrogating this messenger, the <reg orig="phy-|sician">physician</reg> <lb/>
obtained information of last night's occurrences, and <lb/>
this being communicated to one of the dispensers of the <reg orig="pub-|lic">public</reg> <lb/>
charity, they proceeded, early in the morning, to <reg orig="Mon-|rose's">Monrose's</reg> <lb/>
house. It was closed as usual. They knocked and <lb/>
called, but no one answered. They examined every avenue <lb/>
to the dwelling, but none of them were accessible. They <lb/>
passed into the garden, and observed, on the spot marked <lb/>
out by Baxter, a heap of earth. A very slight exertion was <lb/>
sufficient to remove it and discover the body of the <reg orig="unfortu-|nate">unfortunate</reg> <lb/>
exile beneath.</p>
<p>After unsuccessfully trying various expedients for entering <lb/>
the house, they deemed themselves authorized to break the <lb/>
door. They entered, ascended the staircase, and searched <lb/>
every apartment in the house, but no human being was <reg orig="dis-|coverable">discoverable</reg>. <lb/>
The furniture was wretched and scanty, but <lb/>
there was no proof that Monrose had fallen a victim to the <lb/>
reigning disease. It was certain that the lady had <reg orig="disappear-|ed">disappeared</reg>. <lb/>
It was inconceivable whither she had gone.</p>
<p>Baxter suffered a long period of sickness. The <reg orig="prevail-|ing">prevailing</reg> <lb/>
malady appeared upon him in its severest form. His <lb/>
strength of constitution, and the careful attendance of his <lb/>
wife, were insufficient to rescue him from the grave. His <lb/>
case may be quoted as an example of the force of <reg orig="imagina-|tion">imagination</reg>. <lb/>
He had probably already received, through the <reg orig="me-|dium">medium</reg> <lb/>
of the air, or by contact of which he was not <reg orig="con-|scious">conscious</reg>, <lb/>
the seeds of this disease. They might perhaps have <lb/>
lain dormant, had not this panic occurred to endow them <lb/>
with activity.</p>

<head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Such</hi> were the facts circumstantially communicated by <lb/>
Sarah. They afforded to Constantia a theme of ardent <reg orig="med-|itation">meditation</reg>. <lb/>
The similitude between her own destiny and that <lb/>
of this unhappy exile, could not fail to be observed. <reg orig="Im-|mersed">Immersed</reg> <lb/>
in poverty, friendless, burthened with the <reg orig="mainte-|nance">maintenance</reg> <lb/>
and nurture of her father, their circumstances were <lb/>
nearly parallel. The catastrophe of her tale, was the <reg orig="sub-|ject">subject</reg> <lb/>
of endless but unsatisfactory conjecture.</p>
<p>She had disappeared between the flight of Baxter and the <lb/>
dawn of day. What path had she taken? Was she now <lb/>
alive? Was she still an inhabitant of this city? Perhaps <lb/>
there was a coincidence of taste as well as fortunes between <lb/>
them. The only friend that Constantia ever enjoyed, <reg orig="con-|genial">congenial</reg> <lb/>
with her in principles, sex and age, was at a distance <lb/>
that forbade communication. She imagined that Ursula <reg orig="Mon-|rose">Monrose</reg> <lb/>
would prove worthy of her love, and felt unspeakable <lb/>
regret at the improbability of their ever meeting.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the dominion of cold began to be felt, and the <lb/>
contagious fever entirely disappeared. The return of health <lb/>
was hailed with rapture, by all ranks of people. The streets <lb/>
were once more busy and frequented. The sensation of <lb/>
present security seemed to shut out from all hearts the <reg orig="mem-|ory">memory</reg> <lb/>
of recent disasters. Public entertainments were <reg orig="throng-|ed">thronged</reg> <lb/>
with auditors. A new theatre had lately been <reg orig="construct-|ed">constructed</reg>, <lb/>
and a company of English Comedians had arrived <reg orig="dur-|ing">during</reg> <lb/>
the prevalence of the malady. They now began their <lb/>
exhibitions, and their audiences were overflowing.</p>
<p>Such is the motly and ambiguous condition of human <lb/>
society, such is the complexity of all effects from what <lb/>
cause soever they spring, that none can tell whether this <lb/>
destructive pestilence was, on the whole, productive of most <lb/>
pain or most pleasure. Those who had been sick and had <lb/>
recovered, found, in this circumstance, a source of <reg orig="exulta-|tion">exultation</reg>. <lb/>
Others made haste, by new marriages, to supply the <lb/>
place of wives, husbands and children, whom the scarcely <lb/>
extinguished pestilence had swept away.</p>
<p>Constantia, however, was permitted to take no share in <lb/>
the general festivity. Such was the color of her fate, that <lb/>
<pb n="64" entity="eaf033v5_0077" pid="uva-lib:350343"/>
the yellow fever, by affording her a respite from toil, <reg orig="supply-|ing">supplying</reg> <lb/>
leisure for the acquisition of a useful branch of <reg orig="know-|ledge">knowledge</reg>, <lb/>
and leading her to the discovery of a cheaper, more <lb/>
simple, and more wholesome method of subsistence, had <lb/>
been friendly, instead of adverse, to her happiness. Its <lb/>
disappearance, instead of relieving her from suffering, was <lb/>
the signal for the approach of new cares.</p>
<p>Of her ancient customers, some were dead, and others <lb/>
were slow in resuming their ancient habitations, and their <lb/>
ordinary habits. Meanwhile two wants were now created <lb/>
and were urgent. The season demanded a supply of fuel, <lb/>
and her rent had accumulated beyond her power to <reg orig="dis-|charge">discharge</reg>. <lb/>
M'Crea no sooner returned from the country, than <lb/>
he applied to her for payment. Some proprietors, guided <lb/>
by humanity, had remitted their dues, but M'Crea was not <lb/>
one of these. According to his own representation, no man <lb/>
was poorer than himself, and the punctual payment of all <lb/>
that was owing to him, was no more than sufficient to afford <lb/>
him a scanty subsistence.</p>
<p>He was aware of the indigence of the Dudleys, and was <lb/>
therefore extremely importunate for payment, and could <lb/>
scarcely be prevailed upon to allow them the interval of a <lb/>
day, for the discovery of expedients. This day was passed <lb/>
by Constantia in fruitless anxieties. The ensuing evening <lb/>
had been fixed for a repetition of his visit. The hour <lb/>
arrived, but her invention was exhausted in vain. M'Crea <lb/>
was punctual to the minute. Constantia was allowed no <lb/>
option. She merely declared that the money demanded <lb/>
she had not to give, nor could she foresee any period at <lb/>
which her inability would be less than it then was.</p>
<p>These declarations were heard by her visitant, with marks <lb/>
of unspeakable vexation. He did not fail to expatiate on <lb/>
the equity of his demands, the moderation and forbearance <lb/>
he had hitherto shewn, notwithstanding the extreme urgency <lb/>
of his own wants, and the inflexible rigor with which he had <lb/>
been treated by <hi rend="italic">his</hi> creditors. This rhetoric was merely <lb/>
the prelude to an intimation that he must avail himself of <lb/>
any lawful means, by which he might gain possession of <hi rend="italic">his <lb/>
own.</hi></p>
<p>This insinuation was fully comprehended by Constantia, <lb/>
but it was heard without any new emotions. Her <reg orig="know-|ledge">knowledge</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="65" entity="eaf033v5_0078" pid="uva-lib:350344"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">6*</fw></pb>
of her landlord's character taught her to expect but <lb/>
one consequence. He paused to observe what effect would <lb/>
be produced by this indirect menace. She answered, <reg orig="with-|out">without</reg> <lb/>
any change of tone, that the loss of habitation and <lb/>
furniture, however inconvenient at this season, must be <lb/>
patiently endured. If it were to be prevented only by the <lb/>
payment of money, its prevention was impossible.</p>
<p>M'Crea renewed his regrets, that there should be no other <lb/>
alternative. The law sanctioned his claims, and justice to <lb/>
his family, which was already large, and likely to increase, <lb/>
required that they should not be relinquished, yet such was <lb/>
the mildness of his temper and his aversion to proceed to <lb/>
this extremity, that he was willing to dispense with immediate <lb/>
payment on two conditions. First, that they should leave <lb/>
his house within a week, and secondly, that they should <lb/>
put into his hands some trinket or moveable, equal in value <lb/>
to the sum demanded, which should be kept by him as a <lb/>
pledge.</p>
<p>This last hint suggested an expedient for obviating the <lb/>
present distress. The lute with which Mr. Dudley was <lb/>
accustomed to solace his solitude, was, if possible, more <lb/>
essential to his happiness than shelter or food. To his <lb/>
daughter it possessed little direct power to please. It was <lb/>
inestimable merely for her father's sake. Its intrinsic value <lb/>
was at least equal to the sum due, but to part with it was to <lb/>
bereave him of a good, which nothing else could supply. <lb/>
Besides, not being a popular and saleable instrument, it <lb/>
would probably be contemptuously rejected by the ignorance <lb/>
and avarice of M'Crea.</p>
<p>There was another article in her possession, of some value <lb/>
in traffic, and of a kind which M'Crea was far more likely <lb/>
to accept. It was the miniature portrait of her friend, <lb/>
executed by a German artist, and set in gold. This image <lb/>
was a precious though imperfect substitute for sympathy and <lb/>
intercourse with the original. Habit had made this picture <lb/>
a source of a species of idolatry. Its power over her <lb/>
sensations was similar to that possessed by a beautiful <lb/>
Madonna over the heart of a juvenile enthusiast. It was the <lb/>
mother of the only devotion which her education had taught <lb/>
her to consider as beneficial or true.</p>
<pb n="66" entity="eaf033v5_0079" pid="uva-lib:350345"/>
<p>She perceived the necessity of parting with it on this <lb/>
occasion, with the utmost clearness, but this necessity was <lb/>
thought upon with indescribable repugnance. It seemed as if <lb/>
she had not thoroughly conceived the extent of her <reg orig="calami-|ty">calamity</reg> <lb/>
till now. It seemed as if she could have endured the <lb/>
loss of eyes with less reluctance than the loss of this <reg orig="inesti-|mable">inestimable</reg> <lb/>
relic. Bitter were the tears which she shed over <lb/>
it as she took it from her bosom, and consigned it to those <lb/>
rapacious hands, that were stretched out to receive it. She <lb/>
derived some little consolation from the promises of this man, <lb/>
that he would keep it safely till she was able to redeem it.</p>
<p>The other condition, that of immediate removal from the <lb/>
house, seemed at first sight impracticable. Some reflection, <lb/>
however, shewed her, that the change might not only be <lb/>
possible but useful. Among other expedients for diminishing <lb/>
expense, that of limiting her furniture and dwelling to the <lb/>
cheapest standard, had often occurred. She now <reg orig="remem-|bered">remembered</reg>, <lb/>
that the house occupied by Monrose, was tenantless; <lb/>
that its antiquity, its remote and unpleasant situation, and its <lb/>
small dimensions, might induce M'Crea, to whom it belonged, <lb/>
to let it at a much lower price than that which he now <reg orig="ex-|acted">exacted</reg>. <lb/>
M'Crea would have been better pleased if her <lb/>
choice had fallen on a different house, but he had powerful <lb/>
though sordid reasons for desiring the possession of this <lb/>
tenement. He assented therefore to her proposal, provided <lb/>
her removal took place without delay.</p>
<p>In the present state of her funds this removal was <reg orig="impos-|sible">impossible</reg>. <lb/>
Mere shelter, would not suffice during this inclement <lb/>
season. Without fuel, neither cold could be excluded, nor <lb/>
hunger relieved. There was nothing, convertible into money, <lb/>
but her lute. No sacrifice was more painful, but an <reg orig="irresist-|ible">irresistible</reg> <lb/>
necessity demanded it.</p>
<p>Her interview with M'Crea took place while her father <lb/>
was absent from the room. On his return she related what <lb/>
had happened, and urged the necessity of parting with his <lb/>
favorite instrument. He listened to her tale with a sigh. <lb/>
Yes, said he, do what thou wilt, my child. It is unlikely <lb/>
that any one will purchase it. It is certain that no one will <lb/>
give for it what I gave; but thou may'st try.</p>
<p>It has been to me a faithful friend. I know not how I <lb/>
should have lived without it. Its notes have cheered me <lb/>
<pb n="67" entity="eaf033v5_0080" pid="uva-lib:350346"/>
with the sweet remembrances of old times. It was, in some <lb/>
degree, a substitute for the eyes which I have lost, but now <lb/>
let it go, and perform for me perhaps the dearest of its <lb/>
services. It may help us to sustain the severities of this <lb/>
season.</p>
<p>There was no room for delay. She immediately set out <lb/>
in search of a purchaser. Such a one was most likely to <lb/>
be found in the keeper of a musical repository, who had <lb/>
lately arrived from Europe. She entertained but slight <lb/>
hopes that an instrument, scarcely known among her <reg orig="neigh-|bors">neighbors</reg>, <lb/>
would be bought at any price, however inconsiderable.</p>
<p>She found the keeper of the shop engaged in <reg orig="conversa-|tion">conversation</reg> <lb/>
with a lady, whose person and face instantly arrested <lb/>
the attention of Constantia. A less sagacious observer <lb/>
would have eyed the stranger with indifference. But <reg orig="Con-|stantia">Constantia</reg> <lb/>
was ever busy in interpreting the language of features <lb/>
and looks. Her sphere of observation had been narrow, <lb/>
but her habits of examining, comparing and deducing, had <lb/>
thoroughly exhausted that sphere. These habits were <lb/>
eminently strong, with relation to this class of objects. She <lb/>
delighted to investigate the human countenance, and <reg orig="trea-|sured">treasured</reg> <lb/>
up numberless conclusions as to the coincidence <reg orig="be-|tween">between</reg> <lb/>
mental and external qualities.</p>
<p>She had often been forcibly struck by forms that were <lb/>
accidentally seen, and which abounded with this species of <lb/>
mute expression. They conveyed at a single glance, what <lb/>
could not be imparted by volumes. The features and shape <lb/>
sunk, as it were, into perfect harmony with sentiments and <lb/>
passions. Every atom of the frame was pregnant with <lb/>
significance. In some, nothing was remarkable but this <lb/>
power of the outward figure to exhibit the internal <reg orig="senti-|ments">sentiments</reg>. <lb/>
In others, the intelligence thus unveiled, was <reg orig="re-|markable">remarkable</reg> <lb/>
for its heterogeneous or energetic qualities; for its <lb/>
tendency to fill her heart with veneration or abhorrence, or <lb/>
to involve her in endless perplexities.</p>
<p>The accuracy and vividness with which pictures of this <lb/>
kind presented themselves to her imagination, resembled the <lb/>
operations of a sixth sense. It cannot be doubted, however, <lb/>
that much was owing to the enthusiastic tenor of her own <lb/>
conceptions, and that her conviction of the truth of the <lb/>
<pb n="68" entity="eaf033v5_0081" pid="uva-lib:350347"/>
picture, principally flowed from the distinctness and strength <lb/>
of its hues.</p>
<p>The figure which she now examined, was small but of <lb/>
exquisite proportions. Her complexion testified the influence <lb/>
of a torrid sun, but the darkness veiled, without obscuring, <lb/>
the glowing tints of her cheek. The shade was remarkably <lb/>
deep, but a deeper still was required to become <reg orig="incompati-|ble">incompatible</reg> <lb/>
with beauty. Her features were irregular, but defects of <lb/>
symmetry were amply supplied by eyes that anticipated <lb/>
speech, and positions which conveyed that to which language <lb/>
was inadequate.</p>
<p>It was not the chief tendency of her appearance to seduce <lb/>
or to melt. Her's were the polished cheek and the <reg orig="muta-|bility">mutability</reg> <lb/>
of muscle, which belong to woman, but the genius <lb/>
conspicuous in her aspect, was heroic and contemplative. <lb/>
The female was absorbed, so to speak, in the rational <reg orig="crea-|ture">creature</reg>, <lb/>
and the emotions most apt to be excited in the gazer, <lb/>
partook less of love than of reverence.</p>
<p>Such is the portrait of this stranger, delineated by <reg orig="Con-|stantia">Constantia</reg>. <lb/>
I copy it with greater willingness, because if we <lb/>
substitute a nobler stature, and a complexion less uniform <lb/>
and delicate, it is suited, with the utmost accuracy, to <reg orig="her-|self">herself</reg>. <lb/>
She was probably unconscious of this resemblance, <lb/>
but this circumstance may be supposed to influence her in <lb/>
discovering such attractive properties in a form thus vaguely <lb/>
seen. These impressions, permanent and cogent as they <lb/>
were, were gained at a single glance. The purpose which <lb/>
led her thither was too momentous to be long excluded.</p>
<p>Why, said the master of the shop, this is lucky. Here <lb/>
is a lady who has just been inquiring for an instrument of <lb/>
this kind. Perhaps the one you have will suit her. If you <lb/>
will bring it to me, I will examine it, and if it is complete, <lb/>
will make a bargain with you.&mdash;He then turned to the lady <lb/>
who had first entered, and a short dialogue in French ensued <lb/>
between them. The man repeated his assurances to <reg orig="Con-|stantia">Constantia</reg>, <lb/>
who, promising to hasten back with the instrument, <lb/>
took her leave. The lute, in its structure and ornaments, <lb/>
has rarely been surpassed. When scrutinized by this artist, <lb/>
it proved to be complete, and the price demanded for it was <lb/>
readily given.</p>
<p>By this means the Dudleys were enabled to change their <lb/>
<pb n="69" entity="eaf033v5_0082" pid="uva-lib:350348"/>
habitation, and to supply themselves with fuel. To obviate <lb/>
future exigencies, Constantia betook herself, once more, to <lb/>
the needle. They persisted in the use of their simple fare, <lb/>
and endeavored to contract their wants and methodize their <lb/>
occupations, by a standard as rigid as possible. She had <lb/>
not relinquished her design of adopting a new and more <lb/>
liberal profession, but though, when indistinctly and generally <lb/>
considered, it seemed easily effected, yet the first steps <lb/>
which it would be proper to take, did not clearly or readily <lb/>
suggest themselves. For the present she was contented to <lb/>
pursue the beaten tract, but was prepared to benefit by any <lb/>
occasion that time might furnish, suitable to the execution of <lb/>
her plan.</p>

<head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">It</hi> may be asked, if a woman of this character did not <lb/>
attract the notice of the world. Her station, no less than <lb/>
her modes of thinking, excluded her from the concourse of <lb/>
the opulent and the gay. She kept herself in privacy, her <lb/>
engagements confined her to her own fireside, and her <lb/>
neighbors enjoyed no means of penetrating through that <lb/>
obscurity in which she wrapt herself. There were, no <lb/>
doubt, persons of her own sex, capable of estimating her <lb/>
worth, and who could have hastened to raise so much merit <lb/>
from the indigence to which it was condemned. She might, <lb/>
at least, have found associates and friends, justly entitled to <lb/>
her affection. But whether she were peculiarly unfortunate <lb/>
in this respect, or whether it arose from a jealous and <reg orig="un-|bending">unbending</reg> <lb/>
spirit that would remit none of its claims to respect, <lb/>
and was backward in its overtures to kindness and intimacy, <lb/>
it so happened that her hours were, for a long period, <reg orig="enliven-|ed">enlivened</reg> <lb/>
by no companion but her father and her faithful Lucy. <lb/>
The humbleness of her dwelling, her plain garb, and the <lb/>
meanness of her occupation, were no passports to the favor of <lb/>
the rich and vain. These, added to her youth and beauty, <lb/>
frequently exposed her to insults, from which, though <reg orig="pro-|ductive">productive</reg> <lb/>
for a time of mortification and distress, she, for the <lb/>
<pb n="70" entity="eaf033v5_0083" pid="uva-lib:350349"/>
most part, extricated herself by her spirited carriage, and <lb/>
presence of mind.</p>
<p>One incident of this kind it will be necessary to mention. <lb/>
One evening her engagements carried her abroad. She <lb/>
had proposed to return immediately, finding by experience <lb/>
the danger that was to be dreaded by a woman young and <lb/>
unprotected. Somewhat occurred that unavoidably <reg orig="length-|ened">lengthened</reg> <lb/>
her stay, and she set out on her return at a late hour. <lb/>
One of the other sex offered her his guardianship, but this <lb/>
she declined, and poceeded homeward alone.</p>
<p>Her way lay through streets but little inhabited, and <lb/>
whose few inhabitants were of the profligate class. She <lb/>
was conscious of the inconveniences to which she was <reg orig="ex-|posed">exposed</reg>, <lb/>
and therefore tripped along with all possible haste. <lb/>
She had not gone far before she perceived, through the <lb/>
dusk, two men standing near a porch before her. She had <lb/>
gone too far to recede or change her course without <reg orig="excit-|ing">exciting</reg> <lb/>
observation, and she flattered herself that the persons <lb/>
would behave with decency. Encouraged by these <reg orig="reflec-|tions">reflections</reg>, <lb/>
and somewhat hastening her pace, she went on. As <lb/>
soon as she came opposite the place where they stood, one <lb/>
of them threw himself round, and caught her arm, <reg orig="exclaim-|ing">exclaiming</reg>, <lb/>
in a broad tone, "Whither so fast, my love, at this time <lb/>
of night?" The other, at the same time, threw his arms <lb/>
round her waist, crying out, "A pretty prize, by G&mdash;; just <lb/>
in the nick of time."</p>
<p>They were huge and brawny fellows, in whose grasp her <lb/>
feeble strength was annihilated. Their motions were so <lb/>
sudden, that she had not time to escape by flight. Her <lb/>
struggles merely furnished them with a subject of laughter. <lb/>
He that held her waist, proceeded to pollute her cheeks <lb/>
with his kisses, and drew her into the porch. He tore her <lb/>
from the grasp of him who first seized her, who seemed to <lb/>
think his property invaded, and said, in a surly tone; "What <lb/>
now, Jemmy? Damn your heart, d'ye think I'll be fobbed? <lb/>
Have done with your slabbering, Jemmy. First come, first <lb/>
served;" and seemed disposed to assert his claims by force.</p>
<p>To this brutality, Constantia had nothing to oppose but <lb/>
fruitless struggles and shrieks for help. Succor was, <reg orig="for-|tunately">fortunately</reg>, <lb/>
at hand. Her exclamations were heard by a <reg orig="per-|son">person</reg> <lb/>
across the street, who instantly ran, and with some <reg orig="diffi-|culty">difficulty</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="71" entity="eaf033v5_0084" pid="uva-lib:350350"/>
disengaged her from the grasp of the ruffians. He <lb/>
accompanied her the rest of the way, bestowed on her <lb/>
every polite attention, and, though pressed to enter the <lb/>
house, declined the invitation. She had no opportunity of <lb/>
examining the appearance of her new friend. This, the <lb/>
darkness of the night and her own panic, prevented.</p>
<p>Next day a person called upon her whom she instantly <lb/>
recognized to be her late protector. He came with some <lb/>
message from his sister. His manners were simple and <reg orig="un-|ostentatious">unostentatious</reg>, <lb/>
and breathed the genuine spirit of civility. <lb/>
Having performed his commission, and once more received <lb/>
the thanks which she poured forth with peculiar warmth, <lb/>
for his last night's interposition, he took his leave.</p>
<p>The name of this man was Balfour. He was <reg orig="middle-|aged">middle-aged</reg>, <lb/>
of a figure neither elegant nor ungainly, and an aspect <lb/>
that was mild and placid, but betrayed few marks of <reg orig="intelli-|gence">intelligence</reg>. <lb/>
He was an adventurer from Scotland, whom a <lb/>
strict adherence to the maxims of trade had rendered <reg orig="opu-|lent">opulent</reg>. <lb/>
He was governed by the principles of mercantile <lb/>
integrity in all his dealings, and was affable and kind, <reg orig="with-|out">without</reg> <lb/>
being generous, in his treatment of inferiors. He was <lb/>
a stranger to violent emotions of any kind, and his <reg orig="intellec-|tual">intellectual</reg> <lb/>
acquisitions were limited to his own profession.</p>
<p>His demeanor was tranquil and uniform. He was sparing <lb/>
of words, and these were uttered in the softest manner. In <lb/>
all his transactions, he was sedate and considerate. In his <lb/>
dress and mode of living, there were no appearances of <reg orig="par-|simony">parsimony</reg>, <lb/>
but there were, likewise, as few traces of profusion.</p>
<p>His sister had shared in his prosperity. As soon as his <lb/>
affairs would permit, he sent for her to Scotland, where she <lb/>
had lived in a state little removed from penury, and had for <lb/>
some years, been vested with the superintendence of his <lb/>
household. There was a considerable resemblance between <lb/>
them in person and character. Her profession, or those <lb/>
arts in which her situation had compelled her to acquire <lb/>
skill, had not an equal tendency to enlarge the mind, as <lb/>
those of her brother, but the views of each were limited to <lb/>
one set of objects. His superiority was owing, not to any <lb/>
inherent difference, but to accident.</p>
<p>Balfour's life had been a model of chasteness and <reg orig="regular-|ity">regularity</reg>: <lb/>
though this was owing more to constitutional coldness <lb/>
<pb n="72" entity="eaf033v5_0085" pid="uva-lib:350351"/>
and a frugal spirit, than to virtuous forbearance; but, in his <lb/>
schemes for the future, he did not exclude the circumstance <lb/>
of marriage. Having attained a situation secure, as the <lb/>
nature of human affairs will admit, from the chances of <reg orig="pov-|erty">poverty</reg>, <lb/>
the way was sufficiently prepared for matrimony. His <lb/>
thoughts had been for some time employed in the selection <lb/>
of a suitable companion, when this rencounter happened with <lb/>
Miss Dudley.</p>
<p>Balfour was not destitute of those feelings which are <reg orig="call-|ed">called</reg> <lb/>
into play by the sight of youth and beauty in distress. <lb/>
This incident was not speedily forgotten. The emotions <lb/>
produced by it were new to him. He reviewed them <reg orig="often-|er">oftener</reg>, <lb/>
and with more complacency, than any which he had <lb/>
before experienced. They afforded him so much satisfaction, <lb/>
that, in order to preserve them undiminished, he resolved <lb/>
to repeat his visit. Constantia treated him as one from <lb/>
whom she had received a considerable benefit. Her <reg orig="sweet-|ness">sweetness</reg> <lb/>
and gentleness were uniform, and Balfour found that <lb/>
her humble roof promised him more happiness than his own <lb/>
fireside, or the society of his professional brethren.</p>
<p>He could not overlook, in the course of such reflections <lb/>
as these, the question relative to marriage, and speedily <reg orig="de-|termined">determined</reg> <lb/>
to solicit the honor of her hand. He had not <lb/>
decided without his usual foresight and deliberation; nor <lb/>
had he been wanting in the accuracy of his observations and <lb/>
inquiries. Those qualifications, indeed, which were of chief <lb/>
value in his eyes, lay upon the surface. He was no judge <lb/>
of her intellectual character, or of the loftiness of her <reg orig="morali-|ty">morality</reg>. <lb/>
Not even the graces of person, or features, or manners, <lb/>
attracted much of his attention. He remarked her <reg orig="admira-|ble">admirable</reg> <lb/>
economy of time, and money, and labor, the simplicity <lb/>
of her dress, her evenness of temper, and her love of <reg orig="seclu-|sion">seclusion</reg>. <lb/>
These were essential requisites of a wife in his <reg orig="ap-|prehension">apprehension</reg>. <lb/>
The insignificance of his own birth, the lowness <lb/>
of his original fortune, and the efficacy of industry and <reg orig="tem-|perance">temperance</reg> <lb/>
to confer and maintain wealth, had taught him <reg orig="in-|difference">indifference</reg> <lb/>
as to birth or fortune in his spouse. His <reg orig="mode-|rate">moderate</reg> <lb/>
desires in this respect were gratified, and he was <reg orig="anx-|ious">anxious</reg> <lb/>
only for a partner that would aid him in preserving, <lb/>
rather than in enlarging his property. He esteemed himself <lb/>
<pb n="73" entity="eaf033v5_0086" pid="uva-lib:350352"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">7</fw></pb>
eminently fortunate in meeting with one in whom every <reg orig="matri-|monial">matrimonial</reg> <lb/>
qualification concentred.</p>
<p>He was not deficient in modesty, but he fancied that, on <lb/>
this occasion, there was no possibility of miscarriage. He <lb/>
held her capacity in deep veneration, but this circumstance <lb/>
rendered him more secure of success. He conceived this <lb/>
union to be even more eligible with regard to her than to <lb/>
himself; and confided in the rectitude of her understanding, <lb/>
for a decision favorable to his wishes.</p>
<p>Before any express declaration was made, Constantia <lb/>
easily predicted the event from the frequency of his visits, and <lb/>
the attentiveness of his manners. It was no difficult task to <lb/>
ascertain this man's character. Her modes of thinking were, <lb/>
in few respects, similar to those of her lover. She was eager <lb/>
to investigate, in the first place, the attributes of his mind. <lb/>
His professional and household maxims were not of <reg orig="incon-|siderable">inconsiderable</reg> <lb/>
importance, but they were subordinate <reg orig="considera-|tions">considerations</reg>. <lb/>
In the poverty of his discourse and ideas, she quickly <lb/>
found reasons for determining her conduct.</p>
<p>Marriage she had but little considered, as it is in itself. <lb/>
What are the genuine principles of that relation, and what <lb/>
conduct with respect to it, is prescribed to rational beings, by <lb/>
their duty, she had not hitherto investigated. But she was <lb/>
not backward to inquire what are the precepts of duty, in <lb/>
her own particular case. She knew herself to be young; <lb/>
she was sensible of the daily enlargement of her knowledge; <lb/>
every day contributed to rectify some error or confirm some <lb/>
truth. These benefits she owed to her situation, which, <lb/>
whatever were its evils, gave her as much freedom from <reg orig="re-|straint">restraint</reg> <lb/>
as is consistent with the state of human affairs. Her <lb/>
poverty fettered her exertions, and circumscribed her <reg orig="plea-|sures">pleasures</reg>. <lb/>
Poverty, therefore, was an evil, and the reverse of <lb/>
poverty to be desired. But riches were not barren of <reg orig="con-|straint">constraint</reg>, <lb/>
and its advantages might be purchased at too dear a <lb/>
rate.</p>
<p>Allowing that the wife is enriched by marriage, how <reg orig="hu-|miliating">humiliating</reg> <lb/>
were the conditions annexed to it in the present <lb/>
case? The company of one with whom we have no <reg orig="sym-|pathy">sympathy</reg>, <lb/>
nor sentiments in common, is, of all species of <reg orig="soli-|tude">solitude</reg>, <lb/>
the most loathsome and dreary. The nuptial life is <lb/>
<pb n="74" entity="eaf033v5_0087" pid="uva-lib:350353"/>
attended with peculiar aggravations, since the tie is <reg orig="infrangi-|ble">infrangible</reg>, <lb/>
and the choice of a more suitable companion, if such a <lb/>
one should offer, is forever precluded. The hardships of <lb/>
wealth are not incompensated by some benefits, but these <lb/>
benefits, false and hollow as they are, cannot be obtained by <lb/>
marriage. Her acceptance of Balfour would merely <reg orig="aggra-|vate">aggravate</reg> <lb/>
her indigence.</p>
<p>Now she was at least mistress of the product of her own <lb/>
labor. Her tasks were toilsome, but the profits, though <lb/>
slender, were sure, and she administered her little property <lb/>
in what manner she pleased. Marriage would annihilate this <lb/>
power. Henceforth she would be bereft even of personal <lb/>
freedom. So far from possessing property, she herself would <lb/>
become the property of another.</p>
<p>She was not unaware of the consequences flowing from <lb/>
differences of capacity; and, that power, to whomsoever <reg orig="le-|gally">legally</reg> <lb/>
granted, will be exercised by the most addressful; but <lb/>
she derived no encouragement from these considerations. <lb/>
She would not stoop to gain her end by the hateful arts of <lb/>
the sycophant; and was too wise to place an unbounded <reg orig="re-|liance">reliance</reg> <lb/>
on the influence of truth. The character, likewise, of <lb/>
this man sufficiently exempted him from either of those <reg orig="in-|fluences">influences</reg>.</p>
<p>She did not forget the nature of the altar vows. To <reg orig="ab-|dicate">abdicate</reg> <lb/>
the use of her own understanding, was scarcely <reg orig="justifi-|able">justifiable</reg> <lb/>
in any case, but to vow an affection that was not felt, <lb/>
and could not be compelled, and to promise obedience to <lb/>
one, whose judgment was glaringly defective, were acts <reg orig="atro-|ciously">atrociously</reg> <lb/>
criminal. Education, besides, had created in her an <lb/>
insurmountable abhorrence of admitting to conjugal privileges, <lb/>
the man who had no claim upon her love. It could not be <lb/>
denied that a state of abundant accommodation was better <lb/>
than the contrary, but this consideration, though in the most <lb/>
rational estimate, of some weight, she was not so depraved <lb/>
and effeminate as to allow to overweigh the opposite evils. <lb/>
Homely liberty was better than splendid servitude.</p>
<p>Her resolution was easily formed, but there were certain <lb/>
impediments in the way of its execution. These chiefly <lb/>
arose from deference to the opinion, and compassion for the <lb/>
infirmities of her father. He assumed no control over her <lb/>
actions. His reflections in the present case, were rather <lb/>
<pb n="75" entity="eaf033v5_0088" pid="uva-lib:350354"/>
understood than expressed. When uttered it was with the <lb/>
mildness of equality, and the modesty of persuasion. It was <lb/>
this circumstance that conferred upon them all their force. <lb/>
His decision, on so delicate a topic, was not wanting in <reg orig="sa-|gacity">sagacity</reg> <lb/>
and moderation; but, as a man, he had his portion of <lb/>
defects, and his frame was enfeebled by disease and care; <lb/>
yet he set no higher value on the ease and independence of <lb/>
his former condition, than any man of like experience. <lb/>
He could not endure to exist on the fruits of his daughter's <lb/>
labor. He ascribed her decision to a spirit of excessive <reg orig="re-|finement">refinement</reg>, <lb/>
and was, of course, disposed to give little quarter <lb/>
to maiden scruples. They were phantoms, he believed, <lb/>
which experience would dispel. His morality, besides, was <lb/>
of a much more flexible kind; and the marriage vows were, <lb/>
in his opinion, formal and unmeaning, and neither in <reg orig="them-|selves">themselves</reg>, <lb/>
nor in the apprehension of the world, accompanied <lb/>
with any rigorous obligation. He drew more favorable omens <lb/>
from the known capacity of his daughter, and the flexibility <lb/>
of her lover.</p>
<p>She demanded his opinion and advice. She listened to <lb/>
his reasonings, and revolved them with candor and <reg orig="impartial-|ity">impartiality</reg>. <lb/>
She stated her objections with simplicity, but the <reg orig="dif-|ference">difference</reg> <lb/>
of age and sex was sufficient to preclude agreement. <lb/>
Arguments were of no use but to prolong the debate; but, <lb/>
happily, the magnanimity of Mr. Dudley would admit of no <lb/>
sacrifice. Her opinions, it is true, were erroneous; but he <lb/>
was willing that she should regulate her conduct by her own <lb/>
conceptions of right, and not by those of another. To <reg orig="re-|fuse">refuse</reg> <lb/>
Balfour's offers was an evil, but an evil inexpressibly <lb/>
exceeded by that of accepting them contrary to her own <lb/>
sense of propriety.</p>
<p>Difficulties, likewise, arose from the consideration of what <lb/>
was due to the man who had already benefited her, and <lb/>
who, in this act, intended to confer upon her further benefit. <lb/>
These, though the source of some embarrassments, were not <lb/>
sufficient to shake her resolution. Balfour could not <reg orig="under-|stand">understand</reg> <lb/>
her principal objections. They were of a size <reg orig="alto-|gether">altogether</reg> <lb/>
disproportioned to his capacity. Her moral <reg orig="specula-|tions">speculations</reg> <lb/>
were quite beyond the sphere of his reflections. She <lb/>
could not expatiate, without a breach of civility, on the <reg orig="dis-|parity">disparity</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="76" entity="eaf033v5_0089" pid="uva-lib:350355"/>
of their minds, and yet this was the only or principal <lb/>
ground on which she had erected her scruples.</p>
<p>Her father loved her too well not to be desirous of <reg orig="reliev-|ing">relieving</reg> <lb/>
her from a painful task, though undertaken without <reg orig="ne-|cessity">necessity</reg>, <lb/>
and contrary to his opinion. Refer him to me, <lb/>
said he; I will make the best of the matter, and render your <lb/>
refusal as palatable as possible, but do you authorize me to <lb/>
make it absolute, and without appeal?&mdash;</p>
<p>My dear father! how good you are! but that shall be <lb/>
my province. If I err, let the consequences of my mistake <lb/>
be confined to myself. It would be cruel indeed, to make <lb/>
you the instrument in a transaction which your judgment <reg orig="dis-|approves">disapproves</reg>. <lb/>
My reluctance was a weak and foolish thing. <lb/>
Strange, indeed, if the purity of my motives will not bear me <lb/>
out on this, as it has done on many more arduous occasions.</p>
<p>Well, be it so; that is best I believe. Ten to one but I, <lb/>
with my want of eyes, would blunder, while yours will be of <lb/>
no small use, in a contest with a lover. They will serve you <lb/>
to watch the transitions in his placid physiognomy, and <reg orig="over-|power">overpower</reg> <lb/>
his discontents.</p>
<p>She was aware of the inconveniences to which this <reg orig="reso-|lution">resolution</reg> <lb/>
would subject her, but since they were unavoidable, <lb/>
she armed herself with the requisite patience. Her <reg orig="appre-|hensions">apprehensions</reg> <lb/>
were not without reason. More than one <reg orig="confer-|ence">conference</reg> <lb/>
was necessary to convince him of her meaning, and in <lb/>
order to effect her purpose, she was obliged to behave with <lb/>
so much explicitness, as to hazard giving him offence. This <lb/>
affair was productive of no small vexation. He had put too <lb/>
much faith in the validity of his pretensions, and the benefits <lb/>
of perseverance, to be easily shaken off.</p>
<p>This decision was not borne by him with as much patience <lb/>
as she wished. He deemed himself unjustly treated, and <lb/>
his resentment exceeded those bounds of moderation which <lb/>
he prescribed to himself on all other occasions. From his <lb/>
anger, however, there was not much to be dreaded, but, <reg orig="un-|fortunately">unfortunately</reg>, <lb/>
his sister partook of his indignation and indulged <lb/>
her petulance, which was enforced by every gossiping and <lb/>
tatling propensity, to the irreparable disadvantage of <reg orig="Con-|stantia">Constantia</reg>.</p>
<p>She owed her support to her needle. She was <reg orig="depen-|dent">dependent</reg> <lb/>
therefore on the caprice of customers. This caprice <lb/>
<pb n="77" entity="eaf033v5_0090" pid="uva-lib:350356"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">7*</fw></pb>
was swayable by every breath, and paid a merely <reg orig="subordi-|nate">subordinate</reg> <lb/>
regard, in the choice of workwomen, to the <reg orig="circum-|stances">circumstances</reg> <lb/>
of skill, cheapness and diligence. In consequence <lb/>
of this, her usual sources of subsistence began to fail.</p>
<p>Indigence, as well as wealth, is comparative. He, indeed, <lb/>
must be wretched, whose food, clothing and shelter are <reg orig="limit-|ed">limited</reg>, <lb/>
both in kind and quantity, by the standard of mere <reg orig="ne-|cessity">necessity</reg>; <lb/>
who, in the choice of food, for example, is governed <lb/>
by no consideration but its cheapness, and its capacity to <lb/>
sustain nature. Yet to this degree of wretchedness was Miss <lb/>
Dudley reduced.</p>
<p>As her means of subsistence began to decay, she reflected <lb/>
on the change of employment that might become necessary. <lb/>
She was mistress of no lucrative art, but that which now <lb/>
threatened to be useless. There was but one avenue <lb/>
through which she could hope to escape from the pressure <lb/>
of absolute want. This, she regarded with an aversion, <lb/>
that nothing but extreme necessity, and the failure of every <lb/>
other expedient, would be able to subdue. This was the <lb/>
hiring herself as a servant. Even that could not answer all <lb/>
her purposes. If a subsistence were provided by it for <lb/>
herself, whither should her father, and her Lucy betake <lb/>
themselves for support.</p>
<p>Hitherto her labor had been sufficient to shut out famine <lb/>
and the cold. It is true she had been cut off from all the <lb/>
direct means of personal or mental gratification; but her <lb/>
constitution had exempted her from the insalutary effects of <lb/>
sedentary application. She could not tell how long she <lb/>
could enjoy this exemption, but it was absurd to anticipate <lb/>
those evils which might never arrive. Meanwhile, her <reg orig="situa-|tion">situation</reg> <lb/>
was not destitute of comfort. The indirect means of <lb/>
intellectual improvement, in conversation and reflection, the <lb/>
inexpensive amusement of singing, and, above all, the <reg orig="con-|sciousness">consciousness</reg> <lb/>
of performing her duty, and maintaining her <reg orig="in-|dependence">independence</reg> <lb/>
inviolate, were still in her possession. Her <lb/>
lodging was humble, and her fare frugal, but these, <reg orig="temper-|ance">temperance</reg> <lb/>
and a due regard to the use of money, would require <lb/>
from the most opulent.</p>
<p>Now, retrenchments must be made even from this <reg orig="penu-|rious">penurious</reg> <lb/>
provision. Her exertions might somewhat defer, but <lb/>
<pb n="78" entity="eaf033v5_0091" pid="uva-lib:350357"/>
could not prevent the ruin of her unhappy family. Their <lb/>
landlord was a severe exacter of his dues. The day of <lb/>
quarterly payment was past, and he had not failed in his <lb/>
usual punctuality. She was unable to satisfy his demands, <lb/>
and Mr. Dudley was officially informed, that unless payment <lb/>
was made before a day fixed, resort would be had to the <lb/>
law, in that case made and provided.</p>
<p>This seemed to be the completion of their misfortunes. <lb/>
It was not enough to soften the implacability of their <reg orig="land-|lord">landlord</reg>. <lb/>
A respite might possibly be obtained from this harsh <lb/>
sentence. Intreaties might prevail upon him to allow of <lb/>
their remaining under this roof for some time longer; but <lb/>
shelter at this inclement season was not enough. Without <lb/>
fire they must perish with the cold; and fuel could be <reg orig="pro-|cured">procured</reg> <lb/>
only for money, of which the last shilling was <reg orig="expend-|ed">expended</reg>. <lb/>
Food was no less indispensable, and, their credit being <lb/>
gone, not a loaf could be extorted from the avarice of the <lb/>
bakers in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>The sensations produced by this accumulation of distress <lb/>
may be more easily conceived than described. Mr. <reg orig="Dud-|ley">Dudley</reg> <lb/>
sunk into despair, when Lucy informed him that the <lb/>
billet of wood she was putting on the fire was the last. <lb/>
Well, said he, the game is up. Where is my daughter?&mdash; <lb/>
The answer was that she was up stairs.</p>
<p>Why, there she has been this hour. Tell her to come <lb/>
down and warm herself. She must needs be cold and here <lb/>
is a cheerful blaze. I feel it myself. Like the lightning <lb/>
that precedes death, it beams thus brightly, though, in a few <lb/>
moments, it will be extinguished forever. Let my darling <lb/>
come, and partake of its comforts before they expire.</p>
<p>Constantia had retired in order to review her situation, <lb/>
and devise some expedients that might alleviate it. It was <lb/>
a sore extremity to which she was reduced. Things had <lb/>
come to a desperate pass, and the remedy required must <lb/>
be no less desperate. It was impossible to see her father <lb/>
perish. She herself would have died before she would <lb/>
have condescended to beg. It was not worth prolonging a <lb/>
life which must subsist upon alms. She would have <reg orig="wan-|dered">wandered</reg> <lb/>
into the fields at dusk, have seated herself upon an <lb/>
unfrequented bank, and serenely waited the approach of <lb/>
that death, which the rigors of the season would have <lb/>
<pb n="79" entity="eaf033v5_0092" pid="uva-lib:350358"/>
rendered sure. But, as it was, it became her to act in a <lb/>
very different manner.</p>
<p>During her father's prosperity, some mercantile <reg orig="inter-|course">intercourse</reg> <lb/>
had taken place between him and a merchant of this <lb/>
city. The latter, on some occasion, had spent a few nights <lb/>
at her father's house. She was greatly charmed with the <lb/>
humanity that shone forth in his conversation and behavior. <lb/>
From that time to this, all intercourse had ceased. She was <lb/>
acquainted with the place of his abode, and knew him to be <lb/>
affluent. To him she determined to apply as a suppliant in <lb/>
behalf of her father. She did not inform Mr. Dudley of <lb/>
this intention, conceiving it best to wait till the event had <lb/>
been ascertained, for fear of exciting fallacious expectations. <lb/>
She was further deterred by the apprehension of awakening <lb/>
his pride, and bringing on herself an absolute prohibition.</p>
<p>She arrived at the door of Mr. Melbourne's house, and <lb/>
inquiring for the master of it, was informed that he had <lb/>
gone out of town, and was not expected to return within a <lb/>
week.</p>
<p>Her scheme, which was by no means unplausible, was <lb/>
thus completely frustrated. There was but one other <reg orig="re-|source">resource</reg>, <lb/>
on which she had already deliberated, and to which <lb/>
she had determined to apply, if that should fail. That was <lb/>
to claim assistance from the superintendents of the poor. <lb/>
She was employed in considering to which of them, and in <lb/>
what manner she should make her application, when she <lb/>
turned the corner of Lombard and Second streets. That <lb/>
had scarcely been done, when, casting her eyes mournfully <lb/>
round her, she caught a glimpse of a person whom she <reg orig="in-|stantly">instantly</reg> <lb/>
recognised, passing into the market place. She <lb/>
followed him with quick steps, and, on a second examination, <lb/>
found that she had not been mistaken. This was no other <lb/>
than Thomas Craig, to whose malignity and cunning, all her <lb/>
misfortunes were imputable.</p>
<p>She was at first uncertain what use to make of this <reg orig="dis-|covery">discovery</reg>. <lb/>
She followed him almost instinctively, and saw him <lb/>
at length enter the Indian Queen Tavern. Here she <reg orig="stop-|ped">stopped</reg>. <lb/>
She entertained a confused conception, that some <lb/>
beneficial consequences might be extracted from this event. <lb/>
In the present hurry of her thoughts she could form no <reg orig="satis-|factory">satisfactory</reg> <lb/>
conclusion; but it instantly occurred to her that it <lb/>
<pb n="80" entity="eaf033v5_0093" pid="uva-lib:350359"/>
would, at least be proper to ascertain the place of his abode. <lb/>
She stept into the inn, and made the suitable inquiries. She <lb/>
was informed that the gentleman had come from Baltimore, <lb/>
a month before, and had since resided at that house. How <lb/>
soon he meant to leave the city, her informant was unable <lb/>
to tell.</p>
<p>Having gained this intelligence, she returned home, and <lb/>
once more shut herself in her chamber to meditate on this <lb/>
new posture of affairs.</p>
<ornament type="line"/>
</div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="X" id="d17">
<head>CHAPTER X.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Craig</hi> was indebted to her father. He had defrauded <lb/>
him by the most atrocious and illicit arts. On either <lb/>
account he was liable to prosecution, but her heart rejected <lb/>
the thought of being the author of injury to any man. The <lb/>
dread of punishment, however, might induce him to refund, <lb/>
uncoercively, the whole or some part of the stolen property. <lb/>
Money was at this moment necessary to existence, and she <lb/>
conceived herself justly entitled to that, of which her father <lb/>
had been perfidiously despoiled.</p>
<p>But the law was formal and circuitous. Money itself <lb/>
was necessary to purchase its assistance. Besides, it could <lb/>
not act with unseen virtue and instantaneous celerity. The <lb/>
co-operation of advocates and officers was required. They <lb/>
must be visited, and harangued, and importuned. Was she <lb/>
adequate to the task? Would the energy of her mind <lb/>
supply the place of experience, and, with a sort of <reg orig="miracu-|lous">miraculous</reg> <lb/>
efficacy, afford her the knowledge of official processes <lb/>
and dues? As little, on this occasion, could be expected <lb/>
from her father, as from her. He was infirm and blind. <lb/>
The spirit that animated his former days was flown. His <lb/>
heart's blood was chilled by the rigors of his fortune. He <lb/>
had discarded his indignation and his enmities, and, together <lb/>
with them, hope itself had perished in his bosom. He <lb/>
waited in tranquil despair, for that stroke which would deliver <lb/>
him from life, and all the woes that it inherits.</p>
<p>But these considerations were superfluous. It was enough <lb/>
<pb n="81" entity="eaf033v5_0094" pid="uva-lib:350360"/>
that justice must be bought, and that she had not the <reg orig="equiva-|lent">equivalent</reg>. <lb/>
Legal proceedings are encumbered with delay, and <lb/>
her necessities were urgent. Succor, if withheld till the <lb/>
morrow, would be useless. Hunger and cold would not be <lb/>
trifled with. What resource was there left in this her <reg orig="utter-|most">uttermost</reg> <lb/>
distress? Must she yield, in imitation of her father, <lb/>
to the cowardly suggestions of despair?</p>
<p>Craig might be rich. His coffers might be stuffed with <lb/>
thousands. All that he had, according to the principles of <lb/>
social equity, was hers; yet he, to whom nothing belonged, <lb/>
rioted in superfluity, while she, the rightful claimant, was <lb/>
driven to the point of utmost need. The proper instrument <lb/>
of her restoration was law, but its arm was powerless, for <lb/>
she had not the means of bribing it into activity. But was <lb/>
law the only instrument?</p>
<p>Craig, perhaps, was accessible. Might she not, with <lb/>
propriety, demand an interview, and lay before him the <reg orig="con-|sequences">consequences</reg> <lb/>
of his baseness? He was not divested of the <lb/>
last remains of humanity. It was impossible that he should <lb/>
not relent at the picture of those distresses of which he was <lb/>
the author. Menaces of legal prosecution she meant not <lb/>
to use, because she was unalterably resolved against that <lb/>
remedy. She confided in the efficacy of her pleadings to <lb/>
awaken his justice. This interview she was determined <reg orig="im-|mediately">immediately</reg> <lb/>
to seek. She was aware that by some accident <lb/>
her purpose might be frustrated. Access to his person, <lb/>
might, for the present, be impossible, or might be denied. <lb/>
It was proper therefore to write him a letter, which might be <lb/>
substituted in place of an interview. It behoved her to be <lb/>
expeditious, for the light was failing, and her strength was <lb/>
nearly exhausted by the hurry of her spirits. Her fingers, <lb/>
likewise, were benumbed with the cold. She performed <lb/>
her task, under these disadvantages, with much difficulty. <lb/>
This was the purport of her letter.</p>
<q><text><body><div1 type="letter" id="d18">

<salute><hi rend="italic">Thomas Craig,</hi></salute>
</opener>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">An</hi> hour ago I was in Second street, and <lb/>
saw you. I followed you till you entered the Indian Queen <lb/>
Tavern. Knowing where you are, I am now preparing to <lb/>
demand an interview. I may be disappointed in this hope, <lb/>
and therefore write you this.</p>
<pb n="82" entity="eaf033v5_0095" pid="uva-lib:350361"/>
<p>I do not come to upbraid you, to call you to a legal, or <lb/>
any other account for your actions. I presume not to weigh <lb/>
your merits. The God of equity he your judge. May he <lb/>
be as merciful, in the hour of retribution, as I am disposed <lb/>
to be.</p>
<p>It is only to inform you that my father is on the point of <lb/>
perishing with want. You know who it was that reduced <lb/>
him to this condition. I persuade myself I shall not appeal <lb/>
to your justice in vain. Learn of this justice to afford him <lb/>
instant succor.</p>
<p>You know who it was that took you in, a houseless <lb/>
wanderer; protected and fostered your youth, and shared <lb/>
with you his confidence and his fortune. It is he who now, <lb/>
blind and indigent, is threatened, by an inexorable landlord, <lb/>
to be thrust into the street; and who is, at this moment, <lb/>
without fire and without bread.</p>
<p>He once did you some little service; now he looks to be <lb/>
compensated. All the retribution he asks, is to be saved <lb/>
from perishing. Surely you will not spurn at his claims. <lb/>
Thomas Craig has done nothing that shews him deaf to <lb/>
the cries of distress. He would relieve a dog from such <lb/>
suffering.</p>
<p>Forget that you have known my father in any character <lb/>
but that of a supplicant for bread. I promise you that, on <lb/>
this condition, I, also, will forget it. If you are so far just, <lb/>
you have nothing to fear. Your property and reputation <lb/>
shall both be safe. My father knows not of your being in <lb/>
this city. His enmities are extinct, and if you comply with <lb/>
this request, he shall know you only as a benefactor.</p>

<p>Having finished and folded this epistle, she once more <lb/>
returned to the tavern. A waiter informed her that Craig <lb/>
had lately been in, and was now gone out to spend the <lb/>
evening. Whither had he gone? she asked.</p>
<p>How was he to know where gentlemen eat their suppers? <lb/>
Did she take him for a witch? What, in God's name, did <lb/>
she want with him at that hour? Could she not wait, at <lb/>
least, till he had done his supper? He warranted her <reg orig="pret-|ty">pretty</reg> <lb/>
face would bring him home time enough.</p>
<p>Constantia was not disconcerted at this address. She <lb/>
<pb n="83" entity="eaf033v5_0096" pid="uva-lib:350362"/>
knew that females are subjected, through their own ignorance <lb/>
and cowardice, to a thousand mortifications. She set its <lb/>
true value on base and low minded treatment. She <reg orig="dis-|dained">disdained</reg> <lb/>
to notice this ribaldry, but turned away from the <lb/>
servant to meditate on this disappointment.</p>
<p>A few moments after, a young fellow smartly dressed, <lb/>
entered the apartment. He was immediately addressed by <lb/>
the other, who said to him, Well, Tom, where's your master. <lb/>
There's a lady wants him, pointing to Constantia, and <reg orig="lay-|ing">laying</reg> <lb/>
a grinning emphasis on the word lady. She turned to <lb/>
the new comer: Friend, are you Mr. Craig's servant?</p>
<p>The fellow seemed somewhat irritated at the bluntness of <lb/>
her interrogatory. The appellation of servant sat uneasily, <lb/>
perhaps, on his pride, especially as coming from a person of <lb/>
her appearance. He put on an air of familiar ridicule, and <lb/>
surveyed her in silence. She resumed, in an authoritative <lb/>
tone, where does Mr. Craig spend this evening? I have <reg orig="bu-|siness">business</reg> <lb/>
with him of the highest importance, and that will not <lb/>
bear delay. I must see him this night.&mdash;He seemed <reg orig="pre-|paring">preparing</reg> <lb/>
to make some impertinent answer, but she anticipated <lb/>
it. You had better answer me with decency. If you do <lb/>
not, your master shall hear of it.</p>
<p>This menace was not ineffectual. He began to perceive <lb/>
himself in the wrong, and surlily muttered, Why, if you must <lb/>
know, he is gone to Mr. Ormond's. And where lived Mr. <lb/>
Ormond? In Arch Street; he mentioned the number on <lb/>
her questioning him to that effect.</p>
<p>Being furnished with this information, she left them. Her <lb/>
project was not to be thwarted by slight impediments, and <lb/>
she forthwith proceeded to Ormond's dwelling. Who was <lb/>
this Ormond? she inquired of herself as she went along; <lb/>
whence originated, and of what nature is the connexion <reg orig="be-|tween">between</reg> <lb/>
him and Craig? Are they united by union of <reg orig="de-|signs">designs</reg> <lb/>
and sympathy of character, or is this stranger a new <lb/>
subject on whom Craig is practising his arts? The last <reg orig="sup-|position">supposition</reg> <lb/>
is not impossible. Is it not my duty to disconcert <lb/>
his machinations, and save a new victim from his treachery? <lb/>
But I ought to be sure before I act. He may now be <reg orig="hon-|est">honest</reg>, <lb/>
or tending to honesty, and my inteference may cast him <lb/>
backward, or impede his progress.</p>
<p>The house to which she had been directed was spacious <lb/>
<pb n="84" entity="eaf033v5_0097" pid="uva-lib:350363"/>
and magnificent. She was answered by a servant, whose <lb/>
uniform was extremely singular and fanciful, and whose <reg orig="fea-|tures">features</reg> <lb/>
and accents bespoke him to be English, with a <reg orig="polite-|ness">politeness</reg> <lb/>
to which she knew that the simplicity of her garb gave <lb/>
her no title. Craig, he told her, was in the drawing room <lb/>
above stairs. He offered to carry him any message, and <lb/>
ushured her, meanwhile, into a parlor. She was surprised <lb/>
at the splendor of the room. The ceiling was painted with <lb/>
a gay design, the walls stuccoed in relief, and the floor <reg orig="cov-|ered">covered</reg> <lb/>
with a Persian carpet, with suitable accompaniments of <lb/>
mirrors, tables and sofas.</p>
<p>Craig had been seated at the window above. His <reg orig="suspi-|cions">suspicions</reg> <lb/>
were ever on the watch. He suddenly espied a figure <lb/>
and face on the opposite side of the street, which an <reg orig="altera-|tion">alteration</reg> <lb/>
of garb and the improvements of time, could not conceal <lb/>
from his knowledge. He was startled at this incident, <reg orig="with-|out">without</reg> <lb/>
knowing the extent of its consequences. He saw her <lb/>
cross the way opposite this house, and immediately after <lb/>
heard the bell ring. Still he was not aware that he himself <lb/>
was the object of this visit, and waited, with some degree of <lb/>
impatience, for the issue of this adventure.</p>
<p>Presently he was summoned to a person below, who <reg orig="wish-|ed">wished</reg> <lb/>
to see him. The servant shut the door, as soon as he <lb/>
had delivered the message, and retired.</p>
<p>Craig was thrown into considerable perplexity. It was <lb/>
seldom that he was wanting in presence of mind and <reg orig="dexter-|ity">dexterity</reg>, <lb/>
but the unexpectedness of this incident, made him pause. <lb/>
He had not forgotten the awful charms of his summoner. He <lb/>
shrunk at the imagination of her rebukes. What purpose <lb/>
could be answered by admitting her? It was, undoubtedly, <lb/>
safest to keep at a distance, but what excuse should be given <lb/>
for refusing this interview? He was roused from his reverie <lb/>
by a second and more urgent summons. The person could <lb/>
not conveniently wait; her business was of the utmost <reg orig="mo-|ment">moment</reg>, <lb/>
and would detain him but a few minutes.</p>
<p>The anxiety which was thus expressed to see him, only <lb/>
augmented his solicitude to remain invisible. He had <reg orig="pa-|pers">papers</reg> <lb/>
before him which he had been employed in examining. <lb/>
This suggested an excuse. Tell her that I am engaged just <lb/>
now, and cannot possibly attend to her. Let her leave her <lb/>
business. If she has any message you may bring it to me.</p>
<pb n="85" entity="eaf033v5_0098" pid="uva-lib:350364"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">8</fw></pb>
<p>It was plain to Constantia that Craig suspected the <reg orig="pur-|pose">purpose</reg> <lb/>
of her visit. This might have come to his knowledge <lb/>
by means impossible for her to divine. She now perceived <lb/>
the wisdom of the precaution she had taken. She gave her <lb/>
letter to the servant with this message; Tell him I shall wait <lb/>
here for an answer, and continue to wait till I receive one.</p>
<p>Her mind was powerfully affected by the criticalness of <lb/>
her situation. She had gone thus far, and saw the necessity <lb/>
of persisting to the end. The goal was within view, and she <lb/>
formed a sort of desperate determination not to relinquish <lb/>
the pursuit. She could not overlook the possibility that he <lb/>
might return no answer, or return an unsatisfactory one. In <lb/>
either case, she was resolved to remain in the house till driven <lb/>
from it by violence. What other resolution could she form? <lb/>
To return to her desolate home, penniless, was an idea not <lb/>
to be endured.</p>
<p>The letter was received, and perused. His conscience <lb/>
was touched, but compunction was a guest, whose <reg orig="importu-|nities">importunities</reg> <lb/>
he had acquired a peculiar facility of eluding. Here <lb/>
was a liberal offer. A price was set upon his impunity. A <lb/>
small sum, perhaps, would secure him from all future <reg orig="moles-|tation.&mdash;She">molestation.&mdash;She</reg> <lb/>
spoke, to be sure, in a damned high tone. <lb/>
'Twas a pity that the old man should be hungry before <reg orig="sup-|per">supper</reg> <lb/>
time. Blind too! Harder still, when he cannot find his <lb/>
way to his mouth. Rent unpaid, and a flinty-hearted <reg orig="land-|lord">landlord</reg>. <lb/>
A pretty pickle to be sure. Instant payment she says. <lb/>
Won't part without it. Must come down with the stuff. I <lb/>
know this girl. When her heart is once set upon a thing, all <lb/>
the devils will not turn her out of her way. She promises <lb/>
silence. I can't pretend to bargain with her. I 'd as lief be <lb/>
ducked, as meet her face to face. I know she 'll do what <lb/>
she promises. That was always her grand failing. How <lb/>
the little witch talks! Just the dreamer she ever was! <reg orig="Jus-|tice">Justice</reg>! <lb/>
Compassion! Stupid fool! One would think she 'd <lb/>
learned something of the world by this time.</p>
<p>He took out his pocket book. Among the notes it <reg orig="con-|tained">contained</reg> <lb/>
the lowest was fifty dollars. This was too much, yet <lb/>
there was no alternative, something must be given. She <lb/>
had detected his abode, and he knew it was in the power of <lb/>
the Dudleys to ruin his reputation, and obstruct his present <lb/>
<pb n="86" entity="eaf033v5_0099" pid="uva-lib:350365"/>
schemes. It was probable, that if they should exert <reg orig="them-|selves">themselves</reg>, <lb/>
their cause would find advocates and patrons. Still <lb/>
the gratuitous gift of fifty dollars, sat uneasily upon his <reg orig="ava-|rice">avarice</reg>. <lb/>
One idea occurred to reconcile him to the gift. There <lb/>
was a method he conceived of procuring the repayment of it <lb/>
with interest. He inclosed the note in a blank piece of <reg orig="pa-|per">paper</reg> <lb/>
and sent it to her.</p>
<p>She received the paper, and opened it with trembling <reg orig="fin-|gers">fingers</reg>. <lb/>
When she saw what were its contents, her feelings <lb/>
amounted to rapture. A sum like this was affluence to her in <lb/>
her present condition. At least it would purchase present <lb/>
comfort and security. Her heart glowed with exultation, and <lb/>
she seemed to tread with the lightness of air, as she hied <lb/>
homeward. The langour of a long fast, the numbness of the <lb/>
cold, were forgotten. It is worthy of remark how much of <lb/>
human accommodation was comprised within this small <reg orig="com-|pass">compass</reg>; <lb/>
and how sudden was this transition from the verge of <lb/>
destruction to the summit of security.</p>
<p>Her first business was to call upon her landlord and pay <lb/>
him his demand. On her return she discharged the little <lb/>
debts she had been obliged to contract, and purchased what <lb/>
was immediately necessary. Wood she could borrow from <lb/>
her next neighbor, and this she was willing to do, now that <lb/>
she had the prospect of repaying it.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">On</hi> leaving Mr. Ormond's house, Constantia was met by <lb/>
that gentleman. He saw her as she came out, and was <lb/>
charmed with the simplicity of her appearance. On entering <lb/>
he interrogated the servant as to the business that brought her <lb/>
thither.</p>
<p>So, said he, as he entered the drawing-room, where Craig <lb/>
was seated, you have had a visitant. She came, it seems, <lb/>
on a pressing occasion, and would be put off with nothing <lb/>
but a letter.</p>
<p>Craig had not expected this address, but it only <reg orig="precipi-|tated">precipitated</reg> <lb/>
the execution of a design that he had formed. Being <lb/>
aware of this or similar accidents, he had constructed and <lb/>
<pb n="87" entity="eaf033v5_0100" pid="uva-lib:350366"/>
related on a previous occasion to Ormond, a story suitable <lb/>
to his purpose.</p>
<p>Aye, said he, in a tone of affected compassion, it is a sad <lb/>
affair enough. I am sorry 'tis not in my power to help the <lb/>
poor girl. She is wrong in imputing her father's misfortunes <lb/>
to me, but I know the source of her mistake. Would to <lb/>
heaven it was in my power to repair the wrongs they have <lb/>
suffered, not from me, but from one whose relationship is a <lb/>
disgrace to me.</p>
<p>Perhaps, replied the other, you are willing to explain this <lb/>
affair.</p>
<p>Yes, I wish to explain it. I was afraid of some such <reg orig="ac-|cident">accident</reg> <lb/>
as this. An explanation is due to my character. I <lb/>
have already told you my story. I mentioned to you a <reg orig="bro-|ther">brother</reg> <lb/>
of mine. There is scarcely thirteen months difference in <lb/>
our ages. There is a strong resemblance between him and <lb/>
me, in our exterior, though I hope there is none at all in our <lb/>
minds. This brother was a partner of a gentleman, the <reg orig="fa-|ther">father</reg> <lb/>
of this girl, at New York. He was, a long time, nothing <lb/>
better than an apprentice to Mr. Dudley, but he advanced <lb/>
so much in the good graces of his master, that he finally took <lb/>
him into partnership. I did not know till I arrived on the <lb/>
continent, the whole of his misconduct. It appears that he <lb/>
embezzled the property of the house, and fled away with it, <lb/>
and the consequence was, that his quondam master was <lb/>
ruined. I am often mistaken for my brother, to my no small <lb/>
inconvenience; but all this I told you formerly. See what <lb/>
a letter I just now received from this girl.</p>
<p>Craig was one of the most plausible of men. His <reg orig="char-|acter">character</reg> <lb/>
was a standing proof of the vanity of physiognomy. <lb/>
There were few men who could refuse their confidence to <lb/>
his open and ingenuous aspect. To this circumstance, <reg orig="per-|haps">perhaps</reg>, <lb/>
he owed his ruin. His temptations to deceive were <lb/>
stronger than what are incident to most other men. <reg orig="Decep-|tion">Deception</reg> <lb/>
was so easy a task, that the difficulty lay, not in infusing <lb/>
false opinions respecting him, but in preventing them from <lb/>
being spontaneously imbibed. He contracted habits of <reg orig="im-|posture">imposture</reg> <lb/>
imperceptibly. In proportion as he deviated from <lb/>
the practice of truth, he discerned the necessity of extending <lb/>
and systematizing his efforts, and of augmenting the original <lb/>
henignity and attractiveness of his looks, by studied additions. <lb/>
<pb n="88" entity="eaf033v5_0101" pid="uva-lib:350367"/>
The further he proceeded, the more difficult it was to return. <lb/>
Experience and habit added daily to his speciousness, till at <lb/>
length, the world perhaps might have been searched in vain <lb/>
for his competitor.</p>
<p>He had been introduced to Ormond under the most <reg orig="favor-|able">favorable</reg> <lb/>
auspices. He had provided against a danger which he <lb/>
knew to be imminent, by relating his own story as if it were <lb/>
his brother's. He had, however, made various additions to <lb/>
it, serving to aggravate the heinousness of his guilt. This <lb/>
arose partly from policy, and partly from the habit of lying, <lb/>
which was prompted by a fertile invention, and rendered <reg orig="in-|veterate">inveterate</reg> <lb/>
by incessant exercise. He interwove in his tale, an <lb/>
intrigue between Miss Dudley and his brother. The former <lb/>
was seduced, and this man had employed his skill in <reg orig="chiro-|graphical">chirographical</reg> <lb/>
imitation, in composing letters from Miss Dudley <lb/>
to his brother, which sufficiently attested her dishonor. He <lb/>
and his brother, he related, to have met in Jamaica, where <lb/>
the latter died, by which means his personal property and <lb/>
papers came into his possession.</p>
<p>Ormond read the letter which his companion presented to <lb/>
him on this occasion. The papers which Craig had formerly <lb/>
permitted him to inspect, had made him familiar with her <lb/>
handwriting. The penmanship was, indeed, similar, yet <lb/>
this was written in a spirit not quite congenial with that which <lb/>
had dictated her letters to her lover. But he reflected that <lb/>
the emergency was extraordinary, and that the new scenes <lb/>
through which she had passed, had, perhaps, enabled her to <lb/>
retrieve her virtue and enforce it. The picture which she <lb/>
drew of her father's distresses, affected him and his <reg orig="compan-|ion">companion</reg> <lb/>
very differently. He pondered on it for some time, in <lb/>
silence; he then looked up, and with his usual abruptness <lb/>
said, I suppose you gave her something?</p>
<p>No. I was extremely sorry that it was not in my power.</p>
<p>I have nothing but a little trifling silver about me. I have <lb/>
no more at home than will barely suffice to pay my board <lb/>
here, and my expenses to Baltimore. Till I reach there I <lb/>
cannot expect a supply. I was less uneasy, I confess, on <lb/>
this account, because I knew you to be equally willing and <lb/>
much more able to afford the relief she asks.</p>
<p>This, Mr. Ormond had predetermined to do. He paused <lb/>
only to deliberate in what manner it could, with most <reg orig="pro-|priety">propriety</reg>, <lb/>
<pb n="89" entity="eaf033v5_0102" pid="uva-lib:350368"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">8*</fw></pb>
be done. He was always willing, when he conferred <lb/>
benefits, to conceal the author. He was not displeased <lb/>
when gratitude was misplaced, and readily allowed his <reg orig="in-|struments">instruments</reg> <lb/>
to act as if they were principals. He questioned <lb/>
not the veracity of Craig, and was, therefore, desirous to free <lb/>
him from the molestation that was threatened in the way <lb/>
which had been prescribed. He put a note of one hundred <lb/>
dollars into his hand, and enjoined him to send it to the <reg orig="Dud-|leys">Dudleys</reg> <lb/>
that evening, or early the next morning. I am pleased, <lb/>
he added, with the style of this letter; it can be of no <reg orig="ser-|vice">service</reg> <lb/>
to you; leave it in my possession.</p>
<p>Craig would much rather have thrown it into the fire; <lb/>
but he knew the character of his companion, and was afraid <lb/>
to make any objection to his request. He promised to send, <lb/>
or carry the note, the next morning, before he set out on his <lb/>
intended journey.</p>
<p>This journey was to Baltimore, and was undertaken so <lb/>
soon merely to oblige his friend, who was desirous of <lb/>
remitting to Baltimore a considerable sum in English guineas, <lb/>
and who had been for some time in search of one who <lb/>
might execute this commission with fidelity. The offer of <lb/>
Craig had been joyfully accepted, and next morning had <lb/>
been the time fixed for his departure, a period the most <lb/>
opportune for Craig's designs, that could be imagined.&mdash;To <lb/>
return to Miss Dudley.</p>
<p>The sum that remained to her after the discharge of her <lb/>
debts, would quickly be expended. It was no argument of <lb/>
wisdom to lose sight of the future in the oblivion of present <lb/>
care. The time would inevitably come when new resources <lb/>
would be necessary. Every hour brought nearer the period <lb/>
without facilitating the discovery of new expedients. She <lb/>
related the recent adventure to her father. He acquiesced <lb/>
in the propriety of her measures, but the succor that she <lb/>
had thus obtained consoled him but little. He saw how <lb/>
speedily it would again be required, and was hopeless of a <lb/>
like fortunate occurrence.</p>
<p>Some days had elapsed, and Constantia had been so <lb/>
fortunate as to procure some employment. She was thus <lb/>
engaged in the evening when they were surprised by a visit <lb/>
from their landlord. This was an occurrence that <reg orig="forebod-|ed">foreboded</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="90" entity="eaf033v5_0103" pid="uva-lib:350369"/>
them no good. He entered with abruptness and <reg orig="scarce-|ly">scarcely</reg> <lb/>
noticed the salutations that he received. His bosom <lb/>
swelled with discontent, which seemed ready to be poured <lb/>
out upon his two companions. To the inquiry as to the <lb/>
condition of his health and that of his family, he surlily <lb/>
answered; never mind how I am. None the better for my <lb/>
tenants, I think. Never was a man so much plagued as I <lb/>
have been; what with one putting me off from time to <lb/>
time. What with another quarrelling about terms, and <lb/>
denying his agreement, and another running away in my <lb/>
debt, I expect nothing but to come to poverty, God help me, <lb/>
at last. But this was the worst of all. I was never before <lb/>
treated so in all my life. I don't know what or when I shall <lb/>
get to the end of my troubles. To be fobbed out of my <lb/>
rent and twenty five dollars into the bargain! It is very <lb/>
strange treatment, I assure you, Mr. Dudley.</p>
<p>What is it you mean? replied that gentleman. You have <lb/>
received your dues, and&mdash;</p>
<p>Received my dues, indeed! High enough too! I have <lb/>
received none of my dues. I have been imposed upon. <lb/>
I have been put to very great trouble and expect some <reg orig="com-|pensation">compensation</reg>. <lb/>
There is no knowing the character of one's <lb/>
tenants. There is nothing but knavery in the world, one <lb/>
would think. I'm sure no man has suffered more by bad <lb/>
tenants than I have. But this is the strangest treatment I <lb/>
ever met with. Very strange, indeed, and Dudley, I must <lb/>
be paid without delay. To lose my rent and twenty five <lb/>
dollars into the bargain, is too hard. I never met with the <lb/>
equal of it, not I. Besides, I wou'dn't be put to all this <lb/>
trouble for twice the sum.</p>
<p>What does all this mean, Mr. M'Crea? You seem <reg orig="in-|clined">inclined</reg> <lb/>
to scold, but I cannot conceive why you came here <lb/>
for that purpose. This behavior is improper&mdash;</p>
<p>No, it's very proper, and I want payment of my money. <lb/>
Fifty dollars you owe me. Miss comes to me to pay me <lb/>
my rent, as I thought. She brings me a fifty dollar note; I <lb/>
changes it for her, for I thought to be sure, I was quite safe; <lb/>
but, behold, when I sends it to the bank to get the money, <lb/>
they sends me back word that it's forged, and calls on me, <lb/>
before a magistrate to tell them where I got it from. I'm <lb/>
<pb n="91" entity="eaf033v5_0104" pid="uva-lib:350370"/>
sure I never was so flustered in my life. I would not have <lb/>
such a thing for ten times the sum.</p>
<p>He proceeded to descant on his loss without any <reg orig="interrup-|tion">interruption</reg> <lb/>
from his auditors, whom this intelligence had struck <lb/>
dumb. Mr. Dudley instantly saw the origin, and full extent <lb/>
of this misfortune. He was, nevertheless, calm, and <reg orig="indulg-|ed">indulged</reg> <lb/>
in no invectives against Craig. It is all of a piece, said <lb/>
he; our ruin is inevitable. Well, then let it come.</p>
<p>After M'Crea had railed himself weary, he flung out of <lb/>
the house, warning them that, next morning he should <lb/>
destrain for his rent, and, at the same time, sue them for the <lb/>
money that Constantia had received in exchange for her <lb/>
note. Miss Dudley was unable to pursue her task. She <lb/>
laid down her needle, and fixed her eyes upon her father. <lb/>
They had been engaged in earnest discourse when their <lb/>
landlord entered. Now there was a pause of profound <lb/>
silence, till the affectionate Lucy, who sufficiently <reg orig="compre-|hended">comprehended</reg> <lb/>
this scene, gave vent to her affliction in sobs. Her <lb/>
mistress turned to her.</p>
<p>Cheer up, my Lucy. We shall do well enough my girl. <lb/>
Our state is bad enough, without doubt, but despair will make <lb/>
it worse.</p>
<p>The anxiety that occupied her mind related less to <reg orig="her-|self">herself</reg>, <lb/>
than to her father. He, indeed, in the present instance, <lb/>
was exposed to prosecution. It was he who was answerable <lb/>
for the debt, and whose person would be thrown into <lb/>
durance by the suit that was menaced. The horrors of a <lb/>
prison had not hitherto been experienced, or anticipated. <lb/>
The worst evil that she had imagined was inexpressibly <reg orig="in-|ferior">inferior</reg> <lb/>
to this. The idea had in it something terrific and <lb/>
loathsome. The mere supposition of its being possible was <lb/>
not to be endured. If all other expedients should fail, she <lb/>
thought of nothing less than desperate resistance. No. It <lb/>
was better to die than to go to prison.</p>
<p>For a time, she was deserted of her admirable equanimity. <lb/>
This no doubt, was the result of surprise. She had not yet <lb/>
obtained the calmness necessary to deliberation. During <lb/>
this gloomy interval, she would, perhaps, have adopted any <lb/>
scheme, however dismal and atrocious, which her father's <lb/>
despair might suggest. She would not refuse to terminate <lb/>
<pb n="92" entity="eaf033v5_0105" pid="uva-lib:350371"/>
her own and her father's unfortunate existence, by poison or <lb/>
the chord.</p>
<p>This confusion of mind could not exist long. It gradually <lb/>
gave place to cheerful prospects. The evil perhaps was <lb/>
not without its timely remedy. The person whom she had <lb/>
set out to visit, when her course was diverted by Craig, she <lb/>
once more resolved to apply to; to lay before him, without <lb/>
reserve, her father's situation, to entreat pecuniary succor, <lb/>
and to offer herself as a servant in his family, or in that of <lb/>
any of his friends who stood in need of one. This <reg orig="resolu-|tion">resolution</reg>, <lb/>
in a slight degree, consoled her; but her mind had <lb/>
been too thoroughly disturbed to allow her any sleep during <lb/>
that night.</p>
<p>She equipped herself betimes, and proceeded with a <lb/>
doubting heart to the house of Mr. Melbourne. She was <lb/>
informed that he had risen, but was never to be seen at so <lb/>
early an hour. At nine o'clock he would be disengaged, <lb/>
and she would be admitted. In the present state of her <reg orig="af-|fairs">affairs</reg>, <lb/>
this delay was peculiarly unwelcome. At breakfast, <lb/>
her suspense and anxieties would not allow her to eat a <lb/>
morsel, and when the hour approached, she prepared <reg orig="her-|self">herself</reg> <lb/>
for a new attempt.</p>
<p>As she went out, she met at the door a person whom she <lb/>
recognized, and whose office she knew to be that of a <reg orig="consta-|ble">constable</reg>. <lb/>
Constantia had exercised, in her present narrow sphere, <lb/>
that beneficence which she had formerly exerted in a larger. <lb/>
There was nothing, consistent with her slender means, that <lb/>
she did not willingly perform for the service of others. She <lb/>
had not been sparing of consolation and personal aid in <reg orig="ma-|ny">many</reg> <lb/>
cases of personal distress that had occurred in her <lb/>
neighborhood. Hence, as far as she was known, she was <lb/>
reverenced.</p>
<p>The wife of their present visitant had experienced her <lb/>
succor and sympathy, on occasion of the death of a favorite <lb/>
child. The man, notwithstanding his office, was not of a <reg orig="rug-|ged">rugged</reg> <lb/>
or ungrateful temper. The task that was now imposed <lb/>
upon him, he undertook with extreme reluctance. He was <lb/>
somewhat reconciled to it by the reflection that another might <lb/>
not perform it with that gentleness and lenity, which he found <lb/>
in himself a disposition to exercise on all occasions, but <lb/>
particularly on the present.</p>
<pb n="93" entity="eaf033v5_0106" pid="uva-lib:350372"/>
<p>She easily guessed at his business, and having greeted him <lb/>
with the utmost friendliness, returned with him into the house. <lb/>
She endeavored to remove the embarrassment that hung <lb/>
about him, but in vain. Having levied what the law very <lb/>
properly calls a distress, he proceeded, after much hesitation, <lb/>
to inform Dudley that he was charged with a message from <lb/>
a Magistrate, summoning him to come forthwith, and account <lb/>
for having a forged bank note in his possession.</p>
<p>M'Crea had given no intimation of this. The painful <reg orig="sur-|prise">surprise</reg> <lb/>
that it produced, soon yielded to a just view of this <reg orig="af-|fair">affair</reg>. <lb/>
Temporary inconvenience and vexation was all that <lb/>
could be dreaded from it. Mr. Dudley hated to be seen or <lb/>
known. He usually walked out in the dusk of the evening, <lb/>
but limited his perambulations to a short space. At all other <lb/>
times, he was obstinately recluse. He was easily persuaded <lb/>
by his daughter to allow her to perform this unwelcome <reg orig="of-|fice">office</reg> <lb/>
in his stead. He had not received, nor even seen the <lb/>
note. He would have willingly spared her the mortification <lb/>
of a judicial examination, but he knew that this was <reg orig="una-|voidable">unavoidable</reg>. <lb/>
Should he comply with this summons himself, <lb/>
his daughter's presence would be equally necessary.</p>
<p>Influenced by these considerations, he was willing that his <lb/>
daughter should accompany the messenger, who was content <lb/>
that they should consult their mutual convenience in this <reg orig="re-|spect">respect</reg>. <lb/>
This interview was to her, not without its terrors, <lb/>
but she cherished the hope that it might ultimately conduce <lb/>
to good. She did not foresee the means by which this would <lb/>
be effected, but her heart was lightened by a secret and <reg orig="in-|explicable">inexplicable</reg> <lb/>
faith in the propitiousness of some event that was <lb/>
yet to occur. This faith was powerfully enforced when she <lb/>
reached the magistrate's door, and found that he was no other <lb/>
than Melbourne, whose succor she intended to solicit. She <lb/>
was speedily ushered, not into his office, but into a private <lb/>
apartment, where he received her alone.</p>
<p>He had been favorably prepossessed with regard to her <lb/>
character by the report of the officer, who, on being charged <lb/>
with the message, had accounted for the regret which he <lb/>
manifested, by dwelling on the merits of Miss Dudley. He <lb/>
behaved with grave civility, requested her to be seated, and <lb/>
accurately scrutinized her appearance. She found herself <lb/>
not deceived in her preconceptions of this gentleman's <reg orig="cha-|racter">character</reg>, <lb/>
<pb n="94" entity="eaf033v5_0107" pid="uva-lib:350373"/>
and drew a favorable omen as to the event of this <lb/>
interview, by what had already taken place. He viewed <lb/>
her in silence for some time, and then, in a conciliating tone, <lb/>
said.</p>
<p>It seems to me, madam, as if I had seen you before. <lb/>
Your face, indeed, is of that kind which, when once seen, <lb/>
is not easily forgotten. I know it is a long time since, <lb/>
but I cannot tell when or where. If you will not deem me <lb/>
impertinent, I will venture to ask you to assist my <reg orig="conjec-|tures">conjectures</reg>. <lb/>
Your name as I am informed, is Acworth.&mdash;I ought <lb/>
to have mentioned that Mr. Dudley on his removal from <lb/>
New York, among other expedients to obliterate the <reg orig="memo-|ry">memory</reg> <lb/>
of his former condition, and conceal his poverty from the <lb/>
world, had made this change in his name.</p>
<p>That, indeed, said the lady, is the name, which my father, <lb/>
at present, bears. His real name is Dudley. His abode <lb/>
was formerly in Queen Street, New York. Your <reg orig="conjec-|ture">conjecture</reg>, <lb/>
Sir, is not erroneous. This is not the first time we <lb/>
have seen each other. I well recollect your having been at <lb/>
my father's house in the days of his prosperity.</p>
<p>Is it possible? exclaimed Mr. Melbourne, starting from <lb/>
his seat in the first impulse of his astonishment. Are you <lb/>
the daughter of my friend Dudley, by whom I have so often <lb/>
been hospitably entertained. I have heard of his <reg orig="misfor-|tunes">misfortunes</reg>, <lb/>
but knew not that he was alive, or in what part of the <lb/>
world he resided.</p>
<p>You are summoned on a very disagreeable affair, but I <lb/>
doubt not, you will easily exculpate your father. I am <lb/>
told that he is blind, and that his situation is by no means <lb/>
as comfortable as might be wished. I am grieved that he <lb/>
did not confide in the friendship of those that knew him. <lb/>
What could prompt him to conceal himself?</p>
<p>My father has a proud spirit. It is not yet broken by <lb/>
adversity. He disdains <hi rend="italic">to beg,</hi> but I must now assume <hi rend="italic">that <lb/>
office</hi> for his sake. I came hither this morning to lay before <lb/>
you his situation, and to intreat your assistance to save him <lb/>
from a prison. He cannot pay for the poor tenement he <reg orig="oc-|cupies">occupies</reg>, <lb/>
and our few goods are already under distress. He <lb/>
has, likewise, contracted a debt. He is, I suppose, already <lb/>
sued on this account, and must go to gaol unless saved by <lb/>
the interposition of some friend.</p>
<pb n="95" entity="eaf033v5_0108" pid="uva-lib:350374"/>
<p>It is true, said Melbourne, I yesterday granted a warrant <lb/>
against him at the suit of Malcolm M'Crea. Little did I <lb/>
think that the defendant was Stephen Dudley; but you may <lb/>
dismiss all apprehensions on that score. That affair shall <lb/>
be settled to your father's satisfaction. Meanwhile, we will, <lb/>
if you please, despatch this unpleasant business respecting <lb/>
a counterfeit note, received in payment from you by this <lb/>
M'Crea.</p>
<p>Miss Dudley satisfactorily explained that affair. She <lb/>
stated the relation in which Craig had formerly stood to her <lb/>
father, and the acts of which he had been guilty. She <lb/>
slightly touched on the distresses which the family had <reg orig="un-|dergone">undergone</reg> <lb/>
during their abode in this city, and the means by <lb/>
which she had been able to preserve her father from want. <lb/>
She mentioned the circumstances which compelled her to <lb/>
seek his charity as the last resource, and the casual <reg orig="encount-|er">encounter</reg> <lb/>
with Craig, by which she was for the present diverted <lb/>
from that design. She laid before him a copy of the letter <lb/>
she had written, and explained the result in the gift of the <lb/>
note which now appeared to be a counterfeit. She <reg orig="conclud-|ed">concluded</reg> <lb/>
with stating her present views, and soliciting him to <reg orig="re-|ceive">receive</reg> <lb/>
her into his family, in quality of servant, or use his <lb/>
interest with some of his friends to procure a provision of <lb/>
this kind. This tale was calculated deeply to affect a man <lb/>
of Mr. Melbourne's humanity.</p>
<p>No, said he, I cannot listen to such a request. My <reg orig="in-|clination">inclination</reg> <lb/>
is bounded by my means. These will not allow me <lb/>
to place you in an independent situation; but I will do what <lb/>
I can. With your leave, I will introduce you to my wife, in <lb/>
your true character. Her good sense will teach her to set a <lb/>
just value on your friendship. There is no disgrace in <lb/>
earning your subsistence by your own industry. She and <lb/>
her friends will furnish you with plenty of materials, but if <lb/>
there ever be a deficiency, look to me for a supply.</p>
<p>Constantia's heart overflowed at this declaration. Her <lb/>
silence was more eloquent than any words could have been. <lb/>
She declined an immediate introduction to his wife, and <reg orig="with-|drew">withdrew</reg>, <lb/>
but not till her new friend had forced her to accept <lb/>
some money.</p>
<p>Place it to account, said he. It is merely paying you <lb/>
<pb n="96" entity="eaf033v5_0109" pid="uva-lib:350375"/>
before hand, and discharging a debt at the time when it <lb/>
happens to be most useful to the creditor.</p>
<p>To what entire and incredible reverses is the tenor of <lb/>
human life subject. A short minute shall effect a transition <lb/>
from a state utterly destitute of hope, to a condition where <lb/>
all is serene and abundant. The path, which we employ <lb/>
all our exertions to shun, is often found, upon trial, to be the <lb/>
true road to prosperity.</p>
<p>Constantia retired from this interview with a heart <reg orig="bound-|ing">bounding</reg> <lb/>
with exultation. She related to her father all that had <lb/>
happened. He was pleased on her account, but the <reg orig="detec-|tion">detection</reg> <lb/>
of his poverty by Melbourne was the parent of new <lb/>
mortification. His only remaining hope relative to himself, <lb/>
was that he should die in his obscurity, whereas, it was <lb/>
probable that his old acquaintance would trace him to his <lb/>
covert. This prognostic filled him with the deepest <reg orig="in-|quietude">inquietude</reg>, <lb/>
and all the reasonings of his daughter were <reg orig="in-|sufficient">insufficient</reg> <lb/>
to appease him.</p>
<p>Melbourne made his appearance in the afternoon. He <lb/>
was introduced, by Constantia, to her father. Mr. Dudley's <lb/>
figure was emaciated, and his features corroded by his <lb/>
ceaseless melancholy. His blindness produced in them a <lb/>
woeful and wildering expression. His dress betokened his <lb/>
penury, and was in unison with the meanness of his <reg orig="habita-|tion">habitation</reg> <lb/>
and furniture. The visitant was struck with the <reg orig="melan-|choly">melancholy</reg> <lb/>
contrast, which these appearances exhibited, to the <lb/>
joyousness and splendor that he had formerly witnessed.</p>
<p>Mr. Dudley received the salutations of his guest with an <lb/>
air of embarrassment and dejection. He resigned to his <lb/>
daughter the task of sustaining the conversation, and excused <lb/>
himself from complying with the urgent invitations of <lb/>
Melbourne, while at the same time, he studiously forbore all <lb/>
expressions tending to encourage any kind of intercourse <lb/>
between them.</p>
<p>The guest came with a message from his wife, who <reg orig="in-|treated">intreated</reg> <lb/>
Miss Dudley's company to tea with her that evening, <lb/>
adding that she should be entirely alone. It was <reg orig="impossi-|ble">impossible</reg> <lb/>
to refuse compliance with this request. She cheerfully <lb/>
assented, and, in the evening, was introduced to Mrs. <reg orig="Mel-|bourne">Melbourne</reg>, <lb/>
by her husband.</p>
<pb n="97" entity="eaf033v5_0110" pid="uva-lib:350376"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">9</fw></pb>
<p>Constantia found in this lady nothing that called for <reg orig="reve-|rence">reverence</reg> <lb/>
or admiration, though she could not deny her some <lb/>
portion of esteem. The impression which her own <reg orig="ap-|pearance">appearance</reg> <lb/>
and conversation made upon her entertainer, was <lb/>
much more powerful and favorable. A consciousness of <lb/>
her own worth, and disdain of the malevolence of fortune, <lb/>
perpetually shone forth in her behavior. It was modelled <lb/>
by a sort of mean between presumption on the one hand, <lb/>
and humility on the other. She claimed no more than what <lb/>
was justly due to her, but she claimed no less. She did <lb/>
not soothe our vanity nor fascinate our pity by diffident <reg orig="re-|serves">reserves</reg> <lb/>
and flutterings. Neither did she disgust by arrogant <lb/>
negligence, and uncircumspect loquacity.</p>
<p>At parting, she received commissions in the way of her <lb/>
profession, which supplied her with abundant and profitable <lb/>
employment. She abridged her visit on her father's account, <lb/>
and parted from her new friend just early enough to avoid <lb/>
meeting with Ormond, who entered the house a few minutes <lb/>
after she had left it.</p>
<p>What pity, said Melbourne to him, you did not come a <lb/>
little sooner. You pretend to be a judge of beauty. I <lb/>
should like to have heard your opinion of a face that has <lb/>
just left us.</p>
<p>Describe it, said the other.</p>
<p>That is beyond my capacity. Complexion, and hair, <lb/>
and eyebrows may be painted, but these are of no great <lb/>
value in the present case. It is in the putting them together, <lb/>
that nature has here shewn her skill, and not in the structure <lb/>
of each of the parts, individually considered. Perhaps you <lb/>
may at some time meet each other here. If a lofty fellow <lb/>
like you, now, would mix a little common sense with his <lb/>
science, this girl might hope for a husband, and her father <lb/>
for a natural protector.</p>
<p>Are they in search of one or the other?</p>
<p>I cannot say they are. Nay, I imagine they would bear <lb/>
any imputation with more patience than that, but certain I <lb/>
am, they stand in need of them. How much would it be <lb/>
to the honor of a man like you rioting in wealth, to divide <lb/>
it with one, lovely and accomplished as this girl is, and <lb/>
struggling with indigence.</p>
<pb n="98" entity="eaf033v5_0111" pid="uva-lib:350377"/>
<p>Melbourne then related the adventure of the morning. <lb/>
It was easy for Ormond to perceive that this was the same <lb/>
person of whom he already had some knowledge&mdash;but <lb/>
there were some particulars in the narrative that excited <lb/>
surprise. A note had been received from Craig, at the <lb/>
first visit in the evening, and this note was for no more than <lb/>
fifty dollars. This did not exactly tally with the information <lb/>
received from Craig. But this note was forged. Might <lb/>
not this girl mix a little imposture with her truth? Who <lb/>
knows her temptations to hypocrisy? It might have <lb/>
been a present from another quarter, and accompanied with <lb/>
no very honorable conditions. Exquisite wretch! Those <lb/>
whom honesty will not let live, must be knaves. Such is <lb/>
the alternative offered by the wisdom of society.</p>
<p>He listened to the tale with apparent indifference. He <lb/>
speedily shifted the conversation to new topics, and put an <lb/>
end to his visit sooner than ordinary.</p>

<div1 type="chapter" n="XII" id="d20">
<head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">I know</hi> no task more arduous than a just delineation of <lb/>
the character of Ormond. To scrutinize and ascertain our <lb/>
own principles are abundantly difficult. To exhibit these <lb/>
principles to the world with absolute sincerity, can scarcely <lb/>
be expected. We are prompted to conceal and to feign by <lb/>
a thousand motives; but truly to portray the motives, and <lb/>
relate the actions of another, appears utterly impossible. <lb/>
The attempt, however, if made with fidelity and diligence, <lb/>
is not without its use.</p>
<p>To comprehend the whole truth, with regard to the <lb/>
character and conduct of another, may be denied to any <lb/>
human being, but different observers will have, in their <reg orig="pic-|tures">pictures</reg>, <lb/>
a greater or less portion of this truth. No <reg orig="represen-|tation">representation</reg> <lb/>
will be wholly false, and some though not perfectly, <lb/>
may yet be considerably exempt from error.</p>
<p>Ormond was, of all mankind, the being most difficult and <lb/>
most deserving to be studied. A fortunate concurrence of <lb/>
incidents has unveiled his actions to me with more <reg orig="distinct-|ness">distinctness</reg> <lb/>
than to any other. My knowledge is far from being <lb/>
<pb n="99" entity="eaf033v5_0112" pid="uva-lib:350378"/>
absolute, but I am conscious of a kind of duty, first to my <lb/>
friend, and secondly to mankind, to impart the knowledge I <lb/>
possess.</p>
<p>I shall omit to mention the means by which I became <lb/>
acquainted with his character, nor shall I enter, at this time, <lb/>
into every part of it. His political projects are likely to <lb/>
possess an extensive influence on the future condition of this <lb/>
western world. I do not conceive myself authorized to <lb/>
communicate a knowledge of his schemes, which I gained, <lb/>
in some sort, surreptitiously, or at least, by means of which <lb/>
he was not apprized. I shall merely explain the maxims <lb/>
by which he was accustomed to regulate his private <reg orig="deport-|ment">deportment</reg>.</p>
<p>No one could entertain loftier conceptions of human <lb/>
capacity than Ormond, but he carefully distinguished between <lb/>
men, in the abstract, and men as they are. The former <lb/>
were beings to be impelled, by the breath of accident, in a <lb/>
right or a wrong road, but whatever direction they should <lb/>
receive, it was the property of their nature to persist in it. <lb/>
Now this impulse had been given. No single being could <lb/>
rectify the error. It was the business of the wise man to <lb/>
form a just estimate of things, but not to attempt, by <reg orig="indi-|vidual">individual</reg> <lb/>
efforts, so chimerical an enterprise as that of <reg orig="promot-|ing">promoting</reg> <lb/>
the happiness of mankind. Their condition was out <lb/>
of the reach of a member of a corrupt society to control. <lb/>
A mortal poison pervaded the whole system, by means of <lb/>
which every thing received was converted into bane and <lb/>
purulence. Efforts designed to ameliorate the condition of <lb/>
an individual, were sure of answering a contrary purpose. <lb/>
The principles of the social machine must be rectified, <reg orig="be-|fore">before</reg> <lb/>
men can be beneficially active. Our motives may be <lb/>
neutral or beneficent, but our actions tend merely to the <lb/>
production of evil.</p>
<p>The idea of total forbearance was not less delusive. Man <lb/>
could not be otherwise than a cause of perpetual operation <lb/>
and efficacy. He was part of a machine, and as such had <lb/>
not power to withhold his agency. Contiguousness to other <lb/>
parts, that is, to other men, was all that was necessary to <reg orig="ren-|der">render</reg> <lb/>
him a powerful concurrent. What then was the conduct <lb/>
incumbent on him? Whether he went forward, or stood <lb/>
still, whether his motives were malignant, or kind, or <reg orig="indiffer-|ent">indifferent</reg>, <lb/>
<pb n="100" entity="eaf033v5_0113" pid="uva-lib:350379"/>
the mass of evil was equally and necessarily augmented. <lb/>
It did not follow from these preliminaries that virtue and <lb/>
duty were terms without a meaning, but they require us to <lb/>
promote our own happiness and not the happiness of others. <lb/>
Not because the former end is intrinsically preferable, not <lb/>
because the happiness of others is unworthy of primary <lb/>
consideration, but because it is not to be attained. Our <lb/>
power in the present state of things is subjected to certain <lb/>
limits. A man may reasonably hope to accomplish his end, <lb/>
when he proposes nothing but his own good. Any other <lb/>
point is inaccessible.</p>
<p>He must not part with benevolent desire; this is a <reg orig="con-|stituent">constituent</reg> <lb/>
of happiness. He sees the value of general and <lb/>
particular felicity; he sometimes paints it to his fancy, but <lb/>
if this be rarely done, it is in consequence of virtuous <reg orig="sen-|sibility">sensibility</reg>, <lb/>
which is afflicted on observing that his pictures are <lb/>
reversed in the real state of mankind. A wise man will <lb/>
relinquish the pursuit of general benefit, but not the desire <lb/>
of that benefit, or the preception of that in which this <reg orig="bene-|fit">benefit</reg> <lb/>
consists, because these are among the ingredients of virtue <lb/>
and the sources of his happiness.</p>
<p>Principles, in the looser sense of that term, have little <lb/>
influence on practice. Ormond was, for the most part, <reg orig="gov-|erned">governed</reg>, <lb/>
like others, by the influences of education and present <lb/>
circumstances. It required a vigilant discernment to <reg orig="distin-|guish">distinguish</reg> <lb/>
whether the stream of his actions flowed from one or <lb/>
the other. His income was large, and he managed it <reg orig="near-|ly">nearly</reg> <lb/>
on the same principles as other men. He thought <reg orig="him-|self">himself</reg> <lb/>
entitled to all the splendor and ease which it would <lb/>
purchase, but his taste was elaborate and correct. He <reg orig="grati-|fied">gratified</reg> <lb/>
his love of the beautiful, because the sensations it <reg orig="af-|forded">afforded</reg> <lb/>
were pleasing, but made no sacrifices to the love of <lb/>
distinction. He gave no expensive entertainments for the <lb/>
sake of exciting the admiration of stupid gazers, or the <reg orig="flat-|tery">flattery</reg> <lb/>
or envy of those who shared them. Pompous <reg orig="equip-|age">equipage</reg> <lb/>
and retinue were modes of appropriating the esteem of <lb/>
mankind which he held in profound contempt. The garb <lb/>
of his attendants was fashioned after the model suggested <lb/>
by his imagination, and not in compliance with the dictates <lb/>
of custom.</p>
<p>He treated with systematic negligence, the etiquette that <lb/>
<pb n="101" entity="eaf033v5_0114" pid="uva-lib:350380"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">9*</fw></pb>
regulates the intercourse of persons of a certain class. He, <lb/>
every where, acted, in this respect, as if he were alone, or <lb/>
among familiar associates. The very appellations of Sir, <lb/>
and Madam, and Mister, were, in his apprehension, servile <lb/>
and ridiculous, and as custom or law had annexed no <reg orig="pen-|alty">penalty</reg> <lb/>
to the neglect of these, he conformed to his own <reg orig="opin-|ions">opinions</reg>. <lb/>
It was easier for him to reduce his notions of equality <lb/>
to practice than for most others. To level himself with <lb/>
others was an act of condescension and not of arrogance. <lb/>
It was requisite to descend rather than to rise; a task the <lb/>
most easy, if we regard the obstacles flowing from the <reg orig="preju-|dice">prejudice</reg> <lb/>
of mankind, but far most difficult, if the motives of the <lb/>
agent be considered.</p>
<p>That in which he chiefly placed his boast, was his <reg orig="sinceri-|ty">sincerity</reg>. <lb/>
To this he refused no sacrifice. In consequence of <lb/>
this, his deportment was disgusting to weak minds, by a <lb/>
certain air of ferocity and haughty negligence. He was <lb/>
without the attractions of candor, because he regarded not <lb/>
the happiness of others, but in subservience to his sincerity. <lb/>
Hence it was natural to suppose that the character of this <lb/>
man was easily understood. He affected to conceal nothing. <lb/>
No one appeared more exempt from the instigations of <reg orig="van-|ity">vanity</reg>. <lb/>
He set light by the good opinions of others, had no <lb/>
compassion for their prejudices, and hazarded assertions in <lb/>
their presence which he knew would be, in the highest <reg orig="de-|gree">degree</reg>, <lb/>
shocking to their previous notions. They might take <lb/>
it, he would say, as they list. Such were his conceptions, <lb/>
and the last thing he would give up was the use of his tongue. <lb/>
It was his way to give utterance to the suggestions of his <lb/>
understanding. If they were disadvantageous to him in the <lb/>
opinions of others, it was well. He did not wish to be <reg orig="re-|garded">regarded</reg> <lb/>
in any light, but the true one. He was contented <lb/>
to be rated by the world, at his just value. If they esteemed <lb/>
him for qualities he did not possess, was he wrong in <reg orig="recti-|fying">rectifying</reg> <lb/>
their mistake; but in reality, if they valued him for <lb/>
that to which he had no claim, and which he himself <reg orig="con-|sidered">considered</reg> <lb/>
as contemptible, he must naturally desire to shew <lb/>
them their error, and forfeit that praise which, in his own <lb/>
opinion, was a badge of infamy.</p>
<p>In listening to his discourse, no one's claim to sincerity <lb/>
<pb n="102" entity="eaf033v5_0115" pid="uva-lib:350381"/>
appeared less questionable. A somewhat different <reg orig="conclu-|sion">conclusion</reg> <lb/>
would be suggested by a survey of his actions. In <lb/>
early youth he discovered in himself a remarkable facility in <lb/>
imitating the voice and gestures of others. His memory <lb/>
was eminently retentive, and these qualities would have <reg orig="ren-|dered">rendered</reg> <lb/>
his career, in the theatrical profession, illustrious, had <lb/>
not his condition raised him above it. His talents were <lb/>
occasionally exerted for the entertainment of convivial <reg orig="par-|ties">parties</reg>, <lb/>
and private circles, but he gradually withdrew from <lb/>
such scenes, as he advanced in age, and devoted his abilities <lb/>
to higher purposes.</p>
<p>His aversion to duplicity had flowed from experience of <lb/>
its evils. He had frequently been made its victim; in <lb/>
consequence of this his temper had become suspicious, <lb/>
and he was apt to impute deceit on occasions when others, <lb/>
of no inconsiderable sagacity, were abundantly disposed to <lb/>
confidence. One transaction had occurred in his life, in <lb/>
which the consequences of being misled by false <reg orig="appear-|ances">appearances</reg> <lb/>
were of the utmost moment to his honor and <reg orig="safe-|ty">safety</reg>. <lb/>
The usual mode of solving his doubts, he deemed <reg orig="in-|sufficient">insufficient</reg>, <lb/>
and the eagerness of his curiosity tempted him, <lb/>
for the first time, to employ, for this end, his talents at <reg orig="imita-|tion">imitation</reg>. <lb/>
He therefore assumed a borrowed character and guise, <lb/>
and performed his part with so much skill as fully to <reg orig="accom-|plish">accomplish</reg> <lb/>
his design. He whose mask would have secured him <lb/>
from all other attempts, was thus taken through an avenue <lb/>
which his caution had overlooked, and the hypocrisy of his <lb/>
pretensions unquestionably ascertained.</p>
<p>Perhaps, in a comprehensive view, the success of this <lb/>
expedient was unfortunate. It served to recommend this <lb/>
method of encountering deceit, and informed him of the <reg orig="ex-|tent">extent</reg> <lb/>
of those powers which are so liable to be abused. A <lb/>
subtlety much inferior to Ormond's would suffice to <reg orig="recom-|mend">recommend</reg> <lb/>
this mode of action. It was defensible on no other <lb/>
principle than necessity. The treachery of mankind <reg orig="compel-|led">compelled</reg> <lb/>
him to resort to it. If they should deal in a manner as <lb/>
upright and explicit as himself, it would be superfluous. But <lb/>
since they were in the perpetual use of stratagems and <reg orig="arti-|fices">artifices</reg>, <lb/>
it was allowable, he thought, to wield the same arms.</p>
<p>It was easy to perceive, however, that this practice was <lb/>
recommended to him by other considerations. He was <reg orig="de-|lighted">delighted</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="103" entity="eaf033v5_0116" pid="uva-lib:350382"/>
with the power it conferred. It enabled him to gain <lb/>
access, as if by supernatural means, to the privacy of others, <lb/>
and baffle their profoundest contrivances to hide themselves <lb/>
from his view. It flattered him with the possession of <reg orig="some-|thing">something</reg> <lb/>
like omniscience. It was besides an art, in which, as <lb/>
in others, every accession of skill, was a source of new <lb/>
gratification. Compared with this the performance of the <lb/>
actor is the sport of children. This profession he was <reg orig="ac-|customed">accustomed</reg> <lb/>
to treat with merciless ridicule, and no doubt, some <lb/>
of his contempt arose from a secret comparison, between <lb/>
the theatrical species of imitation and his own. He blended <lb/>
in his own person the functions of poet and actor, and his <lb/>
dramas were not fictitious but real. The end that he <reg orig="pro-|posed">proposed</reg> <lb/>
was not the amusement of a playhouse mob. His <lb/>
were scenes in which hope and fear exercised a genuine <lb/>
influence, and in which was maintained that resemblance <lb/>
to truth, so audaciously and grossly violated on the stage.</p>
<p>It is obvious how many singular conjunctures must have <lb/>
grown out of this propensity. A mind of uncommon energy <lb/>
like Ormond's, which had occupied a wide sphere of action, <lb/>
and which could not fail of confederating its efforts with those <lb/>
of minds like itself, must have given birth to innumerable <reg orig="in-|cidents">incidents</reg>, <lb/>
not unworthy to be exhibited by the most eloquent <lb/>
historian. It is not my business to relate any of these. The <lb/>
fate of Miss Dudley is intimately connected with his. What <lb/>
influence he obtained over her destiny, in consequence of <lb/>
this dexterity, will appear in the sequel.</p>
<p>It arose from these circumstances, that no one was more <lb/>
impenetrable than Ormond, though no one's real character <lb/>
seemed more easily discerned. The projects that occupied <lb/>
his attention were diffused over an ample space; and his <reg orig="in-|struments">instruments</reg> <lb/>
and coadjutors were culled from a field, whose <lb/>
bounds were those of the civilized world. To the vulgar <lb/>
eye, therefore, he appeared a man of speculation and <reg orig="seclu-|sion">seclusion</reg>, <lb/>
and was equally inscrutible in his real and assumed <lb/>
characters. In his real, his intents were too lofty and <reg orig="com-|prehensive">comprehensive</reg>, <lb/>
as well as too assiduously shrouded from profane <lb/>
inspection, for them to scan. In the latter, appearances <lb/>
were merely calculated to mislead and not to enlighten.</p>
<p>In his youth he had been guilty of the usual excesses <reg orig="in-|cident">incident</reg> <lb/>
to his age and character. These had disappeared <lb/>
<pb n="104" entity="eaf033v5_0117" pid="uva-lib:350383"/>
and yielded place to a more regular and circumspect system <lb/>
of action. In the choice of his pleasures he still exposed <lb/>
himself to the censure of the world. Yet there was more of <lb/>
grossness and licentiousness in the expression of his tenets, <lb/>
than in the tenets themselves. So far as temperance regards <lb/>
the maintenance of health, no man adhered to its precepts <lb/>
with more fidelity, but he esteemed some species of <reg orig="connex-|ion">connexion</reg> <lb/>
with the other sex as venial, which mankind in general <lb/>
are vehement in condemning.</p>
<p>In his intercourse with women, he deemed himself <reg orig="supe-|rior">superior</reg> <lb/>
to the allurements of what is called love. His <reg orig="infer-|ences">inferences</reg> <lb/>
were drawn from a consideration of the physical <reg orig="pro-|pensities">propensities</reg> <lb/>
of a human being. In his scale of enjoyments the <lb/>
gratifications which belonged to these, were placed at the <lb/>
bottom. Yet he did not entirely disdain them, and when <lb/>
they could be purchased without the sacrifice of superior <lb/>
advantages, they were sufficiently acceptable.</p>
<p>His mistake on this head was the result of his ignorance. <lb/>
He had not hitherto met with a female worthy of his <reg orig="confi-|dence">confidence</reg>. <lb/>
Their views were limited and superficial, or their <lb/>
understandings were betrayed by the tenderness of their <lb/>
hearts. He found in them no intellectual energy, no <reg orig="supe-|riority">superiority</reg> <lb/>
to what he accounted vulgar prejudice, and no affinity <lb/>
with the sentiments which he cherished with most devotion. <lb/>
Their presence had been capable of exciting no emotion <lb/>
which he did not quickly discover to be vague and sensual; <lb/>
and the uniformity of his experience at length instilled into <lb/>
him a belief, that the intellectual constitution of females was <lb/>
essentially defective. He denied the reality of that passion <lb/>
which claimed a similitude or sympathy of minds as one of <lb/>
its ingredients.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XIII.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">He</hi> resided in New York some time before he took up his <lb/>
abode in Philadelphia. He had some pecuniary concerns <lb/>
with a merchant of that place. He occasionally frequented <lb/>
his house, finding, in the society which it afforded him, scope <lb/>
for amusing speculation, and opportunities of gaining a <reg orig="spe-|cies">species</reg> <lb/>
of knowledge of which at that time he stood in need. <lb/>
<pb n="105" entity="eaf033v5_0118" pid="uva-lib:350384"/>
There was one daughter of the family who of course <reg orig="consti-|tuted">constituted</reg> <lb/>
a member of the domestic circle.</p>
<p>Helena Cleves was endowed with every feminine and <lb/>
fascinating quality. Her features were modified by the most <lb/>
transient sentiments and were the seat of a softness at all <lb/>
times blushful and bewitching. All those graces of <reg orig="symme-|try">symmetry</reg>, <lb/>
smoothness and lustre, which assemble in the <reg orig="imagina-|tion">imagination</reg> <lb/>
of the painter when he calls from the bosom of her <reg orig="na-|tal">natal</reg> <lb/>
deep, the Paphian divinity, blended their perfections in the <lb/>
shade, complexion, and hair of this lady. Her voice was <lb/>
naturally thrilling and melodious, and her utterance clear <lb/>
and distinct. A musical education had added to all these <lb/>
advantages the improvements of art, and no one could swim <lb/>
in the dance with such airy and transporting elegance.</p>
<p>It is obvious to inquire whether her mental, were, in any <reg orig="de-|gree">degree</reg>, <lb/>
on a level with her exterior accomplishments. Should <lb/>
you listen to her talk, you would be liable to be deceived in <lb/>
this respect. Her utterance was so just, her phrases so <reg orig="hap-|py">happy</reg>, <lb/>
and her language so copious and correct, that the hearer <lb/>
was apt to be impressed with an ardent veneration of her <lb/>
abilities, but the truth is, she was calculated to excite <reg orig="emo-|tions">emotions</reg> <lb/>
more voluptuous than dignified. Her presence <reg orig="pro-|duced">produced</reg> <lb/>
a trance of the senses rather than an illumination of <lb/>
the soul. It was a topic of wonder how she should have so <lb/>
carefully separated the husk from the kernel, and be so <reg orig="ab-|solute">absolute</reg> <lb/>
a mistress of the vehicle of knowledge, with so slender <lb/>
means of supplying it; yet it is difficult to judge but from <lb/>
comparison. To say that Helena Cleves was silly or <reg orig="igno-|rant">ignorant</reg> <lb/>
would be hatefully unjust. Her understanding bore no <lb/>
disadvantageous comparison with that of the majority of her <lb/>
sex, but when placed in competition with that of some <reg orig="emi-|nent">eminent</reg> <lb/>
females or of Ormond, it was exposed to the risk of <lb/>
contempt.</p>
<p>This lady and Ormond were exposed to mutual <reg orig="examina-|tion">examination</reg>. <lb/>
The latter was not unaffected by the radiance that <lb/>
environed this girl, but her true character was easily <reg orig="discov-|ered">discovered</reg>, <lb/>
and he was accustomed to regard her merely as an <lb/>
object charming to the senses. His attention to her was <lb/>
dictated by this principle. When she sung or talked, it was <lb/>
not unworthy of the strongest mind to be captivated with her <lb/>
music and her elocution; but these were the limits which he <lb/>
<pb n="106" entity="eaf033v5_0119" pid="uva-lib:350385"/>
set to his gratifications. That sensations of a different kind, <lb/>
never ruffled his tranquillity must not be supposed, but he too <lb/>
accurately estimated their consequences to permit himself to <lb/>
indulge them.</p>
<p>Unhappily the lady did not exercise equal fortitude. <reg orig="Dur-|ing">During</reg> <lb/>
a certain interval Ormond's visits were frequent, and she <lb/>
insensibly contracted for him somewhat more than reverence. <lb/>
The tenor of his discourse was little adapted to cherish her <lb/>
hopes. In the declaration of his opinions he was never <reg orig="with-|held">withheld</reg> <lb/>
by scruples of decorum, or a selfish regard to his own <lb/>
interest. His matrimonial tenets were harsh and repulsive. <lb/>
A woman of keener penetration would have predicted from <lb/>
them, the disappointment of her wishes, but Helena's mind <lb/>
was uninured to the discussion of logical points and the <lb/>
tracing of remote consequences. His presence inspired <reg orig="feel-|ings">feelings</reg> <lb/>
which would not permit her to bestow an impartial <reg orig="at-|tention">attention</reg> <lb/>
on his arguments. It is not enough to say that his <lb/>
reasonings failed to convince her; the combined influence <lb/>
of passion and an unenlightened understanding hindered her <lb/>
from fully comprehending them. All she gathered was a <lb/>
vague conception of something magnificent and vast in his <lb/>
character.</p>
<p>Helena was destined to experience the vicissitudes of <reg orig="for-|tune">fortune</reg>. <lb/>
Her father died suddenly and left her without <reg orig="pro-|vision">provision</reg>. <lb/>
She was compelled to accept the invitations of a <lb/>
kinswoman, and live, in some sort, a life of dependence. She <lb/>
was not qualified to sustain this reverse of fortune, in a <reg orig="grace-|ful">graceful</reg> <lb/>
manner. She could not bear the diminution of her <reg orig="cus-|tomary">customary</reg> <lb/>
indulgences, and to these privations were added the <lb/>
inquietudes of a passion, which now began to look with an <lb/>
aspect of hopelessness.</p>
<p>These events happened in the absence of Ormond. On <lb/>
his return he made himself acquainted with them. He saw <lb/>
the extent of this misfortune to a woman of Helena's <reg orig="char-|acter">character</reg>, <lb/>
but knew not in what manner it might be effectually <lb/>
obviated. He esteemed it incumbent on him to pay her a <lb/>
visit in her new abode. This token at least of respect or <lb/>
remembrance his duty appeared to prescribe.</p>
<p>This visit was unexpected by the lady. Surprise is the <lb/>
enemy of concealment. She was oppressed with a sense of <lb/>
her desolate situation. She was sitting in her own <reg orig="apart-|ment">apartment</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="107" entity="eaf033v5_0120" pid="uva-lib:350386"/>
in a museful posture. Her fancy was occupied with <lb/>
the image of Ormond, and her tears were flowing at the <lb/>
thought of their eternal separation, when he entered softly <lb/>
and unperceived by her. A tap upon the shoulder was the <lb/>
first signal of his presence. So critical an interview could <lb/>
not fail of unveiling the true state of the lady's heart. <reg orig="Or-|mond's">Ormond's</reg> <lb/>
suspicions were excited, and these suspicions speedily <lb/>
led to an explanation.</p>
<p>Ormond retired to ruminate on this discovery. I have <lb/>
already mentioned his sentiments respecting love. His <reg orig="feel-|ings">feelings</reg> <lb/>
relative to Helena did not contradict his principles, yet <lb/>
the image which had formerly been exquisite in loveliness, <lb/>
had now suddenly gained unspeakable attractions. This <lb/>
discovery had set the question in a new light. It was of <reg orig="suf-|ficient">sufficient</reg> <lb/>
importance to make him deliberate. He reasoned <lb/>
somewhat in the following manner.</p>
<p>Marriage is absurd. This flows from the general and <reg orig="in-|curable">incurable</reg> <lb/>
imperfection of the female character. No woman <lb/>
can possess that worth which would induce me to enter into <lb/>
this contract, and bind myself, without power of revoking <lb/>
the decree, to her society. This opinion may possibly be <lb/>
erroneous, but it is undoubtedly true with respect to Helena, <lb/>
and the uncertainty of the position in general, will increase <lb/>
the necessity of caution in the present case. That woman <lb/>
may exist whom I should not fear to espouse. This is not <lb/>
her. Some accident may cause our meeting. Shall I then <lb/>
disable myself, by an irrevocable obligation, from profiting <lb/>
by so auspicious an occurrence?</p>
<p>This girl's society was to be enjoyed in one of two ways. <lb/>
Should he consult his inclination there was little room for <lb/>
doubt. He had never met with one more highly qualified <lb/>
for that species of intercourse which he esteemed rational. <lb/>
No man more abhorred the votaries of licentiousness. <reg orig="Noth-|ing">Nothing</reg> <lb/>
was more detestable to him than a mercenary alliance. <lb/>
Personal fidelity and the existence of that passion, of which <lb/>
he had, in the present case, the good fortune to be the <reg orig="ob-|ject">object</reg>, <lb/>
were indispensable in his scheme. The union was <reg orig="in-|debted">indebted</reg> <lb/>
for its value on the voluntariness with which it was <lb/>
formed, and the entire acquiescence of the judgment of both <lb/>
parties in its rectitude. Dissimulation and artifice were <lb/>
wholly foreign to the success of his project. If the lady <lb/>
<pb n="108" entity="eaf033v5_0121" pid="uva-lib:350387"/>
thought proper to assent to his proposal, it was well. She <lb/>
did so because assent was more eligible than refusal.</p>
<p>She would, no doubt, prefer marriage. She would deem <lb/>
it more conducive to happiness. This was an error. This <lb/>
was an opinion, his reasons for which he was at liberty to <lb/>
state to her; at least it was justifiable in refusing to subject <lb/>
himself to loathsome and impracticable obligations. <reg orig="Cer-|tain">Certain</reg> <lb/>
inconveniences attended women who set aside, on these <lb/>
occasions, the sanction of law, but these were imaginary. <lb/>
They owed their force to the errors of the sufferer. To <lb/>
annihilate them, it was only necessary to reason justly, but <lb/>
allowing these inconveniences their full weight and an <reg orig="inde-|structable">indestructable</reg> <lb/>
existence, it was but a choice of evils. Were they <lb/>
worse in this lady's apprehension, than an eternal and <reg orig="hope-|less">hopeless</reg> <lb/>
separation? Perhaps they were. If so, she would <lb/>
make her election accordingly. He did nothing but lay the <lb/>
conditions before her. If his scheme should obtain the <reg orig="con-|currence">concurrence</reg> <lb/>
of her unbiassed judgment he should rejoice. If <lb/>
not, her conduct should be uninfluenced by him. <reg orig="Whatev-|er">Whatever</reg> <lb/>
way she should decide, he would assist her in adhering to <lb/>
her decision, but would, meanwhile, furnish her with the <lb/>
materials of a right decision.</p>
<p>This determination was singular. Many will regard it as <lb/>
incredible. No man, it will be thought, can put this <reg orig="decep-|tion">deception</reg> <lb/>
on himself, and imagine that there was genuine <reg orig="benefi-|cence">beneficence</reg> <lb/>
in a scheme like this. Would the lady more consult <lb/>
her happiness by adopting than by rejecting it? There can <lb/>
be but one answer. It cannot be supposed that Ormond, in <lb/>
stating this proposal, acted with all the impartiality that he <lb/>
pretended; that he did not employ fallacious exaggerations <lb/>
and ambiguous expedients; that he did not seize every <reg orig="op-|portunity">opportunity</reg> <lb/>
of triumphing over her weakness, and building his <lb/>
success rather on the illusions of her heart than the <reg orig="con-|victions">convictions</reg> <lb/>
of her understanding. His conclusions were <reg orig="spe-|cious">specious</reg> <lb/>
but delusive, and were not uninfluenced by improper <lb/>
biasses; but of this he himself was scarcely conscious, and it <lb/>
must be, at least, admitted that he acted with scrupulous <lb/>
sincerity.</p>
<p>An uncommon degree of skill was required to introduce <lb/>
this topic so as to avoid the imputation of an insult. This <lb/>
scheme was little in unison with all her preconceived notions. <lb/>
<pb n="109" entity="eaf033v5_0122" pid="uva-lib:350388"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">10</fw></pb>
No doubt, the irksomeness of her present situation, the <reg orig="allure-|ments">allurements</reg> <lb/>
of luxury and ease, which Ormond had to bestow, <lb/>
and the revival of her ancient independence and security, <lb/>
had some share in dictating her assent.</p>
<p>Her concurrence was by no means cordial and <reg orig="unhesi-|tating">unhesitating</reg>. <lb/>
Remorse and the sense of dishonor pursued her to her <lb/>
retreat, though chosen with a view of shunning their <reg orig="intru-|sions">intrusions</reg>, <lb/>
and it was only when the reasonings and blandishments <lb/>
of her lover were exhibited, that she was lulled into <reg orig="tempo-|rary">temporary</reg> <lb/>
tranquillity.</p>
<p>She removed to Philadelphia. Here she enjoyed all the <lb/>
consolations of opulence. She was mistress of a small but <lb/>
elegant mansion. She possessed all the means of solitary <lb/>
amusement, and frequently enjoyed the company of Ormond. <lb/>
These however were insufficient to render her happy. <reg orig="Cer-|tain">Certain</reg> <lb/>
reflections might, for a time, be repressed or divested <lb/>
of their sting, but they insinuated themselves at every <reg orig="inter-|val">interval</reg>, <lb/>
and imparted to her mind, a hue of dejection from which <lb/>
she could not entirely relieve herself.</p>
<p>She endeavored to acquire a relish for the pursuits of <lb/>
literature, by which her lonely hours might be cheered; but <lb/>
of this, even in the blithesomeness and serenity of her <reg orig="for-|mer">former</reg> <lb/>
days, she was incapable. Much more so now when <lb/>
she was the prey of perpetual inquietude. Ormond <reg orig="perceiv-|ed">perceived</reg> <lb/>
this change, not without uneasiness. All his efforts to <lb/>
reconcile her to her present situation were fruitless. They <lb/>
produced a momentary effect upon her. The softness of <lb/>
her temper and her attachment to him, would, at his <reg orig="bid-|ding">bidding</reg>, <lb/>
restore her to vivacity and ease, but the illumination <lb/>
seldom endured longer than his presence, and the novelty of <lb/>
some amusement which he had furnished her.</p>
<p>At his next visit, perhaps, he would find that a new task <lb/>
awaited him. She indulged herself in no recriminations or <lb/>
invectives. She could not complain that her lover had <reg orig="de-|ceived">deceived</reg> <lb/>
her. She had voluntarily and deliberately accepted <lb/>
the conditions prescribed. She regarded her own <reg orig="disposi-|tion">disposition</reg> <lb/>
to repine as a species of injustice. She laid no claim to <lb/>
an increase of tenderness. She hinted not a wish for a <lb/>
change of situation; yet she was unhappy. Tears stole into <lb/>
her eyes, and her thoughts wandered into gloomy reverie, at <lb/>
<pb n="110" entity="eaf033v5_0123" pid="uva-lib:350389"/>
moments when least aware of their reproach, and least <reg orig="will-|ing">willing</reg> <lb/>
to indulge them.</p>
<p>Was a change to be desired? Yes; provided that <lb/>
change was equally agreeable to Ormond, and should be <lb/>
seriously proposed by him, of this she had no hope. As <lb/>
long as his accents rung in her ears, she even doubted <reg orig="whe-|ther">whether</reg> <lb/>
it were to be wished. At any rate, it was impossible <lb/>
to gain his approbation to it. Her destiny was fixed. It <lb/>
was better than the cessation of all intercourse, yet her heart <lb/>
was a stranger to all permanent tranquillity.</p>
<p>Her manners were artless and ingenuous. In company <lb/>
with Ormond her heart was perfectly unveiled. He was her <lb/>
divinity to whom every sentiment was visible, and to whom <lb/>
she spontaneously uttered what she thought, because the <lb/>
employment was pleasing; because he listened with <reg orig="appa-|rent">apparent</reg> <lb/>
satisfaction; and because, in fine, it was the same thing <lb/>
to speak and to think in his presence. There was no <reg orig="in-|ducement">inducement</reg> <lb/>
to conceal from him the most evanescent and <reg orig="fu-|gitive">fugitive</reg> <lb/>
ideas.</p>
<p>Ormond was not an inattentive or indifferent spectator of <lb/>
those appearances. His friend was unhappy. She shrunk <lb/>
aghast from her own reproaches and the contumelies of the <lb/>
world. This morbid sensibility he had endeavored to cure, <lb/>
but hitherto in vain. What was the amount of her <reg orig="unhappi-|ness">unhappiness</reg>? <lb/>
Her spirits had formerly been gay, but her gaiety <lb/>
was capable of yielding place to soul-ravishing and solemn <lb/>
tenderness. Her sedateness was, at those times, the <reg orig="off-|spring">offspring</reg> <lb/>
not of reflection but of passion. There still <reg orig="remain-|ed">remained</reg> <lb/>
much of her former self. He was seldom permitted to <lb/>
witness more than the traces of sorrow. In answer to his <lb/>
inquiries, she, for the most part, described sensations that <lb/>
were gone, and which she flattered herself and him would <lb/>
never return; but this hope was always doomed to <reg orig="disap-|pointment">disappointment</reg>. <lb/>
Solitude infallibly conjured up the ghost which <lb/>
had been laid, and it was plain that argument was no <reg orig="ade-|quate">adequate</reg> <lb/>
remedy for this disease.</p>
<p>How far would time alleviate its evils? When the novelty <lb/>
of her condition should disappear, would she not regard it <lb/>
with other eyes? By being familiar with contempt, it will <lb/>
lose its sting; but is that to be wished? Must not the <reg orig="charac-|ter">character</reg> <lb/>
be thoroughly depraved before the scorn of our neighbors <lb/>
<pb n="111" entity="eaf033v5_0124" pid="uva-lib:350390"/>
shall become indifferent? Indifference, flowing from a sense <lb/>
of justice, and a persuasion that our treatment is unmerited, <lb/>
is characteristic of the noblest minds, but indifference to <reg orig="ob-|loquy">obloquy</reg>, <lb/>
because we are habituated to it, is a token of peculiar <lb/>
baseness. This therefore was a remedy to be ardently <reg orig="de-|precated">deprecated</reg>.</p>
<p>He had egregiously overrated the influence of truth and <lb/>
his own influence. He had hoped that his victory was <reg orig="per-|manent">permanent</reg>. <lb/>
In order to the success of truth, he was apt to <lb/>
imagine, that nothing was needful but opportunities for a <lb/>
complete exhibition of it. They that inquire and reason <lb/>
with sufficient deliberateness and caution, must inevitably <lb/>
accomplish their end. These maxims were confuted in the <lb/>
present case. He had formed no advantageous conceptions <lb/>
of Helena's capacity. His aversion to matrimony arose from <lb/>
those conceptions, but experience had shown him that his <lb/>
conclusions, unfavorable as they were, had fallen short of <lb/>
the truth. Convictions, which he had conceived her mind <lb/>
to be sufficiently strong to receive and retain, were proved <lb/>
to have made no other, than a momentary impression. <lb/>
Hence his objections to ally himself to a mind inferior to his <lb/>
own were strengthened rather than diminished. But he <lb/>
could not endure the thought of being instrumental to her <lb/>
misery.</p>
<p>Marriage was an efficacious remedy, but he could not as <lb/>
yet bring himself to regard the aptitude of this cure as a <reg orig="sub-|ject">subject</reg> <lb/>
of doubt. The idea of separation sometimes occurred <lb/>
to him. He was not unapprehensive of the influence of <lb/>
time and absence, in curing the most vehement passion, but <lb/>
to this expedient the lady could not be reconciled. He <lb/>
knew her too well to believe that she would willingly adopt <lb/>
it. But the only obstacle to this scheme did not flow from <lb/>
the lady's opposition. He would probably have found upon <lb/>
experiment as strong an aversion to adopt it in himself as <lb/>
in her.</p>
<p>It was easy to see the motives by which he would be <reg orig="like-|ly">likely</reg> <lb/>
to be swayed into a change of principles. If marriage <lb/>
were the only remedy, the frequent repetition of this truth <lb/>
must bring him insensibly to doubt the rectitude of his <reg orig="de-|terminations">determinations</reg> <lb/>
against it. He deeply reflected on the <reg orig="conse-|quences">consequences</reg> <lb/>
which marriage involves. He scrutinized with the <lb/>
<pb n="112" entity="eaf033v5_0125" pid="uva-lib:350391"/>
utmost accuracy, the character of his friend, and surveyed <lb/>
it in all its parts. Inclination could not fail of having some <lb/>
influence on his opinions. The charms of this favorite <reg orig="ob-|ject">object</reg> <lb/>
tended to impair the clearness of his view, and <reg orig="extenu-|ate">extenuate</reg> <lb/>
or conceal her defects. He entered on the enumeration <lb/>
of her errors with reluctance. Her happiness had it been <lb/>
wholly disconnected with his own, might have had less <lb/>
weight in the balance, but now, every time the scales were <lb/>
suspended, this consideration acquired new weight.</p>
<p>Most men are influenced, in the formation of this contract, <lb/>
by regards purely physical. They are incapable of higher <lb/>
views. They regard with indifference every tie that binds <lb/>
them to their contemporaries, or to posterity. Mind has no <lb/>
part in the motives that guide them. They choose a wife <lb/>
as they choose any household moveable, and when the <reg orig="irri-|tation">irritation</reg> <lb/>
of the senses has subsided, the attachment that remains <lb/>
is the offspring of habit.</p>
<p>Such were not Ormond's modes of thinking. His creed <lb/>
was of too extraordinary a kind not to merit explication. <lb/>
The terms of this contract were, in his eyes, iniquitous and <lb/>
absurd. He could not think with patience of a promise <lb/>
which no time could annul, which pretended to ascertain <lb/>
contingences and regulate the future. To forego the liberty <lb/>
of choosing his companion, and bind himself to associate <lb/>
with one whom he despised, to raise to his own level one <lb/>
whom nature had irretrievably degraded; to avow, and <lb/>
persist in his adherence to a falsehood, palpable and <reg orig="loath-|some">loathsome</reg> <lb/>
to his understanding; to affirm that he was blind, when <lb/>
in full possession of his senses; to shut his eyes and grope <lb/>
in the dark, and call upon the compassion of mankind on his <lb/>
infirmity, when his organs were, in no degree, impaired, and <lb/>
the scene around him was luminous and beautiful, was an <lb/>
height of infatuation that he could never attain. And why <lb/>
should he be thus self-degraded? Why should he take a <lb/>
laborious circuit to reach a point which, when attained, was <lb/>
trivial, and to which reason had pointed out a road short and <lb/>
direct?</p>
<p>A wife is generally nothing more than a household <reg orig="super-|intendent">superintendent</reg>. <lb/>
This function could not be more wisely vested <lb/>
than it was at present. Every thing, in his domestic system, <lb/>
was fashioned on strict and inflexible principles. He <reg orig="want-|ed">wanted</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="113" entity="eaf033v5_0126" pid="uva-lib:350392"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">10*</fw></pb>
instruments and not partakers of his authority. One <lb/>
whose mind was equal and not superior to the cogent <reg orig="appre-|hension">apprehension</reg> <lb/>
and punctual performance of his will. One whose <lb/>
character was squared, with mathematical exactness, to his <lb/>
situation. Helena, with all her faults, did not merit to be <lb/>
regarded in this light. Her introduction would destroy the <lb/>
harmony of his scheme, and be, with respect to herself, a <lb/>
genuine debasement. A genuine evil would thus be <reg orig="sub-|stituted">substituted</reg> <lb/>
for one that was purely imaginary.</p>
<p>Helena's intellectual deficiencies could not be concealed. <lb/>
She was a proficient in the elements of no science. The <lb/>
doctrine of lines and surfaces was as disproportionate with <lb/>
her intellects as with those of the mock-bird. She had not <lb/>
reasoned on the principles of human action, nor examined <lb/>
the structure of society. She was ignorant of the past or <lb/>
present condition of mankind. History had not informed <lb/>
her of the one, nor the narratives of voyages, nor the <reg orig="deduc-|tions">deductions</reg> <lb/>
of geography of the other. The heights of eloquence <lb/>
and poetry were shut out from her view. She could not <lb/>
commune in their native dialect, with the sages of Rome <lb/>
and Athens. To her those perennial fountains of wisdom <lb/>
and refinement were sealed. The constitution of nature, <lb/>
the attributes of its author, the arrangement of the parts of <lb/>
the external universe, and the substance, modes of operation, <lb/>
and ultimate destiny of human intelligence, were enigmas <lb/>
unsolved and insoluble by her.</p>
<p>But this was not all. The superstructure could for the <lb/>
present be spared. Nay, it was desirable that the province <lb/>
of rearing it, should be reserved for him. All he wanted <lb/>
was a suitable foundation; but this Helena did not possess. <lb/>
He had not hitherto been able to create in her the inclination <lb/>
or the power. She had listened to his precepts with <reg orig="docil-|ity">docility</reg>. <lb/>
She had diligently conned the lessons which he had <lb/>
prescribed, but the impressions were as fleeting as if they <lb/>
had been made on water. Nature seemed to have set <reg orig="im-|passible">impassible</reg> <lb/>
limits to her attainments.</p>
<p>This indeed was an unwelcome belief. He struggled to <lb/>
invalidate it. He reflected on the immaturity of her age. <lb/>
What but crude and hasty views was it reasonable to expect <lb/>
at so early a period. If her mind had not been awakened, <lb/>
<pb n="114" entity="eaf033v5_0127" pid="uva-lib:350393"/>
it had proceeded, perhaps, from the injudiciousness of his <lb/>
plans, or merely from their not having been persisted in. <lb/>
What was wanting but the ornaments of mind to render <lb/>
this being all that poets have feigned of angelic nature. <lb/>
When he indulged himself in imaging the union of capacious <lb/>
understanding with her personal loveliness, his conceptions <lb/>
swelled to a pitch of enthusiasm, and it seemed as if no labor <lb/>
was too great to be employed in the production of such a <lb/>
creature. And yet, in the midst of his glowings, he would <lb/>
sink into sudden dejection at the recollection of that which <lb/>
passion had, for a time, excluded. To make her wise it <lb/>
would be requisite to change her sex. He had forgotten <lb/>
that his pupil was a female, and her capacity therefore <reg orig="limit-|ed">limited</reg> <lb/>
by nature. This mortifying thought was outbalanced by <lb/>
another. Her attainments, indeed, were suitable to the <reg orig="im-|becility">imbecility</reg> <lb/>
of her sex; but did she not surpass, in those <reg orig="attain-|ments">attainments</reg>, <lb/>
the ordinary rate of women? They must not be <lb/>
condemned, because they are outshone by qualities that are <lb/>
necessarily male births.</p>
<p>Her accomplishments formed a much more attractive <lb/>
theme. He overlooked no article in the catalogue. He <lb/>
was confounded at one time, and encouraged at another, on <lb/>
remarking the contradictions that seemed to be included in <lb/>
her character. It was difficult to conceive the impossibility <lb/>
of passing that barrier which yet she was able to touch. <lb/>
She was no poet. She listened to the rehearsal, without <lb/>
emotion, or was moved, not by the substance of the passage, <lb/>
by the dazzling image or the magic sympathy, but by <reg orig="some-|thing">something</reg> <lb/>
adscititious; yet usher her upon the stage, and no poet <lb/>
would wish for a more powerful organ of his conceptions. <lb/>
In assuming this office, she appeared to have drank in the <lb/>
very soul of the dramatist. What was wanting in judgment, <lb/>
was supplied by memory, in the tenaciousness of which, she <lb/>
has seldom been rivalled.</p>
<p>Her sentiments were trite and undigested, but were <reg orig="deco-|rated">decorated</reg> <lb/>
with all the fluences and melodies of elocution. Her <lb/>
musical instructer had been a Sicilian, who had formed her <lb/>
style after the Italian model. This man had likewise taught <lb/>
her his own language. He had supplied her chiefly with <lb/>
Sicilian compositions, both in poetry and melody, and was <lb/>
<pb n="115" entity="eaf033v5_0128" pid="uva-lib:350394"/>
content to be unclassical, for the sake of the feminine and <lb/>
voluptuous graces of his native dialect.</p>
<p>Ormond was an accurate judge of the proficiency of <reg orig="Hel-|ena">Helena</reg>, <lb/>
and of the felicity with which these accomplishments <lb/>
were suited to her character. When his pupil personated the <lb/>
victims of anger and grief, and poured forth the fiery <reg orig="indig-|nation">indignation</reg> <lb/>
of Calista, or the maternal despair of Constance, or <lb/>
the self-contentions of Ipsipile, he could not deny the <reg orig="hom-|age">homage</reg> <lb/>
which her talents might claim.</p>
<p>Her Sicilian tutor had found her no less tractable as a <reg orig="vo-|tary">votary</reg> <lb/>
of painting. She needed only the education of <reg orig="Angeli-|ca">Angelica</reg>, <lb/>
to exercise as potent and prolific a pencil. This was <reg orig="in-|compatible">incompatible</reg> <lb/>
with her condition, which limited her attainments <lb/>
to the elements of this art. It was otherwise with music. <lb/>
Here there was no obstacle to skill, and here the assiduities <lb/>
of many years, in addition to a prompt and ardent genius, set <lb/>
her beyond the hopes of rivalship.</p>
<p>Ormond had often amused his fancy with calling up <reg orig="im-|ages">images</reg> <lb/>
of excellence in this art. He saw no bounds to the <reg orig="in-|fluence">influence</reg> <lb/>
of habit, in augmenting the speed and multiplying <lb/>
the divisions of muscular motion. The fingers, by their <lb/>
form and size, were qualified to outrun and elude the most <lb/>
vigilant eye. The sensibility of keys and wires had limits, <lb/>
but these limits depended on the structure of the instrument, <lb/>
and the perfection of its structure was proportioned to the <lb/>
skill of the artist. On well constructed keys and strings, <lb/>
was it possible to carry diversities of movement and pressure <lb/>
too far. How far they could be carried was mere theme of <lb/>
conjecture, until it was his fate to listen to the magical <reg orig="per-|formances">performances</reg> <lb/>
of Helena, whose volant finger seemed to be <reg orig="self-|impelled">self-impelled</reg>. <lb/>
Her touches were creative of a thousand forms <lb/>
of <hi rend="italic">piano,</hi> and of numberless transitions from grave to quick, <lb/>
perceptible only to ears like her own.</p>
<p>In the selection and arrangement of notes, there are no <lb/>
limits to luxuriance and celerity. Helena had long <reg orig="relin-|quished">relinquished</reg> <lb/>
the drudgery of imitation. She never played but <lb/>
when there were motives to fervor, and when she was likely <lb/>
to ascend without impediment, and to maintain for a suitable <lb/>
period her elevation, to the element of new ideas. The <lb/>
lyrics of Milton and of Metastasio, she sung with <reg orig="accompani-|ments">accompaniments</reg> <lb/>
that never tired, because they were never repeated. <lb/>
<pb n="116" entity="eaf033v5_0129" pid="uva-lib:350395"/>
Her harp and clavichord supplied her with endless <reg orig="combina-|tions">combinations</reg>, <lb/>
and these in the opinion of Ormond were not inferior <lb/>
to the happiest exertions of Handel and Arne.</p>
<p>Chess was his favorite amusement. This was the only <lb/>
game which he allowed himself to play. He had studied it <lb/>
with so much zeal and success, that there were few with <lb/>
whom he deigned to contend. He was prone to consider it <lb/>
as a sort of criterion of human capacity. He who had <reg orig="ac-|quired">acquired</reg> <lb/>
skill in this <hi rend="italic">science,</hi> could not be infirm in mind; and <lb/>
yet he found in Helena, a competitor not unworthy of all his <lb/>
energies. Many hours were consumed in this employment, <lb/>
and here the lady was sedate, considerate, extensive in <reg orig="fore-|sight">foresight</reg>, <lb/>
and fertile in expedients.</p>
<p>Her deportment was graceful, in as much as it flowed <lb/>
from a consciousness of her defects. She was devoid of <reg orig="ar-|rogance">arrogance</reg> <lb/>
and vanity, neither imagining herself better than <lb/>
she was, and setting light by those qualifications which she <lb/>
unquestionably possessed. Such was the mixed character <lb/>
of this woman.</p>
<p>Ormond was occupied with schemes of a rugged and <reg orig="ar-|duous">arduous</reg> <lb/>
nature. His intimate associates and the partakers of <lb/>
his confidence, were imbued with the same zeal, and <reg orig="ar-|dent">ardent</reg> <lb/>
in the same pursuits. Helena could lay no claim to be <lb/>
exalted to this rank. That one destitute of this claim should <lb/>
enjoy the privileges of his wife, was still a supposition truly <lb/>
monstrous. Yet the image of Helena, fondly loving him, <lb/>
and a model as he conceived of tenderness and constancy, <lb/>
devoured by secret remorse, and pursued by the scorn of <lb/>
mankind; a mark for slander to shoot at, and an outcast of <lb/>
society, did not visit his meditations in vain. The rigor of <lb/>
his principles began now to relent.</p>
<p>He considered that various occupations are incident to <lb/>
every man. He cannot be invariably employed in the <reg orig="pro-|motion">promotion</reg> <lb/>
of one purpose. He must occasionally unbend, if <lb/>
he desires that the springs of his mind should retain their <lb/>
due vigor. Suppose his life were divided between business <lb/>
and amusement. This was a necessary distribution, and <lb/>
sufficiently congenial with his temper. It became him to <reg orig="se-|lect">select</reg> <lb/>
with skill his sources of amusement. It is true that <lb/>
Helena was unable to participate in his graver occupations; <lb/>
what then? In whom were blended so many pleasurable <lb/>
<pb n="117" entity="eaf033v5_0130" pid="uva-lib:350396"/>
attributes? In her were assembled an exquisite and <reg orig="deli-|cious">delicious</reg> <lb/>
variety. As it was, he was daily in her company. <lb/>
He should scarcely be more so, if marriage should take <lb/>
place. In that case, no change in their mode of life would <lb/>
be necessary. There was no need of dwelling under the <lb/>
same roof. His revenue was equal to the support of many <lb/>
household establishments. His personal independence would <lb/>
remain equally inviolable. No time, he thought, would <reg orig="di-|minish">diminish</reg> <lb/>
his influence over the mind of Helena, and it was not <lb/>
to be forgotten that the transition would to her be happy. It <lb/>
would reinstate her in the esteem of the world, and dispel <lb/>
those phantoms of remorse and shame by which she was at <lb/>
present persecuted.</p>
<p>These were plausible considerations. They tended at <lb/>
least to shake his resolutions. Time would probably have <lb/>
completed the conquest of his pride, had not a new incident <lb/>
set the question in a new light.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XIV.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> narrative of Melbourne made a deeper impression <lb/>
on the mind of his guest than was at first apparent. This <lb/>
man's conduct was directed by the present impulse, and <lb/>
however elaborate his abstract notions, he seldom stopped to <lb/>
settle the agreement between his principles and actions. The <lb/>
use of money was a science like every other branch of <reg orig="be-|nevolence">benevolence</reg>, <lb/>
not reducible to any fixed principles. No man, <lb/>
in the disbursement of money, could say whether he was <lb/>
conferring a benefit or injury. The visible and immediate <lb/>
effects might be good, but evil was its ultimate and general <lb/>
tendency. To be governed by a view to the present rather <lb/>
than the future, was a human infirmity from which he did <lb/>
not pretend to be exempt. This, though an insufficient <lb/>
apology for the conduct of a rational being, was suitable to <lb/>
his indolence, and he was content in all cases to employ it. <lb/>
It was thus that he reconciled himself to beneficent acts, <lb/>
and humorously held himself up as an object of censure, on <lb/>
occasions when most entitled to applause.</p>
<p>He easily procured information as to the character and <lb/>
<pb n="118" entity="eaf033v5_0131" pid="uva-lib:350397"/>
situation of the Dudleys. Neighbors are always inquisitive, <lb/>
and happily, in this case, were enabled to make no <reg orig="unfavor-|able">unfavorable</reg> <lb/>
report. He resolved, without hesitation, to supply their <lb/>
wants. This he performed in a manner truly characteristic. <lb/>
There was a method of gaining access to families, and <reg orig="mark-|ing">marking</reg> <lb/>
them in their unguarded attitudes more easy and <reg orig="effec-|tual">effectual</reg> <lb/>
than any other; it required least preparation and cost <lb/>
least pains; the disguise, also, was of the most impenetrable <lb/>
kind. He had served a sort of occasional apprenticeship to <lb/>
the art, and executed its functions with perfect ease. It was <lb/>
the most entire and grotesque metamorphosis imaginable. It <lb/>
was stepping from the highest to the lowest rank in society, <lb/>
and shifting himself into a form, as remote from his own, as <lb/>
those recorded by Ovid. In a word, it was sometimes his <lb/>
practice to exchange his complexion and habiliments for <lb/>
those of a negro and a chimney-sweep, and to call at certain <lb/>
doors for employment. This he generally secured by <reg orig="im-|portunities">importunities</reg>, <lb/>
and the cheapness of his services.</p>
<p>When the loftiness of his port, and the punctiliousness <lb/>
of his nicety were considered, we should never have believed, <lb/>
what yet could be truly asserted, that he had frequently <lb/>
swept his own chimneys, without the knowledge of his own <lb/>
servants.<ref target="n3" n="1">*</ref>
<note id="n3" place="foot" n="1"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>Similar exploits are related of Count de La Lippe and Wortley <lb/>
Montague.</p></note>
 It was likewise true, though equally incredible, <lb/>
that he had played at romps with his scullion, and listened <lb/>
with patience to a thousand slanders on his own character.</p>
<p>In this disguise he visited the house of Mr. Dudley. It <lb/>
was nine o'clock in the morning. He remarked, with <reg orig="criti-|cal">critical</reg> <lb/>
eyes, the minutest circumstance in the appearance and <lb/>
demeanor of his customers, and glanced curiously at the <lb/>
house and furniture. Every thing was new and every thing <lb/>
pleased. The walls, though broken into roughness, by <reg orig="care-|lessness">carelessness</reg> <lb/>
or time, were adorned with glistening white. The <lb/>
floor, though loose and uneven, and with gaping seams, had <lb/>
received all the improvements which cloth and brush could <lb/>
give. The pine tables, rush chairs, and uncurtained bed, <lb/>
had been purchased at half price, at vendue, and exhibited <lb/>
various tokens of decay, but care, and neatness, and order <lb/>
were displayed in their condition and arrangement.</p>
<pb n="119" entity="eaf033v5_0132" pid="uva-lib:350398"/>
<p>The lower appartment was the eating and sitting room. <lb/>
It was likewise Mr. Dudley's bed-chamber. The upper <lb/>
room was occupied by Constantia and her Lucy. Ormond <lb/>
viewed every thing with the accuracy of an artist, and <reg orig="car-|ried">carried</reg> <lb/>
away with him a catalogue of every thing visible. The <lb/>
faded form of Mr. Dudley that still retained its dignity, the <lb/>
sedateness, graceful condescension and personal elegance <lb/>
of Constantia, were new to the apprehension of Ormond. <lb/>
The contrast between the house and its inhabitants, <reg orig="render-|ed">rendered</reg> <lb/>
the appearance more striking. When he had finished <lb/>
his task, he retired, but returning in a quarter of an hour, <lb/>
he presented a letter to the young lady. He behaved as if <lb/>
by no means desirous of eluding her interrogatories, and <lb/>
when she desired him to stay, readily complied. The letter, <lb/>
unsigned and unsuperscribed, was to this effect.</p>
<p>"The writer of this is acquainted with the transaction <reg orig="be-|tween">between</reg> <lb/>
Thomas Craig and Mr. Dudley. The former is <reg orig="debt-|or">debtor</reg> <lb/>
to Mr. Dudley in a large sum. I have undertaken to pay <lb/>
as much of this debt, and at such times as suits my <reg orig="conve-|nience">convenience</reg>. <lb/>
I have had pecuniary engagements with Craig. I <lb/>
hold myself, in the sum inclosed, discharging so much of his <lb/>
debt. The future payments are uncertain, but I hope they <lb/>
will contribute to relieve the necessities of Mr. Dudley."</p>
<p>Ormond had calculated the amount of what would be <lb/>
necessary for the annual subsistence of this family, on the <lb/>
present frugal plan. He had regulated his disbursements <lb/>
accordingly.</p>
<p>It was natural to feel curiosity as to the writer of this <reg orig="epis-|tle">epistle</reg>. <lb/>
The bearer displayed a prompt and talkative <reg orig="disposi-|tion">disposition</reg>. <lb/>
He had a staring eye and a grin of vivacity forever <lb/>
at command. When questioned by Constantia, he <reg orig="answer-|ed">answered</reg> <lb/>
that the gentleman had forbidden him to mention his name <lb/>
or the place where he lived. Had he ever met with the <lb/>
same person before? O yes. He had lived with him <lb/>
from a child. His mother lived with him still and his brothers. <lb/>
His master had nothing for him to do at home, so he sent <lb/>
him out sweeping chimneys, taking from him only half the <lb/>
money that he earned, that way. He was a very good <lb/>
master.</p>
<p>Then the gentleman had been a long time in the city?</p>
<p>O yes. All his life he reckoned. He used to live in <reg orig="Wal-|nut">Walnut</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="120" entity="eaf033v5_0133" pid="uva-lib:350399"/>
Street, but now he 's moved down town. Here he <lb/>
checked himself, and added, but I forgets. I must not tell <lb/>
where he lives. He told me I must'nt.</p>
<p>He has a family and children, I suppose?</p>
<p>O yes. Why don't you know Miss Hetty and Miss <reg orig="Bet-|sey&mdash;there">Betsey&mdash;there</reg> <lb/>
again. I was going to tell the name, that he <lb/>
said I must not tell.</p>
<p>Constantia saw that the secret might be easily <reg orig="discover-|ed">discovered</reg>, <lb/>
but she forbore. She disdained to take advantage of <lb/>
this messenger's imagined simplicity. She dismissed him <lb/>
with some small addition to his demand, and with a promise <lb/>
always to employ him in this way.</p>
<p>By this mode, Ormond had effectually concealed himself. <lb/>
The lady's conjectures, founded on this delusive <reg orig="informa-|tion">information</reg>, <lb/>
necessarily wandered widely from the truth. The <reg orig="ob-|servations">observations</reg> <lb/>
that he had made during this visit afforded his <lb/>
mind considerable employment. The manner in which this <lb/>
lady had sustained so cruel a reverse of fortune, the <reg orig="cheer-|fulness">cheerfulness</reg> <lb/>
with which she appeared to forego all the <reg orig="gratifica-|tions">gratifications</reg> <lb/>
of affluence; the skill with which she selected her path <lb/>
of humble industry, and the steadiness with which she <reg orig="pur-|sued">pursued</reg> <lb/>
it, were proofs of a moral constitution, from which he <lb/>
supposed the female sex to be debarred. The comparison <lb/>
was obvious between Constantia and Helena, and the result <lb/>
was by no means advantageous to the latter. Was it <reg orig="possi-|ble">possible</reg> <lb/>
that such a one descended to the level of her father's <lb/>
apprentice? That she sacrificed her honor to a wretch <lb/>
like that? This reflection tended to repress the inclination <lb/>
he would otherwise have felt for cultivating her society, but <lb/>
it did not indispose him to benefit her in a certain way.</p>
<p>On his next visit to his "bella Siciliana," as he called her, <lb/>
he questioned her as to the need in which she might stand <lb/>
of the services of a seamstress, and being informed that <lb/>
they were sometimes wanted, he recommended Miss Acworth <lb/>
to her patronage. He said that he had heard her spoken <lb/>
of in favorable terms, by the gossips at Melbourne's. They <lb/>
represented her as a good girl, slenderly provided for, and <lb/>
he wished that Helena would prefer her to all others.</p>
<p>His recommendation was sufficient. The wishes of <reg orig="Or-|mond">Ormond</reg>, <lb/>
as soon as they became known, became hers. Her <lb/>
temper made her always diligent in search of novelty. It <lb/>
<pb n="121" entity="eaf033v5_0134" pid="uva-lib:350400"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">11</fw></pb>
was easy to make work for the needle. In short she <reg orig="re-|solved">resolved</reg> <lb/>
to send for her the next day. The interview <reg orig="accord-|ingly">accordingly</reg> <lb/>
took place on the ensuing morning, not without <reg orig="mu-|tual">mutual</reg> <lb/>
surprise, and, on the part of the fair Sicilian, not <reg orig="with-|out">without</reg> <lb/>
considerable embarrassment.</p>
<p>This circumstance arose from their having changed their <lb/>
respective names, though from motives of a very different <lb/>
kind. They were not strangers to each other, though no <lb/>
intimacy had ever subsisted between them. Each was <lb/>
merely acquainted with the name, person, and general <lb/>
character of the other. No circumstance in Constantia's <lb/>
situation tended to embarrass her. Her mind had attained <lb/>
a state of serene composure, incapable of being ruffled by <lb/>
an incident of this kind. She merely derived pleasure <lb/>
from the sight of her old acquaintance. The aspect of <lb/>
things around her was splendid and gay. She seemed the <lb/>
mistress of the mansion, and her name was changed. Hence <lb/>
it was unavoidable to conclude that she was married.</p>
<p>Helena was conscious that appearances were calculated <lb/>
to suggest this conclusion. The idea was a painful one. <lb/>
She sorrowed to think that this conclusion was fallacious. <lb/>
The consciousness that her true condition was unknown to <lb/>
her visitant, and the ignominiousness of that truth, gave an <lb/>
air of constraint to her behavior, which Constantia ascribed <lb/>
to a principle of delicacy.</p>
<p>In the midst of reflections relative to herself, she <reg orig="admit-|ted">admitted</reg> <lb/>
some share of surprise at the discovery of Constantia, <lb/>
in a situation so inferior to that in which she had formerly <lb/>
known her. She had heard, in general terms, of the <reg orig="mis-|fortunes">misfortunes</reg> <lb/>
of Mr. Dudley, but was unacquainted with <reg orig="particu-|lars">particulars</reg>; <lb/>
but this surprise, and the difficulty of adapting her <lb/>
behavior to circumstances, was only in part the source of <lb/>
her embarrassment, though by her companion it was wholly <lb/>
attributed to this cause. Constantia thought it her duty to <lb/>
remove it by open and unaffected manners. She therefore <lb/>
said, in a sedate and cheerful tone, you see me, madam, in <lb/>
a situation somewhat unlike that in which I formerly was <lb/>
placed. You will probably regard the change as an <reg orig="un-|happy">unhappy</reg> <lb/>
one, but I assure you, I have found it far less so <lb/>
than I expected. I am thus reduced not by my own fault. <lb/>
<pb n="122" entity="eaf033v5_0135" pid="uva-lib:350401"/>
It is this reflection that enables me to conform to it without <lb/>
a murmur. I shall rejoice to know that Mrs. Eden is as <lb/>
happy as I am.</p>
<p>Helena was pleased with this address, and returned an <lb/>
answer full of sweetness. She had not, in her compassion <lb/>
for the fallen, a particle of pride. She thought of nothing <lb/>
but the contrast between the former situation of her visitant <lb/>
and the present. The fame of her great qualities had <lb/>
formerly excited veneration, and that reverence was by no <lb/>
means diminished by a nearer scrutiny. The consciousness <lb/>
of her own frailty, meanwhile, diffused over the behavior of <lb/>
Helena, a timidity and dubiousness uncommonly fascinating. <lb/>
She solicited Constantia's friendship in a manner that shewed <lb/>
she was afraid of nothing but denial. An assent was eagerly <lb/>
given, and thenceforth a cordial intercourse was established <lb/>
between them.</p>
<p>The real situation of Helena was easily discovered. The <lb/>
officious person who communicated this information, at the <lb/>
same time cautioned Constantia against associating with one <lb/>
of tainted reputation. This information threw some light <lb/>
upon appearances. It accounted for that melancholy which <lb/>
Helena was unable to conceal. It explained that solitude <lb/>
in which she lived, and which Constantia had ascribed to the <lb/>
death or absence of her husband. It justified the solicitous <lb/>
silence she had hitherto maintained respecting her own <lb/>
affairs, and which her friend's good sense forbade her to <reg orig="em-|ploy">employ</reg> <lb/>
any sinister means of eluding.</p>
<p>No long time was necessary to make her mistress of <lb/>
Helena's character. She loved her with uncommon warmth, <lb/>
though by no means blind to her defects. She formed no <lb/>
expectations, from the knowledge of her character, to which <lb/>
this intelligence operated as a disappointment. It merely <lb/>
excited her pity, and made her thoughtful how she might <lb/>
assist her in repairing this deplorable error.</p>
<p>This design was of no ordinary magnitude. She saw <lb/>
that it was previously necessary to obtain the confidence of <lb/>
Helena. This was a task of easy performance. She knew <lb/>
the purity of her own motives and the extent of her powers, <lb/>
and embarked in this undertaking with full confidence of <lb/>
success. She had only to profit by a private interview, to <lb/>
acquaint her friend with what she knew, to solicit a <reg orig="com-|plete">complete</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="123" entity="eaf033v5_0136" pid="uva-lib:350402"/>
and satisfactory disclosure, to explain the impressions <lb/>
which her intelligence produced, and to offer her <reg orig="disinterest-|ed">disinterested</reg> <lb/>
advice. No one knew better how to couch her ideas in <lb/>
words, suitable to the end proposed by her in imparting <lb/>
them.</p>
<p>Helena was at first terrified, but the benevolence of her <lb/>
friend quickly entitled her to confidence and gratitude that <lb/>
knew no limits. She had been deterred from unveiling her <lb/>
heart by the fear of exciting contempt or abhorrence; but <lb/>
when she found that all due allowances were made, that her <lb/>
conduct was treated as erroneous in no atrocious or <reg orig="inexpia-|ble">inexpiable</reg> <lb/>
degree, and as far from being insusceptible of remedy; <lb/>
that the obloquy with which she had been treated, found no <lb/>
vindicator or participator in her friend, her heart was <reg orig="con-|siderably">considerably</reg> <lb/>
relieved. She had been long a stranger to the <lb/>
sympathy and intercourse of her own sex. Now, this good, <lb/>
in its most precious form, was conferred upon her, and she <lb/>
experienced an increase, rather than diminution of <reg orig="tender-|ness">tenderness</reg>, <lb/>
in consequence of her true situation being known.</p>
<p>She made no secret of any part of her history. She <lb/>
did full justice to the integrity of her lover, and explained <lb/>
the unforced conditions on which she had consented to live <lb/>
with him. This relation exhibited the character of Ormond <lb/>
in a very uncommon light. His asperities wounded, and <lb/>
his sternness chilled. What unauthorized conceptions of <lb/>
matrimonial and political equality did he entertain! He <lb/>
had fashioned his treatment of Helena on sullen and <reg orig="fero-|cious">ferocious</reg> <lb/>
principles. Yet he was able, it seemed, to mould her, <lb/>
by means of them, nearly into the creature that he wished. <lb/>
She knew too little of the man justly to estimate his <reg orig="cha-|racter">character</reg>. <lb/>
It remained to be ascertained whether his purposes <lb/>
were consistent and upright, or were those of a villain <lb/>
and betrayer.</p>
<p>Meanwhile what was to be done by Helena? Marriage <lb/>
had been refused on plausible pretences. Her <reg orig="unenlighten-|ed">unenlightened</reg> <lb/>
understanding made her no match for her lover. She <lb/>
would never maintain her claim to nuptial privileges in his <lb/>
presence, or if she did, she would never convince him of <lb/>
their validity.</p>
<p>Were they indeed valid? Was not the disparity between <lb/>
them incurable? A marriage of minds so dissimilar could <lb/>
<pb n="124" entity="eaf033v5_0137" pid="uva-lib:350403"/>
only be productive of misery immediately to him, and by a <lb/>
reflex operation, to herself. She could not be happy in a <lb/>
union that was the source of regret to her husband. <reg orig="Mar-|riage">Marriage</reg> <lb/>
therefore was not possible, or if possible, was not, <lb/>
perhaps, to be wished. But what was the choice that <reg orig="re-|mained">remained</reg>?</p>
<p>To continue in her present situation was not to be endured. <lb/>
Disgrace was a d&aelig;mon that would blast every hope of <reg orig="hap-|piness">happiness</reg>. <lb/>
She was excluded from all society but that of the <lb/>
depraved. Her situation was eminently critical. It <reg orig="de-|pended">depended</reg>, <lb/>
perhaps, on the resolution she should now form <lb/>
whether she should be enrolled among the worst of mankind. <lb/>
Infamy is the worst of evils. It creates innumerable <reg orig="obstruc-|tions">obstructions</reg> <lb/>
in the path of virtue. It manacles the hand, and <reg orig="en-|tangles">entangles</reg> <lb/>
the feet that are active only to good. To the weak <lb/>
it is an evil of much greater magnitude. It determines <lb/>
their destiny, and they hasten to merit that reproach, which, <lb/>
at first it may be, they did not deserve.</p>
<p>This connexion is intrinsically flagitious. Helena is <reg orig="sub-|jected">subjected</reg> <lb/>
by it to the worst ills that are incident to humanity, <lb/>
the general contempt of mankind, and the reproaches of her <lb/>
own conscience. From these, there is but one method from <lb/>
which she can hope to be relieved. The intercourse must <lb/>
cease.</p>
<p>It was easier to see the propriety of separation, than to <lb/>
project means for accomplishing it. It was true that Helena <lb/>
loved; but what quarter was due to this passion when <lb/>
divorced from integrity? Is it not in every bosom a <reg orig="per-|ishable">perishable</reg> <lb/>
sentiment? Whatever be her warmth, absence will <lb/>
congeal it. Place her in new scenes, and supply her with <lb/>
new associates. Her accomplishments will not fail to attract <lb/>
votaries. From these she may select a conjugal companion <lb/>
suitable to her mediocrity of talents.</p>
<p>But alas! What power on earth can prevail on her to <lb/>
renounce Ormond? Others may justly entertain this <reg orig="pros-|pect">prospect</reg>, <lb/>
but it must be invisible to her. Besides, is it <reg orig="abso-|lutely">absolutely</reg> <lb/>
certain that either her peace of mind or her <reg orig="reputa-|tion">reputation</reg> <lb/>
will be restored by this means? In the opinion of the <lb/>
world her offences cannot, by any perseverance in penitence, <lb/>
be expiated. She will never believe that separation will <lb/>
exterminate her passion. Certain it is, that it will avail <lb/>
<pb n="125" entity="eaf033v5_0138" pid="uva-lib:350404"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">11*</fw></pb>
nothing to the re-establishment of her fame. But if it were <lb/>
conducive to these ends, how chimerical to suppose that she <lb/>
will ever voluntarily adopt it? If Ormond refuse his <reg orig="con-|currence">concurrence</reg>, <lb/>
there is absolutely an end to hope. And what <lb/>
power on earth is able to sway his determinations? At <lb/>
least what influence was it possible for her to obtain over <lb/>
them?</p>
<p>Should they separate, whither should she retire? What <lb/>
mode of subsistence should she adopt? She has never <lb/>
been accustomed to think beyond the day. She has eaten <lb/>
and drank, but another has provided the means. She <lb/>
scarcely comprehends the principle that governs the world, <lb/>
and in consequence of which, nothing can be gained but by <lb/>
giving something in exchange for it. She is ignorant and <lb/>
helpless as a child, on every topic that relates to the <reg orig="pro-|curing">procuring</reg> <lb/>
of subsistence. Her education has disabled her <lb/>
from standing alone.</p>
<p>But this was not all. She must not only be supplied by <lb/>
others, but sustained in the enjoyment of a luxurious <reg orig="ex-|istence">existence</reg>. <lb/>
Would you bereave her of the gratifications of <lb/>
opulence? You had better take away her life. Nay, it <lb/>
would ultimately amount to this. She can live but in one <lb/>
way.</p>
<p>At present she is lovely, and, to a certain degree, innocent, <lb/>
but expose her to the urgencies and temptations of want, <lb/>
let personal pollution be the price set upon the voluptuous <lb/>
affluences of her present condition, and it is to be feared <lb/>
there is nothing in the contexture of her mind to hinder her <lb/>
from making the purchase. In every respect therefore the <lb/>
prospect was a hopeless one. So hopeless that her mind <lb/>
insensibly returned to the question which she had at first <lb/>
dismissed with very slight examination, the question relative <lb/>
to the advantages and probabilities of marriage. A more <lb/>
accurate review convinced her that this was the most eligible <lb/>
alternative. It was, likewise, most easily effected. The <lb/>
lady, of course, would be its fervent advocate. There did <lb/>
not want reasons why Ormond should finally embrace it. In <lb/>
what manner appeals to his reason or his passion might most <lb/>
effectually be made, she knew not.</p>
<p>Helena was illy qualified to be her own advocate. Her <lb/>
<pb n="126" entity="eaf033v5_0139" pid="uva-lib:350405"/>
unhappiness could not but be visible to Ormond. He had <lb/>
shewn himself attentive and affectionate. Was it impossible <lb/>
that, in time, he should reason himself into a spontaneous <lb/>
adoption of this scheme? This, indeed, was a slender <reg orig="foun-|dation">foundation</reg> <lb/>
for hope, but there was no other on which she could <lb/>
build.</p>
<p>Such were the meditations of Constantia on this topic. <lb/>
She was deeply solicitous for the happiness of her friend. <lb/>
They spent much of their time together. The consolations <lb/>
of her society were earnestly sought by Helena, but to <reg orig="en-|joy">enjoy</reg> <lb/>
them, she was for the most part obliged to visit the <lb/>
former at her own dwelling. For this arrangement, <reg orig="Con-|stantia">Constantia</reg> <lb/>
apologized by saying, you will pardon my requesting <lb/>
you to favor me with your visits, rather than allowing you <lb/>
mine. Every thing is airy and brilliant within these walls. <lb/>
There is, besides, an air of seclusion and security about you <lb/>
that is delightful. In comparison, my dwelling is bleak, <lb/>
comfortless, and unretired, but my father is entitled to all <lb/>
my care. His infirmity prevents him from amusing himself, <lb/>
and his heart is cheered by the mere sound of my voice, <lb/>
though not addressed to him. The mere belief of my <lb/>
presence seems to operate as an antidote to the dreariness <lb/>
of solitude; and now you know my motives, I am sure you <lb/>
will not only forgive but approve of my request.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XV.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">When</hi> once the subject had been introduced, Helena <lb/>
was prone to descant upon her own situation, and listened <lb/>
with deference to the remarks and admonitions of her <reg orig="com-|panion">companion</reg>. <lb/>
Constantia did not conceal from her any of her <lb/>
sentiments. She enabled her to view her own condition in <lb/>
its true light, and set before her the indispensable advantages <lb/>
of marriage, while she, at the same time, afforded her the <lb/>
best directions as to the conduct she ought to pursue in <lb/>
order to effect her purpose.</p>
<p>The mind of Helena was thus kept in a state of <reg orig="per-|petual">perpetual</reg> <lb/>
and uneasy fluctuation. While absent from Ormond, <lb/>
<pb n="127" entity="eaf033v5_0140" pid="uva-lib:350406"/>
or listening to her friend's remonstrances, the deplorableness <lb/>
of her condition, arose in its most disastrous hues, before her <lb/>
imagination. But the spectre seldom failed to vanish at the <lb/>
approach of Ormond. His voice dissipated every inquietude.</p>
<p>She was not insensible of this inconstancy. She <reg orig="per-|ceived">perceived</reg> <lb/>
and lamented her own weakness. She was destitute <lb/>
of all confidence in her own exertions. She could not be <lb/>
in the perpetual enjoyment of his company. Her intervals <lb/>
of tranquillity therefore were short, while those of anxiety <lb/>
and dejection were insupportably tedious. She revered, but <lb/>
believed herself incapable to emulate the magnanimity of her <lb/>
monitor. The consciousness of inferiority, especially in a <lb/>
case like this, in which her happiness so much depended on <lb/>
her own exertions, excited in her the most humiliating <reg orig="sen-|sations">sensations</reg>.</p>
<p>While indulging in fruitless melancholy, the thought one <lb/>
day occurred to her, why may not Constantia be prevailed <lb/>
upon to plead my cause? Her capacity and courage are <lb/>
equal to any undertaking. The reasonings that are so <lb/>
powerful in my eyes, would they be trivial and futile in <lb/>
those of Ormond? I cannot have a more pathetic and <reg orig="dis-|interested">disinterested</reg> <lb/>
advocate.</p>
<p>This idea was cherished with uncommon ardor. She <lb/>
seized the first opportunity that offered itself to impart it to <lb/>
her friend. It was a wild and singular proposal and was <reg orig="re-|jected">rejected</reg> <lb/>
at the first glance. This scheme, so romantic and <lb/>
impracticable as it at first seemed, appeared to Helena in the <lb/>
most plausible colors. She could not bear to relinquish her <lb/>
new born hopes. She saw no valid objection to it. Every <lb/>
thing was easy to her friend, provided her sense of duty and <lb/>
her zeal could be awakened. The subject was frequently <lb/>
suggested to Constantia's reflections. Perceiving the <reg orig="san-|guineness">sanguineness</reg> <lb/>
of her friend's confidence, and fully impressed <lb/>
with the value of the end to be accomplished, she insensibly <lb/>
veered to the same opinion. At least, the scheme was <reg orig="wor-|thy">worthy</reg> <lb/>
of a candid discussion before it was rejected.</p>
<p>Ormond was a stranger to her. His manners were <reg orig="re-|pulsive">repulsive</reg> <lb/>
and austere. She was a mere girl. Her personal <lb/>
attachment to Helena was all that she could plead in excuse <lb/>
for taking part in her concerns. The subject was delicate. <lb/>
A blunt and irregular character like Ormond's, might throw <lb/>
<pb n="128" entity="eaf033v5_0141" pid="uva-lib:350407"/>
an air of ridicule over the scene. She shrunk from the <reg orig="en-|counter">encounter</reg> <lb/>
of a boisterous and manlike spirit.</p>
<p>But were not these scruples effeminate and puerile? Had <lb/>
she studied so long in the school of adversity, without <reg orig="con-|viction">conviction</reg> <lb/>
of the duty of a virtuous independence? Was she <lb/>
not a rational being, fully imbued with the justice of her <lb/>
cause? Was it not ignoble to refuse the province of a <reg orig="vin-|dicator">vindicator</reg> <lb/>
of the injured, before any tribunal, however <reg orig="tremen-|dous">tremendous</reg> <lb/>
or unjust? And who was Ormond, that his eye should <lb/>
inspire terror?</p>
<p>The father or brother of Helena might assume the office <lb/>
without indecorum. Nay, a mother or sister might not be <lb/>
debarred from it. Why then should she who was actuated <lb/>
by equal zeal, and was engaged, by ties stronger than <reg orig="con-|sanguinity">consanguinity</reg>, <lb/>
in the promotion of her friend's happiness. It is <lb/>
true she did not view the subject in the light in which it was <lb/>
commonly viewed by brothers and parents. It was not a <lb/>
gust of rage that should transport her into his presence. <lb/>
She did not go to awaken his slumbering conscience, and <lb/>
abash him in the pride of guilty triumph, but to rectify <reg orig="de-|liberate">deliberate</reg> <lb/>
errors and change his course by the change of his <lb/>
principles. It was her business to point out to him the road <lb/>
of duty and happiness, from which he had strayed with no <lb/>
sinister intentions. This was to be done without raving and <lb/>
fury, but with amicable soberness, and in the way of calm <lb/>
and rational remonstrance. Yet there were scruples that <lb/>
would not be shut out, and continually whispered her, What <lb/>
an office is this for a girl and a stranger to assume?</p>
<p>In what manner should it be performed? Should an <reg orig="in-|terview">interview</reg> <lb/>
be sought, and her ideas be explained without <reg orig="con-|fusion">confusion</reg> <lb/>
or faultering, undismayed by ludicrous airs or insolent <lb/>
frowns? But this was a point to be examined. Was <reg orig="Or-|mond">Ormond</reg> <lb/>
capable of such behaviour? If he were, it would be <lb/>
useless to attempt the reformation of his errors. Such a man <lb/>
is incurable and obdurate. Such a man is not to be sought as <lb/>
the husband of Helena; but this surely is a different being.</p>
<p>The medium through which she had viewed his character <lb/>
was an ample one, but might not be very accurate. The <lb/>
treatment which Helena had received from him, exclusive <lb/>
of his fundamental error, betokened a mind to which she did <lb/>
not disdain to be allied. In spite of his defects she saw <lb/>
<pb n="129" entity="eaf033v5_0142" pid="uva-lib:350408"/>
that their elements were more congenial, and the points of <lb/>
contact, between this person and herself, more numerous, <lb/>
than between her and Helena, whose voluptuous sweetness <lb/>
of temper and mediocrity of understanding, excited in her <lb/>
bosom no genuine sympathy.</p>
<p>Every thing is progressive in the human mind. When <lb/>
there is leisure to reflect, ideas will succeed each other in a <lb/>
long train, before the ultimate point be gained. The <reg orig="atten-|tion">attention</reg> <lb/>
must shift from one side to the other of a given question <lb/>
many times before it settles. Constantia did not form her <lb/>
resolutions in haste, but when once formed, they were exempt <lb/>
from fluctuation. She reflected before she acted, and <reg orig="there-|fore">therefore</reg> <lb/>
acted with consistency and vigor. She did not apprise <lb/>
her friend of her intention. She was willing that she should <lb/>
benefit by her interposition, before she knew it was employed.</p>
<p>She sent her Lucy with a note to Ormond's house. It <lb/>
was couched in these terms:</p>
<p>"Constantia Dudley requests an interview with Mr. <reg orig="Or-|mond">Ormond</reg>. <lb/>
Her business being of some moment, she wishes <lb/>
him to name an hour when most disengaged."</p>
<p>An answer was immediately returned, that at three o'clock, <lb/>
in the afternoon, he should be glad to see her.</p>
<p>This message produced no small surprise in Ormond. <lb/>
He had not withdrawn his notice from Constantia, and had <lb/>
marked, with curiosity and approbation, the progress of the <lb/>
connexion between the two women. The impressions which <lb/>
he had received from the report of Helena, were not <reg orig="dis-|similar">dissimilar</reg> <lb/>
to those which Constantia had imbibed, from the <lb/>
same quarter, respecting himself; but he gathered from them <lb/>
no suspicion of the purpose of a visit. He recollected his <lb/>
connexion with Craig. This lady had had an opportunity of <lb/>
knowing that some connexion subsisted between them. He <lb/>
concluded, that some information or inquiry respecting Craig, <lb/>
might occasion this event. As it was, it gave him <reg orig="considera-|ble">considerable</reg> <lb/>
satisfaction. It would enable him more closely to <reg orig="ex-|amine">examine</reg> <lb/>
one, with respect to whom he entertained great <reg orig="curi-|osity">curiosity</reg>.</p>
<p>Ormond's conjecture was partly right. Constantia did <lb/>
not forget her having traced Craig to this habitation. She <lb/>
designed to profit by the occasion, which this circumstance <lb/>
afforded her, of making some inquiry respecting Craig, in <lb/>
<pb n="130" entity="eaf033v5_0143" pid="uva-lib:350409"/>
order to introduce, by suitable degrees, a more important <lb/>
subject.</p>
<p>The appointed hour having arrived, he received her in his <lb/>
drawing-room. He knew what was due to his guest. He <lb/>
loved to mortify, by his negligence, the pride of his equals <lb/>
and superiors, but a lower class had nothing to fear from his <lb/>
insolence. Constantia took the seat that was offered to her, <lb/>
without speaking. She had made suitable preparations for <lb/>
this interview, and her composure was invincible. The <reg orig="man-|ners">manners</reg> <lb/>
of her host were by no means calculated to disconcert <lb/>
her. His air was conciliating and attentive.</p>
<p>She began with naming Craig, as one known to Ormond, <lb/>
and desired to be informed of his place of abode. She <lb/>
was proceeding to apologize for this request, by explaining <lb/>
in general terms, that her father's infirmities prevented him <lb/>
from acting for himself, that Craig was his debtor to a large <lb/>
amount, that he stood in need of all that justly belonged to <lb/>
him, and was in pursuit of some means for tracing Craig to <lb/>
his retreat. Ormond interrupted her, examining, at the <lb/>
same time, with a vigilance, somewhat too unsparing, the <reg orig="ef-|fects">effects</reg> <lb/>
which his words should produce upon her.</p>
<p>You may spare yourself the trouble of explaining. I am <lb/>
acquainted with the whole affair between Craig and your <lb/>
family. He has concealed from me nothing. I know <hi rend="italic">all</hi> <lb/>
that has passed between you.</p>
<p>In saying this, Ormond intended that his looks and <reg orig="empha-|sis">emphasis</reg> <lb/>
should convey his full meaning. In the style of her <reg orig="com-|ments">comments</reg> <lb/>
he saw none of those corroborating symptoms that <lb/>
he expected.</p>
<p>Indeed! He has been very liberal of his confidence. <lb/>
Confession is a token of penitence, but, alas! I fear he has <lb/>
deceived you. To be sincere was doubtless his true interest, <lb/>
but he is too much in the habit of judging superficially. If <lb/>
he has told you all, there is, indeed, no need of explanation. <lb/>
This visit is, in that case, sufficiently accounted for. Is it in <lb/>
your power, Sir, to inform us whither he has gone?</p>
<p>For what end should I tell you? I promise you you <lb/>
will not follow him. Take my word for it, he is totally <reg orig="un-|worthy">unworthy</reg> <lb/>
of you. Let the past be no precedent for the future. <lb/>
If you have not made that discovery yourself, I have made <lb/>
it for you. I expect, at least, to be thanked for my trouble.</p>
<pb n="131" entity="eaf033v5_0144" pid="uva-lib:350410"/>
<p>This speech was unintelligible to Constantia. Her looks <lb/>
betokened a perplexity unmingled with fear or shame.</p>
<p>It is my way, continued he, to say what I think. I care <lb/>
little for consequences. I have said that I know <hi rend="italic">all.</hi> This <lb/>
will excuse me for being perfectly explicit. That I am <reg orig="mis-|taken">mistaken</reg> <lb/>
is very possible; but I am inclined to place that matter <lb/>
beyond the reach of a doubt. Listen to me, and confirm <lb/>
me in the opinion I have already formed of your good sense, <lb/>
by viewing, in a just light, the unreservedness with which you <lb/>
are treated. I have something to tell, which, if you are <lb/>
wise, you will not be offended at my telling so roundly. <lb/>
On the contrary you will thank me, and perceive that my <lb/>
conduct is a proof of my respect for you. The person <lb/>
whom you met here is named Craig, but, as he tells me, is <lb/>
not the man you looked for. This man's brother, the <reg orig="part-|ner">partner</reg> <lb/>
of your father, and, as he assured me, your own <reg orig="accept-|ed">accepted</reg> <lb/>
and illicitly gratified lover, is dead.</p>
<p>These words were uttered without any extenuating <reg orig="hesi-|tation">hesitation</reg> <lb/>
or depression of tone. On the contrary, the most <lb/>
offensive terms were drawn out in the most deliberate and <lb/>
emphatic manner. Constantia's cheeks glowed and her eyes <lb/>
sparkled with indignation, but she forbore to interrupt. The <lb/>
looks with which she listened to the remainder of the speech, <lb/>
shewed that she fully comprehended the scene, and enabled <lb/>
him to comprehend it. He proceeded.</p>
<p>This man is a brother of that. Their resemblance in <lb/>
figure occasioned your mistake. Your father's debtor died, <lb/>
it seems, on his arrival at Jamaica. There he met with <lb/>
this brother, and bequeathed to him his property and papers. <lb/>
Some of these papers are in my possession. They are <lb/>
letters from Constantia Dudley, and are parts of an intrigue, <lb/>
which, considering the character of the man, was not much <lb/>
to her honor. Such was this man's narrative told to me <lb/>
some time before your meeting with him at this house. I <lb/>
have a right to judge in this affair, that is, I have a right to <lb/>
my opinion. If I mistake, and I half suspect myself, you <lb/>
are able, perhaps, to rectify my error, and in a case like this, <lb/>
doubtless you will not want the inclination.</p>
<p>Perhaps if the countenance of this man had not been <lb/>
characterised by the keenest intelligence, and a sort of careless <lb/>
and overflowing good will, this speech might have produced <lb/>
<pb n="132" entity="eaf033v5_0145" pid="uva-lib:350411"/>
different effects. She was prepared, though imperfectly, <lb/>
for entering into his character. He waited for an answer, <lb/>
which she gave without emotion.</p>
<p>You are deceived. I am sorry for your own sake, that you <lb/>
are. He must have had some end in view, in imposing these <lb/>
falsehoods upon you, which, perhaps, they have enabled <lb/>
him to accomplish. As to myself, this man can do me <lb/>
no injury. I willingly make you my judge. The letters <lb/>
you speak of will alone suffice to my vindication. They never <lb/>
were received from me, and are forgeries. That man always <lb/>
persisted till he made himself the dupe of his own artifices. <lb/>
That incident in his plot, on the introduction of which he <lb/>
probably the most applauded himself, will most powerfully <lb/>
operate to defeat it.</p>
<p>Those letters never were received from me, and are <reg orig="for-|geries">forgeries</reg>. <lb/>
His skill in imitation extended no farther in the <lb/>
present case, than my handwriting. My modes of thinking <lb/>
and expression were beyond the reach of his mimicry.</p>
<p>When she had finished, Ormond spent a moment in <reg orig="ru-|minating">ruminating</reg>. <lb/>
I perceive you are right, said he. I suppose <lb/>
he has purloined from me two hundred guineas, which I <reg orig="in-|trusted">intrusted</reg> <lb/>
to his fidelity. And yet I received a letter;&mdash;but <lb/>
that may likewise be a forgery. By my soul, continued he, <lb/>
in a tone that had more of satisfaction than disappointment <lb/>
in it, this fellow was an adept at his trade. I do not repine. <lb/>
I have bought the exhibition at a cheap rate. The pains <lb/>
that he took did not merit a less recompense. I am glad <lb/>
that he was contented with so little. Had he persisted he <lb/>
might have raised the price far above its value. 'Twill be <lb/>
lamentable if he receive more than he stipulated for; if, in <lb/>
his last purchase, the gallows should be thrown into the <reg orig="bar-|gain">bargain</reg>. <lb/>
May he have the wisdom to see that a halter, though <lb/>
not included in his terms, is only a new instance of his good <lb/>
fortune; but his cunning will hardly carry him thus far. <lb/>
His stupidity will, no doubt, prefer a lingering to a sudden <lb/>
exit.</p>
<p>But this man and his destiny are trifles. Let us leave <lb/>
them to themselves. Your name is Constantia. 'Twas <lb/>
given you I suppose that you might be known by it. Pr'ythee, <lb/>
Constantia, was this the only purpose that brought you hither? <lb/>
If it were, it has received as ample a discussion as it merits. <lb/>
<pb n="133" entity="eaf033v5_0146" pid="uva-lib:350412"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">12</fw></pb>
You <hi rend="italic">came</hi> for this end, but will remain, I hope, for a better <lb/>
one. Having dismissed Craig and his plots, let us now talk <lb/>
of each other.</p>
<p>I confess, said the lady, with a hesitation she could not <lb/>
subdue, this was not my only purpose. One much more <lb/>
important has produced this visit.</p>
<p>Indeed! pray let me know it. I am glad that so trivial <lb/>
an object as Craig, did not occupy the first place in your <lb/>
thoughts. Proceed, I beseech you.</p>
<p>It is a subject on which I cannot enter without hesitation. <lb/>
A hesitation unworthy of me.&mdash;</p>
<p>Stop, cried Ormond, rising and touching the bell, nothing <lb/>
like time to make a conquest of embarrassment. We will <lb/>
defer this conference six minutes, just while we eat our <reg orig="din-|ner">dinner</reg>.</p>
<p>At the same moment a servant entered, with two plates <lb/>
and the usual apparatus for dinner. On seeing this she rose <lb/>
in some hurry, to depart. I thought, Sir, you were <reg orig="disen-|gaged">disengaged</reg>. <lb/>
I will call at some other hour.</p>
<p>He seized her hand, and held her from going, but with an <lb/>
air by no means disrespectful. Nay, said he, what is it that <lb/>
scares you away? Are you terrified at the mention of <reg orig="vic-|tuals">victuals</reg>? <lb/>
You must have fasted long when it comes to that. <lb/>
I told you true. I am disengaged, but not from the <reg orig="obliga-|tion">obligation</reg> <lb/>
of eating and drinking. No doubt <hi rend="italic">you</hi> have dined. No <lb/>
reason why <hi rend="italic">I</hi> should go without my dinner. If you do not <lb/>
choose to partake with me, so much the better. Your <reg orig="tem-|perance">temperance</reg> <lb/>
ought to dispense with two meals in an hour. Be <lb/>
a looker on, or, if that will not do, retire into my library, <lb/>
where, in six minutes, I will be with you; and lend you my <lb/>
aid in the arduous task of telling me what you came with an <lb/>
intention of telling.</p>
<p>This singular address disconcerted and abashed her. She <lb/>
was contented to follow the servant silently into an adjoining <lb/>
apartment. Here she reflected with no small surprise on <lb/>
the behavior of this man. Though ruffled, she was not <lb/>
heartily displeased with it. She had scarcely time to <reg orig="recol-|lect">recollect</reg> <lb/>
herself, when he entered. He immediately seated her, <lb/>
and himself opposite to her. He fixed his eyes without <reg orig="scru-|ple">scruple</reg> <lb/>
on her face. His gaze was steadfast, but not insolent or <lb/>
<pb n="134" entity="eaf033v5_0147" pid="uva-lib:350413"/>
oppressive. He surveyed her with the looks with which he <lb/>
would have eyed a charming portrait. His attention was <lb/>
occupied with what he saw, as that of an artist is occupied <lb/>
when viewing a Madonna of Rafaello. At length he broke <lb/>
silence.</p>
<p>At dinner I was busy in thinking what it was you had to <lb/>
disclose. I will not fatigue you with my guesses. They <lb/>
would be impertinent, as long as the truth is going to be <reg orig="dis-|closed.&mdash;He">disclosed.&mdash;He</reg> <lb/>
paused, and then continued. But I see you <lb/>
cannot dispense with my aid. Perhaps your business relates <lb/>
to Helena. She has done wrong, and you wish me to <reg orig="re-|buke">rebuke</reg> <lb/>
the girl.</p>
<p>Constantia profited by this opening, and said, yes, she has <lb/>
done wrong. It is true, my business relates to her. I came <lb/>
hither as a suppliant in her behalf. Will you not assist her <lb/>
in recovering the path from which she has deviated? She <lb/>
left it from confiding more in the judgment of her guide than <lb/>
her own. There is one method of repairing the evil. It <lb/>
lies with you to repair that evil.</p>
<p>During this address, the gaiety of Ormond disappeared. <lb/>
He fixed his eyes on Constantia with new and even pathetic <lb/>
earnestness. I guessed as much, said he. I have often <lb/>
been deceived in my judgment of characters. Perhaps I do <lb/>
not comprehend your's. Yet it is not little that I have heard <lb/>
respecting you. Something I have seen. I begin to <reg orig="sus-|pect">suspect</reg> <lb/>
a material error in my theory of human nature. <reg orig="Hap-|py">Happy</reg> <lb/>
will it be for Helena if my suspicions be groundless.</p>
<p>You are Helena's friend. Be mine also, and advise me. <lb/>
Shall I marry this girl or not? You know on what terms <lb/>
we live. Are they suitable to our respective characters? <lb/>
Shall I wed this girl, or shall things remain as they are?</p>
<p>I have an irreconcilable aversion to a sad brow and a sick <lb/>
bed. Helena is grieved, because her neighbors sneer and <lb/>
point at her. So far she is a fool, but that is a folly of which <lb/>
she never will be cured. Marriage, it seems, will set all <lb/>
right. Answer me, Constantia, shall I marry?</p>
<p>There was something in the tone, but more in the tenor <lb/>
of this address that startled her. There was nothing in this <lb/>
man but what came upon her unaware. This sudden <reg orig="effu-|sion">effusion</reg> <lb/>
of confidence, was particularly unexpected and <reg orig="embar-|rassing">embarrassing</reg>. <lb/>
She scarcely knew whether to regard it as serious <lb/>
<pb n="135" entity="eaf033v5_0148" pid="uva-lib:350414"/>
or a jest. On observing her indisposed to speak, he <reg orig="contin-|ued">continued</reg>.</p>
<p>Away with these impertinent circuities and scruples. I <lb/>
know your meaning. Why should I pretend ignorance, <lb/>
and put you to the trouble of explanation? You came hither <lb/>
with no other view than to exact this question, and <reg orig="fur-|nish">furnish</reg> <lb/>
an answer. Why should not we come at once to the <lb/>
point? I have for some time been dubious on this head. <lb/>
There is something wanting to determine the balance. If <lb/>
you have that something, throw it into the proper scale.</p>
<p>You err if you think this manner of addressing you is <lb/>
wild or improper. This girl is the subject of discourse. If <lb/>
she was not to be so, why did you favor me with this visit? <lb/>
You have sought me, and introduced yourself. I have, in <lb/>
like manner, overlooked ordinary forms: a negligence that <lb/>
has been systematic with me; but, in the present case, <reg orig="par-|ticularly">particularly</reg> <lb/>
justifiable by your example. Shame upon you, <lb/>
presumptuous girl, to suppose yourself the only rational <reg orig="be-|ing">being</reg> <lb/>
among mankind. And yet, if you thought so, why did <lb/>
you thus unceremoniously intrude upon my retirements? <lb/>
This act is of a piece with the rest. It shows you to be one <lb/>
whose existence I did not believe possible.</p>
<p>Take care. You know not what you have done. You <lb/>
came hither as Helena's friend. Perhaps time may shew that <lb/>
in this visit, you have performed the behest of her bitterest <lb/>
enemy. But that is out of season. This girl is our mutual <lb/>
property. You are her friend; I am her lover. Her <reg orig="hap-|piness">happiness</reg> <lb/>
is precious in my eyes and in your's. To the rest of <lb/>
mankind she is a noisome weed, that cannot be shunned too <lb/>
cautiously, nor trampled on too much. If we forsake her, <lb/>
infamy that is now kept at bay, will seize upon her, and <lb/>
while it mangles her form, will tear from her her innocence. <lb/>
She has no arms with which to contend against that foe. <lb/>
Marriage will place her at once in security. Shall it be? <lb/>
You have an exact knowledge of her strength and her <reg orig="weak-|ness">weakness</reg>. <lb/>
Of me, you know little. Perhaps, before that <reg orig="ques-|tion">question</reg> <lb/>
can be satisfactorily answered, it is requisite to know the <lb/>
qualities of her husband. Be my character henceforth the <lb/>
subject of your study. I will furnish you with all the light <lb/>
in my power. Be not hasty in deciding, but when your <reg orig="de-|cision">decision</reg> <lb/>
is formed, let me know it. He waited for an <reg orig="an-|swer">answer</reg>, <lb/>
<pb n="136" entity="eaf033v5_0149" pid="uva-lib:350415"/>
which she, at length, summoned resolution enough to <lb/>
give.</p>
<p>You have come to the chief point which I had in view in <lb/>
making this visit. To say truth, I came hither to <reg orig="remon-|strate">remonstrate</reg> <lb/>
with you on withholding that which Helena may justly <lb/>
claim from you. Her happiness will be unquestionably <reg orig="re-|stored">restored</reg>, <lb/>
and increased by it. Your's will not be impaired. <lb/>
Matrimony will not produce any essential change in your <lb/>
situation. It will produce no greater or different intercourse <lb/>
than now exists. Helena is on the brink of a gulf which <lb/>
I shudder to look upon. I believe that you will not injure <lb/>
yourself by snatching her from it. I am sure that you will <lb/>
confer an inexpressible benefit upon her. Let me then <reg orig="per-|suade">persuade</reg> <lb/>
you to do her and yourself justice.</p>
<p>No persuasion, said Ormond, after recovering from a fit <lb/>
of thoughtfulness, is needful for this end; I only want to be <lb/>
convinced. You have decided, but I fear hastily. By <lb/>
what inscrutable influences are our steps guided. Come, <lb/>
proceed in your exhortations. Argue with the utmost <reg orig="clear-|ness">clearness</reg> <lb/>
and cogency. Arm yourself with all the irresistibles <lb/>
of eloquence. Yet you are building nothing. You are <lb/>
only demolishing. Your argument is one thing. Its <reg orig="ten-|dency">tendency</reg> <lb/>
is another; and is the reverse of all you expect and <lb/>
desire. My assent will be refused with an obstinacy <reg orig="pro-|portioned">proportioned</reg> <lb/>
to the force that you exert to obtain it, and to the <lb/>
just application of that force.</p>
<p>I see, replied the lady, smiling and leaving her seat, you <lb/>
can talk in riddles, as well as other people. This visit has <lb/>
been too long. I shall, indeed, be sorry, if my interference, <lb/>
instead of serving my friend, has injured her. I have acted <lb/>
an uncommon, and, as it may seem, an ambiguous part. I <lb/>
shall be contented with construing my motives in my own <lb/>
way. I wish you a good evening.</p>
<p>'Tis false, cried he, sternly, you do not wish it.</p>
<p>How? Exclaimed the astonished Constantia.</p>
<p>I will put your sincerity to the test. Allow me to spend <lb/>
this evening in your company; then it will be well spent, and <lb/>
I shall believe your wishes sincere. Else, continued he, <lb/>
changing his affected austerity into a smile, Constantia is a liar.</p>
<p>You are a singular man. I hardly know how to <reg orig="under-|stand">understand</reg> <lb/>
you.</p>
<pb n="137" entity="eaf033v5_0150" pid="uva-lib:350416"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">12*</fw></pb>
<p>Well. Words are made to carry meanings. You shall have <lb/>
them in abundance. Your house is your citadel. I will not <lb/>
enter it without leave. Permit me to visit you when I please. <lb/>
But that is too much. It is more than I would allow you. <lb/>
When will you permit me to visit you?</p>
<p>I cannot answer when I do not understand. You clothe <lb/>
your thoughts in a garb so uncouth, that I know not in what <lb/>
light they are to be viewed.</p>
<p>Well, now, I thought you understood my language, and <lb/>
were an English woman, but I will use another. Shall I <lb/>
have the honor (bowing with a courtly air of supplication) <lb/>
of occasionally paying my respects to you at your own <reg orig="dwell-|ing">dwelling</reg>. <lb/>
It would be cruel to condemn those who have the <lb/>
happiness of knowing Miss Dudley, to fashionable restraints. <lb/>
At what hour will she be least incommoded by a visitant?</p>
<p>I am as little pleased with formalities, replied the lady, as <lb/>
you are. My friends I cannot see too often. They need <lb/>
to consult merely their own convenience. Those who are <lb/>
not my friends I cannot see too seldom. You have only to <lb/>
establish your title to that name, and your welcome at all <lb/>
times, is sure. Till then you must not look for it.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XVI.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Here</hi> ended this conference. She had, by no means, <lb/>
suspected the manner in which it would be conducted. All <lb/>
punctilios were trampled under foot, by the impetuosity of <lb/>
Ormond. Things were, at once, and without delay, placed <lb/>
upon a certain footing. The point, which ordinary persons <lb/>
would have employed months in attaining, was reached in a <lb/>
moment. While these incidents were fresh in her memory, <lb/>
they were accompanied with a sort of trepidation, the <reg orig="off-|spring">offspring</reg> <lb/>
at once of pleasure and surprise.</p>
<p>Ormond had not deceived her expectations, but hearsay <lb/>
and personal examination, however uniform their testimony <lb/>
may be, produce a very different impression. In her <reg orig="pre-|sent">present</reg> <lb/>
reflections, Helena and her lover approached to the front <lb/>
of the stage, and were viewed with equal perspicuity. One <lb/>
<pb n="138" entity="eaf033v5_0151" pid="uva-lib:350417"/>
consequence of this was, that their characters were more <lb/>
powerfully contrasted with each other, and the ilegibility of <lb/>
marriage, appeared not quite so incontestible as before.</p>
<p>Was not equality implied in this compact? Marriage is <lb/>
an instrument of pleasure or pain in proportion as this <reg orig="equal-|ity">equality</reg> <lb/>
is more or less. What, but the fascination of his senses <lb/>
is it, that ties Ormond to Helena. Is this a basis on which <lb/>
marriage may properly be built?</p>
<p>If things had not gone thus far, the impropriety of <reg orig="mar-|riage">marriage</reg> <lb/>
could not be doubted; but, at present, there is a choice <lb/>
of evils, and that may now be desirable, which at a former <lb/>
period, and in different circumstances, would have been <lb/>
clearly otherwise.</p>
<p>The evils of the present connexion are know; those of <lb/>
marriage are future and contingent; Helena cannot be the <lb/>
object of a genuine and lasting passion; another may; this <lb/>
is not merely possible; nothing is more likely to happen. <lb/>
This event, therefore, ought to be included in our calculation. <lb/>
There would be a material deficiency without it. What was <lb/>
the amount of the misery that would, in this case, ensue.</p>
<p>Constantia was qualified, beyond most others, to form an <lb/>
adequate conception of this misery. One of the <reg orig="ingredi-|ents">ingredients</reg> <lb/>
in her character was a mild and steadfast enthusaism. <lb/>
Her sensibilities to social pleasure, and her conceptions of <lb/>
the benefits to flow from the conformity and concurrence of <lb/>
intentions and wishes, heightening and refining the sensual <lb/>
passion, were exquisite.</p>
<p>There, indeed, were evils, the foresight of which tended <lb/>
to prevent them, but was there wisdom in creating obstacles <lb/>
in the way of a suitable alliance. Before we act, we must <lb/>
consider not only the misery produced, but the happiness <lb/>
precluded by our measures.</p>
<p>In no case, perhaps, is the decision of a human being <lb/>
impartial, or totally uninfluenced by sinister and selfish <reg orig="mo-|tives">motives</reg>. <lb/>
If Constantia surpassed others, it was not, because, <lb/>
her motives were pure, but, because they possessed more <lb/>
of purity than those of others. Sinister considerations flow <lb/>
in upon us through imperceptible channels, and modify our <lb/>
thoughts in numberless ways, without our being truly <reg orig="con-|scious">conscious</reg> <lb/>
of their presence. Constantia was young, and her <lb/>
heart was open at a thousand pores, to the love of excellence. <lb/>
<pb n="139" entity="eaf033v5_0152" pid="uva-lib:350418"/>
The image of Ormond occupied the chief place in her <lb/>
fancy, and was endowed with attractive and venerable <reg orig="quali-|ties">qualities</reg>. <lb/>
A bias was hence created that swayed her thoughts, <lb/>
though she knew not that they were swayed. To this <lb/>
might justly be imputed, some part of that reluctance which <lb/>
she now felt to give Ormond to Helena. But this was not <lb/>
sufficient to turn the scale. That which had previously <lb/>
mounted, was indeed heavier than before, but this addition <lb/>
did not enable it to outweigh its opposite. Marriage was <lb/>
still the best upon the whole, but her heart was tortured <lb/>
to think that, best as it was, it abounded with so many evils.</p>
<p>On the evening of the next day, Ormond entered with <lb/>
careless abruptness, Constantia's sitting apartment. He <lb/>
was introduced to her father. A general and unrestrained <lb/>
conversation immediately took place. Ormond addressed <lb/>
Mr. Dudley with the familiarity of an old acquaintance. In <lb/>
three minutes all embarrassment was discarded. The lady <lb/>
and her visitant were accurate observers of each other. In <lb/>
the remarks of the latter, and his vein was an abundant one, <lb/>
there was a freedom and originality altogether new to his <lb/>
hearers. In his easiest and sprightliest sallies were tokens <lb/>
of a mind habituated to profound and extensive views. His <lb/>
associations were formed on a comprehensive scale.</p>
<p>He pretended to nothing, and studied the concealments of <lb/>
ambiguity more in reality than in appearance. Constantia, <lb/>
however, discovered a sufficient resemblance between their <lb/>
theories of virtue and duty. The difference between them <lb/>
lay in the inferences arbitrarily deduced, and in which two <lb/>
persons may vary without end, and yet never be repugnant. <lb/>
Constantia delighted her companion by the facility with <lb/>
which she entered into his meaning, the sagacity she <reg orig="dis-|played">displayed</reg> <lb/>
in drawing out his hints, circumscribing his <reg orig="conjec-|tures">conjectures</reg>, <lb/>
and thwarting or qualifying his maxims. The scene <lb/>
was generally replete with ardor and contention, and yet the <lb/>
impression left on the mind of Ormond was full of harmony. <lb/>
Her discourse tended to rouse him from his lethargy, to <lb/>
furnish him with powerful excitements, and the time spent in <lb/>
her company, seemed like a doubling of existence.</p>
<p>The comparison could not but suggest itself, between this <lb/>
scene and that exhibited by Helena. With the latter <reg orig="volup-|tuous">voluptuous</reg> <lb/>
blandishments, musical prattle, and silent but <reg orig="express-|ive">expressive</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="140" entity="eaf033v5_0153" pid="uva-lib:350419"/>
homage, composed a banquet delicious for a while, but <lb/>
whose sweetness now began to pall upon his taste. It <reg orig="suppli-|ed">supplied</reg> <lb/>
him with no new ideas, and hindered him, by the lulling <lb/>
sensations it inspired, from profiting by his former <reg orig="acquisi-|tions">acquisitions</reg>. <lb/>
Helena was beautiful. Apply the scale, and not a <reg orig="mem-|ber">member</reg> <lb/>
was found inelegantly disposed, or negligently moulded. <lb/>
Not a curve that was blemished by an angle or ruffled by <lb/>
asperities. The irradiations of her eyes were able to <reg orig="dis-|solve">dissolve</reg> <lb/>
the knottiest fibres, and their azure was serene beyond <lb/>
any that nature had elsewhere exhibited. Over the rest of <lb/>
her form the glistening and rosy hues were diffused with <lb/>
prodigal luxuriance, and mingled in endless and wanton <lb/>
variety. Yet this image had fewer attractions even to the <lb/>
senses than that of Constantia. So great is the difference <lb/>
between forms animated by different degrees of intelligence.</p>
<p>The interviews of Ormond and Constantia grew more <lb/>
frequent. The progress which they made in the knowledge <lb/>
of each other was rapid. Two positions, that were favorite <lb/>
ones with him, were quickly subverted. He was suddenly <lb/>
changed, from being one of the calumniators of the female <lb/>
sex, to one of its warmest eulogists. This was a point on <lb/>
which Constantia had ever been a vigorous disputant, but <lb/>
her arguments, in their direct tendency, would never have <lb/>
made a convert of this man. Their force, intrinsically <reg orig="con-|sidered">considered</reg>, <lb/>
was nothing. He drew his conclusions from <reg orig="inci-|dental">incidental</reg> <lb/>
circumstances. Her reasonings might be fallacious <lb/>
or valid, but they were so composed, arranged and delivered, <lb/>
were drawn from such sources, and accompanied with such <lb/>
illustrations, as plainly testified a manlike energy in the <reg orig="rea-|soner">reasoner</reg>. <lb/>
In this indirect and circuitous way, her point was <lb/>
unanswerably established.</p>
<p>Your reasoning is bad, he would say; every one of your <lb/>
conclusions is false. Not a single allegation but may be <lb/>
easily confuted, and yet I allow that your position is <reg orig="incon-|trovertibly">incontrovertibly</reg> <lb/>
proved by them. How bewildered is that man <lb/>
who never thinks for himself! who rejects a principle merely <lb/>
because the arguments brought in support of it are <reg orig="insuffi-|cient">insufficient</reg>. <lb/>
I must not reject the truth, because another has <lb/>
unjustifiably adopted it. I want to reach a certain hill-top. <lb/>
Another has reached it before me, but the ladder he used is <lb/>
too weak to bear me. What then? Am I to stay below <lb/>
<pb n="141" entity="eaf033v5_0154" pid="uva-lib:350420"/>
on that account? No; I have only to construct one suitable <lb/>
to the purpose, and of strength sufficient.</p>
<p>A second maxim had never been confuted till now. It <lb/>
inculcated the insignificance and hollowness of love. No <lb/>
pleasure he thought was to be despised for its own sake. <lb/>
Every thing was good in its place, but amorous gratifications <lb/>
were to be degraded to the bottom of the catalogue. The <lb/>
enjoyments of music and landscape, were of a much higher <lb/>
order. Epicurism itself was entitled to more respect. Love, <lb/>
in itself, was in his opinion, of little worth, and only of <reg orig="im-|portance">importance</reg> <lb/>
as the source of the most terrible of intellectual <lb/>
maladies. Sexual sensations associating themselves, in a <lb/>
certain way, with our ideas, beget a disease, which has, <lb/>
indeed, found no place in the catalogue, but is a case of <lb/>
more entire subversion and confusion of mind than any <lb/>
other. The victim is callous to the sentiments of honor and <lb/>
shame, insensible to the most palpable distinctions of right <lb/>
and wrong, a systematic opponent of testimony, and obstinate <lb/>
perverter of truth.</p>
<p>Ormond was partly right. Madness like death can be <lb/>
averted by no foresight or previous contrivance. This <reg orig="pro-|bably">probably</reg> <lb/>
is one of its characteristics. He that witnesses its <lb/>
influence on another, with most horror, and most fervently <lb/>
deprecates its ravages, is not therefore more safe. This <lb/>
circumstance was realized in the history of Ormond.</p>
<p>This infatuation, if it may so be called, was gradual in its <lb/>
progress. The sensations which Helena was now able to <lb/>
excite, were of a new kind. Her power was not merely <lb/>
weakened, but her endeavors counteracted their own end. <lb/>
Her fondness was rejected with disdain, or borne with <reg orig="re-|luctance">reluctance</reg>. <lb/>
The lady was not slow in perceiving this <lb/>
change. The stroke of death would have been more <reg orig="ac-|ceptable">acceptable</reg>. <lb/>
His own reflections were too tormenting, to make <lb/>
him willing to discuss them in words. He was not aware of <lb/>
the effects produced by this change in his demeanor, till <lb/>
informed of it by herself.</p>
<p>One evening he displayed symptoms of uncommon <reg orig="dissat-|isfaction">dissatisfaction</reg>. <lb/>
Her tenderness was unable to dispel it. He <lb/>
complained of want of sleep. This afforded a hint, which <lb/>
she drew forth into one of her enchanting ditties. Habit <lb/>
had almost conferred upon her the power of spontaneous <lb/>
<pb n="142" entity="eaf033v5_0155" pid="uva-lib:350421"/>
poesy, and while she pressed his forehead to her bosom, she <lb/>
warbled forth a strain airy and exuberant in numbers, tender <lb/>
and extatic in its imagery.</p>

</lg>
<p>Here her voice sunk, and the line terminated in a sigh. <lb/>
Her museful ardors were chilled by the looks of Ormond. <lb/>
Absorbed in his own thoughts, he appeared scarcely to <reg orig="at-|tend">attend</reg> <lb/>
to this strain. His sternness was proof against her <lb/>
accustomed fascinations. At length she pathetically <reg orig="com-|plained">complained</reg> <lb/>
of his coldness, and insinuated her suspicions, that <lb/>
his affection was transferred to another object. He started <lb/>
from her embrace, and after two or three turns across the <lb/>
room, he stood before her. His large eyes were steadfastly <lb/>
fixed upon her face.</p>
<p>Aye, said he, thou hast guessed right. The love, poor <lb/>
as it was, that I had for thee, is gone. Henceforth thou art <lb/>
desolate indeed. Would to God thou wert wise. Thy <lb/>
woes are but beginning; I fear they will terminate fatally; <lb/>
if so, the catastrophe cannot come too quickly.</p>
<pb n="143" entity="eaf033v5_0156" pid="uva-lib:350422"/>
<p>I disdain to appeal to thy justice, Helena, to remind thee <lb/>
of conditions solemnly and explicitly assumed. Shall thy <lb/>
blood he upon thy own head? No. I will hear it myself. <lb/>
Though the load would crush a mountain, I will hear it.</p>
<p>I cannot help it; I make not myself; I am moulded by <lb/>
circumstances; whether I shall love thee or not, is no longer <lb/>
in my own choice. Marriage is, indeed, still in my power. <lb/>
I may give thee my name, and share with thee my fortune. <lb/>
Will these content thee? Thou canst not partake of my <lb/>
love. Thou canst have no part in my tenderness. These <lb/>
are reserved for another more worthy than thou.</p>
<p>But no. Thy state is, to the last degree, forlorn; even <lb/>
marriage is denied thee. Thou wast contented to take me <lb/>
without it; to dispense with the name of wife, but the being <lb/>
who has displaced thy image in my heart, is of a different <lb/>
class. She will be to me a wife, or nothing, and I must be <lb/>
her husband, or perish.</p>
<p>Do not deceive thyself, Helena. I know what it is in <lb/>
which thou hast placed thy felicity. Life is worth retaining <lb/>
by thee, but on one condition. I know the incurableness of <lb/>
thy infirmity; but be not deceived. Thy happiness is <reg orig="rav-|ished">ravished</reg> <lb/>
from thee. The condition on which thou consentedst <lb/>
to live, is annulled. I love thee no longer.</p>
<p>No truth was ever more delicious; none was ever more <lb/>
detestable. I fight against conviction, and I cling to it. <lb/>
That I love thee no longer, is at once a subject of joy and of <lb/>
mourning. I struggle to believe thee superior to this shock; <lb/>
that thou wilt be happy though deserted by me. Whatever <lb/>
be thy destiny, my reason will not allow me to be miserable <lb/>
on that account. Yet I would give the world; I would <lb/>
forfeit every claim but that which I hope upon the heart of <lb/>
Constantia, to be sure that thy tranquillity will survive this <lb/>
stroke.</p>
<p>But let come what will, look no longer to me for offices <lb/>
of love. Henceforth, all intercouse of tenderness ceases. <lb/>
Perhaps all personal intercourse whatever. But though this <lb/>
good be refused, thou art sure of independence. I will <lb/>
guard thy ease and thy honor with a father's scrupulousness. <lb/>
Would to heaven a sister could be created by adoption. I <lb/>
am willing, for thy sake, to be an impostor. I will own thee <lb/>
to the world for my sister, and carry thee whither the cheat <lb/>
<pb n="144" entity="eaf033v5_0157" pid="uva-lib:350423"/>
shall never be detected. I would devote my whole life to <lb/>
prevarication and falsehood, for thy sake, if that would <reg orig="suf-|fice">suffice</reg> <lb/>
to make thee happy.</p>
<p>To this speech Helena had nothing to answer. Her sobs <lb/>
and tears choked all utterance. She hid her face with her <lb/>
handkerchief, and sat powerless and overwhelmed with <reg orig="des-|pair">despair</reg>. <lb/>
Ormond traversed the room uneasily. Sometimes <lb/>
moving to and fro with quick steps, sometimes standing and <lb/>
eyeing her with looks of compassion. At length he spoke.</p>
<p>It is time to leave you. This is the first night that you <lb/>
will spend in dreary solitude. I know it will be sleepless and <lb/>
full of agony; but the sentence cannot be recalled. <reg orig="Hence-|forth">Henceforth</reg> <lb/>
regard me as a brother. I will prove myself one. All <lb/>
other claims are swallowed up in a superior affection.&mdash;In <lb/>
saying this, he left the house, and almost without intending it, <lb/>
found himself in a few minutes at Mr. Dudley's door.</p>
<ornament type="line"/>
</div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="XVII" id="d25">
<head>CHAPTER XVII.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> politeness of Melbourne had somewhat abated Mr. <lb/>
Dudley's aversion to society. He allowed himself sometimes <lb/>
to comply with urgent invitations. On this evening he <reg orig="hap-|pened">happened</reg> <lb/>
to be at the house of that gentleman. Ormond <reg orig="en-|tered">entered</reg>, <lb/>
and found Constantia alone. An interview of this <lb/>
kind was seldom enjoyed, though earnestly wished for by <lb/>
Constantia, who was eager to renew the subject of her first <lb/>
conversation with Ormond. I have already explained the <lb/>
situation of her mind. All her wishes were concentred in <lb/>
the marriage of Helena. The eligibility of this scheme, in <lb/>
every view which she took of it, appeared in a stronger light. <lb/>
She was not aware that any new obstacle had arisen. She <lb/>
was free from the consciousness of any secret bias. Much <lb/>
less did her modesty suspect, that she herself would prove <lb/>
an insuperable impediment to this plan.</p>
<p>There was more than usual solemnity in Ormond's <reg orig="de-|meanor">demeanor</reg>. <lb/>
After he was seated, he continued, contrary to <lb/>
his custom, to be silent. These singularities were not <reg orig="unob-|served">unobserved</reg> <lb/>
by Constantia. They did not, however, divert her <lb/>
from her purpose.</p>
<pb n="145" entity="eaf033v5_0158" pid="uva-lib:350424"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">13</fw></pb>
<p>I am glad to see you, said she. We so seldom enjoy the <lb/>
advantage of a private interview. I have much to say to <lb/>
you. You authorize me to deliberate on your actions, and, <lb/>
in some measure, to prescribe to you. This is a province <lb/>
which I hope to discharge with integrity and diligence. I <lb/>
am convinced that Helena's happiness and your own, can be <lb/>
secured in one way only. I will emulate your candor, and <lb/>
come at once to the point. Why have you delayed so long <lb/>
the justice that is due to this helpless and lovely girl? There <lb/>
are a thousand reasons why you should think of no other <lb/>
alternative. You have been pleased to repose some degree <lb/>
of confidence in my judgment. Hear my full and <reg orig="delibe-|rate">deliberate</reg> <lb/>
opinion. Make Helena your wife. This is the <reg orig="unequi-|vocal">unequivocal</reg> <lb/>
prescription of your duty.</p>
<p>This address was heard by Ormond without surprise; <lb/>
but his countenance betrayed the acuteness of his feelings. <lb/>
The bitterness that overflowed his heart, was perceptible in <lb/>
his tone when he spoke.</p>
<p>Most egregiously are you deceived. Such is the line with <lb/>
which human capacity presumes to fathom futurity. With <lb/>
all your discernment, you do not see that marriage would <lb/>
effectually destroy me. You do not see that, whether <reg orig="bene-|ficial">beneficial</reg>, <lb/>
or otherwise, in its effects, marriage is impossible. You <lb/>
are merely prompting me to suicide; but how shall I inflict <lb/>
the wound? Where is the weapon? See you not that I am <lb/>
powerless? Leap, say you, into the flames. See you not <lb/>
that I am fettered? Will a mountain move at your bidding, <lb/>
sooner than I in the path, which you prescribe to me?</p>
<p>This speech was inexplicable. She pressed him to speak <lb/>
less enigmatically. Had he formed his resolution? If so, <lb/>
arguments and remonstrances were superfluous. Without <lb/>
noticing her interrogatories, he continued.</p>
<p>I am too hasty in condemning you. You judge, not <lb/>
against, but without knowledge. When sufficiently <reg orig="inform-|ed">informed</reg>, <lb/>
your decision will be right. Yet how can you be <reg orig="igno-|rant">ignorant</reg>! <lb/>
Can you, for a moment, contemplate yourself and me, <lb/>
and not perceive an insuperable bar to this union?</p>
<p>You place me, said Constantia, in a very disagreeable <lb/>
predicament. I have not deserved this treatment from you. <lb/>
This is an unjustifiable deviation from plain dealing. Of <lb/>
<pb n="146" entity="eaf033v5_0159" pid="uva-lib:350425"/>
what impediment do you speak. I can safely say that I <lb/>
know of none.</p>
<p>Well, resumed he, with augmented eagerness, I must <lb/>
supply you with knowledge. I repeat, that I perfectly rely <lb/>
on the rectitude of your judgment. Summon all your <reg orig="saga-|city">sagacity</reg> <lb/>
and disinterestedness, and choose for me. You know <lb/>
in what light Helena has been viewed by me. I have <reg orig="ceas-|ed">ceased</reg> <lb/>
to view her in this light. She has become an object of <lb/>
indifference. Nay, I am not certain that I do not hate her. <lb/>
Not indeed for her own sake, but because I love another. <lb/>
Shall I marry her whom I hate, when there exists one whom <lb/>
I love with unconquerable ardor?</p>
<p>Constantia was thunderstruck with this intelligence. She <lb/>
looked at him with some expression of doubt. How is this? <lb/>
said she. Why did you not tell me this before?</p>
<p>When I last talked with you on this subject, I knew it not <lb/>
myself. It has occurred since. I have seized the first <reg orig="oc-|casion">occasion</reg> <lb/>
that has offered, to inform you of it. Say now, since <lb/>
such is my condition, ought Helena to be my wife?</p>
<p>Constantia was silent. Her heart bled for what she <reg orig="fore-|saw">foresaw</reg> <lb/>
would be the sufferings and forlorn destiny of Helena. <lb/>
She had not courage to inquire further into this new <reg orig="en-|gagement">engagement</reg>.</p>
<p>I wait for your answer, Constantia. Shall I defraud <reg orig="my-|self">myself</reg> <lb/>
of all the happiness which would accrue, from a match <lb/>
of inclination? Shall I put fetters on my usefulness? This <lb/>
is the style in which you speak. Shall I preclude all the <lb/>
good to others, that would flow from a suitable alliance? <lb/>
Shall I abjure the woman I love, and marry her whom I <lb/>
hate?</p>
<p>Hatred, replied the lady, is a harsh word. Helena has <lb/>
not deserved that you should hate her. I own this is a <reg orig="per-|plexing">perplexing</reg> <lb/>
circumstance. It would be wrong to determine <reg orig="has-|tily">hastily</reg>. <lb/>
Suppose you give yourself to Helena, will more than <lb/>
yourself be injured by it? Who is this lady? Will she be <lb/>
rendered unhappy by a determination in favor of another? <lb/>
This is a point of the utmost importance.</p>
<p>At these words, Ormond forsook his seat, and advanced <lb/>
close up to Constantia. You say true. This is a point of <lb/>
inexpressible importance. It would be presumption in me to <lb/>
decide. That is the lady's own province. And now, say <lb/>
<pb n="147" entity="eaf033v5_0160" pid="uva-lib:350426"/>
truly, are you willing to accept Ormond with all his faults. <lb/>
Who but yourself could be mistress of all the springs of my <lb/>
soul? I know the sternness of your probity. This discovery <lb/>
will only make you more strenuously the friend of Helena. <lb/>
Yet why should you not shun either extreme. Lay yourself <lb/>
out of view. And yet, perhaps, the happiness of <reg orig="Constan-|tia">Constantia</reg> <lb/>
is not unconcerned in this question. Is there no part of <lb/>
me in which you discover your own likeness? Am I <reg orig="de-|ceived">deceived</reg>, <lb/>
or is it an incontrolable destiny that unites us?</p>
<p>This declaration was truly unexpected by Constantia. <lb/>
She gathered from it nothing but excitements of grief. <reg orig="Af-|ter">After</reg> <lb/>
some pause, she said. This appeal to me has made no <lb/>
change in my opinion. I still think that justice requires you <lb/>
to become the husband of Helena. As to me, do you think <lb/>
my happiness rests upon so slight a foundation? I cannot <lb/>
love, but when my understanding points out to me the <reg orig="pro-|priety">propriety</reg> <lb/>
of love. Ever since I have known you, I have <reg orig="look-|ed">looked</reg> <lb/>
upon you as rightfully belonging to another. Love <lb/>
could not take place in my circumstances. Yet I will not <lb/>
conceal from you my sentiments. I am not sure that in <reg orig="dif-|ferent">different</reg> <lb/>
circumstances, I should not have loved. I am <reg orig="ac-|quainted">acquainted</reg> <lb/>
with your worth. I do not look for a faultless man. <lb/>
I have met with none whose blemishes were fewer.</p>
<p>It matters not, however, what I should have been. I <reg orig="can-|not">cannot</reg> <lb/>
interfere, in this case, with the claims of my friend. I <lb/>
have no passion to struggle with. I hope, in every <reg orig="vicissi-|tude">vicissitude</reg>, <lb/>
to enjoy your esteem, and nothing more. There is <lb/>
but one way in which mine can be secured, and that is by <lb/>
espousing this unhappy girl.</p>
<p>No, exclaimed Ormond. Require not impossibilities. <lb/>
Helena can never be any thing to me. I should, with <reg orig="un-|speakably">unspeakably</reg> <lb/>
more willingness, assail my own life.</p>
<p>What, said the lady, will Helena think of this sudden and <lb/>
dreadful change. I cannot bear to think upon the feelings <lb/>
that this information will excite.</p>
<p>She knows it already. I have this moment left her. I <lb/>
explained to her, in few words, my motives, and assured her <lb/>
of my unalterable resolution. I have vowed never to see <lb/>
her more, but as a brother, and this vow she has just heard.</p>
<p>Constantia could not suppress her astonishment and <reg orig="com-|passion">compassion</reg> <lb/>
at this intelligence. No, surely, you could not be so <lb/>
<pb n="148" entity="eaf033v5_0161" pid="uva-lib:350427"/>
cruel! And this was done with your usual abruptness, I <lb/>
suppose. Precipitate and implacable man! Cannot you <lb/>
foresee the effects of this madness? You have planted a <reg orig="dag-|ger">dagger</reg> <lb/>
in her heart. You have disappointed me. I did not <lb/>
think you could act so inhumanly.</p>
<p>Nay, beloved Constantia, he not so liberal of your <reg orig="re-|proaches">reproaches</reg>. <lb/>
Would you have me deceive her? She must <lb/>
shortly have known it. Could the truth be told too soon?</p>
<p>Much too soon, replied the lady, fervently. I have <reg orig="al-|ways">always</reg> <lb/>
condemned the maxims by which you act. Your <lb/>
scheme is headlong and barbarous. Could you not regard, <lb/>
with some little compassion, that love which sacrificed for <lb/>
your unworthy sake, honest fame and the peace of virtue? <lb/>
Is she not a poor outcast, goaded by compunction, and <reg orig="hoot-|ed">hooted</reg> <lb/>
at by a malignant and misjudging world, and who was it <lb/>
that reduced her to this deplorable condition? For whose <lb/>
sake, did she willingly consent to brave evils, by which the <lb/>
stoutest heart is appalled? Did this argue no greatness of <lb/>
mind? Who ever surpassed her in fidelity and tenderness? <lb/>
But thus has she been rewarded. I shudder to think what <lb/>
may be the event. Her courage cannot possibly support <lb/>
her, against treatment so harsh; so perversely and wantonly <lb/>
cruel. Heaven grant, that you are not shortly made, <reg orig="bitter-|ly">bitterly</reg> <lb/>
to lament this rashness.</p>
<p>Ormond was penetrated with these reproaches. They <lb/>
persuaded him for a moment that his deed was wrong; that <lb/>
he had not unfolded his intentions to Helena, with a suitable <lb/>
degree of gentleness and caution. Little more was said on <lb/>
this occasion. Constantia exhorted him, in the most earnest <lb/>
and pathetic manner, to return and recant, or extenuate his <lb/>
former declarations. He could not be brought to promise <lb/>
compliance. When he parted from her, however, he was <lb/>
half resolved to act as she advised. Solitary reflection <lb/>
made him change this resolution, and he returned to his own <lb/>
house.</p>
<p>During the night, he did little else, than ruminate on the <lb/>
events of the preceding evening. He entertained little <lb/>
doubt of his ultimate success with Constantia. She gratified <lb/>
him in nothing, but left him every thing to hope. She had <lb/>
hitherto, it seems, regarded him with indifference, but this <lb/>
had been sufficiently explained. That conduct would be <lb/>
<pb n="149" entity="eaf033v5_0162" pid="uva-lib:350428"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">13*</fw></pb>
pursued, and that passion be entertained, which her <reg orig="judg-|ment">judgment</reg> <lb/>
should previously approve. What then was the <reg orig="obsta-|cle">obstacle</reg>? <lb/>
It originated in the claims of Helena, but what were <lb/>
these claims? It was fully ascertained that he should never be <lb/>
united to this girl. If so, the end contemplated by <reg orig="Con-|stantia">Constantia</reg>, <lb/>
and for the sake of which only, his application was <lb/>
rejected, could never be obtained. Unless her rejection of <lb/>
him, could procure a husband for her friend, it would, on <lb/>
her own principles, be improper and superfluous.</p>
<p>What was to be done with Helena? It was a terrible <reg orig="al-|ternative">alternative</reg> <lb/>
to which he was reduced; to marry her or see her <lb/>
perish. But was this alternative quite sure? Could not she, <lb/>
by time or by judicious treatment, be reconciled to her lot? <lb/>
It was to be feared that he had not made a suitable <reg orig="begin-|ning">beginning</reg>; <lb/>
and yet, perhaps, it was most expedient, that a hasty <lb/>
and abrupt sentence should be succeeded by forbearance and <lb/>
lenity. He regretted his precipitation, and though unused <lb/>
to the melting mood, tears were wrung from him, by the <lb/>
idea of the misery which he had probably occasioned. He <lb/>
was determined to repair his misconduct as speedily as <reg orig="pos-|sible">possible</reg>, <lb/>
and to pay her a conciliating visit the next morning.</p>
<p>He went early to her house. He was informed by the <lb/>
servant that her mistress had not yet risen. Was it usual, he <lb/>
asked, for her to lie so late? No, he was answered; she <lb/>
never knew it happen before, but she supposed her mistress <lb/>
was not well. She was just going into her chamber to see <lb/>
what was the matter.</p>
<p>Why, said Ormond, do you suppose that she is sick?</p>
<p>She was poorly last night. About nine o'clock she sent <lb/>
out for some physic to make her sleep.</p>
<p>To make her sleep? exclaimed Ormond, in a faltering <lb/>
and affrighted accent.</p>
<p>Yes, she said she wanted it for that. So I went to the <lb/>
pothecary's. When I come back, she was very poorly <reg orig="in-|deed">indeed</reg>. <lb/>
I asked her if I mightn't set up with her. No she <lb/>
says; I do not want any body. You may go to bed as soon <lb/>
as you please, and tell Fabian to do the same. I shall not <lb/>
want you again.</p>
<p>What did you buy?</p>
<p>Some kind of water, laud'num I think they call it. She <lb/>
<pb n="150" entity="eaf033v5_0163" pid="uva-lib:350429"/>
wrote it down and I carried the paper to Mr. Eckhart's and <lb/>
he gave it to me in a bottle, and I gave it to my mistress.</p>
<p>'Tis well. Retire. I will see how she is myself.</p>
<p>Ormond had conceived himself fortified against every <lb/>
disaster. He looked for nothing but evil, and, therefore, in <lb/>
ordinary cases, regarded its approach without fear or <reg orig="sur-|prise">surprise</reg>. <lb/>
Now, however, he found that his tremors would not <lb/>
be stilled. His perturbations increased with every step that <lb/>
brought him nearer to her chamber. He knocked, but no <lb/>
answer was returned. He opened, advanced to the <reg orig="bed-|side">bedside</reg>, <lb/>
and drew back the curtains. He shrunk from the <lb/>
spectacle that presented itself&mdash;Was this the Helena, that a <lb/>
few hours before, was blithsome with health and radiant <lb/>
with beauty! Her visage was serene, but sunken and pale. <lb/>
Death was in every line of it. To his tremulous and <reg orig="hur-|ried">hurried</reg> <lb/>
scrutiny every limb was rigid and cold.</p>
<p>The habits of Ormond tended to obscure the appearances, <lb/>
if not to deaden the emotions of sorrow. He was so much <lb/>
accustomed to the frustration of well intended efforts, and <lb/>
confided so much in his own integrity, that he was not easily <lb/>
disconcerted. He had merely to advert, on this occasion, <lb/>
to the tumultuous state of his feelings, in order to banish their <lb/>
confusion and restore himself to calm. Well, said he, as he <lb/>
dropped the curtain and turned towards another part of the <lb/>
room, this, without doubt, is a rueful spectacle. Can it be <lb/>
helped? Is there in man the power of recalling her? <lb/>
There is none such in me.</p>
<p>She is gone. Well then, she <hi rend="italic">is</hi> gone. If she were fool <lb/>
enough to die, I am not fool enough to follow her. I am <lb/>
determined to live, and be happy notwithstanding. Why not?</p>
<p>Yet, this is a piteous sight. What is impossible to undo, <lb/>
might be easily prevented. A piteous spectacle! But what <lb/>
else, on an ampler scale, is the universe? Nature is a theatre <lb/>
of suffering. What corner is unvisited by calamity and <lb/>
pain? I have chosen as became me. I would rather <reg orig="pre-|cede">precede</reg> <lb/>
thee to the grave, than live to be thy husband.</p>
<p>Thou hast done my work for me. Thou hast saved <lb/>
thyself and me from a thousand evils. Thou hast acted as <lb/>
seemed to thee best, and I am satisfied.</p>
<p>Hast thou decided erroneously? They that know thee, <lb/>
need not marvel at that. Endless have been the proofs of <lb/>
<pb n="151" entity="eaf033v5_0164" pid="uva-lib:350430"/>
thy frailty. In favor of this last act, something may be said. <lb/>
It is the last thou wilt ever commit. Others only will <reg orig="expe-|rience">experience</reg> <lb/>
its effects; thou hast, at least, provided for thy own <lb/>
safety.</p>
<p>But what is here? A letter for me? Had thy <reg orig="under-|standing">understanding</reg> <lb/>
been as prompt as thy fingers, I could have borne <lb/>
with thee. I can easily divine the contents of this epistle.</p>
<p>He opened it, and found the tenor to be as follows:</p>
<p>"You did not use, my dear friend, to part with me in this <lb/>
manner. You never before treated me so roughly. I am <lb/>
sorry, indeed I am, that I ever offended you. Could you <lb/>
suppose that I intended it? And if you knew that I meant <lb/>
not offence, why did you take offence?</p>
<p>"I am very unhappy, for I have lost you, my friend. You <lb/>
will never see me more, you say. That is very hard. I <lb/>
have deserved it to be sure, but I do not know how it has <lb/>
happened. Nobody more desired to please than I have <lb/>
done. Morning, noon and night, it was my only study; but <lb/>
you will love me no more; you will see me no more. <reg orig="For-|give">Forgive</reg> <lb/>
me, my friend, but I must say it is very hard.</p>
<p>"You said rightly; I do not wish to live without my friend. <lb/>
I have spent my life happily, heretofore. 'Tis true, there have <lb/>
been transient uneasinesses, but your love was a reward and <lb/>
a cure for every thing. I desired nothing better in this <lb/>
world. Did you ever hear me murmur? No; I was not so <lb/>
unjust. My lot was happy, infinitely beyond my deserving. <lb/>
I merited not to be loved by you. O that I had suitable <lb/>
words to express my gratitude, for your kindness! but this <lb/>
last meeting&mdash;how different from that which went before? <lb/>
Yet even then, there was something on your brow like <lb/>
discontent, which I could not warble nor whisper away, as I <lb/>
used to do. But, sad as this was, it was nothing like the last.</p>
<p>"Could Ormond be so stern and so terrible? You knew <lb/>
that I would die, but you need not have talked as if I were <lb/>
in the way, and as if you had rather I should die than live. <lb/>
But one thing I rejoice at; I am a poor silly girl, but <reg orig="Con-|stantia">Constantia</reg> <lb/>
is a noble and accomplished one. Most joyfully do <lb/>
I resign you to her, my dear friend. You say you love her. <lb/>
She need not be afraid of accepting you. There will be no <lb/>
danger of your preferring another to her. It was very <reg orig="natu-|ral">natural</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="152" entity="eaf033v5_0165" pid="uva-lib:350431"/>
and very right for you to prefer her to me. She and <lb/>
you will be happy in each other. It is this that sweetens <lb/>
the cup I am going to drink. Never did I go to sleep, with <lb/>
more good will, than I now go to death. Fare you well, <lb/>
my dear friend."</p>
<p>This letter was calculated to make a deeper impression on <lb/>
Ormond, than even the sight of Helena's corpse. It was in <lb/>
vain, for some time, that he endeavored to reconcile <reg orig="him-|self">himself</reg> <lb/>
to this event. It was seldom that he was able to forget <lb/>
it. He was obliged to exert all his energies, to enable him <lb/>
to support the remembrance. The task was, of course, <lb/>
rendered easier by time.</p>
<p>It was immediately requisite to attend to the disposal of the <lb/>
corpse. He felt himself unfit for this mournful office. He <lb/>
was willing to relieve himself from it, by any expedient. <lb/>
Helena's next neighbor, was an old lady, whose scruples <lb/>
made her shun all direct intercourse with this unhappy girl; <lb/>
yet she had performed many acts of neighborly kindness. <lb/>
She readily obeyed the summons of Ormond, on this <reg orig="occa-|sion">occasion</reg>, <lb/>
to take charge of affairs, till another should assume it. <lb/>
Ormond returned home, and sent the following note to <lb/>
Constantia.</p>
<p>"You have predicted aright. Helena is dead. In a <lb/>
mind like yours every grief will be suspended, and every <lb/>
regard absorbed in the attention due to the remains of this <lb/>
unfortunate girl. <hi rend="italic">I</hi> cannot attend to them."</p>
<p>Constantia was extremely shocked by this intelligence, <lb/>
but she was not unmindful of her duty. She prepared <reg orig="her-|self">herself</reg> <lb/>
with mournful alacrity, for the performance of it. Every <lb/>
thing that the occasion demanded, was done with diligence <lb/>
and care. Till this was accomplished, Ormond could not <lb/>
prevail upon himself to appear upon the stage. He was <reg orig="in-|formed">informed</reg> <lb/>
of this by a note from Constantia, who requested <lb/>
him to take possession of the unoccupied dwelling and its <lb/>
furniture.</p>
<p>Among the terms of his contract with Helena, Ormond <lb/>
had voluntarily inserted the exclusive property of a house <lb/>
and its furniture in this city, with funds adequate to her <lb/>
<pb n="153" entity="eaf033v5_0166" pid="uva-lib:350432"/>
plentiful maintenance. These he had purchased and <reg orig="trans-|ferred">transferred</reg> <lb/>
to her. To this he had afterwards added a rural <lb/>
retreat, in the midst of spacious and well cultivated fields, <lb/>
three miles from Perth-Amboy, and seated on the right bank <lb/>
of the sound. It is proper to mention that this farm was <lb/>
formerly the property of Mr. Dudley; had been fitted up <lb/>
by him, and used as his summer abode during his prosperity. <lb/>
In the division of his property it had fallen to one of his <lb/>
creditors, from whom it had been purchased by Ormond. <lb/>
This circumstance, in conjunction with the love, which she <lb/>
bore to Constantia, had suggested to Helena a scheme, which <lb/>
her want of foresight would, in different circumstances, have <lb/>
occasioned her to overlook. It was that of making her <reg orig="tes-|tament">testament</reg>, <lb/>
by which she bequeathed all that she possessed to <lb/>
her friend. This was not done without the knowledge and <lb/>
cheerful concurrence of Ormond, who, together with <reg orig="Mel-|bourne">Melbourne</reg> <lb/>
and another respectable citizen, were named <reg orig="execu-|tors">executors</reg>. <lb/>
Melbourne and his friend were induced by their <reg orig="res-|pect">respect</reg> <lb/>
for Constantia, to consent to this nomination.</p>
<p>This had taken place before Ormond and Constantia had <lb/>
been introduced to each other. After this event, Ormond <lb/>
had sometimes been employed in contriving means for <reg orig="se-|curing">securing</reg> <lb/>
to his new friend and her father, a subsistence, more <lb/>
certain than the will of Helena could afford. Her death he <lb/>
considered as an event equally remote and undesirable. <lb/>
This event, however unexpectedly, had now happened, and <lb/>
precluded the necessity of further consideration on this head.</p>
<p>Constantia could not but accept this bequest. Had it <lb/>
been her wish to decline, it was not in her power, but she <lb/>
justly regarded the leisure and independence thus conferred <lb/>
upon her, as inestimable benefits. It was a source of <reg orig="un-|bounded">unbounded</reg> <lb/>
satisfaction on her father's account, who was once <lb/>
more seated in the bosom of affluence. Perhaps in a <reg orig="ra-|tional">rational</reg> <lb/>
estimate, one of the most fortunate events that could <lb/>
have befallen those persons, was that period of adversity <lb/>
through which they had been doomed to pass. Most of the <lb/>
defects that adhered to the character of Mr. Dudley, had, <lb/>
by this means, been exterminated. He was now cured of <lb/>
those prejudices which his early prosperity had instilled, and <lb/>
which had flowed from luxurious indulgences. He had <lb/>
<pb n="154" entity="eaf033v5_0167" pid="uva-lib:350433"/>
learned to estimate himself at his true value, and to <reg orig="sympa-|thize">sympathize</reg> <lb/>
with sufferings which he himself had partaken.</p>
<p>It was easy to perceive in what light Constantia was <reg orig="re-|garded">regarded</reg> <lb/>
by her father. He never reflected on his relation to <lb/>
her without rapture. Her qualities were the objects of his <lb/>
adoration. He resigned himself with pleasure to her <reg orig="gui-|dance">guidance</reg>. <lb/>
The chain of subordination and duties was reversed. <lb/>
By the ascendancy of her genius and wisdom, the province <lb/>
of protection and the tribute of homage, had devolved upon <lb/>
her. This had resulted from incessant experience of the <lb/>
wisdom of her measures, and the spectacle of her fortitude <lb/>
and skill in every emergency.</p>
<p>It seemed as if but one evil adhered to the condition of <lb/>
this man. His blindness was an impediment to knowledge <lb/>
and enjoyment, of which, the utmost to be hoped was, that <lb/>
he should regard it without pungent regret, and that he should <lb/>
sometimes forget it. That his mind should occasionally <lb/>
stray into foreign paths, and lose itself in sprightly <reg orig="conver-|sations">conversations</reg>, <lb/>
or benign reveries. This evil, however was, by no <lb/>
means remediless.</p>
<p>A surgeon of uncommon skill had lately arrived from <lb/>
Europe. He was one of the numerous agents and <reg orig="depend-|ents">dependents</reg> <lb/>
of Ormond, and had been engaged to abdicate his native <lb/>
country for purposes widely remote from his profession. <lb/>
The first use that was made of him, was to introduce him <lb/>
to Mr. Dudley. The diseased organs were critically <reg orig="exam-|ined">examined</reg>, <lb/>
and the patient was, with considerable difficulty, <reg orig="pre-|vailed">prevailed</reg> <lb/>
upon to undergo the necessary operation. His <reg orig="suc-|cess">success</reg> <lb/>
corresponded with Constantia's wishes, and her father <lb/>
was once more restored to the enjoyment of light.</p>
<p>These were auspicious events&mdash;Constantia held herself <lb/>
amply repaid by them, for all that she had suffered. These <reg orig="suf-|ferings">sufferings</reg> <lb/>
had indeed been light, when compared with the effects <lb/>
usually experienced by others in a similar condition. Her <lb/>
wisdom had extracted its sting from adversity, and without <lb/>
allowing herself to feel much of the evils of its reign, had <lb/>
employed it as an instrument by which the sum of her present <lb/>
happiness was increased. Few suffered less, in the midst <lb/>
of poverty, than she. No one ever extracted more felicity <lb/>
from the prosperous reverse.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XVIII.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">When</hi> time had somewhat mitigated the memory of the <lb/>
late disaster, the intercourse between Ormond and Constantia <lb/>
was renewed. The lady did not overlook her obligations to <lb/>
her friend. It was to him that she was indebted for her <lb/>
father's restoration to sight, and to whom both owed, <reg orig="essen-|tially">essentially</reg>, <lb/>
though indirectly, their present affluence. In her mind, <lb/>
gratitude was no perverse or ignoble principle. She viewed <lb/>
this man as the author of extensive benefits, of which her <lb/>
situation enabled her to judge with more accuracy than others. <lb/>
It created no bias on her judgment or, at least, none of <lb/>
which she was sensible. Her equity was perfectly <reg orig="unfetter-|ed">unfettered</reg>, <lb/>
and she decided in a way contrary to his inclination, <lb/>
with as little scruple as if the benefits had been received, <lb/>
not by herself, but by him. She, indeed, intended his <reg orig="ben-|efit">benefit</reg>, <lb/>
though she thwarted his inclinations.</p>
<p>She had few visitants besides himself. Their interviews <lb/>
were daily and unformal. The fate of Helena never <reg orig="pro-|duced">produced</reg> <lb/>
any reproaches on her part. She saw the <reg orig="useless-|ness">uselessness</reg> <lb/>
of recrimination, not only because she desired to <reg orig="pro-|duce">produce</reg> <lb/>
emotions different from those which invective is adapted <lb/>
to excite, but because it was more just to soothe than to <reg orig="ex-|asperate">exasperate</reg>, <lb/>
the inquietudes which haunted him.</p>
<p>She now enjoyed leisure. She had always been <reg orig="solicit-|ous">solicitous</reg> <lb/>
for mental improvement. Any means subservient to <lb/>
this end were valuable. The conversation of Ormond was <lb/>
an inexhaustible fund. By the variety of topics and the <lb/>
excitements to reflection it supplied, a more plenteous influx <lb/>
of knowledge was produced, than could have flowed from <lb/>
any other source. There was no end to the detailing of <lb/>
facts, and the canvassing of theories.</p>
<p>I have already said, that Ormond was engaged in schemes <lb/>
of an arduous and elevated nature. These were the <lb/>
topics of epistolary discussion between him and a certain <lb/>
number of coadjutors, in different parts of the world. In <lb/>
general discourse, it was proper to maintain a uniform <lb/>
silence respecting these, not only because they involved <reg orig="prin-|ciples">principles</reg> <lb/>
and views, remote from vulgar apprehension, but <lb/>
<pb n="156" entity="eaf033v5_0169" pid="uva-lib:350435"/>
because their success, in some measure, depended on their <lb/>
secrecy. He could not give a stronger proof of his <reg orig="confi-|dence">confidence</reg> <lb/>
in the sagacity and steadiness of Constantia than he <lb/>
now gave, by imparting to her his schemes, and requesting <lb/>
her advice and assistance in the progress of them.</p>
<p>His disclosures, however, were imperfect. What <reg orig="know-|ledge">knowledge</reg> <lb/>
was imparted, instead of appeasing, only tended to <lb/>
inflame her curiosity. His answers to her inquiries were <lb/>
prompt, and at first sight, sufficiently explicit, but upon <reg orig="re-|consideration">reconsideration</reg>, <lb/>
an obscurity seemed to gather round them, to <lb/>
be dispelled by new interrogatories. These, in like manner, <lb/>
effected a momentary purpose, but were sure speedily to <lb/>
lead into new conjectures, and re-immerse her in doubts. <lb/>
The task was always new, was always on the point of <lb/>
being finished, and always to be re-commenced.</p>
<p>Ormond aspired to nothing more ardently than to hold <lb/>
the reins of opinion. To exercise absolute power over the <lb/>
conduct of others, not by constraining their limbs, or by <lb/>
exacting obedience to his authority, but in a way of which <lb/>
his subjects should be scarcely conscious. He desired that <lb/>
his guidance should control their steps, but that his agency, <lb/>
when most effectual, should be least suspected.</p>
<p>If he were solicitous to govern the thoughts of Constantia, <lb/>
or to regulate her condition, the mode which he pursued had <lb/>
hitherto been admirably conducive to that end. To have <lb/>
found her friendless and indigent, accorded, with the most <lb/>
fortunate exactness, with his views. That she should have <lb/>
descended to this depth, from a prosperous height, and <lb/>
therefore be a stranger to the torpor which attends <reg orig="heredi-|tary">hereditary</reg> <lb/>
poverty, and be qualified rightly to estimate, and use <lb/>
the competence to which, by his means, she was now <reg orig="re-|stored">restored</reg>, <lb/>
was all that his providence would have prescribed.</p>
<p>Her thoughts were equally obsequious to his direction. <lb/>
The novelty and grandeur of his schemes could not fail to <lb/>
transport a mind, ardent and capacious as that of Constantia. <lb/>
Here his fortune had been no less propitious. He did <lb/>
not fail to discover, and was not slow to seize the <reg orig="advan-|tages">advantages</reg> <lb/>
flowing thence. By explaining his plans, opportunity <lb/>
was furnished to lead and to confine her meditations to <lb/>
the desirable tract. By adding fictitious embellishments, <lb/>
he adapted it with more exactness to his purpose. By <lb/>
<pb n="157" entity="eaf033v5_0170" pid="uva-lib:350436"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">14</fw></pb>
piece-meal and imperfect disclosures, her curiosity was kept <lb/>
alive.</p>
<p>I have described Ormond as having contracted a passion <lb/>
for Constantia. This passion certainly existed in his heart, <lb/>
but it must not be conceived to be immutable, or to operate <lb/>
independently of all those impulses and habits, which time <lb/>
had interwoven in his character. The person and affections <lb/>
of this woman, were the objects sought by him, and which <lb/>
it was the dearest purpose of his existence to gain. This <lb/>
was his supreme good, though the motives to which it was <lb/>
indebted for its pre-eminence in his imagination, were <reg orig="nume-|rous">numerous</reg> <lb/>
and complex.</p>
<p>I have enumerated his opinions on the subject of wedlock. <lb/>
The question will obviously occur, whether Constantia was <lb/>
sought by him, with upright or flagitious views. His <reg orig="senti-|ments">sentiments</reg> <lb/>
and resolutions, on this head, had for a time <reg orig="fluctu-|ated">fluctuated</reg>, <lb/>
but were now steadfast. Marriage was, in his eyes, <lb/>
hateful and absurd as ever. Constantia was to be obtained <lb/>
by any means. If other terms were rejected, he was willing, <lb/>
for the sake of this good, to accept her as a wife; but this <lb/>
was a choice to be made, only when every expedient was <reg orig="ex-|hausted">exhausted</reg>, <lb/>
for reconciling her to a compact of a different kind.</p>
<p>For this end, he prescribed to himself a path suited to <lb/>
the character of this lady. He made no secret of his <reg orig="senti-|ments">sentiments</reg> <lb/>
and views. He avowed his love, and described, <lb/>
without scruple, the scope of his wishes. He challenged <lb/>
her to confute his principles, and promised a candid <reg orig="audi-|ence">audience</reg> <lb/>
and profound consideration to her arguments. Her <lb/>
present opinions he knew to be adverse to his own, but he <lb/>
hoped to change them, by subtilty and perseverance. His <lb/>
further hopes and designs, he concealed from her. She <lb/>
was unaware, that if he were unable to effect a change in <lb/>
her creed, he was determined to adopt a system of <reg orig="impos-|ture">imposture</reg>. <lb/>
To assume the guise of a convert to her doctrines, <lb/>
and appear as devout as herself in his notions of the sanctity <lb/>
of marriage.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was not difficult, to have foreseen the <reg orig="conse-|quence">consequence</reg> <lb/>
of these projects. Constantia's peril was imminent. <lb/>
This arose not only from the talents and address of Ormond, <lb/>
but from the community of sentiment, which already existed <lb/>
<pb n="158" entity="eaf033v5_0171" pid="uva-lib:350437"/>
between them. She was unguarded in a point, where, if <lb/>
not her whole, yet, doubtless, her principal security and <lb/>
strongest bulwark would have existed. She was <reg orig="unac-|quainted">unacquainted</reg> <lb/>
with religion. She was unhabituated to conform <lb/>
herself to any standard, but that connected with the present <lb/>
life. Matrimonial, as well as every other human duty, was <lb/>
disconnected in her mind, with any awful or divine sanction. <lb/>
She formed her estimate of good and evil, on nothing but <lb/>
terrestrial and visible consequences.</p>
<p>This defect in her character, she owed to her father's <lb/>
system of education. Mr. Dudley was an adherent to what <lb/>
he conceived to be true religion. No man was more <reg orig="pas-|sionate">passionate</reg> <lb/>
in his eulogy of his own form of devotion and belief, <lb/>
or in his invectives against atheistical dogmas; but he <reg orig="re-|flected">reflected</reg> <lb/>
that religion assumed many forms, one only of which <lb/>
is salutary or true, and that truth in this respect, is <reg orig="incom-|patible">incompatible</reg> <lb/>
with infantile and premature instruction.</p>
<p>To this subject, it was requisite to apply the force of a <lb/>
mature and unfettered understanding. For this end he <reg orig="la-|bored">labored</reg> <lb/>
to lead away the juvenile reflections of Constantia, <lb/>
from religious topics, to detain them in the paths of history <lb/>
and eloquence. To accustom her to the accuracy of <reg orig="geo-|metrical">geometrical</reg> <lb/>
deduction, and to the view of those evils, that have <lb/>
flowed in all ages, from mistaken piety.</p>
<p>In consequence of this scheme, her habits rather than her <lb/>
opinions, were undevout. Religion was regarded by her, <lb/>
not with disbelief, but with absolute indifference. Her good <lb/>
sense forbade her to decide before inquiry, but her modes <lb/>
of study and reflection were foreign to, and unfitted her for, <lb/>
this species of discussion. Her mind was seldom called to <lb/>
meditate on this subject, and when it occurred, her <reg orig="percep-|tions">perceptions</reg> <lb/>
were vague and obscure. No objects, in the sphere <lb/>
which she occupied, were calculated to suggest to her the <lb/>
importance of investigation and certainty.</p>
<p>It becomes me to confess, however reluctantly, thus much <lb/>
concerning my friend. However abundantly endowed in <lb/>
other respects, she was a stranger to the felicity and <reg orig="excel-|lence">excellence</reg> <lb/>
flowing from religion. In her struggles with <reg orig="misfor-|tune">misfortune</reg>, <lb/>
she was supported and cheered by the sense of no <reg orig="ap-|probation">approbation</reg>, <lb/>
but her own. A defect of this nature will <reg orig="per-|haps">perhaps</reg> <lb/>
be regarded as of less moment, when her extreme <lb/>
<pb n="159" entity="eaf033v5_0172" pid="uva-lib:350438"/>
youth is remembered. All opinions in her mind were <reg orig="mu-|table">mutable</reg>, <lb/>
inasmuch as the progress of her understanding was <lb/>
incessant.</p>
<p>It was otherwise with Ormond. His disbelief was at <lb/>
once unchangeable and strenuous. The universe was to <lb/>
him a series of events, connected by an undesigning and <reg orig="in-|scrutable">inscrutable</reg> <lb/>
necessity, and an assemblage of forms, to which no <lb/>
beginning or end can be conceived. Instead of transient <lb/>
views and vague ideas, his meditations, on religious points, <lb/>
had been intense. Enthusiasm was added to disbelief, and <lb/>
he not only dissented but abhorred.</p>
<p>He deemed it prudent, however, to disguise sentiments, <lb/>
which, if unfolded in their full force, would wear to her the <lb/>
appearance of insanity. But he saw and was eager to <reg orig="im-|prove">improve</reg> <lb/>
the advantage, which his anti-nuptial creed derived <lb/>
from the unsettled state of her opinions. He was not <reg orig="una-|ware">unaware</reg>, <lb/>
likewise, of the auspicious and indispensable <reg orig="co-opera-|tion">co-operation</reg> <lb/>
of love. If this advocate were wanting in her bosom, <lb/>
all his efforts would be in vain. If this pleader were engaged <lb/>
in his behalf, he entertained no doubts of his ultimate <reg orig="suc-|cess">success</reg>. <lb/>
He conceived that her present situation, all whose <lb/>
comforts were the fruits of his beneficence, and which <reg orig="afford-|ed">afforded</reg> <lb/>
her no other subject of contemplation than himself, was <lb/>
as favorable as possible to the growth of this passion.</p>
<p>Constantia was acquainted with his wishes. She could <lb/>
not fail to see, that she might speedily be called upon to <reg orig="de-|termine">determine</reg> <lb/>
a momentous question. Her own sensations and <lb/>
the character of Ormond, were, therefore, scrutinized with <lb/>
suspicious attention. Marriage could be justified in her eyes, <lb/>
only by community of affections and opinions. She might <lb/>
love without the sanction of her judgment, but while <reg orig="desti-|tute">destitute</reg> <lb/>
of that sanction, she would never suffer it to sway her <lb/>
conduct.</p>
<p>Ormond was imperfectly known. What knowledge she <lb/>
had gained, flowed chiefly from his own lips, and was <reg orig="there-|fore">therefore</reg> <lb/>
unattended with certainty. What portion of deceit or <lb/>
disguise was mixed with his conversation, could be known, <lb/>
only by witnessing his actions with her own eyes, and <reg orig="com-|paring">comparing</reg> <lb/>
his testimony with that of others. He had embraced <lb/>
a multitude of opinions, which appeared to her erroneous. <lb/>
Till these were rectified, and their conclusions were made <lb/>
<pb n="160" entity="eaf033v5_0173" pid="uva-lib:350439"/>
to correspond, wedlock was improper. Some of these <reg orig="ob-|scurities">obscurities</reg> <lb/>
might be dispelled, and some of these discords be <lb/>
resolved into harmony by time. Meanwhile, it was proper <lb/>
to guard the avenues to her heart, and screen herself from <lb/>
self-delusion.</p>
<p>There was no motive to conceal her reflections, on this <lb/>
topic, from her father. Mr. Dudley discovered, without her <lb/>
assistance, the views of Ormond. His daughter's happiness <lb/>
was blended with his own. He lived, but in the <reg orig="conscious-|ness">consciousness</reg> <lb/>
of her tranquillity. Her image was seldom absent from <lb/>
his eyes, and never from his thoughts. The emotions which <lb/>
it excited, sprung but in part from the relationship of father. <lb/>
It was gratitude and veneration, which she claimed from him, <lb/>
and which filled him with rapture.</p>
<p>He ruminated deeply on the character of Ormond. The <lb/>
political and anti-theological tenets of this man were <reg orig="regard-|ed">regarded</reg>, <lb/>
not merely with disapprobation, but antipathy. He was <lb/>
not ungrateful for the benefits which had been conferred <reg orig="up-|on">upon</reg> <lb/>
him. Ormond's peculiarities of sentiment, excited no <reg orig="im-|patience">impatience</reg>, <lb/>
as long as he was regarded merely as a visitant. <lb/>
It was only as one claiming to possess his daughter, that his <lb/>
presence excited in Mr. Dudley, trepidation and loathing.</p>
<p>Ormond was unacquainted with what was passing in the <lb/>
mind of Mr. Dudley. The latter conceived his own <reg orig="bene-|factor">benefactor</reg> <lb/>
and his daughter's friend, to be entitled to the most <lb/>
scrupulous and affable urbanity. His objections to a nearer <lb/>
alliance were urged with frequent and pathetic vehemence, <lb/>
only in his private interviews with Constantia. Ormond and <lb/>
he seldom met; Mr. Dudley, as soon as his sight was <reg orig="per-|fectly">perfectly</reg> <lb/>
retrieved, betook himself with eagerness to painting, <lb/>
an amusement, which his late privations had only contributed <lb/>
to endear to him.</p>
<p>Things remained nearly on their present footing for some <lb/>
months. At the end of this period, some engagement <reg orig="oblig-|ed">obliged</reg> <lb/>
Ormond to leave the city. He promised to return with <lb/>
as much speed as circumstances would admit. Meanwhile <lb/>
his letters supplied her with topics of reflection. These <lb/>
were frequently received, and were models of that energy <lb/>
of style, which results from simplicity of structure, from <reg orig="pic-|turesque">picturesque</reg> <lb/>
epithets, and from the compression of much meaning <lb/>
into few words. His arguments seldom imparted conviction, <lb/>
<pb n="161" entity="eaf033v5_0174" pid="uva-lib:350440"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">14*</fw></pb>
but delight never failed to flow from their lucid order and <lb/>
cogent brevity. His narratives were unequalled for rapidity <lb/>
and comprehensiveness. Every sentence was a treasury to <lb/>
moralists and painters.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Domestic</hi> and studious occupations did not wholly <reg orig="en-|gross">engross</reg> <lb/>
the attention of Constantia. Social pleasures were <lb/>
precious to her heart, and she was not backward to form <lb/>
fellowships and friendships, with those around her. <reg orig="Hither-|to">Hitherto</reg> <lb/>
she had met with no one entitled to an uncommon portion <lb/>
of regard, or worthy to supply the place of the friend of her <lb/>
infancy. Her visits were rare, and as yet, chiefly confined <lb/>
to the family of Mr. Melbourne. Here she was treated <lb/>
with flattering distinctions, and enjoyed opportunities of <reg orig="ex-|tending">extending</reg> <lb/>
as far as she pleased, her connexions with the gay <lb/>
and opulent. To this she felt herself by no means inclined, <lb/>
and her life was still eminently distinguished by love of <reg orig="pri-|vacy">privacy</reg>, <lb/>
and habits of seclusion.</p>
<p>One morning, feeling an indisposition to abstraction, she <lb/>
determined to drop in, for an hour, on Mrs. Melbourne. <lb/>
Finding Mrs. Melbourne's parlor unoccupied, she proceeded <lb/>
unceremoniously, to an apartment on the second floor, <lb/>
where that lady was accustomed to sit. She entered, but <lb/>
this room was likewise empty. Here she cast her eyes on <lb/>
a collection of prints, copied from the Farnese collection, and <lb/>
employed herself, for some minutes, in comparing the forms <lb/>
of Titiano and the Caracchi.</p>
<p>Suddenly, notes of peculiar sweetness were wafted to her <lb/>
ear from without. She listened with surprise, for the tones <lb/>
of her father's lute were distinctly recognized. She hied <lb/>
to the window, which chanced to look into a back court. <lb/>
The music was perceived to come from the window of the <lb/>
next house. She recollected her interview with the <reg orig="pur-|chaser">purchaser</reg> <lb/>
of her instrument, at the musical shop, and the <reg orig="power-|ful">powerful</reg> <lb/>
impression which the stranger's countenance had made <lb/>
upon her.</p>
<pb n="162" entity="eaf033v5_0175" pid="uva-lib:350441"/>
<p>The first use she had made of her recent change of <reg orig="for-|tune">fortune</reg>, <lb/>
was to endeavor the recovery of this instrument. The <lb/>
musical dealer, when reminded of the purchase, and <reg orig="inter-|rogated">interrogated</reg> <lb/>
as to the practicability of regaining the lute, for <lb/>
which she was willing to give treble the price, answered <lb/>
that he had no knowledge of the foreign lady, beyond what <lb/>
was gained at the interview which took place in Constantia's <lb/>
presence. Of her name, residence, and condition, he knew <lb/>
nothing, and had endeavored in vain to acquire knowledge.</p>
<p>Now this incident seemed to have furnished her with the <lb/>
information she so earnestly sought. This performer was <lb/>
probably the stranger herself. Her residence so near the <lb/>
Melbournes, and in a house which was the property of the <lb/>
magistrate, might be means of information as to her <reg orig="condi-|tion">condition</reg>, <lb/>
and perhaps of introduction to a personal acquaintance.</p>
<p>While engaged in these reflections, Mrs. Melbourne <reg orig="en-|tered">entered</reg> <lb/>
the appartment. Constantia related this incident to <lb/>
her friend, and stated the motives of her present curiosity. <lb/>
Her friend willingly imparted what knowledge she possessed <lb/>
relative to this subject. This was the sum.</p>
<p>This house had been hired, previously to the appearance <lb/>
of yellow fever, by an English family, who left their native <lb/>
soil, with a view to a permanent abode in the new world. <lb/>
They had scarcely taken possession of the dwelling, when <lb/>
they were terrified by the progress of the epidemic. They <lb/>
had fled from the danger, but this circumstance, in addition <lb/>
to some others, induced them to change their scheme. An <lb/>
evil so unwonted as pestilence, impressed them with a belief <lb/>
of perpetual danger, as long as they remained on this side <lb/>
of the ocean. They prepared for an immediate return to <lb/>
England.</p>
<p>For this end their house was relinquished, and their <reg orig="splen-|did">splendid</reg> <lb/>
furniture destined to be sold by auction. Before this <lb/>
event could take place, application was made to Mr. <reg orig="Mel-|bourne">Melbourne</reg>, <lb/>
by a lady, whom his wife's description shewed to <lb/>
be the same with her of whom Constantia was in search. <lb/>
She not only rented the house, but negotiated by means of <lb/>
her landlord, the purchase of the furniture.</p>
<p>Her servants were blacks, and all but one, who officiated <lb/>
as steward, unacquainted with the English language. Some <lb/>
accident had proved her name to be Beauvais. She had <lb/>
<pb n="163" entity="eaf033v5_0176" pid="uva-lib:350442"/>
no visitants, very rarely walked abroad, and then only in <lb/>
the evening with a female servant in attendance. Her hours <lb/>
appeared to be divided between the lute and the pen. As <lb/>
to her previous history or her present sources of subsistence, <lb/>
Mrs. Melbourne's curiosity had not been idle, but no <reg orig="consist-|ent">consistent</reg> <lb/>
information was obtainable. Some incident had given <lb/>
birth to the conjecture, that she was wife, or daughter, or <lb/>
sister of Beauvais, the partizan of Brissot, whom the faction <lb/>
of Marat had lately consigned to the scaffold, but this <reg orig="con-|jecture">conjecture</reg> <lb/>
was unsupported by suitable evidence.</p>
<p>This tale by no means diminished Constantia's desire of <lb/>
personal intercourse. She saw no means of effecting her <lb/>
purpose. Mrs. Melbourne was unqualified to introduce her, <lb/>
having been discouraged in all the advances she had made <lb/>
towards a more friendly intercourse. Constantia reflected <lb/>
that her motives to seclusion, would probably induce this <lb/>
lady to treat others as her friend had been treated.</p>
<p>It was possible, however, to gain access to her, if not as <lb/>
a friend, yet as the original proprietor of the lute. She <reg orig="de-|termined">determined</reg> <lb/>
to employ the agency of Roseveldt, the musical <lb/>
shopman, for the purpose of re-buying this instrument. To <lb/>
enforce her application, she commissioned this person, whose <lb/>
obliging temper entitled him to confidence, to state her <reg orig="in-|ducements">inducements</reg> <lb/>
for originally offering it for sale, and her motives <lb/>
for desiring the repossession on any terms which the lady <lb/>
thought proper to dictate.</p>
<p>Roseveldt fixed an hour in which it was convenient for <lb/>
him to execute her commission. This hour having passed, <lb/>
Constantia, who was anxious respecting his success, <reg orig="hasten-|ed">hastened</reg> <lb/>
to his house. Roseveldt delivered the instrument, which <lb/>
the lady, having listened to his pleas and offers, directed to <lb/>
be gratuitously restored to Constantia. At first, she had <lb/>
expressed her resolution to part with it on no account, and <lb/>
at no price. Its music was her only recreation, and this <lb/>
instrument surpassed any she had ever before seen, in the <lb/>
costliness and delicacy of its workmanship. But Roseveldt's <lb/>
representations produced an instant change of resolution, <lb/>
and she not only eagerly consented to restore it, but refused <lb/>
to receive any thing in payment.</p>
<p>Constantia was deeply affected by this unexpected <reg orig="gen-|erosity">generosity</reg>. <lb/>
It was not her custom to be outstripped in this <lb/>
<pb n="164" entity="eaf033v5_0177" pid="uva-lib:350443"/>
career. She now condemned herself for her eagerness <lb/>
to regain this instrument. During her father's blindness, it <lb/>
was a powerful, because the only solace of his melancholy. <lb/>
Now he had no longer the same anxieties to encounter, and <lb/>
books and the pencil were means of gratification always at <lb/>
hand. The lute, therefore, she imagined, could be easily <lb/>
dispensed with by Mr. Dudley, whereas its power of <reg orig="con-|soling">consoling</reg> <lb/>
might be as useful to the unknown lady, as it had <reg orig="form-|erly">formerly</reg> <lb/>
been to her father. She readily perceived in what <lb/>
manner it became her to act. Roseveldt was commissioned <lb/>
to re-deliver the lute, and to intreat the lady's acceptance of <lb/>
it. The tender was received without hesitation, and <reg orig="Rose-|veldt">Roseveldt</reg> <lb/>
dismissed without any inquiry relative to Constantia.</p>
<p>These transactions were reflected on by Constantia with <lb/>
considerable earnestness. The conduct of the stranger, her <lb/>
affluent and lonely state, her conjectural relationship to the <lb/>
actors in the great theatre of Europe, were mingled together <lb/>
in the fancy of Constantia, and embellished with the <reg orig="concep-|tions">conceptions</reg> <lb/>
of her beauty, derived from their casual meeting at <lb/>
Roseveldt's. She forgot not their similitude in age and sex, <lb/>
and delighted to prolong the dream of future confidence <lb/>
and friendship to take place between them. Her heart <reg orig="sigh-|ed">sighed</reg> <lb/>
for a companion, fitted to partake in all her sympathies.</p>
<p>This strain, by being connected with the image of a <lb/>
being like herself, who had grown up with her from <reg orig="child-|hood">childhood</reg>, <lb/>
who had been entwined with her earliest affections, <lb/>
but from whom she had been severed from the period at <lb/>
which her father's misfortunes commenced, and of whose <lb/>
present condition she was wholly ignorant, was productive of <lb/>
the deepest melancholy. It filled her with excruciating, and <lb/>
for a time irremediable sadness. It formed a kind of <reg orig="parox-|ysm">paroxysm</reg>, <lb/>
which like some febrile affections, approach and retire <lb/>
without warning, and against the most vehement struggles.</p>
<p>In this mood, her fancy was thronged with recollections of <lb/>
scenes, in which her friend had sustained a part. Their <lb/>
last interview was commonly revived in her remembrance <lb/>
so forcibly, as almost to produce a lunatic conception of its <lb/>
reality. A ditty which they sung together on that occasion, <lb/>
flowed to her lips. If ever human tones were qualified to <lb/>
convey the whole soul, they were those of Constantia when <lb/>
she sung;&mdash;</p>
<pb n="165" entity="eaf033v5_0178" pid="uva-lib:350444"/>
<lg type="poem">
<l>The breeze awakes, the bark prepares,</l>
<l rend="indent">To waft me to a distant shore;</l>
<l>But far beyond this world of cares,</l>
<l rend="indent">We meet again to part no more.</l>
</lg>
<p>These fits were accustomed to approach and to vanish by <lb/>
degrees. They were transitory but not infrequent, and <lb/>
were pregnant with such agonizing tenderness, such <reg orig="heart-|breaking">heartbreaking</reg> <lb/>
sighs, and a flow of such bitter yet delicious tears, <lb/>
that it were not easily decided whether the pleasure or the <lb/>
pain surmounted. When symptoms of their coming were <lb/>
felt, she hastened into solitude, that the progress of her <reg orig="feel-|ings">feelings</reg> <lb/>
might endure no restraint.</p>
<p>On the evening of the day, on which the lute had been <lb/>
sent to the foreign lady, Constantia was alone in her <reg orig="cham-|ber">chamber</reg>, <lb/>
immersed in desponding thoughts. From these she <lb/>
was recalled by Fabian, her black servant, who announced <lb/>
a guest. She was loth to break off the thread of her <reg orig="pre-|sent">present</reg> <lb/>
meditations, and inquired with a tone of some <reg orig="impa-|tience">impatience</reg>, <lb/>
who was the guest? The servant was unable to tell; <lb/>
it was a young lady whom he had never before seen; she <lb/>
had opened for herself, and entered the parlor without <reg orig="pre-|vious">previous</reg> <lb/>
notice.</p>
<p>Constantia paused at this relation. Her thoughts had <reg orig="re-|cently">recently</reg> <lb/>
been fixed upon Sophia Westwyn. Since their <reg orig="part-|ing">parting</reg> <lb/>
four years before, she had heard no tidings of this <reg orig="wo-|man">woman</reg>. <lb/>
Her fears imagined no more probable cause of her <lb/>
friend's silence than her death. This, however, was <reg orig="uncer-|tain">uncertain</reg>. <lb/>
The question now occurred, and brought with it <lb/>
sensations that left her no power to move; was this the <lb/>
guest?</p>
<p>Her doubts were quickly dispelled, for the stranger, taking <lb/>
a light from the table, and not brooking the servant's delay, <lb/>
followed Fabian to the chamber of his mistress. She <reg orig="en-|tered">entered</reg> <lb/>
with careless freedom, and presented, to the astonished <lb/>
eyes of Constantia, the figure she had met at Roseveldt's, <lb/>
and the purchaser of her lute.</p>
<p>The stranger advanced towards her with quick steps, and <lb/>
mingling tones of benignity and sprightliness, said;&mdash;</p>
<p>I have come to perform a duty. I have received from <lb/>
you to-day a lute, that I valued almost as my best friend. <lb/>
To find another in America, would not, perhaps, be possible; <lb/>
<pb n="166" entity="eaf033v5_0179" pid="uva-lib:350445"/>
but, certainly, none equally superb and exquisite as this can <lb/>
be found. To shew how highly I esteem the gift, I have <lb/>
come in person to thank you for it.&mdash;There she stopped.</p>
<p>Constantia could not suddenly recover from the extreme <lb/>
surprise into which the unexpectedness of this meeting, had <lb/>
thrown her. She could scarcely sufficiently suppress this <lb/>
confusion, to enable her to reply to these rapid effusions of <lb/>
her visitant, who resumed, with augmented freedom;&mdash;</p>
<p>I came, as I said, to thank you, but, to say the truth, <lb/>
that was not all. I came likewise to see you. Having done <lb/>
my errand, I suppose I must go. I would fain stay longer <lb/>
and talk to you a little; will you give me lieve?</p>
<p>Constantia, scarcely retrieving her composure, stammered <lb/>
out a polite assent. They seated themselves, and the <reg orig="visit-|ant">visitant</reg>, <lb/>
pressing the hand which she had taken, proceeded in <lb/>
a strain so smooth, so flowing, sliding from grave to gay, <lb/>
blending vivacity with tenderness, interpreting Constantia's <lb/>
silence with so keen sagacity, and accounting for the <reg orig="singu-|larities">singularities</reg> <lb/>
of her own deportment, in a way so respectful to her <lb/>
companion, and so worthy of a steadfast and pure mind in <lb/>
herself, that every embarrassment and scruple, were quickly <lb/>
banished from their interview.</p>
<p>In an hour the guest took her leave. No promise of <reg orig="re-|peating">repeating</reg> <lb/>
her visit, and no request that Constantia would <reg orig="re-|pay">repay</reg> <lb/>
it, was made. Their parting seemed to be the last; <lb/>
whatever purpose having been contemplated, appeared to be <lb/>
accomplished by this transient meeting. It was of a nature <lb/>
deeply to interest the mind of Constantia. This was the <lb/>
lady who talked with Roseveldt, and bargained with <reg orig="Mel-|bourne">Melbourne</reg>, <lb/>
and they had been induced by appearances, to <reg orig="sup-|pose">suppose</reg> <lb/>
her ignorant of any language but French; but her <lb/>
discourse, on the present occasion, was in English, and was <lb/>
distinguished by unrivalled fluency. Her phrases and habits <lb/>
of pronouncing, were untinctured with any foreign mixture, <lb/>
and bespoke the perfect knowledge of a native of America.</p>
<p>On the next evening, while Constantia was reviewing this <lb/>
transaction, calling up and weighing the sentiments which <lb/>
the stranger had uttered, and indulging some regret at the <lb/>
unlikelihood of their again meeting, Martinette, (for I will <lb/>
henceforth call her by her true name,) entered the <reg orig="apart-|ment">apartment</reg> <lb/>
as abruptly as before. She accounted for the visit, <lb/>
<pb n="167" entity="eaf033v5_0180" pid="uva-lib:350446"/>
merely by the pleasure it afforded her, and proceeded in a <lb/>
strain even more versatile and brilliant, than before. This <lb/>
interview ended like the first, without any tokens, on the <lb/>
part of the guest, of resolution or desire to renew it, but a <lb/>
third interview took place on the ensuing day.</p>
<p>Henceforth Martinette became a frequent but hasty <reg orig="visit-|ant">visitant</reg>, <lb/>
and Constantia became daily more enamored of her new <lb/>
acquaintance. She did not overlook peculiarities in the <reg orig="con-|versation">conversation</reg> <lb/>
and deportment of this woman. These exhibited <lb/>
no tendencies to confidence, or traces of sympathy. They <lb/>
merely denoted large experience, vigorous faculties and <reg orig="mas-|culine">masculine</reg> <lb/>
attaimnents. Herself was never introduced, except <lb/>
as an observer, but her observations, on government and <lb/>
manners, were profound and critical.</p>
<p>Her education seemed not widely different, from that <lb/>
which Constantia had received. It was classical and <reg orig="math-|ematical">mathematical</reg>, <lb/>
but to this was added a knowledge of political and <lb/>
military transactions in Europe, during the present age, <lb/>
which implied the possession of better means of information, <lb/>
than books. She depicted scenes and characters, with the <lb/>
accuracy of one who had partaken and witnessed them <reg orig="her-|self">herself</reg>.</p>
<p>Constantia's attention had been chiefly occupied by <reg orig="per-|sonal">personal</reg> <lb/>
concerns. Her youth had passed in contention with <lb/>
misfortune, or in the quietudes of study. She could not be <lb/>
unapprised of contemporary revolutions and wars, but her <lb/>
ideas respecting them were indefinite and vague. Her <lb/>
views and her inferences on this head, were general and <lb/>
speculative. Her acquaintance with history was exact and <lb/>
circumstantial, in proportion as she retired backward from <lb/>
her own age. She knew more of the siege of Mutina than <lb/>
of that of Lisle; more of the machinations of Cataline and <lb/>
the tumults of Clodius, than of the prostration of the Bastile, <lb/>
and the proscriptions of Marat.</p>
<p>She listened, therefore, with unspeakable eagerness to <lb/>
this reciter, who detailed to her, as the occasion suggested, <lb/>
the progress of action and opinion, on the theatre of France <lb/>
and Poland. Conceived and rehearsed as this was, with <lb/>
the energy and copiousness of one who sustained a part in <lb/>
the scene, the mind of Constantia was always kept at the <lb/>
pitch of curiosity and wonder.</p>
<pb n="168" entity="eaf033v5_0181" pid="uva-lib:350447"/>
<p>But while this historian described the features, personal <lb/>
deportment, and domestic character of Antoinette, Mirabeau <lb/>
and Robespierre, an impenetrable veil was drawn over her <lb/>
own condition. There was a warmth and freedom in her <lb/>
details, which bespoke her own co-agency in these events, <lb/>
but was unattended by transports of indignation or sorrow, or <lb/>
by pauses of abstraction, such as were likely to occur in one <lb/>
whose hopes and fears had been intimately blended with <lb/>
public events.</p>
<p>Constantia could not but derive humiliation from <reg orig="compar-|ing">comparing</reg> <lb/>
her own slender acquirements with those of her <reg orig="compan-|ion">companion</reg>. <lb/>
She was sensible that all the differences between <lb/>
them, arose from diversities of situation. She was eager to <lb/>
discover in what particulars this diversity consisted. She <lb/>
was for a time withheld by scruples, not easily explained, <lb/>
from disclosing her wishes. An accident however occurred, <lb/>
to remove these impediments. One evening, this <reg orig="uncere-|monious">unceremonious</reg> <lb/>
visitant discovered Constantia busily surveying a <lb/>
chart of the Mediterranean sea. This circumstance led the <lb/>
discourse to the present state of Syria and Cyprus. <reg orig="Marti-|nette">Martinette</reg> <lb/>
was copious in her details. Constantia listened for a <lb/>
time, and when a pause ensued, questioned her companion <lb/>
as to the means she possessed of acquiring so much <reg orig="know-|ledge">knowledge</reg>. <lb/>
This question was proposed with diffidence, and <lb/>
prefaced by apologies.</p>
<p>Instead of being offended by your question, replied the <lb/>
guest, I only wonder that it never before occurred to you. <lb/>
Travellers tell us much. Volney and Mariti would have <lb/>
told you nearly all that I have told. With these I have <reg orig="con-|versed">conversed</reg> <lb/>
personally, as well as read their books, but my <reg orig="know-|ledge">knowledge</reg> <lb/>
is, in truth, a species of patrimony. I inherit it.</p>
<p>Will you be good enough, said Constantia, to explain <lb/>
yourself?</p>
<p>My mother was a Greek of Cyprus. My father was a <lb/>
Sclavonian of Ragusa, and I was born in a garden at <lb/>
Aleppo.</p>
<p>That was a singular concurrence.</p>
<p>How singular? That a nautical vagrant like my father, <lb/>
should sometimes anchor in the bay of Naples. That a <lb/>
Cyprian merchant should carry his property and daughter <lb/>
beyond the reach of a Turkish Sangiack, and seek an <reg orig="asy-|lum">asylum</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="169" entity="eaf033v5_0182" pid="uva-lib:350448"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">15</fw></pb>
so commodious as Napoli; that my father should have <lb/>
dealings with this merchant, see, love, and marry his <reg orig="daugh-|ter">daughter</reg>, <lb/>
and afterwards procure, from the French government, a <lb/>
consular commission to Aleppo; that the union should, in <lb/>
due time, be productive of a son and daughter, are events <lb/>
far from being singular. They happen daily.</p>
<p>And may I venture to ask if this be your history?</p>
<p>The history of my parents. I hope you do not consider <lb/>
the place of my birth as the sole or the most important <reg orig="cir-|cumstance">circumstance</reg> <lb/>
of my life.</p>
<p>Nothing would please me more than to be enabled to <lb/>
compare it with other incidents. I am apt to think that <lb/>
your life is a tissue of surprising events. That the <reg orig="daugh-|ter">daughter</reg> <lb/>
of a Ragusan and Greek, should have seen and known <lb/>
so much; that she should talk English with equal fluency <lb/>
and more correctness than a native; that I should now be <lb/>
conversing with her in a corner so remote from Cyprus and <lb/>
Sicily, are events more wonderful than any which I have <lb/>
known.</p>
<p>Wonderful! Pish! Thy ignorance, thy miscalculation <lb/>
of probabilities is far more so. My father talked to me <lb/>
in Sclavonic. My mother and her maids talked to me <lb/>
in Greek. My neighbors talked to me in a medley of <lb/>
Arabic, Syriac and Turkish. My father's secretary was <lb/>
a scholar. He was as well versed in Lysias and <reg orig="Xen-|ophon">Xenophon</reg>, <lb/>
as any of their contemporaries. He labored for <lb/>
ten years to enable me to read a language, essentially the <lb/>
same with that I used daily to my nurse and mother. Is it <lb/>
wonderful then that I should be skilful in Sclavonic, Greek, <lb/>
and the jargon of Aleppo? To have refrained from learning <lb/>
was impossible. Suppose a girl, prompt, diligent, <reg orig="inquisi-|tive">inquisitive</reg>, <lb/>
to spend ten years of her life partly in Spain; partly in <lb/>
Tuscany; partly in France, and partly in England. With <lb/>
her versatile curiosity and flexible organs, would it be <reg orig="possi-|ble">possible</reg> <lb/>
for her to remain ignorant of each of these languages? <lb/>
Latin is the mother of them all, and presents itself, of <lb/>
course, to her studious attention.</p>
<p>I cannot easily conceive motives which should lead you, <lb/>
before the age of twenty, through so many scenes.</p>
<p>Can you not? You grew and flourished, like a frail <reg orig="Mi-|mosa">Mimosa</reg>, <lb/>
in the spot where destiny had planted you. Thank <lb/>
<pb n="170" entity="eaf033v5_0183" pid="uva-lib:350449"/>
my stars, I am somewhat better than a vegetable. <reg orig="Neces-|sity">Necessity</reg>, <lb/>
it is true, and not choice, set me in motion, but I am <lb/>
not sorry for the consequences.</p>
<p>Is it too much, said Constantia, with some hesitation, to <lb/>
request a detail of your youthful adventures?</p>
<p>Too much to give, perhaps, at a short notice. To such <lb/>
as you, my tale might abound with novelty, while to others, <lb/>
more acquainted with vicissitudes, it would be tedious and <lb/>
flat. I must be gone in a few minutes. For that and for <lb/>
better reasons, I must not be minute. A summary, at <reg orig="pres-|ent">present</reg>, <lb/>
will enable you to judge how far a more copious <reg orig="narra-|tive">narrative</reg> <lb/>
is suited to instruct or to please you.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XX.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">My</hi> father, in proportion as he grew old and rich, became <lb/>
weary of Aleppo. His natal soil, had it been the haunt of <lb/>
Calmucks or Bedwins, his fancy would have transformed <reg orig="in-|to">into</reg> <lb/>
Paradise. No wonder that the equitable aristocracy, and <lb/>
the peaceful husbandmen of Ragusa, should be endeared to <lb/>
his heart by comparison with Egyptian plagues and Turkish <lb/>
tyranny. Besides, he lived for his children as well as <reg orig="him-|self">himself</reg>. <lb/>
Their education and future lot required him to seek a <lb/>
permanent home.</p>
<p>He embarked with his wife and offspring, at Scanderoon. <lb/>
No immediate conveyance to Ragusa offering, the <reg orig="appear-|ance">appearance</reg> <lb/>
of the plague in Syria, induced him to hasten his <reg orig="de-|parture">departure</reg>. <lb/>
He entered a French vessel for Marseilles. After <lb/>
being three days at sea, one of the crew was seized by the <lb/>
fatal disease, which had depopulated all the towns upon the <lb/>
coast. The voyage was made with more than usual despatch, <lb/>
but before we reached our port, my mother and half the <lb/>
crew perished. My father died in the Lazzaretto, more <lb/>
through grief than disease.</p>
<p>My brother and I were children and helpless. My father's <lb/>
fortune was on board this vessel, and was left by his death <lb/>
to the mercy of the captain. This man was honest, and <lb/>
consigned us and our property to the merchant with whom <lb/>
<pb n="171" entity="eaf033v5_0184" pid="uva-lib:350450"/>
he dealt. Happily for us, our protector was childless and <lb/>
of scrupulous integrity. We henceforth became his <reg orig="adopt-|ed">adopted</reg> <lb/>
children. My brother's education and my own, were <lb/>
conducted on the justest principles.</p>
<p>At the end of four years, our protector found it expedient <lb/>
to make a voyage to Cayenne. His brother was an <reg orig="exten-|sive">extensive</reg> <lb/>
proprietor in that colony, but his sudden death made <lb/>
way for the succession of our friend. To establish his <lb/>
claims, his presence was necessary on the spot. He was <reg orig="lit-|tle">little</reg> <lb/>
qualified for arduous enterprises, and his age demanded <lb/>
repose, but his own acquisitions, having been small, and <reg orig="be-|ing">being</reg> <lb/>
desirous of leaving us in possession of competence, he <lb/>
cheerfully embarked.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, my brother was placed at a celebrated <reg orig="semi-|nary">seminary</reg> <lb/>
in the Pais de Vaud, and I was sent to a sister who <lb/>
resided at Verona. I was at this time fourteen years old, <lb/>
one year younger than my brother, whom, since that period, <lb/>
I have neither heard of nor seen.</p>
<p>I was now a woman, and qualified to judge and act for <lb/>
myself. The character of my new friend was austere and <reg orig="de-|vout">devout</reg>, <lb/>
and there were so many incongenial points between us, <lb/>
that but little tranquillity was enjoyed under her control. <lb/>
The priest who discharged the office of her confessor, thought <lb/>
proper to entertain views with regard to me, grossly <reg orig="incon-|sistent">inconsistent</reg> <lb/>
with the sanctity of his profession. He was a man <lb/>
of profound dissimulation and masterly address. His efforts, <lb/>
however, were repelled with disdain. My security against <lb/>
his attempts lay in the uncouthness and deformity which <reg orig="na-|ture">nature</reg> <lb/>
had bestowed upon his person and visage, rather than <lb/>
in the firmness of my own principles.</p>
<p>The courtship of Father Bartoli, the austerities of Madame <lb/>
Roselli, the disgustful or insipid occupations to which I was <lb/>
condemned, made me impatiently wish for a change, but my <lb/>
father, so I will call him, had decreed that I should remain <lb/>
under his sister's guardianship till his return from Guiana. <lb/>
When this would happen was uncertain. Events unforeseer <lb/>
might protract it for years, but it could not arrive in less than <lb/>
a twelvemonth.</p>
<p>I was incessantly preyed upon by discontent. My <reg orig="soli-|tude">solitude</reg> <lb/>
was loathsome. I panted after liberty and friendship, <lb/>
and the want of these were not recompensed by luxury and <lb/>
<pb n="172" entity="eaf033v5_0185" pid="uva-lib:350451"/>
quiet, and by the instructions in useful science, which I <reg orig="re-|ceived">received</reg> <lb/>
from Bartoli, who, though detested as a hypocrite <lb/>
and lover, was venerable as a scholar. He would fain have <lb/>
been an Ahelard, but it was not his fate to meet with an <reg orig="He-|loise">Heloise</reg>.</p>
<p>Two years passed away in this durance. My miseries <lb/>
were exquisite. I am almost at a loss to account for the <lb/>
unhappiness of that time, for looking back upon it, I perceive <lb/>
that an equal period could not have been spent with more <lb/>
benefit. For the sake of being near me, Bartoli <reg orig="impor-|tunately">importunately</reg> <lb/>
offered his instructions. He had nothing to <reg orig="com-|municate">communicate</reg> <lb/>
but metaphysics and geometry. These were little <lb/>
to my taste, but I could not keep him at distance. I had <lb/>
no other alternative than to endure him as a lover or a <reg orig="teach-|er">teacher</reg>. <lb/>
His passion for science was at least equal to that which <lb/>
he entertained for me, and both these passions combined to <lb/>
make him a sedulous instructer. He was a disciple of the <lb/>
newest doctrines respecting matter and mind. He denied <lb/>
the impenetrability of the first, and the immateriality of the <lb/>
second. These he endeavored to inculcate upon me, as <lb/>
well as to subvert my religious tenets, because he delighted, <lb/>
like all men, in transfusing his opinions, and because he <reg orig="re-|garded">regarded</reg> <lb/>
my piety as the only obstacle to his designs. He <lb/>
succeeded in dissolving the spell of ignorance, but not in <reg orig="pro-|ducing">producing</reg> <lb/>
that kind of acquiescence he wished. He had, in <lb/>
this respect, to struggle not only with my principles, but my <lb/>
weakness. He might have overcome every obstacle, but <lb/>
my abhorrence of deformity and age. To cure me of this <lb/>
aversion was beyond his power. My servitude grew daily <lb/>
more painful. I grew tired of chasing a comet to its <reg orig="aphe-|lion">aphelion</reg>, <lb/>
and of untying the knot of an infinite series. A <lb/>
change in my condition became indispensable to my very <lb/>
existence. Languor and sadness, and unwillingness to eat or <lb/>
to move, were at last my perpetual attendants.</p>
<p>Madame Roselli was alarmed at my condition. The <lb/>
sources of my inquietude were incomprehensible to her. <lb/>
The truth was, that I scarcely understood them myself, and <lb/>
my endeavors to explain them to my friend, merely <reg orig="instill-|ed">instilled</reg> <lb/>
into her an opinion, that I was either lunatic or deceitful. <lb/>
She complained and admonished, but my disinclination to my <lb/>
usual employments would not be conquered, and my health <lb/>
<pb n="173" entity="eaf033v5_0186" pid="uva-lib:350452"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">15*</fw></pb>
rapidly declined. A physician, who was called, confessed <lb/>
that my case was beyond his power to understand, but <reg orig="re-|commended">recommended</reg>, <lb/>
as a sort of desperate expedient, a change of <lb/>
scene. A succession and variety of objects might possibly <lb/>
contribute to my cure.</p>
<p>At this time there arrived at Verona, Lady D'Arcy, an <lb/>
English woman of fortune and rank, and a strenuous <reg orig="Cath-|olic">Catholic</reg>. <lb/>
Her husband had lately died, and in order to divert <lb/>
her grief, as well as to gratify her curiosity in viewing the <lb/>
great seat of her religion, she had come to Italy. <reg orig="Inter-|course">Intercourse</reg> <lb/>
took place between her and Madame Roselli. By <lb/>
this means she gained a knowledge of my person and <reg orig="condi-|tion">condition</reg>, <lb/>
and kindly offered to take me under her protection. <lb/>
She meant to traverse every part of Italy, and was willing <lb/>
that I should accompany her in all her wanderings.</p>
<p>This offer was gratefully accepted, in spite of the artifices <lb/>
and remonstrances of Bartoli. My companion speedily <reg orig="con-|tracted">contracted</reg> <lb/>
for me the affection of a mother. She was without <lb/>
kindred of her own religion, having acquired her faith, not <lb/>
by inheritance, but conversion. She desired to abjure her <lb/>
native country, and to bind herself by every social tie, to a <lb/>
people who adhered to the same faith. Me, she promised <lb/>
to adopt as her daughter, provided her first impressions in <lb/>
my favor, were not belied by my future deportment.</p>
<p>My principles were opposite to her's, but habit, an <reg orig="aver-|sion">aversion</reg> <lb/>
to displease my friend, my passion for knowledge, which <lb/>
my new condition enabled me to gratify, all combined to <lb/>
make me a deceiver, but my imposture was merely of a <lb/>
negative kind; I deceived her rather by forbearance to <reg orig="con-|tradict">contradict</reg>, <lb/>
and by acting as she acted, than by open assent and <lb/>
zealous concurrence. My new state was, on this account, <lb/>
not devoid of inconvenience. The general deportment and <lb/>
sentiments of Lady D'Arcy, testified a vigorous and pure <lb/>
mind. New avenues to knowledge, by converse with <reg orig="man-|kind">mankind</reg> <lb/>
and with books, and by the survey of new scenes, <lb/>
were open for my use. Gratitude and veneration attached <lb/>
me to my friend, and made the task of pleasing her, by a <lb/>
seeming conformity of sentiments, less irksome.</p>
<p>During this interval, no tidings were received by his sister, <lb/>
at Verona, respecting the fate of Sebastian Roselli. The <lb/>
<pb n="174" entity="eaf033v5_0187" pid="uva-lib:350453"/>
supposition of his death, was too plausible, not to be <reg orig="adopt-|ed">adopted</reg>. <lb/>
What influence this disaster possessed over my <reg orig="bro-|ther's">brother's</reg> <lb/>
destiny, I know not. The generosity of Lady D' Arcy, <lb/>
hindered me from experiencing any disadvantage from this <lb/>
circumstance. Fortune seemed to have decreed, that I <lb/>
should not be reduced to the condition of an orphan.</p>
<p>At an age and in a situation like mine, I could not remain <lb/>
long unacquainted with love. My abode at Rome, <reg orig="intro-|duced">introduced</reg> <lb/>
me to the knowledge of a youth from England, who <lb/>
had every property which I regarded as worthy of esteem. <lb/>
He was a kinsman of Lady D'Arcy, and as such admitted <lb/>
at her house on the most familiar footing. His patrimony <lb/>
was extremely slender, but was in his own possession. He <lb/>
had no intention of increasing it by any professional pursuit, <lb/>
but was contented with the frugal provision it afforded. He <lb/>
proposed no other end of his existence, than the acquisition <lb/>
of virtue and knowledge.</p>
<p>The property of Lady D' Arcy was subject to her own <lb/>
disposal, but, on the failure of a testamant, this youth was, <lb/>
in legal succession, the next heir. He was well acquainted <lb/>
with her temper and views, but in the midst of urbanity <lb/>
and gentleness, studied none of those concealments of <reg orig="opin-|ion">opinion</reg>, <lb/>
which would have secured him her favor. That he <lb/>
was not of her own faith, was an insuperable, but the only <lb/>
obstacle, to the admission of his claims.</p>
<p>If conformity of age and opinions, and the mutual <reg orig="fasci-|nation">fascination</reg> <lb/>
of love, be a suitable basis for marriage, Wentworth <lb/>
and I were destined for each other. Mutual disclosure <reg orig="add-|ed">added</reg> <lb/>
sanctity to our affection, but the happiness of Lady <lb/>
D' Arcy, being made to depend upon the dissolution of our <lb/>
compact, the heroism of Wentworth made him hasten to <lb/>
dissolve it. As soon as she discovered our attachment, she <lb/>
displayed symptoms of the deepest anguish. In addition <lb/>
to religious motives, her fondness for me forbade her to exist <lb/>
but in my society, and in the belief of the purity of my <lb/>
faith. The contention, on my part, was vehement, between <lb/>
the regards due to her felicity and to my own. Had <reg orig="Went-|worth">Wentworth</reg> <lb/>
left me the power to decide, my decision would <reg orig="doubt-|less">doubtless</reg> <lb/>
have evinced the frailty of my fortitude, and the strength <lb/>
of my passion, but having informed me fully of the reasons <lb/>
of his conduct, he precipitately retired from Rome. He <lb/>
<pb n="175" entity="eaf033v5_0188" pid="uva-lib:350454"/>
left me no means of tracing his footsteps and of assailing <lb/>
his weakness, by expostulation and entreaty.</p>
<p>Lady D'Arcy was no less eager to abandon a spot, where <lb/>
her happiness had been so imminently endangered. Our next <lb/>
residence was Palermo. I will not dwell upon the <reg orig="sensa-|tions">sensations</reg>, <lb/>
produced by this disappointment, in me. I review <lb/>
them with astonishment and self-compassion. If I thought <lb/>
it possible for me to sink again into imbecility so ignominious, <lb/>
I should be disposed to kill myself.</p>
<p>There was no end to vows of fondness and tokens of <lb/>
gratitude in Lady D'Arcy. Her future life should be <reg orig="de-|voted">devoted</reg> <lb/>
to compensate me for this sacrifice. Nothing could <lb/>
console her in that single state in which she intended to live, <lb/>
but the consolations of my fellowship. Her conduct <reg orig="coin-|cided">coincided</reg> <lb/>
for some time with these professions, and my anguish <lb/>
was allayed by the contemplation of the happiness conferred <lb/>
upon one whom I revered.</p>
<p>My friend could not be charged with dissimulation and <lb/>
artifice. Her character had been mistaken by herself as <lb/>
well as by me. Devout affections seemed to have filled <lb/>
her heart, to the exclusion of any object besides myself. <lb/>
She cherished with romantic tenderness, the memory of her <lb/>
husband, and imagined that a single state was indispensably <lb/>
enjoined upon her, by religious duty. This persuasion, <reg orig="how-|ever">however</reg>, <lb/>
was subverted by the arts of a Spanish Cavalier, young, <lb/>
opulent, and romantic as herself in devotion. An event <lb/>
like this might, indeed, have been easily predicted, by those <lb/>
who reflected that the lady was still in the bloom of life, <lb/>
ardent in her temper and bewitching in her manners.</p>
<p>The fondness she had lavished upon me, was now, in <lb/>
some degree, transferred to a new object, but I still received <lb/>
the treatment due to a beloved daughter. She was solicitous <lb/>
as ever to promote my gratification, and a diminution of <lb/>
kindness would not have been suspected, by those who had <lb/>
not witnessed the excesses of her former passion. Her <lb/>
marriage with the Spaniard removed the obstacle to union <lb/>
with Wentworth. This man, however, had set himself <reg orig="be-|yond">beyond</reg> <lb/>
the reach of my inquiries. Had there been the <reg orig="shad-|ow">shadow</reg> <lb/>
of a clue afforded, me I should certainly have sought <lb/>
him to the ends of the world.</p>
<pb n="176" entity="eaf033v5_0189" pid="uva-lib:350455"/>
<p>I continued to reside with my friend, and accompanied <lb/>
her and her husband to Spain. Antonio de Leyva was a <lb/>
man of probity. His mind was enlightened by knowledge <lb/>
and his actions dictated by humanity. Though but little <lb/>
older than myself, and young enough to be the son of his <lb/>
spouse, his deportment to me was a model of rectitude and <lb/>
delicacy. I spent a year in Spain, partly in the mountains <lb/>
of Castile and partly at Segovia. New manners and a new <lb/>
language occupied my attention for a time, but these, losing <lb/>
their novelty, lost their power to please. I betook myself to <lb/>
books, to beguile the tediousness and diversify the tenor of <lb/>
my life.</p>
<p>This would not have long availed, but I was relieved from <lb/>
new repinings, by the appointment of Antonio de Leyva to <lb/>
a diplomatic office at Vienna. Thither we accordingly <reg orig="re-|paired">repaired</reg>. <lb/>
A coincidence of circumstances had led me wide <lb/>
from the path of ambition and study, usually allotted to my <lb/>
sex and age. From the computation of eclipses, I now <lb/>
betook myself to the study of man. My proficiency, when <lb/>
I allowed it to be seen, attracted great attention. Instead <lb/>
of adulation and gallantry, I was engaged in watching the <lb/>
conduct of states, and revolving the theories of politicians.</p>
<p>Superficial observers were either incredulous with regard <lb/>
to my character, or connected a stupid wonder with their <lb/>
belief. My attainments and habits, they did not see to be <lb/>
perfectly consonant with the principles of human nature. <lb/>
They unavoidably flowed from the illicit attachment of <reg orig="Bar-|toli">Bartoli</reg>, <lb/>
and the erring magnanimity of Wentworth. Aversion <lb/>
to the priest was the grand inciter of my former studies; the <lb/>
love of Wentworth, whom I hoped once more to meet, made <lb/>
me labor to exclude the importunities of others, and to <lb/>
qualify myself for securing his affections.</p>
<p>Since our parting in Italy, Wentworth had traversed Syria <lb/>
and Egypt, and arrived some months after me at Vienna. <lb/>
He was on the point of leaving the city, when accident <reg orig="in-|formed">informed</reg> <lb/>
me of his being there. An interview was effected, <lb/>
and our former sentiments respecting each other, having <lb/>
undergone no change, we were united. Madame de <reg orig="Ley-|va">Leyva</reg> <lb/>
reluctantly concurred with our wishes, and, at parting, <lb/>
forced upon me a considerable sum of money.</p>
<pb n="177" entity="eaf033v5_0190" pid="uva-lib:350456"/>
<p>Wentworth's was a character not frequently met with <lb/>
in the world. He was a political enthusiast, who <reg orig="es-|teemed">esteemed</reg> <lb/>
nothing more graceful or glorious than to die for the <lb/>
liberties of mankind. He had traversed Greece with an <reg orig="im-|agination">imagination</reg> <lb/>
full of the exploits of ancient times, and derived, <lb/>
from contemplating Thermopyl&aelig; and Marathon, an <reg orig="enthusi-|asm">enthusiasm</reg> <lb/>
that bordered upon phrenzy.</p>
<p>It was now the third year of the revolutionary war in <lb/>
America, and previous to our meeting at Vienna, he had <lb/>
formed the resolution of repairing thither, and tendering his <lb/>
service to the Congress as a volunteer. Our marriage made <lb/>
no change in his plans. My soul was engrossed by two <lb/>
passions, a wild spirit of adventure, and a boundless <reg orig="devo-|tion">devotion</reg> <lb/>
to him. I vowed to accompany him in every danger, <lb/>
to vie with him in military ardor; to combat and to die <lb/>
by his side.</p>
<p>I delighted to assume the male dress, to acquire skill at <lb/>
the sword, and dexterity in every boisterous exercise. The <lb/>
timidity that commonly attends women, gradually vanished. <lb/>
I felt as if imbued by a soul that was a stranger to the <reg orig="sex-|ual">sexual</reg> <lb/>
distinction. We embarked at Brest, in a frigate <reg orig="des-|tined">destined</reg> <lb/>
for St. Domingo. A desperate conflict with an English <lb/>
ship in the bay of Biscay, was my first introduction to a <lb/>
scene of tumult and danger, of whose true nature, I had <lb/>
formed no previous conception. At first I was spiritless and <lb/>
full of dismay. Experience, however, gradually reconciled <lb/>
me to the life that I had chosen.</p>
<p>A fortunate shot, by dismasting the enemy, allowed us to <lb/>
prosecute our voyage unmolested. At Cape Francois we <lb/>
found a ship which transported us, after various perils, to <lb/>
Richmond in Virginia. I will not carry you through the <lb/>
adventures of four years. You, sitting all your life in <reg orig="peace-|ful">peaceful</reg> <lb/>
corners, can scarcely imagine that variety of hardship <lb/>
and turmoil, which attends the female who lives in a camp.</p>
<p>Few would sustain these hardships with better grace than <lb/>
I did. I could seldom be prevailed on to remain at a <reg orig="dis-|tance">distance</reg> <lb/>
and inactive, when my husband was in battle, and <lb/>
more than once rescued him from death, by the seasonable <lb/>
destruction of his adversary.</p>
<p>At the repulse of the Americans at Germantown, <reg orig="Went-|worth">Wentworth</reg> <lb/>
was wounded and taken prisoner. I obtained <reg orig="permis-|sion">permission</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="178" entity="eaf033v5_0191" pid="uva-lib:350457"/>
to attend his sick bed and supply that care, without <lb/>
which he would assuredly have died. Being imperfectly <lb/>
recovered, he was sent to England, and subjected to a <reg orig="rig-|orous">rigorous</reg> <lb/>
imprisonment. Milder treatment might have <reg orig="permit-|ted">permitted</reg> <lb/>
his complete restoration to health, but, as it was, he died.</p>
<p>His kindred were noble, and rich, and powerful, but it <lb/>
was difficult to make them acquainted with Wentworth's <lb/>
situation. Their assistance when demanded, was readily <lb/>
afforded, but it came too late to prevent his death. Me <lb/>
they snatched from my voluntary prison, and employed <lb/>
every friendly art to efface from my mind the images of <reg orig="re-|cent">recent</reg> <lb/>
calamity.</p>
<p>Wentworth's singularities of conduct and opinion, had <lb/>
estranged him at an early age from his family. They felt <lb/>
little regret at his fate, but every motive concurred to secure <lb/>
their affection and succor to me. My character was known <lb/>
to many officers, returned from America, whose report, <lb/>
joined with the influence of my conversation, rendered me <lb/>
an object to be gazed at by thousands. Strange vicissitude! <lb/>
Now immersed in the infection of a military hospital, the <lb/>
sport of a wayward fortune, struggling with cold and hunger, <lb/>
with negligence and contumely. A month after passing <lb/>
into scenes of gaiety and luxury, exhibited at operas and <lb/>
masquerades, made the theme of inquiry and encomium at <lb/>
every place of resort, and caressed by the most illustrious <lb/>
among the votaries of science, and the advocates of the <lb/>
American cause.</p>
<p>Here I again met Madame de Leyva. This woman was <lb/>
perpetually assuming new forms. She was a sincere <reg orig="con-|vert">convert</reg> <lb/>
to the Catholic religion, but she was open to every new <lb/>
impression. She was the dupe of every powerful reasoner, <lb/>
and assumed with equal facility the most opposite shapes. <lb/>
She had again reverted to the Protestant religion, and <reg orig="go-|verned">governed</reg> <lb/>
by a headlong zeal in whatever cause she engaged, <lb/>
she had sacrificed her husband and child to a new <reg orig="con-|viction">conviction</reg>.</p>
<p>The instrument of this change, was a man who passed, at <lb/>
that time, for a Frenchman. He was young, accomplished <lb/>
and addressful, but was not suspected of having been <lb/>
prompted by illicit views, or of having seduced the lady <lb/>
from allegiance to her husband as well as to her God. De <lb/>
<pb n="179" entity="eaf033v5_0192" pid="uva-lib:350458"/>
Leyva, however, who was sincere in his religion as well as <lb/>
his love, was hasty to avenge this injury, and in a contest <lb/>
with the Frenchman, was killed. His wife adopted at once, <lb/>
her ancient religion and country, and was once more an <lb/>
English woman.</p>
<p>At our meeting her affection for me seemed to be revived, <lb/>
and the most passionate entreaties were used to detain me <lb/>
in England. My previous arrangements would not suffer it. <lb/>
I foresaw restraints and inconveniences from the violence <lb/>
and caprice of her passions, and intended henceforth to <lb/>
keep my liberty inviolate by any species of engagement, <lb/>
either of friendship or marriage. My habits were French, <lb/>
and I proposed henceforward to take up my abode at Paris. <lb/>
Since his voyage to Guiana, I had heard no tidings of <reg orig="Se-|bastian">Sebastian</reg> <lb/>
Roselli. This man's image was cherished with filial <lb/>
emotions, and I conceived that the sight of him would amply <lb/>
reward a longer journey than from London to Marseilles.</p>
<p>Beyond my hopes, I found him in his ancient abode. <lb/>
The voyage and a residence of three years at Cayenne, had <lb/>
been beneficial to his appearance and health. He greeted <lb/>
me with paternal tenderness, and admitted me to a full <reg orig="par-|ticipation">participation</reg> <lb/>
of his fortune, which the sale of his American <reg orig="pro-|perty">property</reg> <lb/>
had greatly enhanced. He was a stranger to the fate <lb/>
of my brother. On his return home, he had gone to <reg orig="Swit-|zerland">Switzerland</reg> <lb/>
with a view of ascertaining his destiny. The youth, <lb/>
a few months after his arrival at Lausanne, had eloped with <lb/>
a companion, and had hitherto eluded all Roselli's searches <lb/>
and inquiries. My father was easily prevailed upon to <lb/>
transfer his residence from Provence to Paris.</p>
<p>Here Martinette paused, and marking the clock, it is time, <lb/>
resumed she, to be gone. Are you not weary of my tale? <lb/>
On the day I entered France, I entered the twenty-third <lb/>
year of my age, so that my promise of detailing my <reg orig="youth-|ful">youthful</reg> <lb/>
adventures, is fulfilled. I must away. Till we meet <lb/>
again, farewell.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXI.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Such</hi> was the wild series of Martinett's adventures. <lb/>
Each incident fastened on the memory of Constantia, and <lb/>
gave birth to numberless reflections. Her prospect of <reg orig="man-|kind">mankind</reg> <lb/>
seemed to be enlarged, on a sudden, to double its <reg orig="an-|cient">ancient</reg> <lb/>
dimensions. Ormond's narratives had carried her <reg orig="be-|yond">beyond</reg> <lb/>
the Mississippi, and into the deserts of Siberia. He <lb/>
had recounted the perils of a Russian war, and painted the <lb/>
manners of Mongals and Naudowessies. Her new friend <lb/>
had led her back to the civilized world, and portrayed the <lb/>
other half of the species. Men, in their two forms, of <reg orig="sav-|age">savage</reg> <lb/>
and refined, had been scrutinized by these observers, <lb/>
and what was wanting in the delineations of the one, was <lb/>
liberally supplied by the other.</p>
<p>Eleven years, in the life of Martinette, was unrelated. <lb/>
Her conversation suggested the opinion that this interval had <lb/>
been spent in France. It was obvious to suppose, that a <lb/>
woman, thus fearless and sagacious, had not been inactive at <lb/>
a period like the present, which called forth talents and <lb/>
courage, without distinction of sex, and had been <reg orig="particular-|ly">particularly</reg> <lb/>
distinguished by female enterprise and heroism. Her <lb/>
name easily led to the suspicion of concurrence with the <lb/>
subverters of monarchy, and of participation in their fall. <lb/>
Her flight from the merciless tribunals of the faction that <lb/>
now reigned, would explain present appearances.</p>
<p>Martinette brought to their next interview, an air of <reg orig="un-|common">uncommon</reg> <lb/>
exultation. On this being remarked, she <reg orig="commu-|nicated">communicated</reg> <lb/>
the tidings of the fall of the sanguinary tyranny of <lb/>
Robespierre. Her eyes sparkled, and every feature was <lb/>
pregnant with delight, while she unfolded, with her <reg orig="accus-|tomed">accustomed</reg> <lb/>
energy, the particulars of this tremendous revolution. <lb/>
The blood, which it occasioned to flow, was mentioned <reg orig="with-|out">without</reg> <lb/>
any symptoms of disgust or horror.</p>
<p>Constantia ventured to ask, if this incident was likely to <reg orig="in-|fluence">influence</reg> <lb/>
her own condition.</p>
<p>Yes. It will open the way for my return.</p>
<p>Then you think of returning to a scene of so much <reg orig="dan-|ger">danger</reg>?</p>
<pb n="181" entity="eaf033v5_0194" pid="uva-lib:350460"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">16</fw></pb>
<p>Danger, my girl? It is my element. I am an adorer of <lb/>
liberty, and liberty without peril can never exist.</p>
<p>But so much bloodshed, and injustice! Does not your <lb/>
heart shrink from the view of a scene of massacre and tumult, <lb/>
such as Paris has lately exhibited and will probably continue <lb/>
to exhibit?</p>
<p>Thou talkest, Constantia, in a way scarcely worthy of thy <lb/>
good sense. Have I not been three years in a camp? <lb/>
What are bleeding wounds and mangled corpses, when <reg orig="ac-|customed">accustomed</reg> <lb/>
to the daily sight of them for years? Am I not a <lb/>
lover of liberty, and must I not exult in the fall of tyrants, <lb/>
and regret only that my hand had no share in their <reg orig="destruc-|tion">destruction</reg>?</p>
<p>But a woman&mdash;how can the heart of woman be inured to <lb/>
the shedding of blood?</p>
<p>Have women, I beseech thee, no capacity to reason and <lb/>
infer? Are they less open than men to the influence of <lb/>
habit? My hand never faltered when liberty demanded the <lb/>
victim. If thou wert with me at Paris, I could shew thee a <lb/>
fusil of two barrels, which is precious beyond any other <reg orig="re-|lick">relick</reg>, <lb/>
merely because it enabled me to kill thirteen officers <lb/>
at Jenappe. Two of these were emigrant nobles, whom I <lb/>
knew and loved before the revolution, but the cause they had <lb/>
since espoused, cancelled their claims to mercy.</p>
<p>What, said the startled Constantia, have you fought in the <lb/>
ranks?</p>
<p>Certainly. Hundreds of my sex have done the same. <lb/>
Some were impelled by the enthusiasm of love, and some <lb/>
by a mere passion for war; some by the contagion of <reg orig="ex-|ample">example</reg>; <lb/>
and some, with whom I myself must be ranked, by <lb/>
a generous devotion to liberty. Brunswick and Saxe <reg orig="Co-|burg">Coburg</reg>, <lb/>
had to contend with whole regiments of women; <reg orig="re-|giments">regiments</reg> <lb/>
they would have formed, if they had been collected <lb/>
into separate bodies.</p>
<p>I will tell thee a secret. Thou wouldst never have seen <lb/>
Martinette de Beauvais, if Brunswick had deferred one day <lb/>
longer, his orders for retreating into Germany.</p>
<p>How so?</p>
<p>She would have died by her own hand.</p>
<p>What could lead to such an outrage?</p>
<pb n="182" entity="eaf033v5_0195" pid="uva-lib:350461"/>
<p>The love of liberty.</p>
<p>I cannot comprehend how that love should prompt you to <lb/>
suicide.</p>
<p>I will tell thee. The plan was formed and could not <reg orig="mis-|carry">miscarry</reg>. <lb/>
A woman was to play the part of a banished <reg orig="Royal-|ist">Royalist</reg>, <lb/>
was to repair to the Prussian camp, and to gain <reg orig="admis-|sion">admission</reg> <lb/>
to the general. This would have easily been granted <lb/>
to a female and an ex-noble. There she was to assassinate <lb/>
the enemy of her country, and to attest her magnanimity by <lb/>
slaughtering herself. I was weak enough to regret the <reg orig="igno-|minious">ignominious</reg> <lb/>
retreat of the Prussians, because it precluded the <lb/>
necessity of such a sacrifice.</p>
<p>This was related with accents and looks that sufficiently <lb/>
attested its truth. Constantia shuddered and drew back, to <lb/>
contemplate more deliberately the features of her guest. <lb/>
Hitherto she had read in them nothing that bespoke the <reg orig="des-|perate">desperate</reg> <lb/>
courage of a martyr, and the deep designing of an <lb/>
assassin. The image which her mind had reflected, from <lb/>
the deportment of this woman, was changed. The likeness <lb/>
which she had feigned to herself, was no longer seen. She <lb/>
felt that antipathy was preparing to displace love. These <lb/>
sentiments, however, she concealed, and suffered the <reg orig="con-|versation">conversation</reg> <lb/>
to proceed.</p>
<p>Their discourse now turned upon the exploits of several <lb/>
women, who mingled in the tumults of the capital and in the <lb/>
armies on the frontiers. Instances were mentioned of <reg orig="fero-|city">ferocity</reg> <lb/>
in some, and magnanimity in others, which almost <reg orig="sur-|passed">surpassed</reg> <lb/>
belief. Constantia listened greedily, though not with <lb/>
approbation, and acquired, at every sentence, new desire to <lb/>
be acquainted with the personal history of Martinette. On <lb/>
mentioning this wish, her friend said, that she endeavored to <lb/>
amuse her exile, by composing her own memoirs, and that, <lb/>
on her next visit, she would bring with her the volume, <lb/>
which she would suffer Constantia to read.</p>
<p>A separation of a week elapsed. She felt some impatience <lb/>
for the renewal of their intercourse, and for the perusal of the <lb/>
volume that had been mentioned. One evening Sarah <reg orig="Bax-|ter">Baxter</reg>, <lb/>
whom Constantia had placed in her own occasional <reg orig="ser-|vice">service</reg>, <lb/>
entered the room with marks of great joy and surprise, <lb/>
and informed her that she at length had discovered Miss <reg orig="Mon-|rose">Monrose</reg>. <lb/>
From her abrupt and prolix account, it appeared, that <lb/>
<pb n="183" entity="eaf033v5_0196" pid="uva-lib:350462"/>
Sarah had overtaken Miss Monrose in the street, and guided <lb/>
by her own curiosity, as well as by the wish to gratify her <lb/>
mistress, she had followed the stranger. To her utter <reg orig="as-|tonishment">astonishment</reg> <lb/>
the lady had paused at Mr. Dudley's door, with <lb/>
a seeming resolution to enter it, but presently resumed her <lb/>
way. Instead of pursuing her steps further, Sarah had <lb/>
stopped to communicate this intelligence to Constantia. <lb/>
Having delivered her news, she hastened away, but <reg orig="return-|ing">returning</reg>, <lb/>
in a moment, with a countenance of new surprise, she <lb/>
informed her mistress, that on leaving the house she had met <lb/>
Miss Monrose at the door, on the point of entering. She <lb/>
added that the stranger had inquired for Constantia, and <lb/>
was now waiting below.</p>
<p>Constantia took no time to reflect upon an incident so <reg orig="un-|expected">unexpected</reg> <lb/>
and so strange, but proceeded forthwith to the <lb/>
parlor. Martinette only was there. It did not instantly <lb/>
occur to her that this lady and Mademoiselle Monrose <lb/>
might possibly be the same. The inquiries she made <reg orig="speed-|ily">speedily</reg> <lb/>
removed her doubts, and it now appeared that the woman, <lb/>
about whose destiny she had formed so many conjectures, <lb/>
and fostered so much anxiety, was no other than the <reg orig="daugh-|ter">daughter</reg> <lb/>
of Roselli.</p>
<p>Having readily answered her questions, Martinette <reg orig="in-|quired">inquired</reg> <lb/>
in her turn, into the motives of her friend's curiosity. <lb/>
These were explained by a succinct account of the <reg orig="transac-|tions">transactions</reg>, <lb/>
to which the deceased Baxter had been a witness. <lb/>
Constantia concluded, with mentioning her own reflections <lb/>
on the tale, and intimating her wish to be informed how <lb/>
Martinette had extricated herself from a situation so <reg orig="calami-|tous">calamitous</reg>.</p>
<p>Is there any room for wonder on that head? replied the <lb/>
guest. It was absurd to stay longer in the house. Having <lb/>
finished the interment of Roselli, (soldier fashion,) for he <lb/>
was the man who suffered his foolish regrets to destroy him, <lb/>
I forsook the house. Roselli was by no means poor, but he <lb/>
could not consent to live at ease, or to live at all, while his <lb/>
country endured such horrible oppressions, and when so <lb/>
many of his friends had perished. I complied with his <lb/>
humor, because it could not be changed, and I revered <lb/>
him too much to desert him.</p>
<pb n="184" entity="eaf033v5_0197" pid="uva-lib:350463"/>
<p>But whither, said Constantia, could you seek shelter at a <lb/>
time like that? The city was desolate, and a wandering <lb/>
female could scarcely be received under any roof. All <reg orig="in-|habited">inhabited</reg> <lb/>
houses were closed at that hour, and the fear of <reg orig="in-|fection">infection</reg> <lb/>
would have shut them against you, if they had not <lb/>
been already so.</p>
<p>Hast thou forgotten that there were at that time, at least ten <lb/>
thousand French in this city, fugitives from Marat and from <lb/>
St. Domingo? That they lived in utter fearlessness of the <lb/>
reigning disease; sung and loitered in the public walks, and <lb/>
prattled at their doors, with all their customary unconcern? <lb/>
Supposest thou that there were none among these, who <lb/>
would receive a countrywoman, even if her name had not been <lb/>
Martinette de Beauvais? Thy fancy has depicted strange <lb/>
things, but believe me, that, without a farthing and without <lb/>
a name, I should not have incurred the slightest <reg orig="inconveni-|ence">inconvenience</reg>. <lb/>
The death of Roselli I foresaw, because it was <reg orig="grad-|ual">gradual</reg> <lb/>
in its approach, and was sought by him as a good. My <lb/>
grief, therefore, was exhausted, before it came, and I <reg orig="re-|joiced">rejoiced</reg> <lb/>
at his death, because it was the close of all his <reg orig="sor-|rows">sorrows</reg>. <lb/>
The rueful pictures of my distress and weakness, <lb/>
which were given by Baxter, existed only in his own fancy.</p>
<p>Martinette pleaded an engagement, and took her leave, <lb/>
professing to have come merely to leave with her the <reg orig="pro-|mised">promised</reg> <lb/>
manuscript. This interview, though short, was <reg orig="produc-|tive">productive</reg> <lb/>
of many reflections, on the deceitfulness of appearances, <lb/>
and on the variety of maxims by which the conduct of <lb/>
human beings is regulated. She was accustomed to impart <lb/>
all her thoughts and relate every new incident to her father. <lb/>
With this view she now hied to his apartment. This hour <lb/>
it was her custom, when disengaged, always to spend with <lb/>
him.</p>
<p>She found Mr. Dudley busy in revolving a scheme, which <lb/>
various circumstances had suggested and gradually <reg orig="conduct-|ed">conducted</reg> <lb/>
to maturity. No period of his life had been equally <reg orig="de-|lightful">delightful</reg>, <lb/>
with that portion of his youth which he had spent in <lb/>
Italy. The climate, the language, the manners of the <lb/>
people, and the sources of intellectual gratification, in <reg orig="paint-|ing">painting</reg> <lb/>
and music, were congenial to his taste. He had <reg orig="reluc-|tantly">reluctantly</reg> <lb/>
forsaken these enchanting seats, at the summons of <lb/>
his father, but, on his return to his native country, had <reg orig="en-|countered">encountered</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="185" entity="eaf033v5_0198" pid="uva-lib:350464"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">16*</fw></pb>
nothing but ignominy and pain. Poverty and <lb/>
blindness had beset his path, and it seemed as if it were <reg orig="im-|possible">impossible</reg> <lb/>
to fly too far from the scene of his disasters. His <lb/>
misfortunes could not be concealed from others, and every <lb/>
thing around him seemed to renew the memory of all that <lb/>
he had suffered. All the events of his youth served to <lb/>
entice him to Italy, while all the incidents of his subsequent <lb/>
life, concurred to render disgustful his present abode.</p>
<p>His daughter's happiness was not to be forgotten. This <lb/>
he imagined would be eminently promoted by the scheme. <lb/>
It would open to her new avenues to knowledge. It would <lb/>
snatch her from the odious pursuit of Ormond, and by a <lb/>
variety of objects and adventures, efface from her mind any <lb/>
impression which his dangerous artifices might have made <lb/>
upon it.</p>
<p>This project was now communicated to Constantia. <lb/>
Every argument adapted to influence her choice, was <reg orig="em-|ployed">employed</reg>. <lb/>
He justly conceived that the only obstacle to her <lb/>
adoption of it, related to Ormond. He expatiated on the <lb/>
dubious character of this man, the wildness of his schemes, <lb/>
and the magnitude of his errors. What could be expected <lb/>
from a man, half of whose life had been spent at the head of <lb/>
a band of Cassacks, spreading devastation in the regions of <lb/>
the Danube, and supporting by flagitious intrigues, the <reg orig="ty-|ranny">tyranny</reg> <lb/>
of Catharine, and the other half in traversing <reg orig="inhos-|pitable">inhospitable</reg> <lb/>
countries, and extinguishing what remained of <reg orig="cle-|mency">clemency</reg> <lb/>
and justice, by intercourse with savages?</p>
<p>It was admitted that his energies were great, but <reg orig="misdi-|rected">misdirected</reg>, <lb/>
and that to restore them to the guidance of truth, <lb/>
was not in itself impossible, but it was so with relation to <lb/>
any power that she possessed. Conformity would flow <lb/>
from their marriage, but this conformity was not to be <reg orig="ex-|pected">expected</reg> <lb/>
from him. It was not his custom to abjure any of <lb/>
his doctrines or recede from any of his claims. She <lb/>
knew likewise the conditions of their union. She must go <lb/>
with him to some corner of the world, where his boasted <lb/>
system was established. What was the road to it, he had <lb/>
carefully concealed, but it was evident that it lay beyond the <lb/>
precincts of civilized existence.</p>
<pb n="186" entity="eaf033v5_0199" pid="uva-lib:350465"/>
<p>Whatever were her ultimate decision, it was at least <lb/>
proper to delay it. Six years were yet wanting of that <reg orig="pe-|riod">period</reg>, <lb/>
at which only she formerly considered marriage as <lb/>
proper. To all the general motives for deferring her choice, <lb/>
the conduct of Ormond superadded the weightiest. Their <lb/>
correspondence might continue, but her residence in Europe <lb/>
and converse with mankind, might enlighten her judgment <lb/>
and qualify her for a more rational decision.</p>
<p>Constantia was not uninfluenced by these reasonings. <reg orig="In-|stead">Instead</reg> <lb/>
of reluctantly admitting them, she somewhat <reg orig="wonder-|ed">wondered</reg> <lb/>
that they had not been suggested by her own reflections. <lb/>
Her imagination anticipated her entrance on that mighty <lb/>
scene with emotions little less than rapturous. Her studies <lb/>
had conferred a thousand ideal charms on a theatre, where <lb/>
Scipio and C&aelig;sar had performed their parts. Her wishes <lb/>
were no less importunate to gaze upon the Alps and <reg orig="Pyre-|nees">Pyrenees</reg>, <lb/>
and to vivify and chasten the images collected from <lb/>
books, by comparing them with their real prototypes.</p>
<p>No social ties existed to hold her to America. Her only <lb/>
kinsman and friend would be the companion of her journeys. <lb/>
This project was likewise recommended by advantages of <lb/>
which she only was qualified to judge. Sophia <reg orig="West-|wyn">Westwyn</reg> <lb/>
had embarked, four years previous to this date, for <lb/>
England, in company with an English lady and her husband. <lb/>
The arrangements that were made forbade either of the <lb/>
friends to hope for a future meeting. Yet now, by virtue <lb/>
of this project, this meeting seemed no longer to be <reg orig="hope-|less">hopeless</reg>.</p>
<p>This burst of new ideas and new hopes on the mind of <lb/>
Constantia took place in the course of a single hour. No <lb/>
change in her external situation had been wrought, and yet <lb/>
her mind had undergone the most signal revolution. The <lb/>
novelty as well as greatness of the prospect kept her in a <lb/>
state of elevation and awe, more ravishing than any she had <lb/>
ever experienced. Anticipations of intercourse with nature <lb/>
in her most august forms, with men in diversified states of <lb/>
society, with the posterity of Greeks and Romans, and with <lb/>
the actors that were now upon the stage, and above all with <lb/>
the being whom absence and the want of other attachments, <lb/>
had, in some sort, contributed to deify, made this night pass <lb/>
away upon the wings of transport.</p>
<pb n="187" entity="eaf033v5_0200" pid="uva-lib:350466"/>
<p>The hesitation which existed on parting with her father, <lb/>
speedily gave place to an ardor impatient of the least delay. <lb/>
She saw no impediments to the immediate commencement <lb/>
of the voyage. To delay it a month or even a week, <reg orig="seem-|ed">seemed</reg> <lb/>
to be unprofitable tardiness. In this ferment of her <lb/>
thoughts, she was neither able nor willing to sleep. In <lb/>
arranging the means of departure and anticipating the events <lb/>
that would successively arise, there was abundant food for <lb/>
contemplation.</p>
<p>She marked the first dawnings of the day, and rose. She <lb/>
felt reluctance to break upon her father's morning slumbers, <lb/>
but considered that her motives were extremely urgent, and <lb/>
that the pleasure afforded him by her zealous approbation <lb/>
of his scheme, would amply compensate him for this <reg orig="unsea-|sonable">unseasonable</reg> <lb/>
intrusion on his rest. She hastened therefore to his <lb/>
chamber. She entered with blithsome steps, and softly drew <lb/>
aside the curtain.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Unhappy</hi> Constantia! At the moment when thy dearest <lb/>
hopes had budded afresh, when the clouds of insecurity and <lb/>
disquiet had retired from thy vision, wast thou assailed by <lb/>
the great subverter of human schemes. Thou sawest <reg orig="noth-|ing">nothing</reg> <lb/>
in futurity but an eternal variation and succession of <lb/>
delights. Thou wast hastening to forget dangers and <reg orig="sor-|rows">sorrows</reg> <lb/>
which thou fondly imaginedst were never to return. <lb/>
This day was to be the outset of a new career; existence <lb/>
was henceforth to be embellished with enjoyments, hitherto <lb/>
scarcely within the reach of hope.</p>
<p>Alas! Thy predictions of calamity seldom failed to be <lb/>
verified. Not so thy prognostics of pleasure. These, <lb/>
though fortified by every calculation of contingencies, were <lb/>
edifices grounded upon nothing. Thy life was a struggle <lb/>
with malignant destiny; a contest for happiness in which <lb/>
thou wast fated to be overcome.</p>
<p>She stooped to kiss the venerable cheek of her father, <lb/>
and, by whispering, to break his slumber. Her eye was no <lb/>
<pb n="188" entity="eaf033v5_0201" pid="uva-lib:350467"/>
sooner fixed upon his countenance, than she started back <lb/>
and shrieked. She had no power to forbear. Her <reg orig="out-|cries">outcries</reg> <lb/>
were piercing and vehement. They ceased only with <lb/>
the cessation of breath. She sunk upon a chair in a state <lb/>
partaking more of death than of life, mechanically <reg orig="prompt-|ed">prompted</reg> <lb/>
to give vent to her agonies in shrieks, but incapable of <lb/>
uttering a sound.</p>
<p>The alarm called her servants to the spot. They <reg orig="be-|held">beheld</reg> <lb/>
her dumb, wildly gazing, and gesticulating in a way <lb/>
that indicated frenzy. She made no resistance to their <lb/>
efforts, but permitted them to carry her back to her own <lb/>
chamber. Sarah called upon her to speak, and to explain <lb/>
the cause of these appearances, but the shock which she <lb/>
had endured, seemed to have irretrievably destroyed her <lb/>
powers of utterance.</p>
<p>The terrors of the affectionate Sarah were increased. <lb/>
She kneeled by the bedside of her mistress, and with <lb/>
streaming eyes, besought the unhappy lady to compose <lb/>
herself. Perhaps the sight of weeping in another <reg orig="possess-|ed">possessed</reg> <lb/>
a sympathetic influence, or nature had made provision <lb/>
for this salutary change. However that be, a torrent of <lb/>
tears now came to her succor, and rescued her from a <lb/>
paroxysm of insanity, which its longer continuance might <lb/>
have set beyond the reach of cure.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a glance at his master's countenance made <lb/>
Fabian fully acquainted with the nature of the scene. The <lb/>
ghastly visage of Mr. Dudley shewed that he was dead, <lb/>
and that he had died in some terrific and mysterious <reg orig="man-|ner">manner</reg>. <lb/>
As soon as this faithful servant recovered from <reg orig="sur-|prise">surprise</reg>, <lb/>
the first expedient which his ingenuity suggested, <lb/>
was to fly with tidings of this event to Mr. Melbourne. <lb/>
That gentleman instantly obeyed the summons. With the <lb/>
power of weeping, Constantia recovered the power of <reg orig="re-|flection">reflection</reg>. <lb/>
This, for a time, served her only as a medium <lb/>
of anguish. Melbourne mingled his tears with hers, and <lb/>
endeavored, by suitable remonstrances, to revive her <reg orig="for-|titude">fortitude</reg>.</p>
<p>The filial passion is perhaps instinctive to man; but its <lb/>
energy is modified by various circumstances. Every event <lb/>
in the life of Constantia contributed to heighten this passion <lb/>
beyond customary bounds. In the habit of perpetual <reg orig="at-|tendance">attendance</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="189" entity="eaf033v5_0202" pid="uva-lib:350468"/>
on her father, of deriving from him her <reg orig="know-|ledge">knowledge</reg>, <lb/>
and sharing with him the hourly fruits of observation <lb/>
and reflection, his existence seemed blended with her own. <lb/>
There was no other whose concurrence and council she <lb/>
could claim, with whom a domestic and uninterrupted <reg orig="alli-|ance">alliance</reg> <lb/>
could be maintained. The only bond of <reg orig="consangui-|nity">consanguinity</reg> <lb/>
was loosened, the only prop of friendship was taken <lb/>
away.</p>
<p>Others, perhaps, would have observed, that her father's <lb/>
existence had been merely a source of obstruction and <reg orig="per-|plexity">perplexity</reg>; <lb/>
that she had hitherto acted by her own wisdom, <lb/>
and would find, hereafter, less difficulty in her choice of <lb/>
schemes, and fewer impediments to the execution. These <lb/>
reflections occurred not to her. This disaster had increased, <lb/>
to an insupportable degree, the vacancy and dreariness of <lb/>
her existence. The face she was habituated to behold, had <lb/>
disappeared forever; the voice, whose mild and affecting <lb/>
tones had so long been familiar to her ears, was hushed into <lb/>
eternal silence. The felicity to which she clung was <reg orig="ravish-|ed">ravished</reg> <lb/>
away; nothing remained to hinder her from sinking into <lb/>
utter despair.</p>
<p>The first transports of grief having subsided, a source of <lb/>
consolation seemed to be opened in the belief that her father <lb/>
had only changed one form of being for another; that he <lb/>
still lived to be the guardian of her peace and honor; to <lb/>
enter the recesses of her thought; to forewarn her of evil <lb/>
and invite her to good. She grasped at these images with <lb/>
eagerness, and fostered them as the only solaces of her <lb/>
calamity. They were not adapted to inspire her with <reg orig="cheer-|fulness">cheerfulness</reg>, <lb/>
but they sublimed her sensations, and added an <lb/>
inexplicable fascination to sorrow.</p>
<p>It was unavoidable sometimes to reflect upon the nature <lb/>
of that death which had occurred. Tokens were sufficiently <lb/>
apparent that outward violence had been the cause. Who <lb/>
could be the performer of so black a deed, by what motives <lb/>
he was guided were topics of fruitless conjecture. She <lb/>
mused upon this subject, not from the thirst of vengeance, <lb/>
but from a mournful curiosity. Had the perpetrator stood <lb/>
before her, and challenged retribution, she would not have <lb/>
lifted a finger to accuse or to punish. The evil already <reg orig="en-|dured">endured</reg>, <lb/>
left her no power to concert and execute projects <lb/>
<pb n="190" entity="eaf033v5_0203" pid="uva-lib:350469"/>
for extending that evil to others. Her mind was unnerved, <lb/>
and recoiled with loathing from considerations of abstract <lb/>
justice, or political utility, when they prompted to the <reg orig="prose-|cution">prosecution</reg> <lb/>
of the murderer.</p>
<p>Melbourne was actuated by different views, but, on this <lb/>
subject, he was painfully bewildered. Mr. Dudley's <reg orig="deport-|ment">deportment</reg> <lb/>
to his servants and neighbors, was gentle and humane. <lb/>
He had no dealings with the trafficking or laboring part of <lb/>
mankind. The fund which supplied his cravings of <reg orig="neces-|sity">necessity</reg> <lb/>
or habit, was his daughter's. His recreations and <lb/>
employments were harmless and lonely. The evil purpose <lb/>
was limited to his death, for his chamber was exactly in <lb/>
the same state in which negligent security had left it. No <lb/>
midnight footstep or voice, no unbarred door or lifted <lb/>
window afforded tokens of the presence, or traces of the <lb/>
entrance or flight of the assassin.</p>
<p>The meditations of Constantia however, could not fail, <lb/>
in some of their circuities, to encounter the image of Craig. <lb/>
His agency in the impoverishment of her father, and in the <lb/>
scheme by which she had like to have been loaded with <lb/>
the penalties of forgery, was of an impervious and <reg orig="unpre-|cedented">unprecedented</reg> <lb/>
kind. Motives were unveiled by time, in some <lb/>
degree, accounting for his treacherous proceeding, but there <lb/>
was room to suppose an inborn propensity to mischief. <lb/>
Was he not the author of this new evil? His motives and <lb/>
his means were equally inscrutable, but their inscrutability <lb/>
might flow from her own defects in discernment and <reg orig="know-|ledge">knowledge</reg>, <lb/>
and time might supply her defects in this as in <lb/>
former instances.</p>
<p>These images were casual. The causes of the evil were <lb/>
seldom contemplated. Her mind was rarely at liberty to <lb/>
wander from reflection on her irremediable loss. Frequently, <lb/>
when confused by distressful recollections, she would detect <lb/>
herself going to her father's chamber. Often his well known <lb/>
accents would ring in her ears, and the momentary impulse <lb/>
would be to answer his calls. Her reluctance to sit down to <lb/>
her meals, without her usual companion, could scarcely be <lb/>
surmounted.</p>
<p>In this state of mind the image of the only friend who <reg orig="sur-|vived">survived</reg>, <lb/>
or whose destiny, at least, was doubtful, occurred to <lb/>
her. She sunk into fits of deeper abstraction and dissolved <lb/>
<pb n="191" entity="eaf033v5_0204" pid="uva-lib:350470"/>
away in tears of more agonizing tenderness. A week after <lb/>
her father's interment, she shut herself up in her chamber, to <lb/>
torment herself with fruitless remembrances. The name of <lb/>
Sophia Westwyn was pronounced, and the ditty that <reg orig="solem-|nized">solemnized</reg> <lb/>
their parting was sung. Now, more than formerly, <lb/>
she became sensible of the loss of that portrait, which had <lb/>
been deposited in the hands of M'Crea, as a pledge. As <lb/>
soon as her change of fortune had supplied her with the <lb/>
means of redeeming it, she hastened to M'Crea for that end. <lb/>
To her unspeakable disappointment he was absent from the <lb/>
city; he had taken a long journey, and the exact period of <lb/>
his return could not be ascertained. His clerks refused to <lb/>
deliver the picture, or even, by searching, to discover <reg orig="whe-|ther">whether</reg> <lb/>
it was still in their master's possession. This application <lb/>
had frequently and lately been repeated, but without success; <lb/>
M'Crea had not yet returned and his family were equally in <lb/>
the dark, as to the day on which his return might be <reg orig="ex-|pected">expected</reg>.</p>
<p>She determined on this occasion, to renew her visit. Her <lb/>
incessant disappointments had almost extinguished hope, and <lb/>
she made inquiries at his door, with a faltering accent and <lb/>
sinking heart. These emotions were changed into surprise <lb/>
and delight, when answer was made that he had just arrived. <lb/>
She was instantly conducted into his presence.</p>
<p>The countenance of M'Crea easily denoted, that his <reg orig="visit-|ant">visitant</reg> <lb/>
was by no means acceptable. There was a mixture of <lb/>
embarrassment and sullenness in his air, which was far from <lb/>
being diminished when the purpose of this visit was <reg orig="explain-|ed">explained</reg>. <lb/>
Constantia reminded him of the offer and acceptance <lb/>
of this pledge, and of the conditions with which the <reg orig="transac-|tion">transaction</reg> <lb/>
was accompanied.</p>
<p>He acknowledged, with some hesitation, that a promise <lb/>
had been given to retain the pledge until it were in her <reg orig="pow-|er">power</reg> <lb/>
to redeem it, but the long delay, the urgency of his own <lb/>
wants, and particularly the ill treatment which he conceived <lb/>
himself to have suffered, in the transaction respecting the <lb/>
forged note, had, in his own opinion, absolved him from this <lb/>
promise. He had therefore sold the picture to a goldsmith, <lb/>
for as much as the gold about it was worth.</p>
<p>This information produced, in the heart of Constantia, a <lb/>
contest between indignation and sorrow, that, for a time, <reg orig="de-|barred">debarred</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="192" entity="eaf033v5_0205" pid="uva-lib:350471"/>
her from speech. She stifled the anger that was, at <lb/>
length, rising to her lips, and calmly inquired to whom the <lb/>
picture had been sold.</p>
<p>M'Crea answered that for his part he had little dealings in <lb/>
gold and silver, but every thing of that kind, which fell to his <lb/>
share, he transacted with Mr. D&mdash;. This person was <lb/>
one of the most eminent of his profession. His character <lb/>
and place of abode were universally known. The only <reg orig="ex-|pedient">expedient</reg> <lb/>
that remained was to apply to him, and to ascertain, <lb/>
forthwith, the destiny of the picture. It was too probable, <lb/>
that when separated from its case, the portrait was thrown <lb/>
away or destroyed, as a mere incumbrance, but the truth <lb/>
was too momentous to be made the sport of mere <reg orig="proba-|bility">probability</reg>. <lb/>
She left the house of M'Crea, and hastened to that <lb/>
of the goldsmith.</p>
<p>The circumstance was easily recalled to his remembrance. <lb/>
It was true that such a picture had been offered for sale, and <lb/>
that he had purchased it. The workmanship was curious, <lb/>
and he felt unwilling to destroy it. He therefore hung it up <lb/>
in his shop and indulged the hope that a purchaser would, <lb/>
sometime, be attracted by the mere beauty of the toy.</p>
<p>Constantia's hopes were revived by these tidings, and she <lb/>
earnestly inquired if it were still in his possession.</p>
<p>No. A young gentleman had entered his shop some <lb/>
months before; the picture had caught his fancy, and he <lb/>
had given a price which the artist owned he should not have <lb/>
demanded, had he not been encouraged by the eagerness <lb/>
which the gentleman betrayed to possess it.</p>
<p>Who was this gentleman? Had there been any previous <lb/>
acquaintance between them? What was his name, his <reg orig="pro-|fession">profession</reg>, <lb/>
and where was he to be found?</p>
<p>Really, the goldsmith answered, he was ignorant <reg orig="respect-|ing">respecting</reg> <lb/>
all those particulars. Previously to this purchase, the <lb/>
gentleman had sometimes visited his shop, but he did not <reg orig="re-|collect">recollect</reg> <lb/>
to have since seen him. He was unacquainted with <lb/>
his name and his residence.</p>
<p>What appeared to be his motives for purchasing this <reg orig="pic-|ture">picture</reg>?</p>
<p>The customer appeared highly pleased with it. Pleasure, <lb/>
rather than surprise, seemed to be produced by the sight of <lb/>
it. If I were permitted to judge, continued the artist, I <lb/>
<pb n="193" entity="eaf033v5_0206" pid="uva-lib:350472"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">17</fw></pb>
should imagine that the young man was acquainted with the <lb/>
original. To say the truth, I hinted as much at the time, <lb/>
and I did not see that he discouraged the supposition. <reg orig="In-|deed">Indeed</reg>, <lb/>
I cannot conceive how the picture could otherwise <lb/>
have gained any value in his eyes.</p>
<p>This only heightened the eagerness of Constantia to trace <lb/>
the footsteps of the youth. It was obvious to suppose some <lb/>
communication or connexion between her friend and this <lb/>
purchaser. She repeated her inquiries, and the goldsmith, <lb/>
after some consideration, said;&mdash;Why, on second thoughts, I <lb/>
seem to have some notion of having seen a figure like that <lb/>
of my customer, go into a lodging house, in Front-Street, <lb/>
some time before I met with him at my shop.</p>
<p>The situation of this house being satisfactorily described, <lb/>
and the artist being able to afford her no further information, <lb/>
except as to stature and guise, she took her leave. There <lb/>
were two motives impelling her to prosecute her search after <lb/>
this person; the desire of regaining this portrait and of <reg orig="pro-|curing">procuring</reg> <lb/>
tidings of her friend. Involved as she was in <reg orig="igno-|rance">ignorance</reg>, <lb/>
it was impossible to conjecture, how far this incident <lb/>
would be subservient to these inestimable purposes. To <lb/>
procure an interview with this stranger, was the first measure <lb/>
which prudence suggested.</p>
<p>She knew not his name or his person. He was once seen <lb/>
entering a lodging house. Thither she must immediately <reg orig="re-|pair">repair</reg>, <lb/>
but how to introduce herself, how to describe the <reg orig="per-|son">person</reg> <lb/>
of whom she was in search, she knew not. She was <lb/>
beset with embarrassments and difficulties. While her <reg orig="at-|tention">attention</reg> <lb/>
was entangled by these, she proceeded <reg orig="unconscious-|ly">unconsciously</reg> <lb/>
on her way, and stopped not until she reached the <reg orig="man-|sion">mansion</reg> <lb/>
that had been described. Here she paused to collect <lb/>
her thoughts.</p>
<p>She found no relief in deliberation. Every moment <reg orig="add-|ed">added</reg> <lb/>
to her perplexity and indecision. Irresistibly impelled <lb/>
by her wishes, she at length, in a mood that partook of <reg orig="des-|perate">desperate</reg>, <lb/>
advanced to the door and knocked. The summons <lb/>
was immediately obeyed by a woman of decent appearance. <lb/>
A pause ensued, which Constantia at length terminated, by <lb/>
a request to see the mistress of the house.</p>
<pb n="194" entity="eaf033v5_0207" pid="uva-lib:350473"/>
<p>The lady courteously answered that she was the person, <lb/>
and immediately ushered her visitant into an apartment. <lb/>
Constantia being seated, the lady waited for the disclosure of <lb/>
her message. To prolong the silence was only to multiply <lb/>
embarrassments. She reverted to the state of her feelings, <lb/>
and saw that they flowed from inconsistency and folly. One <lb/>
vigorous effort was sufficient to restore her to composure <lb/>
and self-command.</p>
<p>She began with apologizing for a visit, unpreceded by an <lb/>
introduction. The object of her inquiries was a person, with <lb/>
whom it was of the utmost moment that she should procure <lb/>
a meeting, but whom, by an unfortunate concurrence of <reg orig="cir-|cumstances">circumstances</reg>, <lb/>
she was unable to describe by the usual <reg orig="inci-|dents">incidents</reg> <lb/>
of name and profession. Her knowledge was <reg orig="con-|fined">confined</reg> <lb/>
to his external appearance, and to the probability of his <lb/>
being an inmate of this house, at the beginning of the year. <lb/>
She then proceeded to describe his person and dress.</p>
<p>It is true, said the lady, such a one as you describe has <lb/>
boarded in this house. His name was Martynne. I have <lb/>
good reason to remember him, for he lived with me three <lb/>
months, and then left the country without paying for his board.</p>
<p>He has gone, then? said Constantia, greatly discouraged <lb/>
by these tidings.</p>
<p>Yes; he was a man of specious manners and loud <reg orig="pre-|tensions">pretensions</reg>. <lb/>
He came from England, bringing with him forged <lb/>
recommendatory letters, and after passing from one end of <lb/>
the country to the other, contracting debts which he never <lb/>
paid, and making bargains which he never fulfilled, he <reg orig="sud-|denly">suddenly</reg> <lb/>
disappeared. It is likely that he has returned to <reg orig="Eu-|rope">Europe</reg>.</p>
<p>Had he no kindred, no friends, no companions?</p>
<p>He found none here. He made pretences to alliances in <lb/>
England, which better information has, I believe, since shewn <lb/>
to be false.</p>
<p>This was the sum of the information procurable from this <lb/>
source. Constantia was unable to conceal her chagrin. <lb/>
These symptoms were observed by the lady, whose curiosity <lb/>
was awakened in turn. Questions were obliquely started, <lb/>
inviting Constantia to a disclosure of her thoughts. No <reg orig="ad-|vantage">advantage</reg> <lb/>
would arise from confidence, and the guest, after a <lb/>
few minutes of abstraction and silence, rose to take her leave.</p>
<pb n="195" entity="eaf033v5_0208" pid="uva-lib:350474"/>
<p>During this conference, some one appeared to be <reg orig="negli-|gently">negligently</reg> <lb/>
sporting with the keys of a harpsichord, in the next <lb/>
apartment. The notes were too irregular and faint to make <lb/>
a forcible impression on the ear. In the present state of her <lb/>
mind, Constantia was merely conscious of the sound, in the <lb/>
intervals of conversation. Having arisen from her seat, her <lb/>
anxiety to obtain some information that might lead to the <lb/>
point she wished, made her again pause. She endeavored <lb/>
to invent some new interrogatory better suited to her purpose, <lb/>
than those which had, already, been employed. A silence <lb/>
on both sides ensued.</p>
<p>During this interval, the unseen musician suddenly <reg orig="refrain-|ed">refrained</reg> <lb/>
from rambling, and glided into notes of some refinement <lb/>
and complexity. The cadence was aerial, but a thunderbolt, <lb/>
falling at her feet, would not have communicated a more <lb/>
visible shock to the senses of Constantia. A glance that <lb/>
denoted a tumult of soul bordering on distraction, was now <lb/>
fixed upon the door, that led into the room whence the <reg orig="har-|mony">harmony</reg> <lb/>
proceeded. Instantly the cadence was revived, and <lb/>
some accompanying voice, was heard to warble</p>
<lg type="poem">
<l>Ah! far beyond this world of woes,</l>
<l>We meet to part&mdash;to part no more.</l>
</lg>
<p>Joy and grief in their sudden onset, and their violent <reg orig="ex-|tremes">extremes</reg>, <lb/>
approach so nearly, in their influence on human <reg orig="be-|ings">beings</reg>, <lb/>
as scarce to be distinguished. Constantia's frame was <lb/>
still enfeebled by her recent distresses. The torrent of <lb/>
emotion was too abrupt and too vehement. Her faculties <lb/>
were overwhelmed, and she sunk upon the floor motionless <lb/>
and without sense, but not till she had faintly articulated:&mdash;</p>
<p>My God! My God! This is a joy unmerited and too <lb/>
great.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXIII.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">I must</hi> be forgiven if I now introduce myself on the stage. <lb/>
Sophia Westwyn is the friend of Constantia, and the writer <lb/>
of this narrative. So far as my fate was connected with <lb/>
<pb n="196" entity="eaf033v5_0209" pid="uva-lib:350475"/>
that of my friend, it is worthy to be known. That <reg orig="connex-|ion">connexion</reg> <lb/>
has constituted the joy and misery of my existence, and <lb/>
has prompted me to undertake this task.</p>
<p>I assume no merit from the desire of knowledge, and <reg orig="su-|periority">superiority</reg> <lb/>
to temptation. There is little of which I can boast, <lb/>
but that little I derived, instrumentally, from Constantia. <lb/>
Poor as my attainments are, it is to her that I am indebted <lb/>
for them all. Life itself was the gift of her father, but my <lb/>
virtue and felicity are her gifts. That I am neither indigent <lb/>
nor profligate, flows from her bounty.</p>
<p>I am not unaware of the divine superintendence, of the <lb/>
claims upon my gratitude and service, which pertain to my <lb/>
God. I know that all physical and moral agents are <reg orig="mere-|ly">merely</reg> <lb/>
instrumental to the purpose that he wills, but though the <lb/>
great Author of being and felicity must not be forgotten, it is <lb/>
neither possible nor just to overlook the claims upon our love, <lb/>
with which our fellow-beings are invested.</p>
<p>The supreme love does not absorb, but chasten and <reg orig="en-|force">enforce</reg> <lb/>
all subordinate affections. In proportion to the <reg orig="recti-|tude">rectitude</reg> <lb/>
of my perceptions and the ardor of my piety, must I <lb/>
clearly discern and fervently love, the excellence discovered <lb/>
in my fellow-beings, and industriously promote their <reg orig="improve-|ment">improvement</reg> <lb/>
and felicity.</p>
<p>From my infancy to my seventeenth year, I lived in the <lb/>
house of Mr. Dudley. On the day of my birth I was <reg orig="de-|serted">deserted</reg> <lb/>
by my mother. Her temper was more akin to that <lb/>
of tygress than woman. Yet that is unjust, for beasts <reg orig="che-|rish">cherish</reg> <lb/>
their offspring. No natures but human, are capable of <lb/>
that depravity, which makes insensible to the claims of <reg orig="inno-|cence">innocence</reg> <lb/>
and helplessness.</p>
<p>But let me not recall her to memory. Have I not enough <lb/>
of sorrow? Yet to omit my causes of disquiet, the <reg orig="unpre-|cedented">unprecedented</reg> <lb/>
forlornness of my condition, and the persecutions <lb/>
of an unnatural parent, would be to leave my character a <lb/>
problem, and the sources of my love of Miss Dudley <reg orig="unex-|plored">unexplored</reg>. <lb/>
Yet I must not dwell upon that complication of <reg orig="in-|iquities">iniquities</reg>, <lb/>
that savage ferocity and unextinguishable hatred of <lb/>
me, which characterized my unhappy mother!</p>
<p>I was not safe under the protection of Mr. Dudley, nor <lb/>
happy in the caresses of his daughter. My mother asserted <lb/>
the privilege of that relation; she labored for years to <reg orig="ob-|tain">obtain</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="197" entity="eaf033v5_0210" pid="uva-lib:350476"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">17*</fw></pb>
the control of my person and actions; to snatch me <lb/>
from a peaceful and chaste asylum, and detain me in her <lb/>
own house, where, indeed, I should not have been in want <lb/>
of raiment and food, but where&mdash;</p>
<p>O my mother! Let me not dishonor thy name! Yet it <lb/>
is not in my power to enhance thy infamy. Thy crimes, <lb/>
unequalled as they were, were, perhaps, expiated by thy <lb/>
penitence. Thy offences are too well known, but perhaps <lb/>
they who witnessed thy freaks of intoxication, thy defiance <lb/>
of public shame, the enormity of thy pollutions, the infatuation <lb/>
that made thee glory in the pursuit of a loathsome and <lb/>
detestable trade, may be strangers to the remorse and the <lb/>
abstinence which accompanied the close of thy ignominious <lb/>
life.</p>
<p>For ten years was my peace incessantly molested, by the <lb/>
menaces or machinations of my mother. The longer she <lb/>
meditated my destruction, the more tenacious of her purpose, <lb/>
and indefatigable in her efforts, she became. That my <lb/>
mind was harassed with perpetual alarms, was not enough. <lb/>
The fame and tranquillity of Mr. Dudley and his daughter, <lb/>
were hourly assailed. My mother resigned herself to the <lb/>
impulses of malignity and rage. Headlong passions and a <lb/>
vigorous, though perverted understanding, were her's. Hence <lb/>
her stratagems to undermine the reputation of my protector, <lb/>
and to bereave him of domestic comfort, were subtle and <lb/>
profound. Had she not herself been careless of that good, <lb/>
which she endeavored to wrest from others, her artifices <lb/>
could scarcely have been frustrated.</p>
<p>In proportion to the hazard which accrued to my protector <lb/>
and friend, the more ardent their zeal in my defence, and <lb/>
their affection for my person became. They watched over <lb/>
me with ineffable solicitude. At all hours and in every <reg orig="oc-|cupation">occupation</reg>, <lb/>
I was the companion of Constantia. All my <lb/>
wants were supplied, in the same proportion as her's. The <lb/>
tenderness of Mr. Dudley seemed equally divided between <lb/>
us. I partook of his instructions, and the means of every <lb/>
intellectual and personal gratification, were lavished upon <lb/>
me.</p>
<p>The speed of my mother's career in infamy, was at length <lb/>
slackened. She left New-York, which had long been the <lb/>
<pb n="198" entity="eaf033v5_0211" pid="uva-lib:350477"/>
theatre of her vices. Actuated by a new caprice, she <reg orig="de-|termined">determined</reg> <lb/>
to travel through the Southern States. Early <reg orig="in-|dulgence">indulgence</reg> <lb/>
was the cause of her ruin, but her parents had <lb/>
given her the embellishments of a fashionable education. <lb/>
She delighted to assume all parts, and personate the most <lb/>
opposite characters. She now resolved to carry a new <lb/>
name and the mask of virtue, into scenes hitherto unvisited.</p>
<p>She journeyed as far as Charleston. Here she met an <lb/>
inexperienced youth, lately arrived from England, and in <lb/>
possession of an ample fortune. Her speciousness and <lb/>
artifices seduced him into a precipitate marriage. Her <lb/>
true character, however, could not be long concealed by <lb/>
herself, and her vices had been too conspicuous, for her <lb/>
long to escape recognition. Her husband was infatuated <lb/>
by her blandishments. To abandon her, or to contemplate <lb/>
her depravity with unconcern, were equally beyond his <lb/>
power. Romantic in his sentiments, his fortitude was <reg orig="une-|qual">unequal</reg> <lb/>
to his disappointments, and he speedily sunk into the <lb/>
grave. By a similar refinement in generosity, he <reg orig="bequeath-|ed">bequeathed</reg> <lb/>
to her his property.</p>
<p>With this accession of wealth, she returned to her ancient <lb/>
abode. The mask, lately worn, seemed preparing to be <lb/>
thrown aside, and her profligate habits to be resumed with <lb/>
more eagerness than ever, but an unexpected and total <lb/>
revolution was effected, by the exhortations of a Methodist <lb/>
divine. Her heart seemed, on a sudden, to be remoulded, <lb/>
her vices and the abettors of them were abjured, she shut <lb/>
out the intrusions of society, and prepared to expiate, by <lb/>
the rigors of abstinence and the bitterness of tears, the <lb/>
offences of her past life.</p>
<p>In this, as in her former career, she was unacquainted <lb/>
with restraint and moderation. Her remorses gained strength, <lb/>
in proportion as she cherished them. She brooded over <lb/>
the images of her guilt, till the possibility of forgiveness and <lb/>
remission disappeared. Her treatment of her daughter and <lb/>
her husband constituted the chief source of her torment. <lb/>
Her awakened conscience refused her a momentary respite <lb/>
from its persecutions. Her thoughts became, by rapid <reg orig="de-|grees">degrees</reg>, <lb/>
tempestuous and gloomy, and it was at length evident, <lb/>
that her condition was maniacal.</p>
<pb n="199" entity="eaf033v5_0212" pid="uva-lib:350478"/>
<p>In this state, she was to me an object, no longer of terror, <lb/>
but compassion. She was surrounded by hirelings, devoid <lb/>
of personal attachment, and anxious only to convert her <lb/>
misfortunes to their own advantage. This evil it was my <lb/>
duty to obviate. My presence for a time, only enhanced <lb/>
the vehemence of her malady, but at length it was only by <lb/>
my attendance and soothing, that she was diverted from the <lb/>
fellest purposes. Shocking execrations and outrages, <reg orig="reso-|lutions">resolutions</reg> <lb/>
and efforts to destroy herself and those around her, <lb/>
were sure to take place in my absence. The moment I <lb/>
appeared before her, her fury abated; her gesticulations <lb/>
were becalmed, and her voice exerted only in incoherent <lb/>
and pathetic lamentations.</p>
<p>These scenes, though so different from those which I had <lb/>
formerly been condemned to witness, were scarcely less <reg orig="ex-|cruciating">excruciating</reg>. <lb/>
The friendship of Constantia Dudley was my <lb/>
only consolation. She took up her abode with me, and <lb/>
shared with me every disgustful and perilous office, which <lb/>
my mother's insanity prescribed.</p>
<p>Of this consolation, however, it was my fate to be <reg orig="be-|reaved">bereaved</reg>. <lb/>
My mother's state was deplorable, and no remedy <lb/>
hitherto employed, was efficacious. A voyage to England, <lb/>
was conceived likely to benefit, by change of temperature <lb/>
and scenes, and by the opportunity it would afford of trying <lb/>
the superior skill of English physicians. This scheme, after <lb/>
various struggles, on my part, was adopted. It was <reg orig="detesta-|ble">detestable</reg> <lb/>
to my imagination, because it severed me from that friend, <lb/>
in whose existence mine was involved, and without whose <lb/>
participation, knowledge lost its attractions, and society <reg orig="be-|came">became</reg> <lb/>
a torment.</p>
<p>The prescriptions of my duty could not be disguised or <lb/>
disobeyed, and we parted. A mutual engagement was <lb/>
formed, to record every sentiment and relate every event <lb/>
that happened, in the life of either, and no opportunity of <lb/>
communicating information, was to be omitted. This <reg orig="en-|gagement">engagement</reg> <lb/>
was punctually performed on my part. I sought <lb/>
out every method of conveyance to my friend, and took <reg orig="in-|finite">infinite</reg> <lb/>
pains to procure tidings from her, but all were <reg orig="in-|effectual">ineffectual</reg>.</p>
<p>My mother's malady declined, but was succeeded by a <lb/>
pulmonary disease, which threatened her speedy destruction. <lb/>
<pb n="200" entity="eaf033v5_0213" pid="uva-lib:350479"/>
By the restoration of her understanding, the purpose of her <lb/>
voyage was obtained, and my impatience to return, which <lb/>
the inexplicable and ominous silence of my friend daily <reg orig="in-|creased">increased</reg>, <lb/>
prompted me to exert all my powers of persuasion, <lb/>
to induce her to revisit America.</p>
<p>My mother's frenzy was a salutary crisis in her moral <lb/>
history. She looked back upon her past conduct with <reg orig="un-|speakable">unspeakable</reg> <lb/>
loathing, but this retrospect only invigorated her <lb/>
devotion and her virtue; but the thought of returning to the <lb/>
scene of her unhappiness and infamy could not be endured. <lb/>
Besides, life in her eyes, possessed considerable attractions, <lb/>
and her physicians flattered her with recovery from her <lb/>
present disease, if she would change the atmosphere of <reg orig="Eng-|land">England</reg> <lb/>
for that of Languedoc and Naples.</p>
<p>I followed her with murmurs and reluctance. To desert <lb/>
her in her present critical state would have been inhuman. <lb/>
My mother's aversions and attachments, habits and views <lb/>
were dissonant with my own. Conformity of sentiments <lb/>
and impressions of maternal tenderness, did not exist to bind <lb/>
us to each other. My attendance was assiduous, but it was <lb/>
the sense of duty that rendered my attendance a <reg orig="supporta-|ble">supportable</reg> <lb/>
task.</p>
<p>Her decay was eminently gradual. No time seemed to <lb/>
diminish her appetite for novelty and change. During three <lb/>
years we traversed every part of France, Switzerland and <lb/>
Italy. I could not but attend to surrounding scenes, and <lb/>
mark the progress of the mighty revolution, whose effects, <lb/>
like agitation in a fluid, gradually spread from Paris, the <lb/>
centre, over the face of the neighboring kingdoms; but <lb/>
there passed not a day or an hour in which the image of <lb/>
Constantia was not recalled, in which the most pungent <lb/>
regrets were not felt at the inexplicable silence which had <lb/>
been observed by her, and the most vehement longings <reg orig="in-|dulged">indulged</reg> <lb/>
to return to my native country. My exertions to <lb/>
ascertain her condition by indirect means, by interrogating <lb/>
natives of America, with whom I chanced to meet, were <lb/>
unwearied, but, for a long period, ineffectual.</p>
<p>During this pilgrimage, Rome was thrice visited. My <lb/>
mother's indisposition was hastening to a crisis, and she <lb/>
formed the resolution of closing her life at the bottom of <lb/>
Vesuvius. We stopped, for the sake of a few day's repose, <lb/>
<pb n="201" entity="eaf033v5_0214" pid="uva-lib:350480"/>
at Rome. On the morning after our arrival, I accompanied <lb/>
some friends to view the public edifices. Casting my eyes <lb/>
over the vast and ruinous interior of the Coliseo, my <reg orig="atten-|tion">attention</reg> <lb/>
was fixed by the figure of a young man, whom, after a <lb/>
moment's pause, I recollected to have seen in the streets of <lb/>
New York. At a distance from home, mere community of <lb/>
country is no inconsiderable bond of affection. The social <lb/>
spirit prompts us to cling even to inanimate objects, when <lb/>
they remind us of ancient fellowships and juvenile <reg orig="attach-|ments">attachments</reg>.</p>
<p>A servant was despatched to summon this stranger, who <lb/>
recognised a country-woman with a pleasure equal to that <lb/>
which I had received. On nearer view, this person, whose <lb/>
name was Courtland, did not belie my favorable <reg orig="preposses-|sions">prepossessions</reg>. <lb/>
Our intercourse was soon established on a footing <lb/>
of confidence and intimacy.</p>
<p>The destiny of Constantia was always uppermost in my <lb/>
thoughts. This person's acquaintance was originally sought, <lb/>
chiefly in the hope of obtaining from him some information <lb/>
respecting my friend. On inquiry I discovered that he had <lb/>
left his native city, seven months after me. Having tasked <lb/>
his recollection and compared a number of facts, the name <lb/>
of Dudley at length reoccurred to him. He had casually <lb/>
heard the history of Craig's imposture and its consequences. <lb/>
These were now relate as circumstantially as a memory, <lb/>
occupied by subsequent incidents, enabled him. The tale <lb/>
had been told to him, in a domestic circle which he was <reg orig="ac-|customed">accustomed</reg> <lb/>
to frequent, by the person who purchased Mr. <lb/>
Dudley's lute, and restored it to its previous owner, on the <lb/>
conditions formerly mentioned.</p>
<p>This tale filled me with anguish and doubt. My <reg orig="impa-|tience">impatience</reg> <lb/>
to search out this unfortunate girl, and share with her <lb/>
her sorrows or relieve them, was anew excited by this <lb/>
mournful intelligence. That Constantia Dudley was <reg orig="reduc-|ed">reduced</reg> <lb/>
to beggary, was too abhorrent to my feelings to receive <lb/>
credit, yet the sale of her father's property, comprising even <lb/>
his furniture and clothing, seemed to prove that she had <lb/>
fallen even to this depth. This enabled me in some degree <lb/>
to account for her silence. Her generous spirit would <reg orig="in-|duce">induce</reg> <lb/>
her to conceal misfortunes from her friend, which no <lb/>
<pb n="202" entity="eaf033v5_0215" pid="uva-lib:350481"/>
communication would alleviate. It was possible that she <lb/>
had selected some new abode, and that in consequence, the <lb/>
letters I had written, and which amounted to volumes, had <lb/>
never reached her hands.</p>
<p>My mother's state would not suffer me to obey the <reg orig="im-|pulse">impulse</reg> <lb/>
of my heart. Her frame was verging towards <reg orig="dis-|solution">dissolution</reg>. <lb/>
Courtland's engagements allowed him to <reg orig="accom-|pany">accompany</reg> <lb/>
us to Naples, and here the long series of my mother's <lb/>
pilgrimages, closed in death. Her obsequies were no sooner <lb/>
performed, than I determined to set out on my long <reg orig="pro-|jected">projected</reg> <lb/>
voyage. My mother's property, which, in <reg orig="conse-|quence">consequence</reg> <lb/>
of her decease, devolved upon me, was not <reg orig="incon-|siderable">inconsiderable</reg>. <lb/>
There is scarcely any good so dear, to a <lb/>
rational being, as competence. I was not unacquainted <lb/>
with its benefits, but this acquisition was valuable to me <lb/>
chiefly as it enabled me to reunite my fate to that of <reg orig="Con-|stantia">Constantia</reg>.</p>
<p>Courtland was my countryman and friend. He was <lb/>
destitute of fortune, and had been led to Europe partly by <lb/>
the spirit of adventure, and partly on a mercantile project. <lb/>
He had made sale of his property, on advantageous terms, <lb/>
in the ports of France, and resolved to consume the <reg orig="pro-|duce">produce</reg> <lb/>
in examining this scene of heroic exploits and <reg orig="me-|morable">memorable</reg> <lb/>
revolutions. His slender stock, though frugally <lb/>
and even parsimoniously administered, was nearly <reg orig="exhaust-|ed">exhausted</reg>, <lb/>
and at the time of our meeting at Rome, he was making <lb/>
reluctant preparations to return.</p>
<p>Sufficient opportunity was afforded us, in an unrestrained <lb/>
and domestic intercourse of three months, which <reg orig="succeed-|ed">succeeded</reg> <lb/>
our Roman interview, to gain a knowledge of each <lb/>
other. There was that conformity of tastes and views <lb/>
between us, which could scarcely fail, at an age, and in a <lb/>
situation like ours, to give birth to tenderness. My <reg orig="resolu-|tion">resolution</reg> <lb/>
to hasten to America, was peculiarly unwelcome to my <lb/>
friend. He had offered to be my companion, but this offer, <lb/>
my regard to his interest obliged me to decline; but I was <lb/>
willing to compensate him for this denial, as well as to <lb/>
gratify my own heart, by an immediate marriage.</p>
<p>So long a residence in England and Italy, had given <lb/>
birth to friendships and connexions of the dearest kind. <lb/>
<pb n="203" entity="eaf033v5_0216" pid="uva-lib:350482"/>
I had no view but to spend my life with Courtland, in the <lb/>
midst of my maternal kindred, who were English. A <lb/>
voyage to America, and reunion with Constantia were <reg orig="pre-|viously">previously</reg> <lb/>
indispensable, but I hoped that my friend might be <lb/>
prevailed upon, and that her disconnected situation would <lb/>
permit her to return with me to Europe. If this end could <lb/>
not be accomplished, it was my inflexible purpose to live and <lb/>
to die with her. Suitably to this arrangement, Courtland <lb/>
was to repair to London, and wait patiently till I should be <lb/>
able to rejoin him there, or to summon him to meet me in <lb/>
America.</p>
<p>A week after my mother's death, I became a wife, and <lb/>
embarked, the next day, at Naples, in a Ragusan ship, <reg orig="des-|tined">destined</reg> <lb/>
for New-York. The voyage was tempestuous and <lb/>
tedious. The vessel was necessitated to make a short stay <lb/>
at Toulon. The state of that city, however, then in <reg orig="pos-|session">possession</reg> <lb/>
of the English, and besieged by the revolutionary <lb/>
forces, was adverse to commercial views. Happily, we <reg orig="re-|sumed">resumed</reg> <lb/>
our voyage, on the day previous to that on which the <lb/>
place was evacuated by the British. Our seasonable <reg orig="de-|parture">departure</reg> <lb/>
rescued us from witnessing a scene of horrors, of <lb/>
which the history of former wars, furnish us with few <reg orig="ex-|amples">examples</reg>.</p>
<p>A cold and boisterous navigation awaited us. My <reg orig="pal-|pitations">palpitations</reg> <lb/>
and inquietudes augmented as we approached the <lb/>
American coast. I shall not forget the sensations which I <lb/>
experienced on the sight of the Beacon at Sandy-Hook. <lb/>
It was first seen at midnight, in a stormy and beclouded <lb/>
atmosphere, emerging from the waves, whose fluctuation <lb/>
allowed it, for some time, to be visible only by fits. This <lb/>
token of approaching land, affected me as much as if I had <lb/>
reached the threshold of my friend's dwelling.</p>
<p>At length we entered the port, and I viewed, with high <lb/>
raised, but inexplicable feelings, objects with which I had <lb/>
been from infancy familiar. The flag-staff erected on the <lb/>
battery, recalled to my imagination the pleasures of the <lb/>
evening and morning walks, which I had taken on that spot, <lb/>
with the lost Constantia. The dream was fondly cherished, <lb/>
that the figure which I saw, loitering along the terrace was <lb/>
her's.</p>
<pb n="204" entity="eaf033v5_0217" pid="uva-lib:350483"/>
<p>On disembarking, I gazed at every female passenger, in <lb/>
hope that it was she whom I sought. An absence of three <lb/>
years, had obliterated from my memory none of the images <lb/>
which attended me on my departure.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXIV.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">After</hi> a night of repose rather than of sleep, I began <lb/>
the search after my friend. I went to the house which the <lb/>
Dudleys formerly inhabited, and which had been the <reg orig="asy-|lum">asylum</reg> <lb/>
of my infancy. It was now occupied by strangers, by <lb/>
whom no account could be given of its former tenants. I <lb/>
obtained directions to the owner of the house. He was <reg orig="equal-|ly">equally</reg> <lb/>
unable to satisfy my curiosity. The purchase had been <lb/>
made at a public sale, and terms had been settled not with <lb/>
Dudley, but with the sheriff.</p>
<p>It is needless to say, that the history of Craig's <reg orig="impos-|ture">imposture</reg> <lb/>
and its consequences, were confirmed by every one <lb/>
who resided at that period in New York. The Dudleys <lb/>
were well remembered, and their disappearance, immediately <lb/>
after their fall, had been generally noticed, but whither they <lb/>
had retired, was a problem which no one was able to solve.</p>
<p>This evasion was strange. By what motives the <reg orig="Dud-|leys">Dudleys</reg> <lb/>
were induced to change their ancient abode, could be <lb/>
vaguely guessed. My friend's grandfather was a native of <lb/>
the West Indies. Descendants of the same stock still <reg orig="resid-|ed">resided</reg> <lb/>
in Tobago. They might be affluent, and to them it was <lb/>
possible, that Mr. Dudley, in this change of fortune, had <reg orig="be-|taken">betaken</reg> <lb/>
himself for relief. This was a mournful expedient, <lb/>
since it would raise a barrier between my friend and myself <lb/>
scarcely to be surmounted.</p>
<p>Constantia's mother was stolen by Mr. Dudley from a <lb/>
convent at Amiens. There were no affinities, therefore, to <lb/>
draw them to France. Her grandmother was a native of <lb/>
Baltimore, of a family of some note, by name Ridgeley. <lb/>
This family might still exist, and have either afforded an <lb/>
asylum to the Dudleys, or, at least, be apprised of their <reg orig="des-|tiny">destiny</reg>. <lb/>
It was obvious to conclude that they no longer <reg orig="exist-|ed">existed</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="205" entity="eaf033v5_0218" pid="uva-lib:350484"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">18</fw></pb>
within the precincts of New York. A journey to <reg orig="Balti-|more">Baltimore</reg> <lb/>
was the next expedient.</p>
<p>This journey was made in the depth of winter, and by the <lb/>
speediest conveyance. I made no more than a day's <reg orig="so-|journ">sojourn</reg> <lb/>
in Philadelphia. The epidemic by which that city had <lb/>
been lately ravaged, I had not heard of it till my arrival in <lb/>
America. Its devastations were then painted to my fancy <lb/>
in the most formidable colors. A few months only had <lb/>
elapsed since its extinction, and I expected to see numerous <lb/>
marks of misery and depopulation.</p>
<p>To my no small surprise, however, no vestiges of this <reg orig="ca-|lamity">calamity</reg> <lb/>
were to be discerned. All houses were open, all <lb/>
streets thronged, and all faces thoughtless or busy. The <lb/>
arts and the amusements of life seemed as sedulously <reg orig="culti-|vated">cultivated</reg> <lb/>
as ever. Little did I then think what had been, and <lb/>
what, at that moment, was the condition of my friend. I <lb/>
stopped for the sake of respite from fatigue, and did not, <reg orig="there-|fore">therefore</reg>, <lb/>
pass much time in the streets. Perhaps, had I walked <lb/>
seasonably abroad, we might have encountered each other, <lb/>
and thus have saved ourselves from a thousand anxieties.</p>
<p>At Baltimore I made myself known, without the <reg orig="forma-|lity">formality</reg> <lb/>
of introduction, to the Ridgeleys. They acknowledged <lb/>
their relationship to Mr. Dudley, but professed absolute <reg orig="ig-|norance">ignorance</reg> <lb/>
of his fate. Indirect intercourse only had been <lb/>
maintained, formerly, by Dudley with his mother's kindred. <lb/>
They had heard of his misfortune, a twelvemonth after it <lb/>
happened, but what measures had been subsequently <reg orig="pursu-|ed">pursued</reg>, <lb/>
their kinsman had not thought proper to inform them.</p>
<p>The failure of this expedient almost bereft me of hope. <lb/>
Neither my own imagination nor the Ridgeleys, could <reg orig="sug-|gest">suggest</reg> <lb/>
any new mode by which my purpose was likely to be <lb/>
accomplished. To leave America, without obtaining the <lb/>
end of my visit, could not be thought of without agony, and <lb/>
yet the continuance of my stay promised me no relief from <lb/>
my uncertainties.</p>
<p>On this theme I ruminated without ceasing. I <reg orig="recall-|ed">recalled</reg> <lb/>
every conversation and incident of former times, and <lb/>
sought in them a clue, by which my present conjectures <lb/>
might be guided. One night, immersed alone in my <reg orig="cham-|ber">chamber</reg>, <lb/>
my thoughts were thus employed. My train of <reg orig="medi-|tation">meditation</reg> <lb/>
was, on this occasion, new. From the review of <reg orig="par-|ticulars">particulars</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="206" entity="eaf033v5_0219" pid="uva-lib:350485"/>
from which no satisfaction had hitherto been gained, <lb/>
I passed to a vague and comprehensive retrospect.</p>
<p>Mr. Dudley's early life, his profession of a painter, his <lb/>
zeal in this pursuit, and his reluctance to quit it, were <reg orig="re-|membered">remembered</reg>. <lb/>
Would he not revert to this profession, when <lb/>
other means of subsistence were gone. It is true, similar <lb/>
obstacles with those which had formerly occasioned his <reg orig="re-|sort">resort</reg> <lb/>
to a different path, existed at present, and no painter of <lb/>
his name was to be found in Philadelphia, Baltimore, or New <lb/>
York. But would it not occur to him, that the patronage <lb/>
denied to his skill, by the frugal and unpolished habits of his <lb/>
countrymen, might with more probability of success, be <lb/>
sought from the opulence and luxury of London? Nay, had <lb/>
he not once affirmed in my hearing, that if he ever were <reg orig="re-|duced">reduced</reg> <lb/>
to poverty, this was the method he would pursue?</p>
<p>This conjecture was too bewitching to be easily dismissed. <lb/>
Every new reflection augmented its force. I was suddenly <lb/>
raised by it from the deepest melancholy to the region of <lb/>
lofty and gay hopes. Happiness, of which I had began to <lb/>
imagine myself irretrievably bereft, seemed once more to <lb/>
approach within my reach. Constantia would not only be <lb/>
found, but be met in the midst of those comforts which her <lb/>
father's skill could not fail to procure, and on that very stage <lb/>
where I most desired to encounter her. Mr. Dudley had <lb/>
many friends and associates of his youth in London. Filial <lb/>
duty had repelled their importunities to fix his abode in <reg orig="Eu-|rope">Europe</reg>, <lb/>
when summoned home by his father. On his father's <lb/>
death these solicitations had been renewed, but were <reg orig="disre-|garded">disregarded</reg> <lb/>
for reasons, which he, afterwards, himself confessed, <lb/>
were fallacious. That they would, a third time be preferred, <lb/>
and would regulate his conduct, seemed to me incontestable.</p>
<p>I regarded with wonder and deep regret, the infatuation <lb/>
that had hitherto excluded these images from my <reg orig="understand-|ing">understanding</reg> <lb/>
and my memory. How many dangers and toils had I <lb/>
endured since my embarkation at Naples, to the present <lb/>
moment? How many lingering minutes had I told since my <lb/>
first interview with Courtland? All were owing to my own <reg orig="stu-|pidity">stupidity</reg>. <lb/>
Had my present thoughts been seasonably suggested, <lb/>
I might long since have been restored to the embraces of <lb/>
my friend, without the necessity of an hour's separation <lb/>
from my husband.</p>
<pb n="207" entity="eaf033v5_0220" pid="uva-lib:350486"/>
<p>These were evils to be repaired as far as it was possible. <lb/>
Nothing now remained but to procure a passage to Europe. <lb/>
For this end diligent inquiries were immediately set on foot. <lb/>
A vessel was found, which, in a few weeks, would set out upon <lb/>
the voyage. Having bespoken a conveyance, it was <reg orig="incum-|bent">incumbent</reg> <lb/>
on me to sustain with patience the unwelcome delay.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, my mind, delivered from the dejection and <lb/>
perplexities that lately haunted it, was capable of some <reg orig="at-|tention">attention</reg> <lb/>
to surrounding objects. I marked the peculiarities <lb/>
of manners and language in my new abode, and studied the <lb/>
effects which a political and religious system, so opposite to <lb/>
that with which I had conversed, in Italy and Switzerland, <lb/>
had produced. I found that the difference between Europe <lb/>
and America, lay chiefly in this; that, in the former, all <lb/>
things tended to extremes, whereas, in the latter, all things <lb/>
tended to the same level. Genius, and virtue, and <reg orig="happi-|ness">happiness</reg> <lb/>
on these shores, were distinguished by a sort of <reg orig="medioc-|rity">mediocrity</reg>. <lb/>
Conditions were less unequal, and men were strangers <lb/>
to the heights of enjoyment and the depths of misery, to <lb/>
which the inhabitants of Europe are accustomed.</p>
<p>I received friendly notice and hospitable treatment from <lb/>
the Ridgeleys. These people were mercantile and plodding <lb/>
in their habits. I found in their social circle, little exercise <lb/>
for the sympathies of my heart, and willingly accepted their <lb/>
aid to enlarge the sphere of my observation.</p>
<p>About a week before my intended embarkation, and when <lb/>
suitable preparation had been made for that event, a lady <reg orig="ar-|rived">arrived</reg> <lb/>
in town, who was cousin to my Constantia. She had <lb/>
frequently been mentioned in favorable terms, in my hearing. <lb/>
She had passed her life, in a rural abode with her father, <lb/>
who cultivated his own domain, lying forty miles from <reg orig="Bal-|timore">Baltimore</reg>.</p>
<p>On an offer being made to introduce us to each other, I <lb/>
consented to know one whose chief recommendation, in my <lb/>
eyes, consisted in her affinity to Constantia Dudley. I found <lb/>
an artless and attractive female, unpolished and undepraved <lb/>
by much intercourse with mankind. At first sight, I was <lb/>
powerfully struck by the resemblances of her features to <lb/>
those of my friend, which sufficiently denoted their <reg orig="connex-|ion">connexion</reg> <lb/>
with a common stock.</p>
<pb n="208" entity="eaf033v5_0221" pid="uva-lib:350487"/>
<p>The first interview afforded mutual satisfaction. On our <lb/>
second meeting, discourse insensibly led to the mention of <lb/>
Miss Dudley, and of the design which had brought me to <lb/>
America. She was deeply affected by the earnestness with <lb/>
which I expatiated on her cousin's merits, and by the proofs <lb/>
which my conduct had given of unlimited attachment.</p>
<p>I dwelt immediately on the measures which I had hitherto <lb/>
ineffectually pursued to trace her footsteps, and detailed the <lb/>
grounds of my present belief, that we should meet in <reg orig="Lon-|don">London</reg>. <lb/>
During this recital, my companion sighed and wept. <lb/>
When I finished my tale, her tears, instead of ceasing, <reg orig="flow-|ed">flowed</reg> <lb/>
with new vehemence. This appearance excited some <lb/>
surprise, and I ventured to ask the cause of her grief.</p>
<p>Alas! She replied, I am personally a strnager to my <lb/>
cousin, but her character has been amply displayed to me <lb/>
by one who knew her well. I weep to think how much she <lb/>
has suffered. How much excellence we have lost!</p>
<p>Nay, said I, all her sufferings will, I hope, be compensated, <lb/>
and I by no means consider her as lost. If my search in <lb/>
London be unsuccessful, then shall I indeed despair.</p>
<p>Despair then, already, said my sobbing companion, for <lb/>
your search will be unsuccessful. How I feel for your <reg orig="dis-|appointment">disappointment</reg>! <lb/>
but it cannot be known too soon. My cousin <lb/>
is dead!</p>
<p>These tidings were communicated with tokens of sincerity <lb/>
and sorrow, that left me no room to doubt that they were <lb/>
believed by the relater. My own emotions were suspended <lb/>
till interrogations had obtained a knowledge of her reasons <lb/>
for crediting this fatal event, and till she had explained the <lb/>
time and manner of her death. A friend of Miss Ridgeley's <lb/>
father had witnessed the devastations of the yellow fever in <lb/>
Philadelphia. He was apprised of the relationship that <reg orig="sub-|sisted">subsisted</reg> <lb/>
between his friend and the Dudleys. He gave a <reg orig="mi-|nute">minute</reg> <lb/>
and circumstantial account of the arts of Craig. He <lb/>
mentioned the removal of my friends to Philadelphia, their <lb/>
obscure and indigent life, and finally, their falling victims to <lb/>
the pestilence.</p>
<p>He related the means by which he became apprised of <lb/>
their fate, and drew a picture of their death, surpassing all <lb/>
that imagination can conceive of shocking and deplorable. <lb/>
<pb n="209" entity="eaf033v5_0222" pid="uva-lib:350488"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">18*</fw></pb>
The quarter where they lived was nearly desolate. Their <lb/>
house was shut up, and, for a time, imagined to be <reg orig="uninhabit-|ed">uninhabited</reg>. <lb/>
Some suspicions being awakened, in those who <reg orig="super-|intended">superintended</reg> <lb/>
the burial of the dead, the house was entered, and <lb/>
the father and child discovered to be dead. The former <lb/>
was stretched upon his wretched pallet, while the daughter <lb/>
was found on the floor of the lower room, in a state that <reg orig="de-|noted">denoted</reg> <lb/>
the sufferance, not only of disease, but of famine.</p>
<p>This tale was false. Subsequent discoveries proved this <lb/>
to be a detestable artifice of Craig, who, stimulated by <reg orig="incu-|rable">incurable</reg> <lb/>
habits, had invented these disasters, for the purpose of <lb/>
enhancing the opinion of his humanity, and of furthering his <lb/>
views on the fortune and daughter of Mr. Ridgeley.</p>
<p>Its falsehood, however, I had as yet no means of <reg orig="ascer-|taining">ascertaining</reg>. <lb/>
I received it as true, and at once dismissed all my <lb/>
claims upon futurity. All hopes of happiness, in this <reg orig="muta-|ble">mutable</reg> <lb/>
and sublunary scene, was fled. Nothing remained, but <lb/>
to join my friend in a world, where woes are at an end and <lb/>
virtue finds recompense. Surely, said I, there will <reg orig="some-|time">sometime</reg> <lb/>
be a close to calamity and discord. To those whose <lb/>
lives have been blameless, but harassed by inquietudes, to <lb/>
which not their own, but the errors of others have given birth, <lb/>
a fortress will hereafter be assigned unassailable by change, <lb/>
impregnable to sorrow.</p>
<p>O! my ill-fated Constantia! I will live to cherish thy <lb/>
remembrance, and to emulate thy virtue. I will endure <lb/>
the privation of thy friendship and the vicissitudes that shall <lb/>
befall me, and draw my consolation and courage, from the <lb/>
foresight of no distant close to this terrestrial scene, and of <lb/>
ultimate and everlasting union with thee.</p>
<p>This consideration, though it kept me from confusion <lb/>
and despair, could not, but with the healing aid of time, <reg orig="ren-|der">render</reg> <lb/>
me tranquil or strenuous. My strength was unequal to <lb/>
the struggle of my passions. The ship in which I engaged <lb/>
to embark, could not wait for my restoration to health, and I <lb/>
was left behind.</p>
<p>Mary Ridgeley was artless and affectionate. She saw <lb/>
that her society was dearer to me than that of any other and <lb/>
was therefore seldom willing to leave my chamber. Her <lb/>
presence, less on her own account, than by reason of her <lb/>
<pb n="210" entity="eaf033v5_0223" pid="uva-lib:350489"/>
personal resemblance, and her affinity by birth to Constantia, <lb/>
was a powerful solace.</p>
<p>I had nothing to detain me longer in America. I was <lb/>
anxious to change my present lonely state, for the <reg orig="commu-|nion">communion</reg> <lb/>
of those friends, in England, and the performance of <lb/>
those duties, which were left to me. I was informed that a <lb/>
British Packet, would shortly sail from New York. My frame <lb/>
was sunk into greater weakness, than I had felt at any <reg orig="for-|mer">former</reg> <lb/>
period; and I conceived, that to return to New York, by <lb/>
water, was more commodious than to perform the journey <lb/>
by land.</p>
<p>This arrangement was likewise destined to be <reg orig="disappoint-|ed">disappointed</reg>. <lb/>
One morning I visited, according to my custom, Mary <lb/>
Ridgeley. I found her in a temper somewhat inclined to <lb/>
gaiety. She rallied me, with great archness, on the care <lb/>
with which I had concealed from her a tender engagement, <lb/>
into which I had lately entered.</p>
<p>I supposed myself to comprehend her allusion, and, <reg orig="there-|fore">therefore</reg>, <lb/>
answered that accident rather than design, had made <lb/>
me silent on the subject of marriage. She had hitherto <lb/>
known me by no appellation, but Sophia Courtland. I had <lb/>
thought it needless to inform her, that I was indebted for my <lb/>
name to my husband, Courtland being his name.</p>
<p>All that, said my friend, I know already, and so you <reg orig="sage-|ly">sagely</reg> <lb/>
think that my knowledge goes no farther than that? We <lb/>
are not bound to love our husbands longer than their lives. <lb/>
There is no crime, I believe, in preferring the living to the <lb/>
dead, and most heartily do I congratulate you on your <reg orig="pre-|sent">present</reg> <lb/>
choice.</p>
<p>What mean you? I confess your discourse surpasses <lb/>
my comprehension.</p>
<p>At that moment the bell at the door rung a loud peal. <lb/>
Miss Ridgeley hastened down at this signal, saying, with much <lb/>
significance&mdash;</p>
<p>I am a poor hand at solving a riddle. Here comes one who, <lb/>
if I mistake not, will find no difficulty in clearing up your <lb/>
doubts.</p>
<p>Presently, she came up, and said, with a smile of still <lb/>
greater archness;&mdash;Here is a young gentleman, a friend of <lb/>
mine, to whom I must have the pleasure of introducing you. <lb/>
<pb n="211" entity="eaf033v5_0224" pid="uva-lib:350490"/>
He has come for the special purpose of solving my riddle.&mdash; <lb/>
I attended her to the parlor without hesitation.</p>
<p>She presented me, with great formality, to a youth, whose <lb/>
appearance did not greatly prepossess me in favor of his <lb/>
judgment. He approached me with an air, supercilious and <lb/>
ceremonious, but the moment he caught a glance at my <lb/>
face, he shrunk back, visibly confounded and embarrassed. <lb/>
A pause ensued, in which Miss Ridgeley had opportunity to <lb/>
detect the error into which she had been led, by the vanity <lb/>
of this young man.</p>
<p>How now, Mr. Martynne, said my friend, in a tone of <reg orig="ridi-|cule">ridicule</reg>, <lb/>
is it possible you do not know the lady who is the <lb/>
queen of your affections, the tender and indulgent fair one, <lb/>
whose portrait you carry in your bosom; and whose image <lb/>
you daily and nightly bedew with your tears and kisses?</p>
<p>Mr. Martynne's confusion instead of being subdued by his <lb/>
struggle, only grew more conspicuous, and after a few <reg orig="in-|coherent">incoherent</reg> <lb/>
speeches and apologies, during which he carefully <lb/>
avoided encountering my eyes, he hastily departed.</p>
<p>I applied to my friend, with great earnestness, for an <reg orig="ex-|planation">explanation</reg> <lb/>
of this scene. It seems that, in the course of <reg orig="con-|versation">conversation</reg> <lb/>
with him, on the preceding day, he had suffered <lb/>
a portrait which hung at his breast, to catch Miss Ridgeley's <lb/>
eye. On her betraying a desire to inspect it more nearly, <lb/>
he readily produced it. My image had been too well copied <lb/>
by the artist, not to be instantly recognised.</p>
<p>She concealed her knowledge of the original, and by <lb/>
questions, well adapted to the purpose, easily drew from <lb/>
him confessions that this was the portrait of his mistress. <lb/>
He let fall sundry innuendoes and surmises, tending to <reg orig="im-|press">impress</reg> <lb/>
her with a notion of the rank, fortune and intellectual <lb/>
accomplishments of the nymph, and particularly of the <reg orig="doat-|ing">doating</reg> <lb/>
fondness and measureless confidence, with which she <lb/>
regarded him.</p>
<p>Her imperfect knowledge of my situation, left her in some <lb/>
doubt as to the truth of these pretensions, and she was <reg orig="will-|ing">willing</reg> <lb/>
to ascertain the truth, by bringing about an interview. <lb/>
To guard against evasions and artifice in the lover, she <reg orig="care-|fully">carefully</reg> <lb/>
concealed from him her knowledge of the original, and <lb/>
merely pretended that a friend of her's, was far more <reg orig="beauti-|ful">beautiful</reg> <lb/>
than her whom this picture represented. She added, <lb/>
<pb n="212" entity="eaf033v5_0225" pid="uva-lib:350491"/>
that she expected a visit from her friend the next morning, <lb/>
and was willing, by shewing her to Mr. Martynne, to convince <lb/>
him how much he was mistaken, in supposing the perfections <lb/>
of his mistress unrivalled.</p>
<ornament type="line"/>
</div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="XXV" id="d33">
<head>CHAPTER XXV.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Martynne,</hi> while he expressed his confidence, that the <lb/>
experiment would only confirm his triumph, readily <reg orig="as-|sented">assented</reg> <lb/>
to the proposal, and the interview above described <lb/>
took place accordingly, the next morning. Had he not <lb/>
been taken by surprise, it is likely the address of a man, <lb/>
who possessed no contemptible powers, would have <reg orig="extri-|cated">extricated</reg> <lb/>
him from some of his embarrassment.</p>
<p>That my portrait should be in the possession of one, <lb/>
whom I had never before seen, and whose character and <lb/>
manners entitled him to no respect, was a source of some <lb/>
surprise. This mode of multiplying faces is extremely <lb/>
prevalent in this age, and was eminently characteristic of <lb/>
those with whom I had associated in different parts of <lb/>
Europe. The nature of my thoughts had modified my <lb/>
features into an expression, which my friends were pleased <lb/>
to consider as a model for those who desired to personify <lb/>
the genius of suffering and resignation.</p>
<p>Hence among those whose religion permitted their <reg orig="devo-|tion">devotion</reg> <lb/>
to a picture of a female, the symbols of their chosen <lb/>
deity were added to features and shape that resembled <lb/>
mine. My own caprice, as well as that of others, always <lb/>
dictated a symbolical, and in every new instance, a <reg orig="dif-|ferent">different</reg> <lb/>
accompaniment of this kind. Hence was offered <lb/>
the means of tracing the history of that picture which <reg orig="Mar-|tynne">Martynne</reg> <lb/>
possessed.</p>
<p>It had been accurately examined by Miss Ridgeley, and <lb/>
her description of the frame in which it was placed, instantly <lb/>
informed me that it was the same which, at our parting, I <lb/>
left in the possession of Constantia. My friend and myself <lb/>
were desirous of employing the skill of a Saxon painter, by <lb/>
name Eckstein. Each of us were drawn by him, she with <lb/>
the cincture of Venus, and I with the crescent of Dian. This <lb/>
<pb n="213" entity="eaf033v5_0226" pid="uva-lib:350492"/>
symbol was still conspicuous on the brow of that image, <lb/>
which Miss Ridgeley had examined, and served to identify <lb/>
the original proprietor.</p>
<p>This circumstance tended to confirm my fears that <reg orig="Con-|stantia">Constantia</reg> <lb/>
was dead, since that she would part with this picture <lb/>
during her life, was not to be believed. It was of little <reg orig="mo-|ment">moment</reg> <lb/>
to discover how it came into the hands of the present <lb/>
possessor. Those who carried her remains to the grave, <lb/>
had probably torn it from her neck and afterwards disposed <lb/>
of it for money.</p>
<p>By whatever means, honest or illicit, it had been acquired <lb/>
by Martynne, it was proper that it should be restored to <lb/>
me. It was valuable to me, because it had been the <reg orig="pro-|perty">property</reg> <lb/>
of one whom I loved, and it might prove highly <reg orig="inju-|rious">injurious</reg> <lb/>
to my fame and my happiness, as the tool of this man's <lb/>
vanity, and the attester of his falsehood. I, therefore, wrote <lb/>
him a letter, acquainting him with my reasons for desiring <lb/>
the repossession of this picture, and offering a price for it, <lb/>
at least double its value, as a mere article of traffic. <reg orig="Mar-|tynne">Martynne</reg> <lb/>
accepted the terms. He transmitted the picture, and <lb/>
with it a note, apologizing for the artifice of which he had <lb/>
been guilty, and mentioning, in order to justify his <reg orig="accept-|ance">acceptance</reg> <lb/>
of the price which I had offered, that he had lately <lb/>
purchased it for an equal sum of a goldsmith in <reg orig="Philadel-|phia">Philadelphia</reg>.</p>
<p>This information suggested a new reflection. Constantia <lb/>
had engaged to preserve, for the use of her friend, copious <lb/>
and accurate memorials of her life. Copies of these were, <lb/>
on suitable occasions, to be transmitted to me, during my <lb/>
residence abroad. These I had never received, but it was <lb/>
highly probable that her punctuality, in the performance of <lb/>
the first part of her engagement, had been equal to my own.</p>
<p>What, I asked, had become of these precious memorials? <lb/>
In the wreck of her property were these irretrievably <reg orig="in-|gulfed">ingulfed</reg>? <lb/>
It was not probable that they had been wantonly <lb/>
destroyed. They had fallen, perhaps, into hands careless <lb/>
or unconscious of their value, or still lay, unknown and <reg orig="ne-|glected">neglected</reg>, <lb/>
at the bottom of some closet or chest. Their <reg orig="re-|covery">recovery</reg> <lb/>
might be effected by vehement exertions, or by <lb/>
some miraculous accident. Suitable inquiries, carried on <lb/>
among those who were active in those scenes of calamity, <lb/>
<pb n="214" entity="eaf033v5_0227" pid="uva-lib:350493"/>
might afford some clue by which the fate of the Dudleys, <lb/>
and the disposition of their property, might come into fuller <lb/>
light. These inquiries could be made only in Philadelphia, <lb/>
and thither, for that purpose, I now resolved to repair. <lb/>
There was still an interval of some weeks, before the <reg orig="de-|parture">departure</reg> <lb/>
of the packet in which I proposed to embark.</p>
<p>Having returned to the capital, I devoted all my zeal to <lb/>
my darling project. My efforts, however, were without <lb/>
success. Those who administered charity and succor <lb/>
during that memorable season, and who survived, could <reg orig="re-|move">remove</reg> <lb/>
none of my doubts, nor answer any of my inquiries. <lb/>
Innumerable tales, equally disastrous with those which Miss <lb/>
Ridgeley had heard, were related; but, for a considerable <lb/>
period, none of their circumstances were sufficiently <reg orig="accor-|dant">accordant</reg> <lb/>
with the history of the Dudleys.</p>
<p>It is worthy of remark, in how many ways, and by what <lb/>
complexity of motives, human curiosity is awakened and <lb/>
knowledge obtained. By its connexion with my darling <lb/>
purpose, every event in the history of this memorable pest, <lb/>
was earnestly sought and deeply pondered. The <reg orig="power-|ful">powerful</reg> <lb/>
considerations which governed me, made me slight <lb/>
those punctilious impediments, which, in other <reg orig="circum-|stances">circumstances</reg>, <lb/>
would have debarred me from intercourse with the <lb/>
immediate actors and observers. I found none who were <lb/>
unwilling to expatiate on this topic, or to communicate the <lb/>
knowledge they possessed. Their details were copious in <lb/>
particulars, and vivid in minuteness. They exhibited the <lb/>
state of manners, the diversified effects of evil or heroic <lb/>
passions, and the endless forms which sickness and poverty <lb/>
assume in the obscure recesses of a commercial and <reg orig="popu-|lous">populous</reg> <lb/>
city.</p>
<p>Some of these details are too precious to be lost. It is <lb/>
above all things necessary that we should be thoroughly <reg orig="ac-|quainted">acquainted</reg> <lb/>
with the condition of our fellow-beings. Justice <lb/>
and compassion are the fruit of knowledge. The misery <lb/>
that overspreads so large a part of mankind, exists chiefly <lb/>
because those who are able to relieve it do not know that <lb/>
it exists. Forcibly to paint the evil, seldom fails to excite <lb/>
the virtue of the spectator, and seduce him into wishes, at <lb/>
least, if not into exertions of beneficence.</p>
<p>The circumstances in which I was placed were, perhaps, <lb/>
<pb n="215" entity="eaf033v5_0228" pid="uva-lib:350494"/>
wholly singular. Hence the knowledge I obtained was <lb/>
more comprehensive and authentic than was possessed by <lb/>
any one, even of the immediate actors or sufferers. This <lb/>
knowledge will not be useless to myself or to the world. <lb/>
The motives which dictated the present narrative, will <reg orig="him-|der">himder</reg> <lb/>
me from relinquishing the pen, till my fund of <reg orig="observa-|tion">observation</reg> <lb/>
and experience be exhausted. Meanwhile, let me <lb/>
resume the thread of my tale.</p>
<p>The period allowed me before my departure was nearly <lb/>
expired, and my purpose seemed to be as far from its <reg orig="ac-|complishment">accomplishment</reg> <lb/>
as ever. One evening I visited a lady, who <lb/>
was the widow of a physician, whose disinterested exertions <lb/>
had cost him his life. She dwelt with pathetic earnestness <lb/>
on the particulars of her own distress, and listened with <lb/>
deep attention to the inquiries and doubts which I laid <reg orig="be-|fore">before</reg> <lb/>
her.</p>
<p>After a pause of consideration, she said, that an incident <lb/>
like that related by me, she had previously heard from one <lb/>
of her friends, whose name she mentioned. This person <lb/>
was one of those whose office consisted in searching out the <lb/>
sufferers, and affording them unsought and unsolicited <reg orig="re-|lief">relief</reg>. <lb/>
She was offering to introduce me to this person, when <lb/>
he entered the apartment.</p>
<p>After the usual compliments, my friend led the <reg orig="conversa-|tion">conversation</reg> <lb/>
as I wished. Between Mr. Thompson's tale and that <lb/>
related to Miss Ridgeley, there was an obvious resemblance. <lb/>
The sufferers resided in an obscure alley. They had shut <lb/>
themselves up from all intercourse with their neighbors, and <lb/>
had died, neglected and unknown. Mr. Thompson was <lb/>
vested with the superintendence of this district, and had <lb/>
passed the house frequently without suspicion of its being <lb/>
tenanted.</p>
<p>He was at length informed by one of those who conducted <lb/>
a hearse, that he had seen the window in the upper story of <lb/>
this house lifted, and a female shew herself. It was night, <lb/>
and the hearseman chanced to be passing the door. He <lb/>
immediately supposed that the person stood in need of his <lb/>
services, and stopped.</p>
<p>This procedure was comprehended by the person at the <lb/>
window, who, leaning out, addressed him in a broken and <lb/>
<pb n="216" entity="eaf033v5_0229" pid="uva-lib:350495"/>
feeble voice. She asked him why he had not taken a <reg orig="dif-|ferent">different</reg> <lb/>
route, and upbraided him for inhumanity in leading <lb/>
his noisy vehicle past her door. She wanted repose, but <lb/>
the ceaseless rumbling of his wheels would not allow her the <lb/>
sweet respite of a moment.</p>
<p>This invective was singular, and uttered in a voice which <lb/>
united the utmost degree of earnestness, with a feebleness <lb/>
that rendered it almost inarticulate. The man was at a loss <lb/>
for a suitable answer. His pause only increased the <reg orig="impa-|tience">impatience</reg> <lb/>
of the person at the window, who called upon him, in <lb/>
a still more anxious tone, to proceed, and entreated him to <lb/>
avoid this alley for the future.</p>
<p>He answered that he must come whenever the occasion <lb/>
called him. That three persons now lay dead in this alley, <lb/>
and that he must be expeditious in their removal, but that <lb/>
he would return as seldom and make as little noise as possible.</p>
<p>He was interrupted by new exclamations and upbraidings. <lb/>
These terminated in a burst of tears, and assertions, that <lb/>
God and man were her enemies. That they were <reg orig="deter-|mined">determined</reg> <lb/>
to destroy her, but she trusted that the time would <lb/>
come when their own experience would avenge her wrongs, <lb/>
and teach them some compassion for the misery of others. <lb/>
Saying this, she shut the window with violence, and retired <lb/>
from it sobbing with a vehemence, that could be distinctly <lb/>
overheard by him in the street.</p>
<p>He paused for some time, listening when this passion <lb/>
should cease. The habitation was slight, and he imagined <lb/>
that he heard her traversing the floor. While he staid, she <lb/>
continued to vent her anguish in exclamations and sighs, and <lb/>
passionate weeping. It did not appear that any other <reg orig="per-|son">person</reg> <lb/>
was within.</p>
<p>Mr. Thompson being next day informed of these incidents, <lb/>
endeavored to enter the house, but his signals, though loud <lb/>
and frequently repeated, being unnoticed, he was obliged to <lb/>
gain admission by violence. An old man, and a female, <lb/>
lovely in the midst of emaciation and decay, were discovered <lb/>
without signs of life. The death of the latter appeared to <lb/>
have been very recent.</p>
<p>In examining the house, no traces of other inhabitants <lb/>
were to be found. Nothing, serviceable as food, was <reg orig="dis-|covered">discovered</reg>, <lb/>
but the remnants of mouldy bread scattered on a <lb/>
<pb n="217" entity="eaf033v5_0230" pid="uva-lib:350496"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">19</fw></pb>
table. No information could be gathered from neighbors <lb/>
respecting the condition and name of these unfortunate <lb/>
people. They had taken possession of this house, during <lb/>
the rage of this malady, and refrained from all <reg orig="communica-|tion">communication</reg> <lb/>
with their neighbors.</p>
<p>There was too much resemblance between this and the <lb/>
story formerly heard, not to produce the belief that they <lb/>
related to the same persons. All that remained was to <lb/>
obtain directions to the proprietor of this dwelling, and exact <lb/>
from him all that he knew respecting his tenants.</p>
<p>I found in him a man of worth and affability. He readily <lb/>
related, that a man applied to him for the use of this house, <lb/>
and that the application was received. At the beginning of <lb/>
the pestilence, a numerous family inhabited this tenement, <lb/>
but had died in rapid succession. This new applicant was <lb/>
the first to apprize him of this circumstance, and appeared <lb/>
extremely anxious to enter on immediate possession.</p>
<p>It was intimated to him that danger would arise from the <lb/>
pestilential condition of the house. Unless cleansed and <lb/>
purified, disease would be unavoidably contracted. The <lb/>
inconvenience and hazard, this applicant was willing to <reg orig="en-|counter">encounter</reg>, <lb/>
and, at length, hinted that no alternative was allowed <lb/>
him, by his present landlord, but to lie in the street or to <lb/>
procure some other abode.</p>
<p>What was the external appearance of this person?</p>
<p>He was infirm, past the middle age, of melancholy aspect, <lb/>
and indigent garb. A year had since elapsed, and more <lb/>
characteristic particulars had not been remarked, or were <lb/>
forgotten. The name had been mentioned, but in the midst <lb/>
of more recent and momentous transactions, had vanished <lb/>
from remembrance. Dudley, or Dolby, or Hadley, seemed <lb/>
to approach more nearly than any other sounds.</p>
<p>Permission to inspect the house was readily granted. It <lb/>
had remained, since that period, unoccupied. The furniture <lb/>
and goods were scanty and wretched, and he did not care <lb/>
to endanger his safety, by meddling with them. He <reg orig="be-|lieved">believed</reg> <lb/>
that they had not been removed or touched.</p>
<p>I was insensible of any hazard which attended my visit, <lb/>
and, with the guidance of a servant, who felt as little <reg orig="appre-|hension">apprehension</reg> <lb/>
as myself, hastened to the spot. I found nothing but <lb/>
<pb n="218" entity="eaf033v5_0231" pid="uva-lib:350497"/>
tables and chairs. Clothing was nowhere to be seen. An <lb/>
earthen pot, without handle, and broken, stood upon the <lb/>
kitchen hearth. No other implement or vessel for the <reg orig="pre-|paration">preparation</reg> <lb/>
of food, appeared.</p>
<p>These forlorn appearances were accounted for by the <lb/>
servant, by supposing the house to have been long since <lb/>
rifled of every thing worth the trouble of removal, by the <lb/>
villains who occupied the neighboring houses; this alley, it <lb/>
seems, being noted for the profligacy of its inhabitants.</p>
<p>When I reflected that a wretched hovel like this, had <lb/>
been, probably, the last retreat of the Dudleys, when I <lb/>
painted their sufferings, of which the numberless tales of <lb/>
distress, of which I had lately been an auditor, enabled me <lb/>
to form an adequate conception, I felt as if to lie down and <lb/>
expire on the very spot where Constantia had fallen, was <lb/>
the only sacrifice to friendship, which time had left to me.</p>
<p>From this house I wandered to the field, where the dead <lb/>
had been promiscuously and by hundreds, interred. I <reg orig="count-|ed">counted</reg> <lb/>
the long series of graves, which were closely ranged, <lb/>
and, being recently levelled, exhibited the appearance of a <lb/>
harrowed field. Methought I could have given thousands, <lb/>
to know in what spot the body of my friend lay, that I <lb/>
might moisten the sacred earth with my tears. Boards <reg orig="has-|tily">hastily</reg> <lb/>
nailed together, formed the best receptacle, which the <lb/>
exigencies of the time could grant to the dead. Many <lb/>
corpses were thrown into a single excavation, and all <reg orig="dis-|tinctions">distinctions</reg> <lb/>
founded on merit and rank, were obliterated. <lb/>
The father and child had been placed in the same cart, <lb/>
and thrown into the same hole.</p>
<p>Despairing, by any longer stay in the city, to effect my <lb/>
purpose, and the period of my embarkation being near, I <lb/>
prepared to resume my journey. I should have set out the <lb/>
next day, but a family, with whom I had made acquaintance, <lb/>
expecting to proceed to New York within a week, I <reg orig="con-|sented">consented</reg> <lb/>
to be their companion, and, for that end, to <reg orig="de-|lay">delay</reg> <lb/>
my departure.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I shut myself up in my apartment, and <reg orig="pur-|sued">pursued</reg> <lb/>
avocations, that were adapted to the melancholy tenor <lb/>
of my thoughts. The day, preceding that appointed for <lb/>
my journey, arrived. It was necessary to complete my <reg orig="ar-|rangements">arrangements</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="219" entity="eaf033v5_0232" pid="uva-lib:350498"/>
with the family, with whom I was to travel, and <lb/>
to settle with the lady, whose apartments I occupied.</p>
<p>On how slender threads does our destiny hang! Had not <lb/>
a momentary impulse tempted me to sing my favorite ditty <lb/>
to the harpsichord, to beguile the short interval, during which <lb/>
my hostess was conversing with her visiter in the next <lb/>
apartment, I should have speeded to New York, have <reg orig="em-|barked">embarked</reg> <lb/>
for Europe, and been eternally severed from my <lb/>
friend, whom I believed to have died in phrenzy and <reg orig="beg-|gary">beggary</reg>, <lb/>
but who was alive and affluent, and who sought me <lb/>
with a diligence, scarcely inferior to my own. We imagined <lb/>
ourselves severed from each other, by death or by <reg orig="impassa-|ble">impassable</reg> <lb/>
seas, but, at the moment when our hopes had sunk to <lb/>
the lowest ebb, a mysterious destiny conducted our footsteps <lb/>
to the same spot.</p>
<p>I heard a murmuring exclamation; I heard my hostess <lb/>
call, in a voice of terror, for help; I rushed into the room; <lb/>
I saw one stretched on the floor, in the attitude of death; <lb/>
I sprung forward and fixed my eyes upon her countenance; <lb/>
I clasped my hands and articulated&mdash;Constantia!&mdash;</p>
<p>She speedily recovered from her swoon. Her eyes <lb/>
opened, she moved, she spoke. Still methought it was an <lb/>
illusion of the senses, that created the phantom. I could <lb/>
not bear to withdraw my eyes from her countenance. If <lb/>
they wandered for a moment, I fell into doubt and <reg orig="perplexi-|ty">perplexity</reg>, <lb/>
and again fixed them upon her, to assure myself of her <lb/>
existence.</p>
<p>The succeeding three days were spent in a state of <reg orig="diz-|ziness">dizziness</reg> <lb/>
and intoxication. The ordinary functions of nature <lb/>
were disturbed. The appetite for sleep and for food were <lb/>
confounded and lost, amidst the impetuosities of a master <reg orig="pas-|sion">passion</reg>. <lb/>
To look and to talk to each other, afforded enchanting <lb/>
occupation for every moment. I would not part from her <lb/>
side, but eat and slept, walked, and mused, and read, with <lb/>
my arm locked in her's, and with her breath fanning my <lb/>
cheek.</p>
<p>I have indeed much to learn. Sophia Courtland has never <lb/>
been wise. Her affections disdain the cold dictates of <reg orig="discre-|tion">discretion</reg>, <lb/>
and spurn at every limit, that contending duties and <lb/>
mixed obligations prescribe.</p>
<p>And yet, O! precious inebriation of the heart! O! <reg orig="pre-|eminent">pre-eminent</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="220" entity="eaf033v5_0233" pid="uva-lib:350499"/>
love! What pleasure of reason or of sense, can <lb/>
stand in competition with those attendant upon thee?&mdash; <lb/>
Whether thou hiest to the fanes of a benevolent deity, or <lb/>
layest all thy homage at the feet of one, who most visibly <lb/>
resembles the perfections of our Maker, surely thy sanction <lb/>
is divine; thy boon is happiness!&mdash;</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXVI.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> tumults of curiosity and pleasure did not speedily <lb/>
subside. The story of each other's wanderings, was told <lb/>
with endless amplification and minuteness. Henceforth, the <lb/>
stream of our existence was to mix; we were to act and to <lb/>
think in common; casual witnesses and written testimony <lb/>
should become superfluous. Eyes and ears were to be <lb/>
eternally employed upon the conduct of each other; death <lb/>
when it should come, was not to be deplored, because it was <lb/>
an unavoidable and brief privation to her that should survive. <lb/>
Being, under any modification, is dear, but that state to <lb/>
which death is a passage, is all-desirable to virtue and <reg orig="all-|compensating">all-compensating</reg> <lb/>
to grief.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, precedent events were made the themes of <lb/>
endless conversation. Every incident and passion, in the <lb/>
course of four years, was revived and exhibited. The name <lb/>
of Ormond, was, of course, frequently repeated by my <lb/>
friend. His features and deportment were described. Her <lb/>
meditations and resolutions, with regard to him, fully <reg orig="dis-|closed">disclosed</reg>. <lb/>
My counsel was asked, in what manner it became <lb/>
her to act.</p>
<p>I could not but harbor aversion to a scheme, which should <lb/>
tend to sever me from Constantia, or to give me a <reg orig="competi-|tor">competitor</reg> <lb/>
in her affections. Besides this, the properties of Ormond <lb/>
were of too mysterious a nature, to make him worthy of <reg orig="ac-|ceptance">acceptance</reg>. <lb/>
Little more was known, concerning him, than <lb/>
what he himself had disclosed to the Dudleys, but this <reg orig="know-|ledge">knowledge</reg> <lb/>
would suffice to invalidate his claims.</p>
<p>He had dwelt, in his conversations with Constantia, <reg orig="spar-|ingly">sparingly</reg> <lb/>
on his own concerns. Yet he did not hide from her, <lb/>
that he had been left in early youth, to his own guidance; <lb/>
<pb n="221" entity="eaf033v5_0234" pid="uva-lib:350500"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">19*</fw></pb>
that he had embraced, when almost a child, the trade of <lb/>
arms; that he had found service and promotion in the <reg orig="ar-|mies">armies</reg> <lb/>
of Potemkin and Romanzow; that he had executed <lb/>
secret and diplomatic functions, at Constantinople and <reg orig="Ber-|lin">Berlin</reg>; <lb/>
that, in the latter city, he had met with schemers and <lb/>
reasoners, who aimed at the new modelling of the world, <lb/>
and the subversion of all that has hitherto been conceived <lb/>
elementary and fundamental, in the constitution of man and <lb/>
of government; that some of those reformers had secretly <lb/>
united, to break down the military and monarchical fabric of <lb/>
German policy; that others, more wisely, had devoted their <lb/>
secret efforts, not to overturn, but to build; that, for this end, <lb/>
they embraced an exploring and colonizing project; that he <lb/>
had allied himself to these, and, for the promotion of their <lb/>
projects, had spent six years of his life, in journeys by sea <lb/>
and land, in tracts unfrequented, till then, by any European.</p>
<p>What were the moral or political maxims, which this <reg orig="ad-|venturous">adventurous</reg> <lb/>
and visionary sect had adopted, and what was the <lb/>
seat of their new-born empire, whether on the shore of an <hi rend="italic"><reg orig="Aus-|tral">Austral</reg></hi> <lb/>
continent, or in the heart of desert America, he carefully <lb/>
concealed. These were exhibited or hidden, or shifted, <reg orig="ac-|cording">according</reg> <lb/>
to his purpose. Not to reveal too much, and not to <lb/>
tire curiosity or overtask belief, was his daily labor. He <lb/>
talked of alliance with the family whose name he bore, and <lb/>
who had lost their honors and estates, by the Hanoverian <lb/>
succession to the crown of England.</p>
<p>I had seen too much of innovation and imposture, in <lb/>
France and Italy, not to regard a man like this, with <reg orig="aver-|sion">aversion</reg> <lb/>
and fear. The mind of my friend was wavering and <lb/>
unsuspicious. She had lived at a distance from scenes, <lb/>
where principles are hourly put to the test of experiment; <lb/>
where all extremes of fortitude and pusillanimity are <reg orig="accus-|tomed">accustomed</reg> <lb/>
to meet; where recluse virtue and speculative <reg orig="hero-|ism">heroism</reg> <lb/>
give place as if by magic, to the last excesses of <reg orig="debau-|chery">debauchery</reg> <lb/>
and wickedness; where pillage and murder are <reg orig="en-|grafted">engrafted</reg>, <lb/>
on systems of all-embracing and self-oblivious <reg orig="be-|nevolence">benevolence</reg>; <lb/>
and the good of mankind is professed to be <lb/>
pursued, with bonds of association and covenants of secrecy. <lb/>
Hence my friend had decided without the sanction of <reg orig="expe-|rience">experience</reg>, <lb/>
had allowed herself to wander into untried paths, <lb/>
<pb n="222" entity="eaf033v5_0235" pid="uva-lib:350501"/>
and had hearkened to positions, pregnant with destruction <lb/>
and ignominy.</p>
<p>It was not difficult to exhibit, in their true light, the <reg orig="enor-|mous">enormous</reg> <lb/>
errors of this man, and the danger of prolonging their <lb/>
intercourse. Her assent to accompany me to England, was <lb/>
readily obtained. Too much despatch could not be used, <lb/>
but the disposal of her property must first take place. This <lb/>
was necessarily productive of some delay.</p>
<p>I had been made, contrary to inclination, expert in the <lb/>
management of all affairs, relative to property. My <reg orig="moth-|er's">mother's</reg> <lb/>
lunacy, subsequent disease and death, had imposed <reg orig="up-|on">upon</reg> <lb/>
me obligations and cares, little suitable to my sex and <lb/>
age. They could not be eluded or transferred to others, <lb/>
and, by degrees, experience enlarged my knowledge and <lb/>
familiarized my tasks.</p>
<p>It was agreed that I should visit and inspect my friend's <lb/>
estate, in Jersey, while she remained in her present abode, <lb/>
to put an end to the views and expectations of Ormond, <lb/>
and to make preparation for her voyage. We were <reg orig="recon-|ciled">reconciled</reg> <lb/>
to a temporary separation, by the necessity that <reg orig="pre-|scribed">prescribed</reg> <lb/>
it.</p>
<p>During our residence together, the mind of Constantia <lb/>
was kept in perpetual ferment. The second day after my <lb/>
departure, the turbulence of her feelings began to <reg orig="sub-|side">subside</reg>, <lb/>
and she found herself at leisure to pursue those <reg orig="mea-|sures">measures</reg> <lb/>
which her present situation prescribed.</p>
<p>The time prefixed by Ormond for the termination of his <lb/>
absence, had nearly arrived. Her resolutions respecting <lb/>
this man, lately formed, now occurred to her. Her heart <lb/>
drooped as she revolved the necessity of disuniting their <lb/>
fates; but that this disunion was proper, could not admit of <lb/>
doubt. How information of her present views might be <lb/>
most satisfactorily imparted to him, was a question not <reg orig="in-|stantly">instantly</reg> <lb/>
decided. She reflected on the impetuosity of his <lb/>
character, and conceived that her intentions might be most <lb/>
conveniently unfolded in a letter. This letter she <reg orig="immedi-|ately">immediately</reg> <lb/>
sat down to write. Just then the door opened, and <lb/>
Ormond entered the apartment.</p>
<p>She was somewhat, and for a moment, startled by this <lb/>
abrupt and unlooked for entrance. Yet she greeted him <lb/>
with pleasure. Her greeting was received with coldness. <lb/>
<pb n="223" entity="eaf033v5_0236" pid="uva-lib:350502"/>
A second glance at his countenance informed her that his <lb/>
mind was somewhat discomposed.</p>
<p>Folding his hands on his breast, he stalked to the <reg orig="win-|dow">window</reg>, <lb/>
and looked up at the moon. Presently he withdrew <lb/>
his gaze from this object, and fixed them upon Constantia. <lb/>
He spoke, but his words were produced by a kind of effort.</p>
<p>Fit emblem, he exclaimed, of human versatility! One <lb/>
impediment is gone. I hoped it was the only one, but no; <lb/>
the removal of that merely made room for another. Let <lb/>
this be removed. Well; fate will interplace a third. All <lb/>
our toils will thus be frustrated, and the ruin will finally <reg orig="re-|dound">redound</reg> <lb/>
upon our heads.&mdash;There he stopped.</p>
<p>This strain could not be interpreted by Constantia. She <lb/>
smiled, and without noticing his incoherences, proceeded to <lb/>
inquire into his adventures during their separation. He <reg orig="lis-|tened">listened</reg> <lb/>
to her, but his eyes, fixed upon her's, and his <reg orig="solem-|nity">solemnity</reg> <lb/>
of aspect were immoveable. When she paused, he <lb/>
seated himself close to her, and grasped her hand with a <lb/>
vehemence that almost pained her, said;</p>
<p>Look at me; steadfastly. Can you read my thoughts? <lb/>
Can your discernment reach the bounds of my knowledge <lb/>
and the bottom of my purposes? Catch you not a view of <lb/>
the monsters that are starting into birth <hi rend="italic">here</hi> (and he put his <lb/>
left hand to his forehead.) But you cannot. Should I <lb/>
paint them to you verbally, you would call me jester or <reg orig="de-|ceiver">deceiver</reg>. <lb/>
What pity that you have not instruments for <reg orig="pierc-|ing">piercing</reg> <lb/>
into thoughts!</p>
<p>I presume, said Constantia, affecting cheerfulness, which <lb/>
she did not feel, such instruments would be useless to me. <lb/>
You never scruple to say what you think. Your designs <lb/>
are no sooner conceived than they are expressed. All you <lb/>
know, all you wish, and all you purpose, are known to others <lb/>
as soon as to yourself. No scruples of decorum; no <reg orig="fore-|sight">foresight</reg> <lb/>
of consequences, are obstacles in your way.</p>
<p>True, replied he, all obstacles are trampled under foot, <lb/>
but one.</p>
<p>What is the insuperable one?</p>
<p>Incredulity in him that hears. I must not say what will <lb/>
not be credited. I must not relate feats and avow schemes, <lb/>
when my hearer will say, those feats were never <reg orig="perform-|ed">performed</reg>; <lb/>
these schemes are not your's. I care not if the truth <lb/>
<pb n="224" entity="eaf033v5_0237" pid="uva-lib:350503"/>
of my tenets and the practicability of my purposes, be denied. <lb/>
Still I will openly maintain them; but when my assertions <lb/>
will, themselves, be disbelieved; when it is denied, that I <lb/>
adopt the creed and project the plans, which I affirm to be <lb/>
adopted and projected by me, it is needless to affirm.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, I mean to ascertain the height of the lunar <lb/>
mountains, by travelling to the top of them. Then I will <lb/>
station myself in the tract of the last comet, and wait till its <lb/>
circumvolution suffers me to leap upon it; then by <reg orig="walk-|ing">walking</reg> <lb/>
on its surface, I will ascertain whether it be hot enough <lb/>
to burn my soles. Do you believe that this can be done?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Do you believe, in consequence of my assertion, that I <lb/>
design to do this, and that, in my apprehension, it is easy to <lb/>
be done?</p>
<p>Not; unless I previously believe you to be lunatic.</p>
<p>Then why should I assert my purposes? Why speak, <lb/>
when the hearer will infer nothing from my speech' but that <lb/>
I am either lunatic or liar?</p>
<p>In that predicament, silence is best.</p>
<p>In that predicament, I now stand. I am not going to <lb/>
unfold myself. Just now, I pitied thee for want of eyes. <lb/>
'Twas a foolish compassion. Thou art happy, because thou <lb/>
seest not an inch before thee or behind.&mdash;Here he was for <lb/>
a moment buried in thought; then breaking from his reverie, <lb/>
he said: So; your father is dead?</p>
<p>True, said Constantia, endeavoring to suppress her <reg orig="ris-|ing">rising</reg> <lb/>
emotions, he is no more. It is so recent an event, that <lb/>
I imagined you a stranger to it.</p>
<p>False imagination! Thinkest thou, I would refrain from <lb/>
knowing what so nearly concerns us both? Perhaps your <lb/>
opinion of my ignorance extends beyond this. Perhaps, I <lb/>
know not your fruitless search for a picture. Perhaps, I <lb/>
neither followed you, nor led you to a being called Sophia <lb/>
Courtland. I was not present at the meeting. I am <reg orig="un-|apprized">unapprized</reg> <lb/>
of the effects of your romantic passion for each <lb/>
other. I did not witness the rapturous effusions and <reg orig="inex-|orable">inexorable</reg> <lb/>
counsels of the new comer. I know not the <reg orig="con-|tents">contents</reg> <lb/>
of the letter which you are preparing to write.&mdash;</p>
<p>As he spoke this, the accents of Ormond gradually <reg orig="aug-|mented">augmented</reg> <lb/>
in vehemence. His countenance bespoke a <reg orig="deepen-|ing">deepening</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="225" entity="eaf033v5_0238" pid="uva-lib:350504"/>
inquietude and growing passion. He stopped at the <lb/>
mention of the letter, because his voice was overpowered by <lb/>
emotion. This pause afforded room for the astonishment <lb/>
of Constantia. Her interviews and conversations with me, <lb/>
took place at seasons of general repose, when all doors <lb/>
were fast and avenues shut, in the midst of silence, and in <lb/>
the bosom of retirement. The theme of our discourse was, <lb/>
commonly, too sacred for any ears but our own; disclosures <lb/>
were of too intimate and delicate a nature, for any but a <reg orig="fe-|male">female</reg> <lb/>
audience; they were too injurious to the fame and <lb/>
peace of Ormond, for him to be admitted to partake of <lb/>
them; yet his words implied a full acquaintance with <reg orig="re-|cent">recent</reg> <lb/>
events, and with purposes and deliberations, shrouded, <lb/>
as we imagined, in impenetrable secrecy.</p>
<p>As soon as Constantia recovered from the confusion of these <lb/>
thoughts, she eagerly questioned him; what do you know? <lb/>
How do you know what has happened, or what is intended?</p>
<p>Poor Constantia! he exclaimed, in a tone bitter and <reg orig="sar-|castic">sarcastic</reg>. <lb/>
How hopeless is thy ignorance! To enlighten thee <lb/>
is past my power. What do I know? Every thing. Not <lb/>
a tittle has escaped me. Thy letter is superfluous; I know <lb/>
its contents before they are written. I was to be told that <lb/>
a soldier and a traveller, a man who refused his faith to <lb/>
dreams, and his homage to shadows, merited only scorn <lb/>
and forgetfulness. That thy affections and person were due <lb/>
to another; that intercourse between us was henceforth to <lb/>
cease; that preparation was making for a voyage to Britain, <lb/>
and that Ormond was to walk to his grave alone!</p>
<p>In spite of harsh tones and inflexible features, these words <lb/>
were accompanied with somewhat that betrayed a mind full of <lb/>
discord and agony. Constantia's astonishment was mingled <lb/>
with dejection. The discovery of a passion, deeper and less <lb/>
curable than she suspected; the perception of <reg orig="embarrass-|ments">embarrassments</reg> <lb/>
and difficulties in the path, which she had chosen, that <lb/>
had not previously occurred to her, threw her mind into <reg orig="anx-|ious">anxious</reg> <lb/>
suspense.</p>
<p>The measures she had previously concerted, were still <reg orig="ap-|proved">approved</reg>. <lb/>
To part from Ormond was enjoined by every <reg orig="dic-|tate">dictate</reg> <lb/>
of discretion and duty. An explanation of her motives <lb/>
and views, could not take place more seasonably than at <lb/>
present. Every consideration of justice to herself and <reg orig="hu-|manity">humanity</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="226" entity="eaf033v5_0239" pid="uva-lib:350505"/>
to Ormond, made it desirable that this interview <lb/>
should be the last. By inexplicable means, he had gained a <lb/>
knowledge of her intentions. It was expedient, therefore, <lb/>
to state them with clearness and force. In what words this <lb/>
was to be done, was the subject of momentary deliberation.</p>
<p>Her thoughts were discerned, and her speech anticipated <lb/>
by her companion.&mdash;Why droopest thou, and why thus <lb/>
silent, Constantia? The secret of thy fate will never be <lb/>
detected. Till thy destiny be finished, it will not be the topic <lb/>
of a single fear. But not for thyself, but me, art thou <reg orig="con-|cerned">concerned</reg>. <lb/>
Thou dreadest, yet determinest to confirm my <lb/>
predictions of thy voyage to Europe, and thy severance from <lb/>
me.</p>
<p>Dismiss thy inquietudes on that score. What misery thy <lb/>
scorn and thy rejection are able to inflict, is inflicted already. <lb/>
Thy decision was known to me as soon as it was formed. <lb/>
Thy motives were known. Not an argument or plea of thy <lb/>
counsellor, not a syllable of her invective, not a sound of her <lb/>
persuasive rhetoric escaped my hearing. I know thy decree <lb/>
to be immutable. As my doubts, so my wishes have taken <lb/>
their flight. Perhaps, in the depth of thy ignorance, it was <lb/>
supposed, that I should struggle to reverse thy purpose, by <lb/>
menaces or supplications. That I should boast of the cruelty <lb/>
with which I should avenge an imaginary wrong upon myself. <lb/>
No. All is very well; go. Not a whisper of objection or <lb/>
reluctance, shalt thou hear from me.</p>
<p>If I could think, said Constantia, with tremulous hesitation, <lb/>
that you part from me without anger; that you see the <reg orig="recti-|tude">rectitude</reg> <lb/>
of my proceeding&mdash;</p>
<p>Anger! Rectitude. I prithee peace. I know thou art <lb/>
going. I know that all objection to thy purpose would be <lb/>
vain. Thinkest thou that thy stay, undictated by love, the <lb/>
mere fruit of compassion, would afford me pleasure or crown <lb/>
my wishes? No. I am not so dastardly a wretch. There <lb/>
was something in thy power to bestow, but thy will accords <lb/>
not with thy power. I merit not the boon, and thou refusest <lb/>
it. I am content.</p>
<p>Here Ormond fixed more significant eyes upon her. Poor <lb/>
Constantia! he continued. Shall I warn thee of the danger <lb/>
that awaits thee? For what end! To elude it, is <reg orig="impossi-|ble">impossible</reg>. <lb/>
<pb n="227" entity="eaf033v5_0240" pid="uva-lib:350506"/>
It will come, and thou, perhaps, wilt be unhappy. <lb/>
Foresight, that enables not to shun, only precreates the evil.</p>
<p>Come, it will. Though future, it knows not the empire <lb/>
of contingency. An inexorable and immutable decree <reg orig="en-|joins">enjoins</reg> <lb/>
it. Perhaps, it is thy nature to meet with calmness <lb/>
what cannot be shunned. Perhaps, when it is passed, thy <lb/>
reason will perceive its irrevocable nature, and restore thee <lb/>
to peace. Such is the conduct of the wise, but such, I fear, <lb/>
the education of Constantia Dudley, will debar her from <reg orig="pur-|suing">pursuing</reg>.</p>
<p>Feign would I regard it as the test of thy wisdom. I look <lb/>
upon thy past life. All the forms of genuine adversity have <lb/>
beset thy youth. Poverty, disease, servile labor, a criminal <lb/>
and hapless parent, have been evils which thou hast not <reg orig="un-|gracefully">ungracefully</reg> <lb/>
sustained. An absent friend and murdered father, <lb/>
were added to thy list of woes, and here thy courage was <lb/>
deficient. Thy soul was proof against substantial misery, <lb/>
but sunk into helpless cowardice, at the sight of phantoms.</p>
<p>One more disaster remains. To call it by its true name <lb/>
would be useless or pernicious. Useless, because thou <lb/>
wouldst pronounce its occurrence impossible; pernicious, <lb/>
because, if its possibility were granted, the omen would <reg orig="dis-|tract">distract</reg> <lb/>
thee with fear. How shall I describe it? Is it loss of <lb/>
fame? No. The deed will be unwitnessed by a human <lb/>
creature. Thy reputation will be spotless, for nothing will <lb/>
be done by thee, unsuitable to the tenor of thy past life. <lb/>
Calumny will not be heard to whisper. All that know thee, <lb/>
will be lavish of their eulogies as ever. Their eulogies will <lb/>
be as justly merited. Of this merit thou wilt entertain as <lb/>
just and as adequate conceptions as now.</p>
<p>It is no repetition of the evils thou hast already endured; <lb/>
it is neither drudgery nor sickness, nor privation of friends. <lb/>
Strange perverseness of human reason! It is an evil; it will <lb/>
be thought upon with agony; it will close up all the sources <lb/>
of pleasurable recollection; it will exterminate hope; it will <lb/>
endear oblivion, and push thee into an untimely grave. Yet <lb/>
to grasp it is impossible. The moment we inspect it nearly, <lb/>
it vanishes. Thy claims to human approbation and divine <lb/>
applause, will be undiminished and unaltered by it. The <lb/>
testimony of approving conscience, will have lost none of its <lb/>
explicitness and energy. Yet thou wilt feed upon sighs; <lb/>
<pb n="228" entity="eaf033v5_0241" pid="uva-lib:350507"/>
thy tears will flow without remission; thou wilt grow <reg orig="ena-|mored">enamored</reg> <lb/>
of death, and perhaps will anticipate the stroke of <lb/>
disease.</p>
<p>Yet, perhaps, my prediction is groundless as my <reg orig="know-|ledge">knowledge</reg>. <lb/>
Perhaps, thy discernment will avail, to make thee <lb/>
wise and happy. Perhaps, thou wilt perceive thy privilege <lb/>
of sympathetic and intellectual activity, to be untouched. <lb/>
Heaven grant the non-fulfilment of my prophecy, thy <reg orig="disen-|thralment">disenthralment</reg> <lb/>
from error, and the perpetuation of thy happiness.</p>
<p>Saying this, Ormond withdrew. His words were always <lb/>
accompanied with gestures and looks, and tones, that <reg orig="fasten-|ed">fastened</reg> <lb/>
the attention of the hearer, but the terms of his present <lb/>
discourse, afforded, independently of gesticulation and <reg orig="ut-|terance">utterance</reg>, <lb/>
sufficient motives to attention and remembrance. <lb/>
He was gone, but his image was contemplated by <reg orig="Constan-|tia">Constantia</reg>; <lb/>
his words still rung in her ears.</p>
<p>The letter she designed to compose, was rendered, by <lb/>
this interview, unnecessary. Meanings, of which she and <lb/>
her friend alone were conscious, were discovered by <reg orig="Or-|mond">Ormond</reg>, <lb/>
through some other medium than words; yet that <lb/>
was impossible. A being, unendowed with preternatural <lb/>
attributes, could gain the information which this man <reg orig="pos-|sessed">possessed</reg>, <lb/>
only by the exertion of his senses.</p>
<p>All human precautions had been used, to baffle the <reg orig="at-|tempts">attempts</reg> <lb/>
of any secret witness. She recalled to mind the <lb/>
circumstances, in which conversations with her friend had <lb/>
taken place. All had been retirement, secrecy and silence. <lb/>
The hours usually dedicated to sleep, had been devoted to <lb/>
this better purpose. Much had been said, in a voice, low <lb/>
and scarcely louder than a whisper. To have overheard it <lb/>
at the distance of a few feet, was apparently impossible.</p>
<p>Their conversations had not been recorded by her. It <lb/>
could not be believed, that this had been done by Sophia <lb/>
Courtland. Had Ormond and her friend met, during the <lb/>
interval that had elapsed, between her separation from the <lb/>
latter, and her meeting with the former? Human events <lb/>
are conjoined by links, imperceptible to keenest eyes. Of <lb/>
Ormond's means of information, she was wholly unapprized. <lb/>
Perhaps, accident would, sometime, unfold them. One <lb/>
thing was incontestable. That her schemes and her reasons <lb/>
for adopting them, were known to him.</p>
<pb n="229" entity="eaf033v5_0242" pid="uva-lib:350508"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">20</fw></pb>
<p>What unforeseen effects had that knowledge produced! <lb/>
In what ambiguous terms had he couched his prognostics, <lb/>
of some mighty evil that awaited her! He had given a <reg orig="ter-|rible">terrible</reg>, <lb/>
but contradictory description, of her destiny. An <lb/>
event was to happen, akin to no calamity which she had <lb/>
already endured, disconnected with all which the imagination <lb/>
of man is accustomed to deprecate, capable of urging her <lb/>
to suicide, and yet of a kind, which left it undecided, <reg orig="whe-|ther">whether</reg> <lb/>
she would regard it with indifference.</p>
<p>What reliance should she place upon prophetic <reg orig="incohe-|rences">incoherences</reg>, <lb/>
thus wild? What precautions should she take, <lb/>
against a danger thus inscrutable and imminent?</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXVII.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">These</hi> incidents and reflections were speedily transmitted <lb/>
to me. I had always believed the character and <reg orig="machina-|tions">machinations</reg> <lb/>
of Ormond, to be worthy of caution and fear. His <lb/>
means of information I did not pretend, and thought it <reg orig="use-|less">useless</reg> <lb/>
to investigate. We cannot hide our actions and thoughts, <lb/>
from one of powerful sagacity, whom the detection <reg orig="suffi-|ciently">sufficiently</reg> <lb/>
interests, to make him use all the methods of <reg orig="detec-|tion">detection</reg> <lb/>
in his power. The study of concealment is, in all <lb/>
cases, fruitless or hurtful. All that duty enjoins, is to design <lb/>
and to execute nothing, which may not be approved by a <lb/>
divine and omniscient observer. Human scrutiny is <reg orig="nei-|ther">neither</reg> <lb/>
to be solicited, nor shunned. Human approbation or <lb/>
censure, can never be exempt from injustice, because our <lb/>
limited perceptions debar us from a thorough knowledge of <lb/>
any actions and motives but our own.</p>
<p>On reviewing what had passed, between Constantia and <lb/>
me, I recollected nothing incompatible with purity and <reg orig="rec-|titude">rectitude</reg>. <lb/>
That Ormond was apprized of all that had passed, <lb/>
I by no means inferred from the tenor of his conversation <lb/>
with Constantia, nor, if this had been incontestably proved, <lb/>
should I have experienced any trepidation or anxiety on <lb/>
that account.</p>
<p>His obscure and indirect menaces of evil, were of more <lb/>
<pb n="230" entity="eaf033v5_0243" pid="uva-lib:350509"/>
importance. His discourse on this topic, seemed <reg orig="suscepti-|ble">susceptible</reg> <lb/>
only of two constructions. Either he intended some <lb/>
fatal mischief, and was willing to torment her by fears, while <lb/>
he concealed from her the nature of her danger, that he <lb/>
might hinder her from guarding her safety, by suitable <reg orig="pre-|cautions">precautions</reg>; <lb/>
or, being hopeless of rendering her propitious to <lb/>
his wishes, his malice was satisfied with leaving her a legacy <lb/>
of apprehension and doubt.</p>
<p>Constantia's unacquaintance with the doctrines of that <lb/>
school, in which Ormond was probably instructed, led her <lb/>
to regard the conduct of this man, with more curiosity and <lb/>
wonder, than fear. She saw nothing but a disposition to <lb/>
sport with her ignorance and bewilder her with doubts.</p>
<p>I do not believe myself destitute of courage. Rightly <lb/>
to estimate the danger and encounter it with firmness, are <lb/>
worthy of a rational being; but to place our security in <lb/>
thoughtlessness and blindness, is only less ignoble than <reg orig="cow-|ardice">cowardice</reg>. <lb/>
I could not forget the proofs of violence, which <lb/>
accompanied the death of Mr. Dudley. I could not <reg orig="over-|look">overlook</reg>, <lb/>
in the recent conversation with Constantia, Ormond's <lb/>
allusion to her murdered father. It was possible that the <lb/>
nature of this death had been accidentally imparted to him; <lb/>
but it was likewise possible, that his was the knowledge of <lb/>
one who performed the act.</p>
<p>The enormity of this deed, appeared by no means <reg orig="incon-|gruous">incongruous</reg> <lb/>
with the sentiments of Ormond. Human life is <reg orig="mo-|mentous">momentous</reg> <lb/>
or trivial in our eyes, according to the course which <lb/>
our habits and opinions have taken. Passion greedily <reg orig="ac-|cepts">accepts</reg>, <lb/>
and habit readily offers, the sacrifice of another's life, <lb/>
and reason obeys the impulse of education and desire.</p>
<p>A youth of eighteen, a volunteer in a Russian army, <reg orig="en-|camped">encamped</reg> <lb/>
in Bessarabia, made prey of a Tartar girl, found in <lb/>
the field of a recent battle. Conducting her to his quarters, <lb/>
he met a friend, who, on some pretence, claimed the victim. <lb/>
From angry words they betook themselves to swords. A <lb/>
combat ensued, in which the first claimant ran his antagonist <lb/>
through the body. He then bore his prize unmolested away, <lb/>
and having exercised brutality of one kind, upon the helpless <lb/>
victim, stabbed her to the heart, as an offering to the <hi rend="italic">manes</hi> <lb/>
of Sarsefield, the friend whom he had slain. Next morning, <lb/>
willing more signally to expiate his guilt, he rushed alone <lb/>
<pb n="231" entity="eaf033v5_0244" pid="uva-lib:350510"/>
upon a troop of Turkish foragers, and brought away five <lb/>
heads, suspended, by their gory locks, to his horse's mane. <lb/>
These he cast upon the grave of Sarsefield, and conceived <lb/>
himself fully to have expiated yesterday's offence. In reward <lb/>
for his prowess, the General gave him a commission in the <lb/>
Cossack troops. This youth was Ormond; and such is a <lb/>
specimen of his exploits, during a military career of eight <lb/>
years, in a warfare the most savage and implacable, and, at <lb/>
the same time, the most iniquitous and wanton which history <lb/>
records.</p>
<p>With passions and habits like these, the life of another was <lb/>
a trifling sacrifice to vengeance or impatience. How Mr. <lb/>
Dudley had excited the resentment of Ormond, by what <lb/>
means the assassin had accomplished his intention, without <lb/>
awekening alarm or incurring suspicion, it was not for me to <lb/>
discover. The inextricability of human events, the <reg orig="imper-|viousness">imperviousness</reg> <lb/>
of cunning, and the obduracy of malice, I had <lb/>
frequent occasions to remark.</p>
<p>I did not labor to vanquish the security of my friend. As <lb/>
to precautions they were useless. There was no fortress, <lb/>
guarded by barriers of stone and iron, and watched by <reg orig="sen-|tinels">sentinels</reg> <lb/>
that never slept, to which she might retire from his <reg orig="strat-|agems">stratagems</reg>. <lb/>
If there were such a retreat, it would scarcely avail <lb/>
her against a foe, circumspect and subtle as Ormond.</p>
<p>I pondered on the condition of my friend. I reviewed <lb/>
the incidents of her life. I compared her lot with that of <lb/>
others. I could not but discover a sort of incurable malignity <lb/>
in her fate. I felt as if it were denied to her to enjoy a long <lb/>
life or permanent tranquillity. I asked myself, what she had <lb/>
done, entitling her to this incessant persecution? Impatience <lb/>
and murmuring took place of sorrow and fear in my heart. <lb/>
When I reflected, that all human agency was merely <reg orig="sub-|servient">subservient</reg> <lb/>
to a divine purpose, I fell into fits of accusation and <lb/>
impiety.</p>
<p>This injustice was transient, and soberer views convinced <lb/>
me that every scheme, comprising the whole, must be <lb/>
productive of partial and temporary evil. The sufferings of <lb/>
Constantia were limited to a moment; they were the <reg orig="un-|avoidable">unavoidable</reg> <lb/>
appendages of terrestrial existence; they formed <lb/>
the only avenue to wisdom, and the only claim to <reg orig="uninterrupt-|ed">uninterrupted</reg> <lb/>
fruition, and eternal repose in an after scene.</p>
<pb n="232" entity="eaf033v5_0245" pid="uva-lib:350511"/>
<p>The course of my reflections, and the issue to which they <lb/>
led, were unforeseen by myself. Fondly as I doated upon <lb/>
this woman, methought I could resign her to the grave <lb/>
without a murmur or a tear. While my thoughts were <lb/>
calmed by resignation, and my fancy occupied with nothing <lb/>
but the briefness of that space, and evanescence of that <lb/>
time which severs the living from the dead, I contemplated, <lb/>
almost with complacency, a violent or untimely close to her <lb/>
existence.</p>
<p>This loftiness of mind could not always be accomplished <lb/>
or constantly maintained. One effect of my fears, was to <lb/>
hasten my departure to Europe. There existed no <reg orig="imped-|iment">impediment</reg> <lb/>
but the want of a suitable conveyance. In the first <lb/>
packet that should leave America, it was determined to <lb/>
secure a passage. Mr. Melbourne consented to take charge <lb/>
of Constantia's property, and, after the sale of it, to transmit <lb/>
to her the money that should thence arise.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I was anxious that Constantia should leave <lb/>
her present abode and join me in New York. She willingly <lb/>
adopted this arrangement, but conceived it necessary to <lb/>
spend a few days at her house in Jersey. She could reach <lb/>
the latter place without much deviation from the straight <lb/>
road, and she was desirous of resurveying a spot where <lb/>
many of her infantile days had been spent.</p>
<p>This house and domain I have already mentioned to have <lb/>
once belonged to Mr. Dudley. It was selected with the <lb/>
judgment and adorned with the taste of a disciple of the <lb/>
schools of Florence and Vincenza. In his view, cultivation <lb/>
was subservient to the picturesque, and a mansion was <reg orig="erect-|ed">erected</reg>, <lb/>
eminent for nothing but chastity of ornaments, and <lb/>
simplicity of structure. The massive parts were of stone; <lb/>
the outer surfaces were smooth, snow white, and diversified <lb/>
by apertures and cornices, in which a cement uncommonly <lb/>
tenacious was wrought into proportions the most correct, and <lb/>
forms the most graceful. The floors, walls and ceilings, <lb/>
consisted of a still more exquisitely tempered substance, <lb/>
and were painted by Mr. Dudley's own hand. All <reg orig="appen-|dages">appendages</reg> <lb/>
of this building, as seats, tables and cabinets, were <lb/>
modelled by the owner's particular direction, and in a <reg orig="man-|ner">manner</reg> <lb/>
scrupulously classical.</p>
<pb n="233" entity="eaf033v5_0246" pid="uva-lib:350512"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">20*</fw></pb>
<p>He had scarcely entered on the enjoyment of this <reg orig="splen-|did">splendid</reg> <lb/>
possession, when it was ravished away. No privation <lb/>
was endured with more impatience than this; but, happily, <lb/>
it was purchased by one who left Mr. Dudley's <reg orig="arrange-|ments">arrangements</reg> <lb/>
unmolested, and who shortly after conveyed it entire <lb/>
to Ormond. By him it was finally appropriated to the use <lb/>
of Helena Cleves, and now, by a singular contexture of <lb/>
events, it had reverted to those hands, in which the death of <lb/>
the original proprietor, if no other change had been made in <lb/>
his condition, would have left it. The farm still remained <lb/>
in the tenure of a German emigrant, who held it partly on <lb/>
condition of preserving the garden and mansion in safety and <lb/>
in perfect order.</p>
<p>This retreat was now revisited by Constantia, after an <lb/>
interval of four years. Autumn had made some progress, <lb/>
but the aspect of nature was, so to speak, more significant <lb/>
than at any other season. She was agreeably <reg orig="accommo-|dated">accommodated</reg> <lb/>
under the tenant's roof, and found a nameless pleasure <lb/>
in traversing spaces, in which every object prompted an <lb/>
endless train of recollections.</p>
<p>Her sensations were not foreseen. They led to a state <lb/>
of mind, inconsistent, in some degree, with the projects <lb/>
adopted in obedience to the suggestions of a friend. Every <lb/>
thing in this scene had been created and modelled by the <lb/>
genius of her father. It was a kind of fane, sanctified by his <lb/>
imaginary presence.</p>
<p>To consign the fruits of his industry and invention to <lb/>
foreign and unsparing hands, seemed a kind of sacrilege, for <lb/>
which she almost feared that the dead would rise to upbraid <lb/>
her. Those images which bind us to our natal soil, to the <lb/>
abode of our innocent and careless youth, were recalled to <lb/>
her fancy by the scenes which she now beheld. These <lb/>
were enforced by considerations of the dangers which <reg orig="at-|tended">attended</reg> <lb/>
her voyage, from storms and from enemies, and <lb/>
from the tendency to revolution and war, which seemed to <lb/>
actuate all the nations of Europe. Her native country was <lb/>
by no means exempt from similar tendencies, but these <lb/>
evils were less imminent, and its manners and government, <lb/>
in their present modifications, were unspeakably more <reg orig="favora-|ble">favorable</reg> <lb/>
to the dignity and improvement of the human race, than <lb/>
those which prevailed in any part of the ancient world.</p>
<pb n="234" entity="eaf033v5_0247" pid="uva-lib:350513"/>
<p>My solicitations and my obligation to repair to England, <lb/>
overweighed her objections, but her new reflections led her <lb/>
to form new determinations with regard to this part of her <lb/>
property. She concluded to retain possession, and hoped <lb/>
that some future event would allow her to return to this <lb/>
favorite spot, without forfeiture of my society. An abode <lb/>
of some years in Europe would more eminently qualify her <lb/>
for the enjoyment of retirement and safety in her native <lb/>
country. The time that should elapse before her <reg orig="embarka-|tion">embarkation</reg>, <lb/>
she was desirous of passing among the shades of this <lb/>
romantic retreat.</p>
<p>I was, by no means, reconciled to this proceeding. I <lb/>
loved my friend too well to endure any needless separation <lb/>
without repining. In addition to this, the image of Ormond <lb/>
haunted my thoughts, and gave birth to incessant but <reg orig="inde-|finable">indefinable</reg> <lb/>
fears. I believed that her safety would very little <lb/>
depend upon the nature of her abode, or the number or <lb/>
watchfulness of her companions. My nearness to her <reg orig="per-|son">person</reg> <lb/>
would frustrate no stratagem, nor promote any other end <lb/>
than my own entanglement in the same fold. Still, that I <lb/>
was not apprized, each hour, of her condition, that her state <lb/>
was lonely and sequestered, were sources of disquiet, the <lb/>
obvious remedy to which was her coming to New York. <lb/>
Preparations for departure were assigned to me, and these <lb/>
required my continuance in the city.</p>
<p>Once a week, Laffert, her tenant, visited, for purposes of <lb/>
traffic, the city. He was the medium of our correspondence. <lb/>
To him I entrusted a letter, in which my dissatisfaction at <lb/>
her absence, and the causes which gave it birth, were freely <lb/>
confessed.</p>
<p>The confidence of safety seldom deserted my friend. <lb/>
Since her mysterious conversation with Ormond, he had <lb/>
utterly vanished. Previously to that interview, his visits or <lb/>
his letters were incessant and punctual; but since, no token <lb/>
was given that he existed. Two months had elapsed. He <lb/>
gave her no reason to expect a cessation of intercourse. He <lb/>
had parted from her with his usual abruptness and informality. <lb/>
She did not conceive it incumbent on her to search him out, <lb/>
but she would not have been displeased with an opportunity <lb/>
to discuss with him more fully the motives of her conduct. <lb/>
This opportunity had been hitherto denied.</p>
<pb n="235" entity="eaf033v5_0248" pid="uva-lib:350514"/>
<p>Her occupations, in her present retreat, were, for the <lb/>
most part, dictated by caprice or by chance. The mildness <lb/>
of autumn permitted her to ramble, during the day, from <lb/>
one rock and one grove to another. There was a luxury <lb/>
in musing, and in the sensations which the scenery and <lb/>
silence produced, which, in consequence of her long <reg orig="es-|trangement">estrangement</reg> <lb/>
from them, were accompanied with all the <reg orig="at-|tractions">attractions</reg> <lb/>
of novelty, and from which she would not consent <lb/>
to withdraw.</p>
<p>In the evening she usually retired to the mansion, and <lb/>
shut herself up in that apartment, which, in the original <lb/>
structure of the house, had been designed for study, and no <lb/>
part of whose furniture had been removed or displaced. It <lb/>
was a kind of closet on the second floor, illuminated by a <lb/>
spacious window, through which a landscape of uncommon <lb/>
amplitude and beauty was presented to the view. Here <lb/>
the pleasures of the day were revived, by recalling and <lb/>
enumerating them in letters to her friend. She always <lb/>
quitted this recess with reluctance, and, seldom, till the night <lb/>
was half spent.</p>
<p>One evening she retired hither when the sun had just <lb/>
dipped beneath the horizon. Her implements of writing <lb/>
were prepared, but before the pen was assumed, her eyes <lb/>
rested for a moment on the variegated hues, which were <lb/>
poured out upon the western sky, and upon the scene of <lb/>
intermingled waters, copses and fields. The view <reg orig="com-|prised">comprised</reg> <lb/>
a part of the road which led to this dwelling. It was <lb/>
partially and distantly seen, and the passage of horses or <lb/>
men, was betokened chiefly by the dust which was raised <lb/>
by their footsteps.</p>
<p>A token of this kind now caught her attention. It fixed <lb/>
her eye, chiefly by the picturesque effect produced by <reg orig="in-|terposing">interposing</reg> <lb/>
its obscurity between her and the splendors which <lb/>
the sun had left. Presently she gained a faint view of a <lb/>
man and horse. This circumstance laid no claim to <reg orig="atten-|tion">attention</reg>, <lb/>
and she was withdrawing her eye, when the traveller's <lb/>
stopping and dismounting at the gate, made her renew her <lb/>
scrutiny. This was reinforced by something in the figure <lb/>
and movements of the horseman, which reminded her of <lb/>
Ormond.</p>
<p>She started from her seat with some degree of <reg orig="palpita-|tion">palpitation</reg>. <lb/>
<pb n="236" entity="eaf033v5_0249" pid="uva-lib:350515"/>
Whence this arose, whether from fear or from joy, or <lb/>
from intermixed emotions, it would not be easy to ascertain. <lb/>
Having entered the gate, the visitant, remounting his horse, <lb/>
set the animal on full speed. Every moment brought him <lb/>
nearer, and added to her first belief. He stopped not till <lb/>
he reached the mansion. The person of Ormond was <reg orig="dis-|tinctly">distinctly</reg> <lb/>
recognised.</p>
<p>An interview, at this dusky and lonely hour, in <reg orig="circum-|stances">circumstances</reg> <lb/>
so abrupt and unexpected, could not fail to surprise, <lb/>
and, in some degree, to alarm. The substance of his last <lb/>
conversation was recalled. The evils which were darkly <lb/>
and ambiguously predicted, thronged to her memory. It <lb/>
seemed as if the present moment was to be, in some way, <lb/>
decisive of her fate. This visit, she did not hesitate to <reg orig="sup-|pose">suppose</reg>, <lb/>
designed for her, but somewhat uncommonly <reg orig="momen-|tous">momentous</reg>, <lb/>
must have prompted him to take so long a journey.</p>
<p>The rooms on the lower floor were dark, the windows <lb/>
and doors being fastened. She had entered the house by <lb/>
the principal door, and this was the only one, at present, <lb/>
unlocked. The room in which she sat, was over the hall, <lb/>
and the massive door beneath could not be opened, without <lb/>
noisy signals. The question that occurred to her, by what <lb/>
means Ormond would gain admittance to her presence, she <lb/>
supposed would be instantly decided. She listened to hear <lb/>
his footsteps on the pavement, or the creaking of hinges. <lb/>
The silence, however, continued profound as before.</p>
<p>After a minute's pause, she approached the window more <lb/>
nearly, and endeavored to gain a view of the space before <lb/>
the house. She saw nothing but the horse, whose bridle <lb/>
was thrown over his neck, and who was left at liberty to <lb/>
pick up what scanty herbage the lawn afforded to his hunger. <lb/>
The rider had disappeared.</p>
<p>It now occurred to her, that this visit had a purpose <reg orig="dif-|ferent">different</reg> <lb/>
from that which she at first conjectured. It was <lb/>
easily conceived, that Ormond was unacquainted with her <lb/>
residence at this spot. The knowledge could only be <reg orig="im-|parted">imparted</reg> <lb/>
to him, by indirect or illicit means. That these <lb/>
means had been employed by him, she was by no means <lb/>
authorized to infer from the silence and distance he had <lb/>
lately maintained. But if an interview with her, were not <lb/>
the purpose of his coming, how should she interpret it?</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXVIII.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">While</hi> occupied with these reflections, the light hastily <lb/>
disappeared, and darkness, rendered, by a cloudy <reg orig="atmo-|sphere">atmosphere</reg>, <lb/>
uncommonly intense, succeeded. She had the <lb/>
means of lighting a lamp, that hung against the wall, but had <lb/>
been too much immersed in thought, to notice the <reg orig="deepen-|ing">deepening</reg> <lb/>
of the gloom. Recovering from her reverie, she looked <lb/>
around her with some degree of trepidation, and prepared to <lb/>
strike a spark, that would enable her to light her lamp.</p>
<p>She had hitherto indulged an habitual indifference to <reg orig="dan-|ger">danger</reg>. <lb/>
Now the presence of Ormond, the unknown purpose <lb/>
that led him hither, and the defencelessness of her condition, <lb/>
inspired her with apprehensions, to which she had hitherto <lb/>
been a stranger. She had been accustomed to pass many <lb/>
nocturnal hours in this closet. Till now, nothing had <reg orig="occur-|red">occurred</reg>, <lb/>
that made her enter it with circumspection, or continue <lb/>
in it with reluctance.</p>
<p>Her sensations were no longer tranquil. Each minute <lb/>
that she spent in this recess, appeared to multiply her <reg orig="ha-|zards">hazards</reg>. <lb/>
To linger here, appeared to her the height of <lb/>
culpable temerity. She hastily resolved to return to the <lb/>
farmer's dwelling, and, on the morrow, to repair to New <lb/>
York. For this end, she was desirous to produce a light. <lb/>
The materials were at hand.</p>
<p>She lifted her hand to strike the flint, when her ear caught <lb/>
a sound, which betokened the opening of the door, that led <lb/>
into the next apartment. Her motion was suspended, and <lb/>
she listened as well as a throbbing heart would permit. That <lb/>
Ormond's was the hand that opened, was the first <reg orig="sugges-|tion">suggestion</reg> <lb/>
of her fears. The motives of this unseasonable entrance, <lb/>
could not be reconciled with her safety. He had given no <lb/>
warning of his approach, and the door was opened with <reg orig="tar-|diness">tardiness</reg> <lb/>
and seeming caution.</p>
<p>Sounds continued, of which no distinct conception could <lb/>
be obtained, or the cause that produced them assigned. The <lb/>
floors of every apartment being composed, like the walls and <lb/>
ceiling, of cement, footsteps were rendered almost <reg orig="undistin-|guishable">undistinguishable</reg>. <lb/>
It was plain, however, that some one approached <lb/>
her own door.</p>
<pb n="238" entity="eaf033v5_0251" pid="uva-lib:350517"/>
<p>The panic and confusion that now invaded her, was owing <lb/>
to surprise, and to the singularity of her situation. The <lb/>
mansion was desolate and lonely. It was night. She was <lb/>
immersed in darkness. She had not the means, and was <lb/>
unaccustomed to the office of repelling personal injuries. <lb/>
What injuries she had reason to dread, who was the agent, <lb/>
and what were his motives, were subjects of vague and <reg orig="inco-|herent">incoherent</reg> <lb/>
meditation.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, low and imperfect sounds, that had in them <lb/>
more of inanimate than human, assailed her ear. Presently <lb/>
they ceased. An inexplicable fear deterred her from calling. <lb/>
Light would have exercised a friendly influence. This, it <lb/>
was in her power to produce, but not without motion and <lb/>
noise, and these, by occasioning the discovery of her being <lb/>
in the closet, might possibly enhance her danger.</p>
<p>Conceptions like these, were unworthy of the mind of <reg orig="Con-|stantia">Constantia</reg>. <lb/>
An interval of silence succeeded, interrupted only <lb/>
by the whistling of the blast without. It was sufficient for <lb/>
the restoration of her courage. She blushed at the <reg orig="coward-|ice">cowardice</reg> <lb/>
which had trembled at a sound. She considered that <lb/>
Ormond might, indeed, be near, but that he was probably <lb/>
unconscious of her situation. His coming was not with the <lb/>
circumspection of an enemy. He might be acquainted with <lb/>
the place of her retreat, and had come to obtain an interview, <lb/>
with no clandestine or mysterious purposes. The noises she <lb/>
had heard, had, doubtless, proceeded from the next <reg orig="apart-|ment">apartment</reg>, <lb/>
but might be produced by some harmless or vagrant <lb/>
creature.</p>
<p>These considerations restored her tranquillity. They <reg orig="en-|abled">enabled</reg> <lb/>
her, deliberately, to create a light, but they did not <lb/>
dissuade her from leaving the house. Omens of evil <reg orig="seem-|ed">seemed</reg> <lb/>
to be connected with this solitary and darksome abode. <lb/>
Besides, Ormond had unquestionably entered upon this <lb/>
scene. It could not be doubted that she was the object of <lb/>
his visit. The farm house was a place of meeting, more <lb/>
suitable and safe than any other. Thither, therefore, she <lb/>
determined immediately to return.</p>
<p>The closet had but one door, and this led into the <reg orig="cham-|ber">chamber</reg> <lb/>
where the sounds had arisen. Through this chamber, <lb/>
therefore, she was obliged to pass, in order to reach the <lb/>
staircase, which terminated in the hall below.</p>
<pb n="239" entity="eaf033v5_0252" pid="uva-lib:350518"/>
<p>Bearing the light in her left hand, she withdrew the bolt <lb/>
of the door, and opened. In spite of courageous efforts, she <lb/>
opened with unwillingness, and shuddered to throw a glance <lb/>
forward or advance a step into the room. This was not <lb/>
needed, to reveal to her the cause of her late disturbance. <lb/>
Her eye instantly lighted on the body of a man, supine, <reg orig="mo-|tionless">motionless</reg>, <lb/>
stretched on the floor, close to the door through <lb/>
which she was about to pass.</p>
<p>A spectacle like this, was qualified to startle her. She <lb/>
shrunk back and fixed a more steadfast eye, upon the <reg orig="pros-|trate">prostrate</reg> <lb/>
person. There was no mark of blood or of wounds, <lb/>
but there was something in the attitude, more significant of <lb/>
death than of sleep. His face rested on the floor, and his <lb/>
ragged locks concealed what part of his visage was not <reg orig="hid-|den">hidden</reg> <lb/>
by his posture. His garb was characterized by <reg orig="fash-|ionable">fashionable</reg> <lb/>
elegance, but was polluted with dust.</p>
<p>The image that first occurred to her, was that of Ormond. <lb/>
This instantly gave place to another, which was familiar to <lb/>
her apprehension. It was at first too indistinctly seen to <reg orig="sug-|gest">suggest</reg> <lb/>
a name. She continued to gaze and to be lost in <reg orig="fear-|ful">fearful</reg> <lb/>
astonishment. Was this the persen whose entrance had <lb/>
been overheard, and who had dragged himself hither to die <lb/>
at her door? Yet, in that case, would not groans and <reg orig="ex-|piring">expiring</reg> <lb/>
efforts have testified his condition, and invoked her <lb/>
succor? Was he not brought hither in the arms of his <reg orig="assas-|sin">assassin</reg>? <lb/>
She mused upon the possible motives that induced <lb/>
some one thus to act, and upon the connexion that might <lb/>
subsist, between her destiny and that of the dead.</p>
<p>Her meditations, however fruitless, in other respects, could <lb/>
not fail to show her the propriety of hastening from this spot. <lb/>
To scrutinize the form or face of the dead, was a task, to <lb/>
which her courage was unequal. Suitably accompanied and <lb/>
guarded, she would not scruple to return and ascertain, by <lb/>
the most sedulous examination, the causes of this ominous <lb/>
event.</p>
<p>She stept over the breathless corpse, and hurried to the <lb/>
staircase. It became her to maintain the command of her <lb/>
muscles and joints, and to proceed without faltering or <reg orig="hesi-|tation">hesitation</reg>. <lb/>
Scarcely had she reached the entrance of the hall, <lb/>
when, casting anxious looks forward, she beheld a human <lb/>
<pb n="240" entity="eaf033v5_0253" pid="uva-lib:350519"/>
figure. No scrutiny was requisite to inform her, that this <lb/>
was Ormond.</p>
<p>She stopped. He approached her with looks and <reg orig="ges-|tures">gestures</reg>, <lb/>
placid but solemn. There was nothing in his <reg orig="coun-|tenance">countenance</reg> <lb/>
rugged or malignant. On the contrary, there were <lb/>
tokens of compassion.</p>
<p>So, said he, I expected to meet you. A light, gleaming <lb/>
from the window, marked you out. This, and Laffert's <reg orig="di-|rections">directions</reg>, <lb/>
have guided me.</p>
<p>What said Constantia, with discomposure in her accent, <lb/>
was your motive for seeking me?</p>
<p>Have you forgotten, said Ormond, what passed at our <lb/>
last interview? The evil that I then predicted is at hand. <lb/>
Perhaps, you were incredulous; you accounted me a <reg orig="mad-|man">madman</reg> <lb/>
or deciever; now I am come to witness the fulfilment <lb/>
of my words, and the completion of your destiny. To rescue <lb/>
you, I have not come; that is not within the compass of <lb/>
human powers.</p>
<p>Poor Constantia! he continued, in tones that manifested <lb/>
genuine sympathy, look upon thyself as lost. The toils that <lb/>
beset thee are inextricable. Summon up thy patience to <lb/>
endure the evil. Now will the last and heaviest trial betide <lb/>
thy fortitude. I could weep for thee, if my manly nature <lb/>
would permit. This is the scene of thy calamity, and this <lb/>
the hour.</p>
<p>These words were adapted to excite curiosity mingled <lb/>
with terror. Ormond's deportment was of an unexampled <lb/>
tenor, as well as that evil which he had so ambiguously <reg orig="pre-|dicted">predicted</reg>. <lb/>
He offered no protection from danger, and yet gave <lb/>
no proof of being himself an agent or auxiliary. After a <lb/>
minute's pause, Constantia recovering a firm tone, said:</p>
<p>Mr. Ormond! Your recent deportment but ill accords <lb/>
with your professions of sincerity and plain dealing. What <lb/>
your purpose is, or whether you have any purpose, I am at <lb/>
a loss to conjecture. Whether you most deserve censure <lb/>
or ridicule, is a point which you afford me not the means of <lb/>
deciding, and to which, unless on your own account, I am <lb/>
indifferent. If you are willing to be more explicit, or if <lb/>
there be any topic on which you wish further to converse, <lb/>
I will not refuse your company to Laffert's dwelling. <reg orig="Long-|er">Longer</reg> <lb/>
to remain here, would be indiscreet and absurd.</p>
<pb n="241" entity="eaf033v5_0254" pid="uva-lib:350520"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">21</fw></pb>
<p>So saying she motioned towards the door. Ormond was <lb/>
passive, and seemed indisposed to prevent her departure, <lb/>
till she laid her hand upon the lock. He then, without <reg orig="mov-|ing">moving</reg> <lb/>
from his place, exclaimed.</p>
<p>Stay. Must this meeting, which fate ordains to be the last, <lb/>
be so short? Must a time and place so suitable, for what <lb/>
remains to be said and done, be neglected or misused? No. <lb/>
You charge me with duplicity, and deem my conduct either <lb/>
ridiculous or criminal. I have stated my reasons for <reg orig="con-|cealment">concealment</reg>, <lb/>
but these have failed to convince you. Well. <lb/>
Here is now an end to doubt. All ambiguities are <reg orig="prepar-|ing">preparing</reg> <lb/>
to vanish.</p>
<p>When Ormond began to speak, Constantia paused to <lb/>
hearken to him. His vehemence was not of that nature, <lb/>
which threatened to obstruct her passage. It was by <reg orig="en-|treaty">entreaty</reg> <lb/>
that he apparently endeavored to detain her steps, and <lb/>
not by violence. Hence arose her patience to listen. He <lb/>
continued.</p>
<p>Constantia! thy father is dead. Art thou not desirous of <lb/>
detecting the author of his fate? Will it afford thee no <reg orig="con-|solation">consolation</reg> <lb/>
to know that the deed is punished? Wilt thou <reg orig="suf-|fer">suffer</reg> <lb/>
me to drag the murderer to thy feet? Thy justice will <lb/>
be gratified by this sacrifice. Somewhat will be due to him <lb/>
who avenged thy wrong in the blood of the perpetrator? <lb/>
What sayest thou? Grant me thy permission, and, in a <lb/>
moment, I will drag him hither.</p>
<p>These words called up the image of the person, whose <lb/>
corpse she had lately seen. It was readily conceived that to <lb/>
him Ormond alluded, but this was the assassin of her father, <lb/>
and his crime had been detected and punished by Ormond! <lb/>
These images had no other effect than to urge her <reg orig="depar-|ture">departure</reg>; <lb/>
she again applied her hand to the lock, and said;</p>
<p>This scene must not be prolonged. My father's death I <lb/>
desire not to hear explained or to see revenged, but <reg orig="what-|ever">whatever</reg> <lb/>
information you are willing or able to communicate, <lb/>
must be deferred.</p>
<p>Nay, interrupted Ormond, with augmented vehemence, <lb/>
art thou equally devoid of curiosity and justice? Thinkest <lb/>
thou, that the enmity which bereft thy father of life, will not <lb/>
seek thy own? There are evils which I cannot prevent <lb/>
<pb n="242" entity="eaf033v5_0255" pid="uva-lib:350521"/>
thee from enduring, but there are, likewise, ills which my <lb/>
counsel will enable thee and thy friend to shun. Save me <lb/>
from witnessing thy death. Thy father's destiny is sealed; <lb/>
all that remained was to punish his assassin; but thou and <lb/>
thy Sophia still live. Why should ye perish by a like stroke?</p>
<p>This intimation was sufficient to arrest the steps of <reg orig="Con-|stantia">Constantia</reg>. <lb/>
She withdrew her hand from the door, and fixed <lb/>
eyes of the deepest anxiety on Ormond;&mdash;What mean you? <lb/>
How am I to understand&mdash;</p>
<p>Ah! said Ormond, I see thou wilt consent to stay. Thy <lb/>
detention shall not be long. Remain where thou art during <lb/>
one moment; merely while I drag hither thy enemy, and <lb/>
shew thee a visage which thou wilt not be slow to recognise. <lb/>
Saying this, he hastily ascended the staircase, and quickly <lb/>
passed beyond her sight.</p>
<p>Deportment thus mysterious, could not fail of bewildering <lb/>
her thoughts. There was somewhat in the looks and <reg orig="ac-|cents">accents</reg> <lb/>
of Ormond, different from former appearances; tokens <lb/>
of a hidden purpose and a smothered meaning, were <reg orig="per-|ceptible">perceptible</reg>; <lb/>
a mixture of the inoffensive and the lawless, which <lb/>
added to the loneliness and silence that encompassed her, <lb/>
produced a faltering emotion. Her curiosity was <reg orig="overpow-|ered">overpowered</reg> <lb/>
by her fear, and the resolution was suddenly conceived, <lb/>
of seizing this opportunity to escape.</p>
<p>A third time she put her hand to the lock and attempted to <lb/>
open. The effort was ineffectual. The door that was <reg orig="ac-|customed">accustomed</reg> <lb/>
to obey the gentlest touch, was now immoveable. <lb/>
She had lately unlocked and passed through it. Her eager <lb/>
inspection convinced her that the principal bolt was still <reg orig="with-|drawn">withdrawn</reg>, <lb/>
but a smaller one was now perceived, of whose <reg orig="ex-|istence">existence</reg> <lb/>
she had not been apprized, and over which her key <lb/>
had no power.</p>
<p>Now did she first harbor a fear that was intelligible in its <lb/>
dictates. Now did she first perceive herself sinking in the <lb/>
toils of some lurking enemy. Hope whispered that this foe <lb/>
was not Ormond. His conduct had bespoken no <reg orig="willing-|ness">willingness</reg> <lb/>
to put constraint upon her steps. He talked not as if <lb/>
he was aware of this obstruction, and yet his seeming <reg orig="ac-|quiescence">acquiescence</reg> <lb/>
might have flowed from a knowledge that she <lb/>
had no power to remove beyond his reach.</p>
<pb n="243" entity="eaf033v5_0256" pid="uva-lib:350522"/>
<p>He warned her of danger to her life, of which he was her <lb/>
self-appointed rescuer. His counsel was to arm her with <lb/>
sufficient caution; the peril that awaited her was imminent; <lb/>
this was the time and place of its occurrence, and here she <lb/>
was compelled to remain, till the power that fastened, would <lb/>
condescend to loose the door. There were other avenues <lb/>
to the hall. These were accustomed to be locked, but <reg orig="Or-|mond">Ormond</reg> <lb/>
had found access, and if all continued fast, it was <reg orig="in-|contestable">incontestable</reg> <lb/>
that he was the author of this new impediment.</p>
<p>The other avenues were hastily examined. All were <lb/>
holted and locked. The first impulse led her to call for <lb/>
help from without, but the mansion was distant from Laffert's <lb/>
habitation. This spot was wholly unfrequented. No <reg orig="pas-|senger">passenger</reg> <lb/>
was likely to be stationed where her call could be <lb/>
heard. Besides, this forcible detention might operate for a <lb/>
short time, and be attended with no mischievous <reg orig="conse-|quences">consequences</reg>. <lb/>
Whatever was to come, it was her duty to collect <lb/>
her courage and encounter it.</p>
<p>The steps of Ormond above now gave tokens of his <reg orig="ap-|proach">approach</reg>. <lb/>
Vigilant observance of this man was all that her <lb/>
situation permitted. A vehement effort restored her to some <lb/>
degree of composure. Her stifled palpitations allowed her <lb/>
steadfastly to notice him, as he now descended the stairs, <lb/>
bearing a lifeless body in his arms. There, said he, as he <lb/>
cast it at her feet, whose countenance is that? Who would <lb/>
imagine that features like those, belonged to an assassin and <lb/>
imposter?</p>
<p>Closed eyelids and fallen muscles, could not hide from <lb/>
her lineaments so often seen. She shrunk back and <reg orig="exclaim-|ed&mdash;Thomas">exclaimed&mdash;Thomas</reg> <lb/>
Craig!</p>
<p>A pause succeeded, in which she alternately gazed at the <lb/>
countenance of this unfortunate wretch and at Ormond. At <lb/>
length, the latter exclaimed.</p>
<p>Well, my girl; hast thou examined him? Dost thou <reg orig="re-|cognise">recognise</reg> <lb/>
a friend or an enemy?</p>
<p>I know him well; but how came this? What purpose <lb/>
brought him hither? Who was the author of his fate?</p>
<p>Have I not already told thee that Ormond was his own <lb/>
avenger and thine? To thee and to me he has been a <reg orig="rob-|ber">robber</reg>. <lb/>
To him thy father is indebted for the loss not only of <lb/>
property but life. Did crimes like these merit a less <reg orig="pun-|ishment">punishment</reg>? <lb/>
<pb n="244" entity="eaf033v5_0257" pid="uva-lib:350523"/>
And what recompense is due to him whose <reg orig="vigi-|lance">vigilance</reg> <lb/>
pursued him hither, and made him pay for his offences <lb/>
with his blood? What benefit have I received at thy hand <lb/>
to authorize me, for thy sake, to take away his life?</p>
<p>No benefit received from me, said Constantia, would <reg orig="jus-|tify">justify</reg> <lb/>
such an act. I should have abhorred myself for <reg orig="annex-|ing">annexing</reg> <lb/>
to my benefits, so bloody a condition. It calls for no <lb/>
gratitude for recompense. Its suitable attendant is remorse. <lb/>
That he is a thief, I know but too well; that my father died <lb/>
by his hand is incredible.&mdash;No motives or means&mdash;</p>
<p>Why so? interrupted Ormond. Does not sleep seal up <lb/>
the senses? Cannot closets be unlocked at midnight? <reg orig="Can-|not">Cannot</reg> <lb/>
adjoining houses communicate by doors? Cannot these <lb/>
doors be hidden from suspicion by a sheet of canvass?</p>
<p>These words were of startling and abundant import. They <lb/>
reminded her of circumstances in her father's chamber, <lb/>
which sufficiently explained the means by which his life was <lb/>
assailed. The closet, and its canvass-covered wall; the <reg orig="ad-|joining">adjoining</reg> <lb/>
house untenanted and shut up&mdash;but this house, though <lb/>
unoccupied, belonged to Ormond! From the inferences <lb/>
which flowed hence, her attention was withdrawn by her <lb/>
companion, who continued.</p>
<p>Do these means imply the interposal of a miracle? His <lb/>
motives? What scruples can be expected from a man <reg orig="in-|ured">inured</reg>, <lb/>
from infancy, to cunning and pillage? Will he abstain <lb/>
from murder when urged by excruciating poverty, by <reg orig="men-|aces">menaces</reg> <lb/>
of persecution; by terror of expiring on the gallows?</p>
<p>Tumultuous suspicions were now awakened in the mind <lb/>
of Constantia. Her faltering voice scarcely allowed her to <lb/>
ask; how know <hi rend="italic">you</hi> that Craig was thus guilty; that these <lb/>
were his incitements and means?&mdash;</p>
<p>Ormond's solemnity now gave place to a tone of sarcasm <lb/>
and looks of exultation. Poor Constantia! Thou art still <lb/>
pestered with incredulity and doubts! My veracity is still in <lb/>
question! My knowledge, girl, is infallible. That these were <lb/>
his means of access I cannot be ignorant, for I pointed them <lb/>
out. He was urged by these motives, for they were stated <lb/>
and entorced by me. His was the deed, for I stood beside <lb/>
him when it was done.</p>
<p>These indeed, were terms that stood in no need of further <lb/>
explanation. The veil that shrouded this formidable being, <lb/>
<pb n="245" entity="eaf033v5_0258" pid="uva-lib:350524"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">21*</fw></pb>
was lifted high enough to make him be regarded with <reg orig="inex-|plicable">inexplicable</reg> <lb/>
horror. What his future acts should be, how his <lb/>
omens of ill were to be solved, were still involved in <reg orig="uncer-|tainty">uncertainty</reg>.</p>
<p>In the midst of fears for her own safety, by which <reg orig="Con-|stantia">Constantia</reg> <lb/>
was now assailed, the image of her father was revived; <lb/>
keen regret and vehement upbraiding were conjured up.</p>
<p>Craig then was the instrument, and your's the instigation <lb/>
that destroyed my father! In what had he offended you? <lb/>
What cause had he given for resentment?</p>
<p>Cause! replied he, with impetuous accents, Resentment! <lb/>
None. My motive was benevolent; my deed conferred a <lb/>
benefit. I gave him sight and took away his life, from <reg orig="mo-|tives">motives</reg> <lb/>
equally wise. Know you not that Ormond was fool <lb/>
enough to set value on the affections of a woman? These <lb/>
were sought with preposterous anxiety and endless labor. <lb/>
Among other facilitators of his purpose, he summoned <reg orig="grati-|tude">gratitude</reg> <lb/>
to his aid. To snatch you from poverty, to restore his <lb/>
sight to your father, were expected to operate as incentives <lb/>
to love.</p>
<p>But here I was the dupe of error. A thousand prejudices <lb/>
stood in my way. These, provided our intercourse were <lb/>
not obstructed, I hoped to subdue. The rage of innovation <lb/>
seized your father; this, blended with a mortal antipathy <lb/>
to me, made him labor to seduce you from the bosom of <lb/>
your peaceful country; to make you enter on a boisterous <lb/>
sea; to visit lands where all is havoc and hostility. To <lb/>
snatch you from the influence of my arguments.</p>
<p>This new obstacle I was bound to remove. While <reg orig="revolv-|ing">revolving</reg> <lb/>
the means, chance and his evil destiny, threw Craig in my <lb/>
way. I soon convinced him that his reputation and his life <lb/>
were in my hands. His retention of these depended upon <lb/>
my will, on the performance of conditions which I prescribed.</p>
<p>My happiness and your's, depended on your concurrence <lb/>
with my wishes. Your father's life was an obstacle to your <lb/>
concurrence. For killing him, therefore, I may claim your <lb/>
gratitude. His death was a due and disinterested offering, <lb/>
at the altar of your felicity and mine.</p>
<p>My deed was not injurious to him. At his age, death, <lb/>
whose coming, at some period, is inevitable, could not be <lb/>
distant. To make it unforeseen and brief, and void of pain; <lb/>
<pb n="246" entity="eaf033v5_0259" pid="uva-lib:350525"/>
to preclude the torments of a lingering malady; a slow and <lb/>
visible descent to the grave; was the dictates of beneficence. <lb/>
But of what value was a continuance of his life? Either <lb/>
you would have gone with him to Europe, or have staid at <lb/>
home with me. In the first case, his life would have been <lb/>
rapidly consumed by perils and cares. In the second, <reg orig="sepa-|ration">separation</reg> <lb/>
from you, and union with me, a being so detestable, <lb/>
would equally have poisoned his existence.</p>
<p>Craig's cowardice and crimes, made him a pliant and <reg orig="com-|modious">commodious</reg> <lb/>
tool. I pointed out the way. The unsuspected <lb/>
door, which led into the closet of your father's chamber, <lb/>
was made by my direction, during the life of Helena. By <lb/>
this avenue I was wont to post myself, where all your <reg orig="con-|versations">conversations</reg> <lb/>
could be overheard. By this avenue, an entrance <lb/>
and retreat were afforded to the agent of my newest <reg orig="pur-|pose">purpose</reg>.</p>
<p>Fool that I was! I solaced myself with the belief that all <lb/>
impediments were now smoothed, when a new enemy <reg orig="ap-|peared">appeared</reg>; <lb/>
my folly lasted as long as my hope. I saw that to <lb/>
gain your affections, fortified by antiquated scruples, and <reg orig="ob-|sequious">obsequious</reg> <lb/>
to the guidance of this new monitor, was impossible. <lb/>
It is not my way to toil after that which is beyond my reach. <lb/>
If the greater good be inaccessible, I learn to be contented <lb/>
with the less.</p>
<p>I have served you with successless sedulity. I have set <lb/>
an engine in act to obliterate an obstacle to your felicity, and <lb/>
lay your father at rest. Under my guidance, this engine <lb/>
was productive only of good. Governed by itself or by <lb/>
another, it will only work you harm. I have, therefore, <lb/>
hastened to destroy it. Lo! it is now before you motionless <lb/>
and impotent.</p>
<p>For this complexity of benefit I look for no reward. I <lb/>
am not tired of well-doing. Having ceased to labor for an <lb/>
unattainable good, I have come hither to possess myself of all <lb/>
that I now crave, and by the same deed to afford you an <lb/>
illustrious opportunity to signalize your wisdom and your <reg orig="for-|titude">fortitude</reg>.</p>
<p>During this speech, the mind of Constantia became more <lb/>
deeply pervaded with dread of some over-hanging but <reg orig="in-|comprehensible">incomprehensible</reg> <lb/>
evil. The strongest impulse was, to gain a <lb/>
safe asylum, at a distance from this spot, and from the <reg orig="pre-|sence">presence</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="247" entity="eaf033v5_0260" pid="uva-lib:350526"/>
of this extraordinary being. This impulse was <reg orig="fol-|lowed">followed</reg> <lb/>
by the recollection, that her liberty was taken away; <lb/>
that egress from the hall was denied her, and that this <reg orig="re-|striction">restriction</reg> <lb/>
might be part of some conspiracy of Ormond, <lb/>
against her life.</p>
<p>Security from danger like this, would be, in the first <lb/>
place, sought, by one of Constantia's sex and opinions, in <lb/>
flight. This had been rendered, by some fatal chance, or <lb/>
by the precautions of her foe, impracticable. Stratagem or <lb/>
force was all that remained, to elude or disarm her <reg orig="adver-|sary">adversary</reg>. <lb/>
For the contrivance and execution of frauds, all the <lb/>
habits of her life and all the maxims of her education, had <lb/>
conspired to unfit her. Her force of muscles would avail <lb/>
her nothing, against the superior energy of Ormond.</p>
<p>She remembered that to inflict death, was no iniquitous <lb/>
exertion of self defence, and that the penknife which she <lb/>
held in her hand, was capable of this service. She had <lb/>
used it to remove any lurking obstruction in the wards of <lb/>
her key, supposing, for a time, this to be the cause of her <lb/>
failing to withdraw the bolt of the door. This resource, <lb/>
was, indeed, scarcely less disastrous and deplorable, than <lb/>
any fate from which it could rescue her. Some uncertainty <lb/>
still involved the intentions of Ormond. As soon as he <lb/>
paused, she spoke.</p>
<p>How am I to understand this prelude? Let me know <lb/>
the full extent of my danger; why it is that I am hindered <lb/>
from leaving this house, and why this interview was sought.</p>
<p>Ah! Constantia! This, indeed, is merely a prelude to a <lb/>
scene that is to terminate my influence over thy fate. When <lb/>
this is past, I have sworn to part with thee forever. Art <lb/>
thou still dubious of my purpose? Art thou not a woman? <lb/>
And have I not intreated for thy love, and been rejected?</p>
<p>Canst thou imagine that I aim at thy life? My avowals <lb/>
of love were sincere; my passion was vehement and <reg orig="undis-|guised">undisguised</reg>. <lb/>
It gave dignity and value to a gift in thy power, as <lb/>
a woman, to bestow. This has been denied. That gift has <lb/>
lost none of its value in my eyes. What thou refusedst to <lb/>
bestow, it is in my power to extort. I came for hat end. <lb/>
When this end is accomplished, I will restore thee to liberty.</p>
<p>These words were accompanied by looks, that rendered <lb/>
all explanation of their meaning useless. The evil reserved <lb/>
<pb n="248" entity="eaf033v5_0261" pid="uva-lib:350527"/>
for her, hitherto obscured by half disclosed and <reg orig="contradic-|tory">contradictory</reg> <lb/>
attributes, was now sufficiently apparent. The truth <lb/>
in this respect unveiled itself with the rapidity and brightness <lb/>
of an electrical flash.</p>
<p>She was silent. She cast her eyes at the windows and <lb/>
doors. Escape through them was hopeless. She looked at <lb/>
those lineaments of Ormond which evinced his disdain of <lb/>
supplication and inexorable passions. She felt that intreaty <lb/>
and argument would be vain. That all appeals to his <reg orig="com-|passion">compassion</reg> <lb/>
and benevolence would counteract her purpose, since, <lb/>
in the unexampled conformation of this man's mind, these <lb/>
principles were made subservient to his most flagitious <reg orig="de-|signs">designs</reg>. <lb/>
Considerations of justice and pity were made, by a <lb/>
fatal perverseness of reasoning, champions and bulwarks of <lb/>
his most atrocious mistakes.</p>
<p>The last extremes of opposition, the most violent <reg orig="expe-|dients">expedients</reg> <lb/>
for defence, would be justified by being indispensable. <lb/>
To find safety for her honor, even in the blood of an <reg orig="as-|sailant">assailant</reg>, <lb/>
was the prescription of duty. The equity of this <lb/>
species of defence, was not, in the present confusion of her <lb/>
mind, a subject of momentary doubt.</p>
<p>To forewarn him of her desperate purpose, would be to <lb/>
furnish him with means of counteraction. Her weapon <lb/>
would easily be wrested from her feeble hand. Ineffectual <lb/>
opposition would only precipitate her evil destiny. A rage, <lb/>
contented with nothing less than her life, might be awakened <lb/>
in his bosom. But was not this to be desired? Death, <lb/>
untimely and violent, was better than the loss of honor.</p>
<p>This thought led to a new series of reflections. She <lb/>
involuntarily shrunk from the act of killing, but would her <lb/>
efforts to destroy her adversary be effectual? Would not <lb/>
his strength and dexterity, easily repel or elude them? Her <lb/>
power, in this respect, was questionable, but her power <lb/>
was undeniably sufficient to a different end. The instrument, <lb/>
which could not rescue her from this injury, by the <reg orig="destruc-|tion">destruction</reg> <lb/>
of another, might save her from it by her own <reg orig="destruc-|tion">destruction</reg>.</p>
<p>These thoughts rapidly occurred, but the resolution to <lb/>
which they led, was scarcely formed, when Ormond advanced <lb/>
towards her. She recoiled a few steps, and, shewing the <lb/>
knife which she held, said:</p>
<pb n="249" entity="eaf033v5_0262" pid="uva-lib:350528"/>
<p>Ormond! Beware! Know that my unalterable resolution <lb/>
is, to die uninjured. I have the means in my power. Stop <lb/>
where you are; one step more, and I plunge this knife into <lb/>
my heart. I know that to contend with your strength or <lb/>
your reason, would be vain. To turn this weapon against <lb/>
you, I should not fear, if I were sure of success; but to <lb/>
that I will not trust. To save a greater good by the <reg orig="sacri-|fice">sacrifice</reg> <lb/>
of life, is in my power, and that sacrifice shall be <lb/>
made.</p>
<p>Poor Constantia! replied Ormond, in a tone of contempt; <lb/>
so! thou preferrest thy imaginary honor to life! To escape <lb/>
this injury without a name or substance. Without <reg orig="connex-|ion">connexion</reg> <lb/>
with the past or future; without contamination of thy <lb/>
purity or thraldom of thy will; thou wilt kill thyself; put <lb/>
an end to thy activity in virtue's cause; rob thy friend <lb/>
of her solace; the world of thy beneficence; thyself of <lb/>
being and pleasure?</p>
<p>I shall be grieved for the fatal issue of my experiment; <lb/>
I shall mourn over thy martyrdom to the most opprobious <lb/>
and contemptible of all errors, but that thou shouldst <reg orig="under-|go">undergo</reg> <lb/>
the trial is decreed. There is still an interval of hope, <lb/>
that thy cowardice is counterfeited, or that it will give place <lb/>
to wisdom and courage.</p>
<p>Whatever thou intendest, by way of prevention or cure, <lb/>
it behoves thee to employ with steadfastness. Die with the <lb/>
guilt of suicide and the brand of cowardice upon thy <reg orig="mem-|ory">memory</reg>, <lb/>
or live with thy claims to felicity and approbation <reg orig="un-|diminished">undiminished</reg>. <lb/>
Choose which thou wilt. Thy decision is of <lb/>
moment to thyself, but of none to me. Living or dead, <lb/>
the prize that I have in view shall be mine.&mdash;</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXIX.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">It</hi> will be requisite to withdraw your attention from this <lb/>
scene for a moment, and fix it on myself. My impatience <lb/>
of my friend's delay, for some day's preceding this disastrous <lb/>
interview, became continually more painful. As the time of <lb/>
our departure approached, my dread of some misfortune or <lb/>
impediment increased. Ormond's disappearance from the <lb/>
<pb n="250" entity="eaf033v5_0263" pid="uva-lib:350529"/>
scene, contributed but little to my consolation. To wrap <lb/>
his purposes in mystery, to place himself at seeming distance, <lb/>
was the usual artifice of such as he; was necessary to the <lb/>
maturing of his project, and the hopeless entanglement of his <lb/>
victim. I saw no means of placing the safety of my friend <lb/>
beyond his reach. Between different methods of procedure, <lb/>
there was, however, room for choice. Her present abode <lb/>
was more hazardous than an abode in the city. To be alone, <lb/>
argued a state more defenceless and perilous, than to be <lb/>
attended by me.</p>
<p>I wrote her an urgent admonition to return. My <reg orig="remon-|strances">remonstrances</reg> <lb/>
were couched in such terms, as, in my own opinion, <lb/>
laid her under the necessity of immediate compliance. The <lb/>
letter was despatched by the usual messenger, and for some <lb/>
hours I solaced myself with the prospect of a speedy meeting.</p>
<p>These thoughts gave place to doubt and apprehension. <lb/>
I began to distrust the efficacy of my arguments, and to <lb/>
invent a thousand reasons, inducing her, in defiance of my <lb/>
rhetoric, at least to protract her absence. These reasons, <lb/>
I had not previously conceived, and had not, therefore, <reg orig="at-|tempted">attempted</reg>, <lb/>
in my letter, to invalidate their force. This <reg orig="omis-|sion">omission</reg> <lb/>
was possible to be supplied in a second epistle, but, <lb/>
meanwhile, time would be lost, and my new arguments, <lb/>
might, like the old, fail to convince her. At least, the <lb/>
tongue was a much more versatile and powerful advocate <lb/>
than the pen, and by hastening to her habitation, I might <lb/>
either compel her to return with me, or ward off danger by <lb/>
my presence, or share it with her. I finally resolved to join <lb/>
her, by the speediest conveyance.</p>
<p>This resolution was suggested, by the meditations of a <lb/>
sleepless night. I rose with the dawn and sought out the <lb/>
means of transporting myself, with most celerity, to the abode <lb/>
of my friend. A stagehoat, accustomed, twice a day, to <lb/>
cross New York bay to Staten Island, was prevailed upon, <lb/>
by liberal offers, to set out upon the voyage at the dawn of <lb/>
day. The sky was gloomy, and the air boisterous and <reg orig="un-|settled">unsettled</reg>. <lb/>
The wind, suddenly becoming tempestuous and <lb/>
adverse, rendered the voyage at once tedious and full of <lb/>
peril. A voyage of nine miles was not effected in less than <lb/>
eight hours, and without imminent and hairbreadth danger <lb/>
of being drowned.</p>
<pb n="251" entity="eaf033v5_0264" pid="uva-lib:350530"/>
<p>Fifteen miles of the journey remained to be performed <lb/>
by land. A carriage, with the utmost difficulty, was <reg orig="pro-|cured">procured</reg>, <lb/>
but lank horses and a crazy vehicle were but little in <lb/>
unison with my impatience. We reached not Amboy ferry <lb/>
till some hours after nightfall. I was rowed across the <lb/>
sound, and proceeded to accomplish the remainder of my <lb/>
journey, about three miles, on foot.</p>
<p>I was actuated to this speed, by indefinite, but powerful <lb/>
motives. The belief that my speedy arrival was essential to <lb/>
the rescue of my friend from some inexplicable injury, <reg orig="haunt-|ed">haunted</reg> <lb/>
me with ceaseless importunity. On no account would I <lb/>
have consented to postpone this precipitate expedition, till <lb/>
the morrow.</p>
<p>I at length arrived at Dudley's farmhouse. The <reg orig="inhabit-|ants">inhabitants</reg> <lb/>
were struck with wonder at the sight of me. My <lb/>
clothes were stained by the water, by which every passenger <lb/>
was copiously sprinkled, during our boisterous navigation, <lb/>
and soiled by dust; my frame was almost overpowered by <lb/>
fatigue and abstinence.</p>
<p>To my anxious inquiries respecting my friend, they told <lb/>
me that her evenings were usually spent at the mansion, <lb/>
where, it was probable, she was now to be found. They <lb/>
were not apprized of any inconvenience or danger, that <lb/>
betided her. It was her custom sometimes to prolong her <lb/>
absence till midnight.</p>
<p>I could not applaud the discretion nor censure the temerity <lb/>
of this proceeding. My mind was harassed by <reg orig="unintelligi-|ble">unintelligible</reg> <lb/>
omens and self-confuted fears. To obviate the danger <lb/>
and to banish my inquietudes, was my first duty. For this <lb/>
end I hastened to the mansion. Having passed the <reg orig="inter-|vening">intervening</reg> <lb/>
hillocks and copses, I gained a view of the front of <lb/>
the building. My heart suddenly sunk, on observing that <lb/>
no apartment, not even that in which I knew it was her <lb/>
custom to sit at these unseasonable hours, was illuminated. <lb/>
A gleam from the window of the study, I should have <reg orig="re-|garded">regarded</reg> <lb/>
as an argument, at once, of her presence and her <lb/>
safety.</p>
<p>I approached the house with misgiving and faltering steps. <lb/>
The gate leading into a spacious court was open. A sound <lb/>
on one side attracted my attention. In the present state of <lb/>
my thoughts, any near or unexplained sound, sufficed to <lb/>
<pb n="252" entity="eaf033v5_0265" pid="uva-lib:350531"/>
startle me. Looking towards the quarter, whence my panic <lb/>
was excited, I espied, through the dusk, a horse grazing, <lb/>
with his bridle thrown over his neck.</p>
<p>This appearance was a new source of perplexity and <lb/>
alarm. The inference was unavoidable, that a visitant was <lb/>
here. Who that visitant was, and how he was now employed, <lb/>
was a subject of eager but fruitless curiosity. Within and <lb/>
around the mansion, all was buried in the deepest repose. <lb/>
I now approached the principal door, and looking through <lb/>
the keyhole, perceived a lamp, standing on the lowest step <lb/>
of the staircase. It shed a pale light over the lofty cieling <lb/>
and marble balustrades. No face or movement of a human <lb/>
being was perceptible.</p>
<p>These tokens assured me that some one was within; they <lb/>
also accounted for the nonappearance of light, at the window <lb/>
above. I withdrew my eye from this avenue, and was <reg orig="pre-|paring">preparing</reg> <lb/>
to knock loudly for admission, when my attention <lb/>
was awakened by some one, who advanced to the door <lb/>
from the inside, and seemed busily engaged in unlocking. <lb/>
I started back and waited with impatience, till the door <lb/>
should open and the person issue forth.</p>
<p>Presently I heard a voice within, exclaim, in accents of <lb/>
mingled terror and grief&mdash;O what&mdash;what will become of <lb/>
me? Shall I never be released from this detested prison?</p>
<p>The voice was that of Constantia. It penetrated to my <lb/>
heart like an icebolt. I once more darted a glance through <lb/>
the crevice. A figure, with difficulty recognised to be that <lb/>
of my friend, now appeared in sight. Her hands were <lb/>
clasped on her breast, her eyes wildly fixed upon the ceiling <lb/>
and streaming with tears, and her hair unbound and falling <lb/>
confusedly over her bosom and neck.</p>
<p>My sensations scarcely permitted me to <reg orig="call&mdash;Constan-|tia">call&mdash;Constantia</reg>! <lb/>
For Heaven's sake what has happened to you? Open <lb/>
the door, I beseech you.</p>
<p>What voice is that? Sophia Courtland! O my friend! I <lb/>
am imprisoned. Some d&aelig;mon has barred the door, <reg orig="be-|yond">beyond</reg> <lb/>
my power to unfasten. Ah! Why comest thou so <lb/>
late? Thy succor would have somewhat profited, if sooner <lb/>
given, but now, the lost Constantia&mdash;here her voice sunk <lb/>
into convulsive sobs.&mdash;</p>
<p>In the midst of my own despair, on perceiving the <reg orig="fulfil-|ment">fulfilment</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="253" entity="eaf033v5_0266" pid="uva-lib:350532"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">22</fw></pb>
of my apprehensions, and what I regarded as the fatal <lb/>
execution of some project of Ormond, I was not insensible <lb/>
to the suggestions of prudence. I entreated my friend to <lb/>
retain her courage, while I flew to Laffert's, and returned <lb/>
with suitable assistance to burst open the door.</p>
<p>The people of the farm house readily obeyed my <reg orig="sum-|mons">summons</reg>. <lb/>
Accompanied by three men of powerful sinews, <lb/>
sons and servants of the farmer, I returned with the utmost <lb/>
expedition to the mansion. The lamp still remained in its <lb/>
former place, but our loudest calls were unanswered. The <lb/>
silence was uninterrupted and profound.</p>
<p>The door yielded to strenuous and repeated efforts, and I <lb/>
rushed into the hall. The first object that met my sight, <lb/>
was my friend, stretched upon the floor, pale and motionless, <lb/>
supine, and with all the tokens of death!</p>
<p>From this object my attention was speedily attracted, by <lb/>
two figures, breathless and supine, like that of Constantia. <lb/>
One of them was Ormond. A smile of disdain still sat upon <lb/>
his features. The wound, by which he fell, was secret, and <lb/>
was scarcely betrayed by the effusion of a drop of blood. <lb/>
The face of the third victim was familiar to my early days. <lb/>
It was that of the imposter, whose artifice had torn from Mr <lb/>
Dudley his peace and fortune.</p>
<p>An explication of this scene was hopeless. By what <reg orig="dis-|astrous">disastrous</reg> <lb/>
and inscrutable fate, a place like this became the <lb/>
scene of such complicated havoc, to whom Craig was <reg orig="in-|debted">indebted</reg> <lb/>
for his death, what evil had been meditated or <reg orig="in-|flicted">inflicted</reg> <lb/>
by Ormond, and by what means his project had <lb/>
arrived at this bloody consummation, were topics of wild and <lb/>
fearful conjecture.</p>
<p>But my friend&mdash;the first impulse of my fears was, to <reg orig="re-|gard">regard</reg> <lb/>
her as dead. Hope and a closer observation, outrooted, <lb/>
or at least, suspended this opinion. One of the men lifted <lb/>
her in his arms. No trace of blood or mark of fatal violence <lb/>
was discoverable, and the effusion of cold water restored her, <lb/>
though slowly, to life.</p>
<p>To withdraw her from this spectacle of death was my <lb/>
first care. She suffered herself to be led to the farm house. <lb/>
She was carried to her chamber. For a time she appeared <lb/>
<pb n="254" entity="eaf033v5_0267" pid="uva-lib:350533"/>
incapable of recollection. She grasped my hand, as I sat by <lb/>
her bedside, but scarcely gave any other tokens of life.</p>
<p>From this state of inactivity she gradually recovered. I <lb/>
was actuated by a thousand forebodings, but refrained from <lb/>
molesting her by interrogation or condolence. I watched <lb/>
by her side in silence, but was eager to collect from her own <lb/>
lips, an account of this mysterious transaction.</p>
<p>At length she opened her eyes, and appeared to recollect <lb/>
her present situation, and the events which led to it. I <reg orig="in-|quired">inquired</reg> <lb/>
into her condition, and asked if there were any thing <lb/>
in my power to procure or perform for her.</p>
<p>O! my friend! she answered, what have I done; what <lb/>
have I suffered within the last dreadful hour? The <reg orig="remem-|brance">remembrance</reg>, <lb/>
though insupportable, will never leave me. You can <lb/>
do nothing for my relief. All I claim is your compassion and <lb/>
your sympathy.</p>
<p>I hope, said I, that nothing has happened to load you with <lb/>
guilt or with shame.</p>
<p>Alas! I know not. My deed was scarcely the fruit of <reg orig="in-|tention">intention</reg>. <lb/>
It was suggested by a momentary frenzy. I saw <lb/>
no other means of escaping from vileness and pollution. I <lb/>
was menaced with an evil worse than death. I forbore till <lb/>
my strength was almost subdued; the lapse of another <reg orig="mo-|ment">moment</reg> <lb/>
would have placed me beyond hope.</p>
<p>My stroke was desperate and at random. It answered <lb/>
my purpose too well. He cast at me a look of terrible <reg orig="up-|braiding">upbraiding</reg>, <lb/>
but spoke not. His heart was pierced, and he <lb/>
sunk, as if struck by lightning, at my feet. O much erring <lb/>
and unhappy Ormond! That thou shouldst thus untimely <lb/>
perish! That I should be thy executioner!</p>
<p>These words sufficiently explained the scene that I had <lb/>
witnessed. The violence of Ormond had been repulsed <lb/>
by equal violence. His foul attempts had been prevented <lb/>
by his death. Not to deplore the necessity which had <lb/>
produced this act was impossible; but, since this necessity <lb/>
existed, it was surely not a deed to be thought upon with <lb/>
lasting horror, or to be allowed to generate remorse.</p>
<p>In consequence of this catastrophe, arduous duties had <lb/>
devolved upon me. The people that surrounded me, were <lb/>
powerless with terror. Their ignorance and cowardice left <lb/>
them at a loss how to act in this emergency. They besought <lb/>
<pb n="255" entity="eaf033v5_0268" pid="uva-lib:350534"/>
my direction, and willingly performed whatever I thought <lb/>
proper to enjoin upon them.</p>
<p>No deliberation was necessary to acquaint me with my <lb/>
duty. Laffert was despatched to the nearest magistrate with <lb/>
a letter, in which his immediate presence was entreated, <lb/>
and these transactions were briefly explained. Early the <lb/>
next day the formalities of justice, in the inspection of the <lb/>
bodies and the examination of witnesses, were executed. <lb/>
It would be needless to dwell on the particulars of this <lb/>
catastrophe. A sufficient explanation has been given of the <lb/>
causes that led to it. They were such as exempted my <lb/>
friend from legal animadversion. Her act was prompted by <lb/>
motives which every scheme of jurisprudence known in the <lb/>
world not only exculpates, but applauds. To state these <lb/>
motives, before a tribunal hastily formed, and exercising its <lb/>
functions on the spot, was a task not to be avoided, though <lb/>
infinitely painful. Remonstrances, the most urgent and <reg orig="pa-|thetic">pathetic</reg>, <lb/>
could scarcely conquer her reluctance.</p>
<p>This task, however, was easy, in comparison with that <lb/>
which remained. To restore health and equanimity to my <lb/>
friend; to repel the erroneous accusations of her conscience; <lb/>
to hinder her from musing, with eternal anguish, upon this <lb/>
catastrophe; to lay the spirit of secret upbraiding by which <lb/>
she was incessantly tormented; which bereft her of repose; <lb/>
empoisoned all her enjoyments, and menaced, not only the <lb/>
subversion of her peace, but the speedy destruction of her <lb/>
life, became my next employment.</p>
<p>My counsels and remonstrances were not wholly <reg orig="ineffica-|cious">inefficacious</reg>. <lb/>
They afforded me the prospect of her ultimate <reg orig="res-|toration">restoration</reg> <lb/>
to tranquillity. Meanwhile, I called to my aid, the <lb/>
influence of time and of a change of scene. I hastened to <lb/>
embark with her for Europe. Our voyage was tempestuous <lb/>
and dangerous, but storms and perils at length gave way to <lb/>
security and repose.</p>
<p>Before our voyage was commenced, I endeavored to <reg orig="pro-|cure">procure</reg> <lb/>
tidings of the true condition and designs of Ormond. <lb/>
My information extended no further, than that he had put his <lb/>
American property into the hands of Mr. Melbourne, and <lb/>
was preparing to embark for France. Courtland, who has <lb/>
since been at Paris, and who, while there, became <reg orig="confi-|dentially">confidentially</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="256" entity="eaf033v5_0269" pid="uva-lib:350535"/>
acquainted with Martinette de Beauvais, has <reg orig="com-|municated">communicated</reg> <lb/>
facts of an unexpected nature.</p>
<p>At the period of Ormond's return to Philadelphia, at which <lb/>
his last interview with Constantia, in that city, took place, he <lb/>
visited Martinette. He avowed himself to be her brother, <lb/>
and supported his pretensions, by relating the incidents of <lb/>
his early life. A separation, at the age of fifteen, and which <lb/>
had lasted for the same number of years, may be supposed <lb/>
to have considerably changed the countenance and figure <lb/>
she had formerly known. His relationship was chiefly <lb/>
proved, by the enumeration of incidents, of which her brother <lb/>
only could be apprized.</p>
<p>He possessed a minute acquaintance with her own <reg orig="adven-|tures">adventures</reg>, <lb/>
but concealed from her the means by which he had <lb/>
procured the knowledge. He had rarely and imperfectly <lb/>
alluded to his own opinions and projects, and had maintained <lb/>
an invariable silence, on the subject of his connexion with <lb/>
Constantia and Helena. Being informed of her intention to <lb/>
return to France, he readily complied with her request to <lb/>
accompany her in this voyage. His intentions in this respect, <lb/>
were frustrated by the dreadful catastrophe that has been <lb/>
just related. Respecting this event, Martinette had collected <lb/>
only vague and perplexing information. Courtland, though <lb/>
able to remove her doubts, thought proper to withhold from <lb/>
her the knowledge he possessed.</p>
<p>Since her arrival in England, the life of my friend has <reg orig="ex-|perienced">experienced</reg> <lb/>
little variation. Of her personal deportment and <lb/>
domestic habits, you have been a witness. These, therefore, <lb/>
it would be needless for me to exhibit. It is sufficient to <lb/>
have related events, which the recentness of your intercourse <lb/>
with her hindered you from knowing, but by means of some <lb/>
formal narrative like the present. She and her friend only <lb/>
were able to impart to you the knowledge which you have <lb/>
so anxiously sought. In consideration of your merits and of <lb/>
your attachment to my friend, I have consented to devote my <lb/>
leisure to this task.</p>
<p>It is now finished, and I have only to add my wishes, that <lb/>
the perusal of this tale may afford you as much instruction, <lb/>
as the contemplation of the sufferings and vicissitudes of <lb/>
Constantia Dudley has afforded to me. Farewell.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">What</hi> could excite in you any <reg orig="curiosi-|ty">curiosity</reg> <lb/>
as to my affairs? You once knew me a simple lad, <lb/>
plying the file and tweezers at the bench of a <reg orig="watch-|maker">watchmaker</reg>, <lb/>
with no prospect before me but of laboring, for a <lb/>
few years at least, as a petty and obscure journeyman, <lb/>
at the same bench where I worked five years as an <reg orig="ap-|prentice">apprentice</reg>. <lb/>
I was sprung from obscurity, destitute of <reg orig="pro-|perty">property</reg>, <lb/>
of parents, of paternal friends; was full of that <lb/>
rustic diffidence, that inveterate humility, which are alone <lb/>
sufficient to divert from us the stream of fortune's favors.</p>
<p>Such was I three years ago! Now am I rich, happy, <lb/>
crowned with every terrestrial felicity, in possession of <lb/>
that most exquisite of all blessings, a wife, endowed with <lb/>
youth, grace, dignity, discretion.</p>
<p>I do not, on second thoughts, wonder at your <reg orig="curiosi-|ty">curiosity</reg>. <lb/>
It was impossible for me to have foreseen, absurd to <lb/>

<p>You ask me, how all these surprising things came <lb/>
about? The enclosed letters, which I have put into a <lb/>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Why</hi> do I write? For whose use do I pass my time thus? <lb/>
There is no one living who cares a jot for me. There was a <lb/>
time, when a throbbing heart, a trembling hand, and eager <lb/>
eyes, were always prepared to read, and ruminate on the <lb/>
scantiest and poorest scribble that dropped from my pen; <lb/>
but she has disappeared; the veil between us is like death.</p>
<p>Yet why should I so utterly despair of finding her? What <lb/>
all my toils may not accomplish, may be effected at a <reg orig="mo-|ment">moment</reg> <lb/>
the least expected, and in a manner the least probable. <lb/>
I may travel a thousand miles north and south, and not find <lb/>
her. I may lingeringly and reluctantly give up the fruitless <lb/>
search, and return home. A few hours after, I may stroll, in <lb/>
a melancholy, hopeless mood, into the next street&mdash;and meet <lb/>
her. By such invisible threads is the unwitting man led <lb/>
through this maze of life!</p>
<p>But how will she be met? Perhaps&mdash;horrid thought!&mdash; <lb/>
she may have become vile, polluted; and how shall I endure <lb/>
to meet her in that condition! One so delicate, carrying <lb/>
dignity to the verge&mdash;beyond the verge of pride; preferring <lb/>
to starve rather than incur contempt. But that degradation <lb/>
is impossible.</p>
<p>Yet, if she dreaded not my censure, if she despaired not <lb/>
of my acquiescence in her schemes, why conceal from me <lb/>
<pb n="6" entity="eaf033v5_0275" pid="uva-lib:350541"/>
her flight? Why not leave behind her a cold farewell. <lb/>
Could she be insensible to the torments and inquietudes, <lb/>
which her silence would entail upon me? Could she <reg orig="ques-|tion">question</reg> <lb/>
the continuance and fervency of my zeal for your <reg orig="wel-|fare">welfare</reg>? <lb/>
What have I done to estrange her heart, to awaken <lb/>
her resentment?</p>
<p>She does not live with Sedley. That question Mr. <reg orig="Phil-|lip's">Phillip's</reg> <lb/>
report has decided. At least she does not live with <lb/>
him as <hi rend="italic">his wife.</hi> Impossible that Mary Wilmot should be <lb/>
allied to any man by a different tie. It is sacrilege so much <lb/>
as to whisper to one's heart the surmise. Yet have I not <lb/>
written it? Have I not several times pondered on it? What <lb/>
has so often suggested these frightful images?</p>
<p>This mysterious, this impenetrable silence it is, that <reg orig="as-|tounds">astounds</reg> <lb/>
and perplexes me&mdash;this evident desire, which her <lb/>
conduct betrayed, to be not sought after by me, and this <reg orig="de-|parture">departure</reg> <lb/>
in company with Sedley&mdash;the man whom so long a <lb/>
devotion, so many services, had not induced her to suffer <lb/>
his visits. To sever herself thus abruptly and for ever from <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">me,</hi> to whom she had given all her tenderness, with whom <lb/>
she had divided all her cares, during years&mdash;to whom the <lb/>
marriage promise had been solemnly pledged, and trust <reg orig="her-|self">herself</reg>, <lb/>
on some long and incomprehensible journey, with one <lb/>
whom she had thought it her duty to shun&mdash;to exclude, on <lb/>
all occasions, from her company&mdash;is beyond my <reg orig="comprehen-|sion">comprehension</reg>.</p>

<p>Ah, Clara! can so groundless a punctilio govern thee? <lb/>
The settled gloom of thy aspect; thy agitation, when too <reg orig="ten-|derly">tenderly</reg> <lb/>
urged by me; thy tears, that, in spite of heroic <reg orig="reso-|lutions">resolutions</reg>, <lb/>
will sometimes find way, prove thy heart to be still <lb/>
mine.</p>
<p>But I will urge thee, I will distress thee no more. Thy <lb/>
last words have put an end to my importunity. Can I ever <lb/>
forget them, or the looks and gestures with which they were <lb/>
spoken?</p>
<p>"I never will be yours! Have I not heard all your pleas <lb/>

the means of a right judgment? I have listened to you <lb/>
twenty times upon this topic, and always patiently. Now <lb/>
listen to me.</p>
<p>"I never will be yours, while Mary's condition is unknown. <lb/>
I never will be yours, while she is single; unmarried to <reg orig="an-|other">another</reg>, <lb/>
and unhappy. I will have no intercourse with you. <lb/>
I will not grant you even my esteem, unless you search for <lb/>
her, find her, and oblige her to accept your vows.</p>
<p>"There is now no obstacle on account of fortune. <hi rend="italic">I</hi> have <lb/>
enough for several, and will give you half. All that my <reg orig="pa-|rents">parents</reg> <lb/>
have, and you know they are rich, they will either <lb/>

either case, competence, and even abundance, shall be hers <lb/>

<p>'Tis nine months since I first entered this house; not on <lb/>
the footing of a stranger or a guest, but of a child. Yet my <lb/>
claims upon my revered friend are not filial. He loves me, <lb/>
because all the virtues I possess are of his own planting and <lb/>
rearing. He that was once the pupil has now become the <lb/>
son.</p>
<p>How painful and how sweet is the review of the past year! <lb/>
How benign were the auspices under which I entered this <lb/>
house! Commended to the confidence and love of their <lb/>
daughter, treated with complacency, at first; then with <reg orig="con-|fidence">confidence</reg> <lb/>
by that daughter; and, finally, honored with her <lb/>
love. And yet, a single conversation&mdash;the mention of one <lb/>
unhappy name, has reversed totally my condition. I am still <lb/>
beloved by Clara; but that passion produces nothing but her <lb/>
misery and mine.</p>
<p>I must go, she tells me; and duty tells me that I must <lb/>
go in search of the fugitive. I will not rest till I have <reg orig="ascer-|tained">ascertained</reg> <lb/>
her destiny. Yet I can forebode nothing but evil. <lb/>
The truth, whatever it be, will avail me nothing.</p>
<p>I set out to-morrow; meanwhile Clara shall have this <lb/>
scribble; perhaps she will not spurn it. Wilt thou, Clara? <lb/>
Thou once lovedst me; perhaps, dost love me still; yet of <lb/>
that I must entertain some doubts. I part with thee <reg orig="tomor-|row">tomorrow</reg>, <lb/>
perhaps, for ever. This I will put into thy hands at <lb/>
parting.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">You</hi> knew my intention to stop, a few days, at this place, <lb/>
to see my sisters, and my old friend. I promised to write <lb/>
to you, and inform you of my welfare. I gave the promise <lb/>
with coldness and reluctance, because I predicted that no <lb/>
benefit would flow to either from our correspondence. Will <lb/>
you believe that I was a little sullen at our parting; that your <lb/>
seeming cheerfulness was construed by my perverse heart <lb/>
into something very odious? The words <hi rend="italic">inhuman</hi> and <hi rend="italic"><reg orig="in-|sensible">insensible</reg></hi> <lb/>
girl rose to my lips, and had like to have been <lb/>
uttered aloud.</p>
<p>I did not reflect, that, since you have resolved to pursue <lb/>
a certain path, my regard for you, if unmixed with <reg orig="selfish-|ness">selfishness</reg>, <lb/>
should prompt me to wish, that you may encounter as <lb/>
few asperities as possible, and to rejoice at the easiness of a <lb/>
sacrifice, which, whether difficult or easy, <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be made.</p>
<p>I had not left you a day, before my inconstant disposition <lb/>
restored me to my virtuous feelings. I repented of the <reg orig="cold-|ness">coldness</reg> <lb/>
with which I had consented to your scheme of <reg orig="corres-|pondence">correspondence</reg>, <lb/>
and tormented myself with imagining those pangs <lb/>
which my injustice must have given you. I determined to <lb/>
repair my fault as quickly as possible; to write to you often, <lb/>
and in a strain worthy of one who can enter into your <reg orig="feel-|ings">feelings</reg>, <lb/>
and estimate, at its true value, the motive which <reg orig="go-|verns">governs</reg> <lb/>
your actions.</p>
<p>I have, indeed, new and more urgent motives for writing. <lb/>
I arrived at this hospitable mansion late in the evening. I <lb/>
have retired, for the first time, to my chamber, and have <reg orig="in-|stantly">instantly</reg> <lb/>
taken up my pen. The nature of the tidings I send <lb/>
will justify my haste. I will relate what has happened, <lb/>
without further preface.</p>
<p>I approached my friend's door, and lifted the latch without <lb/>
giving any signal of my approach. I found the old gentleman, <lb/>
seated with his pipe, near the fire, and looking placidly on <lb/>
the two girls, who were busy at draughts, for which they <lb/>
<pb n="9" entity="eaf033v5_0278" pid="uva-lib:350544"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">2</fw></pb>
had made squares on the pine table, with chalk, and <reg orig="employ-|ed">employed</reg> <lb/>
yellow and red grains of corn in place of <hi rend="italic">pawns.</hi></p>
<p>They started at my entrance, and seeing who it was, <lb/>
threw themselves into my arms, in a transport of surprise and <lb/>
delight. After the first raptures of our meeting had passed, <lb/>
Mr. Hickman said to me&mdash;"Well, my boy, thou hast come <lb/>
just in time. Godfrey Cartwright has just carried away <lb/>
letters for thee. He goes to town tomorrow, and I gave <lb/>
him a packet that has lain here for some time, to put into <lb/>
the office for thee."</p>
<p>"A packet? For me? From whom?"</p>
<p>"When thou knowest the truth, thou wilt be apt to blame <lb/>
us a little, for our negligence; but I will tell thee the whole <lb/>
affair, and thou shalt judge how far we are culpable. A <lb/>
week ago, I was searching the drawers in my cherry-tree <lb/>
desk, for the copy of a bond which old Duckworth had <lb/>
placed in my hands for safe keeping, when I lighted on a <lb/>
bulky packet, sealed up, and inscribed with thy name. I <lb/>
thought it strange, that a paper of that kind should be found <lb/>
in my possession, and looked at it again and again, before I <lb/>
could comprehend the mystery. At last I noticed in the <lb/>
corner, the words `By Mr. Cartwright.' Cartwright, thou <lb/>
knowest, is the man we employ to take and bring letters to and <lb/>
from the city. Hence, I supposed it to be a packet brought <lb/>
by him on some occasion, and left here for thee; but by <lb/>
whom it was received, when it was brought, and how it <lb/>
should chance to repose in this drawer, I could not guess. I <lb/>
mentioned the affair to my sister, but she had no knowledge <lb/>
of the matter. At length, after examining the packet and <lb/>
comparing circumstances, she gradually recollected its <reg orig="his-|tory">history</reg>.</p>
<p>" `Alack-a-day!' cried she, `I do remember something of <lb/>
it now. Cartwright brought it here, just the same evening of <lb/>
the very day that poor Philip left here and went to town. I <lb/>
remember I put it into that drawer, supposing that to be as <lb/>
good a place as any to keep it safe in, till we should hear <lb/>
from the lad, and have some inkling whereabouts to send it <lb/>
to him; but, as I am a living soul, I forgot all about it from <lb/>
that day to this.'</p>
<pb n="10" entity="eaf033v5_0279" pid="uva-lib:350545"/>
<p>"Such is the history of your packet, which, you see, was <lb/>
mislaid through accident and my sister's bad memory."</p>
<p>This packet instantly connected itself, in my fancy, with <lb/>
the destiny of poor Mary. It came hither nearly at the <lb/>
time of her flight from Abingdon. It, no doubt, came from <lb/>
her, and contained information of unspeakable moment to <lb/>
our mutual happiness. When I reflected on the <reg orig="conse-|quences">consequences</reg> <lb/>
of this negligence, I could scarcely restrain my <reg orig="im-|patience">impatience</reg>. <lb/>
I eagerly inquired for the packet.</p>
<p>"Not a half-hour ago," said Hickman, "I delivered it <lb/>
to Cartwright, with directions to put it into the post-office for <lb/>
New York. He sets out early in the morning, so that thou <lb/>
wilt receive it on thy return to New York."</p>
<p>Cartwright lives five miles from this house. The least <lb/>
delay was intolerable; and, my horse not being yet <reg orig="unsad-|dled">unsaddled</reg>, <lb/>
I mounted him immediately, and set out, in spite of <lb/>
expostulation and entreaty. The night was remarkably <lb/>
gloomy and tempestuous, and I was already thoroughly <lb/>
fatigued; but these considerations were forgotten.</p>
<p>I arrived at Cartwright's hovel, in less than an hour, and <lb/>
having gotten the packet, I returned with equal despatch. <lb/>
Immediately after, I retired to my chamber, and opened the <lb/>
packet, on which I instantly recognized the well known <lb/>
hand of Miss Wilmot. I will wave all comments, and send <lb/>
you the letter.</p>

<p>I need not tell you, my friend, what I have felt, in <reg orig="conse-|quence">consequence</reg> <lb/>
of your silence. The short note which I received, a <lb/>
fortnight after you had left me, roused my curiosity and my <lb/>
fears, instead of allaying them. You promised me a longer <lb/>
account of some mysterious changes that had taken place in <lb/>
your condition. This I was to receive in a few days. At <lb/>
the end of a week I was impatient. The promised letter did <lb/>
not arrive. Four weeks passed away, and nothing came <lb/>
from you.</p>
<p>Your packet has at last put an end to suspense; but why <lb/>
did you not send it sooner? Why not send me your story <lb/>
<pb n="11" entity="eaf033v5_0280" pid="uva-lib:350546"/>
piecemeal; or, at least, tell me, in half a line, how you were <lb/>
employed, and what occasioned your delay? Why did you <lb/>
not come yourself? Philip, I am <hi rend="italic">displeased;</hi> I was going to <lb/>
say <hi rend="italic">angry</hi> with you. You have sported with my feelings. <lb/>
I ought to lay down my pen while I am in this humor. <lb/>
The pangs your negligence has given me, have not yet been <lb/>
soothed to rest, and when I find that so much unhappiness has <lb/>
been given through mere heedlessness, I can scarcely keep <lb/>
my patience.</p>
<p>I was sitting on a bench in the garden, when a country <lb/>
lad entered the enclosure. As soon as I caught a glimpse <lb/>
of him, and observed that his attention was fixed upon me, <lb/>
and his right hand already in his pocket, my heart <reg orig="whisper-|ed">whispered</reg> <lb/>
that he was the bearer of tidings from you. I attempted <lb/>
to rise and meet him, but my knees trembled so much, that <lb/>
I was obliged to give up my design. He drew forth his <lb/>
packet and threw it into my lap, answering, at the same <lb/>
time, my inquiries respecting you, by telling me that you <lb/>
were well, and that you had been busy, for a long time, <lb/>
night and day, in writing that <hi rend="italic">there</hi> letter to me. He had <lb/>
stopt a moment to give it, and could not stay, but merely to <lb/>
receive three lines from me, informing you of my health.</p>
<p>You do not deserve the favor. Besides, my fingers <reg orig="par-|take">partake</reg> <lb/>
the fluttering of my heart. A tumult of joy and <reg orig="vexa-|tion">vexation</reg> <lb/>
overpowers me. But, though you do not merit it, you <lb/>
shall have a few lines. This paper was spread upon my <lb/>
lap, and I had taken the pen to write to my aunt Bowles, <lb/>
but I will devote it to you, though my tremors, you see, <lb/>
will scarcely permit me to write legibly.</p>
<p>Your messenger chides my lingering; and I will let him <lb/>
go with nothing but a verbal message, for, on second thoughts, <lb/>
I will defer writing till I have read your long letter.</p>

<p>Yes; the narrative of Morton is true. The simple <reg orig="re-|cital">recital</reg> <lb/>
which you give, leaves me no doubt. The money is <lb/>
his, and shall be restored the moment he demands it. For <lb/>
what I have spent, I must a little while be his debtor. This <lb/>
he must consent to lose, for I never can repay it. Indeed, <lb/>
it is not much. Since my change of fortune, I have not <lb/>
been extravagant. A hundred dollars is the most I have <lb/>
<pb n="12" entity="eaf033v5_0281" pid="uva-lib:350547"/>
laid out, and some of this has been in furniture, which I <lb/>
shall resign to him.</p>
<p>Be under no concern, my friend, on my account. <lb/>
Think not how I shall endure the evils of my former <reg orig="con-|dition">condition</reg>, <lb/>
for I never shall return to it. Thy Mary is hastening <lb/>
to the grave with a very quick pace. That is her only <lb/>
refuge from humiliation and calamity, and to that she looks <lb/>
forward with more confidence than ever.</p>
<p>I was not fashioned of stubborn materials. Poverty, <lb/>
contempt, and labor, are a burden too great for me. I <lb/>
know, that for these only am I reserved, and this interval of <lb/>
better prospects was no comfort to me. I always told you <lb/>
my brother had no just claim to this money, and that the <lb/>
rightful claimant would sooner or later appear. You were <lb/>
more sanguine, and were willing to incur, even on grounds <lb/>
so imperfect, the irrevocable obligations of marriage. See <lb/>
into what a gulf your rashness would have hurried you, and <lb/>
rejoice that my obstinacy insisted on a delay of half a year.</p>
<p>You know my motives for accepting, and on what <reg orig="con-|ditions">conditions</reg> <lb/>
I accepted your proffered vows. I have never <reg orig="con-|cealed">concealed</reg> <lb/>
from you my love. What my penetration easily <lb/>
perceived, your candor never strove to conceal. Your <reg orig="in-|difference">indifference</reg>, <lb/>
your freedom from every thing like passion, was <lb/>
not only to be seen in your conduct, but was avowed by <lb/>
your lips. I was not so base as to accept your hand, <reg orig="with-|out">without</reg> <lb/>
your heart. You talked of gratitude, and duty, and <lb/>
perfect esteem. I obtained, you told me, your entire <reg orig="rev-|erence">reverence</reg>, <lb/>
and there was no female in the world whom you <lb/>
loved <hi rend="italic">so much.</hi> It was true that you did not love <hi rend="italic">me,</hi> but <lb/>
you <hi rend="italic">preferred</hi> me to all other women. Union with me was <lb/>
your supreme desire. Your reason discerned and adored <lb/>
my merits, and the concurrence of the heart could not but <lb/>
follow.</p>
<p>Fondly devoted to you as I was, and urged as these <reg orig="ar-|guments">arguments</reg> <lb/>
were, with pathetic eloquence, I could not be <reg orig="de-|ceived">deceived</reg> <lb/>
for more than a moment. My heart was filled with <lb/>
contradictory emotions. I secretly upbraided you for <reg orig="ob-|duracy">obduracy</reg> <lb/>
in withholding your love, while I, at the same time, <lb/>
admired and loved you the more for your generosity. <lb/>
Your conduct rendered the sacrifice of my happiness to <lb/>
yours the more difficult while it increased the necessity, <lb/>
<pb n="13" entity="eaf033v5_0282" pid="uva-lib:350548"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">2*</fw></pb>
and enforced the justice of that sacrifice. I could not <reg orig="dis-|cover">discover</reg> <lb/>
the probability, that marriage would give birth to that <lb/>
love which previous tenderness and kindness had been <reg orig="una-|ble">unable</reg> <lb/>
to produce. I doubted not your fidelity, and that the <lb/>
consciousness of conferring happiness would secure your <lb/>
contentment; but I felt that this was insufficient for my <lb/>
pride, if not for my love.</p>
<p>I sought your happiness. To be the author of it was the <lb/>
object of inexpressible longings. To be happy without you <lb/>
was impossible; but the misery of loneliness, however great, <lb/>
was less than that of being the spectator of your misery, or <lb/>
even that of defrauding you of the felicity attending <reg orig="mar-|riage">marriage</reg> <lb/>
with a woman whom you could truly love. <reg orig="Mean-|while">Meanwhile</reg>, <lb/>
our mutual poverty was itself an insurmountable bar <lb/>
to marriage.</p>
<p>My brother's death put me in seeming possession of <reg orig="com-|petence">competence</reg>. <lb/>
Circumstances were now somewhat changed. <lb/>
If no claimant appeared, I should be able, by giving myself <lb/>
to you, to bestow upon the object of my love that good, the <lb/>
want of which nothing can compensate. There were no <lb/>
other means of rescuing your sisters and yourself from <reg orig="indi-|gence">indigence</reg> <lb/>
and dependence. What I was willing to share with <lb/>
you, you would not share with me on any terms but those <lb/>
of wedlock.</p>
<p>Too well did I see on what weak foundations was built <lb/>
this scheme of happiness. This property was never gained <lb/>
by my brother's own industry, and how could I apply to my <lb/>
own use what I could not doubt belonged to another, though <lb/>
that other should never appear to claim it at my hands.</p>
<p>My reluctance was partly subdued by your urgency. I <lb/>
consented waveringly, and with a thousand misgivings, to be <lb/>
yours at the end of six months, if no one should appear, <lb/>
meantime, to make out a good title to this money. I <reg orig="listen-|ed">listened</reg> <lb/>
to your arguments and suppositions, by which you would <lb/>
fain account for my brother's acquisition of so large a sum <lb/>
consistenly with honesty, and for his silence as to his <reg orig="pos-|session">possession</reg> <lb/>
of it. I was willing to be convinced, and consented <lb/>
to sacrifice my peace by marrying the man I loved, because <lb/>
this marriage would secure to him the competence which I <lb/>
could not enjoy alone.</p>
<pb n="14" entity="eaf033v5_0283" pid="uva-lib:350549"/>
<p>This end cannot now be effected. New reasons have <lb/>
sprung up for foregoing your affection, even had Morton <lb/>
perished at sea. A friend has returned to you, who is far <lb/>
more able to relieve your poverty than I should be. It is <lb/>
easy to see on what conditions this relief is intended to be <lb/>
given. He has a daughter, whom he deems worthy of his <lb/>
adopted son.</p>
<p>He knows your merit, and cannot fail of perceiving that <lb/>
it places you on a level with the most accomplished of <lb/>
human beings.</p>
<p>I see how it is. This Clara will be yours. That <reg orig="intelli-|gence">intelligence</reg>, <lb/>
that mein, that gracefulness, which rustic obscurity <lb/>
cannot hide, which the garb of a clown could never <reg orig="dis-|guise">disguise</reg>, <lb/>
accompanied with the ardent commendations of her <lb/>
father, will fascinate her in a moment. I cannot hesitate <lb/>
what to wish, or how to act. That passion which a form, <lb/>
homely and uncouth like mine, tarnished and withered by <lb/>
drudgery and sorrow, and by comparative old age, for I am <lb/>
nine years older than you; which a mind, void of <reg orig="educa-|tion">education</reg>, <lb/>
and the refinements of learned and polished intercourse, <lb/>
was incapable of weakening, cannot fail to be excited by the <lb/>
youth and beauty, the varied accomplishments and ineffable <lb/>
graces of this stranger. She will offer you happiness, and <lb/>
wealth, and honor, and you will accept them at her hands.</p>
<p>As for me, I cannot be yours, because I am not my own. <lb/>
My resolution to be severed from you is unalterable; but <lb/>
this is not necessary to insure our separation. It cannot <lb/>
take place, even if all my wishes were in favor of it. Long <lb/>
before the expiration of the half year, I shall be removed <lb/>
beyond your reach. This is not the illusion of despair. I <lb/>
feel in my deepest vitals, the progress of death. Nature <lb/>
languishes within me, and every hour accelerates my decay.</p>
<p>My friend, thou must not parley with me; thou must not <lb/>
afflict me with arguments or entreaties, by letters or visits.</p>
<p>I must see thee, and hear from thee no more; but I know <lb/>
thy character too well to expect this from thee. As soon as <lb/>
thou receivest this letter, thou wilt hasten hither, and <reg orig="en-|deavor">endeavor</reg> <lb/>
to shake my purpose.</p>
<p>I am not doubtful of my own constancy, but I would save <lb/>
myself and thee from a trial that will answer no end. I <lb/>
shall leave this place early tomorrow. Whither I am going <lb/>
<pb n="15" entity="eaf033v5_0284" pid="uva-lib:350550"/>
must never be told to thee. Thy pursuit and thy inquiries <lb/>
will be incessant and anxious, but the measures I have <lb/>
taken for eluding thy search will defeat all thy efforts. I <lb/>
know that these assurances will not dissuade thee from <lb/>
making them, and I sorrow to reflect on the labors and <lb/>
anxieties to which thou wilt subject thyself for my sake; but <lb/>
I shall derive consolation from the belief that my retreat <lb/>
will <hi rend="italic">never be discovered.</hi></p>
<p>I inclose an order on the bank for the money that <reg orig="re-|mains">remains</reg> <lb/>
in it, drawn in favor of Morton, and an assignment to <lb/>
him of the few tables and chairs that furnish my lodgings <lb/>
here. These thou wilt faithfully deliver into his hands. I <lb/>
likewise return you your papers and letters.</p>
<p>And now&mdash;Philip&mdash;best and most beloved of men!&mdash; <lb/>
and is it come to this? Must I bid thee farewell for ever?</p>
<p>Do not, I beseech thee, think hardly of me for what I <lb/>
have done. Nothing but a sense of duty, nothing but a <reg orig="su-|preme">supreme</reg> <lb/>
regard to thy happiness, could suggest my design. <lb/>
I cannot falter in the execution, since I could not waver in <lb/>
the sense of my duty. I am ashamed of my weakness, <lb/>
that hinders me from pronouncing my last farewell.</p>
<p>Make haste to forget the unhappy Mary; make haste to <lb/>
the feet of your new friend, and to secure that felicity <lb/>
which an untoward fate denied me the power of bestowing.</p>
<p>My friend, my benefactor, farewell.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">I write</hi> to you, in a mood not very well suited to the <lb/>
business. I am weary and impatient. The company which <lb/>
surrounds me is alien to my temper and my habits. I want <lb/>
to shut out the tokens of their existence&mdash;to forget where I <lb/>
am, and restore myself to those rapturous scenes and that <lb/>
<pb n="16" entity="eaf033v5_0285" pid="uva-lib:350551"/>
blissful period, which preceded my last inauspicious <reg orig="meet-|ing">meeting</reg> <lb/>
with Morton.</p>
<p>I write to you, and yet I have nothing to say that will please <lb/>
you. My heart overflows with bitterness. I would pour it <lb/>
out upon <hi rend="italic">you,</hi> and yet my equity will only add new <reg orig="keen-|ness">keenness</reg> <lb/>
to my compunction, when I come to review what I <lb/>
have written. I am disposed to complain. I want an <reg orig="ob-|ject">object</reg> <lb/>
to whom to impute my disasters, and to gratify my <reg orig="mal-|ice">malice</reg> <lb/>
by upbraiding. There is a kind of satisfaction in revenge <lb/>
that I want to taste. I want to shift my anxieties from my <lb/>
own shoulders to those of another who deserves the burden <lb/>
more than I.</p>
<p>Your decision has made me unhappy. I believe your <lb/>
decision absurd, yet I know your motives are disinterested <lb/>
and heroic. I know the misery which adherence to your <lb/>
schemes costs you. It is only less than my own. Why <lb/>
then should I aggravate that misery? It is the system of <lb/>
nature that deserves my hatred and my curses&mdash;that system <lb/>
which makes our very virtues instrumental to our misery.</p>
<p>But chiefly my own folly have I to deplore&mdash;that folly <lb/>
which made me intrust to you the story of Miss Wilmot, <lb/>
bofore the bonds had been formed which no after <reg orig="repent-|ance">repentance</reg> <lb/>
could break. I ought to have forgotten her existence. <lb/>
I ought to have claimed your love and your hand. You <lb/>
would have bestowed them upon me, and my happiness <lb/>
would have been placed beyond the reach of caprice.</p>
<p>What has wrought this change in my thoughts? I set <lb/>
out from Hatfield with a heart glowing with zeal for the <lb/>
poor Mary. I burnt with impatience to throw myself at her <lb/>
feet, and tender her my vows. This zeal, time has <reg orig="extin-|guished">extinguished</reg>. <lb/>
I call to mind the perfections of another. I <lb/>
compare them with those of the fugitive. My soul droops <lb/>
at the comparison, and my tongue would find it impossible <lb/>
to utter the vows, which my untoward fate may exact from <lb/>
me.</p>
<p>Yet there is no alternative. I must finish the course that <lb/>
I have begun. I must conjure up impetuosity and zeal in this <lb/>
new cause. I must act and speak with the earnestness of <lb/>
sincerity, and the pathos of hope; otherwise I shall betray <lb/>
my cause, and violate my duty. Alas! it is vain to deny <lb/>
it, my powers are not equal to the task.</p>
<pb n="17" entity="eaf033v5_0286" pid="uva-lib:350552"/>
<p>I have inquired at the house where Mrs. Vallentine <reg orig="form-|erly">formerly</reg> <lb/>
lived. A new family are there, and no intelligence of <lb/>
the former tenant can be gained from them. This lady has <lb/>
friends, no doubt, in the city; but I know them not. It is <lb/>
chance alone that can give me their company.</p>
<p>My efforts are languid, and my prospects dim. I shall <lb/>
stay here for as short a time as possible, and then proceed <lb/>
to Virginia. I will not rest till I have restored to Mary her <lb/>
own. This money shall be faithfully delivered. To add <lb/>
my heart to the gift is impossible. With less than my <reg orig="affec-|tions">affections</reg> <lb/>
she will never be satisfied, and they are no longer mine <lb/>
to bestow,</p>
<p>Having performed this duty, what will remain for me. <lb/>
My future destiny it will be your province to prescribe. I <lb/>
shall cease, however, to reason with you, or to persuade. <lb/>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">If</hi> I thought the temper which dictated your last letter <lb/>
would continue beyond the hour or the night, I should <reg orig="in-|deed">indeed</reg> <lb/>
be unhappy.</p>
<p>My life has known much sorrow, but the sharpest pangs <lb/>
will be those arising from the sense of your unworthiness.</p>
<p>In my eyes, marriage is no sensual or selfish bargain. I <lb/>
will never <hi rend="italic">vow to honor</hi> the man who deserves only my <reg orig="con-|tempt">contempt</reg>; <lb/>
and my esteem can be secured only by a just and <lb/>
disinterested conduct. Perhaps esteem is not the only <reg orig="re-|quisite">requisite</reg> <lb/>
to marriage. Of that I am not certain; but I know <lb/>
that it is an indispensable requisite to love. I cannot love any <lb/>
thing in you but excellence. Infatuation will render you <lb/>
hateful or pitiable in my eyes. I shall hasten to forget you, <lb/>
and for that end shall estrange myself from your society, and <lb/>
drop your correspondence.</p>
<pb n="18" entity="eaf033v5_0287" pid="uva-lib:350553"/>
<p>You know what it is that reason prescribes to you with <reg orig="re-|gard">regard</reg> <lb/>
to Miss Wilmot. If you cannot ardently and sincerely <lb/>
seek her presence, and find, in the happiness which she will <lb/>
derive from a union with you, sufficient motives to make <lb/>
you zealously solicit that union, you are unworthy not merely <lb/>
of my love, but of my esteem. Henceforth I will know you <lb/>
not.</p>
<p>Let me not have reason to charge you with hypocrisy, or <lb/>
to consider your love for me as the mere child of sensuality <lb/>
and selfishness. You have often told me that you desire my <lb/>
happiness above all things&mdash;that you love me for my own <lb/>
sake. Your sincerity and rectitude are now put to the test. <lb/>
Do not belie your professions, by a blind and unjust <reg orig="de-|cision">decision</reg>. <lb/>
Allow me to judge in what it is that my happiness <lb/>
consists, and prove your attachment to me by promoting my <lb/>
happiness.</p>
<p>Misguided friend! What is it you want? To gain your <lb/>
end by exciting my pity? Suppose the end should be thus <lb/>
accomplished; suppose I should become your wife, merely <lb/>
to save your life, to prevent hazards and temptations to which <lb/>
my rejection might expose you. Mournful, indeed, full of <lb/>
anguish and of tears, would be the day which should make <lb/>
me your bride. My act would be a mere submission to <lb/>
humiliating and painful necessity. I should look to reap from <lb/>
such an alliance, nothing but repinings and sorrow. By <lb/>
soliciting my hand, by consenting to ratify a contract made <lb/>
on such principles, you would irretrievably forfeit my esteem. <lb/>
My condition would be the most disastrous that can betide a <lb/>
human being. I should be bound, beyond the power of <lb/>
loosening my bonds, to one whom I <hi rend="italic">despised.</hi></p>
<p>I am, indeed, in no danger of acting upon these principles. <lb/>
I shall never so little consult my own dignity and yours, as to <lb/>
accept your hand <hi rend="italic">through compassion.</hi> I am not unacquainted <lb/>
with the schemes which your foolish despondency has <reg orig="sug-|gested">suggested</reg> <lb/>
to you. I know very well what alternatives you have <lb/>
sometimes resolved to offer me; of compliance with your <lb/>
wishes, or of banishing you to the desert, and dissolving that <lb/>
connexion between my father and you, which is so <reg orig="advanta-|geous">advantageous</reg> <lb/>
to yourself and your sisters. Fie upon you! Even to <lb/>
have entertained such thoughts fixes a stain upon your <reg orig="charac-|ter">character</reg> <lb/>
not easily effaced. Nothing but the hope that the illusion <lb/>
<pb n="19" entity="eaf033v5_0288" pid="uva-lib:350554"/>
is transitory, and that sober reflection will, in a short time, <lb/>
relieve you from the yoke of such cowardly and ignoble <reg orig="de-|signs">designs</reg>, <lb/>
prevents this from being the last token of friendship <lb/>
you will ever receive from</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Clara,</hi> thou hast conquered me. I see the folly of my <lb/>
last letter, and deplore it. It, indeed, merited the <reg orig="indigna-|tion">indignation</reg> <lb/>
and the scorn which it has received. Never shall you <lb/>
again be grieved and provoked by the like folly. I am now <lb/>
master of my actions and my thoughts, and will steadily <lb/>
direct them to a single purpose, the pursuit of the poor Mary, <lb/>
and the promotion of her happiness.</p>
<p>How inconsistent and capricious is man! Today, his <lb/>
resolutions and motives are as adverse to those of yesterday, <lb/>
as those of one man can be, at any time and in any situation, <lb/>
to those of another. Yesterday! Heaven preserve me from <lb/>
a repetition of the same thoughts! I shudder on looking <lb/>
back upon the gulf, on the brink of which I was tottering. <lb/>
How could I so utterly forget my own interest; the regard <lb/>
due to the woman who truly loves me; to my sisters and <lb/>
my noble friend?</p>
<p>But the humiliation is now past. I think it is; I am sure <lb/>
it is. I am serene, resolute, and happy. The remorse my <lb/>
errors have produced is now at an end. Better thoughts, <lb/>
resolutions worthy of your pupil and your <hi rend="italic">friend</hi> have <reg orig="suc-|ceeded">succeeded</reg>. <lb/>
Not that my past feelings have been, perhaps, <lb/>
quite as culpable as you describe them. My repinings were <lb/>
drawn from fallacious sources, but they were not wholly <lb/>
selfish. I imagined you loved me; that my alliance with <lb/>
another, however sanctioned by your judgment, would <reg orig="pro-|duce">produce</reg> <lb/>
some regret. Believing your judgment misinformed, <lb/>
believing these regrets to be needless, I was not willing to <lb/>
create them. I need not say that this was <hi rend="italic">all</hi> my reluctance. <lb/>
That would be false; but as they partly originated hence, <lb/>
<pb n="20" entity="eaf033v5_0289" pid="uva-lib:350555"/>
my feelings were not wholly selfish; and if I may judge of <lb/>
my own emotions, surely you wrong me in calling my <reg orig="pas-|sion">passion</reg> <lb/>
by the odious name of sensual.</p>
<p>But these things are past. You have not done me <reg orig="jus-|tice">justice</reg>; <lb/>
and in return, I have imputed to you feelings, of which <lb/>
you knew nothing. Henceforth, my conduct shall convince <lb/>
you that I cannot stoop to solicit that boon from your pity, <lb/>
which is refused by your love. Conjugal claims and <reg orig="enjoy-|ments">enjoyments</reg> <lb/>
are mutual. The happiness received is always <reg orig="pro-|portioned">proportioned</reg> <lb/>
to that conferred. A wretch, worthy of eternal <lb/>
abhorrence, must <hi rend="italic">he</hi> be, and endowed with tygerlike ferocity, <lb/>
who seeks and is contented with the <hi rend="italic">person,</hi> while the heart <lb/>
is averse or indifferent. Such a one, believe me, Clara, am <lb/>
not I.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, I expect to despatch all my concerns in this <lb/>
city, and to proceed southward. Adieu,</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">There</hi> is an obscurity in your letter, my friend, that I <lb/>
cannot dispel. The first part afforded me much pleasure, <lb/>
but the sequel disappointed me. You seem to have strangely <lb/>
misconstrued my meaning. Whether this misconstruction <lb/>
be real or pretended, it does not become me to enter into <lb/>
any explanation. If it be real, it affords a proof of a narrow <lb/>
and ungenerous heart, a heart incapable of perceiving the <lb/>
possibility of sacrificing its own personal gratification to that <lb/>
of another, and of deriving, from that very sacrifice, a purer <lb/>
and more lasting felicity. It shews you unable to <reg orig="compre-|hend">comprehend</reg> <lb/>
that the welfare of another may demand selfdenial from <lb/>
us, and that in bestowing benefits on others, there is a purer <lb/>
delight than in gratifications merely selfish and exclusive.</p>
<p>You question my love, because I exhort you to do your <lb/>
duty, and to make another happy that is worthier than I. <lb/>
Why am I anxious for that other and for you? Why should <lb/>
<pb n="21" entity="eaf033v5_0290" pid="uva-lib:350556"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">3</fw></pb>
I rejoice in your integrity, and mourn for your degradation? <lb/>
Why should I harbor such glowing images of the bliss which <lb/>
your Mary would derive from a union with you? Would <lb/>
not my indifference and negligence on these heads, would <lb/>
not my ardor to appropriate your affections to myself, prove <lb/>
me to be&mdash;there is no name sufficiently abhorrent and <reg orig="con-|temptuous">contemptuous</reg> <lb/>
for such a heart.</p>
<p>And yet, such is the deportment you expect from me! <lb/>
Any thing but this will prove me to be indifferent, or averse <lb/>
to you! Desist, I beseech you, in time. If you proceed <lb/>
thus, quickly will you lose what remains of that esteem which <lb/>
I once felt for you. Instead of earnestly promoting your <lb/>
alliance with Miss Wilmot, I shall anxiously obstruct it, on <lb/>
account of your unworthiness.</p>
<p>If this misconstruction be <hi rend="italic">pretended</hi> only, if you mean to <lb/>
assail, by this new expedient, my imaginary weakness; if you <lb/>
imagine, that in order to remove an unjust imputation from <lb/>
my character, I will do what will make me really culpable; <lb/>
if you imagine that I shall degrade myself in my own <reg orig="estima-|tion">estimation</reg>, <lb/>
merely for the purpose of raising myself in yours, you <lb/>
have grossly deceived yourself.</p>
<p>Formerly you talked, with much self-complacency, of the <lb/>
trials to which I had subjected my fortitude, and <hi rend="italic">consoled</hi> <lb/>
yourself with thinking that adhering to my new scheme was <lb/>
productive of misery. I say, that you <hi rend="italic">consoled</hi> yourself with <lb/>
this reflection. In your eyes, my character was estimable <lb/>
in proportion to the reluctance with which I performed what <lb/>
was just. Your devotion to me was fervent in proportion <lb/>
as the performance of my duty was attended with <hi rend="italic">anguish</hi> <lb/>
and <hi rend="italic">suffering!</hi></p>
<p>Philip, are you, indeed, so sordid as to reason in this <reg orig="man-|ner">manner</reg>? <lb/>
Are you so blind as to account this the surest road to <lb/>
my esteem? Are you not ashamed of your infatuation and <lb/>
absurdity?</p>
<p>I need not disguise or deny my unhappiness from any pity <lb/>
to you, or through the value which I set on your esteem. <lb/>
You exult in proportion to my misery. You revere me in <lb/>
proportion as my sentiments are mean and selfish! I am <lb/>
to be upbraided and despised, in proportion to the fulness of <lb/>
that enjoyment, which the approbation of my conscience, the <lb/>
<pb n="22" entity="eaf033v5_0291" pid="uva-lib:350557"/>
sense of doing right myself, and of conferring good on others, <lb/>
has given me!</p>
<p>Let me constantly hear from you, respecting your <reg orig="move-|ments">movements</reg>. <lb/>
I am in hopes that time and reflection will instil <lb/>
into you better principles. Till then, I shall not be displeased, <lb/>
if your letter be confined to a mere narrative of your <lb/>
journey. Adieu,</p>

<p>You were to leave Philadelphia on Tuesday, you told me. <lb/>
I imagined the interval would be engrossed with business, <lb/>
and therefore expected not to hear from you, till after that <lb/>
day; but that day, and the whole week is past, and no <lb/>
tidings.</p>
<p>This silence does not proceed from sullenness&mdash;I hope, I <lb/>
persuade myselfit does not. Whatever anger you conceived <lb/>
against me, let not that, I entreat you, make you ungrateful <lb/>
to my father, cruel to your sisters, unjust to yourself.</p>
<p>Letters have been hourly expected from you, relative to <lb/>
concerns which you had in charge. Have you neglected <lb/>
them? Have you betrayed your trust? Have you suffered <lb/>
an unmanly dejection to unfit you for this charge? Have <lb/>
you committed any rashness?</p>
<p>Heaven forbid! Yet, what but some fatal event has <lb/>
occasioned this delay! Perhaps, while I thus write to you, <lb/>
you are&mdash;</p>
<p>Let me not think of it. I shiver with a deadly cold at the <lb/>
thought. Thou art fiery and impetuous, my friend. Thy <lb/>
spirit is not curbed by reason. There is no outrage on <reg orig="discre-|tion&mdash;no">discretion&mdash;no</reg> <lb/>
crime against thyself, into which thy headlong <lb/>
spirit may not hurry thee.</p>
<p>Perhaps, my last letter was harsh, unjust. My <reg orig="cen-|sures">censures</reg> <lb/>
were too bitter. I made not suitable allowances for <lb/>
your youth&mdash;the force of that attachment which you own for <lb/>
me. Knew I so little of my own nature, and the illusions <lb/>
<pb n="23" entity="eaf033v5_0292" pid="uva-lib:350558"/>
of passion, as to expect you to act and speak with perfect <lb/>
wisdom?</p>
<p>Would to Heaven I had not written that letter, or that I <lb/>
had sufficiently considered its contents before I sent it. It <lb/>
was scribbled hastily, in a moment of resentment. Of that <lb/>
which I so hastily censured in you, I was guilty myself. <lb/>
I ought to have staid till cool reflection had succeeded.</p>
<p>But, perhaps, we torment ourselves needlessly. It is <lb/>
said, that the late storms have overflowed the rivers, swept <lb/>
away the bridges, and flooded the roads. Perhaps your <lb/>
letters are delayed from this cause. Perhaps the ways have <lb/>
been impassable.</p>
<p>Mr. Talbot has been abroad during the morning. We <lb/>
expect him to return presently. He may bring us letters.</p>
<ornament type="characters">*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*</ornament>
<p>No intelligence yet received! I am excessively uneasy. <lb/>
Your friend is displeased. He is almost ready to repent <lb/>
the confidence he has placed in you. Nothing can justify <lb/>
your silence. Your sickness should not hinder you from <lb/>
informing him of certain transactions. Their importance <lb/>
required you to give him early notice of any disaster that <lb/>
might befall you, and common produce would enjoin you to <lb/>
take measures for conveying this intelligence by the hands <lb/>
of others, in case of your incapacity.</p>
<p>The coming of the post has been interrupted only for one <lb/>
day. The reason why we have not heard from you, can <lb/>
only be your not having written. My thoughts are too much <lb/>
disturbed to permit me to write any more. I will lay down <lb/>
the pen and despatch this; perhaps it may find you, and <lb/>
produce some effect.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">I write</hi> to you by the hand of another. Be not greatly <lb/>
surprised or alarmed. Perhaps my strength is equal to the <lb/>
<pb n="24" entity="eaf033v5_0293" pid="uva-lib:350559"/>
performance of this duty for myself; but my good friend, <lb/>
and affectionate nurse, Mrs. Aston, insists upon guiding the <lb/>
pen for me. She sits by my side, and promises to write <lb/>
whatever I dictate.</p>
<p>My theme is of an interesting and affecting nature. <lb/>
Perhaps it might appear to you improper to employ any <lb/>
hand but my own. Circumstances must apologize for me. <lb/>
I cannot hold the pen; the friend, whose hand I employ, <lb/>
deserves my affection and gratitude. On her discretion I <lb/>
can rely. Besides, I am now approaching a bourne where <lb/>
our scruples and reserves usually disappear. The <reg orig="suggest-|ions">suggestions</reg> <lb/>
of self interest, and the calculations of the future are <lb/>
sure to vanish at the approach of death.</p>
<p>When I wrote you last, I told you my intention to leave <lb/>
the city on Tuesday. I afterwards received your letter. <lb/>
Your censure was far more severe than my conscience told <lb/>
me I deserved. But my own heart did not secure me from <lb/>
regret. I was highly culpable to allow my peace to be <lb/>
molested by the tenor of your letter. In different <reg orig="circum-|stances">circumstances</reg>, <lb/>
I should certainly conceal from you its effect upon <lb/>
my feelings. I intended to have concealed them from you. <lb/>
I perceived that, with respect to you, I was thenceforth to <lb/>
regard myself as a stranger and an outcast, and resolved <lb/>
that you should see me and hear from me no more.</p>
<p>In embracing this scheme, I found no tranquillity. Clara, <lb/>
I loved you, and that love led me to place my supreme <lb/>
happiness in the possession of your heart. For this you call <lb/>
me sensual and selfish. This at least convinced me of one <lb/>
thing&mdash;that the happiness which I formed to myself is beyond <lb/>
my reach! It behoved me, doubtless, to dismiss all fruitless <lb/>
repinings, as well as to forbear all unprofitable efforts. My <lb/>
courage was equal to the last, but not to the first. Though <lb/>
the confession will degrade me still lower in your opinion, it <lb/>
is now no time to prevaricate or counterfeit; and I will not <lb/>
hide from you my anguish and dejection. These did not <lb/>
unfit me for performing my duty to your father, but they <lb/>
banished health and repose from my pillow.</p>
<p>I set out on Tuesday morning, for Baltimore. The usual <lb/>
floods of this season having carried away the bridge on the <lb/>
Schuylkill, we prepared to pass it in a boat. The horses <lb/>
which drew the stage being unaccustomed to this mode of <lb/>
<pb n="25" entity="eaf033v5_0294" pid="uva-lib:350560"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">3*</fw></pb>
conveyance, and being startled by the whirlpools and eddies, <lb/>
took fright, when the boat had gained the middle of the river, <lb/>
and suddenly rushed out at the further end into the stream.</p>
<p>All the passengers, except two females, had dismounted <lb/>
from the carriage before it entered the boat. The air was <lb/>
extremely cold, and a drizzling shower was falling. These <lb/>
circumstances induced the father of the two girls, who was <lb/>
one of our company, to dissuade them from alighting, as he <lb/>
imagined no danger would arise during the passage. <reg orig="Hap-|pily">Happily</reg> <lb/>
the passengers and boatmen were behind the carriage; <lb/>
so that, in rushing forward, the horses drew nothing after <lb/>
them but the coach and those in it.</p>
<p>The coach and horses instantly sunk. The curtains, on <lb/>
all sides, had been lowered and fastened; but the rushing <lb/>
waters burst the fastenings, and by a miraculous chance, the <lb/>
two females, who sat on one seat behind, were extricated in <lb/>
a moment from the poles and curtains. The coach sunk to <lb/>
the bottom, but the girls presently rose to the surface.</p>
<p>I threw off my upper and under coat in a moment, and <lb/>
watching the place of their reappearance, plunged into the <lb/>
water, and by the assistance of others, lifted one breathless <lb/>
corpse into the boat. Meanwhile, the father, more terrified, <lb/>
and less prudent, threw himself cloaked and encumbered as <lb/>
he was, into the water, to save his children. Instead of <lb/>
effecting this, he was unable to save himself. No one <reg orig="fol-|lowed">followed</reg> <lb/>
my example in plunging into the river, and the father <lb/>
and one of his children perished together.</p>
<p>The immediate consequence of this exposure, in a <reg orig="fever-|ish">feverish</reg> <lb/>
state of my frame, was a violent ague, which gave place <lb/>
to a high fever and delirium. I stopt at the inn on the <reg orig="op-|posite">opposite</reg> <lb/>
bank, to change my wet clothes for dry; but, having <lb/>
done this, was unable to proceed, and betook myself to my <lb/>
bed. I suspected nothing more than an intermittent, which, <lb/>
however violent during its prevalence, would pass away in <lb/>
less than an hour. In this I was mistaken.</p>
<p>My understanding was greatly disturbed. I had no <reg orig="re-|membrance">remembrance</reg> <lb/>
of the past, or foresight of the future. All was <lb/>
painful confusion, which has but lately disappeared. Clear <lb/>
conceptions have returned to me, but my strength is gone, <lb/>
and I feel the cold of death gradually gaining on my heart. <lb/>
My force of mind is not lessened. I can talk and reason as <lb/>
<pb n="26" entity="eaf033v5_0295" pid="uva-lib:350561"/>
coherently as ever; and my conclusions are far more wise <lb/>
than while in perfect health.</p>
<p>The family of Mr. Aston, residing in this neighborhood, <lb/>
hearing of my condition, have afforded me every succor and <lb/>
comfort I needed. It was not till this moment that I have <lb/>
been able to employ the suitable means of conveying to you <lb/>
tidings of these events. Your letter has just been brought <lb/>
me from the post-office, and my good friend, who now holds <lb/>
the pen, and who has watched by my pillow during my <reg orig="sick-|ness">sickness</reg>, <lb/>
was good enough to read it to me.</p>
<p>What shall I say? To one regarding me as selfish and <lb/>
unjust; as even capable of villany and foul ingratitude; who <lb/>
among so many conjectures, as to the cause of my silence, <lb/>
was ready to suspect me of breach of faith, the low guilt of <lb/>
embezzlement! what shall I say?</p>
<p>Nothing; I can say nothing. The prayers of a dying <lb/>
man for thy felicity, Clara, will, at least, be accepted as <reg orig="sin-|cere">sincere</reg>. <lb/>
There is no personal motive to vitiate this prayer. <lb/>
Thy happiness must, henceforth, be independent of mine. I <lb/>
can neither be the author nor partaker of it. Be thou, lovely <lb/>
and excellent woman! <hi rend="italic">be happy!</hi></p>
<p>I break off here, to write to your father. I have much to <lb/>
say to him which another day, perhaps another hour, may <lb/>
for ever prevent me from saying.</p>

find you out; to restore you to health, to bring you back to <lb/>
us alive and happy.</p>
<p>Good God! what horrible infatuation was it that made me <lb/>
write as I did! If thou diest, just&mdash;just will be my punishment. <lb/>
Never more will I open my eyes to the light.</p>
<pb n="27" entity="eaf033v5_0296" pid="uva-lib:350562"/>
<p>My father, my mother, will not suffer me to go to thee&mdash; <lb/>
to see thee once more; to receive thy last sigh; to clasp thy <lb/>
cold remains; to find my everlasting peace in the same <lb/>
grave. They will not hearken to me; they will not suffer <lb/>
me to go.</p>
<p>In my frantic thoughts, I ran to the water's edge. I was <lb/>
stepping into the boat to cross the river, determined to see <lb/>
thee ere a new day returned, but I was pursued. I am <reg orig="de-|tained">detained</reg> <lb/>
by force; by entreaties more powerful than bonds and <lb/>
fetters.</p>
<p>I need not go. Thou art gone for ever. My prayer for <lb/>
forgiveness thou canst not hear. Heaven has denied me <lb/>
the power to repair the wrongs that I have done thee. To <lb/>
expiate my folly, to call thee back to my bosom, and to give <lb/>
my stubborn heart to thy possession, cannot be for the <lb/>
wretched</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Do</hi> you wish for some account of my present situation? <lb/>
I will readily comply with your request. I am, indeed, in <lb/>
a mood, just now, extremely favorable to the telling of a <lb/>
long story. I have no companions in this city, and various <lb/>
circumstances, while they give me a few days solitude and <lb/>
leisure, strongly incline me likewise to ruminate and <reg orig="moral-|ize">moralize</reg> <lb/>
on past adventures.</p>
<p>When I last wrote to you, I told you my destiny had <reg orig="un-|dergone">undergone</reg> <lb/>
surprising changes since we parted. I had then no <lb/>
leisure to enter into minute particulars. Alas! my friend, <lb/>
changes still more surprising have since occurred, but <lb/>
changes very different from those to which I then alluded. <lb/>
Then they were all benign and joyous; since, they have <lb/>
been only gloomy and disastrous.</p>
<p>But how far must I go back to render my narrative <reg orig="intel-|ligible">intelligible</reg>? <lb/>
You went your voyage, if I mistake not, just after <lb/>
I was settled, with my uncle and sisters, in the neighborhood <lb/>
of Hatfield. I believe you were acquainted with the <reg orig="be-|ginning">beginning</reg>, <lb/>
at least of my intercourse with Mr. Howard. I <lb/>
described to you, I believe, the dignified, grave and secluded <lb/>
deportment of that man; the little relish he appeared to <lb/>
have for the society around, and the flattering regards he <lb/>
bestowed on me.</p>
<p>I was a mere country lad, with little education but what <lb/>
was gained by myself; diffident and bashful as the rawest <lb/>
inexperience could make me. He was a man of elevated <lb/>
and sedate demeanor; living, if not with splendor, yet with <lb/>
elegance; withdrawing, in a great degree, from the society <lb/>
of his neighbors; immersed in books and papers, and wholly <lb/>
given to study and contemplation.</p>
<p>I shall never forget the occasion on which he first honored <lb/>
me with his notice; the unspeakable delight which his <lb/>
increasing familiarity and confidence, my admission to his <lb/>
house, and my partaking of his conversation and instructions, <lb/>
afforded me. I recollect the gradual disappearance, in his <lb/>
<pb n="31" entity="eaf033v5_0300" pid="uva-lib:350566"/>
intercourse with me, of that reserve and austerity, which he <lb/>
still maintained to the rest of mankind, with emotions of <lb/>
gratitude and pleasure unutterable.</p>
<p>He had reason to regard me, indeed, somewhat like his <lb/>
own son. I had no father; I had no property; there was <lb/>
no one among my own relations, who had any particular <lb/>
claim upon my reverence or affection. A thousand tokens <lb/>
in my demeanor, must have manifested a veneration for him <lb/>
next to idolatry. My temper was ardent and impetuous, <lb/>
and several little incidents occurred, during the many years <lb/>
that I frequented his house, that brought forth striking proofs <lb/>
of my attachment to him. I greedily swallowed his lessons, <lb/>
and remember how often his eyes sparkled, his countenance <lb/>
brightened into smiles, and his tongue lavished applause, on <lb/>
my wonderful docility and rapid progress. He shewed his <lb/>
affection for me, by giving his instructions, inquiring into my <lb/>
situation, and directing me in every case of difficulty that <lb/>
occurred; but he never offered to become my real father; <lb/>
to be at the expense of my subsistence, or my education to <lb/>
any liberal profession. Indeed, he was anxious to persuade <lb/>
me that the farmer's life was the life of true dignity, and that, <lb/>
however desirable to me property might be, I ought to <lb/>
entertain no wish to change my mode of life. That was a <lb/>
lesson which he was extremely assiduous to teach.</p>
<p>He never gave me money, nor ever suffered the slightest <lb/>
hint to escape him that he designed to carry his munificence <lb/>
any farther than to lend me his company, his conversation, <lb/>
and his books. Indeed, in my attachment to him, there <lb/>
was nothing sordid or mercenary. It never occurred to <lb/>
me to reflect on this frugality, this limitation of his bounty. <lb/>
What he gave was, in my own eyes, infinitely beyond my <lb/>
merits; and instead of panting after more, I was only <reg orig="aston-|ished">astonished</reg> <lb/>
that he gave me so much. Indeed, had I had wisdom <lb/>
enough to judge of appearances, I should have naturally <lb/>
supposed that there existed many others who had stronger <lb/>
claims upon his fortune than I had, and might actually enjoy <lb/>
his bounty.</p>
<p>His family and situation were, indeed, wholly unknown <lb/>
to me and his neighbors. He was a native of Britain; had <lb/>
not been long in America; lived alone, and in affluence; <lb/>
was a man past the middle of life; enjoyed a calm, studious, <lb/>
<pb n="32" entity="eaf033v5_0301" pid="uva-lib:350567"/>
and contemplative existence. This was the sum of all the <lb/>
knowledge I ever obtained of him. Indeed, my curiosity <lb/>
never carried me into stratagems or guesses, in order to <reg orig="dis-|cover">discover</reg> <lb/>
what he did not voluntarily disclose, or what he was <lb/>
desirous to conceal.</p>
<p>The mournful day of his departure from Hatfield, and <lb/>
from America, at last arrived. I never was taught to believe <lb/>
that he designed to pass his life in America. I naturally <lb/>
regarded him as merely a sojourner, but never inquired <lb/>
how long he meant to stay among us. When he told me, <lb/>
therefore, that he should embark in a week, I felt no <reg orig="sur-|prise">surprise</reg>, <lb/>
though it was impossible to conceal my impatience <lb/>
and regret. I never felt a keener pang than his last embrace <lb/>
gave me.</p>
<p>He parted from me with every mark of paternal <reg orig="tender-|ness">tenderness</reg>. <lb/>
Yet he left nothing behind him as a memorial of his <lb/>
affection. Even the books that I had often read under his <lb/>
roof, some of which were my chief favorites, and would <lb/>
have been prized, for the donor's sake, beyond their weight <lb/>
in rubies, he carried away with him. Neither did he <lb/>
explain the causes of his voyage, or give me any <reg orig="expecta-|tion">expectation</reg> <lb/>
of seeing him again.</p>
<p>My obligations to Mr. Howard cannot be measured. To <lb/>
him am I indebted for whatever distinguishes me from the <lb/>
stone which I turned up with my plough, or the stock which <lb/>
I dissevered with my axe. My understanding was awakened, <lb/>
disciplined, informed; my affections were cherished, <reg orig="exer-|cised">exercised</reg>, <lb/>
and regulated by him. My heart was penetrated <lb/>
with a sentiment, in regard to him&mdash;perhaps it would be <lb/>
impious to call it devotion&mdash;the divinity only can claim that; <lb/>
yet this man was a sort of divinity to me&mdash;the substitute <lb/>
and representative of heaven, in my eyes, and for my good.</p>
<p>I besought him to let me accompany him. I anxiously <lb/>
inquired whether I might cherish the hope of ever seeing <lb/>
him again? The first request he made me ashamed of <lb/>
ever having urged, by shewing me that I had sisters who <lb/>
needed my protection, and for whose sake I ought to labor <lb/>
to attain independence. His own destiny would be <reg orig="regu-|lated">regulated</reg> <lb/>
by future events, but he deemed it most probable that <lb/>
we should never see each other more.</p>
<pb n="33" entity="eaf033v5_0302" pid="uva-lib:350568"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">4</fw></pb>
<p>The melancholy inspired by this separation from one who <lb/>
was not only my best, but my sole friend, was not dissipated <lb/>
like other afflictions of youth, by the lapse of a few months. <lb/>
Being accompanied with absolute uncertainty as to his <reg orig="con-|dition">condition</reg> <lb/>
and place of residence, it produced the same effect <lb/>
that his death would have done. This melancholy, though <lb/>
no variety of scene could have effaced it, was, no doubt, <lb/>
aggravated by the cheerless solitude in which I was placed. <lb/>
The rustic life was wholly unsuitable to my temper and <lb/>
taste. My active mind panted for a nobler and wider <lb/>
sphere of action; and after enduring the inconveniences of <lb/>
my sequestered situation for some time, I, at length, bound <lb/>
myself apprentice to a watchmaker in the city. My genius <lb/>
was always turned towards mechanics, and I could imagine <lb/>
no art more respectable or profitable than this.</p>
<p>Shortly after my removal to this city, I became <reg orig="acquaint-|ed">acquainted</reg> <lb/>
with a young man by the name of Wilmot. There were <lb/>
many points of resemblance between us. We were equally <lb/>
fond of study and reflection, and the same literary pursuits <lb/>
happened to engage our passions. Hence a cordial and <lb/>
incessant intercourse took place between us.</p>
<p>I suppose you know nothing of Wilmot. Yet possibly <lb/>
you have heard something of the family. They were of <lb/>
no small note in Delaware. Not natives of the country. <lb/>
The father was an emigrant, who brought a daughter and <lb/>
this son with him, when children, from Europe. He <reg orig="pur-|chased">purchased</reg> <lb/>
a delightful place on the <hi rend="italic">Brandywine,</hi> built a house, <lb/>
laid out gardens, and passed a merry life among horses, dogs, <lb/>
and boon companions. He died, at length, by a fall from <lb/>
his horse, when his daughter Mary was sixteen years of age, <lb/>
and the son four or five years younger.</p>
<p>These children had been trained up in the most luxurious <lb/>
manner. The girl had been her own mistress, and the <lb/>
mistress of her father's purse, from a very early age. All <lb/>
the prejudices and expectations of an heiress were early and <lb/>
deeply imbibed by her; and her father's character had <lb/>
hindered her from forming any affectionate or useful friends <lb/>
of her own sex, while those who called themselves <hi rend="italic">his</hi> friends <lb/>
were either merely jovial companions or cunning creditors. <lb/>
It very soon appeared that Wilmot's fortune had lasted just <lb/>
as long as his life. House, and land, and stock, were sold by <lb/>
<pb n="34" entity="eaf033v5_0303" pid="uva-lib:350569"/>
auction, to discharge his numerous debts, and nothing but a <lb/>
surplus on the sale of the furniture remained to the heirs.</p>
<p>Mary, after a recluse and affluent education, was thus <lb/>
left, at the inexperienced age of sixteen, friendless and <reg orig="for-|lorn">forlorn</reg>, <lb/>
to find the means of subsistence for herself and her <lb/>
brother, in her own ingenuity and industry. It cannot be <lb/>
supposed that she escaped all the obvious and enervating <lb/>
effects of such an education. Her pride was sorely wounded <lb/>
by this reverse, but nature had furnished her with a vigorous <lb/>
mind, which made it impossible for her to sink, either into <lb/>
meanness or despair. She was not wise enough to endure <lb/>
poverty and straitened accommodations, and a toilsome <lb/>
calling, with serenity; but she was strenuous enough to adopt <lb/>
the best means for repairing the ills that oppressed her.</p>
<p>She retired, with the wreck of her father's property, from <lb/>
the scene in which she had been accustomed to appear with <lb/>
a splendor no longer hers. Her sensibility found <reg orig="consola-|tion">consolation</reg> <lb/>
in living obscure and unknown. For this end, she <lb/>
removed to this city, took cheap lodgings in the suburbs, <lb/>
and reduced all her expenses to the most frugal standard. <lb/>
With the money she brought with her, she placed her brother <lb/>
at a reputable grammar school; and her acquaintance, by <lb/>
very slow degrees, extending beyond her own roof among <lb/>
the good and considerate part of the community, she acquired, <lb/>
by the exercise of the needle, a slender provision for herself <lb/>
and her brother.</p>
<p>The boy was a noble and generous spirit, and endowed with <lb/>
an ardent thirst of knowledge. He made a rapid progress <lb/>
in his learning, and at the age of sixteen, became usher in the <lb/>
school in which he had been trained. He was smitten with <lb/>
the charms of literature; and greatly to his sister's <reg orig="disap-|pointment">disappointment</reg> <lb/>
and vexation, refused to engage in any of those <lb/>
professions which lead to riches and honor. He adopted <lb/>
certain antiquated and unfashionable notions about the "<reg orig="gran-|deur">grandeur</reg> <lb/>
of retreat," "honorable poverty," a studious life, and <lb/>
the dignity of imparting knowledge to others. The desk, bar, <lb/>
and pulpit, had no attractions for him. This, no doubt, partly <lb/>
arose from youthful timidity and self diffidence, and age might <lb/>
have insensibly changed his views.</p>
<p>My intercourse with Wilmot introduced me, of course, to <lb/>
the knowledge of his sister. I usually met him at her <reg orig="lodg-|ings">lodgings</reg>. <lb/>
<pb n="35" entity="eaf033v5_0304" pid="uva-lib:350570"/>
Sundays and all our evenings were spent together; <lb/>
and as Mary had few or no visitants, on her own account, <lb/>
she was nearly on the same footing of domestic familiarity <lb/>
with me, as with her brother.</p>
<p>She was much older than I. Humiliation and anxiety <lb/>
had deeply preyed on her constitution, which had never been <lb/>
florid or robust, and made still less that small portion of <lb/>
external grace or beauty, which nature had conferred upon <lb/>
her. Dignity, however, was conspicuous in her deportment, <lb/>
and intelligence glowed in her delicate and pliant features. <lb/>
Her manners were extremely mild, her voice soft and musical, <lb/>
and her conversation full of originality and wisdom. The <lb/>
high place to which she admitted me in her esteem, and the <lb/>
pleasure she took in my company, demanded my esteem and <lb/>
gratitude in return. In a short time, she took place of her <lb/>
brother in my confidence and veneration.</p>
<p>I never loved Mary Wilmot. Disparity of age, the dignity <lb/>
and sedateness of her carriage, and perhaps the want of <reg orig="per-|sonal">personal</reg> <lb/>
attractions, inspired me with a sentiment very different <lb/>
from love. Yet there was no sacrifice of inclination which I <lb/>
would not cheerfully have made, in the cause of her <reg orig="happi-|ness">happiness</reg>. <lb/>
Though union with her could not give me the raptures <lb/>
that fortunate love is said to produce, it was impossible to <lb/>
find them with another while she was miserable.</p>
<p>I had no experience of the passions. I knew, and <reg orig="con-|versed">conversed</reg> <lb/>
with no woman but Mary, and imagined that no <lb/>
human being possessed equal excellences. I had no counter <lb/>
longing to contend with; and, to say truth, did not suspect <lb/>
that my regard for any woman, could possibly be carried <reg orig="fur-|ther">further</reg> <lb/>
than what I felt for her.</p>
<p>Mary's knowledge of the heart, the persuasion of her <lb/>
own defects, or her refined conception of the passions, made <lb/>
her less sanguine and impetuous. Her love was to be <reg orig="indis-|putably">indisputably</reg> <lb/>
requited by a love as fervent, before she would permit <lb/>
herself to indulge in hopes of felicity, or allow me to esteem, <lb/>
in her, my future wife. Our mutual situation by no means <lb/>
justified marriage. Secure and regular means of subsistence <lb/>
were wanting, as I had, somewhat indiscreetly, bound myself <lb/>
to serve a parsimonious master, for a much longer period <lb/>
than was requisite to make me a proficient in my art. <lb/>
<pb n="36" entity="eaf033v5_0305" pid="uva-lib:350571"/>
Meanwhile, there subsisted between us the most <reg orig="affection-|ate">affectionate</reg> <lb/>
and cordial intercourse, such as was worthy of her love, <lb/>
and my boundless esteem.</p>
<p>As long as the possibility of marriage was distant, this <lb/>
discord of feelings was of less moment. A very great <lb/>
misfortune, however, seemed to have brought it, for a time, <lb/>
very near. Wilmot embarked on the river, in an evil hour, <lb/>
and the boat being upset by a gust of wind, was drowned. <lb/>
The brother and sister tenderly loved each other, and this <lb/>
calamity was long and deeply deplored by the survivor. <lb/>
One unexpected good, however, grew out of this event. <lb/>
Wilmot was found to be credited in the bank of P. for so <lb/>
large a sum as five thousand dollars.</p>
<p>You will judge of the surprise produced by such a <reg orig="dis-|covery">discovery</reg>, <lb/>
when I tell you that this credit appeared to have <lb/>
been given above two years before Wilmot's death; that we, <lb/>
his constant and intimate associates, had never heard the <lb/>
slightest intimation of his possessing any thing beyond the <lb/>
scanty income of his school; that his expenses continued, <lb/>
till the day of his death, perfectly conformable to the known <lb/>
amount of this wretched income; and that no documents <lb/>
could be found among his papers, throwing any light on the <lb/>
mystery.</p>
<p>I shall not recount the ten thousand fruitless conjectures <lb/>
that were formed to account for this circumstance. None <lb/>
was more probable than that Wilmot held this money for <lb/>
another. Mary was particularly confident of the truth of <lb/>
this conclusion, though to me it was not unembarrassed with <lb/>
difficulties, for why was no written evidence, no <reg orig="memoran-|dum">memorandum</reg> <lb/>
or letter, to be found respecting the trust? and why did <lb/>
he maintain so obstinate a silence on the subject to us, to <lb/>
whom he was accustomed to communicate every action and <lb/>
every thought?</p>
<p>We endeavored to recollect Wilmot's conversation and <lb/>
deportment, at the time this money was deposited by him, <lb/>
in his own name, in the bank. This clue seemed to lead to <lb/>
some discovery. I well remembered a thoughtfulness, at that <lb/>
period, not usual in my friend, and a certain conversation, <lb/>
that took place between us, on the propriety of living on the <lb/>
bounty of others, when able to maintain ourselves by our own <lb/>
industry. I short, I was extremely willing to conclude that <lb/>
<pb n="37" entity="eaf033v5_0306" pid="uva-lib:350572"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">4*</fw></pb>
this money had been a present to Wilmot, from some paternal <lb/>
friend of his family, or, perhaps, some kinsman from a <reg orig="dis-|tance">distance</reg>. <lb/>
At all events, as this sum had lain undisturbed in <lb/>
the bank for two years, I saw no reason why it should not <lb/>
be applied to the purpose of subsistence, by his sister, to <lb/>
whom it now fully belonged.</p>
<p>It was difficult to overcome her scruples. At length she <lb/>
determined to use as small a part as her necessities could <lb/>
dispense with, and to leave the rest untouched for half a year <lb/>
longer, when, if no claimant appeared, she might use it with <lb/>
less scruple. This half year of precaution expired, and <lb/>
nobody appeared to dispute her right.</p>
<p>She now became extremely anxious to divide this sum, <lb/>
gratuitously, with me. To me, the only obstacle to marriage <lb/>
was, the want of property. This obstacle, if Mary Wilmot <lb/>
consented to bestow her hand where her heart had long <lb/>
reposed, would be removed. It was difficult, however, to <lb/>
persuade her to accept a man on whom she doated; but <lb/>
who, though urgent in his proffers, was not so deeply in love <lb/>
as herself. At length, she consented to be mine, provided, <lb/>
at the end of another half year, I should continue equally <lb/>
desirous of the gift.</p>
<p>At this time I was become my own master, and having <lb/>
placed Mary in a safe and rural asylum at Abingdon, I paid <lb/>
a visit of a few weeks to my uncle near Hatfield. I had <lb/>
been here scarcely a fortnight, when, one evening, a stranger <lb/>
whom I had formerly known in my boyish days, as the son <lb/>
of a neighboring farmer, paid me a visit. This person had <lb/>
been abroad for several years, on mercantile adventures, <lb/>
in Europe and the West Indies. He had just returned, <lb/>
and after various ineffectual inquiries after Wilmot, with <lb/>
whom he had formerly been in habits of confidence, he had <lb/>
come to me, in the prosecution of the same search.</p>
<p>After various preliminaries, he made me acquainted with <lb/>
the purpose of his search. The substance of his story was <lb/>
this;&mdash;After toiling for wealth, during several years, in <reg orig="dif-|ferent">different</reg> <lb/>
ports of the Mediterranean, he at length acquired <lb/>
what he deemed sufficient for frugal susbsistence in America. <lb/>
His property he partly invested in a ship and her cargo, <lb/>
and partly in a bill of exchange for <hi rend="italic">five thousand dollars.</hi> <lb/>
<pb n="38" entity="eaf033v5_0307" pid="uva-lib:350573"/>
This bill he transmitted to his friend Wilmot, with directions <lb/>
to reserve the proceeds till his arrival. He embarked, <lb/>
meanwhile, in his own vessel, sending, at the same time, <lb/>
directions to his wife, who was then at Glasgow, to meet him <lb/>
in America.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the ship was wrecked on the coast of <lb/>
Africa; the cargo was plundered or destroyed by the savage <lb/>
natives, and he, and a few survivors, were subjected to <reg orig="innu-|merable">innumerable</reg> <lb/>
hardships, and the danger of perpetual servitude. <lb/>
From this he was delivered by the agents of the United <lb/>
States, in consequence of a treaty being ratified between <hi rend="italic">us</hi> <lb/>
and the government of Algiers. Morton was among the <lb/>
miserable wretches whose chains were broken on that <reg orig="occa-|sion">occasion</reg>, <lb/>
and he had just touched the shore of his native country.</p>
<p>His attention was naturally directed, in the first place, to <lb/>
the fate of the property transmitted to Wilmot. Wilmot, he <lb/>
heard, died suddenly. Wilmot's sister, his only known <reg orig="rela-|tion">relation</reg>, <lb/>
was gone, nobody could tell whither. The merchant <lb/>
on whom his bills had been drawn, was partner in a <reg orig="Ham-|burgh">Hamburgh</reg> <lb/>
house, to which he had lately returned. The ships in <lb/>
which he sent his letters had safely arrived. His bills had <lb/>
never been protested at any of the notaries, but all the written <lb/>
evidences of this transaction, that had remained in his own <lb/>
hands, had been buried, with his other property, in the <lb/>
waves.</p>
<p>After some suspense, and much inquiry, he was directed <lb/>
to me, as the dearest friend of Wilmot, and the intended <lb/>
husband of his sister.</p>
<p>You will see, my friend, that the mystery which perplexed <lb/>
us so long, was now at an end. The coincidence between <lb/>
the sum remitted, and that in our possession, and between <lb/>
the time of the probable receipt of the bills, and that of the <lb/>
deposit made by Wilmot at the bank, left me in no doubt <lb/>
as to the true owner of the money.</p>
<p>I explained to Morton, with the utmost clearness and <lb/>
simplicity, every particular relative to this affair. I <reg orig="ac-|knowledged">acknowledged</reg> <lb/>
the plausibility of his claim; assured him of <lb/>
Miss Wilmot's readiness, and even eagerness, to do him <reg orig="jus-|tice">justice</reg>, <lb/>
and promised to furnish him, on his return to <reg orig="Philadel-|phia">Philadelphia</reg>, <lb/>
with a letter, introducing him to my friend. We <lb/>
parted.</p>
<pb n="39" entity="eaf033v5_0308" pid="uva-lib:350574"/>
<p>This was a most heavy and unlooked for disappointment <lb/>
of all our schemes of happiness. My heart bled with <reg orig="com-|passion">compassion</reg> <lb/>
for the forlorn and destitute Mary. To be thus <lb/>
rescued from obscurity and penury, merely to have these <lb/>
evils augmented by the bitterness of disappointment, was <lb/>
a hard lot.</p>
<p>I was just emancipated from my servitude. I was <reg orig="per-|fectly">perfectly</reg> <lb/>
skilled in my art, but mere skill might supply myself <lb/>
with scanty bread, without enabling me to support a family. <lb/>
For that end, credit to procure a house, and the means of <lb/>
purchasing tools and materials, were necessary; but I knew <lb/>
not which way to look for them.</p>
<p>My nearest relation was my uncle Walter, who had taken <lb/>
me and my sisters, in our infancy, into his protection, and had <lb/>
maintained the girls ever since. His whole property, <reg orig="how-|ever">however</reg>, <lb/>
was a small farm, whose profits were barely sufficient <lb/>
to defray the current expenses of his family. At his death, <lb/>
this asylum would be lost to us, as his son, who would then <lb/>
become the occupant, had always avowed the most <reg orig="malig-|nant">malignant</reg> <lb/>
envy and rancorous aversion to us. As my uncle was <lb/>
old, and of a feeble constitution, and as the girls were still <lb/>
young and helpless, I had abundant theme on my own <reg orig="ac-|count">account</reg>, <lb/>
for uneasy meditation. To these reflections were <lb/>
added the miseries, which this reverse of fortune would <lb/>
bring down upon the woman whom I prized beyond all the <lb/>
world.</p>
<p>One day, while deeply immersed in such contemplations <lb/>
as these, and musefully and mournfully pacing up and down <lb/>
the piazza of the inn at Hatfield, a chaise came briskly up <lb/>
to the door and stopped. I lifted my eyes, and beheld, <lb/>
alighting from it, a venerable figure, in whom I instantly <lb/>
recognised my friend and benefactor, Mr. Howard. The <lb/>
recognition was not more sudden on my side than on his, <lb/>
though a few years, at my age, were sufficient to produce <lb/>
great changes in personal appearance. Surprise and joy <lb/>
nearly deprived me of my senses, when he took me in his <lb/>
arms and saluted me in the most paternal manner. We <lb/>
entered the house, and as soon as I regained my breath, I <lb/>
gave utterance to my transports, in the most extravagant <lb/>
terms.</p>
<p>After the first emotion had subsided, he informed me that <lb/>
<pb n="40" entity="eaf033v5_0309" pid="uva-lib:350575"/>
the sole object of his present journey to Hatfield was a <reg orig="meet-|ing">meeting</reg> <lb/>
with me. He had just arrived, with a wife and <reg orig="daugh-|ter">daughter</reg>, <lb/>
in America, where he designed to pass the rest of his <lb/>
days. It was his anxious hope to find me well and in my <lb/>
former situation, as he was now able to take the care of <reg orig="pro-|viding">providing</reg> <lb/>
for me into his own hands. He inquired minutely <reg orig="in-|to">into</reg> <lb/>
my history since we parted. I could not immediately <lb/>
conquer my reserve, on that subject nearest my heart; but <lb/>
in other respects, I was perfectly explicit.</p>
<p>My narrative seemed not to displease him, and he <reg orig="conde-|scended">condescended</reg> <lb/>
in his turn, to give me some insight into his own <lb/>
condition. I now discovered that he was sprung from the <lb/>
younger branch of a family, at once ancient and noble. He <lb/>
received an education more befitting his birth than his <reg orig="for-|tune">fortune</reg>; <lb/>
and had, by a thoughtless and dissipated life, wasted <lb/>
his small patrimony. This misfortune had contributed to <lb/>
tame his spirit, to open his eyes on the folly of his past <reg orig="con-|duct">conduct</reg>, <lb/>
and to direct him in the choice of more rational <reg orig="pur-|suits">pursuits</reg>.</p>
<p>He was early distinguished by the favorable regards of a <lb/>
lady of great beauty and accomplishments. This blessing <lb/>
he did not prize as he ought. Though his devotion to Clara <lb/>
Lisle was fervent, he suffered the giddiness of youth, and the <lb/>
fascinations of pleasure, to draw him aside from the path of <lb/>
his true interest. Her regard for him made her overlook <lb/>
many of his foibles, and induced her to try various means to <lb/>
restore him to virtue and discretion. These efforts met <lb/>
with various success, till at length, some flagrant and <reg orig="unex-|pected">unexpected</reg> <lb/>
deviation, contrary to promises, and in defiance of <lb/>
her warnings, caused a breach between them that was <reg orig="irre-|parable">irreparable</reg>.</p>
<p>The head of the nobler branch of Mr. Howard's family <lb/>
was a cousin, a man of excellent, though not of shining <reg orig="cha-|racter">character</reg>. <lb/>
He had long been my friend's competitor for the <lb/>
favor of Miss Lisle. The lady's friends were his strenuous <lb/>
advocates, and used every expedient of argument or authority, <lb/>
to subdue her prepossessions for another. None of these had <lb/>
any influence, while my friend afforded her any hopes of his <lb/>
reformation. His rashness and folly having, at length, <reg orig="ex-|tinguished">extinguished</reg> <lb/>
these hopes, she complied, after much reluctance <lb/>
and delay, with the wishes of her family.</p>
<pb n="41" entity="eaf033v5_0310" pid="uva-lib:350576"/>
<p>This event, communicated by the lady herself in a letter <lb/>
to my friend, in which her motives were candidly stated, <lb/>
and the most pathetic admonitions were employed to point <lb/>
out the errors of his conduct, effected an immediate <reg orig="reform-|ation">reformation</reg>. <lb/>
The blessing which he neglected or slighted, when <lb/>
within his reach, now acquired inestimable value. His <reg orig="re-|grets">regrets</reg> <lb/>
and remorses were very keen, and terminated in a <reg orig="re-|solution">resolution</reg> <lb/>
to convert the wreck of his fortune into an annuity, <lb/>
and retire for the rest of his life to America. This income, <lb/>
though small, was sufficient, economically managed, to <lb/>
maintain him decently, at such a village as Hatfield.</p>
<p>His residence here, at a distance from ancient <reg orig="compan-|ions">companions</reg>, <lb/>
and from all the usual incitements to extravagance, <lb/>
completed, in a few years, a thorough change in his <reg orig="charac-|ter">character</reg>. <lb/>
He became, as I have formerly described him, <reg orig="tempe-|rate">temperate</reg>, <lb/>
studious, gentle, and sedate. The irksomeness of <reg orig="soli-|tude">solitude</reg> <lb/>
was somewhat relieved by his acquaintance with me, <lb/>
and by the efforts which his growing kindness for poor <lb/>
Philip induced him to make for improving and befriending <lb/>
the lad. These efforts he imagined to be crowned with <reg orig="re-|markable">remarkable</reg> <lb/>
success, and gradually concentred all his social <lb/>
feelings in affection for me. He resolved to be a father to <lb/>
me while living, and to leave his few moveables, all he <lb/>
had to leave, to me, at his death.</p>
<p>These prospects were somewhat disturbed by intelligence <lb/>
from home, that his cousin was dead.</p>
<p>Eighteen years absence from his native country, and from <lb/>
Miss Lisle, had greatly strengthened his attachment to his <lb/>
present abode, but had not effaced all the impressions of his <lb/>
youth. The recollection of that lady's charms, her fidelity <lb/>
to him, in spite of the opposition of her family, and of his <lb/>
own demerits, her generous efforts to extricate him from his <lb/>
difficulties, which even proceeded so far, as to pay, indirectly, <lb/>
and through the agency of others, a debt for which he had <lb/>
been arrested, always filled his heart with tenderness and <lb/>
veneration. These thoughts produced habitual seriousness, <lb/>
gratitude to this benefactor, an ardent zeal to fulfil her hopes <lb/>
by the dignity of his future deportment; but was not <reg orig="attend-|ed">attended</reg> <lb/>
with any anger or regret at her compliance with the <reg orig="pru-|dent">prudent</reg> <lb/>
wishes of her family, and her choice of one infinitely <lb/>
more worthy than himself. At this he sincerely rejoiced, <lb/>
<pb n="42" entity="eaf033v5_0311" pid="uva-lib:350577"/>
and felt a pang, at the news of that interruption to her felicity, <lb/>
occasioned by her husband's death.</p>
<p>This event, however, came gradually to be viewed with <lb/>
somewhat different emotions. He began to reflect, that a <lb/>
tenderness so fervent as was once cherished for him, was not <lb/>
likely to be totally extinguished, by any thing but death. <lb/>
His cousin, though a man of worth, had been accepted from <lb/>
the impulse of generosity and pity, and not from that of love. <lb/>
She had been contented, and perhaps happy in her union <lb/>
with him; but, if her first passion was extinct, he imagined <lb/>
there would be found no very great difficulty in reviving it. <lb/>
Both were still in the prime of life, being under thirty eight <lb/>
years of age.</p>
<p>The correspondence so long suspended, was now <reg orig="renew-|ed">renewed</reg> <lb/>
between them; and Mr. Howard, with altered views, <lb/>
and renovated hopes, now embarked for that country which <lb/>
he had believed himself to have for ever abjured. This new <lb/>
state of his affairs by no means lessened his attachment to <lb/>
the fortunate youth, who had been for eight years the sole <lb/>
companion of his retirement; while his own destiny was <reg orig="un-|accomplished">unaccomplished</reg>, <lb/>
he thought it proper to forbear exciting any <lb/>
hopes in me. Should his darling purpose be defeated, he <lb/>
meant immediately to return. Should he meet with success, <lb/>
and his present views, as to the preference due to America, <lb/>
as a place of abode, continued, he meant to exert his <reg orig="influ-|ence">influence</reg> <lb/>
with the elder and younger Clara, for his cousin had <lb/>
left behind him one child, a daughter, now in the bloom of <lb/>
youth, to induce them to emigrate. In every case, however, <lb/>
he was resolved the farmer-boy should not be forgotten.</p>
<p>His projects were crowned, though not immediately, with <lb/>
all the success to be desired. The pair, whom so many <lb/>
years, and so wide an interval had severed, were now united, <lb/>
and the picture which Mr. Howard drew of the American <lb/>
climate and society, obtained his wife's consent to cross the <lb/>
ocean.</p>
<p>"My dear Philip," said Mr. Howard to me, after relating <lb/>
these particulars, "I have a pleasure in this meeting with <lb/>
you, that I cannot describe. You are the son, not of my <reg orig="in-|stincts">instincts</reg>, <lb/>
but of my affections and my reason. Formerly I <lb/>
gave you my advice, my instructions, and company, only <reg orig="be-|cause">because</reg> <lb/>
I had nothing more to give. Now I am rich, and will <lb/>
<pb n="43" entity="eaf033v5_0312" pid="uva-lib:350578"/>
take care that you shall never be again exposed to the <lb/>
chances of poverty. Though opulent, I do not mean to be <lb/>
idle. He that knows the true use of riches, never can be <lb/>
rich enough; but my occupation will leave me leisure enough <lb/>
for enjoyment; and you, who will share my labor, shall <reg orig="par-|take">partake</reg> <lb/>
liberally of the profit. For this end, I mean to admit <lb/>
you as an inseparable member of my family, and to place <lb/>
you, in every respect, on the footing of my son.</p>
<p>"My family consists of my wife and her daughter. The <lb/>
latter is now twenty three, and you will be able to form a <lb/>
just conception of her person and mind, when I tell you, that <lb/>
in both respects, she is exactly what her mother was at her <lb/>
age. There is one particular, indeed, in which the <reg orig="resem-|blance">resemblance</reg> <lb/>
is most striking. She estimates the characters of <lb/>
others, not by the specious but delusive considerations of <lb/>
fortune or birth, but by the intrinsic qualities of heart and <lb/>
head. In her marriage choice, which yet remains to be <lb/>
made, she will forget ancestry and patrimony, and think only <lb/>
of the morals and understanding of the object. Hitherto, <lb/>
her affections have been wholly free, but"&mdash;here Mr. <reg orig="How-|ard">Howard</reg> <lb/>
fixed his eyes with much intenseness and significance, on <lb/>
my countenance&mdash;"her parents will neither be grieved nor <lb/>
surprised, if, after a residence of some time under the same <lb/>
roof with her <hi rend="italic">brother</hi> Philip, she should no longer be able to <lb/>
boast her freedom in that respect. If ever circumstances <lb/>
should arise to put my sincerity to the test, you shall never <lb/>
find me backward to convince you that I practise no <reg orig="equi-|vocations">equivocations</reg> <lb/>
and reserves, and prescribe no limitations or <reg orig="condi-|tions">conditions</reg>, <lb/>
when I grant you the privilege of calling me father.</p>
<p>"My stay with you at present must be short. I am going, <lb/>
on business of importance, to Virginia. I shall call here on <lb/>
my return, which I expect will be soon, and take you with <lb/>
me to New York, where I purpose to reside for some time. <lb/>
The interval may be useful to you, in settling and arranging <lb/>
your little matters, and equipping yourself for your journey."</p>
<p>Such, my friend, was the result of this meeting with Mr. <lb/>
Howard. Every thing connected with this event was so <reg orig="ab-|rupt">abrupt</reg> <lb/>
and unexpected, that my mind was a scene of hurry and <lb/>
confusion, till his departure, next morning, left me at liberty <lb/>
to think on what had past. He left me with marks of the <lb/>
most tender affection, with particular advice in what manner <lb/>
<pb n="44" entity="eaf033v5_0313" pid="uva-lib:350579"/>
to adjust my affairs, and with a promise of acquainting me by <lb/>
letter with all his motions.</p>
<p>I waited with some impatience for Mr. Howard's return. <lb/>
Many things had dropped from him, in our short interview, <lb/>
on which I had now leisure to reflect. His views, with <reg orig="re-|gard">regard</reg> <lb/>
to me, could not fail to delight my youthful fancy. I <lb/>
was dazzled and enchanted by the prospect which he set <reg orig="be-|fore">before</reg> <lb/>
me, of entering on a new and more dignified existence, <lb/>
of partaking the society of beings like Mrs. Howard and her <lb/>
daughter, and of aiding him in the promotion of great and <lb/>
useful purposes.</p>
<p>One intimation, however, had escaped him, which filled <lb/>
me with anxious meditations. The young Clara was the <lb/>
companion of his voyage hither. She had landed on this <lb/>
shore. To her presence and domestic intercourse, I was <lb/>
about to be introduced, and I was allowed to solicit her <lb/>
love. He was willing to bestow her upon me, and had, <lb/>
without doubt, gained the concurrence of her mother in this <lb/>
scheme. It was thus he meant to insure the felicity, and <lb/>
establish the fortune of his pupil.</p>
<p>There is somewhat in the advantages of birth and rank, <lb/>
in the habit of viewing objects through the medium of books, <lb/>
that gives a sacred obscurity, a mysterious elevation, to <lb/>
human beings. I had been familiar with the names nobility <lb/>
and royality, but the things themselves had ever been <reg orig="shroud-|ed">shrouded</reg> <lb/>
in an awe creating darkness. Their distance had likewise <lb/>
produced an interval, which I imagined impossible for me to <lb/>
overpass. They were objects to be viewed, like the <reg orig="Divini-|ty">Divinity</reg>, <lb/>
from afar. The only sentiments which they could excite, <lb/>
were reverence and wonder. That I should ever pass the <lb/>
mound which separated my residence and my condition from <lb/>
theirs, was utterly incredible.</p>
<p>The ideas annexed to the term <hi rend="italic">peasant</hi> are wholly <reg orig="inap-|plicable">inapplicable</reg> <lb/>
to the tillers of ground in America; but our notions <lb/>
are the offspring more of the books we read, than of any other <lb/>
of our external circumstances. Our books are almost wholly <lb/>
the productions of Europe, and the prejudices which infect <lb/>
us are derived chiefly from this source. These prejudices <lb/>
may be somewhat rectified by age, and by converse with the <lb/>
world, but they flourish in full vigor in youthful minds, reared <lb/>
in seclusion and privacy, and undisciplined by intercourse <lb/>
<pb n="45" entity="eaf033v5_0314" pid="uva-lib:350580"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">5</fw></pb>
with various classes of mankind. In me, they possessed an <lb/>
unusual degree of strength. My words were selected and <lb/>
defined according to foreign usages, and my notions of dignity <lb/>
were modelled on a scale, which the <hi rend="italic">revolution</hi> has <reg orig="complete-|ly">completely</reg> <lb/>
taken away. I could never forget that my condition was <lb/>
that of a <hi rend="italic">peasant,</hi> and in spite of reflection, I was the slave <lb/>
of those sentiments of self contempt and humiliation, which <lb/>
pertain to that condition elsewhere, through chimerical and <lb/>
visionary on the western side of the Atlantic.</p>
<p>My ambition of dignity and fortune grew out of this <reg orig="sup-|posed">supposed</reg> <lb/>
inferiority of rank. Experience had taught me, how <lb/>
slender are the genuine wants of a human being, and made <lb/>
me estimate, at their true value, the blessings of competence, <lb/>
and fixed property. Our fears are always proportioned to <lb/>
our hopes, and what is ardently desired, appears, when <lb/>
placed within our reach, to be an illusion designed to <reg orig="tor-|ment">torment</reg> <lb/>
us. We are inclined to question the reality of that <lb/>
which our foresight had never suggested as near, though <lb/>
our wishes had perpetually hovered around it.</p>
<p>When the death of Wilmot put his sister in possession of <lb/>
a sum of money, which, when converted into land, would <lb/>
procure her and the man whom her affection had <reg orig="distin-|guished">distinguished</reg>, <lb/>
a domain of four or five hundred fertile acres, my <lb/>
emotions I cannot describe. Many would be less affected <lb/>
in passing from a fisherman's hovel to the throne of an <reg orig="opu-|lent">opulent</reg> <lb/>
nation. It so much surpassed the ordinary bounds of <lb/>
my foresight and even of my wishes, that, for a time, I was <lb/>
fain to think myself in one of my usual walking dreams. <lb/>
My doubts were dispelled only by the repetition of the same <lb/>
impressions, and by the lapse of time. I gradually became <lb/>
familiarized to the change, and by frequently revolving its <lb/>
benefits and consequences, raised the tenor of my ordinary <lb/>
sensations to the level, as it were, of my new condition.</p>
<p>From this unwonted height, Morton's reappearance had <lb/>
thrown us down to our original obscurity. But now my <lb/>
old preceptor had started up before me, and, like my good <lb/>
genius, had brought with him gifts immeasurable, and <reg orig="sur-|passing">surpassing</reg> <lb/>
belief. They existed till now, in another hemisphere; <lb/>
they occupied an elevation in the social scale, to which I <lb/>
could scarcely raise my eyes; yet they were now within a <lb/>
<pb n="46" entity="eaf033v5_0315" pid="uva-lib:350581"/>
short journey of my dwelling. I was going to be ushered <lb/>
into their presence; but my privilege was not to be <reg orig="circum-|scribed">circumscribed</reg> <lb/>
by any sober limits. This heiress of opulence and <lb/>
splendor, this child of fortune, and appropriator of elegance <lb/>
and grace, and beauty, was proffered to me as a wife!</p>
<p>I reflected on the education which I had received from <lb/>
Mr. Howard; his affection for me, which had been <reg orig="un-|limited">unlimited</reg>; <lb/>
his relation to his wife's daughter, and the <reg orig="autho-|rity">authority</reg> <lb/>
and respect which that relation, as well as his personal <lb/>
qualities, produced. I reflected on the futility of titular <lb/>
distinction; on the capriciousness of wealth, and its <reg orig="inde-|pendence">independence</reg> <lb/>
of all real merit, in the possessor; but still I <lb/>
could not retain but for a moment, the confidence and self <lb/>
respect which flowed from these thoughts. I was still <reg orig="noth-|ing">nothing</reg> <lb/>
more than an obscure clown, whose life had been spent <lb/>
in the barnyard and cornfield, and to whose level, it was <lb/>
impossible for a being, qualified and educated like Clara, <lb/>
ever to descend.</p>
<p>You must not imagine, however, that this descent was <lb/>
desired by me. I was bound, by every tie of honor, though <lb/>
not of affection, to Mary Wilmot. Incited by compassion <lb/>
and by gratitude, I had plighted my vows to her, and had <lb/>
formed no wish or expectation of revoking them. These <lb/>
vows were to be completed in a few months, by marriage; <lb/>
but this event, by the unfortunate, though seasonable and <lb/>
equitable claim of Morton, was placed at an uncertain <reg orig="dis-|tance">distance</reg>. <lb/>
Marriage, while both of us were poor, would be an <lb/>
act of the utmost indiscretion.</p>
<p>What, however, was taken away by Morton, might, I <lb/>
fondly conceived, be restored to us by the generosity of Mr. <lb/>
Howard. It was not, indeed, perfectly agreeable to the <reg orig="dic-|tates">dictates</reg> <lb/>
of my pride, to receive fortune as the boon of any one; <lb/>
but I had always been accustomed to regard Mr. Howard <lb/>
more as my father than teacher, and it seemed as if I had <lb/>
a natural right to every gift which was needful to my <reg orig="happi-|ness">happiness</reg>, <lb/>
and which was in his power to bestow.</p>
<p>Mary and her claims on me, were, indeed, unknown to <lb/>
my friend. He had no reason to be particularly interested <lb/>
in her fate; and her claims interfered with those schemes <lb/>
which he had apparently formed, with relation to Clara and <lb/>
myself. How, I asked, might he regard her claims? In <lb/>
<pb n="47" entity="eaf033v5_0316" pid="uva-lib:350582"/>
what light would he consider that engagement of the <reg orig="under-|standing">understanding</reg>, <lb/>
rather than of the heart, into which I had entered? <lb/>
How far would he esteem it proper to adhere to it; and <lb/>
what efforts might he make to dissolve it?</p>
<p>Various incidents had hindered me from thoroughly <reg orig="ex-|plaining">explaining</reg> <lb/>
to him my situation, during his short stay at Hatfield; <lb/>
but I resolved to seize the opportunity of our next meeting, <lb/>
and by a frank disclosure, to put an end to all my doubts. <lb/>
Meanwhile, I employed the interval of his absence, in <reg orig="giv-|ing">giving</reg> <lb/>
an account of all these events to Mary, and impatiently <lb/>
waited the arrival of a letter. The period of my friend's <lb/>
absence was nearly expired, and the hourly expectation of <lb/>
his return prevented me from visiting Mary in person. <reg orig="In-|stead">Instead</reg> <lb/>
of his coming, however, I at length received a letter <lb/>
from him in these terms.</p>

<p>Being, by this letter, relieved from the necessity of staying <lb/>
longer at Hatfield, I prepared to visit my friend at Abingdon. <lb/>
Some six or seven days had elapsed since my messenger <lb/>
had left with her my last letter, and I had not since heard <lb/>
from her. I had been enjoined to repair to New York with <lb/>
expedition, but I could not omit the present occasion of an <lb/>
interview with Mary. Morton's claim would produce an <lb/>
essential change in her condition, and I was desirous of <lb/>
discussing with her the validity of this claim, and the <reg orig="conse-|quences">consequences</reg> <lb/>
of admitting it.</p>
<pb n="48" entity="eaf033v5_0317" pid="uva-lib:350583"/>
<p>I had not seen Morton since his first visit. I now, in my <lb/>
way to Abingdon, called at his father's house.</p>
<p>The old man appeared at the door.</p>
<p>His son had visited and staid with him a few days, but <lb/>
liad afterwards returned to the city. He had gone thither <lb/>
to settle some affairs, and had promised to come back in a <lb/>
few weeks. He knew not in what affairs he was engaged&mdash; <lb/>
could not tell how far he had succeeded, or whereabouts in <lb/>
the city he resided.</p>
<p>I proceeded to Abingdon, not without some expectation <lb/>
of Morton's having already accomplished his wishes, and <lb/>
persuaded my friend to refund the money; and yet, in a <lb/>
case of such importance, I could not easily believe that my <lb/>
concurrence, or at least my advice, would be dispensed with.</p>
<p>I went to her lodgings as soon as I arrived. I had <reg orig="pro-|cured">procured</reg> <lb/>
her a pleasant abode, at the house of a lady who was <lb/>
nearly allied to my uncle, and where the benefits of decent <lb/>
and affectionate society could be enjoyed without leaving her <lb/>
apartments. Mrs. Bordley was apprized of the connexion <lb/>
which subsisted between her inmate and me, and had <reg orig="con-|tracted">contracted</reg> <lb/>
and expressed much affection for her guest. On <lb/>
inquiring for Miss Wilmot of her hostess, she betrayed some <lb/>
surprise.</p>
<p>"Mary Wilmot?" she answered; "that is a strange <reg orig="ques-|tion">question</reg> <lb/>
from you; surely you know she is not here."</p>
<p>"Not here!" cried I, somewhat startled; "what has <lb/>
become of her?"</p>
<p>"You do not know then that she has left us for good and <lb/>
all?"</p>
<p>"No, indeed; not a syllable of any such design has <lb/>
reached me; but wither has she gone?"</p>
<p>"That is more than I can say. If you are uninformed <lb/>
on that head, it cannot be expected that I should be in the <lb/>
secret. I only know, that three days ago she told me of her <lb/>
intention to change her lodgings, and she did so accordingly, <lb/>
yesterday morning at sunrise."</p>
<p>"But what was her motive? What cause of dislike did <lb/>
she express to this house? I expected she would remain <lb/>
here, till she changed it for a house of her own."</p>
<p>"Why indeed, that may be actually the case now, for she <lb/>
went away with a very spruce young gentleman, in his <lb/>
<pb n="49" entity="eaf033v5_0318" pid="uva-lib:350584"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">5*</fw></pb>
chaise. But that cannot be. Poor creature! She was in <lb/>
no state for so joyous a thing as matrimony. She was very <lb/>
feeble; nay, she was quite ill; she had scarcely left her <lb/>
bed during five days before, and with difficulty got out of it, <lb/>
and dressed herself, when the chaise called for her. She <lb/>
would eat nothing, notwithstanding all my persuasion, and <lb/>
the pains I took to prepare some light nice thing, such as a <lb/>
weak stomach could bear. When she told me she meant <lb/>
to leave my house, I was as much surprised as you, and <reg orig="in-|quired">inquired</reg> <lb/>
what had offended or displeased her in my behaviour. <lb/>
She assured me that she had been entirely satisfied, and that <lb/>
her motives for leaving me had no connexion with my <reg orig="deport-|ment">deportment</reg>. <lb/>
There was a necessity for going, though she could <lb/>
not explain to me what it was. I ventured to ask where she <lb/>
designed to go, but she avoided answering me for some time; <lb/>
and when I repeated the question, she said she could not <lb/>
describe her new lodgings&mdash;she knew not in what spot she <lb/>
was destined to take up her rest&mdash;and confessed that there <lb/>
were the most cogent reasons for her silence on that head. <lb/>
I mentioned the coldness of the weather, and her own ill <lb/>
health; but she answered, that no option had been left her, <lb/>
and that she must go, if it were even necessary to carry her <lb/>
from her bed to the carriage. All this, as you may well <lb/>
suppose, was strange; and I renewed my questions and <lb/>
entreaties, but she gave me no satisfaction, and persisted <lb/>
in her resolutions. Accordingly, on Thursday morning, a <lb/>
chaise stopped at the door, took her in, with a small trunk, <lb/>
and hastened away."</p>
<p>I was confounded and perplexed at this tale. No event <lb/>
was less expected than this. No intimation had even been <lb/>
dropped by Mary, that created the least suspicion of this <lb/>
design. She had left, as Mrs. Bordley proceeded to inform <lb/>
me, all her furniture, without direction to whom, or in <lb/>
what manner to dispose of it, and yet had said that she <lb/>
never designed to return. The gentleman with whom she <lb/>
departed was unknown to Mrs. Bordley, and had stopt so <lb/>
short a time, as not to suffer her to obtain, by remarks or <lb/>
interrogatories, any gratification of her curiosity.</p>
<p>Having ineffectually put a score of questions to Mrs. <reg orig="Bord-|ley">Bordley</reg>, <lb/>
I entered the deserted apartments. The keys of closets <lb/>
<pb n="50" entity="eaf033v5_0319" pid="uva-lib:350585"/>
and drawers no where appeared, though the furniture was <lb/>
arranged as usual. Inquiring of my companion for these&mdash;</p>
<p>"Aye," said she, "I had almost forgotten. The last <lb/>
thing she said before the chair left the door, holding out a <lb/>
bunch of keys to me, was, `Give these to&mdash;' there her voice <lb/>
faltered, and I observed the tears flow. I received the <lb/>
keys, and though she went away without ending her <reg orig="sen-|tence">sentence</reg>, <lb/>
I took for granted it was you she meant."</p>
<p>I eageily seized the keys, and hoped, by their assistance, <lb/>
to find a clue to this labyrinth. I opened the closets and <lb/>
drawers and turned over their contents, but found no paper <lb/>
which would give me the intelligence I wanted. No script <lb/>
of any kind appeared; nothing but a few sheets, and the <lb/>
like cumbrous furniture. A writing desk stood near the <lb/>
wall, but blank paper, wafers, and quills, were all that it <lb/>
contained. I desisted, at length, from my unprofitable <lb/>
labor, and once more renewed my inquiries of Mrs. <reg orig="Bord-|ley">Bordley</reg>.</p>
<p>She described the dress and form of the young man who <lb/>
attended the fugitive. I could not at first recognize in her <lb/>
description any one whom I knew. His appearance bespoke <lb/>
him to be a citizen, and he seemed to have arrived from the <lb/>
city, as well as to return thither. She dwelt with <reg orig="particu-|lar">particular</reg> <lb/>
emphasis on the graces of the youth, and frequently <lb/>
insinuated that a new gallant had supplanted the old.</p>
<p>For some time, I was deaf to these surmises; but, at <lb/>
length, they insensibly revived in my fancy, and acquired <lb/>
strength. I began to account for appearances so as to <reg orig="jus-|tify">justify</reg> <lb/>
my suspicion. She had not informed me of her <reg orig="mo-|tions">motions</reg>; <lb/>
but that might arise from compunction and shame. <lb/>
There might even be something illicit in this new connexion, <lb/>
to which necessity might have impelled her. The claims of <lb/>
Morton were made known to her by me, but possibly they <lb/>
had been previously imparted by himself. To shun that <lb/>
poverty to which this discovery would again reduce her, she <lb/>
listened to the offers of one, whose opulence was able to <lb/>
relieve her wants.</p>
<p>The notion that her conduct was culpable, vanished in a <lb/>
moment, and I abhorred myself for harboring it. I <reg orig="re-|membered">remembered</reg> <lb/>
all the proofs of a pure and exalted mind, <reg orig="impa-|tient">impatient</reg> <lb/>
of contempt and poverty, but shrinking with infinitely <lb/>
<pb n="51" entity="eaf033v5_0320" pid="uva-lib:350586"/>
more reluctance from vice and turpitude, which she had <lb/>
given. I called to mind her treatment of a man, by name <lb/>
Sedley, who had formerly solicited her love, and this <reg orig="re-|membrance">remembrance</reg> <lb/>
gave birth to a new conjecture, which <reg orig="subse-|quent">subsequent</reg> <lb/>
reflection only tended to confirm.</p>
<p>Sedley had contracted a passion for Mary six or eight <lb/>
years ago. He was a man of excellent morals, and heir to <lb/>
a great fortune. He had patrimony in his own possession, and <lb/>
had much to hope for from his parents. These parents <lb/>
hated and reviled the object of their son's affections, merely <lb/>
because she was poor, and their happiness seemed to <reg orig="de-|pend">depend</reg> <lb/>
on his renouncing her. To this he would never <reg orig="con-|sent">consent</reg>, <lb/>
and Mary might long ago have removed all the evils <lb/>
of her situation, had she been willing to accept Sedley's <lb/>
offers; but though she had the highest esteem for his virtues, <lb/>
and gratitude for his preference, her heart was another's. <lb/>
Besides, her notions of duty were unusually scrupulous. <lb/>
Her poverty had only made her more watchful against any <lb/>
encroachments on her dignity, and she disdained to enter a <lb/>
family, who thought themselves degraded by her alliance.</p>
<p>Sedley was a vehement spirit. Opposition whetted, <reg orig="rath-|er">rather</reg> <lb/>
than blunted his zeal; and Mary's conduct, while it <lb/>
heightened his admiration and respect, gave new edge to <lb/>
his desires. The youth, whom she loved, did not admit a <lb/>
mutual affection, and his poverty would have set marriage at <lb/>
a hopeless distance, even if it had been conceived. <reg orig="Sed-|ley">Sedley</reg>, <lb/>
therefore, believed himself the only one capable of <lb/>
truly promoting her happiness, and persisted in courting her <lb/>
favor longer and with more constancy, than might have been <lb/>
expected from his ardent feelings and versatile age.</p>
<p>I need not repeat that Mary's affections were mine. To <lb/>
Sedley, therefore, I was the object of aversion and fear, and <lb/>
there never took place between us intercourse sufficient <lb/>
to subdue his prejudices. After her brother's death, <reg orig="mar-|riage">marriage</reg> <lb/>
was resolved upon between us, and Sedley slackened <lb/>
the ardor of his pursuit. Still, however, he would not <reg orig="ab-|jure">abjure</reg> <lb/>
her society.</p>
<p>Some secret revolution, perhaps, had been wrought in the <lb/>
mind of my friend. Her consent to marriage had been <lb/>
extorted by me, for she was almost equally averse to <reg orig="mar-|riage">marriage</reg> <lb/>
with one by whom she was not loved with that warmth <lb/>
<pb n="52" entity="eaf033v5_0321" pid="uva-lib:350587"/>
which she thought her due, as with one who possessed every <lb/>
title to preference but her love. These scruples had been <lb/>
laid aside, in consideration of the benefit which her brother's <lb/>
death, by giving her property, enabled her to confer upon <lb/>
me, who was destitute. This benefit it was no longer in <lb/>
her power to confer. She would consider herself as <reg orig="sever-|ed">severed</reg> <lb/>
from me for ever, and in this state a renewal of Sedley's <lb/>
importunities might subdue her reluctance. On comparing <lb/>
Mrs. Bordley's description of the voice, features, garb, and <lb/>
carriage of Mary's attendant, with those of Sedley, I <reg orig="fan-|cied">fancied</reg> <lb/>
I discovered a strong resemblance between them. Some <lb/>
other coincidences, which came to light in the course of the <lb/>
day, made me certain as to the person of her companion. <lb/>
It was Sedley himself.</p>
<p>I was willing to gain all the knowledge of this affair which <lb/>
was within my reach. Sedley's usual place of abode was <lb/>
his father's house in Virginia, but he chiefly passed his time <lb/>
in Philadelphia, where he resided with his sister, who was a <lb/>
lady of great merit, and left, by her husband's death, in <reg orig="opu-|lent">opulent</reg> <lb/>
circumstances. This lady had made frequent overtures <lb/>
of friendship to Mary, but these had, for the most part, been <lb/>
declined. This reserve was not wholly free from pride. <lb/>
A mistaken sensibility made her shun those occasions for <lb/>
contempt or insult, which might occur in her intercourse <lb/>
with the rich. The relation in which she stood to Sedley <lb/>
was another impediment. A just regard for his happiness <lb/>
compelled her to exclude herself as much as possible from <lb/>
his company. The kindness of Mrs. Valentine had not <lb/>
been diverted by these scruples and reserves, and some <reg orig="in-|tercourse">intercourse</reg> <lb/>
had taken place between them before Mary's <reg orig="re-|tirement">retirement</reg> <lb/>
to Abingdon.</p>
<p>This change of views in my friend had given me much <lb/>
disquiet, but some reflection convinced me that it was a <lb/>
cause of rejoicing rather than regret. Wedlock had been <lb/>
desired by me, more from zeal for the happiness of another, <lb/>
than for my own. I had lamented that destiny which made <lb/>
the affections of three persons merely the instruments of <lb/>
their misery, and had exerted my influence to give a new <lb/>
direction to my friend's passions. This undertaking was no <lb/>
less delicate than arduous, and no wonder, that in hands so <lb/>
unskilful as mine, the attempt should fail. I could not be <lb/>
<pb n="53" entity="eaf033v5_0322" pid="uva-lib:350588"/>
much displeased that this end was effected, though I was <lb/>
somewhat mortified on finding that she did not deem me <lb/>
worthy of being apprized of her schemes. I reflected, <reg orig="how-|ever">however</reg>, <lb/>
that this information might only be delayed; and <reg orig="im-|agined">imagined</reg> <lb/>
a thousand plausible reasons which might induce her <lb/>
to postpone intelligence so unexpected, if not disagreeable <lb/>
to me.</p>
<p>Next morning I repaired to the city, and to Mrs. <reg orig="Valen-|tine's">Valentine's</reg> <lb/>
house. I inquired of a female servant for Miss <reg orig="Wil-|mot">Wilmot</reg>, <lb/>
but was told that she had been there, a few hours, on <lb/>
the preceding Thursday, and had then gone, in company <lb/>
with her mistress and Mr. Sedley, to New York. No time <lb/>
had been fixed for their return, but Mrs. Valentine had said <lb/>
that her absence might last for six or eight months. The <lb/>
steward, who might afford me more information, was out of <lb/>
town.</p>
<p>Thus my conjectures were confirmed; and having no <lb/>
reason for further delay, I immediately set out in the same <lb/>
road. My thoughts, disembarrassed from all engagements <lb/>
with Mary, persuaded of her union with Sedley, and <reg orig="con-|vinced">convinced</reg> <lb/>
that this union would more promote her happiness <lb/>
than any other event, I returned without reluctance to Clara <lb/>
Howard. I was impatient to compare those vague and <reg orig="glit-|tering">glittering</reg> <lb/>
conceptions which hovered in my fancy, with the <lb/>
truth; therefore adopted the swiftest conveyance, and <reg orig="arriv-|ed">arrived</reg>, <lb/>
in the evening of the same day, at Powle's Hook ferry.</p>
<p>My excursions had hitherto been short and rare, and the <lb/>
stage on which I was now entering, abounded with novelty <lb/>
and grandeur. The second city in our country was <reg orig="fa-|miliar">familiar</reg> <lb/>
to my fancy by description; but my ideas were <reg orig="dis-|jointed">disjointed</reg> <lb/>
and crude, and my attention was busy in searching, <lb/>
in the objects that presented themselves, for similitudes <lb/>
which were seldom to be met with. A sort of tremulous, <lb/>
but pleasing astonishment, overwhelmed me, while I gazed <lb/>
through the twilight, on the river and the city on the further <lb/>
shore. My sensations of solemn and glowing expectation <lb/>
chiefly flowed from the foresight of the circumstances in <lb/>
which I was preparing to place myself.</p>
<p>Men exist more for the future than the present. Our <lb/>
being is never so intense and vivid, if I may so speak, as <lb/>
when we are on the eye of some anticipated revolution, <reg orig="mo-|mentous">momentous</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="54" entity="eaf033v5_0323" pid="uva-lib:350589"/>
to our happiness. Our attention is attracted by <lb/>
every incident that brings us nearer to the change, and we <lb/>
are busy in marking the agreement between objects as they <lb/>
rise before us, and our previous imaginations. Thus it was <lb/>
with me. My palpitations increased as I drew near the <lb/>
house to which I had been directed, and I could scarcely <lb/>
govern my emotions sufficiently to inquire of the servant <lb/>
who appeared to my summons, for Mrs. Howard.</p>
<p>I was ushered into a lighted parlor, and presently a lady <lb/>
entered. She bore no marks of having passed the middle <lb/>
age, and her countenance exhibited the union of fortitude <lb/>
and sweetness. Her air was full of dignity and <reg orig="condescen-|sion">condescension</reg>. <lb/>
Methought I wanted no other assurance but that <lb/>
which the sight of her conveyed, that this was the wife of <lb/>
my friend.</p>
<p>I was thrown, by her entrance, into some confusion, and <lb/>
was at a loss in what manner to announce myself. The <lb/>
moment she caught a distinct glance of my figure, her <reg orig="fea-|tures">features</reg> <lb/>
expanded into a smile, and offering her hand, she <reg orig="ex-|claimed&mdash;">exclaimed&mdash;</reg></p>
<p>"Ahah! This, without doubt, is the young friend, whom <lb/>
we have so anxiously looked for. Your name is Philip <lb/>
Stanley, and as such I welcome you, with the tenderness of <lb/>
a mother, to this home."&mdash;Turning to a servant who <reg orig="follow-|ed">followed</reg> <lb/>
her, she continued, "Call Clara hither. Tell her that <lb/>
a friend has arrived."</p>
<p>Before I had time to comment on this abrupt reception, <lb/>
the door was again opened. A nymph, robed with the <lb/>
most graceful simplicity, entered, and advancing towards <lb/>
me, offered me her hand.</p>
<p>"Here," said the elder lady, "is the son and brother, <lb/>
whom Mr. Howard promised to procure for us. Welcome <lb/>
him, my girl, as such."</p>
<p>Lifting her eyes from the floor, and casting on me <reg orig="bash-|ful">bashful</reg> <lb/>
but affectionate looks, the young lady said, in a half <lb/>
whisper, "He is truly welcome"&mdash;and again offered the <lb/>
hand which, confounded and embarrassed as I at first was, <lb/>
I had declined to accept. Now, however, I was less <reg orig="back-|ward">backward</reg>.</p>
<p>An unaffected and sprightly conversation followed, that <lb/>
tended to banish those timidities which were too <reg orig="appa-|rent">apparent</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="55" entity="eaf033v5_0324" pid="uva-lib:350590"/>
in my deportment. Mrs. Howard entered into a gay <lb/>
and almost humorous description of my person, such as she <lb/>
had received before my arrival, and remarked the <reg orig="differ-|ences">differences</reg> <lb/>
between the picture and the original, intermingling <lb/>
questions, which, compelling me to open my lips in answer <lb/>
to them, helped me to get rid of my awkwardness. <reg orig="Pre-|sently">Presently</reg> <lb/>
supper was prepared, and despatched with the utmost <lb/>
cheerfulness.</p>
<p>My astonishment and rapture were unspeakable. Such <lb/>
condescension and familiarity, surpassing all my fondest <reg orig="ima-|ginations">imaginations</reg>, <lb/>
from beings invested with such dazzling superiority, <lb/>
almost intoxicated my senses. My answers were <reg orig="disadvan-|tageous">disadvantageous</reg> <lb/>
to myself, for they were made in such a tumult and <lb/>
delirium of emotions, that they could not fail of being <reg orig="inco-|herent">incoherent</reg> <lb/>
or silly.</p>
<p>Gradually these raptures subsided, and I acted and spoke <lb/>
with more sobriety and confidence. I had leisure also to <lb/>
survey the features of my friends. Seated at opposite sides <lb/>
of the table, with lights above and around us, every <reg orig="linea-|ment">lineament</reg> <lb/>
and gesture were distinctly seen. It was difficult to <lb/>
say which person was the most lovely. The bloom and <lb/>
glossiness of youth had, indeed, disappeared in the elder, <lb/>
but the ruddy tints and the smoothness of health, joined to <lb/>
the most pathetic and intelligent expression, set the mother <lb/>
on a level, even in personal attractions, with the daughter. <lb/>
No music was ever more thrilling than the tones of Clara. <lb/>
They sunk deeply into my heart, while her eyes, casually <lb/>
turned on me, and beaming with complacency, contributed <lb/>
still more to enchant me.</p>
<p>In a few days, the effects of novelty gradually <reg orig="disappear-|ing">disappearing</reg>, <lb/>
I began to find myself at home. Mr. Howard's arrival, <lb/>
and the cordiality of his behavior, contributed still more to <lb/>
place me at ease. Those employments he designed for me <lb/>
now occurred. They generally engrossed the half of each <lb/>
day. They were light, despatched without toil or anxiety, <lb/>
and conduced, in innumerable ways, to my pleasure and <lb/>
improvement. They introduced me to men of different <lb/>
professions and characters, called forth my ingenuity and <lb/>
knowledge, and supplied powerful incitements to new studies <lb/>
and inquiries.</p>
<p>At noon, the day's business was usually dismissed, and <lb/>
<pb n="56" entity="eaf033v5_0325" pid="uva-lib:350591"/>
the afternoon and evening were devoted to intellectual and <lb/>
social occupations. These were generally partaken by the <lb/>
ladies, and visits were received and paid so rarely, as to <lb/>
form no interruption to domestic pleasures. Collected around <lb/>
the fire, and busied in music, or books, or discourse, the <lb/>
hours flew away with unheeded rapidity. The contrast <lb/>
which this scene bore to my past life perpetually recurred to <lb/>
my reflections, and added new and inexpressible charms to <lb/>
that security and elegance by which I was at present <reg orig="sur-|rounded">surrounded</reg>.</p>
<p>Clara was the companion of my serious and my sportive <lb/>
hours. I found, in her character, simplicity and tenderness, <lb/>
united to powerful intellects. The name of children was <lb/>
often conferred upon us by my friend and his wife; all <lb/>
advances to familiarity and confidence between us were <lb/>
encouraged; our little plans of walking or studying together <lb/>
were sanctioned by smiles of approbation; and their <reg orig="happi-|ness">happiness</reg> <lb/>
was evidently imperfect while ours was suspended or <lb/>
postponed.</p>
<p>In this intercourse there was nothing to hinder the growth <lb/>
of that sentiment, which is so congenial with virtuous and <lb/>
youthful bosoms. My chief delight was in sharing the <lb/>
society and performing offices of kindness for Clara; and <lb/>
this delight the frankness of her nature readily shewed to be <lb/>
mutual. Love was not avowed or solicited, and did not <lb/>
frequently recur, in an undisguised shape, to my thoughts. <lb/>
My desires seemed to be limited to her presence, and to <lb/>
participating her occupations and amusements. Satisfied in <lb/>
like manner with this, no marks of impatience or anxiety <lb/>
were ever betrayed by her, but in my absence.</p>
<p>The fulness of content which I now experienced did not <lb/>
totally exclude the remembrance of Mary. I had heard <lb/>
and seen nothing of Morton since my departure from <reg orig="Hat-|field">Hatfield</reg>. <lb/>
The only way of accounting for this, was to suppose <lb/>
that Mary and he had met, and that the former, persuaded <lb/>
of the equity of his claim, had resigned to him the money <lb/>
which he had remitted to her brother.</p>
<p>The silence which she had observed, involved me in the <lb/>
deepest perplexity. I spared no pains to discover Mrs. <reg orig="Va-|lentine's">Valentine's</reg> <lb/>
residence, but my pains were fruitless. My <reg orig="inqui-|ries">inquiries</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="57" entity="eaf033v5_0326" pid="uva-lib:350592"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">6</fw></pb>
rendered it certain that, at least, no such person resided <lb/>
in New York.</p>
<p>Thus occupied, the winter passed away. On a mild, but <lb/>
blustering evening in March, I happened to be walking, in <lb/>
company with Clara, on the battery. I chanced, after some <lb/>
time, to spy before me, coming in an opposite direction, the <lb/>
man whose fate had engaged so much of my attention. It <lb/>
was Morton himself. On seeing me, he betrayed much <lb/>
satisfaction, but no surprise. We greeted each other <reg orig="affec-|tionately">affectionately</reg>. <lb/>
Observing that he eyed my companion with <reg orig="par-|ticular">particular</reg> <lb/>
earnestness, I introduced him to her.</p>
<p>This meeting was highly desirable, as I hoped to collect <lb/>
from it an explication of what had hitherto been a source of <lb/>
perplexity. I likewise marked a cheerfulness in my friend's <lb/>
deportment, which shewed that some favorable change had <lb/>
taken place. He seemed no less anxious than I for a <reg orig="con-|fidential">confidential</reg> <lb/>
interview; and an appointment of a meeting on the <lb/>
same evening was accordingly made.</p>
<p>Having conducted Clara home, I hastened to the place <lb/>
appointed. I was forthwith ushered into a parlor, where <lb/>
Morton was found in company with a lady of graceful and <lb/>
pensive mien, with a smiling babe in her arms, to whom he <lb/>
introduced me as to his wife. This incident confirmed my <lb/>
favorable prognostics, and I waited, with impatience, till the <lb/>
lady's departure removed all constraint from our <reg orig="conversa-|tion">conversation</reg>.</p>
<p>In a short time she left us alone. "I congratulate you," <lb/>
said I, "on your reunion with your family, but cannot help <lb/>
expressing my surprise that you never favored me with a <lb/>
second visit, or gave me any intelligence of your good <reg orig="for-|tune">fortune</reg>."</p>
<p>He apologized for his neglect, by saying, that the arrival <lb/>
of his wife and daughter, in New York, obliged him, shortly <lb/>
after our interview, to hasten to this city, where successive <lb/>
engagements had detained him till now. He was, <reg orig="neverthe-|less">nevertheless</reg>, <lb/>
extremely desirous of a meeting, and intended, as soon <lb/>
as pleasant weather should return, to go to Hatfield, on <reg orig="pur-|pose">purpose</reg> <lb/>
to see me. This meeting, however, had fortunately <lb/>
occurred to preclude the necessity of that journey. He <lb/>
then inquired into the health of Miss Wilmot, and her <reg orig="pre-|sent">present</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="58" entity="eaf033v5_0327" pid="uva-lib:350593"/>
situation. "I was anxious to see her," he continued, <lb/>
"on account of that affair, on which we conversed at our <lb/>
last meeting. As her brother's friend, I was, likewise, <reg orig="de-|sirous">desirous</reg> <lb/>
of seeing her, and tendering her any service in my <lb/>
power, but when taking measures to bring about an <reg orig="inter-|view">interview</reg>, <lb/>
I received a letter from my wife, who, to my infinite <lb/>
surprise and satisfaction, had embarked for America, and <lb/>
arrived safely at New York. My eagerness to see my <lb/>
family made me postpone this interview for the present, and <lb/>
one engagement has since so rapidly succeeded another, <lb/>
that I have never been at leisure to execute this design."</p>
<p>"What," said I, "has no meeting taken place between <lb/>
Mary Wilmot and you? Has she not restored the money <lb/>
you claimed?"</p>
<p>"Surely," replied he, "you cannot be ignorant that I <lb/>
have never received it. I doubted whether I ought to <reg orig="re-|ceive">receive</reg> <lb/>
it, even if my title were good. It was chiefly to <reg orig="be-|come">become</reg> <lb/>
acquainted with her, that I looked for her, and my good <lb/>
fortune has since enabled me to dispense with any thing <lb/>
else. The property, left by her brother, may rightfully <lb/>
belong to her, notwithstanding present appearances. At <lb/>
any rate, her possessions shall be unmolested by me."</p>
<p>He then proceeded to inform me, that his wife's parents <lb/>
being deceived by his long silence, and the intelligence of <lb/>
his shipwreck, into the opinion of his death, had relented, <lb/>
and settled an independent and liberal pension on their <lb/>
daughter, on condition of her choosing some abode at a <reg orig="dis-|tance">distance</reg> <lb/>
from them. She proposed to retire, with her child, to <lb/>
some neat and rural abode in Cornwall, and was on the point <lb/>
of executing this design, when letters were received from <lb/>
her husband, at Algiers, which assured her of his safety, and <lb/>
requested her to embark for America, where it was his <reg orig="in-|tention">intention</reg> <lb/>
to meet her. She had instantly changed her plans, <lb/>
and selling her annuity on good terms, had transported <reg orig="her-|self">herself</reg> <lb/>
and her property to New York, where her husband <lb/>
being apprized of her arrival, hastened to join her.</p>
<p>"Thus," continued Morton, "you have, in my destiny, a <lb/>
striking instance of the folly of despair. My shipwreck, <lb/>
and my long absence, in circumstances which hindered all <lb/>
intercourse between me and my family, were the most <reg orig="pro-|pitious">propitious</reg> <lb/>
events that could have happened. Nothing but the <lb/>
<pb n="59" entity="eaf033v5_0328" pid="uva-lib:350594"/>
belief of my death, and the consequent distresses of my wife, <lb/>
could have softened the animosity of her parents. Her <reg orig="dis-|obedience">disobedience</reg>, <lb/>
they thought, had been amply punished, and fate <lb/>
having taken from me the power of receiving any advantage <lb/>
from their gift, they consented to make her future life secure, <lb/>
at least, from want.</p>
<p>"It was also lucky, that their returning affection stopped <lb/>
just where it did. Their resentment was still so powerful as <lb/>
to make them refuse to see her, and to annex to their gift, the <lb/>
stern condition of residing at a distance from them. Hence <lb/>
she was enabled to embark for America, without detecting <lb/>
their mistake, as to my death. They carefully shut their <lb/>
ears against all intelligence of her condition, whether direct <lb/>
or indirect, and will probably pass their lives in ignorance of <lb/>
that, which, if known, would only revive their upbraidings <lb/>
and regrets.</p>
<p>"I am not sorry for the hardships I have endured. They <lb/>
are not unpleasing to remembrance, and serve to brighten and <lb/>
endear the enjoyments of my present state, by contrast with <lb/>
former sufferings. I have enough for the kind of life which <lb/>
I prefer to all others, and have no desire to enlarge my stock. <lb/>
Meanwhile, I am anxious for the welfare of Miss Wilmot, and <lb/>
shall rejoice in having been, though undesignedly, the means <lb/>
of her prosperity.</p>
<p>"I heard, in Philadelphia, that a marriage was on foot <reg orig="be-|tween">between</reg> <lb/>
her and you. I flattered myself, when I met you this <lb/>
evening, that your companion was her, and secretly <reg orig="congrat-|ulated">congratulated</reg> <lb/>
you on the possession of so much gracefulness and <lb/>
beauty. In this, it seems, I was partly mistaken. This is a <lb/>
person very different from Mary Wilmot; but a friend, whom <lb/>
I met, shortly after parting from you, and to whom I <reg orig="de-|scribed">described</reg> <lb/>
her, assured me that this was the object of your <lb/>
choice. Pray, what has become of Miss Wilmot?"</p>
<p>I frankly confessed to him my ignorance of her condition, <lb/>
and related what had formerly been the relation between her <lb/>
and me. I expressed my surprise at finding that she was <lb/>
still in possession of the money, after the representations I <lb/>
had made; and at the silence she had so long observed.</p>
<p>When I recollected in what manner, and in whose <reg orig="compa-|ny">company</reg>, <lb/>
she had left Abingdon, I could not shut out some doubts, <lb/>
as to her integrity. She was, indeed, mistress of her own <lb/>
<pb n="60" entity="eaf033v5_0329" pid="uva-lib:350595"/>
actions, and Sedley was not unworthy of her choice; but her <lb/>
neglect of my letter, and her keeping this money, were <reg orig="sus-|picious">suspicious</reg> <lb/>
accompaniments. This belief was too painful to <reg orig="at-|tain">attain</reg> <lb/>
my ready acquiescence, and I occasionally consoled <lb/>
myself, by imagining her conduct to proceed from some <reg orig="mis-|apprehension">misapprehension</reg>, <lb/>
on the one or other part. Mrs. Valentine's <lb/>
reputation was unspotted, and under her guardianship, it was <lb/>
scarcely possible for any injury to approach my friend's <reg orig="per-|son">person</reg> <lb/>
or morals.</p>
<p>My anxiety to discover the truth was now increased. <reg orig="Af-|ter">After</reg> <lb/>
being so long accustomed to partake her cares, and <lb/>
watch over her safety, I could not endure this profound <reg orig="igno-|rance">ignorance</reg>. <lb/>
I was even uncertain as to her existence. It was <lb/>
impossible but that my friendship would be of some benefit. <lb/>
My sympathy could not fail to alleviate her sorrow, or <reg orig="en-|hance">enhance</reg> <lb/>
her prosperity.</p>
<p>But what means had I of removing this painful obscurity? <lb/>
I knew not which way to look for her. My discoveries <lb/>
must be wholly fortuitous.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding my own enjoyments, I allowed the image <lb/>
of Mary Wilmot to intrude into my thoughts too frequently. <lb/>
Some change in my temper was discerned by Clara, and <lb/>
she inquired into the cause. At first, I was deterred by <reg orig="in-|definite">indefinite</reg> <lb/>
scruples, from unfolding the cause, but some <reg orig="reflec-|tion">reflection</reg> <lb/>
shewed me I was wrong, in so long concealing from her <lb/>
a transaction of this moment. I therefore seized a favorable <lb/>
opportunity, and recounted all the incidents of my life, <reg orig="con-|nected">connected</reg> <lb/>
with this poor fugitive.</p>
<p>When I began, however, I was not aware of the <reg orig="embar-|rassments">embarrassments</reg> <lb/>
which I was preparing to suffer and inflict. We <lb/>
used to sit up much longer than our friends, and after they <lb/>
had retired to repose, taking their places on the sofa, allowed <lb/>
the embers to die gradually away, while we poured forth, <lb/>
unrestrained, the effusions of the moment. It was on one of <lb/>
these occasions that, after a short preface, I began my story. <lb/>
I detailed the origin of my intercourse with Miss Wilmot, the <lb/>
discovery of her passion for me, the contest between that <lb/>
passion and my indifference on one side, and the claims and <lb/>
solicitations of Sedley on the other. I was listened to with <lb/>
the deepest emotion. Curiosity enabled her to stifle it for <lb/>
some time; but when I came to the events of Wilmot's <lb/>
<pb n="61" entity="eaf033v5_0330" pid="uva-lib:350596"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">6*</fw></pb>
death, the discovery of his property, and the consequent <lb/>
agreement to marry, she was able to endure the recital no <lb/>
longer. She burst into tears, and articulated with difficulty. <lb/>
&mdash;"Enough, my friend, I know the rest&mdash;I know what you <lb/>
would say. Your melancholy is explained, and I see that <lb/>
my fate is fixed in eternal misery."</p>
<p>I was at once shocked, astonished, and delighted, by the <lb/>
discovery which was thus made, and made haste, by <reg orig="re-|counting">recounting</reg> <lb/>
subsequent transactions, to correct her error. She <lb/>
did not draw the same inferences from the flight and silence <lb/>
of the girl, or drew them with less confidence than I. She <lb/>
was not consoled by my avowals of passion for herself, and <lb/>
declared that she considered my previous contract as <reg orig="invio-|lable">inviolable</reg>. <lb/>
Nothing could absolve me from it, but the absolute <lb/>
renunciation of Miss Wilmot herself.</p>
<p>I considered the silence and disappearance of Mary as a <lb/>
sufficient renunciation of her claims, and once more dwelt <lb/>
upon the scruples and objections which she had formerly <lb/>
raised to our alliance, which had been, imperfectly, and for <lb/>
a time, removed by the death of her brother, and which <lb/>
Morton's arrival had restored to their original strength. <lb/>
Some regard, likewise, was due to my own felicity, and to <lb/>
that of one whose happiness deserved to be as zealously <lb/>
promoted as that of the fugitive. It was true, that I had <lb/>
tendered vows to Miss Wilmot, which my understanding, <lb/>
and not my heart&mdash;which gratitude, and not affection, had <lb/>
dictated. This tender, in the circumstances in which I was <lb/>
then placed, was necessary and proper; but these <reg orig="circum-|stances">circumstances</reg> <lb/>
had now changed. My offer had been tacitly <reg orig="re-|jected">rejected</reg>. <lb/>
Not only my love, but my friendship, had been <lb/>
slighted and despised. My affections had never been <reg orig="de-|voted">devoted</reg> <lb/>
to another, and the sacrifice of inclination was limited <lb/>
to myself. This indifference, however, existed no more. <lb/>
It was supplanted by a genuine and ardent attachment for <lb/>
one in all respects more worthy. I was willing to hope that <lb/>
this attachment was mutual. Fortune, and her parents, and <lb/>
and her own heart, were all propitious to my love; and to <lb/>
stifle and thwart it, for the sake of one who had abjured <lb/>
my society and my friendship&mdash;who renounced my <reg orig="proffer-|ed">proffered</reg> <lb/>
hand, and cancelled all my promises&mdash;who had possibly <lb/>
<pb n="62" entity="eaf033v5_0331" pid="uva-lib:350597"/>
made herself unworthy of my esteem, by the forfeiture of <lb/>
honor itself, or more probably had given up all her claims <lb/>
on my justice and compassion, by accepting another, would <lb/>
be, in the highest degree, absurd and unjustifiable.</p>
<p>These arguments wrought no effect upon Clara. It was <lb/>
her duty, she answered, to contend with selfish regards, and <lb/>
to judge of the feelings of others by her own. Whatever <lb/>
reluctance she might experience in resigning me to another, <lb/>
in whatever degree she might thwart the wishes and schemes <lb/>
of her parents, it was her duty to resign me, and she should <lb/>
derive more satisfaction from disinterested, than from selfish <lb/>
conduct. She would not attempt to disguise her feelings <lb/>
and wishes, and extenuate the sacrifice she was called on to <lb/>
make, but she had no doubt as to what was right, and her <lb/>
resolution to adhere to it would be immoveable.</p>
<p>This resolution, and this inflexibility, were wholly <reg orig="unex-|pected">unexpected</reg>. <lb/>
I was astonished and mortified; and having <reg orig="ex-|hausted">exhausted</reg> <lb/>
all my arguments in vain, gave way to some degree <lb/>
of acrimony and complaint, as if I were capriciously treated. <lb/>
At one time, I had thoughts of calling her parents to my aid, <lb/>
and explaining to them my situation with regard to Mary, <lb/>
and soliciting them to exert their authority in my behalf with <lb/>
Clara.</p>
<p>A deep and incurable sadness now appeared in my friend, <lb/>
and strong, though unostentatious, proofs were daily <reg orig="afford-|ed">afforded</reg>, <lb/>
that an exquisite sense of justice had dictated her <reg orig="de-|portment">deportment</reg>, <lb/>
and that she had laid upon herself a task to which <lb/>
her fortitude was scarcely equal. It appeared to me the <lb/>
highest cruelty to aggravate the difficulty of this task, by <reg orig="en-|listing">enlisting</reg> <lb/>
against her those whose authority she most revered, <lb/>
and whose happiness she was most desirous of promoting.</p>
<p>My eagerness to trace Miss Wilmot to her retreat, to find <lb/>
out her condition, and make her, if possible, my advocate <lb/>
with Clara, was increased by this unhappy resolution. I <reg orig="be-|gan">began</reg> <lb/>
to meditate anew upon the best means of effecting this. <lb/>
I blamed myself for having so long failed to employ all the <lb/>
means in my power, and resolved to begin my search <reg orig="with-|out">without</reg> <lb/>
delay. Clara, whose conclusions respecting Miss <reg orig="Wil-|mot's">Wilmot's</reg> <lb/>
motives were far more charitable than mine, was no <lb/>
less earnest in inciting me to this pursuit. She believed <lb/>
Miss Wilmot's conduct to have been consistent with integrity, <lb/>
<pb n="63" entity="eaf033v5_0332" pid="uva-lib:350598"/>
that it flowed from a generous but erroneous self-denial, and <lb/>
that the re-establishment of intercourse between us would <lb/>
terminate in the happiness of both.</p>
<p>The incidents formerly related had made it certain that <lb/>
Miss Wilmot had flown away in company with Sedley. <lb/>
Sedley's patrimony and fixed abode were in Virginia. <lb/>
There, it was most probable, that he and the fugitive would <lb/>
be found. There, at least, should Sedley have abandoned <lb/>
his ancient residence, was it most likely that the means of <lb/>
tracing his footsteps would be found. Mary, if not at <reg orig="pres-|ent">present</reg> <lb/>
in his company, or in that of his sister, had not perhaps <lb/>
concealed her asylum from them, and might be discovered <lb/>
by their means. Fortunately, Mr. Howard had <reg orig="engage-|ments">engagements</reg> <lb/>
at Richmond, which would shortly require his own <lb/>
presence, or that of one in whom he could confide. He <lb/>
had mentioned this necessity in my presence, in such a way <lb/>
as shewed that he would not be unwilling to transfer his <lb/>
business to me. Hitherto I had been unwilling to relinquish <lb/>
my present situation; but now I begged to be entrusted with <lb/>
his commission, as it agreed with my own projects.</p>
<p>In a few days I set out upon this journey. Passing <reg orig="neces-|sarily">necessarily</reg> <lb/>
at no great distance from Hatfield, I took that <reg orig="oppor-|tunity">opportunity</reg> <lb/>
of visiting my uncle and sisters. You may imagine <lb/>
my surprise on finding, at my uncle's house, a letter for me, <lb/>
from Mary, which had arrived there just after my departure, <lb/>
in the preceding autumn, and had lain, during the whole <lb/>
winter, neglected and forgotten, in a drawer.</p>
<p>This letter was worthy of my friend's generous and <reg orig="indig-|nant">indignant</reg> <lb/>
spirit, and fully accounted for her flight from Abingdon. <lb/>
She was determined to separate herself from me, to die in <lb/>
some obscure recess, whither I should never be able to trace <lb/>
her, and thus to remove every obstacle in the way of my <lb/>
pretensions to one, younger, lovelier, and richer than herself. <lb/>
In this letter was inclosed an order for the money, which, as <lb/>
I had taught her too hastily to believe, belonged to another.</p>
<p>I believe you know that I am not a selfish or unfeeling <lb/>
wretch. What but the deepest regret could I feel at the <lb/>
ignorance in which I had so long been kept of her destiny; <lb/>
what but vehement impatience to discover the place of her <lb/>
retreat, and persuade her to accept my vows, or, at least, to <lb/>
take back the money to which Morton's title was not yet <lb/>
<pb n="64" entity="eaf033v5_0333" pid="uva-lib:350599"/>
proved, which would save her at least from the horrors of that <lb/>
penury she was so little qualified to endure, and to which, <lb/>
for more than six inclement months, she had been, through <lb/>
unhappy misapprehensions, subjected?</p>
<p>In this mood I hastened to this city, but my heroism <lb/>
quickly evaporated. I felt no abatement of my eagerness <lb/>
to benefit the unhappy fugitive, by finding her, counselling <lb/>
her, consoling her, repossessing her of the means of easy, if <lb/>
not of affluent subsistence; but more than this, I felt myself <lb/>
incapable of offering. I knew full well, that, when acquainted <lb/>
with the whole truth, she never would accept me as her's; <lb/>
but I despaired of gaining any thing with respect to Clara, <lb/>
by that rejection. I despaired of ever lighting again on Miss <lb/>
Wilmot. Besides, my pride was piqued and wounded by <lb/>
resolutions that appeared to me absurd&mdash;to arise from <reg orig="pre-|judiced">prejudiced</reg> <lb/>
views and a narrow heart&mdash;from unreasonable regards <lb/>
bestowed upon one, of whose merits she had no direct <lb/>
knowledge, and blameable indifference to another, whom <lb/>
she had abundant reasons to love.</p>
<p>The letters that passed between us only tended to convince <lb/>
me that she was implacable, and I left the city of Philadelphia <lb/>
with a secret determination of never returning. I resolved <lb/>
to solicit Mr. Howard's permission to accompany some <lb/>
surveyors employed by him, who were to pass immediately <lb/>
into the western country. By this means, I hoped to shake <lb/>
off fetters that were now become badges of misery and <lb/>
ignominy.</p>
<p>The wisdom of man, when employed upon the future, <lb/>
is incessantly taught its own weakness. Had an angel <lb/>
whispered me, as I mounted the stage for Baltimore, that I <lb/>
should go no farther on that journey than Schuylkill, and <lb/>
that, without any new argument or effort on my part, Clara <lb/>
would, of her own accord, call me back to her and to <reg orig="happi-|ness">happiness</reg>, <lb/>
I should no doubt have discredited the intimation. <lb/>
Yet such was the event.</p>
<p>In order to rescue a drowning passenger, I leaped into the <lb/>
river. The weather being bleak and unwholesome, I was <lb/>
seized, shortly after my coming out, with a fever, which <lb/>
reduced me, in a very few days, to the brink of the grave. <lb/>
Now was the solicitude of my Clara awakened. When in <lb/>
danger of losing me for ever, she discovered the weakness <lb/>
<pb n="65" entity="eaf033v5_0334" pid="uva-lib:350600"/>
of her scruples, and effectually recalled me to life, by <reg orig="en-|treating">entreating</reg> <lb/>
me to live for her sake.</p>
<p>I have not yet perfectly recovered my usual health. I <lb/>
am unfit for business or for travelling; and standing in need <lb/>
of some amusement which will relieve, without fatiguing my <lb/>
attention, I called to mind your claims on me, and <reg orig="determin-|ed">determined</reg> <lb/>
to give you the account you desired.</p>
<p>When I received your letter, informing me of your design <lb/>
to meet me in New York, I was utterly dispirited and <reg orig="mis-|erable">miserable</reg>. <lb/>
My design of coming southward, I knew, would <lb/>
prevent an immediate meeting with you, and as I had then <lb/>
conceived the project of a journey to the western waters, <lb/>
I imagined that we should never have another meeting.</p>
<p>Now, my friend, my prospects are brighter, and I hope to <lb/>
greet you the moment of your arrival in New York. I <lb/>
shall go thither as soon as I am able. I shall never repose <lb/>
till my happiness with Clara is put beyond the power of man <lb/>
to defeat.</p>
<p>But, alas! what has become of Mary Wilmot. Heaven <lb/>
grant that she be safe. While unacquainted with her destiny, <lb/>
my happiness will never be complete; day and night I <reg orig="tor-|ment">torment</reg> <lb/>
myself with fruitless conjectures about her. Yet she <lb/>
went away with Sedley, a man of honor, and her lover, and <lb/>
with his sister, whose integrity cannot be questioned. With <lb/>
these she cannot be in danger, or in poverty. This <reg orig="reflec-|tion">reflection</reg> <lb/>
consoles me.</p>
<p>I long to see you my friend. I hope to be of some service <lb/>
to you. You will see, by this long detail, that fortune has <lb/>
been kind to me. Indeed, when I take a view of the events <lb/>
of the last year, I cannot find language for my wonder, my <lb/>
blessings are so numerous and exorbitant, my merits so <lb/>
slender.</p>
<p>I wish thee patience to carry thee to the end of this long <lb/>
letter.</p>

well? Tell me when; the day, the hour, when I may <lb/>
expect you. I will put new elegance into my garb; new <lb/>
health into my cheeks; new light, new love, new joy into <lb/>
my eyes, against that happy hour.</p>
<p>Would to Heaven I were with you. I represented to my <lb/>
father what an excellent nurse I should prove, but he would <lb/>
not suffer me to accompany him. I have a good mind to <lb/>
steal away to you, even now; but are you not already quite <lb/>
well? Yes, you are; or, very soon will be. Time and <lb/>
care are all that are required to make you so.</p>
<p>But, poor Mary&mdash;Does not your heart, my Philip, bleed <lb/>
for poor Mary? Can I rob her of so precious a good; <lb/>
bereave her of the gem of which she has so long been in <lb/>
secure possession? Can I riot in bliss, and deck myself in <lb/>
bridal ornaments, while she lives pining in dreary solitude, <lb/>
carrying to the grave a heart broken by the contumelies of <lb/>
the world; the horrors of indigence and neglect; and chiefly <lb/>
by the desertion of him on whom she doated?</p>
<p>Do I not know what it is to love? Cannot I easily <reg orig="ima-|gine">imagine</reg> <lb/>
what it is to bear about an unrequited passion? Have <lb/>
I not known, from infancy, the pleasures of affluence and <lb/>
homage? Cannot I conceive the mortifications to one thus <lb/>

them so justly, that till Mary is discovered, and has <lb/>
either been found happy, or been made happy, no selfish <lb/>
gratification whatever can insure my peace.</p>
<p>I should not thus be deeply interested for a mere stranger. <lb/>
I know your Mary. Your details, full of honesty and candor, <lb/>
have made me thoroughly acquainted with her. You have <lb/>
given me, in the picture of her life, the amplest picture of a <lb/>
human being that I ever was allowed to survey. Her virtue, <lb/>
my friend, has been tried. Not without foibles, for which she <lb/>
was indebted to her education; but her signal excellence <lb/>
lies in having, in spite of a pernicious education, so few faults.</p>
<p>My friend, you <hi rend="italic">must</hi> find her. As you value my <reg orig="happi-|ness">happiness</reg>, <lb/>

did not lead you to move heaven and earth in her cause, <lb/>
you would be, in my eyes, a wretch. Nay, if you did not&mdash; <lb/>
But I am straying from the path. I must not think of her, <lb/>

applauded, is, I am afraid, a miscreant&mdash;a villain. Mary&mdash; <lb/>
the very thought takes away my breath&mdash;is, I fear, a lost, <lb/>
undone creature.</p>
<p>Yet how?&mdash;Such a fall surely was impossible. Mary <lb/>
Wilmot, whose whole life has been exposed to my view&mdash; <lb/>
whom I have seen in the most unguarded moments&mdash;whose <lb/>
indifference to Sedley&mdash;whose unconquerable aversion to <lb/>
his most honorable and flattering offers I have so often <lb/>
<pb n="68" entity="eaf033v5_0337" pid="uva-lib:350603"/>
witnessed, could not forget herself. Her dignity&mdash;I will <lb/>
not believe it.</p>
<p>But what am I saying? Let me recollect myself, and <lb/>
lay distinctly before you the cause of my apprehensions.</p>
<p>This morning, being disengaged, and the air mild, instead <lb/>
of going on with this letter, I stole abroad to enjoy the sweet <lb/>
breath of heaven. My feet carried me unawares to the <lb/>
door of the house in which I formerly passed a servitude of <lb/>
three years. My old master, Watkins, of time measuring <lb/>
memory, has been some time dead. The widow turned <lb/>
her stock into revenue, and now lives at her ease. Though <lb/>
not eminently good, she is far from being a bad woman. <lb/>
She never behaved otherwise than kindly to "Philip <reg orig="Sober-|sides">Sobersides</reg>," <lb/>
as she used to call me, and I felt somewhat like <reg orig="gra-|titude">gratitude</reg>, <lb/>
which would not let me pass the door. So I called <lb/>
to see the old dame.</p>
<p>I found her by a close-stove in the parlor, knitting a blue <lb/>
stocking&mdash;"Lack a day!" said she, "why, as I's a living <lb/>
soul, this is our Philip!"</p>
<p>After the usual congratulations and inquiries were made, <lb/>
she proceeded&mdash;"Why, what a fine story is this, Philip, <lb/>
that we hear of you?&mdash;Why, they say you've grown a rich <lb/>
man's son, and are going to be married to a fine rich great <lb/>
lady, from some other country."</p>
<p>I avoided a direct answer. She continued&mdash;"Ah! dear <lb/>
me, we all thought you were going to be married to poor <lb/>
Molly Wilmot, the mantuamaker&mdash;Nay, for the matter o' <lb/>
that, my poor dear man, I remember, said as how, that if so <lb/>
be we'd wait a year or so, we should see things turn up so, <lb/>
that you and her should be married already, at that time; <lb/>
and that, I remember, was just as your time was up. But <lb/>
Molly (with a very significant air this was said) has carried <lb/>
her goods to a much worse market, it seems."</p>
<p>"Why, know you any thing of Miss Wilmot?"</p>
<p>"Why, I don't know but as I does. I doesn't know <lb/>
much to her advantage though, you may depend, Philip."</p>
<p>I was startled&mdash;"What do you know of her?&mdash;Tell me, <lb/>
I beseech you, all you know."</p>
<p>"Why, I don't know much, not I; but Peggy, my nurse, <lb/>
said something or other about her, yesterday. She drank <lb/>
tea with me&mdash;"</p>
<pb n="69" entity="eaf033v5_0338" pid="uva-lib:350604"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">7</fw></pb>
<p>"Pray," said I, impatiently, "what said your nurse of <lb/>
Miss Wilmot?"</p>
<p>"Why, I don't know as I ought to tell&mdash;"</p>
<p>But I will not teaze you, Clara, as I was tired with the <lb/>
jargon of the old woman. I will give you the sum of her <lb/>
intelligence in my own words.</p>
<p>The nurse had lately been in the family of Mr. Kalm, of <lb/>
Germantown, between which and that of Mrs. Valentine, I <lb/>
have long known that much intimacy subsisted. Sedley, it <lb/>
seems, passed through this city about three weeks ago, and <lb/>
spent a day at Mr. Kalm's. At dinner, when the nurse was <lb/>
present, the conversation turned upon the marriage of <reg orig="Sed-|ley">Sedley</reg>, <lb/>
which, it seems, was just concerted with the daughter of <lb/>
a wealthy family in Virginia. The lady's name was <reg orig="men-|tioned">mentioned</reg>, <lb/>
but the nurse forgot it.</p>
<p>Mrs. Kalm, who is noted for the freedom of her <reg orig="dis-|course">discourse</reg>, <lb/>
reminded Mr. Sedley of the mantuamaker who <reg orig="elop-|ed">eloped</reg> <lb/>
with him from Abingdon last autumn, and jestingly <reg orig="in-|quired">inquired</reg> <lb/>
into her present condition. Sedley dealt in hints and <lb/>
innuendoes, which imported that he was on as good terms <lb/>
with Molly Wilmot as he desired to be; that all his wishes <lb/>
with respect to her were now accomplished; that she knew <lb/>
her own interest too well to allow any obstruction to his <reg orig="mar-|riage">marriage</reg> <lb/>
to come from her; that she would speedily resume <lb/>
her customary station in society, as the <hi rend="italic">cause</hi> of her present <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">disappearance</hi> was likely to be soon removed.</p>
<p>I will not torment you or myself by dwelling on further <lb/>
particulars. My informant was deplorably defective in the <lb/>
means of imparting any clear and consistent meaning. An <lb/>
hour was employed in recollecting facts and answering <reg orig="ques-|tions">questions</reg>, <lb/>
all which, taken together, imported nothing less than <lb/>
that an improper connexion had for some months subsisted <lb/>
between Sedley and my friend&mdash;a connexion of such a <reg orig="na-|ture">nature</reg> <lb/>
as was not consistent with his marriage with another.</p>
<p>Comfort me&mdash;counsel me, my angel. I gathered from <lb/>
the beldame's tale, the probability at least, that Mary <reg orig="Wil-|mot">Wilmot</reg> <lb/>
was still in this city. Shall I seek her?&mdash;shall I?&mdash; <lb/>
Tell me, in short, what I must believe? what I shall do?</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">I have</hi> just returned from Germantown, and find your <lb/>
letter on my table. Thank heaven, I have not merited all <lb/>
your rebukes. That anxiety to ascertain the truth, and that <lb/>
unwillingness to trust to such witnesses as gossips and nurses, <lb/>
which you think I ought to feel, I really have felt. My last <lb/>
was written in the first tumult of my thoughts. The moment <lb/>
I laid down the pen, and began more deliberately to reflect <lb/>
upon the subject, doubts and hopes thronged into my <reg orig="imagi-|nation">imagination</reg>; <lb/>
I resolved to bend every nerve to discover the <reg orig="re-|treat">retreat</reg> <lb/>
of Mary, and ascertain her true situation.</p>
<p>As Sedley was so well known to Mrs. Kalm, I resolved to <lb/>
visit that lady. I had no acquaintance with her, but I <reg orig="over-|looked">overlooked</reg> <lb/>
the impropriety of my application, and set out <reg orig="imme-|diately">immediately</reg> <lb/>
to Germantown.</p>
<p>Being admitted to an apartment, in which I found that lady <lb/>
alone, I introduced myself in some confused way, I scarcely <lb/>
know how; and inquired whether she knew the person <lb/>
whom Sedley was about to marry, and whether she could <lb/>
afford me any information of the place where Mary Wilmot <lb/>
was likely to be found?</p>
<p>She answered with great civility, that Sedley's sister was <lb/>
her dear friend; that Mrs. Valentine resided at this time in <lb/>
New England; that her brother passing lately through this <lb/>
city, in order to join her, had spent part of a day with <lb/>
Mr. Kalm; that Sedley had given his friends leave to <reg orig="con-|sider">consider</reg> <lb/>
him as upon the eve of marriage, but had not thought <lb/>
proper to disclose to them the name and family of the lady; <lb/>
that they were totally in the dark on both these heads, but <lb/>
were inclined to believe that she was a woman of Boston; <lb/>
that as to Mary Wilmot, she knew nothing of her or her <lb/>
affairs.</p>
<p>Mrs. Kalm's curiosity was somewhat excited by the <reg orig="sin-|gularity">singularity</reg> <lb/>
of my introduction, and she soon became inquisitive <lb/>
in her turn. Encouraged by her frank and communicative <lb/>
<pb n="72" entity="eaf033v5_0341" pid="uva-lib:350607"/>
humor, I ventured to explain unreservedly the motive of my <lb/>
inquiries. She smiled at the impression which the tale of <lb/>
the nurse and gossip had made on my fears.</p>
<p>"Your uneasiness," said she, "was without any <reg orig="founda-|tion">foundation</reg>. <lb/>
Perhaps we might have jestingly talked of Miss <reg orig="Wil-|mot's">Wilmot's</reg> <lb/>
elopement with Sedley, because his pretensions to that <lb/>
girl are pretty well known; but I am not now to be told that <lb/>
your friend was, on that journey, the companion not of the <lb/>
brother, but the sister; and that Miss Wilmot's reputation <lb/>
and virtue could not be safer under her own guardianship <lb/>
than under Mrs. Valentine's&mdash;besides, there is not a man <lb/>
in the world of stricter principles than Sedley.&mdash;What you <lb/>
have heard, or something like it, might actually have passed <lb/>
at that dinner; but no one could have construed it in a way <lb/>
injurious to Sedley or your friend, but who was wholly <reg orig="un-|acquainted">unacquainted</reg> <lb/>
with the parties, or who was very hungry after <lb/>
slander.</p>
<p>"Sedley certainly talked as if he knew more of Miss <lb/>
Wilmot than he just then thought fit to disclose.&mdash;What he <lb/>
said was accompanied with nods and smiles of some <reg orig="signifi-|cance">significance</reg>; <lb/>
but I should just as readily have put an evil <reg orig="con-|struction">construction</reg> <lb/>
on his hints, had he been talking of his own sister. <lb/>
All the world knows that a woman of merit would be sure to <lb/>
receive from Sedley, exactly the treatment which an <reg orig="affec-|tionate">affectionate</reg> <lb/>
brother would be disposed to give.</p>
<p>"As to Miss Wilmot's disappearance, I never knew till now <lb/>
there was any thing mysterious or suspicious in her conduct. <lb/>
It is true, she left her former residence; but considering in <lb/>
whose company she left it, and the privacy and solitude in <lb/>
which she had previously lived, I was inclined to think she <lb/>
had risen into sight and notice, and instead of retiring from <lb/>
observation, had come forth more conspicuously than ever. <lb/>
This was necessarily the case, if she lived or associated, as <lb/>
she probably did, with Mrs. Valentine.</p>
<p>"When Sedley talked of the cause of her journey being <lb/>
removed, and her reassuming her station among us, I <reg orig="con-|fess">confess</reg> <lb/>
he was unintelligible to me. I knew of no cause for her <lb/>
journey but her own pleasure, and perhaps Mrs. Valentine's <lb/>
entreaties. The construction which a casual hearer seems <lb/>
to have put upon his words was foolish and preposterous; <lb/>
indeed, it is highly offensive to me, since it pre-supposed <lb/>
<pb n="73" entity="eaf033v5_0342" pid="uva-lib:350608"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">7*</fw></pb>
that I could patiently hear any one utter such insinuations at <lb/>
my table."</p>
<p>Mrs. Kalm seemed much hurt at the misapprehensions of <lb/>
the nurse, and was very earnest in vindicating Sedley's <reg orig="in-|nocence">innocence</reg>. <lb/>
She bore testimony to the undeviating and <reg orig="ex-|emplary">exemplary</reg> <lb/>
propriety of Miss Wilmot's conduct, ever since it <lb/>
had been within the reach of her observation.</p>
<p>Thou wilt imagine, Clara, with what unspeakable delight I <lb/>
listened to her eulogy. I was astonished at my own folly, <lb/>
in drawing such extravagant conclusions. My own heart <lb/>
pleads guilty to thy charges of credulity and precipitation; <lb/>
but I hope I shall not be so grossly or so easily deceived a <lb/>
second time.</p>
<p>Mrs. Kalm could give me no account of the present <reg orig="situ-|ation">situation</reg> <lb/>
of my friend; but she gave me Mrs. Valentine's <reg orig="ad-|dress">address</reg>. <lb/>
From her, no doubt, I shall be able to obtain all the <lb/>
information I want. I was a stupid wretch not sooner to <reg orig="in-|quire">inquire</reg> <lb/>
among the lady's numerous friends where she was to <lb/>
be found. I will write to her immediately.</p>
<p>Congratulate me, my beloved, on this opening of brighter <lb/>
prospects for one who is equally and deservedly dear to both <lb/>
of us. Unless you make haste to write, I shall receive your <lb/>
congratulations in person, for I feel myself already well <lb/>
enough to travel in your company to the world's end. Adieu.</p>

no answer to my last, yet I cannot be alone in my chamber, <lb/>

them up and talking to my friend thus. This is a mode of <lb/>
conversing I would willingly exchange for the more lively <lb/>
and congenial intercourse of eyes and lips; but 'tis better <lb/>
than total silence.</p>
<pb n="74" entity="eaf033v5_0343" pid="uva-lib:350609"/>
<p>What are you doing now? Busy, I suppose, in turning <lb/>
over the leaves of some book&mdash;some painter of manners or <lb/>
of nature is before you&mdash;some dramatist, or poet, or historian, <lb/>
furnishes you with occupation. The day here is celestially <lb/>
benign&mdash;such only as our climate can know. It is not less <lb/>
splendid and serene with you, so you have strolled into that <lb/>
field, which is not excelled for the grandeur of its scenery, <lb/>
the balsamic and reviving virtue of its breezes, its <reg orig="commo-|diousness">commodiousness</reg> <lb/>
of situation for the purpose of relieving those <reg orig="con-|demned">condemned</reg> <lb/>
to a city life, by any field on this globe. The battery <lb/>
&mdash;what a preposterous name! Yet not the only instance of <lb/>
a mound serving at once the double purpose of pleasure and <lb/>
defence. Did you not say the bulwarks of Paris were <lb/>
pleasure walks? You have been in Sicily and Provence, <lb/>
did you ever meet with sun, sky, and water, more <reg orig="magni-|ficent">magnificent</reg>, <lb/>
and air more bland than you are now contemplating <lb/>
and breathing? for methinks I see that lovely form gliding <lb/>
along the green, or fixed in musing posture at the rails, and <lb/>
listening to the rippling of the waters.</p>
<p>Perhaps some duty keeps you at home. You expect a <lb/>
visitant; are seated at your toilet, adding all the <reg orig="enchant-|ments">enchantments</reg> <lb/>
of drapery, the brilliant hues and the flowing train of <lb/>
muslin, to a form whose excellence it is to be beautiful when <lb/>
unadorned, and yet to gain from every ornament new beauty.</p>
<p>What a rare lot is yours, Clara!&mdash;One of the most <reg orig="for-|tunate">fortunate</reg> <lb/>
of women art thou. Wealth, affluence, is yours; but <lb/>
wealth is only the means of every kind of happiness; it is <lb/>
not happiness itself. But you have not only the tools, but <lb/>
the inclination to use them. In no hands could riches be <lb/>
placed so as to produce more felicity to the possessor, and <lb/>
to those within reach of her munificence.</p>
<p>Which is the most unerring touchstone of merit&mdash;poverty <lb/>
or riches? Ingeniously to supply the place, or gracefully to <lb/>
endure the want of riches, is the privilege of great minds. <lb/>
To retain humility and probity in spite of riches, and to effect <lb/>
the highest good of ourselves and others by the use of them, <lb/>
is the privilege of minds still greater. The last privilege is <lb/>
Clara's; the first, vanity has sometimes said&mdash;no matter <lb/>
what. It was, indeed, vanity that said it&mdash;vanity, that is now <lb/>
humbled into wisdom and self distrust. So far from bearing <lb/>
poverty with dignity, I cannot justly call my former situation <lb/>
<pb n="75" entity="eaf033v5_0344" pid="uva-lib:350610"/>
by that name, and was far from bearing even the moderate <lb/>
privations of that state with fortitude.</p>
<p>And are, indeed, these privations forever at an end? Is <lb/>
the harder test of wisdom, the true use of riches, now to be <lb/>
imposed upon me? It is&mdash;Clara Howard and all that she <lb/>
inherits will be mine. I ought to tremble for the <reg orig="conse-|quences">consequences</reg> <lb/>
of exposure to such temptations; and if I stood <lb/>
alone I should tremble; but, in reality, whatever is your's, or <lb/>
your father's gift, is not mine. Your power over it shall be <lb/>
unlimited and uncontroled by me; and this, not more from <lb/>
the equity of your claim to the sole power, than from the <lb/>
absolute rectitude with which that power will be exercised <lb/>
by you. Had I millions of my own acquiring, I should deem <lb/>
it no more than my duty to resign to you the employment of <lb/>
them.</p>
<p>Ah! my divine friend, I will be no more than your agent <lb/>
&mdash;your almoner; one whose aid may make charity less <reg orig="toil-|some">toilsome</reg> <lb/>
to you&mdash;may free the pleasures of beneficence from <lb/>
some of those pains by which they are usually attended. I <lb/>
will go before you, plucking up thorns and removing <reg orig="asperi-|ties">asperities</reg> <lb/>
from the path that you choose. All my recompense shall <lb/>
be the consciousness in whose service I labor, and whose <lb/>
pleasures I enhance.</p>
<p>They tell us that ambition is natural to man; that no <reg orig="pos-|session">possession</reg> <lb/>
is so pleasing as power and command. I do not find <lb/>
it so. I would fain be a universal benefactor. The power <lb/>
that office or riches confers is requisite to this end; but <lb/>
power in infirm hands is productive only of mischief. I who <lb/>
know my own frailty, am therefore undesirous of power&mdash;so <lb/>
far from wishing to rule others, it is my glory and my boast <lb/>
to submit to one whom I deem unerring and divine. Clara's <lb/>
will is my law; her pleasure the science that I study; her <lb/>
smiles the reward, next to an approving God, my soul prizes <lb/>
most dearly.</p>
<p>Indeed, my friend, before you honor me with your choice, <lb/>
you should contrive to exalt me or lower yourself. Some <lb/>
parity there ought to be between us&mdash;an angel in the heavens <lb/>
like thee, is not a fit companion for a mere earthworm like</p>

<p>I hastily withdrew, and then, Philip, having gained the <lb/>
friendly covert of my chamber, I eagerly&mdash;rapturously, <lb/>
kissed and read thy letters.</p>
<p>I thought it would prove a mere slander; and yet I was <lb/>

me more than I can tell; but thy intelligence has not <lb/>

produced, but, in reality, has given me uncommon pleasure. <lb/>
I flatter myself that your letter to Mrs. Valentine will receive <lb/>
a speedy and satisfactory answer.</p>
<p>Human life, Philip, is a motley scene. Thou wilt not <lb/>
thank me for the novelty of that remark; but the truth of it, <lb/>
I think, has received new illustration in the little incidents on <lb/>
which thy last letters have commented. Had not the old <lb/>
nurse's tale incited thee to inquiry, thou wouldst not, at this <lb/>
moment, have been in the way to gain any knowledge of <lb/>
poor Mary&mdash;had not thy sad prognostics filled me with <lb/>
melancholy, my mother's attention would not have been <lb/>
excited to the cause of my uneasiness.</p>
<p>I did not conceal from her the cause. I made her pretty <lb/>
well acquainted with the history of Mary. She was deeply <lb/>
<pb n="77" entity="eaf033v5_0346" pid="uva-lib:350612"/>
interested in the story I told and suggested many inquiries <lb/>
respecting her, which I had overlooked. She has made me <lb/>
extremely anxious as to some particulars, on which perhaps <lb/>
you can give me the desired information.</p>
<p>Pray tell me what you know of the history of her family, <lb/>
before her father's leaving Europe. Where was he born? <lb/>
Where lived he? What profession did he follow? What <lb/>
know you of the history of Mary's mother?</p>
<p>Excuse me for confining myself, at present, to these <lb/>
inquiries. Tell me all you know on this subject, and I will <lb/>
then acquaint you with the motive of my inquisitiveness. I <lb/>
shall expect to hear from you on Thursday morning.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">I am</hi> at a loss, dear Clara, to account for thy questions; <lb/>
but I will answer them to the utmost of my power. The <lb/>
same questions frequently occurred to me, in my intercourse <lb/>
with the Wilmots. It was natural, you know, to suppose <lb/>
that they had left relations in their native country, with whom <lb/>
it might be of some advantage to renew their intercourse.</p>
<p>Mary was ten years old when her father took up his abode <lb/>
in Delaware; but he had been already five years in the <lb/>
country, so that you will easily perceive she was not likely <lb/>
to possess much personal knowledge of events, previous to <lb/>
their voyage. Her mother's death happened just before <lb/>
their removal to Wilmington. It appears to have been the <lb/>
chief cause of that removal.</p>
<p>Your letter has put me on the task of recollection. I am <lb/>
sorry that I am able to collect and arrange very few <reg orig="circum-|stances">circumstances</reg>, <lb/>
such as you demand. The Wilmots were either <lb/>
very imperfectly acquainted with the history of their parents, <lb/>
or were anxious to bury their history in oblivion. The first <lb/>
was probably the situation of the son; but I have often <lb/>
<pb n="78" entity="eaf033v5_0347" pid="uva-lib:350613"/>
suspected, from the contradictions and evasions of which <lb/>
Mary was at different times guilty, when this subject was <lb/>
talked of between us, that the daughter pretended ignorance, <lb/>
for the sake of avoiding the mortification of telling the truth. <lb/>
When once urged pretty closely on this head, she indeed, <lb/>
told me the subject was a painful one to her; that she knew <lb/>
nothing of her European kindred, which would justify the <lb/>
searching them out; and that she would hold herself obliged <lb/>
to me if I never recalled past events to her remembrance. <lb/>
After this injunction I was silent; but in the course of <reg orig="num-|berless">numberless</reg> <lb/>
conversations afterwards, hints were casually dropped, <lb/>
which afforded me, now and then, a glimpse into their family <lb/>
history.</p>
<p>When Mary spoke of her father, it was always with <lb/>
reverence for his talents, gratitude for his indulgence to her, <lb/>
and compassion for that frailty of character, which made <lb/>
him seek in dissipation relief from sorrow on account of the <lb/>
death of a wife whom he adored; and a refuge, as she <lb/>
sometimes obscurely intimated, from some calamity or <reg orig="hu-|miliation">humiliation</reg> <lb/>
which befel him in his native country.</p>
<p>My friend's heart always throbbed, and her eyes were <lb/>
filled with tears, whenever her mother was remembered. <lb/>
She took a mournful pleasure in describing her mother's <lb/>
person and manners, in which she was prone to believe <lb/>
all human excellence was comprised. Her own melancholy <lb/>
temper and gloomy destiny she imagined to have descended <lb/>
to her by inheritance; and she once allowed me to collect <lb/>
from her discourse, that her mother had died the victim of <lb/>
some early and heavy disappointment.</p>
<p>We were once, the winter before last, conversing by an <lb/>
evening fire, on that most captivating topic, ourselves. <lb/>
Having said something of my attachment to my country, <lb/>
and especially to the hill side, where I first drew breath, and <lb/>
inquired into her feelings in relation to the same objects&mdash;</p>
<p>"Alas!" said she, "I should be puzzled to say to what <lb/>
country I belonged&mdash;I am a German by my father, English <lb/>
by my mother. I was born at a hotel in Paris; I was <lb/>
nursed by a woman of Nice, where I passed my infancy; and <lb/>
my youth and womanhood, and probably my whole life, <lb/>
belong to America. Now, what is the country, Germany, <lb/>
England, France, Italy, or America, which I have a right <lb/>
<pb n="79" entity="eaf033v5_0348" pid="uva-lib:350614"/>
to call my own? The earliest object of my recollection <lb/>
is the face of my nurse, who accompanied us in all our <lb/>
wanderings, and who died just before my father, on <reg orig="Brandy-|wine">Brandywine</reg>. <lb/>
The olives, the orange-walks, and the seashore <lb/>
scenery of Savoy, are still fresh in my remembrance. <lb/>
Should I visit them again, no doubt my feelings would be <lb/>
strongly affected; but I never expect to visit them."</p>
<p>"But your father's, your mother's natal spot would have <lb/>
some charms, methinks, to one of your sensibility."</p>
<p>"Some influence, no doubt, the contemplation would <lb/>
have, but no charms. Strange, if I should ever have an <lb/>
opportunity of trying their effect upon my feelings."</p>
<p>"You are acquainted then with the birth-place of your <lb/>
father and mother?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I have heard them described so often, and with <lb/>
such minuteness, that I should recognize them, I think, at <lb/>
any distance of time.&mdash;My father was born in the Grey <lb/>
Street, next to the chapel of St. Anne, at Altona. My <lb/>
mother and family have subsisted, from the days of William <lb/>
the Norman, at a spot, five miles from Taunton, in <reg orig="De-|vonshire">Devonshire</reg>."</p>
<p>I was in hopes that these particulars were peliminary to <lb/>
more interesting disclosures; but my friend now changed <lb/>
the subject of conversation, and would not be brought back <lb/>
to the point I wished.</p>
<p>Mr. Wilmot was a man of liberal education and cultivated <lb/>
taste. This appears from the representations of his <reg orig="daugh-|ter">daughter</reg>, <lb/>
and likewise from several books which she preserved <lb/>
by connivance of his creditors, and which are enriched by <lb/>
many notes and memorandums in her father's handwriting. <lb/>
These betoken an enlarged mind and extensive knowledge. <lb/>
She has likewise a sort of journal, kept by him when a mere <lb/>
youth, during two or three year's residence in Boulogne, in <lb/>
the character, as I suspect, of a commercial agent.&mdash;This <lb/>
journal, which I have occasionally seen, affords many proofs <lb/>
of a sprightly and vigorous mind.</p>
<p>This, my friend, is the whole of my present recollections <lb/>
on this subject. I am anxious to know what has suggested <lb/>
your inquiry. Is your mother acquainted with any of the <lb/>
family in Europe?&mdash;With the history of Wilmot before he <lb/>
came hither? Pray tell me all you know in your next. <lb/>
Adieu.</p>

</opener>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">As</hi> soon as I had read your letter, I hurried to my <reg orig="moth-|er">mother</reg>. <lb/>
All her conjectures are ascertained&mdash;a native of <reg orig="Hol-|stein&mdash;family">Holstein&mdash;family</reg> <lb/>
abode near Taunton&mdash;victim of some early <lb/>
distress! These circumstances place the truth beyond <reg orig="con-|troversy&mdash;but">controversy&mdash;but</reg> <lb/>
I will tell you the story with somewhat more <lb/>
order.</p>
<p>I told you that my mother's curiosity was awakened by <lb/>
the effect of your gloomy prognostics. I told her every <lb/>
thing respecting Mary Wilmot, but her love for you.</p>
<p>"Wilmot, Wilmot," said she, "an English family&mdash;came <lb/>
over twenty years ago. I think I know something of them. <lb/>
Their story was a singular one&mdash;a disastrous one. I should <lb/>
like to know more of their history. I think it not <reg orig="improba-|ble">improbable</reg> <lb/>
that these are the same Wilmots with whose history I <lb/>
am perfectly acquainted&mdash;nay more, who were no very <reg orig="dis-|tant">distant</reg> <lb/>
relations of our own. Pray write to Philip, and get <lb/>
from him all he knows of their early adventures. Inquire <lb/>
if the father was from Holstein, and the mother from <reg orig="Devon-|shire">Devonshire</reg>, <lb/>
and if Mary was born at Paris?"</p>
<p>You see, my friend, your letter has satisfactorily <reg orig="confirm-|ed">confirmed</reg> <lb/>
these guesses; and now will I relate to you the early <lb/>
history of this family, in the words of my mother. Mary <lb/>
will be greatly astonished when she comes to find how much <lb/>
you know of her family&mdash;much more, 'tis probable, than <lb/>
she herself knows&mdash;and to discover that the nearest relation <lb/>
she has in the world is myself. Being alone with my <reg orig="mo-|ther">mother</reg> <lb/>
on Thursday evening, she fulfilled the promise she had <lb/>
made, to tell me all she knew of the Wilmots, in these <lb/>
words&mdash;</p>
<p>"Mary Anne was the only daughter of my father's only <lb/>
brother, consequently she was my cousin. She was nearly <lb/>
of my own age, and being the only child of a man <reg orig="respect-|able">respectable</reg> <lb/>
for birth and property, and my near relation, and <reg orig="par-|ticularly">particularly</reg> <lb/>
of my own sex, we were intimately connected it <lb/>
<pb n="81" entity="eaf033v5_0350" pid="uva-lib:350616"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">8</fw></pb>
an early age. She lost her mother in her infancy, and our <lb/>
family having several daughters, our house was thought more <lb/>
suited to her education than her father's. She lived with <lb/>
me and my sisters till she was eighteen years of age, <reg orig="receiv-|ing">receiving</reg> <lb/>
from us, our brothers, and our parents, exactly the same <lb/>
treatment which a real sister and daughter received.</p>
<p>"There was no particular affection between Mary and <lb/>
myself; our tempers did not chance to coincide&mdash;her taste <lb/>
led her to one species of amusement, and mine to another. <lb/>
This difference stood in the way of that union of interests <lb/>
which, however, took place between her and my elder sister. <lb/>
Still, there were few persons in the world for whom I had a <lb/>
more ardent esteem; or more tender affection, than for my <lb/>
cousin Mary Anne. She parted from us at the age of <lb/>
eighteen, in obedience to the summons of her father, who <lb/>
wished to place her at the head of his household. We lived <lb/>
in the north, and Mr. Lisle lived in Devonshire, so that <lb/>
we had little hope of any intercourse but by letter. This <lb/>
intercourse was very punctually maintained between her and <lb/>
my sister, and it was by means of this correspondence that <lb/>
we obtained the knowledge of subsequent events.</p>
<p>"On leaving our family, my cousin entered into a world <lb/>
of strangers; a sphere very incongenial with her temper and <lb/>
habits. So long a separation had deprived the parental <lb/>
character of all those claims to reverence and confidence, <lb/>
which are apt to arise when the lives of father and <reg orig="daugh-|ter">daughter</reg> <lb/>
are spent under the same roof. She saw in my uncle a <lb/>
man, who, in many essential particulars both of speculation <lb/>
and of practice, was at variance with herself, and to whom <lb/>
nature had given prerogatives, which her fearful temper <reg orig="fore-|boded">foreboded</reg> <lb/>
would be oftener exerted to her injury than benefit. <lb/>
His inmates, his companions, his employments, his sports, <lb/>
were dissonant with all the feelings she was most <reg orig="accustom-|ed">accustomed</reg> <lb/>
to cherish; in short, her new situation was in the highest <lb/>
degree irksome.</p>
<p>"She naturally looked abroad for that comfort which she <lb/>
could not find at home; she formed intimacies with several <lb/>
persons of her own sex, among others, with Miss Saunders, <lb/>
the daughter of a Bristol merchant, with whom she spent as <lb/>
much time as her father would allow her to spend. Her <lb/>
<pb n="82" entity="eaf033v5_0351" pid="uva-lib:350617"/>
winter months were generally passed in the society of that <lb/>
young lady at Bristol, while her friend in summer was her <lb/>
guest in the country.</p>
<p>"It was at the house of Mr. Saunders that she became <lb/>
acquainted with Veelmetz, or Wilmot, a young man of <reg orig="un-|common">uncommon</reg> <lb/>
elegance and insinuation. He was a native of <lb/>
Germany, but had received his early education in England. <lb/>
He had at this time been for two or three years chief, or <lb/>
confidential clerk, in an English mercantile house at <reg orig="Bou-|logne">Boulogne</reg>; <lb/>
but made occasional excursions on behalf of his <reg orig="em-|ployers">employers</reg> <lb/>
to the neighboring countries. Some concerns <reg orig="de-|tained">detained</reg> <lb/>
him a few months at Bristol, and being on a familiar <lb/>
footing with the family of Saunders, he there became <reg orig="ac-|quainted">acquainted</reg> <lb/>
with my cousin.</p>
<p>"On the first interview my cousin was in love with the <lb/>
stranger. It is impossible to tell how far the laws of strict <lb/>
honor were observed by Wilmot in his behavior to my <lb/>
cousin, either before or after the discovery of her attachment <lb/>
to him&mdash;certain it is, that his heart was devoted to another, <lb/>
at the period of his interview with Mary Anne; that she at <lb/>
all times earnestly acquitted him of any duplicity or <reg orig="treache-|ry">treachery</reg> <lb/>
towards her, and ascribed the unfortunate cause of their <lb/>
mutual shame and embarrassment to some infatuation; in <lb/>
consequence of which, a man who concealed not his love <lb/>
and engagement to another, and without the sanction or the <lb/>
promise of marriage, prevailed on her to forget her dignity <lb/>
and her duty.</p>
<p>"Both parties deserved blame&mdash;which deserved it most, <lb/>
and how far their guilt might be extenuated or atoned for <lb/>
by the circumstances attending it, it is impossible to tell. <lb/>
Mary Anne was a great, a mixed, and doubtless a faulty <reg orig="cha-|racter">character</reg>. <lb/>
The world in general was liberal of its eulogies on <lb/>
the probity, as well as on the graces and talents of Wilmot. <lb/>
His subsequent behavior lays claim to some praise; but his <lb/>
fatal meeting with my cousin proved that the virtue of both <lb/>
was capable of yielding, when the integrity of worse people <lb/>
would easily have stood firm.</p>
<p>"About the same time Wilmot returned to Boulogne, and <lb/>
my cousin accompanied her father to Paris. The lady to <lb/>
whom the former was betrothed, was the daughter of the <lb/>
principal in that house where Wilmot had long been a <reg orig="ser-|vant">servant</reg>, <lb/>
<pb n="83" entity="eaf033v5_0352" pid="uva-lib:350618"/>
and in which, in consequence of his merits, he was now <lb/>
shortly to become a son and partner. The nuptial day was <lb/>
fixed.</p>
<p>"Before the arrival of that day, he wrote a letter to Mary <lb/>
Anne, acquainting her with his present situation, reminding <lb/>
her that he never practised any fraud or concealment in his <lb/>
intercourse with her, yet, nevertheless, offering to come, and <lb/>
either by an open application to her father, or by a <reg orig="clandes-|tine">clandestine</reg> <lb/>
marriage, prevent any evil that might threaten her safety <lb/>
or her reputation.</p>
<p>"This letter placed my cousin in the most distressful <lb/>
dilemma that can be conceived. Her heart was still fondly <lb/>
devoted to him that made this offer; a fair fame was <reg orig="pre-|cious">precious</reg> <lb/>
in her eyes; her father's wrath was terrible. She <lb/>
knew that the accident which Wilmot was willing to provide <lb/>
against, would soon inevitably befall her; yet in her answer to <lb/>
his letter the possibility of this accident was denied, her <reg orig="at-|tachment">attachment</reg> <lb/>
was denied, and he was earnestly conjured to <reg orig="com-|plete">complete</reg> <lb/>
his own happiness and that of a worthier woman.</p>
<p>"There were many generous pleas by which my cousin <lb/>
might have accounted for her conduct; she knew that the <lb/>
marriage he offered would never be crowned with her <lb/>
father's consent; that, on the contrary, his hatred and <reg orig="ven-|geance">vengeance</reg> <lb/>
would pursue them for ever; that Wilmot would <lb/>
thereby forfeit the honor already plighted to another&mdash;would <lb/>
inflict exquisite misery on that other and on himself, and <lb/>
would for ever cut himself off from that road to fortune <lb/>
which had now been opened to him.</p>
<p>"She was candid enough to confess that these <reg orig="considera-|tions">considerations</reg>, <lb/>
though powerful, did not singly dictate her conduct. <lb/>
Her heart was in reality full of grief&mdash;despondency and <reg orig="hor-|ror">horror</reg> <lb/>
took possession of her whole soul. She hoped to <reg orig="pro-|tract">protract</reg> <lb/>
the discovery of her personal condition to a very late <lb/>
period, and then, when further concealment was hopeless, <lb/>
designed to put a violent end to life and all its cares.</p>
<p>"Meanwhile, Wilmot's conscience being somewhat <reg orig="re-|lieved">relieved</reg> <lb/>
by my cousin's answer, he gave himself up without <lb/>
restraint to the pleasurable prospects before him. The day <lb/>
of happiness was near at hand; he had little leisure for any <lb/>
thing but the offices of love and tenderness, and was engaged <lb/>
on the evening of a fine day to accompany his mistress, with <lb/>
<pb n="84" entity="eaf033v5_0353" pid="uva-lib:350619"/>
a numerous party, on a rural excursion. The carriage, <lb/>
ready to receive them, was at the door, and he only waited <lb/>
in a court before the house till the lady had adjusted her <lb/>
dress for the occasion.</p>
<p>"His mistress, Adela, having made the requisite <reg orig="adjust-|ments">adjustments</reg>, <lb/>
came out. She looked around for her lover in vain. <lb/>
Some accident, it was easily imagined, had called him for a <lb/>
few moments away. She collected patience to wait; but <lb/>
she waited and expected in vain&mdash;night came, and one day <lb/>
succeeded another, but Wilmot did not appear. Inquiries <lb/>
were set on foot, and messengers were despatched, but <reg orig="Wil-|mot">Wilmot</reg> <lb/>
had entirely vanished.</p>
<p>"Some intelligence was at last gained of him. It <reg orig="appear-|ed">appeared</reg>, <lb/>
that while walking to and fro in the court, two persons <lb/>
had come up to him, and after a short dialogue had retired <lb/>
with him to an inn; there they had been closeted for a few <lb/>
minutes, after which they came forth, and mounting horses <lb/>
that stood at the gate, hastily left the city together.</p>
<p>"The suspense and anxiety which this circumstance <reg orig="pro-|duced">produced</reg> <lb/>
in the lady and her family, may be easily imagined. <lb/>
Their conjectures wandered from one object to another, <lb/>
without obtaining satisfaction&mdash;they could gain, from all their <lb/>
inquiries, no knowledge of the persons who had summoned <lb/>
the young man away&mdash;they inferred that the messengers <lb/>
were the bearers of no good tidings, since the attendants at <lb/>
the inn reported that Wilmot's countenance and motions <reg orig="be-|trayed">betrayed</reg> <lb/>
the utmost consternation, on descending from the <lb/>
chamber where the conference was held.</p>
<p>"Their suspense was at length terminated by the return <lb/>
of the fugitive himself. Wan, sorrowful, and drooping, a <lb/>
horseman languidly alighted about ten days after Wilmot's <lb/>
disappearance at the gate&mdash;it was Wilmot himself. The <lb/>
family flocked about, eager to express their joy, terror, and <lb/>
surprise. He received their greetings with affected <reg orig="cheer-|fulness">cheerfulness</reg>; <lb/>
but presently requesting an interview with Adela, <lb/>
retired with her to her closet.</p>
<p>"I suppose, my dear, you conjecture the true cause of all <lb/>
these appearances. My cousin's secret was betrayed by an <lb/>
unfaithful confidant to her father, whose rage at the <reg orig="discove-|ry">discovery</reg> <lb/>
was without bounds. He rushed into his daughter's <lb/>
presence in a transport of fury, and easily extorted from her <lb/>
<pb n="85" entity="eaf033v5_0354" pid="uva-lib:350620"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">8*</fw></pb>
the author of her disgrace. Without a moment's delay, he <lb/>
ordered horses, and, in company with a friend, made all <lb/>
possible haste to Boulogne. The daughter's uncertainty as <lb/>
to the cause and object of his journey, was ended by the <reg orig="re-|turn">return</reg> <lb/>
of Mr. Lisle in company with Wilmot. The <reg orig="alterna-|tive">alternative</reg> <lb/>
offered to the youth, was to meet the father with pistols, <lb/>
or to repair his child's dishonor by marriage. Mr. Lisle's <lb/>
impetuosity overbore all my cousin's opposition, and Wilmot, <lb/>
the moment he discovered her true situation, was willing to <lb/>
repair the wrong to the utmost of his power.</p>
<p>"The ceremony being performed, Mr. Lisle's pride was <lb/>
so far satisfied; but his rage demanded nothing less than <lb/>
eternal separation from his daughter. Wilmot was obliged <lb/>
to procure lodgings in a different quarter, and my poor <lb/>
cousin left her father's presence, for the last time, with his <lb/>
curses ringing in her ears.</p>
<p>"The horror occasioned by these events brought on a <lb/>
premature labor, the fruit of which did not perish, as might <lb/>
have been expected, but has survived to this day, and is no <lb/>
other than your Mary Wilmot.</p>
<p>"Poor Wilmot had an arduous office still to perform; <lb/>
these events, and his new condition, were to be disclosed to <lb/>
Adela. This it was easy to do by letter; but he rather <lb/>
chose to do full justice to his feelings in a formal interview; <lb/>
and this was the purpose for which he returned to Boulogne.</p>
<p>"It is not possible to imagine a more deplorable situation <lb/>
than that in which Wilmot was now placed; he was torn <lb/>
for ever from the object of his dearest affections; at the <reg orig="mo-|ment">moment</reg> <lb/>
when all obstacles were about to disappear, and a few <lb/>
days were to unite those hearts which had cherished a <reg orig="mu-|tual">mutual</reg> <lb/>
passion from infancy, he was compelled to pay the forfeit <lb/>
of past transgressions, by binding himself to one who had his <lb/>
esteem, but not his love. Adela was the pride and delight <lb/>
of her family, and Wilmot had made himself scarcely a less <lb/>
fervent interest in their affections; that privilege he was now <lb/>
compelled to resign, and by the same act, to break the heart <lb/>
of the daughter, and excite unextinguishable animosity in the <lb/>
bosom of her friends. Every tie dear to the human heart <lb/>
was now violently broken&mdash;every flattering scheme of honor <lb/>
and fortune baffled and defeated; nor had he the <reg orig="consola-|tion">consolation</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="86" entity="eaf033v5_0355" pid="uva-lib:350621"/>
to reflect, that by these sacrifices he had secured the <lb/>
happiness of at least one human being. My cousin was an <lb/>
involuntary actor in this scene; she had been overborne by <lb/>
her father's menaces, and even by the expostulations and <lb/>
entreaties of Wilmot himself. The irrevocable ceremony <lb/>
was hurried over without a moment's deliberation or delay, <lb/>
and before she had time to collect her thoughts and form her <lb/>
resolutions, to recover from the first confusions of surprise <lb/>
and affright, she found herself a wife and a mother.</p>
<p>"It was, perhaps, merely the very conduct which my <lb/>
cousin's feelings taught her to pursue, that secured her <reg orig="ulti-|mately">ultimately</reg> <lb/>
some portion of happiness. All the fault of the first <lb/>
transgression she imputed to herself; Wilmot was the <reg orig="inno-|cent">innocent</reg> <lb/>
and injured person; she only was the injurer and <reg orig="crimi-|nal">criminal</reg>. <lb/>
Those upbraidings which the anguish of his heart <lb/>
might have prompted him to use, were anticipated, dwelt <lb/>
upon, and exaggerated; all the miseries of this alliance <reg orig="pass-|ed">passed</reg> <lb/>
in as vivid hues before her imagination, as before his. <lb/>
These images plunged her into the most profound and <reg orig="pitia-|ble">pitiable</reg> <lb/>
sorrow.</p>
<p>"Wilmot's generosity would by no means admit that her's <lb/>
only was the guilt; on the contrary, his candor, awakened by <lb/>
her example, was busy in aggravating his own crime. His <lb/>
heart was touched by the proofs of her extreme dejection&mdash; <lb/>
her disinterested regard; he reflected that her portion of evil <lb/>
was at least equal to his own. Her sensibility to reputation, <lb/>
her sense of right, her dependence on her father for the <lb/>
means of subsistence, her attachment to her country and <lb/>
kindred, all contributed to heighten her peculiar calamity, <lb/>
since she believed her fame to be blasted forever; since <lb/>
her conscience reproached her with all the guilt of their <lb/>
intercourse; since her father had sworn never to treat her <lb/>
as his child; since she had lost, in her own opinion, the <lb/>
esteem of all her relations and friends, and solemnly vowed <lb/>
never to set foot in her native country.</p>
<p>"Wilmot's efforts to console his wife produced insensibly, <lb/>
a salutary effect on his own feelings. Being obliged to <lb/>
search out topics of comfort for her use, they were equally <lb/>
conducive to his own, and a habit of regarding objects on <lb/>
their brightest side&mdash;of considering my cousin as merely a <lb/>
<pb n="87" entity="eaf033v5_0356" pid="uva-lib:350622"/>
subject of tenderness and compassion, somewhat blunted the <lb/>
edge of his own misfortunes.</p>
<p>"My father took infinite, though unsolicited, pains to <lb/>
reconcile the parent and child; but my uncle could not be <lb/>
prevailed on to do more than allow Wilmot a small annuity, <lb/>
with which he retired to the town of Nice, and by a recluse <lb/>
and frugal life, subsisted, if not with elegance, at least with <lb/>
comfort. Mary Anne was extremely backward to cultivate <lb/>
the society of her old friends; their good offices she took <lb/>
pains to repel and elude, and her only source of consolation <lb/>
with regard to them, appeared to be the hope that they had <lb/>
entirely forgotten her. We, her cousins, were not, however, <lb/>
deterred by her repulses, but did every thing in our power <lb/>
to befriend her cause with her inexorable father, and to <reg orig="im-|prove">improve</reg> <lb/>
her domestic situation. We had the pleasure to find <lb/>
that Wilmot, though his vivacity, his ambitious and <reg orig="enter-|prising">enterprising</reg> <lb/>
spirit was flown, was an affectionate husband and <reg orig="pro-|vident">provident</reg> <lb/>
father.</p>
<p>"At my uncle's death we had hopes that Mary Anne's <lb/>
situation would be bettered. His will, however, bequeathed <lb/>
all his estate to his nephew, my elder brother; and the <reg orig="Wil-|mots">Wilmots</reg> <lb/>
were deprived even of that slender stipend which they <lb/>
had hitherto enjoyed. This injustice was in some degree <reg orig="re-|paired">repaired</reg> <lb/>
by my brother, who, as soon as the affairs of the <reg orig="de-|ceased">deceased</reg> <lb/>
were arranged, sent a very large present to Wilmot. <lb/>
They did not make us acquainted with the motives of their <lb/>
new resolutions; we were merely informed indirectly, that <lb/>
on the receipt of this sum, Wilmot repaired with his family to <lb/>
some port in France, and embarked for the colonies. Time <lb/>
insensibly wore away the memory of these transactions, and <lb/>
'tis a long time since my sisters and I have been accustomed, <lb/>
in reviewing past events, to inquire&mdash;`What has become of <lb/>
poor Mrs. Wilmot and her children?"</p>
<p>Such, Philip, was my mother's relation; is it not an <reg orig="affect-|ing">affecting</reg> <lb/>
one?&mdash;And is, indeed, thy Mary the remnant of this <lb/>
family? They had several children, but most of them <lb/>
found an early grave in Europe, and the eldest, it seems, is <lb/>
the sole survivor. We must make haste, my friend, to raise <lb/>
her from obscurity, and make her happy.</p>
<p>Is it not likely that Mary knows nothing of her mother's <lb/>
history?&mdash;Being only ten years old at her death, the child <lb/>
<pb n="88" entity="eaf033v5_0357" pid="uva-lib:350623"/>
would scarcely be made the confidant of such transactions. <lb/>
The father, it is likely, would be equally prone to silence on <lb/>
such a topic.</p>
<p>Our fortune is strongly influenced by our ignorance.&mdash; <lb/>
What can be more lonely and forlorn than the life thy poor <lb/>
friend has led? Yet had she returned to her mother's native <lb/>
country, and disclosed her relation to the present mistress of <lb/>
Littlelisle, she would have been instantly admitted to the <lb/>
house and bosom of a fond mother.</p>
<p>My uncle, to whom I told you the estate of Mary's <reg orig="grand-|father">grandfather</reg> <lb/>
was bequeathed, died unmarried, and left his property <lb/>
to the sister who was the intimate of Mary Anne, and who <lb/>
never lost the tenderest respect for her youthful friend. This <lb/>
happened some years after Wilmot's voyage to the colonies. <lb/>
My aunt being childless and a widow, was extremely <reg orig="solicit-|ous">solicitous</reg> <lb/>
to discover Mary Anne's retreat, and restore her, or <lb/>
her children, to at least a part of that property, to the whole <lb/>
of which their title was, strictly speaking, better than her <lb/>
own; for this end, she made a great many inquiries in <reg orig="Ame-|rica">America</reg>, <lb/>
but none of them met with success.</p>
<p>I have written a long letter; yet I could add much more, <lb/>
were I not afraid of losing this post, so let me hear thy <reg orig="com-|ments">comments</reg> <lb/>
on all these particulars, and tell me, especially, when <lb/>
I may certainly expect thy return. Adieu.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Thanks,</hi> a thousand thanks, my beloved friend, for thy <lb/>
story. It has absorbed and overwhelmed every other thought <lb/>
and feeling. Since I received it, I have done nothing but <lb/>
peruse and ponder on thy letter; it has opened cheerful <lb/>
prospects for my poor friend. Shall we not see her restored <lb/>
to her native country, to her original rank, and the affluence <lb/>
to which she is entitled by her birth, her education, and her <lb/>
former sufferings? I trust we shall.</p>

</opener>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">By</hi> the calm tenor of this letter, you will hardly judge of <lb/>
the state of my mind before I sat down to write. To <reg orig="de-|scribe">describe</reg> <lb/>
it would be doing wrong to myself and to you; I am <lb/>
not anxious to pass for better than I am; to hide my <reg orig="weak-|ness">weakness</reg>, <lb/>
or to dwell upon my folly. In this letter to paint the <lb/>
struggles between reason and passion, would be making more <lb/>
arduous that task which I must assign to you.</p>
<p>I have formerly concealed these struggles; my motive was <lb/>
not shame. I aimed not to shun contempt by concealing my <lb/>
defects, for, alas! the spirit with which I had to deal <reg orig="model-|led">modelled</reg> <lb/>
his opinions by a standard different from mine; that <lb/>
which was selfish and base in my eyes, was praise worthy <lb/>
in his. I passed for obdurate and absurd, in proportion as I <lb/>
acted in a manner which appeared to me generous and just.</p>
<p>I concealed these struggles, because I hated to reflect <lb/>
upon my own faults; because they were past, and the better <lb/>
thoughts that succeeded were sources of complacency too <lb/>
precious to be lost, and attained and preserved with so much <lb/>
difficulty, that to review the conflicts which it cost me to gain <lb/>
them, would hazard their loss.</p>
<p>Thus it is at present. I write to you not to give utterance <lb/>
and new existence to anguish no longer felt; I write to you <lb/>
to tell my present views, and they cannot waver or change.</p>
<p>My friend, the bearer of this, is your Mary. She is not <lb/>
happy&mdash;she is not another's! She is poor, but good; and <lb/>
no doubt as much devoted to you as ever. Need I point out <lb/>
to you the road which you ought to take?&mdash;Need I enforce <lb/>
<pb n="90" entity="eaf033v5_0359" pid="uva-lib:350625"/>
by arguments that duty which compels you to consult her <lb/>
happiness, by every honest means?</p>
<p>Could I but inspire you, my friend, with the sentiments <lb/>
that now possess my heart; could I but make your <reg orig="convic-|tions">convictions</reg> <lb/>
at once just and strong, and convert you into a cheerful <lb/>
performer of your duty, I should indeed be happy.</p>
<p>You will wonder by what means Mary has been made <lb/>
known to me. I will tell you. I went to pay a visit, long <lb/>
since due, to Mrs. Etheridge&mdash;it was but yesterday. After <lb/>
a cursory discourse, she mentioned that she expected in a <lb/>
few minutes to see a lady, who was going on the morrow to <lb/>
Philadelphia. I had written to you, and was not unwilling <lb/>
to make use of this opportunity; "What," I asked, "is her <lb/>
name, her character, her situation?"</p>
<p>"Mary Wilmot; she has just come from New Haven, <lb/>
where she has passed the winter with a friend. She is <reg orig="amia-|ble">amiable</reg>, <lb/>
but unfortunate."</p>
<p>You will imagine with what emotions I listened to these <lb/>
words. For some minutes I was too much surprised to think <lb/>
or to speak clearly. My companion noticed my emotion, <lb/>
but before she could inquire into the cause, a visitant was <lb/>
announced, and Miss Wilmot herself entered the room. <lb/>
Being introduced to each other, my name occasioned as <lb/>
much surprise and embarrassment as her's had given to me. <lb/>
The interview ended abruptly; but not till I had so far <reg orig="col-|lected">collected</reg> <lb/>
my thoughts as to request her to be the bearer of a <lb/>
letter. She mentioned the place where it might be left, and <lb/>
we parted.</p>
<p>I ought to have acted in a different manner&mdash;I ought to <lb/>
have asked her company home; have sought her <reg orig="confi-|dence">confidence</reg>; <lb/>
have unbosomed myself to her, and removed every <lb/>
obstacle to her union with you, which might arise from an <lb/>
erring judgment or an unwise generosity.</p>
<p>But I was unfitted for this by the suddenness of our <reg orig="inter-|view">interview</reg>. <lb/>
I had not time to subdue those trembling and mixed <lb/>
feelings which the sight of her produced, before she <reg orig="with-|drew">withdrew</reg>; <lb/>
and I had not courage enough to visit her at her <lb/>
lodgings, and be the bearer of my own letter. So much <lb/>
the more arduous is the task which belongs to you; my <lb/>
deficiencies must be supplied by you. Act uprightly and <lb/>
ingenuously, my friend, I entreat you; seek her presence, <lb/>
<pb n="91" entity="eaf033v5_0360" pid="uva-lib:350626"/>
and shew her this and every other letter from me; offer <lb/>
her&mdash;beseech her&mdash;compel her to accept your vows.</p>
<p>Accuse me not of fickleness; acquit me of mean and <lb/>
ungenerous behavior. Dream not that reasoning or <reg orig="en-|treaty">entreaty</reg> <lb/>
will effect any change in my present sentiments. I <lb/>
love you, Philip, as I ought to love you&mdash;I love your <reg orig="hap-|piness&mdash;your">happiness&mdash;your</reg> <lb/>
virtue. I resign you to this good girl, as to <lb/>
one who deserves you more than I; whose happiness is <lb/>
more dependent on the affections of another than mine is. <lb/>
What passion is now wanting in you, time will shortly <reg orig="sup-|ply">supply</reg>. <lb/>
In such a case, you must and will act and feel as you <lb/>
ought.</p>
<p>Let me not hear from you till you have seen her. I know <lb/>
whence will arise the failure of your efforts on such an <reg orig="inter-|view">interview</reg>. <lb/>
If she withstand your eloquence, it will be because <lb/>
you have betrayed your cause, or because she acts from a <lb/>
romantic and groundless generosity with regard to me. The <lb/>
last obstacle, it will be my province to remove; I will write <lb/>
to her, and convince her that by rejecting you on my account, <lb/>
she does me injury and not benefit, and is an enemy to your <lb/>
happiness; for while Mary lives, and is not bound to <reg orig="an-|other">another</reg>, <lb/>
I will never be to you any thing but</p>

<salute>MY FRIEND,</salute>
</opener>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">I do</hi> not mean to reason with you. When I tell you that <lb/>
you are wrong, I am far from expecting your assent to my <lb/>
assertion. I say it not in a tone of bitterness or <reg orig="depreca-|tion">deprecation</reg>; <lb/>
I am calm, in this respect, as yourself; there is nothing <lb/>
to ruffle my calm. We fluctuate and are impatient only <lb/>
when doubtful of the future. Our fate being sealed, and an <lb/>
end being put to suspense and to doubt, the passions are <lb/>
still&mdash;sedateness and tranquillity at least are ours.</p>
<p>There is nothing, I repeat, to ruffle my calm. I am not <lb/>
<pb n="92" entity="eaf033v5_0361" pid="uva-lib:350627"/>
angry with you, for I know the purity and rectitude of your <lb/>
motives&mdash;your judgment only is misguided; but that is no <lb/>
source of impatience or repining to me; it is beyond my <lb/>
power, or that of time, to rectify your error.</p>
<p>I do not pity you. You aspire to true happiness, the gift <lb/>
of self-approbation and of virtuous forbearance. You have <lb/>
adopted the means necessary to this end, and the end is <lb/>
gained&mdash;why then should I pity you?&mdash;You would not <lb/>
derive more happiness from a different decision. Another <lb/>
would indeed be more happy, but you would perhaps be <lb/>
less; at any rate, your enjoyments would not be greater <lb/>
than they now are, for what gratification can be compared <lb/>
to that arising from the sense of doing as we ought?</p>
<p>I believe you in the wrong, and I tell you so. It is <reg orig="pro-|per">proper</reg> <lb/>
that the truth should be known; it is proper that my <lb/>
opinion, and the grounds of it, should be known to you; <lb/>
not that after this disclosure you will think or act differently; <lb/>
of that I have not the least hope.</p>
<p>You are wrong, Clara; you study, it seems, the good of <lb/>
others; you desire the benefit of this girl, and since her <lb/>
happiness lies in being united to me, and in possessing my <lb/>
affections, you wish to unite us, and to transfer to her my <lb/>
love.</p>
<p>It cannot be done; marry her I may, but I shall not love <lb/>
her&mdash;I cannot love her. This incapacity, you will think, <lb/>
argues infirmity and vice in me, and lessens me in your <lb/>
esteem. It ought not to produce this effect; it is a proof of <lb/>
neither wickedness nor folly. I cannot love her, because <lb/>
my affections are already devoted to one more attractive and <lb/>
more excellent than she.</p>
<p>She has my reverence; if wedlock unites us, my fidelity <lb/>
will never be broken. I will watch over her safety with <lb/>
unfailing solicitude; she shall share every feeling and <lb/>
thought; the ties of the tenderest friendship shall be her's, <lb/>
but&mdash;nothing more.</p>
<p>You will say that more is due to her; that a just man <lb/>
will add to every office of a friend the sanction of ineffable <lb/>
passion. I will not discuss with you the propriety of loving <lb/>
my wife, when her moral and intellectual excellence is <reg orig="un-|questionable">unquestionable</reg>, <lb/>
and when all her love is bestowed upon me. <lb/>
I will only repeat, that passion will never be felt.</p>
<pb n="93" entity="eaf033v5_0362" pid="uva-lib:350628"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">9</fw></pb>
<p>What then will be the fruit of marriage? Nothing but <lb/>
wo to her whom you labor, by uniting us, to make happy. <lb/>
You rely, however, on the influence of time and intercourse <lb/>
to beget that passion which is now wanting. And think you <lb/>
that this girl will wed a man who loves her not?</p>
<p>She never will. Our union is impracticable, not from <lb/>
opposition or refusal on my side, but on hers. As to me, <lb/>
my concurrence shall be full, cheerful, zealous; argument <lb/>
and importunity will not be wanting. If they fail, you will <lb/>
ascribe their failure to my coldness, ambiguity, or artifice, <lb/>
or to mistaken generosity in her with regard to you. The <lb/>
last motive, after due representations, will not exist&mdash;the <lb/>
former cause may possess some influence, for I shall act with <lb/>
scrupulous sincerity. I shall counterfeit no passion and no <lb/>
warmth; the simple and unembellished truth shall be told <lb/>
to her, and this, I know, will be an insurmountable <reg orig="impedi-|ment">impediment</reg>.</p>
<p>But suppose, for a moment, this obstacle to disappear, <lb/>
and that Mary is happy as the wife of one who esteems her <lb/>
indeed, but loves her not. Your end is accomplished&mdash;you <lb/>
proceed to reap the fruits of disinterested virtue, and <reg orig="con-|template">contemplate</reg> <lb/>
the felicity which is your own work.</p>
<p>This girl is the only one of God's creatures worthy of <lb/>
benevolence; no other is entitled to the sacrifice of your <lb/>
inclination. None there are in whose happiness you find a <lb/>
recompense for evils and privations befalling yourself.</p>
<p>As to me, I am an inert and insensible atom, or I move <lb/>
in so remote a sphere that my pains or pleasures are <reg orig="inde-|pendent">independent</reg> <lb/>
of any will or exertion of yours. But no; that is <lb/>
a dignity of which I must not boast. I am so far sunk into <lb/>
depravity, that all my desires are the instigations of guilt, <lb/>
and all my pleasures those of iniquity. Duty tells you to <lb/>
withstand and to thwart, not to gratify my wishes.</p>
<p>I love you, and my happiness depends upon your favor. <lb/>
Without you, or with another, I can know no joy; but this, <lb/>
in your opinion, is folly and perverseness; to aspire to your <lb/>
favor, when it is beyond my reach, is criminal infatuation; <lb/>
not to love her who loves me, and whose happiness depends <lb/>
upon my love, is, you think, cruel and unjust. Be it so; <lb/>
great indeed is my demerit. Worthless and depraved am <lb/>
<pb n="94" entity="eaf033v5_0363" pid="uva-lib:350629"/>
I, but not single in iniquity and wretchedness; for the rule <lb/>
is fallacious that is not applicable to all others in the same <lb/>
circumstances. That conduct which in me is culpable, <lb/>
is no less culpable in others. Am I cruel and unjust in <lb/>
refusing my love to one that claims it? So are you, whose <lb/>
refusal is no less obstinate as to me, as mine with respect to <lb/>
another; and who hearkens not to claims upon your <reg orig="sympa-|thy">sympathy</reg>, <lb/>
as reasonable as those of Mary on mine.</p>
<p>And how is it that Miss Wilmot's merits tower so far above <lb/>
mine? By placing her happiness in gaining affections which <lb/>
are obstinately withheld; by sacrificing the duty she owes <lb/>
herself, her fellow-creatures, and her God, to grief, <reg orig="be-|cause">because</reg> <lb/>
the capricious feelings of another have chosen a <reg orig="dif-|ferent">different</reg> <lb/>
object of devotion, does she afford no proof of <reg orig="infatua-|tion">infatuation</reg> <lb/>
and perverseness? Is she not at least sunk to a level <lb/>
with me?</p>
<p>But Mary Wilmot and I are not the only persons affected <lb/>
by your decision&mdash;there is another more entitled to the <reg orig="af-|fections">affections</reg> <lb/>
of this woman than I, because he loves her; <reg orig="be-|cause">because</reg>, <lb/>
in spite of coldness, poverty, and personal defects; <lb/>
in spite of repulse from her, the aversion of his family, and <lb/>
the inticements of those to whom his birth, fortune, and <reg orig="ex-|terior">exterior</reg> <lb/>
accomplishments have made him desirable, continues <lb/>
to love her. With regard to this man, is she not exactly in <lb/>
the same relation as I am to her? Is it not her duty to <lb/>
consult his happiness, and no longer oppose his laudable and <lb/>
generous wishes? For him and for me your benevolence <lb/>
sleeps; with regard to us, you have neither consideration <lb/>
nor humanity; they are all absorbed in the cause of one <lb/>
whose merits, whose claim to your sympathy and aid, if it <lb/>
be not less, is far from being greater than Sedley's or mine.</p>
<p>My path is indeed plain; I mean to visit Miss Wilmot; <lb/>
but before I see her, I shall transmit to her all the letters <lb/>
that have passed between you and me on this subject, and <lb/>
particularly a copy of this. She shall not be deceived; <lb/>
she shall judge with all the materials of a right judgment <lb/>
before her. I am prepared to devote myself to her will&mdash; <lb/>
to join my fate to her's tomorrow. I do not fear any <reg orig="less-|ening">lessening</reg> <lb/>
of my reverence for her virtues, of that tenderness <lb/>
which will be her due, and which it becomes him to feel in <lb/>
whose hands is deposited the weal or wo of a woman truly <lb/>
<pb n="95" entity="eaf033v5_0364" pid="uva-lib:350630"/>
excellent. We have wherewith to secure the blessings of <lb/>
competence; with that we will seek the shores of the Ohio, <lb/>
and devote ourselves to rural affairs. You and yours I shall <lb/>
strive to forget&mdash;justice to my wife and to myself will <reg orig="re-|quire">require</reg> <lb/>
this at my hand. Adieu.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">I sit</hi> down to relate what, perhaps, will afford you pain <lb/>
instead of pleasure. I know not whether I ought to give <lb/>
you pain by this recital. Having no longer the power of <lb/>
living for my own happiness, I had wrought up my mind to <lb/>
the fervent wish of living for the sake of another. I found <lb/>
consolation in the thought of being useful to a human being.</p>
<p>Now my condition is forlorn and dreary. That sedate <lb/>
<pb n="96" entity="eaf033v5_0365" pid="uva-lib:350631"/>
and mixed kind of happiness on which I had set my wishes <lb/>
is denied me. My last hope, meagre and poor as it was, is <lb/>
extinguished for ever. The fire that glowed in my bosom <lb/>
languishes; I am like one let loose upon a perilous sea, <lb/>
without rudder or sail.</p>
<p>I have made preparations to leave this city tomorrow by <lb/>
the dawn of day, on a journey from which I neither wish <lb/>
nor expect to return. I at this moment anticipate the dawn <lb/>
of comfort from the scenes of the wilderness and of savage <lb/>
life; I begin to adopt, with seriousness, a plan which has <lb/>
often occurred to my juvenile reveries.</p>
<p>In my uncle's parlor there hangs a rude outline of the <lb/>
continent of North America; many an hour have I gazed <lb/>
upon it, and indulged in that romantic love of enterprise for <lb/>
which I have ever been distinguished. My eye used to <lb/>
leap from the shore of Ontario, to the obscure rivulets which <lb/>
form, by their conflux, the Alleghany. This have I pursued <lb/>
through all its windings, till its stream was lost in that of the <lb/>
Ohio. Along this river have I steered and paddled my <lb/>
canoe of bark many hundreds of leagues, till the Mississippi <lb/>
was attained. Down that mighty current I allowed myself <lb/>
to be passively borne, till the mouths of the Missouri opened <lb/>
to my view. A more arduous task, and one hitherto <reg orig="unat-|tempted">unattempted</reg>, <lb/>
then remained for me; in the ardors of my fancy, <lb/>
all perils and hardships were despised, and I boldly <reg orig="adven-|tured">adventured</reg> <lb/>
to struggle against the current of Missouri, to combat <lb/>
the dangers of an untried navigation, of hostile tribes, and <lb/>
unknown regions.</p>
<p>Having gained the remotest sources of the river, I <reg orig="pro-|ceeded">proceeded</reg> <lb/>
to drag my barque over mountains and rocks, <lb/>
till I lighted upon the valleys and streams that tend to the <lb/>
north and west. On one of these I again embarked. The <lb/>
rivulets insensibly swelled into majestic streams; lurking <lb/>
sands and overhanging cliffs gradually disappeared, and a <lb/>
river flowed beneath me, as spacious in its breadth and <lb/>
depth, and wandering through as many realms, as the Wolga <lb/>
or the Oronoco. After a tedious navigation of two thousand <lb/>
miles, I at last entered a bay of the ocean, and descried the <lb/>
shores of the great Pacific. This purpose being gained, I <lb/>
was little anxious to return, and allowed my fancy to range <lb/>
at will over the boundless field of contingencies, by some of <lb/>
<pb n="97" entity="eaf033v5_0366" pid="uva-lib:350632"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">9*</fw></pb>
which I might be transported across the ocean to China, or <lb/>
along the coast to the dominions of the Spaniards.</p>
<p>This scheme, suspended and forgotten for a while, I have <lb/>
now resumed. Tomorrow I go hence, in company with a <lb/>
person who holds a high rank in the Spanish districts <reg orig="west-|ward">westward</reg> <lb/>
of the Mississippi.</p>
<p>You will not receive this letter, or be apprised of my <reg orig="in-|tentions">intentions</reg>, <lb/>
till after I am gone. I shall despatch it at the <lb/>
moment of my leaving this city. I shall not write to Mr. <lb/>
Howard; I want not his aid or his counsel. I know that <lb/>
his views are very different from mine. I shall awaken <lb/>
opposition and remonstrance, which will answer no end but <lb/>
to give me torment and inquietude. To you I leave the <lb/>
task of informing him of my destiny, or allow him, if you <lb/>
please, to be wholly unacquainted with it&mdash;either conduct is <lb/>
indifferent to me.</p>
<p>But there is one in whose welfare you condescend to take <lb/>
some interest, and of whom I am able to communicate some <lb/>
tidings. Some commands which you laid upon me in <reg orig="re-|lation">relation</reg> <lb/>
to Mary have been fulfilled, and I shall now acquaint <lb/>
you with the result.</p>
<p>She sent me your letter not many hours after it was <reg orig="writ-|ten">written</reg>, <lb/>
with a note informing me of her place of abode, and <lb/>
requesting a meeting with me. A letter from you by her <lb/>
hands, was a cause of sufficient wonder; but the contents of <lb/>
your letter were far more wonderful than the mode of its <lb/>
conveyance.&mdash;The handwriting assured me it was yours; <lb/>
the style and sentiments were alien to all that my fancy had <lb/>
connected with your name. With these tokens of profound <lb/>
indifference to my happiness, of ineffable contempt for my <lb/>
person and character, I compared the solicitude and <reg orig="tender-|ness">tenderness</reg> <lb/>
which your preceding letter had breathed, and was <lb/>
utterly lost in horror and doubt. But this is not the strain <lb/>
in which I ought to write to you. Reason should set my <lb/>
happiness beyond the love or enmity of another, not wiser <lb/>
or more discerning or benevolent than myself. If reason be <lb/>
inadequate to my deliverance, pride should hinder me from <lb/>
disclosing my humiliation&mdash;from confessing my voluntary <lb/>
servitude.</p>
<p>After my discomposure was somewhat abated, I proceeded <lb/>
<pb n="98" entity="eaf033v5_0367" pid="uva-lib:350633"/>
to reflect on what was now to be done. Compliance with <lb/>
your dictates was obvious; since I was no longer of <reg orig="import-|ance">importance</reg> <lb/>
to your happiness, it was time to remember what was <lb/>
due to that angelic sufferer.</p>
<p>I have already told you that I sent your letters, and <reg orig="pro-|mised">promised</reg> <lb/>
to see her in the evening. I went at the appointed hour. <lb/>
I entered her apartment with a throbbing heart, for she is <lb/>
my friend. Near a year had passed since I had last seen her; <lb/>
this interval had been tormented with doubts of her safety, <lb/>
of her happiness, of her virtue, and even her existence. <lb/>
These doubts were removed, or about to be solved; my own <lb/>
eyes were to bear testimony to the truth of her existence.</p>
<p>I was admitted to her; I hastened to communicate my <lb/>
wishes; I enforced them by all the eloquence that I was <lb/>
master of, but my eloquence was powerless. She was too <lb/>
blind an admirer, and assiduous a follower of Clara Howard, <lb/>
to accept my proffers. I abruptly withdrew.</p>
<p>Heaven protect thee and her! I shall carry, I fear, the <lb/>
images of both of you along with me. Their company will <lb/>
not be friendly to courage or constancy. I shall shut them <lb/>
out as soon as I can,</p>

</opener>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">I feel</hi> some reluctance and embarrassment in addressing <lb/>
you in this manner; but am enabled, in some degree, to <lb/>
surmount them, by reflecting on the proofs which are now <lb/>
in my hands, of the interest which you take in my welfare, <lb/>
and of the inimitable generosity of your sentiments. I am <lb/>
likewise stimulated by the regard, which, in common with <lb/>
yourself, I feel for an excellent youth, to whose happiness <lb/>
this letter may essentially contribute.</p>
<p>I have seen you but for a moment. I was prepared to <lb/>
find in you all that could inspire veneration and love. That <lb/>
my prepossessions, were fully verified, will perhaps redound <lb/>
<pb n="99" entity="eaf033v5_0368" pid="uva-lib:350634"/>
little to the credit of my penetration or your beauty, since <lb/>
we seldom fail to discover in the features, tokens of all that <lb/>
we imagine to exist within.</p>
<p>I know you by more copious and satisfactory means; by <lb/>
several letters which Philip Stanley has put into my hands. <lb/>
By these it likewise appears that you have some <reg orig="acquaint-|ance">acquaintance</reg> <lb/>
with me, collected from the same source, and from <lb/>
the representations of my friend. The character and <reg orig="situa-|tion">situation</reg>, <lb/>
the early history and unfortunate attachment of Mary, <lb/>
and that expedient which she adopted to free herself from <lb/>
useless importunities and repinings, are already known to you.</p>
<p>This makes it needless for me to mention many <reg orig="partic-|ulars">particulars</reg> <lb/>
of my early life; they authorize the present letter, and <lb/>
allow me, or perhaps, to speak more truly, they enjoin me, to <lb/>
confide in you a relation of some incidents that have lately <lb/>
occurred. Your sensibility would render them of some <lb/>
moment in your eyes, should they possess no relation but <lb/>
to a forlorn and unhappy girl; but their importance will be <lb/>
greater, inasmuch as they are connected with your own <lb/>
destiny, and with that of one whom you justly hold dear. <lb/>
I shall claim your attention for as short a time as possible.</p>
<p>A letter, written last autumn, to Philip Stanley, informing <lb/>
him of the motives that induced me to withdraw from his <lb/>
society, has been shewn to you; it will therefore be needless <lb/>
to explain these motives anew. I console myself with <lb/>
believing, that they merited and obtained the approbation <lb/>
of so enlightened and delicate a judge as Clara Howard.</p>
<p>The place of my retreat was determined by the kind <lb/>
offers and solicitations of a lady, by name Valentine. In <lb/>
other circumstances, similar solicitations from her had been <lb/>
refused; but now I was anxious to retire to a great and <lb/>
unknown distance from my usual home&mdash;to retire without <lb/>
delay; but my health was imperfect. I was a female, <lb/>
without knowledge of the world, without the means of <lb/>
subsistence, and the season was cold and boisterous. Mrs. <lb/>
Valentine was opulent; her character entitled her to <reg orig="confi-|dence">confidence</reg> <lb/>
and love; her engagements required her immediate <lb/>
departure; she would travel with all possible advantages; <lb/>
her new abode was at a great distance from my own; and <lb/>
she meant to continue absent during the ensuing year. <lb/>
There was but one consideration to make me hesitate.</p>
<pb n="100" entity="eaf033v5_0369" pid="uva-lib:350635"/>
<p>Her brother had long offered me his affections. Mrs. <lb/>
Valentine had been his advocate, and endeavored to win my <lb/>
favor, or, at least, to facilitate his own exertions, by <reg orig="promot-|ing">promoting</reg> <lb/>
our intercourse.</p>
<p>I had been hitherto unjust to the merits of this man. His <lb/>
constancy, his generosity, his gifts of person, understanding, <lb/>
and fortune, might have won the heart of a woman less <reg orig="pre-|possessed">prepossessed</reg> <lb/>
in favor of another. My indifference, my <reg orig="aver-|sion">aversion</reg>, <lb/>
were proportioned to that fervent love with which my <lb/>
heart was inspired by another. I thought it my duty to <lb/>
avoid every means by which the impracticable wishes of <lb/>
Sedley might be fostered. For this end, I had hitherto <reg orig="de-|clined">declined</reg> <lb/>
most of those offers of friendship and intercourse <lb/>
with which I had been honored by his sister.</p>
<p>My unhappy situation had now reduced me to the <reg orig="neces-|sity">necessity</reg> <lb/>
of violating some of my maxims. I should never have <lb/>
accompanied Mrs. Valentine, however, had I not been <reg orig="previ-|ously">previously</reg> <lb/>
assured that her brother designed to live at a distance. <lb/>
It was impossible to object to his design of accompanying us <lb/>
to the end of our journey.</p>
<p>That journey was accomplished. We arrived at the eve <lb/>
of winter, in the neighborhood of Boston. The treatment <lb/>
I received from my friend was scrupulously delicate; she <lb/>
acted with the frankness and affection of a sister; but I <lb/>
think with shame on that absurd pride which hindered me <lb/>
from practising the same candor. I was born in an affluent <lb/>
condition; but the misfortunes of my parents, while they <lb/>
trained me up in a thousand prejudices, left me at the age of <lb/>
eighteen totally destitute of property or friends. There was <lb/>
no human being on whom the customs of the world would <lb/>
allow me to depend. My only relation was a younger <lb/>
brother, who was still a boy, and who needed protection as <lb/>
much as myself. In this state, I had recourse for honest <lb/>
bread to my needle; but the bread thus procured was <reg orig="min-|gled">mingled</reg> <lb/>
with many bitter tears. I conceived myself degraded <lb/>
by my labor; my penury was aggravated by remembrance <lb/>
of my former enjoyments. I shrunk from the salutation, or <lb/>
avoided the path of my early companions; I imagined that <lb/>
they would regard my fallen state with contempt, or with <lb/>
pity, no less hard to be endured than scorn. I labored <lb/>
sometimes, by unjustifiable and disingenuous artifices, to <lb/>
<pb n="101" entity="eaf033v5_0370" pid="uva-lib:350636"/>
conceal my employments and my wants, and masked my <lb/>
cares as well as I was able, under cheerful looks.</p>
<p>This spirit led me to conceal from Mrs. Valentine my <reg orig="for-|lorn">forlorn</reg> <lb/>
condition. I looked forward without hope, to the hour <lb/>
when new labor would be requisite to procure for me shelter <lb/>
and food. For these I was at present indebted to my friend; <lb/>
but I loved to regard myself merely as a visitant, and <reg orig="anti-|cipate">anticipate</reg> <lb/>
the time when I should cease to lie under obligation. <lb/>
Meanwhile, there were many little and occasional sources <lb/>
of expense, to which my ill-supplied purse was unequal, <lb/>
while a thousand obstacles existed under this roof, to any <lb/>
profitable application of my time; hence arose new cause of <lb/>
vexation, and new force to my melancholy.</p>
<p>All my stratagems could not conceal from my friend my <lb/>
poverty. For a time she struggled to accommodate herself <lb/>
to my scruples, and to aid me, without seeming to know the <lb/>
extent of my necessities. These struggles were frustrated <lb/>
by my obstinate pride; I steadily refused either money or <lb/>
credit.</p>
<p>At length she resolved to enter into full explanations with <lb/>
me on the subject. She laid before me, with simplicity and <lb/>
candor, all her suspicions and surmises, and finally extorted <lb/>
from me a confession that I was not mistress of a single <reg orig="dol-|lar">dollar</reg> <lb/>
in the world; that I had no kinsman to whom I could <reg orig="be-|take">betake</reg> <lb/>
myself for the supply of my wants; no fund on which <lb/>
I was authorized to draw for a farthing.</p>
<p>This declaration was heard with the strongest emotion. <lb/>
She betrayed surprise and disappointment. After a pause, <lb/>
she expressed her astonishment at this news. She <reg orig="remind-|ed">reminded</reg> <lb/>
me how little it agreed with past appearances. She had <lb/>
known me during the latter part of my brother's life, and <lb/>
since. My brother's profession had apparently been useful <lb/>
to my subsistence, and since his death, though indeed the <lb/>
period had been short, I had lived in a neat seclusion, and at <lb/>
leisure.</p>
<p>These hints induced me to be more frank in my <reg orig="disclo-|sures">disclosures</reg>. <lb/>
I related what is already known to you; the fate of <lb/>
the money which I inherited from my brother, the doubtful <lb/>
circumstances that attended my brother's possession, and <lb/>
the irresistible claims of Morton.</p>
<p>Every word of my narrative added anew to my friend's <lb/>
<pb n="102" entity="eaf033v5_0371" pid="uva-lib:350637"/>
surprise and disappointment. She continued for a long time <lb/>
silent; but much disquiet was betrayed by her looks. I <lb/>
mistook these for signs of disapprobation of my conduct, <lb/>
and began to justify myself.</p>
<p>"Dear Madam, would you not, in my place, have acted <lb/>
in this manner?"</p>
<p>"Just so, Mary; your conclusion was highly plausible."</p>
<p>"I believe my conclusion," replied I, "to be certain. I <lb/>
did not require any stronger proof of Morton's title."</p>
<p>"And yet his claim was fallacious. This money was <lb/>
yours, and only yours."</p>
<p>This assertion was made with a confidence that convinced <lb/>
me of its truth, and caused my mind instantly to adopt a <lb/>
new method of accounting for the acquisition of this money. <lb/>
My eyes, fixed upon my companion, betrayed my suspicion <lb/>
that my benefactress was before me. Humiliation and <reg orig="grati-|tude">gratitude</reg> <lb/>
were mingled in my heart; tears gushed from my eyes <lb/>
while I pressed her hand to my lips.</p>
<p>"Ah!" said I, "if Morton were not the giver, who should <lb/>
know the defects of his title but the real giver?"</p>
<p>"Your gratitude, Mary, is misplaced. You might easily <lb/>
imagine that my funds would never allow me to be liberal <lb/>
to that amount."</p>
<p>"Is it not you? Whose then was the bounteous spirit? <lb/>
You are at least acquainted with the real benefactor."</p>
<p>"I confess that I am; but may not be authorized to <reg orig="dis-|close">disclose</reg> <lb/>
the name."</p>
<p>I besought her to disclose the name.</p>
<p>"The motive," said my friend, "is obvious. It could <lb/>
only be the dread that, knowing your scrupulousness on this <lb/>
head, you would refuse the boon, and thus frustrate a <reg orig="pur-|pose">purpose</reg> <lb/>
truly benevolent. This apprehension being removed, <lb/>
there can certainly be no reason for concealment. I am <reg orig="en-|tirely">entirely</reg> <lb/>
of your opinion, that the author of every good deed <lb/>
should be known not only to the subject of the benefit, but <lb/>
to all mankind."</p>
<p>After much solicitation, she at length confessed that this <lb/>
money was the gift of Mr. Sedley to my brother. She <lb/>
stated the motives of this uncommon liberality. Sedley had <lb/>
made his sister acquainted with his passion for me, and had <lb/>
engaged her counsel and aid. Her counsel had always <lb/>
<pb n="103" entity="eaf033v5_0372" pid="uva-lib:350638"/>
been, to abandon a pursuit where success was hopeless.&mdash; <lb/>
"Perceiving your reluctance," continued my friend, "and <lb/>
finding it to arise from a passion for another, I earnestly <reg orig="dis-|suaded">dissuaded</reg> <lb/>
him from persisting in claims, which were hurtful to <lb/>
you without profiting himself. His passion sometimes led <lb/>
him to accuse you of frowardness and obstinacy; and, at <lb/>
those times, I had much ado to defend you, and to prove <lb/>
your right to consult your own happiness.</p>
<p>"But these moments, I must say, in justice to my brother, <lb/>
were few. I could generally reason him into better temper. <lb/>
He could see, at least for a time, the propriety of ceasing to <lb/>
vex you with entreaties and arguments, and was generous <lb/>
enough to wish you happiness, even with another. This spirit <lb/>
led him to inquire into the character and condition of your <lb/>
chosen friend. For this purpose he cultivated the <reg orig="acquaint-|ance">acquaintance</reg> <lb/>
of your brother, and discovered that the only obstacle <lb/>
to your union with young Stanley, was your mutual poverty. <lb/>
After many struggles, many fits of jealousy and anger, and <lb/>
melancholy, he determined to lay aside every selfish wish, <lb/>
and to remove this obstacle to your happiness, by giving you <lb/>
possession of sufficient property.</p>
<p>"This undertaking was in the highest degree arduous <lb/>
and delicate. To make the offer directly to you was <reg orig="chi-|merical">chimerical</reg>. <lb/>
No power on earth, he well knew, could <reg orig="per-|suade">persuade</reg> <lb/>
you to receive a free gift in money from one whose <reg orig="pre-|tensions">pretensions</reg> <lb/>
had been such as his. To bestow it upon Stanley <lb/>
would be exposing the success of his scheme to hazard; his <lb/>
scruples would be likely to exclaim against such a gift, as <lb/>
loudly as yours, especially when attended with those <reg orig="condi-|tions">conditions</reg> <lb/>
which it would be necessary to prescribe. There was <lb/>
likewise no certainty that his gift might not be diverted by <lb/>
Stanley to other purposes than those which he sought; <lb/>
neither did he wish to insure your marriage with another, <lb/>
upon terms which should appear to lay you under obligations <lb/>
to that other. Besides, your union with Stanley was, in <lb/>
some degree, uncertain; a thousand untoward events might <lb/>
occur to protract or prevent it, whereas your poverty was a <lb/>
present and constant evil.</p>
<p>"After discussing a great number of expedients, he <lb/>
adopted one at length, which perhaps, was as unskilful as <lb/>
any which he could have lighted on. By talking with your <lb/>
<pb n="104" entity="eaf033v5_0373" pid="uva-lib:350639"/>
brother, he found him possessed of a quick, indignant, and <lb/>
lofty spirit; one that recoiled from pecuniary obligations; <lb/>
that placed a kind of glory in being poor; and in devoting <lb/>
his efforts to benevolent, rather than to lucrative purposes. <lb/>
He saw that direct offers of money, to any considerable <lb/>
amount, and accompanied with no conditions, or by <reg orig="condi-|tions">conditions</reg> <lb/>
which respected his sister, would be disdainfully rejected, <lb/>
he determined, therefore, to leave him no option, and to put <lb/>
a certain sum in his possession, without it being possible for <lb/>
him to discover the donor, or to refuse the gift. This sum <lb/>
was therefore sent to him, under cover of a short billet, <reg orig="with-|out">without</reg> <lb/>
signature, and in a disguised hand.</p>
<p>"The scheme was not disclosed to me till after it was <lb/>
executed. I did not approve it; I am no friend to indirect <lb/>
proceedings. I was aware of many accidents that might <lb/>
make this gift a hurtful one, or, at least, useless to the end <lb/>
Sedley proposed. Your brother's scruples, which hindered <lb/>
him from openly accepting it, were likely to prevent him <lb/>
from applying so large a sum to his own, or to your benefit; <lb/>
he would either let it lie idle in his coffers, under the belief <lb/>
that so ambiguous a transfer gave him no right to it, or he <lb/>
would more probably spend it on some charitable scheme. <lb/>
I was acquainted with his enthusiasm, in the cause of what he <lb/>
called the good of mankind, and that his notions of the goods <lb/>
and evils of life differed much from those of his sister.</p>
<p>"This act, however, was not to be recalled, and it was <lb/>
useless to make my brother repent of his precipitation. I <lb/>
I hoped that his intention would not be defeated, and watched <lb/>
the conduct of your brother very carefully, to discover the <lb/>
effect of his new acquisition. The effect was such as I <lb/>
expected. Your brother's mode of life underwent no <lb/>
change, and the money, as there were easy means of <reg orig="dis-|covering">discovering</reg>, <lb/>
lay in one of the banks untouched.</p>
<p>"My curiosity was awakened anew at your brother's death, <lb/>
and Sedley had the satisfaction of perceiving that your <reg orig="con-|dition">condition</reg> <lb/>
was visibly improved. You no longer hired out your <lb/>
labor; you lived in retirement indeed, but with some degree <lb/>
of neatness; and your time was spent in improving and <lb/>
adorning your mind, and in those offices of kindness and <lb/>
charity which, however arduous in themselves, are made <lb/>
light by the consciousness of dignity attending them.</p>
<pb n="105" entity="eaf033v5_0374" pid="uva-lib:350640"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">10</fw></pb>
<p>"I admire and love you, and that day which would make <lb/>
you my sister, I should count the happiest of my life. You <lb/>
have treated me with much distance and reserve; but I <lb/>
flattered myself that my overtures to intimacy had been <lb/>
rejected not on my own account, but on that of my brother. <lb/>
Since you have been my companion, I have noticed the <lb/>
proofs of your poverty with great uneasiness. I know that <lb/>
your money, all but a few hundred dollars, still lies in one of <lb/>
the banks. Will you pardon me for having been attentive <lb/>
to your conduct? For my brother's sake, and for your own, <lb/>
I have watched all your movements, and could tell you the <lb/>
times and portions in which these hundreds have been drawn <lb/>
out; and have formed very plausible guesses as to the mode <lb/>
in which you have disposed of them.</p>
<p>"How to reconcile your seeming poverty with the <reg orig="posses-|sion">possession</reg> <lb/>
of some thousands; how to account for your <reg orig="acquies-|cence">acquiescence</reg> <lb/>
in my wishes to attend me hither, and for forbearing <lb/>
to use any more of this money for the supply of your own <lb/>
wants, has puzzled me a great deal. I perceive that you <lb/>
have dropped all intercourse with your former friend, and <lb/>
given up yourself a prey to melancholy. These things have <lb/>
excited, you will imagine, a great deal of reflection; but I <lb/>
have patiently waited till you yourself have thought proper <lb/>
to put aside the curtain that is drawn between us. This you <lb/>
have at length done, and I, in my turn, have disclosed what <lb/>
I am afraid my brother will never forgive me for doing."</p>
<p>I could not but be deeply affected by this representation. <lb/>
The generosity of Sedley and his sister; their perseverance <lb/>
in laboring for my good, when no personal advantage, not <lb/>
even the homage of a grateful spirit, could flow to themselves, <lb/>
made me feel the stings of somewhat like ingratitude. The <lb/>
merits and claims of Sedley came now to assume a new <lb/>
aspect. I had hitherto suffered different objects to engross <lb/>
my attention. I did not applaud or condemn myself for my <lb/>
conduct towards him, merely because I did not think of him. <lb/>
I was occupied by gloomy reveries, in which no images <reg orig="ap-|peared">appeared</reg> <lb/>
but those of Stanley and my brother.</p>
<p>Now the subjects of my thoughts were changed; time had <lb/>
insensibly, and in some degree, worn out those deep traces <lb/>
which I brought away with me from Abingdon. Pity and <lb/>
<pb n="106" entity="eaf033v5_0375" pid="uva-lib:350641"/>
complacency, and reverence for Sedley; gratitude to his <lb/>
sister, from whom I had received so many favors, and who <lb/>
would deem herself amply repaid by my consent to make <lb/>
her brother happy, hourly gained ground in my heart.</p>
<p>These tendencies did not escape my friend, who <reg orig="endea-|vored">endeavored</reg> <lb/>
to strengthen and promote them. She insisted on the <lb/>
merits of her brother, arising from the integrity of his life, the <lb/>
elevation of his sentiments, and especially the constancy of <lb/>
his affection to me. She praised my self denial with regard <lb/>
to Stanley, and hinted that my duty to him was but half <lb/>
performed. It became me to shew that my happiness was <lb/>
consistent with self denial.</p>
<p>"Marriage with Miss Howard will give him but little <reg orig="plea-|sure">pleasure</reg>," <lb/>
she said, "while he is a stranger to your fate, or while <lb/>
he knows that you are unhappy. For his sake it becomes <lb/>
you to shake off all useless repinings. To waste your days <lb/>
in this dejection, in longings after what is unattainable, and <lb/>
what you have voluntarily given up, is contemptible, and, <lb/>
indeed, criminal. You have profited but little by the lessons <lb/>
of that religion you profess, if you see not the impiety of <lb/>
despair, and the necessity of changing your conduct. You <lb/>
have indeed fallen into a very gross error with regard to your <lb/>
friend. In some respects, you have treated him in an <reg orig="inhu-|man">inhuman</reg> <lb/>
manner."</p>
<p>"Good Heaven, Mrs. Valentine, in what respect have I <lb/>
been inhuman?"</p>
<p>"Have you not detailed to me the contents of the letter <lb/>
which you left behind you at Abingdon? In that letter have <lb/>
you not assured him that your heart was broken? that <lb/>
you expected and wished for death?&mdash;wishes that sprung <lb/>
from the necessity there was of renouncing his love. Have <lb/>
you not given him reason to suppose that you are enduring <lb/>
all the evils of penury and neglect? That you are <reg orig="languish-|ing">languishing</reg> <lb/>
in some obscure corner, unknown, neglected, forgotten, <lb/>
and despised by all mankind? Have you not done this?"</p>
<p>"Alas! it is too true."</p>
<p>"Not to mention that this picture was by no means <reg orig="justi-|fied">justified</reg> <lb/>
by the circumstances in which you left Abingdon, and <lb/>
in which you could not but expect to pass the winter, amidst <lb/>
all the comforts which my character, my station in society, <lb/>
my friends, my fortune, and my friendship, must bestow; not <lb/>
<pb n="107" entity="eaf033v5_0376" pid="uva-lib:350642"/>
to mention these things, which rendered your statement to <lb/>
him untrue, what must have been the influence of this picture <lb/>
upon the feelings of that generous youth? Can you not <reg orig="ima-|gine">imagine</reg> <lb/>
his affliction?"</p>
<p>"O yes, indeed I can. I was wrong; I now see my error. <lb/>
I believed that I should not have survived to this hour; I <lb/>
wanted to cut off every hope, every possibility of his union <lb/>
with me."</p>
<p>"And do you think that by that letter, this end was <reg orig="an-|swered">answered</reg>? <lb/>
Do you not perceive that Stanley's sympathy for <lb/>
you must have been infinitely increased by that distressful <lb/>
picture? that his resolution to find you out in your retreat, <lb/>
and compel you to be happy, would receive tenfold energy? <lb/>
You imagine yourself to have resigned him to Miss Howard, <lb/>
but your letter and your flight could only bind him by <lb/>
stronger ties to yourself. Should this lady be inclined to <lb/>
favor Stanley, of what materials must her heart be <reg orig="com-|posed">composed</reg>, <lb/>
if she do not refuse, or at least, hesitate to interfere <lb/>
with your claims? If she do not refuse, how must her <lb/>
happiness be embittered by reflections on your forlorn state? <lb/>
for no doubt the young man's sincerity will make her <reg orig="mis-|tress">mistress</reg> <lb/>
of your story."</p>
<p>"Do not dwell upon this theme," said I, "I am grieved for <lb/>
my folly. I have been very wrong; tell me rather, my beloved <lb/>
monitor, what I ought to have done&mdash;what I may still do."</p>
<p>"It would be useless to dwell on what is past, and cannot <lb/>
be undone; the future is fully in your power. Without doubt, <lb/>
you ought to hasten to repair the errors you have committed."</p>
<p>"By what means?"</p>
<p>"They are obvious. You must dismiss these useless, <lb/>
these pernicious regrets, which, in every view, religious or <lb/>
moral, are criminal; you must give admission to cheerful <lb/>
thoughts, fix your attention on the objects of useful <reg orig="know-|ledge">knowledge</reg>, <lb/>
study the happiness of those around you, be affable <lb/>
and social, and entitle yourself to the friendship and respect <lb/>
of the many amiable persons who live near us; above all, <lb/>
make haste to inform Stanley of your present condition, <reg orig="dis-|close">disclose</reg> <lb/>
to him your new prospects of being useful and happy, <lb/>
and teach him to be wise by your example. But let your <lb/>
kindness be most shewn where your power is greatest, and <lb/>
where you are most strongly bound by the ties of gratitude. <lb/>
<pb n="108" entity="eaf033v5_0377" pid="uva-lib:350643"/>
Think of my brother as he merits to be thought of&mdash;hasten <lb/>
to reward him for those years of anguish which your <reg orig="per-|verseness">perverseness</reg> <lb/>
has given him, and which have consumed the best <lb/>
part of his life."</p>
<p>"But how shall I gain an interview with Stanley? I <lb/>
know not where he is. You say that my draft has never <lb/>
been presented; it must be so, since the money is still there, <lb/>
in my own name. Some accident perhaps has befallen him; <lb/>
he may not be alive to receive the fruits of my repentance."</p>
<p>"Set your heart at rest," replied my friend, with a <reg orig="signi-|ficant">significant</reg> <lb/>
smile; "he is well."</p>
<p>"Indeed! You speak as if you had the means of <reg orig="know-|ing">knowing</reg>. <lb/>
Surely, Madam, you know nothing of him."</p>
<p>"I know enough of him. He is now in New York, in <lb/>
the same house with Miss Howard."</p>
<p>"In the same house? And&mdash;perhaps&mdash;married?"</p>
<p>"Fie upon you, Mary. Is this the courage you have just <lb/>
avowed, to turn pale, to falter at the mere possibility of <lb/>
what you have so earnestly endeavored to accomplish?"</p>
<p>"Forgive me&mdash;it was a momentary folly. He is then&mdash; <lb/>
married?"</p>
<p>"No. They live under the same roof; but it is nothing <lb/>
but a vague surmise that they will ever be married."</p>
<p>"Dear lady, by what means&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Through my brother's letters, which, if you please to <lb/>
read them, will give you all the information that I possess. <lb/>
Why that sudden gravity? They will not taint your fingers, <lb/>
or blast your sight; they are worthy of my brother, and <lb/>
will depict truly that character which you could not fail to <lb/>
love, if you were but thoroughly acquainted with it."</p>
<p>This rebuke suppressed the objection which I was going <lb/>
to raise against perusing these letters. They were put into <lb/>
my hands; they contained no information respecting <reg orig="Stan-|ley">Stanley</reg>, <lb/>
but that he resided at New York.</p>
<p>They contained, chiefly, incidents and reflections relative <lb/>
to Sedley and to me; in this respect they were copious. I <lb/>
read them often, and found myself daily confirmed in the <lb/>
resolutions which I began to form. I need not dwell upon <lb/>
the struggles which I occasionally experienced, and those <lb/>
fits of profound melancholy into which I was still sometimes <lb/>
plunged; I shall only say, that listening only to the dictates <lb/>
<pb n="109" entity="eaf033v5_0378" pid="uva-lib:350644"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">10*</fw></pb>
of justice and gratitude, and to the pathetic remonstrances <lb/>
of my friend, I finally prevailed upon myself to consent to <lb/>
her brother's wishes.</p>
<p>I should have written to Stanley, informing him of my <lb/>
destiny; but I proposed to return to Philadelphia with Mrs. <lb/>
Valentine, and hoped to meet him there, or at New York.</p>
<p>I was not unaware of the effects of an interview with <lb/>
him. My soul was tremulous with doubt, and torn by <reg orig="con-|flicting">conflicting</reg> <lb/>
emotions. I was ready, in dreary moments, to revoke <lb/>
my promise to Sedley, to trust once more to some kind <lb/>
chance that might make Stanley mine, or to consecrate my <lb/>
life to mournful recollections of my lost happiness. These <lb/>
were transient moments, and the bitter tears which attended <lb/>
them were soon dried up. I found complacency in the <reg orig="re-|solution">resolution</reg> <lb/>
to devote my life to Sedley's happiness, and to the <lb/>
society of his beloved sister.</p>
<p>Having arrived at New York, I was told of Stanley's <lb/>
absence, and learned that he was then somewhere <reg orig="south-|ward">southward</reg>. <lb/>
I was informed by Mrs. Etheridge, with whom <lb/>
Sedley made me acquainted, of your general character. I <lb/>
wanted to see you; to know you; to repose my thoughts <lb/>
in your bosom; to be Stanley's advocate with you; but I <lb/>
could not procure sufficient courage to request an <reg orig="introduc-|tion">introduction</reg> <lb/>
to you. A thousand scruples deterred me. I thought <lb/>
that to justify confidence and candor on such delicate topics, <lb/>
much time and many interviews would be necessary; but I <lb/>
could not remain in New York beyond a day.</p>
<p>I went to Mrs. Etheridge strangely perplexed. Perhaps <lb/>
I should have ventured to beseech that lady's company to <lb/>
your house; but the meeting that took place on that <reg orig="occa-|sion">occasion</reg>, <lb/>
confused me beyond the possibility of regaining <reg orig="com-|posure">composure</reg>. <lb/>
The superscription of your letter added to my <lb/>
surprise, and made me more willing to decline a meeting, <lb/>
since this letter would guide me to the very spot where <lb/>
Stanley was to be found.</p>
<p>I once more entered my native city. Sedley was <reg orig="pre-|pared">prepared</reg> <lb/>
to meet and welcome me. He was apprised of my <lb/>
intention as to Stanley, and did not disapprove&mdash;he even <lb/>
wrote the billet by which I invited your friend to come to <lb/>
my lodgings.</p>
<pb n="110" entity="eaf033v5_0379" pid="uva-lib:350645"/>
<p>My purpose was to unfold the particulars contained in this <lb/>
letter to Stanley, and to introduce my two friends to each <lb/>
other. In answer to my billet I received a voluminous <lb/>
packet, containing certain letters and narratives relative to <lb/>
him and to you.</p>
<p>How shall I describe my feelings on perusing them! <lb/>
They supply the place of a thousand conversations; they <lb/>
leave nothing to be said; they take away every remnant of <lb/>
hesitation; they inspire me with new virtue and new joy. <lb/>
I am not grieved that Stanley and his Clara are subjected <lb/>
to trials of their magnanimity, since I foresee the propitious <lb/>
issue of the trial. I am not grieved that the happiness of <lb/>
Mary has been an object of such value in your eyes, as to <lb/>
merit the sacrifice of your own. I exult that my feelings <lb/>
are akin to your's, and that it is in my power to vie with you <lb/>
in generosity.</p>
<p>But Stanley's last letter gives me pain; the more, because <lb/>
in the tenor of your's which preceded it, there is an apparent <lb/>
harshness, not, perhaps, to be mistaken by an unimpassioned <lb/>
reader, but liable to produce fallacious terrors in a heart <lb/>
deeply enamoured. I see the extent of this error in him; <lb/>
but am consoled by hoping that my reasoning, when we <lb/>
meet, or at least, that time will dispel this unfriendly cloud. <lb/>
I am impatient for his coming.</p>

</opener>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">My</hi> friend, we have met, but such a meeting!</p>
<p>The letters had told me of his sickness, but I expected <lb/>
not to behold a figure so wan, so feeble, so decayed. I <reg orig="ex-|pected">expected</reg> <lb/>
much anxiety&mdash;much conflict in his features, <reg orig="be-|tween">between</reg> <lb/>
apprehension and hope; but not an aspect so wild, so <lb/>
rueful, so melancholy. His deportment and his words were <lb/>
equally adverse to my expectations.</p>
<p>After our first tears of congratulation were exhausted, he <lb/>
exclaimed, in a tone of unusual vehemence&mdash;"Why, my <lb/>
<pb n="111" entity="eaf033v5_0380" pid="uva-lib:350646"/>
friend, have you thus long abandoned me? You have been <lb/>
unjust to yourself and to me; and I know not how to <reg orig="par-|don">pardon</reg> <lb/>
you, except on one condition."</p>
<p>"What is that?"</p>
<p>"That we now meet to be united by the strongest ties, <lb/>
and never to part more. On that condition I forgive you."</p>
<p>I was prepared for this question; but the tones and looks <lb/>
with which it was accompanied, and especially its <reg orig="abrupt-|ness">abruptness</reg>, <lb/>
disconcerted me&mdash;I was silent.</p>
<p>"I came to this interview," resumed he, "with one <reg orig="de-|termination">determination</reg>. <lb/>
I will not tremble, or repine, or upbraid, <reg orig="be-|cause">because</reg> <lb/>
my confidence in the success of my efforts is perfect, <lb/>
and not to be shaken. I came to offer you the vows of a <lb/>
husband. They are now offered, and received. You have <lb/>
no power to decline them. Let me then salute you as&mdash;my <lb/>
wife."</p>
<p>I shrunk back, and spread out my hand to repulse him. <lb/>
I was still unable to speak.</p>
<p>"I told you the purpose of my coming," said he, in a <lb/>
solemn tone; "this purpose is the dearest to my heart. <lb/>
Of every other good I am bereaved; but to the attainment <lb/>
of this there can be no obstacle but caprice, or inhumanity, <lb/>
or folly; such as I never can impute to you. If you love <lb/>
me, if you have regard to my welfare, if you wish me to <lb/>
love, grant me that good which is all that remains to endear <lb/>
existence. If you refuse this gift, I shall instantly vanish <lb/>
from society. I shall undertake a journey, in which my <lb/>
life will be exposed to numberless perils. If I pass them <lb/>
in safety, I shall be dead to all the offices and pleasures of <lb/>
civilized existence. I shall hasten to embrute all my <reg orig="facul-|ties">faculties</reg>. <lb/>
I shall make myself akin to savages and tygers, and <lb/>
forget that I once was a man. This is no incoherent <reg orig="inti-|mation">intimation</reg>; <lb/>
it is the fixed purpose of my soul, to be changed <lb/>
only by your consenting to be mine. Ponder well on the <lb/>
consequences of a refusal&mdash;it decides my everlasting <reg orig="des-|tiny">destiny</reg>."</p>
<p>"Have you not read my letter? Have I not read your's <lb/>
and Clara's? How then can you expect my concurrence? <lb/>
Have you not anticipated my refusal?"</p>
<p>"I anticipated misery. Having found injustice and a <lb/>
callous heart in another, where I least expected to find them, <lb/>
<pb n="112" entity="eaf033v5_0381" pid="uva-lib:350647"/>
I was prone, in the bitterness of disappointment, to ascribe <lb/>
them to every human creature; but that was rash and absurd <lb/>
&mdash;Mary cannot be unjust."</p>
<p>"To whom do you impute a hard heart?"</p>
<p>"Not to you. You merit not the imputation; you will <lb/>
prove yourself compassionate and good; you will not scorn <lb/>
me, cast me off, drive me into hopeless exile, and <reg orig="inextri-|cable">inextricable</reg> <lb/>
perils. You are too good, and have been too long <lb/>
my friend; the partaker of my cares; the solace of my <lb/>
being; the rewarder of my tenderness. You will not reject <lb/>
me&mdash;banish me&mdash;kill me."</p>
<p>"You know not what you say; your thoughts are <reg orig="con-|fused">confused</reg>. <lb/>
You love, and are beloved by another&mdash;by one who <lb/>
merits your eternal devotion and gratitude. They are due <lb/>
to her, and never will I rob her of them."</p>
<p>"What mean you? Did not you say you had read the <lb/>
packets? and do not these inform you that I have no place <lb/>
in the affections of any human being but yourself? <reg orig="Con-|vince">Convince</reg> <lb/>
me that I have, indeed, a place in yours&mdash;that I am <lb/>
not utterly deserted. Consent to be mine own&mdash;my <reg orig="belov-|ed">beloved</reg> <lb/>
wife, and thus make me as happy as my fate will permit."</p>
<p>"Alas, my friend! you are not in your right mind. <reg orig="Dis-|appointment">Disappointment</reg> <lb/>
has injured your reason, or you could never <lb/>
solicit me thus&mdash;you could never charge Clara Howard with <lb/>
a hard heart."</p>
<p>"Talk not of Clara Howard&mdash;talk only of yourself and <lb/>
of me. Rid me of suspense and anxiety, by consenting <lb/>
to my wishes&mdash;make me happy. Take away, at least, the <lb/>
largest portion of my misery, by your consent. Will you <lb/>
not be mine?"</p>
<p>"Never. Former objections time has rendered more <lb/>
strong; but your letters would have fixed my resolutions, <lb/>
had they wavered. These shew how far the happiness of <lb/>
of Miss Howard and your own depend upon my <reg orig="persever-|ance">perseverance</reg>; <lb/>
and persevere I must."</p>
<p>"What mean you? Miss Howard's happiness, say you, <lb/>
depends upon your noncompliance with her wishes; on your <lb/>
rejecting the prayers she has made with the utmost degree <lb/>
of earnestness?"</p>
<p>"They are generous prayers, which suppose me weaker, <lb/>
and more infatuated than I am. They are prayers which <lb/>
<pb n="113" entity="eaf033v5_0382" pid="uva-lib:350648"/>
counteract their own purpose, since they exhibit an example <lb/>
of disinterestedness and self-oblivion, which I cannot fail to <lb/>
admire and to imitate. Our cases are indeed not parallel. <lb/>
Her love for you is answered and returned by equal love. <lb/>
To me your heart is indifferent, and I have resolved to <reg orig="con-|quer">conquer</reg> <lb/>
my perverse affections, or perish."</p>
<p>"You have read her letters&mdash;her last letter, and you talk <lb/>
of her love! Once, I grant, it might have been&mdash;it was so; <lb/>
but that time of affability, of softness, of yielding, is gone; <lb/>
she is now rugged, austere, unfeeling. Her preposterous <lb/>
abstractions and refinements have gained force through the <lb/>
coldness of her heart. There is no self-sacrifice, for she <lb/>
loves me not; there is no regard for my welfare or felicity, <lb/>
for she loves me not."</p>
<p>"O, Philip, can you be so perverse, so unjust? You <lb/>
merit not the love of so pure a spirit; you merit not the <lb/>
happiness which such a one is qualified to give you. But <lb/>
your disappointment has disturbed your reason. I can pity <lb/>
and forgive you, and will intercede with her for your <reg orig="forgive-|ness">forgiveness</reg>. <lb/>
I see her merits and her superior claims too clearly, <lb/>
ever to consent to your separation. You are discomposed," <lb/>
I continued, "surely you have been very sick. You seem <lb/>
to have just risen from the grave, you are so pale, so wan, <lb/>
so feeble. Your state of health has made you unfit to judge <lb/>
truly of the motives of your friend, and to adopt her <reg orig="mag-|nanimity">magnanimity</reg>. <lb/>
If you will have patience, I can convince you <lb/>
that it is my duty to reject your offers, and that Clara <reg orig="How-|ard">Howard</reg> <lb/>
may still, if you please, be yours."</p>
<p>"Then," replied he, "you do reject them?"</p>
<p>"Do not look so wildly. I am sure you are not well. <lb/>
You seem ready to sink upon the floor; you are cold&mdash; <lb/>
very cold. Let us defer this conversation a little while. I <lb/>
have much to say on the subject of my history, since we <lb/>
parted. That being known to you, you will see reason to <lb/>
judge differently of my motives for rejecting your offers; <lb/>
instead of making that rejection more difficult by <reg orig="impor-|tunity">importunity</reg> <lb/>
and vehemence, you will see the justice of concurring <lb/>
with me, and of strengthening my resolution."</p>
<p>"Impossible," said he, "that any thing has happened to <lb/>
change my views. Are not your affections, merits, and <reg orig="in-|tegrity">integrity</reg>, <lb/>
the same as formerly? Answer me sincerely."</p>
<pb n="114" entity="eaf033v5_0383" pid="uva-lib:350649"/>
<p>"I will&mdash;I have no reason for concealment. Time has <lb/>
not lessened my merits, it is true; but&mdash;"</p>
<p>"That assurance is enough for me. I will eagerly listen <lb/>
to your story, but not until my fate is decided. Have pity <lb/>
on that sinking frame, and that wounded heart which you <lb/>
behold; there is but one cure, and that is deposited in your <lb/>
hands. To every other my joy or sorrow, my life or death <lb/>
is indifferent. Will you take me to your bosom? Shall <lb/>
my image be fostered, and my soul find peace there? or <lb/>
shall I cast myself upon a sea of storms and perils, and <reg orig="van-|ish">vanish</reg> <lb/>
from this scene for ever?"</p>
<p>"How you grieve me! I beseech you be not so <reg orig="impetu-|ous">impetuous</reg>. <lb/>
Listen to my story first, and then say in what <reg orig="man-|ner">manner</reg> <lb/>
I ought to act."</p>
<p>"There is no room for delay. Say you will be mine, <lb/>
and then I shall enjoy repose; I shall be able to listen. Till <lb/>
then I am stretched upon the rack. Answer me; will you <lb/>
be mine?"</p>
<p>"O, no!" I replied; "while I have a heart not wholly <lb/>
sordid and selfish, I cannot consent; my conscience will not <lb/>
let me."</p>
<p>"Find consolation," he answered, "in the approbations <lb/>
of that conscience, for a sentence that has ratified the doom <lb/>
of one who deserved differently from you. I perceive you <lb/>
are inflexible, and will therefore leave you."</p>
<p>"But whither are you going? Will you not return to <lb/>
Clara?</p>
<p>"To Clara! No. Far different is the path that I am <lb/>
to tread. I shall never see her more."</p>
<p>He now moved towards the door, as if going.</p>
<p>"Philip, what can you mean? Stay; do not go till you <lb/>
have heard me further. I entreat you, as you value my <lb/>
peace, and my life, hear me further."</p>
<p>"Will you then consent?" said he, returning with a more <lb/>
cheerful brow. "How good you are! The same dear <lb/>
girl; the same angelic benignity as formerly. Confirm my <lb/>
happiness by new assurances; confirm it by permitting this <lb/>
embrace."</p>
<p>I was compelled to avert my face; to repulse him from <lb/>
my arms.</p>
<p>"To what unlooked-for trials have you subjected me! but <lb/>
<pb n="115" entity="eaf033v5_0384" pid="uva-lib:350650"/>
I must not retract my resolutions. No, Philip, the bar <reg orig="be-|tween">between</reg> <lb/>
us is insuperable. I must never be yours."</p>
<p>"Never!&mdash;never!&mdash;be mine!&mdash;Well&mdash;May the arms of <lb/>
a protecting Providence encircle thee! may some other rise <lb/>
to claim and possess thy love! may ye never, neither thou <lb/>
nor Clara, know remorse for your treatment of me!"</p>
<p>Saying this, he snatched his hat from the table, and ran <lb/>
out of the house. I called, but he was gone beyond my <lb/>
hearing.</p>
<p>I was justly alarmed by this frantic demeanor. I knew <lb/>
not how to account for it, but by imagining that some <reg orig="re-|mains">remains</reg> <lb/>
of delirium still afflicted his understanding. I related <lb/>
this conversation to Sedley. I entreated him to pursue <lb/>
Philip to his lodgings, to prevail upon him to return hither; <lb/>
or to calm his mind, by relating what his abrupt departure <lb/>
had prevented me from saying.</p>
<p>Sedley cheerfully complied with my request; but Stanley <lb/>
was not to be found at his lodging. He waited his return <lb/>
till ten, eleven, and twelve o'clock, but in vain.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I found some relief in imagining they had <lb/>
met; that Sedley's address and benevolence had succeeded <lb/>
in restoring our friend to better thoughts. My <reg orig="disappoint-|ment">disappointment</reg> <lb/>
and alarm at his return, on hearing that Stanley had <lb/>
not been met with, were inexpressible. That night passed <lb/>
away without repose. Early the next morning, I again <lb/>
entreated Sedley to go in search of the fugitive. He went, <lb/>
but presently returned to inform me that Stanley had set out <lb/>
in the stage for Baltimore, at day-dawn.</p>
<p>I cannot comprehend his intimations of a journey to the <lb/>
wilderness; of embruting his faculties; of exposing his <reg orig="hu-|manity">humanity</reg>, <lb/>
his life, to hazard. Could he have interpreted your <lb/>
letters into avowals of hatred or scorn, or even of <reg orig="indiffer-|ence">indifference</reg>? <lb/>
One, indeed, who knew you less perfectly, might <lb/>
impute to you a rigor in judging; a sternness not suitable to <lb/>
the merits of this youth. Your letters are void of that <reg orig="ex-|tenuating">extenuating</reg> <lb/>
spirit, that reluctance to inflict sufferings, which, <lb/>
perhaps, the wisest inflexibility will not be slow to feel, or <lb/>
unwilling to express. But Philip had sufficient knowledge <lb/>
to save him from a wrong construction.</p>
<p>Yet that, alas! is not true. He ought to have had that <lb/>
knowledge; but it was wanting.</p>
<pb n="116" entity="eaf033v5_0385" pid="uva-lib:350651"/>
<p>Possibly he has not told you his designs. He cannot <lb/>
inform you of the truth with respect to me. My present <lb/>
situation should be known to you, to enable you to act with <lb/>
propriety. I shall not prescribe to you; I am not mistress <lb/>
of your thoughts and motives; may Heaven direct you <lb/>
right.</p>
<p>A friend will go to Baltimore on Tuesday, time enough <lb/>
for you to receive this, and to write to Philip. If sent to me, <lb/>
I will entrust it to my friend. I have not time to add a <lb/>
word more.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Stanley,</hi> how shall I address you? In terms of <reg orig="indigna-|tion">indignation</reg> <lb/>
or of kindness? Shall I entreat you to return, or <reg orig="ex-|hort">exhort</reg> <lb/>

urgent obligations of gratitude? whom the charms of <reg orig="na-|ture">nature</reg>, <lb/>
the attractions of science, the claims of helpless and <lb/>
fond sisters, who trust for shelter, for bread, for safety from <lb/>
contempt, and servitude, and vice, to his protection, his <lb/>
counsel, his presence, cannot detain from forests and wilds, <lb/>
where inevitable death awaits him?</p>
<p>Shall I bestow one drop of tender remembrance on him <lb/>
who upbraids and contemns me for sacrificing every selfish <lb/>
regard to his dignity; for stifling in my bosom that ignoble <lb/>
passion which makes us trample on the claims of others, <lb/>
which seeks its own gratification at the price of humanity <lb/>
and justice, which can smile in the midst of repinings and <lb/>
despair, of creatures no less worthy, no less susceptible of <lb/>

<p>You say that I love you not. Till this moment your <reg orig="as-|sertion">assertion</reg> <lb/>
was untrue. My heart was not free, till these proofs <lb/>
of your infatuation and your folly were set before me. Till <lb/>
now, I was willing to account you not unworthy. I hoped <lb/>
that time and my efforts would reclaim you to some sense of <lb/>
equity and reason.</p>
<p>But now&mdash;must I then deem you utterly lost? Have you <lb/>
committed this last and irretrievable act? O, no! it was <lb/>
surely but a momentary madness; the fit will be past before <lb/>
this letter reaches you; you will have opened your eyes to <lb/>
the cowardice, the ignominy, the guilt of this flight; you <lb/>
will hasten to close those wounds which have rent my heart; <lb/>
you will return to me with the speed of the wind, and make <lb/>
me, by the rectitude of your future conduct, forget that you <lb/>
have ever erred.</p>
<p>Has it come to this! now, that the impediment has <reg orig="van-|ished">vanished</reg>, <lb/>
that my feelings may be indulged at the cost of no <lb/>
one's peace; now that the duty which once so sternly <reg orig="for-|bade">forbade</reg> <lb/>
me to be yours, not only permits, but enjoins me to <lb/>
link together our fates; that the sweet voice of an approving <lb/>
conscience is ready to sanction and applaud every impulse <lb/>
of my heart, and make the offices of tenderness not only free <lb/>
from guilt, but coincident with every duty; that now&mdash;</p>
<p>Philip, let me hope that thou hast hesitated, doubted, <lb/>
lingered in thy fatal career&mdash;let me foster this hope that <lb/>
I may retain life. My fortitude, alas! is unequal to this <lb/>
test. No disaster should bereave me of serenity and courage; <lb/>
but to this, while I despise myself for yielding, I must yield.</p>
<p>If this letter do not reach thee&mdash;if it fill not thy heart <lb/>
with remorse, thy eyes with tenderness&mdash;if it cure thee <lb/>
not of thy phrenzy, and bring thee not back&mdash;</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">What</hi> has become of that fortitude, my friend, which I <lb/>
was once accustomed to admire in you? You used to be <lb/>
circumspect, sedate, cautious; not precipitate in judging or <lb/>
resolving. What has become of all these virtues?</p>
<p>Why would you not give your poor friend a patient <reg orig="hear-|ing">hearing</reg>? <lb/>
Why not hesitate a moment, before you plunged all <lb/>
whom you love into sorrow and distress? Was it impossible <lb/>
for six months of reflection to restore the strength of my <lb/>
mind, to introduce wiser resolutions and more cheerful <lb/>
thoughts, than those with which I parted from you?</p>
<p>I was then sick. My lonely situation, the racking fears <lb/>
your long silence had produced, a dreary and lowering sky, <lb/>
and the tidings your letter conveyed of my return again to <lb/>
that indigence so much detested by my pride, were surely <lb/>
enough to sink me deeply in despondency; to make me, at <lb/>
the same time, desire and expect my death.</p>
<p>I saw the bright destiny that was reserved for you. My <lb/>
life, I thought, stood in the way of your felicity. I knew your <lb/>
impetuous generosity, your bewitching eloquence. I knew the <lb/>
frailty of my own heart. Hence my firm resolve to shun an <lb/>
interview with you, to see you no more, at least till your <lb/>
destiny had been accomplished.</p>
<p>Happy was the hour in which I formed this resolution. <lb/>
By it I have not only secured that indirect happiness, arising <lb/>
from the contemplation of yours, but the ineffable bliss of <lb/>
requiting that love, of which my heart was so long insensible.</p>
<p>Yes, my friend, the place that you once possessed in my <lb/>
affections, is now occupied by another&mdash;by him of whose <lb/>
claims I know you have always been the secret advocate&mdash; <lb/>
by that good, wise, and generous man, whom I always <lb/>
admitted to be second to yourself; but for whom my heart <lb/>
now acknowledges a preference.</p>
<p>Had you waited for an explanation of my sentiments, you <lb/>
would have saved me, your beloved Clara, yourself, and all <lb/>
your friends, the anxieties your present absence has <reg orig="pro-|duced">produced</reg>. <lb/>

That rashness may excite remorse, but it cannot be <lb/>
recalled; let it then be speedily forgotten, and let this letter <lb/>
put a stop to your flight.</p>
<p>Dear Philip! come back. All the addition of which <lb/>
my present happiness is capable, must come from you. <lb/>
The heart-felt approbation, the sweet ineffable complacency <lb/>
with which my present feelings are attended, want nothing <lb/>
to merit the name of perfect happiness, but to be witnessed <lb/>
and applauded by you.</p>
<p>Your Clara&mdash;that noblest of women, joins me in <reg orig="recal-|ling">recalling</reg> <lb/>
you, and is as eager to do justice to your passion, as I <lb/>
am to recompense the merits of Sedley; therefore, my <lb/>
friend, if you value my happiness or Clara's, come back. <lb/>
Will you not obey the well known voice, calling you to <lb/>
virtue and felicity, of</p>
<closer>
<salute>Your sister,</salute>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">I have</hi> received and have read your letter. To say <lb/>
thus much is enough. From what a depth of humiliation <lb/>
and horror have I emerged! How quickly was I posting to <lb/>
my ignominy and my ruin! Your letter overtook me at this <lb/>
place, where a benignant fate decreed that I should be <lb/>
detained by sickness.&mdash;Clara, thou hast judged truly. My <lb/>
eyes are open to my folly, and my infatuation. The mists <lb/>
that obscured my sight are gone; I am once more a <reg orig="reason-|able">reasonable</reg> <lb/>
creature.</p>
<p>How shall I atone for my past misconduct, or compensate <lb/>
thee, my heavenly monitor, for the disquiet which thou hast <lb/>
endured for my sake? By hasting to thy feet, and pouring <lb/>
out before thee the tears of my repentance. Thy <reg orig="forgive-|ness">forgiveness</reg> <lb/>
is all that I dare claim&mdash;thy tenderness I do not merit. <lb/>
Years of service and self-denial, are requisite to qualify me <lb/>
for receiving that best gift.</p>

<p>Your letter, with one from Mary, were left upon my <reg orig="pil-|low">pillow</reg> <lb/>
by a traveller passing through this town to Baltimore. I <lb/>
had swallowed laudanum, to secure me some sleep, on the <lb/>
night of my arrival hither. I was unable to proceed further, <lb/>
my mind and body being equally distempered. After a <lb/>
perturbed sleep, I awoke before the light, and lifting my head <lb/>
from the pillow, to acquaint myself with my situation, I <reg orig="per-|ceived">perceived</reg>, <lb/>
by the light of a candle on the hearth, a packet lying <lb/>
beside me. I snatched it with eagerness, and found <reg orig="enclos-|ed">enclosed</reg>, <lb/>
thy letter, and one from Mary.</p>
<p>For a time, I imagined myself still dreaming. The <reg orig="con-|tents">contents</reg> <lb/>
of each letter so far surpassed and deceived every <lb/>
expectation&mdash;every wish that I had formed; such pure and <lb/>
unmerited felicity was offered me, and by means so abrupt <lb/>
and inexplicable, that I might well hesitate to believe it real.</p>
<p>Next morning, on inquiry, I discovered that a midnight <lb/>
coach had arrived, in which a traveller, chancing to hear of <lb/>
my condition, and my name, entered my apartment, while I <lb/>
slept, and left this packet, which, as I saw, was intended to <lb/>
have been conveyed to Baltimore.</p>
<p>My fever, though violent, proved to be merely an <reg orig="inter-|mittent">intermittent</reg>. <lb/>
By noon this day, though feeble and languid, I <lb/>
was freed from disease; I am also free from anxiety. The <lb/>
purest delight thrills in my bosom, mixed now and then, and <lb/>
giving place to compunction, for the folly of my late <lb/>
schemes. In truth, I have been sick; since the perusal of <lb/>
thy letter by Mary, I have been half crazy, shivering and <lb/>
glowing by turns; bereft of appetite and restless&mdash;every <lb/>
object was tinged with melancholy liues.</p>
<p>But I shall not try to extenuate my fault. May thy smiles, <lb/>
my beloved Clara, and thy voice, musical and thrilling as it <lb/>
used to be, disperse every disquiet. No time shall be lost <lb/>
in returning to thee. My utmost haste will not enable me <lb/>
to offer thee, before Tuesday morning, the hand and heart <lb/>
of</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">You</hi> are coming, my friend. I shall chide you and thank <lb/>
you in the same breath, for your haste. I hope you will <lb/>
incur no injury by a journey at night. Knowing that you <lb/>
mean not to lay by, I am unable to go to bed. The air <lb/>
was blustering in the evening, and now, at midnight, it blows <lb/>
a storm. It is not very cold, but a heavy rain is falling. <lb/>
I sit by my chamber fire, occupied in little else than listening <lb/>
to it; and my heart droops, or gains courage, according to <lb/>
the pauses or increases of the wind and rain.</p>
<p>Would to Heaven thou hadst not this boisterous river to <lb/>
cross. It is said to be somewhat dangerous in a high wind. <lb/>
This is a land of evils; the transitions of the seasons are so <lb/>
quick, and into such extremes. How different from the <lb/>
pictures which our fancy drew in our native land!</p>
<p>This wind and rain! how will you endure them in your <lb/>
crazy vehicle, thumping over rocks, and sinking into <reg orig="hol-|lows?&mdash;I">hollows?&mdash;I</reg> <lb/>
wish you had not been in such haste; twenty <lb/>
hours sooner or later would be of no moment; and this <lb/>
river&mdash;to cross it at any time, is full of danger&mdash;what must <lb/>
it be at night, and in a storm? Your adventurous spirit <lb/>
will never linger on the opposite shore till day dawns, and <lb/>
the wind has died away.</p>
<p>But well know I the dangers and toils of a midnight <lb/>
journey, in a stage-coach, in America. The roads are knee <lb/>
deep in mire, winding through crags and pits, while the <lb/>
wheels groan and totter, and the curtains and roof admit the <lb/>
wet at a thousand seams.</p>
<p>It is three, and the day will soon come. How I long to <lb/>
see thee, my poor friend! Having once met, never, I <lb/>
promise thee, will we part more. This heart, with whose <lb/>
treasures thou art imperfectly acquainted, will pour all its <lb/>
sorrows and joys into thy honest bosom. My maturer age, <lb/>
and more cautious judgment, shall be counsellors and guides <lb/>
to thy inexperienced youth. While I love thee and cherish <lb/>
thee as a wife, I shall assume some of the prerogatives of <lb/>
<pb n="122" entity="eaf033v5_0391" pid="uva-lib:350657"/>
an elder sister, and put my circumspection and forethought <lb/>
in the balance against thy headlong confidence.</p>
<p>I revere thy genius and thy knowledge. With the <reg orig="im-|provements">improvements</reg> <lb/>
of time, very far wilt thou surpass the humble <lb/>
Clara; but in moral discernment, much art thou still <reg orig="defi-|cient">deficient</reg>; <lb/>
here I claim to be more than equal; but the difference <lb/>
shall not subsist long. Our modes of judging and our <lb/>
maxims shall be the same; and this resemblance shall be <lb/>
purchased at the cost of all my patience, my skill, and my <lb/>
love.</p>
<p>Alas! this rain is heavy. The gale whistles more loudly <lb/>
than ever. Would to Heaven thou wast safely seated near <lb/>
me, at this quiet fireside!</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Rejoice</hi> with me, my friend; Stanley is arrived; and <lb/>
has been little incommoded by his journey. He has brought <lb/>
with him your letter. Will you pardon me for omitting to <lb/>
answer it immediately, and as fully as it deserves? As soon <lb/>
as the tumults of my joy settle down into calm, unruffled <lb/>
felicity, I will comment upon every sentence; at present, I <lb/>
must devote myself to console this good lad for his <reg orig="suffer-|ings">sufferings</reg>, <lb/>
incurred, as he presumes to say, entirely on my <lb/>
account.</p>
<p>And so you have deferred the happiness of your Sedley <lb/>
for a whole month. I wonder he has any patience with <lb/>
you; but he that has endured, without much discontent, the <lb/>
delay of six or eight years (is it not so long?) ought to be <lb/>
ashamed of his impatience at a new delay of a few weeks.</p>
<p>Dear Mary, shall I tell you a secret? If you add one <lb/>
week of probation to the four already decreed, it is by no <lb/>
means impossible, that the same day may witness the <reg orig="happi-|ness">happiness</reg> <lb/>
of both of us. May that day, whenever it shall come, <lb/>
prove the beginning of joy to Mary, and to her, who, in <lb/>
every state, will be your affectionate</p>
