            <p>
            Well, the easy life is over
            now and we’re off for the 
            work ahead.  Its up at 
            3 A.M. and to bed after 
            dinner.  My machine seems
            to be good and climbs well,
            and now to master it as best
            I can.  I’ve been running
            around the country, but now
            that my mitrailleuse is ready
            I’m doing the real work.
            </p><p>
            This morning Chapman and I
            were the Luxeuil guard but
            if the people were aware
            of my utter unfamiliarity with
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0321" n="[p.2]"/>
            
            the job they wouldn’t have
            slept so soundly.  At 6.30
            the Captain ordered a “sortie
            en escadrille” over the lines.
            It was not good weather, the
            sky having various layers of
            clouds, and so it was hard
            to find one’s way.  It struck
            me as amusing in a way
            to be going out.  But few
            of us knew anything about 
            what should be done, and for
            the first time I tried to
            cock a mitrailleuse &mdash; but
            there we were &mdash; just as 
            if we knew something
            about it.  The first thing 
            I did was to lose the rest.
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0320" n="[p.3]"/>
            
            I had been climbing fast
            and was up in the clouds.
            The ground below was so
            hazy I did not make it
            out and I felt lost.  I
            was at 3000 meters then
            and floating in an unknown
            sea.  It was like a sea,
            the ice covered sea we 
            entered when we left St. Pierre - 
            Miquelon so long ago.  To the 
            south the Alps jutted up
            glistening like ice bergs.  Suddenly
            I saw a little black speck
            just above the clouds to
            my left and recognized it
            as one of the “Babies”.  Two,
            then three, popped up into
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0322" n="[p.4]"/>
            
            view.  I went over towards
            them.  The clouds had
            now begun to disperse
            and I could see the ground
            well below me and picked
            out a canal I located on
            my map that led to the
            Rhine.  Then we veered to
            the north east and I
            saw the trenches.  Suddenly
            a series of white puffs
            appeared to my right and
            below me and I realized
            we were being fired at.
            It was more amusing
            than alarming for they 
            were not coming close.
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0323" n="[p.5]"/>
            
            They did, however, seem to
            be near a machine I saw
            below me.  I was at 4,200 m.
            then, and higher than the 
            rest.  Finally the little puffs
            began to come nearer.  Some
            were green, others white and 
            the big ones black.  One
            went off at my altitude
            to the left &mdash; the next one
            nearer and I figured the
            third would be about right,
            but it wasn’t and after
            that they were away off.
            Yesterday they shot better.
            Rockwell, Chapman and Thaw
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0325" n="[p.6]"/>
            
            got it heavy.  Thaw’s propellor [sic]
            was nicked by an eclat
            and the landing bumper on
            his tail shot away.  We
            fooled around over Germany
            for about fifteen minutes.
            I became interested in looking
            at the Rhine and then had
            trouble finding any of our
            seven planes.  I hadn’t the
            remotest idea how far north
            or south I was.  We couldn’t
            find a single Boche plane
            tho [sic] we had sneaked in
            back of where they ought 
            to have been working over
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0324" n="[p.7]"/>
            
            the lines.  In a short
            while I will feel ashamed
            of having written about
            all these details &mdash; the shooting
            etc., for it will be an
            old story, and I’ll feel like
            a kid who has found interest
            in nothing, for having told 
            it.
            </p><p>
            To morrow the army
            moving picture outfit is
            to take us for the French
            propoganda [sic] in America.  We’ve
            staged a big show in
            connection with the bombardment
            machines here.  It will be 
            very funny to go thru [sic] with
                        
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0326" n="[p.8]"/>
            
            it.
            </p><p>
            I love your concern about
            Chapman.  Would he lack
            personality, because, before, he
            had sent no message?
            </p><p>
            Betty Baldwin is quite her
            self again as far as mind
            is concerned, so her mother
            writes me, but she is not
            allowed as yet to know of
            the torpedoing of the ship.  Funny,
            that.
