            <salute>Dear Marcelle:</salute>
        		</opener>
        		
            <p>
            I left Luxeuil the 31st of 
            May late in the afternoon and landed
            at Toul where I spent the night.  There
            was heavy mist the next morning
            and I did not get away until after
            eight.  I landed on the bad field
            here half an hour afterwards.  The
            escadrille was to go out at 12.30
            and so I made ready.  I had seen
            no map and looked at my aerial
            one for first time on climbing into
            the machine.  I counted on following
            the others.  Two of us left.  As
            the third was starting he glanced
            up and saw fourteen Boches overhead.
            Five mounted to the attack.  I passed
            right under them without seeing
            the enemy.  The Boches, as you have
            read in the papers, dropped a
            great number of bombs.  Fifty people 
            were killed and four times that
            number wounded.  Our five machines
            attacking got the worst of it.  The
            Germans used explosive bullets.
            Two ^of our planes were forced to come down
            and the others couldn’t do anything.
            My old ambulance section happens to
            be here and they picked up the
            wounded.  Dear, old Lovell stood right
            (over)

            in the place where the bombs were
            falling and directed his cars.  He
            is leaving in a few days to
            join the aviation corps.
            </p><p>
            Well I lost myself as I had
            presumed I would  and tho [sic] over
            the lines didn’t know where.  Looking
            down to my left I saw a machine.
            “Ha,” said I “One of ours” and felt happy.
            Then I saw the crosses.  A Boche!
            First one I’d seen from the air.  I
            did not know the slightest thing 
            about how to attack and I had
            never fired my mitrailleuse in the
            air.  It was with a queer feeling
            that I shut off my power, dove 
            towards the enemy plane and put
            my hand on the release of my
            machine gun.  When within fifty
            meters the Boche saw me and
            opened fire.  I sighted and gave
            him a round with no results.
            My speed carried me beyond.  I
            turned and found myself just 
            behind sighting into the flame of 
            his mitrailleuse.  I could hear the
            tut -tut -tut -tut of the gun and then
            his bullets ripped into my machine
            with the sound of small explosions.
            I sighted and fired again.  Still
            nothing doing.  I knew I would be
                        
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0347" n="[p.3]"/>
            
            killed in that position &mdash; the best
            possible for the German machine
            gun operator &mdash; and I threw myself
            onto my right side, mounted and 
            dove again.  I pressed my trigger
            and there was no response.  The
            Boche hit me again.  I turned and
            armed the machine gun.  Nothing
            doing.  I tried again.  Same result.
            Then back of me I heard the
            whirr [sic] and hammer of the mitrailleuse
            and looking up saw the Boche
            diving at me and shooting.  I
            put on full power, piced [sic] and 
            lost him.  I examined my machine
            gun and found a bullet had
            carried away the cartridge container.
            I tried to locate myself but it
            was in vain.  Then I headed S.W.
            and picked up a canal.  I could
            not find my bearing and hunted
            up other canals which I followed
            up and down.  For two and a
            half hours I did that and then
            gave it up as a bad job.  Just
            outside of a large town I saw a
            field that looked like an aviation
            center of some kind.  I came down
            low and circled around in order
            to bring out people.  I wanted to
            see if the soldiers were French or
            (over)
                        
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0348" n="[p.4]"/>
            
            German.  I saw the blue uniforms and
            made for my landing.  The field was
            covered with tall grass and while
            skimming the surface I hit a bump
            I could not see and shot up into
            the air, the machine turned nose
            down and crash.  Every thing broke
            as I went over on my back.  I
            was at St. Dizier.  I took my 
            instruments and in a car motored
            home.  I had been reported as
            missing and believed dead.  I counted
            nine holes in my machine some of 
            which were not a foot from my
            head.  I’ll have a new machine in
            a couple of days.  You see I am
            starting out like a dub [sic] so you
            must not expect much of me.
