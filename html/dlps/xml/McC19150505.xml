            I was overjoyed to receive 
            your first letter on my return
            from our advance point this morning.
            I took but four days from Paris,
            which is fairly quick.  It was
            very sweet of your to write me
            at such length and to let me
            know how you’re getting along.  Pretty 
            soon you’ll be running the
            Ambulance and then I will have
            to look out, won’t I?
            </p>
        		<p>
            Now that we have evacuated
            after the first big fight we witnessed
            work is not very hard and I
            really have more time on my hands
            than you have down in quiet, remote
            Paris.
        		</p>
        		<p>
            I suppose you have received
            (over)
                        
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0044" n="[2]"/>
            
            most of the post cards I sent you.
            I have dispatched about a dozen
            to you at different times.
        		</p>
        		<p>
            We have about a hundred and
            thirty German prisoners at our
            base now and have turned them
            into a “White Wings” gang to clean
            up the streets.  Only one or two
            of them have hats on for the
            others had them taken from them
            and those fellow wear rags and
            things around their heads which
            gives them a ridiculous looking
            air.  They are treated very well.
        		</p>
        		<p>
            I wish I could tell you about
            the lay of the land around our
            advance point for it would
            make things so much more
            interesting for you and you could
            get the picture so much clearer.
            Its very eerie working out there
                        
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0045" n="[3]"/>
            
            at night.  Especially when
            one has to go to the
            farthest place de secour.  No
            lights are allowed for fear of drawing
            the enemy’s fire.  Even cigarettes are
            forbidden.  It is almost impossible
            these dark nights to find one’s way.
            One creeps along, past sentinels who
            cry “Halte la!” and ask the pass
            word; past ^one long convoy after another,
            and through shadowy little groups
            of white walled houses.  It is only 
            when the dazzling illuminating shells
            mount into the sky over the long
            lines of trenches and light up the
            surrounding country that one can 
            proceed with any speed.  Often
            our batteries open fire in startling
            proximity to one and at first its
            quite a surprise.  When one is so
            (over)
                        
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0046" n="[4]"/>
            
            close the enemy’s shell do not
            have the warning whizzing sound,
            so unless one breaks near by its
            not a source of annoyance.  If it
            should get you, you would never
            hear anything.
        		</p>

            Last night a man was carried
            out to me that was dying.  It
            was very dark and I could not
            see him well.  I could hear his
            groans, tho [sic], all the way back.
            Finally he began to rat-a-tat-tat with
            his heels in spite of the fact
            that we had him lashed down
            and I thought he was passing.
            He lived at our base and wanted
            to be taken there to die.  I told
            him I would take him there but
            when I went to the hospital for
            my papers the doctor said he
            wouldn’t last for the trip and
            sent him around to another
                        
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0047" n="[5]"/>
            
            hospital.
        		</p>
        		<p>
            We carry some dreadful
            cases.  The other day even
            the French soldiers had to turn
            their heads away from the sight
            of one man.  I would hate to think
            of you being out here and having
            to go through it.  There are
            women Nurses at the hospital
            where we park our cars at
            our advance point and they
            are jealous of one another just
            as at Neuilly.  Seems strange,
            for when its so very serious
            it should run as smoothly
            as possible.  They do not know
            when a shell will kill them,
            however, and one has to admire
            their nerve for staying around.
                        
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0048" n="[6]"/>
            
            It is remarkable tho [sic] with
            what composure the little city goes
            along.  The shops are open, crowds 
            are in the street and above the
            heavy roar of cannon one can hear
            the drone of school children going
            thru [sic] their lessons.

            Our American friend Decker
            took us around yesterday to
            show us points of interest.  We
            walked along one of the most
            beautiful tree lined and covered
            avenues I’ve ever seen.  Then he
            took us by the rear way to his
            house.  The approach started where
            a marmite had wrecked a wall
            and ended in the most exquisite,
            walled in little garden one could
            imagine.  It was a perfect riot
            of color and the air was pungent
            with the delicious smell of
            flowers and blossoms.  Decker introduced
                        
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0049" n="[7]"/>
            
            us to a sweet old
            French lady who was
            sitting on a bench in
            front of a poppy bed.  War
            seemed very remote in there&mdash;
            and then I noticed the old
            lady was patching up holes
            where bullets had torn a uniform.
            The contrast of all that is
            true of the whole town.  The
            war is an every day affair
            and now reconciled to fitting in
            with the ways of peace.
            Of course its bad enough in the
            town but the chances of getting
            hit are few.  Its when we go
            out to the different place [sic] de secour
            that we wonder if we’re coming
                        
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0050" n="[8]"/>
            
            back, tho [sic] of course we don’t 
            spend much time wondering.
        		</p>
        		<p>
            Our squad is making good
            here every day and the French
            officials are well pleased.  I
            am very comfortable and happy,
            tho [sic] being so far away from 
            you and not having the
            pleasure of seeing and talking
            with you keeps me from being
            content.  I have my diary with
            me and that helps, for I can
            read in it and call to mind
            the many many happy times I
            had with you.
        		</p>

            Please give my sincerest regards
            to your mother and father and 
            keep most of my affection for
            yourself.  And do please write.
