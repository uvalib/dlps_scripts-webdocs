                </head>

                <p>Tenney comments on the atrocity of warfare, frustration about undependable postal
                    service, previous correspondence, and concern about the spread of disease. He
                    recounts recent events in which he has found inspiration: canned food delivered
                    to the sick by the Soldiers Aid Society; a religious service with a reading from
                    Proverbs 23: 32, a provocative sermon from Chaplain B. Wright, and the singing
                    of "Hail, Columbia!," "A Charge to Keep I Have," and "Bonny Doon"; and
                    recreational reading of Pope's translation of <title>The Iliad</title> and a
                    speech by Union General Carl Shurg, printed in a newspaper that Adelaide E. Case
                    sent to him previously. </p>
