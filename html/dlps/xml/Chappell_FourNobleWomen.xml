<figure id="f2" rend="block" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0016"/>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">In</hi> the brief biographies contained in the following <lb/>
pages, we have endeavoured to set before our <lb/>
readers, as fully as the necessary limits of space <lb/>
would allow, four noble and striking examples of the <lb/>
ministry of women.</p>
<p>The subjects of these memoirs are all women who <lb/>
have lived in our own day, and amid similar social <lb/>
environments to those which surround ourselves; <lb/>
none of them were of remarkably high birth, or <lb/>
possessed of the influence which rank in itself confers <lb/>
on the inheritor; not one of them was endowed with <lb/>
genius in the common acceptation of the term, <lb/>
neither poetry, art, literature, nor the drama, having <lb/>
bestowed its coveted laurels upon any of them; and <lb/>
yet the names of Frances Willard, Agnes Weston, <lb/>
Sister Dora and Catherine Booth will live embalmed <lb/>
in thousands of grateful memories and hearts, when <lb/>
others, famous for more brilliant talent, may haply <lb/>
be forgotten.</p>
<p>But if our four heroines, as they may be called, <lb/>
using the word in its truest sense, were not <reg orig="dis-|tinguished">distinguished</reg> <lb/>
by dazzling intellectual attainments, they <lb/>
<pb n="vi" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0017"/>
surely belong to that great, Divinely-endowed band <lb/>
of whom St. Paul writes in I Cor. xii. 4&ndash;10:&mdash;"To <lb/>
one is given, by the Spirit, the word of wisdom; to <lb/>
another, the word of knowledge, by the same Spirit; <lb/>
to another, faith, by the same Spirit; to another, the <lb/>
gifts of healing." Each cultivated, for the glory of <lb/>
God and the good of her fellow-creatures, the best <lb/>
powers she possessed, and there are none, however <lb/>
humble, who may not do the same.</p>
<p>Although we have in Mrs. Booth an instance of <lb/>
how a busy wife and mother may do a great work <lb/>
in the world without neglecting the nearer claims of <lb/>
husband and home, her companions in this volume <lb/>
furnish notable illustrations of the potential joys and <lb/>
usefulness of spinsterhood.</p>
<p>Thank God, the day is gone by, we believe never <lb/>
to return, when the unmarried woman frittered her <lb/>
years away in pensive dreams of what "might have <lb/>
been," fancying that all that makes life worth living <lb/>
has been denied her, sadly thinking that because she <lb/>
has not been enthroned queen of any man's home, <lb/>
no opportunities of blessing and being blessed can <lb/>
await her, or that, having no little ones of her own <lb/>
about her knee, the mother-heart which sleeps in the <lb/>
bosom of every good woman must for ever be <reg orig="un-|satisfied">unsatisfied</reg>. <lb/>
But if there should linger in the mind of <lb/>
any girl reader of these pages the shadow of a notion <lb/>
that an unmarried woman can never be quite so <lb/>
happy or useful as a wife, we think she will hardly <lb/>
be able to reach the last one without experiencing <lb/>
a change of opinion. The sight of Frances Willard, <lb/>
swaying multitudes towards the choice of liberty and <lb/>
right as with a regal sceptre; of Sister Dora, radiant <lb/>
<pb n="vii" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0018"/>
as an angel of light in the haunts of suffering and <lb/>
vice; or of Miss Weston, mothering her jolly Jack <lb/>
Tars with a heart full of tenderness, and loved as by <lb/>
a thousand noble sons, is enough to dispel any <reg orig="senti-|mental">sentimental</reg> <lb/>
allusion about the emptiness of a single life.</p>
<p>Besides affording instances of the consecration of <lb/>
ordinary gifts and the wonderful possibilities of <lb/>
Christian enthusiasm, these four ladies, each and all, <lb/>
stand out in bold relief as the possessors of strong, <lb/>
but sanctified wills. There was no namby-pamby <lb/>
softness or indecision about any of them. "I will <lb/>
like to do right, and then do as I like," might have <lb/>
been the unspoken motto of every one. A will of <lb/>
one's own is a precious heritage; not to be crushed, <lb/>
or broken, or yielded up to anyone but the Divine <lb/>
Master Himself.</p>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"Our wills are ours, we know not how,</l>
<l>Our wills are ours, to make them Thine."</l>
</lg></q>
<p>Some are fitted by God only to follow and obey <lb/>
those more capable than themselves. Then by all <lb/>
means let these submit with cheerfulness and yield <lb/>
willing obedience; their services will thus be of <reg orig="in-|calculable">incalculable</reg> <lb/>
value. But those who move the world, <lb/>
and leave an impress for good upon future <reg orig="genera-|tions">generations</reg>, <lb/>
are persons of strong convictions and distinct <lb/>
individuality, who, having first learned to control <lb/>
themselves, may safely undertake to command others. <lb/>
If any of us are conscious of possessing a strong will, <lb/>
let us not regard it as a defect, or something to get <lb/>
rid of; let us ask God to sanctify and guide it, then <lb/>
it may prove a glorious gift and a means of service <lb/>
to Him and those around us.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we would express our thanks first of <lb/>
<pb n="viii" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0019"/>
all to Miss Agnes Weston in affording us the means <lb/>
of giving accurate particulars of her life and work, <lb/>
both by permitting extracts from her collaborator, <lb/>
Miss Wintz's interesting book, "Our Blue Jackets," <lb/>
and by kindly undertaking herself to correct statistics, <lb/>
etc., up to the most recent date; and we also <reg orig="ac-|knowledge">acknowledge</reg> <lb/>
our indebtedness as regards the other <lb/>
biographies to Miss Willard's "My Happy <reg orig="Half-|Century">Half-Century</reg>;" <lb/>
to the memoirs of "Sister Dora" by her <lb/>
friends, Miss Lonsdale and Miss Ridsdale; and to <lb/>
the life of Mrs. Booth by her son-in-law, Major <reg orig="Booth-|Tucker">Booth-Tucker</reg>, <lb/>
of the Salvation Army.</p>
<p>If we succeed in inspiring any young reader with <lb/>
a higher sense of the glorious possibilities of a <lb/>
woman's ministry, our pleasant task will not have <lb/>
been in vain.</p>

A SUNNY CHILDHOOD.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Some</hi> children bring sunshine with them when <lb/>
they come into the world, others find it waiting <lb/>
for them; Frances Willard seems to have been <lb/>
one of those few favoured mortals to whose share <lb/>
falls the double portion of brightness&mdash;sunshine <reg orig="with-|in">within</reg> <lb/>
and without.</p>
<p>She was born&mdash;a longed-for and prayed-for little <lb/>
daughter, to fill the aching void left by the early death <lb/>
of a baby sister&mdash;on the 28th of September, 1839, at <lb/>
Churchville, Monroe County, N.Y.</p>
<p>Her father was the son of Elijah Willard, a good <lb/>
New England Puritan pastor, and descended from <lb/>
the Willards who had lived at Horsmonden, in Kent, <lb/>
for nearly six hundred years. He was a man of <lb/>
somewhat severe mould, high-principled, cultured, <lb/>
<pb n="14" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0025"/>
and intellectual, but suffering the life-long <reg orig="disadvan-|tage">disadvantage</reg> <lb/>
of weak physical health.</p>
<p>Mrs. Willard, on the other hand, was blessed with <lb/>
abounding health and spirits, and a rarely lovely <lb/>
disposition. Gifted in many ways beyond the <reg orig="aver-|age">average</reg>, <lb/>
she was yet able to be cheery and contented in <lb/>
circumstances that must often have been sorely <lb/>
uncongenial to her. A poet at heart, her mind was <lb/>
stored with gems from Cowper, Coleridge, Thomson, <lb/>
and others of the same type. Her daughter has <lb/>
recorded that her exquisitely expressive rendering of <lb/>
Wordsworth's "Intimations of Immortality," even at <lb/>
the advanced age of eighty-six, was beyond anything <lb/>
she had elsewhere heard.</p>
<p>The tenderness and spirituality of Mrs. Willard's <lb/>
character equalled its poetry, and although she did <lb/>
not "talk religion" to her children, she taught them <lb/>
of God's great goodness and beauty in all His works, <lb/>
finding Him in every cloud, and flower, and chirping <lb/>
bird; she made them "love the Heart that is at <lb/>
Nature's heart," and when she prayed, she uttered <lb/>
fewer petitions than thanksgivings. "Thou hast <lb/>
done us only good," she would say. "Thou dost <lb/>
brood over us as a mother-bird broods over her <reg orig="help-|less">helpless</reg> <lb/>
little ones." She taught her children gentle <lb/>
manners, but she never restrained their healthy <reg orig="free-|dom">freedom</reg>; <lb/>
she put everything in their way that was good, <lb/>
best of all, a good example, but she never forced or <lb/>
fretted them into following it.</p>
<p>Frances had a brother, Oliver, five years older than <lb/>
herself, and a sister, Mary, who was three years <lb/>
younger. Our heroine was a small and delicate child, <lb/>
bright, clever, and affectionate, as one can easily <lb/>

believe, but physically somewhat slow of <reg orig="develop-|ment">development</reg>; <lb/>
at fifteen she looked more like a girl of <lb/>
twelve.</p>
<p>When she was two years old, the family removed <lb/>
from Churchville to Oberlin, and again, when she was <lb/>
seven, to "Forest Home," an isolated farmstead in <lb/>
Wisconsin.</p>
<p>Here, for twelve happy years, the three young folks <lb/>
lived with Nature. Their father was as passionate a <lb/>
lover of trees and birds and flowers for their own <lb/>
sakes as his wife was for the preciousness of their <lb/>
revelation. He took his children about with him, <lb/>
delighting to teach and interest them in all he <lb/>
knew and cared for himself. Although a scholar and <lb/>
a man of books, Mr. Willard was of so practical a <lb/>
mind, that under his cultivation "Forest Home" <lb/>
became in the course of years the prize farm of the <lb/>
county. Here were sown in Frances' mind the seeds <lb/>
of those temperance principles which were in later <lb/>
years to influence the nation and the world; for no <lb/>
alcoholic beverage of any sort did Mr. Willard allow <lb/>
in his home, or to his field labourers, though a <lb/>
pleasant "harvest drink," compounded of water, <lb/>
molasses and ginger, was supplied to the latter in <lb/>
abundance.</p>
<p>The three children were almost continually out of <lb/>
doors; the girls as far as possible following and <reg orig="imi-|tating">imitating</reg> <lb/>
their big brother in all that he did. They spun <lb/>
tops, they played marbles, they walked on stilts, they <lb/>
climbed trees, they harnessed the horses and milked <lb/>
the cows. They were not, however, allowed to ride. <lb/>
But so great a deprivation did Frances&mdash;or "Frank" <lb/>
to use her home name&mdash;feel this restriction to be, that <lb/>
<pb n="18" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0029"/>
she did not rest satisfied until she had trained a young <lb/>
heifer to wear a saddle and carry a rider!</p>
<p>It is enough to send town children into fits of <lb/>
hopeless longing to read of the lovely times these <lb/>
youngsters had, of the picnics in the woods, whither <lb/>
a toothsome lunch was carried by the goat which <lb/>
Mary possessed as an off-set to Frank's trained cow; <lb/>
of their archery competitions; of the two oaks by the <lb/>
homestead gate, in the branches of which each girl <lb/>
had a snug seat fitted up, a sort of aerial "den" sacred <lb/>
to herself, of the games in the big play-house that <lb/>
was built for them when the barn was being put up <lb/>
of the make-believe fights with "Injuns," and the <lb/>
doings of "The Rustic Club."</p>
<p>These healthful recreations were not only tolerated <lb/>
but actually helped forward by their wise and <reg orig="sym-|pathetic">sympathetic</reg> <lb/>
mother, who allowed each child to develop <lb/>
according to his or her natural bent; while Mary <lb/>
loved housewifely occupations, Frances took more <lb/>
kindly to hammer and nails.</p>
<p>The Willards' nearest visiting neighbours lived <lb/>
about a mile away; these were Mr. and Mrs. Hodge, <lb/>
and their three boys. Mr. Hodge was a Yale College <lb/>
graduate, and had been Latin tutor at Oberlin <lb/>
College, and his wife, a gifted and cultured woman, <lb/>
was Mrs. Willard's greatest friend. But as there were <lb/>
no little girls of suitable age at the Hodges' home, <lb/>
Frank and Mary Willard seem to have had their <lb/>
games chiefly with themselves and their brother.</p>
<p>For indoor amusements they wrote diaries, "edited" <lb/>
papers, drew, painted, and modeled in clay. The <lb/>
laws enacted for the "city" which they planned <lb/>
round and about "Forest Home," and the rules of "The <lb/>
<pb n="19" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0030"/>
Artists" and "The Rustic Club," which they also <lb/>
inaugurated, show a remarkable gift for organising on <lb/>
the part of these bright young people. The city, we <lb/>
may remark &lpar;"Fort City" was its name&rpar; was to have <lb/>
no drinking-saloons. no billiard halls, and of course <lb/>
would require no jail. But whether it ever reached <lb/>
a further stage of development than the laying out of <lb/>
"Broadway" in front of the farmstead gate, by means <lb/>
of digging out with a fire-shovel and paving with <lb/>
bricks and pebbles, and the election of the city <lb/>
officials, history does not relate.</p>
<p>There was something of Puritanical strictness in the <lb/>
way the Sabbath was kept at "Forest Home"; yet such <lb/>
were the simple and natural conditions of life there, <lb/>
that even this does not seem to have pressed hardly <lb/>
upon the children. No work was to be done, of even <lb/>
the most trivial nature, on that day, no books read <lb/>
except such as were of a decidedly religious character, <lb/>
and no calls made or received. This latter precaution <lb/>
seems to have been somewhat unnecessary, for, as <lb/>
Frances says, "there was nobody to come but the <lb/>
birds, and nowhere to go except to the fields and <lb/>
pastures." For the rest, the girls went to church in <lb/>
the town of Janesville every Sunday morning, with <lb/>
their elders by turns, either Mr. Willard, Mrs. Willard, <lb/>
or Oliver always staying at home to mind house and <lb/>
cook the delicious Sunday dinner, which, religious <lb/>
rules notwithstanding, was an institution at "Forest <lb/>
Home."</p>
<p>Later in the day, Mr. Willard thought it no wrong <lb/>
to take his little girls for a pleasant stroll in the <lb/>
pasture, or by the broad, tree-shaded river. Frances, <lb/>
as fond of her jack-knife as any boy, was, however, on <lb/>
<pb n="20" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0031"/>
these occasions allowed to "whittle" only, the <reg orig="fashion-|ing">fashioning</reg> <lb/>
of whistles, or any other of the objects she was so <lb/>
skilful at carving, being for the day prohibited.</p>
<p>On the Sabbath evenings, attendance at Divine <lb/>
worship a second time being precluded by the <reg orig="dis-|tance&mdash;about">distance&mdash;about</reg> <lb/>
four miles&mdash;of this prairie farm from <lb/>
the church, the parents and children would gather <lb/>
together to sing simple old-fashioned hymns from the <lb/>
Methodist hymn-book. Needless to say, Bible-reading <lb/>
and prayers were part of the daily life of the family, <lb/>
but the children were not by any means pushed, much <lb/>
less goaded, into the paths of righteousness; Mrs. <lb/>
Willard believed firmly in prayer, example, and <lb/>
natural development It was her oft-expressed <reg orig="con-|viction">conviction</reg> <lb/>
that every one receives "according to their <lb/>
faith."</p>
<p>The heroine of our sketch was not a pattern of early <lb/>
piety according to conventional ideas. From her <lb/>
infantile days it was instinctive in her, when told <lb/>
anything about God or revelation, to ask "How do <lb/>
you know?" She strongly objected to be talked to <lb/>
on the subject of religion, and was too shy to allow <lb/>
anyone, except perhaps her dearly-loved sister, Mary, <lb/>
to guess when she was even deeply moved. Yet faith <lb/>
and love were surely growing, though hidden, in her <lb/>
childish heart, for years afterwards she remembered <lb/>
stretching out her hand towards the blue sky as she <lb/>
lay on the grass by the river-bank, and saying to her <lb/>
sister, "See there! could you resist a hand that so <lb/>
much wanted to clasp your own? Of course you <lb/>
couldn't, and God cannot, either. I believe that, <lb/>
though I do not see, He reaches down to me."</p>
<p>The love between Frances and Mary, as well as <lb/>
<pb n="21" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0032"/>
between the girls and their kind, good-natured big <lb/>
brother, Oliver, was very great. Frances was ardent <lb/>
and affectionate, Mary, gentle and sweet. Mary's <lb/>
conscience was exceedingly tender, at one time almost <lb/>
morbidly so, but Frank's more vigorous mind helped <lb/>
to balance that of the younger girl. Mutually they <lb/>
agreed to the lovely custom of asking each other's <lb/>
forgiveness, just before going to sleep at night, for <lb/>
anything during the day which had been not quite <lb/>
sisterly and kind, and thanking one another for all <lb/>
that had been good. "I ask your forgiveness and <lb/>
thank you," was the abbreviated formula, to which the <lb/>
answer was, "I freely forgive you, and welcome." <lb/>
This habit was kept up until, after "nineteen beautiful <lb/>
years," came the final "good-night" of sweet Mary's <lb/>
life on earth, and her sister "asked her forgiveness <lb/>
and thanked her" for the last time.</p>
<p>Studying from books formed but a small item in <lb/>
the lives of these "prairie flowers" until Frances was <lb/>
twelve years old. Frances actually could not write <lb/>
her name until she was nine; a little desultory <reg orig="learn-|ing">learning</reg> <lb/>
of lessons and practising of pot-hooks and hangers <lb/>
on winter evenings under their mother's supervision <lb/>
being all the schooling to which they were subjected. <lb/>
But at length, much to their delight, it was arranged <lb/>
that an accomplished young lady, a Miss Burdick, <lb/>
daughter of Colonel Burdick who had recently come <lb/>
to reside in the neighbourhood, should teach them <lb/>
daily in their own home, with the two daughters of <lb/>
another neighbour for companions.</p>
<p>The girls rushed to the joys of study with the <lb/>
keenest zest&mdash;their brother had already, for two winters <lb/>
been attending an academy in Janesville&mdash;and in one <lb/>
<pb n="22" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0033"/>
year, we are assured, learned as much as "little ones <lb/>
are tormented into, now, during seven"! The diaries <lb/>
which they both kept, and Frances' early poems, are <lb/>
sufficient proof that this assertion is not an <reg orig="exagger-|ated">exaggerated</reg> <lb/>
one.</p>
<p>Miss Burdick, though only eighteen years old, was a <lb/>
goddess in the eyes of these little rustic maidens; <lb/>
she taught them singing, drawing, and botany, as well <lb/>
as more prosaic accomplishments; she was not a <lb/>
teacher only, but a dearly-loved companion and <lb/>
friend, and to her Frances confided some of her own <lb/>
longings and aspirations. For by this time the girl's <lb/>
future work was already foreshadowing itself in her <lb/>
yearning, unsuggested by anyone, to write for the <lb/>
press, and even "to speak in public, if she dared." <lb/>
Strange to say, a prophetic instinct, even at thirteen <lb/>
years old, was whispering to Frances Willard that <lb/>
something quite out of the common lot awaited her, <lb/>
and she was wont to tell Miss Burdick that she knew <lb/>
she was "born to a fate." This was no mere youthful <lb/>
bumptiousness, but, we believe, as solemn a calling <lb/>
from Heaven as that of Samuel of old; and in the same <lb/>
spirit of obedience as his, the child lying on the prairie <lb/>
grass would lift her hands towards the sky and say <lb/>
in her inmost heart, "What is it&mdash;what is it that I am <lb/>
to be, O God?"</p>
<p>After two years of "play-school" with Miss Burdick, <lb/>
Mr. Willard and his friend, Mr. Inman, the father of <lb/>
the girls' fellow-scholars, succeeded in getting a small <lb/>
district school-house built about a mile from "Forest <lb/>
Home," and here, according to American custom, were <lb/>
soon assembled most of the young folks of the <lb/>
neighbourhood, boys and girls, gentle and simple, <lb/>
<pb n="23" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0034"/>
under one roof, to benefit by the instructions of Mr. <lb/>
Hodge, now "Professor," who had accepted the post <lb/>
of teacher, and as a graduate of Yale College was well <lb/>
equipped for his task.</p>
<p>This gentleman, who was an Englishman by birth, <lb/>
and rejoiced in the patriotic Christian name of <hi rend="italic">Nelson <lb/>
Wellington</hi>, seems to have been an excellent tutor, <lb/>
but he was replaced after four months by his wife's <lb/>
sister, Mrs. Hovey, whose brightness, geniality, and <lb/>
aptitude to teach "made school just like a play-day" <lb/>
to her fortunate pupils.</p>
<p>But we must linger no longer over Frances Willard's <lb/>
childish days. The last teacher she and her sister <lb/>
had at "Forest Home" was their mother's accomplished <lb/>
sister Sarah, who came on a visit to the prairie farm <lb/>
when Frances was in her early teens; and after her <lb/>
departure, the girls, whose appetites for learning had <lb/>
been keenly whetted, gave their father little peace <lb/>
until he consented to let them go to college.</p>

"WHERE THE BROOK AND RIVER MEET."</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">In</hi> the spring of 1857, Frances, having been by this <lb/>
time unwillingly introduced to hairpins, and <lb/>
inducted into a "hateful new gown" with a long <lb/>
skirt, that precluded all future possibilities of <reg orig="fence-|jumping">fence-jumping</reg> <lb/>
and tree-climbing, went with her sister to <lb/>
Milwaukee Female College, where their Aunt Sarah, <lb/>
mentioned above, was one of the leading teachers.</p>
<p>Ere this, however, our heroine had gained her <lb/>
<pb n="24" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0035"/>
earliest public distinction as winner of the first prize&mdash; <lb/>
a silver medal and a "lovely cup"&mdash;offered by the <lb/>
Illinois Agricultural Society for the best essay on <lb/>
"The Embellishment of a Country Home," for <lb/>
which she had taken her own beautiful home as a <lb/>
model.</p>
<p>She was a restless, adventurous spirit, and much as <lb/>
she loved her kindred with the whole strength of an <lb/>
intensely affectionate nature, the girl longed for a <lb/>
wider horizon and fuller scope for her powers.</p>
<p>Mrs. Willard had said&mdash;and the words are worth <lb/>
writing in letters of gold:&mdash;"To be busy doing <reg orig="some-|thing">something</reg> <lb/>
that is worthy to be done is the happiest thing <lb/>
in all this world for girl or boy, for old or young." So <lb/>
to content her daughter's active mind, opportunities <lb/>
for an advanced course of study were provided, and <lb/>
for a time proved all-sufficient.</p>
<p>The remarkable freedom and independence of <lb/>
Frances' nature was demonstrated when, on her <lb/>
eighteenth birthday&mdash;her "coming of age" according <lb/>
to the American standard&mdash;she being at home for the <lb/>
vacation after her first college term, she coolly <reg orig="com-|menced">commenced</reg> <lb/>
reading "Ivanhoe" before her father's face.</p>
<p>He was at first inclined to be indignant, novels of <lb/>
every description being contraband in "Forest Home"; <lb/>
but when his daughter gravely and respectfully <lb/>
asserted her newly attained right to do what seemed <lb/>
good in her own eyes, he laughed, and contested the <lb/>
point no more.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1858, Frances and Mary <reg orig="com-|menced">commenced</reg> <lb/>
study at the North-Western Female College, <lb/>
Evanston, near Chicago, the best educational <reg orig="estab-|lishment">establishment</reg> <lb/>
for women at that time known.</p>
<pb n="25" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0036"/>
<p>While here, the elder girl was a cause of some <lb/>
anxiety to Professor Jones, the President of the <lb/>
College, who was an earnest Christian, by her <reg orig="appar-|ently">apparently</reg> <lb/>
pronounced sceptical tendencies. Revival <lb/>
meetings took place during her first College term, but <lb/>
after once being over-persuaded by this well-meaning <lb/>
gentleman to go with others "to the altar"&mdash;which <lb/>
we take to be something analogous to the "penitent <lb/>
form" of Salvation Army fame&mdash;the girl's natural <lb/>
honesty asserted itself so far as to prompt her to write <lb/>
the Professor a letter, begging to be excused from <lb/>
taking part in any more of such demonstrations until <lb/>
inwardly conscious of a change of heart.</p>
<p>In this letter she wrote: "If there is a God, a <lb/>
heaven, a hell, a devil, then I am undone. I have <lb/>
been taught to think that all these exist, yet from <lb/>
childhood I have doubted."</p>
<p>Nevertheless, at the same period, the same girl <lb/>
penned these words in her diary:&mdash;"I thank God <lb/>
most that He has made us so that we may make <lb/>
ourselves great, wise, and good, that we may change <lb/>
ourselves in mind from helpless babes to strong, <lb/>
steadfast characters."</p>
<p>No wonder that Professor Jones concluded presently <lb/>
that her "scepticism was of a mild form. Most of all, <lb/>
she doubted all her doubts."</p>
<p>"What a queer girl Frank Willard is!" said one of <lb/>
her companions to him. "She won't confess that she <lb/>
knows or believes anything. She says she doesn't <lb/>
know whether there is a God, and she doesn't know <lb/>
whether the Bible is true; she is trying to find <lb/>
out."</p>
<p>"Don't be distressed, Mattie," the wise man replied. <lb/>
<pb n="26" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0037"/>
"If she will only keep on trying to find out, she will <lb/>
find out. All her friends have to do is to pray that <lb/>
she may persevere."</p>
<p>It was while pursuing her ordinary course of study <lb/>
that light came, and Wayland's "Moral Science," <lb/>
which she was reading in preparation for an <reg orig="examina-|tion">examination</reg>, <lb/>
was, under God, the means of Frances Willard's <lb/>
conversion. On a blank half-page of that volume, <lb/>
her good friend, Professor Jones, was one day <reg orig="over-|joyed">overjoyed</reg> <lb/>
to find this memorandum written by her to <lb/>
meet his eye:&mdash;"When I began this study I could <lb/>
not say whether there was a God or no&mdash;and if <lb/>
there was, whether He cared for me or not. Now, <lb/>
thanks to President Wayland and my faithful <lb/>
instructors, I can say from my heart I believe that <lb/>
there is a God, and that He is my Father."</p>
<p>Shortly after, the brave and earnest-hearted girl <lb/>
voluntarily made her public confession of faith&mdash;not <lb/>
under the excitement and pressure of a revival <lb/>
meeting, but on one quiet Sunday evening, when, <lb/>
the pastor having at the close of an ordinary service <lb/>
asked any who wished to unite with the church on <lb/>
probation to meet him at the altar, she alone of the <lb/>
whole congregation responded.</p>
<p>This was the beginning of a steady Christian life, <lb/>
which deepened, brightened, and unfolded year by year.</p>
<p>As a school-girl, Frances was popular both on <lb/>
account of her intellectual gifts and her buoyant <lb/>
spirits. A companion of these college <reg orig="days&mdash;after-|wards">days&mdash;afterwards</reg> <lb/>
a dearly-loved sister-in-law&mdash;says: "It was <lb/>
but a few weeks till she was editor of the College <lb/>
paper, and leader of all the intellectual forces among <lb/>
the students.&hellip; She was an inventor of sport, and <lb/>
<pb n="27" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0038"/>
her ingenuity devised many an amusement which <lb/>
was not all amusement, but which involved <reg orig="consider-|able">considerable</reg> <lb/>
exercise of wit and intelligence&mdash;and our beloved <lb/>
Professor soon found that he could always rely upon <lb/>
her influence in the school to counteract the tendency <lb/>
to silly escapades and moonlight walks with the <lb/>
University boys.&hellip; If one of those school-mates <lb/>
had been called upon to sum up in a sentence a <lb/>
rough estimate of her friend, she would probably at <lb/>
this period have given as her opinion, 'She's the <lb/>
leader of all sport among the girls, and doesn't care a <lb/>
snap for the boys.'"</p>
<p>Early in the autumn of 1858 the Willard family <lb/>
let their beloved "Forest Home," and removed to <lb/>
Evanston, Mrs. Willard, from certain revelations made <lb/>
by Frances as to the temptations of college life, <reg orig="fear-|ing">fearing</reg> <lb/>
to let her daughters be so far from their parents' <lb/>
oversight and care.</p>
<p>The last year at school was one of great strain for <lb/>
the ardent young student, and she twice broke down <lb/>
in health before graduation&mdash;the goal of her ambitions <lb/>
&mdash;was triumphantly reached. This, however, was <lb/>
attained in the summer of 1859, and passionately as <lb/>
she loved learning, and affectionately as she regarded <lb/>
both teachers and class-mates, such was Frances' <lb/>
natural repugnance to rule and restraint, that she said <lb/>
farewell to college life with joy.</p>
<p>The diary of Frances Willard's first year out of <lb/>
school is full of such noble aspirations and desires as <lb/>
we should expect to be the flower-buds of the life <lb/>
that followed. Particularly did she yearn to become <lb/>
more loving and gentle, and to be of use and comfort <lb/>
in the world.</p>
<pb n="28" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0039"/>
<p>"Ask the mighty, infinite Helper," she exhorts <lb/>
herself in a written soliloquy, "to model you by His <lb/>
plans, <hi rend="italic">let them be what they will</hi>, so that every year <lb/>
you may grow 'calmer and calmer,' richer in love and <lb/>
peacefulness, and forgetting the poor dreams of less <lb/>
thoughtful years, have this, and this only, for your <lb/>
ambition: to be gentle, kindly, and forgiving, full of <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">charity</hi> which suffereth long, and patience which is <lb/>
pleasing in the sight of God and man."</p>
<p>And again:&mdash;"I have resolved that neither public <lb/>
opinion, nor narrow-minded pride, nor any other <lb/>
creature, shall prevent me from showing, whenever <lb/>
I can, kindness as delicate and respect as genuine as <lb/>
I know how, to those whom the community, as a rule, <lb/>
treats slightingly or with positive neglect. If I do <lb/>
this, I shall be of value to the world, whether the <lb/>
world knows it or not. I shall, I think, bring some <lb/>
happiness into troubled and wounded hearts, and, oh, <lb/>
will it not be sweet to remember in the hour when <lb/>
I shall most need comfort, the hour in which I am to <lb/>
die!"</p>
<p>But the young eaglet could not be quiet for long in <lb/>
the home nest. Frances' inborn love of freedom and <lb/>
variety, not by any means to be confused with <lb/>
changeableness or fickleness, prompted her once more <lb/>
to crave to be on the wing. Anticipating opposition <lb/>
from her father, who was well able to support her in <lb/>
comfort, and did not consider that women ought to <lb/>
want to earn money, she did the deed on her own <lb/>
responsibility, and confessed afterwards. She accepted <lb/>
the post of teacher at a small school-house on the <lb/>
borders of the prairie, some ten miles from home.</p>
<p>Here, at the village of Harlem, she tried her <lb/>
<pb n="29" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0040"/>
'prentice hand on some very rough material, and first <lb/>
learned what home-sickness meant. Still a child in <lb/>
heart and nature, she pathetically confided to her <lb/>
diary her earnest resolutions "not to cry" over her <lb/>
difficulties, but to remember her age. But she seems <lb/>
all the while to be conscious of weakness or <reg orig="undevelop-|ment">undevelopment</reg> <lb/>
of character, which she heroically set herself to <lb/>
remedy.</p>
<p>"I am twenty years old," she writes, "and I have <lb/>
neither dignity nor womanliness.&hellip; I am neither <lb/>
self-reliant nor self-contained.&hellip; I have never been <lb/>
out in the world, have had no care or trouble, no grief <lb/>
worth mentioning, no 'lovyer,' as my brother says, <lb/>
nor any love affair to sober me.&hellip; I see clearly <lb/>
that I shall never be the grown-up person that I ought <lb/>
to be until I have borne sorrows and had cares."</p>
<p>Poor little girl! A greater sorrow than she ever <lb/>
dreamed possible was slowly but surely creeping <lb/>
towards her along the sunny path of the future.</p>
<p>After a few months' experience at Harlem, <reg orig="fol-|lowed">followed</reg> <lb/>
by a holiday at home, Frances went as assistant <lb/>
teacher to an academy at the town of Kankakee, <lb/>
about sixty miles from Chicago, but owing to the <lb/>
urgent wishes of her parents, remained there only one <lb/>
term.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1861 she taught Harlem school <lb/>
again for a few weeks, and in the following year, <lb/>
living at home, she was employed at the public <lb/>
school of Evanston. It was about this period that <lb/>
Miss Willard was secretly engaged for some months <lb/>
to a young divinity student named Fowler. Years <lb/>
later, she expressed a wish that this little romance <lb/>
might be made known after her death, as she "believed <lb/>
<pb n="30" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0041"/>
it might contribute to a better understanding between <lb/>
good men and women."</p>
<p>This engagement was entered into "on the <reg orig="sup-|position">supposition</reg> <lb/>
that an intellectual comradeship was sure to <lb/>
deepen into unity of heart." But the young couple <lb/>
discovered in time that they were really too much <lb/>
alike for mutual happiness, both displaying marked <lb/>
strength of character and natural powers of <reg orig="leader-|ship">leadership</reg>. <lb/>
In consequence, this love affair, the only <lb/>
episode of its kind, we believe, which occurred in the <lb/>
life of the charming woman of whom Mr. Stead has <lb/>
said that "women loved and men adored her" came <lb/>
to an untimely end, and Frances Willard's spirit <lb/>
remained free to the last of her days.</p>
<p>In June, 1862, came the first great sorrow of our <lb/>
heroine's life.</p>
<p>We have not had space in this brief memoir to <lb/>
accord more than a passing mention to that lovely <lb/>
young sister whose brief biography Miss Willard <lb/>
herself has so touchingly told in "Nineteen Beautiful <lb/>
Years." But the record of an almost cloudless <reg orig="child-|hood">childhood</reg> <lb/>
and girlhood closes with those three <reg orig="heart-break-|ing">heart-break-ing</reg> <lb/>
words in Frances' diary, <hi rend="italic">"Mary is dead</hi>," and the <lb/>
sun never shone for her with undimmed radiance <lb/>
again.</p>

MISS WILLARD AS A TEACHER.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Shortly</hi> after the death of Mary Willard, the <lb/>
Evanston home was broken up, Mr. and Mrs. <lb/>
Willard going first to Janesville and then to Chicago, <lb/>
<pb n="31" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0042"/>
and Oliver, their son, who married in July, 1862, <lb/>
settling in Denver, Colorado. Frances for a time <lb/>
taught the natural sciences at the North-Western <lb/>
Female College, but was getting into a very low and <lb/>
listless state of both mind and body, when a friend, <lb/>
the wife of Bishop Simpson, rescued her out of it by <lb/>
the proposition, backed by the offer of the Bishop <lb/>
himself, that she should try her fortune at the <reg orig="Pitts-|burg">Pittsburg</reg> <lb/>
Female College, of which he was President on <lb/>
the Board of Trustees.</p>
<p>Nothing particularly worthy of record here seems <lb/>
to have taken place during the months spent at <lb/>
Pittsburg. The diaries of this time are deeply tinged <lb/>
with the sadness of bereavement and loneliness. <lb/>
"I have the feeling," she writes, "of one who walks <lb/>
blindfold among scenes too awful for his nerves to <lb/>
bear, in the midst of which we eat and drink, wash <lb/>
our faces, and complain that the fire won't burn in the <lb/>
grate, or that the tea-bell doesn't ring in season.&hellip; <lb/>
We are like a spider's web in some remote angle of <lb/>
St Peter's Cathedral. I suppose the cunning insects <lb/>
flurry greatly if a gnat flies past without being <lb/>
entrapped! All that appertains to the building from <lb/>
floor to dome is accidental in their sight."</p>
<p>On her return to her father and mother and <reg orig="Evans-|ton">Evanston</reg> <lb/>
in the summer vacation, Frances busied herself in <lb/>
writing that memoir of her sister to which we have <lb/>
already alluded. The manuscript, when finished, <lb/>
she herself carried to New York, under the escort of <lb/>
one of her father's friends, Mr. Willard's old-world <lb/>
notions as to the undesirability of publicity for women <lb/>
once more being overborne by his go-ahead and <lb/>
independent-spirited daughter. On her way thither, <lb/>
<pb n="32" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0043"/>
Frances saw the Falls of Niagara, and congratulates <lb/>
herself that she "did not drop into poetry, nor yet <lb/>
into prose, in the presence of that gleaming mystery."</p>
<p>The winter of 1865 finds the subject of our <reg orig="mono-|graph">monograph</reg> <lb/>
teaching the Grove School at Evanston, a select <lb/>
establishment founded by Mr. Edward Haskin, chiefly <lb/>
for the benefit of his own six children. Miss Willard's <lb/>
pupils here were "the best-born and best-mannered <lb/>
children at Evanston, kindly, quick-witted, and <lb/>
studious," and among them she first tried her <reg orig="dis-|ciplinary">disciplinary</reg> <lb/>
plan of "The Bank of Character."</p>
<p>The method was this. She opened an account with <lb/>
each student in her room, and put down certain <lb/>
balances in his favour. "Then by a system of cards <lb/>
of different values, which were interchangeable, as are <lb/>
our bank notes of different denominations, that is, <lb/>
one of a higher value being equivalent to several of a <lb/>
lower denomination, the plan was carried out. Every <lb/>
absence, tardiness, failure in recitation, case of <reg orig="whis-|pering">whispering</reg>, <lb/>
was subtracted from the bank account; and <lb/>
so emulous were those children, that my tallest boys <lb/>
were as much on the <hi rend="italic">qui vive</hi> to know their standing <lb/>
as were their youngest brothers."</p>
<p>In speaking of this time in after years, Miss Willard <lb/>
adds:&mdash;"As I grow older, however, I doubt more and <lb/>
more the propriety of offering prizes. Competition is <lb/>
so fierce in this country and age, and the 'set' of <lb/>
children's brains is so strong towards it from the first, <lb/>
that I have become an ardent believer in co-operation <lb/>
as a principle destined some day to overthrow the <lb/>
selfishness of competition, and, with my present views, <lb/>
would hardly re-enact the scenes that made the 'last <lb/>
day' so exciting at that school."</p>
<pb n="33" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0044"/>
<p>In the spring of 1866, owing to the development of <lb/>
the public school enterprise, Grove School, though <lb/>
eminently successful, ceased to exist, and once again <lb/>
Frances Willard went among strangers.</p>
<p>This time the scene of her labours was the town of <lb/>
Lima, Livingston Co., N.Y., and she was accompanied <lb/>
by her friend, Miss Kate Jackson, for whom she had <lb/>
secured the promise of French classes in the same <lb/>
place.</p>
<p>Here she seems to have been very comfortable, for <lb/>
she wrote, after the confession, which to us, looking <lb/>
at her history as a whole, is scarcely needed, that she <lb/>
was "an inveterate lover of variety":&mdash;"My life is a <lb/>
free and happy one&mdash;surfacely so. How strangely <lb/>
accommodating are our natures! With nothing just <lb/>
as I wish it; with chasms and voids in my life too <lb/>
numerous to name, I yet have a good time, and no <lb/>
complaint to make."</p>
<p>Still, "Change is our portion here" might have <lb/>
been the burden of Miss Willard's song. The greater <lb/>
part of 1867 was spent at home, helping to nurse her <lb/>
father in his long, last illness.</p>
<p>He died in January, 1868, full of joy and peace, <lb/>
and soon after this second bereavement, Frances <lb/>
willingly agreed to the proposal of her friend, Kate <lb/>
Jackson, that the two should together make the tour <lb/>
of Europe at the expense of the latter.</p>
<p>Thus it came about that for the next two years our <lb/>
heroine had the pleasure and advantage of traveling <lb/>
and studying abroad. The pair went through nearly <lb/>
every European country; northward "as far as <reg orig="Hel-|singfors">Helsingfors</reg>, <lb/>
Finland; east as far as the Volga banks in <lb/>
Russia, and Damascus in Syria; making the tour of <lb/>
<pb n="34" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0045"/>
Palestine, and going south far enough to look over <lb/>
into Nubia on earth, and up into the Southern Cross <lb/>
in the heavens."</p>
<p>While in Paris, Miss Willard studied under Guizot <lb/>
the younger, Laboulaye, and Chevalier.</p>
<p>It was very soon after her return that Miss Willard <lb/>
was induced to make her first attempt at lecturing in <lb/>
public. A gentleman who had heard her relate, at <lb/>
the meetings of the Women's Foreign. Missionary <lb/>
Society at Chicago, some of her experiences in Egypt <lb/>
and the Holy Land, was struck with her evident gift <lb/>
for public speaking, and begged her to get up a <lb/>
lecture, for the success of which he would take the <lb/>
responsibility, offering her fifty dollars as prepayment.</p>
<p>Much as Miss Willard had longed for such an <lb/>
opportunity, she felt, now it had arrived, a little <lb/>
"By all means, my child, accept; enter every open <lb/>
door." So, for the next few weeks, Frances was <lb/>
busily engaged writing and committing to memory a <lb/>
lecture on the subject that was nearest to her heart&mdash; <lb/>
that of the right of woman to "a fair chance to be all <lb/>
that God gave her power to be,"</p>
<p>She called this lecture "The New Chivalry," and it <lb/>
was a great success, winning most flattering notices <lb/>
from the Chicago press.</p>
<p>The next important event in our heroine's life was <lb/>
her election to the position of President of the new <lb/>
Women's College at Evanston.</p>
<p>This institution, in which was merged the "<reg orig="North-|Western">North-Western</reg> <lb/>
Female College," where the sisters Willard <lb/>
had graduated some years before, was to be a thorough <lb/>
woman's college, "in which women should constitute <lb/>
<pb n="35" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0046"/>
the Board of Trustees, a woman should be president <lb/>
and confer diplomas, and women should be, for the <lb/>
first time, recognized and proved as the peers of men <lb/>
in administrative power."</p>
<p>It was opened in 1872, and here Miss Willard <lb/>
further developed her "Bank of Character" system <lb/>
of maintaining order. Filled with an instinctive <reg orig="ab-|horrence">abhorrence</reg> <lb/>
of rules and regulations herself, she heartily <lb/>
sympathised with girls of similarly independent spirit, <lb/>
and organised on their behalf her <hi rend="italic">"Roll of Honour"</hi> <lb/>
and "<hi rend="italic">Self-Governed</hi>" Societies.</p>
<p>The basis of this mode of discipline was, as she <lb/>
explained to parents and guardians, that "rules are <lb/>
for the unruly and regulations for the irregular," and <lb/>
the condition of being "not under the law, but under <lb/>
grace," the goal to be aimed at by every scholar. The <lb/>
ideal set before each pupil was, <hi rend="italic">"Just be a Christian <lb/>
Lady</hi>."</p>
<p>One month's absolute freedom from any occasion <lb/>
for reproof entitled a girl to have her name inscribed <lb/>
upon the Roll of Honour, and to be "invested with <lb/>
certain powers and responsibilities usually restricted <lb/>
to the faculty." After one entire term upon the Roll <lb/>
of Honour, uninterrupted by a single misdemeanour, <lb/>
she would be promoted to the ranks of the "<reg orig="Self-|Governed">Self-Governed</reg>," <lb/>
whose honours and privileges were, of <lb/>
course, proportionately greater.</p>
<p>The success of this original experiment was proved <lb/>
by the fact that at the end of one year twelve girls <lb/>
were on the Self-Governed List, and <hi rend="italic">all the others</hi> <lb/>
upon the Roll of Honour.</p>
<p>These were joyous days for the bright and <reg orig="dearly-|loved">dearly-loved</reg> <lb/>
President, who has herself laid it down as an <lb/>
<pb n="36" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0047"/>
axiom that "the highest form of human occupation <lb/>
is doing good according to a plan."</p>
<p>She had all the young ladies, numbering several <lb/>
hundreds, in her English Composition classes, one <lb/>
popular feature of which was reporting for the Chicago <lb/>
and Evanston papers; she lectured to her Art classes <lb/>
with the aid of numbers of beautiful photographic and <lb/>
stereoscopic views which she and Miss Jackson had <lb/>
brought home with them from their European travels; <lb/>
she opened and closed her recitations with a few <lb/>
words of prayer; a missionary society was organised <lb/>
in the College, and a short daily prayer-meeting, <lb/>
though voluntary, was "overwhelmingly attended."</p>
<p>One of her pupils at that time, afterwards the wife <lb/>
of a college president, thus says:&mdash;"In the most <lb/>
important part of her work as an educator&mdash;the <lb/>
development of character&mdash;I can speak from the most <lb/>
intimate knowledge. In this I doubt if she ever had <lb/>
a superior, and but for Arnold of Rugby I should <lb/>
have said, an equal. Her power over the girls who <lb/>
came under her influence was most extraordinary. <lb/>
It is an amusing fact that some people regarded it <lb/>
with a mixture of wonder and fear as something a <lb/>
little allied to witchcraft&mdash;an inexplicable spell not <lb/>
founded on reason."</p>
<p>But this halcyon period was too bright to last.</p>
<p>Dr. Haven, with whom, as President of the <reg orig="North-|Western">North-Western</reg> <lb/>
University, Miss Willard had so unanimously <lb/>
worked, was elected to fill another position, and his <lb/>
place was taken by the Rev. Dr. Fowler.</p>
<p>This gentleman did not entirely sympathise with <lb/>
Miss Willard's views as to "self-government," and <lb/>
friction was caused which eventually resulted in our <lb/>
<pb n="37" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0048"/>
heroine feeling that resignation of her appointment <lb/>
was her only course.</p>
<p>This, which she called the "greatest sacrifice" her <lb/>
life had known, or even could know, was made, after <lb/>
due deliberation and much anguish of spirit, in the <lb/>
summer of 1874, and its immediate outcome was the <lb/>
opening of the way for the greatest work of Frances <lb/>
Willard's life.</p>

the Women's Temperance Crusade, and it was not <lb/>
long after Frances cut herself adrift from her work at <lb/>
Evanston University that, her anti-liquor sympathies <lb/>
being well known, she was offered and accepted the <lb/>
post of corresponding secretary to the Women's <lb/>
Christian Temperance Union.</p>
<p>Her first practical connection with the crusade was <lb/>
when, in Pittsburg, she walked with the procession <lb/>
of women, many of them ladies of birth and culture, <lb/>
who undertook to visit every drinking-saloon in the <lb/>
city, and sing hymns and pray outside its doors, or <lb/>
inside, if allowed.</p>
<p>On this occasion, the leader of the band having read <lb/>
a psalm at the bar of a saloon they had been <reg orig="per-|mitted">permitted</reg> <lb/>
to enter, Miss Willard was requested by her, <lb/>
after the singing of the "Rock of Ages," to offer up <lb/>
<pb n="38" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0049"/>
prayer; and she there and then knelt down in the <lb/>
sawdust on the floor, and feeling "not the least <reg orig="re-|luctance">reluctance</reg>," <lb/>
prayed more truly than she had ever done <lb/>
in her life before, except perhaps, she says, at her <lb/>
sister Mary's dying bed.</p>
<p>This was Miss Willard's "crusade baptism;" soon <lb/>
after she was appointed president of the Chicago <lb/>
W.C.T.U.</p>
<p>Declining the pecuniary assistance offered her, she, <lb/>
fired by the example of St. Francis d'Assisi, whom she <lb/>
greatly admired, for some months endeavoured to hold <lb/>
this position entirely without salary, dependent for her <lb/>
daily bread upon the small collections which were <lb/>
occasionally taken at her lectures, etc.</p>
<p>Her mother, though she did not entirely approve <lb/>
of this mendicant-friar business, did not first <reg orig="dis-|courage">discourage</reg> <lb/>
her daughter's romantic method; may we <lb/>
hint that, perhaps she knew from experience that <lb/>
opposition would have been of little use. But <reg orig="by-|and-by">by-and-by</reg> <lb/>
when Frances went home, literally half-starved, <lb/>
almost shoeless, and downright ill from over-work <lb/>
and privation, she talked common-sense to her in the <lb/>
following strain:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I believe in faith as much as you do, but you <lb/>
have, with pure intention, yet ignorantly, flown in the <lb/>
face of Providence. Those good women spoke to you <lb/>
about a maintenance the very day they chose you <lb/>
president. That was your Heavenly Father's kind <lb/>
provision, and you turned away from it, and dictated <lb/>
to Him the method of His care.&hellip; God isn't going <lb/>
to start loaves of bread flying down the chimney, nor <lb/>
set the fire going in my stove without fuel. I shall <lb/>
soon see the bottom of my flour-barrel and coal-bin. <lb/>

<pb entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0051"/>
<pb n="41" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0052"/>
Now write to those temperance women a plain <reg orig="state-|ment">statement</reg> <lb/>
of facts, and tell them that you have made the <lb/>
discovery that God works by means, and they may <lb/>
help you if they like."</p>
<p>Frances' letter to her comrades produced at once a <lb/>
loving response, with a cheque for 100 dollars <reg orig="en-|closed">enclosed</reg>. <lb/>
She saw her mistake; nevertheless, she <lb/>
always maintained that the period of her somewhat <lb/>
quixotic "faith test" was the loveliest and most <lb/>
blessed of her whole life. "I enjoyed the episode," <lb/>
she writes, "and shall be the better and richer for it <lb/>
evermore."</p>
<p>After working, writing, and speaking for two years <lb/>
in the interest of the Chicago &lpar;now advanced to the <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">National</hi>&rpar; W.C.T.U., it was borne in upon Miss <lb/>
Willard's mind that she was to "speak for woman's <lb/>
ballot, as a weapon of protection to her home and <lb/>
tempted loved ones from the tyranny of drink;" and <lb/>
she at once proposed to colleagues that her she should <lb/>
do so.</p>
<p>The idea was, however, met at first with much <lb/>
opposition. As one influential lady said, "We do <lb/>
not purpose to trail our skirts through the mire of <lb/>
politics."</p>
<p>In 1877, Miss Willard went to Washington, and <lb/>
there spoke before the House Committee on Judiciary, <lb/>
"urging the claims of the Home Protection Petition <lb/>
adopted at Newark, asking that, in the territories and <lb/>
the District of Columbia, the sale of alcoholic drinks <lb/>
should be legalised only 'when the majority of men <lb/>
by their votes, and women by their signatures, should <lb/>
ask for the legalising of such sale.'"</p>
<p>On her return to Chicago she undertook to go with <lb/>
<pb n="42" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0053"/>
the famous evangelist, Dwight L. Moody, to Boston, <lb/>
and help him with the women's meetings there.</p>
<p>In this cultured city Miss Willard held a daily <lb/>
Bible-reading for women, sometimes with an <reg orig="atten-|dance">attendance</reg> <lb/>
of a thousand or even fourteen hundred persons; <lb/>
and once she actually preached in Mr. Moody's <reg orig="taber-|nacle">tabernacle</reg> <lb/>
on a Sunday afternoon. Here also she became <lb/>
acquainted with Miss Bessie Gordon, and her sister, <lb/>
Anna, who was destined to be Miss Willard's <reg orig="com-|panion">companion</reg> <lb/>
and secretary for many subsequent years.</p>
<p>All went well, until our heroine was taken to task <lb/>
by the evangelist for appearing on a temperance <lb/>
platform with a lady who was known to hold <reg orig="Uni-|tarian">Unitarian</reg> <lb/>
views.</p>
<p>Miss Willard was too large of heart and broad <lb/>
of mind to submit readily to such a restriction as this. <lb/>
She wrote to him, after due consideration, a letter on <lb/>
the subject, of which this is the gist&mdash;"I fail to see <lb/>
that it is for us to decide who shall work in this cause <lb/>
side by side with us, and who shall not I cannot <lb/>
judge how the hearts of earnest, pure, prayerful <lb/>
women may appear in God's clear sight"</p>
<p>This liberality of thought reminds us of her reply <lb/>
to the question whether she condemned theatres, or <lb/>
those who go to them. "I do not condemn anyone," <lb/>
she said, "who with a clear and enlightened <reg orig="con-|science">conscience</reg> <lb/>
goes anywhere."</p>
<p>Once again, as many times before and after, <lb/>
Miss Willard found that she must, in following the <lb/>
dictates of her own judgment run counter to the <lb/>
advice of some of her most valued friends. These <lb/>
thought that in disconnecting herself from Mr. <lb/>
Moody she was letting slip a splendid opportunity <lb/>
<pb n="43" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0054"/>
for extending the work of the W.C.T.U. But their <lb/>
arguments were of no avail. Freedom&mdash;that liberty <lb/>
of thought, speech, and action which she was ever <lb/>
ready to fight for and accord to others&mdash;was to <lb/>
Frances Willard as the breath of life. "The jacket," <lb/>
she writes &lpar;of Mr. Moody's theological <reg orig="interpreta-|tions&rpar;">interpretations&rpar;</reg> <lb/>
"was too straight. I could not wear it."</p>
<p>It was in 1877, at the Annual Convention at <lb/>
Chicago, that the now world-famed "white ribbon" <lb/>
was first adopted as the badge of the W.C.T.U., the <lb/>
colour being emblematic of purity and peace, on the <lb/>
principle of "first pure, then peaceable."</p>
<p>At the same Convention, Miss Willard for a time <lb/>
resigned the corresponding secretaryship of this <lb/>
Society, owing to the nomination of an alternative <lb/>
candidate for the post, a greatly respected friend of her <lb/>
own, whom she did not choose to oppose. But the <lb/>
following year the White Ribbon Regiment of Illinois <lb/>
placed her at its head, and entering at once upon <lb/>
their Home Protection campaign, they in nine weeks <lb/>
collected nearly two hundred thousand signatures to a <lb/>
petition that women should be accorded the privilege <lb/>
of voting when the question of licensing the sale of <lb/>
intoxicating drinks was being anywhere discussed.</p>
<p>This petition produced no effect upon the <reg orig="legis-|lature">legislature</reg>, <lb/>
but it so aroused the people, that out of 832 <lb/>
towns voting that spring under the local option law, <lb/>
625 declared themselves for prohibition, which the <lb/>
White Ribboners felt to be worth striving for.</p>
<p>Just about this period came a third severed <reg orig="bereave-|ment">bereavement</reg> <lb/>
upon Miss Willard, very suddenly, in the death, <lb/>
after only a day or two of apparently slight <reg orig="indisposi-|tion">indisposition</reg>, <lb/>
of her beloved brother, Oliver.</p>
<pb n="44" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0055"/>
<p>This gentleman, "of whose great gifts and genial <lb/>
nature," writes his sister, "I can never say enough," <lb/>
had for some years occupied the responsible position <lb/>
of editor, first of the <hi rend="italic">Chicago Mail</hi>,and afterwards of <lb/>
the <hi rend="italic">Chicago Post</hi>.</p>
<p>The news of his death was conveyed in a telegram <lb/>
to Miss Willard just as she was preparing to conduct <lb/>
a temperance prayer-meeting at the town of Saginaw, <lb/>
Michigan, which she was visiting at the time. It <lb/>
would be impossible for her to get a train for Chicago <lb/>
until an hour which would permit of the fulfilment of <lb/>
her engagement first, if she so desired, and thinking, <lb/>
"<hi rend="italic">He</hi> would have wished me to do this," the heroic <lb/>
woman mastered her first passion of grief sufficiently <lb/>
to go to the prayer-meeting as appointed, where <lb/>
she and her audience, whom she told of her sorrow, <lb/>
"cried together, praying and talking of a better life, <lb/>
which is a heavenly."</p>
<p>On returning home, Miss Willard at once took <lb/>
upon herself, with her widowed sister-in-law, the task <lb/>
of continuing the superintendence of the editors, <lb/>
reporters, proof-readers, compositors, etc., a force of <lb/>
more than sixty persons in all, who were engaged in <lb/>
the production of the <hi rend="italic">Chicago Evening Post</hi>.</p>
<p>It was a stupendous undertaking for two women, <lb/>
neither of whom possessed any editorial experience, <lb/>
and, in spite of all their hard work and energy, it had, <lb/>
in a short time, to be relinquished, and stands out <lb/>
conspicuously in Miss Willard's history as the only <lb/>
positive failure among all her efforts.</p>
<p>After this, she started on a Temperance tour in the <lb/>
South, where having, as a Northerner, been prepared <lb/>
for somewhat scant sympathy, she was amazed and <lb/>
<pb n="45" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0056"/>
delighted by the cordiality of her reception; indeed, it <lb/>
would appear from the records of that royal progress <lb/>
through nearly one hundred towns and cities of the <lb/>
South, that the people were even more readily <reg orig="respon-|sive">responsive</reg> <lb/>
to the appeals of Miss Willard and her helpers <lb/>
than in the more cool-blooded and beer-ridden North. <lb/>
She felt that the breach left by the war between the <lb/>
two halves of the great American continent could be <lb/>
by nothing so well bridged over as by the uniting <lb/>
of the temperance men of both North and South in <lb/>
voting for the prohibition of the liquor traffic.</p>
<p>In 1881, Miss Willard resolved to identify herself <lb/>
unreservedly with the Prohibition party, whether <lb/>
composed mainly of Republicans or Democrats. <lb/>
Although hitherto her sympathies had been staunchly <lb/>
Republican, she now felt that the cause of Home <lb/>
Protection and the Prohibition of the drink traffic <lb/>
was of greater moral importance than anything else, <lb/>
and, with many others of similar convictions, she <lb/>
retired from the Republican party to become a <lb/>
member of the Central committee of the newly <reg orig="re-|organised">reorganised</reg> <lb/>
"Prohibition Home Protection Party." <lb/>
In her official address to the W.C.T.U. she eloquently <lb/>
pleaded with its members to throw the whole weight <lb/>
of their influence into the same balance.</p>
<p>Much time and energy in 1883 were expended by <lb/>
Miss Willard in completing the visitation of every <lb/>
one of the forty-eight States in the Union, with every <lb/>
town therein which had, according to the census of <lb/>
1870, 10,000 inhabitants, and many much smaller ones.</p>
<p>This grand tour was finished in the autumn of the <lb/>
above year, an event which was celebrated at Detroit <lb/>
with great rejoicings.</p>
<pb n="46" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0057"/>
<p>Then another expansion of the W.C.T.U. was <lb/>
decided upon, and it became the "<hi rend="italic">World's</hi> Woman's <lb/>
Christian Temperance Union," of which gigantic <lb/>
Union Miss Willard in due course became President, <lb/>
a position she held until her death. The <reg orig="ramifica-|tions">ramifications</reg> <lb/>
of this great force were extended by degrees <lb/>
to Australia, India, China, Madeira, Madagascar, <lb/>
Siam, Straits Settlements, Corea, Japan, and, in fact, <lb/>
everywhere.</p>
<p>During the next few years Miss Willard's life is <lb/>
the story of a noble, persistent struggle on the part <lb/>
of herself and the Union which she represented, to <lb/>
gain the ear and the sympathy of the legislature. <lb/>
Meetings were held, speeches made, petitions framed <lb/>
at every possible opportunity. But smaller matters <lb/>
relating to the freedom and welfare of home and <lb/>
woman, were not overlooked; as an example, witness <lb/>
the petition adopted by the St Louis Convention <lb/>
and sent to the editors of fashion-papers, begging <lb/>
them to discountenance in their pages such plates <lb/>
as represented and encouraged unnatural constriction <lb/>
of the waist, and lend their "aid toward the elevation <lb/>
of woman to a more perfect physical estate" by <lb/>
making the figures depicted "conform more nearly <lb/>
to the normal standard and the conditions requisite <lb/>
for the maintenance of health."</p>
<p>Miss Willard was always an earnest advocate of <lb/>
the duty of endeavouring to preserve a sound body <lb/>
as the garment of a sound mind. Busy as was her <lb/>
life she contrived to maintain a wise regularity of <lb/>
habit, which, considering her natural delicacy of <lb/>
physique, probably contributed not a little towards <lb/>
the lengthening of her life until a fair middle age, <lb/>
<pb n="47" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0058"/>
while both her sister and her brother, doubtless <lb/>
inheriting with her their father's weakness of <reg orig="con-|stitution">constitution</reg>, <lb/>
died without numbering half their days.</p>
<p>"My rising-hour," she writes, "has long been from <lb/>
seven to half-past &lpar;I wish it were earlier!&rpar; and retiring <lb/>
anywhere from half-past seven to half-past nine; but <lb/>
when travelling, it has been about ten. I regard <lb/>
that hour as the dead line of recuperation, vigour, <lb/>
and sustained mental activity. Eight hours of <lb/>
writing and study, all of them between breakfast <lb/>
and tea, has been my rule. After the evening meal <lb/>
at six o'clock I will not work&mdash;lecturing, of course, <lb/>
excepted. I expect, as a rule, to sit at my desk from <lb/>
8.30 or 9 <hi rend="small-caps">a.m</hi>. until 6 <hi rend="small-caps">p.m</hi>. daily, with a half-hour's <lb/>
interval from 12.30 to 1, and an outing; of about <reg orig="half-|an-hour">half-an-hour</reg> <lb/>
I never touch the pen after tea, and ten <lb/>
o'clock finds our house dark as a pocket, silent as <lb/>
a tomb, and restful as a cradle."</p>
<p>It is a noteworthy fact that Miss Willard never <lb/>
in all her life suffered from insomnia. She calls <lb/>
herself "one of the seven sleepers," and even in the <lb/>
trying and exciting days of endeavouring to keep up <lb/>
her brother's newspaper, the anxiety never deprived <lb/>
her of her ability to rest at night.</p>
<p>It was in 1891 that our heroine first became <lb/>
acquainted with Lady Henry Somerset, from <lb/>
thenceforward to be her dear friend and valued <lb/>
coadjutor.</p>
<p>Lady Henry was visiting America in her official <lb/>
capacity of President of the British Women's <lb/>
Temperance Association, and was introduced to <lb/>
Miss Willard by the well-known Quakeress preacher <lb/>
and writer, Hannah Whittall Smith.</p>
<pb n="48" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0059"/>
<p>This lady greatly desired her two much admired <lb/>
friends to be acquainted, and attempted to pave the <lb/>
way by praising each of them to the other in a generous, <lb/>
but perhaps hardly judicious fashion, for Lady <lb/>
Henry quietly remarked when Frances Willard's <lb/>
virtues and attractiveness were being thus extolled, <lb/>
that "much-praised people were usually <reg orig="disappoint-|ing">disappointing</reg>." <lb/>
However, the English lady shortly after had <lb/>
an opportunity of meeting the American in the flesh, <lb/>
and, said the Quakeress afterwards," They had not <lb/>
been together five minutes before I saw they were <lb/>
made for each other; both were delighted, and so <lb/>
was I."</p>
<p>Lady Henry Somerset has herself thus described <lb/>
that meeting:&mdash;</p>
<p>"In October, 1891, I stood for the first time on <lb/>
the platform of the railway station in the 'classic <lb/>
town' of Evanston. I had only landed in America <lb/>
a few weeks, but my steps were naturally bent to the <lb/>
Mecca of White Ribboners. &hellip; Like all Temperance <lb/>
women, good and true, I had placed Miss Willard's <lb/>
image in my inmost shrine; and yet as the train <lb/>
glided towards Evanston, I felt that our idols seem <lb/>
made to be shattered, and this one also might possibly <lb/>
shortly be dashed to the ground. On the platform <lb/>
she awaited my coming&mdash;a delicate, fragile figure, <lb/>
in a pretty blue dress, her small hand shading her <lb/>
eyes as she looked about attentively seeking her <lb/>
guest, and as she came toward me I saw a face so <lb/>
kind and frank that it seemed as though the peaceful <lb/>
simplicity of childhood had somehow remained <reg orig="un-|ruffled">unruffled</reg> <lb/>
by the chilling blasts of life. &hellip; From that <lb/>
hour I have felt that we were friends&mdash;friends not <lb/>
<pb n="49" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0060"/>
only to joy in each other's companionship, but in that <lb/>
truer sense that binds souls."</p>
<p>The following year, Miss Willard came to England <lb/>
as the guest of her new friend, and in the grounds of <lb/>
Reigate Priory, being then fifty-three years of age, <lb/>
she mastered the bicycle presented to her by Lady <lb/>
Henry, as she had been recommended physical <lb/>
exercise along with mental rest. The various stages <lb/>
of her progress towards the accomplishment of this <lb/>
by no means easy task, are described most <reg orig="enter-|tainingly">entertainingly</reg> <lb/>
and with thoughtful little moral lessons <lb/>
deduced therefrom, in Miss Willard's booklet, "A <lb/>
Wheel within a Wheel."</p>
<p>Every summer after that, until 1896, the "<reg orig="Un-|crowned">Uncrowned</reg> <lb/>
Queen" of the United States, as owing to <lb/>
her immense influence over the people of her own <lb/>
country she has been not inappropriately called, paid <lb/>
a visit to Lady Somerset's charming home. In <lb/>
January, 1893, she received a public and most <reg orig="en-|thusiastic">enthusiastic</reg> <lb/>
welcome to this country, and every year <lb/>
she became better known and more warmly loved on <lb/>
this side of the Atlantic.</p>
<p>An Englishwoman&mdash;" One who knew her," thus <lb/>
writes:&mdash;"In five minutes I was fairly conquered by <lb/>
Miss Willard's gracious, genial, simple manner. &hellip; <lb/>
At the bottom of her captivating manner lay a great <lb/>
belief in the goodness of human nature. People <lb/>
turned their best side to her, much as a flower turns <lb/>
to the sun. &hellip; Her humour constantly bubbled over. <lb/>
She looked over her gold pince-nez, a glint in her <lb/>
fine blue eyes, and uttered some quaint conceit in <lb/>
her quiet way, much amusing the company. Nor <lb/>
was she one of those who are only bright and witty <lb/>
<pb n="50" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0061"/>
in society; to get her alone was quite a treat, for she <lb/>
always gave of her best".</p>
<p>As regards the financial success of Miss Willard's <lb/>
life, concerning which some may feel curious, she has <lb/>
in her autobiography thus recorded:&mdash;" Though I <lb/>
have earned tens of thousands of dollars, I have <lb/>
nothing except Rose Cottage, the joint inheritance <lb/>
of my mother and myself, and finally to revert, after <lb/>
a tenure of 'life use,' to the National W.C.T.U.; to <lb/>
be employee by that Association for the purpose of <lb/>
training boys and girls to habits of physical purity, <lb/>
with especial reference to personal chastity and the <lb/>
non-use, in any form, of alcoholics and narcotics. &hellip; <lb/>
I believe that 'the love of money is the root of all <lb/>
evil:' that it has warped and minimised more lives, <lb/>
turned more homes into small compacts of perdition, <lb/>
and defeated the Gospel's blessed purpose more <lb/>
ingeniously than all other curses that ever crazed <lb/>
the human heart."</p>
<p>With a few more brief extracts from that volume <lb/>
to which we have already been so largely indebted, <lb/>
we must draw our memoir to a close,&mdash;extracts in <lb/>
which the clear bright mind and sweet spirit of the <lb/>
writer reflects itself.</p>
<p>"Doubtless, in early days, when the conflict was <lb/>
between idolatry and the worship of God, 'Divine <lb/>
service' may have rightly consisted largely in sermon, <lb/>
song and prayer; but to call that 'service' now, as <lb/>
is universally done, seems to me a mockery. That <lb/>
is a delight, a coveted and blessed means of growth; <lb/>
but 'service' now is to our fellow-men, and he whose <lb/>
purse and work are not invested there knows nothing <lb/>
about 'Divine service,' and might well name his place <lb/>
<pb n="51" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0062"/>
of Sunday lounging and &aelig;sthetics the 'Church of the <lb/>
Divine Emptiness,' or 'The Church of the Celestial <lb/>
Sugar Plum.'</p>
<p>"I hold that word 'anxiety' to be strongly <lb/>
atheistic, and have endeavoured to weed it out of <lb/>
my vocabulary. 'Careful for nothing, and in <hi rend="italic"><reg orig="every-|thing">everything</reg></hi> <lb/>
a giver of thanks,' is what the commonest <lb/>
sort of a Christian is sacredly bound to be, or to <lb/>
become.</p>
<p>"What the world most needs is mothering, and <lb/>
most of all in the Spirit's natural home, the Church, <lb/>
and on the Sabbath day.&hellip; The <foreign lang="spa"><hi rend="italic">sine qu&acirc; non</hi></foreign> of <lb/>
our success is mutual faith and fellowship. We must <lb/>
'have fervent charity among ourselves.' It is not <lb/>
uncharitable to judge an act as good or bad, but we <lb/>
should be very slow to judge the actor bad.</p>
<p>"'Lord Jesus, receive my spirit,' is the deepest <lb/>
voice out of my soul. Receive it every instant, <lb/>
voluntarily given back to Thyself, and receive it in <lb/>
the hour when I drop this earthly mantle that I wear <lb/>
to-day, and pass onward to the world invisible, but <lb/>
doubtless not far off."</p>
<p>Miss Willard did not come again to England after <lb/>
the autumn of 1896. Her health was failing <reg orig="con-|siderably">considerably</reg>, <lb/>
and even the months spent at a sanatorium <lb/>
in New Castile did not permanently restore her <lb/>
strength. She, however, attended the W.W.C.T.U. <lb/>
Convention at Toronto and Buffalo in 1897, declaring <lb/>
herself, in her ever brave and cheery way, to be "none <lb/>
the worse for it."</p>
<p>Towards the close of that year she went to New <lb/>
<pb n="52" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0063"/>
York for a few weeks, where the proprietor of the <lb/>
Royal Empire Hotel insisted that she should be his <lb/>
guest.</p>
<p>Here she was attacked by influenza, on which <lb/>
ensued dangerous gastric complications. There is <lb/>
no doubt that her delicate frame had been broken <lb/>
down by years of overwork, for without any warning <lb/>
the news was a few days later flashed to her friends <lb/>
all over the world that Frances Willard was dead.</p>
<p>Mrs. Willard had passed away in 1891 at the <lb/>
advanced age of eighty-seven, and this last and most <lb/>
nobly famous of her children followed her on the <lb/>
17th of February, 1898. A few months later the <lb/>
mortal remains of the "Uncrowned Queen" were <lb/>
cremated, in accordance with her repeatedly expressed <lb/>
wish, and interred in the family grave at Rose Hill <lb/>
Cemetery.</p>

and between the higher and lower nature of the <reg orig="sub-|ject">subject</reg> <lb/>
himself, ere the victory for right alone is won.</p>
<p>Naturally gentle and "biddable" children, who are <lb/>
always inclined to wait to be led, either by their elders <lb/>
or more go-ahead playmates, know nothing of this <lb/>
warfare, nor of the bitter tears which are shed by the <lb/>
vanquished or the penitent. They also have their <lb/>
place in the world&mdash;in God's great garden there is <lb/>
room for the tender creeper as well as the sturdy shrub <lb/>
&mdash;but they will never "make their mark" upon society, <lb/>
nor powerfully sway, either for good or evil, the <lb/>
generation into which they are born.</p>
<p>We are not, therefore, surprised to learn that Agnes <lb/>
Weston as a child was "for some years a source of <lb/>
great anxiety to her parents;" and that her "strong <lb/>
will and passionate temper had need of much careful <lb/>
training."</p>
<p>Happily, both for herself and the thousands to <lb/>
whom she has been made a blessing, that training was <lb/>
bestowed upon her.</p>
<p>Miss Weston's father, a barrister, and a man of <lb/>
much scientific culture, was an earnest and humble <lb/>
Christian, who delighted to use his knowledge and his <lb/>
talents to glorify God by showing the wonders of His <lb/>
infinite skill in the heavens and on earth. It is <reg orig="need-|less">needless</reg> <lb/>
to say that his daughter was the child of many <lb/>
prayers, and reared under the inestimable influences <lb/>
of noble example.</p>
<p>Mrs. Weston, who died in 1895 at the advanced <lb/>
age of eighty-four years, was always "all that was <lb/>
loving, true and good."</p>
<p>"Although," adds her daughter, "weak and <reg orig="suffer-|ing">suffering</reg> <lb/>
in health, she always so forgot her own trials that <lb/>
<pb n="57" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0068"/>
she made home the brightest, happiest place in the <lb/>
world for her children. She won their confidence and <lb/>
love, and kept it to her latest breath. Singularly gifted, <lb/>
and endowed with a sweet personal presence, she used <lb/>
all in her Master's service."</p>
<p>Quite late in life, when many would have excused <lb/>
themselves from self-denial on account of the <reg orig="infir-|mities">infirmities</reg> <lb/>
of old age, Mrs. Weston, under the influence <lb/>
of an address by Canon Basil Wilberforce, signed the <lb/>
total abstinence pledge, which she kept unbroken until <lb/>
the day of her death, nearly twenty years afterwards.</p>
<p>No wonder that Miss Weston herself should exclaim, <lb/>
"Woe to me, if with such a father and mother, and <lb/>
with such home influences, I had been aught but a <lb/>
child of God and a worker in His vineyard! "</p>
<p>Training, however, does but guide; it cannot alter, <lb/>
much less create, the natural bent of temperament and <lb/>
disposition. Agnes Weston's vigour and energy, her <lb/>
love of fighting opposition and surmounting difficulties, <lb/>
were her birthright.</p>
<p>A friend of her father, a phrenologist, on examining <lb/>
the exterior signs of the child's cerebral development, <lb/>
prophesied that her career would be a remarkable one. <lb/>
He further expressed his conviction that a crisis would <lb/>
some day occur in her life, when she would "turn <lb/>
decisively either to the right or left, would choose to <lb/>
be great either in the service of God or that of the <lb/>
world."</p>
<p>Those who believe that mental superiority is an <lb/>
evidence of "good blood" and noble origin, will be <lb/>
interested to learn that the ancestors of the subject of <lb/>
this sketch were actually among the aristocratic <lb/>
Normans who "came over with William the <reg orig="Con-|queror">Conqueror</reg>;" <lb/>
<pb n="58" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0069"/>
the first of the name of whom record exists <lb/>
being Raoul de Bailleul de Weston, the English-<reg orig="sound-|ing">sounding</reg> <lb/>
suffix relating, we presume, to the lands and manors <lb/>
wherewith the great Norman rewarded his loyal <lb/>
follower. In any case, it is worth noting that the <lb/>
family seems to have been distinguished by remarkable <lb/>
force of character from that remote time until the <lb/>
present.</p>
<p>Agnes Weston did nothing by halves. She was <lb/>
always "out and out" either for good or bad.</p>
<p>Up to the age of sixteen, though brought up amid <lb/>
such eminently Christian surroundings, she was not <lb/>
merely formal and lifeless in the performance of <lb/>
religious duties, she absolutely ignored the commonest <lb/>
means of grace&mdash;save that of attendance at Divine <lb/>
worship, which was doubtless more or less <reg orig="compul-|sory,&mdash;but">compulsory,&mdash;but</reg> <lb/>
Bible-reading and private prayer were <lb/>
utterly neglected. Not only passively, like so many <lb/>
people, but actively irreligious did this young girl <lb/>
appear.</p>
<p>It was by the ministry of the Rev. James, now <lb/>
Canon, Fleming, that Agnes Weston's conscience first <lb/>
became awakened. He was appointed to the <reg orig="incum-|bency">incumbency</reg> <lb/>
of All Saints' Chapel, Bath, to which town the <lb/>
Westons, while Agnes was yet an infant, had from <lb/>
London removed.</p>
<p>Strange that the instinct of combativeness, which <lb/>
phrenologists tell us is the source of most of the <lb/>
active good that is accomplished in the world, should <lb/>
in its crude condition have at once impelled Miss <lb/>
Weston to violently oppose the working of God's <lb/>
Holy Spirit! Startling, indeed, is it to read from her <lb/>
own pen such a confession as this: &mdash;</p>
<pb n="59" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0070"/>
<p>"I was obliged to go to church, but I was <reg orig="deter-|mined">determined</reg> <lb/>
not to listen, and oftentimes when the preacher <lb/>
gave out the text, I have stopped my ears, and shut <lb/>
my eyes that I might neither see nor hear."</p>
<p>But the Heavenly Father would not give up His <lb/>
child, the Shepherd would not cease to follow and <lb/>
patiently call to the lamb that was lost.</p>
<p>The loving parents kept on praying, Mr. Fleming, <lb/>
little guessing how strong, yet rebellious a soul was <lb/>
struggling against his home-thrusts, continued to <lb/>
preach God's truth, a good Christian friend helped <lb/>
in the work, and presently the armour of obstinate <lb/>
repugnance began to yield.</p>
<p>Agnes was persuaded to read the Bible for herself <lb/>
and to think about it.</p>
<p>For hours, then, we are told, she used to wander <lb/>
about the fields, Bible in hand, and many a night she <lb/>
was sleepless from agony of soul.</p>
<p>It really seems as though Satan, foreseeing the <lb/>
incalculable injury to his work that would ensue if <lb/>
once he let this vigorous character, this large heart and <lb/>
busy mind, escape into the ranks of the Saviour's <lb/>
host, put forth all his efforts to entangle and <reg orig="dis-|courage">discourage</reg> <lb/>
her, raging to hold her back.</p>
<p>He bewildered her with doubts, he tortured her <lb/>
with the paralysing suggestions of scepticism, he <lb/>
terrified her by pointing to a broken law. He used <lb/>
every art "acquired," as we once heard a preacher <lb/>
remark, "in his 6000 years of experience" in deceiving <lb/>
humanity, to baffle her in her search for light and <lb/>
peace. She was worth fighting for!</p>
<p>But the Victor over all was too strong for him; <lb/>
Agnes had at last yielded herself to the guidance of <lb/>
<pb n="60" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0071"/>
the Holy Spirit, so soon or late, all must be well with <lb/>
her. Yet the conflict was drear and long.</p>
<p>It was during this time of inward unrest that she <lb/>
commenced, with her usual irresistible energy, the <lb/>
mastery of the organ, preferring, characteristically, that <lb/>
instrument to any other, because of the difficulty of <lb/>
manipulating it.</p>
<p>For some time she studied under the late J. R. Pyne, <lb/>
Esq., organist of the Abbey Church, Bath; wrestling <lb/>
with technicalities and practising with a perseverance <lb/>
that was only checked by the endurance of the <reg orig="organ-|blower">organ-blower</reg>, <lb/>
whose strength was often unequal to the <lb/>
industry of the student.</p>
<p>At the recommendation of Mr. Pyne, who thought <lb/>
highly of his pupil's ability, Miss Weston was enabled <lb/>
to place herself after a while under the tuition of that <lb/>
celebrated organist and composer, Dr. S. S. Wesley, <lb/>
of Gloucester Cathedral; and for a time she might be <lb/>
found every day, and nearly all day, seated at the <lb/>
cathedral organ, preparing herself unconsciously for <lb/>
the work in after life which was being prepared for her.</p>
<p>It is to this period that an incident pertains which <lb/>
well illustrates Miss Weston's courage and resolution.</p>
<p>Dr. Wesley was one evening giving her a lesson in <lb/>
the cathedral after dark; no lights were allowed <lb/>
except in the organ-loft, the remainder of the vast, <lb/>
echoing building being engulfed in darkness.</p>
<p>Dr. Wesley was summoned away in haste by a <lb/>
messenger from home soon after the lesson began, but <lb/>
he promised to speedily return. He was compelled, <lb/>
however, to lock the young lady alone in the cathedral <lb/>
during his absence, as it was against rule to leave the <lb/>
doors open. But to this she did not in the least object.</p>
<pb n="61" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0072"/>
<p>Dr. Wesley had not been gone long, before even <lb/>
Miss Weston's absorption in her occupation was <reg orig="dis-|turbed">disturbed</reg> <lb/>
by the sound, real or imagined, of footsteps on <lb/>
the stones of the aisle below. Slowly but surely they <lb/>
drew nearer, and to the performer's horror, paused in <lb/>
the side chapel at the foot of the organ loft! She <lb/>
knew it was not her tutor's familiar tread, and the <lb/>
stories of the ghost of a certain Crusader, by which <lb/>
the dim, mysterious pile was said to be haunted, came <lb/>
rushing into her mind.</p>
<p>But Agnes Weston was not one to sit still and <lb/>
tremble; she must up and <hi rend="italic">do!</hi> She sprang to <lb/>
her feet, threw aside the curtain and saw&mdash;nothing!</p>
<p>The strange sounds, she concluded, were occasioned <lb/>
probably by the wind sobbing around the pillars and <lb/>
tombs in the cloisters and aisle; and reassured she <lb/>
went quietly on with her practising until Dr. Wesley <lb/>
appeared.</p>
<p>True foreshadowing of the pluck and determination <lb/>
with which in after years she would face obstacles, both <lb/>
tangible and visionary, and by which many a dark <lb/>
spectre of ignorance, godlessness and intemperance <lb/>
should be put to the rout.</p>

TEMPERANCE AND THE BLUE-JACKETS.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">It</hi> was not until after nearly ten years of struggle <lb/>
and strife that Agnes Weston found her "desired <lb/>
haven" of rest and peace in Jesus Christ.</p>
<pb n="62" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0073"/>
<p>The hushing of the storm was so gradual, the return <lb/>
of the tempest for a long time so recurrent, that the <lb/>
exact date when calm commenced its final reign <lb/>
cannot be definitely given; but by the year 1868 we <lb/>
find Miss Weston actively and happily engaged in <lb/>
various forms of Christian work, teaching the young, <lb/>
visiting the sick, and ministering to the dying.</p>
<p>We are quite prepared to hear that in the Sunday <lb/>
school her force of character and love of difficulty <lb/>
brought every unruly class in turn beneath her firm <lb/>
but kindly hand, and that "the more unmanageable <lb/>
they were, the more she delighted in, as the curate <lb/>
expressed it, 'licking them into shape.'"</p>
<p>Of course, she loved big boys! The future <lb/>
"mother" of Jack Tar could not do otherwise. And <lb/>
by degrees her class of senior lads developed into a <lb/>
class for working-men, and this in turn was the <lb/>
nucleus of her mission work at Walcot, near Bath, <lb/>
where Working-Men's Bible-Classes and <reg orig="Prayer-|meetings">Prayer-meetings</reg>, <lb/>
Temperance and Band of Hope efforts <lb/>
were crowned with much blessing.</p>
<p>For Miss Weston was a staunch advocate of <lb/>
Temperance even before she had herself signed the <lb/>
pledge. The story of how it came about that she <lb/>
was induced to make that decisive stand has often <lb/>
been related, but it is so good, and carries so striking <lb/>
a lesson to other Christian workers, as to be worth <lb/>
telling again.</p>
<p>At the close of one of her Temperance meetings, <lb/>
a notorious drunkard came up to the table and wished <lb/>
to sign the pledge.</p>
<p>Miss Weston was delighted, but her triumph was <lb/>
soon checked, for as the man held the pen in his <lb/>
<pb n="63" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0074"/>
hand, before he began to write, he suddenly looked <lb/>
up at her and asked:&mdash;</p>
<p>"If you please, Miss Weston, be <hi rend="italic">you</hi> a teetotaller?"</p>
<p>Somewhat taken aback by this unexpected query, <lb/>
Miss Weston replied, "I only take a glass of wine <lb/>
occasionally, and in strict moderation."</p>
<p>The man at once laid down the pen, saying that <lb/>
he would do the same, and take a glass sometimes <lb/>
"in moderation."</p>
<p>Needless to say, this was to him impossible, and <lb/>
he soon plunged back into his old ways.</p>
<p>"That night," adds Miss Weston, "I saw my duty <lb/>
very plainly, and I enrolled my name in the <reg orig="pledge-|book">pledge-book</reg>, <lb/>
heartily wishing that I had done so before."</p>
<p>The assembling of the Somerset Militia every year <lb/>
at Bath, for training, was the cause of Miss Weston <lb/>
becoming interested in soldiers,&mdash;for the time of the <lb/>
sailors, though approaching, had not yet fully come.</p>
<p>When coffee and reading-rooms were started for <lb/>
the benefit of the men, she naturally took great <lb/>
interest in them, and frequently assisted at the <lb/>
meetings which were arranged for recreation. She <lb/>
also undertook a Sunday Bible-class, and the result <lb/>
of her efforts became so apparent in the improved <lb/>
behaviour of the men, that as one officer testified, <lb/>
they were "not like the same fellows."</p>
<p>From Tommy Atkins it is but a step to his <lb/>
brother, Jack Tar, and this is how, in Miss Weston's <lb/>
case, that step was taken.</p>
<p>In that same eventful year, 1868, she wrote a <lb/>
friendly letter to a soldier of her acquaintance who <lb/>
was on his way to India. The man, proud and <lb/>
pleased, showed the letter to one of the seamen, <lb/>
<pb n="64" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0075"/>
a sick-berth steward, evoking the longing comment, <lb/>
"I would give anything if I could get a letter like <lb/>
that sometimes! Do you think that lady would <lb/>
write to me?"</p>
<p>"I am sure she would. I will write and ask her," <lb/>
replied the other.</p>
<p>He did so. Miss Weston gladly answered it, <lb/>
complying with his request. And that letter to one <lb/>
friendless seaman, yearning for sympathy, on board <lb/>
the <hi rend="italic">Crocodile</hi>, was the germ of her present stupendous <lb/>
and world-wide labour among sailors.</p>
<p>For the next thing was that the grateful fellow <lb/>
wrote to her himself, enclosing the names of several <lb/>
other sailors who would be as thankful for a letter <lb/>
as he was. She penned kindly, encouraging epistles <lb/>
to them all, and week by week her correspondence <lb/>
steadily increased.</p>
<p>At last the requests for these much-prized letters <lb/>
became so numerous that it was impossible to keep <lb/>
pace with them except by the regular supplementary <lb/>
issue of a printed one. Thus Miss Weston's <reg orig="in-|valuable">invaluable</reg> <lb/>
"Monthly Letter" to Seamen, Marines, and <lb/>
Marine Artillery was started, and it proved from the <lb/>
outset an immense success. From a circulation of <lb/>
1500 copies per month in 1872, it rose to its present <lb/>
astounding figure of 21,000! And in addition, Miss <lb/>
Weston and her three Secretaries write to thousands <lb/>
of men individually.</p>
<p>The pleasure which these "Letters" give to lonely <lb/>
sailors all over the world, their significance to those <lb/>
ofttimes monotonous and isolated lives, and the <lb/>
spiritual blessing which in innumerable cases has <lb/>
followed their perusal, it is impossible to estimate.</p>
<pb n="65" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0076"/>
<p>The issue of a letter specially addressed to boys <lb/>
soon became necessary, for they too clamoured <lb/>
for a share in the treat. This was commenced in 1874, <lb/>
and the circulation soon reached many thousands <lb/>
per month</p>
<p>Miss Weston's warm heart had not long been <lb/>
opened to receive Jack Tar, before she became deeply <lb/>
impressed with the fact that his worst foe is drink.</p>
<p>Having herself, ever since that memorable night <lb/>
at the Walcot Mission Room, been an out-and-out <lb/>
total abstainer, she was anxious to bring the power of <lb/>
her persuasions to bear upon the sailor.</p>
<p>This was by no means, at first, so easy as might be <lb/>
supposed, the discipline and rules of the Service being <lb/>
somewhat inflexible. But Admiral Sir W. King Hall, <lb/>
K.C.B., proved her earliest and most influential friend. <lb/>
He had heard her give a short address to the <lb/>
Devonport dockyard men in their dinner hour, and <lb/>
willingly recommended her to the captains of all the <lb/>
ships in the harbour. One after another of them she <lb/>
was thus permitted to visit, pledge-book in hand, and <lb/>
her earnest, affectionate words were not without effect <lb/>
upon the men.</p>
<p>A very amusing episode is related in connection <lb/>
with this phase of Miss Weston's work. We will <lb/>
describe it in her own graphic words:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I found myself one day on board H.M.S. <hi rend="italic">Topaze</hi>, <lb/>
of course by the kind permission of the commander. <lb/>
He was most interested in the proceedings, and was <lb/>
present himself; the crowd of blue-jackets were <lb/>
grouped before me on the lower deck. After <reg orig="address-|ing">addressing</reg> <lb/>
them, anxious not to lose an opportunity of taking <lb/>
the names of those who wished to enrol themselves on <lb/>
<pb n="66" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0077"/>
the <hi rend="italic">Topaze's</hi> books, I asked permission to do so, which <lb/>
was freely granted; but the difficulty still to be solved <lb/>
was the want of a table. I looked around, and seeing, <lb/>
as I supposed, a bread-tub with its bright polished <lb/>
bands standing near, I asked if I might be allowed to <lb/>
use it as a table.</p>
<p>"' Certainly,' was the answer, with a smile; 'but it's <lb/>
the first time it has been put to such a use. Now, <lb/>
men, a couple of hands to roll out the <hi rend="italic">grog-tub!'</hi></p>
<p>"Amid cheers and laughter the grog-tub was rolled <lb/>
out, and a capital table it made, on which more than <lb/>
sixty enrolled their names. One young sailor came <lb/>
forward and signed his name; after doing so he laid <lb/>
down the pen, and, significantly rapping the tub with <lb/>
his knuckles, said, 'There goes a nail in your coffin, <lb/>
old fellow!'</p>
<p>"After all that wished to do so had entered their <lb/>
names, the commander took up the book, and running <lb/>
his eye down the lists, significantly added, 'Sixty odd <lb/>
nails to-day; if they all hold firm I won't give much <lb/>
for the old grog-tub's life.'"</p>
<p>Years have passed by since that first nail was <lb/>
driven home, and if the grog-tub has not yet been <lb/>
tossed overboard altogether, its power over the fine <lb/>
fellows in our Navy has lessened to an astonishing <lb/>
degree. Every ship in the Service has now a branch <lb/>
of the <hi rend="italic">Royal Naval Temperance Society</hi> in full swing <lb/>
on board. During a recent year 6021 pledges were <lb/>
taken at Devonport and Portsmouth alone.</p>
<p>As an encouragement to faithfulness, medals are <lb/>
offered to those who keep the pledge unbroken for five <lb/>
years, with "bars" for ten, fifteen and twenty years <lb/>
abstinence. Stars of merit are also given to the <reg orig="Com-|mittee">Committee</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="67" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0078"/>
of any ship showing ten per cent. Of the ship's <lb/>
company on the books of the society for three months. <lb/>
Upwards of 1500 of these medals and stars have <lb/>
already been won.</p>
<p>Voluntary tributes to the vastly improved character <lb/>
of our blue-jackets are often given by officers and <lb/>
others who are in a position to compare the present <lb/>
with the past.</p>
<p>A gentleman who chanced to be in Lisbon during <lb/>
a recent visit of H.M.S. <hi rend="italic">Australia</hi>, and whose duties <lb/>
as a civilian have afforded him opportunities of <reg orig="wit-|nessing">witnessing</reg> <lb/>
the behaviour for twenty years past of British <lb/>
crews in many parts of the world, has testified that, <lb/>
"I must say I never saw a crew behave as well as the <lb/>
men of the <hi rend="italic">Australia</hi>. They were perfect gentlemen, <lb/>
and were a credit to their officers and their country."</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>' correspondent at Lisbon also wrote of <lb/>
the "quiet, dignified behaviour" of the men while on <lb/>
shore as exciting "universal admiration."</p>
<p>No wonder that Miss Weston and her zealous <lb/>
helpers feel their hearts glow with gratitude to God <lb/>
and pride in their men, as they read such eulogies as <lb/>
these! It is abundantly evident that their work has <lb/>
not been in vain.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">In</hi> the pleasant town of Devonport, exactly opposite <lb/>
the gates of the Royal Dockyard, stands a <reg orig="hand-|some">handsome</reg> <lb/>
pile of buildings, known as the Royal Sailors' <lb/>
<pb n="68" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0079"/>
Rest. It occupies the site formerly filled by three <lb/>
public-houses.</p>
<p>The exterior of this Jack Tar's hotel is most <reg orig="entic-|ing">enticing</reg>; <lb/>
plenty of glittering mirrors, gas and gilding, <lb/>
while the white and gold china barrels with silver taps <lb/>
bearing the inscriptions, "New Milk," "Lemonade," <lb/>
"Ginger-Beer," etc., vie with the shining coffee urns <lb/>
in aspiring to quench the thirst of Jack when <lb/>
ashore.</p>
<p>Plenty of good food, hot, sweet, and above all in big <lb/>
platefuls, is also to be had at a reasonable price, while <lb/>
a large smoking-room adjoins.</p>
<p>Upstairs is a comfortably furnished reading and <lb/>
writing-room; cosy bedrooms for officers, and <reg orig="charm-|ing">charming</reg> <lb/>
wee cabins for the men, each furnished with a <lb/>
spotless bed, clean and comfortable&mdash;a great luxury <lb/>
to a man, after perhaps, days and nights spent in wind <lb/>
and wet&mdash;a chair, a strip of carpet, and some bright <lb/>
pictures and texts. These private cabins are much <lb/>
prized, especially by the Christian men, as they have <lb/>
no quiet place which they can call their own on board <lb/>
ship.</p>
<p>At right angles with the Institute, and in the <lb/>
rear, is the Hall, where meetings are held every day, <lb/>
for amusement and recreation during the week, and <lb/>
for the preaching and singing of the Gospel on <lb/>
Sundays.</p>
<p>In Commercial Road, Portsmouth, another of these <lb/>
magnificent Blue Jackets' Coffee Palaces supplies <lb/>
good food and drink by day, and comfortable beds by <lb/>
night to hundreds of men and boys.</p>
<p>And don't they appreciate it all!</p>
<p>"Your Sailors' Rest," said the captain of a <reg orig="training-|ship">training-ship</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="69" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0080"/>
to Miss Weston one day, "is like a magnet. No <lb/>
matter where the boys land they make for it."</p>
<p>One boy said to a chum, "I wish, Jack, that you'd <lb/>
come to the Boys' Bible-Class at the Sailors' Rest; <lb/>
I'm sure you'll like it. I'll stand you a fid of plum <lb/>
duff if you 'll come."</p>
<p>The "fid"&mdash;<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> piece, of plum-pudding prevailed. <lb/>
The boy went, and stayed, and went again. In after <lb/>
years he said, "How can I thank my chum enough? <lb/>
For that piece of duff led me to a place where I <lb/>
learned that Christ loved me, and now I love Him."</p>
<p>But before we relate any more good results of these <lb/>
Sailors' Rests, we must pause to tell how they first <lb/>
came about.</p>
<p>It began with the boys from the training-ships <lb/>
stationed at Devonport. Miss Weston, while staying <lb/>
with a friend in the neighbourhood, became interested <lb/>
in the immense number of sailor lads who might be <lb/>
seen wandering aimlessly about the streets on Sunday <lb/>
afternoons, forming bad habits and mixing with <lb/>
dangerous company.</p>
<p>Although by no means encouraged by the officers <lb/>
whom she consulted on the subject, and who thought <lb/>
that the natural restlessness of the sailor boys on <lb/>
shore would prevent success in any attempt to gather <lb/>
them together, Miss Weston had notices distributed <lb/>
among the lads on board ship, inviting them to meet <lb/>
her at a large public room in Devonport, for singing <lb/>
and reading on Sunday afternoons.</p>
<p>On the first Sunday, <hi rend="italic">one</hi> boy appeared, out of the <lb/>
hundreds who were roaming the streets, and he was <lb/>
too much frightened at his solitary position to be <reg orig="in-|duced">induced</reg> <lb/>
to stay.</p>
<pb n="70" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0081"/>
<p>Four Sundays more passed as discouragingly by, <lb/>
and then even Miss Weston felt inclined to give up. <lb/>
But first she asked help and wisdom of the Lord in <lb/>
prayer.</p>
<p>One of the officers alluded to, had compared the <lb/>
boys to "birds let out of a cage;"&mdash;as shy did they <lb/>
seem, as difficult to catch and hold. But like birds <lb/>
they were to be tempted and tamed with crumbs.</p>
<p>The crumb in this case was the offer of tea and <lb/>
cake in the roomy kitchen belonging to Miss <lb/>
Weston's friend, Mrs. Wintz, and two earnest Christian <lb/>
men volunteered to go out into the streets and try to <lb/>
gather the boys in.</p>
<p>This time the effort was more successful; a dozen <lb/>
lads were collected, regaled with a substantial meal, <lb/>
and entertained by the singing of sacred songs and <lb/>
the telling of some simple Bible story.</p>
<p>These soon brought a dozen more, and in a very <lb/>
few weeks the ever-increasing numbers were filling <lb/>
Mrs. Wintz's cheery kitchen to overflowing. They <lb/>
would sit we are told, "on the window-ledge, among <lb/>
the cups and saucers on the dresser, and even inside <lb/>
the grate"!</p>
<p>Some of those lads, Miss Weston was rejoiced to <lb/>
find, were already Christians, leading bright, <reg orig="con-|sistent">consistent</reg> <lb/>
lives among their mates, and these were her <lb/>
staunch allies in bringing others to the meetings.</p>
<p>By-and-by, when the kitchen could no longer <lb/>
possibly contain all who came, a large room was <lb/>
hired, close to one of the landing-places, and this in <lb/>
its turn was filled with boys every Sunday <reg orig="after-|noon">afternoon</reg>.</p>
<p>Then some began to ask if they could not have a <lb/>

place to come to on week-days as well,&mdash;"a <reg orig="public-|house">public-house</reg> <lb/>
without the drink."</p>
<p>Many difficulties were again to be surmounted <lb/>
before this desire could be attained; but with the help <lb/>
from above given in answer to many earnest prayers, <lb/>
they one by one gave way.</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1874 a big house became vacant <lb/>
in Fore Street, the main thoroughfare of Devonport. <lb/>
It was exactly the sort of place Miss Weston wanted, <lb/>
roomy and substantial, but needing many alterations <lb/>
before it would be ready for her purpose.</p>
<p>With the help of her ever faithful friend and <reg orig="fellow-|labourer">fellow-labourer</reg>, <lb/>
Miss Wintz, Miss Weston at once <reg orig="com-|menced">commenced</reg> <lb/>
collecting money for the work, and with <lb/>
marked success. A letter to the <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> resulted <lb/>
in a few days in sufficient to pay the whole of the first <lb/>
year's rent; friends of the sailor from all parts of the <lb/>
world willingly helped, and Jack himself was only too <lb/>
pleased to send his savings to swell the purse; until <lb/>
the &pound;6000 was collected which bought and fitted up <lb/>
the Devonport Sailors' Rest.</p>
<p>The work of alteration and improvement necessarily <lb/>
occupied some time, and it was not until the 8th of <lb/>
May, 1876, that, at five o'clock on a sunny morning, the <lb/>
doors were actually opened for business, and customers <lb/>
at once began to pour in. But from that hour to the <lb/>
present the popularity and usefulness of the place has <lb/>
never flagged.</p>
<p>Connected with the Institute, as we have said, is a <lb/>
hall, where Gospel services are held, and every kind <lb/>
of effort made for the good of Jack's soul as earnestly <lb/>
as in the adjoining building the comfort and welfare <lb/>
of his body are considered.</p>
<pb n="74" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0085"/>
<p>The following incident, culled, as are many others <lb/>
in this sketch, from Miss Wintz's interesting book, <lb/>
"Our Blue-Jackets," is well worth quoting as a <lb/>
specimen of the sort of influence which the Sailors' <lb/>
Rest exercises over the tar.</p>
<p>A sailor, half-sober, sauntered one evening into <lb/>
the bright bar. Throwing down half-a-crown on the <lb/>
counter, he called out to one of the servers to give <lb/>
him a glass of half-and-half, "and mind you make it <lb/>
stiff," he added. Instead of looking grimly at him <lb/>
and reproving him, she at once said, with a woman's <lb/>
tact&mdash;</p>
<p>"We haven't your sort of half-and-half, but would <lb/>
you like to try some of ours?"</p>
<p>"Yours!" was his response. "What's that, then?"</p>
<p>"Well," she said, "will you have something hot or <lb/>
cold?"</p>
<p>He smiled. "You seem to have more than cold <lb/>
water; I'd like a jorum of something hot".</p>
<p>"Well, would you like a cup of coffee?"</p>
<p>"Yes, that I would," he answered; "it's a long <lb/>
time since I've had much in the coffee line."</p>
<p>Looking at him again, and thinking that she would <lb/>
bait the hook still more, she said, "Are you a <reg orig="Devon-|shire">Devonshire</reg> <lb/>
man?"</p>
<p>"To be sure I am&mdash;a West countryman to the <lb/>
backbone," was the prompt answer.</p>
<p>"Then," she said, "you'll like a little Devonshire <lb/>
cream in your coffee."</p>
<p>This carried the day; Jack's eyes fairly danced in <lb/>
his head, as he said, "I've been round the Horn, and <lb/>
I don't know where beside, but it's a long day since <lb/>
I and Devonshire cream have met. Thank ye, <lb/>

missus, kindly," and he sat down to enjoy the first <lb/>
cup of coffee he had tasted for many a day.</p>
<p>The story goes on to relate that when only a penny <lb/>
was charged him for the treat, his amazement knew <lb/>
no bounds, and he went away to tell his mates about <lb/>
the new-fangled public-house which he had found. <lb/>
Better still, it was the beginning of a new life to <lb/>
him. He became a Temperance man and a zealous <lb/>
Christian.</p>
<p>"And all along," as he said, "under God, of that <lb/>
kind word and cup of coffee."</p>
<p>Jack is certainly most appreciative of good things <lb/>
of every sort. From Saturday to Monday, at <reg orig="Devon-|port">Devonport</reg> <lb/>
alone, he consumed: one whole pig, to say <lb/>
nothing of beef and mutton, 1200 eggs, 150 dozen <lb/>
rolls, 1100 sausages, 9 hams, and 30 gallons of tea <lb/>
and coffee, while over &pound;100 was taken across the <lb/>
counter in small sums.</p>
<p>And at the Rest in Commercial Road. Portsmouth, <lb/>
opened in June, 1882, precisely the same sort of <lb/>
thing is continually going on.</p>
<p>Drunk or sober, Jack is always welcome. When <lb/>
the beds are all full, "shake-downs" are hastily <lb/>
prepared; when these are every one occupied, the <lb/>
lounges of the reading and recreation rooms, the <lb/>
reading-room table, which is declared "ample <reg orig="ac-|commodation">accommodation</reg> <lb/>
for nine," and all the smaller tables <lb/>
are pressed into the service. Far into the small hours <lb/>
of the morning the police keep bringing in poor, <lb/>
helpless fellows, too much the worse for drink to be <lb/>
able to take care of themselves. When the <reg orig="public-|house">public-house</reg> <lb/>
turns them out, the Rest takes them in, and not <lb/>
unfrequently their gratitude is so great that they <lb/>
<pb n="78" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0089"/>
are willing to abjure the public-house for ever <lb/>
more.</p>
<p>It is between 11 and 11.30 P.M. when ships are in <lb/>
<figure id="f17" rend="block" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0089">
<head>THE REFRESHMENT BAR.</head>

port that the most business is done. Were we to <lb/>
look in at either of the Sailors' Rests about that time, <lb/>
we should see, "Here a man turning out his pockets, <lb/>
<pb n="79" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0090"/>
and giving his loose cash, watch, etc., to the manager, <lb/>
to keep till morning, receiving a receipt in return; <lb/>
there, a party just come in are discussing coffee and <lb/>
pasties, a noisy seaman is being coaxed and persuaded <lb/>
to go to bed, while a lively set of young fellows call <lb/>
out, 'Last boats just off! Good-night all!' as they <lb/>
disappear to their rooms."</p>
<p>A nickname in the Navy generally means popularity. <lb/>
None could be more apt than that bestowed on the <lb/>
Rest by the sailors themselves. They call it the <lb/>
"Three C.'s." As one of them explained, "It means <lb/>
Coffee, Comfort and Company; and if a man's got <lb/>
good coffee, comfort, and plenty of good company. <lb/>
it goes a long way to keep him from what's wrong."</p>
<p>Bright evangelistic meetings, lasting not more than <lb/>
one hour, are constantly arranged for in connection <lb/>
with all the social efforts, and bright temperance <lb/>
entertainments are supplied to tempt Jack out of <lb/>
harm's way.</p>
<p>Many are the touching testimonies received of the <lb/>
blessing gained at these religious gatherings; sailors <lb/>
write from all parts of the world telling that a <lb/>
sentence in some Gospel address, or the words of <lb/>
some beautiful hymn sung by the choir have been <lb/>
the means of leading them to Christ.</p>
<p>Warm expressions of approval have been from time <lb/>
to time vouchsafed to Miss Weston by Royalty.</p>
<p>H.R.H. the Prince of Wales as well as both the <lb/>
Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh have visited the <lb/>
Sailors' Rest at Devonport. The Prince of Wales <lb/>
expressed himself delighted with all that he saw, and <lb/>
specially admired the cabins.</p>
<p>In the course of a few years, as a natural result of <lb/>
<pb n="80" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0091"/>
success, more space became the imperative demand. <lb/>
At first, so fully occupied was every foot of land in <lb/>
the neighbourhood, that larger premises seemed <reg orig="im-|possible">impossible</reg>, <lb/>
but before long, again as the reward of <lb/>
prayer and perseverance, three of the worst <reg orig="public-|houses">public-houses</reg> <lb/>
in Devonport, standing in a row close to the <lb/>
Dock gates, and depreciated in value, doubtless, by <lb/>
their flourishing Temperance rival, were bought, <lb/>
licences and all, for &pound;7000, and the present handsome <lb/>
Royal Sailors' Rest erected on their site.</p>
<p>During Jubilee year an interesting visit was paid <lb/>
to the Portsmouth Rest by H.R.H. the Crown <lb/>
Princess of Germany, now the Empress Frederick. <lb/>
H.R.H. accompanied by Princess Victoria of Prussia <lb/>
and others of her suite, went all over the building; <lb/>
she chatted to the blue-jackets in the reading-room, <lb/>
and delighted them by drinking a cup of coffee, which <lb/>
she pronounced excellent.</p>
<p>"After thoroughly inspecting the building, H.R.H. <lb/>
expressed to Miss Weston her great pleasure in all <lb/>
that she had seen, and said that she wished to endow <lb/>
a cabin because her second son was a sailor. This <lb/>
cabin can be seen at Portsmouth, a portrait of Prince <lb/>
Henry of Prussia, kindly sent by the Emperor from <lb/>
Kiel, hanging in it."</p>
<p>Captain H.R.H. the Duke of York has also most <lb/>
generously presented a cabin and consented to become <lb/>
president of the institution.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">But</hi> it is not always a happy home-coming that <lb/>
awaits the blue-jacket when his voyage is <lb/>
done. His life is not wholly made up of delightful <lb/>

and feasts of "cakes and ale"&mdash;we beg Miss Weston's <lb/>

<p>Though not exposed to so many perils of the deep <lb/>
as our fishing-fleets and smaller merchantmen. Her <lb/>
Majesty's magnificent ships do not enjoy absolute <reg orig="im-|munity">immunity</reg> <lb/>
from danger, even in times peace. And <lb/>
when disasters do occur, they are usually of the most <lb/>
unlooked-for and overwhelming character.</p>
<p>Witness the loss of the <hi rend="italic">Serpent</hi> in November, <lb/>
1890, when, in the darkness of the dead of night, the <lb/>
immense iron-clad struck upon a reef, and in a few <lb/>

only were subsequently saved.</p>
<p>Or, again, remember the strange accident that <lb/>
occurred off the coast of Syria, in June, 1893, when <lb/>
owing to some extraordinary misunderstanding, the <lb/>
ram of the <hi rend="italic">Camperdown</hi> was driven through her <reg orig="sister-|ship">sister-ship</reg>, <lb/>
the ill-fated <hi rend="italic">Victoria,</hi> cutting her nearly in two.</p>
<p>And more recently still have we heard of the sad <lb/>
loss of two smaller boats, the pinnace of H.M.S. <hi rend="italic">Edgar</hi> <lb/>
in the Corea, and the whaler of H.M.S. <hi rend="italic">Acorn</hi> on <lb/>
another station.</p>
<pb n="82" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0093"/>
<p>Sympathetic hearts all over England are moved <lb/>
with sorrow when such news arrives, and many will <lb/>
ache for the poor widows and children of the drowned <lb/>
men. But it is to Miss Weston and her helpers that <lb/>
the grief comes most keenly home; none can realise <lb/>
it as they do.</p>
<p>The wives and mothers who so smilingly crowded <lb/>
the bar of the Sailors' Rest when Jack was last at <lb/>
home, or sat, with baby on knee, at one or other of the <lb/>
pleasant social gatherings to which they are welcome, <lb/>
now rush broken-hearted to the Admiral's office to <lb/>
learn more of the dreadful truth.</p>
<p>At the best of times, they live within measurable <lb/>
distance of destitution. Few sailors are able to send <lb/>
their wives more than ten shillings a-week, and when <lb/>
this is suddenly cut off, starvation stares the poor <lb/>
widow and little ones in the face.</p>
<p>Miss Weston and Miss Wintz have long been sorely <lb/>
exercised in mind as to how best to help Jack's wife. <lb/>
Sailors' Wives' Meetings, Drapery Clubs, etc, have <lb/>
been started for her benefit; and a Work Department <lb/>
has been organised in connection with the Royal <lb/>
Sailors' Rest at Portsmouth, where a skilled cutter-out <lb/>
prepares work for nimble and industrious fingers, and <lb/>
whence issue numbers of beautifully made garments&mdash; <lb/>
ladies' and children's underclothing, and little one's <lb/>
dresses&mdash;for purchase by any who wish to help forward <lb/>
the good work.</p>
<p>But although the sailor's wife can in this way eke <lb/>
out her weekly pay, it is hard for her, when she is <lb/>
bereft of her husband, to wholly support, by her <lb/>
needle, herself and children.</p>
<p>Grand as have been the sums of money collected by <lb/>
<pb n="83" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0094"/>
the public on the occasion of each of the great naval <lb/>
disasters we have mentioned, and untold the relief and <lb/>
comfort administered by such means to the bereaved, <lb/>
it could not be enough. Miss Weston has long felt <lb/>
that something permanent ought to be arranged by <lb/>
Government for the assistance of the widows and <lb/>
orphans of the brave men who lose their lives in their <lb/>
country's service.</p>
<p>Several funds for this purpose already existed, but <lb/>
their administration appears to have been somewhat <lb/>
defective; for, as examples, Miss Weston was able, <lb/>
when the subject was under Government consideration, <lb/>
to bring to the House of Commons nine aged women, <lb/>
all widows or mothers of soldiers or sailors, and all in <lb/>
the direst need.</p>
<p>Subp&oelig;naed to give evidence before a Select <reg orig="Com-|mittee">Committee</reg> <lb/>
of the House of Commons, she was exhaustively <lb/>
cross-examined on this subject, of which no one was <lb/>
in a better position than she to furnish accurate and <lb/>
sympathetic information. And it is satisfactory to <lb/>
learn that the chief points concerning the amelioration <lb/>
of the existing state of things which Miss Weston <lb/>
specially urged, were all conceded by the Select <reg orig="Com-|mittee">Committee</reg>, <lb/>
and will, doubtless, ere long be brought into <lb/>
operation.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the bereaved wives and mothers, and in <lb/>
some cases the sisters also of the men drowned in the <lb/>
later disasters have all received pecuniary help, gifts <lb/>
of mourning and kindly letters from Miss Weston <lb/>
herself.</p>
<p>The great thing now desired is the establishment of <lb/>
a "Widows" Pension Fund," which shall ensure to each <lb/>
widow &pound;20 a-year, and the men are ready to <reg orig="contri-|bute">contribute</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="84" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0095"/>
all they can from their small pay to start it. <lb/>
Another desideratum is a National Insurance Fund, <lb/>
in which blue-jackets and marines shall be able to <lb/>
insure their lives, so that how ever and wherever they <lb/>
may die, whether on active duty, or in some sudden <lb/>
ocean calamity, or by the slow ravages of disease, the <lb/>
wife and children, or dependent mother, may be <lb/>
certainly provided for.</p>
<p>But while those excellent schemes are being thought <lb/>
out and arranged for, Miss Weston and her helpers <lb/>
are patiently working on, doing everything in their <lb/>
power for Jack and all who are dear to him. Year <lb/>
after year sees enlargement improvement, extension <lb/>
of benefits and fresh endeavours to supply every need.</p>
<p>It may interest some readers to learn that the sum <lb/>
of &pound;31, 10s. will build and furnish a cabin; &pound;21, 10s. <lb/>
a Bath Cubicle, &pound;5 a bed, and &pound;2 a locker, at the <lb/>
Royal Sailors' Rest at Devonport or Portsmouth, and <lb/>
the donor of either a cabin or a cubicle may have a <lb/>
brass put up on the door commemorating the gift with <lb/>
any inscription desired. But smaller gifts, down to <lb/>
the very smallest, are thankfully received and urgently <lb/>
required.</p>
<p>This brief sketch purports to have for its subject the <lb/>
life of Agnes Weston, but the lady herself seems to be <lb/>
well-nigh hidden by her great work. After all, how <lb/>
could we better describe what she is, than by telling <lb/>
what she has done? And her reward, as much of it <lb/>
at least as she can receive in this life, is the gratitude <lb/>
and love of countless noble, simple, manly hearts all <lb/>
the world over.</p>
<p>"Come along, Jack!" joyfully shouts a blue-jacket <lb/>
to his chummy, when the boatswain's mate gives out <lb/>
<pb n="85" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0096"/>
that Miss Weston has arrived on deck to give a little <lb/>
address to the men; "Come along! Here's yer naval <lb/>
mother come aboard, and wants to have a yarn with <lb/>
you! "</p>
<p>Then their bright, bronzed faces crowd round her <lb/>
in scores, ready and willing to hear and attend to <lb/>
what she has to say,&mdash;always words to do them good <lb/>
body and soul, having the promise of the life which <lb/>
now is, and that which is to come.</p>
<p>"Three sheets in the wind, mother!" sang a big <lb/>
tar, as he lurched into the Rest one night, very much <lb/>
the worse for drink. "I'm sorry that you should see <lb/>
it; but it is a long lane that has no turning, and you'll <lb/>
see me a better boy yet!"</p>
<p>And so, most likely, she will; Jack warmly <reg orig="appreci-|ates">appreciates</reg> <lb/>
patience and kindliness, and the affectionate <lb/>
interest of gentle Christian ladies. Quarrelsome as <lb/>
he is when tipsy, Miss Weston and her friends are <lb/>
always able to stop a fight; the men's fists instantly <lb/>
drop when one of them goes between the combatants. <lb/>
But the temperance work progresses grandly, and now, <lb/>
when a ship is paid off after a long voyage, instead of <lb/>
the dreadful scenes of drunkenness and violence which <lb/>
used to disgrace the streets, the men, quiet and orderly, <lb/>
go home with their money to their wives, or join their <lb/>
companions in the harmless festivities of the Sailors' <lb/>
Rest. Very often not one man of a whole ship's <reg orig="com-|pany">company</reg> <lb/>
will be seen the worse for drink.</p>
<p>Miss Weston's blue-jacket friends have been much <lb/>
distressed by her recent serious accident when <reg orig="bi-|cycling">bicycling</reg>. <lb/>
"Whatever did you get aboard such a <lb/>
risky craft as that for?" said one of them."A <reg orig="steam-|launch">steam-launch</reg>, <lb/>
now" &lpar;which we suppose is nautical for a <lb/>
<pb n="86" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0097"/>
railway-train!&rpar; "would ha'been safe enough." And <lb/>
to set their anxieties at rest, she has promised to give <lb/>
up the wheel.</p>
<p>No, the sailors would find it hard to lose their <lb/>
"naval mother," and we trust it may be many long <lb/>
years before they are called upon to do so.</p>
<p>Even now, with all we have said, space has failed <lb/>
us to tell as we would have wished of the monthly <lb/>
magazine, <hi rend="italic">Ashore and Afloat</hi>, a bright pennyworth <lb/>
which circulates by hundreds of thousands among our <lb/>
own naval and merchant seamen and fishermen, and <lb/>
is warmly welcomed by the United States' sailors as <lb/>
well; of the Employment Bureau for needy wives and <lb/>
widows; the Ambulance Classes, where Jack learns <lb/>
how to supply First Aid to a wounded comrade, and <lb/>
stem the flowing tide of life until doctor or hospital <lb/>
can be reached; and the newly organised Royal <lb/>
Sailors' Rest Volunteer Brigade, consisting of <reg orig="com-|panies">companies</reg> <lb/>
of children of the middle and upper classes who <lb/>
are willing to collect money for the work and send <lb/>
clothing or toys for Jack's little ones.</p>
<p>We must conclude, and we can scarcely do so <lb/>
more fittingly than by echoing the simple, heartfelt <lb/>
phrase uttered at a prayer-meeting on board H.M.S. <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Dryad</hi> the other day, when one of the blue-jackets <lb/>
after another said "God bless Miss Weston," and <lb/>
may she long be spared in health and activity to <lb/>
carry on her noble work "for the good of the Service <lb/>
and the glory of God."</p>

"LITTLE SUNSHINE."</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">In</hi> the Yorkshire village of Hauxwell, near <reg orig="Rich-|mond">Richmond</reg>, <lb/>
there lived, half-a-century ago, a good <lb/>
clergyman and his wife, named Pattison, and <lb/>
their large family of twelve children. The eldest and <lb/>
youngest of these were sons, and all the rest daughters.</p>
<p>The youngest of the ten girls was little Dorothy, <lb/>
or Dora, as she was commonly called, a winsome <lb/>
creature, gifted with extreme beauty, a merry spirit, <lb/>
and sweetness of temper, that made her the pet and <lb/>
darling of her older sisters; whose tenderness and <lb/>
care were frequently called into requisition by the <lb/>
attacks of illness to which Dora was subject during <lb/>
the whole of her childish days.</p>
<p>The Pattison family were noted for kindness and <lb/>
benevolence to their poorer neighbours. Although <lb/>
rich enough to have bestowed charity with ordinary <lb/>
freedom whenever it was needed, we are told that <lb/>
<pb n="90" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0101"/>
"the girls were always planning how to save their <lb/>
money to give it away, and they made a rule of <lb/>
carefully mending and re-making their old clothes, <lb/>
in order that they might not have to buy new ones." <lb/>
Also, they thought nothing of giving away their <lb/>
dinners and faring on bread-and-cheese themselves. <lb/>
"In fact," to quote again from Dora's biographer, <lb/>
"giving to others instead of spending on themselves, <lb/>
seems to have been the rule and delight of their lives; <lb/>
for not only did they liberally bestow money, but <lb/>
time, instruction, powers of mind and body, and above <lb/>
all, love and pity to those around them."</p>
<p>In such an atmosphere as this, was reared the fine <lb/>
nature of the little girl who was by-and-by to be <lb/>
enshrined in the hearts of thousands of her poor and <lb/>
suffering fellow-creatures as "Sister Dora."</p>
<p>Like all who leave an impress upon the world, <lb/>
Dorothy Pattison was possessed of a very decided <lb/>
"will of her own." She loved to have her own way; <lb/>
not so much because it was <hi rend="italic">her</hi> way, still less because <lb/>
it was in opposition to other people's way, but because <lb/>
she felt so strongly convinced that it was the best <lb/>
way. And we are bound to admit, so quick was her <lb/>
insight, and so true her judgment that, in after years, <lb/>
at least, she was generally right.</p>
<p>Not always, of course, and certainly not in her <lb/>
early days; as may be shown by a rather amusing <lb/>
anecdote, which also well illustrates the young lady's <lb/>
readiness of resource and that ingenuity in <reg orig="com-|passing">compassing</reg> <lb/>
the desired end which made her so effectual <lb/>
a power for good when her manifold gifts were <reg orig="con-|secrated">consecrated</reg> <lb/>

her dearly-loved and constant companion, were <reg orig="pro-|vided">provided</reg> <lb/>
one winter with velvet bonnets which by no <lb/>
means pleased their juvenile taste. Objections proved <lb/>
of no avail, the bonnets were bought, and they must <lb/>
be worn, unless&mdash;ah, here was the loop-hole of escape! <lb/>
&mdash;unless something happened to damage them.</p>
<p>One day, it poured with rain; mother had gone <lb/>
for a long drive, nurse and sisters were all conveniently <lb/>
out of the way; Dora, brimming over with her <lb/>
brilliant idea, ran to her sister. "Be quick; now's <lb/>
our chance of spoiling our bonnets!"</p>
<p>On went the luckless bonnets out at a window <lb/>
poked two naughty little heads, until the hated velvet <lb/>
was well soaked in the downpour of wet. Then, at <lb/>
the suggestion of far-sighted Dora, who did not wish a <lb/>
satisfactory hour's work to be undone by any remedial <lb/>
measure, they were taken off and stowed quietly away <lb/>
in their respective boxes all dripping as they were.</p>
<p>Sunday morning came, and the deplorable state of <lb/>
the velvet bonnets was then calmly announced by the <lb/>
chief culprit. "They are quite spoilt; we can never <lb/>
wear them any more."</p>
<p>But alas! the "best-laid schemes of mice" and <lb/>
naughty little girls, sometimes end in humiliating <lb/>
failure. The bonnets were worn that Sunday and for <lb/>
many Sundays after, so the plotters only succeeded in <lb/>
getting themselves "out of the frying-pan into the fire."</p>
<p>More creditable as well as more successful was the <lb/>
next instance we have on record of Dora's wilfulness. <lb/>
When she was about twelve years old, the sister <lb/>
mentioned above had a serious illness, and Dora, who <lb/>
had always been very fond of tending, washing and <lb/>
nursing her imaginary sick dollies, now begged and <lb/>
<pb n="92" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0103"/>
entreated to be allowed to sit up with the dear <lb/>
patient. This was at first firmly refused, but one <lb/>
night the devoted little sister smuggled herself into <lb/>
the room unobserved; when by-and-by discovered, she <lb/>
was rewarded for her persistence by being allowed to <lb/>
remain, and she helped to nurse her sister until the <lb/>
latter was well again.</p>
<p>A year or two later, Dora's overflowing helpfulness <lb/>
and disposition to carry out impulsively her own <lb/>
desires, both got her into disgrace at home, and gave <lb/>
her a singularly true foretaste of what she would have <lb/>
to go through in after life.</p>
<p>Fever was rife in the village of Hauxwell, and Dora, <lb/>
calling one day to inquire after an old woman who <lb/>
was ill, found her very bad and with no one to do <lb/>
anything for her. Immediately Dora, with no thought <lb/>
of permission from home to be asked or received, <lb/>
hung up her hat and cloak behind the door and <lb/>
resolved to stay. She washed, tended, and read to <lb/>
the poor woman, and when evening came she sent <lb/>
word to her parents of where she was and her <reg orig="in-|tention">intention</reg> <lb/>
to remain. Somewhat to her dismay the <lb/>
answer was returned, "You went without our <reg orig="permis-|sion">permission</reg>; <lb/>
now stay where you are until you are sent for."</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the careful ministrations of the <lb/>
devoted young nurse, her patient grew worse, and the <lb/>
next night she died. A neighbour then came in and <lb/>
helped, but by-and-by she was forced to go home, <lb/>
and Dora was left alone with the body. It is <reg orig="charac-|teristic">characteristic</reg> <lb/>
of the girl's pride and courage that she did not <lb/>
run away, but waiting quietly until the morning, sent <lb/>
the message to the rectory that the woman was dead, <lb/>
and "please, may I come home?"</p>
<pb n="93" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0104"/>
<p>But once more came the answer, "Stay where you <lb/>
are until you are sent for."</p>
<p>This was, however, shortly followed by the <reg orig="appear-|ance">appearance</reg> <lb/>
of the family carriage, and in it the old nurse, <lb/>
looking very stern and displeased. The sentence was <lb/>
that Dora was to be banished to the sea-side, both as <lb/>
a punishment and as a precaution against spreading <lb/>
infection, before being allowed to mix with her relations.</p>
<p>At hearing this, the irrepressible girl began to <lb/>
dance for joy, to the great scandalisation of nurse, <lb/>
who reminded her that she was in dire disgrace. She <lb/>
enjoyed a pleasant time, however, at the sea-side, <lb/>
notwithstanding nurse's grave refusal to allow her to <lb/>
invite to tea any of the children whose acquaintance <lb/>
she made upon the sands. And on returning home, <lb/>
in some trepidation, she was astonished to find herself <lb/>
received with kisses and caresses, and praises for her <lb/>
courage, until, as she said, "I was quite inflated, and <lb/>
did not know what to make of it all."</p>
<p>Dora did not like study. She was excused, on <lb/>
account of her frequent illnesses, from doing regular <lb/>
lessons while she was little; and when feeling well <lb/>
enough, she delighted in all sorts of out-of-door <lb/>
sports, rioting about "Just as wild, merry, and noisy <lb/>
as a boy." Even as a child she possessed wonderful <lb/>
patience and fortitude under suffering, her naturally <lb/>
sweet temper and brave spirit being rarely disturbed <lb/>
by her ill-health, while her love of fun and immense <lb/>
capacity for seeing the humorous side of everything&mdash; <lb/>
a gift which brightened her life until its latest day&mdash; <lb/>
bubbled over continually. Her father gave her the <lb/>
pet name of "Sunshine," and surely no more radiant <lb/>
creature ever "made sunshine in the shady places" of <lb/>
<pb n="94" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0105"/>
this dull old earth than did Sister Dora in the dark <lb/>
spots where she chose to spend her life.</p>
<p>It has been thought by some that our heroine did <lb/>
not, in her earliest days, show many signs of that <lb/>
wonderful aptitude for tending the sick which <reg orig="after-|wards">afterwards</reg> <lb/>
made her famous; but in addition to the <reg orig="illus-|trations">illustrations</reg> <lb/>
we have already given of her passionate love of <lb/>
helping those in need, she herself told a friend that as a <lb/>
child she used to say, "When I grow up, I '11 be a nurse, <lb/>
or a lady doctor, and do everything for my patients."</p>
<p>With this end in view, the little girl argued that it <lb/>
was no use for her to learn music and languages; she <lb/>
"didn't want to be a fine drawing-room lady." But <lb/>
her teachers showed her that a nice Christian nurse <lb/>
should learn everything she had time to learn. "How <lb/>
could she be certain she would never have French or <lb/>
German patients? and all like music."</p>
<p>This way of looking at the matter made Dora very <lb/>
much more content "And, dears," she would say to <lb/>
her young friends in after life, "there isn't a single <lb/>
thing, nor an accomplishment, that has not in some <lb/>
way been hallowed in this service for God. So never <lb/>
you feel that it is waste of time to get knowledge of <hi rend="italic">any <lb/>
kind</hi>; you can never tell how handy it may come in."</p>
<p>As Dora grew older and stronger, drawing in daily <lb/>
the health-giving air of the open moors which <reg orig="sur-|rounded">surrounded</reg> <lb/>
her home, she took great delight in all athletic <lb/>
sports&mdash;shooting, rowing, swimming, archery, skating, <lb/>
and even climbing trees, while, like all strong natures <lb/>
with an aptitude to rule, she loved to control a horse, <lb/>
and riding and driving were among her greatest joys. <lb/>
That she was a good and daring horsewoman it is <lb/>
unnecessary to say.</p>
<pb n="95" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0106"/>
<p>All these pursuits tended towards physical <reg orig="develop-|ment">development</reg> <lb/>
and strength. After a severe illness, when about <lb/>
fourteen years of age, Dora's health took a decided <lb/>
turn for the better, and during the next few years she <lb/>
bloomed out into a fine and robust young woman. <lb/>
At twenty years old she is described as "tall, strong, <lb/>
and healthy,&hellip;vigorous both at work and play, <lb/>
and with a restless energy which would not be satisfied <lb/>
with inaction of body or mind for one single moment." <lb/>
She, moreover, possessed regular features, brilliant <lb/>
dark-brown eyes, wavy dark hair, a beautiful <reg orig="com-|plexion">complexion</reg>, <lb/>
and great vivacity of expression. If we add <lb/>
to this an elegant figure, with the queenly height of <lb/>
five feet seven inches, a clear, rich voice, and last, <lb/>
but by no means least, mental powers that were far <lb/>
beyond the average, we may form some idea of the <lb/>
personal attractions which lent their aid to securing <lb/>
for Sister Dora the love and admiration which her <lb/>
noble character and unselfish disposition so abundantly <lb/>
merited.</p>

FREEDOM CLAIMED AND LIBERTY RESIGNED.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">It</hi> was when Dorothy Pattison was in the first flush <lb/>
and vigour of early womanhood that all England <lb/>
was moved with the story of Florence Nightingale's <lb/>
heroism and self-sacrifice in tending the wounded <lb/>
during the Crimean war.</p>
<p>No wonder that Dora became fired with enthusiasm, <lb/>
and longed to join the band of nurses who went out <lb/>
to help. It would have been work exactly to her <lb/>
<pb n="96" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0107"/>
taste; the travel and adventure which it involved, <lb/>
with perhaps a spice of danger added, appealed <reg orig="irre-|sistibly">irresistibly</reg> <lb/>
to every instinct of her brave and <reg orig="compassion-|ate">compassionate</reg> <lb/>
nature, and she implored her father to let her go.</p>
<p>Mr. Pattison, however, did not sympathise with his <lb/>
daughter's aspirations; we venture to think he did <lb/>
not understand her character, nor the urgings of rare <lb/>
though perhaps unconscious capability that were <reg orig="im-|pelling">impelling</reg> <lb/>
Dora to seek a wider sphere for her energies <lb/>
than quiet home-life in a tiny village could possibly <lb/>
afford.</p>
<p>He pointed out to her the indisputable fact that <lb/>
her want of training and discipline would stand very <lb/>
much in the way of her success in the mission which <lb/>
she wished to undertake; but instead of allowing her <lb/>
an opportunity of acquiring the necessary experience, <lb/>
he told her that her home duties were sufficient for <lb/>
her, if only she would think so.</p>
<p>Studying the girl's character in the light of her <lb/>
after-achievements, we cannot but judge that her <lb/>
father somewhat miscalculated her ability and <reg orig="ener-|gies">energies</reg>, <lb/>
and the exercise which they craved; and, while <lb/>
we should be far from encouraging the conceit of <lb/>
every inexperienced girl who felt herself fitted for <lb/>
higher things and rebelled at the humble ministries <lb/>
which life demanded of her, we think that Dorothy <lb/>
Pattison was sufficiently unique in both mental and <lb/>
physical constitution to be pardoned for desiring more <lb/>
room for the development of her extraordinary powers.</p>
<p>She has been called "restless," and represented as <lb/>
finding home-life "distasteful," but it seems to have <lb/>
only been the restlessness of a strong young creature <lb/>
chafing against the bars of a too narrow cage.</p>
<pb n="97" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0108"/>
<p>Dora, however, submitted for some years to the <lb/>
parental prohibition, and busied herself, with her <lb/>
sister, in nursing their mother, who was a great <reg orig="in-|valid">invalid</reg>, <lb/>
and in paying long visits to her elder brother, <lb/>
Mr. Mark Pattison, of Lincoln College, Oxford, who <lb/>
allowed her to help him both in his literary and <lb/>
mechanical work.</p>
<p>It was during one of her visits to this brother that <lb/>
Dora experienced one of those singular presentiments <lb/>
to which she all her life paid great, and, as it several <lb/>
times appeared, not unfounded regard. She had a <lb/>
dream, in which her mother appeared to her, drawing <lb/>
back the curtain of her bed and calling her by name.</p>
<p>Fearing to be laughed at by her matter-of-fact <lb/>
brother, she forbore to tell him of this dream, but the <lb/>
next night it was repeated, her mother calling her as <lb/>
before, and looking worn and ill. Then Dora insisted, <lb/>
in spite of her brother's ridicule, in sending to the <lb/>
neighbouring town for letters; and one was found <lb/>
there, three days delayed, which told that Mrs. Pattison <lb/>
was dangerously ill.</p>
<p>Dora set off homeward at once, to be with her <lb/>
mother, who was lying upon her death-bed, and shortly <lb/>
afterwards passed away.</p>
<p>After this bereavement, Dora's desire to leave home <lb/>
was stronger than ever. She longed to join a Church <lb/>
of England sisterhood, calling themselves the Good <lb/>
Samaritans, with some members of which she had <lb/>
become acquainted when visiting Redcar. Still Mr. <lb/>
Pattison disapproved; it was from him apparently <lb/>
that Dora inherited her inflexible will, along with his <lb/>
well-proportioned figure and stately bearing. Such <lb/>
instances of heredity are no uncommon cause of <lb/>
<pb n="98" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0109"/>
friction between parent and child. But eventually, a <lb/>
sort of compromise was arrived at, Dora being <reg orig="per-|mitted">permitted</reg>, <lb/>
though not cordially, to accept the position of <lb/>
village school-mistress in the parish of Little Woolston, <lb/>
near Bletchley, on the borders of Buckinghamshire.</p>
<p>Mr. Pattison told her that he should give her no <lb/>
more than the allowance she had always received, <lb/>
which, in addition to the school-mistress's modest <lb/>
salary, was all she would have to live upon. Possibly <lb/>
he imagined that the young lady would soon tire of <lb/>
a life of hard work and comparative privation and be <lb/>
glad to return, with chastened spirit, to the comforts <lb/>
of an affluent home.</p>
<p>With many, such would have been the result, but <lb/>
not with Dorothy Pattison. For three years she lived <lb/>
bravely and cheerily at Woolston, in a cottage all <lb/>
alone, and with no help in her domestic work except <lb/>
that of an old woman who came occasionally to do <lb/>
the hardest scrubbing.</p>
<p>She always loved little children, possessing a rare <lb/>
faculty for controlling, even while she made herself <lb/>
one with them; securing obedience to necessary rules <lb/>
in school time, though in play-hours she became a <lb/>
child again herself, delighting "in animals, flowers, a <lb/>
sunshiny day, a roll in a hay-cock, or a game of play <lb/>
of any kind."</p>
<p>Needless to say, Dora's beauty, her charming and <lb/>
high-bred manners, her ready smile, and the <reg orig="affec-|tionate">affectionate</reg> <lb/>
interest she took in her scholars and their <lb/>
homes, made her greatly beloved at Little Woolston, <lb/>
and here, too, among the poor and sick, she gained a <lb/>
great deal of that tact and experience which was <reg orig="by-|and-by">by-and-by</reg> <lb/>
to be so useful to her.</p>
<pb n="99" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0110"/>
<p>Although the young school-mistress did the most <lb/>
menial of her own house work, even blacking her grate <lb/>
with her own pretty hands, she was soon recognized <lb/>
as "a perfect lady" by those among whom she had <lb/>
taken up her abode. An old gentleman and his wife <lb/>
in the neighbourhood took such a fancy to her that <lb/>
they offered to make her their heiress. This <reg orig="gentle-|man">gentleman</reg> <lb/>
after Dora had left Little Woolston, used to send <lb/>
her ten pounds regularly every year to do as she liked <lb/>
with, on condition only that she should not <reg orig="acknow-|ledge">acknowledge</reg> <lb/>
the gift. However, she did acknowledge it&mdash; <lb/>
a piece of her old wilfulness&mdash;which eventually caused <lb/>
the privilege to be withdrawn.</p>
<p>A neglected cold&mdash;Dora, like most women of her <lb/>
type, finding it much easier to take care of others than <lb/>
of herself&mdash;resulted in a sharp attack of pleurisy, and <lb/>
brought her work at Little Woolston to an end. She <lb/>
went to Redcar to recuperate, and here the old <reg orig="yearn-|ing">yearning</reg> <lb/>
to join the Sisterhood was revived. She only <lb/>
went back to the scene of her scholastic labours to say <lb/>
good-bye to her friends, and then, in the autumn of <lb/>
1864, she attached herself to the Sisterhood of the <lb/>
Good Samaritans.</p>
<p>It is difficult to say whether, up to this point, Dora, <lb/>
notwithstanding her many good qualities, could be <lb/>
called a truly converted character. Before leaving <lb/>
home the first time, she had come under the influence <lb/>
of a mind more powerful than her own, and one <lb/>
which, alas! had tended only to shake her faith in the <lb/>
authenticity and inspiration of the Scriptures. <reg orig="Per-|haps">Perhaps</reg> <lb/>
it was in the hope that amid distinctly religious <lb/>
associations her difficulties might melt away; or <lb/>
perhaps she sought the aid of outward discipline in <lb/>
<pb n="100" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0111"/>
enabling her to manage that strong and indomitable <lb/>
will which might prove her greatest blessing, or the <lb/>
reverse. However that may be, Dorothy Pattison at <lb/>
the mature age of thirty-two voluntarily yielded <reg orig="her-|self">herself</reg> <lb/>
up, mind and body, to the dictates of a "Mother <lb/>
Superior," and became "Sister Dora" for evermore.</p>
<p>Everyone knows of the severe drilling in absolute <lb/>
submission and unquestioning obedience to which <lb/>
members of these sisterhoods, whether Romish or <lb/>
Protestant, are subjected; that any intelligent human <lb/>
being should relinquish her independence to the <reg orig="ex-|tent">extent</reg> <lb/>
demanded by those in authority is a marvel, and <lb/>
it is a greater marvel that such regimen should often <lb/>
appear most attractive to self-willed characters; but <lb/>
perhaps those feel a need of being broken in.</p>
<p>Sister Dora, however, was not conquered all at once, <lb/>
if indeed at all. The rough and menial work which <lb/>
was demanded of her was distasteful, and she sat <lb/>
down and cried, when, already tired out with heavy <lb/>
and unaccustomed labour, she was commanded to <reg orig="re-|make">remake</reg> <lb/>
the beds which she had just put in order, and <lb/>
which had been immediately pulled to pieces at the <lb/>
whim of some superior authority. Nevertheless, she <lb/>
was afterwards wont to assert that this harsh <reg orig="treat-|ment">treatment</reg> <lb/>
was "good" for her. No doubt, the intimate <lb/>
knowledge of all departments of domestic work which <lb/>
she gained at Coatham&mdash;;where the head-quarters of <lb/>
the sisterhood were situated&mdash;proved most useful to <lb/>
her in her later life.</p>
<p>After a while, Sister Dora was removed to a more <lb/>
congenial sphere of labour,namely,a Cottage Hospital <lb/>
at North Ormesby, near Middlesborough, which was <lb/>
worked by the "Samaritan" Sisters. And here she <lb/>
<pb n="101" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0112"/>
obtained her first practical knowledge of hospital <lb/>
management.</p>
<p>In the early part of 1865, she was sent to Walsall, <lb/>
afterwards to be indissolubly connected with her name.</p>
<p>Here, in one of the grimiest towns of the "Black <lb/>
Country," had been established a small hospital for <lb/>
the relief of accidents, under the control of the "Good <lb/>
Samaritans." At first the Sisters had been much <lb/>
opposed, owing to their supposed leanings towards <lb/>
Roman Catholicism, but gradually they won for <reg orig="them-|selves">themselves</reg> <lb/>
a good reputation by deeds of kindness and <lb/>
mercy, and almost the last instance of active <reg orig="persecu-|tion">persecution</reg> <lb/>
was the throwing of a stone at Sister Dora soon <lb/>
after her arrival, with the jeer of "There goes one of <lb/>
those Sisters of Misery!" We may add that she not <lb/>
long after had the pleasure of piling "coals of fire" <lb/>
upon the head of her assailant, by her devoted care of <lb/>
him when suffering from an injury received in a coal-pit.</p>
<p>Sister Dora had not been long at Walsall before <lb/>
she caught small-pox from the out-patients. She was <lb/>
very ill for some time, but does not seem to have had <lb/>
her beautiful skin marred in the slightest degree by <lb/>
the dreadful disease.</p>
<p>At this first visit our heroine was allowed to remain <lb/>
but a short time at Walsall, and seems for the <reg orig="re-|mainder">remainder</reg> <lb/>
of that year &lpar;1865&rpar; to have been sent <reg orig="back-|wards">backwards</reg> <lb/>
and forwards between Coatham, Walsall, and <lb/>
other places, in a disturbing fashion, probably designed <lb/>
to complete her education in perfect obedience.</p>
<p>But the finishing touch as regarded that <reg orig="indispens-|able">indispensable</reg> <lb/>
virtue was given about the middle of December.</p>
<p>The people of Walsall had by this time seen enough <lb/>
of Sister Dora to have some idea of her superior <lb/>
<pb n="102" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0113"/>
capabilities as a nurse. When, therefore, the <reg orig="Sister-|hood">Sisterhood</reg> <lb/>
proposed removing her permanently to <reg orig="Middles-|borough">Middlesborough</reg>, <lb/>
the committee and medical attendants at <lb/>
the Walsall Hospital objected.</p>
<p>While this subject was under discussion, news came <lb/>
to Sister Dora that her father was lying dangerously <lb/>
ill at Hauxwell. Having just received orders to go and <lb/>
nurse a private case in Devonshire, she telegraphed to <lb/>
Coatham for permission to go to her father instead.</p>
<p>It was refused, and the order to set out for <reg orig="Devon-|shire">Devonshire</reg> <lb/>
peremptorily repeated.</p>
<p>Dorothy's behaviour at this crisis shows, as Mrs. Henry <lb/>
Fawcett wisely observes, "the paralysis of moral sense <lb/>
which this cast-iron system &lpar;of obedience&rpar; produces."</p>
<p>The woman who resolutely followed the dictates of <lb/>
her own judgment in joining this Sisterhood when all <lb/>
her relations and friends were strongly opposed to it, <lb/>
had, in little more than one year, become so crushed <lb/>
and spiritless as to actually turn her back upon her own <lb/>
dying father at the command of a "Mother Superior"!</p>
<p>But the punishment which she thus brought upon <lb/>
herself, terrible as it was, seems to have stung Sister <lb/>
Dora into something like healthy life again.</p>
<p>The poor old father died, without a last glimpse of <lb/>
the "Sunshine" for whom he craved. <hi rend="italic">Then</hi>, Dora <lb/>
received permission to attend his funeral. But <reg orig="pos-|sibly">possibly</reg> <lb/>
shrinking from meeting her family under such <lb/>
painful circumstances, this was declined, with some <lb/>
bitter but well-deserved allusions to the prohibition <lb/>
which had preceded it; and from that time the bonds <lb/>
were gradually loosened between Sister Dora and <lb/>
the powers at Coatham, until eventually she became <lb/>
once more free.</p>

"A WINGLESS WEEK-DAY ANGEL."</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> authorities connected with the "Good <lb/>
Samaritan" Sisterhood having agreed to allow <lb/>
Sister Dora to remain in charge of the hospital at <lb/>
Walsall, she entered upon her permanent duties there <lb/>
with an eagerness which was doubtless in some <reg orig="meas-|ure">measure</reg> <lb/>
an attempt to drown sorrow with incessant work.</p>
<p>An intensifying of her religious feelings about this <lb/>
period, and a conviction that she was specially called <lb/>
by the Saviour to bring souls to Himself, would <lb/>
indeed have prompted her to exchange her adherence <lb/>
to the Order of the "Good Samaritans" for one of <lb/>
even stricter rule, demanding vows of celibacy, but <lb/>
this time the advice of friends prevailed, and she <lb/>
decided to remain where she was.</p>
<p>Sister Dora commenced her labours at Walsall so <lb/>
modestly and unobtrusively that her coming seems <lb/>
to have made no memorable impression upon anyone <lb/>
whom she met; but, like the broken cruse of perfume, <lb/>
a life like hers, pouring out sweetness and balm, could <lb/>
not long be hid. When her self-neglectful habit of <lb/>
sitting in damp clothes, rather than take the time and <lb/>
trouble to change them, eventually resulted in a <lb/>
severe illness, the anxious inquiries about her with <lb/>
which the hospital was besieged showed that her <lb/>
ministries among the very poorest of the people&mdash; <lb/>
those who were actually too low and wretched even <lb/>
to present themselves among the out-patients for <reg orig="treat-|ment&mdash;had">treatment&mdash;had</reg> <lb/>
not been without the fruit of grateful love.</p>
<p>It was during this illness that Dorothy made the <lb/>
<pb n="104" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0115"/>
acquaintance of the Rev. Richard Twigg, incumbent <lb/>
of St. James's, Wednesbury, whose teaching was her <lb/>
spiritual food and inspiration, and whose sympathy <lb/>
was her chief human support during the remainder of <lb/>
her life. It has been said that Mr. Twigg was almost <lb/>
the only friend who took pains not to gratify that love <lb/>
of admiration&mdash;excusable in so rarely and variously <lb/>
gifted a woman, if in any one!&mdash;which sometimes <lb/>
threatened to become a blemish in Sister Dora's <lb/>
beautiful character. He was not rendered dumb, as <lb/>
were most of the other men she met, by the charm of <lb/>
her brightness and beauty, but boldly found fault <lb/>
with her when he thought there was occasion, and by <lb/>
this means won her deepest respect.</p>
<p>In 1867, the Cottage Hospital proving inadequate <lb/>
to the needs of an increasing population, a larger one <lb/>
was built in a higher and more healthy situation. <lb/>
Here, in 1868, Sister Dora assumed full charge, and <lb/>
with the exception of one helper, a Mrs. H., who had <lb/>
known and loved her from childhood, and a couple of <lb/>
domestic servants, had the sole management of both <lb/>
indoor and out-patient departments; thus earning <lb/>
from her great friend, Bishop Selwyn, the well-merited <lb/>
title of "the one-horse chay."</p>
<p>Almost our heroine's first experience in her new <lb/>
quarters was that of an epidemic of small-pox.</p>
<p>Already exposed as the hospital and all connected <lb/>
with it were to the risk of contagion from out-patients, <lb/>
who sometimes came to have their wounds dressed <lb/>
with the eruption actually upon them, Sister Dora <lb/>
thought it could hardly be increased if she ventured <lb/>
to nurse the poor sufferers in their own homes. Thus, <lb/>
by economising her time, curtailing her own <reg orig="meal-|times">mealtimes</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="105" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0116"/>
and rest, and by lavish expenditure of that <lb/>
strength and energy with which she was so <reg orig="pheno-|menally">phenomenally</reg> <lb/>
endowed, she contrived to keep up all <reg orig="cus-|tomary">customary</reg> <lb/>
attendance to cases at the hospital, and also <lb/>
to carry her helpful ministrations into many a <reg orig="plague-|stricken">plague-stricken</reg> <lb/>
lane or slum of the town.</p>
<p>One night she was watching alone the last hours of <lb/>
a poor man who was dying of small-pox in its most <lb/>
virulent form. He was much attached to her, and as <lb/>
he felt his end nearing, probably being past realising <lb/>
the loathsome condition he was in, he raised himself <lb/>
up in bed and said, "Sister, kiss me before I die!"</p>
<p>And, taking him in her arms, Sister Dora complied <lb/>
with his request Afterwards, in total darkness, the <lb/>
one bit of candle having expired, she sat with him <lb/>
until he died.</p>
<p>Her knowledge of surgery&mdash;obtained at first <lb/>
by careful attention to the painstaking teaching <lb/>
of the doctor who attended the old hospital&mdash;had <lb/>
by this time become greatly enlarged. She was <reg orig="ex-|tremely">extremely</reg> <lb/>
clever at bone-setting, having, as might be <lb/>
expected, an exquisitely delicate touch, and she was <lb/>
strongly opposed to amputation except in cases of <lb/>
extreme danger.</p>
<p>On one occasion it was her proud and happy <lb/>
experience to save, by three weeks' incessant care, <lb/>
the mangled right arm of a young man who had met <lb/>
with a machinery accident, after the surgeon attending <lb/>
the case had declared it to be impossible. She called <lb/>
it <hi rend="italic">her</hi> arm, and long afterwards, when she was herself <lb/>
ill, the grateful patient would ring at the hospital <lb/>
door to inquire how she was, sending in the message, <lb/>
"Tell Sister it's <hi rend="italic">her arm</hi> that pulled the bell!"</p>
<pb n="106" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0117"/>
<p>Sister Dora was a great believer in the efficacy of <lb/>
prayer, and in this instance, as in many others, held <lb/>
that it was in answer to her fervent entreaties that the <lb/>
healing was granted which she so earnestly besought.</p>
<p>The sick children loved her. No one was so bright <lb/>
and funny with them as Sister Dora, no one was so <lb/>
strong and patient, or told such charming tales. Those <lb/>
who cried most bitterly for their mothers could soon be <lb/>
pacified if carried about by her on one arm, while she <lb/>
attended to the wants of grown-up patients with her <lb/>
other hand; and they would allow her to do things for <lb/>
them without a murmur that no one else could attempt.</p>
<p>Sister Dora's ever bubbling humour and merriment <lb/>
was one of her greatest gifts, and an inestimable <reg orig="bless-|ing">blessing</reg> <lb/>
both to herself and her charges. She managed <lb/>
to see the comical side in almost everything, and to <lb/>
make others share in her amusement.</p>
<p>The singularly perfect balance of her whole being, <lb/>
physical strength in proportion to her mental energy, <lb/>
and practical ability equal to both, had no doubt much <lb/>
to do with this marvellous woman's joyous and <reg orig="hope-|ful">hopeful</reg> <lb/>
disposition; for there was no wearisome fretting of <lb/>
the body against the spirit, and <hi rend="italic">vice vers&acirc;</hi>, no chafing <lb/>
of what she <hi rend="italic">would</hi> do against the limitations of what <lb/>
she <hi rend="italic">could</hi>. With Sister Dora, to will was to do. At <lb/>
the same time it is on record that her fortitude under <lb/>
physical pain was nothing short of Spartan; personal <lb/>
suffering she was able absolutely to ignore, and as was <lb/>
proved in her latter years she was able to work, to be <lb/>
cheerful and gay, even as it appeared, to thoroughly <lb/>
enjoy herself while bearing serious discomfort, if not <lb/>
acute pain.</p>
<p>Her muscular strength has been described by a <lb/>
<pb n="107" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0118"/>
doctor who knew her intimately as simply "gigantic." <lb/>
If a heavy man threw himself out of bed in delirium, <lb/>
she would pick him up in her arms as if he had been <lb/>
a child and put him back again. She was even known <lb/>
to carry, unaided, the dead body of an adult patient <lb/>
from the ward where he died, to the mortuary, rather <lb/>
than allow the corpse to remain in the same <reg orig="apart-|ment">apartment</reg> <lb/>
with sick persons.</p>
<p>This strength of limb was matched by firmness of <lb/>
nerve and general power of endurance. When the <lb/>
never-to-be-forgotten explosion occurred at the <reg orig="Bur-|chills">Burchills</reg> <lb/>
Ironworks, in which eleven men were most <reg orig="shock-|ingly">shockingly</reg> <lb/>
burned by molten metal, no woman could go <lb/>
near the unhappy sufferers on account of the fearful <lb/>
sight and smell of their charred bodies, but Sister Dora. <lb/>
Even the medical men of the town were "incessantly <lb/>
sick, and could hardly stay in the ward."</p>
<p>For ten days on this occasion she never went to bed, <lb/>
and scarcely ever left the ward. Her friend, the <lb/>
secretary of the hospital, did all he could for her, and <lb/>
one brave lady helper contrived to stay with her at <lb/>
night. Only two of the sufferers recovered, and it <lb/>
soon became evident that the ward in which they had <lb/>
all been nursed had become so completely <reg orig="impreg-|nated">impregnated</reg> <lb/>
with the poison from their wounds as to be <lb/>
rendered permanently useless, case after case of <reg orig="ery-|sipelas">erysipelas</reg> <lb/>
occurring in subsequent patients.</p>
<p>This ultimately necessitated the pulling down of <lb/>
nearly the whole hospital, but of that more anon. We <lb/>
mention the episode here, though it belongs to a later <lb/>
period of Sister Dora's history, as an instance of what <lb/>
she could and did bear in the way of personal <reg orig="incon-|venience">inconvenience</reg> <lb/>
for the sake of her patients.</p>
<pb n="108" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0119"/>
<p>She never wearied of attending to their smallest <lb/>
needs. Above every bed was a rope communicating <lb/>
with a bell at the head of her own bed. No matter <lb/>
how many times in the night the bell was rung, no <lb/>
sufferer ever had to ring twice to bring Sister Dora to <lb/>
his side, and ever she came with a bright face.</p>
<p>"Don't trouble about that!" was her cheerful reply, <lb/>
if any of her charges apologised for often disturbing <lb/>
her. "I am here to wait upon you, and I am always <lb/>
pleased to render you any assistance in your suffering."</p>
<p>Sister Dora's courage equalled her endurance. She <lb/>
would venture on her errands of mercy into the lowest <lb/>
parts of the town, amongst persons of the worst repute, <lb/>
at any hour of the day or night. She would not <lb/>
hesitate to interfere in a street brawl, and with her <lb/>
own strong hands part the furious combatants. <lb/>
But the moral influence won by her compassionate <lb/>
tenderness to the poorest of the people, of whom in <lb/>
the course of years there were few who had not for <lb/>
some cause or other passed under her care, was such <lb/>
that Sister Dora was a sacred being in Walsall, and her <lb/>
very name a talisman to ensure immunity from harm.</p>
<p>When war was being waged in Servia, our heroine <lb/>
longed to go out and nurse the wounded, <reg orig="circum-|stances">circumstances</reg> <lb/>
just then offering some possibility of leaving, <lb/>
for a time, her hospital work.</p>
<p>"But, Sister Dora," it was suggested, "do you think <lb/>
your sex or position would be a safeguard against <lb/>
those barbarous Turks?" "No, not at all," was the <lb/>
reply. "But then I have only one life, and it doesn't <lb/>
altogether rest with them whether I lose it or not." <lb/>
"But they don't kill people right off," argued the <lb/>
objector; "they mutilate them." "Yes; cut off my <lb/>
<pb n="109" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0120"/>
ears, and my nose; and if they did that, I should say, <lb/>
'Take my life.'" "Well, and if they did all that?" <lb/>
"Then," was the calm response, "I should 'enter into <lb/>
life maimed.'"</p>
<p>Of two things, however, Sister Dora was afraid, <lb/>
dogs &lpar;strange to say!&rpar; and rats. "She would," says <lb/>
her biographer, Miss Lonsdale, "shrink behind a <reg orig="com-|panion">companion</reg> <lb/>
if she met even a very small cur in the streets." <lb/>
And an account of a fight with a rat in one of the <lb/>
hospital passages we have in her own graphic words. <lb/>
She assaulted it with a poker, uttering a scream with <lb/>
every blow she dealt. All the patients who were <lb/>
able to get out of bed, crowded to watch the fray. <lb/>
"Give it him, Sister!" they cried. "But," she <reg orig="con-|cluded">concluded</reg>, <lb/>
in describing the scene to a visitor, "what <lb/>
nerves he must have had to stand my yells as well as <lb/>
the dabs with the poker! I should have thought <lb/>
either sufficient to frighten any ordinary rat to death."</p>
<p>Our sketch of Sister Dora's character would be <lb/>
sadly imperfect did we not speak of her earnest <lb/>
piety and her constant desire to be a means of <lb/>
bringing health to the souls as well as the bodies of <lb/>
her patients. She read prayers with them daily, <lb/>
taking her stand in such a position on one of the <lb/>
landings that those in each of the three wards could <lb/>
hear and join in, and it was no uncommon thing, <lb/>
when it was her turn to watch at night, for a sick <lb/>
man to find her on her knees by his bedside, praying <lb/>
individually for him.</p>
<p>"Oh, how sorry we shall be," she once wrote to <lb/>
a friend, "&lpar;if there be sorrow in heaven&rpar;, if we should <lb/>
enter in at the gate, and enjoy ourselves to all <lb/>
eternity, to think how little we did to help others <lb/>
<pb n="110" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0121"/>
on the narrow way! When I think of it I feel as if <lb/>
I could be all day long on ray knees, praying for <lb/>
poor sinners; and I am overwhelmed with regret <lb/>
when I think of the hours I have wasted-the souls <lb/>
that have come and gone out of the hospital, and <lb/>
I have not led them to Christ."</p>
<p>Whenever a mission was held in Walsall, Sister <lb/>
Dora, notwithstanding that her life was already <lb/>
crammed to overflowing with work, would not only <lb/>
find time to attend the services herself, but what <lb/>
was infinitely more useful, she would take pains <lb/>
to persuade as many as she could of her present <lb/>
and former patients to go with her.</p>
<p>In this work, her intimate knowledge of, and great <lb/>
influence over the lower classes in the town was an <lb/>
immense help to her. On one occasion, by venturing <lb/>
into one of the vilest slums in the place, she persuaded <lb/>
a number of "fallen" women&mdash;a class for whom she <lb/>
had long felt the utmost concern&mdash;to go to midnight <lb/>
meetings arranged for their special benefit. During <lb/>
that particular mission week she would seem to have <lb/>
laboured almost incessantly, both by night and day.</p>
<p>Just at that time, her hospital labours were <reg orig="in-|creased">increased</reg> <lb/>
rather than diminished by a necessary move <lb/>
into a temporary house; notwithstanding, "as soon <lb/>
as she had 'dressed her wounds' as she called it, and <lb/>
put all her patients to bed, she started forth to her <lb/>
cabmen's gathering. When that was over she must <lb/>
have gone straight on to the midnight meeting; and <lb/>
when it is remembered that she never appeared in the <lb/>
wards of her hospital later than 6.30 A.M., it becomes <lb/>
evident that she burnt both ends of the candle at once, <lb/>
and that pretty fiercely, during the mission week."</p>
<pb n="111" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0122"/>
<p>Sister Dora's devoted friend, Miss Ridsdale, has <lb/>
called her in some sweet verses which we regret that <lb/>
space forbids us to quote, "A wingless, week-day <lb/>
angel," and the whole of her fourteen years' labour at <lb/>
Walsall,&mdash;;the flower of her all too short life,&mdash;was <lb/>
a living embodiment of the sentiments of Wesley's <lb/>
hymn&mdash;a great favourite with her, of which one verse <lb/>
exhorts as follows: &mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l rend="indent">"Then let us attend</l>
<l rend="indent">Our Heavenly Friend,</l>
<l rend="indent">In His members distrest,</l>
<l>By want or affliction or sickness opprest;</l>
<l rend="indent">The prisoner relieve,</l>
<l rend="indent">The stranger receive;</l>
<l rend="indent">Supply all their wants,</l>
<l>And spend and be spent in assisting His saints,</l>
<l rend="indent">By word and by deed,</l>
<l rend="indent">The bodies in need,</l>
<l rend="indent">The souls to relieve,</l>
<l>And, freely as Jesus hath given, to give."</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>In the second small-pox epidemic at Walsall, <lb/>
which occurred in 1875, Sister Dora left the Cottage <lb/>
Hospital on the hill in charge of her assistants, and <lb/>
went to superintend the epidemic hospital down in <lb/>
the town. She was induced to do this by the fact <lb/>
that nothing would persuade the sufferers from that <lb/>
fearfully contagious malady to quit their homes and <lb/>
avail themselves of the isolation so strongly necessary <lb/>
but the knowledge that they were to be nursed by <lb/>
their beloved Sister Dora.</p>
<p>In this place, amid scenes and experiences too <lb/>
loathsome to describe, was the devoted woman <reg orig="im-|mured">immured</reg> <lb/>
from February until August of that memorable <lb/>
year, often with little help, or none at all, cooking, <lb/>
<pb n="112" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0123"/>
cleaning, day and night nursing, all to be done by <lb/>
one pair of hands! No wonder a doctor said&mdash;on <lb/>
hearing how she had grappled with a delirious man, <lb/>
a big, heavy fellow, in the worst stage of the disease, <lb/>
holding him in bed by main force until assistance <lb/>
arrived&mdash;"Her strength was superhuman. I never <lb/>
saw such a woman."</p>
<p>And if her physical power be so described. what <lb/>
shall we say of her self-sacrificing devotion, when <lb/>
we read that "she was in the habit of bringing back <lb/>
to life, patients who had sunk into the first stage of <lb/>
the fatal collapse which often precedes death from <lb/>
small-pox, by actually putting her mouth to theirs, <lb/>
and breathing into them, until vitality was restored"?</p>
<p>With such an angelic nature, we do not love Sister <lb/>
Dora the less for glimpses of tastes and desires <reg orig="in-|tensely">intensely</reg> <lb/>
human, and an evidence of her thorough <lb/>
naturalness is afforded by her request, at this trying <lb/>
time, for sensational novels, to keep her awake when <lb/>
watching with the sick at night, and by her na&iuml;ve <reg orig="con-|fession">confession</reg> <lb/>
afterwards, "Oh, I did enjoy those stories!" <lb/>
Indeed, she was ready to enjoy everything from <lb/>
which any form of innocent pleasure&mdash;mental, moral, <lb/>
spiritual, or physical&mdash;was to be obtained, from the <lb/>
quiet seclusion of the epidemic hospital during Lent, <lb/>
to a peep at a military review, or the comical notion <lb/>
of a patient that a bite from a dog might be healed <lb/>
by plastering the wound with dog's hairs!</p>
<p>She played as vigorously as she worked. Her <lb/>
holidays were few and brief, but how she revelled <lb/>
in them! Laying aside her "sister's" dress for <lb/>
greater freedom and to avoid comment, she bathed <lb/>
or skated, walked or swam, as the season dictated <lb/>
<pb n="113" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0124"/>
A friend with whom she spent one of her latest <lb/>
vacations says that "under her leadership we scaled <lb/>
fences, forded streams, with or without <reg orig="stepping-|stones">steppingstones</reg>, <lb/>
wished at the Wishing Well, and enjoyed <lb/>
a thorough scramble." Once, when at the sea-side, <lb/>
she merrily took a shrimping-net from the hands of <lb/>
a poor old woman who was wielding it with small <lb/>
success, and soon succeeded in catching for her eight <lb/>
or ten-pennyworth, being proportionately delighted <lb/>
with her success.</p>
<p>She was, indeed, up to this time an instance of <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">mens sana in corpore sano;</hi> but, alas! a time was <lb/>
near when that bright spirit would be called to a <lb/>
dire inward conflict with disease and death.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">It</hi> must occur to some readers to wonder that, with <lb/>
all her attractive gifts of mind and body, Sister <lb/>
Dora was never married.</p>
<p>Twice the opportunity was presented to her; the <lb/>
first time, which was before she left Coatham, her <lb/>
affections were not sufficiently engaged to induce her <lb/>
to give up the mode of life she had so recently chosen; <lb/>
but on the second occasion, some years after, she <lb/>
allowed herself to become actually betrothed.</p>
<p>The man, we are told&mdash;and how much of Sister <lb/>
Dora's heart-history may not be imagined from those <lb/>
few suggestive words!&mdash;"was her superior in every <lb/>
respect but one, he had no faith in revealed religion," <lb/>
and it is hinted that her attachment to him was very deep.</p>
<pb n="114" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0125"/>
<p>Her conduct in permitting an engagement to come <lb/>
about under such circumstances has been criticised by <lb/>
her biographer as most unfair to her lover and <reg orig="disre-|spectful">disrespectful</reg> <lb/>
to the faith which she professed, but we <reg orig="pre-|fer">prefer</reg> <lb/>
not to sit in judgment upon even the weaknesses <lb/>
of so noble a character. Suffice it to say, that when <lb/>
the friend whose advice she valued beyond all others <lb/>
urged upon her that nothing but apostasy or life-long <lb/>
unhappiness could be expected to result from such a <lb/>
union, she ultimately retracted her promise and turned <lb/>
her back for ever upon the joys of home life, and the <lb/>
possibility, always regarded by her as a supreme <reg orig="bless-|ing">blessing</reg>, <lb/>
of having little ones of her own to love and tend.</p>
<p>From this time forward, Sister Dora's disregard for <lb/>
her own health became greater than ever, and her <lb/>
confessed longing for the privilege of dying in the <lb/>
service of her fellow-creatures more intense.</p>
<p>It was in 1876 that, owing to the circumstances we <lb/>
have already recorded, it was decided to pull down <lb/>
the hospital which had been in use since 1868, and <lb/>
build a new and larger one. During the <reg orig="reconstruc-|tion">reconstruction</reg> <lb/>
the patients were removed to a house in the town, <lb/>
which proved very inconvenient and unsuitable for the <lb/>
purpose, besides entailing upon Sister Dora a walk of <lb/>
ten minutes up the hill in all weathers to give <reg orig="attend-|ance">attendance</reg> <lb/>
in the out-patients' department, which was still <lb/>
left standing, to the sixty or a hundred sufferers who <lb/>
would sometimes be seen by her in a single afternoon.</p>
<p>During the winter succeeding this temporary <lb/>
removal, Sister Dora, for the first time in her <reg orig="experi-|ence">experience</reg>, <lb/>
began to feel some failure of her wonderful <lb/>
strength. For some weeks she paid little heed, but as <lb/>
the difficulty increased instead of diminishing, she at <lb/>

last consulted a medical man, and submitted to an <lb/>
examination.</p>
<p>Soon she knew that the fiat had gone <reg orig="forth&mdash;ex-|pected">forth&mdash;expected</reg>, <lb/>
through some strange presentiment, for more <lb/>
than a year past, though not in the guise in which it <lb/>
actually came&mdash;"Thou shalt die, and not live."</p>
<p>Impelled by some motive which no one has been <lb/>
able quite to understand, Sister Dora extorted from <lb/>
this doctor a pledge of inviolable secrecy, and went on <lb/>
with her work just the same as usual.</p>
<p>Cancer, the dread disease which had claimed her for <lb/>
its victim, is of slow development. All through the <lb/>
year 1877 it preyed upon this Spartan woman <reg orig="unsus-|pected">unsuspected</reg> <lb/>
by the dearest friend, or those who worked with <lb/>
her night and day. Bright, merry, capable as ever, <lb/>
the only difference which might have struck those who <lb/>
knew her was that a little pony-carriage which had <lb/>
been presented to her as a tribute of gratitude some <lb/>
time before, was used more than formerly for driving <lb/>
to see patients who could not be received into the <lb/>
hospital.</p>
<p>In January, 1878, she wrote in acknowledgment of <lb/>
a letter received on her last birthday:&mdash;"I could go on <lb/>
writing until my ideas all ran to ink, and there would <lb/>
be none left.&hellip; It was a glad day to me. The world <lb/>
seemed so full of warm, loving hearts. Such lots of <lb/>
nice letters and remembrances; and then, I am so <lb/>
sure of the Loving Heart above, and being another <lb/>
year nearer Home."</p>
<p>To a perplexed young friend she wisely wrote: <lb/>
"No one thing in itself is much better than another, <lb/>
and no one can better themselves in any case by <reg orig="step-|ping">stepping</reg> <lb/>
out of the place in which the Master puts them."</p>
<pb n="118" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0129"/>
<p>In the month of June, 1878, Sister Dora went away <lb/>
for a fortnight's holiday, and almost immediately on <lb/>
her return an outbreak of typhoid fever necessitated <lb/>
the closing of the temporary hospital, and again <lb/>
released her from the work which she was destined <lb/>
never to resume. Then, the first use she made of her <lb/>
liberty was to gather together as many of her old <lb/>
patients as she could, with night nurses and servants <lb/>
connected with the hospital, and treat them all to a <lb/>
day's outing at Lichfield.</p>
<p>In the light of our knowledge that she had entered <lb/>
upon the last half-year of her life, it is almost <reg orig="in-|credible">incredible</reg> <lb/>
to read that "she was in unusually high <lb/>
spirits, talking and laughing with them in the train, <lb/>
and actually jumping out to gather some flowers <lb/>
which grew on the railway banks while the train <lb/>
stopped unexpectedly."</p>
<p>A little later she went to join some of her nieces in <lb/>
the Isle of Man, and on this occasion not only enjoyed <lb/>
sea-bathing herself, but took the opportunity of <reg orig="teach-|ing">teaching</reg> <lb/>
her nieces to swim.</p>
<p>In the autumn she went to Paris, to see the <reg orig="Exhibi-|tion">Exhibition</reg>, <lb/>
and was delighted with all she saw. But about <lb/>
the end of September came a sudden collapse. She <lb/>
was in London at the time, and at once hurried to <lb/>
Birmingham to consult the doctor who shared her <lb/>
terrible secret. Here she became so very ill, that it <lb/>
was feared she could not be removed to Walsall alive. <lb/>
Early in October, however, the journey was <reg orig="accom-|plished">accomplished</reg>.</p>
<p>For the next three months Sister Dora's sufferings <lb/>
were agonising. Once she wrote, "I have not had <lb/>
two hours' sleep for four days and nights, but in the <lb/>
<pb n="119" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0130"/>
midst of the fiery furnace there was a form like unto <lb/>
the Son of God."</p>
<p>Soon, however, writing became impossible, and she <lb/>
could only dictate letters to her friends, who were still <lb/>
kept in ignorance of the true nature of her complaint, <lb/>
and the disease being complicated with lung trouble <lb/>
which caused a racking cough, everybody believed <lb/>
that she was dying of consumption.</p>
<p>On the 4th of November, the new hospital was <lb/>
declared by the Mayor to be open "in the name of <lb/>
Sister Dora." It was a pathetic ceremony, for it <lb/>
was then known to all that in spite of lingering <lb/>
hopes, their "dear lady's" bright face would never <lb/>
smile among them again.</p>
<p>It was hard to realise, for she still rallied again <lb/>
and again, her marvellous constitution resisting the <lb/>
inroads of disease. On her better days, she would <lb/>
receive many visitors, and laugh and joke with them <lb/>
as of old, until the thought of death in connection <lb/>
with that irrepressible spirit appeared impossible. <lb/>
But there were other times when the horror of the <lb/>
approaching struggle seemed almost to overwhelm <lb/>
her. She believed it probable that the end would <lb/>
come during one of her severe fits of coughing, and <lb/>
the idea was terrible to her. Nevertheless, one of <lb/>
her nurses, who had watched many death-beds, <lb/>
testified, "I <hi rend="italic">never</hi> saw such faith and patience."</p>
<p>During the week before Christmas, she repeatedly <lb/>
said, "I hope I shall sing my Christmas Carol in <lb/>
heaven!" But release had been so long-expected <lb/>
and delayed that as the days passed on it seemed <lb/>
unlikely that her desire would be granted.</p>
<p>But Heaven was merciful, and the last earthly <lb/>
<pb n="120" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0131"/>
wish of this prayerful soul who had won so many <lb/>
boons for others was not to be refused. On the <lb/>
afternoon of the 24th of December, the spirit of <lb/>
Sister Dora passed peacefully and painlessly away.</p>
<p>The funeral, by her own special request, was as <lb/>
plain as possible, but it was attended by <reg orig="grief-|stricken">grief-stricken</reg> <lb/>
mourners in throngs, from almost every <lb/>
rank in society, bishops and town magnates, rough <lb/>
men and ragged women, testifying alike, with tearful <lb/>
eyes, to the sincerity of their sorrow.</p>
<p>Various memorials have been raised by the people <lb/>
of Walsall in honour of her whom they love to call <lb/>
"<hi rend="italic">Our</hi> sister Dora." &pound;700 were collected for the <lb/>
Convalescent Home which was the object nearest <lb/>
to her heart at the time of her death; a life-like <lb/>
portrait of her was painted for the Board-Room of <lb/>
the Hospital; and a magnificent stained-glass window, <lb/>
costing about &pound;300, was placed in the parish church.</p>
<p>But the grandest and most conspicuous of all is <lb/>
the beautiful statue of Sister Dora, which occupies <lb/>
a central position in the town; this, with its pedestal <lb/>
and relievo representing her attending to the sufferers <lb/>
from the Burchills Explosion, cost &pound;1050, a great <lb/>
part of which was contributed in small sums by the <lb/>
working-men, who preferred a white marble statue to <lb/>
any other form of memorial. It was unveiled in the <lb/>

A REMARKABLE CHILD.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">When</hi> some future historian takes up his pen <lb/>
to describe the social progress of England <lb/>
during the latter half of the nineteenth <lb/>
century, there will be one family, neither rich, titled, <lb/>
nor politically conspicuous, whose work and influence <lb/>
it will be impossible to ignore.</p>
<p>The world has probably never seen a more <reg orig="remark-|able">remarkable</reg> <lb/>
group of men and women, bound together by <lb/>
the closest ties of both sympathy and blood, than <lb/>
those bearing the now universally famous name of <lb/>
Booth, nor one whose spiritual power over their own <lb/>
generation has been so far-reaching and deep.</p>
<p>From Arctic snows to the burning sands of Africa, <lb/>
from inventive America to quaint Japan, the Salvation <lb/>
Army has become a household word, and the "Mother <lb/>
of the Army" was Catherine Booth.</p>
<p>Born at Ashbourne, in Derbyshire, in January, <lb/>
1829, when the reactionary fervour and strictness <lb/>
of Methodism was still thrilling a slumbering Church, <lb/>
<pb n="124" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0135"/>
Kate Mumford was reared in a family where both <lb/>
elements appear to have been exemplified in a marked <lb/>
degree. Her father, John Mumford, was a lay <lb/>
preacher belonging to the Wesleyan body, while <lb/>
her mother, a woman of great strength of character <lb/>
united to religious earnestness, though brought up <lb/>
in the Church of England, had been converted, before <lb/>
her marriage, under the influence of a Methodist <lb/>
mission.</p>
<p>Little Catherine, a striking-looking girl, with <reg orig="flash-|ing">flashing</reg> <lb/>
black eyes and curly hair, was the only daughter <lb/>
in a family of five, and of her brothers, the youngest <lb/>
alone survived his infancy; her position, therefore, <lb/>
was almost like that of an only child.</p>
<p>Mrs. Mumford held very decided views on the <lb/>
subject of the training of children, and so convinced <lb/>
was she of the prevalence of parental neglect and the <lb/>
dangers of bad companionship, that she did not <lb/>
permit her little girl and boy to mix with any <reg orig="play-|mates">playmates</reg> <lb/>
of their own age; nor did Catherine even attend <lb/>
school until she was twelve years old.</p>
<p>Mrs. Mumford, however, did her best to make <lb/>
up for this deprivation by being herself her little <lb/>
daughter's constant companion and confidante, and <lb/>
it is very possible that to a child of Catherine's <lb/>
delicate physique and precociously thoughtful mind, <lb/>
this comradeship was even more congenial than that <lb/>
of average juveniles would have been.</p>
<p>But although romping games and fascinating <reg orig="story-|books">storybooks</reg> <lb/>
were alike denied to little Kate, she was not <lb/>
wholly without the natural joys of childhood, for it is <lb/>
recorded that she possessed a family of dolls to which <lb/>
she was devotedly attached. As is usual with <lb/>
<pb n="125" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0136"/>
children, Kate's play was both a faithful reflection of <lb/>
her surroundings and a forecast of her future life. <lb/>
Not only did she wash, feed, and industriously sew <lb/>
for her wax and wooden babies, but we are told that <lb/>
she would even <hi rend="italic">pray</hi> with them, in the earnestness of <lb/>
her maternal zeal!</p>
<p>It is needless to say that Mrs. Mumford's daughter <lb/>
was early taught to read and love her Bible, and before <lb/>
she was twelve years old she had read entirely through <lb/>
the sacred book eight times, thus early acquiring that <lb/>
familiarity with Scripture which was to be of such <lb/>
service to the world in years to come.</p>
<p>Although trained, in some respects, with so much <lb/>
strictness, it would not appear that the little girl <lb/>
was unduly repressed. She was allowed to join in <lb/>
the conversation of her parents at an early age, and <lb/>
even when visitors were present. "By the time <lb/>
I was twelve," she says, "I had my own ideas in <lb/>
politics, and could fight my father across the table. <lb/>
Among other matters discussed was the Catholic <lb/>
Emancipation Bill. My father was in favour of it, <lb/>
while I was very much opposed to it, arguing that the <lb/>
way in which the Catholics had invariably misused <lb/>
political power proved that they were unfit to be <reg orig="in-|trusted">intrusted</reg> <lb/>
with it."</p>
<p>Catherine's sympathies were always with the poor <lb/>
and wretched, and being by moral constitution as <lb/>
high-spirited and brave as she was fragile in body, she <lb/>
never lacked the courage to act up to her convictions. <lb/>
A striking incident of early life will prove this.</p>
<p>While bowling her hoop in the street one day, she <lb/>
saw a drunken man being dragged to the <reg orig="police-|station">police-station</reg> <lb/>
by a constable, and followed by a jeering, <lb/>
<pb n="126" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0137"/>
hooting crowd. Instantly a sense of profound pity <lb/>
for the unfortunate culprit overmastered the horror <lb/>
which a gently nurtured little girl must naturally have <lb/>
felt, and springing to the man's side, Kate walked <lb/>
with him to the lock-up; a true foreshadowing of the <lb/>
courage and tenderness which in time to come was to <lb/>
make Mrs. Booth the friend and champion of the <reg orig="out-|cast">outcast</reg> <lb/>
all the world over.</p>
<p>Equally brave was she in defence of the dumb <reg orig="crea-|tion">creation</reg>, <lb/>
and many an over-driven horse or goaded sheep <lb/>
would have blessed the name of one who not only <lb/>
pitied its sufferings but had the courage to interfere on <lb/>
its behalf, had it but possessed the tongue to speak.</p>
<p>In after years she frequently took clandestine <lb/>
supplies of food to poor, under-fed animals which she <lb/>
noticed in the fields, and many a threepenny or <reg orig="six-|penny">sixpenny</reg> <lb/>
bit did she bestow upon seaside donkey-boys <lb/>
along with bright, kindly exhortations to be good to <lb/>
the animals in their care.</p>
<p>It is not surprising to learn that Kate Mumford was <lb/>
one of those children who take real pleasure in <reg orig="attend-|ance">attendance</reg> <lb/>
at religious services, nor that she was deeply and <lb/>
practically interested in the progress of missions to <lb/>
the heathen. She voluntarily denied herself, and was <lb/>
also indefatigable in begging for money from others <lb/>
in order to help in sending the Gospel abroad.</p>
<p>Another philanthropic movement which aroused <lb/>
the enthusiasm of this remarkable child was that for <lb/>
the promotion of total abstinence. Before she had <lb/>
reached her teens we find her writing impassioned <lb/>
letters to the magazines for which her father <reg orig="sub-|scribed">subscribed</reg>, <lb/>
concealing her identity beneath a <hi rend="italic">nom de <lb/>
plume</hi>, and even getting the manuscripts copied out by <lb/>
<pb n="127" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0138"/>
a friend that the editors might not be prejudiced by <lb/>
guessing the extreme youth of the writer. Whether <lb/>
any of these early effusions ever appeared in print, <lb/>
we are not told.</p>
<figure id="f26" rend="block" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0138">
<head>BEFRIENDING THE DRUNKARD.</head>
</figure>
<p>In the year 1834, the Mumfords removed to Boston <lb/>
in Lincolnshire, and amongst the members of the <lb/>
chapel there was a lady, of great devotion and ability, <lb/>
who was principal of a girls' school. So great was the <lb/>
friendship and esteem which Mrs. Mumford conceived <lb/>
<pb n="128" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0139"/>
for this lady, that in 1841 she arranged, prejudiced as <lb/>
she had previously been to any but home education, <lb/>
for Catherine to attend her seminary.</p>
<p>During the girl's two years of school life, she won <lb/>
the greatest affection and regard from her teacher, <lb/>
though even her unselfish dislike to surpass or <lb/>
humiliate others by her superior gifts did not wholly <lb/>
relieve her from the consequences of youthful jealousy. <lb/>
Possibly her long isolation from other children had <lb/>
somewhat unfitted her for their teasing and tricks, for <lb/>
we hear now of occasional violent outbursts of temper, <lb/>
for which, however, Kate was always deeply sorry <lb/>
when the irritation had passed away.</p>
<p>History and geography were her favourite studies, <lb/>
especially the former, and the way in which she would <lb/>
analyse and compare the characters brought before <lb/>
her, inquiring into their motives, and meditating on <lb/>
the use they made of their power, whether for selfish <lb/>
aggrandisement or the benefit of the poor, is another <lb/>
indication of the strong and early bent of her mind <lb/>
towards practical philanthropy.</p>
<p>Arithmetic she did not like, but in composition she <lb/>
excelled. We hear nothing about music, and French <lb/>
was a tabooed accomplishment on account of Mrs. <lb/>
Mumford's extreme fear that it might lead to the <lb/>
perusal of pernicious literature in that language. In <lb/>
after years, however, Catherine considered that in this <lb/>
particular her mother had made a mistake.</p>
<p>Kate's school days were of comparatively short <lb/>
duration. When she was fourteen years old they <lb/>
were brought to a premature close by an attack of <lb/>
spinal weakness, which compelled her to spend most <lb/>
of her time lying upon a couch.</p>
<pb n="129" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0140"/>
<p>It was at this period that, turning from the usual <lb/>
studies of girls of her age, Catherine devoted her <lb/>
enforced leisure to reading books dealing with Church <lb/>
history and theology. Wesley, Finney, Fletcher, <lb/>
Mosheim, and Neander followed closely on her <reg orig="fav-|ourite">favourite</reg> <lb/>
"Butler's Analogy" and "Pilgrim's Progress." <lb/>
She also carefully perused "Newton on Prophecy," <lb/>
coming to the conclusion with respect to the latter <lb/>
that she could better please God by preparing people <lb/>
for Christ's coming than by endeavouring to fix the <lb/>
date when it was to take place.</p>
<p>Miss Mumford seems to have been in every respect <lb/>
more early developed than the average girl, for she <lb/>
was only fifteen when there devolved upon her the <lb/>
serious responsibility of accepting or rejecting a <lb/>
would-be lover!</p>
<p>This young man, who was her cousin, was not <lb/>
without attractions, but his obviously worldly and <lb/>
irreligious character finally decided her to break off <lb/>
all correspondence with him, a step which she never <lb/>
afterwards had cause to regret.</p>

<div2 type="chapter" n="II" id="d30">
<head><hi rend="bold">CHAPTER II. <lb/>
CONVERSION AND CONSECRATION.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">In</hi>1844 the Mumfords removed to London, and <lb/>
at length took up their residence at Brixton; <lb/>
here, not many months after her arrival, occurred <lb/>
what we may assuredly call the most important event <lb/>
of Catherine's life, namely, her conversion.</p>
<p>In accordance with the views of the religious body <lb/>
<pb n="130" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0141"/>
among whom she had been nurtured, the girl felt that <lb/>
some definite inward convulsion invariably <reg orig="accom-|panied">accompanied</reg> <lb/>
true change of heart, and this she was not <lb/>
aware as yet of having experienced. Therefore, <reg orig="al-|though">although</reg>, <lb/>
as she says, "I was conscious of having given <lb/>
myself up fully to God from my earliest years, and <lb/>
although I was anxious to serve Him and often <lb/>
realised deep enjoyment in prayer, nevertheless, I <lb/>
had not the positive assurance that my sins were <lb/>
forgiven."</p>
<p>The poor child, struggling for peace, passed through <lb/>
weeks of mental agony, often pacing her room until <lb/>
two o'clock in the morning, and when, utterly <reg orig="ex-|hausted">exhausted</reg>, <lb/>
she at length lay down to sleep, she would <lb/>
place her Bible and hymn-book under her pillow, <lb/>
praying that she might wake up with the assurance <lb/>
of salvation.</p>
<p>At length, one morning, when she opened her <lb/>
hymn-book, her eyes fell upon the words:&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l rend="indent">"My God, I am Thine!</l>
<l rend="indent">What a comfort Divine,&mdash;</l>
<l>What a blessing to know that my Jesus is mine."</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>Instantly, familiar as the lines had been before, <lb/>
they seemed invested with a new meaning; the <reg orig="long-|sought">long-sought</reg> <lb/>
"assurance of salvation" rushed in upon her <lb/>
soul like a flood, and, overwhelmed with joy, Catherine <lb/>
jumped out of bed and at once ran into her mother's <lb/>
room to tell the good news to her.</p>
<p>It was no doubt a remembrance of this episode <lb/>
which led Mrs. Booth in after years to insist so <lb/>
strongly on the possibility of immediate acceptance <lb/>
and instant salvation and joy, which was so marked a <lb/>
feature of her own ministrations to inquiring souls.</p>
<pb n="131" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0142"/>
<p>"For the next six months," she wrote, "I was so <lb/>
happy that I felt as if I were walking on air. I used <lb/>
to tremble, and even long to die, lest I should <reg orig="back-|slide">backslide</reg>, <lb/>
or lose the consciousness of God's smile and <lb/>
favour."</p>
<p>Catherine now joined the Wesleyan Church at <lb/>
Brixton; but although the Society had in London <lb/>
at that time some of its most able and eloquent <lb/>
preachers&mdash;the eminent Luke Tyerman being one of <lb/>
them&mdash;the young convert and her mother were not <lb/>
satisfied, because the services were unaccompanied by <lb/>
those unmistakable outward manifestations of <reg orig="re-|pentance">repentance</reg> <lb/>
and salvation which they deemed essential <lb/>
proofs of the work of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Of course Catherine's next step was to begin <lb/>
attending a class-meeting, much more stringently <lb/>
required of members of the Wesleyan body fifty years <lb/>
ago than now, and looked upon, indeed, as a <foreign lang="spa"><hi rend="italic">sine qu&acirc; <lb/>
non</hi></foreign> of the Christian life. This class she continued to <lb/>
attend for the next five years. Here she received <lb/>
her most valuable training in the art of speaking in <lb/>
public. For, whatever opinion we may entertain as <lb/>
to the desirability of forcing a young girl to pray <lb/>
aloud, and even keeping the rest of the class upon <lb/>
their knees for five minutes waiting for her to begin, <lb/>
when she was in such delicate health that the <reg orig="excite-|ment">excitement</reg> <lb/>
and exertion were making her ill, there is no <lb/>
doubt that to this rigorous discipline was owing much <lb/>
of Mrs. Booth's fluency and power in after life.</p>
<p>But although this experience was no hindrance to <lb/>
the young enthusiast, the fact that her class-leader's <lb/>
daughter was allowed to dress in accordance with the <lb/>
fashions of the world and become engaged to an <lb/>
<pb n="132" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0143"/>
unconverted young man, caused her the utmost sorrow <lb/>
and concern; for she feared that while such <reg orig="incon-|sistencies">inconsistencies</reg> <lb/>
were tolerated, little permanent good could <lb/>
be accomplished among members of the class.</p>
<p>Like many thoughtful Christians in the leisured <lb/>
days gone by, Catherine Mumford found pleasure in <lb/>
recording her religious symptoms and advancement. <lb/>
Thus in her eighteenth and nineteenth years we find <lb/>
such occasional entries in her diary as the following, <lb/>
written at Brighton, where she was staying for the <lb/>
benefit of her health:&mdash;</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">14th May</hi>, 1847.&mdash;This morning, while reading <lb/>
Rowe's 'Devout Exercises of the Heart,' I was much <lb/>
blessed, and enabled to give myself afresh into the <lb/>
hands of God, to do or to suffer all His will. Oh, <lb/>
that I may be made useful in this family! Lord, <lb/>
they know Thee not, neither do they seek Thee! <lb/>
Have mercy upon them, and help me to set an <reg orig="ex-|ample">example</reg>, <lb/>
at all times and in all places, worthy of <reg orig="imita-|tion">imitation</reg>. <lb/>
Help me to adorn the Gospel of God, my <lb/>
Saviour, in all things.</p>
<p>"I find much need of watchfulness and prayer, and <lb/>
have this day taken up my cross in reproving sin. <lb/>
Lord, follow with the conviction of Thy Spirit all I <lb/>
have said."</p>
<p>And again, on 28th November, she writes:&mdash;"This <lb/>
has been an especially good day to my soul. &hellip; My <lb/>
desires after holiness have been much increased. This <lb/>
day I have sometimes seemed on the verge of the <lb/>
good land. Oh, for mighty faith! I believe the <lb/>
Lord is willing and able to save me to the uttermost. <lb/>
I believe the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses from all <lb/>
sin. And yet there seems something in the way to <lb/>
<pb n="133" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0144"/>
prevent me from fully entering in. But to-day I <lb/>
believe at times I have had tastes of perfect love. <lb/>
Oh, that these may be droppings before an <reg orig="over-|whelming">overwhelming</reg> <lb/>
shower of grace! My chief desire is <reg orig="holi-|ness">holiness</reg> <lb/>
of heart. This is the prevailing cry of my soul."</p>
<p>At the beginning of the New Year &lpar;1848&rpar;, she has <lb/>
the following entry:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I have been writing a few daily rules for the <lb/>
coming year, which I hope will prove a blessing to me <lb/>
by the grace of God. &hellip; I have read my Bible <lb/>
through twice during the last sixteen months, but I <lb/>
must read it with more prayer for light and <reg orig="under-|standing">understanding</reg>. <lb/>
Oh, may it be my meat and drink! May <lb/>
I meditate on it day and night! and then I shall bring <lb/>
forth fruit in season, my leaf also shall not wither, and <lb/>
whatsoever I do shall prosper!"</p>
<p>A few days later we have a record which, <reg orig="consider-|ing">considering</reg> <lb/>
that shortly before the writer had owned to <lb/>
feeling "very poorly, and excessively low," does more <lb/>
credit to her zeal than her discretion:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I have renewed my practice of abstaining from <lb/>
dinner on a Friday, and from butter in the morning. <lb/>
&hellip; Oh, my Lord, help me to be more fully decided <lb/>
in all things, and not to confer with flesh and blood, <lb/>
but be bold to take up and firm to sustain the <reg orig="con-|secrated">consecrated</reg> <lb/>
cross."</p>
<p>It was about this time that a great agitation arose <lb/>
in the Wesleyan community, leading ultimately to <lb/>
the withdrawal or expulsion of about one hundred <lb/>
thousand of its members.</p>
<p>Briefly, the autocratic government of the hundred <lb/>
ministers, who in accordance with John Wesley's Deed <lb/>
Poll formed the Conference, aroused feelings of <reg orig="rebel-|lion">rebellion</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="134" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0145"/>
in the minds of certain of their brethren who were <lb/>
not thus in office. Anonymous pamphlets were <reg orig="pub-|lished">published</reg>, <lb/>
purporting to expose serious errors in the <lb/>
administration. These naturally gave great offence <lb/>
to the Conference, who endeavoured to fix upon the <lb/>
masked offenders, with the result that three ministers <lb/>
were expelled from the society, and a number of others <lb/>
severely reprimanded.</p>
<p>The numbers of malcontents, however, were <reg orig="in-|creased">increased</reg> <lb/>
rather than diminished by those stringent <lb/>
measures, and in a short time they had formed <reg orig="them-|selves">themselves</reg> <lb/>
into a body, subsequently known as the <lb/>
Reformers, and thousands of their sympathisers were <lb/>
virtually excommunicated by the Conference.</p>
<p>Miss Mumford was ever inclined to be on the side <lb/>
of the people, and those who seemed to be oppressed. <lb/>
Possessing from her earliest years, as we have seen, <lb/>
the courage of her convictions, she so boldly expressed <lb/>
her opinions on this subject as to draw upon herself <lb/>
the censure of her conservative-minded class-leader, <lb/>
who finding her firm in her sympathy with those whom <lb/>
she believed to be in the right, reluctantly decided to <lb/>
withhold her ticket of membership. In other words, <lb/>
Catherine Mumford was expelled from the Wesleyan <lb/>
Church.</p>
<p>The Reformers had by this time commenced to <lb/>
hold meetings in the neighbourhood of Catherine's <lb/>
home, and when she was offered by them the senior <lb/>
class in their Sunday School, she willingly accepted <lb/>
the post, and threw herself into the work with all her <lb/>
heart.</p>
<p>"I used to have some wonderful times with my <lb/>
class," she tells us. "I made them pray, and I am <lb/>
<pb n="135" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0146"/>
sure that anybody coming into one of those meetings <lb/>
would have seen very much what a Salvation Army <lb/>
consecration meeting is now. They usually all <lb/>
stopped, and sometimes our prayer-meetings would <lb/>
last an hour and a half. Often went on till I lost <lb/>
my voice, not regaining it for a day or two after. <lb/>
I used to invite them to talk to me privately, if <reg orig="any-|thing">anything</reg> <lb/>
I said had struck them, and at such times they <lb/>
would pour out their hearts to me as if I had been <lb/>
their mother.</p>
<p>"However, I was a good deal disappointed with the <lb/>
Reformers. I had hoped that we were upon the eve <lb/>
of a great spiritual revival. Instead of this, <reg orig="every-|thing">everything</reg> <lb/>
was conducted very much in the ordinary style, <lb/>
and I soon became heartily sick of the spirit of debate <lb/>
and controversy which prevailed to such a degree as <lb/>
to cripple the life and power of the concern."</p>

<head><hi rend="bold">CHAPTER III <lb/>
COURTSHIP, MARRIAGE, AND MATERNITY.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">It</hi> was in the autumn of 1851 that amongst the <lb/>
local preachers chosen to fill in turn the pulpit of <lb/>
the Reformers' Chapel which Miss Mumford and her <lb/>
mother now attended, occurred the name of a certain <lb/>
Mr. William Booth.</p>
<p>This young man, who, reared in the Church of <lb/>
England, had received his first definite religious <reg orig="im-|pressions">impressions</reg> <lb/>
at a Wesleyan Chapel, had from boyhood <lb/>
been in the habit of holding cottage meetings and <lb/>
visiting the sick and dying. He also delighted in <lb/>
<pb n="136" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0147"/>
assisting at open-air services, the object of which was <lb/>
to draw the unthinking to attendance at Divine <lb/>
worship.</p>
<p>Mr. Booth's great desire was to be a preacher, and <lb/>
he offered himself for that purpose to the Wesleyan <lb/>
Connexion, but was rather coldly received.</p>
<p>He then devoted his overflowing energies to <reg orig="open-|air">open-air</reg> <lb/>
work in the streets and greens of Kennington, but <lb/>
although he had. so far, held himself aloof from the <lb/>
Reformers, he became suspected by the minister in <lb/>
charge of his circuit with bring tainted with their <lb/>
heresy, and, like Catherine Mumford, but with less <lb/>
justification, he too was summarily expelled.</p>
<p>As soon, however, as the Reformers heard of this, <lb/>
they cordially invited him to join their ranks; he <lb/>
acceded to their request, and thus found himself in <lb/>
the pulpit of Binfield House Chapel.</p>
<p>Miss Mumford was present on the occasion that he <lb/>
preached, and was very much impressed with both <lb/>
Mr. Booth and his sermon.</p>
<p>Asked her opinion of the latter a few days later by <lb/>
Mr. Rabbits, one of the leading men connected with <lb/>
the chapel, she replied that she considered it the best <lb/>
sermon she had yet heard at Binfield Hall.</p>
<p>Shortly afterwards Mr. Rabbits invited the principal <lb/>
Reformers of that district to tea at his house, and <lb/>
social intercourse. Mrs. and Miss Mumford were <lb/>
among the guests, and also William Booth.</p>
<p>The latter, who was a clever elocutionist, was <lb/>
pressed, in the course of the evening, to give a striking <lb/>
temperance recitation, entitled "The Grog Seller's <lb/>
Dream." This in its turn gave rise to conversation <lb/>
on the subject of Total Abstinence, drawing from <lb/>
<pb n="137" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0148"/>
Miss Mumford some convincing expressions of her <lb/>
own strong views in favour of the movement, and <lb/>
revealing the fact that on some important points she <lb/>
and the young preacher were wholly in sympathy.</p>
<p>Early in 1852, William Booth relinquished business <lb/>
and gave himself up wholly to the work of the <lb/>
ministry. The Reformers had appointed him their <lb/>
pastor, and he commenced his labours on a salary of <lb/>
fifty pounds a-year.</p>
<p>The acquaintance between him and Catherine <lb/>
Mumford soon developed into friendship, which ere <lb/>
long ripened into a warmer feeling on both sides. <lb/>
But realising that his position and income were <lb/>
Somewhat insecure, Mr. Booth shrank for some time <lb/>
from asking the young lady to enter into a definite <lb/>
engagement.</p>
<p>Catherine, on her part, behaved as unselfishly and <lb/>
disinterestedly as did her lover, begging him only to <lb/>
make sure that every step he took was in accordance <lb/>
with the will of God.</p>
<p>But in May of that year both were eventually <lb/>
brought to see that it would be with the blessing of <lb/>
God and for the furtherance of His work that two <lb/>
Whose deepest longings and dearest aims were <reg orig="identi-|cal">identical</reg>, <lb/>
should become one; and the betrothal was <lb/>
sealed.</p>
<p>The love-letters that were subsequently exchanged <lb/>
between this remarkable couple are as far removed <lb/>
from earthliness&mdash;those of the young lady especially <lb/>
so&mdash;as were the minds and aspirations of the writers.</p>
<p>Not many recently-engaged girls, we venture to <lb/>
think, would write to her beloved in such a strain as <lb/>
this:&mdash;</p>
<pb n="138" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0149"/>
<p>"<hi rend="small-caps">My dear William</hi>,&mdash;I ought to be happy after <lb/>
enjoying your company all the evening, but now <lb/>
you are gone and I am alone, I feel a regret consonant <lb/>
with the height of my enjoyment. How wide the <lb/>
difference between heavenly and earthly joys! The <lb/>
former satiate the soul and reproduce themselves. <lb/>
The latter, after planting in our soul the seeds of <lb/>
future griefs and cares, take their flight and leave an <lb/>
aching void.</p>
<p>"How wisely God has apportioned our cup! He <lb/>
does not give us all sweetness, lest we should rest <lb/>
satisfied with earth; nor all bitterness, lest we grow <lb/>
weary and disgusted with our lot. But He wisely <lb/>
mixes the two, so that if we drink the one, we must also <lb/>
taste the other. And perhaps a time is coming when <lb/>
we shall see that the proportions of this cup of human <lb/>
joy and sorrow are more equally adjusted than we <lb/>
now imagine&mdash;that souls capable of enjoyments above <lb/>
the vulgar crowd can also feel sorrow, in comparison <lb/>
with which theirs is but like the passing April cloud <lb/>
in contrast with the long Egyptian night.</p>
<p>"How wise an ordination this is we cannot now <lb/>
discover. It will require the light which streams from <lb/>
the Eternal Throne to reveal to us the blessed effects <lb/>
of having the sentence of death written on all our <lb/>
earthly enjoyments. I often anticipate the glorious <lb/>
employment of investigating the mysterious workings <lb/>
of Divine Providence. Oh, may it be our happy lot <lb/>
to assist each other in these heavenly researches in <lb/>
that pure, bright world above!"</p>
<p>After this, it is almost refreshing to find one record <lb/>
of natural girlishness. In later life Mrs. Booth <reg orig="con-|fessed">confessed</reg> <lb/>
that "I had, like most people, certain <reg orig="prefer-|ences">preferences</reg>. <lb/>
<pb n="139" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0150"/>
The first was that the object of my choice <lb/>
should be a minister.&hellip; Then I very much desired <lb/>
that he should be dark and tall, and had a special <lb/>
liking for the name of 'William.' Singularly enough, <lb/>
in adhering to my essentials, my fancies were also <lb/>
gratified, and in my case the promise was certainly <lb/>
fulfilled, 'Delight thyself in the Lord, and He shall <lb/>
give thee the desires of thy heart.'"</p>
<p>Mrs. Booth's views on the subject of courtship and <lb/>
marriage, formulated when the force of her strong <lb/>
character in its maturity had burst the bonds of that <lb/>
stilted religiosity of language which, to some minds, <lb/>
may mar the compositions of her early years, are so <lb/>
wise and practical that they may well be quoted <lb/>
here; would that we had space to give her words <lb/>
in full.</p>
<p>"Who can wonder," she remarks, "that marriage <lb/>
is so often a failure, when we observe the ridiculous <lb/>
way in which courtship is commonly carried on?&hellip;</p>
<p>"Perhaps the greatest evil of all is <hi rend="italic">hurry</hi>. Young <lb/>
people do not give themselves time to know each <lb/>
other before an engagement is formed. They should <lb/>
take time and make opportunities for acquainting <lb/>
themselves with each other's character, disposition, <lb/>
and peculiarities before coming to a decision.&hellip;</p>
<p>"As quite a young girl I early made up my mind <lb/>
to certain qualifications which I regarded as <reg orig="indis-|pensable">indispensable</reg> <lb/>
to the forming of any engagement.</p>
<p>"In the first place I was determined that his <lb/>
religious views <hi rend="italic">must</hi> coincide with mine. He must <lb/>
be a sincere Christian, not a nominal one, or a mere <lb/>
Church member, but truly converted to God.&hellip; <lb/>
Thousands of Christians, women especially, have <lb/>
<pb n="140" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0151"/>
proved by bitter experience that neither money, <lb/>
position, nor any other worldly advantage has availed <lb/>
to prevent the punishment that invariably attends <lb/>
disobedience to the command, 'Be not unequally <lb/>
yoked together with unbelievers.'</p>
<p>"The second essential that I resolved upon was that <lb/>
he should be a man of sense. I knew that I could <lb/>
never respect a fool, or one much weaker mentally <lb/>
than myself. &hellip; There ought to be similarity or <lb/>
congeniality of <hi rend="italic">character</hi> as well as of grace.&hellip;</p>
<p>"The third essential consisted of oneness of views <lb/>
and tastes, any idea of lordship or ownership being <lb/>
lost in love. &hellip; Of course, there must and will be <lb/>
it is a pleasure and a joy to yield our own wills to <lb/>
those for whom we have real affection, whenever it <lb/>
can be done with an approving conscience. &hellip;</p>
<p>"Another resolution I made was that I would <lb/>
never marry a man who was not a total abstainer, <lb/>
and this from conviction, and not merely in order <lb/>
to gratify me."</p>
<p>Having, therefore, been so happy as to find her <lb/>
every requirement fulfilled in the man who loved <lb/>
her, Catherine Mumford, on the 16th of June, 1855, <lb/>
became Mrs. William Booth.</p>
<p>Her bridegroom, who for some months previously <lb/>
had been conducting evangelistic services in various <lb/>
parts of the country with marked success, was now <lb/>
appointed by the Annual Conference of the New <lb/>
Connexion to the permanent work of itinerant <lb/>
missions, or "revivals," as they were formerly called.</p>
<p>It was a keen disappointment to both that <lb/>
Catherine's health, always delicate, forbade her at <lb/>
<pb n="141" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0152"/>
first to accompany Mr. Booth on these journeys, and <lb/>
the letters which passed between them while separated <lb/>
were of a tenderly affectionate tone. Very soon, <lb/>
however, she was able to join him, and an extract <lb/>
or two from a letter she wrote to him during a brief <lb/>
absence shortly after, indicates that her nature was <lb/>
already expanding in the sunshine of love and joy, <lb/>
and coming out of its chrysalis bondage like a <reg orig="butter-|fly">butterfly</reg> <lb/>
in spring.</p>
<p>"Here I sit under a hedge in the beautiful lane <lb/>
you pointed out to me. It is one of the loveliest days <lb/>
old earth has ever basked in.&hellip; All Nature seems <lb/>
to be exulting in existence, and your moralising little <lb/>
wife is much better in health and in a mood to enjoy <lb/>
all these beauties and advantages to the utmost. &hellip; <lb/>
I feel perfectly at home here, and experience just <lb/>
that free, sweet, wholesome kind of atmosphere which <lb/>
I have so long been panting for. My natural spirits <lb/>
are in a high key this morning. I feel as if I could <lb/>
get over a stile just at hand and join the lambs in <lb/>
their gambols." &lpar;!&rpar;</p>
<p>For nearly a year this truly happy and united <lb/>
pair traveled from town to town together, one in <lb/>
heart, in work, in all their hopes and joys. Many <lb/>
converts were gathered in, and the constant testimony <lb/>
of husband and wife was to ever-increasing love for <lb/>
and delight in each other.</p>
<p>A visit to Halifax in March, 1856, was prolonged <lb/>
by the arrival of "a plump, round-faced, dark-<reg orig="com-|plexioned">complexioned</reg>, <lb/>
black-pated" little person, since known to <lb/>
the world as William Bramwell Booth, Chief of the <lb/>
Staff of the Salvation Army.</p>
<p>Concerning her first-born son, Mrs. Booth writes:&mdash; <lb/>
<pb n="142" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0153"/>
"I held him up to God as soon as I had strength to <lb/>
do so, and I remember specially desiring that he <lb/>
should be an advocate of holiness. &hellip; At an early <lb/>
age he manifested signs of intelligence and ability. <lb/>
He resembled me especially in one particular, that <lb/>
was in taking upon himself responsibility. He was <lb/>
very conscientious too. &hellip; I cannot remember his <lb/>
ever telling me a falsehood. &hellip; His energy as a child <lb/>
was something marvellous."</p>
<p>Shortly after this event, Mr. Booth, at the wish of <lb/>
the Conference, was induced for a while to relinquish <lb/>
evangelistic work, and settle down in a circuit. <lb/>
Brighouse in Yorkshire was the appointed scene of <lb/>
his labours, and here the family remained about a <lb/>
year. It was at Brighouse that their second son, <lb/>
Ballington, was born. This was almost the only <lb/>
pleasant event of that period, as Mr. Booth felt that <lb/>
he had been unfairly dealt with by the Conference, <lb/>
and that his special talent was being stifled. And <lb/>
we need not say that his wife fully shared all his <lb/>
views.</p>
<p>In May, 1858, William Booth received the rite of <lb/>
ordination, and the consequent privilege of what is <lb/>
termed "full connexion;" and although still hoping <lb/>
and longing to return to the more congenial <reg orig="evangel-|istic">evangelistic</reg> <lb/>
sphere, he consented to another year's circuit <lb/>
work, this time at Gateshead.</p>
<p>Here the enthusiastic pair found themselves in <lb/>
happier conditions. The very first Sunday night <lb/>
they were there "six persons professed salvation, and <lb/>
the occasion was made the more interesting by what <lb/>
was then an unheard of novelty, the minister's wife <lb/>
leading off in prayer at the conclusion of the sermon," <lb/>
<pb n="143" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0154"/>
which appears to have been Mrs. Booth's first <reg orig="appear-|ance">appearance</reg> <lb/>
in anything like a ministerial capacity in public.</p>
<p>Before long, the new pastor was drawing crowded <lb/>
congregations, and the chapel had gained the <reg orig="sobri-|quet">sobriquet</reg> <lb/>
of the "Converting Shop." It was here that he <lb/>
first began to gain influence over the masses.</p>
<p>At Gateshead, in September, 1858, the Booths' first <lb/>
little daughter, Catherine, was born. She is now Mrs. <lb/>
Booth-Clibborn, otherwise the "Mar&eacute;chale."</p>
<p>Some very successful "revival" work was done at <lb/>
Gateshead, the methods of Mr. Booth as time went on <lb/>
inclining more and more to the since well-known <lb/>
"Salvation" type, "all-day prayer meetings," open air <lb/>
processions, etc., being inaugurated. It was here also <lb/>
that Mrs. Booth first gained courage to visit the poor <lb/>
in their own homes, and urge them to attend the <lb/>
mission services, and she was especially blessed in her <lb/>
endeavours to reclaim drunkards. When the <reg orig="stipu-|lated">stipulated</reg> <lb/>
twelve months at Gateshead had expired, <lb/>
Mr. Booth was again persuaded to stay on as a <lb/>
circuit minister instead of returning to his loved <lb/>
work of itinerant evangelist.</p>
<p>In December, 1859, Mrs. Booth's attention was <lb/>
drawn to a pamphlet written by a Mr. Rees, attacking <lb/>
on Scriptural grounds the right of women to preach. <lb/>
The exciting cause of this publication being the visit <lb/>
of an American evangelist and his wife, Dr. and <lb/>
Mrs. Palmer, the latter of whom took the more <lb/>
prominent part in the meetings. Mrs. Booth was <lb/>
highly indignant at this opposition, and was moved <lb/>
to write a powerful and convincing pamphlet in reply.</p>
<p>This was the commencement of the life-long <reg orig="war-|fare">warfare</reg> <lb/>
which she subsequently waged against the <reg orig="con-|ventionality">conventionality</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="144" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0155"/>
that would forbid women the opportunity <lb/>
of teaching in the church.</p>
<p>A good deal of interesting correspondence with <lb/>
various people was evoked by the publication of <lb/>
Mrs. Booth's protest, but it was not until after the <lb/>
birth of her fourth child, Emma Moss Booth &lpar;Mrs. <lb/>
Booth-Tucker&rpar; that she was able to champion in her <lb/>
own person and by her example, the right of women <lb/>
to speak as the Spirit gives them utterance.</p>

THE MOTHER OF THE SALVATION ARMY.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">It</hi> was in the spring of 1860 that Mrs. Booth made <lb/>
her first appearance in her husband's pulpit.</p>
<p>Although she had for months been exercised in <lb/>
mind on the subject, her action at last, after much <lb/>
inward conflict and reluctance, was unpremeditated.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of one of Mr. Booth's services, she <lb/>
suddenly rose, walked up the aisle, and told her <lb/>
husband she wanted "to say a word."</p>
<p>Overcome by surprise and pleasure&mdash;for this was <lb/>
what he had long been vainly trying to persuade her <lb/>
to do&mdash;Mr. Booth could only say, "My dear wife <lb/>
wishes to speak," and then sat down.</p>
<p>Then Mrs. Booth "just stood and told the people <lb/>
how it had come about." She said she realised that <lb/>
she had long, by her silence, been disobeying God, <lb/>
and was resolved to do so no more.</p>
<p>The congregation were deeply affected; "many <lb/>
dated a renewal in righteousness from that very <lb/>
<pb n="145" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0156"/>
moment, and began a life of devotion and <reg orig="consecra-|tion">consecration</reg> <lb/>
to God."</p>
<p>Yielding to her husband's entreaties, Mrs. Booth <lb/>
consented, on the evening of the same day, to preach <lb/>
a regular sermon.</p>
<p>Her text on this memorable occasion was, "Be filled <lb/>
with the Spirit." The chapel was crowded to the <lb/>
very window sills, and much blessing was received.</p>
<p>From this time forward Mrs. Booth's fame as a <lb/>
preacher continued to spread far and wide. During <lb/>
her husband's enforced absence for rest in September <lb/>
of that same year, she undertook all his most <reg orig="import-|ant">important</reg> <lb/>
services, and her letters of that period speak <lb/>
enthusiastically of full congregations, blessed times, <lb/>
and encouraging cases of conversion.</p>
<p>The following year the subject of personal holiness <lb/>
was much borne in upon Mrs. Booth's mind, and <lb/>
became a marked feature of her subsequent teachings. <lb/>
In this connection one cannot but express the regret <lb/>
which is called forth repeatedly during the writing of <lb/>
this memoir, that the fervid intensity of Mrs. Booth's <lb/>
religious convictions should not have escaped the <lb/>
narrowness and intolerance which too often mars <lb/>
piety of this type. Her sweeping condemnation of all <lb/>
who did not think it necessary to advertise their <lb/>
Christian profession by startling peculiarities in dress, <lb/>
and her wholesale charges of coldness, hardness and <lb/>
formality against those whose joy and peace in <reg orig="believ-|ing">believing</reg> <lb/>
were unaccompanied by moral earthquakes and <lb/>
tornadoes, were certainly "flies in the ointment" of <lb/>
an otherwise admirable character.</p>
<p>The Booths remained at Gateshead until 1861, when, <lb/>
after much controversy with the Conference, into <lb/>
<pb n="146" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0157"/>
which we have not space to enter here, Mr. Booth <lb/>
finally tendered his resignation and gave himself up <lb/>
to the revival work which was at once his delight and <lb/>
his <hi rend="italic">forte</hi>.</p>
<p>From that time forward, the conducting of missions <lb/>
in various parts of the country became the life-work <lb/>
of this devoted pair. Cornwall, Cardiff, Walsall, <lb/>
Birmingham, and other places became in turn the <lb/>
scene of their united efforts, and everywhere we find <lb/>
the same record of "blessed seasons," "great liberty <lb/>
of speech," weeping penitents and rejoicing converts. <lb/>
Herbert Booth, the future musician of the Salvation <lb/>
Army, was born at Penzance in 1862.</p>
<p>At Walsall Mrs. Booth experienced the joy of <lb/>
receiving her own son, Bramwell, aged about eight, at <lb/>
the juvenile penitent form. About a year previously <lb/>
he had definitely refused the offer of salvation, so the <lb/>
mother's thankfulness was now proportionately great.</p>
<p>In May, 1864, the sixth child, Marian, was born, <lb/>
the first who seems in any way to have inherited that <lb/>
delicate physical health against which Mrs. Booth's <lb/>
dauntless spirit was doomed so continually to <lb/>
struggle.</p>
<p>It was after her recovery from this illness that the <lb/>
woman-evangelist first decided to conduct meetings <lb/>
unassisted by her husband, and thus double their <lb/>
power for good.</p>
<p>At Batley, Pudsey, and Wood house Carr she <reg orig="con-|ducted">conducted</reg> <lb/>
revival services with great success. At one of <lb/>
these places in the course of <hi rend="italic">six days</hi>, over <hi rend="italic">one hundred <lb/>
adults</hi> and <hi rend="italic">two hundred children</hi> came forward as <lb/>
penitents to the communion rail.</p>
<p>In 1865, Mr. and Mrs. Booth took up their abode <lb/>
<pb n="147" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0158"/>
in London, and here, in a marquee in the Quaker <lb/>
burial-ground at Whitechapel, the great Salvation <lb/>
Army may be said to have had its birth.</p>
<p>Into this big tent were gathered, night after night, <lb/>
the poorest and vilest of the outcasts of the great city, <lb/>
and at meeting after meeting tears of penitence were <lb/>
shed, and new lives begun. But while William Booth <lb/>
felt his sympathies go out especially to those of the <lb/>
most wretched classes, his wife's ministry seemed <lb/>
peculiarly acceptable to those of superior social <lb/>
position, and even when she spoke most plainly <lb/>
respecting society sins, denouncing the selfishness of <lb/>
fashion, the cruelty of stag-hunting, or the brutality <lb/>
of war in scathing terms, the long line of carriages <lb/>
waiting outside the hall in which her addresses were <lb/>
delivered, testified that her frankness attracted rather <lb/>
than repelled those whom she was desirous to <reg orig="influ-|ence">influence</reg>. <lb/>
As her biographer remarks, "it was a singular <lb/>
coincidence that at the very time when Mr. Booth was <lb/>
commencing his East End campaign, Mrs. Booth was <lb/>
conducting her first West End services, so that the <lb/>
very antipodes of London society were simultaneously <lb/>
assailed." And Mrs. Booth's impassioned appeals to <lb/>
the rich were often the means of obtaining money <lb/>
wherewith to continue the evangelising work among <lb/>
the poor. Surely no husband and wife were ever <lb/>
more truly united, or exemplified more beautifully <lb/>
the law of mutual complement than did William and <lb/>
Catherine Booth!</p>
<p>Ultimately "the General," as we must now call <lb/>
him, decided to abandon itinerant mission work, and <lb/>
devote himself wholly to the East End poor. In this <lb/>
determination he met with a staunch ally and <reg orig="gener-|ous">generous</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="148" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0159"/>
supporter in Mr. Samuel Morley, M.P., who once <lb/>
described himself at a Salvation Army meeting as a <lb/>
"sleeping partner" in the concern.</p>
<p>When the tent in the burial-ground was blown <lb/>
down in a gale, a dancing saloon was secured, in <lb/>
which the services could be held; and the East <lb/>
London Mission, as for a time it was called, grew and <lb/>
flourished.</p>
<p>On Christmas Day, 1865, a seventh child &lpar;being the <lb/>
fourth daughter&rpar; was added to the Booth family, and <lb/>
received the appropriate name of Evangeline.</p>
<p>Again and again was Mrs. Booth prostrated by <lb/>
weakness and maladies of various forms, and as often, <lb/>
in answer to fervent prayer, was she restored to <reg orig="com-|parative">comparative</reg> <lb/>
health and the ability to continue her work. <lb/>
But her whole life was a chronic martyrdom of bodily <lb/>
suffering, such as only the strongest spirit, upborne <lb/>
by a constant sense of Divine help, could have <reg orig="sus-|tained">sustained</reg>.</p>
<p>On the 28th of April, 1867, was born the eighth and <lb/>
last child, another girl, who was named Lucy Milward. <lb/>
Like her sister, Marian, she has been of a delicate <lb/>
constitution, and while others worked and fought, it <lb/>
has been her lot to be among those who "also serve," <lb/>
though they may only "stand and wait."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the older children were all following in <lb/>
the steps of their father and mother, holding little <lb/>
meetings among themselves and their young <reg orig="com-|panions">companions</reg> <lb/>
at a very early age. Their letters to their <lb/>
parents on various occasions of separation teem with <lb/>
expressions of religious fervour, and record efforts <lb/>
made for the spiritual enlightenment and moral <lb/>
restoration of those with whom they were thrown <lb/>
<pb n="149" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0160"/>
Their self-examination and contemplation also <lb/>
resembled that of their mother in her youth, and their <lb/>
fluctuations of religious feeling were carefully noted <lb/>
down at an age when most children are absorbed in <lb/>
their lessons and play. This complete reproduction, <lb/>
in each and all, of the parental characteristics, was <lb/>
probably the result of Mrs. Booth's carefulness in <lb/>
Keeping them as much as possible from any <reg orig="associa-|tion">association</reg> <lb/>
with persons, either old or young, of a different <lb/>
type, until her own views were stamped indelibly upon <lb/>
their plastic souls.</p>
<p>Ever busy as Mrs. Booth always was with her <reg orig="im-|portant">important</reg> <lb/>
mission of converting the lost, she never <lb/>
allowed that to betray her into neglect of nearer <lb/>
duties. Her children's welfare, both bodily and <lb/>
spiritual, was her constant care. She prayed and <lb/>
laboured that they might be true Christians and <lb/>
earnestly devoted to the work of saving souls; the <lb/>
remarkable manner in which this, her dearest wish, <lb/>
has been fulfilled, is sufficient evidence that she <lb/>
sought its furtherance in the best way.</p>
<p>Complete severance from what she regarded as <lb/>
"the world," was ever a cardinal point in Mrs. Booth's <lb/>
principles, and she naturally enforced it upon her <lb/>
family, as it was afterwards made a leading feature <lb/>
in the discipline of the Salvation Army. Even the <lb/>
beautiful frocks, etc., which the children's <reg orig="grand-|mother">grandmother</reg> <lb/>
made for them with her own hands, were <lb/>
stripped of all superfluous ornamentation before they <lb/>
were permitted to be worn.</p>
<p>In December, 1869, Mrs. Booth experienced a heavy <lb/>
sorrow in the death of Mrs. Mumford, after a period <lb/>
of intense suffering. The devoted daughter had <reg orig="per-|suaded">persuaded</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="150" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0161"/>
her mother some months earlier, when it was <lb/>
known that the disease which had attacked the latter <lb/>
must be fatal, to come up to London and live near her, <lb/>
so the two had the mutual comfort of being together <lb/>
when the end came, and Mrs. Mumford's happy and <lb/>
glorious departure was the greatest possible solace <lb/>
to Mrs. Booth.</p>
<p>In 1870, the People's Market in Whitechapel Road <lb/>
was purchased, and here "<hi rend="italic">All-Nights of Prayer</hi>" were <lb/>
first conducted by Mrs. Booth; and here also the <lb/>
East London Mission tried its earliest experiment in <lb/>
the sale of cheap food to the poor.</p>
<p>In 1872, the General broke down under the strain <lb/>
of his prolonged exertions, and was completely laid <lb/>
aside for six months. During his illness and <reg orig="en-|forced">enforced</reg> <lb/>
absence, Mrs. Booth managed the affairs of <lb/>
the Mission with ability and success. On the return <lb/>
of her husband she arranged what proved to be one <lb/>
of her most successful campaigns she ever undertook <lb/>
&mdash;that of Portsmouth, in 1873.</p>
<p>She engaged a music hall in the lowest part of <lb/>
the town and gathered immense crowds of soldiers <lb/>
and sailors, their companions, and "the worst and <lb/>
most Gospel-needy classes in the town." The services <lb/>
lasted seventeen weeks, and the names of six hundred <lb/>
converts were taken. The morning meetings on this <lb/>
memorable occasion were devoted to professing <lb/>
Christians, and for twelve consecutive Sundays <lb/>
Mrs. Booth based her addresses upon the one text, <lb/>
"Go work to-day in My vineyard!" She spoke for <lb/>
about an hour each time, and so far from exhausting <lb/>
her subject, could only promise her hearers that she <lb/>
would resume it on the following Sunday, but <lb/>

<pb entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0163"/>
<pb n="153" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0164"/>
whether to conclude or not was more than she <lb/>
could tell!</p>
<p>In 1874, Mrs. Booth became deeply interested in <lb/>
the American Whisky War, and the result was the <lb/>
inauguration by the Mission of a Drunkards' Rescue <lb/>
Brigade, which from the first was "signally blessed <lb/>
in reaching and reclaiming many of the most forlorn <lb/>
and degraded of this class."</p>
<p>In 1875, we find Mrs. Booth suffering acutely from <lb/>
her second attack of <hi rend="italic">angina pectoris</hi>. For several <lb/>
weeks she was confined to her room, her symptoms <lb/>
at times being most agonising and alarming. <reg orig="Hydro-|pathy">Hydropathy</reg> <lb/>
was, however, on this occasion, resorted to, <lb/>
and with such happy effects that, after a period of <lb/>
rest, she became able to continue her beloved work <lb/>
once more.</p>
<p>The following years were especially marked by <lb/>
the appearance of several of the young Booths in <lb/>
public as assistants in their parents' work. As <lb/>
early as 1870, indeed, Bramwell,then a lad of only <lb/>
fourteen, had commenced to address adult <reg orig="congre-|gations">congregations</reg>, <lb/>
both indoors and in the open air. Shortly <lb/>
after, Catherine followed her brother's example, and <lb/>
she, too, was scarcely more than a child when she <lb/>
first spoke to an audience in the street. Emma <lb/>
commenced in 1877, and the others, one by one, <lb/>
joined the ranks of preachers in the Mission at an <lb/>
astonishingly tender age.</p>
<p>It was not until the Christmas of this year &lpar;1877&rpar;, <lb/>
that the Mission was called by its afterwards <reg orig="world-|famed">world-famed</reg> <lb/>
name of "The Salvation Army." This was <lb/>
Mr. Booth's own idea, and it was used first on his <lb/>
annual printed appeal for help.</p>
<pb n="154" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0165"/>
<p>The military notion once started, it was found so <lb/>
singularly suitable to the work in many ways, that <lb/>
"Captains," "Colonels," and "Corps," soon followed. <lb/>
A flag was designed, of which the blue border <lb/>
symbolised holiness, the scarlet ground typified <reg orig="salva-|tion">salvation</reg> <lb/>
by the blood of Christ, and the yellow star in <lb/>
the centre betokened the baptism of the Holy Ghost. <lb/>
Similarly, the motto of the Army, "Blood and Fire," <lb/>
represents salvation and the fire of the Spirit. It <lb/>
was an easy and natural thing that the title of <lb/>
"General Superintendent of the Mission," which <lb/>
Mr. Booth had long borne, should be shortened into <lb/>
simply "The General," and with, finally, a uniform <lb/>
designed by Mrs. Booth, in accordance with her <lb/>
ambition to look, as well as be, totally unlike "the <lb/>
world," the army scheme was complete.</p>
<p>After this, the annals of the services teem with <reg orig="ex-|periences">experiences</reg> <lb/>
of "bombardments" accomplished, "<reg orig="strong-|holds">strongholds</reg>" <lb/>
taken, and "battles" won. The poorest, the <lb/>
most ignorant, and the most degraded were reached <lb/>
and touched as had never been known before, and <lb/>
such characters as "Happy Eliza," "The Converted <lb/>
Sweep," and the "Hallelujah Giant," were <reg orig="con-|vincing">convincing</reg> <lb/>
evidences of the reality of the victories <lb/>
gained.</p>
<p>In 1880 the <hi rend="italic">War Cry</hi> was launched, and although <lb/>
by this and other literary work the General and his <lb/>
wife might have attained a position of affluence, they <lb/>
chose rather to devote the proceeds of the successful <lb/>
enterprise to the extension of their work.</p>
<p>Limitations of space compel us to pass over much <lb/>
that is deeply interesting in the record of succeeding <lb/>
years. Confining ourselves, of necessity, to a sketch <lb/>
<pb n="155" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0166"/>
of the life of Catherine Booth only, we must <reg orig="reluc-|tantly">reluctantly</reg> <lb/>
omit all reference to the many thrilling episodes <lb/>
in the careers and triumphs of her children, and pass <lb/>
over in silence the names of many noteworthy and <lb/>
influential friends of the Army.</p>
<p>In 1882, the work was carried into India, Sweden <lb/>
and Canada, as in the previous year Miss Booth and <lb/>
her band of soldiers had invaded France on their <reg orig="cam-|paign">campaign</reg> <lb/>
of peace.</p>
<p>The year 1882 was also marked by the marriage of <lb/>
Mrs. Booth's eldest son, Bramwell, to a young lady <lb/>
enthusiastically devoted to the work.</p>
<p>In 1885, the Booths were participators with Mrs. <lb/>
Josephine Butler, Mr. Stead, and others, in the famous <lb/>
Purity Agitation, and were instrumental in bringing <lb/>
about the passing of the much-needed Criminal Law <lb/>
Amendment Act. They also shared in the penalties <lb/>
which followed upon Mr. Stead's bold action in the <lb/>
matter, but emerged safe and triumphant from <lb/>
all their trials, and with increased desires to <lb/>
guard and befriend the unprotected young girls <lb/>
of London.</p>
<p>It was in this year also that <hi rend="italic">All the World</hi> was <lb/>
first published, a magazine which sought to address <lb/>
those to whom the rough-and-ready style of the <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">War Cry</hi> was hardly acceptable.</p>
<p>Mrs. Booth, once more prostrated by illness, now <lb/>
utilised her enforced leisure in writing letters to the <lb/>
latter paper on different subjects suggested by the <lb/>
difficulties of private correspondents, who sought her <lb/>
counsel from all parts of the world. The answer to a <lb/>
father who was in despair concerning the conduct of <lb/>
his grown-up sons, that to a young lady, uneasy about <lb/>
<pb n="156" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0167"/>
her intended marriage to an unconverted lover, and <lb/>
another, embodying Mrs. Booth's views on the subject <lb/>
of spiritualism, may be mentioned as indicating the <lb/>
variety and scope of the topics with which she so ably <lb/>
and sensibly dealt. Our only regret is that we <reg orig="can-|not">cannot</reg> <lb/>
reproduce some of these wise essays in full.</p>
<p>But we must pass on to the closing activities of this <lb/>
remarkable life.</p>
<p>During the latter half of 1886 and the whole of <lb/>
1887, Mrs. Booth not only held crowded meetings in <lb/>
Exeter Hall, and most of the large Salvation Army <lb/>
halls in London, but visited nearly twenty provincial <lb/>
towns in all parts of England. Her denunciations of <lb/>
evil grew stronger and more severe as she realised <lb/>
with greater intensity the need of plain speaking <lb/>
with regard to sin. Nevertheless, her popularity <lb/>
did not undergo the slightest diminution, and at this <lb/>
period it may be said that as a preacher she was in <lb/>
the zenith of her success.</p>
<p>Between the years 1886 and 1890, four more of <lb/>
Mrs. Booth's children were happily and suitably <lb/>
wedded, the chosen partner in each case being <lb/>
one whose whole heart was in the work of the <lb/>
Army.</p>
<p>In 1886, Commander Ballington Booth was married <lb/>
to Miss Maud Charlesworth; in 1887 the Mar&eacute;chale <lb/>
gave her hand to Commissioner Booth-Clibborn; in <lb/>
1888 Miss Emma Booth became Mrs. <reg orig="Booth-|Tucker">Booth-Tucker</reg>, <lb/>
and the last of the four was Commandant <lb/>
Herbert Booth, who was united to Miss Coraline <lb/>
Schoch.</p>
<p>It is a sad transition from the wedding-feast to the <lb/>
chamber of death! But even at the time that this <lb/>
<pb n="157" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0168"/>
last wedding took place, Mrs. Booth's family realised <lb/>
with anguish that her days on earth were numbered, <lb/>
and she was already too ill to be present at the <lb/>
ceremony.</p>
<p>On the 21st of June, 1888, the great woman-<reg orig="evan-|gelist">evangelist</reg> <lb/>
gave her last public address, and the scene of <lb/>
this farewell utterance was the City Temple.</p>
<p>On this occasion, all forgetful of her weakness in <lb/>
her enthusiasm for the souls of those who listened, <lb/>
Mrs. Booth spoke for upwards of an hour, but so <reg orig="ex-|hausted">exhausted</reg> <lb/>
was she at the close that it was some <reg orig="con-|siderable">considerable</reg> <lb/>
time before she could be removed from the <lb/>
pulpit.</p>
<p>In the autumn of this year she stayed for a while <lb/>
at "Oceanville," Clacton-on-Sea&mdash;a house previously <lb/>
selected by her as a home of rest for the officers of <lb/>
the Army. But she received no permanent benefit <lb/>
from the visit. She liked the quiet of the place so <lb/>
much, however, that she returned in August, 1889, <lb/>
and remained there until her death.</p>
<p>After Mrs. Booth was incapacitated from work in <lb/>
public, and even, by the effect of the disease upon her <lb/>
right arm, unable any longer to write, she continued <lb/>
to dictate letters and advise with those who sought <lb/>
her help.</p>
<p>Her last message to the myriads who loved and <lb/>
honoured her, looking upon her as their spiritual <lb/>
mother, was unrolled before the eyes of the 20,000 <lb/>
persons who were gathered in the nave of the Crystal <lb/>
Palace at the anniversary celebration in 1890. It had <lb/>
been printed upon a wide strip of calico, in letters so <lb/>
large that it could be deciphered in all parts of the <lb/>
building, and ran as follows:&mdash;</p>
<pb n="158" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0169"/>
<p>"My dear Children and Friends,&mdash;My place is <lb/>
empty, but my heart is with you. You are my joy and <lb/>
my crown. Your battles, sufferings and victories have <lb/>
been the chief interests of my life these twenty-five <lb/>
years. They are so still. Go forward. Live holy <lb/>
lives. Be true to the Army. God is your strength. <lb/>
Love and seek the lost; bring them to the blood. <lb/>
<figure id="f31" rend="block" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0169">
<head>OCEANVILLE, CLACTON-ON-SEA.</head>
</figure>
Make the people good; inspire them with the Spirit <lb/>
of Jesus Christ. Love one another; help your <lb/>
comrades in dark hours. I am dying under the Army <lb/>
flag; it is yours to live and fight under. God is my <lb/>
salvation and refuge in the storm. I send you my <lb/>
love and blessing.&mdash;<hi rend="small-caps">Catherine Booth</hi>."</p>
<p>"The effect", we are told, "was electrical. The <lb/>
<pb n="159" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0170"/>
whole congregation was bathed in tears, and from <lb/>
thousands of hearts there went up fresh vows of <reg orig="con-|secration">consecration</reg> <lb/>
recorded in Heaven, and since fulfilled on <lb/>
earth."</p>
<p>On the 4th of October 1890, after having bidden <lb/>
most touching farewells to all her children and <reg orig="grand-|children">grandchildren</reg>, <lb/>
and many of the more prominent members <lb/>
<figure id="f32" rend="block" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0170">
<head>INTERIOR OF MRS. BOOTH'S SITTING-ROOM, OCEANVILLE.</head>
<p>&lpar;<hi rend="italic">The Vacant Chair</hi>.&rpar;</p>
</figure>
of the Salvation Army, the grand, indomitable spirit <lb/>
of Catherine Booth was at length released from its <lb/>
tenement of pain. Her last audible words were, <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">"I see!"</hi></p>
<p>One might fill pages with graphic descriptions of <lb/>
the "lying-in-state" at the Congress Hall, Clapton, <lb/>
when the body in a coffin with a glass panel was <lb/>
<pb n="160" entity="Chappell_FourNobleWomen_0171"/>
viewed by upwards of 40,000 persons, and of the <lb/>
funeral at Olympia, attended by 36,000, while <lb/>
thousands more were turned away for want of room. <lb/>
But our task is done; and we cannot better close <lb/>
this inadequate memoir than with two verses <lb/>
which aptly describe the feelings of those left <lb/>
behind:&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="stanza">
<l>"'Promoted to glory'! From leading our legions,</l>
<l rend="indent">Not parted for ever, but gone on before;</l>
<l>'Promoted,' exalted to Paradise regions,</l>
<l rend="indent">'Promoted,' not perished, 'than conqueror more.'</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>'Promoted to glory!' Blest Mother, we'll follow!</l>
<l rend="indent">By blood and by fire our foes we'll defeat.</l>
<l>We'll 'love one another,' scorn earth-joys so hollow,</l>
<l rend="indent">And march on until 'in the morning' we meet."</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>THE END.</p>
