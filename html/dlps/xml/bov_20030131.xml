                    corrected to delete "Jr." when referring to <name>William C. Killgallon</name>,
                    son of the late <name>William C. Killgallon, Sr.</name> Thus, the first line of
                    the resolution should read "WHEREAS, <name>Martin L. Killgallon</name> and
                        <name>William C. Killgallon</name>....." etc.</p>

                <p>2. On page 6318, after the resolution naming the <name>C. Ray Smith</name>
                    Allumni Hall at the Darden School, the following paragraph should be
                    inserted:</p>

                <p>The <name>Rector</name> asked for a motion approving the Minutes of the October
                    meeting of the Board. A resolution of approval was moved, seconded, and adopted. </p>

                <p>The <name>Rector</name> reported on actions taken by the Executive Committee at
                    its meetings of <dateRange from="2002-10-18" to="2002-12-09">October 18,

                    meetings are listed at the end of these Minutes; see also the separate Minutes
                    of those meetings of the Executive Committee).</p>

                <p>The <name>Rector</name> asked for approval to consider the addition of three
                    items to the Agenda: one to be considered by the Buildings and Grounds
                    Committee, one by the Educational Policy Committee and one by the full Board. By
                    the following resolution, the Board approved the consideration of these
                    items.</p>

                <head type="main">RESOLUTION TO APPROVE ADDITIONAL ACTION ITEMS</head>

                <p>RESOLVED that the Board of Visitors approves the addition of items to the Agenda,
                    for consideration by the Board.</p>
                <p rend="center">- - - - - - - - - - </p>
                <pb n="6309"/>

                <p><name>The Rector</name> then asked for consideration of two resolutions passed by
                    the Executive Committee the day before. The first resolution shortened the term
                    of the Rector from four years to two years, creating the position of Vice Rector
                    who would automatically succeed the Rector, and except for the election to be
                    held at the next Board meeting in April, would begin the Rector's term on July
                        1<hi rend="super">st</hi>. The Vice Rector would serve on the Executive
                    Committee with the Rector, thus increasing the total membership of that
                    committee to six. All of these changes to the <hi rend="underline">Manual</hi>
                    would require changes to the <hi rend="underline">Code of Virginia</hi> by the
                    General Assembly. The resolution suggested by the Executive Committee also makes
                    minor adjustments to the <hi rend="underline">Manual</hi> which do not call for
                    changes to the <hi rend="underline">Code</hi>.</p>

                <p>A companion resolution authorizes the University to seek emergency legislation at
                    this Session of the General Assembly in order that the changes to the <hi
                        rend="underline">Manual</hi> might be in effect by the April meeting of the
                    Board, the meeting at which the Rector and Vice Rector would be elected.</p>

                <p>On motion, the two resolutions were approved. </p>

            <div1 id="d8" type="resolution">
                <head type="main">APPROVAL OF REVISIONS TO THE MANUAL</head>

                <p>RESOLVED, the Executive Committee of the Board of Visitors approves changes to
                    the <hi rend="underline">Manual</hi> of the Board to shorten the term of Rector
                    to two years; to create the office of Vice Rector who would serve for two years,

                    two years; to set the date of the first election of the Rector and Vice Rector,

                    to establish the term of office for both positions to commence in April 2003,

                <p>RESOLVED FURTHER, the Executive Committee approves conforming changes to the <hi

                <p>RESOLVED, the University is authorized to take such other and further action as
                    may be necessary or appropriate to seek in the current session of the General
                    Assembly an amendment to Chapter 9, Sections 23-74 and 23-75 of the <hi
                        rend="underline">Code of Virginia</hi>, consistent with the changes approved

                <ornament type="characters">- ------------</ornament>
                <p>The <name>Rector</name> then asked the President to give his customary
                    report.</p>

                <p>The President told the Board about meetings with alumni groups around the country
                    in preparation for the next Capital Campaign, as well as meetings with alumni
                    groups in the state to discuss the University's budget situation. He mentioned
                    several honors and awards that have come to members of the University community:
                    a Mitchell Scholarship, the first awarded to a student or alumnus of the
                    University, to <name>Mr. John Kiess</name>, who took a B.A. from the College in
                    2001; the Public Service Group Achievement Award (from NASA) to <name>Mr.

                    Center, as Executive Director of the federal 9/11 Commission; and the Mellon
                    Distinguished Achievement Award to <name>Mr. McGann</name> of the English
                    Department.</p>

                <p>The President noted the death, on <date value="2002-12-21">December 21,
                        2002</date>, of <name>Mr. Champ Clark</name>, former Member of the Board of
                    Visitors and former member of the faculty, and he paid special recognition to
                    the four Members of the Board whose terms expire this winter &mdash; <name>Ms.
                        Twohy and Mrs. Holland and Messrs. Ackerly and Greer.</name></p>

                <p>Turning to his usual report on gifts and grants, the President summarized gifts
                    made between the beginning of the current fiscal year in July and <date
                        value="2002-11-30">November 30, 2002</date>. Private giving in this period
                    was $140.7million, an increase of $57.4 million or over 68% from the same period
                    last year. Pledges and other commitments bring the total to $160.9 million.</p>

                <pb n="6311"/>
                <p>The President noted the bequest of $111 million of the late <name>David A.
                        Harrison, III</name>, of Prince George County, who died on <date
                        value="2002-06-08">June 8, 2002</date>. The bequest is allocated as a $47.2
                    million deferred gift, to be realized in 25 years; $34.8 million to the School
                    of Law; $20.3 million to the School of Medicine; $5.8 million to the Athletics
                    Department; and $3.1 million to fulfill a pledge to the University Library. He
                    noted other gifts and pledges, including an anonymous $10 million pledge to the
                    McIntire School of Commerce Foundation for its building campaign.</p>

                <p>On motion, the Gifts and Grants Report was accepted by the Board.</p>

                <p>The meeting of the full Board was recessed at 9:10 a.m., for the meeting of the

                    <head type="main">I. Preamble </head>
                    <lb/>
                    <p>The University of Virginia Separation Incentive Program for Faculty (the
                        "Program") has been established to meet institutional needs created by
                        reductions in the University's 2002-2004 biennial budget. The program is
                        designed to reduce or reallocate positions in keeping with budgetary and
                        programmatic needs.<lb/></p>

                    <p>In order to reap budgetary savings during Fiscal Years 2003 and 2004, this
                        program will apply only to separation contracts executed in the Spring of
                        2003. Applicants to the severance portion of the program may separate no
                        later than May 2004 for nine-month faculty, and June 2004 for 12-month
                        faculty. Applicants to the phased retirement portion of the program must
                        begin their phased retirements no later than <date value="2003-08-25">August
                            25, 2003</date>, for nine-month faculty and <date value="2003-06-25"
                            >June 25, 2003</date>, for 12-month faculty. The total cost in any
                        fiscal year of the Separation Payment Contract portion of the Program may
                        not exceed $2 million. The Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia
                        reserves the right to modify, amend, or repeal the Program at any time.</p>


                    <p>The Program has been designed to meet the management needs of the University
                        and the needs of the faculty. Eligible faculty members may apply for, and if
                        selected, participate in this program. A faculty member's election to
                        participate is irrevocable seven days after the faculty member signs a
                        separation contract. There are no penalties for declining to participate;
                        however, failure to obtain significant budgetary savings as a result of this
                        program could exacerbate budgetary shortfalls and require the University to
                        pursue other more drastic measures.</p>
