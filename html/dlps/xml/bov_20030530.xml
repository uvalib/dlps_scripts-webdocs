                <p>The Rector asked the President for his customary report.</p>
                <p>The President mentioned the successful “Reimagining Ireland” conference,
                    sponsored by the Virginia Foundation for Humanities, which took place last
                    month. The President of Ireland came to lunch at Carr’s Hill on May 8th, a
                    gathering which several Members of the Board attended. </p>
                <p>Even though the University’s study abroad programs in China, Southeast Asia,
                    Morocco and Jordan have been cancelled this summer (because of epidemics or
                    security considerations), <pb n="6435"/> there are more students from the
                    University studying abroad this summer than last. The President noted the good
                    work of <name>Mr. William Quandt</name>, the first Vice Provost for
                    International Programs, who is stepping down after three years to return to
                    full-time teaching and research. </p>
                <p>Finally, the President congratulated the men’s lacrosse team, which won the NCAA
                    national championship in Baltimore on May 26th. He noted that <name>Mr.
                        Glazer</name>’s son, Charlie, is a member of the team. </p>

                    School of Medicine. </p>
                <p>The President concluded his report by highlighting two recent gifts: a $22million

                    construction of a performing arts center on the corner of Massie Road and Emmet

                    <div3 id="d85" type="part">
                    <head type="sub">I. Preamble</head>
                    <p> Chapters 995 and 933 of the 1996 Acts of Assembly (House Bill No. 884 and
                        Senate Bill No. 389, respectively) delegated limited but significant
                        autonomy to the University of Virginia to establish its own
                        postappropriation system for undertaking the implementation of non-general
                        fund capital projects for the University of Virginia Medical Center. In
                        general, the autonomy is designed to replace the traditional post
                        appropriations system of reviews, approvals, policies and procedures carried
                        out by a variety of central State agencies identified in the enabling
                        legislation. The University's system for carrying out the post-appropriation
                        capital outlay process for non-general fund capital projects of the Medical
                        Center is to be governed by policies adopted by the Board of Visitors.
                        Similarly, § 4-5.08 of the 1996 Appropriation Act delegated nearly identical
                        limited autonomy to the University as a whole for non-general fund capital
                        projects authorized for the 1996-1998 biennium. <pb n="2"/> This authority
                        has since been continued through 2002-2004 by subsequent legislative action.
                        This latter delegation of autonomy is subject to certain conditions, the
                        foremost of which is that the Board of Visitors must adopt a system of
                        reviews and approvals for University non-general fund capital projects and
                        submit the proposed system for prior approval to the Secretaries of Finance
                        and Administration prior to <date value="1996-09-01">September 1,
                            1996</date>. More recently § 4-5.08 of the 2003 Appropriation Act
                        extended the delegated authority approved in § 4-5.08 of the 1996
                        Appropriation Act by creating a pilot program delegating post-appropriation
                        review and approval to the University for selected state general fund or
                        state-supported debt capital projects as defined in Section 4-5.08f of
                        Chapter 1042-2003 Acts of Assembly. This latest delegation of autonomy is
                        subject to certain conditions, the foremost of which is that the Board of
                        Visitors must adopt a system of reviews and approvals for University state
                        general fund and statesupported debt capital projects and submit the
                        proposed system for approval to the Secretaries of Finance and
                        Administration prior to <date value="2003-08-01">August 1, 2003</date>. </p>

                    <p> The following provisions of this policy statement are based on the 1996
                        policy statement for non-general fund projects with modifications added that
                        extend the policy to include state general fund and state-supported debt
                        projects as provided in Section 4-5.08f.1. of Chapter 1042 -2003 Acts of
                        Assembly. This statement constitutes the adopted Board of Visitors policies
                        regarding both Medical Center state general fund, statesupported debt, and
                        non-general fund capital projects and other University state general fund,

                    <p> The current pre-planning process and budget development process for capital
                        projects has not been altered by the enabling legislation. Consequently,
                        this policy statement will only apply to post-appropriation implementation
                        of capital projects which are funded <pb n="5"/> entirely or in part by a
                        state general fund, state supported debt, or non-general fund appropriation
                        made by the General Assembly. Specifically, this policy applies to items
                        identified as authorized capital projects for the University of Virginia or
                        the University of Virginia Medical Center in an Appropriation Act enacted by
                        the General Assembly and approved by the Governor. For non- Medical Center
                        projects at the University, this policy is applicable only during the
                        1996-1998 biennium unless extended or continued by a subsequent act of the
                        General Assembly. In accordance with the 2003 Appropriations Act new

                        costing in excess of $100,000. The terms and structure of any financing of
                        any capital project shall remain subject to other provisions of law
                        including, but not limited to, § 2.2-2416 of the Code of Virginia. </p>

                        management of University capital <pb n="6"/> projects. The system may
                        include the delegation of management authority to appropriate University
                        officials, including a grant of authority to such officials to engage in
                        further delegation of authority as the President or his designee deems
                        appropriate. </p>
                    <p> The management system for capital projects shall be designed to insure that
                        such projects comply with the provisions of this policy statement and other
                        Board of Visitors policies applicable to closely related subjects such as
                        selection of architects or policies applicable to University buildings and
                        grounds. </p>
                    <p> The management system may include a reporting system applicable to capital
                        projects whereby University officials responsible for the management of such
                        projects provide appropriate and timely reports to the President or his
                        designee on the status of such projects during construction. The project
                        status reporting system adopted by the President or his designee may include
                        requirements for prior consultation with and approval by the President or
                        his designee as are deemed appropriate. </p>

                    <p> It shall be the policy of the University of Virginia that the implementation
                        of capital projects shall be carried out so that the project as completed is
                        the project authorized by the General Assembly. The President or his
                        designee shall insure strict adherence to this requirement. </p>
                    <p> Accordingly, no Medical Center capital project shall be materially increased
                        in size or materially changed in scope beyond the plans and justifications
                        which were the basis for the project's appropriation, either before or
                        during construction, unless: (i) the President or his designee determines
                        that such increase in size or change in scope is necessary due to an
                        emergency and the Governor concurs in such determination, or (ii) the
                        General Assembly approves such increase or change in a subsequent
                        appropriation. </p>
                    <p> Similarly, no University capital project other than a Medical Center capital
                        project shall be materially increased in size or materially changed in scope
                        beyond the plans and justifications which were the basis for the project's
                        appropriation, either before or during <pb n="8"/> construction, unless: (i)
                        such increase in size or change in scope is required because of
                        circumstances determined by the Governor to be an emergency, or (ii) the
                        General Assembly approves such increase or change in a subsequent
                        appropriations. Minor increases in square footage shall be permissible if
                        they are determined by the Director of the Department of General Services to
                        be reasonable based on a written justification submitted by the University
                        stating the necessity for the increases, with the condition that such
                        increases would not increase the cost of the project beyond the amount
                        appropriated. </p>

                    <head type="sub">VII. Acquisition of Land for Capital Projects</head>
                    <p> It is the policy of the University that projects involving land acquisition
                        will be subjected to thorough inquiry and due diligence prior to closing on
                        the acquisition of such land. The President or his designee shall insure
                        that the management system <pb n="11"/> implemented pursuant to Section III
                        provides for a review and analysis of all pertinent matters relating to the
                        acquisition of land as any prudent purchaser would perform to the end that
                        any land acquired by the University shall be suitable for its intended
                        purpose, that the acquisition can be made without discernable risk of
                        liability to the University and that the cost of the land to be acquired,
                        together with any contemplated development thereof, will be such that
                        compliance with the provisions of Section VI of this policy statement is
                        achieved. In addition, the President or his designee shall insure that,
                        where feasible and appropriate to do so, the following specific policies
                        pertaining to the acquisition of land for capital projects are carried out. </p>
                    <p> (a) Environmental and Land Use Considerations. While pre-appropriation
                        activities relating to planning and budget development of capital projects
                        are not subject to this policy statement, it is sometimes the case with
                        projects involving land acquisition that certain environmental and land use
                        planning requirements cannot be fulfilled until after the appropriation
                        process has been completed. In such cases, depending on the cost of the <pb
                            n="12"/> land and any contemplated development thereof, the University
                        may be required, as a matter of law, to file an Environmental Impact Report
                        ("EIR") with the Department of Environmental Quality ("DEQ") in order to
                        perfect its authority to expend funds for a capital project (see Section
                        IX). If an EIR requirement is applicable in the post-appropriation phase of
                        a project involving land acquisition, the project management system
                        implemented by the President or his designee pursuant to Section IX shall
                        assure that no closing on such land acquisition takes place until after the
                        EIR requirement has been fulfilled. </p>
                    <p> It is the policy of the University to cooperate with each locality to whom
                        an EIR is furnished by DEQ during the post-appropriation phase of a project
                        involving land acquisition. Such cooperation shall include but not be
                        limited to furnishing any information which the locality may reasonably
                        request and reviewing any requests by the locality with regard to any such
                        capital project. The University will assure examination of the zoning and
                        comprehensive plan designation of the land and surrounding parcels by the
                        locality, as well as any designation of <pb n="13"/> historically or
                        archeologically significant areas on the land by state or federal agencies. </p>
                    <p> (b) Infrastructure and Site Condition. The President or his designee shall
                        insure that, in the case of projects involving the acquisition of land, the
                        management system implemented under Section III provides for a review of the
                        following matters prior to acquisition of the land: that the land can be
                        developed for its intended purpose without extraordinary cost; that an
                        environmental engineer has been engaged by the University to provide an
                        assessment of any environmental conditions on the land; that there is
                        adequate vehicular ingress and egress to serve the contemplated use of the
                        land; that utilities and other services to the land are adequate; and that
                        the condition and grade of the soils have been examined to determine if any
                        conditions exist which would require extraordinary site work or foundation
                        systems. </p>
                    <p> (c) Title and Survey. An ALTA survey shall be prepared for the land and an
                        examination of title to the land shall be conducted by a licensed attorney
                        or, in the alternative, a commitment for title insurance shall be procured
                        from a title insurance company authorized to do <pb n="14"/> business in the
                        Commonwealth of Virginia. Based upon the survey and title examination or
                        report, the President or his designee shall conclude, prior to acquisition
                        of the land, that title to the land will be conveyed to the University in
                        fee simple, free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, covenants,
                        restrictions, easements or other matters which may have a significant
                        adverse effect upon the University's ability to own, occupy, convey or
                        develop the land. </p>
                    <p> (d) Appraisal. An appraisal shall be conducted of the land to determine its
                        fair market value and the consistency of the fair market value with the
                        price agreed upon by the University. </p>

                    <head type="sub">VIII. Capital Project Compliance With The Code Of<lb/> Virginia </head>
                    <p> Among the requirements of the enabling legislation is that, notwithstanding
                        the delegation of limited, postappropriation autonomy to the University
                        regarding University-wide and Medical Center capital projects, all such
                        projects must nevertheless comply with the provisions of the Code of
                        Virginia regarding capital projects, excluding only the review, approval,
                        policy and procedure <pb n="15"/> functions of central State agencies which
                        are referenced in the enabling legislation. </p>
                    <p> It therefore shall be the policy of the University that capital projects

                        President or his designee shall take all necessary and reasonable steps to
                        assure (i) that University officials responsible for the implementation of
                        capital projects are knowledgeable regarding the requirements of the Code of
                        Virginia and the Appropriation Act regarding capital projects, and (ii) that
                        compliance is achieved. </p>

                    <p> The Board is cognizant that the Department of Environmental Quality is
                        authorized pursuant to provisions of Title 10.1 of the Code of Virginia to
                        require all state agencies to submit an environmental impact report ("EIR")
                        for any state project which involves (i) the acquisition of any interest in
                        land for any state facility <pb n="16"/> construction or (ii) the

                        acquisition or construction costs $100,000 or more. Accordingly, it is the
                        policy of the University of Virginia that, in all cases in which an EIR is
                        required but has not been filed with DEQ during budget development, no land
                        acquisition shall take place and no construction on such land or previously
                        acquired land shall be commenced for any capital project until the
                        University has complied with the EIR requirements as set forth in the Code

                        not to adversely affect the project. </p>
