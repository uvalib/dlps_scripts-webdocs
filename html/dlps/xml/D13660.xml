                    no punctuation and so to make reading this transcript easier, three spaces have been
                    left blank after each complete thought. Spelling is as found. Words written above the
                    line are shown thusly; ^'arrived'. [-] indicates a word that can not be deciphered. If a
                    word or proper name is unclear, a question mark is inserted, such as Wirlister [?].]</p>

                Apfelbaum, from whom it was purchased in 2006, "Charlottesville in the Civil
                War: 115 page manuscript diary, for all of 1864, written by George W. Hichborn
                (Company B, 20th Maine Regiment - related in some way to Paul Revere). He writes
                good entries every day, but on May 5th [at the Battle of the Wilderness] he is
                wounded in the face...in June he is in Charlottesville...and from July to November
                he is at Andersonville Prison and tells of the harsh treatment and the poor food
                or lack of food there." See transcription notes at the end of this document.]</p>
