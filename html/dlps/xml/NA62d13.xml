                <p>Addie mentions being upset after reading about the battle of Pittsburg Landing,
                    and she anticipates with dread the Battle of Yorktown, which she expects to
                    occur soon. She asks Charlie to send her a full-length photograph of himself,
                    and she mentions the burial of Wallace Coburn of Bazetta, a nearby township, who
                    was a soldier in the Seventh Ohio Regiment.</p>

                <p> Would you not like<lb/> to converse a short time with Addie this mor-<lb/> ning?
                    Perhaps I can not be quiet long enough<lb/> to write much of a letter. for I
                    heard this<lb/> morning. that <name type="person">Hallie</name>is over to
                    Auntie's and<lb/> I wish very much to see him. I do not<lb/> know whether he
                    will come over home<lb/> or not. I presume I can be more contented<lb/> when
                    writing to you than any other way..<lb/> I do not feel very contented any way to
                    day.<lb/> the battle of <name type="battle">Pittsburg Landing</name> has
                    occupied<lb/> my thoughts most of the time since<lb/> thursday. How frightful! I
                    have been reading<lb/> the particulars of it this morning. and<lb/> it causes me
                    to tremble. I would so like<lb/> to know if you are safe to day dear <orig

                    <pb n="2" entity="DSSR_000000766_0028"/> I feel so lonely and sad to day that
                    all manner<lb/> of thoughts enter my mind. Perhaps it is wrong<lb/> but I
                    sometimes wish that you were not in the<lb/> army. but I feel that it is your
                    duty to<lb/> be there, therefore I will try and be reconciled.<lb/> I do not
                    wish to discourage you dear one,<lb/> but my heart sometimes rebels.</p>

                <p> I dread reading of the future battle of<lb/>
                    <name type="battle">Yorktown</name>, which is daily expected.</p>

                <p> Charlie, dear will you grant me one favor?<lb/> I wish your photograph very
                    much.. A full length<lb/> one. if you please. (you <orig reg="perceive"

                    <p>A search for &ldquo;Oildom&rdquo; in several web sites listing
                        historical Ohio place names revealed no Ohio town or township by this name.
                        However, it's possible that Addie uses the term to refer to a area of
                        petroleum exploration in or around Trumbull County. An 1897 history of Ohio
                        counties, which has been transcribed (or scanned?) and posted on a
                        genealogical web site, refers to an area in Wood County, Ohio, where oil
                        exploration was pursued during the mid-19th century. In the following quote,
                        the term &ldquo;oildom&rdquo; is used to refer to this area:
                        &ldquo;The early ventures of oildom south of the village, though
                        earnest, did not succeed in finding petroleum 'in paying quantities, though
                        latterday explorations in Troy and Lake leave little room for doubting the
                        existence of a pool in the old territory.&rdquo; [SOURCE: COMMEMRATIVE
