            Dear Paul:

        		<p>
            Thanks for your newsy letter 
            the 29th.
            </p><p>
            I was greatly surprised at the
            developments re our boy Hall.  That lemon
            Winslow has been pulling the same sort
            of line to Sayles.  Are you sure its
            not Winslow?  He’s gone back to Paris
            and is beefing about being called home
            for the movilization.  Norman predicted
            that Hall woule follow in the foot steps
            of Cowden and take the “cure” but 
            its hard to say.  As we all know
            he’s an awful lier [sic] and hot air artist,
            and every time he sees a fire on
            the ground he comes rushing back
            and reports bringing down a Boche
            but I believe he has the where with
            all in a pinch.  We’ll have a 
            long talk all around when you come
            out and be damned sure to come.
            </p><p>
            The Capt. is off on permission.
            Lieut is running us.  He’s a wild
            one and needs a few bullets near him
            to tame him down.  This morning
            he led us 20 kilometers inside the
            lines and we kept diving on Boches
            there that were in far greater numbers.
            Also thru [sic] new avatiks that went so
            fast we looked as if tied.  Couple of
            Fokkers in the mix up but there
                        
            <pb n="[p.2]"/>
            
            was no battle.  The Lieut got into a
            vrille and spun down from 3,000 meters
            to 500 feet.  We thought it was all
            off.  He’ll keep this “Nach Berlin”
            stuff up once too many times and
            about a half of us will stay
            over there.  Its fool work and does
            no good.  Kiffin’s sore on him for
            being so wild.  The outfit seems to
            have tamed down, anyway, having learnt
            that there are certain precautions to
            follow.  When we first got here no one
            knew anything about this aerial warfare
            as conducted at present and it took
            some while to learn.
            </p><p>
            Peculiar Skipper hasn’t shown up
            yet.  He’s been asked for a long
            time back.
            </p><p>
            Don’t know how Grundy’s pay is
            yet.  Hope for first square up at 
            the beginning of this month.
            </p><p>
            I can’t get over old Victor.  I
            run across things all the time reminding
            me of him and I realize what a 
            fine character has been lost to the
            world.
            </p><p>
            Hurry up and come out.  My love 
            to Mrs. Weeks.</p>
