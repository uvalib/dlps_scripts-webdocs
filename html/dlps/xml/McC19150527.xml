        		<p>
            Here’s how and 
            hoping that everything’s
            sunny again.  Hope your
            brother is walking around
            now and that your
            fiancee is looking in shop
            windows for new things
            for her trousseau.
        		</p>
        		<p>
            I’m sorry to have
            to report that <unclear>Thierry-Delanoue [sp?]</unclear>
            the Vicomte’s friend got
            wounded in yesterday’s
            bombardment.  Twenty people,
            mostly women and children
            were killed and thirty five
            wounded.  I had the pleasant
            task of gathering up some of
            the dead.  It was horrible.
            In one shop, where I had
            
            <pb n="[p.2]"/>
            
            gotten some cakes in 
            the morning, the Madame
            and her daughter lay dead.
            They were frightfully mangled.
            One eye hung out over the 
            bleeding, butchered face and
            I’ll never forget the wild
            look of fear expressed in
            the dead orb.  All down
            the main street were pools
            of blood; shattered glass
            littered the streets and
            the debris of buildings
            blocked the way.  When 
            we got to a hospital with
            our first load we were 
            directed to a long semi circular
            cellar and carried the 
            dead down there.  As far
            as one could see were 
            groaning wounded.  Nurses
            
            <pb n="[p.3]"/>
            
            were bending over them
            and in the dim light 
            given off by the candles
            we noticed relatives
            crying over the wounded
            that were unconscious.
            In one store we had to break
            a window and pull the
            dead thru [sic] it which was
            a nasty job.  On the next 
            trip to the hospital I saw
            an old old man supporting
            his daughter that had
            been hit and whose
            wounds were dressed.  Very
            slowly the old man and
            the little girl in her
            white pinafore walked 
            down the street towards
            their home.  The old fellow
            was very grave and the 
            
            <pb n="[p.4]"/>
            
            child was trying her best
            not to cry.  That impressed
            me as the saddest thing 
            I’d seen.  I don’t know why.
            Immediately afterwards I
            left for a station back
            of the trenches to take
            up my night duty and
            tho [sic] a shell cam down
            there and killed some 
            soldiers that didn’t seem
            horrible.  It was in the
            military atmosphere.  Guns
            and caissons were about
            and soldiers were going
            and returning from the trenches.
            It seemed part of the
            game up there and didn’t
            appear shocking.  In the town;
            in the middle of civil pursuits
            to see the citizens dead and their
            
            <pb n="[p.5]"/>
            
            blood staining the <reg orig="side=|walks">sidewalks</reg> 
           	was a terrible
            thing.  People are rapidly
            evacuating the town
            and it is really what
            should have been done
            months ago.

            A German deserter tells 
            us the Boches have
            30,000 shells to let fly
            into our town before
            they are pushed out of
            range.  That will do
            considerable smearing up
            of the place.  One cannot
            believe all the wild
            stories going around of course.
            Why one rumor “from a most
            reliable source”  had it that
            our caserne was to be
            
            <pb n="[p.6]"/>
            
            smeared off the globe
            at 11:30 a.m.  yesterday.

            Nice, cheerful letter I’ve
            written you.  Excuse me.
            By the way, to turn to
            more interesting things,
            I saw three hundred
            Greek volunteers arrive
            at a point below here
            the other day.  Premier
            Etranger outfit&mdash;new batch&mdash;
            I understand.  One of em [sic]
            said he’d been in New
            York.  “For twoa  [sic] year I sella [sic]
            da [sic] banan [sic].” Great old mob
            you meet over here, Mon
            brave.
