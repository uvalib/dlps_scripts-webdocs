                <p>According to the <hi rend="underline">Manual</hi> of the Board of Visitors, the
                    Executive Committee must be elected each year at the Annual Meeting of the

                    that the current Executive Committee be re-elected.</p>
                <p> The Rector's proposal was moved and seconded and the Executive Committee was
                    re-elected by voice vote.</p>

                    the large gift of land in Albemarle County from <name>Mr. John Kluge</name>. He
                    also announced an anonymous gift of &dollar;20million for the core project of
                    the new Arena. The donor, he said, envisions a building that would be a resource
                    for the community, in addition to serving as a facility for sports teams. The
                    total cost of the Arena project would be approximately &dollar;120 million.</p>

                    until receipt of a baccalaureate degree, whichever is sooner. Payments for each

                    in-state undergraduate student at the University of Virginia as published in the

                    the University of Virginia's Office of Student Financial Services in financial
                    aid calculations. The amount provided will cover in-state tuition and required
                    fees, books and supplies, room and board and an allowance for personal expenses.
                    If any child elects to attend college outside the Commonwealth of Virginia, the
                    amounts calculated (as specified above) for attendance at the University of
                    Virginia will be paid to the college or university of choice. These amounts will
                    be paid so long as <name>Mr. Kaplan</name> is employed full-time as Chancellor
                    by the University of Virginia's College at Wise at the beginning of the semester
                    for which payment is to be made.</p>
