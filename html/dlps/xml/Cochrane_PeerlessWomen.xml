VICTORIA&mdash;MOTHER, WIFE, <lb/>
QUEEN! <lb/>
OR, THE FRIEND OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE.</hi></head>
<div2 type="chapter" n="I" id="d9">
<head><hi rend="bold">CHAPTER I. <lb/>
Early Life.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">When</hi> George IV. died in the year 1830, <lb/>
his brother William became King of <lb/>
England. His wife's name was Adelaide, <lb/>
and they had two little daughters, both of whom <lb/>
died very young. Thus King William was left <lb/>
with no child to take the crown at his death; <lb/>
so the Duke of Kent, a younger brother, was <lb/>
next in succession.</p>
<p>Now the Duke of Kent had married a young <lb/>
widow, Victoria Louisa, sister of that Duke of <lb/>
Saxe-Coburg who afterwards became King of the <lb/>
Belgians. She had one son and one daughter <lb/>
when the Duke of Kent married her, and they <lb/>
all lived for some time after the marriage on an <lb/>
estate belonging to this son, in Bavaria.</p>
<p>After a while, however, the Duke of Kent <lb/>
brought his wife home to England, where, on <lb/>
24th May 1819, a little daughter was born to <lb/>
them. The princess was a fine healthy child, <lb/>
and was given the name of Alexandrina Victoria. <lb/>
<pb n="8" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0019"/>
When she was but nine months old her father <lb/>
died, and she thus became heir-apparent to the <lb/>
throne of England.</p>
<p>The Duchess of Kent was a good and wise <lb/>
woman, and proved herself just the mother to <lb/>
train a child destined to such greatness. All her <lb/>
own relatives, of course, lived on the Continent, <lb/>
but she felt that the probable future Queen of <lb/>
England should be reared an Englishwoman <lb/>
in the truest sense.</p>
<p>When, therefore, she was left a widow for the <lb/>
second time, she devoted herself to her little <lb/>
daughter, to the exclusion of all other ties. She <lb/>
engaged a thoroughly competent German <reg orig="gover-|ness">governess</reg>, <lb/>
to whom was given the care of the <reg orig="educa-|tion">education</reg> <lb/>
of the little princess; although the duchess <lb/>
herself always kept a watchful eye upon the <lb/>
child's studies.</p>
<p>Victoria was a happy-tempered, frolicsome little <lb/>
maiden, kind, thoughtful, and affectionate, quick <lb/>
to learn, observant; clever at music, drawing, and <lb/>
languages, yet withal, firm and resolute of bearing. <lb/>
Her mother wisely withheld from her, for many <lb/>
years, all knowledge that some day she might <lb/>
be queen, and so the child had no notion of her <lb/>
own importance.</p>
<p>She was eleven years old when George IV. died, <lb/>
and her Uncle William became king. It was, <lb/>
therefore, thought well that she should now know <lb/>
how near she was to the throne; so her governess <lb/>
placed in one of her books a paper showing the <lb/>
exact relationship in which she stood to the king.</p>
<p>The princess read this paper carefully, and <lb/>
<pb n="9" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0020"/>
though she was very much astonished, she quite <lb/>
understood all that it meant to her. Had she <lb/>
been any other child than the Princess Victoria, <lb/>
she might have become very proud of herself and <lb/>
given herself airs; but, being the little girl she <lb/>
was, she instantly realised that if she was to be <lb/>
a good queen and fulfil her duties well, she must <lb/>
at once begin to fit herself for her future position. <lb/>
When, therefore, she gravely promised her <reg orig="gover-|ness">governess</reg> <lb/>
to be <hi rend="italic">good</hi>, the child meant just what she <lb/>
said, as her after-life proved.</p>
<p>The court of King William IV. was not exactly <lb/>
a nice place for a young girl to visit, for the <lb/>
king had been a sailor in his early days, and was <lb/>
fond of rough and boisterous companions. The <lb/>
Duchess of Kent, therefore, kept the Princess <lb/>
Victoria away from it as much as possible; and <lb/>
although she knew that her brother-in-law was <lb/>
much annoyed at her so doing, the wise woman <lb/>
felt her daughter's welfare and the future good <lb/>
of the country to be of more importance than his <lb/>
displeasure, and so she firmly pursued her way.</p>
<p>When William IV. died and Victoria became <lb/>
queen, on 20th June 1837, the whole court <reg orig="under-|went">underwent</reg> <lb/>
a complete change. Victoria was only <lb/>
eighteen at this time; but she soon made her <lb/>
views known, and from that time the English <lb/>
court has always been regarded as one of the <lb/>
best conducted in Europe.</p>
<p>Victoria's modest manner and queenly bearing <lb/>
struck everyone with amazement. There were <lb/>
great rejoicings at her accession, though the name <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Victoria</hi> was not at first popular, because it had <lb/>
<pb n="10" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0021"/>
a foreign ring. Nevertheless, the young queen <lb/>
strictly adhered to it, and signed her first state <lb/>
document with that name which afterwards <reg orig="be-|came">became</reg> <lb/>
the synonym for graciousness, and goodness, <lb/>
and inspiring reverence, not only to the people of <lb/>
the British nation but to the peoples of the civilised <lb/>
world.</p>
<p>Her coronation on 2nd June of the following <lb/>
year was carried out with great pomp, and bright <lb/>
hopes of future prosperity were entertained by those <lb/>
who realised, even at that date, that the country was <lb/>
in the hands of a capable if young ruler.</p>
<p>"Poor little queen," Thomas Carlyle said, "she <lb/>
is at an age when a girl can hardly be trusted to <lb/>
choose a bonnet for herself." But she soon proved <lb/>
herself equal to far more important business.</p>
<p>Trade was bad, food dear, and work scarce, and the <lb/>
great mass of the people were, therefore, in a state <lb/>
of general discontent; but the young queen had a <lb/>
very good adviser in Lord Melbourne, and, under <lb/>
his good guidance, matters soon began to right <lb/>
themselves a little. Though there were troubles <lb/>
abroad as well as at home, Queen Victoria quickly <lb/>
found her way to her people's hearts. The Irish, <lb/>
too, were in sore straits, for the potato crop, on <lb/>
which they chiefly relied, failed altogether, and <lb/>
the people were in a state of famine.</p>
<p>They were generously aided by Great Britain <lb/>
and the United States, and the queen did what <lb/>
she could for them. But they valued most of all <lb/>
the loving sympathy she showed them; they felt <lb/>
that she was truly sorry for their distress, and <lb/>
they never forgot it.</p>

<head><hi rend="bold">CHAPTER II. <lb/>
Marriage.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Shortly</hi> before her twenty-first birthday, the <lb/>
queen married her cousin, Albert, Prince of <lb/>
Saxe-Coburg, who was as good and wise <lb/>
as Victoria herself.</p>
<p>The new <hi rend="italic">Prince-Consort</hi>, as he was called, at <lb/>
once set himself to get a good grip of English <lb/>
national affairs, and was soon able to be of <lb/>
much assistance to the queen in all such matters. <lb/>
He proved himself a devoted husband and a wise <lb/>
father, and the people named him "Albert the <lb/>
Good."</p>
<p>Nine children were born to them, four sons <lb/>
and five daughters; and Prince Albert took great <lb/>
interest in their education and general training, <lb/>
bestowing special care on that of the Prince of <lb/>
Wales.</p>
<p>When little Albert Edward was about eight <lb/>
years old, he was taken with the other children <lb/>
on a short visit to Ireland. As the Royal party <lb/>
rode through the streets of Dublin, the people, <lb/>
mindful of her tenderness to them in their great <lb/>
trouble, cried, "Oh, queen dear, make one of <lb/>
them Prince Patrick and all Ireland will die for <lb/>
you!"</p>
<p>The queen was so touched by this request that <lb/>
she not only named her next little son Patrick, but <lb/>
gave to him the title of Duke of Connaught, and <lb/>
to her eldest son that of Earl of Dublin.</p>
<pb n="12" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0023"/>
<p>Prince Albert now thought it would be good <lb/>
for trade if a great International Exhibition was <lb/>
held in London; but many people feared that, as <lb/>
matters both at home and abroad were still very <lb/>
unsettled, it would not be well to attract so many <lb/>
foreigners to the country.</p>
<p>They feared, among other things, that the life <lb/>
of the queen would not be safe. Nevertheless, <lb/>
the Prince-Consort had his wish, and the great <lb/>
exhibition was held, during the year 1851, in a <lb/>
huge Crystal Palace built for the purpose in <lb/>
London. It was an unqualified success, due not <lb/>
only to her husband's efforts but also to the <lb/>
noble way in which they were seconded by the <lb/>
whole kingdom. As the queen herself said <lb/>
afterward, the opening day was one to live in <lb/>
her memory for ever.</p>
<p>Just, however, as affairs seemed to be righting <lb/>
themselves, and things looked brighter, a <reg orig="dread-|ful">dreadful</reg> <lb/>
war broke out between Britain and France on <lb/>
the one side and Russia on the other. All <lb/>
engaged in it suffered terribly, but, of course, our <lb/>
sympathy was greatest for our own men.</p>
<p>The piteous accounts of the fearful hardships <lb/>
they were undergoing roused in the hearts of the <lb/>
people infinite sympathy with the sufferers and <lb/>
intense indignation against those who were chiefly <lb/>
responsible. The tender heart of the good queen <lb/>
was wrung by the woes of her country's brave <lb/>
defenders; she realised that, as queen, she was, <lb/>
in a measure, responsible for their well-being; <lb/>
but, more than this, she felt for their sufferings <lb/>
as if they were her own children.</p>
<pb n="13" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0024"/>
<p>We are sure this was so, for, after distributing <lb/>
the medals to the disabled soldiers who had <lb/>
returned, she said, "My heart bleeds for them; <lb/>
I feel as if they were my nearest and dearest!"</p>
<p>When the war was over and a great review of <lb/>
the returned troops was held, the queen spoke so <lb/>
lovingly, and in so motherly a way to the men, <lb/>
that many of the brave fellows shed tears, and they <lb/>
felt more than ever that she was indeed a queen to <lb/>
love and defend to the utmost.</p>
<p>So much did Victoria take the sufferings of her <lb/>
soldiers to heart, that she decided to build a large <lb/>
and roomy hospital, so that in the future the sick <lb/>
and wounded might have every care and comfort <lb/>
combined with the best medical attention. A site <lb/>
was therefore chosen at Netley, near Southampton, <lb/>
and the foundation-stone of this new military <lb/>
hospital was laid there in May 1856, by the good <lb/>
queen-mother of her men.</p>
<p>It is a splendid building, a quarter of a mile <lb/>
in length, overlooking the broad stretch of <reg orig="South-|ampton">Southampton</reg> <lb/>
Water, and surrounded by a large extent <lb/>
of park land and recreation ground. It is named <lb/>
the Royal Victoria Hospital, and, during its <lb/>
erection, the queen said she would watch over <lb/>
it with motherly anxiety, for she wished it to be <lb/>
a real home to the sick and wounded soldiers she <lb/>
loved so much.</p>
<p>It is a very long time since the hospital was <lb/>
opened, and many thousands of those who have <lb/>
suffered in their country's defence have been <lb/>
restored to health and vigour within its walls.</p>
<p>It has been the scene of much sorrow, but it has <lb/>
<pb n="14" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0025"/>
also had its happy times, for the tender, motherly <lb/>
woman whom we so long called queen, nobly <lb/>
fulfilled the promise she had made.</p>
<p>Her visits to the hospital were always looked <lb/>
upon as the brightest moments in the lives of the <lb/>
sufferers within its walls. As she stood beside <lb/>
their beds, the kindly sympathy of her loving <lb/>
gaze, the tender touch of her soft hand, the sweet <lb/>
words of comfort, made them forget her high <lb/>
estate, and feel only, that of all women, she was <lb/>
the kindest and best.</p>
<p>And this was not all that endeared her to <lb/>
them: her thoughtful care of themselves they <lb/>
fully appreciated; but they loved her far more <lb/>
for her earnest endeavour to guard from want <lb/>
and trouble those who were near and dear to <lb/>
them, while they were engaged in fighting <lb/>
their country's battles&mdash;for the good queen was <lb/>
ever a generous contributor to all funds raised <lb/>
for such purposes.</p>
<p>Thus it was that Victoria gained the love of her <lb/>
soldiers, and, indeed, of her sailors also. When <lb/>
dread war called them from home and dear ones, <lb/>
they went cheerfully to fight for her who, they <lb/>
well knew, would follow their every movement&mdash; <lb/>
rejoicing in their victories, commiserating their <lb/>
defeats, and grieving with the keenest sorrow <lb/>
for those who fell by the way.</p>
<p>"The Queen, God bless her!" was their toast, <lb/>
and they meant it.</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="III" id="d11">
<pb n="15" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0026"/>
<head><hi rend="bold">CHAPTER III. <lb/>
Days of Trial.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Just</hi> a year after the building of Netley Hospital <lb/>
was begun, a terrible mutiny broke out among <lb/>
out Indian troops. They considered their <lb/>
religious feelings had been outraged by a certain <lb/>
order from the military authorities; so they <lb/>
rebelled against it in a most barbarous fashion.</p>
<p>The reports of their dreadful cruelties to the <lb/>
European residents, especially the women and <lb/>
children, were truly revolting, and the heart of <lb/>
the queen was torn with sorrow for her people in <lb/>
that distant land.</p>
<p>For those at home, too, she was in great distress, <lb/>
for many had been ruined by the failure of some <lb/>
of the most important banks. In the midst of <lb/>
all this national trouble, she parted with her <lb/>
eldest daughter, who had been so great a comfort <lb/>
to her.</p>
<p>The Crown Princess married the eldest son of <lb/>
the King of Prussia, in the year 1858, and the <lb/>
present Emperor of Germany is her eldest son. <lb/>
Three years later, the queen's dearly-lover mother <lb/>
passed to her rest, and the queen had scarcely <lb/>
become reconciled to her loss, when a still more <lb/>
severe blow befell her. This was the death of <lb/>
him who had become so much to the good queen <lb/>
that without his loving presence she felt it <lb/>
would be almost impossible to live.</p>
<p>The Prince-Consort returned from a short visit <lb/>
<pb n="16" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0027"/>
to Ireland far from well. He had accompanied <lb/>
the queen and his daughters to see how the <lb/>
Prince of Wales was getting on at the Curragh, <lb/>
where he had gone for a course of military <lb/>
instruction. The Prince-Consort was rather <lb/>
worried, too, about some state affairs, but he <lb/>
seemed to gather strength for a while.</p>
<p>Then he went to look over the New Staff <lb/>
College, at Sandhurst, in a heavy downpour of <lb/>
rain, with the result that he caught a severe chill. <lb/>
Instead of staying at home to be nursed, he next <lb/>
paid a flying visit to Cambridge, where the Prince <lb/>
of Wales was in residence, and it is not at all <lb/>
surprising that he returned to his home thoroughly <lb/>
ill. Still he would not give way, with the result <lb/>
that, weak and ill as he was, when a mild attack <lb/>
of typhoid fever seized him, he never recovered.</p>
<p>The heart-broken queen and his daughter Alice <lb/>
nursed him with the tenderest care, but, in spite <lb/>
of all that medical skill and good nursing could <lb/>
do, Albert the Good, dearly-beloved husband of <lb/>
our gracious Queen Victoria, went home to God on <lb/>
14th December 1861, and with him passed all the <lb/>
joy of our good queen's life.</p>
<p>If the sympathy and loving prayers of a nation <lb/>
could do aught to lessen such a blow, then, indeed, <lb/>
Victoria would have been comforted; her people <lb/>
felt for her in her great trouble as she had so <lb/>
often felt for them in times of stress; but, alas, <lb/>
nothing could ever restore her happiness, though, <lb/>
in time, she became more reconciled to her <lb/>
sorrow.</p>
<p>How she missed him no tongue can tell, and <lb/>
<pb n="17" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0028"/>
for many years she took no part in the social <lb/>
life of the kingdom. Quietly fulfilling every state <lb/>
and domestic duty, she lived in the memories of <lb/>
the past, and, when her duties allowed, spent <lb/>
many months of each succeeding year in the <lb/>
peaceful homes so full of reminiscences of happy <lb/>
bygone days.</p>
<p>Osborne House and Balmoral Castle had been <lb/>
purchased by the queen soon after her marriage, <lb/>
as places in which she and her family might for a <lb/>
time lead a quiet home life, apart from the cares <lb/>
of royalty. No regal state was ever here observed <lb/>
&mdash;all was simplicity and naturalness, so to speak, <lb/>
and nothing ever pleased the widowed queen more <lb/>
than to escape, for a while, to one of these secluded <lb/>
country homes and live again, in fancy, the days <lb/>
of her greatest joy.</p>
<p>A stranger taking a quiet walk on the pleasant <lb/>
country roads between East Cowes and Newport <lb/>
in those old days, might have his attention <lb/>
attracted by a passing horseman, followed almost <lb/>
immediately by an open carriage drawn by four <lb/>
horses.</p>
<p>He would possibly take a cursory glance at the <lb/>
quiet livery of the man on the box seat, or at <lb/>
the two gentlemen seated behind, then at the still <lb/>
more quietly-dressed ladies within the carriage, <lb/>
and he might wonder who they were; but, unless <lb/>
he were afterwards told, he would never imagine <lb/>
that one of those ladies was the world-known ruler <lb/>
of the great British nation.</p>
<p>Yet so it was; for, thank God, our dearly-loved <lb/>
queen had no need of bodyguards when she wished <lb/>
<pb n="18" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0029"/>
to enjoy a quiet drive along the pleasant roads of <lb/>
her own country.</p>
<p>In Balmoral her little pony carriage was a <lb/>
familiar sight, and among the pleasant, homely <lb/>
cottagers no visitor was more welcome than <lb/>
Victoria, their queen. Here she would take a <lb/>
friendly cup of tea; there, with loving touch, <lb/>
she would soothe some humble sufferer, glad to <lb/>
throw off the thraldom of royalty, and be for a <lb/>
while nothing greater than a loving, tender-hearted <lb/>
woman.</p>
<p>Is it any wonder that her people adored her? <lb/>
Is it any wonder that, when she mourned, the <lb/>
nation was sad?&mdash;when she was happy the nation <lb/>
rejoiced?</p>
<p>Her children, one by one, formed new ties, and <lb/>
left the home of their widowed mother; but the <lb/>
ever-increasing prosperity and expansion of her <lb/>
kingdom, bringing in their train manifold duties <lb/>
of state, occupied more and more of the queen's <lb/>
leisure, while many little grandchildren came in <lb/>
time, and in them Victoria herself became young <lb/>
again.</p>
<p>We have all seen pictures of her with various <lb/>
groups of these same children, and if in the face <lb/>
of the queen we trace a somewhat subdued <reg orig="happi-|ness">happiness</reg>, <lb/>
still we should feel thankful that any token <lb/>
of happiness at all was there.</p>

<head><hi rend="bold">CHAPTER IV. <lb/>
Two Jubilees.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">In</hi> the year 1876 Queen Victoria was given the <lb/>
title of "Empress of India," thus marking the <lb/>
success of the India Bill and the extent of the <lb/>
power Britain had obtained over that vast country.</p>
<p>Affairs at home and abroad were in a much <lb/>
more settled state; for, while there had been <lb/>
some trouble in Ireland as well as in Abyssinia <lb/>
and Ashanti, no war of any importance had <lb/>
broken the peace of the country for many years. <lb/>
Commerce was increasing, trade flourishing, and <lb/>
education receiving much more consideration.</p>
<p>National troubles, of course, there were&mdash;such <lb/>
as loss of life by big colliery and shipping <reg orig="dis-|asters">disasters</reg>, <lb/>
and boiler explosions with their consequent <lb/>
misery. In all of these the sufferers received not only <lb/>
substantial help from the queen, but messages of <lb/>
loving sympathy, which, perhaps, they valued <lb/>
most; for they knew that these messages came <lb/>
from a true and tender woman's heart, and they <lb/>
could do no less than revere Victoria&mdash;queen and <lb/>
mother of her people.</p>
<p>There were further troubles in Ireland, and some <lb/>
abroad; but, had it not been for the sad death, at <lb/>
an early age, of the Princess Alice, the queen's life <lb/>
for the next few years would have been fairly serene.</p>
<p>This was the daughter who had helped to <lb/>
nurse her father, who had striven her utmost <lb/>
to restore her brother, the Prince of Wales, to <lb/>
<pb n="20" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0031"/>
health, only a few short years before; and who <lb/>
now, in the prime of life, was carried off by a <lb/>
disease supposed to have been caught while nursing <lb/>
her own children through diphtheria.</p>
<p>She was dearly loved by all who knew her, and <lb/>
when, on 14th December 1878, she passed away, <lb/>
the whole British nation mourned for her. To the <lb/>
widowed queen it was a double trial, for it was <lb/>
on the anniversary of her father's death that the <lb/>
Princess Alice breathed her last.</p>
<p>The queen grieved long for her, and, in the year <lb/>
1884, her grief was renewed by the death of Prince <lb/>
Leopold, Duke of Albany, her youngest son. He <lb/>
had never been strong, but there was no reason <lb/>
to suppose he would die so young. His end was, <lb/>
indeed, quite sudden, and occurred while he was <lb/>
visiting in the south of France.</p>
<p>Three years later, the Jubilee of the queen's reign <lb/>
was celebrated with great pomp. For fifty long <lb/>
years Victoria had been queen, and many were <lb/>
living who could bear witness to the immense <lb/>
change for the better everything had undergone <lb/>
since her accession.</p>
<p>Life at the English court had become pure and <lb/>
good; the people, following her noble example, <lb/>
had reached a much higher standard of life; <lb/>
wages were better, food was cheaper; education <lb/>
had advanced by leaps and bounds; our trade <lb/>
with foreign countries had been established upon <lb/>
a firmer basis; the colonies regarded the <reg orig="mother-|country">mother-country</reg> <lb/>
with loyal affection; oppressed and <reg orig="down-|trodden">downtrodden</reg> <lb/>
races had learned to reverence the Great <lb/>
White Mother, because, through the bravery of <lb/>
<pb n="21" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0032"/>
her sons, they had been freed from the thraldom <lb/>
of tyranny and ignorance; and all these <reg orig="improve-|ments">improvements</reg> <lb/>
were for ever linked with the much-loved <lb/>
name&mdash;Victoria.</p>
<p>So, when this period of her reign arrived, with <lb/>
it came kings, princes, and governors, rulers and <lb/>
representatives of all nations, resplendent in <lb/>
uniforms of glittering gold, attended by retinues <lb/>
no less gorgeously arrayed, and bearing in their <lb/>
hands gifts meet to offer so great a monarch.</p>
<p>Men of all races and tongues, gathered from the <lb/>
remotest quarters of the globe, vied with her own <lb/>
people in doing honour to the Empress-Queen of <lb/>
the British Nation.</p>
<p>London was filled to overflowing by vast <lb/>
numbers of loyal subjects anxious to take part <lb/>
in, or witness, the grand cavalcade that conducted <lb/>
Her Majesty through the streets of the great city <lb/>
to Westminster Abbey, where a solemn service of <lb/>
thanksgiving was held.</p>
<p>The route traversed by the gorgeous procession <lb/>
was gay with colours and thronged with spectators. <lb/>
No event since the queen's coronation had been <lb/>
marked by such a display of magnificence.</p>
<p>London, however, had not a monopoly of the <lb/>
rejoicings, for all over the kingdom f&ecirc;tes were <lb/>
held. Banners waved, flags flew, bands played, <lb/>
the richer people feasted their poorer neighbours, <lb/>
the gathering gloom of the summer night was <lb/>
brightened by brilliant displays of fireworks, <lb/>
while, from every height, huge bonfires sent their <lb/>
lurid flames into the darkness above.</p>
<p>Ten years later, just such another festival was <lb/>
<pb n="22" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0033"/>
held to mark the completion of the sixtieth year <lb/>
of Victoria's reign. It was named by the Prince <lb/>
of Wales "The Diamond Jubilee." The <reg orig="mag-|nificence">magnificence</reg> <lb/>
of the Jubilee of 1887 was equalled, if <lb/>
not surpassed; yet it was but a fitting tribute to <lb/>
her, under whose rule Britain had become <reg orig="fore-|most">foremost</reg> <lb/>
among the nations of the earth.</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="V" id="d13">
<head><hi rend="bold">CHAPTER V. <lb/>
The Last Great Grief.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">During</hi> the long reign of Queen Victoria <lb/>
the people of these islands witnessed many <lb/>
changes. Our forefathers would scarcely <lb/>
believe themselves in Britain could they but return <lb/>
to earth and see our railway trains travelling at <lb/>
the rate of sixty miles an hour; our electric <reg orig="tram-|cars">tramcars</reg> <lb/>
passing through crowded thoroughfares far <lb/>
more quickly than the old stage-coaches moved <lb/>
along deserted country roads; our ocean <reg orig="grey-|hounds">greyhounds</reg> <lb/>
conveying passengers to America in as <lb/>
many days as their old sailing ships took weeks.</p>
<p>One wonders what they would think of being <lb/>
able to talk with persons miles away, or of being <lb/>
able to send and receive messages not only over <lb/>
the land but under the sea? The numberless <lb/>
telegraph and telephone wires that now cross and <lb/>
recross our streets, not so very far above our <lb/>
heads, would strike them with unbounded awe; <lb/>
while such things are looked upon as matters of <lb/>
course by the smallest child in the kingdom now.</p>
<pb n="23" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0034"/>
<p>How they would marvel at the ease with which <lb/>
we now span flowing rivers and winding valleys <lb/>
by bridges that are wonders of skill even in these <lb/>
days of civil engineering; or, hindered in our <lb/>
designs by the width of some waterway, calmly <lb/>
cut for ourselves a passage beneath its solid bed!</p>
<p>The seas, which were to them almost sealed <lb/>
books, are now so well known, together with their <lb/>
secrets of ocean currents, and rocks, and islands, <lb/>
and hidden reefs, that they have become to us busy <lb/>
highroads to the remotest corners of the globe.</p>
<p>To go back somewhat further: it would be <lb/>
interesting to hear the remarks of Sir Richard <lb/>
Grenville, could he but view his old flag-ship side <lb/>
by side with a modern ship of war! Our soldiers <lb/>
and sailors have ever been renowned for their <lb/>
daring bravery and skill in defence of home and <lb/>
country; yet even here the reign of Victoria ranks <lb/>
first, not indeed for greater heroism, but for more <lb/>
victories in the length of time.</p>
<p>Education of the highest kind is now open to <lb/>
the poorest in the land, for it is possible to <reg orig="pro-|ceed">proceed</reg> <lb/>
straight from the elementary schools to the <lb/>
universities.</p>
<p>Art and music and literature formed an <reg orig="im-|portant">important</reg> <lb/>
part of the home life of the queen and her <lb/>
beloved husband, and, as a consequence, much <lb/>
more time was devoted to their study by the <lb/>
people during Victoria's reign than before, so <lb/>
that Britain may now be regarded as the home <lb/>
of culture.</p>
<p>The recent changes in our postal arrangements <lb/>
are yet fresh in our minds, but how many of us <lb/>
<pb n="24" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0035"/>
remember that only for sixty-three years have we <lb/>
enjoyed the privilege of the penny post?</p>
<p>It is not possible in this short sketch of the <lb/>
queen's life to speak of all the benefits we derived <lb/>
from her reign, while it would have been equally <lb/>
impossible not to have mentioned the leading ones.</p>
<p>At the time, then, of her Diamond Jubilee she <lb/>
was a very old lady, but still capable of holding <lb/>
the reins of government with keen intelligence. <lb/>
Under her guidance, many rough places in our <lb/>
dealings with other nations were made smooth, <lb/>
and, indeed, we do not know how much trouble was <lb/>
saved us, as a people, by her shrewd judgment <lb/>
and able advice.</p>
<p>One cannot help, therefore, regretting that the <lb/>
closing years of her useful life were saddened by <lb/>
the dread war in South Africa. At times there <lb/>
had been troubles in various parts of Africa, as also <lb/>
on the Indian Frontier, but never a war since the <lb/>
Crimean so long and destructive as the recent <lb/>
Transvaal War. With earnest and minute attention <lb/>
to every detail the aged queen followed the course <lb/>
of events, and none may ever know how our reverses, <lb/>
and consequent loss of life, wrung her heart.</p>
<p>She had always endeavoured to thank personally <lb/>
those who returned from active service in their <lb/>
country's cause, or from our many expeditions in <lb/>
the cause of right, even undertaking long and <lb/>
arduous journeys to comfort the sick and wounded <lb/>
in hospital, and herself place in their hands the <lb/>
medals they had so nobly won. Now, in her <lb/>
extreme old age, she actually paid a short visit to <lb/>
Ireland, in order to prove to her loyal subjects <lb/>
<pb n="25" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0036"/>
there how much she appreciated the heroic efforts <lb/>
of her brave Irish soldiers, who formed so <reg orig="im-|portant">important</reg> <lb/>
a part in her army.</p>
<p>She had been accustomed for many years to <lb/>
take an annual holiday abroad, but she could not <lb/>
go away and enjoy herself while her countrymen <lb/>
were dying in thousands for the honour and <lb/>
prestige of her Empire. So, when the time came, <lb/>
she just stayed at home and continued to watch <lb/>
with intense anxiety the course of events in the war.</p>
<p>But the strain and grief proved too much for her <lb/>
in the end. At the close of the year 1900 she went, <lb/>
as was her custom at that season, to stay for a <lb/>
while at Osborne House. Here she was kept in <lb/>
constant touch with all that was happening at the <lb/>
front, and one of her latest acts was to interview <lb/>
Lord Roberts on his return from the seat of war.</p>
<p>It almost seemed that she had lived but for this, <lb/>
for immediately afterwards grave rumours as to <lb/>
her health reached the people, and, in the evening <lb/>
of 22nd January 1901, she passed peacefully to <lb/>
that land "where the weary are at rest."</p>
</div2>

A Nation Mourning.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Perhaps</hi> no event of modern times has cast <lb/>
so great a gloom over the civilised world, <lb/>
as did the passing of Victoria the Good.</p>
<p>Messages of sympathy were sent to the bereaved <lb/>
family from all nations; cities and towns were <lb/>
<pb n="26" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0037"/>
draped with mourning, while for months <reg orig="after-|wards">afterwards</reg> <lb/>
her sorrowful subjects appeared clothed <lb/>
in that sombre colour associated with the death <lb/>
of one near and dear.</p>
<p>Their sorrow was deep and real, and though, <lb/>
among the myriads who thronged to see the <lb/>
funeral cort&ecirc;ge, there may have been some <lb/>
prompted by curiosity alone, it is at least safe <lb/>
to say that the great majority were there to pay <lb/>
a last tribute of reverence to one who had proved <lb/>
herself a truly wise and noble ruler.</p>
<p>As it was the queen's earnest wish to rest <lb/>
beside the husband she had never ceased to <lb/>
mourn, it was necessary to bring her body to <lb/>
the mainland.</p>
<p>It was borne from Osborne House to the Trinity <lb/>
Pier, East Cowes, on a gun-carriage drawn by <lb/>
eight ponies. The route was lined by soldiers, <lb/>
and a brilliant throng of kings, princes, and <lb/>
nobles, the queen and royal ladies, representatives <lb/>
of the army and navy, as well as a detachment <lb/>
of mounted local volunteers, accompanied it in <lb/>
mournful procession till the pier was reached.</p>
<p>No sound save the soft strains of the funeral <lb/>
march and the steady fall of the passing feet was <lb/>
heard. The spectators stood in reverent and deep <lb/>
sympathy as the royal mourners, with bowed <lb/>
heads, walked with measured steps down the <lb/>
hill which had been so long associated in their <lb/>
minds with the peaceful and happy life of their <lb/>
loved one.</p>
<p>At the Trinity Pier the coffin was put aboard <lb/>
the royal yacht, <hi rend="italic">Alberta</hi>, by a party of Blue <lb/>
<pb n="27" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0038"/>
Jackets, and the royal mourners joined the boats <lb/>
in which they were to accompany the <hi rend="italic">Alberta</hi> <lb/>
across the Solent.</p>
<p>The passage from Cowes to Portsmouth was <lb/>
lined on each side with ships of all nations, <reg orig="as-|sembled">assembled</reg> <lb/>
to do honour to the dead monarch, as <lb/>
she was borne for the last time from the island <lb/>
home, so fraught, for her, with the blessed <lb/>
memories of the past.</p>
<p>Next day the sad journey to London was made, <lb/>
and here the mourners were joined by <reg orig="represen-|tatives">representatives</reg> <lb/>
of all nations. The solemn and imposing <lb/>
pageant slowly wended its way through <reg orig="densely-|packed">densely-packed</reg> <lb/>
thoroughfares; for no business was <reg orig="con-|ducted">conducted</reg> <lb/>
that day, and a vast concourse of her <lb/>
sorrowing subjects had gathered to bid their <lb/>
beloved queen good-bye.</p>
<p>A solemn funeral service was held at Windsor, <lb/>
and, on Monday, 28th January, the body of the <lb/>
good queen was placed in the royal mausoleum <lb/>
at Frogmore.</p>
<p>Many things have happened since then, but <lb/>
Victoria still lives in the hearts of her people; and <lb/>
it is doubtful if any other monarch, however good, <lb/>
will ever hold quite the same place in their <reg orig="affec-|tion">affection</reg> <lb/>
as did the queen whom they had so long <lb/>
regarded as the highest type of true and good <lb/>
womanhood.</p>

Childhood.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Some</hi> eighty odd years ago the rector of <lb/>
Hauxwell, a lonely village near Richmond, <lb/>
in the North Riding of Yorkshire, was the <lb/>
Rev. Mark James Pattison, a man of much <reg orig="learn-|ing">learning</reg>, <lb/>
and descended <lb/>
from a very old <lb/>
Devonshire family. <lb/>
The rectory, a <reg orig="charm-|ing">charming</reg> <lb/>
house not far <lb/>
from the church, was <lb/>
perhaps one of the <lb/>
happiest homesteads <lb/>
in that remote little <lb/>
parish.</p>
<figure id="f2" rend="inline" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0039"/>
<p>All day long, laugh <lb/>
and song and the <lb/>
patter of childish feet could be heard within its <lb/>
walls, and of the little Pattisons perhaps the <lb/>
gayest and most winsome was Dorothy. The <lb/>
children were carefully trained by their parents <lb/>
to be kind and helpful to those in need, to be <lb/>
obedient and dutiful at home, and courteous to all.</p>
<p>Now Dorothy, as a young child, being far from <lb/>
strong, was never given any regular instruction, <lb/>
but, being most observant, she <hi rend="italic">thought</hi> about all <lb/>
that she saw, and thus learned much more than <lb/>
might have been expected. These thoughtful <lb/>
<pb n="29" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0040"/>
moods were noticeable only when Dorothy was <lb/>
not feeling well, for at other times she was full <lb/>
of fun and frolic, and never so happy as when <lb/>
devising some bit of mischief.</p>
<p>One point in her character became clear when <lb/>
she was still young. If she made up her mind <lb/>
to do a certain thing, nothing turned her from her <lb/>
purpose; she made no fuss when opposed, but, in <lb/>
a quiet way, managed to attain her end.</p>
<p>Many children would have been very much <lb/>
cast down by so much illness; but Dorothy <lb/>
Pattison had the happy faculty of always looking <lb/>
on the bright side of things, so that an illness <lb/>
over was soon forgotten. When about fourteen <lb/>
years of age, she was so dangerously ill that it <lb/>
was a long time before she fully recovered.</p>
<p>During this time she suffered intense pain, but <lb/>
she bore it with so much patience and sweetness as <lb/>
to win golden opinions from her nurses. The <reg orig="self-|control">self-control</reg> <lb/>
and power of endurance thus early shown <lb/>
she retained to the end of her life, and there is no <lb/>
doubt that these characteristics helped her through <lb/>
trials which repelled those unfortunate enough to <lb/>
lack them.</p>
<p>From this time Dorothy's health improved <lb/>
wonderfully, and she was able to take her share <lb/>
of the duties that all the Pattison children were <lb/>
taught they owed to their poorer neighbours. <lb/>
Fortunately, they had the means to do a great <lb/>
deal of good, for their mother was the daughter <lb/>
of a Richmond banker, named Winn, whose <lb/>
family was noted for great liberality.</p>
<p>Dorothy and her sisters felt that to give away <lb/>
<pb n="30" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0041"/>
what needed no sacrifice on their part was not <lb/>
true giving; so they frequently wore their clothes <lb/>
till quite shabby in order to give the money thus <lb/>
saved to the poor. It is also said that they <lb/>
sometimes ate bread and cheese themselves so as <lb/>
to give their good dinners to others. It was a <lb/>
common thing to see them carrying tins of hot <lb/>
soup to the poor cottagers in the winter-time. <lb/>
Indeed, they spared neither bodily effort nor <lb/>
power of mind, in their anxiety to do good, and <lb/>
the people of the village grew to love them.</p>
<p>Once, when Dorothy was away from home, one <lb/>
of the village boys fell ill with typhoid fever. His <lb/>
one wish was to see "Miss Dora," as he called her, <lb/>
and the poor child listened anxiously every day <lb/>
for her carriage wheels. At last she came, and he <lb/>
was the first to hear her. "There's Miss Dora! <lb/>
There she is!" he cried, and, exhausted by the <lb/>
effort, fell back on his pillow.</p>
<p>She went to him at once and remained to the <lb/>
end, nursing him with loving care, and cheering <lb/>
him with her bright smile and comforting words. <lb/>
This was the first time she had done anything of <lb/>
the sort, and even then she was more influenced by <lb/>
the desire to be kind than by the child's suffering.</p>
<p>She was now growing tall and strong like her <lb/>
father, and beautiful of face like her mother. <lb/>
She delighted in games of all kinds, but <reg orig="par-|ticularly">particularly</reg> <lb/>
those best suited to boys. Nothing <lb/>
gave her so much pleasure as a good gallop <lb/>
across the moors, or a ride to hounds with her <lb/>
brothers. Whatever she did, whether work or <lb/>
play, she did with her whole heart: there were <lb/>
<pb n="31" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0042"/>
no half measures with Dorothy Pattison; if a <lb/>
thing were worth doing, she did it well.</p>
<p>Having a fine voice and a great love for music, <lb/>
she undertook to train the village choir; and, in <lb/>
later years, she comforted many a poor sufferer by <lb/>
singing as she bustled about her many duties. <lb/>
An old friend describes her as "a bright, bonnie <lb/>
maiden, singing about the house." So she grew <lb/>
up to be a cheerful, active, shrewd woman, <lb/>
resolute, steadfast of purpose, and, above all, kind, <lb/>
thoughtful, and sympathetic, with the enviable <lb/>
faculty of forgetting herself in the good of others.</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="II" id="d17">
<head><hi rend="bold">CHAPTER II. <lb/>
First Efforts.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">It</hi> was not at all likely that so energetic a girl <lb/>
as Dorothy Pattison could long be satisfied <lb/>
with the placid inactivity of her quiet home. <lb/>
She seemed now to fully realise the amount of <lb/>
human suffering there is in the world, and <lb/>
longed with an intense yearning to do <reg orig="some-|thing">something</reg> <lb/>
to relieve it. It is not, therefore, surprising <lb/>
that she earnestly desired to join the band of <lb/>
devoted women who accompanied Miss Florence <lb/>
Nightingale to the Crimea.</p>
<p>Hitherto she had never shown any wish to <lb/>
nurse the sick, nor was it apparent that she had <lb/>
any special ability to do so, while it was quite <lb/>
certain that she had neither training nor <reg orig="experi-|ence">experience</reg> <lb/>
in such work. Her father pointed all this <lb/>
<pb n="32" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0043"/>
out to her, advising her to do her duty at home <lb/>
and she would have little time to spare.</p>
<p>In this he was right, for her mother, being now <lb/>
an invalid, needed a great deal of attention; and <lb/>
so Dorothy quietly took her share of the nursing, <lb/>
and was so bright and happy about the house <lb/>
that her father called her his "sunshine." Yet <lb/>
all the while, in her steadfast way, she never <reg orig="for-|sook">forsook</reg> <lb/>
her purpose. Occasionally she visited her <lb/>
elder brother, Mark, at Lincoln College, Oxford, <lb/>
proving herself both useful and entertaining, and <lb/>
from him she learned much that went toward <lb/>
making her the noble woman whose memory we <lb/>
hold so sacred.</p>
<p>In the year 1861 her mother died, and Dorothy, <lb/>
having now no place in her home which she felt <lb/>
obliged to fill, was once more consumed with the <lb/>
desire to do her share in the world's work. She <lb/>
had felt much drawn toward a certain sisterhood <lb/>
of Good Samaritans, who, among other charitable <lb/>
works, conducted a convalescent home at Coatham, <lb/>
near Redcar in Yorkshire.</p>
<p>Finding that her father had a very strong <lb/>
objection to her joining the sisterhood, she <lb/>
refrained at that time from doing so, although <lb/>
thoroughly determined that some useful work she <lb/>
must and would find. A mistress was needed for <lb/>
the village school at Woolston, in <reg orig="Buckingham-|shire">Buckinghamshire</reg>, <lb/>
and this post Dorothy Pattison offered to <lb/>
fill. Her father did not take kindly to the idea, <lb/>
and told her that he should only continue her <lb/>
usual allowance of money.</p>
<p>This, however, did not turn her from her purpose, <lb/>
<pb n="33" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0044"/>
and so, in order to have something to spare for <lb/>
those in need, she managed to do all but the very <lb/>
heaviest of the work of her little cottage herself.</p>
<p>At Woolston she soon won the affection and <lb/>
esteem not only of the children she taught, but <lb/>
also of the inhabitants of the village: and here <lb/>
she began that self-sacrifice which marked the <lb/>
whole of her after-life. During the three years <lb/>
spent at Woolston she proved herself not only <lb/>
an earnest, lovable schoolmistress, but a friend <lb/>
to anyone in need of such.</p>
<p>In fact she worked so hard, teaching by day and <lb/>
nursing the sick by night, that her health gave <lb/>
way. She became low-spirited and filled with the <lb/>
thought that she was not doing enough for those <lb/>
around her. This weakness and depression ended <lb/>
in a sharp attack of pleurisy, and, as soon as she <lb/>
was well enough to travel, she went to Redcar to <lb/>
recover her strength. Her sympathy with the <lb/>
work of the sisterhood revived, and Dorothy now <lb/>
resolved to join the Good Samaritans.</p>
<p>Her family knew well that the necessary <reg orig="restric-|tions">restrictions</reg> <lb/>
of such a body would not suit Dorothy's <lb/>
temperament, but all their persuasions availed <lb/>
nothing; she had made up her mind to join, <lb/>
and join she would and did, only to prove in <lb/>
time that her friends knew her better than she <lb/>
knew herself. Yet so attentively and intelligently <lb/>
did she perform all the duties required of her, that <lb/>
none even guessed she had made a mistake.</p>
<p>Her sweet graciousness of manner, sunny smile, <lb/>
and earnest devotion to duty soon won for "Sister <lb/>
Dora," as she was now called, the love of all with <lb/>
<pb n="34" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0045"/>
whom she came in contact. Her first knowledge <lb/>
of hospital work was gained at North Ormesby, <lb/>
Yorkshire; but in 1865 she was sent to Walsall, <lb/>
in South Staffordshire, where she shortly <reg orig="after-|wards">afterwards</reg> <lb/>
found her life's work.</p>
<p>The cottage hospital in this town had been <lb/>
established about a year, and during that time <lb/>
had been conducted by the sisterhood of Good <lb/>
Samaritans in the face of the most obstinate <lb/>
opposition of the people whom it was meant to <lb/>
benefit. They had an intense dislike of Roman <lb/>
Catholicism, to which faith they believed the sisters <lb/>
belonged, and showed it in a very unmistakable <lb/>
way. Sister Dora was, perhaps, the last to suffer <lb/>
from their active opposition.</p>
<p>While walking along a street one day a lad threw <lb/>
a stone at her, making a nasty cut on her forehead. <lb/>
Now Sister Dora, having once seen a face, never <lb/>
forgot it; and so it happened that when one day, <lb/>
some time later, this same lad was taken into the <lb/>
hospital seriously hurt, she knew him at once. <lb/>
All the skill at her command, and the care and <lb/>
loving attention of which she was capable, she <lb/>
lavished upon him; and so utterly ashamed of <lb/>
his brutality toward her did the lad feel, that he <lb/>
was not happy till he had confessed his fault and <lb/>
obtained her forgiveness</p>

The Friend of the People.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Sister dora</hi> now returned to Coatham, and <lb/>
was shortly afterwards chosen by an eminent <lb/>
physician to take charge of a most difficult <lb/>
case. The patient was an eccentric old lady, who, <lb/>
becoming very much attached to her nurse, wished <lb/>
to make her some very valuable presents. These <lb/>
were at first graciously but firmly refused, but <lb/>
finding that this vexed her patient greatly, Sister <lb/>
Dora afterwards took them from her and then <lb/>
secretly restored them to the family. Upon the <lb/>
death of this old lady Sister Dora returned to <lb/>
Walsall, where, with few intervals, she continued <lb/>
to work for thirteen years.</p>
<p>She suited the doctors so well that they begged <lb/>
the sisters to be allowed to keep her altogether; but <lb/>
this they were not disposed to do. She was ordered <lb/>
to go at once to Devonshire, to nurse a private <lb/>
patient; but, before starting, she received news <lb/>
that her father was dangerously ill, and wished <lb/>
to see her very much. On applying for leave to <lb/>
go home, the sisters replied that her orders were <lb/>
to proceed immediately to Devonshire, which she <lb/>
did with a very sore heart.</p>
<p>On arriving, news reached her that her father <lb/>
was dead, and that it was her duty to attend the <lb/>
funeral. Permission to do so came from Coatham; <lb/>
but Sister Dora felt that as she had not been <lb/>
allowed to see her father while still alive, she had <lb/>
<pb n="36" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0047"/>
no desire to avail herself of such permission. She <lb/>
therefore diligently fulfilled the duties required of <lb/>
her until she was no longer needed, when she once <lb/>
more returned to Walsall.</p>
<p>From this time she ceased to take any deep <lb/>
interest in the sisterhood of Good Samaritans, <lb/>
though she remained one of them for some years <lb/>
longer. She now set herself to study diligently <lb/>
all the details of her profession, and so great was <lb/>
her earnestness and intelligence that she attracted <lb/>
the attention of an old doctor, who taught her <lb/>
all he knew of surgery.</p>
<p>She eventually became not only a skilful surgeon <lb/>
but a successful one, for she inspired her patients <lb/>
with such unbounded confidence in her power to <lb/>
heal them, that they willingly agreed to all she <lb/>
suggested.</p>
<p>The employment of the people of this district <lb/>
being very productive of accidents to the eye, she <lb/>
determined to take a course of lectures at the <lb/>
Ophthalmic Hospital, Birmingham, so as to be <lb/>
able to deal with such cases. There was no <lb/>
resident surgeon in the Walsall hospital, and so it <lb/>
fell to Sister Dora to treat all casualties brought <lb/>
in; and this was one reason why she was so <lb/>
anxious to learn all that could possibly help in <lb/>
the immediate alleviation of pain. So thorough <lb/>
a knowledge of both theoretical and practical <lb/>
surgery did she at last obtain that she was <reg orig="con-|sidered">considered</reg> <lb/>
to be much cleverer than many ordinary <lb/>
doctors.</p>
<p>And all this time she was fighting inward <lb/>
battles with herself&mdash;battles in which self-pleasing <lb/>
<pb n="37" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0048"/>
and self-abnegation were strongly opposed. Should <lb/>
she, forgetting all that a home of her own and <lb/>
the society of cultivated people would be to her, <lb/>
continue the work she had begun so well, and <lb/>
devote the whole of her life to the needs of the <lb/>
sick, the poor, and the friendless?</p>
<p>Would she have sufficient strength of mind to <lb/>
withstand future temptation of similar kind, or <lb/>
should she, by joining a stricter sisterhood, remove <lb/>
herself beyond the power of such temptation?</p>
<p>In her difficulty she sought the advice of an <lb/>
old friend, who pointed out to her how peculiarly <lb/>
suited she was to the work she had undertaken, <lb/>
and that he thought she would certainly find her <lb/>
chief happiness in promoting the welfare of those <lb/>
suffering ones to whom her heart had really been <lb/>
given, rather than in yielding to a passing fancy <lb/>
which would, all too soon, prove unsatisfying to a <lb/>
nature such as hers.</p>
<p>So, in her quiet, purposeful manner, she <reg orig="con-|tinued">continued</reg> <lb/>
her hospital work until, in 1866, she had a <lb/>
very serious illness. Then the people realised all <lb/>
that she had become to them; they felt that she <lb/>
was <hi rend="italic">their</hi> friend, and they could not spare her. <lb/>
Who but Sister Dora would come to them at any <lb/>
hour of the night to set a broken limb, to bandage <lb/>
a gaping wound, to soothe a riotous drunkard, or <lb/>
comfort the last moments of the dying?</p>
<p>Many anxious inquiries were made at the door <lb/>
of the hospital, and prayers were offered on her <lb/>
behalf at the church of St. James, Wednesbury.</p>
<p>Now Sister Dora had an almost superstitious <lb/>
belief in the power of prayer, and so she liked to <lb/>
<pb n="38" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0049"/>
think that her recovery was due to these petitions <lb/>
of the people, and she loved them even more than <lb/>
before.</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="IV" id="d19">
<head><hi rend="bold">CHAPTER IV. <lb/>
A Few of the Actions that Won their Hearts.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> hospital committee now decided to erect <lb/>
a new building, as the old one was not only <lb/>
too small for the needs of the people but <lb/>
was very badly placed for purposes of ventilation. <lb/>
Sister Dora gave a good contribution towards the <lb/>
expenses, and the rest of the money was soon <lb/>
obtained. A site was chosen on the hill on <lb/>
which the parish church stands; the work went <lb/>
steadily forward, and, in 1868, the new hospital <lb/>
was ready.</p>
<p>It was divided into three wards, and contained <lb/>
twenty-eight beds&mdash;with convenience for more, if <lb/>
needed&mdash;good accommodation for out-door patients, <lb/>
and every appliance known at that time. It was <lb/>
so arranged that one active person could manage <lb/>
the whole of the nursing, and this Sister Dora did.</p>
<p>She washed the patients, made their beds, dressed <lb/>
their wounds, fed them, sewed for them, read to <lb/>
them, played games with them in her rare intervals <lb/>
of leisure, and never omitted prayers even on the <lb/>
busiest mornings, standing in such a position that <lb/>
the patients in all the wards could hear her. She <lb/>
taught them to go to God in all their trials, and <lb/>
impressed on their minds that if they really had <lb/>
faith. He would grant their requests.</p>
<pb n="39" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0050"/>
<p>She was never wearied by their wants, and waited <lb/>
upon them as willingly by night as by day. Her <lb/>
sunny smile, her winsome manner, her ever-present <lb/>
cheeriness and ready sympathy helped greatly <lb/>
toward the recovery of many of the poor sufferers <lb/>
under her care. One man said of her, "Make <lb/>
you laugh? She'd make you laugh if you were <lb/>
dying!"</p>
<p>Many of the poor men sought to relieve their <lb/>
feelings, when in great pain, by using bad <lb/>
language, but this Sister Dora would by no means <lb/>
allow. "Stop that!" she would say; "if you <lb/>
really must say something, say <hi rend="italic">poker and tongs!</hi>" <lb/>
Then looking round with a bright face, she would <lb/>
add, "Now remember, nothing but <hi rend="italic">poker and <lb/>
tongs!</hi>" and away she would go, feeling confident <lb/>
that she would be obeyed.</p>
<p>Just at this time small-pox broke out in the town <lb/>
and spread rapidly, so that Sister Dora had plenty <lb/>
to do outside the hospital. She never refused to <lb/>
attend a case, and the more loathsome it was the <lb/>
more readily did she render help. One night she <lb/>
was sent for to a man who was dying of the <reg orig="black-|pox">black-pox</reg>. <lb/>
His wife and friends had all deserted him, <lb/>
and he was alone in a house situated in one of <lb/>
the worst slums of the town.</p>
<p>On reaching the wretched dwelling she found <lb/>
that there was but one small piece of candle left; <lb/>
so she gave a woman some money to buy some <lb/>
more for her. The woman failed to bring the <lb/>
candles, and so the good sister sat the whole of <lb/>
the night alone and in darkness with the poor <lb/>
diseased and dying man.</p>
<pb n="40" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0051"/>
<p>Once during the long hours he said to her, <lb/>
"Kiss me before I die, sister!" and, putting her <lb/>
arms around the poor fellow, heedless of disease, <lb/>
she granted his last request. Shortly afterwards <lb/>
he passed peacefully away, but still she sat on, <lb/>
until, when the dawn broke, she called in some <lb/>
neighbours and returned to the hospital.</p>
<p>About this time an old servant of the Pattison <lb/>
family went to help Sister Dora in her work, and <lb/>
soon became very useful both in managing the <lb/>
domestic arrangements and in nursing.</p>
<p>Some of the patients taken into the institution <lb/>
were terribly crushed by explosions in mines and <lb/>
accidents with machinery&mdash;so much so that it was <lb/>
often found necessary to take off a limb as a last <lb/>
means of saving life. Now these poor men did not <lb/>
at all like the idea of amputation, and a great deal <lb/>
of persuasion was needed to gain their consent to <lb/>
such an operation. This usually fell to Sister <lb/>
Dora, for few could resist her charm of manner <lb/>
and quiet though sensible reasoning.</p>
<p>On one occasion, however, she strongly objected <lb/>
to the removal of the arm of a fine young fellow <lb/>
who had met with a terrible accident. His right <lb/>
arm was twisted and torn dreadfully, but Sister <lb/>
Dora's keen eye saw a chance of saving it, and <lb/>
she said so. The doctor found it impossible to <lb/>
agree with her, and, after a time, gave up the case <lb/>
entirely.</p>
<p>The whole responsibility was now undertaken by <lb/>
Sister Dora, and it is very certain that she spent <lb/>
some very anxious days until the result proved that <lb/>
her idea had been a true one. She saved the arm, <lb/>
<pb n="41" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0052"/>
and with most pardonable pride fetched the doctor <lb/>
to see it, at the end of a fortnight. His <reg orig="astonish-|ment">astonishment</reg> <lb/>
was unbounded, and it is but fair to him <lb/>
to say that he was as pleased as if the credit had <lb/>
been his own.</p>
<p>The young fellow ever afterward called that arm <lb/>
"Sister's arm," and so attached was he to the <lb/>
clever woman who had done so much for him, that <lb/>
some time later, when she was very ill, he walked <lb/>
eleven miles into Walsall every Sunday to inquire <lb/>
for her. Before leaving he always said to the <lb/>
servant, "Tell sister that was <hi rend="italic">her</hi> arm that rang <lb/>
the bell!"</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="V" id="d20">
<head><hi rend="bold">CHAPTER V. <lb/>
Her Influence over the People.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Some</hi> of the greatest battles Sister Dora fought <lb/>
were against bad language and drunkenness. <lb/>
Big brawny men hung their heads at her <lb/>
rebuke; coarse jest and foul words died on the <lb/>
lips at her approach; even the poor misguided <lb/>
drunkard tried to straighten himself and walk as <lb/>
a man if she were near.</p>
<p>Alone, at the dead of night, in the lowest <lb/>
slums of the town she walked without fear&mdash;a <lb/>
woman such as those poor degraded people had <lb/>
never before dreamed of. They believed in her <lb/>
and they loved her; and they were right in doing <lb/>
so, for she gave them all of her best, and none <lb/>
could do more.</p>
<p>Many men and women left the hospital resolved <lb/>
<pb n="42" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0053"/>
upon leading better lives for her sake, and to <lb/>
many such she gave ample means of beginning <lb/>
over again in a new world, far removed from <lb/>
old associations and temptations.</p>
<p>The outbreak of war between France and <lb/>
Germany again made her feel that among the <lb/>
wounded and the dying on the stricken field of <lb/>
battle she could find even more to do for God than <lb/>
in Walsall, but, happily for that town, the feeling <lb/>
passed; she found it impossible to leave the people <lb/>
to whom she had grown so dear, and whom she <lb/>
loved with all the depth of her large heart.</p>
<p>Among the convalescents in the hospital she had <lb/>
ever one who hung on her slightest wish, and I <lb/>
feel sure you will be interested to hear about him. <lb/>
He was a poor little fellow of ten, named Sam. He <lb/>
was more than ordinarily sharp and observant, so <lb/>
that, after a time, he was able to prepare for Sister <lb/>
Dora all that she would need in ordinary cases.</p>
<p>One morning he was suffering such intense pain <lb/>
that he felt unable to leave his bed. The poor <lb/>
child hid his head beneath the clothes, that Sister <lb/>
Dora should not be worried by the tears he could <lb/>
not restrain. She knew all about it, however, and, <lb/>
in a little while, she said aloud to another patient, <lb/>
"Tell Sam I <hi rend="italic">do</hi> miss him!" Instantly the trouble <lb/>
left the dear boy's face, and, having dressed <reg orig="him-|self">himself</reg>, <lb/>
he went to help the sister as brightly as if <lb/>
there were no such thing as pain in all the world.</p>
<p>Sometimes, looking, very gravely at him, she <lb/>
would say, in reference to a wound she was <lb/>
treating, "Now, doctor, what would you do in this <lb/>
case?" and, quite as gravely, Sam would reply, <lb/>
<pb entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0054"/>
<pb entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0055"/>
<figure id="f3" rend="page" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0055"/>
<pb n="43" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0056"/>
"Zinc ointment!" or any other remedy he knew <lb/>
from experience she would be likely to use.</p>
<p>Sister Dora's winsome way with children <lb/>
especially was delightful to see. Poor little mites <lb/>
badly scalded, and brought to her for help, held out <lb/>
their tiny arms and nestled against her bosom as <lb/>
soon as they saw her, and many a sorrowing <lb/>
mother returned to her wretched home with the <lb/>
full assurance that all that human skill and <lb/>
womanly love could do for her suffering child <lb/>
would be done by that great-hearted, capable <lb/>
woman, Sister Dora.</p>
<p>The miserable, neglected little children of the <lb/>
courts and alleys ran smiling to her, knowing well <lb/>
that <hi rend="italic">Sister</hi> would have a kiss for them. She was, <lb/>
indeed, a <hi rend="italic">sister</hi> to them, and much more, for one <lb/>
of her humble friends said of her, after her death, <lb/>
that she was as like the Lord Jesus Christ as any <lb/>
human creature could be.</p>
<p>One day a dear little girl was brought into the <lb/>
hospital suffering from such dreadful burns that <lb/>
she could not possibly recover. So Sister Dora <lb/>
sat down by the child's bed and told her pretty <lb/>
stories of Heaven and Jesus and the happy angels, <lb/>
until, looking sweetly into the good sister's face, <lb/>
the poor little child said, "When you come to <lb/>
heaven, sister, I will meet you at the gate with <lb/>
a bunch of flowers."</p>
<p>Many of the local railway-men owed both life <lb/>
and limb to her skill, and so, as a token of <lb/>
esteem they bought and presented to her a small <lb/>
carriage and pony. She was greatly touched by <lb/>
their thoughtfulness; and she found the carriage <lb/>
<pb n="44" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0057"/>
very useful, not only in taking convalescent <lb/>
patients for drives into the country, but also in <lb/>
saving time in her many errands of mercy <reg orig="out-|side">outside</reg> <lb/>
the hospital.</p>
<p>In the autumn of the year 1874 her connection <lb/>
with the sisters of the <hi rend="italic">Good Samaritans</hi> ceased. <lb/>
From this time Sister Dora's one great wish <lb/>
was to establish a convalescent home for her <lb/>
patients on the north coast of Wales, as she firmly <lb/>
believed in the healing powers of sea air and <lb/>
bathing, when possible. Such a home now <lb/>
actually exists at Abergele, though unhappily <lb/>
Sister Dora did not live to see it. She was very <lb/>
fond of the water herself, and it is said that during <lb/>
one of her visits to Redcar she saved a woman <lb/>
from drowning by swimming out to her and <lb/>
holding her head above water till help came.</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="VI" id="d21">
<head><hi rend="bold">CHAPTER VI. <lb/>
Her Management of the Epidemic Hospital.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">After</hi> the last outbreak of small-pox the <lb/>
hospital committee erected an isolation <lb/>
building outside the town, but, when in <lb/>
1875 the disease again appeared, the people <lb/>
absolutely refused to go there. At length Sister <lb/>
Dora wrote to the mayor, offering to take charge <lb/>
of the isolated hospital, and you may be quite <lb/>
sure that her offer was joyfully accepted.</p>
<p>As soon as the people heard that <hi rend="italic">sister</hi> would <lb/>
nurse them, they went readily enough to the <lb/>
<pb n="45" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0058"/>
hospital, and so firm a hold had the disease now <lb/>
obtained that all the beds were soon full. Then it <lb/>
was that Dorothy Pattison thanked God with all <lb/>
her heart for the strength and power of endurance <lb/>
He had given her&mdash;for both were tried to the very <lb/>
utmost.</p>
<p>With none but two old women from the <reg orig="work-|house">work-house</reg> <lb/>
to help with the washing, and an old man to <lb/>
act as porter, she did the whole of the work of <lb/>
nursing, washing, cooking for and feeding <reg orig="twenty-|eight">twenty-eight</reg> <lb/>
patients in every stage of the disease. In many <lb/>
cases she was obliged even to make clothes for them; <lb/>
and the babies were a source of constant labour.</p>
<p>Yet her native cheerfulness never forsook her, <lb/>
for in one letter she says, "You would laugh to <lb/>
see me washing my babies. Poor things! they <lb/>
are getting quite fond of me; but they do make <lb/>
some washing!" Yet, in spite of her many <lb/>
duties, she found "time and opportunity to <lb/>
spread the glad tidings to many an ignorant <lb/>
soul;" and she thanked God for her daily life <lb/>
in that abode of disease and death.</p>
<p>When the last patient left the epidemic hospital, <lb/>
some six months later, she returned to the scene of <lb/>
her former labours, and shortly afterwards one of <lb/>
the most fearful accidents the town has ever known <lb/>
occurred in Walsall. An explosion took place at <lb/>
some ironworks near by, and eleven men were <lb/>
literally covered with molten metal.</p>
<p>Hoping to ease their agony they jumped into <lb/>
a canal close at hand, and were rescued with the <lb/>
greatest difficulty. A ward was soon cleared at <lb/>
the hospital for their reception, and then began <lb/>
<pb n="46" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0059"/>
such a labour of mercy that many a strong man and <lb/>
woman was forced to turn from it, sick and faint.</p>
<p>So ghastly were the wounds of the poor fellows <lb/>
that even Sister Dora could not manage without <lb/>
taking a little brandy as a stimulant. For ten <lb/>
days and nights did this brave woman battle with <lb/>
death, and, in the end, was successful in saving <lb/>
the lives of two of the unfortunate sufferers. One <lb/>
of these two in speaking of her says: "She was <lb/>
with us almost night and day. It did you good <lb/>
only to look at her. What we felt for her I <lb/>
couldn't tell you, my tongue won't say it."</p>
<p>The ward in which these poor men had lain was <lb/>
so full of poisonous germs that no wounds would <lb/>
thereafter heal in it. The committee, therefore, <lb/>
determined to build a new and larger hospital. <lb/>
A temporary building was taken, sufficiently large <lb/>
to hold twelve beds, with very scanty <reg orig="accommoda-|tion">accommodation</reg> <lb/>
for the nursing staff, and none for out-patients, <lb/>
who were therefore obliged to receive attention at <lb/>
their old quarters in the condemned hospital.</p>
<p>In 1876 Sister Dora did a great deal of good <lb/>
work among the poor outcast women of the town. <lb/>
A mission was being held, and she added largely <lb/>
to its success by personally conducting the <lb/>
missionaries into the worst haunts of sin and <lb/>
misery. They could never have reached these <lb/>
people alone, for it would have been more than <lb/>
their lives were worth to have ventured into such <lb/>
districts without the protecting care of the woman <lb/>
whom even the vilest men revered.</p>
<p>In the winter of 1877 she discovered that she was <lb/>
suffering from a disease which must end fatally. <lb/>
<pb n="47" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0060"/>
Binding her medical adviser to secrecy, she <reg orig="con-|tinued">continued</reg> <lb/>
her labours of love, to all appearance just <lb/>
as strong and healthy as ever. The following <lb/>
Christmas she determined to give her people such <lb/>
a happy time that they would never forget it, for <lb/>
she felt sure that it was her last chance of seeing <lb/>
them thoroughly enjoying themselves.</p>
<p>She threw herself heartily into their games; and <lb/>
no one to look at her could have guessed that the <lb/>
tall, handsome woman would, almost inevitably, <lb/>
pass from the scene of her earthly efforts, to take <lb/>
her share of joy in the kingdom above ere another <lb/>
Christmas Day had dawned.</p>
<p>Knowing how short her time was, she worked <lb/>
with a restless activity that astounded even the <lb/>
hospital committee, accustomed as they were to <lb/>
her untiring energy. She now found her little <lb/>
carriage most useful, for she was frequently called <lb/>
to places quite ten miles from the town.</p>
<p>One night as the old porter was driving her along <lb/>
a quiet country road, a man sprang out of the hedge, <lb/>
and, coming up behind, struck at Sister Dora with <lb/>
a heavy stick. She swerved her head aside just in <lb/>
time to save herself, while the ruffian, hearing the <lb/>
sound of horse-hoofs approaching, made off quickly.</p>
<p>This was but one of the adventures with which <lb/>
she met. But the old porter always said that the <lb/>
man must have been a stranger, for he knew that <lb/>
no Walsall man would touch Sister Dora to do her <lb/>
any harm; and I think he was right. Nothing <lb/>
daunted her, however, and she continued her <reg orig="mid-|night">midnight</reg> <lb/>
journeys as usual, for she had really no time <lb/>
during the day to spare outside the town.</p>

<head><hi rend="bold">CHAPTER VII. <lb/>
Sister Dora's Last Efforts.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> disease had now become so painful that <lb/>
Sister Dora was obliged to consult a <reg orig="Birming-|ham">Birmingham</reg> <lb/>
doctor, in whose opinion she had implicit <lb/>
confidence. From him she learned that the dread <lb/>
cancer had now reached that stage which needed <lb/>
surgical treatment. True to her determination to <lb/>
let none know of her trouble till it was impossible <lb/>
longer to conceal it, she bravely dressed the wound <lb/>
herself and resumed her duties.</p>
<p>Just at this time she was asked by a doctor to <lb/>
assist at an operation on the throat of a child <lb/>
suffering from diphtheria. An incision was made <lb/>
and a silver tube inserted to enable the child to <lb/>
breathe more freely. The little throat was filled <lb/>
with poisonous mucus, and Sister Dora, kneeling <lb/>
beside the child, actually sucked the deadly matter <lb/>
through the incision! The patient recovered from <lb/>
that illness, but at the cost of three weeks' acute <lb/>
suffering to the brave sister.</p>
<p>In June, 1878, upon returning from a short <lb/>
holiday, Sister Dora found it necessary to close <lb/>
the temporary hospital, owing to an outbreak of <lb/>
typhoid fever. The new building not being <lb/>
finished, she decided to have a good long rest <lb/>
among her friends; but, before starting, she took <lb/>
all her old patients and the hospital staff for an <lb/>
outing to Lichfield. She had taken them on many <lb/>
such trips before, but all agreed that they had <lb/>
<pb n="49" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0062"/>
never seen her so utterly happy and gay as she <lb/>
was on that particular occasion.</p>
<p>Her nieces, too, with whom she afterwards went <lb/>
to stay, remarked the same thing. She seemed <lb/>
even fuller of life than usual, teaching them to <lb/>
swim, and playing many a trick upon them while <lb/>
in the water, so that they had not the faintest idea <lb/>
that she was suffering from a disease that would <lb/>
soon prove fatal.</p>
<p>She next went to Paris, where she visited the <lb/>
Exhibition; afterwards returning to London, with <lb/>
the intention of attending a course of lectures on <lb/>
the treatment of wounds, by Professor Lister. <lb/>
Really she should have been quietly resting at <lb/>
home; for, during her stay in London, her pain <lb/>
increased so rapidly and her cough became so <lb/>
very troublesome, that it was patent to all she was <lb/>
suffering from some malignant form of disease.</p>
<p>Seeing that there was danger of her secret being <lb/>
discovered, she suddenly left London for <reg orig="Birming-|ham">Birmingham</reg>. <lb/>
Now, in her state at that time, such a journey <lb/>
was almost certain death; but, in spite of the grave <lb/>
fears of the doctor, she rallied sufficiently to be <lb/>
taken to Walsall&mdash;to die, as she herself wished, <lb/>
among her own people.</p>
<p>The hospital committee prepared a house for her <lb/>
reception, and an old servant was engaged to wait <lb/>
upon and nurse her; but, although the sad news of <lb/>
her illness spread rapidly in the town, no breath of <lb/>
the real trouble was allowed to get abroad. The <lb/>
people absolutely refused to believe that Sister <lb/>
Dora would never more minister to their needs; <lb/>
they seemed to think that she was a being superior <lb/>
<pb n="50" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0063"/>
to such things as sickness and death; but, when <lb/>
they fully realised the mournful truth, the whole <lb/>
town seemed utterly cast down.</p>
<p>She was now compelled to accept the help of <lb/>
Mrs.H., the old family servant who had been of <lb/>
so much use to her in the hospital, but it was with <lb/>
the greatest reluctance that Sister Dora confided the <lb/>
nature of her trouble even to her. She was gratified <lb/>
by the visits of her sisters, but would not hear of <lb/>
their remaining to nurse her, and it was with aching <lb/>
hearts that they returned to their homes.</p>
<p>Perhaps we may feel inclined to blame her for <lb/>
being so reticent with her own family, but, should <lb/>
it be so, let us remember that her whole life had <lb/>
been one of self-restraint and self-reliance. With <lb/>
an almost painful reluctance to admit that <reg orig="suffer-|ing">suffering</reg> <lb/>
could subdue even her proud spirit, she had <lb/>
striven to conceal her ailments till absolutely forced <lb/>
to give in; yet, all the while, she had secretly <lb/>
dreaded that she would most certainly fall a prey <lb/>
to one of the deadly diseases she had so frequently <lb/>
and successfully combated in others.</p>
<p>During the comparatively short time she was <lb/>
confined to her bed, her old cheeriness never <lb/>
deserted her; her sublime faith in God helped <lb/>
her even then to look on the bright side, for she <lb/>
says, in writing to a friend, "My heart is full of <lb/>
thankfulness for the Good Shepherd's care and <lb/>
tender love towards me. I have not a care; it is <lb/>
all sunshine. Oh, my dear, this peace does indeed <lb/>
pass all understanding. I have so longed to go <lb/>
home. I am so happy."</p>
<p>Although it was not possible for her to see the <lb/>
<pb n="51" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0064"/>
opening of the new hospital, she had the happiness <lb/>
of knowing it was finished and declared open, in <lb/>
her name, on 14th November 1878. It was a <lb/>
great day to her; she received many visitors, and <lb/>
was saved all anxiety as to the competent <reg orig="manage-|ment">management</reg> <lb/>
of the institution by the temporary <reg orig="appoint-|ment">appointment</reg> <lb/>
of an old pupil in whom she had every <lb/>
confidence.</p>

Sister Dora Wins her Crown of Life.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">It</hi> had been Sister Dora's custom to give to each <lb/>
cabman in the town some small gift every <lb/>
Christmas; but, fearing she would not be with <lb/>
them much longer, she gave them their presents of <lb/>
warm gloves, scarves, etc., in November, shortly <lb/>
after the opening of the new hospital.</p>
<p>That she should, in the midst of all her pain, <lb/>
so think of them, touched the men's hearts most <lb/>
deeply; and I have no doubt that many of these <lb/>
gifts are even now treasured as souvenirs of the <lb/>
giver, though the actual recipients needed nothing <lb/>
beyond the remembrance of years of steadfast <lb/>
devotion to them and their fellow townspeople <lb/>
to keep her memory ever green in their hearts.</p>
<p>On 24th December, 1878, she passed peacefully <lb/>
away, just in time to sing her Christmas song <lb/>
in heaven, as she so often wished. The muffled <lb/>
pealing of the church bells told the anxious people <lb/>
that the agonies of their loved one were over, and <lb/>
on the following Saturday she was laid to rest in <lb/>
<pb n="52" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0065"/>
the cemetery just beyond the town. The sad <lb/>
procession comprised members of the public <lb/>
bodies in the town, representatives of all <reg orig="pro-|fessions">professions</reg> <lb/>
and trades, bishops, clergy, and ministers <lb/>
of all denominations, in addition to hundreds and <lb/>
hundreds of people who had benefited by her skill <lb/>
and loving kindness.</p>
<p>For nearly two hours a dense crowd of all sorts <lb/>
and conditions of men, women, and children <lb/>
waited in the snow and the drizzling rain to <lb/>
see the last of her who had never failed them <lb/>
in their time of need. Tears streamed unchecked <lb/>
down the faces of rough men as the mournful <lb/>
cort&egrave;ge passed, and they gazed with uncovered <lb/>
heads upon that which contained all that was <lb/>
noble and good in womanhood to them.</p>
<p>It was in vain the police tried to check the people <lb/>
from crowding into the place of burial. Sister <lb/>
Dora was more dear to the little unwashed street <lb/>
children and the poor neglected slatternly women <lb/>
than any one else they had ever known, and they <lb/>
were there to do their last act of reverence to her <lb/>
who had shown them they had at least one friend <lb/>
in the world, and who had abundantly proved to <lb/>
them that they also had the greatest of all friends <lb/>
in heaven, the Lord Christ Jesus.</p>
<p>Though dead she yet speaks to many who knew <lb/>
and loved her; but, that her memory may live in <lb/>
the generations to come, the people have erected a <lb/>
life-sized statue of her in a prominent part of the <lb/>
town. In the hearts of the people of Walsall she <lb/>
is now, as she was nearly a quarter of a century <lb/>
ago, "<hi rend="italic">Our</hi> Sister Dora."</p>
<pb n="53" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0066"/>
<p>In the words of a minister of the town, who <lb/>
knew her well, they might also say: "Not only do <lb/>
we treasure her memory as that of a great and <lb/>
useful worker in the cause of suffering humanity, <lb/>
but for the higher reason, that we have had in her <lb/>
a style of character more sublime than any we have <lb/>
seen before, or, in these days, perhaps, hardly <lb/>
thought possible. Surely the most desirable <lb/>
image to us is that of the most perfect human <lb/>
soul, and, quite as surely, that image has dwelt <lb/>
and worked amongst us in Walsall."</p>
<p>The tomb of this noble woman is frequently <lb/>
visited by people desirous of paying a tribute of <lb/>
respect to the departed, and all are struck by its <lb/>
utter unobtrusiveness. So simple is the cross that <lb/>
marks the resting-place of the much-loving and <lb/>
much-loved sister, that many pass it by without <lb/>
even a glance.</p>
<p>The stranger, knowing her history, seeks some <lb/>
ponderous monument; but to such I would say, <lb/>
that, while her life was for many years lived <lb/>
before the public gaze, she was by nature modest <lb/>
and unassuming&mdash;never obtruding herself or her <lb/>
opinions unless assured that by so doing some <lb/>
fellow-being would be benefited.</p>
<p>No mention even of her life's work is made: the <lb/>
simple inscription being:&mdash;</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Mary carpenter</hi>, eldest daughter of Dr. <lb/>
Lant Carpenter, a man of great learning, <lb/>
well known in the early part of last century, <lb/>
was one of the most remarkable women of a <reg orig="remark-|able">remarkable</reg> <lb/>
age. <reg orig="Strong-|willed">Strong-willed</reg>, <lb/>
masterful, <lb/>
sensitive to a painful <lb/>
degree, self-reliant, <lb/>

affectionate, the <lb/>
girl became a woman <lb/>
of unusual strength of <lb/>
character and <reg orig="wonder-|ful">wonderful</reg> <lb/>
perseverance and <lb/>
endurance.</p>
<figure id="f4" rend="inline" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0067"/>
<p>Born on 3rd April, <lb/>
1807, she early showed signs of a desire to be useful <lb/>
&mdash;a desire which marked the whole of her long life. <lb/>
When Mary was ten years old, her father accepted <lb/>
the position of minister at the meeting-house in <lb/>
Lewin's Mead, one of the lowest neighbourhoods of <lb/>
Bristol, and it was perhaps due to this change that <lb/>
she became the greatest friend that the neglected <lb/>
children of the criminal classes have ever had.</p>
<p>Shortly after removing to Bristol, Dr. Carpenter <lb/>
decided to receive a certain number of pupils into <lb/>
<pb n="55" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0068"/>
his house to be educated with his own six children, <lb/>
three of whom were girls.</p>
<p>During her early girlhood, Mary was much <lb/>
troubled by a painful affection of the eyes, which <lb/>
threatened to have serious results. This greatly <lb/>
hindered her studies; but Mary soon made up <lb/>
for lost time, and became more than ordinarily <lb/>
proficient, not only in the usual subjects, but also <lb/>
in Latin, Greek, and mathematics.</p>
<p>One noticeable trait in the girl's character was <lb/>
her thoroughness&mdash;whatever she undertook she did <lb/>
as well as she possibly could; and this is the <lb/>
secret of the success attained by all these eminent <lb/>
women of whom we write. Perhaps they learned, <lb/>
as most of us do, the old rhyme:&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"All that you do, do with your might;</l>
<l>Things done by halves are never done right."</l>
</lg></q>
They, however, did what some of us do not do&mdash; <lb/>
they lived up to it; and that is why we hear of <lb/>
them to-day; that is why little children, and big <lb/>
ones too, for that matter, will hear about them <lb/>
when the millions of other women who lived at <lb/>
the same time will have been forgotten.</p>
<p>As Mary grew older she helped her father in <lb/>
his Sunday-school, and, later on, noticing how very <lb/>
much overworked he was, she resolved to fit <reg orig="her-|self">herself</reg> <lb/>
for the task of relieving him of the work in his <lb/>
private school. When the time came, however, <lb/>
that Dr. Carpenter was obliged to take a <reg orig="much-|needed">much-needed</reg> <lb/>
rest, the management of both home and <lb/>
school was undertaken by Mrs. Carpenter and her <lb/>
daughter Anna.</p>
<pb n="56" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0069"/>
<p>Mary therefore decided to accept the post of <lb/>
nursery-governess in a family resident in the Isle <lb/>
of Wight; but, finding everything so entirely <lb/>
different from all she had been used to, she <reg orig="re-|turned">returned</reg> <lb/>
to Bristol for a short period, afterwards <lb/>
going to Odsey, near Royston, where she <reg orig="re-|mained">remained</reg> <lb/>
some time, and was very happy.</p>
<p>In 1829 Dr. Carpenter found it impossible to <lb/>
continue his school work; so the two eldest girls, <lb/>
having spent some months in Paris, returned to <lb/>
Bristol in time to open and continue the <reg orig="day-|school">day-school</reg> <lb/>
after the summer vacation.</p>
<p>In this, as in all else, Mary determined to do <lb/>
her best. It was necessary that certain sciences <lb/>
should be taught in the school; therefore she set <lb/>
herself to master these sciences, which included <lb/>
conchology and geology. Two years later she <lb/>
took over the management of the Sunday-school, <lb/>
and thus came into closer touch with the poor <lb/>
children, and learned the misery of their little <lb/>
lives.</p>
<p>Some slight idea of the horrors and privations <lb/>
under which they managed to exist, she had <lb/>
already; but now she realised to the full their <lb/>
dreadful lot, and determined, with God's help, <lb/>
to do all in her power to help them to <reg orig="some-|thing">something</reg> <lb/>
higher and happier.</p>
<p>The interest thus awakened never again <reg orig="slum-|bered">slumbered</reg>, <lb/>
and was considerably strengthened by the <lb/>
terrible sufferings of the poor during the bread <lb/>
riots in Bristol. With her, to determine was to <lb/>
do; and, though the opportunity was long in <lb/>
coming, she never once forsook her purpose.</p>

<pb n="57" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0070"/>
<head><hi rend="bold">CHAPTER II. <lb/>
Living in Earnest.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">A great</hi> deal of good work among the <lb/>
destitute poor had for some time been <lb/>
done by a body of Christian workers in <lb/>
Boston, U.S.A., and, in 1833, one of the chief <lb/>
of these, Dr. Joseph Tuckerman, visited England <lb/>
to recruit his health. He was well known to <lb/>
Dr. Carpenter by correspondence; so he was <lb/>
invited to Bristol, and soon became most helpful <lb/>
to Mary in her schemes for helping the poor. <lb/>
She took him round about the dirty narrow streets <lb/>
where these people dwelt, and one day a frightened, <lb/>
ragged little boy, darting from a narrow entry, <lb/>
ran quickly across the street before them. "That <lb/>
child," said Dr. Tuckerman, "should be followed <lb/>
to his home and seen after."</p>
<p>Though Miss Carpenter took no apparent notice <lb/>
of the remark, she never forgot it, and one of her <lb/>
earliest endeavours to reach the people was by <lb/>
following them to their wretched homes and <reg orig="speak-|ing">speaking</reg> <lb/>
words of comfort to them. In time a society <lb/>
for visiting and assisting the poor was formed, <lb/>
in connection with the meeting-house in Lewin's <lb/>
Mead, and Mary Carpenter was one of its most <lb/>
earnest workers. Finally she became its <reg orig="secre-|tary">secretary</reg>, <lb/>
and continued so for more than twenty years. <lb/>
This was the chance for which she had waited so <lb/>
long, and, now that it had come, it required all her <lb/>
strength of will and purpose to avail herself of it.</p>
<pb n="58" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0071"/>
<p>The sights and sounds she encountered in <lb/>
passing from house to house appalled her. Often <lb/>
and often she longed to turn back, to close eyes <lb/>
and ears to all around, and to escape to the pure <lb/>
atmosphere of her own home; but, as we have <lb/>
seen, to determine was to do; so, bravely <reg orig="smother-|ing">smothering</reg> <lb/>
her feelings, and controlling her repugnance, <lb/>
she persevered, taking a positive delight in forcing <lb/>
herself into visiting the worst houses of all, until, <lb/>
like Sister Dora, she walked alone through byways <lb/>
and alleys and courts where even the policemen <lb/>
were afraid to venture except in couples. Like <lb/>
Sister Dora, too, she won the regard of the very <lb/>
vilest by her utter unselfishness, devotion, and <lb/>
lack of any sign of loathing or fear.</p>
<p>Men and women lost to all sense of shame, <lb/>
quarrelling and fighting and blaspheming in the <lb/>
streets, slunk away abashed when she appeared; <lb/>
guilty lads hung their heads lest they should see <lb/>
the look of reproachful woe in her eyes. Mary <lb/>
Carpenter knew that God had opened up the way <lb/>
for her; so she resolved to show these people a <lb/>
higher way of life, and to rescue their young ones, <lb/>
if possible, from the squalor and degradation and <lb/>
vice in which they had been born.</p>
<p>Well would it have been had all the ladies who <lb/>
undertook to share in this work been gifted with <lb/>
the strength of mind Miss Carpenter so happily <lb/>
possessed: unfortunately they had not, and so <lb/>
they allowed themselves to be repelled by the <lb/>
fearful surroundings of the people whom they <lb/>
sought to benefit, and gave up in despair.</p>
<p>A domestic mission was then organised, on the <lb/>
<pb n="59" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0072"/>
same plan as that so successfully carried on by <lb/>
Dr. Tuckerman and his colleagues; but even <lb/>
this failed to reach the worst cases, and some <lb/>
time later Miss Carpenter thought out a surer <lb/>
way of remedying the evil. This was by getting <lb/>
hold of the children while still very young, and <lb/>
how she managed to do so we shall see in a <lb/>
further chapter.</p>
<p>Much good had, however, been already <reg orig="accom-|plished">accomplished</reg>, <lb/>
for when the subject of how to support <lb/>
the domestic mission was raised, one hundred <lb/>
poor families agreed to pay one penny each <lb/>
weekly towards it. This must have been <reg orig="gratify-|ing">gratifying</reg> <lb/>
to all; yet we find that Miss Carpenter was <lb/>
not satisfied with her efforts on behalf of others, <lb/>
or even with the management of her own thoughts <lb/>
and feelings. She was much given to <reg orig="self-|examination">self-examination</reg>, <lb/>
and when the results seemed to <lb/>
her not good, she became dreadfully cast down, <lb/>
and it was only due to her natural firmness of <lb/>
character that she was saved from absolute <lb/>
despair.</p>
<p>She had been suffering thus for some time, to <lb/>
the intense grief of those who loved her, when <lb/>
her mother was seized with a very serious illness; <lb/>
and Miss Carpenter, thoroughly roused from her <lb/>
despondent mood, devoted herself to nursing her <lb/>
mother and fulfilling her various duties to the <lb/>
best of her strength and ability. It was in times <lb/>
such as these that she most fully showed of what <lb/>
she was really capable, and the whole family <lb/>
learned the depth of her love and her power of <lb/>
self-sacrifice.</p>

Opening of the Ragged School.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">In</hi> the year 1839, Dr. Carpenter's health failed <lb/>
so alarmingly that it was thought well to send <lb/>
him abroad, where he might secure perfect <lb/>
rest and thorough change of air and scene. A <lb/>
medical friend offered to accompany him, and <lb/>
all went well until, in journeying from Leghorn <lb/>
to Marseilles, Dr. Carpenter was accidentally <lb/>
drowned.</p>
<p>The sorrowful news spread a great gloom over <lb/>
the whole family, and Miss Carpenter, whose <lb/>
reverence for her father was great, was utterly <lb/>
cast down by his death. Though she did <reg orig="every-|thing">everything</reg> <lb/>
in her power to lighten the blow to her <lb/>
mother, she never ceased to mourn, and <reg orig="through-|out">throughout</reg> <lb/>
the remainder of her own life she seemed to <lb/>
be in quiet communion with him who had been <lb/>
her great example of goodness, purity, and <lb/>
strength.</p>
<p>Shortly after this sad event, her dear friend <lb/>
and adviser, Dr. Tuckerman, passed away. From <lb/>
him she had learned how to put her longings <lb/>
into practical effect, and the various institutions <lb/>
she afterwards founded were the outcome of ideas <lb/>
suggested by him.</p>
<p>This second blow deepened the trouble of her <lb/>
father's loss, and she became so depressed that <lb/>
it was considered advisable to send her away <lb/>
for a complete change. She therefore visited <lb/>
<pb n="61" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0074"/>
the chief European towns, in company with <lb/>
some very dear friends, and returned to her <lb/>
home, if not quite restored to her usual <reg orig="bright-|ness">brightness</reg>, <lb/>
at least better able to fulfil her duties.</p>
<p>For some time she had been working at a <lb/>
small book of "Meditations": this she now <reg orig="com-|pleted">completed</reg> <lb/>
and published. It met with so much <lb/>
success that she was encouraged to further <lb/>
similar efforts at a later date.</p>
<p>The great struggle going on in America, for <lb/>
the freeing of slaves, had always interested the <lb/>
Carpenter family intensely, and each year they <lb/>
sent a goodly contribution towards raising funds <lb/>
for this object. An annual bazaar, known as <lb/>
the Abolition Fair, was held in Boston by the <lb/>
Christian workers there, and among the articles <lb/>
most readily sold were numerous beautiful pictures <lb/>
painted and given by Miss Carpenter.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, she was also doing much quiet <lb/>
work among the poor in and around Lewin's <lb/>
Mead, and she now determined to establish a <lb/>
school to enable her to get closer hold of the <lb/>
poor, ragged little mites she had so long yearned <lb/>
to rescue. Securing a room in the neighbourhood <lb/>
where the children lived, she selected a master, and <lb/>
opened the school one August Sunday in 1846.</p>
<p>Seven lads were invited, and they brought in <lb/>
twelve others, all very rowdy and ill-behaved. <lb/>
The numbers increased rapidly, but the general <lb/>
conduct was so bad that the help of the police <lb/>
was needed for some time. Lads and girls&mdash;or, <lb/>
indeed, young men and women, as many of <lb/>
them then were&mdash;flocked into the school, and <lb/>
<pb n="62" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0075"/>
the neighbours, though accustomed to all kinds <lb/>
of unseemly conduct, regarded them as a regular <lb/>
nuisance.</p>
<p>Miss Carpenter encouraged the master in every <lb/>
way she could, spending all her spare time in <lb/>
helping him. By degrees the unruly scholars <lb/>
yielded to the gentle yet firm treatment, until at <lb/>
last there was nothing for the policeman to do; <lb/>
so he just walked inside and helped to set copies <lb/>
for those whom he had previously terrorised into <lb/>
good behaviour.</p>
<p>In about six months there were two hundred <lb/>
scholars, well ordered, and mannerly beyond <lb/>
Miss Carpenter's brightest hopes. At the end <lb/>
of two years H.M. Inspector of Schools was <lb/>
able to report of the Ragged School in Lewin's <lb/>
Mead, that he "did not know of any other <lb/>
school of similar kind where so much good <lb/>
work was being done." The rough children <lb/>
were not only taught to read and write; they were <lb/>
encouraged to think for themselves, so that they <lb/>
might also become capable of acting for <reg orig="them-|selves">themselves</reg>, <lb/>
and thus able to resist the temptation to <lb/>
follow blindly in the footsteps of those among <lb/>
whom their lot unfortunately was cast.</p>
<p>They were taught that what they had hitherto <lb/>
regarded as the only manner of living, was <reg orig="alto-|gether">altogether</reg> <lb/>
wrong; they were shown the beauties of a <lb/>
higher life, and, after a time, some at least were <lb/>
filled with a desire to lift themselves above their <lb/>
deplorable surroundings.</p>
<p>Example is always better than precept, and Miss <lb/>
Carpenter realised this fully. She knew, too, that <lb/>
<pb n="63" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0076"/>
neither precept nor example is of any use to <lb/>
hungry children; so she provided hot soup for <lb/>
the poorest, and day after day attended to help <lb/>
in its distribution at noon. Clothing was given <lb/>
to those who had nothing but rags, and few even <lb/>
of them, to wear; cleanliness was encouraged; <lb/>
love for the truth&mdash;at all costs&mdash;was instilled into <lb/>
them; and, in time, Miss Carpenter was rewarded <lb/>
by the <hi rend="italic">love</hi> of these children, who had never <lb/>
before known its meaning.</p>
<p>She who had thought herself unlovable was <lb/>
taught her error by the children she had set <lb/>
herself to teach; and she also learned that her <lb/>
affection for them was not simply that of a good <lb/>
woman for the helpless and uncared-for, but was <lb/>
indeed the love of a <hi rend="italic">mother</hi> for her <hi rend="italic">children.</hi></p>
<p>As they grew old enough to leave the protection <lb/>
of the school life, she watched over them with <lb/>
unceasing care&mdash;writing to those at a distance; <lb/>
helping such as cared to try their fortunes in the <lb/>
colonies; guarding and seeking to hold, with <reg orig="un-|tiring">untiring</reg> <lb/>
effort, those who fell into bad hands and <lb/>
suffered the inevitable penalty.</p>

<head><hi rend="bold">CHAPTER IV. <lb/>
Reform&mdash;not Punishment&mdash;the Means of Rescue.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">One</hi> thing that struck Miss Carpenter very <lb/>
forcibly was the fact that young people, on <lb/>
being released from prison, rarely, if ever, <lb/>
seemed the better for the punishment. She <lb/>
<pb n="64" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0077"/>
noticed rather that they soon sinned again, and <lb/>
yet again, until they became quite hardened in <lb/>
their wicked ways. This caused her much <lb/>
anxious thought, and at last she wrote to several <lb/>
prison chaplains who were deeply interested in <lb/>
the same subject.</p>
<p>It seemed to her that this sending of young <lb/>
people to jail, where they were brought into <lb/>
contact with men and women old in sin and <lb/>
wickedness, was not the way to improve them, <lb/>
but rather to corrupt what was good in them. <lb/>
It seemed to her, too, that they were punished <lb/>
not so much with a view to their own reform, as <lb/>
to rid society of them; not so much to teach <lb/>
them the error of their ways, as to be revenged <lb/>
upon them for the evil they had brought upon <lb/>
others.</p>
<p>Now, in Miss Carpenter's opinion, this was not <lb/>
the way to abolish crime, but to multiply criminals; <lb/>
so she resolved to seek some better way out of <lb/>
the difficulty. Her first idea&mdash;to get at the root of <lb/>
the matter by rescuing the young children and <lb/>
training them aright&mdash;was good, but it would <lb/>
avail nothing if they were to be allowed to herd <lb/>
with criminals just when they most needed <lb/>
strengthening.</p>
<p>Every one, however, could not agree with her <lb/>
views: while she said these children were not <lb/>
sinners from choice, but because they were born <lb/>
into a sinful atmosphere, others argued that as <lb/>
soon as they were old enough they ought to <lb/>
know right from wrong, and, if they failed to <lb/>
do so, they must be <hi rend="italic">punished</hi>.</p>
<pb n="65" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0078"/>
<p>So she had a long and uphill battle to fight, <lb/>
but she was just the woman for the conflict. <lb/>
Nothing daunted her; specious arguments failed <lb/>
to convince her; even the continued backslidings <lb/>
of those for whom she so bravely toiled were <reg orig="power-|less">powerless</reg> <lb/>
to turn her from what she considered right. <lb/>
Of the parents of her scholars, the vilest even of <lb/>
whom she boldly visited in their own foul homes, <lb/>
she had little hope, though she continued to do <lb/>
her best for them; but she was determined that, <lb/>
with God's help, the children should have a <lb/>
better chance.</p>
<p>The schoolroom in Lewin's Mead had become <lb/>
too small to accommodate the numbers that <lb/>
sought admission; so larger premises were <lb/>
acquired, together with the whole of the court <lb/>
in which they stood. This was a great joy to <lb/>
her; for she at once took steps to remove all the <lb/>
dirty old dwellings, and to put up in their stead <lb/>
nice little homes with baths, and wash-houses, <lb/>
and water-supply.</p>
<p>These were let to respectable working people, <lb/>
who, by her efforts, had been reclaimed, and some <lb/>
of the homeless boys in the school were lodged <lb/>
with them. This was in the year 1850; many <lb/>
years later she was in a position to provide a <lb/>
properly organised home for those of her scholars <lb/>
who needed it.</p>
<p>The children were taught not only to respect <lb/>
themselves, but to care for others; and when they <lb/>
heard of the slavery in which so many of their <lb/>
fellow-creatures in America were held, they did <lb/>
all in their power to help to free them. Scarcely <lb/>
<pb n="66" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0079"/>
a child, in that school of poor children, failed to <lb/>
give some simple article of his or her own making <lb/>
to be sent in Miss Carpenter's annual box to the <lb/>
Christmas Abolition Fair.</p>
<p>They were taught, too, to love and care for all <lb/>
that made for the beauty of their surroundings; <lb/>
and, to further this teaching somewhat, Miss <lb/>
Carpenter set creeping plants close to the walls, <lb/>
and the scholars reared them with tender care. <lb/>
The work done was thoroughly good, but it was <lb/>
limited to the <hi rend="italic">school</hi> life of each child.</p>
<p>As we have seen, the friend of the children <lb/>
was working her hardest to remedy this; and <lb/>
when she had gathered sufficient evidence, she <lb/>
placed it before the Government, and asked for <lb/>
aid to carry out her scheme for the <hi rend="italic">reform</hi> of those <lb/>
who would inevitably fall into sin on leaving the <lb/>
Ragged Schools.</p>
<p>She suggested good free schools for those who <lb/>
wished to attend; day industrial schools which <lb/>
certain children should be <hi rend="italic">compelled</hi> to attend, <lb/>
and where they should be fed; and reformatory <lb/>
schools to which all children convicted of crime <lb/>
should be sent for a fixed time, and fed, clothed, <lb/>
and taught some means of earning an honest <lb/>
livelihood.</p>
<p>Of course this meant a great deal of expense, <lb/>
which Miss Carpenter proposed to meet by <reg orig="com-|pelling">compelling</reg> <lb/>
the parents of such children to help in <lb/>
supporting them, or, if they had no parents, to <lb/>
obtain assistance from the authorities of the parish <lb/>
to which they belonged; the remainder was to <lb/>
be met by aid from Government.</p>
<pb n="67" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0080"/>
<p>There was much to be said against removing <lb/>
a child to such a school against his own wish or <lb/>
the wish of his parents, and it was necessary to <lb/>
obtain the power to do this.</p>
<p>Arrangements were therefore made for a <reg orig="con-|ference">conference</reg> <lb/>
of Christian workers, who had given the <lb/>
subject their most serious consideration. Miss <lb/>
Carpenter attended the conference, but gathered <lb/>
from the remarks made that her own views were <lb/>
not exactly expressed by the speakers. This <lb/>
impression grew as she gave the matter more <lb/>
thought, and at last it seemed to her that if the <lb/>
suggestions of the conference were given effect <lb/>
to by Parliament, they would lead, not to the <lb/>
establishment of <hi rend="italic">schools of reform</hi>, but to that of <lb/>
more <hi rend="italic">prisons</hi>.</p>
<p>To prevent what in her opinion would be a <lb/>
serious mistake, she laboured hard to establish <lb/>
a private reformatory school managed on her <lb/>
own principle. It was a tremendous undertaking, <lb/>
and taxed even Miss Carpenter's powers of <lb/>
endurance sorely, but it was at length successfully <lb/>
accomplished.</p>
<p>A Mr. Russell Scott, who had long taken a <lb/>
deep interest in the question of child crime, and <lb/>
had, too, a strong desire to do something toward <lb/>
preventing it, wrote to Miss Carpenter, offering <lb/>
not only to buy suitable premises, but also <lb/>
to help in the management. These premises <lb/>
were situated at Kingswood, not far from Bristol, <lb/>
and had been formerly used as a Wesleyan school, <lb/>
the celebrated founder of this sect having lived <lb/>
in the house near by.</p>
<pb n="68" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0081"/>
<p>Miss Carpenter hailed the proposal with delight, <lb/>
but the question arose as to how the reformatory <lb/>
was to be furnished with even the barest <reg orig="neces-|sities">necessities</reg>. <lb/>
This difficulty soon disappeared, however; <lb/>
for Lady Byron, who was a keen supporter of <lb/>
Miss Carpenter's efforts, kindly volunteered to <lb/>
give the whole of the furniture, in addition to <lb/>
a substantial sum of money, and this, with other <lb/>
contributions, enabled Miss Carpenter to open <lb/>
her long-desired Reformatory school at <reg orig="Kings-|wood">Kingswood</reg>, <lb/>
on 11th September 1852, just about six <lb/>
years after she had established her Ragged <lb/>
School in Lewin's Mead.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">As</hi> in the ragged-school, so here; the children's <lb/>
friend soon gained their love. Shortly after <lb/>
the opening of the reformatory one of the <lb/>
boys behaved so badly that it was found necessary <lb/>
to lock him up. He was brought before Miss <lb/>
Carpenter on her next visit, and this is what <lb/>
she says about it; "A poor little sinner who <lb/>
had been obliged to be locked up&mdash;a most dreadful <lb/>
punishment to these wild creatures&mdash;when brought <lb/>
to me, put his little hand on my shoulder, and <lb/>
sobbed out his grievances. The balm of a few <lb/>
kisses quite restored him to a sane state; I knew <lb/>
that the poor little fellow felt that I loved him, <lb/>
and I was thankful for his love."</p>
<p>One cannot wonder, if that was the way she <lb/>

dealt with the forlorn little waifs, that her efforts <lb/>
were so very successful. It was her <hi rend="italic">motherliness</hi> <lb/>
that won them, her gentle care that kept them, <lb/>
and her noble example of righteous living that <lb/>
stimulated them to be good themselves.</p>
<p>Miss Carpenter was, indeed, a busy woman at this <lb/>
period. In addition to her home duties, she spent <lb/>
a great deal of time at the Ragged School; she was <lb/>
engaged in writing another book; and now there <lb/>
was this new work. She was never a rich woman, <lb/>
and all that she gave away was saved by personal <lb/>
sacrifice. Thus we find that on the coldest winter <lb/>
days, no matter what the state of the weather, <lb/>
she trudged cheerfully the whole four miles to <lb/>
Kingswood and back again to save the expense <lb/>
of a cab.</p>
<p>One day, as she and two lady friends were on <lb/>
their way there, Miss Carpenter entered a <reg orig="police-|station">police-station</reg> <lb/>
and brought out with her a poor, <reg orig="forlorn-|looking">forlorn-looking</reg> <lb/>
small boy. Snow was falling and the <lb/>
ground was covered with it; therefore, as much <lb/>
for the child's sake as anything, it was decided <lb/>
to take a cab. Unfortunately, however, they were <lb/>
not able to get one, and so the whole distance <lb/>
had to be done on foot.</p>
<p>Miss Carpenter and one lady led the way, while <lb/>
the other followed with the child. They had not <lb/>
gone far before several street-urchins began <reg orig="merci-|lessly">mercilessly</reg> <lb/>
pelting the poor boy with snowballs, much <lb/>
to the discomfort of the lady. Miss Carpenter at <lb/>
last discovered what was going on, and advised <lb/>
the child to take no notice of his tormentors. The <lb/>
plucky boy did as he was bidden, and the children, <lb/>
<pb n="70" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0085"/>
finding little fun in so one-sided an arrangement, <lb/>
soon ceased their teasing.</p>
<p>The reformatory was at length reached, and, <lb/>
of the whole party, none perhaps was so glad <lb/>
as the half-starved, shivering waif. To him it <lb/>
meant food, and warmth, and <hi rend="italic">kindness</hi>, and if at <lb/>
times the restraint necessary to the good order of <lb/>
the place proved trying to him, there is no doubt <lb/>
that he was heartily glad that Mary Carpenter <lb/>
had taken him under her sheltering wing.</p>
<p>Since the founding of her ragged-school she <lb/>
had organised a yearly gathering, or re-union, of <lb/>
all her old scholars, at the time of "Peace on <lb/>
earth, goodwill towards men," and this year the <lb/>
numbers were increased by those from the home at <lb/>
Kingswood. Many travelled long distances to be <lb/>
present, but those who were too far off to come were <lb/>
always remembered; numerous lifelong friendships <lb/>
and helpful ties were formed, and, as Miss Carpenter <lb/>
moved about among her young friends, she was <lb/>
regarded by all with looks of love and devotion.</p>
<p>To make them good men and women had been <lb/>
her aim&mdash;not by force, but example; not from fear <lb/>
of punishment, but because they were convinced <lb/>
of the evil of the ways of those around them. <lb/>
Some there were who took many backward steps, <lb/>
but the watchful eyes and ready hands of their <lb/>
friend and her willing helpers were ever ready <lb/>
to guide them back into the right path; and if, <lb/>
as sometimes happened, some slipped wholly out <lb/>
of their grasp, many earnest petitions were made <lb/>
on their behalf to the All-Father, who sees even <lb/>
the sparrow's fall.</p>

<div2 type="chapter" n="VI" id="d30">
<pb n="71" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0086"/>
<head><hi rend="bold">CHAPTER VI. <lb/>
The Trials of Kingswood</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Two</hi> books written by Miss Carpenter, on the <lb/>
subject of Reformatory Schools, made known <lb/>
to numbers of thinking people stories and <lb/>
scenes in child-life that they would never have <lb/>
thought possible. That a great deal of <reg orig="wicked-|ness">wickedness</reg> <lb/>
and misery did exist, they knew well; also <lb/>
that children were born and reared in blackest <lb/>
infamy; but, as they were never brought into <lb/>
contact with them, they failed to realise the pathos <lb/>
of the fact. That it was their bounden duty to <lb/>
do something toward rescuing such, had never for <lb/>
a moment occurred to them.</p>
<p>When, therefore, a second conference of Christian <lb/>
workers, to discuss the question of child crime and <lb/>
its prevention by means of reformatory schools, <lb/>
was held at Birmingham, in 1853, it was attended <lb/>
by far larger numbers than the first had been, <lb/>
and Miss Carpenter, accordingly, hoped for better <lb/>
results.</p>
<p>The Rev. T. Carter, who had sent some very <lb/>
bad cases to the Kingswood Reformatory, returned <lb/>
with Miss Carpenter to Bristol, and, on visiting that <lb/>
institution, the latter says: "He hardly knew how <lb/>
to believe that the children with fine open <reg orig="coun-|tenances">countenances</reg> <lb/>
and affectionate hearts, who so warmly <lb/>
greeted him, were the depraved and hardened <lb/>
little wretches whom he had sent there."</p>
<p>It must not, however, be supposed that the <lb/>
<pb n="72" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0087"/>
school was carried on without many weary <lb/>
struggles. The good master and mistress had <lb/>
their patience and loving forbearance tried to the <lb/>
utmost. The spirit of rebellion against control <lb/>
in any shape or form had to be overcome before <lb/>
anything else could be attempted.</p>
<p>No idea of the difficulties encountered can be <lb/>
conceived unless it is distinctly remembered that <lb/>
these children had never, in the course of their <lb/>
lives, submitted to anything but physical force <lb/>
and bodily fear. The principle of loving but firm <lb/>
government was altogether new to them, and it <lb/>
was long before they understood it.</p>
<p>Many and many a time it seemed almost <reg orig="im-|possible">impossible</reg> <lb/>
to continue the effort; but when those <lb/>
in charge of the school were on the verge of <lb/>
despair, when some unusually flagrant act of <lb/>
insubordination tempted them to give up once <lb/>
and for all, Miss Carpenter stepped in and <lb/>
smoothed the rough places. Yet even she was <lb/>
obliged to write, after one of these occasions, "As <lb/>
for me, it is a blessing that I have an inexhaustible <lb/>
share of faith, hope, and love, otherwise I should <lb/>
not be able to bear up; but I study every failure <lb/>
to learn how to succeed better, and quite see the <lb/>
way opening to a better order of things."</p>
<p>But the more trouble and anxiety the children <lb/>
caused her, the more she grew to love them, and <lb/>
the more determined she was to conquer by God's <lb/>
help; and at last, she was able to trust the boys <lb/>
to go on messages into Bristol. Girls, well known <lb/>
to have been young thieves, were sent into the <lb/>
village of Kingswood to make purchases with <lb/>
<pb n="73" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0088"/>
money, and not one abused the trust placed in <lb/>
her.</p>
<p>The journeys to and fro now became very <lb/>
tiring to Miss Carpenter; so a room was furnished <lb/>
for her use in the old Wesley House, and here <lb/>
she passed many anxious days and nights, much <lb/>
comforted by the words the good John Wesley <lb/>
had written on the window-pane, "God is here!" <lb/>
Much as she would have liked to live entirely <lb/>
at Kingswood, Miss Carpenter was unable to <lb/>
do so, as she felt that her chief duty was to <lb/>
care for and comfort her mother, who was now <lb/>
an old lady. It was a great relief, therefore, to <lb/>
feel that the school was now in good working <lb/>
order, and that the children were keenly alive to <lb/>
the fact that everything was being done solely <lb/>
for their benefit.</p>
<p>The time came, however, when it was thought <lb/>
advisable to keep the Kingswood Reformatory <lb/>
entirely for the reception of boys, who, strange <lb/>
as it may seem to us, were much more easily <lb/>
reformed than girls; so Miss Carpenter purchased <lb/>
an old Elizabethan house, known as the Red <lb/>
Lodge, situated in Park Row, Bristol, with money <lb/>
generously given for the object by her ardent <lb/>
supporter, Lady Byron.</p>
<p>Meantime, the suggestions of the two Conferences <lb/>
had at last received the recognition of Parliament, <lb/>
and a law was passed giving sanction to the <lb/>
establishment of reformatory schools by private <lb/>
persons, provided they met with the approval of <lb/>
the Home Secretary. This was a great step <lb/>
gained; for really Miss Carpenter had had no <lb/>
<pb n="74" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0089"/>
authority, save that of the parents, for keeping <lb/>
children under restraint in her school at <reg orig="Kings-|wood">Kingswood</reg>, <lb/>
and owing to this fact much trouble had <lb/>
arisen. It was therefore with a feeling of intense <lb/>
relief that she opened the reformatory school for girls <lb/>
only, in the Red Lodge, on 10th October 1854.</p>
<p>A kindly, energetic matron was appointed, and <lb/>
on the first day one poor girl was admitted, while <lb/>
at the end of a month, when the place was <lb/>
inspected by the Government Inspector of Prisons, <lb/>
there were but seven girls in residence. Shortly <lb/>
afterwards, however, the girls still at Kingswood <lb/>
were sent in to the Red Lodge, and this institution, <lb/>
from the first, remained under the sole direction <lb/>
of Miss Carpenter. She still was most attentive <lb/>
to her Sunday and ragged schools, and never <lb/>
relaxed her interest in the reformatory at <reg orig="Kings-|wood">Kingswood</reg>; <lb/>
but, after its establishment, she found her <lb/>
greatest comfort in the work at the Red Lodge.</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="VII" id="d31">
<head><hi rend="bold">CHAPTER VII. <lb/>
Miss Carpenter's New Home.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Christmas</hi> again drew near, and the pleasant <lb/>
annual gathering was looked forward to <lb/>
with great delight, for this year there would <lb/>
be still more to enjoy the happy time. But, alas! <lb/>
she who had always been the centre of affection <lb/>
on these joyous occasions, was now lying upon <lb/>
a bed of suffering.</p>
<p>For more than three months it was uncertain <lb/>
<pb n="75" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0090"/>
whether Miss Carpenter would recover, and of <lb/>
all the loving messages of sympathy, and kind <lb/>
inquiries as to her condition, none were so <lb/>
welcome to the invalid as those of her dear <lb/>
children. So much did they love her that they <lb/>
were positively afraid to do anything wrong <lb/>
during her illness lest she should hear of it, and <lb/>
so be made worse.</p>
<p>The Red Lodge was ably managed during Miss <lb/>
Carpenter's illness by her sister Anna, of whom <lb/>
mention has already been made; and, in May, <lb/>
Miss Carpenter was strong enough to visit it <lb/>
for a short time, though months passed before <lb/>
she was able to resume her labours of love.</p>
<p>But now the friend of the children found it <lb/>
necessary to give up her superintendence of the <lb/>
Sunday afternoon school, as, the morning and <lb/>
evening being taken up by the Ragged School, <lb/>
no time was left for the Sunday lesson at the Red <lb/>
Lodge. Under her influence the poor girls who <lb/>
had been admitted to the Red Lodge were slowly <lb/>
but surely improving.</p>
<p>So freely did she spend herself and her means <lb/>
for them, that one girl said to her, "There isn't <lb/>
anything you would not do for us if you could!" <lb/>
while a ragged urchin once told a clergyman that <lb/>
"Miss Carpenter gave away all her money for <lb/>
the naughty boys, and only kept enough to make <lb/>
herself clean and decent!"</p>
<p>She never stood aloof from the poor girls, but, <lb/>
as she had begun so many years before, she <lb/>
continued&mdash;the <hi rend="italic">mother</hi> of all who came under <lb/>
her influence. No face, however debased by <lb/>
<pb n="76" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0091"/>
passion and vice, was too repulsive for her to <lb/>
kiss; no child, however sullen and unruly, was <lb/>
to naughty for her loving forgiveness.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">home</hi> feeling was cultivated by the giving <lb/>
of small presents on birthdays and festive <lb/>
occasions, and the children loved to make little <lb/>
gifts in return. Visitors to the school were very <lb/>
pleasantly impressed by the ease of manner <lb/>
common to the children; there was no sign of <lb/>
fear or restraint: they were just like a family of <lb/>
well-trained, polite children, ready to reply to <lb/>
questions, but never presuming.</p>
<p>The death of her beloved mother, in the <lb/>
summer of 1856, was a blow to Miss Carpenter <lb/>
from which she never really recovered. Although <lb/>
her brothers and sisters did all they could to <lb/>
cheer her, they could not lift the could which <lb/>
seemed to have settled on her, and it was clear <lb/>
that her life depended on a complete change of <lb/>
surroundings. The room she occupied in the <lb/>
home of her sister Anna reminded her far too <lb/>
strongly of her mother, and at length Lady <lb/>
Byron, having bought a house quite close to <lb/>
the Red Lodge, offered it to Miss Carpenter as <lb/>
a home.</p>
<p>This benevolent lady had already added <lb/>
largely to the Red Lodge property, and the <lb/>
last bequest brought to Miss Carpenter just the <lb/>
change she so needed. Here she was able to <lb/>
sit at her windows and watch her children at <lb/>
play; and here, after a time, she regained some <lb/>
of her old vigour of body and mind. Her pen <lb/>
was soon busy with her favourite subject&mdash;that <lb/>
<pb n="77" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0092"/>
of Reformatories; and in November she gained a <lb/>
prize for an essay on their management. This <lb/>
prize-money was spent on her beloved work, and <lb/>
it is pleasing to know that, through her valuable <lb/>
writings, much lasting good was done for the cause <lb/>
she had so much at heart.</p>
<p>The gift of this small cottage also enabled Miss <lb/>
Carpenter to keep some of the older girls and train <lb/>
them for domestic service. They were allowed a <lb/>
certain amount of freedom&mdash;being occasionally left <lb/>
entirely in charge of the house, and made to <reg orig="under-|stand">understand</reg> <lb/>
that perfect trust was reposed in them&mdash;and <lb/>
the experiment proved most successful.</p>
<p>At the close of the year 1857, she was able <lb/>
to write to Lady Byron that the Kingswood <lb/>
Reformatory, now under the management of <lb/>
a committee, was in a very satisfactory and <lb/>
progressive state; and that at Christmas she <lb/>
hoped to provide a good dinner for two hundred <lb/>
poor children at the Ragged School, as well as <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">home</hi> treats, with Christmas and birthday presents, <lb/>
to the young people at Kingswood and the Red <lb/>
Lodge.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Miss carpenter's</hi> untiring efforts to <lb/>
obtain Government aid for ragged-schools <lb/>
were at last successful, and it is only right <lb/>
to say that these same efforts were the means <lb/>
<pb n="78" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0093"/>
of furthering the education of the children of <lb/>
the working-classes all over the country. Two <lb/>
industrial schools were established in London, <lb/>
but much had yet to be done before such <lb/>
institutions became general.</p>
<p>Miss Carpenter spared no personal labour in <lb/>
bringing home to the Government the great need <lb/>
for these schools, which, she said, should be for <lb/>
that class of children who would not attend the <lb/>
ragged-schools, and who, allowed to grow up <lb/>
in ignorance and vice, were qualifying to fill the <lb/>
prisons at no very distant date. She contended <lb/>
that it was cheaper to feed and educate children <lb/>
than to maintain criminals, and that, if these <lb/>
children could not be rescued with their will, then <lb/>
they must be rescued against it.</p>
<p>Quite near to the Red Lodge were some <reg orig="build-|ings">buildings</reg> <lb/>
which seemed to Miss Carpenter just suitable <lb/>
for such a school, and a Mr.Frederick Chapple, <lb/>
of Liverpool, very generously purchased and <lb/>
presented them to her. Other good friends <lb/>
kindly furnished them, and, in April 1859, the <lb/>
Park Row Certified Industrial School, for boys, <lb/>
was opened. Money, of course, was needed to <lb/>
carry on the work, and this Miss Carpenter <lb/>
managed, by strenuous personal effort, to obtain.</p>
<p>It had been her custom, for many years, to <lb/>
assist in the emigration of the lads leaving the <lb/>
Kingswood Reformatory; but now it occurred to <lb/>
her that if some means of retaining a hold over <lb/>
them could be devised, there was no reason why, <lb/>
if they wished, they should not remain in their <lb/>
own country.</p>
<pb n="79" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0094"/>
<p>Her next step, therefore, was to found a <lb/>
Workmen's Hall, in which the young men <lb/>
could gather for recreation and pleasant <reg orig="com-|panionship">companionship</reg>, <lb/>
and where they could also improve <lb/>
their minds. This, she thought, would keep <lb/>
them out of the public-houses and from bad <lb/>
company; but, unfortunately, she was not able <lb/>
at once to carry the project through, owing to <lb/>
a somewhat severe illness.</p>
<p>In the following December, however, a temporary <lb/>
Workmen's Hall was opened, and here the youths <lb/>
who had been trained under her care, or in one <lb/>
of the institutions founded by her, as well as all <lb/>
and sundry who wished to avail themselves of its <lb/>
advantages, met night after night in rational <reg orig="en-|joyment">enjoyment</reg>; <lb/>
and here Miss Carpenter had the <reg orig="satis-|faction">satisfaction</reg> <lb/>
of seeing respectable, well-living young <lb/>
men helping to hold in bonds of good-fellowship <lb/>
and brotherhood the weaker ones, who, but for <lb/>
this latest of her good works, would have drifted <lb/>
away to the degradation and infamy from which <lb/>
they had been rescued.</p>
<p>And all this time her busy brain was at work <lb/>
on plans for the bettering of the condition under <lb/>
which our convicts lived during their terms of <lb/>
imprisonment, with the result that a very able <lb/>
book on the subject was ready for publication in <lb/>
the year 1864.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the time had now come when <lb/>
the effect of all this work was making itself felt, <lb/>
but, with her usual resolution, she continued her <lb/>
labours in spite of warning. The new <reg orig="Work-|men's">Workmen's</reg> <lb/>
Hall, in St. Jame's Back, was opened in <lb/>
<pb n="80" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0095"/>
March 1865, and the chief work fell upon her. <lb/>
She was still taking a very active share in the <lb/>
Abolition Movement in the United States; and <lb/>
also now had it in mind to satisfy the craving <lb/>
she had long felt, to be of use in the Christian <lb/>
work then being carried on in India.</p>
<p>Nothing her friends could say would dissuade <lb/>
her from this new undertaking; but, before setting <lb/>
out upon her journey, she called together some of <lb/>
her fellow-workers and other ladies, and pointed <lb/>
out to them the necessity for establishing an <lb/>
industrial school for girls. "This must be done, <lb/>
and you are to do it," she said to them; and <lb/>
they did it. Some buildings were secured in the <lb/>
Royal Fort, St. Michael's Hill, Bristol, and, on <lb/>
being furnished, were opened for the reception of <lb/>
girls, on the same principle as that at Park Row, <lb/>
for boys, and proved a complete success.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Between</hi> the years 1866 and 1875 Miss <lb/>
Carpenter visited India four times. For <lb/>
many years she had hoped to be able to <lb/>
do something toward broadening and brightening <lb/>
the lives of Hindu women and girls, and the first <lb/>
step to this end, she felt sure, was education.</p>
<p>Many difficulties had to be overcome, but she <lb/>
was used to difficulties. So, by dint of ceaseless <lb/>
effort, she established Female Normal Schools in <lb/>
<pb n="81" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0096"/>
Ahmedabad and Bombay, and obtained <reg orig="Govern-|ment">Government</reg> <lb/>
aid towards their maintenance; she founded <lb/>
a Model High School for Hindu girls, the cost <lb/>
of which she herself bore for the first year; and <lb/>
also did much in improving the management of <lb/>
jails and prisons throughout that vast empire.</p>
<p>Although now well advanced in years, this <lb/>
wonderful woman, having set her home work in <lb/>
order, actually visited many towns on the <reg orig="Con-|tinent">Continent</reg>, <lb/>
and also in the United States and Canada, <lb/>
where she did much to better the conditions under <lb/>
which the prisoners lived. Her pen, too, was <lb/>
never idle. To achieve her end, this noble woman <lb/>
spent time, money, and the strength of a by no <lb/>
means robust constitution, counting herself happy <lb/>
in that, by God's help, she had not lived in vain.</p>
<p>During all these years her work in Bristol was <lb/>
progressing most favourably, and, her travels <lb/>
once over, she devoted herself to converting her <lb/>
Ragged School in St. James's Back into a Feeding <lb/>
Day Industrial School. This was accomplished <lb/>
on New-year's Day, 1872, and, shortly after, a <lb/>
Boy's Home was opened close by.</p>
<p>For her life of unceasing effort on behalf of <lb/>
others she received the personal thanks of the late <lb/>
Queen; and, during her continental tour, she was <lb/>
presented with a bracelet by the late Princess <lb/>
Louis of Hesse Darmstadt &lpar;our Princess Alice&rpar;, <lb/>
who had received it as a gift from her mother, <lb/>
Queen Victoria.</p>
<p>Miss Carpenter was now seventy years of age, <lb/>
but her power of mind was still as great as ever, <lb/>
for, in May of the year 1877, we find that she <lb/>
<pb n="82" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0097"/>
delivered a most telling lecture on her favourite <lb/>
subject, India, at the Philosophical Institution, <lb/>
established by her father fifty years before.</p>
<p>Her interest in the school at Kingswood had <lb/>
never flagged. On 6th June she spoke to a <lb/>
crowded meeting in the little chapel there for <lb/>
more than an hour, and even promised to go <lb/>
again. Truly, it may be said she died in <lb/>
harness, for the very last night of her life was <lb/>
spent in writing quietly in her study.</p>
<p>Before the next day had dawned her earthly <lb/>
labours were over for ever; she had received <lb/>
that call from above which all the Master's good <lb/>
servants await with joy; she had fought a good <lb/>
fight, she had run a good race.</p>
<p>She was laid to rest in Arno Vale Cemetery, <lb/>
just outside Bristol, beside the mother and sister <lb/>
she had loved so well. A long procession of <lb/>
mourners followed her to the grave: girls and <lb/>
boys from the schools in Park Row; sturdy youths <lb/>
from the reformatory at Kingswood; tattered waifs <lb/>
from the Day Industrial School; dark-skinned lads <lb/>
from Hindustan; men and women, respected and <lb/>
respectful, whom she had saved from worse than <lb/>
living death&mdash;all were there to mourn the woman <lb/>
who had spent her life in their service.</p>
<p>They formed a living monument to the memory <lb/>
of the noble dead, but the people of Bristol <reg orig="deter-|mined">determined</reg> <lb/>
it should not be the only one. A meeting <lb/>
was called at which the Mayor presided, and it was <lb/>
resolved to found a home for working boys, similar <lb/>
to the one she had established at St. Jame's Back, <lb/>
and one for working women and girls, as being the <lb/>
<pb n="83" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0098"/>
most fitting memorial of one to whom the welfare <lb/>
of these had been as the breath of life.</p>
<p>A mural tablet, surmounted by a medallion <lb/>
profile of Miss Carpenter, was placed in Bristol <lb/>
Cathedral, and on it was written the following:- <lb/>
<q>Sacred to the memory of <lb/>
<hi rend="bold">MARY CARPENTER,</hi></q>
<q>Foremost amongst the Founders <lb/>
of Reformatory and Industrial Schools <lb/>
in this City and Realm.</q>
<q>Neither the claims of private duty <lb/>
nor the tastes of a cultured mind <lb/>
could withdraw her compassionate eye <lb/>
from the uncared-for children of the streets.</q>
<q>Loving them while yet unlovely, <lb/>
she so formed them to the fair and good <lb/>
as to inspire others with her faith and hope, <lb/>
and thus led the way to a national system <lb/>
of moral rescue and preventive discipline.</q>
<q>Taking also to heart the grievous lot <lb/>
of Oriental women, <lb/>
in the last decade of her life <lb/>
she four times went to India, <lb/>
and awakened and active interest <lb/>
in their education and training for serious duties.</q>
<q>No human ill escaped her pity, or cast down her trust: <lb/>
with true self-sacrifice she followed in the train of Christ, <lb/>
to seek and to save that which was lost, <lb/>
and bring it home to the Father in Heaven.</q>
<q>Desiring to extend her work of piety and love, <lb/>
many who honoured her have instituted in her name <lb/>
some homes for the houseless young, <lb/>
and now complete their tribute of affection <lb/>
by erecting this memorial.</q></p>

<p>The late South African War has again opened <lb/>
the eyes of the British nation to the value of her <lb/>
warrior sons; but, as time passes, so will this <reg orig="feel-|ing">feeling</reg>, <lb/>
though never again will the British soldier be <lb/>
neglected and scorned as he was but half a century <lb/>
ago, by the very people he had given his all to <lb/>
benefit.</p>
<pb n="85" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0100"/>
<p>He was badly paid, ill fed, and poorly housed; <lb/>
looked upon as a machine by those in authority <lb/>
over him, and shunned by all but the lowest, <lb/>
who only favoured him, the more easily to fleece <lb/>
him of his hardly-earned and scanty pay. He <lb/>
could obtain neither refreshment nor lodging in any <lb/>
decent house, yet he was blamed because of the <lb/>
company he was forced to seek. Some may think <lb/>
this an exaggerated version of affairs: but there <lb/>
are those still living who know it to be less, rather <lb/>
than beyond the truth.</p>
<p>How, then, has the present position of the soldier <lb/>
been brought about? How is it that, in so brief <lb/>
a space, he has become respected by the highest <lb/>
and revered by all? Brave he always was, but <lb/>
to-day he is an intelligent, thoughtful, educated <lb/>
man, far superior in many respects to civilians in <lb/>
his own rank of life. In the old days he was a <lb/>
swearing, drinking, blasphemous fellow; to-day <lb/>
it is not at all rare to find the soldier a <reg orig="God-|fearing">God-fearing</reg> <lb/>
man, pledged against intoxicants, and <lb/>
from whose lips no foul words issue. And it is <lb/>
not too much to say that this change in the great <lb/>
mass of British soldiers is largely due to the <lb/>
work of one good woman.</p>
<p>While there have been, and still are, numbers <lb/>
of people who have grudged neither money nor <lb/>
effort for the welfare of the soldier's soul, Miss <lb/>
Sarah Robinson was, perhaps, the first to <reg orig="en-|deavour">endeavour</reg> <lb/>
to improve his bodily comfort. While <lb/>
fully realising the need of the <hi rend="italic">preacher</hi>, she felt <lb/>
keenly that, without the practical helper, the seed <lb/>
must fall on barren ground; this place, therefore, <lb/>
<pb n="86" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0101"/>
she resolved, with all the firmness of her strong <lb/>
will, to fill to the very best of her ability.</p>
<p>How this resolve was carried out, and the <lb/>
lasting effects it produced, will be seen from the <lb/>
following short sketch of her life.</p>
<p>The greater portion of her childhood was spent <lb/>
at Heasmond, in Sussex, where her father, John <lb/>
James Robinson, a man of some standing and <lb/>
affluence, owned an estate. She was one of six <lb/>
children, and was delicate, sensitive, and averse to <lb/>
notice by strangers. She was exceedingly <reg orig="inquisi-|tive">inquisitive</reg> <lb/>
too, and asked so many questions that her <lb/>
brothers and sister threatened to call her "Little <lb/>
Miss Why-Why." She was also very credulous, <lb/>
and it was most difficult to shake her belief in <lb/>
what she was told. As a small child she was fond <lb/>
of cats, and her greatest pet in later life was one <lb/>
named <hi rend="italic">Sandy;</hi> so she was constant in her affections <lb/>
even to the domestic pussy.</p>
<p>Being some years younger than her sister, she <lb/>
became the playfellow chiefly of her brothers and <lb/>
their friends, and was no whit behind them in <lb/>
games or mischief. Though to all appearance a <lb/>
happy little girl, she was in real need of some <lb/>
sympathetic ear into which she might pour her <lb/>
tale of longings, and yearnings, and strivings for <lb/>
something beyond the daily round of life.</p>
<p>Naturally self-contained and self-reliant, she thus <lb/>
lived a separate life, as it were, in the midst of her <lb/>
family. Her parents, though thoroughly godly, <lb/>
estimable people, made no show of their affection <lb/>
to their children&mdash;not allowing them to keep their <lb/>
pets long, lest they should become too fond of <lb/>
<pb n="87" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0102"/>
them, and never giving them presents on any <lb/>
occasion soever. Yet these children were taught <lb/>
that to give was blessed, and none of them took <lb/>
a greater delight in preparing good things for <lb/>
the poor villagers than did Sarah.</p>
<p>As she grew older she was very fond of <reg orig="read-|ing">reading</reg> <lb/>
about soldiers and warfare&mdash;"Pilgrim's <lb/>
Progress," the "Holy War," and "Stories of <lb/>
Christian Soldiers" being her favourite books for <lb/>
Sunday reading. This seems very strange, as she <lb/>
was, according to her own confession, timid almost <lb/>
to cowardice. Recognising this defect, she set <lb/>
herself diligently to overcome it, delighting to <lb/>
force herself into doing things altogether repellent <lb/>
to her nature.</p>
<p>When the time arrived for Sarah to join her <lb/>
sister at a boarding-school in Brighton, she felt <lb/>
downright rebellious. She had no wish to leave <lb/>
home, and the thought of being shut up in the <lb/>
same house with a lot of strange girls preyed on <lb/>
her mind so much that she cried herself to sleep <lb/>
the first night she spent at school.</p>
<p>She had nothing in common with her sister, <lb/>
rejected the friendly advances of the other girls, <lb/>
and brought down upon her head the just wrath <lb/>
of the teachers by her utter wilfulness; so you <lb/>
may be sure her school-life was far from happy. <lb/>
It was not destined, however, to be a long one, <lb/>
for, while still quite young, she was found to be <lb/>
suffering from curvature of the spine.</p>
<p>Her mother had died a short time before; so, <lb/>
on being taken home, her father devoted a great <lb/>
deal of thought, time, and money to alleviating <lb/>
<pb n="88" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0103"/>
her pain and securing appliances that would, <lb/>
at least, save her from becoming a helpless <lb/>
invalid. By means of a steel support she was <lb/>
able to walk with comparative ease, and it is <lb/>
indeed wonderful to think of the long and trying <lb/>
journeys and arduous labours she afterwards <lb/>
undertook, all for the bettering of the body and <lb/>
soul of the much-despised soldier.</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="II" id="d36">
<head><hi rend="bold">CHAPTER II. <lb/>
Beginning Work.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Though</hi> Sarah had received, in common with <lb/>
her brothers and sister, a sound religious <lb/>
training, she never took any real interest in <lb/>
the teachings of the Bible, till, in August 1851, <lb/>
she was deeply impressed by a sermon preached <lb/>
at Chiddingly Church, Sussex, by the Rev. James <lb/>
Vidal. From this time she earnestly sought <reg orig="guid-|ance">guidance</reg> <lb/>
from the Scriptures, learning from God's <lb/>
Word what she never could know from the <reg orig="con-|tradictory">contradictory</reg> <lb/>
views of the various ministers to whom <lb/>
she had so long listened.</p>
<p>This diligent searching of the Scriptures resulted <lb/>
in a complete change of life. She no longer looked <lb/>
with apathy upon God's Word and work, but was <lb/>
ready to do and to dare all that she now felt called <lb/>
upon by Him to do. Henceforward her life was <lb/>
one of unquestioning obedience to Divine command, <lb/>
and, taking "Ready" for her watchword, despite <lb/>
acute bodily pain and great opposition by parent <lb/>
<pb n="89" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0104"/>
and friends, she steadfastly pressed forward to <lb/>
that goal which is reached only through much <lb/>
toil and tribulation.</p>
<p>Perhaps the first body of Christian workers <lb/>
she joined was a mission in connection with a <lb/>
Presbyterian church in Regent Square, London. <lb/>
Here she did a great deal of good work among the <lb/>
dwellers in the slums and alleys of Somers Town. <lb/>
Conquering a natural repugnance to sickness, she <lb/>
so earnestly devoted herself to these poor people <lb/>
when scarlet fever raged in their midst that she <lb/>
became an expected and welcome visitor.</p>
<p>Her visits to the Middlesex Hospital, later, were <lb/>
always anticipated by the patients with great <lb/>
pleasure, simply because she interested herself in <lb/>
all that they loved best. Her health now required <lb/>
that she should go home and rest; but, though fully <lb/>
aware that her length of life depended upon her <lb/>
spending a certain amount of time upon a couch, <lb/>
she determined to "go till she dropped," as she <lb/>
herself expressed it. Her will power was <reg orig="astonish-|ing">astonishing</reg>, <lb/>
and she determined she would never repine <lb/>
because of her ailment if God would but allow <lb/>
her to <hi rend="italic">work</hi>.</p>
<p>In 1858 the family was obliged to leave <lb/>
Heasmond, owing to large money losses. Mr. <lb/>
Robinson had still a fair fortune left, which he <lb/>
hoped by careful management to leave for the <lb/>
maintenance of his children after his death. So, <lb/>
having spent a short time in Brighton, they finally <lb/>
settled at Boxgrove, near Aldershot. By means <lb/>
of a donkey-carriage Miss Robinson was able to <lb/>
pay frequent visits to the garrison town and to <lb/>
<pb n="90" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0105"/>
Guildford, where, in course of time, she did much <lb/>
good work for the Lord.</p>
<p>The great temptation to sin through drink <lb/>
seemed to her one of the worst evils the men in <lb/>
the garrison had to fight against; so she now <lb/>
began to take a very real interest in temperance <lb/>
work. Being convinced that she would be a <lb/>
greater power for good if she practised what she <lb/>
preached, she decided to sign the pledge. This <lb/>
was in 1861, and her father was very angry <lb/>
indeed about it, as he considered that wine was <lb/>
as necessary to her weakly body as was food. Miss <lb/>
Robinson could now talk to the men on the <lb/>
subject of temperance with greater conviction, for <lb/>
we all know it is much easier to argue from practical <lb/>
experience than from simple theory.</p>
<p>You will remember that, as a child, Sarah was <lb/>
very timid and retiring; this characteristic grew <lb/>
with her growth, so that, when called upon to <lb/>
address a public meeting for the first time, she <lb/>
actually sank upon the platform from sheer fright.</p>
<p>One would suppose that, with constant practice, <lb/>
this timidity would have been overcome; such was <lb/>
not the case, however, and this brave woman had, <lb/>
throughout her long and useful career, to battle <lb/>
stoutly with this failing before being able to carry <lb/>
out the work she felt called upon to do.</p>
<p>The victory once assured, she walked alone into <lb/>
crowded barrack-rooms, penetrated into the vilest <lb/>
abodes of sin, interviewed commanding-officers, <lb/>
spoke with convincing earnestness to drunken <lb/>
brawlers, without apparent fear. Little did those <lb/>
who blamed her for <hi rend="italic">unladylike</hi> and <hi rend="italic">bold</hi> conduct <lb/>
<pb n="91" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0106"/>
realise the inward struggles of this heroic <lb/>
woman.</p>
<p>The evils of war filled her with dismay, and her <lb/>
heart yearned towards the brave fellows whose <lb/>
sufferings during the war in the Crimea touched <lb/>
even the hardest hearts. Though unable herself to <lb/>
join in the good work, she looked with reverence <lb/>
upon the efforts of Miss Florence Nightingale and <lb/>
her devoted band of nurses. The Indian Mutiny, <lb/>
with its countless horrors, once more endeared to <lb/>
her the men who endured so nobly, and great was <lb/>
her astonishment at the contempt in which the <lb/>
soldier was held in and around Aldershot.</p>
<p>Now Sarah Robinson had always sympathised <lb/>
with those whom others blamed, while a popular <lb/>
favourite never attracted her; hence it was that <lb/>
she now began to feel a personal interest in the <lb/>
soldier. The injustice of the scorn in which he <lb/>
was held appealed to her love of right, and from <lb/>
this time she took up the cudgels on his behalf.</p>
<p>Walking boldly into the various houses in which <lb/>
the men found temporary homes, she talked <lb/>
earnestly to them, pointing out how they might <lb/>
improve their lives, and leaving them perfectly <lb/>
assured of her wish to help them. Such was her <lb/>
influence for good with them that many a man <lb/>
not only returned from the evils of drunkenness, <lb/>
but took his first timid and hesitating steps along <lb/>
that narrow way which leadeth to eternal life.</p>
<p>At this time, too, Miss Robinson began her <reg orig="corre-|spondence">correspondence</reg> <lb/>
with men stationed abroad&mdash;a <reg orig="correspon-|dence">correspondence</reg> <lb/>
which has grown to such vast proportions <lb/>
that for some years she has been compelled to have <lb/>
<pb n="92" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0107"/>
much assistance in keeping it up. Soldiers, sailors, <lb/>
seekers after truth&mdash;any, indeed, who need friendly <lb/>
counsel or wholesome advice&mdash;write to her, feeling <lb/>
certain that she is able to help them, and many <lb/>
close and warm friendships have been thus formed.</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="III" id="d37">
<head><hi rend="bold">CHAPTER III. <lb/>
Life at Aldershot.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> first Soldiers' Institute established at <lb/>
Aldershot was a private house taken <reg orig="tem-|porarily">temporarily</reg>, <lb/>
and placed under the care of a Mrs. <lb/>
Daniell, who did much good among the younger <lb/>
officers. With the help of some other earnest <lb/>
workers, and by the efforts of many of the men <lb/>
themselves, she succeeded in raising the soldiers <lb/>
from their low level. Miss Robinson's share in <lb/>
this work lay more with the men than with the <lb/>
officers; indeed, her first sympathy and her life's <lb/>
work was given, not to those who neglected their <lb/>
opportunities, but to those who had no <reg orig="oppor-|tunities">opportunities</reg> <lb/>
to neglect.</p>
<p>She argued, and rightly, too, that it was no use <lb/>
to exhort men to be good while their only places <lb/>
of resort were low-class dancing-saloons, <reg orig="music-|halls">music-halls</reg>, <lb/>
public-houses, and places that were nothing <lb/>
but dens of thieves. Her idea was to show them <lb/>
something better, and fill them with a desire to <lb/>
rise to it; and when she invited a number of <lb/>
soldiers and their wives to take tea with her at <lb/>
Guildford, in June 1863, and afterwards held an <lb/>
<pb n="93" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0108"/>
open-air meeting under a big tree in North Street, <lb/>
the good people of the town were wonder-struck. <lb/>
Later in the evening a most successful meeting <lb/>
was held in the Public Hall, and this Miss <lb/>
Robinson regarded as the crowning effort of <lb/>
the day.</p>
<p>That a <hi rend="italic">lady</hi> should take so real an interest in <lb/>
them was a matter of such great surprise that the <lb/>
men felt drawn toward her in spite of themselves; <lb/>
and her example stimulated other Christians in the <lb/>
town, so that in a very short time general feeling <lb/>
toward the soldier underwent a distinct change <lb/>
for the better.</p>
<p>In October, 1863, the new Institute was finished, <lb/>
and a grand opportunity occurred to prove Miss <lb/>
Robinson's great power of organisation. The <lb/>
week before the opening, Mrs. Daniell asked her <lb/>
to take charge of the housekeeping arrangements, <lb/>
which she willingly agreed to do.</p>
<p>On arriving at the Institute two days before the <lb/>
date of opening, she was horrified to find absolutely <lb/>
nothing ready&mdash;even the builder's dirt and litter <lb/>
still lay on the floors. No servants had been <lb/>
engaged, no furniture ordered; there were no <reg orig="pro-|visions">provisions</reg> <lb/>
in the house, and yet fifty guests had been <lb/>
invited to the opening ceremony!</p>
<p>Having grasped the situation, Miss Robinson <lb/>
obtained the help of about twenty soldiers, who <lb/>
lit fires in all the rooms, scrubbed the floors, <lb/>
cleaned the windows, and helped right manfully <lb/>
in all there was to do. Some ladies who arrived <lb/>
rather inopportunely were set to work hemming <lb/>
sheets and curtains; and General Fleming's widow <lb/>
<pb n="94" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0109"/>
went with Miss Robinson to the various bedrooms, <lb/>
and helped her to make the beds.</p>
<p>The soldiers who saw them thus engaged were <lb/>
filled with profound respect, and one of them <lb/>
afterwards remarked that "A real lady can do <lb/>
anything!"</p>
<p>Thanks to Miss Robinson's capacity for doing <lb/>
things thoroughly, the opening week proved a <lb/>
huge success. A tea for three hundred and fifty <lb/>
people was organised, and a sum of &pound;200 was <lb/>
taken in donations, borrowed articles were <reg orig="re-|turned">returned</reg>, <lb/>
accounts settled, servants engaged, and <lb/>
everything was left in sound working order.</p>
<p>For several years Miss Robinson acted as <lb/>
deputy for Mrs. Daniell at the Institute, directing <lb/>
the household arrangements, taking the weekly <lb/>
mothers' meetings, conducting the Sunday services <lb/>
in the absence of any one specially sent to do <lb/>
so, and finally forming a self-supporting total <lb/>
abstinence society, in which many of the officers <lb/>
showed great interest. In fact, in the short space <lb/>
of ten years, Aldershot became to the soldier a <lb/>
peaceful haven instead of a path to perdition.</p>
<p>And this noble woman's work was not wholly <lb/>
confined to the people of the garrison; for, in her <lb/>
desire to do God's work well, she sought also to <lb/>
influence those from whom she had rescued these <lb/>
men. Once, when seeking a sick woman in a <lb/>
low lodging-house, she found herself inside a <lb/>
thieves' kitchen. A rough-looking fellow <reg orig="in-|stantly">instantly</reg> <lb/>
shut the door and put his back against it.</p>
<p>Although terrified beyond measure, she assumed <lb/>
a calm air and said, "I did not mean to come <lb/>
<pb n="95" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0110"/>
in, but, as I'm here, I'll sing you a song you <lb/>
never heard before." Then she sang to them <lb/>
that hymn so familiar to most of us:&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>'We're bound for the land of the pure and holy,</l>
<l>The home of the happy, the kingdom of love;</l>
<l>Ye wanderers from God in the broad road of folly,</l>
<l>Oh, say, will you go to the Eden above?"</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>To her astonishment all sat in perfect quietness, <lb/>
and even when, having finished singing, she <lb/>
spoke a few simple words about that Eden <lb/>
above, no jeering word, or insulting look, or <lb/>
impatient gesture escaped those men, women, <lb/>
and girls, whose lives had been one continued <lb/>
course of sin.</p>
<p>This proved the beginning of much earnest <lb/>
effort among the dwellers of the courts and alleys <lb/>
of the town, and Miss Robinson found that it <lb/>
was only by visiting them in their own homes <lb/>
that she could reach them. She quite won the <lb/>
hearts of these social outcasts; and when, on <lb/>
leaving Aldershot, she invited some of them to a <lb/>
tea-party in that very kitchen, they told her how <lb/>
sorry they were she was going, and that they <lb/>
should miss her very much.</p>
<p>Owing to some alterations in the management <lb/>
of the Institute, Miss Robinson's services were <lb/>
no longer needed; so she returned to her home <lb/>
near Guildford, where she held some happy little <lb/>
gatherings in the cottages of the villagers, <reg orig="con-|ducted">conducted</reg> <lb/>
a Band of Hope, and instituted a Soldiers' <lb/>
Home, on a small scale, in the house of a <reg orig="farm-|bailiff">farm-bailiff</reg> <lb/>
named Copus, who also was an earnest <lb/>
labourer in the Master's vineyard.</p>

Temperance Work.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">About</hi> this time Miss Robinson wrote a prize <lb/>
essay, called "Looking unto Jesus," for <lb/>
which she received &pound;10; but the good done <lb/>
by this small effort must have been very great, <lb/>
for over 100,000 copies have been circulated, and <lb/>
there is still a steady demand for it.</p>
<p>In 1864 she visited Portsmouth for the first <lb/>
time, having been invited by the men of the <lb/>
69th Regiment to a big tea-meeting they were <lb/>
arranging in the new barracks, Gosport. These <lb/>
were the men to whom she had written so frequently <lb/>
and earnestly while they were stationed in Burma. <lb/>
They had recently returned home, and were <lb/>
anxious not only to meet the kind lady who had <lb/>
been so good to them, but also to hear her speak <lb/>
during the evening meeting.</p>
<p>It was by no means common in those days for a <lb/>
lady to address a public assembly, but so much did <lb/>
her hearers approve of her words that some time <lb/>
later another meeting was arranged, at which, by <lb/>
request, Miss Robinson did most of the speaking. <lb/>
The military authorities now prohibited further <lb/>
gatherings of the kind, as they were not considered <lb/>
good for the maintenance of the necessary discipline <lb/>
among soldiers.</p>
<p>The next few years were spent in visiting the <lb/>
various military stations in the country; and at <lb/>
last Miss Robinson succeeded in getting entered <lb/>
<pb n="97" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0112"/>
in the parliamentary Blue-book as <hi rend="italic">lecturer</hi>, so <lb/>
that she no longer feared to be refused permission <lb/>
to carry on the work which she felt called upon <lb/>
by God to do.</p>
<p>She received goodly grants of Bibles from Tract <lb/>
Societies, and substantial aid from the National <lb/>
Temperance League, which early recognised the <lb/>
value of the steady influence she was fast gaining <lb/>
over the soldiers and their wives. Yet all the <lb/>
while she was suffering acute pain, which became <lb/>
so unbearable at times that the brave woman was <lb/>
compelled to take a brief spell of rest at home.</p>
<p>As soon as her health permitted she resumed <lb/>
her work, striving ever in the teeth of stern <lb/>
opposition, dispiriting failure, and the scarcely <lb/>
veiled sneers of people who spoke of her as "<hi rend="italic">That</hi> <lb/>
Miss Robinson!" So well known in the army did <lb/>
her work at length become, that once, when a lady <lb/>
showed some passing kindness to three men just <lb/>
returned from a foreign station, they insisted on <lb/>
addressing her as <hi rend="italic">Miss Robinson</hi>.</p>
<p>On telling them she was not Miss Robinson, and <lb/>
did not even know her, they replied, "No more do <lb/>
we; but we did not think there was any other lady <lb/>
who would speak to a soldier!" Another man <lb/>
to whom Miss Robinson herself spoke during a <lb/>
railway journey, said, "I have no one belonging <lb/>
to me, miss; you are the first respectable woman <lb/>
who has spoken to me for eight years."</p>
<p>The 46th Regiment was called "Miss Robinson's <lb/>
Own," because in that regiment she first formed <lb/>
a regimental temperance society. There is no <lb/>
doubt that she showed much tact in dealing with <lb/>
<pb n="98" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0113"/>
the men; she got up daintily-laid teas, to which <lb/>
were invited those to whom she wished specially <lb/>
to speak, and the men were not slow to appreciate <lb/>
the cheerful, homelike atmosphere which always <lb/>
seemed to surround their friend. One of them, <lb/>
in speaking of her, said that she was just like a <lb/>
mother with her boys!</p>
<p>And so she was, and a mother to whom the <lb/>
souls of her children were her chief care. She <lb/>
pointed out their faults, told them how to do <lb/>
better, and made them realise that a loving Father <lb/>
was at all times waiting to forgive them and help <lb/>
them to lead higher and nobler lives. The good <lb/>
that she did in the temperance cause alone may <lb/>
be judged from the fact that the yearly number of <lb/>
pledged abstainers reached one thousand!</p>
<p>Of course this meant a great deal of labour and <lb/>
a great deal of money; so the National Temperance <lb/>
League showed their appreciation by helping most <lb/>
liberally. As an instance of the good done in one <lb/>
regiment alone, the fines for drunkenness fell from <lb/>
&pound;57 to &pound;10 in one month! And, that the men might <lb/>
be kept from temptation, a coffee-room, supplied <lb/>
with temperance literature, was established in each <lb/>
regiment whose commanding officer would allow it.</p>
<p>Some time later Miss Robinson was invited to <lb/>
Winchester Jail to speak to the female prisoners, <lb/>
of whom there was a great number at that time. <lb/>
Here her work again met with signal success; and <lb/>
so much was her heart drawn towards these poor <lb/>
creatures, that, had she not already chosen her <lb/>
sphere of labour, she would undoubtedly have <lb/>
devoted her life to them.</p>

<head>"She was like a mother with her boys."</head>
</figure>
<pb n="99" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0115"/>
<p>Visiting Woolwich, Chelsea, the Tower of <lb/>
London, and many other places, she proved <lb/>
herself a very powerful advocate in the cause of <lb/>
temperance among the men stationed there, though <lb/>
she met with most active opposition from the <lb/>
military authorities. Even these, however, she <lb/>
subdued in time, for, like a true Briton, she <lb/>
never acknowledged defeat; to oppose her was <lb/>
simply to call forth her native obstinacy and <lb/>
importunity.</p>
<p>By the aid of the United Kingdom Band of <lb/>
Hope Union she established an Army Band of <lb/>
Hope, "which, at one time, included five-sixths <lb/>
of all the soldiers' children at home and abroad." <lb/>
For five succeeding years she took large numbers <lb/>
of men to the annual meeting of the National <lb/>
Temperance League, held in the Exeter Hall, <lb/>
and, though finding it a great responsibility, she <lb/>
would no doubt have continued but that her work <lb/>
henceforward was chiefly confined to the Institute <lb/>
at Portsmouth. This began in the year 1873, and <lb/>
it is very strange, yet nevertheless perfectly true, <lb/>
that in all the years spent in this and other <lb/>
garrison towns Miss Robinson never saw but <lb/>
one military review.</p>
<p>It was not the glamour that surrounds the <lb/>
warrior which attracted her, but his utter <reg orig="loneli-|ness">loneliness</reg> <lb/>
and the temptations of his life; not the <lb/>
fleeting heart-throb for the victor, which she <lb/>
felt, but the enduring <hi rend="italic">motherliness</hi> towards the <lb/>
victim of neglect and scorn in times of peace. <lb/>
She herself says, "I <hi rend="italic">lived</hi> for them; to seek their <lb/>
welfare became my very life."</p>

<head><hi rend="bold">CHAPTER V. <lb/>
Work in the Camps.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">It</hi> may be remembered that some of Miss <lb/>
Robinson's chief work lay in the <reg orig="corre-|spondence">correspondence</reg> <lb/>
she maintained with men on the <lb/>
foreign stations as well as in the home garrisons. <lb/>
This rapidly grew to enormous proportions, so <lb/>
that for some years she has been compelled to <lb/>
have assistance in coping with it. That her <lb/>
letters gave great pleasure to the men we may <lb/>
be sure, and the following extracts will show <lb/>
what they thought of her work among them.</p>
<p>One man writes: "Permit me to return my <lb/>
sincere thanks for your kind and Christian love <lb/>
to me, a poor soldier. It had been my earnest <lb/>
prayer all that month to have somewhere to go <lb/>
and spend Christmas in quiet from the drunken <lb/>
turmoil of a barrack-room, and then your kind <lb/>
invitation came. I shall never, never forget the <lb/>
happy time I spent at Guildford."</p>
<p>That she filled a vacant place may be gathered <lb/>
from another man's words: "It does a poor <lb/>
soldier good to see a friend like you taking an <lb/>
interest in him; my earnest prayer is that God <lb/>
will bless you for your kindness." The men <lb/>
evidently felt the neglect to which they were <lb/>
subjected, for one remarked: "You are a rarity, <lb/>
for there are very few among Christians who will <lb/>
turn their attention to a soldier;" and another <lb/>
wrote: "Oh, how thankful we who have had the <lb/>
<pb n="101" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0117"/>
honour and pleasure of knowing you ought to <lb/>
be, that there is one lady in England who really <lb/>
cares for the soldier."</p>
<p>Such words speak for themselves; comment <lb/>
is unnecessary; yet one cannot help feeling the <lb/>
underlying pathos of these manly expressions of <lb/>
gratitude. Would it were the right of more of <lb/>
us to deserve such thanks! It must not, <reg orig="how-|ever">however</reg>, <lb/>
be forgotten that Miss Robinson's efforts <lb/>
could not have been so signally successful <lb/>
without the help of the men themselves, their <lb/>
officers in many instances, and other Christian <lb/>
workers, whose hearts were fully as much in all <lb/>
they did, but whose labours were the more <lb/>
effectual because of her good generalship.</p>
<p>And now it seemed to this devoted woman <lb/>
that the time had come when so important a <lb/>
garrison town as Portsmouth should possess a <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">home</hi> for the numbers of men stationed there, as <lb/>
well as for those who spent a short time in the town <lb/>
when being drafted to other stations&mdash;not simply <lb/>
a place in which to eat and sleep, but one where <lb/>
they might enjoy the comforts of a <hi rend="italic">home</hi>, and the <lb/>
pleasures they vainly sought in the low <reg orig="public-|houses">public-houses</reg> <lb/>
and music-halls of the town.</p>
<p>The first Soldiers' Home at Portsmouth was <reg orig="estab-|lished">established</reg> <lb/>
by the Rev. Carus Wilson, about the year <lb/>
1856. He took a very real interest in army men <lb/>
until his death in 1859, when the home was closed <lb/>
on the understanding that the military authorities <lb/>
intended erecting a larger and more commodious <lb/>
building. This was so; but, unfortunately, nothing <lb/>
was done until Miss Robinson, in the year 1871, <lb/>
<pb n="102" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0118"/>
approached some officers of high rank known <lb/>
to be in sympathy with her work, and one or <lb/>
two ladies of whose support she felt certain.</p>
<p>Miss Florence Nightingale, a tried friend of the <lb/>
soldier, had always approved of and encouraged <lb/>
Miss Robinson's labours on his behalf; and Miss <lb/>
Ellice Hopkins, though a confirmed invalid, <lb/>
wrote a book called "Active Service," which <lb/>
was the means of bringing many donations to <lb/>
the Institute fund. This new effort required <lb/>
every moment Miss Robinson could spare from <lb/>
her already existing sphere of action, which now <lb/>
included much good work among the men of <lb/>
the navy, in connection with the Royal Naval <lb/>
Temperance Society.</p>
<p>Her big teapot, which travelled many thousands <lb/>
of miles with her, was the means of establishing <lb/>
a very cordial feeling between the navy and army <lb/>
men, much to the astonishment of those who had <lb/>
prophesied that she would "never get them to mix <lb/>
in a friendly way."</p>
<p>Hearing that the autumn man&oelig;uvres of 1873 <lb/>
were to take place on Dartmoor, the soldier's friend <lb/>
at once applied for permission to erect a group <lb/>
of tents there, in connection with the National <lb/>
Temperance League, for the supply of hot coffee <lb/>
and tea, food-stuffs, and non-intoxicating drinks, <lb/>
during the encampment. There was the usual <lb/>
amount of opposition to be overcome, and a most <lb/>
unusual amount of discomfort to be endured, <lb/>
but with her customary pluck Miss Robinson <lb/>
determined to see it through.</p>
<p>Picture to yourself this delicate woman, in <lb/>
<pb n="103" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0119"/>
addition to organising so vast an undertaking, <lb/>
working from four in the morning till ten at <lb/>
night superintending the cooking, cutting up, and <lb/>
sale of provisions to such of ten thousand men <lb/>
as came to buy; besides writing letters for many, <lb/>
sending away money-orders to wives and families, <lb/>
and supplying postage-stamps by the hundred.</p>
<p>Her only refuge was an old gipsy van, by no <lb/>
means rainproof, in which she passed the nights <lb/>
in fear and trembling, frequently finding herself, <lb/>
when morning dawned, wet to the skin; for <lb/>
Dartmoor has a very unenviable reputation for <lb/>
soaking rains. It is, then, not at all surprising <lb/>
that she traces a distinct failing in health to the <lb/>
nine weeks passed under such trying <reg orig="circum-|stances">circumstances</reg>. <lb/>
The wonder is how she contrived to <lb/>
live through them.</p>
<p>Besides several soldiers who volunteered for the <lb/>
work, she had a very faithful and efficient helper <lb/>
in one Tufnell, of the Queen's Bays, who actually <lb/>
purchased his discharge in order to accompany her <lb/>
to Dartmoor. From that time forward she had in <lb/>
him a staunch and ever-ready friend, though at <lb/>
first his mettle was well tested by jeering comrades.</p>
<p>Finding that a second campaign was to take <lb/>
place at Cannock Chase, Miss Robinson went <lb/>
forward by a quick train to make the necessary <lb/>
arrangements for the erection and provisioning of <lb/>
a similar group of tents there: the personal <reg orig="dis-|comfort">discomfort</reg> <lb/>
at Dartmoor was quite forgotten in the <lb/>
hope of again helping the men she loved so well. <lb/>
The manner of the commanding-officer was by <lb/>
no means encouraging; but, as usual, she rose <lb/>
<pb n="104" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0120"/>
superior to all obstacles, and was gratified not <lb/>
only by the good results achieved, but also by <lb/>
the praise accorded to herself and helpers by the <lb/>
leading newspapers of the day.</p>
<p>Similar man&oelig;uvres were held the following year <lb/>
at Aldershot; but, though the same amount of <lb/>
good was done by herself and staff, Miss Robinson <lb/>
seems to think her own work at that time not worth <lb/>
mentioning, because she lived very comfortably in <lb/>
a furniture van, and had thoughtful and kindly <lb/>
attention paid her by Lady Grant!</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="VI" id="d40">
<head><hi rend="bold">CHAPTER VI. <lb/>
The Portsmouth Institute.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">For</hi> a short time longer this noble woman <lb/>
resumed her work of visiting the different <lb/>
military stations, but now with the avowed <lb/>
purpose of raising funds for the erection of the <lb/>
Institute at Portsmouth, upon which she had set <lb/>
her heart. The untiring energy she threw into <lb/>
this project would have done credit to a woman <lb/>
of great physical strength; yet we know how <lb/>
really frail Miss Robinson was, and she is fain <lb/>
to acknowledge that at times these journeys were <lb/>
made in great agony of body and distress of <lb/>
mind.</p>
<p>At last sufficient money had been collected to <lb/>
make a beginning, but when it became known <lb/>
that Miss Robinson proposed to hold Bible-classes <lb/>
and total abstinence meetings in the Institute, the <lb/>
<pb n="105" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0121"/>
resident military chaplain deliberately set his face <lb/>
against the scheme, and the War Office retracted <lb/>
their promise of a suitable site.</p>
<p>Nothing daunted, however, Miss Robinson now <lb/>
sought a house in the town that might answer her <lb/>
purpose, for she decided that she could do nothing <lb/>
without the Bible, and resisted all temptations to <lb/>
relinquish her proposed Bible-classes.</p>
<p>In the High Street of Portsmouth there stood <lb/>
an old inn, known as "The Fountain," which <lb/>
had been closed for some time. It was a roomy, <lb/>
quaint old place, with big stable-yards surrounded <lb/>
by tiny cottages, and having a long room running <lb/>
through to an adjoining street. With the <reg orig="con-|sent">consent</reg> <lb/>
of her London provisional committee, Miss <lb/>
Robinson decided to take this place, which, with <lb/>
a few alterations, would make a capital Soldiers' <lb/>
Home.</p>
<p>Even now opposition was not at an end, for <lb/>
the local collecting committee altogether <reg orig="dis-|approved">disapproved</reg> <lb/>
of the plan, and a year later they <reg orig="re-|signed">resigned</reg>. <lb/>
Still the brave woman battled on, lecturing <lb/>
in various towns, writing begging letters, attending <lb/>
drawing-room meetings, till at last a sum of &pound;7000 <lb/>
had been raised. Tufnell, the faithful old Queen's <lb/>
Bay, and his wife and family had taken possession <lb/>
of the Fountain the previous Christmas; workmen <lb/>
had been engaged there for some months, and, in <lb/>
September 1874, the Institute was formally opened <lb/>
by General Sir James Hope Grant.</p>
<p>At the evening meeting a beautifully illuminated <lb/>
address was presented to Sir Arthur Lawrence for <lb/>
Miss Robinson, who, owing to illness, was unable <lb/>
<pb n="106" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0122"/>
to be present. This was the soldiers' tribute to <lb/>
one who, through long years of purposeful <reg orig="en-|deavour">endeavour</reg>, <lb/>
unflagging zeal, and generous <reg orig="self-|sacrifice">self-sacrifice</reg>, <lb/>
had justified her title of "Friend of the <lb/>
Soldier."</p>
<p>The Institute is really a well-organised club as <lb/>
well as a home, for it has a reading and writing <lb/>
room, reception-rooms in which the soldiers may <lb/>
meet their friends, non-commissioned officers' <lb/>
room, a large lecture-hall, and fine dormitories <lb/>
capable of holding seventy beds if needed. <lb/>
Cheap dinners and teas may be obtained at regular <lb/>
hours, and the friends and relatives of soldiers are <lb/>
always sure of a hearty welcome. The total cost <lb/>
of the building amounted to &pound;20,000, and the <lb/>
cost of maintaining it is partly met by voluntary <lb/>
contributions.</p>
<p>At the present time the efforts of the ladies who <lb/>
manage the Institute are strictly confined to the <lb/>
welfare of service men and their families. At <reg orig="half-|past">half-past</reg> <lb/>
three on Sunday afternoons a Bible-class for <lb/>
soldiers is held, followed by a social tea, at which <lb/>
the ladies always join the men. At seven o'clock <lb/>
in the evening a public service is held in the <lb/>
large hall. On Wednesday evening a social <lb/>
gathering is held, at which ladies from the <reg orig="neigh-|bourhood">neighbourhood</reg> <lb/>
help to make the time pass pleasantly <lb/>
by taking part in the musical programme; and <lb/>
all present are given hot coffee and cake at nine <lb/>
o'clock.</p>
<p>During the week there are meetings of the <lb/>
Soldiers' Christian Association, Bible-classes, and <lb/>
Prayer-meetings; and, in the winter, one evening <lb/>
<pb n="107" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0123"/>
is usually devoted to an entertainment in which <lb/>
dissolving views take a prominent part. There <lb/>
is, too, a weekly mothers' meeting, as well as a <lb/>
children's meeting; and during the year there are <lb/>
pleasant outings, teas, and treats of various kinds.</p>
<p>It will thus be seen that those who so kindly <lb/>
volunteer for this work find plenty to do; and yet, <lb/>
owing to the fact that the present management <lb/>
has but the Portsmouth Institute and the branch <lb/>
for trooping work at Southampton to attend to, <lb/>
this is but a small proportion of that which was <lb/>
organised and carried on in the earlier years of <lb/>
Miss Robinson's management.</p>
<p>When this lady took up residence at the Soldiers' <lb/>
Institute, she had the assistance of several ladies, <lb/>
ten servants, and Tufnell, besides a good deal of <lb/>
outside help, in the conduct of the various meetings <lb/>
which were successfully organised.</p>
<p>A monthly Communion Service was held, and a <lb/>
regular system of house to house visiting instituted. <lb/>
In spite of the numerous claims on her time, Miss <lb/>
Robinson yearned to do something for the <reg orig="better-|ing">bettering</reg> <lb/>
of the conditions under which the sailor boys <lb/>
of the navy lived. An idea once conceived became <lb/>
with her a duty to be fulfilled; so in time she <lb/>
contrived to have two very large rooms built at <lb/>
the end of the Institute garden for their <reg orig="accommoda-|tion">accommodation</reg>, <lb/>
and during her life this work was successfully <lb/>
carried on by Miss Rose of Southsea.</p>
<p>For the convenience of the men employed in <lb/>
the dockyard, Miss Robinson next succeeded in <lb/>
establishing a "Sailors' Welcome" at Portsea, <lb/>
by means of a specially-raised fund, to which she <lb/>
<pb n="108" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0124"/>
herself contributed &pound;1000. The fisher-folk and <lb/>
waterside people were cared for by the opening of <lb/>
an early coffee-house and mission-room, the work <lb/>
of which was afterwards merged in a branch of <lb/>
the Institute situated in Nobbs Lane, and largely <lb/>
conducted by soldiers who spared neither time, <lb/>
money, nor spiritual effort in doing unto others <lb/>
as they themselves had been done unto. Since <lb/>
1893, this place has been in the hands of the <lb/>
Salvation Army, whose officers have ably continued <lb/>
the work so well begun.</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="VII" id="d41">
<head><hi rend="bold">CHAPTER VII. <lb/>
Retirement.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> Egyptian War of 1883 once more awoke <lb/>
in Miss Robinson's heart an intense longing <lb/>
to do something for the men who were yet <lb/>
again called upon to fight for their country far <lb/>
from home and kindred. The founding of a home <lb/>
at Alexandria, similar to that at Portsmouth, <lb/>
seemed to be the best way of helping them; so <lb/>
Tufnell was sent to Egypt to see what could be <lb/>
done. A site was purchased, an old iron church <lb/>
was bought at Brompton and sent to Alexandria <lb/>
to be used during the erection of a permanent stone <lb/>
building, and Miss Robinson set about getting the <lb/>
necessary funds.</p>
<p>The actual amount spent on the building and <lb/>
furnishing of this Institute was &pound;12,250, of which <lb/>
Miss Robinson gave &pound;900, in addition to lending <lb/>
<pb n="109" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0125"/>
all her available money&mdash;the remainder being <reg orig="col-|lected">collected</reg> <lb/>
and subscribed by many kind friends. It <lb/>
is a noble building, and has proved of inestimable <lb/>
benefit not only to soldiers and sailors, but also to <lb/>
the many English-speaking men whose work lies <lb/>
in this important Egyptian town.</p>
<p>It would seem to an ordinary person that such <lb/>
huge undertakings carried to a successful issue <lb/>
would have been sufficient work for one lifetime: <lb/>
Miss Robinson, being anything but an ordinary <lb/>
person, thought otherwise, as the opening of the <lb/>
"Speedwell Coffee Palace" and Mission Hall, at <lb/>
Landport, in 1890, at a cost of &pound;30,000, besides <lb/>
various smaller places, prove.</p>
<p>The "Marine View Hotel" was also bought <lb/>
and fitted up for the use of officers, and towards <lb/>
this the soldiers' friend gave no less than &pound;2700. <lb/>
This place was situated next to the Institute, and, <lb/>
from the character of the people who frequented it, <lb/>
had been a great nuisance to the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>But the time came when this brave, enduring <lb/>
woman could do no more. She had travelled <lb/>
thousands of miles in a specially-built invalid <lb/>
coach; she had addressed thousands of people all <lb/>
over Great Britain; she had collected thousands <lb/>
of pounds, and she must have been instrumental <lb/>
in arresting the steps of thousands of people who, <lb/>
from lack of a guiding hand, had chosen the broad <lb/>
road to perdition.</p>
<p>In 1893 she was compelled to resign all active <lb/>
share in the management of the numerous <reg orig="institu-|tions">institutions</reg>, <lb/>
including that at Alexandria. Having made <lb/>
all necessary arrangements for their future successful <lb/>
<pb n="110" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0126"/>
working, she retired to a small house she had built <lb/>
for herself at Burley, in the New Forest. Here she <lb/>
spent five restful years, with her devoted friend, <lb/>
Miss Walker, and a favourite cat as companions; <lb/>
but, owing to the resignation of the honorary <lb/>
superintendent of the Portsmouth Institute, she <lb/>
then returned for a short time to re-organise the <lb/>
inner working of the home.</p>
<p>She was accompanied by Miss Walker&mdash;who <lb/>
had, for over twenty years, been connected with <lb/>
the work both at home and abroad&mdash;and another <lb/>
trusty lady helper of great experience. She soon <lb/>
restored the old order of affairs, and the men <lb/>
were quick to show their appreciation of the <lb/>
return of the ladies&mdash;though, greatly to the regret <lb/>
of all, Miss Robinson was again obliged to leave <lb/>
the management in other hands. One of the men <lb/>
remarked that the Institute without Miss Robinson <lb/>
was like home without a mother!</p>
<p>Miss Walker now acts for her, supervises all <lb/>
correspondence, and, during the recent war in the <lb/>
Transvaal, has had her powers of resource greatly <lb/>
tried by the trooping work at Southampton.</p>
<p>In the peaceful solitude of her forest home <lb/>
the soldiers' friend is by no means idle. She <lb/>
still edits the monthly magazine <hi rend="italic">Ready</hi>, which, <lb/>
together with "Yarns" and numerous leaflets and <lb/>
pamphlets, has a very large circulation. These <lb/>
publications have been, and still are, of untold <lb/>
benefit to soldiers all over the world, who prize <lb/>
them, not only for their intrinsic merit, but for the <lb/>
sake of the writer.</p>
<p>There are men still living who remember what <lb/>
<pb n="111" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0127"/>
the soldier was and what he is; and who also <lb/>
know the battle fought by this brave woman <lb/>
against contumely, scurrilous attacks of <reg orig="news-|paper">newspaper</reg> <lb/>
men, organised opposition, and frequent <lb/>
dispiriting failures amongst those she toiled so <lb/>
diligently to benefit; and they know, too, that she <lb/>
came through all "More than conqueror through <lb/>
Him that loved us."</p>
<p>The various homes and institutes, established <lb/>
through her untiring energy and indomitable <lb/>
pluck, will be very real monuments to her memory; <lb/>
but, to many minds, the greatest monument of <lb/>
all will be the number of souls now waiting to <lb/>
welcome her to that temple not made by hands, <lb/>
in the city whose builder and maker is God.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Have</hi> you ever wondered why most of us have <lb/>
a warm corner in our hearts for a sailor? Is <lb/>
it because he was the first of our sons to <lb/>
leave home and kindred, to brave the dangers of <lb/>
unknown seas&mdash;not <lb/>
merely from a spirit of <lb/>
adventure, but to <reg orig="un-|ravel">unravel</reg>, <lb/>
for the benefit <lb/>
of later generations, <lb/>
the mystery of all that <lb/>
lay beyond them?</p>
<figure id="f8" rend="inline" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0128"/>
<p>For the absent, one <lb/>
has ever-growing <lb/>
affection; but, should <lb/>
there be the least <lb/>
doubt of the ultimate <lb/>
return of the dear one, that affection becomes all <lb/>
the more intense. Then, too, the sailor is usually <lb/>
so glad to be on shore once more that his return <lb/>
brightens all with whom he comes in contact. His <lb/>
hearty laugh, his genuine hand-grip, his unaffected <lb/>
pleasure on meeting with friends, all combine to <lb/>
make us regard him as the jolly fellow the true <lb/>
sailor really is.</p>
<p>Years ago his lot was no enviable one, for ships <lb/>
were then very small, being built chiefly for trading <lb/>
purposes, and the accommodation for both officers <lb/>
<pb n="113" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0129"/>
and crew was very scanty. There were no <reg orig="steam-|ships">steamships</reg>, <lb/>
and the sailing vessels were often months <lb/>
at sea without once touching land. There were <lb/>
no preserved foods as there are to-day, and the <lb/>
sailors lived during these long voyages chiefly <lb/>
upon salt provisions, and water by no means fresh, <lb/>
with the result that whole crews were frequently <lb/>
laid low with a dreadful disease known as scurvy.</p>
<p>Yet, nothing daunted, they again and again faced <lb/>
not only possible death from drowning but also the <lb/>
certainty of disease, which also might cost them <lb/>
their lives. What wonder, then, that the brave <lb/>
fellows were looked upon with love and admiration <lb/>
by all&mdash;that their good points were made much <lb/>
more of, and their errors much less of, than those <lb/>
of men who passed their lives ashore?</p>
<p>Be the reason what it may, it is nevertheless <lb/>
true that, even in these days of short voyages and <lb/>
lessened discomfort, of steamships and better food, <lb/>
we still "all love Jack," whether his life be spent <lb/>
on a barque or an ocean greyhound, a <reg orig="fishing-|smack">fishing-smack</reg> <lb/>
or an armour-plated man-o'-war.</p>
<p>To the men of the last class is usually given the <lb/>
name of Blue-Jackets, or Jack Tars, and it is with <lb/>
these more especially we have to do in this brief <lb/>
sketch of Miss Weston and her life's work. Many <lb/>
of them join the Royal Navy when quite young <lb/>
boys, and are placed on training-ships, educated, <lb/>
and taught all that can possibly help them to <lb/>
become efficient members of that navy which has <lb/>
ever been our boast, and which to-day ranks first <lb/>
amongst the fleets of civilised nations.</p>
<p>The duties of a Jack Tar are numerous, while his <lb/>
<pb n="114" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0130"/>
hours of leisure are few; therefore, when he comes <lb/>
ashore he does so with the fullest intention of <lb/>
having a good time. Some years ago, Jack's <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">good time</hi> was anything but good for him. As a <lb/>
rule he had some money to spend, and <reg orig="unprin-|cipled">unprincipled</reg> <lb/>
persons, knowing this, made a regular <lb/>
trade of helping him to get rid of it quickly.</p>
<p>They met him with hearty greetings, and <reg orig="pre-|tended">pretended</reg> <lb/>
to be his friends, while really they were his <lb/>
worst enemies. They took him to low drinking <lb/>
shops and music-halls, and, having obtained all <lb/>
they could from him, left him to lie by the <reg orig="road-|side">roadside</reg> <lb/>
till he was taken charge of by the police, or <lb/>
wakened to find himself cold, miserable, and <lb/>
penniless, with the knowledge that he had broken <lb/>
his leave and would have to suffer for it.</p>
<p>The particular port in which his ship was lying, <lb/>
was, more often than not, many miles from home <lb/>
and friends; so Jack had to take lodgings where <lb/>
he could get them, and, unhappily, he frequently <lb/>
left them a sadder if not a wiser man. He was <lb/>
not scorned by civilians, as was the soldier; but <lb/>
he was quite as much neglected until Miss Agnes <lb/>
Weston took up his cause, and devoted herself to <lb/>
the improvement of his life.</p>
<p>She was the daughter of a rich and learned <lb/>
barrister, and, though born in London, spent <lb/>
the greater part of her life previous to her work <lb/>
among seamen, near Bath. She was a <reg orig="strong-|willed">strong-willed</reg>, <lb/>
energetic child, with great possibilities for <lb/>
either good or evil, and was very fond of music.</p>
<p>Though taken regularly to church, she felt no <lb/>
interest in either prayers or sermons until she <lb/>
<pb n="115" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0131"/>
reached the age of sixteen, when her attention <lb/>
was arrested by some words spoken by the Rev. <lb/>
James Fleming, who at that time was incumbent <lb/>
of All Saints' Chapel, Bath.</p>
<p>Her state of indifference to God's Word ceased, <lb/>
but many years passed before she found that peace <lb/>
which passeth all understanding. She longed to <lb/>
take her difficulties to some wise and godly friend, <lb/>
yet she shrank from laying bare her soul to any <lb/>
but the Father Himself. She threw herself heartily <lb/>
into district-visiting and Sunday-school teaching, <lb/>
yet felt herself to be still very far from that <lb/>
kingdom of which she spoke so much and so <lb/>
often.</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="II" id="d44">
<head><hi rend="bold">CHAPTER II. <lb/>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> time came at last&mdash;how or when she knew <lb/>
not&mdash;when she was conscious of being able <lb/>
to deliver God's message to young and old, <lb/>
yea even to the dying, with a conviction of its <lb/>
truth never before realised. She devoted more <lb/>
and more of her time and thoughts to His work, <lb/>
and her visits to the Bath United Hospital became <lb/>
bright spots in the lives of its weary, suffering <lb/>
inmates.</p>
<p>The Rector of Walcot, near Bath, found her <lb/>
services of great value in the formation and <lb/>
working of Bible-classes for men, as well as in <lb/>
temperance work of all kinds. She was not at <lb/>
first a total abstainer; but finding it difficult to <lb/>
<pb n="116" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0132"/>
convince men that even moderate drinking was <lb/>
productive of evil while still a moderate drinker <lb/>
herself, she took the pledge, and found that <reg orig="there-|after">thereafter</reg> <lb/>
her arguments had greater power for good, <lb/>
while her health was visibly improved.</p>
<p>When a body of the 2nd Somerset Militia <lb/>
was sent to Bath for training, Miss Weston <lb/>
spent a great deal of time among them. Coffee <lb/>
and reading rooms were opened, social meetings <lb/>
arranged, Sunday-classes formed, prayer-meetings <lb/>
held, and temperance addresses given to the men, <lb/>
with the happiest results; while, before the camp <lb/>
was broken up, the colonel allowed Miss Weston <lb/>
to give each man a Testament, and was very <lb/>
generous in his praise of the good achieved by <lb/>
her devoted exertions on the men's behalf.</p>
<p>This work among the militiamen has been <reg orig="con-|tinued">continued</reg> <lb/>
by her sister, for, from this time forward, <lb/>
Miss Weston's whole energy was given to the <lb/>
men of the Royal Navy; and, strangely enough, <lb/>
her first work among sailors was due to a letter <lb/>
written by her to a soldier going to India on a <lb/>
troop-ship. This letter proved of so great comfort <lb/>
to him that he showed it to one of the sailors. <lb/>
The man was so delighted with it that he said <lb/>
he should like Miss Weston to write to him just <lb/>
such a letter, but he greatly doubted if she would. <lb/>
The soldier, however, felt quite sure that she <lb/>
would, and wrote to her on the subject. Of <lb/>
course she at once sent a helpful, cheery letter <lb/>
to the sailor, and that letter was the beginning <lb/>
of a correspondence which is now so enormous <lb/>
that 21,000 printed copies are issued monthly.</p>

<pb entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0134"/>
<pb n="117" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0135"/>
<p>They are sent to all parts of the world, and are <lb/>
looked forward to with great pleasure by seamen, <lb/>
Royal Marines, Marine Artillery, coast-guardsmen, <lb/>
and lighthouse keepers, while even men of other <lb/>
navies read them with the keenest interest. <lb/>
Through them many firm and helpful friendships <lb/>
have been formed, men on distant stations kept in <lb/>
touch with home, and not a few pilgrims started <lb/>
on the heavenward journey who otherwise would <lb/>
have strayed or been led aside from the right <lb/>
path.</p>
<p>The invalids in the great naval hospitals, the <lb/>
deep-sea fishermen, even the soldiers on the <reg orig="out-|going">outgoing</reg> <lb/>
troop-ships eagerly anticipate the monthly <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Blue-Back</hi>, as Miss Weston's letter is lovingly <lb/>
called; while the younger blue-jackets have a <lb/>
specially-written letter of their own.</p>
<p>They failed to grasp the full meaning of her <lb/>
message to the older men; so they asked her to <lb/>
kindly write one for themselves. This she willingly <lb/>
consented to do, and it has been found so welcome <lb/>
that some thousands of copies are sent each month <lb/>
to the boys on the naval training-ships and stations.</p>
<p>Her words are simple and straightforward, and <lb/>
can be understood by all; they appeal to the <lb/>
hearts of the sailors, and their effect on the <lb/>
general conduct of the men is such that the <lb/>
officers are quite glad to help forward Miss <lb/>
Weston's work to the utmost of their power.</p>
<p>She is now a welcome visitor on any of H.M. <lb/>
ships, though at first her visits were regarded with <lb/>
doubt. Naval officers then strongly opposed the <lb/>
introduction of temperance work among their <lb/>
<pb n="118" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0136"/>
men; but now they have proved that true courage <lb/>
requires no stimulant in the shape of alcohol, <lb/>
while the most reliable men are found among <lb/>
those who have come within the sphere of Miss <lb/>
Weston's influence.</p>
<p>Possibly they would have regarded the work <lb/>
with more interest had it been begun by a man; <lb/>
but that a woman should put herself forward <lb/>
publicly was thought, in those days, to be most <lb/>
unbecoming and unlady-like, and all who so <lb/>
ventured were looked upon as courting notoriety <lb/>
at the cost of womanly modesty.</p>
<p>We have seen the contumely with which Miss <lb/>
Robinson was treated by many; even Elizabeth <lb/>
Fry and Sister Dora failed to escape the covert <lb/>
sneers of a few; but let us thank God that these <lb/>
noble women did so boldly come forward to <lb/>
fulfil woman's real destiny&mdash;of succouring the weak <lb/>
and erring, of ministering to the sick and needy, <lb/>
of setting an example of Christian endeavour to <lb/>
those who, while conscientiously doing their duty <lb/>
in their homes and families, neglect to heed the <lb/>
Divine command, "Bear ye one another's burdens."</p>

Sowing the Seed.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Miss weston's</hi> interest now became <reg orig="en-|tirely">entirely</reg> <lb/>
centred in our blue-jackets and their <lb/>
bodily and spiritual welfare. After having <lb/>
spent a great deal of time in making God's Word <lb/>
<pb n="119" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0137"/>
known to them, one fact became very evident to <lb/>
her, and this was, that, until she could in some <lb/>
measure wean the men from the drink habit, her <lb/>
efforts would meet with but little real success.</p>
<p>With the assistance of Admiral Sir W. King <lb/>
Hall, and the organising agent of the National <lb/>
Temperance League, she began a steady crusade <lb/>
against the use of alcohol; and it is pleasing to <lb/>
know that in a short time she obtained the names <lb/>
of many men who pledged themselves to refrain, <lb/>
with God's help, from strong drink for the <lb/>
remainder of their lives.</p>
<p>Her addresses to the sailors on their own ships <lb/>
were much appreciated, and on one occasion a <lb/>
number of men signed their names in the <reg orig="pledge-|book">pledge-book</reg> <lb/>
while it lay on a <hi rend="italic">grog-tub</hi> in default of a <lb/>
table! One of the men, after signing his name, <lb/>
struck his hand playfully on the tub, saying as <lb/>
he did so, "There goes a nail in your coffin, old <lb/>
fellow!" The commander, who was standing <lb/>
near, took up the book, and, having counted the <lb/>
names, remarked, "Sixty odd nails to-day; if <lb/>
they all hold firm, I won't give much for the old <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">grog-tub's</hi> life!"</p>
<p>The beginning of this work was not <reg orig="encourag-|ing">encouraging</reg>, <lb/>
but, like a good many other <hi rend="italic">bad beginningss,</hi> <lb/>
it has had a very good ending; for now there is <lb/>
no ship in the British navy but carries a number <lb/>
of men who are not merely pledged abstainers, <lb/>
but earnest Christians and examples of right <lb/>
living and purposeful endeavour to all around <lb/>
them.</p>
<p>Miss Weston has been thanked by various <lb/>
<pb n="120" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0138"/>
members of our Royal Family, as well as by <lb/>
highly-placed naval officials; but even such thanks <lb/>
cannot be so gratifying to her as the very obvious <lb/>
results of her life's work.</p>
<p>Once, while on a visit to Devonport, she noticed <lb/>
with dismay that the boys of the Royal Navy <lb/>
seemed to have absolutely nothing to do on the <lb/>
Sabbath but to walk about the streets in an aimless <lb/>
manner. She thought so much about it, indeed, <lb/>
that she at length determined to try to get them <lb/>
together for a quiet little service during the <reg orig="after-|noon">afternoon</reg> <lb/>
of that day. Her first efforts were not <lb/>
successful; but, though discouraged somewhat, <lb/>
she determined not to give it up.</p>
<p>At last a good friend offered Miss Weston the <lb/>
use of her kitchen, and promised to provide tea <lb/>
and cakes for all the boys who came. By the <lb/>
aid of two earnest Christian men a dozen sailor <lb/>
lads were induced to come in, and, in course of <lb/>
time, the kitchen became so crowded with eager <lb/>
listeners that their friend was obliged to seek a <lb/>
larger room in which to hold the meetings.</p>
<p>She chose a very large one close to the place <lb/>
where the boys landed from their boats, and this <lb/>
was filled Sunday after Sunday; for the good <lb/>
lady's simply-spoken messages of Christ took <lb/>
hold of the lads, and sank as good seed into <lb/>
fertile ground, bringing forth as fruit true-living, <lb/>
sober, Christian men, many of whom are still the <lb/>
backbone of Britain's Royal Navy.</p>
<p>As the boys grew accustomed to these meetings <lb/>
and learned that Miss Weston was really trying to <lb/>
do them good, they began to regard her with <lb/>
<pb n="121" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0139"/>
sincere affection; and, as perfect love casteth out <lb/>
all fear, they boldly besought their friend to <reg orig="pro-|vide">provide</reg> <lb/>
for them a place in which they could meet <lb/>
during the week for further gospel meetings and <lb/>
temperance work!</p>
<p>The need of such a place had been present <lb/>
in Miss Weston's mind for some time, but she <lb/>
recognised that a large sum of money would be <lb/>
required to establish a suitable building. How <lb/>
was this to be raised? While the question of <lb/>
ways and means was occupying her thoughts, a <lb/>
large old-fashioned house, quite close to the <lb/>
Royal dockyard gates, fell vacant. This house <lb/>
Miss Weston determined to secure, and trust to <lb/>
God's people to provide the necessary funds.</p>
<p>Her faith was fully rewarded, for, in a <reg orig="compara-|tively">comparatively</reg> <lb/>
short time, &pound;6000 were raised&mdash;a sum which <lb/>
not only bought the building, but furnished it with <lb/>
every requisite. Her appeals for help in the <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>, collections made by her during long <lb/>
and weary journeys, subscriptions from distant <lb/>
lands, contributions both small and great from <lb/>
the blue-jackets themselves as well as from many <lb/>
of their relatives, all helped to realise this noble <lb/>
sum, and to-day "The Royal Sailors' Rest" <lb/>
stands, occupying a prominent position in the main <lb/>
street of Devonport, a silent yet eloquent witness <lb/>
of what willing workers can achieve.</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="IV" id="d46">
<pb n="122" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0140"/>
<head><hi rend="bold">CHAPTER IV. <lb/>
The Royal Sailors' Rest.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">A simple</hi> but impressive meeting was held <lb/>
in the hall of the new building on the <lb/>
evening of 7th May, 1876, when it was <lb/>
announced that hot tea, coffee, and cocoa, with rolls <lb/>
and butter, would be ready for the men when going <lb/>
to their work the following morning. The blessing <lb/>
of God upon the Institute was earnestly besought, <lb/>
and "The Sailors' Rest" was declared open.</p>
<p>The 8th of May dawned bright and clear, and, <lb/>
rather before the servants were prepared, the <lb/>
customers began to flock into the comfortable, <lb/>
cheery-looking bar. That was a busy day for all <lb/>
in the new <hi rend="italic">public-house</hi>&mdash;for it was a <hi rend="italic">public-house</hi> <lb/>
in every sense; though man, woman, or boy <lb/>
could obtain nothing therein with which the <lb/>
senses might be stolen away.</p>
<p>No intoxicant of any kind can be bought in this <lb/>
public-house; but hot, comforting drinks and good <lb/>
wholesome food may be purchased by anyone on <lb/>
payment of a very moderate price. Beyond the <lb/>
bar, however, none but sailors may pass; for the <lb/>
Home was founded for the benefit of sea-faring <lb/>
men, and a true home it is to both boys and <lb/>
men.</p>
<p>Comfortable cabins can be had at a charge <lb/>
within reach of anyone; and when all the beds <lb/>
are full, shake-downs are arranged in various parts <lb/>
of the building, for the men will accommodate <lb/>
<pb n="123" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0141"/>
themselves to circumstances rather than leave the <lb/>
shelter of their home.</p>
<p>Even the poor weak fellow, hopelessly senseless <lb/>
from strong drink, finds here a refuge, while the <lb/>
manager and his assistants are ever ready to lend <lb/>
a helping hand in guiding these foolish men into <lb/>
straighter paths. A pledge-book always lies open <lb/>
on the counter, and, though it is never obtruded <lb/>
upon the notice of customers, many a name has <lb/>
been signed in it through the kindly tact of those <lb/>
who wait upon them.</p>
<p>In the same way, an entrance to the adjoining <lb/>
hall is open to the sailors, but they are never <lb/>
pressed to attend the meetings. Miss Weston <lb/>
knows the sailor-man well, and acts upon her <lb/>
knowledge with the happiest results; for through <lb/>
the open door comes the sound of voices joined <lb/>
in harmonious praise of Him who dwells on high. <lb/>
No sailor can resist good singing; so many a <lb/>
one, attracted thus, enters the hall, and in due <lb/>
time becomes one of God's own children.</p>
<p>The whole of the mission work in connection <lb/>
with the Institute is carried on in this hall, and <lb/>
all who like to enter are cordially welcomed to <lb/>
any part of the building except that containing <lb/>
the seats specially reserved for the use of the <lb/>
sailors.</p>
<p>The interior of the Rest comprises rooms for <lb/>
recreation, reading, smoking, and dining, while <lb/>
there are also comfortable sitting-rooms generously <lb/>
supplied with books, papers, and writing materials, <lb/>
and all these are free to the men who use the house.</p>
<p>The younger blue-jackets have an entrance, <lb/>
<pb n="124" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0142"/>
coffee-bar, reading and recreation room of their <lb/>
own. Billiards, chess, draughts, and other games <lb/>
are among their amusements, and a good piano is <lb/>
also provided. On Sundays and Thursdays they <lb/>
meet here, and on the latter day, after having had <lb/>
a pleasant game, they adjourn to Miss Weston's <lb/>
room for a Bible-class meeting, or to another room <lb/>
where they join in hearty singing of Sankey's <lb/>
hymns, of which all our blue-jackets are very fond, <lb/>
and to listen to a good address.</p>
<p>The public bar has been a boon to the wives of <lb/>
the men who have to visit that quarter of the town <lb/>
on business, for here they can procure good <lb/>
refreshment and rest amid surroundings that are <lb/>
far more likely to raise than to lower their moral <lb/>
characters; for all who frequent this bar seem to <lb/>
know that both speech and action must be in <lb/>
accord with the spirit of the place.</p>
<p>Miss Weston's idea in founding this Institute, <lb/>
was that it should be entirely self-supporting, <lb/>
which has proved to be the case; and it is indeed <lb/>
gratifying to all concerned that the first year's <lb/>
takings amounted to no less than &pound;1998, and <lb/>
especially gratifying from the fact that no <lb/>
intoxicating drinks helped to swell the total.</p>
<p>Jack Tar afloat is subject to rigid discipline; he <lb/>
sees the same faces day after day, and no doubt <lb/>
hears the same yarns over and over again, while <lb/>
the opinions of his fellows on any subject of <lb/>
common interest are perfectly well known to him; <lb/>
so when he comes ashore he likes to have a <lb/>
complete change, and this he finds at the Sailors' <lb/>
Rest&mdash;which, with his usual love of nicknaming <lb/>
<pb n="125" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0143"/>
things, he calls the "Three C's," because there <lb/>
he can get Coffee, Comfort, and Company.</p>
<p>Among the many and varied duties of the <lb/>
manager, who is himself an old salt, is the taking <lb/>
charge of the valuables of men who have foolishly <lb/>
spent much of their hard earnings in drink, and <lb/>
thus become incapable of minding their own goods. <lb/>
In exchange for these the sailor receives a ticket, <lb/>
and when he wishes to have the articles returned, <lb/>
he presents this ticket to the manager or one of <lb/>
his assistants.</p>
<p>The Sailors' Rest and Institute, then, is a true <lb/>
home to the men for whom it was established, and <lb/>
by its means many have become disciples of Christ <lb/>
and steadfast members of the Temperance Band, <lb/>
while their officers do not hesitate to say that of all <lb/>
the men in the service none are more reliable or <lb/>
more attentive to duty than those who have come <lb/>
within the sphere of Miss Weston's influence at <lb/>
the "Three C's."</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="V" id="d47">
<head><hi rend="bold">CHAPTER V. <lb/>
Miss Weston's Work at Portsmouth.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> blue-jackets of Devonport had been Miss <lb/>
Weston's care for several years before she <lb/>
saw her way clear to do something for their <lb/>
brethren at Portsmouth. A large number of men <lb/>
work in the Government dockyards there, and <lb/>
ships of all branches of the service are constantly <lb/>
calling; in addition to which, many boys from the <lb/>
training-ship <hi rend="italic">St. Vincent</hi> frequent the town.</p>
<pb n="126" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0144"/>
<p>The need, therefore, of a similar place to that <lb/>
at Devonport was obvious to all, and especially <lb/>
so to the sailors' friend. She knew that a great <lb/>
effort would have to be made to raise money <lb/>
enough to procure a building adequate to the <lb/>
needs of so large a body of men, yet her faith <lb/>
never wavered, and through the kindness and <lb/>
generosity of friends the large sum of &pound;25,000 <lb/>
was eventually got together.</p>
<p>There was some difficulty at first in securing a <lb/>
site, as Miss Weston rightly decided that the <lb/>
Rest should occupy a central position in that <lb/>
quarter of the town best suited to arrest the <lb/>
attention of the passing blue-jacket. At last she <lb/>
succeeded in obtaining a small house, at the back <lb/>
of which was a square-sized hall.</p>
<p>Here she opened a coffee-bar and reading-room, <lb/>
and fitted up a private parlour for the exclusive <lb/>
use of sailors, while certain others were reserved <lb/>
for her own and the manager's use. The hall <lb/>
was, of course, set aside for gospel meetings <lb/>
and temperance work.</p>
<p>The discomforts of this temporary place were not <lb/>
few, but the brave hearts that had begun the good <lb/>
work were not easily daunted; steadily they toiled <lb/>
on, and many a Jack Tar now looks upon the <lb/>
happy meetings in that old hall as the <reg orig="turning-|point">turning-point</reg> <lb/>
in his life.</p>
<p>The very earnest efforts of Miss Weston and <lb/>
her faithful helpers at length attracted the notice <lb/>
of a gentleman who owned some property in the <lb/>
neighbourhood. So interested, indeed, did he <lb/>
become in their work that he one day offered to <lb/>
<pb n="127" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0145"/>
sell them a site, at a very moderate price, whereon <lb/>
to build a Sailors' Rest.</p>
<p>Another good friend allowed a drawing-room <lb/>
meeting to be held in his house, whereby &pound;1000 <lb/>
was raised towards the purchase-money; and, on <lb/>
13 June, 1882, the magnificent building was <lb/>
opened by the blue-jackets in true sailor fashion, <lb/>
the men solemnly pledging themselves to help <lb/>
Miss Weston, and her faithful friend and helper, <lb/>
Miss Wintz, in every possible way.</p>
<p>The interior arrangements here are similar to <lb/>
those of the Devonport Rest: there is a public <lb/>
refreshment bar, much used by people of all <lb/>
classes; reading, recreation, and writing rooms, <lb/>
as well as plentiful accommodation for any sailor <lb/>
who wishes to pass the night at the Institute. Yet <lb/>
the demand for beds is greater than can be met; <lb/>
so shake-downs are frequently made at the earnest <lb/>
request of the men, and it is an understood thing <lb/>
that no sailor, either in full possession of his <lb/>
senses, or bereft of them by drinking, is ever <lb/>
refused shelter at the Institute, if but a corner <lb/>
can be found wherein to give him rest.</p>
<p>The local police are very good to the men they <lb/>
find helplessly rolling about the streets; for, instead <lb/>
of taking them to the police-station, which would <lb/>
be very detrimental to the career of a Jack Tar, <lb/>
they just see them safely into the Sailors' Rest.</p>
<p>Miss Weston's homes are, therefore, real places <lb/>
of refuge, and one wonders how so many years <lb/>
passed without the need of such shelters being <lb/>
recognised. Sailors are shrewd, far-seeing men, <lb/>
as a rule; and if they ever think, as some of them <lb/>
<pb n="128" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0146"/>
must, of the old times, and the condition of their <lb/>
life ashore in naval seaport towns then, they <lb/>
cannot fail to be thankful that the Almighty <lb/>
raised up for them such a large-hearted, devoted <lb/>
friend as Miss Weston, and such a true, loyal, <lb/>
helpful associate as Miss Wintz.</p>
<p>At sea these men have clean sanitary quarters <lb/>
now, but no privacy; so when Jack goes ashore <lb/>
at Devonport or Portsmouth, one of the comforts <lb/>
he most appreciates at the Institute is his <reg orig="snugly-|furnished">snugly-furnished</reg>, <lb/>
spotlessly-clean little cabin "all to <lb/>
himself!"</p>
<p>The boys at Portsmouth have their own suite <lb/>
of rooms, as at Devonport, and the general routine <lb/>
of conduct follows the same lines, while the <lb/>
numbers of boys that throng these rooms give <lb/>
abundant evidence of Miss Weston's influence <lb/>
for good with them.</p>
<p>Some of the cabins have been endowed by <lb/>
private people, while several members of the <lb/>
Royal Family have each presented a cabin to <lb/>
one or other of the Institutes, after having visited <lb/>
and thoroughly examined these homes. Some <lb/>
additions to the original buildings have been <lb/>
made from time to time, but still more room is <lb/>
wanted for dormitories; so it will be necessary <lb/>
to "shake out a reef," as a sailor expressed it to <lb/>
Miss Weston, and this will be done as soon as <lb/>
the funds can be raised.</p>
<p>The Sunday evening meetings at the hall <lb/>
have been most successful from the first, while <lb/>
equally successful gatherings for sailors' wives <lb/>
have been instituted; a well-organised Saturday <lb/>
<pb n="129" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0147"/>
night social fills Jack's heart with delight; while <lb/>
lending libraries, science classes, naval benefit <lb/>
and drapery clubs are open to all who wish to <lb/>
avail themselves of the privilege.</p>

<div2 type="chapter" n="VI" id="d48">
<head><hi rend="bold">CHAPTER VI. <lb/>
Help for Jack's Wife.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Interested</hi> first of all in the spiritual <reg orig="well-|being">wellbeing</reg> <lb/>
of our blue-jackets, Miss Weston's next <lb/>
step, as we have seen, was to care for their <lb/>
moral uplifting and physical comfort, and in <lb/>
the carrying out of these aims her life became <lb/>
gradually absorbed by the navy and its interests, <lb/>
in as far as they affected the men and boys.</p>
<p>Thus we are not surprised to find that when <lb/>
H.M.S. <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italic">Serpent</hi></foreign> went down, Miss Weston was <lb/>
actively associated with the relief committee in <lb/>
caring for the numerous families left totally <reg orig="un-|provided">unprovided</reg> <lb/>
for. The large sum of &pound;13,000 was <lb/>
distributed, and much distress averted, while the <lb/>
sailors' friend discovered still another way in which <lb/>
she might help her beloved Jack Tar.</p>
<p>This was the opening of an employment bureau, <lb/>
by means of which naval pensioners, but more <lb/>
particularly the wives and widows of sailors, are <lb/>
provided with work. This new project was not <lb/>
without its difficulties, for it was found that while <lb/>
the women were quite willing to work, many of <lb/>
them had learnt nothing by which money may be <lb/>
earned.</p>
<pb n="130" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0148"/>
<p>To remedy this was Miss Weston's next <lb/>
thought; and now there are ladies devoting <lb/>
certain portions of each week to teaching these <lb/>
women to sew and make garments, the material <lb/>
for which is provided by the Royal Needlework <lb/>
Guild, of which H.R.H. the Princess of Wales <lb/>
is the president.</p>
<p>The sailor therefore may now leave his wife and <lb/>
family with a much happier heart than in the old <lb/>
days, for he knows that should anything happen <lb/>
to him they will not be in want.</p>
<p>Another matter about which his mind is now easy <lb/>
is the certainty that his wife will be well cared for <lb/>
should she be taken with any illness during his <lb/>
absence, for Miss Weston will at once send a <lb/>
trained nurse to any such case, as soon as it <lb/>
comes within her knowledge.</p>
<p>Then, too, by the assistance of Lady Henry <lb/>
Somerset, she has established several naval <lb/>
branches of the British Women's Temperance <lb/>
Society, so that the wives of service men may be <lb/>
able to join, and thus become helps and not <lb/>
hindrances to their husbands' efforts to lead really <lb/>
good lives.</p>
<p>Bands of Hope have been formed for the <lb/>
children, and those who join Miss Weston's <lb/>
Royal Naval Brigade help her all they can by <lb/>
organising meetings and collecting money.</p>
<p>The loss of H.M.S. <hi rend="italic">Victoria,</hi> in June 1893, was <lb/>
one of the most appalling naval disasters of recent <lb/>
times. Nearly three hundred men and boys sank <lb/>
with her, and many families were bereft of father, <lb/>
brother, or son. Again Miss Weston proved her <lb/>
<pb n="131" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0149"/>
right to be called the sailors' friend. From home <lb/>
to home she travelled, carrying with her comfort <lb/>
for souls and bodies.</p>
<p>She convened meetings of benevolent people <lb/>
and pleaded for the sorrowing, helpless women <lb/>
and children with such earnest, soulful eloquence, <lb/>
that many substantial contributions were willingly <lb/>
sent in. She herself gave &pound;500 to the fund, and <lb/>
undertook to relieve at once all really necessitous <lb/>
cases.</p>
<p>The Portsmouth Sailors' Rest was transformed <lb/>
for the time being into a food distributing centre, <lb/>
and here all monetary aid was given until the <lb/>
slow-moving Patriotic Commissioners felt <reg orig="them-|selves">themselves</reg> <lb/>
able to undertake what was really their <lb/>
duty.</p>
<p>Much practical sympathy reached the mourners <lb/>
through their ever-ready friend, and, in time, <lb/>
&pound;70,000 was at the disposal of the Commissioners <lb/>
for the relief of those who had been dependent <lb/>
upon the brave fellows whose lives were sacrificed <lb/>
through a blunder.</p>
<p>Such strenuous efforts as Miss Weston's could <lb/>
not but attract the attention of all classes, and <lb/>
she received many Royal and private messages <lb/>
thanking her for her great goodness.</p>
<p>After the sad calamity this noble woman <reg orig="deter-|mined">determined</reg> <lb/>
to use all her influence in the formation of <lb/>
a "Widows' Pension Fund," such as exists in <lb/>
several continental countries, or a "National <lb/>
Insurance Fund," so that a man of the Royal <lb/>
Navy, whether blue-jacket or marine, may, by <lb/>
insuring his life, have the comfort of knowing <lb/>
<pb n="132" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0150"/>
that his dependents will have something to fall <lb/>
back upon in the event of his death.</p>
<p>The Royal Navy Union to promote <hi rend="italic">purity of <lb/>
life</hi> is one outcome of Miss Weston's work in the <lb/>
interests of sailors, and has been of untold benefit <lb/>
to those who have joined its ranks; and there <lb/>
are many other smaller organisations which testify <lb/>
to her unwearying labours.</p>
<p>In addition to the two Rests, which, with the <lb/>
permission of our late beloved Queen Victoria, are <lb/>
now called "Royal," she has established a third <lb/>
and smaller Rest at Keyham, Devonport; yet <lb/>
still there is not sufficient accommodation for the <lb/>
men, and money is badly needed to provide room <lb/>
for more cabins.</p>
<p>Though leading such an actively busy life Miss <lb/>
Weston still replies either personally, or through <lb/>
one of her secretaries, to the private letters received <lb/>
from men in all parts of the world. She has <lb/>
also written many bright little books, which <lb/>
are largely circulated and have a most beneficial <lb/>
effect upon those who read them.</p>
<p>The opposition she met with at first has for <lb/>
many years given way to very hearty co-operation <lb/>
by officers of the navy, from the admirals <reg orig="down-|ward">downward</reg>; <lb/>
and, ever since the kitchen meetings at <lb/>
Devonport, she has had a loyal, helpful friend in <lb/>
Miss Wintz, who takes a large share in the <lb/>
management of the Rests, and who also edits, <lb/>
to the entire satisfaction of all who read it, an <lb/>
admirable monthly publication called <hi rend="italic">Ashore and <lb/>
Afloat.</hi></p>
<p>This little pamphlet finds its way all over the <lb/>
<pb n="133" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0151"/>
world, and is regularly taken by the men of the <lb/>
navy of the United States of America.</p>
<p>A full, true, and particular account of the work <lb/>
not only organised and supervised, but actually <lb/>
done by Miss Weston, would fill a large book, <lb/>
but in this brief sketch enough has been said <lb/>
to give the reader a fair idea of what has been <lb/>
accomplished up to the present time.</p>
<p>She has, by God's good grace, still many years <lb/>
before her for the furthering of her beloved work; <lb/>
but, should she not accomplish anything more in <lb/>
this world, it is safe to say that, in the last great <lb/>
Day, many will rise and call her <hi rend="italic">Blessed.</hi></p>

Birth and Inheritance.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Of</hi> the many remarkable women who have lived <lb/>
during recent years, perhaps there is none <lb/>
more remarkable than Angela Georgina, <lb/>
Baroness Burdett-Coutts, daughter of the late <lb/>
Sir Richard Burdett, <lb/>
and grand-daughter <lb/>
of Thomas Coutts, of <lb/>
the well-known <reg orig="bank-|ing">banking</reg> <lb/>
firm. She seems <lb/>
to have been the <lb/>
special favourite of <lb/>
her grandfather's <lb/>
second wife, for that <lb/>
lady, who afterwards <lb/>
became Duchess of <lb/>
St. Alban's, left the <lb/>
whole of the enormous fortune bequeathed to her <lb/>
by Thomas Coutts to Angela Burdett.</p>
<figure id="f10" rend="inline" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0152"/>
<p>Thus, when little more than twenty, that young <lb/>
lady became a millionaire; and, from gratitude <lb/>
to her benefactress, she at once sought and <lb/>
obtained legal permission to use the name of <lb/>
Coutts in addition to her own, and for many years <lb/>
was known to the world as Miss Burdett-Coutts.</p>
<p>She was born on 21st April, 1814, and, throughout <lb/>
<pb n="135" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0153"/>
her long and eminently useful life, has <reg orig="endeav-|oured">endeavoured</reg> <lb/>
to use her vast wealth for the benefit of her <lb/>
fellow-creatures not so happily placed.</p>
<p>Her father had been Member of Parliament for <lb/>
Westminster for thirty years, and, in memory of <lb/>
him, she built and endowed a church in <reg orig="West-|minster">Westminster</reg>, <lb/>
dedicated to St. Stephen, as well as a <lb/>
good residence for the Vicar, schools, <reg orig="mission-|rooms">mission-rooms</reg>, <lb/>
and Technical Institute adjoining, the <lb/>
total cost amounting to &pound;90,000.</p>
<p>The story of her father's death is a very sad one. <lb/>
He was most deeply attached to his wife, and, on <lb/>
her death, his grief was so great that three days <lb/>
later he too died, and was buried with her, in <lb/>
a vault of Ramsbury Church, Wiltshire.</p>
<p>When it was found necessary to restore this <lb/>
church, Miss Burdett-Coutts contributed largely <lb/>
to the cost, as she also did when Baydon Church, <lb/>
near by, was renovated. As a further memorial, <lb/>
she built a number of comfortable cottages for the <lb/>
labouring people of the parish of Baydon.</p>
<p>In the town of Carlisle there stands a handsome <lb/>
church, whose patron saint, like the one at <reg orig="West-|minster">Westminster</reg>, <lb/>
is St. Stephen, and this, with the adjoining <lb/>
schools, was the gift of Miss Burdett-Coutts.</p>
<p>Her interest in the Church of England, however, <lb/>
has not been confined to our own country; for we <lb/>
know that she gave the noble sum of &pound;50,000 <lb/>
to provide means for the support of Colonial <lb/>
Bishoprics at Adelaide, Cape Town, and British <lb/>
Columbia, and thus assured to the churches in <lb/>
those far-off lands a certain if not a large income <lb/>
wherewith to meet necessary expenses.</p>
<pb n="136" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0154"/>
<p>Not only to churches, however, has this good <lb/>
woman given so generously; for numerous schools <lb/>
throughout the country are now in a state of <lb/>
prosperity owing to her liberal assistance, while <lb/>
the site upon which stands St. Anne's School, <lb/>
Highgate, was given by her, and the cost of <lb/>
building St. Peter's School, Stepney, was largely <lb/>
met by a donation from the same lady.</p>
<p>Her interest in schools, no doubt, led her to take <lb/>
an active share in the training of the students <lb/>
attending the Whitelands Training College for <lb/>
Teachers, London. Miss Burdett-Coutts believed <lb/>
in teaching girls not only to become good scholars, <lb/>
but good housewives; not only to love their <reg orig="fellow-|beings">fellow-beings</reg>, <lb/>
but to be kind to every living thing; not <lb/>
only to appreciate the useful, but also the beautiful <lb/>
things of the earth; and, further, while having <lb/>
a kindly feeling for all nations, to esteem their <lb/>
native land the best.</p>
<p>All these views she set before the students at <lb/>
Whitelands in such a manner as to convince them <lb/>
of the truth of her theories, and there is no doubt <lb/>
that many of these young people started out upon <lb/>
their important duties in life all the better able <lb/>
to fulfil them for the good counsel so earnestly <lb/>
given by this broad-minded philanthropist.</p>
<p>The question of ways and means in regard to <lb/>
schools has ever been of interest to Miss <reg orig="Burdett-|Coutts">Burdett-Coutts</reg>, <lb/>
and so we are not surprised to find that <lb/>
she exerted herself to obtain Government <reg orig="exam-|ination">examination</reg> <lb/>
for all rural schools, so that the grant of <lb/>
money thus earned should relieve them of being <lb/>
quite dependent on voluntary contributions.</p>
<pb n="137" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0155"/>
<p>In this way many of the most remote schools <lb/>
were lifted from poverty to independence, and <lb/>
numbers of children resident in these isolated <lb/>
places have been enabled to receive at least a <lb/>
fair education.</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="II" id="d51">
<head><hi rend="bold">CHAPTER II. <lb/>
Helping the Weak and Helpless.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">It</hi> is impossible for anyone to live in a large <lb/>
town and remain blind to the great amount <lb/>
of unnecessary suffering endured by many of <lb/>
the children of the lowest classes.</p>
<p>Unnatural as it seems to right-minded people, <lb/>
it is nevertheless a fact that the parents of many <lb/>
of these poor little waifs are their worst enemies.</p>
<p>Living, as she did, in the largest city in the <lb/>
world, and moving so much among children <reg orig="at-|tending">attending</reg> <lb/>
the primary schools, Miss Burdett-Coutts's <lb/>
heart was filled with pity for the ill-used little <lb/>
mites; so she determined to try to make their lot <lb/>
somewhat brighter. She knew well that the vile <lb/>
people who neglect and ill-treat their own children <lb/>
must be downright selfish cowards, and so she <lb/>
sought to make them kinder to, and more careful <lb/>
of, their little ones, from fear of punishment to <lb/>
themselves.</p>
<p>The result of her efforts was the founding of <lb/>
the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty <lb/>
to Children. This society has now a branch in <lb/>
every town in our kingdom, with inspectors whose <lb/>
work consists in discovering for themselves cases <lb/>
<pb n="138" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0156"/>
of cruelty to, or neglect of, children; of probing <lb/>
the truth of statements made to them; and of <lb/>
bringing the parents or responsible persons before <lb/>
the magistrates to answer for their conduct.</p>
<p>If they are found guilty, adequate punishment, <lb/>
either by imprisonment or by fine, is meted out to <lb/>
them, and the consequence is that the conditions <lb/>
under which many of these poor children now <lb/>
live are certainly better than before Miss <reg orig="Burdett-|Coutts's">Burdett-Coutts's</reg> <lb/>
kindly interference.</p>
<p>Nor did her care of the children end here, for <lb/>
when a number of good people united in <reg orig="pro-|viding">providing</reg> <lb/>
dinners for the children of the destitute <lb/>
poor, she willingly accepted the important <reg orig="posi-|tion">position</reg> <lb/>
of president, and now many of the boys and <lb/>
girls attending the poorer schools of London <lb/>
get at least one good meal a day.</p>
<p>It was indeed pitiful to see the white-faced, <lb/>
shivering waifs trying to learn lessons, without <lb/>
having tasted a bit of food that day&mdash;which <lb/>
was, and is, actually the case with many of the <lb/>
scholars attending the schools in the poorest <lb/>
parts of London.</p>
<p>Of course the winter is their worst time; but, <lb/>
thanks to the many kind-hearted ladies and <reg orig="gentle-|men">gentlemen</reg> <lb/>
who give both time and money to the work, <lb/>
much of this child misery is being remedied.</p>
<p>One cannot begin work of this kind without <lb/>
being brought into contact with other evils quite <lb/>
as appalling; and so it was that, in seeking to <lb/>
benefit the little ones, Miss Burdett-Coutts <reg orig="dis-|covered">discovered</reg> <lb/>
such awful wretchedness and destitution <lb/>
among the dwellers in the slums and courts of <lb/>
<pb n="139" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0157"/>
the city that she felt compelled to do something <lb/>
to alleviate it.</p>
<p>Now it has never been part of her plan to <lb/>
make paupers or beggars of even the most <reg orig="dis-|tressed">distressed</reg>; <lb/>
so she was careful to give to them in <lb/>
such a way that they may be able to earn money <lb/>
for themselves afterwards.</p>
<p>Thus we find that she organised a Shoe-black <lb/>
Brigade, which enabled boys of certain ages to <lb/>
earn a decent and honest living. By this means <lb/>
numbers of lads were rescued from vicious idleness <lb/>
and helped to become respectable men; indeed, <lb/>
some of our smartest soldiers and sailors have <lb/>
been drawn from this very brigade.</p>
<p>For the girls who earn their living by selling <lb/>
flowers in the streets she established a Flower <lb/>
Girls' Brigade, the members of which are not <lb/>
only protected when carrying on their trade, but <lb/>
are also taught the art of artificial-flower making.</p>
<p>The women, too&mdash;those poor misguided creatures <lb/>
usually considered beyond all human hope&mdash;were <lb/>
her next care. To her they were still God's <lb/>
creatures, and, as such, to be tended with even <lb/>
greater tenderness than others who had been born <lb/>
to better things.</p>
<p>She made a Home for them at Shepherd's Bush, <lb/>
where they were kindly but firmly treated, taught <lb/>
the different branches of household management, <lb/>
and afterward, should they so choose, sent to the <lb/>
colonies, where many of them became in time <lb/>
respected and prosperous.</p>
<p>Then this noble woman determined to do <lb/>
something for the poor women whose chief faults <lb/>
<pb n="140" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0158"/>
were incompetence and idleness. These she <lb/>
gathered into a sewing school at Brown's Lane, <lb/>
Spitalfields, fed them, taught them, gave them <lb/>
work; and so successful was the effort that many <lb/>
Government contracts were carried out to the <lb/>
satisfaction of all.</p>
<p>If a poor woman is sick, a kindly and <reg orig="com-|petent">competent</reg> <lb/>
nurse is sent to attend her; should a case <lb/>
of deserving poverty come to the knowledge of <lb/>
the Committee of Management, clothing is at <lb/>
once provided; while any girl desirous of entering <lb/>
domestic service may, by applying here, obtain the <lb/>
necessary outfit.</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="III" id="d52">
<head><hi rend="bold">CHAPTER III. <lb/>
Work in the London Slums.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> winter of 1861 was a very severe one. The <lb/>
earth was frost-bound for a long time, and <lb/>
many men were consequently thrown out of <lb/>
employment. Such was the case with the tanners <lb/>
of Bermondsey, who, however, found a ready and <lb/>
generous helper in Miss Burdett-Coutts, as did also <lb/>
the weavers of East London. Through her <reg orig="kind-|ness">kindness</reg> <lb/>
and benevolence a society was formed for <lb/>
their aid, and many were provided with the means <lb/>
to start life afresh in a new country.</p>
<p>Thus we see that in Miss Burdett-Coutts the <lb/>
poor of London had a true friend; one who tried <lb/>
to lift them out of a state of almost hopeless <reg orig="help-|lessness">helplessness</reg> <lb/>
into one of independent self-help; one <lb/>
who, while not giving indiscriminate alms, never <lb/>
<pb n="141" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0159"/>
once neglected to assist the really helpless, or <lb/>
allowed a man the misery of seeing his family in <lb/>
distress because he, for a time, was unable to bring <lb/>
in the usual wage.</p>
<p>The next thing to occupy the attention of this <lb/>
warm-hearted woman was the state of the houses <lb/>
in which these poor people lived. It was no <lb/>
uncommon thing to find seven or eight persons <lb/>
occupying one room, and each room in the house <lb/>
would be equally crowded. Even the cellars&mdash; <lb/>
where cellars existed&mdash;were let at rents which <lb/>
would have been dear for good airy rooms.</p>
<p>If the rents were paid promptly, the wretched <lb/>
tenants were allowed to herd together as they <lb/>
pleased; no effort was made to repair any portion <lb/>
of the buildings, while all decent sanitary <reg orig="arrange-|ments">arrangements</reg> <lb/>
were conspicuous by their absence. And <lb/>
the worst feature of the whole business was, and <lb/>
still is, that those people who deplored their <reg orig="sur-|roundings">surroundings</reg> <lb/>
were compelled to occupy rooms in <lb/>
such localities because their means would not allow <lb/>
them to live amid more pleasant surroundings.</p>
<p>With her usual grasp of difficulties, Miss <lb/>
Burdett-Coutts realised that in many cases slums <lb/>
are caused by the property owners and not by <lb/>
the people who inhabit them; so she at once set <lb/>
to work to remedy the evil.</p>
<p>In a part of the metropolis known as Nova <lb/>
Scotia Gardens she erected a block a model <lb/>
buildings, constructed on the flat system. Each <lb/>
set of rooms, having its own front door, is quite <lb/>
shut off from the rest of the building, and the <lb/>
people who occupy it are as much separated from <lb/>
<pb n="142" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0160"/>
their neighbours as if they lived beneath another <lb/>
roof.</p>
<p>Every modern convenience necessary to health <lb/>
and comfort is provided; so the tenants can have <lb/>
the luxury of a bath, and the convenience of a <lb/>
well-fitted laundry, while, when their work is <lb/>
done, they have the advantage of a comfortable <lb/>
reading-room and a well-stocked library.</p>
<p>It may be thought that the rent for all this <lb/>
must be high. Not so; these ideal dwellings <lb/>
are within the means of the respectable poor, <lb/>
which was the intention of the generous founder. <lb/>
About two hundred families occupy them, <reg orig="averag-|ing">averaging</reg> <lb/>
five in a family, and the tenements are now <lb/>
known as Columbia Square.</p>
<p>Some time later it occurred to Miss Burdett-Coutts <lb/>
that she could still further help these people by <lb/>
providing them with a market where they could <lb/>
buy wholesome food at a reasonable price. The <lb/>
market was built, and is said to be the finest in the <lb/>
world so far as the building itself is concerned; but <lb/>
unfortunately, it has never been successful. It is <lb/>
called Columbia Market, and is quite close to the <lb/>
model buildings.</p>
<p>In the year 1881 this noble woman became the <lb/>
wife of an American gentleman named William <lb/>
Leham Ashmead-Bartlett, who has now taken over <lb/>
the management of the Columbia Market, and hopes <lb/>
to make it the success his wife intended it to be.</p>
<p>A large fleet of fishing-boats is engaged in <lb/>
supplying the market with fish from the North <lb/>
Sea, and these are sold to the poor at a very cheap <lb/>
rate. It is to be hoped that the generous donor <lb/>
<pb n="143" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0161"/>
and her husband will one day be repaid for the <lb/>
care and attention bestowed on it, by the market <lb/>
becoming a flourishing centre of trade.</p>
<p>It would be almost impossible to tell the number <lb/>
of ways in which Miss Burdett-Coutts has sought <lb/>
to make good use of the enormous fortune which is <lb/>
hers to command, but it is certain that the London <lb/>
poor alone have had a goodly share of it.</p>
<p>She has been mindful of neither money nor time <lb/>
nor personal effort to benefit them; and even now, <lb/>
when advanced age should claim a time of rest, <lb/>
she throws open the grounds of her lovely London <lb/>
home, Holly Lodge, every summer, so that the <lb/>
children for whom she has always had a loving <lb/>
thought may enjoy at least one happy holiday.</p>

<head><hi rend="bold">CHAPTER IV. <lb/>
Help to the Distressed Irish.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Although</hi> so engrossed with the troubles <lb/>
of the London poor, this large-hearted <lb/>
woman yet spared much time to think out <lb/>
plans for helping the destitute Irish.</p>
<p>In dealing with the subject of over population and <lb/>
its consequent evils, she has ever advised <reg orig="emigra-|tion">emigration</reg> <lb/>
as one way out of the difficulty, and, when in <lb/>
1862 the misery of the poor in the south and west <lb/>
of Ireland was made known to her, she at once <lb/>
offered to aid any who cared to try making a living <lb/>
in Canada or Australia; and many gladly availed <lb/>
themselves of her kindness.</p>
<pb n="144" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0162"/>
<p>The following year the distress was even greater <lb/>
in these districts, owing to the failure of the crops. <lb/>
Again Miss Burdett-Coutts went to the aid of the <lb/>
people. She established stores where they could <lb/>
buy every necessary at cheap prices, and sent a <lb/>
good supply of warm blankets to be lent to <reg orig="any-|one">anyone</reg> <lb/>
who needed them.</p>
<p>She did more: she actually proposed a plan to <lb/>
the Government for the supply of seeds to the <lb/>
distressed farmers, the cost of which was to be <lb/>
repaid by them in some convenient manner; and <lb/>
she further offered to lend the large sum of <lb/>
&pound;250,000, with which to carry out the proposal!</p>
<p>The natives of this district, however, were not <lb/>
the only Irish people to benefit by her generosity <lb/>
and kindly interest, for, in the year 1880, she <lb/>
decided to give an impetus to the fishing trade of <lb/>
Baltimore by enabling the fishermen to buy large <lb/>
and suitable boats with which to ply their trade. <lb/>
To this end she placed &pound;10,000 at the disposal of <lb/>
a Roman Catholic priest, upon whose discretion <lb/>
she felt she could rely. In order to satisfy herself <lb/>
as to the real cause of the great distress among <lb/>
these fisher folk, Miss Burdett-Coutts visited <lb/>
Baltimore, with the result that some time later <lb/>
a training-school for fisher lads was founded there.</p>
<p>This institution is known as "The Baltimore <lb/>
Industrial Fishery School," and was opened in <lb/>
1887 by this lady, who might well be called the <lb/>
fishermen's friend.</p>
<p>Again she had set herself a difficult task to <lb/>
accomplish, and again she had brought it to a <lb/>
successful conclusion, and it is indeed pleasing <lb/>
<pb n="145" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0163"/>
to think that of the thousands who received her <lb/>
aid not one had lost his self-respect by being the <lb/>
recipient of alms!</p>
<p>Yet the thoughts of this noble woman were not <lb/>
wholly with the poor of the working-classes. She <lb/>
knew that bad times for the farmer meant bad <lb/>
times for the landlord; indeed, she suggested at <lb/>
one time a loan to the farmers with which they <lb/>
might pay their debts, the money to be repaid <lb/>
in such a way as not to harass them; but, while <lb/>
all this was being talked over, the fact remained <lb/>
patent to them all that numbers of Irish ladies <lb/>
who were land-owners and almost entirely <lb/>
dependent on their rents, were in urgent need of <lb/>
help. A fund was started for their relief, and to <lb/>
this our generous philanthropist gave largely.</p>
<p>The name of Angela Burdett-Coutts had now <lb/>
become a household word, and high and low <lb/>
sought to do her reverence. The late Queen <lb/>
Victoria made her a Baroness in her own right, <lb/>
in the year 1871; she was presented with the <lb/>
freedom of the City of London in 1872, together <lb/>
with a handsome testimonial; and two years later <lb/>
she became a freeman of the Scottish capital, in <lb/>
recognition, among other charitable works, of her <lb/>
benefits to the starving folk of Girvan. Since <lb/>
being raised to the peerage she has been known <lb/>
as the Baroness or Lady Burdett-Coutts, and as <lb/>
such she has continued the deeds of loving-kindness <lb/>
which had become part and parcel of her life.</p>
<p>And now a new sphere of usefulness opened out <lb/>
before her. There had been war between Russia <lb/>
and Turkey, and, of course, the usual amount of <lb/>
<pb n="146" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0164"/>
suffering was expected. The folk who dwell in <lb/>
and around the scene of battle endure ruin and <lb/>
misery at all times, but in this particular war <lb/>
the Moslem women and children were treated <lb/>
atrociously by the Russian soldiers, and at last a <lb/>
great cry against their brutality arose throughout <lb/>
the world.</p>
<p>Protests were sent to the Russian authorities, <lb/>
and much practical help and sympathy reached <lb/>
the sufferers. It is needless to say that one <lb/>
of the first to realise the dreadful position of <lb/>
the poor creatures was the Baroness <reg orig="Burdett-|Coutts">Burdett-Coutts</reg>. <lb/>
In response to her appeals for help, the <lb/>
Turkish Compassionate Fund was raised, and in <lb/>
due time reached the large total of &pound;43,000, of <lb/>
which she gave no less than &pound;1000.</p>
<p>It was proposed to send food, clothing, and <lb/>
medicine to the sufferers, and the kind-hearted <lb/>
gentleman who undertook to see that the goods <lb/>
were wisely distributed was he who afterwards <lb/>
became the husband of Lady Burdett-Coutts.</p>
<p>As a token of the esteem in which he held the <lb/>
woman who had so nobly come forward to the <lb/>
relief of his suffering people, the Sultan of Turkey <lb/>
bestowed on her the Order of Medjidie, an honour <lb/>
never before held by a woman.</p>

The Friend of Dumb Creatures.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> story of the Zulu War of 1879 is now a <lb/>
matter of history, and all of us will be able <lb/>
to understand the sufferings and privations <lb/>
of our gallant soldiers the better from our <reg orig="experi-|ence">experience</reg> <lb/>
during the recent South African campaign.</p>
<p>A committee of ladies was formed, with the <lb/>
Baroness Burdett-Coutts as president; and seven <lb/>
trained nurses, with the necessary medical stores <lb/>
and clothing, were sent out, at great cost, to the <lb/>
seat of war.</p>
<p>Many thousands of the poor maimed fellows, <lb/>
both British and Zulu, were brought back from <lb/>
the gates of death by these clever women, while <lb/>
their kindly care and words of comfort soothed <lb/>
the last hours of many a man, as he passed <lb/>
away to the land where there is no more <lb/>
suffering.</p>
<p>And now, having formed a good idea of the <lb/>
value set upon human life by this good woman, <lb/>
we shall not be surprised to know that she regards <lb/>
the life of dumb beasts just as highly. It has <lb/>
ever been her endeavour to save them, not only <lb/>
from unnecessary pain, but also from discomfort.</p>
<p>To the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty <lb/>
to Animals she gives her hearty support; and, in <lb/>
order to encourage the London costers to treat <lb/>
their donkeys well, she built a set of airy, sanitary <lb/>
stables for them, near to Columbia Square.</p>
<pb n="148" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0166"/>
<p>Horses are great favourites of hers, and more <lb/>
especially those used for drawing heavy loads. <lb/>
For many years she has subscribed liberally to <lb/>
the Cart-Horse Parade Society, and in the year <lb/>
1882 she travelled to Newcastle on purpose to <lb/>
see the annual parade there.</p>
<p>It was a sight worth seeing, for not only did <lb/>
big glossy-coated draught-horses march by with <lb/>
stately tread, but well-groomed donkeys and <lb/>
sleek little coal-pit ponies trotted past, apparently <lb/>
conscious of the fact that they were as worthy <lb/>
of a share in the show as their weightier <lb/>
brethren.</p>
<p>The grand display of animals, however, was not <lb/>
the chief attraction to the people of Newcastle <lb/>
and its environs, for it is said that a hundred <lb/>
thousand persons thronged into the town on <lb/>
purpose to see the good lady of whom they had <lb/>
heard so much.</p>
<p>While on a visit to Edinburgh, Lady <reg orig="Burdett-|Coutts">Burdett-Coutts</reg> <lb/>
was told a story of a faithful little dog <lb/>
which pleased her very much. It seems that a <lb/>
small terrier was so attached to its master, that <lb/>
after his death the little creature went every day, <lb/>
for fourteen years, to watch beside his grave in <lb/>
the Greyfriars Cemetery. So well known did he <lb/>
become that the people called him "Greyfriars <lb/>
Bobby," and great was their grief when the <lb/>
faithful animal was himself laid to rest. The <lb/>
Baroness was so touched by its fidelity that she <lb/>
erected a fountain to its memory close to the gate <lb/>
of the cemetery.</p>
<p>The British Goat Society was promoted to <lb/>
<pb entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0167"/>
<figure id="f11" rend="page" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0167">
<head>"It was a sight worth seeing."</head>
</figure>
<pb entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0168"/>
<pb n="149" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0169"/>
encourage the keeping of these animals as a means <lb/>
of profit to the cottagers in rural districts. They <lb/>
are very hardy, and yield a good nourishing milk; <lb/>
while they need but little attention. A similar <lb/>
society also exists for the promotion of bee culture; <lb/>
and as Lady Burdett-Coutts quite agrees with the <lb/>
founders of these societies, she was very pleased <lb/>
to accept the presidency of each.</p>
<p>She keeps quite a number of goats, as well as <lb/>
cows and Ilamas, on her London property, and <lb/>
finds them all that they have been represented. <lb/>
By setting the example of practising what she <lb/>
preaches she hopes to induce the peasants to try the <lb/>
experiment, and, should they do so, there is no <lb/>
doubt that their efforts will be amply repaid.</p>
<p>For many years now there has been a great <lb/>
outcry against the use of birds as ornaments for <lb/>
ladies' hats, and also against catching and <reg orig="im-|prisoning">imprisoning</reg> <lb/>
song-birds. Both these practices are <lb/>
productive of much suffering to the little creatures, <lb/>
and a society has been formed by some <reg orig="kind-|hearted">kind-hearted</reg> <lb/>
ladies to endeavour to put a stop to <lb/>
them; of this society, too, the Baroness became <lb/>
president.</p>
<p>Then she called public attention to the intensely <lb/>
cruel way in which cattle were transported from <lb/>
place to place, either by railway-train or by boat. <lb/>
All her influence was brought to bear upon the <lb/>
companies to induce them to provide better <reg orig="ac-|commodation">accommodation</reg> <lb/>
for the poor animals, so that they <lb/>
might be able to rest, and to eat and drink with <lb/>
at least some degree of comfort.</p>
<p>Indeed, there is no form of suffering borne by <lb/>
<pb n="150" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0170"/>
man or beast that does not appeal strongly to <lb/>
this great-hearted woman, and her immense wealth <lb/>
has enabled her to be a tower of strength to every <lb/>
society to which she has lent her name.</p>
<p>One thing is noticeable in all her actions, and <lb/>
that is her perfect readiness to aid any one in <lb/>
distress without regard to either his religious <lb/>
belief or his nationality. His trouble may be <lb/>
purely the accident of a moment or the result of <lb/>
sheer lack of personal effort; he may be Jew or <lb/>
Gentile, bond or free; his sin may be one of <lb/>
omission or commission: these matters do not <lb/>
weigh with her&mdash;if he is willing to begin again <lb/>
she will help him to do so, but none need apply <lb/>
to her who think to obtain unquestioned and <lb/>
unlimited charity.</p>
<p>Her goodness, her loving-kindness, her ready <lb/>
sympathy and her sound common-sense have <lb/>
rendered her enormous fortune of almost national <lb/>
benefit, and beyond all doubt her character had <lb/>
been rightly gauged by the lady who left the <lb/>
management and responsibility of so vast a sum <lb/>
as &pound;2,000,000 to Angela Burdett.</p>
<p>Her days have been long in the land; the good <lb/>
she has accomplished is beyond knowledge; she <lb/>
holds a position, among the women of Britain, <lb/>
peculiarly her own, and in the distant ages few <lb/>
daughters of our mighty Empire will have a <lb/>
grander record on the scroll of fame than Angela <lb/>
Georgina, Baroness Burdett-Coutts.</p>

<div2 type="chapter" n="I" id="d56">
<head><hi rend="bold">CHAPTER I. <lb/>
Early Training.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Rather</hi> less than half a century ago, Great <lb/>
Britain rang with the praises of one of her <lb/>
many daughters. Her name was familiar as <lb/>
a household word. Poets sang of her, statesmen <lb/>
of all nations sought <lb/>
her advice, kings and <lb/>
queens paid tribute to <lb/>
her. Yet for none <lb/>
of these things did <lb/>
this noble woman <lb/>
leave home and <lb/>
kindred, and all that <lb/>
makes life dear, to <lb/>
fare forth among <lb/>
strangers, to sojourn <lb/>
for a while in a bleak <lb/>
and snow-bound land, rendered still more desolate <lb/>
by the ravages of cruel war. Let us see what <lb/>
kind of woman this was, who could so venture <lb/>
into scenes of horror and misery in the face of that <lb/>
public opinion which bounded woman's sphere of <lb/>
usefulness by the four walls of her own home.</p>
<figure id="f12" rend="inline" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0171"/>
<p>Born in the Italian town from which she takes <lb/>
her name, May, 1820, Florence Nightingale was <lb/>
the youngest daughter of William Nightingale, <lb/>
of Lea Hurst, Matlock Bath, Derbyshire. Her <lb/>
father gave a great deal of time and thought to <lb/>
<pb n="152" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0172"/>
her education, so that she became a finished <lb/>
classical scholar, an able mathematician, and a <lb/>
polished linguist.</p>
<p>A brilliant career lay before her, but, like Mary <lb/>
of old, she chose the better part. During the <lb/>
whole of her young life, pain and suffering had <lb/>
ever strongly appealed to her. Living as she <lb/>
did close to mines and quarries, Florence <reg orig="Night-|ingale">Nightingale</reg> <lb/>
early had experience of the dreadful <lb/>
accidents to which the workers in these places <lb/>
are ever liable. Her tender young heart bled for <lb/>
their sufferings, and never was she more happy <lb/>
than when helping to render them more bearable. <lb/>
The poor injured fellows forgot their pain when <lb/>
she appeared, and the faith they had in her is <lb/>
well shown by the speech of one of them. "Our <lb/>
young miss is better than nurse or doctor!" said <lb/>
he, and he was not far wrong.</p>
<p>Her longing to relieve pain decided her career, <lb/>
and she left home with the intention of devoting <lb/>
herself wholly to the sick and distressed. To <lb/>
those who knew her this decision was a surprise, <lb/>
for Florence was painfully shy, and such a life <lb/>
as that of a nurse allows no room for shyness. <lb/>
Miss Nightingale, however, had the strength of <lb/>
mind to follow rather than yield to her natural <lb/>
weakness; yet she herself says, "Being naturally <lb/>
a very shy person, the whole of my life has been <lb/>
distasteful to me."</p>
<p>What an instance of self-restraint is this! How <lb/>
many of us compel ourselves to do things from <lb/>
which we shrink by nature, merely that others <lb/>
may benefit? If we really want to be helpful, <lb/>
<pb n="153" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0173"/>
however, we must forget our own likes and dislikes, <lb/>
and then we shall, like the noble woman before us, <lb/>
become more than conquerors.</p>
<p>Florence Nightingale was thorough in all things. <lb/>
If she decided to do a thing, she did it as well as <lb/>
she possibly could. She hated half-measures and <lb/>
excuses in her younger days, and it is certain that, <lb/>
even now, those who would please her must put <lb/>
their whole heart and energy into all that they <lb/>
undertake. This is her advice to young girls: <lb/>
"If you are called to any particular vocation, <lb/>
qualify yourselves for it as a man does for his <lb/>
work. Don't undertake it otherwise."</p>
<p>Then, too, she abhors the woman who, while <lb/>
clinging to all her own weaknesses, wishes to pose <lb/>
as the equal of man. To such she says: "If you <lb/>
are called to man's work, do not exact a woman's <lb/>
privilege&mdash;inaccuracy, weakness; submit <reg orig="your-|selves">yourselves</reg> <lb/>
to the rules of business, as men do, by <lb/>
which alone God's business can succeed. There <lb/>
is no blessing on sketchy work. Be business-like, <lb/>
orderly, thorough."</p>
<p>Holding such opinions as these, and having, <lb/>
in addition, great sympathy, large-heartedness, <lb/>
and unusual natural ability, Florence Nightingale <lb/>
became one of the grandest specimens of <reg orig="woman-|hood">womanhood</reg> <lb/>
the world has ever seen.</p>
<p>Acting upon the advice she gave later to others, <lb/>
this gently-nurtured, sensitive, refined girl became <lb/>
a student of hospital management, sick-nursing, <lb/>
and surgical remedies in various institutions both <lb/>
at home and abroad. For some years she studied <lb/>
with the Sisters of Charity in Paris, and also with <lb/>
<pb n="154" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0174"/>
the Protestant Sisters of Mercy at Kaiserwerth, <lb/>
on the Rhine.</p>
<p>Having obtained a thorough knowledge of the <lb/>
many branches of her profession, she returned to <lb/>
London, where she devoted some time to the <lb/>
restoration and re-establishment of the Sanatorium <lb/>
for Governesses, in Harley Street.</p>
<p>Being one of a wealthy family, Miss Nightingale <lb/>
had plenty of money at her command, and this she <lb/>
spent freely in carrying out the task she had set <lb/>
herself. The knowledge of sanitation and hygiene <lb/>
she had acquired, together with her sound and <lb/>
practical common-sense, enabled her to re-establish <lb/>
the institution on a thoroughly healthy basis, while <lb/>
her natural gift of organisation was shown in the <lb/>
splendid system of management she introduced.</p>

<head><hi rend="bold">CHAPTER II. <lb/>
Work in the Crimea.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">At</hi> this time Great Britain and France were <lb/>
at war with Russia: the scene of battle <lb/>
being the Crimean Peninsula. Hostilities <lb/>
commenced in March 1854, and during the <lb/>
following autumn heart-rending stories reached <lb/>
England of the sufferings and privations of <lb/>
the soldiers.</p>
<p>Stores of medicines, bandages, surgical <reg orig="appli-|ances">appliances</reg>, <lb/>
everything, in fact, necessary in the military <lb/>
hospitals, either failed to reach the base altogether, <lb/>
or were so long delayed on the journey that <lb/>
<pb n="155" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0175"/>
thousands of our brave men perished for very <lb/>
lack of them.</p>
<p>The hospitals were so densely packed and <lb/>
grossly mismanaged that large numbers died who <lb/>
had never received a wound. Even the things <lb/>
necessary to keep the fighting-line in fit condition <lb/>
for their strenuous work were conspicuous by their <lb/>
absence; so the poor fellows had to fight on, in <lb/>
the biting cold, half-starved, half-clothed, <reg orig="bare-|footed">barefooted</reg>, <lb/>
until the tale of their woes roused such <lb/>
indignation at home that those in authority were <lb/>
fain to seek some capable, level-headed woman <lb/>
who would at least undertake to alleviate in some <lb/>
measure the sufferings of the most helpless&mdash;the <lb/>
sick and wounded.</p>
<p>During the short time Florence Nightingale had <lb/>
been, as it were, before the public, she had made <lb/>
for herself a name; and thus it was that, in his <lb/>
extremity, the Secretary for War, Mr. Sidney <lb/>
&lpar;afterwards Lord&rpar; Herbert, begged her to take a <lb/>
band of trained nurses to the Crimea, and do what <lb/>
she could to set matters on a better footing.</p>
<p>Here, then, was her chance. For ten long years <lb/>
she had been fitting herself for such a mission, <lb/>
and when it came she at once accepted it.</p>
<p>Many devoted women responded to their <lb/>
country's call, but Florence Nightingale knew <lb/>
full well that much more than willing hands and <lb/>
tender hearts was needed for the work before <lb/>
them; so, with rigid adherence to her principles, <lb/>
she selected only such as were, by training and <lb/>
nature, well qualified to stand the strain that <lb/>
would of necessity be put upon them.</p>
<pb n="156" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0176"/>
<p>On 21st October 1854, she started for the front <lb/>
with ninety-two competent nurses, many of whom <lb/>
were of Britain's noblest. The journey was in <lb/>
no way remarkable, and on arriving at Scutari, <lb/>
4th November, Miss Nightingale and her nurses <lb/>
immediately set to work and soon reduced the <lb/>
existing confusion to some appearance of order.</p>
<p>None too soon, however, was this done, for on <lb/>
the very next day was fought the famous battle of <lb/>
Inkermann, bringing in its train intense suffering <lb/>
to six hundred of our men, sorrow to friends at <lb/>
home, yet, withal, glory to the allied forces of <lb/>
Britain and France!</p>
<p>The number of sick, over and above the <lb/>
wounded, in the hospital at Scutari alone, was <lb/>
appalling, but this only nerved the brave woman <lb/>
to greater feats of endurance and increased power <lb/>
of general management. In order to provide <lb/>
proper accommodation for the ten thousand men <lb/>
that were soon under her care, she arranged the <lb/>
beds in rows, which, when measured, reached the <lb/>
grand total of two and a third miles! And this <lb/>
when the space between the beds was barely three <lb/>
feet!</p>
<p>Having set this hospital in good working order, <lb/>
she next turned her attention to others on and <lb/>
around the Bosphorus, all of which had now been <lb/>
placed in her hands. It was a great undertaking, <lb/>
but she accomplished it.</p>
<p>It must not be thought, however, that Miss <lb/>
Nightingale was allowed to work uninterruptedly. <lb/>
Many and grievous hindrances were placed in <lb/>
her way, and this by those who should have <lb/>
<pb entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0177"/>

<figure id="f13" rend="page" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0178">
<head>"We could kiss her shadow as it fell."</head>
</figure>
<pb n="157" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0179"/>
given her every assistance; but calmly, devotedly, <lb/>
the slight, delicate woman pursued the plan she <lb/>
had mapped out for herself, until her absolute <lb/>
self-devotion and infinite kindness of heart won <lb/>
for her the love of every man brought within the <lb/>
sphere of her influence.</p>
<p>The intense humanity which looked forth <lb/>
from her eyes as she gazed in pity upon her <lb/>
suffering charges, and the tender sympathy <lb/>
of her loving touch upon each fevered brow, <lb/>
made the poor, pain-racked fellows long for her <lb/>
visits.</p>
<p>So much was she at one with them that at <lb/>
nights she could not rest, but, lamp in hand, <lb/>
would walk along the rows of prostrate invalids, <lb/>
smoothing the pillow of one, cooling the parched <lb/>
lips of another, giving here a wondrous look of <lb/>
sympathy and there a word of comfort, till one <lb/>
man said of her, "We could kiss her shadow as <lb/>
it fell, and lay our heads again on our pillows <lb/>
content!"</p>
<p>The poet Longfellow has painted a sweet <reg orig="word-|picture">word-picture</reg> <lb/>
of her in his "Santa Filomena," and to <lb/>
many she is even now known as the "Lady with <lb/>
the Lamp."</p>
<p>But the day at last came when the stricken <lb/>
patients looked in vain for her whose very shadow <lb/>
they loved. The strongest frame could not long <lb/>
have endured the strain which Florence <reg orig="Night-|ingale">Nightingale</reg> <lb/>
put upon her slender form. In 1855 she <lb/>
was seized with a bad attack of hospital fever, and <lb/>
though she recovered sufficiently to again take up <lb/>
her arduous duties, she returned to England in <lb/>
<pb n="158" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0180"/>
1856 completely broken down; and, unhappily, <lb/>
she has ever since been an invalid.</p>
<p>The British nation had good cause to be proud <lb/>
of her, and the gratitude of the people was shown <lb/>
by their ready and generous response to the <reg orig="sug-|gestion">suggestion</reg> <lb/>
of a national testimonial. In a very short <lb/>
time the large sum of &pound;50,000 was subscribed, <lb/>
which, by the special request of Miss Nightingale, <lb/>
was devoted to the maintenance of Training Schools <lb/>
for nurses, in connection with the St. Thomas's and <lb/>
King's College Hospitals, London.</p>
<p>On her arrival in England a splendid <reg orig="recep-|tion">reception</reg> <lb/>
was given her. Queen Victoria gave her <lb/>
a personal letter of thanks and a magnificent <lb/>
Cross of St. George, ruby-red on a ground of <lb/>
white, and around it, on a black band, the words <lb/>
"Blessed are the Merciful." In the centre are <lb/>
the letters "V.R." surmounted by a crown of <lb/>
diamonds, while streaks of glistening gold radiate <lb/>
from them like the beams of the setting sun.</p>
<p>The Sultan of Turkey showed his appreciation <lb/>
of the work she had done by sending Miss <lb/>
Nightingale a very valuable diamond bracelet.</p>
<p>Through all this adulation, however, she <reg orig="re-|mained">remained</reg>, <lb/>
what she has ever been, a shy, sensitive, <lb/>
retiring woman&mdash;strong where duty called, yet <lb/>
shrinking from the public notice her noble <reg orig="fulfil-|ment">fulfilment</reg> <lb/>
of that duty has brought upon her.</p>
<p>So impressed was Queen Victoria by the <lb/>
enormous amount of good Miss Nightingale <lb/>
had done that she requested a personal interview <lb/>
with her, and it is pleasing to know that the <lb/>
good queen and her no less good subject became <lb/>
<pb n="159" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0181"/>
firm friends, and worked together for many years <lb/>
to promote the welfare of the people they both <lb/>
loved.</p>
<p>After her return Miss Nightingale devoted a <lb/>
great deal of time and thought to the bettering <lb/>
of the conditions of hospital life, to the institution <lb/>
of thorough sanitary arrangements in hospitals, <lb/>
infirmaries, reformatories, and other public <reg orig="in-|stitutions">institutions</reg>, <lb/>
and suggested many improvements in <lb/>
the construction and general management of such <lb/>
places.</p>

<div2 type="chapter" n="III" id="d58">
<head><hi rend="bold">CHAPTER III. <lb/>
Suggestions for Improvements in India.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">A number</hi> of gentlemen, forming a <reg orig="commis-|sion">commission</reg> <lb/>
of inquiry, met together at various times <lb/>
during the year 1857 to consider the <reg orig="con-|ditions">conditions</reg> <lb/>
under which the soldiers had lived and <lb/>
worked during the war in the Crimea, and Miss <lb/>
Nightingale's evidence did a great deal toward <lb/>
making the lot of the soldier happier and more <lb/>
comfortable than it had ever been before. She clearly <lb/>
proved that by far the greatest number of deaths <lb/>
during the campaign were due to sickness brought <lb/>
on by the utter neglect of all the laws of health, <lb/>
and that, even in times of peace, half the deaths <lb/>
in the army were due to the same cause.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most striking thing about this <lb/>
capable woman is, not so much her power to grasp <lb/>
a difficulty, as the ease with which she sees a way <lb/>
out of that difficulty; she, as it were, no sooner <lb/>
<pb n="160" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0182"/>
recognises the disease than she suggests the <lb/>
remedy, and it is but fair to say that her remedies <lb/>
have always been good.</p>
<p>The state of her health has prevented Miss <lb/>
Nightingale taking any further active share in <lb/>
the furtherance of her schemes; but from her <lb/>
retirement she has written many helpful books for <lb/>
the guidance of all who have charge of the sick <lb/>
and helpless, of all interested in the promotion <lb/>
of the public good, and of mothers desirous of <lb/>
rearing strong, healthy families.</p>
<p>She may, indeed, be regarded as the inventor <lb/>
of modern nursing, and it is safe to say that her <lb/>
influence in this direction is felt as well by the <lb/>
sick poor as by the king upon his throne.</p>
<p>The general improvement in hospital and barrack <lb/>
management at home led the Government to <lb/>
inquire into the state of the army in India. Each <lb/>
military station in that great country was visited, <lb/>
and a full report written upon it. These reports <lb/>
were bound up in two huge volumes, which were <lb/>
sent to Miss Nightingale to read and remark upon.</p>
<p>It was a big task&mdash;big enough to alarm a strong <lb/>
man&mdash;yet this noble woman, who had already <lb/>
given her physical strength to her country, steadily <lb/>
read through the whole, picking out the main facts, <lb/>
and setting them in order with such forceful <lb/>
comment as to make her paper one of the most <lb/>
remarkable ever written.</p>
<p>The climate of India is not good for Europeans, <lb/>
owing to the great heat, and the general dryness of <lb/>
the soil has always caused untold misery among <lb/>
the native inhabitants. But to-day India is far more <lb/>
<pb n="161" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0183"/>
prosperous than it was fifty years ago; and the <lb/>
reason is this.</p>
<p>The British Government has spent vast sums of <lb/>
money in watering the arid soil by machinery, so <lb/>
that lands which grew absolutely nothing in the <lb/>
bygone days, are now rendered fertile, and <reg orig="pro-|vide">provide</reg> <lb/>
food for vast numbers of the natives, who <lb/>
live chiefly upon rice.</p>
<p>Well, you may say, this is all very interesting <lb/>
in its way, but what has it do with Miss <lb/>
Nightingale? I will tell you.</p>
<p>When the two big report books were sent to <lb/>
her, she learned certain facts from them, which, <lb/>
with some she had gained from general reading <lb/>
and other sources of information, led her to write <lb/>
a paper, called "Life or Death in India"; and <lb/>
to this she added another, "Life or Death by <lb/>
Irrigation"&mdash;irrigation being the name given to the <lb/>
system of watering the land by hand or machinery.</p>
<p>Everything that comes from the pen of Miss <lb/>
Nightingale is sure to be of some use to her fellow <lb/>
creatures, and many of her suggestions, even on <lb/>
such a subject as making the soil of India fertile, <lb/>
were adopted by those in authority, while those <lb/>
referring to the alteration of existing barracks and <lb/>
hospitals, as well as for the building of new ones, <lb/>
have led to a great improvement, not only in the <lb/>
health of our own countrymen stationed there, but <lb/>
in that of the native troops as well.</p>
<p>Even the good of the civilians living in the <lb/>
Indian towns was duly considered, so that life in <lb/>
that far-away country has been rendered much <lb/>
more bearable for all concerned.</p>

The Friend of Women.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Miss nightingale's</hi> early interest in <lb/>
soldiers led her to take a prominent share <lb/>
in the establishment of a Medical College <lb/>
at Chatham, and it must be very gratifying to <lb/>
her to know that much good work has been <lb/>
done there. But the health of our country's <lb/>
brave defenders has always been her chief <reg orig="con-|sideration">consideration</reg>, <lb/>
and she has readily helped with both <lb/>
money and sound advice any scheme by which <lb/>
their comfort and general good might be assured.</p>
<p>Thus we find her earnestly and generously <lb/>
seconding the work so thoughtfully begun and <lb/>
so ably carried out by Miss Robinson, the Friend <lb/>
of the Soldiers, and Miss Weston, the Mother of <lb/>
the British Navy.</p>
<p>And, did her work end here, Miss Nightingale <lb/>
would have done far more than one daughter's <lb/>
share in the general management of our <reg orig="Home-|land">Homeland</reg>; <lb/>
but it by no means does so. It would <lb/>
scarcely be too much to say that her influence is <lb/>
felt to-day over the whole of the British Empire <lb/>
in the improved sanitary conditions of every <lb/>
building, be it a Government establishment, <lb/>
public institution, or private dwelling.</p>
<p>And yet she has found time to help forward the <lb/>
cause of education, both of the child and of the <lb/>
woman. Her strong, active mind rebelled years <lb/>
ago against the emptiness of the life of the <lb/>
<pb n="163" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0185"/>
ordinary woman of leisure; she would have every <lb/>
such woman fit herself for something higher than <lb/>
a mere society butterfly, and to this end she has <lb/>
ever urged the broader education of our girls.</p>
<p>Miss Nightingale holds that if we will but <lb/>
educate our girls, as we do our boys, to take an <lb/>
intelligent interest in national matters, we shall <lb/>
have more sensible electors and improved <reg orig="parlia-|ments">parliaments</reg>, <lb/>
and better government will, of necessity, <lb/>
follow.</p>
<p>She even thinks the time may come when <lb/>
women will take an active share in the affairs <lb/>
of State; and there is no doubt that, could we <lb/>
have but a few women like Miss Nightingale <lb/>
in Parliament, we should be much better prepared <lb/>
for times of stress than is frequently the case <lb/>
now.</p>
<p>Miss Nightingale is still with us, though she <lb/>
is now of advanced age; and although the 24th <lb/>
of November, 1903, was the forty-eighth anniversary <lb/>
of her landing at Scutari, she is still able to take <lb/>
more than a passing interest in the matters that <lb/>
have ever appealed to her.</p>
<p>Her name is associated with all that is good <lb/>
and true and noble, and as she looks back over <lb/>
her long and eminently useful life, she must be <lb/>
comforted by the knowledge that the world has <lb/>
been all the better for her presence in it.</p>
<p>Of the talents with which her Master intrusted <lb/>
her, she has made the very best use. The sick <lb/>
and suffering and helpless have been comforted <lb/>
by her; the strong and healthy have been enabled <lb/>
to live and move in a purer atmosphere; the mind <lb/>
<pb n="164" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0186"/>
athirst for knowledge has been satisfied through <lb/>
her efforts; the spiritual welfare of all has received <lb/>
her earnest consideration. She lives to-day in the <lb/>
hearts of the British people, and the poet wrote <lb/>
truly, when he penned the words&mdash; <lb/>

<div2 type="chapter" n="I" id="d61">
<head><hi rend="bold">CHAPTER I. <lb/>
Choosing the Path.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Elizabeth fry</hi>, well known as the Prison <lb/>
Philanthropist, was born at Norwich on the <lb/>
21st of May, 1780. She was the descendant <lb/>
of notable Quaker families, and, while her parents <lb/>
were not what are <lb/>
known as <hi rend="italic">plain</hi> <lb/>
Quakers, they were <lb/>
loyal members of the <lb/>
Society of Friends.</p>
<figure id="f14" rend="inline" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0187"/>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. John <lb/>
Gurney trained their <lb/>
family in all piety, <lb/>
teaching them from <lb/>
the truths of the New <lb/>
Testament rather than <lb/>
from any one man's <lb/>
views of God's Word, and educating them in all <lb/>
such subjects as would most fully develop their <lb/>
minds and help them to become efficient both in <lb/>
domestic and social life.</p>
<p>Elizabeth was one of twelve children, and, being <lb/>
somewhat delicate, shy, and nervous, was thought <lb/>
to be not quite as bright as some of the others. <lb/>
She was, however, very fond of her own way and <lb/>
her own opinion, and, in after years, was said to <lb/>
be a woman of great decision of character.</p>
<p>Like her brothers and sisters, she enjoyed much <lb/>
<pb n="166" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0188"/>
more freedom than is usually allowed to young <lb/>
people of her sect; yet, while she was very fond <lb/>
of music, and dancing, and the conversation of the <lb/>
more broad-minded people outside the Society of <lb/>
Friends, she yearned for something more satisfying.</p>
<p>She was much given to examining herself and <lb/>
her actions, with the happy result that she was <lb/>
enabled to overcome many little weaknesses; yet <lb/>
the need of more spiritual help to do this was <lb/>
ever present in her mind, and this she found after <lb/>
much earnest seeking.</p>
<p>Becoming aware of her leaning towards a <reg orig="dis-|tinctly">distinctly</reg> <lb/>
spiritual life, Elizabeth's father decided to <lb/>
give her ample opportunity for discovering if this <lb/>
would be as really satisfying to her nature as she <lb/>
hoped. He therefore sent her to London, where <lb/>
she saw the finest actors of the day, heard the best <lb/>
music and singing, met and conversed with some <lb/>
of the most eminent people; yet, in the end, she <lb/>
returned more fully confirmed in the course she <lb/>
had determined to follow.</p>
<p>From the decision thus made Elizabeth Fry <lb/>
never swerved, though the yearnings of the soul <lb/>
were often strongly opposed by the longings of <lb/>
the flesh. Had there been no such battle, it is <lb/>
possible that her career had been of a totally <lb/>
different character. Like many other good people <lb/>
for whose existence the world has been all the <lb/>
better, she disliked an easy victory, while an <lb/>
obstacle to the fulfilment of a purpose roused all <lb/>
her natural obstinacy and determination to win.</p>
<p>As is usual with all members of the Society of <lb/>
Friends, the Gurney family had been taught to be <lb/>
<pb n="167" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0189"/>
kind and helpful to the poor; but now Elizabeth <lb/>
began to take a marked interest in the education <lb/>
of their little ones, and succeeded in establishing <lb/>
and managing a school of no less than seventy <lb/>
children. This early training was of the utmost <lb/>
use to her in the work she took up later.</p>
<p>In her anxiety to be really good, she ceased <lb/>
from taking any pleasure in the things which had <lb/>
hitherto been her chief delights, wore the plainest <lb/>
clothes, and, in due time, strictly observed all <lb/>
the customs, as she imbibed the teachings, of the <lb/>
plain Quakers. This meant a certain degree of <lb/>
alienation from the members of her family; but <lb/>
such considerations were weighed with thoughtful <lb/>
care, and were not allowed to interfere with what <lb/>
she had come to consider her duty to God.</p>
<p>Her mother had now been dead some years, and <lb/>
her father saw no reason to interfere further; but <lb/>
it is nevertheless true that she was in great need <lb/>
of a guiding hand, for, in writing of this period <lb/>
of her life, she says, "I was like the blind man&mdash; <lb/>
although I could hardly have been said to have <lb/>
attained the state of seeing men as trees;" and <lb/>
again, "The glad tidings of the Gospel were very <lb/>
little, if at all, understood by me."</p>
<p>When about twenty years of age, Elizabeth was <lb/>
asked in marriage by Joseph Fry, of London. He, <lb/>
too, was the child of Quaker parents, people of <lb/>
good social standing, and very rich. The proposal <lb/>
was accepted after long and anxious thought; and, <lb/>
on 19th August, 1800, the marriage was solemnised <lb/>
in the Friends' Meeting House, Norwich.</p>
<p>Mr. Joseph Fry's business being in London, the <lb/>
<pb n="168" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0190"/>
young people made their home for some time in <lb/>
that city. Her husband's people were very strict <lb/>
plain Quakers; so Elizabeth's new mode of life <lb/>
was less singular to them than it had been to <lb/>
her own family, and she soon became quite as <lb/>
simple in dress and speech as even the plainest <lb/>
Quaker could desire.</p>
<p>Yet each of these steps towards true godliness, <lb/>
as she conceived it, marked a victory won; for she <lb/>
was naturally gay and winsome, fond of pretty <lb/>
things and pleasing manners, and many a battle <lb/>
did she fight with pride ere she finally adopted <lb/>
the cap and kerchief, and the <hi rend="italic">thee</hi> and <hi rend="italic">thou</hi> of the <lb/>
strictest of her sect.</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="II" id="d62">
<head><hi rend="bold">CHAPTER II. <lb/>
Life at Plashet.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">As</hi> the years passed, her home and family <lb/>
occupied a goodly portion of her time, but <lb/>
she managed to spare a little in carrying out <lb/>
her desire to be of some practical use to the poor <lb/>
and helpless.</p>
<p>In the alleys and slums of London, Mrs. Fry <lb/>
found much more work than she could hope to <lb/>
cope with, yet, undismayed, she did what she <lb/>
could toward brightening the lives and relieving <lb/>
the necessities of many struck down with sickness <lb/>
and disease, poverty and utter hopelessness.</p>
<p>And these cases were not brought to her notice: <lb/>
she found them for herself by visiting the wretched <lb/>
dwellings in court and alley, in fetid street and <lb/>
<pb n="169" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0191"/>
uninviting lane. Her old longing to do something <lb/>
for the minds as well as for the bodies of these <lb/>
people induced her to visit the Friends' School at <lb/>
Islington, where the education of the children <lb/>
interested her greatly.</p>
<p>On the death of her husband's father, the family <lb/>
left London to make their home at Plashet, in <lb/>
Essex, and Mrs. Fry describes her life there as a <lb/>
"time of sunshine." She and the children roamed <lb/>
the woods and fields of the neighbourhood, <reg orig="gather-|ing">gathering</reg> <lb/>
the roots of many beautiful wild flowers and <lb/>
plants and setting them in the quiet corners of their <lb/>
own lovely garden; for Elizabeth Fry had ever an <lb/>
artist's love for natural beauty.</p>
<p>Despite her seeming happiness in home and <lb/>
children, however, Mrs. Fry felt that she had <lb/>
wandered sadly from the course she had mapped <lb/>
out for herself when a girl; but the time came <lb/>
when she was able to look upon this period of <lb/>
her life as a blessed training for that particular <lb/>
work which the future held in store for her.</p>
<p>After the death of her father in the year 1809, <lb/>
she became convinced that it was God's will she <lb/>
should bear testimony for Him at the meeting of <lb/>
Friends, and this she was enabled to do by the <lb/>
sanction of the Society. She shrank with womanly <lb/>
modesty from speaking to a public audience; yet, <lb/>
so strong was the spirit of God within her, that she <lb/>
felt compelled to do so, and thereafter she became <lb/>
an acknowledged minister of the society.</p>
<p>By the aid of two friends she next founded a <lb/>
school, close to her home, on the well-known <lb/>
monitor system, and this school continued to be <lb/>
<pb n="170" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0192"/>
well governed and prosperous for a great number <lb/>
of years.</p>
<p>Recognising the needs of her poor neighbours, <lb/>
Mrs. Fry supplied them with warm clothing, <lb/>
established a soup-kitchen at the rear of her house, <lb/>
gave them Bibles to lead them heavenward, and <lb/>
medicine to heal their sickness.</p>
<p>She discovered the almost hopeless condition of <lb/>
life of a local colony of Irish people, and at once <lb/>
assisted their priest to teach them something higher <lb/>
and nobler, with the result that in time many of <lb/>
them became quite respectable, quiet-living, <reg orig="God-|fearing">God-fearing</reg> <lb/>
men and women.</p>
<p>To the gipsies who paid frequent visits to the <lb/>
place she was, indeed, a good fairy. Neither creed <lb/>
nor nationality weighed with her in the slightest <lb/>
degree; it was but necessary for her to know that <lb/>
a fellow creature needed help, and all that woman <lb/>
could do she did for the needy one. By her ready <lb/>
generous assistance, and quiet unobtrusive guiding <lb/>
of the soul upward, she won many a despairing <lb/>
one back to the paths of truth and righteousness, <lb/>
of self-dependence and honourable living</p>

<div2 type="chapter" n="III" id="d63">
<head><hi rend="bold">CHAPTER III. <lb/>
First Work among Prisoners.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Prison</hi> life during the eighteenth century was <lb/>
anything but a bed of roses. We sometimes <lb/>
read at the present time of people who actually <lb/>
commit certain small offences so that they may be <lb/>
<pb n="171" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0193"/>
sent to prison, where they are much better off in <lb/>
every way than in their wretched homes; but in <lb/>
those old days it must have been the earnest desire <lb/>
of even the poorest and most depraved to escape <lb/>
from the pestilential uncleanness, and, in many <lb/>
cases, absolute starvation of the ill-kept and <lb/>
badly-governed jails of the time.</p>
<p>Criminals of the deepest dye and unfortunate <lb/>
people imprisoned for debt, as well as many an <lb/>
innocent victim of some evil but successful plot, <lb/>
were packed together in spaces so small that the <lb/>
very air teemed with disease.</p>
<p>Degraded women, utterly lost to all sense of <lb/>
decency and self-respect, given to uncontrolled <lb/>
outbursts of violence, from whose lips issued <lb/>
nothing but loathsome vileness, were allowed to <lb/>
have their innocent little ones with them, sowing <lb/>
in their small minds seeds which one day would <lb/>
bring forth terrible crops of wickedness.</p>
<p>No inducements were held out to the poor <lb/>
wretches to become other than the depraved <reg orig="crea-|tures">creatures</reg> <lb/>
they were; indeed, the very lack of all effort <lb/>
to show that they were regarded as human made <lb/>
these jails very hot-beds for the breeding of crime <lb/>
and disorder.</p>
<p>No food, no clothing, no beds even were <reg orig="pro-|vided">provided</reg> <lb/>
for the unhappy creatures; so men and <lb/>
women slept on the floors in their filthy rags, or, <lb/>
lacking room to lie down, stood throughout the <lb/>
livelong night.</p>
<p>Nothing was obtainable except by payment; <lb/>
so those who could neither beg nor borrow the <lb/>
wherewithal to buy the necessaries, starved and <lb/>
<pb n="172" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0194"/>
died, neglected and unregretted by all. <reg orig="Intoxi-|cants">Intoxicants</reg> <lb/>
could be purchased within the prison walls <lb/>
by all who possessed the means to pay for them; <lb/>
while, such was the looseness of supervision and <lb/>
the unsuitability of some of the buildings that, to <lb/>
add to their woes, the wretched creatures were <lb/>
chained and fettered to prevent their escape.</p>
<p>Many of the prisoners were kept for years in <lb/>
these dreadful places simply because they had no <lb/>
means, on the expiry of their sentences, to pay the <lb/>
large sums of money demanded by the inhuman <lb/>
jail-keepers. Torture was not unknown, and, <lb/>
worst of all, there was absolutely no work of any <lb/>
kind whereby the hapless wretches could while <lb/>
away the time.</p>
<p>Space does not permit further mention of these <lb/>
horrors, of which simply to read is heart-rending; <lb/>
how much more so, then, when actually witnessed!</p>
<p>When Elizabeth Fry first became interested in <lb/>
prisoners and their sad lot, many of these abuses <lb/>
had been modified, and some slight organisation <lb/>
in jail management had been effected; yet what <lb/>
she found so appalled her that her endeavours to <lb/>
lessen the evils and to lift the prisoners out of <lb/>
their Slough of Despond never relaxed.</p>
<p>It was not until the year 1817, however, that <lb/>
freedom from family cares and personal illness <lb/>
allowed her to take up steady and continuous <lb/>
work for the improvement of both prisons and <lb/>
prisoners, and this was begun and continued for <lb/>
many years at Newgate Jail, London.</p>
<p>With true motherly instinct she won the love <lb/>
of the women by kindness to their children, and <lb/>
<pb n="173" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0195"/>
they met with pleasure a proposal to establish a <lb/>
school for the benefit of their little ones. One of <lb/>
their own number, a young woman of fair <reg orig="educa-|tion">education</reg>, <lb/>
imprisoned for a first offence, was given <lb/>
charge of this school, which she conducted to the <lb/>
satisfaction of all during the remainder of her <lb/>
stay in the prison.</p>
<p>That these women retained some love for their <lb/>
children showed them to be not utterly lost; it is, <lb/>
nevertheless, surprising that some of them regarded <lb/>
Mrs. Fry's efforts on their own behalf with much <lb/>
satisfaction, for it is well known that, as a rule, this <lb/>
class of people is particularly hard to get at. So <lb/>
encouraging was their conduct that the prison <lb/>
authorities gladly aided the good lady's efforts as <lb/>
much as they could.</p>
<p>Many philanthropic and wealthy people, <reg orig="know-|ing">knowing</reg> <lb/>
that such work needed money, sent liberal <lb/>
contributions; while a few ladies&mdash;principally <lb/>
Quakeresses&mdash;banded themselves together to <reg orig="pro-|vide">provide</reg> <lb/>
clothing, education, and work for the female <lb/>
convicts, as well as to teach them orderly and <lb/>
cleanly habits, and to show them, from God's <lb/>
Word, what He requires of all His children <lb/>
here on earth.</p>
<p>A set of rules for the maintenance of order, <lb/>
and regular Bible instruction among the women, <lb/>
was drawn up, and it was duly impressed upon <lb/>
them that it was necessary they should keep to <lb/>
these rules for their own good.</p>
<p>A room was fitted up, materials provided, and <lb/>
the women set to work to make clothing for <reg orig="them-|selves">themselves</reg> <lb/>
and others in the prison, as well as for those <lb/>
<pb n="174" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0196"/>
prisoners sent to the penal settlements at Botany <lb/>
Bay.</p>
<p>So now there are two evidences of the good effected <lb/>
by Mrs. Fry and her willing helpers&mdash;the school and <lb/>
the workroom; and these the authorities willingly <lb/>
included in the regular system of city prison <lb/>
management, and granted a yearly sum of money <lb/>
toward the salary of a capable matron.</p>
<p>They were keenly alive to the change for the better <lb/>
in the female prisoners, and met all Mrs. Fry's <lb/>
suggestions so warmly that in time many <reg orig="improve-|ments">improvements</reg> <lb/>
were made, among which may be mentioned <lb/>
the separation of male and female prisoners, and <lb/>
the regular supply of food, clothing, and soap, <lb/>
while constant work was found for all!</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="IV" id="d64">
<head><hi rend="bold">CHAPTER IV. <lb/>
Working against Death Sentences.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">A great</hi> deal of the unruly conduct in the <lb/>
jails was no doubt due to the fact that friends <lb/>
of the prisoners were allowed to visit them <lb/>
freely and to supply them with as much beer as <lb/>
they had the means to procure. A stop was at <lb/>
length put to this, and a small store was opened <lb/>
within the prison walls where tea, sugar, and <lb/>
other things could be bought with the money <lb/>
allowed the prisoners from the proceeds of their <lb/>
work.</p>
<p>In addition to the money given them for <lb/>
this purpose, a small weekly amount was put <lb/>
<pb n="175" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0197"/>
by, so that, on the expiration of her term of <lb/>
imprisonment, each woman had a small sum <lb/>
of money wherewith to supply her immediate <lb/>
wants.</p>
<p>A large number of garments were made annually, <lb/>
and much knitting was done, for the prisoners were <lb/>
now compelled, according to the rules they had <lb/>
themselves approved, to work a certain number <lb/>
of hours each day. All the articles not needed <lb/>
for the use of the convicts were sold to what <lb/>
were called slop-shops, and, while the amount <lb/>
thus derived was certainly not great, the fact <lb/>
that it was earned made the women more <reg orig="self-|respecting">self-respecting</reg>; <lb/>
and the knowledge that they <reg orig="them-|selves">themselves</reg> <lb/>
would have a portion of it gave an interest <lb/>
in the work even to those who would have preferred <lb/>
to remain idle.</p>
<p>Mrs. Fry's admirable management of these <lb/>
hitherto scorned and neglected creatures was <lb/>
really wonderful. Her calm, grave, earnest talks <lb/>
led them to realise that they were responsible <lb/>
beings, that certain duties were theirs to perform; <lb/>
that they were the children of an all-wise Father, <lb/>
who loved them despite their wilfulness, and who <lb/>
would most assuredly one day ask them to give <lb/>
an account of the talents with which He had <lb/>
entrusted them.</p>
<p>Mrs. Fry believed firmly in the system of <lb/>
rewards, and, at fixed times, presents of clothing <lb/>
or Bibles were given to the women who had <lb/>
conducted themselves best. Although a room for <lb/>
the punishment of unruly prisoners had been set <lb/>
apart for her use, Mrs. Fry had no need of it, <lb/>
<pb n="176" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0198"/>
inasmuch as her gentle firmness and loving-<reg orig="kind-|ness">kindness</reg> <lb/>
had much greater power for good than the <lb/>
fear of bodily punishment.</p>
<p>These poor creatures were so really hardened to <lb/>
suffering; and death by hanging was so common <lb/>
in those days that the fear of it in no wise deterred <lb/>
men or women from committing sin.</p>
<p>What we now call minor offences were then <lb/>
crimes whose punishment was death; for the <lb/>
judges were men who were not ashamed to say <lb/>
publicly that there was no hope for a felon on <lb/>
earth. To send him across the seas was to scatter <lb/>
crime broadcast, while to keep him in his own <lb/>
country gave him no chance to reform, and <reg orig="there-|fore">therefore</reg> <lb/>
the best thing for himself and the world at <lb/>
large was to put him to death.</p>
<p>Well for the judged and well for the judges <lb/>
that so noble a band as Elizabeth Fry and her <lb/>
co-workers arose to combat such judgments!</p>
<p>Of justice none can complain, but where was <lb/>
the justice in hanging a woman for stealing a <lb/>
piece of cloth to buy bread for her starving child? <lb/>
Where the justice in hanging a man for maiming <lb/>
a wild deer, or for cutting a hop-band in a <reg orig="plan-|tation">plantation</reg>? <lb/>
Besides, these severe laws defeated their <lb/>
own ends.</p>
<p>People who had been robbed, or wronged <lb/>
in some other way, kept it to themselves, <reg orig="be-|cause">because</reg> <lb/>
they hesitated to condemn a fellow-being <lb/>
to death; so the wrong-doer, trading upon his <lb/>
neighbour's kind-heartedness, went from bad to <lb/>
worse, until no one was safe. It is said that, <lb/>
had all the death sentences been carried out, four <lb/>
<pb n="177" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0199"/>
persons would have been hanged daily in our <lb/>
so-called Christian land.</p>
<p>This, however, was not the only evil which <lb/>
needed reform, for the horrors which Mrs. Fry <lb/>
and some of her family discovered existing in <lb/>
many of the prisons of the north of England, <lb/>
and Scotland especially, were such that hanging <lb/>
was merciful in comparison. Many leading men <lb/>
of the day, as well as influential Quaker families, <lb/>
made such telling appeals for mercy, to those <lb/>
in authority, that a few of the death sentences were <lb/>
remitted from time to time.</p>
<p>At length the real value of human life was <reg orig="recog-|nised">recognised</reg> <lb/>
by the general mass of people, and steps were <lb/>
taken which eventually led to the abolition of the <lb/>
death penalty for all offences save high treason, <lb/>
forgery, and murder, and this was without doubt <lb/>
largely due to the unwearying efforts of Elizabeth <lb/>
Fry. Her clear, convincing evidence of the agonies <lb/>
of mind endured by persons condemned to death <lb/>
for really small crimes, interested not only <reg orig="com-|moners">commoners</reg> <lb/>
but lords as well, and at length even <lb/>
Queen Charlotte interviewed the good Quakeress <lb/>
on the subject.</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="V" id="d65">
<head><hi rend="bold">CHAPTER V. <lb/>
Helping Transported Prisoners.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">It</hi> was the custom to convey all prisoners <lb/>
sentenced to transportation from the jails <lb/>
to the convict-ships in open vehicles, and, lest <lb/>
they should attempt to escape, many of them were <lb/>
<pb n="178" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0200"/>
chained in a most cruel fashion. Such a procession <lb/>
through the streets always drew crowds of low <lb/>
people after it, and the noise and confusion was <lb/>
really dreadful.</p>
<p>Mrs. Fry now sought to remedy this by <reg orig="sug-|gesting">suggesting</reg> <lb/>
that closed carriages should be used, and <lb/>
properly secured, so that the chains should not be <lb/>
needed. Her advice was, as usual, followed, and <lb/>
the degrading processions ceased.</p>
<p>Many of the women condemned to exile had <lb/>
passed through Mrs. Fry's hands at Newgate, <lb/>
and she now advised that they should be <reg orig="pro-|vided">provided</reg> <lb/>
with sewing and knitting materials for <lb/>
their employment during their long voyage <lb/>
to Australia; that the work thus done should <lb/>
become the property of the women, so that by <lb/>
selling it at their journey's end they might have <lb/>
a little money wherewith to procure decent <reg orig="lodg-|ing">lodging</reg>; <lb/>
further, that the women should be divided <lb/>
into classes under a monitor, and that the children <lb/>
accompanying their mothers should be regularly <lb/>
taught by an appointed teacher.</p>
<p>It seems almost beyond belief that the <reg orig="Govern-|ment">Government</reg> <lb/>
of that period should send shiploads of <lb/>
women to a distant land without having made any <lb/>
proper provision for them on landing. Such, <lb/>
however, was the case; and these women, who <lb/>
were exiled from their native land for their own <lb/>
and their country's good, were just carried out <lb/>
to the new colonies in Australia, and set ashore <lb/>
with no home and no means of getting one.</p>
<p>What wonder, then, that, instead of leading new <lb/>
and better lives, the poor homeless creatures sank <lb/>
<pb entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0201"/>

<pb n="179" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0203"/>
lower and lower, and, what was even worse, <lb/>
introduced their evil ways into the communities <lb/>
of which they now formed a deplorable part.</p>
<p>One of the resident chaplains in Paramatta, <lb/>
finding that his appeals to the Government were <lb/>
fruitless, wrote to Mrs. Fry, asking her to use her <lb/>
influence on behalf of these women, and in course <lb/>
of time a large home or barrack was erected for <lb/>
their reception.</p>
<p>Some few years passed before this building could <lb/>
be said to be properly managed, but at last a <lb/>
well-ordered, comfortable home awaited the weary <lb/>
travellers, in which they could remain until they <lb/>
secured employment, and where they could <lb/>
find a temporary resting-place when exchanging <lb/>
situations.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Mrs. Fry had, with the assistance <lb/>
of another lady named Mrs. Pryor, continued <lb/>
her work on the transports, and their efforts met <lb/>
with the happiest results. Just as she had secured <lb/>
female attendants for female prisoners in the <lb/>
jails, so now she obtained the appointment of <lb/>
matrons on board the convict-ships, being greatly <lb/>
helped in this, as in all other of her good works, <lb/>
by a guild of women known as the "British <lb/>
Ladies' Society."</p>
<p>She never failed to pay a farewell visit to each <lb/>
ship before it left the Thames, when a suitable <lb/>
passage was read from the Bible and an earnest <lb/>
prayer offered to God on behalf of those about to <lb/>
leave their native shores.</p>
<p>Through the never-wearying efforts of a <lb/>
devoted few, chief of whom was Elizabeth Fry, <lb/>
<pb n="180" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0204"/>
the scandalous horrors of Newgate and other <lb/>
jails had become things of the past. <reg orig="Jail-|keepers">Jail-keepers</reg> <lb/>
no longer had power to detain poor <lb/>
debtors in unspeakable wretchedness for unlimited <lb/>
periods; the torture of miserable creatures driven <lb/>
mad by the condition under which they existed <lb/>
was no longer possible; ruinous buildings which <lb/>
could not even be called shelters ceased to be <lb/>
thought suitable for the detention of criminals.</p>
<p>All prisoners were now decently clothed and fed, <lb/>
regular employment provided for them, proper <lb/>
quarters arranged for men and women, religious <lb/>
and secular instruction given them, and a <reg orig="well-|ordered">well-ordered</reg> <lb/>
system of supervision instituted; while <lb/>
the officials, both male and female, had their <lb/>
duties clearly defined, and a set of rules was <lb/>
drawn up, which all were bound to obey.</p>
<p>Of course these improvements were the result <lb/>
of long-continued effort which none but an <reg orig="all-|enduring">all-enduring</reg>, <lb/>
steadfast being, sustained by God <lb/>
Himself, could so persistently have maintained. <lb/>
Philanthropists of various kinds England had <lb/>
never lacked, but it remained for the shrinking, <lb/>
reserved Quakeress, Elizabeth Fry, to lead the <lb/>
van of prison philanthropy, and how she did it <lb/>
her works do testify.</p>
<p>Her name became known throughout the length <lb/>
and breadth of the land, and her teachings took <lb/>
root in the hearts of thousands who hitherto had <lb/>
given less than a passing thought to the wretched <lb/>
prisoners and criminals languishing in the foul, <lb/>
mismanaged jails.</p>
<p>A good man named Sir Samuel Romilly had <lb/>
<pb n="181" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0205"/>
been waging a war against capital punishment <lb/>
for some years, and was greatly helped therein <lb/>
by a band of workers known as the "Society for <lb/>
Diffusing Information on the subject of Capital <lb/>
Punishment by Death;" but Elizabeth Fry was <lb/>
the first to bring home to the public mind that <lb/>
people were punished in order to improve them&mdash; <lb/>
that, while punishment was bound to follow crime, <lb/>
it was intended as a preventive to further crime <lb/>
and not inflicted as a means of vengeance for <lb/>
crime committed.</p>
<p>Also, she contended that there should be some <lb/>
proportion between the sin and its punishment; for, <lb/>
she argued, it was out of all reason that a man who <lb/>
stole a few shillings should be made to pay the <lb/>
same penalty as one who murdered his neighbour.</p>
<p>Again, she showed clearly that the system of <lb/>
herding all sorts and conditions of criminals in a <lb/>
common room was far more likely to lead to further <lb/>
crime than to the reform of the prisoners; that the <lb/>
custom of allowing male attendants in the women's <lb/>
quarters was not calculated to do good; that <lb/>
these evils might be remedied by dividing the <lb/>
prisoners into classes, according to the gravity of <lb/>
their crimes, and by the appointment of female <lb/>
warders under a matron, to control the female <lb/>
prisoners.</p>
<p>She urged that great care should be taken to <lb/>
appoint only such matrons as should be specially <lb/>
suited to undertake the difficult task of firm yet <lb/>
kindly management, and the raising by example <lb/>
and precept of the prisoners to a higher level of <lb/>
life.</p>

<head><hi rend="bold">CHAPTER VI. <lb/>
Helping the Lonely.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">One</hi> of the modes of punishment in those days <lb/>
was what is known as the solitary system, <lb/>
and against this Mrs. Fry worked long and <lb/>
diligently, as she did also against the silent <lb/>
system. She said it was not good for anyone <lb/>
to be completely shut off from his fellows, as, <lb/>
instead of thinking of and regretting his sins, <lb/>
he became morose, more evil-minded, and apt to <lb/>
lose his reason, and was, furthermore, liable to <lb/>
undue punishment by violent officials; while <lb/>
women punished thus were not so well prepared <lb/>
to return to their homes and duties as if they <lb/>
had been allowed to mix with others in an orderly <lb/>
manner, under proper surveillance.</p>
<p>She strongly disapproved, however, of herding <lb/>
the prisoners together at night, when much mischief <lb/>
might be plotted, and suggested a separate cubicle <lb/>
for each.</p>
<p>The use of dark cells and dungeons was to <lb/>
her a most inhuman form of punishment, and <lb/>
she begged that those already in existence should <lb/>
never more be used, while in the construction of <lb/>
new jails they should not be included. She was <lb/>
not so foolish as to wish that great crimes should <lb/>
not be fittingly atoned for, but she urged that <lb/>
at least a small bit of the sky should be visible <lb/>
even to the worst sinners.</p>
<p>The welfare of the criminal while in jail did <lb/>
<pb n="183" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0207"/>
not exhaust her interest in him, as is shown by <lb/>
her anxiety that homes should be provided for <lb/>
the reception of females discharged from jail, <lb/>
and a society of British ladies helped her to <lb/>
accomplish this.</p>
<p>Homes and shelters were founded in most of our <lb/>
large towns; while a specially arranged "School <lb/>
for Discipline" at Chelsea, for the reformation of <lb/>
young girls newly discharged from prison, or <lb/>
others who had neither homes nor the means <lb/>
of getting them, kept many from taking the <lb/>
first step downward, and others from sinning <lb/>
further.</p>
<p>While visiting a south coast watering-place for <lb/>
the benefit of her health, Mrs. Fry was much <lb/>
struck by the lonely, monotonous lives of the <lb/>
coastguardsmen and their families. These men <lb/>
are stationed at intervals along the coast to <reg orig="pre-|vent">prevent</reg> <lb/>
goods being smuggled into the country, and <lb/>
as it frequently happens that a coastguard station <lb/>
is far away from a town, or even a village, Mrs. <lb/>
Fry was by no means mistaken in thinking their <lb/>
lives at any time must be fairly uninteresting; but <lb/>
especially so during the long winter evenings. She <lb/>
therefore decided to raise a fund wherewith to <lb/>
supply them with books, and so well did she <lb/>
succeed, that, in time, every coastguard station in <lb/>
the United Kingdom was provided with Bibles <lb/>
and Testaments, the gifts of the Religious Tract <lb/>
Society, and a library of fifty-two different books <lb/>
each. Her next step was to do the same for <lb/>
some of the men-of-war, so that the men might <lb/>
have something to read during their voyages. <lb/>
<pb n="184" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0208"/>
The result of this effort was that many cruisers <lb/>
and packets were supplied with good libraries, <lb/>
tracts, and pamphlets; while the children of the <lb/>
crews were provided with lesson books.</p>
<p>A large sum of money was required to <reg orig="accom-|plish">accomplish</reg> <lb/>
all this, and it is very pleasing to know <lb/>
that the Government gave generous donations <lb/>
towards the fund.</p>
<p>Happening to pass through Hampshire some <lb/>
time later, Mrs. Fry became interested in the <lb/>
shepherds who kept their flocks on Salisbury <lb/>
Plain, and realising that their lives, too, might <lb/>
be brightened by reading, she rested not till she <lb/>
had raised sufficient money to give them a library <lb/>
of forty-five well selected books, and was gratified <lb/>
afterwards by learning that they were in constant <lb/>
demand by the scattered dwellers in that lonely <lb/>
district.</p>
<p>The fame of this noble woman spread far and <lb/>
wide. Emperors, kings, queens, princes, indeed <lb/>
the highest as well as the lowest of peoples both <lb/>
at home and on the Continent, joined to do her <lb/>
reverence. She was an honoured guest at the <lb/>
Courts of Europe, and perhaps no commoner ever <lb/>
received so many Royal visitors in her own home <lb/>
as did this simple Quaker lady.</p>
<p>Her calm dignity, her unerring judgment, her <lb/>
unswerving devotion to the teachings of the <lb/>
Bible, her untiring efforts for both soul and body <lb/>
of fallen humanity, her convincing testimony on <lb/>
the subject nearest her heart&mdash;namely, prisons <lb/>
and prisoners&mdash;could not fail to attract all that <lb/>
was best in everyone with whom she came in <lb/>
<pb n="185" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0209"/>
contact. Each word she spoke rang true and <lb/>
carried conviction with it.</p>
<p>She had a special interview with our late beloved <lb/>
Queen Victoria, and dined with the Prince-Consort <lb/>
some time later, and on each occasion she pleaded <lb/>
her cause as only she could plead.</p>
<p>So great and wide-spreading was the belief in <lb/>
her judgment of prison matters that her advice <lb/>
was sought by the leading Governments of the <lb/>
Continent. She travelled many thousands of <lb/>
miles, visited numbers of jails, and had the <lb/>
happiness of seeing her suggested improvements <lb/>
carried out during her lifetime.</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="VII" id="d67">
<head><hi rend="bold">CHAPTER VII. <lb/>
The End of a Useful Life.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Although</hi> Elizabeth Fry accomplished so <lb/>
much outside her home, it must not be <reg orig="sup-|posed">supposed</reg> <lb/>
that she neglected those within it. She <lb/>
had a large family of sons and daughters, whose <lb/>
home life and education she supervised with great <lb/>
care and discrimination, and who loved her with <lb/>
more than even the usual affection of children for <lb/>
a good parent.</p>
<p>She was esteemed and revered by her relatives, <lb/>
and to her husband she was a constant source of <lb/>
comfort. Joseph Fry travelled with his wife on <lb/>
many of her journeys of love, as did also some <lb/>
of her children and relatives, smoothing her way <lb/>
and helping her in all that she did.</p>
<pb n="186" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0210"/>
<p>To them she was the one woman in all the <lb/>
world. They had seen her in prosperity and in <lb/>
adversity, they had witnessed her heroic struggles <lb/>
against physical weakness, they had heard her <lb/>
advise kings and queens, they had been with her <lb/>
when the Father of all had called one of her little <lb/>
ones back to His fold, and they reverenced her in <lb/>
that, through all, she remained the simple, <reg orig="plain-|speaking">plain-speaking</reg>, <lb/>
large-hearted Quaker lady, who in early <lb/>
life had yearned for a life lived unto God, who <lb/>
murmured not when affliction overtook her, and <lb/>
who, by her tender care of His little ones, had <lb/>
proved the genuineness of her youthful longings.</p>
<p>And when, at a not very advanced age, weakness <lb/>
and pain prevented her taking any further active <lb/>
share in God's work, she resigned herself to His <lb/>
will with a sweetness and humility that still further <lb/>
endeared her to her friends. Her wonderful mind <lb/>
remained clear to the end, and she was able to <lb/>
deliver her thoughts with such telling power that <lb/>
all who listened were amazed. Almost to the last <lb/>
she attended the meeting of Friends, being taken <lb/>
there in a wheel-chair by some of her children.</p>
<p>In writing to a friend about this time, she said, <lb/>
"I pass through deep waters, but I trust, as my <lb/>
Lord is near to me, they will not overflow me." <lb/>
These sad yet hopeful words referred to the deaths <lb/>
of some members of her family; but her cup of <lb/>
sorrow was not yet full. Several more passed <lb/>
away ere she herself was called to join them in <lb/>
the kingdom where there are no more partings, <lb/>
neither sorrow nor crying.</p>
<p>Though her spirit was sustained through all <lb/>
<pb n="187" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0211"/>
these trials, her bodily weakness increased, and, <lb/>
on 13th October 1845, she was called home, and <lb/>
who shall say how many a soul waited there to <lb/>
welcome her whose hand had arrested a rapid <lb/>
course to destruction, and pointed to that narrow <lb/>
way which had led them to eternal life?</p>
<p>Surely, if there are degrees in heaven, Elizabeth <lb/>
Fry must be one of its very brightest angels, and <lb/>
the Father's greeting to her must as surely have <lb/>
been, "Well done, thou good and faithful servant, <lb/>
enter thou into the joy of thy Lord."</p>
<p>She was laid to rest in the quiet graveyard at <lb/>
Barking, beside the little daughter who had gone <lb/>
so many years before; and no more appropriate <lb/>
words with which to close this brief sketch of her <lb/>
useful life can be found, than those which she <lb/>
herself quoted at one of the last meetings she <lb/>
attended: "Blessed are the dead who die in the <lb/>
Lord, for they cease from their labours, and their <lb/>
works do follow them."</p>

<head><hi rend="bold">MRS. ISABEL REANEY, <lb/>
THE WORKING-MAN'S FRIEND.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Fifty-six</hi> years ago there was born in <lb/>
Huntingdon a child destined to fulfil a certain <lb/>
mission in life. She was the daughter of <lb/>
Robert Edis, Esq., of that town, and sister of <lb/>
A. W. Edis, now a celebrated London physician. <lb/>
This brother was her great example; as a child <lb/>
she ruled her life by his: hence her endeavour, <lb/>
at the early age of nine years, to be useful in <lb/>
the world.</p>
<p>She visited the cottages of the poor people, <lb/>
threading needles for the aged, talking freely to <lb/>
them of Jesus, and His work on earth, until she <lb/>
became an expected and welcome visitor.</p>
<p>This went on for some years, and at last it <lb/>
became a custom for her to hold a Sunday <reg orig="after-|noon">afternoon</reg> <lb/>
meeting in one of the cottages. The men, <lb/>
hearing their wives speak of the young girl's sweet <lb/>
words, felt tempted to go and listen also, and so, <lb/>
Sunday after Sunday, men, women, and children <lb/>
flocked to the house of their neighbour, just in <lb/>
their simple clothing, with neither hats nor <lb/>
bonnets, to hear the message Miss Edis seemed <lb/>
chosen to deliver.</p>
<p>At last the cottage was found too small to <lb/>
hold all that came to hear; so a local body of <lb/>
Congregationalists, recognising the good work <lb/>
she was doing, allowed her the use of a large <lb/>
schoolroom. But even this was soon very much <lb/>
<pb n="189" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0213"/>
overcrowded, and the young girl, in her enthusiasm, <lb/>
decided to take a Public Hall.</p>
<p>Her family, while rejoicing in her usefulness, <lb/>
feared the strain upon her health, and urged the <lb/>
girl not to undertake so great a responsibility. <lb/>
The bishop of the diocese interfered; but neither <lb/>
the pleadings of her friends nor the veto of the <lb/>
bishop had any weight with her.</p>
<p>Miss Edis told the bishop that if her meetings <lb/>
disturbed, as he said, the ordinary routine of <lb/>
Church work, she would sever her connection with <lb/>
the Church; but give up her work she could not, <lb/>
for she felt called upon by God to preach His <lb/>
Gospel to the people.</p>
<p>The bishop was so impressed by the evident <lb/>
conviction and earnestness of the girl-evangelist, <lb/>
that he withdrew his opposition and asked God's <lb/>
blessing upon her endeavours.</p>
<p>In time she became the wife of the Reverend <lb/>
G. S. Reaney, of Wycliffe Chapel, Warrington, <lb/>
but this made no difference in her work. She <lb/>
soon made her influence felt among the rough <lb/>
iron-workers of that town, not by going among <lb/>
them with an assumption of piety, but by talking <lb/>
to them in the easy, friendly manner which had <lb/>
won a hearing for her for so many years in her <lb/>
native town. She took an interest in their work, <lb/>
in their homes, in their families; and they learned <lb/>
to regard her as a real friend, to whose words it <lb/>
was a pleasure to listen.</p>
<p>One day she stopped a working-man and asked <lb/>
him to come to her meeting, when he surprised <lb/>
her by saying, "How much is there to pay?"</p>
<pb n="190" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0214"/>
<p>"Oh, nothing to pay!" she replied.</p>
<p>"Well, then, ma'am," replied the man, "if <lb/>
I were you I'd have a box at the door, for we <lb/>
working-men don't want our religion cheaper than <lb/>
we get our bread."</p>
<p>The suggestion was acted upon during the <lb/>
remainder of her stay in Warrington, where, for <lb/>
four years, she preached in the Public Hall every <lb/>
Sunday afternoon to crowded audiences.</p>
<p>On leaving the north, Mr. and Mrs. Reaney <lb/>
worked for six years in Reading, always with <lb/>
the same success; afterwards taking up duties at <lb/>
Stepney, in the east end of London. During <lb/>
their stay in this, the most thickly populated <lb/>
district of that part of the city, Mrs. Reaney's <lb/>
efforts among the people met with very gratifying <lb/>
results. She visited them in their homes, and, <lb/>
by her simple eloquence, drew them in large <lb/>
numbers to her services.</p>
<p>Her power over the roughest of the men was <lb/>
indeed wonderful; they seemed almost bound to <lb/>
yield to the charm of her voice and manner. They <lb/>
found in her a woman who was more friend than <lb/>
preacher&mdash;one who, by her great tact, drew them <lb/>
as willing listeners, to hear words at which they <lb/>
hitherto had but only scoffed and jeered. She <lb/>
taught them while but seeming to chat with them, <lb/>
and her words lingered with them, until they <lb/>
positively looked forward with pleasure to hearing <lb/>
her.</p>
<p>The box, suggested by the Lancashire man, was <lb/>
placed at the door of the hall, and in time produced <lb/>
a goodly sum of money. This Mrs. Reaney took <lb/>
<pb n="191" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0215"/>
care of, for she had a scheme in her mind which <lb/>
she hoped some day to carry out. Her constant <lb/>
intercourse with the people in their homes enabled <lb/>
her to understand their sufferings, and her warm <lb/>
heart longed to help them to see a little of the <lb/>
brighter side of life.</p>
<p>To them the year brought no change; week in <lb/>
and week out, it was nothing but work, when work <lb/>
was to be had, and suffering when it was scarce. <lb/>
Fathers and mothers struggled bravely on, in spite <lb/>
of ill-health and unwholesome surroundings, to <lb/>
rear their young and often sickly children, with <lb/>
never a sight of a green field or a breath of the <lb/>
free wind of the ocean.</p>
<p>Hard-working people were often turned out of <lb/>
their little homes, because, for a time, no money <lb/>
was forthcoming for the rent, while those with <lb/>
children found the greatest difficulty in procuring <lb/>
even temporary shelter till better times came again.</p>
<p>To remedy all this was Mrs. Reaney's one desire. <lb/>
With the money she had in hand, she therefore <lb/>
established a Convalescent Home at Folkestone, <lb/>
for the benefit of the poor of London; and a <lb/>
Rescue Home, in which families might take refuge <lb/>
in times of trouble, until some permanent relief <lb/>
could be afforded them, or they were themselves <lb/>
able to see a way out of their difficulties.</p>
<p>Her great aim in establishing these places was <lb/>
to make them homes in the truest sense: places <lb/>
where they would be sure of sympathy, comfort, <lb/>
and the tenderest care.</p>
<p>In 1888 Mrs. Reaney relinquished the <reg orig="manage-|ment">management</reg> <lb/>
of the Home at Folkestone and set about <lb/>
<pb n="192" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0216"/>
founding a similar one at Blackpool, for the <lb/>
working people of Warrington and the north <lb/>
generally. A small sum is paid by most of <lb/>
those who take advantage of these places; but <lb/>
any working people can be received absolutely <lb/>
free, if they have no means wherewith to pay.</p>
<p>The Home at Folkestone alone was the means <lb/>
of restoring eighteen hundred persons to health <lb/>
and strength, in the short space of four and a <lb/>
half years, and the people have the gratification <lb/>
of knowing that these places were erected out of <lb/>
their own contributions.</p>
<p>To one working, as did Mrs. Reaney, amongst <lb/>
the very poor of large cities, the evils of drink <lb/>
were abundantly obvious. To see an evil and <lb/>
not to remedy it was against her creed, so that <lb/>
Mrs. Reaney has ever been a steadfast worker in <lb/>
the cause of temperance.</p>
<p>On taking up residence in Greenwich, she leased <lb/>
for a period of three years a temperance <reg orig="coffee-|house">coffeehouse</reg>, <lb/>
with hall for various meetings, and laundry <lb/>
in which from twenty to thirty women were <reg orig="em-|ployed">employed</reg>, <lb/>
hoping thereby to do much good among <lb/>
the large population of her husband's parish.</p>
<p>Unhappily her expectations were not fulfilled, <lb/>
for having discovered some gross irregularities in <lb/>
the management, she was glad to give it up on <lb/>
the expiry of her lease. The experiment was not <lb/>
without value, however, for Mrs. Reaney learned <lb/>
much in many ways during the three years that <lb/>
was of profit to her in her future work.</p>
<p>Happy home-life has ever had great attractions <lb/>
for this good woman, and, in her journeyings in <lb/>
<pb n="193" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0217"/>
and around London, she was much struck with the <lb/>
fact that the men who pass their lives in driving <lb/>
and conducting tramcars and omnibuses in that <lb/>
and other large towns, could not possibly know <lb/>
anything of these joys. They rise and leave home <lb/>
before their families are up, and often do not <lb/>
return until after they are in bed again.</p>
<p>Now Mrs. Reaney, having given the matter due <lb/>
consideration, could not see that such a state of <lb/>
things was necessary. Why these men should be <lb/>
obliged to work all the hours of the day except <lb/>
those spent in recruiting their energies for further <lb/>
toil, she failed to understand. There was no justice <lb/>
in such an arrangement, and she worked with <lb/>
might and main to make their employers see this.</p>
<p>At last, not seeing any other way out of the <lb/>
difficulty, she took shares in one or two <reg orig="metro-|politan">metropolitan</reg> <lb/>
companies, so that she might personally <lb/>
urge the directors to make some alteration.</p>
<p>She wrote an article, to which was given the <lb/>
title of "Slave-driving by Public Companies," <lb/>
and sent it to the <hi rend="italic">Contemporary Review.</hi> She <lb/>
tried to talk a Member of Parliament into <reg orig="bring-|ing">bringing</reg> <lb/>
the question before the House of Commons. <lb/>
Lord Rosebery took up the cause, but all to no <lb/>
purpose; from fifteen to eighteen hours' work a <lb/>
day was still exacted from the long-suffering <lb/>
men.</p>
<p>One day, however, Mrs. Reaney resolved to <lb/>
make herself heard at a meeting of directors; <lb/>
so she persevered in spite of unmanly efforts <lb/>
to drown her voice. Finding that she was not <lb/>
to be put down, one of them remarked, "Hear <lb/>
<pb n="194" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0218"/>
her out, gentlemen; it is the shortest way to <lb/>
the end!" But, alas! all her energy enlisted <lb/>
but the sympathy of six of the seventy members <lb/>
present.</p>
<p>Mrs. Reaney had, however, succeeded in making <lb/>
the men's grievance public. The subject was <lb/>
taken up and discussed in several large towns <lb/>
both at home and in Australia, and she had the <lb/>
happiness of seeing her labours crowned by some <lb/>
measure of success.</p>
<p>Since the death of her husband, Mrs. Reaney <lb/>
has devoted herself to her Sunday afternoon <reg orig="meet-|ings">meetings</reg>, <lb/>
and other services during the week nights, <lb/>
as well as to temperance work and missions.</p>
<p>Her pen is never idle, for the joy of service <lb/>
&mdash;as she herself so happily phrases it, however <lb/>
that service is required&mdash;still inspires her. She <lb/>
writes, "My ideals grow higher as I live longer, <lb/>
and my belief in privilege and possibility <reg orig="associ-|ated">associated</reg> <lb/>
with a life surrender to God;" and her most <lb/>
earnest desire throughout her life has been to <lb/>
fully realise and testify to the truth of the text: <lb/>
"Oh, taste and see that the Lord is good. <lb/>
Blessed is the man that trusteth in Him."</p>

<head><hi rend="bold">MARY ANN ROGERS, <lb/>
HEROINE OF THE <hi rend="italic">STELLA</hi></hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Many</hi> and thrilling are the stories that have <lb/>
from time to time been told of the heroism of <lb/>
those who go down to the sea in ships; but <lb/>
few have been records of brave deeds performed by <lb/>
women. In the brief sketch here given of Mary <lb/>
Ann Rogers such a record will, however, be found.</p>
<p>Early in life she became the wife of a sailor, who, <lb/>
unfortunately, was lost at sea not long afterwards, <lb/>
leaving her with two very young children to rear <lb/>
and educate. Mrs. Rogers had now to face the <lb/>
question of ways and means, and the best way <lb/>
that occurred to her was to take a situation as <lb/>
stewardess on a boat. Through the influence of <lb/>
some friends she obtained such an appointment <lb/>
on one of the steamers regularly plying between <lb/>
Southampton and the Channel Islands.</p>
<p>So, for many years, Mrs. Rogers was a familiar <lb/>
figure to the regular passengers on these boats, <lb/>
and no kinder-hearted or more attentive stewardess <lb/>
could have been desired. Not only did she minister <lb/>
to the sick; her cheery face and hopeful words <lb/>
comforted everyone in her charge. None knew <lb/>
better than she the eerie fearsomeness which fills <lb/>
the minds of many passengers, who, while quite <lb/>
unaffected by the motion of the boat, cannot sleep <lb/>
for the dread of what might happen.</p>
<p>As the boat plunges through the waters, their <lb/>
rushing plainly seen through the fast-closed port <lb/>
<pb n="196" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0220"/>
holes, the monotonous throbbing of the engine, the <lb/>
dim light of the cabin, the profound silence become <lb/>
a very nightmare to the nervous, wakeful passenger, <lb/>
and to such the kind, motherly face of Mrs. Rogers <lb/>
brought peace. The air of quiet homeliness with <lb/>
which her presence filled the cabin gave them <lb/>
courage to pass the long hours with easier minds.</p>
<p>In view of the approaching Easter holidays, the <lb/>
London &amp; South Western Steam Packet Company <lb/>
advertised a special day trip, on Thursday, 30th <lb/>
March 1899, to the Channel Islands, by the <lb/>
S.S. <hi rend="italic">Stella</hi>. This was the boat to which Mrs. <lb/>
Rogers had been attached as first-class stewardess <lb/>
for nine years.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Stella</hi> carried a goodly number of <reg orig="pleasure-|seekers">pleasure-seekers</reg>, <lb/>
and, despite a thick mist, made a good <lb/>
run down the Solent and some distance across <lb/>
the Channel. Many of the nervous passengers <lb/>
were beginning to feel that the worst was over. <lb/>
True, the fog grew denser, but Captain Reeks <lb/>
was a man to be relied on. He had made the <lb/>
passage so many times that every inch of it was, <lb/>
so to speak, known to him. The passengers and <lb/>
crew trusted him as we trust ourselves to those <lb/>
who know the way on a strange road in the dark.</p>
<p>By some mischance, however, the vessel was <lb/>
carried eastward, out of her course, and not till <lb/>
she struck "with a shivering shock" did the <lb/>
captain realise this. No bell had warned them <lb/>
of their peril; no friendly light flashed a hint of <lb/>
pending disaster; the treacherous fog, luring the <lb/>
vessel to her doom, had baffled the efforts of <lb/>
warning bell and flashing light, and the <hi rend="italic">Stella</hi> <lb/>
<pb n="197" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0221"/>
ran full upon a group of granite rocks known as <lb/>
the "Casquets," lying to the north of Guernsey.</p>
<p>Instantly the captain knew what had happened. <lb/>
Clear through the gathering gloom his voice rang, <lb/>
"Stand by the boats!" and the seamen responded <lb/>
with strong, willing hands. No panic seized them, <lb/>
nor selfish thought; true to the best instincts of the <lb/>
British sailor&mdash;duty first&mdash;self last was their motto; <lb/>
and in the seven or eight minutes between the <lb/>
striking and sinking of the ship, they did all that <lb/>
was possible for the terrified passengers.</p>
<p>Boats were lowered, life-belts distributed, women <lb/>
and children brought forward and placed in the <lb/>
boats. Many an act of heroism passed unnoticed <lb/>
during that short interval; but one noble deed will <lb/>
live in the memory of all, and, when the roll of <lb/>
the truly great is called, the name of Mary Ann <lb/>
Rogers will be heard again.</p>
<p>In the ladies' cabin, that noble woman set an <lb/>
example of calm courage, seldom if ever <reg orig="sur-|passed">surpassed</reg>. <lb/>
Full well she realised what had happened; <lb/>
full well she recognised the fact that in all <reg orig="proba-|bility">probability</reg> <lb/>
she would never again see her loved ones <lb/>
at home; yet, with rapid but reassuring action <lb/>
she provided each woman with a life-belt, tying <lb/>
it securely on her whose trembling fingers refused <lb/>
the task, and sending her on deck.</p>
<p>Thinking all had left the cabin, she fastened a <lb/>
belt upon herself and was about to leave when she <lb/>
remembered a young woman had been sleeping <lb/>
in an inner berth. On returning to fetch her, she <lb/>
was met by the poor frightened creature. Quick <lb/>
as thought she tied a belt on her and hurried <lb/>
<pb n="198" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0222"/>
her out on deck, when another terrified young <lb/>
woman rushed up. Mrs. Rogers wasted no time <lb/>
in seeking another belt, but, calmly untying her <lb/>
own, she secured it to the shrinking figure before <lb/>
her, and had her passed down to the waiting <lb/>
boat.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Stella</hi> was now surely settling in her watery <lb/>
grave; the waiting boat was in imminent danger <lb/>
of being sucked down with it, yet the stewardess <lb/>
made no effort to save herself.</p>
<p>"Come on, Mrs. Rogers, quick!" cried the <lb/>
men.</p>
<p>"No, no," she replied, "save yourselves! <lb/>
There's no room for another! Good-bye!" and <lb/>
as the men at last reluctantly obeyed, she cried <lb/>
yet again, "Good-bye," then kneeling upon the <lb/>
deck of the doomed ship, she raised her hands <lb/>
in prayer.</p>
<p>This was the last that was seen of the brave <lb/>
woman, for, scarcely had the boat cleared off than <lb/>
the <hi rend="italic">Stella</hi> disappeared, carrying all that remained <lb/>
on board down to the ocean bed, where, alas! <lb/>
many of them shall sleep till "the sea gives up <lb/>
its dead."</p>
<p>The story of the heroic deed of Mary Ann Rogers <lb/>
was the only ray of light in the gloom which the <lb/>
sad disaster cast over the whole country, and it <lb/>
was decided to erect some memorial of the brave <lb/>
woman in the town to which she belonged.</p>
<p>The subscription list was started by Miss Frances <lb/>
Power Cobbe, and the necessary funds were soon <lb/>
in hand. A very handsome drinking fountain was <lb/>
placed on the new sea front, near the Southampton <lb/>

Pier, and upon it the story of her self-sacrifice is <lb/>
thus recorded:&mdash; <lb/>
<q>In memory of the <lb/>
Heroic Death <lb/>
of <lb/>
<hi rend="bold">MARY ANN ROGERS,</hi></q>
<q>Stewardess of the <hi rend="italic">Stella</hi>, <lb/>
who, on the night of 30th of March, 1899, <lb/>
amid the confusion and terror of shipwreck, aided <lb/>
all the women under her charge to quit the vessel in safety <lb/>
giving her own life-belt to one who was unprotected.</q>
<q>Urged by the sailors to make sure her own safety, <lb/>
she refused lest she might endanger the heavily-laden boat <lb/>
cheering the departing crew with the friendly cry of <lb/>
"Good-bye, good-bye!" She was seen a few <lb/>
minutes later as the <hi rend="italic">Stella</hi> went down, lifting her arms <lb/>
upwards with the prayer "Lord, have me." She <lb/>
sank in the waters with the sinking ship.</q></p>
<p>Actions such as these, revealing steadfast <reg orig="per-|formance">performance</reg> <lb/>
of duty in the face of death, ready <reg orig="self-|sacrifice">self-sacrifice</reg> <lb/>
for the sake of others, reliance on God, <lb/>
constitute the glorious heritage of our English <lb/>

nobility and love-worthiness of human nature.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Miss frances power cobbe</hi> was born <lb/>
in Dublin, 4th December, 1822. Her father, <lb/>
Charles Cobbe, Esq., of Newbridge House, <lb/>
Dublin, married the sister of Adjutant-General <lb/>
Conway, well known <lb/>
in Anglo-Indian <lb/>
circles. She was the <lb/>
only girl of six <lb/>
children, bright, <lb/>
happy, and healthy, <lb/>
though strong-willed <lb/>
and difficult to <lb/>
manage at times. <lb/>
The first half of her <lb/>
life was spent in <lb/>
her lovely home in <lb/>
Ireland, except for some few years' residence in <lb/>
England, where she was educated.</p>
<figure id="f17" rend="inline" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0226"/>
<p>Being a shrewd, capable child, learning was <lb/>
no trouble to her; and, before reaching her teens, <lb/>
she had studied some books whose names even are <lb/>
unknown to many grown-up people.</p>
<p>She took a great delight in astronomy, and the <lb/>
arrival of the comet of 1835 was discovered by <lb/>
her before any one else in the family realised it. <lb/>
She told her father she was sure it was the expected <lb/>
comet, as it had a long tail of light behind it.</p>
<pb n="201" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0227"/>
<p>Little Frances Cobbe was very unlike most <lb/>
small girls, for she simply detested fine clothes. <lb/>
She tells with great relish how she was once <lb/>
dressed in a sky-blue silk pelisse, the gift of her <lb/>
grandmother, and how she took the first favourable <lb/>
opportunity to roll in the mud and spoil it, so <lb/>
that she might be allowed to wear a plain cloth <lb/>
coat, of which she was very fond.</p>
<p>Sunny-tempered, self-reliant, and fond of <lb/>
animals, Frances Cobbe developed into a woman <lb/>
of strongly-marked character. Suffering always <lb/>
appealed to her, and as she obtained more <reg orig="experi-|ence">experience</reg> <lb/>
of men, and the treatment of women and <lb/>
animals by certain of them, she determined to <lb/>
use both her pen and her personal influence in <lb/>
remedying the evils that most repelled her.</p>
<p>For a time, however, she was unable to carry <lb/>
out her intentions, and the first real step toward <lb/>
freeing herself from the old-time traditions of <lb/>
woman's sphere in life, was an eleven months' <lb/>
tour through Europe, Egypt, and the Holy Land.</p>
<p>Shortly after her return she went to reside with <lb/>
Miss Carpenter in the Red Lodge House, to be <lb/>
company for her in her home and a help to her <lb/>
in her Reformatory and Ragged School work. <lb/>
Miss Cobbe had become acquainted with Miss <lb/>
Carpenter's labours through Lady Byron, who, <lb/>
though a confirmed invalid, was never so happy <lb/>
as when doing something for her friends.</p>
<p>It was not, however, until after her arrival at <lb/>
the Red Lodge House that Miss Cobbe actually <lb/>
met Miss Carpenter, and this is how she writes <lb/>
of her:&mdash;</p>
<pb n="202" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0228"/>
<p>"There was humour in every line of her face, <lb/>
and a readiness to catch the first gleam of a <lb/>
joke. But the prevailing characteristic of Mary <lb/>
Carpenter was a high and strong <hi rend="italic">Resolution,</hi> <lb/>
which made her whole path much like that of <lb/>
a plough in a well-drawn furrow, which goes <lb/>
straight on its own beneficent way, and gently <lb/>
pushes aside into little ridges all intervening <lb/>
people and things."</p>
<p>Speaking of her work at the Red Lodge, Miss <lb/>
Cobbe says: "We assembled for prayers very <lb/>
early in the morning, and breakfast was got over, <lb/>
during the winter months, before daylight. After <lb/>
this there were classes at the different schools, <reg orig="end-|less">endless</reg> <lb/>
arrangements and organisations, the looking <lb/>
up of little truants from the Ragged Schools, and a <lb/>
good deal of business in the way of writing reports, <lb/>
and so on. Altogether, nearly every hour of the <lb/>
day and week was pretty well mapped out, leaving <lb/>
only space for the brief dinner and tea."</p>
<p>She remained there for about a year, when, her <lb/>
health not being good, she was obliged to take a <lb/>
house in Clifton, where she resided for some time, <lb/>
still continuing her interest in Miss Carpenter's <lb/>
many undertakings.</p>
<p>Miss Cobbe's pen was never idle; morals, <reg orig="reli-|gious">religious</reg> <lb/>
duty, social questions, the rights, duties, and <lb/>
work of women, all were ably treated of in the <lb/>
many books she published from time to time. <lb/>
Her own education had been liberal, and it was <lb/>
much widened by recent travels. She had been <lb/>
reared among numerous brothers and boy cousins, <lb/>
and so had escaped much of the narrowness <lb/>
<pb n="203" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0229"/>
from which so many of the young girls of that <lb/>
day suffered. Miss Cobbe therefore felt great <lb/>
sympathy for the generality of women, whose <lb/>
lives, bounded by their immediate home circle, <lb/>
were utterly devoid of any interest beyond. She <lb/>
saw in them the victims of long-established <lb/>
tradition; so she resolved to work her hardest to <lb/>
destroy it.</p>
<p>While quite admitting that woman's place is <lb/>
at home, Miss Cobbe argued that she would be <lb/>
much more useful even there if her mind were <lb/>
broadened by more freedom of education and <lb/>
thought. She therefore wrote a pamphlet on <lb/>
"Female Education," in which she strongly urged <lb/>
the right of women to obtain University degrees.</p>
<p>Not content with wielding the pen on behalf of <lb/>
her sex, she mounted the public platform and <lb/>
lectured most forcefully on the subject of Woman <lb/>
&mdash;her duties, her rights, her advancement. It <lb/>
seems utterly absurd to her that a well-educated, <lb/>
sensible shrewd woman is not considered capable <lb/>
of judging as to the fitness of certain men to <lb/>
represent women in Parliament, while a totally <reg orig="un-|educated">uneducated</reg> <lb/>
fellow, with possibly not more than <lb/>
sufficient brains to carry him through life as a <lb/>
labourer, is given the vote denied to her, simply <lb/>
because he is a man.</p>
<p>This being so, she has striven with pen and <lb/>
argument to bring home the absurdity to the <lb/>
minds of our legislators. Florence Nightingale, <lb/>
Mary Carpenter, Elizabeth Fry, and other notable <lb/>
women mentioned in this book, have all held the <lb/>
same opinions, and have done their best toward <lb/>
<pb n="204" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0230"/>
obtaining for women the right to a voice in the <lb/>
government of the country.</p>
<p>From observation and reading Miss Cobbe <lb/>
became aware of another wrong suffered by many <lb/>
thousands of women in our country. This was <lb/>
the pitiful fact that a woman, having unfortunately <lb/>
married a man of brutal nature, was obliged to <lb/>
continue living with him, and suffering from his <lb/>
ill-treatment. To right this grievous wrong Miss <lb/>
Cobbe laboured long and earnestly, and an Act <lb/>
was passed in 1878, by which a wife could claim <lb/>
separation from a husband who was convicted of <lb/>
continuous ill-treatment.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Miss cobbe's</hi> great love for animals now led <lb/>
her to strenuous efforts on their behalf. She <lb/>
saw, with dismay, that the practice of <reg orig="operat-|ing">operating</reg> <lb/>
upon living animals, in the pursuit of medical <lb/>
science, was growing rapidly. The tortures <reg orig="en-|dured">endured</reg> <lb/>

persons, repelled by the cruel practice, <lb/>
banded themselves into societies for its <reg orig="suppres-|sion">suppression</reg>, <lb/>
and of one of these, the Victoria Street <lb/>
Society for the Protection of Animals from <reg orig="Vivi-|section">Vivisection</reg>, <lb/>
Miss Cobbe was Honorary Secretary for <lb/>
fifteen years. She has also written over one <lb/>
hundred leaflets and pamphlets on the subject.</p>
<p>Her love for animals, too, led her to accept the <lb/>
<pb n="205" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0231"/>
editorship of a paper called the <hi rend="italic">Zoophilist,</hi> and for <lb/>
years she may have been seen trudging backwards <lb/>
and forwards to her office, three or four days <lb/>
every week.</p>
<p>She was practically the first to bring home to <lb/>
us the fact that dumb creatures have their rights <lb/>
as well as ourselves, and to point out to us that <lb/>
we have certain duties to perform towards these, <lb/>
our fellow-beings, even though they be on a lower <lb/>
level than ourselves.</p>
<p>On 22nd December, 1902, she received a <reg orig="hand-|some">handsome</reg> <lb/>
album, containing an address congratulating <lb/>
her on the attainment of her eightieth birthday, and <lb/>
on the high moral purpose of her life. This address <lb/>
contains the names of over three hundred persons <lb/>
well known in all progressive movements both <lb/>
in Britain and in America. Two Anti-Vivisection <lb/>
Societies also sent congratulations, as well as the <lb/>
Ragged School Union and the Central Committee <lb/>
for Women's Suffrage, London.</p>
<p>The last years of her life were spent at a <lb/>
beautiful spot at Dolgelly, North Wales, where, <lb/>
while still employed in the furtherance of her <lb/>
favourite aims&mdash;the advancement of women, and <lb/>
the protection of animal life&mdash;she died early in <lb/>
April, 1904.</p>
<p>Not long before her death, a book written in <lb/>
Tamil, the language of Southern India, and <reg orig="in-|tended">intended</reg> <lb/>
to stimulate the Hindu women to emulate <lb/>
the example of some of their British sisters, was <lb/>
sent to Miss Cobbe from Madras. It is called <lb/>
"The Lives of True and Good Englishwomen of <lb/>
the Victorian Age," and includes most of the <lb/>
<pb n="206" entity="Cochrane_PeerlessWomen_0232"/>
names found in this volume. Some day it may <lb/>
be possible to obtain a translation of the work, <lb/>
when it is certain no one of us will read it without <lb/>
failing to be proud of such women as Miss Cobbe, <lb/>
and the other workers therein mentioned.</p>
<p>They are the daughters of the Empire: they <lb/>
fought strenuously and won gloriously in many <lb/>
a stern battle against sin and neglect and <reg orig="op-|pression">oppression</reg>. <lb/>
No repulse daunted them. Let their <lb/>
opponents entrench themselves howsoever strongly, <lb/>
they doggedly renewed their attacks until victory <lb/>
crowned their efforts. They showed the world that <lb/>
British women have just the same staying power, <lb/>
just the same capacity for overcoming difficulties, <lb/>
just the same inability to recognise defeat, as the <lb/>
men who have won for our country the proud <lb/>
position it holds to-day.</p>
<p>And if these brief sketches of their heroic <lb/>
efforts move us to follow their example, we shall, <lb/>
like them, leave the world a little better than we <lb/>
found it.</p>

labourers are few."</p>

the most exciting work of fiction. "Peerless Women" contains sketches of <reg orig="large-|hearted">largehearted</reg> <lb/>
women, whose names are known throughout the Empire. "In the Icy <lb/>
North" tells in simple language the stories of Franklin and Nansen; while the "Two <lb/>
Old Sea Dogs" are Drake and Blake, beloved by our manly youth. "Missionary <lb/>
Pioneers"&mdash;the intensely interesting biographies of Moffat, Livingstone, Carey, <lb/>
Brainerd, and others. "Two Modern Travellers" are the lately deceased Mrs. <lb/>
Bishop and Sir Henry Stanley, whose stirring and adventurous careers will appeal <lb/>
very strongly to the youth of to-day.</q>
