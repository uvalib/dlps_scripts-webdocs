                    </bibl>
                </head>
                <p>Charles writes to Addie from camp in Culpepper Court House, Virginia, of his
                    regiment's busy preparations and, thanks to Addie's letters, his peaceable state
                    of mind. He reports that he has formally asked Addie's father for her hand in
                    marriage, and enthusiastically quotes her his positive reply (though with the
                    caveat "unless that I shall learn of some dishonor attached to you, or her"). He
                    apologizes to "his Queen" for making the request without telling her in advance.
                    Changing the subject, Charles goes on to defend McClellan's tactics, stating
                    that he has recovered from a momentary disappointment in the General, and
                    predicts that England will not intervene on the Confederate side because of the
                    fact of a bad grain crop, along with the threat of Irish and Canadian rebellion
                    and French retaliation. Charles avers that he is prepared to give his life for
                    the cause of Union, but with Addie's prayers on his side, God shall protect him.
                    He praises Addie for firmly disciplining Miss Lizzie. In closing Charles
                    recounts a dream wherein he feels a "soft, warm hand upon his brow", enters a
                    curtained chamber, and shares a passionate embrace and kiss with his beloved.
                    The romantic scene ends in slapstick when Charles wakes suddenly, treading on a
                    comrade's toes, with a "great big bug [falling] upon my nose." "I feel that
                    loving kiss still -- so warm and genial," he writes. "Wasn't it a funny dream?"
                    He says he has enclosed a flower he picked on the battlefield.</p>

                <p>I have been cogitating this morning on<orig reg="various">vari-<lb/>ous</orig>
                    subjects, but invariably my thoughts revert<lb/>to<name type="place"

                    my affections. When I<orig reg="received">recieved</orig><lb/>your darling
                    letters just after the battle, my<lb/>heart was inexpressibly lightened, and I
                    felt more<lb/><pb n="2" entity="DSSR_000000766_0606"/> like enduring the
                    hardships which I knew would<lb/>inevitably ensue, but I confess they were
                    lighter --<lb/>or at least they seemed so to me -- than we all<lb/>expected. But
                    I will not dwell on this.<lb/></p>
                <p>While we were at<name type="place">Alexandria</name>, I wrote a<lb/>letter to
                        your<name type="person">Papa</name>, asking his consent to our<lb/>union at

                <p>He says &ldquo;If it is your and<name type="person">Addie</name>'s wish to

                    like that? Do you wonder, my own,<lb/>why I took such a course without

                    make the first allusion to this,<lb/>but I feel an anxiety to know the time
                    when<lb/>you will be all mine. But of course there is<lb/>the uncertainty of the

                    mine, if I have<lb/>made an ill timed allusion, and I will offend<lb/>no

                <p>You ask my opinion of<name type="person">McClellan</name> and his<lb/>movements.
                    Really that is a very difficult<del hand="h1">y</del> question<lb/>to answer;

                    feel assured that it is no fault of<lb/>his. Only look at the disadvantages
                    under which<lb/>he has labored. He had a magnificent army when<lb/>he landed

                    an assault, and carried up<lb/>his advantage until he reached the very face and
                    front<lb/>of the most formidable defences of modern times, and<lb/>requested
                    reinforcements. These were denied him (until<lb/>too<orig reg="late"
