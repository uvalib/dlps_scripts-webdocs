                <head type="main">PRESIDENT'S REPORT</head>
               <p>The President began his customary remarks with a report on
                    AccessUVA </p>
               <p> The program, he said, has been a tremendous success in its first
                    full year of implementation. The current number of admitted students who qualify
                    for full grants under AccessUVA is 193, and the number continues to grow. A year
                    ago, by comparison, 70 students were fully funded. He noted that the value of a
                    fully funded year of education is <pb n="6895"/> $16,500 for in-state students
                    and $34,500 for out-of-state students. </p>
               <p> As a result of AccessUVA, 7% of the incoming class will be from
                    low-income backgrounds. That figure is lower than we would like, he said, and
                    the newly organized AccessUVA steering committee is developing strategies to
                    increase that number. </p>
               <p> The President thanked the steering committee: <name>Ms. Yvonne
                        Hubbard</name> (Student Financial Services), <name>Mr. Blackburn</name>
                    (Admissions), <name>Mr. Kimata</name> (University Comptroller) and <name>Ms.
                        Wood</name> (University Relations) for their work. He introduced
                        <name>Mesdames Hubbard and Wood</name> and <name>Mr. Kimata</name> to the
                    Board; <name>Mr. Blackburn</name> was out of town. </p>
               <p> The President also mentioned the Saturday Scholars Program, which
                    had been very successful before it was discontinued in the early 1990s; it is
                    planned to restart the Program in the Office of African American Affairs. The
                    program was an effort to prepare students for college by engaging them beginning
                    in middle school; an important component of the Program will be involvement by
                    the parents, family or guardians of the participants. </p>
               <p> The previous version of the Program, he said, was highly
                    successful with very high college graduation rates among its participants. </p>
               <p> The President reported that the University will present a
                    life-size bronze statue of <name>Thomas Jefferson</name> to The University of
                    Virginia's College at Wise. The statue, funded with private gifts, will
                    commemorate the 50th anniversary of the College and <name>Mr. Ern</name>'s
                    service as Chancellor; it will be dedicated in the fall. </p>
               <p> The President noted that he and <name>Mrs. Casteen</name> have
                    traveled across the country and abroad this spring to meet with alumni, parents
                    and friends of the University. Since January 1st, events have been held in some
                    27 cities. </p>
               <p> The Class of 1955, which had its 50th reunion several weeks ago,
                    broke all records with 40% of the class in attendance. There was an increase of
                    more than 300% in the number of alumni attending Black Alumni Weekend. In the
                    general reunions last weekend, four classes set records for reunion giving with
                    the Class of 1985 making the largest <pb n="6896"/> gift: $9.2million. The grand
                    total of reunion gifts was $27million. </p>

                   <p> The President reported that private giving to the University
                        and its related foundations, in the period <dateRange from="2004-07-01"
                            to="2005-04-30">July 1, 2004 - April 30, 2005</dateRange>, came to
                        $155.8million, an increase of 4% above the same period last year (but not
                        including the reunion gifts of $27million). </p>
                   <p> Among the significant gifts received since he last reported to
                        the Board, the President mentioned $5million to the College of Arts
                        &amp; Sciences from <name>Mrs. Hamilton Clay</name> of Charleston, West
                        Virginia and Vero Beach, Florida. There was an anonymous $1million
                        charitable remainder trust toward the Medical Education Building at the
                        School of Medicine. The <name>John H. Birdsall</name> Trust made a $500,000
                        pledge payment to the College Foundation for its unrestricted use, and
                            <name>Jeffrey C. Walker</name> of Wilton, Connecticut made a $333,000
                        pledge payment to the McIntire School of Commerce Foundation for McIntire's
                        building campaign. </p>
                   <p> The President mentioned several new pledges made since his
                        last report to the Board: an anonymous $5million pledge to the McIntire
                        School of Commerce Foundation for its building campaign; a $5million pledge
                        to the Medical School for the <name>Beirne B. Carter</name> Center for
                        Immunology Research from the <name>Beirne Carter</name> Foundation of
