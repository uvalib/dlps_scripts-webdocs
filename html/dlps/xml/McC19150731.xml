            One of our men is leaving
            to morrow on permission
            to see his brother who
            has been wounded and I
            am sending in this
            letter by him to be 
            mailed from Paris.  I
            have just received your
            letter of the 26th and
            thank you so much.
            </p><p>
            I believe I told you that 
            there are no ambulances at 
            all left now in Pont a 
            Mousson, tho [sic] the authorities
            are going to place one here

            in the near future.
            </p><p>
            We have had a reorganization
            and the section has been 
            split up.  Ten of us remain
            on the front in service
            every day and night and
            the remainder take care of
            the work below &mdash; and
            good news, Walter Lovell
            has been made a squad
            leader and is with us 
            up here.
            </p><p>
            Our bureau has been
            moved and we now occupy 
            a splendid estate just
            out of town and nearer
            our postes de secours.  The
            grounds are exquisite; I’d

            feel ashamed of myself 
            living in all this
            comfort out on the
            front were it not for
            the fact that someone
            would use it and if
            so we just as well
            take advantage of what 
            presents itself.  To add
            to the fortunate run of
            things I have been
            invited by Salisbury to
            live with him and I
            now am established in 
            the house of the exquisite
            grounds I wrote you
            about.  I have the dainty

            room of Mademoiselle
            which was relinquished
            by our Lieutenant Vullman. [sp?]
            Vullman showed up to night
            in an Elephant’s breath
            uniform.  He’s the “swankiest”
            embusque I’ve ever seen.
            Lives in Nancy with
            his women most of the 
            time.  One feels as if
            one should be dolled up
            the way he is while
            living in such quarters
            as we have.  I feel as
            if I contaminated the
            place in my streaked
            sloppy uniform.

            Glad to hear dear
            Mr. Allatin is enjoying
            himself.
            </p><p>
            Come now - I may have
            been bold in the ending 
            of the letter you refer to
            but I was telling you
            how I felt.  Sure it
            was impulse &mdash; now I
            don’t feel that way
            at all &mdash; there now
            that squares it and
            you’ll forgive me won’t
            you?
            </p><p>
            Please remember me 
            to Miss Lines when you
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0150" n="[p.6]"/>
            
            see her again.  Maybe
            she remembers me.  Just
            met her at a tea and
            saw her around the
            ambulance so maybe she
            doesn’t.
            </p><p>
            Waldo Pierce is going to
            join us in a few days.
            He’s the nut that
            started abroad with Jack
            Reed on a cattle ship
            and not liking the said
            ship jumped overboard
            beyond Boston light and
            broke a swimming record
            getting to shore.  Reed
            was held as his 
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0151" n="[p.7]"/>
            
            murderer and Pierce
            wandered into the
            British court room at
            the eleventh hour.
            </p><p>
            The old Boche that
            used to live in our 
            present bureau had bad
            taste in many ways but
            his tobacco, a jar of
            which I find on the 
            desk in front of me, 
            is rather good.  One
            reason this house hasn’t
            been shot up is because
            its Boche property I
            guess.  The only thing
            it has received are
            eclat marks.  We’ve got
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0152" n="[p.8]"/>
            
            a nice new shell now.
            Saw it being tried out
            with success.  Combination
            asphyxiating and incendiary.
            A battery fired them at
            a cluster of houses in the
            German lines the other day
            and in a short while things
            were burning.  Wish there
            was a shell that could be
            fired all the way to Berlin
            that would kill everyone
            there.
            </p><p>
            Good luck, and thanks
            again for your letter.
