                    Director for Compliance, conducted the session, the principal aim of which was
                    to inform Members of the strict NCAA rules governing the recruitment of athletes
                    and what role members of governing boards may play in the process. </p>

                    that <name>Ms. Enoch</name>’s infectious enthusiasm and her good work has been

                <p> The President noted that <name>Mr. Robert Harris</name>, Dean of
                    the Darden School, has announced that he will step down as Dean in June; a
                    search committee for a new Dean has been organized under the chairmanship of the
                    Provost. </p>
                <p>The University Press has issued its first electronic imprint, <hi
                        rend="italic">The Dolley Madison Digital Edition</hi>, which is
                    an edited collection of letters. It is being supported by the Mellon Foundation,

                <p>The President reported that he and <name>Mr. Sandridge</name> have
                    held two open meetings for faculty, staff, and students to discuss the Charter
                    legislation. More such meetings will held over the course of the semester. He
                    then commented on the legislation and various groups who support and oppose it,
                    as well as other legislation affecting the University that might come before the
                    General Assembly at this Session. </p>
                <p>The President discussed a recent racial incident in which a fourth
                    year student, a resident of the Lawn, found a racial epithet written on her car.
                    He described the University’s response to the incident and how matters of this
                    sort should and will be handled in the future. He emphasized that intolerance
                    has no place in the University and that if incidents of this sort occur again,
                    the University will respond quickly and firmly. </p>

                <p>The President noted first that private giving to the University and
                    its related foundations for Fiscal Year 2004, that is the year that ended on
                        <date value="2004-06-30">June 30, 2004</date>, amounted to $174.9million. If
                    the distribution last year from the estate of David Harrison is excluded, the
                    base rate of fund raising has increased by 13% over the last fiscal year. </p>
                <p>Turning to figures for the first two months of the current fiscal
                    year, that is, July 1-August 31, he reported that private giving is
                    $18.5million, which is a decrease of $2.4million or 12% from the same period
                    last year. Nonetheless, the College, the University Library and The University
                    of Virginia’s College at Wise report substantial increases in giving. </p>
                <p>Among significant gifts received since the June Board meeting are a
                    bequest of $2.32million to the College from the Estate of <name>Mrs. Frances M.
                        Burger</name> – the gift benefits the <name>Alfred and Frances Burger</name>
                    Endowed Fellowship Fund for Chemistry. The Pew Charitable Trust has made a
                    $1.5million grant to the College for the Center on Religion and Democracy. There
                    is a bequest of $1million for the <name>John C. Buchanan</name> Professorship in
                    Internal Medicine from the Estate of <name>Jean Lui Phipps</name>. A $1million
                    bequest from the Estate of <name>Paul F. Dishner, M.D.</name> is to be split
                    between The University of Virginia’s College at Wise and the School of
                    Continuing and Professional Studies center at Abingdon. </p>
                <p>Among significant new pledges in the same period is a $10million
                    pledge from <name>Mrs. Ann Lee Saunders Brown</name>, to be split between the
                    School of Engineering and the University Library – the <pb n="6736"/> President
                    reminded the Board that <name>Mrs. Brown</name> would be their guest at lunch
                    later in the day. Microsoft Corporation has made a $3million pledge to the
                    Darden School Foundation for a joint program between the Darden School and the
                    Curry School of Education for the Virginia School Turnaround Specialist Program.
                    The <name>Horace W. Goldsmith</name> Foundation has pledged $1.5million for the
                    endowment held by the Law School Foundation. Bristol-Myers Squibb Medical
                    Imaging, Inc. has made a pledge of $1million to the School of Medicine for the
                        <name>George A. Beller, M.D.</name>/Bristol-Myers Squibb Medical Imaging,
                    Inc., Professorship in Cardiovascular Medicine. The <name>John H.
                    Birdsall</name> Revocable Trust has pledged $1million to The College Foundation
                    for unrestricted use. </p>
                <p>The final pledge the President reported came from <name>Mr. Daniel
                        Maxwell Meyers</name> of Boston who announced last week that he intended to
                    double his pledge to the Curry School, bringing his total pledge to $22million;
                    this is thought to be the second largest gift ever made to an American school of
                    education. </p>

                            property; and </p>
                       
                        <p>WHEREAS, the North Grounds Connector is needed to
                            improve access to North Grounds facilities, and the University’s costs
                            associated with the transfer will be limited to closing costs, and will
                            be nominal; </p>

                          <p>RESOLVED FURTHER that the Executive Vice President and

                                    public services is dependent upon public confidence in its

                                <p>Whereas, the character of any organization is
                                    reflected not only by its aspirations and its standards but also
                                    by the ethics and behaviors of its leadership and staff; and </p>
                               
                                <p>Whereas, the General Assembly of Virginia has
                                    enacted a comprehensive code of ethics which both defines and
                                    prohibits inappropriate and illegal conflicts of interests
                                    applicable state- wide to all governmental officers and
                                    employees; and </p>
                            
                                <p>Whereas, the departments and schools of the
                                    University have likewise administratively enacted comprehensive
                                    personnel and procurement policies and procedures to promote
                                    objective fairness in their operations; and </p>
                               
                                <p>Whereas, in recognition of the fundamental
                                    importance of integrity in all that the University does and
                                    undertakes, the Board of Visitors hereby adopts the following
                                    ethical principles to govern, guide and inspire the University
                                    community to the highest standard of ethical behaviors. These
                                    principles do not replace existing standards of conduct or
                                    personnel policies, nor obviate appropriate attention to
                                    professional ethics as may be applicable in specific
                                    circumstances. </p>

                                    Virginia, the following principles are adopted applicable to all
