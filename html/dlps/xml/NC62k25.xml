    </head>
    <p>Charley apologizes for not writing, reassures Addie that he is in good health, and explains
     that he has been unusually busy with his clerical work. It is late at night and raining
     heavily; he wishes he could be with Addie, and asks whether she thinks he should request a
     discharge. He wishes he could have attended Laurie's wedding and hopes she will be happy. He
     has not received any letters from Hal, and has heard only from Addie about Hal's departure for
     Michigan. He comments on General McClellan's removal from the command of the Army of the
     Potomac and on his admirable qualities, and hopes that General Burnside will be more successful
     (while pointing out the circumstances that may prevent this). He asks for a description of
     Thanksgiving dinner and wishes Addie pleasant dreams and happiness.</p>

     <salute>My own loved <name type="person">Addie</name></salute> &mdash;<lb/>
    </opener>
    <p>Does my chirography look<lb/> familiar to you? or has it been so long since<lb/> you had the
     pleasure of seeing a specimen that<lb/> you fail? But I have just <orig reg="received"
     >recieved</orig> two<lb/> darling letters from you dated <abbr expan="November">Nov.</abbr> 9th
     &amp; 16th, in<lb/> both of which you complain of not <orig reg="receiving">recieving</orig>
     a<lb/> letter from <name type="person">&ldquo;Charley&rdquo;</name> for<q>two-three
      weeks.</q> I do<lb/> not wonder that you begin to feel alarmed about<lb/> him, but calm your
     fears my love, I am neither<lb/> dead nor changed, &amp; I am enjoying better health<lb/>
     than I have for three weeks past, and am<lb/> steadily gaining, so that I think there is
     no<lb/> immediate danger of my demise nor consignment<lb/> to the Hospital.&mdash; I must
     apologize for not<lb/> writing within the past week as I promised<lb/> to do.&mdash; We
     have changed the <abbr expan="Provost">Pro</abbr> Marshal, and<lb/> with the change came a great
     deal of work for<lb/>
     <hi rend="underline">&ldquo;us four clerks&rdquo;,</hi> and we have had to keep
     hard<lb/> at work from dawn of day until half past ten at night.<lb/>
     <pb n="2" entity="DSSR_000000766_0662"/>Thus you see but very little time for letter
      writing <add hand="h1" place="supralinear">remained for us</add>.<lb/> Will you not pardon me
     under the circumstances?<lb/>
    </p>
    <p>It is now ten at night, and the rain is falling<lb/> heavily&mdash; as it comes dashing
     down upon the<lb/> pavement, the sound awakens many thoughts<lb/> which might otherwise lie in
     the deep recesses of<lb/> the mind. No doubt but it <hi rend="underline">snows</hi> heavily
     upon<lb/> the <name type="place">&ldquo;Lake shore&rdquo;</name>, and you will soon
     enjoy all<lb/> the joyous pleasures of <hi rend="underline">&ldquo;Sleigh-riding.&rdquo;
      Would I<lb/> could be with you.</hi> Darling&mdash;how much&mdash;Oh!<lb/> how much I
     wish to see you, to fold thee to my<lb/> heart and gaze into those loving eyes&mdash;the
     windows<lb/> of thy noble soul&mdash;to hear thy gentle voice as <del hand="h1"
      rend="line-through">it</del> in<lb/> accents full of love and tenderne&longs;s, thou
      sayest <hi rend="underline">
      <q>I love<lb/> you.</q>
     </hi> But the plash of the rain falls upon my ear<lb/> and I am &ldquo;far
     away.&rdquo;&mdash;the pleasure is denied me.<lb/> and I still toil on&mdash;a
     soldier in the good cause.<lb/>
    </p>
    <p><name type="person">Addie</name>&mdash;what would you say if I were to<lb/> accept a
     discharge from the Army, and should<lb/> come home? Would you say<q>yes</q>, or would<lb/> you
     prefer that I should remain in the &ldquo;Noble <name type="regiment"
     >7th&rdquo;</name><lb/> until it comes home to <name type="place">Cleveland</name> with <del
      hand="h1" rend="line-through">in</del> the &ldquo;honors<lb/>
     <pb n="3" entity="DSSR_000000766_0663"/>of war&rdquo;, and as one of the 1040 who who
      left <name type="place">Cleveland</name> &ldquo;for<lb/> the war&rdquo;? Is it a funny
     question? But what<lb/> do <hi rend="underline">you</hi> say? Perhaps I might get discharged, if
     I<lb/> should desire it.<lb/>
    </p>
    <p>Yes, I would have given much to have<lb/> been present at <name type="person">Laurie</name>'s
      wedding. <hi rend="underline">God grant<lb/> she may be happy.</hi> Let us hope she may yet<lb/>
     <hi rend="underline">love as she lives,</hi> and the past may be forgotten.<lb/>
    </p>
    <p>You committed no act calling my pardon<lb/> in reading my note to <name type="person"
     >Hal</name>, and as to the &ldquo;question&rdquo;<lb/> as you will imagine, I have long
     since made<lb/> up my mind. The time for enlisting has<lb/> pas&longs;ed, and I am yet a <hi
      rend="underline">volunteer.</hi> Your<lb/> information regarding <name type="person"
     >Hal</name>'s going to <name type="place">
      <abbr expan="Michigan">Mich.</abbr>
     </name> was<lb/> the first I had <orig reg="received">recieved</orig>. I thought it <orig
      reg="somewhat">some-<lb/> what</orig> strange that I <orig reg="received">recieved</orig> no
     tidings from<lb/> him, but I hope soon to <orig reg="receive">recieve</orig> a letter.<lb/>
    </p>
    <p>Although <name type="person"><abbr expan="General">Gen.</abbr> McClellan</name> has been
     removed<lb/> I do not think his career is thus briefly ended.<lb/> The patient resignation and
     alacrity to obey even<lb/> such an unpleasant order, manifested by him<lb/> has gone very far
     to win himself many friends.<lb/>
     <pb n="4" entity="DSSR_000000766_0664"/> It is true that he sometimes was apparently
     inactive<lb/> but when a move was made, it was <hi rend="underline">well</hi> made<lb/> and, as
     you rema<del hand="h1" rend="overline">k</del>rked <add hand="h1" place="supralinear"><orig
       reg="Isn't">Isnt</orig>-that-pretty?</add>,<q>had it not been for the<lb/> politicians,</q>
     he would have silenced all<lb/> slanderers by succe&longs;s, where they by <hi
      rend="underline">their treason</hi><lb/> defeated <del hand="h1" rend="line-through">them</del>
     him. I do not think <name type="person"><abbr expan="General">Gen.</abbr><lb/> Burnside</name>
     has been as &ldquo;active&rdquo; as many prophesied<lb/> nor do I think he <hi
      rend="underline">will</hi> be soon, in point of<lb/> fact it is a difficult matter to move a
     body of<lb/> men as large as the <name type="army">Army of the Potomac</name>, much<lb/> more so
     than a few thousand such as <name type="person">&ldquo;Stonewall<lb/>
     Jackson</name>'s&rdquo; army. <orig reg="A">a</orig>nd people will find it so.<lb/> But at
     all events, &ldquo;Succe&longs;s to <name type="person"><abbr expan="General"
      >Gen.</abbr> Burnside</name>.&rdquo;<lb/>
    </p>
    <p>But it is getting quite late, and yet it<lb/> rains. We will have muddy roads tomorrow<lb/>
     Oh! do tell me all about Thanksgiving-dinner<lb/> and all. How I would enjoy a piece of<lb/>
     mince or pumpkin pie, but I must content<lb/> myself with <hi rend="underline">"Hard-tack,
     etc."</hi></p>
    
    <closer>I must now close<lb/> for tonight. Good night, <hi rend="underline">love,</hi>
     pleasant<lb/> dreams be thine, and happine&longs;s.<lb/> Write soon<lb/> to your own loving
     and true
