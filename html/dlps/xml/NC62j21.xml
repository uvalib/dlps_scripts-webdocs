                    </bibl>
                </head>

                <p>Charles has been feeling down but expresses a resolve to cheer up with the help
                    of "an hours conversation with my treasure", taking Addie's portrait as
                    surrogate interlocutor. One great source of sadness is Charles's family's,
                    especially his father's, apparent indifference to Charles's military service:
                    "no wishes for my success--no hopes for my return, but a cold shoulder, a cool
                    'no difference.'" Charles has been left behind as his regiment decamped--he is
                    under physician's orders to rest in order to overcome an unspecified ailment.
                    The regiment has moved to Hillsborough, and Charles suspects that McClellan
                    intends to hinder the enemy's movements in that area. After remembering a love
                    of Byron's poetry that he shares with Adelaide, he shifts his thoughts to
                    politics, rejoicing that "Vallandigheim" lost the recent election and regretting
                    the political maneuverings at the War Department that have hindered the Union's
                    war efforts. He then invites Adelaide to a word-tour of two hospitals where his
                    injured comrades receive treatment. Charles concludes by asking Adelaide to
                    dream of him, and to write often.</p>

                <p>I have had that most horrible of all<lb/> diseases
                    &ldquo;Hypochondria,&rdquo; and still feel a little

                    Why? Because I have just<lb/> recieved your darling letter of the 12<hi

                    into those loving eyes. There it is--lying upon my Bible, which<lb/> which is

                <p>Are you well, my love? No answer,--yet that same<lb/> quiet smiles bids me good
                    cheer. "Why art thou cast down<lb/> O my soul? Why art thou disquieted within
                    me?" " <hi rend="underline">Hope thou<lb/> in God</hi>." Yes, I will hope in God,
                    and He shall preserve<lb/>

                    >indeed</hi> am<lb/> I, my heart is lighter by far. But I fear I have
                    written<lb/> much that is uninteresting, if not painful to you: if so,
                    forgive<lb/> me, for my heart was full. Now that baleful
                    &ldquo;Hypo&rdquo; is<lb/> gone, I can write with greater ease. How I
                        should <hi rend="underline">love</hi> to<lb/> see you and chat with you
                    and--yes, fold your precious self to<lb/> my heart, but mine is the fortune of a
                    soldier, and I will<lb/>
                    <hi rend="underline">be</hi> a soldier, a stern unflinching one too, save to my

                </p>
                <p>I will tell you how I came to wander back in<lb/> my reverie. The camp is almost
                    deserted today. Last<lb/> evening, or night rather, for it was midnight, the
                    Adjutant<lb/> came around, and gave the order to<q type="speech">get ready to
                        march with<lb/> two days rations</q>. Well, I did not go, for I have been
                    ailing<lb/> for the past 3 or 4 days and the Surgeon ordered me to keep<lb/>
                    quiet. The regiment started about <orig reg="12:30,">12.30</orig>
                    cro&longs;sed the <orig reg="Blue Ridge,">
                        <name type="place">Blue<lb/> Ridge</name>
                    </orig> and proceeded toward <name type="place">Hillsborough</name>, where they
                    now are.<lb/> The object probably is to prevent the enemy from leaving the<lb/>
                    <pb n="3" entity="DSSR_000000766_0653"/><name type="place">Valley</name>. I
                    judge from the activity prevailing in camp that<lb/> our &ldquo; <name
                        type="person">Little Mac</name>&rdquo; intends to make a forward move
                    soon, but<lb/> new orders must be issued or we shall remain at <name type="place"
                        >Harper's<lb/> Ferry</name>. for a general order was issued to the effect

                    the<lb/> order relates to us. Still, I do not place too much<lb/> confidence in

                <p>Good evening, <name type="person">Addie</name> mine. Will you sit<lb/> upon my
                    lowly couch while we have a little chat? No, well<lb/> sit where you like, your
                        spirit <hi rend="super">must</hi> be with me this,<lb/> the evening of the

                    "the<lb/> Corsair." But about as touching as any lines he wrote, at least<lb/>
                    to me, are those commencing&ldquo;Maid of Athens, ere we part,<lb/> Give, O

                    poetical mood this evening, so pardon<lb/> me if I introduce politics. The

                    is defeated. Will the dog dare again to<lb/> appear before honest loyal men? If
                    he were to enter our<lb/> camp, I greatly fear he would not leave it alive, so
                    intense<lb/> is the hatred existing toward him here. I trust now that<lb/> the
