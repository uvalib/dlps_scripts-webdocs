                        the necessity of having a well thought out and considered design, and they
                        and <name>Mr. Rainey</name> said more work needed to be done and that the

                   <p> The Winter Board meeting is the meeting at which the Auditor
                        of Public Accounts of the Commonwealth customarily meets with the Board to
                        discuss his annual audit of the University. <name>Mr. Kucharski</name>, the
                        Auditor, was detained in Richmond with General Assembly business, so he sent
                        the Deputy Auditor, <name>Mr. William Cole</name>, in his stead. As copies
                        of the Auditor's report had been distributed previously to the Board,
                            <name>Mr. Cole</name> referred Members to the Auditor's comments and led
                        a discussion. </p>
                   <p> As is customary, the Board, on motion, went into Executive
                        Session at 9:05 a.m., to meet privately with the Auditor. </p>
                   <p> That the Audit and Compliance Committee of the Board of
                        Visitors of the University of Virginia convene in Executive Session to
                        review and discuss audit of specific University and Medical Center
                        departments including consulting with General Counsel on compliance with
                        federal CMS regulations. Our oversight review will involve evaluating the
                        performance of specific University managers and personnel and, in the case
                        of the Medical Center, evaluation of its proprietary business- related
                        information relating to adequacy of billing documentation and fiscal
                        management practices where disclosure at this time would adversely affect
                        the competitive position of the Medical Center. This is provided for in
                        Section 2.2-3711 (A) (1), (7) and (23) of the <hi rend="underline">Code of Virginia</hi>. </p>

                        permitted by the Virginia Freedom of Information Act, the Committee resumed

                   <p> That we vote on and record our certification that, to the best
                        of each Board member's knowledge, only public business matters lawfully
                        exempted from open meeting requirements and which were identified in the

                   <p> Subsequent to the January meeting of the Committee, which is
                        to say at the end of registration for the second semester, there were
                        significant problems with ISIS, the computer system used for a range of
                        matters concerning students, particularly class information and
                        registration. <name>Ms. Dorsey</name> asked <name>Dr. Reynolds</name>, Vice
                        President and Chief Information Officer, to report. </p>
                   <p>
                        <name>Dr. Reynolds</name> said the system was set up in the 1980s for use by
                        Admissions and other offices; it was not initially intended for general use
                        by students. Parts of the system are outmoded and some are working beyond
                        capacity. He then described efforts that are being undertaken to rectify the
                        system in light of the recent problems. One solution is to replace the
                        system, but that would be four years off. Consultants have been retained to
                        devise interim solutions. </p>
                   <p> The Chair asked <name>Dr. Reynolds</name> and <name>Mr.
                            Sandridge</name> to do everything possible to avoid a repetition of the
                        problems in January. </p>

                   <p> Reacting to an accident a few days earlier, which involved a
                        student pedestrian being struck and injured while crossing Emmet Street, the
                        Chair asked <name>Mr. Sandridge</name> to comment on pedestrian safety
                        measures in place on the Grounds or planned. <name>Mr. Gibson</name>, the
                        Acting Chief of the University Police, also commented. </p>
                   <p>
                        <name>Mr. Diamonstein</name>, who has been particularly interested in
                        pedestrian safety, suggested that a survey be made of other universities to
                        find out what they are doing in this regard. </p>
                   <p> The Chair suggested that work on some of these measures be

                   <p> The President gave a brief report on the status of the
                        Campaign Case Statement. He said it continues to evolve, and he mentioned a
                        case review session in Richmond and two that are forthcoming - one in
                        Florida and the other in San Francisco. Work to date, he said, has been
                        focused on the development of major themes and theses to serve as
                        foundations for the case. He then told the Board about points which will be

                   <p> The President then gave his customary report. </p>
                   <p> He did a brief review of legislation of interest to the
                        University pending in the General Assembly. </p>
                   <p> The previous Monday in Richmond, there was a press conference
                        at which <name>Senator Allen and Governor Warner</name> endorsed the
                        Commonwealth's investment in research. They were joined by <name>Governor
                            Kaine, Speaker Howell, Senator Chichester and Delegate Callahan</name>. </p>
                   <p> Turning to the Capital Campaign, the President noted that
                        December was a very good month for fundraising, with a philanthropic cash
                        flow of $67.36million for the month; the cash flow for December last year
                        was $55million. With gifts booked so far, 26.65% of the Campaign goal has
                        been achieved with 25.03% of the time elapsed. </p>
                   <p> The President reported several large gifts, not booked in
                        December and thus not included in the total for that month. These include a
                        $45million commitment from the Ivy Foundation for MR6, the children's
                        hospital and the clinical center; $5million from the Claude Moore Foundation
                        for the School of Nursing; and another </p>
                    <pb n="7042"/>
                   <p> $5million commitment yet to be announced. These three
                        commitments, when added to the December 31st total, bring the total money
                        raised in the Campaign to nearly $855million. </p>
                   <p> Since the last Board meeting, fourteen events have been held
                        in fourteen different cities, with a total of 904 guests in attendance. </p>
