            <p>
            This is the day I
            have always written to 
            Jim.  Alas there is no
            longer any need, but I
            must not give pay to the 
            thought that he is lost 
            to me.  That fear has
            hung over me for several
            months, a dark <reg orig="premoni-|tion">premonition</reg>
            of his tragic leave
            
            <pb n="[p.2]"/>
            
            of this world, and <reg orig="prostrat-|ed">prostrated</reg>
            me.  I feel now that
            he is nearer in spirit, 
            than when fighting so far
            away. His chivalrous love
            for France, his brave 
            fight for human rights,
            are inspiring and lift
            my faint spirit to meet
            his in pride and love.
            I had a letter from him
            since his death, in which
            he said he never wished 
            more to live.  He was <reg orig="en-|gaged">engaged</reg> 
            
            <pb n="[p.3]"/>
            
            to be married was he
            not, to Mlle. Helene Du Bouchet?
            He had written much to me of
            her great kindness to him
            and of his fondness for her.
            If they were betrothed would you
            mind asking her to send me 
            her picture?  If she would be so
            good it would be a sweet favor
            bestowed upon his mother, who
            longs to hold those in memory who
            played a great part in his life.
            
            <pb n="[p.4]"/>
            
            I enclose a most beautiful
            tribute to him from President
            Alderman, one for you and one 
            for Mlle. Du Bouchet, which I’m
            sure will give great pleasure to
            both.  I heard that it is his <reg orig="in-|tention">intention</reg>
            to ask permission of
            the French government to bring
            my son’s remains to be buried
            in the grounds of the University
            so the memorial will be a monument
            
            <pb n="[p.5]"/>
            
            a tall shaft I believe.
            Jim gave me long ago the
            address where his perso-
            nal belongings are stored.
            It is Hotel Beauvou, 24 
            Rue de Miromesneil [sic], Paris.
            When these can be sent
            safely, or any recognition
            of his devoted services 
            from the French Army,
            please send to me to
            65 Bellevue Place, Chicago
            Ill.  Because of your
            
            <pb n="[p.6]"/>
            
            loyal and devoted <reg orig="friend-|ship">friendship</reg>
            for Jim I subscribe
            myself
