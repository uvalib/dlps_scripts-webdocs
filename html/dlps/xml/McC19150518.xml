            <p>
            My dear old boy you
            certainly are running in 
            tough luck.  Your letter
            has just arrived.  I don’t
            know whether to be happy
            that your brother escaped
            being killed after such a 
            grand and terrible fight or
            to be sorry that he is so
            wounded.  God Almighty it
            must have been wonderful.
            And all of the regiment,
            with the exception of a 
            handful gone &mdash; It seems too
            terrible, too crushing to
            grasp.  Its great that 
            Kiffin got out of it alive.
            Just think of it.  Ah, he’ll
            be all right soon, but
                        
            <pb n="[p.2]"/>
            
            for God’s sake don’t let
            him go back.  Have him 
            reformed.  He’s done the
            work of many men in
            that fight, given all,
            and it was only a
            miracle you have him
            with you now.  I hate
            like hell to think of
            your going back Paul.
            Not so bad in your
            old regiment, but to go
            in the one they order
            up under the hottest
            fire, at any and all
            occasions, is more than
            you ought to do.
            </p>
        		<p>
            Why don’t you get
            Kiffin transfered [sic] to the 
                        
            <pb n="[p.3]"/>
            
            A.A.  He’ll get the best
            treatment there and
            then you can be near
            both him and your
            fiancee.  I hope she’s
            entirely well by now.
            Let me know when you
            can about your brother
            and about her.  Don’t
            go to any trouble about
            writing.  You’ve got enough
            to occupy you as it is.
            Just a postal some time.
            I’ll write you as often
            as I can just on the
            chance of my letters
            serving to cheer you up
            a bit and giving you
            news from quarters that
                        
            <pb n="[p.4]"/>
            
            “Marche bein”, eh mon
            vieux?  I wish that
            I might be around
            some place where I might
            help you out in some
            way.
        		</p>
        		<p>
            Sure.  I know Thierry &mdash; 
            Delanoue.  He’s been very
            nice to us.  Brings us
            English and Paris papers
            and slips us inside dope,
            which makes it very
            interesting.  He’s a very
            superior sort of a man.
        		</p>
        		<p>
            Just after the last letter
            I wrote you was finished
            the Boches opened up
            on us for fare you well.
            Of course it was damn
                        
            <pb n="[p.5]"/>
            
            tame alongside of what
            you and your brother
            have experienced but we
            thought someone would get
            his.  Two of our cars were
            out.  The shells were coming
            down on the street in
            front of us and in the
            parade ground and on the
            wall of the caserne across
            from us.  One of our
            ambulances whizzed in.
            Just then a shell banged
            down.  The driver jumped
            and ran for it.  Another
            hit as he turned into the
            court yard.  He held his
            order card in front of him
            as he ran and it reminded
            me strongly of a 10-20-30 war
                        
            <pb n="[p.6]"/>
            
            play.  All he needed was
            some Fuller’s earth on his
            shoulders to pat off as
            he entered.  We got a
            call for a town a couple
            of kilometers down to pick
            up some wounded from the
            bombardment.  The next two
            cars went out and got back
            by a side street O.K.  I then
            got a call for a Poste de
            Secours on the hill.  The
            telephonist had made a mistake.
            There wasn’t a wounded man there,
            and so I started back.  It was
            a fine sight.  I could see
            the French artillery in action
            and the German shrapnel
            bursting over the crest.
            Below me in the town clouds
                        
            <pb n="[p.7]"/>
            
            of smoke puffed up as
            a shell landed.  I
            passed groups of soldiers
            watching the action from
            the lee ward side of 
            the road back of stone
            fences.  It was the first 
            time I’ve seen anything
            picturesque to this damn
            cave [sic] fought war.  The
            coloring and the excitement 
            make a picture for me I
            will never forget.  When
            I entered the town I
            noticed an air of complete
            desertion on the street I
            took.  Ahead was a bang
            and a column of smoke,
            and I speeded up.  I ran 
            in hurriedly behind our
                        
            <pb n="[p.8]"/>
            
            last car and just then
            a shell snarled down
            and went off the other
            side of the wall I was
            next to.  My entrance into
            the caserne did not have
            the calm poise and
            dignified manner that it
            should have possessed.  A
            little while afterwards an
            erstwhile Paris buss lumbered
            by.  The fraction of a second
            later a shell smashed
            plumb in the middle of 
            the road and we thought 
            sure the buss would not
            collect fares for awhile.
            The driver and his aide jumped
            off.  We beckoned them
            towards us and in they
                        
            <pb n="[p.9]"/>
            
            came headlong.  It was
            just like a bunch
            running for shelter from 
            a heavy rainstorm.
        		</p>
        		<p>
            A 220 landed yesterday
            ten feet from one of our
            cars that was running
            along the road, but by
            the grace of God and
            and [sic] the rest of the
            Olympian gang it didn’t
            go off.  They’ve got it
            roped in now for no
            one dares to pick it up.
            It seems they are like
            skunks and go off when
            you pet em [sic].

            and no place to crawl

            He’s been wounded twice
            and thinks he’s done
