<p>
     Your last letter, the
one in which you
tell me of the great
amount of work at
the hospital, and of your
depression on account of
the general situation; was
received a couple of days
ago while we were working
night and day.  I wanted
to write to you immediately
and to try and cheer you
up, but until now I
haven’t had a single
minute.  By Wednesday
we are to have six
new cars and as many
drivers so maybe after

<pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0054" n="[p.2]"/>

that I will have a
little leisure.
</p>
<p>
     Really you mustn’t
worry.  Things are going
to come out perfectly
all right.  Of course you’ve
read of the great success
in the north.  That’s the 
start.  The seemingly
perfect German machine
will break, as all
machines do.  I can see
signs of it here where
the fighting is the
most disheartening of
any in the frontier 
long line.  It is
an awfully tedious and
costly war and only

<pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0055" n="[p.3]"/>

the wonderful French
could stand up under it.
</p>
<p>
     Its a most pathetic phase
we see out here, and
yet the soldiers just 
keep plugging along and
bearing the hardships.
</p>
<p>
     The other day a very 
young sous-lieutenant was
killed.  He was of a very 
prominent and influential
family and his aged father,
a one legged veteran of
1870, his mother and his
sister were permitted to 
come out here to his
funeral.  One of our cars
served as the hearse.
The soldiers put the 
beautiful wild flowers

<pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0056" n="[p.4]"/>

that are now in bloom
all over the car.  When
the little procession
reached the newly dug 
grave the mother broke
down and was prostrate
on the ground near the 
coffin.  The venerable 
old father made an 
address.  His voice was
very weak and every so 
often, when he interspersed
“Vie la France”, his words
would choke and tears
come to his eyes.  The 
grave was under a 
most beautiful apple tree
laden with blossoms
and heavy with the 
pungent scent of a 
budding spring.  Very

<pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0057" n="[p.5]"/>

near was a battery of
French artillery and
every time it went
into action the sister
would clutch the arm
of the officer standing
with her and cling
to him as the discharged 
shells tore overhead.
</p>
<p>
     To turn to more amusing
happenings I must tell 
you about the time we
had of it yesterday,
the hottest fire we’ve
been under yet.  To
start out with we
were here in our caserne
going out by turn on
our various calls.  The

<pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0058" n="[p.6]"/>

shells were going 
over us towards a
point some six
kilometers below.  Finally
we noticed their point
of contact was moving
up and suddenly one
whistled in as if
bound for a window
we were standing near.
We couldn’t help but
instinctively dodge, and
as they gradually 
came nearer and nearer 
we moved a bit down
the hall towards the
entrance.  Just then
the range changed and
we got them on that
side.  One broke across

<pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0059" n="[p.7]"/>

from us and as it 
did so we heard one
of our cars come rushing
down the street.  The
driver switched her off,
made a running dive
for shelter and just
then another crashed
down with a snarling
explosion.  The fellow
was holding his order
card out as he ran
towards the door thru [sic]
the small paved court
yard and the whole 
thing reminded me
strongly of the variety 
of dramatic warfare
one sees on the stage.

<pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0060" n="[p.8]"/>

All he needed was
some flour on his
shoulders to beat off
as one does dust in
the best 10-20-30 s.
</p>
<p>
     Lovell and Curtin were
still out and we
wondered if they had 
been hit.  They finally
came in all right.
Today, not fifteen minutes 
ago, a shell burst
right in front of Curtin;
and his car passed 
thru [sic] the smoke and fragments unharmed.
I suppose they’ll begin
on our immediate
location a little later.  During
the shelling yesterday

<pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0061" n="[p.9]"/>

a couple of us had
a call for a poste de
secours.  On the way
back I had the good
fortune to see the French 
Artillery in action; the 
German shrapnel bursting
overhead and many of
the heavier shells bursting
on the town below.  As 
I went along I passed 
groups of soldiers kneeling 
behind fences taking in
the action.  Some were
sports and had glasses.
As I got into town
and headed down a 
street I noticed it
was strangely empty.

<pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0062" n="[p.10]"/>

Ahead I heard a loud
crash and saw dense
clouds of smoke.  Just
as I got into line
behind our cars another obus 
came snarling, sizzling
along and crashed
down just the other 
side of a wall next to 
me.  I too made a graceful, but rapid,
entrance into the caserne.
No sooner had I entered
than an erstwhile Paris
buss came lumbering 
along, a fraction of a
second later a shell
banged down just in 
front of us at what

<pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0063" n="[p.11]"/>

seemed the exact spot
the car occupied, forty 
feet away from our door.
We jumped out to look
and saw the orderly and
driver heading for us.
We beckoned them in,
and in they scurried.
It was all just as
if we were heading
for shelter during a
heavy rainstorm.  I
got the cap of the 
one that hit just
in front and a handful
of the shrapnel.
Well it was a great
time after that.  Shell 
after shell came in
and there was a

<pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0064" n="[p.12]"/>

fearful racket.
</p>
<p>
     Its up here, or 
at the other places at
the front where the
crowd of doctors that
experiment around the
Lycee Pasteur should come.
Here is where the aid
would be of the most
value.  The tent wouldn’t
work here for it
would be shelled off
the map in about
five seconds.  I’d give
anything to see some
of those “swanking”
orderlies, or auxiliaries
of the Miss Mc Adoo,
Miss Econimus brand 
escort the large tent

<pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0065" n="[p.13]"/>

show out here.  We’d get
the tent erected at
night on the ground of
having a nice little 
surprise for the soldiers,
then when day began to
break, and the newly
donated set of highly
polished instruments had
been neatly arranged in
proximity to the operating
table; when the immaculate
orderlies were dolled out
in their best at-the-
front uniform, and
the sweet young
things in pumps and
red crosses had assumed
their finest come-to-me-
poor-soldier-boy smile,

<pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0066" n="[p.14]"/>

why we’d find a 
nice, convenient, good, old
mud ditch to crawl
into and watch the
show.  It certainly would
be “some” show.  I’d
just love to watch the
expressions the minute 
the first shell “eased”
in.
</p>
<p>
     Paul Rockwell has
been given a very long
leave by the Commission.
There is a M. Thierrie up
or down or out here,
or what ever direction
it is known as, that
knows the Vicomte du
Peloux very well and
who received a letter

<pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0067" n="[p.15]"/>

from him the 
other day in which
he asked him to
convey to me the
news.  It pleased 
me very much to be
remembered that way.
 M. Thierrie, who speaks
English perfectly keeps
us supplied with
English ^papers and New York
Heralds.  We can buy
the Paris Matin out
here.
</p>
<p>
     We no longer live
at our former base
but stay now all
the time at our
advance point, which

<pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0068" n="[p.16]"/>

is now our base, so 
to speak.
</p>
 <p>
     The gardens in
this town are a delight.
Never have I seen such
exquisite bits as one
finds in some of them.
They would beat our
Bois all to pieces
Mademoiselle, and I’ve
taken the liberty of
wishing for you to
walk thru [sic] them with
me very, very often.
 </p>
