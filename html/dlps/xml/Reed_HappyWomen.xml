<q>"What act of Legislature was there that thou <lb/>
shouldst be Happy? What if thou wert born and <lb/>

</epigraph>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Myrtle reed</hi> the novelist, the <lb/>
humourist, the poet, was <reg orig="well-|known">well-known</reg>; <lb/>
Myrtle Reed the thinker and <lb/>
philosopher was known to but few, for <lb/>
she was chary about disclosing this side <lb/>
of her complex nature.</p>
<p>When but about eighteen, she became <lb/>
enamoured of Carlyle, and <hi rend="italic">Sartor Resartus</hi> <lb/>
made an indelible impression upon her <lb/>
mind. Other deep thinkers and <reg orig="philoso-|phers">philosophers</reg> <lb/>
followed Carlyle in her reading, and <lb/>
while she read voluminously of poetry and <lb/>
<pb n="iv" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0021"/>
fiction&mdash;grave and gay&mdash;she was always <lb/>
interested in philosophical studies, up to <lb/>
the very time of her untimely death, when <lb/>
some of the modern German philosophers <lb/>
were claiming her attention.</p>
<p>She read so voraciously and thought so <lb/>
deeply that, but for her keen sense of <lb/>
humour, the black cloud which enveloped <lb/>
her the last year of her life would I feel sure <lb/>
have descended upon her years before it did.</p>
<p>Frequently, when talking with the <lb/>
writer, she would quote, almost verbatim, <lb/>
some pertinent passage from <hi rend="italic">Sartor <reg orig="Re-|sartus">Resartus</reg></hi>, <lb/>
always referring to the author <lb/>
thereof as "our friend Tommy C." It <lb/>
was characteristic of her that the more <lb/>
august the personage referred to, the more <lb/>
lightly and familiarly would she name that <lb/>
individual. Thus, Emerson, George Eliot, <lb/>
and others for whose words she had the <lb/>
highest regard, had each his fondly <reg orig="fa-|miliar">familiar</reg> <lb/>
appellation in her conversation.</p>
<pb n="v" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0022"/>
<p>She regarded <hi rend="italic">Sartor Resartus</hi> as one of <lb/>
the greatest books of the century, and one <lb/>
which had exerted an incalculable influence <lb/>
upon her life. In this connection I feel <lb/>
compelled to relate an incident which now <lb/>
seems to me far more significant than it <lb/>
did when it occurred, which was fully ten <lb/>
or twelve years ago when I regarded Myrtle <lb/>
Reed as but little more than a school girl.</p>
<p>I chanced upon her one day in the street <lb/>
car, intent upon a small volume. The <lb/>
only vacant seat was almost opposite her, <lb/>
and into it I sank without attracting her <lb/>
attention, thereby &lpar;in my own opinion&rpar; <lb/>
exhibiting commendatory self-sacrifice. <lb/>
Presently she saw me, and with <reg orig="charac-|teristic">characteristic</reg> <lb/>
cordiality and one of her most <lb/>
comical exclamations&mdash;she was <reg orig="pastmas-|ter">pastmas-ter</reg> <lb/>
in original salutations and pleasantly <lb/>
satirical appellations for her friends&mdash; <lb/>
motioned me to the seat beside her just <lb/>
vacated. I naturally glanced at the little <lb/>
<pb n="vi" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0023"/>
book in her hand and saw that it was her <lb/>
loved and oft-quoted <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, and in reply, <lb/>
as it were, to my expression of pleasurable <lb/>
surprise, she vehemently broke forth with: <lb/>
"Yes, I picked it up when starting on this <lb/>
long car ride because I needed a tonic. <lb/>
The front sheet of my morning paper <lb/>
completely upset me, for it told several <lb/>
stories of divorce in high life on account&mdash; <lb/>
in the majority of the cases&mdash;of the wife's <lb/>
wanting a 'career.' It made me fairly ill. <lb/>
I was positively heartsick over one or two <lb/>
of the cases, and so ashamed of my sex, <lb/>
that my own self-respect fell far below par so <lb/>
that I needed a strong stimulant&mdash;a good, <lb/>
stiff dose of orthodoxy, and where better <lb/>
could I go than to dear old Tommy C.? <lb/>
How I wish that every High School girl <lb/>
were compelled to memorise parts of this <lb/>
chapter&mdash;&lpar;'The Everlasting Yea'&rpar; and <lb/>
recite them aloud every morning as part <lb/>
of her 'devotional exercises'! Listen to <lb/>
<pb n="vii" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0024"/>
this: "&lpar;quoting the paragraph at the head <lb/>
of this introduction&rpar;.</p>
<p>"You forget that there are now no <lb/>
'devotional exercises' in school," I <reg orig="re-|minded">reminded</reg> <lb/>
her, and then queried why she did <lb/>
not include the brothers in her would-be <lb/>
compulsory inculcation of Carlyle's <reg orig="wis-|dom">wisdom</reg>.</p>
<p>"Oh, all need it, unquestionably, but <lb/>
to-day it seems to me it is woman more <lb/>
than man who needs to have a better <lb/>
acquaintance with that word Duty of <lb/>
which dear old Tommy speaks so earnestly <lb/>
in this chapter. When we see so many <lb/>
women utterly regardless of their <reg orig="re-|sponsibilities">responsibilities</reg> <lb/>
to their homes; when we <lb/>
see the incessant pursuit of pleasure&mdash; <lb/>
'happiness' they would call it&mdash;on the <lb/>
part of so many mothers through the many <lb/>
avenues open to the woman of comparative <lb/>
leisure&mdash;card parties or receptions four <lb/>
afternoons a week and the matinee the <lb/>
<pb n="viii" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0025"/>
remaining two, while their children are <lb/>
taking care of themselves&mdash;with all that <lb/>
that phrase implies&mdash;is it any wonder <lb/>
that homes are disrupted and foolish <lb/>
women are seeking 'careers' while their <lb/>
abandoned children and husbands seek <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">their</hi> 'happiness' in diverse and divergent <lb/>
ways?"</p>
<p>I was astonished at this exhibition of <lb/>
strong feeling on her part and while <lb/>
mentally agreeing with her, I appeared to <lb/>
disagree by reminding her that very often <lb/>
it was the husband who was the selfish <lb/>
pleasure-seeker forgetting his home ties.</p>
<p>"I'll admit the truth of your argument," <lb/>
she replied, "but you study the history <lb/>
of disrupted or inharmonious homes that <lb/>
come under your knowledge for the next <lb/>
few months, and see if in the majority of <lb/>
cases the beginning of it was not on account <lb/>
of the woman's distorted sense of her part <lb/>
in the matrimonial partnership, with the <lb/>
<pb n="ix" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0026"/>
resulting discouragement and digression on <lb/>
the part of her husband."</p>
<p>At this time Myrtle was not married <lb/>
&lpar;I had been for many years&rpar;, so, naturally, <lb/>
while secretly concurring, I charged her <lb/>
with unfairness and of being an idealist; <lb/>
but as we were nearing the end of our ride <lb/>
together, I closed the discussion by asking <lb/>
her about the new book she had under way <lb/>
and about which she had told me during <lb/>
its first "glimmering" &lpar;to use her own <lb/>
expression&rpar; some time before&mdash;<hi rend="italic">Lavender <lb/>
and Old Lace</hi>. She reported its progress <lb/>
and then reverted to the first part of our <lb/>
conversation, the disrupted homes, which <lb/>
seemed to weigh upon her. Then <reg orig="re-|ferring">referring</reg> <lb/>
to her novel, she spoke freely. I <lb/>
recall her enthusiasm and her words as <lb/>
though it were but yesterday, for <hi rend="italic">to-day</hi> <lb/>
they seem prophetic: "O, Mary B.! I <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">know</hi> it will be a success; don't you feel <lb/>
that it will be?" I asked her what she <lb/>
<pb n="x" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0027"/>
would call success with her novel. "Why, <lb/>
it would mean thousands of copies sold, <lb/>
which would indicate that my work was <lb/>
pleasing, and it would mean, not only the <lb/>
money I should have to do the things I <lb/>
have dreamed about, but, greater than that, <lb/>
it would mean that there is a sure and <lb/>
pleasant way I may have of preaching my <lb/>
own theology or philosophy, or what you <lb/>
may call it&mdash;sugar-coated, or in <reg orig="hom&oelig;o-|pathic">hom&oelig;opathic</reg> <lb/>
doses. We take our sermons and <lb/>
philosophy so much more readily through <lb/>
fiction than fact, than through didactic <lb/>
preaching. See what a rare opportunity I <lb/>
should have of influencing young people&mdash; <lb/>
especially young women&mdash;for I shall <lb/>
always write stories of simple lives and <lb/>
homes&mdash;stories that I hope will make <lb/>
women think of their particular duties in <lb/>
the home life, and that will set before young <lb/>
girls a high ideal of life&mdash;the highest <lb/>
ideal&mdash;as exemplified in daily home life, <lb/>
<pb n="xi" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0028"/>
and, perhaps, homely, simple tasks. I do <lb/>
not believe in divorce, and I am going to <lb/>
try to lift my voice against it by my <reg orig="in-|direct">indirect</reg> <lb/>
preaching with the pen. Did you <lb/>
ever ponder on the power of the printed <lb/>
word, Mary B.? Every time I see that <lb/>
sentence on our great book store's window <lb/>
shades&mdash;'Words are the only things that <lb/>
last'&mdash;I am duly thankful for my gift of <lb/>
writing and more determined to perfect <lb/>
myself in that art of expression. 'Careers'! <lb/>
As though there <hi rend="italic">could</hi> be a greater career <lb/>
for a woman than making a happy home!"</p>
<p>Here our ways parted for that day. Her <lb/>
earnestness greatly impressed me, and in <lb/>
the light of subsequent events, this recital <lb/>
seems peculiarly pertinent here.</p>
<p>"Success," as she had defined it for <lb/>
herself, she gained in full and overflowing <lb/>
measure. Within a short time after the <lb/>
meeting above recorded, <hi rend="italic">Lavender and Old <lb/>
Lace</hi> made its appearance &lpar;1902&rpar;, to <lb/>
<pb n="xii" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0029"/>
meet with such favour that over five <reg orig="hun-|dred">hundred</reg> <lb/>
thousand copies were sold. It was <lb/>
translated into several foreign languages, <lb/>
Swedish among them, and has been <lb/>
dramatised.</p>
<p>It is unnecessary to dwell upon the story <lb/>
of her phenomenal success with the books <lb/>
which in rapid succession followed <hi rend="italic"><reg orig="Laven-|der">Lavender</reg>.</hi> <lb/>
Suffice it to say in each novel she <lb/>
held to her early ideals and came into heart <lb/>
touch with many thousands of homes <lb/>
throughout the world. The English <lb/>
friends of this gifted writer found in her <lb/>
books "a dash of Jane Austen." Besides <lb/>
writing stories of absorbing heart-interest, <lb/>
she had "her opportunity" of putting <lb/>
into the mouths of her characters bits of <lb/>
her own philosophy. Sometimes in most <lb/>
beautiful, poetical paragraphs, often in <lb/>
witty epigrams couched in the colloquial <lb/>
language of some of her rustic characters; <lb/>
but she never wrote a story that might <lb/>
<pb n="xiii" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0030"/>
not be put into the hands of a young <lb/>
girl.</p>
<p>In 1906, Myrtle Reed became the wife <lb/>
of a young Irish-Canadian, Mr. James <lb/>
Sidney McCullough, and together they <lb/>
made one of the homes that Myrtle Reed <lb/>
had so often written about. Their home <lb/>
became the centre of a large circle of <lb/>
friends and their happiness seemed <reg orig="con-|tagious">contagious</reg>. <lb/>
Some marriages among their <lb/>
friends occurred through the happy <reg orig="inter-|vention">intervention</reg> <lb/>
of herself and husband.</p>
<p>While a member of a literary and artistic <lb/>
family, she was greatly indebted for <lb/>
sympathy in her work to her father and <lb/>
her husband. She often remarked that <lb/>
"if it were not for the love and sympathy <lb/>
of my husband and Daddy, I should not <lb/>
be able to write a single line; they believe <lb/>
in me and inspire me; and the very minute <lb/>
they cease to love me, that minute I shall <lb/>
cease to write."</p>
<pb n="xiv" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0031"/>
<p>Some of her best work was done after <lb/>
her marriage. Recalling here the manner <lb/>
in which her stories came to her&mdash;first the <lb/>
flashing of the title, then the seething of <lb/>
her brain over plot and characters till of <lb/>
their own apparent personalities the latter <lb/>
gravitated into a plot which grew out of <lb/>
the title&mdash;it will perhaps be of interest <lb/>
to relate another little story. Often, <lb/>
before she had recuperated from the strain <lb/>
of producing one novel, another suggestive <lb/>
and pertinacious title would fasten itself <lb/>
upon her brain, and there was no escape <lb/>
from it.</p>
<p>Such was the case but a little while <lb/>
before her death. Two books were in <lb/>
press, to be out within a few weeks, when, <lb/>
already exhausted, the title <hi rend="italic">A Cobweb in <lb/>
the Grass</hi> fastened itself upon her tired <lb/>
brain and could not be shaken off. The <lb/>
plot began to shape itself around the <reg orig="ques-|tion">question</reg> <lb/>
of divorce and the characters&mdash;two of <lb/>
<pb n="xv" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0032"/>
them middle-aged&mdash; "old enough to <reg orig="be-|have">behave</reg> <lb/>
themselves," she said. About two <lb/>
months before her death, she was driving <lb/>
through Lincoln Park with her husband, <lb/>
feeling unusually well and happy, when she <lb/>
spied two little maiden ladies of uncertain <lb/>
age&mdash;evidently twins, dressed very <reg orig="quaint-|ly">quaintly</reg> <lb/>
and exactly alike. "What dear, funny <lb/>
old maids!" she exclaimed, laying her hand <lb/>
on her husband's arm; "drive slowly and <lb/>
turn so as to face them!" They followed <lb/>
them for some time, Myrtle seeming <reg orig="fas-|cinated">fascinated</reg> <lb/>
by them. Finally they drove from <lb/>
them, Myrtle remarking, "They belong in <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">A Cobweb in the Grass</hi> and I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> put them <lb/>
in; but they won't be any Siamese Twins."</p>
<p>But too soon the strain of an overworked <lb/>
brain brought the heavy cloud, and the <lb/>
bitter blackness. Oh! the pity of that <lb/>
bitter last year!</p>
<p>And oh! the joy of it&mdash;that "words are <lb/>
the only things that last."</p>
<pb n="xvi" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0033"/>
<p>At almost any page of any book Myrtle <lb/>
Reed wrote we can cull inspiring and <lb/>
amusing bits of her philosophy, as the <lb/>
following paragraphs will indicate: <lb/>
<q>"The only way to win happiness is to give <lb/>
it. The more we give the more we have." <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Old Rose and Silver.</hi></q>
<q>"Happiness is not a circumstance nor a set <lb/>
of circumstances; it's only a light and we may <lb/>
keep it burning if we will. We deliberately <lb/>
make nearly all of our unhappiness with our <lb/>
own unreasonable discontent, and nothing <lb/>
will ever make us happy, deary, except the <lb/>
spirit within."&mdash;<hi rend="italic">Lavender and Old Lace.</hi></q>
<q>"The happiness of duty is in every creed, <lb/>
but the duty of happiness is seldom taught." <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Year Book.</hi></q>
<q>"You have only one day at a time to live. <lb/>
Get all the content you can out of it, and let <lb/>
the rest wait, like a bud, till the sun of <reg orig="to-|morrow">to-morrow</reg> <lb/>
shows you the rose."&mdash;<hi rend="italic">The Master's <lb/>
Violin.</hi></q>
<q>"The shallows touch the pebbles, and <lb/>
behold, there is a little song. The deeps are <lb/>
stirred to their foundations, and long <reg orig="after-|ward">afterward</reg> <lb/>
there is a single vast strophe, majestic <lb/>
<pb n="xvii" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0034"/>
and immortal, which takes its place by right <lb/>
in the symphony of pain."&mdash;<hi rend="italic">The Master's <lb/>
Violin.</hi></q>
<q>"The appointed thing comes at the <reg orig="ap-|pointed">appointed</reg> <lb/>
time in the appointed way. There <lb/>
is no terror save my own fear."&mdash;<hi rend="italic">Master of the <lb/>
Vineyard.</hi></q>
<q>"Life will give us back whatever we put <lb/>
into it. In a way, it's just like a bank. Put <lb/>
joy into the world and it will come back to <lb/>
you with compound interest, but you can't <lb/>
check out either money or happiness when you <lb/>
have made no deposits."&mdash;<hi rend="italic">Flower of the Dusk.</hi></q>
<q>"It is a way of life and one of its inmost <lb/>
compensations&mdash;this finding of a reality so <lb/>
much easier than our fears."&mdash;<hi rend="italic">A Spinner in <lb/>
the Sun.</hi></q>
<q>"It is unyielding Honour at the core of <lb/>
things that keeps them sound and sweet." <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">The Spinster Book.</hi></q>
<q>"God has made it so that love given must <lb/>
unfailingly come back an hundred-fold; the <lb/>
more we give, the richer we are. And Heaven <lb/>
is only a place where the things that have <lb/>
gone wrong here will at last come right." <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Flower of the Dusk.</hi></q>
<pb n="xviii" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0035"/>
<q>"Nothing strengthens a woman's <reg orig="self-|confidence">self-confidence</reg> <lb/>
like a proposal. One is a wonder, <lb/>
two a superfluity, and three an epidemic. <lb/>
Four are proof of unusual charm, five go to <lb/>
the head, and it is a rare girl whom six <lb/>
or seven will not permanently spoil."&mdash;<hi rend="italic">The <lb/>
Spinster Book.</hi></q>
<q>"We are never young but once, and Youth <lb/>
asks no greater privilege than to fight its <lb/>
own battles. It is mistaken kindness to <lb/>
shield&mdash;it weakens one in the years to come." <lb/>
&mdash;<hi rend="italic">The Master's Violin.</hi></q>
<q>"True lovers are as certain to return as <lb/>
Bo-Peep's flock or a systematically deported <lb/>
cat. Shamefaced, but surely, the man comes <lb/>
back."&mdash;<hi rend="italic">The Spinster Book.</hi></q>
<q>"Art thou in doubt? Then let thy <reg orig="strain-|ing">straining</reg> <lb/>
eyes look up to the Star of Faith. Art <lb/>
thou disheartened? The light of new <reg orig="cour-|age">courage</reg> <lb/>
shall shine upon thee there. Art thou <lb/>
sorrowful? Put by thy rue and gather the <lb/>
Life Everlasting."&mdash;<hi rend="italic">Later Love-Letters of a <lb/>
Musician.</hi></q>
<q>"So far as man is of the earth, earthy, by <lb/>
the earth and its fruits may he be healed, but <lb/>
the heavenly part of him may be ministered <lb/>
unto by the angels of God."&mdash;<hi rend="italic">Old Rose and <lb/>
Silver.</hi></q>
<pb n="xix" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0036"/>
<q>"Making an issue of a little thing is one of <lb/>
the surest ways to spoil happiness. One's <lb/>
personal pride is felt to be vitally injured by <lb/>
surrender, but there is no quality of human <lb/>
nature so nearly royal as the ability to yield <lb/>
gracefully. It shows small confidence in <lb/>
one's own nature to fear that compromise <lb/>
lessens self-control. To consider constantly <lb/>
the comfort and happiness of another is not a <lb/>
sign of weakness, but a sign of strength." <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">The Spinster Book.</hi></q>
<q>"One of love's divinest gifts is the power to <lb/>
bestow beauty wherever it goes. &hellip; For the <lb/>
beauty of the spirit may transfigure its <reg orig="earth-|bound">earthbound</reg> <lb/>
temple, as some vast and grey <reg orig="cathe-|dral">cathedral</reg>, <lb/>
with its lights streaming from its <reg orig="stained-|glass">stained-glass</reg> <lb/>
windows and eloquent with chimes and <lb/>
singing, may breathe incense and benediction <lb/>
upon every passer-by."&mdash;<hi rend="italic">Master of the <reg orig="Vine-|yard">Vineyard</reg>.</hi></q> <lb/>
<q>"Fame is a laurel wreath laid upon a <lb/>
tomb."</q>
<q>"Better a thousand times that marriage <lb/>
should spoil a career, than for the career to <lb/>
spoil marriage."</q>
<q>"Anger is a better weapon than tears; a <lb/>
burr commands more respect than a sensitive <lb/>
plant."</q>
<pb n="xx" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0037"/>
<q>"I think that the Ideal consists in minding <lb/>

<p>She kept constantly at hand a small note <lb/>
book, and whenever an idea for a story or <lb/>
poem, or article of any character occurred <lb/>
to her, she jotted it down. Even a title, <lb/>
without a "glimmering" of anything to <lb/>
follow when it fastened itself before her <lb/>
"mind's eye," as on a screen, was noted. <lb/>
After a while substance matter began to <lb/>
gravitate toward a certain subject or title, <lb/>
and in an incredibly short time lo! the <lb/>
finished short story, poem, or novel <reg orig="ap-|peared">appeared</reg>.</p>
<p>At one time for a period of several weeks, <lb/>
we had seats together for a course of <lb/>
lectures, and we planned to be on hand a <lb/>
half hour early each day in order to have <lb/>
time for a little chat. One day, we were <lb/>
discussing happiness and success and their <lb/>
contributing elements, which had been <lb/>
<pb n="xxii" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0039"/>
brought to our minds by something said <lb/>
by the lecturer the previous week. The <lb/>
following week she said: "I have <reg orig="glimmer-|ings">glimmerings</reg> <lb/>
of a good idea, I think, for a series of <lb/>
short biographies of noted women whose <lb/>
lives, I believe, beautifully illustrate our <lb/>
little discussion of last week and our <reg orig="de-|cision">decision</reg> <lb/>
that nothing but unselfish service <lb/>
brings us happiness regardless of worldly <lb/>
possessions or the want of them." She <lb/>
then told me the names of her "heroines <lb/>
in real life," whose histories she intended <lb/>
to shape into a series of magazine sketches; <lb/>
and I heartily concurred in her judgment.</p>
<p>Time hurried on&mdash;each weekly meeting <lb/>
had its own timely little topic under <reg orig="dis-|cussion&mdash;and">discussion&mdash;and</reg> <lb/>
before we were aware the <lb/>
course was at an end, and we had not once <lb/>
reverted to the "biographies." Life grew <lb/>
more complex for both of us, and we met <lb/>
less frequently, for Chicago's magnificent <lb/>
distances often interfere with the pursuit <lb/>
<pb n="xxiii" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0040"/>
of friendship; but we "met" over the <lb/>
phone, and a few times each year, usually <lb/>
with others around us, but I heard nothing <lb/>
about the sketches above mentioned. <lb/>
But here they are, ready to come into your <lb/>
lives to inspire and bless you, whether you <lb/>
be the aged Grandmother whose days are <lb/>
happiest through retrospection, or the <lb/>
gay young girl in her teens seeking <reg orig="happi-|ness">happiness</reg> <lb/>
through her dreams of the future.</p>
<p>In this little book of twelve biographical <lb/>
sketches entitled <hi rend="italic">Happy Women</hi>, Myrtle <lb/>
Reed has performed a real service to <lb/>
humanity. These sketches tell the stories <lb/>
of women, more or less famous, six of them <lb/>
married, six unmarried. The subjects, <lb/>
many of them, were well-known in <reg orig="litera-|ture">literature</reg> <lb/>
before our beloved author determined <lb/>
to write of them. But so trenchant and <lb/>
pertinent are <hi rend="italic">her</hi> stories of these noble <lb/>
women, that we read them with the avidity <lb/>
of a first reading.</p>
<pb n="xxiv" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0041"/>
<p>This group, you will observe, contains <lb/>
two queens; one "First Lady of the Land"; <lb/>
two maiden sisters of famous brothers, each <lb/>
of whom might have surpassed her brother's <lb/>
fame had she not unselfishly chosen <lb/>
obscurity and <hi rend="italic">service</hi> that her brother <lb/>
might shine in the world; one&mdash;perhaps the <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">greatest</hi>&mdash;woman poet; one great actress; <lb/>
one great singer&mdash;perhaps both of the <lb/>
latter the greatest in their professions; <lb/>
two nurses; one author; and one we <lb/>
shall have to classify as a preacher and <lb/>
humanitarian.</p>
<p>"Why," ask you, "did she give them the <lb/>
name of 'Happy Women' when in the life <lb/>
of each she chronicles some sorrows?"</p>
<p>Because each life represents <reg orig="achieve-|ment">achievement</reg> <lb/>
over some obstacles, self-mastery <lb/>
and unselfish service to Humanity in a <lb/>
large or small circle of life, which meant <lb/>
the loving devotion of those thus served. <lb/>
The happiness which comes from the <lb/>
<pb n="xxv" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0042"/>
knowledge of having "performed one's <lb/>
nearest duty," or through unselfish <reg orig="ser-|vice">service</reg> <lb/>
to others, is the highest happiness one <lb/>
can achieve, and <hi rend="italic">this</hi> happiness came to <lb/>
each woman herein named. Was it not <lb/>
rather the "Blessedness" of Carlyle that <lb/>
enveloped these women whose lives form <lb/>
so valuable a fraction toward the education <lb/>
of Humanity?</p>
<p>One of the latter-day philosophers of <lb/>
whom Myrtle was fond wrote: <lb/>
<q>"Humanity rises and falls, rises and falls <lb/>
in great wavelike motions, and with each <lb/>
huge wave it is purified of some dross of error, <lb/>
and enriched by some pearl of truth brought <lb/>
up from the deeps."</q>
<q>"Individuals die, but so much of truth as <lb/>
they have received and revealed to Humanity, <lb/>
so much of unselfish, uncalculating service <lb/>
as they have rendered to Humanity is not <lb/>
forgotten&mdash;cannot be lost when they die; <lb/>
Humanity recalls their lives, treasures up <lb/>
their contribution, and those who follow <lb/>
where they trod reap the benefit."</q></p>
<pb n="xxvi" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0043"/>
<p>Each of us is born into an atmosphere <lb/>
of thoughts and beliefs cumulated by the <lb/>
whole of bygone Humanity, and each of us <lb/>
brings, unconsciously mayhap, a more or <lb/>
less valuable contribution to the life of <lb/>
Humanity to come. Some one has likened <lb/>
the education of Humanity to the rise of <lb/>
those pyramids in the East, to which every <lb/>
passer-by adds a stone. So <hi rend="italic">we</hi> <reg orig="pass&mdash;way-|farers">pass&mdash;wayfarers</reg> <lb/>
of a day&mdash;each casting on to the <reg orig="grow-|ing">growing</reg> <lb/>
pyramids of Humanity his life's stone, <lb/>
called to complete <hi rend="italic">our</hi> education elsewhere.</p>
<p>So passed along the great highway of <lb/>
life&mdash;for just a morning&mdash;it seems, the <lb/>
bright, joyous, generous-hearted being, <lb/>
whose contribution to the education of <lb/>
Humanity has made us ever more her <lb/>
debtors&mdash;Myrtle Reed McCullough, and <lb/>
the noble women whose lives she lays before <lb/>
us in this little volume.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Were</hi> these "Happy Women" as Carlyle <lb/>
defined happiness? Surely blessedness <lb/>
<pb n="xxvii" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0044"/>
followed them all the days of their life. <lb/>
Is not that truly higher than Happiness <lb/>
as the world calls happiness?</p>
<p>Were their lives "successful" as the <lb/>
world calls success, or as Myrtle defined <lb/>
that word? Let us apply this definition of <lb/>
the word and see if they do not measure up <lb/>
to the highest line: <lb/>
<q>"He has achieved success who has lived <lb/>
well, laughed often, and loved much; who has <lb/>
gained the respect of intelligent men and the <lb/>
love of little children; who has filled his niche <lb/>
and accomplished his task; who has left the <lb/>
world better than he found it, whether by an <lb/>
improved poppy, a perfect poem, or a rescued <lb/>
Soul; who has never lacked appreciation of <lb/>
earth's beauty or failed to express it; who has <lb/>
always looked for the best in others and given <lb/>
the best he had; whose life was an inspiration; <lb/>
whose memory a benediction."</q></p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Though</hi> Dolly Madison was born in <lb/>
North Carolina, one always thinks <lb/>
of her as a true Virginian. Her father, <lb/>
John Payne, and her mother were strict <lb/>
Quakers, and yet the little maid was <lb/>
compelled to wear "a white linen mask <lb/>
to keep every ray of sunshine from her <lb/>
complexion, a sun-bonnet sewed on her <lb/>
head every morning by her careful mother, <lb/>
and long gloves covering the hands and <lb/>
arms."</p>
<p>Possibly, to this unrelenting care was <lb/>
due the exquisite complexion which was <lb/>
afterward Dolly Madison's greatest beauty, <lb/>
but one would hate to see it proved, lest <lb/>
the city streets be filled with ladies veiled <lb/>
as closely as any Moslem.</p>
<pb n="4" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0053"/>
<p>When Dolly was eighteen, the family <lb/>
moved to Philadelphia amid incredible <lb/>
difficulties. A journey which is now a <lb/>
matter of a few hours in a Pullman car <lb/>
was then made by carriage over wellnigh <lb/>
impassable roads. Sometimes, lost in a <lb/>
trackless morass, horses would flounder <lb/>
hopelessly in the mud and travellers be <lb/>
obliged to wait until other teams came to <lb/>
their rescue.</p>
<p>Once in Philadelphia, Miss Payne's <lb/>
black hair, blue eyes, rose-leaf complexion, <lb/>
and winning ways played havoc with the <lb/>
hearts of susceptible swains. At <reg orig="twenty-|two">twenty-two</reg>, <lb/>
she married John Todd, a young <lb/>
lawyer who had been of great assistance <lb/>
to her father in his financial difficulties. <lb/>
According to some accounts, the marriage <lb/>
was not one of love on her part, though <lb/>
unquestionably so upon his.</p>
<p>Yet she made him a devoted wife and <lb/>
bore him two children. Three years after <lb/>
<pb entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0054"/>
<figure id="f2" rend="page" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0054">

<pb entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0055"/>
<pb n="5" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0056"/>
their marriage, yellow fever broke out in <lb/>
Philadelphia, and presently assumed the <lb/>
proportions of an epidemic. When her <lb/>
baby was but three weeks old, she was <lb/>
carried on a litter to Gray's Ferry to escape <lb/>
the plague. Mr. Todd returned to <reg orig="Phila-|delphia">Philadelphia</reg> <lb/>
to attend his father and mother, <lb/>
who were both dying of it. When he <lb/>
came to Gray's Ferry, the fever was <lb/>
already in his veins. In a few hours, <lb/>
both he and the baby were dead, and the <lb/>
young mother believed to be dying.</p>
<p>At length, however, she recovered, and <lb/>
after the plague had died out, she returned <lb/>
to Philadelphia with her mother and her <lb/>
infant son, Payne Todd, afterward fated <lb/>
to cause her so many heartaches and so <lb/>
much distress. She was twenty-five or <lb/>
-six, in the full bloom of her youthful <lb/>
beauty, and proved so dangerously <reg orig="attract-|ive">attractive</reg> <lb/>
to the eligible gallants that a friend <lb/>
said to her: "Really, Dolly, thou must <lb/>
<pb n="6" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0057"/>
hide thy face, there are so many staring <lb/>
at thee."</p>
<p>Among the strangers who admired the <lb/>
blue-eyed beauty in her daily promenades <lb/>
along the fashionable thoroughfares of <lb/>
Philadelphia, was James Madison, "Father <lb/>
of the Constitution." He begged Aaron <lb/>
Burr, who boarded with Mrs. Payne and <lb/>
her daughter to present him.</p>
<p>"Dear Friend," wrote Dolly, to Mrs. <lb/>
Lee, "thou must come to me. Aaron <lb/>
Burr says that the great little Madison <lb/>
has asked to be brought to see me this <lb/>
evening."</p>
<p>Mr. Madison was forty-three, and <reg orig="pre-|sumably">presumably</reg>, <lb/>
a confirmed bachelor. The <lb/>
young woman to whom he had long ago <lb/>
been engaged to be married, forsook him <lb/>
for a young clergyman who, as Madison <lb/>
said, "hung over her harpsichord." But, <lb/>
if he was cherishing sentimental regret for <lb/>
this lost love, it instantly vanished at his <lb/>
<pb n="7" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0058"/>
presentation to the beautiful young widow <lb/>
gowned in "mulberry satin, with tulle <lb/>
kerchief folded over the bosom."</p>
<p>Presently, Dame Gossip coupled their <lb/>
names. Mrs. Washington sent for the <lb/>
young woman and demanded to know <lb/>
whether or not the reported engagement <lb/>
were true. "Dolly," said the President's <lb/>
wife, "if it is so, do not be ashamed to <lb/>
confess it; rather be proud. He will <lb/>
make thee a good husband, and all the <lb/>
better for being so much older. We both <lb/>
approve of it; the esteem and friendship <lb/>
existing between Mr. Madison and my <lb/>
husband is very great and we would wish <lb/>
thee to be happy."</p>
<p>Thus the royal sanction was accorded <lb/>
the proposed match, "and so they were <lb/>
married and lived happily ever after," <lb/>
like the people in the fairy tales. In the <lb/>
midst of the wedding festivities, the <reg orig="newly-|married">newly-married</reg> <lb/>
pair entered their coach for the <lb/>
<pb n="8" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0059"/>
long drive to Montpelier, a hundred miles <lb/>
away, accompanied, no doubt, by a shower <lb/>
of rice and an old shoe or two.</p>
<p>When they returned to Philadelphia, <lb/>
she laid aside her Quaker gowns forever, <lb/>
at her husband's request, and afterward, <lb/>
when Jefferson was President, she assisted <lb/>
in the official entertaining at the White <lb/>
House.</p>
<p>Upon poor Abigail Adams fell the brunt <lb/>
of all the pioneering in the President's <lb/>
new residence at Washington. She had <lb/>
it in good running order when her successor <lb/>
took possession, but found no joy in it <lb/>
herself. The mansion stood then where <lb/>
it stands now, but was unenclosed and <lb/>
there was no way to get a fence around it, <lb/>
for, though wood was plenty, labour was <lb/>
scarce. Driven almost mad by appalling <lb/>
household difficulties, poor Abigail Adams <lb/>
was obliged to have the family washing <lb/>
dried in the great East Room!</p>
<pb n="9" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0060"/>
<p>So, when Dolly Madison was made <lb/>
mistress of the White House, she was <lb/>
familiar with every nook and corner of it, <lb/>
having been very intimate with the <reg orig="Jeffer-|son">Jefferson</reg> <lb/>
household. At the inauguration ball, <lb/>
she wore buff velvet, with pearls on her <lb/>
neck and arms, and a Parisian hat&mdash; <lb/>
probably one of the first in America&mdash; <lb/>
adorned with an awe-inspiring bird of <lb/>
paradise plume. Mr. Madison was small <lb/>
and easily lost sight of in the crowd, but <lb/>
Dolly's gorgeous plumage, towering far <lb/>
above her stately head, made a brilliant <lb/>
spot in the assemblage, not to be missed <lb/>
by anyone within range of it.</p>
<p>Very soon, she was the most popular <lb/>
person in the United States. Henry Clay <lb/>
said, "Everybody loves Mrs. Madison." <lb/>
She answered, with a smile, "Mrs. <reg orig="Madi-|son">Madison</reg> <lb/>
loves everybody." She continued to <lb/>
set her table after the old Virginia fashion&mdash; <lb/>
plenty to eat, and all known eatables&mdash; <lb/>
<pb n="10" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0061"/>
and was criticised for it by the wife of a <lb/>
European diplomat, who remarked that <lb/>
her table was "more like a harvest-home <lb/>
supper than an elegant entertainment." <lb/>
With perfect good nature, the mistress <lb/>
of the White House replied: "The <reg orig="pro-|fusion">profusion</reg> <lb/>
of my table is the result of the <lb/>
prosperity of my country, and I must <lb/>
therefore continue to prefer Virginia <reg orig="liber-|ality">liberality</reg> <lb/>
to European elegance."</p>
<p>During the War of 1812, Washington was <lb/>
the scene of much excitement. While a <lb/>
brilliant naval ball was being given in <lb/>
honour of the capture of the <hi rend="italic">Alert</hi> and <lb/>
<foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italic">Guerri&egrave;re</hi></foreign>, Lieutenant Hamilton, son of <lb/>
the Secretary of the Navy, entered with a <lb/>
third captured flag, that of the <hi rend="italic"><reg orig="Macedo-|nian">Macedonian</reg></hi>, <lb/>
which, with great ceremony, he laid <lb/>
at the feet of Mrs. Madison. Her colour <lb/>
came and went while the great hall rang <lb/>
with cheers.</p>
<p>On New Year's Day, 1813, the White <lb/>
<pb n="11" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0062"/>
House was open to everyone. The crowd <lb/>
was large and noisy and the Marine Band <lb/>
could scarcely make itself heard above the <lb/>
din. Mrs. Madison wore rose-coloured <lb/>
satin trimmed with ermine, and from her <lb/>
turban towered white ostrich plumes "like <lb/>
the helmet of Navarre."</p>
<p>President Madison was re-elected, and <lb/>
in 1814 the British burned Washington. <lb/>
The President and his household were <lb/>
forced to flee, taking with them public <lb/>
documents and a few personal belongings. <lb/>
With her own hands, Dolly Madison saved <lb/>
the large portrait of Washington which <lb/>
hung in the White House and the <reg orig="Declara-|tion">Declaration</reg> <lb/>
of Independence. Forty-eight hours <lb/>
afterward, when they returned to the <lb/>
city, the White House, Treasury, and <lb/>
Post-Office were smouldering ruins. But, <lb/>
within a fortnight, "the burning of <reg orig="Wash-|ington">Washington</reg> <lb/>
was avenged by the death of the <lb/>
invading commander, the repulse of the <lb/>
<pb n="12" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0063"/>
English troops at Baltimore, the British <lb/>
defeat at Plattsburg, and the surrender of <lb/>
the fleet on Lake Champlain." Even <lb/>
in the English Parliament, the burning of <lb/>
the Capital was stigmatised as "an <reg orig="out-|rage">outrage</reg> <lb/>
and a return to barbarism."</p>
<p>When the war was over, Mrs. Madison <lb/>
resumed her gay life in the private home <lb/>
which was the official residence, now that <lb/>
the White House was no more. Everyone <lb/>
was overjoyed because peace had been <lb/>
declared at last, and no one in higher <lb/>
spirits than the blooming beauty who was <lb/>
then the First Lady of the Land.</p>
<p>At one of her receptions, after offering <lb/>
Henry Clay her snuff-box, she took a <lb/>
pinch herself and drew out a large and <lb/>
gayly coloured handkerchief. She <reg orig="re-|ferred">referred</reg> <lb/>
to the dainty handkerchief of linen <lb/>
and lace which was tucked into her belt, <lb/>
as her "polisher." It was at one of her <lb/>
receptions that the Portuguese Minister <lb/>
<pb n="13" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0064"/>
characterised Washington as a "City of <lb/>
Magnificent Distances," and added that <lb/>
"Providence takes care of idiots, <reg orig="drunk-|ards">drunkards</reg>, <lb/>
and the United States." It was <lb/>
at a dinner of Mrs. Madison's that a <reg orig="well-|known">well-known</reg> <lb/>
diplomat asked for another glass <lb/>
of wine, observing that "water has tasted <lb/>
of sinners ever since the flood."</p>
<p>At the end of Mr. Madison's second <lb/>
term, they retired to Montpelier, to live <lb/>
as quiet a country life as the hordes of <lb/>
visitors would permit. Mrs. Madison <lb/>
relates quite casually, in a letter to a <lb/>
friend, that they had "ninety guests for <lb/>
dinner that day, three of them being <lb/>
women." She adds that it was "less <lb/>
trouble than twenty-five in Washington."</p>
<p>She survived her husband by thirteen <lb/>
years, returning to Washington when the <lb/>
loneliness at Montpelier became too great, <lb/>
and, possibly, anxious to return to the <lb/>
scene of her old triumphs. Brave and <lb/>
<pb n="14" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0065"/>
brilliant and beautiful to the last, the <reg orig="old-|time">old-time</reg> <lb/>
lady held her court at seventy-four, <lb/>
with her neck covered with tulle, as "after <lb/>
seventy the throat is apt to be a little <lb/>
scraggy." Yet, after a career of <reg orig="extra-|ordinary">extraordinary</reg> <lb/>
length and brightness, she said <lb/>
to a young woman who was in trouble <lb/>
over some trifle: "My dear, do not trouble <lb/>
about it&mdash;there is nothing in this world <lb/>
really worth caring for."</p>
<p>The grass has grown deep over Dolly <lb/>
Madison's grave, and the moss has <reg orig="en-|croached">encroached</reg> <lb/>
upon the tombstone which bears <lb/>
her name, misspelled "Dolley." This <lb/>
brings a smile with tears in it to the one <lb/>
who pauses there, for Dolly could spell!</p>
<p>And, if there be such, perhaps sometimes <lb/>
a wandering spirit steals at midnight to <lb/>
the new White House, to pass, with silent <lb/>
footfalls through the empty rooms, peer <lb/>
shyly at the glistening floor and wonderful <lb/>
golden piano in the crystal-hung East <lb/>
<pb n="15" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0066"/>
Room, and then to return, gladly, to the <lb/>
place of mystery whence it came, since <lb/>
"there is nothing in this world really <lb/>
worth caring for!"</p>

<p>"<hi rend="small-caps">Uneasy</hi> lies the head that wears a <lb/>
crown," yet, now and then, upon <lb/>
the sombre page of history, a single life <lb/>
stands star-like, in the midst of many <lb/>
shadows, sending into the darkness the <lb/>
steady light of joy.</p>
<p>Queen Louise, the beautiful mother of <lb/>
William I, of Germany, though destined <lb/>
to suffer much, kept always that unfailing <lb/>
serenity which is the outward evidence of <lb/>
inner light. Unlike most royal women, <lb/>
her marriage was one of love. She was <lb/>
seventeen, with large blue eyes, fair hair, <lb/>
and an exquisite complexion, when Crown <lb/>
Prince Frederick William first saw&mdash;and <lb/>
loved&mdash;her.</p>
<p>Years after her death, he said to Bishop <lb/>
<pb n="20" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0071"/>
Eylert: "I felt when I first saw her, ''t is <lb/>
she, or none on earth.' That expression <lb/>
is somewhere in Schiller, I forget where, <lb/>
but I have it, and it exactly describes the <lb/>
emotions which sprang up in my heart at <lb/>
that moment."</p>
<p>On Christmas Eve, 1793, the two were <lb/>
married. Two days before the time set for <lb/>
the wedding, the Royal procession entered <lb/>
Berlin. The streets were gay with flags and <lb/>
flowers, triumphal arches were erected, and <lb/>
music sounded everywhere. Nearly a <reg orig="hund-|red">hundred</reg> <lb/>
children were waiting opposite the <lb/>
Royal Palace, and when Louise descended <lb/>
from the state coach a little boy recited a <lb/>
poem, bidding her welcome, and a little <lb/>
girl in white shyly offered her a bouquet.</p>
<p>Smiling, Louise bent over and kissed <lb/>
the child. "What has your Highness <lb/>
done!" cried a lady-in-waiting, aghast.</p>
<p>"Is that wrong? asked the Princess. <lb/>
"May I never do that again?"</p>

<pb n="21" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0074"/>
<p>Christmas Eve, in the presence of the <lb/>
Royal Family only, the diamond crown of <lb/>
the Hohenzollerns was placed upon her <lb/>
fair head. Afterward, under a crimson <lb/>
velvet canopy heavily embroidered in <lb/>
gold, Louise married the man of her choice. <lb/>
By her request, the money which the <lb/>
citizens of Berlin desired to spend upon a <lb/>
splendid festival in her honour, was given <lb/>
to the widows and orphans of soldiers who <lb/>
had died in the late war, fighting for her <lb/>
beloved Germany.</p>
<p>The Crown Prince was said to be the <lb/>
handsomest man in Germany. He was <lb/>
tall and dignified, with a military air, <lb/>
and bore himself nobly, as became a <lb/>
future Emperor. Throughout his long <lb/>
life, his tender devotion to his wife was <lb/>
ever manifest, in speech, thought, and <lb/>
action.</p>
<p>A pretty story is told of the Princess's <lb/>
first birthday after her marriage. The <lb/>
<pb n="22" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0075"/>
King asked her what she would like most <lb/>
for her birthday. "A handful of gold," <lb/>
she answered, "to give to the poor." <lb/>
"How large a handful would the <reg orig="birthday-|child">birthday-child</reg> <lb/>
like to have?" he continued. "As <lb/>
large as the heart of the best of kings," <lb/>
returned Louise, quickly. She received <lb/>
enough to remember her favourite <reg orig="pension-|ers">pensioners</reg> <lb/>
liberally, and to give a dinner to her <lb/>
servants and their friends&mdash;eighty in all.</p>
<p>Both disliked the Court ceremonial, <lb/>
and after the Crown Prince became King, <lb/>
in 1797, they lived as simply as before. <lb/>
At this time she wrote to a friend: "To <lb/>
train my children to become benevolent <lb/>
lovers of mankind is my warmest and <lb/>
dearest wish. I even nourish the glad <lb/>
hope of fulfilling my aim."</p>
<p>Daily, she set them a beautiful example <lb/>
in her own life. Once, she gave all the <lb/>
children in a village new clothes for a <lb/>
harvest festival. She bought all the toys <lb/>
<pb n="23" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0076"/>
in a poor woman's shop and gave them <lb/>
back to her, saying: "Give these to your <lb/>
crown prince in the name of mine." <lb/>
Unclasping the gold necklace she wore, she <lb/>
gave it to Goethe's mother, in honour of <lb/>
the genius of her son. She escorted <lb/>
around the palace grounds an unhappy <lb/>
couple to whom the gatekeeper had <lb/>
denied entrance. She made an important <lb/>
personage wait until the Court shoemaker <lb/>
had finished his errand, the workman's <lb/>
time being more valuable. Once, upon <lb/>
learning that a little girl had been sent <lb/>
home, because she was too homely to <lb/>
assist in strewing flowers before the Queen, <lb/>
she sent for the weeping child and made <lb/>
her an object of especial consideration <lb/>
throughout the day.</p>
<p>Ten children were born to Louise in <lb/>
seventeen years. Three of them died in <lb/>
early youth, and the royal mother grieved <lb/>
for them as any peasant might have done, <lb/>
<pb n="24" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0077"/>
but these sorrows served to draw the <lb/>
King and Queen nearer.</p>
<p>"You will be pleased to hear," she <lb/>
wrote to her father, "that the misfortune <lb/>
which has fallen upon us has not affected <lb/>
our domestic happiness; indeed, it seems <lb/>
to have drawn us nearer together, and <lb/>
strengthened our affections. The King, <lb/>
who is the best of men, is kinder than ever. <lb/>
Often I fancy that I see in him the lover <lb/>
and the bridegroom; more in actions than <lb/>
in words do I perceive his constant <reg orig="de-|votion">devotion</reg> <lb/>
to me.</p>
<p>"Only yesterday he said to me, looking <lb/>
at me with his guileless eyes and earnest <lb/>
expression of countenance: 'Dear Louise, <lb/>
thou hast become dearer and more <reg orig="pre-|cious">precious</reg> <lb/>
than ever to me in misfortune. Now <lb/>
I know by experience what I possess in thee. <lb/>
Let the storm continue without, as it will, <lb/>
if only our happiness remain undisturbed, <lb/>
we are secure. Because I love thee so <lb/>
<pb n="25" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0078"/>
fondly, I have desired our youngest born <lb/>
daughter to be called Louise. May she <lb/>
become a Louise.'</p>
<p>"This tenderness on his part affected <lb/>
me to tears. It is my pride, my joy, and <lb/>
my happiness to possess the love of the <lb/>
best of men, and because I love him in <lb/>
return with all my heart and we are so <lb/>
united that the will of one is the will of <lb/>
the other, it is very easy for us to preserve <lb/>
this harmony day by day. In a word, <lb/>
he pleases me in all points, and I please <lb/>
him, and we are happiest when we are <lb/>
together."</p>
<p>Devoted wife and mother though she <lb/>
was, Louise yet found time to keep in touch <lb/>
with affairs of state and, more than once, <lb/>
managed to aid her husband valiantly <lb/>
in some great crisis. Her tact was <reg orig="re-|sponsible">responsible</reg> <lb/>
for the alliance of Russia with <lb/>
them against Napoleon.</p>
<p>Alexander visited the King and Queen <lb/>
<pb n="26" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0079"/>
for ten days. At dinner, on the evening <lb/>
of his departure, he expressed regret that <lb/>
he had not yet seen the tomb of Frederick <lb/>
the Great.</p>
<p>"There is time," said Louise. She <lb/>
ordered the church to be lighted, and, at <lb/>
midnight, with her husband and the <lb/>
Emperor of Russia, went to the plain <lb/>
zinc coffin. Bending, Alexander kissed <lb/>
the coffin, then, offering his hand to the <lb/>
King, pledged eternal friendship to him and <lb/>
to his house, against Napoleon and all the <lb/>
world. Napoleon, hearing of it, said, softly: <lb/>
"The King of Prussia shall pay for this."</p>
<p>He spoke truly, for the King of Prussia <lb/>
paid heavily. Little more than a year <lb/>
later, the King and Queen, with their <lb/>
children, were obliged to flee before the <lb/>
approaching army of France. One night, <lb/>
the Queen slept in a fireless room with <lb/>
broken windows and the snow drifted <lb/>
thickly over her bed.</p>
<pb n="27" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0080"/>
<p>Napoleon went to Berlin, and took <reg orig="occa-|sion">occasion</reg> <lb/>
to stand, also, by the zinc coffin where <lb/>
Prussia and Russia had allied themselves <lb/>
against him. Reminiscently, he traced <lb/>
an N in the dust which lay heavily upon <lb/>
the coffin, saying: "If he were alive, I <lb/>
should not be standing here." At <reg orig="Char-|lottenburg">Charlottenburg</reg>, <lb/>
he went into the Queen's <lb/>
private apartments and even stooped to <lb/>
amuse himself by reading her letters. <lb/>
In some of them, he found allusions to <lb/>
himself which were far from <reg orig="compliment-|ary">complimentary</reg>, <lb/>
yet he took great interest in the many <lb/>
likenesses of the Queen which were about <lb/>
the house, and said he should like to see <lb/>
her.</p>
<p>When the two met, it was under tragic <lb/>
circumstances. The King was unable to <lb/>
obtain much for Prussia, and Alexander <lb/>
suggested that the Queen might be able <lb/>
to do better with Napoleon. When the <lb/>
King sent for her, Louise burst into tears, <lb/>
<pb n="28" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0081"/>
exclaiming: "This is the most painful <lb/>
sacrifice that I can make for my people."</p>
<p>Napoleon sent an escort for her, and <lb/>
when she reached Tilsit, he and Talleyrand <lb/>
at once called upon her. Louise, gowned <lb/>
in white embroidered cr&ecirc;pe, pleaded that <lb/>
some of the fortresses might be spared to <lb/>
Prussia, especially Magdeburg. "You ask <lb/>
much," said Napoleon, "but I will think <lb/>
about it."</p>
<p>Afterward he said that he was prepared <lb/>
to see a beautiful woman and a Queen with <lb/>
dignified manners, but he found the most <lb/>
admirable Queen and at the same time, the <lb/>
most interesting woman he had ever met.</p>
<p>Still, Napoleon yielded nothing, and <lb/>
Louise said, afterward: "What I suffered <lb/>
then I suffered more on account of others <lb/>
than on my own account. I wept, I <lb/>
implored in the name of love and humanity, <lb/>
in the name of our misfortunes, and of the <lb/>
laws which govern the world."</p>
<pb n="29" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0082"/>
<p>She gave the gold dinner service of <lb/>
Prussia to be coined into money, and all <lb/>
of her jewels save her pearls. "I will keep <lb/>
these," she said, "for they mean tears <lb/>
and I have shed many."</p>
<p>Worn by frequent child-bearing, heavily <lb/>
oppressed by the sorrows of Prussia's <lb/>
agonising defeat, Louise lived but three <lb/>
years longer. The deep and lasting joy <lb/>
of her life, her husband's love, still <reg orig="sus-|tained">sustained</reg> <lb/>
and comforted her. These two <lb/>
walked in the gardens at twilight, arm in <lb/>
arm, planning relief for the poor and new <lb/>
glory for Prussia, when the terror and <lb/>
weakness of the war should have passed <lb/>
away.</p>
<p>On her last visit to her father, she showed <lb/>
some ladies-in-waiting the locket which <lb/>
she wore, containing her husband's picture. <lb/>
"It is my dearest treasure," she said, <lb/>
fondly, kissing the pictured face. Then <lb/>
she sat down at her father's writing desk <lb/>
<pb n="30" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0083"/>
and wrote what were destined to be her <lb/>
last written words:</p>
<p>"My dear father&mdash;I am very happy <lb/>
to-day as your daughter and as the wife <lb/>
of the best of men."</p>
<p>She died in July, 1810, eager to the last <lb/>
to spare those she loved. She begged <lb/>
the King not to be so agitated, and asked <lb/>
her children not to grieve. "I am dying," <lb/>
she said, calmly. "Oh, Jesus, make it <lb/>
easy!" She drew a long breath, and closed <lb/>
her eyes forever.</p>
<p>All Germany mourned her and Bl&uuml;cher <lb/>
said: "Our saint is in heaven." Four <lb/>
years later, when the allied armies went <lb/>
triumphantly into Paris, he said: "Louise <lb/>
is avenged."</p>
<p>The familiar portrait shows a woman of <lb/>
regal bearing, with a noble, womanly <lb/>
face, coming down a flight of stairs. One <lb/>
hand is at her breast, the other holds the <lb/>
velvet and ermine mantle which seems to <lb/>
<pb n="31" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0084"/>
be slipping off. A blown scarf of chiffon <lb/>
floats from her perfect throat; the lips <lb/>
are composed, but the eyes smile. One <lb/>
has only to look once at the pictured face <lb/>
to understand it all&mdash;the adoration of the <lb/>
husband, the worship of the children, <lb/>
and the loyalty of a nation.</p>

Dorothy."</p>
<p>She was born on Christmas Day, 1771, <lb/>
and, fittingly, christened Dorothea, which <lb/>
means "the gift of God." When she was <lb/>
six, her mother died, and, at twelve, her <lb/>
father. At her mother's death, she was <lb/>
separated from her dearly loved brother, <lb/>
William, who was but twenty months her <lb/>
senior, and sent to live with her <reg orig="grand-|father">grandfather</reg>. <lb/>
They were deprived of each other's <lb/>
society, save for an occasional meeting, for <lb/>
several years, but did not forget each other.</p>
<p>The happiness of the first childish years <lb/>
<pb n="36" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0089"/>
together is evident in many of <reg orig="Words-|worth's">Wordsworth's</reg> <lb/>
poems. <lb/>

<p>After Wordsworth's college education <lb/>
was finished, and he was looking for a <lb/>
congenial occupation, a small legacy, from <lb/>
an unlooked-for source, enabled them to <lb/>
live together in a little cottage. He was <lb/>
<pb entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0090"/>
<figure id="f4" rend="page" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0090">
<head>Dorothy Wordsworth</head>
<p>From the painting by W.Crowbent</p>
</figure>
<pb entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0091"/>
<pb n="37" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0092"/>
still uncertain as to his life-work, and <lb/>
greatly troubled by the terrible events in <lb/>
France. "Depressed and bewildered, he <lb/>
turned to abstract science, and was <reg orig="be-|ginning">beginning</reg> <lb/>
to torment his mind with fresh <lb/>
problems, when, after his long voyage <lb/>
through unknown seas in search of Utopia, <lb/>
his sister came to his aid and conducted <lb/>
him back to the quiet harbour from which <lb/>
he started. &hellip; Then she convinced <lb/>
him that he was born to be a poet."</p>
<p>As Wordsworth himself says, she "<reg orig="main-|tained">maintained</reg> <lb/>
for me a saving intercourse with <lb/>
my true self &hellip; she, in the midst of all, <lb/>
preserved me still a poet; made me seek <lb/>
beneath that name, and that alone, my <lb/>
office upon earth."</p>
<p>Their means were small and Dorothy <lb/>
cheerfully undertook the hard household <lb/>
work. She scrubbed, cooked, swept, <lb/>
washed, sewed, mended, ironed, read <lb/>
Italian, and suggested subjects for her <lb/>
<pb n="38" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0093"/>
brother to write about. Moreover, she was <lb/>
his amanuensis and copied out, laboriously, <lb/>
"in a fair hand," all of his manuscript. <lb/>
When the work was finished, and, <reg orig="author-|like">author-like</reg>, <lb/>
he made changes in it, Dorothy <lb/>
copied it again, and yet again, until he was <lb/>
entirely satisfied.</p>
<p>In their cottage, poor as it was, they did <lb/>
not lack for friends. There began their <lb/>
lifelong friendship with Coleridge, who, in <lb/>
a letter to Mr. Cottle, said:</p>
<p>"Wordsworth and his exquisite sister <lb/>
are with me. She is a woman, indeed!&mdash; <lb/>
in mind, I mean, and heart; for her person <lb/>
is such that if you expected to see a pretty <lb/>
woman, you would find her ordinary; <lb/>
if you expected to find an ordinary woman, <lb/>
you would think her pretty; but her <lb/>
manners are simple, ardent, impressive. <lb/>
In every motion her most innocent soul <lb/>
outbeams so brightly that those who saw <lb/>
her would say 'guilt was a thing impossible <lb/>
<pb n="39" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0094"/>
in her.' Her information various, her <lb/>
eye watchful in minutest observation of <lb/>
Nature, and her taste a perfect <reg orig="electro-|meter">electrometer</reg>. <lb/>
It bends, protrudes, and draws in <lb/>
at subtlest beauties and most recondite <lb/>
faults."</p>
<p>In 1797, they changed their residence <lb/>
in order to be near Coleridge, and settled <lb/>
at Alfoxden, in a more pretentious house. <lb/>
Soon afterward, they met Charles and <lb/>
Mary Lamb, and the two devoted sisters <lb/>
became the closest of friends.</p>
<p>After the Wordsworths' removal to <lb/>
Grasmere, the poet's great period of <reg orig="in-|dustry">industry</reg> <lb/>
and fruition may be said to have <lb/>
fairly begun. As his amanuensis, Dorothy <lb/>
was always within reach of her brother's <lb/>
call, and the housekeeping was made <lb/>
subject to his need of her. When he was <lb/>
not ready to use her willing pen, she <reg orig="per-|formed">performed</reg> <lb/>
her cheerful drudgery, singing as <lb/>
she did it, and worked in the garden. <lb/>
<pb n="40" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0095"/>
In the orchard, where there was a spring <lb/>
of clear, cool water, she planted <reg orig="prim-|roses">primroses</reg> <lb/>
and daffodils around the brink "to <lb/>
sweeten the water." From a legacy of <lb/>
five hundred dollars which came to her, <lb/>
she furnished the cottage, simply, yet <lb/>
comfortably.</p>
<p>"My sister and I were in the habit of <lb/>
having the tea-kettle in our little <reg orig="sitting-|room">sitting-room</reg>," <lb/>
wrote Wordsworth, "and we toasted <lb/>
the bread ourselves." Dorothy herself <lb/>
testified abundantly to the happiness of <lb/>
their simple life here: "We are daily <lb/>
more delighted with Grasmere and its <lb/>
neighbourhood. &hellip; Our cottage is quite <lb/>
large enough for us, though very small, <lb/>
and we have made it neat and <reg orig="comfort-|able">comfortable</reg> <lb/>
within doors, and it looks very nice <lb/>
on the outside. &hellip; We have trained <lb/>
scarlet beans upon threads, which are not <lb/>
only exceedingly beautiful but very <reg orig="use-|ful">useful</reg>, <lb/>
as their produce is immense. We <lb/>
<pb n="41" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0096"/>
have made a lodging room of the parlour <lb/>
below stairs which has a stone floor, <lb/>
therefore we have covered it all over with <lb/>
matting. We sit in a room above stairs, <lb/>
and we have one lodging room, with two <lb/>
single beds, a sort of lumber room, and a <lb/>
small, low, unceiled room, which I have <lb/>
papered with newspapers, and in which <lb/>
we have put a small bed. Our servant <lb/>
is an old woman of sixty years of age, whom <lb/>
we took partly out of charity. She is <lb/>
very ignorant, very foolish, and very <lb/>
difficult to teach. But the goodness of <lb/>
her disposition, and the great convenience <lb/>
we should find if my perseverance was <lb/>
successful, induced me to go on."</p>
<p>Their life here was a living illustration <lb/>
of the phrase, "plain living and high <lb/>
thinking." Of the "high thinking," there <lb/>
is a great deal of evidence in Dorothy's <reg orig="jour-|nal">journal</reg>, <lb/>
and also, though entirely unconscious, <lb/>
of her continued assistance to her brother.</p>
<pb n="42" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0097"/>
<p>"We went into the orchard after <reg orig="break-|fast">breakfast</reg> <lb/>
and sat there. The lake calm, the <lb/>
sky cloudy. William began poem on <lb/>
'The Celandine.' &hellip; Sowed flower seeds. <lb/>
William helped me. Sat in the orchard. <lb/>
W. wrote 'The Celandine.' Planned an <lb/>
arbour, the sun too hot for us. W. wrote <lb/>
the 'Leech Gatherer.'"</p>
<p>She read Milton's sonnets to her brother <lb/>
and he was forthwith inspired to learn the <lb/>
difficult form and to write some noteworthy <lb/>
sonnets himself. The lines <hi rend="italic">To a Young <lb/>
Lady</hi>, who had been reproached for <lb/>
taking long walks in the country, were <lb/>
written to Dorothy in this same beautiful <lb/>
orchard.</p>
<p>Three years passed&mdash;blessed, happy, <lb/>
working years, then Wordsworth married. <lb/>
Fortunately, his wife was a woman whom <lb/>
Dorothy found it possible to love, and she <lb/>
continued her gentle ministry to her <lb/>
brother as before.</p>
<pb n="43" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0098"/>
<p>The year following the marriage, <reg orig="Words-|worth">Wordsworth</reg> <lb/>
and Dorothy took their memorable <lb/>
six weeks' tour in Scotland. Dorothy <lb/>
kept a minute journal which was <reg orig="eventu-|ally">eventually</reg> <lb/>
published, though nearly twenty <lb/>
years after her death. For the first two <lb/>
weeks, Coleridge accompanied them, <lb/>
though he was said to be "in bad spirits <lb/>
and somewhat too much in love with his <lb/>
own dejection."</p>
<p>During this tour, the Wordsworths <lb/>
visited Walter Scott, who was then, <lb/>
"unknown as a novelist, but who, as <lb/>
Sheriff of Selkirk, and considered a very <lb/>
clever and amiable man, was universally <lb/>
respected."</p>
<p>After their return, the happy life at <lb/>
Grasmere continued, until sadly broken <lb/>
by the death of two of Wordsworth's <lb/>
children. Being so near the churchyard <lb/>
that they were constantly reminded of <lb/>
their loss, the Wordsworths moved, in <lb/>
<pb n="44" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0099"/>
1813, to Rydal Mount, where they <reg orig="re-|mained">remained</reg> <lb/>
for the rest of their lives. An <reg orig="ap-|preciative">appreciative</reg> <lb/>
guest spoke of a tea-party at <lb/>
Rydal Mount as "perhaps the highest point <lb/>
in man's civilised life, in all its bearings."</p>
<p>For almost twenty years the beautiful <lb/>
life of study and work and travel continued, <lb/>
then Dorothy had a long and severe <lb/>
illness, from which she emerged with a <lb/>
sorely weakened body and mind <reg orig="per-|manently">permanently</reg> <lb/>
clouded. During this illness <lb/>
Wordsworth said of her that he did not <lb/>
believe her tenderness of heart was <reg orig="ex-|ceeded">exceeded</reg> <lb/>
by any of God's creatures; that <lb/>
her loving-kindness knew no bounds. <reg orig="Re-|ferring">Referring</reg> <lb/>
to Coleridge, he wrote: "He and <lb/>
my beloved sister are the two beings to <lb/>
whom my intellect is most indebted and <lb/>
they are now proceeding, <hi rend="italic">pari passu</hi>, <lb/>
along the path of sickness, I will not say <lb/>
towards the grave, but I trust towards <lb/>
a blessed immortality."</p>
<pb n="45" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0100"/>
<p>Yet Dorothy survived her brother. <lb/>
He died in 1850, on April 23d, the <reg orig="anni-|versary">anniversary</reg> <lb/>
of Shakespeare's birth and death. <lb/>
The mental fog, like a merciful veil, shielded <lb/>
Dorothy from the devastating grief she <lb/>
would have known had her brilliant <reg orig="in-|tellect">intellect</reg> <lb/>
remained clear. She was drawn <lb/>
about as usual in her wheeled chair, and, <lb/>
in passing the room where her brother's <lb/>
body lay, she murmured: "O death, <lb/>
where is thy sting? O grave, where is <lb/>
thy victory?"</p>
<p>The rest of her days were spent quietly, <lb/>
dreaming a little, sleeping much, and <lb/>
talking scarcely at all. She usually had <lb/>
one of her brother's books in her hand, <lb/>
stroking and patting the printed page <lb/>
when she was unable to read.</p>
<p>When she spoke, it was most often of <lb/>
her youth: "a youth of beauty and <lb/>
buoyancy and joy, because so full of love <lb/>
and goodness, of generous sympathy and <lb/>
<pb n="46" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0101"/>
unselfish devotion&mdash;a youth which she <lb/>
has since renewed unclouded by any shade, <lb/>
in the same old society, and with the <lb/>
familiar love re-linked, in Paradiso."</p>

<p>"<hi rend="small-caps">I am</hi> nothing, I have done nothing; all I <lb/>
am, all I know, I owe to my brother. <lb/>
I am only a tool which he shaped to his <lb/>
use&mdash;a well-trained puppy dog would have <lb/>
done as much."</p>
<p>So wrote Caroline Herschel of herself, <lb/>
her marvellous sister-love, self-denying <lb/>
and almost abject, inspiring her to <reg orig="dis-|claim">disclaim</reg> <lb/>
all honour, that her beloved brother <lb/>
might have all the glory of their joint <lb/>
fame.</p>
<p>Yet Mr. South, addressing the <reg orig="Astro-|nomical">Astronomical</reg> <lb/>
Society, when the medal was <lb/>
presented to her in 1828, said: "She it <lb/>
was who reduced every observation, made <lb/>
every calculation; she it was who arranged <lb/>
everything in systematic order; and she <lb/>
<pb n="50" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0105"/>
it was who helped him to obtain his <lb/>
imperishable name. But her claims to our <lb/>
gratitude do not end here; as an original <lb/>
observer she demands, and I am sure <lb/>
she has, our unfeigned thanks." After <lb/>
enumerating her discoveries, Mr. South <lb/>
added: "Indeed, looking at the joint <lb/>
labours of these extraordinary personages, <lb/>
we scarcely know whether most to admire <lb/>
the intellectual power of the brother, or <lb/>
the unconquerable industry of his sister."</p>
<p>She was born in Hanover, Germany, <lb/>
in 1750, and brought up in the narrowest <lb/>
possible manner. The serious <reg orig="occupa-|tions">occupations</reg> <lb/>
of her life, in addition to housework, <lb/>
were "sewing, ornamental needlework, <lb/>
knitting, plaiting hair, and stringing beads <lb/>
and bugles." These activities, at that <lb/>
time, were the only ones considered proper <lb/>
for women.</p>
<p>"It was my lot," she once wrote, "to <lb/>
be the Cinderella of the family. I could <lb/>

never find time for improving myself in <lb/>
many things I knew, and which, after all, <lb/>
proved of no use to me afterward, except <lb/>
what little I knew of music, which my <lb/>
father took pleasure in teaching me&mdash; <lb/>
N. B., when my mother was not at home. <lb/>
Amen."</p>
<p>Yet these troubled years were happy, <lb/>
illumined as they were by a great love. <lb/>
From childhood, Caroline's hero, her king <lb/>
who could do no wrong, was her brother <lb/>
William, twelve years her senior. She <lb/>
was happiest when she could be of service <lb/>
to him, and the unceasing joy of her life <lb/>
lay in her unswerving devotion to him and <lb/>
his interests.</p>
<p>William Herschel first went to England <lb/>
as a member of a band under his father's <lb/>
direction. The tour was successful, and <lb/>
was repeated. Finally, William <reg orig="estab-|lished">established</reg> <lb/>
himself as a music teacher at Bath.</p>
<p>The father died when Caroline was <lb/>
<pb n="52" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0109"/>
seventeen, and the family was left without <lb/>
means. Cinderella's lot became <reg orig="increas-|ingly">increasingly</reg> <lb/>
difficult. After five years of toil <lb/>
and privation, William came unexpectedly <lb/>
from Bath, and took Caroline back to <lb/>
England with him.</p>
<p>The hard work continued, but who <lb/>
minds hard work, when the Bird of Joy <lb/>
is singing in the heart? Caroline toiled <lb/>
early and late for her beloved William, <lb/>
keeping his house, thriftily managing his <lb/>
purse, arranging his accounts, collecting <lb/>
from his music pupils, and, at night, <lb/>
"minding the heavens" for him.</p>
<p>Every room in the little house became <lb/>
a workshop where telescopes and other <lb/>
astronomical instruments were in process <lb/>
of manufacture. Once, when he was <lb/>
working at a seven-foot mirror for his <lb/>
telescope, never pausing to rest for over <lb/>
sixteen hours, the faithful Caroline put <lb/>
bits of food into his mouth while he worked.</p>
<pb n="53" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0110"/>
<p>At the time he began his work, six or <lb/>
eight inches was the largest-sized mirror <lb/>
used in a telescope. When they were <lb/>
casting the mirror for a thirty-foot <reg orig="re-|flector">reflector</reg>, <lb/>
the molten metal leaked from the <lb/>
vessel containing it and, falling upon the <lb/>
stone floor, sent pieces flying about in all <lb/>
directions. William Herschel, overcome <lb/>
by disappointment and weariness, fell, <lb/>
exhausted, upon a "heap of brickbats." <lb/>
"Come," said Caroline, cheerily; "we will <lb/>
try again." Fortunately, the second <reg orig="cast-|ing">casting</reg> <lb/>
was a success.</p>
<p>Having naturally a good voice and <lb/>
being carefully trained by her brother, <lb/>
Caroline eventually appeared as a public <lb/>
singer and made some money which she <lb/>
devoted to her brother's needs. She <lb/>
regarded her voice only as a possible <lb/>
means of setting him free from some of <lb/>
the eternal music-teaching, and enabling <lb/>
him to continue his astronomical work.</p>
<pb n="54" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0111"/>
<p>She spent scarcely anything on herself&mdash; <lb/>
seldom more than thirty-five or forty <lb/>
dollars a year. Orders came in rapidly <lb/>
for telescopes from learned societies in <lb/>
England and abroad, but, while William <lb/>
realised a fair profit from every telescope, <lb/>
Caroline begrudged the time thus spent.</p>
<p>In 1782, William Herschel was appointed <lb/>
Astronomer Royal by King George III, <lb/>
at a salary of a thousand dollars a year. <lb/>
Greatly elated, the two left Bath, and <reg orig="set-|tled">settled</reg> <lb/>
in the country. All day they worked <lb/>
at instruments and every night they <lb/>
studied the heavens, resenting the <reg orig="en-|forced">enforced</reg> <lb/>
rest caused by an occasional cloudy <lb/>
night.</p>
<p>Caroline by this time had a telescope <lb/>
of her own, which she called "a seven-foot <lb/>
Newtonian sweeper," and all her evenings, <lb/>
when her brother did not require her <lb/>
assistance, were spent in "sweeping the <lb/>
heavens for comets." She wrote down <lb/>
<pb n="55" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0112"/>
all of his observations as he made them, <lb/>
though sometimes it was so cold that the <lb/>
ink froze and had to be thawed before she <lb/>
could continue.</p>
<p>The great forty-foot telescope was <lb/>
erected under their personal direction, and <lb/>
the astronomer's salary was supplemented <lb/>
by a special grant. At this time, too, <reg orig="Caro-|line">Caroline</reg> <lb/>
was appointed her brother's assistant, <lb/>
at a salary of two hundred and fifty dollars <lb/>
a year, which, however, was not regularly <lb/>
paid. After her brother's death, she wrote <lb/>
one, sarcastically: "The favours of <reg orig="mon-|archs">monarchs</reg> <lb/>
ought to have been mentioned, but <lb/>
once would have been enough."</p>
<p>In 1788, William married, greatly to <lb/>
Caroline's grief. She threw herself into <lb/>
her work with renewed energy and <reg orig="am-|bition">ambition</reg>. <lb/>
Between 1786 and 1797, she <reg orig="dis-|covered">discovered</reg> <lb/>
eight comets, and was recognised <lb/>
as a comrade by all the leading astronomers <lb/>
of Europe, many of whom took the trouble <lb/>
<pb n="56" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0113"/>
to write her congratulatory letters upon <lb/>
her achievements.</p>
<p>One wrote as follows: "I wish you joy, <lb/>
most sincerely, on the discovery. I am <lb/>
more pleased than you can well conceive, <lb/>
that you have made it, and I think I <lb/>
see your wonderfully clever and amiable <lb/>
brother, upon the news of it, shed a tear of <lb/>
joy. You have immortalised your name. <lb/>
You deserve such a reward from the <lb/>
Being who has ordered all these things to <lb/>
move as we find them, for your assiduity <lb/>
in the business of astronomy, and for your <lb/>
love for so celebrated and deserving a <lb/>
brother."</p>
<p>On one occasion, the Prince of Orange <lb/>
called at their house to know if it were <lb/>
true that Mr. Herschel had "discovered a <lb/>
new star, whose light was not as that of <lb/>
the common stars, but with swallow tails, <lb/>
as stars in embroidery." This probably <lb/>
referred to Caroline's comet, and the idea <lb/>
<pb n="57" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0114"/>
of a "star with embroidered swallow tails" <lb/>
amused her immensely.</p>
<p>In 1822, after having been in ill health <lb/>
for three years, Sir William Herschel died&mdash; <lb/>
and poor Caroline's faithful heart was <lb/>
almost broken. "Not one comfort was <lb/>
left to me," she wrote, long afterward, <lb/>
"but that of retiring to the chamber of <lb/>
death, there to ruminate without <reg orig="interrup-|tion">interruption</reg> <lb/>
on my isolated situation." Pitifully <lb/>
she moaned, over and over, "Oh, why <lb/>
cannot I die too!"</p>
<p>Lamenting that she had "nothing to do," <lb/>
she arranged to leave England and return <lb/>
to her relatives in Germany, expecting, <lb/>
vainly, to find them sympathetic. <reg orig="Ap-|parently">Apparently</reg>, <lb/>
the relatives were unconscious <lb/>
of the fact that there were astronomers <lb/>
in the family, or that any Herschel, except <lb/>
themselves, had accomplished anything <lb/>
really worth while.</p>
<p>Disappointed, Caroline asked herself <lb/>
<pb n="58" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0115"/>
over and over: "Why did I leave happy <lb/>
England!" She was seventy-two, and, <lb/>
old trees are not easily transplanted, but <lb/>
eventually her courage and strength <reg orig="re-|asserted">reasserted</reg> <lb/>
themselves, and she began a long <lb/>
labour of love. She wrote, in the form of a <lb/>
catalogue, <hi rend="italic">The Reduction and Arrangement <lb/>
in Zones of all the Star Clusters and <lb/>
Nebul&aelig; Observed by Sir William Herschel <lb/>
in his Sweeps.</hi> When this was completed, <lb/>
the gold medal of the Royal Astronomical <lb/>
Society was awarded to her.</p>
<p>Afterward, she devoted herself to her <lb/>
nephew, Sir John Herschel, the third <lb/>
great astronomer of the name. When he <lb/>
wrote to her, in 1832, of his intention to <lb/>
visit the Cape and observe the stars in <lb/>
the Southern Hemisphere, she was <reg orig="in-|credulous">incredulous</reg>; <lb/>
it did not seem as if such things <lb/>
could be. But, when finally convinced of <lb/>
it, the old fever burned in her cheeks and <lb/>
the old joy sang in her blood. "Oh," <lb/>
<pb n="59" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0116"/>
she cried, "if I were thirty or forty years <lb/>
younger, and could go too!'</p>
<p>She lived to be ninety-eight, spending <lb/>
only about half of the annuity of five <reg orig="hund-|red">hundred</reg> <lb/>
dollars a year left her by her brother. <lb/>
She continually asserted that she could <lb/>
not use more without "making herself <lb/>
ridiculous." Her only luxuries were an <lb/>
English bed and an occasional ticket to <lb/>
opera or concert.</p>
<p>She died quietly, in her sleep, with no <lb/>
pain. Court carriages joined in her funeral <lb/>
procession and garlands of laurel and <lb/>
palm were sent by the Crown Princess. <lb/>
But, unmindful of these Royal honours, <lb/>
in the narrow house where at last she <lb/>
slept, the work-worn, loving hands clasped <lb/>
but one treasure&mdash;a lock of her beloved <lb/>
brother's hair.</p>
<p>Her nephew writes that her last days <lb/>
were "unquiet." Feeling, perhaps, that <lb/>
the time of change was near, one cannot <lb/>
<pb n="60" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0117"/>
wonder that she grew impatient, and <lb/>
longed to join him whom she loved with <lb/>
the beautiful, unselfish devotion, which, <lb/>
as much as her scientific work, has made <lb/>
the name of Caroline Herschel immortal.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> first fifteen years of Elizabeth <lb/>
Barrett's life were as joyous as ever <lb/>
falls to the lot of mortal. She was one of <lb/>
a large family of children, with a brother <lb/>
particularly singled out for loving <reg orig="compan-|ionship">companionship</reg>, <lb/>
she had a father who idolised her, <lb/>
even though he was stern and obstinate, <lb/>
and all the comforts and luxuries that <lb/>
wealth could procure for her.</p>
<p>Before she was eleven, she had written <lb/>
"an epic" upon <hi rend="italic">The Battle of Marathon</hi> <lb/>
and Mr. Barrett was so proud of it that <lb/>
he had it printed in pamphlet form to <lb/>
distribute among his friends. Elizabeth's <lb/>
grandmother was not so pleased with it, <lb/>
and used to say she would rather "see <lb/>
Elizabeth's hemming more carefully <reg orig="fin-|ished">finished</reg> <lb/>
than to hear of all this Greek."</p>
<pb n="64" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0121"/>
<p>At fifteen, she tried to saddle her pony <lb/>
alone, being impatient for a ride, and, in <lb/>
some way, fell, with the saddle upon her, <lb/>
thus so seriously injuring her spine that <lb/>
for many years she was obliged to lie upon <lb/>
her back. She also had what she <reg orig="after-|ward">afterward</reg> <lb/>
alluded to as "a common cough, <lb/>
striking on an insubstantial frame." To <lb/>
this she attributed the beginning of all <lb/>
her physical troubles.</p>
<p>But, though the body was weak, the mind <lb/>
was strong and the spirit well-nigh <reg orig="death-|less">deathless</reg>. <lb/>
Through the loved ministry of books, <lb/>
she came into fellowship with all the world. <lb/>
Hugh Boyd, the blind scholar, taught her <lb/>
Greek, both the language and literature. In <lb/>
several of her poems, afterward, she <reg orig="grate-|fully">gratefully</reg> <lb/>
acknowledged her indebtedness to him.</p>

</lg></q>
<p>Confined to a darkened room though <lb/>
she was, Elizabeth Barrett did not lack for <lb/>
friends. John Kenyon, a distant cousin, <lb/>
and Miss Mitford, brought the outside <lb/>
world to her couch. Miss Mitford's <reg orig="beau-|tiful">beautiful</reg>, <lb/>
unfailing, enthusiastic friendship <lb/>
shines brightly through the sombre years <lb/>
which were the background of the <reg orig="lumi-|nous">luminous</reg> <lb/>
joy to come.</p>
<p>Miss Mitford described Miss Barrett <lb/>
thus:</p>
<p>"A slight, girlish figure, very delicate, <lb/>
with exquisite hands and feet, a round <lb/>
face, with a most noble forehead, a large <lb/>
mouth, beautifully formed and full of <lb/>
expression, lips like parted coral, teeth <lb/>
large, regular, and glittering with healthy <lb/>
whiteness, large dark eyes, with such <lb/>
<pb n="66" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0125"/>
eyelashes, resting on the cheek when cast <lb/>
down, when turned upward touching the <lb/>
flexible and expressive eyebrow, a dark <lb/>
complexion, literally as bright as the dark <lb/>
China rose, a profusion of silky, dark curls, <lb/>
and a look of youth and of modesty <lb/>
hardly to be expressed. This, added to the <lb/>
very simple but graceful and costly dress <lb/>
by which all the family are distinguished, <lb/>
is an exact portrait of her."</p>
<p>Besides her father, her books, and her <lb/>
friends, she had her dog, "Flush," an <lb/>
intelligent and devoted spaniel, who was <lb/>
so generally admired that he was stolen <lb/>
several times. As a reward of fifty dollars <lb/>
was offered every time he was stolen and <lb/>
paid whenever he was returned, the <reg orig="pur-|loining">purloining</reg> <lb/>
of Miss Barrett's pet in time <lb/>
assumed the proportions of an industry.</p>
<p>"Yes," she wrote, to a friend, "I have <lb/>
recovered my pet. No, I have idealised <lb/>
none of the dog stealing. I had no time. <lb/>
<pb n="67" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0126"/>
I was crying while he was away and I was <lb/>
accused so loudly of 'silliness and <reg orig="childish-|ness">childishness</reg>' <lb/>
afterwards, that I was glad to dry my <lb/>
eyes, and forget my misfortunes by way of <lb/>
rescuing my reputation. After all it was <lb/>
excusable that I cried. Flushie is my <lb/>
friend, my companion, and he loves me <lb/>
better than he loves the sunshine without. <lb/>
Oh, and if you had seen him when he came <lb/>
home and threw himself into my arms, <lb/>
palpitating with joy, in that dumb <reg orig="articu-|late">articulate</reg> <lb/>
ecstasy which is so affecting, love <lb/>
without speech! &hellip; He is worth loving, <lb/>
is he not?"</p>
<p>Meantime Miss Barrett was succeeding, <lb/>
though slowly, in her chosen work. <reg orig="Ken-|yon">Kenyon</reg> <lb/>
and Miss Mitford interviewed <reg orig="pub-|lishers">publishers</reg> <lb/>
with her poems, and obtained good <lb/>
prices for some of them. The <reg orig="introspec-|tive">introspective</reg> <lb/>
life in the shadowy room was <reg orig="favour-|able">favourable</reg> <lb/>
to her literary development. "Most <lb/>
of my events," she said, "and nearly <lb/>
<pb n="68" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0127"/>
all my intense pleasures, have passed in <lb/>
thoughts."</p>
<p>Robert Browning, too, was becoming <lb/>
well known. Miss Barrett read all his <lb/>
published work eagerly, and he read hers. <lb/>
Though they had mutual friends, Miss <lb/>
Barrett refused to meet him, feeling too <lb/>
keenly the limitations of her darkened <lb/>
room. Yet, in some way, a correspondence <lb/>
sprang up between them.</p>
<p>"Mr. Browning, with whom I have had <lb/>
some correspondence lately," she wrote, "is <lb/>
full of great intentions; the light of the <lb/>
future is on his forehead &hellip; he is a poet <lb/>
for posterity. I have a full faith in him as <lb/>
poet and prophet."</p>
<p>At length, Browning prevailed upon the <lb/>
mutual friends to insist upon Miss Barrett's <lb/>
consent to their meeting. In fear and <lb/>
trembling, she accorded the desired <reg orig="per-|mission&mdash;and">permission&mdash;and</reg> <lb/>
from that hour, life took <lb/>
on new beauty for her.</p>
<pb n="69" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0128"/>
<p>They had not known each other long <lb/>
before they discovered that they were <lb/>
truly mated in mind and soul. Love <lb/>
came late to Elizabeth Barrett&mdash;she was <lb/>
nearly thirty-eight, but no maiden of <lb/>
eighteen could have been more exalted <lb/>
than she.</p>
<p>Into the sombre, shadowy room, and <lb/>
into the darkened, secret places of her <lb/>
soul, Love came with his lamp, and the <lb/>
radiance of it made her whole being glow <lb/>
with "the light that never was on land or <lb/>
sea." The tired heart, forgetting suffering, <lb/>
all at once was uplifted as if on wings <lb/>
when her king came to his own.</p>
<p>Her father, naturally, was much opposed <lb/>
to her marriage, but, grown to maturity <lb/>
and to full knowledge, she took her right of <lb/>
choice. One day, she stole out of the <lb/>
house, went to church with her lover, and <lb/>
was quietly married. Then she returned <lb/>
to her home, no one being the wiser for <lb/>
<pb n="70" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0129"/>
several days, during which she made her <lb/>
preparations for departure.</p>
<p>During the days she remained at home, <lb/>
Browning did not call upon her, or even <lb/>
write to her, as he "would not be hypocrite <lb/>
enough to ask for her or address her by <lb/>
her maiden name!"</p>
<p>Mr. Barrett, of course, made the <reg orig="cus-|tomary">customary</reg> <lb/>
scene, but his daughter was not <lb/>
unduly saddened by it, for love and life <lb/>
lay before her. They went at once to <lb/>
Italy, making the journey by easy stages, <lb/>
as Mrs. Browning's health permitted. <lb/>
But happiness has power of its own to heal, <lb/>
and soon she was stronger than she had <lb/>
been since her early girlhood.</p>
<p>They stopped for a fortnight in Paris <lb/>
at a quiet pension near their friend Mrs. <lb/>
Jameson, who wrote thus to a friend:</p>
<p>"I have also here a poet and a poetess&mdash; <lb/>
two celebrities who have run away and <lb/>
married under circumstances peculiarly <lb/>
<pb n="71" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0130"/>
interesting, and such as render imprudence <lb/>
the height of prudence. Both excellent; <lb/>
but God help them! for I know not <lb/>
how the two poet heads and poet hearts <lb/>
will get on through this prosaic world. <lb/>
I think it possible I may go on to Italy <lb/>
with them."</p>
<p>Mrs. Jameson went with them at the <lb/>
request of both, and when the party <lb/>
arrived at Pisa, Mrs. Browning was <lb/>
"not merely improved, but transformed." <lb/>
Even Miss Mitford said: "Love really is <lb/>
the wizard the poets have called him&mdash;a <lb/>
fact which I always doubted till now." <lb/>
The magic is evident when one considers <lb/>
that for more than seven years Mrs. <lb/>
Browning had not left her room, except <lb/>
to go into the one adjoining it.</p>
<p>The Brownings spent several months <lb/>
in Pisa, casting about meanwhile for a <lb/>
permanent residence. Mrs. Browning's <lb/>
health continued to improve. "If I get <lb/>
<pb n="72" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0131"/>
quite strong," she said, "I may cross the <lb/>
desert on a camel yet and see Jerusalem. <lb/>
There's a dream for you! Nothing <lb/>
is too high or too low for my dreams just <lb/>
now!"</p>
<p>Perhaps because of her dark hair and <lb/>
skin and deep, luminous eyes, Browning <lb/>
had often called her his "little Portuguese." <lb/>
One day, when he was writing, she came <lb/>
shyly into his room, laid a manuscript on <lb/>
the table before him, covered her burning <lb/>
face with her hands&mdash;and fled.</p>
<p>Wonderingly, he opened it&mdash;to find the <lb/>
most exquisite portrayal of woman's love <lb/>
ever written or ever to be written in any <lb/>
language, breathing the fragrance of a pure <lb/>
and holy passion, burning with the divine <lb/>
fires of immortality&mdash;the <hi rend="italic">Sonnets from the <lb/>
Portuguese.</hi> One wonders what he said <lb/>
to her when they met again&mdash;this <reg orig="lover-|husband">lover-husband</reg> <lb/>
who was also a poet.</p>
<p>Their life together was ideal. "A happier <lb/>
<pb n="73" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0132"/>
home and a more perfect union than <lb/>
theirs are not easy to imagine," wrote a <lb/>
guest. Speaking of Mrs. Browning, he <lb/>
said: "I have never seen a human frame <lb/>
which seemed so nearly a transparent <lb/>
veil for a celestial and immortal spirit. <lb/>
She is a soul of fire enclosed in a shell of <lb/>
pearl. &hellip; A union so complete as theirs, <lb/>
in which the mind has nothing to crave <lb/>
nor the heart to sigh for, is cordial to <lb/>
behold and cheering to remember."</p>
<p>Two and a half years after their marriage <lb/>
their son was born, and named Robert <lb/>
Barrett, after both parents. For twelve <lb/>
years longer this perfect marriage lasted, <lb/>
then the "shell of pearl" became too <lb/>
delicate to longer enshrine the "soul of <lb/>
fire," and she died.</p>
<p>Browning's grief was lifelong, even <lb/>
though "his heart was deep enough to <lb/>
hold a grave." Into the lonely years <lb/>
that followed must have come often, <lb/>
<pb n="74" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0133"/>
with divinely tender consolation, that <lb/>
most exquisite of all the <hi rend="italic">Sonnets:</hi> <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.</l>
<l rend="hang">I love thee to the depth and breadth and <lb/>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> woman who earned the right to be <lb/>
known as "the first great American <lb/>
actress" did not come easily to her proud <lb/>
distinction. A study of her career fills <lb/>
one with wonder at her genius, truly, but, <lb/>
even more, with respect for her years of <lb/>
patient, unflagging industry and the <reg orig="buoy-|ant">buoyant</reg> <lb/>
hopefulness with which she worked.</p>
<p>A latter-day philosopher has said: "Get <lb/>
your happiness out of your work, or you <lb/>
will never know what happiness is." <lb/>
The truth of it is strikingly evident in the <lb/>
life of the great Cushman, who was seen <lb/>
to be destined for great things even in her <lb/>
early childhood, and, through years of <lb/>
toil, reached the pinnacle of immortal <lb/>
fame.</p>
<pb n="78" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0137"/>
<p>"Imitation was a prevailing trait with <lb/>
me," she once said. "On one occasion, <lb/>
when Henry Ware, pastor of the old <lb/>
Boston Meeting House, was taking tea <lb/>
with my mother, he sat at table <reg orig="talk-|ing">talking</reg>, <lb/>
with his chin resting in his two <lb/>
hands and his elbows on the table. I was <lb/>
suddenly startled by my mother <reg orig="exclaim-|ing">exclaiming</reg>, <lb/>
'Charlotte, take your elbows off the <lb/>
table and your chin out of your hands; <lb/>
it is not a pretty position for a young lady!' <lb/>
I was sitting in exact imitation of the <lb/>
parson, even assuming the expression of <lb/>
his face."</p>
<p>Her passion for thoroughness and original <lb/>
investigation is also indicated very early <lb/>
in life. "My earliest recollections," she <lb/>
says, "are of dolls ruthlessly cracked open <lb/>
to see what they were thinking about; I <lb/>
was possessed with the idea that dolls <lb/>
could and did think."</p>
<p>As often happens, the family of the <lb/>
<pb entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0138"/>
<figure id="f7" rend="page" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0138">

<pb entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0139"/>
<pb n="79" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0140"/>
future actress was very poor. When <lb/>
Charlotte was thirteen, her father became <lb/>
unable to provide for them longer, even <lb/>
so scantily as had been his wont. The <lb/>
mother and five children suffered steadily <lb/>
from want, and Charlotte, as many a <lb/>
brave daughter has done before and since <lb/>
her time, avowed her intention of putting <lb/>
the family fortunes upon a firm basis.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the child had a voice. <lb/>
"It had almost two full registers, a full <lb/>
contralto and almost a full soprano, but <lb/>
the lower voice was the natural one." <lb/>
A friend loaned the money which enabled <lb/>
her to study for two years, for, as they <lb/>
thought then, music teaching was the <lb/>
only career open to her. A member of a <lb/>
piano firm gave her the use of a piano for <lb/>
practice in his salesroom&mdash;they were too <lb/>
poor to own one&mdash;and the young woman of <lb/>
fourteen began work with the same tireless, <lb/>
restless energy which characterised <reg orig="every-|thing">everything</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="80" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0141"/>
she did through all the rest of her <lb/>
life.</p>
<p>Before long, she was singing in opera <lb/>
in New Orleans. When she was nineteen, <lb/>
she made her professional d&eacute;but, and scored <lb/>
a success. But, too eager to make rapid <lb/>
progress, she worked too hard, overstrained <lb/>
&mdash;and ruined&mdash;her voice, and was thus <lb/>
left stranded.</p>
<p>Blessings are said to come in disguise, <lb/>
but this one was so heavily veiled that <lb/>
poor Charlotte could not penetrate its <lb/>
mystery. When the unhappy girl asked <lb/>
a New Orleans theatrical manager for <lb/>
advice, he told her, decisively, that she <lb/>
should be an actress, and not a singer. <lb/>
"If you will study a few dramatic parts," <lb/>
he said, "I will get Mr. Barton, the <reg orig="trage-|dian">tragedian</reg> <lb/>
of our theatre, to hear you and to take <lb/>
an interest in you."</p>
<p>Barton was so much impressed by her <lb/>
first effort that he engaged her to appear as <lb/>
<pb n="81" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0142"/>
Lady Macbeth when he appeared as <reg orig="Mac-|beth">Macbeth</reg> <lb/>
at his own benefit. Enraptured with <lb/>
the idea, she did not tell him she had no <lb/>
stage wardrobe until it was too late to <lb/>
secure anyone else to fill her place. Some <lb/>
of the clothing of the tragedienne of the <lb/>
French Theatre was lengthened and taken <lb/>
in to fit her, and, after much sewing, she <lb/>
was finally provided with a costume or two.</p>
<p>Before a brilliant audience, the young <lb/>
Lady Macbeth scored a complete triumph. <lb/>
At the end of the season, she started for <lb/>
New York. After a number of <reg orig="prelimin-|ary">preliminary</reg> <lb/>
discouragements, she secured a <reg orig="posi-|tion">position</reg> <lb/>
for three years at twenty-five dollars <lb/>
a week. But, a week before she was to <lb/>
make her first appearance, she had a <lb/>
severe attack of rheumatic fever, and <lb/>
missed the first three weeks of her season. <lb/>
She appeared when she was too ill to be <lb/>
out of bed, and, in spite of that, scored <lb/>
another success, fully satisfying her <reg orig="man-|ager">manager</reg>. <lb/>
<pb n="82" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0143"/>
But, while she was ill again, the <lb/>
theatre was burned, with her costumes, <lb/>
and all her brilliant prospects, as he said, <lb/>
"went up in smoke."</p>
<p>As soon as she was well enough to travel, <lb/>
she secured a situation in Albany. A <lb/>
writer of the period speaks of her thus, as <lb/>
she appeared at a ball: "In all the <reg orig="fresh-|ness">freshness</reg> <lb/>
and bloom of youth, magnificently <lb/>
attired, her head adorned with an immense <lb/>
and beautiful bird of paradise&mdash;as she <lb/>
threaded the mazes of the dance, or moved <lb/>
gracefully in the promenade, her stately <lb/>
form towering above her companions, she <lb/>
was 'the observed of all observers,' the <lb/>
bright, particular star of the evening."</p>
<p>During the winter in Albany, love came <lb/>
to Charlotte Cushman for the first and <lb/>
last time. Nothing is known of the affair <lb/>
except what she herself has written:</p>
<p>"There was a time in my life of girlhood <lb/>
when I thought I had been called upon to <lb/>
<pb n="83" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0144"/>
bear the very hardest thing that can come <lb/>
to a woman. Yet, if I had been spared this <lb/>
early trial, I should never have been so <lb/>
earnest and faithful in my art; I should <lb/>
still have been casting about for the <lb/>
'counterpart,' and not given my entire <lb/>
self to my work. God helped me in my <lb/>
art-isolation, and rewarded me for <reg orig="recog-|nising">recognising</reg> <lb/>
Him and helping myself. &hellip; My <lb/>
art, God knows, has never failed me, never <lb/>
failed to bring me rich reward, never failed <lb/>
to bring me comfort. I conquered my grief <lb/>
and myself. Labour saved me then and <lb/>
always, and so I proved the eternal <lb/>
goodness of God."</p>
<p>After seven years of hard work, steady <lb/>
devotion and sacrifice to her family, she <lb/>
came into her own. Accompanied only <lb/>
by her faithful coloured maid, "Sally," she <lb/>
went to England, and, after many <reg orig="difficul-|ties">difficulties</reg> <lb/>
in gaining a hearing, appeared at the <lb/>
Princess Theatre in London as Bianca in <lb/>
<pb n="84" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0145"/>
<hi rend="italic">Fazio.</hi> Her power and passion swept <lb/>
her staid English audience literally off its <lb/>
feet, and the theatre rang with cheers, <lb/>
curtain calls, and cries of "Bravo!"</p>
<p>Writing to her mother, she said: "By <lb/>
the packet of the 10th I wrote you and <lb/>
sent you newspapers, which could tell <lb/>
you in so much better language than I <lb/>
could, of my brilliant and triumphant <lb/>
success in London. I can say no more to <lb/>
you than this: that it is far, far beyond <lb/>
my most sanguine expectations. In my <lb/>
most ambitious moments I never dreamed <lb/>
of the success which has awaited me and <lb/>
crowned every effort I have made. &hellip; <lb/>
All my successes put together since I have <lb/>
been upon the stage would not come near <lb/>
my success in London; and I only wanted <lb/>
some one of you here to enjoy it with me <lb/>
to make my happiness complete."</p>
<p>The great men and women of the time <lb/>
were proud to be her friends. She gave <lb/>
<pb n="85" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0146"/>
a dinner to Ristori, knew the Carlyles, <lb/>
Lord Houghton, Lathrop, Motley, <reg orig="Theo-|dore">Theodore</reg> <lb/>
Parkman, and many lords and ladies <lb/>
of title and renown.</p>
<p>Among the innumerable parts which <lb/>
she played, she is remembered most for <lb/>
her Lady Macbeth, Romeo to her sister <lb/>
Susan's Juliet, Meg Merrilies, and Nancy <lb/>
Sikes. The latter portrayal was said to <lb/>
be so impressive in its powerful realism <lb/>
that women were often carried, fainting, <lb/>
from the theatre in which she played it, <lb/>
and strong men lay awake all night, after <lb/>
having seen it, with the horror of it still <lb/>
upon them.</p>
<p>Once, while she was playing Romeo in <lb/>
Boston, a young man in the audience, <lb/>
intending to be funny, sneezed several <lb/>
times during one of the love scenes. Miss <lb/>
Cushman led Juliet off the stage, then, <lb/>
clad in her doublet and hose, returned to <lb/>
the footlights and said, in a clear, ringing <lb/>
<pb n="86" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0147"/>
voice, "Someone must put that person <lb/>
out or I shall be obliged to do it myself." <lb/>
When the unfortunate man was put out, <lb/>
Romeo resumed her impassioned love scene, <lb/>
amid a storm of cheers.</p>
<p>When she first returned to America, after <lb/>
her English success, she was greeted with <lb/>
an ovation. From that time on, she was the <lb/>
star of the English-speaking stage. Deeply <lb/>
patriotic, she gave benefit performances <lb/>
during the War of the Rebellion, and one <lb/>
performance alone netted over eight <reg orig="thou-|sand">thousand</reg> <lb/>
dollars for the Sanitary Commisson.</p>
<p>In 1875, as Lady Macbeth, the part in <lb/>
which she scored her first success, Charlotte <lb/>
Cushman took her leave of the stage, <lb/>
before one of the most distinguished <lb/>
audiences ever gathered under one roof. <lb/>
The house was brilliantly decorated with <lb/>
autumn leaves, vines, fruits, and flowers, <lb/>
symbolising the maturity of her power and <lb/>
the ripeness of her fame.</p>
<pb n="87" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0148"/>
<p>William Cullen Bryant addressed her, <lb/>
presenting her with a laurel wreath. <reg orig="Rich-|ard">Richard</reg> <lb/>
Henry Stoddard had written an ode <lb/>
to her, in which he coupled her name with <lb/>
that of Shakespeare. Her response was <lb/>
simple, dignified, modest, and so full of <lb/>
feeling that many in the audience were <lb/>
moved to tears.</p>
<p>"Beggar that I am, I am even poor in <lb/>
thanks, but I thank you. Gentlemen, the <lb/>
heart has no speech; its only language is a <lb/>
tear or a pressure of the hand, and words <lb/>
very feebly convey or interpret its <reg orig="emo-|tions">emotions</reg>. <lb/>
Yet I would beg you to believe <lb/>
that in the three little words which I <lb/>
now speak, 'I thank you,' there are heart <lb/>
depths which I should fail to express <lb/>
better, though I should use a thousand <lb/>
other words.</p>
<p>"I thank you, gentlemen, for the honour <lb/>
you have offered me. I thank you, not only <lb/>
for myself, but for the whole profession, to <lb/>
<pb n="88" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0149"/>
which, through and by me, you have paid <lb/>
this very graceful compliment. &hellip;</p>
<p>"To my public&mdash;what shall I say? <lb/>
From the depths of my heart, I thank you, <lb/>
who have given me always consideration, <lb/>
encouragement, and patience; who have <lb/>
been ever my comfort, my support, my <lb/>
main help. I do not now say farewell <lb/>
to you in the usual sense of the word. <lb/>
In making my final representation of the <lb/>
mimic scene in the various cities of <lb/>
the country, I have reserved to myself the <lb/>
right of meeting you again where you <lb/>
have made me believe that I give you <lb/>
pleasure which I receive myself at the <lb/>
same time, at the reading desk. To you, <lb/>
then, I say, may you fare well and may I <lb/>
fare well, until at no distant day, we meet <lb/>
&mdash;there. Meanwhile, good, kind friends, <lb/>
good night, and God be with you."</p>

<p>"<hi rend="small-caps">Her</hi> carved image is worthy to stand <lb/>
with the greatest of our great who <lb/>
have died. Yet she has carved no statues, <lb/>
she has painted no great picture of <reg orig="his-|tory">history</reg>. <lb/>
She has not sung songs of <reg orig="immor-|tality">immortality</reg> <lb/>
&hellip; nor written books of raving <lb/>
eloquence, yet, though born nearly one <lb/>
hundred and thirty-five years ago, the <lb/>
name of Lucretia Mott still lives, by the <lb/>
simple force of her personality."</p>
<p>She was a native of the island of <reg orig="Nan-|tucket">Nantucket</reg>, <lb/>
and was descended from old <lb/>
Puritan stock. Her father, Thomas Coffin, <lb/>
was a leader among the Friends, and his <lb/>
gifted daughter received her early <reg orig="educa-|tion">education</reg> <lb/>
at "The Nine Partners," a Friends' <lb/>
boarding-school in Dutchess County, New <lb/>
<pb n="92" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0153"/>
York. It is said that she studied there <lb/>
for two years without even a day of <lb/>
vacation, except the quiet Quaker <reg orig="Sun-|days">Sundays</reg>, <lb/>
and, at fifteen, she was an assistant <lb/>
teacher in the school.</p>
<p>In another year, she became a <reg orig="full-|fledged">full-fledged</reg> <lb/>
teacher, working with her classes <lb/>
in the daytime and with her books, by a <lb/>
solitary candle, far into the night. She <lb/>
liked her work, and fully intended to be a <lb/>
teacher all her life, but Fate, as often, <lb/>
decreed otherwise.</p>
<p>Another teacher in the same school <lb/>
was James Mott, a young man belonging <lb/>
to a good Quaker family on Long Island. <lb/>
Cupid set up a school on his own account, <lb/>
taking these two as pupils, and, when <lb/>
Lucretia was nearly eighteen, and James <lb/>
was twenty, they were married.</p>
<p>In these days of what has been well <lb/>
termed "marital unrest," and when every <lb/>
daily paper teems with news of those who <lb/>
<pb entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0154"/>
<figure id="f8" rend="page" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0154">

have promised to take each other "for <lb/>
better, for worse," and, finding it to be <lb/>
"for worse," desire to retract their oaths <lb/>
and reassort themselves with other <reg orig="part-|ners">partners</reg>, <lb/>
it is refreshing to read of a marriage <lb/>
like that of Lucretia Mott.</p>
<p>Robert Collyer wrote of it thus: "If <lb/>
James and Lucretia had gone around the <lb/>
world in search of a mate, I think they <lb/>
would have made the choice that heaven <lb/>
made for them. They had lived together <lb/>
more than forty years when I first knew <lb/>
them. I thought then, as I think now, that <lb/>
it was the most perfect wedded life to be <lb/>
found on earth. They were both of a <lb/>
most beautiful presence. He, large, fair, <lb/>
with kindly blue eyes and regular features. <lb/>
She, slight, with dark eyes and hair. Both <lb/>
of the sunniest spirit; both free to take <lb/>
their own way, as such fine souls always <lb/>
are, yet their lives were so perfectly one <lb/>
that neither of them led or followed the <lb/>
<pb n="94" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0157"/>
other, so far as one could observe, by the <lb/>
breadth of a line."</p>
<p>They were, indeed, "perfectly one," <lb/>
and yet unselfish. Mrs. Mott once said <lb/>
to a friend: "James and I have loved each <lb/>
other more than ever since we worked <lb/>
together for a great cause."</p>
<p>Women who lament that their club and <lb/>
social duties leave them no time for the <lb/>
"cares" of home-keeping and home-<reg orig="mak-|ing">making</reg> <lb/>
may gather courage from the life of <lb/>
Lucretia Mott. She bore and reared six <lb/>
children, resigning their infancy to no <lb/>
hired hands. She sewed and cooked and <lb/>
washed, made rag carpets, and economised, <lb/>
even when there was no further need for <lb/>
economy.</p>
<p>It is recorded that she economised even <lb/>
upon letter-paper, that she might be able <lb/>
to save something more for the poor and <lb/>
unfortunate. A friend once received a <lb/>
letter from her written on scraps of paper <lb/>
<pb n="95" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0158"/>
less than three inches square, and written <lb/>
on both sides at that. This letter <reg orig="con-|tained">contained</reg> <lb/>
a hundred and fifty words and <lb/>
treated of seven distinct subjects. At <lb/>
the end was an apology for her unusual <lb/>
stationery, and five dollars was enclosed <lb/>
for a charitable object dear to the heart <lb/>
of the recipient of the letter.</p>
<p>This frail little woman, who weighed <lb/>
eighty pounds when she died, at eighty, <lb/>
seems to have been absolutely fearless. <lb/>
Her house was a refuge for runaway slaves, <lb/>
and men who would not have been <reg orig="per-|mitted">permitted</reg> <lb/>
to address a public audience found <lb/>
freedom of speech there. She assisted in <lb/>
forming the original Anti-Slavery Society <lb/>
of the United States, and three days after <lb/>
William Lloyd Garrison had been dragged <lb/>
through the streets of Boston, she <reg orig="ad-|dressed">addressed</reg> <lb/>
a meeting of Anti-Slavery women <lb/>
while bricks were being thrown through the <lb/>
windows of the hall, and, the next day, <lb/>
<pb n="96" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0159"/>
while a riot raged outside, she exhorted the <lb/>
members of the convention to be steadfast <lb/>
and solemn "in the prosecution of the <lb/>
business for which they were assembled."</p>
<p>One evening, the Anti-Slavery people <lb/>
were driven out of a public hall by a mob. <lb/>
In this time of peril, she told another <lb/>
woman to "take this friend's arm&mdash;he will <lb/>
protect thee from the mob." "But who <lb/>
will protect thee, Lucretia?" asked the <lb/>
other woman, anxiously. "This <reg orig="gentle-|man">gentleman</reg> <lb/>
will protect me," she answered, <reg orig="lay-|ing">laying</reg> <lb/>
her hand upon the arm of a ruffian in a <lb/>
red shirt who was suspected to be the <lb/>
leader of the mob. Much astonished, yet <lb/>
with his better nature roused by this <lb/>
appeal to his chivalry, the man did, <reg orig="in-|deed">indeed</reg>, <lb/>
"protect" her, and escort her safely <lb/>
through the mob to the door of her own <lb/>
home.</p>
<p>When she was twenty-five, she felt <lb/>
called to public life and engaged in the <lb/>
<pb n="97" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0160"/>
Quaker ministry. To a married clergyman <lb/>
who reminded her of St. Paul's caution <lb/>
to women to "keep silent in the churches," <lb/>
she said that St. Paul had also spoken in <lb/>
favour of a celibate clergy. This <reg orig="immedi-|ately">immediately</reg> <lb/>
silenced her would-be critic.</p>
<p>There is much eloquent testimony of <lb/>
her power as a preacher. For instance: <lb/>
"It was at a wood meeting up among the <lb/>
hills. She was well on in years then but <lb/>
the old fire still burned clear, and God's <lb/>
breath touched her out of heaven and <lb/>
she prophesied. &hellip; For two hours she <lb/>
held the multitude spellbound, waiting on <lb/>
her words. &hellip; I have said she <reg orig="prophe-|sied">prophesied</reg>. <lb/>
No other term would answer to <lb/>
her speech. Her eyes had 'seen the glory <lb/>
of the coming of the Lord' and she <reg orig="testi-|fied">testified</reg> <lb/>
of that she had seen; and this was all <lb/>
the more wonderful to me, because it was <lb/>
the habit of her mind in later years to <lb/>
reason from premise to conclusion. &hellip; <lb/>
<pb n="98" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0161"/>
But she had seen a vision sitting there in <lb/>
the August splendour, with the voice <reg orig="whis-|pering">whispering</reg> <lb/>
of God's presence in the trees, and <lb/>
the vision had sent the heart high above <lb/>
the brain."</p>
<p>One of the Friends of Philadelphia has <lb/>
recorded in his diary his impressions of her <lb/>
pulpit work:</p>
<p>"Eleventh Month, 1841. Evening <lb/>
meeting was much crowded. I should say <lb/>
more than two thousand persons assembled <lb/>
to hear Lucretia Mott deliver one of her <lb/>
most thrilling discourses previous to leaving <lb/>
the city on a religious visit.</p>
<p>"Sixth Month, 1842. Lucretia Mott <lb/>
was favoured to preach the Gospel to the <lb/>
heathen in an edifying manner. I am <lb/>
willing to bear witness to the savour of her <lb/>
testimony on my spirit, believing that she <lb/>
is commissioned to preach the Gospel as <lb/>
it is in Jesus.</p>
<p>"Second Month, 1845. That precious <lb/>
<pb n="99" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0162"/>
handmaid of the Lord, Lucretia Mott. <lb/>
Great has been her exercise and devotion <lb/>
in the cause of the slave; may her reward <lb/>
be sure. Thou precious lamb, thou hast <lb/>
known what it is to be in perils through <lb/>
false brethren and to be persecuted for <lb/>
righteousness' sake and thine is the <reg orig="king-|don">kingdon</reg> <lb/>
of heaven. Let me bear testimony <lb/>
to thy edifying discourses, and be <reg orig="per-|mitted">permitted</reg> <lb/>
to say that I believe thou art not <lb/>
far from the kingdom. Let this record <lb/>
stand to enduring generations. Amen.</p>
<p>"Third Month, 1846. Lucretia Mott <lb/>
occupied most of the meeting with an <lb/>
edifying discourse before eleven hundred <lb/>
people. Lucretia, thou beloved handmaid <lb/>
of the Lord! Great is thy faith and great <lb/>
are thy persecutions!"</p>
<p>Her husband gave up a lucrative <reg orig="busi-|ness">business</reg> <lb/>
because he would not handle the <lb/>
products of slave labour, and Mrs. Mott <lb/>
herself would not ride in any public <lb/>
<pb n="100" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0163"/>
conveyance that would not admit coloured <lb/>
people, nor eat nor use anything that was <lb/>
produced by those in helpless bondage.</p>
<p>In 1840, a World's Anti-Slavery <reg orig="Con-|vention">Convention</reg> <lb/>
was held in London, and women <lb/>
delegates were sent to it from Anti-Slavery <lb/>
societies in Boston, New York, and <lb/>
Philadelphia. They were refused <reg orig="admis-|sion">admission</reg> <lb/>
to the conference, as delegates, merely <lb/>
because they were women, thus stirring <lb/>
Lucretia Mott to a vigorous defence of <lb/>
her rights.</p>
<p>While seated at a breakfast table where <lb/>
a large company were gathered, many of <lb/>
them among those who had voted to <reg orig="ex-|clude">exclude</reg> <lb/>
women delegates from participation <lb/>
in the business of the convention, she arose <lb/>
in her place, unconventionally enough, <lb/>
and addressed them upon the subjects <lb/>
nearest her heart. They listened <reg orig="courte-|ously">courteously</reg> <lb/>
at first, but finally became interested. <lb/>
In alluding to this incident afterward, <lb/>
<pb n="101" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0164"/>
Emerson said: "I don't wonder Lady <lb/>
Byron liked her. She belongs to the <lb/>
aristocracy."</p>
<p>To the aristocracy of intellect she did, <lb/>
indeed, rightfully belong, but none the <lb/>
less she was of the common people, by <lb/>
choice. Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady <lb/>
Stanton called together the first Woman's <lb/>
Rights Convention in America, and began <lb/>
that plea for political equality which has <lb/>
not yet ceased.</p>
<p>Broad-minded, free from malice, and <lb/>
above carping personalities; without <reg orig="jeal-|ousy">jealousy</reg> <lb/>
and bitterness and incapable of hate, <lb/>
she commands our admiration as woman <lb/>
no less than as reformer. During the <lb/>
last years of her life, she used to sit alone, <lb/>
knitting, since her faithful and devoted <lb/>
husband had passed away twelve years <lb/>
before the summons came to her.</p>
<p>Those frail hands were never idle, that <lb/>
eager, active intellect never still. She <lb/>
<pb n="102" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0165"/>
had a wonderful memory and used to <lb/>
repeat to herself, in the twilight hours of <lb/>
her life, long passages from her favourite <lb/>
poems. These lines from her beloved <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Light of Asia</hi> may well be taken, as has <lb/>
been said, for the keynote of her whole <lb/>
life: <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>This will I do because the woful cry</l>
<l>Of life and all flesh living cometh up</l>
<l>Into my ears, and all my soul is full</l>
<l>Of pity for the sickness of this world;</l>
<l>Which I will heal, if healing may be found</l>
<l>By uttermost renouncing and strong strife.</l>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Thus</hi> wrote Longfellow of Florence <lb/>
Nightingale in his <hi rend="italic">Santa Filomena</hi>, <lb/>
and the image of "the lady with the <lb/>
lamp" has proved to be more than a pretty <lb/>
figure of speech. The graduates of one <lb/>
well-known training school for nurses have <lb/>
engraved on their class pins the Latin <lb/>
words meaning "I bring hope." In like <lb/>
manner, Florence Nightingale might have <lb/>
<pb n="106" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0169"/>
worn on her breast the words, "I bring <lb/>
light."</p>
<p>Before her time, English nurses were of <lb/>
the "Sairey Gamp" type&mdash;ignorant, <reg orig="super-|stitious">superstitious</reg>, <lb/>
grasping, often cruel, and usually <lb/>
drunk. Every "Sairey" had with her <lb/>
a bottle of rum or gin, helping herself <lb/>
to the delusive comfort of it when "so <lb/>
dispoged."</p>
<p>Florence Nightingale's great work began <lb/>
with her great heart. Even as a child, <lb/>
she could not bear to see people or animals <lb/>
suffer, and a pretty story is told of her <lb/>
saving "Cap," a faithful old sheep dog <lb/>
whose leg was broken. As he was useless <lb/>
he was about to be hung, when Florence <lb/>
interceded with the herder, went for <lb/>
the vicar, who said the leg was not <lb/>
broken, only bruised, and began treatment <lb/>
immediately.</p>
<p>She took off her red flannel petticoat <lb/>
and tore it into strips, bandaged the leg <lb/>

<pb entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0171"/>
<pb n="107" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0172"/>
tightly, and fomented it steadily with <lb/>
hot water until poor Cap's sufferings were <lb/>
measurably relieved. She attended him <lb/>
faithfully until he was well and found her <lb/>
reward in the old dog's lifelong gratitude. <lb/>
Even when he was on duty, guarding the <lb/>
sheep, and could not leave his post, he <lb/>
never failed to recognise her by an eager <lb/>
whine and joyous waggings of his tail.</p>
<p>When she grew to womanhood, she <lb/>
perceived that her life-work and her life's <lb/>
happiness lay in this unselfish ministry to <lb/>
pain. But, unlike the "Sairey Gamps," <lb/>
she perceived that training and study were <lb/>
necessary, and she spent ten long years <lb/>
in travel and study before she was willing <lb/>
to take charge of even a small hospital.</p>
<p>She studied in an institution at <reg orig="Kaisers-|werth">Kaiserswerth</reg> <lb/>
on the Rhine, and went from there to <lb/>
other institutions in Germany, Italy, and <lb/>
France. Whenever she heard of an up-<reg orig="to-|date">to-date</reg> <lb/>
method in operation, she went to the <lb/>
<pb n="108" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0173"/>
place to investigate it, analysing, sifting, <lb/>
comparing, and improving, until she felt <lb/>
herself competent not only to nurse but <lb/>
to teach nursing.</p>
<p>"I would say to all young ladies," she <lb/>
wrote, "who are called to any particular <lb/>
vocation, qualify yourselves for it, as a <lb/>
man does for his work. Don't think you <lb/>
can undertake it otherwise. No one should <lb/>
attempt to teach the Greek language until <lb/>
he is master of the language, and this he <lb/>
can only become by hard study. If you <lb/>
are called to man's work, do not exact a <lb/>
woman's privileges&mdash;the privilege of <reg orig="in-|accuracy">inaccuracy</reg>, <lb/>
of weakness, of muddleheads. <lb/>
Submit yourself to the rules of business <lb/>
as men do, by which alone you can make <lb/>
God's business succeed, for He has never <lb/>
said that He will give His success and His <lb/>
blessing to inefficiency, to sketchy and <lb/>
unfinished work."</p>
<p>These trenchant words might well be <lb/>
<pb n="109" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0174"/>
taken to heart by every young woman in <lb/>
the land, for a vast amount of industrial <lb/>
disturbance has already resulted from <lb/>
women trying to do men's work, and keep, <lb/>
at the same time, "the privilege of <reg orig="in-|accuracy">inaccuracy</reg>, <lb/>
of weakness, of muddleheads."</p>
<p>"Muddlehead" was a favourite word of <lb/>
Miss Nightingale's, and expressed, tersely <lb/>
enough, her view of many a painful <reg orig="situa-|tion">situation</reg>. <lb/>
When ships came from England <lb/>
to the Crimea, laden with shoes for the <lb/>
soldiers, and all the shoes proved to be for <lb/>
the left foot, Miss Nightingale reported <lb/>
to the English officer in charge: "<reg orig="Muddle-|heads">Muddleheads</reg> <lb/>
do not all belong to one sex."</p>
<p>When she first returned from her <reg orig="train-|ing">training</reg> <lb/>
abroad, she took charge of a nursing <lb/>
home and hospital for governesses, which <lb/>
had fallen into disrepute through "Sairey <lb/>
Gamp" methods, and into dire disorder <lb/>
through mismanagement. In little more <lb/>
than a year, she had the entire place <reg orig="re-|organised">reorganised</reg>, <lb/>
<pb n="110" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0175"/>
a new system in full and effective <lb/>
operation, strict discipline in force, and <lb/>
the most modern of sanitary conditions <lb/>
throughout.</p>
<p>Everything was orderly, business-like, <lb/>
and as it should be. One felt, on <reg orig="enter-|ing">entering</reg> <lb/>
the door, that the place had a head. <lb/>
Those who served under her in this hospital <lb/>
said of her that she had "a voice of velvet <lb/>
and a will of steel."</p>
<p>Soon after the Crimean War broke out, <lb/>
in 1854, reports reached England of the <lb/>
terrible state of affairs at the front. <lb/>
Justin Huntly M'Carthy portrays the <lb/>
situation vividly in his <hi rend="italic">History of Our <lb/>
Times:</hi></p>
<p>"In some instances medical stores were <lb/>
left to decay at Varna or were found <lb/>
useless in the holds of vessels in Balaklava <lb/>
Bay, which were needed for the wounded <lb/>
at Scutari. The medical officers were <lb/>
able and zealous men, the stores were <lb/>
<pb n="111" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0176"/>
provided and paid for as far as the <reg orig="Govern-|ment">Government</reg> <lb/>
was concerned, but the stores were <lb/>
not brought to the medical men. These <lb/>
had their hands all idle, their eyes and souls <lb/>
tortured by the sight of sufferings which <lb/>
they were unable to relieve for want of the <lb/>
commonest appliances of the hospital."</p>
<p>Out of a total loss of about twenty-one <lb/>
thousand, less than three thousand were <lb/>
actually slain in battle&mdash;the rest died in the <lb/>
hospitals. During the first seven months <lb/>
of the siege, soldiers died at a rate which <lb/>
would have wiped out the entire force in <lb/>
less than eighteen months. When these <lb/>
conditions became known in England, <lb/>
the Minister of War asked Miss <reg orig="Nightin-|gale">Nightingale</reg> <lb/>
to go to the front. She gladly <reg orig="con-|sented">consented</reg>, <lb/>
and, armed with full authority <lb/>
and with forty-two competent nurses <lb/>
under her direction, arrived at <reg orig="Constanti-|nople">Constantinople</reg> <lb/>
the day before the Battle of <reg orig="Inker-|man">Inkerman</reg>.</p>
<pb n="112" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0177"/>
<p>After the battle, more than two <reg orig="thou-|sand">thousand</reg> <lb/>
wounded men were brought into the <lb/>
wards. Several times Miss Nightingale <lb/>
remained on duty for twenty hours at a <lb/>
stretch. She gave her attention not only <lb/>
to the wounded but to the establishment <lb/>
of sanitary conditions in the camp. <reg orig="With-|in">Within</reg> <lb/>
a few months after her arrival, ten <lb/>
thousand sick soldiers were under her <lb/>
care, and the row of beds in one <reg orig="hos-|pital">hospital</reg> <lb/>
alone measured over two miles in <lb/>
length.</p>
<p>Her slight figure and her pale face <reg orig="in-|spired">inspired</reg> <lb/>
chivalrous devotion in the ranks. <lb/>
Men who had refused doggedly to submit <lb/>
to painful operations, yielded readily after <lb/>
a few words from her. "Before she came," <lb/>
one soldier said, "everybody was cursing <lb/>
and swearing, but now the place is as <lb/>
holy as a church."</p>
<p>Night after night, when she was supposed <lb/>
to be asleep after a day of almost incredible <lb/>
<pb n="113" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0178"/>
work, the Lady with the Lamp, softly <lb/>
shod, stepped into the long, dim aisle <lb/>
between two rows of cots. She passed <lb/>
slowly, listening for the regular breathing <lb/>
of soldiers fallen asleep, or for the eloquent <lb/>
stillness encompassing one whose pain <lb/>
had forever ceased. Now and then she <lb/>
stopped, to see that all was will with some <lb/>
poor lad whose sufferings had been eased <lb/>
by the surgeon's knife, to straighten a <lb/>
coverlid, smooth a pillow, or put a draught <lb/>
of cold water to parched lips.</p>
<p>At some, who were awake, she nodded <lb/>
and smiled; at others, who wished to <lb/>
talk, she shook her head and, with her <lb/>
finger on her lips, whispered, "Hush!" <lb/>
Sometimes she laid a cool, soft hand upon <lb/>
a fevered face, and once, for the sake of <lb/>
the far-away mother to whom he <reg orig="unceasing-|ingly">unceasingingly</reg> <lb/>
called, she stooped to kiss a <reg orig="curly-|headed">curly-headed</reg> <lb/>
boy, who quieted down like a child <lb/>
at the touch.</p>
<pb n="114" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0179"/>
<p>Down the long, narrow aisle of pain she <lb/>
went, noiselessly yet tenderly, shading <lb/>
her lamp with her slender hand. <reg orig="Some-|times">Sometimes</reg> <lb/>
a soldier would kiss her shadow as <lb/>
it darkened for an instant across his <lb/>
pillow, and lie down again, content, for <lb/>
in the wake of the dark-robed Lady with <lb/>
the Lamp came sleep.</p>
<p>In less than a year she was ill with <lb/>
hospital fever, but as soon as she <reg orig="re-|covered">recovered</reg> <lb/>
she went back to her post <lb/>
and never left it until the war was at an <lb/>
end.</p>
<p>When she returned to England, she <lb/>
received a welcome that would have <lb/>
warmed the heart of a Queen. Two <lb/>
hundred and fifty thousand dollars, raised <lb/>
by popular subscription, represented the <lb/>
national appreciation of her services. Miss <lb/>
Nightingale took the money gladly&mdash;and <lb/>
devoted it to the endowment of <reg orig="training-|schools">training-schools</reg> <lb/>
for nurses. She kept only the <lb/>
<pb n="115" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0180"/>
jewelled token which the Queen personally <lb/>
gave to her.</p>
<p>The direct result of her work was an <lb/>
international agreement at the Geneva <lb/>
Convention, ten years later, neutralising <lb/>
all ambulances and military hospitals, and <lb/>
putting hospital inmates and staff on the <lb/>
footing of non-combatants. She was the <lb/>
first of the noble army of Red Cross women <lb/>
who have since followed in the wake of <reg orig="mus-|ketry">musketry</reg> <lb/>
and sabre, to comfort, to heal, and <lb/>
to save.</p>
<p>After the war, she interested herself <lb/>
largely in sanitary conditions as applied <lb/>
to the army in India, and became a valued <lb/>
adviser of the Government, keeping up <lb/>
her private work as constantly as her <lb/>
shattered health would permit.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Side</hi> by side with the name of Florence <lb/>
Nightingale stands that of Dorothy <lb/>
Wyndlow Pattison, familiarly and <reg orig="affec-|tionately">affectionately</reg> <lb/>
known as "Sister Dora." She <lb/>
was born in Yorkshire, England, in 1832, <lb/>
and her childhood was much like that of <lb/>
other children not destined for great work <lb/>
and lasting fame.</p>
<p>It is recorded that, in her early youth, <lb/>
she and her sister were given velvet <lb/>
bonnets which they chose to consider ugly. <lb/>
One day when the two children were left <lb/>
alone in the house, Dorothy whispered, <lb/>
"Come, now is our chance!" It was <lb/>
raining hard, and the inclement weather <lb/>
gave the ingenious Dorothy a bright idea. <lb/>
They put on the hated bonnets, opened <lb/>
<pb n="120" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0185"/>
the window, and leaned out into the <lb/>
pouring rain. When the velvet was <lb/>
thoroughly saturated, they returned them <lb/>
to the bandboxes. On the following <reg orig="Sun-|day">Sunday</reg>, <lb/>
when invited to get ready for church, <lb/>
Dorothy explained airily that they could <lb/>
not go until they had new bonnets, as the <lb/>
others were quite unpresentable. The <lb/>
excuse was not accepted, nor did the <lb/>
new bonnets materialise, but Dorothy <lb/>
and her sister were forced, all winter <lb/>
long, to wear the despised and injured <lb/>
headgear, in the exact condition in which <lb/>
it was found!</p>
<p>When she was fourteen, Dorothy had a <lb/>
long and dangerous illness from which she <lb/>
did not recover for months. At that <lb/>
time, England was swept by a great popular <lb/>
enthusiasm inspired by Miss Nightingale's <lb/>
wonderful work in the Crimea, and, though <lb/>
far too young, and not strong enough to <lb/>
take even a short journey, Dorothy begged <lb/>

<head>Sister Dora</head>
<p>From the statue erected to her memory</p>
</figure>
<pb entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0187"/>
<pb n="121" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0188"/>
unceasingly to be allowed to join Miss <lb/>
Nightingale and help her in her work.</p>
<p>For years after her recovery she <reg orig="per-|sisted">persisted</reg> <lb/>
in her desire to leave home and <lb/>
become a trained nurse. Her father <reg orig="con-|tinually">continually</reg> <lb/>
opposed it, but finally gave in, <lb/>
when she was twenty-five. He refused <lb/>
to make her any allowance beyond what <lb/>
he had always given her for clothing and <lb/>
pin money, so she was obliged to find a way <lb/>
in which to earn the balance.</p>
<p>For three years she lived alone in a <lb/>
small cottage, teaching school and doing <lb/>
all her own housework. The villagers <lb/>
were much astonished to discover that a <lb/>
woman might be a "real lady" and yet soil <lb/>
her hands continually with tasks which <lb/>
seemed degrading.</p>
<p>Finding it impossible to secure <reg orig="other-|wise">otherwise</reg> <lb/>
the longed-for training, she joined <lb/>
a High Church sisterhood at Coatham, <lb/>
called the Sisterhood of the Good <reg orig="Samari-|tans">Samaritans</reg>, <lb/>
<pb n="122" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0189"/>
and was henceforth called "Sister <lb/>
Dora."</p>
<p>The training and discipline of the <reg orig="Sister-|hood">Sisterhood</reg> <lb/>
were rigid in the extreme. The idea <lb/>
was to humble pride, and to inculcate <reg orig="sub-|missiveness">submissiveness</reg> <lb/>
and reverence for authority. <lb/>
Sister Dora was one day ordered to make <lb/>
all the beds in the establishment, and, <reg orig="hav-|ing">having</reg> <lb/>
done so, was invited to pull them all <lb/>
to pieces and do it over. She scrubbed <lb/>
floors, and people came in purposely, with <lb/>
mud and ashes, and made the floors dirty <lb/>
again. Then she was ordered to scrub <lb/>
once more. She also cooked, cleaned <lb/>
grates and stoves, built fires, carried out <lb/>
ashes, and washed dishes&mdash;all with dignity <lb/>
and cheerfulness.</p>
<p>She was sent by the Sisterhood, when <lb/>
her novitiate was over, to a small hospital <lb/>
in Walsall. Toward the end of the year, <lb/>
she received orders to leave the <reg orig="hos-|pital">hospital</reg> <lb/>
and take a private case in the <lb/>
<pb n="123" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0190"/>
southern part of England. The people <lb/>
of Walsall objected to her leaving and <lb/>
framed a petition to the Sisterhood. At <lb/>
this time, she received word of her father's <lb/>
dangerous illness, and telegraphed to the <lb/>
Mother Superior, asking permission to go <lb/>
to him. This was immediately and sternly <lb/>
refused and she was ordered at once to <lb/>
Devonshire. With aching heart, she went. <lb/>
On reaching her patient's home, she learned <lb/>
that her father was dead. Then the <reg orig="Sister-|hood">Sisterhood</reg>, <lb/>
too late, relaxed its discipline, and <lb/>
wrote to her: "You may attend your <lb/>
father's funeral, if you please." Bitterly, <lb/>
she answered thus: "When my father was <lb/>
alive, you did not permit me to go to him. <lb/>
Now that he is dead, I no longer care to go."</p>
<p>Yet for ten years she continued to be a <lb/>
devoted member of the Sisterhood. She <lb/>
returned to Walsall, and among the poor, <lb/>
the ignorant, and the afflicted, carried the <lb/>
gospel of cleanliness and hope.</p>
<pb n="124" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0191"/>
<p>Once, when the impression got abroad <lb/>
that the "Good Samaritans" were papists, <lb/>
the hospital was stoned by a mob from the <lb/>
coal mines. Sister Dora was badly cut <lb/>
on the forehead and carried the scar to <lb/>
her dying day. Before her wound had <lb/>
healed, however, the lad who threw the <lb/>
stone was carried into the hospital, badly <lb/>
hurt. Sister Dora recognised him, and <lb/>
gave him special care. One day, during <lb/>
his convalescence, he confessed, sobbing, <lb/>
"Sister, I threw that stone at you."</p>
<p>"Yes," she answered, quietly, "I know. <lb/>
I knew it as soon as you were brought in <lb/>
here."</p>
<p>"You knew," cried the boy, in wonder <lb/>
and admiration, "and yet you have been <lb/>
taking care of me like this!"</p>
<p>She was once given charge of an old <lb/>
lady who was violently insane, and whom <lb/>
everyone else feared to approach. Sister <lb/>
Dora's gentleness, patience, and tact won <lb/>
<pb n="125" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0192"/>
the poor creature's affections, and <reg orig="eventu-|ally">eventually</reg>, <lb/>
through love, the old lady became <lb/>
cured. Long afterward, in speaking of <lb/>
it, Sister Dora said, "I had an uncommonly <lb/>
pleasant time with that mad old lady!"</p>
<p>Loving all deeply and unselfishly, <reg orig="Sis-|ter">Sister</reg> <lb/>
Dora inspired her patients with that <lb/>
answering love through which miracles <lb/>
are wrought. Once, when holding a badly <lb/>
burned child in her arms, Sister Dora <lb/>
whispered, "Hush, don't cry; Sister's <lb/>
got you!" "Oh," sobbed the child, <lb/>
"when you get to heaven, Sister Dora, <lb/>
I'll be waiting at the gate for you with a <lb/>
bouquet of flowers!"</p>
<p>By skilled nursing, she saved a badly <lb/>
injured arm which the surgeons said would <lb/>
have to be amputated. The man ever <lb/>
afterward alluded to it gratefully as "Sister <lb/>
Dora's arm." When she was ill and he <lb/>
had fully recovered, he would walk eleven <lb/>
miles to the hospital every Sunday <reg orig="morn-|ing">morning</reg>, <lb/>
<pb n="126" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0193"/>
to ask for her. He never failed to <lb/>
leave this characteristic message: "Tell <lb/>
her it's her arm that rang the bell."</p>
<p>Twice she served through smallpox <reg orig="epi-|demics">epidemics</reg>. <lb/>
At the second one an <reg orig="ambu-|lance">ambulance</reg> <lb/>
was provided in Walsall to take the <lb/>
stricken ones to the hospital. Sister Dora <lb/>
would drive to a house, enter unannounced, <lb/>
and say she had come to take the patient <lb/>
to the hospital. Resistance was useless, <lb/>
for Sister Dora was strong, and more than <lb/>
once she simply took an unwilling patient <lb/>
in her arms, either man or woman, <reg orig="depos-|ited">deposited</reg> <lb/>
her ailing burden in the ambulance, <lb/>
and drove on. It is said that the whole <lb/>
town was cheered and kept from panic <lb/>
by the frequent passing of the ambulance <lb/>
and Sister Dora "with her jolly face smiling <lb/>
out of the window."</p>
<p>For six months she was practically <lb/>
alone in a hospital full of smallpox patients. <lb/>
She never had her bonnet on and went no <lb/>
<pb n="127" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0194"/>
farther than the gate, yet, from here, she <lb/>
wrote to a friend: "I am still a prisoner, <lb/>
surrounded by my lepers. I do feel so <lb/>
thankful that I came. I thank God daily <lb/>
for my life here."</p>
<p>Eventually, she left the Sisterhood, and <lb/>
continued her work unhampered by <reg orig="re-|strictions">restrictions</reg>. <lb/>
"I am a woman," she <reg orig="ex-|plained">explained</reg>, <lb/>
"and not a piece of furniture." <lb/>
She renounced marriage with the man she <lb/>
loved that she might continue in her <reg orig="pro-|fession">profession</reg>. <lb/>
"The world needs me more than <lb/>
he does," she said, "and I can never give <lb/>
up my work."</p>
<p>At forty-four, Sister Dora was stricken <lb/>
with an incurable disease. The surgeon <lb/>
whom she consulted told her that an <reg orig="opera-|tion">operation</reg> <lb/>
might prolong her life, but could not <lb/>
save it. She insisted that the fact be kept <lb/>
secret&mdash;and went on with her work.</p>
<p>Knowing that her days were numbered, <lb/>
she was eager to crowd in as much of life <lb/>
<pb n="128" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0195"/>
as possible. She went to London to study <lb/>
a new antisepticising process; she went to <lb/>
the Paris Exposition to see new surgical <lb/>
appliances. Incredible as it may seem, <lb/>
she became more sunny and cheerful than <lb/>
ever. She was more self-sacrificing in <lb/>
behalf of her patients, more sternly <reg orig="self-|denying">self-denying</reg>, <lb/>
more Christ-like, and even <reg orig="hap-|pier">happier</reg> <lb/>
than she had ever been before.</p>
<p>When she returned to Walsall, a new <lb/>
hospital bearing her name was opened <lb/>
by the Mayor, but she was too ill to be <lb/>
present. The townspeople refused to <reg orig="be-|lieve">believe</reg> <lb/>
that their "dear lady" was ill, and <lb/>
when at last they were convinced that <lb/>
she could not recover, everyone was <reg orig="grief-|stricken">grief-stricken</reg>.</p>
<p>In every church, twice on Sundays and <lb/>
at the Wednesday night prayer-meeting, <lb/>
public prayers were offered for Sister Dora's <lb/>
restoration to health. In October, 1878, <lb/>
she wrote to a friend: "The decree has <lb/>
<pb n="129" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0196"/>
gone forth, 'Sister, put thy house in order, <lb/>
for thou shalt die, and not live.' There <lb/>
is only Mount Calvary to climb, by the <lb/>
ladder of sickness. I have not had two <lb/>
hours' sleep for four days and nights, but <lb/>
in the midst of the fiery furnace there was a <lb/>
form like unto the Son of God."</p>
<p>Eleven weeks of anguish followed, which <lb/>
she bore heroically, until the end came, on <lb/>
Christmas Eve. "I see Him there," she <lb/>
said; "the gates are opened wide." And <lb/>
through the open gates she went, free at <lb/>
last of all disease and pain, perhaps to <lb/>
find the poor little burned child of so many <lb/>
years ago, who had promised to wait at <lb/>
the gate for her "with a bouquet of <lb/>
flowers."</p>
<p>It was a sad Christmas Day for Walsall, <lb/>
and no celebrations were held. In some <lb/>
cases, even the presents intended for the <lb/>
children were put away, sadly, by weeping <lb/>
men and women. The whole city, <reg orig="wor-|shipping">worshipping</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="130" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0197"/>
her while living, paid honour to <lb/>
her when she was dead.</p>
<p>Eight years afterward, in the midst of the <lb/>
smoke and dirt of the central part of <reg orig="Wal-|sall">Walsall</reg>, <lb/>
was erected a noble statue, of purest <lb/>
marble&mdash;a likeness of Sister Dora when she <lb/>
was young and beautiful, strong, and <lb/>
happy in her chosen work. In her last <lb/>
days she said once that she wished she <lb/>
had married, but otherwise she voiced no <lb/>
regret, even for her intense bodily pain. <lb/>
"Say of me," she said, "only this&mdash;she <lb/>
hath done what she could!"</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> house was quiet and the slanting <lb/>
afternoon sunbeams lay upon the <lb/>
floor. A little maid of three sat at the <lb/>
window, playing with a ragged and <reg orig="dis-|reputable">disreputable</reg> <lb/>
doll. Into the silent street <lb/>
came the sound of music and the tread <lb/>
of marching feet; the gleam of scarlet <lb/>
and gold and the cry of silver bugles. The <lb/>
little maid's doll fell to the floor and lay <lb/>
there, forgotten, till the music died away. <lb/>
Then the tiny feet pattered over to the <lb/>
piano and a dimpled forefinger strummed <lb/>
out the fanfare of the bugles.</p>
<p>The old grandmother came into the <lb/>
room, expecting to find the elder sister, but <lb/>
no one was there save the little maid of <lb/>
three, who crouched, half-frightened, under <lb/>
<pb n="134" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0201"/>
the piano. "Child," cried the <reg orig="grand-|mother">grandmother</reg> <lb/>
in astonishment, "was that you?"</p>
<p>Truthful Jenny could only nod, with <lb/>
her head hanging in shame. Much to <lb/>
her surprise, she was not punished for <lb/>
her daring. The grandmother merely <reg orig="ob-|served">observed</reg> <lb/>
to Mrs. Lind, when she came home <lb/>
again, "That child will bring you help."</p>
<p>The way had been hard for Jenny's <lb/>
mother, who had been obliged to separate <lb/>
herself from a worthless husband, but not <lb/>
until her school failed did she permit the <lb/>
child to be taken from her. The <reg orig="grand-|mother">grandmother</reg> <lb/>
had rooms in the Widows' Home <lb/>
in Stockholm, and when Mrs. Lind at last <lb/>
secured a position as governess in a private <lb/>
family, Jenny went to the Widows' Home <lb/>
to live with her grandmother.</p>
<p>Like many other children, she liked the <lb/>
kitchen better than the rest of the house, <lb/>
and used to sit in the steward's window, <lb/>
playing with her cat, and singing, as the <lb/>
<pb n="135" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0202"/>
birds sing, from sheer light-heartedness <lb/>
and joy. She knew no "tunes," but she <lb/>
made them herself as she went along, just <lb/>
as the thrushes make theirs. Unmindful <lb/>
of the crowd in the busy street, Jenny sat <lb/>
in her high window with her cat and sang <lb/>
all day.</p>
<p>One fateful afternoon, the maid of <lb/>
Mademoiselle Lundberg, a singer at the <lb/>
Royal Opera House, passed the window&mdash; <lb/>
and stopped to listen. She took careful <lb/>
note of the street and number, then <reg orig="has-|tened">hastened</reg> <lb/>
back to tell her mistress of the <lb/>
wonderful voice she had heard. Her <reg orig="en-|thusiasm">enthusiasm</reg> <lb/>
was contagious and <reg orig="Mademoi-|selle">Mademoiselle</reg> <lb/>
Lundberg sought out the child, found <lb/>
her mother, and arranged to have Jenny <lb/>
come to sing for her.</p>
<p>Jenny sang joyously, never before having <lb/>
had an audience, and Mademoiselle <reg orig="Lund-|berg">Lundberg</reg> <lb/>
was moved to tears. She wrote a <lb/>
letter of introduction to Herr Croelius, the <lb/>
<pb n="136" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0203"/>
Court secretary and singing master at the <lb/>
Royal Theatre, and here Jenny sang again.</p>
<p>"I must take her at once," said Herr <lb/>
Croelius, "to Count Puke, the head of <lb/>
the Royal Theatre, and tell him what a <lb/>
treasure I have found."</p>
<p>Jenny skipped along, unconsciously, <lb/>
into the Great Presence, feared alike by <lb/>
prima-donnas and high-salaried tenors. <lb/>
Count Puke was not impressed, and did <lb/>
not desire to hear more music.</p>
<p>"How old is she?" asked the Count.</p>
<p>"Just nine," replied Jenny's mother.</p>
<p>"Nine!" repeated the Count. "This <lb/>
is not a <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italic">cr&egrave;che</hi></foreign>, Madam; it is the King's <lb/>
Theatre!"</p>
<p>Hereupon Herr Croelius observed that <lb/>
if the Count would not hear her sing, he <lb/>
himself would teach her gratuitously. <lb/>
Presently the Count said, wearily, that he <lb/>
supposed he might as well hear her sing <lb/>
and be done with it. So Jenny sang once <lb/>
<pb n="137" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0204"/>
more, and the Count gladly accepted her <lb/>
as his pupil. He forgot that she was but <lb/>
nine and small for her age; he forgot that <lb/>
he had made unkind remarks about her <lb/>
hands and feet and her homely little face; <lb/>
he forgot everything but the fact that into <lb/>
his hands was entrusted the making of a <lb/>
great artist.</p>
<p>Thus began a career in many ways the <lb/>
most wonderful of its century. Jenny <lb/>
Lind's fame swept triumphantly over <lb/>
Europe and America; for nearly half a <lb/>
century, she was a commanding figure <lb/>
behind the footlights, and for many years <lb/>
she was the acknowledged queen of song.</p>
<p>"As to the greater part of what I can <lb/>
do in my art," she wrote, when she was <lb/>
forty-five, "I have myself acquired it by <lb/>
incredible work and in spite of astonishing <lb/>
difficulties&hellip; To such a degree had God <lb/>
written within me what I had to study. <lb/>
My ideal was&mdash;and is&mdash;so high that no <lb/>
<pb n="138" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0205"/>
mortal was to be found who in the least <lb/>
degree could satisfy my demands; <reg orig="there-|fore">therefore</reg> <lb/>
I sing after no one's method&mdash;only <lb/>
after that of the birds, so far as I am able."</p>
<p>The early years were full of hard work, <lb/>
for there are no seats along the path which <lb/>
leads to success. She was frightened <lb/>
when she was asked to sing in <reg orig="Copen-|hagen">Copenhagen</reg>, <lb/>
fearing she would not be kindly <lb/>
received. Yet the stolid Danes gave her <lb/>
an ovation. "On the stage," wrote Hans <lb/>
Andersen, the beloved author of fairy <lb/>
tales, "she was the great artist who rose <lb/>
above all those around her; at home, in <lb/>
her own chamber, a sensitive young girl <lb/>
with all the humility and piety of a child. <lb/>
Her appearance in Copenhagen made an <lb/>
epoch in the history of our opera; it showed <lb/>
me art in its sanctity; I had beheld one <lb/>
of its vestals."</p>
<p>The Danish students gave her a serenade, <lb/>
and torches blazed around the villa in which <lb/>
<pb n="139" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0206"/>
she was stopping. She expressed her <lb/>
thanks by singing a little Swedish song, <lb/>
without accompaniment, from the <reg orig="bal-|cony&mdash;then">balcony&mdash;then</reg> <lb/>
she crept into a dark corner <lb/>
and wept for joy. In Copenhagen, too, <lb/>
she gave a concert, at double prices, for <lb/>
the benefit of unfortunate children. When <lb/>
she was told of the vast sum that had been <lb/>
realised at the box-office, she smiled, but <lb/>
the tears filled her eyes. "It is, however, <lb/>
beautiful," she said, simply, "that I can <lb/>
sing so."</p>
<p>Her tour through Scandinavia and <reg orig="Ger-|many">Germany</reg> <lb/>
was like that of a royal personage. <lb/>
Gifts were lavished upon her, and flowers <lb/>
were strewn in her path. On her last <lb/>
night in Vienna, before going to England, <lb/>
the audience joined the multitude which <lb/>
escorted her carriage home. Thirty times, <lb/>
it is said, they called her to the window, <lb/>
crying out: "Jenny Lind! Jenny Lind! <lb/>
Say you will come back again!" She <lb/>
<pb n="140" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0207"/>
stood at the window, sobbing like a child, <lb/>
and throwing flowers into the crowd, <lb/>
until not a blossom was left in her rooms.</p>
<p>Twenty thousand people were on the <lb/>
pier to say good-bye, when Jenny Lind <lb/>
sailed for England. "She embarked amid <lb/>
cheers, music, and tears, and, as she sailed <lb/>
out of the harbour, the rigging of the <lb/>
vessels was decorated with flags, and <lb/>
manned, while the artillery from the war <lb/>
vessels thundered salutes."</p>
<p>When she reached London, Lablache, the <lb/>
basso, who was one of the first to hear her <lb/>
sing, remarked that "every note was like <lb/>
a perfect pearl." Forthwith she borrowed <lb/>
his hat, and mischievously sang into it a <lb/>
French romanza. At the end of the song, <lb/>
she returned it to him, saying that she <lb/>
took pleasure in presenting him a hatful <lb/>
of pearls. Not to be outdone, Lablache <lb/>
avowed himself more pleased than he <lb/>
could have been with a hatful of diamonds.</p>
<pb n="141" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0208"/>
<p>Her income took on splendid proportions, <lb/>
and she gave liberally to charity. Worthy <lb/>
or unworthy, no one went empty-handed <lb/>
from Jenny Lind. She gave concerts for <lb/>
charities that especially appealed to her, <lb/>
and sang for those who longed to hear her <lb/>
and could not go to the concerts. She <lb/>
spent an afternoon in the cottage of a <lb/>
poor mechanic, who was bedridden, giving <lb/>
him gladly of that wonderful gift which <lb/>
had held kings and queens entranced. <lb/>
She went to a blind old lady of eighty, <lb/>
and sang for two hours, thus proving <reg orig="her-|self">herself</reg>, <lb/>
indeed, "a prince among givers."</p>
<p>Critics say that while her voice was a <lb/>
clear soprano, wide in range and well <lb/>
schooled, there were other voices fully as <lb/>
good. While she lost herself wholly in <lb/>
the part she was playing, there were <reg orig="ac-|tresses">actresses</reg> <lb/>
greater than she. It is said that she <lb/>
was not prepossessing in appearance&mdash;that <lb/>
she was positively ugly, until she began to <lb/>
<pb n="142" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0209"/>
sing. Then the beautiful soul illumined <lb/>
her face, put magic into her voice, and the <lb/>
great charm of her personality won her <lb/>
audience instantly.</p>
<p>Once, for a brief period, she lost her <lb/>
voice, and, as she long afterward told <lb/>
Mendelssohn, the agony of that first <lb/>
moment of realisation exceeded all she <lb/>
had suffered in her whole life. For, <lb/>
at that time, her voice was all she had. <lb/>
"I am convinced," wrote one of her friends <lb/>
in his diary, "that she would gladly <reg orig="ex-|change">exchange</reg> <lb/>
all her triumphs for simple, homely <lb/>
happiness. She sees that in Mendelssohn's <lb/>
house, where his wife and children make <lb/>
his happiness complete."</p>
<p>At Bath, she saw an old woman walking <lb/>
back and forth in front of the almshouse. <lb/>
After talking with her a few moments, <lb/>
she discovered that the one great desire <lb/>
of the poor old pauper's life was to hear <lb/>
Jenny Lind sing. "Sit down," said the <lb/>
<pb n="143" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0210"/>
great singer, gently. The old lady heard, <lb/>
and wept at the beauty of the music. <lb/>
"Now you have heard her," said the <reg orig="stran-|ger">stranger</reg>, <lb/>
abruptly&mdash;and went upon her <reg orig="flower-|strewn">flower-strewn</reg> <lb/>
way.</p>
<p>"It is indeed a great joy, and a gift <lb/>
from God," she wrote to her guardian in <lb/>
Sweden, "to be allowed to earn so much <lb/>
money and afterwards to help one's <lb/>
fellow-men with it. This is the highest joy <lb/>
I wish for in this life; everything else has <lb/>
disappeared from the many-coloured course <lb/>
of my path on earth. Few know, though, <lb/>
what a beautiful and quiet inner life I am <lb/>
living. Few suspect how unutterably little <lb/>
the world and its splendour have been <lb/>
able to turn my mind giddy."</p>
<p>The unparalleled splendour of her career, <lb/>
in spite of the real and lasting happiness, <lb/>
was powerless to satisfy the deepest need <lb/>
of her soul. At thirty-two, after receiving <lb/>
the homage of two continents, she married <lb/>
<pb n="144" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0211"/>
Otto Goldschmidt and, like the people in <lb/>
the fairy tales, "lived happily ever after." <lb/>
She wrote to a friend that she had found <lb/>
"all that her heart ever wanted and loved."</p>
<p>He was nearly ten years younger than <lb/>
she, but the little blind god takes no note <lb/>
of the years when souls are truly mated. <lb/>
For a long time, she continued her work, at <lb/>
first steadily, then intermittently. <reg orig="Child-|ren">Children</reg> <lb/>
came to her, and in order to take the <lb/>
best care of them and superintend their <lb/>
education, she left the stage forever. Her <lb/>
last concert, appropriately enough, was <lb/>
given for the Railway Servants' Benevolent <lb/>
Fund.</p>
<p>A friend once found her sitting on the <lb/>
beach, with an old Lutheran Bible in her <lb/>
lap, watching, with rapt face, the play of a <lb/>
glorious sunset upon the changing waters. <lb/>
"Why," asked the friend, softly, "did <lb/>
you leave the stage at the very zenith <lb/>
of your career?"</p>
<pb n="145" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0212"/>
<p>"When every day made me think less <lb/>
of this," replied Jenny Lind, referring to <lb/>
the Bible, "and nothing at all of that," <lb/>
pointing to the sunset, "what could I do?"</p>
<p>"There is no career," says her <reg orig="bio-|grapher">biographer</reg>, <lb/>
justly, "which can leave a deeper <lb/>
impression of the entire supremacy, over <lb/>
all the world can bring, of the spiritual <lb/>
motive. She is given everything, and yet <lb/>
all is as nothing, if it does not leave her free <lb/>
to sit alone by the sea-shore, and to look <lb/>
at the sunset, and at the old Lutheran <lb/>
Bible, with the pure eyes that can see God."</p>

<p>Thus Miss Alcott's father announced <lb/>
her birth to a beloved friend, little <reg orig="dream-|ing">dreaming</reg>, <lb/>
at the time, what a real blessing this <lb/>
birthday-child of his would eventually <lb/>
prove to be.</p>
<p>The little maiden thrived from the <lb/>

lovable qualities. The good fairy who <reg orig="pre-|sided">presided</reg> <lb/>
over her earthly destinies endowed <lb/>
her also with that finest gift of the gods&mdash; <lb/>
a sense of humour.</p>
<p>Before she was able to speak plainly, <lb/>
the infant Louisa pounded upon the <lb/>
breakfast table one morning to attract the <lb/>
attention of those present, and announced, <lb/>
emphatically, "I lub everybody in dis <lb/>

one can doubt, when reading of her <reg orig="beau-|tifully">beautifully</reg> <lb/>
unselfish life, that she was inspired <lb/>
wholly by love and devotion, not only to <lb/>
her family, but to the soldiers she nursed <lb/>
in the war, and, indeed, to the whole <lb/>
world.</p>
<p>Poverty, that handmaiden of the great, <lb/>
was a familiar guest in the Alcott home. <lb/>
Bronson Alcott, gifted though he was, <lb/>
was extremely unpractical. The family <lb/>
lived mostly upon plain boiled rice without <lb/>
sugar, and brown bread and mush without <lb/>
butter or molasses. Yet in spite of worldly <lb/>
misfortunes, happiness dwelt securely in <lb/>
their humble abode.</p>
<p>The children kept diaries and the family <lb/>
wrote letters to each other. Had Bronson <lb/>
Alcott been consciously training his <reg orig="daugh-|ter">daughter</reg> <lb/>
for authorship, he could not have <lb/>
done better than he did. Before she was <lb/>
thirteen, she was writing thus in her diary:</p>
<p>"I wrote in my imagination book to-day <lb/>
<pb n="152" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0221"/>
and enjoyed it very much. Life is <reg orig="pleas-|anter">pleasanter</reg> <lb/>
than it used to be and I don't care <lb/>
about dying any more. Had a splendid <lb/>
run and got a box of cones to burn. Sat <lb/>
and heard the pines sing a long time. <lb/>
Read Mrs. Bremer's <hi rend="italic">Home</hi> in the eve. I <lb/>
had a pleasant time with my mind, for <lb/>
it was happy."</p>
<p>At the same period, she speaks of reading <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Kenilworth</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Heart of Midlothian</hi>, <lb/>
and childish poems frequently appear, in <lb/>
unformed but legible handwriting, among <lb/>
the more serious entries.</p>
<p>The story in <hi rend="italic">Little Women</hi>, of giving the <lb/>
breakfast to a hungry family, is literally <lb/>
true. At another time, when a neighbour <lb/>
was descended upon by distinguished <lb/>
guests and the larder was in the condition of <lb/>
Old Mother Hubbard's famous cupboard, <lb/>
Louisa impulsively loaned the family's <lb/>
entire dinner, consulting no one until <lb/>
afterward. Probably no objection would <lb/>
<pb n="153" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0222"/>
have been made, however, since Bronson <lb/>
Alcott himself once divided his stock of <lb/>
wood with a neighbour who had none. <lb/>
"Never mind," said Mrs. Alcott, cheerily, <lb/>
"we can go to bed to keep warm when the <lb/>
wood gives out and amuse ourselves by <lb/>
telling stories."</p>
<p>The husband and father returned late <lb/>
one winter's night from a long lecturing <lb/>
trip, with exactly one dollar in his purse. <lb/>
He had been paid a little more, he explained <lb/>
forlornly, but as his overcoat had been <lb/>
stolen, he had been obliged to buy a shawl. <lb/>
After paying his travelling expenses, there <lb/>
was this one lone dollar left.</p>
<p>For a moment dismay seized the family, <lb/>
for the need was very great. Then Mrs. <lb/>
Alcott said: "I call that doing very well. <lb/>
Since you are safely home, dear, we don't <lb/>
ask anything more."</p>
<p>Louisa was a good teacher, sewed nicely, <lb/>
and began to find a market for her stories, <lb/>
<pb n="154" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0223"/>
but prices were low. One winter's <reg orig="earn-|ings">earnings</reg> <lb/>
she summed up as follows: "School, <lb/>
one quarter, $50.00; sewing, $50.00; stories, <lb/>
$20.00, if I am ever paid."</p>
<p>Once she went out to service for two <lb/>
months, and though she worked very <lb/>
hard and was treated like any common <lb/>
drudge, her father's philosophy and her <lb/>
own sense of humour stood her in good <lb/>
stead. She came from the ordeal with <lb/>
material for one of her best stories, <hi rend="italic">How I <lb/>
Went Out to Service.</hi></p>
<p>She served as nurse in the Civil War <lb/>
until she was taken ill and had to go home. <lb/>
Here she gathered material for her <hi rend="italic">Hospital <lb/>
Sketches</hi>, though life must have been hard <lb/>
enough without taking any excursions in <lb/>
the difficult path of literary composition.</p>
<p>"Up at six," she wrote, "dress by <reg orig="gas-|light">gaslight</reg>, <lb/>
run through my ward and throw <lb/>
up the windows, though the men grumble <lb/>
and shiver; but the air is bad enough to <lb/>
<pb n="155" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0224"/>
breed a pestilence, and as no notice is taken <lb/>
of our frequent appeals for better <reg orig="ventila-|tion">ventilation</reg>, <lb/>
I must do what I can. Poke up the <lb/>
fire, add blankets, joke, coax, and <reg orig="com-|mand">command</reg>, <lb/>
but continue to open doors and <lb/>
windows as if life depended upon it. &hellip; <lb/>
Till noon I trot, giving out rations, cutting <lb/>
up food for helpless boys, washing faces, <lb/>
teaching my attendants how beds are made <lb/>
or floors are swept, dressing wounds, <reg orig="dust-|ing">dusting</reg> <lb/>
tables, sewing bandages, keeping my <lb/>
tray tidy, rushing up and down after <lb/>
pillows, bed linen, sponges, books, and <lb/>
directions until it seems as if I would <lb/>
joyfully pay down all I possess for <reg orig="fif-|teen">fifteen</reg> <lb/>
minutes' rest. &hellip; The answering of <lb/>
letters from friends after someone has <lb/>
died is the saddest and hardest duty a <lb/>
nurse has to do."</p>
<p>After fifteen years of "hard grubbing," <lb/>
privation, and unfaltering courage, Louisa <lb/>
Alcott came into her own. Gradually <lb/>
<pb n="156" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0225"/>
the prices for her stories increased, and <lb/>
from having no publisher at all, her <reg orig="con-|dition">condition</reg> <lb/>
changed amazingly. Three or four <lb/>
publishers asked for her work, and with <lb/>
the appearance of <hi rend="italic">Moods</hi>, her fortunes <lb/>
were firmly established.</p>
<p>"I feel very moral to-day," she wrote to <lb/>
her sister, "having done a big wash alone, <lb/>
baked, swept the house, picked the hops, got <lb/>
dinner, and written a chapter in <hi rend="italic">Moods</hi>."</p>
<p>But her unselfish devotion to others <reg orig="shat-|tered">shattered</reg> <lb/>
her health and she was never quite <lb/>
so strong again. Disconsolately, for her, <lb/>
she wrote in her diary in 1872:</p>
<p>"Home again, and begin a new task. <lb/>
Twenty years ago, I resolved to make the <lb/>
family independent if I could. At forty, <lb/>
this is done. Debts all paid, even the <lb/>
outlawed ones, and we have enough to be <lb/>
comfortable. It has cost me my health, <lb/>
perhaps, but as I still live, there is more for <lb/>
me to do, I suppose."</p>
<pb n="157" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0226"/>
<p>No wonder the weary worker, having <lb/>
accomplished her long task, should write <lb/>
thus. The mountain-climber, when first <lb/>
reaching the summit, does not immediately <lb/>
begin to enjoy the view, but, after rest <lb/>
from exhausting effort, when the free <lb/>
air of heaven revives him, and sustained <lb/>
by the knowledge of work well done, he <lb/>
may look about him and say, "I am <lb/>
glad."</p>
<p>Twenty-five fine volumes, reaching at <lb/>
last that coveted dignity of authorship, a <lb/>
uniform edition, represent to us Louisa <lb/>
Alcott's earthly work. From these, to <lb/>
her, during her lifetime, went about two <lb/>
hundred thousand dollars in royalties. <lb/>
She helped her sisters, took care of her <lb/>
father and mother, educated nephews <lb/>
and nieces&mdash;and spent very little upon <lb/>
herself.</p>
<p>The dear, impractical father, adoring to <lb/>
the last his "birthday-child," died only <lb/>
<pb n="158" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0227"/>
two or three days before she did, and his <lb/>
funeral occurred on the day she died. She <lb/>
did not know of his death, unless, beyond <lb/>
that mysterious grey veil which hides <lb/>
Eternity from us and which never parts <lb/>
save for a passage, he was waiting, with a <lb/>
smile upon his fine old face, to welcome his <lb/>
tired daughter home.</p>
<p>The thin, cold hands, crossed at last in <lb/>
perfect peace, have long since become part <lb/>
of the all-hiding, all-absolving dust, but <lb/>
their work lives on. Generations yet <lb/>
unborn shall laugh with her <hi rend="italic">Little Men;</hi> <lb/>
listen, by the firelight, to <hi rend="italic">Spinning Wheel <lb/>
Stories;</hi> cry over the dear dog who was lost <lb/>
in <hi rend="italic">Under the Lilacs;</hi> sit, enchanted, with <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Jack and Jill</hi> in the wonderful room Jack's <lb/>
mother fitted up for them, and grow to <lb/>
true womanhood by means of the yellowed, <lb/>
tear-stained pages of <hi rend="italic">Little Women.</hi></p>
<p>Grown to maturity, who shall not find <lb/>
the clock magically turned back by <reg orig="open-|ing">opening</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="159" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0228"/>
<hi rend="italic">Eight Cousins.</hi> Who shall not find <lb/>
once more the springtime joy of first love <lb/>
in <hi rend="italic">Rose in Bloom?</hi> And who, passing the <lb/>
heavily laden shelves of a crowded <reg orig="book-|store">bookstore</reg>, <lb/>
jaded past all expression and sick <lb/>
to death of the world and its ways, shall <lb/>
not look at life for an instant through her <lb/>
eyes at seeing the brown books which <lb/>
bear her name?</p>
<p>She wrote much, yet never a line that <lb/>
was unworthy, nor a sentence that was <lb/>
unclean. She taught, unfailingly, the <reg orig="gos-|pel">gospel</reg> <lb/>
of cheerfulness and courage, even in <lb/>
the midst of poverty and almost <reg orig="in-|credible">incredible</reg> <lb/>
toil. Thousands of men and <lb/>
women may date their high standards <lb/>
of life and conduct from the day that one <lb/>
of her simple stories first came into their <lb/>
hands.</p>
<p>Simply human, and therefore vital, her <lb/>
work has always the indefinable quality <lb/>
we call "charm." It is in itself the <lb/>
<pb n="160" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0229"/>
perfect portrayal of a sweet-souled, <reg orig="un-|selfish">unselfish</reg> <lb/>
woman, whose serenity could not be <lb/>
disturbed by adversity, and who met the <lb/>
world gallantly, with a smile.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">When</hi> the best-loved Queen of <reg orig="Eng-|land">England</reg> <lb/>
died, after reigning for more <lb/>
than fifty years, she left a precious legacy <lb/>
to all the women in the world. No one <lb/>
can read of her private life without <reg orig="mar-|velling">marvelling</reg> <lb/>
at her simplicity, wondering at <lb/>
her true greatness, and being glad that, <lb/>
Queen though she was, she found her <lb/>
greatest joy in husband and home.</p>
<p>"Take care of her," the Duke of Kent <lb/>
used to say, "for she will one day be Queen <lb/>
of England." This did not seem very <reg orig="pro-|bable">probable</reg>, <lb/>
for there were uncles and cousins <lb/>
between Victoria and the throne, and the <lb/>
father did not live to see his prophecy <lb/>
fulfilled.</p>
<p>The Queen's long life was probably due <lb/>
to her mother's wisdom in keeping her, <lb/>
<pb n="164" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0233"/>
almost from her birth, as much as possible <lb/>
in the open air. She had a donkey, gaily <lb/>
decorated with blue ribbons, which she <lb/>
used to ride; a garden which she cared for <lb/>
herself, and, on rainy days, she played <lb/>
with her dolls, of which she had almost <lb/>
a hundred and fifty.</p>
<p>She was taught to sew, to economise, to <lb/>
control her temper, to be gracious and <lb/>
tactful in manner, and, in less than a month <lb/>
after her eighteenth birthday, she ascended <lb/>
the throne.</p>
<p>King William IV. died at half-past two <lb/>
on the morning of June 20, 1837. At five <lb/>
o'clock, the Archbishop of Canterbury <reg orig="ap-|peared">appeared</reg> <lb/>
at Kensington Palace and asked to <lb/>
see "Her Royal Highness," saying that he <lb/>
had "important business." The attendant <lb/>
refused to disturb the Princess, who was <lb/>
sleeping calmly. "But," replied the <reg orig="Arch-|bishop">Archbishop</reg>, <lb/>
"we are come on business of state <lb/>
to the <hi rend="italic">Queen!</hi>"</p>

<p>Within a few moments, sleepy, <reg orig="fright-|ened">frightened</reg>, <lb/>
hesitating, Victoria entered the room <lb/>
in her nightgown, with a shawl wrapped <lb/>
around her. Her nightcap had fallen off <lb/>
and her hair hung loosely over her <reg orig="shoul-|ders">shoulders</reg>. <lb/>
Tears were in her eyes, and her <reg orig="slip-|pered">slippered</reg> <lb/>
feet tapped the floor nervously.</p>
<p>After the Archbishop told her that she <lb/>
was now Queen of England, her first words <lb/>
were, "I beg your grace to pray for me." <lb/>
Then she wrote a note of condolence to <lb/>
Queen Adelaide, addressing it to "Her <lb/>
Majesty, the Queen." "But you are <lb/>
Queen," she was reminded. "Yes," she <lb/>
answered, "but the widowed Queen is not <lb/>
to be first reminded of it by me."</p>
<p>Before noon of the same day, she <lb/>
attended the Council in the palace, <reg orig="choos-|ing">choosing</reg> <lb/>
to come in alone, rather than attended <lb/>
by the officers of state.</p>
<p>The next day she was proclaimed <lb/>
Queen from the open window of St. <lb/>
<pb n="166" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0237"/>
James's Palace. She was dressed in deep <lb/>
mourning and the tears ran down her <lb/>
cheeks when Lord Melbourne presented <lb/>
her to the waiting crowd as their sovereign.</p>
<p>Within a week she went to Parliament, <lb/>
gowned magnificently in crimson velvet <lb/>
trimmed with gold and ermine, hung over <lb/>
a white brocade petticoat embroidered <lb/>
in gold. She wore a tiara, bracelets, <lb/>
necklace, and stomacher of diamonds, and <lb/>
her carriage was drawn by eight white <lb/>
horses, attended by a full military escort. <lb/>
She made her speech dissolving <reg orig="Parlia-|ment">Parliament</reg> <lb/>
from a throne of crimson velvet and <lb/>
gold, with the royal mantle of purple <lb/>
velvet held over her shoulders by the <lb/>
lords-in-waiting.</p>
<p>She continued to rise at six in the <reg orig="morn-|ing">morning</reg>, <lb/>
as had been her habit, and to have a <lb/>
lady-in-waiting read to her while her hair <lb/>
was being dressed. She refused to sign <lb/>
any paper until she had thoroughly <reg orig="mas-|tered">mastered</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="167" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0238"/>
the contents, and, in one busy year <lb/>
of her reign, she read and signed over <lb/>
twenty-eight thousand state documents.</p>
<p>A year after she first ascended the throne, <lb/>
she was crowned in state in Westminster <lb/>
Abbey. The old crown of England weighed <lb/>
almost seven pounds and she declared <lb/>
that it was too heavy for her, so a smaller, <lb/>
lighter one was made, set with nearly <lb/>
three thousand diamonds and the <reg orig="magnifi-|cent">magnificent</reg> <lb/>
ruby worn by Henry V. at Agincourt.</p>
<p>When she dismounted from the state <lb/>
carriage, cannon thundered and trumpets <lb/>
sounded. Her train, of crimson velvet <lb/>
and gold, was carried by eight young <lb/>
peeresses. After music, prayers, and a <lb/>
sermon, the Queen took the oath, kneeling. <lb/>
Afterward, while cloth of gold was held over <lb/>
her head by four Knights of the Garter, <lb/>
she was anointed with holy oil by the <lb/>
Archbishop of Canterbury, invested with <lb/>
the imperial robe and ring and sceptre, <lb/>
<pb n="168" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0239"/>
and when she bent to have the crown placed <lb/>
on her head, all the peers and peeresses <lb/>
put on their coronets, crying, "God save <lb/>
the Queen!"</p>
<p>Taking off her crown again, she was <lb/>
given the sacrament, and shortly afterward <lb/>
she drove back to the palace through <lb/>
streets well-nigh impassable. Her <reg orig="fav-|ourite">favourite</reg> <lb/>
spaniel was barking when she drove <lb/>
up. "There's Dash," she cried in <reg orig="plea-|sure">pleasure</reg>, <lb/>
forgetting for the moment the solemn <lb/>
ceremony through which she had just <lb/>
passed.</p>
<p>Cloth of gold and ermine and <reg orig="magnifi-|cent">magnificent</reg> <lb/>
robes of state were not to the young <lb/>
Queen's taste. She went to the opera, once, <lb/>
dressed in a simple white cotton gown, <lb/>
with pale blue ribbons in her hair. She <lb/>
wore white by preference, with a simple <lb/>
hat.</p>
<p>Kings and Queens and officers of state <lb/>
were at this time endeavouring to find a <lb/>
<pb n="169" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0240"/>
suitable husband for her. Wearying of <lb/>
their continual arguments in favour of this <lb/>
candidate and that, she finally announced <lb/>
that she would exercise her Royal <reg orig="preroga-|tive">prerogative</reg> <lb/>
and choose her own husband.</p>
<p>Her choice, as the world knows, was <lb/>
Prince Albert. Immediately after their <lb/>
engagement, he wrote to his grandmother <lb/>
thus:</p>
<p>"The Queen sent for me alone to her <lb/>
room a few days ago, and declared to me, in <lb/>
a genuine outburst of love and affection, <lb/>
that I had gained her whole heart and <lb/>
would make her intensely happy if I would <lb/>
make the sacrifice of sharing her life with <lb/>
her, for she said she looked on it as a <lb/>
sacrifice; the only thing which troubled <lb/>
her was that she did not think she was <lb/>
worthy of me. The joyous openness of <lb/>
manner in which she told this quite <lb/>
enchanted me, and I was quite carried <lb/>
away by it. &hellip; Since that moment, <lb/>
<pb n="170" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0241"/>
Victoria does whatever she fancies I <lb/>
should wish or like and we talk together <lb/>
a great deal about our future life, which <lb/>
she promises me to make as happy as <lb/>
possible."</p>
<p>Victoria, meanwhile, was writing to <lb/>
her uncle: "My mind is quite made up <lb/>
and I told Albert this morning of it. The <lb/>
warm affection he showed me on learning <lb/>
this gave me great pleasure. He seems <lb/>
perfection and I think that I have the <lb/>
prospect of very great happiness before me. <lb/>
&hellip; I love him more than I can say. &hellip; <lb/>
These last few days have passed like a <lb/>
dream to me; and I am so much bewildered <lb/>
by it all that I know hardly how to write, <lb/>
but I do feel very happy."</p>
<p>They were married in February, in St. <lb/>
James's Palace, the bride wearing white <lb/>
satin and orange blossoms, with a <reg orig="magni-|ficent">magnificent</reg> <lb/>
veil of Honiton lace. When her <lb/>
husband's people went home, she wrote in <lb/>
<pb n="171" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0242"/>
her diary: "Oh, how I feel for my dearest, <lb/>
precious husband at this moment. Father, <lb/>
brother, friends, country&mdash;all he has left <lb/>
and all for me. God grant that I may be <lb/>
the happy person, the most happy person, <lb/>
to make this dearest, blessed being happy <lb/>
and contented. What is in my power to <lb/>
make him happy, I will do."</p>
<p>Victoria kept her word nobly, as became <lb/>
a Queen. For twenty-one years they <lb/>
lived together in perfect happiness. Being <lb/>
the husband of a Queen is not, in itself, <lb/>
a position to be envied by any man, but <lb/>
the Prince Consort conducted himself <lb/>
with such nobility and tact that he soon <lb/>
won the hearts of all about him and was <lb/>
second only to the Queen herself in the <lb/>
affections of the people.</p>
<p>Nine children were born to them, and <lb/>
all were christened in the same cap and <lb/>
gown of Honiton lace. After the birth <lb/>
of the first son, the Queen wrote to her <lb/>
<pb n="172" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0243"/>
uncle: "I wonder very much whom our <lb/>
little boy will be like. You will <reg orig="under-|stand">understand</reg> <lb/>
how fervent are my prayers&mdash;and I <lb/>
am sure everybody's must be&mdash;to see him <lb/>
resemble his father in every respect, both <lb/>
in body and mind. Oh, my dearest uncle, <lb/>
I am sure if you knew how happy, how <lb/>
blessed, I feel, and how proud in possessing <lb/>
such a perfect being as my husband, and <lb/>
if you think you have been instrumental in <lb/>
bringing about this union, it must gladden <lb/>
your heart."</p>
<p>When Prince Albert was twenty-eight, <lb/>
he was made Chancellor of the <reg orig="Uni-|versity">University</reg> <lb/>
of Cambridge, and was obliged to <lb/>
read his speech to the Queen, who sat on <lb/>
the throne in the great hall&mdash;a <reg orig="circum-|stance">circumstance</reg> <lb/>
very embarrassing to both. "I <lb/>
cannot say," said the Queen, "how it <lb/>
agitated and embarrassed me to have to <lb/>
receive this address, and hear it read by <lb/>
my beloved Albert, who walked in at <lb/>
<pb n="173" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0244"/>
the head of the University, and who <lb/>
looked dear and beautiful in his robes."</p>
<p>After twenty-one years of married life, <lb/>
the Queen wrote to her uncle: "On Sunday <lb/>
we celebrated, with feelings of deep <reg orig="grati-|tude">gratitude</reg> <lb/>
and love, the twenty-first anniversary <lb/>
of our blessed marriage.&hellip; Very few can <lb/>
say with me that their husband, at the end <lb/>
of twenty-one years, is not only full of <lb/>
the friendship, kindness, and affection, <lb/>
which a truly happy marriage brings with <lb/>
it, but of the same tender love as in the <lb/>
very first days of our marriage."</p>
<p>Late in 1861, the same year in which the <lb/>
above letter was written, the Prince <lb/>
Consort died after a brief illness caused <lb/>
by overwork and a cold. After the first <lb/>
terrible grief was over, the Queen said <lb/>
sadly: "There is no one to call me Victoria <lb/>
now." All through her life&mdash;and perhaps <lb/>
still&mdash;a memorial service was held at his <lb/>
tomb on the anniversary of his death.</p>
<pb n="174" entity="Reed_HappyWomen_0245"/>
<p>It was five years after his death before <lb/>
she personally opened Parliament again. <lb/>
The robes of state were laid upon a chair <lb/>
near her and the Lord Chancellor read her <lb/>
speech. She wore a simple robe of dark <lb/>
purple with a cap of white lace.</p>
<p>Many years afterward, she joined her <lb/>
beloved husband in death, becoming more <lb/>
eager for the meeting toward the end. <lb/>
Aside from her great and lasting service <lb/>
of state to England, the whole world <lb/>
has reason to be grateful to her for her <lb/>
shining example as wife and mother, to <lb/>
be which is, indeed, "more than queen."</p>
