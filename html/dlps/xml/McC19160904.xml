        		</opener>
        		
            <p>
            Thanks old pal for the long
            and enjoyable letter of Friday.
            </p><p>
            So you tracked down the 
            famous Falconie.  Sorry we won’t have
            a chance to realize on our investment
            before she goes to Madrid.
            </p><p>
            Heard from good, old Grundy.  Hope
            Munsey has sense enough to keep him.
            </p><p>
            I’m very much better as far
            as the ball is concerned but my
            back has not improved to any marked
            degree.  I get massages, but inspite [sic] of
            these the pain keeps on.  The boss
            speaks of sending me to a hospital,
            God knows where.  Its mighty kind
            of you to invite me to get well
            Chez vous and I appreciate it immensely
            &mdash; only it isn’t possible.  They wouldn’t
            give me leave.  I’ll probably see you
            tho [sic] for I’ll have to go thru [sic] Paris
            to rejoin escadrille which, as you know,
            is leaving Bar.  Its the only route
            from here to northern points.  Don’t
            mention this to our young lady friends
            for if I only have a day I would
            rather spend it with you and don’t
            want Marcelle et al to be offended.  M
            
            <pb n="[p.2]"/>
            
            has been mighty nice &mdash; send me
            books and magazines but I have
            so much reading matter now I’m
            swamped.
            </p><p>
            All right, I’ll cook you up
            a letter on the depot d’eclope.
            Rather interesting I think too.  Will
            have to wait until I’m sitting up.
            </p><p>
            By the time you get thru [sic] with
            me in the American papers I’ll have
            a line up a’ la Hobson.
            </p><p>
            Who are the two worthies that claim
            to have flown in France and who are
            now back in the states instructing
            eleve [sic] pilots and drawing down $150 per
            week?  There’s a fake some place.  Something
            ought to be done about it.  One is
            Phil Rader I think.  They say they served
            with France and are at Newport News
            training school.  Go to it old hound.
            </p><p>
            I keep getting annoying letters
            from my mother asking me to
            consent to her obtaining a release
            for me and this last letter, which
                        
            <pb n="[p.3]"/>
            
            gives me the dope on the two above
            mentioned lads, asks me to cable.
            She sent me a check which she
            insists on my keeping, so I guess
            I’ll have to cable.  Will you please
            do it for me and I’ll pay you
            when I pass through.  The cable 
            goes to my brother in law, whose
            cable address is: 
            Adfol
            Chicago
            
            Just say:  Letter received, will not contemplate
            release.              Jim
            </p><p>
            Tell Marcelle she missed her
            greatest joy in life by not
            sleeping with the Russian.  She
            would have had her extasy [sic], and
            then been disillusioned &mdash; so that
            she would have had no regrets
            at not marrying him.
            </p><p>
            Skipper, the good old soul has
            kept me posted re the doings
            of the crowd and has attended
            to my junk and the moving
            there of.
            </p><p>
            The concert Sunday was great.
            I was put in officers’ row.
            One chap, a soldier who was a 
            singer and dancer at the Olympia
            got off a delightful ditty about
                        
            <pb n="[p.4]"/>
            
            picking up a queen on his permission
            and getting a frightful and torturing
            dose.  The doctor in Paris was for
            cutting off the tool but he returned 
            an front and goes to a depot 
            d’eclopes.  There was a surprising
            amount of appreciative guffaws which
            would lead me to infer that several
            of the gentlemen here have had 
            unwise love affairs.
            </p><p>
            I suppose Kiffin will be with
            you on the 6th.  Give him
            my regards, and write soon &mdash;
            its a great cheer.
            </p>
