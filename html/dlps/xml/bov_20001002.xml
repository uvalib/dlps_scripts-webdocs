                <p> The Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia conducted a meeting by
                    telephone on Monday, <date value="2000-10-02">October 2, 2000</date>; <name>John
                        P. Ackerly, III</name>, Rector, presided. The meeting, which began at 9:05
                    a.m., was in Open Session and members of the public were invited to listen to
                    the proceedings by speakerphone, which was set up in the Board office at the
                    Rotunda.</p>
                <p> The Rector, <name type="present">Mr. Crutchfield and Mr. Phelan</name> were
                    present in Madison Hall for the meeting; <name type="present">Mr. Goodwin and
                        Mr. Wheat</name> were in Mr. Goodwin's office in Richmond.</p>

                    participated on their own telephones.</p>
                <p>
                    <name type="present">Mr. Casteen, Mr. Sandridge, Mr. Gilliam, Ms. Sheehy, Mr.
                        Forch and Ms. Bailes</name> also were participants.</p>
                <p> The Rector asked <name>Mr. Sandridge</name> to present the Agenda.</p>
                <p>
                    <name>Mr. Sandridge</name> explained that the University's proposed amendments
                    to the state budget are due in Richmond on <date value="2000-10-04">October 4<hi
                            rend="super">th</hi></date>, the day before the beginning of the
                    scheduled meeting of the Board of Visitors on <dateRange from="2000-10-05"
                        to="2000-10-06">October 5<hi rend="super">th</hi> and 6<hi rend="super"
                            >th</hi></dateRange>. As the Board had expressed its desire to approve
                    the amendments &mdash; and the University did not receive guidelines from the
                    state on amendments until August 16<hi rend="super">th</hi> &mdash; before they
                    are sent to Richmond, the telephonic meeting was called.</p>
                <p>Referring to material which had been sent to the Board before the meeting,
                        <name>Mr. Sandridge</name> gave a quick overview of the proposed amendments.
                    (The amendments are appended to these Minutes as an attachment.) </p>
                <p> Mr. Bliley moved that the amendments be approved; Mr. Crutchfield seconded the
                    motion. The Secretary established by roll call vote that all participating
                    Members approved the resolution. </p>

                            outpatient PPS, the rules also established complex requirements for
