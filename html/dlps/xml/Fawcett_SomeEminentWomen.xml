<head>PREFACE</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> following short sketches of the lives of some of the <lb/>
eminent women of our times were written for <hi rend="italic">The Mothers' <lb/>
Companion,</hi> and are now republished by the kind <reg orig="permis-|sion">permission</reg> <lb/>
of the proprietors and publishers, Messrs. Partridge.</p>
<p>They were suggested by the fact that nearly all the <lb/>
best contributions of women to literature have been made <lb/>
during the last hundred years, and simultaneously with <lb/>
this remarkable development of literary activity among <lb/>
women, there has been an equally remarkable activity in <lb/>
spheres of work held to be peculiarly feminine. So far, <lb/>
therefore, from greater freedom and better education <reg orig="en-|couraging">encouraging</reg> <lb/>
women to neglect womanly work, it has caused <lb/>
them to apply themselves to it more systematically and <lb/>
more successfully. The names of Elizabeth Fry, Mary <lb/>
Carpenter, Sarah Martin, Agnes Jones, Florence <reg orig="Nightin-|gale">Nightingale</reg>, <lb/>
and Sister Dora are a proof of this. I believe that <lb/>
we owe their achievements to the same impulse which in <lb/>
another kind of excellence has given us Jane Austen, <lb/>
Charlotte Bront&euml;, and Elizabeth Browning.</p>
<p>The sketches were intended chiefly for working women <lb/>
and young people; it was hoped it would be an <reg orig="encourage-|ment">encouragement</reg> <lb/>
to them to be reminded how much good work had <lb/>
been done in various ways by women.</p>
<pb n="vi" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0015"/>
<p>An apology should, perhaps, be offered to the reader <lb/>
for the want of arrangement in the sequence of these <lb/>
sketches. As they appeared month by month, in 1887 <lb/>
and 1888, the incidents of the day sometimes suggested <lb/>
the subject. Thus the papers on Queen Victoria and on <lb/>
Queen Louisa of Prussia were suggested by the celebration <lb/>
of the Jubilee in June 1887, and by the universal grief <lb/>
felt for the death of Queen Louisa's son and grandson in <lb/>
1888. As the incidents mentioned in some sketches are <lb/>
sometimes referred to in those that follow, it has been <lb/>
thought best not to alter the sequence in which they <lb/>
originally appeared. The authorities relied on are quoted <lb/>
in each paper.</p>

<epigraph>
<cit>
<q>"Humanity is erroneously considered among the commonplace virtues. <lb/>
If it deserved such a place there would be less urgent need than, alas! <lb/>
there is for its daily exercise among us. In its pale shape of kindly <lb/>
sentiment and bland pity it is common enough, and is always the portion <lb/>
of the cultivated. But humanity armed, aggressive, and alert, never <lb/>
slumbering and never wearying, moving like an ancient hero over the land <lb/>
to slay monsters, is the rarest of virtues."</q>

</epigraph>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> present century is one that is distinguished by the <lb/>
active part women have taken in careers that were <reg orig="pre-|viously">previously</reg> <lb/>
closed to them. Some people would have us <lb/>
believe that if women write books, paint pictures, and <lb/>
understand science and ancient languages, they will cease <lb/>
to be true women, and cease to care for those womanly <lb/>
occupations and responsibilities that have always been <lb/>
entrusted to them. This is an essentially false and <reg orig="mis-|taken">mistaken</reg> <lb/>
notion. True cultivation of the understanding <lb/>
makes a sensible woman value at their real high worth <lb/>
all her womanly duties, and so far from making her <lb/>
neglect them, causes her to appreciate them more highly <lb/>
than she would otherwise have done. It has always been <lb/>
held&mdash;at least, in Christian countries&mdash;that the most <lb/>
womanly of women's duties are to be found in works of <lb/>
mercy to those who are desolate and miserable. To be <lb/>
thirsty, hungry, naked, sick, or in prison, is to have a <lb/>
<pb n="2" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0019"/>
claim for compassion and comfort upon womanly pity and <lb/>
tenderness. And we shall see, if we look back over recent <lb/>
years, that never have these womanly tasks been more <lb/>
zealously fulfilled than they have been in the century <lb/>
which has produced Elizabeth Fry, Florence Nightingale, <lb/>
Josephine Butler, and Octavia Hill.</p>
<p>Mrs. Fry was born before the beginning of this century <lb/>
&mdash;in 1780&mdash;but the great public work with which her <lb/>
memory will always be connected was not begun till about <lb/>
1813. She was born of the wealthy Quaker family, the <lb/>
Gurneys of Norwich. Her parents were not very strict <lb/>
members of the sect to which they belonged, for they <lb/>
allowed their children to learn music and dancing&mdash;pursuits <lb/>
that were then considered very worldly even by many who <lb/>
did not belong to the Society of Friends. The gentle poet, <lb/>
William Cowper, speaks in one of his letters, written about <lb/>
the time of Elizabeth Fry's childhood, of love of music as <lb/>
a thing which tends "to weaken and destroy the spiritual <lb/>
discernment." Mr. and Mrs. Gurney, however, seem to <lb/>
have been very free from such prejudices, as well as from <lb/>
others which were much more universal, for their children <lb/>
not only learnt music and dancing, but also&mdash;girls as well <lb/>
as boys&mdash;Latin and mathematics.</p>
<p>Mrs. Gurney seems to have discerned that she had an <lb/>
especial treasure in her little Elizabeth. She is spoken of <lb/>
in her mother's journal as "my dove-like Betsy." The <lb/>
authoress of the biography of Elizabeth Fry in the <lb/>
Eminent Women series, says: "Her faculty for <reg orig="independ-|ent">independent</reg> <lb/>
investigation, her unswerving loyalty to duty, and <lb/>
her fearless perseverance in works of benevolence, were all <lb/>
foreshadowed" in her childhood. She had as a young girl <lb/>
what appears to us now a very extraordinary dread of <reg orig="en-|thusiasm">enthusiasm</reg> <lb/>
in religion. One would think that if ever a <lb/>
woman needed enthusiasm for her life's work, Elizabeth <lb/>
Fry was that woman. But she confesses in her journal, <lb/>
written when she was seventeen years of age, "the greatest <lb/>
fear of religion" because it is generally allied with <reg orig="en-|thusiasm">enthusiasm</reg>. <lb/>
Perhaps the truth is that she had so deep a <lb/>
<pb n="3" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0020"/>
natural fount of enthusiasm in her heart that she dreaded <lb/>
the work that it would impel her to, when once it was <lb/>
allowed a free course. She had a very strong, innate <lb/>
repugnance to anything which drew public attention upon <lb/>
herself, and only the imperative sense of duty enabled her <lb/>
to overcome this feeling. In her heart she said what her <lb/>
Master had said before her: "Father, if it be possible, let <lb/>
this cup pass from me."</p>
<p>When the sphere of public duty first revealed itself to <lb/>
her, she records in her diary what it cost her to enter upon <lb/>
it, and writes of it as "the humiliating path that has <reg orig="ap-|peared">appeared</reg> <lb/>
to be opening before me." It must be noticed, <lb/>
however, that in her case, as always, the steep and difficult <lb/>
path of duty becomes easier to those who do not flinch <lb/>
from it. In a later passage of her diary, the public work <lb/>
which she had at first called a path of humiliation she <lb/>
speaks of as "this great mercy."</p>
<p>In the little book to which reference has just been <lb/>
made, we read that the first great change in Elizabeth <lb/>
Gurney's life was caused by the deep impression made <lb/>
upon her by the sermons of William Savery. It is rather <lb/>
strange to find the girl who had such a terror of <reg orig="enthu-|siasm">enthusiasm</reg>, <lb/>
weeping passionately while William Savery was <lb/>
preaching. Her sister has described what took place. <lb/>
"Betsy astonished us all by the great feeling she showed. <lb/>
She wept most of the way home. &hellip; What she went <lb/>
through in her own mind I cannot say; but the results <lb/>
were most powerful and most evident" &lpar;p. 11, <hi rend="italic">Elizabeth</hi> <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Fry</hi>. By Mrs. E. R. Pitman&rpar;. Her emotion was not of <lb/>
the kind that passes away and leaves no trace behind. <lb/>
The whole course of her life and tenor of her thoughts <lb/>
were changed. She became a strict Quakeress, not, <reg orig="how-|ever">however</reg>, <lb/>
without some conflict with herself. There are <lb/>
pleasant little touches of human nature in the facts that <lb/>
she found it a trial to say "thee" and "thou," and to give <lb/>
up her scarlet riding habit. Soon after this, at the age of <lb/>
twenty, she became the wife of Mr. Joseph Fry, and <reg orig="re-|moved">removed</reg> <lb/>
to London, where she lived in St. Mildred's Court, <lb/>
<pb n="4" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0021"/>
in the City. The family into which she married were <lb/>
Quakers, like her own, but of a much more severe and <lb/>
strict kind. Her marriage was, however, in every respect <lb/>
a fortunate one. Her husband sympathised deeply with <lb/>
her in all her efforts for the good of others, and encouraged <lb/>
her in her public work, although many in the Society of <lb/>
Friends did not scruple to protest that a married woman <lb/>
has no duties except to her husband and children. Her <lb/>
journal shows how anxiously she guarded herself against <lb/>
any temptation to neglect her home duties. She was a <lb/>
tender and devoted mother to her twelve children, and it <lb/>
was through her knowledge of the strength of a mother's <lb/>
love that she was able to reach the hearts of many of the <lb/>
poor prisoners whom she afterwards helped out of the <lb/>
wretchedness into which they had fallen.</p>
<p>Her study of the problem, how to help the poor, began <lb/>
in this way. A beggar-woman with a child in her arms <lb/>
stopped her in the street. Mrs. Fry, seeing that the child <lb/>
had whooping-cough and was dangerously ill, offered to go <lb/>
with the woman to her home in order more effectually to <lb/>
assist her. To Mrs. Fry's surprise, the woman immediately <lb/>
tried to make off; it was evident what she wanted was a <lb/>
gift of money, not any help to the suffering child. Mrs. <lb/>
Fry followed her, and found that her rooms were filled <lb/>
with a crowd of farmed-out children in every stage of <reg orig="sick-|ness">sickness</reg> <lb/>
and misery; the more pitiable the appearance of one <lb/>
of these poor mites, the more useful an implement was it in <lb/>
the beggar's stock-in-trade. From this time onwards the <lb/>
condition of women and children in the lowest and most <lb/>
degraded of the criminal classes became the study of Mrs. <lb/>
Fry's life. She had the gift of speech on any subject which <lb/>
deeply moved her. From about 1809 she began to speak <lb/>
at the Friends' meeting-house. This power of speaking, as <lb/>
well as working, enabled her to draw about her an active <lb/>
band of co-workers. When she first began visiting the <lb/>
female prisoners in Newgate it is probable that she could <lb/>
not have supported all that she had to go through if it had <lb/>
not been for the sympathy and companionship of Anna <lb/>
<pb n="5" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0022"/>
Buxton and other Quaker ladies whom she had roused <lb/>
through her power of speech, just as she had herself been <lb/>
roused when a girl by the preaching of William Savery.</p>
<p>The condition of the women and children in Newgate <lb/>
Prison, when Mrs. Fry first began visiting them in 1813, <lb/>
was more horrible than anything that can be easily <lb/>
imagined. Three hundred poor wretches were herded <reg orig="to-|gether">together</reg> <lb/>
in two wards and two cells, with no furniture, no <lb/>
bedding of any kind, and no arrangements for decency or <lb/>
privacy. Cursing and swearing, foul language, and <reg orig="per-|sonal">personal</reg> <lb/>
filthiness, made the dens in which the women were <lb/>
confined equally offensive to ear, eye, nose, and sense of <lb/>
modesty. The punishment of death at that time existed <lb/>
for 300 different offences, and though there were many <lb/>
mitigations of the sentence in the case of those who had <lb/>
only committed minor breaches of the law, yet the fact <lb/>
that nearly all had by law incurred the penalty of death, <lb/>
gave an apparent justification for herding the prisoners <reg orig="in-|discriminately">indiscriminately</reg> <lb/>
together. It thus happened that many a <lb/>
poor girl who had committed a comparatively trivial <lb/>
offence, became absolutely ruined in body and mind <lb/>
through her contact in prison with the vilest and most <lb/>
degraded of women. No attempt whatever was made to <lb/>
reform or discipline the prisoners, or to teach them any <lb/>
trade whereby, on leaving the gaol, they might earn an <lb/>
honest livelihood. Add to this that there were no female <lb/>
warders nor female officers of any kind in the prison, and <lb/>
that the male warders were frequently men of depraved <lb/>
life, and it is not difficult to see that no element of <reg orig="de-|gradation">degradation</reg> <lb/>
was wanting to make the female wards of <reg orig="New-|gate">Newgate</reg> <lb/>
what they were often called&mdash;a hell on earth.</p>
<p>When Elizabeth Fry and Anna Buxton first visited this <lb/>
Inferno, there was so little pretence at any kind of control <lb/>
over the prisoners, that the Governor of Newgate advised <lb/>
the ladies to leave their watches behind them at home. <lb/>
Mrs. Fry, with a wise instinct, felt that the best way of <lb/>
influencing the poor, wild, rough women was to show her <lb/>
care for their children. Many of the prisoners had their <lb/>
<pb n="6" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0023"/>
children with them in gaol, and there were very few even <lb/>
of the worst who could not be reached by care for their <lb/>
little ones. Even those who had no children were often <lb/>
not without the motherly instinct, and could be roused to <lb/>
some measure of self-restraint and decency for the sake of <lb/>
the children who were being corrupted by their example. <lb/>
So Mrs. Fry's first step towards reforming the women took <lb/>
the form of starting a school for the children in the prison. <lb/>
As usual in all good work of a novel kind, those who knew <lb/>
nothing about it were quite sure that Mrs. Fry would have <lb/>
been much more usefully employed if she had turned her <lb/>
energies in a different direction. People who have never <lb/>
stirred a finger to lighten the misery of mankind always <lb/>
know, so much better than the workers, what to do and <lb/>
how to do it. They would probably tell a fireman who is <lb/>
entering a burning house at the risk of his life, that he <lb/>
would be more usefully employed in studying the chemical <lb/>
action of fire, or in pondering over the indestructibility of <lb/>
matter. The popular feeling with regard to Mrs. Fry's <lb/>
work in Newgate was embodied by Thomas Hood in a <lb/>
ballad which is preserved in his collected works, and serves <lb/>
now to show how wrong a good and tender-hearted man may <lb/>
be in passing judgment on a work of the value of which he <lb/>
was entirely unqualified to form an opinion. The refrain <lb/>
of the poem is "Keep your school out of Newgate, Mrs. <lb/>
Fry"&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="stanza">
<l>I like the pity in your full-brimmed eye.</l>
<l>I like your carriage and your silken gray,</l>
<l>Your dove-like habits and your silent preaching,</l>
<l>But I <hi rend="italic">don't</hi> like your Newgatory teaching.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>No, I'll be your friend, and like a friend</l>
<l>Point out your very worst defect. Nay, never</l>
<l>Start at that word! But I must ask you why</l>
<l>You keep your school in Newgate, Mrs. Fry.</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>Mrs. Fry's philanthropy was not of a kind to be checked <lb/>
by a ballad, and she went on perseveringly with her work; <lb/>
the school was formed, and a prisoner, named Mary Cormor, <lb/>
<pb n="7" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0024"/>
was the first schoolmistress. A wonderful change gradually <lb/>
became apparent in the demeanour, language, and <reg orig="appear-|ance">appearance</reg> <lb/>
of the women in prison. In 1817 an association <lb/>
was formed for carrying on the work Mrs. Fry had begun. <lb/>
It was called "An Association for the Improvement of the <lb/>
Female Prisoners in Newgate." Its first members were <lb/>
eleven Quakeresses and one clergyman's wife. Public <lb/>
attention was now alive to the importance of the work; <lb/>
and in the following year a Select Committee of the House <lb/>
of Commons was appointed to inquire and report upon the <lb/>
condition of the London prisons. Mrs. Fry was examined <lb/>
before this committee. Her chief recommendations were <lb/>
that the prisoners should be employed in some industry, <lb/>
and be paid for their work, and that good conduct should <lb/>
be encouraged by rewards; she was also most urgent that <lb/>
the women prisoners should be in the charge of women <lb/>
warders. Her work in the prison naturally led her to <lb/>
consider the condition and ultimate fate of women who <lb/>
were transported. Transportation was then carried out <lb/>
upon a large scale, and all the evils of the prison existed <lb/>
in an intensified form on board the transport ships. The <lb/>
horrors of the voyage were followed by a brutal and <lb/>
licentious distribution of the women on their arrival to <lb/>
colonists, soldiers, and convicts, who went on board and <lb/>
took their choice of the human cargo. Mrs. Fry's efforts <lb/>
resulted in a check being placed on these shameful <reg orig="bar-|barities">barbarities</reg>. <lb/>
The women were, owing to her exertions, sent <lb/>
out in charge of female warders, and they were provided <lb/>
with decent accommodation on their arrival.</p>
<p>Like Howard, Mrs. Fry did not confine her efforts to <lb/>
the poor and wretched of her own country. She visited <lb/>
foreign countries in order thoroughly to study various <lb/>
methods of prison work and discipline. On one occasion <lb/>
she found in Paris a congenial task in bringing the force of <lb/>
public opinion to bear on the treatment of children in the <lb/>
Foundling Hospital there. The poor babies were done up <lb/>
in swaddling clothes that were only unwrapped once in <lb/>
twelve hours. There was no healthy screaming in the <lb/>
<pb n="8" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0025"/>
wards, only a sound that a hearer compared to the faint <lb/>
and pitiful bleating of lambs. A lady who visited the <lb/>
hospital said she never made the round of the spotlessly <lb/>
clean white cots, without finding at least one dead baby! <lb/>
Everything in the hospital was regulated by clockwork; its <lb/>
outward appearance was clean and orderly in the extreme, <lb/>
but the babies died like flies! The Archbishop of Paris <lb/>
was vastly annoyed with Mrs. Fry for pointing out this <lb/>
drawback to the perfect organisation of the institution; <lb/>
but when once the light was let in, improvement followed.</p>
<p>There were many other classes of neglected or <reg orig="unfortu-|nate">unfortunate</reg> <lb/>
people whose circumstances were improved by Mrs. <lb/>
Fry's exertions. The lonely shepherds of Salisbury Plain <lb/>
were provided with a library after she had visited the <reg orig="deso-|late">desolate</reg> <lb/>
region where they lived. She also organised a lending <lb/>
library for coastguardsmen and for domestic servants. <lb/>
There was no end to her active exertions for the good of <lb/>
others except that of her life.</p>
<p>She died at Ramsgate in 1845, and was buried at <reg orig="Bark-|ing">Barking</reg>.</p>
<p>Her private life was not without deep sorrows and <lb/>
anxieties. She lost a passionately beloved child in 1815; <lb/>
in 1828 her husband was unfortunate in his business affairs. <lb/>
They suffered from a great diminution of fortune, and <lb/>
were obliged to remove to a smaller house and adopt a less <lb/>
expensive style of living. She did not pretend to any <reg orig="in-|difference">indifference</reg> <lb/>
she was far from feeling under these trials; but <lb/>
they were powerless to turn her from the duties which she <lb/>
had marked out for herself. The work which she had <lb/>
undertaken for the good of others probably became, in its <lb/>
turn, her own solace and support in the hour of trial and <lb/>
affliction. In helping others she had unconsciously built <lb/>
up a strong refuge for herself, thus giving a new illustration <lb/>
to the truth of the words: "He that findeth his life shall lose <lb/>
it: and he that loseth his life, for my sake, shall find it."</p>

</epigraph>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Mary Carpenter</hi> was thirty-eight years old when Mrs. <lb/>
Fry died in 1845. We do not hear, in reading the lives <lb/>
of either, that the two women ever met, or that the elder <lb/>
directly stimulated the activity of the younger. Yet the <lb/>
one most surely prepared the way for the other; their <lb/>
work was upon the same lines, and Miss Carpenter, the <lb/>
Unitarian, of Bristol, was the spiritual heir and successor <lb/>
of Mrs. Fry, the Quaker, of Norwich.</p>
<p>There is, it is true, a contrast in the manner in which <lb/>
the two women approached their work in life. The aim <lb/>
of both was the rescue of what Mary Carpenter called "the <lb/>
perishing and dangerous classes." But while Mrs. Fry was <lb/>
led, through her efforts on behalf of convicts, to establish <lb/>
schools for them and their children, Mary Carpenter's first <lb/>
object was the school for neglected children, and through <lb/>
the knowledge gained there she was led to form schemes <lb/>
for the reformation of criminals and for a new system of <lb/>
prison discipline. Mrs. Fry worked through convicts to <lb/>
schools; Mary Carpenter through schools to convicts.</p>
<p>It will not therefore be imagined that there is any want <lb/>
of appreciation of Mrs. Fry when it is said that Mary <lb/>
Carpenter's labours were more effective, inasmuch as they <lb/>
<pb n="10" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0027"/>
were directed to the cause of the evil, rather than to its <lb/>
results. By establishing reformatory and industrial schools, <lb/>
and by obtaining, after long years of patient effort, the <lb/>
sanction and support of Parliament for them, she virtually <lb/>
did more than had up to that time ever been done in <lb/>
England, to stop the supply of criminals. Children who <lb/>
were on the brink of crime, and those who had actually <lb/>
fallen into criminal courses, were, through her efforts, <lb/>
snatched away from their evil surroundings, and helped <lb/>
to become respectable and industrious men and women. <lb/>
Before her time, magistrates and judges had no choice, <lb/>
when a child criminal stood convicted before them, but to <lb/>
sentence him to prison, whence he would probably come <lb/>
out hopelessly corrupted and condemned for life to the <lb/>
existence of a beast of prey. She says, in one of her <lb/>
letters, dated 1850: "A Bristol magistrate told me that <lb/>
for twenty years he had felt quite unhappy at going on <lb/>
committing these young culprits. And yet he had <hi rend="italic">done</hi> <lb/>
nothing!" The worse than uselessness of prisons for <lb/>
juvenile offenders was a fact that was burnt into Mary <lb/>
Carpenter's mind and heart by the experience of her life. <lb/>
She was absolutely incapable of recognising the evil and <lb/>
at the same time calmly acquiescing in it. Her magisterial <lb/>
friend is the type of the common run of humanity, who <lb/>
satisfy their consciences by saying, "Very grievous! very <lb/>
wrong!" and who do nothing to remove the grievance and <lb/>
the wrong; she is the type of the knights - errant of <lb/>
humanity, who never see a wrong without assailing it, and <lb/>
endeavouring to remove the causes which produce it.</p>
<p>Mary Carpenter was born at Exeter in 1807, the eldest <lb/>
of five children, several of whom have left their mark on <lb/>
the intellectual and moral history of this century. There <lb/>
was all through her life a great deal of the elder sister&mdash; <lb/>
one may almost say, of the mother&mdash;in Mary Carpenter. <lb/>
In an early letter her mother speaks of the wonderfully <lb/>
tranquillising influence of dolls on her little Mary. She <lb/>
never shrank from responsibility, and she had a special <lb/>
capacity for protecting love&mdash;a capacity that stood her in <lb/>
<pb n="11" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0028"/>
good stead in reclaiming the little waifs and strays to whom <lb/>
she afterwards devoted herself. Her motherliness comes <lb/>
out in a hundred ways in the story of her life. Her <reg orig="end-|less">endless</reg> <lb/>
patience with the truant and naughty children was <lb/>
such as many a real mother might envy. She was <reg orig="especi-|ally">especially</reg> <lb/>
proud of the title of "the old mother" which the <lb/>
Indian women, whom she visited towards the close of her <lb/>
life, gave her. In writing to a friend, she once said: <lb/>
"There is a verse in the prophecies, 'I have given thee <lb/>
children whom thou hast not borne,' and the motherly love <lb/>
of my heart has been given to many who have never known <lb/>
before a mother's love." She adopted a child in 1858 to <lb/>
be a daughter to her, and writes gleefully: "Just think of <lb/>
me with a little girl of <hi rend="italic">my own!</hi> about five years old, <reg orig="ready-|made">readymade</reg> <lb/>
to my hand, without the trouble of marrying&mdash;a <lb/>
darling little thing, an orphan," etc. etc. Her friends <lb/>
spoke of her eager delight in buying the baby's outfit.</p>
<p>It was her motherliness that made her so successful <lb/>
with the children in the reformatories and industrial <lb/>
schools; moreover, the children believed in her love for <lb/>
them. One little ragged urchin told a clergyman that <lb/>
Miss Carpenter was a lady who gave away all her money <lb/>
for naughty boys, and only kept enough to make herself <lb/>
clean and decent. On one occasion she heard that two of <lb/>
her ex-pupils had "got into trouble," and were in prison <lb/>
at Winchester. She quickly found an opportunity of <lb/>
visiting them, and one of them exclaimed, directly he saw <lb/>
her, "Oh! Miss Carpenter, I knew you would not desert <lb/>
us!"</p>
<p>Another secret of her power, and also of her elasticity <lb/>
of spirit, was her sense of humour. It was like a silver <lb/>
thread running through her laborious life, saving her from <lb/>
dulness and despondency. In one of her reports, which <lb/>
has to record the return of a runaway, she said: "He <lb/>
came back resembling the prodigal in everything except <lb/>
his repentance!"</p>
<p>The motto which she especially made her own was <hi rend="italic">Dum</hi> <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">doceo disco&mdash;While I teach, I learn</hi>. Her father had a <lb/>
<pb n="12" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0029"/>
school for boys in Bristol, and Mary and her sister were <lb/>
educated in it. They were among the best of their father's <lb/>
pupils, one of whom, the Rev. James Martineau, has left a <lb/>
record of the great impression Mary's learning made upon <lb/>
him. She was indeed very proficient in many branches of <lb/>
knowledge. Her education included Latin, Greek, <reg orig="mathe-|matics">mathematics</reg>, <lb/>
and natural history; and the exactness which her <lb/>
father and the nature of her studies demanded of her, <lb/>
formed a most invaluable training for her after career. <lb/>
For many years the acquisition of knowledge, for its own <lb/>
sake, was the chief joy of her life; but a time came when <lb/>
it ceased to satisfy her. She was rudely awakened from <lb/>
the delightful dreams of a student's life by a severe <reg orig="visita-|tion">visitation</reg> <lb/>
of cholera at Bristol in 1832. From this period, and <lb/>
indeed from a special day&mdash;that set apart as a fast-day in <lb/>
consequence of the cholera&mdash;dates a solemn dedication of <lb/>
herself to the service of her fellow-creatures. She wrote <lb/>
in her journal 31st March 1832, what her resolution was, <lb/>
and concluded: "These things I have written to be a <lb/>
witness against me, if ever I should forget what ought to <lb/>
be the object of all my active exertions in life." These <lb/>
solemn self-dedications are seldom or never spoken of by <lb/>
those who make them. Records of them are found <reg orig="some-|times">sometimes</reg> <lb/>
in journals long after the hand that has written them <lb/>
is cold. But, either written or unwritten, they are <reg orig="prob-|ably">probably</reg> <lb/>
the rule rather than the exception on the part of <lb/>
those who devote themselves to the good of others. The <lb/>
world has recently learned that this was the case with <lb/>
Lord Shaftesbury. There is a time when the knight-errant <lb/>
consciously enrols himself a member of the noble band of <lb/>
warriors against wrong and oppression, and takes upon <lb/>
himself his baptismal vow&mdash;manfully to fight against sin, <lb/>
the world, and the devil, and to continue Christ's faithful <lb/>
soldier and servant to his life's end.</p>
<p>It must be remembered that when Mary Carpenter first <lb/>
began to exert herself for the benefit of neglected children, <lb/>
there were no reformatory or industrial schools, except those <lb/>
which had been established by the voluntary efforts of <lb/>
<pb n="13" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0030"/>
philanthropists like herself. Aided by a band of <reg orig="fellow-|workers">fellowworkers</reg> <lb/>
and wise advisers, chief of whom were Mr. <lb/>
Matthew Davenport Hill, the Recorder of Birmingham, and <lb/>
his daughters; Dr. Tuckerman, of the U.S.A.; Mr. Russell <lb/>
Scott, of Bath; Mr. Sheriff Watson, of Aberdeen; and <lb/>
Lady Byron, Mary Carpenter set to work to establish a <lb/>
voluntary reformatory school at Kingswood, near Bristol. <lb/>
Her principle was that by surrounding children, who would <lb/>
otherwise be criminals, with all the influences of a <reg orig="whole-|some">wholesome</reg> <lb/>
home life, there was a better chance than by any <lb/>
other course, of reclaiming these children, and making them <lb/>
useful members of society. To herd children together <lb/>
in large, unhomelike institutions, was always, in Mary <lb/>
Carpenter's view, undesirable; the effect on character is <lb/>
bad; the more perfectly such places are managed, the more <lb/>
nearly do the children in them become part of a huge <lb/>
machine, and the less are their faculties, as responsible <lb/>
human beings, developed. Over and over again, in books, <lb/>
in addresses, and by the example of the institutions which <lb/>
she managed herself, Mary Carpenter reiterated the lesson <lb/>
that if a child is to be rescued and reformed, he must be <lb/>
placed in a family; and that where it is necessary, for the <lb/>
good of society, to separate children on account of their <lb/>
own viciousness, or that of their parents, from their own <lb/>
homes, the institutions receiving them should be based on <lb/>
the family ideal so far as possible. With this end in view, <lb/>
the children at Kingswood were surrounded by as many <lb/>
home influences as possible. Miss Carpenter at one time <lb/>
thought of living there herself, but this scheme was given <lb/>
up, in deference to her mother's wishes. She was, however, <lb/>
a constant visitor, and a little room, which had once been <lb/>
John Wesley's study, was fitted up as a resting-place for <lb/>
her. On a pane of one of the windows of this room her <lb/>
predecessor had written the words, "God is here." She <lb/>
taught the children herself, and provided them with rabbits, <lb/>
fowls, and pigs, the care of which she felt would exercise a <lb/>
humanising influence upon them. The whole discipline of <lb/>
the place was directed by her; one of her chief difficulties <lb/>
<pb n="14" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0031"/>
was to get a staff of assistants with sufficient faith in her <lb/>
methods to give them an honest trial. She did not believe <lb/>
in a physical force morality. "We must not attempt," she <lb/>
wrote, "to <hi rend="italic">break</hi> the will, but to train it to govern itself <lb/>
wisely; and it must be our great aim to call out the good, <lb/>
which exists even in the most degraded, and make it <reg orig="con-|quer">conquer</reg> <lb/>
the bad." After a year's work at Kingswood in this <lb/>
spirit, she writes very hopefully of the improvement already <lb/>
visible in the sixteen boys and thirteen girls in her charge. <lb/>
The boys could be trusted to go into Bristol on messages, <lb/>
and even "thievish girls" could be sent out to shops with <lb/>
money, which they never thought of appropriating.</p>
<p>But although the success of the institution was so <lb/>
gratifying, it had no legal sanction; it had consequently <lb/>
no power to deal with runaways, and the great mass of <lb/>
juvenile delinquents were still sentenced to prisons, from <lb/>
which they emerged, like the man into whom seven devils <lb/>
entered, in a state far worse than their first. Mary <lb/>
Carpenter's work was not only to prove the success of her <lb/>
methods of dealing with young criminals, but, secondly, to <lb/>
convince the Government that the established system was <lb/>
a bad one, and thirdly, and most difficult of all, to get them <lb/>
to legislate on the subject. A long history of her efforts <lb/>
to obtain satisfactory legislation for children of the <reg orig="perish-|ing">perishing</reg> <lb/>
and dangerous classes is given in her life, written by <lb/>
her nephew, Mr. J. Estlin Carpenter. It is enough here <lb/>
to say that in the House of Lords, Lord Shaftesbury, and <lb/>
in the House of Commons, Sir Stafford Northcote and Mr. <lb/>
Adderley &lpar;afterwards Lord Iddesleigh and Lord Norton&rpar;, <lb/>
were her chief supporters. Mr. Lowe &lpar;now Lord Sherbrooke&rpar; <lb/>
was her chief opposer. Liberal as she was, born and bred, <lb/>
as well as by heart's conviction, she confessed with some <lb/>
feeling of shame, that the Tories "are best in <hi rend="italic">this</hi> work." <lb/>
At last, in 1854, her efforts were crowned with success, <lb/>
and the Royal Assent was given to the Youthful Offenders <lb/>
Bill, which authorised the establishment of reformatory <lb/>
schools, under the sanction of the Home Secretary.</p>
<p>It is a striking proof of the change that has taken place <lb/>
<pb n="15" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0032"/>
in the sphere and social status of women, that Mary <lb/>
Carpenter, in the first half of her active life, suffered what <lb/>
can be called nothing less than anguish, from any effort <lb/>
which demanded from herself the least departure from <lb/>
absolute privacy. When she began her work of convincing <lb/>
the public and Parliament of the principles which ought to <lb/>
govern the education of juvenile criminals, her nephew <lb/>
writes that to have spoken at a conference in the presence <lb/>
of gentlemen, she would have felt, at that time &lpar;1851&rpar;, as <lb/>
tantamount to unsexing herself. When she was called <lb/>
upon to give evidence before a Select Committee of the <lb/>
House of Commons in 1852, her profound personal timidity <lb/>
made the occasion a painful ordeal to her, which she was <lb/>
only enabled to support by the consciousness of the needs <lb/>
of the children. Surely this excessive timidity arises from <lb/>
morbid self-consciousness, rather than from true womanly <lb/>
modesty. Mary Carpenter was enabled, by increasing <lb/>
absorption in her work, to throw it off, and for her work's <lb/>
sake she became able to speak in public with ease and <reg orig="self-|possession">self-possession</reg>. <lb/>
She frequently spoke and read papers at the <lb/>
Social Science Congresses, and at meetings of the British <lb/>
Association. A letter from her brother Philip describes <lb/>
one of these occasions, at the meeting in 1860 of the <lb/>
British Association at Oxford, when her subject was, <lb/>
"Educational Help from the Government Grant to the <lb/>
Destitute and Neglected Children of Great Britain."</p>

<p>"There was a great gathering of celebrities to hear her. <lb/>
It was in one of the ancient schools or lecture-halls, which <lb/>
was crowded, evidently not by the curious, but by those who <lb/>
really wanted to know what she had to say. She stood up <lb/>
and read in her usual clear voice and expressive <reg orig="enuncia-|tion">enunciation</reg>. <lb/>
&hellip; It was, I suppose, the first time a woman's <lb/>
voice had read a lecture there before dignitaries of <lb/>
learning and the Church; but as there was not the <lb/>
slightest affectation on the one hand, so on the other hand <lb/>
there was neither a scorn nor an etiquettish politeness; <lb/>
<pb n="16" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0033"/>
but they all listened to her as they would have listened <lb/>
to Dr. Rae about Franklin, only with the additional <lb/>
feeling &lpar;expressed by the President, Mr. Nassau Senior&rpar; <lb/>
that it was a matter of heart and duty, as well as head."</p>
<p>As years passed by, her work and responsibilities <lb/>
rapidly increased. It is astonishing to read of the number <lb/>
of institutions, from ragged schools upwards, of which she <lb/>
was practically the head and chief. Her thoroughly <lb/>
practical and business-like methods of work, as well as her <lb/>
obvious self-devotion and earnestness, ensured to her a <lb/>
large share of public confidence and esteem, and although <lb/>
she was a Unitarian, sectarian prejudices did not often <lb/>
thwart her usefulness. Two instances to the contrary must, <lb/>
however, be given. In 1856 the Somersetshire magistrates <lb/>
at the Quarter Sessions at Wells refused to sanction the <lb/>
Girls' Reformatory, established by Miss Carpenter at the <lb/>
Red Lodge, Bristol, on account of the religious opinions of <lb/>
its foundress. They appeared to have forgotten that <lb/>
"Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is <lb/>
this, to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, <lb/>
and to keep himself unspotted from the world." A more <lb/>
deeply and truly religious spirit than Mary Carpenter's <lb/>
never existed; but that is the last thing that sectarian <lb/>
rancour takes heed of. The other little bit of persecution <lb/>
she met with was regarded by herself and her friends as <lb/>
something between a compliment and a joke. In 1864 she <lb/>
wrote a book entitled <hi rend="italic">Our Convicts</hi>. The work was <reg orig="re-|ceived">received</reg> <lb/>
with commendation by jurists in France, Germany, <lb/>
and the United States, but the crowning honour of all was <lb/>
that the Pope placed her and her books on the "Index <lb/>
Expurgatorius." After this she felt that if she had lived <lb/>
in earlier times she might have aspired to the crown of <lb/>
martyrdom.</p>
<p>The extraordinary energy and vitality of Mary Carpenter <lb/>
never declined. When she was over sixty years of age she <lb/>
made four successive visits to India, with the double object <lb/>
of arousing public opinion there about the education of <lb/>
women, and the condition of convicts, especially of female <lb/>
<pb n="17" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0034"/>
convicts. At the age of sixty-six she visited America. <lb/>
She had long been deeply interested in the social and <lb/>
political condition of the United States, and had many warm <lb/>
personal friends there. Her first impulse to reformatory <lb/>
work had come from an American citizen, Dr. Tuckerman; <lb/>
her sympathy and help had been abundantly bestowed upon <lb/>
the Abolitionist party, and she was of course deeply <reg orig="thank-|ful">thankful</reg> <lb/>
when the Civil War in America ended as it did in the <lb/>
victory of the North, and in the complete abolition of negro <lb/>
slavery in the United States. Her mind remained vigorous <lb/>
and susceptible to new impressions and new enthusiasms <lb/>
to the last. Every movement for elevating the position of <lb/>
women had her encouragement. She frequently showed <lb/>
her approval of the movement for women's suffrage by <lb/>
signing petitions in its favour, and was convinced that <lb/>
legislation affecting both sexes would never be what it <lb/>
ought to be until women as well as men had the power of <lb/>
voting for Members of Parliament. In 1877, within a <lb/>
month of her death, she signed the memorial to the Senate <lb/>
of the London University in favour of the admission of <lb/>
women to medical degrees.</p>
<p>She passed away peacefully in her sleep, without <reg orig="pre-|vious">previous</reg> <lb/>
illness or decline of mental powers, in June 1877, <lb/>
leaving an honoured name, and a network of institutions <lb/>
for the reform of young criminals, and the prevention of <lb/>
crime, of which our country will for many years to come <lb/>
reap the benefit.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Every</hi> one knows the fame of Sir William Herschel, the <lb/>
first distinguished astronomer of that name, the builder <lb/>
and designer of the forty-foot telescope, and the discoverer <lb/>
of the planet, called after George III., Georgium Sidus. <lb/>
Hardly less well known is the name of his sister, Caroline <lb/>
Herschel, who was her brother's constant helper for fifty <lb/>
years. She was the discoverer of eight comets; she <lb/>
received, for her distinguished services to science, the gold <lb/>
medal of the Royal Astronomical Society, and the gold <lb/>
medal conferred annually by the King of Prussia for <lb/>
science; she was also made an honorary member of the <lb/>
Royal Astronomical Society and of the Royal Irish Academy, <lb/>
and received many other public marks of appreciation of <lb/>
the value of her astronomical labours. Few women have <lb/>
done as much as she for the promotion of science, and few <lb/>
have been more genuinely humble in their estimate of their <lb/>
own attainments. Nothing made her more angry than <lb/>
any praise which appeared, even in the slightest degree, to <lb/>
detract from the reputation of her brother; over and over <lb/>
again she asserted that she was nothing more than a tool <lb/>
which he had taken the trouble to sharpen. One of her <lb/>
<pb n="19" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0036"/>
favourite expressions about herself was that she only <lb/>
"minded the heavens" for her brother. "I am nothing," <lb/>
she wrote; "I have done nothing: all I am, all I know, I <lb/>
owe to my brother. I am only a tool which he shaped to his <lb/>
use&mdash;a well-trained puppy-dog would have done as much."</p>
<p>Scientific men and scientific societies did not endorse <lb/>
Caroline Herschel's extremely humble estimate of herself. <lb/>
In the address to the Astronomical Society by Mr. South, <lb/>
on presenting the medal to Miss Herschel in 1828, the <lb/>
highest praise was conferred upon her as her brother's <lb/>
fellow-worker, and as an original observer. "She it was," <lb/>
said Mr. South, "who reduced every observation, made <lb/>
every calculation; she it was who arranged everything in <lb/>
systematic order; and she it was who helped him &lpar;Sir W. <lb/>
Herschel&rpar; to obtain his imperishable name. But her claims <lb/>
to our gratitude do not end here: as an original observer <lb/>
she demands, and I am sure she has, our unfeigned thanks." <lb/>
He then narrates the series of her astronomical discoveries, <lb/>
and adds, referring to the brother and sister: "Indeed, in <lb/>
looking at the joint labours of these extraordinary <reg orig="person-|ages">personages</reg>, <lb/>
we scarcely know whether most to admire the <reg orig="intel-|lectual">intellectual</reg> <lb/>
power of the brother, or the unconquerable industry <lb/>
of his sister."</p>
<p>The sharpest tool, or the best-trained puppy-dog in the <lb/>
world, could hardly have earned such praise as this. <lb/>
Without endorsing what Caroline said of herself in her <lb/>
generous wish to heighten the fame of her brother, it must, <lb/>
however, be conceded that in a remarkable degree she was <lb/>
what he made her. With an excellent, and indeed an <lb/>
exceptionally powerful, natural understanding, she was <lb/>
ready to apply it in any direction her brother chose. She <lb/>
was far from being a mere tool, but her mind resembled a <lb/>
fine musical instrument upon which her brother was able to <lb/>
play the lightest air or the grandest symphony, according <lb/>
as he pleased. At his bidding she became, first, a prima <lb/>
donna, then an astronomer; if he had so wished it, she <lb/>
would probably with equal readiness and versatility have <lb/>
turned her attention to any other branch of science or art. <lb/>
<pb n="20" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0037"/>
Caroline Herschel was, indeed, a fine example of what <lb/>
devoted love can do to elevate the character and develop <lb/>
the natural capacity of the understanding.</p>
<p>She was born in Hanover on the 16th March 1750, the <lb/>
youngest but one of six children. Her exceptionally long life <lb/>
of nearly ninety-eight years closed in January 1848. Her <lb/>
memory, therefore, included the earthquake of Lisbon, the <lb/>
whole French Revolution, the meteor-like rise and fall of <lb/>
Napoleon, and all the history of modern Europe to the eve <lb/>
of the socialistic outbreak of 1848. Her family life, before <lb/>
she left Germany, was of the narrowest possible kind. She <lb/>
had only one sister, seventeen years older than herself; <lb/>
and as Sophia Herschel married early, Caroline became the <lb/>
only girl in her family circle, and to the full was she kept <lb/>
to those exclusively feminine pursuits and occupations <lb/>
which the proprieties of Germany at that time enforced. <lb/>
Her mother appears to have been enthusiastically opposed <lb/>
to the education of girls. Her father wished to give her a <lb/>
good education, but the mother insisted that nothing of <lb/>
the kind should be attempted. How she learned to read <lb/>
and write we are not told in the biography written by her <lb/>
grand-niece, Mrs. J. Herschel. These accomplishments <lb/>
were by no means common among German women of the <lb/>
humbler middle class a hundred years ago. She did, <reg orig="how-|ever">however</reg>, <lb/>
acquire them, in spite of her mother's decree that two <lb/>
or three months' training in the art of making household <lb/>
linen was all the education that Caroline required. Her <lb/>
father, who was a professional musician himself, wished to <lb/>
teach her music, but could only do so by stealth, or by <lb/>
taking advantage of half an hour now and then, when his <lb/>
wife was in an exceptionally good temper. In a letter, <lb/>
written when she was eighty-eight years old, Caroline <lb/>
recalls these furtive hours stolen from the serious <reg orig="occupa-|tions">occupations</reg> <lb/>
of her life, which then consisted in sewing, "<reg orig="orna-|mental">ornamental</reg> <lb/>
needlework, knitting, plaiting hair, and stringing <lb/>
beads and bugles." "It was my lot," she writes, "to be <lb/>
the Cinderella of the family. &hellip; I could never find time <lb/>
for improving myself in many things I knew, and which, <lb/>
<pb n="21" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0038"/>
after all, proved of no use to me afterwards, except what <lb/>
little I knew of music &hellip; which my father took a pleasure <lb/>
in teaching me&mdash;<hi rend="italic">N.B., when my mother was not at home. <lb/>
Amen."</hi></p>
<p>Very early in her life her brother William became <lb/>
Caroline's idol and hero. He was twelve years older than <lb/>
herself, and distinguished himself among the group of <lb/>
brothers for tenderness and kindness to the little maiden. <lb/>
Her eldest brother, Jacob, was a fastidious gentleman, and <lb/>
Caroline's inability to satisfy his requirements for nicety at <lb/>
table and as a waitress, often earned her a whipping. <lb/>
But her brother William's gentility was of a different order. <lb/>
She narrates one instance, which doubtless was a specimen <lb/>
of others, when "My dear brother William threw down <lb/>
his knife and fork and ran to welcome and crouched down <lb/>
to me, which made me forget all my grievances." Little <lb/>
did William or Caroline guess that in the kind brother <lb/>
soothing the little sister's trouble, the future astronomer <lb/>
was "sharpening the tool" that was hereafter to be of such <lb/>
inestimable service to him.</p>
<p>The connection of England and Hanover under one <lb/>
crown caused an intimate association between the two <lb/>
countries. William Herschel's first visit to England was <lb/>
as a member of the band of the regiment of which his <lb/>
father was bandmaster. On this first visit to England, <lb/>
William expended his little savings in buying Locke's <lb/>
"Essay on the Human Understanding." Jacob made an <lb/>
equally characteristic purchase of specimens of English <lb/>
tailoring art. These professional journeys to England led, <lb/>
in the course of time, to William Herschel establishing <reg orig="him-|self">himself</reg> <lb/>
as a music-master and professional musician at Bath. <lb/>
This, however, he very early regarded merely as a means <lb/>
to an end. He taught music to live, but he lived for his <lb/>
astronomical studies and for the inventions and <reg orig="improve-|ments">improvements</reg> <lb/>
in telescopes which he afterwards introduced to the <lb/>
world. When Caroline was seventeen years old, her <lb/>
father died, leaving his family very ill provided for; <lb/>
Caroline was more closely than ever confined to the tasks <lb/>
<pb n="22" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0039"/>
of a household drudge and to endeavouring to supply <reg orig="home-|made">homemade</reg> <lb/>
luxuries for Jacob. This went on for five years, the <lb/>
mother and sister slaving night and day in order that Jacob <lb/>
might cut a figure in the world not humbling to the family <lb/>
pride. In 1772 William Herschel unexpectedly arrived <lb/>
from England, and his short visit ended in his sister <reg orig="Caro-|line">Caroline</reg> <lb/>
returning with him to Bath. She left, as she writes <lb/>
with some awe, even after an interval of many years, "<reg orig="with-|out">without</reg> <lb/>
receiving the consent of my eldest brother to my going."</p>
<p>There could not possibly be a greater contrast than that <lb/>
between Caroline's life in Hanover and her life in England. <lb/>
From being a maid-of-all-work in a not very interesting <lb/>
family, where there was a dull monotony in her daily <lb/>
routine of drudgery, she found she was to become a public <lb/>
singer, an astronomer's apprentice, and an assistant <reg orig="manu-|facturer">manufacturer</reg> <lb/>
of scientific instruments; she was not only her <lb/>
brother's housekeeper, but his helper and coadjutor in every <lb/>
act of his life. Nothing is more remarkable than the <lb/>
account of the life of William and Caroline Herschel at <lb/>
Bath. He frequently gave from thirty-five to forty <reg orig="music-|lessons">musiclessons</reg> <lb/>
a week; this, with his work as director of public <lb/>
concerts, kept the wolf from the door, and, needless to say, <lb/>
occupied his daylight hours with tolerable completeness. <lb/>
The nights were given to "minding the heavens," or to <lb/>
making instruments necessary for minding them much <lb/>
more efficiently than had hitherto been possible. Every <lb/>
room in the house was converted into a workshop. <lb/>
William Herschel literally worked on, night and day, <lb/>
without rest, his sister on several occasions keeping him <lb/>
alive by putting bits of food into his mouth while he was <lb/>
still working. Once when he was finishing a seven-foot <lb/>
mirror for his telescope, he never took his hands from it <lb/>
for sixteen hours. The great work of constructing the <lb/>
forty-foot telescope took place at Bath; and at Bath also, <lb/>
while still practising the profession of a music-master, <lb/>
Herschel discovered the Georgium Sidus, and was <reg orig="acknow-|ledged">acknowledged</reg> <lb/>
as the leading authority on astronomy in England.</p>
<p>Up to the time of Herschel's improvements, six or eight <lb/>
<pb n="23" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0040"/>
inches used to be considered a large size for the mirror of <lb/>
an astronomical telescope. His first great telescope had a <lb/>
twelve-foot mirror. There is a most exciting account in <lb/>
Mrs. Herschel's Life of Caroline Herschel, of the failure of <lb/>
the first casting of the mirror for the thirty-foot reflector. <lb/>
The molten metal leaked from the vessel containing it and <lb/>
fell on the stone floor, pieces of which flew about in all <lb/>
directions as high as the ceiling. The operators fortunately <lb/>
escaped without serious injury. "My poor brother fell, <lb/>
exhausted with heat and exertion, on a heap of brickbats." <lb/>
The disappointment must have been intense, but nothing <lb/>
ever baffled these indefatigable workers, and the second <lb/>
casting was a complete success.</p>
<p>Five years after she had joined her brother at Bath, <lb/>
Caroline made her first appearance as a public singer. She <lb/>
was very successful, and her friends anticipated that her <lb/>
well-cultivated and beautiful voice would become a means <lb/>
of providing her with an ample income. She, however, had <lb/>
so fully identified herself with her brother's astronomical <lb/>
labours, that she only regarded her musical acquirements <lb/>
as a means of setting him free to devote himself more <lb/>
completely to the real object of his life. His fame as a <lb/>
maker of telescopes had by this time spread all over <lb/>
Europe, and many scientific societies, royal persons, and <lb/>
other celebrities, ordered telescopes of him. On these <lb/>
orders he was able to realise a large profit, but Caroline <lb/>
always grudged the time devoted to their execution. Her <lb/>
aim for her brother was not that he should become rich or <lb/>
even well-to-do, but that he should devote himself <reg orig="unre-|servedly">unreservedly</reg> <lb/>
to advance the progress of astronomical science. <lb/>
She was ready to live on a crust, and to give herself up to <lb/>
the most pinching economies and even privations, for this <lb/>
end. She was the keeper of her brother's purse, and <reg orig="re-|ceived">received</reg> <lb/>
his commands to spend therefrom anything that was <lb/>
necessary for herself; her thrift and self-denial may be <lb/>
judged from the fact that the sum thus abstracted for her <lb/>
own personal wants seldom amounted to more than &pound;7 or <lb/>
&pound;8 a year.</p>
<pb n="24" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0041"/>
<p>The next great change in the life of the brother and <lb/>
sister took place in 1782, when William Herschel left Bath <lb/>
and was appointed Astronomer-Royal by George the Third. <lb/>
His salary of only &pound;200 a year involved a great loss of <lb/>
income, but this, in his eyes, was a small matter in <reg orig="com-|parison">comparison</reg> <lb/>
with the advantage of having his time entirely free <lb/>
to give up to his favourite studies. They bade farewell to <lb/>
Bath, and settled first at Datchet, shortly after, however, <lb/>
removing to Slough. Caroline had dismal visions of <reg orig="bank-|ruptcy">bankruptcy</reg>, <lb/>
but William was in the highest spirits, and declared <lb/>
that they would live on eggs and bacon, "which would cost <lb/>
nothing to speak of, now that they were really in the <lb/>
country."</p>
<p>Caroline was now installed as an assistant astronomer, <lb/>
and was given a telescope, which she calls a "seven-foot <lb/>
Newtonian Sweeper"; and she was instructed, whenever she <lb/>
had an evening not in attendance on her brother, to "sweep <lb/>
for comets"; but her principal business appears, at this time, <lb/>
to have been waiting on her brother, and writing down the <lb/>
results of his observations; they worked quite as hard as <lb/>
they had done at Bath. They laboured at the manufacture <lb/>
of instruments all day, and at the observation of the heavens <lb/>
all night. No severity of weather, if the sky was clear, ever <lb/>
kept them from their posts. The ink often froze with which <lb/>
Caroline was writing down the results of her brother's <reg orig="obser-|vations">observations</reg>. <lb/>
It has been well said that if it had not been for <lb/>
occasional cloudy nights, they must have died of overwork. <lb/>
The apparatus for erecting the great forty-foot telescope, <lb/>
and the iron and woodwork for its various motions, were <lb/>
all designed by William Herschel, and fixed under his <reg orig="im-|mediate">immediate</reg> <lb/>
direction. His sister, in her <hi rend="italic">Recollections,</hi> wrote: <lb/>
"I have seen him stretched many an hour in the burning <lb/>
sun across the top beam, whilst the iron-work for the <lb/>
various motions was being fixed." The penurious salary <lb/>
granted to William Herschel was supplemented by special <lb/>
grants for the removal and the erection of all this machinery; <lb/>
and in 1787 Caroline's services to her brother were publicly <lb/>
recognised by her receiving the appointment of assistant to <lb/>
<pb n="25" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0042"/>
her brother at a salary of &pound;50 a year. She was at all times <lb/>
grateful to members of the royal family for acts of kindness <lb/>
shown by them to her brother and herself; but it is evident <lb/>
that she felt that, so far as money was concerned, she had <lb/>
not much cause for gratitude to the royal bounty. She <lb/>
points out that at the time when Parliament was granting <lb/>
George III. the sum of &pound;80,000 a year for encouraging <lb/>
science, &pound;200 was considered a sufficient salary for the <lb/>
first astronomer of the day; and yet money could flow <lb/>
liberally enough in some directions, for &pound;30,000 was at <lb/>
that time being spent on the altar-piece of St. George's <lb/>
Chapel, Windsor. Even Caroline's little salary of &pound;50 a <lb/>
year was not regularly paid. It was a trial to her again <lb/>
to become a pensioner on her brother's purse, and it was <lb/>
not till nine quarters of her official salary remained unpaid, <lb/>
that she reluctantly applied to him for help. No wonder <lb/>
that in reading, after her brother's death, an account of <lb/>
his life and its achievements, she remarks, "The favours <lb/>
of monarchs ought to have been mentioned, <hi rend="italic">but once would <lb/>
have been enough."</hi></p>
<p>It was after her brother's marriage, in 1788, that the <lb/>
majority of Caroline's astronomical discoveries were made. <lb/>
She discovered her first comet in 1786, her eighth and last <lb/>
in 1797. She was recognised as a comrade by all the <lb/>
leading astronomers of Europe, and received many letters <lb/>
complimenting her on her discoveries. One from De la <lb/>
Lande addressed her as "Savante Miss," while another <lb/>
from the Rev. Dr. Maskelyne saluted her as "My worthy <lb/>
sister in astronomy." Royal and other distinguished <lb/>
visitors constantly visited the wonderful forty-foot <reg orig="tele-|scope">telescope</reg> <lb/>
at Slough, and either William Herschel or his sister <lb/>
were required to be in attendance to explain its marvels. <lb/>
The Prince of Orange, on one occasion, called, and left an <lb/>
extraordinary message "to ask Mr. Herschel, or if he was <lb/>
not at home, Miss Herschel, if it was true that Mr. <reg orig="Her-|schel">Herschel</reg> <lb/>
had discovered a new star, whose light was not as <lb/>
that of the common stars, but with swallow-tails, as stars <lb/>
in embroidery." The only glimpse we get, through the <lb/>
<pb n="26" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0043"/>
peaceful labours of Caroline's long life, of the strife and <lb/>
turmoil of the French Revolution, is the note she makes of <lb/>
the visit, to her brother's observatory, of the Princesse de <lb/>
Lamballe. "About a fortnight after this," the diarist <reg orig="ob-|serves">observes</reg>, <lb/>
"her head was off." The absence of all comment <lb/>
upon the wonderful political events of the time is <reg orig="notice-|able">noticeable</reg>, <lb/>
and so also is Caroline's thinly-veiled contempt for <lb/>
any science less sublime than that to which she and her <lb/>
brother were devoted. Her youngest brother, Dietrich, was <lb/>
a student of the insect world. "He amuses himself with <lb/>
insects," she wrote to her nephew; "it is well he does not <lb/>
see the word <hi rend="italic">amuses,</hi> for whenever he catches a fly with a <lb/>
leg more than usual, he says it is as good as catching a <lb/>
comet." Her brother's marriage, though far from welcome <lb/>
at the time it took place, was a great blessing to her; for <lb/>
it gave her a most tender and affectionate sister, and <reg orig="ulti-|mately">ultimately</reg> <lb/>
a nephew, the inheritor of his father's great gifts, <lb/>
and the being to whom, after William Herschel's death in <lb/>
1822, Caroline transferred all the devoted and passionate <lb/>
attachment of which her nature was capable.</p>
<p>The great mistake of her life was going back to Germany <lb/>
after Sir W. Herschel's death in 1822. She was then <lb/>
seventy-two years of age, and the previous fifty years of <lb/>
her life, containing all her most precious memories and <lb/>
associations, had been spent in England. In this country, <lb/>
also, were all those who were dearest to her. Yet, no <lb/>
sooner was her brother dead, than she felt life in England <lb/>
to be an impossibility. She little thought that she had <lb/>
still twenty-six years to live; indeed she had long been <lb/>
under the impression that her end was near, but while her <lb/>
brother lived she kept this to herself, because she wished <lb/>
to be useful to him as long as she possibly could. She <lb/>
never really re-acclimatised herself to Germany. "Why <lb/>
did I leave happy England?" she often said. The one <lb/>
German institution she thoroughly enjoyed was the winter <lb/>
series of concerts and operas, which she constantly attended, <lb/>
and she mentions with pleasure, in her letters, that she <lb/>
was "always sure to be noticed by the Duke of Cambridge <lb/>
<pb n="27" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0044"/>
as his countrywoman, and that is what I want; I will be <lb/>
no Hanoverian." She laments the death of William IV., <lb/>
chiefly because, by causing a separation of the crowns of <lb/>
England and Hanover, it seemed to break a link between <lb/>
herself and the country of her adoption.</p>
<p>She never revisited England, but she kept up a constant <lb/>
communication with it by letters to her sister-in-law, her <lb/>
nephew, and later to her niece, Sir John Herschel's wife. <lb/>
At that time the post between London and Hanover was <lb/>
an affair of fifteen days, and letters were carried by a <lb/>
monthly messenger, of whose services she seldom failed to <lb/>
avail herself. She took the keenest interest in her nephew's <lb/>
distinguished career. His letters to her are full of <reg orig="as-|tronomy">astronomy</reg>. <lb/>
In 1832 he made a voyage to the Cape to <reg orig="ob-|serve">observe</reg> <lb/>
the stars in the Southern Hemisphere. When Miss <lb/>
Herschel first heard of the intended voyage she refused to <lb/>
believe it. But when she was really convinced of it, the <lb/>
old impulse was as strong upon her as upon a war-horse <lb/>
who hears the trumpet. "Ja! if I was thirty or forty <lb/>
years younger and could go too!" she exclaimed.</p>
<p>On 1st January 1840 the tube of the celebrated <reg orig="forty-|foot">fortyfoot</reg> <lb/>
telescope was closed with a sort of family celebration. <lb/>
A requiem, composed by Sir John Herschel for the occasion, <lb/>
was chanted, and he and Lady Herschel, with their seven <lb/>
children and some old servants, walked in procession round <lb/>
it, singing as they went. On hearing of this from Slough, <lb/>
Miss Herschel recalls that the famous telescope had also <lb/>
been inaugurated with music. "God save the King" had <lb/>
then been sung in it, the whole company from the <reg orig="dinner-|table">dinner-table</reg> <lb/>
mounting into the tube, and taking any musical <reg orig="instru-|ments">instruments</reg> <lb/>
they could get hold of, to form a band and orchestra.</p>
<p>The most laborious of all her undertakings she <reg orig="ac-|complished">accomplished</reg> <lb/>
after her brother's death. It was "The <lb/>
Reduction and Arrangement in the form of a catalogue, <lb/>
in Zones, of all the Star Clusters and Nebul&aelig;, observed <lb/>
by Sir W. Herschel in his Sweeps." It was for this that <lb/>
the gold medal of the Royal Astronomical Society was <lb/>
voted to her in 1828.</p>
<pb n="28" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0045"/>
<p>All through her life in Hanover she lived with the <lb/>
most careful economy, seldom or never consenting to draw <lb/>
upon Sir John Herschel for the annuity of &pound;100 that had <lb/>
been left her by her brother. She said it was impossible <lb/>
for her to spend more than &pound;50 a year without making <lb/>
herself ridiculous. The only luxuries she granted herself <lb/>
were her concert and opera tickets, and her English bed, <lb/>
which all sufferers from the inhuman German bedding <lb/>
must be thankful to hear she possessed. The self-<reg orig="forget-|fulness">forgetfulness</reg> <lb/>
and devotion to others which had characterised her <lb/>
in youth accompanied her to her grave. Every detail with <lb/>
regard to the disposition of her property and the <reg orig="arrange-|ments">arrangements</reg> <lb/>
for her funeral had been made by herself, with the <lb/>
view of giving as little trouble as possible to her nephew, <lb/>
and making the smallest encroachment upon his time. In <lb/>
her latest moments her only thought for herself was <reg orig="em-|bodied">embodied</reg> <lb/>
in a request that a lock of her beloved brother's <lb/>
hair might be laid with her in her coffin.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Every</hi> one of us has probably been tempted at one time <lb/>
or another to say or think when asked to join in some <lb/>
good work, "If only I had more time or more money, I <lb/>
would take it up." It is good for us, therefore, to be <lb/>
reminded that neither leisure nor wealth are necessary to <lb/>
those whose hearts are fixed upon the earnest desire to <lb/>
leave this world a little better and a little happier than <lb/>
they found it.</p>
<p>This lesson was wonderfully taught by Sarah Martin, a <lb/>
poor dressmaker, who was born at Caister, near Great <lb/>
Yarmouth, in 1791. In her own locality she did as great <lb/>
a work in solving the problems of prison discipline, and <lb/>
<pb n="30" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0047"/>
how to improve the moral condition of prisoners, as Mrs. <lb/>
Fry was doing about the same time upon a larger scale in <lb/>
London. It is very extraordinary that this poor woman, <lb/>
who was almost entirely self-educated, and who was <lb/>
dependent on daily toil for daily bread, should have been <lb/>
able, through her own mother-wit and native goodness of <lb/>
heart, to see the evil and provide the same remedies for it <lb/>
as were in course of time provided throughout the land, as <lb/>
the result of study given to the subject, by statesmen, <lb/>
philosophers, and philanthropists.</p>
<p>When Sarah Martin first began to visit the prison at <lb/>
Great Yarmouth, there was no sort of provision for the <lb/>
moral or educational improvement of the prisoners. There <lb/>
was no chaplain, there were no religious services, there <lb/>
was no school, and there was no employment of any kind, <lb/>
except what Satan finds for idle hands to do. The quiet, <lb/>
little, gentle-voiced dressmaker changed all this.</p>
<p>She was first led to visit the prison in 1819, through <lb/>
the compassionate horror which filled her when she heard <lb/>
of the committal to prison of a woman for brutally <reg orig="ill-|treating">illtreating</reg> <lb/>
her child. Without any introduction or <reg orig="recom-|mendation">recommendation</reg> <lb/>
from influential persons, she knocked timidly at <lb/>
the gate of the prison, and asked leave to see this woman. <lb/>
She had not told a single human creature of her intention, <lb/>
not even her grandmother, with whom she lived. She was <lb/>
fearful lest she should be overcome by the counsels of <lb/>
worldly wisdom that she had better mind her own business, <lb/>
that the woman's wickedness was no concern of hers, and <lb/>
so forth. Her first application at the gaol was unsuccessful; <lb/>
but she tried again, and the second time she was admitted <lb/>
without any question whatever. Once in the presence of <lb/>
the prisoner, the first inquiry by which she was met was a <lb/>
somewhat rough one as to the object of her visit. When <lb/>
the poor creature heard and felt all the deep compassion <lb/>
which had moved Sarah Martin to her side, she burst into <lb/>
tears, and with many expressions of contrition and <lb/>
gratitude besought her visitor to help her to be a better <lb/>
woman.</p>
<pb n="31" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0048"/>
<p>From the date of this visit, the best energies of Sarah <lb/>
Martin's life were devoted to improving the lot of the <lb/>
prisoners in Great Yarmouth Gaol. She did not&mdash;indeed, <lb/>
she could not&mdash;give up her dressmaking. She worked out <lb/>
at her customers' houses, earning about 1s. 3d. a day. <lb/>
Her first resolve was to give up always one day a week to <lb/>
her prison work, and as many other days as she could <lb/>
spare. She began teaching the prisoners to read and <lb/>
write; she also read to them, and told them stories. A <lb/>
deeply religious woman herself, it pained her that there <lb/>
were no services of any kind in the prison, and she <reg orig="pre-|vailed">prevailed</reg> <lb/>
upon the prisoners to gather together on Sunday <lb/>
mornings and read to one another. To encourage them in <lb/>
this she attended herself, not at first as the conductor of the <lb/>
service, but as a fellow-worshipper. This was very typical <lb/>
of her method and character. She was among them as one <lb/>
who served, not as one seeking power and authority. <reg orig="An-|other">Another</reg> <lb/>
illustration of this sweet humility in her character may <lb/>
be given. She wished those of her pupils who could read <lb/>
to learn each day a few Bible texts; and she always learned <lb/>
some herself, and said them with the prisoners. Sometimes <lb/>
an objection was made. In her own words, "Many said at <lb/>
first, 'It would be of no use,' and my reply was, 'It is of <lb/>
use to me, and why should it not be so to you? You have <lb/>
not tried it, but I have.'" There was a simplicity in this, a <lb/>
complete absence of the "Depart from me, for I am holier <lb/>
than thou," which was irresistible, and always silenced excuse.</p>
<p>Soon after the commencement of the Sunday services <lb/>
in the prison, it was found necessary, through the difficulty <lb/>
of finding a reader, that Sarah Martin herself should <lb/>
conduct the service. At first she used to read a sermon <lb/>
from a book, but later she wrote her own sermons, and <lb/>
later still she was able to preach without writing <reg orig="before-|hand">beforehand</reg>. <lb/>
According to the testimony of Captain Williams, <lb/>
the Inspector of Prisons for the district, the whole service <lb/>
was in a high degree reverent and impressive. The <lb/>
prisoners listened with deep attention to the clear, <lb/>
melodious voice of their self-appointed pastor.</p>
<pb n="32" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0049"/>
<p>At no time did she seek to obtain from the governor of <lb/>
the prison any authority over the prisoners; that is, she <lb/>
never sought to control them against their will; authority <lb/>
over them she had, but it was the authority which <lb/>
proceeded from her own personal influence. The prisoners <lb/>
did what she wished, because they knew her devotion to <lb/>
them. Her hold over them is best proved by the fact <lb/>
that never but once did she meet from them with <reg orig="any-|thing">anything</reg> <lb/>
that could be called rudeness or insult.</p>
<p>Next to her care for godliness and education, her chief <lb/>
thoughts were given to provide employment for the <lb/>
prisoners, first for the women, and then for the men. A <lb/>
gentleman gave her 10s., and in the same week another <lb/>
gave her &pound;1. Her gratitude for the possession of this <lb/>
small capital is touching to read of. She expended it in <lb/>
the purchase of materials for baby-clothes, and borrowing <lb/>
patterns, she set the women to work upon making little <lb/>
shifts and wrappers. The garments, when completed, <lb/>
were sold for the benefit of the women who had made <lb/>
them.</p>
<p>Her capital grew from thirty shillings to seven guineas, <lb/>
and in all more than &pound;400 worth of clothing, made in this <lb/>
way, was sold. The advantages were twofold. First, the <lb/>
women were employed and taught to sew, and secondly, <lb/>
each woman was enabled to earn a small sum, which was <lb/>
saved for her till the time of her release from prison. <lb/>
This money was frequently the means of giving the <lb/>
discharged prisoner a chance of starting a new life and <lb/>
gaining an honest livelihood.</p>
<p>Sarah Martin gave particular attention to this very <lb/>
important branch of her work. A man or a woman just <lb/>
out of prison, branded with all the stigma and disgrace of <lb/>
the gaol, is too often almost forced back into crime as the <lb/>
only means of livelihood. Endless were the devices and <lb/>
schemes which Sarah Martin employed to prevent this. <lb/>
She would seek out respectable lodgings for the prisoners <lb/>
on their discharge; she would see their former employers <lb/>
and entreat that another chance might be given; her <reg orig="note-|books">notebooks</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="33" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0050"/>
and diaries are filled with items of her own personal <lb/>
expenditure in setting up her poor clients with the small <lb/>
stock-in-trade or the tools necessary to start some simple <lb/>
business on their own account.</p>
<p>After many years of patient and devoted work she <lb/>
was well known throughout the whole town and <reg orig="neigh-|bourhood">neighbourhood</reg>, <lb/>
and was no longer entirely dependent on her <lb/>
own slender earnings. Her grandmother died in 1826, <lb/>
and she then inherited a small income of about &pound;12 a year. <lb/>
She removed into Yarmouth, and hired two rooms in a <lb/>
poor part of the town. Shortly after this she entirely <lb/>
gave up working as a dressmaker. She could not, of <lb/>
course, live on the little annuity she inherited from her <lb/>
grandmother; this was not much more than enough to <lb/>
pay for her rooms. But she did not fear for herself. Her <lb/>
personal wants were of the simplest description, and she <lb/>
said herself that she had no care: "God, who had called <lb/>
me into the vineyard, had said, 'Whatsoever is right, I <lb/>
will give you.'" It would, indeed, have been to the <lb/>
discredit of Yarmouth if such a woman had been suffered <lb/>
to be in want. Many gifts were sent to her, but she <lb/>
scrupulously devoted everything that reached her to the <lb/>
prisoners, unless the donor expressly stated that it was not <lb/>
for her charities but for herself. About 1840, after <lb/>
twenty-one years' work in the prison and workhouse of <lb/>
the town, the Corporation of Yarmouth urged her to accept <lb/>
a small salary from the borough funds. She at first <lb/>
refused, because it was painful to her that the prisoners <lb/>
should ever regard her in any other light than as their <lb/>
disinterested friend; she feared that if she accepted the <lb/>
money of the Corporation she would be looked upon as <lb/>
merely one of the gaol functionaries, and that they would <lb/>
"rank her with the turnkeys and others who got their <lb/>
living by the duties which they discharged." It was <lb/>
urged upon her that this view was a mistaken one, and <lb/>
she was advised at least to accept a small salary as an <lb/>
experiment. She replied, "To try the experiment, which <lb/>
might injure the thing I live and breathe for, seems like <lb/>
<pb n="34" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0051"/>
applying a knife to your child's throat to know if it will <lb/>
cut. As for my circumstances, I have not a wish <reg orig="un-|gratified">ungratified</reg>, <lb/>
and am more than content." The following year, <lb/>
however, it was evident that her health was giving way, <lb/>
and another attempt was made, which ended in the <lb/>
Corporation voting her the small sum of &pound;12 a year, not as <lb/>
a salary, but as a voluntary gift to one who had been of <lb/>
such inestimable service to the town. She did not live <lb/>
long after this. Her health gradually became feebler, but <lb/>
she continued her daily work at the gaol till 17th April <lb/>
1843. After that date she never again left her rooms, and <lb/>
after a few months of intense suffering, she died on the <lb/>
15th October. When the nurse who was with her told <lb/>
her the end was near, she clasped her hands together and <lb/>
exclaimed, "Thank God, thank God." They were her <lb/>
last words. She was buried at Caister; the tombstone <lb/>
which marks her grave bears an inscription dictated by <lb/>
herself, giving simply her name and the dates of her birth <lb/>
and death, with a reference to the chapter of Corinthians <lb/>
which forms part of the Church of England Service for <lb/>
the Burial of the Dead. Well, indeed, is it near that <lb/>
grave, and full of the thoughts inspired by that life, for us <lb/>
to feel that "Death is swallowed up in victory."</p>
<p>The citizens of Yarmouth marked their gratitude and <lb/>
veneration for her by putting a stained-glass window to <lb/>
her memory in St. Nicholas's Church. Her name is <lb/>
reverently cherished in her native town. Dr. Stanley, who <lb/>
was Bishop of Norwich at the time of her death, gave <lb/>
expression to the general feeling when he said, "I would <lb/>
canonise Sarah Martin if I could!"</p>

MARY SOMERVILLE</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Mary Somerville</hi>, the most remarkable scientific woman <lb/>
our country has produced, was born at Jedburgh in 1780. <lb/>
Her father was a naval officer, and in December 1780 had <lb/>
just parted from his wife to go on foreign service for some <lb/>
years. She had accompanied her husband to London, and <lb/>
on returning home to Scotland was obliged to stay at the <lb/>
Manse of Jedburgh, the home of her brother-in-law and <lb/>
sister, Dr. and Mrs. Somerville. Here little Mary was born, <lb/>
in the house of her uncle and aunt, who afterwards became <lb/>
her father and mother-in-law, for her second husband was <lb/>
their son. In the interesting reminiscences she has left <lb/>
of her life, she records the curious fact that she was born <lb/>
in the home of her future husband, and was nursed by <lb/>
his mother.</p>
<p>Mary was of good birth on both sides. Her father was <lb/>
Admiral Sir William Fairfax, of the well-known Yorkshire <lb/>
family of that name, which had furnished a General to the <lb/>
Parliamentary army in the civil wars of the reign of <lb/>
Charles I. This family was connected with that of the <lb/>
famous American patriot, George Washington. During <lb/>
the American War of Independence, Mary Somerville's <lb/>
father, then Lieutenant Fairfax, was on board his ship on <lb/>
an American station, when he received a letter from <lb/>
General Washington, claiming cousinship with him, and <lb/>
<pb n="36" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0053"/>
inviting the young man to pay him a visit. The invitation <lb/>
was not accepted, but Lieutenant Fairfax's daughter lived <lb/>
to regret that the letter which conveyed it had not been <lb/>
preserved. Admiral Fairfax was concerned with Admiral <lb/>
Duncan in the famous victory of Camperdown, and gave <lb/>
many proofs that he was in every way a gallant sailor and <lb/>
a brave man. Mary Somerville's mother was of an ancient <lb/>
Scottish family named Charters. The pride of descent <lb/>
was very strongly marked among her Scotch relatives. <lb/>
Lady Fairfax does not seem much to have sympathised <lb/>
with her remarkable child. Mary, however, inherited some <lb/>
excellent qualities from both parents. Lady Fairfax was, <lb/>
in some ways, as courageous as her husband; <reg orig="notwithstand-|ing">notwithstanding</reg> <lb/>
a full allowance of Scotch superstitions and a special <lb/>
terror of storms and darkness, she had what her daughter <lb/>
called "presence of mind and the courage of necessity." <lb/>
On one occasion the house she was living in was in the <lb/>
greatest danger of being burned down. The flames of a <lb/>
neighbouring fire had spread till they reached the next <lb/>
house but one to that which she occupied. Casks of <lb/>
turpentine and oil in a neighbouring carriage manufactory <lb/>
were exploding with the heat. Lady Fairfax made all the <lb/>
needful preparations for saving her furniture, and had her <lb/>
family plate and papers securely packed. She assembled <lb/>
in the house a sufficient number of men to move the <lb/>
furniture out, if needs were. Then she quietly remarked, <lb/>
"Now let us breakfast; it is time enough for us to move <lb/>
our things when the next house takes fire." The next <lb/>
house, after all, did not take fire, and, while her neighbours <lb/>
lost half their property by throwing it recklessly into the <lb/>
street, before the actual necessity for doing so had arisen, <lb/>
Lady Fairfax suffered no loss at all. The same kind of cool <lb/>
courage was often exhibited by Mary Somerville in later life. <lb/>
On one occasion she stayed with her family at Florence <reg orig="dur-|ing">during</reg> <lb/>
a severe outbreak of cholera there, when almost every <lb/>
one who could do so had fled panic-stricken from the city.</p>
<p>During the long absences of Sir William Fairfax on <lb/>
foreign service, Lady Fairfax and her children led a very <lb/>
<pb n="37" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0054"/>
quiet life at the little seaside village of Burntisland, just <lb/>
opposite to Edinburgh, on the Firth of Forth. As a young <lb/>
child, Mary led a wild, outdoor life, with hardly any <lb/>
education, in the ordinary sense of the word, though there <lb/>
is no doubt that in collecting shells, fossils, and seaweeds, <lb/>
in watching and studying the habits and appearance of <lb/>
wild birds, and in gazing at the stars through her little <lb/>
bedroom window, the whole life of this wonderful child <lb/>
was really an education of the great powers of her mind. <lb/>
However, when her father returned from sea about 1789 <lb/>
he was shocked to find Mary "such a little savage"; and <lb/>
it was resolved that she must be sent to a boarding school. <lb/>
She remained there a year and learned nothing at all. <lb/>
Her lithesome, active, well-formed body was enclosed in <lb/>
stiff stays, with a steel busk in front; a metal rod, with a <lb/>
semicircle which went under the chin, was clasped to this <lb/>
busk, and in this instrument of torture she was set to learn <lb/>
columns of Johnson's dictionary by heart. This was the <lb/>
process which at that time went by the name of education <lb/>
in girls' schools. Fortunately she was not kept long at <lb/>
school. Mary had learned nothing, and her mother was <lb/>
angry that she had spent so much money in vain. She <lb/>
would have been content, she said, if Mary had only learnt <lb/>
to write well and keep accounts, which was all that a woman <lb/>
was expected to know. After this Mary soon commenced the <lb/>
process of self-education which only ended with her long <lb/>
life of ninety-two years. She not only learnt all she could <lb/>
about birds, beasts, fishes, plants, eggs and seaweeds, but <lb/>
she also found a Shakespeare which she read at every <lb/>
moment when she could do so undisturbed. A little later <lb/>
her mother moved into Edinburgh for the winter, and Mary <lb/>
had music lessons, and by degrees taught herself Latin. <lb/>
The studious bent of her mind had now thoroughly declared <lb/>
itself; but till she was about fourteen she had never <reg orig="re-|ceived">received</reg> <lb/>
a word of encouragement about her studies. At <lb/>
that age she had the good fortune to pay a visit to her <lb/>
uncle and aunt at Jedburgh, in whose house she had been <lb/>
born. Her uncle, Dr. Somerville, was the first person who <lb/>
<pb n="38" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0055"/>
ever encouraged and helped her in her studies. She <reg orig="ven-|tured">ventured</reg> <lb/>
to confide in him that she had been trying to learn <lb/>
Latin by herself, but feared it was no use. He reassured <lb/>
her by telling her of the women in ancient times who had <lb/>
been classical scholars. He moreover read Virgil with her <lb/>
for two hours every morning in his study. A few years <lb/>
later than this she taught herself Greek enough to read <lb/>
Xenophon and Herodotus, and in time she became <reg orig="suffi-|ciently">sufficiently</reg> <lb/>
proficient in the language to thoroughly appreciate <lb/>
its greatest literature.</p>
<p>One of the most striking things about her was the <reg orig="many-|sided">manysided</reg> <lb/>
character of her mind. Some people&mdash;men as well <lb/>
as women&mdash;who are scientific or mathematical seem to care <lb/>
for nothing but science or mathematics; but it may be <lb/>
truly said of her that "Everything was grist that came to <lb/>
her mill." There was hardly any branch of art or <lb/>
knowledge which she did not delight in. She studied <lb/>
painting under Mr. Nasmyth in Edinburgh, and he declared <lb/>
her to be the best pupil he had ever had. Almost to the <lb/>
day of her death she delighted in painting and drawing. <lb/>
She was also an excellent musician and botanist. The <lb/>
special study with which her name will always be associated <lb/>
was mathematics as applied to the study of the heavens, <lb/>
but she also wrote on physical geography and on microscopic <lb/>
science. It is sometimes thought that if women are learned <lb/>
they are nearly sure to neglect their domestic duties, or <lb/>
that, in the witty words of Sydney Smith, "if women are <lb/>
permitted to eat of the tree of knowledge, the rest of the <lb/>
family will soon be reduced to the same aerial and <reg orig="unsatis-|factory">unsatisfactory</reg> <lb/>
diet." Mrs. Somerville was a living proof of the <lb/>
folly of this opinion. She was an excellent housewife and <lb/>
a particularly skilful needlewoman. She astonished those <lb/>
who thought a scientific woman could not understand <reg orig="any-|thing">anything</reg> <lb/>
of cookery, by her notable preparation of black currant <lb/>
jelly for her husband's throat on their wedding journey. <lb/>
On one occasion she supplied with marmalade, made by her <lb/>
own hands, one of the ships that were being fitted out for <lb/>
a Polar expedition. She was a most loving wife and tender <lb/>
<pb n="39" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0056"/>
mother as well as a devoted and faithful friend. She gave <lb/>
up far more time than most mothers do to the education <lb/>
of her children. Her love of animals, especially of birds, <lb/>
was very strongly developed. With all her devotion to <lb/>
science she was horrified at the barbarities of vivisection, <lb/>
and cordially supported those who have successfully exerted <lb/>
themselves to prevent it from spreading in England to the <lb/>
same hideous proportions which it has reached on the <reg orig="con-|tinent">continent</reg> <lb/>
of Europe. Many pages of one of her learned works <lb/>
were written with a little tame mountain sparrow sitting <lb/>
on her shoulder. On one occasion, having been introduced <lb/>
to the Hon. Mountstuart Elphinstone, she says he quite <lb/>
won her heart by exclaiming, in reference to the number <lb/>
of little birds that were eaten in Italy, "What! robins! <lb/>
Eat a robin! I would as soon eat a child."</p>
<p>Her first husband, Mr. Samuel Greig, only lived three <lb/>
years after their marriage in 1804. He appears to have <lb/>
been one of those men of inferior capacity, who dislike and <lb/>
dread intellectual power in women. He had a very low <lb/>
opinion of the intelligence of women, and had himself no <lb/>
interest in, nor knowledge of, any kind of science. When <lb/>
his wife was left a widow with two sons at the early age <lb/>
of twenty-seven, she returned to her father's house in <lb/>
Scotland, and worked steadily at mathematics. She <reg orig="pro-|fited">profited</reg> <lb/>
by the instructions of Professor Wallace, of the <lb/>
University of Edinburgh, and gained a silver medal from <lb/>
one of the mathematical societies of that day. Nearly all <lb/>
the members of her family were still loud in their <reg orig="con-|demnation">condemnation</reg> <lb/>
of what they chose to regard as her eccentric <lb/>
and foolish behaviour in devoting herself to science instead <lb/>
of society. There were, however, exceptions. Her Uncle <lb/>
and Aunt Somerville and their son William did not join in the <lb/>
chorus of disapprobation which her studies provoked. With <lb/>
them she found a real home of loving sympathy and <lb/>
encouragement. In 1812 she and her cousin William <lb/>
were married. His delight and pride in her during their <lb/>
long married life of nearly fifty years were unbounded. <lb/>
For the first time in her life she now had the daily <lb/>
<pb n="40" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0057"/>
companionship of a thoroughly sympathetic spirit. Much <lb/>
of what the world owes to her it owes indirectly to him, <lb/>
because he stimulated her powers, and delighted in anything <lb/>
that brought them out. He was in the medical department <lb/>
of the army, and scientific pursuits were thoroughly <reg orig="con-|genial">congenial</reg> <lb/>
to him. He had a fine and well cultivated mind which <lb/>
he delighted in using to further his wife's pursuits. He <lb/>
searched libraries for the books she required, "copying and <lb/>
recopying her manuscripts to save her time." In the words <lb/>
of one of their daughters, "No trouble seemed too great <lb/>
which he bestowed upon her; it was a labour of love." <lb/>
When Mrs. Somerville became famous through her scientific <lb/>
writings, the other members of her family, who had formerly <lb/>
ridiculed and blamed her, became loud in her praise. <lb/>
She knew how to value such commendation in comparison <lb/>
with that which she had constantly received from her <lb/>
husband. She wrote about this, "The warmth with which <lb/>
my husband entered into my success deeply affected me; <lb/>
for not one in ten thousand would have rejoiced at it as he <lb/>
did; but he was of a generous nature, far above jealousy, <lb/>
and he continued through life to take the kindest interest in <lb/>
all I did." Mrs. Somerville's first work, <hi rend="italic">The Mechanism <lb/>
of the Heavens,</hi> would probably never have been written <lb/>
but at the instance of Lord Brougham, whose efforts were <lb/>
warmly supported by those of Mr. Somerville. In March <lb/>
1827 Lord Brougham, on behalf of the Society for the <lb/>
Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, wrote a letter begging <lb/>
Mrs. Somerville to write an account of Newton's <hi rend="italic">Principia</hi> <lb/>
and of La Place's <hi rend="italic">M&eacute;canique C&eacute;leste</hi>. In reference to <lb/>
the latter book he wrote, "In England there are now not <lb/>
twenty people who know this great work, except by name, <lb/>
and not a hundred who know it even by name. My firm <lb/>
belief is that Mrs. Somerville could add two cyphers to each <lb/>
of these figures." Mrs. Somerville was overwhelmed with <lb/>
astonishment at this request. She was most modest and <lb/>
diffident of her own powers, and honestly believed that <lb/>
her self-acquired knowledge was so greatly inferior to that <lb/>
of the men who had been educated at the universities, that <lb/>
<pb n="41" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0058"/>
it would be the height of presumption for her to attempt <lb/>
to write on the subject. The persuasions of Lord Brougham <lb/>
and of her husband at last prevailed so far that she promised <lb/>
to make the attempt; on the express condition, however, <lb/>
that her manuscript should be put into the fire unless it <lb/>
fulfilled the expectations of those who urged its production. <lb/>
"Thus suddenly," she writes, "the whole character and <lb/>
course of my future life was changed." One is tempted to <lb/>
believe that this first plunge into authorship was, to some <lb/>
extent, stimulated by a loss of nearly all their fortune <lb/>
which had a short time before befallen Mr. and Mrs. <lb/>
Somerville. Before authorship has become a habit, the <lb/>
whip of poverty is often needed to rouse a student to the <lb/>
exertion and labour it requires. The impediments to <lb/>
authorship in Mrs. Somerville's case were more than <lb/>
usually formidable. In the memoirs she has left of this <lb/>
part of her life, she speaks of the difficulty which she <reg orig="ex-|perienced">experienced</reg> <lb/>
as the mother of a family and the head of a <lb/>
household in keeping any time free for her work. It <lb/>
was only after she had attended to social and family duties <lb/>
that she had time for writing, and even then she was <lb/>
subjected to many interruptions. The Somervilles were <lb/>
then living at Chelsea, and she felt at that distance from <lb/>
town, it would be ungracious to decline to receive those <lb/>
who had come out to call upon her. But she groans at the <lb/>
remembrance of the annoyance she sometimes felt when <lb/>
she was engaged in solving a difficult problem, by the <lb/>
entry of a well-meaning friend, who would calmly announce, <lb/>
"I have come to spend an hour or two with you." Her <lb/>
work, to which she gave the name of <hi rend="italic">The Mechanism of <lb/>
the Heavens,</hi> progressed, however, in spite of interruptions, <lb/>
to such good purpose that in less than a year it was <lb/>
complete, and it immediately placed its author in the first <lb/>
rank among the scientific thinkers and writers of the day. <lb/>
She was elected an honorary member of the Astronomical <lb/>
Society, at the same time with Caroline Herschel, and <lb/>
honours and rewards of all kinds flowed in upon her. Her <lb/>
bust, by Chantrey, was placed in the great hall of the Royal <lb/>
<pb n="42" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0059"/>
Society, and she was elected an honorary member of the <lb/>
Royal Academy of Dublin, and of many other scientific <lb/>
societies. It was a little later than this, in 1835, that Sir <lb/>
Robert Peel, on behalf of the Government, conferred a <lb/>
civil list pension of &pound;200 a year upon Mrs. Somerville; <lb/>
the announcement of this came almost simultaneously with <lb/>
the news of the loss of the remainder of her own and her <lb/>
husband's private fortune, through the treachery of those <lb/>
who had been entrusted with it. The public recognition <lb/>
of her services to science came therefore at a very <reg orig="appro-|priate">appropriate</reg> <lb/>
time; the pension was a few years later increased to <lb/>
&pound;300 a year by Lord John Russell.</p>
<p>Throughout her life Mrs. Somerville was a staunch <reg orig="ad-|vocate">advocate</reg> <lb/>
of all that tended to raise up and improve the lot <lb/>
of women. When quite a young girl she was stimulated <lb/>
to work hard by the feeling that it was in her power thus <lb/>
to serve the cause of her fellow-women. Writing of the <lb/>
period when she was only sixteen years old, she says: "I <lb/>
must say the idea of making money had never entered my <lb/>
head in any of my pursuits, but I was intensely ambitious <lb/>
to excel in something, for I felt in my own breast that <lb/>
women were capable of taking a higher place in creation <lb/>
than that assigned to them in my early days, which was <lb/>
very low." It is interesting to observe that her enthusiasm <lb/>
for what are sometimes called "women's rights" was as <lb/>
warm at the end of her life as it had been at its dawn. <lb/>
When she was eighty-nine, she was as keen as she had been <lb/>
at sixteen for all that lifts up the lot of women. She was <lb/>
a firm supporter of Mr. John Stuart Mill in the effort he <lb/>
made to extend to women the benefit and protection of <lb/>
Parliamentary representation. She recognised that many <lb/>
of the English laws are unjust to women, and clearly saw <lb/>
that there can be no security for their being made just and <lb/>
equal until the law-makers are chosen partly by women <lb/>
and partly by men. The first name to the petition in <lb/>
favour of women's suffrage which was presented to <lb/>
Parliament by Mr. J. S. Mill in 1868 was that of Mary <lb/>
Somerville. She also joined in the first petition to the <lb/>
<pb n="43" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0060"/>
Senate of the London University, praying that degrees <lb/>
might be granted to women. At the time this petition <lb/>
was unsuccessful, but its prayer was granted within a very <lb/>
few years. One cannot but regret that Mrs. Somerville did <lb/>
not live to see this fulfilment of her wishes. She showed <lb/>
her sympathy with the movement for the higher education <lb/>
of women, by bequeathing her mathematical and scientific <lb/>
library to Girton College. It is one of the possessions of <lb/>
which the College is most justly proud. The books are <lb/>
enclosed in a very beautifully designed case, which also <lb/>
forms a sort of framework for a cast of Chantrey's bust <lb/>
of Mrs. Somerville. The fine and delicate lines of her <lb/>
beautiful face offer to the students of the College a worthy <lb/>
ideal of completely developed womanhood, in which intellect <lb/>
and emotion balance one another and make a perfect <lb/>
whole.</p>
<p>Mrs. Somerville's other works, written after <hi rend="italic">The <lb/>
Mechanism of the Heavens,</hi> were <hi rend="italic">The Connection of the <lb/>
Physical Sciences, Physical Geography,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Molecular and <lb/>
Microscopic Science</hi>. The last book was commenced <lb/>
after she had completed her eightieth year. Her mental <lb/>
powers remained unimpaired to a remarkably late period, <lb/>
and she also had extraordinary physical vigour to the end <lb/>
of her life. She affords a striking instance of the fallacy <lb/>
of supposing that intellectual labour undermines the physical <lb/>
strength of women. Her last occupations, continued till <lb/>
the actual day of her death, were the revision and <reg orig="com-|pletion">completion</reg> <lb/>
of a treatise on <hi rend="italic">The Theory of Differences,</hi> and <lb/>
the study of a book on <hi rend="italic">Quaternions</hi>. Her only physical <lb/>
infirmity in extreme old age was deafness. She was able <lb/>
to go out and enjoy life up to the time of her death, <lb/>
which took place in 1872, at the great age of ninety-two <lb/>
years.</p>
<p>She was a woman of deep and strong religious feeling. <lb/>
Her beautiful character shines through every word and <lb/>
action of her life. Her deep humility was very striking, <lb/>
as was also her tenderness for, and her sympathy with, the <lb/>
sufferings of all who were wretched and oppressed. One <lb/>
<pb n="44" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0061"/>
of the last entries in her journal refers again to her love of <lb/>
animals, and she says, "Among the numerous plans for <lb/>
the education of the young, let us hope that mercy may be <lb/>
taught as a part of religion." The reflections in these last <lb/>
pages of her diary give such a lovely picture of serene, <lb/>
noble, and dignified old age that they may well be quoted <lb/>
here. They show the warm heart of the generous woman, <lb/>
as well as the trained intellect of a reverent student of the <lb/>
laws of nature. "Though far advanced in years, I take as <lb/>
lively an interest as ever in passing events. I regret that <lb/>
I shall not live to know the result of the expedition to <reg orig="de-|termine">determine</reg> <lb/>
the currents of the ocean, the distance of the earth <lb/>
from the sun determined by the transits of Venus, and the <lb/>
source of the most renowned of rivers, the discovery of <lb/>
which will immortalise the name of Dr. Livingstone. But <lb/>
I regret most of all that I shall not see the suppression of <lb/>
the most atrocious system of slavery that ever disgraced <lb/>
humanity&mdash;that made known to the world by Dr. <lb/>
Livingstone and by Mr. Stanley, and which Sir Bartle <lb/>
Frere has gone to suppress, by order of the British <reg orig="Govern-|ment">Government</reg>." <lb/>
A later entry still, and the last, gives another <lb/>
view of her happy, faithful spirit. The Admiral's daughter <lb/>
speaks in it: "The Blue Peter has been long flying at my <lb/>
foremast, and now that I am in my ninety-second year I <lb/>
must soon expect the signal for sailing. It is a solemn <lb/>
voyage, but it does not disturb my tranquillity. Deeply <lb/>
sensible of my utter unworthiness, and profoundly grateful <lb/>
for the innumerable blessings I have received, I trust in <lb/>
the infinite mercy of my Almighty Creator." She then <lb/>
expresses her gratitude for the loving care of her daughters, <lb/>
and her journal concludes with the words, "I am perfectly <lb/>
happy." She died and was buried at Naples. Her death <lb/>
took place in her sleep, on 29th November 1872. Her <lb/>
daughter writes, "Her pure spirit passed away so gently <lb/>
that those around her scarcely perceived when she left <lb/>
them. It was the beautiful and painless close of a noble <lb/>
and happy life." Wordsworth's words about old age were <lb/>
fully realised in her case&mdash; <lb/>

<note id="n1" place="foot" n="1"><seg type="note-symbol"><hi rend="super">1</hi></seg><p>Written for the Jubilee, June 1887.</p></note>
</head>
<p>A <hi rend="small-caps">Jubilee</hi>, or a fiftieth anniversary of the reign of a king <lb/>
or queen, is a very rare event in our history. Rather <lb/>
more than a thousand years have rolled away since the <lb/>
time when Egbert was the first king of all England. And <lb/>
in all these thousand years there have only been <hi rend="italic">three</hi> <lb/>
jubilees before that now being celebrated, and these three <lb/>
have each been clouded by some national or personal <reg orig="mis-|fortune">misfortune</reg> <lb/>
casting a gloom over the rejoicings which would <lb/>
naturally have taken place on such an occasion. It is <lb/>
rather curious that each of the three kings of England <lb/>
who has reached a fiftieth year of sovereignty has been the <lb/>
third of his name to occupy the throne. Henry III., <lb/>
Edward III., and George III. are the only English sovereigns, <lb/>
before Victoria, who have reigned for as long as fifty years. <lb/>
In the case of Henry the Third, the fifty years of his reign <lb/>
are a record of bad government, rebellion, and civil war. <lb/>
Edward the Third's reign, which began so triumphantly, <lb/>
ended in disaster; the king had fallen into a kind of <lb/>
dotage; Edward the Black Prince had died before his <lb/>
father, and the kingdom was ruled by the incompetent and <lb/>
unscrupulous John of Gaunt; the last years of this reign <lb/>
were characterised by military disasters, by harsh and <lb/>
unjust methods of taxation, and by subservience to the <lb/>
<pb n="47" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0064"/>
papacy. Those who thus sowed the wind were not long in <lb/>
reaping the whirlwind; for these misfortunes were followed <lb/>
by the one hundred years' war with France, by the peasants' <lb/>
war under Wat Tyler, and by the persecution of heretics <lb/>
in England, when for the first time in our history a <lb/>
statute was passed forfeiting the lives of men and women <lb/>
for their religious opinions. Passing on to the reign of <lb/>
George III., the jubilee of 1810 must have been a sad one, <lb/>
for the poor king had twice had attacks of madness, and <lb/>
one of exceptional severity began in the very year of the <lb/>
jubilee.</p>
<p>Happily, on the present occasion the spell is broken. <lb/>
The Queen is not the third, but the first of her name, and <lb/>
although there are no doubt many causes for anxiety as <lb/>
regards the outlook in our political and social history, yet <lb/>
there are still greater causes for hopefulness and for <reg orig="confi-|dence">confidence</reg> <lb/>
that the marvellous improvement in the social, moral, <lb/>
and material condition of the people which has marked the <lb/>
reign in the past will be continued in the future.</p>
<p>It is not very easy at this distance of time to picture to <lb/>
one's self the passion of loyalty and devotion inspired by <lb/>
the young girl who became Queen of England in 1837. <lb/>
To realise what was felt for her, one must look at the <lb/>
character of the monarchs who had immediately preceded <lb/>
her. The immorality and faithlessness of George IV. are too <lb/>
well known to need emphasis. He was probably one of <lb/>
the most contemptible human beings who ever occupied a <lb/>
throne; he was eaten up by vanity, self-indulgence, and <lb/>
grossness. With no pretence to conjugal fidelity himself, <lb/>
he attempted to visit with the severest punishment the <lb/>
supposed infidelity of the unhappy woman who had been <lb/>
condemned to be his wife. Recklessly extravagant where <lb/>
his own glorification or pleasure was concerned, he could <lb/>
be penurious enough to a former boon companion who had <lb/>
fallen into want. There is hardly a feature in his character, <lb/>
either as a man or a sovereign, that could win genuine <lb/>
esteem or love. Mrs. Somerville was present at the <lb/>
gorgeous scene of his coronation, when something more <lb/>
<pb n="48" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0065"/>
than a quarter of a million of money was spent in <reg orig="decora-|tions">decorations</reg> <lb/>
and ceremonial. She describes the tremendous effect <lb/>
produced upon every one by the knocking at the door <lb/>
which announced that Queen Caroline was claiming <lb/>
admittance. She says every heart stood still; it was like <lb/>
the handwriting on the wall at Belshazzar's feast. Only <lb/>
by contrast with such a man as George IV. could William <lb/>
IV. be regarded with favour. Several prominent offices <lb/>
about the Court were occupied by the Fitz Clarences, his <lb/>
illegitimate children. His manners were described as <lb/>
"bluff" by those who wished to make the best of them; <lb/>
"brutal" would have been a more accurate word. On one <lb/>
occasion a guest at one of his dinner parties asked for <lb/>
water, and the king, with an oath, exclaimed that no water <lb/>
should be drunk at his table. On another occasion, on his <lb/>
birthday, he took the opportunity, in the presence of the <lb/>
young Princess Victoria and her mother, the Duchess of <lb/>
Kent, to make the most unmanly and ungenerous attack <lb/>
upon the latter, who was sitting by his side. Greville <lb/>
speaks of this outburst as an extraordinary and outrageous <lb/>
speech. The Princess burst into tears, and her mother <lb/>
rose and ordered her carriage for her immediate departure.</p>
<p>It is no wonder that the Duchess of Kent was anxious, <lb/>
as far as possible, to keep her daughter from the influence <lb/>
of such a Court as this. Much of the Queen's <reg orig="conscientious-|ness">conscientiousness</reg> <lb/>
and punctual discharge of the political duties of her <lb/>
station may be attributed to her careful education by her <lb/>
mother and her uncle Leopold, the widower of Princess <lb/>
Charlotte, and afterwards King of the Belgians. It is not <lb/>
possible to tell from the published memorials what clouds <lb/>
overshadowed the Princess Victoria's childhood. She <lb/>
seems to have had a most loving mother, excellent health <lb/>
and abilities, and a judicious training in every way; yet <lb/>
she says herself, in reference to the choice of the name of <lb/>
Leopold for her youngest son, "It is a name which is the <lb/>
dearest to me after Albert, one which recalls the almost <lb/>
only happy days of my sad childhood."</p>
<p>It is evident, therefore, that her young life was not so <lb/>
<pb n="49" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0066"/>
happy and tranquil as it appeared to be to outsiders. <reg orig="Per-|haps">Perhaps</reg> <lb/>
her extreme and almost abnormal sense of responsibility <lb/>
was hardly compatible with the joyousness of childhood. <lb/>
There is a story that it was not till the Princess was eleven <lb/>
years old that her future destiny was revealed to her. Her <lb/>
governess then purposely put a genealogical table of the <lb/>
royal family into her history book. The child gazed <lb/>
earnestly at it, and by degrees she comprehended what it <lb/>
meant, namely, that she herself was next in succession to <lb/>
the ancient crown of England; she put her hand into her <lb/>
governess's and said, "I will be good. I understand now <lb/>
why you wanted me to learn so much, even Latin. &hellip; I <lb/>
understand all better now." And she repeated more than <lb/>
once, "I will be good." The anecdote shows an unusually <lb/>
keen sense of duty and of conscientiousness in so young a <lb/>
child, and there are other anecdotes which show the same <lb/>
characteristic. Who, therefore, can wonder at the <reg orig="un-|bounded">unbounded</reg> <lb/>
joy which filled all hearts in England when this <lb/>
young girl, pure, sweet, innocent, conscientious, and <reg orig="un-|selfish">unselfish</reg>, <lb/>
ascended the throne of George IV. and William IV. ? <lb/>
Her manners were frank, natural, simple, and dignified. <lb/>
The bright young presence of the girl Queen filled every <lb/>
one, high and low, throughout the nation with enthusiasm.</p>
<p>The American author, Mr. N. P. Willis, republican as <lb/>
he was, spoke of her in one of his letters as "quite <reg orig="un-|necessarily">unnecessarily</reg> <lb/>
pretty and interesting for the heir of such a <lb/>
crown as that of England." Daniel O'Connell, then the <lb/>
leader of the movement for the repeal of the union between <lb/>
England and Ireland, was as great an enthusiast for her as <lb/>
any one in the three kingdoms. His stentorian voice led <lb/>
the cheering of the crowd outside of St. James's Palace who <lb/>
welcomed her at the ceremony of proclamation. He said, <lb/>
when some of the gossips of the day chattered of a scheme <lb/>
to depose "the all but infant Queen" in favour of the <lb/>
hated Duke of Cumberland, "If necessary I can get 500,000 <lb/>
brave Irishmen to defend the life, the honour, and the <lb/>
person of the beloved young lady by whom England's throne <lb/>
is now filled."</p>
<pb n="50" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0067"/>
<p>The picture of the Queen's first council by Wilkie was <lb/>
shown in 1887 in the winter exhibition at the Royal <lb/>
Academy. It helps one very much to understand the sort <lb/>
of enthusiasm which she created. The sweet, girlish dignity <lb/>
and quiet simplicity with which she performed all the duties <lb/>
of her station filled every one with admiration. Surrounded <lb/>
by aged politicians, statesmen, and soldiers, she presides <lb/>
over them all with the grace and dignity associated with <lb/>
a complete absence of affectation and self-consciousness. <lb/>
Greville, the Clerk of the Council then, and for many years <lb/>
before and after, writes of this occasion: "Never was <lb/>
anything like the impression she produced, or the chorus <lb/>
of praise and admiration which is raised about her manner <lb/>
and behaviour, and certainly not without justice. It was <lb/>
something very extraordinary and far beyond what was <lb/>
looked for." Melbourne, her first Prime Minister, loved <lb/>
her as a daughter; the Duke of Wellington had a similar <lb/>
feeling for her, which she returned with unstinted confidence <lb/>
and reliance. The first request made by the girl Queen to <lb/>
her mother, immediately after the proclamation, was that <lb/>
she might be left for two hours quite alone to think over <lb/>
her position and strengthen the resolutions that were to <lb/>
guide her future life. The childish words,"I will be good," <lb/>
probably gave the forecast of the tone of the young Queen's <lb/>
reflections. She must have felt the difficulties and peculiar <lb/>
temptations of her position very keenly, for when she was <lb/>
awakened from her sleep on the night of the 20th June <lb/>
1837, to be told of William the Fourth's death, and that <lb/>
she was Queen of England, her first words to the Archbishop <lb/>
of Canterbury, who made the announcement, were, "I beg <lb/>
your Grace to pray for me."</p>
<p>The Queen was very careful from the beginning of her <lb/>
reign thoroughly to understand all the business of the State, <lb/>
and never to put her signature to any document till she <lb/>
had mastered its contents. Lord Melbourne was heard to <lb/>
declare that this sort of thing was quite new in his <reg orig="ex-|perience">experience</reg> <lb/>
as Prime Minister, and he said jokingly that he <lb/>
would rather manage ten kings than one Queen. On one <lb/>
<pb n="51" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0068"/>
occasion he brought a document to her, and urged its <lb/>
importance on the ground of expediency. She looked up <lb/>
quietly, and said, "I have been taught to judge between <lb/>
what is right and what is wrong; but 'expediency' is a <lb/>
word I neither wish to hear nor to understand." Thirty <lb/>
years later one of the best men who ever sat in the House <lb/>
of Commons, John Stuart Mill, said, "There is an <reg orig="import-|ant">important</reg> <lb/>
branch of expediency called justice." But this was <lb/>
probably not the kind of expediency that Lord Melbourne <lb/>
recommended, and the Queen condemned.</p>
<p>In the <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of Mrs. Jameson,</hi> by Mrs. Macpherson, <lb/>
there is a letter, dated December 1838, containing the <lb/>
following illustration of the way in which the Queen <lb/>
regarded the duties of her position. "Spring Rice told a <lb/>
friend of mine that he once carried her &lpar;the Queen&rpar; some <lb/>
papers to sign, and said something about managing so as <lb/>
to give Her Majesty less trouble. She looked up from <lb/>
her paper and said quietly, 'Pray never let me hear those <lb/>
words again; never mention the word "trouble." Only <lb/>
tell me how the thing is to be done, to be done rightly, <lb/>
and I will do it if I can.'" Everything that is known of <lb/>
the Queen at that time shows a similar high conception of <lb/>
duty and right. She was resolved to be no mere <reg orig="pleasure-|seeking">pleasureseeking</reg>, <lb/>
self-indulgent monarch, but one who strove <lb/>
earnestly to understand her duties, and was determined to <lb/>
throw her best strength into their fulfilment.</p>
<p>It is this conscientious fulfilment of her political duties <lb/>
which gives the Queen such a very strong claim upon the <lb/>
gratitude of all her subjects. People do not always <lb/>
understand how hard and constant her work is, nor how <lb/>
deeply she feels her responsibilities. She is sometimes <lb/>
blamed for not leading society as she did in the earlier <lb/>
years of her reign, and it is no doubt true that her good <lb/>
influence in this way is much missed. Mrs. Oliphant has <lb/>
spoken of the way in which in those early years of her <lb/>
married life she was "in the foreground of the national <lb/>
life, affecting it always for good, and setting an example <lb/>
of purity and virtue. The theatres to which she went, <lb/>
<pb n="52" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0069"/>
and which both she and her husband enjoyed, were <reg orig="puri-|fied">purified</reg> <lb/>
by her presence; evils which had been the growth of <lb/>
years disappearing before the face of the young Queen." <lb/>
That good influence at the head of society has been <lb/>
withdrawn by the Queen's withdrawal from fashionable <lb/>
life; and there is another disadvantage arising from her <lb/>
seclusion, in the degree to which it prevents her from <lb/>
feeling the force and value of many of the most important <lb/>
social movements of our time. Except in opening <lb/>
Holloway College, and in the impetus which she has given <lb/>
to providing medical women for the women of India, she <lb/>
has never, for instance, shown any special sympathy with <lb/>
any of the various branches of the movement for <reg orig="improv-|ing">improving</reg> <lb/>
and lifting up the lives of women. Still, fully <reg orig="allow-|ing">allowing</reg> <lb/>
all this, it is beyond doubt that her subjects, and <lb/>
especially her women subjects, have deep cause for <reg orig="grati-|tude">gratitude</reg> <lb/>
and affection to the Queen. She has set a high <lb/>
example of duty and faithfulness to the whole nation. <lb/>
The childish resolve, "I will be good," has never been lost <lb/>
sight of. With almost boundless opportunities for <reg orig="self-|indulgence">selfindulgence</reg>, <lb/>
and living in an atmosphere where she is <lb/>
necessarily almost entirely removed from the wholesome <lb/>
criticism of equals and friends, she has clung tenaciously <lb/>
to the ideal with which she started on her more than fifty <lb/>
years of sovereignty. Simplicity of daily life and daily hard <lb/>
work are the antidotes which she has constantly applied to <lb/>
counteract the unwholesome influences associated with <lb/>
royalty. Women have special cause for gratitude to her, <lb/>
because she has shown, as no other woman could, how <reg orig="ab-|surd">absurd</reg> <lb/>
is the statement that political duties unsex a woman, <lb/>
and make her lose womanly tenderness and sympathy. <lb/>
The passionate worship which she bestowed upon her <reg orig="hus-|band">husband</reg>, <lb/>
the deep love she constantly shows for her children <lb/>
and grandchildren, and the eager sympathy which she <reg orig="ex-|tends">extends</reg> <lb/>
to every creature on whom the load of suffering or <lb/>
sorrow has fallen, prove that being the first political officer <lb/>
of the greatest empire in the world cannot harden her heart <lb/>
or dull her sympathy. A woman's a woman "for a' that." </p>
<pb n="53" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0070"/>
<p>So much has lately been written about the supreme <lb/>
happiness of the Queen's married life, and so much has <lb/>
been revealed of her inner family circle, that no more is <lb/>
needed to make every woman realise the anguish of the <lb/>
great bereavement of her life. In earlier and happier <lb/>
years she wrote to her uncle Leopold on the occasion of <lb/>
one of the Prince Consort's short absences from her: <lb/>
"You cannot think how much this costs me, nor how <lb/>
completely forlorn I am and feel when he is away, or how <lb/>
I count the hours till he returns. All the numerous <lb/>
children are as nothing to me when he is away. It seems <lb/>
as if the whole life of the house and home were gone." <lb/>
Poor Queen, poor woman! Surely it is ungenerous, while <lb/>
she so strenuously goes on working at the duties of her <lb/>
position, to blame her because she cannot again join in <lb/>
what are supposed to be its pleasures.</p>
<p>One of the princesses lately spoke of the loneliness of <lb/>
the Queen. "You can have no idea," she is reported to <lb/>
have said, "how lonely mamma is." All who were her <lb/>
elders, and in a sense her guardians and protectors in the <lb/>
earlier part of her reign, have been removed by death. <lb/>
Her strongest affections are in the past, and with the <lb/>
dead. She is reported to have said on the death of one <lb/>
of those nearest to her: "There is no one left to call me <lb/>
Victoria now!" The etiquette which, in public at any <lb/>
rate, rules the behaviour of her children and grandchildren <lb/>
to the Queen, seems to render her isolation more painful <lb/>
than it would otherwise be. Lady Lyttelton, who was <lb/>
governess to the royal children, is stated in the <hi rend="italic">Greville</hi> <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Memoirs</hi> to have said that "the Queen was very fond of <lb/>
them, but severe in her manner, and a strict disciplinarian." <lb/>
This may have perhaps increased her present loneliness, if <lb/>
it created a sense of reserve and formality between her <lb/>
children and herself.</p>
<p>The Queen has always shown a truly royal appreciation <lb/>
of those who were great in art, science, or literature. It <lb/>
is well known that she sent her book, <hi rend="italic">Leaves from our</hi> <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Journal in the Highlands,</hi> to Charles Dickens, with the <lb/>
<pb n="54" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0071"/>
inscription, "From one of the humblest of writers to one <lb/>
of the greatest." Mrs. Somerville, in her <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences,</hi> <lb/>
speaks of the gracious reception given to herself by the Queen <lb/>
while she was still Princess Victoria, when the authoress <lb/>
presented a copy of her <hi rend="italic">Mechanism of the Heavens</hi> to the <lb/>
Duchess of Kent and her daughter. More than twenty <lb/>
years later Mrs. Somerville wrote, "I am glad to hear <lb/>
that the Queen has been so kind to my friend Faraday. <lb/>
It seems she has given him an apartment at Hampton <lb/>
Court, nicely fitted up. She went to see it herself, and <lb/>
having consulted scientific men as to the instruments <lb/>
necessary for his pursuits, she had a laboratory fitted up <lb/>
with them, and made him a present of the whole. That <lb/>
is doing things handsomely, and no one since Newton has <lb/>
deserved so much." The Queen was also very ready to <lb/>
show her warm appreciation of Carlyle and other eminent <lb/>
writers. In an interview with Carlyle, at the Deanery, <lb/>
Westminster, she quite charmed the rugged old philosopher <lb/>
by her kind and gracious manner. Many years ago, when <lb/>
the fame of Jenny Lind was at its height, she was invited <lb/>
to sing in private before the Queen at Buckingham Palace. <lb/>
Owing to some contemptible spite or jealousy, her <reg orig="accom-|panist">accompanist</reg> <lb/>
did not play what was set down in the music, and <lb/>
this of course had a very discomposing effect upon the <lb/>
singer. The Queen's quick ear immediately detected what <lb/>
was going on, and at the conclusion of the song, when <lb/>
another was about to be commenced, she stepped up to <lb/>
the piano and said, "I will accompany Miss Lind."</p>
<p>The Queen's strong personal interest in all that concerns <lb/>
the welfare of her kingdom is well known. She became <lb/>
almost ill with anxiety about the sufferings of our troops <lb/>
in the Crimea, and she wrote frequently to Lord Raglan <lb/>
on the subject. Before the end of the siege of Sebastopol, <lb/>
Lord Cardigan returned from the Crimea on a short visit <lb/>
to England, and came to see the Queen at Windsor. One <lb/>
of the royal children said to him, "You must hurry back <lb/>
to Sebastopol and take it, else it will kill mamma!" In <lb/>
the summer of 1886, during the anxious political crisis of <lb/>
<pb n="55" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0072"/>
that time, a gentleman, who had just seen the Queen, was <lb/>
asked how she looked. "Ten years younger than she did <lb/>
a fortnight ago," was the reply. The severity of the crisis <lb/>
was for the time averted, and the relief of mind it brought <lb/>
to the Queen could be plainly read in the change in her <lb/>
aspect.</p>
<p>A wise and good clergyman, who was also a witty and <lb/>
powerful writer, the Rev. Sydney Smith, preached a <lb/>
sermon in St. Paul's Cathedral on the Queen's accession, <lb/>
in which he gave utterance to the hope that she would <lb/>
promote the spread of national education, and would <lb/>
"worship God by loving peace." "The young Queen," he <lb/>
said, "at that period of life which is commonly given up <lb/>
to frivolous amusement, sees at once the great principles <lb/>
by which she should be guided, and steps at once into the <lb/>
great duties of her station." He then spoke again of peace <lb/>
and of education as the two objects towards which a <lb/>
patriot Queen ought most earnestly to strive, and <reg orig="con-|cluded">concluded</reg>: <lb/>
"And then this youthful monarch, profoundly but <lb/>
wisely religious, disdaining hypocrisy, and far above the <lb/>
childish follies of false piety, casts herself upon God, and <lb/>
seeks from the Gospel of His blessed Son a path for her <lb/>
steps and a comfort for her soul. Here is a picture which <lb/>
warms every English heart and could bring all this <lb/>
congregation upon their bended knees before Almighty <lb/>
God to pray it may be realised. What limits to the glory <lb/>
and happiness of our native land, if the Creator should in <lb/>
His mercy have placed in the heart of this Royal Woman <lb/>
the rudiments of wisdom and mercy; and if giving them <lb/>
time to expand, and to bless our children's children with <lb/>
her goodness, He should grant to her a long sojourning on <lb/>
earth, and leave her to reign over us till she is well stricken <lb/>
in years! What glory! what happiness! what joy! what <lb/>
bounty of God!"</p>
<p>The preacher's anticipations of a long reign have been <lb/>
fulfilled, and the bright hopes of that seedtime of promise <lb/>
and resolution can now be compared with the harvest of <lb/>
achievement and fulfilment. There is always a great gap <lb/>
<pb n="56" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0073"/>
between such anticipations and the accomplished fact; but <lb/>
it will be well for us all, high or low, if we are able, when <lb/>
we stand near the end of life and review the past, to feel <lb/>
that we have been equally steadfast to the high resolves of <lb/>
our youth, as the Queen has been to the words, "I will be <lb/>
good," which she uttered sixty years ago.</p>

HARRIET MARTINEAU</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Harriet Martineau</hi> is one of the most distinguished <lb/>
literary women this century has produced. She is among <lb/>
the few women who have succeeded in the craft of <reg orig="jour-|nalism">journalism</reg>, <lb/>
and one of the still smaller number who succeeded <lb/>
for a time in moulding and shaping the current politics of <lb/>
her day. There are many things in her career which make <lb/>
it a particularly instructive one. Her vivid remembrance <lb/>
of her own childhood gave her a very strong sympathy <lb/>
with the feelings and sufferings of children; all mothers, <lb/>
especially the mothers of uncommonly intellectual children, <lb/>
ought to read, in the early part of Harriet Martineau's <reg orig="auto-|biography">autobiography</reg>, <lb/>
her record of her own childhood, and its peculiar <lb/>
sufferings.</p>
<p>The Martineaus were descended from a French Huguenot <lb/>
surgeon, who left his native country in 1688, after the <lb/>
revocation of the edict of Nantes. He settled at Norwich, <lb/>
and became the progenitor of a long line of distinguished <lb/>
surgeons in that city. Harriet's father was a manufacturer; <lb/>
she was born on the 12th June 1802, the sixth of eight <lb/>
children. There is nothing in the outward circumstances <lb/>
of her youth to distinguish it from that of the substantial <lb/>
but simple comfort of any middle class family of that <lb/>
period, save that her education was above the average. <lb/>
The independence of judgment in religious matters that <lb/>
<pb n="58" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0075"/>
had made their ancestor a Huguenot, made the latter <reg orig="Marti-|neaus">Martineaus</reg> <lb/>
Unitarians; and it was to this fact that the <reg orig="excel-|lence">excellence</reg> <lb/>
of the education of the family was in part due. For <lb/>
the Rev. Isaac Perry, the head of a large and flourishing <lb/>
boys' school in Norwich, became converted to the principles <lb/>
of Unitarianism, with the consequence of losing nearly all <lb/>
his pupils. The Unitarian community felt it their duty to <lb/>
rally round him, and support him to the utmost of their <lb/>
power. Hence those who, like the Martineaus, had children <lb/>
to educate sent them, girls as well as boys, to him. Harriet <lb/>
therefore had the inestimable advantage of beginning her <lb/>
career with a mind well equipped with stores of knowledge <lb/>
that were at that time usually considered quite outside the <lb/>
range of what was necessary for a woman.</p>
<p>She speaks of herself as having, especially in her <reg orig="child-|hood">childhood</reg>, <lb/>
"a beggarly nervous system"; and her description of <lb/>
her utterly unreasonable terrors, which she bore in silence, <lb/>
because of the want of insight and sympathy around her, <lb/>
ought to be a lesson to every parent. "Sometimes," she <lb/>
says, "I was panic-struck at the head of the stairs, and <lb/>
was sure I could never get down; and I could never cross <lb/>
the yard into the garden without flying and panting, and <lb/>
fearing to look behind, because a wild beast was after me. <lb/>
The starlight sky was the worst; it was always coming <lb/>
down to stifle and crush me, and rest upon my head." <lb/>
"The extremest terror of all," she says, was occasioned by <lb/>
the dull thud of beating feather beds with a stick, a process <lb/>
in which the housewives of Norwich were wont to indulge <lb/>
on the breezy area below the Castle Hill. A magic-lantern, <lb/>
or the prismatic lights cast by glass lustres upon the wall, <lb/>
threw her into the same unaccountable terror-stricken state <lb/>
If she could have been coaxed into speaking of these panics, <lb/>
they might probably have ceased to assail her. But this <lb/>
she never dreamed of doing. There was too little <reg orig="tender-|ness">tenderness</reg> <lb/>
in her family life to overcome her natural timidity. <lb/>
Once when her terror at a magic-lantern so far overcame <lb/>
her as to find vent in a shriek of dismay, "a pretty lady, <lb/>
who sat next us, took me on her lap, and let me hide my <lb/>
<pb n="59" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0076"/>
face in her bosom, and held me fast. How intensely I <lb/>
loved her, without at all knowing who she was."</p>
<p>When Harriet Martineau was more than fifty, she wrote <lb/>
a detailed account of all she had suffered in childhood, not <lb/>
from any want of gratitude or affection to her parents, but <lb/>
because she felt that mothers ought to know what their <lb/>
children sometimes suffer, so that they might protect them <lb/>
by tender watchfulness from becoming victims of these <reg orig="im-|aginary">imaginary</reg> <lb/>
terrors. It is not, it must be remembered, stupid <lb/>
children who are most subject to these "ghostly enemies," <lb/>
but much more frequently it is the children of vivid <reg orig="im-|agination">imagination</reg> <lb/>
and bright intelligence who are most subject to <lb/>
them. A child who is frightened of the dark ought not to <lb/>
be unkindly ridiculed or forced to endure what terrifies it; <lb/>
it ought to be helped by all gentle means to overcome its <lb/>
fear, and all other unreasonable fears conjured up by its <lb/>
imagination.</p>
<p>That Harriet Martineau showed in early childhood that <lb/>
she was gifted with extraordinary mental powers cannot <lb/>
be doubted. At seven years old she "discovered" <hi rend="italic"><reg orig="Para-|dise">Paradise</reg> <lb/>
Lost</hi>. She had been left at home one Sunday <reg orig="even-|ing">evening</reg>, <lb/>
when all the rest of the family had gone to chapel, <lb/>
and she began looking at the books on the table. One of <lb/>
them was turned down open. She took it up, and <reg orig="be-|gan">began</reg> <lb/>
looking at it. It was <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi>. The first thing <lb/>
she saw was the word "Argument" at the head of a <lb/>
chapter, which she thought must mean a dispute, and <lb/>
could make nothing of; but something about Satan <reg orig="cleav-|ing">cleaving</reg> <lb/>
Chaos made her turn to the poetry, and, in her own <lb/>
words, that evening's reading fixed her mental destiny for <lb/>
the next seven years; the volume was henceforth never to <lb/>
be found, but by asking her for it. "In a few months, I <lb/>
believe there was hardly a line in <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi> that I <lb/>
could not have instantly turned to. I sent myself to <lb/>
sleep by repeating it, and when my curtains were drawn <lb/>
back in the morning, descriptions of heavenly light rushed <lb/>
into my memory." Her keen appreciation of Milton's <lb/>
great poem was the compensation nature provided for <lb/>
<pb n="60" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0077"/>
the imaginative terrors which made her childhood such <lb/>
a sad one.</p>
<p>Another misfortune was in store for her, which might <lb/>
have embittered the whole of her future existence. When <lb/>
she was about twelve years old it was recognised that her <lb/>
hearing was not good; by sixteen her deafness had become <lb/>
very noticeable, and excessively painful to herself; and <lb/>
before she was twenty she had become extremely deaf, so <lb/>
that she could hear little or nothing without the help of a <lb/>
trumpet. Few people can realise how much the loss of <lb/>
this all-important sense must have cost her. At the <reg orig="out-|set">outset</reg> <lb/>
of life, to be deprived of a faculty on which almost all <lb/>
free and pleasant social intercourse depends must be a <lb/>
bitter trial. One striking characteristic of Harriet <reg orig="Mar-|tineau's">Martineau's</reg> <lb/>
mind was brought into relief by it. Throughout <lb/>
her life a misfortune never overtook her without calling <lb/>
out the strength necessary to bear it, not only with patience, <lb/>
but with cheerfulness. As soon as it was clear that her <lb/>
deafness was a trial that would last as long as her life, she <lb/>
made a resolution with regard to it. She determined never <lb/>
to inquire what was said, but to trust to her friends to <reg orig="re-|peat">repeat</reg> <lb/>
to her what was important and worth hearing. This <lb/>
she rightly regarded as the only way of preventing her <lb/>
deafness becoming as irksome and trying to her <reg orig="compan-|ions">companions</reg> <lb/>
as it was to herself. It was not till she was nearly <lb/>
thirty that she began to use a trumpet, and she blamed <lb/>
herself seriously for the delay; for she felt it to be the <lb/>
duty of the deaf to spare other people as much fatigue as <lb/>
possible, and also to preserve their own natural capacity <lb/>
for sound, and the habit of receiving it, as long as possible.</p>
<p>Harriet's first attempt at authorship was undertaken at <lb/>
the age of nineteen; she was tenderly devoted to her <lb/>
brother James, who was two years her junior. When he <lb/>
left home for college, the brightness of her life departed; <lb/>
he told her she must not permit herself to be so miserable, <lb/>
and advised her to take refuge, each time he left her, in <lb/>
some new pursuit; her first new pursuit was writing, and <lb/>
with a beating heart she posted her manuscript to the <lb/>
<pb n="61" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0078"/>
Editor of the <hi rend="italic">Monthly Repository,</hi> a Unitarian magazine of <lb/>
that day. She adopted the signature of "V. of Norwich"; <lb/>
all authors will sympathise with what she felt when her <lb/>
manuscript was accepted, and she saw herself for the first <lb/>
time in print. She had not told any member of her family <lb/>
of her enterprise. Imagine therefore her delight when her <lb/>
eldest brother, whom she regarded with the utmost <reg orig="vener-|ation">veneration</reg>, <lb/>
selected this article by V. of Norwich for special <lb/>
commendation, reading passages from it aloud, and calling <lb/>
upon Harriet to say whether she did not think it first-rate. <lb/>
After a brief attempt to keep her secret, she blurted out, <lb/>
"I never could baffle anybody. The truth is, that paper <lb/>
is mine." The kind brother read on in silence, and as she <lb/>
was going he laid his hand on her shoulder and said gravely <lb/>
&lpar;calling her "dear" for the first time&rpar;, "Now, dear, leave <lb/>
it to other women to make shirts and darn stockings; and <lb/>
do you devote yourself to this." "I went home," she adds, <lb/>
"in a sort of dream, so that the squares of the pavement <lb/>
seemed to float before my eyes. That evening made me <lb/>
an authoress."</p>
<p>The trials of her life, however, shortly after this time <lb/>
began to thicken round her. Her beloved elder brother, <lb/>
whose advice had so greatly encouraged her, died of <reg orig="con-|sumption">consumption</reg>. <lb/>
Her father's business declined rapidly in <reg orig="pros-|perity">prosperity</reg>; <lb/>
it was a period of great commercial depression, <lb/>
and for a time absolute ruin seemed to stare the family in <lb/>
the face. The cares and the mental strain of this time <lb/>
brought the father to his grave; he died in 1826, when <lb/>
Harriet was twenty-four years of age, leaving his family in <lb/>
comparatively straitened circumstances. Shortly after this <lb/>
Harriet became engaged to be married; but this, instead <lb/>
of bringing happiness, was a source of special trial; for <lb/>
shortly after the engagement had been entered into, her <lb/>
lover became suddenly insane, and after months of severe <lb/>
illness, bodily and mental, he died. The next misfortune <lb/>
was the loss, in 1829, by the mother and daughters of <lb/>
the Martineau family, of nearly all they had in the world. <lb/>
The old manufactory, in which their money had been placed, <lb/>
<pb n="62" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0079"/>
failed. The way in which she treated this event is very <lb/>
characteristic. "I call it," she wrote, "a misfortune, <reg orig="be-|cause">because</reg> <lb/>
in common parlance it would be so treated; but I <lb/>
believe that my mother and all her other daughters would <lb/>
have joined heartily, if asked, in my conviction that it was <lb/>
one of the best things that ever happened to us. &hellip; <lb/>
We never recovered more than the merest pittance. &hellip; <lb/>
The effect upon me of this new 'calamity,' as people called <lb/>
it, was like that of a blister upon a dull, weary pain or <lb/>
series of pains. <hi rend="italic">I rather enjoyed it, even at the time;</hi> for <lb/>
there was scope for action, whereas in the long, dreary <lb/>
series of preceding trials, there was nothing possible but <lb/>
endurance. In a very short time my two sisters at home <lb/>
and I began to feel the blessings of a wholly new freedom. <lb/>
I, who had been obliged to write before breakfast, or in <lb/>
some private way, had henceforth liberty to do my own <lb/>
work in my own way; for we had lost our gentility. <lb/>
Many and many a time have we said that, but for the <lb/>
loss of that money, we might have lived on in the ordinary <lb/>
provincial method of ladies with small means, sewing and <lb/>
economising, and growing narrower every year; whereas <lb/>
by being thrown, while it was yet time, on our own <reg orig="re-|sources">resources</reg>, <lb/>
we have worked hard and usefully, won friends, <lb/>
reputation, and independence, seen the world abundantly, <lb/>
abroad and at home, and, in short, have truly lived instead <lb/>
of vegetated" &lpar;<hi rend="italic">Autobiography,</hi> pp. 141, 142&rpar;.</p>
<p>For a time, notwithstanding the kind brother's advice <lb/>
to Harriet, to leave sewing to other women and devote <lb/>
herself to literature, pressure was brought upon her to get <lb/>
her living by needlework instead of by her pen. She tried <lb/>
to follow both the advice of her friends and her own <reg orig="in-|clinations">inclinations</reg>. <lb/>
By day she pored over fine needlework, by <lb/>
night she studied and wrote till two or three o'clock in the <lb/>
morning. Instead of being crushed by the double strain, <lb/>
her spirit rose victorious over it. "It was truly <hi rend="italic">life</hi> I lived <lb/>
during those days," she wrote, "of strong, intellectual, and <lb/>
moral effort." And again: "Yet I was very happy; the <lb/>
deep-felt sense of progress and expansion was delightful; <lb/>
<pb n="63" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0080"/>
and so was the exertion of all my faculties, and, not least, <lb/>
that of will to overcome any obstructions, and force my <lb/>
way to that power of public speech of which I believed <lb/>
myself more or less worthy." Her first marked literary <lb/>
success was the winning of each of three prizes which had <lb/>
been offered by the Unitarian body for essays presenting <lb/>
the arguments in favour of Unitarianism to the notice of <lb/>
Catholics, Jews, and Mohammedans.</p>
<p>She took every precaution to prevent the discovery <lb/>
that her three essays were by the same hand; and great <lb/>
was the sensation caused by the discovery that this was <lb/>
indeed the case. The most important result to herself of <lb/>
this achievement was that it finally silenced those who <lb/>
wished her to believe that she was fit to do nothing more <lb/>
difficult in the world than bead-work and embroidery. It <lb/>
also set her up in funds to the extent of &pound;45, and she <lb/>
immediately began to plan the work which brought her <lb/>
fame&mdash;a series of tales illustrating the most important <lb/>
doctrines of political economy, such as the effect of <lb/>
machinery on wages, the relation of wages and population, <lb/>
free trade, protective duties, and so on. The difficulties <lb/>
she encountered, before she could induce any publisher to <lb/>
accept her series, were such as would have broken any <lb/>
spirit less heroic and determined than her own. "I knew <lb/>
the work wanted doing," she said, "and that I could do <lb/>
it"; and this confidence prevented her from losing heart <lb/>
when one rebuff after another fell upon her. Almost <lb/>
every publisher to whom she applied repeated the cry that <lb/>
the public would attend to nothing at that time &lpar;1831&rpar; <lb/>
but the cholera and the Reform Bill. She says she <lb/>
became as sick of the Reform Bill as poor King William <lb/>
himself. At length, after a most exhausting and, to <lb/>
any one else, heart-breaking succession of disappointments, <lb/>
her series was accepted, but on terms that made her <lb/>
success in finding a publisher very little pleasure to her. <lb/>
The first stipulation was that 500 copies of the work must <lb/>
be subscribed for before publication, and the agreement <lb/>
was to cease if a thousand copies did not sell in the first <lb/>
<pb n="64" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0081"/>
fortnight. The dismal business of obtaining subscribers <lb/>
to an unknown work by an unknown author nearly broke <lb/>
her down. But in her darkest hour, alone in London, <lb/>
without money or friends, leaning over some dirty palings, <lb/>
really to recover from an attack of giddiness, but <reg orig="pre-|tending">pretending</reg> <lb/>
to look at a cabbage bed, she said to herself, as <lb/>
she stood with closed eyes, "My book will do yet."</p>
<p>The day of publication came at last, and Harriet, who <lb/>
had now rejoined her mother in Norwich, eagerly awaited <lb/>
the result. For about ten days she heard nothing, and <lb/>
she began to prepare herself to bear the disappointment of <lb/>
failure. Then at last a letter came, desiring her to make <lb/>
any corrections necessary for a second edition, as the <lb/>
publisher had hardly any copies left. He proposed, he <lb/>
said, to print an additional 2000. A postscript altered <lb/>
the number to 3000, a second postscript suggested 4000, <lb/>
and a third 5000! Her first feeling was that all her cares <lb/>
were now over. Whatever she had to say would now <lb/>
command a hearing, and her anxiety in future would be <lb/>
limited to making a good choice what to write about. <lb/>
Her series made a remarkable sensation; she was <reg orig="over-|whelmed">overwhelmed</reg> <lb/>
with praise from all quarters. Every one who <lb/>
had a hobby wanted her to write a tale to illustrate its <lb/>
importance. Advantageous offers from publishers poured <lb/>
in upon her. Lord Brougham, who was then the leading <lb/>
spirit of the Diffusion of Knowledge Society, declared that <lb/>
the whole Society had been "driven out of the field by a <lb/>
little deaf woman at Norwich."</p>
<p>It soon became evident, from the amount of political <lb/>
and literary work which was pressed upon her, that it was <lb/>
necessary for her to live in London. She accordingly <lb/>
took a small house in Fludyer Street, Westminster, in <lb/>
1832, where she lived for seven years with her mother <lb/>
and aunt. No change could be greater than that from <lb/>
the provincial society in which she had been brought up, <lb/>
to that into which she was now welcomed. The best of <lb/>
London literary and political society was freely offered her. <lb/>
Cabinet ministers consulted her about their measures, and <lb/>
<pb n="65" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0082"/>
she enjoyed the acquaintance or friendship of all the <reg orig="fore-|most">foremost</reg> <lb/>
men and women of the day. But her head was not <lb/>
turned, and she was not spoiled. Sydney Smith said he <lb/>
had watched her anxiously for one season, and he then <lb/>
declared her unspoilable. The well-founded self-confidence <lb/>
that had made her say to herself, when almost any one else <lb/>
would have despaired, "My book will do yet," prevented <lb/>
her from being dazzled by flattery and social distinction. <lb/>
She knew perfectly well what she could do and what she <lb/>
could not do. It made her angry to hear herself spoken <lb/>
of as a woman of genius; and in correcting a series of <lb/>
errors that had been made in an account given of her <lb/>
personal history in <hi rend="italic">Men of the Time,</hi> she drily remarks, <lb/>
"Nobody has witnessed 'flashes of wit' from me. The <lb/>
giving me credit for wit shows that the writer is wholly <lb/>
unacquainted with me."</p>
<p>She was a woman of the utmost determination and <lb/>
endurance in carrying out anything she had made up her <lb/>
mind to be right. She once remarked that she had thought <lb/>
the worst that could befall her would be to die of starvation <lb/>
on a doorstep, and added gleefully, "I think I could bear <lb/>
it." Her courage was put rather unexpectedly to the test <lb/>
in 1835, when she visited the United States. As every <lb/>
one is aware, negro slavery was lawful all over the United <lb/>
States until the civil war of 1862. But every one does not <lb/>
know that the heroic little band of men and women who <lb/>
first protested against the wickedness of slavery in America <lb/>
did so at the peril of their lives. The abolitionists, as they <lb/>
were called, were the objects, even in cities like Boston, <lb/>
usually considered the centres of culture and refinement, of <lb/>
most brutal outrage and cruelty. The abolitionists could <lb/>
not then even hold a meeting but at the peril of their <lb/>
lives. Miss Martineau found herself therefore in a society <lb/>
divided into two hostile factions&mdash;one rich, strong, and <lb/>
numerous; the other poor, small, and intensely hated. <lb/>
When she arrived she was disposed to be rather prejudiced <lb/>
against the abolitionists. She condemned slavery as a <lb/>
matter of course, but she thought those who had <reg orig="under-|taken">undertaken</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="66" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0083"/>
the battle against it in America had been fanatical, <lb/>
sentimental, and misguided. This disposition of her mind <lb/>
was diligently fostered by the defenders of slavery, who <lb/>
represented the abolitionists to her as bloodthirsty ruffians <lb/>
who were trying to incite the slaves to the murder of their <lb/>
masters.</p>
<p>It was not long before her clear intellect discerned the <lb/>
true bearings of the case. She soon acknowledged that, <lb/>
however distasteful to her might be the language used by <lb/>
the abolitionists, they were completely innocent of the <lb/>
charges made against them, and were, in fact, the blameless <lb/>
apostles of a most holy cause. From the time of forming <lb/>
this judgment, her course was clear. She boldly avowed <lb/>
abolitionist principles, and took an early opportunity of <lb/>
attending an anti-slavery meeting at which, in a short <lb/>
speech, she avowed her conviction that slavery was <reg orig="incon-|sistent">inconsistent</reg> <lb/>
with the law of God, and incompatible with the <lb/>
course of His providence. It is unnecessary at this <reg orig="dis-|tance">distance</reg> <lb/>
of time to recount in detail the fury with which this <lb/>
declaration was regarded by the bulk of American society, <lb/>
and by almost the whole American press. Insult and <lb/>
contumely now met her at every turn, in quarters where <lb/>
she had before received nothing but adulation and flattery. <lb/>
But she was not of a nature to be induced by threats of <lb/>
personal violence to consent to that which her reason and <lb/>
conscience condemned. She remained then and always an <lb/>
ardent abolitionist, and when the great question of the <lb/>
existence of slavery in the United States was submitted to <lb/>
the arbitrament of war, she was one of the chief among the <lb/>
leaders of political opinion in England who kept our <lb/>
country as a nation free from the guilt and folly of <lb/>
supporting the secession of the Southern States from the <lb/>
American Union. The late Mr. W. E. Forster said at the <lb/>
time that it seemed to him as if Harriet Martineau alone <lb/>
were keeping this country straight in regard to America.</p>
<p>After her return from America she resumed for a time <lb/>
her usual life of work and social activity in London. In <lb/>
a few years, however, her health broke down, and she <lb/>
<pb n="67" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0084"/>
removed to Tynemouth, suffering, as was then thought, <lb/>
from an incurable disorder. For five years &lpar;1837&ndash;42&rpar; <lb/>
she lay on her couch a helpless, but by no means an idle, <lb/>
invalid. Some of her best books, including her delightful <lb/>
stories for children, <hi rend="italic">Feats in the Fiord, The Crofton Boys,</hi> etc., <lb/>
were written during this period. She was under the care <lb/>
of a medical brother-in-law, who resided at Newcastle, and <lb/>
some of the most leading of London physicians visited her <lb/>
professionally. But her case was considered chronic, and <lb/>
she resigned herself to the belief that her health was gone <lb/>
for ever. After five years some one persuaded her to try <lb/>
the effects of mesmerism, and some members of her family <lb/>
and many of her former friends were very angry with her <lb/>
for getting well through its means. Her remarks on the <lb/>
subject are characteristic. "For my part," she writes, "if <lb/>
any friend of mine had been lying in a suffering and <reg orig="hope-|less">hopeless</reg> <lb/>
state for nearly six years, and if she had fancied she <lb/>
might get well by standing on her head instead of her <lb/>
heels, or reciting charms, or bestriding a broomstick, I <lb/>
should have helped her to try; and thus was I aided by <lb/>
some of my family and by a further sympathy in others, <lb/>
but two or three of them were induced to regard my <lb/>
experiment and recovery as an unpardonable offence, and <lb/>
by them I never was pardoned."</p>
<p>After her recovery she plunged again as heartily as ever <lb/>
into the enjoyment of travel and of work, and finally <lb/>
settled in a little home, which she built for herself, in <lb/>
the Lake country at Ambleside. Here she continued her <lb/>
literary activity, writing her <hi rend="italic">History of the Peace,</hi> her version <lb/>
of Auguste Comte's philosophy, and at one time <reg orig="contribut-|ing">contributing</reg> <lb/>
as many as six articles a week to the <hi rend="italic">Daily News</hi>. But <lb/>
she was not content with merely literary labour; she exerted <lb/>
herself most effectually to set on foot, for the benefit of her <lb/>
poorer neighbours, all kinds of means for improving their <lb/>
social, moral, and intellectual position. She showed them, <lb/>
by example, how a farm of two acres could be made to pay. <lb/>
She started a building society, a mechanics' institute, and <lb/>
evening lectures for the people. She was almost worshipped <lb/>
<pb n="68" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0085"/>
by her servants and immediate dependents, and was a <lb/>
powerful influence for good on all around her. On all <lb/>
moral questions, and all questions affecting the position of <lb/>
women, she was a tower of strength upon the right side. <lb/>
She heartily sympathised with Mrs. Butler in the work <lb/>
with which her name is identified. "I am told," she said, <lb/>
"that this is discreditable work for women, especially for <lb/>
an <hi rend="italic">old</hi> woman. But it has always been esteemed our <lb/>
special function as women to mount guard over society and <lb/>
social life&mdash;the spring of national existence&mdash;and to keep <lb/>

<p>In 1854 it was discovered that she had a heart <reg orig="com-|plaint">complaint</reg>, <lb/>
which might have been fatal at any moment, but <lb/>
her life was prolonged for more than twenty years after <lb/>
this, closing at Ambleside on 27th June 1876. The <lb/>
words of her friend, Florence Nightingale, might have <lb/>
served as her epitaph&mdash;"She served the Right, that is, <lb/>

FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Among</hi> the personal influences that have altered the <reg orig="every-|day">every-day</reg> <lb/>
life of the present century, the future historian will <lb/>
probably allot a prominent place to that of Florence <lb/>
Nightingale. Before she took up the work of her life, the <lb/>
art of sick nursing in England can hardly have been said <lb/>
to exist. Almost every one had a well-founded horror of <lb/>
the hired nurse; she was often ignorant, cruel, rapacious, <lb/>
and drunken; and when she was not quite as bad as that, <lb/>
she was prejudiced, superstitious, and impervious to new <lb/>
ideas or knowledge. The worst type of the nurse of the <lb/>
pre-Nightingale era has been portrayed by Dickens in his <lb/>
"Sairey Gamp" with her bottle of gin or rum upon the <lb/>
"chimbley piece," handy for her to put it to her lips when <lb/>
she was "so dispoged." "Sairey Gamp" is one of the blessings <lb/>
of the good old days which have now vanished for ever; <lb/>
with her disappearance has also gradually disappeared <lb/>
the repugnance with which the professional nurse was at <lb/>
one time almost universally regarded; and there is now <lb/>
hardly any one who has not had cause to be thankful for <lb/>
the quick, gentle, and skilful assistance of the trained nurse <lb/>
whose existence we owe to the example and precepts of <lb/>
Florence Nightingale.</p>
<p>Miss Nightingale has never favoured the curiosity of <lb/>
those who would wish to pry into the details of her private <lb/>
<pb n="70" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0087"/>
history. She has indeed been so retiring that there is <lb/>
some difficulty in getting accurate information about <reg orig="any-|thing">anything</reg> <lb/>
concerning her, with the exception of her public <lb/>
work. In a letter she has allowed to be published, she <lb/>
says, "Being naturally a very shy person, most of my life <lb/>
has been distasteful to me." It would be very ungrateful <lb/>
and unbecoming in those who have benefited by her <reg orig="self-|forgetful">selfforgetful</reg> <lb/>
labours to attempt in any way to thwart her <lb/>
desire for privacy as to her personal affairs. The attention <lb/>
of the readers of this sketch will therefore be directed to <lb/>
Miss Nightingale's public work, and what the world, and <lb/>
women in particular, have gained by the noble example <lb/>
she has set of how women's work should be done.</p>
<p>From time immemorial it has been universally recognised <lb/>
that the care of the sick is women's work; but somehow, <lb/>
partly from the low standard of women's education, partly <lb/>
from the false notion that all paid work was in a way <lb/>
degrading to a woman's gentility, it seemed to be imagined <lb/>
that women could do this work of caring for the sick <lb/>
without any special teaching or preparation for it; and as <lb/>
all paid work was supposed to be unladylike, no woman <lb/>
undertook it unless she was driven to it by the dire stress <lb/>
of poverty, and had therefore neither the time nor means <lb/>
to acquire the training necessary to do it well. The lesson <lb/>
of Florence Nightingale's life is that painstaking study and <lb/>
preparation are just as necessary for women's work as they <lb/>
are for men's work. No young man attempts responsible <lb/>
work as a doctor, a lawyer, an engineer, or even a gardener <lb/>
or mechanic, without spending long years in fitting himself <lb/>
for his work; but in old times women seemed to think <lb/>
they could do all their work, in governessing, nursing, or <lb/>
what not, by the light of nature, and without any special <lb/>
teaching and preparation whatever. There is still some <lb/>
temptation on the part of women to fall into this fatal <lb/>
error. A young woman, not long ago, who had studied <lb/>
medicine in India only two years, was placed at the head <lb/>
of a dispensary and hospital for native women. Who <lb/>
would have dreamt of taking a boy, after only two years' <lb/>
<pb n="71" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0088"/>
study, for a post of similar responsibility and difficulty? <lb/>
Of course failure and disappointment resulted, and it will <lb/>
probably be a long time before the native community in <lb/>
that part of India recover their confidence in lady doctors.</p>
<p>Miss Nightingale spent nearly ten years in studying <lb/>
nursing before she considered herself qualified to <reg orig="under-|take">undertake</reg> <lb/>
the sanitary direction of even a small hospital. She <lb/>
went from place to place, not confining her studies to her <lb/>
own country. She spent about a year at the hospital and <lb/>
nursing institution at Kaiserswerth on the Rhine in 1849. <lb/>
This had been founded by Pastor Fliedner, and was under <lb/>
the care of a Protestant Sisterhood who had perfected the <lb/>
art of sick nursing to a degree unknown at that time in <lb/>
any other part of Europe. From Kaiserswerth she visited <lb/>
institutions for similar purposes, in other parts of Germany, <lb/>
and in France and Italy. It is obvious she could not have <lb/>
devoted the time and money which all this preparation <lb/>
must have cost if she had not been a member of a wealthy <lb/>
family. The fact that she was so makes her example all <lb/>
the more valuable. She was the daughter and co-heiress <lb/>
of a wealthy country gentleman of Lea Hurst in Derbyshire, <lb/>
and Embly Park in Hampshire. As a young girl she had <lb/>
the choice of all that wealth, luxury, and fashion could <lb/>
offer in the way of self-indulgence and ease, and she set <lb/>
them all on one side for the sake of learning how to <lb/>
benefit suffering humanity by making sick nursing an art <lb/>
in England. In the letter already quoted Miss Nightingale <lb/>
gives, in reply to a special appeal, advice to young women <lb/>
about their work: "1. I would say also to all young <lb/>
ladies who are called to any particular vocation, qualify <lb/>
yourselves for it, as a man does for his work. Don't think <lb/>
you can undertake it otherwise. No one should attempt <lb/>
to teach the Greek language until he is master of the <lb/>
language; and this he can only become by hard study. <lb/>
2. If you are called to man's work, do not exact a woman's <lb/>
privileges&mdash;the privilege of inaccuracy, of weakness, ye <lb/>
muddleheads. Submit yourselves to the rules of business, <lb/>
as men do, by which alone you can make God's business <lb/>
<pb n="72" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0089"/>
succeed; for He has never said that He will give His <lb/>
success and His blessing to inefficiency, to sketchy and <lb/>
unfinished work."</p>
<p>Here, without intending it, Miss Nightingale drew a <lb/>
picture of her own character and methods. Years of hard <lb/>
study prepared her for her work; no inaccuracy, no <reg orig="weak-|ness">weakness</reg>, <lb/>
no muddleheadedness was to be found in what she <lb/>
undertook; everything was business-like, orderly, and <lb/>
thorough. Those who knew her in the hospital spoke of <lb/>
her as combining "the voice of velvet and the will of steel." <lb/>
She was not content with having a natural vocation for her <lb/>
work. It is said that when she was a young girl she was <lb/>
accustomed to dress the wounds of those who were hurt in <lb/>
the lead mines and quarries of her Derbyshire home, and <lb/>
that the saying was, "Our good young miss is better than <lb/>
nurse or doctor." If this is accurate, she did not err by <lb/>
burying her talent in the earth, and thinking that because <lb/>
she had a natural gift there was no need to cultivate it. <lb/>
She saw rather that <hi rend="italic">because</hi> she had a natural gift it was <lb/>
her duty to increase it and make it of the utmost benefit <lb/>
to mankind. At the end of her ten years' training, she <lb/>
came to the nursing home and hospital for governesses in <lb/>
Harley Street, an excellent institution, which at that time <lb/>
had fallen into some disorder through mismanagement. <lb/>
She stayed here from August 1853 till October 1854, <lb/>
and in those fourteen months placed the domestic, financial, <lb/>
and sanitary affairs of the little hospital on a sound footing.</p>
<p>Now, however, the work with which her name will <lb/>
always be associated, and for which she will always be <lb/>
loved and honoured, was about to commence. The Crimean <lb/>
war broke out early in 1854, and within a very few weeks <lb/>
of the commencement of actual fighting, every one at home <lb/>
was horrified and ashamed to hear of the frightful <reg orig="dis-|organisation">disorganisation</reg> <lb/>
of the supplies, and of the utter breakdown <lb/>
of the commissariat and medical arrangements. The most <lb/>
hopeless hugger-mugger reigned triumphant. The tinned <lb/>
meats sent out from England were little better than poison; <lb/>
ships arrived with stores of boots which proved all to be <lb/>
<pb n="73" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0090"/>
for the left foot. &lpar;Muddleheads do not all belong to one <lb/>
sex.&rpar; The medical arrangements for the sick and wounded <lb/>
were on a par with the rest. Mr. Justin McCarthy, in his <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">History of Our Own Times,</hi> speaks of the hospitals for the <lb/>
sick and wounded at Scutari as being in an absolutely <lb/>
chaotic condition. "In some instances," he writes, "medical <lb/>
stores were left to decay at Varna, or were found lying <lb/>
useless in the holds of vessels in Balaklava Bay, which were <lb/>
needed for the wounded at Scutari. The medical officers <lb/>
were able and zealous men; the stores were provided and <lb/>
paid for so far as our Government was concerned; but the <lb/>
stores were not brought to the medical men. These had <lb/>
their hands all but idle, their eyes and souls tortured by <lb/>
the sight of sufferings which they were unable to relieve <lb/>
for want of the commonest appliances of the hospital" <lb/>
&lpar;vol. ii. p. 316&rpar;. The result was that the most <reg orig="fright-|ful">frightful</reg> <lb/>
mortality prevailed, not so much from the inevitable <lb/>
risks of battle, but from the insanitary conditions of the <lb/>
camp, the want of proper food, clothing, and fuel, and the <lb/>
wretched hospital arrangements. Mr. Mackenzie, author <lb/>
of a <hi rend="italic">History of the Nineteenth Century,</hi> gives the <reg orig="follow-|ing">following</reg> <lb/>
facts and figures with regard to our total losses in <lb/>
the Crimea: "Out of a total loss of 20,656, only 2598 <lb/>
were slain in battle; 18,058 died in hospital." "Several <lb/>
regiments became literally extinct. One had but seven <lb/>
men left fit for duty; another had thirty. When the sick <lb/>
were put on board transports, to be conveyed to hospital, <lb/>
the mortality was shocking. In some ships one man in <lb/>
every four died in a voyage of seven days. In some of <lb/>
the hospitals recovery was the rare exception. At one <lb/>
time four-fifths of the poor fellows who underwent <reg orig="amputa-|tion">amputation</reg> <lb/>
died of hospital gangrene. During the first seven <lb/>
months of the siege the men perished by disease at a rate <lb/>
which would have extinguished the entire force in little <lb/>
more than a year and a half" &lpar;p. 171&rpar;. When these facts <lb/>
became known in England, the mingled grief, shame, and <lb/>
anger of the whole nation were unbounded. It was then <lb/>
that Mr. Sidney Herbert, who was Minister of War, <reg orig="ap-|pealed">appealed</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="74" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0091"/>
to Miss Nightingale to organise and take out with <lb/>
her a band of trained nurses. It is needless to say that <lb/>
she consented. She was armed with full authority to cut <lb/>
the swathes of red tape that had proved shrouds to so <lb/>
many of our soldiers. On the 21st of October 1854 <lb/>
Miss Nightingale, accompanied by forty-two other ladies, <lb/>
all trained nurses, set sail for the Crimea. They arrived <lb/>
at Constantinople on 4th November, the eve of Inkerman, <lb/>
which was fought on 5th November. Their first work, <lb/>
therefore, was to receive into the wards, which were <lb/>
already filled by 2300 men, the wounded from what <lb/>
proved the severest and fiercest engagement of the <reg orig="cam-|paign">campaign</reg>. <lb/>
Miss Nightingale and her band of nurses proved <lb/>
fully equal to the charge they had undertaken. She, by a <lb/>
combination of inexorable firmness with unvarying <reg orig="gentle-|ness">gentleness</reg>, <lb/>
evolved order out of chaos. After her arrival, there <lb/>
were no more complaints of the inefficiency of the hospital <lb/>
arrangements for the army. The extraordinary way in <lb/>
which she spent herself and let herself be spent will never <lb/>
be forgotten. She has been known to stand for twenty <lb/>
hours at a stretch, in order to see the wounded provided <lb/>
with every means of easing their condition. Her attention <lb/>
was directed not only to nursing the sick and wounded, <lb/>
but to removing the causes which had made the camp and <lb/>
the hospitals so deadly to their inmates. The extent of <lb/>
the work of mere nursing may be estimated by the fact <lb/>
that a few months after her arrival ten thousand sick men <lb/>
were under her care, and the rows of beds in one hospital <lb/>
alone, the Barrack Hospital at Scutari, measured two miles <lb/>
and one-third in length, with an average distance between <lb/>
each bed of two feet six inches. Miss Nightingale's <reg orig="per-|sonal">personal</reg> <lb/>
influence and authority over the men were immensely <lb/>
and deservedly strong. They knew she had left the <reg orig="com-|forts">comforts</reg> <lb/>
and refinements of a wealthy home to be of service <lb/>
to them. Her slight delicate form, her steady nerve, her <lb/>
kindly conciliating manner, and her absolute self-devotion, <lb/>
awoke a passion of chivalrous feeling on the part of the <lb/>
men she tended. Sometimes a soldier would refuse to <lb/>
<pb n="75" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0092"/>
submit to a painful but necessary operation until a few <lb/>
calm sentences of hers seemed at once to allay the storm, <lb/>
and the man would submit willingly to the ordeal he <lb/>
had to undergo. One soldier said, "Before she came here, <lb/>
there was such cursin' and swearing, and after that it <lb/>
was as holy as a church." Another said to Mr. Sidney <lb/>
Herbert, "She would speak to one and another, and nod <lb/>
and smile to many more; but she could not do it to all, <lb/>
you know&mdash;we lay there in hundreds&mdash;but we could kiss <lb/>
her shadow as it fell, and lay our heads on the pillow <lb/>
again, content." This incident, of the wounded soldier <lb/>
turning to kiss her shadow as it passed, has been woven <lb/>
into a beautiful poem by Longfellow. It is called "Santa <lb/>
Filomena." The fact that she had been born in, and had <lb/>
been named after, the city of Florence, may have suggested <lb/>
to the poet to turn her name into the language of the <lb/>
country of her birth.</p>
<p>Miss Nightingale suffered from an attack of hospital <lb/>
fever in the spring of 1855, but as soon as possible she <lb/>
returned to her laborious post, and never quitted it till the <lb/>
war was over and the last of our soldiers was on his way <lb/>
home. When she returned to England she received such <lb/>
a welcome as probably has fallen to no other woman; all <lb/>
distinctions of party and of rank were forgotten in the one <lb/>
wish to do her honour. She was presented by the Queen <lb/>
with a jewel in commemoration of her work in the Crimea, <lb/>
and a national testimonial was set on foot, to which a sum <lb/>
of &pound;50,000 was subscribed. It is unnecessary to say that <lb/>
Miss Nightingale did not accept this testimonial for her <lb/>
own personal benefit. The sum was devoted to the <reg orig="per-|manent">permanent</reg> <lb/>
endowment of schools for the training of nurses in <lb/>
St. Thomas's and King's College Hospitals.</p>
<p>Since the Crimea no European war has taken place <lb/>
without calling forth the service of trained bands of skilled <lb/>
nurses. Within ten years of Florence Nightingale's labours <lb/>
in the East, the nations of Europe agreed at the Geneva <lb/>
Convention upon certain rules and regulations, with the <lb/>
object of ameliorating the condition of the sick and wounded <lb/>
<pb n="76" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0093"/>
in war. By this convention all ambulances and military <lb/>
hospitals were neutralised, and their inmates and staff were <lb/>
henceforth to be regarded as non-combatants. The <reg orig="dis-|tinguishing">distinguishing</reg> <lb/>
red cross of the Geneva Convention is now <lb/>
universally recognised as the one civilised element in the <lb/>
savagery of war.</p>
<p>During a great part of the years that have passed <lb/>
since Miss Nightingale returned from the Crimea, she has <lb/>
suffered from extremely bad health; but few people, <lb/>
even of the most robust frame, have done better and <lb/>
more invaluable work. She has been the adviser of <reg orig="suc-|cessive">successive</reg> <lb/>
Governments on the sanitary condition of the <lb/>
army in India; her experience in the Crimea convinced <lb/>
her that the death-rate in the army, even in time of peace, <lb/>
could be reduced by nearly one-half by proper sanitary <lb/>
arrangements. She contributed valuable state papers on <lb/>
the subject to the Government of the day, and her advice <lb/>
has had important effects, not only on the condition of <lb/>
the army, but also on the sanitary reform of many of <lb/>
the towns of India, and on the extension of irrigation in <lb/>
that country. Besides this department of useful public <lb/>
work, she has written many books on the subjects she <lb/>
has made particularly her own; among them may be <lb/>
mentioned <hi rend="italic">Notes on Hospitals</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Notes on Nursing;</hi> the <lb/>
latter in particular is a book which no family ought to <lb/>
be without.</p>
<p>It will surprise no one to hear that she is very zealous <lb/>
for all that can lift up and improve the lives of women, <lb/>
and give them a higher conception of their duties and <lb/>
responsibilities. She supports the extension of <reg orig="parlia-|mentary">parliamentary</reg> <lb/>
representation to women, generally, however, <lb/>
putting in a word in what she writes on the subject, to <lb/>
remind people that representatives will never be better <lb/>
than the people they represent. Therefore the most <reg orig="im-|portant">important</reg> <lb/>
thing for men, as well as for women, is to improve <lb/>
the education and morality of the elector, and then <reg orig="Parlia-|ment">Parliament</reg> <lb/>
will improve itself. Every honest effort for the good <lb/>
of men or women has her sympathy, and a large number <lb/>
<pb n="77" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0094"/>
her generous support. May she long be spared to the <lb/>
country she has served so well, a living example of strength, <lb/>
courage, and self-forgetfulness&mdash; <lb/>

MARY LAMB</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> name of Mary Lamb can never be mentioned without <lb/>
recalling that of her brother Charles, and the devoted, <lb/>
self-sacrificing love that existed between the two. It was <lb/>
one of Harriet Martineau's sayings, that of all relations <lb/>
that between brother and sister was apt to be the least <lb/>
satisfactory. There have been some notable examples to <lb/>
the contrary, and perhaps the most notable is that given <lb/>
by Charles and Mary Lamb. When a brother and sister <lb/>
are linked together by an unusually strong bond of <reg orig="affec-|tion">affection</reg> <lb/>
and admiration, it is generally the sister who, by <lb/>
inclination and natural selection, sacrifices all individual <lb/>
and personal objects for the sake of the brother. For <lb/>
instance, she frequently remains unmarried in order to be <lb/>
able to devote herself to his pursuits and further his <lb/>
interests. There is no more devotedly unselfish love than <lb/>
that of a sister and brother when it is at its best. The <lb/>
love of a wife for a husband, or a parent for a child, has <lb/>
something in it more of the element of self. In both <lb/>
these relationships, the husband and wife and the parent <lb/>
and child are so closely and indissolubly identified with <lb/>
one another that it is comparatively easy to merge the <lb/>
love between them into self-love. But between a brother <lb/>
and sister this is not the case. The bond that unites the <lb/>
two can be set aside by either of them at will. It is <lb/>
<pb n="80" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0097"/>
partly voluntary in its character, and, as previously <lb/>
remarked, in the give and take of this affection, it is, <lb/>
speaking generally, the brother who takes and the sister <lb/>
who gives. The contrary, however, was the case with <lb/>
Charles and Mary Lamb. Between these two, it was the <lb/>
brother who laid down his life for his sister, sacrificing for <lb/>
her sake, at the outset of his own career, his prospects of <lb/>
love and marriage, the ease and comfort of his life, and <lb/>
his opportunities of devoting himself exclusively to his <lb/>
darling studies.</p>
<p>The story of these two beautiful lives is worth more <lb/>
than even their contributions to English literature, and <lb/>
makes us love Lamb and his sister quite independently of <lb/>
the <hi rend="italic">Essays of Elia,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Tales from Shakespeare</hi>. Mary <lb/>
Lamb was born in 1764, eleven years before her brother <lb/>
Charles. Her childhood, till the birth of this precious <lb/>
brother, seems to have had little brightness in it. There <lb/>
was a tendency to insanity in the Lamb family, and this <lb/>
tendency was probably intensified in Mary's case by the <lb/>
harshness and want of sympathy with which it was then <lb/>
the fashion to treat children. "Polly, what are those <lb/>
poor crazy, moythered brains of yours thinking, always?" <lb/>
was a speech of her grandmother's that made a lasting <lb/>
impression on the sensitive child. The love of her <lb/>
parents, her mother especially, seems to have been centred <lb/>
on her brother John, older than herself by two years. <lb/>
"'Dear little selfish, craving John,' he was in childhood, <lb/>
and dear big selfish John he remained in manhood" <lb/>
&lpar;Mrs. Gilchrist's <hi rend="italic">Life of Mary Lamb,</hi> p. 4&rpar;.</p>
<p>The first creature upon whom the wealth of affection in <lb/>
Mary's nature could be freely bestowed was, therefore, the <lb/>
baby brother. She spoke in after years of the curative <lb/>
influence on her mind of the almost maternal affection <lb/>
which she lavished on the boy who was, to a great extent, <lb/>
committed to her care. Henceforward she was no longer <lb/>
lonely, but had gained a companion and object in life. <lb/>
Her education consisted mainly in having been "tumbled <lb/>
early, by accident or design, into a spacious closet of good <lb/>
<pb n="81" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0098"/>
old English reading, without much selection or prohibition, <lb/>
and she browsed at will upon that fair and wholesome <lb/>
pasturage." This was the library of Mr. Salt, a bencher <lb/>
of the Inner Temple, to whom her father was clerk. In <lb/>
1782, when Charles was seven and Mary eighteen, he <lb/>
became a scholar of the Blue Coat School, where he formed <lb/>
a lifelong friendship with the poet Coleridge. The <lb/>
circumstances of the Lambs gradually narrowed. The <lb/>
father was superannuated, and his income was consequently <lb/>
reduced. The elder brother, John, held a good <reg orig="appoint-|ment">appointment</reg> <lb/>
in the South Sea House, but he was much more <lb/>
intent on enjoying himself and surrounding himself with <lb/>
luxuries than upon providing for the wants of his family. <lb/>
For eleven years, from the age of twenty-one to thirty-two, <lb/>
Mary supported herself by her needle.</p>
<p>The father's mental faculties gradually gave way more <lb/>
and more. By the time Charles was fifteen he left school, <lb/>
and the care and maintenance of his family in a short <lb/>
time devolved mainly on him. He first obtained a <reg orig="clerk-|ship">clerkship</reg> <lb/>
in the same establishment where his brother was <lb/>
employed, and two years later he received a better paid <lb/>
appointment, with a salary of &pound;70 a year, in the India <lb/>
House. Domestic troubles, however, thickened upon the <lb/>
family; the mother became a confirmed invalid, and in <lb/>
1795 Charles was seized by an attack of the madness <lb/>
hereditary in the family. This affliction must have <lb/>
weighed terribly upon Mary, who thus saw her one prop <lb/>
and solace taken from her. She was left alone, with her <lb/>
father in his second childhood, her mother an exacting and <lb/>
imperious invalid, and an old Aunt Hetty, who was for <lb/>
ever poring over devotional books, without apparently the <lb/>
capacity of sharing any of the household burdens. No <lb/>
sooner was Charles restored to reason than a new trouble <lb/>
began. John met with a serious accident, and, though <lb/>
in his days of prosperity his family saw little or nothing <lb/>
of him, he now returned home to be nursed. This seems <lb/>
to have been the last straw that broke poor Mary down. <lb/>
In September 1796 the mania, with which she had been <lb/>
<pb n="82" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0099"/>
often threatened, broke out; she seized a knife from the <lb/>
table and stabbed her mother to the heart. The poor old <lb/>
father was almost unconscious of what had taken place; <lb/>
Aunt Hetty fainted. It was Charles who seized the knife <lb/>
from his sister's grasp, but not before she had, in her <lb/>
frenzy, inflicted a slight wound on her father. The <lb/>
horror of the whole scene can be with difficulty pictured. <lb/>
Yet Charles, who had only lately been released from an <lb/>
asylum, had the power to cope with it, to maintain his <lb/>
calmness and courage, and above all to resolve that the <lb/>
terrible calamity which had overtaken them should not be <lb/>
allowed to enshroud the whole of his dear sister's life <lb/>
in the gloom of a madhouse. He wrote to his friend <lb/>
Coleridge five days after the tragedy, and his letter speaks <lb/>
nothing but tender fortitude. "God has preserved to me <lb/>
my senses," he writes. "I eat, and drink, and sleep, and <lb/>
have my judgment, I believe, very sound. My poor father <lb/>
was slightly wounded, and I am left to take care of him <lb/>
and of my aunt. &hellip; With me 'the former things are <lb/>
passed away,' and I have something more to do than to <lb/>
feel."</p>
<p>Severe self-mastery is perceived in every word of this <lb/>
letter. Lamb was evidently sensible that his own reason <lb/>
would totter if it were not controlled by a strong effort of <lb/>
will. In another letter written a week later to the same <lb/>
friend, the same spirit is shown; he had already formed <lb/>
the determination not to allow his sister to remain in a <lb/>
madhouse; he resolved to devote his life to her, and to <lb/>
give up all thought of other happiness for himself than <lb/>
what was consistent with his being her constant companion <lb/>
and guardian&mdash;"Your letter was an inestimable treasure <lb/>
to me. It will be a comfort to you, I know, to know <lb/>
that my prospects are somewhat brighter. My poor dear, <lb/>
dearest sister&mdash;the unhappy and unconscious instrument <lb/>
of the Almighty's judgments on our house&mdash;is restored to <lb/>
her senses, to a dreadful sense and recollection of what <lb/>
has past, awful to her mind, and impressive &lpar;as it must be <lb/>
to the end of life&rpar;, but tempered with religious resignation <lb/>
<pb n="83" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0100"/>
and the reasonings of a sound judgment, which in this <lb/>
early stage knows how to distinguish between a deed <lb/>
committed in a transient fit of frenzy and the terrible <lb/>
guilt of a mother's murder. I have seen her. I found <lb/>
her this morning calm and serene, far, very far, from an <lb/>
indecent, forgetful serenity; she has a most affectionate <lb/>
and tender concern for what has happened. Indeed from <lb/>
the beginning, frightful and hopeless as her disorder <lb/>
seemed, I had confidence enough in her strength of mind <lb/>
and religious principle to look forward to a time when <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">even she</hi> might recover tranquillity. God be praised, <lb/>
Coleridge, wonderful as it is to tell, I have never once <lb/>
been otherwise than collected and calm; even on the <lb/>
dreadful day, and in the midst of the terrible scene, I <lb/>
preserved a tranquillity which bystanders may have <lb/>
construed into indifference&mdash;a tranquillity not of despair. <lb/>
Is it folly or sin in me to say that it was a religious <lb/>
principle that most supported me? &hellip; I felt I had <lb/>
something else to do than to regret. On that first <lb/>
evening, my aunt was lying insensible, to all appearance <lb/>
like one dying, &mdash; my father with his poor forehead <lb/>
plastered over from a wound he had received from a <lb/>
daughter dearly loved by him, who loved him no less <lb/>
dearly,&mdash;my mother, a dead and murdered corpse in the <lb/>
next room,&mdash;yet was I wonderfully supported. I closed <lb/>
not my eyes that night, but lay without terrors and <lb/>
without despair. I have lost no sleep since. I had been <lb/>
long used not to rest in things of sense, had endeavoured <lb/>
after a comprehension of mind unsatisfied with the ignorant <lb/>
present time; and this kept me up. I had the whole <lb/>
weight of the family thrown on me, for my brother, little <lb/>
disposed &lpar;I speak not without tenderness for him&rpar; at any <lb/>
time to take care of old age and infirmities, had now, with <lb/>
his bad leg, an exemption from such duties; and I was <lb/>
now left alone." He then speaks of the kindness of <lb/>
various friends, and reckons up the resources of the family, <lb/>
resolving to spare &pound;50 or &pound;60 a year to keep Mary at a <lb/>
private asylum at Islington. "I know John will make <lb/>
<pb n="84" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0101"/>
speeches about it, but she shall not go into an hospital. <lb/>
&hellip; If my father, and old maid-servant, and I, can't <lb/>
live, and live comfortably, on &pound;130 or &pound;120 a year, we <lb/>
ought to burn by slow fires; and I almost would, that <lb/>
Mary might not go into an hospital. Let me not leave an <lb/>
unfavourable impression on your mind respecting my <lb/>
brother. Since this has happened, he has been very kind <lb/>
and brotherly, but I fear for his mind. He has taken his <lb/>
ease in the world, and is not fit to struggle with difficulties, <lb/>
nor has much accustomed himself to throw himself into <lb/>
their way; and I know his language is already, 'Charles, <lb/>
you must take care of yourself, you must not abridge <lb/>
yourself of a single pleasure you have been used to,' etc.; <lb/>
and in that style of talking." Charles goes on to explain <lb/>
that his sister would form one of the family she had been <lb/>
placed with rather than a patient. "They, as the saying <lb/>
is, take to her extraordinarily, if it is extraordinary that <lb/>
people who see my sister should love her. Of all the <lb/>
people I ever saw in the world, my poor sister was most <lb/>
thoroughly devoid of the quality of selfishness. I will <lb/>
enlarge upon her qualities, dearest soul, in a future letter <lb/>
for my own comfort, for I understand her thoroughly; and <lb/>
if I mistake not, in the most trying situation that a human <lb/>
being can be found in, she will be found &hellip; uniformly <lb/>
great and amiable. God keep her in her present mind, to <lb/>
whom be thanks and praise for all His dispensations to <lb/>
mankind."</p>
<p>The whole of the rest of Lamb's life was a fulfilment of <lb/>
the loving resolutions which had sustained him in the <lb/>
terrible hour of his mother's death. His love for the <lb/>
beautiful Alice W<gap desc="long dash" reason="missing" id="g2"/>n was relinquished as one of the <lb/>
"tender fond records" for ever blotted out by a sterner, <lb/>
more imperative claim of affection and duty. As soon as <lb/>
the old father died, Mary and Charles were reunited in <lb/>
one home, and her brother's guardianship was accepted by <lb/>
the authorities as a sufficient guarantee that any future <lb/>
return of her malady should not be accompanied by <lb/>
danger to the lives of others. He was faithful to his <reg orig="self-|imposed">self-imposed</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="85" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0102"/>
task. He himself was never again attacked by <lb/>
the cruel malady, but his sister to the end of her life was <lb/>
subject to recurring periods of insanity, which latterly <lb/>
isolated her from her friends for months in every year. <lb/>
Through their joint care and caution no fatal results again <lb/>
attended these attacks of mania. There is something <lb/>
inexpressibly touching in the fact that on their holiday <lb/>
excursions together, Mary invariably, with her own hands, <lb/>
packed a strait-waistcoat for herself. She was able to <lb/>
foretell, by premonitory symptoms, when she was likely <lb/>
to be attacked; and a friend of the Lambs has related how <lb/>
he had met them walking together, hand in hand, towards <lb/>
the asylum, both weeping bitterly.</p>
<p>Lamb's strong feeling against allowing his sister to be <lb/>
placed in an hospital for lunatics is more than justified by <lb/>
the accounts given, in the <hi rend="italic">Life of Lord Shaftesbury,</hi> of the <lb/>
frightfully barbarous treatment to which insane people <lb/>
were subjected in the early part of the present century. <lb/>
Their keepers always visited them whip in hand. They <lb/>
were sometimes spun round on rotatory chairs at a <lb/>
tremendous speed; sometimes they were chained in wells, <lb/>
in which the water was made to rise till it reached their <lb/>
chins; sometimes they were left quite alone, chained to <lb/>
their beds, from Saturday afternoon to Monday morning, <lb/>
unable to rise, and with nothing but bread and water <lb/>
within their reach. No wonder that Charles Lamb said <lb/>
he would burn by slow fires rather than let his sister be <lb/>
treated like this.</p>
<p>The strong restorative of work done and duty fulfilled <lb/>
enabled Charles, within little more than a year of the <lb/>
dreadful calamity which had darkened his life, to make <lb/>
his first appearance as an author. These first poems were <lb/>
dedicated to "the author's best friend and sister." He <lb/>
wished to fence her round, as it were, by assurances of the <lb/>
high value he set on her, and of the depth of his love. <lb/>
"I wish," he wrote to Coleridge, "to accumulate <reg orig="perpetuat-|ing">perpetuating</reg> <lb/>
tokens of my affection to poor Mary." When she <lb/>
was restored to his daily companionship, there was nothing <lb/>
<pb n="86" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0103"/>
in her outward manner or appearance to indicate what a <lb/>
terrible cloud rested on her past life. Her manners were <lb/>
tranquil and composed. De Quincey speaks of her as that <lb/>
"Madonna-like lady." There was no appearance of settled <lb/>
melancholy in consequence of the fatal deed she had been <lb/>
led to commit, but that it left a wound which was hidden <lb/>
rather than healed is indicated by the words written long <lb/>
years after the event: "My dear mother who, though you <lb/>
do not know it, is always in my poor head and heart." <lb/>
On another occasion, a child Mary loved asked her why <lb/>
she never spoke of her mother. A cry of pain was the <lb/>
only response. Her dependence on her brother was an <lb/>
ever-visible presence in both their lives. Mrs. Cowden <lb/>
Clarke relates: "He once said, with his peculiar mode of <lb/>
tenderness beneath blunt, abrupt speech, 'You must die <lb/>
first, Mary.' She nodded, with her little quiet nod and <lb/>
sweet smile, 'Yes, I must die first, Charles.'" The event <lb/>
was contrary to the wish and expectation thus expressed. <lb/>
Charles preceded Mary to the grave by thirteen years; <lb/>
but during the greater part of that time her intellect was <lb/>
so clouded as to deprive her of the power of the acute <lb/>
suffering the loss of her brother would otherwise have <lb/>
caused.</p>
<p>The literary fame of Mary Lamb rests chiefly on her <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Tales from Shakespeare,</hi> and a collection of beautiful little <lb/>
stories for children, called <hi rend="italic">Mrs. Leicester's School</hi>. The <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Tales from Shakespeare</hi> were written, as so much good work <lb/>
has been, under the stress of poverty. Six of the great <lb/>
tragedies were undertaken by Charles, and fourteen other <lb/>
plays by Mary. The scheme was to render each play into <lb/>
a prose story fit for the comprehension and capacity of <lb/>
children; and the work was done with inimitable felicity <lb/>
of diction, and critical insight into the situations and <lb/>
characters of the world of men and women who live in <lb/>
Shakespeare's dramas. There is a letter of Mary's <lb/>
describing herself and Charles at work: "Charles has <lb/>
written <hi rend="italic">Macbeth, Othello, King Lear,</hi> and has begun <hi rend="italic">Hamlet.</hi> <lb/>
You would like to see us, as we often sit writing on one <lb/>
<pb n="87" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0104"/>
table &lpar;but not on one cushion sitting, like Hermia and <lb/>
Helena in the <hi rend="italic">Midsummer Night's Dream</hi>&rpar;; or rather, like <lb/>
an old literary Darby and Joan, I taking snuff, and he <lb/>
groaning all the while and saying he can make nothing <lb/>
of it, which he always says till he has finished, and then <lb/>
he finds out that he has made something of it" &lpar;Mrs. <lb/>
Gilchrist's <hi rend="italic">Life,</hi> p. 119&rpar;. The <hi rend="italic">Tales</hi> were written for <lb/>
William Godwin, whose first wife was Mary <reg orig="Wollstone-|craft">Wollstonecraft</reg>. <lb/>
His second wife helped him a great deal with his <lb/>
publishing business. She was a vulgar-minded woman, <lb/>
and a pet aversion of the Lambs, especially of Charles, <lb/>
who said, referring to her, "I will be buried with this <lb/>
inscription over me, 'Here lies C. L., the woman-hater' <lb/>
&mdash;I mean, that hated one woman; for the rest, God <lb/>
bless 'em." The success of the <hi rend="italic">Tales</hi> could not, <reg orig="how-|ever">however</reg>, <lb/>
be marred by the unpopularity of the publisher <lb/>
and his wife. The book rapidly ran through several <lb/>
editions, and even now a year seldom passes without the <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Tales from Shakespeare</hi> being presented to the public in <lb/>
some new form.</p>
<p>A portrait of Mary Lamb has been drawn by the <lb/>
master hand of her brother. She is the Bridget of the <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Essays of Elia,</hi> as all lovers of the essays well know. The <lb/>
humour and delicate insight into character for which the <lb/>
writings of Charles Lamb are so distinguished, are also <lb/>
characteristic of Mary, though the humour in her case is <lb/>
less rollicking, and never breaks out in pure high spirits, <lb/>
as his often does. Some of the most charming of Mary's <lb/>
writings are her letters, which have been published in <lb/>
Mrs. Gilchrist's <hi rend="italic">Life,</hi> especially those to a young friend, <lb/>
named Sarah Stoddart.</p>
<p>This young lady had a most "business-like <reg orig="determina-|tion">determination</reg> <lb/>
to marry"; and as she generally had more than one <lb/>
string to her bow, as the saying is, it is no wonder that <lb/>
she sometimes needed the help of an older and wiser <lb/>
woman than herself, to get her out of the difficulties in <lb/>
which she found herself. Much of Mary's own character <lb/>
comes out in the advice she gives her friend. She speaks <lb/>
<pb n="88" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0105"/>
in one place of her power of valuing people for what they <lb/>
are, without demanding or expecting perfection. It is a <lb/>
"knack I know I have, of looking into people's real <lb/>
character, and never expecting them to act out of it&mdash; <lb/>
never expecting another to do as I would in the same <lb/>
case." How much practical wisdom there is in this, and <lb/>
what misunderstandings and heart-burnings would be <lb/>
saved if it were more common not to expect people to act <lb/>
out of their own characters! There is a funny little bit <lb/>
in another letter to the effect that women should not be <lb/>
constantly admonishing men as to the right line of thought <lb/>
and conduct. "I make it a point of conscience never to <lb/>
interfere or cross my brother in the humour he happens to <lb/>
be in. It always appears to me a vexatious kind of <lb/>
tyranny, that women have no business to exercise over <lb/>
men, which merely because, <hi rend="italic">they having a better judgment,</hi> <lb/>
they have power to do. Let <hi rend="italic">men</hi> alone, and at last we <lb/>
find they come round to the right way which <hi rend="italic">we,</hi> by a <lb/>
kind of intuition, perceive at once. But better, far better, <lb/>
that we should let them often do wrong than that they <lb/>
should have the torment of a monitor always at their elbows."</p>
<p>To begin quoting from the letters of Charles and Mary <lb/>
Lamb is such an enticing task that it would be easy to fill <lb/>
more pages than this little book contains. One more only <lb/>
shall be quoted from each. The most beautiful of Mary's <lb/>
letters is perhaps that which she wrote to Dorothy <lb/>
Wordsworth, soon after the death by drowning of <reg orig="Words-|worth's">Wordsworth's</reg> <lb/>
brother John. The beautiful poem by <reg orig="Words-|worth">Wordsworth</reg>, <lb/>
"The Happy Warrior," is supposed to have <lb/>
been written partly in reference to this brother, and <lb/>
partly in reference to Nelson, whose death took place <lb/>
the same year &lpar;1805&rpar;. "I thank you," Mary wrote, <lb/>
"my kind friend, for your most comfortable letter; till I <lb/>
saw your own handwriting I could not persuade myself <lb/>
that I should do well to write to you, though I have often <lb/>
attempted it. &hellip; I wished to tell you that you would <lb/>
one day feel the kind of peaceful state of mind and sweet <lb/>
memory of the dead which you so happily describe as now <lb/>
<pb n="89" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0106"/>
almost begun; but I felt that it was improper, and most <lb/>
grating to the feelings of the afflicted, to say to them that <lb/>
the memory of their affliction would in time become a <lb/>
constant part, not only of their dream, but of their most <lb/>
wakeful sense of happiness. That you would see every <lb/>
object with, and through, your lost brother, and that that <lb/>
would at last become a real and everlasting source of <lb/>
comfort to you, I felt and well knew from my own <lb/>
experience in sorrow; but till you yourself began to feel <lb/>
this I didn't dare tell you so."</p>
<p>How terrible that the mind and heart which could <lb/>
dictate such words as these were weighed down by the <lb/>
lifelong burden of insanity! Before Miss Wordsworth's <lb/>
reply reached her, she was again attacked, and Charles <lb/>
wrote in her place: "I have every reason to suppose that <lb/>
this illness, like all the former ones, will be but temporary; <lb/>
but I cannot always feel so. Meantime she is dead to me, <lb/>
and I miss a prop. All my strength is gone, and I am <lb/>
like a fool, bereft of her co-operation. I dare not think, <lb/>
lest I should think wrong, so used am I to look up to her <lb/>
in the least as in the biggest perplexity. To say all that <lb/>
I know of her would be more than I think anybody could <lb/>
believe, or even understand; and when I hope to have <lb/>
her well again with me, it would be sinning against her <lb/>
feelings to go about praising her, for I can conceal nothing <lb/>
that I do from her. She is older and wiser and better <lb/>
than I, and all my wretched imperfections I cover to <reg orig="my-|self">myself</reg> <lb/>
by resolutely thinking on her goodness. She would <lb/>
share life and death, heaven and hell, with me. She lives <lb/>
but for me; and I know I have been wasting and teasing <lb/>
her life for five years past incessantly, with my cursed <lb/>
drinking and ways of going on. But even in thus <reg orig="up-|braiding">upbraiding</reg> <lb/>
myself I am offending against her, for I know <lb/>
that she has clung to me for better, for worse; and if <lb/>
the balance has been against her hitherto it was a noble <lb/>
trade."</p>
<p>Great, noble spirits they both were, even in their <lb/>
weaknesses and imperfections, showing an example of <lb/>
<pb n="90" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0107"/>
devoted unselfishness, tenderness, and generosity that <lb/>
many who "tithe mint and anise and cummin" might <lb/>
envy. Mary Lamb survived to old age, dying in May <lb/>
1847, aged seventy-three. She was buried by her brother's <lb/>
side in the churchyard at Edmonton.</p>

</epigraph>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">There</hi> is something very interesting in tracing, as we are <lb/>
sometimes able to do, the connection of one piece of good <lb/>
work with another. The energy, devotion, and success of <lb/>
one worker stimulates the enthusiasm of others; this <lb/>
enthusiasm does not always show itself in carrying on or <lb/>
developing what has been already begun, but sometimes <lb/>
manifests itself in the more difficult task of breaking new <lb/>
ground; and thus one good work becomes the parent of <lb/>
another. An example of what is here referred to is to be <lb/>
found in the work of Mrs. Fry. To her initiative may be <lb/>
traced not only the kindred labours of Mary Carpenter in <lb/>
reformatory and industrial schools, and the still more <lb/>
modern efforts for the better care of neglected children by <lb/>
the boarding-out system, and by such societies as the <lb/>
Metropolitan Association for Befriending Young Servants, <lb/>
but to her also may indirectly be traced the success with <lb/>
which women have devoted themselves to the art of sick <lb/>
nursing, and from this again has spread or grown out the <lb/>
movement for extending to women a thorough medical <lb/>
education and training.</p>
<p>Mrs. Fry's connection with the art of sick nursing came <lb/>
about in this way. In the first quarter of this century a <lb/>
<pb n="92" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0109"/>
young German named Fliedner was appointed pastor to <lb/>
the little weaving village of Kaiserswerth on the Rhine. <lb/>
He endeared himself to his people by his devotion to them; <lb/>
but the time came when he was forced to leave them. <lb/>
The whole village was involved in ruin because of the <lb/>
failure of the industry on which its inhabitants depended. <lb/>
The people not only could not support their pastor, but <lb/>
were themselves reduced to the greatest straits of actual <lb/>
want. He left them in order to seek in wealthier places, <lb/>
not maintenance for himself, but help for them. After <lb/>
travelling for some time in Germany, he came to England, <lb/>
and while here, still intent on making known the wants of <lb/>
Kaiserswerth, he met with Mrs. Fry, and was deeply <lb/>
interested in all she was doing for the benefit of prisoners. <lb/>
Not long after this he returned to Kaiserswerth, bearing <lb/>
with him the gifts he had collected to relieve the pressing <lb/>
wants of his people; but his mind was now full of Mrs. <lb/>
Fry, and of what was being done in England by and for <lb/>
women. He and his wife resolved to begin similar work <lb/>
in Germany. They began with two young women just <lb/>
discharged from a neighbouring prison, whose relations <lb/>
refused to receive them or have anything further to do <lb/>
with them. Soon the number of discharged prisoners <reg orig="in-|creased">increased</reg>, <lb/>
and the pastor and his wife felt that they must have <lb/>
help; a friend therefore came to join them in their work. <lb/>
In this way and from this small beginning grew in time a <lb/>
very large institution, comprising not only an organisation <lb/>
to enable discharged prisoners to get work and regain their <lb/>
character, but a home and school for orphans, a hospital <lb/>
for the sick, and an asylum for lunatics. The whole of <lb/>
the work of this institution, which occupied several houses <lb/>
and comprised more than 300 persons, was done by <lb/>
carefully-trained women, called deaconesses.</p>
<p>Kaiserswerth was the parent of all the other deaconesses' <lb/>
institutions which now exist in almost every part of the <lb/>
world. The predominating spirit at Kaiserswerth, after <lb/>
that of religious self-devotion, to which a first place was <lb/>
given, was that the work of caring for the poor, the sick, <lb/>
<pb n="93" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0110"/>
and the afflicted can only be rightly undertaken after a <lb/>
long course of special preparation and training. It was a <lb/>
Protestant sisterhood; those who entered were first called <lb/>
novices; in time the novices became deaconesses, and the <lb/>
deaconesses were expected to bind themselves to remain <lb/>
in the institution five years. They were, however, bound <lb/>
by no vows, and could always leave if other duties seemed <lb/>
to require that they should do so. In this institution the <lb/>
art of sick nursing acquired a perfection at that time <reg orig="un-|known">unknown</reg> <lb/>
in any other part of Europe. It was here, mainly, <lb/>
that Florence Nightingale received the training which <lb/>
enabled her to save the lives of so many of our soldiers in <lb/>
the Crimea, and to introduce into England a new era in <lb/>
the history of nursing. Here too Agnes Elizabeth Jones <lb/>
was trained.</p>
<p>Miss Nightingale's often-repeated lesson on the subject <lb/>
of the necessity of long and careful training was not lost <lb/>
upon Agnes Jones. When she left Kaiserswerth, she <lb/>
knew, as Miss Nightingale said, "more than most hospital <lb/>
matrons know when they undertake matronship." But <lb/>
she was not content with this. After working for a time <lb/>
with the London Bible Women's Mission, she applied to <lb/>
the training-school for nurses at St. Thomas's Hospital for <lb/>
another year's training. She entered the hospital as a <lb/>
"Nightingale probationer." She went through, while she <lb/>
was there, the whole training of a nurse. To quote Miss <lb/>
Nightingale again, referring to this period, "Her reports <lb/>
of cases were admirable as to nursing details. She was <lb/>
our best pupil; <hi rend="italic">she went through all the work of a soldier, and <lb/>
she thereby fitted herself for being the best general we ever had.</hi>"</p>
<p>Before referring to Agnes Jones's crowning work in <reg orig="re-|organising">reorganising</reg> <lb/>
the nursing staff of the Liverpool Workhouse <lb/>
Infirmary, it will be well to recall the story of her life. <lb/>
There are few incidents in it, none at all of a sensational <lb/>
character; but perhaps this makes the lesson to be learnt <lb/>
from it all the more plain and simple.</p>
<p>She was born at Cambridge, of Irish parents, in 1832. <lb/>
Her father was a colonel in the 12th Regiment, and her <lb/>
<pb n="94" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0111"/>
descent was from the north Irish stock that has furnished <lb/>
so many great names to the roll-call of the worthies of our <lb/>
nation. She was a Protestant evangelical, of the type which <lb/>
northern Ireland produces. It is easy to label the religious <lb/>
sect to which she belonged as narrow and unattractive; <lb/>
but however this may be, as exemplified in her personally, <lb/>
her religion was too intense a reality to be unattractive. <lb/>
It permeated her whole life, from the time when as a child <lb/>
of seven her dream was to become a missionary, to the <lb/>
hour when she died of typhus taken from a patient in the <lb/>
Liverpool Infirmary to whom she had given up her own <lb/>
room and bed. Another deep and permanent influence on <lb/>
her mind and character was her love for Ireland. Over <lb/>
and over again in her letters we come across expressions <lb/>
which show how close to her heart lay her country's good. <lb/>
The training at Kaiserswerth was intended to be utilised <lb/>
for the good of Ireland. "I have no desire," she wrote, <lb/>
"to become a deaconess; that would not, I think, be the <lb/>
place I should be called upon to occupy. No, my own <lb/>
Ireland first. It was for Ireland's good that my first <lb/>
desire to be used as a blessed instrument in God's hand <lb/>
was breathed, &hellip; and in Ireland is it my heart's desire <lb/>
to labour. &hellip;"</p>
<p>In another letter she refers to the time when she "then <lb/>
and there" dedicated herself to do what she could for <lb/>
Ireland, in its workhouses, infirmaries, and hospitals. In <lb/>
another place she speaks of being retained in England for <lb/>
another year's training, and exclaims, "My last English <lb/>
sojourn, I hope, as Ireland is ever my bourn!" And again, <lb/>
"My heart is ever in Ireland, where I hope ultimately to <lb/>
work." Her heart's desire was never gratified; she laid <lb/>
down her life, at the age of thirty-five, in the Liverpool <lb/>
Workhouse, before she had had an opportunity of giving to <lb/>
her own dear land the benefit of all she had learned by the <lb/>
patient years of training at Kaiserswerth and in London. <lb/>
Ulster Protestant as she was to the backbone, and a <lb/>
member of the Church of England, she was a true patriot, <lb/>
and showed her patriotism by labouring with self-denying <lb/>
<pb n="95" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0112"/>
earnestness to fit herself to lift up to a higher level an <lb/>
important branch of the social life of her country.</p>
<p>She was very much stimulated, as so many women were, <lb/>
by the heroism of the Nightingale band of nurses who left <lb/>
England for the Crimea in 1854. She listened with <lb/>
vehement inward dissent to those who cast contempt and <lb/>
blame on them, and, in her own words, "almost worshipped" <lb/>
their brave leader.</p>
<p>She had paid a visit of a week to Kaiserswerth in 1853, <lb/>
but home duties, especially the care of a widowed sister, at <lb/>
that time and for some years prevented her from fulfilling <lb/>
her strong desire for a course of thorough training in the <lb/>
art of nursing. It was not till 1860 that she returned to <lb/>
Kaiserswerth for this purpose. Very soon after her year <lb/>
of preparation there, she received, through Miss Nightingale, <lb/>
an invitation from Mr. W. Rathbone to undertake the <lb/>
superintendence of the Liverpool Training School for <lb/>
Nurses of the Poor. She was overwhelmed by a genuine <lb/>
sense of her inadequacy to the task. She was a sincerely <lb/>
humble-minded woman, and not only craved more training <lb/>
in the mechanical difficulties of nursing, but doubted her <lb/>
own powers of organising, directing, and superintending. <lb/>
She hesitated, and while hesitating, joined Mrs. Ranyard <lb/>
in her London Biblewoman's Mission. Her work here was <lb/>
interrupted by a telegram summoning her to Rome to <lb/>
nurse a sick sister. As soon as the sister recovered, another <lb/>
invalid relative claimed her. By their bedsides she felt, to <lb/>
a certain extent, her own power, and the question often <lb/>
arose in her mind, "Could I govern and teach others?" <lb/>
As soon as these private cares were over, she visited <lb/>
nursing institutions in Switzerland, France, and Germany, <lb/>
and before she returned to England she determined to go <lb/>
for another year's training to St. Thomas's Hospital, and <lb/>
then to offer herself for the difficult post at Liverpool. "I <lb/>
determined," she writes, "at least to try. &hellip; If every <lb/>
one shrinks back because incompetent, who will ever do <lb/>
anything? 'Lord, here am I; send me.'"</p>
<p>She did not on leaving St. Thomas's immediately <lb/>
<pb n="96" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0113"/>
commence her work at Liverpool. She was for a short <lb/>
time superintendent of a small hospital in Bolsover Street, <lb/>
and later she filled a similar post at the Great Northern <lb/>
Hospital. It was not till the spring of 1865 that she took <lb/>
the place at Liverpool with which her name is chiefly <lb/>
connected.</p>
<p>The old system in pauper infirmaries was to allow the <lb/>
patients to be "nursed" by old inmates of the workhouse. <lb/>
Among those to whom the care of the sick was confided <lb/>
were "worn-out old thieves, worn-out old drunkards," and <lb/>
worse. Mr. W. Rathbone, of Liverpool, strongly urged on <lb/>
the guardians of that place to do away with this wretched <lb/>
system, and to substitute in the place of these ignorant, <lb/>
and often vicious, women a staff of trained paid nurses. <lb/>
He generously undertook to defray the whole cost of the <lb/>
new scheme for three years, by which time he believed the <lb/>
improvement effected would be so great that no one would <lb/>
for a moment dream of going back to the old plan. It was <lb/>
to the post of superintendent of the band of trained nurses <lb/>
that Agnes Jones was called in the spring of 1865.</p>
<p><unclear id="u1">It</unclear> was no light task for a young woman of thirty-three. <lb/>
<unclear id="u2">was breat der</unclear> her about 50 nurses, 150 pauper "scourers," <lb/>
<unclear id="u3">to labour</unclear> 1220 to 1350 patients. The winters of 1865.</p>
<p><unclear id="u4">In 6</unclear> will long be remembered as the terrible period <lb/>
of the cotton famine in Lancashire. The workhouse <lb/>
infirmary at Liverpool was not only full, but overflowing; <lb/>
a number of patients often arrived when every bed was <lb/>
full. Then the gentle authority of Sister Agnes, as she <lb/>
was called, had to be exercised to induce the wild, rough <lb/>
patients to make way for one another. Sometimes she <lb/>
had to persuade them to let her put the beds together and <lb/>
place three or even four in two beds. The children had <lb/>
to be packed together, some at the head and some at the <lb/>
foot of the bed. She speaks of them as "nests of children," <lb/>
and mentions that forty under twelve were sent in in one <lb/>
day. This over-filling of the workhouse was of course no <lb/>
ordinary occurrence, and was due to the exceptional distress <lb/>
in Lancashire at that time. The number of deaths that <lb/>
<pb n="97" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0114"/>
took place, for the same reason, was unusually large. <lb/>
Sister Agnes speaks in one of her letters of seven deaths <lb/>
having occurred between Sunday night and Tuesday <lb/>
morning.</p>
<p>The dreadful melancholy of the place bore upon her <lb/>
with terrible weight. There was not only the depressing <lb/>
thought that most of the inmates were there in consequence <lb/>
of their own wickedness or folly, but added to this the <lb/>
patients were isolated from friends and relatives whose <lb/>
visits do so much to cheer an ordinary hospital. There <lb/>
were patients with <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> wandering about the <lb/>
wards in their shirts; there were little children, some not <lb/>
more than seven, steeped in every kind of vice and infamy. <lb/>
"I sometimes wonder," she wrote, in a moment of despair, <lb/>
"if there is a worse place on earth than Liverpool, and I <lb/>
am sure its workhouse is burdened with a large proportion <lb/>
of its vilest."</p>
<p>Some of the best and most deeply-rooted instincts of <lb/>
human nature seemed to turn into cruelty and gall in this <lb/>
terrible place. One of the difficulties of the nurses was to <lb/>
prevent the mothers of the babies, who were still <unclear id="u5">at ther</unclear> <lb/>
breast, from fighting and stealing one another's <unclear id="u6">frintending.</unclear> <lb/>
had nothing to do but nurse their babies, and <unclear id="u7">the Ranyard</unclear> <lb/>
hardly do that. The noise, quarrelling, and dirt <unclear id="u8">pre was</unclear> <lb/>
in their neighbourhood was a constant source of <unclear id="u9">trouble</unclear> <lb/>
and anxiety. Another trouble was the mixture among the <lb/>
patients of criminal cases, necessitating the presence of <lb/>
policemen constantly on the premises. The ex-pauper <lb/>
women, too, whom Sister Agnes was endeavouring to train <lb/>
as assistant nurses, were a great anxiety. One morning, <lb/>
after they had been paid their wages, five arrived at the <lb/>
hospital tipsy; after some months of constant effort and <lb/>
constant disappointment, the attempt to train these women <lb/>
was given up. Besides the strain on nerves, temper, and <lb/>
spirit arising from all these causes, the physical work of <lb/>
Agnes Jones's post was no light matter. Her day began <lb/>
at 5.30 A.M. and ended after 11; added to this, if there <lb/>
was any case about which she was specially anxious, or any <lb/>
<pb n="100" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0115"/>
the B.A. degree of the University, and was ordained as a <lb/>
clergyman of the Church of England. He kept up no <lb/>
intercourse with his family, and showed no trace of his <lb/>
Irish blood, either in speech or character. He loved and <lb/>
married Miss Branwell, of Penzance, a lady of much <reg orig="sweet-|ness">sweetness</reg> <lb/>
and refinement. Their six children were destined, <lb/>
through the writings of two of them, to be known wherever <lb/>
the English language is spoken, all over the world. After <lb/>
holding livings in Essex and at Thornton, in Yorkshire, <lb/>
Mr. Bront&euml; was appointed to the Rectory of Haworth, <lb/>
which is now so often visited on account of its association <lb/>
with the authors of <hi rend="italic">Jane Eyre</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Wuthering Heights.</hi></p>
<p>Mrs. Bront&euml;'s six children were born in rapid succession, <lb/>
and her naturally delicate constitution was further tried <lb/>
by the constant labour and anxiety involved in providing, <lb/>
on very limited means, for the wants of the little brood. <lb/>
Mrs. Gaskell, in her <hi rend="italic">Life of Charlotte Bront&euml;,</hi> appears to <lb/>
imply that, more than is even usually the case, the weight <lb/>
of family cares and anxieties fell upon the mother rather <lb/>
than the father. "Mr. Bront&euml;," she says, "was, of course, <lb/>
much engaged in his study, and besides, he was not <lb/>
naturally fond of children, and felt their frequent <reg orig="appear-|ance">appearance</reg> <lb/>
upon the scene as a drag both on his wife's strength <lb/>
and as an interruption to the comfort of the household." <lb/>
One feels disposed to comment on this by saying that <lb/>
children ought never to be born if either of their parents <lb/>
inclines to regard them "as an interruption to the comfort <lb/>
of the household." To give life and grudge it at the same <lb/>
time is not an attractive combination of qualities. Though <lb/>
not much helped by her husband, Mrs. Bront&euml; was, <reg orig="how-|ever">however</reg>, <lb/>
not alone in her domestic cares and duties; the eldest <lb/>
of the "interruptions to the comfort of the household," <lb/>
Maria, was a child of wonderfully precocious intellect and <lb/>
heart. Her remarkable character was described in after <lb/>
years by her sister Charlotte as the Helen Burns of <hi rend="italic">Jane <lb/>
Eyre</hi>. In her, her mother found a sympathising companion <lb/>
and a helper in her domestic cares. The time was rapidly <lb/>
approaching when the mother's place in the household <lb/>
<pb n="101" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0116"/>
would be vacant, and when many of its duties and <reg orig="re-|sponsibilities">responsibilities</reg> <lb/>
would be discharged by Maria. </p>
<p>The little Bront&euml;s were from their birth unlike other <lb/>
children. The room dedicated to their use was not, even <lb/>
in their babyhood, called their nursery; it was their <lb/>
"study." Little Maria at seven years old would shut <lb/>
herself up in this study with the newspaper, and be able to <lb/>
converse with her father on all the public events of the <lb/>
day, and instruct the other children as to current politics, <lb/>
and upon the characters of the chief personages of the <lb/>
political world.</p>
<p>Mrs. Bront&euml; died in 1821. Maria was then eight; <lb/>
Elizabeth, seven; Charlotte, five; Patrick Branwell, four; <lb/>
Emily, three; and Anne, one. The little motherless <lb/>
brood were left alone for a year, when an elder sister of <lb/>
their mother came to live at the parsonage, but she does <lb/>
not seem to have had any real influence over them. She <lb/>
taught the girls to stitch and sew, and to become proficient <lb/>
in various domestic arts, but she had no sympathy or <lb/>
communion with them, and their real life was lived quite <lb/>
apart from hers. As soon almost as they could read and <lb/>
write at all, they began to compose plays and act them; <lb/>
they had no society but each other's; this, however, was <lb/>
all - sufficient for them. Their power of invention and <lb/>
imagination was very marked; to the habit of composing <lb/>
stories in their own minds they gave the name of "making <lb/>
out." As soon as the labour of writing became less <lb/>
formidable than it always is to baby fingers, the stories <lb/>
thus "made out" were written down. In fifteen months, <lb/>
when Charlotte was about twelve to thirteen years of age, <lb/>
she wrote twenty-two volumes of manuscript, in the <lb/>
minutest hand, which can hardly be deciphered except with <lb/>
the aid of a magnifying-glass. The Duke of Wellington <lb/>
filled a large place in the minds of the Bront&euml;s, and in <lb/>
their romances. Something of what the hero was to them <lb/>
when they were children, Charlotte afterwards put into <lb/>
the mouth of Shirley, the heroine of her novel of that <lb/>
name. After the manner of imaginative children, she not <lb/>
<pb n="102" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0117"/>
only worshipped her hero from afar, but identified herself <lb/>
with him or with members of his family. The authorship <lb/>
of many of her childish romances and poems is ascribed, in <lb/>
her imagination, to the Marquis of Douro, or Lord Charles <lb/>
Wellesley; and when these "goodly youths" are not <lb/>
introduced as authors they often become the chief <reg orig="person-|ages">personages</reg> <lb/>
of the story.</p>
<p>The shadow of death that casts so deep a gloom over <lb/>
the story of the Bront&euml; family, first fell on Maria and <lb/>
Elizabeth, the two elder children. The four girls&mdash;Maria, <lb/>
Elizabeth, Charlotte, and Emily&mdash;had been sent to a school, <lb/>
which was partly a charitable institution, at Cowan Bridge, <lb/>
in Westmoreland. The living at Haworth parsonage was <lb/>
the reverse of luxurious, but the food and the sanitary <lb/>
arrangements at Cowan Bridge were so bad that the health <lb/>
of the little Bront&euml;s was seriously injured by it. The food <lb/>
was repulsive from the want of cleanliness with which it <lb/>
was prepared and placed on the table. The children <lb/>
frequently refused food altogether, though sinking from the <lb/>
want of it, rather than drink the "bingy" milk, and eat <lb/>
unappetising scraps from a dirty larder, and puddings made <lb/>
with water taken from rain-tubs and impregnated with the <lb/>
smell of soot and dust. Besides the faulty domestic <lb/>
arrangements of the school, the discipline was harsh and <lb/>
tyrannical, and one teacher in particular was guilty of <lb/>
conduct towards Maria Bront&euml; that can only be called <lb/>
brutal. Low fever broke out at the school, from which <lb/>
about forty of the pupils suffered, but the Bront&euml;s did not <lb/>
take the disease. It was evident that Maria was destined <lb/>
for another fate, that of consumption. She was removed <lb/>
from the school only a few days before her death, and <lb/>
Elizabeth followed her to the grave about six weeks later, <lb/>
in June 1825. Even after this Mr. Bront&euml;'s eyes were not <lb/>
opened to the danger his children were in by their <reg orig="treat-|ment">treatment</reg> <lb/>
at Cowan Bridge, and Charlotte and Emily were still <lb/>
allowed to remain at the school. It soon, however, became <lb/>
evident that they would not be long in following Maria and <lb/>
Elizabeth unless they were removed; and they returned <lb/>
<pb n="103" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0118"/>
home before the rigours of another winter set in. All the <lb/>
physical and mental tortures she endured at Cowan Bridge, <lb/>
Charlotte afterwards described in the account she gives of <lb/>
"Lowood" in <hi rend="italic">Jane Eyre</hi>. It is not to be taken that the account <lb/>
of "Lowood" is as strictly an accurate description of Cowan <lb/>
Bridge as Charlotte Bront&euml; would have given if she had <lb/>
been simply writing a history of the school. The facts are, <lb/>
perhaps, magnified by the lurid glow of passion and grief <lb/>
with which she recalled her sisters' sufferings. She was <lb/>
only between nine and ten when she left Cowan Bridge, <lb/>
and in the account she wrote of it twenty years later we <lb/>
see rather the impression that was left on her imagination <lb/>
than a strictly accurate history; but there is no doubt that <lb/>
in her account of Maria Bront&euml;'s angelic patience, and the <lb/>
cruel persecution to which she was subjected by one of the <lb/>
teachers, the Lowood of <hi rend="italic">Jane Eyre</hi> is a perfectly faithful <lb/>
transcript of what took place at Cowan Bridge. Mrs. <lb/>
Gaskell says, "Not a word of that part of <hi rend="italic">Jane Eyre</hi> but is <lb/>
a literal repetition of scenes between the pupil and the <lb/>
teacher. Those who had been pupils at the same time <lb/>
knew who must have written the book from the force with <lb/>
which Helen Burns's sufferings are described."</p>
<p>After the death of Maria and Elizabeth, the next great <lb/>
sorrow of the Bront&euml; family arose from the career of the <lb/>
only son, Patrick Branwell. He was a handsome boy of <lb/>
exceptional mental powers. He had in particular the gift <lb/>
of brilliant conversation, and there was hardly anything he <lb/>
attempted in the way of talking, writing, or drawing which <lb/>
he did not do well. In one of Charlotte's letters she says, <lb/>
"You ask me if I do not think that men are strange <lb/>
beings? I do, indeed. I have often thought so; and I <lb/>
think, too, that the mode of bringing them up is strange; <lb/>
they are not sufficiently guarded from temptation. Girls <lb/>
are protected as if they were something very frail and silly <lb/>
indeed, while boys are turned loose on the world, as if they <lb/>
of all beings in existence were the wisest and least liable to <lb/>
be led astray." Poor Branwell, with his brilliant social <lb/>
qualities, was not sufficiently guarded from temptation. <lb/>
<pb n="104" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0119"/>
The easiest outlet from the narrow walls of Haworth <lb/>
parsonage was to be found at the little inn of Haworth <lb/>
village. The habit of the place was, when any stranger <lb/>
arrived at the inn, for the host to send for the brilliant boy <lb/>
from the parsonage to amuse the guest. The result will <lb/>
easily be guessed. The guiding principle of Charlotte's <lb/>
character was her inexorable fidelity to duty; her whole <lb/>
nature turned with irresistible force to what was right <lb/>
rather than to what was pleasant. With Branwell the reverse <lb/>
was the case. Conventional propriety of course strictly <lb/>
guarded Charlotte from the possible dangers of associating <lb/>
with casual strangers at the village inn, although her <lb/>
strong resolute character would not have run a tenth part <lb/>
of the risk of contamination as did that of the weak, <lb/>
pleasure-seeking Branwell. It is needless to dwell on the <lb/>
details of his gradual degradation; the high ideals and <lb/>
hopes of his youth were given up; his character became at <lb/>
once coarse and weak. He was entirely incapable of <reg orig="self-|government">self-government</reg> <lb/>
and of retaining any kind of respectable <lb/>
employment. His intemperance and other vices made the <lb/>
daily life of his sisters at the parsonage a nightmare of <lb/>
horrors. For eight years the young man, whose boyhood <lb/>
his family had watched with so much hope and pride, was <lb/>
a source of shame and anguish to them, all the more keenly <lb/>
felt because it could not be openly avowed. Many who <lb/>
knew the family affirmed that so far as purely intellectual <lb/>
qualities were concerned Branwell was even more eminently <lb/>
distinguished than his sisters; but mere intellect, without <lb/>
moral power to guide it, is as dangerous as a spirited horse <lb/>
without bit or bridle. Branwell was singularly deficient <lb/>
in that moral power in which his sisters were so strong, <lb/>
and his education did nothing to supply this natural <lb/>
deficiency. He died in 1848, at the age of thirty.</p>
<p>Cowan Bridge was not the only experience Charlotte <lb/>
and Emily had of school life. They went for a time to <lb/>
another school at Roe Head, where Charlotte was very <lb/>
happy, and in 1835 she returned to the same school as a <lb/>
teacher. In 1842 Charlotte and Emily went to a school <lb/>
<pb n="105" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0120"/>
in Brussels, where the former stayed two years, the latter <lb/>
only one. All that Charlotte saw and all the friends she <lb/>
made were afterwards portrayed in her stories. One of <lb/>
her most intimate friends became the Caroline Helstone <lb/>
of <hi rend="italic">Shirley;</hi> the originals of Rose and Jessie Yorke were <lb/>
also among her schoolfellows at Roe Head. There can be <lb/>
little doubt that M. Paul Emanuel of Villette was M. H&eacute;ger <lb/>
of the Brussels school. Every trivial circumstance of an <lb/>
unusually uneventful life became food for her imagination.</p>
<p>The development of Emily's genius was different. Her <lb/>
love of the moors around Haworth was so intense that it <lb/>
was impossible for her to thrive when she was away from <lb/>
them. It became a fact recognised by all the family that <lb/>
Emily must not be taken away from home. The solitude <lb/>
of the wild, dark moors, and the communing with her own <lb/>
heart, together with the dark tragedy of Branwell's wasted <lb/>
life, were the sole sources of Emily's inspiration. Her <lb/>
poems have a wild, untameable quality in them, and her <lb/>
one romance, <hi rend="italic">Wuthering Heights,</hi> places her in the first <lb/>
rank among the great imaginative writers of English fiction. <lb/>
There is something terrible in Emily's sternness of character, <lb/>
which she never vented pitilessly on any one but herself. <lb/>
She was deeply reserved, and hardly ever, even to her <lb/>
sisters, spoke of what she felt most intensely. A friend <lb/>
who furnished Mrs. Gaskell with some particulars for her <lb/>
biography, states that on one occasion she mentioned "that <lb/>
some one had asked me what religion I was of &lpar;with the <lb/>
view of getting me for a partisan&rpar;, and that I had said <lb/>
that was between God and me. Emily, who was lying on <lb/>
the hearth-rug, exclaimed, 'That's right.' This was all," <lb/>
adds the friend, "I ever heard Emily say on religious <lb/>
subjects." Emily's love for animals was intense; she <lb/>
was especially devoted to a savage old bull-dog named <lb/>
Keeper, who owned no master but herself. The incident <lb/>
in <hi rend="italic">Shirley</hi> of the heroine being bitten by a mad dog, <lb/>
and straightway burning the wound herself with a red-hot <lb/>
Italian iron, was true of Emily. Her last illness was a <lb/>
time of terrible agony to Charlotte and Anne, not merely <lb/>
<pb n="106" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0121"/>
because they saw that she who, Charlotte said, was the <lb/>
thing that seemed nearest to her heart in the world was <lb/>
going to be taken from them, but because Emily's resistance <lb/>
to the inroads of illness was so terrible. She resolutely <lb/>
refused to see a doctor, and she would allow no nursing <lb/>
and no tender helpfulness of any kind. It was evident to <lb/>
her agonised sisters that she was dying, but she maintained <lb/>
her savage reserve, suffering in solitary silence rather than <lb/>
admit her pain and weakness. On the very day of her <lb/>
death she rose as usual, dressed herself, and attempted to <lb/>
carry on her usual employments, and all this with the <lb/>
catching, rattling breath and the glazing eye which told <lb/>
that the hand of Death was actually upon her. Charlotte <lb/>
wrote in this agonising hour, "Moments so dark as these <lb/>
I have never known. I pray for God's support to us all. <lb/>
Hitherto He has granted it." At noon on that day, when <lb/>
it was too late, Emily whispered in gasps, "If you will send <lb/>
for a doctor, I will see him now." A few days later <lb/>
Charlotte wrote, "We are very calm at present. Why <lb/>
should we be otherwise? The anguish of seeing her suffer <lb/>
is over; the spectacle of the pains of death is gone by; the <lb/>
funeral day is past. We feel she is at peace. No need to <lb/>
tremble for the hard frost and the keen wind. Emily does <lb/>
not feel them." The terrible anguish of those last days <lb/>
haunted the surviving sisters like a vision of doom. Nearly <lb/>
six months later Charlotte wrote again that nothing but <lb/>
hope in the life to come had kept her heart from breaking. <lb/>
"I cannot forget," she says, "Emily's death-day; it <reg orig="be-|comes">becomes</reg> <lb/>
a more fixed, a darker, a more frequently recurring <lb/>
idea in my mind than ever. It was very terrible. She <lb/>
was torn, conscious, panting, reluctant, though resolute, out <lb/>
of a happy life." Within a very short time the gentle <lb/>
youngest sister Anne also died, and Charlotte was left with <lb/>
her father, the last survivor of the family of six wonderful <lb/>
children who had come to Haworth twenty-nine years <lb/>
before.</p>
<p>In earlier and happier days the habit of the sisters had <lb/>
been, when their aunt went to bed at nine o'clock, to put out <lb/>
<pb n="107" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0122"/>
the candles and pace up and down the room discussing the <lb/>
plots of their novels, and making plans and projects for <lb/>
their future life. Now Charlotte was left to pace the room <lb/>
alone, with all that had been dearest to her in the world <lb/>
under the church pavement at Haworth and in the old <lb/>
churchyard at Scarborough. But Charlotte was not one to <lb/>
give way to self-indulgent idleness, even in the hour of <lb/>
darkest despair. She was writing <hi rend="italic">Shirley</hi> at the time of <lb/>
Anne's last illness. After the death of this beloved and <lb/>
only remaining sister, she resumed her task; but those who <lb/>
knew what her private history at the time was, can trace <lb/>
in the pages of the novel what she had gone through. <lb/>
The first chapter she wrote after the death of Anne is called, <lb/>
"The Valley of the Shadow of Death."</p>
<p>The first venture in authorship of the sisters was a <lb/>
volume of poems, to which they each contributed. They <lb/>
imagined, probably with justice, that the world was at that <lb/>
time prejudiced against literary women. Therefore they <lb/>
were careful to conceal, even from their publishers, their <lb/>
real identity. The poems were published as the writings <lb/>
of Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Jane Eyre</hi> was the first of Charlotte's stories which <lb/>
was published, but <hi rend="italic">The Professor</hi> was the first that was <lb/>
written with a view to publication. The sisters each <lb/>
wrote a story&mdash;Charlotte, <hi rend="italic">The Professor;</hi> Emily, <hi rend="italic">Wuthering <lb/>
Heights;</hi> and Anne, <hi rend="italic">Agnes Grey,</hi> and sent them to <lb/>
various publishers. Charlotte was the only one of the three <lb/>
sisters whose manuscript was returned on her hands. But <lb/>
she was not discouraged by the disappointment. Just at <lb/>
this time Mr. Bront&euml;, who had been suffering from cataract, <lb/>
was persuaded by his daughters to go to Manchester for <lb/>
an operation. Charlotte accompanied him, and it was <lb/>
while she was waiting on him, in the long suspense after <lb/>
the operation had been performed, that she began <hi rend="italic">Jane <lb/>
Eyre,</hi> the book that made her, and ultimately the name of <lb/>
Bront&euml;, famous. Nothing is more striking in Charlotte's <lb/>
personal history than the way in which she reproduced <lb/>
the events and personages of her own circle into her novels. <lb/>
<pb n="108" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0123"/>
Probably the belief that she was writing anonymously <lb/>
encouraged her in this. Her father's threatened blindness <lb/>
and her own fear of a similar calamity are reflected, as it <lb/>
were, in the blindness of Rochester in <hi rend="italic">Jane Eyre</hi>. The <lb/>
success of <hi rend="italic">Jane Eyre</hi> was rapid and complete, and there <lb/>
was much dispute whether its author were a man or a <lb/>
woman. The <hi rend="italic">Quarterly Review</hi> distinguished itself by the <lb/>
remark that if the author were a woman it was evident <lb/>
"she must be one who for some sufficient reason has long <lb/>
forfeited the society of her sex." Sensitive as Charlotte <lb/>
Bront&euml; was, the coarseness of the insult could not wound <lb/>
her; it could at the utmost be regarded as nothing worse <lb/>
than a trivial annoyance; for when the words reached <lb/>
Charlotte, the grave had not long closed over Branwell's <lb/>
wasted life; Emily was just dead, and it was evident that <lb/>
Anne was dying. The greatness of her grief and the <lb/>
anguish of her loneliness dwarfed to their proper <reg orig="pro-|portions">proportions</reg> <lb/>
the petty insults that at another time would have <lb/>
caused her acute pain. On the whole she had nothing to <lb/>
complain of in the way her book was received; she suffered <lb/>
no lack of generous appreciation from the real leaders of <lb/>
the literary world. Thackeray and G. H. Lewes, Miss <lb/>
Martineau, and Sidney Dobell were warm in their praise <lb/>
of her work. Charlotte's manner of making her literary <lb/>
fame known to her father was characteristic. The secret <lb/>
of their authorship had been very strictly kept by the sisters; <lb/>
but when the success of <hi rend="italic">Jane Eyre</hi> was assured, Emily <lb/>
and Anne urged Charlotte that their father ought to be <lb/>
allowed to share the pleasure of knowing that she was the <lb/>
writer of the book. Accordingly one afternoon Charlotte <lb/>
entered her father's study and said, "Papa, I've been <lb/>
writing a book." When Mr. Bront&euml; found that the book <lb/>
was not only written, but printed and published, he <lb/>
exclaimed, "My dear, you've never thought of the expense <lb/>
it will be! It will be almost sure to be a loss, for how can <lb/>
you get a book sold? No one knows you or your name."</p>
<p>"But, papa, I don't think it will be a loss; no more <lb/>
will you, if you will just let me read you a review or two, <lb/>
<pb n="109" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0124"/>
and tell you more about it." At tea that evening Mr <lb/>
Bront&euml; exclaimed to his other daughters, "Girls, do you <lb/>
know that Charlotte has been writing a book, and it is <lb/>
much better than likely?"</p>
<p>The pacing up and down of the sisters in the firelight, <lb/>
discussing the plots of their novels, has been already <lb/>
mentioned. Mrs. Gaskell records that Charlotte told her <lb/>
that these discussions seldom had any effect in causing her <lb/>
to change the events in her stories, "so possessed was she <lb/>
with the feeling that she had described reality." This <lb/>
confirms what Mr. Swinburne has said of her strongest <lb/>
characteristic as an author, that she has the power of <lb/>
making the reader feel in every nerve that thus and not <lb/>
otherwise it must have been. It must not, however, be <lb/>
thought that the conversations with her sisters were therefore <lb/>
useless; no doubt they were very stimulating to her <lb/>
imagination, and gave her creations more solid reality than <lb/>
they would otherwise have had.</p>
<p>In 1854 Charlotte Bront&euml; married Mr. Nicholls, an Irish <lb/>
gentleman, who had for eight years been her father's curate. <lb/>
She only lived nine months after her marriage. She was <lb/>
happy in her husband's love, and appreciated his devotion <lb/>
to his parish duties. But the loving admirers of Charlotte <lb/>
Bront&euml; can never feel much enthusiasm for Mr. Nicholls. <lb/>
Mrs. Gaskell states that he was not attracted by her literary <lb/>
fame, but was rather repelled by it; he appears to have <lb/>
used her up remorselessly, in their short married life, in <lb/>
the routine drudgery of parish work. She did not <reg orig="com-|plain">complain</reg>; <lb/>
on the contrary, she seemed more than contented <lb/>
to sacrifice everything for him and his work; but she <lb/>
remarks in one of her letters, "I have less time for <reg orig="think-|ing">thinking</reg>." <lb/>
Apparently she had none for writing. Surely the <lb/>
husband of a Charlotte Bront&euml;, just as much as the wife of a <lb/>
Wordsworth or a Tennyson, ought to be attracted by literary <lb/>
fame. To be the life partner of one to whom the most <lb/>
precious of Nature's gifts is confided, and to be <reg orig="un-|appreciative">unappreciative</reg> <lb/>
of it and even repelled by it, shows a littleness <lb/>
of nature and essential meanness of soul. A true wife or <lb/>
<pb n="110" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0125"/>
husband of one of these gifted beings should rather regard <lb/>
herself or himself as responsible to the world for making the <lb/>
conditions of the daily life of their distinguished partners <lb/>
favourable to the development of their genius. But pearls <lb/>
have before now been cast before swine, and one cannot <lb/>
but regret that Charlotte Bront&euml; was married to a man <lb/>
who did not value her place in literature as he ought.</p>

ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Sydney Smith</hi>, writing in 1810 upon the extraordinary <lb/>
folly of closing to women all the ordinary means of literary <lb/>
education, remarked that one consequence of their exclusion <lb/>
was that no woman had contributed anything of lasting <lb/>
value to English, French, or Italian literature, and that <lb/>
scarcely a single woman had crept into the ranks even of <lb/>
the minor poets. While he was writing this, a little baby <lb/>
girl was beginning to prattle, who within a very short time <lb/>
was destined to win a place among the great poets of this <lb/>
century. The very great gifts of Elizabeth Barrett were <lb/>
discernible from her earliest childhood. Her father was <lb/>
Mr. Edward Moulton, of Burn Hall, Durham. The date <lb/>
and place of her birth are disputed. Mrs. Richmond Ritchie <lb/>
states in the <hi rend="italic">National Dictionary of Biography</hi> that the future <lb/>
poetess was born at Burn Hall, Durham, in 1809; Mr. J. <lb/>
H. Ingram says in his <hi rend="italic">Life of Mrs. Browning</hi> in the Eminent <lb/>
Women Series that she was born in London in 1809; while <lb/>
Mr. Browning has written to the papers to say that she <lb/>
was born at Carlton Hall, Durham, in 1806. Three <reg orig="birth-|places">birthplaces</reg> <lb/>
and two birthdays are thus assigned to her. It is not, <lb/>
however, disputed that she was christened by the names of <lb/>
Elizabeth Barrett, and that her father afterwards exchanged <lb/>
the name of Moulton for that of Barrett on inheriting some <lb/>
property from a relative. At eight years old little Elizabeth <lb/>
<pb n="112" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0127"/>
could read Homer in the original Greek, and was often to be <lb/>
seen with the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> in one hand and a doll in the other; <lb/>
this picture of her gives a beautiful type of her future <lb/>
character, its depth of loving womanliness, combined with <lb/>
the height of poetic inspiration and learning. She was <lb/>
certainly one of the women of whom her brother poet, <lb/>
Tennyson, sings, who "gain in mental breadth nor fail in <lb/>
childward care." She says herself of her childhood that <lb/>
"she dreamed more of Agamemnon than of Moses her <lb/>
black pony." At about eleven years old she wrote an epic <lb/>
poem in four books on <hi rend="italic">The Battle of Marathon,</hi> which <lb/>
her father caused to be printed. Her home, during most <lb/>
of her childhood, was at Hope End, near Ledbury, in <lb/>
Herefordshire. Many pictures of her happy childhood <lb/>
among the beautiful hills and orchards of the West country <lb/>
are to be found in the poems, especially in "Hector in the <lb/>
Garden" and in her "Lost Bower." Much of her young <lb/>
life, too, is described in the earlier part of her greatest <lb/>
work, <hi rend="italic">Aurora Leigh</hi>. We do not hear much about the <lb/>
mother of the poetess, but her grandmother, it is said, <lb/>
looked with much disfavour on the little lady's learning, <lb/>
and said she would "rather hear that Elizabeth's hemming <lb/>
were more carefully finished than of all this Greek." Her <lb/>
father, however, was a worthy guardian of the wonderful <lb/>
child that had been entrusted to him; he fostered and <lb/>
encouraged her genius by all means in his power. He <lb/>
must have had a singular power of self-devotion and <reg orig="self-|sacrifice">self-sacrifice</reg>; <lb/>
and it is probable that much of his daughter's <lb/>
beautiful moral nature was inherited from him. When <lb/>
Elizabeth was about twenty, her mother lay in her last <reg orig="ill-|ness">illness</reg>, <lb/>
and simultaneously money troubles, brought on by no <lb/>
fault of his own, fell upon Mr. Barrett. He would allow no <lb/>
knowledge of this to disturb his wife during her illness; <lb/>
and in order effectually to hide the truth from her, he made <lb/>
an arrangement with his creditors which very materially <lb/>
reduced his income for life, so that no reduction of his <lb/>
establishment should take place as long as his wife lived.</p>
<p>Two other misfortunes had an important influence on <lb/>
<pb n="113" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0128"/>
Elizabeth Barrett's youth. When she was about fifteen, <lb/>
she was trying to saddle her pony by herself in the paddock, <lb/>
when she was thrown to the ground, and her spine was <reg orig="in-|jured">injured</reg> <lb/>
in a manner that kept her lying on her back for <lb/>
four years. Scarcely had she recovered from this injury, <lb/>
when another terrible calamity nearly overwhelmed her. <lb/>
She had been sent to Torquay for the benefit of her health, <lb/>
and had been there nearly a year, when her eldest brother <lb/>
came to visit her, in order to consult her about some <lb/>
trouble of his own. With two other young men, all good <lb/>
sailors, he took a little boat, intending to have a sail along <lb/>
the coast. Within a few minutes of starting, and almost <lb/>
under his sister's window, the boat went down, and young <lb/>
Barrett and his companions were drowned. The grief and <lb/>
horror caused by this terrible event nearly killed her. It <lb/>
was almost a year before she could be moved by slow <lb/>
stages of twenty miles a day to London. Those who knew <lb/>
her best at that time believe that she would have died if <lb/>
she had not been sustained by her love of literary pursuits, <lb/>
which afforded some relief to her mind from the constant <lb/>
dwelling on the tragedy of which she accused herself of <lb/>
being the cause. Miss Mitford says in her <hi rend="italic">Literary <reg orig="Recol-|lections">Recollections</reg>:</hi> <lb/>
"The house she occupied at Torquay had been <lb/>
chosen as one of the most sheltered in the place. It stood <lb/>
at the bottom of the cliffs, almost close to the sea; and she <lb/>
told me herself that during that whole winter the sound of <lb/>
the waves rang in her ears like the moans of one dying. <lb/>
Still she clung to literature and Greek; in all probability <lb/>
she would have died without that wholesome diversion to <lb/>
her thoughts. Her medical attendant did not always <lb/>
understand this. To prevent the remonstrance of her <lb/>
friendly physician, Dr. Barry, she caused a small edition of <lb/>
Plato to be so bound as to resemble a novel. He did not <lb/>
know, skilful and kind though he were, that to her such <lb/>
books were not an arduous and painful study, but a <reg orig="con-|solation">consolation</reg> <lb/>
and a delight." She, however, appeared to be <reg orig="con-|demned">condemned</reg> <lb/>
to a life of perpetual invalidism. She now lived <lb/>
in London with her father, and was confined to one large <lb/>
<pb n="114" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0129"/>
darkened room, and saw no one but her own family, and a <lb/>
few intimate friends, the chief of whom were Miss Mitford, <lb/>
Mrs. Jameson, and Mr. John Kenyon. The impression <lb/>
she produced on all who came into contact with her was <lb/>
that she was the most charming and delightful person they <lb/>
had ever met. Her sweetness, her purity, and the tender <lb/>
womanliness of her character, made her friends forget her <lb/>
learning and her genius. Miss Mitford says she often <lb/>
travelled five-and-forty miles expressly to see her, and <reg orig="re-|turned">returned</reg> <lb/>
the same evening without entering another house. <lb/>
The seclusion in which she lived was perhaps not <reg orig="unfavour-|able">unfavourable</reg> <lb/>
to literary work. She lay on her couch, not only, as <lb/>
Miss Mitford says, reading every book worth reading in <lb/>
almost every language, but "giving herself heart and soul to <lb/>
that poetry of which she seemed born to be the priestess." <lb/>
In 1835 she published <hi rend="italic">Prometheus and other Poems,</hi> which, <lb/>
in the opinion of the most competent judges, raised her at <lb/>
once to a high rank among English poets. In 1843 she <lb/>
wrote <hi rend="italic">The Cry of the Children,</hi> to which Lord Shaftesbury <lb/>
owed so much in his efforts to protect factory children <lb/>
from being ground to death by overwork; and later she <lb/>
wrote the noble "Song for the Ragged Schools of London," <lb/>
whose words go straight to every mother's heart.</p>
<p>During her long period of illness her chief link with the <lb/>
outside world was her cousin, Mr. John Kenyon, to whom <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Aurora Leigh</hi> is dedicated. He knew all who were best <lb/>
worth knowing in the great world of London, and he <reg orig="occa-|sionally">occasionally</reg> <lb/>
introduced to her one and another of those whom <lb/>
he believed to be most capable of appreciating her and <lb/>
pleasing her. In this way, in 1846, he brought Mr. Robert <lb/>
Browning to see Miss Barrett. In the autumn of that same <lb/>
year the poet and poetess were married. What his love was <lb/>
for her and hers for him may be gathered in the lovely <lb/>
poem, "Caterina to Camoens," and in the forty-three <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Sonnets from the Portuguese,</hi> which Mrs. Browning wrote <lb/>
before her marriage. Almost directly after her marriage <lb/>
Mrs. Browning was ordered abroad for the benefit of her <lb/>
health, and the chief part of the remaining fifteen years of <lb/>
<pb n="115" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0130"/>
her life was spent in Italy. She identified herself <reg orig="com-|pletely">completely</reg> <lb/>
with those who were struggling for the unity and <lb/>
independence of Italy, and much of her poetry from this <lb/>
time onwards is coloured by her political convictions. In <lb/>
Florence, in 1849, her only child, Robert Browning the <lb/>
younger, was born. The deep joy of motherhood suffuses <lb/>
much of the noblest part of <hi rend="italic">Aurora Leigh.</hi> One is <lb/>
tempted to believe that the lovely description of Marian <lb/>
Erle bending over her sleeping child, <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>The yearling creature, warm and moist with life</l>
<l>To the bottom of his dimples,</l>
</lg></q>
could have been written by no one who had not felt a <lb/>
mother's love. In any case, it adds to one's pleasure in <reg orig="read-|ing">reading</reg> <lb/>
it to know that the poetess was drawing her inspiration <lb/>
from her own excessive happiness in the bliss of motherhood.</p>
<p>Many have singled out Mrs. Browning's <hi rend="italic">Sonnets from <lb/>
the Portuguese</hi> as her chief work. Mrs. Ritchie, in a <lb/>
very interesting article in the <hi rend="italic">National Dictionary of <reg orig="Bio-|graphy">Biography</reg>,</hi> <lb/>
says of them, "There is a quality in them which <lb/>
is beyond words: an echo from afar, which belongs to the <lb/>
highest human expression of feeling." Many other of <lb/>
the best judges have said they are among the greatest <lb/>
sonnets in the English language. But the work for which <lb/>
the world is most deeply in her debt is <hi rend="italic">Aurora Leigh</hi>. <lb/>
It probes to the bottom, but with a hand guided by purity <lb/>
and justice, those social problems which lie at the root of <lb/>
what are known as women's questions. Her intense feeling <lb/>
that the honour of manhood can never be reached while the <lb/>
honour of womanhood is sullied; her no less profound <reg orig="con-|viction">conviction</reg> <lb/>
that people can never be raised to a higher level by <lb/>
mere material prosperity, make this book one of the most <lb/>
precious in our language. She herself speaks of it in the <lb/>
dedication as "The most mature of my works, and the one <lb/>
into which my highest convictions upon Life and Art have <lb/>
entered." If she had written nothing else, she would stand <lb/>
out as one of the epoch-making poets of the present century.</p>
<p>Mr. Browning has published some interesting <reg orig="informa-|tion">information</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="116" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0131"/>
as to the manner in which he and his wife worked. <lb/>
They were very careful not to influence each other's <lb/>
compositions unduly. Their styles in writing are entirely <lb/>
unlike. They abstained from reading each other's poems <lb/>
while they were in process of composition. Mrs. Browning <lb/>
always kept a low writing-table, with inkstand and pen <lb/>
upon it, by her side. Mr. Browning wrote: "My wife <lb/>
used to write it &lpar;<hi rend="italic">Aurora Leigh</hi>&rpar; and lay it down to hear <lb/>
our child spell, or when a visitor came in it was thrust <lb/>
under the cushions. At Paris, a year ago last March, she <lb/>
gave me the first six books to read, I never having seen a <lb/>
line before. She then wrote the rest and transcribed them <lb/>
in London, where I read them also. I wish, in one sense, <lb/>
that I had written and she had read it." No one but a <lb/>
poet could have expressed so perfectly the great pleasure <lb/>
the reading gave him. There is an anecdote that when <lb/>
the Brownings left Florence for London, in 1856, the box <lb/>
containing the MS. of <hi rend="italic">Aurora Leigh</hi> was lost at <reg orig="Mar-|seilles">Marseilles</reg>. <lb/>
It also contained the velvet suits and lace collars <lb/>
of the little boy; and it is said that Mrs. Browning was <lb/>
far more distressed at losing the latter than the former. <lb/>
However, both were fortunately recovered, for the box <reg orig="con-|taining">containing</reg> <lb/>
them was found by Mrs. Browning's brother in <lb/>
one of the dark recesses of the Marseilles Custom House.</p>
<p>As evidence of her position in the literary world, it <lb/>
may be mentioned that when Wordsworth died in 1850 <lb/>
the <hi rend="italic">Athen&oelig;um</hi> strongly urged that Mrs. Browning ought <lb/>
to be made Poet Laureate.</p>
<p>Her sympathy with Italy was so strong that it is <reg orig="be-|lieved">believed</reg> <lb/>
that the news of the death of Cavour, through whom <lb/>
in so large a measure the unity of Italy was achieved, <lb/>
hastened her own. She was very ill when the news <lb/>
reached her, and she died in Florence on 30th June 1861. <lb/>
The municipality of Florence placed a tablet upon her house <lb/>
expressing their gratitude and admiration for her, and saying <lb/>
that in her womanly heart she had reconciled the wisdom of <lb/>
the learned with the enthusiasm of the poet, and with her <lb/>
verses had made a golden ring uniting Italy with England.</p>

LADY SALE AND HER FELLOW-HOSTAGES <lb/>
IN AFGHANISTAN</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> first Napoleon is said to have remarked to Madame <lb/>
de Sta&euml;l that women had nothing to do with politics; <lb/>
whereupon the lady rejoined that women ought at least <lb/>
to be sufficiently acquainted with political subjects to <lb/>
understand the reason why their heads were cut off. <lb/>
When we read the account of the great sufferings of <lb/>
the English ladies who were held as prisoners or hostages <lb/>
by Akbar Khan in Afghanistan in 1842, we are reminded <lb/>
of Madame de Sta&euml;l's epigram, and think that they ought <lb/>
at least to have had the consolation of understanding the <lb/>
political meddling and muddling, which led to the <reg orig="pro-|longed">prolonged</reg> <lb/>
pain and danger to which they were subjected.</p>
<p>Afghanistan is a wild mountainous country beyond the <lb/>
north-west frontier of the British Empire in India. Its <lb/>
people consist of savage, desperate, lawless tribes, <reg orig="con-|stantly">constantly</reg> <lb/>
at war with one another; indeed, they are hardly <lb/>
ever united unless they are attacked by some foreign foe. <lb/>
They are particularly jealous of any kind of foreign <reg orig="in-|fluence">influence</reg> <lb/>
or interference. Every man among them is bred <lb/>
to arms, even children being provided with dangerous <lb/>
knives; they are trained to great endurance, they are <lb/>
splendid horsemen, and are proficient in many kinds of <lb/>
manly sports and martial exercises; but with these <reg orig="super-|ficially">superficially</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="118" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0133"/>
attractive qualities they possess others of a <reg orig="differ-|ent">different</reg> <lb/>
stamp, for they are treacherous, utterly regardless of <lb/>
truth, revengeful, bloodthirsty, sensual, and avaricious. <lb/>
It will thus be seen that both their good and their bad <lb/>
qualities render them particularly dangerous as foes. The <lb/>
character of their country is very much like their own. It <lb/>
is a land of rocky mountain passes, and a great part of it <lb/>
is savage and sterile. It is separated from India by narrow <lb/>
rocky defiles, the principal one of which, the Khyber pass, <lb/>
is twenty-eight miles long, and runs between lofty, almost <lb/>
perpendicular precipices; the pass itself is so covered with <lb/>
rocks and boulders that progress along it, even under the <lb/>
most favourable circumstances, must necessarily be very <lb/>
slow. The rocky precipices which command the pass are <lb/>
so steep that they cannot be mounted; but they are <reg orig="per-|forated">perforated</reg> <lb/>
by many natural caves, which for centuries have <lb/>
been the strongholds of bands of robbers. It is easy to <lb/>
understand that an army endeavouring to go through this <lb/>
pass is at a terrible disadvantage, and is almost entirely at <lb/>
the mercy of the wild tribes of warriors and robbers who <lb/>
infest the heights.</p>
<p>About 1838&ndash;39 there was more than usual of internal <lb/>
fighting between the savage tribes of Afghanistan. Some <lb/>
tribes wished for Dost Mahomed as their king, or Ameer, <lb/>
and others wished for Shaj Soojah. It was considered by <lb/>
those who directed the policy of the British Government in <lb/>
India, a favourable time for us to interfere. It appears to <lb/>
have been thought that we should make the ruler of <reg orig="Afghan-|istan">Afghanistan</reg> <lb/>
our friend, if he felt that he owed his throne to our <lb/>
espousal of his cause. It was, however, forgotten that, <reg orig="how-|ever">however</reg> <lb/>
much the Afghans quarrelled among themselves, they <lb/>
would forget all past enmities and unite against a foreigner <lb/>
who tried to intervene between them; and they would hate <lb/>
and despise any ruler who owed his nominal sovereignty <lb/>
to the help of foreign soldiers. Therefore, although the <lb/>
English succeeded, in the first instance, in driving away <lb/>
Dost Mahomed and making Shaj Soojah king, they soon <lb/>
found that this first success was the beginning of their <reg orig="diffi-|culties">difficulties</reg>. <lb/>
<pb n="119" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0134"/>
Sir George Lawrence has told the story in his <reg orig="in-|teresting">interesting</reg> <lb/>
book called <hi rend="italic">Forty-three Years of my Life in India,</hi> <lb/>
and another narrative of the same events may be found in <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Lady Sale's Journal</hi>. An Afghan horseman, with whom <lb/>
Sir George &lpar;then Major&rpar; Lawrence conversed, expressed <lb/>
the feelings of his countrymen and the difficulties of our <lb/>
position in a few words. "What could induce you," he <lb/>
said, "to squander crores of rupees<ref target="n2" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref>
<note id="n2" place="foot" n="1"><seg type="note-symbol"><hi rend="super">1</hi></seg><p>A crore of rupees is a million. At that time a rupee was worth 2s.; <lb/>
therefore a crore of rupees would equal &pound;100,000.</p></note>
 in coming to a poor <lb/>
rocky country like ours, without wood or water, and all in <lb/>
order to force upon us a kumbukbt &lpar;unlucky person&rpar; as a <lb/>
king, who, the moment you turn your backs, will be upset <lb/>
by Dost Mahomed, our <hi rend="italic">own</hi> king?"</p>
<p>However, for a time the English army in Afghanistan <lb/>
did not realise the difficult and dangerous position in which <lb/>
they were placed. Dost Mahomed fled; and not long after <lb/>
he surrendered himself to the English, and was sent, with <lb/>
his wives and children, as a prisoner of war to India. <lb/>
Everybody now thought all trouble and danger were over, <lb/>
and the married officers and men of the English garrison <lb/>
sent for their wives and children to join them at Cabul. <lb/>
Shaj Soojah was established there and received the <reg orig="con-|gratulations">congratulations</reg> <lb/>
of the English. Lawrence, however, observed <lb/>
that the Ameer's own subjects did not join in these <reg orig="con-|gratulations">congratulations</reg>, <lb/>
and moreover Shaj Soojah himself began to <lb/>
show signs of getting tired of his English friends. No <lb/>
special danger was, however, anticipated; the English <lb/>
envoy, Sir W. MacNaghten, was about to leave Cabul, <lb/>
having been appointed to the Governorship of Bombay. <lb/>
Had he left, he would have taken Lawrence with him as <lb/>
his secretary. When the preparations for his departure <lb/>
were nearly complete, the clouds that had long been <lb/>
gathering at last burst in storm. The Ghilzye tribe rose <lb/>
in rebellion because they had been deprived of an annual <lb/>
subsidy of &pound;3000, nominally paid them by Shaj Soojah, <lb/>
but really supplied by the British. This insurrection had <lb/>
the effect of a match applied to a train of gunpowder. <lb/>
<pb n="120" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0135"/>
The whole of Afghanistan was presently in arms; the <lb/>
safest and most easily defended routes for the return to <lb/>
India were cut off. The insurrection spread to Cabul <lb/>
itself; the houses of the English residents were attacked <lb/>
and burned, the Treasury was sacked, and several officers <lb/>
and men were murdered in the streets. An attempt to <lb/>
send help to the English from Jellalabad was unsuccessful; <lb/>
the Afghans were victorious, and held the small British <lb/>
force entirely in their power.</p>
<p>Sir George Lawrence and Lady Sale complain bitterly <lb/>
of the incapacity of those who were highest in command <lb/>
of the English military operations; they urged that the <lb/>
right thing to have done would have been to take the <lb/>
whole British force into the Bala Hissar, the citadel of <lb/>
Cabul, and hold it against all comers till reinforcements <lb/>
arrived. The time of year was mid-winter, and winter in <lb/>
Afghanistan is intensely severe. To have held the fort <lb/>
would have entailed far less difficulty and danger than to <lb/>
attempt to retreat by the fearful Khyber pass, the heights <lb/>
of which were held by bands of savage mountaineers. <lb/>
This rash and fatal course was, however, attempted, with <lb/>
the result, now well known, that of the whole army, with <lb/>
the exception of those who were held by the Afghans as <lb/>
prisoners or hostages, only one man, and he severely <lb/>
wounded, reached Jellalabad alive. Those who have <lb/>
seen Lady Butler's picture, "The Last of an Army," will <lb/>
be able to realise something of what the disaster of the <lb/>
Khyber pass was. Akbar Khan, a son of Dost Mahomed <lb/>
and the leading spirit of the Afghan chiefs, had said that <lb/>
he would destroy the army with the exception of one man <lb/>
who should be left to tell the tale, and he kept his word.</p>
<p>Before this fatal retreat was decided upon, attempts at <lb/>
negotiation with the Afghans were made; Akbar, in <reg orig="par-|ticular">particular</reg>, <lb/>
had repeatedly demanded that, as a pledge of good <lb/>
faith, the wives and children of the English officers and <lb/>
men should be delivered over to him as hostages. While <lb/>
the English were still in Cabul, this suggestion was naturally <lb/>
rejected with horror. Some officers declared they would <lb/>
<pb n="121" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0136"/>
rather shoot their wives with their own hands than put <lb/>
them in the power of Akbar. Akbar had shown himself <lb/>
desperately cruel and treacherous. He twice invited the <lb/>
English envoy, Sir W. MacNaghten, outside the <reg orig="encamp-|ment">encampment</reg> <lb/>
to consult with him and other chiefs as to the terms <lb/>
of capitulation. On the first occasion the envoy and his <lb/>
escort returned in safety, but the terms of the treaty agreed <lb/>
upon were, on the part of the Afghans, entirely set at <lb/>
naught. When the second conference was about to take <lb/>
place, the English were treacherously attacked and <reg orig="over-|powered">overpowered</reg>, <lb/>
and our envoy was murdered by Akbar with his <lb/>
own hands. It was not very likely therefore that the <reg orig="re-|peated">repeated</reg> <lb/>
demand of this man to have the English women <lb/>
and children placed in his control would be listened to, <lb/>
and it was not, in fact, conceded until it became evident <lb/>
that to continue to accompany the ill-fated army in its <lb/>
retreat meant certain death.</p>
<p>The retreat from Cabul began on the 6th January <lb/>
1842; the thermometer was ten degrees below zero&mdash;far <lb/>
colder than the coldest weather of an ordinary English <lb/>
winter. The night was spent in the open; part of the <lb/>
march had been through snow and slush, which wetted <lb/>
those on foot up to their knees. Lady Sale, who was <lb/>
riding, says her habit was like a sheet of ice. Many died <lb/>
of cold and exhaustion on the first night. The poor <lb/>
Sepoys, accustomed to the warmth of an Indian sun, were <lb/>
unable to handle their muskets, and when attacked by the <lb/>
murderous bands of Afghans that continually pursued the <lb/>
army, were cut down as helplessly as sheep. The <reg orig="suffer-|ings">sufferings</reg> <lb/>
of the women and children were terrible. One poor <lb/>
woman had lately been confined. She, as well as the others, <lb/>
was exposed to all the horrors of the Afghan winter, and <lb/>
to the chances of dying by the Afghan knife or bullet. <lb/>
Lady Sale, with her daughter Mrs. Sturt, showed a fine <lb/>
example of courage and endurance. Lawrence said she <lb/>
and all the ladies bore up so nobly and heroically against <lb/>
hunger, cold, and fatigue, as to call forth the admiration <lb/>
even of the Afghans themselves. It seems to have been <lb/>
<pb n="122" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0137"/>
known or rumoured that Akbar would make a special <lb/>
effort to get hold of the women, for Lady Sale and her <lb/>
daughter were advised to disguise themselves as much as <lb/>
possible, and to ride with the men, which they did, riding <lb/>
with Captain Hay's troopers. On the second day of the <lb/>
retreat they were heavily fired upon, Lady Sale was <lb/>
wounded, her daughter's horse was shot under her, and <lb/>
her son-in-law, Captain Sturt, was mortally injured. Let <lb/>
any one who likes to dwell on "the pomp and circumstance <lb/>
of glorious war" look on the reverse side of the picture. <lb/>
Captain Sturt had received a severe wound in the abdomen, <lb/>
from which it was from the first certain he could not <reg orig="re-|cover">recover</reg>. <lb/>
He was in great agony; it was impossible to move <lb/>
him without increasing his sufferings, equally impossible <lb/>
that he should not be moved. He was placed in a kind of <lb/>
rough litter, the jolting of which was a terrible aggravation <lb/>
of his pain. At night he lay on a bank in the snow, <reg orig="suffer-|ing">suffering</reg> <lb/>
from intolerable thirst; the water for which he craved <lb/>
could only be supplied, a few spoonfuls at a time, because <lb/>
his wife and mother had no means of getting a larger <lb/>
quantity. Those who have known what it is, even in the <lb/>
midst of every home comfort, to stand by the death-bed of <lb/>
those they love, can best imagine what it was to Lady Sale <lb/>
and her daughter to see the anguish and death of their son <lb/>
and husband under such circumstances as these. The <lb/>
horrors of the retreat became worse and worse. All the <lb/>
baggage was lost, and the whole road was covered with <lb/>
men, women, and children lying down in the snow to die.</p>
<p>Again Akbar renewed his demand for the women and <lb/>
children, and this time he urged it on grounds of humanity. <lb/>
It now appeared certain that the only chance of saving <lb/>
their lives was to accept Akbar's proposals. Nine ladies, <lb/>
twenty gentlemen, and fourteen children were accordingly <lb/>
made over to him as prisoners or hostages. It is true that <lb/>
he assured them that they were to consider themselves his <lb/>
honoured guests, and that on the whole he behaved well to <lb/>
them, but their sufferings while in his charge were very <lb/>
considerable. They believed themselves to be in constant <lb/>
<pb n="123" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0138"/>
danger of death, or else that they would be sold as slaves <lb/>
and sent to Bokhara. All their arms and means of defence <lb/>
were taken from them, and they were but too well <reg orig="ac-|quainted">acquainted</reg> <lb/>
with the treacherous and cruel nature of the man <lb/>
whose prisoners they were.</p>
<p>The most noticeable feature of Lady Sale's journal is <lb/>
its buoyant courage and cheerfulness. The forty-three <lb/>
persons of whom the hostages consisted were reinforced <lb/>
by the birth of three infants, one of which was Mrs. <lb/>
Sturt's, and consequently was Lady Sale's grandchild. <lb/>
They were eight and a half months in captivity. Their <lb/>
accommodation very often consisted of no more than two <lb/>
small rooms among the whole party. Lady Sale speaks <lb/>
of being lodged twenty-one in a room fourteen feet by ten <lb/>
feet; another time thirty-four persons had to share a room <lb/>
only fifteen feet by twelve feet; sixteen persons, of both <lb/>
sexes and all ages, shared one small room for a long time. <lb/>
Lady Sale and her daughter&mdash;indeed, most of the captives <lb/>
&mdash;had lost everything but the clothes they stood in. Yet, <lb/>
in the midst of all the discomfort and danger to which the <lb/>
party was exposed, there is seldom a word of complaint in <lb/>
Lady Sale's journal which she wrote at the time, and more <lb/>
often than not their hardships are turned into matter of <lb/>
laughter and merriment. The retreat from Cabul was <lb/>
begun, it will be remembered, on 6th January; on the 9th <lb/>
the ladies and children, with twenty gentlemen, among <lb/>
whom was Major Lawrence, were made over to Akbar <lb/>
Khan; not until 18th January were they established in <lb/>
permanent quarters in the fort of Buddeeabad. The <lb/>
journal for 19th January begins: "We luxuriated in <lb/>
dressing, although we had no clothes but those on our <lb/>
backs; but we enjoyed washing our faces very much, <lb/>
having had but one opportunity of doing so since we left <lb/>
Cabul. It was rather a painful process, as the cold and <lb/>
glare of the sun on the snow had three times peeled my <lb/>
face, from which the skin came off in strips." Major <lb/>
Lawrence describes the rooms assigned to the ladies as <lb/>
"miserable sheds full of fleas and bugs." But even these <lb/>
<pb n="124" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0139"/>
and worse trials to the temper were good-humouredly <reg orig="en-|countered">encountered</reg>. <lb/>
"It was above ten days," Lady Sale wrote, <lb/>
"after our departure from Cabul before I had an <reg orig="oppor-|tunity">opportunity</reg> <lb/>
to change my clothes, or even to take them off and <lb/>
put them on again and wash myself; and fortunate were <lb/>
those who did not possess much live stock. It was not <lb/>
till our arrival here &lpar;near Cabul, almost at the end of their <lb/>
captivity&rpar; that we completely got rid of <hi rend="italic">lice,</hi> which we <reg orig="de-|nominated">denominated</reg> <lb/>
infantry; the fleas, for which Afghanistan is <lb/>
famed, we called light cavalry." The food served out to <lb/>
the prisoners was the reverse of appetising: greasy skin <lb/>
and bones, boiled in the same pot with rice, and all served <lb/>
together, was a usual dish. Lady Sale describes a kind of <lb/>
bread made of unpollarded flour mixed with water, and <lb/>
dried by being set up on edge near a fire. "Eating these <lb/>
cakes of dough," she says, "is a capital recipe for <reg orig="heart-|burn">heartburn</reg>." <lb/>
The bad cooking they remedied by obtaining leave <lb/>
to cook for themselves.</p>
<p>One of the chief alleviations of their lot consisted&mdash;so <lb/>
far, at least, as the ladies were concerned&mdash;in needlework; <lb/>
they were supplied with calico, chintz, and other materials, <lb/>
and were most thankful, not only for the clothes which <lb/>
they were thus enabled to make, but also for the occupation <lb/>
the work afforded. The ladies also cheerfully bore their <lb/>
part in other kinds of work, and became laundresses, cooks, <lb/>
and housemaids, and, in one instance, carpenters and masons <lb/>
for the nonce. The choice of rooms being very limited, <lb/>
one was allotted to Lady Sale and her companions which <lb/>
had no windows, and consequently no means of getting air <lb/>
and light, except what came through the door. "We soon <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">set to,</hi>" writes Lady Sale, "and by dint of hard working <lb/>
with sticks and stones, in which I bore my part, assisted <lb/>
by Mr. Melville, until both of us got blistered hands, we <lb/>
knocked two small windows out of the wall, and thus <reg orig="ob-|tained">obtained</reg> <lb/>
'darkness visible.'" Lady Sale had permission to <lb/>
correspond with her husband, General Sir Robert Sale, who <lb/>
was conducting vigorous measures against the enemy at <lb/>
Jellalabad. Lady Sale was very proud of her husband, <lb/>
<pb n="125" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0140"/>
and mentions with evident delight the nickname of "<reg orig="Fight-|ing">Fighting</reg> <lb/>
Bob," which his soldiers had given him. Any <reg orig="recogni-|tion">recognition</reg> <lb/>
of his deserts gave her keen satisfaction. She refers <lb/>
to the presentation of a sword to him as "the only thing <lb/>
that has given me pleasure," although at that time her <lb/>
praises were upon everybody's lips. She was so thoroughly <lb/>
a soldier's wife that she understood military tactics: before <lb/>
she left Cabul she speaks of taking up a post of observation <lb/>
on the roof of the house, "as usual," in order to watch the <lb/>
military movements that were going forward. She says <lb/>
she understood the plan of attack as well as she <reg orig="under-|stood">understood</reg> <lb/>
the hemming of a handkerchief; therefore she <reg orig="dili-|gently">diligently</reg> <lb/>
wrote an account of everything of importance to <lb/>
her husband. These letters were so important for the <lb/>
military and political news they contained that they were <lb/>
often forwarded to the Commander-in-chief, to Lord <reg orig="Auck-|land">Auckland</reg>, <lb/>
the Governor-general, and to the Court of Directors <lb/>
of the East India Company.</p>
<p>The principal danger to which the prisoners were <reg orig="ex-|posed">exposed</reg>, <lb/>
next to the ferocity and treachery of Akbar Khan's <lb/>
character, arose from the extraordinary frequency of <reg orig="earth-|quakes">earthquakes</reg> <lb/>
in the region in which they were confined. Lady <lb/>
Sale is one of the very few human beings who has ever <lb/>
made such an entry in a journal as this: "3d and 4th <lb/>
March. Earthquakes as usual." Under other dates such <lb/>
expressions as "Earthquakes in plenty" are frequent; and <lb/>
hardly less significant is the entry, under the date of 19th <lb/>
April, "No earthquakes to-day." The earthquakes were <lb/>
of a most formidable character. Lady Sale had a narrow <lb/>
escape of destruction from one which took place in February. <lb/>
She was on the roof of the room she lived in, hanging out <lb/>
some clothes to dry, when the whole building began to rock; <lb/>
she felt the roof was giving way, and rushed down the stairs, <lb/>
just in time to save her life, as the building fell with an <lb/>
awful crash the instant she left it. Lawrence writes: "We <lb/>
all assembled in the centre of the court, as far from the <lb/>
crumbling walls as possible, &hellip; when suddenly the <reg orig="en-|tire">entire</reg> <lb/>
structure disappeared as through a trap-door, disclosing <lb/>
<pb n="126" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0141"/>
to us a yawning chasm. The stoutest hearts among us <lb/>
quailed at the appalling sight, for the world seemed coming <lb/>
to an end."</p>
<p>Almost the only angry words that appear in Lady Sale's <lb/>
journal are caused by attempts of the officers to negotiate <lb/>
a ransom for themselves and the rest of the party, without <lb/>
consulting the ladies as to the terms to be agreed upon. <lb/>
Women's suffrage had not been much talked of in 1842, <lb/>
but Lady Sale appeared to hold that taxation and <reg orig="represent-|ation">representation</reg> <lb/>
ought to go hand in hand; for she says, "A council <lb/>
of officers was held at the General's regarding this same <lb/>
ransom business, which they refer to Macgregor. I protest <lb/>
against being implicated in any proceedings in which I have <lb/>
no vote." In the end the Indian Government paid the sum <lb/>
that it was agreed to give to Saleh Mahomed for effecting <lb/>
the deliverance of the prisoners. Another source of <reg orig="irrita-|tion">irritation</reg> <lb/>
to Lady Sale was the dread lest the military authorities <lb/>
should hesitate to proceed vigorously against the Afghans <lb/>
at the right moment because it might endanger the lives of <lb/>
the hostages. "Now is the time," she wrote on the 10th <lb/>
May, "to strike the blow, but I much dread dilly-dallying <lb/>
just because a handful of us are in Akbar's power. What <lb/>
are <hi rend="italic">our</hi> lives compared with the honour of our country? <lb/>
Not that I am at all inclined to have my throat cut; on <lb/>
the contrary, I hope I shall live to see the British flag <lb/>
once more triumphant in Afghanistan."</p>
<p>Allusion has already been made to Lady Sale's power <lb/>
of extracting grim fun out of the discomforts of the <reg orig="situa-|tion">situation</reg>. <lb/>
The Afghans are great thieves, and one of the minor <lb/>
troubles of the captives lay in the fact that their captors <lb/>
calmly appropriated articles sent to the prisoners. They <lb/>
took possession of a case in which Lady Sale had left some <lb/>
small bottles. "I hope," she writes, "the Afghans will <lb/>
try their contents as medicine, and find them efficacious: <lb/>
one bottle contained nitric acid, another a strong solution <lb/>
of lunar caustic." Twice she was incapacitated by severe <lb/>
attacks of fever, which had proved fatal to several of the <lb/>
party; but her courage never deserted her; and she shook <lb/>
<pb n="127" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0142"/>
off fever and all other ills when she heard her husband was <lb/>
near. Saleh Mahomed had already agreed, for a sum of <lb/>
money, to remove them from Akbar's power, and they had <lb/>
left the place in which they had been confined; but Akbar <lb/>
would probably have recaptured them had not Sir R. Sale <lb/>
and Sir R. Shakespear with their brigades joined them just <lb/>
at the nick of time.</p>
<p>Who can tell what the meeting must have been between <lb/>
the gallant husband and wife? The narrative can best be <lb/>
given in Lady Sale's own words: "Had we not received <lb/>
assistance, our recapture was certain. &hellip; It is impossible <lb/>
to express our feelings on Sale's approach. To my daughter <lb/>
and myself happiness, so long delayed as to be almost <reg orig="un-|expected">unexpected</reg>, <lb/>
was actually painful, and accompanied by a <lb/>
choking sensation which could not obtain the relief of <lb/>
tears. When we arrived where the infantry were posted, <lb/>
they cheered all the captives as they passed them, and the <lb/>
men of the 13th" &lpar;her husband's regiment&rpar; "pressed <reg orig="for-|ward">forward</reg> <lb/>
to welcome us individually. Most of the men had <lb/>
a little word of hearty congratulation to offer each in his <lb/>
own style on the restoration of his colonel's wife and <lb/>
daughter; and then my highly-wrought feelings found the <lb/>
desired relief; I could scarcely speak to thank the soldiers <lb/>
for their sympathy, whilst the long-withheld tears now <lb/>
found their course."</p>

ELIZABETH GILBERT</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Elizabeth Gilbert</hi>, daughter of the Bishop of Chichester, <lb/>
was one of the blind who help the blind. It is true, <lb/>
physically, that the blind cannot lead the blind; but, <lb/>
perhaps, none are so well fitted as the blind, who are <lb/>
gifted with courage, sympathy, and hope, to show the way <lb/>
to careers of happy and active usefulness to those who are <lb/>
suffering from a similar calamity with themselves.</p>
<p>The Bishop's little daughter, born at Oxford in 1826, <lb/>
was not blind from her birth. She is described in the <lb/>
first years of infancy as possessing dark flashing eyes, that, <lb/>
no doubt, were as eager to see and know as other baby <lb/>
eyes. Her sight was taken from her by an attack of <lb/>
scarlet fever when she was two years and eight months <lb/>
old. Her mother had lately been confined, and, <reg orig="conse-|quently">consequently</reg>, <lb/>
was entirely isolated from the little invalid. The <lb/>
care of the child devolved upon her father, who nursed <lb/>
her most tenderly, and, by his ceaseless watchfulness and <lb/>
care, probably saved her life. But when the danger to <lb/>
life was passed, it was found that the poor little girl had <lb/>
lost her sight. Everything was done that could be done; <lb/>
the most skilful oculists and physicians of the day were <lb/>
consulted, but could do nothing except confirm the fears of <lb/>
her parents that their little girl was blind for life.</p>
<p>With this one great exception of blindness, Elizabeth <lb/>
<pb n="129" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0144"/>
Gilbert's childhood was peculiarly happy and fortunate. <lb/>
Her parents wisely determined to educate her, as much as <lb/>
possible, with their other children, and to avoid everything <lb/>
which could bring into prominence that she was not as the <lb/>
others were. There was a large family of the Gilbert <lb/>
children, and Bessie, as she was always called, like the <lb/>
others, was required to dress herself and wait on herself <lb/>
in many little ways that bring out a child's independence <lb/>
and helpfulness. She used to sit always by her father's <lb/>
side at dessert, and pour him out a glass of wine, which <lb/>
she did very cleverly without spilling a drop. When <lb/>
asked how she could do this, she replied it was quite easy <lb/>
&mdash;she judged by the weight when the glass was full. She <lb/>
learnt French, German, Italian, and music, with her sisters, <lb/>
and joined them in their games, both indoors and out. <lb/>
When she required special watching and care, they were <lb/>
given silently, without letting her find out that she was <lb/>
being singled out for protection. When she was old <lb/>
enough, the direction of the household and other domestic <lb/>
duties were entrusted to her in her parents' absence, in <lb/>
turn with her other sisters. Thus her ardour, relf-reliance, <lb/>
and courage were undamped, and she was prepared for <lb/>
the life's work to which she afterwards devoted herself&mdash; <lb/>
the industrial training of the adult blind. In 1842 an <lb/>
event happened which doubtless had a good effect in <lb/>
developing Miss Gilbert's natural independence of character, <lb/>
which had been so carefully preserved by her parents <lb/>
training. Her godmother died and left her a considerable <lb/>
sum of money, of which she was to enjoy the income as <lb/>
soon as she came of age. It was, therefore, in her power <lb/>
to carry out the scheme which she formed in after years <lb/>
for the benefit of the blind, without being obliged to rely <lb/>
at the outset on others for pecuniary support. She never <lb/>
could have done what she did if she had been obliged to <lb/>
ask her parents for the money the development of her <lb/>
plans necessarily required. They were most kindly and <lb/>
wisely generous to her, but it would have been impossible <lb/>
to one of her honourable and sensitive nature to spend <lb/>
<pb n="130" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0145"/>
freely and liberally as she did money which was not her <lb/>
own. The saddest and most desponding period of her life <lb/>
was that which came after she had ceased to be a child, <lb/>
and before she had taken up the life's work to which <lb/>
reference has just been made. She was one of a bevy of <lb/>
eight sisters; and they naturally, as they passed from <lb/>
childhood to womanhood, entered more and more into a <lb/>
world which was closed to their blind sister. At that <lb/>
time, even more than now, marriage was the one career for <lb/>
which all young women were consciously or unconsciously <lb/>
preparing. It was hard for a young girl to live in a social <lb/>
circle in which marriage was looked upon as the one <lb/>
honourable goal of female ambition, and to feel at the <lb/>
same time that it was one from which she was herself <lb/>
debarred. Those who saw her at this time, say she would <lb/>
often sit silent and apart in the drawing-room of her <lb/>
father's house in Queen Anne Street, with the tears <lb/>
streaming down her face, and that she would spend hours <lb/>
together on her knees weeping. "To the righteous there <lb/>
ariseth a light in darkness." The light-bringers to the sad <lb/>
heart of Bessie Gilbert were manifold; and as is usual in <lb/>
such cases, the light of her own life was found in working <lb/>
for the welfare of others. The most healing and cheering <lb/>
of words to those who are sick at heart are, "Come and <lb/>
work in My vineyard."</p>
<p>Small things often help great ones; and a clever <lb/>
mechanical invention by a Frenchman named Foucault, <lb/>
for enabling blind people to write, was not an unimportant <lb/>
link in the chain that drew Miss Gilbert out of her <lb/>
despondency. By means of this writing frame, she <lb/>
entered into correspondence with a young blind man, <lb/>
named William Hanks Levy, who had lately married the <lb/>
matron of the St. John's Wood School for the Blind. Levy <lb/>
entered with great zeal, enthusiasm, and originality into <lb/>
all the schemes Miss Gilbert began to form for the welfare <lb/>
of the blind. Her thoughts were further turned in the <lb/>
direction of working for the blind poor, by a book called <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Meliora,</hi> written by Lord Ingestre, the aim of which was to <lb/>
<pb n="131" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0146"/>
show how the gulf between rich and poor could be bridged <lb/>
over. But most important of all, perhaps, of the influences <lb/>
that were making a new outlook for her life, was her <lb/>
friendship with Miss Bathurst, daughter of Sir James <lb/>
Bathurst. This lady was deeply interested in all efforts <lb/>
to raise up and improve the lot of women, and especially <lb/>
devoted herself to opening the means of higher education <lb/>
to them. She was one of those who hoped all things and <lb/>
believed all things, and, consequently, she rebelled against <lb/>
the impious notion that if a woman were not married there <lb/>
was no use or place for her in the world. It was her clear <lb/>
strong faith in women's work and in women's worth, that <lb/>
helped more than anything else to give dignity, purpose, <lb/>
and happiness to Bessie Gilbert's life. The life of the <lb/>
blind girl became ennobled by the purpose to work for the <lb/>
good of others, and to help both women and men who <lb/>
were afflicted similarly with herself to make the best use <lb/>
of their lives that circumstances permitted.</p>
<p>Very little, comparatively, at that time had been done <lb/>
for the blind. The excellent college at Norwood did not <lb/>
exist. The poor blind very frequently became beggars, <lb/>
and the well-to-do blind, with few exceptions, were regarded <lb/>
as doomed to a life of uselessness; in some instances, as <lb/>
in Miss Gilbert's own, kindly and intelligent men thought <lb/>
it neither wrong nor unnatural to express a hope that "the <lb/>
Almighty would take the child who was afflicted with <lb/>
blindness." What was specially needed at the time Miss <lb/>
Gilbert's attention was directed to the subject was the <lb/>
means of industrial training, to enable those who had lost <lb/>
their sight in manhood or womanhood to earn their own <lb/>
living. The proficiency of the blind in music is well <lb/>
known, but to attain a high degree of excellence in this <lb/>
requires a training from early childhood. To those who <lb/>
become blind in infancy a musical education affords the <lb/>
best chance of future independence; but thousands become <lb/>
blind in later life, when they are too old to acquire <lb/>
professional skill as musicians; and, besides these, there <lb/>
are those who are too completely without the taste for <lb/>
<pb n="132" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0147"/>
music to render it possible for them to become either <lb/>
performers or teachers of it. It was especially for the <lb/>
poor adult blind that Miss Gilbert laboured. She studied <lb/>
earnestly to discover the various kinds of manual labour in <lb/>
which the blind stood at the least disadvantage in <reg orig="com-|parison">comparison</reg> <lb/>
with sighted persons. Her efforts had a humble <lb/>
beginning, for the first shop she opened was in a cellar in <lb/>
Holborn, which she rented at 1s. 6d. a week. She was <lb/>
ably seconded by Levy, and by a blind carpenter named <lb/>
Farrar; the cellar was used as a store for the mats, <lb/>
baskets, and brushes made by blind people in their own <lb/>
homes. A move was, however, soon made to a small <lb/>
house near Brunswick Square, but the work soon outgrew <lb/>
these premises also, and a house was taken, with a shop <lb/>
and workrooms, in what is now the Euston Road. Miss <lb/>
Gilbert exerted herself assiduously to promote the sale of <lb/>
the articles made by her clients. The goods were sold at <lb/>
the usual retail price, and their quality was in many <lb/>
respects superior to that of similar goods offered in <lb/>
ordinary shops; in this way a regular circle of customers <lb/>
was in time obtained, who were willing to buy of the <lb/>
blind what the blind were able to produce. It must not <lb/>
be supposed, however, that this process, which sounds so <lb/>
easy and simple in words, was really easy and simple in <lb/>
practice. The blind men and women had to be taught <lb/>
their trades; in the case of many of them, their health <lb/>
was below the average, and, in the case of a few, they <lb/>
were not quite clear that working had any advantages over <lb/>
begging, for a living. Miss Gilbert and her foreman, W. <lb/>
Levy, had industrial, physical, and moral difficulties to <lb/>
contend with that would have daunted any who were less <lb/>
firmly grounded in the belief in the permanent usefulness <lb/>
of what they had undertaken. Miss Gilbert found that <lb/>
many of the blind people she employed could not, with <lb/>
the best will in the world, earn enough to support <reg orig="them-|selves">themselves</reg>. <lb/>
The deficiency was for years made up from her <lb/>
own private means. W. Levy had what appears a <reg orig="mis-|taken">mistaken</reg> <lb/>
enthusiasm for employing none but blind persons <lb/>
<pb n="133" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0148"/>
in the various industries carried on in the workshop. <lb/>
There are some industrial processes for performing which <lb/>
blindness is an absolute bar, some in which it is a great <lb/>
disadvantage, others in which it is a slight disadvantage, <lb/>
and a few in which it is no disadvantage at all. The aim <lb/>
of those who wish to benefit the blind should be, in my <lb/>
judgment, to promote co-operation of labour between the <lb/>
blind and the seeing, so that to the blind may be left <lb/>
those processes in which the loss of sight places them <lb/>
at the least disadvantage. The blind Milton composed <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost,</hi> and other noble poems, which will live as <lb/>
long as the English language lasts. He never could have <lb/>
done this if the mechanical labour of writing down his <lb/>
compositions had not been given over to those who had <lb/>
the use of their eyes. This is an extreme instance, but it <lb/>
may be taken as an example of the way in which the <lb/>
blind and the seeing should work together, each doing the <lb/>
best their natural faculties and limitations fit them for. <lb/>
Levy had an intense pride in having everything in Miss <lb/>
Gilbert's institution done only by the blind. So far did <lb/>
he carry this prejudice that it was only with difficulty that <lb/>
he was induced to have a seeing assistant for keeping the <lb/>
accounts. Previous to this, as was natural and inevitable, <lb/>
they were in the most hopeless confusion. Levy was, <lb/>
however, in many ways an invaluable leader and <reg orig="fellow-|worker">fellowworker</reg>. <lb/>
His courage and energy were boundless. On <lb/>
one occasion he undertook successfully a journey to France <lb/>
in order to discover the place where some pretty baskets <lb/>
were made. He and his wife landed at Calais almost <lb/>
entirely ignorant of the French language, and knowing <lb/>
nothing except that certain baskets, for which there was <lb/>
then a good demand in England, were being manufactured <lb/>
in one of the eighty-nine departments of France. After <lb/>
many wanderings, both accidental and inevitable, he <lb/>
discovered the place. He was received with great <lb/>
kindness by the people who made the baskets, and, having <lb/>
learnt how to make them himself, he returned to England <lb/>
to communicate his knowledge to his and Miss Gilbert's <lb/>
<pb n="134" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0149"/>
company of blind workpeople. A letter of Levy's to Miss <lb/>
Gilbert, describing a fire that had broken out close to the <reg orig="insti-|tution">institution</reg>, <lb/>
and had for some time placed it in great danger, is <lb/>
a wonderful instance of a blind man's energy and power of <lb/>
acting promptly and courageously in the face of danger.</p>
<p>Little by little the work Miss Gilbert had begun grew <lb/>
and prospered. A regular society was formed, of which <lb/>
the Queen became the patron, and of which Miss Gilbert <lb/>
was the most active and devoted member. This association <lb/>
received the name of the Society for Promoting the <lb/>
General Welfare of the Blind. Its present habitation is <lb/>
in Berners Street, London. Its founder, for several years <lb/>
before her death, was obliged, through ill-health, to <reg orig="with-|draw">withdraw</reg> <lb/>
from all active participation in its business; but so <lb/>
well and firmly had she laid the foundations, that others <lb/>
were able to carry on what she had begun. The Society <lb/>
is one of the most useful in London for the poor adult <lb/>
blind, because it provides them with industrial training, <lb/>
according to their individual capacities, and secures them, <lb/>
as far as possible, a constant and regular market for the <lb/>
goods they are able to produce. The wages earned are <lb/>
in some cases supplemented by small grants, and pensions <lb/>
are, in several instances, given to those blind men and <lb/>
women who have survived their power of work. The <lb/>
result of Miss Gilbert's life has been to ameliorate very <lb/>
much the lot of the blind poor by substituting the means <lb/>
of self-supporting industry for the doles and alms which at <lb/>
one time were looked upon as the only means of showing <lb/>
kindness and pity to the blind. Miss Gilbert herself was <lb/>
keenly sensible of the value and life-giving power of work. <lb/>
Surrounded as she had been from childhood with every <lb/>
care and kindness which loving and generous parents could <lb/>
suggest, she yet found that when she began to work, the <lb/>
change was like a passing from death to life. The book <lb/>
from which all the facts and details in this sketch are <lb/>
taken<ref target="n3" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref>

 tells that soon after she began her work one of her <lb/>
<pb n="135" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0150"/>
friends "hoped she was not working herself to death." <lb/>
She replied, with a happy laugh, "Work myself to death? <lb/>
I am working myself to life." It is just this possibility of <lb/>
"working to life" that she has placed within the reach of <lb/>
so many blind men and women.</p>
<p>Miss Gilbert's health was always very fragile. After <lb/>
1872 she became by degrees a confirmed invalid, and after <lb/>
much suffering, borne with exquisite patience and <reg orig="cheer-|fulness">cheerfulness</reg>, <lb/>
she died early in the year 1885.</p>

JANE AUSTEN</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">There</hi> is very little story to tell in the life of Jane Austen. <lb/>
She was one of the greatest writers of English fiction; but <lb/>
her own life, like the life she describes with such <reg orig="extra-|ordinary">extraordinary</reg> <lb/>
and minute accuracy in her tales, had no startling <lb/>
incidents, no catastrophes. The solid ground never shook <lb/>
beneath her feet; neither she, nor the relations and <lb/>
neighbours with whom her tranquil life was passed, were <lb/>
ever swept away by the whirlwind of wild passions, nor <lb/>
overwhelmed by tragic destiny. The ordinary, everyday <lb/>
joys and sorrows that form a part of the lives of all of <lb/>
us, were hers; but nothing befell her more sensational or <lb/>
wondrous than what falls to the lot of most of us. This <lb/>
even tenor of her own way she reproduces with marvellous <lb/>
skill in the pages of her novels. It has been well said <lb/>
that "every village could furnish matter for a novel to <lb/>
Miss Austen." The material which she used is within the <lb/>
reach of every one; but she stands alone, hitherto quite <lb/>
unequalled, for the power of investing with charm and <lb/>
interest these incidents in the everyday life of everyday <lb/>
people which are the whole subject-matter of her six <lb/>
finished novels. A silly elopement on the part of one of <lb/>
the five Miss Bennets in <hi rend="italic">Pride and Prejudice,</hi> and the fall <lb/>
which stuns Louisa Musgrove in <hi rend="italic">Persuasion,</hi> when she <lb/>
insists on jumping off the cob at Lyme, are almost the <lb/>
<pb n="137" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0152"/>
only incidents in her books that can even be called <lb/>
unusual. Her novels remind us of pictures we sometimes <lb/>
see which contain no one object of supreme or <reg orig="extra-|ordinary">extraordinary</reg> <lb/>
loveliness, but which charm by showing us the <lb/>
beauty and interest in that which lies around us on every <lb/>
side. There is a picture by Frederick Walker, called "A <lb/>
Rainy Day," which is a very good instance of this; it is <lb/>
nothing but a village street just by a curve in the road; <lb/>
the houses are such as may be seen in half the villages in <lb/>
England: a dog goes along looking as dejected as dogs <lb/>
always do in the rain, the light is reflected in the puddles <lb/>
of the wet road, one foot-passenger only has ventured out. <lb/>
There is nothing in the picture but what we may all of us <lb/>
have seen hundreds and thousands of times, and yet one <lb/>
could look and look at it for hours and never weary of the <lb/>
charm of quiet, truthful beauty it contains. This is one <lb/>
of the things which true artists, whether their art is <reg orig="paint-|ing">painting</reg> <lb/>
pictures or writing books, can do for those who are <lb/>
not artists&mdash;that is, help them to see and feel the beauty <lb/>
and interest of the ordinary surroundings of everyday life. <lb/>
Robert Browning makes a great Italian painter say&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l rend="indent">We're made so that we love</l>
<l>First when we see them painted, things we have passed</l>
<l>Perhaps a hundred times nor cared to see;</l>
<l>And so they are better painted&mdash;better to us,</l>
<l>Which is the same thing. Art was given for that;</l>
<l>God uses us to help each other so,</l>
<l>Lending our minds out. Have you noticed, now,</l>
<l>Your cullion's hanging face? A bit of chalk,</l>
<l>And trust me, but you should, though! How much more</l>
<l>If I drew higher things with the same truth!</l>

 was a clergyman's daughter, born in <lb/>
1775 at the Vicarage of Steventon, about seven miles from <lb/>
<pb n="138" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0153"/>
Basingstoke, in Hampshire. Here she lived, for the first <lb/>
twenty-five years of her life, the quiet family life of most <lb/>
young ladies of similar circumstances; two of her brothers <lb/>
were in the Navy, one was a country gentleman, having <lb/>
inherited an estate from a cousin, another was a clergyman. <lb/>
The most dearly loved by Jane of all her family was her <lb/>
sister Cassandra, older than herself by three years. The <lb/>
sisters were so inseparable that when Cassandra went to <lb/>
school, Jane, though too young to profit much by the <lb/>
instruction given, was sent also, because it would have <lb/>
been cruel to separate the sisters; her mother said, "If <lb/>
Cassandra were going to have her head cut off, Jane <lb/>
would insist on sharing her fate." The devotion between <lb/>
the sisters was lifelong. Their characters were not much <lb/>
alike; Cassandra was colder, calmer, and more reserved <lb/>
than her sister, whose sweet temper and affectionate <reg orig="dis-|position">disposition</reg> <lb/>
specially endeared her to all her family; but Jane <lb/>
throughout her life relied upon Cassandra as one who was <lb/>
wiser and stronger than herself. The quiet family life at <lb/>
Steventon was diversified by one or two visits to Bath, <lb/>
then a very fashionable resort; a short visit to Lyme is <lb/>
spoken of later on; and in the early days in the vicarage <lb/>
the Austen children not infrequently amused themselves <lb/>
with private theatricals. Readers of <hi rend="italic">Northanger Abbey, <lb/>
Persuasion,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Mansfield Park</hi> will find these mild <reg orig="amuse-|ments">amusements</reg> <lb/>
woven into the web of the story; for, as Jane <lb/>
Austen says herself, she was like a bird who uses the odd <lb/>
bits of wool or moss in the hedgerows near to weave into <lb/>
the tiny fabric of its nest. The plays which the Austens <lb/>
acted were frequently written by themselves. This may <lb/>
probably have given to Jane her early impulse to <reg orig="author-|ship">authorship</reg>. <lb/>
It is not improbable that it also smoothed the way of <lb/>
her career as a writer in another sense; for at that time <lb/>
very great prejudice still existed in many people's minds <lb/>
against women who were writers. Lord Granville, <reg orig="speak-|ing">speaking</reg> <lb/>
in December 1887, at the unveiling of the statue of <lb/>
the Queen at Holloway College, cited a great French <lb/>
writer who had laid it down as an axiom that a woman <lb/>
<pb n="139" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0154"/>
could commit no greater fault than to be learned; the <lb/>
same writer had said&mdash;of course partly in joke&mdash;that it is <lb/>
enough knowledge for any woman if she is acquainted <lb/>
with the fact that Pekin is not in Europe, or that <reg orig="Alex-|ander">Alexander</reg> <lb/>
the Great was not the son-in-law of Louis the XIV. <lb/>
Referring to events within his own knowledge and <lb/>
memory, Lord Granville added, "One of the most eminent <lb/>
English statesmen of the century, a brilliant man of letters <lb/>
himself, after reading with admiration a beautiful piece of <lb/>
poetry written by his daughter, appealed to her affection <lb/>
for him to prevent her ever writing again, his fear was so <lb/>
great lest she should be thought a literary woman."</p>
<p>If a similar prejudice were in any degree felt by the <lb/>
Austen family, it is not unlikely that it was gradually <lb/>
dissolved by the early habit of the children of writing <lb/>
plays for home acting. We read, indeed, that Jane did <lb/>
nearly all her writing in the general sitting-room of the <lb/>
family, and that she was careful to keep her occupation <lb/>
secret from all but her own immediate relations. For this <lb/>
purpose she wrote on small pieces of paper, which could <lb/>
easily be put away, or covered by a piece of blotting-paper <lb/>
or needlework. The little mahogany desk at which she <lb/>
wrote is still preserved in the family. She never put her <lb/>
name on a title-page, but there is no evidence that her <lb/>
family would have disapproved of her doing so. They <lb/>
seem to have delighted in all she did, and to have helped <lb/>
her by every means in their power. She was a great <lb/>
favourite with her brothers and sister, and with all the <lb/>
tribe of nephews and nieces that grew up about her. She <lb/>
had no trace of any assumption of superiority, and gave <lb/>
herself no airs of any kind. She had too much humour <lb/>
and sense of fun for there to be any danger of this in <lb/>
her case. She was thoroughly womanly in her habits, <lb/>
manners, and occupations. Like Miss Martineau, her <lb/>
early training preserved her from being a literary lady <lb/>
who could not sew. Her needlework was remarkably fine <lb/>
and dainty, and specimens of it are still preserved which <lb/>
show that her fingers had the same deftness and skill as <lb/>
<pb n="140" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0155"/>
the mind which created Emma Woodhouse and her father, <lb/>
Mrs. Norris and Elizabeth Bennet. She had taken to <lb/>
authorship as a duck takes to water, and had written some <lb/>
of her most remarkable books before she was twenty; and <lb/>
she had done this so simply and naturally that she seems <lb/>
to have produced in her family the impression that writing <lb/>
first-rate novels was one of the easiest things in the world. <lb/>
We find, for instance, that she writes in 1814 many letters <lb/>
of advice to a novel-writing niece; and she advises <lb/>
another little niece to cease writing till she is sixteen years <lb/>
old, the child being at that time only ten or twelve. In <lb/>
1816 she addresses a very interesting letter to a nephew <lb/>
who is writing a novel, and has had the misfortune to lose <lb/>
two chapters and a half! She makes kindly fun of the <lb/>
young gentleman, and suggests that if she finds his lost <lb/>
treasure she shall engraft his chapters into her own novel; <lb/>
but she adds: "I do not think, however, that any theft <lb/>
of that sort would be really very useful to me. What <lb/>
should I do with your strong, manly, vigorous sketches, <lb/>
full of variety and glow? How could I possibly join them <lb/>
on to the little bit &lpar;two inches wide&rpar; of ivory on which I <lb/>
work with so fine a brush as produces little effect after <lb/>
much labour?"</p>
<p>Early in 1801 the home at Steventon was broken up. <lb/>
Mr. Austen resigned his living in consequence of failing <lb/>
health, and the family removed to Bath. Mr. Austen <lb/>
died in 1805, and Mrs. Austen and her daughters lived <lb/>
for a time at Southampton. They had no really <reg orig="home-|like">homelike</reg> <lb/>
home, however, between leaving Steventon in 1801 <lb/>
and settling at Chawton, in Hampshire, in 1809; and it <lb/>
is very characteristic of Jane Austen's home-loving nature <lb/>
that this homeless period was also a period of literary <lb/>
inactivity. She wrote <hi rend="italic">Sense and Sensibility, Northanger <lb/>
Abbey,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Pride and Prejudice</hi> before she left Steventon, <lb/>
though none of them were published till after she came to <lb/>
live at Chawton. Here in her second home she wrote <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Mansfield Park, Emma,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Persuasion</hi>. In consequence of <lb/>
having three novels finished before one was printed, when <lb/>
<pb n="141" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0156"/>
she once began to publish, her works appeared in rapid <lb/>
succession. <hi rend="italic">Sense and Sensibility</hi> was the first to appear, in <lb/>
1811, and the others followed quickly after one another, <lb/>
for her work was at once appreciated by the public, and <lb/>
the great leaders of the literary world, such as Sir Walter <lb/>
Scott, Southey, and Coleridge, welcomed her with cordial <lb/>
and generous praise. One curious little adventure should <lb/>
be mentioned. In 1803, during her residence at Bath, she <lb/>
had sold the manuscript of <hi rend="italic">Northanger Abbey</hi> to a Bath <lb/>
publisher for &pound;10. This good man, on reconsideration, <lb/>
evidently thought he had made a bad bargain, and resolved <lb/>
to lose his ten pounds rather than risk a larger sum in <lb/>
printing and publishing the book. The manuscript <reg orig="there-|fore">therefore</reg> <lb/>
lay on his shelves for many years quite forgotten. <lb/>
But the time came when <hi rend="italic">Sense and Sensibility, Pride and <lb/>
Prejudice,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Mansfield Park</hi> had placed their author in <lb/>
the first rank of English writers, and it occurred to Miss <lb/>
Austen and her family that it might be well to rescue <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Northanger Abbey</hi> from its unappreciative possessor. One <lb/>
of her brothers called on the Bath publisher and negotiated <lb/>
with him the re-purchase of the manuscript, giving for it <lb/>
the same sum which had been paid to the author about <lb/>
ten years earlier. The publisher was delighted to get <lb/>
back his &pound;10, which he had never expected to see again, <lb/>
and Jane Austen's brother was delighted to get back the <lb/>
manuscript. Both parties to the bargain were fully <lb/>
satisfied; but the poor publisher's feelings would have <lb/>
been very different if he had known that the neglected <lb/>
manuscript, with which he had so joyfully parted, was by <lb/>
the author of the most successful novels of the day.</p>
<p>There is a quiet vein of fun and humorous observation <lb/>
running through all Miss Austen's writings. It is as <lb/>
visible in her private letters to her friends as in her works <lb/>
intended for publication. The little turns of expression <lb/>
are not reproduced, but the humour of the one is very <lb/>
similar to that of the other. Thus, for instance, in one <lb/>
of her letters she describes a visit to a young lady at <lb/>
school in London. Jane Austen had left her a raw <reg orig="school-|girl">schoolgirl</reg>, <lb/>
<pb n="142" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0157"/>
and found her, on this visit, developed into a <reg orig="fashion-|able">fashionable</reg> <lb/>
young lady. "Her hair," writes Jane to Cassandra, <lb/>
"is done up with an elegance to do credit to any <reg orig="educa-|tion">education</reg>." <lb/>
Who can read this without thinking of Fanny <lb/>
Price in <hi rend="italic">Mansfield Park,</hi> and the inevitable contempt she <lb/>
inspired in her fashionable cousins because she did not <lb/>
know French and had but one sash?</p>
<p>Reference has already been made to the high <reg orig="apprecia-|tion">appreciation</reg> <lb/>
of Miss Austen's genius which has been expressed by <lb/>
the highest literary authorities in her own time and in <lb/>
ours. Sir Walter Scott wrote in his journal: "I have <lb/>
read again, and for the third time, Miss Austen's very <lb/>
finely-written novel of <hi rend="italic">Pride and Prejudice</hi>. That young <lb/>
lady has a talent for describing the involvements and <lb/>
feelings and characters of ordinary life, which is to me the <lb/>
most wonderful I ever met with. The big Bow-Wow <lb/>
strain I can do myself like any now going, but the <lb/>
exquisite touch which renders commonplace things and <lb/>
characters interesting from the truth of the descriptive <lb/>
and the sentiment is denied to me." Lord Macaulay, the <lb/>
great historian, wrote in his diary: "Read Dickens's <hi rend="italic">Hard <lb/>
Times,</hi> and another book of Pliny's <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi>. Read <hi rend="italic"><reg orig="North-|anger">Northanger</reg> <lb/>
Abbey,</hi> worth all Dickens and Pliny put together. <lb/>
Yet it was the work of a girl. She was certainly not <lb/>
more than twenty-six. Wonderful creature!" Guizot, <lb/>
the French historian, was a great novel reader, and he <lb/>
delighted in English novels, especially those written by <lb/>
women. Referring to the women writers of the beginning <lb/>
of this century, of whom Miss Austen was the chief, he said <lb/>
that their works "form a school which, in the excellence <lb/>
and profusion of its productions, resembles the cloud of <lb/>
dramatic authors of the great Athenian age." The late <lb/>
Mr. G. H. Lewes said he would rather have written <hi rend="italic">Pride <lb/>
and Prejudice</hi> than any of the Waverley novels. George <lb/>
Eliot calls Jane Austen the greatest artist that has ever <lb/>
written, "using the term 'artist' to signify the most <lb/>
perfect master over the means to her end." It is perhaps <lb/>
only fair to state that some good judges do not entertain <lb/>
<pb n="143" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0158"/>
so high an opinion of her work. Madame de Sta&euml;l <reg orig="pro-|nounced">pronounced</reg> <lb/>
against her, using the singularly inappropriate <lb/>
word "vulgar," in condemnation of her work. If there is <lb/>
a writer in the world free from vulgarity in its ordinary <lb/>
sense, it is Jane Austen; it must be supposed that <lb/>
Madame de Sta&euml;l used the word in its French sense, <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> <lb/>
"commonplace" or "ordinary," such a meaning of the <lb/>
word as is retained in our English expression "the vulgar <lb/>
tongue." Charlotte Bront&euml; felt in Miss Austen a <reg orig="defici-|ency">deficiency</reg> <lb/>
in poetic imagination, in the high tone of sentiment <lb/>
which elevates the prose of everyday life into poetry. She <lb/>
found her "shrewd and observant rather than sagacious <lb/>
and profound." Miss Austen's writings were so essentially <lb/>
different from the highly imaginative work of her sister <lb/>
author, that it is not surprising that the younger failed <lb/>
somewhat in appreciation of the elder writer.</p>
<p>Jane Austen's failing health in 1816 caused much <lb/>
anxiety to her family. It is characteristic of her gentle <lb/>
thoughtfulness for all about her that she never could be <lb/>
induced to use the one sofa with which the family <reg orig="sitting-|room">sitting-room</reg> <lb/>
was provided. Her mother, who was more than <lb/>
seventy years old, often used the sofa, and Jane would <lb/>
never occupy it, even in her mother's absence, preferring <lb/>
to contrive for herself a sort of couch formed with two or <lb/>
three chairs. A little niece, puzzled that "Aunt Jane" <lb/>
preferred this arrangement, drew from her the explanation <lb/>
that if she used the sofa in her mother's absence, Mrs. <lb/>
Austen would probably abstain from using it as much as <lb/>
was good for her. Her last book, <hi rend="italic">Persuasion,</hi> was finished <lb/>
while she was suffering very much from what proved to be <lb/>
her dying illness. Weak health did not in any way <lb/>
diminish her industry, and she exacted from herself the <lb/>
utmost perfection that she felt she was capable of giving <lb/>
to her work. The last chapters of <hi rend="italic">Persuasion</hi> were <lb/>
cancelled and re-written because her first conclusion of <lb/>
the story did not satisfy her. In May 1817 she and <lb/>
her sister removed to Winchester in order that Jane might <lb/>
have skilled medical advice. Here she died on 18th July <lb/>
<pb n="144" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0159"/>
and was buried opposite Wykeham's Chantry, in the <lb/>
cathedral. Her sweetness of temper and her gentle gaiety <lb/>
never failed her throughout a long and trying illness. <lb/>
When the end was near, one of those with her asked if <lb/>
there was anything she wanted; her reply was, <hi rend="italic">"Nothing <lb/>
but death."</hi></p>

MARIA EDGEWORTH</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">It</hi> will be impossible, in the short limits of these pages, to <lb/>
give anything like a full account of the long life of Maria <lb/>
Edgeworth. She lived for nearly eighty-three years, from <lb/>
1st January 1767 to 22d May 1849; and through her <lb/>
own and her father's friends she was brought into touch <lb/>
with nearly all the leading men and women connected with <lb/>
the stirring political and literary events of that period. <lb/>
What this implies will be best realised if we consider that <lb/>
her lifetime comprised the whole period of the French <lb/>
Revolution, the War of Independence in the United States, <lb/>
the long wars of England with Napoleon, the landing of <lb/>
the French in Ireland &lpar;her native country&rpar;, the passing of <lb/>
the Act of Union between England and Ireland, Catholic <lb/>
Emancipation, the Abolition of Slavery in the British <lb/>
Dominions, the passing of the first Reform Bill, the Irish <lb/>
Famine of 1847, and the outbreak of revolutionary socialism <lb/>
on the Continent in 1848. These are some of the most <lb/>
burning of the political events of which she was a witness; <lb/>
the literary and social history of the same period is hardly <lb/>
less remarkable. She lived in the centre of a world made <lb/>
brilliant by Wordsworth, Coleridge, Shelley, Byron, Burns, <lb/>
Keats, Scott, and Jane Austen. She knew Mrs. Fry, <lb/>
Wilberforce, and Sydney Smith, as representing some of <lb/>
the most important of the social movements of her time; <lb/>
<pb n="146" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0161"/>
among her friends in the scientific world were Ricardo, the <lb/>
political economist, Darwin, the naturalist, whose fame has <lb/>
been overshadowed by that of his grandson, the great <lb/>
Charles Darwin of our own times, Sir Humphry Davy, the <lb/>
Herschels, Mrs. Somerville, and James Mill. She knew <lb/>
Mrs. Siddons, and heard her recite in her own house the <lb/>
part of Queen Katherine in the play of <hi rend="italic">Henry the Eighth</hi>. <lb/>
She was the intimate friend, and connection by marriage, <lb/>
of "Kitty Pakenham," the first Duchess of Wellington, <lb/>
wife of "the Great Duke." She lived to see the old stage <lb/>
coaches supplanted by our modern railways; she was the <lb/>
interested eye-witness of the gradual introduction of the <lb/>
steam-engine into all departments of industry, a change <lb/>
which Sir Walter Scott said he looked on "half proud, half <lb/>
sad, half angry, and half pleased." She might well feel, as <lb/>
old age approached, that she had "warmed both hands at <lb/>
the fire of life." No life could have been fuller than hers <lb/>
of every sort of interest and activity. She said in a letter <lb/>
to a friend, written after a dangerous illness: "When I <lb/>
felt it was more than probable that I should not recover, <lb/>
with a pulse above 120, and at the entrance of my <reg orig="seventy-|sixth">seventy-sixth</reg> <lb/>
year, I was not alarmed. I felt ready to rise tranquil <lb/>
from the banquet of life, where I had been a happy guest. <lb/>
I confidently relied on the goodness of my Creator" &lpar;<hi rend="italic">Study <lb/>
of Maria Edgeworth,</hi> by Grace A. Oliver, p. 521&rpar;.</p>
<p>Maria Edgeworth's family was one of English origin, <lb/>
which had settled in Ireland in the reign of Queen Elizabeth. <lb/>
The Edgeworths intermarried into Irish, Welsh, and English <lb/>
families, but always maintained strong Irish sympathies.</p>
<p>There were many remarkable men and women in the <lb/>
Edgeworth family before the birth of our heroine, but space <lb/>
forbids the mention of more than one, her father, Richard <lb/>
Lovell Edgeworth, whose name and fame are intimately <lb/>
associated with those of his daughter. Mr. Edgeworth was <lb/>
a most extraordinary man; at one moment one admires <lb/>
him, at another one laughs at him, but one must always be <lb/>
astonished by him. "To put a girdle round about the <lb/>
earth in forty minutes" would have been a congenial task <lb/>
<pb n="147" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0162"/>
to him. He made clocks, built bridges, raised spires, <lb/>
invented telegraphs, manufactured balloons, ink, and soap, <lb/>
constructed locks on his bedroom doors of such a complicated <lb/>
nature, that his guests were afraid to shut their doors lest <lb/>
they never should be able to open them again.</p>
<p>When on a journey in France about 1770, he stayed at <lb/>
Lyons, and carried out a plan for diverting the Rhone from <lb/>
its course, thereby saving a large tract of country that had <lb/>
previously been inaccessible; for this service the city of <lb/>
Lyons rewarded him by a grant of land; this property, <lb/>
however, was confiscated a few years later during the <lb/>
Revolution.</p>
<p>He raised a corps of volunteer infantry in Ireland, to <lb/>
which Roman Catholics as well as Protestants were admitted, <lb/>
although at that time the sentiment of religious equality <lb/>
was regarded as akin to infidelity and disloyalty. He was <lb/>
born in England, and educated partly here and partly in <lb/>
Ireland; like most of the Edgeworths, he came of a mixed <lb/>
race, his mother being a Welsh woman of considerable <lb/>
literary acquirements and faculties; his first remarkable <lb/>
performance was a runaway marriage, which he contracted <lb/>
at the age of nineteen, with a Miss Elers, a lady of German <lb/>
origin, whom he appears rather to have disliked than <lb/>
otherwise. A runaway marriage with a girl whom he <lb/>
really loved would have been too commonplace a proceeding <lb/>
in those days for this eccentric young gentleman. Speaking <lb/>
of this lady, Mr. Edgeworth wrote: "My wife was prudent, <lb/>
domestic, and affectionate, but she was not of a cheerful <lb/>
temper. She lamented about trifles; and the lamenting of <lb/>
a female, with whom we live, does not render home <reg orig="de-|lightful">delightful</reg>." <lb/>
It is not recorded if Mrs. Edgeworth found the <lb/>
lamenting of the male with whom she lived any more <lb/>
delightful, nor indeed is it evident that her husband devoted <lb/>
much of his overflowing energy to lamentation. As he <lb/>
did not find his home delightful, he spent very little time <lb/>
in it, and was not long before he found pleasant society <lb/>
elsewhere.</p>
<p>One can never think of Mr. Edgeworth apart from his <lb/>
<pb n="148" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0163"/>
extraordinary domestic history. He had four wives, one <lb/>
after another, in rapid succession, and twenty-two children. <lb/>
There were four children, of whom Maria was one, by the <lb/>
first marriage with the "lamenting female." The eldest of <lb/>
these, born when his father was under twenty, was brought <lb/>
up on the principles advocated by Rousseau, which may <lb/>
perhaps be summarised as never forcing a child to do <reg orig="any-|thing">anything</reg> <lb/>
that he does not wish to do. One experiment of <lb/>
this kind appears to have sufficed for the family; the other <lb/>
twenty-one children, or such of them as survived infancy, <lb/>
were treated according to other theories. Indeed, it seems <lb/>
to have been part of Maria's education that she was to <lb/>
undertake, for a part of every day, some study or occupation <lb/>
that was uncongenial to her. Mr. Edgeworth's theories of <lb/>
education seem to have been almost as numerous as his <lb/>
family; a story is told in the book already quoted, of the <lb/>
visit of a gentleman to Edgeworthstown House in Ireland; <lb/>
on rejoining the ladies after dinner, the guest was imprudent <lb/>
enough to exclaim on the beauty of the golden hair of one <lb/>
of the younger girls. Mr. Edgeworth instantly took his <lb/>
daughter by the hand, walked across the room, opened a <lb/>
drawer, held her head over it, and with a large pair of <lb/>
scissors cut off all her hair close to her head. "As the <lb/>
golden ringlets fell into the drawer, this extraordinary <lb/>
father said, 'Charlotte, what do you say?' She answered, <lb/>
'Thank you, father.' Turning to his guests, he remarked, <lb/>
'I will not allow a daughter of mine to be vain.'"</p>
<p>Among the friendships that had a powerful influence on <lb/>
Mr. Edgeworth's character must be mentioned that with <lb/>
Mr. Day, the author of a book which is still well known, <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Sandford and Merton</hi>. Mr. Day was an even more <reg orig="extra-|ordinary">extraordinary</reg> <lb/>
man than Mr. Edgeworth. He entirely set at <lb/>
naught all the usual habits of society; we are told that <lb/>
he "seldom combed his raven locks." He professed to <lb/>
think love had been the greatest curse to mankind, and <lb/>
announced in season and out of season his determination <lb/>
never to marry. It appears that the assistance of a great <lb/>
many ladies was needed to help him for a time to keep his <lb/>
<pb n="149" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0164"/>
word. He made offers of marriage to Margaret Edgeworth, <lb/>
his friend's sister, to Honora and Elizabeth Sneyd &lpar;who <lb/>
became later the second and third wives of Mr. Edgeworth&rpar;; <lb/>
and failing to induce any of these ladies to accept him, he <lb/>
adopted two orphan girls from the Foundling with the <lb/>
object of educating one of them to such a pitch of perfection <lb/>
that she should be fit to be his wife. In order to foster <lb/>
the quality of "fortitude in females," he used to drop hot <lb/>
sealing-wax on their bare arms, and fire off pistols, charged <lb/>
with powder only, at their petticoats. One of the two <lb/>
little girls could never entirely overcome the tendency to <lb/>
make use of some vehement expression of pain or alarm <lb/>
under these circumstances. This Mr. Day considered a <lb/>
fatal disqualification for ever promoting her to be his wife. <lb/>
The other, to whom the romantic name of Sabrina Sydney <lb/>
had been given, was more promising, and at one time it <lb/>
seemed as if the perilous honour of being Mrs. Day would <lb/>
be hers. However, she was saved by her disobedience to <lb/>
his injunctions against wearing a particular kind of sleeve <lb/>
and handkerchief which were then in fashion. Upon this <lb/>
piece of self-will, we are told that "he at once and decidedly <lb/>
gave her up."</p>
<p>Mr. Day's proposals to Honora and Elizabeth Sneyd, <lb/>
two beautiful sisters with whom he and Mr. Edgeworth <lb/>
were brought much in contact at Lichfield, have been <lb/>
already mentioned. Mr. Day pretended to despise beauty <lb/>
and to condemn love; but Honora's beauty so far overcame <lb/>
his prejudices that he at least professed love for her. His <lb/>
offer of marriage, however, was more like an ultimatum of <lb/>
war than an expression of affection. He sent her a huge <lb/>
packet, in which he detailed all the conditions he should <lb/>
expect her to fulfil if she married him. One of these was <lb/>
entire seclusion from all society but his own. She replied <lb/>
that she "would not admit the unqualified control of a <lb/>
husband over all her actions: she did not feel that seclusion <lb/>
from society was indispensably necessary to preserve female <lb/>
virtue, or to secure domestic happiness. And she declined <lb/>
leaving her mode of life for any 'dark and untried system.'" <lb/>
<pb n="150" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0165"/>
Mr. Day was deeply wounded, but it was his vanity that <lb/>
suffered rather than his heart; for in three weeks he made <lb/>
a similar overture to Honora's sister, Elizabeth. Now, <lb/>
however, the tables were turned. Whether the sisters <lb/>
conspired together to punish him is not known; but <lb/>
Elizabeth imposed conditions on her lover before she would <lb/>
consent to receive his attentions; she declared she could <lb/>
never marry a man who could neither fence, dance, nor <lb/>
ride, and had none of the accomplishments of a gentleman. <lb/>
These were the very qualities Mr. Day had chiefly exercised <lb/>
his philosophy in deriding and denouncing. "How could <lb/>
he," cried Miss Elizabeth, with cruel logic, "with propriety <lb/>
abuse and ridicule talents in which he appeared deficient?" <lb/>
Mr. Day therefore repaired to France with Mr. Edgeworth <lb/>
in order to acquire those polite accomplishments of which <lb/>
it had been the pride of his heart to know nothing. Poor <lb/>
Mr. Day! <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>How many a month I strove to suit</l>
<l>These stubborn fingers to the lute!</l>
<l>To-day I venture all I know.</l>
<l>She will not hear my music? So!</l>
<l>Break the string; fold music's wing:</l>
<l>Suppose Pauline had bade me sing.</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>When he came back from France, cruel Elizabeth laughed <lb/>
in his face, and said she had liked him best as he was before. <lb/>
Notwithstanding all these unsuccessful attempts, Mr. Day <lb/>
found a wife at length. She was a lady of large fortune, <lb/>
which, of course, he "despised" and appropriated. She <lb/>
conformed to all her husband's whims, and honestly believed <lb/>
him to be the best and most distinguished of men. "That's <lb/>
what a man wants in a wife mostly," as Mrs. Poyser says; <lb/>
"one who'd pretend she didn't know which end she stood <lb/>
uppermost till her husband told her." Mr. Day fell a <lb/>
victim at last to one of his numerous theories. He <reg orig="dis-|approved">disapproved</reg> <lb/>
of the professional method of breaking in colts, <lb/>
and undertook to train one upon an improved plan of his <lb/>
own. The animal plunged violently and threw him; he <lb/>
had concussion of the brain, and died a few minutes after <lb/>
<pb n="151" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0166"/>
his fall. Poor Mrs. Day was so inconsolable that she took <lb/>
to her bed, and died two years later. She must have been <lb/>
a woman of the type of Milton's Eve: "Herself, though <lb/>
fairest, unsupported flower." When her prop was gone, <lb/>
she drooped and died.</p>
<p>During Mr. Edgeworth's residence at Lyons his first <lb/>
wife, Maria's mother, died, and in a few months he married <lb/>
the beautiful Honora Sneyd. The social circle at Lichfield, <lb/>
in which Honora had lived before her marriage, contained <lb/>
many distinguished persons, among them Dr. Darwin, and <lb/>
Miss Anna Seward, the poetess. Honora herself had been <lb/>
engaged, or partly engaged, to Major Andr&eacute;, the unfortunate <lb/>
officer whose execution as a spy by the Americans, during <lb/>
the War of Independence, caused such deep indignation in <lb/>
England. Her marriage to Mr. Edgeworth in 1773, and <lb/>
her death in 1780, took place before the melancholy end <lb/>
of Major Andr&eacute;'s life. The association of Honora's name <lb/>
with that of Major Andr&eacute; is mentioned here as an <reg orig="illustra-|tion">illustration</reg> <lb/>
of the way in which the Edgeworth family were <lb/>
connected, in some form or another, with many of the most <lb/>
interesting events of the times in which they lived. <lb/>
Another such incident is to be found in the fact that the <lb/>
Abb&eacute; Edgeworth, a relative who had become a Roman <lb/>
Catholic priest, and had lived many years in France, <lb/>
attended Louis XVI upon the scaffold, and received his <lb/>
last words.</p>
<p>Of the charm and goodness of the beautiful Honora there <lb/>
can be no doubt. She won all hearts. Her little <reg orig="step-|daughter">step-daughter</reg>, <lb/>
Maria, loved her dearly, and admired her as <lb/>
much as she loved her. She remembered, in after years, <lb/>
standing at her step-mother's dressing-table and looking up <lb/>
at her with a sudden thought, "How beautiful!" The <lb/>
second Mrs. Edgeworth became, under her husband's <lb/>
tuition, a very good mechanic; and together they wrote a <lb/>
little book for children, called <hi rend="italic">Harry and Lucy</hi>. Very <lb/>
few books for children had at that time been written, so <lb/>
that they were very early in a field which has since found <lb/>
so many labourers. Mrs. Honora discerned Maria's <reg orig="remark-|able">remarkable</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="152" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0167"/>
qualities of mind. When the latter was only twelve <lb/>
years old her step-mother wrote to her expressing the <lb/>
pleasure she felt in being able to treat the young girl "as <lb/>
her equal in every respect but age." Mr. Edgeworth, too, <lb/>
fully appreciated and studiously cultivated Maria's gifts, <lb/>
and encouraged her in every way to treat him with <reg orig="open-|ness">openness</reg> <lb/>
and familiarity. This conduct was a very great contrast <lb/>
with the extreme stiffness and formality which then <reg orig="pre-|vailed">prevailed</reg> <lb/>
generally between parents and children. It was <lb/>
near this time, but a little later, that the well-known writer, <lb/>
William Godwin, was reproached by his mother with his <lb/>
too great formality in addressing her; he had been <lb/>
accustomed to speak and write to her as "Madam," and <lb/>
she says in one of her letters to him that "Hon'd Mother" <lb/>
"would be full as agreeable." Therefore the terms of <lb/>
friendly familiarity and equality between Maria and her <lb/>
parents were the more remarkable. The happiness of Mr. <lb/>
Edgeworth's second marriage was unclouded, except by the <lb/>
symptoms of consumption in Honora, which warned them <lb/>
that an inevitable parting was at hand. She died in May <lb/>
1780, when Maria was thirteen years old. By his dead <lb/>
wife's side, Mr. Edgeworth wrote to Maria impressing upon <lb/>
her all the hopes that he and her step-mother had formed <lb/>
for her future. Very soon after he wrote again and bade her <lb/>
write a short story on the subject of generosity; "It must <lb/>
be taken," he wrote, "from History or Romance, and must <lb/>
be sent the sennight after you receive this; and I beg that <lb/>
you will take some pains about it." The story, when <lb/>
finished, was submitted to the judgment of Mr. William <lb/>
Sneyd, Honora's brother, who said of it, "An excellent <lb/>
story, and extremely well written; but where is the <lb/>
generosity?"&mdash;a saying which afterwards became a <reg orig="house-|hold">household</reg> <lb/>
word with the Edgeworths.</p>
<p>When Honora was dying she had solemnly begged her <lb/>
husband and her sister Elizabeth to marry each other after <lb/>
her own death. Such marriages at that time were not <lb/>
illegal, and eight months after Honora's death her sister <lb/>
and Mr. Edgeworth were married in St. Andrew's Church, <lb/>
<pb n="153" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0168"/>
Holborn. Not long after this the first really important <lb/>
event of Maria's life took place, when she went with her <lb/>
father and the rest of his family to take up her residence in <lb/>
her Irish home. At the impressionable age of fifteen, <lb/>
after having lived long enough in England to judge of the <lb/>
differences between the two countries, she was introduced <lb/>
to an intimate acquaintance with rural life in Ireland. <lb/>
Her father employed no agent for the management of his <lb/>
property, but invited and expected Maria to help him in all <lb/>
his business. In this way she acquired a thorough insight <lb/>
into the charm, the weakness and the strength, the humour <lb/>
and the melancholy of the Irish character.</p>
<p>From 1782, when Mr. Edgeworth and his family <lb/>
returned to live at their Irish home, dates not only Maria <lb/>
Edgeworth's close observation of Irish character and customs, <lb/>
but also the very painstaking literary training which she <lb/>
began to receive from her father. Up to this time Maria <lb/>
had been much at school; owing to the delicate health of <lb/>
her first step-mother, it was considered best that her <reg orig="educa-|tion">education</reg> <lb/>
should be mainly carried on elsewhere than at home. <lb/>
Now, however, Mr. Edgeworth divided his time between <lb/>
the management of his estates and the education of his <lb/>
children, and to Maria's literary education in particular he <lb/>
devoted himself with singular zeal and assiduity. She was <lb/>
continually practised by him in systematic observing and <lb/>
writing; she was instructed to prepare stories in outline. <lb/>
"None of your drapery," her father would say; "I can <lb/>
imagine all that. Let me see the bare skeleton." At this <lb/>
stage her compositions would be altered, revised, and <lb/>
amended by him, and then returned to her for completion.</p>
<p>There is no doubt whatever of the immense pains which <lb/>
Mr. Edgeworth bestowed upon Maria's literary training; <lb/>
and Maria herself felt that she owed everything to him. <lb/>
It may, however, very well be doubted whether his <lb/>
influence upon her was good from the literary point of view. <lb/>
He gave her method and system, and he cultivated her <lb/>
natural faculties for observation; but there was something <lb/>
very mechanical and pedantic in his mind&mdash;an affectation, <lb/>
<pb n="154" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0169"/>
a want of humour, and a want of spontaneity: she, when <lb/>
left to herself, was content with grouping the facts of life <lb/>
and nature as she saw them around her, without trying <lb/>
to be more instructive than they are. <hi rend="italic">Castle Rackrent,</hi> <lb/>
which is the best of her Irish stories, was entirely her own, <lb/>
and bears no traces of her father's hand. This is the only <lb/>
one of her tales of which she did not draw out a preliminary <lb/>
sketch or framework for her father's criticism. She says <lb/>
herself of this story, "A curious fact, that where I least <lb/>
aimed at drawing characters I succeeded best. As far as <lb/>
I have heard, the characters in <hi rend="italic">Castle Rackrent</hi> were, in <lb/>
their day, considered as better classes of Irish characters <lb/>
than any I ever drew; they cost me no trouble, and were <lb/>
made by no <hi rend="italic">receipt,</hi> or thought of philosophical classification; <lb/>
there was literally not a correction, not an alteration, made <lb/>
in the first writing, no copy, and, as I recollect, no <reg orig="inter-|lineation">interlineation</reg>; <lb/>
it went to the press just as it was written. <lb/>
Other stories I have corrected with the greatest care, and <lb/>
remodelled and re-written." If she had given the world <lb/>
more work of this kind, and less of the kind produced under <lb/>
her father's methods, her name would to-day occupy a <lb/>
higher place than it does in the hierarchy of literature.</p>
<p>Maria Edgeworth may be said to have invented the <lb/>
modern novel, which gives the traits, the speech, the <lb/>
manners, and the thoughts of a peasantry instead of moving <lb/>
only among the upper ten thousand. Sir Walter Scott, <lb/>
with his usual frankness and generosity, stated in his <reg orig="pre-|face">preface</reg> <lb/>
to the Waverley Novels that what really started him <lb/>
in his career as a novelist was the desire to do for Scotland <lb/>
and the Scottish peasantry what Miss Edgeworth had done <lb/>
for Ireland and the Irish peasantry. "I felt," he said, <lb/>
"that something might be attempted for my own country <lb/>
of the same kind with that which Miss Edgeworth so <lb/>
fortunately achieved for Ireland&mdash;something which might <lb/>
introduce her natives to those of the sister kingdom in a <lb/>
more favourable light than they had been placed hitherto, <lb/>
and to tend to procure sympathy for their virtues and <lb/>
indulgence for their foibles." Another of the leading <lb/>
<pb n="155" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0170"/>
writers of this century has acknowledged his indebtedness <lb/>
to Miss Edgeworth. The great Russian novelist, Ivan <lb/>
Tourgenieff, told a friend that when he was quite young <lb/>
he was unacquainted with the English language, but he <lb/>
used to hear his elder brother reading out to his friends <lb/>
translations of Miss Edgeworth's Irish stories, and the hope <lb/>
rose in his mind that one day he would be able to do for <lb/>
Russia and her people what Miss Edgeworth had done for <lb/>
Ireland.</p>
<p>Readers of the life of Maria Edgeworth find plenty of <lb/>
evidence of the extremely disturbed state of Ireland during <lb/>
the ten or twelve years which immediately preceded the <lb/>
passing of the Act of Union in 1800. Reports of midnight <lb/>
outrages by armed and disguised bands of assassins were <lb/>
frequent; unpopular people were hooted and pelted by day, <lb/>
and sometimes murdered by night; country houses were <lb/>
provided with shutters so contrived as to make it possible <lb/>
to open a cross-fire upon these murderous bands in case <lb/>
of necessity. The "Thrashers" and the "Whitetooths" <lb/>
were the names then assumed by those marauders who in <lb/>
later times have been known as Whiteboys and <reg orig="Moon-|lighters">Moonlighters</reg>. <lb/>
The state of Ireland, politically and socially, <lb/>
became so critical that many people began to feel that <lb/>
almost any change must be for the better. Added to all <lb/>
the other elements of confusion, there was, about 1798, the <lb/>
almost daily expectation of the French invasion. England <lb/>
and France were at war, and it was believed by our <lb/>
enemies that if they could once effect a landing in Ireland <lb/>
the people of that island were so ready for rebellion that <lb/>
the landing of the French would be in itself almost enough <lb/>
to place the whole country at their disposal. In this <lb/>
expectation they were, fortunately, very much deceived. <lb/>
A graphic description of the French invasion, and its utter <lb/>
failure to accomplish its purpose, has been given by Miss <lb/>
Edgeworth. Her family had, indeed, a very close <lb/>
acquaintance with the rebels and the invaders. The <lb/>
county in which Edgeworthstown was situated was in <lb/>
actual insurrection, and when the French landed at Killala, <lb/>
<pb n="156" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0171"/>
in county Mayo, they marched immediately upon Longford, <lb/>
which was in close proximity to Edgeworthstown.</p>
<p>Mr. Edgeworth sent to the nearest garrison for military <lb/>
protection for his household. He also found the majority <lb/>
of the troop of infantry which he had organised faithful <lb/>
to him; but it soon became evident, in spite of this and of <lb/>
the personal fidelity of his servants and tenants, that the <lb/>
house must be abandoned, and that the whole family must <lb/>
take refuge in the town of Longford. There is something <lb/>
rather amusing as well as touching in Maria's womanly <lb/>
regrets at leaving her new paint and paper to the mercy of <lb/>
the rebels and the French. "My father," she wrote, "has <lb/>
made our little rooms so nice for us; they are all fresh <lb/>
painted and papered. O rebels! O French! spare them! <lb/>
We have never injured you, and all we wish is to see <reg orig="every-|body">everybody</reg> <lb/>
as happy as ourselves." After the family and <reg orig="house-|hold">household</reg> <lb/>
had made good their departure from Edgeworthstown, <lb/>
Mr. Edgeworth remembered that he had left, on the table <lb/>
of his study, a list of the names of the men serving in his <lb/>
corps, on whose fidelity he could depend. If this list fell <lb/>
into the hands of the enemy, the men whose names were <lb/>
upon it would probably be selected for bitter and cruel <lb/>
vengeance. "It would serve," wrote Miss Edgeworth, "to <lb/>
point out their houses for pillage and their families for <reg orig="de-|struction">destruction</reg>. <lb/>
My father turned his horse instantly, and galloped <lb/>
back. The time of his absence appeared immeasurably long, <lb/>
but he returned safely, after having destroyed the <reg orig="danger-|ous">dangerous</reg> <lb/>
paper." Even if Mr. Edgeworth did spoil Maria's <lb/>
romances, he must be forgiven for the sake of this act of <lb/>
unselfish gallantry. When the family arrived in safety at <lb/>
Longford, dangers began to arise from another source. It <lb/>
was discovered in the course of a few days that <reg orig="Edgeworth-|stown">Edgeworthstown</reg> <lb/>
House had been left by the rebels entirely uninjured. <lb/>
The corps of infantry which Mr. Edgeworth had brought <lb/>
with him into Longford consisted partly of Catholics. Mr. <lb/>
Edgeworth entertained and defended with vigour a plan <lb/>
for the defence of the town different from that favoured by <lb/>
other persons in authority. All these circumstances were <lb/>
<pb n="157" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0172"/>
put together with the speed of wild-fire, and created in the <lb/>
minds of the ultra-Protestants of Longford the conviction <lb/>
that Mr. Edgeworth was in secret league with the rebels; <lb/>
this, they were convinced, was the reason why his house <lb/>
had been spared, why he had admitted Papists into any of <lb/>
the bonds of good fellowship; and his plan for the defence <lb/>
of the gaol and the garrison was, they believed, only a trick <lb/>
for making them over into the enemy's hands. Two <lb/>
farthing candles, by the light of which Mr. Edgeworth had <lb/>
read the paper the previous evening, near the fortifications <lb/>
of the gaol, were speedily exaggerated into a statement that <lb/>
the gaol had been illuminated as a signal to the enemy. <lb/>
An armed mob assembled, fully determined to tear him to <lb/>
pieces. He escaped through the merest accident. Seeing <lb/>
him accompanied by English officers in uniform, his enemies <lb/>
thought he was being brought back a prisoner, and were <lb/>
for the moment satisfied. The incident is illustrative of <lb/>
the conflicting passions which, for so many years, have <lb/>
formed the great social and political difficulty in Ireland.</p>
<p>The rebels and their French allies were defeated at the <lb/>
battle of Ballynamuck, and the quiet family life at <reg orig="Edge-|worthstown">Edgeworthstown</reg> <lb/>
was resumed. All through the turmoil of <lb/>
wars and rumours of wars, the even tenor of Maria's way <lb/>
was very little disturbed. "I am going on in the old <lb/>
way," she wrote, "writing stories. I cannot be a captain <lb/>
of dragoons, and sitting with my hands before me would <lb/>
not make any of us one degree safer."</p>
<p>Maria and her father had published their joint book, <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Practical Education,</hi> in the very year &lpar;1798&rpar; of the exciting <lb/>
events just narrated. Elizabeth, the second step-mother, <lb/>
also had a hand in it; to her notes, we are told, may be <lb/>
traced the chapter on "Obedience." In this chapter the <lb/>
original view is put forward that in order to form and <lb/>
firmly implant in little children the habit of obedience, <lb/>
their parents should be careful at first only to tell them to <lb/>
do what they like doing. The habit of unquestioning <lb/>
obedience thus formed will, it is thought, be sufficiently <lb/>
strong to bear the strain, when the time comes that the <lb/>
<pb n="158" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0173"/>
child is told to do things which it would rather not do. <lb/>
There is a considerable element of good sense in this <lb/>
method, as most people will agree who have tried it in <lb/>
the training and teaching of dogs. A much more <reg orig="doubt-|ful">doubtful</reg> <lb/>
theory put forward in the book is that children never <lb/>
should be in the society of servants. This appears to us, <lb/>
in these more democratic days, to savour very much of <lb/>
pride and conceit. It is quite true that parents cannot <lb/>
depute to a hired servant, however faithful, the <reg orig="responsi-|bility">responsibility</reg> <lb/>
of their own position. But to say that a child is on <lb/>
no account to speak to a servant, or to be spoken to by <lb/>
one, appears to us now as most unreasonable and <reg orig="mis-|chievous">mischievous</reg>. <lb/>
How valuable in bridging over the gulf that <lb/>
still separates class from class is the warm affection that <lb/>
often exists between children and their nurses! Many a <lb/>
nurse has vied with a mother in warm and self-sacrificing <lb/>
devotion for her little charges; and all this wholesome and <lb/>
healing affection would be lost if the plan advocated by <lb/>
the Edgeworths were carried out. It is satisfactory to <lb/>
hear that Mrs. Barbauld protested against this doctrine, <lb/>
and told Mr. Edgeworth that, besides the fact that it would <lb/>
foster pride and ingratitude, "one and twenty other good <lb/>
reasons could be alleged against it." It may be hoped that <lb/>
Mr. Edgeworth acknowledged himself vanquished before <lb/>
this formidable battery opened fire.</p>
<p>One of the most delightful incidents of Miss <reg orig="Edge-|worth's">Edgeworth's</reg> <lb/>
later life was her friendship with Sir Walter Scott. <lb/>
When the first of the Waverley Novels appeared, the secret <lb/>
of its authorship had been so carefully kept that every one <lb/>
was in the dark on the subject. The publishers had sent <lb/>
a copy to Miss Edgeworth and her father. As soon as Mr. <lb/>
Edgeworth had finished reading it, he exclaimed, "Aut <lb/>
Scotus, aut Diabolus," <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> "either Scott or the Devil"; <lb/>
and Maria put these words at the top of the letter which <lb/>
she wrote thanking the publishers for the book. Scott <lb/>
was already known to the world by his poems, and to this <lb/>
must be attributed the ready wit of the good guess made <lb/>
by the Edgeworths; for up to this time neither father nor <lb/>
<pb n="159" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0174"/>
daughter had had the pleasure of meeting Scott. In 1823, <lb/>
however, they did meet, and the acquaintance soon ripened <lb/>
into a lifelong friendship. Scott acted as guide to Miss <lb/>
Edgeworth and her sisters in showing them the beauties <lb/>
and monuments of Edinburgh. They visited him at <reg orig="Ab-|botsford">Abbotsford</reg>, <lb/>
and took a little tour together in the beautiful <lb/>
scenery of the Highlands. There are delightful <reg orig="descrip-|tions">descriptions</reg> <lb/>
in Miss Edgeworth's letters of Scott and his wife; <lb/>
and we have a pretty little picture of Scott and Lady Scott <lb/>
driving out, he with his dog, Spicer, in his lap, and she with <lb/>
her dog, Ourisk, in hers.</p>
<p>When Maria arrived at Abbotsford, and was received by <lb/>
her host at his archway, she exclaimed, "Everything about <lb/>
you is exactly what one ought to have had wit enough to <lb/>
dream." Two years later, Scott, accompanied by his <lb/>
daughter and other members of his family, paid a return <lb/>
visit to Edgeworthstown House. Lockhart, Scott's <reg orig="bio-|grapher">biographer</reg> <lb/>
and son-in-law, was one of the party. In his <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Life of Scott</hi> he tells how on one occasion he himself <lb/>
let fall some remark that poets and novelists probably <lb/>
regarded the whole of human life simply as providing <lb/>
them with the materials for their art. "A soft and <lb/>
pensive shade came over Scott's face as he said, 'I fear <lb/>
you have some very young ideas in your head. Are you <lb/>
not too apt to measure things by some reference to <reg orig="litera-|ture">literature</reg>, <lb/>
to disbelieve that anybody can be worth much care, <lb/>
who has no knowledge of that sort of thing, or taste for it? <lb/>
God help us! What a poor world this would be if that <lb/>
were the true doctrine! I have read books enough, and <lb/>
observed and conversed with enough of eminent and <lb/>
splendidly cultivated minds, too, in my time; but I assure <lb/>
you I have heard higher sentiments from the lips of poor <lb/>
uneducated men and women, when exerting the spirit of <lb/>
severe yet gentle heroism under difficulties and afflictions, <lb/>
or speaking their simple thoughts as to circumstances in <lb/>
the lot of friends and neighbours, than I ever yet met with <lb/>
out of the pages of the Bible. We shall never learn to feel <lb/>
and respect our true calling and destiny, unless we have <lb/>
<pb n="160" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0175"/>
taught ourselves to consider everything as moonshine, <reg orig="com-|pared">compared</reg> <lb/>
with the education of the heart.' Maria did not <lb/>
listen to this without some water in her eyes &hellip; but she <lb/>
brushed her tears gaily aside, and said, 'You see how it is. <lb/>
Dean Swift said he had written his books in order that <lb/>
people might learn to treat him like a great lord. Sir <lb/>
Walter writes his in order that he may be able to treat his <lb/>
people as a great lord ought to do.'"</p>
<p>The delightful friendship between the two authors <reg orig="con-|tinued">continued</reg> <lb/>
without interruption till Scott's death in the autumn <lb/>
of 1832. The clouds that overshadowed his later years <lb/>
were bitterly lamented by Maria. She wrote of the "<reg orig="poig-|nant">poignant</reg> <lb/>
anguish" she felt from the thought that such a life <lb/>
had been shortened by care and trouble. She declined, <lb/>
with one exception, to allow Scott's letters to herself to be <lb/>
published. If they are still in existence, the reasons which <lb/>
caused her to withhold them no longer exist, and judging <lb/>
from all we know of Scott and of her, it would be a great <lb/>
gain to the public to be afforded the opportunity of reading <lb/>
them.</p>
<p>Those who have read this series of short biographies <lb/>
will find a great many of the subjects of these sketches <lb/>
among Miss Edgeworth's friends. She gives a delightful <lb/>
description of Mrs. Fry, whom she once accompanied to <lb/>
Newgate. "She opened the Bible," wrote Miss Edgeworth, <lb/>
"and read in the most sweetly solemn, sedate voice I ever <lb/>
heard, slowly and distinctly, without anything in the <lb/>
manner that would detract attention from the matter." <lb/>
The Herschels and Mrs. Somerville were also numbered <lb/>
among her friends. People sometimes seem to think that <lb/>
women who can write books, and have learnt to <reg orig="under-|stand">understand</reg> <lb/>
the wonders of science, will probably cease to care <lb/>
for feminine nicety in dress. It is therefore very pleasant <lb/>
to find that Mrs. Somerville, the author of <hi rend="italic">The Connection <lb/>
of the Physical Sciences,</hi> and Miss Edgeworth had a <reg orig="confer-|ence">conference</reg> <lb/>
about a blue cr&ecirc;pe turban.</p>
<p>Maria Edgeworth's life did not pass without the romance <lb/>
of love. She received an offer of marriage from a Swedish <lb/>
<pb n="161" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0176"/>
gentleman, while she was staying in Paris with her family <lb/>
in 1803. She returned his affection, but refused to marry <lb/>
him, sacrificing herself and him to what she believed to be <lb/>
her duty to her father and family. Her third and last <reg orig="step-|mother">stepmother</reg> <lb/>
wrote that for years "the unexpected mention of <lb/>
his name, or even that of Sweden, in a book or newspaper, <lb/>
always moved her so much that the words and lines in the <lb/>
page became a mass of confusion before her eyes, and her <lb/>
voice lost all power." Her suitor, M. Edelcrantz, never <lb/>
married. At the altar of filial piety she sacrificed much.</p>
<p>Nothing is more charming, in the character of Maria <lb/>
Edgeworth, than the sweetness with which she put her own <lb/>
feelings on one side, and welcomed one after another, her <lb/>
numerous step-mothers. The third and last, a Miss <reg orig="Beau-|fort">Beaufort</reg>, <lb/>
was considerably younger than Maria. The marriage <lb/>
with Mrs. Edgeworth No. 4 took place about six months <lb/>
after the death of Mrs. Edgeworth No. 3. No wonder that <lb/>
even the inexhaustible patience of the good daughter was <lb/>
rather tried by this rapidity. She owns that when she first <lb/>
heard of the attachment, she did not wish for the marriage; <lb/>
but her will was in all respects resolutely turned towards <lb/>
whatever would promote her father's happiness. She did <lb/>
not permit her regret to last, and she welcomed the bride <lb/>
not only with unaffected cordiality, but with sincerest <lb/>
friendship.</p>
<p>Another pleasant characteristic of Maria was the cheery <lb/>
way in which she recognised and bore with the fact that <lb/>
she was the only plain member of her family. There is <lb/>
a nice old sister in <hi rend="italic">Silas Marner</hi> who says to some ladies <lb/>
who had not at all recognised their own want of beauty, <lb/>
"I don't mind being ugly a bit, do you?" Maria was like <lb/>
this, except that she thought she possessed a pre-eminence <lb/>
of ugliness over all other competitors. "Nobody is ugly <lb/>
now," she wrote in 1831, "but myself!" Impartial <reg orig="ob-|servers">observers</reg>, <lb/>
however, state that the plainness of her features <lb/>
was redeemed by the sweetness and vivacity of her <reg orig="expres-|sion">expression</reg>, <lb/>
and by the exquisite neatness of her tiny figure.</p>
<p>Many examples could be given of her practical good <lb/>
<pb n="162" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0177"/>
sense and benevolence. On receiving a legacy of some <lb/>
diamond ornaments, she sold them, and with the proceeds <lb/>
built a market-house for the village in Ireland where she <lb/>
lived. In 1826, nine years after her father's death, she <lb/>
again undertook, this time for her brother, the management <lb/>
of the estates. She exerted herself with characteristic <lb/>
energy to alleviate the sufferings of her country during <lb/>
the terrible year of the Irish famine. She died very <lb/>
suddenly and painlessly, two years later, in the arms of <lb/>
her step-mother, on 22d May 1849, aged eighty-two. <lb/>
Macaulay considered her the second woman in Europe <lb/>
of her time, giving the first place to Madame de Sta&euml;l. <lb/>
She does not seem to us now so great as this; but a <lb/>
variety of interests centre round her, and she well <reg orig="de-|serves">deserves</reg> <lb/>
to be remembered.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">It</hi> is very difficult for us now to go back in imagination to <lb/>
the time, between eighty and ninety years ago, when the <lb/>
whole of Europe was in danger of being crushed under the <lb/>
tyranny and rapacious cruelty of Napoleon Buonaparte.</p>
<p>This miraculous man, with his insatiable ambition, his <lb/>
almost more than human power and less than human <lb/>
unscrupulousness, had raised himself from a comparatively <lb/>
humble station, not only to be Emperor of France, but to <lb/>
be the conqueror of Italy, Spain, Sweden, and Germany. <lb/>
He dreamed that in his person was to be revived the ancient <lb/>
empire of Charlemagne, and that all the nations of <lb/>
Christendom were to be subject to his universal dominion. <lb/>
He crowned himself in the presence of the Pope, in Paris, <lb/>
in 1804, and the year following he had the iron crown of <lb/>
the kings of Lombardy placed on his head at Milan. Not <lb/>
<pb n="164" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0179"/>
content with the title of Emperor of France, he styled <reg orig="him-|self">himself</reg> <lb/>
Emperor of the West, conceding for a time to the Czar <lb/>
of Russia the title of Emperor of the East.</p>
<p>No combination of the other Powers seemed capable of <lb/>
withstanding his wonderful military genius. Most of all <lb/>
his foes, he hated England; because, to the eternal honour <lb/>
of our country, be it remembered, England took the lead in <lb/>
rousing the other nations of Europe to resist him. England <lb/>
was the banker of almost every coalition that was formed <lb/>
against him. She supplied men, armies, and armed ships, <lb/>
where she could, and she supplied money to carry on war <lb/>
against Napoleon everywhere. Our great minister, William <lb/>
Pitt, threw himself and all the wealth and power of England <lb/>
into this great struggle against Napoleon. Again and again <lb/>
he revived the spirit of resistance among the other Powers. <lb/>
The rulers and representatives of other countries allowed <lb/>
themselves to be flattered and bribed and threatened into <lb/>
lending themselves to the objects of Napoleon's inordinate <lb/>
ambition. The Czar consented to meet him on intimate <lb/>
and friendly terms; the Emperor of Austria, <reg orig="notwithstand-|ing">notwithstanding</reg> <lb/>
the cruel humiliations he had suffered, consented to <lb/>
give his daughter to take the place of the unjustly divorced <lb/>
wife of the Corsican upstart; the less important German <lb/>
princes cringed before him. The hostility of England alone <lb/>
was implacable and unceasing, and what made her even <lb/>
more hated, successful.</p>
<p>There is little doubt that Napoleon fully recognised that <lb/>
England was the main obstacle in the way of the fulfilment <lb/>
of his dream of universal dominion. His most darling <reg orig="pro-|ject">project</reg> <lb/>
was to crush the power of England, and in 1804&ndash;5 he <lb/>
made preparations for the invasion of our country, <reg orig="assem-|bling">assembling</reg> <lb/>
a vast army at Boulogne for that purpose. So fast did <lb/>
his ambition outrun the bounds of fact and common sense, <lb/>
that he actually had a medal struck to commemorate the <lb/>
conquest of England. On one side was his own head <lb/>
crowned with the laurel wreath of victory; on the other, <lb/>
was a representation of Hercules strangling a giant, with <lb/>
the lying inscription, "Struck in London, 1804." He <lb/>
<pb n="165" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0180"/>
wrote to the admiral of the French fleet, which was <lb/>
destined about two months later to be completely destroyed <lb/>
by our great Nelson at Trafalgar: "Set out, lose not a <lb/>
moment, bring our united squadron into the Channel and <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">England is ours</hi>." It was at this moment of supreme <reg orig="sus-|pense">suspense</reg> <lb/>
and danger that Wordsworth wrote that stirring <lb/>
sonnet to the men of Kent, the words of which vibrated <lb/>
through the nation like a trumpet call.</p>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>Vanguard of Liberty, ye men of Kent,</l>
<l>Ye children of a Soil that doth advance</l>
<l>Her haughty brow against the coast of France,</l>
<l>Now is the time to prove your hardiment!</l>
<l>To France be words of invitation sent!</l>
<l>They from their fields can see the countenance</l>
<l>Of your fierce war, may ken the glittering lance,</l>
<l>And hear you shouting forth your brave intent.</l>
<l>Left single, in bold parley, ye, of yore,</l>
<l>Did from the Norman win a gallant wreath;</l>
<l>Confirmed the charters that were yours before;&mdash;</l>
<l>No parleying now! in Britain is one breath;</l>
<l>We all are with you now from shore to shore:&mdash;</l>
<l>Ye men of Kent, 'tis victory or death!</l>
</lg></q>
<p>England's immediate relief from the danger of invasion <lb/>
did not come from Nelson's great victory, but from Pitt <lb/>
once more rousing the powers of Austria and Russia to <lb/>
combine against Napoleon. Pitt insisted, in the spring of <lb/>
1805, on pain of losing the subsidies promised by England,<lb/>
that Austria should at once declare war upon France; and <lb/>
Napoleon was thereupon obliged to withdraw the forces he <lb/>
had assembled in great numbers at Boulogne to meet the new <lb/>
combination that had been formed against him. It was now a <lb/>
question how strong that combination should be. The two <lb/>
great Powers of Austria and Russia had already joined it; the <lb/>
smaller German princes went, some on this side and some on <lb/>
that. The only important Power that showed indecision <lb/>
at this critical moment was Prussia. The King of Prussia, <lb/>
Frederick William III, was a grand-nephew of Frederick <lb/>
the Great; but he bore no resemblance to that sovereign. <lb/>
<pb n="166" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0181"/>
He was weak and undecided in character, wishing to <lb/>
strengthen and enlarge his kingdom, but without force of <lb/>
character sufficient to decide on a wise line of conduct and <lb/>
to adhere to it. He and his minister, Haugwitz, cast <reg orig="long-|ing">longing</reg> <lb/>
eyes upon Hanover, the Electorate of which was then <lb/>
united with the crown of England. The French had <lb/>
seized Hanover, and the possession of this coveted territory <lb/>
was skilfully dangled by Napoleon before the eyes of the <lb/>
King of Prussia. Frederick William III could not arrive <lb/>
at a decision whether he should serve his own interests <lb/>
best by joining the coalition or by remaining friends with <lb/>
Napoleon. While he was hesitating, Napoleon, with his <lb/>
customary disregard of all law, violated a neutral territory, <lb/>
belonging to the Kingdom of Prussia, by taking his army <lb/>
across it. It was like offering one hand in friendship, and <lb/>
boxing the ears of your friend with the other. Angry as <lb/>
the whole of Prussia was by the insult thus offered her, <lb/>
she did not bring herself boldly to join the coalition of <lb/>
England, Austria, and Russia against Napoleon. The <lb/>
vacillating character of the King and the intriguing <reg orig="di-|plomacy">diplomacy</reg> <lb/>
of Haugwitz stood in the way; but it must not be <lb/>
supposed that in the general body of the Prussian people <lb/>
there was not a feeling of shame, anger, and resentment at <lb/>
the policy that had been adopted by their Government.</p>
<p>The embodiment of this strong national feeling was <lb/>
found in the person of the beautiful young Queen Louisa, a <lb/>
princess of the House of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. Her <reg orig="char-|acter">character</reg> <lb/>
was a complete contrast to that of her husband. <lb/>
She had the decision, vivacity, and high courage which he <lb/>
so much lacked. The two were sincerely devoted to one <lb/>
another; but from the essential differences in their <reg orig="dis-|positions">dispositions</reg>, <lb/>
they became respectively the heads of the <lb/>
two opposing parties in the State; the party who wished <lb/>
to join the coalition and resist Napoleon, and the party <lb/>
who wished merely to look on and try to reap some <lb/>
advantage from whichever side was favoured by the <lb/>
fortunes of war. It seemed at one time as if the <lb/>
Queen's influence with her husband had prevailed, and <lb/>
<pb n="167" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0182"/>
that Prussia was going to join the alliance; but just <lb/>
at this time came the news of the first of Napoleon's great <lb/>
victories in this campaign, the capitulation of Ulm, and all <lb/>
the fears of the timid party were renewed. Then came the <lb/>
great catastrophe of Austerlitz; Napoleon's forces had <reg orig="com-|pletely">completely</reg> <lb/>
crushed the combined armies of Russia and Austria, <lb/>
and Pitt's last supreme effort against Napoleon had failed. <lb/>
Austerlitz is said to have killed Pitt. He was only <reg orig="forty-|seven">forty-seven</reg>; <lb/>
but his health had long been feeble, and this last blow <lb/>
to all his hopes was fatal. He died a few weeks after the <lb/>
news reached him, on the 23d January 1806. He <reg orig="attri-|buted">attributed</reg> <lb/>
the failure of the coalition to the indecision of Prussia. <lb/>
If he was right in this he had a terrible revenge. It is one <lb/>
of the most extraordinary episodes in history that Prussia, <lb/>
which had hesitated to join one of the most powerful <lb/>
alliances that had ever been formed against Napoleon, was <lb/>
destined within a few months to match itself against the <lb/>
conqueror almost single-handed.</p>
<p>Very soon after the battle of Austerlitz the Prussian <lb/>
minister, Haugwitz, waited upon Napoleon and renewed <lb/>
negotiations with him. Napoleon offered Prussia the choice <lb/>
between immediate war, or alliance and the possession of <lb/>
Hanover. A treaty was drawn up accepting the latter <lb/>
alternative; Haugwitz agreed to it, and carried it back to <lb/>
his master for ratification. When the terms of the treaty <lb/>
became known in Berlin, the anger of the patriotic party <lb/>
was unbounded. They felt they were bound by ties of <lb/>
blood and kindred to espouse the cause of their German <lb/>
brethren. They looked upon the proffered bribe of Hanover <lb/>
as hush-money, which was to close their lips from <reg orig="protest-|ing">protesting</reg> <lb/>
against the oppression of Germany by Napoleon. When <lb/>
Haugwitz returned to Berlin he was treated with marked <lb/>
coldness by the Queen. On receiving the disastrous news <lb/>
of the defeat of Austerlitz, she had called to her side her <lb/>
two elder boys, the younger of whom became the late aged <lb/>
Emperor of Germany, and adjured them to think, from <lb/>
that time forth, only of avenging their unhappy brethren. <lb/>
The King's brothers sympathised with the Queen's views, <lb/>
<pb n="168" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0183"/>
as did also the patriotic statesmen Stein and Hardenburg, <lb/>
and a brave young prince, Louis Ferdinand, the King's <lb/>
cousin. Miss Hudson, who has written a life of Queen <lb/>
Louisa, says in reference to her position at this crisis, "The <lb/>
Queen did not desire or endeavour to take a leading <lb/>
part, but she did not dissemble her feelings and aspirations, <lb/>
and her name was put foremost by popular report, on <reg orig="ac-|count">account</reg> <lb/>
of her superior rank. The Queen did not play any <lb/>
conspicuous part, but she was a constant incentive to the <lb/>
best of the nation to work for their country's deliverance. <lb/>
It was what she was, not what she did, that made her name <lb/>
a watchword for the enemies of Napoleon."</p>
<p>Haugwitz had never dreamed that his master would <lb/>
refuse to ratify the treaty; but the outburst of popular <lb/>
anger against it had been so marked, and the advantages <lb/>
it offered to Prussia were in fact so small, that the <lb/>
King declined to sign, and demanded modifications. His <lb/>
vacillation had placed him in a cleft stick. If he refused <lb/>
Napoleon's terms, he would have to fight with the <reg orig="victori-|ous">victorious</reg> <lb/>
French army; if he accepted them, and Hanover with <lb/>
them, he would have to fight with England; for it was not <lb/>
probable that the latter country would calmly allow Hanover <lb/>
to be appropriated by another Power without a struggle. <lb/>
While this was the situation of affairs, the King of Prussia, <lb/>
having sent back the treaty to Napoleon to ask for <lb/>
modifications, one of which was to obtain the consent of <lb/>
England to the cession of Hanover, the news came to all <lb/>
the world that Pitt, the most powerful and the most <lb/>
pertinacious of Napoleon's enemies, was dead. England <lb/>
had lost Nelson and Pitt within a few months. It seemed <lb/>
as if they had been removed to make the pathway of <lb/>
ambition smooth for Napoleon.</p>
<p>Pitt was succeeded in the Ministry by his great rival <lb/>
Fox, the professed admirer of the French Revolution, a man <lb/>
whose measure Napoleon thought he had taken, and whom <lb/>
the Emperor believed he could dupe with fine phrases about <lb/>
universal brotherhood and a union of hearts. Napoleon <lb/>
instantly saw the advantage this change might bring to <lb/>
<pb n="169" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0184"/>
him. With audacity unparalleled, except by himself, he <lb/>
commenced negotiations with the English Government and <lb/>
offered <hi rend="italic">them</hi> Hanover, notwithstanding that the ink was <lb/>
hardly dry on the treaty in which he had offered it to <lb/>
Prussia. Napoleon, intent for the moment on this fresh <lb/>
project of pacifying England, received Haugwitz, when he <lb/>
presented his master's modifications of the treaty, with <lb/>
harsh and contemptuous insolence. The conditions of the <lb/>
treaty were made still more onerous than before on Prussia. <lb/>
Napoleon now wanted to force a quarrel between England <lb/>
and Prussia, of which he himself would in any result reap <lb/>
the advantages. He carried on this project for a time so <lb/>
successfully that England did actually declare war against <lb/>
Prussia, but hostilities between them never actually took <lb/>
place, because it became evident that Prussia had only been <lb/>
a cat's paw in the hand of Napoleon. The new treaty which <lb/>
Napoleon returned to Frederick William was so humiliating <lb/>
to Prussia, that Haugwitz did not dare to take it to Berlin <lb/>
himself, but sent it by another hand. The King was so <lb/>
weak and foolish as to sign it, and from that moment <lb/>
Napoleon poured insult after insult upon the unhappy <lb/>
government which had consented to its own slavery. One <lb/>
of his first acts was to insist on the dismissal of Hardenberg, <lb/>
one of the most trusted of the Prussian ministers. Under <lb/>
the pretext of a new Confederation of the Rhine, it became <lb/>
evident that Napoleon meant to entirely alter the whole <lb/>
constitution of Germany without consulting Prussia, or any <lb/>
of the Powers chiefly concerned. The French ambassador <lb/>
had orders to state that "his master no longer recognised <lb/>
the Germanic constitution." Under these new humiliations, <lb/>
the war fever burst out more strongly than ever, all over <lb/>
Prussia. Unequal as the contest was, all that was best in <lb/>
the nation preferred any risk to the humble acceptance of <lb/>
the galling tyranny that oppressed them. The young men <lb/>
in Berlin showed what their feelings were by assembling <lb/>
in crowds outside the house of the French ambassador, <lb/>
and sharpening their swords on his doorstep and window sills.</p>
<p>It may very well be believed that Fox, if he had lived, <lb/>
<pb n="170" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0185"/>
would have carried out Pitt's policy in resisting Napoleon. <lb/>
Already his eyes must have been opened by the perfidious <lb/>
transactions about Hanover; but while the process of <lb/>
disillusion was proceeding, Fox died, in September 1806, a <lb/>
few months after his great rival. Napoleon stated, in after <lb/>
years, that he considered the death of Fox, at this juncture, <lb/>
was the first great blow his power had received. "Fox's <lb/>
death," he often said at St. Helena, "was one of the <reg orig="fatal-|ities">fatalities</reg> <lb/>
of my career." The English policy of resistance to <lb/>
Napoleon had hardly received more than a temporary check <lb/>
by Fox's accession to office, and when Prussia finally decided <lb/>
on fighting with Napoleon, she was promised assistance <lb/>
both from Russia and England. The struggle, however, <lb/>
took place under cruel disadvantages to the weaker side. <lb/>
Napoleon was at the head of 200,000 veterans confident of <lb/>
victory, and of the irresistible genius of their commander. <lb/>
Moreover, the French army, or a great portion of it, was <lb/>
even then on Prussian soil. It was impossible that the <lb/>
Prussian army could rely on Frederick William, as the <lb/>
French army relied on its great general. The Queen did <lb/>
all she could by joining the army, and living in camp, with <lb/>
her husband, to the very eve of the battle, to encourage the <lb/>
spirit of the troops, and above all to prevent any change of <lb/>
front at the last moment. The most experienced of the <lb/>
Prussian generals begged the Queen to remain with the <lb/>
army. One of them wrote, "Pray say all you can to induce <lb/>
her to remain. I know what I am asking; her presence <lb/>
with us is quite necessary."</p>
<p>The final spark which caused the combustible material <lb/>
to burst into the flame of war, was the cruel murder of <lb/>
the Nuremberg bookseller, Palm, by Napoleon, for selling <lb/>
a pamphlet called, "The Humiliation of Germany." He was <lb/>
decoyed upon neutral territory, and was shot on the 25th <lb/>
August 1806, without even the pretence of a legal trial. <lb/>
Rather more than a month later, Prussia had declared war. <lb/>
Her army was very inferior to that of France. The <lb/>
highest number at which it has been put, even with the <lb/>
Russian auxiliaries, is 60,000. The troops from England <lb/>
<pb n="171" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0186"/>
did not arrive in time to be of any use. In two great <lb/>
battles, Jena and Auerstadt, fought on the same day, 16th <lb/>
October 1806, the power and independence of Prussia were <lb/>
completely crushed. No wonder that all the world at that <lb/>
moment thought them annihilated! A few days later <lb/>
Napoleon made his triumphal entry into Berlin. He <lb/>
occupied the Royal Palaces there and at Potsdam, from <lb/>
which the Queen had lately fled with her children. It <lb/>
was then that Napoleon covered himself with everlasting <lb/>
infamy by a series of bulletins published in an official <lb/>
gazette called <hi rend="italic">The Telegraph,</hi> in which he poured every <lb/>
kind of insult and calumny upon the person, character, and <lb/>
influence of the Queen. He ransacked her private <reg orig="apart-|ments">apartments</reg>, <lb/>
read her correspondence, and sought eagerly, but <lb/>
in vain, for evidence to support the monstrous charges he <lb/>
brought against her. She was among the most womanly <lb/>
of women, devoted to her home, to her children and <lb/>
husband. Every true woman is more sensitive on what <lb/>
touches the honour and sanctity of her home than on any <lb/>
other subject. It was here, therefore, that Napoleon <lb/>
struck at her with all the brute violence and perfidy of <lb/>
his nature. M. Lanfrey, the French historian, says that a <lb/>
volume might be filled with all that he wrote and <lb/>
published against her. He wished to render her odious in <lb/>
the eyes of her people, and held her up to ridicule as well <lb/>
as to calumny. He represented that her pretended <lb/>
patriotism was only put on to hide her guilty passion for <lb/>
"the handsome Emperor of Russia," that nothing had <lb/>
aroused her from "the grave occupations of dress, in <lb/>
which she had been hitherto absorbed," but the desire to <lb/>
bring about more frequent opportunities of intercourse <lb/>
with her supposed lover. The stupidity of all this, <lb/>
repeated again and again in bulletin after bulletin, is as <lb/>
wonderful as its wickedness. The effect of it in the minds <lb/>
of the German people is almost as fresh to-day as it was <lb/>
eighty years ago. They had loved and trusted their good, <lb/>
brave Queen, before Napoleon tried to cover her with the <lb/>
mud of his impure imagination. Afterwards, and to this <lb/>
<pb n="172" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0187"/>
day, they adored her as no modern queen has ever been <lb/>
adored. No stranger can be many days in North Germany <lb/>
now without being forced to ask, "Who is this Queen <lb/>
Louisa, whose portrait is in every shop window, and after <lb/>
whom streets and squares by the dozen are called?" Her <lb/>
name has become the symbol of all that is best in German <lb/>
national life, simplicity of living, patriotism and devotion <lb/>
to duty. M. Lanfrey, whose history of Napoleon has been <lb/>
already quoted, says of the bulletins attacking the Queen, <lb/>
"Such circumstances as these indicate the defect of <lb/>
Napoleon's moral organisation, amounting, in fact, to an <lb/>
absence of ordinary intelligence. He outraged the most <lb/>
delicate scruples of the human conscience, because such <lb/>
sentiments had no existence in his own heart. He made <lb/>
a grave mistake in treating other men as if they were as <lb/>
utterly devoid as he was himself of all sentiment of honour <lb/>
and morality. He did not perceive that these base <lb/>
insinuations against a fugitive and disarmed woman, by a <lb/>
man who commanded 500,000 soldiers, would produce an <lb/>
effect exactly contrary to what he intended; that they <lb/>
were calculated not only to excite disgust in all noble <lb/>
minds, but were revolting even to the most vulgar." How <lb/>
little did either the conqueror or the conquered foresee <lb/>
what lay hidden in the womb of time! Prince William, <lb/>
then a delicate child of eight years old, and a fugitive, <lb/>
with his mother, before the victorious army of Napoleon, <lb/>
was destined to become the most powerful sovereign in <lb/>
Europe, to bring to an end the Napoleonic dynasty, and <lb/>
in the chief of the Royal Palaces of France, to be crowned <lb/>
Emperor of a United Germany.</p>
<p>In 1806, however, the fortunes of Queen Louisa and <lb/>
her children were at the lowest ebb. After having lost so <lb/>
much that was more precious than the state and luxury of <lb/>
royalty, the privations of the fugitive Court were not an <lb/>
insupportable trial; the kind peasants brought gifts of <lb/>
money and provisions to their King and Queen, and many <lb/>
acts of faithfulness and devotion cheered and consoled <lb/>
Frederick William and his wife. Even ill-health, which <lb/>
<pb n="173" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0188"/>
now began to be visible in the Queen, seemed a small <lb/>
misfortune compared with others she had endured. She <lb/>
wrote at this period, June 1807, that her greatest <reg orig="un-|happiness">unhappiness</reg> <lb/>
was being unable to hope. "Those who have <lb/>
been torn up by the roots &hellip; have lost the faculty of <lb/>
hoping." Still she felt sustained by the confidence that <lb/>
Prussia, though humiliated, was not disgraced. The <lb/>
country had had fearful odds against it, and had been <lb/>
vanquished, but it had striven to do its duty. "Wrong <lb/>
and injustice on our side would have brought me down to <lb/>
the grave," she wrote.</p>
<p>A treaty of peace was now about to be drawn up. <lb/>
Napoleon, the Emperor of Russia, and the King of Prussia, <lb/>
met in a grand ceremonial way at Tilsit. The Emperor <lb/>
of Russia was considered by Napoleon sufficiently powerful <lb/>
to be treated with flattery and consideration. The King <lb/>
of Prussia, being helpless, was harshly dealt with; and <lb/>
when the terms of the peace were discussed, Napoleon was <lb/>
inexorable in insisting on an almost complete destruction <lb/>
of the power of Prussia. All the principal fortified towns <lb/>
in Prussia, including Magdeburg, which commanded the <lb/>
Elbe, were to remain in the hands of the French; and the <lb/>
standing army of Prussia was to be limited to 42,000 men.</p>
<p>The idea appears to have occurred to the Emperor of <lb/>
Russia, that if Queen Louisa joined her husband at Tilsit <lb/>
she could induce Napoleon to modify these harsh conditions <lb/>
of peace. Frederick William concurred, and wrote to the <lb/>
Queen, requesting her immediate presence to intercede <lb/>
with Napoleon for more favourable terms. No wonder, <lb/>
when the King's letter was placed in her hands, that the <lb/>
Queen burst into tears, and said it was the hardest thing <lb/>
she had ever been called upon to bear and do. All her <lb/>
woman's pride revolted against humbling herself to beg for <lb/>
favours from the man who but the other day had so <lb/>
brutally insulted her. But she thought, how could she, <lb/>
who had urged her sons to die for their country, refuse to <lb/>
sacrifice her just and natural resentment for the same end? <lb/>
She set out without delay, and the famous interview <lb/>
<pb n="174" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0189"/>
between herself and Napoleon was speedily arranged. He <lb/>
now treated her with every outward mark of respect, and <lb/>
was perhaps surprised to find the fancy picture he had <lb/>
drawn of her, in his infamous bulletins, falsified in every <lb/>
particular. She would not allow him to trifle with her, <lb/>
and lead the conversation away to commonplaces, but <lb/>
went straight to the object which had brought her to <lb/>
Tilsit, the granting of moderate terms of peace to Prussia. <lb/>
She was calm, dignified, and courteous; once only her <lb/>
self-command failed her: "When she spoke of the Prussian <lb/>
people, and of her husband, she could not restrain her <lb/>
tears." She begged the conqueror at least to grant to <lb/>
Prussia the possession of Magdeburg. The French <lb/>
minister, Talleyrand, who was present at the interview, <lb/>
thought that Napoleon wavered; but a tiger with a kid <lb/>
in his claws does not easily relinquish it, even if an <lb/>
archangel pleads with him. The interview was brought to <lb/>
an end, with no concession promised. The Queen and <lb/>
Emperor met again at a State banquet the same evening, <lb/>
and again the following day at a smaller private gathering. <lb/>
But she had humbled her pride in vain. Her first words <lb/>
after the final leavetaking were, "I have been cruelly <lb/>
deceived." Napoleon did not hesitate to misrepresent to <lb/>
his wife, the Empress Josephine, the whole bearing of the <lb/>
Queen of Prussia to him: "She is fond of coquetting with <lb/>
me," he wrote; "but do not be jealous." But to <reg orig="Talley-|rand">Talleyrand</reg>, <lb/>
who could not be deceived, because he was present <lb/>
at Tilsit at all the interviews that had taken place between <lb/>
the two, Napoleon said, "I knew that I should see a <lb/>
beautiful woman, and a Queen with dignified manners, but <lb/>
I found the most admirable Queen, and at the same time <lb/>
the most interesting woman I had ever met with." On <lb/>
another occasion he remarked to Talleyrand that the <lb/>
"Queen of Prussia attached too much importance to the <lb/>
dignity of her sex, and to the value of public opinion." <lb/>
From a man of Napoleon's gross and low estimate of <lb/>
womanhood, a greater compliment would be impossible. </p>
<p>The French army was withdrawn from Berlin in <lb/>
<pb n="175" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0190"/>
December 1808. The King and Queen of Prussia did <lb/>
not re-enter their capital till December 1809. In the <lb/>
following July, Louisa died. Spasms of the heart had <lb/>
come on, a short time previously, during the illness of one <lb/>
of her children. They returned with a violence which she <lb/>
had not strength to resist. Her husband and her people <lb/>
felt that she had died of a broken heart. The short-lived <lb/>
rejoicings that had greeted her return to Berlin were now <lb/>
changed into devotion to her memory, and to the cause <lb/>
of German patriotism with which her name will always <lb/>
be associated. The King, his children, and his subjects <lb/>
mourned her loss with unceasing fidelity and reverence. <lb/>
Four years after her death, Frederick William and his <lb/>
Russian allies crushed Napoleon's army at the battle of <lb/>
Leipzig. On his return to Berlin, the King's first thought <lb/>
was to lay the laurel wreath of victory on his wife's tomb. <lb/>
Queen Louisa's eldest son directed that his heart should <lb/>
be buried at the foot of his mother's grave, and the same <lb/>
spot was also selected as the last resting-place of her <lb/>
second son, the Emperor William. It will long be <lb/>
remembered that it was here that the late Emperor, then <lb/>
King William of Prussia, knelt alone, in silent meditation <lb/>
and stern resolve, on the sixtieth anniversary of his <lb/>
mother's death, just at the time of the outbreak of the <lb/>
war of 1870 between France and Germany.</p>
<p>She was only thirty-five years old when she died; but <lb/>
she was able to leave to her children and to her people a <lb/>
name that will be remembered and honoured as long as <lb/>
the German Empire lasts. Her tomb at Charlottenburg is <lb/>
one of the most beautiful monuments to the memory of <lb/>
the dead, which the world contains. The pure white <lb/>
marble statue of the Queen is by the sculptor Rauch, who <lb/>
knew her well, and honoured her as she deserved. <reg orig="Every-|thing">Everything</reg> <lb/>
about the building is designed with loving care. <lb/>
The words chosen by the King, and placed over the <reg orig="en-|trance">entrance</reg> <lb/>
of the temple where the monument lies, are: "I am <lb/>
he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for <lb/>
evermore, Amen: and have the keys of hell and of death."</p>

</cit>
</epigraph>
<p>A <hi rend="small-caps">hundred</hi> years ago England was particularly rich in <lb/>
great brothers and sisters. There were William and <lb/>
Caroline Herschel, Charles and Mary Lamb, and, perhaps, <lb/>
chief of all, William and Dorothy Wordsworth. These <lb/>
last were certainly the greatest as tested by the position <lb/>
of the brother in the world of literature. He won and <lb/>
maintained a place among the greatest of English poets; <lb/>
but the very greatness of the brother was the cause why <lb/>
the sister is known only as a tributary to his genius. It <lb/>
is not that his achievements dwarf hers by comparison; <lb/>
she made no conscious contribution to literature; she felt <lb/>
from the outset of their life together that he was capable <lb/>
of giving to his countrymen thoughts which the world <lb/>
would not willingly let die, and she deliberately suppressed <lb/>
in herself all cultivation of her own powers, save such as <lb/>
should contribute to support, sustain, and promote his. <lb/>
As Charles Lamb said of his own sister, "If the balance <lb/>
has been against her, it was a noble trade." There is, <reg orig="how-|ever">however</reg>, <lb/>
much evidence that the balance was not against <lb/>
Dorothy Wordsworth. She did not sacrifice herself in <lb/>
vain. She chose to give up all independent cultivation <lb/>
of her own considerable poetic gifts, and also to renounce <lb/>
<pb n="177" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0192"/>
all hopes of love and marriage, for the sake of devoting <lb/>
her whole life to her brother, and of helping to a freer <lb/>
and nobler utterance the poet who has given us "The Ode <lb/>
on the Intimations of Immortality," "The Ode to Duty," <lb/>
"The Happy Warrior," and a host of songs and sonnets <lb/>
among the most beautiful in our language. The sister <lb/>
freely and generously gave, the brother freely and <reg orig="gener-|ously">generously</reg> <lb/>
received, and freely and generously acknowledged <lb/>
the value of the gift. Over and over again, in prose and <lb/>
verse, Wordsworth acknowledges all that he owes to his <lb/>
sister; never more warmly than when, on the approach of <lb/>
old age, disease had laid its hand upon her, and the long <lb/>
accustomed support seemed likely to be withdrawn. When <lb/>
Coleridge and Dorothy lay prostrate under the stroke of <lb/>
sickness, Wordsworth wrote at the age of sixty-two: "He <lb/>
and my beloved sister are the two beings to whom my <reg orig="in-|tellect">intellect</reg> <lb/>
is most indebted, and they are now proceeding, as <lb/>
it were, with equal steps, along the path of sickness, I will <lb/>
not say towards the grave; but I trust towards a blessed <lb/>
immortality." If Wordsworth, reviewing the past, could <lb/>
speak thus of his sister, it must be of interest to us to <reg orig="en-|deavour">endeavour</reg> <lb/>
to discern what her influence over him was, and <lb/>
how their life together was passed.</p>
<p>William Wordsworth was born in 1770, at Cockermouth, <lb/>
in Cumberland, the second son of John Wordsworth, a <lb/>
lawyer and land-agent to the Earls of Lonsdale. Dorothy, <lb/>
her parents' only girl, was twenty months younger than <lb/>
William, and the two children very early showed that close <lb/>
sympathy and tender affection for one another which is often <lb/>
the precious possession of happy family life. Only a few <lb/>
years were spent together by the brother and sister in this <lb/>
joyous playtime of life; but the happiness of this early time <lb/>
is recorded in several of Wordsworth's poems, especially in <lb/>
the one where he speaks of his sister and their visit together <lb/>
to see the sparrow's nest&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="stanza">
<l>She looked at it and seemed to fear it;</l>
<l>Dreading, tho' wishing, to be near it:</l>
<l>Such heart was in her, being then</l>
</lg>
<pb n="178" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0193"/>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>A little Prattler among men.</l>
<l>The Blessing of my later years</l>
<l>Was with me when a boy:</l>
<l>She gave me eyes, she gave me ears;</l>
<l>And humble cares, and delicate fears;</l>
<l>A heart, the fountain of sweet tears;</l>
<l rend="indent">And love, and thought, and joy.</l>
</lg></q>
William and Dorothy were less than nine and seven <reg orig="re-|spectively">respectively</reg> <lb/>
when these happy days of childish <reg orig="companion-|ship">companionship</reg> <lb/>
were closed by the death of their mother in 1778. <lb/>
William was then sent to school, and Dorothy went to live <lb/>
with her maternal grandparents at Penrith. The children <lb/>
were doubly orphaned five years later by the death of their <lb/>
father, in 1783. William and his brothers then passed to <lb/>
the guardianship of their uncles, Richard and Christopher <lb/>
Wordsworth, while Dorothy was made over to the care of <lb/>
other relatives, and spent her time partly at Halifax and <lb/>
partly with her mother's cousin, Dr. Cookson, Canon of <lb/>
Windsor. She and William, however, by no means forgot <lb/>
their childish affection or let it grow cold. They rarely <lb/>
met at this time, but their meetings were looked forward <lb/>
to by both with ardent and intense pleasure. Each <reg orig="con-|tinued">continued</reg> <lb/>
to be to the other the dearest and most beloved of <lb/>
friends.</p>
<p>Wordsworth, like most generous young people of his <lb/>
day, was deeply stirred by sympathy with the French <lb/>
Revolution. At its outset he believed it would bring <reg orig="im-|measurable">immeasurable</reg> <lb/>
blessings to mankind; tyranny, cruelty, and <lb/>
vice were, he believed, to be dismissed from the high places <lb/>
of the earth, and in their stead would reign justice, mercy, <lb/>
peace, and love. It is therefore not difficult to imagine <lb/>
with what agony of disappointment he saw, as he thought, <lb/>
all these high hopes falsified, and the light that had been <lb/>
lit by the Revolution quenched in blood and in a series of <lb/>
massacres more cruel and remorseless than any that had <lb/>
disgraced previous forms of government. For a time the <lb/>
belief in goodness and righteousness seemed shaken in him. <lb/>
To disbelieve in the power of goodness is infidelity; and <lb/>
<pb n="179" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0194"/>
from this gulf of infidelity Wordsworth was saved by his <lb/>
sister's influence. This was the first memorable service <lb/>
she rendered to his moral nature. He was saved from <reg orig="be-|coming">becoming</reg> <lb/>
permanently soured and narrowed by the sunny <lb/>
radiance of his sister's sympathy and by her unshaken <lb/>
faith that good is stronger than evil. The brother and <lb/>
sister now resolved to live together; and from that hour <lb/>
Dorothy's whole life was given to enrich and solace that <lb/>
of her brother, and to help him to give utterance to those <lb/>
great thoughts and words which at last made the whole of <lb/>
England aware that the nation was possessed of another <lb/>
poet.</p>
<p>Wordsworth was now twenty-five years of age; he had <lb/>
passed through his college career at Cambridge and had <lb/>
travelled abroad, and the time had come when it was not <lb/>
unnaturally expected of him that he should settle down to <lb/>
some business or profession that would provide him with <lb/>
an income. Very little had come to the family from <reg orig="in-|heritance">inheritance</reg>, <lb/>
and parents and guardians are not generally <lb/>
disposed to look with lenient indulgence on a penniless <lb/>
young man of twenty-five who shows a disinclination to <lb/>
any steady work, and is suspected of an ambition to <reg orig="be-|come">become</reg> <lb/>
a poet. Wordsworth's uncles had been kind and <lb/>
generous guardians, but they could not have been pleased <lb/>
at what must have seemed to them at this time the dilatory, <lb/>
desultory life of their nephew. His sister, however, all the <lb/>
while gave him her warmest sympathy and support. Before <lb/>
any one else had dreamed of it, she recognised her brother's <lb/>
genius; she not only believed that he would be a poet, but <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">knew</hi> that he <hi rend="italic">was</hi> a poet. She did not urge him, as a <reg orig="well-|intentioned">wellintentioned</reg> <lb/>
but less perceptive friend might have done, to <lb/>
become a lawyer, or a doctor, or what not; she made it <lb/>
possible, by joining her life to his, and nourishing his genius <lb/>
by the tribute she poured into it from her own, that he <lb/>
should have the quiet sympathetic surroundings without <lb/>
which his poetic imagination could not work.</p>
<p>Their slender means were augmented about this time <lb/>
by a legacy which rendered it possible for the brother and <lb/>
<pb n="180" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0195"/>
sister to have a little cottage home together. Here, at <lb/>
Racedown, in Dorsetshire, Wordsworth first began seriously <lb/>
to devote himself to poetry. Their means were so small <lb/>
that the utmost economy was necessary; but Dorothy <lb/>
cheerfully undertook all the household work of cleaning, <lb/>
cooking, making, and mending. She was not one of those <lb/>
who think there is any degradation, either to man or woman, <lb/>
in manual labour. While she was busied with household <lb/>
cares, her brother often worked in their garden; when their <lb/>
digging and cooking were accomplished, they read Italian <lb/>
authors together, or took long walks through the beautiful <lb/>
country in which they had fixed their abode. It must not <lb/>
be thought that Miss Wordsworth was nothing more to her <lb/>
brother than an energetic, economical housekeeper; she <lb/>
was in feeling almost as much a poet as he was. She had <lb/>
the same intense sympathy with nature, the same <reg orig="obser-|vant">observant</reg> <lb/>
eye and loving heart for all the various moods of the <lb/>
beautiful outside world. She had also much of her brother's <lb/>
power of expression, and the same felicity in description. <lb/>
It has been said of her, "Her journals are Wordsworth in <lb/>
prose, just as his poems are Dorothy in verse." <reg orig="Words-|worth">Wordsworth</reg> <lb/>
said of his brother John that he was "a silent poet," <lb/>
and "a poet in everything but words," meaning that he <lb/>
was a poet in feeling and sympathy; but something more <lb/>
than this can be said of Dorothy; she was a prose poet, <lb/>
who might have become a true poet, if she had not felt <lb/>
that she had another vocation. She was her brother's <reg orig="in-|spirer">inspirer</reg> <lb/>
and critic, and what she wrote herself proves that <lb/>
she was worthy to be both. Some passages of her diary <lb/>
are almost identical in thought and observation with <reg orig="sub-|jects">subjects</reg> <lb/>
that Wordsworth has crystallised in immortal verse. <lb/>
On 30th July 1802 we have, for example, in the prose of <lb/>
Dorothy's journal, part of what Wordsworth has given to <lb/>
us in the sonnets on Westminster Bridge and Calais sands. <lb/>
"Left London between five and six o'clock of the morning, <lb/>
outside the Dover coach. A beautiful morning. The City, <lb/>
St. Paul's, with the river, a multitude of little boats, made <lb/>
a beautiful sight as we crossed Westminster Bridge; the <lb/>
<pb n="181" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0196"/>
houses not overhung by their clouds of smoke, were spread <lb/>
out endlessly; yet the sun shone so brightly, with such a <lb/>
pure light, that there was something like the purity of one <lb/>
of Nature's own grand spectacles. Arrived at Calais at <lb/>
four in the morning of 31st July. Delightful walks in <lb/>
the evenings, seeing far off in the west the coast of <lb/>
England like a cloud, crested with Dover Castle, the <lb/>
evening star, and the glory of the sky. The reflections in <lb/>
the water were more beautiful than the sky itself; purple <lb/>
waves brighter than precious stones for ever melting away <lb/>
on the sands." Whoever will compare this with the two <lb/>
sonnets beginning "Earth has not anything to show more <lb/>
fair," and "Fair star of evening, splendour of the West," <lb/>
will see how far it is just to say that Dorothy has given <lb/>
us in prose what Wordsworth has given us in verse. There <lb/>
is a deeper human passion in Wordsworth's verse than <lb/>
Dorothy ever reached in her prose. He would not stand <lb/>
to-day the third in the noble group where Shakespeare and <lb/>
Milton are first and second, if he had not possessed, over <lb/>
and above his subtle sympathy with Nature, sympathy also <lb/>
with the greatest of Nature's works, "man, the heart of <lb/>
man, and human life." In the "Lines composed a few <lb/>
miles above Tintern Abbey," and again in the "Ode on <lb/>
the Intimations of Immortality," Wordsworth speaks of <lb/>
the change which had gradually come in himself from the <lb/>
days when the worship of external nature, "meadow, grove, <lb/>
and stream, the earth and every common sight," was all in <lb/>
all to him, to the time when&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l rend="indent">I have learn'd</l>
<l>To look on nature, not as in the hour</l>
<l>Of thoughtless youth; but hearing oftentimes</l>
<l>The still, sad music of humanity,</l>
<l>Nor harsh nor grating, though of ample power</l>
<l>To chasten and subdue.</l>
</lg></q>
It was here, as it seems, that his sister could not follow <lb/>
him. Perhaps her self-suppression, the very concentration <lb/>
of her devotion to her brother, closed her powers of <reg orig="re-|ceptive">receptive</reg> <lb/>
sympathy for the wider issues of human destiny <lb/>
<pb n="182" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0197"/>
which inspires the most precious of Wordsworth's verse. <lb/>
Whether this be so or not, he saw in her what he once <lb/>
had been and had ceased to be.</p>

<l>My former pleasures in the shooting lights</l>
<l>Of thy wild eyes. Oh! yet a little while</l>
<l>May I behold in thee what I was once,</l>
<l>My dear, dear Sister!</l>
</lg></q>
<p>After Racedown the next residence of Wordsworth and <lb/>
his sister was &lpar;1797&rpar; at Alfoxden, in Somersetshire. Here <lb/>
they were visited by Coleridge and Lamb, and here the <lb/>
"Ancient Mariner" was composed, chiefly by Coleridge, but <lb/>
with the help and by the stimulus of Wordsworth and <lb/>
Dorothy. It was during their residence here that the <lb/>
"Lines written above Tintern Abbey" were composed and <lb/>
published. Racedown and Alfoxden were temporary <reg orig="rest-|ing-places">resting-places</reg> <lb/>
only; Wordsworth and his sister did not make <lb/>
a real home for themselves till they settled in the <reg orig="beauti-|ful">beautiful</reg> <lb/>
lake country of Westmoreland, in 1799. At first they <lb/>
lived in a small cottage, where Dorothy, with the help of <lb/>
one feeble old woman, whom they employed partly out of <lb/>
charity, did all the domestic work. A few years later they <lb/>
removed to the house at Rydal Mount, Grasmere, which <lb/>
will always be associated with their memory, and where <lb/>
the rest of their lives was passed. It has been pointed <lb/>
<pb n="183" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0198"/>
out by Mr. Matthew Arnold that almost all Wordsworth's <lb/>
best work was produced in the ten years between 1798 <lb/>
and 1808. During this time he had achieved no fame; <lb/>
he had gained no audience, as it were, save the very select <lb/>
group of whom the chief members were his sister, Coleridge, <lb/>
and Charles and Mary Lamb. All through this time of <lb/>
the production of Wordsworth's best work, Dorothy <reg orig="con-|tinued">continued</reg> <lb/>
to devote herself to him by the cheerful <reg orig="perform-|ance">performance</reg> <lb/>
of the double duties of domestic drudge and literary <lb/>
companion and critic. She was also his comrade in many <lb/>
long mountain excursions, in which they both delighted. <lb/>
Miss Wordsworth had extraordinary physical strength, <lb/>
which many persons believe she overtaxed by her long <lb/>
walks over moor and mountain. It is certain, however, <lb/>
that her brother delighted in her physical vigour no less <lb/>
than in her mental gifts. He speaks in lines addressed to <lb/>
her of her being "healthy as a shepherd boy," and in other <lb/>
places he often shows that physical feebleness formed no <lb/>
part of his conception of feminine grace. His ideal woman <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l rend="indent">is ruddy, fleet and strong,</l>
<l>And down the rocks can leap along</l>
<l>Like rivulets in May.</l>
</lg></q>
Or again&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>She shall be sportive as the fawn,</l>
<l>That wild with glee across the lawn</l>
<l>Or up the mountain springs.</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>In 1802 the poet married his cousin, Mary Hutchinson, <lb/>
and nothing is more characteristic of Dorothy's sweet and <lb/>
generous nature than the warm, loving welcome which she <lb/>
gave to her brother's wife. She did not know jealousy in <lb/>
love; her love was so perfect that she rejoiced in every <lb/>
addition to her brother's happiness, and did not, as a meaner <lb/>
woman might have done, wish his heart to be vacant of all <lb/>
affection save what he felt for herself. The poet's wife was <lb/>
worthy of such a husband and sister-in-law, and the family <lb/>
life went on in perfect love and harmony, that were only <lb/>
strengthened by the new ties and interests that marriage <lb/>
brought. Wordsworth's children became as dear to Dorothy <lb/>
<pb n="184" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0199"/>
as if they had been her own, and she devoted herself to them <lb/>
so that they learnt to feel that they had in her almost a <lb/>
second mother.</p>
<p>In 1832, Wordsworth then being sixty-two years old <lb/>
and his sister over sixty, Dorothy's health seriously broke <lb/>
down. So much has been said in some of the books about <lb/>
the poet and his sister of the harm resulting to Miss <reg orig="Words-|worth's">Wordsworth's</reg> <lb/>
health from her long walks, that it might have been <lb/>
imagined that she had been the victim of a very premature <lb/>
decline of physical powers. Considering, however, that she <lb/>
was descended from parents both of whom had died young, <lb/>
it is at least doubtful whether her failure of health at the <lb/>
age of sixty can be fairly attributed to her pedestrian feats. <lb/>
Her illness in 1832 culminated in a dangerous attack of <lb/>
brain fever, from which she recovered, but with mental <lb/>
and physical powers permanently enfeebled. Her memory <lb/>
was darkened, and her spirits, once so blithe and gay, <reg orig="be-|came">became</reg> <lb/>
clouded and dull. Wordsworth and his wife tended <lb/>
her with unceasing devotion. One who knew them well <lb/>
wrote of Wordsworth at this time that "There is always <lb/>
something very touching in his way of speaking of his <lb/>
sister. The tones of his voice become very gentle and <lb/>
solemn, and he ceases to have that flow of expression <lb/>
which is so remarkable in him on all other subjects." <lb/>
The same friend wrote, "Those who know what they <lb/>
&lpar;William and Dorothy Wordsworth&rpar; were to each other <lb/>
can well understand what it must have been to him to see <lb/>
that soul of life and light obscured."</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the delicate health from which she <lb/>
suffered before the close of her life, she outlived her <lb/>
brother for five years. He died on 23d April 1850, <lb/>
the anniversary of Shakespeare's birth and death. His <lb/>
sister at first could hardly comprehend her loss; but when <lb/>
at last she understood that her heart's best treasure was <lb/>
no more, she exclaimed that there was nothing left worth <lb/>
living for. It was hardly life to live without him to whom <lb/>
her own life had been devoted. The friends surrounding <lb/>
her dreaded the shock which this great loss would be to <lb/>
<pb n="185" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0200"/>
her, but she bore it with unexpected calmness. A friend <lb/>
wrote, "She is drawn about as usual in her chair. She <lb/>
was heard to say as she passed the door where the body <lb/>
lay, 'O Death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy <lb/>
victory?'" She died in January 1855, and was buried by <lb/>
her brother's side in Grasmere Churchyard.</p>

SISTER DORA</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">One</hi> of the most remarkable women who, in recent times, <lb/>
have devoted themselves to nursing and to the service of <lb/>
the sick poor, was Dorothy Wyndlaw Pattison, more <lb/>
generally known by the name of Sister Dora. She was <lb/>
a lady born and bred, well-educated, high-spirited, <reg orig="sweet-|tempered">sweettempered</reg>, <lb/>
and handsome; full of fun and sense of humour, <lb/>
fond of hunting and other athletic exercises, and remarkably <lb/>
fond of her own way. As her own way was generally a <lb/>
good way, she was probably right in preferring it to the <lb/>
ways of other people. Strong determination, when it does <lb/>
not degenerate into stupid obstinacy, is one of the most <lb/>
useful qualities any human being can have. In Sister <lb/>
Dora's case her strong will was a great secret of her success, <lb/>
but it also, in a few instances, led her into errors, which <lb/>
will easily be seen as the story of her life is told.</p>
<p>She was born, in 1832, at Hauxwell, in Yorkshire, a <lb/>
small village on the slope of a hill, looking towards the <lb/>
moors and Wensleydale. Her father was the clergyman of <lb/>
the village, and one of her brothers was the Rev. Mark <lb/>
Pattison, the well-known scholar and the Rector of Lincoln <lb/>
College, Oxford. Dorothy Pattison was first roused to <lb/>
wish for something more than the ordinary occupations of <lb/>
a young lady's life by the enthusiasm felt throughout <lb/>
England in 1856 for Miss Florence Nightingale's work in <lb/>
<pb n="187" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0202"/>
the Crimea. Dorothy wished to join Miss Nightingale's <lb/>
band of lady nurses at the seat of war, but her parents' <lb/>
opposition and her own want of training prevented her <lb/>
from carrying out this wish. From this time, however, <lb/>
she fretted against the life of comparative inactivity to <lb/>
which she was restricted so long as she remained in her <lb/>
village home. Some years were passed &lpar;wasted, we well <lb/>
may think&rpar; in unnecessary friction between herself and her <lb/>
father, she desiring to leave home, and he opposing her <lb/>
wishes in this respect. At last she did leave, in 1861, <lb/>
more or less in face of her father's opposition; he declined <lb/>
to make her any allowance beyond what he had been <lb/>
accustomed to give her for pocket-money and clothes, and <lb/>
she had therefore to live partly on what she was able to <lb/>
earn. She obtained work as a village schoolmistress at <lb/>
Little Woolston, near Bletchley, and lived for three years <lb/>
in a small cottage, quite alone, without even a servant; <lb/>
her life at this time must have been very much like that <lb/>
described in <hi rend="italic">Jane Eyre,</hi> where the heroine gains her <lb/>
livelihood for a time by similar work. She showed, as a <lb/>
village schoolmistress, that keen sympathy with children <lb/>
and power over them which always distinguished her. <lb/>
She could enter, through her bright imagination, into the <lb/>
feelings and thoughts of children, and her playfulness and <lb/>
love of fun made her a real friend and companion to them. <lb/>
At Little Woolston, too, she did a good deal of amateur <lb/>
nursing for the parents and friends of her little pupils. <lb/>
Her biographer, Miss Lonsdale,<ref target="n5" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref>
<note id="n5" place="foot" n="1"><seg type="note-symbol"><hi rend="super">1</hi></seg><p><hi rend="italic">Sister Dora: a Biography.</hi> By Margaret Lonsdale.</p></note>
 says that the people in the <lb/>
neighbourhood of the village were very quick to discover <lb/>
that the new schoolmistress was a real lady, but for some time <lb/>
they could not get over their astonishment if they found Miss <lb/>
Pattison blacking her own grate when they came to see her. <lb/>
She was, perhaps, the first instance they had come across <lb/>
of a cultivated woman who thought that "being a lady" <lb/>
was not inconsistent with working hard. Dirtiness, <reg orig="untidi-|ness">untidiness</reg>, <lb/>
and muddle vex the soul of the "real lady" far more <lb/>
than doing the work which produces cleanliness and order.</p>
<pb n="188" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0203"/>
<p>After three years at Little Woolston, Miss Pattison <lb/>
made what many must think was the great mistake of her <lb/>
life. Her strong will has already been spoken of; she <lb/>
had found by experience that she could not submit it even <lb/>
to the control of her own father, to whom she was naturally <lb/>
bound by strong feelings of affection. It was necessary to <lb/>
her to have freedom and scope for her energies, and to <lb/>
learn by self-government what she had failed to learn <lb/>
through the government of others. Notwithstanding the <lb/>
incompatibility of her nature with the absolute submission <lb/>
required in such institutions, Miss Pattison joined a High <lb/>
Church Sisterhood, at Coatham, called the Sisterhood of <lb/>
the Good Samaritan. It was part of the discipline of the <lb/>
sisterhood to require unquestioning obedience to all <lb/>
commands. The reason, the feelings, the natural piety of <lb/>
the novices were completely subordinated to obedience as <lb/>
their first and paramount duty. By way of training in <lb/>
unquestioning obedience, Sister Dora, as she was now called, <lb/>
was subjected to various tests of submissiveness; one day, <lb/>
for instance, after she had made all the beds, they were <lb/>
pulled to pieces again by the order of the Superior, and she <lb/>
was told to make them again. In some institutions of this <lb/>
kind, after the floor has been carefully and thoroughly <lb/>
scrubbed by a novice, some one enters, by order of the <lb/>
Superior, with mud or ashes, and purposely makes it dirty <lb/>
again; the novice is then ordered to return to her work <lb/>
and scrub the floor once more, and she is expected to do <lb/>
so without showing the least sign of disappointment or <lb/>
annoyance. It may be true that this system fosters the <lb/>
habit of unquestioning obedience, but if so it must be at <lb/>
the expense of other and more valuable qualities. This <lb/>
unnatural system is perverting to the moral sense and <lb/>
judgment, as Sister Dora, a few years later, found to her <lb/>
cost.</p>
<p>In 1865 she was sent by the sisterhood to Walsall, to <lb/>
take part in the nursing in a small cottage hospital. <lb/>
Towards the end of the year she received orders from the <lb/>
sisterhood to leave this work and take work as a nurse in <lb/>
<pb n="189" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0204"/>
a private case in the South of England. Walsall had not <lb/>
been trained to habits of unquestioning obedience; its <lb/>
inhabitants and the managers of the little hospital had <lb/>
already discovered Sister Dora's fine qualities as a nurse. <lb/>
They resisted the order that would have deprived them of <lb/>
her services. While negotiations on this subject were <lb/>
proceeding between the Walsall people and the sisterhood <lb/>
at Coatham, news reached Miss Pattison from Hauxwell, <lb/>
to say that her father was dangerously ill and much desired <lb/>
to see her. She telegraphed to the sisterhood, telling them <lb/>
of her father's serious illness, and asking permission to visit <lb/>
him. The answer, which was returned almost immediately, <lb/>
was a blank refusal, and she was bidden to proceed at once <lb/>
to Devonshire to nurse a stranger. Incredible as this may <lb/>
seem, it is still more incredible that the order was obeyed. <lb/>
Miss Pattison had not escaped the paralysis of moral sense <lb/>
which this cast-iron system produces; she turned her back <lb/>
on her home and proceeded to Devonshire. Her father <lb/>
died almost immediately, without ever seeing his daughter <lb/>
again. The shock of this event roused Sister Dora from <lb/>
the lethargy from which she had suffered. She was almost <lb/>
broken-hearted, and deeply resented the dictation to which <lb/>
she had been subjected. She ought to have seen, and <lb/>
probably did see, that the will, like all other powers of the <lb/>
mind and body, with which each one of us is endowed, is <lb/>
given to us to be used; we are responsible for its right use, <lb/>
and when we use it wrongly, as she did in this case &lpar;for it <lb/>
must have needed a very strong effort of will to resist the <lb/>
appeal of love and duty&rpar;, it is we ourselves who must bear the <lb/>
punishment and endure the anguish of our fault. She did <lb/>
not immediately sever her connection with the sisterhood, <lb/>
but she began from that time to be less completely in <lb/>
thraldom to it. She finally quitted it in 1875, under <lb/>
circumstances which have not been made public. When a <lb/>
friend questioned her as to the cause, Sister Dora's only <lb/>
reply was, "I am a woman, and not a piece of furniture."</p>
<p>After her father's death, Sister Dora returned to Walsall, <lb/>
and in this place practically the whole of the rest of her <lb/>
<pb n="190" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0205"/>
life was devoted to the service of the sick and of all who <lb/>
were desolate and oppressed. She plunged into her work <lb/>
with all the greater eagerness from her desire to forget <lb/>
herself and the many inward troubles and anxieties which <lb/>
oppressed her at this time. Her great desire was to become <lb/>
a first-rate surgical nurse. Walsall has been described by <lb/>
those who lived there as "one of the smokiest dens of the <lb/>
Black Country," and the workers in the various factories of <lb/>
the locality were often frightfully injured by accidents with <lb/>
the machinery, or by burns and scalds. Sister Dora <lb/>
became marvellously skilful in what is known as "<reg orig="con-|servative">conservative</reg> <lb/>
surgery," that is, the art of saving a maimed and <lb/>
crushed limb instead of cutting it off. A good old doctor <lb/>
at the hospital taught her all he knew; but she outgrew <lb/>
his instructions, and Miss Lonsdale gives an instance of a <lb/>
case in which Sister Dora saved a man's right arm from <lb/>
amputation, in spite of the doctor's strongly expressed <lb/>
opinion that the man would die unless his arm were taken <lb/>
off immediately. The arm was frightfully torn and twisted; <lb/>
the doctor said it must be taken off, or mortification would <lb/>
set in. Sister Dora said she could save the arm, and the <lb/>
man's life too. The patient was appealed to, and of the <lb/>
two risks he chose the one offered by the Sister. The <lb/>
doctor did not fail, proud as he was of his pupil, to remind <lb/>
her that the responsibility of what he considered the <lb/>
patient's certain death would be on her head. She accepted <lb/>
the responsibility, and devoted herself to her patient almost <lb/>
night and day for three weeks, with the result that the arm <lb/>
was saved. The doctor was the first generously to <lb/>
acknowledge her triumph, and he brought the rest of his <lb/>
medical colleagues to see what Sister Dora had done. The <lb/>
patient's gratitude was unbounded; he often revisited the <lb/>
hospital simply to inquire for Sister Dora. He was known <lb/>
in the neighbourhood as "Sister's Arm." During an illness <lb/>
she had, this man used to walk every Sunday morning <lb/>
eleven miles to the hospital to inquire for her. He would <lb/>
say, "How's Sister?" and on receiving a reply would add, <lb/>
"Tell her it's <hi rend="italic">her arm</hi> that rang the bell," and walk back <lb/>
<pb n="191" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0206"/>
again. Sister Dora used to say when speaking of her <lb/>
period of suspense and anxiety in this case, "How I prayed <lb/>
over that arm!"</p>
<p>She was particularly skilful in her treatment of burns; <lb/>
sometimes she would take two poor little burnt or scalded <lb/>
babies to sleep in her own room. Those who have had <lb/>
experience in the surgical wards of hospitals know what <lb/>
an overpowering and sickening smell proceeds from burnt <lb/>
flesh. Sister Dora never seemed for a moment to think <lb/>
of herself or of what was disagreeable and disgusting in <lb/>
such cases as these. In one frightful accident in which <lb/>
eleven poor men were so badly burned that they resembled <lb/>
charred logs of wood more than human beings, nearly all <lb/>
the doctors and nurses became sick and faint a few minutes <lb/>
after they entered the ward where the sufferers lay, and <lb/>
were obliged to leave. Among the nurses Sister Dora <lb/>
alone remained at her post, and never ceased night or day <lb/>
for ten days to do all that human skill could suggest to <lb/>
alleviate the sufferings of the poor victims. Some died <lb/>
almost immediately, some lingered for a week or ten <lb/>
days; only two ultimately recovered. Her wonderful <lb/>
courage was shown not only in her readiness to accept <lb/>
responsibility, but in the way in which she was able to <lb/>
keep up her own spirits, and to raise the spirits of the <lb/>
patients through such a time of trial as this. She would <lb/>
laugh and joke, and tell the sick folks stories, or do <reg orig="any-|thing">anything</reg> <lb/>
that would help them to while away the time and <lb/>
bear their sufferings with fortitude and courage. She <lb/>
made her patients feel how much she cared for them, <lb/>
and that all she did for them was a pleasure, not a <lb/>
trouble. She used to provide them with a little bell, <lb/>
which she told them to ring when they wanted her. One <lb/>
poor man was reproached by the other patients for <reg orig="ring-|ing">ringing</reg> <lb/>
his bell so often, especially as when Sister Dora <reg orig="ar-|rived">arrived</reg> <lb/>
and asked him what he wanted, he not infrequently <lb/>
answered that he did not know. But Sister Dora never <lb/>
reproached him for ringing too often. "Never mind," she <lb/>
would say brightly, "for I like to hear it;" and she told <lb/>
<pb n="192" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0207"/>
him that she often fancied when she was asleep that she <lb/>
heard his little bell, and started up in a hurry to find it <lb/>
was only a dream. She was so gay and bright and <reg orig="plea-|sant">pleasant</reg> <lb/>
in her ways, giving her patients comical nicknames, <lb/>
and caressing and coaxing them almost as a mother would <lb/>
a sick child, that they regarded her with a deep love and <lb/>
veneration that frequently influenced them for good all the <lb/>
rest of their lives. Twice while she was at Walsall, there <lb/>
were frightful epidemics of small-pox, and on both occasions <lb/>
she showed extraordinary courage and devotion. She did <lb/>
not bear any charm against infection, and in fact generally <lb/>
caught anything that was to be caught in the way of <reg orig="in-|fectious">infectious</reg> <lb/>
disease. Her courage, therefore, did not proceed <lb/>
from any confidence in her own immunity from danger. <lb/>
She deliberately counted the cost, and resolved to pay it, <lb/>
for the sake of carrying on her work. At the first <reg orig="out-|break">outbreak</reg> <lb/>
of small-pox in Walsall there was no proper hospital <lb/>
accommodation for the patients; and Sister Dora nursed <lb/>
many of them in the overcrowded courts and alleys where <lb/>
they lived. She was called in to one poor man who was <lb/>
dying of a virulent form of the malady known as "<reg orig="black-|pox">blackpox</reg>." <lb/>
He was a frightful object: all his friends and <reg orig="re-|lations">relations</reg>, <lb/>
except one woman, had forsaken him; when Sister <lb/>
Dora arrived, she found there was only one small piece of <lb/>
candle in the house, so she gave the woman money to go <lb/>
out and buy candles, and other necessaries. The <reg orig="tempta-|tion">temptation</reg> <lb/>
was too much for the poor woman, who must, after <lb/>
all, have been better than the patient's other relatives and <lb/>
neighbours, for she had stayed with him when they had <lb/>
run away. But when the professional nurse arrived and <lb/>
gave her money, she ran away too, and Sister Dora was <lb/>
left quite alone with the dying man. Just as the one bit <lb/>
of candle flickered out, the poor man, covered as he was <lb/>
with the terrible disease, raised himself in bed and said, <lb/>
"Kiss me, Sister." She did so, and the man sank back; <lb/>
she promised she would not leave him while he was alive, <lb/>
and his last hours were soothed by her presence. She <lb/>
passed hours by his side in total darkness, uncertain <lb/>
<pb n="193" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0208"/>
whether he were dead or alive; at last the gray light of <lb/>
early dawn came, and she was at liberty. Her promise <lb/>
was fulfilled; the man was dead.</p>
<p>At the second outbreak of small-pox at Walsall, hospital <lb/>
accommodation was provided for the patients; and the <lb/>
ambulance, a sort of omnibus fitted up to convey a patient <lb/>
and nurse, was frequently to be seen in the streets. Sister <lb/>
Dora was as strong as she was courageous; she would come <lb/>
to a house where a small-pox patient lay, and say she had <lb/>
"come for" so-and-so. Resistance and excuses were no <lb/>
good; she would take the patient, man or woman, in her <lb/>
arms as easily as she would a baby, and carry the burden <lb/>
down to the ambulance. Her presence cheered the whole <lb/>
town, and prevented the spread of that dastardly panic <lb/>
which sometimes comes over a place which is stricken by <lb/>
disease. An eye-witness described how every one in the <lb/>
town felt new courage at the sight of the ambulance and <lb/>
Sister Dora, "with her jolly face smiling out of the <lb/>
window."</p>
<p>She spent six months at the small-pox hospital in 1875; <lb/>
and for a long time she was practically alone there with <lb/>
the patients; the doctors of course came by day, and three <lb/>
of her old patients constantly visited the hospital for the <lb/>
sake of seeing if they could do anything for her; and there <lb/>
were two nearly helpless old women from the workhouse, <lb/>
who were supposed to do part of the work; but she was <lb/>
absolutely alone as regards regular skilful assistance in the <lb/>
nursing and other work. The porter did what he could, <lb/>
showing his devotion by getting up early to scrub and <lb/>
clean for her; but he could hardly ever resist the <reg orig="tempta-|tion">temptation</reg> <lb/>
to go off "on the drink" whenever his wages were <lb/>
paid; on these occasions he would absent himself for four <lb/>
and twenty hours at a time. Once when this had happened, <lb/>
and Sister Dora was quite alone, a delirious patient, a tall, <lb/>
powerful man, flung himself out of bed in the middle of the <lb/>
night, and rushed to the door trying to make his escape. <lb/>
"She had no time for hesitation, but at once grappled <lb/>
with him, all covered as he was with the loathsome disease <lb/>
<pb n="194" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0209"/>
&hellip; she got him back to bed, and held him there by <lb/>
main force till the doctor arrived in the morning."</p>
<p>One of the trials of her work was that the small-pox <lb/>
patients were nearly all "alive" with vermin; added to <lb/>
this was the horror of the all-pervading smell of pox; in <lb/>
a letter to a friend, Sister Dora spoke of this, and said it <lb/>
was impossible to get away from it. "I taste it in my <lb/>
tea!" For months she never had her bonnet on, or went <lb/>
even as far as the gate; and yet she was able to look back <lb/>
on the time she spent in this hospital as one that had been <lb/>
very much blessed to her. With her High Church feelings <lb/>
about Lent, she wrote cheerfully in the letter already quoted, <lb/>
"Is not this a glorious retreat for me in Lent? I can have <lb/>
no idle chatter." In another letter, she wrote, "I am still <lb/>
a prisoner, surrounded by my lepers. I do feel so thankful <lb/>
that I came. &hellip; I thank God daily for my life here."</p>
<p>Endless instances might be given of her physical and <lb/>
moral courage; once, when she was in a third-class railway <lb/>
carriage with a lot of rough navvies, who were swearing and <lb/>
using horrible language, she boldly reproved them; they <lb/>
laid hands on her, one of them exclaiming, "Hold your <lb/>
jaw, you fool; do you want your face smashed in?" She <lb/>
remained quite calm, not struggling, although they were <lb/>
holding her down on the seat between them. When the <lb/>
train reached a station, they let her go, and she got out of <lb/>
the carriage, and one of the men begged her pardon, saying, <lb/>
"Shake hands, mum! you're a good plucked one, you are; <lb/>
you were right, and we were wrong." Another time in the <lb/>
hospital, a half-drunken man, flashily dressed, rang the bell <lb/>
in the night, and on the door being opened forced his way <lb/>
into the hall, and demanded a bed. The night nurse on <lb/>
duty was unable to get rid of him, and Sister Dora was <lb/>
summoned. The man reiterated his determination to stay <lb/>
all night, and Sister Dora contented herself with barring <lb/>
his access to the patients by standing erect on the last step <lb/>
of the stairs with her arms spread from the wall to the <lb/>
balusters. The man seated himself opposite to her, the <lb/>
nurse fled shrieking, and the two waited, staring at one <lb/>
<pb n="195" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0210"/>
another, each hoping the other would be the first to tire of <lb/>
the situation. Presently the man made a rush down the <lb/>
passage towards the kitchen door, but Sister Dora was too <lb/>
quick for him, and by the time he had reached it she was <lb/>
there with her arms spread across it, as on the stairs, to bar <lb/>
his way. She expected he would knock her down, but <reg orig="in-|stead">instead</reg> <lb/>
of doing so he muttered some compliment to her <lb/>
courage, and turned on his heel and left the place.</p>
<p>She had a very strong personal influence for good on <lb/>
the poor rough people, both men and women, for whom <lb/>
she worked. Her religion was one more of deeds than of <lb/>
words, and they saw that both in word and deed it was <lb/>
genuine. Many a one has dated a new start in life from <lb/>
the time he came under her care. Sometimes patients, <lb/>
waking in the night, would find her praying by their <reg orig="bed-|sides">bedsides</reg>, <lb/>
and it touched them deeply to see how sincerely and <lb/>
truly she cared for them. Although she had the hearty <lb/>
sense of fun already alluded to, no man could ever venture <lb/>
on a coarse word or jest in her presence, and she inspired <lb/>
a good "tone" in the wards even when they were occupied <lb/>
by the roughest and poorest. As time went on there was <lb/>
hardly a slum or court in the lowest part of Walsall where <lb/>
she was not known, and hardly a creature in the town that <lb/>
did not feel he owed something to her. Although most of <lb/>
her time was given to healing bodily troubles, all her patients <lb/>
felt that she cared for something higher in them than their <lb/>
bodies. She joined heartily in several missions that were <lb/>
started with the object of reaching the lowest and most <lb/>
outcast; she would go quite fearlessly at midnight into <lb/>
the haunts of the most degraded men and women of the <lb/>
town, and induce them, for a while at least, to pause and <lb/>
consider what their lives had been given to them for. <lb/>
Once, we are told, when she was on her way to a patient's <lb/>
house at night, she had to pass through one of the worst <lb/>
slums of the town. A man ran out of a notorious <reg orig="public-|house">publichouse</reg> <lb/>
and said, "Sister, you're wanted; they've been <reg orig="fight-|ing">fighting</reg>, <lb/>
and a man's hurt desperate." Even she hesitated <lb/>
momentarily, and the thought passed through her mind <lb/>
<pb n="196" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0211"/>
that she might be murdered. But her hesitation did not <lb/>
last sufficiently long to be visible; she followed the man <reg orig="im-|mediately">immediately</reg>, <lb/>
taking comfort characteristically in the thought, <lb/>
"What does it matter if I am murdered?" To her <reg orig="aston-|ishment">astonishment</reg>, <lb/>
as soon as she reached the group of men, brutalised <lb/>
apparently almost below the level of humanity, a way was <lb/>
respectfully made for her, and every hat was taken off as <lb/>
she passed to the side of the wounded man.</p>
<p>But the time was approaching when the hand of death <lb/>
was to be laid upon this wonderful woman in the midst of <lb/>
all her labours. She was only about forty-four years of <lb/>
age, when she discovered that she was stricken by an <reg orig="in-|curable">incurable</reg> <lb/>
and terribly painful disease. It was a sign both of <lb/>
her strength and of her weakness that she insisted on <reg orig="keep-|ing">keeping</reg> <lb/>
this fact absolutely secret. She, who had always been <lb/>
so strong, could not bear to acknowledge that her strength <lb/>
had come to an end. She, who had been so ready to give <lb/>
sympathy, could not bear to accept it. She went on with <lb/>
her work, bearing her pain silently and proudly, and <reg orig="admit-|ting">admitting</reg> <lb/>
no one to her confidence. In order more completely <lb/>
to conceal her illness, she left Walsall for a time; and those <lb/>
who remained in charge of the hospital did not dream but <lb/>
that her absence was merely temporary. With the <reg orig="know-|ledge">knowledge</reg> <lb/>
that her days on earth were numbered, she still went <lb/>
on studying her profession. She attended some of Professor <lb/>
Lister's operations in London in order to become acquainted <lb/>
with his antiseptic process, and she went to the Paris <reg orig="Exhibi-|tion">Exhibition</reg> <lb/>
especially to study the surgical appliances shown there. <lb/>
Then presently she came back to Walsall, in October 1878. <lb/>
In November of the same year the Mayor opened a new <lb/>
hospital in her name; she was too ill to be present. Up <lb/>
to the last the townspeople could not believe that their <lb/>
"dear lady" was really to be taken from them, especially <lb/>
as her vitality was so strong that she rallied again and <lb/>
again, when those about her thought that the end was <lb/>
near at hand. She never lost her old habit of joking and <lb/>
making fun out of the dismal circumstances of sickness. <lb/>
Her arm, which became terribly swollen and helpless, she <lb/>
<pb n="197" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0212"/>
nicknamed "Sir Roger," and she laughed at her doctors <lb/>
because she lived longer than they had predicted she would. <lb/>
She quite chuckled over the idea that she had "done the <lb/>
doctor again." Her life was prolonged till 24th December <lb/>
1878. The grief throughout the district when it was known <lb/>
that death had removed her was overpowering. The <reg orig="venera-|tion">veneration</reg> <lb/>
and gratitude of the whole town found expression in <lb/>
many schemes for memorials in her honour. The working <lb/>
people wished most of all for a statue of their dear lady. <lb/>
The wish was gratified, through Miss Lonsdale's generous <lb/>
aid, in the autumn of 1886. A pure white marble statue <lb/>
now stands in a central position of the smoky town of <lb/>
Walsall, commemorating the life and labours of one of the <lb/>
best of this generation of Englishwomen. Her work is <lb/>
another illustration of the text, "He that is greatest among <lb/>
you, shall be your servant."</p>

MRS. BARBAULD</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Anne Letitia Barbauld</hi> will probably be more <reg orig="re-|membered">remembered</reg> <lb/>
for what she was than for what she did. At a <lb/>
time when women's education was at a very low ebb, and <lb/>
when for a woman to be an authoress was to single herself <lb/>
out for ungenerous sneers, attacks, and insinuations, Mrs. <lb/>
Barbauld did much to raise the social esteem in which <lb/>
literary women were held, and prove in her own person <lb/>
that a popular authoress could be a devoted wife, daughter, <lb/>
and sister.</p>
<p>Mrs. Barbauld's father was the Rev. John Aikin, a <lb/>
Doctor of Divinity, much esteemed in Nonconformist circles <lb/>
for his learning and piety. He was for nearly thirty years <lb/>
the head of a well-known Nonconformist college at <reg orig="War-|rington">Warrington</reg>, <lb/>
round which a little knot of learned and good <lb/>
men gathered, who, it is said, did much to raise the tone, <lb/>
intellectually and morally, of English society at a time <lb/>
when Oxford and Cambridge were sunk in the deepest <lb/>
lethargy, and had comparatively no influence for good in <lb/>
any direction. Among the men, whose names afterwards <lb/>
became honourably known, who were connected with the <lb/>
social or educational life of the Warrington Academy, may <lb/>
be mentioned Dr. Priestley, Dr. Enfield, the Rev. Gilbert <lb/>
Wakefield, Howard the philanthropist, and Roscoe the <lb/>
historian. In the midst of a society tempered by such good <lb/>
<pb n="199" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0214"/>
influences as these, Anne Letitia Aikin grew from girlhood <lb/>
to womanhood. She and her brother, John Aikin, four <lb/>
years younger than herself, were the only children of their <lb/>
parents. She was born at Kibworth, in Leicestershire, on <lb/>
20th June 1743, where her father had a school before he <lb/>
became the head of the Warrington Academy. Her mother <lb/>
is said to have come to the singular conclusion that a girl <lb/>
brought up in a boys' school must either be a prude or a <lb/>
tomboy, and Mrs. Aikin preferred the former. Judging <lb/>
from a cameo portrait of Mrs. Barbauld, taken at the <lb/>
request of her friend Josiah Wedgwood, she certainly looks <lb/>
as if a good deal of her time had been spent in the <reg orig="enuncia-|tion">enunciation</reg> <lb/>
of the words "prunes, prisms, and propriety." But <lb/>
appearances are notoriously deceptive, and there is a nice <lb/>
little story of Mrs. Barbauld's girlhood, which shows that <lb/>
her excellent mother did not succeed in entirely eradicating <lb/>
the tomboy element from her daughter's character. When <lb/>
only fifteen years old, Anne had attracted the affections of <lb/>
a Kibworth farmer, who made a formal application to Dr. <lb/>
Aikin for his daughter's hand. The Doctor, seeing his <lb/>
daughter in the garden, gave the suitor leave to go and try <lb/>
his fortunes. When she understood the nature of his <lb/>
errand, her embarrassment was very great, for the dilemma <lb/>
presented itself of having to say "No," and yet to spare the <lb/>
feelings of the swain; finding no other way out of the <lb/>
difficulty, she ran up a tree, thus gaining the top of the <lb/>
garden wall, and then, by one spring, the lane on the other <lb/>
side, leaving her discomfited lover to admire her agility and <lb/>
bewail its results.</p>
<p>Anne was from her birth an extraordinarily precocious <lb/>
child. Her mother wrote of her in after years, comparing <lb/>
her with some less wonderful grandchildren, "I once, <reg orig="in-|deed">indeed</reg>, <lb/>
knew a little girl who was as eager to learn as her <lb/>
instructors could be to teach her, and who, at two years old, <lb/>
could read sentences and little stories in her <hi rend="italic">wise book,</hi> <lb/>
roundly, without spelling, and in half a year more could <lb/>
read as well as most women; but I never knew such <lb/>
another, and I believe never shall." Her father shared <lb/>
<pb n="200" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0215"/>
sufficiently in the prejudices of the period to refuse for a <lb/>
long time to impart to this gifted child any of the classical <lb/>
learning of which he was the master, and in which she <lb/>
ardently desired to share. At length she so far overcame <lb/>
his scruples that she became able to read Latin with facility, <lb/>
and gained some acquaintance with Greek. The fact that <lb/>
her father was a schoolmaster no doubt enabled her to enjoy <lb/>
many opportunities of instruction and education to which <lb/>
the bulk of Englishwomen at that time were complete <lb/>
strangers. At a time when it was thought enough <reg orig="educa-|tion">education</reg> <lb/>
for most women if they were able to read, "and <reg orig="per-|haps">perhaps</reg> <lb/>
to write their names or so," it is not surprising if <reg orig="school-|masters">schoolmasters</reg>' <lb/>
daughters enjoyed an advantage in being able at <lb/>
least to pick up the crumbs that fell from the rich man's table.</p>
<p>Anne was thirty years of age before she made her first <lb/>
appearance in print with a volume of verse in 1773; but <lb/>
she appears to have been known as a poet in her own circle <lb/>
of friends a few years earlier than this, as there is a letter <lb/>
in existence from Dr. Priestley, dated 1769, in which he asks <lb/>
permission to send a copy of her poem, called "Corsica," <lb/>
to Boswell, who was destined to future immortality as the <lb/>
biographer of Dr. Johnson. Her first printed volume was <lb/>
highly successful, and passed through four editions almost <lb/>
immediately. Thus, encouraged, Anne and her brother <lb/>
shortly afterwards printed a joint-volume, called <hi rend="italic"><reg orig="Miscel-|laneous">Miscellaneous</reg> <lb/>
Pieces in Prose,</hi> which also attracted much <reg orig="atten-|tion">attention</reg> <lb/>
and commendation. In Rogers's <hi rend="italic">Table Talk</hi> an anecdote <lb/>
is given about this volume which illustrates the amusing <lb/>
mistakes sometimes arising from joint authorship. The <lb/>
various articles in the book were not signed by their <lb/>
respective authors, and on one occasion Charles James Fox, <lb/>
meeting John Aikin at a dinner party, wished to <reg orig="compli-|ment">compliment</reg> <lb/>
him on his book. "I particularly admire," he said, <lb/>
"your essay, 'Against Inconsistency in our Expectations.'" <lb/>
"That," replied Aikin, "is my sister's." "I much like," <lb/>
returned Fox, "your essay on Monastic Institutions." <lb/>
"That" answered Aikin, "is also my sister's." Fox thought <lb/>
it best to say no more about the book.</p>
<pb n="201" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0216"/>
<p>In the same year as that of the publication of this volume <lb/>
of Essays, 1774, Anne Letitia Aikin became the wife of the <lb/>
Rev. Rochemont Barbauld, a descendant of a French <reg orig="Pro-|testant">Protestant</reg> <lb/>
family. Mr. Barbauld's father had been chaplain <lb/>
to the Electress of Hesse Cassel, a daughter of George II, <lb/>
and the son had been intended for the Church of England. <lb/>
He had, however, conscientious objections to taking orders <lb/>
in that Church, and joined the Presbyterian body. Miss <lb/>
Aikin was warned before her marriage that her future <lb/>
husband had suffered already from an attack of insanity, <lb/>
but with Quixotic devotion this only seemed to her an <lb/>
additional reason why she should unite her life with his. <lb/>
Her married life, notwithstanding many good qualities on <lb/>
her husband's part, was one of exceptional trial and loneliness. <lb/>
Mr. Barbauld was liable throughout his life to fits of insanity, <lb/>
which took the form of fierce and uncontrollable fury as <lb/>
often as not directed against his wife. They settled at <lb/>
Palgrave in Suffolk, and opened a boys' school there. Mrs. <lb/>
Barbauld was much urged by her friend Mrs. Montague to <lb/>
open a school for girls, for the purpose of imparting to <lb/>
them, in a regular manner, various branches of science, such <lb/>
as did not then form an ordinary part of women's education. <lb/>
Mrs. Barbauld declined the task, giving various excuses, <lb/>
such as her own want of proficiency in music and dancing, <lb/>
and other feminine accomplishments. It may, however, be <lb/>
not improbable that her real reason was one that could not <lb/>
be avowed, and was to be found in the mental condition of <lb/>
her husband. It must have been a sufficiently severe trial <lb/>
to the strongest nerves to keep a boys' school, and to know <lb/>
that the head master and principal teacher was at any time <lb/>
liable to fits of insane fury; but this would have been even <lb/>
worse, it would have been a fatal objection, in a girls' school. <lb/>
Poor Mrs. Barbauld set herself with pathetic resolution to <lb/>
make the best of the partner and the life she had chosen. <lb/>
She seems immediately to have assumed she would never <lb/>
have any children of her own, for within a year of her <lb/>
marriage she adopted from his birth her nephew Charles, <lb/>
her brother's son. This was the little Charles from whom <lb/>
<pb n="202" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0217"/>
<hi rend="italic">The Early Lessons</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Hymns in Prose</hi> were written. Very <lb/>
few educational books for young children had then <lb/>
been written, and Mrs. Barbauld set herself to supply the <lb/>
deficiency. She discovered from practical experience the <lb/>
sort of books children learn best from, and the kind of <lb/>
paper and type that suited them best. Many of her friends <lb/>
in the literary world thought she was wasting her talents <lb/>
in such employment. Dr. Johnson is recorded in Boswell's <lb/>
life to have spoken very scornfully of what she was doing, <lb/>
and set it all down to her having married a "little <reg orig="Presby-|terian">Presbyterian</reg> <lb/>
parson." It appears, however, in the anecdotes of <lb/>
Johnson, collected by Mrs. Thrale, that though he might <lb/>
have spoken in this way at times, his warm heart did not <lb/>
fail to appreciate the devotion of Mrs. Barbauld's talents to <lb/>
the humble tasks which her marriage had rendered necessary. <lb/>
"Mrs. Barbauld," Mrs. Thrale wrote, "had his best praise, <lb/>
and deserved it; no man was more struck than Mr. Johnson <lb/>
with the voluntary descent from possible splendour to <reg orig="pain-|ful">painful</reg> <lb/>
duty." She wrote herself in her preface to <hi rend="italic">The Early <lb/>
Lessons:</hi> "The task is humble, but not mean, for to lay <lb/>
the first stone of a noble building and to plant the first <lb/>
idea in a human mind can be no dishonour to any hand."</p>
<p>The school at Palgrave was successful mainly through <lb/>
Mrs. Barbauld's efforts; among the scholars were reckoned <lb/>
many men of future distinction, such as the first Lord <reg orig="Den-|man">Denman</reg> <lb/>
and William Taylor of Norwich. After eleven years of <lb/>
courageous and exhausting work, the school was given up, <lb/>
and Mr. Barbauld undertook the charge of a Presbyterian <lb/>
church at Hampstead. The husband and wife here enjoyed <lb/>
the friendship of Joanna Baillie and her sister, and here <lb/>
some of Mrs. Barbauld's best literary work was done. But <lb/>
the terrible malady which had pursued her husband <lb/>
throughout his life continued to darken their existence. <lb/>
In order to be near her brother, and enjoy the protection <lb/>
and solace of his society, Mrs. Barbauld left Hampstead in <lb/>
1802, and removed to Stoke Newington, where Dr. Aikin <lb/>
then lived. But Mr. Barbauld's mania continued to increase, <lb/>
and after a sudden attack which he made upon his wife <lb/>
<pb n="203" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0218"/>
with a dinner knife, it became obvious that he must be put <lb/>
under restraint. The unhappy man put an end to his own <lb/>
life in 1808. After an interval, Mrs. Barbauld resumed <lb/>
her literary work, bringing out an edition of English Novels <lb/>
in 1810. In the following year she brought out a poem, <lb/>
which she called "1811," very strongly tinged with the <lb/>
despondency which she felt regarding public affairs. She <lb/>
had been bred as a Whig, to hope for great things from <lb/>
the measures of emancipation with which that party had <lb/>
always been identified. Her sympathies were rather with <lb/>
the French Revolution than with the long-continued struggle <lb/>
of England against Napoleon. The poem had a tone of <lb/>
gloom and deep melancholy, which perhaps reflected more <lb/>
of the writer's personal despondency than the circumstances <lb/>
justified. It is not a little curious that a passage in it is <lb/>
credited with having suggested Lord Macaulay's famous <lb/>
prophecy that in years to come a New Zealander "will <lb/>
from a broken arch of Blackfriars Bridge contemplate the <lb/>
ruins of St. Paul's." The poem provoked a coarse and <lb/>
insulting review in the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly,</hi> with which it is to be <lb/>
regretted that Southey's name is now identified. Murray, <lb/>
the proprietor of the <hi rend="italic">Review,</hi> is said to have declared that he <lb/>
was more ashamed of that article than of any that had ever <lb/>
appeared in his magazine. Mrs. Barbauld's friends, Miss <lb/>
Edgeworth foremost among them, expressed their <reg orig="indigna-|tion">indignation</reg> <lb/>
and sympathy; a more ungentlemanlike, unjust, and <lb/>
insolent review, Miss Edgeworth said she had never read; <lb/>
and she wrote an inspiriting letter to her friend, concluding <lb/>
with the words, "Write on, shine out, and defy them." <lb/>
But at nearly seventy years of age Mrs. Barbauld was to <lb/>
be excused if she felt that younger and stronger hands <lb/>
must carry on the fight. The poem referred to was not <lb/>
her last literary effort, but it was the last of her writings <lb/>
published during her lifetime. Very little, perhaps, of her <lb/>
work has permanent value; one poem, however, that <lb/>
beginning "Life! I know not what thou art," which was <lb/>
written in extreme old age, will probably live as long as <lb/>
anything in the language. It indicates possibly what she <lb/>
<pb n="204" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0219"/>
might have done, had it not been for the tragedy of her <lb/>
married life. Of two lines in this poem&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>Life, we've been long together,</l>
<l>Through pleasant and through cloudy weather&mdash;</l>
</lg></q>
Wordsworth declared that, though he was not in the habit <lb/>
of grudging people their good things, he wished he had <lb/>
written those lines. Her mental powers remained clear and <lb/>
vigorous to the end of her long life. When she was past <lb/>
eighty, writing to Miss Edgeworth, she summed up, as it <lb/>
were, the worth of what she knew and did not know. "I <lb/>
find that many things I knew, I have forgotten; many <lb/>
things I <hi rend="italic">thought</hi> I knew, I find I knew nothing about; some <lb/>
things I know, I have found not worth knowing, and some <lb/>
things I would give&mdash;oh! what would one not give to know, <lb/>
are beyond the reach of human ken."</p>
<p>All her life through she laboured with her pen in defence <lb/>
of civil and religious liberty, against the iniquities of the <lb/>
slave trade, and for many other causes which have made <lb/>
life more worth living in England to-day. She died, <lb/>
universally honoured and respected, in 1825, aged <reg orig="eighty-|two">eighty-two</reg>.</p>

JOANNA BAILLIE</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Mrs. Joanna Baillie</hi>, as she was usually called, because, <lb/>
though she was never married, her age and literary <lb/>
reputation were held to entitle her to brevet rank, was a <lb/>
remarkable instance of a writer rapidly rising to the highest <lb/>
pinnacle of fame, and then as rapidly and surely descending <lb/>
almost to the common level of ordinary mortals. But the <lb/>
Scotch woman, with the blood of heroes in her veins, <lb/>
showed herself worthy of her descent, both by the modesty <lb/>
and dignity with which she bore her fame, and by the <lb/>
sweetness and unassuming simplicity with which she bore <lb/>
the loss of it. She was descended from Sir William <lb/>
Wallace, and the fame of this long-past ancestor is perhaps <lb/>
equalled by that of another and a much nearer relative. <lb/>
John Hunter, the great anatomist and physiologist, the <lb/>
founder of the College of Surgeons, was her mother's <lb/>
brother. She therefore might truly feel, not in a figurative <lb/>
sense, that in everything she was "sprung of earth's first <lb/>
blood"; and her double connection with the best and <lb/>
greatest of the heroes of Scotland was probably not without <lb/>
its influence on the development of her mind and character.</p>
<p>She was born at Bothwell, near Glasgow, on the banks <lb/>
of the Clyde, in 1762. In a poem addressed, near the <lb/>
close of her life, to her sister Agnes, she recalls how they <lb/>
had as children&mdash; <lb/>
<pb n="206" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0221"/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l rend="indent">&hellip; paddled barefoot side by side,</l>
<l>Among the sunny shallows of the Clyde.</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>Her father was a minister of the Scotch Church, and <lb/>
afterwards a Professor of Divinity in the University of <lb/>
Glasgow. His death in 1778, and the establishment of <lb/>
his son Matthew in the medical profession in London, <lb/>
caused Mrs. Baillie and her daughters, Joanna and Agnes, <lb/>
to remove there in 1784; and in London practically the <lb/>
rest of the future poetess's long life was spent. Her first <lb/>
work was a volume of verse published anonymously in <lb/>
1790. The first of her series of dramas, called <hi rend="italic">Plays on <lb/>
the Passions,</hi> was published in 1798. These were also <lb/>
published without the author's name. They made an <lb/>
immediate and very widespread impression; and their <lb/>
author was frequently, and by the very best judges, lauded <lb/>
as being equal, if not superior, to Shakespeare. The idea <lb/>
of these dramas, and of those in the successive volumes <lb/>
which appeared in 1802 and 1812, was to delineate a <lb/>
single dominant passion, such as hatred, envy, etc.; and <lb/>
each of the passions thus treated was made the subject first <lb/>
of a tragedy, then of a comedy. The language employed <lb/>
is easy, dignified, and simple: and it is probable that the <lb/>
contrast Joanna Baillie's dramas afforded in this respect to <lb/>
the dramas of the generation closing with the death of Dr. <lb/>
Johnson, was the reason of the great hold which they at <lb/>
once obtained upon the public mind. It is not easy in any <lb/>
other way to account for their extraordinary popularity. <lb/>
The time in which Joanna Baillie lived was one marked <lb/>
by a literary revolution, in which the formal, stilted, and <lb/>
didactic manner was overthrown, and poets and great <lb/>
writers sought to express their thoughts in simple and <lb/>
natural language. The leaders of this literary revolution <lb/>
were Wordsworth and Coleridge. In the great movement <lb/>
identified with their names Joanna Baillie bore a humbler, <lb/>
but a useful and effective part.</p>
<p>When Joanna Baillie's first volume of plays appeared, <lb/>
there was much speculation as to their possible authorship. <lb/>
Samuel Rogers, the banker, poet, and critic, thought that <lb/>
<pb n="207" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0222"/>
they were written by a man. It seems to have been <lb/>
difficult, at the end of the last century, for the great judges <lb/>
in the literary world to conceive that a poem, worthy of <lb/>
praise, could be of female authorship. Even so late as <lb/>
1841, a writer in the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly Review,</hi> writing upon <lb/>
Joanna Baillie's poetical works, puts the coping-stone upon <lb/>
the praise which he bestows upon her style and diction by <lb/>
saying that they are "masculine." He says, "Let us again <lb/>
express our admiration of the wonderful elasticity and <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">masculine</hi> force of mind exhibited in this vast collection of <lb/>
dramas;" and in another place the writer says, "The <lb/>
spirit breathing everywhere is a spirit of <hi rend="italic">manly</hi> purity and <lb/>
moral uprightness." We should say, at the present day, <lb/>
that there is certainly force of mind in Joanna Baillie's <lb/>
dramas, but that it is feminine, not masculine in character, <lb/>
and that the spirit of purity which breathes through them <lb/>
is essentially the womanly spirit. She had particular <lb/>
power and skill in the delineation of female characters, <lb/>
especially those of an unusual degree of elevation and <lb/>
purity. This in itself would have sufficiently betrayed the <lb/>
sex of the writer now when people have had far wider <lb/>
opportunities of judging of the differences between men <lb/>
and women as authors. Thackeray could give us an Ethel <lb/>
Newcome and a Becky Sharp, but women were needed to <lb/>
give us a Dorothea, a Marion Erle, or a Shirley Keeldar. <lb/>
Mrs. Siddons, the great actress, was charmed by the <lb/>
character of Jane de Montfort in Joanna Baillie's Tragedy <lb/>
on Hatred. The play called <hi rend="italic">De Montfort</hi> was put <lb/>
upon the stage by John Kemble, the brother of Mrs. <lb/>
Siddons: they both appeared in it. It ran for eleven <lb/>
nights, but it was not successful on the stage. Joanna's <lb/>
complete ignorance of what was requisite for the success <lb/>
of a play upon the stage foredoomed her to failure; the <lb/>
audience was, in the first act, let into the secret upon which <lb/>
the plot of the whole play turned, consequently as the <lb/>
drama proceeded the interest in it, instead of becoming <lb/>
more and more intense, gradually dwindled away, until in <lb/>
the fifth act it had quite evaporated. Mrs. Siddons, whose <lb/>

admiration for the character of Jane de Montfort has been <lb/>
already mentioned, is said to have remarked to the poetess, <lb/>
"Make me some more Jane de Montforts"&mdash;a request <lb/>
which does not appear to have been gratified. In all, five <lb/>
of Joanna Baillie's plays were put upon the stage&mdash;two of <lb/>
them, called <hi rend="italic">Constantine and Valeria</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Family <lb/>
Legend,</hi> had a considerable degree of success. <hi rend="italic">The <lb/>
Family Legend</hi> was brought out in Edinburgh in 1809, <lb/>
under the special patronage of Sir Walter Scott, who wrote <lb/>
the prologue of the play. At a later date it was reproduced <lb/>
in London.</p>
<p>The authorship of Joanna Baillie's first volume of plays <lb/>
did not long remain a secret. Sir Walter Scott was the <lb/>
first to make a successful guess as to the personality of the <lb/>
writer; and the discovery led to the formation of a warm <lb/>
friendship between him and Joanna, which only terminated <lb/>
with his life. Many of Scott's most delightful and <reg orig="charac-|teristic">characteristic</reg> <lb/>
letters were written to her. It was perhaps Scott's <lb/>
too generous appreciation of Joanna's powers as a dramatist <lb/>
that led to her plays being so much overrated, as they <lb/>
certainly were when they first appeared. Scott compared <lb/>
her to Shakespeare. Miss Mitford followed suit, saying of <lb/>
her sister-writer, "Her tragedies have a boldness and grasp <lb/>
of mind, a firmness of hand, and resonance of cadence that <lb/>
scarcely seem within the reach of a female writer." Byron <lb/>
made her an exception to his sweeping generalities <reg orig="concern-|ing">concerning</reg> <lb/>
the female sex, saying, "Woman &lpar;save Joanna Baillie&rpar; <lb/>
cannot write tragedy."</p>
<p>In 1825 the golden mists which had surrounded the <lb/>
sunrise of her literary life had melted away. Charles <lb/>
Lamb was too keen a critic probably to have been carried <lb/>
away by the stream of fashion at any time; but in the year <lb/>
mentioned, writing to his friend Bernard Barton, he says: <lb/>
"I think you told me your acquaintance with the drama <lb/>
was confined to Shakespeare and Miss Baillie: some read <lb/>
only Milton and Croly. The gap is as from an ananas to <lb/>
a turnip." Lamb's contemptuous reference measures the <lb/>
rapid fall from the heights of fame which Joanna Baillie <lb/>
<pb n="209" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0224"/>
endured, and endured without any failure of sweetness and <lb/>
dignity of character.</p>
<p>Joanna Baillie's day as a poetess was of short duration: <lb/>
it is now chiefly as a woman that she charms and helps us. <lb/>
Her house at Hampstead was for many years a meeting-place <lb/>
for those who were most worth meeting, either for talent <lb/>
or goodness; her kindly and gentle influence brought out <lb/>
all that was best in her guests and companions. In Miss <lb/>
Martineau's autobiography she has something to say about <lb/>
nearly all the lions and lionesses of the literary London of <lb/>
her day, and she singles out our poetess for special <reg orig="com-|mendation">commendation</reg>. <lb/>
"There was Joanna Baillie," she writes, <lb/>
"whose serene and gentle life was never troubled by the <lb/>
pains and penalties of vanity; what a charming spectacle <lb/>
was she! Mrs. Barbauld's published correspondence tells <lb/>
of her in 1800, as a 'young lady of Hampstead whom I <lb/>
visited, and who came to Mr. Barbauld's meeting, all the <lb/>
while with as innocent a face as if she had never written a <lb/>
line.' That was two years before I was born. When I <lb/>
met her about thirty years afterwards, there she was, still <lb/>
'with as innocent a face as if she had never written a line!' <lb/>
And this was after an experience which would have been <lb/>
a bitter trial to an author with a particle of vanity. She <lb/>
had enjoyed a fame almost without parallel, and had <reg orig="out-|lived">outlived</reg> <lb/>
it. She had been told every day for years, through <lb/>
every possible channel, that she was second only to <lb/>
Shakespeare, if second; and then she had seen her works <lb/>
drop out of notice, so that, of the generation who grew up <lb/>
before her eyes, not one in a thousand had read a line of <lb/>
her plays; yet was her serenity never disturbed, nor her <lb/>
merry humour in the least dimmed" &lpar;<hi rend="italic">Autobiography,</hi> vol. <lb/>
i. p. 385&rpar;.</p>
<p>This serene and happy temperament accompanied Joanna <lb/>
throughout her long life. She went on writing till past <lb/>
eighty, and lived to the great age of eighty-nine. Her <lb/>
sister Agnes, her inseparable friend and companion, lived <lb/>
to be over a hundred, and preserved her faculties clearly <lb/>
to the end. Joanna Baillie was never ill. The day <reg orig="be-|fore">before</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="210" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0225"/>
her death she expressed a strong desire to die. She <lb/>
went to bed, apparently in her usual health, but was <lb/>
found to be in a state of coma in the morning, and she <lb/>
died on the afternoon of the same day, 23d February <lb/>
1851.</p>

HANNAH MORE</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Miss Charlotte M. Yonge's</hi> charming little biography of <lb/>
Hannah More brings strikingly before us the picture of the <lb/>
authoress of <hi rend="italic">C&oelig;lebs in Search of a Wife,</hi> and also depicts in <lb/>
a way that will not easily be forgotten, some of the more <lb/>
striking contrasts between the present day and the England <lb/>
of eighty or ninety years ago. There are some who are <lb/>
always inclined to say "the old is better"; but they must <lb/>
be very curiously constituted who can look back on the <lb/>
social condition of our country at the end of the last century <lb/>
and beginning of this, without being filled with amazement <lb/>
and thankfulness at the improvement that has taken place.</p>
<p>It is not so generally remembered as it ought to be, <lb/>
that the second half of Hannah More's life was devoted to <lb/>
the service of the poor, especially to the spread of some <lb/>
measure of education and civilisation in the then almost <lb/>
savage districts in the neighbourhood of Cheddar, and of <lb/>
the Mendip Hills. Yet even so advanced an educationalist <lb/>
as Hannah More thought that on no account should the <lb/>
poor be taught to write. In a letter to Bishop Beadon, <lb/>
describing her system of instruction for the poor children <lb/>
in the parishes immediately under her care, she says: "They <lb/>
learn on week-days such coarse work as may fit them for <lb/>
servants. <hi rend="italic">I allow of no writing for the poor</hi>. My object is <lb/>
not to make fanatics, but to train up the lower classes in <lb/>
<pb n="212" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0227"/>
habits of industry and piety." We cannot have a more <lb/>
apt illustration of the fact that the advanced reformer of <lb/>
one generation may become, by the natural growth of <lb/>
society, the type of what is most exaggeratedly retrograde <lb/>
in the next. It would be very ungenerous and <reg orig="short-|sighted">shortsighted</reg> <lb/>
on our part to condemn Hannah More for her <lb/>
narrowness of view. She belonged to a day when the <lb/>
farmers in the village, where she sought to establish a <lb/>
Sunday school, begged her to desist because "religion <lb/>
would be the ruin of agriculture, and had done nothing <lb/>
but mischief ever since it had been brought in by the <lb/>
monks at Glastonbury." At another place her educational <lb/>
schemes were so stoutly opposed by all the leading <reg orig="inhabit-|ants">inhabitants</reg> <lb/>
that it was impossible to obtain for the school the <lb/>
shelter of any roof, and the children were accordingly <reg orig="as-|sembled">assembled</reg> <lb/>
to sing a few hymns under an apple-tree. They <lb/>
were soon, however, driven from this shelter by the fears <lb/>
of the owner of the tree, who said he was afraid the hymn <lb/>
singing was "methody," and that "methody" had blighted <lb/>
an apple-tree belonging to his mother!</p>
<p>Even these examples of ignorance and superstition <lb/>
might possibly, however, be matched at the present day. <lb/>
More thoroughly significant of a state of things that is <lb/>
past and gone for ever, is the following incident."On a <lb/>
Sunday," about the year 1790, "in the midst of morning <lb/>
service the congregations in the Bristol churches were <lb/>
startled by the bell and voice of the crier, proclaiming the <lb/>
reward of a guinea for a poor negro girl who had run <lb/>
away." The idea of property in human beings is one that <lb/>
is now universally abhorrent; but less than a hundred <lb/>
years ago the loss of such property could be cried in the <lb/>
midst of congregations assembled to acknowledge the <lb/>
Fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of humanity, <lb/>
and it was only one here and there among the worshippers <lb/>
who felt the blasphemy and the mockery of the proceeding.</p>
<p>As an illustration of the extreme hardships endured by <lb/>
the poor before the era of steam manufactures had set in, <lb/>
we learn that the difficulty in obtaining clothes was so <lb/>
<pb n="213" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0228"/>
great that at Brentford, close to London, thrifty parents <lb/>
bought rags by the pound, and made clothing for their <lb/>
children by patching the pieces together. Brushes and <lb/>
combs, it is added, were entirely unknown. It is no <reg orig="ex-|aggeration">exaggeration</reg>, <lb/>
therefore, to say that the poorest beggar of the <lb/>
present day can, if he choose, be more luxuriously clad and <lb/>
cared for than the children of the thrifty poor a hundred <lb/>
years ago. The difference in morals is as great as the <lb/>
difference in manners and education. Hannah More heard <lb/>
a charity sermon, in which the preacher, a dignified <reg orig="ecclesi-|astic">ecclesiastic</reg>, <lb/>
propounded that "the rich and great should be <reg orig="ex-|tremely">extremely</reg> <lb/>
liberal in their charities, because they <hi rend="italic">were happily <lb/>
exempted from the severer virtues</hi>." This was the old Papal <lb/>
practice of the sale of indulgences appearing again in a <reg orig="Pro-|testant">Protestant</reg> <lb/>
dress. No wonder, if this was a type of the Gospel <lb/>
that was preached to the rich, that Patty, Hannah's sister, <lb/>
was accustomed to say that she had good hope that the <lb/>
hearts of some of the "rich poor wretches" might be touched <lb/>
by her sister's eloquence.</p>
<p>The change of manners may be illustrated by the <reg orig="follow-|ing">following</reg> <lb/>
anecdote. Hannah More, in the height of her literary <lb/>
celebrity, was asked to sit next the Bishop of Chester, <lb/>
Dr. Porteous, at dinner, and make him talk. She pressed <lb/>
him to take a little wine. He replied, "I can't drink a <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">little,</hi> child: therefore I never touch it. Abstinence is easy <lb/>
to me; temperance would be difficult."</p>
<p>These were days when Edmund Spenser was not <reg orig="con-|sidered">considered</reg> <lb/>
a poet, and when Dryden and Pope were <reg orig="pre-|ferred">preferred</reg> <lb/>
to Shakespeare. Hannah, however, defended Milton's <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">L' Allegro, Il Penseroso,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Lycidas,</hi> against the strictures <lb/>
of Dr. Johnson; though they found themselves in entire <lb/>
agreement in depreciating Milton's sonnets. Johnson's <lb/>
simile for a sonnet was "a bead carved out of a cherry <lb/>
stone." The noble and solemn music of Milton's majestic <lb/>
sonnets certainly did not harmonise with Johnson's image, <lb/>
and, therefore, as Milton's sonnets were not pretty <reg orig="play-|things">playthings</reg>, <lb/>
it was agreed that he could not write sonnets.</p>
<p>The bigotry and narrowness of religious criticism at <lb/>
<pb n="214" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0229"/>
that day may be measured by the fact, which Hannah <lb/>
mentions in one of her letters, that her book on <hi rend="italic">Practical <lb/>
Piety</hi> had been attacked by the Calvinists as giving a <reg orig="sanc-|tion">sanction</reg> <lb/>
to idolatry, because she had spoken of the sun as "he." <lb/>
She did not altogether escape being tarred with the same <lb/>
brush, if we may judge from the passage in <hi rend="italic">C&oelig;lebs,</hi> where <lb/>
she makes Mr. Stanley complain of Day's <hi rend="italic">Sandford and <lb/>
Merton,</hi> and other books which had lately been written for <lb/>
the young, that there was "no intimation in them of the <lb/>
corruption of human nature, and thus that they contradict <lb/>
the catechism when it speaks of being 'born in sin, and the <lb/>
children of wrath.'" She could not help, it appears, taking <lb/>
her religion sadly, as English people are supposed to take <lb/>
their pleasures. There was, however, a great fund of <lb/>
natural gaiety and light-heartedness in her, but whether <lb/>
she considered this one of the results of being a child of <lb/>
wrath or not, she did not seem to think gaiety, any more <lb/>
than writing, was a thing to be encouraged in the poor. <lb/>
She describes a great meeting of the schools founded by <lb/>
herself in the Mendip Hills. This annual "Mendip feast" <lb/>
took the form of what we should now call a gigantic school <lb/>
treat. The schools established were spread over an area <lb/>
of twenty-eight miles, and nearly the whole population of <lb/>
the villages, to the number of seven or eight thousand <lb/>
people, attended. The children were generously regaled <lb/>
on substantial fare. But nothing in the form of a game <lb/>
or a festivity of any kind was permitted. The singing of <lb/>
"God save the King" "is the only pleasure in the form of <lb/>
a song we ever allow. &hellip; The meeting," she says again, <lb/>
"took its rise from religious institutions. The day passed <lb/>
in the exercise of duties, and closed with joy. Nothing of <lb/>
a gay nature was introduced. &hellip;"</p>
<p>One cannot help thinking, on reading this, that she had <lb/>
only herself to thank if, in spite of all her talents and <reg orig="good-|ness">goodness</reg>, <lb/>
her name became a byword for severity and primness. <lb/>
Charles Lamb speaks in one of his early letters of "<reg orig="out-|Hannahing">outHannahing</reg> <lb/>
Hannah More"; and she herself tells what she <lb/>
states is a true story, illustrating the way in which she was <lb/>
<pb n="215" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0230"/>
regarded in circles where childish merriment was not <reg orig="dis-|countenanced">discountenanced</reg>: <lb/>
"A lady gave a very great children's ball," <lb/>
wrote Miss Hannah, somewhere about 1792: "at the upper <lb/>
end of the room, in an elevated place, was dressed out a <lb/>
figure to represent me, with a large rod in my hand, prepared <lb/>
to punish such naughty doings."</p>
<p>The pity of this was that her natural disposition seems <lb/>
to have been sprightly and gay enough; her verses and <lb/>
other compositions often show a very pretty wit. If she <lb/>
had been as merry when she undertook her great work on <lb/>
the Mendips, as she was in the days when she was the friend <lb/>
and constant companion of Garrick, Johnson, and Horace <lb/>
Walpole, the general impression left by her character would <lb/>
have been a much more attractive one. Miss Yonge thinks <lb/>
that the chief reason of the austerity of her religion is to <lb/>
be found in the low condition of morals at the time. "There <lb/>
was scarcely," she writes, "an innocent popular song in <reg orig="ex-|istence">existence</reg>, <lb/>
simple enough," &hellip; "and unconnected with evil, and <lb/>
the children and their parents were still too utterly rough <lb/>
and uncivilised to make it safe to relax the bonds of restraint <lb/>
for a moment." We cannot think that this excuse is <reg orig="alto-|gether">altogether</reg> <lb/>
valid: the age that had produced "John Gilpin" and <lb/>
"Goody Two Shoes" can hardly be said to be without one <lb/>
innocent popular song or story which would amuse children. <lb/>
The gloomy complexion given to religion by the school of <lb/>
which Hannah More was a member has a great deal to <lb/>
answer for; in some temperaments, among whom the poet <lb/>
Cowper may be quoted as a type, the gentle and sensitive <lb/>
nature was plunged into profound and morbid melancholy <lb/>
which wrecked the whole existence of its victim; in others, <lb/>
of a more energetic and rebellious character, it produced a <lb/>
violent reaction, not only against religion, but against all <lb/>
moral order, and every kind of restraint. Just as the <reg orig="ex-|cesses">excesses</reg> <lb/>
of the reign of Charles II. followed the grim and rigid <lb/>
piety of Puritan England, so the orgies of the Prince Regent <lb/>
and his boon companions followed the austere and <reg orig="mirth-|killing">mirthkilling</reg> <lb/>
religion of the early evangelicals. About the time <lb/>
of which we are now writing, a serious attack was made in <lb/>
<pb n="216" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0231"/>
one of the religious papers upon Jane Taylor, the joint <lb/>
authoress with her sister of <hi rend="italic">Hymns for Infant Minds,</hi> <reg orig="be-|cause">because</reg> <lb/>
in one of her stories she had represented, without <lb/>
reprobation, a family party of young children enjoying a <lb/>
dance together. When people impute wickedness to actions <lb/>
that are in themselves innocent and harmless, they are <lb/>
tampering with and weakening their own moral sense, and <lb/>
that of all those brought within their influence. To invent <lb/>
sins generally ends in manufacturing sinners.</p>
<p>Hannah More, the youngest but one of five sisters, <lb/>
daughters of Jacob More, master of the school at Stapleton, <lb/>
near Bristol, was born about 1745. Her father belonged <lb/>
to a Norfolk family, several members of which had been <lb/>
numbered amongst Cromwell's Ironsides. Jacob More, <lb/>
however, forsook the family traditions both in politics <lb/>
and religion. He became a churchman and a Tory; and <lb/>
this may have been the cause of his leaving the home of <lb/>
his fathers, and settling in the West Country. He here <lb/>
married a farmer's daughter, of whom little is known <reg orig="ex-|cept">except</reg> <lb/>
that she persuaded her husband to impart his classical <lb/>
and mathematical learning to his clever little daughter, <lb/>
and that by many acts of motherly sympathy she <reg orig="encour-|aged">encouraged</reg> <lb/>
her children to use the talents with which Nature had <lb/>
very liberally endowed them. The five sisters, Mary, Betsy, <lb/>
Sally, Hannah, and Patty, were a tribe of whom any mother <lb/>
might have been proud. Hannah and Patty were <reg orig="insepar-|able">inseparable</reg>, <lb/>
sharing every hope and every occupation and <reg orig="posses-|sion">possession</reg>. <lb/>
Their taste was for literature. Sally was the wit <lb/>
of the family. Mary and Betsy supplied the practical, <lb/>
housewifely element in the quintet. As a little girl, <lb/>
Hannah's two ambitions were to "live in a cottage too <lb/>
low for a clock, and to go to London to see bishops and <lb/>
booksellers!" At the age of twenty-one, Mary More set <lb/>
up a school on her own account in Bristol. Betsy and <lb/>
Sally were her assistants, and Hannah and Patty were <lb/>
among the first batch of pupils. Sally in after years thus <lb/>
described this adventurous proceeding to her friend Dr. <lb/>
Johnson: "We were born with more desires than guineas. <lb/>
<pb n="217" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0232"/>
As years increased our appetites the cupboard at home <lb/>
grew too small to gratify them; and with a bottle of <lb/>
water, a bed, and a blanket, we set out to seek our <reg orig="for-|tunes">fortunes</reg>. <lb/>
We found a great house with nothing in it&mdash;and <lb/>
it was like to remain so&mdash;till, looking into our <reg orig="knowledge-|boxes">knowledgeboxes</reg>, <lb/>
we happened to find a little <hi rend="italic">larning</hi>&mdash;a good thing <lb/>
when land is gone, or rather none, and so at last, by giving <lb/>
a little of this larning to those who had none, we got a <lb/>
good store of gold in return" &lpar;pp. 6, 7, Miss Yonge's <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Hannah More</hi>&rpar;.</p>
<p>Hannah's unusual abilities soon began to attract notice. <lb/>
She wrote a play for school acting, which had a great <lb/>
success; we are told how on one occasion, when she was <lb/>
ill &lpar;her health was always delicate&rpar;, her doctor was so <lb/>
carried away by the charm of her conversation that he <lb/>
forgot to make any inquiries about her health; he took <lb/>
his leave, and was on the point of departing from the <lb/>
house, when he returned with the inquiry, "And how are <lb/>
you, my poor child?"</p>
<p>Hannah's first visit to London was about 1772 or 1773, <lb/>
when she was twenty-seven or twenty-eight years old. She <lb/>
saw the first performance of Sheridan's <hi rend="italic">Rivals,</hi> and sagely <lb/>
remarks that the writer must be treated with indulgence, <lb/>
for that "much is to be forgiven in an author of <reg orig="twenty-|three">twenty-three</reg>, <lb/>
whose genius is likely to be his principal inheritance." <lb/>
She was introduced to Miss Reynolds, Sir Joshua's sister, <lb/>
and this lady promised to make her known to Dr. Johnson. <lb/>
She saw Garrick, the great actor, in <hi rend="italic">King Lear,</hi> and was so <lb/>
much impressed by him that she wrote a long description <lb/>
of his acting in a letter that was handed about among her <lb/>
friends and gained a sort of half publicity, as seems to have <lb/>
been not unusual at that time. This letter paved the way <lb/>
for an introduction to Garrick and his wife, and Hannah <lb/>
More became one of their most intimate and valued friends. <lb/>
Garrick encouraged Hannah to write for the stage, and <lb/>
some of her pieces, under his fostering care, had an <reg orig="astonish-|ing">astonishing</reg> <lb/>
degree of success. Garrick's favourite name for the <lb/>
poetess was "Nine," by way of delicate comparison with the <lb/>
<pb n="218" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0233"/>
nine muses. Horace Walpole used to call her "Saint <lb/>
Hannah." Dr. Johnson called her "a saucy girl," perhaps <lb/>
the nicest epithet of the three. When Garrick died, <lb/>
Hannah was one of the ladies admitted to Westminster <lb/>
Abbey to witness his funeral. Hannah spent the first year <lb/>
of her friend's widowhood with Mrs. Garrick at her house <lb/>
near Hampton; and on many other occasions it was shown, <lb/>
in a similar way, that Hannah was one on whom her friends <lb/>
were accustomed to depend for sympathy and support in <lb/>
the darkest hours of mourning and sorrow. After Garrick's <lb/>
death Hannah never visited a theatre again. She did not <lb/>
even go to see her own play, <hi rend="italic">The Fatal Falsehood,</hi> which <lb/>
Garrick had been preparing to put on the stage at the time <lb/>
of his death.</p>
<p>From the time of her first entry into London society <lb/>
she seems to have had access to all that was best in the <lb/>
world of literature and art, and to have played a <reg orig="dis-|tinguished">distinguished</reg> <lb/>
part there. It is, therefore, the more to her <lb/>
credit that she turned from this gay and brilliant life in <lb/>
order to devote herself to the work of education and <lb/>
civilisation among the poor people of Cheddar and the <lb/>
Mendips.</p>
<p>She and her sister Patty had settled in a pretty cottage <lb/>
home called Cowslip Green, in the parish of Wrington, <lb/>
Bristol. Here they were visited by their friends from the <lb/>
great world, and hence they, in their turn, made their <lb/>
annual visit to London. Mention has already been made <lb/>
of the painful impression produced in Hannah on hearing, <lb/>
in a Bristol church, the loss of a negro girl proclaimed by <lb/>
the crier in the midst of the morning service. She was a <lb/>
woman much influenced by her friendships. She had been <lb/>
a poetess and dramatist under the influence of Johnson and <lb/>
Garrick; Wilberforce and John Newton &lpar;Cowper's friend&rpar; <lb/>
had now awakened in her a passion of pity for slaves and <lb/>
a passion of hatred against slavery. Miss Yonge states <lb/>
that Hannah was before this a friend of Lady Middleton, <lb/>
"who had first inspired William Wilberforce with the idea <lb/>
of his great work in life; and on going to make her annual <lb/>
<pb n="219" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0234"/>
visit to Mrs. Garrick in the winter of 1787, she first heard <lb/>
of the Bill that was to be introduced into Parliament for <lb/>
the abolition of slavery." In 1789 William Wilberforce <lb/>
came to spend a few days with the Misses More, at Cowslip <lb/>
Green. By way of showing him the beauties of the <lb/>
neighbourhood the ladies sent him to see the picturesque <lb/>
cliffs and caves of Cheddar. When their guest returned <lb/>
he was remarkably silent; the food that had been sent <lb/>
with him was untasted, and he remained for some hours <lb/>
alone in his room. His hostesses naturally feared that he <lb/>
was ill; but when he rejoined them they discovered that <lb/>
instead of admiring the natural beauties of Cheddar, the <lb/>
tender heart of the future emancipator of the slaves had <lb/>
been wholly engrossed by the evidences which had presented <lb/>
themselves of human depravity, misery, and neglect. The <lb/>
inhabitants of the picturesque region were almost savages; <lb/>
their poverty was frightful; there was no sort of attempt <lb/>
at education of any kind; there were no resident <reg orig="clergy-|men">clergymen</reg>; <lb/>
the people were utterly lawless; it was unsafe for a <lb/>
decent person to go amongst them unprotected; writs <lb/>
could not be served but at risk of the constable being <lb/>
thrown down some cliff or pit. These things Wilberforce <lb/>
had discovered, and they obscured for him all the pleasure <lb/>
which pretty scenery could afford. "Miss More," he said, <lb/>
"something must be done for Cheddar;" and after much <lb/>
consultation and thought, before he went away, he again <lb/>
charged the ladies with the task of civilising and educating <lb/>
the wild district which lay at their doors, adding, "If you <lb/>
will be at the trouble, I will be at the expense."</p>
<p>From this time the sisters led a new life. It is true <lb/>
that Hannah did not give up her literary pursuits; she <lb/>
laboured with her pen as well as with other instruments <lb/>
in pursuit of her end. But now the main object of both <lb/>
Patty and Hannah was to educate and reclaim the <reg orig="inhabit-|ants">inhabitants</reg> <lb/>
of the districts which have been named. The work, <lb/>
merely from a physical point of view, was by no means <lb/>
light. There were no roads, or such bad ones that the <lb/>
only practical means of travelling was on horseback. Their <lb/>
<pb n="220" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0235"/>
first task was to endeavour to gain the goodwill and <lb/>
assistance of the farmers and gentry. Patty says of some of <lb/>
these, "They are are as ignorant as the beasts that perish; <lb/>
intoxicated every day before dinner, and plunged into such <lb/>
vice that I begin to think London a virtuous place." Such <lb/>
clergy as did occasionally visit the district might as well <lb/>
have stayed away. Of one Patty says, "Mr. G&mdash;&mdash; is <lb/>
intoxicated about six times a week, and very frequently is <lb/>
prevented from preaching by two black eyes, honestly <lb/>
earned by fighting." The sisters showed their good sense, <lb/>
as well as their benevolence, by finding out and utilising <lb/>
whatever in the way of a good influence existed in the <lb/>
district. They rejected no help because the helper did not <lb/>
conform to their particular pattern of orthodoxy. They <lb/>
did not hesitate, although they were strict churchwomen, <lb/>
to engage a Methodist to act as mistress in one of their <lb/>
Sunday schools. They soon had thirteen villages under <lb/>
their care, and an improvement began to be visible in <lb/>
nearly all of them. Of one of them, Congresbury, Hannah <lb/>
wrote describing the first opening of the school: "It was <lb/>
an affecting sight. Several of the grown-up youths had <lb/>
been tried at the last assizes, three were the children of a <lb/>
person lately condemned to be hanged, many thieves, all <lb/>
ignorant, profane, and vicious beyond belief. Of this <reg orig="ban-|ditti">banditti</reg> <lb/>
we have enlisted one hundred and seventy; and <lb/>
when the clergyman, a hard man, who is also the magistrate, <lb/>
saw these creatures kneeling round us, whom he had seldom <lb/>
seen but to commit or punish in some way, he burst into <lb/>
tears. I can do them little good, I fear, but the grace of <lb/>
God can do all. &hellip;"</p>
<p>The Misses More did not escape bitter persecution and <lb/>
misrepresentation in their good work. A Mr. Bere, curate <lb/>
of Wedmore, distinguished himself by his furious hostility <lb/>
to them. He threatened them with penal proceedings for <lb/>
teaching without a license, induced the farmers to make <lb/>
formal complaint to the Archdeacon against them, and <lb/>
obtained an affidavit from a half-witted young man, whom <lb/>
they had befriended, making personal charges against them. <lb/>
<pb n="221" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0236"/>
Influential friends, however, came to the ladies' assistance. <lb/>
The good Bishop said, "When he heard it was Miss Hannah <lb/>
More he knew it was all right." But the persecution they <lb/>
endured was not without its effect on their health and <lb/>
spirits. Hannah was laid up for about two years at this <lb/>
time, and was unable to pursue her work amongst her poor <lb/>
scholars.</p>
<p>In 1802 the sisters removed from Cowslip Green to <lb/>
Barley Wood; here Hannah wrote some of her best known <lb/>
books. None of her works is better known, at least by <lb/>
name, than <hi rend="italic">C&oelig;lebs in Search of a Wife</hi>. Here also, by <lb/>
the request of Queen Charlotte, she wrote a book of advice <lb/>
on the education of Princess Charlotte, who, it was thought, <lb/>
was destined to become Queen of England. <hi rend="italic">The Shepherd <lb/>
of Salisbury Plain</hi> was written at Cowslip Green, as one <lb/>
of a large series of simple stories for the poor, intended by <lb/>
the sisters to counteract and undersell popular literature <lb/>
of an objectionable character. The Misses More produced <lb/>
three of these tracts a month, and it is calculated that more <lb/>
than two millions were sold in a year. By many <hi rend="italic">The <lb/>
Shepherd of Salisbury Plain</hi> was considered Hannah More's <lb/>
masterpiece. Wilberforce said he "would rather present <lb/>
himself before Heaven with the <hi rend="italic">Shepherd</hi> in his hand than <lb/>
with <hi rend="italic">Peveril of the Peak</hi>."</p>
<p>At Barley Wood Hannah experienced the great and <lb/>
unavoidable calamity of old age, the gradual loss, by death, <lb/>
of the friends and allies of her youth. Johnson, Burke, <lb/>
Reynolds, and Garrick were dead long ago, and the brilliant <lb/>
society in London, of which Hannah had formed part, had <lb/>
lost many of its stars. One by one, death laid its hand on <lb/>
the members of the More sisterhood, till Hannah and Patty, <lb/>
the lifelong friends and companions, were the only two <lb/>
left. In September 1819, Mr. and Mrs. Wilberforce being <lb/>
on a visit to the sisters, Patty sat up till a late hour of the <lb/>
night talking to her guests of old days, and Hannah's first <lb/>
introduction to London. In the morning the first news <lb/>
that met the visitors' ears was that Patty was dying. She <lb/>
lingered about a week, but never regained consciousness, <lb/>
<pb n="222" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0237"/>
and then Hannah was left quite alone, the last of all the <lb/>
five. But her friends gathered round her, and her vigorous <lb/>
intellect and strong sense of duty did not allow her to be <lb/>
idle. She still had vivacity enough to write humorous <lb/>
letters and verses, and to poke fun at what she considered <lb/>
the misdirected zeal of some educationalists.</p>
<p>A few years before her death, Hannah More removed <lb/>
to Windsor Terrace, Clifton. Her old age was cheered <lb/>
by the companionship of a friend, Miss Frowd, of whom <lb/>
Miss More wrote, she is "my domestic chaplain, my house <lb/>
apothecary, knitter and lamplighter, missionary to my <lb/>
numerous and learned seminaries, and, without controversy, <lb/>
the queen of clubs" &lpar;penny clubs&rpar;. When an old lady of <lb/>
more than eighty can write in this buoyant strain, it is the <lb/>
more to be regretted that she seemed to have thought <lb/>
gaiety was a thing it was dangerous to encourage a taste <lb/>
for in the poor. Still, though we cannot help regretting <lb/>
this, we shall do well if we can imitate, in however humble <lb/>
a degree, her unselfish devotion to goodness and the way <lb/>
in which she spent the best years of her life in trying to <lb/>
improve the lot of the most destitute and miserable of her <lb/>
neighbours. She lived to be eighty-eight. She had no <lb/>
long illness, and no failure of any of her mental faculties, <lb/>
except that of memory. Her body became gradually <lb/>
weaker, and she longed for death. One day "she stretched <lb/>
out her arms, crying, 'Patty! joy!'" She never spoke <lb/>
again, dying a few hours later, on 7th September 1833.</p>

THE AMERICAN ABOLITIONISTS</hi></head>
<div2 type="section" id="d33">
<head>PRUDENCE CRANDALL AND LUCRETIA MOTT</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Everybody</hi> is an Abolitionist now. There is not, probably, <lb/>
in any part of Europe or the United States a single human <lb/>
being who would now defend slavery as an institution, or <lb/>
who thinks that for man to own property in his fellow-man, <lb/>
to be able to buy and sell him and dispose of his whole life, <lb/>
is not a sin and an outrage against all feelings of humanity.</p>
<p>Slavery was put an end to in the British Dominions nearly <lb/>
seventy years ago, but it is only twenty-six years since it <lb/>
was abolished in the United States of America. The time <lb/>
is well within the memory of many persons now living <lb/>
when to be an Abolitionist, even in the New England <lb/>
States, was to be hated and reviled, to render one's self the <lb/>
object of the bitterest persecution, to risk comfort, happiness, <lb/>
and even life. In England the Abolitionist party was <lb/>
headed by men like Wilberforce, Clarkson, Macaulay, and <lb/>
Buxton, who all enjoyed the advantages belonging to <lb/>
education, good social position, and comparative wealth. <lb/>
It was always "respectable" in England to be an <reg orig="Aboli-|tionist">Abolitionist</reg>, <lb/>
and it was not necessary to possess the courage and <lb/>
devotion of a martyr to declare one's hatred of slavery. <lb/>
But in the United States it was quite otherwise. Great <lb/>
and influential people of all parties there were for many <lb/>
<pb n="224" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0239"/>
years vehemently opposed to the emancipation of the slaves. <lb/>
Even as late as 1841 Miss Martineau describes the great <lb/>
sensation made among "the <hi rend="italic">&eacute;lite</hi> of intellectual Boston" <lb/>
when they found that Lord Morpeth &lpar;afterwards the Earl <lb/>
of Carlisle&rpar;, who was then on a visit to the United States <lb/>
of America, had openly expressed his sympathy with the <lb/>
principles of the Abolitionists.</p>
<p>In 1835 the Boston mob dragged William Lloyd <lb/>
Garrison, the leader of the American Abolitionists, through <lb/>
the streets with a rope round his neck; and his life was <lb/>
only saved from their fury through the stratagem of the <lb/>
Mayor, who committed him to gaol as a disturber of the <lb/>
peace. In 1841 the feeling against the Abolitionists was <lb/>
a little less violent; but "anti - slavery opinions were at <lb/>
that time in deep disrepute in the United States; they <lb/>
were 'vulgar,' and those who held them were not noticed <lb/>
in society, and were insulted and injured as often as <lb/>
possible by genteeler people and more complaisant <reg orig="re-|publicans">republicans</reg>." <lb/>
It was a matter of great astonishment to the <lb/>
polite world of Boston that the English aristocrat made no <lb/>
secret of the fact that he shared the opinions of the despised <lb/>
and hated Abolitionists.</p>
<p>In 1828 Garrison was a poor lad, working for his living as <lb/>
a printer; he determined to devote himself to the gigantic <lb/>
task of freeing his country from the curse of slavery. He <lb/>
began to print with his own hands and publish an <reg orig="anti-|slavery">antislavery</reg> <lb/>
paper called the <hi rend="italic">Liberator</hi>. He wandered up and <lb/>
down the United States as an anti-slavery lecturer; by and <lb/>
by a few friends began to gather round him, and those <lb/>
who shared his principles and his enthusiasm gradually <lb/>
made themselves known to him. In 1833, being then <lb/>
twenty-eight years old, he received a letter from a young <lb/>
Quaker lady, Miss Prudence Crandall, who asked his advice <lb/>
under the following circumstances: Two years previously <lb/>
she had bought a large house at Canterbury, in the State of <lb/>
Connecticut, and had started there a boarding-school for <lb/>
girls. She had flourished beyond her expectations, and had <lb/>
every prospect of forming a highly successful school. She <lb/>
<pb n="225" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0240"/>
wrote to Garrison and asked his advice about changing her <lb/>
white scholars for coloured ones. She says in her letter, <lb/>
very simply, not giving herself any airs of martyrdom, "I <lb/>
have been for some months past determined, if possible, <lb/>
during the remainder of my life to benefit the people of <lb/>
colour." Under these quiet words lay a firmness of <reg orig="pur-|pose">purpose</reg> <lb/>
that would have supported her to the stake if need <lb/>
were. She did not, on that occasion, tell Garrison that <lb/>
she had already admitted to her classes, not as a boarder, <lb/>
but as a day scholar, a very respectable young negro woman, <lb/>
whose family she knew well as members of the church which <lb/>
she herself attended. By this action she had given great <lb/>
offence to the "genteel" inhabitants of Canterbury. The <lb/>
wife of an Episcopal clergyman who lived in the town told <lb/>
her that if she retained "that coloured girl" the school <lb/>
would be ruined. Prudence replied, that though the school <lb/>
might be ruined she would not turn her scholar out. She <lb/>
soon discovered that many of her pupils would leave, not to <lb/>
return, if the coloured girl were retained, but this did not <lb/>
shake her resolution. She began to consider whether it <lb/>
would not be possible to have a school for coloured girls <lb/>
only; and upon this point, not saying anything of her <lb/>
own sacrifices, she wrote, as before mentioned, to consult <lb/>
Garrison. Very soon after the date of this letter the <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Liberator</hi> newspaper contained an advertisement, stating <lb/>
that "Miss P. Crandall &lpar;a white lady&rpar;, of Canterbury, Conn." <lb/>
had opened a "High School for young coloured ladies and <lb/>
misses."</p>
<p>By this time the town of Canterbury had put itself into <lb/>
the greatest state of excitement about Miss Crandall's <reg orig="pro-|ject">project</reg>. <lb/>
She might have reasonably thought when she had <lb/>
converted her school into one for "young coloured ladies <lb/>
and misses" only, that so long as she and her pupils and <lb/>
their parents were satisfied no one else had any concern in <lb/>
the matter. But this was not the view taken by the <lb/>
inhabitants of Canterbury. Three town's meetings were <lb/>
summoned in one week to consider what measures could be <lb/>
taken to stop and thwart her project. At first it seems to <lb/>
<pb n="226" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0241"/>
have been thought desirable to try the fair means of <reg orig="per-|suasion">persuasion</reg>, <lb/>
and Miss Crandall was waited on by a deputation of <lb/>
leading gentlemen of the place, who professed to feel "a real <lb/>
regard for the coloured people, and perfect willingness that <lb/>
they should be educated, <hi rend="italic">provided it could be effected in some <lb/>
other place</hi>." Miss Crandall's scheme of educating them in <lb/>
her own house in Canterbury would, they assured her, bring <lb/>
disgrace and ruin on the whole town. Miss Crandall heard <lb/>
them out, and then announced her determination to carry <lb/>
out her plan. There was an immovable firmness under the <lb/>
tranquillity of the young Quakeress's demeanour. Another <lb/>
town's meeting was called, and Miss Crandall was allowed <lb/>
to be represented by counsel, but the gentlemen who took <lb/>
up her cause were not granted a hearing, on the ground that <lb/>
they were outsiders, not natives of the town, and the whole <lb/>
of Canterbury, in public meeting assembled, then proceeded <lb/>
to vote their unanimous disapprobation of the school, and <lb/>
their fixed determination to oppose it at all hazards. They <lb/>
certainly opposed it with great vigour, but the hazard was <lb/>
not so much to the town of Canterbury as to the young <lb/>
woman, who was the object for two years of the most <reg orig="re-|lentless">relentless</reg> <lb/>
persecution. She all the while maintained her <lb/>
quiet dignity, causing Garrison to exclaim in a letter to a <lb/>
friend, "Wonderful woman! as undaunted as if she had <lb/>
the whole world on her side! She has opened her school <lb/>
and is resolved to persevere." One of her friends wrote to <lb/>
Garrison: "We shall have a rough time, probably, before <lb/>
the year is out. The struggle will be great, no doubt, but <lb/>
God will redeem the captives. &hellip; We are all determined <lb/>
to sustain Miss Crandall if there is law in the land enough <lb/>
to protect her. She is a noble soul!"</p>
<p>The fight between the heroic little Quaker woman and <lb/>
the town of Canterbury soon waxed very hot. Almost <lb/>
directly after the school was opened in 1833, her enemies <lb/>
procured the passing of an Act by the State Legislature of <lb/>
Connecticut, prohibiting private schools for non-resident <lb/>
coloured persons, and providing for the expulsion of such <lb/>
scholars. The fact is a warning of the way in which small <lb/>
<pb n="227" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0242"/>
local parliaments may be carried away by local passions. <lb/>
Such an Act would probably, even then, never have passed <lb/>
the Legislature of the United States. As it was, its <lb/>
originators must have been ashamed of it as soon as their <lb/>
rage against Miss Crandall had had time to cool, for it was <lb/>
repealed in 1838; but in the five years during which it was <lb/>
in operation it gave Miss Crandall's enemies great power <lb/>
over her. Under this Act she was twice arrested, tried, <lb/>
convicted, and imprisoned. She appealed to the Supreme <lb/>
Court, and had the satisfaction in the superior tribunal of <lb/>
defeating her persecutors, though only on a technical point <lb/>
of law. But in the interval she was subjected to the most <lb/>
extraordinary and inhuman persecution. There was not a <lb/>
shopkeeper in the town who would sell her, or any member <lb/>
of her household, a morsel of food; she and her scholars <lb/>
were not admitted to take part in public worship; no public <lb/>
conveyance would take them as passengers; doctors would <lb/>
not attend them. Miss Crandall's own relations and friends <lb/>
were warned that if they valued their own safety they must <lb/>
not visit her or have anything to do with her. "Her <lb/>
well was filled with manure, and water from other <lb/>
sources was refused; the house itself was smeared with <lb/>
filth, assailed with rotten eggs and stones, and finally set <lb/>
on fire." &lpar;See <hi rend="italic">Life of William Lloyd Garrison,</hi> vol. i. p. <lb/>
321&rpar;. But the little "school-marm" held her own. Unlike <lb/>
that Frenchman of whom we are told that he consecrated a <lb/>
long life to coming invariably to the assistance of the <lb/>
strongest side, she was emphatically the friend of the <lb/>
oppressed, and one of that band "who through faith <reg orig="sub-|dued">subdued</reg> <lb/>
kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, <lb/>
stopped the mouths of lions, quenched the violence of fire, <lb/>
escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made <lb/>
strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of <lb/>
the aliens."</p>
<p>The existence of a group of such women is one of the <lb/>
most precious national possessions of the American people. <lb/>
Miss Crandall, now Mrs. Philleo, is still &lpar;1889&rpar; alive and <lb/>
in full vigour of mind and body. The revenge which the <lb/>
<pb n="228" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0243"/>
whirligig of time has brought to her is the triumph of her <lb/>
cause. She now enjoys a small pension granted to her <lb/>
by the Government of the United States in recognition <lb/>
of her services to the anti-slavery cause.</p>
<p>Another of the famous anti-slavery women of the United <lb/>
States was Lucretia Mott. She, too, was a Quakeress, as <lb/>
were a very considerable proportion of the women who <lb/>
first took up the Abolitionist movement. At one time <lb/>
the Puritan inhabitants of New England, who had fled from <lb/>
their homes in Europe to escape persecution, instituted the <lb/>
most cruel persecution against the Quakers and all sects <lb/>
who differed from the Puritan creed. The persecuted are <lb/>
often only too ready to become persecutors in their turn. <lb/>
Lucretia Mott's ancestors, the Coffins, descended from the <lb/>
ancient Devonshire family of that name, had fled before <lb/>
this Puritan persecution to the island of Nantucket to the <lb/>
east of Massachusetts. Here Lucretia was born in 1793, <lb/>
and here her childhood was passed till she was eleven, when <lb/>
her father removed to Boston, Massachusetts. Lucretia <lb/>
and her younger sister, spoken of in her father's letters as <lb/>
"the desirable little Elizabeth," had opportunities of <reg orig="educa-|tion">education</reg> <lb/>
at Boston that would have been quite out of the <reg orig="ques-|tion">question</reg> <lb/>
in the primitive island of their birth. At the age <lb/>
of eighteen Lucretia married James Mott, and her home <lb/>
henceforward was at Philadelphia. Partly for the sake of <lb/>
educating her own children, and partly with the view of <lb/>
helping her mother, who had been left a widow with five <lb/>
children to support, Lucretia Mott opened a school. When <lb/>
she was about thirty years of age she began gradually to <lb/>
be drawn into work of a more public kind, through her <lb/>
deep interest in many moral movements of her time. <reg orig="Fore-|most">Foremost</reg> <lb/>
among these stood the anti-slavery agitation; she <lb/>
travelled many thousands of miles, speaking and lecturing <lb/>
for the anti-slavery cause. It was then, even in America, <lb/>
quite a novelty for women to take an active part in public <lb/>
movements, and some of the more old-fashioned of the <lb/>
Abolitionists did not approve of the participation of Lucretia <lb/>
Mott and other women in the work. But Garrison was <lb/>
<pb n="229" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0244"/>
always, from the first, as eager for the equality of women <lb/>
as he was for the emancipation of the slaves; and he felt <lb/>
too deeply what the anti-slavery cause in England and <lb/>
America owed to women to tolerate their being set on one <lb/>
side without any recognition of their work. However, at <lb/>
first only a minority held this view, and the difficulty which <lb/>
some men felt in working with women caused Lucretia <lb/>
Mott to form the Philadelphia Female Anti-Slavery Society. <lb/>
At the first meeting of this society, none of the ladies felt <lb/>
competent themselves to take the chair, so they elected a <lb/>
negro gentleman to that position, a choice which Mrs. Mott <lb/>
explained a few years later in the following words: <lb/>
"Negroes, idiots, and women were in legal documents classed <lb/>
together; so that we were very glad to get one of our own <lb/>
class to come and aid us in forming that society."</p>
<p>In 1840 Lucretia Mott was one of the delegates chosen <lb/>
to represent American societies at the World's Anti-Slavery <lb/>
Convention held in London in that year. It is well known <lb/>
that she and all other lady delegates were refused <reg orig="recogni-|tion">recognition</reg> <lb/>
because they were women. Sir John Bowring, Mr. <lb/>
Ashurst, and Daniel O'Connell were among those who <reg orig="pro-|tested">protested</reg> <lb/>
against this arbitrary act of exclusion; but the <reg orig="pro-|test">protest</reg> <lb/>
was in vain. Garrison had not been present when the <lb/>
question of refusing to allow the lady delegates to take <lb/>
part in the Convention was discussed. He arrived in <lb/>
England five days after the question had been settled. <lb/>
With characteristic generosity, he refused to sit as a delegate <lb/>
where the ladies had been excluded. They had been <lb/>
relegated as spectators to a side gallery, and he insisted on <lb/>
taking his seat there also. The absurdity of holding a <lb/>
World's Anti-Slavery Convention in which the chief workers <lb/>
against slavery were present as spectators, not as <reg orig="par-|ticipators">participators</reg>, <lb/>
caused a great deal of discussion at the time; and <lb/>
the general movement in England towards the social, <reg orig="edu-|cational">educational</reg>, <lb/>
and political equality of women may be said to date <lb/>
from that period.</p>
<p>For thirty years Lucretia Mott hardly ever let a day <lb/>
pass without doing something to weaken the fabric of <lb/>
<pb n="230" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0245"/>
slavery, which she felt to be the greatest curse of her native <lb/>
land. Her manner and voice were sweet, solemn, and <lb/>
tranquil; her small and fragile figure, her exquisite <reg orig="woman-|liness">womanliness</reg> <lb/>
of demeanour, made it difficult to believe that she <lb/>
could become the object of violent hatred and persecution. <lb/>
Yet she had often known what it was to stand on a platform <lb/>
in the midst of a shower of stones and vitriol, and to <reg orig="en-|dure">endure</reg> <lb/>
in silence the unmanly insults of the pro-slavery press. <lb/>
The simple and direct sincerity of her mind, her <reg orig="forgetful-|ness">forgetfulness</reg> <lb/>
of self, and her tranquil courage, carried conviction to <lb/>
the minds of thousands that she had a message worth <lb/>
listening to. But at first many even of her own religious <lb/>
community thought it necessary to show their disapprobation <lb/>
of her conduct, by refusing to recognise her when they met. <lb/>
She owned that this "had caused her considerable pain," <lb/>
but it never caused her to swerve for a moment from the <lb/>
course she felt to be that of duty. She usually took a <lb/>
share of the seat behind the door in railway cars, because <lb/>
that place was ordinarily assigned to negroes, and would <lb/>
converse kindly with her fellow-passengers there.</p>
<p>At the celebrated trial in 1859 of Daniel Dangerfield, a <lb/>
fugitive slave, Lucretia Mott remained all through the long <lb/>
hours of suspense by the side of the prisoner. The trial <lb/>
and the courthouse were watched by two crowds, both in <lb/>
the greatest anxiety and suspense, one hoping for the release, <lb/>
the other, and by far the larger and more dangerous, hoping <lb/>
for the condemnation of the man. At last the long trial <lb/>
ended in victory for the right. Daniel Dangerfield was <lb/>
declared a free man; but the authorities of the court <lb/>
thought it would be impossible to get him away in safety <lb/>
through the angry pro-slavery crowd, without an escort <lb/>
of police. Their fears were found to be groundless, for <lb/>
when the doors of the court were thrown open, and the slave <lb/>
walked out, a free man, Lucretia Mott, the aged Quaker <lb/>
lady, was by his side; her hand on his arm was a sufficient <lb/>
protection, and he passed through the angry crowd in safety.</p>
<p>Very soon after this came the War of Secession. The <lb/>
Abolitionists knew, though the politicians did not, that this <lb/>
<pb n="231" entity="Fawcett_SomeEminentWomen_0246"/>
war would decide the question of slavery. As all the world <lb/>
knows now, they were right. The American people were <lb/>
enabled to prevent the secession of the slave states; and <lb/>
in 1863 a proclamation of President Lincoln announced <lb/>
the Abolition of Slavery in the United States. Lucretia <lb/>
Mott lived for seventeen years after this crowning victory <lb/>
of her life's labours. She died on 11th November 1880, <lb/>
universally respected, and loved by those who knew her.</p>
