            <salute>Dear Marcelle:</salute>
        		</opener>
        		
            <p>
            Find one has to
            put postals sent via military
            post under cover.  Hence the
            inclosed [sic].  I’ll mail this in
            regular post to save time.
            </p><p>
            The weather has
            changed and spring in 
            all its beauty is here now.
            Its a shame our Babies haven’t
            yet arrived.  They would
            have served so well this
            morning.  A Boche flew over
            and let us have three
            bombs.  Killed one of our 
            drivers and wounded five
            others.  We could have brought
                        
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0305" n="[p.2]"/>
            
            him down easily if any 
            one of us had had his
            machine.  We had an old
            18 meter Nieuport &mdash; unarmed &mdash;
            we had been flying but
            this morning our boy
            Norman Prince ran into
            the hangars with it and
            smashed her to bits.  He’s
            gone to Paris on noon train.
            If these old pilots are
            no better than he is
            we’re going to have a 
            rotten outfit.
            </p><p>
            This morning I had
            my first chance to practice
            with a Mitrailleuse.
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0304" n="[p.3]"/>
            
            We won’t have an opportunity
            of shooting one from a 
            machine until we actually
            get into a fight.
            </p><p>
            The other day we made
            a tour from Belfort into
            Alsace to look over the
            few landing places that
            exist.  I’ve never had a
            more wonderful tour than
            I did thru [sic] the Vosges.
            The myriades [sic] of little
            glittering cascades that
            tumble down avenues of 
            green from snow capped
            peaks constitute a ravishing
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0306" n="[p.4]"/>
            
            sight.  All the people in 
            Alsace seem Boche, which
            is a bit discouraging
            after looking at romantic
            pictures of vanishing
            frontier posts.  I suppose
            all the real French left
            after 1870.
            </p><p>
            There are lots of
            “poules” in this town.
