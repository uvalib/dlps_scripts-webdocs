                </head>
                <p> Tenney is near the [PawPaw] Tunnel. He muses to Addie about their romance and
                    how wearily the time passes for him. He describes Washington's birthday
                    celebration the previous day with "arches of evergreen, flags raised, and tents
                    wreathed and decorated in a tasteful manner." The Brigade, consisting of the 7th
                    and 29th Ohio, 110th Pa., 7th Indiana and 1st Va. Regiments, was reviewed by
                    General Lander, who said the "7th is the best regiment in his department."
                    However, Tenney adds, all the best officers in the regiment are resigning and
                    going home. Tenney thinks resignations are due to the fact that the regiment
                    head, Maj. Gen. Erastus Barnard Tyler, is a "ruined and unprincipled head." </p>

                <p>Now that you are here before me, can<lb/> we not have a few moments quiet "<hi
                        rend="underline">tete a tete</hi>," all by<lb/> our selves? How does my
                    darling Addie manage<lb/> to pass away the weary monotonous hours which<lb/>
                    seem to lag merely to annoy us? In singing,<lb/> sleighing, and having "good
                    times" I suppose.<lb/> I think I never saw time pass as wearily, as it<lb/> does
                    here. It is a joyous time when the mail comes<lb/> in, and plenty of letters
                    come for us. but then <hi rend="underline">my</hi><lb/> day does not come more
                    than once a week. &amp;<lb/> sometimes <hi rend="underline">it</hi> passes
                    over without <hi rend="underline">my</hi> getting any.<lb/> How glad I was, when
                        Cap <unclear>Asper</unclear> gave me your letter<lb/> yesterday, I can not
                    tell you. You may imagine<lb/> my surprise, and gratification on percieving
                    that<lb/> it contained your miniature. I can only thank<lb/> you now, and hope
                    that I may come home soon<lb/> and repay you better. But it is not <hi
                        rend="underline">one quarter</hi> as<lb/> pretty as the original, but it
                    serves to assure me that <pb n="2" entity="DSSR_000000766_0508"/>
                    <add hand="h1" place="inline">you</add> love me, and I ought to be very
                    grateful.</p>

                <p> How I wish you could converse with me,<lb/> but fate has ordained that I should
                    be a "sojer boy"<lb/> and furloughs cant be obtained always when they<lb/> are
                    wanted. But I shall not be always attached<lb/> to the U.S. Army, and three
                    years will soon pass<lb/> away, then I shall be free once more.</p>
                <p> Well Addie, I must tell you of yesterday.<lb/> Great preparations were made at
                    the order of "<hi rend="underline">Major<lb/> Gen Tyler</hi>" (as Creighton
                    calls him) day before yesterday<lb/> to celebrate Washington's Birthday. Arches
                    of<lb/> evergreen were erected. Flag poles <del hand="h1">raised</del><lb/> were
                    raised, and tents were wreathed &amp;<lb/> decorated in a tasteful manner,
                    and every<lb/> thing was arranged in tip top order. At<lb/> 11 A.M. yesterday,
                    the Brigade consisting of<lb/> the 7<hi rend="super">th</hi> &amp; 29<hi
                        rend="super">th</hi> O. 110<hi rend="super">th</hi> Pa. 7<hi rend="super"
                    >th</hi> Ind. &amp;1<hi rend="super">st</hi> Va. Regts<lb/> was drawn up in
                    line, near our camp<lb/> and were reviewed by Col. Buckley of the<lb/> 29<hi
                        rend="super">th</hi>, then by Gen. Lander in person.<lb/> Gen. Lander says
                    the 7<hi rend="super">th</hi> is the best Regt.<lb/> in his department. Quite a
                    compliment<lb/> was it not? He made us a short speech<lb/>
                    <pb n="3" entity="DSSR_000000766_0509"/> after the Review, in which he promised
                    us soon<lb/> a "forward movement."</p>
                <p> What do you think our Regt. is com<add place="inline" hand="h1">ing</add><lb/>
                    to. All of our best officers are resigning and<lb/> going home. First Chaplain
                    Brown. then<lb/> Hal. Now Lieut. Kimball of Co. A. &amp; Adjt.
                    DeForrest<lb/> have resigned &amp; it is reported the Major is about<lb/>
                    to. &amp; I <hi rend="underline">know</hi> Col. Creighton intends to as
                    soon<lb/> as he can get any pretence. It is too bad,<lb/> I declare, that a
                    first class Regt. must go to ruin<lb/> merely because a ruined &amp;
                    unprincipled man<lb/> is at the head. If some energetic officer would<lb/> take
                    the affair into his own hands, &amp; <orig reg="proffer">profer</orig> a<lb/>
                    list of charges (which could <hi rend="underline">easily</hi> be prepared)
                    against<lb/> Tyler, and <hi rend="underline">not be afraid of losing his own
                        epau<lb/> lettes</hi>, our regt. would be soon rid of the scheming<lb/>
                    politician &amp; have a <hi rend="underline">man</hi> for a leader. But so
                    long<lb/> as we are tied down by such line officers as Asper<lb/> Wood, W.R.
                    Sterling &amp; Capt. Crane, who are afraid to<lb/> assert their own
                    independence for fear that they<lb/> may lose their glittering shoulder straps
                    &amp; the<lb/> attendant salary, so long must we be down-<lb/> trodden: Yet
                        Tyler <hi rend="underline">will</hi> cajole &amp; flatter, &amp; promise<lb/>
                    <pb n="4" entity="DSSR_000000766_0510"/> all sorts of "Laurels," and a few will
                    cheer for<lb/> the "Gallant Col." He made a short speech yesterday<lb/> which he
                    intended should be cheered. What must<lb/> have been his feelings when <hi
                        rend="underline">not a <unclear/> was<lb/> raised, nor a cheer given for him
                        from the 7<hi rend="super">th</hi></hi></p>
                <p> But I must bring this to a close<lb/> You must write very often Addie love. just
                    as<lb/> often as you please. &amp; I will endeavor to return<lb/> as many
                    letters as you send. <hi rend="underline">if not more</hi>.<lb/> I wrote you a
                    letter the 13<hi rend="super">th</hi> which you could<lb/> not have recieved
                    when you wrote. but. my<lb/> request was granted in <hi rend="underline">one</hi>
                    manner. Is it<lb/> in the <hi rend="underline">other</hi>? I leave it all to you
                    now Addie.<lb/> darling. will you <del hand="h1">complete</del> the arrangements</p>
