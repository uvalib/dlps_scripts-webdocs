                        <p>The President told the Board that the John Paul Jones Arena has been

                              this naming took place in Los Angeles on the evening of February 8th.
                              It is a prestigious award and the President complimented the staff who
                              made this possible. </p>

                              <head>THE UNIVERSITY ORIGINAL LABOR FORCE</head>
                              <p> At an earlier meeting of the Board, the President noted, he had
                                    informed Members of plans to commemorate the University original
                                    labor force. These plans have advanced with the appointment of
                                    two committees, both chaired by Brian Hogg, Senior Preservation
                                    Planner in the Office of the University Architect. The first of
                                    these committees has completed its work, which was to design a
                                    marker to honor the efforts of these anonymous workers, and to
                                    devise the wording and placement of the marker. The committee
                                    has proposed a slate memorial, to be placed in the brick
                                    pavement of the passage under the south terrace of the Rotunda,
                                    the passage which leads to the principal entrance of the
                                    building. </p>
                              <p> The second committee is charged with conducting research to
                                    identify the enslaved workers and other persons of color who
                                    participated in building the University original buildings and
                                    grounds. It is proposed that the names of these people and
                                    information about their roles be incorporated into a
                                    commemorative and interpretive site that will be part of Phase
                                    II of the South Lawn Project. </p>
                              <p> The President said the Buildings and Grounds Committee has
                                    approved the wording of the commemorative marker; the Committee
                                    resolution, which will be brought to the full Board for approval
                                    later in the meeting, and which includes the proposed wording,

                                          indicate the Program of which it is a part. For example,
                                          the internal designations may be "Series A-1 (Tax-Exempt)"

                                          complete the form of such Note. </p>

                                          the maturity date and interest rate for such Notes in
                                          accordance with this Section. The Dealer shall determine
                                          the maturity date of each Note on the date of issuance of
                                          such Note to be the date that, in the judgment of the
                                          Dealer as of the date of determination, when considered
                                          together with the maturity dates of other Notes, produces
                                          the greatest likelihood of the lowest net interest cost on
                                          the Notes to the University during each year. </p>
                                    <p> It is recognized that (a) the Dealer may, in the exercise of
                                          its judgment, determine maturities for Notes that result
                                          in interest rates on Notes that are higher than those that
                                          would be borne by Notes with other maturity dates in order
                                          to increase the likelihood of achieving the lowest overall
                                          debt service cost on the Notes to the University and (b)
                                          in view of the uncertainties involved in forecasting
                                          interest rates, the Dealer may establish different
                                          maturities for Notes on the same date in order to achieve
                                          an average of maturities that, in its judgment, is most
                                          likely to achieve the lowest debt service on the Notes.
                                          The determination of maturity dates for Notes by the
                                          Dealer as herein provided shall be based upon the market

                                          such date to the extent possible, taking into account the
                                          maturity dates of Commercial Paper Notes then Outstanding. </p>
                                    <p> Each Note shall bear interest at the rate determined by the
                                          Dealer on or before the date of issuance thereof to be the
                                          minimum rate that, in the judgment of the Dealer, would
                                          enable the Dealer to sell such Commercial Paper Note on

                                          that different interest rates may be determined for Notes
                                          maturing on the same date. Interest on Series A
                                          (Tax-Exempt) Notes shall be calculated on the basis of the

                                          366 days (as the case may be). Such interest shall be
                                          payable on the maturity date of such Notes. Series A
                                          (Tax-Exempt) Notes may only be sold at a price equal to

                                    <p> Interest on Series B (Taxable) Notes shall be calculated on

                                          containing twelve 30-day months. Such interest shall be
                                          payable on the maturity date of such Notes. Series B
                                          (Taxable) Notes may be sold at a price equal to the

                                          same manner as the definitive Notes. If the University
                                          issues temporary Notes it will execute and deliver
                                          definitive Notes as promptly thereafter as practicable,
                                          and thereupon the temporary Notes may be surrendered, for

                                          The establishment of a new Program, in and of itself,

                                    <p> (b) A Program may be established from time to time to
                                          succeed another Program. On and after the date a new
                                          Program is established hereunder, no Notes may be issued
                                          under a prior Program; however, Notes may be issued to
                                          refund Notes under the prior Program and Outstanding Notes
                                          issued under a prior Program shall continue to be subject
                                          to the terms and provisions of this Resolution until their
                                          maturity date. It is the intention of the University that
                                          all Series 2003A Notes issued under a Program, as a part
                                          of one or more Series, for a period not greater than the
                                          18-month period beginning on the date of the first
                                          issuance of Series A (Tax-Exempt) Notes under such Program
                                          (such period, the "New Money Issuance Period") shall
                                          constitute a single issue under the Code. Under each
                                          Program, Series A (Tax-Exempt) Notes may be issued during
                                          the New Money Issuance Period to finance or refinance (i)
                                          Costs of the Projects, (ii) certain costs of issuance of
                                          the Series A (Tax-Exempt) Notes or (iii) Series A
                                          (Tax-Exempt) Notes issued under such Program or a prior
                                          Program. After the New Money Issuance Period, Series A
                                          (Tax-Exempt) Notes may be issued under a Program only to
                                          refinance Notes previously issued under that Program. </p>

                                          103(a) of the Code by reason of classification of such
                                          Series A (Tax-Exempt) Note as a "private activity bond,"

                                          shall give such notice (or shall cause the Issuing and
                                          Paying Agent to give such notice) as he or she may deem
                                          appropriate of the fixing of any such date and shall not
                                          be required to make payment to the holder of any Note
                                          until such Note shall be surrendered to the trustee or any

                                          this Section 7.3 shall be interpreted so that term "Notes"

                                          Obligations. In each resolution authorizing the issuance
                                          of any Parity Credit Obligation, the University agrees to
                                          provide for the trustee thereunder to be the same as the
