            <salute>Dear Marcelle:</salute>

            <p>
            Paul returned
            shortly after you left
            last night.  The poor
            boy is very despondent
            and all interest in life
            seems to have left
            him.
            </p><p>
            Kiffin attacked the
            German at an altitude of
            3,500 meters.  The Boche
                        
            <pb n="[p.2]"/>
            
            was one of their new
            ones which carries a
            pilot and two machine
            gunners.  It is very fast
            and deadly.  Two other
            French machines had been
            brought down near where
            Kiffin fell in the same 
            hour.  A French Commandant
            who had watched the combat
            said that Kiffin had attacked
            at such close range that
                        
            <pb n="[p.3]"/>
            
            he thought he had run
            into the German.  Then 
            Kiffin’s machine fell on its
            nose, the wings on one 
            side came off and he
            dropped.  He fell into a
            field of flowers just
            back of the trenches.  An
            explosive bullet had hit
            him in the chest.  An
            ordinary one, so a Major
            who examined him said,
            would have given him an
            
            <pb n="[p.4]"/>
            
            even chance for his life.
            </p><p>
            I have never appreciated
            you so much as I did
            last night.  I felt how
            wonderful you are.
            </p><p>
            Mrs. Weeks and Paul
            are very grateful to you
            and your mother.  They talk
            of you all the time and
            how sweet you have been.
            </p>
