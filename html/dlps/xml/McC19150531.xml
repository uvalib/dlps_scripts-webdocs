            <p>
            I’m so anxious to hear
            from you after Curtin’s
            farewell visit.  He might
            have told a lot of things
            you know.  Oh, I’m not
            worrying about that_
            only curious.  For
            twelve days now the
            postal service hasn’t
            been working as far
            as we’re concerned and
            I’ve received no letters
            at all.
            </p>
        		<p>
            A great deal of fighting
            has been going on of
            late and our work has
            been so heavy that I’ve
            found no time to write.
            We’ve broken all records
                        
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0088" n="[p.2]"/>
            
            for American Ambulance
            sections and the
            officers here are seemingly
            very well pleased with 
            our work.  In fact we
            have been recommended
            for mention in the Order
            of the Day.  What do 
            you know about that
            Ma Chere Mademoiselle
            Marcelle?
        		</p>
        		<p>
            By the way.  Do
            you still entertain a 
            desire to work up
            front or are you
            satisfied at Neuilly?
            I ask, for I understand
            that nurses would be
            welcomed here and God
            knows they are terribly
                        
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0089" n="[p.3]"/>
            
            needed.  If you wish
            I will go more carefully
            into the matter for
            you.  The town is 
            delightful and I’m
            sure you would enjoy
            the river and above
            all the gardens.  Then
            too your work would
            give you a feeling of
            satisfaction; a realization
            that you were helping
            France every minute.  Of
            course there is one
            draw back and that is
            that you wouldn’t be
            so very comfortable
            and then again there
            are the bombardments
            which might prove
                        
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0090" n="[p.4]"/>
            
            more or less annoying.
            Still, while thirty-one
            people were killed and
            fifty wounded in a
            short bombardment
            four days ago I 
            nevertheless think that
            they are slowing up.
            They certainly aren’t as
            bad as they used to be.
            Besides in a hospital
            you are comparatively
            safe.
        		</p>
        		<p>
            That reminds me.  I
            got hit by shrapnel
            the other day but didn’t
            get hurt much.  I was 
            up at the most advanced
            Poste de Secours, next to
            a battery when the
                        
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0091" n="[p.5]"/>
            
            Germans began shooting
            shrapnel at the artillery
            position.  The blooming
            things were zizz-zizz
            zizz--ker-bang ing
            all over the place and
            one shell went thru [sic]
            a tree ten feet off.
            The first thing I knew
            was that something
            poked me a jab in
            the back over my kidneys
            and I staggered a bit
            from the shock.  A
            lieutenant asked me if
            I was wounded and 
            came over to me.  It was
            a huge joke for I 
            reached around and pulled
            out a bit of the shrapnel
                        
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0092" n="[p.6]"/>
            
            casing that hadn’t gone
            into me at all.  It
            just went thru [sic] my
            uniform and when it
            encountered my tough
            hide couldn’t go any
            further.  All I received
            was a bloody bruise
            that’s nearly well now.
            Another fellow was with
            me and his car was
            quite badly cut up by
            the same shell.
        		</p>
        		<p>
            I hate to see these
            bombardments.  It isn’t
            bad being under fire
            out where the fighting
            is going on, for the
            thing is part of the 
            game and the atmosphere
                        
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0093" n="[p.7]"/>
            
            is entirely military, but
            here in town where
            no one is getting back
            at the Boches it seems
            out of place.  One may
            buy cakes from a woman
            in the morning and
            haul her out a bloody
            mess in the afternoon.
            The other day a fellow
            named Dunning and I
            had the pleasant job
            of breaking open a store
            window and getting out
            three hideous looking
            corpses.  The blood had
            run from the room under
            the door to the <reg orig="side=|walk">sidewalk</reg>
            and was in a
            great pool outside.  Two
                        
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0094" n="[p.8]"/>
            
            women and a soldier
            were lying in the
            awkward postures of
            those suddenly killed.
            All of the face of one
            woman was shot away
            save an eye and that
            looked up at us.  As
            we picked her up her
            combs fell out and her
            bloody hair fell backward.
            It was terrible.

            you.
