            Dear Miss Guerin:
            </salute></opener>
        		
        		<p>
            I hope I’m not boring 
            you by writing, but you see since
            they’ve put me on a car here I
            am seldom fortunate enough to be
            in time for seeing you at mess
            and this is the only way I have
            of bringing you nearer to me, as it
            were.  If it gives me a certain amount
            of happiness to talk to you on
            paper, you won’t begrudge me the 
            pleasure will you?
        		</p>
        		<p>
            I have to be in readiness
            all the time and can’t even look
            forward with any degree of certainty
            to even a glimpse of you.  Yesterday
            I saw you returning from your walk.
            You had a cute, blue coat on, and
            (over)
            
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0002" n="[p.2]"/>
            
            a blue head veil.  To day I had hoped
            to see you, for last night I got my
            first typhoid treatment and felt
            a bit stiff; but no such luck;
            we got a call for La Chapelle at 11
            and of course didn’t get back in
            time.
        		</p>
        		<p>
            I suppose you know all about everything
            that goes on in connection with the arrival
            of the wounded and sick, but maybe
            you haven’t been to the station and
            seen the poor fellows coming in.  Its
            very interesting.  One would feel sad
            were it not for the fact that one
            realizes the men are pleased at
            getting out alive and are to have
            a rest.  Yesterday at La Chapelle a
            large number arrived.  There was one, an 
            officer, that had brought a little skye
            terrier with him from Ypres.  He had
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0003" n="[p.3]"/>
            
            the little fellow in a sack
            under his coat, and when those
            angel nurses passed sandwiches to 
            the men the little dog set up an awful
            yell because he didn’t get one.  His
            nose was cold so I guess he was
            well.  The master told me that at
            one time they were opposed by Austrians
            and that they used saw bayonets.
            They had been faced by Bavarian troops
            at one time who had asked them not
            to fire, saying that in a day or two
            Prussians would take their place and
            to save the ammunition for use against 
            them.
        		</p>
        		<p>
            There is a black curtain wall between
            the train and the distributing room, where 
            the soldiers are gathered around glowing
            over
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0004" n="[p.4]"/>
            
            braziers, and it gives a theatrical effect,
            (a la Carb) to have the curtain part
            and a line of brancairdiers emerge.
        		</p>
        		<p>
            Today three Germans were brought
            in.  Everyone came running up whispering
            “Trois Boches” and craning their necks to
            get a good view.  The French were
            good to them.  They handled them
            carefully, and gave them food.  There
            were two ^ French officers ^also; one a Captain and
            the other a Commandant <unclear>G--</unclear>  The
            latter had been summoned from China,
            and just as soon as he had arrived 
            at Marseilles they had sent him to
            the northern front.  Naturally his health
            broke down.  On the way to Val de Grace
            he needs must have the name on his
            trunk hidden and though he could sit
            up and take notice he insisted the
            back of the ambulance be closed.  At
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0005" n="[p.5]"/>
            
            Val de Grace he told the
            Captain good bye.  They 
            cried, and it was touching.  We took
            him then to St Joseph and there
            he held forth at length on the war,
            on the goodness of Americans&mdash;ourselves
            in particular, Nota <unclear>bene [?]</unclear>, and was profuse
            in his thanks.  A fine man the Commandant
            and a great pleasure to meet.  Think
            he had not seen his wife in two and
            a half years and wasn’t allowed to
            go directly to her.  I offered to take 
            him there but he said it was against
            the rules.
        		</p>
        		<p>
            I wondered if you saw the two
            aeroplanes that flew above the hospital
            today.  They were beautiful.  Fenton wanted
            a red cross band sewed onto his sleeve
                        
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0006" n="[p.6]"/>
            
            and I eagerly grasped the opportunity
            to guide him to the sewing room,
            which is en face to the New 
            York ward.  I had hopes&mdash; but
            nothing came of it, as you know.
        		</p>
        		<p>
            Fenton also was the means of
            conveying a message to the effect 
            that you had not seen me at
            noon mess, but it was fortunate
            as you didn’t want to be 
            bothered.  I just missed you at
            the <unclear>ba [?]</unclear> to day during which you
            imparted that information.
