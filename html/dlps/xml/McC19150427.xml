            <p>
            One of our supply
            cars came out to
            day and so I am
            sending this note
            to you by the 
            driver.
            </p>
        		<p>
            I have written you
            several times but
            don’t know if you
            received any of the
            letters.  Did you 
            get the one I sent
            from Vittel?  Old
            Rockwell wrote me
            and said he’d seen you<unclear>[.]</unclear>
            It seemed good to
            get even that indirect
            news of you.
        		</p>
        		<p>
            We’re getting it worse
            at our base at <unclear>Dieulouard [sp?]</unclear>
                        
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0038" n="[p.2]"/>
            
            now than at 
            our advance point,
            Pont a Mousson.  The
            Germans opened up
            yesterday and twenty
            four shells came in.
            The nearest to us
            was thirty yards
            A young man was
            killed and seventeen
            people wounded.

            Its wonderful the
            way artillery can
            shoot.  They seem to
            be able to place a
            shot within a twenty
            yards' radius from
            a distance of 10 kilometer
            I had some very exciting
            work during the

            bombardment.
        		</p>
        		<p>
            Curtin and I took
            a walk the other
            day and came
            upon two old
            women spading their
            little vinyard [sic].  They
            thought we were 
            Prussians and were
            terrified.  We talked
            to them in French
            to calm them&mdash;my
            French would calm
            anything&mdash;and then
            spaded their ground
            for half an hour
            to square ourselves.
                        
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0040" n="[p.4]"/>
            
            I have but a few
            minutes here and
            must close this
            uninteresting letter.

            Do call me Jim
