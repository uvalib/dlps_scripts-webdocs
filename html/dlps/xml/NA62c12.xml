     <lb/>
     <salute>My Darling</salute>
    </opener>

    <p>I can wait no longer <lb/> for a letter from you<unclear>.</unclear> but must <lb/> continue
     to keep you my debter<unclear>..</unclear>
     <lb/> I must ask you dear one the <lb/> same question which you asked me <lb/> in the winter
     Have I offended <lb/> you the reason that you do not <lb/> write? Almost two weeks have fled
     <lb/> since I <sic>recieved</sic> your last "angel visit<unclear>..</unclear>" <lb/> Do you
     know how sad and lonely I <lb/> feel when such a long time passes with <lb/> out hearing from
     you? Darling, <hi rend="underline">please</hi> write <lb/> often<unclear>..</unclear> I should
     love to <sic>recieve</sic> letters <lb/>
     <pb n="2" entity="DSSR_000000766_0096"/> from you daily<unclear>..</unclear></p>
    <p>How muddy the roads are here now<unclear>.</unclear>
     <lb/> the frost is all out of the ground<unclear>.</unclear> but <lb/> the roads have not as
     yet got settled <lb/> You was here last spring when the roads <lb/> broke
     up<unclear>.</unclear> think of the roads then and <lb/> now<unclear>.</unclear> but they are
     not quite so bad <lb/> now as they were then<unclear>..</unclear> I am with <lb/> Dora today
     and have been since day <lb/> before yesterday<unclear>..</unclear> I intended going home <lb/>
     yesterday, but it was so bad going <lb/> that I did not go. Dora says I shall <lb/> not go till
     sunday. How odd she <lb/> does look, here, attending to her <lb/> domestic duties. Wish you
     could see <lb/> her you would laugh<unclear>..</unclear> I did not <lb/> think last
      fall<unclear>.</unclear> that she could <lb/> ever become contented and sober <lb/> enough to
     "keep house" but I <lb/> was mistaken. If you could <lb/> see her commanding her Regt. <lb/> of
     pots and kettles<unclear>.</unclear> you would <lb/>
     <pb n="3" entity="DSSR_000000766_0097"/> be almost tempted to ask her <lb/> to show you her
     diploma.</p>

    <p>I am going home again to <unclear>live.</unclear>
     <lb/> our school closed two weeks ago to- <lb/> morrow. Hallie has not been home <lb/> for a
     good while I wish very much <lb/> to see him<unclear>.</unclear> but do not expect to at <lb/>
     present. Hal. intended renting a <lb/> house in Warren and having Laura <lb/> and I live with
      him<unclear>.</unclear> and I was <lb/> going to school<unclear>.</unclear> but he could <lb/>
     get no house hence we were dis- <lb/> appointed. Laurie and I would <lb/> have gone to
      <unclear>Oberlin</unclear> if we had <lb/> not expected to go<del hand="h1"><unclear>[unclear]</unclear></del> to
     Warren. <lb/> Oh<unclear>.</unclear> well<unclear>.</unclear> it only served to <lb/> show us
     that we were doomed <lb/> to disappointment in this life<unclear>..</unclear>
     <lb/> I do not feel very well this <lb/> week. I have a severe cold and <lb/> my throat
     troubles me some in <lb/> consequence<unclear>.</unclear> but shall be<del hand="h1"
     ><unclear>[unclear]</unclear></del> better <pb n="4" entity="DSSR_000000766_0098"/> in a few
     days<unclear>.</unclear> I trust<unclear>.</unclear> It is nothing serious<unclear>.</unclear>
     so do not be <lb/> alarmed dearest. How is your health <lb/> dear one. It has been so long
     since <lb/> I have heard from you that I <lb/> fear you are ill<unclear>..</unclear> You would
     certainly <lb/> inform me if you was not well<unclear>.</unclear> would <lb/> you not Charlie.</p>

    <p>Oh I attended a school exhibition <lb/> tuesday afternoon here at the corners <lb/> They has
     as good a paper as I ever <lb/> heard read. <unclear/> Sarah <unclear>Logan</unclear> was <lb/>
     editress. One piece entitled "fifty- <lb/> years ahead." was excellent<unclear>..</unclear> I
     guess <lb/> old Mecca can boast of at least <lb/> one genius<unclear>..</unclear></p>
    <p>Dearest Charlie I must beg of you <lb/> to excuse this poor apology for a <lb/> letter for I
     have a violent head <lb/> ache. I should not have written <lb/> to day but duty commanded me
     <lb/> to. Please write immediately my darling <lb/> and <sic>recieve</sic> the blessing of your</p>
    <closer>
     <signed>Addie</signed>
    </closer>
