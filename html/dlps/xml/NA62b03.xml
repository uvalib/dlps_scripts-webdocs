                    <salute>Dearest,</salute>
                    <lb/>
                </opener>

                <p> How thankful I was<lb/> tonight, when handed you dear<lb/> letter, and then the
                    dear thoughts<lb/> - your own thoughts - my darling - that it<lb/> contained.
                    Also the beautiful sketch<lb/> which you sent me. Thanks, are but<lb/> a poor
                    recompense for such treasures<lb/> but you know they are the best I can<lb/>
                    afford. "these hard times".</p>
                <p> Do you think these beautiful days<lb/> (although it has not been as
                    pleasant<lb/> to day) weary and monotonous? Ble&longs;s you<lb/> my darling,
                    I had thought them<lb/>
                    <pb n="2" entity="DSSR_000000766_0048"/> very, very short and pleasant. There
                    is<lb/> but one thing which keeps me from being<lb/> truly happy, and that is
                    the return,<lb/> of that one who is dearer to me than<lb/> life. Why should I
                    not be happy now,<lb/> dearest, happy in your love, but there<lb/> is an
                    irresistable desire within my<lb/> breast, for your presence, which I can
                    not<lb/> conquer. and yet I am happy as the<lb/> word is generally expressed and
                    yet<lb/> I can no say that I am really con-<lb/> tented. I sometimes feel as the
                    little<lb/> riverlet appears. It seems to know<lb/> that there is a large body
                    of water<lb/> waiting and anxious to receive it,<lb/> Thus it is with me. I seem
                    to think<lb/> that there is a nobler better being,<lb/> whose love is a strong
                    unceasing tide<lb/> waiting for the time when he can<lb/> call me his own.
                    Therefore I can<lb/> scarcely keep from wishing that time<lb/> (not water) would
                    flow more swiftly.<lb/> So you received the picture did you? <pb n="3"
                        entity="DSSR_000000766_0049"/> I felt quite flattered when I read your<lb/>
                    thoughts if it. Indeed dearest I think<lb/> you must have forgotton how
                    your<lb/> Addie looks for people told me here<lb/> that the portrait was -
                    prettier than the<lb/> original and - was I foolish.<unclear>...</unclear>
                    I<lb/> believed it. Can it be that I have<lb/> changed so much since last
                    June?<lb/> </p>
                    
                    <p>I confess I feel changed for 
                        circumstan<add place="top" hand="author">ces</add>
                    <lb/> have transpired since then which have<lb/> cruelly and deeply
                    wounded my pride.<lb/> But I will not fill up these lines<lb/> with gloomy
                    thoughts.</p>
                <p> Dearest, what frightful reports came<lb/> to town this morning that there
                    had<lb/> been a battle on the Potomac and<lb/> forty thousand<add place="inline"
                        hand="h1">
                        <unclear>southerners</unclear>
                    </add> killed and wounded. I<lb/> was over to Miss Leaslie's when I heard<lb/>
                    of it. I sprang and uttered some<lb/> exclamations, I know not what, and
                    fell<lb/> back, Oh! heavens! the agony of that mom-<lb/> ent. The boy that
                    brought the report<lb/> said that the Seveneth suffered the<lb/> most of any of
                    the army. Dora was frightened<lb/> at my paleness. She, dear good girl,<lb/>
                    <pb n="4" entity="DSSR_000000766_0050"/> "would not belive one word of it"
                    "It<lb/> was all false, just told to frighten folks<lb/> " How I thanked her for
                    the little hope she<lb/> breathed to me. My excitement soon fled<lb/> and
                    tonight I too can repeat<lb/> her words for the paper contains no such
                    report<lb/> At that moment I dared not breathe my<lb/> fears but she read them
                    and tried to quiet<lb/> them. By the way Charly you remember the<lb/> playful
                    little title I<unclear>....</unclear> to designate<lb/> her by "My wife" she
                    will not allow one<lb/> to hold one now she says she has obtained<lb/> a divorce
                        because<unclear>.....</unclear> But what an interesting letter I am<lb/>
                    writing to you am I not. How sorry I<lb/> am that the officers are resigning in
                    the<lb/> Seventh. I certianly do not wish to<lb/>
