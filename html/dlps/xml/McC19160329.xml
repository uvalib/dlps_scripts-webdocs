            <salute>Dear Marcelle:</salute>
        		</opener>
        		
            <p>
            I received your sweet
            letter this morning &mdash; the
            letter you wrote when you
            thought Betty was dead.  You
            have a wonderful character.  You
            put yourself "in rapport" with
            one so beautifully.  Of course
            I’m very happy now, having
            believed Betty dead and finding
            her living.  The reaction has
            been so great that I’m filled
            with joy in spite of the
            fact that the little girl is
            so seriously wounded.  You 
            see that having believed her
            dead and finding her living
            overshadows everything else.
            The only trouble is not being
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0285" n="[p.2]"/>
            
            able to get any news.  Winereux
            is in the army zone and
            no wires can go through.  In
            the paper this morning (La France
            of Bordeaux) I noted that the
            Professor expected to return to
            Paris in a few days.  That 
            is of course encouraging and
            means that his daughter is
            expected to recover.
            </p><p>
            Do you know I’m rather
            pleased that the notice in
            the Herald anent the 7,000
            feet fall of the aeroplane [sic]
            made you worry about me.
            No.  I’m not guilty.  It
            was a fellow named Le Comte
            that fell.  He was an elive
            pilote and making an altitude.
            He fainted, or went wrong
            someway [sic], at the height.  Of
            course the paper got it all
            wrong.  He wasn’t on a fast
            machine.  He was on a Bleriot.
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0284" n="[p.3]"/>
            
            Then again the machine wasn’t
            saved.  It was broken to
            bits.  Haviland, who was the
            first to reach him, after
            picking out the pilot, pulled
            out a stancion of the cabine
            that was embedded two feet
            in the earth.  That was all
            that was left of the plane.
            The pilot was of course very
            fortunate not to have been    
            killed &mdash; the machine landed on
            its back &mdash; but it was a
            miracle.  Just to night one
            of the fellows has returned
            from seeing him at the 
            hospital.  His hair has turned
            grey.  His eyes have a dull,
            senseless look, and he does
            not recollect much of his
            former life.  He does not know
            who he is, and he stoops.
            And when he stoops his
            mouth opens and he looks silly.
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0286" n="[p.4]"/>
            
            They say he will always
            stoop.  Considering it all in
            all it might have been better 
            had he been killed the way
            another fellow was that same
            day &mdash; on the spot.  I wonder
            if Betty will have any
            permanent injury.
