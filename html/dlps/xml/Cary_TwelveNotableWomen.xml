<head><hi rend="bold">INTRODUCTION</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">In</hi> ancient and modern Syria&mdash;that land of historic <lb/>
and sacred memories&mdash;the name of "lady" is <lb/>
unknown, and is only expressed by the term "a <lb/>
virtuous woman"; and yet what truer and nobler <lb/>
definition can be given, for, as Solomon tells us, a <lb/>
virtuous woman "is far above rubies."</p>
<p>And so, from time to time, on our little world-stage <lb/>
there enters, one by one, some representative living <lb/>
personality to play her part in the great life-drama.</p>
<p>It is the old, the ever new, parable of the talents <lb/>
over again,&mdash;"to whom much is given, of him shall <lb/>
much be required;" and yet how various are <lb/>
the gifts, how diversified and unequal the <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italic">r&ocirc;le</hi></foreign>, the <lb/>
<foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italic">r&eacute;pertoire</hi></foreign>!</p>
<p>Rich indeed is our record in the Victorian era, <lb/>
when our crowned Lady leads the van,&mdash;when a <lb/>
saintly Elizabeth Fry trod the murky purlieus of <lb/>
Newgate, and raised fallen and degraded <reg orig="woman-|kind">womankind</reg> <lb/>
by her angel message of pity and love. And <lb/>
not far behind her moved that dear "Lady with <lb/>
the Lamp," revered and beloved by every English <lb/>
<pb n="10" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0021"/>
heart&mdash;Florence Nightingale; and following them a <lb/>
noble little band of workers.</p>
<p>And it is the parable again&mdash;the many, the few. <lb/>
Not all are called to be pioneers, or to go down <lb/>
into the heat of the battle. There are some that <lb/>
must watch beside the tents, faithful in little, <lb/>
faithful in much; and yet we may believe that their <lb/>
recording angels have written their names in letters <lb/>
of gold.</p>
<p>"Write me as one who loves his fellow-men," said <lb/>
Abu Ben Adhem; and surely it might be written <lb/>
of the leal-hearted Scotch lassie who manned the <lb/>
lifeboat when the ship was sinking, or of Agnes <lb/>
Weston working year after year amongst her beloved <lb/>
blue-jackets; and so on with each one of our <lb/>
notable good women. "There is none good," said <lb/>
the Master; but the term is only used here in a <lb/>
relative sense, to express the idea of those who <lb/>
have discharged their duty, redeemed their pledge, <lb/>
fought the good fight, and kept in the right path, <lb/>
&mdash;true-hearted and virtuous women in the noble <lb/>
Syriac sense, which is far nobler than the old Saxon <lb/>
definition of lady&mdash;"<hi rend="italic">hl&acirc;fweardige</hi>"&mdash;bread-keeper.</p>
<p>There are some of us who think there is too little <lb/>
reticence and reserve at the present day, too much <lb/>
publicity,&mdash;as though one lived with open doors, in <lb/>
Japanese fashion. There is nothing kept sacred; <lb/>
everywhere there is the beat of drums, the flourish <lb/>
of trumpets; from the favoured housetops a herald <lb/>
seems perpetually crying, "Oyez! good people, this <lb/>
<pb n="11" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0022"/>
is to give notice!" and so on. And through the <lb/>
length and breadth of the land it passes, from <lb/>
mouth to mouth, spreads like wildfire&mdash;tittle-tattle, <lb/>
canard, topic of the day&mdash;interviewer and journalist <lb/>
all are tiptoe and agog for the latest tit-bit; and <lb/>
Mercury wears his fool's cap and bells, and has a <lb/>
suit of motley.</p>
<p>This, too, is true, and cannot be repudiated; but <lb/>
notwithstanding, there is one saving clause in this <lb/>
document of human infatuation&mdash;the strength and <lb/>
power of example, the light that shines from the <lb/>
unhidden candlestick&mdash;and this we must not deny. <lb/>
There is no such anomaly in nature as isolated good <lb/>
deeds; one might as well throw stones into a pond <lb/>
and expect no eddies or circles, as believe that <lb/>
good works may be done without influencing that <lb/>
generation. If "their works do follow the blessed <lb/>
dead" into the unseen life, most assuredly their <lb/>
potency and force are wide-spreading here, and the <lb/>
circles overlap each other and widen out, as they <lb/>
do on the watery bosom of the stream.</p>
<p>So, as men place finger-posts where intersecting <lb/>
roads meet, to point the way clearly, may these <lb/>
sketches of twelve noble and useful lives be read <lb/>
and studied by the women of this generation, and <lb/>
"go and do thou likewise" be written upon some <lb/>
true heart.</p>

</epigraph>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">There</hi> was a striking sentence written some twelve <lb/>
years ago by Dr. Macaulay, to this effect:&mdash; <lb/>
"When the time comes for the history of the reign of <lb/>
Queen Victoria to be written, it will be found that no equal <lb/>
epoch since the commencement of the Christian era&mdash; <lb/>
except, perhaps, that which includes the discovery of <lb/>
America, the invention of printing, and the Reformation&mdash; <lb/>
has been so full of important events, affecting the condition <lb/>
and progress of the human race.&hellip; In the advancement <lb/>
of science," he goes on to say, "and its application to the <lb/>
arts; in the subjugation of nature to the use of man; all <lb/>
around us and in our daily life, we see the results of <lb/>
<pb n="16" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0027"/>
material progress. Nor is the advance less marked in social <lb/>
and moral, in educational and religious life."</p>
<p>"In Queen Victoria," said Lord Macaulay, "her subjects <lb/>
have found a wiser, gentler, happier Elizabeth "&mdash;and this, <lb/>
too, is pregnant with truth. The whole life of our beloved <lb/>
Queen, as we know it up to the present day, is a Royal Idyll, <lb/>
noble in its simplicity, its truth, its purity; and as child, <lb/>
crowned maiden, wife, mother, and widowed ruler, she alike <lb/>
claims our reverence and love.</p>
<p>It was a blessed day for England, that 24th of May, 1819, <lb/>
when in the grey old palace at Kensington the girl baby <lb/>
opened her blue eyes first on this world. The only child <lb/>
of the popular Duke of Kent and his wife, the widowed and <lb/>
charming Princess of Leiningen, great was her father's <lb/>
rejoicing at her birth. "Take care of her, for she will be <lb/>
Queen of England," he would say, with fond pride; and so <lb/>
the little Princess was baptised on the 24th of June, in the <lb/>
grand saloon of Kensington Palace, and received the name <lb/>
of Alexandrina Victoria; and it is interesting to read that she <lb/>
was successfully vaccinated the following August, and that <lb/>
she was "the first member of the Royal Family of Britain <lb/>
who received the benefit of Jenner's remarkable discovery." <lb/>
There is a happy little account of their stay at Sidmouth, <lb/>
where the little one thrived in the health-giving Devonshire <lb/>
air; but alas! the visit terminated sadly. The Duke was <lb/>
seized with a severe indisposition and chill, which resulted <lb/>
in inflammation of the chest with high fever; and before <lb/>
the babe was nine months old she was fatherless. Two <lb/>
days later the widowed Duchess, with her child and her <lb/>
brother Prince Leopold, set out for London.</p>
<p>There is a sweet word-picture here; for we are told that <lb/>
the royal infant, "being held up at the carriage window <lb/>
to bid the assembled population of Sidmouth farewell, <lb/>
sported and laughed joyously, and patted the glass with <lb/>
her pretty dimpled hands, in happy unconsciousness of her <lb/>
<pb n="17" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0028"/>
melancholy bereavement." The graphic little scene seems <lb/>
to live for us: the crowing babe, the tiny hands beating in <lb/>
infantile fashion against the shining pane, the gurgling <lb/>
laughter of the unconscious little one; while the widowed <lb/>
mother wept beside her,&mdash;how vividly one seems to see it!</p>
<p>As we follow the footsteps of the Royal child from infancy <lb/>
to childhood, and on through her early youth, the curtain <lb/>
seems to rise for us again and again; and some never-to-<reg orig="be-|forgotten">be-forgotten</reg> <lb/>
picture is placed before our eyes&mdash;distinct, lifelike, <lb/>
rich with nature's verity, and warm with colour.</p>
<p>Every writer who has striven to pourtray the leading <lb/>
incidents of Queen Victoria's life has seized eagerly on <lb/>
these little episodes, which seem to stand out with <reg orig="cameo-|like">cameo-like</reg> <lb/>
clearness, and one by one to reproduce them.</p>
<p>There was something grand and unique in the <reg orig="self-|abnegation">self-abnegation</reg> <lb/>
of the widowed Duchess of Kent when she <lb/>
determined to devote her life to the care and training of <lb/>
her fatherless child.</p>
<p>In her own noble words she says: "We stood alone&mdash; <lb/>
almost friendless and alone in this country; I could not <lb/>
even speak the language of it. I did not hesitate how to <lb/>
act; I gave up my home, my kindred, my duties &lsqb;the <lb/>
regency of Leiningen&rsqb; to devote myself to that duty which is <lb/>
to be the whole object of my life."</p>
<p>And from that time she lived at Kensington in strict <lb/>
seclusion; and from the day of her father's death until <lb/>
she ascended the throne the Princess always slept in her <lb/>
mother's room.</p>
<p>There is another infantile sketch that is very charming,&mdash; <lb/>
when we hear of the little Princess appearing in her <lb/>
phaeton, when she was fifteen months old, tied safely to the <lb/>
vehicle with a broad ribbon, and drawn by her half-sister <lb/>
Princess Feodore.</p>
<p>And we are told too that "the baby liked to be noticed, <lb/>
and answered all who spoke to her; she would say 'lady,' <lb/>
<pb n="18" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0029"/>
and 'good morning,' and when told, would hold out her <lb/>
soft dimpled hand to be kissed, with an arch expression on <lb/>
her face.&hellip; Her large blue eyes, beautiful bloom, and fair <lb/>
complexion made her a model of infantine beauty."</p>
<p>The great philanthropist William Wilberforce writes to <lb/>
Hannah More, on July 21st, 1820: "In consequence of a <lb/>
civil message from the Duchess of Kent I waited on her <lb/>
this morning. She received me with her fine animated <lb/>
child on the floor beside her with her playthings, of which I <lb/>
soon became one." The life at Kensington Palace was as <lb/>
simple as that of any English household.</p>
<p>Mr. Charles Knight, the publisher, has left a pleasing <lb/>
record of this period of the Queen's life. "I delighted," he <lb/>
narrates, "to walk in Kensington Gardens sometimes on a <lb/>
holiday afternoon with my elder girls, more frequently in <lb/>
the early morning on my way to town. In such a season, <lb/>
when the sun was hardly high enough to have dried up the <lb/>
dews of Kensington green alleys, as I passed along the <lb/>
broad central walk I saw a group on the lawn before <lb/>
the Palace, which to my mind was a vision of exquisite <reg orig="loveli-|ness">loveliness</reg>. <lb/>
The Duchess of Kent and her daughter, whose age <lb/>
then numbered nine, were breakfasting in the open air, a <lb/>
single page attending on them at a respectful distance, the <lb/>
matron looking on with eyes of love, while the fair soft face <lb/>
is bright with smiles." And farther on he exclaims with <lb/>
enthusiasm, "What a beautiful characteristic it seems to me <lb/>
of the training of this Royal girl, that she should not have <lb/>
been taught to shrink from the public eye; that she should <lb/>
enjoy the freedom and simplicity of a child's nature; that <lb/>
she should not be restrained when she starts up from the <lb/>
breakfast table and runs to gather a flower in the adjoining <lb/>
pasture; and that her merry laugh should be as fearless as <lb/>
the notes of the thrushes around! I passed on and blessed <lb/>
her; and thank God I have lived to see the golden fruits of <lb/>
such training."</p>
<pb n="19" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0030"/>
<p>Nothing could exceed the almost severe simplicity of <lb/>
that Royal household. One record by a contemporary <lb/>
informs us of the daily routine.</p>
<p>"The family party met at breakfast at eight o'clock <lb/>
in summer time, the Princess Victoria having her <lb/>
bread and milk, and fruit, put on a little table by her <lb/>
mother's side. After breakfast the Princess Feodore <lb/>
studied with her governess, Baroness Lehzen, and the <lb/>
Princess Victoria went out for an hour's walk or drive. <lb/>
From ten to twelve her mother instructed her, and then <lb/>
she would amuse herself by running through the suite of <lb/>
rooms which extended round two sides of the Palace, and <lb/>
in which were many of her toys. Her nurse was a Mrs. <lb/>
Brock, whom the Princess used to call her 'dear dear <lb/>
Boppy.' At two came a plain dinner, while the Duchess <lb/>
took her luncheon. After this, lessons again until four; <lb/>
then would come a visit or a drive, and after that the <lb/>
Princess would ride or walk in the gardens; or occasionally, <lb/>
on very fine evenings, the whole party would sit out on the <lb/>
lawn under the trees. At the time of her mother's dinner <lb/>
the Princess had her supper laid at her side; then after <lb/>
playing with her nurse she would join them at dessert, and <lb/>
at nine she would retire to her bed which was placed <lb/>
beside her mother's, day and night watched over by maternal <lb/>
love.</p>
<p>Claremont, the residence of Prince Leopold, was a second <lb/>
home to the Duchess and her children, as the Royal pen <lb/>
has noted with reference to these visits. These were the <lb/>
happiest days of the Queen's childhood. The little Princess <lb/>
adored her uncle; and in 1842, when the Queen was <reg orig="stay-|ing">staying</reg> <lb/>
at Claremont, she wrote to him in very touching words. <lb/>
"This place brings back recollections of the happiest days <lb/>
of my otherwise dull childhood; days when I experienced <lb/>
such kindness from you, dearest uncle; Victoria plays with <lb/>
my old bricks, and I see her running and jumping in the <lb/>
<pb n="20" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0031"/>
flower garden as old &lpar;though I feel still little&rpar; Victoria of <lb/>
former days used to do."</p>
<p>There is a touch of sadness here&mdash;"my otherwise dull <lb/>
childhood": no doubt the high-spirited, affectionate child <lb/>
must have yearned sorely for playmates; and that in spite of <lb/>
the care observed in the young Princess' education, and her <lb/>
mother's untiring and watchful love, the young heart must <lb/>
have had lonely hours, and she must often have regarded <lb/>
with feelings akin to envy the groups of happy children <lb/>
sporting under the trees.</p>
<p>There is a charming passage in a letter written by the <lb/>
Dowager Duchess of Coburg to the Duchess of Kent upon <lb/>
the Princess's eleventh birthday. "My blessings and good <lb/>
wishes for the day which gave you the sweet blossom of <lb/>
May! May God preserve and protect the valuable life of <lb/>
that lovely flower from all the changes that will beset her <lb/>
mind and heart. The rays of the sun are scorching at the <lb/>
height to which she may one day attain. It is only by the <lb/>
blessing of God that all the fine qualities He has put into <lb/>
that young soul can be kept pure and untarnished."</p>
<p>"Very seldom," as Dr. Macaulay informs us, "has a <lb/>
young mind and heart been more wisely and carefully <lb/>
cultivated, judging by results." He goes on to say, "What <lb/>
was the progress of the training in those early years <lb/>
we do not know, and are not likely to know except by <lb/>
the publication of any records that may have been kept <lb/>
by the governesses and teachers of the Princess, especially <lb/>
by the late Baroness Lehzen, who was with her from <reg orig="child-|hood">childhood</reg>." <lb/>
If her correspondence or diary should ever see the <lb/>
light, we shall know more of the girlhood of the Queen.</p>
<p>How interesting her statement would be, may be inferred <lb/>
from a single recollection which she gave in a letter to the <lb/>
Queen as lately as December 2nd, 1867. This was long <lb/>
after the faithful governess had retired to spend the evening <lb/>
of her life in her own country.</p>
<pb n="21" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0032"/>
<p>"I ask your Majesty's leave," writes the Baroness, "to <lb/>
cite some remarkable words of your Majesty when only <lb/>
twelve years old, while the Regency Bill was still in <reg orig="pro-|gress">progress</reg>. <lb/>
I then said to the Duchess of Kent that now for <lb/>
the first time your Majesty ought to know your place in the <lb/>
succession. Her Royal Highness agreed with me, and I <lb/>
put the genealogical table into the historical book. When <lb/>
Mr. Davys" &lpar;the Queen's instructor, afterwards Bishop of <lb/>
Peterborough&rpar; "was gone, the Princess opened, as usual, the <lb/>
book again, and seeing the additional paper, said, 'I never <lb/>
saw that before.' 'It was not thought necessary you <lb/>
should, Princess,' I answered. 'I see I am nearer the <lb/>
throne than I thought.' 'So it is, Madam,' I said. After <lb/>
some moments, the Princess resumed, 'Now, many a child <lb/>
would boast; but they don't know the difficulty. There is <lb/>
much splendour, but much responsibility.' The Princess, <lb/>
having lifted up the forefinger of her right hand, gave me <lb/>
that little hand, saying, 'I will be good, dear Lehzen; I will <lb/>
be good.' I then said, 'But your Aunt Adelaide is still <lb/>
young and may have children, and of course they will <lb/>
ascend the throne of their father William IV., and not you, <lb/>
Princess.' The Princess answered, 'And if that were so, I <lb/>
should never feel disappointed, for I know by the love my <lb/>
Aunt Adelaide bears me how fond she is of children.'"</p>
<p>One must surely allow that these were remarkable words <lb/>
to be spoken by a child of twelve; and in their calm <lb/>
seriousness they recall to our mind Mrs. Oliphant's pleasant <lb/>
description of the personal appearance of the young <lb/>
Princess. "I remember very distinctly," she says, "when <lb/>
I saw her first, being myself very young, how the calm, full <lb/>
look of her eyes impressed and affected me. Those eyes <lb/>
were very blue, serene, still, looking at you with a tranquil <lb/>
breadth of expression which somehow conveyed to your <lb/>
mind a feeling of unquestionable power and greatness, quite <lb/>
poetical in its serious simplicity. I do not suppose she was <lb/>
<pb n="22" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0033"/>
at all aware of this, for the Queen does not take credit for <lb/>
being so calmly royal; but this is how she looked to a <lb/>
fanciful girl, seeing Her Majesty for the first time."</p>
<p>G. Barnett Smith, in his interesting "Life of the Queen," <lb/>
informs us that "the Duchess of Kent early familiarised her <lb/>
illustrious daughter with the features of her own country, <lb/>
interesting her in it by personal visits to its chief cities <lb/>
and towns." In this way they visited Birmingham, <reg orig="Wor-|cester">Worcester</reg>, <lb/>
Kenilworth, and Carnarvon, and other places, and <lb/>
accepted invitations to beautiful English country seats, such <lb/>
as Eaton Hall, Alton Towers, and Chatsworth.</p>
<p>In 1833 the Duchess and her daughter took up their <lb/>
residence at their beautiful seat of Norris Castle, Isle of <lb/>
Wight. It was here the young Princess first acquired her <lb/>
love of ships and the sea. Here we have another idyllic <lb/>
sketch, delightful in its simplicity. "A tourist on one <lb/>
occasion strolled into the old churchyard at Arreton, near <lb/>
Brading, to search out the grave of Elizabeth Wallbridge, <lb/>
the heroine of Legh Richmond's popular religious story, <lb/>
'The Dairyman's Daughter.' Beside a grassy mound he <lb/>
discovered a lady and a young girl seated, the latter reading <lb/>
aloud in a full, melodious voice, the touching tale of the <lb/>
Christian maiden. The tourist turned away, and soon after <lb/>
was told by the sexton that the pilgrims to that humble <lb/>
grave were the Duchess of Kent and Princess Victoria."</p>
<p>When, in 1830, George IV. died and the Duke of <lb/>
Clarence, afterwards William IV., ascended the throne, it <lb/>
became necessary, we are told, "to provide for the <lb/>
contingency of the Princess Victoria's accession to the <lb/>
throne before attaining the age of eighteen, that being <lb/>
the period of her majority."</p>
<p>A Regency Bill was passed, and the Duchess of Kent <lb/>
was named guardian of the infant Princess and Regent of <lb/>
the Kingdom, assisted by a Council of Regency. A sum <lb/>
of &pound;10,000 a year was voted, in addition to the original <lb/>
<pb n="23" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0034"/>
annual grant of &pound;6000, for the maintenance and support <lb/>
of the heiress presumptive.</p>
<p>The young Princess made her first appearance at Court <lb/>
on Queen Adelaide's birthday, on February 24th, 1831, <lb/>
when she was thirteen. We read that "she wore a dress <lb/>
of English blonde over white satin, a pearl necklace, and <lb/>
a rich diamond agrafe fastened the Madonna braids of <lb/>
her fair hair at the back of her head."</p>
<p>There was much comment and questioning at the <lb/>
absence of the heiress presumptive on the occasion of the <lb/>
coronation of William IV. and Queen Adelaide; but <reg orig="con-|troversy">controversy</reg> <lb/>
was silenced by the statement that the Duchess of <lb/>
Kent had been anxious about her daughter's delicate health, <lb/>
and had obtained the King's sanction for her absence; <lb/>
and indeed, at the close of the Princess Victoria's fifteenth <lb/>
year, her condition gave general concern.</p>
<p>On August 30th, 1835, the Princess was confirmed in <lb/>
the Chapel Royal of St. James'. The Archbishop of <lb/>
Canterbury and the Bishop of London officiated. The <lb/>
ceremony was private; only the King and Queen, the <lb/>
Duchess of Kent, the Duchess of Saxe-Weimar, and other <lb/>
members of the Royal Family were present. But the scene <lb/>
was a touching one, for during the Archbishop's pathetic <lb/>
and tender exhortation the Royal girl was deeply affected, <lb/>
her face was bathed in tears, and unable at last to restrain <lb/>
her emotions, she laid her head on her mother's shoulder <lb/>
and sobbed aloud.</p>
<p>In painful contrast to this affecting scene Greville gives <lb/>
us a singular account of the King's birthday dinner&mdash;when <lb/>
about a hundred persons were present, and among them <lb/>
the Duchess of Kent and the Princess Victoria, when the <lb/>
King delivered a most extraordinary speech. "I trust in <lb/>
God," he is reported to have said, "that my life may be <lb/>
spared for nine months longer, after which period, in the <lb/>
event of my death, no regency would take place. I should <lb/>
<pb n="24" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0035"/>
then have the satisfaction of leaving the royal authority <lb/>
to the personal exercise of that young lady," pointing <lb/>
to the Princess, "the heiress-presumptive of the crown, <lb/>
and not in the hands of a person near me, who is <lb/>
surrounded by evil advisers, and who is herself <reg orig="incom-|petent">incompetent</reg> <lb/>
to act with propriety in the station in which she <lb/>
would be placed." The King went on to complain of <lb/>
the manner in which the Princess had been kept away <lb/>
from Court and from the Drawing-room, and in a most <lb/>
peremptory manner commanded that the Princess should <lb/>
for the future appear at Court on all occasions. Greville <lb/>
adds that this awful philippic was uttered with a loud <lb/>
voice and an excited manner, and that though the King <lb/>
concluded with an affectionate allusion to the Princess, <lb/>
it created a most painful sensation. The Queen was in <lb/>
great distress, the young Princess burst into tears; as for <lb/>
the insulted Duchess, she said not a word, but announced <lb/>
her immediate departure.</p>
<p>One can only hope that the scene is exaggerated, but it <lb/>
is well known that the King frequently lost his temper, and <lb/>
that more than once he had vented his displeasure on his <lb/>
sister-in-law. A sort of reconciliation was on this occasion <lb/>
effected, and the Duchess was induced to remain at Windsor <lb/>
until the next day.</p>
<p>May 1836 was a memorable month for Princess Victoria, <lb/>
for it was then that she first saw her future husband.</p>
<p>The "little May flower" had always been an object of <lb/>
interest to her relatives in Coburg, and the idea of her <lb/>
marriage to one of her cousins had taken deep root in the <lb/>
family. The Prince used to relate that when he was a child <lb/>
of three years old his nurse always told him that he should <lb/>
marry the Queen, and that when he first thought of marrying <lb/>
at all, he always thought of her.</p>
<p>This idea was warmly encouraged by King Leopold, and <lb/>
his friend and adviser Baron Stockmar, but the latter <lb/>
<pb n="25" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0036"/>
urged "that no claim on the Prince's behalf for the hand <lb/>
of his cousin should be preferred, unless an impression in <lb/>
his favour from personal acquaintance should first have <lb/>
been produced."</p>
<p>An invitation from the Duchess to the Duke of Coburg <lb/>
and his sons Ernest and Albert afforded an opportunity <lb/>
for the Princess to make the acquaintance of her cousins. <lb/>
"But," Stockmar wrote, "it must be made a <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italic">sine qu&acirc; non</hi></foreign> <lb/>
that the object of the visit be kept strictly secret from the <lb/>
Princess, as well as from the Prince, so as to leave them <lb/>
completely at their ease."</p>
<p>The visitors remained nearly four weeks at Kensington <lb/>
Palace, and the cousins spent delightful days together, <lb/>
playing duets on the piano, sketching, walking and riding, <lb/>
and visiting the chief attractions of the Metropolis.</p>
<p>Prince Albert writes home in his simple, affectionate way: <lb/>
"Dear Aunt is very kind to us, and does everything she can <lb/>
to please us; and our cousin also is very amiable." The <lb/>
Queen, too, gave the following description of the Prince at <lb/>
this period: "The Prince was at this time very handsome, <lb/>
but very stout, which he entirely grew out of afterwards. <lb/>
He was most amiable, natural, unaffected, and merry, full <lb/>
of interest in everything."</p>
<p>The visit of the Royal youths was a complete success, and <lb/>
the Queen unconsciously revealed her favourable opinion <lb/>
of Prince Albert in her confidential letters to her uncle, <lb/>
King Leopold. They were both now about seventeen years <lb/>
old, the Queen completing her seventeenth year during the <lb/>
visit, the Prince three months later. Sir Theodore Martin, <lb/>
in his life of the Prince Consort, tells us "that almost <lb/>
simultaneously with the Princes leaving England, King <lb/>
Leopold made the Queen aware of his wishes on the <lb/>
subject. The answer made it impossible to doubt how <lb/>
entirely those of the Princess were in accordance with <lb/>
his own. "I have only now to beg you, my dearest uncle," <lb/>
<pb n="26" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0037"/>
it concludes, "to take care of the health of one now so <lb/>
dear to me, and to take him under your special protection. <lb/>
I hope and trust that all will go on prosperously and well <lb/>
on this subject now of so much importance to me." &lpar;Letter <lb/>
of Princess Victoria to King Leopold, June 7th, 1836.&rpar;</p>
<p>On May 24th, 1837, the Princess came legally of age. <lb/>
It was a time of great rejoicing. Kind messages came from <lb/>
Windsor, and a costly piano from the King; but he was too <lb/>
ill to be present at the State Ball at St. James's, nor could <lb/>
the Queen leave him.</p>
<p>We read that the Princess Victoria opened the ball with <lb/>
young Lord FitzAlan, son of the premier Duke in England, <lb/>
the Duke of Norfolk, and that she danced with Prince <lb/>
Esterhazy&mdash;"ablaze with diamonds as usual." A few days <lb/>
later Baron Stockmar arrived on the scene, and less than <lb/>
a month after that festal birthday William IV. breathed <lb/>
his last.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that Princess Victoria made her <lb/>
last appearance in public as heiress presumptive at a <lb/>
Charity Ball given at the Opera House for the benefit of <lb/>
the Spitalfields weavers, and that her life as Princess was <lb/>
thus fitly closed by a charitable act.</p>

in this earthly existence of ours "the shadows of the <lb/>

became him like the leaving it." "Believe me, I am a <lb/>
religious man," he had said in his feeble voice to the <lb/>
Archbishop who was ministering to him; and more than <lb/>
once he had raised his dying eyes, as though in communion <lb/>
with the unseen King of kings, and murmured "Thy will <lb/>
be done."</p>
<p>Victoria Regina! God save the Queen! A Royal Idyll <lb/>
indeed!&mdash;it reads to us still like a fairy tale; we heard it <lb/>
first at our mother's knee, and hushed our young breaths <lb/>
as the thrilling story unfolded before us: the slumbering <lb/>
Palace in the dim light of that June morning, the sleeping <lb/>
Princess, the hurrying messengers: Dr. Howley, the <reg orig="Arch-|bishop">Archbishop</reg> <lb/>
of Canterbury, and the Lord Chamberlain, Lord <lb/>
Conyngham; the unavailing knocking, thumping, and <reg orig="ring-|ing">ringing</reg> <lb/>
before the drowsy porter could be aroused. We read <lb/>
how, when the attendant hesitated about disturbing the <lb/>
Princess, so sweet and sound were her slumbers, the quick <lb/>
peremptoriness of the official reply, "We have come on <lb/>
business to the Queen, and even her sleep must give way <lb/>
to that." And then follows that quaint, natural word-picture <lb/>
drawn by Miss Wynn in her "Diary of a Lady of Quality": <lb/>
"In a few minutes she &lsqb;the Princess&rsqb; came into the room <lb/>
in a loose white nightgown and shawl, her nightcap thrown <lb/>
off, and her hair falling upon her shoulders, her feet in <lb/>
slippers, tears in her eyes, but perfectly collected and <lb/>
dignified." In Mrs. Tooley's "Personal Life of Queen <lb/>
Victoria," she gives us the following interesting piece of <lb/>
information: "In 1863, when Dean Stanley was on a visit <lb/>
to the Queen at Osborne, he asked Her Majesty if she <lb/>
would give him an account of how the news of her <reg orig="acces-|sion">accession</reg> <lb/>
was conveyed to her, which she did in the following <lb/>
words: 'It was about 6 a.m. that mamma came and called <lb/>
me, and said I must go to see Lord Conyngham directly&mdash; <lb/>
alone. I got up, put on my dressing-gown, and went into <lb/>
a room, where I found Lord Conyngham, who knelt and <lb/>
<pb n="29" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0040"/>
kissed my hand, and gave me the certificate of the King's <lb/>
death. In an hour Baron Stockmar came. He had been <lb/>
sent over by King Leopold on hearing of the King's <reg orig="danger-|ous">dangerous</reg> <lb/>
illness. At 2 p.m. that same day &lpar;June 20th, 1837&rpar; <lb/>
I went to the council led by my two uncles, the King of <lb/>
Hanover and the Duke of Cambridge.'" But all accounts <lb/>
agree on one point: that the first words of the girl monarch <lb/>
on being informed of her new dignity were addressed to the <lb/>
Archbishop&mdash;"I ask your Grace to pray for me." Every <lb/>
episode of this memorable day is full of thrilling interest.</p>
<p>The young Queen's first Privy Council was held at <reg orig="Ken-|sington">Kensington</reg> <lb/>
Palace later that morning; and one can imagine <lb/>
the sensation and emotion that were excited when the <lb/>
doors were thrown open, and that girlish figure in mourning <lb/>
advanced, bowing quietly to her lords, and took her seat; <lb/>
and without embarrassment or tremor of nerves read her <lb/>
declaration in a clear silvery voice. Greville himself seemed <lb/>
to be struck with admiration at the young Queen's bearing. <lb/>
He tells us in his graphic way: "After she had read her <lb/>
speech and taken and signed the oath for the security of the <lb/>
Church of Scotland, the Privy Councillors were sworn, the <lb/>
two Royal Dukes first by themselves. And as these two old <lb/>
men, her uncles, knelt before her, swearing allegiance and <lb/>
kissing her hand, I saw her blush up to the eyes, as if she <lb/>
felt the contrast between their civil and natural relations; <lb/>
and this was the only sign of emotion which she evinced. <lb/>
Her manner to them was very graceful and engaging: she <lb/>
kissed them both, and rose from her chair and moved <lb/>
towards the Duke of Sussex, who was farthest from her and <lb/>
too infirm to reach her. She seemed rather bewildered at <lb/>
the multitude of men who were sworn, and who came one <lb/>
after another to kiss her hand; but she did not speak to <lb/>
anybody, nor did she make the slightest difference in her <lb/>
manner, or show any in her countenance, to any individual <lb/>
of rank, station, or party. I particularly watched her when <lb/>
<pb n="30" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0041"/>
Melbourne and the Ministers and the Duke of Wellington <lb/>
and Peel approached her. She went through the whole <lb/>
ceremony, occasionally looking at Melbourne for instruction <lb/>
when she had any doubt what to do, which hardly ever <lb/>
occurred, with perfect calmness and self-possession, but at <lb/>
the same time with a graceful modesty and propriety <lb/>
particularly interesting and ingratiating."</p>
<p>This was a splendid eulogium from the "acid diarist." <lb/>
But the Duke of Wellington seemed also much impressed, <lb/>
and was heard to say "that if the Queen had been his own <lb/>
daughter he could not have desired to see her perform her <lb/>
part better."</p>
<p>Immediately after the Council, we are informed the Queen <lb/>
went to her mother's room and begged with deep emotion <lb/>
to be left in absolute solitude for two hours. No one dare <lb/>
invade that sacred privacy; but we may believe that that <lb/>
fair young head was bowed in earnest prayer for strength <lb/>
and wisdom to fulfil the duty of that high station to which <lb/>
she had been called in her youth&mdash;"Victoria Regina, by the <lb/>
grace of God, Queen of the United Kingdom of Great <lb/>
Britain and Ireland."</p>
<p>There is another incident on that day which deserves <lb/>
to be mentioned. One of her first acts had been to write <lb/>
a loving letter full of tenderest sympathy to the widowed <lb/>
Queen. Some one reading the superscription, "Her Majesty <lb/>
the Queen," observed that it should be "Her Majesty the <lb/>
Queen Dowager." "I am quite aware of Her Majesty's <lb/>
altered character," was the reply, "but I will not be the first <lb/>
person to remind her of it"&mdash;an answer instinct with the <lb/>
finest delicacy.</p>
<p>On the following morning, June 21st, the Queen, <reg orig="accom-|panied">accompanied</reg> <lb/>
by her mother, drove in state to St. James's Palace. <lb/>
The guns in the Park fired a salute at ten o'clock, and <lb/>
immediately the "little Queen" stood at the window of the <lb/>
Presence Chamber in full view of the crowd, while the band <lb/>
<pb n="31" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0042"/>
of the Royal Guards struck up the National Anthem, and <lb/>
at its conclusion, while Sir William Woods, acting for the <lb/>
Garter King-at-Arms, and accompanied by the Duke of <lb/>
Norfolk as Earl Marshal of England, read aloud the <reg orig="procla-|mation">proclamation</reg>. <lb/>
The Queen looked very pale and fatigued. She <lb/>
was dressed in deep mourning, with a white tippet, white <lb/>
cuffs, and a border of white lace under a small black bonnet, <lb/>
which was placed far back on her head, exhibiting her light <lb/>
hair in front, simply parted over her forehead. She appeared <lb/>
deeply affected at the acclamations of her people, and was <lb/>
observed to shed tears. Elizabeth Barrett Browning <reg orig="com-|memorated">commemorated</reg> <lb/>
this touching incident in a lovely poem, the last <lb/>
stanza is exceptionally beautiful.</p>
<q><lg type="group">

</lg></q>
<p>When the news of his cousin's accession reached Prince <lb/>
Albert, then a student at Bonn, he wrote to Her Majesty on <lb/>
June 26th: "Now you are Queen of the mightiest land of <lb/>
Europe, in your hand lies the happiness of millions. May <lb/>
Heaven assist you and strengthen you with its strength in <lb/>
that high but difficult task." And towards the end of the <lb/>
letter: "May I pray you to think likewise sometimes of <lb/>
your cousins in Bonn."</p>
<p>On July 13th the Queen took up her residence at <lb/>
Buckingham Palace, and four days later she went in state <lb/>
to dissolve Parliament. We read that the youthful Queen <lb/>
was dressed in white satin, with the ribbon of the Garter <lb/>
crossing her shoulder, and a magnificent tiara of diamonds <lb/>
<pb n="32" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0043"/>
on her head, and a necklace and stomacher of costly <lb/>
brilliants; the Parliamentary mantle of crimson velvet and <lb/>
ermine being adjusted by the lords-in-waiting.</p>
<p>Fanny Kemble, who was present on this occasion, gives <lb/>
us an admirable description of the girl Queen. "The <lb/>
Queen is not handsome, but very pretty, and the singularity <lb/>
of her great position lent a sentimental and poetical charm <lb/>
to her youthful face and figure. The serene, serious <lb/>
sweetness of her candid brow and clear soft eyes gave <lb/>
dignity to the girlish countenance; while the want of height <lb/>
only added to the effect of extreme youth of the round but <lb/>
slender figure, and gracefully moulded hands and arms. <lb/>
The Queen's voice was exquisite, nor have I ever heard <lb/>
any spoken words more musical in their gentle distinctness <lb/>
than 'My Lords and Gentlemen,' which broke the <reg orig="breath-|less">breathless</reg> <lb/>
silence of the illustrious assembly, whose gaze was <lb/>
riveted on that fair flower of royalty. The enunciation was <lb/>
as perfect as the intonation was melodious, and I think it <lb/>
is impossible to hear a more excellent utterance than that <lb/>
of the Queen's English by the English Queen."</p>
<p>The first of Her Majesty's many deeds of mercy was <lb/>
performed soon after her accession, when she was called on <lb/>
to sign her first death warrant, presented her by the Duke <lb/>
of Wellington. It was a deserter condemned by <reg orig="court-|martial">court-martial</reg>; <lb/>
but the Queen, hearing that some witnesses had <lb/>
spoken for his character, wrote 'Pardoned' across the <lb/>
paper, and pushed it across the table, her hand trembling <lb/>
with emotion."</p>
<p>Her next act was to pay her father's debts&mdash;indeed, she <lb/>
never rested until all his liabilities had been discharged. <lb/>
His allowance had not been large, and his generosity had <lb/>
been great, and his indiscriminating charity had involved <lb/>
him in pecuniary embarrassment. "I want to pay all that <lb/>
remains of my father's debts," she said to the Prime <lb/>
Minister. "I must do it. I consider it a sacred duty." <lb/>
<pb n="33" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0044"/>
Lord Melbourne said "that the earnestness and directness <lb/>
of that good daughter's manner when speaking of her <lb/>
father brought the tears to his eyes." Lord Melbourne <lb/>
was now her chief adviser. George Villiers told Greville <lb/>
"that he was exceedingly struck with Melbourne's manner <lb/>
to the Queen, and hers to him&mdash;his so parental and <lb/>
anxious, but always so respectful and deferential; hers <lb/>
indicative of such entire confidence, such pleasure in his <lb/>
society"; and later on, "I have no doubt he is passionately <lb/>
fond of her, as he might be of his own daughter if he had <lb/>
one&mdash;and the more because he is a man with a capacity <lb/>
for loving, without having anything in the world to love. <lb/>
It is become his province to educate, instruct and form <lb/>
the most interesting mind and character in the world."</p>
<p>From the very commencement of her reign the young <lb/>
Sovereign showed that untiring industry and remarkable <lb/>
aptitude for business that was to set such a noble example <lb/>
to her subjects. As we peruse contemporary records of her <lb/>
daily life we are reminded again and again of the <reg orig="child-|princess">child-princess</reg> <lb/>
holding out her little hand with the pathetic <lb/>
utterance, "I will be good." There is a very interesting <lb/>
account, that may be quoted with profit. "She &lsqb;the Queen&rsqb; <lb/>
gets up soon after eight o'clock, breakfasts in her own <lb/>
room, and is employed the whole morning in transacting <lb/>
business; she reads all the despatches, and has every matter <lb/>
of interest and importance in every department laid before <lb/>
her. At eleven or twelve Melbourne comes to her and <lb/>
stays an hour, more or less, according to the business he <lb/>
may have to transact. At two she rides with a large suite <lb/>
&lpar;and she likes to have it numerous&rpar;; Melbourne always <lb/>
rides at her left hand, and the equerry-in-waiting on her <lb/>
right; she rides for two hours along the road, and the <lb/>
greater part of the time at a full gallop; after riding she <lb/>
amuses herself for the rest of the afternoon with music and <lb/>
singing, playing and romping with children, if there are any <lb/>
<pb n="34" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0045"/>
in the Castle &lpar;and she is so fond of them that she generally <lb/>
contrives to have some there&rpar;. The hour of dinner is <lb/>
nominally half-past seven o'clock, soon after which time <lb/>
the guests assemble, but she seldom appears before eight."</p>
<p>The account informs us that Melbourne always sat at <lb/>
her left hand at the dinner, and that the Queen would not <lb/>
allow the gentlemen to remain over their wine more than <lb/>
a quarter of an hour, but always remained standing in the <lb/>
drawing-room until they appeared. Coffee was then served, <lb/>
and after the Royal hostess had said a few words to each <lb/>
of her guests, the Duchess of Kent's whist table was <lb/>
arranged, the round table marshalled, Melbourne always <lb/>
seated at her left hand, and at half-past eleven the Queen <lb/>
retired.</p>
<p>The coronation of Her Majesty took place in Westminster <lb/>
Abbey on June 28th, 1838&mdash;a magnificent and soul-stirring <lb/>
spectacle, never to be forgotten by those who witnessed it. <lb/>
Many shed tears when the fair young girl in her royal <lb/>
robes knelt before the faldstool in silent prayer. During <lb/>
the long wearisome ceremonial, which lasted for more than <lb/>
four hours, the youthful monarch played her part with <lb/>
a noble composure and dignity. One or two incidents <lb/>
were most impressive: one when the Westminster boys <lb/>
exercised their prerogative, and rising <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italic">en masse</hi></foreign> shouted <lb/>
"Victoria, Victoria! Vivat Victoria Regina!" and again <lb/>
when the crown was placed on her head, and at the same <lb/>
moment the peers and peeresses put on their coronets, the <lb/>
trumpets sounded, the drums beat, and the Tower and <lb/>
Park guns fired their volleys. We are told that at this <lb/>
moment the Queen was visibly agitated, and that the <lb/>
Duchess of Kent was drowned in tears; "by a strong <lb/>
effort Her Majesty regained her composure," and the <lb/>
ceremonial continued. "No wonder," as an eyewitness <lb/>
informs us, "the crowned lady looked fatigued."</p>
<p>The next important event in the Queen's private life was <lb/>
<pb n="35" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0046"/>
the second visit of the cousins from Coburg. Three years <lb/>
had passed since they had been in England, and during <lb/>
most of this time Prince Albert had been carrying on his <lb/>
studies at Bonn. All that the Queen had heard of the <lb/>
Prince was most favourable, we are told; and, to use her <lb/>
own words, "she never had any idea, if she married at all, <lb/>
of any one else." Still she had desired delay&mdash;she was too <lb/>
young, the Prince was too young. Very likely the novelty <lb/>
of her dazzling position, the natural intoxication of youth, <lb/>
freedom, and power, made her reluctant to enter upon the <lb/>
serious duties and responsibilities of wedded life. She <lb/>
expressed, however, great regret afterwards that she had <lb/>
not after her accession kept up her correspondence with <lb/>
her cousin as she had done before it. "Nor can the Queen <lb/>
now," she adds, "think without indignation against herself <lb/>
of her wish to keep the Prince waiting, for probably three <lb/>
or four years, at the risk of ruining all his prospects for <lb/>
life, until she might feel inclined to marry! And the Prince <lb/>
has since told her that he came over in 1839 with the <lb/>
intention of telling her that if she could not then make <lb/>
up her mind, she must understand that he could not now <lb/>
wait for a decision, as he had done at a former period, when <lb/>
this marriage was first talked about."</p>
<p>And then, with noble frankness and perfect artlessness, <lb/>
Her Majesty continues, "The only excuse the Queen can <lb/>
make for herself is in the fact, that the sudden change <lb/>
from the secluded life at Kensington to the independence <lb/>
of her position as Queen Regnant at the age of eighteen, <lb/>
put all idea of marriage out of her mind, which she now <lb/>
most bitterly repents." All these maidenly doubts and <lb/>
scruples were to vanish, however, before the irresistible <lb/>
feeling inspired by the Prince when they met again. "The <lb/>
three years," as General Grey tells us, "had greatly improved <lb/>
both the young men." Prince Albert was eminently <lb/>
handsome. But there was also in his countenance a <lb/>
<pb n="36" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0047"/>
gentleness of expression and peculiar sweetness in his smile <lb/>
with a look of deep thought and high intelligence in his <lb/>
clear blue eyes and expansive forehead, that added a charm <lb/>
to the impression he produced in those who saw him, far <lb/>
beyond that derived from mere beauty or regularity of <lb/>
features. And the Queen herself writes to King Leopold: <lb/>
"Albert's beauty is most striking, and he is most amiable <lb/>
and unaffected&mdash;in short, very fascinating. The young <lb/>
men are both amiable and delightful companions, and I <lb/>
am glad to have them here."</p>
<p>"Happy the wooing that is not long a-doing," says the <lb/>
old adage. The Queen had given her impressions of her <lb/>
newly arrived cousins in these unaffected words probably <lb/>
on the very day of their arrival&mdash;October 10th; but on the <lb/>
15th she writes a far more conclusive letter to her old <lb/>
friend, Baron Stockmar. She had so recently expressed <lb/>
to him her resolution not to marry for some time, that <lb/>
she touches on the subject with girlish embarrassment. <lb/>
"I do feel so guilty," she writes, "I know not how to <lb/>
begin my letter, but I think the news it contains will be <lb/>
sufficient to ensure your forgiveness. Albert has completely <lb/>
won my heart, and all was settled between us this morning. <lb/>
&hellip; I feel certain he will make me very happy. I wish <lb/>
I could say I felt as certain of making him happy, but I <lb/>
shall do my best."</p>
<p>Then we have the Prince's touching account to his <lb/>
aged grandmother: "The Queen sent for me alone to her <lb/>
room a few days ago, and declared to me, in a genuine <reg orig="out-|burst">outburst</reg> <lb/>
of love and affection &lpar;'<foreign lang="ger"><hi rend="italic">Ergusse von Herzlichkeit und <lb/>
Liebe</hi></foreign>'&rpar;, that I had gained her whole heart, and would make <lb/>
her intensely happy &lpar;<foreign lang="ger"><hi rend="italic">&uuml;bergl&uuml;cklich</hi></foreign>&rpar; if I would make her the <lb/>
sacrifice of sharing her life with her&mdash;for she said she looked <lb/>
on it as a sacrifice; the only thing that troubled her was <lb/>
that she did not think she was worthy of me. The joyous <lb/>
openness of manner in which she told me this quite <lb/>
<pb n="37" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0048"/>
enchanted me, and I was quite carried away by it. She is <lb/>
really most good and amiable, and I am quite sure heaven <lb/>
has not given me into evil hands, and that we shall be <lb/>
happy together." Could anything be more idyllic in its <lb/>
simplicity and guileless reality than this betrothal of the <lb/>
"sweet Flower of May" to the princely Sir Galahad, so true <lb/>
to the motto of his house, "<foreign lang="ger"><hi rend="italic">Treu und Fest</hi></foreign>." "With the <lb/>
exception of my relations to the Queen," he writes to his <lb/>
stepmother, "my future position will have its dark side, and <lb/>
the sky will not always be blue and unclouded. But life <lb/>
has its thorns in every position, and the consciousness of <lb/>
having used one's powers and endeavours for an object <lb/>
so great as that of promoting the welfare of so many, will <lb/>
surely be sufficient to support me." But even as he writes <lb/>
these brave words there is a shadow over the bright prospect <lb/>
&mdash;the thought of leaving the beloved land of his birth, with <lb/>
all he loved so deeply.</p>
<p>But in spite of shadows and future partings, the betrothed <lb/>
couple were very happy. They had many tastes and <lb/>
sympathies in common. The Prince, we are told, had <lb/>
considerable facility as an artist, and still more as a <reg orig="com-|poser">composer</reg>; <lb/>
he also sang well and played with skill, and <lb/>
during his stay at Windsor Castle "her Majesty frequently <lb/>
accompanied him on the piano, and at a later period they <lb/>
sang together the admired productions of Rossini, Auber, <lb/>
Balfe, and Moore."</p>
<p>The Princes remained a month at Windsor, and when <lb/>
they left the Queen felt her loneliness sadly. There is a <lb/>
touching sentence in a letter of the Prince to the Duchess <lb/>
of Kent. "What you say about my poor little bride sitting <lb/>
all alone in her room, sad and silent, has touched me to <lb/>
the heart. Oh, that I might fly to her side to cheer her!" <lb/>
And the Queen herself afterwards wrote: "For 'the poor <lb/>
little bride' there was no lack of those sweet words, touched <lb/>
with the grateful humility of a manly love, to receive which <lb/>
<pb n="38" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0049"/>
was a precious foretaste to her of the happiness of the years <lb/>
to come."</p>
<p>Very lover-like were the letters that came to her. Once <lb/>
he writes, "How often are my thoughts with you! The <lb/>
hours I was privileged to pass with you in your dear little <lb/>
room are the radiant points of my life, and I cannot even <lb/>
yet clearly picture to myself that I am indeed to <hi rend="italic">be</hi> so happy <lb/>
as to be always near you, always your protector." And <lb/>
then, with the pious reverence that was already so inherent <lb/>
in his nature, he tells his <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italic">fianc&eacute;e</hi></foreign> that he was about to take <lb/>
the Sacrament, adding, with affectionate solemnity, "God <lb/>
will not take it amiss if in that serious act even at the altar <lb/>
I think of you, for I will pray to Him for you and for your <lb/>
soul's health, and He will not refuse us His blessing." <lb/>
Strangely beautiful words to be written by a young Prince <lb/>
not quite one-and-twenty!</p>
<p>The public Declaration of the intended marriage was <lb/>
postponed until it had been communicated to the Privy <lb/>
Council, and on November 20th the Queen came up to <lb/>
Buckingham Palace with her mother, and on the 23rd <lb/>
made her Declaration. It was a trying ordeal for the <lb/>
young Sovereign. "Precisely at two," the Queen writes <lb/>
in her journal, "I went in. The room was full, but I <lb/>
hardly knew who was there. Lord Melbourne I saw <lb/>
looking kindly at me, with tears in his eyes, but he <lb/>
was not near me. I then read my short declaration. <lb/>
I felt my hands shake, but I did not make one mistake. <lb/>
I felt most happy when it was over." The Queen always <lb/>
wore a bracelet with the Prince's portrait: "It seemed to <lb/>
give me courage at the council," she wrote in her na&iuml;ve <lb/>
way.</p>
<p>A Bill for the naturalization of Prince Albert was at once <lb/>
passed through both Houses of Parliament, and Her Majesty <lb/>
shortly afterwards conferred upon her future husband the <lb/>
title of Royal Highness, as well as the rank of Field Marshal <lb/>
<pb n="39" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0050"/>
in the British army. The question of the Prince's annuity <lb/>
excited a good deal of discussion in the House of Commons, <lb/>
and the sum of &pound;50,000, proposed by Lord John Russell, <lb/>
was finally reduced to &pound;30,000.</p>
<p>The marriage was fixed for February 10th, and on the 8th <lb/>
the Prince arrived, accompanied by his father and elder <lb/>
brother. There is an interesting little anecdote told of the <lb/>
Queen. It is said that the Archbishop inquired if it were her <lb/>
wish that any alteration should be made in the Liturgy with <lb/>
regard to the word "obedience." Report informs us that <lb/>
the Queen replied "that it was her wish to be married in <lb/>
all respects like any other woman, according to the revered <lb/>
usage of the Church of England; and that, though not as a <lb/>
queen, as a woman she was ready to promise all things <lb/>
contained in that portion of the Liturgy." We cannot <lb/>
vouch for the truth of this, but it is extremely probable <lb/>
that this answer was given.</p>
<p>The wedding ceremony was solemnised at St. James'. <lb/>
As the Royal bride entered her carriage, it was observed <lb/>
that she looked extremely pale and agitated; she wore <lb/>
a dress of Honiton lace over white satin, the material <lb/>
having been manufactured at Spitalfields, and the lace <lb/>
made by two hundred poor lace-workers in the village of <lb/>
Beer, near Honiton; a wreath of orange blossom and a veil <lb/>
completed her bridal attire; she had round her neck the <lb/>
collar of the Garter, but wore no other jewels. Her train <lb/>
was borne by twelve young ladies, the daughters of <reg orig="well-|known">well-known</reg> <lb/>
peers. Her responses, made in low, clear, silvery <lb/>
voice, were audible at the extreme corners of the chapel; <lb/>
and as she said "I will," we are told "that she <reg orig="accom-|panied">accompanied</reg> <lb/>
the expression with a glance at his Royal Highness <lb/>
which convinced all who beheld it that the heart was with <lb/>
her words." The Dowager Lady Lyttelton, who was an <lb/>
eyewitness of the marriage, wrote later on: "The Queen's <lb/>
look and manner were very pleasing, her eyes much swollen <lb/>
<pb n="40" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0051"/>
with tears, but great happiness in her countenance; and her <lb/>
look of confidence at the Prince when they walked away <lb/>
as man and wife was very pleasing to see. I understand <lb/>
she is in extremely high spirits since: such a new thing <lb/>
to her to dare to be unguarded in conversation with <reg orig="any-|body">anybody</reg>; <lb/>
and with her frank and fearless nature the restraints <lb/>
she had hitherto been under from one reason or another <lb/>
with everybody must have been most painful."</p>
<p>In the afternoon the bridal couple left for Windsor for <lb/>
their brief honeymoon of three days, the Queen in a white <lb/>
satin pelisse trimmed with swansdown, and a white satin <lb/>
bonnet and feather.</p>
<p>For only one day were the Queen and Prince alone <lb/>
together; and on this day she wrote to Baron Stockmar, <lb/>
"There cannot exist a dearer, purer, nobler being in the <lb/>
world than the Prince." On the 12th the Duchess of Kent, <lb/>
the Duke of Coburg, the hereditary Prince, and the whole <lb/>
court joined them, and after two more days they returned <lb/>
to London.</p>
<p>On the 28th the Duke of Coburg left England. The <lb/>
parting with his father was very painful to the Prince. <lb/>
The Queen writes of it in her Journal in her own womanly, <lb/>
pathetic fashion: "He said to me that I had never known <lb/>
a father, and could not therefore feel what he did. His <lb/>
childhood had been very happy. Ernest, he said, was <lb/>
now the only one remaining here of his earliest ties and <lb/>
recollections; but that if I continued to love him as I did <lb/>
now, I could make up for all.&hellip; Oh! how I did feel <lb/>
for my dearest, precious husband at that moment! Father, <lb/>
brother, friends, country, all has he left, and all for me. <lb/>
God grant that I may be the happy person, the most happy <lb/>
person to make this dearest, blessed being happy and <reg orig="con-|tented">contented</reg>! <lb/>
What is in my power to make him happy I <lb/>
will do."</p>
<p>Another heavy trial was in store for the Prince, when he <lb/>
<pb n="41" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0052"/>
bade his brother good-bye. "They bade farewell German <lb/>
student fashion, singing together the parting song, 'Abschied.' <lb/>
The brothers embraced affectionately, Albert being pale <lb/>
as a sheet and his eyes full of tears."</p>
<p>The Queen and Prince Albert spent their first Easter <lb/>
together at Windsor, and here they received the Sacrament <lb/>
together for the first time. About this time the Duchess <lb/>
of Kent retired to a separate establishment, and removed <lb/>
to Ingestre House, Belgrave Square; but this separation <lb/>
did not interrupt her close and loving intercourse with her <lb/>
beloved daughter.</p>
<p>And so the ideal married life began; the maiden monarch <lb/>
no longer stood alone&mdash;she had now a strong arm on which <lb/>
to lean, and a discreet and faithful adviser ever beside her. <lb/>
No one who saw them could doubt that it was a marriage <lb/>
of profound happiness and true sympathy, and the good <lb/>
Queen had her peerless knight&mdash;<foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italic">sans peur et sans reproche.</hi></foreign></p>
<p>A few touching verses written by a well-known song <lb/>
writer, Helen Marion Burnside, may fitly close this <lb/>
chapter. It is supposed to be the recollection of a Scotch <lb/>
peasant girl on the day of the Coronation.</p>

<p>"<hi rend="small-caps">In</hi> that fierce light which beats upon a throne and <lb/>
blackens every blot," the wedded bliss and <reg orig="blame-|less">blameless</reg> <lb/>
life of the royal pair seemed only to be thrown out <lb/>
in stronger relief; and in spite of the trammels of etiquette <lb/>
and the wearisome routine and burdensome duties of a <lb/>
court, they enjoyed hours of quiet unalloyed happiness.</p>
<p>From the very beginning of their married life the <lb/>
youthful pair set a noble example by their untiring devotion <lb/>
to those high duties entailed on them by their station; and <lb/>
their industry, their method of utilising their moments of <lb/>
leisure, were indeed admirable and worthy of imitation.</p>
<p>There is a very interesting sketch of the occupations of <lb/>
their daily life in the "Early Years of the Prince Consort," <lb/>
which deserves to be quoted.</p>
<p>"At this time the Prince and Queen seem to have spent <lb/>
their day much as follows: They breakfasted at nine, and <lb/>
took a walk every morning soon afterwards. Then came <lb/>
<pb n="43" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0054"/>
the usual amount of business &lpar;far less heavy than now&rpar; <lb/>
besides which they drew and etched a great deal together, <lb/>
which was a source of great amusement, having the plates <lb/>
'bit' in the house. Luncheon followed at the usual hour <lb/>
of two o'clock. Lord Melbourne, who was generally staying <lb/>
in the house, came to the Queen in the afternoon, and <lb/>
between five and six the Prince usually drove her out in a <lb/>
pony phaeton. If the Prince did not drive the Queen, he <lb/>
rode, in which case she took a drive with the Duchess of <lb/>
Kent or the ladies. The Prince also read aloud most days <lb/>
to the Queen. The dinner was at eight o'clock, and always <lb/>
with the company. In the evening the Prince frequently <lb/>
played at double chess, a game of which he was very fond <lb/>
and which he played extremely well." And three years <lb/>
later, Mr. Uwins, one of the artists employed in decorating <lb/>
a pavilion in the garden of Buckingham Palace, wrote a <lb/>
most valuable letter, an extract from which is given in the <lb/>
"Life of the Prince Consort."</p>
<p>"It has happened to me in life," he writes, "to see <lb/>
something of many royal personages; and I must say, with <lb/>
the single exception of the Duke of Kent, I have never <lb/>
met with any, either in England or on the Continent of <lb/>
Europe, who have impressed me so favourably as our <lb/>
reigning Sovereign and her young and interesting husband <lb/>
Coming to us twice a day unannounced and without <lb/>
attendants, entirely stript of all state and ceremony, courting <lb/>
conversation, and desiring reason rather than obedience, <lb/>
they have gained our admiration and love.</p>
<p>"In many things they are an example to the age. They <lb/>
have breakfasted, had morning prayers with the household <lb/>
in the private chapel, and are out some distance from the <lb/>
Palace, talking to us in the summer-house, before half-past <lb/>
nine o'clock, sometimes earlier. After the public duties of <lb/>
the day and before their dinner they come out again, <lb/>
evidently delighted to get away from the bustle of the <lb/>
<pb n="44" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0055"/>
world to enjoy each other's society in the solitude of the <lb/>
garden.</p>
<p>"Our peaceful pursuits are in accordance with the scene; <lb/>
and the opportunity of watching our proceedings seems to <lb/>
give a zest to the enjoyment of those moments snatched <lb/>
from state, parade, and ceremony. Here, too, the royal <lb/>
children are brought out by their nurses, and the whole <lb/>
arrangement seems like real domestic pleasure."</p>
<p>Could any description be more idyllic in its sweet <lb/>
simplicity? What an example to those frivolous butterflies <lb/>
of fashion always seeking after pleasure, and frittering away <lb/>
precious time and strength in their search for what they <lb/>
call happiness. Very different was our young Queen to <lb/>
these jaded worldlings; for, as Mr. Uwins says in another <lb/>
passage: "The Queen, too, is full of intelligence, her <lb/>
observations very acute, and her judgment apparently <lb/>
matured beyond her age."</p>
<p>The Queen's influence on the stage was wonderfully <lb/>
beneficial; as Mrs. Oliphant observes, "she was in the <lb/>
foreground of the national life, affecting it always for good, <lb/>
and setting an example of purity and virtue. The theatres <lb/>
to which she went, and which both she and her husband <lb/>
enjoyed, were purified by her presence; evils which had <lb/>
been the growth of years disappearing before the face of <lb/>
the young Queen."</p>
<p>On November 21st, 1840, the Queen gave birth to her <lb/>
first child, the Princess Royal, at Buckingham Palace; and <lb/>
Mrs. Lilly, the nurse, presented the little stranger, "a <lb/>
beautiful plump and healthy infant," to the Privy Councillors <lb/>
assembled in the ante-room.</p>
<p>The Prince's care and devotion were most admirable. <lb/>
While the Queen was laid up he refused to go to the play <lb/>
or to amuse himself, and always dined quietly with the <lb/>
Duchess of Kent. We are told, "that no one but himself <lb/>
ever lifted her from her bed to her sofa, and he always <lb/>
<pb n="45" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0056"/>
helped to wheel her on her bed or sofa into the next room." <lb/>
The Queen's memorandum adds in her own expressive <lb/>
words, always pathetic from their natural simplicity: "For <lb/>
this purpose he would come instantly when sent for from <lb/>
any part of the house." As years went on, and he became <lb/>
overwhelmed with work &lpar;for his attentions were the same in <lb/>
all the Queen's subsequent confinements&rpar;, this was often <lb/>
done at much inconvenience to himself; but he ever came <lb/>
with a sweet smile on his face. In short, his care of her <lb/>
was like that of a mother, nor could there have been a <lb/>
kinder, wiser, or more judicious nurse.</p>
<p>The christening of the Princess Royal took place in the <lb/>
Throne Room at Buckingham Palace, on February 10th. <lb/>
The water used for the ceremony was brought from the <lb/>
Jordan. The infant received the names of "Victoria <lb/>
Adelaide Mary Louisa." Shortly before the christening the <lb/>
Prince had an awkward accident: skating in the gardens <lb/>
of the Palace, the ice gave way, and he was suddenly <lb/>
immersed in deep water. The Queen was the only one <lb/>
who gave him efficient help, the other ladies only screaming <lb/>
for assistance. He escaped all ill effects, with the exception <lb/>
of a cold.</p>
<p>There was great rejoicing when, on the following <reg orig="No-|vember">November</reg> <lb/>
9th, 1841, the Queen gave birth to a son. An act <lb/>
of royal clemency inaugurated the auspicious event. All <lb/>
convicts who had behaved well had their punishment <reg orig="com-|muted">commuted</reg>, <lb/>
and those deserving this clemency on board the <lb/>
various hulks had their liberty granted them. There was <lb/>
great happiness in the palace. The Queen writes in her <lb/>
Journal: "To think we have two children now, and one <lb/>
who enjoys the sight already &lpar;the Christmas-tree&rpar;; it is like <lb/>
a dream." And again, in a pretty, maternal way, "Albert <lb/>
brought in dearest little Pussy &lpar;Princess Victoria&rpar; in such <lb/>
a smart white merino dress, trimmed with blue, which <lb/>
mamma had given her, and a pretty cap, and placed her <lb/>
<pb n="46" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0057"/>
on my bed, seating himself next to her, and she was very <lb/>
dear and good; and as my precious, invaluable Albert sat <lb/>
there, and our little love between us, I felt quite warm with <lb/>
happiness and love to God." And again, writing to the <lb/>
King of the Belgians: "I wonder very much whom our <lb/>
little one will be like. You will understand how fervent are <lb/>
my prayers, and I am sure everybody's must be, to see him <lb/>
resemble his father in every respect, both in mind and <lb/>
body." And in a later letter she remarks, "We all have <lb/>
our trials and vexations; but if one's home is happy, then <lb/>
the rest is nothing." What true womanly words!</p>
<p>The christening of the Prince of Wales was a most <lb/>
imposing ceremony. It took place on January 25th, 1842, <lb/>
at St. George's Chapel, Windsor, the chief sponsor being <lb/>
the King of Prussia. He received the names of Albert <lb/>
Edward.</p>
<p>After the ceremony the Queen held a Chapter of the <lb/>
Order of the Garter, when the King of Prussia, as a lineal <lb/>
descendant of George I., was elected a Knight Companion. <lb/>
In the evening there was a grand banquet in St. George's <lb/>
Hall.</p>
<p>In spite of the Queen's domestic happiness, the year <lb/>
1842 brought troubles with it. There was terrible news <lb/>
from Afghanistan, and though the British arms ultimately <lb/>
conquered, there were fearfully heavy losses, some of the <lb/>
finest of our troops being cut up. There was also war with <lb/>
China, and the condition of things at home was most <lb/>
unsatisfactory, and a growing agitation on account of the <lb/>
corn laws. There were fears of a Chartist rising, and to <lb/>
offer a stimulus to trade the Queen gave a <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italic">bal masqu&eacute;</hi></foreign> at <lb/>
Buckingham Palace, always mentioned as "The Queen's <lb/>
Plantagenet Ball." About a fortnight later a grand ball <lb/>
was given in Her Majesty's Theatre for the benefit of the <lb/>
Spitalfields weavers. The Queen was present at this.</p>
<p>Two daring attempts to assassinate the young Queen <lb/>
<pb n="47" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0058"/>
were made in this year, one by a scoundrel named John <lb/>
Francis, who fired a pistol at her as Her Majesty was driving <lb/>
down Constitution Hill, and the other by a deformed youth, <lb/>
John William Bean, who also levelled his pistol at the <lb/>
Queen, but fortunately it failed to go off. Francis was <reg orig="sen-|tenced">sentenced</reg> <lb/>
to death, but the Queen directed a reprieve of the <lb/>
sentence, although, to quote her own words, "she was fully <lb/>
conscious of the encouragement to similar attempts which <lb/>
might follow such leniency." The sentence was commuted <lb/>
to transportation for life, and he was sent to Tasmania. <lb/>
Bean was sentenced to eighteen months' imprisonment in <lb/>
Newgate. On both occasions the Queen showed the <lb/>
utmost courage. On the 13th the Queen took her first <lb/>
railway journey, travelling from Slough to Paddington in <lb/>
twenty-five minutes.</p>
<p>Her Majesty also paid her first visit to Scotland in this <lb/>
year&mdash;that land afterwards so beloved by her and the Prince <lb/>
Consort&mdash;and the enthusiasm of her Scottish subjects <reg orig="pro-|duced">produced</reg> <lb/>
a marked impression on Her Majesty's mind. The <lb/>
following year the Queen's uncle, the Duke of Sussex, died, <lb/>
and a few days later, on April 21st, another daughter was <lb/>
born to Her Majesty, who afterwards received the names of <lb/>
Alice Maud Mary.</p>
<p>The next important event was the Queen and Prince <lb/>
Consort's visit to the Ch&acirc;teau d'Eu, near Tr&eacute;port, the <lb/>
private domain of Louis Philippe. It was the first time an <lb/>
English Sovereign had visited France since the Field of <lb/>
the Cloth of Gold. This visit was a great success, and the <lb/>
Queen, writing from Eu, speaks of her pleasure "at being <lb/>
in the midst of this admirable and truly amiable family, <lb/>
where we are quite at home, and as if we are one of them."</p>
<p>The Queen and her Royal Consort paid other visits this <lb/>
year, first to Drayton Manor, as guests of Sir Robert Peel, <lb/>
and then to the Duke of Devonshire at Chatsworth. On <lb/>
January 29th, 1844, Prince Albert received the news of his <lb/>
<pb n="48" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0059"/>
father's death, but in this sad trouble the Queen's sympathy <lb/>
was a great alleviation. "I have been with the Queen," <lb/>
writes Lady Lyttelton, in a letter at this time, "a good <lb/>
deal altogether. She is very affecting in her grief, which <lb/>
is in truth all on the Prince's account, and every time she <lb/>
looks at him her eyes fill afresh. He has suffered dreadfully, <lb/>
being very fond of his father; and his separation from him, <lb/>
and the suddenness of the event, and his having expected <lb/>
to see him soon, all contributed to make it worse." Later <lb/>
on, duty demanded the Prince's presence at Coburg; and <lb/>
this separation, brief as it was&mdash;only a fortnight&mdash;was <lb/>
extremely painful to the Queen, as since their marriage <lb/>
they had not been apart for a day.</p>
<p>The great Court event of the year was the visit of <lb/>
Nicholas, the Czar of Russia, the "hard, cold, cruel, <reg orig="hand-|some">handsome</reg> <lb/>
and imposing Nicholas." There were splendid <lb/>
festivities at Windsor and Buckingham Palace.</p>
<p>On August 6th the Queen gave birth to her second son, <lb/>
Alfred Ernest Albert, afterwards Duke of Edinburgh; and <lb/>
later on, in September, she and the Princes, with the <lb/>
Princess Royal, paid another visit to Scotland, Blair Castle <lb/>
having been placed at their disposal by Lord Glenlyon, <lb/>
afterwards the Duke of Athole; and on October 8th Louis <lb/>
Philippe, King of the French, arrived at Windsor Castle.</p>
<p>Two more daughters, Helena and Louise, and a third <lb/>
son, Prince Arthur, were born to the Royal couple during <lb/>
the next few years; and still later on two other children, <lb/>
Prince Leopold and Princess Beatrice, completed the <lb/>
family.</p>
<p>The education of their children had been the Queen's <lb/>
and the Prince Consort's earliest care. Her Majesty writes <lb/>
to Lord Melbourne in 1842, "We are much occupied in <lb/>
considering the future management of our nursery <reg orig="establish-|ment">establishment</reg>, <lb/>
and naturally find considerable difficulties in it.&hellip; <lb/>
Stockmar says&mdash;and very justly&mdash;that our occupations <lb/>
<pb n="49" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0060"/>
prevent us from managing these affairs as much our own <lb/>
selves as other parents can, and therefore we must have <lb/>
some one in whom to place implicit confidence."</p>
<p>Such a person was found in Lady Lyttelton, who for <lb/>
eight years filled the office of governess to the Royal <lb/>
children, and it was a sad day for her young charges when <lb/>
she resigned her office.</p>
<p>The Queen's method of education for her children was <lb/>
excellent: they were brought up with the utmost simplicity, <lb/>
and the strictest discipline was exercised in the Royal <lb/>

<p>That charming book, "The Private Life of the Queen," <lb/>
by one of Her Majesty's servants, tells us that the Queen <lb/>
"always made time in her busy life to bathe with her own <lb/>
hands the last new baby."</p>
<p>The children were never brought into contact with Court <lb/>
life. "Many of the Queen's ladies scarcely knew the Royal <lb/>
children, save by sight, and by catching brief glimpses of <lb/>
them as they walked in the gardens with their parents, or <lb/>
sometimes came to dessert, after dinner. The most <reg orig="care-|fully">carefully</reg> <lb/>
selected governesses and professors taught the children <lb/>
English, French, German, and the arts."</p>
<p>And again: "The religious training of the Royal children <lb/>
was entirely mapped out by the Queen, who herself drew up <lb/>
a memorandum, which if it were given to the world in full, <lb/>
would prove of inestimable benefit to all parents, so kindly, <lb/>
so truly sympathetic, so earnest and womanly is it. <reg orig="Touch-|ing">Touching</reg> <lb/>
the Princess Royal in particular, she says, 'I am quite <lb/>
clear that she should be taught to have great reverence for <lb/>
God and for religion, and that she should have the feeling <lb/>
of devotion and love which our heavenly Father encourages <lb/>
His earthly children to have for Him, and not one of <lb/>
fear and trembling.'</p>
<p>"The note touching the religious training of the Prince <lb/>
of Wales was even more decided: 'The law prescribes the <lb/>
<pb n="50" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0061"/>
belief of the Church of England shall be the faith of the <lb/>
members of the Royal Family, and in this faith the Prince <lb/>
of Wales must unquestioningly be trained."</p>
<p>In all these matters the Prince Consort was her truest <lb/>
adviser and counsellor; and as years passed and the weight <lb/>
of government and public cares pressed more heavily on the <lb/>
Queen, so did she lean more on that strong arm and bright <lb/>
intellect, and the patient, cheerful, considerate spirit, "which <lb/>
toil and trial and disappointment seemed only to ripen into <lb/>
fuller beauty." In reading the records of the Royal lives <lb/>
one is struck by the Prince Consort's application to work <lb/>
and his unflagging and incessant industry. As Sir Theodore <lb/>
Martin tells us, in his exhaustive "Life of the Prince," <lb/>
"Every enterprise of national importance claimed his <lb/>
attention; and in all things that concerned the welfare of <lb/>
the State, at home or abroad, his accurate and varied <lb/>
knowledge, and great political sagacity, made him looked <lb/>
to as an authority by all our leading statesmen." And in <lb/>
another passage full of interest, he tells us his methods of <lb/>
work. "Like most men who have done great things in the <lb/>
world, the Prince got to his work early, and had made good <lb/>
progress with it before other people were stirring. Summer <lb/>
or winter he rose as a rule at seven, dressed and went to <lb/>
his sitting-room, where in winter a fire was burning, and <lb/>
a green German lamp ready lit. He read and answered <lb/>
letters, never allowing his vast correspondence to fall into <lb/>
arrears; or prepared for Her Majesty's consideration drafts <lb/>
of answers to her Ministers on any matters of importance. <lb/>
&hellip; He kept up this habit to the close of his life, and <lb/>
his last memorandum of this description he brought to <lb/>
the Queen on December 1st, 1861, at 8 a.m., having risen <lb/>
to write it, ill and suffering as he was, saying as he gave it, <lb/>
"Ich bin so schwach, ich habe kaum die Feder halten <lb/>
k&ouml;nnen" &lpar;I am so weak, I have scarcely been able to <lb/>
hold the pen&rpar;.</p>
<pb n="51" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0062"/>
<p>During all these years of stirring life there were many <lb/>
events of the deepest interest to the Queen and her Royal <lb/>
Consort. In 1845 she accompanied him to Germany.</p>
<p>The previous fortnight had been spent at their new island <lb/>
home, Osborne, which had been purchased in the preceding <lb/>
year&mdash;a marine residence comprising grounds of upwards <lb/>
of eight hundred acres, and well stocked with noble timber. <lb/>
A new mansion was subsequently built. "The house," the <lb/>
Queen writes, "was planned by the Prince, and his wishes <lb/>
admirably carried out by the late Mr. Thomas Cubitt.&hellip; <lb/>
In laying out the grounds and his farming operations," Her <lb/>
Majesty adds, "the Prince was ably seconded by Mr. <lb/>
Toward, our land steward for twenty-six years." In truth, <lb/>
the Prince might have said, as Scott did of Abbotsford: <lb/>
"My heart clings to the place I have erected. There is <lb/>
scarce a tree in it that does not owe its existence to me." <lb/>
The property now extends to 2300 acres.</p>
<p>We read pleasant accounts of the house-warming when <lb/>
the Queen and her household first took up their residence <lb/>
there, when the Queen's and Prince's healths were drank; <lb/>
and at the Prince's suggestion an appropriate Psalm was <lb/>
sung, translated from Luther's "God bless our going out, <lb/>
nor less our coming in, and make them sure."</p>
<p>The visit to Coburg with her beloved husband gave the <lb/>
Queen intense pleasure. Rosenau was the place where <lb/>
he had been born and "spent the happiest years of his <lb/>
boyhood."</p>
<p>"How happy, how joyful," she writes in her journal, "we <lb/>
were, on awaking, to feel ourselves here, at the dear Rosenau, <lb/>
my Albert's birthplace, the place he most loves! He is so, <lb/>
so happy to be here with me. It is like a beautiful dream."</p>
<p>September 1848 was memorable to the Royal couple, for <lb/>
it was their first visit to their future Highland home. We <lb/>
are told in the "Life of the Prince Consort" that Sir James <lb/>
Clark's attention had been called to the fine air and other <lb/>
<pb n="52" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0063"/>
attractions of this part of Deeside as a summer and autumn <lb/>
residence. Having satisfied himself on these points, he <lb/>
had urged the Queen and Prince to acquire the lease of the <lb/>
Balmoral estates from the Earl of Aberdeen. Writing to <lb/>
the Dowager Duchess of Coburg, the Prince says of this <lb/>
visit:&mdash;</p>
<p>"We have withdrawn for a short time into a complete <lb/>
mountain solitude, where one rarely sees a human face, <lb/>
where the snow already covers the mountain tops, and the <lb/>
wild deer come creeping stealthily round the house. Scenes <lb/>
which, in Her Majesty's own words, seem to breathe <lb/>
freedom and peace, and to make one forget the world and <lb/>
its sad turmoil."</p>
<p>The following year, 1849, was still more memorable, for <lb/>
the Great Exhibition was first projected by the Prince <lb/>
Consort. The germ of this and all Industrial Exhibitions of <lb/>
our own age was contained in the celebrated Frankfort Fairs <lb/>
of the sixteenth century. The Prince propounded his views <lb/>
to four most active members of the Society of Arts; and after <lb/>
taking counsel with the Government, a fitting area was found <lb/>
in Hyde Park. In this year, too, the Queen and the Prince <lb/>
paid their first visit to Ireland, and received a most <reg orig="enthu-|siastic">enthusiastic</reg> <lb/>
welcome from the warm-hearted people; "the effect <lb/>
produced by the visit was most salutary," wrote Sir James <lb/>
Clark, who formed one of the Royal suite. The year closed <lb/>
sadly, however, with the death of the Queen Dowager, the <lb/>
good, amiable Queen Adelaide, at Bentley Priory.</p>
<p>The opening of the Great Exhibition in Hyde Park was <lb/>
an eventful day in the Queen's life. She wrote a graphic <lb/>
account of the ceremony in her diary. Her thankfulness <lb/>
and joy are, as usual, touchingly expressed. "God bless my <lb/>
dearest Albert! God bless my dearest country, which has <lb/>
shown itself so great to-day! One felt so grateful to the <lb/>
great God who seems to pervade all and bless all! The <lb/>
only event it in the slightest degree reminded me of was the <lb/>
<pb n="53" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0064"/>
coronation, but this day's festival was a thousand times <lb/>
superior. In fact, it is unique, and can bear no comparison, <lb/>
from its peculiarity, beauty, and combination of such <lb/>
different and striking objects." And in another passage: <lb/>
"Albert is immortalised;" here is the wifely key-note of <lb/>
the whole; and in a letter to Lady Lyttelton she writes, <lb/>
"&hellip; that great and glorious 1st of May. The proudest <lb/>
and happiest day of&mdash;as you truly call it&mdash;my happy life.&hellip; <lb/>
To see this great conception of my beloved husband's mind, <lb/>
which is always labouring for the good of others, to see this <lb/>
great thought and work crowned with triumphant success, <lb/>
in spite of difficulties and opposition of every imaginable <lb/>
kind, and of every effort to which jealousy and calumny <lb/>
could resort to cause its failure, has been an immense <lb/>
happiness to us both."</p>
<p>Thackeray's "May-Day Ode" expressed the universal <lb/>
feeling:&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"But yesterday a naked sod:</l>
<l>The dandies sneered from Rotten Row,</l>
<l>And cantered o'er it to and fro;</l>
<l>And see, 'tis done!</l>
<l>As though 'twere by a wizard's rod,</l>
<l>A blazing arch of lucid glass</l>
<l>Leaps like a fountain from the grass</l>
<l>To meet the sun."</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>We are told that this beautiful poem, cut from the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <lb/>
was preserved by the Prince, as it well deserved to be, <lb/>
among his private records of the Exhibition.</p>
<p>The following year the Duke of Wellington died, much <lb/>
mourned by Her Majesty; for in some measure "he had <lb/>
held towards her the triple capacity of father, hero, and <lb/>
friend."</p>
<p>Clouds were gathering on the horizon, and troublous <lb/>
times coming for England and England's Queen. On <lb/>
February 28th, 1854, Her Majesty signed a formal <reg orig="declara-|tion">declaration</reg> <lb/>
of war with Russia; and for the next two years we are <lb/>
<pb n="54" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0065"/>
told that her life was spent in consuming anxiety. Alma, <lb/>
Inkermann, Balaclava, and the charge of the Light Brigade <lb/>
&mdash;the blood of heroes shed freely&mdash;and the cry of widows <lb/>
and orphans ascending to heaven.</p>
<p>The Queen suffered so keenly for her soldiers, that one <lb/>
of the Royal children said to Lord Cardigan, when he came <lb/>
to Windsor, "You must hurry back to Sebastopol and take <lb/>
it, else it will kill mamma." It was after the Crimean War, <lb/>
with its dearly bought victories, that Her Majesty first <lb/>
distributed that much coveted distinction, the Victoria <lb/>
Cross or Cross of Valour; and we are also told that it <lb/>
was owing to the Queen's efforts that the beautiful military <lb/>
hospital of Netley was built. It was at this time the Queen <lb/>
conferred on her husband the title of Prince Consort.</p>
<p>In 1857 her Majesty's last child, the Princess Beatrice, <lb/>
was born; and soon after followed the betrothal of the <lb/>
Princess Royal, then only fifteen years old, to Prince <lb/>
Frederick William of Prussia, heir to the throne. The <lb/>
two years that intervened between the engagement and <lb/>
marriage were saddened by the awful tidings of the Indian <lb/>
Mutiny. "We are tortured by the events in India," wrote <lb/>
the Prince to his faithful Stockmar, "which are truly <lb/>
frightful!" And again the Queen's womanly sympathies <lb/>
were strongly excited by the terrible details of Cawnpore.</p>
<p>On the Princess Royal's wedding day the Queen wrote <lb/>
in her Journal: "The second most eventful day of my life <lb/>
as regards feelings. I felt as though I was being married <lb/>
over again myself, only much more nervous, for I had not <lb/>
the blessed feeling of giving myself for life to him whom <lb/>
I loved and worshipped then and ever." The parting <lb/>
from their beloved child was keenly felt by the Queen and <lb/>
Prince Consort. The young Princess soon won golden <lb/>
opinions in her new home; and her father's remark, "that <lb/>
the Princess Royal had a man's head and a child's heart," <lb/>
was soon confirmed by the reports from Berlin. The <lb/>
<pb n="55" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0066"/>
Queen's first grandchild, a boy, was born when his mother <lb/>
was only eighteen, and his grandmother thirty-nine. And <lb/>
the next domestic event of deep interest was the betrothal <lb/>
of Princess Alice to Prince Louis of Hesse, on November <lb/>
30th, 1860.</p>
<p>1861 was a disastrous year to our beloved monarch&mdash;a <lb/>
year of sorrow and bereavement.</p>
<p>On March 16th the Queen lost her mother, the Duchess <lb/>
of Kent.</p>
<p>"She is gone," she writes, to her uncle, King Leopold, <lb/>
during those first hours of bereavement; "that precious, <lb/>
dearly beloved, tender mother, whom I never parted with <lb/>
but for a few months, without whom I cannot imagine life, <lb/>
has been taken from us.&hellip; I held her dear hand in <lb/>
mine to the last, which I am truly thankful for. But the <lb/>
watching that precious life going out was fearful! Alas! <lb/>
she never knew me; but she was spared the pang of <lb/>
parting.&hellip; I feel so truly <foreign lang="ger"><hi rend="italic">verwaist</hi></foreign> &lpar;orphaned&rpar;." Throughout <lb/>
these sad days of bereavement the Prince was her truest <lb/>
comforter. "He was so tender and kind," she writes <lb/>
in her diary, "so pained to have to ask me distressing <lb/>
questions, but spared me so much. Everything done so <lb/>
quietly and feelingly." And indeed that watchful care and <lb/>
sympathy never failed her while his life lasted. In August <lb/>
Her Majesty and the Prince paid another visit to Ireland, <lb/>
accompanied by Prince Arthur and the Princesses Alice and <lb/>
Helena. They then proceeded to their beloved Highland <lb/>
home, where they spent a few weeks of retirement; the last <lb/>
they were to spend there together, for the shadow of death <lb/>
was soon to draw over that happy married life.</p>
<p>For the last ten years the health of the Prince Consort <lb/>
had been unsatisfactory. The severe mental strain entailed <lb/>
by incessant work, and the sense of his responsibility as <lb/>
private adviser to Her Majesty, had weakened his constitution, <lb/>
and with all the goodwill of those who served and helped <lb/>
<pb n="56" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0067"/>
him so faithfully, they could not prevent "a pressure which <lb/>
constantly compelled him to do in one day what would <lb/>
have been more than ample work for two." Well may <lb/>
he speak, in one of his letters to the Crown Princess, of <lb/>
"the treadmill of never-ending business."</p>
<p>"It was evident," as Sir Theodore Martin tells us, "that <lb/>
the Prince Consort was in a state of health when any little <lb/>
casualty, whether of exposure to the weather or to any <lb/>
noxious agent of any kind, could scarcely fail to affect him <lb/>
seriously." The typhoid fever, under which he eventually <lb/>
sank, was undoubtedly germinated about November 22nd, <lb/>
when he went to Sandhurst to inspect the building for the <lb/>
new Staff College and Royal Military Academy. It was <lb/>
a day of incessant rain, "<hi rend="italic">entsetzlicher Regen</hi>" &lpar;"terrific <lb/>
rain"&rpar; as he calls it; and there is no doubt the fatigue and <lb/>
exposure produced injurious results. We are told in the <lb/>
"Prince Consort's Life," that he had no strong yearning <lb/>
for life, "and that he contemplated the prospect of death <lb/>
with an equanimity by no means common in men of his <lb/>
years." Not long before his fatal illness, in speaking to <lb/>
the Queen, he said: "I do not cling to life; you do, but <lb/>
I set no store by it. If I knew that those I love were <lb/>
well cared for, I should be quite ready to die to-morrow." <lb/>
And in the same conversation he adds: "I am sure if I <lb/>
had a severe illness I should give up at once. I should <lb/>
not struggle for life; I have no tenacity of life." Sadly <lb/>
prophetical words these proved; but they were said without <lb/>
sadness&mdash;his ripe and chastened spirit was ready to follow <lb/>
the Divine will, either for life or death. It is distressing <lb/>
to follow the details of that sad illness, gleaned from the <lb/>
pages of the Queen's Diary,&mdash;to read of discomfort and <lb/>
restlessness, broken snatches of sleep, prostration and <lb/>
suffering, unutterable feelings of wretchedness and <reg orig="depres-|sion">depression</reg>. <lb/>
Such sad entries as this occur on December 5th. <lb/>
"He did not smile, or take much notice of me, but <lb/>
<pb n="57" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0068"/>
complained of his wretched condition, and asked what it <lb/>
could be and how long this state of things might last.&hellip; <lb/>
His manner all along was so unlike himself, and he had <lb/>
sometimes such a strange, wild look." By December 6th <lb/>
the physicians, Dr. Jenner and Sir James Clark, had no <lb/>
doubt of the nature of the illness, that it was gastric or low <lb/>
fever, and they broke the intelligence to the Queen. <lb/>
"I seem to live in a dreadful dream," is the entry of <lb/>
December 7th. "Later in the day my angel lay in bed, <lb/>
and I sat by him watching. The tears fell fast as I thought <lb/>
of the days of anxiety, even if not of alarm, which were <lb/>
in store for us; of the utter shipwreck of new plans, and <lb/>
of the dreadful loss this long illness would be publicly as <lb/>
well as privately; and then, when I had seen Sir James <lb/>
and Dr. Jenner, I talked over what could have caused <lb/>
this illness. Great worry and far too hard work for long. <lb/>
That must be stopped." The Prince's medical advisers <lb/>
had strongly urged their patient to remain in bed; he had <lb/>
resisted their entreaties for some time; when at last their <lb/>
counsel prevailed it was too late. The shadows were <lb/>
deepening, and already the veiled figure of the Dark Angel <lb/>
was on the threshold! By December 12th it was evident <lb/>
the fever and the shortness of breath increased, there was <lb/>
also a probability of congestion of the lungs; and by the <lb/>
13th Dr. Jenner was obliged to inform the Queen that <lb/>
the illness was extremely serious. All through this trying <lb/>
time of anxiety and suffering the Princess Alice was the <lb/>
greatest comfort to her parents.</p>
<p>The sufferer had been removed into the Blue Room, <lb/>
a fine large cheerful room; strange to say it was the very <lb/>
apartment where William IV. and George IV. had died. <lb/>
A letter written by one of the household gives a touching <lb/>
account of that Sunday:&mdash;</p>
<p>"The last Sunday the Prince spent on earth was a very <lb/>
blessed one for the Princess to look back upon. He was <lb/>
<pb n="58" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0069"/>
very ill and weak, and she spent the afternoon alone with <lb/>
him while the others were at church. He begged to have his <lb/>
sofa drawn to the window, that he might see the sky and <lb/>
the clouds sailing past. He then asked her to play to him, <lb/>
and she went through several of his favourite hymns and <lb/>
chorales &lpar;'Ein feste Burg ist unserGott' amongst them&rpar;. <lb/>
After she had played some time she looked back and saw <lb/>
him lying back, his hands folded as if in prayer, and his <lb/>
eyes shut. He lay so long without moving that she thought <lb/>
he had fallen asleep. Presently he looked up and smiled. <lb/>
'Were you asleep, dear Papa?' 'Oh no,' he answered; <lb/>
'only I have such sweet thoughts.'"</p>
<p>During his illness his hands were often folded in prayer; <lb/>
and when he could not speak, his serene face showed that <lb/>
the "happy thoughts" were with him still. "&hellip; Of the <lb/>
devotion and strength of mind shown by the Princess Alice <lb/>
all through these trying scenes it is impossible to speak too <lb/>
highly."</p>
<p>Dr. Watson and Sir Henry Holland had been called in, <lb/>
but though there had been a decided rally, they were all <lb/>
very anxious; and on Friday the 13th, the Prince's condition <lb/>
was regarded as extremely critical.</p>
<p>The Queen had been constantly with him, and he had <lb/>
shown "obvious reluctance to being left by Her Majesty <lb/>
even for the short intervals when her attendance was <lb/>
required elsewhere." Even on the fatal Saturday, the 14th, <lb/>
Sir Theodore Martin tells us, Mr. Brown, of Windsor, who <lb/>
was thoroughly acquainted with the Prince's constitution, <lb/>
informed the Queen "that he thought the Prince was <lb/>
better, and there was ground to hope that the crisis was <lb/>
over."</p>
<p>"I went over at seven," Her Majesty writes, "as I <lb/>
usually did. It was a bright morning, the sun just rising <lb/>
and shining brightly. The room had the sad look of <lb/>
night watching, the candles burnt down to their sockets <lb/>
<pb n="59" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0070"/>
the doctors looking anxious. I went in, and never can I <lb/>
forget how beautiful my darling looked, lying there with <lb/>
his face lit up by the rising sun, his eyes unusually bright, <lb/>
gazing as it were on unseen objects and not taking notice <lb/>
of me.</p>
<p>"The hours wore on in agonising alternations of hope <lb/>
and fears."</p>
<p>The Prince of Wales, who had been summoned from <lb/>
Maddingly, had arrived at three in the morning. At twelve <lb/>
the Queen went out on the terrace with Princess Alice for <lb/>
a breath of air; but a military band was playing and she <lb/>
burst into tears and hurried back. The doctors had not <lb/>
yet given up hope; the breathing was the alarming thing, <lb/>
it was so rapid; and also, in the Queen's words, "there was <lb/>
a dusky hue about his face and hands which I knew <lb/>
was not good."</p>
<p>We must quote from Sir Theodore Martin's sad account. <lb/>
"The Queen's distress was terrible; she only left the <lb/>
Prince's room for the one adjoining. Still the doctors <lb/>
continued to comfort her with hope, but they could not <lb/>
blind her to the signs that this precious life, this most <lb/>
precious of lives to her, was ebbing away."</p>
<p>"About half-past five," Her Majesty writes, "I went in <lb/>
and sat beside his bed, which had been wheeled into the <lb/>
middle of the room. 'Gutes Frauchen,' he said, and kissed <lb/>
me."</p>
<p>Later on, when his children and attendants had each <lb/>
kissed his hand, the Queen again bent over him and <lb/>
whispered "Es ist kleines Frauchen," &lpar;'Tis your own little <lb/>
wife&rpar;, and he bowed his head and kissed her.</p>
<p>As the evening advanced a rapid change came on. The <lb/>
Queen, who had retired to give vent to her grief, was <lb/>
summoned from the adjoining room; she took his hand <lb/>
"which was already cold, though the breathing was gentle," <lb/>
and knelt down beside him. As the Castle clock chimed <lb/>
<pb n="60" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0071"/>
the third quarter after ten, two or three long breaths were <lb/>
drawn, and the weary warrior, the worn out worker, was <lb/>
at rest. One of the noblest souls that had ever blessed this <lb/>
world had entered into rest.</p>
<p>Well and fitly has our glorious Poet Laureate written&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"Dear to thy land and ours, a Prince indeed,</l>
<l>Beyond all titles, and a household name</l>
<l>Hereafter, thro' all times, Albert the Good."</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>"Their works do follow them." Truly we may say of our <lb/>
Great Prince that his beloved name is graven indelibly on <lb/>
the hearts and memories of all English men and English <lb/>
women.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> writer of this sketch well remembers that <reg orig="melan-|choly">melancholy</reg> <lb/>
Sunday, December 15th, when the omission <lb/>
of the Prince Consort's name from the Litany informed the <lb/>
congregation that their revered monarch was a widow. A <lb/>
thrill ran through the church at that solemn and ominous <lb/>
pause; and there were aching hearts and wet eyes as many <lb/>
a silent prayer was breathed for that beloved lady. "God <lb/>
bless and comfort her broken heart." "God help our <lb/>
Queen." "That it may please Thee to defend, and provide <lb/>
for, the fatherless children and widows, and all that are <lb/>
desolate and oppressed." How earnest and united that <lb/>
heartfelt response, "We beseech Thee to hear us, good <lb/>
Lord"!</p>
<p>The great bell of St. Paul's tolled at midnight, and early <lb/>
the next morning the mournful news was flashed by telegraph <lb/>
<pb n="62" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0073"/>
to all parts of the empire. The young Prince Leopold <lb/>
was at Cannes, and in great grief at the death of his <lb/>
governor, General Bowater, who had just died; and the <lb/>
child's anguish at hearing of this fresh sorrow was <reg orig="heart-|rending">heart-rending</reg>. <lb/>
"My mother will bring him back again," he kept <lb/>
sobbing out. "Oh! I want my mother."</p>
<p>Barnett Smith, in his interesting "Life of the Queen," <lb/>
tells us that there was great anxiety at Windsor for the <lb/>
Queen and Princess Alice.</p>
<p>The beloved friend and attendant of the Duchess of Kent, <lb/>
Lady Augusta Bruce &lpar;afterwards wife of Dean Stanley&rpar;, was <lb/>
summoned to Windsor; and that other dear friend of the <lb/>
Queen, the Duchess of Sutherland, herself lately widowed, <lb/>
had also been asked to stay with her Royal mistress. We <lb/>
will quote the entire passage: "For three days they &lpar;the <lb/>
Queen and Princess Alice&rpar; suffered terribly, and Her <lb/>
Majesty's weakness was so great that her pulse could hardly <lb/>
be felt. The Princess afterwards said that she wondered <lb/>
how her mother and herself had lived through these first <lb/>
bitter days. The Queen "spoke about God's knowing <lb/>
best, but showed herself broken-hearted." At length the <lb/>
country was relieved, on learning that exhausted nature had <lb/>
somewhat recovered itself, and that the Queen had slept. <lb/>
Her Majesty was again and again urged to leave Windsor <lb/>
before the funeral; but she wept bitterly, and said her <lb/>
subjects were never advised to leave their homes or the <lb/>
remains of those lost to them. It was only when the safety <lb/>
of her children was pleaded as a means of giving them <lb/>
immunity from the fever, that she was prevailed upon to <lb/>
leave Windsor and repair to Osborne. Before her departure <lb/>
the Queen visited Frogmore to choose a site for a <reg orig="mauso-|leum">mausoleum</reg>, <lb/>
where her beloved husband and she herself were yet <lb/>
to lie side by side."</p>
<p>The funeral took place at Windsor on December 23rd. <lb/>
The chief mourner was the Prince of Wales, who was <lb/>

accompanied by Prince Arthur, a boy of eleven; the Duke <lb/>
of Saxe Coburg, the Prince Consort's only brother, was also <lb/>
there. The scene at the grave was very touching; the <lb/>
young princes sobbed bitterly, "and heartfelt sorrow was on <lb/>
the face of every mourner." Throughout the country there <lb/>
was long and genuine mourning for the "blameless Prince."</p>
<p>"There is no one to call me Victoria now," the Queen is <lb/>
said to have exclaimed, the morning of her bereavement,&mdash; <lb/>
and perhaps no words could have expressed more strongly <lb/>
the sense of her great loneliness.</p>
<p>There is a poem written by a contemporary poet, <lb/>
Christopher Riethm&uuml;ller, which embodies this idea. Lady <lb/>
Waterford, in one of her graphic letters, mentions the poem: <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"Toll, Great Bell of St. Paul!</l>
<l rend="indent">Toll through the midnight air!</l>
<l>Bid all the people fall</l>
<l rend="indent">Upon their knees in prayer!</l>
<l>For the dear Lady left</l>
<l rend="indent">Upon her glittering throne,</l>
<l>More utterly bereft,</l>
<l rend="indent">More hopelessly alone</l>
<l>Than the poor peasant's wife;</l>
<l rend="indent">Because from her is riven</l>
<l>The only human life</l>
<l rend="indent">That to her state was given</l>
<l>To help, control, and guide;</l>
<l rend="indent">The only voice below</l>
<l>Which had the right to chide,</l>
<l rend="indent">Or sweetest praise bestow!</l>
<l>Millions will love her still&mdash;</l>
<l rend="indent">Ay, fondlier than before!</l>
<l>But the one equal will</l>
<l rend="indent">Is gone for evermore."</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>The Marchioness of Waterford in another letter, speaking <lb/>
of her own loss, the death of her sister, Lady Canning, <lb/>
mentions the Queen's grief. "The Queen's most grievous <lb/>
calamity I can well feel for. I hear, from one who saw her, <lb/>
'that it was heartrending to see her in her calm, eloquent <lb/>
<pb n="64" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0075"/>
sorrow.' This beautiful resignation must endear her more <lb/>
than ever to her people."</p>
<p>"For some years after the death of the Prince Consort," <lb/>
as Dr. Macaulay tells us, "the Queen appeared very little <lb/>
in public. Overwhelmed with grief, she lived almost wholly <lb/>
in retirement; but we are assured that, even at that time, <lb/>
no official duty was neglected." Neither did she forget the <lb/>
troubles of others; for when that terrible Hartley colliery <lb/>
disaster occurred, by which 204 miners lost their lives, Her <lb/>
Majesty sent a message to the effect "that her tenderest <lb/>
sympathy is with the poor widows and mothers, and that <lb/>
her own misery only makes her feel the more for them."</p>
<p>Regrets, almost amounting to complaints, were heard <lb/>
from time to time, which led to a touching article in the <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Times</hi>. Some people affirmed that it was from the Queen's <lb/>
own pen; but, anyway, it embodied her feelings most truly.</p>
<p>After touching on these complaints, it goes on: "The <lb/>
Queen heartily appreciates the desire of her subjects to see <lb/>
her, and whatever she can do to gratify them in this loyal, <lb/>
affectionate wish, she will do. Whenever any real object is <lb/>
to be obtained by her appearing on public occasions, any <lb/>
national interest to be promoted, or anything to be <reg orig="en-|couraged">encouraged</reg> <lb/>
which is for the good of her people, Her Majesty <lb/>
will not shrink, as she has not shrunk, from any personal <lb/>
sacrifice or exertion, however painful.</p>
<p>"But there are other and higher duties than those of <lb/>
mere representation which are now thrown on the Queen <lb/>
alone and unassisted, duties which she cannot neglect <reg orig="with-|out">without</reg> <lb/>
injury to the public service, which weigh unceasingly <lb/>
upon her, overwhelming her with work and anxiety.</p>
<p>"The Queen has laboured conscientiously to discharge <lb/>
these duties, till her health and strength, already shaken by <lb/>
the utter and ever-abiding desolation which has taken the <lb/>
place of her happiness, have been seriously impaired. To <lb/>
call upon her to undergo, in addition, the fatigue of those <lb/>
<pb n="65" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0076"/>
mere State ceremonies which can be equally well performed <lb/>
by other English members of her family, is to ask her to <lb/>
run the risk of entirely disabling herself for the discharge <lb/>
of those other duties which cannot be neglected without <lb/>
serious injury to the public interests.&hellip; More the Queen <lb/>
cannot do, and more the kindness and good feeling of her <lb/>
people will surely not exact from her."</p>
<p>This dignified remonstrance was afterwards endorsed by <lb/>
a speech of the Duke of Argyle. His Grace remarks: <lb/>
"I think it a circumstance worthy of observation, and <lb/>
which ought to be known to the people of this country, <lb/>
that during all the years of the Queen's affliction, during <lb/>
which she has lived necessarily in comparative retirement, <lb/>
she has omitted no part of that public duty which concerns <lb/>
her as Sovereign of this country; that on no occasion <lb/>
during her grief has she neglected work, in those public <lb/>
duties that belong to her exalted position."</p>
<p>And in 1866, at a great meeting held at St. James's Hall, <lb/>
we are told that Mr. Bright asked leave to refer in a few <lb/>
words to the insinuation contained in the speech of the <lb/>
Member for the Tower Hamlets as to the indifference of <lb/>
the Queen to public affairs.</p>
<p>"I am not accustomed," he said, "to stand up in defence <lb/>
of those who are possessors of crowns; but I could not sit <lb/>
and hear that observation without a sensation of wonder <lb/>
and of pain. I think there has been, by many persons, <lb/>
a great injustice done to the Queen in reference to her <lb/>
desolate and widowed position; and I venture to say this, <lb/>
that a woman, be she Queen of a great realm, or the <lb/>
wife of one of your labouring men, who can keep alive in <lb/>
her heart a great sorrow for the lost object of her life <lb/>
and affection, is not at all likely to be wanting in a great <lb/>
and generous sympathy for you."</p>
<p>These remarks elicited immense applause, and the whole <lb/>
body of people in the Hall rose simultaneously and <reg orig="mani-|fested">manifested</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="66" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0077"/>
their loyalty by singing a verse of "God save the <lb/>
Queen." We do not know if the Queen ever heard of the <lb/>
speech, but when Mr. Bright lost his wife, a kind message <lb/>
came from Windsor Castle expressing her sympathy in his <lb/>
bereavement.</p>
<p>In the memoir of Rev. Norman Macleod there are many <lb/>
touching references to the Queen. In his Journal under <lb/>
the date of May 14th, 1862, he says: "After dinner I <lb/>
was summoned unexpectedly to the Queen's room. She <lb/>
was alone. She met me, and with an unutterably sad <lb/>
expression which filled my eyes with tears, at once began <lb/>
to speak about the Prince. It is impossible for me to <lb/>
recall distinctly the sequence or substance of that long <lb/>
conversation. She spoke of his excellence, his love, his <lb/>
cheerfulness, how he was everything to her; how all on <lb/>
earth seemed dead to her. She said she never shut her <lb/>
eyes to trials, but liked to look them in the face; how she <lb/>
would never shrink from duty, but that all was at present <lb/>
done mechanically; that her highest ideas of purity and <lb/>
love were obtained from him, and that God could not be <lb/>
displeased with her love. But there was nothing morbid <lb/>
in her grief. I spoke freely to her about all I felt regarding <lb/>
him&mdash;the love of the nation and their sympathy; and took <lb/>
every opportunity of bringing before her the reality of <lb/>
God's love and sympathy, her noble calling as a Queen, <lb/>
the value of her life to the nation, the blessedness of <lb/>
prayer."</p>
<p>The sum of his impressions is given in letter written in <lb/>
1887, before he went to India. "I had a long interview <lb/>
with the Queen. With my last breath I will uphold the <lb/>
excellence and nobleness of her character. It was really <lb/>
grand to hear her talk on moral courage and on living <lb/>
for duty."</p>
<p>The marriage of the Princess Alice to Prince Louis of <lb/>
Hesse, so long delayed, took place very quietly at Osborne <lb/>
<pb n="67" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0078"/>
on July 1st. She was given away by her paternal uncle, <lb/>
the Duke of Saxe-Coburg, the Queen sitting in deep <lb/>
mourning in the background.</p>
<p>The following month the Queen was again at her beloved <lb/>
Balmoral, when she erected the Cairn in memory of the <lb/>
Prince Consort on the Craig Lowrigan. "I and my poor <lb/>
six orphans," she writes, "all placed stones on it, and our <lb/>
initials as well as those of the three absent ones." Below <lb/>
is the inscription chosen by the Princess Royal:&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"He being made perfect in a short time fulfilled a long time;</l>
<l>For his soul pleased the Lord.</l>
<l>Therefore hastened He to take him away from among the wicked.</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>Mr. Leitch, the artist, who was drawing-master to the <lb/>
Queen and Royal Family for twenty-two years, speaks of <lb/>
the sadly altered life at Balmoral.</p>
<p>He writes: "The Queen is still the kind, good, gracious <lb/>
lady that she always was, but I need hardly tell you that <lb/>
there is a change. Indeed, the whole place is changed. <lb/>
Everything very quiet and still. How different from my <lb/>
first visit here!&mdash;the joyous bustle in the morning when the <lb/>
Prince went out; the Highland ponies and the dogs; the <lb/>
gillies and the pipers coming home; the Queen and her <lb/>
ladies going out to meet them; and the merry time <lb/>
afterwards; the torchlight dances on the green, and the <lb/>
servants' ball afterwards."</p>
<p>In the following autumn Her Majesty was induced to <lb/>
resume her sketching.</p>
<p>In September Her Majesty went to Germany. Then was <lb/>
a passing visit to King Leopold at Laeken, when she had <lb/>
her first interview with her future daughter-in-law, the <lb/>
Princess Alexandra of Denmark.</p>
<p>The remains of the Prince Consort were removed, on <lb/>
December 18th, from the vault beneath St. George's Chapel <lb/>
to the Mausoleum at Frogmore. The ceremonial was <lb/>
strictly private.</p>
<pb n="68" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0079"/>
<p>On the following March 7th, London was <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italic">en f&ecirc;te</hi></foreign> to <lb/>
welcome the Prince of Wales' bride-elect, the "Sea-kings <lb/>
daughter from over the sea," the fair young Princess <lb/>
Alexandra. The marriage was solemnised in St. George's <lb/>
Chapel on March 10th, the Queen in her widow's weeds <lb/>
being present in the Royal closet.</p>
<p>On May 9th, Her Majesty visited the Military Hospital <lb/>
of Netley. Seven years before she had laid the foundation <lb/>
stone, accompanied by her beloved husband. In one <lb/>
ward an old soldier from India lay nearly at the point of <lb/>
death. When the Queen had spoken to him, he said, <lb/>
"I thank God that He has allowed me to live long enough <lb/>
to see your Majesty with my own eyes." The Queen and <lb/>
Princess Alice of Hesse, who accompanied her, and who <lb/>
had recently given birth to a daughter at Windsor, were <lb/>
much touched by this loyal speech.</p>
<p>The first public ceremony which the Queen attended <lb/>
was the unveiling of the statue of the Prince Consort at <lb/>
Aberdeen. She appeared much depressed on this occasion.</p>
<p>The following August, on her way to Balmoral, she <lb/>
inaugurated another statue of the Prince Consort at Perth. <lb/>
At the beginning of the year 1865, the Queen showed her <lb/>
deep solicitude for her subjects by causing a letter to be <lb/>
written to the various directors of the railway companies, <lb/>
calling their attention to the increasing number of serious <lb/>
accidents. This important letter received instant attention <lb/>
from the directors and the public press.</p>
<p>In March, Her Majesty went through the Consumption <lb/>
Hospital at Brompton; and in August, after visiting <lb/>
Germany and Rosenau, the Court spent September and <lb/>
October in the Highlands. Princess Alice speaks "of the <lb/>
terrible sufferings" of the first three years of the Queen's <lb/>
widowhood, but adds, "that after the long storm came rest, <lb/>
so that the daughter could tenderly remind the mother, <lb/>
without reopening the wound, of the happy silver wedding <lb/>
<pb n="69" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0080"/>
which might have been this year, when the royal parents <lb/>
would have been surrounded by so many grandchildren <lb/>
in those young households."</p>
<p>In October Lord Palmerston died, and the year closed <lb/>
sorrowfully for the Queen with the death of her beloved <lb/>
uncle and friend, King Leopold.</p>
<p>On February 6th, 1866, the Queen opened the first <lb/>
session of her seventh Parliament. Her Majesty, who wore <lb/>
half-mourning, a deep purple velvet robe trimmed with white <lb/>
ermine, sat silent and wrapt in thought, while the Royal <lb/>
Speech was read by the Lord Chancellor. At the <reg orig="con-|clusion">conclusion</reg> <lb/>
she rose from the throne, kissed the Prince of <lb/>
Wales and shook hands with Prince Christian, and then <lb/>
retired with the usual ceremony.</p>
<p>At this time a new decoration, styled the Albert Medal, <lb/>
was instituted by Royal sign manual. It was to be awarded <lb/>
to those who saved, or endeavoured to save, the lives of <lb/>
others from shipwreck or other perils of the sea. The <lb/>
Queen also sent the eminent American philanthropist, <lb/>
Mr. Peabody, a miniature of herself, and would willingly <lb/>
have conferred on him a baronetcy or Grand Order of the <lb/>
Bath, in gratitude for his munificence to the poor of London, <lb/>
if Mr. Peabody would have accepted it.</p>
<p>Two Royal marriages were solemnised in this year: that <lb/>
of the Princess Mary of Cambridge to the Duke of Teck; <lb/>
and Her Majesty's third daughter, Princess Helena, to <lb/>
Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein&mdash;the bride being in <lb/>
her twenty-first and the bridegroom in his thirty-sixth year. <lb/>
The Queen gave her daughter away.</p>
<p>The war in Germany saw two of the Queen's sons-in-law, <lb/>
the Crown Prince of Prussia and Prince Louis of Hesse, <lb/>
ranged on opposite sides. Austria was utterly worsted, and <lb/>
Prussia ultimately annexed Hanover and Hesse-Cassel.</p>
<p>In October the Queen evinced her usual interest in <lb/>
her people's welfare by opening the fine new waterworks <lb/>
<pb n="70" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0081"/>
at Aberdeen; and she came again forth from her seclusion <lb/>
in the following February, to open Parliament.</p>
<p>In the course of the year the deeply-interesting book <lb/>
entitled "The Early Years of H.R.H. the Prince Consort," <lb/>
compiled under the direction of Her Majesty by Lieut.-Gen. <lb/>
the Hon. C. Grey, made its appearance.</p>
<p>In the May Her Majesty in person laid the first stone <lb/>
of the Hall of Arts and Science at Kensington, afterwards <lb/>
known as the Royal Albert Hall. On this occasion the <lb/>
Prince of Wales read an address to the Queen, who replied, <lb/>
contrary to custom with her, in a scarcely audible voice.</p>
<p>The following May Her Majesty laid the foundation <lb/>
of the new buildings for St. Thomas's Hospital, and in <lb/>
her reply to the address, referred to the founding of the <lb/>
Hospital by her predecessor, Edward VI., and to the great <lb/>
interest taken in it by her late husband. She also alluded <lb/>
to the merciful preservation of her son, the Duke of <reg orig="Edin-|burgh">Edinburgh</reg>, <lb/>
from the hand of an assassin in Port Jackson, New <lb/>
South Wales. He had been shot in the back by a man <lb/>
named O'Farrell, but the ball had been extracted. Before <lb/>
the close of this year the Queen's volume appeared, "Leaves <lb/>
from the Journal of our Life in the Highlands." Her Majesty <lb/>
sent a copy to Charles Dickens, with the graceful words, <lb/>
"From one of the humblest of writers to one of the greatest."</p>
<p>In November 1869 the Queen visited the City for the <lb/>
purpose of opening the new bridge over the Thames at <lb/>
Blackfriars, and the new Viaduct over the Fleet valley, <lb/>
from Holborn Hill to Newgate Street; and the following <lb/>
year, 1870, she was present at a most interesting ceremony, <lb/>
when Her Majesty, accompanied by the Prince and Princess <lb/>
of Wales, opened the new buildings erected for the <reg orig="Univer-|sity">University</reg> <lb/>
of London in Burlington Gardens.</p>
<p>This year was an eventful one for the Continent, for, <lb/>
as Barnett Smith tells us, the war between Germany and <lb/>
France led to the re-making of the map of Europe so far <lb/>
<pb n="71" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0082"/>
as these countries were concerned, and the Emperor and <lb/>
Empress of the French were driven into exile, and took <lb/>
up their abode at Chislehurst. During the autumn of this <lb/>
year, while the Queen and her family were at Balmoral, <lb/>
Princess Louise became engaged to the Marquis of Lorne, <lb/>
eldest son of the Duke of Argyle. The marriage took place <lb/>
the following March at St. George's, and the Duke of <lb/>
Argyle attracted much notice by appearing in the "garb <lb/>
of old Gaul, with kilt, philibeg, sporran and claymore <lb/>
complete." Rooms were allotted to the young couple in <lb/>
Kensington Palace.</p>
<p>Her Majesty opened the Royal Albert Hall on March 29th, <lb/>
and on June 21st the new St. Thomas's Hospital, and <lb/>
knighted the treasurer, Mr. Francis Hill. In November the <lb/>
news of the Prince of Wales's illness from typhoid fever <lb/>
created great solicitude. For some days there was intense <lb/>
anxiety, for the Prince's life was in imminent danger; but <lb/>
on December 14th, the anniversary of the Prince Consort's <lb/>
death from the same fever, there was a slight improvement <lb/>
in his condition, and from that date he continued to <reg orig="im-|prove">improve</reg>. <lb/>
The universal sympathy shown by the whole country <lb/>
during those terrible days of suspense made a lasting <reg orig="im-|pression">impression</reg> <lb/>
on the Queen.</p>
<p>February 27th, 1872, was observed as a day of national <lb/>
thanksgiving. The Queen, with the Prince and Princess <lb/>
of Wales and Princess Beatrice, went in state to St. Paul's, <lb/>
where a solemn Te Deum was sung.</p>
<p>During the next few years events came thick and fast, <lb/>
some of them very nearly affecting the Queen. The death <lb/>
of her valued friend and spiritual adviser, Dr. Norman <lb/>
Macleod, was a sad loss to Her Majesty; and soon <reg orig="after-|wards">afterwards</reg> <lb/>
she laid the foundation stone of a monument to <lb/>
her dear friend the Duchess of Sutherland in the grounds <lb/>
of Dunrobin Castle. Shortly after this the Queen received <lb/>
news of the death of her beloved sister, Princess Feodora, <lb/>
<pb n="72" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0083"/>
the Dowager Princess of Hohenlohe-Langenburg. In <lb/>
January 1873 the Emperor Napoleon died at Chislehurst; <lb/>
and in the following May a fatal accident befel one of the <lb/>
Queen's grandsons, Prince Frederick William of Hesse, <lb/>
who fell from a window at Darmstadt and was killed.</p>
<p>On January 23rd, 1874, the Duke of Edinburgh was <lb/>
married to the Grand Duchess Marie of Russia, the <lb/>
ceremony taking place in the Winter Palace at St. Petersburg.</p>
<p>In April of this year Her Majesty visited Gosport, and <lb/>
inspected the sailors and marines of the Royal Navy who <lb/>
had taken part in the war against the Ashantees. At a later <lb/>
period she conferred medals on nine seamen and marines.</p>
<p>On the occasion of the Jubilee Meeting of the Royal <lb/>
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the Queen <lb/>
addressed a letter to the President, Lord Harrowby, <lb/>
"expressing her deep interest in the success of the efforts <lb/>
made at home and abroad for the purpose of diminishing <lb/>
the cruelties on dumb animals."</p>
<p>There appeared this year the first volume of Sir Theodore <lb/>
Martin's "Life of the Prince Consort"; and among other <lb/>
tributes to his memory was the erection of a statue at <lb/>
the termination of the Holborn Viaduct.</p>
<p>The Queen was prevented from opening Parliament this <lb/>
year by the alarming illness of her youngest son, Prince <lb/>
Leopold, from typhoid fever; but he eventually recovered. <lb/>
As Princess Alice remarks, "He had already been given <lb/>
back three times to his family from the brink of the grave.</p>
<p>In October the Prince of Wales left England for a <lb/>
lengthened tour through Her Majesty's Indian dominions.</p>
<p>The Queen made many public appearances this year; <lb/>
amongst them she opened a new wing of the London <lb/>
Hospital, which had been built by the Grocers' Company. <lb/>
She also erected a memorial cross to the memory of her <lb/>
personal friend, Lady Augusta Stanley, at Frogmore.</p>
<p>In 1877 Her Majesty visited Lord Beaconsfield at <lb/>
<pb n="73" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0084"/>
Hughenden. It is also worthy of note that her first <lb/>
grandchild, Princess Charlotte of Prussia, was married to <lb/>
the Hereditary Prince of Saxe-Meiningen; and in the <lb/>
same year her cousin, Princess Elizabeth of Prussia, to the <lb/>
Hereditary Grand Duke of Oldenburg. A grievous trouble <lb/>
came to the Queen in December. On the seventeenth <lb/>
anniversary of the Prince Consort's death, her good and <lb/>
beloved daughter, the Princess Alice of Hesse, died of <lb/>
diphtheria at Darmstadt. Few princesses have been more <lb/>
loved and revered.</p>
<p>The following March the Duke of Connaught was <lb/>
married at St. George's to the Princess Louise of Prussia, <lb/>
and in May Her Majesty received the news of the birth <lb/>
of her first great-grandchild, the daughter of the Princess of <lb/>
Saxe-Meiningen.</p>
<p>The Queen was in her Highland retreat when the <lb/>
sad news of the Prince Imperial's death, killed in the <lb/>
Zulu war, reached her. She felt it very deeply, and <lb/>
wrote in her Journal: "To think of that dear young man, <lb/>
the apple of his mother's eye, born and nurtured in <lb/>
purple, dying thus is too fearful, too awful; and <reg orig="in-|explicable">inexplicable</reg> <lb/>
and dreadful that the others should not have <lb/>
turned round and fought for him. It is too horrible!"</p>
<p>In 1887 another attempt was made on the Queen's life. <lb/>
A man named Roger Maclean fired at her, but on the plea <lb/>
of insanity he was sentenced to be confined during Her <lb/>
Majesty's pleasure. During this year the marriage of the <lb/>
Duke of Albany to Princess Helen of Waldeck took place, <lb/>
and the young couple had Claremont assigned to them. <lb/>
When the Egyptian War broke out, the Duke of Connaught <lb/>
accompanied Sir Garnett Wolseley. The news of the great <lb/>
victory at Tel-el-kebir gave great joy. The telegram that <lb/>
reached the Queen said, "The Duke of Connaught is well, <lb/>
and behaved admirably, leading his brigade to the attack."</p>
<p>The new Law Courts in the Strand were formally opened <lb/>
<pb n="74" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0085"/>
by the Queen in December. The following March the <lb/>
Queen sustained a severe accident; she slipped upon some <lb/>
stairs at Windsor and sprained her knee. For about a year <lb/>
it was a source of pain and much discomfort.</p>
<p>In 1884 the Duke of Albany died at Cannes from a fit of <lb/>
apoplexy; and in 1885 Her Majesty's youngest child, <lb/>
Princess Beatrice, married Prince Henry of Battenberg in <lb/>
Whippingham Church, Isle of Wight.</p>
<p>There were numerous other good works inaugurated by <lb/>
the Queen during the next few years: the laying of the <lb/>
foundation stone of the new Medical Examination Hall of <lb/>
the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons on the <lb/>
Thames Embankment; the opening of the Colonial and <lb/>
Indian Exhibition at South Kensington, the Liverpool <lb/>
Exhibition, and the Royal Holloway College for Women at <lb/>
Mount Lee, Egham; and also of the People's Palace at the <lb/>
East End, in the May preceding Jubilee Day. There have <lb/>
been three royal jubilees in the history of England, but <lb/>
none of them can compare with the Jubilee of June 21st, <lb/>
1887, unless it be the Jubilee of 1897, when our beloved <lb/>
Sovereign commemorated the sixtieth year of her reign. It <lb/>
was a sight that thrilled all hearts when the Queen left her <lb/>
palace gates that June morning, surrounded by her glorious <lb/>
guard of honour, sons, sons-in-law and grandsons, on her <lb/>
way to Westminster Abbey. The fair young Queen of fifty <lb/>
years before was now a grey-haired woman, but the loving <lb/>
heart still responded to her faithful subjects' acclamations. <lb/>
Since then our beloved Sovereign has celebrated her Sixtieth <lb/>
Jubilee, and those ten years have brought her many fresh <lb/>
sorrows. The loss of her three sons-in-law, the noble <lb/>
Emperor Frederick, the Grand Duke Louis of Hesse, and <lb/>
Prince Henry of Battenberg, and the death of her beloved <lb/>
grandson, Prince Victor, were heavy troubles, and her <lb/>
tender sympathy with her widowed daughters was their <lb/>
greatest comfort.</p>
<pb n="75" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0086"/>
<p>There can be little doubt, as Barnett Smith tells us, that <lb/>
"Her Majesty has outlived all her early friends and faithful <lb/>
servants. All who officiated at her coronation have passed <lb/>
into the land of shadows. If she has tasted all the happiness <lb/>
of life, she has tasted likewise its bitterness, for death has <lb/>
ever been busy laying his finger here and there upon her <lb/>
beloved friends, relatives and associates.&hellip; The Queen's <lb/>
reign is coincident with the most surprising progress at <lb/>
home and abroad. It has been the age of railways, of <lb/>
trans-oceanic steamers and of the telegraph, of free trade, <lb/>
parliamentary reform, and the abolition of the corn laws."</p>
<p>The late Earl of Carlisle once happily observed that the <lb/>
glories of Her Majesty's reign were "the glories of peace, <lb/>
of industry, of commerce, of genius; of justice made more <lb/>
accessible; of education made more universal; of virtue <lb/>
more honoured; of religion more beloved; of holding forth <lb/>
the earliest gospel light to the unawakened natives; the <lb/>
glories that arise from gratitude for benefits conferred; and <lb/>
the blessings of a loyal and chivalrous because contented <lb/>
people."</p>
<p>For sixty years our dear Lady has sat on her imperial <lb/>
throne, and her firm serene rule, keen intellect, and wide <lb/>
sympathies have blessed her mighty empire. As Mrs. Tooley <lb/>
has beautifully observed: "The Queen will live in history <lb/>
as the most enlightened and consistent of constitutional <lb/>
monarchs, as well as being revered as a great and noble <lb/>
woman. Those who have been privileged to enjoy her <lb/>
friendship all speak of the beautiful blending of <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italic">na&iuml;vet&eacute;</hi></foreign> and <lb/>
kindness with great personal dignity which render her so <lb/>
charming in private life."</p>
<p>The Queen is growing old now, and her infirmity <reg orig="pre-|vents">prevents</reg> <lb/>
all active exercise; but her daily work is still as heavy <lb/>
as ever. For some years past, we are told in that charming <lb/>
little book, "The Private Life of the Queen," by one of her <lb/>
servants, "the Queen's health and strength have largely <lb/>

depended on her being almost perpetually in the open air; <lb/>
and it is necessity, not choice, that obliges her to do her <lb/>
morning's work out of doors. At Windsor the little <reg orig="Frog-|more">Frogmore</reg> <lb/>
tea-house, with its lovely surroundings, is the chosen <lb/>
spot; and here, beneath the shade of two magnificent <reg orig="ever-|green">evergreen</reg> <lb/>
oaks, the Queen's writing-table and despatch-boxes <lb/>
are set out on fine mornings, while two mounted messengers <lb/>
keep up perpetual communication with the telegraph office <lb/>
and telephones at the Castle; and the attendant secretary <lb/>
stands at her side.&hellip; In addition to the public work, the <lb/>
self-imposed private work done by Her Majesty is <reg orig="extra-|ordinary">extraordinary</reg>. <lb/>
Every word of the Parliamentary report which is <lb/>
daily made to her by the leader of the House of Commons <lb/>
is perused by her, and not unfrequently annotated in her <lb/>
own hand before being filed." And in another passage: <lb/>
"Apart from state business, it has been proved that the <lb/>
Queen is the greatest correspondent of the day, not only as <lb/>
regards the letters she receives and reads, but those she <lb/>
indites with her own hand in reply. A point on which the <lb/>
Queen is extremely punctilious is the insistence that, unless <lb/>
debarred by illness, all her children shall write to her once <lb/>
every day.&hellip; Her Majesty is a most introspective <reg orig="letter-|writer">letter-writer</reg>, <lb/>
and only cares for letters of a like quality." Her <lb/>
letters to the nation at times of public trouble and rejoicing <lb/>
are truly admirable; and it is worthy of record that when any <lb/>
catastrophe or accident happens, any disaster by land or sea, <lb/>
a message of womanly sympathy is flashed from Windsor or <lb/>
Osborne to the unhappy survivors. To add to Her Majesty's <lb/>
labours; it is now known that she has taken up the study <lb/>
of Hindustani, and that the Empress of India writes her <lb/>
diary in that language. It has been said, "that if the <lb/>
Queen had been destined to write in lieu of ruling, she <lb/>
must have left a great mark on the literature of the <lb/>
country."</p>
<p>When, as it has been touchingly said, "the day of <lb/>
<pb n="77" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0088"/>
England's sorrow dawns," and "she is laid to rest in the <lb/>
place where she so often goes to pray on Sunday," surely <lb/>
there will be a great cry through this vast empire, like that <lb/>
one of old in Egypt, "when there was not a house where <lb/>
there was not one dead." God grant that that time may <lb/>
be far from us, and that our great and good Queen may <lb/>
long be spared to us, and in the words of that sweet poem <lb/>
by Helen Marion Burnside&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">

<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> name of Florence Nightingale has long become a <lb/>
household word; and although, since her return from <lb/>
the Crimea in 1856, broken health and bodily infirmity <lb/>
have compelled her to live in enforced seclusion, that <lb/>
honoured name is still as dear as ever to the hearts of <lb/>
English men and English women.</p>
<p>With the exception of the pious and high-souled Elizabeth <lb/>
Fry, there is no brighter example of devotion to duty in <lb/>
the whole of the Victorian era than this delicate and highly <lb/>
born woman, whose noble and untiring efforts to relieve the <lb/>
sufferings of her fellow-creatures entailed on her a lifelong <lb/>
martyrdom of pain. As it has been well said by a recent <lb/>
writer, Mrs. Tooley, "It required a more indomitable <lb/>
spirit, a nobler courage, to work in the pestilential hospital <lb/>
at Scutari, to walk for twenty hours at a time the miles of <lb/>
fetid and overcrowded corridors wherein lay the sick, the <lb/>
wounded and the dying, than in the heat of battle to go <lb/>
'down into the jaws of death,' as did the noble Six <lb/>
Hundred."</p>
<p>"Do not write of me until I am gone," are her own <lb/>
<pb n="82" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0095"/>
touching words, and as far as Miss Nightingale's private life <lb/>
is concerned, one is bound to respect her wish for privacy; <lb/>
but her work during the Crimean War belongs to history, <lb/>
nor would the record be complete without the mention of <lb/>
the heroic band of women who devoted themselves to the <lb/>
sick and wounded soldiers.</p>
<p>Two or three years ago a charming sketch, from the <reg orig="well-|known">well-known</reg> <lb/>
pen of Sarah A. Tooley, appeared in the pages of <lb/>
the <hi rend="italic">Temple Magazine</hi>, which gives us many interesting <reg orig="par-|ticulars">particulars</reg> <lb/>
of the childhood and youth of Florence Nightingale. <lb/>
The description of her home at Lea Hurst deserves to be <lb/>
quoted in full.</p>
<p>"Tourists in the Matlock district still make Lea Hurst <lb/>
a place of resort, for not only is it indelibly associated with <lb/>
the name of Florence Nightingale, but it is a place of <lb/>
ideal loveliness.</p>
<p>"It stands in an extensive park upon a plateau <reg orig="over-|looking">overlooking</reg> <lb/>
'Dove's romantic Peak,' and in the distance are <lb/>
lovely views of the Peak country. The Hall is built in the <lb/>
form of a cross, with gables at the extremities and sides. <lb/>
It is approached by an imposing gateway, with massive <lb/>
posts surmounted by globes of stone; a smooth shaven <lb/>
lawn lies peacefully about it, and gardens, avenues and <lb/>
shrubberies lend their charm to the picture. On this <lb/>
breezy site, above the picturesquely winding Derwent, Lea <lb/>
Hurst stands, with its Gothic turrets and many gables, like <lb/>
some old Hall of feudal times. Large bay windows jutting <lb/>
out into the grounds render the low rooms bright and <lb/>
cheerful."</p>
<p>Another notice is given by Dr. Spencer T. Hall. After <lb/>
describing some rural scenery in Northamptonshire, the <lb/>
Doctor goes on to say: "But in the whole of the lovely <lb/>
view, never seemed a spot more fair or attractive than the <lb/>
old and many-gabled rural seat of Lea Hurst, henceforth <lb/>
classic, the English home of Florence Nightingale, whose <lb/>
<pb n="83" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0096"/>
name, like Grace Darling's, now quickens the beat of <lb/>
millions of hearts. Some people are born with a genius for <lb/>
nursing and solacing, as much as others are with a genius <lb/>
for music or dancing or poetry, and Miss Nightingale may <lb/>
be regarded as the archetype of her order. Her spirit first <lb/>
showed itself in an interest for the sick poor in the hamlets <lb/>
round Lea Hurst, but at length found a sphere requiring <lb/>
more attention and energy in Continental hospitals, and <lb/>
afterwards in London, where she took the office of matron <lb/>
to a retreat for decayed gentlewomen; and now she is gone <lb/>
to tend and to heal the wounds of the sufferers by the siege <lb/>
of Sebastopol. What a contrast to the quiet, pastoral <lb/>
retirement of this vale of Holloway, with its fireside <lb/>
memories, its rural delights."</p>
<p>Florence Nightingale's real birthplace was Florence, "the <lb/>
city of flowers." She was born on May 15th, 1820. She <lb/>
was the younger daughter of Mr. William Shore <reg orig="Nightin-|gale">Nightingale</reg>, <lb/>
of Embley Park, Hampshire, and Lea Hurst, <reg orig="Derby-|shire">Derbyshire</reg>. <lb/>
She and her sister, the late Lady Verney, became <lb/>
co-heiresses of Mr. Nightingale's properties. Her mother <lb/>
was the daughter of the well-known abolitionist, Mr. Smith, <lb/>
M.P., member for Norwich.</p>
<p>Mr. Nightingale was a man of scholarly taste, and <lb/>
favoured the higher education of women; and before his <lb/>
younger daughter had reached her seventeenth year, Mrs. <lb/>
Tooley tells us "that she was skilled in science, classics <lb/>
and mathematics, had a wide acquaintance with standard <lb/>
literature, was a fair artist, a good musician, and an <reg orig="excel-|lent">excellent</reg> <lb/>
linguist&mdash;speaking French, German and Italian with <lb/>
equal fluency."</p>
<p>The sisters lived free, happy lives. Florence Nightingale <lb/>
was particularly fond of animals, and it is interesting to hear <lb/>
that her first attempt at nursing was performed on an old <lb/>
Scotch shepherd's dog with an injured leg. From that day, <lb/>
we are told, "that it became a custom when any one had a <lb/>
<pb n="84" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0097"/>
cut or bruise, or a sick animal, to send for Miss Florence." <lb/>
And in another passage, Mrs. Tooley tells us, "During her <lb/>
girlhood she was chief almoner to the cottages around her <lb/>
home, and nursed all illnesses under the advice of her <lb/>
mother and the vicar, who, in his youth, had studied <lb/>
medicine. Her favourite books were those that dealt <lb/>
with the alleviation of human suffering and misery, and it <lb/>
seemed as though her whole nature were impelled in that <lb/>
direction. She became, while still a young girl, interested <lb/>
in the prison work of Elizabeth Fry, and paid a memorable <lb/>
visit to that veteran friend of humanity in her London <lb/>
home."</p>
<p>The ordinary routine of London social life had few <lb/>
attractions for Florence Nightingale. We hear that she <lb/>
and her sister were presented, but very shortly afterwards <lb/>
she withdrew from all gaieties. The call, "Come up <lb/>
higher," had already sounded in her ears. During the next <lb/>
few years she gave her attention to the condition of <lb/>
hospitals. After a systematic inspection of those in <reg orig="Lon-|don">London</reg>, <lb/>
Dublin, and Edinburgh, she visited civil and military <lb/>
hospitals all over Europe, and in 1851 went into training <lb/>
as a nurse in the Institution of Protestant Deaconesses, at <lb/>
Kaiserswerth on the Rhine. This institution was founded <lb/>
by Pastor Fliedner, who, we are told, "did for the prisons <lb/>
of Germany what Howard had done for those of England." <lb/>
She further supplemented her training by afterwards <reg orig="study-|ing">studying</reg> <lb/>
with the Sisters of St. Vincent de Paul, in Paris. After <lb/>
a period of much needed rest at Lea Hurst, Miss <reg orig="Nightin-|gale">Nightingale</reg> <lb/>
undertook the management of an institution for sick <lb/>
and aged governesses, at 47, Harley Street, and devoted <lb/>
herself, with energy and ardour, to the reorganisation of <lb/>
this institution, which remains to-day as a monument of <lb/>
her work and method. A lady who visited her in Harley <lb/>
Street said, "She was to be found in the midst of the <lb/>
various duties of a hospital, for the Home was largely <lb/>
<pb n="85" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0098"/>
a Sanatorium, organising the nurses, attending to the <lb/>
correspondence, prescriptions and accounts; in short, per <lb/>
forming all the duties of a hard-working matron, as well as <lb/>
largely financing the institution."</p>
<p>The strain of such heavy work on Miss Nightingale's <lb/>
delicate constitution became too much, and again the <lb/>
indomitable worker was obliged to return to Lea Hurst for <lb/>
rest. For ten years she had served her apprenticeship in <lb/>
preparation for the work of her life; when the call came it <lb/>
found her ready. She was then about thirty-four.</p>
<p>When war broke out between England and Russia, in <lb/>
March 1854, the hospital arrangements of the British <lb/>
army were in a very imperfect state. The army while <lb/>
at Varna suffered from a deficient number of surgeons, <lb/>
though many courageous volunteers offered themselves. A <lb/>
hospital was established at Scutari, a port of the Turkish <lb/>
capital, and was intended for the wounded soldiers. There <lb/>
was also a naval hospital at Therapia, which was clean <lb/>
and orderly, and supplied with everything requisite for <lb/>
a well-managed hospital. Before the year 1854 expired <lb/>
there existed also for the army "The General Hospital," <lb/>
the Barrack Hospital, and two floating hospitals; there <lb/>
was also a hospital for Russian prisoners at Kulali, on <lb/>
the Bosphorus. "Subsequently, and as the result of the <lb/>
agitation in England, what was called the Civilian Hospital <lb/>
was established at Smyrna. But it was at Scutari that the <lb/>
great evils were prevalent, the great horrors enacted, and <lb/>
the indelible shame upon our country inflicted." There <lb/>
is no sadder chapter of human history than that of the <lb/>
Crimean War, and yet the causes of all these miseries <lb/>
have never been adequately traced. The grossest <reg orig="mis-|management">mismanagement</reg> <lb/>
seemed to have prevailed; the transport <lb/>
service was inadequate; the stores of warm clothing, <reg orig="great-|coats">greatcoats</reg>, <lb/>
blankets and huts, which had been ordered for the <lb/>
protection of the army in winter, failed to reach them for <lb/>
<pb n="86" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0099"/>
weeks after the English newspapers told of the comforts <lb/>
provided for the troops. "What a mockery it must have <lb/>
seemed to the poor fellows, who with scanty rations, and <lb/>
in threadbare and tattered clothes, were enduring the most <lb/>
cruel fatigues, aggravated by all the inclemencies of wind <lb/>
and rain, and snow and cold, upon the bleak heights of <lb/>
the Tauric Chersonese!" Well may Miss Marsh, in her <lb/>
"Memorials of Captain Hedley Vicars," tell us that the <lb/>
miseries of the winter before Sebastopol have passed into <lb/>
history!</p>
<p>"Battles," as she remarks, "won on the cold soil of <lb/>
the Crimea by weary men, worn down by hunger, bore <lb/>
terrible witness to the quenchless nature of British courage. <lb/>
The men who stormed the heights of Alma, who in the <lb/>
dreadful fight of Inkermann conquered again and again, <lb/>
amidst fogs and darkness, of whom a mere handful at <lb/>
Balaklava were seen 'charging an army while all the world <lb/>
wondered'; such men have proved their steel. Yet there <lb/>
is a limit to human endurance; and when men of this <lb/>
mould have been seen 'to weep,' as on night after night, <lb/>
succeeding days of starvation and toil, they were ordered <lb/>
to their work in the freezing trenches, who can estimate <lb/>
the exhausting misery they had at first endured?" But <lb/>
long before this deadly winter had closed in on our <lb/>
devoted army, public indignation in England had reached <lb/>
its climax, when Sir Robert Peel disclosed in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> <lb/>
the awful suffering of the wounded after the battle of Alma <lb/>
Nolan's "History of the War" gives almost incredible <lb/>
accounts.</p>
<p>In spite of individual merit, every branch of the medical <lb/>
department of the army in the East worked badly. "No <lb/>
nurses were provided, and the medical orderlies were taken <lb/>
from the ranks, raw and untrained. The ambulance carts <lb/>
and waggons were so heavy as to be altogether unserviceable; <lb/>
even had they been fit, no horses were at hand to draw <lb/>
<pb n="87" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0100"/>
them.&hellip; The commonest necessaries for field hospitals&mdash; <lb/>
bedding, medicines, and medical comforts&mdash;were wanting, <lb/>
and not a single operating table was supplied to the <lb/>
army."</p>
<p>In another passage we read: "It might without <reg orig="ex-|aggeration">exaggeration</reg> <lb/>
be said, that not one yard from the trenches <lb/>
before Sebastopol to the hospital or cemetery at Scutari, <lb/>
was the poor soldier carried, without an amount of suffering <lb/>
being inflicted on him barbarous in the extreme, and <lb/>
which any previous preparation might have averted."</p>
<p>A medical officer writing home from the camp thus <lb/>
describes the outset of the unfortunate candidate for the <lb/>
corridors of Scutari!</p>
<p>"I often look back at the misery and wretchedness I <lb/>
have witnessed in England in my attendance on the sick <lb/>
poor, but in comparing these with my present everyday <lb/>
experience, their condition was Elysium itself; for when <lb/>
I tell you that the sick in this place have no other couch <lb/>
than the bare ground itself, saturated with wet, and a <lb/>
dripping canvas only between them and the clouds, you <lb/>
will perfectly comprehend that the veriest hovel would be <lb/>
a palace in comparison."</p>
<p>When the wounded were placed on board fresh miseries <lb/>
awaited. "The men lay between decks without any <lb/>
bedding, and often without a blanket, in the depth of winter." <lb/>
Invalids attended invalids, or they were unattended. There <lb/>
was plenty of pork and hard biscuits, but no proper food <lb/>
for the sick. "In this state," we read, "they lay from five <lb/>
to twenty days, according to weather." Some of the men <lb/>
literally died of cold or want of food. And "in several of <lb/>
these sick transports the poor fellows nearly perished for <lb/>
want of water; and on board one ship the sufferings of the <lb/>
men from this cause were appalling, although there was <lb/>
water on board in sufficient quantities to meet their wants, <lb/>
but it could not be got at from the confusion which <lb/>
<pb n="88" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0101"/>
prevailed in the mode in which the cargo was packed <lb/>
away.</p>
<p>At Scutari a new series of suffering commenced; and in <lb/>
the Rev. Sydney Osborne's volume entitled, "Scutari and <lb/>
its Hospitals," we are told the miseries of the poor fellows <lb/>
increased at every step. When they were free of the pier <lb/>
they "were carried, exposed to cold or drenching rain, to <lb/>
the nearest hospital, to be told perhaps that there was no <lb/>
room, then carried probably to the General Hospital, and <lb/>
finally deposited in the corridors of the Barrack Hospital. <lb/>
Many sank into untimely death in these dark corridors. <lb/>
Within these hospitals confusion and misery prevailed. <lb/>
Humane hearts ache even now to peruse the ghastly <lb/>
details." More than three thousand men were lying on <lb/>
the bare ground in these hospitals, while bedsteads and <lb/>
bed-fittings were lying at Varna neglected "There were no <lb/>
vessels for water, no utensils of any kind, no soap, towels <lb/>
or cloths, no hospital clothes; the men lay in their uniforms <lb/>
stiff with gore, &hellip; their persons covered with vermin.&hellip; <lb/>
The medical men toiled with an unwearied assiduity&mdash;never <lb/>
did men deserve better of their country&mdash;but the numbers <lb/>
were inadequate to the work, and they had no means of <lb/>
procuring what was necessary." To add to the appalling <lb/>
details, Mr. Osborne and other faithful eye-witnesses record <lb/>
the awful fact, that "the wounded soldiers of England <lb/>
in many cases died of starvation in the hospitals provided <lb/>
for them by their country."</p>
<p>Such was the state of things at the close of 1854, and <lb/>
to some extent during the remainder of the winter. But <lb/>
help was at hand. The head of the War Department <lb/>
was Mr. Sidney Herbert, afterwards Lord Herbert of Lea. <lb/>
He was an enlightened and far-sighted man; he knew of <lb/>
Miss Nightingale's interest in nursing, and he wrote to <lb/>
her. Some ladies had already volunteered their services, <lb/>
and a staff of female nurses was being formed, and he <lb/>
<pb n="89" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0102"/>
asked her to undertake the superintendence of the lady <lb/>
nurses and to organise the operations. By a strange <lb/>
coincidence, the very day Mr. Sidney Herbert wrote <lb/>
his memorable letter, Florence Nightingale had actually <lb/>
written to him offering her services to the sick and wounded <lb/>
in the Hospital at Scutari. The letters had crossed. Great <lb/>
must have been her surprise when she read his, asking her <lb/>
to take command of the little nursing band, and leave for <lb/>
the East in eight days. Short was the notice, nevertheless <lb/>
Miss Nightingale had everything ready; and on October <lb/>
21st, 1854, and accompanied by her friends, Mr. and <lb/>
Mrs. Bracebridge, of Atherstane Hall, Yorkshire, and a <lb/>
band of thirty-eight nurses, she left England on her great <lb/>
mission.</p>
<p>The ladies who were chosen out of the vast number of <lb/>
volunteers comprised six from St. John's House, <reg orig="West-|minster">Westminster</reg>, <lb/>
eight from Miss Sellon's House of Sisters in <lb/>
Devonshire, ten Roman Catholic Sisters of Charity, and <lb/>
fourteen hospital nurses. When this "angel band," as <lb/>
Kinglake calls them, arrived at Boulogne, the fisherwomen <lb/>
carried their luggage as a labour of love. They reached <lb/>
Scutari on November 5th, in time to receive the wounded <lb/>
from the Battle of Inkermann. On their arrival they set <lb/>
at once to the performance of their arduous duties. <reg orig="Inde-|scribably">Indescribably</reg> <lb/>
horrible was the state of the hospital when Miss <lb/>
Nightingale made her first inspection. Sanitary <reg orig="arrange-|ments">arrangements</reg> <lb/>
were <hi rend="italic">nil</hi>. The beds were reeking with infection. <lb/>
Outside the hospital was a hotbed of pestilence. Hercules' <lb/>
labour in clearing the Augean stables could only be <reg orig="com-|pared">compared</reg> <lb/>
to the awful task that lay before those devoted <lb/>
women. A tower at one of the corners of the Barrack <lb/>
Hospital gave them accommodation.</p>
<p>Mr. Osborne gives us a description of the part allotted <lb/>
to the nurses:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Entering the door leading into the Sisters' Tower," he <lb/>
<pb n="90" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0103"/>
writes, "you at once found yourself a spectator of a busy and <lb/>
interesting scene. There is a large room with two or three <lb/>
doors opening from it on one side; on the other, one door <lb/>
opening into an apartment in which many of the nurses and <lb/>
sisters slept, and had, I believe, their meals. In the centre <lb/>
was a large kitchen-table; bustling about this might be <lb/>
seen the high-priestess of the room, Mrs. C<gap desc="long dash" reason="missing" id="g1"/>. Often as <lb/>
I have had occasion to pass through this room I do not <lb/>
recollect ever finding her absent from it or unoccupied. <lb/>
At this table she received the various matters from the <lb/>
kitchen and stores of the sisterhood, which attendant sisters <lb/>
or nurses were ever ready to take to the sick in any and <lb/>
every part of these gigantic hospitals. It was a curious <lb/>
scene, and a close study of it afforded a practical lesson in <lb/>
the working of true common-sense benevolence.&hellip; The <lb/>
floor on one side of the room was loaded with packages of <lb/>
all kinds&mdash;stores of things for the internal and external <lb/>
consumption of the patients; bales of shirts, socks, <lb/>
slippers, dressing-gowns, flannel, heaps of every sort of <lb/>
article likely to be of use in affording comfort and securing <lb/>
cleanliness. It gave me some idea of what such a room <lb/>
would be in a good hospital, if on some sudden alarm it <lb/>
had been made a refuge for articles snatched from its every <lb/>
store. In reality it was one feature of a bold attempt upon <lb/>
the part of extraneous benevolence to supply the deficiencies <lb/>
of the various departments, which, as a matter of course, <lb/>
should have supplied all these things. In an adjoining <lb/>
room were held those councils over which Miss Nightingale <lb/>
so ably presided, at which were discussed the measures <lb/>
necessary to meet the daily varying exigencies of the <lb/>
hospital. From hence were given the orders which <reg orig="regu-|lated">regulated</reg> <lb/>
the female staff working under this most gifted head <lb/>
This, too, was the office from which were sent those many <lb/>
letters to the Government, to friends and supporters at <lb/>
home, telling such awful tales of the sufferings of the sick <lb/>
<pb n="91" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0104"/>
and wounded, their utter want of so many necessaries. <lb/>
There might be seen the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> almoner, taking down in his <lb/>
note-book from day to day the list of things he was pressed <lb/>
to obtain, which might all, with a little activity, have been <lb/>
provided as easily by the authorities of the hospital."</p>
<p>We have quoted this exhaustive and interesting description <lb/>
in full, as it gives a wonderful insight into the working of <lb/>
that masterly mind, and the untiring energy that planned <lb/>
and organised everything. From the first the indomitable <lb/>
will of "the Lady-in-chief," as she was called, made itself <lb/>
felt in every department, which gradually broke down all <lb/>
obstacles raised by the jealousy or bad tempers of the <lb/>
officials. As Nolan tells us, "Doctors, purveyors, <reg orig="store-|keepers">storekeepers</reg>, <lb/>
orderlies, inspectors, dispensers, and interpreters <lb/>
were in the uttermost confusion amongst themselves, and <lb/>
they generally regarded these gentle missionaries as a new <lb/>
element of anarchy."</p>
<p>As Kinglake says most beautifully: "It was not only <lb/>
under her reign, but by force of her actual sway, that order <lb/>
sprang out of chaos; that the hell she had found when <lb/>
she came knew at last the blessing of cleanliness; that the <lb/>
administration of our Levantine hospitals began to seem <lb/>
almost perfect.&hellip; She brought to her self-imposed task <lb/>
that forethought, that agile brain-power, that organising and <lb/>
governing faculty of which our country had need."</p>
<p>At the end of six months the hospital arrangements had <lb/>
been brought into order. Kitchens and laundries had been <lb/>
established. "All England," as Mrs. Tooley tells us in her <lb/>
article, "from the Queen to the humblest peasant, were <lb/>
making warm garments and preparing lint and bandages <lb/>
for the soldiers. The Patriotic Fund for the relief of the <lb/>
widows and orphans rose by leaps and bounds, until within <lb/>
a year it amounted to one million pounds."</p>
<p>The author of "Two Months in the Camp before <reg orig="Sebas-|topol">Sebastopol</reg>" <lb/>
gives a brief description of the Lady-in-chief: "In <lb/>
<pb n="92" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0105"/>
the outer room," he writes, "we caught a momentary <lb/>
glimpse of the justly celebrated Miss Nightingale, the fair <lb/>
heroine of Scutari; an amiable and highly intelligent-looking <lb/>
lady of some thirty summers, delicate in form and <reg orig="prepos-|sessing">prepossessing</reg> <lb/>
in her appearance. Her energies were concentrated <lb/>
for the instant in the careful preparation of a dish of <reg orig="delect-|able">delectable</reg> <lb/>
food for an enfeebled patient&mdash;one of her homely <lb/>
ministrations to the wan victims of relentless war, for whose <lb/>
relief she so readily and nobly sacrificed the comforts of her <lb/>
quiet happy English home."</p>
<p>There are some interesting passages in Nolan's "History" <lb/>
which give us an idea of the work of this wonderful woman, <lb/>
collected from the letters of Mr. Osborne, Mr. Bracebridge, <lb/>
Mr. Macdonald, and her faithful and zealous young helper, <lb/>
"Mr. Stafford, who sat by the bedside of the patients, <lb/>
reading for them the letters of their friends, and acting as <lb/>
letter-writer-general on their behalf." "She, Miss <reg orig="Nightin-|gale">Nightingale</reg>, <lb/>
had to tend, or see tended, thousands of sick men." <lb/>
And again: "I was with her when various surgical <lb/>
operations were performed, and she was more than equal <lb/>
to the trial. She has an utter disregard to contagion. I <lb/>
have known her spend hours over men dying of cholera <lb/>
or fever."</p>
<p>When Mr. Macdonald was about to return to England he <lb/>
wrote concerning this queen of nurses: "Wherever there is <lb/>
disease in its most dangerous form, and the hand of the <lb/>
spoiler distressingly nigh, there is this incomparable woman <lb/>
sure to be seen. Her benignant presence is an influence <lb/>
for good comfort even amid the struggles of expiring nature. <lb/>
She is a 'ministering angel' without any exaggeration in <lb/>
these hospitals; and as her slender form glides quietly along <lb/>
each corridor every poor fellow's face softens with gratitude <lb/>
at the sight of her. When all the medical officers have <lb/>
retired for the night, and silence and darkness have settled <lb/>
down on those miles of prostrate sick, she may be observed <lb/>
<pb n="93" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0106"/>
alone with a little lamp in her hand making her solitary <lb/>
rounds.&hellip; No one who has observed her fragile figure <lb/>
and delicate health can avoid misgivings lest these should <lb/>
fail. With the heart of a true woman and the manners <lb/>
of a lady, accomplished and refined beyond most of her <lb/>
sex, she combines a surprising calmness of judgment and <lb/>
promptitude and decision of character."</p>
<p>No one can wonder at the fears expressed in this letter <lb/>
who has read of Miss Nightingale's almost miraculous <lb/>
energy and power of work. When fresh detachments of <lb/>
the wounded were brought in, she had been known to <lb/>
stand for twenty hours, distributing stores, directing nurses, <lb/>
assisting at operations, and ministering to cholera and fever <lb/>
patients. "To see her pass was happiness," one poor fellow <lb/>
said. "As she passed down the beds she would nod to <lb/>
one and smile at many more; but she could not do it to <lb/>
all, you know. We lay there by hundreds; but we could <lb/>
kiss her shadow as it fell, and lay our heads upon the <lb/>
pillow again, content." What words could be more touching <lb/>
than those!</p>
<p>Mrs. Jamieson, in her "Sacred and Legendary Art," tells <lb/>
us "that at Pisa the Church of San Francesco contained a <lb/>
chapel dedicated lately to Santa Filomena; over the altar is <lb/>
a picture by Sabatelli, representing the saint as a beautiful <lb/>
nymph-like figure floating down from heaven, attended by <lb/>
two angels, bearing the lily, palm, and javelin, and beneath, <lb/>
in the foreground, the sick and maimed who are healed by <lb/>
her intercession."</p>
<p>Longfellow has beautifully embodied this legend in his <lb/>
poem on Florence Nightingale, when he writes: <lb/>
<q><lg type="stanza">

<p><hi rend="small-caps">But</hi>, in spite of the devotion of these ministering <lb/>
women, the winter of 1855 was a terrible one for <lb/>
the army, and the Queen's womanly heart was full of pity <lb/>
and sympathy for her suffering soldiers. A great deal of <lb/>
the mismanagement had been kept from her; but some <lb/>
rumours reached her at last, and on December 6th she <lb/>
wrote to her Secretary of War: "Would you tell Mrs. <lb/>
Herbert that I begged she would let me see frequently the <lb/>
accounts she receives from Miss Nightingale or Mrs. <reg orig="Brace-|bridge">Bracebridge</reg>, <lb/>
as I have no details of the wounded, though I see <lb/>
so many from officers, etc., about the battlefield, and <lb/>
naturally the former must interest me more than any one? <lb/>
Let Mrs. Herbert also know that I wish Miss Nightingale <lb/>
and the ladies would tell these poor, noble, wounded and <lb/>
sick men that no one takes a warmer interest, or feels more <lb/>
for their sufferings, or admires their courage and heroism <lb/>
more, than their Queen. Day and night she thinks of her <lb/>
<pb n="96" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0109"/>
beloved troops. So does the Prince. Beg Mrs. Herbert <lb/>
to communicate these my words to those ladies, as I know <lb/>
that our sympathy is much valued by these noble fellows."</p>
<p>And on February 23rd Mr. Bright said, in the House of <lb/>
Commons, "Thousands, scores of thousands of persons <lb/>
have retired to rest, night after night, whose slumbers have <lb/>
been disturbed, or whose dreams have been busied, with <lb/>
the sufferings and agonies of our soldiers in the Crimea."</p>
<p>What those hardships were Miss Nightingale herself <reg orig="in-|forms">informs</reg> <lb/>
us in a letter from Balaclava to a friend, in May 1855, <lb/>
found among the Prince Consort's papers. She writes: <lb/>
"Fancy working five nights out of seven in the trenches! <lb/>
Fancy being thirty-six hours in them at a stretch, as they <lb/>
were all December, lying down, or half lying down, after <lb/>
forty-eight hours, with no food but raw salt pork sprinkled <lb/>
with sugar, rum and biscuit; nothing hot, because the <lb/>
exhausted soldier could not collect his own fuel, as he was <lb/>
expected to do, to cook his own rations; and fancy through <lb/>
all this the army preserving their courage and patience as <lb/>
they have done, and being now eager&mdash;the old ones more <lb/>
than the young ones&mdash;to be led even into the trenches. <lb/>
There is something sublime in the spectacle."</p>
<p>Officers as well as the private soldiers suffered terrible <lb/>
hardships during that winter. We read in "Captain Hedley <lb/>
Vicars' Life" that his only bed at that time was made of <lb/>
stones and leaves, until a fur rug arrived from England; he <lb/>
even gave up his own tent to his men, and lay in the open <lb/>
air, considering himself more fit to rough it.</p>
<p>A further staff of fifty trained female nurses had been <lb/>
sent from England to help Miss Nightingale and assistants. <lb/>
There was plenty of work for all.</p>
<p>One can only imagine what privations and discomforts <lb/>
those devoted women had to undergo during those months <lb/>
of wearing fatigue and endurance, and it would be difficult <lb/>
to give any idea of their round of daily and nightly duties. <lb/>
<pb n="97" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0110"/>
They had to do everything for themselves as well as for <lb/>
the patients.</p>
<p>The authoress of "Eastern Hospitals and English Nurses" <lb/>
says: "Our life was a laborious one; we had to sweep our <lb/>
own room, make our bed, wash up our dishes, etc., and <lb/>
fetch our meals from the kitchen below. We went to our <lb/>
wards at nine, returned at two, went again at three &lpar;unless <lb/>
we went for a walk, which we had permission to do at this <lb/>
hour&rpar;, returned at half-past five to tea, then to the wards <lb/>
again till half-past nine, and often again for an hour to our <lb/>
special cases.&hellip; We suffered greatly from want of proper <lb/>
food. Our diet consisted of the coarse sour bread of the <lb/>
country, tea without milk, butter so rancid we could not <lb/>
touch it, and very bad meat and porter, and at night a glass <lb/>
of wine or brandy. It was an effort, even to those in health, <lb/>
to sit down to our meals; we forced the food down as a <lb/>
duty, but some of the ladies became so weak and ill they <lb/>
really could not touch it."</p>
<p>But a brighter passage occurs later on, when the writer, <lb/>
in glowing words, goes on to speak of the behaviour of the <lb/>
poor fellows to their nurses. "Our life," she says, "was <lb/>
a regular routine of work and rest &lpar;except on occasions of <lb/>
extraordinary pressure&rpar; following each other in order; but <lb/>
whether in the strain of overwork, or the steady fulfilment <lb/>
of our arduous duty, there was one bright ray ever shed <lb/>
over it, one thing that made labour light and sweet, and <lb/>
this was the respect, affection, and gratitude of the men; no <lb/>
words can tell it rightly, for it was unbounded, and as long <lb/>
as we stayed among them it never changed. Familiar as <lb/>
our presence became to them, though we were in and out <lb/>
of the wards day and night, they never forgot the respect <lb/>
due to our sex and position."</p>
<p>It is heartrending, but at the same time gratifying, to <lb/>
English hearts, to read in the pages of the Rev. Sydney <lb/>
Godolphin Osborne, of the patience and heroism of these <lb/>
<pb n="98" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0111"/>
poor wounded and dying men. In one strongly moving <lb/>
passage he says, while detailing the cruel neglect and <reg orig="miser-|able">miserable</reg> <lb/>
squalor of the scene of which we have been speaking: <lb/>
"I can with truth say, I was never called to one dying man <lb/>
who uttered a single murmur against those who thus treated <lb/>
him and his comrades. They were very fond of being read <lb/>
to, joined earnestly in prayer, were apparently very truthful <lb/>
in their answers as to their past lives &lpar;very many had run <lb/>
away from home and enlisted under false names&rpar;; few had <lb/>
I occasion to attend when dying who did not show the <lb/>
truest penitence.&hellip; I saw men, after years spent in their <lb/>
country's service, now far from the land of those they loved, <lb/>
worn out by the privations of war, endured, too, under all <lb/>
the aggravations of pestilence and neglect, lying on the <lb/>
clothes they had not changed for months, in wards <reg orig="pre-|senting">presenting</reg> <lb/>
every feature to depress and to annoy, but made <lb/>
more depressing and distressing by the dreadful <reg orig="death-|scenes">death-scenes</reg> <lb/>
of each day and night, yet listening with every <lb/>
symptom of grateful delight to the invitation, the promises of <lb/>
Him who left His home in heaven to contend to death for <lb/>
every penitent who would trust his soul to Him.</p>
<p>"They dictated calmly the plain, unboastful tale they <lb/>
wished written to the parent, wife, or other relative at <lb/>
home. It told of suffering without any complaint of it.&hellip; <lb/>
There was little else I could ever do for them; they said so, <lb/>
and gave a grateful pressure to the extended hand. In one <lb/>
instance a fine dying fellow kissed it, then, the God bless <lb/>
you, Sir."</p>
<p>The writer of this sketch cannot refrain from quoting on <lb/>
this subject the words of a Chelsea pensioner, an old <lb/>
Balaclava man &lpar;one of the few still living&rpar;, late <reg orig="Trumpet-|Major">Trumpet-Major</reg> <lb/>
of the gallant Scots Greys, in a letter recently <lb/>
received. The old veteran writes, "Relative to that honoured <lb/>
good angel, Miss Florence Nightingale: I was on duty <lb/>
as postman, as well as conductor of the band, and thus <lb/>
<pb n="99" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0112"/>
came personally in contact with that lady, as I had to go <lb/>
the rounds of both Upper and Lower Scutari Hospitals <lb/>
in order to deliver letters to my comrades; and Miss <lb/>
Nightingale would speak to me very kindly, in her loving, <lb/>
pathetic voice, and tell me of her poor sufferers, and how <lb/>
the familiar tune of 'Annie Laurie' and others, played by <lb/>
our band as we passed to and fro, would cheer and enliven <lb/>
them; and then she would ask me questions and give me <lb/>
news of my comrades. This she never failed to do till my <lb/>
regiment, or such of it as remained, left for England."</p>
<p>It was amongst these sad scenes that the lady-in-chief <lb/>
and her nurses worked, "the Rebeccas to the Ivanhoes <lb/>
of the Crimea." But it is strange and almost incredible <lb/>
that carping tongues and unkind criticism found fault even <lb/>
with this heroic and self-denying woman. Rev. Sydney <lb/>
Osborne speaks of this tone of depreciation with regard to <lb/>
the sick officers:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I heard a good deal of observation made on the spot, <lb/>
also since I came home, with regard to the fact that Miss <lb/>
Nightingale and the 'sisters' did not pay the same attention <lb/>
to the wards of the wounded and sick officers which was <lb/>
given to those of the soldiers. I believe, as the rule, Miss <lb/>
Nightingale did consider her own and the services of her <lb/>
'corps' confined, by previous understanding, to the soldiers <lb/>
only, though I have known her, on special request from a <lb/>
medical officer, cheerfully order small matters of extra diet <lb/>
for a wounded officer. I know Mrs. Bracebridge was most <lb/>
active and willing to forward everything which could be <lb/>
devised for the comfort of the officers, independent of any <lb/>
understanding which may have been come to previous to <lb/>
her leaving England &lpar;if any there was&rpar;. I can see myself a <lb/>
good deal of practical difficulty which would have arisen if <lb/>
she had taken any other course. I am satisfied she is not <lb/>
a person who would ever lightly put aside any means of <lb/>
rendering aid to those of her fellow-creatures she could <lb/>
<pb n="100" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0113"/>
assist; but I can conceive, with all that awaited her in the <lb/>
endeavour to introduce this new element of nursing by <lb/>
ladies amongst the common soldiers in a hospital, she might <lb/>
have urged very reasonable grounds for not also undertaking <lb/>
the same duty amongst the officers. If I am not <reg orig="mis-|informed">misinformed</reg>, <lb/>
since I left she has in more than one instance <lb/>
been of the utmost comfort and service at the dying beds of <lb/>
more than one officer of the establishment."</p>
<p>No worker in this world's history has been free from <lb/>
detractions, but one can hardly credit that there were <lb/>
tongues to find fault with this brave woman; but no such <lb/>
censure was passed by those amongst whom she worked. <lb/>
Kinglake tells us: "The magic of her power over men used <lb/>
often to be felt in the room&mdash;the dreaded, the blood-stained <lb/>
room&mdash;where 'operations' took place. There, perhaps, the <lb/>
maimed soldier, if not yet resigned to his fate, might at first <lb/>
be craving death rather than meet the knife of the surgeon; <lb/>
but when such a one looked and saw that the honoured <lb/>
Lady-in-chief was patiently standing by him and, with lips <lb/>
closely set and hands folded, decreeing herself to go through <lb/>
the pain of witnessing pain, he used to fall into the mood <lb/>
for obeying her silent command, and, finding strange support <lb/>
in her presence, bring himself to submit and endure."</p>
<p>But the voice of complaint was heard on another subject. <lb/>
Nolan informs us "that very warm discussions arose in <reg orig="con-|nection">connection</reg> <lb/>
with the religious views of Miss Nightingale and <lb/>
'the Sisters.'" While all admired their self-denial, there <lb/>
was a numerous class who supposed them to be influenced <lb/>
by what is called Puseyite opinion, in their zeal for spreading <lb/>
which in the army they were led to incur so many hardships, <lb/>
privations and risks. A lady under these apprehensions <lb/>
having written to Mrs. Herbert on the subject, received <lb/>
from her the following reply: "By this post I send you a <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Christian Times</hi> of Friday-week last, by which you may see <lb/>
how cruel and unjust are the reports you mention about <lb/>
<pb n="101" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0114"/>
Miss Nightingale and her noble work. Since then we have <lb/>
sent out forty-seven more nurses, of which I enclose you a <lb/>
list. It is melancholy to think that in Christian England <lb/>
no one can undertake anything without these most <reg orig="un-|charitable">uncharitable</reg> <lb/>
and sectarian attacks, and had you not told me <lb/>
so, I should not have believed that a clergyman of the <lb/>
Established Church could have been the mouthpiece of <lb/>
slander. Miss Nightingale is a member of the Established <lb/>
Church of England, and what is called Low Church. But <lb/>
ever since she went to Scutari her religious opinions and <lb/>
character have been assailed at all points. One person <lb/>
writes to upbraid us for having sent her, 'understanding she <lb/>
is an Unitarian'; another, 'that she is a Roman Catholic, <lb/>
and so on. It is a cruel return to make towards one to <lb/>
whom all England owes so much.</p>
<p>"As to the charge of no Protestant nurses being sent, <lb/>
the subjoined list will convince you of its fallacy. We <lb/>
made no distinction of creed; any one who was a good and <lb/>
skilful nurse, and understood the practice in surgical wards, <lb/>
was accepted, provided, of course, that we had their friends' <lb/>
consent, and that in other respects, as far as we could <lb/>
judge, they were of unexceptionable character. A large <lb/>
proportion of the wounded being Roman Catholic, we <lb/>
accepted the services of some of the Sisters of Charity front <lb/>
St. Stephen's Hospital, Dublin. I have now told you all <lb/>
and feel sure that you will do your utmost to set these facts <lb/>
plainly before those whose minds have been disquieted by <lb/>
these unfair and false accusations."</p>
<p>This letter, written in a spirit of womanly indignation, <lb/>
must have had its effect in silencing these unjust and absurd <lb/>
accusations. "The servant is not greater than his lord," <lb/>
said the Master. "If they have persecuted Me, they will <lb/>
also persecute you." And since these words were spoken <lb/>
by Divine lips, every worker in God's vineyard has, at some <lb/>
time or other, experienced their profound truth.</p>
<pb n="102" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0115"/>
<p>Many of the devoted nurses never returned to England, <lb/>
but lie in their quiet graves on the shores of the Bosphorus. <lb/>
In the spring of 1855, having completed her work of <lb/>
organisation at Scutari, Miss Nightingale went on a tour of <lb/>
inspection to the hospitals in the Crimea. The following <lb/>
little incident is told us by Mrs. Tooley. "One day, while <lb/>
about this work, she had occasion to go under fire; and <lb/>
when the men of the 93rd Regiment recognised in the <lb/>
slight lady clad in a black dress, walking with one of the <lb/>
officers, the 'Soldiers' Friend,' they sent up cheer after <lb/>
cheer, until the sound echoed in the caves of Inkermann <lb/>
and startled the Russians in Sebastopol." But the following <lb/>
passage is a sad one. "Not long afterwards, that same <lb/>
slight figure was carried on an ambulance by sad-eyed men <lb/>
up to the hut hospitals on the heights above Balaclava, and <lb/>
for many days Florence Nightingale lay between life and <lb/>
death, stricken down by the Crimean fever."</p>
<p>As soon as she recovered, Miss Nightingale refused to <lb/>
return home for rest and change, but insisted on resuming <lb/>
her work at Scutari. Twice afterwards she returned to the <lb/>
Crimea to carry out reforms in the hospitals there. It was <lb/>
not until 1856, when peace was concluded and the army <lb/>
was withdrawn from the Crimea, that Miss Nightingale <lb/>
returned to England. To avoid recognition and publicity <lb/>
she travelled under an assumed name, accompanied by a <lb/>
lady friend, and actually reached Lea Hurst without being <lb/>
recognised, and before her family knew that she had left <lb/>
Scutari.</p>
<p>The Queen had already sent Miss Nightingale an <reg orig="auto-|graph">autograph</reg> <lb/>
letter, with a jewelled Cross of St. George, inscribed <lb/>
in letters of gold with the words, "Blessed are the Merciful," <lb/>
and on her return she was summoned to Balmoral. On <lb/>
September 21st she was introduced to the Queen and the <lb/>
Prince Consort by Sir James Clark, with whom she was <lb/>
then staying at Birkhall. "She put before us," is the brief <lb/>
<pb n="103" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0116"/>
entry in the Prince's diary, "all the defects of our present <lb/>
military hospital system, and the reforms that are needed. <lb/>
We are much pleased with her. She is extremely modest."</p>
<p>About a fortnight later, we are told, Miss Nightingale <lb/>
became the Queen's guest, "the time of her visit being so <lb/>
fixed as to give Lord Panmure, who was then at Balmoral, <lb/>
an opportunity of learning from her own lips the story of <lb/>
what she had seen and the conclusions she had drawn from <lb/>
her great and remarkable experience in the East."</p>
<p>Florence Nightingale had evaded a public ovation on <lb/>
her return from Scutari, but the magnificent testimonial <lb/>
of fifty thousand pounds was presented by the nation and <lb/>
army, in recognition of her splendid services; but by her <lb/>
request this sum was devoted to the formation of a <reg orig="Train-|ing">Training</reg> <lb/>
Home for Nurses in connection with St. Thomas's <lb/>
Hospital. It is called "The Nightingale Home," and has <lb/>
a reputation worthy of its founder.</p>
<p>The fearful physical strain of those two years in the East <lb/>
on her already enfeebled condition, wrought permanent <lb/>
injury to her health, and since her return Miss Nightingale <lb/>
has spent her time in enforced retirement and in the <reg orig="in-|action">inaction</reg> <lb/>
of a sick room. We are told "that she sees only her <lb/>
nearest relatives and friends, and has scarcely strength to <lb/>
pen a letter; but the anniversary of a Crimean victory is <lb/>
never overlooked, and veterans who remain are sure of a <lb/>
message from 'the Soldiers' Friend.'" But from time to <lb/>
time, as strength permitted, there has been good work done <lb/>
in that quiet room.</p>
<p>In 1858 she published her valuable "Notes on Nursing," <lb/>
and the following year also "Notes on Hospitals," which, <lb/>
as we are told, "from their clearness of arrangement and <lb/>
minuteness of detail, are most valuable to the architect, the <lb/>
engineer, and the medical officer."</p>
<p>In the year 1863 was issued the Report of the <reg orig="Commis-|sion">Commission</reg> <lb/>
on the Sanitary Condition of the Army in India. These <lb/>
<pb n="104" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0117"/>
reports were sent in manuscript to Miss Nightingale, and at <lb/>
page 347 of vol. i. are inserted her incisive and admirable <lb/>
observations upon this immense mass of evidence.</p>
<p>In 1871 Miss Nightingale published "Notes on Lying-in <lb/>
Hospitals"; in 1873, "Life or Death in India," and &lpar;in <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Fraser's Magazine</hi>&rpar; "A Note of Interrogation," which <lb/>
attracted a good deal of attention, mainly on account of <lb/>
the way she handles religious beliefs and life.</p>
<p>From America and from European governments her <lb/>
advice has been sought as to army sanitation. She assisted <lb/>
in founding the Red Cross Society.</p>
<p>The "Notes on Nursing" is an extremely valuable <lb/>
pamphlet. It is not intended as a manual for nurses; but, <lb/>
in Miss Nightingale's own words, "They &lpar;the Notes&rpar; are <lb/>
meant simply to give hints for thought to women who have <lb/>
personal charge of the health of others. Every woman, or <lb/>
at least almost every woman, in England has, at one <lb/>
time or other of her life, charge of the personal health <lb/>
of somebody, whether child or invalid&mdash;in other words, <lb/>
every woman is a nurse."</p>
<p>These Nursing Notes are full of practical common sense, <lb/>
and should be in the hands of every mistress of a household. <lb/>
Some of these hints are epigrammatic in their conciseness. <lb/>
Two or three may be quoted.</p>
<p>"Everything you do in a patient's room, after he is <lb/>
'put up' for the night, increases tenfold the risk of his <lb/>
having a bad night; but if you rouse him up after he <lb/>
has fallen asleep, you do not risk, you secure him a bad <lb/>
night."</p>
<p>"Remember never to lean against, sit upon, or <reg orig="unneces-|sarily">unnecessarily</reg> <lb/>
shake the bed upon which a patient lies."</p>
<p>"Conciseness and decision are, above all things, <reg orig="neces-|sary">necessary</reg> <lb/>
with the sick.&hellip; Let your doubt be to yourself, your <lb/>
decision to them.&hellip; Irresolution is what all patients <lb/>
most dread."</p>
<pb n="105" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0118"/>
<p>"Above all, leave the sick room quietly, and come into <lb/>
it quietly; not suddenly, not with a rush."</p>
<p>"If there is some matter which must be read to a sick <lb/>
person, do it slowly."</p>
<p>"When a person is compelled, by the pressure of <reg orig="occu-|pation">occupation</reg>, <lb/>
to continue his business while sick, it ought to be a <lb/>
rule, <hi rend="italic">without any exception whatever</hi>, that no one shall bring <lb/>
business to him or talk to him while he is taking food, nor <lb/>
go on talking to him on interesting subjects up to the last <lb/>
moment before his meals, nor make an engagement with <lb/>
him immediately after, so that there be hurry of mind <lb/>
while taking them."</p>
<p>And in hints on sick diet it is a relief to know that Miss <lb/>
Nightingale does not disapprove of the favourite panacea of <lb/>
women, a cup of tea. "A great deal too much against <lb/>
tea is said by wise people," she observes; "and a great <lb/>
deal too much tea is given to the sick by foolish people. <lb/>
When you see the natural and almost universal craving in <lb/>
English sick for their 'tea,' you cannot but feel that Nature <lb/>
knows what she is about.&hellip; It is however certain that <lb/>
there is nothing yet discovered which is a substitute to the <lb/>
English patient for his cup of tea; he can take it when he <lb/>
can take nothing else, and he often will not take anything <lb/>
else if he has it not. I should be very glad if any of <lb/>
the abusers of tea would point out what to give to an <lb/>
English patient after a sleepless night instead of tea.&hellip; <lb/>
At the same time you should never give tea or coffee to the <lb/>
sick, as a rule, after five o'clock in the afternoon."</p>
<p>Another caution is given further on, which is put in <lb/>
rather an amusing way. "It seems a commonly received <lb/>
idea among men, and even among women themselves, <lb/>
that it requires nothing but a disappointment in love, the <lb/>
want of an object, a general disgust, or an incapacity for <lb/>
other things, to turn a woman into a good nurse. This <lb/>

<p>The first Home for District Nurses was opened at 37, <lb/>

Miss Nightingale, who had already made an urgent appeal <lb/>
for "The Founding of a Metropolitan and National <reg orig="Asso-|ciation">Association</reg> <lb/>
for providing Trained Nurses for the Sick Poor," <lb/>
took a great interest in this institution.</p>
<p>A Daughter of Santa Filomena, indeed! Well may the <lb/>

every English heart. In our generation there is no more <lb/>

"the Queen of Nurses, and the Soldiers' Friend."</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Augustus hare</hi>, in his delightful memorials of the <lb/>
Quaker family "The Gurneys of Earlham," has <lb/>
given us a charming description of the home where <lb/>
Elizabeth Fry, once Betsy Gurney, spent her girlhood. <lb/>
The picture is so ably drawn, that one seems to see it all <lb/>
plainly&mdash;"the little park that was scarcely more than a <lb/>
paddock," the oval drive with its quaint name "The World," <lb/>
the wide lawns and terraces, the gleaming river crossed by <lb/>
a bridge, the low hall, the sitting-room of the seven <lb/>
sisters, and that pleasant chamber called "Mrs. Catherine's <lb/>
Chamber," which the mother-sister occupied, and where, <lb/>
as he tells us, "in her old age, with her beautiful intonation <lb/>
and delicate sense of fitting emphasis, she would assemble <lb/>
the young Norwich clergy to teach them how the Scriptures <lb/>
should be fittingly read."</p>
<p>The Norfolk Gurneys claim their descent from the <lb/>
ancient barons of Gournay in Normandy, some of whom <lb/>
came over with William the Conqueror. This part of their <lb/>
history has been written by Daniel Gurney of Ructon. One <lb/>
of their ancestors, Sir John de Gurney, fought with Prince <lb/>
Edward in the Holy Land. Another, frequently mentioned <lb/>
<pb n="110" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0125"/>
in "Froissart's Chronicles," fought in all the great battles <lb/>
of Edward III. and the Black Prince.</p>
<p>From a younger son of the Gurneys of Barsham and <lb/>
Harpley came the family of Gurney which settled at <lb/>
Keswick in Norfolk, and embraced the tenets of the Society <lb/>
of Friends. John Gurney, the father of Elizabeth Fry, was <lb/>
a remarkably attractive young man; in 1773 he married <lb/>
Catherine, a younger daughter of Daniel Bell, of Stamford <lb/>
Hill. At the time of his marriage he carried on the <lb/>
business of a wool-stapler and spinner of worsted yarn; but <lb/>
in 1803 he and his brothers, Richard and Joseph, were <lb/>
admitted as partners in the Norwich bank by his cousin, <lb/>
Bartlett Gurney. Catherine Bell was a handsome brunette; <lb/>
and there is a delightful picture by Gainsborough, now <lb/>
in the possession of Mrs. Priscilla Wrightson, of the Old <lb/>
Hall, Hurworth-on-Tees, in which Catherine is delineated <lb/>
with her sister Priscilla and her brother-in-law, Edward <lb/>
Wakefield&mdash;Catherine in a brown gown, apron of clear <lb/>
muslin, and tan-coloured gloves, a graceful, sweet-looking <lb/>
maiden.</p>
<p>During the first years of their married life the young <lb/>
couple always resided in the winter in the old "Court-house" <lb/>
in Magdalen Street, which was convenient for its nearness <lb/>
to the woollen yarn factory. Here the six eldest children <lb/>
were born. Their summer home was a country cottage <lb/>
at Bramerton, standing on a well-wooded common, with <lb/>
a garden and cherry orchard; "indeed," Mrs. Fry afterwards <lb/>
said, "that the idea of Paradise and that garden were <lb/>
always one in her mind." The family was a large one; there <lb/>
were five sons and seven daughters. There is a quaint <lb/>
description given by Hannah Gurney in her old age, relating <lb/>
to the birth of the youngest boy.</p>
<p>"We, the younger girls, were spending the morning at the <lb/>
farther end of the kitchen garden, old nurse with us. Becky <lb/>
came to say a boy was born, and I remember the party of <lb/>
<pb n="111" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0126"/>
children allowed to go in to see the baby, holding on to <lb/>
each other's frocks in an orderly line. Not two years <lb/>
afterwards I remember them in a similar line walking past <lb/>
their dying mother."</p>
<p>Catherine Gurney seems to have been an excellent <lb/>
wife and mother. In a memorandum found after her <lb/>
death she lays down a brief rule of life: "First, to <lb/>
promote my duty to my Maker; secondly, my duty <lb/>
to my husband and children, relations, servants, and <lb/>
poor neighbours." She also notes in her journals "that <lb/>
in her daily walks with them she made a point of <lb/>
endeavouring to enjoy each individually." In one of her <lb/>
letters to her cousin Priscilla Hannah Gurney, she mentions <lb/>
her children, Elizabeth amongst them. "My dovelike Betsy <lb/>
scarcely ever offends, and is, in every sense of the word, <lb/>
truly engaging."</p>
<p>In 1786 John Gurney hired Earlham from its owner, <lb/>
Mr. Bacon Frank, of Campsall, in Yorkshire, as the family <lb/>
had outgrown the Bramerton cottage. Eventually he <lb/>
purchased a considerable estate at Earlham, on the opposite <lb/>
side of the road. This estate is still in the possession of <lb/>
his descendants, who may still be called the Gurneys of <lb/>
Earlham. John Gurney and his wife were not what was <lb/>
called "plain Quakers,"&mdash;they were intellectual, benevolent, <lb/>
and courteous; but though they attended First-Day meeting, <lb/>
"they did not adopt the strict garb of the Society, and <lb/>
their children studied music and dancing;" but those who <lb/>
shook their heads at the "worldliness" of the Gurneys, <lb/>
little dreamt of the remarkable lives that were being <lb/>
moulded under the Gurney roof. Elizabeth, "the dovelike <lb/>
Betsy," mentioned in the journal, idolised her mother. <lb/>
She seems to have been a shy, somewhat morbid child, <lb/>
possessing a poor opinion of her own merits. She says <lb/>
in her early recollections, "I believe I had a name only <lb/>
for being obstinate, for my nature had a strong tendency <lb/>
<pb n="112" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0127"/>
that way, and I was disposed to a spirit of contradiction, <lb/>
always ready to see things a little differently from <lb/>
others, and not willing to yield my sentiments to them." <lb/>
But in later years this spirit of contradiction was merged <lb/>
in that decision of character needed for her great work.</p>
<p>She was considered rather dull of intellect, and her health <lb/>
was delicate, but she was by no means deficient in <reg orig="penetra-|tion">penetration</reg> <lb/>
and common sense. She seems to have suffered <lb/>
greatly from nervous fear&mdash;she could not bear to be alone <lb/>
in the dark. And she was so devoted to her mother that <lb/>
she seldom left her side, and would watch her mother's <lb/>
slumbers almost breathlessly, fearing she would never wake. <lb/>
The death of that beloved mother, when Elizabeth was <lb/>
twelve years old, clouded the happy home at Earlham and <lb/>
brought bitter grief to her husband and children. With <lb/>
her dying breath she committed the care of the younger <lb/>
ones to her eldest daughter Catherine; her last articulate <lb/>
words were "Peace, sweet is peace!"</p>
<p>It was a strange and heavy responsibility for a girl of <lb/>
seventeen to be placed suddenly at the head of the <reg orig="house-|hold">household</reg>. <lb/>
There was no one to help her. Her father's only <lb/>
sister, Mrs. Barclay, lived too far away&mdash;indeed, she died <lb/>
the following year; but Hannah Judd, the housekeeper, and <lb/>
Sarah Williman, the devoted nurse, rendered her faithful <lb/>
service.</p>
<p>"Here, then, we were left," she wrote long afterwards; <lb/>
"I, not seventeen, as the head, wholly ignorant of common <lb/>
life, from the retirement in which we had been educated; <lb/>
quite unprepared for filling an important station, and <lb/>
unaccustomed to act on independent principles. Still, my <lb/>
father placed me naturally at the head of the family&mdash;a <lb/>
continual weight and pain which wore my health and <lb/>
spirits. I never again had the joy and glee of youth."</p>
<p>But, in spite of these sad words, Catherine Gurney seems <lb/>
to have done her part nobly. She directed her sisters' <lb/>
<pb n="113" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0128"/>
education, sympathized with them, and loved them. Her <lb/>
word was law; no one rebelled against "Kitty's advice," <lb/>
and all through her life she was a blessing to her family.</p>
<p>It is wonderfully interesting to read her account of her <lb/>
sisters in her old age. In speaking of Elizabeth, the third <lb/>
sister, she writes:</p>
<p>"She had more genius than any one from her retiring <lb/>
disposition gave her credit for in her early days. She <lb/>
had tender feelings, especially towards her parents, to <lb/>
whom she was the most loving and obedient of any of <lb/>
their children. She was gentle in look and manner, and <lb/>
pleasing in person; though she had not Rachel's glowing <lb/>
beauty, yet some thought her quite as attractive. She <lb/>
disliked learning languages, and was somewhat obstinate in <lb/>
her temper, except towards her mother. After we were <lb/>
left alone, her aversion to learning was a serious <reg orig="disadvan-|tage">disadvantage</reg> <lb/>
to her; and though she was quick in natural talent, <lb/>
her education was very imperfect and defective. Enterprise <lb/>
and benevolence were the two predominant features of her <lb/>
character, and wonderfully did these dispositions afterwards <lb/>
unfold under the influence of religion. In contemplating <lb/>
her remarkable and peculiar gifts, I am struck with the <lb/>
development of her character and the manner in which <lb/>
the qualities, considered faults when she was a child, became <lb/>
virtues, and proved in her case of the most important <lb/>
efficacy in her career of active service. Her natural <lb/>
timidity was, I think, in itself the means of acquiring the <lb/>
opposite virtue of courage, through the transforming power <lb/>
of Divine grace, which stamped this endowment in her <lb/>
with a holy moderation and nice discretion that never <lb/>
failed to direct it aright. Her natural obstinacy, the only <lb/>
failing in her temper as a child, became that finely-tempered <lb/>
decision and firmness which enabled her to execute her <lb/>
project for the good of others. What in childhood was <lb/>
something like cunning, ripened into the most uncommon <lb/>
<pb n="114" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0129"/>
penetration, long-sightedness, and skill in influencing the <lb/>
minds of others.&hellip; She was about seventeen, I believe, <lb/>
when the good impressions she had imbibed from her <lb/>
mother in her earliest years began to revive.&hellip; There <lb/>
was more timidity and scrupulousness in her early than in <lb/>
her mature religion, more of sectarian and peculiar view; <lb/>
but as her experimental knowledge of the Gospel advanced, <lb/>
her sympathies became enlarged, and the line into which <lb/>
she was drawn by her public engagements taught her in <lb/>
the most noble and catholic spirit to acknowledge the <lb/>
truth under every form and modification. She became a <lb/>
living illustration of St. Paul's description of charity, few <lb/>
seeming to partake so abundantly of the glorious liberty of <lb/>
the children of God."</p>
<p>This noble panegyric from Catherine Gurney's pen is <lb/>
worthy of being quoted in most of its fulness; every word <lb/>
speaks of the wise insight and knowledge of character of <lb/>
that loved mother-sister. It was a happy circle of bright <lb/>
young faces that gathered round Kitty when she read to <lb/>
them as they worked; and at other times she would join <lb/>
the games of hide-and-seek with the younger children "in <lb/>
the winding passages and eighty cupboards of the old <lb/>
house."</p>
<p>We have quaint but charming pictures of the fair <reg orig="sister-|hood">sisterhood</reg> <lb/>
scouring the country on their ponies in scarlet habits. <lb/>
"On one occasion it is recorded that the seven linked arms, <lb/>
drew a line across the road, and stopped the mail coach <lb/>
from ascending the neighbouring hill"&mdash;hardly Quakerlike <lb/>
behaviour.</p>
<p>Catherine, gentle as she was, shared her sisters' distaste <lb/>
to the Quaker Sundays; the long, dreary silence, and <lb/>
drearier sermons of the Meeting in Goat Lane. "Goat <lb/>
was dis." was often written in their journals, meaning "the <lb/>
Meeting was disgusting." Augustus Hare tells us that <lb/>
Betsy Gurney mentions a curious circumstance relating to <lb/>
<pb n="115" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0130"/>
her child life to Mr. Pitchford. "So much was she impressed <lb/>
with horror at reading of the sacrifice of Isaac, that she <lb/>
always dreaded to go to Meeting lest her parents should <lb/>
sacrifice her there."</p>
<p>As the sisters grew up, their charms attracted the young <lb/>
officers quartered at Norwich, who were also willing to <lb/>
enjoy the fishing and shooting at the Hall; and they had <lb/>
soon plenty of friends, among them a Roman Catholic <lb/>
surgeon settled at Norwich, John Pitchford, famed as a <lb/>
botanist, and his son John; the latter soon becoming very <lb/>
intimate with them, going almost daily to Earlham, singing, <lb/>
walking, boating, and playing cricket with the fair sisters, <lb/>
whom he termed "my seven most enchanting friends." <lb/>
Objections were raised by the Friends to this constant <lb/>
intercourse, and Mr. Gurney was obliged to beg him to <lb/>
relax his visits; but, after his marriage, he frequently <lb/>
walked over with his wife to Ham House, and was always <lb/>
welcomed by Samuel Gurney. John Pitchford had a great <lb/>
and very good influence over the minds of the sisters <lb/>
when the wave of infidelity, which came with the French <lb/>
Revolution, affected their young minds; "we elder sisters <lb/>
were ourselves in no small degree carried off our centre," <lb/>
writes Kitty, in her quaint phraseology. Their cousin, <lb/>
Mary Anne Galton, afterwards Mrs. Schimmelpenninck, was <lb/>
also much beloved by them; and Mrs. Opie, author of <lb/>
several pathetic novels, became intimate at Earlham, and <lb/>
would practise for hours with Rachel Gurney and her <lb/>
sisters.</p>
<p>Well might Miss Martineau speak of the Gurneys as "a <lb/>
set of dashing young people, dressing in gay riding-habits <lb/>
and scarlet boots." The little creatures, holding each other's <lb/>
frocks as they went in procession to see the baby brother, <lb/>
now sat in a row at "Goat's," in front of the gallery, in <lb/>
their gay attire. One memorable Sunday, February 4th, <lb/>
1778, when Betsy was in her twentieth year, they were all <lb/>
<pb n="116" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0131"/>
in their usual places, Betsy in a pair of new purple boots <lb/>
laced with scarlet. The American Friend, William Savery, <lb/>
was to preach. Richenda Gurney gives an account of this <lb/>
Sunday:</p>
<p>"His voice and manner were arresting," she wrote, "and <lb/>
we all liked the sound; but Betsy's attention became fixed, <lb/>
and at last I saw her begin to weep, and she became a <lb/>
good deal agitated. As soon as Meeting was over she <lb/>
made her way to the men's side of the Meeting, and having <lb/>
found my father, she asked him if she might dine at the <lb/>
Grove, our Uncle Joseph's, where William Savery was <lb/>
staying. He consented, though rather surprised at the <lb/>
request. The others went home as usual, and for a wonder <lb/>
we wished to go in the afternoon. As we returned in the <lb/>
carriage, Betsy sat in the middle, and astounded us all <lb/>
by weeping most of the way home. The next morning <lb/>
William Savery came to breakfast, and preached afterwards <lb/>
to our sister, prophesying a high and important calling into <lb/>
which she would be led. What she went through in her <lb/>
own mind I cannot say, but the results were most powerful <lb/>
and most evident. From that day her love of the world <lb/>
and of pleasure seemed gone."</p>
<p>Her own account is clothed in quaint phraseology: <lb/>
"To-day I have felt that there is a God. I have been <lb/>
devotional, and my mind has been led away from the follies <lb/>
that it is mostly wrapped in. We had much serious <reg orig="con-|versation">conversation</reg>; <lb/>
in short, what he said, and what I felt, was like <lb/>
a refreshing shower falling upon earth that had been dried <lb/>
for ages. It has not made me unhappy. I have felt ever <lb/>
since humble. I have longed for virtue. I hope to be truly <lb/>
virtuous, to let sophistry fly from my mind; not to be <lb/>
enthusiastic and foolish, but only to be so far religious as <lb/>
will lead to virtue. There seems nothing so little <reg orig="under-|stood">understood</reg> <lb/>
as religion."</p>
<p>From this time she began quietly withdrawing from the <lb/>
<pb n="117" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0132"/>
amusements and occupations of her sisters and leading <lb/>
a life apart. Catherine Gurney writes of her in her tender <lb/>
way: "I have a clear picture of Betsy's appearance at this <lb/>
time. It was peculiarly lovely.&hellip; When she told us she <lb/>
could not dance with us any more &lpar;which was at that time <lb/>
my greatest delight&rpar; it was almost more than I could bear, <lb/>
and I tried to argue with her, and begged and persecuted <lb/>
her. But it was all in vain.&hellip; The Bible became her <lb/>
study; visiting the poor&mdash;especially the sick&mdash;her great <lb/>
object.&hellip; Yet it was after she had received these <lb/>
powerful impressions that, with my father's consent, <lb/>
she went to London, literally to see the world, being <lb/>
determined to prove all things and hold fast that which <lb/>
was good."</p>
<p>So Elizabeth went under Mrs. Hanbury's care. She was <lb/>
taken to Drury Lane and Covent Garden Theatres; she <lb/>
saw <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Bluebeard</hi>, and other plays; but she <lb/>
could not enjoy them. She remarked in her droll way that <lb/>
when her hair was dressed "she felt like a monkey, and <lb/>
decided that London was not the place for heartful pleasure." <lb/>
Amongst the people she met were Amelia Opie, Mrs. <lb/>
Siddons, Mrs. Inchbald, and "Peter Pindar." As a result <lb/>
of this visit she determined to become a plain Quaker&mdash;to <lb/>
adopt the close cap and kerchief, to use "thee" and "thou." <lb/>
She also troubled her sisters by adopting Quaker <reg orig="pecu-|liarities">peculiarities</reg>; <lb/>
it is even said that she refused to see the picture <lb/>
Opie was painting of her father; but she afterwards <reg orig="eman-|cipated">emancipated</reg> <lb/>
herself from these useless restrictions. Her first <lb/>
good work was to open a small school for the poor children <lb/>
of Norwich, and in a short time she had about seventy <lb/>
scholars under her care.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1798 Mr. Gurney took his seven <lb/>
daughters for a tour through England and Wales. During <lb/>
this journey Elizabeth saw the aged Friend, Deborah <lb/>
Darley, who told her that she would be "a light to the <lb/>
<pb n="118" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0133"/>
blind, speech to the dumb, and feet to the lame." This <lb/>
prophecy greatly impressed the girl.</p>
<p>Amongst her brother John's schoolfellows at Wandsworth <lb/>
had been a boy named Joseph Fry; he belonged to an old <lb/>
family which took its name from Frie, in Normandy. Being <lb/>
afterwards placed with a "Friend," Robert Holmes, in <lb/>
Norfolk, to learn farming, he became acquainted with the <lb/>
Gurneys. His heart was soon won by Betsy. In an <lb/>
evening walk, as we read in Augustus Hare's "Memorials," <lb/>
he first became fully conscious of his feelings towards her. <lb/>
It is remembered that she was dressed that evening in a <lb/>
brown silk gown, with a black lace veil wound round her <lb/>
head like a turban, the ends pendant on one side of her <lb/>
face, and contrasting with her beautiful light brown hair." <lb/>
Very shortly afterwards the hair was hidden under the <lb/>
close cap of the plain Quakeress.</p>
<p>Joseph Fry's suit was not successful at first; when he <lb/>
proposed, Elizabeth refused him. He was supposed to <lb/>
be rich, and had a good house, was an excellent linguist <lb/>
and sang splendidly, bore a high character, belonged to the <lb/>
strict sect of "plain Quakers"; but his appearance and <lb/>
manners were against him. There is a curious story told of <lb/>
Joseph Fry's courtship: how he bought a handsome gold <lb/>
watch and chain and laid them on the garden seat, watched <lb/>
by six pairs of eyes&mdash;the six sisters hidden in six laurel <lb/>
bushes; and how the "tall, graceful Betsy"&mdash;her flaxen hair <lb/>
now hidden under a Quaker cap&mdash;shyly emerged upon the <lb/>
gravel walk. She seemed scarcely conscious of her <reg orig="sur-|roundings">surroundings</reg>, <lb/>
as if "on the wings of prayer she was being <lb/>
wafted into the unseen." &hellip; But though the watch <lb/>
remained on the garden seat, and Betsy in girlish scare <lb/>
fled back to the house, the loving spies remained in their <lb/>
laurel bushes. An hour later Betsy emerged again from the <lb/>
house, and slowly and tremblingly took up the watch. It is <lb/>
a satisfaction to know that she never repented this decision.</p>
<pb n="119" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0134"/>
<p>She was little more than twenty when she was married to <lb/>
Joseph Fry in the Friends' Meeting House, on August 19th, <lb/>
1800. It must have been a sore trial to the loving heart of <lb/>
Elizabeth to leave her dear home and its inmates, but she <lb/>
was promised long annual visits to Earlham, one or other <lb/>
sister would often be with her, and her young brother <lb/>
Samuel, a boy of fourteen, about to be articled to <lb/>
her husband&mdash;was to live under their roof. The future <lb/>
home was in St. Mildred's Court, in the heart of the city. <lb/>
The family into which she married was a Quaker family of <lb/>
the strictest order, and in spite of her orthodoxy she was, <lb/>
in the midst of the Frys, "the gay instead of the plain and <lb/>
scrupulous one of the family." Indeed, as Mr. Ingram tells <lb/>
us in his "Life of Elizabeth Fry," "for a little time she <lb/>
experienced some difficulty in reconciling her accustomed <lb/>
habits with the tenets of her husband's household and <lb/>
connections, but in the end succeeded."</p>
<p>Rachel and Hannah Gurney were at St. Mildred's Court <lb/>
when Elizabeth Fry's first child, Katherine, was born. <lb/>
A few weeks later the whole family assembled at the door <lb/>
of Earlham as a travelling carriage approached, containing <lb/>
the proud young mother and her babe, and her sisters <lb/>
Rachel and Hannah.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Fry had followed her chosen path during her <lb/>
young married life by ministering to the sick and poor <lb/>
among the slums of London. She visited them in their <lb/>
own homes. She also took interest in educational matters, <lb/>
and visited the workhouse and school belonging to the <lb/>
Society of Friends at Islington. On the death of her <lb/>
father-in-law, in the spring of 1808, the family removed from <lb/>
St. Mildred's Court to Plashet, in Essex. Writing of this <lb/>
pleasant change, Mrs. Fry says, "I do not think I have <lb/>
ever expressed the pleasure and enjoyment I find in a <lb/>
country life both for myself and the dear children. It has <lb/>
frequently led me to feel grateful for the numerous benefits <lb/>
<pb n="120" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0135"/>
conferred, and I have also desired that I may not rest in, <lb/>
nor too much depend on, any of these outward enjoyments. <lb/>
It is certainly to me a time of pleasure."</p>
<p>In the October of this year Mr. Gurney died at <reg orig="Earl-|ham">Earlham</reg>, <lb/>
from the effects of an operation. On hearing of his <lb/>
danger, Mrs. Fry hurried down to him. The whole family <lb/>
were together at the funeral, and it is worthy of note, that <lb/>
it was by this beloved parent's grave that Elizabeth gave <lb/>
public thanks for his merciful release; this being her <lb/>
first public appearance in the ministry. An eye-witness <lb/>
describes the scene: "Just before the first earth was thrown <lb/>
into the grave, Mrs. Fry threw herself forward into an <lb/>
attitude of prayer, and supported by her husband and <lb/>
sister, and almost choked by emotion, loudly prayed to <lb/>
be endued with thankfulness under affliction." From this <lb/>
day the Meeting of which she was a member acknowledged <lb/>
Mrs. Fry as a minister, and thus gave sanction to her <lb/>
speaking in their assemblies. She spoke at some of the <lb/>
meetings of the Norwich Auxiliary Bible Society. For <lb/>
some years the births of her numerous children, and the <lb/>
cares of a large household fully occupied Mrs. Fry, and <lb/>
prevented her from undertaking more public work. Her <lb/>
domestic duties were fulfilled with cheerfulness and <reg orig="con-|scientiousness">conscientiousness</reg>, <lb/>
and the revelations of her journal speak of <lb/>
her deep inward piety. In those years she had many cares <lb/>
and sorrows, frequent illnesses, the death of dear relatives, <lb/>
and the loss of one child, her tenderly beloved Betsy, a <lb/>
little creature of between four and five years. In later <lb/>
years other trials came to her. She had to bear the pain <lb/>
of seeing some of her children marry out of the Society <lb/>
of Friends, while losses in business involved a sad reduction <lb/>
in household comforts; but nothing could shake her <lb/>
serenity and calmness.</p>
<p>A short extract from her journal, penned in the first <lb/>
year of her married life, shows her self-discipline. This <lb/>
<pb n="121" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0136"/>
examination of conscience was carried on to the end of <lb/>
her life:&mdash;</p>
<p>"First. Hast thou this day been honest and true in <lb/>
performing thy duties towards thy Creator in the first place, <lb/>
and secondly to thy fellow-creatures, or hast thou been <lb/>
sophistical, and flinched? Second. Hast thou been vigilant <lb/>
in frequently pausing in the hurry and career of the day, to <lb/>
see who thou art endeavouring to serve&mdash;whether thy Maker <lb/>
or thyself? And every time that trial and temptation <lb/>
assailed thee, didst thou endeavour to look steadily at the <lb/>
Delivering Power, even to Christ, who can do all for thee? <lb/>
Third. Hast thou endeavoured to perform thy relative <lb/>
duties faithfully: been a tender, loving, yielding wife, where <lb/>
thy own will and pleasure were concerned; a tender, yet <lb/>
steady mother with thy children, making thyself quickly and <lb/>
strictly obeyed, but careful what thou requirest of them; <lb/>
a kind yet honest mistress, telling thy servants of their <lb/>
faults when thou thinkest it for their or thy good, but <lb/>
never unnecessarily worrying thyself or them about trifles; <lb/>
and to every one endeavouring to do as thou wouldst be <lb/>
done by?"</p>
<p>With such a mother Plashet House was the happiest of <lb/>
homes. Her daughter Rachel wrote a delightful description <lb/>
of it long afterward, from which we must quote:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Would that I could bring before you our mother," she <lb/>
wrote, "as she was when we first lived at Plashet! The <lb/>
gentle firmness of her rule; the sober gracefulness of her <lb/>
carriage; her exceeding love and tenderness towards her <lb/>
little children, especially during their infancy; the cheerful <lb/>
invigorating influence over us; her care of her domestics, <lb/>
mental and bodily; her systematic attention to the poor. <lb/>
There was our schoolroom, where we were under the kind <lb/>
governess, who laboured in succession with us all. Then <lb/>
our brothers set forth on their ponies to the Vicarage, <lb/>
whither for some time they went daily for instruction, and <lb/>
<pb n="122" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0137"/>
after that plan was abandoned, to their tutor, at the cottage <lb/>
at the end of the green walk. The nursery came next, <lb/>
controlled by those whom our mother had herself first <lb/>
taught and trained at Earlham, thus in the care taken of <lb/>
her children, and in their singularly happy childhood, <lb/>
reaping the fruits of her own early labours.</p>
<p>"Household matters, correct account-keeping, the <reg orig="over-|sight">oversight</reg> <lb/>
of Earlham School, regular visits to the poor, and social <lb/>
duties all followed in succession. Happy were we when <lb/>
summoned to accompany her into the village, but happier <lb/>
still if 'Irish Row' was to be our destination. Whether it <lb/>
was the noise and dirt and broad Irish accent, or the little <lb/>
ragged sunburnt children who crawled before the doors, I <lb/>
know not, but charming it certainly was.&hellip; By degrees our <lb/>
mother's influence amongst her poor Irish neighbours became <lb/>
apparent. The Roman Catholic priest was won over to many <lb/>
of her plans. Bibles were circulated freely, and several <lb/>
learned to read.&hellip; Another pleasure of those happy days <lb/>
was helping our mother to plant primroses and violets in the <lb/>
shrubberies and plantations of Plashet. Whether a cartload <lb/>
of roots had been brought from the forest, or some of her <lb/>
seedlings were ready for transplantation, the occasion was <lb/>
a joyful one for us. Our mother; Sally Allerton, whose <lb/>
Norfolk love of primroses almost equalled her own; Denis <lb/>
Regan, with his spade, basket, trowel and watering-pot, and <lb/>
our party was complete. Our mother's skilful though <reg orig="un-|cultivated">uncultivated</reg> <lb/>
touch in drawing added much to the pleasures of <lb/>
our winter evenings, providing us with little copies or <reg orig="sub-|jects">subjects</reg> <lb/>
of design, while our father read aloud. Then came <lb/>
the parting word, and with it the Bible and evening psalm <lb/>
before we separated."</p>
<p>This charming description gives us a vivid picture of that <lb/>
ideal home and its wise and gentle mistress. As her brother <lb/>
John once wrote: "After all, those loved my sister Elizabeth <lb/>
best who knew her most in her private life." And further on: <lb/>
<pb n="123" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0138"/>
"She was an ardent lover of the beauties of nature, and <lb/>
observed them with delight in their smaller as well as in <lb/>
their larger features: a shell by the seaside, a feather, or a <lb/>
plume would fill her heart with joy and tune her tongue to <lb/>
praise, while she gazed on it as an evidence of Divine <lb/>
wisdom, skill, and goodness." Near Plashet House stood <lb/>
Ham House, in the small park at Upton, where Mrs. Fry's <lb/>
brother Samuel lived. She was tenderly attached to him <lb/>
and his wife and family, and their near neighbourhood to <lb/>
Plashet was a great happiness to her.</p>
<p>Such was the home and environment of the future <lb/>
philanthropist. Doubtless this tranquil domestic life was not <lb/>
the life to which she had looked forward in her young zeal. <lb/>
Now and then, in her journal, there is a hint of regret for <lb/>
the years absorbed "in the duties of a careworn wife and <lb/>
mother." Nevertheless, that quiet waiting-time was not lost, <lb/>
it was training her for more active service. When the <lb/>
call came it found her ready. The time was now coming <lb/>
when the prophecy of the aged Deborah was to be fulfilled, <lb/>
when Elizabeth Fry was verily and indeed to be "a light to <lb/>
the blind, speech to the dumb, and feet to the lame."</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">It</hi> was in 1813 that Elizabeth Fry's attention was first <lb/>
called by William Foster to the condition of the female <lb/>
prisoners in Newgate. We read in both Mrs. Pittman's <lb/>
and Mr. Augustus Hare's account of this memorable visit, <lb/>
that "at that time all the female prisoners in Newgate were <lb/>
confined in that part afterwards known as 'the untried <lb/>
side.'" "The larger portion of the quadrangle was used as a <lb/>
State prison. The partition wall was not of sufficient height <lb/>
to prevent the State prisoners from overlooking the narrow <lb/>
yard and windows of the two wards and two cells of which <lb/>
the women's division consisted. These four rooms <reg orig="com-|prised">comprised</reg> <lb/>
about one hundred and ninety superficial yards, into <lb/>
which at this time nearly three hundred women, with their <lb/>
numerous children, were crowded, tried and untried, <reg orig="mis-|demeanants">misdemeanants</reg> <lb/>
and felons, without classification, without <reg orig="em-|ployment">employment</reg>, <lb/>
and with no other superintendence than that <lb/>
given by a man and his son, who had charge of them by <lb/>
night and by day. In the same rooms, in rags and dirt, <lb/>
destitute of sufficient clothing, sleeping without bedding on <lb/>
the floor, the boards of which were in part raised to supply <lb/>
a sort of pillow, they lived, cooked, and washed. With the <lb/>
<pb n="125" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0140"/>
proceeds of their clamorous begging when any stranger <lb/>
appeared amongst them, the prisoners purchased liquors <lb/>
from a regular tap in the prison; spirits were openly drunk, <lb/>
and the ear assailed by terrible language. Beyond that <lb/>
necessary for their safe custody, there was little restraint <lb/>
over their communication with the outside world."</p>
<p>This awful account was verified by other reliable <reg orig="wit-|nesses">witnesses</reg>. <lb/>
The Rev. C. B. Tayler wrote, that "Mr. Newman, <lb/>
the governor, entered that portion of the prison with <reg orig="reluct-|ance">reluctance</reg>; <lb/>
for half frenzied by the spirits which were openly <lb/>
drunk there, many of the depraved women took a pleasure <lb/>
in yelling, screaming, and using the most vile and terrible <lb/>
language. The governor advised Mrs. Fry and her <reg orig="com-|panion">companion</reg>, <lb/>
though without avail, to leave their watches in his <lb/>
house, lest they should be snatched from their sides, before <lb/>
he conducted them to that side of the prison."</p>
<p>It is almost inconceivable to realise that at the beginning <lb/>
of this nineteenth century, and in Christian England, such <lb/>
a pandemonium of squalor, disease, and vice should be <lb/>
suffered to exist; that this lazar-house of moral corruption <lb/>
should infect our English air. Some of these poor creatures <lb/>
were so brutalised and degraded that they were like savage <lb/>
beasts, and might have been seen yelling with fury and <lb/>
tearing off the caps of the other women in a rage that <lb/>
approached insanity.</p>
<p>When Elizabeth Fry paid her first visit to this hell upon <lb/>
earth, she was accompanied by Anna Buxton, the sister <lb/>
of Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton. In her journal she writes <lb/>
of these visits: "Yesterday we were some hours with the <lb/>
poor female felons, attending to their outward necessities. <lb/>
We had been twice previously. Before we went away dear <lb/>
Anna Buxton uttered a few words of supplication, and very <lb/>
unexpectedly to myself I did also. I heard weeping, and <lb/>
I thought they seemed much tendered &lpar;<hi rend="italic">i.e</hi>. softened&rpar;; a <lb/>
very solemn quiet was observed; it was a striking scene, <lb/>
<pb n="126" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0141"/>
the poor people on their knees round us in their very <lb/>
deplorable condition."</p>
<p>The revelations of the horrors that Mrs. Fry witnessed <lb/>
during these visits to Newgate stirred her very soul. She <lb/>
set her children at once to make green baize garments for <lb/>
the unfortunate creatures; but with her increasing family <lb/>
and many duties it was impossible for her to do more for <lb/>
the next few years.</p>
<p>In 1815 a great sorrow came to her. In the previous <lb/>
year she had lost her brother, John Gurney, and now her <lb/>
seventh child and special darling was to be taken from her.</p>
<p>All her love and sorrow and yearning found utterance in <lb/>
her journal: "It has pleased Almighty and Infinite Wisdom <lb/>
to take from us our most dear and tenderly beloved child, <lb/>
little Betsy, between four and five years old. In receiving <lb/>
her, as well as giving her back again, we have, I believe, <lb/>
been enabled to bless the Sacred Name. She was a very <lb/>
precious child, of much wisdom for her years, and I can <lb/>
hardly help believing, much grace.&hellip; She would often <lb/>
talk of 'Almighty God,' and almost everything had <reg orig="con-|nection">connection</reg> <lb/>
with Him on Third Day. After some suffering of <lb/>
body from great sickness she seemed wonderfully relieved <lb/>
&hellip; and began by telling me how many hymns and stories <lb/>
she knew, with her countenance greatly animated, a flush <lb/>
on her cheeks, her eyes very bright, and a smile of <reg orig="inex-|pressible">inexpressible</reg> <lb/>
content &hellip; Afterwards she told me one or two <lb/>
droll stories, and made clear and bright comments on them <lb/>
as she went along; then stopped a little while, and said in <lb/>
the fulness of her heart, and the joy of a little child &hellip; <lb/>
'Mamma, I love everybody better than myself, and I love <lb/>
thee better than anybody, and I love Almighty God much <lb/>
better than thee, and I hope thee loves Almighty God <lb/>
better than me.'&hellip; I appeared to satisfy her that it was <lb/>
so. This was on Third Day, and she was a corpse on <lb/>
Fifth Day evening.&hellip; I have been permitted to feel <reg orig="in-|expressible">inexpressible</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="127" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0142"/>
pangs at her loss, though at first it was so much <lb/>
like partaking with her in joy and glory, that I could not <lb/>
mourn if I would, only rejoice almost with joy unspeakable <lb/>
and full of glory. But a deep baptism was afterwards <lb/>
permitted me, like the enemy coming in like a flood; but <lb/>
even here a way of escape has been made, my supplication <lb/>
answered &hellip; and the bitter cup sweetened; but at others <lb/>
my loss has touched &lsqb;me&rsqb; in a manner almost inexpressible, <lb/>
to awake and find my much-loved little girl so totally fled <lb/>
from my view, so many pleasant pictures marred &hellip; My <lb/>
much-loved husband and I have drunk this cup together <lb/>

in close sympathy and unity of feeling."</p>
<p>This precious little child, this tenderly loved Betsy, <lb/>
was a sacred memory from that day, and Elizabeth Fry's <lb/>
thought often wandered to the little grave at Barking; <lb/>
but a new baby arrived six months after little Betsy's <lb/>
death to comfort the mother's heart. During these quiet, <lb/>
and on the whole prosperous years, there had been great <lb/>
changes in the old house at Earlham. Catherine, the <lb/>
mother-sister had joined the Church of England, and with <lb/>
her father's consent had been baptized at Barking Church <lb/>
two months before his death; three of her sisters, Richenda, <lb/>
Hannah, and Louisa, had followed her example. Priscilla, <lb/>
Samuel, and Joseph John Gurney, had became plain <lb/>
Quakers. Daniel and Rachel professed Quakerism in its <lb/>
mildest form. In 1817, when Elizabeth Fry was already <lb/>
engaged in her great life-work, all the different branches <lb/>
of the Gurney family had settled homes. Joseph, with the <lb/>
eldest sister Catherine, and the Quaker minister Priscilla, <lb/>
lived at Earlham; Samuel and his family at Ham House; <lb/>
Daniel and Rachel at Runcton; Richenda Cunningham <lb/>
and her clerical husband in their Vicarage of Pakefield; <lb/>
Hannah and Fowell Buxton in Brick Lane, near his <lb/>
brewery; Louisa Hoare and her family at the Hill House, <lb/>
Hampstead, which was their lifelong home, though they <lb/>
<pb n="128" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0143"/>
also owned Cliff House at Cromer. Katherine Fry wrote <lb/>
of them:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Thus, in the course of nature, the descendants of <lb/>
John Gurney of Earlham had branched off into distinct <lb/>
families, dwelling in their various homes, either in Norfolk <lb/>
or in the neighbourhood of London, differing in some <lb/>
respects, yet united by a common bond of strong family <lb/>
affection, tender sympathy, and unbroken harmony. Truly <lb/>
it might be said of them, 'if one member suffered all the <lb/>
members suffered with it.'"</p>
<p>The numerous cousins were brought up in great intimacy <lb/>
and unrestricted communication, although their parents <lb/>
did not belong to the same religious communities. About <lb/>
Christmas 1816, or January 1817, Elizabeth Fry commenced <lb/>
her work in the prison-house of Newgate. Startling public <lb/>
events had happened since her first visits. The Continent <lb/>
had been in a state of agitation and warfare. Napoleon <lb/>
the prisoner of Elba, had escaped, collected an army, and <lb/>
Waterloo had been fought. The disarmed tyrant was now at <lb/>
St. Helena, and a feeling of security pervaded the nations.</p>
<p>Still Newgate horrors prevailed, although in 1815 a <lb/>
deputation of the Gaol Committee of the Corporation of <lb/>
London had made a visit of inspection. A few <reg orig="improve-|ments">improvements</reg> <lb/>
were effected. "The sexes were separated, and the <lb/>
women provided with mats to sleep on; visitors were <lb/>
restrained from having much communication with the <lb/>
prisoners, a double row of gratings being placed between <lb/>
the criminals and those who came to see them. Across <lb/>
the space between the gratings it was a common practice <lb/>
for the prisoners to put wooden spoons fastened to long <lb/>
sticks, to receive the contribution of friends."</p>
<p>When Mrs. Fry commenced her systematic visiting at <lb/>
Newgate, she had eleven friends to help her. On her <lb/>
second visit she begged to be left alone with the women <lb/>
for some hours; and Augustus Hare tells us "that on that <lb/>
<pb n="129" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0144"/>
occasion she read them the parable of our Lord and the <lb/>
vineyard, and made a few observations on the eleventh <lb/>
hour, and on Christ having come to save sinners&mdash;even <lb/>
those who might be said to have wasted the greater part <lb/>
of their lives estranged from Him. Some asked who Christ <lb/>
was; others feared that their day of salvation was past." <lb/>
From the very first the tender motherly heart of Elizabeth <lb/>
Fry was filled with a deep pity for the miserable, puny and <lb/>
stunted children that pressed round her, half-naked, and <lb/>
pining for want of fresh air and proper food. She suggested <lb/>
to the women that a school should be formed for these <lb/>
neglected little creatures, and it was a proof that, even <lb/>
in their degradation, they were not wholly devoid of <lb/>
maternal feeling, when they eagerly assented to this <reg orig="pro-|position,&mdash;they">proposition,&mdash;they</reg> <lb/>
even shed tears of joy."</p>
<p>At Mrs. Fry's next visit she found they had already <lb/>
chosen a schoolmistress from among themselves, a young <lb/>
woman, Mary Connor, who, although fairly educated, had <lb/>
been committed for stealing a watch. We are told "that <lb/>
her conduct was so exemplary as a teacher, that Government <lb/>
granted her a free pardon, which she did not live long to <lb/>
enjoy." An empty cell was granted for the schoolroom, <lb/>
and crowded with the children. A young Friend named <lb/>
Mary Anderson came to assist, but was almost frightened <lb/>
away. She informed Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton of her <lb/>
experiences.</p>
<p>"The railing was crowded with half-naked women, <lb/>
struggling together for the front situation with the most <lb/>
boisterous violence, with the utmost vociferation," and she <lb/>
shuddered with apprehension when the door was shut and <lb/>
she was locked in with these desperate creatures. Even <lb/>
on this first day, the Rev. Thomas Timpson tells us, "the <lb/>
school surpassed their most sanguine expectations; their <lb/>
only pain arose from the numerous and pressing applications <lb/>
made by young women who longed to be taught and <lb/>
<pb n="130" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0145"/>
employed. The narrowness of the room rendered it <reg orig="im-|possible">impossible</reg> <lb/>
to yield to these requests, whilst a denial seemed <lb/>
a sentence of destruction, excluding every hope and almost <lb/>
every possibility of reformation&hellip;"</p>
<p>Mrs. Fry wrote: "I have been lately much occupied <lb/>
in forming a school in Newgate for the children of the <lb/>
poor prisoners, as well as the young criminals, which has <lb/>
brought much peace and satisfaction with it. But my mind <lb/>
has also been deeply affected in attending a poor woman <lb/>
who was executed, I suppose, this morning. I visited her <lb/>
twice. This event has brought me into deep feeling."</p>
<p>It was a severe strain on her nervous system to minister <lb/>
to women under sentence of death. "I have suffered much <lb/>
about the hanging of criminals," she wrote. And again: "I <lb/>
have just returned from a melancholy visit to Newgate, <lb/>
where I have been at the request of Elizabeth Fricker <reg orig="pre-|vious">previous</reg> <lb/>
to her execution to-morrow at eight o'clock. I found <lb/>
her much harried, distressed, and tormented in mind. Her <lb/>
hands were cold and covered with something like the <reg orig="per-|spiration">perspiration</reg> <lb/>
which precedes death, and in an universal tremor. <lb/>
The women who were with her said she had been so <reg orig="out-|rageous">outrageous</reg> <lb/>
before my going, that they thought a man must be <lb/>
sent for to manage her. However, after a serious time with <lb/>
her, her troubled soul became calm." With regard to this <lb/>
unfortunate woman, contemporary evidence raised very <lb/>
grave doubts whether she was guilty at all; the man <reg orig="con-|victed">convicted</reg> <lb/>
with her, on the day before his execution maintained <lb/>
her complete innocence, though he refused to give the name <lb/>
of the actual culprit.</p>
<p>Another entry in Mrs. Fry's journal draws a dark picture <lb/>
of the interior of Newgate. "Besides this young woman, <lb/>
there are also six men to be hanged, one of whom has a <lb/>
wife, also condemned, and seven young children. Since the <lb/>
awful report came down he has become quite mad from <lb/>
horror of mind, a strait waistcoat could not keep him <lb/>
<pb n="131" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0146"/>
within bounds; he had just bitten the turnkey. I saw the <lb/>
man come out with his hand bleeding as I passed the cell. <lb/>
I hear that another, who has been tolerably educated and <lb/>
brought up, was doing all he could to harden himself <lb/>
through unbelief, trying to convince himself that religious <lb/>
truths were idle tales."</p>
<p>Merrie England had its dark side. The records in John <lb/>
Howard's and Elizabeth Fry's journals tell of a terrible <lb/>
state of things. The laws were Draco-like in their pitiless <lb/>
severity, and were also written in blood. Light offences <lb/>
were punished with death. A man was not only hanged <lb/>
for stealing a sheep or passing one-pound forged notes, <lb/>
but even hunger-bitten creatures had been condemned for <lb/>
stealing a loaf of bread for themselves or their children. <lb/>
George Cruikshank, writing in 1876, among other things <lb/>
says: "Fifty-eight years back from this date there were <lb/>
one-pound Bank of England notes in circulation, and <reg orig="un-|fortunately">unfortunately</reg> <lb/>
many forged ones were in circulation also, and <lb/>
being passed, the punishment for which offence was in <lb/>
some cases transportation, in others death. At this period, <lb/>
having to go early to the Royal Exchange one morning, <lb/>
I passed Newgate, and saw several people suspended from <lb/>
the gibbet. <hi rend="italic">Two</hi> of them were women who had been <lb/>
executed for passing one-pound forged notes. I determined, <lb/>
if possible, to put a stop to such terrible punishment for <lb/>
such a crime, and made a sketch of the above note and <lb/>
then an etching of it."</p>
<p>From Mrs. Pittman's "Life of Elizabeth Fry," we find a <lb/>
mention of the "Black Act," first passed in the reign of <lb/>
George I., and enlarged by George II.; and from a table <lb/>
published by Janssen and quoted by Hepworth Dixon, in <lb/>
twenty-three years, from 1749 to 1771, eleven hundred and <lb/>
twenty-one persons were condemned to death in London <lb/>
alone. Of these six hundred and seventy-eight were actually <lb/>
hanged; the remainder either died in prison, were <reg orig="trans-|ported">transported</reg>, <lb/>
<pb n="132" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0147"/>
or pardoned. It is recorded, as one of these cases, <lb/>
that "a young woman with a babe at her breast was hanged <lb/>
for stealing from a shop a piece of cloth of the value of <lb/>
five shillings. The poor woman was the destitute wife of a <lb/>
young man whom the press-gang had captured and carried <lb/>
off to sea, leaving her and her babe to the mercy of the <lb/>
world. Utterly homeless and starving, she stole to buy <lb/>
food; but a grateful country requited the services of the <lb/>
sailor by hanging the wife."</p>
<p>And these were the good old days of Merrie England! <lb/>
No wonder humane people hesitated to prosecute. Mrs. <lb/>
Pittman tells us "that George III. kept a register of all <lb/>
cases of capital punishment," and "that it is said that he <lb/>
frequently rose from his couch at night to peruse this fatal <lb/>
list; and that he shut himself up closely in his private <lb/>
apartments during the hours appointed for the execution <lb/>
of criminals condemned to death."</p>
<p>Tyburn ceased to be the place of execution in 1783; <lb/>
from that year Newgate witnessed most of the horrors.</p>
<p>About this period of Elizabeth Fry's career philanthropists <lb/>
were taking steps to restrain the severity of the death <lb/>
penalty, the Gurney family, William Wilberforce, Sir James <lb/>
Macintosh and Sir Samuel Romilly among them. At a <lb/>
later date Joseph John Gurney wrote: "I cannot say that <lb/>
my spirit greatly revolts against life for life, though capital <lb/>
punishment for anything short of this appears to me to <lb/>
be execrable."</p>
<p>It must have been fearful work, and trying alike to <lb/>
strength and nerves, when this heroic but delicately nurtured <lb/>
woman began her saintly ministrations among the degraded <lb/>
creatures in that terrible prison-house of our Metropolis. <lb/>
What a change from Plashet House, with its gardens and <lb/>
meadows, the songs of birds and the sweet scent of flowers, <lb/>
to those grimy wards and their wretched inmates! In her <lb/>
evidence before the House of Commons Mrs. Fry said, <lb/>
<pb n="133" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0148"/>
"It was in our visits to the school, where some of us <lb/>
attended every day, that we were witnesses to the dreadful <lb/>
proceedings that went forward in the female part of the <lb/>
prison: the begging, swearing, gaming, fighting, dancing, <lb/>
dressing up in men's clothes, scenes too bad to be described, <lb/>
so that we did not think it suitable to admit young persons <lb/>
with us."</p>
<p>It was during these daily visits to the school for the <lb/>
children that these zealous workers began to realise more <lb/>
and more that much of the dissipation and licentiousness <lb/>
prevalent in the female wards of Newgate arose in a great <lb/>
measure from want of certain regulations, but chiefly from <lb/>
need of occupation. There, as in other places, "Satan <lb/>
found mischief still for idle hands to do." The women <lb/>
themselves were eager to be employed. In Mrs. Fry's <lb/>
own words: "I soon found that nothing could be done, <lb/>
or was worth attempting, for the reformation of the women <lb/>
without constant employment."</p>
<p>As this idea took possession of her mind, she and her <lb/>
helpers determined to project a school for the employment <lb/>
of the tried women, for teaching them to read and work.</p>
<p>Mr. Buxton gives a detailed account of this attempt:</p>
<p>"With these impressions," he writes, "they had the <lb/>
boldness to declare that if a committee could be found <lb/>
who would share the labour, and a matron who would <lb/>
engage never to leave the prison day or night, they <lb/>
would undertake to try the experiment; that is, they would <lb/>
find employment for the women, procure the necessary <lb/>
money, till the city could be induced to relieve them of <lb/>
the expense, and be answerable for the safety of the <reg orig="pro-|perty">property</reg> <lb/>
committed into the hands of the prisoners. This <lb/>
committee immediately presented itself: it consisted of the <lb/>
wife of a clergyman &lpar;Mrs. Anglezark&rpar; and eleven members <lb/>
of the Society of Friends. They professed their willingness <lb/>
to suspend every other engagement and avocation, and to <lb/>
<pb n="134" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0149"/>
devote themselves to Newgate; and, in truth, they have <lb/>
performed their promise."</p>
<p>A matron was found, and then, as Mr. Buxton informs <lb/>
us, Mrs. Fry had an interview in her husband's house with <lb/>
Mr. Cotton, the Ordinary, and Mr. Newman, the Governor, <lb/>
and laid her plans before them. Neither of the gentlemen <lb/>
were hopeful, but they promised their warm co-operation. <lb/>
She next had an interview with Mr. Bridges, the Sheriff, <lb/>
"from whom she asked nothing more at this time than a <lb/>
salary for the matron, a comfortable room for her and one <lb/>
for the committee." He told her that, although he wished <lb/>
to assist her, nothing could be done without the concurrence <lb/>
of the women themselves. Mrs. Fry replied to this: "Let <lb/>
the experiment be tried; let the women be assembled in <lb/>
your presence, and if they will not consent to the strict <lb/>
observance of our rules, let the project be dropped," and <lb/>
Mr. Bridges gave his assent to this.</p>
<p>The committee already formed for this great work was <lb/>
known as "An Association for the Improvement of the <lb/>
Female Prisoners in Newgate," and its object, as briefly <lb/>
stated in Mrs. Fry's journal, was "To provide for the <lb/>
clothing, instruction, and employment of women; to <reg orig="intro-|duce">introduce</reg> <lb/>
them to the knowledge of the Scriptures, and to <lb/>
form in them, as much as possible, those habits of sobriety, <lb/>
order, and industry, which may render them docile and <lb/>
peaceable whilst in prison, and respectable when they <lb/>
leave it."</p>
<p>Well might Mrs. Fry write, in this month of March 1817: <lb/>
"My mind is tossed by a variety of interests and duties.&hellip; <lb/>
I hope I am not undertaking too much. It is a little like <lb/>
being in the whirlwind and the storm; but may I be <lb/>
enabled quietly to perform that which ought to be done; <lb/>
and may all be done so heartily unto the Lord, and <lb/>
through the assistance of His grace, that, if it is consistent <lb/>
with His holy will, His blessing may attend it."</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">It</hi> was a strange sight that Sunday afternoon, and one <lb/>
never witnessed before in those dreary precincts, when <lb/>
the two Sheriffs, with Mr. Cotton and Mr. Newman, met <lb/>
the ladies at Newgate. Upwards of seventy women were <lb/>
present. Mrs. Fry read out several rules in her impressive <lb/>
way. "My mother had three great gifts," her daughter <lb/>
Katherine wrote: "her dignified and stately presence, her <lb/>
exquisite voice, and her constant and unruffled expression <lb/>
&mdash;the same to crowned heads and poor prisoners." The <lb/>
women assembled "unanimously and willingly engaged to <lb/>
be bound by these rules, which were as follows:</p>
<list>
<item>"1. That a woman be appointed for the general <reg orig="super-|vision">supervision</reg> <lb/>
of the women.</item>
<item>"2. That the women be engaged in needlework, knitting, <lb/>
or any other suitable employment.</item>
<item>"3. That there be no begging, swearing, gaming, <reg orig="card-|playing">card-playing</reg>, <lb/>
quarrelling, or universal conversation. That all <lb/>
novels, plays, and other improper books be excluded; that <lb/>
all bad words be avoided, and any default in these <reg orig="parti-|culars">particulars</reg> <lb/>
be reported to the matron."</item>
</list>
<p>The next five rules relate to the yard-keeper and <lb/>
<pb n="136" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0151"/>
monitors, one of which was to be appointed to each class <lb/>
of workwomen.</p>
<list>
<item>"9. That the monitors be particularly careful to see that <lb/>
women come with clean hands and faces to their work, and <lb/>
that they are quiet during their employment.</item>
<item>"10. That at the ringing of the bell at nine o'clock <lb/>
in the morning, the women collect in the work-room <lb/>
to hear a portion of Scripture read by one of the visitors <lb/>
or the matron, and that the monitors afterwards conduct <lb/>
the classes thence to their respective wards in an orderly <lb/>
manner.</item>
<item>"11. That the women be again collected for reading at <lb/>
six o'clock in the evening, when the work shall be given in <lb/>
charge to the matron by the monitors.</item>
<item>"12. That the matron keep an exact account of the work <lb/>
done by the women, and of their conduct."</item>
</list>
<p>To quote from Mrs. Pittman: "As these rules were read <lb/>
out the women were requested to raise their hands in token <lb/>
of assent. Not a hand but was held up. In just the same <lb/>
manner the names of the monitors were received, and the <lb/>
appointments ratified. After this business had been <reg orig="con-|cluded">concluded</reg>, <lb/>
one of the visitors read the twenty-first chapter of <lb/>
St. Matthew's Gospel; and then ensued a period of solemn <lb/>
silence, according to the custom of the Society of Friends. <lb/>
After that, the newly-elected monitors, at the head of their <lb/>
classes, withdrew to their wards.."</p>
<p>The work-room was an old disused laundry, repaired and <lb/>
whitewashed, and the next thing was to obtain a sufficiency <lb/>
of work and material. After the women were clothed, their <lb/>
work went to provide garments for the convicts at Botany <lb/>
Bay. "About six months after the establishment of the <lb/>
school for children, and the work-room for the tried side, <lb/>
the committee received a petition from the untried women <lb/>
begging for the same privileges. The experiment was tried <lb/>
in their case, but was not so entirely successful. The <lb/>
<pb n="137" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0152"/>
prisoners who expected speedy release were not so <reg orig="indus-|trious">industrious</reg> <lb/>
and painstaking."</p>
<p>When the ladies had worked their scheme for a month, <lb/>
they laid a petition before the Sheriffs, begging "that the <lb/>
newly-formed agency should be taken under the wing of the <lb/>
Corporation." The visiting officials sent in response to <lb/>
this appeal were so astonished at the transformation scene <lb/>
that they were ready to grant anything.</p>
<p>The school and manufactory were adopted as part of the <lb/>
prison system; a cell was granted to the ladies for refractory <lb/>
prisoners, with power to confine them for short intervals, <lb/>
and part of the matron's salary was paid out of the civic <lb/>
purse.</p>
<p>After this meeting of the authorities, Mrs. Fry made <lb/>
several suggestions for the prisoners' well-being, which were <lb/>
well received.</p>
<p>The labours of Elizabeth Fry and her helpers soon effected <lb/>
a change that was almost miraculous. Not only the visitors, <lb/>
but the prisoners themselves bore witness to their influence. <lb/>
"One woman in the infirmary, very near her end, said of the <lb/>
ladies, 'All the comforts round me, and all the consolations <lb/>
of my mind, are owing to them.'"</p>
<p>Another remarked of Mrs. Fry: "God bless her, and the <lb/>
day she came to Newgate; she has done us all good, and we <lb/>
have, and shall always have, reason to bless her."</p>
<p>In the Rev. Thomas Timpson's record we read that "the <lb/>
effect wrought by the advice and admonitions of the ladies <lb/>
may, perhaps, be evinced more forcibly by a single and <lb/>
slight occurrence than by any description. It was a practice <lb/>
of immemorial usage for convicts, on the night preceding <lb/>
their departure for Botany Bay, to pull down and break <lb/>
everything breakable within their part of the prison, and to <lb/>
go off shouting, with the most hardened effrontery. When <lb/>
the period approached for a late clearance, every one <reg orig="con-|nected">connected</reg> <lb/>
with the prison dreaded this night of disturbance <lb/>
<pb n="138" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0153"/>
and devastation. To the surprise of the oldest turnkey, <lb/>
no noise was heard, not a window was intentionally broken. <lb/>
They took an affectionate leave of their companions, and <lb/>
expressed the utmost gratitude to their benefactors; the <lb/>
next day they entered their conveyances without any tumult, <lb/>
and their departure, in the tears that were shed and the <lb/>
mournful decorum that was observed, resembled a funeral <lb/>
procession; and so orderly was their behaviour that it was <lb/>
deemed unnecessary to send more than half the usual <lb/>
escort."</p>
<p>Later on he remarks, "The women have made upwards <lb/>
of twenty thousand articles of dress, not one of which has <lb/>
been lost or stolen!"</p>
<p>Augustus Hare, in his memorial, quotes two accounts <lb/>
by eyewitnesses. One of the visitors gives his description <lb/>
as follows: "I obtained permission to see Mrs. Fry, and <lb/>
was taken to the entrance of the women's ward. On my <lb/>
approach no loud or angry voices indicated that I was about <lb/>
to enter a place which had long been known as a 'hell <lb/>
above ground.' &hellip; I was conducted by a decently dressed <lb/>
person, the newly-appointed yardswoman, to the door of a <lb/>
ward, where, at the head of a long table, sat a lady belonging <lb/>
to the Society of Friends. She was reading aloud to sixteen <lb/>
women prisoners who were engaged in needlework round it. <lb/>
Each wore a clean-looking blue apron and bib, with a ticket <lb/>
having a number on it suspended from their necks by a red <lb/>
tape. They all rose at my entrance, curtsied respectfully, <lb/>
and then, at a given signal, resumed their seats and <reg orig="employ-|ments.&hellip;">employments.&hellip;</reg> <lb/>
I afterwards visited the other wards, which <lb/>
were counterparts of the first."</p>
<p>There is also a quotation from the Rev. C. B. Tayler's <lb/>
"Personal Recollections." He says: "I accompanied Mrs. <lb/>
Fry on two occasions to Newgate, and I was present when <lb/>
she read a portion of the Word of God to the women in the <lb/>
room which was then appropriated to that purpose.&hellip; It <lb/>
<pb n="139" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0154"/>
was indeed a shocking and most distressing spectacle, that <lb/>
range of about a hundred women's faces with the various <lb/>
types of vice and crime written on the lines of almost every <lb/>
one. But there they sat in respectful silence, every eye <lb/>
fixed upon the grave, sweet countenance of the gentle lady <lb/>
who was about to address them. A table was before her, <lb/>
on which lay the Holy Bible. She seated herself in the <lb/>
chair placed for her, and after a pause for silent prayer of <lb/>
some minutes, she quietly opened the inspired volume. <lb/>
She turned to the Prophet Isaiah, and read aloud the <reg orig="fifty-|third">fifty-third</reg> <lb/>
chapter.&hellip; Never till then, and never since then, <lb/>
have I heard any one read as Elizabeth Fry read that chapter <lb/>
&mdash;the solemn reverence of her manner, the articulation, so <lb/>
exquisitely modulated, so distinct that not a word of that <lb/>
sweet and touching voice could fail to be heard."</p>
<p>It was not long before public attention was called to Mrs. <lb/>
Fry's work. Newspapers began to notice it; but her noble <lb/>
and retiring nature shrank from publicity and fame. On <lb/>
February 27th, 1818, Mrs. Fry was examined by a <reg orig="Com-|mittee">Committee</reg> <lb/>
of the House of Commons; and her clear, concise <lb/>
statement, made without exaggeration, gave a straightforward <lb/>
story of her efforts to lessen the misery of the female <lb/>
prisoners. In this year Mrs. Fry, by royal desire, was <lb/>
invited to meet Queen Charlotte at the Mansion House. <lb/>
It must have been a curious sight: the Queen, now aged <lb/>
and infirm, her small figure blazing with diamonds, and the <lb/>
tall, stately Quakeress, a little flushed, but still calm in look <lb/>
and manner. Katherine Fry, writing to her aunt, Mrs. <lb/>
Buxton, gave a graphic account of this interesting interview. <lb/>
"The Bishop of Gloucester &lpar;Ryder&rpar;, in lawn sleeves, <lb/>
leading our darling mother, in her plain Friends' cap, one of <lb/>
the light scarf cloaks worn by plain Friends, and a dark silk <lb/>
gown. I see her now: her light flaxen hair, a little flush on <lb/>
her face from the noise and bustle she passed through, and <lb/>
her sweet, lovely, placid smile.&hellip; When Queen Charlotte <lb/>
<pb n="140" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0155"/>
rose to go she paused, and passed to the side where the <lb/>
Bishops sat. Of course all had risen, and Lady Harcourt <lb/>
presented our mother. The Queen, who is so short, <lb/>
curtseying, and our mother, who is so tall, not curtseying, <lb/>
was very awkward. Her Majesty asked our mother if she <lb/>
were not afraid of going into prisons, how far she lived from <lb/>
London, how many children she had, etc. The shouts in <lb/>
the hall were tremendous, and were caught up by the <lb/>
crowds outside. It was told why they shouted, and it was <lb/>
repeated again and again, till it reached our father, sitting <lb/>
in his office at St. Mildred's Court, that 'the Queen was <lb/>
speaking to Mrs. Fry.'" This was almost, if not quite, the <lb/>
aged Queen's last public appearance; she soon afterwards <lb/>
passed to her rest. In this year Mrs. Fry inspected the <lb/>
prisons in Scotland.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1821 Mrs. Fry was called to her sister <lb/>
Priscilla's deathbed. For some months she had been slowly <lb/>
sinking in gradual decline. Mrs. Fry says: "We were all <lb/>
by her when her prepared spirit left the body, and a sweet <lb/>
time it was." And a relative who was present wrote to <lb/>
one of Mrs. Fry's daughters: "I can never lose sight of <lb/>
that group; the cluster of sisters, the perfect stillness, the <lb/>
sacred and assured peace. Not a sob reached the ear, but <lb/>
exquisite tenderness pervaded the whole. Your mother <lb/>
prayed, returned thanks to the Saviour, and committed her <lb/>
dying sister, and then the family, fervently and unreservedly, <lb/>
into God's keeping."</p>
<p>Meanwhile the ladies continued their good work; prison <lb/>
visiting and prison reform became the order of the day. <lb/>
Capital punishment engaged the attention of Mrs. Fry. <lb/>
She also, in addition to her prison labours, interested herself <lb/>
in the embarkation of the female convicts for New South <lb/>
Wales. In Mrs. Pittman's "Records" we are informed of <lb/>
the terrible and degrading manner in which the journey was <lb/>
performed. The women were conveyed in open waggons <lb/>
<pb n="141" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0156"/>
to Deptford, some of them laden with chains, others chained <lb/>
by twos; a shouting crowd followed the waggons. Mrs. <lb/>
Fry induced the governor to engage hackney coaches; she <lb/>
promised that their behaviour should be orderly, and that <lb/>
she and a few other ladies would accompany them to the <lb/>
ship. The first batch consisted of 120 convicts. As soon <lb/>
as they had reached the ship they were herded together <lb/>
below deck like cattle; and hitherto the miserable creatures <lb/>
had had nothing to do but curse, swear, and fight, and <lb/>
recount past tales of evil. The first arrangement was to <lb/>
provide work and knitting for them. The ladies had heard <lb/>
that patchwork and fancy work found a great sale in New <lb/>
South Wales, so they furnished the women with proper <lb/>
materials that had been sent to them from wholesale houses. <lb/>
Provision was also made for instruction for the children who <lb/>
were allowed to accompany their mothers, and a small space <lb/>
set apart in the stern for a schoolroom.</p>
<p>When the moment arrived for the departure of the vessel, <lb/>
Mrs. Fry read some passages from her pocket Bible, then <lb/>
kneeling down, commended the sobbing women to God's <lb/>
mercy. Her thoughts followed the poor exiles with deep <lb/>
anxiety, for she knew well what temptations awaited them <lb/>
on landing, "and how they would be without shelter, <reg orig="with-|out">without</reg> <lb/>
resources, and without protection; a small amount of <lb/>
provision would be allotted them daily, but no place to <lb/>
sleep in." This sad question was in due time ventilated, <lb/>
and necessary reforms were effected.</p>
<p>Mrs. Fry continued her exertions for the convicts on the <lb/>
transports; she also visited the floating prisons. We are <lb/>
informed that "the Newgate women were commended for <lb/>
their good conduct on the voyage," and in 1820 we find <lb/>
a building for the women in New South Wales was begun. <lb/>
"Every year," Mrs. Pittman writes, "four, five, or six <lb/>
convict ships went out to the colonies of Australia with <lb/>
their burdens of sin, sorrow and guilt. Van Diemen's <lb/>
<pb n="142" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0157"/>
Land and New South Wales received annual fresh <reg orig="consign-|ments">consignments</reg> <lb/>
of the outcast iniquity of the Old World. Mrs. Fry <lb/>
made a point of visiting each ship before it sailed as many <lb/>
times as her numerous duties permitted, and bade the <lb/>
convicts most affectionate and anxious farewells." With <lb/>
modest thankfulness she herself records long afterwards: <lb/>
"Surely the result of our labours has hitherto been beyond <lb/>
our most sanguine expectations, as to the improved state of <lb/>
our prisons, female convict ships, and the convicts in New <lb/>
South Wales."</p>
<p>In 1823 Mrs. Fry's eleventh and youngest child was <lb/>
born, on the same day with her eldest grandchild. An <lb/>
entry in her Journal, quoted by Augustus Hare, says: "We <lb/>
are going on comfortably, my darling baby an object of <lb/>
interest. I am once more moderately launched in public <lb/>
as well as private life, and am therefore much engaged, <lb/>
but not overdone. There has been a feeling of peace in <lb/>
entering meetings and the prison cause again, as if the <lb/>
calling to these things were continued. How I desire a <lb/>
simple, faithful, watchful walking, with my eye single to <lb/>
the Lord!"</p>
<p>With her elder children Mrs. Fry began to feel little <lb/>
differences of religious opinion. Her husband's love of <lb/>
music troubled her. As secular music was banished from <lb/>
Plashet House, he sometimes enjoyed it at concerts; <lb/>
but she endeavoured to forget her anxieties in her good <lb/>
works. It would be difficult to enumerate these. The <lb/>
establishment of nurses for the sick poor, the first system <lb/>
of district visiting, societies for prison visitings, libraries for <lb/>
the coastguards, reformatory schools for youthful offenders, <lb/>
were among her plans. Well might she say, "I am sensible <lb/>
of being at times pressed beyond my strength of body <lb/>
and mind." Her life has been compared "to an <reg orig="ever-|widening">ever-widening</reg> <lb/>
stream, growing wider and broader in its channels." <lb/>
From time to time she visited prisons at Nottingham, <lb/>
<pb n="143" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0158"/>
Lincoln, Wakefield, Leeds, Doncaster, Sheffield, York, <lb/>
Durham, Newcastle, Carlisle, Lancaster, Liverpool, and <lb/>
most other towns in England, and also those of Scotland <lb/>
and Ireland. Mrs. Fry was for some time at Brighton <lb/>
in 1824, and interested herself in the coastguard men&mdash; <lb/>
"Blockade men" as they were then called.</p>
<p>A pleasant summer retreat had been found by her in <lb/>
two cottages at Dagenham, above the Thames&mdash;a place <lb/>
very difficult of access. Here she could enjoy "the <lb/>
glorious sunsets, the shipping on the river, the watery <lb/>
sounds, the freshness of the air, the happy groups of <lb/>
children."</p>
<p>There is little doubt that her ministerial duties at times <lb/>
weighed heavily on the soul of Elizabeth Fry. In 1825 <lb/>
she made a ministerial tour in the West of England. Her <lb/>
journal abounds with passages that speak of inward <lb/>
conflict and sad trepidation. Once in near prospect of <lb/>
a meeting she writes: "In a remarkable degree it has <lb/>
plunged me into the depths and into real distress. I feel <lb/>
so unfit, so unworthy, so perplexed, so fearful, even so <lb/>
sorrowful, so tempted to mistrustful thoughts, ready to say, <lb/>
'Can such an one be called to such a service?'" And <lb/>
again: "The awful and buffeted state of my mind was in <lb/>
a degree calmed as the day advanced.&hellip; I felt helped <lb/>
every way; the very spirit and power seemed near; and <lb/>
when I rose from my knees I could in faith leave it all <lb/>
to Him who can alone prosper His own work."</p>
<p>The commercial troubles of 1826, and the failures of <lb/>
many banks and houses of business, caused much anxiety <lb/>
in the Gurney family. In the following year Elizabeth Fry <lb/>
had a fresh sorrow in the death of her sister Rachel. <lb/>
During her illness Rachel writes: "Catherine is my <reg orig="con-|stant">constant</reg> <lb/>
comfort, Betsy is my greatest treat."</p>
<p>In the account of her death-bed Richenda narrates: <lb/>
"After a few moments of solemn stillness, broken only by <lb/>
<pb n="144" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0159"/>
sobs, Betsy, with her own elevated spirit, poured forth her <lb/>
thanksgiving that the work was finished, the conflict over, <lb/>
and that this most beloved sister, companion and friend, <lb/>
was accepted in the Beloved; and had entered her <reg orig="ever-|lasting">everlasting</reg> <lb/>
rest to join in the song of the Lamb for ever."</p>
<p>There is something peculiarly touching in this family <lb/>
union. Sorrow only drew them more closely together. As <lb/>
Elizabeth Fry herself writes: "Amongst the many blessings <lb/>
still remaining to me, the brothers and sisters that I yet <lb/>
have are amongst the greatest."</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">In</hi> 1828 Mrs. Fry's daughter Richenda married Foster <lb/>
Reynolds, of Carshalton House. As he was a Friend, <lb/>
the wedding was at the Meeting-House at Plaistow. None <lb/>
of her other daughters married Friends. It was a happy <lb/>
day to Elizabeth Fry, but she spoke some significant words <lb/>
that seemed almost prophetical. "I have noticed that <lb/>
when great outward prosperity is given us, it is often the <lb/>
precursor of great trials."</p>
<p>Shortly after this joyful event, the failure of a house of <lb/>
business in which her husband was partner involved the <lb/>
Fry family in pecuniary troubles; they were obliged to <lb/>
leave their beloved home of Plashet, and to take refuge <lb/>
for a time with the married son at St. Mildred's Court, <lb/>
where Mrs. Fry's early married life had been spent.</p>
<p>Mrs. Fry felt this trouble deeply. We are told in <lb/>
Mrs. Pittman's narrative, that it seemed impossible to her <lb/>
upright spirit to face the usual Meeting on First Day. <lb/>
"Her sensitive spirit winced acutely at the reproach that <lb/>
might perchance be cast upon the name of religion; but <lb/>
after a prayerful pause she and her husband went &lpar;to Meeting&rpar; <lb/>
<pb n="146" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0161"/>
accompanied by their children, at least such of them as <lb/>
were at home. She occupied her usual place in the Meeting, <lb/>
but the big tears rolling down her face in quick succession <lb/>
testified to the sorrow and anguish which then became <lb/>
her lot. Yet before the service ended, she rose, calmed <lb/>
herself, and spoke most thrillingly from the words, 'Though <lb/>
He slay me, yet will I trust in Him,' while the listeners <lb/>
manifested their sympathy by tears and words of sorrow."</p>
<p>And in a letter to her daughter Rachel Cresswell she <lb/>
writes: "This is, I consider, one of the deepest trials to <lb/>
which we are liable; its perplexities are so great and <lb/>
numerous, its mortifications and humiliations so abounding, <lb/>
and its sorrows so deep.&hellip; I frequently find my mind <lb/>
in a degree sheathed against the deep sorrows, and am <lb/>
enabled not to look so much at them; but there are also <lb/>
times when secondary things arise, such as parting with <lb/>
servants, schools, the poor round us, and our dear <lb/>
home.&hellip; All our children and children-in-law, my brothers <lb/>
and sisters, our many friends and servants, have been a <lb/>
strong consolation to me."</p>
<p>When matters improved a little the Frys were able to <lb/>
take a small house in Upton Lane, near their former home, <lb/>
and close to Ham House, where her brother Samuel lived; <lb/>
here Mrs. Fry had the pleasure of possessing a small <lb/>
garden.</p>
<p>In 1831 there is a very interesting account in her <lb/>
Journal of a visit paid to the Duchess of Kent and <lb/>
her daughter the Princess Victoria. "I also ventured to <lb/>
remind her" &lpar;the Princess&rpar;, she wrote, "of King Josiah, <lb/>
who begun to reign at eight years old, and 'did that which <lb/>
was right in the sight of the Lord, turning neither to the <lb/>
right hand nor to the left,' which seemed to be well <lb/>
received.&hellip; I had long felt an inclination to see the <lb/>
young Princess, and think her a sweet, lovely, and hopeful <lb/>
child." She also had an interview with the amiable Queen <lb/>
<pb n="147" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0162"/>
Adelaide. Another daughter was married in 1832, leaving <lb/>
only two to share their parents' home in Upton Lane.</p>
<p>In 1833 Mrs. Fry paid an interesting visit to the Channel <lb/>
Islands, and inspected the prisons and hospitals; she <lb/>
revisited them also in 1836. Her first visit was curtailed <lb/>
by the serious illness of her sister Louisa Hoare, who <lb/>
shortly afterwards died at the Hill House, Hampstead.</p>
<p>The following month Mrs. Fry received news of a serious <lb/>
carriage accident happening to her husband and daughter <lb/>
Katherine while travelling in Normandy. She hastened <lb/>
to them, and on their recovery she paid a great many <lb/>
visits to the prisons and charitable institutions.</p>
<p>In 1836 Elizabeth Fry left England with her husband <lb/>
and their friends Josiah Fowler and Lydia Irving, for a <lb/>
religious tour through France. We read "that among the <lb/>
prisons visited were the St. Lazare Prison for women, <lb/>
La Force Prison for men, the Central Prison, and the <lb/>
Conciergerie." Mrs. Fry could not speak much French, <lb/>
but some friend always interpreted for her. She also <lb/>
visited the Hospital of St. Louis for the plague, leprosy and <lb/>
other infectious disorders, the Hospice de la Maternit&eacute;, and <lb/>
the Hospice des Enfans Trouv&eacute;s. The Archbishop of <lb/>
Paris was somewhat annoyed with her proceedings, but chiefly <lb/>
with her practice of distributing the Scriptures, not with <lb/>
her prison work.</p>
<p>As life went on Elizabeth Fry's zeal for good work seemed <lb/>
to increase; the state of the Continental prisons began to <lb/>
occupy her attention, and early in 1840 she started with <lb/>
her brother Samuel Gurney, his wife and daughter, and <lb/>
three other Friends, to visit the prisons of Belgium, Holland, <lb/>
and Germany.</p>
<p>At Brussels they had an audience of the King. At <lb/>
Antwerp they were much pleased with a prison for boys, <lb/>
which was admirably arranged and managed; but at <lb/>
Hamelin, in Hanover, they were horrified to find, in the <lb/>
<pb n="148" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0163"/>
men's prison, "four hundred inmates all chained heavily <lb/>
to the ground until they would confess their crimes, whether <lb/>
they had committed them or not."</p>
<p>At Berlin they were received most graciously by the <lb/>
Royal Family, especially by the Princess William, sister of <lb/>
the late King of Prussia. This visit seemed very successful, <lb/>
but an entry in Mrs. Fry's journal at this period gives a <lb/>
hint of approaching age and infirmity.</p>
<p>"I have been poorly enough," she writes, "to have the <lb/>
end of life brought closely before me, and to stimulate me <lb/>
in faith to do quickly what my Lord may require me." <lb/>
The shadows of evening were gathering round the devoted <lb/>
worker, but while strength and life lasted she would labour <lb/>
on. Letters urging her return to the Continent followed <lb/>
her to England; amongst them were some from the Queen <lb/>
and the Princess William of Prussia; and in response to <lb/>
these appeals she set out the following year, accompanied <lb/>
by her brother Joseph John Gurney, his daughter, and her <lb/>
niece Elizabeth. Again she was well received. The King <lb/>
of Holland, after one of the meetings, shook her by the <lb/>
hand, and said, "God bless you, Mrs. Fry, and bless all <lb/>
your endeavours for good!" At Bremen, Pastor Mallet <lb/>
said to her, "Your name has long been a word of beauty <lb/>
to us." Augustus Hare tells us in his "Memorial" that <lb/>
Mrs. Fry used often to describe to her grandchildren her <lb/>
visit to a prison in Hanover. "I found there" she narrates, <lb/>
"more than a thousand prisoners &lpar;mostly confined for <lb/>
small crimes&rpar;, loaded with heavy chains. I was so touched <lb/>
by their misery that it tempted me to represent the cruelty <lb/>
and injustice of their treatment to the Government. A few <lb/>
weeks after, when I visited the prison again, I found, to <lb/>
my surprise and pleasure, that my remonstrance had been <lb/>
listened to, and the chains taken off all the prisoners except <lb/>
one most unruly man. I suppose they knew through whom <lb/>
they were freed from their chains, for I can never forget <lb/>
<pb n="149" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0164"/>
their heartfelt expressions of joy and gratitude at seeing <lb/>
me."</p>
<p>On her return to England Mrs. Fry seemed sadly worn <lb/>
with her fatigues, and her health seemed broken, but <lb/>
the tender ministrations of her family cheered her. The <lb/>
following spring the King of Prussia came over to stand <lb/>
sponsor for the Prince of Wales, and by his desire Mrs. <lb/>
Fry was invited to meet him at luncheon at the Mansion <lb/>
House. The next day he accompanied her to Newgate. <lb/>
A young relation writes: "Cousin Elizabeth Fry read out <lb/>
of some book to the prisoners, and afterwards a Psalm, <lb/>
and then prayed very touchingly, the King and the prisoners <lb/>
kneeling round her, all equally in tears."</p>
<p>A family sorrow befell Mrs. Fry this year in the death <lb/>
of a lovely little grandchild, Harriet Streatfield; and as <lb/>
she stood by her daughter's side by the grave, her gentle <lb/>
voice was heard at the close of the service addressing <lb/>
the bereaved mother: "It is the Lord, let Him do what <lb/>
seemeth Him good."</p>
<p>As Mrs. Fry's health revived in the spring of 1843, she <lb/>
felt it right to pay one more visit to Paris. Her eldest <lb/>
daughter accompanied her, and her brother, Joseph John <lb/>
Gurney, with his wife and Josiah Fowler. In her journal <lb/>
she writes: "My birthday, sixty-three! My God has not <lb/>
forgotten to be gracious, nor hath He shut up His tender <lb/>
mercies from me." She did not go farther than Paris. On <lb/>
this occasion she was summoned to the Duchess of Orleans <lb/>
at the Tuileries, and had many interesting interviews with <lb/>
the Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg. The King also sent <lb/>
for her, and she saw the Queen and Madame Adelaide. <lb/>
She afterwards received from the Queen "a beautiful Bible <lb/>
with fine engravings."</p>
<p>Mrs. Fry's failing health obliged her to give up active <lb/>
work, and in 1844 she wrote to the Committee of the <lb/>
Ladies' British Society: "Amidst the many sorrows which <lb/>
<pb n="150" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0165"/>
have lately been permitted for me to pass through, and <lb/>
bodily sufferings, I still feel a deep and lively interest in the <lb/>
cause of the poor prisoners, and earnest is my prayer that <lb/>
the God of all grace may be near to help you to be <lb/>
steadfast in the important Christian work of seeking to help <lb/>
the poor wanderers to return, repent, and live, that they may <lb/>
know Christ to be their Saviour, Redeemer, and Hope.&hellip; <lb/>
I hope to be remembered in your prayers."</p>
<p>There was no doubt that Mrs. Fry's strength was waning <lb/>
fast. Her enfeebled health obliged her to absent herself <lb/>
from the family gatherings. Her daughters watched over <lb/>
her tenderly, and, in spite of frequent suffering, she would <lb/>
at times "pour out a wonderful stream of rejoicing, a perfect <lb/>
flood of faith and hope." To her daughter Rachel she once <lb/>
said: "I can say this one thing: since my heart was <lb/>
touched at seventeen years old, I believe I never have <lb/>
awakened from sleep, in sickness or in health, by day or <lb/>
by night, without my first waking thought being how I <lb/>
might best serve the Lord." At this time her beloved <lb/>
brother-in-law, Sir Fowell Buxton, was bowed by increasing <lb/>
infirmity, and his declining state gave her much anxiety. <lb/>
Her sister-in-law, Elizabeth Fry, with whom she had made <lb/>
many ministerial tours, had passed away.</p>
<p>In August her son William had taken a house for Mrs. <lb/>
Fry at Walmer; but before she left home he was able to <lb/>
gratify her earnest desire to be present at the Meeting at <lb/>
Plaistow. Sad to say, it was the last office of love that <lb/>
devoted son performed for his mother. He and his younger <lb/>
son conveyed her in a wheeled chair to the meeting, and <lb/>
Elizabeth Fry delivered her solemn address. The Memoir <lb/>
tells:</p>
<p>"The prominent subject of her address was the death <lb/>
of the righteous. She expressed the deepest thankfulness <lb/>
&lpar;alluding to her sister-in-law, Elizabeth Fry&rpar; for the mercies <lb/>
vouchsafed to 'one who, having laboured long amongst <lb/>
<pb n="151" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0166"/>
them, had been called from time to eternity.' She quoted <lb/>
the text, 'Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord, for <lb/>
they rest from their labours, and their works do follow <lb/>
them,'&hellip; and concluded in those words in Isaiah, 'Thine <lb/>
eyes shall see the King in His beauty, they shall behold <lb/>
the land that is very far off.'"</p>
<p>Her removal to Walmer was easily accomplished, and <lb/>
she wrote from there:</p>
<p>"I walk in a low valley, still I believe I may say the <lb/>
everlasting arm is underneath, and the Lord is near to me. <lb/>
I pass through deep waters, but I trust, as the Lord is <lb/>
near to me, they will not overflow me. I need all your <lb/>
prayers in my low estate; I think the deaths of my sisters <lb/>
and little Gurney have been almost too much for me."</p>
<p>This allusion was to the loss of a little grandson in July; <lb/>
but, alas! a fresh tide of sorrow was to engulf her. <lb/>
Terrible news reached her. Scarlet fever had broken out <lb/>
at Plashet Manor-house, the home of William Fry. His <lb/>
second daughter, a lovely child, Juliana, died after a few <lb/>
hours' illness. Some of the servants succumbed, and were <lb/>
taken to Guy's Hospital. The children were removed to <lb/>
Plashet Cottage, and carried back to the Manor-house as <lb/>
they sickened. Then the head of the house took it.</p>
<p>The Memoir gives a touching account of his illness. <lb/>
"For about a week hopes were entertained that this most <lb/>
precious life would be spared to his family; but the fiat had <lb/>
gone forth, and the summons been given. On the day of <lb/>
the funeral of his little Juliana he had asked to have his <lb/>
door open, that he might see the coffin as it was borne by; <lb/>
and then, to the nursing sister by his side, he exclaimed, <lb/>
'I shall go to her, but she shall not return to me."</p>
<p>The fever ran its course, there was little pain, and the <lb/>
invalid continued calm and cheerful. He quite realised his <lb/>
danger, and though he wished to recover, he was willing <lb/>
to abide by the Divine will. "God has never forsaken <lb/>
<pb n="152" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0167"/>
me, no, not for a moment, and He never will," was his <lb/>
exclamation one day. As his last day on earth commenced, <lb/>
he looked out on garden and terrace, and spoke of his many <lb/>
blessings. "God is so good" were his last words. It was <lb/>
a bitter, almost an overwhelming blow, to the bereaved <lb/>
mother; and it was no wonder that for a time she was <lb/>
utterly crushed and wept almost unceasingly. "Can our <lb/>
mother bear this and live?" was the exclamation of her <lb/>
children; but after the first week Elizabeth Fry's saintly <lb/>
and purified spirit seemed to follow her beloved son into <lb/>
the Unseen World and dwell with him there, and her <lb/>
thoughts were also much occupied with his widow and <lb/>
children,&mdash;the eldest girl, Emma, had died a few days after <lb/>
her father. "Christians ought to be cheerful in affliction," <lb/>
she once said; and we are told "that though tears <reg orig="some-|times">sometimes</reg> <lb/>
filled her eyes, her countenance would become almost <lb/>
radiant as she exclaimed, 'And they have entered into <lb/>
everlasting rest.'"</p>
<p>Mrs. Fry still continued in an ailing condition. Her <lb/>
Memoir informs us, "She was generally carried down in a <lb/>
chair about noon and wheeled from room to room; she <lb/>
was dressed as usual, sometimes joining her family at table, <lb/>
and was able to look occasionally at a book. She now <lb/>
attended Meeting once on the Sabbath, her ministry often <lb/>
very beautiful, and not at all partaking of the sort of <lb/>
infirmity which clouded all earthly matters." Some of her <lb/>
speeches to friends at this period are full of beauty and <lb/>
significance, and speak of hidden conflict. "I have passed <lb/>
through deep baptisms of spirit in this illness. I may say, <lb/>
unworthy as I am to say it, that I have had to drink in <lb/>
my small measure of the Saviour's cup when He said, <lb/>
'My God, My God! why hast Thou forsaken Me?'" <lb/>
And again, "My life has been one of great vicissitude; <lb/>
mine is a hidden path, hidden from every human eye. I <lb/>
have had deep humiliations to pass through." And once <lb/>
<pb n="153" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0168"/>
more: "I could often adopt the words of Sir Francis Bacon: <lb/>
'When I have ascended before men, I have descended <lb/>
in humiliation before God.'"</p>
<p>To the close of her life this sore-tried servant of God <lb/>
was to undergo fresh trials. The following year the death <lb/>
of her beloved brother-in-law, Sir T. Fowell Buxton, was <lb/>
a fresh grief. She wrote to her widowed sister: "I live <lb/>
with you in heart by night and day, my tenderly beloved <lb/>
sister.&hellip; My feeling for thee is more than I can express <lb/>
in words."</p>
<p>Mrs. Fry's great wish was to see Earlham, the home of <lb/>
her happy childhood, again. This wish was gratified; she <lb/>
was even drawn in her wheeled chair to the old <reg orig="Meeting-|house">Meeting-house</reg> <lb/>
in Goat Lane, where the row of sisters had once <lb/>
sat Sunday after Sunday; she also had the sad pleasure <lb/>
of being with her sister, Lady Buxton.</p>
<p>On June 26th her youngest son, Harry, was married <lb/>
to Miss Lucy Sheppard. On the return of the wedding <lb/>
party to Upton Lane, we are informed that Mrs. Fry <lb/>
"received her guests in a room opening into the flower <lb/>
garden, and thence was wheeled to the terrace; a very <lb/>
large circle surrounded her, many connections and others <lb/>
of her friends. It was a beautiful scene, the last social <lb/>
family meeting at which she presided; and, although infirm <lb/>
and broken in health, she looked herself." The following <lb/>
week Mrs. Fry was moved to Ashton House, at Ramsgate, <lb/>
where the family of her son William came to her and <lb/>
remained some weeks; afterwards Hannah, Lady Buxton, <lb/>
and her daughter, Richenda, joined her. Daily her <lb/>
weakness increased; but as the end approached, we are <lb/>
told, "That the great terror of death which had beset her <lb/>
through life, seemed to pass away," and "at eventide there <lb/>
was light." And so in peace and love and quiet teaching <lb/>
those last days passed, until October 11th, 1845, when she <lb/>
had a sudden seizure, followed by hours of unconsciousness.</p>
<pb n="154" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0169"/>
<p>Augustus Hare gives a brief memorial of the closing scenes. <lb/>
"On the following morning she was again partially conscious, <lb/>
and said to her maid, 'Oh, Mary, dear Mary, I am very <lb/>
ill; pray for me. It is a strife; but I am safe.' Three <lb/>
hours later, when one of her daughters was sitting by her, <lb/>
she said slowly: 'Oh, my dear Lord, help and keep Thy <lb/>
servant.' These were her last words; and after a few <lb/>
more hours of unconsciousness she passed away. She was <lb/>
buried in the Friends' burial place at Barking, close by the <lb/>
grave of her little Betsy, "where her humble tomb may <lb/>
still be seen in the little green enclosure, with its lilacs and <lb/>
laburnums."</p>
<p>Elizabeth Fry was not more than sixty-five when she died, <lb/>
but she was worn out with work. She had been the <lb/>
messenger of glad tidings to "those who were ready to <lb/>
perish"; she had visited the dungeons and dark places <lb/>
of the earth, and at her gentle pleadings the chains and <lb/>
heavy fetters of the prisoners were removed. Well has <lb/>
it been said, "God buries His workers, but carries on His <lb/>
work"; for since Elizabeth Fry died, her work has grown <lb/>
and ripened. Well may our generation honour and revere <lb/>
her name, for surely of Elizabeth Fry it may be truly said: <lb/>
"Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest <lb/>
them all."</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> list of the notably good women of the Victorian <lb/>
era would be strangely incomplete if the honoured <lb/>
and justly revered name of the Baroness Burdett-Coutts <lb/>
were to be omitted, "the second lady in the land," as the <lb/>
Prince of Wales once termed her, to whom the English <lb/>
nation owes a debt of gratitude for sixty years and more of <lb/>
noble beneficence and splendid but unobtrusive deeds of <lb/>
philanthropy. If one dare coin a title for her it would be <lb/>
"the Friend of the Poor"; for from her youth Lady <reg orig="Burdett-|Coutts">Burdett-Coutts</reg>' <lb/>
heart has beat "with a passionate love for the poor <lb/>
and suffering," and yet how few are aware of even a tithe <lb/>
of the good which she has done in her long life!</p>
<p>Most literally has she fulfilled the Divine injunction, <lb/>
"Let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth," <lb/>
for no blare of trumpet or beat of drum accompanies her <lb/>
acts of princely munificence; for love's sake she has given, <lb/>
touched to the depths of her tender woman's heart by the <lb/>
needs and sorrows of stricken men and weary women and <lb/>
oppressed and miserable children. The same spirit that <lb/>
beat in the noble heart of Lord Shaftesbury throbs in <lb/>
hers; pity for suffering humanity has been the keynote of <lb/>
<pb n="158" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0175"/>
both their lives. The veteran statesman has long entered <lb/>
into his rest, worn out by his self-denying labours, but the <lb/>
Baroness Burdett-Coutts still lives to be a blessing to all <lb/>
around her.</p>
<p>It has been beautifully said by the writer of an article on <lb/>
Lady Burdett-Coutts in the <hi rend="italic">Strand Magazine</hi>: "To look <lb/>
back upon the life of the Baroness is an historical education. <lb/>
One recalls the good and great with whom she has been <lb/>
associated, reads the history of the labouring classes, watches <lb/>
the education of the young, and reviews events which have <lb/>
stirred nations; and in each and every case, where money <lb/>
could help, the Baroness has led the way with munificent <lb/>
benevolence, and, what is more, has brought the effect of <lb/>
her example, and so used her enormous influence, that <lb/>
others have thereby been induced likewise to afford valuable <lb/>
assistance."</p>
<p>There is little record to be obtained of this interesting <lb/>
life. The doors of Holly Lodge have been always open to <lb/>
friends and applicants for relief, but interviewers have never <lb/>
been welcome. In only one solitary instance, we believe, has <lb/>
this rule been relaxed, and to this we owe the charming <lb/>
article which gives us such a pleasant and graphic account <lb/>
of the Baroness at home.</p>
<p>"The wealth of the mind is the only true wealth," Hesiod <lb/>
informs us; but Juvenal adds a startling axiom: "Nothing <lb/>
is more unbearable," he observes, "than a woman with a <lb/>
full purse"; and it is an undoubted fact that preachers, <lb/>
moralists and philosophers have alike dilated on the <reg orig="worth-|lessness">worthlessness</reg> <lb/>
of wealth, heaping up opprobrious terms, such as <lb/>
"filthy lucre," and "dross," as though its very touch were <lb/>
debasing.</p>
<p>That great wealth has its responsibility, its power for <lb/>
good or evil, cannot be denied by any right-minded person. <lb/>
Perhaps it was some natural shrinking from a heavy yoke <lb/>
of obligation that made Agur the son of Jakeh, say "Give <lb/>
<pb n="159" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0176"/>
me neither poverty nor riches." He fears wealth, lest he <lb/>
be tempted to spend it all on his own gratification, and <lb/>
then, in the insolence of his pride and self-pleasing, grow <lb/>
callous, and deny his Maker.</p>
<p>But there is another side to this subject. The parable <lb/>
of the talents throws an unerring light on human <reg orig="respon-|sibility">responsibility</reg>. <lb/>
"To whom much is given much shall be required," <lb/>
and no contemporary of the Baroness Burdett-Coutts can <lb/>
doubt that she has conscientiously, and to the utmost of her <lb/>
ability, used her great wealth for the benefit of her <reg orig="fellow-|creatures">fellow-creatures</reg>. <lb/>
There is something idyllic and like a fairy tale <lb/>
in the story of Angela Georgina Burdett&mdash;afterwards the <lb/>
renowned Baroness Burdett-Coutts.</p>
<p>She was born in 1814. Her father was Sir Francis <lb/>
Burdett, the famous Radical politician, who was imprisoned <lb/>
for his unflinching advocacy of the people's rights. We <lb/>
read "that the guards were pelted with stones as they took <lb/>
their prisoner to the Tower, where he was one of the last <lb/>
men to suffer for his political opinions, and the air was filled <lb/>
with the people's cry, "Burdett for ever!"</p>
<p>Her mother was the daughter of Thomas Coutts, the <lb/>
banker. After her grandmother Mrs. Coutts' death her <lb/>
grandfather married the well-known actress, Miss Mellon. <lb/>
The second Mrs. Coutts seemed to have had a strange, <lb/>
complex nature; but she appeared to have been sincerely <lb/>
attached to her husband, and to have made him a good <lb/>
wife. After his death she married the young and handsome <lb/>
Duke of St. Albans.</p>
<p>Angela Burdett's early years were spent in the village of <lb/>
Ramsbury, in Wiltshire, where Sir Francis Burdett's estate <lb/>
was situated. She had always been the favourite grandchild <lb/>
of the second Mrs. Coutts, but when the latter married <lb/>
again, the great fortune left to her by her husband seemed <lb/>
to have passed away from the Burdett family. But the <lb/>
Duchess of St. Albans, in spite of her eccentricity, was <lb/>
<pb n="160" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0177"/>
determined to do her duty to her first husband's relatives; <lb/>
and when she died, Miss Burdett, then three-and-twenty, <lb/>
found herself the "head of a banking-house second only to <lb/>
the Bank of England, and the richest woman in England."</p>
<p>It was enough to turn the head of any young lady. The <lb/>
story of Cinderella, so dear to childhood, or even the <lb/>
enchanting tale of Aladdin and his wonderful lamp, dwarf <lb/>
into insignificance before this story of true life. One <lb/>
morning Miss Burdett woke to find herself worth thirteen <lb/>
tons of English sovereigns; as a matter of fact, her fortune <lb/>
was &pound;1,800,000. This bequest was left absolutely on <lb/>
condition that the heiress should assume the name and <lb/>
arms of Coutts. From this time she took the name of <lb/>
Burdett-Coutts. To her husband the Duchess of St. Albans <lb/>
left an annuity of &pound;10,000, with the life-rent of the house <lb/>
in Stratton Street, Piccadilly, and her Highgate estate, Holly <lb/>
Lodge, all of which reverted to Miss Burdett-Coutts on <lb/>
his Grace's death in 1849.</p>
<p>It is not surprising to hear that, on Miss Burdett-Coutts' <lb/>
acquisition of this princely revenue, begging-letters and <lb/>
offers of marriage poured in by every post.</p>
<p>The young heiress naturally took her position in society. <lb/>
She was present at the Queen's coronation, and enjoyed a <lb/>
good many splendid functions. The <hi rend="italic">Leisure Hour</hi> of 1870 <lb/>
gives an amusing anecdote, which runs as follows:</p>
<p>"Moore, the poet, relates in his diary that, having seen <lb/>
Miss Coutts in all her splendour at the Queen's ball, he <lb/>
called on her the following day, and found her preparing <lb/>
to send her dress to the bank. 'Would you like,' she <lb/>
asked the poet, 'to see it by daylight?' On his assenting, <lb/>
she took him to a room upstairs, where the treasure was <lb/>
deposited. Amongst it was the famous tiara of Marie <lb/>
Antoinette; and on his asking Miss Coutts what altogether <lb/>
might be the value of the dress, she answered, in her quiet <lb/>
way, 'I think about a hundred thousand pounds.'"</p>
<pb n="161" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0178"/>
<p>But a life of pleasure would never have satisfied Miss <lb/>
Burdett-Coutts, and from the beginning she realised that <lb/>
her vast wealth was to be held in trust for the good of her <lb/>
fellow-creatures. Her sincere and earnest nature enabled <lb/>
her to form many noble and lasting friendships.</p>
<p>The Duke of Wellington was her confidential adviser; <lb/>
and Charles Dickens, the people's novelist, helped her in <lb/>
many of her philanthropical schemes. She accompanied <lb/>
him into the poorest parts of London, and she herself avers <lb/>
that these excursions inspired her with intense pity for the <lb/>
poor. Slumming was not then a fashionable pursuit, and <lb/>
many people must have accused her of eccentricity and <lb/>
rashness; but Miss Burdett-Coutts had plenty of quiet <lb/>
courage, and in her unobtrusive womanly way was well <lb/>
fitted to be a pioneer. She chose Westminster as the field <lb/>
of her earliest acts of beneficence. Her father, Sir Francis <lb/>
Burdett, had been educated at Westminster School, and <lb/>
for thirty years had been the representative of the City of <lb/>
Westminster.</p>
<p>The Baroness Burdett-Coutts, to give her her present <lb/>
title, purchased a site in Rochester Row, and erected the <lb/>
beautiful Gothic church of St. Stephen the Martyr, as a <lb/>
memorial of her father, who had died in 1844. The church <lb/>
was opened in 1850, an ecclesiastical district mapped out, <lb/>
in the centre of the united parishes of St. Margaret's and <lb/>
St. John's, and schools and a vicarage added. It is said <lb/>
the initial cost of the church and schools amounted to <lb/>
nearly &pound;100,000, and that the Baroness, besides providing <lb/>
for the greater part of the endowment, has through all these <lb/>
years practically maintained the work of the parish. The <lb/>
Duke of Wellington presented the altar-cloth for the new <lb/>
church. There is also "a wonderful carpet, worked by <lb/>
some of the best-known ladies of the land, representing the <lb/>
arms of the Baroness, and the various bishoprics, churches, <lb/>
etc., with which her name is inseparably connected."</p>
<pb n="162" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0179"/>
<p>The parish of St. Stephen has been splendidly worked. <lb/>
The <hi rend="italic">Strand</hi> tells us that "clubs, guilds, classes, friendly <lb/>
societies, district visiting, etc., are all in active operation, <lb/>
and, in addition, a self-help club," which, established on <lb/>
co-operative principles, can now show a working capital of <lb/>
&pound;2000." Upwards of fifteen thousand children have been <lb/>
trained in the schools.</p>
<p>While this great work was progressing, Baroness <reg orig="Burdett-|Coutts">Burdett-Coutts</reg>' <lb/>
attention was called to the state of religion in the <lb/>
colonies. We will quote a paragraph in the <hi rend="italic">Leisure Hour</hi> <lb/>
of 1870 on this subject:</p>
<p>"In vain had the Episcopalians of Cape Town repeatedly <lb/>
applied for the appointment of a bishop. Indeed, prior <lb/>
to the year 1847, the time of which we speak, the <reg orig="mother-|church">mother-church</reg> <lb/>
in England had done little for Cape Colony. Three <lb/>
clergymen only had she sent out, and not a single <reg orig="school-|master">schoolmaster</reg>; <lb/>
nor had any funds been raised for the erection of <lb/>
churches and schools.&hellip; It was to remedy this state of <lb/>
matters that the liberality of Miss Burdett-Coutts was exerted <lb/>
in the endowment of the Cape Town bishopric. On St. <lb/>
Peter's Day, 1847, the Rev. Robert Gray was consecrated <lb/>
in Westminster Abbey, and in the February of the following <lb/>
year he arrived at his destination. Within three years of <lb/>
his arrival, so great was the impulse given, the clergy had <lb/>
multiplied nearly fourfold; new churches had sprung up <lb/>
in every direction, the colonies on their part making efforts <lb/>
to correspond in some measure with those of the Church <lb/>
at home."</p>
<p>About the same time Baroness Burdett-Coutts endowed <lb/>
the Bishopric of Adelaide, in South Australia, where Bishop <lb/>
Short began his work in 1847. Before the end of the first <lb/>
year he had consecrated ten churches, while others were <lb/>
being built.</p>
<p>In 1858 the Baroness endowed the bishopric of British <lb/>
Columbia, which had just been proclaimed a British colony. <lb/>
<pb n="163" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0180"/>
On this occasion she gave &pound;25,000 for the endowment of <lb/>
the church, for the bishopric &pound;15,000, and &pound;10,000 for <lb/>
the other clergy. But the building of churches and the <lb/>
founding of bishoprics were not the Baroness' only acts of <lb/>
munificence; the Friend of the Poor was busy on their <lb/>
behalf.</p>
<p>Nova Scotia Gardens, in Bethnal Green, had long been <lb/>
notorious as a resort of thieves and murderers. The place <lb/>
was a trap for fevers and loathsome diseases; the footsteps <lb/>
of the passers-by had sunk in slimy pools and garbage <lb/>
and decaying matter. Struck with the horror and misery <lb/>
of this God-forsaken spot, Lady Burdett-Coutts bought it <lb/>
up, pulled down and utterly demolished the old rookery, <lb/>
and built four blocks of model dwellings, "each block <lb/>
containing between forty and fifty tenements, with every <lb/>
accommodation in the shape of laundry, baths, etc. and <lb/>
the luxury of a good library and reading-room." These <lb/>
splendid blocks of buildings are now known as Columbia <lb/>
Square, and are capable of accommodating more than a <lb/>
thousand people. From the inscription on the clock tower <lb/>
it appears that they were commenced in May 1858 and <lb/>
finished in May 1862. We read that all the model <reg orig="lodging-|houses">lodging-houses</reg> <lb/>
erected from the Peabody Fund were built on the <lb/>
plan of Columbia Square. The magnificent Columbia <lb/>
Market, opened in the presence of Royalty on April 28th, <lb/>
1869, was also erected for the poor of Bethnal Green. <lb/>
"As a market building it is unrivalled throughout the <lb/>
world, and was erected at a cost of about &pound;200,000."</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> declared at the opening, "that the Halles of <lb/>
Paris, and the Central Market of Brussels, are as nothing <lb/>
compared with the beauty of this almost cathedral pile." <lb/>
The <hi rend="italic">Leisure Hour</hi> tells us "that an admirable series of <lb/>
bye-laws, prominently exhibited, for the regulation of the <lb/>
traffic, were drawn out by the Baroness herself, and bear <lb/>
her name." One object of the elaborate decoration was <lb/>
<pb n="164" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0181"/>
to give employment to skilled stone-cutters and carvers <lb/>
then out of work, and also to attract the attention of the <lb/>
frequenters of the market by its artistic beauty.</p>
<p>Strange to say, this magnificent scheme has not been a <lb/>
success; but if the market has proved a failure, and the <lb/>
noble building stands to-day practically unused, "a noble <lb/>
monument of a woman's effort to give the people cheap <lb/>
and wholesome food"; yet, as we read in the pages of <lb/>
the <hi rend="italic">Young Woman</hi>, "it opened up the market question <lb/>
in London, and led to the establishment of the markets <lb/>
at nearly all the great railway termini."</p>
<p>It is almost impossible even to enumerate the good <lb/>
works of the Baroness Burdett-Coutts. No noble cause, <lb/>
no cry of distress, appealed to her in vain. "Brown's <lb/>
Lane" was another spot brightened by her benevolence. <lb/>
Thirty or forty years ago the importation of foreign silks <lb/>
had led to dire distress amongst the hand-weavers. They <lb/>
were almost starving, when the Baroness came forward to <lb/>
their relief. Some of the people were sent out as emigrants, <lb/>
others were started in business, and a hundred and fifty <lb/>
poor needlewomen were kept in constant work by getting <lb/>
the Government contract for navy shirts, etc. The "Brown <lb/>
Lane's Charity," where the poor women got their meals as <lb/>
well as their work in a sort of sewing-room, was an immense <lb/>
boon; after 1.30 they could earn from eight to fifteen <lb/>
shillings a week. The work, as we read in the <hi rend="italic">Strand</hi>, <lb/>
consisted of shirt-making for the police and soldiers, and <lb/>
each woman as she came in commenced with a good plain <lb/>
meal. "From this place nurses were sent out amongst <lb/>
the sick with wine and other comforts, while outfits were <lb/>
provided for poor servants and winter clothing for deserving <lb/>
women."</p>
<p>When, later on, the tanners were in great distress, this <lb/>
large-hearted woman was ready again with her help; but, <lb/>
as is well known, her charity has been dispensed in every <lb/>
<pb n="165" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0182"/>
needy district of East London for sixty years. When the <lb/>
terrible cholera epidemic broke out in 1867, in the East <lb/>
End of London, Baroness Burdett-Coutts' charity was as <lb/>
active as ever. The writer in the <hi rend="italic">Strand</hi> has given us <lb/>
full particulars. "Under the superintendence of a qualified <lb/>
medical man she employed eight trained nurses, two sanitary <lb/>
inspectors, and under their orders four men to distribute <lb/>
disinfectant." A long list of gifts during the course of one <lb/>
week is then enumerated: "560 quarts of milk, 25 gallons <lb/>
of brandy, 50 gallons of port wine, and 20 gallons of <reg orig="beef-|tea">beef-tea</reg>, <lb/>
100 blankets, 400 yards of flannel, and 400 garments," <lb/>
representing only part of the list.</p>
<p>A Shoeblack Brigade, a Boys' Club, a Relief Committee, <lb/>
as well as the recent Flower Girls' Brigade, have all been <lb/>
inaugurated or helped by this benevolent patron. This last <lb/>
society has put upwards of eight hundred girls into a more <lb/>
desirable way of gaining their livelihood. Only a few months <lb/>
ago the Baroness was pleading the cause of the East End <lb/>
matchgirls, and she has always been a generous supporter <lb/>
of the Destitute Children's Dinner Society, which gives three <lb/>
hundred thousand dinners a year to the children of the <lb/>
London poor; indeed, since the death of the Earl of <reg orig="Shaftes-|bury">Shaftesbury</reg> <lb/>
she has been its president. The Baroness's love for <lb/>
children is well known; thousands of ragged little ones <lb/>
have been familiar with the grounds of Holly Lodge. The <lb/>
formation of the National Society for the Prevention of <lb/>
Cruelty to Children was chiefly due to her&mdash;at least, she was <lb/>
one of the pioneers of the movement, and the first committee <lb/>
meeting was held in her drawing-room.</p>
<p>She took a great interest in the costermongers&mdash;"the <lb/>
tradesmen of the streets," as they are called. She once <lb/>
sent a party of them to the Lyceum to see Sir Henry <lb/>
Irving in <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi>; and a small donkey in silver, presented <lb/>
to her by the costers, is one of her most treasured <reg orig="posses-|sions">possessions</reg>. <lb/>
It is impossible to do more than briefly enumerate <lb/>
<pb n="166" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0183"/>
a few of her most important charities. When in future <lb/>
years her biography is written, the story of this noble life <lb/>
will be full of thrilling interest.</p>
<p>Though in no way connected with Carlisle, the <reg orig="represen-|tations">representations</reg> <lb/>
of Bishop Waldegrave concerning the needs of his <lb/>
diocese induced Baroness Burdett-Coutts to build at her <lb/>
sole cost the church of St. Stephen's, in the Citadel Station <lb/>
district of the town. Up to that time the congregation had <lb/>
worshipped in a disused warehouse. The scheme in which <lb/>
Charles Dickens took the greatest interest was the Urania <lb/>
College at Shepherd's Bush. In one article we read, "that <lb/>
he drew up the rules, superintended the purchase of land <lb/>
and building, and attended personally to the furnishing. He <lb/>
visited the prisons, interviewed magistrates and governors, <lb/>
and wrote letters such as he only could write to many an <lb/>
unhappy woman in need of a helping hand." This <reg orig="estab-|lishment">establishment</reg> <lb/>
at Shepherd's Bush was for the reform of young <lb/>
women. "There is a lady in this town," wrote the novelist <lb/>
in his pathetic way, "who, from the windows of her house, <lb/>
has seen such as you going past at night, and has felt her <lb/>
heart bleed at the sight. She is what is called a great <lb/>
lady.&hellip; She has resolved to open a home.&hellip; In this <lb/>
home, which stands in a pleasant country lane, and where <lb/>
each may have her little flower garden if she likes, they <lb/>
will lead an active, cheerful, healthy life,&hellip; will begin <lb/>
life afresh, and be able to win a good name and character." <lb/>
It is pleasant to know that this admirable institution has <lb/>
prospered." The Baroness took a great interest in the <lb/>
Whitelands Training College at Chelsea, and gave prizes to <lb/>
some of the most proficient pupil-teachers. Ireland, too, <lb/>
has received substantial help from this universal benefactress, <lb/>
and her loan of &pound;10,000 to the fishermen of Skibbereen, <lb/>
and the Fishery School she established, won for her the <lb/>
love of Irish people. Her generosity flowed into other <lb/>
channels; for she provided funds for a topographical survey <lb/>
<pb n="167" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0184"/>
of Jerusalem, and offered to reinstate the Aqueducts of <lb/>
Solomon, so as to guarantee a constant supply of water.</p>
<p>It is interesting to remember that a warm friendship <lb/>
existed between her and the great English hero, General <lb/>
Gordon, and her appeal to the women of England on behalf <lb/>
of the Gordon Memorial College was felt to be fitting. We <lb/>
are told in one magazine, "that before Gordon went to <lb/>
Khartoum he spent almost his last hours with the Baroness, <lb/>
and it was through her that the General received his last <lb/>
batch of letters and papers from home, the Baroness <reg orig="en-|gaging">engaging</reg> <lb/>
a Morocco trader to disguise himself for the purpose <lb/>
of delivering them."</p>
<p>Lady Burdett-Coutts' love of animals is well known. She <lb/>
always took the deepest interest in the Society for the <lb/>
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and the foundation <lb/>
stone of the institution in Jermyn Street was laid by her. <lb/>
She attended meetings, identified herself with the annual <lb/>
Cart Horse Parades at London, Newcastle, etc., and gave <lb/>
prizes to the costermongers who could show well fed and <lb/>
well kept donkeys. At Holly Lodge there are innumerable <lb/>
animals, from "Cocky," her favourite cockatoo, to the white <lb/>
donkey presented her by the grateful costers, and the <lb/>
champion of the goat stables, "Sir Garnet," and "Peter" <lb/>
and "Prince," her pet dogs.</p>
<p>It gave universal satisfaction when Her Majesty the <lb/>
Queen bestowed a peerage, in 1871, as a mark of personal <lb/>
esteem. Baroness Burdett-Coutts' marriage to Mr. Ashmead <lb/>
Bartlett in 1881 was a great surprise to her friends, the <lb/>
Baroness being at the time of her marriage sixty-seven and <lb/>
Mr. Ashmead Bartlett only thirty. Seventeen years have <lb/>
passed since then, and it is a satisfaction to be assured <lb/>
by the writer in <hi rend="italic">The Young Woman</hi> that the Baroness has <lb/>
never regretted this step. "Happy as her life has been," <lb/>
she writes, "the last seventeen years have been by far the <lb/>
happiest part of it."</p>
<pb n="168" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0185"/>
<p>Mr. Burdett-Coutts has interested himself in all his wife's <lb/>
schemes; and we read, previous to his marriage, "that his <lb/>
visit to Turkey during the war, when the Baroness raised <lb/>
&pound;30,000 in a few days for the distressed peasants, and his <lb/>
subsequent tour in the west of Ireland during the famine <lb/>
of 1880, were purely voluntary undertakings." He takes <lb/>
an active part in the Baroness' charitable work, and is a <lb/>
cultured, scholarly man.</p>
<p>Holly Lodge seems a charming retreat. The writer of the <lb/>
article in the <hi rend="italic">Strand</hi> tells us: "That the house has much <lb/>
the appearance of a 'bungalow.' It is quite small, surrounded <lb/>
by a verandah, with its trellis-work covered with hops, <lb/>
Virginia and other creepers; about fifty-two acres of <lb/>
garden and park surround it, so well wooded that, from <lb/>
the house, all one gets of the exterior world is a glimpse <lb/>
of a church spire."</p>
<p>In this peaceful seclusion, and in the society of her <lb/>
chosen companion, Baroness Burdett-Coutts spends the <lb/>
sunset of her long and honoured life, beloved and revered <lb/>
by all who know her. There are certain words in the <lb/>
Book of books which come into one's mind as one dwells <lb/>
with feelings of veneration on this bright example of <lb/>
womanly sympathy and benevolence, and which might <lb/>
fitly be spoken by her:&mdash;</p>
<p>"When the ear heard me, then it blessed me; and when <lb/>
the eye saw me, it gave witness to me:</p>
<p>"Because I delivered the poor that cried, and the <reg orig="father-|less">fatherless</reg>, <lb/>
and him that had none to help him.</p>
<p>"The blessing of him that was ready to perish came <lb/>
upon me; and I caused the widows' heart to sing for joy"</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">There</hi> are few of us who do not love the dear old <lb/>
fairy stories of our childhood. We have grown old <lb/>
and a little careworn and hardened, perhaps, with the dull <lb/>
prose of life; but in our memories the old tales are still <lb/>
fresh and fragrant. How we thrilled as we read them, <lb/>
how our cheeks flushed with excitement as we turned the <lb/>
beloved pages, how they haunted our childish dreams&mdash; <lb/>
Cinderella, and Little Red Riding Hood, Beauty and <lb/>
the Beast, Gracioso and Percinette, and a host of others <lb/>
gaily tripping on each other's heels!</p>
<p>There was nothing new in the drama or the <hi rend="italic">d&eacute;no&ugrave;ement</hi>, <lb/>
but the very monotony and poorness of invention were <lb/>
dear to our infantine minds; always there was the Princess <lb/>
&mdash;golden of locks, glorious in virtues, and marvellously <lb/>
afflicted. Sometimes she is in rags and her feet are bare, <lb/>
or the wicked influence of a cruel witch of a stepmother <lb/>
has shut her up in a brazen tower. Poor little Princess <lb/>
Beautiful,&mdash;what hardships she endures, what herculean <lb/>
labours are laid upon her, what rivers of tears flow from <lb/>
<pb n="172" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0191"/>
her lovely eyes!&mdash;but though we quivered with excitement <lb/>
and sympathy, we knew the tale would end happily. Down <lb/>
the long avenues rides the Prince, splendid in glittering <lb/>
armour, or doublet of cloth of gold; as the little Princess <lb/>
looks down at him, he doffs his jewelled cap. "Love, will <lb/>
you marry me?" he cries, for his wooing is brief and <lb/>
masterful. "Marry him?" Has she not been watching <lb/>
for him for a year at least? is he not her deliverer, her <lb/>
champion? and so "beyond the night, across the day, <lb/>
Thro' all the world she follow'd him!"</p>
<p>Oh the beloved old nursery legends! "earnest wed with <lb/>
sport," but sacred to us with wonderful esoteric meanings <lb/>
Sometimes in later life, even in modern days, one sees <lb/>
strange versions of the old fables.</p>
<p>"Once upon a time, a good many years ago, three young <lb/>
princesses sat in a beautiful old wood; they were talking <lb/>
in na&iuml;ve girlish fashion of their hopes for the future.</p>
<p>"'I should like,' said one Princess, who was very lively <lb/>
and vivacious, 'I should like to have all the best things <lb/>
which the world can give, so that I could do much good.'</p>
<p>"'I,' observed a younger Princess, 'should like to be <lb/>
very clever, and wise, and good.'</p>
<p>"'And I,' observed the third Princess, thoughtfully, <lb/>
'should like best to be loved.'"</p>
<p>The beautiful wood was not an enchanted one, for it was <lb/>
Bernstorff, and the names of the three princesses were <lb/>
Dagmar, Thyra, and Alexandra. If this little story be true, <lb/>
it gives a good idea of Princess Alexandra's disposition in <lb/>
her girlhood.</p>
<p>In recalling the early life of Princess Alexandra one is <lb/>
somehow reminded forcibly of a fairy story. True, there is <lb/>
no oppressed or unhappy princess to be rescued from <lb/>
barbarous confinement, for her life was sheltered and <lb/>
tenderly watched by careful and loving parents; but the <lb/>
sudden change from her simple retired life in the G&ucirc;le <lb/>
<pb n="173" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0192"/>
Palais and the Ch&acirc;teau of Bernstorff to her brilliant position <lb/>
as Princess of Wales must have been almost overpowering.</p>
<p>Princess Alexandra's father, Prince Christian, belonged <lb/>
to a younger branch of the House of Oldenburg, and at the <lb/>
time of her birth he was not in expectation of succeeding <lb/>
to the throne. He was the son of the Duke of <reg orig="Schleswig-|Holstein">Schleswig-Holstein</reg> <lb/>
Sonderburg Gl&uuml;cksburg, and was born at Gottorp <lb/>
Castle. His father died when he was thirteen, and on his <lb/>
death-bed he committed the young Christian to the <reg orig="guardian-|ship">guardianship</reg> <lb/>
of his kinsman, Christian VIII. of Denmark. The <lb/>
king adopted him as a son, gave him a home in his palace, <lb/>
and sent him to be educated at the Landskadet, or Military <lb/>
Academy, in Copenhagen. After completing his studies, <lb/>
Prince Christian received a commission in the horse guards, <lb/>
and at twenty-two, with the king's approval, he married <lb/>
Princess Louisa of Hesse-Cassel, daughter of the Landgraf <lb/>
William, and niece of Christian VIII. and the Duchess of <lb/>
Cambridge.</p>
<p>The young couple commenced housekeeping on a modest <lb/>
income in the G&ucirc;le Palais, where their five children were born: <lb/>
the present Crown Prince Frederick of Denmark, Princess <lb/>
Alexandra, George afterwards King of Greece, Dagmar, <lb/>
Dowager Empress of Russia, Thyra Duchess of <reg orig="Cumber-|land">Cumberland</reg>, <lb/>
and Valdemar, who afterwards married Princess Marie <lb/>
of Orleans. The G&ucirc;le Palais, in spite of its imposing name, <lb/>
was merely a substantial dwelling, and somewhat <reg orig="unpre-|tentious">unpretentious</reg>; <lb/>
at the present time, although it is the town residence <lb/>
of Prince Valdemar, only the red sentinel-boxes distinguish <lb/>
it from the other houses in Amaliegade. The description <lb/>
that we read in an interesting article by an Englishwoman in <lb/>
Denmark is not very inviting. The dull courtyard, shut in <lb/>
by high walls, the stone passages and old-fashioned winding <lb/>
staircases, the simply furnished rooms, the pleasant suite of <lb/>
drawing-rooms opening on to an iron verandah and <reg orig="over-|looking">overlooking</reg> <lb/>
Amaliegade Street. Such was the G&ucirc;le Palais, <lb/>
<pb n="174" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0193"/>
such the simple environment of the young princess, and for <lb/>
many years her only home. The very room where she was <lb/>
born, we are told, "had windows with a very unlovely view <lb/>
of the courtyard and the chimneys and smoke-begrimed walls <lb/>
of the neighbouring houses."</p>
<p>Princess Christian was a very clever and accomplished <lb/>
woman, and her husband was a well-read man of studious <lb/>
habits. Their income was small, and did not allow them <lb/>
to engage resident tutors and governesses for their children, <lb/>
but teachers came for a few hours daily, and they <reg orig="them-|selves">themselves</reg> <lb/>
helped to instruct them. Princess Alexandra, who <lb/>
was the beauty of the family, was not at all partial to lessons, <lb/>
but, as she herself said, "We were made to learn when we <lb/>
were children; our parents told us that it was necessary."</p>
<p>The wise and careful mother taught her young daughters <lb/>
to make their own dresses and trim their hats; and as the <lb/>
staff of servants at the G&ucirc;le Palais was small, the young <lb/>
princesses were brought up to do little household tasks. <lb/>
Princess Alexandra, in spite of her dislike for lessons, <reg orig="in-|herited">inherited</reg> <lb/>
her mother's musical talent and skill in needlework.</p>
<p>In 1852 the death of Christian VIII., and the accession <lb/>
of his son Frederick VII. to the Danish throne, made a <lb/>
great change in Prince Christian's life. He was formally <lb/>
nominated as heir to the throne, and the Ch&acirc;teau of <reg orig="Bern-|storff">Bernstorff</reg>, <lb/>
situated about eight miles from Copenhagen, was <lb/>
purchased by the nation and given to him as a summer <lb/>
residence. From this time he occupied the position of <lb/>
Prince of Denmark, although he had no increase of income, <lb/>
and the family lived in the same simple style.</p>
<p>But it was a delightful change for the little princess and <lb/>
her brothers and sisters, and they led the merriest and <lb/>
freest lives, "roaming the woods," as we are told, "<reg orig="gather-|ing">gathering</reg> <lb/>
wild flowers, swinging on the branches of the great trees <lb/>
in the adjacent forests, cantering along the country roads <lb/>
on their ponies, and tending their pet animals."</p>
<pb n="175" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0194"/>
<p>Each Sunday saw the Prince and Princess Christian <lb/>
walking with their children to the quaint little kirk of <lb/>
Gjentoftie, to worship with the simple villagers.</p>
<p>Princess Alexandra and her sisters loved to visit the <lb/>
cottages of these Danish peasants, and, as she grew older, <lb/>
she took great delight in ministering to the sick and infirm; <lb/>
and it is interesting to know that this youthful philanthropy <lb/>
became the habit of her life, and that at Sandringham she <lb/>
still cares for the poor and needy, as she did in her girlhood <lb/>
for the peasants of Gjentoftie.</p>
<p>It was the Lutheran priest at Gjentoftie who prepared <lb/>
Princess Alexandra for confirmation. She was then about <lb/>
sixteen, but the ceremony itself took place in the Chapel <lb/>
Royal attached to the Christianborg Palace, Copenhagen. <lb/>
The Princess was confirmed with her brother, the present <lb/>
Crown Prince; and her loveliness, when she appeared in <lb/>
her white confirmation dress, was the talk in Copenhagen.</p>
<p>When quite a child, Princess Alexandra had been brought <lb/>
to England on a visit to her great-aunt, the Duchess of <lb/>
Cambridge; but it is extremely doubtful whether she and <lb/>
the Prince of Wales met at this early age.</p>
<p>Frederick VII.'s morganatic marriage with the Countess <lb/>
Danner had prevented Princess Christian from presenting <lb/>
her young daughters at the Danish court; but Princess <lb/>
Alexandra occasionally accompanied her parents to some of <lb/>
the minor German courts, or to Brussels. News of the <lb/>
young Danish beauty reached the ears of the Prince of <lb/>
Wales, and he was much charmed by her photograph when <lb/>
it was shown him by one of his friends. A few days later <lb/>
he saw a miniature of the same lovely face at the house <lb/>
of the Duchess of Cambridge, and we are told that he <lb/>
contrived to waive the German alliance that the Queen <lb/>
was contemplating for him, and that he determined to send <lb/>
a trusty and confidential friend to Copenhagen to ascertain <lb/>
if the Princess were really as beautiful as her photograph. <lb/>
<pb n="176" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0195"/>
There is a pretty description of the visit of this envoy to <lb/>
the G&ucirc;le Palais, and the lovely blue-eyed princess coming <lb/>
down to him in her simple white dress and wreath of blush <lb/>
roses, looking as fresh and fair as a young Hebe. The <lb/>
description given by the friend made the Prince of Wales <lb/>
eager to see her for himself.</p>
<p>No one quite knows whether that first meeting was <reg orig="pre-|arranged">prearranged</reg> <lb/>
or purely accidental; but during the Prince's foreign <lb/>
tour in 1861 he went with his tutor and equerry to examine <lb/>
the frescoes of the beautiful old Cathedral of Worms, when <lb/>
he encountered Prince Christian of Denmark and his eldest <lb/>
daughter intent on the same object.</p>
<p>Somewhat later, while staying with his sister, the Crown <lb/>
Princess of Prussia, at Heidelberg, the Prince met her <lb/>
again. "We hear nothing but excellent accounts of the <lb/>
Princess Alexandra," the Prince Consort writes in his diary <lb/>
on September 30th, and adds, evidently with satisfaction, <lb/>
"that the young people seem to have taken a warm liking <lb/>
for each other"; and in a letter to Baron Stockmar a little <lb/>
later: "The Prince of Wales leaves to-morrow for Cambridge, <lb/>
and three days later Louis, Prince of Hesse, returns to <lb/>
Darmstadt. The former has come back, greatly pleased <lb/>
with his interview with the Princess of Holstein at Speier."</p>
<p>A few months later, after the Prince Consort's death, <lb/>
the young Prince met Princess Alexandra at King Leopold's <lb/>
country seat at Laeken. It was this wise and trusted <lb/>
friend of the Queen whose advice overcame her Majesty's <lb/>
unwillingness to accept a Danish alliance in place of the <lb/>
contemplated German one, and it was while the Prince was <lb/>
at Laeken that her formal consent was given.</p>
<p>The betrothal of the Royal pair took place on September <lb/>
9th, 1862; but it was not until the eve of the Prince's <lb/>
coming of age that it was formally announced in the <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">London Gazette</hi>. On the proposal of Lord Palmerston, <lb/>
it was decided that the Prince of Wales should receive <lb/>
<pb n="177" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0196"/>
&pound;40,000 a year, and that &pound;10,000 a year should be set <lb/>
apart for the Princess. At their marriage the Prince of <lb/>
Wales and his bride would start with an income rather over <lb/>
&pound;100,000 a year; "for, owing to the Prince Consort's <lb/>
foresight and good sense, out of the savings made during <lb/>
his son's long minority, Sandringham &lpar;the initial cost was <lb/>
&pound;220,000&rpar; had been purchased. The Royal engagement <lb/>
lasted six months. The young Princess and her father <lb/>
paid an informal visit to the Queen at Osborne, but it was <lb/>
of a strictly private character.</p>
<p>Great was the satisfaction of Prince and Princess Christian <lb/>
at the brilliant alliance that their daughter was making, and <lb/>
the Princess herself was much engrossed by the preparation <lb/>
of her trousseau. We are informed "that the Princess <lb/>
once told an intimate friend that her trousseau cost twice <lb/>
her father's income for a whole year." One can imagine <lb/>
the young girl's delight at the splendour and bewildering <lb/>
number of her toilettes. Presents poured in upon the <lb/>
young bride-elect. The Danes raised a hundred thousand <lb/>
kroners as "the people's dowry"; but, by the Princess' <lb/>
own desire, three thousand thalers were distributed among <lb/>
six Danish brides belonging to the poorer classes&mdash;a kind <lb/>
and graceful thought, and worthy of her great heart. King <lb/>
Frederick, amongst other handsome presents, gave her a <lb/>
superb diamond and pearl necklace, with a facsimile of <lb/>
the famous Dagmar Cross of Denmark suspended from it; <lb/>
and King Leopold of Belgium presented the wedding-dress, <lb/>
which was of exquisite Brussels lace over white satin.</p>
<p>But, perhaps, amid all the rich offerings, nothing could <lb/>
have touched the Princess' heart more than the pair of <lb/>
porcelain vases presented to her by a deputation of peasants <lb/>
from the village of Gjentoftie, with the aged pastor at their <lb/>
head: one can scarcely wonder that the young Princess <lb/>
could not restrain her tears as she strove to utter her thanks. <lb/>
It must have been like a fairy story to the fair young bride, <lb/>
<pb n="178" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0197"/>
as the presents poured in in lavish abundance. We are <lb/>
informed that amongst the bridegroom's gifts "there was <lb/>
a complete set of diamonds and pearls, comprising diadem, <lb/>
necklace, stomacher, and bracelet; also a beautiful <reg orig="waist-|clasp">waist-clasp</reg>, <lb/>
formed of two large turquoises inlaid with Arabic <lb/>
characters, and mounted in gold." The Queen presented <lb/>
her future daughter-in-law with a set of opals and diamonds, <lb/>
similar in form to that designed for the Princess Alice <lb/>
by the Prince Consort. Her Majesty also gave a superb <lb/>
centrepiece and a great deal of valuable plate.</p>
<p>On March 7th, 1863, London was <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italic">en f&ecirc;te</hi></foreign>, for "the <reg orig="sea-|king's">sea-king's</reg> <lb/>
daughter from over the sea" was coming to wed the <lb/>
young heir-apparent to the English throne. It was a sight <lb/>
never to be forgotten, a pageant that lingers in the memory <lb/>
of all who saw that wonderful and triumphal progress. <lb/>
From a warehouse near London Bridge the writer looked <lb/>
down on what seemed a marvellous transformation scene. <lb/>
The grey old bridge lying hushed and silent in the March <lb/>
sunlight, draped with fluttering pennons and Venetian <lb/>
masts, the waiting thousands, then the thrill of <reg orig="excite-|ment">excitement</reg>, <lb/>
the shouts, the roar of voices, like a mighty wave <lb/>
of sound: "Alexandra! God bless her! God bless her <lb/>
bonnie face!" One can imagine the proud delight of the <lb/>
parents and the young <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italic">fianc&eacute;e</hi></foreign>; but the sweet personality <lb/>
of the youthful bride-elect drew all eyes like a magnet. <lb/>
Once, as the carriage stopped, perhaps because of the <lb/>
press of the surging multitude, and the cries of welcome <lb/>
grew louder and louder, the Princess rose from her seat <lb/>
and stood up in the carriage&mdash;a slender, girlish figure, clad <lb/>
in regal purple mantle&mdash;and bowed and smiled with an <lb/>
innocent winsomeness that won all hearts.</p>
<p>An ideal princess certainly. What was Cinderella in <lb/>
her pumpkin chariot compared to this fair young girl, the <lb/>
daughter of the old Vikings, coming in her sweet triumph <lb/>
to win a million hearts?</p>
<pb n="179" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0198"/>
<p>But, with all its splendour and joyous welcomes, it must <lb/>
have been a weary day to the Princess elect. From early <lb/>
morning to late afternoon there was no pause or rest: even <lb/>
when Windsor was reached there was the address from the <lb/>
Eton boys, and the arrival at the Castle, where the Queen, <lb/>
surrounded by her children, received her future <reg orig="daughter-|in-law">daughter-in-law</reg>. <lb/>
Two days of retirement and much-needed rest <lb/>
followed. Then came the eventful 10th March.</p>
<p>It is worthy of note that the marriage of the Prince and <lb/>
Princess of Wales was the first Royal marriage which had <lb/>
been celebrated in St. George's Chapel since that of Henry I <lb/>
in 1142. Frith's celebrated picture gives us a good idea <lb/>
of the ceremony&mdash;the beautiful young Princess in bridal <lb/>
array, and the youthful bridegroom in the uniform of a <lb/>
British general and the purple mantle of a Knight of the <lb/>
Garter. The bride's train was carried by her eight <reg orig="brides-|maids&mdash;Lady">bridesmaids&mdash;Lady</reg> <lb/>
Victoria Scott, Lady Victoria Howard, Lady <lb/>
Augusta Yorke, Lady Feodora Wellesley, Lady Diana <lb/>
Beauclerk, Lady Georgina Hamilton, Lady Alma Bruce, <lb/>
and Lady Helena Hare. "It was an extraordinarily <reg orig="magni-|ficent">magnificent</reg> <lb/>
pageant," we are informed; "heralds and trumpeters <lb/>
in coats of cloth of gold adding to the brilliancy and pomp. <lb/>
No touch of mourning was allowed to mar the brightness <lb/>
of the occasion."</p>
<p>From the Royal closet overlooking the altar Her Majesty, <lb/>
in widow's dress, only just relieved by the broad blue <lb/>
ribbon of the Garter with the glittering star, surveyed the <lb/>
scene. We are told that the Prince uttered his responses <lb/>
clearly, but that the bride's answers were almost inaudible.</p>
<p>Dr. Norman Macleod wrote: "I returned home and went <lb/>
back to the marriage on the 10th March. I got behind <lb/>
Kingsley, Stanley, Birch, and in a famous place, being in <lb/>
front of the Royal pair. We saw better than any except <lb/>
the clergy. It was a gorgeous sight, yet somehow it did not <lb/>
excite me. I suppose I am past this.</p>
<pb n="180" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0199"/>
<p>"Two things struck me much. One was the whole of <lb/>
the Royal Princesses weeping, though concealing their tears <lb/>
with their bouquets, as they saw their brother, who was <lb/>
to them but their 'Bertie,' and their dead father's son, <lb/>
standing alone waiting for his bride. The other was the <lb/>
Queen's expression, as she raised her eyes to Heaven while <lb/>
her husband's Chorale was sung. She seemed to be with <lb/>
him alone before the throne of God."</p>
<p>The Prince and Princess spent a short honeymoon at <lb/>
Osborne, returning afterwards to Windsor. Easter Sunday <lb/>
was spent at their new home, Sandringham. Dean Stanley <lb/>
was their guest. "On the evening of Easter Eve," he writes, <lb/>
"the Princess came to me in a corner of the drawing-room <lb/>
with her Prayer Book; and I went through the Communion <lb/>
Service with her, explaining the peculiarities and the <reg orig="like-|nesses">likenesses</reg> <lb/>
and differences to and from the Danish service. <lb/>
She was most simple and fascinating.&hellip; My visit to <lb/>
Sandringham gave me intense pleasure. I was there for <lb/>
three days. I read the whole Service, preached, then gave <lb/>
the first English Sacrament to this 'angel in the palace.' I <lb/>
saw a great deal of her, and can truly say that she is as <lb/>
charming and beautiful a creature as ever passed through <lb/>
a fairy tale."</p>
<p>There was little doubt that the Princess was winning her <lb/>
position as "Queen of Hearts." Lady Waterford gives a <lb/>
charming description in a letter dated March 25th, 1863. <lb/>
"At the Friday Reception I saw the graceful, charming <lb/>
young Princess of Wales, and she in no way disappointed <lb/>
me. There was something charming in that very young <lb/>
pair, walking up the room together. Her graceful bows <lb/>
and carriage you will delight in, and she has, with lovely <lb/>
youth and well-formed features, a look of great intelligence <lb/>
beyond that of a mere pretty girl. She wore the coronet <lb/>
of diamonds which I saw drawn in the <hi rend="italic">Illustrated News</hi>, <lb/>
and a long-trained gown of cloth of silver trimmed with <lb/>
<pb n="181" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0200"/>
lace, pearl and diamond necklace, bracelet, and a stomacher; <lb/>
and two lovelocks of rich brown hair floated on her <lb/>
shoulders."</p>
<p>The spring passed gaily for the newly-wedded pair. They <lb/>
were entertained sumptuously at Guildhall, attended <reg orig="Com-|memoration">Commemoration</reg> <lb/>
at Oxford, and celebrated their house-warming <lb/>
at their town residence, Marlborough House, by an evening <lb/>
party and a ball. They spent the summer months at <reg orig="Sand-|ringham">Sandringham</reg>, <lb/>
in the old house, which has been replaced by a <lb/>
larger and more comfortable mansion.</p>
<p>Early in January the next year the Princess gave birth to <lb/>
a son somewhat unexpectedly: she had been skating on <lb/>
Virginia Water a few hours previously. Princess Alice wrote <lb/>
to the Queen: "I was aghast on receiving Bertie's telegram <lb/>
this morning announcing the birth of their little son." <lb/>
Happily both mother and child made good progress. The <lb/>
babe at his christening received the names of Albert Victor, <lb/>
and was afterwards created Duke of Clarence.</p>
<p>When her first child was born the Princess was not yet <lb/>
twenty, but we are informed "that she seems to have been <lb/>
wholly absorbed in her maternal duties, and at any moment <lb/>
she would joyfully give up attending a State function or ball <lb/>
in order to spend an hour in her nursery."</p>
<p>That autumn the Prince and Princess, accompanied by <lb/>
their infant son, paid a visit to Denmark. It was the Prince <lb/>
of Wales's first visit to his wife's home. They stayed at <lb/>
Bernstorff, and then from Elsinore they went in their yacht <lb/>
to Stockholm to see the King and Queen of Sweden. After <lb/>
sending their child home under the care of Countess de <lb/>
Grey, the Royal couple travelled <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italic">vi&acirc;</hi></foreign> Germany and Belgium, <lb/>
visiting Princess Alice at Darmstadt. The Princess spent <lb/>
her twentieth birthday at Sandringham.</p>
<p>The following year, 1865, Prince George of Wales, <lb/>
afterwards Duke of York, was born at Marlborough <lb/>
House.</p>
<pb n="182" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0201"/>
<p>The year 1867 was an anxious one for the young couple, <lb/>
for both before and after the birth of her third child, Princess <lb/>
Louise, on February 20th, the Princess of Wales suffered <lb/>
from acute rheumatism and inflammation of the knee-joint. <lb/>
Her condition was so suffering that her parents came over <lb/>
from Denmark and spent some time in London.</p>
<p>A memoir of the Prince of Wales tells us that "the <lb/>
Prince was most devoted in his attentions to the invalid, <lb/>
and actually had his bureau moved into her sick room, in <lb/>
order that he might not be separated from her in her <reg orig="con-|valescence">convalescence</reg> <lb/>
even by the imperious demands of his enormous <lb/>
correspondence. Happily, Her Royal Highness grew quite <lb/>
strong again; but the serious nature of her illness may be <lb/>
judged from the fact that she was not able to drive out <lb/>
until July 9th. Naturally for the rest of the year the Prince <lb/>
and Princess lived very quietly, and went about as little as <lb/>
possible."</p>
<p>Five years after their marriage the Prince and Princess <lb/>
of Wales paid a visit to Ireland, and met with an enthusiastic <lb/>
reception, and on July 6th their fourth child, Princess Victoria, <lb/>
was born. After a quiet summer at Sandringham, they left <lb/>
England in November, attended by a small suite, for a long <lb/>
Continental tour. The Princess spent her birthday <reg orig="&lpar;Decem-|ber">&lpar;December</reg> <lb/>
1st&rpar; in Denmark. After a short stay they went to <lb/>
Berlin, and then to Vienna. Then they proceeded to Trieste, <lb/>
where they embarked on H.M.S. <hi rend="italic">Ariadne</hi> for Alexandria. <lb/>
Their Royal Highnesses went on to Cairo, and before <lb/>
starting on their journey up the Nile they witnessed the <lb/>
curious Procession of the Holy Carpet on its way to Mecca, <lb/>
and the departure of the pilgrims. One of the most <reg orig="inter-|esting">interesting</reg> <lb/>
episodes of this delightful tour was their visit to the <lb/>
Suez Canal, escorted by M. de Lesseps. At the end of March <lb/>
they returned to Alexandria, and once more embarked in <lb/>
the <hi rend="italic">Ariadne</hi>, arriving at Constantinople on April 1st, where <lb/>
they were received by the Sultan, and a suite of magnificent <lb/>
<pb n="183" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0202"/>
apartments were allotted them in the Salih Bazaar Palace, <lb/>
on the north side of the Bosphorus.</p>
<p>The Memoir gives a graphic account of this Oriental visit: <lb/>
"Then followed days which must have recalled to the <lb/>
Royal visitors some of the stories in the 'Arabian Nights.' <lb/>
The meals at the Salih Bazaar Palace were all served on <lb/>
gold and silver plate studded with gems. A band of <lb/>
eighty-four musicians played during dinner. Every <reg orig="morn-|ing">morning</reg> <lb/>
arrived gorgeous presents from the Sultan, including <lb/>
exquisite flowers, and trays laden with fruits and sweets; <lb/>
while, at a clap of the hand, black-coated chibouquejies <lb/>
brought in pipes and amber mouthpieces of fabulous value, <lb/>
crusted in diamonds and rubies. There was a complete <lb/>
Turkish bath establishment in the palace, and the slightest <lb/>
wish expressed by the Prince of Wales was considered an <lb/>
order.&hellip; The great event of their visit was a State dinner <lb/>
given by the Sultan to the Prince and Princess at the <lb/>
Dolma Baghtche Palace. This was the first banquet ever <lb/>
given by a Sultan of Turkey to Christians."</p>
<p>The Sultan also conducted the Princess and Mrs. Grey <lb/>
to his harem, where they spent an hour and a half. On <lb/>
April 10th their Royal Highnesses started for the Crimea, <lb/>
visiting the battlefields of Alma, Inkermann, and Balaclava; <lb/>
they also visited the simple house which had been Lord <lb/>
Raglan's head-quarters, and where he died. On the 20th <lb/>
the <hi rend="italic">Ariadne</hi> anchored at Athens, where the Princess and <lb/>
her husband had a warm welcome from her brother, King <lb/>
George; and during their stay at Corfu the Princess enjoyed <lb/>
a period of repose. On May 12th they were at home again <lb/>
at Marlborough House, after an absence of nearly six <lb/>
months. On November 26th, 1869, the Princess gave birth <lb/>
to her youngest daughter, Princess Maud.</p>

</epigraph>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Anxious</hi> days were coming to the peaceful home at <lb/>
Sandringham. On April 6th, 1870, the Princess' third <lb/>
son was born, and received the name of Alexander; but he <lb/>
only lived a few hours. In the little churchyard of St. <lb/>
Mary Magdalene, in Sandringham Park, there is a simple <lb/>
grassy mound, surrounded by gilt-iron railings, with a plain <lb/>
headstone recording the date of birth and death of the <lb/>
infant Prince, and the words, "Suffer the little children to <lb/>
come unto Me." In the November of this year, while <lb/>
Princess Alice was staying at Sandringham, the Prince of <lb/>
Wales was attacked by the insidious and terrible fever that <lb/>
ten years previously had brought his father to the grave.</p>
<p>The Prince's state soon became extremely critical, and <lb/>
his medical attendants, Doctors Jenner, Gull, Clayton, and <lb/>
Lowe, were very anxious. His Royal Highness was nursed <lb/>
with the utmost devotion by his wife and sister.</p>
<p>On the last day of November there was a semi-official <lb/>
notification: "The Princess of Wales has borne her great <lb/>
trial in the most admirable manner, and with singular <lb/>
<pb n="185" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0204"/>
equanimity. While fully aware of the gravity of the Prince's <lb/>
serious illness, Her Royal Highness has throughout been <lb/>
calm and collected."</p>
<p>"The feeling aroused throughout the United Kingdom," <lb/>
we are informed, "was far greater than any public expression <lb/>
of emotion since the death of Princess Charlotte in 1817." <lb/>
Prayers were offered up in churches of every communion, <lb/>
and, as the Prince's state became more critical, the Queen <lb/>
went down to Sandringham. On December 1st the Prince <lb/>
recovered consciousness, and his first remark was, "This <lb/>
is the Princess' birthday." This slight rally did not <reg orig="con-|tinue">continue</reg>, <lb/>
and soon the whole Royal family were summoned to <lb/>
Sandringham. By the 7th the fever had spent itself, but <lb/>
the Prince's strength seemed exhausted. Special prayers <lb/>
were to be offered up throughout the kingdom; and shortly <lb/>
before the service in St. Mary's Magdalene's, Sandringham, <lb/>
the Vicar received the following note from the Princess of <lb/>
Wales: "My husband being, thank God, somewhat better, <lb/>
I am coming to church. I must leave, I fear, before the <lb/>
service is concluded, that I may watch by his bedside. <lb/>
Can you not say a few words in prayer in the early part <lb/>
of the service, that I may join with you in prayer for my <lb/>
husband before I return to him?"</p>
<p>Could anything be more touching than these few simple <lb/>
words breathing a wife's devotion. The Memoir informs <lb/>
us that "the vicar, before reading the collect, in a voice <lb/>
trembling with emotion, which he vainly tried to suppress. <lb/>
said, 'The prayers of the congregation are earnestly sought <lb/>
for His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, who is now <lb/>
most seriously ill.'"</p>
<p>It was a weary time of suspense for the Princess, but <lb/>
the following day the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> remarked: "The Prince still <lb/>
lives, and we may still therefore hope"; and on the 16th <lb/>
the Prince enjoyed a quiet sleep. On the 17th, Sunday, <lb/>
at St. Mary Magdalene's, the Prince and his poor groom <lb/>
<pb n="186" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0205"/>
Blegge, who was lying at the point of death from the same <lb/>
terrible fever, were commended to the Divine mercy in the <lb/>
same prayer. Later that day the Princess visited the dying <lb/>
groom; and when he expired a few hours afterwards she <lb/>
and the Queen visited his relatives, and strove in the midst <lb/>
of their own trouble to comfort the poor people. By <lb/>
Christmas Day all danger was over, and on the 26th the <lb/>
Queen wrote to the nation:</p>
<p>"The Queen is very anxious to express her deep sense <lb/>
of the touching sympathy of the whole nation on the <lb/>
occasion of the alarming illness of her dear son the Prince <lb/>
of Wales. The universal feeling shown by her people <lb/>
during those painful terrible days, and the sympathy evinced <lb/>
by them with herself and her beloved daughter, the Princess <lb/>
of Wales, as well as the general joy at the improvement of <lb/>
the Prince of Wales' state, have made a deep and lasting <lb/>
impression on her heart, which will never be effaced.&hellip;"</p>
<p>There is an interesting passage in the "Memoir of the <lb/>
Prince of Wales." "The Princess of Wales and Princess <lb/>
Alice now felt that their patient was well enough for them <lb/>
to leave him for an hour or two, in order to assist at the <lb/>
distribution of Christmas gifts to the labourers on the <lb/>
estate." In the ceiling of the room now occupied by the <lb/>
Princess of Wales as a bed-chamber, the mark of an orifice <lb/>
may still be seen from which projected a hook supporting a <lb/>
trapeze, by the aid of which the Prince, when on the slow <lb/>
and weary road to convalescence, could change his position <lb/>
and pull himself into a sitting posture.</p>
<p>Another memento of the Prince's terrible illness is the <lb/>
brass lectern in the parish church. On it runs an inscription: <lb/>
<q><hi rend="small-caps">To The Glory Of God</hi>.</q>
<q><hi rend="small-caps">A Thank-Offering For His Mercy</hi>:</q>
<q><hi rend="small-caps">14th December</hi>, 1871.</q>
<q><hi rend="small-caps">Alexandra</hi>.</q>
<q>"When I was in trouble I called upon the Lord, and He heard me."</q>
</p>
<pb n="187" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0206"/>
<p>The great National Thanksgiving for the Prince of <lb/>
Wales' recovery was fixed for February 27th. The Queen <lb/>
and the Prince and Princess of Wales went in state to <lb/>
St. Paul's, where a solemn Te Deum was sung.</p>
<p>They received a splendid ovation. In the Green Park <lb/>
thirty thousand children sang the National Anthem, and <lb/>
enthusiastic crowds lined the route of procession. In the <lb/>
Queen's touching letter to her people, she says: "The <lb/>
Queen as well as her son and dear daughter-in-law felt that <lb/>
the whole nation joined with them in thanking God for <lb/>
sparing the beloved Prince of Wales' life."</p>
<p>The years passed on more or less eventfully; the Prince <lb/>
took up once more the thread of his public life. In <lb/>
January 1874 the Prince and Princess of Wales represented <lb/>
the Queen at the marriage of the Duke of Edinburgh with <lb/>
the Grand-Duchess Marie of Russia at St. Petersburg; and <lb/>
in 1875 the Prince started on his Indian tour.</p>
<p>There is a pleasant glimpse of the home life at <lb/>
Sandringham in a letter from Dr. Magee &lpar;then Bishop of <lb/>
Peterborough&rpar;, quoted in the Memoir: "I arrived just as <lb/>
they were all at tea in the entrance hall, and had to walk <lb/>
in, all dusty and dishevelled from my day's journey, and <lb/>
sit down by the Princess of Wales, with Disraeli on the <lb/>
other side of me, and sundry lords and ladies round the <lb/>
table. The Prince received me very kindly, and certainly <lb/>
has most winning and gracious manners. The Princess <lb/>
seems smaller and thinner than I remember her at Dublin. <lb/>
They seem to be pleasant and domesticated, with little <lb/>
state and very simple ways."</p>
<p>On the Sunday before the Prince started on his Indian <lb/>
tour, the whole family were at Westminster Abbey. A <lb/>
letter from Dean Stanley, quoted in the Memoir, gives an <lb/>
account of their visit to the Deanery:&mdash;</p>
<p>"They brought all the five children, 'wishing,' the Prince <lb/>
said, 'to have them with him as long as possible.' They <lb/>
<pb n="188" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0207"/>
all came up, and remained about twenty minutes. Fanny <lb/>
was in the back library, and the children, after being for <lb/>
a few minutes with Augusta, who was delighted to see <lb/>
them, went to her. The Prince and Princess remained with <lb/>
Augusta and me. A. talked with her usual animation. <lb/>
They were both extremely kind. The Princess looked <lb/>
inexpressibly sad.&hellip; I took the Prince downstairs; he <lb/>
spoke of the dangers, but calmly and rationally, saying that, <lb/>
of course, the precautions must be left to those about him. <lb/>
I said to him, 'I gave you my parting benediction in the <lb/>
Abbey yesterday.' 'Yes,' he replied, 'I saw it: thank you.'"</p>
<p>Two days after his arrival in India the Prince celebrated <lb/>
his thirty-fourth birthday; and the first thing that met his <lb/>
eyes that morning was a beautiful picture of the Princess, <lb/>
specially entrusted to Sir Bartle Frere. On the Prince's <lb/>
return home the following April, the Princess and the <lb/>
Royal children met him at Yarmouth; and the Sunday <lb/>
afterwards they attended Divine Service at Westminster <lb/>
Abbey, when special thanksgiving for the Prince's safe <lb/>
return were solemnly offered up.</p>
<p>The simple home life at Sandringham was now resumed, <lb/>
and the years passed on. In 1878 the Prince lost his <lb/>
beloved sister, Princess Alice; this was felt most acutely <lb/>
by both the Prince and Princess. The link between <lb/>
Princess Alice and her brother had always been peculiarly <lb/>
strong, and she had never visited England without paying <lb/>
long visits at Sandringham or Marlborough House.</p>
<p>In 1880 the Marchioness of Waterford, in a letter from <lb/>
Highcliffe, writes: "I have had a great surprise in the <lb/>
unexpected visit of the Prince and Princess of Wales, with <lb/>
their two sons and the three little princesses lunching on the <lb/>
beach, coming up to tea, and drawing nets on the shore <lb/>
till evening, the young princes, swimming about in flannels, <lb/>
and finally the Prince and two sons swimming away to <lb/>
join the steam tug.&hellip; It was such a gay scene, and <lb/>
<pb n="189" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0208"/>
Highcliffe looked its very best. The nets, and the people <lb/>
in flannels rollicking in the sea, and the boats and the <lb/>
sailors, were a series of lovely pictures; and then the <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Osborne's</hi> boats of dark blue-and-gold bands, and the sailors <lb/>
holding up their oars&mdash;it was quite a beautiful effect.&hellip; <lb/>
The Princess looked very pretty in a dark jersey with some <lb/>
red about it."</p>
<p>In 1887 the Queen's First Jubilee was celebrated; <lb/>
and in 1888 the Prince and Princess kept their Silver <lb/>
Wedding. The Queen gave a State Ball at Buckingham <lb/>
Palace in honour of the event, and the King and Queen <lb/>
of Denmark gave one also at the Amalienborg Palace at <lb/>
Copenhagen. Dr. Magee preached at Whitehall before <lb/>
the Prince and Princess and the Royal family.</p>
<p>Presents poured in on the Royal couple. The Prince <lb/>
gave his wife a cross of diamonds and rubies, her favourite <lb/>
jewels; and from St. Petersburg, as a joint gift of the <lb/>
Emperor and Empress of Russia, came a superb necklace <lb/>
of the same gems, composed of carefully selected stones. <lb/>
The five children of the Princess gave her a silver model <lb/>
of "Viva," her favourite mare. The Princess' eight <reg orig="brides-|maids">bridesmaids</reg>, <lb/>
who were all alive and all married, gave the Royal <lb/>
Bride of 1863 their autographs bound up in a silver book <lb/>
enshrined in a silver casket of Danish work. The <reg orig="magnifi-|cent">magnificent</reg> <lb/>
presents received by the Prince and Princess on this <lb/>
occasion were arranged in the Indian Room at Marlborough <lb/>
House.</p>
<p>The serious illness of the Emperor Frederick cast a deep <lb/>
shadow over these festivities, and on June 14th the dreaded <lb/>
blow fell, and the Emperor breathed his last, after a reign of <lb/>
ninety-nine days.</p>
<p>The next important event in the Princess' life was the <lb/>
marriage of her eldest daughter to the Duke of Fife. <lb/>
The wedding was celebrated in the Chapel at Buckingham <lb/>
Palace, July 27th, 1889, and in the following May Lady <lb/>
<pb n="190" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0209"/>
Alexandra Duff was born, and the Princess became a <lb/>
grandmother.</p>
<p>It has been said that the month of December has been <lb/>
one of ill omen to the Royal family, and it was greatly feared <lb/>
that this would prove true in 1891. The Princess and her <lb/>
daughters were on a visit to the Tsar in Sweden, when they <lb/>
were recalled by the illness of Prince George, who was <lb/>
declared to be suffering from enteric fever. He was removed <lb/>
from Sandringham to London, but the serious nature of the <lb/>
Prince's illness was not publicly realised until, happily, the <lb/>
danger was over.</p>
<p>Immediately on the convalescence of the Duke of York, <lb/>
the engagement of the Duke of Clarence and Avondale to <lb/>
Princess Victoria Mary of Teck was publicly announced. <lb/>
The news was received with great approval by the nation. <lb/>
The history of that brief engagement, and the young Prince's <lb/>
short and fatal illness, is still fresh in every memory. The <lb/>
Prince had caught a severe cold at the funeral of Prince <lb/>
Victor of Hohenlohe-Langenburg. On January 9th, 1892, <lb/>
while spending the Christmas holidays at Sandringham, an <lb/>
attack of influenza supervened, the fever ran high, and <lb/>
within a week the young Prince breathed his last.</p>
<p>The mournful tidings threw a gloom over the whole winter, <lb/>
and deep was the sympathy felt for the heart-broken parents <lb/>
and his young betrothed. The tie between the mother and <lb/>
son had been unusually strong, and the Princess had been <lb/>
almost crushed under the blow. Amongst the touching <lb/>
letters received from all parts of the world, we are informed <lb/>
that one of those most valued was from the Zulu chiefs at <lb/>
St. Helena, conveyed through Miss Colenso: "We have <lb/>
heard of the death of Prince Edward, the son of the Prince <lb/>
of Wales. We lament sincerely. Pray you, present our <lb/>
lamentation to them all&mdash;to his grandmother, to his father <lb/>
and his mother and his brother."</p>

message to the nation. "The Prince and Princess of Wales <lb/>
are anxious to express to Her Majesty's subjects, whether in <lb/>
the United Kingdom, in the Colonies, or India, the sense <lb/>
of their deep gratitude for the universal feeling of sympathy <lb/>
manifested towards them at a time when they are <reg orig="over-|whelmed">overwhelmed</reg> <lb/>
by the terrible calamity which they have sustained <lb/>
in the loss of their beloved eldest son. If sympathy at such <lb/>
a moment is of any avail, the remembrance that their grief <lb/>
has been shared by all classes will be a lasting consolation <lb/>
to their sorrowing hearts, and, if possible, will make them <lb/>
more attached than ever to their dear country."</p>
<p>After their son's death the Prince and Princess retired <lb/>
into strict privacy, but 1893 brought the bereaved parents <lb/>
fresh duties and interests. In May the betrothal of their <lb/>
second son, the Duke of York, to Princess Victoria Mary <lb/>
of Teck, was officially announced, and the wedding was <lb/>
solemnised on July 6th in the Chapel Royal, St. James's; <lb/>
and three years later Princess Maud of Wales was married <lb/>
to Prince Charles of Denmark.</p>
<p>The public life of the Princess of Wales is too well known <lb/>
to need repetition here. Her beauty, her charm of manner, <lb/>
her kindly courtesy and winsome <hi rend="italic">bonhomie</hi>, have long been <lb/>
the admiration and love of the nation. Even now one <lb/>
recalls the speech of the fair young Princess in the Forest <lb/>
of Bernstorff, "and I should like best to be loved," for most <lb/>
assuredly this wish has been verified.</p>
<p>But, although people are familiar with the Princess' <lb/>
sweet looks and winning ways, perhaps they hardly realise <lb/>
the real simplicity of her daily home life, and that deeper <lb/>
side of her nature known only to those in her immediate <lb/>
environment.</p>
<p>An intense sympathy with the sick and suffering is a <lb/>
predominant feature of her character. When Mrs. Jones, <lb/>
who nursed the Princess in her long illness in 1867, fell ill, <lb/>
Her Royal Highness insisted on sitting up with her some <lb/>
<pb n="192" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0213"/>
nights until the end came. A monument in Brompton <lb/>
cemetery bears this inscription: <lb/>
<q>"In memory of Elizabeth Jones, who died May 13th, 1881. For <lb/>
14 years the faithful servant and friend of Alexandra, Princess of <lb/>
Wales, by whom this monument is erected."</q></p>
<p>There is another act of thoughtfulness verified by high <lb/>
authority.</p>
<p>After the Duke of Clarence's death, when numerous <lb/>
special services were held at the Memorial Chapel, Windsor, <lb/>
Her Royal Highness had begged for another service late <lb/>
in the evening before she left Windsor.</p>
<p>In spite of her sorrow she thought of the fourteen little <lb/>
choir boys who might be sent supperless to bed, and herself <lb/>
gave orders that chickens and other good things should be <lb/>
sent to their residence in the cloisters; and as the <lb/>
lads expressed it, in boy language, "they had a jolly good <lb/>
feed." This anecdote is related in "Marlborough House <lb/>
and its Occupants." The Princess is an excellent speaker, <lb/>
and knows how to say the right thing at the right moment; <lb/>
but it is at her beloved home, Sandringham, that the <lb/>
Princess indulges her special philanthropic propensities.</p>
<p>The Princess and her daughters visit the cottages and <lb/>
schools on the estate, and take a great deal of interest in <lb/>
the children. Sandringham is certainly a model place, for <lb/>
in the five villages on the Prince's estate there is not one <lb/>
public-house. In the charming <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italic">ch&acirc;let</hi></foreign> which is used as a <lb/>
model dairy, and where afternoon tea is often served, there <lb/>
is a piece of humble pottery in the shape of an earthenware <lb/>
jug, which had been presented to the Princess by a young <lb/>
girl, who died of consumption, in gratitude for the kindly <lb/>
attentions shown her by the Royal lady. The Princess' <lb/>
kindness of heart is known to the very tramps, and her <lb/>
benevolence and generosity are so widespread that she is <lb/>
the subject of endless appeals. By her servants and <reg orig="house-|hold">household</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="193" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0214"/>
she is greatly beloved, and we are told "that she has <lb/>
a kind word for everybody; and if, when in going out, she <lb/>
passes through the offices at Marlborough House, she never <lb/>
fails to bestow a smile of recognition and a word of inquiry <lb/>
upon each and all of the messengers and commissionaires <lb/>
who happen to be in the way." At Sandringham she is <lb/>
constantly in the cottages, and walks about the lanes <lb/>
unattended or with Miss Knollys.</p>
<p>She is passionately fond of horses, and pays daily visits <lb/>
to her pony stables. Bina, Merry-Antics, Bow, and Bell <lb/>
are the occupiers of this pretty building. Since the death <lb/>
of the Duke of Clarence, her favourite, Vera, has not been <lb/>
so much used; but is still visited and petted by her mistress. <lb/>
The Princess is also devoted to dogs. The kennels at <lb/>
Sandringham are quite as fine as the stables, and there is a <lb/>
dog hospital and nursery attached to them. The Princess <lb/>
has numerous other pets&mdash;Persian cats, doves, Australian <lb/>
pigeons, a Barbary dove, and some fine water-fowl&mdash;and, <lb/>
last but not least, Cockie, her cockatoo, who is said to be <lb/>
over a hundred years old.</p>
<p>As every Englishwoman knows, the Princess of Wales <lb/>
excels in needlework, and has a penchant for millinery. <lb/>
As a rule, she designs her own dresses; she is also a <lb/>
collector of old lace. Her Royal Highness takes great <lb/>
interest in domestic industries. At Sandringham she has <lb/>
practically created the Alexandra Technical School, and <lb/>
maintains it out of her privy purse.</p>
<p>The Princess loves to superintend the toilettes of her <lb/>
daughters, and to give little finishing touches. As a young <lb/>
mother, nothing delighted her more than to don a large <lb/>
flannel apron, and bathe her little ones herself. Amongst <lb/>
her other good works, the Princess has always taken a great <lb/>
interest in "The Royal National Pension Fund for Nurses," <lb/>
and has herself designed the armlet worn by the nurses.</p>
<p>In July, 1895, the Princess gave certificates to the hospital <lb/>
<pb n="194" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0215"/>
nurses, at Marlborough House. Tea was provided for them <lb/>
in a large marquee, and at the close of the entertainment <lb/>
the Princess performed one of those graceful little acts <lb/>
which make her so beloved. Handing a spray of lovely <lb/>
flowers to one of the nurses, she graciously intimated that <lb/>
others might help themselves, and the floral decorations <lb/>
were speedily cleared. Well might the Chairman of the <lb/>
Royal Free Hospital say in his speech "that they were glad <lb/>
to place the name of Alexandra in the final section of that <lb/>
great institution in remembrance of a royal, gentle, and <lb/>
gracious Princess, whose nobility of character, kindness of <lb/>
heart, and tender sympathy for the sick and suffering poor, <lb/>
was known not only to them, but to the whole world."</p>
<p>At Sandringham Sundays are spent very quietly, and <lb/>
household and servants are spared unnecessary duties. At <lb/>
the hour of Divine Service the Royal hosts and their guests <lb/>
wend their way through the park to the little church of <lb/>
St Mary Magdalene. The interior of the church is small, <lb/>
and will only seat about a hundred people. There is no <lb/>
surpliced choir, but one recruited from the children of <lb/>
the Royal School and the ranks of grooms and gardeners. <lb/>
Much care is bestowed on their training, and the singing <lb/>
is decidedly good. The afternoon is quietly spent in the <lb/>
house or park. The Prince and Princess often visit the <lb/>
kennels and stables, or wander round the gardens, or to the <lb/>
Model Dairy. Afternoon tea is either served here or in the <lb/>
Grand Saloon. Then the company disperse until the <reg orig="half-|past">half-past</reg> <lb/>
seven o'clock dinner. Sometimes the Prince and <lb/>
Princess attend Evening Service in one of the village <lb/>
churches near. When this happens to be the case we are <lb/>
told that the front pews are reserved for the Royal party, <lb/>
and that the Princess chooses the hymns. "Lead, kindly <lb/>
Light" is one of her greatest favourites.</p>
<p>There is one thing worthy of special note. The railway <lb/>
station some two miles from Sandringham, where the Royal <lb/>
<pb n="195" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0216"/>
Family have their own waiting-room, is always closed on <lb/>
Sunday, as no train whatever is run on that day. Indeed, <lb/>
no unnecessary work is performed on Sunday in any part of <lb/>
the Prince's estate. In the evening there is often good <lb/>
sacred music, or the best modern music is played, as well <lb/>
as Beethoven and Mozart.</p>
<p>When the Princess is in Denmark she attends the Danish <lb/>
Service, so dear to her; or visits the pretty English church <lb/>
in Copenhagen, in the erection of which Her Royal <reg orig="High-|ness">Highness</reg> <lb/>
was mainly instrumental.</p>
<p>In this, as well as in her kindly hospitality, her womanly <lb/>
sympathies, and royal grace, our Beloved Princess still sets <lb/>
a noble example, and still earns her title as "Queen of <lb/>
Hearts."</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> present age, as we have remarked elsewhere, is <lb/>
prolific of biographies and autobiographies. The <lb/>
hero-worship inherent in human nature demands to have <lb/>
its curiosity satiated; in its mistaken zeal even the sanctity <lb/>
of the home is invaded, and the open sesame rashly spoken <lb/>
makes the closed doors one by one fly open.</p>
<p>As in the days of old the Athenians "spent their time in <lb/>
nothing else but either to tell or to hear some new thing," <lb/>
so even in these modern days there are still babblers and <lb/>
loiterers in the market-place, searching out curious <reg orig="psycho-|logical">psychological</reg> <lb/>
questions, and weighing motives, or talking glibly of <lb/>
character and environment. No problem is too difficult <lb/>
to solve, if one has only leisure and perseverance. To shy, <lb/>
retiring natures this absence of all reticence is felt as a <lb/>
positive martyrdom; it is as though one walked in tropical <lb/>
sunshine in the full blaze of the noonday, without shelter <lb/>
of any kind. Nothing could be more distasteful than this <lb/>
publicity to the humble individual striving to do his duty <lb/>
in the state of life to which God has called him, and more <lb/>
<pb n="200" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0221"/>
anxious to satisfy his conscience than to win the plaudits of <lb/>
his fellows. Some minds are so constituted that to them <lb/>
truth is the one thing to be desired, the whole truth and <lb/>
nothing but the truth, and herein lies the difficulty. How <lb/>
is any one to interpret truly the mind of another? "Know <lb/>
thyself," says the sage; and yet even here interpretation has <lb/>
its limits. As Amiel justly remarks in that wonderful <lb/>
journal of his: "How many times we become hypocrites <lb/>
simply by remaining the same outwardly and towards others <lb/>
when we know that inwardly and to ourselves we are <lb/>
different. It is not hypocrisy in the strict sense, for we <lb/>
borrow no other personality than our own; still it is a kind <lb/>
of deception." If, according to Amiel, it be so difficult to <lb/>
know ourselves, it can surely be no easy task when we touch <lb/>
other people's lives, when we deal with the complex <reg orig="person-|ality">personality</reg> <lb/>
of some great worker or thinker to whom we passionately <lb/>
desire to do full justice.</p>
<p>With those born in the purple there is greater scope: <lb/>
they have lived in public from their birth, and their features, <lb/>
and even their idiosyncrasies, are in a way familiar to us.</p>
<p>As a nation the English people are remarkably <reg orig="con-|servative">conservative</reg> <lb/>
in their attachments; they have their favourites <lb/>
to whom they offer their homage; and paramount among <lb/>
these we must place the name of the late lamented Princess <lb/>
Mary Adelaide, Duchess of Teck.</p>
<p>At all public functions the bright, winsome face of <lb/>
Princess Mary always met with cordial welcome. "Our <lb/>
Mary" has been more than once her title, and there are <lb/>
few people who cannot recall her beaming smile. Up to <lb/>
the present time there has been no memoir forthcoming of <lb/>
this royal lady, although there is little doubt that one will <lb/>
shortly appear; and the writer of this brief sketch is largely <lb/>
indebted to the charming articles written by Mrs. Tooley <lb/>
in the <hi rend="italic">Woman at Home</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Girl's Realm</hi>, and also to <lb/>
other character-sketches.</p>
<pb n="201" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0222"/>
<p>Her Royal Highness Princess Mary Adelaide was the <lb/>
youngest daughter of the Duke of Cambridge, the youngest <lb/>
and favourite son of George III. Her mother was Augusta, <lb/>
daughter of Frederick, Landgrave of Hesse. The Duke, <lb/>
who acted as Viceroy of Hanover until the death of <lb/>
William IV., resided in that country for some years, and it <lb/>
was at the Viceregal Palace in Hanover that his youngest <lb/>
daughter was born, November 27th, 1833, and where she <lb/>
passed the first four years of her childhood. On the <lb/>
accession of Queen Victoria to the throne, the Duke of <lb/>
Cambridge and his family returned to England, where the <lb/>
little Princess soon became a great favourite.</p>
<p>"Her first introduction into public life," Mrs. Tooley <lb/>
tells us, "was at the Queen's wedding, when she stood <lb/>
beside her mother throughout the ceremony. In a <reg orig="well-|known">well-known</reg> <lb/>
picture of the Royal marriage, Princess Mary is a <lb/>
charming figure in her white frock, and a shower of golden <lb/>
curls falling down to her waist." At that time Princess <lb/>
Mary was not far from the succession, although her childish <lb/>
mind would not have grasped this fact.</p>
<p>The Duchess of Cambridge was a devoted and <reg orig="con-|scientious">conscientious</reg> <lb/>
mother, and the little Princess was most carefully <lb/>
watched and educated. The Duchess inculcated habits of <lb/>
economy, and was extremely anxious that when her young <lb/>
daughter went out for her daily walks with her governess <lb/>
she should acknowledge the greetings of the passers-by with <lb/>
grace and affability. Princess Mary loved music, and sang <lb/>
beautifully; she shared this taste with her mother and sister <lb/>
Augusta, who afterward became the Duchess of Mecklen <lb/>
burg-Strelitz.</p>
<p>When Princess Mary was about twenty she lost her father. <lb/>
After his death she and her widowed mother lived chiefly <lb/>
at Cambridge Cottage, "a long, low, rambling old house, <lb/>
picturesquely situated close to Kew Green, and having lovely <lb/>
gardens which practically joined the Royal Botanical Gardens."</p>
<pb n="202" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0223"/>
<p>Here Princess Mary seems to have led a tranquil life, <lb/>
busy with her flowers and music, and visiting constantly <lb/>
her poorer neighbours. The widowed Duchess and her <lb/>
daughter took the deepest interest in all institutions for the <lb/>
relief of the widows and orphans of soldiers, and especially <lb/>
in the Royal Cambridge Asylum at Kingston, built in <lb/>
memory of the late Duke of Cambridge.</p>
<p>There were many suitors for Princess Mary's hand. Prince <lb/>
Jerome Buonaparte was one. Mrs. Tooley quotes an entry <lb/>
in the Earl of Malmesbury's diary: "Lord Henry Lennox <lb/>
arrived, said by the French to have come on a mission to <lb/>
propose a marriage between young Jerome and Princess <lb/>
Mary of Cambridge. I hope this is not true, for the sake <lb/>
of Her Royal Highness, for whom I have great respect and <lb/>
admiration." This offer was declined. The Emperor <lb/>
Napoleon was the next on the list, but the Princess was <lb/>
unwilling to marry out of her own country.</p>
<p>The Duchess of Cambridge and her daughter were fond <lb/>
of Brighton, and generally spent a short time there every <lb/>
autumn. It was during a review there that a handsome <lb/>
young foreigner, who accompanied the Prince of Wales, <lb/>
attracted universal attention. This was no other than <lb/>
Francis, Prince Teck. He was an officer who had seen <lb/>
active service in the Austro-Italian War. We learn from <lb/>
one article that the Prince was a descendant of the ancient <lb/>
Kings of Wurtemberg, and connected on his mother's side <lb/>
with a noble Hungarian family. He also traced his ancestry <lb/>
back to George II. Their betrothal soon followed, and on <lb/>
June 12th, 1866, Princess Mary married the Duke of <lb/>
Teck at Kew church, the Queen being present at the <reg orig="cere-|mony">ceremony</reg>. <lb/>
There is one pathetic little incident connected with <lb/>
the wedding-day which we must quote. We are told, "the <lb/>
silken carpet upon which she had knelt to solemnise her <lb/>
marriage vows was treasured by the Duchess of Teck under <lb/>
lock and key until the day of her death, and, in fulfilment <lb/>
<pb n="203" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0224"/>
of her wish, was placed by her heart-broken husband over <lb/>
her coffin."</p>
<p>A suite of apartments had been allotted to the wedded <lb/>
pair at Kensington Palace, and here the first sixteen years <lb/>
of Princess Mary's married life were spent. There all <lb/>
her children were born&mdash;Princess May, Prince Adolphus <lb/>
&lpar;who afterwards married Lady Margaret Grosvenor&rpar;, Prince <lb/>
Francis, and Prince Alexander. Then for a time the Duke <lb/>
and Duchess of Teck and their children resided abroad, <lb/>
chiefly at Florence, and on their return to England they <lb/>
took up their abode at the White Lodge in Richmond Park. <lb/>
This pleasant country house was built for Queen Caroline, <lb/>
the wife of George II., and it is generally supposed to be the <lb/>
surroundings of the White Lodge which Sir Walter Scott <reg orig="de-|scribes">describes</reg> <lb/>
in "The Heart of Midlothian," in the touching scene <lb/>
where brave Jeanie Deans entreats a pardon for her <reg orig="con-|demned">condemned</reg> <lb/>
sister from Queen Caroline. The passage from <lb/>
which we glean this information is worthy of quotation:</p>
<p>"But Jeanie, when her attention was drawn to the <lb/>
unrivalled landscape of fertile meadows, quiet vales, and <lb/>
limitless billows of undulating greensward to be seen from <lb/>
the eminence on which White Lodge stands, said, with true <lb/>
Scottish satisfaction, 'I like just as weel to look on the crags <lb/>
of Arthur's Seat, and the sea coming in ayont them, as at <lb/>
a' thae muckle trees,' and she expressed her opinion that <lb/>
White Lodge was more like a gentleman's house than a <lb/>
royal palace, which is certainly true." It contained, <reg orig="how-|ever">however</reg>, <lb/>
an interesting collection of historic pictures; and, <lb/>
though the gardens of the Lodge are not extensive, they <lb/>
were beautifully arranged and carefully tended by the Duke <lb/>
of Teck and Princess Mary.</p>
<p>It was certainly a happy home at the White Lodge. <lb/>
The Duchess of Teck was a devoted mother, and her <lb/>
children adored her. In reading of the girlhood of the <lb/>
Princess May one is struck by the close companionship <lb/>
<pb n="204" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0225"/>
between the mother and daughter. They seem to have <lb/>
shared the same tastes and to have worked together in their <lb/>
charitable and philanthropic schemes. On warm summer <lb/>
days they might have been seen sitting at work in a favourite <lb/>
verandah, making garments for the poor, the Duchess busy <lb/>
with her knitting and crochet, which she preferred to sewing.</p>
<p>The mistress of the White Lodge was very womanly <lb/>
and domestic. She was fond of her home. She and her <lb/>
husband did not entertain largely, but in an informal way <lb/>
they dispensed hospitality. Their friends and relatives <lb/>
often came to spend a few hours with them on Sundays. <lb/>
The Prince of Wales was a frequent visitor, and the marriage <lb/>
of her only daughter to the Duke of York was a source of <lb/>
great happiness to the Duchess. The birth of her first <lb/>
grandchild, Prince Edward, under her roof, was a joy to <lb/>
her affectionate heart.</p>
<p>In her earlier life the Duchess had devoted a good deal <lb/>
of time to music and singing. Having travelled a good <lb/>
deal she was also an accomplished linguist, and spoke <lb/>
French and German as perfectly as her native tongue. The <lb/>
family at the White Lodge set a good example to the <reg orig="neigh-|bourhood">neighbourhood</reg>. <lb/>
They were most regular in their attendance at <lb/>
Divine worship, and might be seen Sunday after Sunday <lb/>
at the little church at Kingston Vale, not far from the Robin <lb/>
Hood Gates of Richmond Park.</p>
<p>The Duchess of Teck's devotion to good works is well <lb/>
known; it was the chief object of her life. Countless <lb/>
requests for her presence at some public function reached <lb/>
her by nearly every post; petitions to open bazaars, fairs, <lb/>
public institutions of all kinds. Her energy was <reg orig="marvel-|lous">marvellous</reg>, <lb/>
and her interest untiring. She was extremely fond of <lb/>
reading, but in her unselfishness she sacrificed her personal <lb/>
enjoyment, and laid her books aside for her work.</p>
<p>It would be tedious even to enumerate the various <reg orig="insti-|tutions">institutions</reg> <lb/>
with which the Duchess was connected.</p>
<pb n="205" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0226"/>
<p>She was the patroness of a Village Home at Addlestone, <lb/>
Surrey, which is called after her, "Princess Mary's Home," <lb/>
while the Princess Mary Adelaide Training Home at <reg orig="Rich-|mond">Richmond</reg>, <lb/>
the Cambridge Asylum, St. Monica's Hospital, and the <lb/>
Victoria Hospital for Children, with many others, received <lb/>
much attention from her. From her girlhood the Duchess <lb/>
had taken special interest in the Royal Cambridge Asylum, <lb/>
Kingston. Each year the old women received supplies <lb/>
of fresh vegetables from the gardens of White Lodge, <lb/>
which were distributed by the Duchess and Princess May.</p>
<p>The Duchess, who was full of fun and loved a joke, was <lb/>
always very merry on these occasions, and would banter <lb/>
the Princess in a playful manner, to the great amusement <lb/>
of the old women.</p>
<p>But the London Needlework Guild was her favourite <lb/>
charity. This admirable Society was first started by Lady <lb/>
Wolverton. Some years previously Lady Wolverton, being <lb/>
in need of children's garments for her orphanage at Iwerne <lb/>
in Dorsetshire, set her friends to help her, as the matron of <lb/>
the orphanage had told her "that the garments made by the <lb/>
ladies lasted twice as long as bought ones." The next step <lb/>
may be described in Lady Wolverton's own words, quoted <lb/>
by the writer of the article in <hi rend="italic">The Young Woman</hi>: "It then <lb/>
occurred to me for the first time that there must be hundreds <lb/>
of women in England working aimlessly, and, on the other <lb/>
hand, there were thousands of men, women, and children <lb/>
wanting clothes. If only a little bridge could be thrown <lb/>
over from the Island of Waste to the Island of Want, how <lb/>
both would benefit!"</p>
<p>By the help of a paragraph in the London and provincial <lb/>
papers the Needlework Guild was started, and in eleven <lb/>
years grew into a mighty institution under its patroness <lb/>
H.R.H. Princess Mary Adelaide, Duchess of Teck.</p>
<p>The rules of the Guild are very simple. Each member is <lb/>
bound to contribute annually two useful articles of clothing. <lb/>
<pb n="206" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0227"/>
"These garments," as Lady Wolverton remarked, "being <lb/>
thus the free gifts to our Society, we freely give them <lb/>
to our applicants, heads of hospitals, missions, prisons, <lb/>
secretaries of every charity that asks for help, ministers of <lb/>
religion of every creed." In the report of December 1891 <lb/>
the year's work is represented by no less than 39,046 articles.</p>
<p>This charity was very dear to the Duchess's benevolent <lb/>
heart. Once she wrote from White Lodge: "We are still <lb/>
hard at work with our Guild work, and have already sent <lb/>
out from here forty-two grants. This is beautiful; don't <lb/>
you think so?"</p>
<p>There is a very vivid and interesting description of a <lb/>
visit of inspection made by a number of the lady workers, <lb/>
by special invitation of the Royal president.</p>
<p>There is a graphic description of the large basement room <lb/>
at the White Lodge, heaped up to the ceiling with the bales <lb/>
of clothing. "Outside, the leafless oaks were tossing their <lb/>
bare branches in the icy blast, while the snow pelted <reg orig="noise-|lessly">noiselessly</reg> <lb/>
against the window. The visitors were unable to <lb/>
remain many minutes in the room, as a fire was impossible <lb/>
with all those thousands of garments piled up. <reg orig="Neverthe-|less">Nevertheless</reg>," <lb/>
the writer goes on, "the Duchess of Teck stood near <lb/>
the door in the chilly room, into which every new visitor <lb/>
imported another draught of the damp, icy outside air, for <lb/>
two long hours, with a kind word of greeting to every one, <lb/>
with explanations to whoever wished to be instructed <reg orig="con-|cerning">concerning</reg> <lb/>
the work and objects of the Guild, and with never <lb/>
so much as a look of weariness to show that this was not <lb/>
the most enviable position in the world."</p>
<p>It is deeply interesting to know that Princess May was <lb/>
her mother's right hand, and worked hard for the <reg orig="Needle-|work">Needlework</reg> <lb/>
Guild. When the time approached for distribution <lb/>
she would toil all day long in making up parcels of clothing <lb/>
and addressing them. After her marriage, the Duchess of <lb/>
York always went to the White Lodge to assist in preparing <lb/>
<pb n="207" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0228"/>
the Guild work for distribution. There is a pathetic <lb/>
passage in the sketch in <hi rend="italic">The Girls' Realm</hi> that touches on <lb/>
this; for Princess May was thus engaged when the Duchess <lb/>
of Teck was seized with her fatal illness. "All day," we <lb/>
read, "mother and daughter had been busy sorting and <lb/>
labelling parcels, and at tea-time the Duchess complained of <lb/>
feeling ill. At dinner she decided not to go to the theatre <lb/>
that evening as arranged, and Princess May said to her <lb/>
father, who wished her to accompany him, 'I think it will <lb/>
be best for me to stay with mother.' That evening was the <lb/>
last that they were destined to spend together."</p>
<p>The Duchess' kindness of heart was proverbial, and there <lb/>
are numerous little instances of this. "When Princess <lb/>
Mary gave us the tea and sugar," one old woman said, "she <lb/>
always gave your hand a bit of a squeeze&mdash;so kind like." <lb/>
Many ladies in the neighbourhood were honoured with her <lb/>
private friendship. "I shall always think of her as a dear, <lb/>
good friend," observed one lady. "&hellip; I have often said <lb/>
that if one wanted something to cheer and elevate your <lb/>
spirits there was nothing like a visit to White Lodge."</p>
<p>Another lady, who had been in close contact with the <lb/>
Duchess for many years, and had worked hard for the <lb/>
Needlework Guild, told the writer of this sketch of the <lb/>
warm welcome that always awaited her, of the tender <lb/>
reverence paid by Princess May to her age and infirmity&mdash; <lb/>
how she traversed the rooms of the White Lodge, leaning <lb/>
on the strong young arm so gracefully offered her; and of <lb/>
the frank affectionate greeting of the Duchess seated at <lb/>
her tea-table. "You must sit next mamma," whispers the <lb/>
Princess; "she loves to have you there." No wonder the <lb/>
Duchess was so beloved; her tact and wide sympathies <lb/>
drew hearts to her.</p>
<p>Amongst her numerous charities she took a great interest <lb/>
in the Distressed Irish Ladies' Fund, and would try and <lb/>
persuade her friends to buy Irish linens and poplins. <lb/>
<pb n="208" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0229"/>
"Remember you can get as good silk at Spitalfields as <lb/>
abroad," she would say; for the promotion of British and <lb/>
Irish industries was her special hobby, and it is worthy of <lb/>
note that all Princess May's silk dresses were manufactured <lb/>
at Spitalfields.</p>
<p>In a short Memoir that appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> after <lb/>
Princess Mary's death, there are some interesting <reg orig="par-|ticulars">particulars</reg> <lb/>
of her life. We read "that she was remarkable for <lb/>
her personal beauty in her younger days, and was thought <lb/>
to be one of the most vigorous and robust of her family, <lb/>
though in later years she grew very stout." And again: <lb/>
"She was buoyant in temperament but subject to fits of <lb/>
depression, which, as a rule, she endeavoured to ward off <lb/>
by occupation. She was a hard worker, and could not <lb/>
tolerate idleness in others, and it was a sore trial when her <lb/>
physician advised her to restrict the number of her public <lb/>
engagements."</p>
<p>"I feel I am here to do a little good," she remarked to <lb/>
an intimate friend, "and I will do it as long as I am able." <lb/>
To quote from the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>: "She was a great walker, and <lb/>
knew every corner of Richmond Park, exploring it in all <lb/>
weathers, and keeping up at a good pace.&hellip; When the <lb/>
Duchess was in the enjoyment of ordinary health, and there <lb/>
was no preoccupation, her day was usually marked out on <lb/>
the following lines:&mdash;Rose at 8.30, breakfasted, dealt with <lb/>
correspondence till midday, walked in the park, visited <lb/>
or attended some public function in the afternoon, returned <lb/>
to White Lodge, dined, and engaged in organising and <lb/>
other work until midnight or later. Even before her <lb/>
serious illness this plan had to be modified, and she was <lb/>
induced to remain in her room until nearly noon, and to <lb/>
dictate almost all instead of personally answering her large <lb/>
correspondence."</p>
<p>Another interesting fact, and one perhaps little known, is <lb/>
also recorded, that the Duchess of Teck always spent in <lb/>
<pb n="209" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0230"/>
charity at least one-fifth of the annual allowance of &pound;5000 <lb/>
granted her by Parliament. After the Duchess' death a <lb/>
letter was sent to the editor of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, which was as <lb/>
follows:</p>
<p>"<hi rend="small-caps">Sir</hi>,&mdash;Allow me to send you an anecdote of our late <lb/>
lamented Princess Mary, Duchess of Teck. On a brief <lb/>
visit to Lord Sefton, at Croxteth, Her Royal Highness <lb/>
visited the Hospital for Women at Liverpool, without any <lb/>
formality. She wished to see it as it was. Her Royal <lb/>
Highness went through the wards, speaking to every <lb/>
woman, and handing her a little bouquet. On leaving one <lb/>
ward she inquired why one woman was crying so bitterly, <lb/>
and on being informed that she was about to undergo a <lb/>
serious operation, Her Royal Highness exclaimed, 'I will <lb/>
go to her, I will go to her again and try to comfort her.' <lb/>
She hurried back to the patient's bed, and was seen for <lb/>
some minutes holding a whispered conversation, whilst <lb/>
stroking the poor toilworn hand. Turning away, wiping her <lb/>
eyes, the Princess said, 'I wish to be kept informed how <lb/>
that patient goes on.' On reaching the hall of the Hospital <lb/>
Her Royal Highness made some laughing inquiry into the <lb/>
presence of 'a man' in the hospital; she was told it was <lb/>
the poor patient's husband, who was in great grief. The <lb/>
Royal lady said, 'I will speak to him. Where can I go to <lb/>
speak to him alone? A door being open&mdash;that of the <lb/>
pantry!&mdash;Her Royal Highness drew the poor husband in <lb/>
with her, and tried in a homely, kindly way to console him. <lb/>
Her remark to those near her was, 'Well, I am glad I <lb/>
asked about him; I think he will feel comforted.' Just <lb/>
little actions such as these endeared the Duchess to the <lb/>
general public; and this has a peculiar pathos when we <lb/>
know that she herself had to undergo the agony of two <lb/>
operations."</p>
<p>This touching letter is signed "One who was Present." <lb/>
The Duchess of Teck's fatal illness may be said to have <lb/>
<pb n="210" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0231"/>
commenced on April 29th, 1897; for, although she had <lb/>
been confined to the house with a cold for some days <lb/>
previously, serious symptoms only then appeared. Dr. <lb/>
Wadd, of Richmond, was called in, and he at once <reg orig="sum-|moned">summoned</reg> <lb/>
Mr. Allingham, who the following day successfully <lb/>
performed a difficult operation. The Duchess kept her <lb/>
room for several weeks, and became so far convalescent <lb/>
that she was able to take part in the Jubilee procession. <lb/>
It was not until July 2nd that she performed her first public <lb/>
act after her serious illness, in laying the foundation-stone <lb/>
of an isolation hospital for the joint districts of Richmond <lb/>
and Heston-Isleworth.</p>
<p>The last public ceremony in which the Duchess took <lb/>
part was laying the foundation-stone of a new church at <lb/>
Wandsworth. She had promised to open a sale of work <lb/>
at Richmond, in aid of the building fund of Christ Church; <lb/>
but before the day arrived, the announcement of her death <lb/>
was published.</p>
<p>On Monday, October 25th, the Duchess again showed <lb/>
symptoms of illness. The next day she grew rapidly worse, <lb/>
and Mr. Allingham was summoned, and another operation <lb/>
was deemed necessary, as it was the only chance of saving <lb/>
her life, though the weakness of heart from which the <lb/>
Duchess had long suffered rendered the result doubtful. <lb/>
The operation was performed at midnight, in the presence <lb/>
of Dr. Wadd, his son Dr. Randal Wadd, and Mr. Hewitt. <lb/>
The Duchess had borne her suffering heroically, and on <lb/>
her return to consciousness she showed the same calm <lb/>
fortitude. The nurse from the Great Central Hospital, <lb/>
who had attended her before, and had only left her a <lb/>
fortnight previously, had been summoned, and arrived while <lb/>
the Duchess was under chloroform. She recognised her <lb/>
at once, and smiled and put out her hand. "I am so <lb/>
pleased to see you," she murmured; but a few hours later <lb/>
failure of the heart's action set in.</p>
<pb n="211" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0232"/>
<p>At six o'clock the Lord Mayor received a telegram from <lb/>
the White Lodge: "My beloved wife died this morning. <lb/>
Please give public notice.&mdash;<hi rend="small-caps">Teck</hi>."</p>
<p>The sorrow was universal, and much sympathy was felt <lb/>
for the bereaved husband and children. The Royal Standard <lb/>
at the Mansion House was hoisted half-mast high, and the <lb/>
great bell of St. Paul's was tolled for an hour, in accordance <lb/>
with custom on the death of a member of the Royal House.</p>
<p>The funeral took place on Wednesday, November 3rd, <lb/>
1897, in St. George's Chapel, Windsor. The coffin, which <lb/>
was first taken into the choir of St. George's Chapel, and <lb/>
watched throughout the previous night by the Minor Canons <lb/>
of St. George's, at the conclusion of the funeral service was <lb/>
conveyed to its resting-place in the Royal vault under the <lb/>
Albert Chapel, which stands next to the Deanery in the <lb/>
lower ward.</p>
<p>Never was a great lady more sincerely lamented. Well has <lb/>
it been said of this beloved Princess: "Her charity is of that <lb/>
kind which, in other languages than ours, goes by the name <lb/>
of love, and which, in one of the grandest and most <lb/>
beautiful poems of the Book of books, is held even above <lb/>
faith and hope, those lights without which humanity would <lb/>
walk in darkness."</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">In</hi> this great world of living, teeming human beings, all <lb/>
hurrying to and fro on the mighty ant-hill of existence, <lb/>
each bent on his or her little fraction of business, there <lb/>
sometimes emerges from the shifting crowd some strong, <lb/>
distinct personality whose influence makes itself felt from <lb/>
the first, and who, by sheer force of will, seems to dominate <lb/>
and hold sway over its fellows. To feeble, mediocre <lb/>
characters there is nothing so alarming as undivided <reg orig="re-|sponsibility">responsibility</reg>; <lb/>
only those who are born in the purple know <lb/>
how to fill a throne. Human nature has its aristocracy and <lb/>
its democracy, its regality and kingship, and its proletariat, <lb/>
its hewers of wood and drawers of water, homely and <lb/>
plebeian. The leaders of men, the workers who have made <lb/>
their mark in their generation, and whose name is still <lb/>
handed down to us for reverence and admiration, at one <lb/>
time or other in their lives have stood alone; on their way <lb/>
to their promised land they have not feared to cross the <lb/>
wilderness, and to endure, if needs be, their forty years of <lb/>
wandering and unrest. "The end crowns all," that is their <lb/>
<pb n="216" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0239"/>
motto; and when they take possession of their inheritance <lb/>
they bear the travel-stains of the pilgrim and the scars of <lb/>
the warrior; greatness is theirs, but they have suffered its <lb/>
pains and penalties, and have not grudged to pay the price.</p>
<p>In considering the noted women of the Victorian era, <lb/>
there is no more fascinating personality than Dorothy <lb/>
Pattison, the beloved Sister Dora of Walsall, once described <lb/>
by one who knew her as "Our Pandora," unto whom the <lb/>
great God had given all precious gifts, besides an infinite <lb/>
hope, and "without the mischiefs."</p>
<p>There is profound truth in this eulogium, nevertheless. <lb/>
Dorothy Pattison's character was a strangely complex one&mdash; <lb/>
she was intensely human, and human nature is by no means <lb/>
perfect. In spite of her large heart, her deep womanly <lb/>
tenderness, her pure, sound nature, she yet made grievous <lb/>
mistakes in her life, which cost her anguish and bitter tears, <lb/>
and the very force of her strong will led her into error. She <lb/>
was very humble in her own estimate of herself. "I look <lb/>
back on my life and see 'nothing but leaves,'" she writes <lb/>
when lying on her death-bed, spent and worn with <reg orig="super-|human">superhuman</reg> <lb/>
labours for her suffering fellow-creatures&mdash;"nothing <lb/>
but leaves"; no one who knew Sister Dora would have <lb/>
endorsed that.</p>
<p>Dorothy Wyndham Pattison was born in the village of <lb/>
Hauxwell, near Richmond, in the North Riding of Yorkshire. <lb/>
Her father, the Rev. Mark James Pattison, was the rector of <lb/>
Hauxwell; he belonged to a Devonshire family. Dorothy <lb/>
was the youngest but one of twelve children; she inherited <lb/>
her beauty from her mother, and her finely proportioned <lb/>
figure from her father.</p>
<p>Miss Lonsdale, in her Life of Sister Dora, gives us a <lb/>
description of the place where she spent her childhood. <lb/>
"Hauxwell," she writes, "is a tiny village lying on the <lb/>
southern slope of a hill, from whence an extensive view of <lb/>
the moors and Wensleydale is obtained. It contains between <lb/>
<pb n="217" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0240"/>
two and three hundred inhabitants. The rectory is a pretty <lb/>
little dwelling, some half-mile from the church, which is a <lb/>
fine old building much shut in by trees. The whole village, <lb/>
even on a bright summer day, gives the traveller an impression <lb/>
of intense quiet, if not dulness; but in winter, when the <lb/>
snow lies thickly for weeks together in the narrow lane, the <lb/>
only thoroughfare of the place, when the distant moors look <lb/>
cold in their garment of white, and the large expanse of sky <lb/>
is covered with leaden-coloured clouds, when the very <lb/>
streams with which the country abounds are frozen into <lb/>
silence&mdash;then, indeed, may Hauxwell be called a lonely <lb/>
village."</p>
<p>Dorothy appears to have been a very delicate child, and <lb/>
much petted by her sisters. She was not allowed to learn <lb/>
much on account of her weak health; but her mind was <lb/>
vigorous, and she seemed to pick up crumbs of information <lb/>
almost instinctively. Even in early childhood she observed <lb/>
things minutely, and stored up in her memory the results of <lb/>
her observations. She very soon showed a great <reg orig="determina-|tion">determination</reg> <lb/>
to have her own way; but though wilful, she was not <lb/>
passionate, and her disposition was affectionate and unselfish.</p>
<p>"If she could not get her own way easily," we read, "she <lb/>
did not give it up or take refuge in sulks, or in an outbreak <lb/>
of temper, like most children; rather the meeting with <lb/>
opposition seemed to stimulate her active mind to find a <lb/>
device for getting her way back." There is an amusing <lb/>
anecdote told in illustration of this, of how Dorothy and her <lb/>
next sister tried to spoil some obnoxious velvet bonnets by <lb/>
putting their heads out of window one rainy day, and then <lb/>
laying them in their boxes soaking wet. "Quite spoilt: we <lb/>
can never wear them any more," was her answer when <lb/>
questioned about the bonnets; but, to their chagrin, the little <lb/>
culprits were condemned to wear them for many Sundays.</p>
<p>When Dorothy was fourteen she had a severe illness, <lb/>
accompanied by terrible spasms, and it was then she learnt <lb/>
<pb n="218" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0241"/>
to bear pain with such fortitude, "combined with an aptitude <lb/>
for always looking on the bright side of everything&mdash;a habit <lb/>
which never forsook her through life." After this her health <lb/>
began to improve.</p>
<p>The Pattison family were devoted to the village people. <lb/>
The girls would plan how to save their money, that they <lb/>
might give it away; they would mend their old dresses to <lb/>
avoid buying new ones, and give away their dinner and <lb/>
dine on bread and cheese. To give was a delight to them, <lb/>
and Dorothy shared their devotion to the poor. A boy <lb/>
who had fallen ill of rheumatic fever during her absence <lb/>
abroad, longed incessantly to see "Miss Dora" again before <lb/>
he died. On her return she went to him at once, and <lb/>
nursed him till he died. This seems to have been the only <lb/>
instance of her nursing sick people in early youth; her <lb/>
chief work at that time was training the village choir. She <lb/>
had a clear, powerful voice, with a love for music. As her <lb/>
health grew stronger she was also a daring horsewoman; she <lb/>
loved to follow the hounds, and go to meets with her <lb/>
brothers. She often described to her patients in after years <lb/>
her rides across the wild moorlands. She was also fond of <lb/>
driving herself in a pony carriage, and enjoyed running, <lb/>
jumping, and playing games.</p>
<p>By the time she was twenty Dora, as she was now called, <lb/>
had become tall and strong, full of restless, untiring energy <lb/>
that never allowed her to be inactive for a minute, and with <lb/>
a flow of bright, natural spirits. One neighbour writes, <lb/>
"Her merry laugh is still in my ears"; and another spoke <lb/>
of her "as a bright bonnie maiden singing about the house." <lb/>
Her personal beauty was remarkable; "her features were <lb/>
almost perfect; her white teeth and brilliant dark-brown <lb/>
eyes set widely apart and twinkling with merry sympathy," <lb/>
were some of her attractions, and also her small, beautifully <lb/>
shaped hands. "Perhaps later on in life," writes Miss <lb/>
Lonsdale, "the powerful form of her chin and jaw, <reg orig="remind-|ing">reminding</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="219" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0242"/>
one of Dante's profile, became too marked for beauty. <lb/>
At the age of twenty, however, the dark, lightly curling hair <lb/>
waving all over her head, which no amount of cutting off <lb/>
or covering with caps could ever smooth, the softness and <lb/>
roundness of youth, the extreme beauty of her whole <lb/>
colouring and complexion, made her a fascinating creature <lb/>
to look upon."</p>
<p>A country life did not satisfy Dora; her sympathies were <lb/>
roused by Miss Nightingale's work in Scutari, and she begged <lb/>
her father to allow her to join her band of nurses. This <lb/>
request was refused. He pointed out to her that she was <lb/>
wholly untrained and undisciplined, and that she had enough <lb/>
to employ her at home; and though she chafed secretly <lb/>
under the disappointment, she still did her home duties <lb/>
cheerfully. Her mother was an invalid, and she did much <lb/>
of the nursing, and her father called her "his sunshine." <lb/>
Sister Dora always believed in presentiments. During <lb/>
a visit to her brother she had a dream. She thought <lb/>
her mother stood beside her bed, and called, "Dora, Dora, <lb/>
Dora!" It left such a vivid impression on her mind that <lb/>
she told her old servant about it. The next night the dream <lb/>
returned, and Dora was convinced that her mother was in <lb/>
danger and wanted her. Her brother tried to laugh her out <lb/>
of the intention of sending to the neighbouring town for <lb/>
letters; but she persisted in doing so, and a letter which <lb/>
had been delayed three days was found, telling her of her <lb/>
mother's dangerous illness. She returned home at once, <lb/>
and found her on her deathbed. She died soon after. <lb/>
Dora was now deprived of her chief home occupation; <lb/>
her mother's death and other circumstances increased her <lb/>
longing for an active life.</p>
<p>During her visits to Redcar she became acquainted with <lb/>
some of the members of a large working Sisterhood calling <lb/>
themselves "the Good Samaritans," whose headquarters <lb/>
were at Coatham, where they had a convalescent home. <lb/>
<pb n="220" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0243"/>
As her quiet life grew more distasteful to her, she began to <lb/>
think these Sisters were to be envied. Her father <reg orig="dis-|approved">disapproved</reg> <lb/>
of her leaving home for other work, though he <lb/>
would not actually forbid it. Dora was nine-and-twenty, <lb/>
and certainly old enough to know her own mind. "I was <lb/>
very wilful; I did very wrong; let no one take me for an <lb/>
example," were her words on her deathbed, as though the <lb/>
memory of her waywardness had burdened her conscience <lb/>
through life. Her strong will prevailed, and in October <lb/>
1861 Dora left Hauxwell Rectory, and became nominally <lb/>
village schoolmistress in the parish of Woolston, near <lb/>
Bletchley, on the borders of Buckingham. Her father <reg orig="con-|tinued">continued</reg> <lb/>
her allowance. This and the small salary belonging <lb/>
to her office was all she had to live upon. She had a small <lb/>
cottage, kept no servant, only an old woman came in now <lb/>
and then do the scrubbing; but she seemed to have spent <lb/>
three years happily enough. Her beauty and highly-bred <lb/>
appearance soon excited interest in the neighbourhood, and <lb/>
her devotion to children made her popular. She visited <lb/>
them in their homes, and nursed them when they were ill. <lb/>
At times her loneliness must have tried her, and once she <lb/>
had an unpleasant experience with burglars who made off <lb/>
with her silver spoons and forks.</p>
<p>At the end of three years her health suffered. A neglected <lb/>
cold resulted in a severe attack of pleurisy, and when fit to <lb/>
be moved she was sent to Redcar for change. The old <lb/>
associations connected with the place revived, and in the <lb/>
autumn of 1864 she joined the Sisterhood of the "Good <lb/>
Samaritans" in spite of the disapproval of her family. It <lb/>
was impossible for those who knew her best to acquiesce <lb/>
in this step. They were too well aware that she was <lb/>
singularly unfitted for a Sister's life. The atmosphere was <lb/>
too restricted; and though she was soon very popular, <lb/>
there was no denying that she disliked the sole society of <lb/>
women, and somewhat despised their limited physical <lb/>
<pb n="221" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0244"/>
power. Her intellectual gifts and "pride of life," and her <lb/>
keen sense of humour, were likely to be snares to her.</p>
<p>But there were other reasons that were urging her to <lb/>
work&mdash;a profound restlessness and mental dissatisfaction. <lb/>
We read "that before she went to Woolston she fell under <lb/>
the influence of an intellect more powerful than her own, <lb/>
and the result of her contact with it was a shock to the very <lb/>
foundations of her religious faith.&hellip; Her mind was filled <lb/>
with doubts relating to the authenticity and inspiration of <lb/>
the Holy Scriptures, so that she could not give herself up to <lb/>
that personal devotion to Christ, without which her nature <lb/>
could not be satisfied."</p>
<p>The Sisterhood of the Good Samaritans was a secular <lb/>
community, and the members took no vows except that <lb/>
of obedience to the Mother Superior and the clergyman. <lb/>
Sister Dora's training was very distasteful to her; she <lb/>
made beds, scoured floors and grates, and finally became <lb/>
cook at Coatham. She actually sat down and cried one <lb/>
day when the beds she had made were pulled to pieces <lb/>
by some one in authority, and she had to remake them.</p>
<p>Her first attempts at nursing were made in the Cottage <lb/>
Hospital at North Annesley, near Middlesbrough, where <lb/>
she worked sometimes alone or with other Sisters.</p>
<p>In the early part of 1865 Sister Dora was sent to Walsall, <lb/>
to a small cottage hospital, which had been established <lb/>
the year before and was in charge of the Good Samaritan <lb/>
Sisterhood. Walsall was a town at that time containing <lb/>
about thirty-five thousand inhabitants, on the borders of the <lb/>
great coal and iron district in South Staffordshire called <lb/>
"The Black Country." There is a vivid description of <lb/>
Walsall in Sister Dora's "Life." One seems to see the <lb/>
forests of tall chimneys belching out smoke and flame, <lb/>
the "rows of dusky little red-brick houses, the huge cranes <lb/>
and dirty canals," which are so strangely transfigured and <lb/>
glorified at sunrise and sunset. At night, we read, "the <lb/>
<pb n="222" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0245"/>
spectator seems to be transported into the infernal regions, <lb/>
where the blinding glare of blast furnaces, the snorting <lb/>
of engines, the ponderous thud of steam hammers, and the <lb/>
clang and whiz and whirr of machinery, sounds that never <lb/>
cease and which are less noticed during the day, bewilder <lb/>
the senses."</p>
<p>The Birmingham hospitals were seven miles away, and <lb/>
as accidents were becoming frequent, it was necessary to <lb/>
have an accident hospital in Walsall. At first there were <lb/>
only four beds, but before the first twelve months had <lb/>
passed there were fourteen. The Sister in charge had <lb/>
fallen ill, and Sister Dora took her place. Unfortunately <lb/>
she soon after caught small-pox from one of the out-patients, <lb/>
and was very ill; in her delirium she occupied herself in <lb/>
tearing up her sheets into bandages. As soon as she <lb/>
recovered she resumed her nursing.</p>
<p>The Walsall people were rough and ignorant, and at first <lb/>
there was a good deal of prejudice against the Sisters, <lb/>
which gradually died out. Once, as Sister Dora was walking <lb/>
through the town late in the evening, a boy called out: <lb/>
"There goes one of those Sisters of Misery," and threw <lb/>
a stone which cut open her forehead. This young fellow <lb/>
was afterwards brought to the hospital much injured, and <lb/>
was tenderly nursed by Sister Dora. One night she <lb/>
found him crying, and when she asked him what was <lb/>
the matter, he said, with a sob, "Sister, I threw that <lb/>
stone at you." To his astonishment she told him that <lb/>
she had recognised him the moment he had been brought <lb/>
in. "It was his first practical experience of good returned <lb/>
for evil," observed Sister Dora, "and he did not know <lb/>
what to make of it."</p>
<p>She was recalled to Coatham in 1865. Sister Dora's <lb/>
irrepressible flow of spirits sometimes carried her away; <lb/>
once, for example, when she insisted on mounting a donkey <lb/>
renowned for his trick of kicking his rider off: the result <lb/>
<pb n="223" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0246"/>
was she fell on her knees, which were so bruised and <lb/>
swollen that she could not kneel without pain for weeks <lb/>
afterwards, but she dare not confess the cause of her <lb/>
suffering. Not long after this the celebrated physician, <lb/>
Sir James Simpson, came to the Home to find a Sister who <lb/>
would take charge of a lady who was nearly insane. His <lb/>
choice fell on Sister Dora. She was making a pudding <lb/>
with her sleeves tucked up when he saw her, and he said <lb/>
at once: "Send me that Sister; she is the one for my case."</p>
<p>The new patient lived near Coatham. Sister Dora had <lb/>
to sit up with her at night and return to the Home to sleep. <lb/>
From her own account it was not a pleasant berth: "An <lb/>
uncommonly unpleasant time I used to have of it," she <lb/>
would say; "what with the mad old lady who was fond <lb/>
of me, with the relations who were jealous of me, and with <lb/>
the flunkey who, because I had my breakfast in the <lb/>
housekeeper's room, took me for a servant, paying me <lb/>
attentions, and making love to me after the manner of his <lb/>
kind, by getting me good things to eat."</p>
<p>Sister Dora had one sensational experience, when her <lb/>
half-crazy patient, angry because her nurse would not accept <lb/>
some valuable jewellery, suddenly sprang out of bed and <lb/>
brandished a long knife over her head. As Sister Dora <lb/>
looked at her calmly she laid it aside, only saying, "I <lb/>
wanted to see if I could frighten you." After this Sister <lb/>
Dora always accepted the gifts, and then gave them up <lb/>
to the relatives the next day.</p>
<p>In November Sister Dora was again sent to Walsall, and <lb/>
though from time to time she went back to Coatham, her <lb/>
hospital work began steadily, and in spite of her want of <lb/>
training she impressed the medical men, with a sense of her <lb/>
fitness. Towards the middle of December she was ordered <lb/>
to nurse a private case in Devonshire; before final <reg orig="arrange-|ments">arrangements</reg> <lb/>
were made she received a letter from home telling <lb/>
her that her father was dangerously ill and wished to see <lb/>
<pb n="224" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0247"/>
her. She telegraphed to the Home for permission to go to <lb/>
Hauxwell, and received the unfeeling answer, "No, you <lb/>
must go to Devonshire at once."</p>
<p>The order seems almost incredible, yet Sister Dora with a <lb/>
mistaken sense of duty set off to Devonshire; but she had <lb/>
scarcely reached her destination before she received the <lb/>
tidings of her father's death. She was almost broken-hearted, <lb/>
and when the Mother Superior gave her permission to <lb/>
attend the funeral she refused to go. From this moment <lb/>
a breach commenced between her and Coatham, which <lb/>
widened as the years went on.</p>
<p>No wonder that in her sorrow Sister Dora plunged eagerly <lb/>
into work when she returned to Walsall. She was very <lb/>
ignorant, and her great ambition was to become a good <lb/>
surgical nurse. The in-patients were mostly men and boys <lb/>
disabled by coal-pit accidents or wounded by machinery, <lb/>
while a large number of out-patients&mdash;men, women and <lb/>
children&mdash;visited the hospital daily for medical advice or for <lb/>
the treatment of injuries. The old doctor who was attached <lb/>
to the hospital soon found out for himself that Sister Dora <lb/>
had more coolness, courage, and common sense than most <lb/>
women possessed, and he taught her a great deal. She was <lb/>
allowed to set simple fractures under his superintendence, <lb/>
and then, as he discovered the remarkable delicacy of her <lb/>
touch, he began to teach her the position of the arteries <lb/>
in the human body. No doubt her apprenticeship must <lb/>
have been tolerably severe, as hospital nursing entails <lb/>
constant strain and fatigue.</p>
<p>Just before she left Coatham she had received an offer of <lb/>
marriage; but though she was for some time undecided <lb/>
whether to accept it or not, her affections were not deeply <lb/>
engaged, and she finally resolved not to leave her work.</p>
<p>Her natural instincts inclined her strongly to the ordinary <lb/>
lot of women. Her love for children amounted to a passion, <lb/>
and she never ceased to regret that she would never have <lb/>
<pb n="225" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0248"/>
children of her own. Later in life she was heard to say, "If <lb/>
I had to begin life over again I would marry, because a <lb/>
woman ought to live with a man and be in subjection."</p>
<p>In early life she thought differently, and though her <lb/>
friends told her that she was throwing herself away, that <lb/>
her rare talents were wasted, and that she was admirably <lb/>
fitted for domestic life, her strong will was not to be <lb/>
coerced. Her reserve prevented her from disclosing her <lb/>
real reasons; but she herself felt "that her only hope of <lb/>
gaining light in her period of darkness lay in active work <lb/>
for the good of others"; so, to use the words of one who <lb/>
helped her in her difficulties, "she threw into her work <lb/>
at Walsall great powers of mind, strong enthusiasm and <lb/>
wonderful imagination."</p>
<p>Her main stumbling-block was the acuteness of her <reg orig="intel-|lect">intellect</reg>. <lb/>
When she was able to receive historical Christianity, <lb/>
her personal devotion to her Divine Master seemed almost <lb/>
to overwhelm her, and no self-sacrifice seemed too great. <lb/>
The wise counsels of a friend restrained her impetuosity, <lb/>
and prevented her from taking binding vows and entering <lb/>
a strict Sisterhood. He pointed out to her, that her special <lb/>
calling was active service, and that her work exactly suited <lb/>
her. Happily she took his advice, and commenced her <lb/>
work in a quiet, unobtrusive way, nursing not only in the <lb/>
hospital, but poor creatures in the slums and alleys who were <lb/>
too wretched to present themselves at the hospital.</p>
<p>In 1866 she had a serious illness brought on by exposure <lb/>
and neglect of ordinary precautions. She would come <lb/>
home soaked through, to find a crowd of out-patients <reg orig="await-|ing">awaiting</reg> <lb/>
her; wet clothes were constantly forgotten and allowed <lb/>
to dry on her. She did this once too often. After two or <lb/>
three weeks she was dangerously ill.</p>
<p>A clergyman who visited her constantly during her <reg orig="ill-|ness">illness</reg> <lb/>
was amazed at the fortitude with which she bore <lb/>
pain. She had asked him to wait a moment before he <lb/>
<pb n="226" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0249"/>
commenced to read. He related how "she turned away her <lb/>
face which was smiling, beautiful as he thought he had never <lb/>
seen a human face before; and his daughter, who was on <lb/>
the other side of the bed, was shocked to see it suddenly <lb/>
convulsed, as if with sharp agony, the tears streaming down <lb/>
the cheeks and the hands clutching convulsively at the <reg orig="bed-|clothes">bedclothes</reg>. <lb/>
In a moment she turned back calmly to him and <lb/>
said, 'Go on.'"</p>
<p>Sister Dora always expressed her strong belief that her <lb/>
recovery from this illness was due to the prayers of the <lb/>
congregation at St. James, Wednesbury. The incumbent of <lb/>
this church was the Rev. Richard Twigg, of whom it was <lb/>
said that he had "buried talents which would have won the <lb/>
admiration of the world in the smokiest dens of the Black <lb/>
Country." Sister Dora owed much to his teaching and <lb/>
influence, "and his was the main human support to which <lb/>
she consistently clung throughout her life."</p>
<p>In 1867 it was evident that the cottage hospital was <lb/>
inadequate to the needs of Walsall. Its situation did not <lb/>
admit of free ventilation. Fatal erysipelas broke out, and one <lb/>
man was under treatment for six months, but when an <reg orig="ampu-|tation">amputation</reg> <lb/>
case was sent out unhealed the authorities felt it had <lb/>
received its deathblow, and it was resolved to build a new <lb/>
hospital on a larger scale in a better situation. The town <lb/>
of Walsall stands on a steep hill. There was an open space <lb/>
covered with blackened grass sloping up to a second brow of <lb/>
the same hill called the Mount, where the church was; and <lb/>
here the new hospital was built. It contained twenty-eight <lb/>
beds, and three wards, and was so arranged that it was just <lb/>
possible for one person of Sister Dora's calibre to do the <lb/>
entire nursing.</p>
<p>The out-patient department was, however, too small for <lb/>
the numbers who crowded into it, and was unconnected with <lb/>
the main building. "This defect was remedied by Sister <lb/>
Dora herself, who devised a plan to connect it with the <lb/>
<pb n="227" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0250"/>
hospital by a glass passage, which she converted into a <lb/>
greenhouse."</p>
<p>A kitchen garden and a green lawn surrounded the <lb/>
building, and in spite of the exposed situation trees and <lb/>
shrubs flourished. From the windows there was a prospect <lb/>
of chimneys and machinery, and a wide extent of sky <lb/>
beyond. As the line of the South Staffordshire railroad <lb/>
ran at the bottom of the hill the patients had plenty of <lb/>
amusement.</p>
<p>About this time small-pox broke out in Walsall and <lb/>
lingered on for several months. Sister Dora did all she <lb/>
could for the sufferers. Whenever she could snatch an hour <lb/>
she visited the sick people in their own homes, and <reg orig="some-|times">sometimes</reg> <lb/>
sat up whole nights with dying patients who had been <lb/>
deserted by their friends. She had no terror of infection, <lb/>
and would dress the wounds of out-patients who had the <lb/>
small-pox out on them; and it has been thought by some <lb/>
that her recklessness about her own safety was in a great <lb/>
measure caused by her secret grief at her father's death, <lb/>
and her remorse at the course she had taken.</p>
<p>There is one story told in her memoir that reads like one <lb/>
belonging to a medi&aelig;val saint, and which would have been <lb/>
worthy of St. Francis of Assisi, or St. Vincent de Paul, and <lb/>
which proves, not only her deep pity and love for suffering <lb/>
humanity, but also her wonderful nerve and heroic <reg orig="endur-|ance">endurance</reg>. <lb/>
A poor man dying of "black-pox," who was much <lb/>
attached to her, sent for her one night. There was only a <lb/>
small piece of candle in the house, and she asked a neighbour <lb/>
who was with him to buy her some more, but the woman <lb/>
never returned. All at once the dying man raised himself <lb/>
and asked her to kiss him before he died; and, loathsome <lb/>
as he was with the horrible disease, she took the poor <lb/>
creature in her arms and kissed him, then, as the candle <lb/>
went out, she sat beside him in the darkness, not knowing if <lb/>
he were alive or dead, till the faint dawn allowed her to <lb/>
<pb n="228" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0251"/>
grope her way to the door. It was an ordeal that few <lb/>
women, however brave or good, could have endured.</p>
<p>An old servant of the Pattison family had come to help <lb/>
her at Walsall. She looked after the two servants, kept the <lb/>
hospital linen, and assisted her in many ways; she even <lb/>
learnt to dress wounds, and sometimes sat up with a patient.</p>
<p>Sister Dora's sympathy was often excited by the misery of <lb/>
the poor men who had to submit to amputation; many of <lb/>
them would have preferred death. One day a young man <lb/>
was brought to the hospital with his arm so torn and twisted <lb/>
by a machine that the doctor said he must amputate it at once. <lb/>
Sister Dora's heart was wrung at the poor fellow's despair. <lb/>
She looked at the torn limb, and then at the stalwart, healthy <lb/>
form of the young man, then she turned to the surgeon and <lb/>
told him quietly that she believed that she could save the <lb/>
arm if he would permit her to try. The doctor reiterated his <lb/>
former opinion, that unless the limb was at once amputated <lb/>
mortification would set in, but Sister Dora persisted that she <lb/>
could save him. The patient joyfully consented to submit to <lb/>
her treatment, but the doctor was deeply incensed. "Well, <lb/>
remember it's your arm," he said, as he walked off in high <lb/>
dudgeon. "If you choose to have that young man's death <lb/>
on your conscience I shall not interfere, but I wash my <lb/>
hands of him."</p>
<p>It was a terrible responsibility for Sister Dora, but her <lb/>
patient's confidence in her encouraged her. She watched <lb/>
"her arm," as she called it, night and day for three weeks. <lb/>
"How I prayed over that arm!" she said afterwards. At <lb/>
the end of the time she invited the doctor to see the result of <lb/>
her nursing. To his astonishment the arm, when unbandaged, <lb/>
was straightened, and in a healthy, promising condition. <lb/>
"Why, you have saved it," he exclaimed, and no wonder <lb/>
Sister Dora cried for happiness when she heard it. "Sister's <lb/>
arm," as the young man was called in the hospital, was <lb/>
devoted to her, and even when he was back at his work he <lb/>
<pb n="229" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0252"/>
would come up to have his arm looked at as an excuse for <lb/>
seeing the dear Sister again.</p>
<p>Sister Dora's influence over children was almost magical. <lb/>
Her passionate love for them taught her how to comfort <lb/>
them. She would carry about some miserable little scalded <lb/>
creature wrapped in a blanket, on one arm, instead of <lb/>
putting it to bed to cry itself to sleep. "Don't you cry&mdash; <lb/>
Sister's got you," she would say, and with her other hand she <lb/>
would dress wounds and do other things.</p>
<p>She had immense influence over the rough men and <lb/>
women who came to the hospital. She never allowed bad <lb/>
language in the wards; she made them feel the dignity of <lb/>
her presence, and she knew, too, how to make them feel <lb/>
ashamed of themselves.</p>
<p>Drunkenness was rife amongst the dwellers of the <lb/>
Black Country, and innumerable cases of hopeless bad <lb/>
legs, or old wounds breaking out afresh, were the result of <lb/>
intemperance. Sister Dora would remonstrate with her <lb/>
patients, and declared to them that unless they amended <lb/>
their ways she would not go on attending to them; but <lb/>
they knew better, and that her pity for them would never <lb/>
weary, and that she would never cease to dress their <lb/>
wounds, and try and win them to a better life. Once <lb/>
when a <hi rend="italic">proteg&eacute;</hi> of hers, a young fellow, had broken his <lb/>
promise to her, and came reeling into the ward, she laid <lb/>
down her head on the table and cried bitterly.</p>
<p>The men soon found she cared for them individually, and <lb/>
that she never forgot them. When they left the hospital <lb/>
her prayers followed them, and they knew they would <lb/>
always be sure of a welcome from "Sister."</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Sister Dora's</hi> sense of humour and delightful flow <lb/>
of spirits kept the wards cheerful. "Make you laugh!" <lb/>
remarked a big Irishman, "she'd make you laugh if you <lb/>
were dying." She would invent games for the boys, and <lb/>
when she had a few minutes to spare she would read to the <lb/>
men, and now and then play chess or draughts with them. <lb/>
She did not care to nurse the women, though she did her <lb/>
duty by them. She always went her rounds with the <lb/>
surgeon, and each night visited every patient. She carved <lb/>
at every meal herself, and if the out-patients were numerous <lb/>
the men would rather wait for their tea than have it served <lb/>
by any one else. She was so full of sympathy for them, <lb/>
so tender in her inquiries, so merry and full of fun, her <lb/>
father's name of Sunshine so exactly suited her, and then <lb/>
she was so natural and original.</p>
<p>"I have thoughts too big for my brains," she remarked <lb/>
once; and another time, "My dear, if I could not laugh <lb/>
<pb n="231" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0254"/>
over the things, I don't know what I should do;" for, in <lb/>
spite of her merry ways, her heart was very tender.</p>
<p>She never yielded her will in matters she considered <lb/>
important; she would employ drollery and humour and all <lb/>
manner of feminine devices to get her own way with the <lb/>
committee of management, and when every attempt failed <lb/>
would give in her resignation; this always brought them to <lb/>
reason.</p>
<p>Her position was a strangely solitary one. The clergy lived <lb/>
too far off for companionship, and her intercourse with the <lb/>
doctors was only in the way of business. She was in this <lb/>
isolated condition when a man crossed her path in whose <lb/>
society she took an ever-increasing pleasure. In intellect <lb/>
he was her superior; he could give her the sympathy and <lb/>
support for which she had longed all her life, and he loved <lb/>
her with intense devotion; but, alas! he had held sceptical <lb/>
views, and she knew this from the first.</p>
<p>It was a fearful temptation, and for a time she yielded to <lb/>
it. She became engaged to him. The same friend who had <lb/>
helped her before now pleaded with her to be true to her <lb/>
profession for the sake of others, if not for herself. In the <lb/>
end his arguments prevailed, and she was induced to <lb/>
break off her engagement; but the whole thing gave her <lb/>
acute suffering, and a severe illness ensued, an attack of <lb/>
py&aelig;mia came on, and matter formed in the knee. The old <lb/>
surgeon feared that amputation would be necessary to save <lb/>
life, but Sister Dora vowed she would rather die than <lb/>
submit to it, and ever after she showed a sad recklessness <lb/>
about her health. We read that "the poor old doctor <lb/>
went out of the hospital in tears, saying 'If Sister Dora dies <lb/>
I'll never enter these doors again.'" But she made up her <lb/>
mind that she was going to live; and after she had been a <lb/>
month ill, hearing that there was to be a serious operation <lb/>
she got out of bed and went straight to her work without <lb/>
passing through any stage of convalescence. While she was <lb/>
<pb n="232" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0255"/>
ill the young man whose arm she had saved walked eleven <lb/>
miles each Sunday to ask after her. When he received his <lb/>
answer, he said, "Tell her that's her arm that rang the <lb/>
bell," and walked back.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1869 Sister Dora did some private <lb/>
nursing; but during the three weeks she had to go back to <lb/>
Walsall twice to induce some patient to submit to a necessary <lb/>
operation.</p>
<p>Children who had been terribly burnt or scalded were <lb/>
often brought to the hospital; her treatment of the poor <lb/>
little creatures was both wise and tender. If the child <lb/>
were badly burnt, or beside itself with terror, she did not at <lb/>
once try to dress the wounds; she only excluded the air by <lb/>
means of cotton-wool, and wrapt it in a blanket, putting hot <lb/>
bottles and flannel to the feet. Then she fed it with milk <lb/>
and brandy and tried to soothe it. When the nerves were <lb/>
quieted she could then attend to the wounds without exciting <lb/>
fresh terror. If the child died, she was glad to know that <lb/>
it had not been uselessly tormented.</p>
<p>Her care for the little ones was truly maternal. She <lb/>
constantly took one, sometimes two, children into her own <lb/>
bed; and she has been known to sleep with a burnt baby on <lb/>
each arm, in spite of the sickening effluvia from the burns. <lb/>
One little girl of nine years was so badly burnt that she <lb/>
only lived a few hours. Sister Dora gave up her other <lb/>
work, and devoted herself to the dying child, talking to her <lb/>
about heaven and her Saviour. All pain had ceased, and <lb/>
the child died peacefully. Her last words were, "When <lb/>
you come to heaven, Sister, I'll meet you at the gates <lb/>
with a bunch of flowers." In the Memoirs of Sister Dora <lb/>
there is a long and interesting account, written by one of <lb/>
her lady pupils, which gives us an idea of her ordinary day's <lb/>
work at Walsall.</p>
<p>"Sister Dora," she narrates, "used to come down into <lb/>
the wards at half-past six in the morning, make the beds of <lb/>
<pb n="233" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0256"/>
all the patients who were able to get up, and give them <lb/>
their breakfast by half-past seven, when it was time for her <lb/>
own breakfast. The bright sunshiny way she always worked, <lb/>
with a smile and a pleasant word for every one, was in itself <lb/>
a medicine of the best kind.&hellip; No one had ever seen <lb/>
such a woman as this before; so beautiful, so good, so <reg orig="tender-|hearted">tenderhearted</reg>, <lb/>
so strong and so gentle, so full of fun and humour, <lb/>
and of sympathy for broken hearts as well as for every other <lb/>
kind of fracture, and the best friend that many of these poor <lb/>
maimed men had ever known.&hellip; After her own breakfast <lb/>
she read prayers on the staircase, so that all the patients in <lb/>
the three wards could hear and join. Then came the daily <lb/>
ward work, the washing up breakfast things and of patients, <lb/>
and the dressing of wounds. At half-past ten there were <lb/>
usually several out-patients who came regularly to have their <lb/>
wounds poulticed or lanced or otherwise attended to. The <lb/>
doctor generally appeared about eleven, and went his rounds. <lb/>
At twelve came the patients' dinner, at which Sister Dora <lb/>
attended minutely to every detail, and always carved herself. <lb/>
Then she read prayers in the little general sitting-room, the <lb/>
lady pupils, if there were any, and the servants only attending. <lb/>
Then followed dinner for the nurses&mdash;a very movable feast, <lb/>
sometimes put off for an hour or more, and sometimes <lb/>
omitted altogether, as far as Sister Dora was concerned, if <lb/>
any visitors whom she was obliged to see or any accidents <lb/>
came in at that time. Out-patients, who were treated every <lb/>
day, began to arrive at two, and truly their name was Legion. <lb/>
It was no uncommon event for sixty or a hundred persons <lb/>
to pass through the little rooms in the course of one <lb/>
afternoon. It was a most interesting sight to watch Sister <lb/>
Dora with her out-patients.&hellip; The doctors got through <lb/>
their part of the work quickly, for they passed on to her <lb/>
such minor operations and dressings as are entrusted to <lb/>
experienced dressers in large hospitals. The setting of <lb/>
fractures, and even the drawing of teeth, when no surgeon <lb/>
<pb n="234" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0257"/>
was present, were common operations to her.&hellip; The <lb/>
treatment of the out-patients often took between two and <lb/>
three hours, so that the in-patients' tea at five o'clock had <lb/>
sometimes to be prepared by servants, when neither Sister <lb/>
Dora nor her pupil could be spared. At half-past five or <lb/>
six the nurses had their tea.&hellip; After tea she went into <lb/>
the wards again, and this was the time to which her patients <lb/>
looked forward all day. She would go and talk to them then <lb/>
individually, or a probationer would play the harmonium <lb/>
and they would sing hymns, she joining with her strong <lb/>
cheery voice while she washed up the tea-things.&hellip; By <lb/>
eight, wounds had been dressed for the night, and the <lb/>
patients' supper was served. Sister Dora read prayers <lb/>
always, even when, as sometimes happened, her many <lb/>
duties and labours so delayed her that most of the patients <lb/>
were asleep; 'for,' she said, 'the prayers go up for them <lb/>
all the same.' Just before bedtime came her own supper, <lb/>
when she would often be very merry, and would relate her <lb/>
many remarkable experiences with intense fun and drollery."</p>
<p>Sister Dora always took the heaviest part of the work on <lb/>
herself, and she preferred doing as much as possible herself. <lb/>
She was the first up and the last to go to rest. Bishop <lb/>
Selwyn called her "the one-horse chay." She had strong, <lb/>
even violent prejudices, which she tried not to show to her <lb/>
lady pupils; but she was a patient teacher, and never grudged <lb/>
time or trouble. She said once to a lady who was engaging <lb/>
a servant for the hospital, "Tell her this is not an ordinary <lb/>
house or hospital. I want her to understand that all who <lb/>
serve here, in whatever capacity, ought to have one rule&mdash; <lb/>
love for God, and then I need not say love for their work. <lb/>
I wish we could use and really mean the word <hi rend="italic"><reg orig="Maison-|Dieu">Maison-Dieu</reg></hi>,"</p>
<p>She was a devout believer in prayer. "Pray without <lb/>
ceasing" seemed to be her motto. When the wards were <lb/>
quiet she might often be seen kneeling by the bed of some <lb/>
<pb n="235" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0258"/>
unconscious sufferer. She still continued to believe in <lb/>
presentiments. One night, after a serious amputation had <lb/>
been performed, she woke up suddenly with a strong <reg orig="con-|viction">conviction</reg> <lb/>
that something was wrong. It was impossible to <lb/>
sleep; so she got up and went to the patient, and found <lb/>
one of the larger arteries had broken away from its ligatures, <lb/>
and that he was slowly bleeding to death. She secured the <lb/>
artery in time to save his life.</p>
<p>She would never allow a corpse to remain a moment <lb/>
longer than necessary in the ward. One night a patient <lb/>
saw her take up the corpse of a man who had just died, <lb/>
and carry it straight to the mortuary. People have often <lb/>
received this story with incredulity, but it is an undoubted <lb/>
fact that Sister Dora's magnificent physique and wonderful <lb/>
strength enabled her to do more than other ordinary women. <lb/>
A friend whose sister once worked with Sister Dora told the <lb/>
writer of this sketch that Sister Dora gloried in her own <lb/>
strength. She would come into the ward with a dish <reg orig="con-|taining">containing</reg> <lb/>
a joint of beef weighing about eighteen or twenty <lb/>
pounds in one hand, and a dish of vegetables in the other, <lb/>
and say, "None of you could do this!" She was indeed an <lb/>
athlete among women. She would pick up a huge collier <lb/>
who had fallen out of bed, and put him back like a baby; <lb/>
and yet with all these strains, little food and insufficient <lb/>
rest, her health did not seem to suffer.</p>
<p>Every one knows the story of the chopped-off finger, and <lb/>
how she sent the boy back to fetch it; and how she set the <lb/>
fracture, and the finger healed.</p>
<p>In 1871 her grateful patients subscribed &pound;50, with which <lb/>
they bought a small carriage and pony, and presented them <lb/>
to her. At first Sister Dora was rather embarrassed by the <lb/>
gift, but she soon found it useful for convalescent patients <lb/>
and for visiting sick people in the town. In the March of <lb/>
1873 a mission was held at Walsall, and Sister Dora, with <lb/>
her customary energy, took an active part. In September <lb/>
<pb n="236" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0259"/>
she had a few days' holiday, and went to see the autumn <lb/>
man&oelig;uvres. In October she had a short but sharp attack <lb/>
of fever, caught in nursing a bad case; but she soon <reg orig="re-|covered">recovered</reg>, <lb/>
and wrote to a friend that "the hospital was full <lb/>
of interesting cases&mdash;one man with a compound fracture of <lb/>
each leg, and no less than thirty cuts on his head."</p>
<p>During one of her visits to Redcar she was bathing one <lb/>
day, when a woman got out of her depth. Sister Dora <lb/>
swam out to her, and tried to assist her; but the poor <lb/>
woman had lost all self-control, and clung to her so <lb/>
frantically that they were both in danger of being drowned. <lb/>
Sister Dora held her up until her cries for help attracted <lb/>
the attention of a gentleman, and he came to their rescue.</p>
<p>In August 1874 she had a well-earned holiday, and <lb/>
joined a sister and her children at Redcar. In the autumn <lb/>
of 1874 she took a number of convalescent patients to <lb/>
Rhyl. Their ages ranged from two years old to sixty. <lb/>
Only one of the patients had ever seen the sea before. It <lb/>
was an immense success. The necessary funds had been <lb/>
provided by a former lady pupil.</p>
<p>On another occasion she took seven or eight boys, all of <lb/>
whom had suffered surgical operations, to Sutton Park, near <lb/>
Walsall; and sometimes she took a number of patients, <lb/>
night-nurses, and humble friends to Lichfield for the day. <lb/>
She paid most of the expenses of the expeditions herself. <lb/>
Her charity was great. No one knew what her income <lb/>
really was; but Mr. Pattison's property was considerable, <lb/>
and it was divided among his children. Her benevolence <lb/>
was unceasing. Servants worn with illness, governesses, <lb/>
and workers were often helped. She was very anxious to <lb/>
establish a convalescent home by the seaside, but during <lb/>
her life this project was never carried out. She used to <lb/>
send her patients to the home at Coatham, until, at the end <lb/>
of 1874, she broke off all connection with the community of <lb/>
the "Good Samaritans." When questioned as to her reasons <lb/>
<pb n="237" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0260"/>
for leaving the Sisterhood, her reply was, "I am a woman, <lb/>
and not a piece of furniture."</p>
<p>When the committee received an official communication <lb/>
informing them that the Sisterhood would no longer be <lb/>
responsible for the nursing at Walsall, they at once requested <lb/>
Sister Dora to take the entire management. In November <lb/>
1874 she heard of the death of a dear sister, and for some <lb/>
time she was doubtful whether her duty did not lie with her <lb/>
bereaved brother-in-law and his motherless children; but <lb/>
after some weeks of indecision she made up her mind to <lb/>
seek advice, and she was counselled to remain at Walsall. <lb/>
During the struggle she had written: "I am afraid it is all <lb/>
selfishness on my part which makes me hesitate. No one <lb/>
knows what it will cost me to give up the work here, home, <lb/>
friends, and go to that barren moor." This decision was <lb/>
a great relief to her, and from this time she worked harder <lb/>
than ever. She literally spent herself for the sick, the <lb/>
sinful, and the sorrowful, who sent for her from all sides. <lb/>
"Send for Sister Dora" was their cry; and she never <lb/>
failed them.</p>
<p>In the early part of February 1875 there was another <lb/>
outbreak of small-pox in Walsall, which spread with frightful <lb/>
rapidity. The Mayor and Corporation had erected an <lb/>
epidemic hospital on the outskirts of the town; but the poor <lb/>
people refused to go&mdash;"they would rather die at home." <lb/>
In this dilemma Sister Dora came to the rescue. She <lb/>
offered to leave her work and nurse the small-pox patients <lb/>
and this offer was joyfully accepted by the authorities <lb/>
They knew well that if Sister Dora were in charge of the <lb/>
epidemic hospital they would be willing to send their <lb/>
relatives to be nursed there. Her generous devotion would <lb/>
save Walsall. The cottage hospital was left under the <lb/>
care of three lady pupils. She gave them no special orders; <lb/>
told them they must divide the work and do their best until <lb/>
she returned. They would have the doctor's supervision, <lb/>
<pb n="238" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0261"/>
but no one could fill her place to the unhappy small-pox <lb/>
sufferers.</p>
<p>One must touch here on a weak point in Sister Dora's <lb/>
character&mdash;a serious defect in a singularly beautiful nature: <lb/>
she was unwilling that any one should even temporarily fill <lb/>
her place. This jealousy was strangely unworthy of her; and <lb/>
there is no doubt that her work and the hospital suffered <lb/>
from her tendency to dislike any woman worker who showed <lb/>
marked ability, and who was capable of taking her place. <lb/>
This was a sad blemish, and it led to unhappy results, for it <lb/>
made her gather round her second- or third-rate workers who <lb/>
were incapable of being her rivals. It was a flaw in an <lb/>
otherwise almost perfect character; but possibly she was <lb/>
hardly aware of this defect herself. She went to the <lb/>
epidemic hospital with the conviction that she would <lb/>
probably take the complaint and die; but for once her <lb/>
presentiment was wrong.</p>
<p>The epidemic hospital stands in the midst of heaps of <lb/>
"slag," the refuse of the iron furnaces. "It seems the <lb/>
end of the earth," Miss Lonsdale tells us, "and you look <lb/>
back upon smoky Walsall, with its crowning steeple and <lb/>
teeming inhabitants, as from a desert land.&hellip; The hospital <lb/>
is a long, low building of one storey, forming two sides of a <lb/>
square, with its entrance in the angle. In front about a <lb/>
quarter of an acre of ground is planted with cabbages for <lb/>
the use of the patients, and these dismal-looking rows of <lb/>
blackened vegetables seem to add to the desolation of the <lb/>
scene. Not a tree or a bush stands up against the sky, and <lb/>
and the ancient heaps of powdered slag hide from view even <lb/>
the neighbouring collieries, and the undulating lines of the <lb/>
distant hills of Cannock Chase.</p>
<p>As Sister Dora stood on the doorstep her heart failed her, <lb/>
and she exclaimed: "Oh, take me back! I cannot endure <lb/>
this dreadful place! I had no idea what it would be like <lb/>
when I said I would come here."</p>
<pb n="239" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0262"/>
<p>Her friend, the surgeon, who escorted her, and who was <lb/>
responsible for the epidemic hospital, knew her well; he <lb/>
only said "Come in;" for he was quite sure that she would <lb/>
be delighted with the internal arrangements.</p>
<p>The two wards were large and lofty, and capable of <lb/>
division by sliding doors; the windows barred with iron&mdash;a <lb/>
necessary precaution; and excellent ventilation contrived <lb/>
from the roof. Two large day rooms, a good kitchen, a <lb/>
sitting and bedroom in one for the nurse, a tiny one for the <lb/>
porter, and a small dispensary, comprise the whole. Entirely <lb/>
separate are a good laundry, a mortuary, disinfecting oven, <lb/>
and a stable containing an ambulance.</p>
<p>Sister Dora's practical mind was charmed with these <lb/>
arrangements, and she soon told the doctor that she had <lb/>
never seen a place where work would be so delightful, and <lb/>
that the building would spoil her for the Cottage Hospital.</p>
<p>Her work began at once. The twenty-eight beds were <lb/>
soon filled. The only help she had was from the old <lb/>
porter; he was very attentive, but would occasionally go <lb/>
off "on the drink, and leave her alone the whole night <lb/>
with the dead and dying. Two old women from the <lb/>
workhouse shared with her the loathsome washing of <lb/>
clothes and bedding."</p>
<p>It must have been horrible work. Sister Dora, in one of <lb/>
her letters, speaks of the revoltingly dirty condition of some <lb/>
of the patients. "I can only venture to wash their hands <lb/>
and faces in hot water this morning," she writes. She was <lb/>
not without visitors. Her faithful friend, the doctor, brought <lb/>
her books, and flowers, and news from the Cottage Hospital. <lb/>
Old patients called. One of them, an engine-stoker, Chell, <lb/>
came continually to see her. "I could not tell you all <lb/>
her goodness to me, words would fail me if I did," was his <lb/>
remark once. His leg had been crushed in a railway <lb/>
accident, and amputation was necessary. His own words <lb/>
were: "When I come to after the chloroform she was on <lb/>
<pb n="240" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0263"/>
her knees by my side, with her arm supporting my head, <lb/>
and she was repeating&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>'They climbed the steep ascent of heaven</l>
<l rend="indent">Through peril, toil, and pain;</l>
<l>O God, to us may grace be given</l>
<l rend="indent">To follow in their train.'</l>
</lg></q>
And all through the pain and trouble that I had afterwards <lb/>
I never forgot Sister's voice saying those words." He was in <lb/>
the hospital for fifteen weeks, and had to endure another <lb/>
operation before he left. Sister Dora wrote three resolutions <lb/>
in a pocket-book she gave him:&mdash;&lpar;1&rpar; Come and see Sister <lb/>
Dora once a week; &lpar;2&rpar; Will go to church more regularly; <lb/>
&lpar;3&rpar; Seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness.</p>
<p>Sister Dora never liked Sunday visitors, because she wished <lb/>
to go to church herself, and was afraid the patients' friends <lb/>
would bring in forbidden food to their friends in her absence; <lb/>
but old patients were allowed to come. No fear of infection <lb/>
could keep Chell from his friend, and others went too.</p>
<p>Poor Sister Dora had her difficulties in the epidemic <lb/>
hospital. "I cannot get a decent woman to come and <lb/>
help," she wrote, "although we pay well. I have got two <lb/>
'critters' from the workhouse; one is so helpless, I have <lb/>
to do the work for her, and the other sits up all night, so <lb/>
can do no more. One man is so delirious, I cannot keep my <lb/>
eye off him, or else he is out of bed. Then I have a baby <lb/>
a year old, and another younger; and they are so cross, <lb/>
they keep up their music day and night." And in another <lb/>
letter later she says: "One man is blind with the pox <lb/>
Another, a woman, is very delirious; she tried to escape <lb/>
last night&mdash;it took myself and the porter to hold her down. <lb/>
That fellow is very good; he scrubbed the kitchen floor <lb/>
early this morning to save me.&hellip; I am writing while <lb/>
waiting for my potatoes to boil. My bedroom and <reg orig="sitting-|room">sitting-room</reg> <lb/>
is getting to look quite gay with flowers.&hellip; I really <lb/>
<pb n="241" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0264"/>
wish you could take a peep at me. I am very bright and <lb/>
happy, and like this hospital better than the other. I have <lb/>
all so much under my eye." By-and-by she begged her <lb/>
friend to send her all the old novels they could find, as she <lb/>
was so weary at night that only a real sensational novel <lb/>
would keep her awake.</p>
<p>She had plenty of sensational incidents in her daily work. <lb/>
One night, when the porter was off on the drink, she was <lb/>
left absolutely alone. One of the patients, a Roman Catholic, <lb/>
was dying, and begged to see a priest. She had no one to <lb/>
send, and actually went to the priest's house in the middle <lb/>
of the night, running all the way. The priest was so shocked <lb/>
at her lonely condition that he went to the Town Council <lb/>
the next morning to tell them that help must be procured <lb/>
for the Sister, but they could find no one to go.</p>
<p>Another night, when the porter was away and she was <lb/>
reading to keep herself awake, a delirious patient, a tall, <lb/>
heavy man, sprang out of bed with a loud yell and rushed <lb/>
to the door. Sister Dora did not hesitate she grappled with <lb/>
him at once, although he was covered with the horrible <lb/>
disease, confluent small-pox. She got him back to bed and <lb/>
held him until the doctor arrived. His amazement when he <lb/>
heard of the struggle was great. "Sister Dora could sit up <lb/>
at night and work all day," he observed, "with little or no <lb/>
rest, and as far as I can judge she was neither physically nor <lb/>
mentally the worse for it. Her strength was superhuman&mdash; <lb/>
I never saw such a woman." One fact seems almost <lb/>
incredible; it brings a shudder even to read it. "Sister Dora <lb/>
was in the habit of bringing to life patients who had sunk <lb/>
into the first stage of the fatal collapse which often precedes <lb/>
death, by actually putting her mouth to theirs and breathing <lb/>
into them until vitality was restored." It was not until the <lb/>
middle of August 1875 that the last small-pox patient left her, <lb/>
and she returned to Walsall Hospital after six months' <lb/>
absence. Latterly, as her work had lightened, she had <lb/>
<pb n="242" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0265"/>
visited it for a few hours at a time, after taking proper <reg orig="pre-|cautions">precautions</reg>, <lb/>
as things were in an unsatisfactory state there, and <lb/>
the surgeon had to perform serious operations without her <lb/>
assistance.</p>
<p>She always spoke lovingly of "her dear epidemic hospital;" <lb/>
but though she did not know it, a terrible piece of work was <lb/>
coming to her. In October an explosion of the furnace of <lb/>
the ironworks at Burchill, near Walsall, took place. One <lb/>
man at the top was feeding the fires and eleven others were <lb/>
resting below. The unfortunate men below were covered <lb/>
with molten metal, and in their agony jumped into the canal. <lb/>
They were rescued with difficulty, and, with the exception of <lb/>
one man who wished to be taken home, they were driven to <lb/>
the hospital.</p>
<p>The poor charred bodies hardly seemed to belong to <lb/>
human beings. Some were in terrible agony, others dying <lb/>
painlessly; some cried out to her to dress them at once. "But <lb/>
even among those stricken, tortured creatures there was one <lb/>
heroic soul. The narrative is very touching." One poor man <lb/>
named Phillips&mdash;let due honour be done to his memory&mdash; <lb/>
seeing how Sister Dora was distracted by the cries for help <lb/>
by which she was surrounded, said, "Sister Dora, I want <lb/>
to be dressed very bad, but if there's any wants you worse <lb/>
go and do them first." He was in intense agony and could <lb/>
only lie on his face; he died in the night. Some lingered <lb/>
for ten days, others longer. The sight and smell were <lb/>
horrible&mdash;even the medical men were ill and could hardly <lb/>
stay in the ward; but Sister Dora not only never went to bed <lb/>
those ten days, but stayed in the foul atmosphere and hardly <lb/>
left it day or night. It was the only time she had to fortify <lb/>
herself for her work with brandy. Some people tried to <lb/>
help, but in a few minutes they were sitting on the stairs <lb/>
faint and sick with horror. Two of the men ultimately <lb/>
recovered&mdash;one of them the man who was feeding the flames. <lb/>
He was six months in the hospital; his name was Cassidy, he <lb/>
<pb n="243" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0266"/>
was an Irishman, and he would show his burnt and shrivelled <lb/>
hands and arms as he told his story.</p>
<p>He would describe "Sister Dora going from bed to bed, <lb/>
talking, laughing, and even joking with the poor men, sitting <lb/>
by their bedsides telling stories which she hoped might <lb/>
divert them for a moment from their misery, feeding them <lb/>
with the tenderest care, helping them to bear their pain, and <lb/>
pointing out the way to heaven to those who were appointed <lb/>
to die.&hellip;" Every time he said "Sister Dora" he stood up <lb/>
and reverently pulled his forelock, as though he had <reg orig="pro-|nounced">pronounced</reg> <lb/>
the name of a saint or an angel which he was <lb/>
scarce worthy to utter. "What we felt for her I couldn't <lb/>
tell you&mdash;my tongue won't say it," he exclaimed.</p>
<p>At the end of the year 1875 the authorities of the Cottage <lb/>
Hospital were in difficulties. The ward where the poor <lb/>
sufferers from the Burchell's explosion had been was <reg orig="hope-|lessly">hopelessly</reg> <lb/>
infected, the whole place impregnated with poison. <lb/>
Erysipelas broke out, wounds would not heal, and it was <lb/>
determined the old hospital should be pulled down and a <lb/>
new and larger one built.</p>
<p>A temporary house in Bridgeman Street was found, but it <lb/>
would only hold ten beds. Sister Dora had to give up <lb/>
taking lady pupils. The situation was a noisy one; it was so <lb/>
close to the railroad that the trains shook the house, and <lb/>
she was obliged to ask the engine-driver not to let out steam <lb/>
close to the hospital as it awakened her patients, "or startled <lb/>
a burnt baby into screams for the rest of the night."</p>
<p>In November 1876, when Sister Dora and her patients <lb/>
were settled in the little home in Bridgeman Street, another <lb/>
mission was held, and she threw herself into the work. <lb/>
She suggested to the missioners that some attempt should <lb/>
be made to rescue the fallen women of the town, and they <lb/>
agreed on condition that she should herself conduct this <lb/>
part of the mission.</p>
<p>On the first night, when the services were over, she guided <lb/>
<pb n="244" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0267"/>
them into one of the worst slums of Walsall. As they turned <lb/>
into the narrow court, she said to the missioners, "Now <lb/>
keep close behind me. I am safe enough, but your lives <lb/>
are not worth a moment's purchase if you are seen here <lb/>
without me to protect you." Their reception was a rough <lb/>
one. A volley of oaths met them; but Sister Dora was not <lb/>
daunted. She spoke kindly to the women, addressing them <lb/>
by name, then she said, "Now I want you all to go down <lb/>
on your knees with me now, this moment, and say a prayer <lb/>
to God"; and to the astonishment of the clergymen the <lb/>
whole party knelt round her, and after that they followed <lb/>
her into the mission-room, where a short service followed.</p>
<p>For some time after the mission she continued to hold <lb/>
midnight services for these poor women. She also interested <lb/>
herself in the cabdrivers of Walsall, and had meetings or <lb/>
classes for them during the mission.</p>
<p>She had little rest during the mission week. As soon as she <lb/>
had dressed her patients' wounds and put them to bed, she <lb/>
went to her cabmen's gathering. When that was over she <lb/>
must have gone on to her midnight meeting, and yet by <lb/>
6.30 she was up and in the wards. During the winter of <lb/>
1876, Sister Dora, for the first time, found a difficulty in <lb/>
lifting her patients. She had contrived a method of carrying <lb/>
the dead down stairs. She would pass a broad bandage <lb/>
round the corpse, and then tying the ends round her own <lb/>
neck she would take the dead body in her strong arms and <lb/>
carry it down to the mortuary. As the difficulty increased, <lb/>
she consulted a medical man. He examined her carefully, <lb/>
and discovered the existence of a disease that must ultimately <lb/>
prove fatal. He told her that surgical aid might prolong her <lb/>
life, but after consideration she decided to let the disease <lb/>
take its course.</p>
<p>She bound the doctor to secrecy, as she resolved that <lb/>
no one should know her condition, and it was her wish to <lb/>
continue her work as long as possible, and if people knew <lb/>
<pb n="245" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0268"/>
she was ill or suffering they might harass her with kindly <lb/>
meant remonstrances. She promised to consult him <reg orig="when-|ever">whenever</reg> <lb/>
it was necessary, but wished to have no regular medical <lb/>
attendance. It must have been a terrible moment for the <lb/>
heroic worker to hear her death-warrant pronounced. She <lb/>
was apparently in the fulness of health and strength, <reg orig="brim-|ming">brimming</reg> <lb/>
over with life and spirits; no wonder she needed all <lb/>
her self-control and fortitude. She was doomed, and she <lb/>
knew it; and her resolve was taken at once,&mdash;to devote <lb/>
the whole energy of her body and soul to make the utmost <lb/>
of the time left to her.</p>
<p>She worked harder than ever. "I grudge every moment <lb/>
I must spend in taking care of the body," she wrote to a <lb/>
friend who knew nothing of her condition. "I fairly grudge <lb/>
myself the time which must be spent in sleep."</p>
<p>Her little pony-carriage was used nearly every day. <lb/>
From six till ten or eleven at night she drove to see <lb/>
patients who could not be received into the hospital, and <lb/>
her chief happiness was to pass the night beside some <lb/>
dying patient, soothing and comforting the sufferer. The <lb/>
midnight classes for women were still carried on during the <lb/>
winter of 1876.</p>
<p>Her expeditions at night in the cold and wet brought on <lb/>
a return of acute inflammation, and for a short time she was <lb/>
dangerously ill; but kind "Sister Death" refused to take <lb/>
her in her merciful arms, and in spite of her prayers Sister <lb/>
Dora recovered. Who could wonder that she longed to die, <lb/>
and that even her indomitable spirit quailed at the thought <lb/>
of those months of suffering that were before her? But with <lb/>
recovery her courage and cheerfulness returned. The new <lb/>
hospital was being built, and Sister Dora took a great interest <lb/>
in the plans.</p>
<p>She still continued her nocturnal visits, and had some <lb/>
unpleasant experiences. Once, as she was driving to Sutton <lb/>
two ruffians sprang out of the hedge and seized the pony's <lb/>
<pb n="246" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0269"/>
head, only a man on horseback came round the corner and <lb/>
they ran away.</p>
<p>Another dark night a man with a thick stick rushed after <lb/>
them. The porter, who always drove Sister Dora, whipped <lb/>
up the pony. "I had only time," she said, "for a short <lb/>
prayer, when the stick was brought down heavily on the <lb/>
back of the carriage. I had leant instinctively to one side <lb/>
as I had said my prayer, and so my head escaped the blow <lb/>
that was intended for it." The porter always declared that <lb/>
the ruffians did not know whom they were attacking. He <lb/>
looked upon those drives as some of the jolliest hours of <lb/>
his life. "She never stopped talking," he would say, "and <lb/>
telling me stories."</p>
<p>Her friend, Mr. Twigg, had been dangerously, ill and had <lb/>
gone to Sutton for change of air, and she often visited him <lb/>
there.</p>
<p>Towards the early spring the symptoms of her disease <lb/>
increased so rapidly that, at the urgent request of her doctor <lb/>
she consulted Mr. Crompton of Birmingham, from whose <lb/>
opinion there could be no appeal. He endorsed the opinion <lb/>
of her medical adviser. Though there were no signs of illness <lb/>
about her, the cancer was increasing and surgical dressing <lb/>
became necessary. She attended to the wound herself, and <lb/>
although she had three cases of the same kind under her <lb/>
care whose wounds she regularly dressed, she adhered to <lb/>
her resolution not to seek help.</p>
<p>One night the doctor summoned her to look at a child <lb/>
who was in the last stages of diphtheria. As a last hope he <lb/>
performed the operation of tracheotomy. Sister Dora knelt <lb/>
down by the bed, and putting her mouth to the incision <lb/>
cleared the child's throat of the poisonous mucus. The <lb/>
child recovered, to die of another disease, and Sister Dora <lb/>
had diphtheritic sore throat for three weeks. In June 1878 <lb/>
she left for a fortnight's holiday; on her return typhoid fever <lb/>
broke out in the temporary hospital in Bridgeman Street, <lb/>
<pb n="247" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0270"/>
and it was necessary to close it. She very soon found <lb/>
herself at liberty, and in August she left Walsall, feeling <lb/>
sure that she would never work there again. She joined <lb/>
some of her nieces who were spending the summer in <lb/>
the Isle of Man. She was in high spirits, and the only <lb/>
difference her relatives noticed was she did not walk so far <lb/>
or so fast as she used to do. She taught her nieces to <lb/>
swim, and seemed full of life and health. In the autumn <lb/>
she went to Paris to see the Exhibition, and to study the <lb/>
wonderful inventions in the way of surgical appliances. At <lb/>
the end of September she was in London, where she <lb/>
intended to study Professor Lister's treatment of wounds, <lb/>
with a view of using his method in the hospital. She <lb/>
stayed at a nursing home in Fitzroy Square, where she was <lb/>
permitted to witness his operations. Her own disease was <lb/>
making rapid strides, and her cough increased so terribly <lb/>
that one of the London doctors proposed to examine her <lb/>
chest. In terror that her secret would be discovered by <lb/>
a stranger, she hurried off to Birmingham to consult Mr. <lb/>
Crompton.</p>
<p>Fatigue and anxiety of mind brought on fatal symptoms, <lb/>
and it was thought she would never leave Birmingham <lb/>
alive. Mr. Crompton wished to take her into his own <lb/>
house, but she begged to be moved to Walsall. "Let me <lb/>
die among my own people," was her cry.</p>
<p>The surgeon of the Walsall Hospital removed her in his <lb/>
own carriage, and she was taken to a small house that <lb/>
the committee had hired for her.</p>
<p>She wrote to a dear friend, a clergyman: "I wonder <lb/>
what you will say when you hear the decree has gone out&mdash; <lb/>
'Sister, put thy house in order, for thou shalt die and not <lb/>
live.' Such is the verdict of the doctors; such my own <lb/>
feelings this time&hellip; I have not had two hours' sleep for <lb/>
four days and nights, but in the midst of the fiery furnace <lb/>
there was a form like unto the Son of God.&hellip;"</p>
<pb n="248" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0271"/>
<p>Sister Dora still enjoined secrecy on her doctors, and <lb/>
it was commonly believed that she was dying of <reg orig="con-|sumption">consumption</reg>. <lb/>
"Her'll get well," the people said, "her <lb/>
never can be going to die"; but this conviction was <lb/>
followed by despair, when, in answer to their anxious <lb/>
inquiries, they received the answer, "No hope&mdash;only a <lb/>
question of time."</p>
<p>Sister Dora had hoped that she might recover sufficiently <lb/>
to be able to be carried to the door of the new hospital, <lb/>
which was nearly completed, to declare it open with her <lb/>
own lips; but this last hope vanished. After her return to <lb/>
Walsall she never left her bed. Her sufferings increased. <lb/>
She soon was unable to take solid food, and incessant <lb/>
sickness set in. She could only obtain sleep by the use of <lb/>
opiates, until at last they ceased to have effect. Her <lb/>
old servant, Mrs. H., with the help of two other <reg orig="night-|nurses">night-nurses</reg>, <lb/>
nursed her through the night, and she was obliged <lb/>
at last to let Mrs. H. dress her wound when the doctor was <lb/>
not available to help her do it herself. She would not send <lb/>
for any of her own family. When two of her sisters went <lb/>
to Walsall for a week, in her morbid desire for concealment <lb/>
she would not allow them to nurse her, and they were <lb/>
obliged to leave her. Even on her deathbed her proud <lb/>
reticence and strong will prevailed. She told her doctors <lb/>
she would not give people the opportunity of "saying that <lb/>
she killed herself by her mode of life," and as long as <lb/>
possible she hid her physical suffering.</p>
<p>The approach of death&mdash;merciful death&mdash;was only a joy <lb/>
to her. She had struggled so hard for twenty months, and <lb/>
she was so worn out and weary. But this joy and relief was <lb/>
followed by deep depression, and "a horrible dread" of <lb/>
dying oppressed her. "I cannot pray, I cannot think; I <lb/>
sadly fear I shall be lost," were her words: "I can only <lb/>
trust." But even in this darkness her faith enabled her to <lb/>
cling to the cross, though her bright, hopeful spirit seemed <lb/>
<pb n="249" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0272"/>
quenched in those deep waters. "I am in God's hands <lb/>
now," was her cry.</p>
<p>Her one earthly anxiety was to find some one competent <lb/>
to take charge of the new hospital. To her relief a <lb/>
friend and former lady pupil promised to undertake the <lb/>
nursing until a permanent head could be found, and on <lb/>
November 4th the hospital was opened in Sister Dora's <lb/>
name. She took great delight in the silver key in a velvet <lb/>
case which was sent to her by the committee.</p>
<p>Whenever she rallied, she showed her old interest in her <lb/>
friends' welfare. Her old patients who came to see her were <lb/>
received with beaming smiles, though perhaps a few minute <lb/>
before she had been groaning with pain. Some of them said <lb/>
"she was that cheerful and jolly that they were sure she <lb/>
would come round."</p>
<p>When her sufferings increased, and she could not pray for <lb/>
herself, she would beg her nurse to pray aloud. "I am not <lb/>
half so good and patient as many of those I have nursed," <lb/>
she would say.</p>
<p>Towards the end of November she grew suddenly worse, <lb/>
and then rallied again, to the amazement of her doctors. <lb/>
The measure of her pain and discipline was not yet full. <lb/>
One who was constantly with her wrote: "I shall never <lb/>
forget the unselfishness, brightness, and patience with which <lb/>
she bore her long trial. Her sufferings were sad to see; but <lb/>
even when she was moaning with pain, which she said was <lb/>
like the cutting of a knife, she would go on dictating &lpar;her <lb/>
letters&rpar; as best she could between her moans.&hellip; Her <lb/>
sorrow was that she could not realise God's presence more, <lb/>
and her fear was, lest she should seem impatient.&hellip; I <lb/>
feel that I cannot give you any true idea of those last hours <lb/>
that I spent with her, as her brave and loving spirit waited <lb/>
for the moment when God would call her to the full, <lb/>
unclouded daylight of eternity, into the dawn of which she <lb/>
seemed already to have entered."</p>
<pb n="250" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0273"/>
<p>During the last three weeks of her life the course of <lb/>
circulation in her right arm became impeded, and it swelled <lb/>
so painfully that it had to be supported with a cushion. <lb/>
In addition to her other complaint, she suffered from <lb/>
consolidation of the right lung, which caused impeded <lb/>
respiration and distressing cough. But as she sat propped <lb/>
up by pillows she seemed to regain her youthful beauty, <lb/>
and only the touch of white in her hair testified to her age. <lb/>
On Saturday, December 21st, the end seemed approaching, <lb/>
and Sister Dora's depression increased; it was the last time, <lb/>
and her faith triumphed. "I never saw such faith and <lb/>
patience," was the testimony of one of her nurses. On the <lb/>
morning of the 24th she said, "I am dying; run for Sister <lb/>
Ellen." In the biography we read that her faithful attendant <lb/>
"Mrs. H. tried to soothe her, saying, 'Our Blessed Lord is <lb/>
standing at the gates of heaven to open them for you.' But <lb/>
she no longer needed such consolation, for all her darkness <lb/>
was gone, and she answered, 'I see Him there; the gates <lb/>
are opened wide.'&hellip; When all human efforts for her relief <lb/>
were exhausted," it continues, "she said, as they stood <lb/>
watching her, 'I have lived alone; let me die alone,' <reg orig="re-|peating">repeating</reg> <lb/>
'let me die alone,' till they were forced to leave her, <lb/>
one friend only watching through the half-open door."</p>
<p>They laid her to rest in Walsall Cemetery on December 28th. <lb/>
No one who was present will ever forget that sight. In spite <lb/>
of half-melting snow and drizzling rain, hundreds of old <lb/>
patients followed, until almost the whole of the population <lb/>
seemed to join the procession. There were four workhouse <lb/>
funerals at the same time, and the service was read over all <lb/>
five at once. There was no room in the chapel, and Sister <lb/>
Dora's coffin was placed in the porch; as one of the nurses <lb/>
remarked, "that was just as Sister Dora would have wished&mdash; <lb/>
not to be divided, even in death, from the poor people she <lb/>
loved so well." The inscription on the coffin was: "Sister <lb/>
Dora. Entered into rest 24th December, 1878." Her <lb/>
<pb n="251" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0274"/>
great wish to sing her Christmas carol in heaven had been <lb/>
granted her.</p>
<p>Seldom has a more beautiful life been lived upon this <lb/>
earth. It was spent in the service of Christ's poor, in <lb/>
ministering to the sick, the sorrowful, and the sinful. Can <lb/>
we doubt that to her the blessed words have been said: <lb/>
"Inasmuch as ye did it unto the least of these My brethren, <lb/>
ye did it unto Me."</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">In</hi> writing even a brief sketch, a mere outline, of some <lb/>
living worker, one is generally met at the outset by <lb/>
a bristling phalanx of prejudices or difficulties, and must <lb/>
perforce tread gingerly, with nervous tremour and some <lb/>
degree of trepidation, over the debatable ground. A feeling <lb/>
of reverence, of delicacy, impedes the conscientious writer. <lb/>
The anxiety not to say too much, the fear that we may say <lb/>
too little, hampers one with a feeling of constraint. If <lb/>
we could speak out from our hearts, if we could boldly <lb/>
utter our good words and golden opinions, if we could cry <lb/>
"Well done!" <hi rend="italic">"bravissima!"</hi> with the multitude, our task <lb/>
would seem so easy, and there would be no need to weigh <lb/>
our sentences.</p>
<p>Dean Goulburn once said to a friend who was about to <lb/>
<pb n="256" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0281"/>
write a biography: "I would bear in mind brevity <reg orig="through-|out">throughout</reg>. <lb/>
People will not tolerate lengthy biographies. Give <lb/>
the readers the plums, and nothing else." The advice was <lb/>
good, although it was couched in somewhat novel language; <lb/>
most readers like their plums to be as accessible as possible.</p>
<p>In writing of the notable women of the Victorian era, one <lb/>
figure stands out in strong and prominent relief as a typical <lb/>
worker of the nineteenth century&mdash;Agnes Elizabeth Weston <lb/>
the Seamen's Friend&mdash;and no work is more widely known, or <lb/>
appeals more forcibly to our English hearts, than her <reg orig="self-|denying">self-denying</reg> <lb/>
labours for her beloved Blue Jackets.</p>
<p>"Doe y<hi rend="super">e</hi> nexte thynge" was certainly Miss Weston's <lb/>
motto; for step by step, as the way opened, the devoted <lb/>
worker was led from small beginnings to vast fields of work.</p>
<p>"The harvest truly is plenteous, but the labourers are <lb/>
few," said the Divine Master; "pray ye therefore the Lord <lb/>
of the harvest that He will send forth labourers into His <lb/>
harvest."</p>
<p>The golden harvest fields are always ready and waiting <lb/>
to be reaped, the vintage is always ripe for the wine-press, <lb/>
but how few are the labourers! Still, thank God, here and <lb/>
there some brave strong workers step into the breach, ready <lb/>
with all their hearts to "do the next thing."</p>
<p>A short but most interesting account of Miss Weston's <lb/>
life and work has been written by her friend and <reg orig="fellow-|worker">fellow-worker</reg>, <lb/>
Miss Wintz, from which it will be necessary to quote <lb/>
freely. From it we learn that Miss Weston was born in <lb/>
London, and that her father was a barrister and a fellow <lb/>
of several learned societies. The family pedigree of the <lb/>
Westons passed, without a broken link, to the time of the <lb/>
Conquest, when the Norman founder of the house came <lb/>
over with William the Conqueror, and, receiving gifts of <lb/>
manors and lands, became Raoul de Bailleul de Weston. <lb/>
The family removed to Bath, and here Agnes Weston spent <lb/>
her girlhood. The early influences and environment of her <lb/>
<pb n="257" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0282"/>
young days were singularly favourable, and her own words <lb/>
were: "Woe to me if, with such a father and mother, and <lb/>
such home influences, I had been aught than a child of God <lb/>
and a worker in His vineyard!"</p>
<p>Although, like St. Augustine, the child of many prayers, <lb/>
Agnes Weston was for some years the source of anxiety to <lb/>
her parents. She was strong-willed, impulsive and <reg orig="pas-|sionate">passionate</reg> <lb/>
in temper, and careless on matters of religion. <lb/>
"I put away the truth deliberately from me," she once <lb/>
wrote, "and the marvel is how the Good Shepherd <lb/>
followed me up."</p>
<p>But in 1856, when she was sixteen, a change came over <lb/>
the young girl, and in reading of her experience, one is <lb/>
reminded of Elizabeth Fry, sitting in the front of the gallery <lb/>
at "Goat's" in her "new purple boots, laced in scarlet," <lb/>
when William Savery, the American Friend, began to preach. <lb/>
In both cases it was through "the foolishness of preaching" <lb/>
that the good seed was sown and brought forth rich fruit, <lb/>
and it was the faithful and vigorous preaching of the Rev. <lb/>
James Fleming, at that time incumbent of All Saints' Chapel, <lb/>
Bath, that first attracted Agnes Weston's wondering attention. <lb/>
She began to listen and to think; then came storm and <lb/>
conflict. Like many other strong natures, Agnes Weston <lb/>
did not attain to peace and victory without long years of <lb/>
fighting and struggle. Doubts and misgivings haunted her, <lb/>
but her proud reserved spirit kept its own counsel. Still, <lb/>
the fierce mental storms through which she passed helped <lb/>
her to understand and sympathise with others who were <lb/>
similarly tried.</p>
<p>Ten years of sunshine and cloud intervened before the <lb/>
clear, unshadowed light dawned on her waiting soul. Truly <lb/>
she could say, with St. Augustine, "Thou hast made us, <lb/>
O Lord, for Thyself, and the soul is restless till it resteth <lb/>
in Thee."</p>
<p>It was during these days of storm and stress that Miss <lb/>
<pb n="258" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0283"/>
Weston threw herself into the study of music and <reg orig="organ-|playing">organ-playing</reg>. <lb/>
She studied for some time under Mr. J. K. Pyne, <lb/>
then organist of the Abbey Church, Bath; and he then <lb/>
suggested that she should place herself under the teaching <lb/>
of the celebrated organist and composer, Dr. S. S. Wesley, <lb/>
of Gloucester Cathedral. Dr. Wesley was not accustomed <lb/>
to train amateurs, but at Mr. Pyne's request he consented <lb/>
to meet Miss Weston in a certain church at Cheltenham. <lb/>
Miss Weston having arrived first at the rendezvous, made <lb/>
her way to the organ loft, and commenced playing one of <lb/>
Bach's pedal fugues, little knowing that Dr. Wesley was <lb/>
listening to her. Miss Wintz gives us the result of the <lb/>
interview. "As soon as the fugue came to a close, he <lb/>
walked into the organ loft, and without introduction said, <lb/>
'I have heard enough; I will teach you. But do you wish <lb/>
to learn as an amateur?' 'No,' was her immediate answer, <lb/>
'I want as sharp training as you would give to a <reg orig="profes-|sional">professional</reg>.' <lb/>
'You shall have it,' said he, smiling grimly. <lb/>
'Come back with me to Gloucester, and I will ask the Dean <lb/>
and Chapter to allow you to study on the cathedral organ.' <lb/>
Scarcely a day now passed for some weeks that she was not <lb/>
found rousing the echoes of Gloucester Cathedral, practising <lb/>
morning, noon, and till long after dark, spite of all the <lb/>
ghostly stories narrated by vergers and fellow-pupils."</p>
<p>On her return from Gloucester her father presented her <lb/>
with an organ, which was put up for her use in the new <lb/>
country house he had just built on Lansdowne, near Bath. <lb/>
"Ensleigh," or End-of-the-Sea, was Agnes Weston's home <lb/>
for many years. It was situated on one of the highest hills, <lb/>
the downs stretching behind it. In front the view was very <lb/>
fine: one looked over a beautiful valley to a grand range of <lb/>
hills, "and on again from range to range, till about twenty <lb/>
miles away the panorama is closed by the chalk downs of <lb/>
Wiltshire and the edge of Salisbury Plain; while far below <lb/>
rise the tower and roofs of the old city of Bath."</p>
<pb n="259" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0284"/>
<p>Such was the lovely home which Miss Weston left with <lb/>
such regret in after-years, when her work called her to a <lb/>
very different sphere; and no doubt the beauty of her <lb/>
environment and the fine bracing moors and air were of <lb/>
great benefit, and helped to endow her with that physical <lb/>
strength, vigour and energy which were such important <lb/>
factors in her life-work. The instrument was being trained; <lb/>
soon it was ready for use, and "Doe y<hi rend="super">e</hi> nexte thinge" <lb/>
became the result.</p>
<p>In the early part of the year 1868, through the kindness <lb/>
of the chaplain, the Rev. E. J. Wright, she received <reg orig="permis-|sion">permission</reg> <lb/>
to visit the patients at the Bath United Hospital.</p>
<p>With the ardent zeal of a generous nature she desired to <lb/>
share her blessings with others. She had wrestled through <lb/>
the darkness, and her storm-tossed soul was now safely <lb/>
anchored in its haven of peace; and, like the great-hearted <lb/>
Apostle, she too longed to say, "that we may be able to <lb/>
comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort <lb/>
wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God." By-and-by <lb/>
she gave a short address in each of the men's wards once <lb/>
a week. She would then go from bed to bed, and speak to <lb/>
each man, accompanying her words by little gifts of flowers <lb/>
and books. On one occasion, during the brief service a <lb/>
poor fellow was brought in terribly crushed by an accident <lb/>
in the stone quarries. The case was pronounced hopeless, <lb/>
and Miss Weston, much distressed, begged for permission to <lb/>
speak to him! It was granted, with the remark, "that as <lb/>
he would never be conscious again in this world, it mattered <lb/>
little what she said to him." Putting her hand gently on <lb/>
the dying man's shoulder, she repeated the text, "God so <lb/>
loved the world, that He gave His only-begotten Son, that <lb/>
whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have <lb/>
everlasting life." "After a short pause she repeated it again. <lb/>
He moved slightly, and big tears rolled down his rough <lb/>
cheeks. This was the only answer she received; but who <lb/>
<pb n="260" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0285"/>
can say what passed at that moment between that soul and <lb/>
its God?"</p>
<p>Many interesting incidents from real life were turned to <lb/>
account, and made the subject of tracts by Miss Weston. <lb/>
These obtained a large circulation. She continued her <lb/>
work at the Sunday-school, and unmanageable boys were <lb/>
always drafted into her class. By-and-by the senior boys' <lb/>
class developed into a class for working men, until they <lb/>
reached the average of a hundred each Sunday afternoon. <lb/>
In this work she was assisted by the Rev. Canon Bernard, <lb/>
rector of Walcot, who allowed her the use of the parish <lb/>
schoolroom. Afterwards she rented a mission room in the <lb/>
east of Walcot, which became the centre of her work&mdash; <lb/>
working men's Bible classes and prayer-meetings, temperance <lb/>
and Band of Hope work.</p>
<p>Although greatly interested in temperance work, Miss <lb/>
Weston did not herself become a total abstainer for some <lb/>
time. A rather singular circumstance induced her to sign <lb/>
the pledge. A notorious drunkard came to her at one of <lb/>
the temperance meetings, and wished to sign the pledge. <lb/>
As he took up the pen he said to her suddenly, "If you <lb/>
please, Miss Weston, be you a teetotaller?" Somewhat <lb/>
disconcerted by this appeal, she replied "that she only took <lb/>
a glass of wine occasionally, in strict moderation." "Well," <lb/>
returned the man, laying down the pen, "I think I will do <lb/>
just as you say, take a glass sometimes in moderation," <lb/>
and nothing would induce him to sign the total abstinence <lb/>
pledge. He went back to his old life, saying that "he <lb/>
would do as the lady did."</p>
<p>"That night," observed Miss Weston, "I saw my duty <lb/>
very plainly, and I enrolled my name in the pledge book, <lb/>
heartily wishing that I had done so before this poor fellow <lb/>
came forward."</p>
<p>Miss Weston gives us in her own words a valuable <lb/>
testimony as to the salutary effect of total abstinence. <lb/>
<pb n="261" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0286"/>
"Although I have worked harder with brain, muscle and <lb/>
nerve than I ever worked before, travelling thousands of <lb/>
miles, frequently holding two meetings a day, and standing <lb/>
at the helm of the large ship entrusted to my care, I may <lb/>
safely say that I have never enjoyed better health. Rest <lb/>
and food are the only doctors which I have had to employ."</p>
<p>The 2nd Somerset Militia assembled every year at Bath <lb/>
for training, and in conjunction with the chaplain, and with <lb/>
the colonel's permission, coffee and reading-rooms for the <lb/>
use of the men were started, and a popular meeting <lb/>
arranged every evening, consisting of songs, readings and <lb/>
addresses.</p>
<p>Miss Weston also undertook a Sunday Bible-class, <lb/>
and one of the officers remarked, "Since Miss Weston <lb/>
has taken the men in hand, and kept them out of the <lb/>
public-houses, they are not like the same fellows." At the <lb/>
close of the training she presented each man with a New <lb/>
Testament. This interesting work among the men of the <lb/>
2nd Somerset Militia has been taken up and carried on by <lb/>
her sister.</p>
<p>Many people have wondered when and how Miss Weston <lb/>
first commenced her noble work among sailors. "It can be <lb/>
traced back to small beginnings"; it was just doing the next <lb/>
thing that came to hand. "In the early part of 1868," she <lb/>
relates in one of her published statements, "I wrote a letter <lb/>
to a Christian soldier then on passage with his regiment <lb/>
from England to India in H.M.S. <hi rend="italic">Crocodile</hi>, one of Her <lb/>
Majesty's troop ships. He read and re-read it, and finding <lb/>
comfort and help from its words of Christian sympathy, he <lb/>
showed it to a seaman. The seaman's eyes glistened as he <lb/>
handed back the letter with this remark: 'That is good; <lb/>
we poor fellows have no friend. Do you think that lady <lb/>
would write to me? I would give anything to receive a <lb/>
letter like this.' 'I am sure that she will,' replied the <lb/>
soldier. 'I will write and ask her.' He did so, dating his <lb/>
<pb n="262" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0287"/>
letter from Suez My heart was rejoiced at finding <reg orig="some-|thing">something</reg> <lb/>
ever so small to do for Jesus, and I replied at once. <lb/>
That letter was the germ of all my present work in the <lb/>
service. For any ability in the letter-writing way I have <lb/>
to thank the Carus Wilson Soldiers' Friend Society, who <lb/>
supplied me with the names of Christian soldiers with whom <lb/>
I could correspond.</p>
<p>Miss Weston's letter to the seaman brought a grateful <lb/>
reply, enclosing the names of many sailors who would <lb/>
be glad of a letter. Every week the correspondence grew <lb/>
larger. Friendships were made with hundreds of Blue <lb/>
Jackets in this simple way. "We never light our pipes <lb/>
with your letters," wrote one sailor, "because you thinks <lb/>
about and cares for us."</p>
<p>The demand for written letters became so great that Miss <lb/>
Weston was obliged to supplement them with a monthly <lb/>
printed one, which enabled her to reach a greater number of <lb/>
men. During the first year of issue 500 copies a month were <lb/>
sent to individual men. In February 1872, 1,500 copies were <lb/>
forwarded each month. The circulation increased steadily <lb/>
to 21,000, at which figure it now stands. Miss Weston's <lb/>
desire is to speak to each man alone. The title is as <lb/>
follows:&mdash;"A Monthly Letter addressed to the Seamen, <lb/>
Marines, and Marine Artillery of the Royal Navy at Home <lb/>
and Abroad."</p>
<p>The whole of the navy now receives these little messengers <lb/>
monthly. They are sent to the royal naval hospitals at <lb/>
Haslar, Plymouth, and Chatham; the coastguard stations <lb/>
have been added, and through the kindness of the Trinity <lb/>
Board she also sends to all the English lighthouses.</p>
<p>After a time Miss Weston found it necessary to bring out <lb/>
a monthly letter for the boys also. Some lads from H.M.S. <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Impregnable</hi> came to her as a deputation from the rest <lb/>
with this request: "Please, ma'am, do you think that <lb/>
you could write us boys a letter all to ourselves? we don't <lb/>
<pb n="263" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0288"/>
understand the men's." The boys' wish was granted: <lb/>
500 copies a month were issued: but they soon rose to <lb/>
thousands, and gave great pleasure to the lads, of whom <lb/>
there are some two thousand at Devonport, and several <lb/>
hundred at Falmouth on board H.M.S. <hi rend="italic">Ganges</hi>, at <reg orig="Ports-|mouth">Portsmouth</reg> <lb/>
on board H.M.S. <hi rend="italic">St. Vincent</hi>, and at Portland on <lb/>
board H.M.S. <hi rend="italic">Boscawen</hi>. The "Monthly Letters" are <lb/>
sent in sackfuls to the Post Office, to be distributed all over <lb/>
the world to every ship in the service.</p>
<p>To give an idea of the work, "the cost of printing and <lb/>
sending Monthly Letters, salaries of evangelists and <reg orig="Bible-|women">Bible-women</reg>, <lb/>
postage, temperance and gospel work afloat, relief <lb/>
of destitute seamen, etc., averages &pound;4000 a year."</p>
<p>"In the year 1873 the National Temperance League <lb/>
having undertaken temperance work in the Royal Navy, Miss <lb/>
Weston willingly promised to superintend and carry it on <lb/>
for them." She at once commenced the work with her <lb/>
usual energy. The first step was to get permission to <lb/>
speak to the men on board their ship. Here etiquette <lb/>
and prejudice were against her, but a friend, Admiral Sir <lb/>
W. King Hall, K.C.B., then Admiral Superintendent of the <lb/>
Dockyard at Devonport, came to her help. He stipulated <lb/>
that she should give a short address to the dockyard men at <lb/>
their dinner-time, and that he and his chaplain should be <lb/>
among the listeners. The result was that word was passed <lb/>
to all the ships in the harbour: "Don't be afraid to let <lb/>
Miss Weston come on board and speak to your ship's <lb/>
company; I'll stand security for her." These meetings held <lb/>
on board of a warship by a lady are unique. One of her <lb/>
earliest ones was on board H.M.S. <hi rend="italic">St. Vincent</hi>, a training <lb/>
ship for boys.</p>
<p>Miss Weston describes the scene in her own graphic <lb/>
way. "I gave them all a good talking-to. The moon <lb/>
struggling through the clouds, the shadowy tracery of the <lb/>
masts and rigging, the outlines of the old <hi rend="italic">Victory</hi> and the <lb/>
<pb n="264" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0289"/>
<hi rend="italic">Duke of Wellington</hi>, the lights gleaming from the ports on <lb/>
the water, and the crowd of young Blue Jackets below, was <lb/>
a scene never to be forgotten. There were at least five <lb/>
hundred upturned faces, all listening with eager attention to <lb/>
every word that was spoken, and coming forward in crowds <lb/>
at the close to sign the temperance pledge."</p>
<p>The value of these meetings cannot be overrated, or the <lb/>
importance of gathering such large numbers of men together, <lb/>
and they have given Miss Weston "a hold upon the navy <lb/>
which she never could have gained in any other way."</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Miss weston's</hi> work among the sailors at Devonport <lb/>
commenced in a very simple way. On Sunday <lb/>
afternoons, while staying with a friend in the neighbourhood, <lb/>
her attention was drawn to the immense numbers of sailor <lb/>
lads on leave from the training ships who were wandering <lb/>
aimlessly about the streets, getting into bad company. <lb/>
Feeling anxious to get a hold on them, she consulted some <lb/>
officers in the service about the best way to assemble them <lb/>
together; but their answer was by no means encouraging. <lb/>
"They are as restless when they come ashore as birds let <lb/>
out of a cage; they like to roam about, and you will never <lb/>
be able to collect them."</p>
<p>This was damping, but Miss Weston was not to be <lb/>
daunted; even in the face of these difficulties the plan was <lb/>
to be tried. She distributed notices, and invited the lads to <lb/>
meet her in a large public room in Devonport for singing <lb/>
and reading on Sunday afternoon. The first Sunday, after <lb/>
waiting for two hours, only one boy appeared, but he was <lb/>
too frightened to stay without his companions. The <reg orig="follow-|ing">following</reg> <lb/>
Sunday not one came, and after spending four Sunday <lb/>
afternoons in this discouraging way she returned home much <lb/>
<pb n="266" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0291"/>
disheartened, but still unwilling to give it up. She made it <lb/>
a matter of earnest prayer and thought, and unexpected help <lb/>
came. Mrs. Wintz with whom she was staying, offered her <lb/>
kitchen, with tea and cake as an attraction.</p>
<p>Two earnest men, one an employ&eacute; in H.M. dockyard, <lb/>
and the other a member of the Metropolitan Police, offered <lb/>
to go out and beat up recruits. About a dozen lads were <lb/>
brought in, and the tea, cake and warm kitchen were such <lb/>
attractions that the numbers were soon augmented.</p>
<p>Miss Wintz in her narrative gives a pleasing sketch of one <lb/>
of these sailor lads, Arthur Phillips, who became a regular <lb/>
attendant at the meetings, and whose short, bright young <lb/>
life was so suddenly cut off. "Well, we are crowded out," <lb/>
he would say; "we shall soon have to ask God to give us a <lb/>
larger place, Miss Weston." And when he was drafted into <lb/>
a sea-going ship his last words were, "Never mind, it is <lb/>
God's will; my Saviour will be with me, and as soon as we <lb/>
come into Plymouth Sound again, I shall be up at these dear <lb/>
old meetings like a shot."</p>
<p>Alas! before many months had passed, the news of his <lb/>
death reached his friends. He had been in the habit of <lb/>
going to the bag-racks during the dinner-hour for private <lb/>
prayer, and was climbing down the ladder, when he fell <lb/>
through an open hatchway, the hatch of the chain-locker <lb/>
having been accidentally left open, and was instantly <lb/>
killed. The ship's company erected a tablet to his memory <lb/>
in Bebington Cemetery, near Rock Ferry, Liverpool, with <lb/>
the following inscription:&mdash; <lb/>
<q><hi rend="small-caps">In Memory Of</hi> <lb/>
ARTHUR PHILLIPS, <lb/>
<hi rend="small-caps">Seaman Of</hi> H.M.S. <hi rend="small-caps">Triumph</hi>, <lb/>
<hi rend="small-caps">Aged</hi> 18 <hi rend="small-caps">Years</hi>.</q>
<q>Who was killed by an accidental fall on board the said ship on the <lb/>
15th July, 1874, during the visit of the Channel Squadron to Liverpool. <lb/>
His remains are interred near this spot, and this memorial is erected by <lb/>
his shipmates to testify their esteem for the consistent Christian conduct <lb/>
he always manifested. Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord.</q></p>
<pb n="267" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0292"/>
<p>"Dear lad," wrote his friend, Miss Wintz, "his was indeed <lb/>
a simple, earnest faith, and to his prayers may be traced all <lb/>
the great work which was the outcome of that small kitchen <lb/>
meeting."</p>
<p>Time went on. Miss Weston secured a room in a good <lb/>
situation close to one of the landing-places, and it soon filled <lb/>
with boys. It is a well-known fact that sailors are restless <lb/>
by nature and have a good share of quicksilver, and Miss <lb/>
Weston gave an amusing account of her difficulty of keeping <lb/>
the boys' attention. About two hundred lads were collected, <lb/>
and one afternoon had been fairly quiet during the singing. <lb/>
"I opened my Bible," she went on, "searched for chapter <lb/>
and verse, while my audience, not being interested, began <lb/>
to think of beating a retreat. I heard a slight noise, looked <lb/>
up, and the whole assembly was in motion, some running over <lb/>
the backs of the benches like cats, some slipping underneath. <lb/>
In less than a minute the room was cleared except about a <lb/>
dozen on the front bench who had not been quick enough <lb/>
to fall in with the rest. I was, of course, put on my mettle <lb/>
to keep this small remnant of the scattered forces, and <lb/>
did so. The sailor boys had taught me a most valuable <lb/>
lesson, that the grand thing is to get the attention of your <lb/>
audience; and I must say for our lads, that, once gain <lb/>
their attention, and a more interested audience cannot be <lb/>
met with."</p>
<p>As the work increased, the question arose, "Can't we have <lb/>
a house to which we could come in the week&mdash;a temperance <lb/>
house;" in a word, "a public house without the drink," close <lb/>
to the dockyard. We are informed "that the temperance men <lb/>
clamoured for a temperance headquarters, and the Christian <lb/>
men for a religious headquarters, and they carried the day." <lb/>
"But for the pressure brought to bear upon me," Miss <lb/>
Weston has often remarked, "I do not know that I ever <lb/>
should have started the Institute."</p>
<p>Little by little the way opened. In the autumn of 1874 a <lb/>
<pb n="268" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0293"/>
suitable house became vacant in Fore Street, a main <lb/>
thoroughfare leading direct to the great gateway of the <lb/>
Royal Dockyard. It was scarcely a dozen steps from the <lb/>
gate, had extensive premises at the back and a good <lb/>
frontage, and was substantially built. A short appeal in the <lb/>
columns of the Christian brought Miss Weston in a few days <lb/>
a sufficient sum to pay a year's rent. Money continued to <lb/>
flow in, until that noble sum of nearly &pound;6000 was collected, <lb/>
which bought and fitted up the Sailors' Rest and Institute. <lb/>
The boys in the training ships saved up their coppers, and <lb/>
men put aside their grog money, and Miss Weston herself <lb/>
travelled hundreds of miles to lay the case before the public. <lb/>
There was a great deal to be done before the place in Fore <lb/>
Street could be used, "old warehouses to be cleared away, <lb/>
a coal-shed and small yard to be converted into a hall, an <lb/>
oilstore into a sailors' dining and sitting-room, and the dingy <lb/>
old shop wreathed with cobwebs transmogrified into a bright <lb/>
attractive bar."</p>
<p>The opening day came at last, and on May 8th, 1876, the <lb/>
doors were thrown open at five o'clock in the morning, and <lb/>
business commenced.</p>
<p>The previous evening the Hall had been filled by people <lb/>
of all denominations, and prayer had been offered "for <lb/>
God's blessing on the building." "The 8th of May was a <lb/>
glorious day," Miss Wintz tells us in her interesting <lb/>
account, "one of the brightest of that sunny month; the <lb/>
servants were up with the lark, but the coffee was hardly <lb/>
hot, and the bread and butter and cakes scarcely cut, before <lb/>
an impatient knocking outside made it very evident that <lb/>
there would be no lack of customers that day. In they <lb/>
came with a rush, and for an hour the popular saying was <lb/>
true, that 'one might have walked on the men's heads.' <lb/>
Sailors just going to catch their boats, dockyard men going <lb/>
to their work in the yard, policemen come in from their <lb/>
night's round, were all glad to get a cup of hot tea, coffee, <lb/>
<pb n="269" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0294"/>
or cocoa and a roll; and for the remainder of the day there <lb/>
was but little cessation from the stir and bustle of the <lb/>
morning."</p>
<p>The day preceding the opening, three man-of-war's men <lb/>
asked to see Miss Weston, and requested to occupy the new <lb/>
dormitories that night. When she objected that the <reg orig="build-|ing">building</reg> <lb/>
had not been formally opened, they replied, "Couldn't <lb/>
you throw the red tape overboard for once, Ma'am? for we've <lb/>
all three got leave from our captain on purpose to sleep <lb/>
here to-night."</p>
<p>The account goes on: "The red tape was thrown <reg orig="over-|board">overboard</reg>, <lb/>
and has never been restored again." The men <lb/>
showed themselves deserving of the kindness, for when the <lb/>
attendant returned from taking them over to the dormitories, <lb/>
he said: "We've got three birds of the right sort here to begin <lb/>
with. When I showed them their room they shut the door, <lb/>
and in a minute I heard one of them reading. I listened: <lb/>
it was from the Bible, and then they knelt down and <lb/>
prayed, and it did my heart good to hear them!" Their <lb/>
photographs are still hanging up, and they have, like the <lb/>
birds, "returned to roost in their own nest whenever <lb/>
they could manage to do so."</p>
<p>No pressure to attend the meetings was brought to bear <lb/>
on the men, but the Hall, with its music and bright services, <lb/>
was close by. In the bar, among the syrups and good <lb/>
things, lies the pledge-book with pen and ink, and many a <lb/>
kind word is said by the servers, which lead to many a <lb/>
signature.</p>
<p>The Hall and the Institute are two departments, distinct <lb/>
yet united. "The Hall, with its evangelistic work, <reg orig="prayer-|meetings">prayer-meetings</reg>, <lb/>
Bible-classes, gatherings for sailors' wives and <lb/>
children, temperance work of all kinds, and the Institute, <lb/>
with its refreshment bar, reading, recreation, smoking, <lb/>
dining- and sitting-rooms, containing papers, books, and <lb/>
writing material, both linked indissolubly together, and all <lb/>
<pb n="270" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0295"/>
difficulties have been solved in practice by using what Lord <lb/>
Kintore called "sanctified common-sense."</p>
<p>The "public-house without drink" is not only a <reg orig="com-|fortable">comfortable</reg> <lb/>
home of refreshment to sailors, but also to sailors' <lb/>
wives. The opening of the bar has been very successful, for <lb/>
during the first year &pound;1,998 was taken over the counter.</p>
<p>The boys have a separate department, and an entrance <lb/>
into their own coffee bar. Their reading and recreation room <lb/>
is magnificent as to size and brightness. "It is 'boys, <lb/>
boys, everywhere,' a real home for them when they come <lb/>
ashore, and a place of safety which much rejoices their <lb/>
mothers' hearts.</p>
<p>Sailors are fond of giving nicknames. "We call it the <lb/>
Sailors' Nest, the Three C's," a Blue Jacket once informed <lb/>
an officer in the Navy. "We say one to another, 'Well, Jack, <lb/>
are you going to "The Three C's" to-night?' We don't <lb/>
mean any harm by it, sir, it's a real good meaning; it means <lb/>
'coffee, comfort and company,' and if a man's got good <lb/>
coffee, comfort and plenty of good company, it goes a long <lb/>
way to keep him from what's wrong."</p>
<p>Good work has been done among the boys. A petty officer <lb/>
once told Miss Weston of a most interesting fact that had <lb/>
come under his notice. "I was going round the ship," he <lb/>
said, "when I came upon a dozen boys with a ship's lantern. <lb/>
I thought they were up to mischief, and watched them <reg orig="with-|out">without</reg> <lb/>
their seeing me. The boy with the lantern held it so <lb/>
that the light shone on his book: it was the Bible; he read <lb/>
a few verses out of it, then shut the book, set down the <lb/>
lantern, and they all knelt round it in a circle, and one and <lb/>
another prayed. I found that they met like this every night, <lb/>
and I thought it would do your heart good to hear about it, <lb/>
Miss, as it did me to listen to them; they are boys who come <lb/>
up to 'The Sailors' Rest,' and they say they learnt to love <lb/>
Jesus there."</p>
<p>Years passed away, and the work at the Sailors' Rest went <lb/>
<pb n="271" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0296"/>
on; but it became too small for the crowd of occupants. <lb/>
"Do shake out a reef, Miss Weston," pleaded the men. <lb/>
"We must have a bigger place; we often have to look out <lb/>
the softest plank to sleep."</p>
<p>The men were right; but what was to be done? Common <lb/>
sense said: "Get larger quarters and more accommodation <lb/>
close to the dockyard gate"; but, alas, the public-house <lb/>
trade was in possession. Five public-houses and a <reg orig="pawn-|shop">pawnshop</reg> <lb/>
stood in a row, and next door to the Sailors' Rest were <lb/>
three more blocking the way. The matter was made the <lb/>
subject for earnest prayer.</p>
<p>One morning a letter was received with an Italian-stamp <lb/>
and the postmark Fiume, and out dropped a cheque for <lb/>
&pound;1000. "This noble sum," Miss Wintz informs us, "came <lb/>
from Mr. Robert Whitehead, inventor of the Whitehead <lb/>
torpedo; and, as the Blue Jackets said, 'a better torpedo had <lb/>
never been fired.'" The late Mrs. Langworthy, of <reg orig="Man-|chester">Manchester</reg>, <lb/>
also gave &pound;1000, and in large sums and small, <lb/>
from a &pound;1000 to one penny, the money came in, and the <lb/>
public-houses one by one capitulated. The last to give in <lb/>
was the "Dock Gates Inn," next to the dockyard; but one <lb/>
fine morning this stronghold struck its flag, and Miss <lb/>
Weston describes her feelings of gratitude to God when the <lb/>
keys were brought in and laid on her table, and she was the <lb/>
owner of three of the worst public-houses in Devonport.</p>
<p>The ground was cleared and the new building erected, <lb/>
funds still flowing in to cover expenses. The frontage of <lb/>
the new Sailors' Rest is most imposing. "A fine coffee bar, <lb/>
with sailor-boys' room and reading-rooms, cover the ground <lb/>
space, while tier upon tier of dormitories tower above." A <lb/>
side door near the coffee bar leads to a large smoking-room. <lb/>
Ascending the broad staircase, the visitor is shown some <lb/>
small comfortable rooms good enough for an officer, which <lb/>
can be taken for a small rental. Next comes a quiet <lb/>
reading- and smoking-room, and beyond this apartment <lb/>
<pb n="272" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0297"/>
come the cabins. This floor communicates by a door <lb/>
with Miss Weston's private house, and includes a <reg orig="book-|room">book-room</reg>.</p>
<p>The cabins are bright and airy. Each man has a tiny <lb/>
room to himself, in which is a bed, chair, some pictures and <lb/>
texts, pegs for his clothes, and a strip of carpet. Many of <lb/>
these are memorial cabins; the sum of thirty guineas <reg orig="consti-|tutes">constitutes</reg> <lb/>
the endowment. These tiny retreats are much prized <lb/>
by the men, who have no quiet place they can call their <lb/>
own on board ship. It is interesting to read some of the <lb/>
names of the cabins. One has the name of "Ruby," <lb/>
another "Diamond," a third "Undaunted," and a fourth <lb/>
"Volage," all after ships of their name. One cabin is <lb/>
called "Little Nan," another "Harry," both in memory of <lb/>
some dear one. The cabin given by the Duchess of <lb/>
Manchester and her husband, Sir Arthur Blackwood, bears <lb/>
simply the text, "My life is hid with Christ in God," those <lb/>
words having been the means of his own conversion.</p>
<p>The Blue Jackets enjoy their clean, comfortable beds, and <lb/>
look forward to a good sleep on shore with delight, as at sea <lb/>
their hardships are often very great.</p>
<p>"The Sailors' Rest as it stands, with sleeping <reg orig="accommo-|dation">accommodation</reg> <lb/>
for over four hundred men, is probably the finest <lb/>
Blue Jackets' coffee palace in the world."</p>
<p>Her Royal and Imperial Highness the Duchess of <lb/>
Edinburgh, accompanied by the Duke, have visited the <lb/>
Sailors' Rest; and, still more recently, the Prince of Wales. <lb/>
On this occasion the Duke of Edinburgh accompanied his <lb/>
brother, and pointed out all the objects of interest. The <lb/>
Prince was highly delighted with all he saw, and greatly <lb/>
admired the cabins. He wrote the following entry in the <lb/>
visitors' book: "I am much impressed by the admirable <lb/>
management and excellence of this institution.&mdash;<hi rend="small-caps">Albert <lb/>
Edward</hi>." And he graciously consented to associate his <lb/>
name with Miss Weston's work.</p>
<pb n="273" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0298"/>
<p>It might be imagined that the energetic worker would <lb/>
have been satisfied with the vast area of work that lay <lb/>
before her in Devonport; but her wide sympathies were <lb/>
ready to embrace other spheres also. It had always been <lb/>
her intention that as soon as she was free from debt at <lb/>
Devonport, something should be done at Portsmouth, the <lb/>
great naval arsenal of England. Crowds of seamen thronged <lb/>
the Commercial Road, in the northern part of Portsmouth, <lb/>
near the new extension works. Here a small house with a <lb/>
hall at the back, that had been a theatre, was taken. "A <lb/>
tiny bar and reading-room, with a little back parlour, and <lb/>
the concert hall, with two small rooms for Miss Weston, a <lb/>
bedroom or two, and a room for the manager, were all the <lb/>
stock in trade." Here the work was begun and carried on, <lb/>
until a gentleman owning some property in the heart of the <lb/>
town, offered a fine site at a reasonable price.</p>
<p>As in the Devonport work, the matter was made the <reg orig="sub-|ject">subject</reg> <lb/>
of anxious thought and prayer; and, as before, help was <lb/>
sent. Anthony Denny, Esq., offered his house for a <reg orig="drawing-|room">drawing-room</reg> <lb/>
meeting, and sent a cheque for a thousand guineas. <lb/>
This formed the foundation stone of the new Sailors' Rest <lb/>
in Commercial Road. There is a graphic description in <lb/>
Miss Wintz's little book. She says: "The situation of this <lb/>
building is unique. A surging crowd ebbs and flows <reg orig="back-|wards">backwards</reg> <lb/>
and forwards all day and far into the night. Trams <lb/>
and omnibuses pass every minute, and the noise reminds <lb/>
one of a crowded London thoroughfare. The coffee-bar <lb/>
runs right round the basement, and is spacious and prettily <lb/>
decorated. Large blocks of cabins now tower behind, and <lb/>
a large hall seating a thousand people is in constant use."</p>
<p>The Portsmouth Sailors' Rest was opened by the Blue <lb/>
Jackets themselves on June 13th, 1882. It is impossible <lb/>
to count the number of Blue Jackets who come in and out <lb/>
all day long, though there is a "Sailors' Welcome" and a <lb/>
"Sailors' Home" in Portsea. The Sailors' Rest is often so <lb/>
<pb n="274" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0299"/>
crammed that not only cots and shake-downs are full, but <lb/>
the reading-room table, which is declared to have "ample <lb/>
accommodation for nine," and all the other tables, are full <lb/>
too. During the Jubilee year H.R.H. the Crown Princess <lb/>
of Germany, now the Empress Frederick, paid a visit to the <lb/>
Sailors' Rest, and offered to endow a cabin, as her second <lb/>
son, Prince Henry, was a sailor. His portrait now hangs <lb/>
in it. The sailor boys of H.M.S. <hi rend="italic">St. Vincent</hi> have a suite <lb/>
of rooms devoted to their use; these rooms are also utilised <lb/>
for ambulance and science classes, sailors' wives' meetings, <lb/>
drapery clubs, lending libraries, and naval benefit club. <lb/>
The Duke of York has not only endowed a cabin, but has <lb/>
become President of the Institution. "It is like Prince <lb/>
George; he's a Blue Jacket to the backbone," observed one <lb/>
of his admirers in the service.</p>
<p>On November 8th, 1890, H.M.S. <hi rend="italic">Serpent</hi> steamed out <lb/>
of Plymouth Sound. On the night of the 10th the <lb/>
magnificent ship struck on a reef, and sank. When that <lb/>
awful telegram reached Devonport: "Total loss of H.M.S. <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Serpent</hi>, with all on board," the scenes were harrowing. <lb/>
Crowds of women rushed to the Admiral's office, and <lb/>
the Admiral, H.R.H. the Duke of Edinburgh, did <lb/>
his best to help and comfort the poor creatures. He <lb/>
called a meeting, summoned the local branch of the Soldiers' <lb/>
and Sailors' Families Association, and also Miss Weston <lb/>
and her coadjutors.</p>
<p>"The Sailors' Rest became a beehive of work&mdash;widows, <lb/>
orphans, and broken-hearted mothers coming for help." <lb/>
Subscriptions flowed in amounting to &pound;13,000, wives <lb/>
and mothers were pensioned, and a sum of money at <lb/>
compound interest laid aside for each child on reaching <lb/>
majority. Since that sad time Miss Weston has started <lb/>
an "Employment Bureau" at Devonport, and also at <lb/>
Portsmouth.</p>
<p>When the Royal Naval Exhibition at Chelsea took place <lb/>
<pb n="275" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0300"/>
in 1891, the Committee gave Miss Weston permission to <lb/>
erect a model cabin in the Howe Gallery, and also asked <lb/>
her to put a small Sailors' Rest in the grounds for the use <lb/>
of the two hundred seamen and marines on duty. "This <lb/>
cabin, with its spotless bed, strip of carpet, and pictures, <lb/>
always had a crowd round it.</p>
<p>"There, mother," observed a man-o'-war's man one day, <lb/>
"that's where I sleep when I go to Miss Weston's, and I <lb/>
pay for it too."</p>
<p>"Get along, Bill," replied the bright-faced country-woman, <lb/>
"I don't believe thee; that bed and little room would cost <lb/>
five shillings at least. Why, lad, it's fit for an admiral!"</p>
<p>"Well, mother, Miss Weston thinks it's fit for me, and <lb/>
I gets it for sixpence."</p>
<p>From this little anecdote one can see the pride and delight <lb/>
the Blue Jackets take in their cosy cabins. The Prince <lb/>
and Princess of Wales stopped to admire it, and to <reg orig="con-|gratulate">congratulate</reg> <lb/>
Miss Weston on the success of the work. On <lb/>
a trophy over the Bungalow building is inscribed the words, <lb/>
"Miss Weston's Sailors' Rest. For the glory of God and <lb/>
the good of the service."</p>
<p>The terrible loss of H.M.S. <hi rend="italic">Victoria</hi> off the coast of Syria <lb/>
in 1893 is still fresh in our memories, when the ram of <lb/>
the <hi rend="italic">Camperdown</hi> cut her nearly in half. That scene of <lb/>
heroism and death was almost unique. We read: "There <lb/>
was no confusion, no panic; the doctors went to save the <lb/>
sick, the ship's police brought up the prisoners, and then <lb/>
the call sounded for the men to fall in on the port side of <lb/>
the deck. In serried lines they stood, looking pale and <lb/>
anxious, the ship meanwhile filling and heeling over. Not <lb/>
a man tried to save himself; all was obedience and order. <lb/>
Even when told to save themselves many laid down their <lb/>
lives for others."</p>
<p>The news was simply overwhelming, and the sorrow and <lb/>
distress awful to contemplate.</p>
<pb n="276" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0301"/>
<p>A large meeting was called by the Mayor in the <reg orig="Ports-|mouth">Portsmouth</reg> <lb/>
Town Hall, and Miss Weston pleaded for the widows <lb/>
and fatherless. She herself gave &pound;500 to the fund, and <lb/>
undertook the administration of the immediate relief. <lb/>
&pound;70,000 was raised, but months passed before this money <lb/>
could be administered. Miss Weston worked her Sailors' <lb/>
Rest as a food dep&ocirc;t and pay office. "We should all have <lb/>
starved but for you," was often said to her.</p>
<p>In the midst of this busy work she received a telegram <lb/>
from Admiral H.R.H. the Duke of Edinburgh, now the <lb/>
reigning Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha:</p>
<q><text id="d39"><body><div1 type="quotation">

<salute><hi rend="small-caps">Clarence House</hi>.</salute>

<p>"I feel sure that you and your workers will do all that is <lb/>
possible to alleviate the present distress.</p>
<closer>
<signed><hi rend="small-caps">Alfred</hi>."</signed>
</closer>
</div1></body></text></q>
<p>Princess May, too, who was then on the eve of her <lb/>
wedding, sent a touching message of sympathy in response <lb/>
to a telegram from Miss Weston, asking whether, in the <lb/>
midst of her joy, she could find time to send a message <lb/>
to these sorrowful ones.</p>
<p>It was at this time that, through the influence of the <lb/>
Duke of Edinburgh, Her Majesty, through the Secretary <lb/>
of State, conferred the title of "Royal" on the two Sailors' <lb/>
Rests at Devonport and Portsmouth.</p>
<p>Day by day and year by year Agnes Weston's work <lb/>
prospers and increases, and God's blessing seems to rest <lb/>
upon it. Her life is a happy and useful one, and her motto, <lb/>
"Doe y<hi rend="super">e</hi> nexte thinge," has opened up a mighty field <lb/>
of work before her. When her beneficent task is finished <lb/>
and the Master of the Vineyard calls his weary labourer <lb/>
home, may we not venture to hope that on her glad ears <lb/>
the welcome words may fall: "Well done, good and faith <lb/>
ful servant"!</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">It</hi> is a far cry from the gentle, large-minded <reg orig="philan-|thropist">philanthropist</reg>, <lb/>
Elizabeth Fry, or that ideal and queen of <lb/>
nurses, Florence Nightingale, to the lowly heroine of the <lb/>
Farne Islands; nevertheless, the name of Grace Darling <lb/>
will never sink into oblivion.</p>
<p>"Heroism," says Hare, "is the self-devotion of genius <lb/>
manifesting itself in action," and the very meaning of the <lb/>
word heroine endorses this, for its interpretation in our <lb/>
dictionary is, "a woman of brave spirit, the principal female <lb/>
person who figures in a remarkable action." And it is <lb/>
quite certain, even to the most callous and indifferent mind, <lb/>
that no braver action was ever performed by a woman than <lb/>
the rescue of the shipwrecked mariners by the humble <lb/>
daughter of a lighthouse keeper; and no name has been <lb/>
more tenderly enshrined in the hearts of thousands.</p>
<p>Grace Horsley Darling was born November 24th, 1815, <lb/>
at Bamborough, on the Northumberland coast. She was the <lb/>
seventh child of her parents. Her grandfather, Robert <lb/>
Darling, had settled as keeper of the coal-light on the <lb/>
<pb n="280" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0307"/>
Brownsman, the outermost of the Farne Islands. William <lb/>
Darling succeeded his father in that situation, but in 1826 <lb/>
he was transferred to the lighthouse on the Longstone, <lb/>
another of the same group of islands. At the time of <lb/>
their removal to Longstone, Grace was about eleven years <lb/>
old.</p>
<p>There is a description of these islands in a short memoir <lb/>
of Grace Darling by Elizabeth Starling that is worthy of <lb/>
being quoted in full. "The Farne Islands, twenty-five in <lb/>
number at low tide, though situated at no great distance <lb/>
from the Northumberland coast, are desolate in an <reg orig="un-|common">uncommon</reg> <lb/>
degree, and through the channels between the <lb/>
smaller Farne Islands the sea rushes with great force.&hellip;" <lb/>
Mr. Howitt, speaking of his visit to Longstone, says: "It <lb/>
was, like the rest of these desolate isles, all of dark <reg orig="whin-|stone">whinstone</reg>, <lb/>
cracked in every direction, and worn with the action <lb/>
of winds, waves and tempests, since the world began. <lb/>
Over the greater part of it was not a blade of grass nor a <lb/>
grain of earth; it was hard and iron-like stone, crusted <lb/>
round all the coast as far as high-water mark with limpet <lb/>
and still smaller shells. We ascended wrinkled hills of <lb/>
black stone, and descended into worn and dismal dells of <lb/>
the same, into some of which, where the tide got entrance, <lb/>
it came pouring and roaring in raging whiteness, and <lb/>
churning the loose fragments of whinstone into round <lb/>
pebbles, and piling them up in deep crevices, with seaweed, <lb/>
like great round ropes, and heaps of fucus. Over our <lb/>
heads screamed hundreds of hovering birds, the gull <lb/>
mingling its hideous laughter most wildly."</p>
<p>And speaking of the time when St. Cuthbert dwelt there, <lb/>
Baine, in his History of Durham, says: "Farne certainly <lb/>
afforded an excellent place for retirement and meditation. <lb/>
Here the prayer or repose of the hermit would be interrupted <lb/>
by the screaming of the waterfowl or the roaring of the <lb/>
wind or waves&mdash;not unfrequently, perhaps, would be heard <lb/>
<pb n="281" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0308"/>
the thrilling cry of distress from a ship breaking to pieces <lb/>
on the iron shore of the lonely island.</p>
<p>Such was the grim environment of Grace Darling's <lb/>
childhood&mdash;the scream of the sea fowl and thunder of the <lb/>
surf breaking on the shore had mingled with her cradle <lb/>
song. Among the desolate rocks the children had made <lb/>
their playground, with shells and seaweed for toys. William <lb/>
Darling was known as a steady, intelligent, trustworthy <lb/>
man, and peculiarly fitted for his onerous post. That of <lb/>
the Longstone lighthouse was a very dangerous one, and <lb/>
only men of tried endurance and strong sense of duty were <lb/>
appointed to it.</p>
<p>Few people realise the intense responsibility, as well as <lb/>
monotony, of the life of a lighthouse-keeper. The first rule <lb/>
given them is to light the lamps every evening at sunsetting, <lb/>
and keep them constantly burning bright and clear till <lb/>
sunrising. This entails long weary night watches, for he <lb/>
must not sleep or leave the room until his comrade relieves <lb/>
him; whatever happens, the light must burn brightly till <lb/>
morning.</p>
<p>In winter the life of a lighthouse-keeper and family <lb/>
is strangely isolated. For weeks at a time they see no <lb/>
visitors nor receive supplies; it is necessary for them <lb/>
to keep abundant stores of food; and, as lighthouses <lb/>
are now provided with libraries, they are not without <lb/>
amusement.</p>
<p>The Darling family seemed a very happy and united one. <lb/>
The children were all educated in a respectable manner. <lb/>
Some of the daughters went out in the world, or married; <lb/>
but Grace, who was remarkable for her retiring disposition, <lb/>
remained at Longstone with her parents, assisting her <lb/>
mother in household tasks. Now and then there were <lb/>
happy reunions, when the brothers and sisters came back <lb/>
to the rocky island home to spend a joyous Christmas. <lb/>
Then the lighthouse fires burnt cheerily, and the parents <lb/>
<pb n="282" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0309"/>
looked proudly at the bright young faces gathered round <lb/>
the hearth.</p>
<p>Grace Darling had reached her twenty-second year when <lb/>
the incident occurred which made her name famous. She <lb/>
is said to have been about middle size, of fair complexion, <lb/>
and very comely, gentle in aspect, and with an expression <lb/>
of great mildness and benevolence. William Howitt the <lb/>
poet, who visited her after she had become celebrated, <lb/>
found her the realisation of his idea of Jeanie Deans, the <lb/>
simple heroine in the "Heart of Mid Lothian." She had <lb/>
the sweetest smile, he said, "that he had ever seen in a <lb/>
person of her station and appearance. "You see," he <lb/>
says, "that she is a thoroughly good creature, and that <lb/>
under her modest exterior lies a spirit capable of the most <lb/>
exalted devotion, a devotion so entire, that daring is not so <lb/>
much a quality of her nature, as that the most perfect <lb/>
sympathy with suffering or endangered humanity swallows <lb/>
up and annihilates everything like fear or self-consideration, <lb/>
puts out, in fact, every sentiment but itself."</p>
<p>On September 5th, 1838, the <hi rend="italic">Forfarshire</hi> steamer, a <lb/>
vessel of three hundred tons burden, under the command <lb/>
of Mr. John Humble, sailed from Hull on her voyage to <lb/>
Dundee with a valuable cargo of bale goods and sheet iron.</p>
<p>There were about twenty-two cabin and nineteen steerage <lb/>
passengers, Captain Humble and his wife, ten seamen, <lb/>
four firemen, two engineers, two coal-trimmers, and two <lb/>
stewards&mdash;sixty-three persons. The ship was almost a new <lb/>
one, for she was only two years old, but her boilers were <lb/>
in bad repair. They had been examined at Hull, and <lb/>
a small leak had been detected and closed up. This <lb/>
occasioned a little anxiety in the minds of the passengers, <lb/>
and one of the steerage passengers, Mrs. Dawson, was <lb/>
heard to say, that if her husband came down to the vessel <lb/>
in time she should return with him.</p>
<p>The vessel sailed about half-past six in the evening, and <lb/>
<pb n="283" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0310"/>
passing through the Fairway between the Farne Islands <lb/>
and the land, entered Berwick Bay about eight. The wind <lb/>
blew strong from the north, and the leak increased so <lb/>
rapidly that the firemen could not keep the fires burning. <lb/>
About ten the <hi rend="italic">Forfarshire</hi> bore off St. Abb's Head, the storm <lb/>
still raging. We read, "the engines soon after became <lb/>
utterly useless, and the engine-man reported that they <lb/>
would not work. There being great danger of drifting <lb/>
ashore, the sails were hoisted fore and aft, and the vessel <lb/>
got about, in order to get her before the wind and keep <lb/>
her off the land. No attempt was made to anchor. The <lb/>
vessel soon became unmanageable, and the tide setting <lb/>
strong to the south she proceeded in that direction. It <lb/>
rained heavily during the whole time, and the fog was so <lb/>
dense that it became impossible to tell the situation of the <lb/>
vessel. At length breakers were discovered close to leeward, <lb/>
and the Farne Light, which about the same period became <lb/>
visible, left no doubt as to the imminent peril of all on <lb/>
board."</p>
<p>Between three and four the vessel struck with her bows <lb/>
foremost on the rocks, and some of the crew, intent on <lb/>
self-preservation, lowered the larboard-quarter boat down, <lb/>
and left the ship. An awful scene of panic ensued.</p>
<p>"Very soon after the first shock a powerful wave struck <lb/>
the vessel on the quarter, and raising her off the rocks, <lb/>
allowed her immediately after to fall violently down upon <lb/>
it, the sharp edge striking her about midships. She was <lb/>
by this fairly broken in two pieces, and the after-part, <lb/>
containing the cabin with many passengers, was instantly <lb/>
carried off through a tremendous current called the Piper <lb/>
Gut.&hellip; The captain and his wife were among those who <lb/>
perished."</p>
<p>There were only now nine unfortunate creatures left on <lb/>
the wreck&mdash;four passengers and five of the crew. Amongst <lb/>
the former was Mrs. Dawson, the steerage passenger, who <lb/>
<pb n="284" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0311"/>
had wished to leave the vessel. Her husband had not <lb/>
come in time. She was amongst the few who were in the <lb/>
forepart of the vessel. She had her two children with her, <lb/>
a boy and girl, aged eight and eleven. She held them <lb/>
firmly to the last; but when relief came the children lay <lb/>
stiffened corpses in her arms. It is impossible to describe <lb/>
their sufferings; they were half frozen by the cold, and <lb/>
heavy seas washed over them tearing off their clothing, <lb/>
while the hideous clamour of the wind and waves drowned <lb/>
their shrieks of agony. At the Longstone Lighthouse <lb/>
there was only William Darling and his wife and daughter. <lb/>
The dwellers in lighthouses are used to storms, but on the <lb/>
night of the 5th such a tremendous wind arose, and such <lb/>
a deluge of rain fell, that they felt unusual anxiety. If the <lb/>
account of this night be reliable, we are informed that <lb/>
Grace found it impossible to sleep. Towards morning she <lb/>
dozed, and then woke with a piercing cry for help in her <lb/>
ears. She roused her father at once, but though through <lb/>
the mist William Darling's glass showed him dim figures <lb/>
clinging to the wreck, he shrank from the idea of tempting <lb/>
the raging abyss of water. It was at Grace's solicitation <lb/>
that the boat was launched. The brave girl seized an oar <lb/>
and sprang into it, and her father soon followed.</p>
<p>"It is worthy of being noticed that Grace never had <lb/>
occasion to assist in the boat previous to the wreck of the <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Forfarshire</hi>, others of the family being at hand.</p>
<p>"In estimating the danger," the narrator continues, <lb/>
"which the heroic adventurers encountered, there is one <lb/>
circumstance which ought not to be forgotten. Had it not <lb/>
been ebb tide, the boat could not have passed between the <lb/>
islands; and Darling and his daughter knew that the tide <lb/>
would be flowing on their return, when their united strength <lb/>
would have been utterly insufficient to pull the boat back <lb/>
to the lighthouse island; so that, had they not got the <lb/>
assistance of the survivors in rowing back again, they <lb/>
<pb n="285" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0312"/>
themselves would have been compelled to remain on the <lb/>
rock beside the wreck until the tide ebbed again."</p>
<p>Contemporary evidence is always valuable; and in the <lb/>
accounts that have reached us of Grace Darling's heroic <lb/>
act, there is nothing exaggerated or overstrained&mdash;it was, <lb/>
as we have already quoted, only "the self-devotion of <lb/>
genius manifesting itself in action."</p>
<p>It does not need a vivid imagination to picture that <lb/>
scene: the frail boat toiling over the billows, the slight <lb/>
girl bending over her oar, passionate pity and compassion <lb/>
for the poor sufferers nerving her weak arm with superhuman <lb/>
strength. Who knows what silent prayers went up to <lb/>
Heaven as she looked fearfully across the stormy waters, <lb/>
while the startled seabirds shrieked above her head, and <lb/>
and the salt spray dashed in her face? "It could only <lb/>
have been by the exertion of muscular power, as well as <lb/>
determined courage, that the father and daughter carried <lb/>
the boat up to the rock," we are informed, in the same <lb/>
trustworthy account of the rescue; "and when there, a <lb/>
danger, greater even than that which they had encountered <lb/>
in approaching it, arose from the difficulty of steadying the <lb/>
boat, and preventing its being destroyed on those sharp ridges <lb/>
by the ever-restless chafing and heaving of the billows."</p>
<p>By this time the unfortunate sufferers were nearly prostrate. <lb/>
Mrs. Dawson, with a mother's undying devotion, still held <lb/>
her dead children in her arms; the poor little creatures had <lb/>
been so buffeted and battered against the cruel rocks that <lb/>
they had not long survived.</p>
<p>A fireman named Donovan had lain on the rock for three <lb/>
hours in cruel suffering, lashed and beaten by the waves as <lb/>
they washed over him. But he had held firmly on to a <lb/>
strong spike nail; and though his hands were bleeding he <lb/>
would not let go.</p>
<p>The difficult task was accomplished, and great was the <lb/>
amazement of the survivors of the wreck when the boat <lb/>
<pb n="286" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0313"/>
approached the rock, and they saw one of their deliverers <lb/>
was a girl; tears streamed down the sailors' weatherbeaten <lb/>
faces as they watched her straining efforts. "God bless <lb/>
her!" was probably the cry of their heart, "she must be one <lb/>
of God's angels, and not a mere woman." One by one the <lb/>
poor creatures were safely placed in the coble, but the return <lb/>
was even more perilous than the outward journey; but <lb/>
Longstone was reached at last, and the sufferers were housed <lb/>
in the hospitable lighthouse. Here, owing to the raging <lb/>
seas, they were obliged to remain from Friday morning <lb/>
until Sunday. Grace gave up her bed to poor Mrs. Dawson, <lb/>
whose mental and bodily sufferings were intense, and <reg orig="con-|tented">contented</reg> <lb/>
herself with lying on a table; and the boat's crew <lb/>
that came off to their relief from Sunderland, and who were <lb/>
also detained by stress of weather, slept on the floor round <lb/>
the fire.</p>
<p>Grace Darling's heroic deed was soon noised abroad, and <lb/>
the Longstone lighthouse became the centre of attraction to <lb/>
thousands. Many people visited the wreck, which consisted <lb/>
of the forecastle, part of the engine, paddle-wheels, anchor, <lb/>
cable, foremast, and rigging. Search was made for the <lb/>
missing bodies, but with little success; and the cargo, which <lb/>
was extremely valuable, could not be recovered. A public <lb/>
subscription was soon set on foot, and Grace was presented <lb/>
with the splendid gift of &pound;700. The Royal Humane <lb/>
Society also forwarded a vote of thanks to her, and the <lb/>
President presented her with a silver teapot, and money <lb/>
flowed in from other sources. At Newcastle the amount of <lb/>
&pound;280 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was subscribed. Grace received &pound;160, and <lb/>
her father &pound;58, and &pound;35 was presented to the North <lb/>
Sunderland boatmen. A most gratifying note was received <lb/>
by the editor of the <hi rend="italic">Sun</hi> from the hero of Navarino.</p>

<p>"The Royal National Institution for the Preservation of <lb/>
Life from Shipwreck" voted the silver medal to William <lb/>
Darling and his daughter, and subscribed &pound;10 to the <lb/>
Darling fund. The directors of the "Glasgow Humane <lb/>
Society" also sent their honorary medal to Grace. It bore <lb/>
the following inscription:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Presented by the Glasgow Humane Society to Miss <lb/>
Grace Horsley Darling, in admiration of her dauntless and <lb/>
heroic conduct in saving &lpar;along with her father&rpar; the lives of <lb/>
nine persons from the wreck of the <hi rend="italic">Forfarshire</hi> steamer, <lb/>
7th September, 1838."</p>
<p>The Duke of Northumberland also took a great interest <lb/>
in Grace Darling; he not only gave a handsome subscription <lb/>
to the testimonial, but took care of the money collected, <lb/>
and advised her how to invest it.</p>
<p>Of course Grace's portrait was taken, and sold with <lb/>
astonishing rapidity; indeed, the simple heroine excited <lb/>
such a furore, that actually the manager of a theatre <reg orig="con-|ceived">conceived</reg> <lb/>
the idea of having the occurrence represented on <lb/>
the stage, and offered her &pound;800 for merely sitting in a <lb/>
boat that every one might see her. But Grace Darling's <lb/>
self-respect would not allow her to become a spectacle for <lb/>
curious eyes.</p>
<p>"She was glad to have saved lives at the risk of her <lb/>
own," she affirmed, "and would most willingly do it again <lb/>
if opportunity should occur; but she could not feel that she <lb/>
had done anything great, and certainly she did not wish <lb/>
<pb n="288" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0315"/>
for the praise that had been bestowed on her. As for <lb/>
going to the theatre to receive the plaudits of a curious <lb/>
crowd, that was the last thing she desired."</p>
<p>As the days passed on Grace became still more famous. <lb/>
The Duchess of Northumberland sent for her to Alnwick <lb/>
Castle, and though she did not see the Queen, Her Majesty <lb/>
was well acquainted with the deed.</p>
<p>Hero worship is sometimes ludicrous as well as <reg orig="in-|convenient">inconvenient</reg>, <lb/>
as an amusing extract from a paper informs us. <lb/>
"Grace Darling's name is now as well known throughout <lb/>
the island as Queen Anne's; and to tell the people of the <lb/>
decease of the one is about as necessary as to warn them <lb/>
of the living glory of the other.&hellip; All feel individual <lb/>
gratitude to Grace Darling, and not a stranger that talks of <lb/>
her but knows her intimately. But, as we have said, the <lb/>
expression of this feeling of love and reverence is assuming an <lb/>
awkward character. It has taken, it appears, the shape, or <lb/>
shapes, of infinite demands upon her generosity in a minor <lb/>
way&hellip; just one ringlet, one apiece for upwards of ten <lb/>
thousand applicants scattered over various parts of the <lb/>
kingdom, but all linked together by a common sentiment. <lb/>
The last report is &lpar;we quote the newspapers&rpar; that Grace is <lb/>
nearly bald; that lock after lock has gone, each finding its <lb/>
way into ring, brooch, or locket, until 'The Darling of <lb/>
life's crew' discovers, like C&aelig;sar, that a laurel crown may <lb/>
be worn for use as well as ornament, may hide as well as <lb/>
adorn."</p>
<p>William Howitt gives an interesting account of his visit <lb/>
to Longstone and his interview with Grace Darling.</p>
<p>"When I went she was not visible, and I was afraid I <lb/>
should not see her, as her father said she very much disliked <lb/>
meeting strangers that she thought came to stare at her; <lb/>
but when the old man and I had had a little conversation <lb/>
he went up to her room, and soon came down with a <lb/>
smile, saying she would be with us soon. So when we had <lb/>
<pb n="289" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0316"/>
been up to the top lighthouse and had seen its machinery, <lb/>
had taken a good look-out at the distant shore, and Darling <lb/>
had pointed out the spot of the wreck, and the way they <lb/>
took to bring the people off, we went down and found Grace <lb/>
sitting at her sewing, very neatly but very simply dressed in <lb/>
a plain sort of striped print gown, with her watch-seal just <lb/>
seen at her side, and her hair neatly braided&mdash;just, in fact, <lb/>
as such girls are dressed, only not quite so smart as they <lb/>
often are. She rose very modestly, and with a pleasant <lb/>
smile said, 'How do you do, sir?' Her figure is by no <lb/>
means striking&mdash;quite the contrary; but her face is full of <lb/>
sense, modesty and genuine goodness; and that is just the <lb/>
character she bears. Her prudence delights one. We are <lb/>
charmed that she should so well have supported the <reg orig="bril-|liancy">brilliancy</reg> <lb/>
of her humane deed. It is confirmative of the <lb/>
notion that such actions must spring from genuine heart <lb/>
and mind."</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Sunderland Herald</hi> of November 22nd also <reg orig="con-|tained">contained</reg> <lb/>
a very pleasant article on the Darlings. After <lb/>
describing Grace much as William Howitt had done, it <lb/>
went on: "There is excellent accommodation to be met <lb/>
with at Longstone lighthouse, although it stands alone, upon <lb/>
a barren rock, five miles from the mainland. The tower is <lb/>
very ingeniously constructed, and contains a well-furnished <lb/>
sitting-room, in which is a capital collection of popular <lb/>
works, and three or four comfortable bedrooms. These, <lb/>
with an abundance of good, wholesome, homely fare, <lb/>
together with the very cheerful service of Grace and her <lb/>
parents, render a visit to the Farne Islands a treat of no <lb/>
ordinary description. Grace was taught to read and write <lb/>
by her father, together with seven of her brothers and <lb/>
sisters, and their schoolroom was the lantern of the <reg orig="light-|house">lighthouse</reg>. <lb/>
William Darling, the father of Grace, is only in his <lb/>
fifty-fourth year, though he looks much older. His face <lb/>
reminds me of the late Thomas Stothard, R.A., the <lb/>
<pb n="290" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0317"/>
painter of 'The Canterbury Pilgrimage,' and his person <lb/>
of the venerable Earl Grey. He reads much, and is most <lb/>
passionately fond of natural history.</p>
<p>"Mrs. Darling is a hale, comely old lady, bordering on <lb/>
threescore, and may be found engaged three-parts of the <lb/>
day at her spinning-wheel. It is true she assisted to make <lb/>
ready the boat at daybreak on the morning of the melancholy <lb/>
wreck of the <hi rend="italic">Forfarshire</hi>; but her heart failed her when her <lb/>
husband and child pushed off, and as the waves receded <lb/>
from the rock on which she stood trembling with tears, she <lb/>
exclaimed, "Oh, Grace, if your father is lost, I'll blame <lb/>
a' you for this morning's work."</p>
<p>It is interesting to know that the boat which carried <lb/>
Grace Darling and her father that eventful day is probably <lb/>
still in existence. It was, we believe, exhibited at the <lb/>
Exhibition of 1862, and again at the Naval and Fisheries <lb/>
Exhibition. It came into possession of her brother, Mr. <lb/>
George Darling, who afterwards sold it to Major Joicy, <lb/>
of Stocksfield-on-Tyne. Some planks taken out of it for <lb/>
repairs have been preserved as great treasures, and <reg orig="snuff-|boxes">snuffboxes</reg> <lb/>
and other articles made from them.</p>
<p>It is painful to reflect that this beloved heroine was destined <lb/>
to an early death, for she was only six-and-twenty when <reg orig="con-|sumption">consumption</reg> <lb/>
carried her off. Grace had never been particularly <lb/>
robust; she was slight of frame, and had not a strong build. <lb/>
Her health appearing delicate towards the end of 1841, she <lb/>
was by medical advice removed from Longstone lighthouse <lb/>
to Bamborough, and placed under the care of a doctor, <lb/>
Mr. Fender. Finding herself no better, Grace begged to be <lb/>
removed to Wooler for change of air. "Wooler is a small <lb/>
market town in Northumberland, eighteen miles north-west <lb/>
of Alnwick, and is situated on the borders of the county. <lb/>
The scenery is delightful, for it is in the midst of a country <lb/>
varied with sunny hills and picturesque glens, which belong <lb/>
principally to the Cheviot range, the Humbleton, Hedgehope, <lb/>
<pb n="291" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0318"/>
and Beamish-head hills." But the pure, bracing atmosphere <lb/>
gave the invalid no relief, and it was evident that she was <lb/>
slowly fading.</p>
<p>At the request of her father she met him at Alnwick <lb/>
with a view of accompanying him to Newcastle for further <lb/>
medical advice. The Duchess of Northumberland, hearing <lb/>
of her arrival at Alnwick, procured for her a comfortable <lb/>
lodging in an airy part of the town, and sent her own <lb/>
physician. But all care and skill failed to arrest the fatal <lb/>
disease. Her father grew anxious that she should be <lb/>
with her own people; she was therefore removed to <lb/>
her sister's house at Bamborough, where she arrived <lb/>
only ten days before her death. On the day Grace left <lb/>
Alnwick, the Duchess, with a single attendant, went to <lb/>
the lodging for the purpose of bidding her farewell, which <lb/>
she did with the most unaffected kindness. Grace bore <lb/>
her suffering with patience and resignation. Her eldest <lb/>
sister, Thomasin, nursed her devotedly; but though human <lb/>
love could soothe her last moments, it could not prolong <lb/>
her life.</p>
<p>Throughout her trying illness she was never heard to <lb/>
murmur or utter a complaint. "Shortly before her <lb/>
death," we are informed, "she expressed a wish to see <lb/>
as many of her relations as the peculiar nature of their <lb/>
employments would admit, and, with surprising fortitude <lb/>
and self-command, she delivered to each one of them <lb/>
some token of remembrance. This done, she calmly awaited <lb/>
the approach of death; and finally, on October 20th, 1842, <lb/>
resigned her spirit without a murmur." The funeral <lb/>
took place at Bamborough, and was very numerously <lb/>
attended.</p>
<p>Two worthy memorials of Grace Darling have been erected <lb/>
&mdash;one in Bamborough churchyard, and the other in St. <lb/>
Cuthbert's Chapel, on the Farne Island. The former <reg orig="con-|tains">contains</reg> <lb/>
a recumbent figure of Grace Darling, and the other, <lb/>
<pb n="292" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0319"/>
which was put up on September 9th, 1844, bears this <lb/>
inscription:&mdash; <lb/>
<q><hi rend="small-caps">To The Memory Of</hi> <lb/>
GRACE HORSLEY DARLING, <lb/>
<hi rend="small-caps">A Native Of Bamborough, And An Inhabitant Of These <lb/>

Who Died October</hi> 20<hi rend="small-caps">th</hi>, 1842, <lb/>
<hi rend="small-caps">Aged</hi> 26 <hi rend="small-caps">Years</hi>.</q></p>
<p>But her best memorial is in the countless hearts that still <lb/>
love and cherish her, and to whom the name of Grace <lb/>
Darling, the noble heroine of the Farne Islands, is and <lb/>
always will be a sweet and sacred memory of a woman's pity <lb/>
and a woman's heroism.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Many</hi>, many years ago, in the old days that sometimes <lb/>
seem so near and at others so far away, the writer <lb/>
of this sketch remembers standing in the vestibule <lb/>
of Buckingham Palace, waiting with thrills of suppressed <lb/>
excitement to see the Queen come down from her private <lb/>
apartments. Her Majesty was to open or prorogue <reg orig="Parlia-|ment">Parliament</reg> <lb/>
that day; at this distance of time that matter is involved <lb/>
in haze, but she remembers the court was in mourning for <lb/>
some royal personage.</p>
<p>Down the grand staircase came the little procession; the <lb/>
Queen, small of stature but of regal dignity, leaning on the <lb/>
arm of her stalwart, handsome husband, the goodly Prince <lb/>
Consort, and behind them a slim girlish figure in white.</p>
<p>There was a moment's delay at the door while the Queen <lb/>
took her train from the pages before stepping into the <lb/>
carriage; and even to this day, through the mists of these long <lb/>
years, the writer has a vivid memory of the young Princess, <lb/>
so bright and animated and full of life, the pale expressive <lb/>
face looking small and girlish under its wreath of roses. That <lb/>
bright, happy-looking young girl was the Princess Alice, <lb/>
<pb n="296" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0325"/>
whose name is still so beloved and honoured, and whose <lb/>
beautiful life was closed by so early and tragic a death.</p>
<p>Princess Alice was born at Buckingham Palace on April <lb/>
25th, 1843. She was the third child and the second daughter <lb/>
of our gracious Sovereign. "Our little baby is to be called <lb/>
Alice," she wrote to King Leopold&mdash;"an old English name, <lb/>
and the other names are to be Maud &lpar;another old English <lb/>
name, and the same as Matilda&rpar;, and Mary, as she was <lb/>
born on Aunt Gloucester's birthday. The sponsors are to <lb/>
be, the King of Hanover, Ernestus Primus &lpar;now Duke <lb/>
of Coburg&rpar;, poor Princess Sophia Matilda, and Feodore <lb/>
&lpar;Princess of Hohenlohe-Langenburg&rpar;, and the christening <lb/>
to be on the 2nd of June." The King of Hanover, <reg orig="how-|ever">however</reg>, <lb/>
arrived too late to be present at the ceremony; but the <lb/>
happy mother wrote in her cheery way, "that it went off <lb/>
very brilliantly. Nothing could be more <foreign lang="ger"><hi rend="italic">anst&auml;ndig</hi></foreign>, and little <lb/>
Alice behaved extremely well."</p>
<p>The childhood of Princess Alice, like all the other Royal <lb/>
children's, was a happy one. "I ever look back to my <lb/>
childhood and girlhood as the happiest time of my life," <lb/>
she wrote herself in 1869. By her parents she was <reg orig="con-|sidered">considered</reg> <lb/>
the beauty of the family; and according to the <lb/>
Queen "she was a very vain little person." On her fourth <lb/>
birthday Lady Lyttelton wrote a charming description of <lb/>
the little Princess. "Dear Princess Alice is too pretty, <lb/>
in her low frock and pearl necklace, tripping about and <lb/>
blushing and smiling at her honours. The whole family <lb/>
indeed appear to advantage on birthdays; no tradesman or <lb/>
country squire can keep one with such hearty, simple <lb/>
affection and enjoyment. One present, I think, we shall <lb/>
all wish to live farther off&mdash;a live lamb, all over pink ribbons <lb/>
and bells. He is already the greatest pet as one may <lb/>
suppose." And again: "Princess Alice's lamb is the <lb/>
cause of many tears. He will not take to his mistress, <lb/>
but runs away lustily, and will soon butt at her, though <lb/>
<pb n="297" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0326"/>
she is most coaxy, and said to him in her sweetest tones, <lb/>
after kissing his nose often, 'Milly, dear Milly! do you <lb/>
like me?'"</p>
<p>Simplicity and careful discipline were maintained in <lb/>
the royal nurseries and schoolroom. The latter at <lb/>
Windsor Castle, "was a large delightful room with views <lb/>
over the South Terrace, the stables and the Home <lb/>
Park, and is now used by Princess Beatrice. We are <lb/>
told that, in spite of its luxurious furniture," on the <lb/>
walls still hang the numberless sketches and paintings <lb/>
executed by the Princesses of scenes in Scotland, pet <lb/>
animals and birds, and various essays at family portraits. <lb/>
The Queen encouraged her children to speak foreign <lb/>
languages by making them act little theatrical pieces; <lb/>
tableaux also were got up in the royal nursery, and in <lb/>
1854 the Queen gave them for their own use the lovely <lb/>
Swiss cottage and gardens in the grounds of Osborne, where <lb/>
the boys could practise carpentering and gardening, and <lb/>
the girls cookery and housekeeping. The Queen would <lb/>
often be entertained there by the children.</p>
<p>From some memoranda contributed by the then Crown <lb/>
Princess to the Memoir of the Princess Alice, we read, <lb/>
that "fresh, blooming and healthy, escaping most of the <lb/>
illnesses of childhood, cheerful, merry, full of fun and <lb/>
mischief, she &lpar;Princess Alice&rpar; delighted in all bodily <lb/>
exercises, such as gymnastics, skating, etc. Above all she <lb/>
was passionately fond of riding and of horses. She <reg orig="pre-|ferred">preferred</reg> <lb/>
playing with her brothers, and was bold and fearless <lb/>
as a boy. With all this she soon showed proofs of real <lb/>
kindness of heart and tender consideration for others."</p>
<p>In 1849 she and the three eldest children accompanied <lb/>
their parents to Ireland, and in 1850 to the Highlands. All <lb/>
her life Princess Alice was an enthusiastic lover of Highland <lb/>
scenery.</p>
<p>The young Princess formed a warm friendship in her <lb/>
<pb n="298" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0327"/>
girlhood with the Princess Louise of Prussia, now Grand <lb/>
Duchess of Baden, who records her impression of her.</p>
<p>"She was at that time most graceful in appearance, <lb/>
charming, merry, and amiable; and though always <reg orig="occupy-|ing">occupying</reg> <lb/>
a subordinate place to her very gifted and distinguished <lb/>
sister, there never was the least semblance of disagreement. <lb/>
Alice's cheerful disposition and her great power of <reg orig="observa-|tion">observation</reg> <lb/>
showed itself very early in the pleasantest manner, and <lb/>
she had a remarkable gift of making herself attractive to <lb/>
others.&hellip; Our walks and drives together, the life in the <lb/>
schoolroom, the games in the corridors or in dear old <lb/>
Baron Stockmar's room,&mdash;these and all the pleasure and <lb/>
enjoyment of being together with the two sisters, will ever <lb/>
remain amongst the happiest and most lasting of my <lb/>
recollections."</p>
<p>And later on she writes: "A great vein of humour <lb/>
showed itself in her &lpar;Princess Alice&rpar;, as well as a certain <lb/>
sharpness in criticising people who were not congenial to <lb/>
her. Many a little conflict took place in the schoolroom; <lb/>
but while the individuality of the sisters became more and <lb/>
more distinct, their happy relations to one another became <lb/>
unchanged."</p>
<p>The life in the Highlands was full of delight to the <lb/>
Royal children. They were encouraged to visit the humblest <lb/>
cottages; their visits also to their grandmother the Duchess <lb/>
of Kent at Frogmore and Abergeldie were much enjoyed.</p>
<p>Princess Alice's first visit abroad was to Cherbourg; <lb/>
when she accompanied her parents.</p>
<p>The marriage of the Princess Royal the following year <lb/>
made a great change in the life of the Princess Alice. She <lb/>
was now the eldest daughter, and had new responsibilities <lb/>
and duties; her intercourse with her father became closer, <lb/>
and from him she gained her love of art and music.</p>
<p>On April 21st, 1859, her confirmation took place. She had <lb/>
been carefully prepared for it by the Dean of Windsor &lpar;the <lb/>
<pb n="299" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0328"/>
Hon. and Very Rev. G. Wellesley&rpar;; the Prince Consort had <lb/>
also given her instruction. "She was in a most devotional <lb/>
state of mind," the Queen wrote to King Leopold; <lb/>
"quiet, gentle, self-possessed, and deeply impressed by the <lb/>
importance and solemnity of the event. She answered <lb/>
admirably at her examination, and went through the <lb/>
ceremony in a very perfect manner." The Queen had <lb/>
before this given her opinion in the following words: <lb/>
"She is very good, gentle, sensible, and amiable, and a <lb/>
real comfort to me. I shall not let her marry as long as I <lb/>
can reasonably delay her doing so." But in spite of the <lb/>
Queen's avowed determination, it was not long before <lb/>
Prince Louis of Hesse paid an eventful visit to England. <lb/>
In the following year, 1860, he and his brother, Prince <lb/>
Henry, were guests at Windsor Castle. After their departure <lb/>
the Prince Consort wrote to Baron Stockmar that Prince <lb/>
Louis and Princess Alice had formed a mutual liking. This <lb/>
was in June, and in November Prince Louis paid a second <lb/>
visit. The Queen wrote of the betrothal in her Journal as <lb/>
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>"&hellip; After dinner, whilst talking to the gentlemen, <lb/>
I perceived Alice and Louis talking before the fireplace <lb/>
more earnestly than usual, and when I passed to go to the <lb/>
other room, both came up to me, and Alice, in much <lb/>
agitation, said he had proposed to her, and he begged my <lb/>
blessing. I could only squeeze his hand and say 'Certainly,' <lb/>
and that we would see him in our room later. Got through <lb/>
the evening, working as well as we could. Alice came to <lb/>
our room &hellip; agitated but quiet. Albert sent for Louis <lb/>
to his room; he went first to him; and then called Alice <lb/>
and me in.&hellip; Louis has a warm, noble heart. We <lb/>
embraced our dear Alice, and praised her much to him. <lb/>
He pressed and kissed my hand, and I embraced him. After <lb/>
talking a little, we parted. A most touching, and to me a <lb/>
sacred moment."</p>
<pb n="300" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0329"/>
<p>The betrothed couple were very happy. The young <lb/>
prince was at that time three-and-twenty, and very manly <lb/>
and attractive. When her <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italic">fianc&eacute;</hi></foreign> left England Princess <lb/>
Alice spent the greater part of her evenings with the <lb/>
Duchess of Kent, either reading or playing on the piano <lb/>
to her. The Duchess' health was breaking, and on March <lb/>
16th of the following year she passed away, in the presence <lb/>
of the Queen, Prince Consort, and Princess Alice.</p>
<p>The Princess Royal set out from Berlin to be with her <lb/>
mother in her sorrow, and both she and the Princess Alice <lb/>
were sources of great comfort to the afflicted Queen.</p>
<p>On April 13th the contemplated marriage of Princess <lb/>
Alice with Prince Louis of Hesse Darmstadt, was announced <lb/>
by the Queen to the Privy Council, and communicated by <lb/>
message to Parliament. A dowry of &pound;30,000 and an <lb/>
annuity of &pound;6,000 was voted without a dissentient voice. <lb/>
"She will not," writes the Prince Consort, "be able to do <lb/>
great things with it."</p>
<p>In May Prince Louis arrived at Osborne for a visit, <lb/>
and fell ill with the measles. Prince Leopold caught them <lb/>
from him and was seriously ill. Prince Louis also paid <lb/>
another visit in September, and joined them at Balmoral.</p>
<p>In the midst of all the festive preparations for Princess <lb/>
Alice's marriage the following year, a terrible event was to <lb/>
overshadow the royal household. The Prince Consort fell <lb/>
ill, low fever set in, and, worn out by overwork and anxiety, <lb/>
though still in the prime of life, the beloved husband and <lb/>
father passed peacefully away on December 14th, 1861.</p>
<p>It was during these days of mourning that Princess Alice <lb/>
showed her strength of mind and her devotion to her <lb/>
broken-hearted mother. A passage must be quoted here <lb/>
from the testimony of an eye-witness. "Herself filled with <lb/>
intensest sorrow at her beloved father's death&mdash;and what a <lb/>
father! what a head of a family! what a friend and adviser <lb/>
to his wife and children &mdash;she at once took into her own <lb/>
<pb n="301" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0330"/>
hands everything that was necessary in those first dark days <lb/>
of the destruction of that happy home. All communications <lb/>
from the ministers and household passed through the <lb/>
Princess's hands to the Queen, then bowed down with grief. <lb/>
She endeavoured in every way possible, either verbally or <lb/>
by letter, to save her mother all trouble. The decision to <lb/>
leave Windsor for Osborne directly after the Prince's death, <lb/>
according to the urgent wish of the King of the Belgians, <lb/>
and which it was so difficult and painful for the Queen to <lb/>
make, was obtained by the Princess's influence." And in a <lb/>
memorandum by the Grand-Duchess of Baden: "It was <lb/>
the very intimate intercourse with the sorrowing Queen <lb/>
at that time which called forth in Princess Alice that <lb/>
keen interest and understanding in politics for which she <lb/>
was afterwards so distinguished.&hellip; The Princess suddenly <lb/>
developed into a wise, far-seeing woman, living only for <lb/>
others, and beloved and respected by the highest as well as <lb/>
by the lowest."</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> always spoke with warm admiration of the <lb/>
young Princesss' devotion and unselfishness in those trying <lb/>
days. "It is impossible to speak too highly of the <lb/>
strength of mind and self-sacrifice shown by Princess Alice <lb/>
during those dreadful days."</p>
<p>The preparations for her marriage still continued, <reg orig="accord-|ing">according</reg> <lb/>
to the known intentions and wishes of the Prince <lb/>
Consort. It was solemnised quietly at Osborne on July 1st, <lb/>
1862. The Archbishop of York performed the ceremony <lb/>
in the absence of the Archbishop of Canterbury, who was <lb/>
ill. It was a sad wedding. The Duke of Saxe Coburg led <lb/>
the bride to the altar, the Queen sitting behind in deep <lb/>
mourning.</p>
<p>The newly married pair spent three days at St. Clare, <lb/>
near Ryde, and on July 9th they left England. It must <lb/>
have been a sore trial to the devoted daughter to leave her <lb/>
widowed mother and her beloved country; but hers was a <lb/>
<pb n="302" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0331"/>
marriage of true and dear affection, and, in spite of sad <lb/>
drawbacks, the newly wedded pair were very happy.</p>
<p>The Grand-Ducal Family of Hesse were also in trouble. <lb/>
Some weeks before Princess Alice's marriage the <reg orig="Grand-|Duchess">Grand-Duchess</reg> <lb/>
had died; nevertheless, preparations for a brilliant <lb/>
reception were being made. The young couple stayed at <lb/>
Brussels a short time, and on the 12th made their state <lb/>
entry into Darmstadt. The Princess made a great impression <lb/>
by her sweet looks, grace, and dignity. Her new home was <lb/>
an unpretending house in a quiet quarter of the town, near <lb/>
the palace of Prince and Princess Charles of Hesse. Her <lb/>
household was on a very simple scale. In a letter to the <lb/>
Queen she writes: "We then went to our rooms, which <lb/>
are very small, but so prettily arranged, with such perfect <lb/>
taste, all by my own dear Louis; they look quite English."</p>
<p>Her reception seemed to have touched the Princess's <lb/>
heart, for in another letter she says: "I am really deeply <lb/>
touched by the kindness and enthusiasm shown by the <lb/>
people, which is said to be quite unusual. They wait near <lb/>
the house to see us, and cheer constantly, even the soldiers. <lb/>
&hellip; The whole family are very amiable towards me, and <lb/>
Prince Alexander is most clever and amusing."</p>
<p>Some of the young wife's letters strike a deeper keynote <lb/>
of intense happiness mingled with filial sympathy for her <lb/>
bereaved mother. "If I could relinquish part of my present <lb/>
happiness to restore you some of yours," she writes, in the <lb/>
fulness of her yearning love, "with a full heart would I do <lb/>
it; but God's will be done! God sustain my precious <lb/>
mother! is the hourly prayer of her loving and sympathising <lb/>
child." And in another place: "You tell me to speak to <lb/>
you of my happiness&mdash;our happiness. You will understand <lb/>
the feeling which made me silent towards you, my own <lb/>
dear bereaved mother, on that point.&hellip; If I say I love <lb/>
my dear husband, that is scarcely enough; it is a love <lb/>
and esteem which increases daily, hourly; which he also <lb/>
<pb n="303" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0332"/>
shows to me by such consideration, such tender, loving <lb/>
ways. What was life before, to what it has become now! <lb/>
There is such blessed peace in being by his side, being his <lb/>
wife; there is such a feeling of security; and we two have <lb/>
a world of our own when we are together, which nothing <lb/>
can touch or intrude upon."</p>
<p>The summer passed happily. The Prince and Princess <lb/>
paid a short visit to Coburg, and a longer one to Auerbach, <lb/>
from whence they made excursions to Heidelberg and <lb/>
Carlsruhe. In September they went to Rheinhardtsbrunn, <lb/>
in Thuringen, to meet the Queen, and it was then arranged <lb/>
they were to spend the winter and spring in England with <lb/>
Her Majesty.</p>
<p>The house in Darmstadt was so small that plans had to <lb/>
be made for a new palace. It was a great comfort to the <lb/>
Princess to be with her mother on the first anniversary <lb/>
of her father's death.</p>
<p>On the last day of the old year Princess Alice met with <lb/>
a carriage accident, which happily was followed by no bad <lb/>
results.</p>
<p>The next event in her life was the marriage of her brother, <lb/>
the Prince of Wales, to the Princess Alexandra of Denmark, <lb/>
on March 10th following, and on April 5th the Princess <lb/>
Alice gave birth to a daughter at Windsor Castle.</p>
<p>The little Princess was christened on the 27th by the <lb/>
Hessian Court Chaplain Bender, and received the names of <lb/>
Victoria Alberta Elizabeth Matilda. After a short stay in <lb/>
London, Prince and Princess Louis of Hesse, with their <lb/>
infant daughter, returned to Darmstadt. They spent the <lb/>
summer months at Kranichstein, a shooting lodge near <lb/>
Darmstadt, belonging to the Grand-Duke. She writes to <lb/>
her mother about her little daughter: "Our little one is <lb/>
grown so pretty. She has little pink cheeks, and is so fat <lb/>
and good-humoured. I often think her like you when she <lb/>
smiles."</p>
<pb n="304" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0333"/>
<p>The Congress of German potentates and princes at <lb/>
Frankfort in August brought the Princess into contact with <lb/>
many crowned heads.</p>
<p>Later the Princess met the Queen at Coburg, and <reg orig="after-|wards">afterwards</reg> <lb/>
received Her Majesty and her sisters Helena, Louise, <lb/>
and Beatrice, with her brother Alfred, on a short visit at <lb/>
Kranichstein. A few weeks later the Prince and Princess, <lb/>
with their child, joined the Queen at Balmoral. When <lb/>
they returned to Darmstadt in November they found the <lb/>
new palace had made progress and was roofed in. The <lb/>
Grand-Duke had given the site, and the plans were from <lb/>
the Princess's designs.</p>
<p>In December Prince Louis' only sister Anna was engaged <lb/>
to be married to the Grand-Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, <lb/>
and the Princess spent her first Christmas in Germany in <lb/>
this year, 1863. She gives a simple little description of <lb/>
her preparations: "A great pleasure I have had in arranging <lb/>
a tree for our good servants. I bought all the things myself <lb/>
at the market, and hung them on the tree; then I also got <lb/>
things for darling Louis." In another letter: "Baby had a <lb/>
little tree early at her grandpapa's and grandmamma's, with <lb/>
all her pretty things.</p>
<p>1864 was an eventful year for Germany. After a severe <lb/>
struggle the Duchies of Schleswig-Holstein were wrested <lb/>
from the control of the German Confederation at Frankfort, <lb/>
and occupied by Austrian and Prussian troops. The <lb/>
marriage of the Princess Anna on May 12th was a cause <lb/>
of great rejoicing. The year passed pleasantly to the <lb/>
Princess. She and her husband spent three happy months <lb/>
in England, and on their return received a good many <lb/>
guests at Kranichstein.</p>
<p>But amid social duties and pleasures, Princess Alice's <lb/>
earnest mind did not lose sight of her higher duties and <lb/>
responsibilities. She became the "Protectress" of the <lb/>
Heidenreich Institution for Lying-in-Women, which was <lb/>
<pb n="305" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0334"/>
the beginning of the active interest taken by her in <lb/>
all sanitary improvements. She writes to her mother, <lb/>
a most interesting description of this charity: "I am <lb/>
patroness of the 'Heidenreich Stiftung,' to which you also <lb/>
gave a handsome present in the beginning. The ladies <lb/>
who belong to it take linen to poor respectable women <lb/>
in child-birth who claim their assistance. They bring <lb/>
them food, and, in short, help them. All cases are <lb/>
reported to me. The other day I went <hi rend="italic">incog</hi>. with Christa <lb/>
in the old part of the town&mdash;and the trouble we had to <lb/>
find the house! At length, through a dirty courtyard, up <lb/>
a dark ladder into one little room, where lay in one bed <lb/>
the poor woman and her baby; in the room four other <lb/>
children, the husband, two other beds and a stove. But <lb/>
it did not smell bad, nor was it dirty. I sent Christa <lb/>
down with the children, then with the husband cooked <lb/>
something for the woman, arranged her bed a little, took <lb/>
her baby for her, bathed its eyes &lpar;for they were so bad, <lb/>
poor little thing!&rpar; and did odds and ends for her. I went <lb/>
twice. The people did not know me, and were so nice, so <lb/>
good, and touchingly attached to each other, it did one's <lb/>
heart good to see such good feelings in such poverty."</p>
<p>On November 1st a second daughter was born to Princess <lb/>
Alice, who received the name, Elizabeth Alexandra Louise <lb/>
Alice. Her Memoir informs us: "The Princess was very <lb/>
proud of being able to nurse her child herself, and from <lb/>
this time she took up with the keenest interest all questions <lb/>
relating to the physical, mental and moral training of <lb/>
children. She found an able supporter and independent <lb/>
adviser in Dr. Weber, a very eminent medical man resident <lb/>
at Darmstadt.</p>
<p>"The little daughter," she writes, "was but a momentary <lb/>
disappointment to us, which we have quite got over. <lb/>
We console ourselves with the idea that the little pair will <lb/>
look very pretty together." And again: "We liked <lb/>
<pb n="306" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0335"/>
Elizabeth on account of St. Elizabeth being the ancestress <lb/>
of the Hessian as well as the Saxon House."</p>
<p>In January 1865 Prince and Princess Louis of Hesse <lb/>
paid their long deferred visit to Berlin, and were received <lb/>
with the greatest kindness by the King and Queen of <lb/>
Prussia, who had been much attached to Princess Alice <lb/>
in her childhood.</p>
<p>A great trouble came to the Grand-Ducal family in April, <lb/>
when they received the news of the death of the young <lb/>
Grand-Duchess of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Prince Louis' <lb/>
only sister, "die Prinzesschen," who had been the pet <lb/>
of the house. She had died a few days after giving birth <lb/>
to a daughter. This sad event made a deep impression <lb/>
on the Princess. In May she writes as though her thoughts <lb/>
were occupied by grave subjects.</p>
<p>"I read serious books a good deal, and of a Sunday <lb/>
together we read out of Robertson's Sermons. In the <lb/>
second series there is one, 'The Irreparable Past,' for <lb/>
young people, so cheering, so encouraging, so useful. <lb/>
Louis read it to me on his return from Schwerin after <lb/>
poor Anna's death. A short life indeed, and it makes me <lb/>
feel the uncertainty of life, and the necessity of labour, <lb/>
self-denial, charity, and all those virtues which we ought to <lb/>
strive after. Oh that I may die having done my work <lb/>
and not sinned with <foreign lang="ger"><hi rend="italic">Unterlassung des Guten</hi></foreign> &lpar;omission to <lb/>
do what is good&rpar;, the fault into which it is easiest to fall!"</p>
<p>And in her letter of December 30th: "This is my last <lb/>
letter this year. In many ways a happy one has it been, <lb/>
though it has deprived us of many dear and near ones. <lb/>
Each year brings us nearer the <foreign lang="ger"><hi rend="italic">Wiedersehen</hi></foreign> &lpar;reunion with <lb/>
the dead&rpar;, though it is sad to think how one's glass is <lb/>
running out, and how little good goes with it compared <lb/>
to the numberless blessings we receive."</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> following year the new palace was completed, <lb/>
much to the Princess' satisfaction. She also extended <lb/>
the field of her practical usefulness. She took a good deal <lb/>
of interest in the idea of founding special asylums for poor <lb/>
idiots, and organised a grand bazaar in her new palace; <lb/>
indeed, she sympathised with all good works.</p>
<p>Her inward life was not without its conflicts and troubles, <lb/>
and her strong, earnest nature came into contact with many <lb/>
serious questions.</p>
<p>To quote from her Memoir: "The traces of perfect trust <lb/>
in God, and entire submission to His will, will be found <lb/>
throughout her letters. We know at one time she wavered <lb/>
in her convictions. Although she never doubted the value <lb/>
of practical religion, although she ever turned to her Bible <lb/>
for help and comfort in hours of distress and anxiety, she <lb/>
had to wrestle heart and soul with theoretical doubts. It <lb/>
seems to have been a struggle of many years' duration, at <lb/>
the commencement and end of which personal influences <lb/>
played a great part."</p>
<pb n="308" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0337"/>
<p>An intimate friend of the Princess furnishes some <reg orig="inter-|esting">interesting</reg> <lb/>
details on this subject. "After her son's death," <lb/>
she writes, "I observed a great change in her feelings. <lb/>
Before that time&hellip; she had allowed herself to be led <lb/>
away by the free-thinking philosophical views of others. <lb/>
After Prince Fritz died she never spoke in such a way <lb/>
again.&hellip; Some time afterwards she told me herself, in <lb/>
the most simple and touching manner, how this change had <lb/>
come about. I could not listen to her story without tears. <lb/>
The Princess told me she owed it all to the child's death <lb/>
and to the influence of a Scotch gentleman, a friend of the <lb/>
Grand-Duke and the Grand-Duchess, who was residing with <lb/>
his family at Darmstadt.</p>
<p>"I owe all to this kind friend," was her remark; and a <lb/>
note appended to this memorandum informs us that Princess <lb/>
Alice "returned to the faith in which she was reared, and <lb/>
died in it a devout Christian."</p>
<p>The unfortunate conflict about the Duchies of <reg orig="Schleswig-|Holstein">Schleswig-Holstein</reg> <lb/>
had brought about the war of 1866. The Princess' <lb/>
German sympathies made her regard the struggle with great <lb/>
pain&mdash;"brother against brother," as she expresses it.</p>
<p>Prince Louis was obliged to assume command of his <lb/>
army, but he happened to be on leave for a few days when <lb/>
the Princess gave birth to her third daughter. This was on <lb/>
July 11th, and on the 14th he had to bid her farewell and <lb/>
go into action at Aschaffenburg. In a letter to the Queen <lb/>
she announces the birth of a strong, healthy girl, "with dark <lb/>
eyes and brown hair." "Baby is well and very pretty," she <lb/>
writes. "The time she came prevented a thought of <reg orig="dis-|appointment">disappointment</reg> <lb/>
at her being a girl. Only gratitude to the <lb/>
Almighty filled our hearts that I and the child were well, <lb/>
and dear Louis and I were together at the time. The <lb/>
times are hard. It wants all a Christian's courage and <lb/>
patience to carry one through them; but there is one Friend <lb/>
who in the time of need does not forsake one, and He is my <lb/>
<pb n="309" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0338"/>
comfort and support." It was indeed a trying time for the <lb/>
anxious wife, left to endure such suspense in her weakness.</p>
<p>"These last four days they have been fighting again," she <lb/>
writes. "I had a few lines from him &lpar;Prince Louis&rpar;. These <lb/>
last two nights he slept in a field, and the country is so poor <lb/>
that they had nothing but a little bread to eat. Now, the <lb/>
Prussians, having made peace with the Austrians, and having <lb/>
refused it to us, are advancing on our troops from three <lb/>
sides. I can scarcely write, this anxiety is killing me.&hellip; <lb/>
What I have suffered and do suffer no words can describe. <lb/>
The sleepless nights of anxiety, the long days without news: <lb/>
how I pray it may soon end, and dear, darling Louis be <lb/>
spared to me."</p>
<p>On July 21st the Prussians, under General von G&ouml;ben, <lb/>
entered Darmstadt. Prince Louis' parents were daily with <lb/>
the Princess. As soon as her strength permitted, Princess <lb/>
Alice began to interest herself in the wounded.</p>
<p>"I have just returned from having been to enquire after <lb/>
the wounded at the different hospitals and houses, which <lb/>
are filling fast as they can be brought in from Aschaffenburg, <lb/>
Laubach, etc. As soon as I am better I will go to them <lb/>
myself, but the close and crowded wards turn one easily <lb/>
faint."</p>
<p>On August 8th, on her way home from visiting her <lb/>
parents-in-law, the Princess had the happiness of meeting <lb/>
her husband unexpectedly in the street. He had obtained <lb/>
leave of absence during a short armistice.</p>
<p>The Memoir tells us that the Prince and Princess together <lb/>
visited the wounded, and on August 11th the Prince was <lb/>
appointed by the Grand-Duke to the command of the <lb/>
Hessian Division then in the field.</p>
<p>"He took up his quarters in the 'Gelbe Haus' at <lb/>
Trierstein-Oppenheim, and the Princess courageously shared <lb/>
them with him, in spite of the cholera raging there."</p>
<p>On September 12th the little Princess was christened at <lb/>
<pb n="310" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0339"/>
Darmstadt, the very day peace was ratified at Berlin, and <lb/>
received the names of Irene &lpar;Peace&rpar; Louise Marie Anna. <lb/>
The cavalry brigade the Prince had commanded stood <lb/>
sponsors to the child. On September 20th the Prince and <lb/>
Princess, with the Hessian division, made a public entry <lb/>
into Darmstadt.</p>
<p>This disastrous war had shown the necessity for a more <lb/>
efficient organisation for aid to the sick and wounded. In <lb/>
1865 a society had been formed in Hesse, under the <lb/>
patronage of Prince and Princess Charles, and had done <lb/>
good work in the war. Deaconesses, Sisters of Mercy, <lb/>
and other ladies had hitherto nursed the wounded, but <lb/>
now it was felt to be desirable that specially qualified <lb/>
nurses should be trained for the purpose.</p>
<p>The Princess took the deepest interest in this question. <lb/>
She had the example of Florence Nightingale before her <lb/>
eyes, and her work in the Crimea; she therefore eagerly <lb/>
took up the idea of founding a "Frauen-Verein," or <lb/>
Ladies' Union.</p>
<p>"The central committee," we are informed, "was to be <lb/>
at Darmstadt, under the Princess' direction. The other <lb/>
committees spread over the whole country. Its object was <lb/>
to assist 'the nursing and supporting of troops in times of <lb/>
war,' and in times of peace 'to train nurses to assist other <lb/>
hospitals, or amongst the poor, or to nurse the rich'; in <lb/>
fact, wherever help was required."</p>
<p>In 1869 the members of the Ladies' Union numbered <lb/>
2500. At the same time the Princess was much occupied <lb/>
in "the improvement of the condition of poor unmarried <lb/>
women and girls, as well as the education of girls in <lb/>
general." The distinguished authoress, Fr&auml;ulein Louise <lb/>
B&uuml;chner, was her able assistant. A permanent Bazaar, <lb/>
called "The Alice Bazaar," was also founded for the <lb/>
encouragement of female industry. In this year the <lb/>
Prince and Princess paid visits to Gotha and Berlin, and <lb/>
<pb n="311" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0340"/>
also visited the great International Exhibition at Paris. <lb/>
They then crossed over to England, and were present at <lb/>
Windsor and Osborne during the visits of the Sultan. <lb/>
Later in the year they went to St. Moritz, in the Engadine, <lb/>
where the Princess took the baths.</p>
<p>The following year the Princess spent the months of <lb/>
June and July in England with her three little girls; and <lb/>
on November 25th, 1868, to the great joy of herself and <lb/>
her husband, a son and heir was born, "a splendid boy." <lb/>
At his christening he received the names Ernst Ludwig <lb/>
Albert Charles William. The sponsors were the Queen of <lb/>
England and the King of Prussia.</p>
<p>The year 1869 opened quietly and peacefully for the <lb/>
Princess. In May she and her husband and their four <lb/>
children spent four delightful weeks with the Crown Prince <lb/>
and Princess at Potsdam, and later in the year they visited <lb/>
Silesia and Dresden, where they were the guests of the <lb/>
King and Queen of Saxony at their country seat, Pillnitz.</p>
<p>The Princess' last letter from Potsdam expresses her <lb/>
regret that her happy visit was at an end:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Our time here is soon drawing to a close, much to my <lb/>
regret; for the life with dear Vicky, so quiet and pleasant, <lb/>
reminds me in many things of our life in England in former <lb/>
happy days, and so much that we had Vicky has copied for <lb/>
her children. Yet we both always say to each other, no <lb/>
children were so happy and so spoilt with all the enjoyments <lb/>
and comforts children can wish for as we were; and that <lb/>
we can never &lsqb;of course, still less I&rsqb; give our children all <lb/>
that we had."</p>
<p>Later in the year the Prince and Princess of Wales and <lb/>
their family paid the Prince and Princess Louis a visit at <lb/>
Kranichstein, and on October 15th the opening of the <lb/>
idiot asylum took place. Prince Louis had arranged to <lb/>
accompany the Crown Prince to the East on the occasion <lb/>
of the opening of the Suez canal. They were to visit <lb/>
<pb n="312" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0341"/>
Palestine, and journey up the Nile as far as the first and <lb/>
second cataract.</p>
<p>During the absence of their husbands the Crown Princess <lb/>
and Princess Alice, with her little son, went to Cannes. <lb/>
"We sisters are singularly blessed in our husbands," writes <lb/>
the Princess; and in another letter she speaks affectionately <lb/>
of her sister. "I have been so much with dear Vicky this <lb/>
year, that the thought of parting from her costs me a great <lb/>
pang, the more so as I do not think it likely that I shall <lb/>
meet her in this new year."</p>
<p>The beginning of the year brought fresh anxiety to the <lb/>
Princess. Soon after his return from his tour in the East, <lb/>
Prince Louis was laid up with scarlet fever, and soon after <lb/>
Princess Victoria and the baby Prince took the infection; <lb/>
the other children had colds and coughs, and seemed ailing. <lb/>
The Princess nursed them with the utmost devotion. In <lb/>
one of her early letters she writes: "I read to Louis and <lb/>
play to him, as my sitting-room opens into the bedroom. <lb/>
I keep the rooms well aired and not hot, and at night I <lb/>
sleep on a sofa near his bed. The first two nights were <lb/>
anxious ones, and I was up all night alone with him; but <lb/>
now, thank God, all seems going well."</p>
<p>During this time of enforced retirement Princess Alice <lb/>
found her intercourse with the famous writer and theologian, <lb/>
David Friedrich Strauss, a great source of pleasure.</p>
<p>She had made his acquaintance in 1868 by her own <lb/>
desire. Strauss himself speaks thus of the Princess: <lb/>
"Although I was entirely unaccustomed to associate with <lb/>
persons of high rank, I soon felt entirely at ease with this <lb/>
lady. Her simplicity, the kind manner in which she met <lb/>
me, and her keen, bright intellect, made me forget all <lb/>
difference of social position." He paid her many visits, <lb/>
and their conversations often lasted for hours; they even <lb/>
read aloud together. During Prince Louis' illness the <lb/>
Princess suggested that, if Strauss were not afraid of infection, <lb/>
<pb n="313" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0342"/>
he should come and read to her his lectures on Voltaire, <lb/>
as her life for some weeks would be very solitary; and to <lb/>
this he willingly agreed. After a good deal of <reg orig="corres-|pondence">correspondence</reg>, <lb/>
the book on Voltaire was dedicated to the <lb/>
Princess with her husband's permission. The Princess <lb/>
writes to him from Kranichstein: "I have not been able <lb/>
till to-day to thank you for your Voltaire, received yesterday. <lb/>
The book itself is the cause of the delay, as I devoted my <lb/>
spare time to reading over what you had yourself read to <lb/>
me so beautifully last winter. I seemed to hear your voice <lb/>
and all your observations again. I must thank you once <lb/>
more for that great enjoyment, and for the kind terms of <lb/>
your dedication."</p>
<p>"Seldom has a Royal Princess shown herself so <lb/>
courageous and amiable," was Strauss' observation after <lb/>
this. But it was in accordance with Princess Alice's <lb/>
generosity and upright nature to avow her friendship for <lb/>
Strauss boldly; and though her views differed from his <lb/>
more and more as time went on, she always regarded him <lb/>
with esteem and gratitude.</p>
<p>When all danger of infection was over, the Prince and <lb/>
Princess with their family went to Mayence for change of <lb/>
air. While there the Princess visited several hospitals.</p>
<p>Their quiet time at Kranichstein in the summer was <lb/>
brought to an end by the declaration of war between France <lb/>
and Germany, and Prince Louis had to start for the front. <lb/>
He occupied a central position during the terrible battle of <lb/>
Gravelotte. He and his division also formed part of the <lb/>
army investing Metz, and it was while expecting a sortie of <lb/>
the French on October 8th that the news of the birth of a <lb/>
second son reached him.</p>
<p>All those weeks the Princess had remained "at her post" <lb/>
at Darmstadt, striving to alleviate the suffering of the sick <lb/>
and wounded, She visited the hospitals and ambulances <lb/>
at the railway station every day, and in her own palace <lb/>
<pb n="314" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0343"/>
arranged a dep&ocirc;t for all necessaries required for the <lb/>
wounded. Numbers of ladies waited to serve out <reg orig="refresh-|ments">refreshments</reg> <lb/>
night and day to the sufferers halting at the railway <lb/>
stations.</p>
<p>"One of the hospitals erected by the English National <lb/>
Red Cross Society, and supplied with English surgeons, <lb/>
received the name of the Alice Hospital. In spite of her <lb/>
anxiety, the little new-born Prince thrived, and the Princess <lb/>
made a fair recovery. The christening was deferred in <lb/>
the hope of Prince Louis' return, and took place quietly <lb/>
the following February, the child receiving the names of <lb/>
Frederick William Augustus Victor Louis.</p>
<p>Princess Alice's letters during the trying months that <lb/>
preceded her child's birth tell of severe strain and exhausting <lb/>
labour. "I have tried to write as often as I could, but I <lb/>
have only two hours to myself during the whole day through <lb/>
driving in here &lpar;Darmstadt&rpar; twice a day. Besides the large <lb/>
H&uuml;lfsverein for the wounded and sick soldiers which is in <lb/>
our palace, I have daily to visit the four hospitals. There <lb/>
is so much to do; we are so near the seat of war. This <lb/>
morning we got two large waggons ready and sent off for <lb/>
Pont-&agrave;-Mousson where they telegraph from the battlefield <lb/>
of the 16th they are in great want. My best nurses are out <lb/>
there, the others are in three hospitals; two of them, <lb/>
military ones, were not ready or organised when 150 <lb/>
wounded arrived a week ago."</p>
<p>And again: "I have suffered much, and the load of <lb/>
anxiety is great! But thousands of Germans bear this load <lb/>
in unity together for their Fatherland, and none murmur. <lb/>
Yesterday a poor woman came to me to ask me to help her <lb/>
to get to the battlefield, to have the body of her only son <lb/>
looked for and brought home; and she was so resigned and <lb/>
patient."</p>
<p>And in another letter: "Hourly almost the trains bring <lb/>
in fresh wounded, and many and shocking are the sights <lb/>
<pb n="315" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0344"/>
one sees.&hellip; It is ten days since Louis has been in a bed <lb/>
or under a roof. They have no water &lpar;it is kept for the <lb/>
wounded&rpar; and little to eat, but he is very well." And a <lb/>
little later: "My dear parents-in-law bear up well; but when <lb/>
we three get together we pour our hearts out to each other, <lb/>
and then tears which are full of anxiety will flow."</p>
<p>As soon as the Princess recovered strength she resumed <lb/>
her visits to the hospitals. "My wounded were so pleased <lb/>
to see me again yesterday," she writes. "Alas! many in <lb/>
bed and so ill still. My two in the house are much better, <lb/>
and the one who during six weeks lay at death's door is <lb/>
recovering. I have seldom experienced so great satisfaction <lb/>
as seeing this young man recover, and the doctors say I <lb/>
have been the means of saving his life. The joy of the old <lb/>
parents will be very great. Since I left there are new <lb/>
widows and fresh parents bereft of only children; it is a <lb/>
painful duty to go to them. But I know the comfort of <lb/>
sympathy is the only one in deep grief."</p>
<p>Now and then there is a touching passage in her letters to <lb/>
the Queen. "One of the poor wounded soldiers whom I <lb/>
gave your cape to, is dying, and the poor boy won't part <lb/>
with it for an instant, and holds it tight round himself." <lb/>
And again: "The poor soldier who had your cape is dead; <lb/>
he died with it round him. I was with him in the afternoon, <lb/>
and he had tears in his eyes, and was very low. In the <lb/>
night he died. This morning I was at the station to give <lb/>
things to the wounded and sick who came through&mdash;a sorry <lb/>
sight. This afternoon I am going to a poor soldier's widow <lb/>
who has just had twins. The distress on all sides is great <lb/>
I help when I can. Becker tears his hair. The two <lb/>
wounded in the house cost so much. So does everything <lb/>
else; but as long as I can, through sparing on myself, help <lb/>
others, I must do it, though I have, as things are now, <lb/>
nothing left."</p>
<p>There is another pathetic entry: "I have little news to <lb/>
<pb n="316" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0345"/>
give. I go about to the poor soldiers' widows and wives&mdash; <lb/>
no end of them, with new-born babes, in the greatest <lb/>
distress. Yesterday I saw the mother of the poor young <lb/>
soldier who died. She keeps your cape as a precious relic, <lb/>
as it had given him such pleasure."</p>
<p>The armistice and capitulation of Paris caused great relief <lb/>
to the Princess. On February 2nd she writes: "Now that <lb/>
there is a prospect of peace, and that the fighting is <lb/>
momentarily over, I feel quite a collapse of my nerves after <lb/>
the strain that has been on them for six whole months. I <lb/>
can scarcely imagine what it will be when my beloved Louis <lb/>
is at home again; it seems too great a joy." And on the <lb/>
11th she writes: "To-day our little son is to be christened, <lb/>
but only the family will be present, and my ladies, and the <lb/>
two wounded gentlemen, who can get about on crutches. <lb/>
&hellip; How I shall miss dear Louis to-day! The seven <lb/>
months will be round ere we meet, I fear, and he has never <lb/>
seen his little boy. It always makes me sad to look at <lb/>
him, though now I have every reason to hope, please God, <lb/>
that I shall have the joy of seeing Louis come home, and of <lb/>
placing his baby in his arms.&hellip; I pray that peace may <lb/>
be restored, and that I may not live to see such a war again, <lb/>
or to see my sons go to it."</p>
<p>On March 21st the devoted wife awaited her husband at <lb/>
the Darmstadt railway station. Prince Louis had ten days' <lb/>
leave of absence.</p>
<p>The longed for peace was proclaimed at last, and on <lb/>
June 16th the Princess accompanied her husband to Berlin, <lb/>
to be present at the triumphal entry of the German troops. <lb/>
"Anything more grand, more imposing or touching and <lb/>
<foreign lang="ger"><hi rend="italic">erhebend</hi></foreign> &lpar;elevating&rpar; than the entry of the troops into <lb/>
Berlin, I never saw," she writes. "It was a wonderful <lb/>
sight to drive for three-quarters of an hour through rows <lb/>
of French cannon. The decorations were so artistic, so <lb/>
handsome, and the enthusiasm of the dense crowds quite <lb/>
<pb n="317" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0346"/>
enormous. I am glad to have been there; it will be a <lb/>
thing to recollect."</p>
<p>In August the Princess with her husband and family <lb/>
spent three weeks at Blankenberghe, to recruit after the <lb/>
strain and fatigue of the last few months; and afterwards <lb/>
they went to London, and arrived at Balmoral on September <lb/>
13th. They found the Queen in a suffering condition, and <lb/>
remained with her until November 1st; but the children, <lb/>
who had caught whooping cough, returned to London, <lb/>
leaving their parents at Balmoral.</p>

</epigraph>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">In</hi> November Princess Alice and her husband paid a <lb/>
visit to Sandringham, and on the 9th she wrote to the <lb/>
Queen: "It is the first time since eleven years that I have <lb/>
spent Bertie's birthday with him; and though we are only <lb/>
three of our family together, still that is better than nothing, <lb/>
and makes it seem more like a birthday. Bertie and Alix are <lb/>
so kind, and give us so warm a welcome, showing how they <lb/>
like having us, that it feels quite home. Indeed, I pray <lb/>
earnestly that God's blessing may rest on him, and that he <lb/>
may be guided to do what is wise and right, so that he may <lb/>
tide safely through the anxious times that are before him, <lb/>
and in which we live."</p>
<p>Princess Alice little knew, as she wrote so happily and <lb/>
affectionately of her brother, of the terrible days of suspense <lb/>
that were approaching. Shortly afterwards the Prince of <lb/>
Wales, who had gone to London, was seriously indisposed; <lb/>
but on finding himself worse, he insisted on returning to his <lb/>
Norfolk home.</p>
<p>It proved to be typhoid fever. The Prince, his groom, <lb/>
Blegge, and Lord Chesterfield, who had all been at <lb/>
<pb n="319" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0348"/>
Scarborough with Lord Londesborough, were stricken <reg orig="simul-|taneously">simultaneously</reg>. <lb/>
Sad to say, both Lord Chesterfield and the <lb/>
groom died; but the Prince's youth and good constitution <lb/>
were in his favour, but for some days his condition was <lb/>
extremely critical.</p>
<p>Great alarm was felt throughout the kingdom, for ten <lb/>
years before his beloved father had succumbed to this <lb/>
terrible fever; but on the anniversary of his death, <lb/>
December 14th, improvement in the Prince of Wales' <lb/>
condition set in. Prince Louis had been obliged to go <lb/>
back to Darmstadt for a time; but Princess Alice remained <lb/>
and helped the Princess of Wales nurse the patient. Nothing <lb/>
could exceed the wife's and sister's devotion. The Princess <lb/>
wrote to her mother in these touching words the following <lb/>
December: "That our good, sweet Alix should have been <lb/>
spared this terrible grief, when this time last year it seemed <lb/>
so imminent, fills my heart with gratitude for her dear sake, <lb/>
as for yours, his children and ours.&hellip; The 14th will now <lb/>
be a day of mixed recollections and feelings to us, a day <lb/>
hallowed in our family, when one great spirit ended his <lb/>
work on earth, though his work can never die, and <reg orig="genera-|tions">generations</reg> <lb/>
will grow up and call his name blessed; and when <lb/>
another was left to fulfil his duty and mission, God grant, <lb/>
for the welfare of his own family and of thousands."</p>
<p>Princess Alice did not return to Darmstadt until the end <lb/>
of January. On June 6th another daughter was born, who <lb/>
afterwards received the names of Victoria Alix Helena <lb/>
Louise Beatrice. The Prince and Princess of Wales were <lb/>
among the sponsors.</p>
<p>During this year the Princess interested herself in all the <lb/>
charitable institutions which she had founded; she also <lb/>
instituted an orphan asylum, which proved a great success.</p>
<p>The general assembly at Darmstadt, the "Frauen Tag" <lb/>
or "Ladies' Diet," was distinguished this year by the <lb/>
presence of several remarkable people&mdash;Madame Marie <lb/>
<pb n="320" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0349"/>
Simon, the founder and head of the Institution for Training <lb/>
Nurses at Dresden, and three English ladies, Miss Mary <lb/>
Carpenter, Miss Florence Hill, and Miss Winkworth.</p>
<p>"My associations take up a great deal of my time and <lb/>
thought," the Princess wrote to her mother, "and require <lb/>
a great deal of study.&hellip; We have had some satisfactory <lb/>
results in the class of the workwomen, and in the reform <lb/>
of the school; but there are many open questions yet, <lb/>
which I hope this meeting with others who work in the <lb/>
same field may help us to solve." And in another letter: <lb/>
"The English ladies were kind enough to speak&mdash;only <lb/>
think, old Miss Carpenter!&mdash;on all relating to women's work <lb/>
in England &lpar;she is our guest here&rpar;;&hellip; Miss Hill &lpar;also <lb/>
our guest&rpar; about the boarding-out system for orphans; <lb/>
Miss C. Winkworth about higher education in England. <lb/>
&hellip; The presence of the English ladies&mdash;above all, of <lb/>
one such as Miss Carpenter, who has done such good <lb/>
work for the reformation of convicts&mdash;greatly enhanced the <lb/>
importance of the meeting, and her great experience has <lb/>
been of value to us all."</p>
<p>In an interesting series of articles, written on the <lb/>
"Daughters of Queen Victoria," by Sarah Tooley, there <lb/>
is a passage that touches on this side of Princess Alice's <lb/>
life:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Despite her high estate, she shared the lot of most <lb/>
progressive philanthropists in being abused and <reg orig="misunder-|stood">misunderstood</reg> <lb/>
by the very people at whose feet she was laying <lb/>
the rich treasures of her noble mind and heart. She had <lb/>
to combat many prejudices; and the mere fact that she <lb/>
was an Englishwoman, with broad and liberal views, <lb/>
made her an object of suspicion among certain sections <lb/>
of German society. Very keen was the unhappiness <lb/>
this brought her; but the sympathy of her husband, and <lb/>
the love and esteem of those in her immediate circle, <lb/>
encouraged her to persevere with her scheme, and she <lb/>
<pb n="321" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0350"/>
was rewarded by the knowledge that the poor, the <reg orig="deso-|late">desolate</reg>, <lb/>
and the oppressed wept tears of thankfulness, and <lb/>
grew to venerate her as the mother of her people."</p>
<p>The Princess' habits of industry were truly admirable. <lb/>
In a letter in 1866 she wrote thus to her mother: "I have <lb/>
made all the summer walking-out dresses, seven in number, <lb/>
with paletots, for the girls, not embroidered, but entirely <lb/>
made from beginning to end; likewise the new necessary <lb/>
flannels for the expected. I manage all the nursery <lb/>
accounts and everything myself." Music and sketching <lb/>
were the Princess' favourite recreations, and she read much <lb/>
of the best literature of the day.</p>
<p>The year 1873 began brightly for the Princess, though, <lb/>
alas! it was to end in sorrow. Little Prince Fritz, whose <lb/>
health had given her much anxiety, seemed stronger and <lb/>
better, and in March she was able to carry out a much <lb/>
cherished plan, and visit Italy. She travelled incognito, <lb/>
accompanied by Miss Hardinge and Tufnell-Roland. Her <lb/>
route was by Munich and the Brenner Pass to Florence, <lb/>
and after staying there three days, she went to Rome.</p>
<p>In a comparatively short time the Princess accomplished <lb/>
a large amount of sight-seeing. She visited Pope Pius IX., <lb/>
who received her most kindly, and also went to the <lb/>
Quirinal to pay her respects to King Victor Emanuel and <lb/>
the Crown Princess of Italy, Princess Margherita. It was <lb/>
a time of intense enjoyment, and the Princess returned to <lb/>
Darmstadt on May 2nd, feeling refreshed in body and <lb/>
mind. But her happiness was of short duration. On <lb/>
May 29th Prince Louis left Darmstadt early in the morning <lb/>
to inspect the troops in Upper Hesse. The Princess, who <lb/>
was still fatigued from her exertions during her Italian <lb/>
journey, was resting quietly in bed.</p>
<p>The two little Princes came in to see her, and by her <lb/>
desire their nurse left them with her. What followed is <lb/>
told very briefly in her Memoirs.</p>
<pb n="322" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0351"/>
<p>"The children soon began to play, as was their wont, <lb/>
running in and out of the room into the adjacent one, and <lb/>
looking from one window and then from another. Prince <lb/>
Ernest having run into the next room, the Princess <reg orig="fol-|lowed">followed</reg>, <lb/>
leaving Prince Fritz in her bedroom. During her <lb/>
almost momentary absence he fell out of the window on <lb/>
to the stone terrace below. Whether he had leaned too <lb/>
far out of it and overbalanced himself, or whether in running <lb/>
fast through the room to the window to look for his mother <lb/>
he could not stop himself and fell from it, no one actually <lb/>
knew. He was picked up insensible, and died a few hours <lb/>
afterwards in the arms of his distracted mother. Effusion <lb/>
of blood on the brain caused by the fall ended that young <lb/>
and bright little life. The loss of this unusually gifted and <lb/>
beloved child was a blow to the mother from which she <lb/>
never recovered."</p>
<p>This was indeed sadly true. For many years the <lb/>
Princess' health had been far from strong. During the war <lb/>
time of 1870 she had overtaxed her strength; in her letters <lb/>
from time to time she complains of severe neuralgia, and <lb/>
she had also trouble with her eyes. After her boy's death, <lb/>
those who knew her noticed a look in her eyes as of one <lb/>
whose thoughts are dwelling in a sad past. "The horror <lb/>
of my darling's sudden death," she writes in June, "at times <lb/>
torments me too much, particularly waking of a morning; <lb/>
but when I think he is at rest, free from the sorrow we are <lb/>
suffering, and from every evil to come, I feel quite resigned. <lb/>
He was such a bright child. It seems so quiet next door. <lb/>
I miss the little feet coming to me, for we lived so much <lb/>
together; and Ernie feels so lost, poor love." And <lb/>
again: "My darling sweet child, to have lost him so! To <lb/>
my grave shall I carry this sorrow with me. In the book <lb/>
you sent me there is a fine poem by Miss Procter, 'Our <lb/>
Grief our Friend,' called 'Friend Sorrow,' which expresses <lb/>
so much what I myself feel about a deep grief." And a <lb/>
<pb n="323" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0352"/>
little later on to that beloved mother she writes: "You <lb/>
feel so with me, when you understand how long and deep <lb/>
my grief must be. And does one not grow to love one's grief, <lb/>
as having become part of the being one loved, as if through <lb/>
this one could still pay a tribute of love to them, to make <lb/>
up for the terrible loss, and missing of not being able to do <lb/>
anything for the beloved one any more? I am so much <lb/>
with my children, and am so accustomed to care for them <lb/>
and their wants daily, that I miss not having Frittie, the <lb/>
object of our greatest care, far more than words can <lb/>
describe; and in the quiet of our everyday life, when we <lb/>
have only the children around us, it is doubly and trebly <lb/>
felt, and is a sorrow that has entered into the very heart of <lb/>
our existence." A still more pathetic passage comes later: <lb/>
"You ask if I can play yet? I feel as if I could not, and <lb/>
I have not yet done so. In my own house it seems to me <lb/>
as if I never could play again on that piano, where little <lb/>
hands were nearly always thrust when I wanted to play: <lb/>
away from home&mdash;in England&mdash;much sooner. I had <lb/>
played so often lately that splendid touching funeral march <lb/>
of Chopin's, and I remember it was the last thing I played, <lb/>
and then the two boys were running about the room."</p>
<p>The following year, May 24th, the Princess' last child <lb/>
was born, the Princess Marie Victoria Feodora Leopoldine, <lb/>
and a great part of the summer was spent at <reg orig="Blanken-|berghe">Blankenberghe</reg>. <lb/>
The Princess' letters still breathe profound <reg orig="depres-|sion">depression</reg>, <lb/>
and on their return to Kranichstein she writes, in <lb/>
speaking of their little ones: "'Sunny' is the picture of <lb/>
robust health, and sweet little 'sister Maly' sits up quite <lb/>
alone, and is very neat and rosy, with such quick eyes, and <lb/>
two deep dimples in her cheeks&mdash;a great pet, and so like <lb/>
my poor Frittie. The return here has been very painful, <lb/>
and days of deep depression still come, when I am tormented <lb/>
with the dreadful remembrance of the day I lost him. Too <lb/>
cruel and agonising are those thoughts. I dwell on his <lb/>
<pb n="324" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0353"/>
rest and peace, and that our sufferings he cannot know. <lb/>
What might not life have brought him? Better so! but <lb/>
hard to say, 'God's will be done.'"</p>
<p>Each year Princess Alice made some public effort to <lb/>
collect funds for her charitable institutions, and well known <lb/>
artists offered their services.</p>
<p>At the beginning of 1875 the Prince and Princess and <lb/>
their children spent two months in England; and the <lb/>
following year, 1876, though the routine of their daily <lb/>
life went on as usual, repeated attacks of exhaustion and <lb/>
weakness tried the Princess. A short stay in the Black <lb/>
Forest and a visit to England and Scotland were of some <lb/>
benefit to her. "I have never in my life been like this <lb/>
before," she writes. "I live on my sofa and in the air, and <lb/>
see no one, and yet go on losing strength." The air of her <lb/>
beloved Highlands refreshed and strengthened her, and on <lb/>
her return home she wrote more brightly. "The happiness <lb/>
of our meeting with the dear children was very great&mdash;they <lb/>
eat me up! They had made wreaths over the door, and <lb/>
had no end of things to tell me. We arrived at three, and <lb/>
there was not a moment's rest till they were all in bed, and <lb/>
I had heard the different prayers and hymns of the six, <lb/>
with all the little different confidences they had to make. <lb/>
My heart was full of joy and gratitude at being with them <lb/>
once more."</p>
<p>The year 1877 brought sad changes to the Ducal House <lb/>
of Hesse. Prince Charles, the father of Prince Louis, was <lb/>
seized with erysipelas on March 11th, and passed peacefully <lb/>
away on the 20th, surrounded by his sorrowing family. <lb/>
The Grand-Duke, who was deeply affected by his brother's <lb/>
death, was seized with serious illness a month later, and <lb/>
died on June 13th; and Prince Louis, being the next heir, <lb/>
ascended the throne as Grand-Duke Louis IV.</p>
<p>Princess Alice, who was much attached to her father-<reg orig="in-|law">in-law</reg>, <lb/>
was full of sorrow at his loss. "The recollections of <lb/>
<pb n="325" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0354"/>
1861, of dear Frittie's death, when my dear father-in-law <lb/>
was so tender and kind," she wrote, "were painfully vivid. <lb/>
My mother-in-law's resignation and touching goodness, <lb/>
doing all that she could during the illness and since for <lb/>
all arrangements, is very beautiful!&hellip; His was a singularly <lb/>
delicate-minded, pure, true, unselfish nature, so full of <reg orig="con-|sideration">consideration</reg> <lb/>
for others, so kind, my tears flow incessantly, for <lb/>
I loved him very dearly. My dear mother-in-law has such <lb/>
a broken, ruined existence now&mdash;all changed round her! <lb/>
She knows where to find strength and comfort. It will not <lb/>
fail her.&hellip;" And a month later, when the Grand-Duke <lb/>
was lying in mortal sickness: "We are going through a <lb/>
dreadful ordeal!&hellip; The questions, long discussions <lb/>
between Louis and some people as to complication and <lb/>
difficulty of every kind, that will fall upon us at once, are <lb/>
really dreadful, and I so unfit just now! The confusion <lb/>
will be dreadful.&hellip; I am so dreading everything, and <lb/>
above all the responsibility of being the first in everything, <lb/>
and people are not <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italic">bienveillant</hi></foreign>."</p>
<p>After the first press of business and official receptions <lb/>
were over, the Grand-Duke and Grand-Duchess went to <lb/>
the little watering-place of Houlgate in Normandy. The <lb/>
Grand-Duke only went as far as Metz, but later on he <lb/>
and the children followed the Grand-Duchess.</p>
<p>The rest and change were of great benefit to her, and <lb/>
when she returned to Darmstadt as Landesmutter, "mother <lb/>
of the country," she had a warm and enthusiastic reception. <lb/>
She at once resumed her charitable work. "&hellip; I had to <lb/>
receive sixty-five ladies," she writes in October, "amongst <lb/>
them my nurses, and some doctors from here and other <lb/>
towns, all belonging to my Nursing Society, which has <lb/>
existed ten years. Then I was at the opening of my <lb/>
Industrial Girls' School, where girls from all parts of the <lb/>
country come, and which is a great success. I started it two <lb/>
years ago. On Sunday I took the children to hear the <lb/>
<pb n="326" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0355"/>
Sunday-school, which interested them much. I have been <lb/>
doing too much lately, though, and my nerves are beginning <lb/>
to feel the strain.&hellip; It is more than my strength can <lb/>
stand in the long run."</p>
<p>The celebrated portrait-painter, Heinrich von Angeli, <lb/>
came to Darmstadt in the spring of 1878, by command of <lb/>
the Queen, to paint a family picture of the Grand-Duke and <lb/>
Grand-Duchess and their children. Angeli's picture was <lb/>
the last ever painted of Princess Alice. The summer <lb/>
months of this year were spent at Eastbourne, and the <lb/>
whole family visited the Queen at Osborne. This was the <lb/>
Princess Alice's last visit to her native land. During her <lb/>
stay at Eastbourne she visited the cottages of the <reg orig="fisher-|folk">fisher-folk</reg>, <lb/>
and took great interest in refuges and reformatories. <lb/>
She even went <foreign lang="rus"><hi rend="italic">incognito</hi></foreign> to Brighton, to visit the Albion <lb/>
Home. "I only come as one woman to another," were <lb/>
her words to Mrs. Vicars. She afterwards became Patroness <lb/>
of this Home.</p>
<p>On her return to Darmstadt the Grand-Duchess devoted <lb/>
herself to her charitable works; but, with all her energy <lb/>
and good-will her strength was no longer equal to her <lb/>
exertions. But she was ever patient. "Our home life is <lb/>
always pleasant," she writes, "never dull, however quiet. <lb/>
Only a feeling of weariness and incapacity is in itself <lb/>
a trial."</p>
<p>But the tried and chastened spirit of Princess Alice was <lb/>
to pass through more suffering before the end came. All <lb/>
her life long she had had a horror of diphtheria, and her <lb/>
anxiety was intense when the Princess Victoria was suddenly <lb/>
attacked by the treacherous disease. The child was at once <lb/>
isolated, and the Grand-Duchess superintended the nursing, <lb/>
aided by the nurses and Lady Superintendent of her own <lb/>
hospital.</p>
<p>The telegrams to the Queen tell of the mother's intense <lb/>
anxiety and anguish:&mdash;</p>
<pb n="327" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0356"/>
<list>
<item>"<hi rend="italic">November</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">th</hi>.&mdash;Victoria out of danger."</item>

such fear for the sweet little one."</item>
</list>
<p>On the 14th Prince Ernest and the Grand-Duke were <lb/>
attacked. Only one child, Princess Elizabeth, had escaped, <lb/>
and was sent to her grandmother, Princess Charles of Hesse.</p>
<p>The mother's daily reports grow more heartrending:&mdash;</p>
<list>
<item>"<hi rend="italic">November</hi> 15<hi rend="italic">th</hi>.&mdash;Darling May's state unchanged; <lb/>
heartrending. Louis' fever and illness on the increase. <lb/>
The others, as one could expect: all severe cases. May's <lb/>
most alarming."</item>
</list>
<p>Great sympathy was felt throughout the country, and <lb/>
special services were held in the churches; but on November <lb/>
16th, Princess May, "the little Sunshine," as her mother <lb/>
loved to call her, was taken to her heavenly home. "Our <lb/>
sweet little one is taken," was the poor mother's report. <lb/>
"Broke it to my Louis this morning. He is better; Ernie <lb/>
very, very ill. In great anguish."</p>
<p>On the 18th the telegram is more hopeful: "My patients <lb/>
getting better; hope soon to have them better. Last <lb/>
painful parting at three o'clock."</p>
<p>The Memoirs of the Princess Alice give a touching <lb/>
description of that parting from "her sweet May-flower." <lb/>
The coffin had to be closed very soon. It was entirely <lb/>
covered with flowers. The Grand-Duchess quietly entered <lb/>
the room where it was placed. She knelt down near it, <lb/>
pressing a corner of the pall to her lips; then she rose, and <lb/>
the funeral service began. When it was over, she cast a long, <lb/>
loving look at the coffin that hid her darling from her. She <lb/>
then left the room, and slowly walked upstairs. At the top <lb/>
of the stairs she knelt down, and, taking hold of the golden <lb/>
balustrade, looked into the mirror opposite to her to watch <lb/>
<pb n="328" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0357"/>
the little coffin being taken out of the house. She was <lb/>
marvellously calm; only long-drawn sighs escaped her. <lb/>
When all had left the palace, she went back to her <lb/>
husband, who was to be kept in ignorance of what was <lb/>
going on.</p>
<p>On November 25th the Grand-Duke was able to leave his <lb/>
bed, and on December 6th she and Prince Ernest drove out in <lb/>
a close carriage. The Princess writes a few days previously: <lb/>
"So many pangs and pains come, and must yet for years <lb/>
to come. Still, gratitude for those left is so strong, and <lb/>
indeed resignation entire and complete to a higher Will, <lb/>
and so we all feel together, and encourage each other. <lb/>
Life is not endless in this world, God be praised! There <lb/>
is much joy, but, oh! so much trial and pain; and as the <lb/>
number of those we love increases in heaven, it makes our <lb/>
passage easier, and home is there." "Brave, suffering heart!" <lb/>
but the dawn of a cloudless life was at hand.</p>
<p>On December 7th the Grand-Duchess went to the <lb/>
railway station to see the Duchess of Edinburgh, who was <lb/>
passing through Darmstadt on her way to England. That <lb/>
night she complained of feelings of illness, and the next <lb/>
morning symptoms of the dreaded disease showed <reg orig="them-|selves">themselves</reg>. <lb/>
It is supposed by some people that the Princess <lb/>
took the infection "when one day, in her grief and despair, <lb/>
she laid her head on her husband's pillow." Others say, <lb/>
that in breaking the news of their child's death the <reg orig="Grand-|Duchess">Grand-Duchess</reg> <lb/>
threw her arms round his neck and kissed him.</p>
<p>The moment she was aware of her illness, Princess Alice <lb/>
settled several things and gave various orders in case of <lb/>
her death. She bore her great sufferings with the utmost <lb/>
fortitude. "On the night of the 12th she gave many <lb/>
directions to her mother-in-law and to her lady-in-waiting. <lb/>
At times too she spoke in the most touching manner about <lb/>
her household, also inquiring kindly after poor and sick <lb/>
people in the town."</p>
<pb n="329" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0358"/>
<p>On the 13th the doctors were compelled to inform the <lb/>
Grand-Duke that his wife's condition was hopeless. Her <lb/>
Memoir tells us, that "as the danger increased, the <reg orig="Grand-|Duchess">Grand-Duchess</reg> <lb/>
expressed herself as feeling better.&hellip; When the <lb/>
Grand-Duke entered her room her joy was most evident. <lb/>
She even read two letters, the last one being from her <lb/>
mother. After some hours of heavy sleep she woke <lb/>
perfectly conscious and took some nourishment. She then <lb/>
composed herself to rest, saying, "Now I will go to sleep <lb/>
again," and out of this sleep she woke no more.</p>
<p>On December 14th, at half-past eight in the morning, <lb/>
the Princess Alice died peacefully, murmuring to herself <lb/>
like a child going to sleep: "From Friday to Saturday&mdash; <lb/>
four weeks&mdash;May, dear papa."</p>
<p>It was exactly four weeks since Princess May's death <lb/>
and seventeen years since the Prince Consort's death. "The <lb/>
14th December will now be a day of mixed recollections <lb/>
and feelings," she had written to her mother six years <lb/>
previously; "a day hallowed in our family, when one great <lb/>
spirit ended his work on earth." Little did the devoted <lb/>
daughter know, as she wrote those noble and touching <lb/>
words, that that very day six years later she was to re-join <lb/>
her beloved father. On December 17th, after a solemn <lb/>
service held by the English chaplain, the remains of the <lb/>
beloved "Landesmutter" was removed to the chapel in <lb/>
the Grand-Ducal Castle. Among the loads of wreaths and <lb/>
bouquets that were arranged round the coffin were simple <lb/>
offerings from the poor. A watcher by the dead gives <lb/>
a touching little narrative: "It was still quite early morning <lb/>
when, with the first glimmer of day, came an old peasant <lb/>
woman from the Odenwald. Advancing timidly, she laid, <lb/>
with a murmured prayer, a little wreath of rosemary, with a <lb/>
couple of white flowers, perhaps the only ornament of her <lb/>
poor little room at home, as a token of grateful affection, <lb/>
down upon the velvet pall. Then, thinking herself <lb/>
<pb n="330" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0359"/>
unnoticed, she took a rosebud from one of the splendid <lb/>
wreaths and hid it under the old woollen dress."</p>
<p>On December 18th the coffin was placed in the <lb/>
mausoleum at Rosenh&ouml;he; the Prince of Wales and Prince <lb/>
Leopold were present. A lovely recumbent monument <lb/>
by Boehm, representing the Princess with Princess May <lb/>
in her arms, is now placed over the hallowed spot where <lb/>
she rests. Truly a beautiful and noble life. An affectionate <lb/>
daughter, a devoted wife, and a most loving mother. Well <lb/>
may Princess Alice's example be enshrined in our memory! <lb/>
When her rare spirit quitted this lower sphere, the world <lb/>
seemed the poorer for her absence; if she suffered much, <lb/>
she loved much; and her tender hand and gentle sympathy <lb/>
soothed many a sick and dying bed, and the poor and the <lb/>
widow and the fatherless rose up and called her blessed.</p>
<p>When the furnace of affliction burnt the hottest, and in <lb/>
mortal agony the bereaved mother stooped to drink <lb/>
meekly of that last bitter cup, can we doubt that the <lb/>
merciful angel, "Sister Death," took her gently to that still <lb/>
land where there shall be no more death, neither sorrow <lb/>
nor crying, and "the Lord God will wipe away tears from <lb/>
off all faces"?</p>

<q>"What a happiness work is!&mdash;there is nothing so satisfactory as <lb/>
having an object in life."</q>
<bibl><author><hi rend="small-caps">Lady Henry Somerset</hi>.</author></bibl>
</cit>
</epigraph>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">There</hi> is a latent spark of chivalry in the human <lb/>
breast, which is easily kindled into a generous <lb/>
flame at the recital of some noble deed. Altruism is the <lb/>
favourite virtue of the age, the culture of the social science <lb/>
its favourite study, and, however we may define it&mdash;as <lb/>
utilitarianism, philanthropy, universal benevolence, or even <lb/>
humanitarianism&mdash;the meaning is clear and distinct, the love <lb/>
of our brethren brought into action.</p>
<p>In the dark ages, when the world was younger and faith <lb/>
stronger and more childlike, the Christian knight-errant, <lb/>
sworn liegeman of the Cross, left home and wife and children, <lb/>
to fight and bleed, and maybe die, on the hallowed ground <lb/>
where the Saviour's feet had trod among the lilies of Syria. <lb/>
To deliver the Holy City and the sacred cave of Sepulchre, <lb/>
out of the hands of the Infidels, that was the object of the <lb/>
Crusades, and for which thousands of warriors laid down <lb/>
their lives.</p>
<p>To the modern practical mind there was something <lb/>
fantastic in the medi&aelig;val campaign, the task was impossible; <lb/>
and yet as we stand beside some monument where some <lb/>
stony warrior lies with clasped hands and the cross upon his <lb/>
mailed breast, we feel a sudden thrill, a hushed reverence, as <lb/>
though we were on Holy ground. Rough soldier, unlettered, <lb/>
uncultured, he may have been, but he had fought his good <lb/>
<pb n="334" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0365"/>
fight; his youth, and perhaps the best of his life had been <lb/>
spent in warfare against the Saracens, and he had come back <lb/>
to die amongst his own people. But it is not only the <lb/>
deeds of old chivalry that move us to admiration: even in <lb/>
this nineteenth century there are noble crusades being <lb/>
organized and led by many a faithful soul against the hordes <lb/>
of evil.</p>
<p>Civilisation has done much, thank God, to humanise <lb/>
mankind; but there are still dark corners of the earth, where <lb/>
the enemy is entrenched, where might, not right prevails, <lb/>
and the souls of the righteous are vexed, as Lot's was in the <lb/>
God-forsaken Cities of the Plain, by the corruption and evil <lb/>
and cruelty that surround them. The maleficent spirits <lb/>
are Legion; but of all the powers of darkness, the <reg orig="hydra-|headed">hydra-headed</reg> <lb/>
monster of Intemperance is one of the most baneful <lb/>
and powerful.</p>
<p>It is the sin of England&mdash;how often we have heard that <lb/>
said. The phrase is hackneyed, we say it glibly almost <reg orig="with-|out">without</reg> <lb/>
realising its meaning, but how awfully true it is! The <lb/>
sin of merrie England&mdash;the great festering sore that breeds <lb/>
corruption, that brings misery to thousands of innocent <lb/>
beings; yet who can doubt it, who walks with seeing eyes <lb/>
through the streets and alleys of our vast metropolis? The <lb/>
myriad gin palaces, with their flaming gaslights and <lb/>
steamy vitiated atmosphere, the drink-sodden men reeling <lb/>
out of the swing door, the tawdry miserable women, the <lb/>
white-faced starvelings of children&mdash;among all the awful <lb/>
problems that brave men and women are striving to solve, <lb/>
surely this is the saddest question of all, how is the Drink <lb/>
Fiend to be met and vanquished?</p>
<p>God's workers are many, and each has his or her <lb/>
corner of the vineyard and their own special work to <lb/>
do. The great problem of the submerged is engaging their <lb/>
attention, "the labour question, sweating, the <reg orig="tenement-|house">tenementhouse</reg> <lb/>
system, the social evil, woman's suffrage, all branches <lb/>
<pb n="335" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0366"/>
of the same subject," to which they are devoting their best <lb/>
energies; and amongst them no name is more prominent <lb/>
or held in higher honour than the subject of this sketch, <lb/>
Lady Henry Somerset, who has consecrated her splendid <lb/>
talents and strong powers of mind and body to the <reg orig="temper-|ance">temperance</reg> <lb/>
work. "To be good rather than to be admired," and <lb/>
"I scorn to turn or to be afraid," are the mottoes of the <lb/>
Houses of Somers and Beaufort, and no one who has <lb/>
studied the accounts of Lady Henry Somerset's great <lb/>
work can doubt that she has nobly lived up to these <lb/>
mottoes.</p>
<p>Lady Henry Somerset is one of the two wealthiest <lb/>
heiresses in England. She is the eldest daughter and <lb/>
heiress of Earl Somers, and her ancestral home, Eastnor <lb/>
Castle, is only outranked in splendour by Chatsworth and <lb/>
Warwick. Her only sister is Adeline, the lately widowed <lb/>
Duchess of Bedford, and her son and only child, the Hon. <lb/>
Henry Charles Somerset is the prospective heir to the <lb/>
Dukedom of Beaufort, descending in a direct line from the <lb/>
Plantagenets.</p>
<p>In Macaulay's "History of England" there is an <reg orig="interest-|ing">interesting</reg> <lb/>
record of her great ancestor, Lord Keeper Somers, Chief <lb/>
Counsellor of William the Third, "of whom it is said that he <lb/>
excelled alike in literature and statesmanship," and who was <lb/>
mainly instrumental in securing the Protestant succession. <lb/>
He was the friend of Joseph Addison, Richard Steele. <lb/>
Congreve and other English writers.</p>
<p>Lady Henry's father, Lord Somers, was one of the finest <lb/>
art critics in England, a pupil of Frederick Maurice and a <lb/>
friend of Ruskin and Turner. "It was through his efforts <lb/>
that Sir Henry Layard was enabled to make the famous <lb/>
excavations at Nineveh, the results of which are a marked <lb/>
feature of the British Museum. Lord Somers was the <lb/>
friend of Cavour and Garibaldi, and had the cause of <lb/>
Italian unity deeply at heart."</p>
<pb n="336" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0367"/>
<p>There is French blood in Lady Henry Somerset's veins, <lb/>
for her mother was the beautiful Miss Pattle, grand-daughter <lb/>
of Madame de L'Etang, who was maid-of-honour to the <lb/>
ill-fated Marie Antoinette.</p>
<p>The two sisters, we are told, were most carefully educated; <lb/>
but, owing to the frequent residence of their parents abroad, <lb/>
they were left in the charge of relatives who were perhaps a <lb/>
little over-anxious and scrupulous. There is an amusing <lb/>
speech narrated by Mrs. Tooley. When Lady Isabel was <lb/>
only five years old, she astonished her father's friend, Sir <lb/>
Henry Layard, by telling him in effect that her life was <lb/>
scarcely worth living, because she had "too many parents."</p>
<p>But, in spite of "her twenty governesses," she grew up a <lb/>
bright, natural child, fond of out-of-door life, and with a fund <lb/>
of humour and spirits.</p>
<p>In 1873 Lady Isabel Somers married Lord Henry <lb/>
Somerset, the second son of the Duke of Beaufort. The <lb/>
death of her father, Earl Somers, made her the mistress of <lb/>
a splendid heritage. An American paper tells us "that <lb/>
Eastnor Castle is surrounded by twenty-five thousand acres <lb/>
of land," and that "one hundred and twenty-five thousand <lb/>
people live on the property which she owns in the city of <lb/>
London." In addition to this, she is the owner of large <lb/>
property at Reigate, where she has another beautiful <lb/>
home called "The Priory." Until the year 1885 Lady <lb/>
Henry Somerset lived the ordinary society life; to outward <lb/>
seeming she was only a gay, fashionable woman; but <lb/>
even then there was an unsatisfied void. Her mind craved <lb/>
for higher things, and declined to be fed solely on the <lb/>
husks offered her. Her own words were: "Though I was <lb/>
living in society, and had enough to do to keep my head <lb/>
above water, and though I was a woman of the world, I have <lb/>
never been a worldly woman. I never saw the day that I <lb/>
would not gladly have left parks and palaces for fields and <lb/>
woods."</p>
<pb n="337" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0368"/>
<p>God's chosen workers have their special call and training. <lb/>
We read again and again, how some great thinker or reformer, <lb/>
destined to become a leader among men or women, has <lb/>
served a long, weary apprenticeship, or have had to prove <lb/>
their faith, like the Jewish youths of old, in the fiery furnace <lb/>
of affliction.</p>
<p>In common with most strong, vigorous natures, Lady <lb/>
Henry had her secret difficulties and doubts. Her mind <lb/>
was naturally analytic and critical. But one June day, <lb/>
when seated under the great elm on the lawn at Reigate, <lb/>
the voice which our first parents heard in the garden of <lb/>
Eden seemed to speak to her inner consciousness. This <lb/>
solemn and sacred experience is narrated in simple and <lb/>
touching language by her friend, Miss Frances Willard. <lb/>
"Lady Henry Somerset," she writes, "seemed to hear <lb/>
a voice in the depths of her soul, and it said, 'My child, <lb/>
act as if I were, and thou shalt know I am.'" She had <lb/>
never before been conscious of anything so clear, so true, <lb/>
as this voice of God speaking to her inmost spirit. She <lb/>
wondered, and was glad. Rising from the rustic seat where <lb/>
all alone she had been pondering on the mysteries of being, <lb/>
she walked over to her pretty rose-garden near by, and <lb/>
stood there in the sunset enjoying the fragrance and quiet <lb/>
of the place and the purity of the open sky, while still the <lb/>
voice sounded in her heart.&hellip;" What follows is almost too <lb/>
sacred for repetition. It was the crisis of her life, and, <lb/>
like Paul of Tarsus, she "was not disobedient to the heavenly <lb/>
vision."</p>
<p>Her summer plans of gaiety and travel were given up, <lb/>
and a few days later she went with her son to Eastnor <lb/>
Castle, where she remained quietly for some years, studying <lb/>
the Scriptures and working amongst her tenantry. Here, <lb/>
amongst her own people, she brought up her boy, and <lb/>
served her apprenticeship to philanthropic reform. <reg orig="Philan-|thropy">Philanthropy</reg> <lb/>
was not wholly unknown to her, as Mrs. Tooley <lb/>
<pb n="338" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0369"/>
tells us in her interesting article: "Even in her society <lb/>
days, when slumming was not fashionable as it now is, she <lb/>
was occasionally to be found in the homes of the poor and <lb/>
distressed, and did not think it beneath her dignity to light <lb/>
a fire with her own hands on the empty hearth of a poor <lb/>
woman in a London slum, prompted then by the same <lb/>
feeling of human compassion which led her, only a few <lb/>
weeks ago, to seek permission to pass the night in a <reg orig="police-|cell">police-cell</reg>, <lb/>
so that she might by experience realise the sad <reg orig="treat-|ment">treatment</reg> <lb/>
to which female prisoners are subjected, and use the <lb/>
knowledge for the redress of their wrongs."</p>
<p>Perhaps no woman of this age has ever been more richly <lb/>
gifted by nature than the mistress of Eastnor Castle. She <lb/>
has not only been endowed with beauty, charm of manner, <lb/>
and talents of a high order, but her voice combines <reg orig="sweet-|ness">sweetness</reg> <lb/>
with remarkable power. It is said that she can be <lb/>
heard by every listener in audiences of ten and twelve <lb/>
thousand people. When her faithful friend, Miss Willard, <lb/>
was once asked whom she considered the greatest woman <lb/>
of the day, she replied with enthusiasm: "Lady Henry <lb/>
Somerset. She possesses the most eloquent tongue, the <lb/>
mellowest heart, the widest outlook, the readiest hands, and <lb/>
the finest setting of any woman living. She is so attempered <lb/>
by sorrow, so annealed by pain, that she has become as <lb/>
ductile as the noble metals. She is great as a statesman <lb/>
and as an administrator. Some excel in one line, some in <lb/>
two, but she is strong in all." A magnificent eulogy, surely, <lb/>
but uttered from the depth of the heart of one who was her <lb/>
chosen friend.</p>
<p>Lady Henry Somerset's attention was soon called to the <lb/>
fact that intemperance was the greatest curse of the estates <lb/>
of which she was mistress. She held her first temperance <lb/>
meeting and gave her first address in the schoolroom she <lb/>
had established near the Castle gate, and there signed the <lb/>
pledge, her example being followed by about forty others. <lb/>
<pb n="339" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0370"/>
"From this time," we are told, "she went on, giving <reg orig="Bible-|readings">Bible-readings</reg> <lb/>
in the kitchen of a farmhouse near the Castle, <lb/>
building mission-rooms, employing evangelists and <reg orig="Bible-|readers">Bible-readers</reg>, <lb/>
and speaking at the religious and temperance <lb/>
meetings of the village constantly herself.&hellip; Soon the <lb/>
knowledge of the change that had come over her life led to <lb/>
her being invited to the villages and towns round about, <lb/>
until she has visited and worked in no fewer than two <lb/>
hundred villages and cities of Great Britain." So the <lb/>
temperance crusade was started, and little by little from <lb/>
cottage meetings she advanced to the front rank of women <lb/>
orators, now addressing large audiences in crowded halls now <lb/>
talking to Welsh colliers in the murky darkness of the pits <lb/>
as they rested during the dinner-hour. Her fame as a <lb/>
speaker on temperance reform soon spread through the <lb/>
country, and in 1890 Lady Henry Somerset was invited to <lb/>
become the President of the British Women's Temperance <lb/>
Association, in which position she succeeded Mrs. Bright <lb/>
Lucas, the sister of John Bright. About a year and a half <lb/>
after this Lady Henry visited America by invitation of the <lb/>
National W.C.T.U. She was accompanied by Mrs. Pearsall <lb/>
Smith, author of "The Christian's Secret of a Happy Life." <lb/>
They attended the convention of the World's Woman's <lb/>
Christian Temperance Union, held that year in Boston, <lb/>
"representing through its delegates more than ten thousand <lb/>
local societies and half a million women from all parts of <lb/>
Christendom."</p>
<p>Lady Henry Somerset received an enthusiastic ovation. <lb/>
"It is asserted that her welcome in the West was heartier <lb/>
than that bestowed upon any foreign visitor since Lafayette." <lb/>
She was made vice-president, and her fame as a speaker <lb/>
was so great that the street outside would be packed with <lb/>
people who could not find entrance in the crowded hall. <lb/>
Her meetings in Chicago, Baltimore, Philadelphia, and <lb/>
Washington have been memorable in the history of the <lb/>
<pb n="340" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0371"/>
W.C.T.U. One of her objects in crossing the Atlantic was <lb/>
to find out Frances Willard, whose book, "Nineteen <lb/>
Beautiful Years," had influenced her greatly. This was <lb/>
the commencement of a deep friendship between them. <lb/>
It was during this visit that Lady Henry Somerset made <lb/>
acquaintance with Oliver Wendell Holmes and John <lb/>
Greenleaf Whittier, and if it had not been for the pressure <lb/>
of work she would have passed a delightful winter.</p>
<p>On her return to England in 1892 Lady Henry took <lb/>
part in the Liberal election campaign; and it may give <lb/>
some idea of her work to know that she gave thirty-six <lb/>
addresses in fourteen days. In the autumn of this year <lb/>
she again went to America, visiting Denver, Colorado, and <lb/>
joining in the annual meeting of the National Woman's <lb/>
Christian Temperance Union. On her return home Lady <lb/>
Henry threw herself into her Temperance work with <reg orig="re-|newed">renewed</reg> <lb/>
energy and vigour. Mrs. Tooley tells us in her <lb/>
sketch, that "in England alone she has travelled nearly <lb/>
fifteen thousand miles, addressing vast audiences." Small <lb/>
wonder that one energetic worker exclaimed, "Things are <lb/>
really getting serious; something must be done to restrain <lb/>
Lady Henry. She will kill herself if she continues to work <lb/>
at this rate." And indeed, later on, the zealous worker <lb/>
suffered acutely from nervous overstrain. At one time we <lb/>
read that a slight friction was caused by Lady Henry <lb/>
wishing to embrace other social questions which she rightly <lb/>
considered were involved in the Temperance question, such <lb/>
as Women's Suffrage and the Purity Movement; but there <lb/>
is no doubt that her womanly sympathies and clear-sighted <lb/>
common-sense made her widen her outlook, and "being a <lb/>
woman of remarkable executive ability and true <reg orig="statesman-|like">statesmanlike</reg> <lb/>
qualities," she took her stand boldly and without <lb/>
flinching.</p>
<p>She was a temperance woman before she took the white <lb/>
ribbon. Now we read "that there is hardly a city or town <lb/>
<pb n="341" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0372"/>
in England that has not heard her earnest voice pleading <lb/>
for total abstinence." But it is not only as a platform <lb/>
speaker that Lady Henry Somerset is so widely known. <lb/>
Her editorial work presents her under another aspect.</p>
<p>In Chicago she had worked for some time as sub-editor <lb/>
of the <hi rend="italic">Union Signal</hi>, edited by Miss Willard. In this way <lb/>
she gained some practical knowledge of journalistic work.</p>
<p>Afterwards she started the <hi rend="italic">Woman's Signal</hi>, feeling there <lb/>
was a crying need for a paper that should educate women <lb/>
on advanced lines; to quote her own words, "a paper <lb/>
which would interest and instruct the women in the home, <lb/>
and show them something of the movements regarding the <lb/>
uplifting of their sex which are afloat to-day. 'For God, <lb/>
for home, and every land' is our motto, you know." And <lb/>
again: "We take our stand by the side of Temperance <lb/>
and Social Reforms, the Purity Movement, and Woman's <lb/>
Franchise." There is no doubt that Lady Henry Somerset <lb/>
enjoyed her editorial work. In 1894 she informed her <lb/>
interviewer that "her articles were nearly always written in <lb/>
the train, and that she prepared her speeches also when <lb/>
she was travelling."</p>
<p>Her untiring energy as a worker is marvellous. In an <lb/>
article written by Miss Willard for the <hi rend="italic">Young Woman</hi>, in <lb/>
1893, there is an interesting sketch of Lady Henry Somerset <lb/>
at home.</p>
<p>"Reigate is but one of her places of residence," she <lb/>
writes, "and when there she lives for the present mostly at <lb/>
'the Cottage,' as it is called&mdash;a tasteful modern house at <lb/>
a little distance from the sunshiny old Priory, which is <lb/>
now undergoing alterations and repairs. If you see her <lb/>
at her home in London, you will find her surrounded by <lb/>
stenographers, secretaries, interviewers, committees, writing <lb/>
letters by the hundred, receiving telegrams more <reg orig="fre-|quently">frequently</reg> <lb/>
than almost any one gets letters, and going out <lb/>
to engagements, nearly every one of them relating to <lb/>
<pb n="342" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0373"/>
philanthropy. The next you know she is taking the train <lb/>
for her long lecture trips, standing at night before audiences <lb/>
that almost invariably number from two to five thousand, <lb/>
and holding on the morning after, a conference often <reg orig="repre-|senting">representing</reg> <lb/>
all the organised philanthropies of the city she is <lb/>
visiting."</p>
<p>This spirited sketch, written in 1893, has been <reg orig="cor-|roborated">corroborated</reg> <lb/>
by another writer this year in the following <lb/>
paragraph:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Rising early and toiling late, Lady Henry sits all day <lb/>
long with stenographers, except when in public life. On <lb/>
the tram, in the train, she labours busily, and has immense <lb/>
facility of concentration, so that she can give out letters, <lb/>
articles, and speeches with marvellous rapidity."</p>
<p>It is at Duxhurst, near Reigate, where Lady Henry <lb/>
Somerset's noblest work is being carried on, and where <lb/>
for the last four years she and a band of sisters and teachers <lb/>
have laboured devotedly amongst hundreds of women who <lb/>
have been victims of drunkenness. "The nucleus of the <lb/>
idea was the Home Lady Henry had long maintained at <lb/>
Reigate for otherwise unmanageable orphan girls, taking <lb/>
over often the ne'er-do-wells of the workhouse, and turning <lb/>
them out well-trained laundry-maids and domestic servants."</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Churchwoman</hi>, in the February number of this year, <lb/>
gives a most interesting account of the work at Duxhurst, <lb/>
under the touching title "A Refuge and a Covert from <lb/>
the Storm." The results have been so satisfactory, even in <lb/>
these four years, that, as the writer of the article remarks, <lb/>
"no more can it be said, as has often been said before, <lb/>
that it is absolutely hopeless to reclaim a woman who has <lb/>
once become addicted to drink."</p>
<p>It is now fully recognised that drunkenness is not only <lb/>
a moral, but a physical disease, and requires special <reg orig="treat-|ment">treatment</reg>. <lb/>
In the old days, when the miserable victims were <lb/>
sent to prison, one heard of cases in which the prisoner was <lb/>
<pb n="343" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0374"/>
convicted for the hundredth, or even the three-hundredth, <lb/>
time. Alas! for the confirmed drunkard no prison discipline <lb/>
is a deterrent. Lady Henry Somerset's clear brain had <lb/>
grasped this fact, and she strongly felt the need of providing <lb/>
Inebriate Homes, not "run on old-fashioned penitentiary <lb/>
lines," with any idea of punishment, but as veritable Homes. <lb/>
The description of this ideal retreat, which is really an <lb/>
industrial farm colony, should be given in the founder's <lb/>
own words, as narrated in the <hi rend="italic">Churchwoman</hi>. "It consists," <lb/>
Lady Henry Somerset tells us, "of a colony village, built <lb/>
on the slopes of the hills of Surrey&mdash;a breezy upland farm <lb/>
overlooking beautiful plains that stretch away for miles on <lb/>
either side. The strong, bracing air and lovely woods have <lb/>
lent themselves as the best possible surroundings for our <lb/>
settlement. Here the little thatched cottages, bright and <lb/>
smiling, nestle as though they had been built for many a <lb/>
year, forming a triangle round the green, while on one side <lb/>
stands the hospital, and opposite the church and in another <lb/>
meadow the long building called 'The Children's Nest' <lb/>
faces the village. Far up the road, in its own grounds, is <lb/>
the Manor House, which has been opened for the reception <lb/>
of patients able to pay a larger fee." Each cottage contains <lb/>
six inhabitants and a nurse sister, who superintends the <lb/>
small household. The cottages are furnished simply, and <lb/>
the women take a pride and interest in their home.</p>
<p>They have plenty of wholesome occupation, so one paper <lb/>
tells us, in "out-of-door work on the lawns, among the <lb/>
flower-beds, in the vegetable gardens and the <reg orig="forcing-|houses.&hellip;">forcinghouses.&hellip;</reg> <lb/>
Early tomatoes and cucumbers are grown for <lb/>
the market. All the vegetables for the colony are grown <lb/>
by the women themselves. There is also bee-farming and <lb/>
silk-weaving. Hard work, but at the same time work that <lb/>
is varied and interesting, is recognised as part of the <reg orig="treat-|ment">treatment</reg>; <lb/>
and, as the <hi rend="italic">Churchwoman</hi> sensibly observes, "with <lb/>
their minds healthily occupied, and their lungs filled with <lb/>
<pb n="344" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0375"/>
sweet fresh air, it is not astonishing that women who come <lb/>
to the colony utter wrecks, soon regain their youth, a <lb/>
happy, bright look, and, in many cases, strength for the <lb/>
rest of their lives to resist the temptation which has been <lb/>
their ruin."</p>
<p>The work in the garden is superintended by Miss Jessie <lb/>
Smith, a lady gardener trained at Swanley. The women <lb/>
mow the lawns with light hand-mowing machines; there <lb/>
are eight bee-hives, and one woman has worked each <lb/>
summer among the bees. As some of the patients are not <lb/>
fit for out-of-door work, other industries have been started. <lb/>
In March last year there was only one loom; now there <lb/>
are three. On these the women weave fancy aprons, dress <lb/>
materials, etc., while the knitting machine is also used for <lb/>
numerous warm articles. Laundry-work and mending is <lb/>
also done, and yet, with all this, it is grievous to read that <lb/>
this colony is still in debt. This is a sad burden on the <lb/>
founder's mind.</p>
<p>The Holiday Home for Children, "the Bird's Nest," is <lb/>
a great interest to the women. In the summer children <lb/>
are taken from the slums for a fortnight's holiday, to enjoy <lb/>
the sweet sights and sounds of the country. Lady Henry <lb/>
Somerset's idea of grouping the patients is recognised as an <lb/>
excellent one; and one paper tells us, "that in her recent <lb/>
address at the Mansion House she told how a new inmate <lb/>
forgot her sorrows in discussing the respective merits of the <lb/>
kitchen range in the cottage and that which had adorned <lb/>
her own kitchen."</p>
<p>There are many touching letters written to the Sisters <lb/>
by the women after they have left, which bear testimony to <lb/>
good work done; and sometimes former patients bring down <lb/>
their friends at their own expense, and beg for their <reg orig="admit-|tance">admittance</reg>. <lb/>
There is one very pathetic story told in the <hi rend="italic">Woman's <lb/>
Weekly</hi>: "One day a prayer-meeting was being held, when <lb/>
suddenly the door opened, and a girl, one of the former <lb/>
<pb n="345" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0376"/>
inmates slipped in, and fetched out one of the matrons <lb/>
and Lady Henry Somerset, who happened to be present. <lb/>
Knowing the girl to be living in Manchester, they were <lb/>
somewhat alarmed; but this was what she said: 'Oh, <lb/>
ma'am, I have brought you my mistress. I knew what a lot <lb/>
of good you did me, and I saved up all my money, and paid <lb/>
her fare, and here she is!' Could any testimony be more <lb/>
touching than the generosity of this poor servant-girl, who <lb/>
loved much because her sins had been forgiven her?"</p>
<p>The statistics furnished by Lady Henry Somerset to one <lb/>
of her interviewers are full of interest. She mentioned that <lb/>
up to the present date, last May, the colony had received <lb/>
112 inmates; "55 were successful, 9 failed after staying the <lb/>
full year, 5 were removed by friends before that period had <lb/>
elapsed, 6 were removed by the medical officer as unfit for <lb/>
medical treatment, 5 absconded, 3 were sent away as <reg orig="in-|corrigible">incorrigible</reg>, <lb/>
3 died, 2 were insane, and 1 is doubtful." Sad, <lb/>
indeed, is the story of these patients, as Lady Henry gives <lb/>
it in her concise, businesslike way. "Of these," she tells <lb/>
us, "84 were married women, 28 were single, 43 had <lb/>
inebriate family history, 8 had insanity in the family, 11 <lb/>
had ancestors who died of paralysis, 63 were habitual <lb/>
drunkards, 40 periodical drunkards, and 7 were secret <lb/>
drunkards.&hellip;" In stating the cause of their fall, 34 gave <lb/>
depressing nervous work or trouble, 22 companionship, <lb/>
8 overwork, 6 cruelty.</p>
<p>One of the strangest and most terrible of the life-stories <lb/>
that came under Lady Henry's notice is that of Jane <lb/>
Cakebread, who had been imprisoned nearly three hundred <lb/>
times. This unfortunate woman had drifted between the <lb/>
street and prison for many years, and had finally been sent <lb/>
away from Duxhurst, not for drunkenness, but for an attack <lb/>
on another woman. It was found out that she was mentally <lb/>
deranged, and had fits of violence even when she was <lb/>
sober; the medical officer was convinced of her insanity, <lb/>
<pb n="346" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0377"/>
and she was finally sent to Claybury, where she ended her <lb/>
days.</p>
<p>Jane Cakebread was not the only woman who had been <lb/>
sent to prison nearly three hundred times; another poor <lb/>
creature with a similar reputation came to the haven of rest <lb/>
at Duxhurst. She was said to be one of the most <reg orig="un-|manageable">unmanageable</reg> <lb/>
women in Holloway gaol, but when sober she <lb/>
was docile and affectionate. She remained in the colony <lb/>
for a year, but her health was impaired by intemperance <lb/>
and constant imprisonment. When she left she remained <lb/>
sober, in spite of her sufferings, till she died six months <lb/>
later. "A little tablet," observed Lady Henry, "is now <lb/>
erected in our church to her memory, with the words, 'At <lb/>
evening time it shall be light'; and we are happy in the <lb/>
knowledge that this poor stricken wayfarer saw that great <lb/>
Light before she entered into the new hope that lay for her <lb/>
beyond."</p>
<p>Such is the work to which Lady Henry Somerset is <lb/>
devoting her splendid talents, for she is as gifted with her <lb/>
pen as with her voice. She goes a great deal amongst her <lb/>
tenantry, and has built a chapel, reading-room, and restaurant <lb/>
for her London tenants. "Lady Henry Somerset is a whole <lb/>
fresh-air mission in herself," was the verdict of one whom <lb/>
she helped. She holds her own strong views on many <lb/>
subjects. "Justice to Ireland, the better housing of the <lb/>
poor, the provision of old age pensions, and the harmonising <lb/>
of reformatory institutions," are matters in which she takes <lb/>
a keen interest.</p>
<p>"All must do something," exclaims this zealous worker, <lb/>
"for every soul is precious, and if, in the brief space of life, <lb/>
we restore to some poor soul some glimpse of the innocence <lb/>
they once enjoyed, some closer communion with the Light <lb/>
that lighteneth every man that cometh into the world, we <lb/>
shall not have hoped and laboured in vain."</p>
<p>Grand words, that we all should do well to lay to heart! <lb/>
<pb n="347" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0378"/>
May other Englishwomen be incited by them to follow <lb/>
Lady Henry Somerset's noble example, and by their life, <lb/>
their influence, and the dedication of their talents, to fight <lb/>
against the crying social evils of the day.</p>
<p>God will surely bless such work and such workers; and <lb/>
when life's long day is ended, and the labourers are called <lb/>
into the Master's presence, they will not appear before <lb/>
Him empty-handed, but shall have some precious sheaves <lb/>
to lay at their Lord's feet.</p>

<p>"<hi rend="small-caps">Few</hi> things have a more salutary effect upon me <lb/>
than reading secular biographies. For, successful <lb/>
or unsuccessful alike, 'vanity of vanities' seems the truest <lb/>
characteristic of every life not devoted to the very highest <lb/>
aims. 'Queens of Society,' Autobiography of Louis Spohr, <lb/>
and others, have left this feeling strongly upon me, and <lb/>
have been auxiliary in making me wish that my life may <lb/>
be laid out for Him whose it is by right. Oh, that he may <lb/>
make me a vessel sanctified and meet for the Master's <lb/>
use!" These words were written by the subject of this <lb/>
sketch in the record of her inner life, and bore testimony <lb/>
to the singleness of her aim.</p>
<p>Consecration, self-surrender, is the keynote to Frances <lb/>
Ridley Havergal's life; and as we read the loving <lb/>
"Memorials," penned by a sister's hand, we seem lifted up <lb/>
into higher regions, where the atmosphere is pure and the <lb/>
mountain tops are bathed in the golden light of heaven.</p>
<p>To those who are of the earth earthy, who prefer the <lb/>
<pb n="352" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0385"/>
glitter and tinsel of Vanity Fair to the Delectable Mountains <lb/>
or the fair pasturage of the Land of Beulah, a life like <lb/>
Frances Havergal's is simply an unintelligible problem, <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">terra incognita</hi>, a sealed book full of unsolved mystery, <lb/>
the very language in which it is written is unknown to <lb/>
them, it is a cipher to which they have no key.</p>
<p>How are such light natures to sound "the strange <lb/>
soul-depths, restless, vast and broad, unfathomed as the <lb/>
sea," with their puny-sounding rods? Under the surface <lb/>
there may be depths and wonderful abysses, an unseen <lb/>
world of moving life, strong currents, warm gulf-streams, <lb/>
of which they have no knowledge. Like Gallio of old, <lb/>
Worldly Wiseman "cares for none of these things"; they <lb/>
are foolishness to him. Bunyan's quaint fable of the <reg orig="muck-|rake">muckrake</reg> <lb/>
and the angel with the celestial crown embodies this <lb/>
idea; for as the Interpreter remarks: "'And whereas thou <lb/>
seest him rather give heed to rake up straws and sticks, <lb/>
and the dust of the floor, than to what He says that calls <lb/>
to him from above, with the celestial crown in His hand; <lb/>
it is to show that heaven is but a fable to some, and that <lb/>
things here are counted the only things substantial.&hellip;' <lb/>
Then said Christiana: 'Oh, deliver me from this muck-rake.' <lb/>
'That prayer,' said the Interpreter, 'has lain by till it is <lb/>
almost rusty. "Give me not riches" is scarce the prayer <lb/>
of one of ten thousand. Straws and sticks and dust, with <lb/>
most, are the great things now looked after.'"</p>
<p>But if "whole-hearted loyalty in the Master's service" <lb/>
be the keynote of Frances Havergal's life, as we have <lb/>
before remarked, there is another salient point that especially <lb/>
attracts our notice, and that is, how her splendid gifts and <lb/>
sweet service of song were neutralised and silenced for <lb/>
months together by ill-health.</p>
<p>"&hellip; I am stopped in every attempt at consecutive <lb/>
work," she once wrote to a friend. "It has for years been <lb/>
special discipline to me, because I am naturally fond of <lb/>
<pb n="353" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0386"/>
going through with a thing, and have always had a strong <lb/>
yearning for definite, settled work. Yet I have never been <lb/>
permitted anything but desultory work; either ailments <lb/>
or something beyond my own control has always interfered, <lb/>
ever since I was about twenty." There is a sad ring in <lb/>
these words, as though the dark edge of the cloud were, <lb/>
turned to her. But later she wrote more brightly: "The <lb/>
bits of wayside work are very sweet. Perhaps the <hi rend="italic">odd</hi> bits <lb/>
when all is done, will really come to more than the seeming <lb/>
greater pieces! The chance conversations with rich or <lb/>
poor, the seed sown in odd five minutes, even the <lb/>
<foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italic">tables-d'h&ocirc;te</hi></foreign> for me, and the rides and friends' tables for <lb/>
you." There were many "turned lessons" in Frances <lb/>
Havergal's life; but, as she herself so sweetly says:&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"Was it not kinder the task to turn,</l>
<l rend="indent">Than to let it pass,</l>
<l>As a lost, lost leaf that she did not learn?"</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>Frances Ridley Havergal was born on December 14th, <lb/>
1836. She was the youngest of the family; there were <lb/>
two brothers and three sisters older than herself. Her <lb/>
father was then the rector of Astley, Worcestershire, and <lb/>
she was baptised in Astley church. Her sponsors were <lb/>
Miss Lucy Emra, authoress of "Lawrence the Martyr," <lb/>
and other poems; Miss Elizabeth Coward and the Rev. <lb/>
W. H. Ridley, rector of Hambleden. Frances loved her <lb/>
name of Ridley, and was proud to be the descendant of <lb/>
the martyred bishop. There is a very interesting extract <lb/>
from a letter written by the Rev. F. H. Jeffery, afterwards <lb/>
vicar of Sway, then curate at Astley, quoted in the <lb/>
Memorials, which gives a charming description of the little <lb/>
Frances.</p>
<p>"I well remember Astley Rectory," he writes, "more <lb/>
than forty years ago. At that time your sister Frances was <lb/>
rather more than two years old; a very fairy-like creature. <lb/>
<pb n="354" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0387"/>
Her chief companion was then a white-and-tan spaniel, such <lb/>
as Landseer might have loved, and this little favourite she <lb/>
called Flora or Flo. At morning prayers she always sat on <lb/>
her father's knee while he read the Scriptures. It is likely <lb/>
that she learned to read as a mere pastime. I well <lb/>
remember her sweet infant voice singing little hymns in <lb/>
imitation of her father.&hellip; The day she was four years old <lb/>
her little maid brought her down after dinner to dessert, <lb/>
crowned with a wreath of bay leaves. I shall never forget <lb/>
the picture she was&mdash;her dear mother in miniature, <lb/>
especially in the brightness of her expression and the <lb/>
sparkle of her eye."</p>
<p>Even at that early age her precocity was surprising. At <lb/>
four years old Frances could read the Bible and any <lb/>
ordinary book, and could write in round hand. French <lb/>
and music were gradually imparted, but she never had a <lb/>
regular governess. There can be little doubt that Frances <lb/>
inherited her love of music from her father. At this time <lb/>
he was an invalid, and he solaced himself by composing <lb/>
cathedral services, and many hundreds of chants and tunes, <lb/>
and some sacred songs; the profits accruing from these <lb/>
compositions were devoted to various societies and the <lb/>
restoration of churches.</p>
<p>In 1844 the living of Astley was resigned, and Henwick <lb/>
House, in the parish of Hallow, became the home of the <lb/>
Havergal family, until Bishop Pepys appointed their father <lb/>
to the rectory of St. Nicholas, Worcester, in 1845. <lb/>
Frances' first childish grief was the death of her playmate <lb/>
Flo. The little creature was buried under the Mespilus tree <lb/>
on the back lawn. Her childish memorandum is still <lb/>
preserved: "Here lies little Flora. Died April 16th, 1844, <lb/>
aged seven. Reverence her remains."</p>
<p>Frances showed a thirst for knowledge from a very early <lb/>
age. She always contrived to be in the drawing-room when <lb/>
the German professor was giving his lesson. In this way <lb/>
<pb n="355" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0388"/>
she acquired the language. "When discovered," remarked <lb/>
a sister, "she had made such progress that Mr. Lorentz <lb/>
begged that he might instruct her."</p>
<p>When she was nine she wrote descriptive letters in perfect <lb/>
rhyme and rhythm to her brother Frank and her young <lb/>
friends. When Frances Havergal was two-and-twenty she <lb/>
wrote an autobiographical sketch of her childhood and <lb/>
school life. In it she remarks: "Up to the time that I was <lb/>
six years old I have no remembrance of religious ideas <reg orig="what-|ever">whatever</reg>. <lb/>
But from six to eight I recall a different state of <lb/>
things. The beginning of it was a sermon preached one <lb/>
Sunday morning at Hallow church by Mr. &lpar;now Archdeacon&rpar; <lb/>
Phillpotts. Of this I even now retain a distinct impression." <lb/>
Then in a na&iuml;ve way she adds: "I began to pray a good <lb/>
deal, though only night and morning, with a sort of fidget <lb/>
and impatience, almost angry at feeling so unhappy, and <lb/>
wanting and expecting to get a new heart and have <reg orig="every-|thing">everything</reg> <lb/>
put straight and be made happy all at once&hellip;." <lb/>
And then she goes on: "I shall know some day <hi rend="italic">why</hi> my <lb/>
Father left me to walk thus alone in my early childhood, <lb/>
why such long years of dissatisfaction and restlessness <lb/>
were apportioned me, while others fancied me a happy, <lb/>
thoughtless child."</p>
<p>When Frances was eleven years old she had the grief of <lb/>
losing her beloved mother. She felt her loss acutely, <lb/>
though she did not always show it. "If anything <reg orig="occu-|pied">occupied</reg> <lb/>
my attention," she wrote, "I had a happy faculty <lb/>
of forgetting everything else for the moment. And thus it <lb/>
happened that a merry laugh, or a sudden light-heeled <lb/>
scamper down stairs, led others to think I had not many <lb/>
sad thoughts, whereas not a minute before my little heart <lb/>
was heavy and sad."</p>
<p>It was a consciousness of this trait that made her write <lb/>
later: "Among the best gifts of God to me, I count a <lb/>
certain stormy-petrelism of nature, which seems to enable <lb/>
<pb n="356" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0389"/>
me to skim any waves when I am not actually under them. <lb/>
I have an elasticity which often makes me wonder at myself, <lb/>
a power of throwing myself into any present interest or <lb/>
enjoyment, though the sorrow is only suspended, not <lb/>
removed."</p>
<p>After this sorrowful time the family went to North <lb/>
Wales for a change, and later Frances visited her sister <lb/>
Miriam, who had married Henry Crane, Esq., of <reg orig="Oak-|hampton">Oakhampton</reg>, <lb/>
near Stamford, where she is remembered "as a <lb/>
clever, amusing child, sometimes a little wilful and <reg orig="trouble-|some">troublesome</reg> <lb/>
from mere excess of animal spirits, but always <lb/>
affectionate and grateful for any little treat; reading a good <lb/>
deal of poetry, and leaving traces of her studies in volumes <lb/>
found in hayloft, and manger, and garden nooks."</p>
<p>In 1850, when Frances was between thirteen and fourteen, <lb/>
she went to school and spent six months with Mrs. Teed, at <lb/>
Belmont. It was Mrs. Teed's <hi rend="italic">finale</hi> to a long course of <lb/>
school work; and her intense desire to influence her <lb/>
young pupils and to lead them to higher things, resulted in <lb/>
a sort of revival in the school. Girls are very <reg orig="impression-|able">impressionable</reg>. <lb/>
No doubt there was excitement; but that term was a <lb/>
turning-point to many a young life. Frances seemed to <lb/>
have been strongly impressed; but the clouds that <lb/>
obscured her inner path did not lift. She made a confidante <lb/>
of Miss Cooke, who afterwards became her stepmother, <lb/>
and found great comfort in her loving and wise counsel.</p>
<p>After her father's marriage Frances went to school at <lb/>
Powick Court, near Worcester. Unhappily, in December <lb/>
her studies were checked by severe erysipelas in her face <lb/>
and head. She was removed home, and all lessons <lb/>
prohibited. Her sister recalls her patience when almost <lb/>
blind. "She was so extremely agile in every movement," <lb/>
she adds, "a very fairy with her golden curls and light step, <lb/>
her father calling her his 'Little Quicksilver,' that to 'lie <lb/>
still' was no light trial."</p>
<pb n="357" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0390"/>
<p>In the following November she accompanied her parents <lb/>
to Germany, as her father wished to consult the great <lb/>
oculist, Dr. De Leuw. In a letter to a friend Frances <lb/>
writes: "The Hofrath says papa has incipient cataract, <lb/>
which he hopes to disperse. As we need remain here only <lb/>
three weeks, we shall winter in D&uuml;sseldorf. I will tell you <lb/>
about my school there, to which I am longing to return. <lb/>
The 'Louisenschule' is so called from the Queen of Prussia. <lb/>
&hellip; Fr&auml;ulein Quincke is a very excellent schoolmistress, <lb/>
and the masters are undoubtedly good.&hellip; The school is <lb/>
under the direction of that good man, Pastor Krafft, so <lb/>
altogether papa has decided to let me have my way, and <lb/>
return to school, while he and mamma travel about."</p>
<p>A few months later she wrote to the same friend from <lb/>
Obercassel: "&hellip; I have left school for ever, I suppose, <lb/>
and came here from D&uuml;sseldorf. What a suffocating <lb/>
feeling it is, leaving school for ever; a period, an era, <lb/>
completely passed and left behind. One feels that <reg orig="child-|hood">childhood</reg> <lb/>
is over now, and a sense of tenfold increased <reg orig="respon-|sibility">responsibility</reg> <lb/>
and independence, so to speak, is a weight upon the <lb/>
spirit.&hellip; "Only fancy, when the testimonies were given <lb/>
out at the Louisenschule, amidst heart-beating and <reg orig="cheek-|flushing">cheek-flushing</reg> <lb/>
&lpar;especially mine&rpar;, 'Frances Havergal, Numero <lb/>
Eins,' broke the stilled silence of the awed assemblage.&hellip; <lb/>
Proud I was, partly on account of being a daughter of <lb/>
Britain. I did not go to sleep till nearly midnight for <lb/>
pure delight and satisfaction.&hellip;</p>
<p>"In the Louisenschule, when a girl has not learnt <reg orig="every-|thing">everything</reg> <lb/>
&lpar;as you know I did not&rpar; she receives only her testimony, <lb/>
but no number. This half-year, however, it seems all the <lb/>
masters in council assembled were so very well pleased with <lb/>
the <foreign lang="ger"><hi rend="italic">Engl&auml;nderin's</hi></foreign> &lpar;English girl's&rpar; papers and conduct, that <lb/>
they agreed to break their rule for once, and honour me <lb/>
with Number 1, a thing they had never done before."</p>
<p>While her parents were at Heidelberg, Frances was left <lb/>
<pb n="358" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0391"/>
at Obercassel, a pleasant village on the Rhine, under the <lb/>
care of Pastor Schulze-Berge and the kindly Frau Pastorin. <lb/>
Frances seemed very happy with these good people. She <lb/>
made friends with the family of Count von Lippe, and <lb/>
read German with an adopted daughter, Fr&auml;ulein von <lb/>
Clondt.</p>
<p>Pastor Schulze-Berger spoke of his English pupil most <lb/>
warmly. "She was committed to my care for her studies," <lb/>
he writes, "in 1853 at Obercassel. I instructed her in <lb/>
German composition, literature and history. I learned to <lb/>
appreciate her rich talents and mental powers, so that the <lb/>
lessons were more pleasure than work. She showed from <lb/>
the first such rare talent, such depth of comprehension, <lb/>
that I can only speak of her progress as extraordinary.&hellip; <lb/>
What imprinted the stamp of nobility upon her whole <lb/>
being, and influenced all her opinions, was her true piety <lb/>
and the deep reverence she had for her Lord and Saviour, <lb/>
whose example penetrated her young life through and <lb/>
through."</p>
<p>In December 1853 Frances returned to England with <lb/>
her parents. The following July she was confirmed in <lb/>
Worcester Cathedral by the Bishop, Dr. Pepys. Frances <lb/>
always kept the anniversary of her confirmation.</p>
<p>On her return home she carefully kept up all her studies, <lb/>
making abstracts in German, French and English. With <lb/>
her father's help she acquired sufficient Greek to enjoy <lb/>
studying the New Testament.</p>
<p>Mr. Havergal had been again to Gr&auml;frath, in 1855, and <lb/>
returned with improved eyesight. It was a great joy to his <lb/>
family to see him in the reading-desk again, after nearly <lb/>
four years' absence.</p>
<p>In 1856 Frances went to Ireland. An Irish schoolgirl <lb/>
writes the following description of her: "In a few seconds <lb/>
Miss Frances, carolling like a bird, flashed into the room! <lb/>
Flashed! Yes, I say the word advisedly&mdash;flashed in like a <lb/>
<pb n="359" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0392"/>
burst of sunshine, like a hillside breeze, and stood before <lb/>
us, her fair, sunny curls falling round her shoulders, her <lb/>
bright eyes dancing, and her fresh, sweet voice ringing <lb/>
through the room. I shall never forget that afternoon, <lb/>
never! I sat perfectly spellbound as she sang chant and <lb/>
hymn with marvellous sweetness, and then played two or <lb/>
three pieces of Handel which thrilled me through and <lb/>
through. She finished with singing her father's tune, <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Hobart</hi>, to 'The Church of our Fathers.' &hellip; As we <lb/>
walked down the shady avenue, one and another said, <lb/>
'Oh, isn't she lovely?' and 'Doesn't she sing like a born <lb/>
angel?' &hellip; 'Oh, she's a real Colleen Bawn!' But from <lb/>
one young heart a different cry went up silently as she <lb/>
listened to the music: 'Lord, teach me, even me, to know <lb/>
and love Thee too!'"</p>
<p>During this summer Frances much enjoyed the study <lb/>
of Hebrew with J. H. S. She was blessed with a very <lb/>
retentive memory. She knew by heart the whole of the <lb/>
Gospels, Epistles, Revelation, the Psalms and Isaiah, and <lb/>
the Minor Prophets she learnt in later years.</p>
<p>In 1860 Rev. William Havergal resigned the living of St. <lb/>
Nicholas, and parting gifts flowed in from the parishioners. <lb/>
Amongst the testimonials there were gold watches for <lb/>
Frances and her sister, with the inscription, "From the <lb/>
Parishioners of St. Nicholas, Worcester, March 1860." The <lb/>
teachers and children of the Sunday-school also sent books. <lb/>
Frances Havergal was a model Sunday-school teacher. The <lb/>
work was very dear to her. Her sister tells us that "in <lb/>
the neatly bound register, entitled 'My Sunday scholars, <lb/>
from 1846 to 1860,' each child's birthday, entrance date, <lb/>
occurrences in their homes, general impressions of their <lb/>
character, and subsequent events in their life, are all carefully <lb/>
noted."</p>
<p>Leaving St. Nicholas was to Frances a mixture of sorrow <lb/>
and thankfulness. It was necessary for her father to have <lb/>
<pb n="360" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0393"/>
less work, and the little country parish of Shareshill seemed <lb/>
to offer him comparative rest.</p>
<p>"Papa is so very much to me," she writes in her <reg orig="warm-|hearted">warmhearted</reg> <lb/>
way; "so much more than all besides. He has <lb/>
been so very ill again, and this puts an end to all ideas of <lb/>
farewell sermons or visits. It is wonderfully thrilling to <lb/>
see him in illness: such utter peacefulness, such grand <lb/>
conceptions of God's absolute sovereignty in everything, <lb/>
such quiet rejoicing in His will, be it what it may, such <lb/>
shining trust in Him, in and for everything personal or <lb/>
parochial."</p>
<p>The removal to Shareshill proved beneficial. One of the <lb/>
first improvements effected in the new parish was the <reg orig="abo-|lition">abolition</reg> <lb/>
of the Sunday post. Frances Havergal shared her <lb/>
father's feelings on this subject. She always sympathised <lb/>
with the men deprived of their Sunday rest.</p>
<p>In February 1861 Frances undertook the instruction of <lb/>
her two nieces, the daughters of her sister, Mrs. Crane, and <lb/>
made Oakhampton her second home. Her father approved <lb/>
of this plan, as he thought it would prevent her studying so <lb/>
hard. The hours for lessons were short, and she had many <lb/>
pleasant changes of scene. "She entered with zest into the <lb/>
recreation of her young companions, riding and scrambling, <lb/>
swimming and skating, croquet and chess, each in their <lb/>
turn, and excelled in them all. Her needlework was <reg orig="ex-|quisite">exquisite</reg>, <lb/>
from the often despised darning to the most delicate <lb/>
lacework and embroidery." She was fond of utilising odds <lb/>
and ends of time, and actually learnt all the Italian verbs <lb/>
while her pupils were washing their hands before dinner. <lb/>
The old nurse used to vex herself sorely when she found <lb/>
her at her Latin books before breakfast.</p>
<p>But under the bright surface the inner life was not free <lb/>
from storm and stress. In her Autobiography she writes: <lb/>
"No one professing to be a Christian at all could possibly <lb/>
have had a more cloudy, fearing, doubting, sorrowing and <lb/>
<pb n="361" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0394"/>
wandering heart-history than mine has been through many <lb/>
years."</p>
<p>In the winter of 1865&ndash;6 Frances revisited her German <lb/>
friends, and resided with her parents for some time at Bonn. <lb/>
She had composed some songs, and was anxious to show <lb/>
them to Hiller, the German musician. His opinion was <lb/>
favourable on the whole. He told her that the melodies <lb/>
bore the stamp of talent, not of genius. She gave the <lb/>
account of her interview in a letter to Mrs. Crane. "But <lb/>
as for your harmonies," he continued, "I must say I am <lb/>
astonished. It is something singular to find such grasp of <lb/>
the subject, such power of harmonization, except where <lb/>
there has been long and thorough study and instruction. <lb/>
Here I can give almost unlimited praise." In answer to <lb/>
her questions, Hiller told her that in his opinion she had <lb/>
sufficient talent to warrant her, if she chose, in devoting <lb/>
herself to music as a life-work. He recommended her to <lb/>
study under Macfarren, and gave her the name of a book <lb/>
on harmony. The opinion of such an authority was very <lb/>
gratifying to Frances Havergal.</p>
<p>Her musical memory was singularly retentive. She <lb/>
would play through Handel, and much of Beethoven and <lb/>
Mendelssohn, without notes. When her nieces Evelyn <lb/>
and Constance Crane went to school, Frances left <reg orig="Oak-|hampton">Oakhampton</reg>. <lb/>
In the autumn she went to the Lakes with an <lb/>
old schoolfellow and a friend. She also joined the Young <lb/>
Women's Christian Association, and received her card of <lb/>
membership. This association was a lifelong rivet. She <lb/>
took interest in a great many societies, and collected for <lb/>
them steadily. The Jews, Church Pastoral Aid, and the <lb/>
Bible Society were alike valued.</p>
<p>In settling that winter into the new home, Pyrmont Villa, <lb/>
Leamington, Frances writes with much gravity to a friend: <lb/>
"My first note in my new room in our new house must be <lb/>
to you. It is solemn to think of what I may go through <lb/>
<pb n="362" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0395"/>
in this room; probably many happy hours, certainly many <lb/>
sorrowful ones&hellip; I have just been praying words from <lb/>
my own mamma's lips, when I was a little girl: 'Prepare <lb/>
me for all that Thou are preparing for me.'" And later on <lb/>
she writes most characteristically of her work. "I have <lb/>
not had a single poem come to me for some time, till last <lb/>
night, when one shot into my mind. All my best have <lb/>
come in that way, Minerva fashion, full-grown. It is so <lb/>
curious: one minute I have not an idea of writing anything, <lb/>
the next I have a poem. It is mine; I see it all, except <lb/>
laying out rhymes and metres, which is then easy work. <lb/>
I rarely write anything which has not come thus."</p>
<p>The illness and death of her young niece, Evelyn Crane, <lb/>
was a great sorrow to Frances Havergal. Three years <lb/>
before her loving influence and earnest counsel had won <lb/>
her to higher things, and her dying message spoke of her <lb/>
joyful trust and peace.</p>
<p>The following year Mr. Crane took Frances with his wife <lb/>
and eldest daughter to Switzerland, by the Rhine route to <lb/>
Heidelberg, Freiburg, Basle, and Schaffhausen; and Frances <lb/>
realised the dream of her life, and saw snow mountains; and <lb/>
in the autumn she went to Scotland, and thoroughly enjoyed <lb/>
the Highland scenery.</p>
<p>A sad trouble was impending. Her father's <reg orig="companion-|ship">companionship</reg> <lb/>
had always been dear to Frances. His classical <reg orig="know-|ledge">knowledge</reg>, <lb/>
his poetic and musical talents, were invaluable. She <lb/>
would seek his criticism on her poems. As her sister writes: <lb/>
"Very charming was it to hear her lively coaxing that <lb/>
he would just sing, as she accompanied his sacred songs; <lb/>
while at other times I have seen her absorbed with his <lb/>
impassioned melodies, fugues, and intricate progressions, <lb/>
thrilling yet passing."</p>
<p>His holy and consistent life was like a guiding light on <lb/>
his children's path. Now the shadow of death was <reg orig="over-|shadowing">overshadowing</reg> <lb/>
that happy home. On Easter Eve, 1870, he was <lb/>
<pb n="363" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0396"/>
unusually well. He rose early on Easter Day, but apoplexy <lb/>
ensued, and after forty-eight hours of unconsciousness he <lb/>
passed away.</p>
<p>As his daughter Frances wrote:&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"'Yet speaketh!' There was no last word of love,</l>
<l rend="indent">So suddenly on us the sorrow fell.</l>
<l>His bright translation to the home above</l>
<l rend="indent">Was clouded with no shadow of farewell.</l>
<l>His last Lent evening closed with praise and prayer,</l>
<l>And then began the songs of endless Easter there."</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>He was buried in Astley churchyard, under the fir tree, <lb/>
the spot he had chosen. The epitaph is as follows: "The <lb/>
Rev. William Henry Havergal, M.A., Vicar of Shareshill, <lb/>
and Hon. Canon of Worcester Cathedral. Died at <lb/>
Leamington, 19th April, 1870, aged 77. Curate 7, Rector <lb/>
13 years of this Parish&mdash;1822 to 1842. 'A faithful minister <lb/>
in the Lord' &lpar;Eph. vi. 21&rpar;."</p>
<p>Memorial tablets were also placed in Worcester cathedral <lb/>
and St. Nicholas and Shareshill churches.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Soon</hi> after her father's death, Frances Havergal <reg orig="under-|took">undertook</reg> <lb/>
the preparation for the press of Havergal's <lb/>
"Psalmody," which was afterwards used in connection <lb/>
with the Rev. C. B. Snepp's Hymnal, "Songs of Grace <lb/>
and Glory."</p>
<p>She alludes to the work of harmonizing in a letter to her <lb/>
friend, Miss Mary C.: "&hellip; The way I studied harmony <lb/>
was rather unique. Some years ago &lpar;at home&rpar; I kept a <lb/>
treatise on harmony in my bedroom, read as much as I <lb/>
could conveniently grasp the last thing, and then worked <lb/>
out the exercises in my head before going to sleep. This <lb/>
I did for several weeks, and suppose I must have taken it <lb/>
in very comfortably under this system, inasmuch as I had <lb/>
some work to persuade Hiller that I had gone through <lb/>
no 'academical course.'" And later she writes: "When <lb/>
composing some tunes at this time, I selected six about <lb/>
which I felt doubtful, and sent them to Sir Frederic <lb/>
Ouseley, asking him to say if they were all right. This he <lb/>
kindly did; to my great delight he endorsed them every <lb/>
one, and praised them too."</p>
<pb n="365" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0398"/>
<p>She wrote several hymns for "Songs of Grace and Glory." <lb/>
"Writing is praying with me," she said in another letter, <lb/>
"for I never seem to write even a verse by myself, and feel <lb/>
like a little child writing. You know a child would look up <lb/>
at every sentence and say: 'And what am I to say next?' <lb/>
That is just what I do: I ask that at every line He would <lb/>
give me, not merely thoughts and power, but also every <lb/>
word, even the very rhyme. Very often I have a most <lb/>
distinct and happy consciousness of direct answers.&hellip; I <lb/>
was so overwhelmed on Sunday at hearing three of my <lb/>
hymns touchingly sung at Perry church. I never before <lb/>
realised the high privilege of writing for 'the great <reg orig="congre-|gation">congregation</reg>,' <lb/>
especially 633: 'I gave my life for thee,' to papa's <lb/>
tune Baca."</p>
<p>In June 1871 Frances Havergal and her friend, Miss <lb/>
Elizabeth Clay, spent some weeks in Switzerland, with no <lb/>
luggage to encumber them beyond carpet-bags and <reg orig="knap-|sacks">knapsacks</reg>. <lb/>
She seems to have astonished the guide by her <lb/>
climbing powers. As an Alpine Clubbist remarked, "She <lb/>
went up like a chamois." And she thoroughly enjoyed the <lb/>
glissades down the mountains.</p>
<p>Christmas was a trying period now in the household at <lb/>
Leamington, and her father's loss was deeply felt. <reg orig="Ill-|health">Ill-health</reg> <lb/>
compelled Frances Havergal to give up a good deal <lb/>
of her work, and especially the training of the St. Paul's <lb/>
choir. "But," as she writes, "when a disappointment <lb/>
comes in that way, it must be His appointment."</p>
<p>It was the "turned lesson again," with the mark still <lb/>
set in the selfsame place. There is small wonder that <lb/>
she writes rather sadly to a trusted friend: "I have <lb/>
been feeling very down, and I hope really humbled; <lb/>
it seemed rather marked His not letting me write at <lb/>
all this year, and now taking away all work from me <lb/>
seems another sentence of the same lesson. I feel such <lb/>
a 'cumberer'; every one doing more and better than <lb/>
<pb n="366" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0399"/>
myself. Pray for me, that I may really learn all He is <lb/>
teaching me."</p>
<p>A few weeks in North Wales were of great benefit to her, <lb/>
and she seemed to recover health and buoyancy. There is <lb/>
a striking passage in a letter written in 1873, which speaks <lb/>
of the discipline of waiting. "Did you ever hear of any one <lb/>
being very much used for Christ who did not have some <lb/>
special waiting-time, some complete upset of all his or her <lb/>
plans first; from St. Paul's being sent off into the desert of <lb/>
Arabia for three years, when he must have been boiling <lb/>
over with the glad tidings, down to the present day?&hellip; <lb/>
My own case is far less severe, but the same in principle, <lb/>
that when I thought the door was flung open for me to go <lb/>
with a bound into literary life, it is opposed; the doctor <lb/>
steps in and says simply: 'Never! she must choose between <lb/>
writing and living; she can't do both.' That was in 1860. <lb/>
Then I came out of the shell with 'Ministry of Song' in <lb/>
1869, and saw the evident wisdom of having been kept <lb/>
nine years waiting in the shade."</p>
<p>That summer Frances Havergal accompanied her friends <lb/>
Mr. and Mrs. Snepp and their daughter Emily to Switzerland. <lb/>
While descending from Mont Blanc her love of glissading <lb/>
led her into imminent danger, and only Mr. Snepp's presence <lb/>
of mind saved her life and the life of one of the guides. <lb/>
Miss Havergal writes a graphic description of the occurrence.</p>
<p>"They would not unrope me. When we got to Pierre &agrave; <lb/>
l'Echelle, I was so enjoying my glissades, and presently <lb/>
thought we were come to a sufficiently easy part to go <reg orig="care-|lessly">carelessly</reg>, <lb/>
whereupon I slipped, and Payot the guide, who was <lb/>
next to me, totally lost himself too. Below us was a dark <lb/>
abyss. We both started a decidedly too rapid spin down a <lb/>
very steep incline to sheer precipice below: when <reg orig="in-|stantaneously">instantaneously</reg> <lb/>
Mr. Snepp did the only possible thing which <lb/>
could have saved all four of us&mdash;flung himself right on his <lb/>
back with his heels in the snow, the orthodox thing to do if <lb/>
<pb n="367" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0400"/>
only any one has the presence of mind to do it. Thus he <lb/>
was enabled to bear the immense strain on the rope and <lb/>
check our impetus; thank God, we soon recovered our <lb/>
footing.&hellip;"</p>
<p>On her return from Switzerland to Oakhampton, Frances <lb/>
Havergal immediately commenced work. Cottage visitations <lb/>
and four Bible-classes weekly occupied her time, and soon <lb/>
she assisted in preparatory work for a mission at Bewdley. <lb/>
In spite of fragile health she gave much help in the choir. <lb/>
During a mission week at Liverpool she was again at work. <lb/>
This year was a marked epoch in her inner life; "the <lb/>
'sunless ravines' were now for ever passed." She was <lb/>
lifted into sunshine, to quote her own words, "of which <lb/>
all she had previously experienced was but as pale and <lb/>
passing April gleams, compared with the fulness of summer <lb/>
glory."</p>
<p>Some time after this she said to her sister: "It was on <lb/>
Advent Sunday, December 2nd, 1873, I first saw clearly <lb/>
the blessedness of true consecration. I saw it as a flash of <lb/>
electric light, and what you see you can never unsee. There <lb/>
must be full surrender before there can be full blessedness."</p>
<p>Her sister adds: "The practical effect of this was most <lb/>
evident in her daily true-hearted, whole-hearted service <lb/>
for her King, and also in the increased joyousness of <lb/>
the unswerving obedience of her home life, the surest test <lb/>
of all."</p>
<p>The hymn, "From Glory to Glory" was written after this <lb/>
at Winterdyne; and her brother-in-law, Mr. Shaw, remembers <lb/>
her reading it to him and saying, "There! I could not <lb/>
have written this before," and how her radiant face bore <lb/>
testimony to her words.</p>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"The fulness of His blessing encompasseth our way,</l>
<l>The fulness of His promises crowns every brightening day,</l>
<l>The fulness of His glory is beaming from above,</l>
<l>While more and more we realise the fulness of His love."</l>
</lg></q>
<pb n="368" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0401"/>
<p>In 1874 there was another delightful visit to Switzerland <lb/>
with her niece Miss Constance Crane and other friends. <lb/>
Her circular letters home are full of interest. After a month's <lb/>
rest she took up work again. "At Armont Dessus" she speaks <lb/>
of "establishing herself with pen and ink in a shady nook <lb/>
by a little, steep downhill waterfall." It was here she <reg orig="com-|menced">commenced</reg> <lb/>
her poem "The Thoughts of God;" but then, as <lb/>
ever, she was ready to lay aside her pen, if any opportunity <lb/>
of doing some little wayside act of work, of speaking some <lb/>
word in season, came to her. About this time she set about <lb/>
"Little Pillows," "thirty-one short papers; as a book for <lb/>
children, of say twelve years old," she explains in one of <lb/>
her circular letters, "a short, easily recollected text to go to <lb/>
sleep upon for each night of the month, with a page or two <lb/>
of simple practical thoughts about it, such as a little girl <lb/>
might read every night while having her hair brushed. I <lb/>
think this will take me about a fortnight to write and arrange <lb/>
for the press; adding probably a verse or two of a hymn <lb/>
at the end of each of the papers. There are lots of little <lb/>
monthly morning and evening books for grown-up people, <lb/>
but I don't know of one for children except those containing <lb/>
only texts." In her next letter she says, "I have finished <lb/>
not only 'Little Pillows,' but a little companion to it for <lb/>
morning use, 'Morning Bells.' Both manuscripts are ready <lb/>
for press."</p>
<p>Miss Havergal had returned from Switzerland in perfect <lb/>
health and ready to resume active work, but before the year <lb/>
closed fresh discipline <unclear id="u1">to</unclear> try her. She had been paying <lb/>
a visit, and somehow or other she caught fever and <reg orig="com-|menced">commenced</reg> <lb/>
her homeward journey with headache and sickness; <lb/>
still she stayed at Willesden Junction to talk to a young <lb/>
stranger in whom her sister was interested, and to comfort <lb/>
her. The young lady afterwards wrote: "Oh if I could only <lb/>
feel as she looked; your sister Frances was so young and <lb/>
lovely, and I am glad I saw for once that God-satisfied <lb/>
<pb n="369" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0402"/>
face." On reaching Leamington shiverings and feverish <lb/>
symptoms set in, and Miss Havergal was soon prostrate with <lb/>
typhoid fever. About the middle of November she lay <lb/>
between life and death. Prayer was offered up unceasingly <lb/>
that the beloved life might be spared, and great was the joy <lb/>
of those who watched beside her bed, when at last they <lb/>
perceived that "this sickness was not unto death."</p>
<p>Later on she said to a sister: "I never thought of death <lb/>
as going through the dark valley, or down to the river; it <lb/>
often seemed to me a going up to the golden gates and lying <lb/>
there in the brightness, just waiting for the gate to open to <lb/>
me. I never before was, so to speak, face to face with death. <lb/>
It was like a look into heaven; and yet, when my Father <lb/>
sent me back again, I felt it was His will, and so I could <lb/>
not be disappointed."</p>
<p>About the middle of January change of air was prescribed, <lb/>
and she was taken to Winterdyne, Bewdley. As her sister, <lb/>
Marie Havergal, was assisting her into the carriage at <reg orig="Leam-|ington">Leamington</reg>, <lb/>
she received the news of their brother Henry's <lb/>
sudden death. He was Vicar of Cople, Bedfordshire. But <lb/>
the sad intelligence was kept from the invalid until the <lb/>
journey was over.</p>
<p>Unhappily, after a few days a relapse set in, and Frances <lb/>
Havergal was again ill for many weeks; but no nurse was <lb/>
needed, as the Winterdyne servants pleaded to be allowed <lb/>
to sit up in turn with "dear Miss Frances" However, in <lb/>
a few days, she became so ill that they telegraphed for <lb/>
Mrs. Havergal. When Frances saw her stepmother, her <lb/>
first words were: "I am trusting Him for every bit of the <lb/>
way." Her patience was marvellous; even when in acute <lb/>
pain she would say lively things to divert her nurses' <reg orig="atten-|tion">attention</reg> <lb/>
from her suffering. Once she said to her sister, "Oh, <lb/>
Marie, if I might have but five minutes' ease from pain! <lb/>
I don't want even to moan when gentle Sister Ellen comes <lb/>
in. How I am troubling you all!" Another day she said: <lb/>
<pb n="370" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0403"/>
"I think my special idea of heaven is seeing the Lord <lb/>
Jesus exalted, glorified, vindicated, reigning King of kings, <lb/>
and all His enemies serving Him."</p>
<p>Her recovery was slow, but her room was the brightest <lb/>
in the house. At last she was carried downstairs, but for <lb/>
some time used crutches. Her sister tells us that "<reg orig="needle-|work">needlework</reg> <lb/>
for the Zenana Mission was a great enjoyment to <lb/>
her." In April change of air was again recommended, and <lb/>
on the 3rd she left Winterdyne. The "Memorials" tell us <lb/>
that as the servants gathered round her she said: "It was a <lb/>
great comfort in my illness the way in which you waited <lb/>
upon me. I saw you never grudged the trouble I gave <lb/>
you; that would have distressed me. Remember God's <lb/>
promises are for each of you; faith is just holding out <lb/>
your hand and taking them.&hellip;" One inscription in the <lb/>
books she gave them is: "Fanny Holloway, with the <lb/>
writer's warm thanks for her great kindness and attention <lb/>
during her illness at Winterdyne, January to April 1875. <lb/>
'Inasmuch &hellip;' &lpar;St. Matt. xxv. 40&rpar;."</p>
<p>A short drive enabled her to reach Oakhampton, her <lb/>
sister, Mrs. Crane's, pleasant home. Wherever Frances <lb/>
Havergal visited, her constant consideration was for the <lb/>
servants of the house. Bible readings in the servants' <lb/>
halls, kind talks and helpful prayers, are all remembered. <lb/>
The large reference Bibles given at Oakhampton were <lb/>
much treasured, and she was deeply gratified when <lb/>
every servant there joined the Christian Progress Union. <lb/>
"Nearly nine months," she writes to Mr. W<gap desc="long dash" reason="missing" id="g2"/>, "since <lb/>
I was last at family worship. I was in almost too great <lb/>
spirits about it, which is not good for me, and of course <lb/>
I had to subside and go and lie down for a considerable <lb/>
part of the morning; still it was an epoch, after four <lb/>
months' illness and weakness. I am told that I must not <lb/>
expect to be fit for any sort of work for at least six <lb/>
months longer, but I do not feel one regret.&hellip; I do <lb/>
<pb n="371" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0404"/>
really and altogether desire that His will may be done, <lb/>
whatever it is."</p>
<p>With the return to health came a return to work, and by <lb/>
word or by letter her helpful sympathy was always ready; <lb/>
but she had another relapse in June. That autumn she <lb/>
went to Whitby with Mr. and Mrs. Shaw, and enjoyed a visit <lb/>
to York Minster and a pleasant interview with Dr. Dykes. <lb/>
From Whitby she writes: "Mamma is better, but has <lb/>
been so ill that it was a question whether she could reach <lb/>
England. I am so thankful for her. For myself I have <lb/>
not been ill, though often poorly since my last relapse in <lb/>
June; but I decidedly do not get strong, and am not <lb/>
nearly so strong as before my illness, even under these <lb/>
most favourable circumstances of bracing air.&hellip; I can <lb/>
do a little, write an hour or two, see one or two people, <lb/>
sing one song, go to church once on Sunday, and subside <lb/>
all the rest of the day; but that is the length of my tether. <lb/>
I came upon some verses which seem just to express it: <lb/>
<q><lg type="stanza">
<l>"'I am not eager, bold or strong,</l>
<l rend="indent">All that is past;</l>
<l>I'm ready not to do,</l>
<l rend="indent">At last, at last.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>"'My half-day's work is almost done,</l>
<l rend="indent">'Tis all my part;</l>
<l>I bring my patient God</l>
<l rend="indent">A patient heart.'</l>
</lg></q>
For I am quite satisfied to do a half-day's work henceforth, <lb/>
if He pleases; and well I may be when I have plenty of <lb/>
proof that He can make a half-hour's work worth a whole <lb/>
day's if He will, yes, or a half-minute's either."</p>
<p>Amongst the "turned lessons" of Frances Havergal's <lb/>
life was one especially trying to her. She had prepared <lb/>
for press many sheets of manuscript music for the Appendix <lb/>
to "Songs of Grace and Glory." They had only been <lb/>
sent to the publisher a week, when she received the news <lb/>
<pb n="372" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0405"/>
that Messrs. Henderson's premises had been burnt down, <lb/>
and the whole of the stereotypes of her musical edition <lb/>
destroyed. She writes to her sister: "The greater part of <lb/>
the manuscript of my Appendix is simply gone, for I had <lb/>
kept no copy whatever, and have not even a list of the <lb/>
tunes! Every chord of my own will have to be <reg orig="repro-|duced">reproduced</reg>; <lb/>
every chord of any one else's re-examined and <lb/>
revised.&hellip; Thus I am suddenly shut off from the bright <lb/>
stream of successful writing, and stopped in all my own <lb/>
plans for this spring, and bid work a few months longer in <lb/>
the shade at what is to me a special exercise of great <lb/>
patience. It is just what He did with me last year; it is <lb/>
another 'turned lesson.'"</p>
<p>During a visit to her brother, Rev. Francis Havergal, <lb/>
Vicar of Upton Bishop, near Ross, she spent a great deal <lb/>
of time going from house to house and reading to the <lb/>
people. The "Memorials" tell us that her singing from <lb/>
Handel's "Messiah," accompanying herself on her brother's <lb/>
organ, on her last Sunday evening at Upton Bishop, will <lb/>
long be remembered by all who heard. The old parish <lb/>
clerk remarked, "I never heard the like of that before." <lb/>
Frances became the first contributor to a fund for erecting <lb/>
a vestry. Since her death it has been determined that <lb/>
this vestry shall be specially "in memory of F. R. H." <lb/>
Her brother had her name cast in a new treble bell, thus <lb/>
completing the peal of six.</p>
<p>Frances Havergal's bright, sunshiny disposition attracted <lb/>
even strangers. Often people would say, "F. R. H. looks <lb/>
so really happy; she must have something we have not <lb/>
got." And she was also a great favourite with children; <lb/>
her sympathy with them, and her merry ways, drew them <lb/>
to her.</p>
<p>On July 6th, 1876, Frances Havergal and her unmarried <lb/>
sister left England for Lausanne. From Montreux they <lb/>
went to Les Avants, to visit Miss Whately, and from <lb/>
<pb n="373" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0406"/>
Vernazay they went to a quiet pension at Fin Haut, <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italic">en <lb/>
route</hi></foreign> for Argenti&egrave;re.</p>
<p>The crowds of peasants passing to early mass gave the <lb/>
sisters the idea of giving them a Bible address. About <lb/>
thirty or forty came. Frances Havergal had written a French <lb/>
hymn, "Seulement pour Toi," and the singing gave much <lb/>
pleasure, but, alas! the work was too much for her slender <lb/>
stock of strength. As she writes: "All the old elasticity and <lb/>
physical strength are gone. I don't feel the 'atmospheric <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">sal volatile</hi>,' and go out on the freshest of Swiss mornings <lb/>
feeling up to nothing, instead of equal to anything. Yet it <lb/>
is thirteen months since I was really cured from my illness." <lb/>
Still, there were "little wayside bits of work done." The <lb/>
passengers in the diligence from Visi&egrave;re joined heartily with <lb/>
the sisters in singing "Seulement pour Toi," and the driver <lb/>
took up the chorus.</p>
<p>Frances Havergal's brilliant playing in the saloon of the <lb/>
Great St. Bernard Hospice, where they spent Sunday, <lb/>
attracted the Fathers, and she sang for them and the <reg orig="assem-|bled">assembled</reg> <lb/>
strangers Handel's "Comfort ye," "He shall feed His <lb/>
flock," and "Rest in the Lord." It was her message, and <lb/>
while she sang she was praying secretly that it might touch <lb/>
some heart.</p>
<p>One of the strangers who crossed their path wrote <reg orig="after-|wards">afterwards</reg> <lb/>
to her sister: "I feel sure that God led us to <lb/>
Champ&egrave;ry that we might meet your dear sister Frances. <lb/>
Oh! I cannot tell what a blessing she was to me then. I <lb/>
always looked for those fair curls, and the saloon seemed <lb/>
desolate if I could not hear her voice and merry laugh.&hellip; <lb/>
Yes, it was on the balcony at Champ&egrave;ry that a new life and <lb/>
love seemed lighted up in my soul. Even as she was <lb/>
speaking to me I felt that, with God's grace, I must take <lb/>
the same step she had, and henceforth live 'only for Jesus.' <lb/>
That was indeed turning a perfectly new and bright page <lb/>
in my life."</p>
<pb n="374" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0407"/>
<p>Another Champ&egrave;ry friendship was with Baroness Helga <lb/>
von Cramm.</p>
<p>The tour was full of enjoyment and interest to both the <lb/>
sisters; but while they were staying in the Pension Wenzer <lb/>
above Lauterbrunnen, just opposite M&uuml;rren, Frances got <lb/>
wet through in a thunderstorm, and contracted a severe <lb/>
chill. A month's serious illness followed.</p>
<p>People were very kind to them, and they had the pension <lb/>
to themselves, and as soon as strength was restored they <lb/>
returned to England. Frances Havergal's illness had <lb/>
hindered all work, and it was a matter of regret that there <lb/>
would be no book for Christmas.</p>
<p>We will quote her sister's words. "It was after we <lb/>
had passed Oxford station on our way to Winterdyne, <lb/>
and I thought she was dozing, when she exclaimed, <lb/>
with that herald flash in her eye, 'Marie! I see it all; <lb/>
I can write a little book, "My King";' and rapidly <lb/>
went through divisions for thirty-one chapters. The <lb/>
setting sun shone on her face, and, even then, it seemed <lb/>
to me that she could not be far distant from the land of <lb/>
the King."</p>
<p>Illness came on again, accompanied by severe suffering; <lb/>
yet the book was quickly written and published. We may <lb/>
regard the pages in "My King" as the fruit of her patiently <lb/>
taking back the "turned lesson," which prevented her writing <lb/>
for so many months.</p>
<p>The year 1877 was passed at her home or in visits to her <lb/>
brothers and sisters, to Astley Moor and London. The <lb/>
distressing illness of her stepmother was a source of deep <lb/>
anxiety. But work went on steadily. "What am I to do?" <lb/>
she writes to one correspondent. "Your letter would take <lb/>
two hours to answer, and I have not ten minutes. Fifteen <lb/>
or twenty letters to write every morning; proofs to correct, <lb/>
editors waiting for articles, poems and music I cannot <lb/>
touch, American publishers clamouring for poems or any <lb/>
<pb n="375" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0408"/>
manuscripts, four Bible readings or classes weekly, many <lb/>
anxious ones waiting for help, a mission week coming, and <lb/>
other work after that; but my doctor says my physique is <lb/>
too weak to balance the nerves and brain, and that I ought <lb/>
not to touch a pen."</p>
<p>During the winter and spring of 1877&ndash;8 Mrs. Havergal <lb/>
was patiently bearing intense suffering, but still carrying on <lb/>
her Zenana and other meetings. But on May 26th the <lb/>
end came. Her last smile of recognition was for Frances. <lb/>
She was buried by her husband in Astley Churchyard, <lb/>
and her death was a great grief to her stepchildren, to <lb/>
whom she had been a loving mother and a wise friend <lb/>
and counsellor.</p>
<p>The home at Leamington was to be given up, and the <lb/>
two sisters were somewhat undecided in their <reg orig="arrange-|ments">arrangements</reg> <lb/>
for the future. As they both needed change, they <lb/>
went to the Mumbles with their brother, and secured <lb/>
lodgings for the winter. They then stayed some time at the <lb/>
"Highlands" Farm, near Titley in Herefordshire, returning <lb/>
to Leamington to break up the home..</p>
<p>It was at this time that Miss Havergal sold most of her <lb/>
jewellery and ornaments, the proceeds being devoted to <lb/>
the Church Missionary Society. On their last Sunday <lb/>
evening in Leamington the sisters attended service at Holy <lb/>
Trinity, when "Frances Havergal's hymn 'Thou art <lb/>
coming, O my Saviour,' was sang. On the last home <lb/>
evening she sent for a number of the night-school boys, <lb/>
and gave books, magazines, maps for their library, a <reg orig="magic-|lantern">magic-lantern</reg>, <lb/>
and other things. They then sang with her 'Tell <lb/>
it out,' and afterwards she spoke some bright, helpful <lb/>
words."</p>
<p>She spent the greater part of August with her brother <lb/>
Henry's widow and family in Somersetshire. Her nephews <lb/>
and nieces were always very close to her heart, and her <lb/>
influence over them was great. "Aunt Fanny always <lb/>
<pb n="376" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0409"/>
understands me," indicates her loving sympathy. Early in <lb/>
October she joined her sister in their Welsh retreat. She <lb/>
was very tired then, and needed rest. It was a pleasant <lb/>
little haven. Her study was cosy with home comforts, and <lb/>
her favourite pictures and busts were arranged in it.</p>
<p>"The small but select library," we read in the "<reg orig="Memo-|rials">Memorials</reg>," <lb/>
"showed the variety of her taste&mdash;classical, foreign, <lb/>
poetical, with many works on science, geology, etc. <reg orig="Hum-|boldt's">Humboldt's</reg> <lb/>
and Professor Ritchie's works &lpar;his last gift&rpar; she much <lb/>
enjoyed when the scant leisure came. The last books she <lb/>
had in reading were 'The Earth's Formation on Dynamical <lb/>
Principles,' by A. T. Ritchie; 'Goodwin's Works'; 'The <lb/>
Life and Letters of the Rev. W. Pennefather/ of which she <lb/>
said, 'I find such food in that book;' and 'The Upward <lb/>
Gaze,' by her friend Agnes Giberne, with which she was <lb/>
delighted.&hellip; It was at her study table that she read her <lb/>
Bible by seven in the summer and eight in the winter, her <lb/>
Hebrew Bible, Greek Testament, and lexicons being at <lb/>
hand.&hellip; Her harp piano was placed on a stand she <lb/>
contrived by dexterous carpentering."</p>
<p>"The last sacred song she composed was 'Saving all <lb/>
along,' and many other melodies to her hymns in 'Loyal <lb/>
Responses.' Her American typewriter was always close to <lb/>
her, and it was a great relief to her eyes to use it. Her <lb/>
couch faced the west window, with its view of Caswell Bay <lb/>
and its rocks, and it was here that she and her sister loved <lb/>
to watch the sunsets."</p>
<p>There was no lull in her work even in this peaceful <lb/>
retreat. "Rest!" she exclaims; "there is none for me <lb/>
apparently. Every post brings more letters from strangers <lb/>
alone than I and my sister can answer. It is nine months <lb/>
since I had a chance of doing a stroke of new work."</p>
<p>The appeals were miscellaneous. Hymns for special <lb/>
New Year's Services wanted. To write cards suitable to <lb/>
mourners. For set of six more "Marching Orders." <lb/>
<pb n="377" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0410"/>
Request for poems to illustrate six pictures. Request to <lb/>
write a book suitable to Unitarians. To promote a new <lb/>
magazine. To give opinion on an oratorio; with similar <lb/>
requests. No wonder the weary worker was at times <reg orig="over-|burdened">overburdened</reg>, <lb/>
yet she always wrote cheerily.</p>
<p>As usual she took interest in the cottagers, and began, <lb/>
with the vicar's consent, a Bible-reading for them. The <lb/>
room was always full, but the work exhausted her, and she <lb/>
was persuaded not to attempt larger meetings in the Newton <lb/>
Schoolhouse.</p>
<p>On her last Christmas morning she woke in severe pain <lb/>
and was very ill for some days, and her doctor wished her <lb/>
to have perfect rest. How worn and weary she was may be <lb/>
gathered from her own touching words to her sister. "I do <lb/>
hope the angels will have orders to let me alone a bit when <lb/>
I first get to heaven." There is something pathetically <lb/>
human in this cry of exhausted nature, praying only for <lb/>
stillness and repose, even in the Beatific Home.</p>
<p>In the "Journal of Mercies," which she kept in 1879, <lb/>
there are one or two entries that speak volumes. "A little <lb/>
respite from letter-writing" is one; "Frustration of plans, <lb/>
and solemn lessons," another. "Done with some musical <lb/>
work," and so on.</p>
<p>On January 28th Frances Havergal went to London to <lb/>
visit her friends, Mr. and Mrs. Watson and the Rev. C. <lb/>
Bullock; but infectious illness in Mrs. Bullock's family <lb/>
decided her to return to Wales. After this work seemed to <lb/>
increase. Many needed advice and instruction, and her <lb/>
frequent visits to the village school were of great benefit to <lb/>
the children. She took the greatest pains with them, and <lb/>
offered a new Bible to every child who would repeat <reg orig="per-|fectly">perfectly</reg> <lb/>
the fifty-third chapter of Isaiah. She had fixed Good <lb/>
Friday for hearing the repetitions; but she was ill then, and <lb/>
had to put off the children for another day. Her bright <lb/>
ways with the little ones, and her simple, loving words, won <lb/>
<pb n="378" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0411"/>
their young hearts. About this time she took up <reg orig="Temper-|ance">Temperance</reg> <lb/>
and Total Abstinence work. In her own words, "I <lb/>
haven't taken up teetotal work, but the work has taken up <lb/>
me.&hellip; I adopt the title of 'The Newton Temperance <lb/>
Regiment' to please my boys, who are a strong majority in <lb/>
favour of it and very hearty about it. I do love these little <lb/>
lads." The Baroness Helga von Cramm joined the sisters <lb/>
in May. She thought Frances Havergal looking "well and <lb/>
young and bright." The friends had pleasant seaside <lb/>
rambles together, and Frances sat beside her on the sand <lb/>
while she sketched the Mumbles Lighthouse.</p>
<p>On May 21st Frances Havergal had arranged to meet <lb/>
some men and boys in the village band. The spot was a <lb/>
cold one, and she returned chilled and wet with the rain <lb/>
and mist. The next day she seemed very poorly, but being <lb/>
Ascension Day she went to Holy Communion; and that <lb/>
evening she spoke to several lads.</p>
<p>The next day her sister sent for the doctor. There was <lb/>
to be a temperance meeting in the evening, but Frances <lb/>
Havergal cheerfully gave up her work to be present, and <lb/>
spent her time in stitching strong paper-tract bags for <lb/>
sailors, till she felt ill and returned to bed. A feverish <lb/>
night ensued. The next morning the Baroness von Cramm <lb/>
left them. At first she did not suffer much, but lay quietly <lb/>
in bed, with her kittens Trot and Dot on her duvet; but <lb/>
she rather astonished her doctor by asking him if he thought <lb/>
"she had a chance of going." He told her that she was not <lb/>
seriously ill.</p>
<p>On May 29th fever and internal inflammation came on, <lb/>
and all the agony of peritonitis. All attempts to relieve her <lb/>
sufferings seemed in vain; but through it all her patience <lb/>
and gentle consideration for her nurses never failed. Once <lb/>
she whispered, when she saw their distress, "It's home the <lb/>
faster!" and to her faithful attendant, Mary, she said, "God's <lb/>
will is delicious; He makes no mistakes." Soon after she <lb/>
<pb n="379" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0412"/>
said to one of her sisters: "Let my own text, 'The blood <lb/>
of Jesus Christ, His Son, cleanseth us from all sin,' be on <lb/>
my tomb: all the verse if there is room."</p>
<p>The constant sickness was very distressing, and nothing <lb/>
alleviated her suffering. When she asked her doctor the <lb/>
source of the danger, he replied: "You are seriously ill, and <lb/>
the inflammation is increasing;" and her reply was: "I <lb/>
thought so; but if I am going it is too good to be true." <lb/>
And later on, to her sister she said: "Spite of the breakers, <lb/>
Marie, I am so happy; God's promises are so true. Not <lb/>
a fear!"</p>
<p>On Whit Tuesday, at the dawn of day, the change came. <lb/>
Her beloved ones were round her. Her sister describes that <lb/>
last peaceful scene in the "Memorials": "Whispering the <lb/>
names of many dear ones, she added, 'I love them all. <lb/>
Then, as it were with her last look on them from the opening <lb/>
golden gates, she said yearningly, 'I want all to come to me <lb/>
in heaven: oh don't, don't disappoint me! Tell them <lb/>
"Trust Jesus."' One of her sisters began repeating the <lb/>
hymn, 'Jesus, I will trust Thee.' Clearly, though faintly, <lb/>
she sang the whole verse to her own tune, <hi rend="italic">Hermes</hi>. Then <lb/>
came a terrible rush of convulsive sickness. It ceased. <lb/>
The nurse gently assisting her, she nestled in the pillows, <lb/>
folded her hands on her breast, saying, 'There, it is all <lb/>
over! Blessed rest!' There was a lovely radiance on <lb/>
her face. Then once more she tried to sing, one high <lb/>
sweet note, then her voice failed,&mdash;and as her brother <lb/>
commended her into her Redeemer's hand, she peacefully <lb/>
passed away."</p>
<p>On June 9th they laid her beside her father in Astley <lb/>
churchyard. "A golden star of Banksia roses, a poet's <lb/>
wreath of laurel and bay, and many white crowns were laid <lb/>
on it." In her sister's touching words: "There, within <lb/>
sight of her birthroom in the rectory, and under the branches <lb/>
of the fir tree her father planted &lpar;and away beyond, the hills <lb/>
<pb n="380" entity="Cary_TwelveNotableWomen_0413"/>
and valleys of her childhood's haunts encircling us&rpar;, we laid <lb/>
our dear sister, in sure and certain hope of her resurrection <lb/>
to eternal life."</p>
