                <p>Present as well were <name type="present">John T. Casteen, III, Leonard W.

                        Ms. Jeanne Flippo Bailes</name>.</p>
                <p>(The Board had met briefly, as the full Board, the previous afternoon, October
                    3rd, at The University of Virginia's College at Wise. See the separate Minutes
                    of that meeting.)</p>
                <p>The Rector opened the meeting and asked <name>Mr. Glazer</name> to lead the Board
                    in the Pledge of Allegiance.</p>
                <p>The Minutes of the meetings of May 31-June 2, and July <reg orig="12-|13"
                        >1213</reg>, were approved.</p>
                <p>The Rector read to the Board the annual certification, required by the Atlantic
                    Coast Conference, that the President is responsible for the direction of
                    athletics programs at the University.</p>
                <p>The persistent drought in Charlottesville has necessitated action by the
                    University to conserve water. A previous drought in 1998 led to the creation of
                    a University committee to deal with the problem, and this committee has
                    continued its work <pb n="6259" ed="vol"/> through the present water shortage.
                    The Rector, and the President, noted that the committee has done outstanding
                    work in finding ways to conserve water.</p>
                <p>The Rector introduced the members of the committee, known as the UVa Drought
                    Management Team: <name>Ms. Cheryl Gomez and Messrs. William Cromwell, Robert
                        Dillman, David Hudson, David Gipson, Richard Kovatch, and Anthony
                        Motto</name> (<name type="absent">Mr. Kovatch</name> could not be
                    present).</p>
                <p>At the Rector's request, <name>Ms. Gomez</name>, the Chair of the group,
                    addressed the Board briefly on the work of the Team.</p>
                <p> The Rector thanked <name>Messrs. Crutchfield, Goodwin and Saunders</name> for
                    providing the aircraft used to transport the Board to Wise on October 3<hi
                        rend="super">rd</hi>.</p>
                <p>The Rector noted that he and <name>Mr. Rainey</name> have asked the Young Alumni
                    Council to work with the Board to help strengthen the fraternity and sorority
                    system at the University. The Council will report on this at the January meeting
                    of the Board.</p>
                <p>The President then gave his customary report.</p>
                <p>He commented briefly on the state budget crisis before noting that in the most
                    recent U.S. News and World Report ranking, released on September 13<hi
                        rend="super">th</hi>, the University is still rated the number two public
                    institution. The University's overall ranking, however, has dropped two spots to
                        23<hi rend="super">rd</hi>. The primary factor in this decline, he said, is
                    faculty resources &mdash; the University's ranking in this category has dropped
                    from 28<hi rend="super">th</hi> last year to 35<hi rend="super">th</hi> this
                    year, and will continue to drop with the lack of funding for faculty salary
                    increases.</p>
                <p>Citing several awards that have come to the University, the President said that
                    for the second year in a row, a member of the faculty has received a MacArthur
                    Foundation "genius award:" <name>Dr. Janine Jagger</name> of the School of
                    Medicine.</p>
                <p><name>Mr. David A. Harrison, III</name> (College '39, Law '41) of Prince George,
                    died in June and bequeathed &dollar;64million to the University. Of this,
                    &dollar;34.8million is for the endowment of professorships in Law,
                    &dollar;20.3million for faculty support in the School of Medicine,
                    &dollar;5.8million for athletics, and &dollar;3.1million <pb n="6260" ed="vol"/>
                    to the University Library for the Harrison Institute for American History,
                    Literature, and Culture. In addition, <name>Mr. Harrison</name> created an
                    irrevocable trust in excess of &dollar;50million, which will come to the
                    University in twenty five years. With these gifts, the benefactions of <name>Mr.
                        Harrison</name> and his late wife, <name>Mary</name>, to the University come
                    to more than &dollar;150million.</p>
                <p>The President also noted the deaths, in the last few months, of three friends of
                    the University: <name>Mr. Bayard Sharp</name> (College '36), <name>Mrs. Oleda
                        Casscells</name> (Law '49) and <name>Ms. Avis Pringle</name>.</p>
                <p>The President concluded his remarks with his usual Gifts and Grants Report.</p>
                <p>In the Fiscal Year which ended on June 30<hi rend="super">th</hi>, private giving
                    to the University and its related foundations totaled &dollar;255million, which
                    was a record single-year amount and &dollar;65.1million above the previous
                    Fiscal Year.</p>
                <p>Significant new pledges made since the June meeting of the Board include an
                    anonymous promise of &dollar;5million to assist with the funding of the Carr's
                    Hill Arts Grounds, and &dollar;1.6million to the Miller Center Foundation from
                    the Scripps Foundation. This latter gift was provided through the Scripps
                    Foundation by <name>Mrs. Elizabeth Scripps Harvey</name> and her husband,
                        <name>Jeremy G. Harvey</name>.</p>
                <p> On motion, the Gifts and Grants Report was accepted by the Board.</p>
                <ornament type="characters">--------------</ornament>
                <p> On behalf of the Wise community, <name>Mr. Pippin</name> thanked his colleagues
                    on the Board for traveling to The University of Virginia's College at Wise the
                    previous day. The Board's visit, he said, meant a great deal to everyone at the
                    College. The Board adjourned at 9:15 a.m., to go into Committee meetings.</p>
                <ornament type="characters">--------------</ornament>
                <p> The Board resumed in Open Session at 2:15 p.m., Friday, October 4<hi
