            <p>
            Well, how go 
            the showers and the
            large rest?  Hope you
            are feeling quite yourself
            again and that your
            mother has entirely recovered.
            </p><p>
            Hall brought down a 
            Boche in their lines.  He
            said he hadn’t attacked and 
            was just shooting to
            bother the German when a
            lucky ball hit him.
            </p><p>
            Lieut. Chaput who has 
            brought down so many Boches

            was terribly wounded yesterday.
            He managed to regain the
            line.  Nungesser is with
            us now.  Seems a nice
            chap but draws the long
            bow.

            Paul tells me he
            received a card from you
            but with no address on
            it and he couldn’t reply.
            </p><p>
            The dog is still absent
            and I may not get him
            until I go in on permission.
            Sorry for I should have
            liked to tell you about
            him.
            </p><p>
            Remember Suckley?  He’s
            head of an A.A. section and

            for the present stationed
            at Pont a Nousson.  I’m
            going to fly over some
            day and wave hello.
            </p><p>
            Lovell is now at Buc
            training.  Wouldn’t it have
            been funny if we could
            have looked ahead when we
            were on the boat.
            </p><p>
            I hear the Legion went
            into the battle of the
            Somme 3,000 strong and
            came out 800.  They did
            great work, tho [sic].  Several
            Americans were killed and
            wounded.
            </p><p>

            When do you now plan 
            on returning to Pauam?
            Be sure and let me know.
            </p><p>
            My mind is a blank so
            please excuse dry letter.  Have
            been on guard since three
            a.m. and am tired.
