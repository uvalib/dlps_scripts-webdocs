            [In the above letter, several words at the end are lined through and not discernable.  In the text 
            the soldier mentions that he is with the 18th Maine.  His letter is not signed.  However, it is 
            obviously written by one of the Huntley brothers, probably James.  There are several 
            letters in this collection signed by either Ambrose A. Huntley or James W. Huntley. 
            
            According to Robert K. Krick, recently retired as National Park Historian of the Fredericksburg 
            and Chancellorsville battlefields, the Huntley brothers served with the 1st Maine Heavy Artillery, 
            formerly the 18th Maine Infantry.  According to Horace H. Shaw's 
            The First Maine Heavy Artillery, 1862-1865 (Portland, 1903)*, and referenced by Mr. Krick, 
            Ambrose A. Huntley enlisted at age 23 as a musician.  He was promoted to sergeant in January 1864.  
            Ambrose was killed in action on 19 May 1864 near the Harris Farm at Spotsylvania Court House, Virginia.  
            His brother, James W. Huntley enlisted at age 22 at East Machias, Mass.  He was promoted to 
            corporal on 9 June 1864 and to sergeant on 1 January 1865.  He was wounded in action on 18 June 1864 
            on the main opening day at Petersburg.  He was discharged on 6 June 1865 and lived until 1891.
