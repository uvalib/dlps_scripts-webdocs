            <p>
            Even now its a short note,
            Marcelle, for the work is pressing.
            I do not want to let another day go
            by, however, without letting you
            know how much I appreciate all
            your goodness to me while I was 
            in Paris.  It was fine of you to
            take your leave while I had mine
            and to let me see so much of
            you.  I am afraid, tho, [sic] that I
            abused your hospitality in seeking 
            to see as much as possible of 
            you.  I dare not count all the times
            I was at your apartment for fear
            of feeling ashamed of myself.  I feel
            as if I had about lived there.
            It was all so delightful, and every
            thing we did I enjoyed so thoroughly.
            And then there was Versailles.  It
            is hard to speak of that &mdash; It
            was a dream day, &mdash; an exquisite
            harmony that your presence made
            me feel.  There is no day in my 
            life that can compare with that
            one.  
            </p><p>
            I’m back again at the old
            duty and now I do not know
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0178"/>
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0179" n="[p.2]"/>
            
            when I shall see you again.  It
            depends a great deal of course
            on how my plans work out and
            what comes of my application.  In
            a way I’d be an awful lemon to
            go back to Salisbury and the section
            but if in the future there’s not
            much work here I will be of more
            use someplace else.  An aviator
            named ______ [name has been erased]  has been staying with
            us for a few days and evidently
            enjoying himself a great deal.  He
            was reforme and didn’t have to 
            go into the corps but being a 
            great flier and a Frenchman offered
            his services.  He wants to come with
            us but of course can’t unless he
            gets shot up and is unable to
            fly.
            </p><p>
            Rules en ce moment are especially
            strict about telling anything of
            interest so I can’t talk about
            the war.
