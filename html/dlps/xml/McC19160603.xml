            <p>
            Thanks old pal for talking things
            over with Grundy.  I heard from him
            yesterday, and he says that I can
            trust him to get as good a return
            as possible.  I sent him an account
            of the rotten day we had June 1st.
            Maybe you can fix up something for
            yourself for your various connections
            from story.  Don’t know if Kiffin
            has written you or not.
            </p><p>
            I left Luxueil late in afternoon
            of the 31st.  Had to fly low on
            account of clouds.  Landed at Toul
            and spent the night.  Mist in
            morning and didn’t get away until
            8.30. A.M.  Landed here and the Capt. asked
            me if I could go out at 12.30.  Didn’t
            know country at all and saw map for
            first time when I climbed in machine.
            Was afraid I’d get lost.  Lovebury left
            and then I.  Just as Hall was
            starting he looked up and saw a 
            flock of Boches overhead.  Lovebury &amp; I
            must have passed right under them.
            Capt G. - Cowden, Prince, Chapman &amp; Hall
            mounted to attack.  Kiffin’s machine was
            on the bum and he couldn’t go.
            They got their height and returned
            to fight the 14 Boches who by 
            this time were over town dropping
            
            (over)
                        
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001108_0174" n="[p.2]"/>
            
            bombs.  The Boches used explosive
            bullets.  Capt. G. had a hole blown in
            tank and came down.  Prince had
            bottom of carlingue blown up and was
            put out of commission.  Cowden’s
            Mitrailleuse went on the bum.  Hall &amp;
            Chapman chased Boches to line but
            lost them.  While Americans were
            fighting in air the American
            Ambulance section I had been with
            at Pont was working on the ground.
            <hi rend="underline">_</hi> They were shifted here a little while
            ago. &mdash; Lovell was fine.  He stood
            right smack in middle of square
            where most bombs were dropping
            and directed his cars.  The boys
            did well.  Many cars were hit.
            One English chap ^British A. had his arm blown
            off.  Interesting dope for the Yankees
            having Americans in air and on the
            ground working against Boche.  40 killed
            and 200 wounded in town.
            </p><p>
            Well I lost myself as I felt
            I would and wandered in general
            direction of lines.  Just before I
            got to them I looked down and
            saw a machine.  Thought it
            one of ours of course as I didn’t
            know about fight.  Looked closer
            and saw the crosses.  I shut
            off my power, reached for the
                        
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001108_0175" n="[p.3]"/>
            
            manet of the Mitrailleuse and piced.
            I hadn’t the remotest idea about
            how to go about it.  It was
            the first time I’d shot my Mitrailleuse 
            &mdash;first Boche I’d ever seen.  I swooped
            down on him and saw he carried 
            two guns.  The fellow in back
            opened up fire.  I took a bead at
            50 meters and let go a round.
            Then my speed carried me off.  I
            turned back but it must have been
            a punk move for I found myself
            sighting into the flame of his
            machine gun.  I was right on his
            level.  I then heard his bullets
            going into my machine.  He had a 
            dead bead.  I shot at him, turned
            and then came from other side.
            As I pressed on manet the machine
            gun failed to shoot.  I turned, dropped
            the gun, armed it, tried it, nothing 
            doing.  Tried again, nothing doing.  Then
            tut-tut-tut back of my head I
            looked back and saw the German
            heading for me shooting.  I piced and
            lost him.  Looked at machine gun
            and found roller of cartridges had
            gone overboard.  The radiator was loose
            as well and I figured bullet had
            hit the piece.  Well then I
            wondered where I was.  In case of
                        
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001108_0176" n="[p.4]"/>
            
            doubt go south west.  I did and
            picked up a canal hoping to
            follow it up and find home.
            Tried other canals, crossed big 
            towns.  I knew I was below part
            of the country shown on my map
            but couldn’t figure which way to
            go to run across our field.
            Motor began to go wrong.  At 3 I
            gave up job and decided to land.
            Picked out a field that looked as
            if it were made for Aviation.  Redressed
            and skimmed along ground losing speed
            when there was a hell of a bump
            and over I went smashing everything.
            I had hit the field at St. Dizier where
            everyone smashes.  It is covered with
            grass and has shelves in it.  The only
            way to land is from the direction I
            didn’t take.  Well I felt rotten.  Looked
            the old buss [sic] over and found nine
            bullet holes in upper and lower wings not 
            a foot from each side of me.  He got
            me well on each side but fortunately
            didn’t hit between.  I’ll have another
            machine in a coupe of days.  Rotten
            to lose the Boche that way.  I
            could have bawled.
