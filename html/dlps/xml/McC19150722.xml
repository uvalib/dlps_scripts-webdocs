            Dear Paul:
            </salute></opener>
        		
        		<p>
            I was awfully glad to hear from
            you last night, but mighty sorry to
            learn about the Americans in the Iur.
            That’s a hell of a stiff percentage.
            Sorry Kiffin has to go back so soon.
            Yes I read about Weeks some time ago.
            </p><p>
            Just at present I haven’t time for
            a regular letter, but I want to get
            these &mdash; few &mdash; lines off with a request
            that you let me know what your
            plans are as soon as you can after
            you pass the Commission.  I can
            get a six or seven day permission either
            in August or September, tho [sic] I am
            not sure about August.  At any rate
            as soon as I hear from you I
            will fix a time for taking my leave.
            You see if you are going to pull <unclear>of [off]</unclear>
            the marriage in the Fall I can wait
            until then and if not I want to
            go in as soon as I can.  So please
            let me know as quickly as possible what
            your plans are after you get your
            status doped out.  The whole bunch out
            here is waiting turn on permission.
            The telephonists at the trench switch
            boards are starting in cahque a sa
            tour, to day, and the Artillerymen are
            on the move.  As only one goes at a time
                        
            <pb n="[p.2]"/>
            
            it will be long before they all get 
            a look in.
            </p><p>
            No word from Johnson or Rumsey.  Tho [sic] I
            know they’re up around Dunkirk.  Harrison
            went back to America sometime ago.  Our
            chef Ned Salisbury is in Paris for eight
            days at present.  Queer, it had been quiet
            for almost eight days before he left.  An 
            hour after we commenced to get it.  To
            day it started in again and stopped a 
            few minutes ago.  Up around the trenches
            all is fairly quiet save for the occasional
            shots and in the lines crapoullot and
            grenades.
            </p><p>
            Mighty nice of you to ask me to put
            up at the hotel with you when I go in.
            My clothes are at the Ambulance, tho, [sic] and
            grub stake, but maybe we can arrange
            a deal.  I want to see a lot of you
            that’s all.  Will drop you another line
            damn soon.  Got to get some sleep after
            a wash up and the time’s short.
            Anon mon “compain”  Don’t worry,
            On les ora, les salauds!  You’re
            right about the States.  Its disgusting
            the way they’re doing.  Up to two months
            ago they were making but 1/20 eu [sic] of
            1 percent of the ammunition.  Mais
            maintenant ca marche mieux.
