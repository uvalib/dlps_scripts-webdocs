            Well we are where we 
            wanted to get and in
            a position to do really
            useful work.  If we were 
            any nearer we’d have to
            crawl in the trenches.  At
            our base we are fixed
            up in fine shape.  I’m
            billited [sic] on two old souls
            who have given me a bed
            and who look after my
            few wants.  Now and anon
            the Germans give us a 
            party and bang away.  The
            other day they turned loose
            at the station.  Two little
            children who were playing
            in the street were killed
            by an obus.  I went
            down to see the damage
            and heard the mother
            up above us crying over 
            the bodies of her only boy
                        
            <pb n="[p.2]"/>
            
            and girl.  It was very
            pitiful.  The next
            morning before I was up
            eight more shells came
            in.  The nearest was about
            four hundred yards from
            us.  It killed an old
            woman.  The entertaining
            part about the game is
            that you don’t know
            where they’re going to
            land, as you know well.
            I could hear a faint, distant
            boom, then a suction sound
            followed by the tearing ziff,
            ziff, ziff as the damned obus
            came towards us.  It was
            comforting to hear the crash 
            and to know it hadn’t landed
            on my house.
        		</p>

            On the way to our 
            advance post there is a
            kilometere [sic] of road that is
            shelled.  Our convoy spreads 
            out and kills it along
                        
            <pb n="[p.3]"/>
            
            that part.  Our advance
            post is under a good
            deal of fire.  The other 
            day 126 shells landed in
            the berg.  Our quarters
            there are very comfortable,
            but draughty [sic], due to the shell holes.  We have
            mattresses out there in
            a room that looks out 
            on the German lines 1,400
            yards off.  We could be 
            potted by rifles if the
            Boche thought it worth 
            while.

        		<p>
            The day before yesterday
            I met an American that
            looked as if he had just
            stepped off Broadway.  His
            clothes were typically
            American and his trousers
            were turned up, and
            pressed!  I wondered what 
            he could be doing away
            out there.  It seemed so
                        
            <pb n="[p.4]"/>
            
            queer to see this
            immaculate person
            around.  It developed that
            he was an engineer on a 
            big job near there and
            has stuck to his post
            during the war.  He
            saw the German occupation
            and the battles that
            followed.  His views and 
            tales are very interesting.
            Decker is the fellows name.
