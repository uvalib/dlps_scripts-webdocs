</epigraph>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">It</hi> is a well-known fact of our experience that the <lb/>
features and figures of those we know best&mdash; <lb/>
those of our familiar friends, for instance&mdash;are always <lb/>
the most difficult to recall to our remembrance when <lb/>
they are absent; and in the same way there are <lb/>
certain characters in real life whose portraits are <lb/>
blurred and dimmed by our very familiarity with the <lb/>
details of their existence. This seems to be <reg orig="especi-|ally">especially</reg> <lb/>
the case with Jeanne d'Arc, the Maid of Orleans.</p>
<p>We seem to have known about her always. Our <lb/>
history-books, even the most prosaic of them, wax <lb/>
faintly enthusiastic over her courage and success; <lb/>
<pb n="2" entity="b000514724_0023"/>
but, on the whole, we take her life and personality <lb/>
very much as a matter of course. Yet, if we could <lb/>
only come fresh to her, and try to realise her from a <lb/>
perfectly detached point of view and from a modern <lb/>
standpoint, she would certainly exist for us as one <lb/>
of the most marvellous manifestations of the world's <lb/>
history.</p>
<p>Here is a young peasant girl, with no hereditary <lb/>
instinct for warfare or command, quiet, shy, fond of <lb/>
church-going and of dreamy reveries, but by no <lb/>
means highly-strung, morbid, or hysterical. To her <lb/>
comes that Call which some of us name Vocation <lb/>
and others the Voice of God.</p>
<p>Without the smallest hesitation or scruple she <lb/>
obeys. Within one short year she has relieved <lb/>
beleaguered cities, stormed redoubts, converted her <lb/>
rough soldiery, routed archbishops and bishops and <lb/>
scheming courtiers whose jealousy strove to paint <lb/>
her as a witch, and performed feats of valour that <lb/>
would be remarkable in a well-trained general, and <lb/>
were miraculous in the case of a simple country girl. <lb/>
And all this when she was seventeen!&mdash;the age at <lb/>
which most girls are either in the schoolroom or <lb/>
taking a "little place," according to their rank in <lb/>
life. No one who realises this, and remembers that <lb/>
there is no exaggeration&mdash;rather the reverse, indeed <lb/>
&mdash;in the contemporary records of her life-work, can <lb/>
deny that Jeanne d'Arc is a proof that the Age of <lb/>
Miracles was not past, in the fifteenth century, at <lb/>
any rate.</p>
<p>We have no description of the actual appearance <lb/>
of the Maid. For most of us, I imagine, who have <lb/>
<pb n="3" entity="b000514724_0024"/>
been fortunate enough to see it, the statue designed <lb/>
by the Princess Marie of Orleans, in the Gallery at <lb/>
Versailles, fulfils most nearly our ideal. The Maid <lb/>
is straight and tall, with well-made limbs under her <lb/>
soldier's dress. In her crossed arms she holds her <lb/>
sacred sword, cross-handled too, in emblem of her <lb/>
martyrdom; and the girlish head is bent, with a <lb/>
pensive touch around the firm young lips, as though <lb/>
she sees the tossing crowd around the scaffold and <lb/>
the crackling faggots round the stake, as she listens <lb/>
for her "Voices" in vain.</p>
<p>Before we can in the least realise the work that <lb/>
Jeanne was called to do, we must try to understand <lb/>
the condition of France during her childhood.</p>
<p>As a united nation France had ceased to exist. <lb/>
Divided by distinctions of "clan," almost more than <lb/>
by natural boundaries, Burgundians, Armagnacs, <lb/>
Orleanists, Parisians, Gascons, and Bretons were as <lb/>
much the sworn foes of each other as England was <lb/>
of any one of them.</p>
<p>To imagine, therefore, that England was at war <lb/>
with France &mdash; united France &mdash; during the long <lb/>
struggle of the Hundred Years is to fall into a <lb/>
complete error. It is true that Henry v. aimed at <lb/>
taking the crown from the head of Charles the <lb/>
Dauphin, but it by no means followed that all <lb/>
France was opposed to this attempt. Burgundy's <lb/>
powerful Duke, for example, was far more inclined <lb/>
to favour the cause of the English than that of the <lb/>
French king, and actually did so during a great part <lb/>
of the war. This state of things may be traced to <lb/>
many causes. Unchecked feudalism was one of them, <lb/>
<pb n="4" entity="b000514724_0025"/>
for long licence had literally made the barons think <lb/>
themselves as good as the king. The weakness of <lb/>
the monarchy was another, and a very considerable <lb/>
cause, during Jeanne's early life.</p>
<p>The French king, Charles VI., was insane, and his <lb/>
only son, the Dauphin, was a weak, pleasure-loving <lb/>
lad, with no will or individuality of his own. <lb/>
Moreover, the Treaty of Troyes, which had been <lb/>
accepted by one part of the country at least, put <lb/>
his claim to the throne aside in favour of the <reg orig="child-|prince">child-prince</reg>, <lb/>
Henry VI. of England. It is no wonder, <lb/>
therefore, that the northern part of France, with <lb/>
Paris as its centre, was utterly lost to the uncrowned <lb/>
Charles VII. at his father's death, and that the <lb/>
lands south of the Loire, to which Orleans was the <lb/>
key, were fast slipping from his uncertain grasp.</p>
<p>It was from the farthest corner of France that <lb/>
the deliverer came.</p>
<p>In the little grey village of Domremy, close to <lb/>
the border of Alsace, Jeanne was born. A loyal <lb/>
hamlet was Domremy, holding fast to the side of <lb/>
the uncrowned king, while its nearest neighbour, <lb/>
Maxey, was for the cause of Burgundy and <lb/>
England. No English soldier would pass so far <lb/>
from the beaten track, but more than once the <lb/>
terrified villagers were roused by the tramp of the <lb/>
fierce Burgundian bands, and fled with their <lb/>
children and all that they could carry with them <lb/>
before the face of the marauders, taking refuge <lb/>
over the border till the passing of the storm left <lb/>
them free to creep back to their ruined homes. <lb/>
Such an experience would bite deep into the <lb/>
<pb n="5" entity="b000514724_0026"/>
memory of little Jeanne, the farmer's daughter, and <lb/>
stand out in glaring colours from the grey canvas <lb/>
of her everyday life.</p>
<p>But usually things were very quiet in Domremy. <lb/>
Jacques d'Arc, the girl's father, worked his small <lb/>
farm with the aid of his three sons, and Jeanne, <lb/>
with her sister, stayed at home, helped her mother <lb/>
in the house, or spent long hours in spinning, or <lb/>
in the fine embroidery and other needlework for <lb/>
which Isambeau d'Arc was famous. Her mother <lb/>
was her only teacher, and her little stock of <lb/>
knowledge would consist of a few simple prayers, <lb/>
some Bible stories or legends of the saints maybe, <lb/>
and the intricate lore of the busy needle. Her <lb/>
teaching fell upon a singularly receptive little mind, <lb/>
however, and its lack of scope was more than atoned <lb/>
for by the vivid imagination which filled in the <lb/>
outlines and laid on the colours for itself.</p>
<p>From the cottage garden, where much of her <lb/>
time was spent, she could hear the bells chiming <lb/>
from the village church, and their sweet tones <lb/>
mingled with her day-dreams as she worked. She <lb/>
could see from thence the mysterious shades of the <lb/>
oak wood, with its Fairies' Well, whither the parish <lb/>
priest went each year to say his mass and exorcise <lb/>
evil spirits. But Jeanne did not care for fairies; <lb/>
her imagination was peopled rather with the <lb/>
persons of the saints than with the 'wee folk, <lb/>
good folk" of wood and hedgerow. While other <lb/>
village maidens sought their rustic lovers in the <lb/>
shade of the oak trees, Jeanne loved to creep to <lb/>
church, from whence in the darkness she could <lb/>
<pb n="6" entity="b000514724_0027"/>
gaze at the shining St. Michael with his uplifted <lb/>
sword, or the gentle St. Margaret with her <reg orig="con-|quering">conquering</reg> <lb/>
cross, in the painted windows, which <lb/>
became a very real part of her waking dreams. It <lb/>
was in 1424, when the Maid was twelve years of <lb/>
age, that there came to her the first hint of the <lb/>
mysterious "Voices" which were to play so <lb/>
important a part in her career.</p>
<p>She was sitting in the garden at her work that <lb/>
dreamy summer afternoon, thinking her childish <lb/>
thoughts, when suddenly there came a light "such <lb/>
as she had never seen before." And out of the <lb/>
light a Voice spake&mdash;just simple words to a simple <lb/>
little soul, but wonderful enough to her, considering <lb/>
whence they came&mdash;<hi rend="italic">"Jeanne, sois bonne et sage <lb/>
enfant; va souvent &agrave; l'&eacute;glise."</hi></p>
<p>So the call came to preparation for her high <lb/>
mission. Whether it was, as she firmly believed, <lb/>
the voice of an angel, or whether it was that still <lb/>
small voice which is ever ready to speak to the <lb/>
ready ear, does not concern us. Historians and <lb/>
ecclesiastics have investigated and weighed the <lb/>
evidence over and over again; and one can only <lb/>
marvel that those who cavil at a miraculous <reg orig="inter-|pretation">interpretation</reg> <lb/>
of the matter should so calmly accept the <lb/>
far greater miracle of Jeanne's whole career as <lb/>
warrior and leader of men.</p>
<p>Meantime, half in girlish reticence, half for fear <lb/>
of parental scoffs, she told no one of this first vision. <lb/>
But after a while the Voice spoke again; and this <lb/>
time the vision was clearer to the child's eye&mdash;but <lb/>
whether to the inward or outward vision, still we <lb/>
<pb n="7" entity="b000514724_0028"/>
know not. It took the form of a warrior, winged, <lb/>
with crown on head, who told her the sad story of <lb/>
her country and of the "pity which the angels had <lb/>
for the kingdom of France." Of this mysterious <lb/>
visitant the child says "she had great doubts <lb/>
at first whether it was St. Michael, but <reg orig="after-|wards">afterwards</reg>, <lb/>
when he had instructed her and shown <lb/>
her many things, she believed firmly that it was <lb/>
he."</p>
<p>Then he spoke yet more clearly to the wondering <lb/>
girl. "Jeanne, you must go to the help of the King <lb/>
of France, and it is you who shall give him back <lb/>
his kingdom."</p>
<p>"Messire," she answered, trembling, "I am only <lb/>
a poor girl; I cannot ride nor lead armed men." <lb/>
But the angel bade her go to the captain of <lb/>
Vaucouleurs, saying that he would take her to the <lb/>
King, and that St. Catherine and St. Margaret would <lb/>
come and help her.</p>
<p>The imperative command sank heavy on the <lb/>
heart of the little girl, but she never thought of <lb/>
disobeying. She wept bitterly at the hard task <lb/>
before her, but the gentle forms of women&mdash;St. <lb/>
Margaret and St. Catherine, she thought&mdash;came to <lb/>
comfort and strengthen her. She could never <lb/>
describe their appearance exactly, but during the <lb/>
next four years they seem to have visited her <reg orig="con-|stantly">constantly</reg>, <lb/>
so that <hi rend="italic">"Mes Voix"</hi> were her most intimate <lb/>
acquaintance. Yet we must remember that we have <lb/>
strong testimony to the fact that during this time <lb/>
Jeanne was no rapt visionary, panting for the sacred <lb/>
seclusion of convent walls; nor was she a hysterical <lb/>
<pb n="8" entity="b000514724_0029"/>
girl of highly nervous temperament, unbalanced in <lb/>
mind and unhealthy in body.</p>
<p>On the contrary, she was strong and well-made, <lb/>
knit like a boy with straight and slender limbs, and <lb/>
always ready to nurse a sick villager or help an <lb/>
overburdened mother. The only things that made <lb/>
her different from the other village girls were her <lb/>
love for churchgoing, and her absolute <reg orig="unconscious-|ness">unconsciousness</reg> <lb/>
of the love-making which generally enters so <lb/>
early into the life of a peasant maiden.</p>
<p>Quite four years seem to have elapsed between <lb/>
the first Voice and the beginning of her life-work, so <lb/>
that what at first seemed strange and terrible to the <lb/>
child became in course of time a settled habit of <lb/>
thought, a certainty for which she must be prepared <lb/>
without shrinking or doubt. The next difficulty was <lb/>
as to whom she should reveal her secret. She was <lb/>
aware by instinct of the almost certain opposition of <lb/>
those who knew her best&mdash;the father and mother to <lb/>
whom she was "petite Jeanne," a good little girl, <reg orig="some-|what">somewhat</reg> <lb/>
too much given to churchgoing and <reg orig="day-|dreaming">daydreaming</reg>. <lb/>
Yet a stranger would never understand. <lb/>
Besides, there were no strangers in Domremy.</p>
<p>Louder and louder the Voices spoke, till it seemed <lb/>
as though all the world must hear them; and then, <lb/>
just when her secret had become too much to bear <lb/>
alone in silence, there visited her home her uncle by <lb/>
marriage, good-hearted Durand Laxart, who had <lb/>
always a kind word for "petite Jeanne." Eagerly <lb/>
the girl besought him in private to take her back <lb/>
with him, on the plea that his wife wanted help. <lb/>
For he lived at Burey, close to Vaucouleurs, the <lb/>
<pb n="9" entity="b000514724_0030"/>
capital town of the district; and it was to the <lb/>
Seigneur of Vaucouleurs that Jeanne's heavenly <lb/>
visitants had ordered her to go. Leave was given, <lb/>
and the two set out along the country road together. <lb/>
Imagine the astonishment of good homely Durand <lb/>
when his young niece calmly told him "that she <lb/>
must go to the Dauphin, to make him to be crowned <lb/>
king."</p>
<p>Perhaps he stammered some astounded words of <lb/>
rebuke, for she asked him next, "Did you never hear <lb/>
that France should be made desolate by a woman and <lb/>
restored by a maid?" And he had nothing to answer.</p>
<p>From that moment Durand was her firm ally. <lb/>
To him it was quite natural that the Seigneur <lb/>
of Vaucouleurs, Robert de Baudricourt, the chief <lb/>
man of the district, should have been pointed out <lb/>
by the angel. So to the <hi rend="italic">Ch&acirc;teau</hi> he made his <lb/>
way, and with hesitating speech made known <lb/>
to the burly, downright soldier-noble his request <lb/>
that he would send a little peasant girl from <lb/>
Domremy to the Dauphin, to whom she would <lb/>
give the crown of France. We can hear the <lb/>
loud laugh and the impatient interruption of the <lb/>
Seigneur, "Box her ears and send her home to her <lb/>
mother." So Durand went back to his niece, <reg orig="down-|hearted">downhearted</reg>, <lb/>
but unshaken in his belief in her.</p>
<p>Jeanne, however, was quite unmoved by his <lb/>
account. She would see de Baudricourt herself. <lb/>
The interview must have been remarkable in many <lb/>
ways, and we can only imagine that Jeanne was <lb/>
allowed to speak as freely as she did because the <lb/>
listeners were literally speechless with astonishment. <lb/>
<pb n="10" entity="b000514724_0031"/>
A young knight was present in M. de Baudricourt's <lb/>
suite, and many years later he described her part <lb/>
of the conference thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>"She said that she came to Robert on the part of <lb/>
her Lord, that he should send her to the Dauphin, <lb/>
and tell him to hold out and have no fear, for the <lb/>
Lord would send him succour before the middle of <lb/>
Lent. She also said that France did not belong to <lb/>
the Dauphin but to her Lord; but her Lord willed <lb/>
that the Dauphin should be its king and hold it in <lb/>
command, and that in spite of her enemies she <lb/>
herself would conduct him to be consecrated. <lb/>
Robert then asked her who was this Lord. She <lb/>
answered, 'The King of Heaven.' This being done, <lb/>
she returned to her father's house with her uncle, <lb/>
Durand Laxart of Burey."</p>
<p>"She returned to her father's house." The words <lb/>
are simple enough, but they would have represented <lb/>
heartbreak for poor Jeanne had not she been upheld <lb/>
by her certainty of right. For honest Jacques, her <lb/>
father, was filled with anger at her presumption, as <lb/>
well as by an utterly mistaken notion of her motive <lb/>
and intentions. The one thing clear to his <reg orig="slow-|moving">slow-moving</reg> <lb/>
peasant mind was that his young daughter <lb/>
was about to mingle with rough soldiers and to live <lb/>
their ungodly life. He had a dream, in which he <lb/>
saw Jeanne surrounded by a company of armed <lb/>
men, and never thinking for an instant that her <lb/>
position among them might be one of command and <lb/>
not of fellowship, he told his wife next morning that <lb/>
if he could believe that the thing would happen as <lb/>
he dreamed he would wish that she would be <lb/>
<pb n="11" entity="b000514724_0032"/>
drowned; nay, would drown her with his own <lb/>
hands.</p>
<p>Her mother, woman-like, thought rather of plans <lb/>
of prevention by more natural means. Let the girl <lb/>
once get "promised" and married to an honest lad, <lb/>
and they would hear no more of dreams. A lover <lb/>
for Jeanne was not far to seek, and it was acting <lb/>
probably on the mother's suggestions that he <lb/>
brushed aside Jeanne's positive refusals, and even <lb/>
appeared before the bishop of the district, ready to <lb/>
swear that the girl had been "promised" to him <lb/>
for years. But Jeanne's unswerving testimony <lb/>
and quiet firmness soon convinced the good <lb/>
bishop; so that she returned to the village, <lb/>
freed from her troublesome suitor indeed, but still <lb/>
face to face with the anger and suspicion of her <lb/>
father.</p>
<p>Wearily the long winter months passed on. <lb/>
Only the reminder of her "Voices" and the approach <lb/>
of Lent, the appointed date of deliverance, sustained <lb/>
her. For by this time all doubt and scruples as to <lb/>
her duty had passed away.</p>
<p>In the January of 1429 Jeanne left her home for <lb/>
the last time, and set out once more with her uncle <lb/>
for Vaucouleurs. Her interviews with the Seigneur <lb/>
were now on a quite different plane. The good <lb/>
man was puzzled and suspicious, but he no longer <lb/>
mocked. His only interpretation of the mystery <lb/>
was that Jeanne must be a witch and possessed of <lb/>
evil spirits. Therefore, when the girl was safely <lb/>
installed in the humble home of a carter and his <lb/>
wife, he brought the <hi rend="italic">cur&eacute;</hi> to inspect her; and the <lb/>
<pb n="12" entity="b000514724_0033"/>
priest, dressed in full vestments, solemnly exorcised <lb/>
the Evil One, supposed to inhabit Jeanne's innocent <lb/>
young body. But nothing happened, save that the <lb/>
Maid smiled outright at such a proceeding on the <lb/>
part of one who had heard her confession and <lb/>
seen her daily at mass during her sojourn at <lb/>
Vaucouleurs.</p>
<p>Meantime, as in the days of old in the case of <lb/>
another Deliverer, the common people heard her <lb/>
gladly. And then one day there passed by the <lb/>
porch where she sat sewing, a bonny young noble, <lb/>
who, having heard the story, asked mockingly, <lb/>
"What are you doing here, <hi rend="italic">ma mie?</hi> Will you let <lb/>
the King be driven out of his kingdom, and are we <lb/>
all to be made English?"</p>
<p>But the Maid answered with quiet dignity, <lb/>
"Robert de Baudricourt will have none of me or my <lb/>
words; nevertheless, before Mid-Lent I must be with <lb/>
the King, if I should wear my feet up to my knees; <lb/>
for nobody in the world, be it king, duke, or the <lb/>
King of Scotland's daughter, can save the kingdom <lb/>
of France save me alone; though I would rather spin <lb/>
beside my poor mother, and this is not my work: but <lb/>
I must go and do it, because my Seigneur so wills it."</p>
<p>"And who is your Seigneur?" he asked, <reg orig="wonder-|ing">wondering</reg> <lb/>
and half convinced.</p>
<p>"He is God," was her reply.</p>
<p>The mockery of Jean de Metz fell off him like a <lb/>
garment. He held out his hands, and clasping those <lb/>
of the Maid, swore a solemn oath that he himself <lb/>
would conduct her to the Dauphin.</p>
<p>"When will you set out?" he asked; and she <lb/>
<pb n="13" entity="b000514724_0034"/>
answered promptly, "Rather to-day than <reg orig="to-|morrow">to-morrow</reg>."</p>
<p>So hasty preparations were made; and while de <lb/>
Baudricourt awaited the return of a messenger to <lb/>
Chinon, announcing the King's will on this matter, <lb/>
young Jean de Metz and his friend de Poulengy, <lb/>
who had been present at Jeanne's first interview with <lb/>
the Seigneur, did all in their power to hasten <reg orig="pro-|ceedings">proceedings</reg>.</p>
<p>For many reasons Jeanne determined to put <lb/>
aside her ordinary dress, and to put on instead the <lb/>
clothes of a boy. De Metz provided her with this, <lb/>
as well as with a breastplate and a certain amount of <lb/>
armour; de Baudricourt gave her a sword, the <reg orig="towns-|folk">townsfolk</reg> <lb/>
subscribed to buy her a horse. But meantime <lb/>
the soul of the girl was harassed by her parents' <lb/>
treatment. Angry commands for her immediate <lb/>
return, threats of a father's curse, followed hard upon <lb/>
one another, and Jeanne began to realise that her <lb/>
first step on her path of deliverance involved the <lb/>
loss of all family ties&mdash;all save one, indeed, for later <lb/>
on we hear of a young brother, Pierre d'Arc, leaving <lb/>
his father's house to fight under the banner of his <lb/>
sister.</p>
<p>So at length the little cavalcade was ready to <lb/>
start from the gate of the <hi rend="italic">Ch&acirc;teau</hi> of Vaucouleurs&mdash; <lb/>
Jean de Metz, his friend de Poulengy, each with his <lb/>
body-servant, the King's messenger and his archers, <lb/>
and Jeanne in the midst.</p>
<p>"Go, and let what will happen!" cried de <reg orig="Baudri-|court">Baudricourt</reg>, <lb/>
still but half convinced; but his words were <lb/>
lost in the sudden outcry made by a woman of the <lb/>
<pb n="14" entity="b000514724_0035"/>
crowd, who, overcome by the sight of the youth and <lb/>
helplessness of the Maid, called out a question as to <lb/>
how she dared face such unknown dangers. "It <lb/>
was for that I was born," called Jeanne in reply; <lb/>
and so they rode away.</p>
<p>That was a strange journey. The growing <lb/>
familiarity of the little party with one another <lb/>
inevitably led to some chilly doubts as to whether <lb/>
after all the two young noblemen were not making <lb/>
themselves ridiculous by their errand. Perhaps <lb/>
they gave some hint of this, for presently we find <lb/>
Jeanne reassuring them, telling them that her <lb/>
"brothers in Paradise" would tell her how to act <lb/>
when the time came, and that for the past five years <lb/>
they had told her to go to the war and save the <lb/>
kingdom of France. Her perfect confidence <reg orig="im-|pressed">impressed</reg> <lb/>
them most of all, and they stood abashed <lb/>
when she bade them not fear the bold Burgundians <lb/>
in the path, for that she was bound to go unhurt <lb/>
into the presence of the King.</p>
<p>When at length they reached Chinon, there was <lb/>
a delay of two days before the careless, <reg orig="pleasure-|seeking">pleasure-seeking</reg> <lb/>
young Dauphin would grant her an audience. <lb/>
It might indeed have been of much longer duration <lb/>
had not a hope of some diversion, some amusement <lb/>
in the midst of the <hi rend="italic">ennui</hi> of the Court, awakened <lb/>
curiosity on Jeanne's account. She was summoned <lb/>
to the great Chamber, filled to overflowing with <lb/>
richly dressed nobles, among whom Charles mixed <lb/>
freely, conspicuous neither by dress nor manner, as <lb/>
the Maid approached. But Jeanne never hesitated. <lb/>
In her travel-stained boy's garb, with features drawn <lb/>
<pb n="15" entity="b000514724_0036"/>
a little from fatigue, she walked straight up to the <lb/>
Dauphin, and kneeling, said, "Gentle Prince, God <lb/>
give you good life!"</p>
<p>"But there is the King, over yonder," cried <lb/>
Charles teasingly.</p>
<p>"Gentle Dauphin, it is you and no other," said the <lb/>
girl, rising and facing him with quiet determination; <lb/>
and then she delivered her message. "My Prince, I <lb/>
am Jeanne the Maid. I am sent to you by the King <lb/>
of Heaven to tell you that you shall be consecrated <lb/>
and crowned at Rheims, and shall be lieutenant of <lb/>
the King of Heaven, who is King of France."</p>
<p>Greatly moved in spite of himself, the Prince <lb/>
drew her aside into a recess and closely questioned <lb/>
her. But her replies were always the same. "My <lb/>
Lord has sent me to conduct you to Rheims that <lb/>
you may be crowned&mdash;<hi rend="italic">if you will</hi>."</p>
<p>Charles VII. was a poor creature, weak of will, <reg orig="in-|firm">infirm</reg> <lb/>
of purpose, but all that was noble in him must <lb/>
have been stirred by those simple, convincing words.</p>
<p>A trying experience followed. From the first <lb/>
Jeanne had always two parties against her&mdash;the <lb/>
ecclesiastics and the military commanders of that <lb/>
day. To the first of these Jeanne was now <reg orig="sub-|mitted">submitted</reg> <lb/>
for cross-examination as to the nature and <lb/>
reality of her visions. This was tiresome enough, <lb/>
but she held her own most valiantly, till suddenly <lb/>
the friar who was conducting the long and wearisome <lb/>
discussion said, "Words are all very well, but God <lb/>
would not have us believe you unless you show us <lb/>
some sign."</p>
<p>Then the girl's temper blazed righteously forth.</p>
<pb n="16" entity="b000514724_0037"/>
<p>"I have not come here to give signs," she cried. <lb/>
"Take me to Orleans&mdash;I will there show the signs I <lb/>
am sent to show. Give me as small a band as you <lb/>
please, but let me go."</p>
<p>So they were forced to come to a decision, and as <lb/>
the chronicle tells us&mdash;</p>
<p>"After hearing all these reports, the King taking <lb/>
into consideration the great goodness that was in <lb/>
the Maid, and that she declared herself to be sent <lb/>
by God, it was by the said Seigneur and his Council <lb/>
determined that from henceforward he should make <lb/>
use of her for his wars, since it was for this that she <lb/>
was sent."</p>
<p>So Jeanne proceeded, with a little body-guard, <lb/>
towards Orleans. She was better equipped now <lb/>
than at her first start. She had been presented <lb/>
with a suit of armour inlaid with silver, but she wore <lb/>
no helmet, and her girlish head rose up from the <lb/>
glittering gorget in curious contrast to the warlike <lb/>
mail. Her standard was of white linen, with a <lb/>
silken fringe and an embroidered figure of the Christ <lb/>
with the round earth in His hands, an adoring angel <lb/>
on either side. The Dauphin would have given her <lb/>
a costly sword, but Jeanne would have neither that <lb/>
nor the commoner one given her by de Baudricourt. <lb/>
She had noted, on her march to Chinon, that a <lb/>
knight's tomb stood behind the high altar of the <lb/>
church of St. Catherine where she had heard mass. <lb/>
St. Catherine was her patron&mdash;it was from her the <lb/>
sword should come. So she gave orders that a <lb/>
sword which would be found in that tomb should be <lb/>
brought to her; and it was duly exhumed, cleaned, <lb/>
<pb n="17" entity="b000514724_0038"/>
and, when it had been adorned with a scabbard <lb/>
of crimson velvet broidered with the lilies of France, <lb/>
was placed in her hand.</p>
<p>But before she set out she wrote to the English <lb/>
generals at Orleans a letter charming in its simple <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">na&iuml;vet&eacute;</hi>, bidding them "give back to the Maid who <lb/>
is here sent on the part of God the King of Heaven, <lb/>
the keys of all the good towns which you have taken <lb/>
by violence in His France." We can but imagine <lb/>
the astonishment not unmingled with blasphemy <lb/>
with which such a document would be received by <lb/>
the rough English commanders!</p>
<p>So the little army began their march, with their <lb/>
young leader at the head in her shining array. She <lb/>
had already worked upon the minds of the soldiers, <lb/>
so that they dared not utter an oath nor swear <lb/>
by anything stronger than a <hi rend="italic">b&acirc;ton</hi>. Crosses and <lb/>
banners gleamed in the air, mass was sung by the <lb/>
attendant chaplains wherever possible, psalms were <lb/>
chanted &mdash; it was all more like a procession of <lb/>
religion than of warfare. But there were enemies <lb/>
already in the camp, who led the girl away from <lb/>
the English forts which surrounded Orleans on one <lb/>
side of the Loire, which she wished to attack at <lb/>
once. They could not cross, however, and had to <lb/>
retrace their steps, while Jeanne openly reproached <lb/>
them for not obeying her command. The English, <lb/>
however, offered no opposition, and towards evening <lb/>
the Maid, riding on her white horse through the <lb/>
gathering twilight, entered Orleans.</p>
<p>The relief of Orleans reads like some wonderful <lb/>
story of romance. The city had been barely <lb/>
<pb n="18" entity="b000514724_0039"/>
holding out against the English beleaguers for <lb/>
many months. Some of the finest soldiers in France <lb/>
were within its walls, and had little hope of eventual <lb/>
success; for the English were too strong, their <reg orig="forti-|fications">fortifications</reg> <lb/>
quite impregnable. To them enters a <lb/>
young peasant girl who had never seen a siege in her <lb/>
life. She disregards all their plans and man&oelig;uvres, <lb/>
and calmly exposing herself to the shots of the <lb/>
enemy, stands upon the walls and bids the English <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">"Retournez de la par Dieu &agrave; l'Angleterre."</hi> They <lb/>
answer her with a shout of vile abuse, and she weeps <lb/>
for her insulted womanhood. What a leader is <lb/>
this for greybeards, old in the service of their <lb/>
King!</p>
<p>But that afternoon, when her own men were off <lb/>
their guard and she was fast asleep, the French <lb/>
generals made a secret sortie, and were badly beaten. <lb/>
None knew it in the city, but the Maid, springing <lb/>
from her couch, cried, "The blood of our soldiers is <lb/>
flowing! Why did they not tell me? To arms! <lb/>
To arms!"</p>
<p>She sent her page flying for her horse, while the <lb/>
men-at-arms stared stupidly at one another. Then, <lb/>
as they began to stir, she flashed past them on <lb/>
her white charger, waving her gleaming banner. <lb/>
Hurriedly they scrambled after her, meeting the <lb/>
fugitive troop in full flight outside the gate, on and <lb/>
on, in a breathless rush towards the bastille, upon <lb/>
which the party from Orleans had made such a futile <lb/>
attack, and being joined by Dunois, the Signeur of <lb/>
Orleans, who had till now treated Jeanne with scorn, <lb/>
they flung themselves upon the fort. For hours <lb/>
<pb n="19" entity="b000514724_0040"/>
the fight lasted, and all that time the banner of the <lb/>
Maid gleamed in the forefront of the battle, as she <lb/>
rode to and fro shouting, encouraging&mdash;ay, and <lb/>
weeping too, for the blood she saw so freely shed. <lb/>
But at vesper-tide the fort was taken, and the first <lb/>
triumph of the Maid was achieved.</p>
<p>Again and again we hear the same story. The <lb/>
old warriors of France would plot and counterplot <lb/>
against her, but always she would get her way, and <lb/>
that was invariably the way to victory.</p>
<p>In one of these breathless sorties she received her <lb/>
first wound. The arrow-head "stood a <reg orig="hand-|breadth">hand-breadth</reg> <lb/>
out behind the shoulder"&mdash;an alarming <lb/>
adventure, even though it was a mere flesh wound. <lb/>
She pulled out the shaft herself, and then, girl-like, <lb/>
wept at sight of the blood that followed it, and <lb/>
thought herself about to die after the wound was <lb/>
dressed. But a mention of sounding the retreat <lb/>
acted like a tonic. She managed to get on her <lb/>
horse, and cried to her generals, "Rest and refresh <lb/>
yourselves a little, I pray you; and when you see <lb/>
my standard touch the wall, forward! the place is <lb/>
yours."</p>
<p>With her own hand she bore it to the edge of the <lb/>
moat and placed it against the wall. What could <lb/>
the troops do, weary and disheartened though they <lb/>
might be, than rise to the occasion, dash at the wall, <lb/>
and swarm up it "as if it had been a stair," says <lb/>
one astonished eye-witness. "Do they think <lb/>
themselves immortal?" cried their thunderstruck <lb/>
opponents, as they gazed on that white figure by <lb/>
the wall, round whom the arrows whiz in vain. <lb/>
<pb n="20" entity="b000514724_0041"/>
Their leader and his troop are driven into the river <lb/>
and sink. The Maid remembers his ill words to <lb/>
her, and behold! she weeps. "I have great pity on <lb/>
thy soul," she cries. And so, within eight days, she <lb/>
drives the English from the south bank of the river, <lb/>
and Orleans, the key of Southern France, is safe <lb/>
after a siege of seven long months.</p>
<p>As soon as possible after the siege had fallen <lb/>
Jeanne hastened to the King and bade him make <lb/>
his way to Rheims for his coronation. But the <lb/>
Court gave her more trouble than the English <lb/>
had done. In vain she cried from the tedious <reg orig="ante-|chamber">antechamber</reg> <lb/>
to which she was relegated during <lb/>
the councils held by the King's advisers, "I shall <lb/>
only last a year; take the good of me as long as <lb/>
it is possible."</p>
<p>Undue caution, frivolous excuses, foolish intrigues <lb/>
were the order of the day. At length the Maid <lb/>
would endure it no longer. Marching boldly to <lb/>
the door of the council-chamber, she gave her <lb/>
vigorous young knock, and being admitted, knelt <lb/>
at the King's feet, crying, "Noble Dauphin, why <lb/>
do you hold such long councils? Come to Rheims <lb/>
rather, and receive your worthy crown!"</p>
<p>We must pass quickly over the subsequent events <lb/>
&mdash;how Charles graciously promised to set out <lb/>
directly the way was clear of the English; how <lb/>
Jeanne undertook to drive them from his path; <lb/>
and how town after town fell before her victorious <lb/>
banner. No wonder that Bedford, the English <lb/>
regent of France, wrote word to England that <lb/>
the failure of his men was "caused in great part <lb/>
<pb n="21" entity="b000514724_0042"/>
by the fatal faith and vain fear that the French <lb/>
had of a servant of the Enemy of Man called the <lb/>
Maid, who used many false enchantments and <lb/>
witchcraft, by which not only is the number <lb/>
of our soldiers diminished but their courage <lb/>
marvellously beaten down, and the boldness of <lb/>
our enemies increased." And all the while the <lb/>
Maid, while urging on her men to fight, "has <lb/>
great pity" on the English souls. Once indeed <lb/>
we see her sitting on the ground, nursing the <lb/>
head of an unfortunate English soldier who had <lb/>
been brutally ill-used by a Frenchman while in <lb/>
the act of surrender.</p>
<p>And then at length the Dauphin set out for <lb/>
Rheims. Even then there was a long delay before <lb/>
the city of Troyes while the King's councillors <lb/>
debated whether to pass it by or to take it from <lb/>
the English. The army was all on Jeanne's side, <lb/>
of course. That allegiance never wavered. But <lb/>
the King, as usual, could not decide how to act. <lb/>
Once again did Jeanne in desperation knock at <lb/>
the door of the council-chamber, where she was <lb/>
met by the Archbishop of Rheims. "Jeanne," <lb/>
said he, "the King and his Council are in great <lb/>
perplexity to know what they should do."</p>
<p>"Shall I be believed if I speak?" asked the <lb/>
girl.</p>
<p>"I cannot tell," answered the King for himself, <lb/>
"though if you say things that are reasonable and <lb/>
profitable, I shall certainly believe you."</p>
<p>"Shall I be believed?" she said once more.</p>
<p>"Yes," said the King, "according as you speak."</p>
<pb n="22" entity="b000514724_0043"/>
<p>"Noble Dauphin," replied the Maid, "order your <lb/>
folk to assault the city of Troyes, and to hold no more <lb/>
councils; for, by my God, in three days I will bring <lb/>
you into the town of Troyes, by love or by force, <lb/>
and false Burgundy shall be dismayed."</p>
<p>"Jeanne," interposed the Chancellor, "if you could <lb/>
do that in <hi rend="italic">six</hi> days, we might well wait."</p>
<p>"You shall be master of the place," said the <lb/>
Maid to the King, "not in six days but to-morrow."</p>
<p>It was as she had said. The exciting and <lb/>
heroic scenes pass swiftly by, and always it is <lb/>
Jeanne's white figure in the forefront, Jeanne who <lb/>
leads them on to victory. It was after the last town <lb/>
on the road to Rheims had fallen, that a small band <lb/>
of folk from her own Domremy made their way to <lb/>
Troyes to catch a glimpse of their little village <lb/>
friend, who now led armies and rode by the side of <lb/>
the King. They crowded round her wondering and <lb/>
admiring. "Had she no fear of arrow or bullet?" <lb/>
they asked. "I fear nought but treason," replied <lb/>
the Maid; and her answer gives a sad foreboding of <lb/>
what was to come.</p>
<p>It was on July 17, 1429, that the great event <lb/>
for which Jeanne had toiled actually took place, <lb/>
and Charles was crowned at Rheims. That was a <lb/>
wonderful day. While the highest peers of France <lb/>
went in solemn procession to fetch from its shrine <lb/>
the sacred oil for the anointing, Jeanne was busy <lb/>
dictating a letter&mdash;one of her usual forcible, <reg orig="down-|right">downright</reg> <lb/>
epistles&mdash;to the great Duke of Burgundy, <lb/>
bidding him give up his league with the English and <lb/>
join hands with his cousin of France. Then, dressed <lb/>
<pb n="23" entity="b000514724_0044"/>
in her armour, she went to take her place among <lb/>
the peers of France, watching with anxious eyes the <lb/>
actual ceremony, as the King knelt to receive his <lb/>
crown under the shade of her white banner of <lb/>
victory.</p>
<p>Immediately after the anointing, she broke from <lb/>
the pressing throng around her and flung herself at <lb/>
the feet of the King, with tears streaming down her <lb/>
face. "Gentle King," she cried, "now is the pleasure <lb/>
of God fulfilled, whose will it was that I should <lb/>
raise the siege of Orleans and lead you to this city <lb/>
of Rheims to receive your consecration. Now has <lb/>
He shown that you are true King, and that the <lb/>
kingdom of France truly belongs to you alone." <lb/>
And then with choking sobs she begged him to send <lb/>
her back to her mother and the home in little <lb/>
Domremy.</p>
<p>But this could not be. The Maid was far too <lb/>
useful, too precious to let go. So her father and <lb/>
uncle, who had come to Rheims to see the great <lb/>
sight, returned alone, and Jeanne tearfully remained <lb/>
behind. She had said truly that her work, as far <lb/>
as victory was concerned, was over. From that <lb/>
moment of supreme accomplishment dated her <lb/>
failure and her fall. She had always been unpopular <lb/>
with the councillors of the King, and now their <lb/>
jealousy changed to malignant hate. Little by little <lb/>
she realised, partly from signs only too apparent, <lb/>
partly from the forebodings roused by her mysterious <lb/>
"Voices," that some disaster was in store for her. <lb/>
No longer did her heavenly visitants direct her as <lb/>
of old. "Fear not, for God is with you," was their <lb/>
<pb n="24" entity="b000514724_0045"/>
message; but when she sought for the plain <reg orig="com-|mands">commands</reg> <lb/>
issued of old as to her steps, they were dumb.</p>
<p>Paris, the capital of Northern France, the <lb/>
Anglicised town of Paris, now became the object of <lb/>
Jeanne's attack.</p>
<p>Bedford had already been heard to say that the <lb/>
city would fall at a blow if the Maid came on at <lb/>
once; but immediate action was impossible where <lb/>
Charles VII. was concerned.</p>
<p>Intrigue, not war, was ever his preference; and <lb/>
now, to the blank horror of Jeanne, a league was <lb/>
made with Burgundy, the friend of England, the foe <lb/>
of France, whose promise to deliver up the city <lb/>
within a fortnight deceived not even the weak and <lb/>
foolish King.</p>
<p>Indignantly the girl sends a letter to the men of <lb/>
Rheims, who had sent to know why she delayed to <lb/>
march upon the capital.</p>
<p>"Dear and good friends," she says, "good and <lb/>
loyal Frenchmen of the town of Rheims, Jeanne <lb/>
the Maid sends you news of her. It is true that <lb/>
the King has made a truce of fifteen days with the <lb/>
Duke of Burgundy, who promises to render <reg orig="peace-|ably">peaceably</reg> <lb/>
the city of Paris in that time. Do not, <reg orig="how-|ever">however</reg>, <lb/>
be surprised if I enter there sooner; for I like <lb/>
not truces so made, and know not whether I will <lb/>
keep them, but if I do, it will be only because of the <lb/>
honour of the King."</p>
<p>Alas for these brave words! The league was <lb/>
kept with Burgundy, but Paris was not surrendered, <lb/>
and its assault by the dauntless Maid was one of the <lb/>
terrible failures of history. Throughout that ill-fated <lb/>
<pb n="25" entity="b000514724_0046"/>
day, her high voice shouts her battle-cry, <hi rend="italic">"Renty! <lb/>
Renty!</hi> &lpar;surrender! surrender!&rpar; to the King of <lb/>
France!" amid a storm of arrows and foul words <lb/>
from the walls above. For six long hours she stands <lb/>
upon the edge of the moat, cheering on her men. <lb/>
But at nightfall she was forced by some of her <lb/>
officers to return to the camp. <hi rend="italic">"Quel dommage! <lb/>
Quel dommage!"</hi> she cries again and again. "Why <lb/>
did they not go on till morning?" For she had <lb/>
promised the soldiers that they should sleep in Paris <lb/>
that night, and for the first time their faith in her <lb/>
is shaken.</p>
<p>And next day a peremptory message comes from <lb/>
the King: they are to return&mdash;to leave Paris <reg orig="un-|conquered">unconquered</reg>. <lb/>
It was a fatal policy; but Jeanne, no <lb/>
longer sure of the loyalty of her men-at-arms, dared <lb/>
not disobey. Sorrowfully she laid her worn armour <lb/>
on the altar of the cathedral of St. Denis, at which <lb/>
city the army lay. The act was an emblem of her <lb/>
approaching fate.</p>
<p>Months of wearisome inaction followed, in a Court <lb/>
whose flippant life and purposeless amusement must <lb/>
have been hateful to the downright Jeanne. She <lb/>
still loved to go to church, and she was kindly <reg orig="dis-|posed">disposed</reg> <lb/>
towards the ladies who thronged around her; <lb/>
for Jeanne was always a favourite with her own sex <lb/>
When at length she faced the battlefield once more, <lb/>
fresh disasters came about; and when she returned <lb/>
to the Court she found that they had set up there a <lb/>
rival "visionary," one Catherine, who as the <reg orig="mouth-|piece">mouthpiece</reg> <lb/>
of Jeanne's enemies was always ready to <lb/>
oppose and contradict her.</p>
<pb n="26" entity="b000514724_0047"/>
<p>These things must have weighed sorely upon the <lb/>
girl's mind. Nearly seventy years later it was <lb/>
recorded by two old men, who were children at that <lb/>
time, that on one occasion, when the morning mass <lb/>
was over in the church of Compi&egrave;gne, which she <lb/>
was visiting, she uprose against a pillar and said to <lb/>
those who stood around her, "Dear friends and <lb/>
children, I have to tell you that I have been sold <lb/>
and betrayed, and will soon be given up to death. <lb/>
I beg of you to pray for me; for soon I shall no <lb/>
longer have any power to serve the King and the <lb/>
kingdom."</p>
<p>Her Voices had said "before the Saint-Jean" &lpar;June <lb/>
24&rpar; she should be "taken"; but it was on the 23rd <lb/>
of May that the fatal moment arrived. In her <lb/>
absence from Compi&egrave;gne the town had been closely <lb/>
invested, and on hearing this she hastened to the <lb/>
aid of her <hi rend="italic">"bons amis"</hi> in the city. She made her <lb/>
usual triumphant arrival, and at once arranged to <lb/>
make a sortie in the evening, and to attack the <lb/>
Burgundian bands which were coming to the aid of <lb/>
the English.</p>
<p>This was done; but the rearguard of her little <lb/>
army, finding the latter were nearer than they <lb/>
reckoned, were seized with panic, and fled back to <lb/>
the city, whose gates were hastily closed upon the <lb/>
pursuing enemy and those who had not managed <lb/>
to get inside. Of this Jeanne, riding with the <lb/>
vanguard, knew nothing, and it was with the utmost <lb/>
difficulty that she was induced to turn back when <lb/>
the mishap became known. They reached the city <lb/>
just as the gates had been closed, and thus came <lb/>
<pb n="27" entity="b000514724_0048"/>
full upon the forces of the enemy, hopelessly mixed <lb/>
up with a struggling band of fugitives from their <lb/>
own troops. There was no hope of escape, for the <lb/>
Maid was conspicuous in her gold-embroidered cloak <lb/>
even in the twilight. A mad rush followed, and <lb/>
almost at once she was surrounded and dragged <lb/>
from her horse.</p>
<p>High above the yells of exultation of her <lb/>
Burgundian captors rang out the bells of Compi&egrave;gne, <lb/>
sounding all too late a rally for the deliverance of the <lb/>
Maid of France. Nothing could be done; and so <lb/>
Jeanne disappears into the darkness of the Burgundian <lb/>
camp.</p>
<p>In that terrible hour no man stood forth as her <lb/>
champion. The Burgundians and the English <reg orig="re-|joiced">rejoiced</reg> <lb/>
together with exceeding joy, bonfires blazed <lb/>
at Paris, and Charles the King turned for a fresh <lb/>
diversion to a charlatan from the hills, a shepherd <lb/>
lad who was to take Jeanne's place. In the whole <lb/>
of France not a blow was struck, not a voice was <lb/>
raised on her behalf. But instead, the University of <lb/>
Paris, thronged by learned ecclesiastics, at once <lb/>
denounced her as a heretic, and set all its forces to <lb/>
work to condemn this one young girl to a shameful <lb/>
death.</p>
<p>Meantime Jeanne was fretting her heart out in <lb/>
Burgundy's castle of Beaurevoir for the fate of the <lb/>
people of Compi&egrave;gne. Helpless and wild with <reg orig="im-|patience">impatience</reg> <lb/>
at her imprisonment, she forgot to listen to <lb/>
her Voices as of old, but in one mad bid for liberty <lb/>
flung herself down from the battlements, from a <lb/>
height of sixty feet. So light and flexible was her <lb/>
<pb n="28" entity="b000514724_0049"/>
young frame that it survived the shock; and though <lb/>
for three days she lay stunned and speechless, she <lb/>
quickly recovered.</p>
<p>The next act of the tragedy in which Jeanne <lb/>
played her part is one which reflects dishonour most <lb/>
upon the name of Burgundy. With shameful <reg orig="frank-|ness">frankness</reg>, <lb/>
the Maid was sold to the English, and her <lb/>
Burgundian captors received the money that was the <lb/>
price of blood. Yet Jeanne, as a prisoner of war, had <lb/>
the right of ransom&mdash;a fact which never seemed to <lb/>
have entered the minds of those who held her <lb/>
captive or of her own countrymen.</p>
<p>The English, in their joy at the downfall of her <lb/>
who had so lately been their destruction, treated the <lb/>
poor child with a cruelty no less absurd than <lb/>
exaggerated. They took her to Rouen, and placed <lb/>
her, until her trial, in an iron cage, where her hands, <lb/>
feet, and throat were bound to a pillar, and where <lb/>
she was never free from the watch of the coarse <lb/>
English soldiers. One would have thought it was <lb/>
some wild savage beast whom they held in check <lb/>
rather than a slight young girl.</p>
<p>When her trial began, the cage disappeared, but <lb/>
still they kept her chained by one foot during both <lb/>
day and night. The terrible strain of the long <lb/>
trial was increased at night by the brutality <lb/>
of the soldiers, who in cruel jest would wake her <lb/>
from her sleep of exhaustion to tell her that she <lb/>
had been condemned and was to be executed at <lb/>
once.</p>
<p>Then the trial itself was calculated to shake the <lb/>
strongest nerve. Against the young peasant girl <lb/>
<pb n="29" entity="b000514724_0050"/>
were arrayed all the keenest intellects and most subtle <lb/>
theologians of France, full of prejudice against one <lb/>
who had presumed to see and hear what had been <lb/>
hidden from the wise. Behind them, more silent <lb/>
but more terrible in their implacable hatred, stood <lb/>
the band of English generals who had lost honour <lb/>
and renown in her victorious attack. Such men as <lb/>
Winchester, who had refused to move his army, <lb/>
fresh landed at Calais, a step towards Paris, "for fear <lb/>
of the Maid," or as Bedford, who had watched the <lb/>
siege of Orleans from afar, now stood grimly by, <lb/>
watching every movement lest their prey should <lb/>
escape. And Jeanne stood alone against them all, <lb/>
without a friend, without the old clear commands <lb/>
from her heavenly Voices to comfort her, yet full <lb/>
of spirit, clear-headed, steadfast as of old.</p>
<p>The great aim of her foes was to prove that she <lb/>
had performed her deeds of valour by the help of <lb/>
sorcery and witchcraft, and in order to get evidence <lb/>
on this point they made a vile plot, by which a spy, <lb/>
pretending to be from the neighbourhood of <lb/>
Domremy, visited her and questioned her about the <lb/>
days of her early girlhood. At two peepholes of <lb/>
her prison were stationed English nobles, who <lb/>
stooped to such a trick in their efforts to ensnare the <lb/>
innocent girl. But though Jeanne was completely <lb/>
deceived, she had nothing to betray. Discovering, <lb/>
indeed, that her fellow-countryman was a priest, she <lb/>
gladly made her confession to him; and as the <lb/>
simple, earnest avowal was heard, one can but <lb/>
hope that a spark of shame touched the hard <lb/>
hearts of those who strove in vain to find some <lb/>
<pb n="30" entity="b000514724_0051"/>
fault in her. They now fell back upon the charge <lb/>
of heresy.</p>
<p>Through all these harassing weeks, never left <lb/>
alone, tortured by inquisitive visitors and brutal <lb/>
tricks, the Maid was even deserted for a while by <lb/>
her hope of ultimate freedom. When her Burgundian <lb/>
captor, visiting her, said mockingly, "Jeanne, I will <lb/>
have you ransomed if you will promise never to bear <lb/>
arms against us again," she answered sadly, "It <lb/>
is well for you to jest, but I know you have no such <lb/>
power. I know that the English will kill me, <lb/>
believing that after I am dead they will be able to <lb/>
win all the kingdom of France; but if there were a <lb/>
hundred thousand more than there are, they shall <lb/>
never win the kingdom of France." The Englishman <lb/>
by whom he was accompanied raised his dagger to <lb/>
strike the girl for her brave words; but her gaoler, <lb/>
Lord Warwick, prevented him. Not by so speedy <lb/>
and merciful a death was Jeanne the Maid to <lb/>
die.</p>
<p>It was on the 21st of February 1431 that <lb/>
Jeanne's public examination began. We must not <lb/>
linger over the details of the long process. We can <lb/>
picture the Maid in her shabby boy's tunic and hose, <lb/>
with cropped hair and pale, worn face, answering <lb/>
wearily but steadily the searching questions about <lb/>
her early life and surroundings, and replying with <lb/>
simple faith to the learned priests who tried so hard <lb/>
to entrap her into some admission of heresy. Little <lb/>
by little the gentle story of her village-life was drawn <lb/>
from her&mdash;a story which might well have softened <lb/>
any but the most prejudiced heart, and which, in a <lb/>
<pb n="31" entity="b000514724_0052"/>
kind of autobiography, forms the groundwork of all <lb/>
the lives of the Maid written since that day.</p>
<p>Its simplicity and its evident ring of truth seems <lb/>
to have made some impression, for the Bishop of <lb/>
Beauvais, her most implacable enemy, suddenly <lb/>
made an end of the public trial, and proclaimed that <lb/>
the rest of the examination would be held privately <lb/>
in the prison. He had marked with darkened <lb/>
countenance the occasional cries of "Well said!" <lb/>
from the onlookers, had even heard an impetuous <lb/>
English knight cry, "Why was not this brave girl <lb/>
an Englishwoman?" and now a certain lawyer had <lb/>
come forward openly to declare the trial altogether <lb/>
illegal for want of witnesses and advocates on the <lb/>
prisoner's side. The rest of the nefarious business <lb/>
must be huddled away into seclusion.</p>
<p>So the long days of mental torture and suspense <lb/>
still dragged on; only now there was not even the <lb/>
encouragement of a stranger from the crowd. Yet <lb/>
the Maid did not falter. Her dread of death, indeed, <lb/>
seems to have passed away; for her Voices spoke of <lb/>
coming deliverance, and she still held to the hope <lb/>
that some of the brave generals of her beloved <lb/>
France were nigh at hand&mdash;delayed for some <reg orig="un-|known">unknown</reg> <lb/>
reason, but ready and eager to come to set <lb/>
her free. Only this touching belief in those who <lb/>
had betrayed and deserted her accounts for her <lb/>
wonderful pluck and the spirit with which she <lb/>
answered the wearisome, pointless questions.</p>
<p>Thus when they asked her if it were true that her <lb/>
standard had been carried into the cathedral at <lb/>
Rheims when those of other leaders were excluded, <lb/>
<pb n="32" entity="b000514724_0053"/>
she flashed forth the answer, "It had been through <lb/>
the labour and the pain: there was good reason <lb/>
that it should have the honour." But we catch a <lb/>
hint of chill foreboding in the poor girl's pitiful <lb/>
request, when, on being bullied and questioned anew <lb/>
as to why she wore man's dress, she answered that <lb/>
she must not yet give it up, but that, if she were to <lb/>
be undressed and led out for execution, she prayed <lb/>
that they would give her a long woman's chemise; <lb/>
and when they asked further why she should want <lb/>
this in which to die, though she had lived in men's <lb/>
garb, she answered with faltering breath, "It is <lb/>
enough that it should be long."</p>
<p>Poor little Jeanne! Already the shadow of the <lb/>
stake falls on her, and worse than the leaping flames <lb/>
she dreads the bold gaze of brutal men upon her <lb/>
innocent, helpless form. It is small wonder that she <lb/>
broke down at length in health, and for a fortnight, <lb/>
chained to her bed, tossed to and fro in misery. <lb/>
Even then they would not leave her in peace, for <lb/>
the Bishop of Beauvais visited her and harassed her <lb/>
afresh.</p>
<p>In vain she begged to be allowed the Sacraments. <lb/>
They were sternly forbidden to this devout young <lb/>
daughter of Holy Church.</p>
<p>At length the trial came to an end. They had <lb/>
tried to force her to deny her visions, to confess <lb/>
herself an impostor, but to no effect. "What I have <lb/>
always said, I maintain to this moment," was, in the <lb/>
prison, her unmoved and final response.</p>
<p>But the Maid was, after all, a very human girl of <lb/>
eighteen; and when they led her forth, one bright <lb/>
<pb n="33" entity="b000514724_0054"/>
May morning, and showed her the high scaffold and <lb/>
the stake at which she was to die unless she <lb/>
"abjured," when they preached at her and bullied <lb/>
her anew, when sympathetic bystanders called <lb/>
on her to save herself from the burning, she <lb/>
gave way. "At the end of the sentence, Jeanne, <lb/>
fearing the fire, said she would obey the Church," <lb/>
&mdash;so runs the description of the clerk who saw <lb/>
these things.</p>
<p>We can see what happened. The threatening <lb/>
voice of the Bishop, the cry of protest, the doubt as <lb/>
to what the word "abjure" really meant. Above <lb/>
all, the love of life so strong in the sweet sunshine&mdash; <lb/>
and then as they flourished a document before her, <lb/>
so easy to make a cross against the name she could <lb/>
not write&mdash;and so the thing was done. It mattered <lb/>
not that the alternative granted by the Church <lb/>
was perpetual imprisonment on bread and water. <lb/>
"People of the Church, lead me to your prison; let <lb/>
me be no longer in the hands of the English!" she <lb/>
cries piteously. But the stern Earl of Warwick <lb/>
was not one to let her go, and the command <lb/>
went forth to lead her back to her cell. Broken <lb/>
in spirit, the Maid returned, and in her new <reg orig="meek-|ness">meekness</reg> <lb/>
put on her the woman's clothes which the <lb/>
Church required of her.</p>
<p>Her enemies had but a brief triumph.</p>
<p>They had left her on the Thursday in woman's <lb/>
garb; but on Monday, when the Bishop visited her <lb/>
again, they found her in her boy's dress once more, <lb/>
pale and depressed, but no longer agitated or in <lb/>
doubt.</p>
<pb n="34" entity="b000514724_0055"/>
<p>They questioned her closely as to why she had <lb/>
done this, and she answered sadly but firmly that <lb/>
it was more lawful to wear a man's dress among <lb/>
men than that of a woman. She said, moreover, <lb/>
that she would rather die than be left in irons; but <lb/>
if they would allow her to go to mass, and take her <lb/>
out of her irons and put her in a gracious prison <lb/>
and a woman with her, she would be good and do <lb/>
whatever the Church pleased.</p>
<p>Most pathetic little speech! How easily one <lb/>
reads between the lines the sick weariness of the <lb/>
heavy chain, the longing for peace and spiritual <lb/>
refreshment, above all the overwhelming desire for <lb/>
a woman's kindly voice and touch in place of <lb/>
the coarse, rough soldiers who surrounded her <lb/>
by night and day. Yet there must have been <lb/>
visible some new gleam of resignation and courage, <lb/>
for they asked her suddenly if she had heard <lb/>
her Voices since Thursday. And she answered, <lb/>
"Yes."</p>
<p>Then the Maid made her brave recantation for <lb/>
that moment's weakness four days ago. "All <lb/>
that she did was done in fear of the fire; she had <lb/>
denied nothing but what was contrary to truth. <lb/>
She would rather make her penitence for this all at <lb/>
one time&mdash;that is to say, in dying&mdash;than to make a <lb/>
long penitence in prison. Her Voices had told her <lb/>
that she had sinned by her denial."</p>
<p>So the broken sentences came forth from the <lb/>
faltering lips; and the astonished judges listened <lb/>
for once, and went forth from the prison in silence. <lb/>
But outside in the courtyard was Warwick, waiting to <lb/>
<pb n="35" entity="b000514724_0056"/>
hear what had passed; and him the Bishop of <lb/>
Beauvais, putting hastily from his mind the memory <lb/>
of the sad young figure within the prison, greeted <lb/>
with joy, saying, "Make good cheer; the thing is <lb/>
done."</p>
<p>Yet even after this terrible interview the Maid <lb/>
seemed to grasp at a hope of deliverance. <lb/>
What girl of scarce nineteen, uncondemned as <lb/>
yet, and strong in her innocence, would fail to <lb/>
do so?</p>
<p>Early in the morning of May 31, 1431, a friar <lb/>
entered her cell with the news of her approaching <lb/>
death. As we have seen, Jeanne was no <reg orig="super-|natural">supernatural</reg> <lb/>
saint, no conventional martyr. Girl-like, <lb/>
she "began to weep and cry, saying, 'Must my <lb/>
body be burned to ashes to-day?'" Then passion <lb/>
seized her. "I would rather be beheaded seven <lb/>
times than burnt!" she sobs angrily. "I appeal <lb/>
to God against all these great wrongs they do <lb/>
me."</p>
<p>But the gust of fury soon passed, and kneeling <lb/>
before the friar she meekly made her last confession, <lb/>
and implored that she might "receive her Saviour." <lb/>
There was some difficulty in getting the Bishop to <lb/>
permit it; but at length a second request touched <lb/>
some more compassionate chord, and the procession <lb/>
of priests set out from the cathedral, with lighted <lb/>
candles and ringing bells, for the prison. The <lb/>
bystanders knelt as they passed by, and prayed <lb/>
aloud for the soul of the Maid whose martyrdom <lb/>
they were about to witness; but even in this last <lb/>
act of piety the Bishop would not let her alone <lb/>
<pb n="36" entity="b000514724_0057"/>
Hurrying to her cell when she had but just <reg orig="re-|ceived">received</reg> <lb/>
the Sacrament, he said, "So, Jeanne, you <lb/>
have always told us that your Voices said that <lb/>
you were to be delivered, and you see now <lb/>
that they have deceived you. Tell us the truth <lb/>
at last."</p>
<p>"Yes, they have deceived me," she answered in <lb/>
a low voice, worn out with the morning's excitement <lb/>
and with dread of what was to come. "Ah, sieur!" <lb/>
she said to one of her judges, "where shall I be <lb/>
to-night?" And he, who had just condemned her <lb/>
for heresy, but who yet was not quite inhuman <lb/>
in the face of that heart - broken face and <lb/>
gesture, asked, "Have you not good faith in the <lb/>
Lord?"</p>
<p>"Ah yes," she cried; "yes, God helping me, I <lb/>
shall be in Paradise."</p>
<p>But resignation and peace were not yet. Dressed <lb/>
in the long white robe of a penitent, she is driven <lb/>
in her <hi rend="italic">charette</hi> through the crowded streets, and <lb/>
death seems incredible in the fresh, sweet air <lb/>
"Rouen! Rouen! Am I to die here?" she murmurs; <lb/>
and then again with tears, "Rouen! Rouen! I fear <lb/>
that you shall yet suffer because of this!" And so <lb/>
they reached the towering scaffold and the stake. <lb/>
Yet up to the very last they would not let her <lb/>
tortured soul alone.</p>
<p>Preached at, lectured, harassed, she paid no longer <lb/>
any heed. "She knelt down on the platform and <lb/>
called on her knees upon the blessed Trinity, the <lb/>
blessed Virgin Mary, and all the blessed saints of <lb/>
Paradise."</p>
<pb n="37" entity="b000514724_0058"/>
<p>"St. Michael! St. Michael! St. Michael, help!"</p>
<p>Thrice the cry for deliverance went forth, but <lb/>
there was no reply.</p>
<p>Even the stony-hearted judges wept to see that <lb/>
pitiful sight.</p>
<p>At length the executioner stepped forward; and <lb/>
now Jeanne, about to ascend to the high stake, <lb/>
asked for a crucifix. None was to be found; but a <lb/>
rough English soldier, whose heart perhaps was full <lb/>
of tears, broke a stick into two unequal parts, bound <lb/>
them hastily together, and handed the cross to <lb/>
the girl. She pressed it to her breast, while the <lb/>
worthy friar who had been with her to the last, <lb/>
hastened to fetch a processional cross with a long <lb/>
staff from a neighbouring church, and this he <lb/>
held high up, that those dying eyes might rest <lb/>
upon it.</p>
<p>Then the flames rose up and curled around the <lb/>
white and trembling figure of the Maid. No sound <lb/>
was heard in the dreadful silence save the crackling <lb/>
of the faggots about the stake, till suddenly from <lb/>
the midst of the thick black smoke a cry broke <lb/>
forth&mdash;</p>
<p>"My Voices <hi rend="italic">were</hi> of God! They have not <lb/>
deceived me!"</p>
<p>"Jesus! Jesus!"</p>
<p>Joy, the joy of recognition of her Lord, of <lb/>
entrance into the Paradise of God, was surely the <lb/>
note of the last words breathed by the parched lips <lb/>
of the Maid of France.</p>
<p>They threw those piteous ashes, with the brave <lb/>
heart intact, into the waters of the Seine; but the <lb/>
<pb n="38" entity="b000514724_0059"/>
English soldiers went to their camp muttering in <lb/>
fear&mdash;</p>
<p>"We are lost! We have burned a Saint."</p>
<p>The verdict of history has fully supported their <lb/>
words.</p>

</epigraph>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">In</hi> the early part of the sixteenth century, one <lb/>
of the most turbulent periods of French history, <lb/>
there was born at the palace of Fontainebleau a <lb/>
little Princess, daughter to the King of Navarre <lb/>
and niece of Francis I. of France. Her mother <lb/>
was the famous Marguerite of Navarre, a poetess <lb/>
and writer of stories, one of the few learned women <lb/>
of that age. Perhaps her time was too much <lb/>
filled with literary work for her to give much <lb/>
attention to her baby, for little Jeanne was sent <lb/>
almost directly after her birth to the estate of <lb/>
Madame de Silly, her governess.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the latter was a good, sensible, kindly <lb/>
woman, who allowed her charge to run about in <lb/>
the gardens and woods like any peasant child, so <lb/>
that she became a strong, healthy little girl, full <lb/>
of high spirits and fearless of danger. But to be <lb/>
born a Princess in those days was indeed no happy <lb/>
lot. It meant in most cases that a girl became <lb/>
<pb n="40" entity="b000514724_0063"/>
a mere tool for use in all kinds of political intrigues, <lb/>
and especially a means of securing fresh territory <lb/>
by virtue of a marriage alliance.</p>
<p>Hence, when Jeanne was three years of age, and <lb/>
her father and mother were leaving France for <lb/>
their own kingdom of Navarre, her uncle, King <lb/>
Francis, would not hear of her accompanying <lb/>
them, but, under the pretence of the superiority <lb/>
of a French education over a Spanish, ordered <lb/>
her to proceed at once to the castle of <reg orig="Plessis-|les-Tours">Plessis-les-Tours</reg>, <lb/>
and to remain there as long as he <lb/>
wished.</p>
<p>Jeanne was, of course, too young to know the <lb/>
reasons for this decree, or to care very much where <lb/>
she lived. But she must have missed the frequent <lb/>
visits to her royal father and uncle, who were both <lb/>
so proud and fond of her that she earned at this <lb/>
time the nickname of <hi rend="italic">"La mignon des rois"</hi> &lpar;the <lb/>
kings' darling&rpar;.</p>
<p>Meantime Jeanne's imprisonment, for such it was <lb/>
in fact though not in name, was made as pleasant <lb/>
as possible to the little girl. She was well taught, <lb/>
and was allowed the company of several children <lb/>
of her own age from time to time, carefully selected <lb/>
from the noblest families in France, and all instructed, <lb/>
no doubt, to convince the Princess that her lot was <lb/>
one to be envied.</p>
<p>So, until she was nine years old, little Jeanne <lb/>
regarded her gilded cage with much content, knowing <lb/>
nothing of the world outside, her mind lulled to <lb/>
sleep by the monotonous regularity of each <reg orig="unevent-|ful">uneventful</reg> <lb/>
day. But the active little soul was developing <lb/>
<pb n="41" entity="b000514724_0064"/>
beneath its apparent lethargy, and it only needed <lb/>
a slight stimulus to stir it to revolt.</p>
<p>Soon after her ninth birthday, her aunt and <lb/>
godmother, the Princess Isabel d'Albret, brought <lb/>
her children to visit their solitary little cousin. <lb/>
These high-spirited youngsters had much to say <lb/>
of the joys of the outside world, of wild rides over <lb/>
moorland stretches on the one hand, and of gay <lb/>
carnivals and pageants on the other. They looked <lb/>
with disgust on the gloom of the royal castle of <lb/>
Plessis, surrounded by dense forests and washed <lb/>
by the rushing waters of the Loire. They told <lb/>
her of the past history of the place, when it was <lb/>
the favourite fortress of their terrible ancestor, <lb/>
Louis XI., pointing out the iron cages in which <lb/>
that dread tyrant immured his victims, and the <lb/>
pitfalls by which the palace was surrounded. By <lb/>
the time the visit was over, Jeanne was a different <lb/>
child. She knew herself a prisoner, and began to <lb/>
long for a freedom of which as yet she knew so <lb/>
little. She would not study; she wrote imploring <lb/>
letters to her father and to her uncle, begging <lb/>
that she might live with her parents or reside at <lb/>
the French Court; and when this was refused, <lb/>
she would not answer their letters, but gave herself <lb/>
up to melancholy and dejection.</p>
<p>The Castle became for her a place of terror. <lb/>
She thought she heard the rasping voice of Louis XI. <lb/>
echo through the great hall, and saw the victims <lb/>
of Tristan l'Hermite, his provost-marshal, hanging <lb/>
from every tree in the gardens. She hated to leave <lb/>
her room, where she sat crying miserably for hours <lb/>
<pb n="42" entity="b000514724_0065"/>
together, till her pretty complexion grew dull and <lb/>
her bright hair wild and neglected.</p>
<p>But Francis was inexorable. He dreaded that <lb/>
her father would marry the Princess to Philip of <lb/>
Spain, and thus join together the provinces of Spain <lb/>
proper and Navarre. His only concession, three <lb/>
years later, was to arrange another marriage for <lb/>
her himself, with the Duke of Cleves, a gallant <lb/>
youth, who as a Lutheran would strengthen the <lb/>
bond of union between the Protestants of the North <lb/>
and France.</p>
<p>Jeanne, however, was not willing to pay such <lb/>
a price for freedom. The very idea of marriage <lb/>
may have been distasteful to her, as to many young <lb/>
girls; possibly she disliked the union with a husband <lb/>
who held a different faith from that in which she <lb/>
had been strictly brought up. Certainly her pride <lb/>
of birth and country had much to do with her <lb/>
vehement dislike, for when she was sent for to <lb/>
the Court to be introduced to her suitor, this <reg orig="twelve-|year-old">twelve-year-old</reg> <lb/>
child behaved in so stiff and reserved a <lb/>
manner that the King became very angry with <lb/>
her; but when, at his request, her governess, <lb/>
Madame de Silly, scolded her well for her want <lb/>
of courtesy to him, and reminded her of the <lb/>
advantages of the match, Jeanne replied with scorn, <lb/>
"I see no advantage in leaving my land of France <lb/>
and my inheritance of Navarre to marry a Duke <lb/>
of Cleves."</p>
<p>Of course the King's will prevailed, and the <lb/>
arrangements for the betrothal began. But Jeanne <lb/>
did not cease to rebel, and when she found that <lb/>
<pb n="43" entity="b000514724_0066"/>
of no avail, relieved her feelings by a secret protest, <lb/>
in the form of a letter, signed by herself and <lb/>
witnessed by three of her household, to the effect <lb/>
that she was being forced into the marriage by dread <lb/>
of "the King my father and the Queen my mother, <lb/>
who have threatened to have me whipped by my <lb/>
governess. If I do not consent &lpar;she tells me&rpar;, I <lb/>
shall be punished so severely as to cause my death; <lb/>
and that by refusing I may bring about the ruin <lb/>
and destruction of my parents and their house."</p>
<p>A sense of the inevitable, rather than actual <lb/>
fear, seems to have been the real means which <lb/>
brought the high-spirited child to the hated union. <lb/>
She was not even afraid to affront publicly her <lb/>
all-powerful uncle, the King of France; for when <lb/>
at the marriage ceremony he advanced to lead <lb/>
the child to the altar, the little bride, rising sulkily <lb/>
from her seat, declared that her heavy robes, studded <lb/>
with jewels, prevented her from walking.</p>
<p>Alas for her dignity! At a sign from the King, <lb/>
the Constable de Montmorency took her up in his <lb/>
arms and carried her to the chapel, where the <lb/>
ceremony was concluded. Curiously enough, she <lb/>
never saw her husband again; for directly the jousts <lb/>
and tourneys and banquets that celebrated the <lb/>
wedding feast were over, she went away with her <lb/>
mother to Pau, there to complete her education, <lb/>
until she was old enough to rejoin the Duke.</p>
<p>During the two peaceful years she spent in her <lb/>
mother's care the political outlook changed. The <lb/>
Duke of Cleves joined the side of Spain, and Francis, <lb/>
in great wrath, obtained from the Pope a formal <lb/>
<pb n="44" entity="b000514724_0067"/>
annulling of the marriage with his niece, to the <lb/>
latter's great joy and relief. It was with very <lb/>
different feelings that she looked upon her second <lb/>
suitor, Antoine, Duke of Vend&ocirc;me, although he was <lb/>
but a poor creature, changeable and uncertain in <lb/>
mood and temper. His handsome face and charm <lb/>
of manner appealed strongly, however, to Jeanne, <lb/>
now a beautiful and accomplished girl of nineteen. <lb/>
She disregarded the opposition of her cousin, <lb/>
Henri II., who had succeeded to the French crown, <lb/>
married the fascinating Antoine, and was <reg orig="pro-|claimed">proclaimed</reg> <lb/>
with him the direct heir of the kingdom of <lb/>
Navarre.</p>
<p>During these quiet years at Pau, Jeanne had <lb/>
heard and read much of the principles of the religion <lb/>
of the Lutherans or Huguenots, as they were called <lb/>
in France, and began to incline towards them. But <lb/>
before she could make public profession of a change <lb/>
of creed, family troubles began to throng upon her.</p>
<p>Two months after the marriage her mother <lb/>
suddenly died, which not only plunged Jeanne <lb/>
into the deepest grief, but left her with most of the <lb/>
business of public affairs upon her hands, since her <lb/>
father was too crushed, and her husband too <reg orig="in-|different">indifferent</reg>, <lb/>
to manage them aright.</p>
<p>Thus her first child was left to the care of <lb/>
Madame de Silly, who, either because she had become <lb/>
demented in her old age or because she thought a <lb/>
prince required more careful rearing than a princess, <lb/>
coddled and cosseted the boy, keeping him <reg orig="per-|petually">perpetually</reg> <lb/>
in a hot nursery for fear he should take <lb/>
cold; and thus he became so weak, that although <lb/>
<pb n="45" entity="b000514724_0068"/>
his mother did all she could to remedy the harm <lb/>
done, he died before he was two years old.</p>
<p>This was a great blow to the old King of Navarre, <lb/>
who longed for an heir in the direct line of male <lb/>
descent. Before long, however, he was presented <lb/>
with another grandson, a strong and sturdy boy, <lb/>
who became the apple of his eye.</p>
<p>The fate of this little Prince was no less sad than <lb/>
that of his brother. While his parents were one <lb/>
day with his grandfather at the chase, the nurse <lb/>
stood by the open window with the sleeping child <lb/>
in her arms. Outside stood one of the King's <lb/>
gentlemen, who asked her to let him hold the Prince. <lb/>
She agreed, and the boy was thrown in fun from <lb/>
one to the other several times. Then the lady <lb/>
missed her hold, and the poor baby falling on to a <lb/>
marble step, broke a rib. In terror they strove to <lb/>
hide what had happened; but the child sickened <lb/>
and died in agony, and then the whole story came <lb/>
out.</p>
<p>The poor old King, mad with grief, seemed to <lb/>
think it was all Jeanne's fault. He declared that she <lb/>
should never be Queen of Navarre, and was only <lb/>
appeased when she promised that if she had another <lb/>
son he should be given over entirely to him. A <lb/>
year later she gave birth to the child who was to be <lb/>
the famous Henry of Navarre and <hi rend="italic">"Henri Quatre"</hi> <lb/>
of France. Strong and vigorous from his birth, the <lb/>
boy was almost worshipped by his grandfather, until <lb/>
the latter's death, two years later, made Jeanne <lb/>
Queen of Navarre.</p>
<p>Well indeed was it for her that she possessed a <lb/>
<pb n="46" entity="b000514724_0069"/>
strong will and an inflexible purpose, for a hard <lb/>
time lay before her. The death of her father left <lb/>
her free to carry out a long cherished intention to <lb/>
openly declare her faith in the creed of the <lb/>
Huguenots.</p>
<p>This cost her the love and loyalty of her <reg orig="weak-|willed">weak-willed</reg> <lb/>
husband, who was persuaded by Catherine de <lb/>
Medici, Queen of France, and the determined <reg orig="up-|holder">upholder</reg> <lb/>
of the Catholic cause, to try to get a <lb/>
separation from Jeanne, on the understanding that his <lb/>
next wife should be Mary Queen of Scots. At <lb/>
first the young Queen was overwhelmed with grief <lb/>
and horror, and roused herself to plead fiercely for <lb/>
herself and her son; but when she was forced to <lb/>
realise the selfishness and worthless character of <lb/>
Antoine de Bourbon, she said farewell to him with <lb/>
a breaking heart and returned to Navarre, determined <lb/>
to bring up her child to be a better man than his <lb/>
father.</p>
<p>Her life-work henceforth was devoted to the <lb/>
Huguenot cause. The outbreak of bitter <reg orig="persecu-|tion">persecution</reg> <lb/>
in France brought thousands of refugees to the <lb/>
Court of Navarre, where they were always sure of <lb/>
help and protection; and as the days of cruelty and <lb/>
misunderstanding grew darker in the land, so did the <lb/>
young Queen brace herself the more to fulfil her task.</p>
<p>In 1562 the weak and fickle Antoine de Bourbon <lb/>
died, professing himself on his deathbed to be of <lb/>
his wife's religion. From henceforth Jeanne stood <lb/>
alone against the great Catholic forces which were <lb/>
fighting, not so much for their faith as for their <lb/>
politics. She was only thirty - four when her <lb/>
<pb n="47" entity="b000514724_0070"/>
husband died, but she never thought of marrying <lb/>
again, or made any effort after that life of domestic <lb/>
happiness which as yet had never been hers. Her <lb/>
one watchword was, "For the Cause!"</p>
<p>But in the year 1569, after the terrible defeat of <lb/>
the battle of Carnac, the Huguenot cause seemed <lb/>
lost. The great Prince of Cond&eacute; had fallen, and <lb/>
there was no one to lead his disheartened followers. <lb/>
Coligny, the Admiral of France, came forward in <lb/>
Cond&eacute;'s place, but when he arrayed his troops in <lb/>
order for battle, he saw by the despondency of <lb/>
the soldiers that they had lost all confidence in <lb/>
themselves, and were on the verge of a general <lb/>
panic.</p>
<p>But one day, as the men were gloomily bestirring <lb/>
themselves to obey the call to arms, the trumpet <lb/>
sounded a new arrival in the camp. Down the field <lb/>
in the midst of the lines rode the Queen of Navarre, <lb/>
with a gallant boy on either hand. The Huguenot <lb/>
leaders gathered round her, the men roused <reg orig="them-|selves">themselves</reg> <lb/>
from their apathy to give a shout of welcome <lb/>
as she halted to address them, with one hand upon <lb/>
the shoulder of Henry of Navarre, a bright-faced <lb/>
boy of fifteen, while with the other she pointed to <lb/>
young Henry of Cond&eacute;, son of the late Duke.</p>
<p>"Children of God and France!" she cried, "Cond&eacute; <lb/>
is no more. That Prince who so often set you <lb/>
an example of courage and stainless honour has <lb/>
sacrificed his life in the most noble of causes! <lb/>
Instead of receiving from my hands the laurel wreath <lb/>
which would have been the just reward of his valour, <lb/>
his brow now shines with a crown of everlasting <lb/>
<pb n="48" entity="b000514724_0071"/>
glory. Soldiers, you weep! But tell me, does the <lb/>
memory of Cond&eacute; demand nothing more than <lb/>
tears? Will you be satisfied with empty regrets? <lb/>
No! let us unite&mdash;let us recall our courage&mdash;to <lb/>
defend a cause that can never die, and to avenge <lb/>
him who was its most illustrious supporter. To the <lb/>
brave soldiers who have fought for this cause now I <lb/>
add my son. Prove ye his courage! The blood of <lb/>
Bourbon and of Valois flows in his veins. He <lb/>
burns with holy ardour to avenge the death of <lb/>
Cond&eacute;. Behold also Cond&eacute;'s son, whom henceforth <lb/>
I adopt as my own child. He inherits his name <lb/>
and fame. Soldiers! I offer you everything that <lb/>
is within my power to bestow&mdash;my kingdom, my <lb/>
treasures, my life, and what is dearer to me than <lb/>
all, my children!"</p>
<p>The whole assembly was hushed for an instant as <lb/>
she ceased speaking.</p>
<p>Then, with a roar and a tumult of cheers, the <lb/>
soldiers pressed around the Queen and demanded <lb/>
to be led at once into the fight. Headlong into <lb/>
the midst of the excited troops rushed the young <lb/>
Prince of Navarre, and with one great universal <lb/>
shout he was hailed as their leader. "Soldiers!" <lb/>
he cried in his clear boyish voice, in answer to their <lb/>
demand, "your cause is mine. Our interests are <lb/>
the same. I swear by my honour and my life I <lb/>
will never abandon you."</p>
<p>Thus by her courage and tact at a most eventful <lb/>
crisis of the great religious struggle did Jeanne <lb/>
d'Albret save the Huguenot cause. For the next <lb/>
few years success met their arms in almost every <lb/>
<pb n="49" entity="b000514724_0072"/>
encounter, though at the cost of the lives of many <lb/>
of their greatest generals. One of these, however, <lb/>
was saved by the wisdom and womanly tenderness <lb/>
of the Queen. The right arm of General La Noue <lb/>
was fractured by a musket ball, and it became <lb/>
necessary to amputate the limb as an alternative <lb/>
to death. Aghast at the idea of never again striking <lb/>
a blow for France, La Noue refused to permit the <lb/>
operation, saying he would rather die than live a <lb/>
useless log.</p>
<p>In vain his friends entreated him: at length they <lb/>
asked the Queen to do what she could to persuade <lb/>
him. Hastening to the bedside of the wounded man, <lb/>
Jeanne soothed and encouraged him with hopes of <lb/>
future usefulness, while gently rebuking him for his <lb/>
impatience. Still he would not submit, unless she <lb/>
would be present to encourage him during the <lb/>
ordeal. To this she agreed, removed the bandages <lb/>
with her own hands, and cheated him during the <lb/>
whole of the painful operation. Nor did her <reg orig="kind-|ness">kindness</reg> <lb/>
end there. She had an iron arm made for <lb/>
him, so skilfully contrived that he could guide his <lb/>
horse, and under the name of La Noue "Bras de <lb/>
Fer," he won great renown.</p>
<p>One can but be thankful that the brave and <lb/>
tender-hearted Queen did not live to see the day <lb/>
of the awful Massacre of St. Bartholomew, which <lb/>
seemed for a time to have dealt a deathblow to <lb/>
the Huguenot cause. Only two months previously <lb/>
she was staying in Paris, where a kind of armistice <lb/>
had been patched up between the leaders of the <lb/>
two parties by an arrangement for the marriage of <lb/>
<pb n="50" entity="b000514724_0073"/>
Henry of Navarre with his cousin Margaret, sister <lb/>
of the French king. She was delighted with the <lb/>
gorgeous reception given to young Henry, and took <lb/>
the keenest interest in the preparations for the <lb/>
wedding.</p>
<p>Just as would be the case nowadays, shopping <lb/>
occupied a good deal of her time, and amongst <lb/>
other places visited by her was the <hi rend="italic">magasin</hi> of <lb/>
Ren&eacute;, court perfumer and, it was darkly whispered, <lb/>
secret poisoner to Catherine de Medici, the Queen, <lb/>
who hated Jeanne with a mortal hatred. Here the <lb/>
Queen of Navarre bought a store of drugs, perfumes, <lb/>
and embroidered gloves. A few days later, on <reg orig="re-|turning">returning</reg> <lb/>
from one of these expeditions, she complained <lb/>
of pain and extreme weariness.</p>
<p>Fever set in, but the King's physicians, hastily <lb/>
sent for failed to discover either cause or remedy. <lb/>
Whispers of poison, administered through gloves, <lb/>
began to be heard, and her attendants were in a <lb/>
state of much agitation and terror. Jeanne herself, <lb/>
however, was perfectly calm, even when suffering <lb/>
intense pain. She seems to have felt very keenly <lb/>
how little happiness had been vouchsafed to her <lb/>
in this life, and to look forward with resignation <lb/>
and even joy to a more peaceful future. Gradually <lb/>
she sank, and with the words "In Thee, O Lord, <lb/>
have I put my trust," ringing in her ears, she passed <lb/>
away.</p>
<p>It was perhaps well that she was spared not only <lb/>
the horror of the Massacre of St. Bartholomew, but <lb/>
also the knowledge that a few years later her <reg orig="re-|markable">remarkable</reg> <lb/>
son, Henry of Navarre, the hero of Ivry <lb/>
<pb n="51" entity="b000514724_0074"/>
and of many another fight, gave up the Huguenot <lb/>
faith and became a Catholic in order to gain Paris. <lb/>
We cannot imagine that even the liberty and peace <lb/>
which was at once accorded to the Huguenots by <lb/>
him would have compensated her for what her <lb/>
steadfast, upright nature would have called a breach <lb/>
of honour.</p>
<p>But when these things came to pass, Jeanne <lb/>
d'Albret was sleeping by the side of her faithless <lb/>
husband in the cathedral of Vend&ocirc;me.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Very</hi> few characters of history have aroused <lb/>
such a storm of controversy as that which <lb/>
has raged round the figure of Mary of Scotland. <lb/>
All kinds of evidence have been produced to show <lb/>
that she was a martyr, suffering in her innocence <lb/>
for the prejudices and passions of her relatives; or, <lb/>
on the other hand, to prove her a beautiful deceiver, <lb/>
full of wickedness within, the destroyer of the bodies <lb/>
and souls of men.</p>
<p>The more we study the story and the documents <lb/>
of her time, the more we are struck with the <reg orig="ex-|aggeration">exaggeration</reg> <lb/>
of both views. For Mary was above all <lb/>
things a very human person, full of passionate <lb/>
longings and desires for good as well as sometimes <lb/>
for evil ends.</p>
<p>Her beauty, her high spirits, her generous love <lb/>
for women and children, may have been <reg orig="counter-|balanced">counterbalanced</reg> <lb/>
by her sudden revulsions of affection, and <lb/>
the extremes to which she would go in order to rid <lb/>
herself of those she hated; but it must not be <lb/>
forgotten that if there is such a thing as expiation <lb/>
<pb n="54" entity="b000514724_0079"/>
for sin in this life, Mary, by her long captivity of <lb/>
twenty-one years, and her violent death in an <lb/>
English prison, did much to atone for the sins of <lb/>
those brief, passionate six years in Scotland.</p>
<p>The life of Mary Stuart is, of course, mixed up <lb/>
almost inextricably with the tangled politics of her <lb/>
period; and since it would be clearly impossible to <lb/>
deal with these adequately within narrow limits, we <lb/>
will only try to get some idea of her life and <lb/>
character by taking a series of glimpses at various <lb/>
critical points of her career.</p>
<p>Mary Stuart was born on the 8th of December <lb/>
1542, just after her father, James v., had crept away, <lb/>
beaten and heartbroken, from the field of Solway <lb/>
Moss. "It came with a lass, it will go with a lass," <lb/>
he muttered gloomily, as he thought of the unsettled <lb/>
kingdom, already torn with internal strife. A little <lb/>
later, he turned his face to the wall and died.</p>
<p>His wife, Mary of Guise, was too brave a woman <lb/>
to give way under the troubles that thronged upon <lb/>
her with his death. Here she was, a French <lb/>
woman, in the midst of a nation intensely hostile <lb/>
to "foreigners," face to face with the powerful <lb/>
Scottish lords, who hated her for being a "Papist," <lb/>
and her new-born child for standing between some of <lb/>
them and the throne; dreading, moreover, the next <lb/>
move of Henry VIII. of England, whose one aim <lb/>
was to get a grip of Scotland by fair means or <lb/>
foul, and who was already plotting to betroth the <lb/>
baby - princess to his own sickly son, Prince <lb/>
Edward.</p>
<p>So our first glimpse of Mary Stuart, the "most <lb/>
<pb n="55" entity="b000514724_0080"/>
perfect child in the world," is on board the French <lb/>
fleet, at the age of five and a half, playing happily <lb/>
with four other child Maries, on her way to France <lb/>
to be affianced to the weakly little boy of four and <lb/>
a half who was the Dauphin of that land. The <lb/>
thirteen years which Mary spent at the French <lb/>
Court afforded a curious training for the girl.</p>
<p>The Court was ruled by Catherine de Medici, one <lb/>
of the most unscrupulous and dangerous of women; <lb/>
and the child's fine intuitions and quick wit soon <lb/>
taught her to curb her naturally frank speech and <lb/>
ready impulses, and to wear a cloak of caution and <lb/>
wariness before the scarcely veiled hostility of her <lb/>
mother-in-law. It was during these impressionable <lb/>
years that she must have learnt that love of intrigue <lb/>
and double-dealing of which her enemies so <reg orig="passion-|ately">passionately</reg> <lb/>
accuse her, and which her friends cannot deny. <lb/>
But it was no second nature with Mary as with <lb/>
Catherine, and assorts ill indeed with the high spirits, <lb/>
quick temper, and frank outbursts of joy or wrath <lb/>
of which we see traces to the end.</p>
<p>Let us take our second glimpse at Mary the <lb/>
Queen in the year 1561. It is a cold misty morning <lb/>
in a "Scotch" August, and Mary alighting from the <lb/>
galley which has brought her across the sea, sets <lb/>
foot once more on her native shores.</p>
<p>Seven months previously, her young husband, an <lb/>
eighteen-months' king, had died; she had worn the <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">deuil blanc</hi>, the white mourning of France, with the <lb/>
knowledge that life had to be faced all over again; <lb/>
and now the news that since her mother's death <lb/>
Scotland had fast drifted into a sort of <reg orig="Common-|wealth">Commonwealth</reg>, <lb/>
<pb n="56" entity="b000514724_0081"/>
ruled by her half-brother, Lord James <lb/>
Murray, roused Mary to take her leave of her "fair <lb/>
land of France," and go to claim her own.</p>
<p>But Scotland was taken unawares, and Mary, <lb/>
weary with the strain of leave-taking and journeying, <lb/>
weeps over the sorry nags which are collected in <lb/>
haste to take the Queen to Holyrood. Ill-omened <lb/>
tears indeed, that bedewed the land which within <lb/>
the next seven years was to drive her from its <lb/>
borders.</p>
<p>Mary's high spirits soon returned, however. She <lb/>
was but nineteen, queen of one fair realm, and next <lb/>
heir to its sister kingdom across the Cheviots. It <lb/>
mattered little to her that Elizabeth, her cousin, had <lb/>
offered her a direct insult in refusing to grant her a <lb/>
passage by way of England, or that John Knox <lb/>
was stirring the minds of the "godly men" of <lb/>
Edinburgh against a queen who went to mass as <lb/>
naturally as to her morning meal. Already those <lb/>
same men were feeling the influence of her ready <lb/>
smile and gracious words. "I think there be some <lb/>
enchantment whereby men are bewitched," said one <lb/>
long-faced lord to another who had been won against <lb/>
his will by the charm and grace of his young mistress.</p>
<p>She made a valiant attempt to introduce into <lb/>
the Scottish Court a faint reflection of the gay <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">insouciance</hi> of that at St. Germain. Her four Maries <lb/>
joined Scottish warmth and loyalty to French <lb/>
vivacity; each had her gallant lover, and the young <lb/>
Queen joyously encouraged their love-making. She <lb/>
had no need to conciliate her women. Their <lb/>
affection for her outlived all the sorrows and shame <lb/>
<pb n="57" entity="b000514724_0082"/>
and disasters of the years to come, and followed her <lb/>
almost to the gates of death itself.</p>
<p>It was her delight to dress these high-born <lb/>
Scottish maidens in her own fine clothes, and the <lb/>
marriage of any one of them was always the occasion <lb/>
for Mary herself to clothe the bride in a sumptuous <lb/>
gown of her own giving.</p>
<p>Hence, with high hopes of a new and prosperous <lb/>
career, Mary laid down the crown of France and <lb/>
took up once more the crown of Scotland. But <lb/>
within a few months the figure of the man who was <lb/>
the evil genuis of the young Queen crosses her <lb/>
path and then again disappears. James Hepburn, <lb/>
Earl of Bothwell, had been described by Mary of <lb/>
Guise to her daughter as a "glorious and hazardous <lb/>
young man." Fascinating to women, he was very <lb/>
generally hated by his brother peers, who brought <lb/>
against him a wild accusation of plotting to kill <lb/>
Murray, kidnap the Queen, and then get all Scotland <lb/>
into his hands. Very unwillingly Mary signed the <lb/>
order for his imprisonment in Edinburgh Castle. <lb/>
She had already looked into those daring, handsome <lb/>
eyes, and felt a mysterious attraction. With relief <lb/>
she heard that he had broken ward and escaped to <lb/>
France.</p>
<p>Then the dull monotony of Scottish life resumed <lb/>
its persistent sway over the Court again. If a ball <lb/>
was held at Holyrood, it became the subject of <lb/>
angry denunciation in Knox's Sunday sermon; and <lb/>
every new-comer, especially if he carried violin or <lb/>
manuscript in his hand, was scanned with the <lb/>
utmost disfavour.</p>
<pb n="58" entity="b000514724_0083"/>
<p>And amongst these latter was an Italian called <lb/>
Riccio, "a merry fellow and a good musician," who <lb/>
helped to while away many a dull hour, and who, as <lb/>
French secretary, soon became one of Mary's most <lb/>
valued servants.</p>
<p>Our next glimpse shows the Queen at Stirling <lb/>
Castle, whither a gay young lover has now followed <lb/>
her. It is hard for us to see wherein the attraction <lb/>
lay in the weak-willed Darnley, a peevish boy of <lb/>
nineteen, for the gallant, high-hearted Mary in her <lb/>
twenty-fourth year. His birth was all that was <lb/>
fitting; for he was her cousin, and near to the thrones <lb/>
both of England and Scotland; he was tall, too, <lb/>
and not ill-looking, "the lustiest and best-<reg orig="pro-|portioned">proportioned</reg> <lb/>
long man she had seen." Then his youth <lb/>
and evident weakness awoke the womanly side of <lb/>
her. Very unromantically, he fell ill of measles <lb/>
whilst courting her at Stirling, and there he had <lb/>
willing "tendance from the greatest and the fairest" <lb/>
of the land.</p>
<p>But while the Scottish lords under Murray, backed <lb/>
as usual by Elizabeth of England, were doing all in <lb/>
their power to stop the marriage, the rumour of a <lb/>
plot made by them to seize Mary and Darnley on <lb/>
their way from Perth to Edinburgh came to the <lb/>
Queen's ears. Her courage at once rose to meet <lb/>
the danger. Horses were secretly ordered at <lb/>
daybreak, and the whole train, sweeping past the <lb/>
Castle of Loch Leven, where Murray, unsuspecting, <lb/>
lay asleep, reached Edinburgh in safety.</p>
<p>This precipitated affairs. A secret marriage was <lb/>
celebrated, and repeated in public at Holyrood; and <lb/>
<pb n="59" entity="b000514724_0084"/>
on the surface Mary seemed to have gained all she <lb/>
wished. She delighted to bow her proud head <lb/>
before this undisciplined boy and to offer him <lb/>
"honour, submission, and obedience, as to my <lb/>
husband and my king." But Darnely, vain and <lb/>
obstinate, took it all as a matter of course, and gave <lb/>
nothing in return for the love of a woman who had <lb/>
risked for him her very kingdom. For the marriage <lb/>
was the signal for the open rebellion of Murray and <lb/>
his adherents, and Mary found few whom she could <lb/>
trust upon her side. She herself had no fears. <lb/>
The grim John Knox himself acknowledged that <lb/>
she was the "best man in the country." As for <lb/>
finding help in Darnley, both friends and foes were <lb/>
agreed when they said that "sic a creature could <lb/>
have no long life among this people."</p>
<p>Meantime another Scottish lord was burning to <lb/>
throw himself into the heart of the strife and to aim <lb/>
a blow at Murray. Bothwell hastily summoned <lb/>
from France, took up arms in the Queen's defence. <lb/>
Mary herself rode against the insurgents, and within <lb/>
a few weeks the rebellion was a thing of the past.</p>
<p>Yet the Queen was irritable, nervous, and out of <lb/>
spirits in the days that followed.</p>
<p>Within a few months of her hasty marriage her <lb/>
feeling for Darnley had entirely changed. He was <lb/>
not worth fighting for.</p>
<p>Quite unfit for rule, with no instinct for affairs, <lb/>
he yet insisted obstinately on a fuller share in <lb/>
state matters, and constantly urged his claim to the <lb/>
"crown matrimonial," which would give him equal <lb/>
rights with his wife during her lifetime and <reg orig="un-|disputed">undisputed</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="60" entity="b000514724_0085"/>
succession to the throne on her death. <lb/>
But Mary would not have it so. His boasting, <lb/>
cowardice, and growing habits of intemperance made <lb/>
his presence hateful to her; and a silly, ill-bred <lb/>
insult offered to a French nobleman, sent by the <lb/>
King of France to confer an Order upon him, was <lb/>
the excuse for his exclusion with open contempt <lb/>
from her council-chamber.</p>
<p>The hostile Lords found him, in his angry <reg orig="re-|sentment">resentment</reg>, <lb/>
a ready tool to use against the wife who <lb/>
was soon to be the mother of his child. What <lb/>
more easy than to convince him that Riccio was at <lb/>
the bottom of all this treatment, that Riccio, whose <lb/>
influence over the Queen was so well known, had <lb/>
conspired to keep him from her councils, where the <lb/>
secretary was of such importance?</p>
<p>Our next picture of Mary Stuart is one of <lb/>
terror and bloodshed. The candles gleam on the <lb/>
silver appointments of the supper-table in the little <lb/>
slip room opening out of Mary's bedchamber at <lb/>
Holyrood, and round it sit the queen, David <lb/>
Riccio, her half-sister the Countess of Argyle, her <lb/>
brother Lord Robert, and her squire Arthur <lb/>
Erskine.</p>
<p>Suddenly in the doorway stands Darnley, with a <lb/>
look half blustering, half terrified on his weak, <lb/>
boyish face. He says nothing, but the hard, fierce <lb/>
eyes and ready weapons of the Lords behind him tell <lb/>
their own tale. The wretched secretary cowers <lb/>
behind his royal mistress, as Ruthven's harsh voice <lb/>
answers her imperious question as to why they have <lb/>
come with the answer&mdash;</p>
<pb n="61" entity="b000514724_0086"/>
<p>"We want yon Davie; he has been here long <lb/>
enough!"</p>
<p>At once she turns with scathing tones upon her <lb/>
wretched young husband&mdash;</p>
<p>"Is this <hi rend="italic">your</hi> work?"</p>
<p>Then the lights go out as he grasps her hands, <lb/>
and the table crashes over, and the shrieking victim <lb/>
is dragged outside the door and stabbed to death. <lb/>
And Mary finds herself alone and practically a <lb/>
prisoner.</p>
<p>What were her thoughts that awful night we <lb/>
know not: that a terrible revenge on Darnley <lb/>
formed part of them we are forced to believe. <lb/>
Meantime she set herself to cajole and flatter him <lb/>
into believing that his protection was necessary to <lb/>
her, that he must help her to escape the next night, <lb/>
for that the Lords would never be content with <lb/>
vengeance upon Riccio alone. So at midnight they <lb/>
fled through a gap in the wall, stumbling through <lb/>
the courtyard over Riccio's new-made grave; and <lb/>
there Mary paused for an instant, muttering darkly <lb/>
that "a fatter than Davie should lie as low ere <lb/>
another year was out," while her wretched companion <lb/>
uttered some broken words of regret.</p>
<p>Then came the long ride with the women and <lb/>
three others to Dunbar and safety&mdash;a terrible <lb/>
experience to Mary in her state of weakness and <lb/>
overstrained nerves&mdash;but the selfish young King <lb/>
thought of no one but himself. He looked round <lb/>
in terror for signs of pursuit, and urged his wife so <lb/>
frequently to ride faster, that at length in scorn <lb/>
"she bade him push on and take care of himself." <lb/>
<pb n="62" entity="b000514724_0087"/>
This he did, "very thoughtlessly" says one of their <lb/>
followers, and was found by his contemptuous and <lb/>
reproachful little band in the empty castle at <lb/>
Dunbar, waiting impatiently for the meal which Mary, <lb/>
weary as she was, at once helped her women to <lb/>
prepare.</p>
<p>The birth of the child James, three months <lb/>
later, when this storm had apparently blown over, <lb/>
did nothing to reconcile husband and wife. She <lb/>
grew to hate the very sight of Darnley, and taunted <lb/>
him openly with his cowardice and inferiority to <lb/>
such men as "my lord of Bothwell." At the <lb/>
gorgeous ceremony of the christening of the <reg orig="baby-|prince">baby-prince</reg>, <lb/>
heir to the kingdoms of England and <lb/>
Scotland, the King sulkily refused to appear upon <lb/>
the scene. Mary herself was heard to utter desperate <lb/>
wishes that aught might happen to rid her of such a <lb/>
husband; and meantime the gallant figure of <lb/>
Bothwell appeared more and more frequently at <lb/>
her side.</p>
<p>In our next picture the gloom has darkened still <lb/>
more.</p>
<p>The scene is the lonely and deserted house near the <lb/>
ruined Kirk of St. Mary in the Fields. The King, <lb/>
who had fallen sick of the smallpox in his father's <lb/>
house in Glasgow, had been brought hither in a litter <lb/>
by his wife, in order that he might undergo a <lb/>
course of treatment and be cured of his illness. <lb/>
She had visited him before, and listened with <lb/>
scarcely concealed loathing to his mingled insults <lb/>
and protestations of affection and repentance. <lb/>
And now it is the appointed night, and Mary <lb/>
<pb n="63" entity="b000514724_0088"/>
goes from a wedding feast to say her farewell to <lb/>
him.</p>
<p>While she sits by the bedside where he lies with <lb/>
his disfigured face covered with a taffetas mask, the <lb/>
servants of Bothwell are piling the powder bags in <lb/>
the vault underneath his room. Once there are <lb/>
sinister sounds from below, and Bothwell, who with <lb/>
two other noblemen had been playing at dice in the <lb/>
sick-chamber, leaves the room hastily to order quiet. <lb/>
The Queen sits on unmoved, talking quite gently to <lb/>
her husband. Once only does her voice harden, as <lb/>
she reminds him suddenly that it is now almost a <lb/>
year since Riccio's murder.</p>
<p>Then Bothwell returns, and she leaves with a <lb/>
hasty kiss and the present of a ring. How one <lb/>
could wish that history had never had to record that <lb/>
faithless embrace, that treacherous gift!</p>
<p>The picture is veiled in smoke and confusion and <lb/>
ruin.</p>
<p>The body of the unfortunate youth, with that of <lb/>
his little "bed-boy," was found next morning at <lb/>
some distance from the house, untouched by smoke <lb/>
or powder. It is supposed that Bothwell and his <lb/>
men had returned after midnight to make sure of <lb/>
their prey by strangling him, as alarmed by the <lb/>
ominous sounds below, he tried to escape from the <lb/>
doomed building.</p>
<p>At once a sinister rumour began to spread abroad. <lb/>
Mary was not one to disguise her feelings, and <lb/>
everyone knew the terms she had been on with the <lb/>
late King. The people of Edinburgh kept up an <lb/>
angry mutter; and midnight voices called upon the <lb/>
<pb n="64" entity="b000514724_0089"/>
name of Bothwell as that of a murderer in the dark <lb/>
streets. Yet Mary, lost to all sense of danger, was <lb/>
during those very weeks heaping honours of every <lb/>
kind upon the suspected Earl. She at least would <lb/>
stand by him, though only a few months later he <lb/>
was not ashamed to desert her in her time of <lb/>
need.</p>
<p>The next picture is full of wild romance. The <lb/>
Queen, accompanied by a few trusty followers, is <lb/>
riding from Stirling to Edinburgh at noonday, when <lb/>
just where the road crosses a bridge, the jingle of <lb/>
bridles and spurs is heard, and loud cries of "Halt!" <lb/>
No resistance is offered: the attendants are dismissed, <lb/>
the leader of the band of pretended highwaymen <lb/>
seizes the Queen's bridle and rides off with her, while <lb/>
she, in spite of her usual courage and impetuosity, <lb/>
shows neither surprise nor resistance. Off gallop <lb/>
the horses, Bothwell on his great black charger <lb/>
keeping but a pace in front of the Queen's gallant <lb/>
grey; and so they fly through the heather and the <lb/>
whistling wind to the fortress of Dunbar, whither <lb/>
Mary had fled in very different company little <lb/>
more than a year ago.</p>
<p>When Mary Stuart returned from Dunbar to face <lb/>
the world again, she found all Scotland had turned <lb/>
against her. That their Queen should be about to <lb/>
marry a swaggering borderer, freely accused of the <lb/>
murder of the King, was enough for her friends, and far <lb/>
more than enough for those who had always watched <lb/>
her with an unfriendly eye. "God bless your Grace if <lb/>
you are saikless &lpar;innocent&rpar; of the King's murder!" cried <lb/>
the fishwives in their broad Scots after her, as she <lb/>
<pb n="65" entity="b000514724_0090"/>
passed them in the street; and the wedding, which <lb/>
took place according to the religion of her Protestant <lb/>
husband, in Holyrood, was a very sorry affair.</p>
<p>A terrible retribution for those mad days of <reg orig="self-|will">self-will</reg> <lb/>
and unbridled passion was at hand. Directly <lb/>
the marriage was over, Bothwell's real nature, his <lb/>
brutality and selfish ambition, seem to have been <lb/>
made clear; for on that wedding-day the newly-wed <lb/>
wife was heard to wish most passionately that she <lb/>
were dead.</p>
<p>Our next brief glimpse shows us the slopes of <lb/>
Carberry Hill, where she and Bothwell had led out <lb/>
their little army against the Lords, now in open and <lb/>
united revolt. The defence of the Queen was a <lb/>
wretched failure. Bothwell had no wish to fight <lb/>
against troops so superior in numbers. His wife <lb/>
dreaded beyond all things that he should come to <lb/>
harm. Delay after delay was set up, and at length, <lb/>
as the hostile Lords approached, she bade her husband <lb/>
flee and save himself at any cost. So he, caring as <lb/>
usual only for himself, kissed her hand, and riding <lb/>
off to Dunbar, passed out of her life for ever; for <lb/>
after taking ship from the coast, he was seized by a <lb/>
Danish vessel, taken to Denmark and thrown into <lb/>
a prison, where in solitary confinement he fretted <lb/>
his proud soul into madness, and so died.</p>
<p>The Queen returned to Edinburgh on that day, <lb/>
lonely and deserted, a prisoner in the hands of <lb/>
her subjects. Two days later she was incarcerated <lb/>
within the island fortress of Loch Leven &lpar;June <lb/>
1567&rpar;.</p>
<p>The position of Mary Stuart was now most <lb/>
<pb n="66" entity="b000514724_0091"/>
critical. She stood alone and a prisoner against <lb/>
her kingdom, which was clamouring for judgment <lb/>
upon her as a wife who had murdered her husband. <lb/>
Only the fact that some of the chief men of the <lb/>
land were implicated in her guilt saved her from a <lb/>
public trial. Even those who judged her most <lb/>
leniently insisted on immediate abdication in favour <lb/>
of her young son. At first she held out with all <lb/>
her wonted spirit; but she was not used to <lb/>
imprisonment, and the shock of the desertion of <lb/>
Bothwell as well as her anxiety about his safety <lb/>
had unnerved her. Sick in heart and body, she <lb/>
signed the deed, and the baby-prince was crowned <lb/>
as king in her stead.</p>
<p>But Mary was a hard prisoner to bind. That <lb/>
fascination "whereby men are bewitched" was still <lb/>
at work. The hostile Lords were amazed to hear in <lb/>
the October of her imprisonment that "she had won <lb/>
the favour and goodwill of all the household, as well <lb/>
women as men."</p>
<p>The grim lady of Loch Leven loved and pitied <lb/>
her, and two of her Maries still clung to her; but <lb/>
in two younger members of the Castle retinue, <lb/>
George and Willie Douglas, who acted as pages to <lb/>
the Laird, she found the most unbounded loyalty and <lb/>
devotion. Willie it was, who though but a boy of <lb/>
fourteen, planned and carried out a daring plan of <lb/>
escape, after a previous failure had banished his <lb/>
brother from the Castle. Lady Douglas herself, <lb/>
the Laird's mother, "was of the counsel," and <lb/>
possibly kept her son engaged in talk at the <reg orig="supper-|table">supper-table</reg> <lb/>
while the boy, who had deftly managed to get <lb/>
<pb n="67" entity="b000514724_0092"/>
hold of the keys, slipped out with two cloaked <lb/>
companions, and having locked the doors behind <lb/>
him and scuttled the other boats on the lake-side, <lb/>
succeeded in rowing them to the opposite shore.</p>
<p>What an exhilarating ride through the chill <lb/>
evening air that must have been! It landed Mary <lb/>
in a place of safety, where a certain number of her <lb/>
subjects gathered round her. Gallant they were, <lb/>
but hopelessly outnumbered in face of the grim <lb/>
troops who rose in support of the Protestant king. <lb/>
The Duke of Argyle, her main supporter, failed her <lb/>
at the crucial moment, and the field of Langside <lb/>
ended in absolute defeat.</p>
<p>For the first time Mary lost her head. Turning <lb/>
her horse from the field, and followed only by a tiny <lb/>
band of friends, she fled wildly towards the distant <lb/>
line which marked the Solway Firth. For sixty <lb/>
miles she rode, staying only to snatch a mouthful of <lb/>
oatcake and a drink of sour milk at a cottage door, <lb/>
and once to rest her aching limbs on the mud floor <lb/>
of an empty barn. Her one idea was to flee from <lb/>
the country which had kept her prisoner, and she <lb/>
never stayed to consider what her treatment was <lb/>
likely to be at the hands of her cousin Elizabeth. <lb/>
She was at least a cousin&mdash;a sister queen, and she <lb/>
hoped for that generosity of spirit in her which she <lb/>
would have shown herself in like case.</p>
<p>So she hastened across the Solway in a fisherman's <lb/>
boat&mdash;and never saw her native land again.</p>
<p>From that moment we may reckon that the real <lb/>
expiation of that terrible year that followed Riccio's <lb/>
murder began.</p>
<pb n="68" entity="b000514724_0093"/>
<p>For twenty years Mary of Scotland was to be a <lb/>
captive, but one who, like an imprisoned wild-bird, <lb/>
was always beating her wings against her cage. <lb/>
Elizabeth treated her ungenerously from the first. <lb/>
In answer to her appeal that clothes should be sent <lb/>
her,&mdash;"for I am in a piteous condition, not merely for <lb/>
a queen but for a simple gentlewoman, since I <lb/>
possess nothing in the world but what I stand <lb/>
up in,"&mdash;she sent her a pair of torn shifts, two <lb/>
small pieces of velvet, and two pairs of shoes. No <lb/>
wonder that Mary's silence "argued scorn rather <lb/>
than gratitude." Even the messenger who brought <lb/>
the parcel was ashamed, and muttered that the maid <lb/>
who packed the things must have made a mistake.</p>
<p>Then came the long and pointless farce of the <lb/>
Conference at York, which ended practically in a <lb/>
declaration that nothing had been proved against <lb/>
Murray and the Lords on one side, nor against Mary <lb/>
on the other. It was the ill-advised wish of the Duke <lb/>
of Norfolk, moved either by ambition or by romantic <lb/>
love for one he had never even seen, to marry the <lb/>
unfortunate Queen, that condemned Mary to <reg orig="life-|long">lifelong</reg> <lb/>
imprisonment. No movement, even of open <lb/>
rebellion, could have so prejudiced her in the eyes <lb/>
of Elizabeth. From prison to prison she was moved, <lb/>
and we can but take a few brief glimpses which show <lb/>
us Mary the woman now that the days of Mary as <lb/>
queen have passed away.</p>
<p>The first shows her to us at Tutbury Castle, <lb/>
guarded jealously by Lady Salisbury, the famous <lb/>
Bess of Hardwicke. A certain Mr. Nicholas <lb/>
Whyte, a visitor of the Earl her gaoler, had conceived <lb/>
<pb n="69" entity="b000514724_0094"/>
it to be his duty to go in and preach to the royal <lb/>
lady, enjoining on her a grateful spirit both to God <lb/>
and to the Queen of England, and "to think herself <lb/>
rather prince-like entertained than hardly restrained <lb/>
of anything that was fit for her Grace's estate."</p>
<p>This she "very gently accepted," but we can see <lb/>
the beautiful eyes wandering to the dilapidated walls <lb/>
and high windows of her prison as she answers with <lb/>
undetected irony, "that as for content in this her <lb/>
present state she would not require it at God's <lb/>
hands, but only patience, which she humbly <lb/>
prayed Him to give her."</p>
<p>He further inquires what she did all day. "She <lb/>
said that all the day she wrought with her needle, <lb/>
and that the diversity of the colours did make it <lb/>
seem less tedious, and continued so long at it till <lb/>
very pain did make her to give it over."</p>
<p>We next see her removed to Coventry, and there <lb/>
the news of the gallant, ill-fated Northern Rising <lb/>
brought to her hopes of freedom once again.</p>
<p>But the revolt ended in blood, and the Queen <lb/>
relapsed into a sad condition of disappointment and <lb/>
ill-health.</p>
<p>Feverish colds, constant pain in the side, and <lb/>
chronic rheumatism were the penalties she had to <lb/>
pay for lack of proper exercise and fresh air. Her <lb/>
only chance of keeping up was the excitement <lb/>
of conspiracy, and this became the very breath of <lb/>
her being.</p>
<p>In 1571 she was full of the hopes and fears <lb/>
aroused by the Ridolfi plot, which aimed at a <lb/>
Spanish invasion of the kingdom. Its discovery <lb/>
<pb n="70" entity="b000514724_0095"/>
led to a much more rigorous imprisonment. Her <lb/>
troop of faithful servants was dismissed; the few <lb/>
that remained might not go beyond the gates or <lb/>
speak to other members of the household; and she <lb/>
was not allowed to leave her rooms for any purpose <lb/>
save when Lord Shewsbury, her gaoler, took her to <lb/>
walk in his "large dining-room with himself or his <lb/>
wife in her company."</p>
<p>She herself seems to have wondered that they <lb/>
spared her life on this occasion; but brave as ever, <lb/>
she made no moan for herself. Her one anxiety <lb/>
was for the lot of those whom the fatal discovery <lb/>
had cast off friendless in a strange land. Especially <lb/>
she remembers the boy who had secured her escape <lb/>
from Loch Leven. "As for you, Willie Douglas," she <lb/>
writes, "be assured that the life you risked for mine <lb/>
shall never be destitute as long as I have a friend <lb/>
alive."</p>
<p>Then the long monotonous years rolled on. She <lb/>
had been but eight-and-twenty when her captivity <lb/>
began&mdash;a mere girl in years. But now she was <lb/>
ageing fast. The beautiful hair was grey, the face was <lb/>
lined and haggard. Only one of her faithful Maries <lb/>
remained to her. The rest of the once laughing <lb/>
little band were scattered by marriage or death. <lb/>
Mary Setoun was the last to go; and she left her <lb/>
royal mistress only two years before her end, and is <lb/>
thought to have become a nun. The devices for <lb/>
rendering the long grey days less wearisome are <lb/>
pathetic indeed. She delighted in her birds and <lb/>
spaniels, prisoners like herself without realising what <lb/>
freedom had meant. But her great joy in these <lb/>
<pb n="71" entity="b000514724_0096"/>
years was a charming little grandchild of Lady <lb/>
Shrewsbury. Little Bess Pierrepoint was her <reg orig="bed-|fellow">bedfellow</reg> <lb/>
and constant companion, bred up by her to <lb/>
every courtly accomplishment, and dressed by her <lb/>
with the most loving care.</p>
<p>Then once more the air grew thick with plots. <lb/>
The Roman Catholics of England naturally looked <lb/>
upon Mary as a martyr to her faith, and also as the <lb/>
rightful heir to the throne. It was impossible, in <lb/>
spite of the most rigid precautions, to keep her <lb/>
entirely out of communication with the outer world. <lb/>
Walsingham indeed gave her ample means to do so, <lb/>
in order that she might commit herself, and so <lb/>
hasten the inevitable end. Although removed <lb/>
under apparently much stricter ward at Tutbury, <lb/>
letters were constantly passing into the Castle, <lb/>
concealed in water-tight boxes, which were placed in <lb/>
the beer barrels brought in for her little household, <lb/>
most of which passed through Walsingham's hands.</p>
<p>Then a young Catholic gentleman, Anthony <lb/>
Babington, took up her cause. When matters had <lb/>
gone far enough, he wrote her a fatal letter, explaining <lb/>
in detail the plans for the projected invasion of <lb/>
England, for her rescue, and for the assassination of <lb/>
Elizabeth. This, too, was read by Walsingham's spies, <lb/>
and the answer was all their hearts could wish.</p>
<p>Another gallant gentleman went to swell the <lb/>
long list of those who fell as victims to their <lb/>
fascination for Mary Stuart&mdash;Riccio, Darnley, <lb/>
Bothwell, Norfolk, and now unhappy Anthony.</p>
<p>But the end had come for her as well as for him.</p>
<p>Removed to Fotheringay, and kept in utter <lb/>
<pb n="72" entity="b000514724_0097"/>
ignorance of what had been done or of how much <lb/>
had been really discovered, the ensuing days must <lb/>
have been a nightmare to Mary. But when she <lb/>
was brought face to face with the Commissioners <lb/>
sent to Fotheringay in order to secure a verdict of <lb/>
"guilty" against her, the old high spirit broke forth. <lb/>
Holding up before them a ring which she took from <lb/>
her finger, she cried to her judges and accusers, <lb/>
"Here, my lords, is the pledge of love and <reg orig="pro-|tection">protection</reg> <lb/>
which I received from your mistress. Look <lb/>
well at it. It was in reliance upon this that I came <lb/>
amongst you. Nobody knows better than <reg orig="your-|selves">yourselves</reg> <lb/>
how this pledge has been kept."</p>
<p>A ghastly interval elapsed. Sentence of death <lb/>
had been pronounced, but it remained to be seen <lb/>
whether Elizabeth would dare to carry it out. Still <lb/>
the monotonous days went on, and nothing more <lb/>
happened. And then of a sudden came the end.</p>
<p>The Queen had been ill with worry and anxiety, <lb/>
but she met the two noblemen who brought the <lb/>
fatal message with perfect composure. Quite bravely <lb/>
she said that "that soul was unworthy of the joys <lb/>
of heaven for ever whose body would not in this <lb/>
world be content to endure the stroke of the <lb/>
executioner for a moment." Then came a pause&mdash; <lb/>
and then, being but a woman though a brave one, <lb/>
"she wept bitterly and remained silent." They left <lb/>
her with a warning that she must be ready next <lb/>
morning at eight.</p>
<p>She set to work at once to cheer the drooping <lb/>
spirits of her "little flock," as she lovingly called her <lb/>
few companions. She insisted that they should join <lb/>
<pb n="73" entity="b000514724_0098"/>
her at supper, and afterwards carefully divided her <lb/>
jewels and clothes among them.</p>
<p>It was two o'clock in the morning before she was <lb/>
ready to take her rest. One of her ladies was asked <lb/>
to read her to sleep as usual from the Lives of the <lb/>
Saints, and was bidden to choose the life of a saint <lb/>
who had once been a great sinner. She faltered, <lb/>
and the Queen herself selected that of the penitent <lb/>
thief, saying, "In truth he was a great sinner, but <lb/>
not so great as I have been. I wish to take him <lb/>
for my patron for the time that remains to me. <lb/>
May my Saviour have mercy on me, remember me <lb/>
and have mercy on me as He had on him at the <lb/>
hour of his death."</p>
<p>Her ladies knelt weeping about her room that <lb/>
terrible night, but she lay quiet and still, and seemed <lb/>
to be praying. At six she rose and dressed with <lb/>
great care in petticoat and bodice of crimson velvet, <lb/>
over which she wore a black satin bodice, with a <lb/>
long furred satin train and hanging sleeves. On her <lb/>
head she wore a lawn cap with flowing white veil. <lb/>
Then all knelt in prayer, until a loud knocking told <lb/>
them that the hour had come. With cruel obtuseness, <lb/>
her gaoler, Sir Amyas Paulet, would have turned <lb/>
her servants back and left her to die alone. She <lb/>
was forced to plead with her old winning smile, <lb/>
"Alas, poor souls, it will do them good to bid me <lb/>
farewell, and I hope that your mistress, being a <lb/>
maiden queen, in regard of womanhood will suffer <lb/>
me to have some of my own people about me at <lb/>
my death."</p>
<p>It was grudgingly allowed, on condition that she <lb/>
<pb n="74" entity="b000514724_0099"/>
answered for them that they would make no <reg orig="dis-|turbance">disturbance</reg>; <lb/>
and so four of her gentlemen and two of <lb/>
her maids followed her into the hall. And within <lb/>
the folds of her long skirt a little dog crept close to <lb/>
his mistress's side.</p>
<p>In the hall stood a great platform, hung with <lb/>
black, on which were the two executioners in their <lb/>
black clothes and white aprons, standing before the <lb/>
draped block with the shining axe beside it. The <lb/>
Dean of Peterborough, even in those last moments, <lb/>
tried to exhort her to lay aside her "superstitions," <lb/>
but she replied firmly, "Mr. Dean, I am settled in <lb/>
the ancient Catholic religion, and mind to spend my <lb/>
life in defence of it."</p>
<p>She recited aloud the penitential psalms in Latin <lb/>
on her knees, and when she rose, the executioner <lb/>
approached and put out his hand to help her to <lb/>
remove her outer dress. "Let me do this," she said <lb/>
with a touch of irony mingled with her old <reg orig="gracious-|ness">graciousness</reg> <lb/>
to her inferiors; "I understand this business <lb/>
better than you: I never had such a groom of the <lb/>
chamber." Her sobbing women drew near, but she <lb/>
quieted them with a finger on their lip and a word, <lb/>
"Don't cry; I have promised for you." Then she <lb/>
kissed them, and stood up in her crimson under-robe, <lb/>
her white shoulders and beautiful neck all bare.</p>
<p>Clasping a crucifix in her hand, she allowed herself <lb/>
to be led to the low block. <hi rend="italic">"In manus tuas Domine <lb/>
me commendo!"</hi> she cried. Then the axe fell, and <lb/>
from the folds of the motionless body the little dog <lb/>
crept whimpering.</p>
<p>She had found no mercy at the hands of men. <lb/>
<pb n="75" entity="b000514724_0100"/>
We can but trust that at a higher tribunal her long <lb/>
punishment of twenty-one years' imprisonment, <lb/>
ending only in a shameful death, may have been <lb/>
accepted as an atonement for the sin of her <lb/>
passionate youth.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> name of "Port Royal" is famous in <lb/>
literature and history for many different <lb/>
reasons. It was the headquarters of the <lb/>
"Jansenists"&mdash;a sect within the Catholic Church <lb/>
opposed to the system of the Jesuits; it is <reg orig="con-|nected">connected</reg> <lb/>
with the famous names of St. Cyran, the <lb/>
great ecclesiastic; of Arnauld, the vigorous opponent <lb/>
of Jesuitry; of Pascal, the learned and witty man <lb/>
of letters; of Nicole, the philosopher, and many <lb/>
another of its band of "Solitaries"; and it gave to <lb/>
the world a famous system of education and of <lb/>
logic. But the name that shines brightest within <lb/>
its ruined walls is that of the single-minded, <lb/>
brave-hearted woman who undertook, in a <lb/>
time of incredible laxity and low moral standard, <lb/>
to reform not only the tone of her own convent, <lb/>
but indirectly that of all similar institutions in <lb/>
France.</p>
<p>As had been the case in England a hundred years <lb/>
earlier, the condition of monasteries and convents <lb/>
in France at the beginning of the seventeenth <lb/>
<pb n="78" entity="b000514724_0105"/>
century left very much to be desired. Most of <lb/>
these establishments were very wealthy, and it <lb/>
was the custom to try and attract well-to-do <lb/>
novices by the lack of discipline and the luxury of <lb/>
their arrangements.</p>
<p>The nuns passed their time in idleness, and vied <lb/>
with each other in the rich material of their <reg orig="con-|ventual">conventual</reg> <lb/>
dress. They wore masks out of doors <lb/>
to preserve their complexions, and starched linen <lb/>
ruffs over the regulation robe. They were often <lb/>
too frivolously employed to think of attending <lb/>
religious services, which were held very infrequently, <lb/>
for the priest in charge was generally a better <lb/>
huntsman than ecclesiastic.</p>
<p>But, curiously enough, it was from one of the <lb/>
chief abuses connected with these convents that <lb/>
the movement of reform sprang.</p>
<p>It was the scandalous custom to get appointed, <lb/>
through influence, to the post of Abbess of these <lb/>
establishments, young girls of noble families, quite <lb/>
unfit, of course, to fulfil their duties. This, however, <lb/>
did not prevent them from receiving large <reg orig="endow-|ments">endowments</reg>, <lb/>
which became the property of their parents <lb/>
during their minority.</p>
<p>It was in the year 1598, when Jacqueline <lb/>
Arnauld was seven years old, and her sister Jeanne <lb/>
just five, that their grandfather announced to them <lb/>
that the King had been graciously pleased to <lb/>
appoint the former to be assistant and successor <lb/>
to the Abbess of Port Royal, and the latter to <lb/>
be Abbess of St. Cyr.</p>
<p>Here was a fine prospect! Off ran the little <lb/>
<pb n="79" entity="b000514724_0106"/>
girls to announce their new dignities to their <lb/>
brothers and sisters. But presently came time for <lb/>
thought and comment from older members of the <lb/>
family, and this brought Jeanne back to her <reg orig="grand-|father's">grandfather's</reg> <lb/>
knee, saying, "They tell me, grandpapa, <lb/>
that an Abbess must answer to God for the souls <lb/>
of her nuns, and I think I shall have enough to do <lb/>
to answer for my own, so I would rather not be an <lb/>
Abbess."</p>
<p>"And you, Jacqueline?" asked the amused <lb/>
grandpapa.</p>
<p>"Oh, I will be Abbess," cried Jacqueline Arnauld, <lb/>
"but I will make my nuns do their duty!"</p>
<p>In those words the work of her life was strangely <lb/>
well foretold.</p>
<p>Meantime the two children were sent to different <lb/>
convents to be educated&mdash;Jeanne to her own <lb/>
establishment at St. Cyr, where she remained till <lb/>
she was old enough to "receive the veil" and <reg orig="under-|take">undertake</reg> <lb/>
the work of Abbess under the name of M&egrave;re <lb/>
Agnes.</p>
<p>Jacqueline, however, did not go to Port Royal for <lb/>
three years, and meantime was sent to the convent <lb/>
of Maubuisson, where she took the veil and became <lb/>
a professed nun, as M&egrave;re Ang&eacute;lique. Her <reg orig="in-|stallation">installation</reg> <lb/>
as Abbess of Port Royal was another <lb/>
instance of discreditable intrigue. The Pope <lb/>
happening to hear of the tender age of the proposed <lb/>
Abbess, refused to confirm her appointment; but <lb/>
her relations immediately petitioned that the office <lb/>
might be transferred from <hi rend="italic">Jacqueline to Ang&eacute;lique,</hi> <lb/>
whom they declared to be seventeen years of age. <lb/>
<pb n="80" entity="b000514724_0107"/>
A few months later, Jacqueline, then ten years old, <lb/>
was made Abbess of Port Royal.</p>
<p>Port Royal of the Fields, as it afterwards came <lb/>
to be called, was a very ancient convent, containing <lb/>
only twelve nuns, and was situated about twenty <lb/>
miles from Paris, in a wooded valley, with a marsh <lb/>
at the bottom. The rule was that of St. Benedict, <lb/>
and very strict; but it was scarcely recognised in <lb/>
any way. The nuns led a lazy and frivolous <lb/>
existence, held their own property, and dressed as <lb/>
fashionably as the robe of their order allowed. <lb/>
They were more than ready to pet and flatter the <lb/>
child Ang&eacute;lique, and were delighted when her <lb/>
sister Agnes, for some unknown reason, left St. Cyr <lb/>
and joined their little community. The children's <lb/>
parents visited them frequently, and everything was <lb/>
done to make the convent-life as bearable as <lb/>
possible.</p>
<p>But nothing would reconcile Ang&eacute;lique to such <lb/>
a lot. She loathed from the depths of her girlish <lb/>
heart the petty, monotonous life, the silly devices <lb/>
to avoid openly breaking a rule or to obtain some <lb/>
wished-for luxury, the trivial, ignorant conversation <lb/>
of the women by whom she was surrounded. She <lb/>
tried to console herself with reading romances, but <lb/>
these only made her more discontented with her <lb/>
own dismal lot.</p>
<p>When she was about fifteen, feeling she could <lb/>
stand the life no longer, she made a desperate plot <lb/>
to escape from the convent by night, to flee to the <lb/>
Huguenot town of La Rochelle, and to throw herself <lb/>
on the protection of some relations who lived within <lb/>
<pb n="81" entity="b000514724_0108"/>
the walls. Before she could carry out her plan, <lb/>
however, she fell very ill of fever, caused by the <lb/>
unhealthy marshes of the valley.</p>
<p>Her mother arrived, and quickly carried her off <lb/>
to her home in Paris, nursing her there with such <lb/>
tender care that Ang&eacute;lique began to reflect with <lb/>
shame on the trouble which her flight would bring <lb/>
upon her parents. And so, in chastened mood, she <lb/>
returned to her "prison" behind the doors of Port <lb/>
Royal. But it was no easier to endure than before, <lb/>
and gradually the girl withdrew herself more and <lb/>
more into the world of romance and imagination, <lb/>
resigning herself unwillingly to a life for which <lb/>
she had apparently no vocation whatever. Then, <lb/>
unmistakably, the call came. When she was <lb/>
seventeen years old, and had, one Lent, from very <lb/>
shame, laid aside her story-books for a while, she <lb/>
borrowed a book of devotions from a friend, and <lb/>
after studying it for some time, found herself for <lb/>
the first time deeply interested in the great truths <lb/>
of the Christian faith.</p>
<p>While she was still pondering these things, a <lb/>
stranger monk, passing through Port Royal, preached <lb/>
in the convent chapel a wonderful sermon on the <lb/>
glory of humiliation and self-surrender, which made <lb/>
of the careless, sullen girl from that moment an <lb/>
enthusiastic and devoted religious. It is <reg orig="char-|acteristic">characteristic</reg> <lb/>
of her earnest, sensible type of character <lb/>
that she did not allow her newly found fervour of <lb/>
devotion to carry her to all manner of extravagant <lb/>
practices. She realised the duty that lay straight <lb/>
before her, and said to herself&mdash;</p>
<pb n="82" entity="b000514724_0109"/>
<p>"I will reform myself first, and then my convent."</p>
<p>No easy task was hers. Her first idea was, that <lb/>
having taken a vow to observe the rule of St. <lb/>
Benedict, that rule ought to be kept most strictly <lb/>
by herself and all the nuns. This the latter at once <lb/>
opposed. They saw no need of reform. In <reg orig="com-|parison">comparison</reg> <lb/>
with many other convents, Port Royal was <lb/>
a pattern establishment. The idea of self-sacrifice <lb/>
and discipline was utterly repugnant to their minds. <lb/>
Finally, a report of fanaticism and imprudence was <lb/>
sent to Paris, which so alarmed M. Arnauld that <lb/>
he immediately sent for his daughter, took her into <lb/>
the country, and there lectured her on the foolishness <lb/>
of her whims and ideas, till she was reduced to <lb/>
silence and despair of ever making him understand <lb/>
her point of view.</p>
<p>He thought he had gained his point, and sent her <lb/>
back to Port Royal, telling the Prioress, whose <lb/>
position rendered her peculiarly sensitive to any <lb/>
measures of reform, that she would have no more <lb/>
trouble with Ang&eacute;lique. He was altogether <reg orig="mis-|taken">mistaken</reg>. <lb/>
The young Abbess had returned full of zeal <lb/>
and determination, in spite of the angry opposition <lb/>
with which she met.</p>
<p>Only one was on her side, and she was a little <lb/>
Sister called Anne, who as a novice had dragged <lb/>
about in misery with an ulcerated leg, fearing that <lb/>
if the troublesome ailment became known she would <lb/>
not be allowed to take the veil and become a <lb/>
permanent inmate of the house. One day she had <lb/>
come with many tears to the young Abbess, <reg orig="con-|fessed">confessed</reg> <lb/>
her anxiety, and begged her to have pity on <lb/>
<pb n="83" entity="b000514724_0110"/>
her. Ang&eacute;lique at once met her confidence with <lb/>
the fullest sympathy. She dressed the wound daily <lb/>
in secret, and never rested till the girl was well and <lb/>
able to take the veil without fear of refusal. From <lb/>
that time Sister Anne was her firmest supporter; but <lb/>
the other nuns, headed by the Prioress, were full of <lb/>
mingled alarm and rebellion at any notion of reform. <lb/>
All they thought about was their own comfort and <lb/>
enjoyment, and they showed their opposition in a <lb/>
hundred petty ways, that at length made Ang&eacute;lique <lb/>
ill with worry and anxiety.</p>
<p>To her relief, however, after a few days of sickness, <lb/>
the Prioress and another nun, who had been most <lb/>
troublesome, came to her bedside, saying they knew <lb/>
too well the cause of her breakdown, and that if <lb/>
she would only get well they would never oppose <lb/>
her again. With these members of the little <reg orig="com-|munity">community</reg> <lb/>
on her side, the battle was half won. The <lb/>
fiercest fight, however, raged over the Mother's wish <lb/>
that all private property should be given up and held <lb/>
in common. One by one they came reluctantly to <lb/>
the chapel and laid their possessions at Ang&eacute;lique's <lb/>
feet. But two refused altogether to obey. One of <lb/>
these had to leave the convent. The other, whose <lb/>
whole heart lay in the little garden which she had <lb/>
made her own, held out with alternate tears and <lb/>
sullenness for some months, till, touched by the <lb/>
Mother's patience and kindness, she brought her the <lb/>
key and laid it, weeping, in her lap.</p>
<p>It was a harder matter still to reconcile her own <lb/>
family to what they considered a senseless piece of <lb/>
girlish enthusiasm. Ang&eacute;lique considered the rule <lb/>
<pb n="84" entity="b000514724_0111"/>
of seclusion, which forbade nuns to see visitors except <lb/>
behind a grating, to be the foundation-stone of the <lb/>
life of retirement which the name of nun implied.</p>
<p>She told her mother this by letter, begging her <lb/>
not to take such restraint amiss. For some reason, <lb/>
Madame Arnauld forbore to tell her husband of <lb/>
what she considered her daughter's new freak, and <lb/>
allowed him to pay one of his frequent visits with <lb/>
her to the convent, and to be, in consequence, <reg orig="over-|come">overcome</reg> <lb/>
with rage when his daughter, sadly but firmly, <lb/>
refused them admittance to the interior of the <lb/>
convent. She begged her father to go to the parlour, <lb/>
where she would see him behind the grating and <lb/>
explain all; but he only overwhelmed her with <lb/>
reproaches, and ordered her to deliver to him her <lb/>
two younger sisters, Agnes and Marie Claire, then <lb/>
in her charge, intending to force an entrance the <lb/>
moment the gates were opened for them to pass <lb/>
out.</p>
<p>Ang&eacute;lique prevented this, however, by sending <lb/>
them out by a back door; and Agnes only increased <lb/>
his fury by gravely giving him a long list of reasons <lb/>
in support of her sister's conduct. The miserable <lb/>
scene was ended by Madame Arnauld turning her <lb/>
back with determination on the convent gates; but <lb/>
M. Arnauld, fiery of speech yet warm of heart, <lb/>
returned after a few steps had been taken, rushed <lb/>
into the parlour, and finding Ang&eacute;lique behind the <lb/>
grating, cried pathetically, "Farewell; and if you <lb/>
have any love for your heartbroken father, take care <lb/>
of your health, and do not kill yourself with <lb/>
austerities."</p>
<pb n="85" entity="b000514724_0112"/>
<p>This unexpected kindness made poor Ang&eacute;lique <lb/>
quite break down. She sank, sobbing and fainting, <lb/>
to the floor in a kind of fit, which so terrified her <lb/>
father that he never attempted to oppose her again. <lb/>
So his determination that she should take the veil for <lb/>
worldly reasons was curiously overruled for good; <lb/>
for in the course of years all his other five daughters, <lb/>
with some of their children, and his own wife after <lb/>
his death, became devout inmates of Port Royal.</p>
<p>"I will make my nuns do their duty!" So had <lb/>
said the seven-year-old Jacqueline; and the little <lb/>
M&egrave;re Ang&eacute;lique at the age of eighteen was determined <lb/>
to carry out her scheme of reform. She was wise <lb/>
beyond her years, for she made no sudden changes, <lb/>
and always led the way to the sacrifice herself. <lb/>
Thus she lived for months without meat before she <lb/>
revived the old rule of a purely vegetable diet. She <lb/>
declined conversation during certain hours of the day <lb/>
for some time before enforcing the rule of silence <lb/>
at fixed hours, and the refraining from idle chatter at <lb/>
all times. She substituted coarse earthenware cups <lb/>
and plates for the porcelain table services, and serge <lb/>
for the fine linen used by the nuns for their <reg orig="under-|clothing">underclothing</reg>. <lb/>
Embroidery frames and tapestry needles <lb/>
were packed away, and the nuns began to busy <lb/>
themselves in making clothes for the poor, nursing <lb/>
the sick, and teaching the children sent to them for <lb/>
education.</p>
<p>All this movement of reform represented the hard <lb/>
and unceasing work of eight long years; and when <lb/>
Port Royal had acquired the reputation of a model <lb/>
convent with a model head, the General of the <lb/>
<pb n="86" entity="b000514724_0113"/>
Cistercian Order determined to extend M&egrave;re <lb/>
Ang&eacute;lique's influence in another direction.</p>
<p>The convent of Maubuisson, where Ang&eacute;lique <lb/>
had lived as a child, was ruled over by a woman <lb/>
named Madame d'Estrees, who made no pretence <lb/>
of living the life of a nun, and had encouraged <lb/>
those under her charge to lay aside every vestige of <lb/>
the religious life.</p>
<p>They knew nothing whatever of the faith which <lb/>
they professed. Most of their days were spent in <lb/>
playing cards, and their evenings in dancing with <lb/>
the monks of a neighbouring monastery. They <lb/>
were not really vicious women, but hopelessly ignorant, <lb/>
and content to lead an easy life without troubling <lb/>
themselves about this world or the next. Finding <lb/>
that remonstrances had no effect on the worldly and <lb/>
evil-minded Abbess, the General at length resorted <lb/>
to violent measures, sent down a body of archers, <lb/>
and forcibly removed the lady to a penitentiary.</p>
<p>It was to the difficult task of succeeding this <lb/>
wretched woman that M&egrave;re Ang&eacute;lique found herself <lb/>
called at the age of twenty-seven. The nuns <lb/>
dreaded her arrival; and she, accompanied by her <lb/>
young sister, Marie Claire, and two other Port <lb/>
Royal nuns, entered the convent of Maubuisson <lb/>
with fear and trembling. She found herself among <lb/>
well-known faces, however, for several of the <lb/>
Sisters had been her companion-novices; and to <lb/>
their astonishment she at once embraced them, and <lb/>
called them by the childish names of former days. <lb/>
Still they regarded her with shrinking dread, as one <lb/>
who had come to deal out punishment with no <lb/>
<pb n="87" entity="b000514724_0114"/>
sparing hand, and they could scarcely be made <lb/>
to understand that she wished to rule them by love, <lb/>
not fear. Once again she began by setting them <lb/>
an example of self-surrender. She would not go <lb/>
near the richly furnished apartments of Madame <lb/>
d'Estrees, but took up her abode in the smallest <lb/>
and darkest cell, while her bed was a mattress of <lb/>
straw, without any covering save her robe of <lb/>
religion.</p>
<p>To the amazement of the nuns, she sent away <lb/>
the servants, and helped to sweep, dig, wash dishes, <lb/>
and clean floors herself; and first and foremost <lb/>
she insisted upon the observance of the rule of <lb/>
seclusion, of which some of them had never even <lb/>
heard.</p>
<p>It soon became evident that the wretched tone <lb/>
of the place must be raised by a large admixture <lb/>
of outsiders. Her reputation had already brought <lb/>
a crowd of novices to the doors of the convent. <lb/>
From these she chose thirty, whom, with the help <lb/>
of her Port Royal nuns, she trained in religion and <lb/>
in habits of order and self-discipline. Gradually <lb/>
some of the older nuns were won over by her <lb/>
patient kindness, and all seemed to be progressing <lb/>
well on the road to reform.</p>
<p>Suddenly one day, as the young Mother was <lb/>
passing from one part of the convent to another, she <lb/>
came face to face with Madame d'Estrees. Her <lb/>
astonishment may be imagined, but she received <lb/>
her with respect, and when ordered roughly to take <lb/>
the late Abbess to her old apartments, quietly led <lb/>
the way thither. But Madame d'Estrees found, to <lb/>
<pb n="88" entity="b000514724_0115"/>
her extreme annoyance, that her rooms had been <lb/>
stripped of all their fine hangings and converted into <lb/>
a hospital for the sick nuns. Venting her disgust <lb/>
in no measured terms, she bade Ang&eacute;lique order <lb/>
dinner for her; and the latter gladly departed, <lb/>
much exercised as to what this proceeding <reg orig="im-|plied">implied</reg>.</p>
<p>She discovered later that the wretched woman, <lb/>
having escaped from her penitentiary, had been <lb/>
admitted by an accomplice within the convent walls, <lb/>
and even at that moment had confederates in the <lb/>
shape of her worthless brother-in-law, the Count de <lb/>
Sanz&eacute;, with his followers, waiting outside the gates <lb/>
to restore her to her old position by force. Scarcely <lb/>
had Ang&eacute;lique finished her frugal meal with the <lb/>
novices, than Madame d'Estrees sent for her and <lb/>
ordered her to depart at once from the convent. <lb/>
To this she quietly replied that she could not go <lb/>
until her superiors ordered her to do so. In vain <lb/>
her adversary threatened and reproached her. The <lb/>
young Abbess was quietly but firmly determined.</p>
<p>The time came for evensong, and everyone went <lb/>
to the chapel. In the midst of the service, as <lb/>
Ang&eacute;lique knelt at her stall, one of the nuns <lb/>
suddenly threw open a side door opening on the <lb/>
outside wall of the building, and Madame d'Estrees, <lb/>
seizing her rival by the arms, endeavoured to push <lb/>
her through the doorway. Some of the novices <lb/>
rushed to Ang&eacute;lique's help, and not handling <lb/>
Madame d'Estrees as gently as they might, the <lb/>
latter screamed for aid. Immediately the Count <lb/>
and his men rushed into the chapel with drawn <lb/>
<pb n="89" entity="b000514724_0116"/>
swords, and failing in their attempt to terrify the <lb/>
Abbess into flight, proceeded to drag her out by <lb/>
force. Most of the novices and some of the elder <lb/>
nuns rushed out after her before the door could be <lb/>
closed, and clinging to her robe, besought her not to <lb/>
leave them.</p>
<p>Bidding them be of good cheer, for God was on <lb/>
their side, the Abbess placed the thirty helpless, <lb/>
homeless women two and two; and so, in solemn <lb/>
and not undignified procession, passed with them <lb/>
into the nearest town, and entering the first church <lb/>
to which they came, took up their abode there and <lb/>
awaited events. The inhabitants quickly made <lb/>
themselves acquainted with the whole affair, and <lb/>
public opinion was strongly on their side. A house <lb/>
was offered to them; food and furniture was placed <lb/>
at their disposal; and the little band of religious <lb/>
were soon settled in, and keeping their rule as <lb/>
usual.</p>
<p>The evil reign of Madame d'Estrees was not a <lb/>
long one. A body of troops was sent to remove <lb/>
her, but these she managed to elude by concealing <lb/>
herself in the neighbourhood of the convent.</p>
<p>Meantime the General of the Order insisted that <lb/>
Ang&eacute;lique and her nuns should return. The nuns <lb/>
were terrified, for none knew when Madame d'Estrees, <lb/>
thirsting for revenge, might not descend upon them; <lb/>
and her followers were still on the alert, roaming <lb/>
round the convent by night, firing through the <lb/>
windows, and keeping the poor women in a state of <lb/>
nervous dread that can be readily imagined. They <lb/>
implored that a guard might be set; but Ang&eacute;lique <lb/>
<pb n="90" entity="b000514724_0117"/>
would not hear of it, bidding them trust in God <lb/>
rather than in man. At length, Madame d'Estrees <lb/>
was taken and put into prison; from thence, on her <lb/>
release, she sank into a condition of utter <reg orig="degrada-|tion">degradation</reg> <lb/>
and misery, and never troubled Maubuisson again.</p>
<p>The five years in which M&egrave;re Ang&eacute;lique ruled <lb/>
over this convent were those of incessant toil, <lb/>
worry, and anxiety, and she was thankful to find <lb/>
at the end of that time that a new Abbess <lb/>
was appointed and that she might return to Port <lb/>
Royal.</p>
<p>She had little earthly reward for her labour of <lb/>
reform, for her successor was by no means of her <lb/>
mind, and began at once to cavil at part of her <lb/>
work by grumbling at the number of novices without <lb/>
dowry whom Ang&eacute;lique, caring more for character <lb/>
than riches, had admitted. "Madame," replied the <lb/>
Abbess with spirit, "if the wealthy convent of <lb/>
Maubuisson cannot afford to support these poor <lb/>
Sisters, the little community of Port Royal will gladly <lb/>
receive them."</p>
<p>So the gates of Port Royal were thrown open to <lb/>
thirty nuns and novices, with Ang&eacute;lique at their <lb/>
head, by those who had first learnt to despise <lb/>
earthly riches from the teaching and example of <lb/>
their Mother.</p>
<p>M&egrave;re Ang&eacute;lique's work of reform was by no means <lb/>
finished. She visited and personally superintended <lb/>
several other convents of the Cistercian Order, <lb/>
restoring the ancient rule, and reorganising their <lb/>
management, until at length her fame was so widely <lb/>
spread that the number of novices who applied for <lb/>
<pb n="91" entity="b000514724_0118"/>
admission to her own domain at Port Royal <reg orig="com-|pletely">completely</reg> <lb/>
overwhelmed its slender resources. The <lb/>
house was very unhealthy, small, badly built, and <lb/>
full of miasma from the marshes close by.</p>
<p>At this crisis, Madame Arnauld, now a rich <lb/>
widow, presented them with a beautiful house and <lb/>
grounds in Paris. Chapel and cloisters were added <lb/>
by wealthy friends, and in 1625 Port Royal of <lb/>
Paris became the headquarters of the community, <lb/>
which now included the whole of the female side <lb/>
of the Arnauld family. This change was not <lb/>
altogether advantageous. The Port Royalists, under <lb/>
Ang&eacute;lique's sane and healthy direction, had been <lb/>
noted for their sober, common-sense piety. The <lb/>
atmosphere of Paris, and the influence of a different <lb/>
order of priests upon the nuns, tended to introduce <lb/>
a kind of extravagant fervour into their devotions, <lb/>
which led to many superstitions and much want of <lb/>
balance.</p>
<p>It may have been from this cause, or possibly <lb/>
because, in her humility, she did not feel she was <lb/>
the right person to cope with this new spirit, that <lb/>
Ang&eacute;lique, having obtained permission from the <lb/>
Crown for the convent to elect an Abbess every <lb/>
three years, now resigned her office. The path of <lb/>
the active reformer who has laid aside her authority <lb/>
is no easy one. The new Abbess, M&egrave;re Genevi&egrave;ve, <lb/>
not only proceeded to undo most of the work of <lb/>
twenty years by restoring a style of luxurious living, <lb/>
but altered the whole tone of the place by throwing <lb/>
open the chapel to the public, engaging popular <lb/>
preachers, introducing gorgeous ceremonial, and <lb/>
<pb n="92" entity="b000514724_0119"/>
worst of all, limiting her novices to those who <lb/>
possessed wealth and were of noble birth.</p>
<p>It was hard to look on and see all this, but <lb/>
harder still to endure with meekness the personal <lb/>
treatment that Ang&eacute;lique now received. Forced to <lb/>
become a novice again after her twenty years of <lb/>
rule, that she might "learn how to obey," obliged <lb/>
to wear a paper mask in token of her "hypocrisy," <lb/>
led round the refectory with a basket of filth tied to <lb/>
her neck as an emblem of her "perverse mind," <lb/>
made to listen to an utterly false record of her own <lb/>
life in perfect silence, she learned to drink the deepest <lb/>
cup of humiliation.</p>
<p>Possibly, in her warmth of religious fervour, such <lb/>
an experience was to her a spiritual joy. She <lb/>
seems, at any rate, to have accepted it with the <lb/>
utmost resignation, since a word of complaint from <lb/>
one so closely allied to the chief benefactors of Part <lb/>
Royal, one, too, who was so highly esteemed by <lb/>
the Archbishop of Paris, would, we imagine, have <lb/>
been enough to bring this apparent persecution to <lb/>
an end.</p>
<p>After about three years of this treatment, Ang&eacute;lique <lb/>
was appointed Abbess of the new convent of the Holy <lb/>
Sacrament, but she soon found that even the degrading <lb/>
penances of Port Royal were preferable to being head <lb/>
of an establishment where she had scarcely any real <lb/>
authority, where a life of ease and comfort for <lb/>
ladies of high rank was the one aim, and where the <lb/>
Prioress was her open adversary.</p>
<p>She endured this for a time, but finding that <lb/>
reform was quite hopeless, she at length obtained <lb/>
<pb n="93" entity="b000514724_0120"/>
leave to resign in favour of M&egrave;re Genevi&egrave;ve, and <lb/>
hastened back to Port Royal, where her sister Agnes <lb/>
had now been made Abbess. It was no light task <lb/>
to restore the convent to its old simplicity and <lb/>
restraint, but in their efforts the two sisters had <lb/>
now the valuable aid of the Abb&eacute; de St. Cyran, <lb/>
the friend of Jansen, who played so notable a part <lb/>
in the attempt made to substitute a more simple <lb/>
and spiritual form of faith for the elaborate and <lb/>
intricate system of the Jesuits.</p>
<p>From this time Port Royal became the <reg orig="head-|quarters">head-quarters</reg> <lb/>
of the Jansenist doctrines, and they were <lb/>
supported most warmly by the members of another <lb/>
community who now claimed to be also recognised <lb/>
as Port Royalists. The deserted valley of Port <lb/>
Royal of the Fields had been taken possession of by <lb/>
a little company of "Solitaries" during the absence <lb/>
of the nuns. They were men of the world, bound <lb/>
by no vow, who wished to live a life of poverty <lb/>
and self-denial, and numbered among themselves <lb/>
Arnauld, the brother of Ang&eacute;lique, a brilliant <lb/>
speaker and writer, her three nephews, the celebrated <lb/>
philosopher Nicole, Pascal, the witty and spiritual <lb/>
writer of the <hi rend="italic">Provincial Letters</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Thoughts</hi>, <lb/>
and many other distinguished men.</p>
<p>Filled with that spirit of charity and reform which <lb/>
Ang&eacute;lique had left within the ruined walls of the <lb/>
convent, these recluses set to work to rebuild the <lb/>
house, drain the valley, and establish schools for <lb/>
rich and poor. One distinguished physician attended <lb/>
the poor in the neighbourhood; others passed their <lb/>
time in digging, building, or teaching. Their <lb/>
<pb n="94" entity="b000514724_0121"/>
schools soon became so famous that they had to <lb/>
refuse admission; and their reputation, together <lb/>
with the fact that they held and taught openly the <lb/>
doctrines of "Jansenism," quickly brought upon them <lb/>
the hatred and jealousy of the Jesuits.</p>
<p>This is not the place to tell the interesting story <lb/>
of the struggle between them, nor of how St. Cyran <lb/>
was imprisoned for his zeal and died soon after <lb/>
his release. The Solitaries only enter the life of <lb/>
M&egrave;re Ang&eacute;lique in so far as they helped to make <lb/>
the name of Port Royal still more famous. It <lb/>
became noted especially for the education given <lb/>
there, in the girls' schools managed by the nuns in <lb/>
Paris, and in those for boys in the valley, and for <lb/>
the literary ability shown by both sides of the <lb/>
community.</p>
<p>In 1648, when M&egrave;re Ang&eacute;lique was nearly <lb/>
sixty years of age, she obtained leave to depart <lb/>
from the crowded convent in Paris and to return <lb/>
with a tiny band of nuns to her first home at Port <lb/>
Royal. The Solitaries had by this time removed <lb/>
to new quarters on the edge of the valley, and they, <lb/>
together with the poor of the neighbourhood, united <lb/>
in a hearty welcome to the returning branch of the <lb/>
community. They came just in time to relieve by <lb/>
their charity the terrible distress caused by the <lb/>
War of the Fronde in the neighbourhood of Paris <lb/>
and Port Royal. When the hedges were full of <lb/>
starving people, and all was plunder and pillage, <lb/>
it was to the Port Royalists that the peasants <lb/>
instinctively turned.</p>
<p>"Our domitories and the chapter-house are full <lb/>
<pb n="95" entity="b000514724_0122"/>
of horses," wrote M&egrave;re Ang&eacute;lique; "&hellip; we concealed <lb/>
as many of the peasants and their cattle as we <lb/>
could in our monastery, to save them from being <lb/>
murdered and losing all their substance. Our <lb/>
laundry is thronged with the aged, the blind, the <lb/>
lame, and infants. Our convent is threatened with <lb/>
an attack every day; but God protects us, and we <lb/>
are at peace."</p>
<p>Scarcely had this war ended when another of a <lb/>
different kind began for Port Royal. The rage <lb/>
of the Jesuits against the growing and influential <lb/>
Jansenists showed itself in a furious attack made <lb/>
upon the whole party. An order was made that <lb/>
the Solitaries were to be expelled and their schools <lb/>
closed, and scarcely was this done when a threat <lb/>
of similar treatment was received at the convent.</p>
<p>But Port Royal, as far as the nuns were concerned, <lb/>
was saved by a very curious and apparently <lb/>
miraculous occurrence.</p>
<p>Much controversy has raged round the Miracle <lb/>
of the Holy Thorn, but one thing at least is clear <lb/>
concerning it. A little pupil in the Paris <reg orig="com-|munity">community</reg>, <lb/>
suffering from what was then considered <lb/>
as a hopeless disease of the eye and nose, was <lb/>
cured in a marvellously short time, and, as was <lb/>
reported, by the touch of a thorn from Our Lord's <lb/>
crown, which had been brought by a priest to the <lb/>
convent.</p>
<p>The apparent miracle was closely investigated, <lb/>
and was received by a large number of people as a <lb/>
clear mark that Heaven was on the side of the Port <lb/>
Royalists. Probably there is a medical explanation <lb/>
<pb n="96" entity="b000514724_0123"/>
of the matter which was unknown to the science of <lb/>
those days, but at any rate it came in time to save <lb/>
the convent for a while. It brought with it, <reg orig="more-|over">moreover</reg>, <lb/>
a tide of popularity and celebrity which was <lb/>
extremely dangerous, and against which M&egrave;re <lb/>
Ang&eacute;lique uttered a most decided protest. It was <lb/>
of no use, however, and she was obliged to be <lb/>
content to keep the country branch of the <reg orig="com-|munity">community</reg> <lb/>
within more restrained limits.</p>
<p>But the storm was only averted for a while.</p>
<p>When Ang&eacute;lique was in her seventieth year, an <lb/>
order arrived condemning the Port Royalists, who <lb/>
had unanimously refused to retract their doctrines, <lb/>
and ordering all scholars and novices to be sent <lb/>
away from both the Paris and country convents. <lb/>
An urgent message summoned the aged Mother to <lb/>
Paris. Taking a solemn farewell of the troubled <lb/>
little band of nuns, she left Port Royal of the Fields, <lb/>
and was carried in a litter to the larger <reg orig="establish-|ment">establishment</reg>, <lb/>
which she found in the greatest confusion and <lb/>
distress. Crowds of young novices and pupils <lb/>
pressed round her, imploring not to be sent back to <lb/>
the world of which they knew so little. "Keep us <lb/>
even as servants!" they cried. But M&egrave;re Ang&eacute;lique <lb/>
answered with her usual sunny faith, "What mean <lb/>
these tears, my children? Have you no faith? <lb/>
Trust in God and fear Him only, and all will go <lb/>
well."</p>
<p>Calmed by these brave words, they began <reg orig="sorrow-|fully">sorrowfully</reg> <lb/>
to disperse, not realising how the departure of <lb/>
each of them was tearing at the heart-strings of <lb/>
their Mother. One of their parents, indeed, <reg orig="compli-|mented">complimented</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="97" entity="b000514724_0124"/>
Ang&eacute;lique on the courage with which she <lb/>
bore her troubles.</p>
<p>"Madame," she replied, "when there is no longer <lb/>
a God in heaven, I shall begin to lose heart."</p>
<p>A time of great anxiety, constant worry, and <lb/>
harassing business arrangements now began, which <lb/>
in a month's time proved too much for her worn-out <lb/>
frame. She fainted one day on leaving chapel, and <lb/>
was carried to her bed, from which she never rose <lb/>
again.</p>
<p>During the two months of agonising illness that <lb/>
followed she never ceased to carry on her work. <lb/>
She had always been a quick, energetic woman, <lb/>
so vehement indeed in her ways that many people <lb/>
were startled and repelled. But to the poor and <lb/>
timid and penitent, M&egrave;re Ang&eacute;lique was the gentlest <lb/>
of mothers, and so she was found during this time <lb/>
of anxiety, as she lay directing the affairs of the <lb/>
convent from her sickbed. At length the end grew <lb/>
very near. Her last effort was to dictate a letter <lb/>
to the queen - mother, explaining the position of <lb/>
the Port Royal nuns and their reasons for refusing <lb/>
to retract their principles of faith&mdash;a letter so clear <lb/>
and forcible that the Court would not believe that <lb/>
it came from the brain of a dying woman in the <lb/>
midst of terrible suffering. "Now," she said, when <lb/>
it was finished, "my earthly business is done."</p>
<p>She died in the days of impending ruin and <lb/>
desolation for her beloved Port Royal; but her <lb/>
words were true.</p>
<p>Her work had been done, and well done. The <lb/>
example of Port Royal had raised the moral standard <lb/>
<pb n="98" entity="b000514724_0125"/>
of all the convents in France, besides restoring the <lb/>
ancient Cistercian rule to its former high position. <lb/>
Moreover, the influence of the devoted M&egrave;re <lb/>
Ang&eacute;lique had made the name of Port Royal <lb/>
famous throughout Europe for self-devotion and <lb/>
discipline, as well as for intellectual excellence. <lb/>
She had "made her nuns do their duty," and <lb/>
though Port Royal passed away, the name of <lb/>
this brave and steadfast nun will be recorded <lb/>
among those of all famous women.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> news of the birth of a little Princess of <lb/>
the house of Hapsburg in 1717 was <lb/>
received by her father, the Emperor Charles VI., <lb/>
with undisguised dismay. For a royal Prince had <lb/>
been earnestly hoped for, who would succeed without <lb/>
opposition to the various kingdoms combined under <lb/>
the empire of Germany, and would use his <lb/>
sword if necessary against those who stood in his <lb/>
way.</p>
<p>The very thought of a girl being placed in such <lb/>
an exalted and dangerous position was alarming; <lb/>
for in those days Europe was in a most unsettled <lb/>
state. Kingdom was watching kingdom with <lb/>
greedy eyes. France was always on the lookout <lb/>
to enlarge her territories, Russia was a dangerous, <lb/>
Poland an uncertain neighbour for Germany; and <lb/>
the unusual fact of the succession of a Queen would <lb/>
give all these countries an opportunity to try and <lb/>
<pb n="100" entity="b000514724_0129"/>
seize some part of her possessions or to contest <lb/>
her right to succeed to them at all.</p>
<p>So the Emperor looked sadly into the future, and <lb/>
hoped in vain for a sturdy son. By the time the <lb/>
little Marie Th&eacute;r&egrave;se was seven years old, however, <lb/>
her bright little mind and determined character had <lb/>
convinced her father that his daughter would be no <lb/>
weak and frightened woman to give way before the <lb/>
first attack of her foes, but would be one to be <lb/>
reckoned with by both enemies and friends. So <lb/>
he began to do everything in his power to <reg orig="safe-|guard">safeguard</reg> <lb/>
her interests, and when he at length hit <lb/>
upon the settlement known as the "Pragmatic <lb/>
Sanction," it seemed as though her future would <lb/>
be fairly well assured.</p>
<p>By this agreement the right of a woman to <lb/>
succeed to all the different parts of the empire was <lb/>
distinctly declared to be the law of the land, and <lb/>
all the most powerful European countries&mdash;England, <lb/>
Spain, Russia, Prussia, Poland, and France&mdash;after <lb/>
much bribery and haggling over terms, promised to <lb/>
uphold the succession of the young Princess.</p>
<p>When she was nineteen, Marie Th&eacute;r&egrave;se married <lb/>
Francis, Grand Duke of Tuscany. The marriage <lb/>
proved most happy, and although Francis seems <lb/>
by nature to have been more fitted to take the <lb/>
second place, his brilliant wife never ceased to <lb/>
put him first in her own mind and to fight her <lb/>
hardest for his position and his rights.</p>
<p>But in the year 1740, when Marie Th&eacute;r&egrave;se, now <lb/>
twenty-four years of age, succeeded to the throne, <lb/>
there was no thought of fighting. Tall and finely <lb/>
<pb n="101" entity="b000514724_0130"/>
made, with an oval face, thick golden hair, a nose <lb/>
slightly aquiline, and clear bright eyes, the beautiful <lb/>
young Queen thought more of dancing and courtly <lb/>
entertainments than of the sword and the <reg orig="battle-|field">battlefield</reg>. <lb/>
Her people of Vienna, the seat of the <lb/>
Austrian Court, almost worshipped her; and <lb/>
indeed her bright, lively manner, her generosity, <lb/>
her quick recognition of kindness, and withal her <lb/>
majestic appearance, made her a Queen for whom <lb/>
it was a joy to live and die. There was no whisper <lb/>
of trouble in the air, but rather such a sense of <lb/>
security that the Imperial army had been largely <lb/>
reduced.</p>
<p>Among the foremost to congratulate her on her <lb/>
accession, with many promises of friendship and <reg orig="sup-|port">support</reg>, <lb/>
had been Frederick, King of Prussia, known <lb/>
to us as Frederick the Great. Now the kingdom <lb/>
of Prussia owed its very existence to the timely <lb/>
help of the late Emperor, so that it was small <lb/>
wonder that Frederick should have been one of <lb/>
the first to offer his alliance and fealty. Imagine, <lb/>
then, the horrified surprise of the Empress when <lb/>
like a thunderclap the news arrived that, little <lb/>
more than a month after her accession, Frederick <lb/>
had marched a large army into Silesia, one of her <lb/>
richest and most important provinces, and was <lb/>
prepared to take it by force.</p>
<p>Before she could realise the truth, a Prussian <lb/>
ambassador appeared at the Austrian Court, and <lb/>
being admitted to the presence of the Grand Duke <lb/>
Francis, brought a proposal from his master that <lb/>
the whole of the provinces of which Silesia was <lb/>
<pb n="102" entity="b000514724_0131"/>
composed should be given up to him, in return <lb/>
for which he would protect the other Austrian <lb/>
dominions from attack.</p>
<p>"What!" cried the Austrian secretary, when he <lb/>
heard of this barefaced demand, "this fellow's <lb/>
father had to present to the Emperor the basin for <lb/>
washing his hands, and now would the son dictate <lb/>
terms to the daughter!"</p>
<p>The ambassador had also brought a private <lb/>
letter for Francis from Frederick, in which the <lb/>
latter pressed him to use his authority with his <lb/>
wife and get her to agree to his demands, urging <lb/>
the terrible consequences that would otherwise <lb/>
ensue, and ending with the words, "If the Grand <lb/>
Duke wishes to ruin himself, let him refuse."</p>
<p>For the moment, Francis, loth to embroil the <lb/>
newly made Empress in war, hesitated. "The <lb/>
Queen will never make disgraceful terms!" <reg orig="ex-|claimed">exclaimed</reg> <lb/>
the Chancellor, who stood by; and the <lb/>
offer was promptly rejected.</p>
<p>And thus began the terrible Silesian War. The <lb/>
Queen was more than ready,&mdash;her great wish, indeed, <lb/>
was to command her armies in person,&mdash;but she did <lb/>
not realise the inadequacy of her numbers, nor the <lb/>
strength of Frederick's troops. Everywhere the <lb/>
Austrians were defeated, and Silesia was soon in <lb/>
Prussian hands. An attempt to drive them out <lb/>
ended in such a disastrous defeat at Mollwitz <lb/>
in 1741 that the way to Vienna lay open to the <lb/>
foe, the Viennese fled from the city, and the <lb/>
Imperial family, with the treasure and the archives <lb/>
of the Court, were forced to betake themselves to <lb/>
<pb n="103" entity="b000514724_0132"/>
the castle of Gratz. But this was not all. While <lb/>
the fate of the capital hung in the balance, the <lb/>
great province of Bavaria revolted against Marie <lb/>
Th&eacute;r&egrave;se, and was immediately joined as an ally <lb/>
by France.</p>
<p>Marching into Bohemia, another of the Austrian <lb/>
provinces, they seized Prague, the capital, and <lb/>
declared Charles, the Elector of Bavaria, to be its <lb/>
independent King.</p>
<p>Now this meant not only the loss of a great part <lb/>
of the empire, it came also as an encouragement <lb/>
to other provinces to rebel. One of the largest and <lb/>
most unsettled of these was Hungary, whose people, <lb/>
many of whom were of gipsy race, were famous for <lb/>
their turbulence and restlessness.</p>
<p>It was at this crisis that the pluck and good <lb/>
sense of the Empress shone forth. Declaring that <lb/>
she would be crowned at Pressburg, the chief town <lb/>
of Hungary, she hurried, weak and frail though she <lb/>
was, almost immediately after the birth of her son, <lb/>
to that city. Amid the brilliant coloured dresses <lb/>
and dark wild faces of the Magyar chiefs, she was <lb/>
crowned and robed with the royal robe of St. <lb/>
Stephen of Hungary, whilst an excited and turbulent <lb/>
crowd swayed and muttered outside.</p>
<p>No one could tell that they were not meditating <lb/>
instant insurrection, but with dauntless courage the <lb/>
Queen only left the hall of coronation to mount a <lb/>
great black war-horse, and riding up the Mount of <lb/>
Defiance, just outside the city, she drew the sword <lb/>
with which she had girded herself, and pointed it <lb/>
north, south, east, and west, while in glowing words <lb/>
<pb n="104" entity="b000514724_0133"/>
she dared the whole world to deprive her of her <lb/>
inheritance. A roar of delight followed hard upon <lb/>
her words. She had won the hearts of the multitude, <lb/>
and as she rode back, smiling at them with pale <lb/>
but firmly controlled lips, she could scarcely advance <lb/>
for the way in which they pressed around her <lb/>
charger.</p>
<p>When the Hungarian Parliament met immediately <lb/>
after to consider their future line of conduct, the <lb/>
young Empress, dressed in deep mourning for her <lb/>
father, took her seat in their midst, and in an <reg orig="im-|passioned">impassioned</reg> <lb/>
speech threw herself and her child upon <lb/>
their protection.</p>
<p>"The kingdom of Hungary," she cried, "our royal <lb/>
person, our child, our crown, are all at stake. <lb/>
Deserted by everyone, we throw ourselves, as our <lb/>
only support, on the loyalty of these illustrious <lb/>
States."</p>
<p>Stirred to the depths by these words, and by the <lb/>
beautiful pale face of the young Queen, the deputies <lb/>
sprang to their feet, drew their swords, and vowed to <lb/>
devote their lives to her service. In her relief, for <lb/>
the first time Marie Th&eacute;r&egrave;se gave way, and sinking <lb/>
upon her seat, she wept bitterly. But she soon <lb/>
recovered herself, and sealed the allegiance of the <lb/>
shifting, wayward mob outside, when a few days <lb/>
later she appeared once more in the great Hall full <lb/>
of deputies and chieftains, and ascending to a <lb/>
window looking out on the crowded square, held up <lb/>
her baby-son in her arms.</p>

<p>Thus shouted the chieftains and the multitudes in <lb/>
the words of their ancient war-cry; and the hearts of <lb/>
the Hungarians were won for ever.</p>
<p>And now the fortune of battle changed. The <lb/>
Hungarian army quickly took the field, and swept <lb/>
their foes before them. The French were driven <lb/>
from Bohemia, Bavaria was ravaged and its Elector <lb/>
harried to an early grave, when Frederick, trembling <lb/>
for Silesia, advanced against Vienna with a huge <lb/>
army. But now the Austrians, with new courage, <lb/>
were on the alert. Forced to retreat and to suffer <lb/>
reverse after reverse, he only awaited a chance of <lb/>
recovering lost ground a little, to conclude a treaty <lb/>
with the Empress. With disgust and anger, Maria <lb/>
Th&eacute;r&egrave;se gave up Silesia to that "evil man," as she <lb/>
called Frederick, but only on condition that her <lb/>
husband should be recognised as Emperor.</p>
<p>Eight years of comparative calm ensued, which <lb/>
were by no means wasted by the energetic young <lb/>
Empress. Her great aim was to knit the disunited <lb/>
provinces of her vast empire together by weakening <lb/>
the power of their partly independent rulers, by <lb/>
trying to enforce the use of the German language <lb/>
everywhere, and by settling German officials in the <lb/>
various States. In this aim she succeeded so far <lb/>
that she was able at the end of eight years to raise <lb/>
a very fairly united army for the purpose of driving <lb/>
Frederick from Silesia&mdash;a purpose she had never for <lb/>
a moment lost sight of. With great tact and <lb/>
diplomacy she managed to get the European <lb/>
Powers on her side; England alone deserted Marie <lb/>
Th&eacute;r&egrave;se, her old ally, and joined forces with those of <lb/>
<pb n="106" entity="b000514724_0135"/>
Frederick. But Frederick was a born fighter, and <lb/>
he it was who actually began the Seven Years by <lb/>
invading and seizing Saxony.</p>
<p>A year of Prussian victory, however, was followed <lb/>
by a period of depression and defeat, in which the <lb/>
Empress seemed to have things all her own way. <lb/>
Then once again Frederick of Prussia got the upper <lb/>
hand; and so the see-saw of defeat and victory went <lb/>
on, until one by one the Allies fell away, and Austria <lb/>
and Prussia were left to fight it out alone. Neither, <lb/>
it seemed, would yield. But at length the news of <lb/>
the arrival of a great Turkish army to the aid of <lb/>
Prussia broke the proud spirit of the Empress, and <lb/>
for the sake of peace she gave Silesia into Frederick's <lb/>
hands.</p>
<p>Two years later, in 1765, the brave heart of <lb/>
Maria Th&eacute;r&egrave;se was almost broken by the sudden <lb/>
death of her husband, to whom she had always been <lb/>
most tenderly attached. He had never taken a <lb/>
conspicuous part in public matters, realising as he did <lb/>
that his wife both by birth and character was far <lb/>
more fitted to guide the affairs of state; but in <lb/>
other ways he had been everything to her. "I have <lb/>
lost in him," she writes, "the most affectionate <lb/>
friend, the most dearly beloved companion during a <lb/>
union of thirty years, and the joy of my life."</p>
<p>For the rest of her life she devoted herself to the <lb/>
interests of her fourteen children. To her daughter <lb/>
Marie Antoinette, married when a child of fifteen <lb/>
to Louis XVI. of France, she wrote regularly every <lb/>
three weeks, letters full of womanly tenderness, <lb/>
mingled with queenly dignity and high ideals. <lb/>
<pb n="107" entity="b000514724_0136"/>
The one difference which seems to have arisen <lb/>
between her and her son, who succeeded his father <lb/>
as the Emperor Joseph, was about the division of <lb/>
Poland between the various European countries. <lb/>
To her honour, be it said, the Empress strongly <lb/>
opposed it, and only after much difficulty was she <lb/>
overruled by her son and her most trusted Minister. <lb/>
But she signed the deed of partition under a written <lb/>
protest that is worth remembering:&mdash;</p>
<p>"When all my dominions were attacked, and I no <lb/>
longer knew where to go that my babe might be <lb/>
born in peace, I stood steadfast on my good right and <lb/>
the help of God. But in this transaction, when not <lb/>
only public right cries to Heaven against us, but <lb/>
also all fairness and common sense condemn us, I <lb/>
must confess that all the days of my life I have <lb/>
never before felt so troubled, and I am ashamed to <lb/>
show myself before the people. Let the Prince &lpar;the <lb/>
Emperor Joseph&rpar; consider what an example we give <lb/>
to the world, when for a miserable slice of Poland <lb/>
we throw our honour and reputation to the winds. <lb/>
I know well that I am alone, and no longer in <lb/>
health and strength; and therefore, though not <lb/>
without very great sorrow, I allow matters to take <lb/>
their course."</p>
<p>As the Empress grew older, she became even <lb/>
more popular with her people; for their many proofs <lb/>
of loyalty made her put aside that affectation of <lb/>
aloofness that she had at first assumed. The poor <lb/>
adored her, for she never went for a drive without <lb/>
filling her pockets with gold pieces, which she flung <lb/>
to them out of the carriage windows.</p>
<pb n="108" entity="b000514724_0137"/>
<p>On one occasion she delighted the hearts of noble <lb/>
and bourgeois alike by running from the Palace into <lb/>
the theatre close by, just in her ordinary dress; <lb/>
and leaning from the royal box, she gave them in <lb/>
the broad Vienna dialect the news of the birth <lb/>
of a grandson, which she had that moment <lb/>
received. "'Pold' &lpar;Leopold&rpar; has a boy," she cried, <lb/>
"and, just as a token of remembrance, on my <lb/>
wedding-day&mdash;is not he gallant?"</p>
<p>One can imagine the roar of applause with which <lb/>
this <hi rend="italic">na&iuml;ve</hi> recital was received.</p>
<p>Even in her old age, the Empress was a hard <lb/>
worker. She rose at six in winter, five in summer, <lb/>
and after attending an early mass, took a hasty <lb/>
breakfast, and worked at the petitions and reports <lb/>
brought to her on the previous day till nine o'clock. <lb/>
She then heard a second mass, spent some time <lb/>
with her younger children, and worked till one, <lb/>
when she ate her moderate dinner. Then came <lb/>
work again till six, when she attended vespers. <lb/>
Afterwards, till eight o'clock, she held her <reg orig="card-|parties">card-parties</reg>, <lb/>
to which her ladies were invited in order; <lb/>
then came a light supper of broth; and then she <lb/>
went to bed. In summer she loved to work in the <lb/>
open air, at a kind of improvised desk made of a <lb/>
tray slung round her neck by straps.</p>
<p>A bad carriage accident did much in these latter <lb/>
days to spoil the remains of her once remarkable <lb/>
beauty, but her energy of character, impetuous <lb/>
though kindly temper, and marvellous courage <lb/>
lasted even to her last moments. "You are all so <lb/>
timid," she said to her weeping attendants, as they <lb/>
<pb n="109" entity="b000514724_0138"/>
stood round her bed. "I am not afraid of death; I <lb/>
only ask God to give me strength to the end." <lb/>
Her last thanks were addressed to her Hungarian <lb/>
subjects, whose hearts she had won so many years <lb/>
ago; and then, with thoughts full of love and <reg orig="long-|ing">longing</reg> <lb/>
for the husband of her youth, she cried, "I am <lb/>
coming to thee!" and fell back dead into the arms <lb/>
of her son.</p>
<p>Forty years out of her sixty-four had been spent <lb/>
in incessant toil for her country's good. She had <lb/>
not always acted wisely, perhaps, especially in <reg orig="pro-|voking">provoking</reg> <lb/>
a long war which impoverished the land <lb/>
without attaining its end. But to Marie Th&eacute;r&egrave;se, <lb/>
Silesia, the "richest jewel of her crown," must <lb/>
not be lost without a blow; and if we blame her <lb/>
rashness, we cannot fail to honour her high ideal of <lb/>
responsibility and affection for all parts of her <lb/>
empire. It was much to the advantage of Europe, <lb/>
too, that she acted as a check on the rapidly <lb/>
increasing power of Frederick the Great. But most <lb/>
of all we honour Marie Th&eacute;r&egrave;se for the high example <lb/>
set by her, in a careless, evil-living age, of the work <lb/>
of an empress, a wife, and a mother.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Never</hi> perhaps has there smiled upon this <lb/>
earth such a gay and beautiful Princess as <lb/>
the little Marie Antoinette of Austria, and never <lb/>
certainly has there been reserved for a Queen of <lb/>
France such a tragic fate as hers.</p>
<p>During her short life of thirty-eight years she was <lb/>
to know few joys, save those that come from <lb/>
husband and child. Even her friendships were <lb/>
causes of suspicion and unrest. And during her <lb/>
last years she was to drink the cup of affliction to <lb/>
its very dregs&mdash;to know disappointment, distrust, <lb/>
unspeakable cruelty and scorn, the torture of seeing <lb/>
her dearest ones torn from her by brutal hands, and <lb/>
at length to die a lonely and disgraceful death.</p>
<p>Even the day of her birth, November 2, 1755, <lb/>
was overhung with clouds of horror. It was the <lb/>
day of the great Lisbon earthquake, when the whole <lb/>
of Europe was shaken with dismay and grief.</p>
<p>Yet the child herself was a most gay, merry little <lb/>
maid, full of high spirits, and so clever that with more <lb/>
<pb n="112" entity="b000514724_0143"/>
intelligent teaching than she received from the <reg orig="old-|fashioned">old-fashioned</reg> <lb/>
and ill-educated ladies appointed as the <lb/>
governesses of the royal children, she could never <lb/>
have incurred the jeers of the French Court for her <lb/>
ignorance of history and literature.</p>
<p>What she did know, she knew extremely well. <lb/>
She could read and speak Italian with the utmost <lb/>
fluency, and she overcame the other drawbacks to <lb/>
her education by her own determination, when she <lb/>
first came to the French Court. Yet she was a <lb/>
mere child in years when she made her appearance <lb/>
there. A schoolgirl of fifteen, very strictly brought <lb/>
up by a strong-willed mother such as Marie Th&eacute;r&egrave;se, <lb/>
is not often a model of learning, tact, and discretion, <lb/>
yet this was the age of the young Princess when she <lb/>
left her mother's side to become the bride of a shy, <lb/>
awkward, undeveloped lad, who cared much more for <lb/>
his model workshop than for his child-wife.</p>
<p>The change from the quiet, simple life of the <lb/>
Austrian palace to the mass of intrigue, etiquette, <lb/>
laxity, and open wickedness which surrounded the <lb/>
Court of Louis XV. must have been overwhelming. <lb/>
A stiff and stately dame, the Duchess de Noailles, <lb/>
was constantly at her elbow, checking and <reg orig="dis-|approving">disapproving</reg> <lb/>
at every turn, and it is not surprising <lb/>
to find the lively girl nicknaming her "Madame <lb/>
l'Etiquette" before many weeks were past.</p>
<p>The wearisome and interminable rules of behaviour <lb/>
which surrounded her were certainly enough to drive <lb/>
any girl to open revolt. To begin with, the very fact <lb/>
that the Princess was an Austrian caused the three <lb/>
old aunts of the Dauphin, the sisters of Louis XV., <lb/>
<pb n="113" entity="b000514724_0144"/>
to look upon her with much disfavour. They <lb/>
were horrified to hear that on one occasion, when <lb/>
hunting, the Princess insisted on placing in her <lb/>
carriage an old countryman, who had been wounded <lb/>
by the stag, and on driving him back to his own <lb/>
cottage. They were stricken dumb with shame to <lb/>
find the future Queen on her knees beside an aged <lb/>
attendant in her own room, carefully bathing the <lb/>
blood from a wound in his hand, made by moving <lb/>
a heavy piece of furniture at her request, and binding <lb/>
it up with her royal handkerchief. But her pretty, <lb/>
tactful ways soon won the hearts of the good ladies, <lb/>
and it was not from that quarter that a cloud of gossip <lb/>
and intrigue began to gather round Marie Antoinette.</p>
<p>The society of the King's two sisters was far more <lb/>
congenial to the girl, but her marked preference for <lb/>
the younger, the baby-child, Elizabeth, so offended <lb/>
their governess that she began to gather and <reg orig="circu-|late">circulate</reg> <lb/>
a mass of absurd and frivolous stories about <lb/>
the Dauphiness, which represented her girlish fun <lb/>
and harmless games with the younger ladies of her <lb/>
train as a criminal want of dignity. At length these <lb/>
reports reached the Austrian Court. Letters of <lb/>
sharp rebuke arrived at Paris from the Empress <lb/>
Marie Th&eacute;r&egrave;se. The girl replied with declarations of <lb/>
innocence, which seem at last to have convinced <lb/>
her royal mother; but still the need of repressing <lb/>
all her natural gaiety and liveliness was constantly <lb/>
impressed upon her.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the marriages of the Dauphin's two <lb/>
brothers, the Comte de Provence and the Comte <lb/>
d'Artois, at this period provided for the Princess <lb/>
<pb n="114" entity="b000514724_0145"/>
the society of two lively sisters-in-law of her own <lb/>
rank. They set etiquette aside so far as to sup <lb/>
together at the house of the Comtesse de Provence.</p>
<p>They acted plays, performed in fear and trembling <lb/>
lest their escapades should come to the ears of the <lb/>
old King or his sisters. The Dauphin was the only <lb/>
spectator, and he, unwilling and sullen at first, began <lb/>
to be amused at the comic parts, and hence to be upon <lb/>
more familiar terms with the young wife whom he at <lb/>
first had treated with schoolboy shyness.</p>
<p>In 1774, after four years of this odd kind of <lb/>
wedded existence, the old King, Louis XV., deserted <lb/>
by his terror-stricken followers, died of smallpox. <lb/>
The tramp and bustle of the courtiers, rushing from <lb/>
the dead man's ante-chamber to do homage to the <lb/>
new King and Queen, was the first thing that informed <lb/>
the latter of what had happened. Clasping their <lb/>
hands together, the young couple fell on their knees <lb/>
and cried with streaming eyes, "O God! guide us, <lb/>
protect us; we are too young to reign."</p>
<p>No one could weep long at the loss of the wicked <lb/>
old King, however, and the newly-made Queen <reg orig="especi-|ally">especially</reg> <lb/>
had soon recovered her spirits. Life looked <lb/>
bright indeed to her as she drove into Paris by her <lb/>
husband's side, surrounded by a running, shouting <lb/>
mass of people who never ceased to cry "Vive le <lb/>
Roi!" "Vive la Reine!" from sunrise to sunset. <lb/>
Ancient ladies of the Court hastened to pay their <lb/>
homage to the youthful sovereign, who stood for <lb/>
wearisome hours at their reception, and could not <lb/>
restrain a youthful giggle, barely concealed by her <lb/>
fan, when a young maid of honour of high rank, <lb/>
<pb n="115" entity="b000514724_0146"/>
whose place it was to stand behind her, seated <lb/>
herself on the floor, safely hidden by the hoops of <lb/>
the Queen and her ladies, and played mischievous <lb/>
tricks, twitching their dresses and making flippant <lb/>
remarks.</p>
<p>But a Queen might not even smile without offence. <lb/>
The old ladies went away, declaring that the young <lb/>
sovereign had "mocked" them openly, and that <lb/>
not one of them would attend her Court again.</p>
<p>This innocent bit of fun was the beginning of a <lb/>
prejudice which quickly took root in Paris against <lb/>
the "Austrian," and though often apparently arrested, <lb/>
was secretly growing with terrible force and strength. <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"Little Queen, you must not be</l>
<l>So saucy with your twenty years;</l>
<l>Your ill-used courtiers soon will see</l>
<l>You pass, once more, the barriers."</l>
</lg></q>
So sang an ill-natured jester in the Paris streets, <lb/>
and in the veiled threat which the lines contain we <lb/>
seem to hear a far-off echo of the terrible "Song of <lb/>
Revolution."</p>
<p>Meantime the Queen submitted herself with a <lb/>
fairly good grace outwardly, though with many a <lb/>
private shrug and <hi rend="italic">moue</hi>. She certainly had a good <lb/>
deal to undergo. The rules of etiquette, even in <lb/>
such a simple matter as dressing in the morning, <lb/>
were so elaborate that no lady-in-waiting might <lb/>
hand the Queen a garment if another of higher rank <lb/>
happened to appear on the scene, and thus the <lb/>
victim of courtly manners was often obliged to stand <lb/>
shivering in the lightest attire, while her clothing was <lb/>
<pb n="116" entity="b000514724_0147"/>
passed with bows and courtesies from one dame to <lb/>
another.</p>
<p>Every day the royal pair were expected to dine in <lb/>
public before the curious eyes and personal remarks <lb/>
of any casual passer-by of decent appearance who <lb/>
chose to enter the dining-room. Marie Antoinette <lb/>
hated this ancient custom, as well as the practice of <lb/>
being served by kneeling ladies of the highest rank. <lb/>
But her practice of avoiding it whenever possible gave <lb/>
deep offence to the Parisians.</p>
<p>Yet the same young Queen who was accused of <lb/>
levity when she was merely in high spirits, and of <lb/>
disregarding the ancient <hi rend="italic">r&eacute;gime</hi> when she only longed <lb/>
for simplicity, held so high a standard in the midst of <lb/>
a Court but lately famous for its wickedness, that she <lb/>
would not allow a play to be acted which she thought <lb/>
in any way unsuitable for the young girls of her suite <lb/>
to witness, besides keeping the strictest watch in other <lb/>
ways over their morals and conduct.</p>
<p>The artificiality of the Court life became at times <lb/>
unspeakably wearisome to both Louis XVI. and Marie <lb/>
Antoinette. The Parisians were outwardly very <lb/>
loyally disposed. Won by her youth, beauty, and <lb/>
charming manners, they greeted the Queen when <lb/>
she attended the Opera House with loud applause. <lb/>
But there was always a sense of discomfort and <reg orig="dis-|content">discontent</reg> <lb/>
in the air, more especially as there seemed no <lb/>
chance of an heir to the French throne. Much to <lb/>
the Queen's delight, therefore, the King gave her the <lb/>
Ch&acirc;teau of Petit Trianon, a country house surrounded <lb/>
by beautiful gardens, where Marie Antoinette and her <lb/>
ladies dressed as milkmaids and tried to make butter, <lb/>
<pb n="117" entity="b000514724_0148"/>
and Louis XVI. toiled as a locksmith in his workshop, <lb/>
and reluctantly consented to wash his grimy hands <lb/>
before sitting down to table.</p>
<p>Here the Queen seemed happy enough, though in <lb/>
her heart was that deep longing for children of her <lb/>
own which nothing else could satisfy. She even <lb/>
adopted a blue-eyed peasant child who became <lb/>
entangled one day among the legs of her horses. <lb/>
"Petit Jacques" became the darling of the Queen's <lb/>
apartments, only to develop in later years into one <lb/>
of the most bloodthirsty assassins of the Reign of <lb/>
Terror.</p>
<p>Meantime it was but natural to a young, lively, and <lb/>
high-spirited girl of twenty-one that she should get <lb/>
what amusement was possible out of her narrow life, <lb/>
hedged in as it was by custom and etiquette. Love <lb/>
of pleasure led her into indiscretions, harmless enough, <lb/>
but to be used against her in later years with deadly <lb/>
force.</p>
<p>She adored dancing, and determined to attend the <lb/>
opera balls of Paris with a single lady of her suite, <lb/>
both carefully disguised in dominoes and masks. <lb/>
The King's brothers generally joined her party on <lb/>
arrival, but Louis himself cared little for such <lb/>
festivities, and preferred to go to bed. Naturally <lb/>
outspoken and careless of consequences, the young <lb/>
Queen readily betrayed her identity.</p>
<p>On one occasion, when her carriage had broken <lb/>
down and she had been obliged to proceed in a cab, <lb/>
she exclaimed, "That <hi rend="italic">I</hi> should have been in a <hi rend="italic">fiacre</hi>! <lb/>
Is it not droll?" in a voice that all bystanders could <lb/>
hear. The gossip spread itself rapidly through Paris, <lb/>
<pb n="118" entity="b000514724_0149"/>
and the Queen's mysterious peregrinations, disguised <lb/>
and in an ordinary conveyance, became, with the <lb/>
wildest exaggeration, the topic of conversation <reg orig="every-|where">everywhere</reg>.</p>
<p>No one who really knew her upright character <lb/>
would have listened for a moment to this unkind talk, <lb/>
but unfortunately it was impossible to come into close <lb/>
touch with any of the people themselves, and they <lb/>
never understood either her or her husband. "We <lb/>
always loved the people" were the Queen's touching <lb/>
words during the last months of horror and disgrace, <lb/>
and both King and Queen showed their kindly feeling <lb/>
in a thousand different ways towards those with whom <lb/>
they in any way came into contact. It was about this <lb/>
time that a certain unused room in the King's <reg orig="apart-|ments">apartments</reg> <lb/>
at Versailles was repaired and decorated at an <lb/>
expense of 30,000 francs, without the knowledge of <lb/>
Louis. When he discovered the cost, he was full <lb/>
of anger and distress. "With that sum I could <lb/>
have made thirty families happy," he said.</p>
<p>It was their misfortune that previous centuries <lb/>
of misgovernment and tyrannical treatment had <lb/>
so completely impressed themselves on the minds <lb/>
of the people that they never attempted to realise <lb/>
that in the persons of this awkward, loutish King <lb/>
and his beautiful young Queen the ancient <hi rend="italic">r&eacute;gime</hi> <lb/>
had already passed away, and that they would <lb/>
have been the first to welcome any radical changes <lb/>
that would have reduced the Court expenditure <lb/>
and broken down the bars of etiquette which <lb/>
had been erected between themselves and their <lb/>
subjects.</p>
<pb n="119" entity="b000514724_0150"/>
<p>Yet it seemed as though each fresh attempt <lb/>
towards simplicity of living only drew new suspicion <lb/>
upon the Court. During the broiling summer of 1778 <lb/>
the Queen, shut up all day in the close Palace rooms, <lb/>
would come out at night to walk with the Princesses <lb/>
and her brothers-in-law on the terrace under her <reg orig="apart-|ments">apartments</reg>. <lb/>
The royal musicians provided music, and <lb/>
gradually outsiders from the Park pressed so near <lb/>
as almost to mingle with the royal party.</p>
<p>Nothing could have been more innocent than <lb/>
these nightly garden parties. But they soon <reg orig="be-|came">became</reg> <lb/>
the ground for accusations of indiscretion and <lb/>
undignified behaviour, which the Queen treated with <lb/>
contempt, but which lost nothing when repeated <lb/>
in the lowest slums of Paris.</p>
<p>In the December of that year the Queen's greatest <lb/>
longing was fulfilled. A child was born to her&mdash; <lb/>
not the hoped-for heir, but a daughter, Marie <lb/>
Th&eacute;r&egrave;se, always known as "Madame Royale." A son <lb/>
came to her two years later, however, to the <lb/>
unbounded joy of the simple-hearted Louis XVI. <lb/>
"You have fulfilled my wishes and those of France," <lb/>
he said to his wife with a voice choked with emotion. <lb/>
"You are the mother of a Dauphin."</p>
<p>The people seemed beside themselves with <lb/>
delight. All the tradesmen of Paris assembled <lb/>
at Versailles according to their orders. The <reg orig="shoe-|makers">shoemakers</reg> <lb/>
finished off a little pair of boots for the <lb/>
Prince, the tailors displayed a tiny uniform, the <lb/>
masons built him a model palace. Alas for the <lb/>
omen! The grave-diggers were there too, with <lb/>
pick and spade, in a conspicuous position.</p>
<pb n="120" entity="b000514724_0151"/>
<p>Four years later her second son was born, and <lb/>
the good sense of the Queen became apparent <lb/>
very early in her plans for the education of her <lb/>
children. Brought up herself in awe and fear of <lb/>
her mother, she determined to make her little ones <lb/>
love her and to have them with her as much as <lb/>
possible. But that they might never forget the <lb/>
responsibilities of their royal position, she talked <lb/>
to them constantly of the sufferings of the poor, <lb/>
and during one very hard winter taught them <lb/>
to know the pleasure of giving up new toys that <lb/>
the starving babes of Paris might be warmed and <lb/>
fed.</p>
<p>Yet at the very time when the Queen was doing <lb/>
all she could to please the nobility and to help her <lb/>
people, a detestable plot was being formed against <lb/>
her. The affair of the "diamond necklace" is <lb/>
surrounded with mystery, but one thing is clear. <lb/>
It was a plot contrived by some of the courtiers, <lb/>
with a Cardinal of the Roman Church at their <lb/>
head, to convince the people that Marie Antoinette <lb/>
had obtained a diamond necklace of extravagant <lb/>
value without paying the jeweller in whose possession <lb/>
it had been.</p>
<p>The affair was discovered and the ringleaders <lb/>
punished, but with such mercy that the public <lb/>
probably never knew that the Queen was cleared <lb/>
beyond all doubt. Clouds of suspicion began to <lb/>
gather round the royal palace. The Cardinal's <lb/>
party never rested till they had spread abroad their <lb/>
tale of scandal and innuendo. The Queen was <lb/>
accused of unduly influencing the King against those <lb/>
<pb n="121" entity="b000514724_0152"/>
whom she disliked, and especially against the <lb/>
Cardinal. Passing through her rooms one day, <lb/>
Marie Antoinette heard a servant say, "A Queen <lb/>
who does her duty will remain in her apartment and <lb/>
knit." She laughed sadly, saying within herself, <lb/>
"Poor wretch, thou art right; but thou knowest not <lb/>
my situation: I yield to necessity and my evil <lb/>
destiny."</p>
<p>That evil destiny was pressing hard upon her&mdash; <lb/>
harder than she knew.</p>
<p>In 1789 the "States-General," the French <reg orig="Parlia-|ment">Parliament</reg> <lb/>
which had not sat for a hundred and seventy <lb/>
years, met together. The King and Queen went <lb/>
down to the opening ceremony; it was the last time <lb/>
that the Queen appeared in public in her royal robes. <lb/>
Threatening words were heard from the <hi rend="italic">poissardes</hi>, <lb/>
the fishwives of Paris, as Marie Antoinette drove <lb/>
past. The first mutter of the storm was making <lb/>
itself heard.</p>
<p>The feeling of the Assembly was strongly against <lb/>
royalty from the first. Influenced by Mirabeau, a <lb/>
deputation arrived at the Palace at Versailles <reg orig="pre-|pared">prepared</reg> <lb/>
to detect the King in a chronic condition of <lb/>
gluttony and drunkenness and the Queen living in <lb/>
such unbridled luxury as bade fair to drain the <lb/>
treasury of the State. They were particularly <lb/>
anxious to see Petit Trianon, and, amazed at the <lb/>
extreme modesty of the little house, insisted that <lb/>
certain rooms studded with diamonds, sapphires, and <lb/>
rubies, were concealed from them.</p>
<p>From the day of the opening of the <reg orig="States-|General">States-General</reg> <lb/>
the Queen's troubles began. The Dauphin, <lb/>
<pb n="122" entity="b000514724_0153"/>
a languid and melancholy child, who seemed weighed <lb/>
down by the burden of the sins of his ancestors, <lb/>
died; and the sole hope of succession lay in his <lb/>
brother Louis, at that time a bright, engaging boy <lb/>
of five years old.</p>
<p>Then the movements of insurrection began. In <lb/>
vain the King tried to arouse the loyalty of the people <lb/>
by attending the meeting of the States-General in <lb/>
his private capacity, announcing to them, "I trust <lb/>
myself to you; I only wish to be at one with my <lb/>
nation, and counting on the affection and fidelity of <lb/>
my subjects, I have given orders to the troops to <lb/>
remove from Paris and Versailles." Even if they <lb/>
were induced by these words to give him some <lb/>
measure of confidence, they never for a moment put <lb/>
aside their senseless prejudice against the Queen.</p>
<p>A rough crowd filled the courtyards of the Palace <lb/>
and greeted the appearance of Marie Antoinette and <lb/>
the Dauphin upon the balcony with groans and jeers. <lb/>
"Tell your Queen not to meddle with government <lb/>
any longer," said a woman, fiercely snatching at the <lb/>
arm of one of the ladies-in-waiting who had mingled <lb/>
with them in the courtyard. "Let her leave her good <lb/>
husband and our good States-General to effect the <lb/>
happiness of the people." But we have no space <lb/>
here to tell the whole terrible story of the Revolution, <lb/>
and must pass over those scenes in which Marie <lb/>
Antoinette herself was not intimately concerned.</p>
<p>In October 1789, the King and Queen, who could <lb/>
not have realised the imminent danger in which they <lb/>
stood, gave a great entertainment at Versailles to a <lb/>
regiment of foreign soldiers, whom they were accused <lb/>
<pb n="123" entity="b000514724_0154"/>
of summoning as a safeguard against their own <lb/>
subjects.</p>
<p>This event, and the scarcity of bread in Paris, <lb/>
kindled the fury of the fishwives and other women <lb/>
of the city, and they led the way to Versailles, <lb/>
followed by a huge rabble of men and boys.</p>
<p>The Queen was the especial object of this attack. <lb/>
About half-past four in the morning, as the Queen <lb/>
lay asleep in bed, a noise of mingled shots and yells <lb/>
was heard outside the Palace. A maid of honour <lb/>
flew to the Queen's bedside, another opened the door <lb/>
of the ante-chamber leading into the great <reg orig="guard-|room">guardroom</reg>, <lb/>
and saw one of the body-guard holding his <lb/>
musket across the farther door and endeavouring to <lb/>
keep out the infuriated mob. Turning his face, <lb/>
streaming with blood, towards her, he cried, "Save <lb/>
the Queen, madame; they are come to assassinate <lb/>
her."</p>
<p>Hastily bolting the inner door, she rushed to the <lb/>
bedchamber, crying, "Get up, madame; don't stay <lb/>
to dress; fly to the King's apartments." The <lb/>
Queen, whose one thought was for her husband and <lb/>
children, flew to his room; but he meantime had <lb/>
gone to her apartments by another passage, and for <lb/>
a moment the shock of his absence almost overcame <lb/>
her. The sight of the little Dauphin and "Madame <lb/>
Royale" reassured her, however, and a message was <lb/>
quickly brought that the King was also safe.</p>
<p>Meantime the yells outside had become so <reg orig="ap-|palling">appalling</reg> <lb/>
that something had to be done to prevent a <lb/>
general massacre of the guards. The Queen, <reg orig="there-|fore">therefore</reg>, <lb/>
went bravely on to the balcony overlooking the <lb/>
<pb n="124" entity="b000514724_0155"/>
courtyard, holding her two children by the hand. <lb/>
"No children!" shrieked the women below. The <lb/>
King then joined his wife, who expected every <lb/>
moment to receive her deathblow.</p>
<p>"To Paris!" yelled the mob.</p>
<p>With quiet dignity, Louis motioned with his hand, <lb/>
and in a momentary silence said, "You wish, my <lb/>
children, that I should follow you to Paris. I <reg orig="con-|sent">consent</reg>, <lb/>
but only on condition that I shall not be <lb/>
separated from my wife and children."</p>
<p>The royal carriage was at once made ready, and <lb/>
the strange procession set forth, amid the yells of the <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">poissardes</hi> who surrounded them. "We shall no <lb/>
longer want bread&mdash;we have the baker, the baker's <lb/>
wife, and the baker's boy with us!"</p>
<p>In front of the carriage were borne in cruel <lb/>
mockery the heads of two of the murdered <reg orig="body-|guard">bodyguard</reg>, <lb/>
set up on poles.</p>
<p>So Versailles, and the happy days at Petit <lb/>
Trianon, passed away for ever.</p>
<p>One consolation remained to the Queen. Her <lb/>
husband and children were still with her, and after <lb/>
this terrifying experience they scarcely left her side. <lb/>
The day after they arrived at Paris, the little Louis, <lb/>
hearing a sudden noise in the garden, rushed to his <lb/>
mother's arms, exclaiming, "Oh, mamma, will it be <lb/>
yesterday over again?" Then laying his hand on <lb/>
his father's knee, he asked with sad precocity, <lb/>
"Papa, what have you done to make the people so <lb/>
angry with you?"</p>
<p>The King's reply is perhaps the best explanation <lb/>
of his position that history has given us. Taking <lb/>
<pb n="125" entity="b000514724_0156"/>
the boy upon his knees, he said, "I wished, my child, <lb/>
to make the people happier than they were; and I <lb/>
also wanted money to pay the expenses occasioned <lb/>
by wars; for it is not right that a king, any more <lb/>
than a private man, should not pay his debts. I <lb/>
asked my people for money, as my predecessors <lb/>
have always done; the magistrates composing the <lb/>
Parliament opposed it, and said that my people <lb/>
alone had a right to consent to it. I called together <lb/>
the principal inhabitants of every town in the <reg orig="States-|General">States-General</reg>. <lb/>
But when they were assembled they <lb/>
required concessions which I could not make with <lb/>
due respect for myself or with justice to you, my <lb/>
successor; so wicked men induced the people to rise <lb/>
against us; but the people must not be blamed."</p>
<p>It soon became perfectly clear that Paris was no <lb/>
place of safety for the royal family, and that their <lb/>
only chance of freedom, indeed of life, lay in flight <lb/>
from France. Preparations were made with the <lb/>
utmost care. The Comte de Fersen, a most loyal <lb/>
friend, ordered a travelling - carriage in the name <lb/>
of a German lady of his acquaintance, procured <reg orig="pass-|ports">passports</reg>, <lb/>
and on the appointed night, disguised as a <lb/>
coachman, he himself drove the royal family part of <lb/>
the way to the Belgian frontier. But fortune was <lb/>
against them in every direction. About twelve <lb/>
miles from Paris the carriage broke down, and much <lb/>
time was spent in its repair. The King insisted on <lb/>
walking up two of the hills, and thus altogether <lb/>
they were delayed about three hours after the time <lb/>
appointed for meeting the detachment of guards <lb/>
which was to escort them from Varennes.</p>
<pb n="126" entity="b000514724_0157"/>
<p>The officer in charge of the latter, seeing that <lb/>
the presence of his troops was causing much <lb/>
suspicion among the countrypeople, thought it best <lb/>
to make them leave the highway and proceed to <lb/>
Varennes by two cross-roads, and thus missed the <lb/>
travelling - coach altogether. Meantime Louis, in <lb/>
passing through a village just before the highroad <lb/>
to Varennes was reached, looked out of the window <lb/>
and asked several questions concerning the road. <lb/>
The postmaster, struck with his likeness to the <lb/>
picture of the King's head upon bank-notes, came <lb/>
up to the window, recognised the Queen, and <lb/>
slipping away, mounted a horse and rode off to <lb/>
Varennes to inform the Mayor that the royal family <lb/>
were in the act of making their escape.</p>
<p>These mysterious movements and the absence of <lb/>
the troops who were to have conducted them into <lb/>
the town, filled the King and Queen with alarm, <lb/>
which was increased by the words of an unknown <lb/>
horseman, who galloped past the window of the <lb/>
carriage, crying out, "You are recognised!"</p>
<p>They reached Varennes to find the town guard <lb/>
up in arms against them, whilst their own regiment <lb/>
was in confusion, newly arrived, and quite uncertain <lb/>
how to act. Their captain rode up to the King and <lb/>
asked if he should effect a passage by force; but <lb/>
Louis, always undecided, and dreading an order that <lb/>
should cause blood to be shed, refused.</p>
<p>The royal family were then hurried to the shop <lb/>
of the grocer-mayor, where the Queen, sitting <lb/>
among the soap and candles, tried every argument <lb/>
in her power to induce his stout wife to persuade <lb/>
<pb n="127" entity="b000514724_0158"/>
her husband to help them to escape. But she <lb/>
would say nothing except "Good heavens, madame, <lb/>
it would be the destruction of M. Sauce: I love my <lb/>
King, but I love my husband too, you must know, <lb/>
and he would be answerable, you see." Then Marie <lb/>
Antoinette did all she could to delay their return <lb/>
to Paris, in the hope that another regiment might <lb/>
arrive to aid them. It was of no use. They were <lb/>
hurried back to the carriage, where the King was <lb/>
assailed with such jeers and reproaches that the poor <lb/>
Queen, disappointed, weary, and cut to the heart by <lb/>
such humiliations, raised her veil and said to them, <lb/>
"Well, since you recognise your sovereign, respect <lb/>
him."</p>
<p>The wretched return journey was made in the <lb/>
company of two violent demagogues, one of whom <lb/>
was converted to decent conduct by the sad dignity <lb/>
of his fellow-travellers; but the other ate and drank <lb/>
in their presence, and narrowly missed throwing his <lb/>
chicken-bones into the King's face. Then dragging <lb/>
the little Dauphin on to his knees, he began twisting <lb/>
his long fair hair in his dirty fingers with such <lb/>
roughness that the child cried.</p>
<p>This was too much for the poor mother, who <lb/>
snatched her son away with angry words that spoke <lb/>
only too plainly of nerves strained to <reg orig="breaking-|point">breaking-point</reg>.</p>
<p>In such wise was the royal party conducted back <lb/>
to the Tuileries, where they found themselves <lb/>
prisoners and closely guarded. The doors of the <lb/>
rooms occupied by the King and Queen stood open <lb/>
by day and night, and the ante-chamber between <lb/>
<pb n="128" entity="b000514724_0159"/>
them was always occupied by an officer who was <lb/>
nothing better than a spy. No wonder that the <lb/>
shock and strain of the failure of their hopes, joined <lb/>
to its immediate consequences, resulted in the <lb/>
change of the Queen's beautiful hair to snowy <lb/>
white. <hi rend="italic">"Blanched by Sorrow"</hi> was the <reg orig="inscrip-|tion">inscription</reg> <lb/>
she sent with a lock of it to the Princesse de <lb/>
Lamballe, her dearest friend, who was destined to <lb/>
die before her.</p>
<p>The next few months saw scene after scene of <lb/>
indignity and insult. The King standing <reg orig="bare-|headed">bareheaded</reg> <lb/>
like a culprit before his judges, was forced <lb/>
to accept the new Constitution of the State. <lb/>
Scarcely any of their old suite were allowed to <lb/>
attend upon the royal family. Poison was <lb/>
suspected in the food prepared by a furious <lb/>
Jacobin cook, and all kinds of precautions had to <lb/>
be used by the few faithful servants left to them to <lb/>
ensure their safety in this respect.</p>
<p>The King began at this crisis to lose his nerve <lb/>
altogether. For ten days he never spoke, and <lb/>
seemed as though he were becoming physically <lb/>
and mentally helpless. It was only the Queen's <lb/>
love and energy that could succeed in rousing him <lb/>
from this fatal condition by representing to him <lb/>
that if they were doomed to fall they must at least <lb/>
fall with honour and dignity.</p>
<p>On the terrible 20th of June 1792 a crisis <lb/>
came. The King had refused to give his consent <lb/>
to the banishment of priests from France, and a <lb/>
mob of desperadoes forthwith rushed upon the <lb/>
Palace.</p>
<pb n="129" entity="b000514724_0160"/>
<p>Benches placed hastily before a window recess in <lb/>
which the King stood saved him from immediate <lb/>
assassination; and some of the ruffians forced <lb/>
their way to the council - chamber where Marie <lb/>
Antoinette, outwardly calm, faced what she thought <lb/>
was certain death, with a few of her women by her <lb/>
side, and the Dauphin seated on the table before <lb/>
her. For her child's sake, she had pinned a <reg orig="tri-|coloured">tri-coloured</reg> <lb/>
cockade in her hair, and had placed the <lb/>
hateful <hi rend="italic">bonnet rouge</hi> of the democrats upon her <lb/>
boy's head. They shrieked imprecations at her as <lb/>
they pushed past the table, showing her a gibbet <lb/>
from which hung a dirty doll, with the inscription&mdash;</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">"Marie Antoinette &agrave; la lanterne!"</hi></p>
<p>One woman in particular assailed her in the most <lb/>
violent terms. The Queen asked her if she had <lb/>
ever seen her before. She replied, "No." "Have I <lb/>
done you any personal wrong?" she asked again. <lb/>
"No," said the woman, "but it is you who have <lb/>
caused the misery of the nation."</p>
<p>"You have been told so," answered the Queen. <lb/>
"You are deceived. As the wife of the King of <lb/>
France and mother of the Dauphin, I am a <lb/>
Frenchwoman. I shall never see my own country <lb/>
again: I can be happy or unhappy only in France. <lb/>
I was happy when you loved me."</p>
<p>The tears rolled down the woman's dirt-stained <lb/>
face.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">"It was because I did not know you,"</hi> she said; <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">"I see that you are good."</hi></p>
<p>Want of knowledge&mdash;constant misapprehension&mdash; <lb/>
those were the actual causes of the fury of the mob <lb/>
<pb n="130" entity="b000514724_0161"/>
against their Queen. To them she was not Marie <lb/>
Antoinette, but the emblem of all the tyranny, <lb/>
cruelty, and misgovernment that had turned the fair <lb/>
land of France during a whole century into a <lb/>
country of madmen, thirsting for their rulers' blood.</p>
<p>So the terrible months passed on, until the <lb/>
Queen openly longed for any change, however <lb/>
violent, that would end their misery. Never <lb/>
alone, spied upon by day and night, subjected <lb/>
to frequent visits of insult from the revolutionary <lb/>
leaders and to the cruel mockery of the <lb/>
mob outside, and assailed more than once by <lb/>
secret assassins, the long days of misery dragged <lb/>
on.</p>
<p>At length the 10th of August arrived. The <lb/>
Palace, surrounded by the faithful Swiss Guard, <lb/>
was attacked by the furious Marseillais, who <lb/>
were parading the city with their terrible song and <lb/>
assassinating all those who were known to be <lb/>
friends of the King. An order came from the <lb/>
Assembly bidding the royal family to give <lb/>
themselves up to it for safety.</p>
<p>And thus the palace of the Tuileries was left <lb/>
for the last time. Amidst the bloodshed and <lb/>
massacre of that awful day, the King, Queen, <lb/>
and the royal children were hurried into four <lb/>
little cells of a monastery near by, called Les <lb/>
Feuillans, and from thence to more secure and yet <lb/>
more sordid lodgings at the Temple. In the <lb/>
small tower of this latter building the King and <lb/>
Queen, the Dauphin, the little Madame Royale, <lb/>
and Madame Elizabeth, the King's sister, were <lb/>
<pb n="131" entity="b000514724_0162"/>
imprisoned, with only one male attendant, from <lb/>
the 13th of August 1792.</p>
<p>It is from the pen of the young Princess, then <lb/>
a child of twelve, that we get a vivid picture of <lb/>
those last sad days. "My father taught my <lb/>
brother geography; my mother history and to <lb/>
learn verses by heart; and my aunt gave him <lb/>
lessons in arithmetic. My father fortunately found <lb/>
a library that amused him, and my mother <lb/>
worked tapestry. &hellip; We went every day to <lb/>
walk in the garden for the sake of my brother's <lb/>
health, though the King was always insulted by <lb/>
the guard. Our gaoler &hellip; would sing the <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Carmagnole</hi> and a thousand other horrors before <lb/>
us; &hellip; knowing that my mother disliked the <lb/>
smell of tobacco, he would puff it in her face, as <lb/>
well as in that of my father, as they happened <lb/>
to pass him. He took care always to be in bed <lb/>
before we went to supper, because he knew that <lb/>
we must pass through his room. My father <lb/>
suffered it all with gentleness, forgiving the man <lb/>
from the bottom of his heart. My mother bore <lb/>
it with a dignity that frequently repressed his <lb/>
insolence."</p>
<p>On September 3rd horrid shouts were heard <lb/>
outside the door and window. "My father," <lb/>
says Madame Royale, "asked what was the <lb/>
matter, and as several of the guard had now <lb/>
arrived, one of their number replied, 'Well, since <lb/>
you will know, it is the head of Madame de <lb/>
Lamballe that they want to show you.'"</p>
<p>At these words the Queen was overcome <lb/>
<pb n="132" entity="b000514724_0163"/>
with horror; for the beautiful Princesse de <lb/>
Lamballe had been her dearest friend. It was <lb/>
with much difficulty that the brutal mob was <lb/>
restrained from breaking into the room with their <lb/>
dreadful trophy on the end of a pike. A terrible <lb/>
night followed.</p>
<p>"My aunt and I heard the drums beating to arms <lb/>
all the while," writes the Princess. "My unhappy <lb/>
mother did not even attempt to sleep. We heard <lb/>
her sobs."</p>
<p>So the days of the September Massacres passed <lb/>
away, and, clinging to one another for company, the <lb/>
sad little family resumed their regular habits, and <lb/>
tried pathetically to rouse themselves to play at <lb/>
games of ball and ninepins for the sake of keeping <lb/>
up the spirits of the little Prince.</p>
<p>But in the beginning of October, after the <reg orig="de-|position">deposition</reg> <lb/>
of the King, they were treated with increased <lb/>
severity, and at length Louis was separated from his <lb/>
wife and family except at meal-times, and then only <lb/>
allowed to see them on condition they talked "loud, <lb/>
and in good French." It was the beginning of the <lb/>
end, and for the first time the brave heart of the <lb/>
Queen began to fail. The trial of the King took <lb/>
place early in December, and during that time he <lb/>
was not allowed to see his wife at all. She entreated <lb/>
that at least his children might visit him; but this <lb/>
was only permitted on condition that they were <lb/>
entirely separated from their mother, and to this <lb/>
the King unselfishly refused to agree.</p>
<p>At length the mockery of a trial came to an end, <lb/>
and Louis XVI. was condemned to die. That last <lb/>
<pb n="133" entity="b000514724_0164"/>
meeting with wife, sister, and children is too sacred <lb/>
to describe. It was only possible to end it by <lb/>
promising that he would see them again in the <lb/>
morning before he set out to the place of execution. <lb/>
But when day broke, this loving husband and father <lb/>
would not again rack those tender hearts by a last <lb/>
farewell; and Marie Antoinette never saw her <lb/>
husband again in this world.</p>
<p>It seemed as though her cup of sorrow was full, <lb/>
but there were still some bitter drops to fall. The <lb/>
little Dauphin became ill with fever, and for a long <lb/>
time his mother was forced to see him suffering by <lb/>
night and day without being able to obtain either <lb/>
medicine or advice for him. Even when he <reg orig="re-|covered">recovered</reg>, <lb/>
he was never the same again. His sister <lb/>
says: "Want of air and exercise did him great <lb/>
mischief, as well as the kind of life which this <lb/>
poor child led, who at eight years old passed his <lb/>
days amidst the tears of his friends, and in constant <lb/>
anxiety and agony."</p>
<p>But worse was to come. In July a decree ordered <lb/>
that the Dauphin should be separated from his <lb/>
family and placed in the most secure apartment of <lb/>
the Tower. Then the cup of agony flowed over, <lb/>
and the poor mother, to whom the child clung with <lb/>
shrieks and sobs, defended him by force against <lb/>
those who would have torn him from her. Only <lb/>
the threat of the soldiers that they would kill him <lb/>
and his sister before her eyes was of any avail. <lb/>
Heartbroken, she unfastened his clinging hands and <lb/>
handed the poor little fellow to the officers, who <lb/>
promised to use him kindly.</p>
<pb n="134" entity="b000514724_0165"/>
<p>What was her horror when she heard that the <lb/>
delicate child was delivered over to one Simon, an <lb/>
infamous shoemaker, to be brought up as a <hi rend="italic">citoyen.</hi> <lb/>
Death itself would have been better; but merciful <lb/>
death was not to come to him then. From that <lb/>
time the brave and loving heart was broken with <lb/>
grief. <hi rend="italic">"Nothing can hurt me now,"</hi> were the last <lb/>
words her daughter heard her say, as she struck her <lb/>
head accidentally against the low wicket, when the <lb/>
officers hurried her from the Temple to her last <lb/>
resting-place in the Conciergerie, the lowest prison <lb/>
of Paris.</p>
<p>From thence, after her disgraceful trial, she was <lb/>
led on the 16th of October to the spot where her <lb/>
husband had perished ten months before. The <lb/>
Republican David's terrible picture paints her dressed <lb/>
in citizen garb, her beautiful hair cut off, her figure <lb/>
shapeless and bowed. But that picture, painted as <lb/>
an insult and a scoff, shows her in reality as a <lb/>
martyr&mdash;a martyr to the ancient <hi rend="italic">r&eacute;gime,</hi> a victim of <lb/>
the sins of the old nobility of France. Her dignity <lb/>
and inborn courtesy never deserted her. "Pardon <lb/>
me," she said, bowing to the executioner, upon whose <lb/>
feet she had accidentally trodden.</p>
<p>"She ascended the scaffold with a firm and <lb/>
dignified step, as if she had been about to take her <lb/>
place on a throne by the side of her husband," says <lb/>
one witness; and another writes: "She knelt for an <lb/>
instant, and uttered a half-audible prayer; then <lb/>
rising and glancing towards the towers of the <lb/>
Temple, "'Adieu once again, my children,' she <lb/>
said; 'I go to rejoin your father.'""</p>
<pb n="135" entity="b000514724_0166"/>
<p>So perished in the flower of her age the most <lb/>
beautiful and the most unfortunate Queen of France. <lb/>
Her poor little son, after two years and a half of <lb/>
misery and neglect that were worse than death, was <lb/>
the last royal victim of the Revolution. Her <lb/>
daughter lived to marry her cousin, the Duc <lb/>
d'Angoul&ecirc;me, but never to forget those years of <lb/>
horror and bloodshed amidst which she had passed <lb/>
her youth.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> life-stories of Marie Antoinette, Queen of <lb/>
France, and of Manon Roland, daughter of <lb/>
the people and most ardent of Revolutionists, so <reg orig="un-|like">unlike</reg> <lb/>
in most things, so absolutely opposed politically, <lb/>
become curiously intermingled from time to time, <lb/>
and in the end are merged into the same common <lb/>

&mdash;yet we cannot help thinking that if the <reg orig="warm-|hearted">warmhearted</reg>, <lb/>

perfectly natural conditions, and "talked things over," <lb/>
as we say, both would have learnt much that was <lb/>
profitable, and have come to value the really noble <lb/>
points in each other's character.</p>
<p>But such things could not be in the Paris of the <lb/>
Revolution.</p>
<p>Marie-Jeanne, or "Manon," Phlipon, was born in <lb/>
Paris a year after the birth of Princess Marie <lb/>
Antoinette. Her father was an engraver, a man of <lb/>
violent temper, who seems never to have understood <lb/>

his high-spirited, clever child, though he was proud <lb/>
enough of her fine intellect and beautiful features.</p>
<p>One of the scenes which the woman of forty, <lb/>
waiting for death in her wretched cell, remembered <lb/>
most clearly was an early contest of will between <lb/>
her father and herself.</p>
<p>She was six years old, and sitting up in bed, <lb/>
feverish and sick from some childish illness, when <lb/>
the gentle, sad-faced mother whom she adored, <lb/>
brought her a nauseous dose of medicine.</p>
<p>The sight and smell sickened the child, but she <lb/>
tried, valiantly though ineffectually, to swallow it. <lb/>
Her mother encouraged her to try again, but as she <lb/>
did so, <hi rend="italic">p&egrave;re</hi> Phlipon hurried in, decided at once that <lb/>
obstinacy alone was the cause of her difficulty, and <lb/>
administered a sharp whipping. Manon instantly <lb/>
hardened herself, and declared amidst sobs and tears <lb/>
that she would try no more to swallow it. This <lb/>
brought a second chastisement, upon which the <lb/>
child, screaming with pain and anger, tried to upset <lb/>
the glass. Her father, completely out of temper, <lb/>
snatched up the cane for a third punishment; upon <lb/>
which she conquered her sobs, dried her tears, and <lb/>
prepared to receive the blows with Spartan fortitude. <lb/>
"They might have killed me on the spot," she says, <lb/>
in her prison memoirs, "without my uttering so <lb/>
much as a sigh; nor will it cost me more to-day to <lb/>
ascend the guillotine than it did then to yield to a <lb/>
barbarous treatment which might have killed but <lb/>
not conquered me."</p>
<p>From that time M. Phlipon wisely left the proud <lb/>
and sensitive child to the care of the mother whom <lb/>
<pb n="139" entity="b000514724_0172"/>
Manon idolised. But both her parents seem to <lb/>
have realised with what an exceptional brain their <lb/>
little daughter was gifted, for she was given masters <lb/>
and opportunities for study such as were extremely <lb/>
rare for a girl in her position.</p>
<p>At seven years of age, however, the only books <lb/>
she could obtain were the Missal, the Bible, and the <lb/>
Psalter, to the study of which she turned for refuge <lb/>
during the somewhat terrible hours of the Sunday <lb/>
visits paid to her grandmother. This poor old lady <lb/>
had softening of the brain, but Manon could not <lb/>
understand this, and took it very ill that when she <lb/>
danced and skipped about the room "Grand'm&egrave;re" <lb/>
always burst into tears, whilst if she grazed her <lb/>
knee or bruised her hand with a fall the old woman <lb/>
gave a hoarse chuckle of delight.</p>
<p>Fortunately for her, Madame Phlipon, besides <lb/>
giving her teachers in singing, dancing, music, and <lb/>
Latin, soon granted her leave to read any book <lb/>
she found in the house. Terrified lest the <reg orig="per-|mission">permission</reg> <lb/>
should be withdrawn, the child would slip <lb/>
from her bed at five in the morning, creep to <lb/>
her mother's room, from whence she was forbidden <lb/>
to remove the precious volumes, and there sit lost <lb/>
in a world of her own until roused to a sense of <lb/>
everyday affairs by the moving household. <reg orig="Un-|fortunately">Unfortunately</reg>, <lb/>
the little store was quickly exhausted; <lb/>
but the sharp-eyed Manon soon discovered that <lb/>
one of her father's apprentices used to keep a <lb/>
number of volumes hidden away in a cupboard <lb/>
of the workshop.</p>
<p>This workshop was next the big <hi rend="italic">salon</hi>, a nook <lb/>
<pb n="140" entity="b000514724_0173"/>
of which, boarded off, was Manon's bedroom and <lb/>
study. From this retreat she would dart out, like <lb/>
a spider on a fly, directly the workroom was empty <lb/>
for a moment, snatch one of the little hoard of <lb/>
books, and fly back to the window-seat of her tiny <lb/>
room, to revel in stories of travel or adventure <lb/>
for hours at a time. Luckily, this bookish apprentice <lb/>
had not only a good taste in literature, but also <lb/>
a warm sympathy with the little student; for he <lb/>
kept her supplied in this way with standard books <lb/>
as far as his slender means would allow, and so <lb/>
was the means of introducing her to the work which <lb/>
became a landmark in her life. When she was <lb/>
barely nine years old she first opened a volume <lb/>
of Plutarch, translated probably by Amyot. This <lb/>
book, with its series of noble lives, its vivid <lb/>
pictures of Greece and Rome, not only opened a <lb/>
new world to the little maiden; it made her a <lb/>
Republican.</p>
<p>Everywhere she went she carried the volume <lb/>
of Plutarch with her; it was her Bible, her Missal, <lb/>
for she could not part with it even in church; <lb/>
and her one great though secret lamentation was <lb/>
that she had not been born a native of Sparta or <lb/>
of Rome.</p>
<p>She never lost the deep impression made by <lb/>
this book upon her childish mind, though she <lb/>
was soon to pass through another and very different <lb/>
phase. Her mother, a woman of quiet and deep <lb/>
religious convictions, probably saw that so tender <lb/>
and impulsive a nature would not fail to be keenly <lb/>
affected by religious experiences. Her confirmation, <lb/>
<pb n="141" entity="b000514724_0174"/>
at the age of eleven, stirred her to the depths. She <lb/>
read nothing but the Lives of the Saints, and wept <lb/>
because she had no chance of witnessing to the <lb/>
faith of Christ at the stake or at the lion's mouth.</p>
<p>A sense of her own unworthiness overwhelmed <lb/>
her, and when the time for her first Communion <lb/>
approached she could bear it no longer. Coming <lb/>
one evening into her parents' presence, she fell <lb/>
sobbing at their feet in a torrent of tears. "I am <lb/>
going to beg of you," she said, when she could speak <lb/>
for crying, "to do something which grieves me sadly, <lb/>
but which my conscience bids me to do. Send <lb/>
me to a convent." Her mother soothed and <lb/>
comforted her, questioning her as to the reason <lb/>
for her strange request. The child could only <lb/>
say that she felt the need of preparing for her <lb/>
first Communion in the strictest seclusion.</p>
<p>Perhaps the temptation to lose herself at home in <lb/>
the delights of Plutarch was strong upon her; or <reg orig="per-|haps">perhaps</reg> <lb/>
the Sunday walks, when she was decked out in <lb/>
bright silk frocks, with crimped hair and frizzled <lb/>
locks, bore heavily upon the strained little soul. <reg orig="Any-|how">Anyhow</reg>, <lb/>
her wish to bury herself for a while in religious <lb/>
seclusion away from the world was so sincere that <lb/>
her parents agreed, and she was presently placed <lb/>
as boarder in the Convent of the Congregation, <lb/>
a building which stood next the prison in which she <lb/>
was afterwards to be confined.</p>
<p>This year, passed within the high walls which <lb/>
enclosed a peaceful garden, full of great trees and <lb/>
winding paths, was perhaps the happiest of Manon's <lb/>
life. She tasted to the full the religious rapture <lb/>
<pb n="142" entity="b000514724_0175"/>
of prayer and meditation and devotion; the organ <lb/>
notes, the chanting of the anthem by the thin, sweet <lb/>
voices of the nuns, to her were unmixed joy. At <lb/>
first she seems to have longed to become a nun <lb/>
herself, but presently a new arrival turned her <lb/>
girlish mind into more natural channels. This was <lb/>
another young boarder, from Amiens this time, <lb/>
named Sophie Cannet, whose tear-stained face as <lb/>
she sat, homesick and miserable, at the <reg orig="supper-|table">supper-table</reg>, <lb/>
filled Manon's warm little heart with pity <lb/>
and affection.</p>
<p>The two girls became inseparable. They walked, <lb/>
read, worked together, and vowed an eternal friendship, <lb/>
destined to outlive most childish fancies, lasting <lb/>
as it did, to the very gate of death. Another and <lb/>
more one-sided attachment was also begun here. <lb/>
A poor little lay-sister, Agatha, forced to take the <lb/>
veil at seventeen because she had no dowry, and <lb/>
to perform the most menial offices of the convent, <lb/>
fell in love with the little <hi rend="italic">d&eacute;vote</hi>, petted her in every <lb/>
way possible, pouring out on the bright-faced child <lb/>
all the wealth of stifled affection. Through all <lb/>
the long years of absence she never forgot her <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">mignonne</hi>, but in the dark days before them both, <lb/>
put aside her own cares to comfort her "daughter" <lb/>
in the hour of death and desolation.</p>
<p>After a year at the convent, Manon Phlipon <lb/>
was sent for another year to the care of her father's <lb/>
mother, a jovial, merry little woman, who taught <lb/>
her granddaughter fine needlework and the "art of <lb/>
sentimentality," salted with a somewhat roguish <lb/>
wit. But Manon's devotion to her mother made <lb/>
<pb n="143" entity="b000514724_0176"/>
her rejoice when at the age of thirteen she was <lb/>
recalled to her tiny study-bedroom and to the noise <lb/>
and bustle of her father's house.</p>
<p>From this time we have a wonderfully vivid <lb/>
picture of her home-life painted for us in her <lb/>
weekly letters to her friend Sophie. These show <lb/>
us also a mind of unusual strength and depth, <lb/>
pondering on the problems of life even in those <lb/>
girlish days. One great truth, at any rate, she <lb/>
managed to hit upon, and for the rest of her life <lb/>
she tried to live up to it. "Let us endeavour <lb/>
to know ourselves," she writes; "let us not be <lb/>
that factitious thing that can only exist by the <lb/>
help of others. <hi rend="italic">Let us be ourselves."</hi></p>
<p>Meantime, while cultivating self-knowledge, she <lb/>
did not hesitate to avail herself of the stored-up <lb/>
wisdom of the ancients. She read everything she <lb/>
could get hold of&mdash;Greek and Latin classics, <lb/>
French philosophers&mdash;and with her untired mind <lb/>
keen to devour anything new that came in her <lb/>
way, copied out a whole treatise on geometry <lb/>
because she could not obtain it otherwise for her <lb/>
own study.</p>
<p>But she was no untidy "blue-stocking," no <lb/>
dreamy mystic. Healthy and well developed, she <lb/>
was at the age of twenty a very fine-looking <lb/>
girl. Her hair was soft, dark and thick, her <lb/>
eyes deep blue, her complexion brilliant, but <lb/>
changing quickly with every passing emotion. <lb/>
She had her share of girlish vanity, too, and was <lb/>
wont to sigh occasionally over a mouth too large <lb/>
and a nose too thick at the tip for strict beauty. <lb/>
<pb n="144" entity="b000514724_0177"/>
She loved enjoyment and pleasure of all kinds; <lb/>
but underneath all this was a deep and thoughtful <lb/>
nature, readily impressed by the grave problems <lb/>
of society.</p>
<p>Two events stand out from these quiet days <lb/>
and affect the future Revolutionist with a <reg orig="never-|to-be-forgotten">never-to-be-forgotten</reg> <lb/>
emotion. One day she heard the <lb/>
tramp of the crowd, thirsty for blood, which <lb/>
hurried to watch the dying sufferings of two <lb/>
youths tortured by the wheel and at the stake <lb/>
for the murder of their father. The shrieks of <lb/>
the criminals, the ferocity of the crowd, were <lb/>
stamped upon Manon's very soul. Her heart <lb/>
throbbed with pity no less for the cruel onlookers, <lb/>
watching their prey with tigerish delight, than <lb/>
for the sufferers themselves.</p>
<p>From that time the condition of the people <lb/>
occupied her thoughts more and more, and in <lb/>
violent contrast to their miserable poverty she could <lb/>
place the state and magnificence of their rulers. <lb/>
For in her twentieth year she stayed for a week <lb/>
with her mother in the palace of Versailles, lodging <lb/>
in the attics by the invitation of a friend who was <lb/>
one of the royal servants.</p>
<p>There she must often have seen the young Queen <lb/>
in the Palace gardens; and the sight seems to have <lb/>
roused much bitterness against poor Marie Antoinette, <lb/>
all unconscious in her innocent gaiety of the opinion <lb/>
of her strenuous namesake. "Take me away," says <lb/>
Marie Phlipon to her mother, "or I shall detest <lb/>
these people so heartily that I shall not know what <lb/>
to do with my hatred."</p>
<pb n="145" entity="b000514724_0178"/>
<p>So she returned once more to her home, to brood <lb/>
over the wasteful excess of the palace and the <reg orig="grind-|ing">grinding</reg> <lb/>
poverty of the cottage. But not for long was <lb/>
she left undisturbed. Her mother died with terrible <lb/>
suddenness, and Manon was bereft of her best friend <lb/>
and protector. Her father, who only cared for her <lb/>
as far as she ministered to his vanity and selfishness, <lb/>
began to neglect both home and daughter.</p>
<p>He was flattered and pleased by the number of <lb/>
distinguished and literary men whom the brilliant <lb/>
conversation and witty tongue of his child attracted <lb/>
to his house; but when he found that Manon was <lb/>
by no means inclined to marry the first fine <reg orig="gentle-|man">gentleman</reg> <lb/>
who asked her, he grew restive, neglected his <lb/>
business affairs, and began to spend his own and his <lb/>
daughter's patrimony at the gaming-table.</p>
<p>In vain she tried to win him back by her careful <lb/>
housekeeping and tender affection: he grew more <lb/>
and more violent in temper, and once even bade her <lb/>
leave his house for ever if she could not find a <lb/>
husband for herself.</p>
<p>Now Manon had not come to the age of <reg orig="twenty-|five">twenty-five</reg> <lb/>
without having had several offers of marriage; <lb/>
but she had a very high ideal of married life, and <lb/>
from this she refused to be moved by her father's <lb/>
scoldings and teasings on the subject. The only <lb/>
suitor upon whom she looked with favour was a tall, <lb/>
thin, cadaverous gentleman from Amiens, who had <lb/>
one day called with an introduction from a mutual <lb/>
friend, and after several visits had kept up a <lb/>
correspondence with her when he set out on his <lb/>
travels.</p>
<pb n="146" entity="b000514724_0179"/>
<p>This was M. Roland, whose formal request for her <lb/>
hand was met with such a contemptuous refusal <lb/>
from Manon's inconsistent father that the girl was <lb/>
forced to come to an abrupt decision.</p>
<p>She saw that it was hopeless to win her father <lb/>
back to home and work, that it was more probable <lb/>
that he would attend to the latter if she were not <lb/>
in the house to superintend matters, and that, in the <lb/>
state of poverty which he was surely bringing upon <lb/>
them, she had better fit herself for an independent <lb/>
livelihood if M. Roland did not at once claim her for <lb/>
his own.</p>
<p>So, without an open quarrel, she left her father's <lb/>
house and went to live in an attic in the convent <lb/>
where she had spent her happiest year of childhood. <lb/>
It was all very different now. The old days of <lb/>
religious enthusiasm would never return again. <lb/>
Home troubles and intellectual difficulties had <lb/>
turned Manon far from the pleasant paths of former <lb/>
days, and all she could do now was to wait in <lb/>
proud patience and dismal poverty for a cautious <lb/>
and dilatory lover, who took six months to make <lb/>
up his mind after he heard she had left her father's <lb/>
house.</p>
<p>This long delay killed the spring of love in <lb/>
Manon, but when M. Roland at length appeared <lb/>
upon the scene, and seeing her looking more <lb/>
beautiful than ever behind the convent grating, <lb/>
asked her to be his wife, she decided that admiration <lb/>
and respect were, after all, a good foundation for <lb/>
marriage, and so agreed. They were a very <reg orig="ill-|assorted">ill-assorted</reg> <lb/>
pair,&mdash;he, austere and precise; she, full of <lb/>
<pb n="147" entity="b000514724_0180"/>
enthusiasm and emotion,&mdash;but she married him that <lb/>
she might add to the happiness of an honourable <lb/>
man, and she nobly fulfilled her resolve.</p>
<p>Her first few years of married life were calm <lb/>
enough. They lived at Amiens, where she renewed <lb/>
her friendship with Sophie and her sister Henriette. <lb/>
Here her only child, Eudora, was born in 1781, <lb/>
and grew to be a reserved, cold-natured little <lb/>
person, on whom her mother lavished a wealth of <lb/>
affection which was scarcely reciprocated. A visit <lb/>
to England only served to intensify her sense of <lb/>
rebellion against the slavery and misery of her own <lb/>
countrymen.</p>
<p>But most of her time was spent in a little country <lb/>
village among the vineyards, where her husband's <lb/>
ancestral home was situated, and where studies of <lb/>
all kinds were laid aside for the ordinary humdrum <lb/>
duties of wife and mother.</p>
<p>Gradually, however, there penetrated to this quiet <lb/>
spot the sound of the muttering thunder which <reg orig="pre-|ceded">preceded</reg> <lb/>
the great storm of the French Revolution. <lb/>
The Assembly of the States - General, the <reg orig="repre-|sentatives">representatives</reg> <lb/>
of the people, which had not met for more <lb/>
than a hundred and fifty years, the fall of the <lb/>
Bastille, that emblem of tyranny, the Declaration <lb/>
of the Rights of Man, which declared all men to <lb/>
be "citizens" on equal terms without distinctions of <lb/>
rank&mdash;all these things were received by Madame <lb/>
Roland with intense enthusiasm. "Who is the <lb/>
traitor," she writes at this time, "who at this <lb/>
moment minds any business but that of the <lb/>
nation!"</p>
<pb n="148" entity="b000514724_0181"/>
<p>Then came the riot at Versailles and the forced <lb/>
return of the royal family to the Tuileries; and in <lb/>
1790 that curious outburst of national revival which <lb/>
showed itself like a gleam of sunshine before a <lb/>
storm.</p>
<p>The Rolands were in Lyons now, whither <lb/>
M. Roland had been appointed to an important <reg orig="posi-|tion">position</reg> <lb/>
on the municipal body which was attempting to <lb/>
reform the condition of the people of that town.</p>
<p>To the delight of his wife, he had no sooner <lb/>
made himself thoroughly acquainted with the <reg orig="con-|ditions">conditions</reg> <lb/>
of the silk manufacture for which Lyons was <lb/>
famous than he was summoned to Paris to represent <lb/>
to the National Assembly the necessity of aid for <lb/>
the city.</p>
<p>From that moment Madame Roland plays an <lb/>
important part in the drama of the Revolution. No <lb/>
sooner was she settled in apartments with husband <lb/>
and child than a large number of political notables <lb/>
gathered round her. Her powers of thought, her clear <lb/>
sight, her vigorous speech, made her a valuable <lb/>
partisan, while her freedom from mere party instincts, <lb/>
her love of the people, and her high moral tone made <lb/>
her the ideal of the purer Revolutionary spirit.</p>
<p>The attempted flight of the royal family brought <lb/>
matters to a climax in the June of 1791; and Madame <lb/>
Roland was one of the first to declare that this was <lb/>
the opportunity for the deposition of the King and <lb/>
the formation of a Republic. This had always been <lb/>
her ideal, and it was to her now the only means of <lb/>
averting bloodshed.</p>
<p>She was present at the meeting of the Jacobin <lb/>
<pb n="149" entity="b000514724_0182"/>
Club in the church of what had been a Jacobin <lb/>
monastery, when all the leading members, <reg orig="kneel-|ing">kneeling</reg> <lb/>
on the ground with drawn swords, swore to live <lb/>
free or die; and describing it afterwards she says: <lb/>
"At last I have seen the fire of liberty lit in my <lb/>
country; it cannot be quenched again. &hellip; I shall <lb/>
end my days when it pleases nature. My last <lb/>
breath will still be a sigh of joy and hope for the <lb/>
generations to succeed us."</p>
<p>But alas for her high hopes! The sunshine of <lb/>
"liberty, equality, fraternity," was soon to be <lb/>
quenched in blood.</p>
<p>The outcome of this meeting of the Jacobin Club <lb/>
was a monster petition for the deposition of the <lb/>
King, but the assembly of the people for this purpose <lb/>
in the Champs de Mars was the first occasion of a <lb/>
purposeless massacre of some hundreds of men, <lb/>
women, and children by the cannon of the National <lb/>
Guards, instigated it is supposed by the party which <lb/>
still upheld the Constitution&mdash;that is, who wished the <lb/>
King to rule, but under the Assembly.</p>
<p>For a time the Jacobin Club was in danger of <lb/>
collapse, and Robespierre, its leading spirit, was <lb/>
forced to hide himself.</p>
<p>And just then, his mission having been fulfilled, <lb/>
M. Roland returned to his country house with the <lb/>
wife whose heart remained behind in seething, <lb/>
passionate Paris.</p>
<p>Meantime the days of the National Assembly <lb/>
came to an end, and a new Assembly was called, <lb/>
conspicuous in which were a little band of ardent <lb/>
men from the Gironde, the "idealists of the <reg orig="Revolu-|tion">Revolution</reg>"; <lb/>
<pb n="150" entity="b000514724_0183"/>
full of zeal for a free Republic, but <reg orig="deter-|mined">determined</reg> <lb/>
to achieve it by worthy means and to keep <lb/>
clear of violence or bloodshed. When the Rolands <lb/>
returned to Paris in the December of that year, it <lb/>
was with these high-minded men of the "Gironde" <lb/>
party that Madame Roland at once threw in her <lb/>
lot.</p>
<p>Early in 1792 M. Roland entered the new <lb/>
Ministry, and from that time his wife became the <lb/>
leading spirit of his party. Her wonderful insight <lb/>
into character and strong grasp of principles made <lb/>
her a most valuable helper; and had she been <lb/>
perfectly free to act on her own responsibility, there <lb/>
is little doubt that she would so have inspired the <lb/>
faction with that unity, determination, and clear <lb/>
purpose for lack of which it fell. But she was <lb/>
obliged to speak through the lips of her husband, <lb/>
and his want of tact and rigidity in dealing with <lb/>
details when principles were at stake, made him a <lb/>
most difficult person to influence.</p>
<p>M. Roland had by this time been appointed as <lb/>
Minister of the Interior, a most important post; but <lb/>
his wife, though now mistress of a magnificent <lb/>
Ministerial residence, made no difference in the <lb/>
simplicity of her life, keeping only a small room for <lb/>
her private use, and meeting her husband's colleagues <lb/>
twice a week at a Ministerial dinner at which she <lb/>
was the only woman present, though her little <lb/>
girl was usually at her side.</p>
<p>Meantime the difficulty of getting the unfortunate <lb/>
Louis XVI. to adopt any definite line of conduct with <lb/>
regard to the new Republic was pressing hard. <lb/>
<pb n="151" entity="b000514724_0184"/>
Madame Roland herself wrote to him on one <reg orig="occa-|sion">occasion</reg>, <lb/>
imploring him to trust the nation, and not on <lb/>
any account to involve it in foreign war by calling <lb/>
in an invading force. The effect of this letter, sent <lb/>
in M. Roland's name, was to bring about the <reg orig="dis-|missal">dismissal</reg> <lb/>
of the Ministers by the Court party in the <lb/>
Assembly, and thus to make the Girondists the most <lb/>
popular people in Paris. But the mischief was <lb/>
done.</p>
<p>The rumour of an approaching army of foreigners <lb/>
roused the whole of France. Two hundred <reg orig="Marseil-|lais">Marseillais</reg>, <lb/>
singing the Hymn of the Revolution, marched <lb/>
to the aid of Paris through the length and breadth <lb/>
of France, calling the people to arms. The <reg orig="unfor-|tunate">unfortunate</reg> <lb/>
King, Queen, and the royal children were <lb/>
imprisoned in the Temple, the Swiss Guard was <lb/>
massacred, and within a few hours the leadership <lb/>
passed from the hands of the Assembly to those of <lb/>
Danton and the "Commune."</p>
<p>Between this man and Madame Roland there <lb/>
existed a violent antipathy. "I never," she says, <lb/>
"beheld so repulsive and atrocious a countenance. <lb/>
&hellip; I could not reconcile that face with a <reg orig="well-|meaning">well-meaning</reg> <lb/>
man."</p>
<p>Marat, too, had emerged from his lurking-place to <lb/>
take his seat in this unconstitutional Assembly&mdash; <lb/>
Marat, who revelled in bloodshed and openly sang <lb/>
the praises of murder. Little indeed had such men <lb/>
in common with the enthusiastic idealism of Marie <lb/>
Roland or the uprightness of her husband.</p>
<p>The nearness of the Austrian army, however, <lb/>
reconciled the people to any measures of violence; <lb/>
<pb n="152" entity="b000514724_0185"/>
and during the long hot August days crowds of <lb/>
nobles, priests, or suspected citizens were arrested. <lb/>
The prisons were crowded.</p>
<p>On the 2nd of September all Paris was full of <lb/>
unrest and excitement. The air was thick with <lb/>
sinister rumours, the bells rang muffled peals, volleys <lb/>
of cannon thundered in the distance&mdash;what did it <lb/>
all mean?</p>
<p>No one knew how it began or who was the <lb/>
instigator, but just as a party of priests was being <lb/>
transferred to the Abbaye, the most crowded of the <lb/>
prisons, the fury of the crowd by whom they were <lb/>
surrounded seemed to explode into a wild thirst for <lb/>
blood. The prison doors were opened. Prisoners <lb/>
were haled forth and done to death by the pikes <lb/>
of the multitude as they reached the outer air. For <lb/>
three days and nights Paris went mad, like a tiger <lb/>
who has tasted blood, and the streets were literally <lb/>
choked with the bodies of the slain. Those who <lb/>
stood aside from these horrors cried in vain, "Why <lb/>
does not the Commune stop it?" It was only too <lb/>
clear that the Commune, under Marat and Danton, <lb/>
were the instigators of the whole affair.</p>
<p>But the multitude was not content to stay its <lb/>
rage with the bodies of prisoners only. Those who <lb/>
were suspected of sympathy with the murdered or <lb/>
disapproval of these desperate measures must also be <lb/>
thrown to the wild beasts. On Sunday, September <lb/>
2nd, when she was at home alone, a crowd of <lb/>
yelling men surrounded the Ministerial residence, <lb/>
calling upon the Minister to furnish them with <lb/>
arms. The trembling servants assured them that <lb/>
<pb n="153" entity="b000514724_0186"/>
M. Roland was not within; but as they refused <lb/>
to depart, Madame Roland sent for ten of them to <lb/>
speak to her in person.</p>
<p>They rushed in, ragged and wild of aspect, <lb/>
only to be somewhat daunted by the calm <reg orig="self-|possession">self-possession</reg> <lb/>
of the brave wife. When they again <lb/>
demanded arms, she bade them go to the Minister <lb/>
of War; her husband had no arms to give. They <lb/>
had been there already, they said, and muttered <lb/>
darkly, "These Ministers are traitors."</p>
<p>"Take your complaints to the Commune," said <lb/>
Madame Roland, with perfect coolness; "but if you <lb/>
want my husband you will find him doing his duty <lb/>
at a Cabinet meeting."</p>
<p>They departed; but Madame Roland, watching <lb/>
them from a balcony, saw one of their number, <lb/>
mad with rage, with his shirt-sleeves rolled up, <lb/>
brandishing a sword and cursing the Ministers as <lb/>
traitors.</p>
<p>Curiously enough, at this critical moment the <lb/>
Rolands owed their escape to the very man whom <lb/>
Marie so hated and despised. Danton discovered <lb/>
that an order of arrest was out against the Minister, <lb/>
and getting possession of it before it was executed, <lb/>
went to the Mayor of Paris, saying, "See here! <lb/>
That committee of <hi rend="italic">enrag&eacute;s</hi> has made out an order <lb/>
of arrest against Roland. We cannot allow this! <lb/>
A member of the Council, too!"</p>
<p>The Mayor took the order, read it, and returned <lb/>
it, saying, "Let it be. It will produce a good <lb/>
effect." "Produce a good effect!" said Danton, <lb/>
looking hard at the Mayor. "No; I cannot allow it."</p>
<pb n="154" entity="b000514724_0187"/>
<p>But the Rolands well understood the peril they <lb/>
were in.</p>
<p>"We are under the knife of Robespierre and <lb/>
Marat," she said to a friend at this time; and <lb/>
terror of the consequences no doubt helps to account <lb/>
for the way in which M. Roland at first kept <lb/>
quietly out of the way, making no protest against <lb/>
proceedings which his party considered infamous.</p>
<p>He was most anxious to send in his resignation, <lb/>
but his wife kept him firm to his post. "For my <lb/>
husband to quit the Administration at such a <lb/>
juncture would prove a public calamity," she said. <lb/>
"But as for my enthusiasm for the Revolution, I <lb/>
am ashamed of it! Scoundrels have defiled it! <lb/>
It is become hideous; but we cannot leave Paris."</p>
<p>From the opening of the Republic in September <lb/>
1792 under the leadership of Danton, Marat, and <lb/>
Robespierre, the Girondists did not cease to protest <lb/>
against rule by massacre and violence. M. Roland, <lb/>
urged by his wife, even ventured to address a <reg orig="re-|monstrance">remonstrance</reg> <lb/>
to the Assembly, which was printed and <lb/>
widely published. The position of the Gironde <lb/>
grew more and more critical. The only way for <lb/>
its members to recover the power which was fast <lb/>
slipping from their hands was to join forces with <lb/>
Danton, who had already made proposals to that <lb/>
effect.</p>
<p>Strange as it may seem to those who share <lb/>
Madame Roland's antipathy and look upon Danton <lb/>
as a criminal maniac, it would have been the only <lb/>
course of wisdom. For Danton, brutal and violent <lb/>
though he might be, yet was perfectly sincere in <lb/>
<pb n="155" entity="b000514724_0188"/>
acting solely for what he believed was the good of <lb/>
the nation, without a shadow of personal greed or <lb/>
ambition; and had he been held in check by the <lb/>
lofty ideals of the Girondists, the Republic might <lb/>
have been saved.</p>
<p>But Madame Roland's pure and humane character <lb/>
revolted utterly against joining hands with this man; <lb/>
and her influence stirred the whole party against <lb/>
him. Compromise seemed unnecessary, too; for the <lb/>
Girondists had the majority in the Convention, and <lb/>
were strong enough to demand the persecution of <lb/>
the instigators of the September Massacres. This <lb/>
brought them face to face with Danton, Marat, and <lb/>
Robespierre, and a deadly conflict began. But the <lb/>
feelings of the mob were with the three Revolutionary <lb/>
leaders, and Robespierre's terribly clever speech of <lb/>
defence resulted in their complete victory.</p>
<p>The fall of the Girondists was now only a matter <lb/>
of weeks. Once only did there seem some chance <lb/>
of reconciliation, and that was when the victorious <lb/>
General Dumouriez returned to Paris and both <lb/>
parties united to welcome him.</p>
<p>The Rolands gave a dinner in his honour, at <lb/>
which Madame presided in her gayest and most <lb/>
brilliant mood, wearing a "Republican gown," whose <lb/>
white folds fell from neck to heel, and her thick <lb/>
dark hair knotted loosely together and flowing <lb/>
to her waist in the fashion of a Roman matron. <lb/>
It was the last ray of light before the black night <lb/>
of terror which was to see these gay and laughing <lb/>
guests and hostess scattered in secret hiding-places <lb/>
or waiting in lonely patience for the hour of death.</p>
<pb n="156" entity="b000514724_0189"/>
<p>In the events that followed hard upon one another <lb/>
Madame Roland takes a very prominent place. It <lb/>
was probably rather admiration than spite that made <lb/>
her <hi rend="italic">b&ecirc;te noir</hi> Danton exclaim, "Why not invite <lb/>
Madame Roland to the Ministry too? Everyone <lb/>
knows that Roland is not alone in office." But <lb/>
the envenomed eyes of Marat and his friends were <lb/>
upon her with no friendly gaze, and they only <lb/>
awaited an opportunity to strike. This soon came, <lb/>
through a characteristic but very imprudent act of <lb/>
her own. The trial of Louis XVI. was approaching, <lb/>
and his enemies were on the lookout for any scrap <lb/>
of evidence against him, when a locksmith, who had <lb/>
been employed by the King, brought information to <lb/>
the Rolands of the existence of an iron chest in the <lb/>
Tuileries, containing important State papers.</p>
<p>Immediately she heard of them, Madame Roland <lb/>
hurried to the Palace, emptied the contents of the <lb/>
chest into a napkin and brought them to her <lb/>
husband, who looked them through, docketed and <lb/>
affixed his seal to each bundle, and then handed <lb/>
them over to the Convention. Their object was to <lb/>
prevent false evidence being inserted among these <lb/>
papers, but it was a most unwise step as regarded <lb/>
themselves. For though the papers were full of <lb/>
matters which seriously compromised the King, the <lb/>
attempt at even temporary suppression was enough <lb/>
in those days to stamp the Rolands as traitors to <lb/>
the cause.</p>
<p>But they had still many friends on their side, <lb/>
and when Roland had been called to the <reg orig="Conven-|tion">Convention</reg> <lb/>
and had answered satisfactorily the charges <lb/>
<pb n="157" entity="b000514724_0190"/>
brought against him, he was discharged. Then <lb/>
Madame Roland was called, and spoke so bravely, <lb/>
clearly, and wisely as to her intention in the matter <lb/>
that she was acquitted amid thunders of applause. <lb/>
For the moment Marat was foiled, but he could, as <lb/>
he thought, afford to wait.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Girondists were forced to look on <lb/>
helplessly while Louis XVI., whom at worst they <lb/>
would have banished from his country, was led out <lb/>
to die on the scaffold. Their murmurs of dissent <lb/>
and disapproval were met with threats of <reg orig="assassina-|tion">assassination</reg>. <lb/>
The leaders of the party were forced to seek <lb/>
refuge in the houses of friends. Madame Roland <lb/>
herself was persuaded to leave her official home <lb/>
disguised as a peasant woman, but at the last <lb/>
minute she threw aside her cap and cloak, <reg orig="ex-|claiming">exclaiming</reg>, <lb/>
"I am ashamed at the part you wish <lb/>
me to play; I will neither disguise myself nor <lb/>
go hence. If they want to assassinate me, let it <lb/>
be at my own house."</p>
<p>On the day after the execution of the King, <lb/>
Roland had resigned his post as Minister, and his <lb/>
resignation was received in ominous silence. His <lb/>
wife's anxieties were increased by his failing health <lb/>
and by the difficulty of providing for the safety of <lb/>
her child Eudora, now a solemn, fair-haired girl <lb/>
of thirteen. It was dangerous to keep her in <lb/>
Paris, where at any moment they might be arrested, <lb/>
but still more dangerous to send her away from her <lb/>
only protectors to unreliable strangers.</p>
<p>While she, full of uneasiness, was still in <reg orig="retire-|ment">retirement</reg> <lb/>
in the Rue de la Harpe, the battle between <lb/>
<pb n="158" entity="b000514724_0191"/>
the Girondists and the party of Marat was raging <lb/>
in the Convention, and bade fair to set all France <lb/>
in a blaze of civil war.</p>
<p>Marat for a time had lost ground; but a leader <lb/>
of the Girondists seeing that only human sacrifice <lb/>
would heal the widening breach between Paris and <lb/>
the provinces, who held by the Gironde, had nobly <lb/>
cried, "Citizens, do not hesitate between a few men <lb/>
and the Commonwealth. Fling us into the abyss, <lb/>
and let the country be saved!" Deaf to the <lb/>
nobility of the offer, the Revolutionary Tribunal <lb/>
triumphantly recalled Marat to power, who, looking <lb/>
towards that part of the Hall where sat the doomed <lb/>
band of the Girondists, was heard to mutter, "I have <lb/>
them now. They too shall have a triumphant <lb/>
progress, but it shall be to the guillotine."</p>
<p>On the 31st of May, after a week's illness, <lb/>
Madame Roland was awakened from a troubled <lb/>
sleep at half-past five in the evening by a loud <lb/>
knocking at the door. It was a company of armed <lb/>
men, sent by the Revolutionary Committee to arrest <lb/>
Citizen Roland. The old man, weak and shaken <lb/>
with ill-health, refused to go with them, saying that <lb/>
he did not recognise the authority of the Committee, <lb/>
and they forthwith returned to the council-chamber <lb/>
of the Commune.</p>
<p>This action roused all the latent fire in Madame <lb/>
Roland. Without consulting anyone, she threw on <lb/>
a shawl and drove to the Assembly, determined <lb/>
to speak her mind and to rouse the Convention <lb/>
to a sense of what was right. For an hour she <lb/>
awaited a chance of entry, while inside a battle <lb/>
<pb n="159" entity="b000514724_0192"/>
was raging over the proposed arrest of all the <lb/>
Girondin chiefs. Robespierre was urging their <lb/>
destruction; the rope was already round their <lb/>
necks. At length a friend hurried out to bid <lb/>
her not to wait: there was no chance of a hearing <lb/>
&mdash;no hope in any direction.</p>
<p>He persuaded her to return home. Torn with <lb/>
anxiety, she did so, and finding her husband had <lb/>
left the house, returned to the Hall, only to find it <lb/>
deserted. With some difficulty she regained her <lb/>
house, for her carriage was repeatedly stopped on <lb/>
the way. As she was going upstairs a man ran <lb/>
after her with an inquiry for Citizen Roland. She <lb/>
said with truth that she knew nothing of his <reg orig="where-|abouts">whereabouts</reg>, <lb/>
and escaping to her room, embraced her <lb/>
sleeping child, and sat down to write a note to her <lb/>
husband.</p>
<p>Once again came that terrible knocking and the <lb/>
tramp of feet. A band of men from the Conmune <lb/>
entered roughly and bade her give them Roland's <lb/>
address. She again declared her ignorance, <reg orig="where-|upon">whereupon</reg> <lb/>
they left the room. But the sentinel before <lb/>
the door and the guard before the house were <lb/>
significant facts, and she was not surprised when on <lb/>
descending the stairs after a brief sleep, she was at <lb/>
once arrested.</p>
<p>In the pale light of dawn she said good-bye to <lb/>
the weeping servants, and embraced over and over <lb/>
again the terrified Eudora. The streets were full of <lb/>
market-women, who shook their fists at her, crying, <lb/>
"To the guillotine! To the guillotine!"</p>
<p>And then Madame Roland passed to the prison <lb/>
<pb n="160" entity="b000514724_0193"/>
of the Abbaye. There she spent three weeks with <lb/>
wonderful philosophy and calm. Her friends <lb/>
gathered round her, bringing her news of the flight <lb/>
and safe arrival of her husband to the house of <lb/>
people she could trust. Others had taken charge <lb/>
of little Eudora. There was every hope that she <lb/>
would be triumphantly acquitted as before. But <lb/>
her persecutors were men of refined cruelty.</p>
<p>Three weeks after her imprisonment, without a <lb/>
formal trial, she was told that she was free. Joyfully <lb/>
she drove off to her apartments, intending to make <lb/>
her way at once to her child, when two men who <lb/>
had followed her from the prison stopped her on the <lb/>
stairs, saying, "Citoyenne Roland, we arrest you in <lb/>
the name of the law."</p>
<p>It was a cruel blow. Not only had she to struggle <lb/>
against overwhelming disappointment, but she was <lb/>
now imprisoned in Sainte Pelagie, one of the lowest <lb/>
and most sordid of the prisons, in a cell whose thin <lb/>
walls forced her to hear the horrid converse of <lb/>
women of the lowest class, thieves and murderers, <lb/>
on either side. Yet she kept a brave heart, steadily <lb/>
refusing to attempt an escape, which might have <lb/>
been managed by the kindness of her gaoler, for <lb/>
fear of inciting her enemies to greater zeal in the <lb/>
pursuit of her husband.</p>
<p>It was while she lay in prison that Marat was killed <lb/>
by the hand of Charlotte Corday, who hoped in her <lb/>
brave simplicity that the death of this cruel tyrant <lb/>
would set her unhappy country free.</p>
<p>But this only hastened the end of the twenty-one <lb/>
Girondist chiefs who were in captivity. The <reg orig="death-|sentence">death-sentence</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="161" entity="b000514724_0194"/>
was pronounced on them, and they were <lb/>
led to the scaffold, singing the Song of Liberty with <lb/>
their last breath. As yet no mention had been made <lb/>
of Madame Roland. The shadows were deepening <lb/>
round her, however. On the day her friends were <lb/>
executed she was taken to the Conciergerie, from <lb/>
which Marie Antoinette had passed a fortnight <lb/>
previously to the scaffold. Here too she found <lb/>
herself in the company of reprobates, but rousing <lb/>
herself from her depression, she set herself to help, <lb/>
console, and reform them. The worst of the women <lb/>
prisoners became her ardent followers, clung to her <lb/>
skirts, and fought together for the privilege of waiting <lb/>
on her.</p>
<p>One consolation she must have found in the <lb/>
faithful love of two of her oldest friends. First <lb/>
came poor weeping Agatha, the little nun of the <lb/>
Convent of the Congregation, now turned out to <lb/>
fend for herself in an unknown world, who conquered <lb/>
her fears and crept to the prison day by day to <lb/>
lament over her <hi rend="italic">mignonne</hi>.</p>
<p>Then there was Henriette, sister of the once <lb/>
beloved Sophie, who had for many years held the <lb/>
first place in Manon's heart. She was a Royalist, <lb/>
but all differences of political opinion were forgotten <lb/>
now. She was a widow and childless, and she now <lb/>
came to Manon's cell to implore her to change <lb/>
places with her, and so escape to join her husband <lb/>
and daughter.</p>
<p>"But they would kill you, my good Henriette!" <lb/>
Madame Roland reminded her. "Your blood would <lb/>
be on my head! Better suffer a thousand deaths <lb/>
<pb n="162" entity="b000514724_0195"/>
than have to reproach myself with yours!" In <lb/>
vain did this faithful friend implore her just to change <lb/>
clothes and see what would happen. Manon stood <lb/>
firm, and they parted, never to meet again on this <lb/>
earth.</p>
<p>At length the prisoner was summoned before her <lb/>
judges. At this unjust tribunal Madame Roland <lb/>
was her old brave self, clear-headed, straightforward <lb/>
in her answers, facing with the utmost courage the <lb/>
foul accusations that were worse than death. The <lb/>
judges were so hard put to it to find reason for <lb/>
condemning her that they closed the trial which <lb/>
was but a parody of justice, and declared her guilty <lb/>
of death.</p>
<p>She received her sentence with the utmost <reg orig="calm-|ness">calmness</reg>, <lb/>
saying, "You consider me worthy to share the <lb/>
fate of the great men whom you have assassinated. <lb/>
I shall try to carry to the scaffold the courage they <lb/>
have shown."</p>
<p>There was sore lamentation that night in the <lb/>
Conciergerie when the prisoners heard they were <lb/>
about to lose their friend. But she cheered them <lb/>
bravely, saying, "Nay, friends, am I not going to <lb/>
die for my country and liberty? Is it not what we <lb/>
have always wished?"</p>
<p>So the old girlish feeling of love and yearning for <lb/>
the people burnt up strong again in those last hours, <lb/>
and she looked with gentle eyes on the sullen crowd <lb/>
through which the death-cart passed in the dusk of <lb/>
the November day. She had loved the people all <lb/>
her life, and now she was ready to die for them. <lb/>
On that last dread journey she forgot herself in <lb/>
<pb n="163" entity="b000514724_0196"/>
trying to cheer the cowering old forger who shared <lb/>
the death-cart with her. By the etiquette of the <lb/>
scaffold, she should die first; but she resigned the <lb/>
privilege to spare him the horror of seeing her end. <lb/>
Mounting the scaffold with cheerful step, she bowed <lb/>
her head to the statue of Liberty which stood near, <lb/>
saying in a firm voice, "O Liberty! what crimes <lb/>
are committed in thy name!" So died the heroine <lb/>
of the Revolution, the representative of all that <lb/>
was fine and pure and good in that great movement <lb/>
towards liberty and the rights of Man. Her husband <lb/>
did not long survive her. Escape was hopeless, and <lb/>
unable to face a similar fate, he died by his own hand.</p>
<p>But still the name of his noble wife is spoken <lb/>
with awe and gratitude in the country which owes <lb/>
so much to her generous devotion, her single-hearted <lb/>
love, her untiring patriotism.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">To</hi> understand the real value of the life of <lb/>
Hannah More we must put ourselves back <lb/>
into the days when such things as public schools <lb/>
for the children of the poor were unheard of, and <lb/>
when ignorance of the densest kind was supposed <lb/>
to be the only suitable condition for the working <lb/>
man and woman. To teach them merely to read <lb/>
and write was to run a grave danger of "putting <lb/>
them in a wrong position." Anything more <lb/>
advanced in the way of education was considered <lb/>
not only waste of time but wicked presumption on <lb/>
the part of those who attempted it.</p>
<p>The education of the daughters of wealthier parents <lb/>
was in a condition not much further advanced. <lb/>
Nothing existed in the least like our modern schools; <lb/>
the High School girl was an unknown product. <lb/>
Yet here and there we find an eager mind that was <lb/>
not to be fettered by rules of polite ignorance, but <lb/>
sought more keenly after the tree of knowledge by <lb/>
reason of the many lions on the way which must be <lb/>
overcome.</p>
<p>Such a one was Hannah More, the youngest but <lb/>
<pb n="166" entity="b000514724_0201"/>
one of the five daughters of a country <reg orig="grammar-|school">grammar-school</reg> <lb/>
master, living near Stapleton, in <reg orig="Gloucester-|shire">Gloucestershire</reg>. <lb/>
All these little maids were naturally bright <lb/>
and ready to learn, and this was encouraged to a <lb/>
certain extent; for their parents were not at all well <lb/>
off, and it was solemnly impressed upon them that <lb/>
their duty was to qualify themselves as soon as <lb/>
possible for the work of teachers, that they might <lb/>
keep a boarding-school together.</p>
<p>But the subjects which girls might be taught in <lb/>
those days were extremely limited, and when <lb/>
bright little Hannah, who had crept in to listen to <lb/>
lessons given to the grammar - school boys, was <lb/>
found to have some idea of the rudiments of Latin <lb/>
and mathematics, she was sharply recalled to the <lb/>
consideration of studies "more suitable to a young <lb/>
lady."</p>
<p>Nor were these to be obtained under very easy <lb/>
conditions. Mary, the eldest, was sent to a school <lb/>
in Bristol, kept by some French ladies. Here she <lb/>
was instructed in French, the use of the globes, <lb/>
needlework, arithmetic taught without any <reg orig="under-|standing">understanding</reg> <lb/>
of its principles, and such high-sounding <lb/>
things as "orthography and caligraphy," under <lb/>
which we recognise the more familiar "spelling and <lb/>
writing."</p>
<p>But the most remarkable part of such an <reg orig="educa-|tion">education</reg> <lb/>
is the part taken in it by the four little sisters <lb/>
at home.</p>
<p>Every Saturday evening the good, hard-working <lb/>
Mary returned home, her mind overflowing with <lb/>
scraps of knowledge, all of which were faithfully <lb/>
<pb n="167" entity="b000514724_0202"/>
imparted forthwith to Elizabeth, Sarah, Hannah, and <lb/>
Martha, generally known as "Patty."</p>
<p>Nor was such a means of learning as futile as one <lb/>
might have thought, for we hear that about this <lb/>
time Mr. More, who had invited some French <lb/>
officers to dine, found himself embarrassed by not <lb/>
being able to understand a word of their language.</p>
<p>Then Hannah shyly volunteered to be interpreter, <lb/>
and to her parents' intense though carefully <reg orig="con-|cealed">concealed</reg> <lb/>
pride, was heartily complimented by the <lb/>
foreigners on the way in which she maintained the <lb/>
conversation. She was then about ten years of <lb/>
age, and before another two years had passed away <lb/>
her elder sisters' education was supposed to be <lb/>
complete, and she and Patty, the youngest, were <lb/>
sent off with them to Bristol to open the school.</p>
<p>It must have been a serious adventure in those <lb/>
days of fragile and dependent young women. "We <lb/>
went to seek our fortunes," wrote Sally, the second <lb/>
girl, in later days, "with a bottle of water, a bed, <lb/>
and a blanket. We found a great house with <lb/>
nothing in it, and empty it was likely to remain, <lb/>
till looking into our knowledge-boxes, we happened <lb/>
to find a little <hi rend="italic">larning</hi>&mdash;a good thing when land is <lb/>
gone, or rather none; and so at last, by giving a <lb/>
little of this <hi rend="italic">larning</hi> to those who had less, we got a <lb/>
good store of gold in return."</p>
<p>The school was clearly a great success, for it <lb/>
soon had quite a famous reputation in Bristol; and <lb/>
the young head-mistress with her three girlish <lb/>
assistants became well-known figures in the society <lb/>
of the place. Hannah's part in its organisation <lb/>
<pb n="168" entity="b000514724_0203"/>
must have been that of pupil to begin with. She <lb/>
was never very strong, and the unselfish elder <lb/>
sisters seem to have guarded her carefully from <lb/>
beginning to teach too early, and to have arranged <lb/>
for her a freer and more varied education than fell <lb/>
to the lot of most girls of her age. She was allowed <lb/>
to learn Latin, as well as Spanish and Italian, which <lb/>
she soon mastered sufficiently well to be able to <lb/>
enjoy the poetry of each language.</p>
<p>Better still, perhaps, instead of having each <lb/>
moment of the day mapped out for her, she was <lb/>
given plenty of free time, with permission to fill it <lb/>
as she liked. She had always possessed the <lb/>
"mania for scribbling," as the Latin poets call it, and <lb/>
a lively imagination now produced an endless series <lb/>
of poems and essays, none of which seem to have <lb/>
been worthy of much attention, till we come to a little <lb/>
pastoral play, called the <hi rend="italic">Search after Happiness,</hi> <lb/>
written for her sisters' pupils&mdash;very tedious to the <lb/>
minds of modern girls, but considered in those days <lb/>
a most happy and witty production.</p>
<p>One gift Hannah possessed, to which the girl of <lb/>
to-day scarcely dreams of attaining. She could not <lb/>
only read and enjoy books of all kinds, as well <lb/>
as take a deep interest in the politics and other <lb/>
topics of the day, but she could discuss them <lb/>
afterwards in a sensible and interesting fashion. In <lb/>
our age the art of conversation is well-nigh lost. <lb/>
It is the rarest thing in the world to find a girl, <lb/>
well educated at school or college though she may <lb/>
be, able to talk at any length, with reflection and <lb/>
without egotism, on any subject of importance.</p>
<pb n="169" entity="b000514724_0204"/>
<p>But we hear that Hannah at the age of sixteen, <lb/>
when laid low by a dangerous illness, was able so <lb/>
to talk and interest the doctor who was visiting her, <lb/>
that not until he had said good-bye and was <reg orig="half-|way">halfway</reg> <lb/>
down the stairs did he recall to himself the <lb/>
reason he had come; and with much amusement <lb/>
Mary heard him exclaim, "Bless me, I forgot to ask <lb/>
the girl how she was!"</p>
<p>This illness left her a slight and delicate maiden, <lb/>
with the bright eyes and eager look that generally <lb/>
accompany a sensitive and nervous temperament. <lb/>
From this time, too, she was subject to the terrible <lb/>
headaches which were a recurring trouble for the <lb/>
rest of her life, though in their intervals, like many <lb/>
delicate girls, she was unusually full of life and <lb/>
vigour.</p>
<p>When Hannah was twenty-two, she came into <lb/>
possession, through the generosity of a friend, of a <lb/>
private income, and so at once gave up her share in <lb/>
the school. And now she was able to carry out a <lb/>
girlish dream foreshadowed when she was a tiny <lb/>
child and was found riding on a gate.</p>
<p>"Where are you going?" asked her mother.</p>
<p>"I am riding to London to see bishops and <reg orig="book-|sellers">booksellers</reg>!" <lb/>
replied the child; and now she could <lb/>
actually carry out her design. The charms of <lb/>
"bishops" were no longer so strong, and paled <lb/>
before those of "booksellers," and still more, of the <lb/>
literary circles which gathered round the latter. It <lb/>
was the London of Doctor Johnson, whose strong <lb/>
personality and resolute opinions carried all before <lb/>
him in the world of letters. Judge, then, the delight <lb/>
<pb n="170" entity="b000514724_0205"/>
of the provincial Miss More, who had been considered <lb/>
a wit in Bristol, but whose warm admiration for the <lb/>
great man and his friends might well have made her <lb/>
but a distant worshipper at their shrines, to find that <lb/>
her reputation had preceded her. Miss Reynolds, <lb/>
sister of the great Sir Joshua, was known slightly to <lb/>
her, and this kindly lady soon made her acquainted <lb/>
with all the celebrities, who received Hannah with <lb/>
the utmost warmth.</p>
<p>Diffidence was out of fashion, and the girl's <lb/>
way of openly expressing her admiration for the <lb/>
"lions" made those great and terrible beasts roar <lb/>
very softly to the tune of the compliments paid by <lb/>
her.</p>
<p>Once, indeed, she overdid it in the case of Doctor <lb/>
Johnson himself, who told her crossly that she should <lb/>
consider what her praise was worth before she forced <lb/>
it on him; but he must have soon forgiven her, for <lb/>
her sister Sarah, who was often her companion, <lb/>
records many delightful conversations in which the <lb/>
great man called her "child," and more than once <lb/>
gave his emphatic approval, "You are right, <lb/>
madam," to her opinion. David Garrick, the great <lb/>
actor, and his charming wife, were also her great <lb/>
friends. With them she usually stayed when in <lb/>
town, and he it was who gave her the nickname <lb/>
of "Nine," because she was supposed to combine in <lb/>
herself the talents of the Nine Muses.</p>
<p>Hannah was soon admitted to the circle of "<reg orig='blue-|stockings"&mdash;the'>bluestockings"&mdash;the</reg> <lb/>
learned ladies who circled round <lb/>
Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, and quickly became <lb/>
one of the best-known members of London society. <lb/>
<pb n="171" entity="b000514724_0206"/>
She stood boldly apart, however, from its follies and <lb/>
negligences; for she jeers openly at the fashion <lb/>
which made ladies wear on their heads "an acre <lb/>
and a half of shrubbery between them; besides slopes, <lb/>
grass-plats, tulip-beds, clumps of peonies, <reg orig="kitchen-|gardens">kitchen-gardens</reg>, <lb/>
and green-houses." She was shocked at <lb/>
the ignorance of the same class, members of which, <lb/>
when crowding to see Reynolds' picture of the <reg orig="kneel-|ing">kneeling</reg> <lb/>
child Samuel, asked openly who Samuel was; <lb/>
and she boldly refused to take part in the <reg orig="entertain-|ments">entertainments</reg> <lb/>
in which most of Sunday was spent by the <lb/>
frivolous party of fashion.</p>
<p>There were times, too, when Hannah was not <lb/>
sorry to return to the quiet home of her elder sisters, <lb/>
and it was there that she began her literary career <lb/>
with a ballad and two dramas, all of which were <lb/>
most successful at the time. They are rightly <lb/>
forgotten now: their instant success was due to their <lb/>
hitting the popular taste, and they lacked that <lb/>
touch of universal thought and portrayal which <lb/>
would have kept them fresh in later years.</p>
<p>The death of Garrick and a long stay with his <lb/>
grief-stricken widow turned Hannah's mind to <lb/>
graver themes. She was growing older, too, and <lb/>
her mind was gradually seeking the strongly <lb/>
religious paths on which she was to find her future <lb/>
life-work. She wrote at this time, for the instruction <lb/>
of ignorant and godless London society, a little <lb/>
collection of sacred plays based on actual Biblical <lb/>
events. A few years later, the death of her greatest <lb/>
hero, Doctor Johnson, detached her from this society <lb/>
for ever.</p>
<pb n="172" entity="b000514724_0207"/>
<p>She had knelt by his side at his last public <lb/>
Communion in St. Clement's Church, and had <lb/>
treasured all the kindly last words of a truly <lb/>
religious and great-hearted man. But she <reg orig="under-|stood">understood</reg> <lb/>
him so little that when she read the proofs <lb/>
of Boswell's biography, she implored him to soften <lb/>
some of the rough speeches and snarling retorts <lb/>
recorded there. Whereupon "Bozzy" very wisely <lb/>
replied to her entreaties that he would not cut off <lb/>
his hero's claws nor make a tiger a cat to please <lb/>
anybody.</p>
<p>Soon after Doctor Johnson's death, Hannah More <lb/>
retired almost altogether from London life, and <lb/>
spent much of her time in a pleasant country <lb/>
village near Bristol, known as Cowslip Green. <lb/>
Here she wrote anonymously a little book, attacking <lb/>
boldly the "Manners of the Great," which, in spite <lb/>
of its open denunciation of the very people amongst <lb/>
whom she had so lately moved, was received <lb/>
with such favour that this epigram, by an anonymous <lb/>
writer, was sent to her:&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"Of sense and religion in this little book</l>
<l rend="indent">All agree there's a wonderful store;</l>
<l>But while round the world for an author they look,</l>
<l rend="indent">I only am wishing for '<hi rend="italic">More</hi>.'"</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>In spite of all this energy, and in spite also of <lb/>
the fact that she had reached her forty - fourth <lb/>
year, Hannah was only about to begin the great <lb/>
work of her life.</p>
<p>In the year 1789 she joined her sisters, who <lb/>
had now retired from school-work, in a permanent <lb/>
<pb n="173" entity="b000514724_0208"/>
home at Cowslip Green. There they were visited <lb/>
by Wilberforce, who was in those days almost as <lb/>
much interested in the condition of the English <lb/>
poor as in the Slavery question. In this charming <lb/>
spot, indeed, about ten miles from the famous <lb/>
scenery of Cheddar, he found a state of heathendom <lb/>
and miserable ignorance which can scarcely be <lb/>
believed. There were no resident clergy; a curate <lb/>
served four parishes by riding post-haste from one <lb/>
to the other on a Sunday, giving barely time for <lb/>
a gabbled service between, and the fact of his <lb/>
drinking at the ale-house with the farmers effectually <lb/>
hindered any feeling of reverence for his <reg orig="ministra-|tions">ministrations</reg>. <lb/>
The farmers were of a rude, ignorant type, <lb/>
and strongly averse from anything that would <lb/>
tend to raise the humble position of the peasant. <lb/>
They frankly told the Miss Mores that the country <lb/>
had never prospered since religion had been <lb/>
"brought in" by the monks of Glastonbury; <lb/>
judging from this, the condition of their servants, <lb/>
the cottagers, may be imagined. They were <lb/>
scarcely better than savages in their behaviour, <lb/>
or than heathen in their religious ideas.</p>
<p>So Wilberforce promised to find the money if <lb/>
some of the ladies of the place would find the <lb/>
work. Most of them shrank from contact with <lb/>
the rough farmers, whose opposition to any plans <lb/>
of reform must first be overcome.</p>
<p>But Hannah and Patty, her favourite younger <lb/>
sister, stood boldly in the breach. "I tamed and <lb/>
stroked the insolence of these petty tyrants," <lb/>
writes the former to Mr. Wilberforce. "I fondled <lb/>
<pb n="174" entity="b000514724_0209"/>
their ugly children, caressed their spaniels, <reg orig="com-|mended">commended</reg> <lb/>
their cider, and even swallowed their <lb/>
wine."</p>
<p>These wily methods were crowned with success. <lb/>
The aim of the sisters was to civilise the people <lb/>
gradually by educating the children; and by <reg orig="per-|suading">persuading</reg> <lb/>
the farmers that this plan would not only <lb/>
secure their orchards from being robbed and their <lb/>
chickens stolen, but would also lower the poor rates, <lb/>
they gained the hearty assent of the masters to the <lb/>
scheme.</p>
<p>In the largest of the group of villages a disused <lb/>
vicarage was opened as a school, and by various <lb/>
bribes and threats the youth of the surrounding <lb/>
district was gathered in.</p>
<p>They were not promising pupils. "Several of <lb/>
the big boys," she says, "had been tried at the last <lb/>
assizes. Three were the children of a person under <lb/>
sentence of death; many were thieves; all ignorant, <lb/>
profane, and vicious."</p>
<p>Other schools were started in the district, and <lb/>
with great difficulty mistresses were found for them. <lb/>
These were generally elderly women, too old for any <lb/>
other kind of work, and certainly not the best of <lb/>
teachers; but it was not necessary to appoint a very <lb/>
learned person when only reading, knitting, and <lb/>
sewing were taught, with the Bible and Catechism <lb/>
on Sundays. Miss Hannah and Miss Patty kept a <lb/>
sharp eye upon teachers and pupils, visiting one <lb/>
or the other of the schools with the greatest <lb/>
regularity.</p>
<p>Next year the ignorance of a wider region was <lb/>
<pb n="175" entity="b000514724_0210"/>
grappled with. It was no easy task. The villagers <lb/>
of the Mendip country objected to allow their <lb/>
children to go to school, on the score that after <lb/>
seven years of such instruction the ladies would be <lb/>
entitled to sell their pupils as slaves beyond the <lb/>
seas! One village was peopled by such savages <lb/>
that no policeman dared to show his face there. <lb/>
When with much difficulty about a hundred children <lb/>
were gathered together in a schoolroom, not one <lb/>
of them could answer the question "Who made <lb/>
you?"</p>
<p>The most encouraging part of the work, however, <lb/>
was the enormous difference made in the lives of <lb/>
these poor people by the influence of the teaching <lb/>
brought to bear on them. Sunday after Sunday <lb/>
one or other of the centres was visited by the <lb/>
ladies, and very soon they got to know the boys <lb/>
and girls quite intimately.</p>
<p>Peace and order began to reign in a region <lb/>
where at one time every man's hand was against <lb/>
his fellow. Far and wide the reform brought <lb/>
about by these two energetic women became <lb/>
known, and Hannah was urged by outsiders to <lb/>
write some short tales, with a clear moral attached, <lb/>
in order that the influence of such a clear-sighted, <lb/>
healthy personality might be spread abroad. <lb/>
Nowadays these stories are scoffed at sometimes <lb/>
as "pious tracts," but in those times, when books <lb/>
were almost unknown luxuries to the poor, and <lb/>
even to the children of the rich, they were <lb/>
welcomed most heartily.</p>
<p>But one seldom finds a woman so perfectly <lb/>
<pb n="176" entity="b000514724_0211"/>
outspoken and determined in her actions as Hannah <lb/>
More allowed to continue her work of reform without <lb/>
opposition.</p>
<p>Partly from jealousy of her undoubtedly supreme <lb/>
position in the parishes whose children she had <lb/>
educated, partly from misunderstandings of one <lb/>
kind or another, a fierce storm of accusation and <lb/>
abuse broke upon her. Some accused her of <lb/>
setting up schools in which thieving and lying <lb/>
were openly taught; others of praying for the <lb/>
success of the French, then our mortal foes.</p>
<p>In spite of all this, the two ladies bravely <lb/>
continued their work, though they were obliged <lb/>
to leave Cowslip Green and settle elsewhere in <lb/>
the district. A long illness was the result of <lb/>
worry and over-work, and after she recovered, it <lb/>
was only to see one after another of her sisters <lb/>
called away. Her beloved Patty was the last to <lb/>
go, and for a time it seemed as though the one <lb/>
surviving sister would soon follow her. But <lb/>
Hannah recovered, and took up the burden of life <lb/>
again with her usual cheerful spirit. For thirteen <lb/>
years she lived on, full of work, writing, planning, <lb/>
and above all receiving countless visitors who came <lb/>
to her in her old age for help and advice on every <lb/>
kind of subject.</p>
<p>No doubt she became somewhat of a female <lb/>
pope in those days; but one can easily forgive her <lb/>
when one remembers her long life of strenuous <lb/>
endeavour for the improvement of her fellow-men, <lb/>
the generations she had seen brought up according <lb/>
to her ideas, and the immense advance in education, <lb/>
<pb n="177" entity="b000514724_0212"/>
both moral and intellectual, of which she had been <lb/>
the mainspring. Not that she approved by any <lb/>
means of this march of intellect. She forgot that <lb/>
we can more easily send a boulder rolling down <lb/>
a slope than stop it in mid-career, and was greatly <lb/>
shocked when on questioning a small country <lb/>
maid as to what she was learning at school, she was <lb/>
told, "Please'm, I learns geography and the harts <lb/>
and senses!"</p>
<p>She died very quietly in the year 1833, with the <lb/>
name of her best-loved sister on her lips, leaving <lb/>
behind her a grateful memory in the minds of <lb/>
thousands of men and women who would have <lb/>
passed their days in ignorance, not only of the <lb/>
elements of education, but of the simplest truths of <lb/>
the Christian faith, had it not been for her wise <lb/>
thought and care for them.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> number of excellent stories written by <lb/>
women in these latter days make it very <lb/>

attached to the quiet little lady who, in the year <lb/>

of <hi rend="italic">Evelina</hi>.</p>
<p>Yet even now the book makes its writer almost <lb/>
unique, for it possesses a characteristic that is still <lb/>

of humour and satire. The experiences of the <lb/>
young heroine, well connected on one side, who <lb/>
goes to visit her mother's ill-bred relatives, are <lb/>
described with a caustic touch and an unerring <lb/>
fidelity which make the vulgar cousins with <lb/>
their common talk and amusing ignorance as <lb/>
alive to-day as they were then, although their <lb/>
outward manners are exclusively those of the <lb/>
eighteenth century. But we must leave <hi rend="italic">Evelina</hi> <lb/>
to tell her own story, and hasten on to that of <lb/>
her creator.</p>
<pb n="180" entity="b000514724_0217"/>
<p>Fanny Burney was born in 1752 at Lynn, in <lb/>
Norfolk; but her father, Dr. Burney, soon migrated <lb/>
to London in order to obtain music pupils, and <lb/>
it was in the tall narrow house in Poland Street <lb/>
that Fanny passed most of the first half of her <lb/>
long life of eighty-seven years. She must have <lb/>
always had a quick eye for the peculiarities of <lb/>
others, for before she was ten she would come <lb/>
back from the plays, for which her father's <reg orig="friend-|ship">friendship</reg> <lb/>
with Garrick the actor gave frequent opportunity, <lb/>
and "take off" the actors, composing the most <lb/>
absurd speeches for them, to the great amusement <lb/>
of her elders. It was not often, however, that <lb/>
little Fanny could be induced to parade her talent <lb/>
for mimicry.</p>
<p>Usually she was the most retiring and staid of <lb/>
maidens, with a grave little brown face, and a gift <lb/>
for silence that made her appear so dull and <lb/>
unresponsive that her sisters called her "the <lb/>
little dunce." It is true that at eight years old <lb/>
Fanny could not read; but that is hardly wonderful, <lb/>
since she had no teaching whatever beyond being <lb/>
allowed to listen while her mother read aloud <lb/>
Pope's <hi rend="italic">Virgil</hi> to her elder sister. Some kindly <lb/>
visitor seems to have been officious enough to <lb/>
point out the backwardness of the child, and Mrs. <lb/>
Burney's "Oh, I have no fear about Fanny," must <lb/>
have rung pleasantly in the burning ears of her <lb/>
small daughter.</p>
<p>But this keen-eyed mother died when Fanny <lb/>
was eleven years old, and then all hope of regular <lb/>
teaching vanished. Her two elder sisters were <lb/>
<pb n="181" entity="b000514724_0218"/>
sent to school in France; but Dr. Burney, busy <lb/>
and careless man, took no heed whatever of <lb/>
the little brown mouse who crept so often into <lb/>
his library, or sat in a far-off corner during <lb/>
his frequent tea or supper parties, watching his <lb/>
guests.</p>
<p>To listen to many of these last was an education <lb/>
in itself. Garrick, the actor, had been for years a <lb/>
well-known and adored visitor to the nursery of the <lb/>
Burney children, and her father's musical reputation <lb/>
brought to his house all the notable musicians and <lb/>
artists of the day. Even the great Doctor Johnson, <lb/>
the "Dictator" of literary London, would come <lb/>
occasionally and hold forth over the teacups in <lb/>
the Burney drawing-room. The Doctor's house, <lb/>
indeed, became a kind of centre of all kinds of <lb/>
remarkable people of every rank, and these, quite <lb/>
unknown to themselves, provided an open book <lb/>
of human nature in all its peculiarities, which the <lb/>
shy child in her secluded corner was not slow to <lb/>
read.</p>
<p>By this time one of her sisters had shown her <lb/>
how to write, and from that period Fanny was <reg orig="com-|pletely">completely</reg> <lb/>
happy in a world of her own invention. <lb/>
What was the result of this we have no means <lb/>
of knowing; for when she was about sixteen, <lb/>
her father married again. Her stepmother, <lb/>
though a wise and sensible woman, fully shared <lb/>
in the prejudices of her time against "girlish <lb/>
scribbling."</p>
<p>In those days, indeed, it was only just beginning <lb/>
to be anything but improper for a woman to write <lb/>
<pb n="182" entity="b000514724_0219"/>
novels; and Mrs. Burney's unmistakable hints made <lb/>
the path of duty clear to poor Fanny. She <lb/>
determined to burn all she had written. Her <lb/>
sister Susannah, her only confidante, wept at the <lb/>
thought of the sacrifice; but Fanny was adamant. <lb/>
She allowed herself, however, one safety-valve. <lb/>
Like most girls of her age and temperament, she <lb/>
kept a Journal, "in which I must confess my <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">every</hi> thought, must open my whole heart." And <lb/>
this served as a kind of apprenticeship to her future <lb/>
work.</p>
<p>Her mornings were now spent in diligent <reg orig="needle-|work">needlework</reg>; <lb/>
but the busiest needle does not prevent <lb/>
thought. One of the martyred manuscripts had <lb/>
been a "History of Caroline Evelyn," the tale of <lb/>
a beautiful girl of the lower middle class who <lb/>
had married a nobleman. She had been <lb/>
given a daughter, whom she called "Evelina." <lb/>
And now Fanny's active mind began to sketch <lb/>
out the future career of this young lady. <lb/>
The "elegant" tastes of Miss Evelina must <lb/>
inevitably lead to absurd effects and ridiculous <lb/>
positions when she was obliged to mix with her <lb/>
relations on one side of the family. With what a <lb/>
vivid pen she might paint the story of "a young <lb/>
lady's entrance into the world" if she only had the <lb/>
opportunity!</p>
<p>At length the longing grew too strong to be <lb/>
withstood. We do not know exactly when the <lb/>
manuscript was actually begun. Probably the tale <lb/>
took shape almost completely in the girl's mind <lb/>
before she determined that the days of "propriety" <lb/>
<pb n="183" entity="b000514724_0220"/>
and hem-stitching should not last for ever. At <lb/>
any rate, it was not until she was twenty-six that <lb/>
the story was given to the world.</p>
<p>It was kept, whilst in the writing, a profound <lb/>
secret from all save her sisters and younger brother. <lb/>
But when the first two volumes were finished she <lb/>
began to feel, as she tells us, "an odd inclination <lb/>
to see it in print." So she copied it out in a <lb/>
feigned handwriting, in order that her identity <lb/>
might be completely hidden, and aiming, like most <lb/>
young authors, at the highest mark, she offered the <lb/>
manuscript to Dodsley, the famous publisher of <lb/>
that day. But Dodsley would have nothing to <lb/>
say to an anonymous author; and so the girl <lb/>
made her next proposal to Lowndes, a bookseller <lb/>
in the City. Every precaution was taken to <reg orig="pre-|serve">preserve</reg> <lb/>
her incognito. She wrote under the name <lb/>
of "Grafton," and had her letters addressed to a <lb/>
coffee-house.</p>
<p>It was from thence that her young brother <lb/>
brought the reply. The bookseller liked the <lb/>
story, and was inclined to purchase it, but only <lb/>
on condition that the third volume was completed <lb/>
and submitted to him at once. This set Fanny <lb/>
to work in the highest spirits, damped only by <lb/>
one consideration: there was no reasonable doubt <lb/>
that this first child of her brain would shortly appear <lb/>
in print, the truth as to the identity of its author <lb/>
would then come out&mdash;and so her father must be <lb/>
told. The amount of courage that this needed <lb/>
shows distinct lack of sympathy between parent <lb/>
and child. But we must again remind ourselves <lb/>
<pb n="184" entity="b000514724_0221"/>
that it was, with very few exceptions, before the <lb/>
days of famous women of letters&mdash;or rather of <lb/>
famous novelists who were also respectable and <lb/>
upright women.</p>
<p>At last the plunge was taken. With trembling <lb/>
voice she asked her father's leave to "print a book"; <lb/>
and Dr. Burney, who had never for one instant <lb/>
realised his clever daughter, stared, laughed, kissed <lb/>
her, bade her do as she liked, and finally bustled <lb/>
away without even asking what the book was about. <lb/>
The way was now clear.</p>
<p>Without more family consultations, Fanny <reg orig="pro-|fessed">professed</reg> <lb/>
herself pleased to take whatever terms her <lb/>
publisher chose to mention, and was overcome <lb/>
with joy and gratitude when he sent her twenty <lb/>
pounds! It has been often pointed out that this <lb/>
negligence on Dr. Burney's part cost his daughter <lb/>
from twelve to fifteen hundred pounds. But we <lb/>
have good authority for knowing that a man, and <lb/>
much less a woman, is never a prophet in his <lb/>
father's house. Nor can we blame the <reg orig="book-|seller">bookseller</reg> <lb/>
for the small sum paid to Miss Burney <lb/>
when we remember that he was probably quite <lb/>
unaware of the genius that lay between those <lb/>
pages, and which only popular opinion could <lb/>
establish.</p>
<p>One January morning in the year 1778, Mrs. <lb/>
Burney, as she sat at the breakfast-table, read aloud <lb/>
the announcement of a new book, <hi rend="italic">Evelina; or, A <lb/>
Young Lady's Entrance into the World</hi>, while the <lb/>
author sat sick and trembling at this first intimation <lb/>
of the launching of her brain-child. With a morbid <lb/>
<pb n="185" entity="b000514724_0222"/>
terror of publicity which yet longed for public <lb/>
recognition of its merits, she would not go out of <lb/>
doors for days for fear she should hear of some <lb/>
adverse or insulting opinion. But at first nothing <lb/>
seemed to be said about it at all.</p>
<p>Then of a sudden the literary and reading world <lb/>
woke up.</p>
<p>The clerks of the circulating libraries reported that <lb/>
everyone was asking for a book called <hi rend="italic">Evelina</hi>, and <lb/>
everyone else was inquiring the name of the <lb/>
author. All kinds of famous men were suggested <lb/>
&mdash;no one seems to have dreamt that it could <lb/>
have been written by a woman. The author's <lb/>
own family were full of pride and excitement. <lb/>
Dr. Burney wept over its pages with joy; a <lb/>
friend of his told Mrs. Thrale, the leader of the <lb/>
literary "coteries" of the day, and she gave the <lb/>
book to Doctor Johnson. The great man was most <lb/>
unwilling to read it, but it completely won his <lb/>
heart. "Why, madam, what a charming book you <lb/>
lent me!" he remarked; and these words, reported <lb/>
in haste at Poland Street, sent the usually staid <lb/>
Fanny into such raptures of joy that she had to <lb/>
relieve her feelings by dancing round the mulberry <lb/>
bush in the garden.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Evelina</hi> at once opened the gates of fashionable <lb/>
and literary society to the Doctor's daughter, and <lb/>
she quickly became the darling of the exclusive <lb/>
circle at Streatham over which Mrs. Thrale and <lb/>
Doctor Johnson were the ruling deities. She had no <lb/>
personal beauty to recommend her. She was short <lb/>
and brown, with a large humorous mouth and <lb/>
<pb n="186" entity="b000514724_0223"/>
"expressive eyebrows." But her wit, her quiet <lb/>
power of gentle sarcasm, and her quick <reg orig="intui-|tions">intuitions</reg> <lb/>
soon made her a general favourite. Johnson <lb/>
loved and treated her as a child, and would <lb/>
scarcely let her leave his side when she <lb/>
visited the Thrales. She was his "sweet, dear <lb/>
little Burney," and he even tried, much against <lb/>
her will, to teach her Latin&mdash;his highest mark <lb/>
of female approbation. Burke, Gibbon, Reynolds, <lb/>
and other great men sang her praises without <lb/>
stint.</p>
<p>No wonder she set to work again with a light <lb/>
heart, in order to give <hi rend="italic">Cecilia</hi>, her second novel, <lb/>
to the delighted world.</p>
<p>But her life was not to be one unbroken record <lb/>
of joy and happiness, though success, as far as her <lb/>
stories are concerned, never failed her. Her first <lb/>
friends began to pass away. Johnson, mindful of <lb/>
his "dear little Evelina Burney" to the last, was dead. <lb/>
Mrs. Thrale had passed into a circle whither Fanny <lb/>
could not follow her. She formed an acquaintance <lb/>
with a new friend, a Mrs. Delany, who enjoyed a <lb/>
royal pension and lived in a house at Windsor <lb/>
belonging to the Crown; and this led to serious <lb/>
consequences.</p>
<p>"In December 1785," says her Diary, "I was on a <lb/>
visit to Mrs. Delany at Windsor. The dinner was over. <lb/>
The old lady was taking a nap. Her grandniece, <lb/>
a little girl of seven, was playing at some Christmas <lb/>
game with the visitors, when the door opened, and <lb/>
a stout gentleman entered unannounced, with a star <lb/>
on his breast, and 'What? What? What?' in his <lb/>
<pb n="187" entity="b000514724_0224"/>
mouth. A cry of 'The King!' was set up. A <lb/>
general scampering followed." Miss Burney owns <lb/>
that she could not have been more terrified if she <lb/>
had seen a ghost. But Mrs. Delany went forth to <lb/>
pay her duty to her royal friend, and the disturbance <lb/>
was quieted. Fanny was then presented, and <lb/>
underwent a long examination and cross-<reg orig="examina-|tion">examination</reg> <lb/>
about all that she had written and all that she <lb/>
meant to write.</p>
<p>Then the Queen appeared upon the scene, and an <lb/>
"intellectual conversation" seems to have followed <lb/>
between the three, during which we can imagine <lb/>
our Fanny's difficulty in answering when His <lb/>
Majesty exclaimed, "Was there ever such stuff <lb/>
as great part of Shakespeare? Only one must not <lb/>
say so. But what think you? What? Is there <lb/>
not sad stuff? What? What?"</p>
<p>The result of this and similar meetings was that <lb/>
when the office of Keeper of the Robe fell vacant <lb/>
a little later, the Queen at once offered the <lb/>
post to Miss Burney at the salary of two hundred <lb/>
pounds a year. The income was dearly bought at <lb/>
the price of liberty, leisure for writing, <reg orig="intel-|lectual">intellectual</reg> <lb/>
companions, and the position which her <lb/>
books had now gained for her in the literary <lb/>
world.</p>
<p>Five of the best years of her life were spent in <lb/>
this dreary form of aristocratic drudgery. Her <lb/>
Diary gives a picture of all those long days in the <lb/>
history of one. She had to be up and dressed <lb/>
before half-past seven, in order that she might attend <lb/>
punctually to dress her royal mistress. Breakfast <lb/>
<pb n="188" entity="b000514724_0225"/>
was at eight, and the remainder of the morning was <lb/>
spent in rearranging chests of drawers and folding <lb/>
and refolding fine gowns. After this the Queen <lb/>
must be powdered and dressed for the day. Twice <lb/>
a week her hair was curled and crimped, so that <lb/>
altogether Fanny was seldom free till three o'clock, <lb/>
and was then too weary to do aught but write up <lb/>
her Diary.</p>
<p>From five o'clock till nine she was obliged <lb/>
to be the companion of her German colleague, <lb/>
Madame Schwellenberg, a most unattractive old <lb/>
woman, who used her few words of English to <lb/>
express the scorn and contempt she had for one <lb/>
who had so demeaned herself as to write a <lb/>
book. So, in self-protection, though she hated <lb/>
the sight of a card, poor Fanny sat at the <reg orig="card-|table">card-table</reg>, <lb/>
and as Macaulay well puts it, "consented with <lb/>
patient sadness to give hours which might have <lb/>
called forth the laughter and the tears of many <lb/>
generations, to the king of clubs and the knave of <lb/>
spades."</p>
<p>Then once more, between eleven and twelve, <lb/>
the bell summoned her to the Queen's bedroom, <lb/>
this time for the purpose of undressing Her <lb/>
Majesty. And then, worn out, she might go to <lb/>
bed.</p>
<p>The monotony was not the worst part of it. The <lb/>
strain of standing for hours, often without food, <lb/>
told heavily upon her. She describes how on the <lb/>
occasion of the royal visit to Oxford she had been <lb/>
on her feet all day in attendance on her mistress, <lb/>
and being left alone for a moment in a "parlour" <lb/>
<pb n="189" entity="b000514724_0226"/>
at Magdalene College, she sank down upon a chair. <lb/>
One of the equerries, seeing she was well-nigh <lb/>
fainting with hunger and fatigue, good-naturedly <lb/>
shared with her some apricots and bread which he <lb/>
had wisely put into his pockets. Just as she had <lb/>
thankfully taken the food, the door opened and the <lb/>
Queen appeared. They sprang to their aching feet; <lb/>
the food was hurriedly concealed. "I found," says <lb/>
she, "that our appetites were to be supposed <reg orig="anni-|hilated">annihilated</reg>, <lb/>
at the same moment that our strength was <lb/>
to be invincible."</p>
<p>Only one really exciting incident occurred to make <lb/>
the long years less dreary. The Queen was much <lb/>
interested in the trial of Warren Hastings at <lb/>
the bar of the House of Peers, and she sent Miss <lb/>
Burney to Westminster Hall to watch the <reg orig="pro-|ceedings">proceedings</reg>. <lb/>
Fanny at once became a warm partisan of <lb/>
the defendant, and would scarcely acknowledge <lb/>
Burke's "marked civility" because he was of those <lb/>
who attacked him. But such interludes were few <lb/>
and far between, and at length her health could <lb/>
no longer endure the strain. It was with the <lb/>
utmost difficulty that she made her escape from the <lb/>
Palace. The Queen, though she could not help <lb/>
observing the failing strength, the shortened breath <lb/>
and feverish touch, preferred to let her go on <lb/>
until, as she bitterly says, "her attendant fell dead <lb/>
at her feet."</p>
<p>Her father, too, preferred his connection with <lb/>
Royalty to his daughter's health, even in spite of a <lb/>
pathetic appeal in which she told him plainly that <lb/>
"she was miserable, worn with attendance and <lb/>
<pb n="190" entity="b000514724_0227"/>
want of sleep, that she had no comfort in life, <lb/>
nothing to love, nothing to hope, that her family <lb/>
and friends were to her as though they were not, <lb/>
and were remembered by her as men remember <lb/>
the dead. From daybreak to midnight the same <lb/>
killing labour, the same recreations, more hateful <lb/>
than labour itself, followed each other <reg orig="with-|out">without</reg> <lb/>
variety, without any interval of liberty and <lb/>
repose." Yet he persuaded her to continue, and <lb/>
for another six months the misery had to be <lb/>
endured.</p>
<p>At length her wretched state of health began to <lb/>
be noised in the society she had been forced <reg orig="un-|willingly">unwillingly</reg> <lb/>
to desert.</p>
<p>Good fussy Boswell made his way into the <lb/>
Palace itself, in order to persuade her to give up. <lb/>
"Why, dear ma'am, why do you stay? It won't <lb/>
do, ma'am; you must resign. We can put up with <lb/>
it no longer. Some very violent measures, I <lb/>
assure you, will be taken. We shall address Dr. <lb/>
Burney in a body."</p>
<p>Horace Walpole and other men of note took up <lb/>
the same cry. The doctors joined in with an <lb/>
assurance of speedy death unless she were removed. <lb/>
Her father's reluctance is almost incredible, but <lb/>
once overcome, he grew frightened, and pressed the <lb/>
matter on.</p>
<p>But the Queen, though outwardly calm and <lb/>
gentle, was not willing to let the prisoned bird fly <lb/>
from its gilded cage. One excuse after another <lb/>
was given to delay her departure, and when at <lb/>
length she left the Palace she had scarcely <lb/>
<pb n="191" entity="b000514724_0228"/>
strength to reach her home. The return to a more <lb/>
rational way of living soon restored her shattered <lb/>
nerves and broken health, however; and with all <lb/>
her old eagerness she threw herself into the <lb/>
interests of her acquaintances and friends. She <lb/>
went on frequent visits, and it was while staying <lb/>
in Surrey on one occasion that she found herself <lb/>
in the midst of a colony of aristocratic French <lb/>
refugees.</p>
<p>They were all very delightful people, and one <lb/>
of them, the frank, soldierly General D'Arblay, <lb/>
found the little literary lady who sympathised so <lb/>
warmly with the wrongs of his royal master, Louis XVI., <lb/>
especially charming. He gave her French lessons; <lb/>
and she, after describing the attractions and <lb/>
"extraordinary intellect" of Madame de Sta&euml;l, <lb/>
the leader of the little colony, adds, "M. D'Arblay <lb/>
is one of the most delightful characters I have <lb/>
ever met, for openness, probity, intellectual <reg orig="know-|ledge">knowledge</reg>, <lb/>
and unhackneyed manners."</p>
<p>M. D'Arblay had, of course, lost all his property; <lb/>
and Miss Burney possessed only the magnificent <lb/>
royal pension of &pound;100 a year; but, undeterred <lb/>
by these hard facts, they were married in 1793, <lb/>
and entered upon the happiest period of Fanny's <lb/>
life.</p>
<p>Want of money led to her taking up her pen <lb/>
once more. Her third novel, <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi>, though <lb/>
not such a popular success as the two first, <lb/>
brought her in a large sum. A child was born <lb/>
to her in 1795, and then Madame D'Arblay, on <lb/>
visiting France with husband and son during the <lb/>
<pb n="192" entity="b000514724_0229"/>
peace of 1801, found herself suddenly cut off for <lb/>
ten years from her own land by the outbreak of <lb/>
the second Napoleonic war. At the end of that <lb/>
time she was about to sail for Newfoundland with <lb/>
her son, in order to save the latter, a lad of <lb/>
seventeen, from conscription; when to her delight <lb/>
their vessel was taken by the English, and she <lb/>
found herself once more upon her native shore. <lb/>
Her last and least notable work, <hi rend="italic">The Wanderer,</hi> <lb/>
was completed in this interval; and after that she <lb/>
wrote no more for the public.</p>
<p>Her long life lasted until 1840, during which <lb/>
time she outlived both husband and son, so that <lb/>
her last days were spent in comparative loneliness, <lb/>
in the midst of a period which scarcely remembered <lb/>
or had never known the brilliant wit and caustic <lb/>
humour of <hi rend="italic">Evelina</hi>.</p>
<p>Yet now and again she was sought out by <lb/>
those whose names were greater than her own <lb/>
had ever been. Sir Walter Scott records with <lb/>
evident pleasure an introduction to "Madame <lb/>
D'Arblay, the celebrated authoress of <hi rend="italic">Evelina</hi> <lb/>
and <hi rend="italic">Cecilia</hi>,&mdash;an elderly lady with no remains of <lb/>
personal beauty, but with a simple and gentle <lb/>
manner, pleasing expression of countenance, and <lb/>
apparently quick feelings. She told me she had <lb/>
wished to see two persons&mdash;myself, of course, being <lb/>
one; the other, George Canning. This was really <lb/>
a compliment to be pleased with."</p>
<p>But for the majority of the world of readers and <lb/>
writers Madame D'Arblay died many years before <lb/>
her actual end. New fashions, other codes of <lb/>
<pb n="193" entity="b000514724_0230"/>
manners, had pushed <hi rend="italic">Evelina</hi> into obscurity; <lb/>
and it has been left for these days to drag her <lb/>
forth again into the light of day, with all her <lb/>
bravery of wit and humour and delightful portraits <lb/>
of eighteenth-century life.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Few</hi> institutions during the first half of the <lb/>
nineteenth century were in such need of <lb/>
radical reform as the arrangements for women <lb/>
convicts in prison. The philanthropist John <lb/>
Howard had done much to improve the condition <lb/>
of the men in like circumstances, but about the <lb/>
year 1813, when Mrs. Fry first visited Newgate, <lb/>
the state of things in the women's wards of the <lb/>
prison was about as bad as it could be.</p>
<p>To begin with, there was no difference whatever <lb/>
made in the lot of the tried and the untried; <lb/>
hence many innocent girls and women were <lb/>
obliged to associate, until the fact of their <lb/>
innocence was established, with women criminals <lb/>
of the most abandoned class.</p>
<p>Crowded together into four small rooms, with <lb/>
nothing to do all day, without any superintendence <lb/>
save that of a gaoler and his son, they naturally <lb/>
became within a short time more like animals than <lb/>
<pb n="196" entity="b000514724_0235"/>
human beings. For the large proportion of them <lb/>
gloried in every kind of wickedness, and had lost <lb/>
all shreds of self-respect. This is no wonder, <lb/>
indeed; for they were given no clothes, although <lb/>
their rags scarcely covered them; they had no beds, <lb/>
but slept herded together on the floor like sheep in <lb/>
a pen. There was only the most scanty provision <lb/>
made for cooking and washing; and most terrible <lb/>
of all, they were allowed, and indeed encouraged, by <lb/>
the gaolers to spend the money they obtained <lb/>
through begging from the strangers who came out <lb/>
of curiosity to visit them, on strong liquor, which <lb/>
was sold by their superintendents in the prison <lb/>
itself.</p>
<p>Wild with drink, steeped in vice, and often half <lb/>
mad with misery and bodily sickness, the wretched <lb/>
women spent the day and much of the night in <lb/>
fighting, swearing, and shrieking, so that their <lb/>
ward became notorious for its horrors, and the <lb/>
governor of Newgate himself was afraid to venture <lb/>
among them.</p>
<p>What was more terrible yet was the fact that a <lb/>
large proportion of the occupants of that dreadful <lb/>
abode was made up of children of all ages, who <lb/>
were allowed to be with their mothers, and who <lb/>
grew up in the very midst of this hot-bed of misery <lb/>
and crime. What chance had they of leading <lb/>
decent lives when they were dismissed from the <lb/>
prison? What chance, indeed, had any of those <lb/>
wretched women, however slight their offence had <lb/>
been, who had passed any length of time within <lb/>
those walls?</p>
<pb n="197" entity="b000514724_0236"/>
<p>But now let us see what influences went to the <lb/>
making of the brave woman whose life-work was to <lb/>
alter all this. Elizabeth Gurney was born in 1780 <lb/>
of a staunch old Quaker family, and spent most of <lb/>
her young days amid the high elms and picturesque <lb/>
walks of Earlham Hall, near Norwich.</p>
<p>She seems to have been a singularly timid child, <lb/>
dreading to be left alone in the dark, and so afraid <lb/>
of making mistakes that her teachers put her down <lb/>
as stupid and unintelligent in the schoolroom. The <lb/>
loss of a dearly loved mother when she was twelve <lb/>
years old left her to grow up a morbid, introspective <lb/>
girl, in spite of the wholesome "give and take" <lb/>
generally found in a large family. Mr. Gurney was <lb/>
by no means a strict Quaker, and encouraged his <lb/>
eleven children in merriment and cheerful amusements. <lb/>
Dances were often held at the Hall, and there were <lb/>
frequent visits paid to Norwich for the sake of the <lb/>
excellent music for which that town is famous.</p>
<p>Elizabeth entered keenly into all such diversions. <lb/>
She was by nature both emotional and sensitive. <lb/>
Music made her at times, she says, "almost beside <lb/>
herself"; but she was subject to violent reactions of <lb/>
feeling, in which she seems to have been very <lb/>
uneasy as to the effect all such enjoyments had <lb/>
upon her.</p>
<p>Religion, in those days, was a hard taskmaster <lb/>
to Elizabeth Gurney. She seems to have found in <lb/>
it no joy, no sweetness. She shrank from the <lb/>
silence and self-discipline of the "Meeting," and yet <lb/>
was ill at ease at the concert or the ball. Much of <lb/>
this morbid feeling was due no doubt to the fact <lb/>
<pb n="198" entity="b000514724_0237"/>
that she had never as yet found the secret of <lb/>
religion&mdash;her mind rebelled against what to her were <lb/>
unnatural though constraining rules of life, and her <lb/>
heart had never been touched. Much also may be <lb/>
traced to the delicacy which haunted her girlish <lb/>
days, and evidently led to an unbalanced and <lb/>
unhealthy frame of mind.</p>
<p>Just after her seventeenth birthday, for example, <lb/>
she writes in her diary, "It is a great comfort to me <lb/>
that life is short and soon passes way; yet it is <lb/>
certainly a blessing to exist. I think I have now <lb/>
no reason to wish to die, I am so well; but I must <lb/>
own, with ill-health such as I used to have, life is a <lb/>
burden."</p>
<p>One feels inclined nowadays to prescribe a <lb/>
wholesome course of hard work, mental or physical, <lb/>
for such a state of mind; but in those times long <lb/>
hours of leisure, or days filled only with the most <lb/>
trivial household duties, were the rule; and hence <lb/>
a large amount of "world-weariness" became the <lb/>
fashion among the maidens who were introspective <lb/>
enough to keep a diary at all. She herself seems to <lb/>
have been conscious of the need of some absorbing <lb/>
interest in life.</p>
<p>"I am now seventeen," she writes, "and if some <lb/>
kind and great circumstance does not happen to me, <lb/>
I shall have my talents devoured by moth and rust. <lb/>
They will lose their brightness, lose their virtue, <lb/>
and one day they will prove a curse instead of <lb/>
a blessing. Dreaded day! I must use extreme <lb/>
exertion to act really right, to avoid idleness and <lb/>
dissipation."</p>
<pb n="199" entity="b000514724_0238"/>
<p>Fortunately for her, the awakening soon <lb/>
came.</p>
<p>A certain William Savery, a "strict Friend," <lb/>
visited Norwich and held a kind of Mission there. <lb/>
He was much shocked by the "marks of wealth <lb/>
and grandeur, which," he writes, "are too evident <lb/>
in several families of Friends in this place," <lb/>
and he doubted much if the "younger branches" <lb/>
could be induced to "choose the simple safe path <lb/>
of self-denial."</p>
<p>Elizabeth gaily attired, and wearing, as her <lb/>
sister noted with amusement, a pair of purple <lb/>
boots laced with scarlet, attended the meeting <lb/>
held by William Savery. Her heart was touched <lb/>
by his simple, direct words. "She wept," says <lb/>
her sister, "and became a good deal agitated." <lb/>
The next day the preacher came to Earlham <lb/>
Hall, and singling her out from her brothers and <lb/>
sisters, he prophesied that she "should be one who <lb/>
should bind up the broken-hearted, proclaim liberty <lb/>
to the captives and the opening of the prison to <lb/>
them that are bound."</p>
<p>"From that day her love of pleasure and of <lb/>
the world seemed gone."</p>
<p>These are again her sister's words, and they <lb/>
only serve to show how seldom the human heart is <lb/>
understood by those nearest and dearest to it.</p>
<p>For during the next two years Elizabeth's <lb/>
journals betray a constant strife between the <lb/>
natural desires of a girl of her age for enjoyment <lb/>
and amusement and the feeling that she should <lb/>
deny herself all such in preparation for the unknown <lb/>
<pb n="200" entity="b000514724_0239"/>
work to which she was called. Moreover, she was <lb/>
much troubled by the knowledge of the annoyance <lb/>
and misunderstanding which the adoption of any <lb/>
very strict rule of life would cause her family. And <lb/>
still her physical cowardice and lack of <reg orig="self-|confidence">self-confidence</reg> <lb/>
remained unaltered, and augured ill <lb/>
for the undertaking of any important mission in <lb/>
life.</p>
<p>One tiny bit of work was begun, however, though <lb/>
still with hesitation. "I have still some thought," <lb/>
she writes, "of having several poor children to <lb/>
read in the Testament and religious books for <lb/>
an hour on Sunday evening. I have begun with <lb/>
Billy, but I hope to continue and increase one by <lb/>
one. I should think it a good plan; but I must <lb/>
not even begin that hastily."</p>
<p>Commencing with one small boy, Elizabeth <lb/>
gathered together in time a considerable class&mdash;a little <lb/>
school, in fact&mdash;of seventy children, who met in an <lb/>
empty laundry, and were taught entirely by her. <lb/>
It seems very probable that here, in the control of a <lb/>
large number of mischievous, restless little beings of <lb/>
all ages, she first found the self-reliance and power <lb/>
of managing herself and others which were absolutely <lb/>
necessary for the accomplishment of her future <lb/>
work. It was about a year after her "conversion" <lb/>
that Elizabeth threw in her lot definitely with <lb/>
the "plain Quakers," by adopting the white cap <lb/>
and folded neckerchief, as well as the "thee and <lb/>
thou" of their mode of address. Within another <lb/>
year she was married to Joseph Fry.</p>
<p>The change from the regular occupation of <lb/>
<pb n="201" entity="b000514724_0240"/>
teaching her little flock at Earlham to the somewhat <lb/>
unsettled state of the first year of married life in <lb/>
London came hard to the young wife. Her mind <lb/>
was naturally somewhat slow and contemplative, <lb/>
and the state of "bustle," as she calls it, of visiting <lb/>
and being visited, and the mixing with society which <lb/>
Mr. Fry's position as partner in a large firm involved, <lb/>
was an evident worry to her. Perhaps the <reg orig="re-|membrance">remembrance</reg> <lb/>
of that call to a high work was always <lb/>
with her, and beside that mysterious and unknown <lb/>
vocation all else seemed trivial.</p>
<p>But other and more intimate interests soon <lb/>
claimed her attention. In the pretty country <lb/>
house at Plashet to which they moved in 1809 <lb/>
a large family of sons and daughters began to <lb/>
grow up around her, but they by no means absorbed <lb/>
all her time and care. The poor and ignorant Irish <lb/>
settlers in the place, the wandering gipsies who <lb/>
sometimes pitched their tent at her gates, all knew <lb/>
of her benevolence and exertions on their behalf. <lb/>
But this was not the occasion of the call.</p>
<p>In 1812 she thought she heard the voice more <lb/>
clearly. It seemed as though her duty as a Quaker <lb/>
bade her leave her family, much against her will, <lb/>
to undertake a round of visits to the various <lb/>
meeting-houses of the Friends, to preach and exhort <lb/>
those who attended them. It was while she was <lb/>
upon this mission that she met and conversed <lb/>
with four Quakers who had just come from visiting <lb/>
some prisoners in Newgate who were about to be <reg orig="exe-|cuted">executed</reg>. <lb/>
With horror in their voices, they described the <lb/>
scenes they had witnessed in the women's quarters <lb/>
<pb n="202" entity="b000514724_0241"/>
of the prison. And thus the call came, clear and <lb/>
distinct, to the life-work of Elizabeth Fry.</p>
<p>It was no easy task for a nervous, highly-strung, <lb/>
emotional woman to contemplate with equanimity. <lb/>
Before her first visit to Newgate, in company with <lb/>
one other lady, they were warned to remove the <lb/>
watches they wore, lest they should be snatched from <lb/>
them by the viragoes. But she never hesitated.</p>
<p>"The sorrowful and neglected condition of these <lb/>
depraved women and their miserable children, <lb/>
dwelling in such a vortex of corruption," writes her <lb/>
daughter, "deeply sank into her heart, although at <lb/>
this time nothing more was done than to supply the <lb/>
most destitute with clothes."</p>
<p>Four years, indeed, she had to wait for her real <lb/>
beginnings of reform. The cares of her large family <lb/>
of children, money troubles, ill-health, all kept <lb/>
her fully occupied. But when the time came she <lb/>
was ready with a well matured plan. In 1817 she <lb/>
revisited Newgate, and at her urgent request was <lb/>
left alone with the women for some hours. Her <lb/>
experience may be told in the words of one who <lb/>
heard it from her own lips. "The railing was <lb/>
crowded with half-naked women, struggling together <lb/>
for the front situations with the most boisterous <lb/>
violence and begging with the utmost vociferation. <lb/>
She felt as if she were going into a den of wild <lb/>
beasts; and she well recollects quite shuddering <lb/>
when the door closed upon her and she was locked <lb/>
in with such a herd of novel and desperate <lb/>
companions."</p>
<p>But over these wild and passionate hearts <lb/>
<pb n="203" entity="b000514724_0242"/>
Elizabeth Fry at once began to exercise a <reg orig="marvel-|lous">marvellous</reg> <lb/>
influence. Gathering them round her, she read <lb/>
to them the parable of the Lord in the vineyard, <lb/>
reminding them that even they, the poor souls <lb/>
called at the eleventh hour, had yet a full share of <lb/>
His love and mercy, if they would but hear Him. <lb/>
And then she at once began to explain her plan of <lb/>
setting up a school within the prison for their <lb/>
unhappy children, who were growing up with the <lb/>
taint of sin upon them.</p>
<p>"She desired them to consider the plan, for <lb/>
without their steady co-operation she would not <lb/>
undertake it; leaving it to them to select a <lb/>
governess from amongst themselves."</p>
<p>An empty cell was given her as schoolroom, and <lb/>
there, when first opened, came not only the children, <lb/>
but their mothers, "earnestly entreating to be <lb/>
admitted."</p>
<p>So, working through their love for their little <lb/>
ones, Mrs. Fry began gradually to give them back <lb/>
the self-respect for want of which they were sinking <lb/>
so fast into the abyss of sin and misery.</p>
<p>In that same year her unwearying exertions formed <lb/>
a little Association for the Improvement of Female <lb/>
Prisoners in Newgate, which provided for the <lb/>
clothing, teaching, and employment of the women, <lb/>
"and to form in them, as much as possible, those <lb/>
habits of order, sobriety, and industry which may <lb/>
render them docile and peaceable whilst in prison, <lb/>
and respectable when they leave it."</p>
<p>Next year a still larger work began to occupy her <lb/>
attention. Those were the days of transportation <lb/>
<pb n="204" entity="b000514724_0243"/>
to New South Wales, and the transit of a new <lb/>
batch of prisoners from the prison to the docks <lb/>
was always a scene of disgraceful rioting and <lb/>
drunkenness.</p>
<p>When this, with difficulty, was put a stop to, it <lb/>
was found to be of very little use to train the women <lb/>
in quiet and decent habits whilst in prison or on the <lb/>
convict ship, if on their arrival they were practically <lb/>
deserted, without clothes, shelter, or other protection. <lb/>
Arrangements for the alteration of this <reg orig="mismanage-|ment">mismanagement</reg> <lb/>
took no little time and pains to accomplish; <lb/>
and then the brave woman, though much worried <lb/>
by private concerns, set to work to get the law <lb/>
altered by which men, women, and children were <lb/>
hanged for such petty offences as stealing a sheep or <lb/>
a fowl.</p>
<p>Nor was it only with the prison that she concerned <lb/>
herself. The opening of a House of Refuge for <lb/>
discharged prisoners and of a Reformatory for the <lb/>
poor little sin-hardened girls of the London streets <lb/>
were among her chief interests at one time, before <lb/>
she gave herself up entirely to the arduous work of <lb/>
Inspector of Prisons.</p>
<p>In order to compare the different systems of <lb/>
punishment, Mrs. Fry visited several European <lb/>
countries, and brought back to England suggestions <lb/>
of reform which were promptly adopted by those <lb/>
whom she had at length stirred up to a sense of the <lb/>
responsibility of their position.</p>
<p>During all this time, however, she by no means <lb/>
neglected her family ties. Sometimes she laid <lb/>
aside her public duties for years together, when her <lb/>
<pb n="205" entity="b000514724_0244"/>
own ill-health and that of her dear ones summoned <lb/>
her to rest or change of work.</p>
<p>But in 1841, when she was sixty-one years of age, <lb/>
she was still actively engaged in her life-work, and <lb/>
visited in that year the prisons of most of the chief <lb/>
towns of the Continent.</p>
<p>Everywhere she went she did not hesitate to <lb/>
suggest reforms and improvements; so that not only <lb/>
the prisoners of England, but also of Europe, might <lb/>
well rise up and call her blessed.</p>
<p>The last days of this single-minded woman were <lb/>
full of sadness. Within a few weeks she lost her <lb/>
favourite sister, her beloved son, and two <reg orig="grand-|children">grandchildren</reg>. <lb/>
"Can our mother hear this and live?" was <lb/>
the awestruck question of her remaining children; <lb/>
and the shock was in truth a terrible one.</p>
<p>Still, however, she kept a brave heart, knowing <lb/>
that ere long "she would be summoned to join the <lb/>
band that was mustering so strongly on the other <lb/>
side of Jordan." One great joy was hers. "She <lb/>
had the happiness of knowing that Newgate, <lb/>
Bridewell, and all the other great London prisons <lb/>
were now in a state of comparative order; some <lb/>
exceedingly well arranged."</p>
<p>But the years of strenuous labour had worn her <lb/>
out before her time. She died very peacefully in <lb/>
the year 1845, in the midst of her family, not <lb/>
forgotten by that larger band of children, outcasts of <lb/>
society though they were, whom she had tended <lb/>
with a true mother's care.</p>
<p>She had never been of a commanding personality, <lb/>
nor had she great gifts of persuasion and eloquence, <lb/>
<pb n="206" entity="b000514724_0245"/>
so that one might perhaps wonder what really was <lb/>
the secret of her power over the wayward and <lb/>
unruly of this earth. A strong sense of her divine <lb/>
mission no doubt went far to inspire her with the <lb/>
strength of will and self-confidence which were <lb/>
certainly not natural to her. But her real secret of <lb/>
influence was her trust in and love for these <reg orig="un-|fortunates">unfortunates</reg>. <lb/>
Even the most hardened criminal would <lb/>
break down before her kindly touch and encouraging <lb/>
word. "I trust I shall hear better things of thee," <lb/>
was her strongest form of reproof; and it stirred up <lb/>
a determination to do well which effected more <lb/>
than any legal measures for the improvement of the <lb/>
prisoners.</p>
<p>When we look back at her wayward, difficult <lb/>
girlhood, her indecisions and scruples, and compare <lb/>
it with the splendid fruition of her womanhood, we can <lb/>
but feel that she was pre-eminently one who "being <lb/>
called unto a good work, perfected it unto the end."</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">There</hi> stands one amongst our group of <lb/>
famous women to whom, though she appears <lb/>
to shrink into the background in an effort to escape <lb/>
our notice, the highest honours given to literary <lb/>
women are rightly due. For Jane Austen was <lb/>
more than a mere writer of fiction, a teller of <lb/>
pleasant tales. She had the rare gift of making <lb/>
what is commonplace interesting, and of reading <lb/>
human nature with such keen observation that she <lb/>
could paint the ordinary everyday person in such <lb/>
a way as to show him in a new and <reg orig="extra-|ordinary">extraordinary</reg> <lb/>
light. No human being was "commonplace" <lb/>
to her, and hence her characters are the most <lb/>
living in the world. Everyone who has read <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Pride and Prejudice</hi> feels he has made of "Mrs. <lb/>
Bennett" a lifelong friend&mdash;to be laughed at, <lb/>
indeed, but never to be forgotten; and all who <lb/>
have any knowledge of the life of a small country <lb/>
town have made the acquaintance of "Miss <lb/>
Bates."</p>
<p>The life of Jane Austen is as quiet as the <lb/>
<pb n="208" entity="b000514724_0249"/>
atmosphere of her books. She was born in a <lb/>
comfortable country vicarage in 1775, the youngest <lb/>
of a family of five sons and two daughters. Her <lb/>
father was vicar of the little Hampshire village of <lb/>
Steventon, and here she passed the first twenty-five <lb/>
years of her life amid commonplace scenery and <lb/>
commonplace surroundings. If scenery has that <lb/>
influence on character with which it is generally <lb/>
credited, we cannot fail to see the quiet, comfortable, <lb/>
well-to-do country parish in every line of her <lb/>
writings, just as we breathe <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l rend="indent">"the breath of the moors fresh blown</l>
<l>O'er leagues of clover and cold grey stone"</l>
</lg></q>
in the pages of the Bront&euml;s.</p>
<p>Perhaps if she had possessed a very vivid <lb/>
imagination, the tameness of her surroundings <lb/>
would have driven her to wild realms of fancy <lb/>
and "faery lands forlorn." But Jane's faculty of <lb/>
observation was her strongest point, and this led her <lb/>
instead to the more difficult if less attractive <lb/>
task of weaving her stories from the material <lb/>
that lay at her very doors. Many a girl would <lb/>
have found her existence dull to the last degree. <lb/>
But fortunately for us, as well as for herself, <lb/>
Jane possessed the gift of humour, said to be <lb/>
so rare among women, which has the power <lb/>
of turning grey to silver, and of fetching sparks out <lb/>
of the most impenetrable of flints.</p>
<p>The Austen family, though not wealthy, was <lb/>
quite "comfortable," as they would say in the country <lb/>
districts, and like most clergymen of good birth, <lb/>
<pb n="209" entity="b000514724_0250"/>
Mr. Austen was accustomed to mix with all <lb/>
the society that was to be found in and around <lb/>
Steventon. Both he and his wife were unusually <lb/>
well-educated people, and thus the large family <lb/>
of children grew up in a cultured atmosphere, <lb/>
full of the clever talk and merry jest that make <lb/>
home-life so delightful.</p>
<p>From the first the chief devotion of little <lb/>
Jane, the "baby" of the family, was given to her <lb/>
sister Cassandra, nearly four years her senior.</p>
<p>"If Cassandra were going to have her head <lb/>
cut off, Jane would insist on sharing her fate," <lb/>
her mother would say, with a laugh. And sure <lb/>
enough, when the day came for the elder girl to <lb/>
set off for boarding-school, Jane worked herself <lb/>
into such a passion of misery that there was <lb/>
nothing for it but to send her too.</p>
<p>Throughout their lives this devotion remained. <lb/>
Their letters to one another might have been <lb/>
those between two lovers, so full they are of the <lb/>
warmest, most enthusiastic affection; and nothing <lb/>
was ever published by Jane till it had first been <lb/>
read to Cassandra and discussed with her. The <lb/>
days of boarding-school were few, however.</p>
<p>The two girls were educated almost entirely <lb/>
at home, and no better than most women of <lb/>
that age, though Jane was a good French scholar <lb/>
and could read Italian. She was a great reader, <lb/>
however, though her critical taste was scarcely <lb/>
to be commended; for while Crabbe, Cowper, <lb/>
Johnson, and Scott were her favourite poets, she <lb/>
put Crabbe far above the rest&mdash;possibly because <lb/>
<pb n="210" entity="b000514724_0251"/>
in powers of observation and of drawing <reg orig="clear-|cut">clearcut</reg> <lb/>
pictures of ordinary life they were much akin. <lb/>
She tells us that she always hated "solid reading," <lb/>
and indeed one of her chief delights in girlhood <lb/>
was in needlework or anything that required deft <lb/>
fingers to accomplish; but her frequent mention of <lb/>
new books shows that she was by no means the <lb/>
"ignorant and uninformed" person she would, in her <lb/>
modesty, have us believe.</p>
<p>When she was quite a child her love for writing <lb/>
was strongly developed. Later on she seems <lb/>
to have wished she had "written less and read <lb/>
more" before she was sixteen; but no doubt her <lb/>
"scribbling" served as an excellent apprenticeship <lb/>
to her future work. A play called <hi rend="italic">The Mystery,</hi> <lb/>
written when she was about twelve years old, <lb/>
still exists, and shows at any rate a touch of the <lb/>
humour and swift though unobtrusive action to <lb/>
be found in the novels. But the characters are <lb/>
caricatures, and thus very different from the finished <lb/>
portraits of her riper years.</p>
<p>Five years later another attempt was made in <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Lady Susan</hi>, a story told in letters, which was <lb/>
thrown aside by her as unworthy of notice by <lb/>
anyone save the members of her own family. <lb/>
And then Jane grew up, and laid aside her pen for <lb/>
a while to take her place in the social world of <lb/>
Steventon as the "younger Miss Austen."</p>
<p>According to her portrait at this period, she <lb/>
was a pretty, curly-haired girl, with a singularly <lb/>
bright face, laughing eyes, and merry lips. Most <lb/>
of her brothers were married by this time, and <lb/>
<pb n="211" entity="b000514724_0252"/>
Jane herself was much admired at the county <lb/>
balls and country dances; but she seems to have <lb/>
laughed at love-making with that utter lack of <lb/>
sentimentality which we find again and again <lb/>
in her novels. Of one very persistent lover she <lb/>
writes to her sister, "He has but one fault, which <lb/>
time will, I trust, entirely remove&mdash;it is that his <lb/>
morning coat is a great deal too light." And <lb/>
again: "I rather expect to receive an offer from <lb/>
my friend in the course of the evening. I shall <lb/>
refuse him, however, unless he promises to give <lb/>
away his white coat." Other suitors pressed her <lb/>
hard, but Jane's heart remained safely in her <lb/>
own keeping. Once and once only does it seem <lb/>
to have been really touched, and then the affair <lb/>
was treated with such reticence that none save <lb/>
Cassandra knew of it.</p>
<p>It was a brief romance indeed. A young <lb/>
clergyman fell deeply in love with her during <lb/>
a seaside visit to Devon. Nothing definite was <lb/>
said, but on their departure he urgently desired <lb/>
that he might visit them, and to this Jane, to <lb/>
her sister's surprise, agreed. Before anything could <lb/>
be arranged as to the meeting, he died quite <lb/>
suddenly; and as Jane never mentioned him to <lb/>
anyone save her sister, nothing was thought of <lb/>
it at the time. But the brief and tragic little <lb/>
romance accounts probably for the fact that <lb/>
the brilliant and popular girl remained unmarried <lb/>
to the end of her life.</p>
<p>After her first few months of "Society," Jane <lb/>
returned to her desk with renewed vigour. She did <lb/>
<pb n="212" entity="b000514724_0253"/>
not make of her writing a serious occupation, <lb/>
and never mentions it in her long letters to her <lb/>
sister. She did not even carry it on in a separate <lb/>
room, but sat in the vicarage sitting-room, where <lb/>
all the family came in and out at their will, and <lb/>
where visitors were frequent and welcome.</p>
<p>Thus <hi rend="italic">Pride and Prejudice</hi>, finished when she <lb/>
was one-and-twenty, was written in the very midst <lb/>
of family and social life; but she carefully concealed <lb/>
the fact of her writing from the outer world, who, <lb/>
if they caught her at her little mahogany desk, <lb/>
thought no doubt that she was making up the <lb/>
accounts for the clothing club or writing out a <lb/>
recipe for gooseberry wine.</p>
<p>When her first book was finished, her father <lb/>
wrote to ask Mr. Cadell the publisher if he would <lb/>
undertake it at the author's expense. But alas <lb/>
for girlish hopes! The great man would not even <lb/>
look at the manuscript, which unluckily had not <lb/>
been sent him at first. Fortunately, she did not <lb/>
give up writing in consequence of this rebuff, <lb/>
though she had even less time than usual to give <lb/>
to it. In 1801 Mr. Austen gave up his work <lb/>
at Steventon, and on Jane, the daughter most <lb/>
often at home, fell the duty of arranging the <lb/>
move and of settling her parents in their new <lb/>
home at Bath.</p>
<p>The "city of invalids" was no very cheerful <lb/>
abiding - place for a lively young woman, and <lb/>
though she managed to get a great deal of fun <lb/>
out of her neighbours, she was clearly bored by <lb/>
their tame frivolities. She managed to finish <lb/>
<pb n="213" entity="b000514724_0254"/>
<hi rend="italic">Northanger Abbey</hi>, however, and even to dispose <lb/>
of it to a local bookseller and publisher for the <lb/>
magnificent sum of ten pounds. But there it ended; <lb/>
for the worthy tradesman made no attempt to <reg orig="pub-|lish">publish</reg> <lb/>
it, and the careful work and frequent polishing <lb/>
Jane had bestowed upon it seemed utterly wasted.</p>
<p>Then her father died, and Mrs. Austen with her <lb/>
two daughters moved to Southampton. This was <lb/>
a barren period; the four years they spent there <lb/>
were uncongenial to all, and when one of the sons <lb/>
offered his mother and sisters a home at Chawton <lb/>
Cottage, a pleasant house on his Hampshire estate, <lb/>
they gladly accepted it. Once more Jane was <lb/>
among her own people, in a house large enough <lb/>
to receive any of the family who could visit them, <lb/>
including a number of the nephews and nieces to <lb/>
whom "Aunt Jane" was a never failing source of <lb/>
delight and interest. One of these last wrote of <lb/>
her after her death:&mdash;</p>
<p>"As a very little girl, I was always creeping after <lb/>
Aunt Jane, in the house and out of it. Her first <lb/>
charm to children was great sweetness of manner. <lb/>
She seemed to love you, and you loved her in <lb/>
return. This was what I felt in my early days, <lb/>
before I was old enough to be amused by her <lb/>
cleverness. But soon came the delight of her <lb/>
playful talk; she could make everything amusing <lb/>
to a child."</p>
<p>One likes to think of her so completely happy <lb/>
in that home-life which was to be, after all, so <lb/>
very brief, and to know that at length her ready <lb/>
pen was to gain some measure of reward for the <lb/>
<pb n="214" entity="b000514724_0255"/>
work to which it now returned. It was not until <lb/>
she was thirty-six years of age that <hi rend="italic">Sense and <lb/>
Sensibility</hi> was published, but it at once became <lb/>
a brilliant success. Characteristically enough, her <lb/>
only remark when she received one hundred and <lb/>
fifty pounds for it was that it was a great deal to <lb/>
earn with so little trouble.</p>
<p>The ease, indeed, with which she wrote her long <lb/>
novels, with their minute study of character, is only <lb/>
less wonderful than her absolute unselfconsciousness <lb/>
and humility. But she was naturally deeply <reg orig="in-|terested">interested</reg> <lb/>
in the fate of her "brain-children." In <lb/>
1813, <hi rend="italic">Pride and Prejudice</hi>, her first and finest <lb/>
work, which had been scornfully rejected on its <reg orig="pre-|vious">previous</reg> <lb/>
attempt to win a way for itself, was published.</p>
<p>"I feel that I must write to you to-day," she tells <lb/>
her sister a few days after its publication. "I want <lb/>
to tell you that I have got my own darling child <lb/>
from London." Then she goes on to describe how <lb/>
her mother read it aloud to an unsuspecting <reg orig="neigh-|bour">neighbour</reg>, <lb/>
who "really does seem to admire Elizabeth." <lb/>
"I must confess," she writes anent the charming <lb/>
heroine of that book, "I think her as delightful a <lb/>
creature as ever appeared in print, and how I shall <lb/>
be able to tolerate those who do not like <hi rend="italic">her</hi> at <lb/>
least, I do not know. &hellip; Now I will try and <lb/>
write of something else."</p>
<p>Within the next four years appeared <hi rend="italic">Mansfield <lb/>
Park, Emma, Persuasion</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Northanger Abbey</hi>, <lb/>
the last rescued from the short-sighted publisher <lb/>
of Bath. The first three all show Miss Austen <lb/>
at her best; for if they lack the <hi rend="italic">verve</hi> and brilliant <lb/>
<pb n="215" entity="b000514724_0256"/>
wit of <hi rend="italic">Pride and Prejudice</hi>, they are more marked <lb/>
by ease and maturity of style, and especially by <lb/>
her increased power of painting character. <hi rend="italic">Emma</hi> <lb/>
is perhaps the finest of all, though Jane herself <lb/>
was so convinced of its future unpopularity that <lb/>
she said of her chief character, "I am going to <lb/>
take a heroine whom no one but myself will <lb/>
much like."</p>
<p>However that might be, it was <hi rend="italic">Emma</hi> that won <lb/>
for her from the Prince Regent, the future George IV., <lb/>
the unexpected compliment of an invitation to <lb/>
view his library at Carlton House, as a gracious <lb/>
intimation that she might dedicate her next work <lb/>
to him. His librarian indeed went further, and <lb/>
after modestly requesting that she would make <lb/>
him the hero of her next novel, suggested that <lb/>
"an historical romance, illustrative of the august <lb/>
House of Coburg, would just now be very <lb/>
interesting."</p>
<p>We can imagine how Miss Austen's eyes would <lb/>
twinkle as she answered with strained politeness, <lb/>
"I am fully sensible that an historical romance <lb/>
founded on the House of Saxe-Coburg might be <lb/>
much more to the purpose of profit and popularity <lb/>
than such pictures of domestic life in country villages <lb/>
as I deal in. But I could no more write a romance <lb/>
than an epic poem. I could not sit seriously <lb/>
down to write a serious romance under any other <lb/>
motive than to save my life; and if it were <reg orig="in-|dispensable">indispensable</reg> <lb/>
for me to keep it up, and never relax <lb/>
into laughing at myself or at other people, I am <lb/>
sure I should be hung before I had finished the <lb/>
<pb n="216" entity="b000514724_0257"/>
first chapter. No, I must keep to my own style <lb/>
and go on in my own way; and though I may <lb/>
never succeed again in that, I am convinced that <lb/>
I should totally fail in any other."</p>
<p>The publication of <hi rend="italic">Emma</hi> had very sad <reg orig="associa-|tions">associations</reg> <lb/>
for its author. While she was staying with <lb/>
her brother Henry in town, in order to see it through <lb/>
the press, the latter became alarmingly ill, and lay <lb/>
for weeks at death's door. The terrible strain and <lb/>
anxiety of this illness told very heavily on Jane's <lb/>
health and nerves; and scarcely had Henry begun <lb/>
to recover, when by the breaking of a bank the <lb/>
whole Austen family found themselves involved <lb/>
in heavy money losses. Perhaps the years of <lb/>
uneventful happiness had been a bad preparation <lb/>
for the sudden batch of troubles. Her health and <lb/>
spirits began to fail steadily, though before the <lb/>
members of her own family she still wore an <lb/>
appearance of cheerfulness that deceived them as <lb/>
to her true condition.</p>
<p>But still, though unable to walk or drive at all, <lb/>
or even to sit upright without discomfort, she <reg orig="con-|tinued">continued</reg> <lb/>
to write, finishing her last novel, <hi rend="italic">Persuasion</hi>, <lb/>
as usual, in the midst of her family, though obliged <lb/>
to lie stretched out on chairs, since the one sofa of <lb/>
the little drawing-room was always dedicated to the <lb/>
use of her aged mother.</p>
<p>In the beginning of 1817 her strength seemed <lb/>
in some measure to return, and she began a new <lb/>
novel. But the flame of life was only flickering <lb/>
before it was extinguished altogether. Her sister <lb/>
took her to Winchester, in the vain hope of medical <lb/>
<pb n="217" entity="b000514724_0258"/>
aid; and from thence she writes to her nieces in <lb/>
her usual tender, half-mocking style, assuring them <lb/>
of the love and care with which she is surrounded. <lb/>
She died in July 1817, in the midst of her growing <lb/>
fame, when she was but forty-two, and was buried <lb/>
in the beautiful Cathedral she had always so much <lb/>
admired.</p>
<p>The touching letters written by her relations after <lb/>
her death show that to them the great charm of <lb/>
Jane's life lay in her bright, sweet, unselfish nature. <lb/>
Her brothers and sister never realised, probably, <lb/>
how really great, in her own line, were her <reg orig="achieve-|ments">achievements</reg>. <lb/>
"A woman first, a writer afterwards," that <lb/>
was her aim in life, and she certainly succeeded in <lb/>
living up to it.</p>
<p>But to the reading public there came at length <lb/>
some real appreciation of her work. Sir Walter <lb/>
Scott's words are well known, but they afford such <lb/>
an excellent summary of her best points that we <lb/>
quote them in conclusion. He writes in his <lb/>
Journal: "Read again for the third time at least <lb/>
Miss Austen's finely written novel of <hi rend="italic">Pride and <lb/>
Prejudice</hi>. That young lady had a talent for <lb/>
describing the involvements and feelings and <lb/>
characters of ordinary life which is to me the <lb/>
most wonderful I ever met with. The big <reg orig="Bow-|Wow">Bow-Wow</reg> <lb/>
strain I can do myself like anyone now <lb/>
going; but the exquisite touch which renders ordinary <lb/>
commonplace things and characters interesting from <lb/>
the truth of the description and the sentiment is <lb/>
denied to me. What a pity such a gifted creature <lb/>
died so early!"</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">This</hi> little maiden, whose sensitive soul shrank <lb/>
from injuring a butterfly, grew up to be one <lb/>
of the simplest and yet one of the grandest characters <lb/>
in our gallery of noble women. Her brother, for <lb/>
poetical reasons, calls her "Emmeline" here, but <lb/>
her real name was Dorothy, true "gift of God" to <lb/>
that same poet-brother. For William Wordsworth, <lb/>
in many respects the greatest of our modern poets, <lb/>
tells us plainly more than once of the huge debt <lb/>
he owed to this younger sister; and we may even <lb/>
go so far as to say that much of his beautiful, <lb/>
thoughtful work would never have been accomplished <lb/>
if it had not been for the ideal kept before him and <lb/>
the encouragement given him by her.</p>
<p>Dorothy Wordsworth was born in 1771, two years <lb/>
<pb n="220" entity="b000514724_0263"/>
after her brother, and soon developed into an eager, <lb/>
sensitive little maiden, never quite happy unless she <lb/>
were running wild on the fells round Cockermouth, <lb/>
learning lessons from the wise old lips of Mother <lb/>
Nature herself. When she was six years old her <lb/>
mother died, and the children&mdash;four boys and one <lb/>
girl&mdash;were scattered. Her favourite brother, William, <lb/>
went to live in the quaint old market town of <lb/>
Hawkshead, in order to attend the grammar-school, <lb/>
and Dorothy was brought up by some cousins at <lb/>
Halifax.</p>
<p>For thirteen years she lived in this smoky, ugly <lb/>
town, without a chance of seeing the beloved <reg orig="school-|boy">schoolboy</reg> <lb/>
brother; but the memory of the Cumberland <lb/>
fells and lakes was strong within her, and it was <lb/>
with a sense of recovering lost years that she, a <lb/>
girl of nineteen, found herself once more in their <lb/>
midst, together with William, at that time an <lb/>
undergraduate at Cambridge. Then it was that <lb/>
the elder brother discovered the girl's rare <reg orig="under-|standing">understanding</reg> <lb/>
and appreciation of Nature&mdash;a gift which <lb/>
from that period made her his most precious <lb/>
companion.</p>
<p>At this time, however, she was little more than <lb/>
that; but, as we shall see, a time was to come when <lb/>
Dorothy became in a very special way the guardian <lb/>
of William's intellect and genius; when her sweet <lb/>
and womanly character formed for him an ideal <lb/>
which had much to do with turning his thought <lb/>
into certain directions and making him one of our <lb/>
greatest thinkers and poets. To her his earliest <lb/>
poems, some of which were no doubt inspired <lb/>
<pb n="221" entity="b000514724_0264"/>
during the long delightful wanderings of this <lb/>
holiday, were dedicated.</p>
<p>During the next four years William spent much <lb/>
of his time in France, and Dorothy saw but little <lb/>
of him.</p>
<p>It was the day of the French Revolution, and <lb/>
Wordsworth was among those ardent spirits who, <lb/>
when the movement first began, thought it was <lb/>
going to bring about a vast improvement, moral, <lb/>
physical, and intellectual, for the unhappy and <reg orig="down-|trodden">downtrodden</reg> <lb/>
peasants of all countries. The freedom of <lb/>
Nature was to be theirs, when once the existing <lb/>
state of things was done away, and all men were <lb/>
to live in peace together on equal terms of <reg orig="brother-|hood">brotherhood</reg>. <lb/>
Instead of the fulfilment of this fair dream, <lb/>
he saw the beginning of the awful Reign of Terror, <lb/>
and heard <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l rend="indent">"a voice that cried</l>
<l>To the whole city "Sleep no more!"</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>So he returned home, a disappointed, disillusioned <lb/>
man, much inclined to think that because the <lb/>
Republic had proved to be a failure the whole wide <lb/>
world was "out of joint."</p>
<p>Fortunately, it was to the wise and tender <lb/>
sympathy of Dorothy that he first turned. Together <lb/>
they made long excursions on foot. "I walked," <lb/>
she writes in one of her letters, "with my brother <lb/>
at my side, from Kendal to Grasmere, eighteen <lb/>
miles, and afterwards from Grasmere to Keswick, <lb/>
fifteen miles, through the most delightful country <lb/>
that was ever seen. We are now at a farmhouse <lb/>
<pb n="222" entity="b000514724_0265"/>
about half a mile from Keswick. When I came I <lb/>
intended to stay only a few days; but the country <lb/>
is so delightful, and above all I have so full an <lb/>
enjoyment of my brother's company, that I have <lb/>
determined to stay a few weeks longer."</p>
<p>The months that followed were full of anxiety <lb/>
for Dorothy. Her beloved brother was still restless <lb/>
and disturbed in mind; as he says himself, it was <lb/>
a time when <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l rend="indent">"the fretful stir</l>
<l>Unprofitable and the fever of the world</l>
<l>Have hung upon the beatings of my heart."</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>He could not decide what should be his work <lb/>
in life, and yet it was imperative that he should <lb/>
earn money to provide for even the simple wants <lb/>
of his sister and himself. He had written very <lb/>
little poetry, and had made no mark as a poet; <lb/>
but Dorothy was more certain of his true vocation <lb/>
than he himself seems to have been, and her eager <lb/>
encouragement kept him true to this high ideal. <lb/>
Just at this time, too, in 1794, the bequest of one <lb/>
of the few outside friends who believed in his <lb/>
genius enabled him to put aside the pressing need <lb/>
of obtaining more lucrative employment, and to <lb/>
enjoy leisure for thought and study of Nature.</p>
<p>It was a tiny income on which the two were to <lb/>
live, but they cared nothing for that. It gave them <lb/>
a home&mdash;"the first home I ever had," she calls it&mdash; <lb/>
at Racedown, in Dorsetshire; and there William <lb/>
wrote and thought and read his poetry aloud, while <lb/>
Dorothy studied Italian, managed the house, and <lb/>
<pb n="223" entity="b000514724_0266"/>
watched over her brother with jealous care. <lb/>
Gradually the troubled period of the Revolution <lb/>
ceased to affect the poet; and it was Dorothy who <lb/>
brought his feet back to the paths of peace, by <lb/>
showing him it was by a truer return to Nature <lb/>
than that of the Revolution, which would best <lb/>
solve the problems of the world.</p>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"She gave me eyes, she gave me ears,</l>
<l>And humble cares, and delicate fears,</l>
<l>A heart, the fountain of sweet tears,</l>
<l>And love, and thought, and joy."</l>
</lg></q>
<p>At Racedown they first made the acquaintance <lb/>
of one who was to become a lifelong friend. "You <lb/>
had a great loss," Dorothy writes to a friend, "in not <lb/>
seeing Coleridge. He is a wonderful man. His <lb/>
conversation teems with soul, mind, and spirit. Then <lb/>
he is so benevolent, so good-tempered and cheerful, <lb/>
and like William, interests himself so much about <lb/>
every trifle. At first I thought him very plain&mdash; <lb/>
that is, for about three minutes. He is pale, thin, <lb/>
has a wide mouth, thick lips and not very good <lb/>
teeth, longish, loose-growing, half-curling rough <lb/>
black hair. But if you hear him speak for five <lb/>
minutes you think no more of them. His eye is <lb/>
large and full, and not very dark but grey: it <lb/>
speaks every emotion of his animated mind. &hellip; <lb/>
The first thing that was read after he came was <lb/>
William's new poem, the <hi rend="italic">Ruined Cottage,</hi> with <lb/>
which he was much delighted."</p>
<p>Such close friends did the three become that <lb/>
in 1797 the Wordsworths went to live at Alfoxden, <lb/>
<pb n="224" entity="b000514724_0267"/>
in Somersetshire, in order to be nearer the home <lb/>
of Coleridge. Dorothy's description of the country <lb/>
shows that the remembrance of her beloved Lake <lb/>
Country is still strong in her mind. "There is <lb/>
everything here; sea, woods wild as fancy ever <lb/>
painted, brooks clear and pebbly as in Cumberland, <lb/>
villages so romantic; and William and I, in a wander <lb/>
by ourselves, found out a sequestered waterfall, in a <lb/>
dell formed by steep hills covered with full-grown <lb/>
timber trees. The country has the character of the <lb/>
less grand parts of the neighbourhood of the Lakes."</p>
<p>In this quiet home a happy, uneventful year <lb/>
was passed &mdash; uneventful, that is, as far as the <lb/>
world of physical action is concerned, but not as <lb/>
regards the larger world of poetry and thought. <lb/>
For it was during an autumn walk along the <reg orig="sea-|coast">seacoast</reg> <lb/>
from Minehead to Lynmouth that the two <lb/>
poets planned the lay of the <hi rend="italic">Ancient Mariner</hi>, <lb/>
reciting it as they walked in the cloudy November <lb/>
afternoon to the responsive and enthusiastic <lb/>
Dorothy. This was the germ of the <hi rend="italic">Lyrical <lb/>
Ballads</hi>, which has ever since been famous as the <lb/>
first work of the two poets. Before the collection <lb/>
was complete, it included the <hi rend="italic">Lines written above <lb/>
Tintern Abbey,</hi> in which William openly pays tribute <lb/>
to all that his sister had done for him during his <lb/>
troubled years:&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l rend="indent">"Nor, perchance,</l>
<l>If I were not thus taught, should I the more</l>
<l>Suffer my genial spirits to decay;</l>
<l>For thou art with me, here upon the banks</l>
<l>Of this fair river, thou my dearest friend,</l>
<l>My dear, dear friend; and in thy voice I catch</l>
<pb n="225" entity="b000514724_0268"/>
<l>The language of my former heart, and read</l>
<l>My former pleasure in the shooting lights</l>
<l>Of thy wild eyes. Oh! yet a little while</l>
<l>May I behold in thee what I was once,</l>
<l>My dear, dear sister! &hellip; Therefore let the moon</l>
<l>Shine on thee in thy solitary walk;</l>
<l>And let the misty mountain winds be free</l>
<l>To blow against thee; and in after years,</l>
<l>When these wild ecstasies shall be matured</l>
<l>Into a sober pleasure, when thy mind</l>
<l>Shall be a mansion for all lovely forms,</l>
<l>Thy memory be as a dwelling-place</l>
<l>For all sweet sounds and harmonies; oh! then</l>
<l>If solitude, or fear, or pain, or grief</l>
<l>Should be thy portion, with what healing thoughts</l>
<l>Of tender joy wilt thou remember me."</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>Here the influence of Dorothy in keeping him <lb/>
true to his early love of Nature is clearly seen. <lb/>
Many of his poems of this period, too, are a poetical <lb/>
version of their discussions and of the events of <lb/>
their daily life. Hence it was she who not only <lb/>
restored to him his ideal, but also kept his home <lb/>
so peaceful and free from petty cares that he was <lb/>
able to expand in thought and fancy, and so fulfil <lb/>
his high calling.</p>
<p>Much encouragement was needed also; for <lb/>
Wordsworth was still to remain for twenty years <lb/>
one who was "the scoff of the world, his poetry <lb/>
a by-word for scorn"; and it was perhaps to <lb/>
soften the disappointment caused by the chilly <lb/>
reception of the <hi rend="italic">Lyrical Ballads</hi> that the brother <lb/>
and sister travelled to Germany and stayed there <lb/>
for a year. But neither the climate nor the <lb/>
philosophy of Germany was congenial, and they <lb/>
hastened back at the end of a year, Dorothy to <lb/>
<pb n="226" entity="b000514724_0269"/>
stay with old friends, the Hutchinson family, at <lb/>
Penrith, while William set off with Coleridge for a <lb/>
tour of the Lake District.</p>
<p>Years before, in one of his earliest poems, <lb/>
Wordsworth had spoken of a spot, <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"Where peace to Grasmere's lonely island leads,</l>
<l>To willowy hedgerows and to emerald meads,</l>
<l>Leads to her bridge, rude church, and cottaged grounds,</l>
<l>Her rocky sheep walks and her woodland bounds."</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>It was therefore in the lovely vale of Grasmere, <lb/>
nestling under the broad shoulder of Helvellyn, <lb/>
that he now found a tiny house, well named Dove <lb/>
Cottage, which was to be their peaceful refuge for <lb/>
many years.</p>
<p>It stood on the roadside, looking upon the <lb/>
"lonely island" of the lake, with a sloping and <lb/>
rocky garden and orchard behind. Thither the <lb/>
brother and sister walked on foot to take possession <lb/>
some twenty-one miles on the shortest day of <lb/>
the year, passing with glad hearts through the <lb/>
frosty roads and snowy woods to the warm little <lb/>
nest where so many fine ideas were to be thought <lb/>
out and so much beautiful poetry written.</p>
<p>It was during the happy months after their <lb/>
arrival that Wordsworth tells us once more what <lb/>
his sister had been to him:&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l rend="indent">"Mine eyes did ne'er</l>
<l>Fix on a lovely object, nor my mind</l>
<l>Take pleasure in the midst of happy thoughts,</l>
<l>But either she, whom now I have, who now</l>
<l>Divides with me that loved abode, was there,</l>
<l>Or not far off. Where'er my footsteps turned</l>
<pb n="227" entity="b000514724_0270"/>
<l>Her voice was like a hidden bird that sang;</l>
<l>The thought of her was like a flash of light,</l>
<l>Or an unseen companionship, a breath</l>
<l>Of fragrance independent of the wind."</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>Moreover, she was of real practical help in his <lb/>
work. Hers were often the vivid, telling descriptions <lb/>
of a beggar-woman or a little maiden's talk to <lb/>
her pet lamb, which gave the poet the material <lb/>
for his poetry. Her description of the daffodils, <lb/>
seen by them on a walk to Gowbarrow Park, near <lb/>
Ullswater, gave him the very words for one of <lb/>
his loveliest poems:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I never saw daffodils so beautiful. They <lb/>
grew among the mossy stones; some rested their <lb/>
heads on these stones as on a pillow; the rest <lb/>
tossed and reeled and danced, and seemed as if they <lb/>
verily laughed with the wind, they looked so gay <lb/>
and glancing."</p>
<p>To those whose life is passed in the midst of <lb/>
noise and unrest, who rush from one exciting <lb/>
amusement to another, or the conditions of whose <lb/>
work forbids the vision of <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l rend="indent">"that inward eye</l>
<l>Which is the bliss of solitude,"</l>
</lg></q>
the quiet happiness and joy experienced by <lb/>
Dorothy Wordsworth, in her uneventful life and <lb/>
tranquil surroundings, must be perfectly <reg orig="incom-|prehensible">incomprehensible</reg>. <lb/>
Her mind was a gallery of beautiful <lb/>
pictures, whereas the minds of many people are <lb/>
rather like a cinematograph, with its hurrying, <lb/>
worrying bustle and change of scene.</p>
<pb n="228" entity="b000514724_0271"/>
<p>Here is one of her pictures, painted in words <lb/>
by her, after a quiet evening's walk:&mdash;"The Lake <lb/>
of Grasmere beautiful; the church an image of <lb/>
peace; the mountains indistinct: the lake calm <lb/>
and partly ruffled; a sweet sound of water <lb/>
falling into the quiet lake. A storm gathering in <lb/>
Easedale, so we returned; but the moon came out, <lb/>
and opened to us the church and village. Helm Crag <lb/>
in shade; the larger mountains dappled like a sky."</p>
<p>Wordsworth's marriage in 1802 with Mary <lb/>
Hutchinson, whom he describes so perfectly in the <lb/>
poem "She was a phantom of delight," served only <lb/>
to draw the three closer together. Mary was a <lb/>
gentle soul, all peace and serenity, ready to smooth <lb/>
away the rough places in the path of her beloved <lb/>
husband, while Dorothy, eager and enthusiastic, <lb/>
was always on ahead, beckoning him to higher <lb/>
flights of fancy. Mary loved to keep the nest <lb/>
warm at Dove Cottage, and to watch over "Baby <lb/>
John," while Dorothy walked long miles with her <lb/>
brother and Coleridge in a delightful expedition <lb/>
to Scotland, of which her Journal gives a vivid <lb/>
description. The frugal nature of the little <reg orig="house-|hold">household</reg> <lb/>
is shown in one or two charmingly graphic <lb/>
touches. Thus Dorothy writes: "On our return, we <lb/>
found Mary in perfect health &hellip; and little John <lb/>
asleep in the <hi rend="italic">clothes-basket by the fire</hi>."</p>
<p>The description given by De Quincey, one of our <lb/>
finest English prose-writers, makes us almost see <lb/>
the very scene he paints.</p>
<p>"I was ushered," he says, "up a little flight of <lb/>
stairs &hellip; to a little drawing-room, or rather '<reg orig="half-|kitchen">half-kitchen</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="229" entity="b000514724_0272"/>
and half-parlour,' as Wordsworth himself <lb/>
describes it. It was not fully seven feet six inches <lb/>
high; &hellip; there was, however, in a small recess, a <lb/>
library of perhaps three hundred volumes which <lb/>
seemed to consecrate the room as the poet's study <lb/>
and composing room, and such occasionally it was. <lb/>
&hellip; The tea-hour with the Wordsworths was the <lb/>
most delightful meal in the day; just as dinner is in <lb/>
great cities and for the same reason&mdash;because it was <lb/>
prolonged into a meal of leisure and conversation. <lb/>
&hellip; In the morning &hellip; I found Miss <reg orig="Words-|worth">Wordsworth</reg> <lb/>
making breakfast in the little sitting-room. <lb/>
No urn was there, no glittering breakfast service; <lb/>
a kettle boiled upon the fire; I rarely had seen so <lb/>
humble a <hi rend="italic">m&eacute;nage</hi>. On the third morning after my <lb/>
arrival, I found the whole family, except the two <lb/>
children, prepared for the expedition across the <lb/>
mountains. I had heard of no horses &hellip; but at <lb/>
the moment of starting, a cart&mdash;the common farmer's <lb/>
cart of the country&mdash;made its appearance, and the <lb/>
driver was a bonny young woman of the vale. &hellip; <lb/>
Our style of travelling occasioned no astonishment; <lb/>
on the contrary, we met a smiling salutation <reg orig="where-|ever">where-ever</reg> <lb/>
we appeared."</p>
<p>Some years after his marriage, the poet removed <lb/>
to larger quarters at Rydal Mount, between <reg orig="Gras-|mere">Grasmere</reg> <lb/>
and Ambleside, and here Dorothy's days <lb/>
became busier still; for Wordsworth was composing <lb/>
the long poem of the <hi rend="italic">Excursion</hi> and others by <lb/>
no means brief, and as he much disliked the <lb/>
labour of writing, his sister became his willing <lb/>
pen-woman.</p>
<pb n="230" entity="b000514724_0273"/>
<p>But Dorothy's eager nature wore out her physical <lb/>
powers before her time. For the last twenty-five <lb/>
years of her life she was a confirmed invalid, and <lb/>
she whose feet had passed so lightly over her <lb/>
beloved mountains never left her couch. "She is <lb/>
very feeble," writes her brother, "and never quits <lb/>
her room. She does not suffer much pain, and is <lb/>
very cheerful; and nothing troubles her but the <lb/>
sense of requiring so much attention." He tells <lb/>
also of a robin which, of his own free will, made his <lb/>
permanent home in her room, perching at night on <lb/>
a nail in the wall, and flapping his tiny wings as <lb/>
though to fan her face.</p>
<p>Though her joyous days of vigorous strength and <lb/>
delight in Nature were over, she still rejoiced in the <lb/>
remembrance of the past, and loved to recall it to <lb/>
her brother's mind. In spite of her long illness, <lb/>
she survived the poet nearly five years, dying in <lb/>
January 1855, at the age of eighty-three. In <lb/>
that hallowed spot of earth beneath the yew tree <lb/>
of Grasmere Churchyard, under the shade of the <lb/>
old grey tower, she sleeps by her brother's side, <lb/>
while their well - loved river Rotha sings their <lb/>
requiem.</p>
<p>"What a dull, uneventful life!" some will say; <lb/>
and others will wonder why, with her strong poetic <lb/>
instinct, she did not write poetry herself and <lb/>
become famous in the world of letters.</p>
<p>But the sisterly devotion which was the <reg orig="main-|spring">mainspring</reg> <lb/>
of her life was to Dorothy a far higher <lb/>
ideal than either fame or the joy of creation. <lb/>
We are told that the absent-minded poet would <lb/>
<pb n="231" entity="b000514724_0274"/>
sometimes, when miles from home, be seized with <lb/>
a sudden inspiration and write some charming <lb/>
fragment of verse on a stone by the wayside <lb/>
with a bit of slate refuse for his pen; then striding <lb/>
on ahead would be lost again in his world of <lb/>
fancy. And Dorothy's self - appointed task was <lb/>
to lift the heavy stone and carry it home, toiling <lb/>
in the wake of her brother's footsteps, but more <lb/>
than happy in her lot.</p>
<p>The incident is a parable of her whole life. <lb/>
She found her joy in William's fame, her happiness <lb/>
in the fact that she was always his closest confidante, <lb/>
his inspiration, in the highest sense his "<reg orig="help-|meet">help-meet</reg>."</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> name of Somerville College, Oxford, is <lb/>
familiar enough to girls of the present day, <lb/>
some of whom have perhaps found the delights of <lb/>
higher education within its walls; but not many, <lb/>
even of these, know much of the struggle for <lb/>
knowledge which beset the life-work of the <reg orig="dis-|tinguished">distinguished</reg> <lb/>
woman who gives that College its <lb/>
name.</p>
<p>Mary Fairfax was born in the year 1780, and <lb/>
passed most of her early life in the little Scotch <lb/>
seaport town of Burntisland, just opposite Edinburgh, <lb/>
on the coast of Fife. A delightful home was <lb/>
hers&mdash;a long, old-fashioned house, with a great <lb/>
walled garden stretching down to a plot of short <lb/>
grass covering a ledge of black, sea-washed rocks. <lb/>
What better playground could there be for a <lb/>
lonely little maid who never cared for dolls, but <lb/>
who, from very early years, was keenly interested in <lb/>
all living, moving objects of Nature!</p>
<p>Birds were her chief delight. One of her <lb/>
earliest recollections is of watching the strings of <lb/>
wild geese pass across the grey autumn skies <lb/>
<pb n="234" entity="b000514724_0279"/>
with their curious whistling rustle, and of her <lb/>
amusement at seeing the clumsy tame fat geese <lb/>
which were feeding on the Links rise in a body <lb/>
and try to follow them. And her first real grief <lb/>
was caused by the death of a pet mountain sparrow, <lb/>
who was her constant companion, sitting on <lb/>
her shoulder, pecking at her book, and eating out <lb/>
of her mouth.</p>
<p>Her mother taught her to read the Bible and <lb/>
to say her prayers, but as far as other education <lb/>
was concerned she was allowed "to grow up a <lb/>
wild creature." But she learnt to be useful in <lb/>
the dairy, to feed the poultry, and to pick the <lb/>
fruit for preserving; and it was on one of these <lb/>
last occasions that her first unpremeditated lesson <lb/>
in experimental science was received.</p>
<p>She had filled a number of bottles with green <lb/>
gooseberries, which her mother bade her take to <lb/>
the cook and bid her boil the bottles uncorked, <lb/>
till the fruit was sufficiently cooked. Either Mary <lb/>
or the servant forgot the latter part of the message, <lb/>
for presently all the house was alarmed by a <lb/>
series of loud explosions and terrific screams. The <lb/>
bottles had been corked before they were boiled, <lb/>
and of course the pressure of the expanding gas <lb/>
within had exploded the bottles.</p>
<p>Mary's next step in education took place when <lb/>
she was made to learn the Catechism of the Scottish <lb/>
Kirk and to attend the public examinations <reg orig="there-|upon">thereupon</reg>. <lb/>
She dreaded these ordeals, which were <lb/>
attended by all the children in the place, together <lb/>
with their mothers and a large number of very <lb/>
<pb n="235" entity="b000514724_0280"/>
critical old women. Mary was very shy and nervous, <lb/>
and understood not a word of the mystic formula <lb/>
which she was forced to learn by heart; so she <lb/>
acquitted herself shockingly. This fact was laid <lb/>
before her sailor-father when he returned from one <lb/>
of his long voyages. An informal examination was <lb/>
held; and the unfortunate Mary, unable to write, <lb/>
and only able to read <hi rend="italic">Robinson Crusoe</hi> and the <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Pilgrim's Progress</hi> with a strong Scotch accent, was <lb/>
openly condemned. For some weeks she had to <lb/>
stumble tearfully over a paper of the <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi> aloud <lb/>
to her father every morning after breakfast. It <lb/>
meant less than nothing to the child, who spelt it <lb/>
out in stupefied fashion, only regaining her natural <lb/>
brightness when she was allowed to shut the <lb/>
hated book and "go and help father in the <lb/>
garden."</p>
<p>Then at length the decree went forth: "This <lb/>
kind of life will never do; Mary must at least know <lb/>
how to write and keep accounts." So the ten-<reg orig="year-|old">year-old</reg> <lb/>
child was sent to Miss Primrose's boarding-school <lb/>
at Musselburgh, where real troubles began to cross <lb/>
her path. The restraint of regular hours and much <lb/>
schoolroom-life was hard to bear after the breezy <lb/>
garden and the wave-swept rocks of Burntisland; <lb/>
but it was not the worst.</p>
<p>"A few days after my arrival," she tells us in her <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Recollections</hi>, "although perfectly straight and <reg orig="well-|made">well-made</reg>, <lb/>
I was enclosed in stiff stays with a steel busk <lb/>
in front, while above my frock bands drew my <lb/>
shoulders back till the blades met. Then a steel <lb/>
rod, with a semicircle which went under the chin, <lb/>
<pb n="236" entity="b000514724_0281"/>
was clasped to the steel busk. In this constrained <lb/>
state I had to prepare my lessons."</p>
<p>And then what an education for a child of quick <lb/>
observation and eager, restless, inquiring mind! <lb/>
"The chief thing I had to do was to learn by heart <lb/>
a page of Johnson's Dictionary, not only to spell the <lb/>
words, give their parts of speech and meaning, but, <lb/>
as an exercise of memory, to remember their order <lb/>
of succession. Besides, I had to learn the first <lb/>
principles of writing and the rudiments of French <lb/>
and English grammar."</p>
<p>At the end of a year Mary's education was <lb/>
supposed to be complete. School was expensive, <lb/>
and her parents seem to have expected a very <lb/>
complete and striking amount of knowledge in <lb/>
return for the money spent on her. But it was <lb/>
soon found that Mary could not compose or write <lb/>
an ordinary letter and that her spelling was wild in <lb/>
the extreme. She was reproached, unfairly enough, <lb/>
with waste of time. "My mother said she would <lb/>
have been contented if I had only learnt to write <lb/>
well and keep accounts, which was all that a woman <lb/>
was expected to know."</p>
<p>The only wonder is that Mary ever wanted to <lb/>
look at a book again, with such associations as <lb/>
these. And at first, in her newly recovered freedom, <lb/>
she gladly exchanged Johnson's Dictionary for the <lb/>
far more delightful and ever open Book of Nature.</p>
<p>"When the tide was out," she says, "I spent <lb/>
hours on the sands, looking at the starfish and <reg orig="sea-|urchins">sea-urchins</reg>, <lb/>
or watching the children digging for <reg orig="sand-|eels">sand-eels</reg>, <lb/>
cockles, and the spouting razor-fish. I made <lb/>
<pb n="237" entity="b000514724_0282"/>
a collection of shells, such as were cast ashore, some <lb/>
so small that they appeared like white specks in <lb/>
patches of black sand. There was a small pier for <lb/>
shipping limestone brought from the coal-mines <lb/>
inland. I was astonished to see the surface of <lb/>
these blocks of stone covered with beautiful <lb/>
impressions of what seemed to be leaves. How <lb/>
they got there I could not imagine, but I picked <lb/>
up the broken bits and brought them to my <reg orig="reposi-|tory">repository</reg>. <lb/>
I knew the eggs of many birds, and made a <lb/>
collection of them."</p>
<p>So the small beginnings of scientific study were <lb/>
made. Nothing seems to have escaped the <lb/>
observant young eyes. At the bottom of the <lb/>
garden were to be found at low tide masses of <lb/>
rock covered with sea-weeds, and although she did <lb/>
not know the names she could distinguish a large <lb/>
number of the different species. There were no <lb/>
wild flowers in that sandy spot, but farther along <lb/>
the coast was a wood through which flowed a little <lb/>
"burn," the banks of which were covered with ferns, <lb/>
foxgloves, or primroses in their season; and these <lb/>
were a great delight to the child.</p>
<p>But when the long cold winter set in, with snow <lb/>
or rain, Mary "did not know what to do with herself." <lb/>
She hated sewing, much to the horror of good Aunt <lb/>
Janet, who, finding her poring over the pages of <lb/>
Shakespeare, her one unfailing source of delight <lb/>
indoors, said to her mother, "I wonder you let <lb/>
Mary waste her time in reading; she never sews <lb/>
more than if she were a man!"</p>
<p>So a rigorous course of plain needlework was <lb/>
<pb n="238" entity="b000514724_0283"/>
prescribed, in which she became an unwilling expert. <lb/>
Far more interesting were the lessons in the "use <lb/>
of the globes" from the village schoolmaster.</p>
<p>"My bedroom," she says, "had a window to the <lb/>
south, and a small closet near had one to the north. <lb/>
At these I spent many hours, studying the stars <lb/>
by the aid of a celestial globe. Although I watched <lb/>
and admired the magnificent displays of the Aurora, <lb/>
which frequently occurred, they seemed to be so <lb/>
nearly allied to lightning that I was somewhat <lb/>
afraid of them. At an earlier period of my life <lb/>
there was a comet, which I dreaded exceedingly."</p>
<p>When Mary was thirteen, a long stay in <reg orig="Edin-|burgh">Edinburgh</reg> <lb/>
was made the opportunity for giving her <lb/>
writing and music lessons, and on her return to <lb/>
Burntisland the thirst for knowledge seems to have <lb/>
definitely awaked. She taught herself enough Latin <lb/>
to read C&aelig;sar, and that year, for the first time in <lb/>
her life, met with sympathetic encouragement from <lb/>
her uncle, Dr. Somerville, in her lonely quest. <lb/>
When on a visit to his house, she told him with <lb/>
much shyness that she had been trying to learn <lb/>
Latin, but she feared in vain, since her brother, so <lb/>
superior to her in brains and with every assistance, <lb/>
spent years in learning it. Her uncle told her <lb/>
not to despair, and promised to read Virgil with <lb/>
her for an hour or two every morning before <reg orig="break-|fast">breakfast</reg>, <lb/>
"which," says she, "I gladly did."</p>
<p>The crowning touch was put on Mary's education, <lb/>
as far as her parents were concerned, by sending <lb/>
her to a dancing-school during a visit to another <lb/>
uncle at Edinburgh; and she gives an amusing <lb/>
<pb n="239" entity="b000514724_0284"/>
picture of the tall, thin dancing-master, bewigged <lb/>
and beruffled, with his "kit" under his arm and <lb/>
his invariable question during the "deportment" <lb/>
lesson&mdash;"Now, if the Queen were to ask you to <lb/>
eat a bit of mutton with her, what would you <lb/>
say?"</p>
<p>But it was on her return to Burntisland that the <lb/>
girl first came across in most unexpected fashion <lb/>
what was to be the great study of her life.</p>
<p>She was asked out to a friend's house to look at <lb/>
some fancy-work, and when this had been discussed <lb/>
she was shown an illustrated Book of Fashions, <lb/>
with coloured plates of ladies' dresses, charades, and <lb/>
puzzles. At the end of a page she found what <lb/>
appeared to be an ordinary problem in arithmetic, <lb/>
but on turning it over she saw "strange-looking lines <lb/>
mixed with letters, chiefly x's and y's," and asked, <lb/>
"What is that?" "Oh," said her friend, "it is a <lb/>
kind of arithmetic: they call it algebra, but I know <lb/>
nothing about it."</p>
<p>With that keen scent for new knowledge which <lb/>
is so conspicuously absent from our present-day <lb/>
girls, with their ample <hi rend="italic">menu</hi> of mental food, Mary <lb/>
turned over the books at home to try and find <lb/>
the key to the mysterious "algebra." At first she <lb/>
thought she had come upon it in a book on <reg orig="Naviga-|tion">Navigation</reg>, <lb/>
and though this did not help her very much, <lb/>
she found something that touched on astronomy, <lb/>
of which she earnestly wished to know more. She <lb/>
dared not ask her elders, so sure was she of being <lb/>
laughed at; and so "sad and forlorn" she felt at <lb/>
her own smallness in proportion to the great <lb/>
<pb n="240" entity="b000514724_0285"/>
unknown world of knowledge, that she was tempted <lb/>
often to sink back into the life of needlework, <reg orig="piano-|playing">piano-playing</reg>, <lb/>
and petty interests for which apparently a <lb/>
girl was designed.</p>
<p>Meantime, however, she filled the long hours <lb/>
with learning Greek enough to read Xenophon, <lb/>
and gladly took lessons in painting when her <lb/>
family went to Edinburgh for the season. At last, <lb/>
however, her chance came. Her young brother's <lb/>
tutor, though no mathematician, gladly solved <lb/>
the mystery as to what was meant by "algebra," <lb/>
and also procured for her in Edinburgh a copy of <lb/>
Euclid's Elements and an algebra book. A new <lb/>
field of perfect delight was opened to the girl's <lb/>
mind. Her mother kept her busy in the daytime <lb/>
with mending and making; her piano and <lb/>
painting occupied the hours of daylight; but <lb/>
the evening and often the nights were spent in the <lb/>
curious fascination of problems and diagrams.</p>
<p>Then the servants told her mother that "it <lb/>
was no wonder the stock of candles was soon <lb/>
exhausted, for Miss Mary sat up reading till a very <lb/>
late hour." On this the order was given to take <lb/>
away her candle directly she was in bed.</p>
<p>But darkness did not put a stop to the study <lb/>
of geometry. She had already gone through the <lb/>
first six books of Euclid, and now she went <lb/>
through a certain number of propositions mentally <lb/>
each night, till she had almost completed the whole. <lb/>
Perhaps she unwisely made mention of the fact; <lb/>
for her father, discovering what was going on, <lb/>
exclaimed to his wife, "Peg, we must put a stop <lb/>
<pb n="241" entity="b000514724_0286"/>
to this, or we shall have Mary in a strait jacket <lb/>
one of these days. There was X., who went <lb/>
raving mad about the longitude!"</p>
<p>So the studies had to be kept secret; and <lb/>
meanwhile Mary, never a mere bookworm, lived a <lb/>
happy, healthy life enough, meeting many <reg orig="interest-|ing">interesting</reg> <lb/>
people during the long visits to Edinburgh. <lb/>
So many difficulties indeed were put in the way <lb/>
of more intellectual studies that she gave most <lb/>
of her time to painting, though this did not <lb/>
satisfy her eager, craving mind. "I was intensely <lb/>
ambitious to excel in something," she says at this <lb/>
time, "for I felt in my own breast that women <lb/>
were capable of taking a higher place in creation <lb/>
than that assigned to them in my early days, <lb/>
which was very low."</p>
<p>Even after she "came out" and went a good <lb/>
deal into Edinburgh society, she never lost sight <lb/>
of the main object of her life, which was to <lb/>
prosecute her studies. These were frowned on <lb/>
more than ever by her elders, so she used to <lb/>
rise at daybreak, wrap herself in a blanket&mdash;for <lb/>
the Edinburgh "season" was the coldest in the <lb/>
year&mdash;and read algebra or the classics till <lb/>
breakfast-time.</p>
<p>But these did not wholly absorb her interests. <lb/>
Poetry and stories she delighted in, and her first <lb/>
visit to the Highlands made her a warm admirer <lb/>
of the poems of Ossian. Then came the stirring <lb/>
events of the Napoleonic wars to absorb her <lb/>
interests. Her father lost money at this time, <lb/>
and they returned to a very quiet existence at <lb/>
<pb n="242" entity="b000514724_0287"/>
Burntisland, where Mary again began her heroic <lb/>
struggle for knowledge, anent which she writes <lb/>
sadly, "I had not the means of pursuing any <lb/>
one as far as I could wish, nor had I any friend <lb/>
to whom I could apply for direction or information. <lb/>
I was often deeply depressed at spending so much <lb/>
time to so little purpose."</p>
<p>In 1804 Mary Fairfax married a Mr. Samuel <lb/>
Greig, and went to live in London. She hoped now <lb/>
for more freedom in study, but unfortunately her <lb/>
husband had no sympathy with her on this point, <lb/>
or interest in science of any kind.</p>
<p>Within three years she returned to her Scottish <lb/>
home, a widow with two little boys; and it was <lb/>
during this period of quiet and leisure that she <lb/>
began undauntedly to try to read Newton's <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Principia</hi>, which she naturally found "extremely <lb/>
difficult."</p>
<p>But she had somehow made the acquaintance <lb/>
in England of a mathematical teacher named <lb/>
Wallace, who edited a scientific journal. He <lb/>
sent her copies of this, and she began to solve <lb/>
regularly the problems contained in it. Before <lb/>
long the self-taught mathematician of <reg orig="twenty-|eight">twenty-eight</reg> <lb/>
won a silver medal for a prize problem <lb/>
set in the pages of this paper.</p>
<p>Later on Mr. Wallace was elected Professor <lb/>
of Mathematics at Edinburgh University, and <lb/>
for the first time Mary found a willing and able <lb/>
guide. He suggested to her an excellent <lb/>
mathematical library, and she now began work <lb/>
in good earnest.</p>
<pb n="243" entity="b000514724_0288"/>
<p>"I could hardly believe that I possessed such <lb/>
a treasure when I looked back on the day when <lb/>
I first saw the mysterious word 'algebra' and <lb/>
the long course of years in which I had persevered <lb/>
almost without hope. It taught me never to <lb/>
despair. I had now the means, and pursued my <lb/>
studies with increased assiduity; concealment <lb/>
was no longer possible, nor was it attempted. I <lb/>
was considered eccentric and foolish, and my <lb/>
conduct was highly disapproved of, especially <lb/>
by some members of my own family."</p>
<p>In the year 1812 a new life of hopes fulfilled <lb/>
began for Mary with her marriage with Dr. <lb/>
William Somerville. His relations were very <lb/>
angry, and wrote caustic letters to her "hoping <lb/>
she would give up her foolish manner of life and <lb/>
studies, and make a respectable and useful wife." <lb/>
But Dr. and Mrs. Somerville were far too much <lb/>
in sympathy to care for shafts like these. She <lb/>
was indeed proud to disarm them by her skill <lb/>
in invalid cookery during the honeymoon <lb/>
itself.</p>
<p>They settled in Edinburgh, and soon attracted <lb/>
a circle of scientific and literary acquaintances, <lb/>
who were proud to help the clever young wife <lb/>
to unlock that fountain of scientific knowledge <lb/>
which had been sealed to her so long. Astronomy <lb/>
now became her chief interest, but in geology, <lb/>
physical geography, and many other sciences she <lb/>
quickly became so proficient as to be considered <lb/>
an authority upon them.</p>
<p>Attainment is never as interesting as the <lb/>
<pb n="244" entity="b000514724_0289"/>
struggle to attain, and we must therefore pass <lb/>
swiftly over the happy years filled with congenial <lb/>
work, with the education of her children, the <lb/>
loving assistance of her husband, and the friendship <lb/>
of such men as Herschel and Parry, the discoverers <lb/>
respectively of sky and land, to interest and <lb/>
occupy her.</p>
<p>A letter of Miss Edgeworth, who saw her <lb/>
frequently, gives a vivid description of Mary <lb/>
Somerville at this time, when she modestly <lb/>
occupied the position of the most learned scientific <lb/>
woman in Britain:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Mrs. Somerville is little, slightly made, fairish <lb/>
hair, pink colour, small grey, round, intelligent, <lb/>
smiling eyes, very pleasing countenance, remarkably <lb/>
soft voice, strong but well-bred Scotch accent; <lb/>
timid, not disqualifyingly timid, but naturally <lb/>
modest, yet with a degree of self-possession <lb/>
through it which prevents her being in the least <lb/>
awkward, and gives her all the advantage of her <lb/>
understanding, at the same time that it adds a <lb/>
prepossessing charm to her manner and takes off <lb/>
all dread of her superior scientific learning."</p>
<p>In 1827 her hands were full of work. She <lb/>
was asked to write a treatise on the "Mechanism <lb/>
of the Heavens" which would bring ignorant <lb/>
readers into touch with some of the great truths <lb/>
of science.</p>
<p>In this she was most successful, for her own <lb/>
early struggles no doubt made her long to help <lb/>
others who might be in the same case. Letters <lb/>
of congratulation were showered upon her; she <lb/>
<pb n="245" entity="b000514724_0290"/>
was elected an honorary member of the Royal <lb/>
Astronomical Society; her bust by Chantrey, the <lb/>
famous sculptor, was set up in their Hall, and the <lb/>
King granted her a pension of &pound;300 a year.</p>
<p>So the busy years went by. Delicate health <lb/>
was not allowed to interfere with work, for we <lb/>
read that when not permitted to rise, she would <lb/>
write in bed till one o'clock. All her literary <lb/>
work was done in the morning, so that the <reg orig="after-|noon">afternoon</reg> <lb/>
and evening might be devoted to the claims <lb/>
of husband, children, and friends.</p>
<p>To the end of her long life she kept herself <lb/>
fresh and interested in passing events, and her <lb/>
wonderful intellect remained unimpaired to the <lb/>
last. On the actual day of her death, in her <reg orig="ninety-|second">ninety-second</reg> <lb/>
year, she revised and completed a treatise <lb/>
on the "Theory of Differences," and rejoiced to <lb/>
find that she could understand and develop the <lb/>
most intricate and difficult formul&aelig; of science as <lb/>
easily as when she was young. In what were <lb/>
almost her last words she expressed her one regret, <lb/>
that "she should not live to see the distance of <lb/>
the earth from the sun determined by the transit <lb/>
of Venus, and the source of the most renowned <lb/>
of rivers, the discovery of which will immortalise <lb/>
the name of Dr. Livingstone."</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">High</hi> up on the moorland is built the village <lb/>
of Haworth, on the steep grey side of a <lb/>
windy hill. Greyness is indeed the chief <reg orig="character-|istic">characteristic</reg> <lb/>
of the place&mdash;grey houses, grey church, with <lb/>
grey tombstones paving the paths and forming <lb/>
the outer wall of the churchyard; and greyest <lb/>
of all is the little Parsonage, overlooking the <lb/>
churchyard on one side, and a small courtyard in <lb/>
front.</p>
<p>But all round the stony village and gloomy <lb/>
Rectory stretch great rolling sweeps of moorland, <lb/>
purple with summer heather, white with winter <lb/>
<pb n="248" entity="b000514724_0295"/>
snows, full of shadows and colours and glorious <lb/>
curves and hollows, forming a perfect playground <lb/>
for the Parsonage children.</p>
<p>Let us take our first glimpse at them in 1821, <lb/>
as they were well remembered in after days by <lb/>
the village women&mdash;six little creatures walking in <lb/>
a long line, hand in hand, the tiniest hanging on <lb/>
to the skirts of her elders up to the skyline of the <lb/>
moors, with faces turned towards the sunset. They <lb/>
were not wanted at home, for their quiet, patient <lb/>
mother was dying of cancer and homesickness <lb/>
for her Cornish land, and as long as the <lb/>
children were "good," they might go and do as <lb/>
they liked.</p>
<p>In those days of their first acquaintance with <lb/>
the Yorkshire moors, Maria, the eldest girl, was <lb/>
but seven years old; and then came, in quick <lb/>
succession, Elizabeth, Charlotte, Branwell, Emily, <lb/>
and Anne. Such babies were these four last that <lb/>
they, of course, remembered no other abode, and <lb/>
to them the wild moorland became emphatically <lb/>
their "home," from which, in Emily's case at any <lb/>
rate, it became positive agony, in later days, to <lb/>
separate herself.</p>
<p>During the long spells of wet weather, when <lb/>
the rain poured down from the moorland heights, <lb/>
they had other joys, austere indeed, but no less <lb/>
keen. A little room over the passage was <reg orig="ap-|propriated">appropriated</reg> <lb/>
to their use&mdash;no cosy nursery, but a <lb/>
fireless apartment, always known as the "children's <lb/>
study." A pathetic acquaintance with the <reg orig="pre-|vailing">prevailing</reg> <lb/>
"Hush!" of a sickroom stilled the high <lb/>
<pb n="249" entity="b000514724_0296"/>
voices or joyous laughter, and very early the <lb/>
children learnt the lesson of self-discipline.</p>
<p>"You would not have known there was a child <lb/>
in the house," says their mother's old nurse, "they <lb/>
were such still, noiseless, good little creatures. <lb/>
Maria would shut herself up in the children's <lb/>
study with a newspaper, and be able to tell one <lb/>
everything when she came out&mdash;debates in <reg orig="Parlia-|ment">Parliament</reg> <lb/>
and I don't know what all. She was as <lb/>
good as a mother to her sisters and brother. But <lb/>
there were never such good children. I used to <lb/>
think them spiritless, they were so different from <lb/>
any I had ever seen."</p>
<p>In this last conjecture the good old woman was <lb/>
altogether wrong.</p>
<p>Repressed almost from their babyhood by an <lb/>
ailing, worried mother and a father who seems to <lb/>
have alternated between aloofness and the <reg orig="treat-|ment">treatment</reg> <lb/>
of them as grown-up people, they began <lb/>
very early to live a life of their own, which was <lb/>
only very occasionally revealed to their elders. <lb/>
After their mother's death, when Maria was seven <lb/>
years old, an aunt arrived from the South to look after <lb/>
the six children. The chill of the stone floors and <lb/>
the damp moorland air filled poor Miss Branwell with <lb/>
dismay. She interfered very little with the children, <lb/>
and though she ruled the household well she spent <lb/>
most of her time in her bedroom, where, with a <lb/>
constant fire, she could enjoy some of the comforts <lb/>
of her South Country existence.</p>
<p>Mr. Bront&euml; tells us, however, that he was <reg orig="some-|times">sometimes</reg> <lb/>
drawn from the seclusion of his study by <lb/>
<pb n="250" entity="b000514724_0297"/>
the sound of high and eager voices in angry <lb/>
discussion. But it was no quarrel over a broken <lb/>
doll or a disputed share in a rocking-horse on <lb/>
which he was called to arbitrate. The little <lb/>
sisters were accustomed to write plays for their <lb/>
own acting, in which the Duke of Wellington, <lb/>
Charlotte's hero, "was sure to come off conqueror," <lb/>
and disputes were wont to arise concerning <lb/>
his superiority over Buonaparte, Hannibal, or <lb/>
C&aelig;sar.</p>
<p>In the early years of the last century so-called <lb/>
"children's books" would be quite unknown to the <lb/>
occupants of a country rectory. Hence, being <reg orig="book-|lovers">book-lovers</reg> <lb/>
from their cradles, the children devoured the <lb/>
volumes they found in their father's scanty library. <lb/>
There they would feed upon books such as <lb/>
Plutarch's Lives, Shakespeare, and certainly the <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Pilgrim's Progress</hi>, which last sent six-year-old <lb/>
Charlotte on a perilous journey to find the City <lb/>
Beautiful, only to be turned back in a fit of nervous <lb/>
terror when she reached a tree-darkened road <lb/>
which was clearly the Valley of the Shadow of <lb/>
Death.</p>
<p>The long distance, the wild country, and the <lb/>
motherless condition of the girls all tended to <lb/>
make their existence very solitary. But for this <lb/>
they cared little. They were devoted to each <lb/>
other, and perfectly satisfied with their own <reg orig="com-|panionship">companionship</reg>; <lb/>
and it must have been a sore wrench <lb/>
to them all when the parental decree went forth <lb/>
that Maria and Elizabeth, now eleven and ten years <lb/>
of age, must go to school.</p>
<pb n="251" entity="b000514724_0298"/>
<p>At Cowan's Bridge a cheap school for clergymen's <lb/>
daughters had lately been opened. Here, in six or <lb/>
seven small damp cottages, were gathered some <lb/>
seventy or eighty girls, to be fed, clothed, and <lb/>
educated for &pound;14 a year; and here the two little <lb/>
sisters were left by their father to be fitted for <lb/>
earning a livelihood in the future. Unfortunately, <lb/>
no training could have been more unsuitable to <lb/>
delicate children, accustomed to a wonder-world <lb/>
of their own, inhabited by great men and women <lb/>
and by fancies and thoughts of which their elders <lb/>
never dreamed.</p>
<p>At Cowan's Bridge all such "nonsense" was <lb/>
swept away, and a parrot - like proficiency in <lb/>
geography, grammar, and arithmetic took its place. <lb/>
Nor were their bodies better fed than their minds. <lb/>
Burnt porridge, tainted beef, sour milk, turned <lb/>
delicate appetites to nausea and loathing, and <lb/>
the girls suffered intensely from the chill that <lb/>
comes from damp and underfeeding. It must <lb/>
have been with mingled feelings of joy and <lb/>
dismay that the two elder girls were joined a <lb/>
few months later by Charlotte and Emily; for <lb/>
they found their "little mother," their quiet, clever <lb/>
Maria, changed into a despairing, suffering child, <lb/>
the butt of the school, and the especial object of <lb/>
the bullying treatment of one of the mistresses. <lb/>
Little did the latter realise that in future days <lb/>
she herself would be pilloried before the world <lb/>
by the savage pen of the small sister, who <lb/>
took her as her model for "Miss Scatcherd," while <lb/>
Maria was the "Helen Burns" of <hi rend="italic">Jane Eyre</hi>.</p>
<pb n="252" entity="b000514724_0299"/>
<p>Untidy, and forgetful of the dry facts forced <lb/>
daily upon her notice, poor Maria suffered constant <lb/>
punishment, involving loss of food as well as bodily <lb/>
pains and penalties.</p>
<p>No allowance was made for her increasing <lb/>
physical weakness, and to the horrified eyes of <lb/>
the little sisters she grew every day more thin, <lb/>
pale, and suffering. Suddenly a thunderbolt fell on <lb/>
the school. Forty girls sickened with low fever, <lb/>
brought on no doubt by underfeeding and <reg orig="de-|fective">defective</reg> <lb/>
drainage. The Bront&euml; children were <reg orig="un-|touched">untouched</reg> <lb/>
by it, but, probably through happening <lb/>
to come under the doctor's notice, Maria's condition <lb/>
began at length to alarm the authorities. Mr. <lb/>
Bront&euml; was sent for, and the child was found to be <lb/>
in the last stage of consumption. He took <lb/>
her home in the Leeds coach, which passed the <lb/>
school cottages, towards which she waved a <lb/>
thin little hand, in farewell to the clustering <lb/>
heads at the doorway. Within a week she was <lb/>
dead.</p>
<p>The next child, Elizabeth, who is only <reg orig="remem-|bered">remembered</reg> <lb/>
at Cowan's Bridge for the patience and <lb/>
silent pluck with which she endured a severe cut <lb/>
on the head, arising from a fall, next attracted <lb/>
the doctor's notice. Another sorrowful farewell <lb/>
was spoken, and Elizabeth was sent home in a <lb/>
servant's charge. Five weeks after her sister's <lb/>
death, she was laid by her side in Haworth <lb/>
Church.</p>
<p>When Charlotte and Emily returned to Haworth <lb/>
for the half-yearly vacation, it must indeed have <lb/>
<pb n="253" entity="b000514724_0300"/>
seemed that their happy home-world was gradually <lb/>
melting away from their longing gaze. Those <lb/>
midsummer holidays must have been sad enough, <lb/>
but sadder still the return to school, where, although <lb/>
better conditions of food now prevailed, the rough <lb/>
and ready treatment, both mental and physical, <lb/>
was utterly unsuited to nervous, highly-strung, <lb/>
clever children, with free, wild, passionate hearts <lb/>
hidden under their outwardly calm exteriors. Both <lb/>
began to pine and sicken; and to their great joy <lb/>
they were sent home for good in the autumn of <lb/>
that same year, 1825.</p>
<p>And now Charlotte, barely ten years old, found <lb/>
herself in the position of elder sister and mother <lb/>
to the rest. Once again the "study" resounded with <lb/>
eager voices, and busy heads bent over books and <lb/>
papers in absorbed happiness. Miss Branwell <lb/>
exacted a certain task of fine sewing from the <lb/>
three little girls. Mr. Bront&euml; when at leisure <lb/>
from parish affairs taught his son Branwell, <lb/>
a clever boy, who should have been at a good <lb/>
school, and occasionally guided the studies of his <lb/>
daughters; otherwise they were free to learn as they <lb/>
liked.</p>
<p>With some children a period of desultory work <lb/>
and idleness would have ensued. But these five <lb/>
years were some of the most strenuous in <reg orig="Char-|lotte's">Charlotte's</reg> <lb/>
life. The gift within her was already <reg orig="stir-|ring">stirring</reg>, <lb/>
and piles of treasured scraps of blank paper <lb/>
were covered by her eager pen during this period. <lb/>
It was an excellent apprenticeship to her future <lb/>
craft. Tales, poems, whole magazines, <reg orig="character-|sketches">character-sketches</reg>, <lb/>
<pb n="254" entity="b000514724_0301"/>
dramas, contemporary incidents, all these <lb/>
appear in minute handwriting about this time, <lb/>
in astonishing quantity and no less surprising <lb/>
quality. She had already grasped the fact, which <lb/>
most young authors are so slow to learn, that <lb/>
the finest preparation for future work was to <lb/>
describe exactly what she saw in her everyday <lb/>
experience, to use her own materials instead of <lb/>
those of other people at second hand.</p>
<p>But there were also unmistakable signs of a <lb/>
vivid and glowing imagination. As with many <lb/>
other fanciful and original children, a game of <lb/>
"Islands," peopled by heroes of history or <reg orig="bio-|graphy">biography</reg>, <lb/>
played a prominent part in their <reg orig="amuse-|ments">amusements</reg>; <lb/>
and Charlotte describes with remarkable <lb/>
exactness the contour, arrangement, and government <lb/>
of these purely imaginary spots. A modern girl <lb/>
would have strained after publication, and competed <lb/>
for prizes in girls' magazines. The Bront&euml; children <lb/>
hugged their writings to themselves in delicious <lb/>
secrecy; not even their father had any idea of <lb/>
their favourite amusement.</p>
<p>In 1831, Charlotte, now nearly fifteen, was still <lb/>
short and slight, with very small hands and feet, <lb/>
a tiny head crowned with a quantity of soft brown <lb/>
hair, a large nose, and quick glancing eyes like a <lb/>
bird's. And now it seems to have dawned upon <lb/>
her father that a year's schooling before she was <lb/>
nine years old was all the formal education given <lb/>
as yet to this clever child of his.</p>
<p>So Charlotte went to school again, at Roe Head, <lb/>
some twenty miles away; appearing there "very <lb/>
<pb n="255" entity="b000514724_0302"/>
cold and miserable, short-sighted, shy and nervous." <lb/>
She soon won for herself a position in the school, <lb/>
which was a very different institution from Cowan's <lb/>
Bridge.</p>
<p>At first the girls were astonished at her <reg orig="ignor-|ance">ignorance</reg>, <lb/>
for she "had never learnt grammar at all, <lb/>
and knew very little geography." But to their <lb/>
amazement she not only knew the contents of <lb/>
their poetry-books by heart, but could tell them <lb/>
all about the authors and what else they had <lb/>
written. She soon proved herself a magnificent <lb/>
weaver of stories, and on one occasion these <lb/>
became so thrilling, after the lights were turned <lb/>
off and the girls were supposed to be asleep, that <lb/>
one of the audience was forced to "scream out <lb/>
loud" with terror! This year of school-life passed <lb/>
happily away, and only served to intensify the <lb/>
girl's love of reading and study. The "standard <lb/>
authors," as she calls them, Milton, Shakespeare, <lb/>
Goldsmith, Scott, Byron, Wordsworth, were her <lb/>
great delight at this time, and in her letters to <lb/>
her school-friend, Ellen Mussey, she discusses them <lb/>
with a critical though reverential spirit, which <lb/>
showed that they were far more than tasks of <lb/>
literature to her.</p>
<p>At the end of the year she returned home to <lb/>
teach her younger sisters. Life in the quiet <lb/>
Parsonage must have seemed a trifle dull after <lb/>
the fun and companionship of school.</p>
<p>She sketches a day for her friend in these <lb/>
words:&mdash;"An account of one day is an account <lb/>
of all. In the morning, from nine o'clock till <lb/>
<pb n="256" entity="b000514724_0303"/>
half-past twelve, I instruct my sisters and draw; <lb/>
then we walk till dinner-time. After dinner I <lb/>
sew till tea-time, and after tea I write, read, or <lb/>
do a little fancy-work, or draw, as I please."</p>
<p>She never mentions her aunt in these letters, <lb/>
and she complains more than once of the difficulty <lb/>
of getting the books she wants. Her chief joy <lb/>
and that of her two sisters was a survival of the <lb/>
days of childhood. Hand in hand, the three <lb/>
would go up to the moors, where a long walk <lb/>
led to a waterfall, splashing over rocks to a hollow <lb/>
below.</p>
<p>Next to this came the delight, sanctioned by <lb/>
her father, frowned on by her aunt, of tramping to <lb/>
the nearest town for books from a circulating <lb/>
library. These she shared with her sisters, of <lb/>
whom Emily was now a lanky, silent girl of <reg orig="six-|teen">sixteen</reg>, <lb/>
and Anne a shy little woman a year younger. <lb/>
Branwell, his sisters' pride, who was going to make <lb/>
the whole family renowned by his artistic talent, <lb/>
was even in these days too popular in the <reg orig="tap-|room">taproom</reg> <lb/>
of the neighbouring tavern to have much <lb/>
time to spare for their society. This clever lad, <lb/>
spoilt by his aunt's indulgence and by his father's <lb/>
mistaken ideas of education, was now agitating to <lb/>
be sent as pupil to the Royal Academy. Money <lb/>
was short, as usual, in the household, and so at <lb/>
the age of nineteen Charlotte, in order to help <lb/>
matters on, went as teacher to Roe Head, taking <lb/>
Emily with her.</p>
<p>Charlotte was not sorry to get some variety from <lb/>
the monotonous home-life. To Emily, in many <lb/>
<pb n="257" entity="b000514724_0304"/>
ways the more striking and original character of <lb/>
the two, the change was heartbreaking. What <lb/>
happened is well described in her sister's own <lb/>
words:&mdash;</p>
<p>"My sister Emily loved the moors. Flowers <lb/>
brighter than the rose bloomed in the blackest <lb/>
of the heath for her; out of a sullen hollow on a <lb/>
livid hillside her mind could make an Eden. She <lb/>
found in the bleak solitude many and dear delights, <lb/>
and not the least and best loved was&mdash;liberty. <lb/>
Liberty was the breath of Emily's nostrils; without <lb/>
it she perished. The change from her own home <lb/>
to a school, and from her own very noiseless, <lb/>
very secluded, but unrestricted and unartificial <lb/>
mode of life, to one of disciplined routine, was <lb/>
what she failed in enduring. Her nature proved <lb/>
here too strong for her fortitude. Every morning <lb/>
when she woke, the vision of home and the moors <lb/>
rushed on her, and darkened and saddened the <lb/>
day that lay before her. Nobody knew what <lb/>
ailed her but me. &hellip; In this struggle her health <lb/>
was quickly broken: her white face, attenuated <lb/>
form, and failing strength threatened rapid decline. <lb/>
I felt in my heart she would die if she did not <lb/>
go home. She had only been three months at <lb/>
school, and it was some years before the <reg orig="ex-|periment">experiment</reg> <lb/>
of sending her from home was again <lb/>
ventured on."</p>
<p>So Emily gladly returned to her moors, to her <lb/>
beloved Anne and no less beloved dogs, and to <lb/>
those long silences and inward thoughts which <lb/>
were of a depth more profound and of a nature <lb/>
<pb n="258" entity="b000514724_0305"/>
more remarkable than those of any other of this <lb/>
gifted band. She was no idler, however.</p>
<p>Their old servant, "Tabby," had now become <lb/>
very infirm; whereupon Emily undertook most <lb/>
of the cooking, and all the household ironing <lb/>
and bread - making, studying German meantime <lb/>
"out of a book propped up before her, as she <lb/>
kneaded the dough; and nevertheless," says Mrs. <lb/>
Gaskell, "her bread was always light and <reg orig="excel-|lent">excellent</reg>!"</p>
<p>Meantime Charlotte, though hating what she <lb/>
called the "drudgery" of teaching, stuck to her <lb/>
post at Roe Head. But the girls were full of <lb/>
ambition, and their vivid imaginations were already <lb/>
sketching out plans for a life which would keep <lb/>
them together and enable them to fulfil some <lb/>
long cherished hopes.</p>
<p>In the long dark evenings of the December <lb/>
holidays of 1836, when nine o'clock struck and <lb/>
father and aunt and maid had gone off to bed so <lb/>
that they had the room to themselves, they were <lb/>
wont to walk up and down in the firelight, arm <lb/>
in arm, discussing and planning for the future. <lb/>
They had all three kept up the childish <reg orig="affec-|tion">affection</reg> <lb/>
for expressing themselves on paper, and the <lb/>
"rage for scribbling" was strong upon them; <lb/>
but they were uncertain as to the merit of their <lb/>
work.</p>
<p>They had lived so long, however, in the company <lb/>
of great writers, through the loving study of their <lb/>
works, that it was the most natural thing in the <lb/>
world for Charlotte to send a little budget to <lb/>
<pb n="259" entity="b000514724_0306"/>
the poet Southey, asking him his opinion of the <lb/>
contents. He wrote back kindly, but without <lb/>
encouragement, giving good advice as to <reg orig="self-|discipline">self-discipline</reg> <lb/>
and cultivation, which Charlotte received <lb/>
wisely if sorrowfully; and then, putting away the <lb/>
cherished manuscript with a sigh, returned to school, <lb/>
taking Anne with her as pupil.</p>
<p>Another year saw them together in holiday-time <lb/>
once more, and on this occasion something like <lb/>
mutiny broke out at the Rectory. For Tabby <lb/>
the faithful had slipped on the steep frozen <lb/>
street and broken her leg, whereupon Miss <lb/>
Branwell decided that she must go to her home <lb/>
and, being past work, must return no more. The <lb/>
girls objected. They would nurse Tabby and <lb/>
undertake the housework themselves. Miss <lb/>
Branwell, having enlisted Mr. Bront&euml; on her side, <lb/>
merely renewed her command; whereupon <lb/>
the three nieces sat silent and pensive each <lb/>
day before their untasted meals, having made <lb/>
up their minds to touch no food until their <lb/>
aunt gave way. This was altogether too much <lb/>
for Miss Branwell, and Tabby remained to be <lb/>
nursed and petted by her former charges.</p>
<p>A few more months of uncongenial <reg orig="school-|teaching">school-teaching</reg> <lb/>
broke Charlotte down. Anne's health <lb/>
had already given way in an alarming manner, <lb/>
and it seemed but too true that these wild <lb/>
birds could only live in their free moorland air. <lb/>
In the case of Charlotte and Emily, indeed, it <lb/>
was also a case of big, fiery, original souls fretting <lb/>
against and wearing out the frames which were <lb/>
<pb n="260" entity="b000514724_0307"/>
forced to unnatural primness and self-restraint <lb/>
among strangers.</p>
<p>The spring of 1839 saw them all at home again <lb/>
&mdash;saw, too, Charlotte's first offer of marriage from <lb/>
a young clergyman, supposed to be the original <lb/>
of "St. John" in <hi rend="italic">Jane Eyre</hi>. She tells us her <lb/>
characteristic reasons for refusal: "He knew so <lb/>
little of me &hellip; it would startle him to see me in <lb/>
my natural home character; he would think I was <lb/>
a wild, romantic enthusiast indeed. I could not sit <lb/>
all day long making a grave face before my <lb/>
husband. I would laugh and satirise and say <lb/>
whatever came into my head first." No, certainly <lb/>
the grave and priggish St. John was no mate <lb/>
for our wild-hearted little Jane Eyre, calm and <lb/>
quiet though she might appear to his unseeing <lb/>
eyes.</p>
<p>Yet the girls must do something. The thin <lb/>
family purse forbade them to stay idle at home, <lb/>
and Branwell, though he had not "entered the <lb/>
Academy," was a heavy burden both financially and <lb/>
otherwise.</p>
<p>He had left a post in a little school because the <lb/>
boys laughed at his red hair, and returned to <lb/>
lounging habits in the village taproom. Still, <lb/>
however, his sisters, and more especially Emily, <lb/>
his "chum," looked to him to retrieve the fortunes <lb/>
of the family; and Charlotte and Anne went off <lb/>
meantime, with heavy hearts, to teach in private <lb/>
families. Not for long, however, could they endure <lb/>
what to them, with their small love for and <reg orig="under-|standing">understanding</reg> <lb/>
of children must have been indeed a <lb/>
<pb n="261" entity="b000514724_0308"/>
weariness to the flesh; and 1840 saw the whole <lb/>
family together again.</p>
<p>This was an unusually happy year for them. <lb/>
Branwell's laziness and bad habits were condoned as <lb/>
a sign of genius, and his gay talk and magnificent <lb/>
plans for the future deceived even the austere <lb/>
old aunt. When the girls begged for a loan to <lb/>
enable them to set on foot their scheme for keeping <lb/>
a boarding - school at the Rectory, she refused <lb/>
on the score that her little savings were put aside to <lb/>
help her nephew towards a career.</p>
<p>Thrown back on herself, Charlotte began to <lb/>
write again; then cast her pen aside to take <lb/>
another uncongenial post, during which time the <lb/>
brilliant idea flashed upon her that the one thing <lb/>
essential to make a school of their own a real <lb/>
success was that she and Emily should, by hook <lb/>
or by crook, get six months' education in a foreign <lb/>
school.</p>
<p>Emily's heart must have sunk at the prospect: <lb/>
the very notion of leaving the moorlands was <lb/>
torture to her; but she was accustomed to conceal <lb/>
her feelings and to follow the lead of the dauntless <lb/>
Charlotte, and so it came about that after much <lb/>
discussion of ways and means, in which Aunt <lb/>
Branwell came nobly to the fore, the two <lb/>
girls found themselves installed as boarders in <lb/>
Madame H&eacute;ger's Pensionnat des Demoiselles at <lb/>
Brussels.</p>
<p>At first this new life was distasteful enough. <lb/>
It was not easy for women of twenty-four and <lb/>
twenty-six to put themselves in the position of <lb/>
<pb n="262" entity="b000514724_0309"/>
pupils again. Gradually, however, Charlotte fell <lb/>
under the spell of the genius of the fiery, masterful, <lb/>
excitable little Professor of French, M. H&eacute;ger, to be <lb/>
painted in glowing colours as M. Paul in <hi rend="italic">Villette</hi>. <lb/>
Emily disliked him from the first, and openly <lb/>
rebelled against his dictatorial ways. She was as <lb/>
homesick as ever; utterly unable to share in <lb/>
Charlotte's absorption in her new life and work. <lb/>
She prided herself on her English ways, her ugly <lb/>
English frocks; her mind was full of Haworth, and <lb/>
her overflowing heart found expression in lines <lb/>
carefully guarded from the sight of others:&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="stanza">
<l>"&hellip; As I mused, the naked room,</l>
<l>The alien firelight died away;</l>
<l>And from the midst of cheerless gloom</l>
<l>I passed to bright, unclouded day.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>A little and a lone green lane</l>
<l>That opened on a common wide;</l>
<l>A distant, dreary, dim blue chain</l>
<l>Of mountains circling every side:</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>Even as I stood with raptured eye,</l>
<l>Absorbed in bliss so deep and dear,</l>
<l>My hour of rest had fleeted by,</l>
<l>And back came labour, bondage, care."</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>We must not linger over these days in Brussels; <lb/>
for those who have grown to love the Bront&euml;s will <lb/>
find a faithful record of them in <hi rend="italic">Villette</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The <lb/>
Professor</hi>. Just at the time that M. H&eacute;ger, in <lb/>
order to keep his two most promising pupils, had <lb/>
appointed one as English mistress, the other as <lb/>
music teacher on his staff, an urgent message <lb/>
<pb n="263" entity="b000514724_0310"/>
arrived from Haworth. Miss Branwell was very <lb/>
ill. They hastened to pack their clothes and set <lb/>
off, but before they could do so, a second letter <lb/>
arrived.</p>
<p>Their aunt was dead. This news did but hasten <lb/>
their departure; for Anne was fairly happy in a <lb/>
post as governess, and their father was alone. <lb/>
They hastened back to find worse than the shadow <lb/>
of death in the lonely Parsonage. Branwell, the <lb/>
gifted, the genius, who had for some time past been <lb/>
acting as stationmaster at a little country village, <lb/>
had been dismissed in disgrace for drunkenness and <lb/>
careless neglect of duty, and had returned home to <lb/>
bring a grief to the old aunt who had so firmly <lb/>
believed in him, which probably shortened her <lb/>
days.</p>
<p>Still, the sisters renewed their faith in him and his <lb/>
repentance, refusing to recognise the inherent <lb/>
weakness in a nature that seemed as though it could <lb/>
never stand upright; and three months of peaceful <lb/>
moor walks and household duties followed. Then <lb/>
Anne went back to her post, Branwell obtained <lb/>
a situation as tutor in the same family, Charlotte <lb/>
returned to Brussels alone, and Emily, to her <lb/>
secret joy, was left behind in her beloved Haworth. <lb/>
Alone with the dogs,&mdash;Anne's old spaniel and her <lb/>
own bull-terrier, "Keeper," fierce to others, gentle to <lb/>
her,&mdash;the cats, and all the dear dumb creatures of the <lb/>
moorland, which appealed with such strength to the <lb/>
heart of this grave, silent, austere woman.</p>
<p>But dark days were at hand. Mr. Bront&euml;'s sight <lb/>
began to fail, and in his darkness and loneliness the <lb/>
<pb n="264" entity="b000514724_0311"/>
old man seemed to be falling into habits of drink. <lb/>
This became a perfect horror to Emily, with thoughts of <lb/>
Branwell always in her mind. She wrote to Charlotte, <lb/>
who at once laid aside her own work and hastened <lb/>
back to Haworth. Dull and quiet seemed to her <lb/>
the life that now opened out before her. She <lb/>
craved after the "rough realities of the world," as <lb/>
she called them.</p>
<p>But these were nearer to lonely Haworth than <lb/>
she imagined. A sense of depression fell upon the <lb/>
sisters. Mr. Bront&euml;, growing blinder every day, <lb/>
became very peevish and irritable; Charlotte grew <lb/>
daily more nervous, with a horrid sense of <reg orig="approach-|ing">approaching</reg> <lb/>
ill; Anne returned home full of misgivings and <lb/>
more than misgivings as to Branwell's conduct; <lb/>
and then suddenly the blow fell. Disgraced and <lb/>
scarcely sane, the young man returned home, to <lb/>
become a confirmed opium-eater and drunkard, and <lb/>
to break his sisters' hearts.</p>
<p>All thoughts of school-keeping were given up, <lb/>
Anne, always morbid, delicate, and easily depressed, <lb/>
sank into a state of dejection; Charlotte, her soul <lb/>
burning with indignation at the cause of all this <lb/>
misery, refused to speak to him or to treat him with <lb/>
aught but contempt; Emily alone was strong <lb/>
enough to shoulder the burden, and while hating <lb/>
the sin, to love the sinner.</p>
<p>Night after night, when all were in bed, Emily sat <lb/>
up waiting for the unsteady walk, the fumbling <lb/>
hand upon the latch, which heralded her brother's <lb/>
return from the public-house. She it was who gave <lb/>
him a cheering word, who saved him from being <lb/>
<pb n="265" entity="b000514724_0312"/>
burnt to death in drunken sleep, carrying him like <lb/>
a child to her own bed, while she herself slept in the <lb/>
kitchen, and who sat up at night, after Mr. Bront&euml; <lb/>
had insisted that his miserable son should sleep for <lb/>
safety in his room, listening with strained ears for <lb/>
the pistol-shot with which Branwell often threatened <lb/>
the blind old man.</p>
<p>Never perhaps has history shown us a case of <lb/>
more heroic devotion; never have sisters had to <lb/>
undergo a more terrible strain than during those <lb/>
two years. They could have no visitors, they <lb/>
scarcely dared to leave their home even for a week. <lb/>
It was small wonder that pent-up emotion found its <lb/>
vent in these stormy young hearts in lyric verse. <lb/>
A little volume of verse was made up of various <lb/>
treasured manuscripts; the sisters hid their identity <lb/>
under the names of Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell; <lb/>
and the packet went its dispiriting round from <lb/>
publisher to publisher, until at length one was found <lb/>
who undertook to bring out the little book of verse <lb/>
for the sum of &pound;30.</p>
<p>But it brought no fame to the Parsonage house, <lb/>
and little by little their dreams of glory faded away <lb/>
in the hard, matter-of-fact light of everyday troubles. <lb/>
Yet each had still her secret store of comfort and <lb/>
relief. Charlotte had sent <hi rend="italic">The Professor</hi> on his <lb/>
travels, Anne was busy over <hi rend="italic">Agnes Grey</hi>, Emily <lb/>
was laying bare her proud and passionate soul in <lb/>
the pages of <hi rend="italic">Wuthering Heights</hi>.</p>
<p>The evenings were still their own. Marching <lb/>
round the room in the old childish fashion, the three <lb/>
sisters talked over and criticised each other's <lb/>
<pb n="266" entity="b000514724_0313"/>
characters and plots; then sitting at the table, the <lb/>
three busy pens wrote fast, while the moorland wind <lb/>
wailed round the window. But nothing came of it <lb/>
save rejection and discouragement.</p>
<p>Meantime Mr. Bront&euml;'s sight had so far <reg orig="deterio-|rated">deteriorated</reg> <lb/>
that an operation was ventured on; and it <lb/>
was in his darkened room during the weeks that <lb/>
followed that Charlotte, sore at heart at the <lb/>
determined ill - fortune of <hi rend="italic">The Professor</hi>, began <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Jane Eyre</hi>. The origin of the green-eyed Jane was <lb/>
a discussion between the girls as to the impossibility <lb/>
of making a plain heroine acceptable to the public. <lb/>
"I will prove you wrong," said Charlotte, "by <lb/>
showing you a heroine as plain and small as <lb/>
myself who shall be as interesting as any of <lb/>
yours."</p>
<p>Soon after she returned home the news of the <lb/>
acceptance of <hi rend="italic">Wuthering Heights</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Agnes <lb/>
Grey</hi> arrived to cheer the drooping spirits of <lb/>
Emily, worn out by her unhappy charge, and gentle <lb/>
Anne, who had never recovered from the shock of <lb/>
his disgrace. The terrible part of <hi rend="italic">Wuthering <lb/>
Heights</hi>, the most powerful of all the Bront&euml;s' <lb/>
works, is that it forms largely a study, half <reg orig="un-|conscious">unconscious</reg>, <lb/>
no doubt, of the wretched Branwell. <lb/>
That it should be so was inevitable under the <lb/>
circumstances.</p>
<p>All the sisters, and Emily most of all, possessed <lb/>
the gift of sincerity so strongly that they could only <lb/>
write faithfully of what they had actually come <lb/>
across in their own experience. We have seen how <lb/>
very limited was that experience; and the whole <lb/>
<pb n="267" entity="b000514724_0314"/>
secret of the power and attraction of the novels lies <lb/>
in the fact that they are very largely <reg orig="autobio-|graphical">autobiographical</reg>.</p>
<p>But the stern insight and gloomy power of <lb/>
Emily's writing did not appeal to a public which <lb/>
preferred the feeble piping of <hi rend="italic">Agnes Grey</hi>. They <lb/>
failed to see that the very spirit of the moorland <lb/>
was incarnate in the book. No word of praise was <lb/>
heard; and its author, accepting the verdict of <lb/>
failure with stoic fortitude, tried to soothe an aching <lb/>
heart with harder tasks of household duties, more <lb/>
watchful vigilance, and more unselfish devotion to <lb/>
her wretched brother.</p>
<p>But <hi rend="italic">Jane Eyre</hi>, more melodramatic and <reg orig="unre-|strained">unrestrained</reg> <lb/>
emotionally, met with instant success. It <lb/>
is, of course, the most autobiographical of all the <lb/>
Bront&euml; books, in so far that it reflects very closely <lb/>
the personality of Charlotte herself, and describes <lb/>
most vividly the early experiences of herself and <lb/>
sisters at Cowan's Bridge.</p>
<p>Its flaring melodrama and weak portrayal of its <lb/>
so-called "heroes" does little to spoil the essential <lb/>
truth and rapid movement of the story; nor is the <lb/>
latter a defect to be wondered at when we remember <lb/>
that with the exception of a few despised curates, <lb/>
Charlotte's only male acquaintances of her own class <lb/>
were her father and her brother. Greatly <reg orig="en-|couraged">encouraged</reg> <lb/>
by her first success, Charlotte set to work <lb/>
on <hi rend="italic">Shirley</hi>, of which Emily, or rather a very <lb/>
fanciful portrait of Emily, was to be the heroine. <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Shirley</hi> is indeed a highly idealised character, <lb/>
but every now and then we get a glimpse of the <lb/>
<pb n="268" entity="b000514724_0315"/>
real Emily, the silent, stern, great-hearted woman <lb/>
whom not even Charlotte herself could altogether <lb/>
understand and appreciate.</p>
<p>It is Emily who always sits on the hearthrug of <lb/>
a night reading, with her hand resting on the broad <lb/>
head of her great bulldog, Keeper; Emily who <lb/>
punishes that same Keeper for misdemeanours, <lb/>
though warned that a blow will make him fly at her <lb/>
throat; and who, after thoroughly cowing him, <lb/>
brings water and foments his bruises; she too it <lb/>
is who, bitten by the mad dog to whom she <lb/>
had offered water, goes calmly to the kitchen <lb/>
and cauterises the horrid wound with a red-hot <lb/>
poker.</p>
<p>Meantime the real Emily was steeling herself <lb/>
to support Branwell in the miseries of his last <lb/>
hours. Of herself she never thought, though <lb/>
her hard, hacking cough was a source of great <lb/>
anxiety to her sisters. "It is useless to question <lb/>
her," says Charlotte; "you get no answers. It is <lb/>
still more useless to recommend remedies; they are <lb/>
never adopted."</p>
<p>One Sunday morning in this sad year 1848, <lb/>
Branwell Bront&euml; died&mdash;died on his feet, posing to <lb/>
the end, to "show his strength of will." His death <lb/>
should have lifted a burden from the shoulders of <lb/>
those whose loving hearts he had broken, but it <lb/>
was too late. It seemed as though Emily had kept <lb/>
up by sheer force of determination as long as he <lb/>
needed her help and protection, and now she gave <lb/>
way altogether. No words but Charlotte's can tell the <lb/>
touching tale:&mdash;</p>
<pb n="269" entity="b000514724_0316"/>
<p>"My sister Emily first declined. Never in all <lb/>
her life had she lingered over any task that lay <lb/>
before her, and she did not linger now. She sank <lb/>
rapidly. She made haste to leave us. Yet, while <lb/>
physically she perished, mentally she grew stronger <lb/>
than we had yet known her. Day by day, when <lb/>
I saw with what a front she met suffering, I looked <lb/>
on her with an anguish of wonder and love. I have <lb/>
seen nothing like it; but indeed I have never seen <lb/>
her parallel in anything. Stronger than a man, <lb/>
simpler than a child, her nature stood alone. The <lb/>
awful point was that while full of ruth for others, <lb/>
on herself she had no pity; the spirit was inexorable <lb/>
to the flesh; from the trembling hand, the unnerved <lb/>
limbs, the faded eyes, the same service was exacted <lb/>
as they had rendered in health. To stand by and <lb/>
witness this, and not dare to remonstrate, was a <lb/>
pain no words can render. Two cruel months of <lb/>
hope and fear passed painfully by, and the day <lb/>
came at last when the terrors and pains of death <lb/>
were to be undergone by this treasure, which had <lb/>
grown dearer and dearer to our hearts as it wasted <lb/>
before our eyes. Towards the decline of that day <lb/>
we had nothing of Emily but her mortal remains <lb/>
as consumption left them. She died December <lb/>
19, 1848."</p>
<p>They laid her by the side of the erring brother <lb/>
she had loved so faithfully, and returned to the <lb/>
house, where Keeper lay at the door of his mistress's <lb/>
room and howled piteously for many days. <reg orig="Down-|stairs">Downstairs</reg> <lb/>
the two lonely figures sat in the calm of <lb/>
heartbroken resignation. "The anguish of seeing <lb/>
<pb n="270" entity="b000514724_0317"/>
her suffer is over," writes her sister; "the spectacle <lb/>
of the pains of death is gone by; the funeral day is <lb/>
past. We feel she is at peace. No need now to <lb/>
tremble for the hard frost and the keen wind. Emily <lb/>
does not feel them."</p>
<p>So wrote Charlotte in that bleak December, never <lb/>
realising that before the midsummer roses were full <lb/>
blown, her gentle little sister Anne, with her quiet <lb/>
religious ways and clinging affection, would be taken <lb/>
from her also.</p>
<p>And now she was left alone in the sad, deserted <lb/>
Parsonage, where her father grew more and more <lb/>
solitary in his ways, and the pervading silence <lb/>
became a burden of oppression and horror to the <lb/>
nervous, overwrought, sad-hearted woman. To walk <lb/>
in loneliness round and round the fire-lit room, <lb/>
craving for that human companionship which is the <lb/>
soul's most crying need, listening to the moaning of <lb/>
the wind as it swept down from Emily's moorland <lb/>
with a wild impetuous rush, or sobbed round the <lb/>
casement for the remembrance of patient little Anne <lb/>
&mdash;such was Charlotte's dreary lot. Harder still <lb/>
was her self-imposed task of editing her dead sisters' <lb/>
books with a biographical sketch of each, in the very <lb/>
room in which those stories had been read aloud by <lb/>
their writers. No wonder the labour left her, as she <lb/>
says, "prostrate and entombed."</p>
<p>Fortunately, her publishers kept her supplied with <lb/>
the newest books, and gradually she allowed herself <lb/>
to go for occasional visits to the "great world." She <lb/>
was persuaded to visit London, and there made the <lb/>
acquaintance of Thackeray, her literary hero, whom <lb/>
<pb n="271" entity="b000514724_0318"/>
she idealised to an extent that made him decidedly <lb/>
uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Then hastening back to Haworth, she poured <lb/>
forth her soul in recollections of the happy year at <lb/>
Brussels, in the pages of <hi rend="italic">Villette</hi>.</p>
<p>Still the shadows gathered closer round that lonely <lb/>
house, haunted by Branwell's querulous tones, by <lb/>
Emily's silent presence, by Anne's hacking cough; <lb/>
and the knowledge of hard-won fame was of small <lb/>
consolation. Well might she cry, in Mrs. Browning's <lb/>
words&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"How dreary 'tis for women to sit still</l>
<l>On winter nights by solitary fires</l>
<l>And hear the nations praising them far off."</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>And then comes the one bit of romance in that <lb/>
sad, starved existence.</p>
<p>Yet scarcely romance; for the lover who appeared <lb/>
upon the scene was the most unromantic of curates, <lb/>
a Mr. Nicholls who had served her father faithfully <lb/>
in the parish for some years. He had loved her <lb/>
for a long time with a silent, faithful affection which <lb/>
only with difficulty expressed itself in words; and <lb/>
Charlotte seems to have ardently returned his love. <lb/>
But Mr. Bront&euml;, with the terrible selfishness of old <lb/>
age, would not hear of the marriage or of any <lb/>
intercourse between the lovers; so that Mr. Nicholls <lb/>
was obliged to leave Haworth, and the one glimpse <lb/>
of joy that seemed to have entered Charlotte's <lb/>
stunted life was extinguished.</p>
<p>A time of solitary anxiety and grief followed. <lb/>
Perhaps the old recluse began to realise his <reg orig="selfish-|ness">selfishness</reg>, <lb/>
<pb n="272" entity="b000514724_0319"/>
or at least to be convinced that, if he <reg orig="per-|sisted">persisted</reg> <lb/>
in his condemnation of the marriage, he <lb/>
could scarcely hope to save her from her sisters' <lb/>
fate. Suddenly he withdrew all opposition, and <lb/>
was eager only to hurry on matters as fast as <lb/>
possible.</p>
<p>Strange decree of fate, indeed, that gave to <lb/>
Charlotte, in the last nine months of her short life, <lb/>
that love and devotion, that joy of being first in the <lb/>
heart of another, for which her eager, passionate <lb/>
heart had always craved! Far better than fame <lb/>
to her was the peaceful joy of married life, still <lb/>
spent in the old Parsonage, that no change might <lb/>
trouble her father's last years. But it was not to <lb/>
be for long. She was married in June, and on the <lb/>
last day of the following March she died.</p>
<p>As with wild moorland birds, it seems as though <lb/>
the souls of the three sisters could not bear even <lb/>
the restraint of the happiest home, the most gilded <lb/>
cage. Disgrace had broken the wings of the <reg orig="gentle-|hearted">gentle-hearted</reg> <lb/>
Anne, it is true; but endurance had never <lb/>
tamed the wild heart of Emily, only fretting the <lb/>
cord that bound her to earth till she was free to fly <lb/>
from hence. And with Charlotte it was the same. <lb/>
Happiness had come too late: it was unnatural to <lb/>
the eager, restless soul to be loved and cared for; <lb/>
the cup of joy overflowed, and she too escaped into <lb/>
the unknown.</p>
<p>And so, when we read and re-read those <reg orig="won-|derful">wonderful</reg> <lb/>
novels, instinct with life and motion, we <lb/>
begin to realise the secret of their power. For <lb/>
they were written with heart's blood for ink and <lb/>
<pb n="273" entity="b000514724_0320"/>
the piercing dart of experience for pen. Yet <lb/>
even then they fall far short, in interest and <lb/>
romantic pathos, from the lives of those three <lb/>
sisters themselves, in their lonely home among the <lb/>
Yorkshire moors.</p>

<p>It is hard, too, for the sun to shine in Walsall, <lb/>
because of the pall of smoke that hangs over the <lb/>
town, with its many chimneys and great iron <lb/>
foundries. The inhabitants of the place are not <lb/>
of the most refined order, yet the roughest of <lb/>
the rough iron-workers had a smile and a nod <lb/>
for the bright-faced woman in nurse's uniform as she <lb/>
passed amongst them.</p>
<p>For it was she who had brought the sunshine <lb/>

had brought to them the gift of hope. And if <lb/>

<pb n="276" entity="b000514724_0325"/>
<p>"Who is it? Why, it's <hi rend="italic">our</hi> Sister Dora!"</p>
<p>In the year 1832 Dora Pattison was born in <lb/>
the little Yorkshire village of Hauxwell, in the <lb/>
North Riding of Yorkshire, of which her father <lb/>
was the rector. Her childhood was marked by a <lb/>
quiet but persistent determination to get her <lb/>
own way by one device or another, which <lb/>
already spoke of the strong will and firm <lb/>
purpose of the future woman. In these early <lb/>
days, however, it was occasionally doomed to <lb/>
failure. She tells an amusing story of some <lb/>
hated velvet bonnets which she and her sister <lb/>
were obliged to wear on Sundays. Dora was <lb/>
determined firmly to avoid appearing in them; <lb/>
so she waited for a soaking wet day, and only <lb/>
delaying long enough to make sure her mother <lb/>
had gone for a drive, rushed upstairs and said <lb/>
to her sister, "Be quick: now's our chance for <lb/>
spoiling our bonnets!"</p>
<p>Hastily they put them on, opened the library <lb/>
windows and stuck their heads well out, until <lb/>
the velvet was drenched through and through. <lb/>
When the soaking was complete, the offensive <lb/>
headgear was put away again. Sunday came, <lb/>
and their mother, seeing them bareheaded, inquired, <lb/>
"Where are your bonnets?"</p>
<p>"Quite spoilt," replied Dora firmly; "we can <lb/>
never wear them again."</p>
<p>Mrs Pattison thought differently, however; they <lb/>
were made to wear them for many a long week, and the <lb/>
naughty little girls were obliged to confess that they <lb/>
had not improved matters by their skilful man&oelig;uvre.</p>
<pb n="277" entity="b000514724_0326"/>
<p>The healthy, open life of the moors changed <lb/>
Dora from a delicate child to a strong, bonny, merry <lb/>
girl, full of a vigour which became restlessness as <lb/>
soon as her energy failed to find sufficient scope. <lb/>
She was intensely eager to join Miss Nightingale's <lb/>
band of nurses for the Crimea; but her father, <lb/>
realising her want of training and discipline, told <lb/>
her, quite rightly, that she would be worse than <lb/>
useless, and refused to let her go. She chafed <lb/>
inwardly, but outwardly submitted for a time to <lb/>
the quiet home - life, of which her bright face <lb/>
and never failing spirits made her the "Sunshine" <lb/>
that her father always called her. Then her <lb/>
mother died, and a new fit of restless energy took <lb/>
possession of the girl.</p>
<p>Nothing would content her but a life of hard <lb/>
work and poverty; and so she became a village <lb/>
schoolmistress, where she obtained all she could <lb/>
want of both. She loved the children and managed <lb/>
them excellently, but her vocation did not lie in <lb/>
the direction of teaching. The loneliness of the <lb/>
country cottage oppressed her spirits; she <reg orig="con-|stantly">constantly</reg> <lb/>
wished to be elsewhere. Suddenly she <lb/>
made up her mind that if she could but go into <lb/>
a Sisterhood all would be well&mdash;that the giving up <lb/>
of that strong will of hers would lead to perfect <lb/>
peace. A severe illness forced her to resign her <lb/>
school-work, and she barely allowed herself time <lb/>
to get well before attaching herself in her usual <lb/>
headstrong haste to a working Sisterhood at <lb/>
Coatham, in Yorkshire.</p>
<p>It was not in the least likely that such a <lb/>
<pb n="278" entity="b000514724_0327"/>
restricted life would suit her. She was of too <lb/>
strong a nature to mould her character according <lb/>
to the bidding of others, too fond of her own <lb/>
way to ever really give up her will, and had too <lb/>
masculine a force of both mind and body ever <lb/>
to settle down happily in a community of women. <lb/>
But it was a period of excellent discipline for her. <lb/>
Cleaning hearths, making beds, or scrubbing floors <lb/>
is no bad outlet for superfluous energy, though <lb/>
she was very thankful when the opening of a <lb/>
little cottage hospital at Walsall gave her more <lb/>
congenial work.</p>
<p>At first Sister Dora, as she was henceforth to be <lb/>
called, was the merest subordinate, as became her <reg orig="posi-|tion">position</reg> <lb/>
as a novice almost entirely ignorant of nursing.</p>
<p>Most of the cases brought to the hospital were <lb/>
surgical, the result of the ghastly accidents which <lb/>
were always occurring in the coal and iron <lb/>
pits; and so expert did she soon become in <lb/>
tending these that when a sudden order from <lb/>
the Coatham Sisterhood bade her go at once and <lb/>
nurse a private case in Devonshire, both the <lb/>
hospital committee and she herself were inclined <lb/>
to rebel. Just at that moment a letter reached <lb/>
her with the news that her father was dying, and <lb/>
earnestly wished to see her. She telegraphed <lb/>
to Coatham for leave to go to him at once; but, <lb/>
possibly with the idea that she needed to be <lb/>
taught the lesson of obedience and self-denial, this <lb/>
was refused. With a heavy heart, she set off for <lb/>
Devonshire, and had only just arrived when she <lb/>
heard of her father's death.</p>
<pb n="279" entity="b000514724_0328"/>
<p>She returned at once to Walsall, wretched and <lb/>
deeply depressed in mind and body. Henceforth <lb/>
her connection with the Sisterhood was much <lb/>
weakened, except in so far as she wished to carry <lb/>
on the work she had begun with them. A few <lb/>
years later she parted from it altogether; but <lb/>
long before this time her real vocation had made <lb/>
itself clear.</p>
<p>The cottage hospital no longer sufficed for its <lb/>
patients' needs, and when a new building was <lb/>
raised on the top of the "Mount," a hill <reg orig="over-|looking">overlooking</reg> <lb/>
the town, its sole management was put <lb/>
into the hands of Sister Dora. Scarcely was it <lb/>
opened when smallpox broke out in Walsall, and <lb/>
although infectious cases were not admitted, the <lb/>
brave woman, arguing that she was exposed to <lb/>
infection anyhow from the many surgical <reg orig="out-|patients">outpatients</reg> <lb/>
who came to her with the disease upon <lb/>
them, gave up the time that should have been <lb/>
devoted to sleep or rest, to nursing in their own <lb/>
homes those who otherwise would have been entirely <lb/>
neglected.</p>
<p>She was called one night to the bedside of one <lb/>
of her old patients, who was dying of the disease <lb/>
in its most malignant form. He was quite alone <lb/>
in a miserable room lit by one small bit of <reg orig="candle-|end">candle-end</reg>. <lb/>
Calling a neighbour, Sister Dora gave her <lb/>
money to buy some means of light, while she <lb/>
remained with the sufferer. The woman never <lb/>
returned, and so she sat in the gathering darkness <lb/>
alone with the dying man. Just as the candle <lb/>
was sputtering out, he rose in bed, exclaiming, <lb/>
<pb n="280" entity="b000514724_0329"/>
"Sister, kiss me before I die." She took him in <lb/>
her arms and kissed the poor disfigured face, <lb/>
promising she would never leave him while he <lb/>
lived. And then began the awful watching, in <lb/>
complete darkness, for the death which she did not <lb/>
recognise even when it came. For when, at the <lb/>
first glimmer of dawn, she went to seek his <lb/>
neighbours, the man had been dead some <lb/>
hours.</p>
<p>Her chief interest lay, however, in trying to save <lb/>
the limbs of those who had been mutilated by the <lb/>
machinery of the iron pits. One of these cases was <lb/>
especially touching. A fine strong young collier <lb/>
was brought in with a terribly mangled arm. <lb/>
"Nothing can save it; amputation must take place <lb/>
at once," pronounced the surgeon. The answering <lb/>
groan of despair from the patient called up on the <lb/>
nurse's face a look of such deep pity that the man <lb/>
exclaimed, "Oh, Sister, save my arm for me! It's <lb/>
my right arm."</p>
<p>Turning to the doctor, she said, "I believe I can <lb/>
save this arm, if you will let me try."</p>
<p>The doctor was naturally extremely angry, and <lb/>
told her roughly that he knew best, and that if the <lb/>
arm were not amputated at once, the man would die.</p>
<p>The patient listened eagerly to the altercation; <lb/>
but when the choice was given him, he gladly <lb/>
consented to take his chance with Sister <lb/>
Dora.</p>
<p>"Very well," said the irate surgeon; "but <lb/>
remember it's <hi rend="italic">your</hi> arm&mdash;you take the responsibility. <lb/>
I will have nothing to do with the case."</p>
<pb n="281" entity="b000514724_0330"/>
<p>So she was left to do as best she could. "How <lb/>
I prayed over that arm!" she used to say in later <lb/>
days, when she described the almost ceaseless <reg orig="tend-|ing">tending</reg> <lb/>
given to it for three weeks. At the end of that time, <lb/>
she called the doctor to inspect her work. "Why, <lb/>
you have saved it!" he cried, and with generous <lb/>
triumph brought in the whole of the hospital staff <lb/>
to show them "what could be done in the way of <lb/>
conservative surgery," as he called it.</p>
<p>Some time after her patient had left the hospital, <lb/>
Sister Dora had a severe illness, brought on by <reg orig="over-|work">overwork</reg> <lb/>
and worry. All through this anxious period this <lb/>
young man walked eleven miles into Walsall every <lb/>
Sunday, his only holiday, and giving a vigorous pull <lb/>
at the bell, would ask, "How's Sister?" And when <lb/>
he had been answered, he would say, "Tell her that's <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">her</hi> arm what rang the bell," and then turned to <lb/>
walk his weary journey back again.</p>
<p>Her influence over men was wonderful, and a <lb/>
sojourn in her hospital ward often sent a man out <lb/>
a reformed character. Her delightful humour was <lb/>
partly the secret of this influence. "Make you <lb/>
laugh?" said a burly Irishman. "She'd make you <lb/>
laugh if you were dying!"</p>
<p>"My dear," she would sometimes say, "if I could <lb/>
not laugh over the things, I don't know what I <lb/>
should do."</p>
<p>Her powers of endurance were even more <reg orig="mar-|vellous">marvellous</reg>. <lb/>
From the time she rose in the morning <lb/>
till the last thing at night she was incessantly at <lb/>
work; and the bell which hung over her bed, and <lb/>
communicated with the patients' ward, was seldom <lb/>
<pb n="282" entity="b000514724_0331"/>
still at night. Perhaps she erred on the side <lb/>
of thinking that no one could ever take her place or <lb/>
relieve her of any of her duties because of their <lb/>
comparative inefficiency; certainly her patients <lb/>
considered themselves ill-used if they were tended <lb/>
by any hands save hers.</p>
<p>In 1875 a fresh and terrible outbreak of <reg orig="small-|pox">smallpox</reg> <lb/>
occurred in Walsall. An epidemic hospital <lb/>
had been built on the outskirts of the town, but no <lb/>
power could induce the poor people to send their <lb/>
infected relations thither, and so stay the spread of <lb/>
the disease. At this crisis Sister Dora suddenly <lb/>
offered to leave her own work and go to nurse the <lb/>
patients in the smallpox hospital. The authorities <lb/>
eagerly seized the chance. Others might manage <lb/>
the accidents; only Sister Dora could induce the <lb/>
Walsall folk to send their smallpox cases to be <lb/>
under her care.</p>
<p>The offer was not made lightly; for Sister Dora <lb/>
was one of those who catch every disease to which <lb/>
they are exposed, and she went, moreover, with a <lb/>
depressing conviction that she should never return <lb/>
to her beloved accident wards. Yet she only <lb/>
flinched once from what she considered a plain <lb/>
duty, and that was when she found herself on the <lb/>
doorstep of the incredibly dismal building, standing <lb/>
in the midst of heaps of "slag," with a few blackened <lb/>
cabbages growing at its entrance.</p>
<p>Shivering with irrepressible dread at the thought <lb/>
of a lonely struggle with the most loathsome form <lb/>
of disease, she said to the surgeon who had brought <lb/>
her, "Oh, take me back! I can't endure this <reg orig="dread-|ful">dreadful</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="283" entity="b000514724_0332"/>
place&mdash;I did not know what it would be like!" <lb/>
His only reply was "Come in!"&mdash;and from the <lb/>
moment she crossed the threshold the victory was <lb/>
won.</p>
<p>Nothing but the strongest religious faith could <lb/>
have kept her up in the long battle with disease. <lb/>
She was quite alone save for two old women who <lb/>
came in occasionally from the workhouse to help <lb/>
with the washing, and a night porter who often <lb/>
stayed away and got drunk. Sometimes the delirious <lb/>
patients tried to escape, and she had a hard fight <lb/>
to keep them in bed. All this terrible time she had <lb/>
scarcely any rest, but read the most exciting novels <lb/>
she could get at night to prevent herself becoming <lb/>
too sleepy. When those who were attacked in their <lb/>
own homes refused to come to the hospital, the <lb/>
Sister would go and fetch them herself, lifting them <lb/>
in her arms to the ambulance as though they had <lb/>
been babies instead of grown men and women. <lb/>
Yet she could write, "I thank God daily for my life <lb/>
here. I feel He sent me, and He has blessed it to <lb/>
my own soul." And so that six months of incessant <lb/>
toil amid loathsome surroundings came to an end, <lb/>
and she returned with joy to her own beloved <lb/>
hospital.</p>
<p>Suddenly, in the midst of all her splendid work, <lb/>
the call came to lay it aside. A terrible internal <lb/>
disease manifested itself, but true to all her <reg orig="self-|denying">self-denying</reg> <lb/>
instincts Sister Dora kept the fact a <lb/>
complete secret, and went on working harder than <lb/>
ever. Then a period of enforced holiday occurred, <lb/>
while a new and improved hospital was being made <lb/>
<pb n="284" entity="b000514724_0333"/>
ready for her patients. She visited Paris and <lb/>
London, intent on studying the latest surgical <lb/>
appliances, but these she was never destined <lb/>
to use. Her disease made rapid progress, and <lb/>
her one cry now was, "Let me die among my own <lb/>
people!"</p>
<p>So she returned to Walsall, to a little house <lb/>
near the unfinished hospital; but the news of her <lb/>
severe illness was received by her "children" <lb/>
&mdash;rough miners and factory workers&mdash;with utter <lb/>
incredulity. Her wonderful strength and vitality <lb/>
had become a matter of course to them. "Her'll <lb/>
get well," they said; "her <hi rend="italic">never</hi> can be going to <lb/>
die."</p>
<p>But when they at length understood, despair <lb/>
reigned in all the slums and byways of Walsall. <lb/>
It was given her to see the new hospital opened, "in <lb/>
the name of Sister Dora"; but the end was <reg orig="draw-|ing">drawing</reg> <lb/>
very near. For a time she was haunted by a <lb/>
horror of that "Brother Death" whose approach <lb/>
had become so familiar to her in the case of others, <lb/>
but this at length passed quite away.</p>
<p>Years before, a little girl of nine years old, too <lb/>
badly burnt to live, had been laid in the nurse's <lb/>
arms. Nothing could be done for her, but Sister <lb/>
Dora never ceased to soothe and comfort the dying <lb/>
child until the end. The little one died quite <lb/>
happily, saying very simply, as she put up her <lb/>
mouth to be kissed, "When you come to heaven, <lb/>
Sister, I'll meet you at the gates with a bunch of <lb/>
flowers."</p>
<p>We can but believe that Sister Dora's last hour, <lb/>
<pb n="285" entity="b000514724_0334"/>
in the loneliness of death, was cheered by the <lb/>
remembrance of those many souls whom she had <lb/>
tended during their last moments and helped to face <lb/>
death with courage, and who now would throng to <lb/>
meet their "own Sister" on the other side of the <lb/>
grave.</p>

</epigraph>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">To</hi> Hope End, a woody and charmingly <reg orig="situ-|ated">situated</reg> <lb/>
estate among the Malvern Hills, there <lb/>
came in the year 1809 a retired West Indian <lb/>
planter, named Edward Barrett, together with his <lb/>
wife and little daughter, a child of barely three years <lb/>
old. Two more girls and eight boys came in due <lb/>
time to fill the Hope End nurseries, but from the <lb/>
first Elizabeth seems to have been her father's most <lb/>
darling child. Full of the warmth and fervent <lb/>
imagination of the South, the little maiden began <lb/>
very early to try to express her abundant fancies in <lb/>
verse.</p>
<p>"I wrote verses," she tells us, "at eight years old <lb/>
and earlier; but what is less common, the early <lb/>
fancy turned into a will and remained with me, and <lb/>
from that day to this, poetry has been a distinct <lb/>
object with me&mdash;an object to read, think, and <lb/>
live for."</p>
<pb n="288" entity="b000514724_0339"/>
<p>Fortunately for this aim, her unusual and <reg orig="pre-|cocious">precocious</reg> <lb/>
little mind was not forced through the mill <lb/>
of a commonplace education. Pope's Homer seems <lb/>
to have been her favourite reading from her eighth <lb/>
year; and so "the Greeks haunted her until she <lb/>
dreamed more of Agamemnon than of Moses the <lb/>
black pony."</p>
<p>Naturally enough, her first important attempt at <lb/>
self-expression was an "epic" in four books, <lb/>
written at the age of twelve, called <hi rend="italic">The Battle of <lb/>
Marathon</hi>. A much more important effect of her <lb/>
love for Pope's Homer was to turn her mind to the <lb/>
study of Greek. In her beautiful home among the <lb/>
hills she tells us that she "had her fits of Pope and <lb/>
Byron and Coleridge, and read Greek as hard under <lb/>
the trees as some of your Oxonians in the Bodleian; <lb/>
gathered visions from Plato and the dramatists, <lb/>
and ate and drank Greek, and made my head ache <lb/>
with it."</p>
<p>But she was not by any means a mere bookworm <lb/>
at this time. She had never been strong, but she <lb/>
loved outdoor exercise, especially riding. <reg orig="Unfor-|tunately">Unfortunately</reg>, <lb/>
this last delight brought about indirectly a <lb/>
complete cessation of all such things, and <reg orig="con-|demned">condemned</reg> <lb/>
her to the life of a chronic invalid. When <lb/>
Elizabeth was about fifteen, she ran out one day, <lb/>
impatient for her ride, to saddle her pony in the <lb/>
field.</p>
<p>Either by a fall, or from a strain in pulling the <lb/>
girths of the saddle, she injured her spine in a way <lb/>
that seriously affected her general health, even if it did <lb/>
not confine her to a sofa altogether for the first few years. <lb/>
<pb n="289" entity="b000514724_0340"/>
This sudden removal from active amusements was <lb/>
less of a trial to her than it would have been to <lb/>
many girls. She had always been dreamy and fond <lb/>
of solitude. Even in her earlier years her favourite <lb/>
game had been the lonely amusement of creating <lb/>
a giant out of turf, laid flat on the ground; and <lb/>
then, as she tells us in her poem of <hi rend="italic">Hector in the <lb/>
Garden</hi>, she made for him <lb/>
<q><lg type="stanza">
<l>"Eyes of gentianellar azure,</l>
<l>Staring, winking at the skies;</l>
<l>Nose of gillyflowers and box;</l>
<l>Scented grasses put for locks</l>
<l>Which a little breeze at pleasure</l>
<l>Set a-waving round his eyes.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>And a breastplate made of daisies,</l>
<l>Closely fitting, leaf on leaf;</l>
<l>Periwinkles interlaced,</l>
<l>Drawn for belt about the waist;</l>
<l>While the brown bees, humming praises,</l>
<l>Shot their arrows round the chief."</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>Now that she must rest and "go softly" all <lb/>
her days, her thoughts naturally turned more and <lb/>
more to her beloved heroes of Greek literature. <lb/>
Love of Greek stirred her to master the Latin <lb/>
language, and in these studies she had the sympathy <lb/>
of her favourite brother Edward, of whom she <lb/>
says&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"And when the laughing mood was nearly o'er</l>
<l>Together, many a minute did we wile</l>
<l>On Horace' page, or Maro's sweeter lore;</l>
<l>While one young critic on the classic style</l>
<l>Would sagely try to frown and make the other smile."</l>
</lg></q></p>
<pb n="290" entity="b000514724_0341"/>
<p>Her delicacy won for her a little bedroom for her <lb/>
own, a privilege much valued in that large and <lb/>
noisy family; and this is her description of it:&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"I had a little chamber in the house</l>
<l>As green as any privet-hedge a bird</l>
<l>Might choose to build in. &hellip;</l>
<l rend="indent">The walls</l>
<l>Were green, the carpet was pure green, the straight</l>
<l>Small bed was curtained greenly, and the folds</l>
<l>Hung green about the window, which let in</l>
<l>The out-door world with all its greenery.</l>
<l>You could not push your head out and escape</l>
<l>A dash of dawn-dew from the honey-suckle."</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>In this bower, then, we may picture her spending <lb/>
much of her time during the next few years. <lb/>
She was always much given to describing her own <lb/>
life and interests, either in letters or in poems, with <lb/>
that gift of self-revelation which nearly always <lb/>
accompanies a pronounced lyrical faculty, and from <lb/>
this time we can construct her whole biography <lb/>
almost in her own words.</p>
<p>The most important event in these quiet years of <lb/>
girlhood was her friendship with the blind Greek <lb/>
scholar, Hugh Stuart Boyd. Through his kindly <lb/>
help and interest, Elizabeth became soaked in Greek <lb/>
literature, which exercised a marked influence upon <lb/>
some of her future work. Very pleasant to the <lb/>
learned man with his darkened eyes were these <lb/>
times of study, but to the enthusiastic maiden they <lb/>
were golden hours indeed.</p>
<q><lg type="stanza">
<l>"As I think of those long mornings</l>
<l>Which my thought goes far to seek,</l>
<pb n="291" entity="b000514724_0342"/>
<l>When betwixt the folio's turnings,</l>
<l>Solemn flowed the rhythmic Greek.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>Then what golden hours were for us!&mdash;</l>
<l>While we sat together there;</l>
<l>How the white vests of the chorus</l>
<l>Seemed to wave us a live air!</l>
<l>How the cothurns trod majestic</l>
<l>Down the deep iambic lines,</l>
<l>And the rolling anap&aelig;stic</l>
<l>Curled, like vapour over shrines!"</l>
</lg></q>
<p>Six years of quiet study and confirmed ill-health <lb/>
passed away, marked chiefly by the excitement of <lb/>
the publication in 1826 of a little book of poems, <lb/>
written by Elizabeth before she was seventeen. <lb/>
They are not remarkable as poetry, for the thought <lb/>
was naturally immature, but the style and breadth <lb/>
of reading shown in them promised better things <lb/>
for the future.</p>
<p>But in 1826 poetry was laid aside for a time; <lb/>
for Mrs. Barrett, of whom we hear and know very <lb/>
little, but who was tenderly loved by her daughter, <lb/>
died, and Elizabeth, as the eldest, was left to cheer, <lb/>
guard, and console her father and seven brothers <lb/>
and sisters. Four years later, when the <reg orig="emancipa-|tion">emancipation</reg> <lb/>
of slaves began to affect her father's income <lb/>
very seriously, Hope End was sold, and the family <lb/>
migrated to Sidmouth, in Devonshire.</p>
<p>There Elizabeth's second volume, a translation <lb/>
of <hi rend="italic">Prometheus</hi>, was produced, a piece of work <lb/>
which she justly said in after days "should have <lb/>
been thrown in the fire, as the only means of <lb/>
giving it a little warmth." And then, after two <lb/>
years of sea and sunshine, which seem to have <lb/>
<pb n="292" entity="b000514724_0343"/>
caused her to lay aside all invalid habits, a house <lb/>
was taken in London, and the great city became <lb/>
Elizabeth's home for the rest of her unmarried life.</p>
<p>From this time, owing to the unfitness of her <lb/>
weak lungs and delicate frame to stand the heavy <lb/>
London atmosphere, Elizabeth became a <reg orig="con-|firmed">confirmed</reg> <lb/>
invalid. Two compensations were hers, <lb/>
however. Confinement to the house meant much <lb/>
extra time for literary work, and almost from the <lb/>
beginning of her life in London she became a <lb/>
regular contributor to the magazines. Partly <lb/>
through these poems, partly through the kind <lb/>
offices of Mr. Kenyon, a family connection whom <lb/>
she liked to call her cousin, she came to know a <lb/>
number of interesting figures in the world of <lb/>
literature. She met Wordsworth twice, and <lb/>
thought "she must certainly be dreaming." "His <lb/>
manners," she says, "are very simple, and his <reg orig="con-|versation">conversation</reg> <lb/>
not at all <hi rend="italic">prominent</hi>." Landor became an <lb/>
acquaintance, and Miss Mitford an intimate friend.</p>
<p>In 1838 a broken blood-vessel brought the <lb/>
young poet face to face with death, and from this <lb/>
time her hold on life was of the frailest. <reg orig="Un-|fortunately">Unfortunately</reg>, <lb/>
although Mr. Barrett would spend <lb/>
unheard-of sums in doctors and drugs, he would <lb/>
not hear of moving her from the place which was <lb/>
obviously the cause of her illness, but stifled her <lb/>
with care and cotton-wool in a gloomy London <lb/>
bedroom, where she lay and watched the sun <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"Push out through fog with his dilated disk,</l>
<l>And startle the slant roofs and chimney pots</l>
<l>With splashes of fierce colour."</l>
</lg></q>
<pb n="293" entity="b000514724_0344"/>
Or she saw the fog&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"Fog only, the great tawny weltering fog,</l>
<l>Involve the passive city, strangle it</l>
<l>Alive, and draw it off into the void,</l>
<l>Spires, bridges, streets and squares, as if a sponge</l>
<l>Had wiped out London."</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>At length, however, she became so ill that the <lb/>
doctors insisted on her removal to a warmer <lb/>
climate for the winter. This period extended <lb/>
itself to three years, and Torquay, the place <lb/>
selected, became the scene of the great tragedy <lb/>
of Elizabeth Barrett's life. Her brother Edward, <lb/>
the beloved "Bro" of her letters, had accompanied <lb/>
his favourite sister to her health resort. In the <lb/>
July following the autumn in which the migration <lb/>
had been made, while "Ba," as he always called <lb/>
her, was slowly improving in health and busy with <lb/>
new poems, Edward Barrett set out in a small <lb/>
boat with two friends, for a sail.</p>
<p>Night came, and they had not returned. Sick <lb/>
with anxiety, the lonely watcher left at home tried <lb/>
to persuade herself that they had landed <reg orig="else-|where">elsewhere</reg> <lb/>
and were returning by rail or on foot. The <lb/>
slow hours of Sunday dragged themselves away, <lb/>
and presently brought a rumour that a boat <reg orig="con-|taining">containing</reg> <lb/>
three men had been seen to founder in <reg orig="Babbi-|combe">Babbicombe</reg> <lb/>
Bay. Even then it was some days before the <lb/>
finding of the drowned men confirmed the report.</p>
<p>The horror and suspense of this dreadful <reg orig="experi-|ence">experience</reg> <lb/>
very nearly killed Elizabeth. She had always <lb/>
been inclined towards a morbid turn of thought <lb/>
<pb n="294" entity="b000514724_0345"/>
and now that her spirit was crushed by the weight <lb/>
of grief, she fancied that she had been the cause <lb/>
of his ultimely death, in having begged him to <lb/>
share her exile. She speaks piteously in her <lb/>
letters of her "tendency to lie down to sleep <lb/>
among the snows of a weary journey"; and her <lb/>
whole remaining strength was consumed in her <lb/>
desire to get away from Torquay and from the <lb/>
hateful sound of the sobbing of the treacherous <lb/>
waves upon the shore. For this she had to wait <lb/>
another year, and then her return was only to a <lb/>
state of chronic invalidism in her London home.</p>
<p>The dreariness, the "stuffiness," as modern girls <lb/>
would say, of such an existence, can scarcely be <lb/>
described. She chronicles as a really startling <lb/>
event that "the window has twice been open for <lb/>
an inch"! and this window did not even look <lb/>
upon the street, with its ever-changing pictures of <lb/>
humanity. Her state of health was at this time <lb/>
such that she fainted regularly on being carried <lb/>
from the bed to the sofa. One is tempted to <lb/>
wonder what would have been the treatment <lb/>
meted out to Elizabeth Barrett by a doctor of <reg orig="to-|day">today</reg> <lb/>
with a passion for the "open-air cure."</p>
<p>In the light of future events it is not very <lb/>
audacious perhaps to think that had she been <lb/>
transferred to a sunny climate and made to live <lb/>
out of doors and take regular exercise, the <reg orig="sick-|room">sickroom</reg> <lb/>
would have known her no more. But <lb/>
those were the days of coddling and distrust of <lb/>
air and light, and it is all the more credit to her <lb/>
that her spirit and intellect, when she had once <lb/>
<pb n="295" entity="b000514724_0346"/>
recovered the shock of Edward's death, did not <lb/>
flag with her body.</p>
<p>She was always busy with her sweet, fanciful <lb/>
poetry; she read every new book and a great <lb/>
many old ones; and she was quite human <lb/>
enough to take a very real delight in the charming <lb/>
spaniel "Flush," who now came into her possession, <lb/>
and indeed into her very heart.</p>
<p>"Flush's breathing is my loudest sound," she <lb/>
says, in describing the silence of her sickroom, <lb/>
"and then the watch's tickings, and then my own <lb/>
heart when it beats too turbulently. Judge of the <lb/>
quiet and the solitude!"</p>
<p>Very patheric, too, is her description of how she <lb/>
planted ivy in a window-box, that, when it tapped <lb/>
the window panes in rough weather, it might <lb/>
speak to her of the joys of the natural world <lb/>
which seemed so far away.</p>
<p>Yet it was during these silent years that her <lb/>
best work was done. Her <hi rend="italic">Cry of the Children</hi> did <lb/>
much to hasten the passing of an Act of Parliament <lb/>
restricting the working age of the little ones:&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"Do you hear the children weeping, O my brothers,</l>
<l>Ere the sorrow comes with years?</l>
<l>They are leaning their young heads against their mothers'&mdash;</l>
<l>And <hi rend="italic">that</hi> cannot stop their tears.</l>
<l>The young lambs are bleating in the meadows;</l>
<l>The young birds are chirping in the nest;</l>
<l>The young fawns are playing with the shadows;</l>
<l>The young flowers are blowing towards the west&mdash;</l>
<l>But the young, young children, O my brothers,</l>
<l>They are weeping bitterly!&mdash;</l>
<l>They are weeping in the playtime of the others,</l>
<l>In the country of the free."</l>
</lg></q></p>
<pb n="296" entity="b000514724_0347"/>
<p>Her <hi rend="italic">Lessons from the Gorse</hi> is a curiously <lb/>
beautiful bit of Nature painting to come from <lb/>
the pen of one who directly the "angel of <lb/>
summer" had fled away, was shut up in her <lb/>
prison bedroom with rigorous care and <reg orig="com-|pleteness">completeness</reg>. <lb/>
"The prison doors are shut close, and <lb/>
I could dash myself against them sometimes with <lb/>
a passionate impatience of the needless captivity," <lb/>
she writes in an unwonted burst of revolt. "I <lb/>
feel so intimately, and from evidence, how, with <lb/>
air and warmth together in any fair proportion, <lb/>
I should be as well and happy as the rest of the <lb/>
world&mdash;it is intolerable."</p>
<p>We could wish, perhaps, that she had summoned <lb/>
up the strength to rebel against the strong <lb/>
parental will and utterly mistaken hygienic views <lb/>
that made such an imprisonment possible for five <lb/>
long winters. But release was at hand; and into <lb/>
the darkened atmosphere, laden with the scent <lb/>
of medicines and prescriptions, there came all at <lb/>
once the brightest and breeziest of out-of-door <lb/>
spirits, prepared to carry off the prisoner if need be <lb/>
in his very arms.</p>
<p>Ever since January 1845, Elizabeth Barrett <lb/>
had kept up a flourishing correspondence with <lb/>
Robert Browning, "author of <hi rend="italic">Paracelsus</hi> and king <lb/>
of the mystics," as she calls him. In the May <lb/>
of that same year they first met in person, and <lb/>
from that time Browning became a frequent <lb/>
visitor to the house in Wimpole Street and to the <lb/>
sofa where Miss Barrett lay.</p>
<p>Rapidly their friendship ripened into love&mdash;a <lb/>
<pb n="297" entity="b000514724_0348"/>
love which was never damped for him by the <lb/>
thought of marrying a wife who at that time <lb/>
seemed utterly unable even to stand upright, though <lb/>
Elizabeth was painfully aware, on her part, of two <lb/>
serious difficulties. She dreaded to burden the <lb/>
life of her already famous lover by the <reg orig="responsi-|bility">responsibility</reg> <lb/>
of an invalid wife; and even more she <lb/>
dreaded the determined opposition of her father, <lb/>
who had always regarded his children as belonging <lb/>
solely to himself, in the same way as his household <lb/>
furniture.</p>
<p>More especially, too, since his favourite daughter <lb/>
had won fame by her poetry, he was only too <lb/>
likely to look upon any attempt to leave his roof <lb/>
as an act of treacherous ingratitude.</p>
<p>Any sympathy we may feel for Mr. Barrett <lb/>
for his excess of parental jealousy is largely <lb/>
discounted when we remember that in this same <lb/>
year, when the doctors strongly pressed Elizabeth <lb/>
to winter abroad as almost the only means of <lb/>
preserving the little strength she had gained <lb/>
throughout the summer, her father met the <lb/>
proposal with an absolute refusal. He had grown <lb/>
used to shutting his daughter up in solitary <lb/>
confinement from September to May, and he <lb/>
would not hear of any attempt to break through <lb/>
the established rule. He treated her, moreover, <lb/>
with great displeasure, and scarcely saw her during <lb/>
the long dark days, because of her natural attempt <lb/>
to improve her state of health.</p>
<p>Deeply wounded by this treatment, Elizabeth <lb/>
determined to take fate into her own hands, as <lb/>
<pb n="298" entity="b000514724_0349"/>
the only way of escape from the dreariness of her <lb/>
existence in the gloomy London house.</p>
<p>She promised, therefore, that if she lived through <lb/>
the ensuing winter she would marry her lover <lb/>
before the next year. An unusually mild season <lb/>
brought her safely into May, and at once he <lb/>
claimed her promise. During the summer she <lb/>
gained strength enough to drive, and even walk <lb/>
for a little way; and meantime plans were made. <lb/>
No one knew of them, for it was hopeless to <lb/>
ask Mr. Barrett's approval, and his wrath would <lb/>
fall heavily on those who might be implicated in <lb/>
the plot.</p>
<p>And so it came to pass that on September 12, <lb/>
1846, with her faithful maid Wilson in attendance, <lb/>
she slipped quietly from the house, and was married <lb/>
to Robert Browning in Marylebone Church.</p>
<p>A week later she left her home for ever, and <lb/>
joining her husband, crossed at once to Paris, <lb/>
carrying with her only Wilson and her beloved <lb/>
Flush as remnants of her old life. A new existence <lb/>
of love and joy and comparative health lay before <lb/>
her, only shadowed by the unrelenting wrath of her <lb/>
father, who would neither read her letters nor ever <lb/>
look upon her face again.</p>
<p>Italy, the home of poets, was henceforth to be <lb/>
the abiding-place of Mr. and Mrs. Browning, and <lb/>
Florence became the scene of one of the very <lb/>
happiest wedded lives that has ever been dreamed <lb/>
of. Happiness was no bar to literary work, <lb/>
though, as the following charming incident shows. <lb/>
It was their habit to write in separate rooms, and <lb/>
<pb n="299" entity="b000514724_0350"/>
not to show each other what they had written. <lb/>
"One morning, early in 1847, their breakfast <lb/>
being over, Mrs. Browning went upstairs, while <lb/>
her husband stood at the window watching the <lb/>
street till the table should be cleared.</p>
<p>"He was presently aware of someone behind <lb/>
him, although the servant was gone. It was <lb/>
Mrs. Browning, who held him by the shoulders <lb/>
to prevent him turning to look at her, and at the <lb/>
same time pushed a packet of papers into the <lb/>
pockets of his coat. She told him to read that, <lb/>
and to tear it up if he did not like it; and then <lb/>
she fled again to her own room."</p>
<p>These papers were the "Sonnets from the <reg orig="Portu-|guese">Portuguese</reg>," <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">not</hi> translations, as the uninitated suppose, <lb/>
but the simple and sincere story of her love. She <lb/>
had written them without a thought of publication, <lb/>
but Mr. Browning, in his own words, "dared not <lb/>
reserve to himself the finest sonnets since <lb/>
Shakespeare's written in any language." They <lb/>
were printed privately, and not till three years <lb/>
later did they appear before the general public.</p>
<p>Never, perhaps, has there been known such a <lb/>
perfect wedded life as that of these two <reg orig="poet-|lovers">poet-lovers</reg>. <lb/>
There is little to recount of its beautiful <lb/>
story, because it was so blissful and happy. "I <lb/>
have happiness," writes Mrs. Browning, "enough <lb/>
for my share to be divided among all my friends <lb/>
and leave everyone contented. For me, I take <lb/>
it for pure magic, this life of mine. Surely <lb/>
nobody was ever so happy before."</p>
<p>In the March of 1849 came the crowning joy <lb/>
<pb n="300" entity="b000514724_0351"/>
of Mrs. Browning's life&mdash;the birth of her little son <lb/>
Robert, "Peninni," as she generally calls him. <lb/>
Two years later the Brownings paid their first <lb/>
visit to England since their wedding. It was not <lb/>
a success. Mr. Barrett still obstinately refused to <lb/>
see his daughter or to hear of her welfare, and the <lb/>
change of climate quickly affected Mrs. Browning <lb/>
for the worse. "My first step ashore was into a <lb/>
puddle and a fog," she writes, "and I began to <lb/>
cough before we reached London."</p>
<p>They went to Paris for a while, but returned <lb/>
to London for the summer; and in November of <lb/>
that year were safely settled in their "Casa Guidi" <lb/>
at Florence once again. Here Mrs. Browning <lb/>
began her longest poem, <hi rend="italic">Aurora Leigh</hi>; and <lb/>
about the same time the mystical side of her <lb/>
nature began to assert itself in an interest and <lb/>
belief in spiritualism&mdash;a taste which became the <lb/>
only source of difference, and that a very slight <lb/>
one, between herself and her husband, whose more <lb/>
robust mind was utterly averse from the whole <lb/>
subject. But to judge from her charming letters, <lb/>
the great interest of Mrs. Browning's life was her <lb/>
boy.</p>
<p>In no case, perhaps, was the mistaken slur <lb/>
generally cast on "literary mothers" more out of <lb/>
place. She was perfectly devoted to him, and he <lb/>
was extraordinarily like her, with the same delicate <lb/>
features and Ariel-like mind. A visitor of this <lb/>
period describes her thus:&mdash;"She is very small, <lb/>
delicate, dark, and expressive. She looks like <lb/>
a spirit. A cloud of hair falls on each side of <lb/>
<pb n="301" entity="b000514724_0352"/>
her face in curls, so as partly to veil her features. <lb/>
But out of the veil look sweet, sad eyes, musing <lb/>
and far-seeing and weird. Her fairy fingers look <lb/>
too airy to hold, and yet their pressure was very <lb/>
firm and strong. The smallest possible amount <lb/>
of substance encloses her soul, and every particle <lb/>
of it is infused with heart and intellect."</p>
<p>Her impressions of Peninni are equally well <lb/>
described:&mdash;</p>
<p>"In the dim light he looked like a waif of <lb/>
poetry, drifted up into the dark corner, with long <lb/>
curling brown hair, and buff silk tunic embroidered <lb/>
with white.&hellip; In a brighter light he was lovelier <lb/>
still, with brown eyes, fair skin, and a slender, <lb/>
graceful figure."</p>
<p>But in spite of her love for little Peninni, the first <lb/>
place in Mrs. Browning's heart was filled with her <lb/>
intense affection for her poet-husband. Always her <lb/>
most sympathetic confidant, her nurse during her <lb/>
still frequent attacks of illness, her devoted lover <lb/>
throughout the happy fifteen years of their wedded <lb/>
life, he was ever by her side, her first thought, her <lb/>
one great abiding joy. For him she lived, and in <lb/>
his loving arms she died.</p>
<p>It was on June 29, 1861, that the end came <lb/>
to her happy life. A chill touched the lungs, <lb/>
always terribly frail; but no one thought it was <lb/>
anything more serious than her usual attacks. <lb/>
"There was no lingering, nor acute pain, nor <lb/>

sleeping child from a dark, uneasy bed into your <lb/>

arms and the light. The last word was, when I <lb/>
asked, 'How do you feel?' 'Beautiful!'"</p>
<p>Such was the peaceful passing of one of the <lb/>
most lovely spirits of this earth. Florence was <lb/>
her home in death, as it had been her ideal abode <lb/>
in life; and over her was written in Italian this <lb/>
inscription:&mdash;</p>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">here wrote and died</hi> <lb/>
ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING <lb/>
<hi rend="small-caps">who in her woman's heart united <lb/>
the wisdom of the sage and the eloquence <lb/>
of the poet <lb/>
with her golden verse linking italy <lb/>
to england <lb/>

this memorial <lb/>
a.d. 1861.</hi></p>
