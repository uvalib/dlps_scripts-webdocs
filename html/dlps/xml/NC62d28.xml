    <p>Charlie comments favorably on Addie's new school teaching career. He reminds her that she is
     free to make her own decisions, and that he would do anything for her. He glories over the
     beautiful spring and reminds her that he will be 21 years old soon.</p>

    <p> So you are going away from <lb/>
     <name type="place">Mecca</name> to be <name type="recipient">"Addie"</name> no longer, but
      <orig reg="Mistress">Mistre&longs;s</orig><ref target="n1" n="1">1</ref>. <lb/> To leave
      "<name type="place">Maple Grove</name>", Papa, <name type="person"
     >Laurie</name><!-- Addie's sister Laura -->, and <lb/> Auntie (to say nothing of the rest.) and
     install <lb/> yourself as head of a large school, to "teach <lb/> the young scholars how to
     shoot". I fancy I <lb/> see you just ringing the first bell; then as <lb/> that strange motley
     crowd gathers in and <lb/> by pairs sort themselves, and then then as <lb/> you tap the bell to
     secure order. I seem to<lb/> see you look around as if seeking if some <lb/>
     <hi rend="underline">friend</hi> were there. Did I hear aright?<lb/> Methought I heard a
     chapter from the Bible<lb/> by way of introduction. Then I heard that silvery<lb/> voice -
     perhaps at first tremblingly - addressing<lb/> the school in accents of <orig reg="kindness"
      >kindne&longs;s</orig> saying you<lb/> will love and wish to be loved. Do not <lb/> fear,
     my love. I have been in the same place.<lb/>

    <p> I just upset my ink, and the sutler had nothing<lb/> but blue. I received your letters of
     the <lb/> 16th and 17th this morning a few moments <lb/> before drill, and I actually believe
     that they<lb/> have cured my headache, which I have had <lb/> for some time. I suppose that you
     have broken<lb/> the ice ere this, and commenced your school <lb/> and I trust you will have
     perfect <orig reg="success">succe&longs;s</orig>.<lb/> I cannot see why you did not receive
     a letter <lb/> from me relative to your teaching. I left it<lb/> all to yourself, for I cannot
     believe it my duty<lb/> to decide whether you <hi rend="underline">can</hi> or <hi
      rend="underline">cannot</hi> do a <lb/> thing - by no means - for on the contrary your<lb/>
     wishes should be, and are <hi rend="underline">my law</hi>. It is<lb/> perhaps well that you
     are to teach this summer<lb/> I should love to have seen you and have had<lb/> a good long
     visit before you commenced. but - I <lb/> could not. "Get ready for inspection in half an <lb/>
     hour," is the order, and "orders must be obeyed."</p>
    <lb/>
    <p> You must describe <name type="place">Claridon</name> and its people <lb/> for me. <hi
      rend="super"><add hand="h1" place="supralinear">Give me your "experience.</add>"</hi>
     <lb/> Do you board around? If so please<lb/>

    <p> Well, "inspection" is over, and I will<lb/> write until "<orig reg="Dress"
     >Dre&longs;s</orig> Parade", when of course<lb/> I shall have to go.</p>
    <p>What a beautiful<lb/> day! But then of course, you have them<lb/> at home. We had quite a
     heavy fall of<lb/> snow the 23rd and<ref target="n2" n="2">2</ref> 24th, and it contrasted<lb/>
     strangely - but beautifully, with the dark<lb/> Cedar and bright Peach <orig reg="blossoms"
      >blo&longs;soms</orig>, as it hung<lb/> in wreaths upon the boughs. But it did <lb/> not
     last long. Rain came, and the ground<lb/> was soon covered with <hi rend="underline">mud</hi>,
     instead<lb/> of the pure white snow.<lb/>
    </p>

    <p> I too love flowers and the sight of<lb/> those familiar flowers, which I have often<lb/>
     gathered "when spring time comes." filled<lb/> my heart with joy, and I almost wished<lb/> "I
     were a boy again," - ha! ha! What am I yet,<lb/> but a <hi rend="underline">boy</hi>? My
     twenty-first year commences<lb/> the 8th of next month, when, - well - <hi rend="underline"
     >I</hi> can't <lb/> tell what. I <orig reg="guess">gue&longs;s </orig>I shall love you <hi
      rend="underline">more</hi>, and<lb/> with a more manly affection. <hi rend="super">

    <p> Indeed, <name type="person">Hallie</name>
     <!-- Addie's brother Hal --> must have an exalted opinion<lb/> of "darkies." Truly! But I am
     proud to know<lb/> he loves me, and if I <hi rend="underline">do not</hi> merit all his<lb/>
     commendations, I cannot but be proud of<lb/> the compliment. Of <hi rend="underline">him</hi>,
     I can but say, he<lb/> is Nature's nobleman - a man worthy the love<lb/> of a people.</p>
    <p>Is Dora to be one of your<lb/> scholars this summer? If so, you must not<lb/> allow too much
      <abbr expan="familiarity">fam</abbr> in school, - I mean, you <lb/> may do just as you please. </p>
    <p>You will have<lb/> many trials and privations this summer, but<lb/> remember that upon
     yourself depends all, and<lb/> God will sustain and protect you. If I can be<lb/> of any <orig
      reg="assistance">a&longs;sistance</orig> to you in any manner, <hi rend="underline">do
      not<lb/> fail to </hi>let me know, and I will gladly <lb/> render it. You know, my heart well
     enough<lb/> by this time, to know that anything I <lb/> can do for you, I would do, even die
     for your <lb/> sake. </p>
    <p>Whirr-r-r-r tap-tap-tap-tap. <abbr expan="Adjutant's">Adjuts</abbr>.<lb/> Call. A large mail
     has come. Is there<lb/> anything for me? Oh yes. A paper. Pshaw, why<lb/> don't a letter come?
     Just as I wrote-thought-<lb/> last word, I heard my name called, and<lb/> to my joy, more mail
     had come, and yours<lb/> and Laurie's letter was included. Now I<lb/> shall write a little
     longer.<lb/>
    </p>

    <p> I shall try another sheet of paper.<lb/> Perhaps I can fill it.<lb/>
