    <p> How very much <lb/> I thank you for your darling letter <lb/> that arrived last evening. You
     know <lb/> not dearest how long and anxuously <lb/> I had looked for a letter since you <lb/>
     wrote of your recent indisposition..-- <lb/> how I had prayed God to watch over <lb/>
     <hi rend="underline">thee</hi> in sickness and in health,-- <lb/> how I had mour[n]ed over the
     fate <lb/> that has kept such a barrier of miles <lb/> twixt <hi rend="underline">thee</hi> and
     me. best beloved-- <lb/> until I was nearly ill.. If you would <lb/> spare me pain my love <hi
      rend="underline">write often</hi>
     <lb/>
     <pb n="2" entity="DSSR_000000766_0236"/> True your excuses were sufficient. and <lb/> I forgive
     you Indeed the joy of once <lb/> again hearing from you--of once again <lb/> reading your own
     dear loving thoughts <lb/> addressed to <hi rend="underline">me</hi> darling more than <lb/>
     cancled all the pain I had suffered <lb/> And art thou now well now darling? <lb/> Art thou
     suffering far away from me-- <lb/> with no kind hand to alleviate the pain <lb/> Look to God
     dearest. He can relieve <lb/> and be with you. for much as I regret <lb/> it I can not be with
     you only in spirit <lb/> and that--<hi rend="underline">always</hi>. How very thankful <lb/> I
     am darling that you are in the <lb/> position you now occupy instead of <lb/> performing the
     arduous duties of camp <lb/> life and marching As Carrie said-- <lb/> our Carrie Kibbee)-- when
     I told her <lb/> where you were. "Oh! Addie, are'nt you <lb/>
     <hi rend="underline">so</hi> glad". and <add place="inline" hand="h1">in</add> the. dear girls
     joy . she <lb/> actually--kissed me. </p>
    <p> Oh. darling how I wish you to come <lb/> home, Were you here I do believe you <lb/>
     <pb n="3" entity="DSSR_000000766_0237"/> would regain health and strength much <lb/> faster
     than you now do. I would devote <lb/> myself so much to your happiness that <lb/> you could not
     help but get well, <lb/> Do you not thing so dear? <lb/>
    </p>
    <p> Did you intend darling to bid me <lb/>
     <hi rend="underline">hope</hi> when you said if the thing were <lb/> possible you would come
     home this winter; <lb/> If so. that you a thousand times, How <lb/> much I wish you to return.
     why you <lb/>
     <hi rend="underline">can not</hi> know.. But you will wish to <lb/> know about my self will you
     not dear? <lb/> I am well. much better than I was <lb/> before I recieved you precious letter.
     and <lb/> am enjoying myself as well as I can-- <lb/> from <hi rend="underline">thee</hi>, I
     like Farmington very much <lb/> indeed, also the school. Although I <lb/> have not as yet
     become acquainted with <lb/> many of the students yet time passes <lb/> swiftly and pleasantly.
     Indeed I see <lb/> no reason why it should not. Altho. <lb/> Hallie and papa would not premit
     <lb/> me to take as many studies as <lb/>
     <pb n="4" entity="DSSR_000000766_0238"/> I wished to do. yet with the splendid <lb/> company of
      M<hi rend="super">r</hi> Kibbee's family with whom <lb/> I am boarding time does not lag I can
     <lb/> assure you. How much I desire you to <lb/> become acquainted with Carrie and Emma, <lb/>
     they are such splendid girls <lb/> Would you like to know the subjects of <lb/> my studies?
     They are Algebra. Latin and <lb/> Music. I wished very much to take another <lb/> study, but
     Hal. would not listen to it. <lb/> It affords me an opportunity of reading more <lb/> than I
     could otherwise do, We spend very <lb/> pleasant evenings in reading useful and <lb/>
     appropriate books, Would you not like to <lb/> join our circle some evening? I should dearly
     <lb/> love to have you do so, But darling, it is <lb/> getting late besides here are Mr, and
     Mrs. <lb/> Kibbee. Carrie and Emma, Miss Michalson. <lb/> (an assistant teacher in the
     seminary) and <lb/> Mr Wolcott, son-in-law of Mr. Kibbee's, <lb/> all discussing the one common
     theme--War <lb/> Quite an interesting discussion, <lb/> You will excuse this short letter
     darling? <lb/> I would write more in the morning but <lb/> the mail goes out quite early and I
     will <lb/> not have time. Be very careful of your <lb/> health dearest, and write very soon too </p>
