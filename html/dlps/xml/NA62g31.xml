                <p> As I have allowed so long a<lb/> time to pass without writing to you I thought
                    it<lb/> would be very appropriate to write on the last day<lb/> of the month.
                    Shall I beg pardon dearest, or not?<lb/> My only excuse for not writing sooner
                    is that I<lb/> have had no<del hand="h1">t</del> time.<lb/>
                </p>

                <p> How has the <del hand="h1">[unclear]</del> month of July been spent<lb/> by

                    pleasant hours "amongst friends at home," but not such<lb/> pleasant ones as in

                <p> I attended the "Aid Society" at <name type="place">E. Claridon</name> yesterday
                    for the first<lb/> time. How happy the ladies seem while engaged in<lb/> their
                    noble cause, and well they may be happy. Busy<lb/> fingers were flying, until

                    willing and ready<lb/> to "shoulder arms." I could never stay at home<lb/> while

                <p> I received your gift by the kindness of <abbr expan="Captain">Capt,</abbr><lb/>
                    Wood. I was very thankful for it, you must hurry<lb/> and come home (guess you

                    over two weeks has elapsed since I heard from<lb/>

                    ambrotype. I love to look at the latter dearest, because<lb/> it reminds me so

                <p> Would that I could be with you dear and be a<lb/> sharer of the sufferings you
                    endure, but I have wished<lb/> that often enough to realize that it is
                    useless.<lb/>
                </p>

                <p> I have not heard from Hallie for some time, the<lb/> last he wrote, he was very
                    anxious to take the <orig reg="field">filed</orig><lb/> and wished to go to <name
                        type="place">Richmond</name>. He is still<lb/> acting as provost marshall
                        over <name type="place">Cumberland</name>.<lb/>
                </p>

                <p> I trust he will not be required to go there.<lb/> Perhaps I do wrong in wishing
                    him not to go<lb/> but when I consult my own feelings I can not<lb/> help it.
                    Dora is waiting for me to go down<lb/> with her and I must close write very often<lb/>
