                    <p>Sister Dora was the daughter of the Rev. <lb/> Mark Pattison, rector of
                        Hauxwell, Yorkshire, <lb/> England. Her name was <hi rend="small-caps"
                            >Dorothy <reg orig="Wynd-|Low">WyndLow</reg>
                            <lb/> Pattison;</hi> but when she joined a Protestant <lb/> sisterhood,
                        who called themselves "Good <reg orig="Samari-|tans">Samaritans</reg>,"
                        <lb/> because they devoted their lives to various <lb/> works of mercy, she
                        became known as Sister Dora. <lb/> I will introduce Miss Pattison to the
                        reader as she <lb/> appeared in the year 1852, at which date she was <lb/>
                        twenty years of age.</p>
                    <p>As described by her biographer,<ref target="n4.1" n="1">*</ref>

                        then <lb/>
                        <pb n="89"/> a young lady of remarkable personal beauty. Her <lb/> splendid
                        figure was tall, slender, and uncommonly <lb/> graceful. Her features were
                        nearly perfect in their <lb/> regularity. Her unusually high and wide
                        forehead <lb/> indicated the possession of superior mental <reg
                            orig="quali-|ties">qualities</reg>. <lb/> Her mouth was small when its
                        full, red lips <lb/> were closed, but quite wide when she spoke or <lb/>
                        laughed, and in its corners there lay a half-concealed <lb/> expression of
                        fun. Her brilliant dark-brown eyes <lb/> twinkled in "merry sympathy" with
                        her lips. Her <lb/> head was covered with "dark, tightly curling, brown
                        <lb/> hair." To these attractions she added a delicate <lb/> and beautiful
                        complexion, and she was, says Miss <lb/> Lonsdale, "a fascinating creature
                        to look upon." <lb/> Her courteous manners and gentle speech <reg

                        <lb/> of her home. By many she was often <lb/> described as "a real

                        <lb/> and dignity.</p>
                    <p>Such was Miss Dorothy Pattison at twenty. Her <lb/> life up to this period
                        had been spent in her father's <lb/> rectory, under external conditions
