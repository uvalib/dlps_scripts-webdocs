                    present.</p>

                <p>The Board adopted the following motion permitting it to meet in Executive Session
                    under the terms of the Virginia Freedom of Information Act:</p>

                <p>That the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia go into Executive
                    Session to discuss hedge investing the Endowment against the risk of market
                    correction where competition and bargaining is involved, and where public
                    disclosure at this time would adversely affect the University's financial
                    interest; and to review the performance and present and future assignments of
                    senior University administrators and related fund-raising expectations to
                    finance University operations, as provided for in Section 2.1-344 (A)(1), (6),
                    and (8) of the <hi rend="underline">Code of Virginia</hi>.</p>

                <p>The Board went into Executive Session at 10:15 a.m. and resumed in Open Session
                    at 11:05.</p>

                <pb n="5755"/>

                <p>On motion, the Board adopted the following resolution expressing its support of
                    proposed legislation in the General Assembly which would facilitate the
                    University's handling of its investments:</p>

                <p>RESOLVED that the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia endorses its
                    administration's request to the Governor and the General Assembly to amend
                    Section 23.76-1, Investment of Endowment Funds, of the <hi rend="underline">Code
                        of Virginia</hi>, to permit investments in securities and financial
                    transactions to protect its endowment.</p>

                <p>The President then made general introductory comments on the Agenda, which was to
                    follow in Executive Session.</p>
                <p>The Board resumed in Executive Session at 11:10 a.m. and continued to 5:00 p.m.,
                    when it once more met in Open Session and, on motion, adjourned.</p>

                    January 22, 2000 a roll call vote was taken immediately following an executive

                    (1) only public business matters lawfully exempted were discussed in closed
                    session; and (2) only public business matters identified in the public motion by
                    which the executive or closed meeting were discussed. In accordance with the
                    law, any member of the public body who believes that there was a departure from
                    the foregoing shall so state prior to the vote indicating "the substance of the
