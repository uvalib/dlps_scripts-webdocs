                <p>Addie tells Charlie that she is a free spirit. She encourages Charlie to
                    accompany her brother on a home visit. She tells how she maneuvers in her
                    hometown to conceal her affection for Charlie. In her youth, she explains, she
                    felt she should not be loved, and she tells Charlie what she thinks is her true
                    nature. </p>

                    they were as free as birds. Oh, anything<lb/> for me but sitting in the house
                    so<lb/> prim and formal saying just such<lb/> words, as if they had
                    memorized<lb/> them, and if you chance to say anything<lb/>
                    <pb n="2" entity="DSSR_000000766_0052"/> else, blush as if you<lb/> had been

                    darling I believe<lb/> human beings wander as far from<lb/> nature as from God.
                    But you, will<lb/> say is this from <name type="sender">Addie</name>, such a <orig

                    hope thus that hope will rise soon.<lb/> I saw <name type="person">Mrs.
                    Benton</name> at a donations<lb/> party last tuesday evening, and judge of<lb/>
                    my surprise when she told me that, her<lb/> husband <orig reg="received"
                    >recieved</orig> a letter from <name type="recipient">Charlie<lb/> Tenney</name>.
                    She told me that she heard<lb/> from Hal, I asked her, how she heard<lb/>
                </p>

                    <pb n="3" entity="DSSR_000000766_0053"/> She replied that they <orig

                    presume I looked the surprise<lb/> which I felt. Ah, indeed, I exclaimed,
                    &ldquo;Yes, do<lb/> you know him?"&rdquo; she asked perceieving my
                    astonishment<lb/> &ldquo;slightly&rdquo; I replied &ldquo;When you
                    write send my kind<lb/> regards&rdquo; Such was the short conversation
                    between<lb/> us But oh, how I longed to clasp that letter<lb/> to my heart and
                    read its contents, but <hi rend="underline">pride</hi><lb/> came to my relief,
                    and I was fearful of<lb/> betraying my interest in you, dear <name
                        type="recipient">Charlie</name><lb/>
                </p>
                <p> Can not you read my character in that short<lb/> conversation my darling? <orig

                    few trifling<lb/> remarks would put away such a pleasure?<lb/>
                </p>
                <p> Such you <hi rend="underline">may</hi> always find me to be,<lb/> even if <name
                        type="person">Hallie</name> wished me to throw away the nearest<lb/> friend
                    I possessed. I have no<del hand="h1">[unclear]</del> doubt but<lb/> that I
                    should do it, Dear <name type="recipient">Charlie</name>, it is no<lb/> vain talk
                    when I say I would die for <name type="person">Hal</name><lb/> for if I had a
                    thousand lives I would willingly<lb/> give them all for him. I have been
                    writing<lb/> to him today in preference to you, he will<lb/> doubtless tell you
                    what I wrote<lb/>
                </p>
                <p> I wish you to know me before you <hi rend="underline">love</hi><lb/> me for you
                    know not what a girl I am<lb/> My nearest friends call me
                    &ldquo;strange&rdquo; &ldquo;unfathomable&rdquo;<lb/> Those who
                    have always had the care of me seem<lb/> to know as much of me as stangers, I think<lb/>
                    <name type="person">Hallie</name> knows me better than any living<lb/> creature,
                    for to him I can open my heart<lb/> freely and fully. When I first began<lb/> to
                    notice what an interest you took in the<lb/> wayward girl, your correspondent, I
                    thought<lb/> it wrong and would exclaim, <hi rend="underline">he must not love</hi><lb/>
                     <hi rend="underline">me</hi>. I had been so used to the<lb/> appellations of
                    &ldquo;a queer girl&rdquo; &rdquo;strange child&rdquo; so<lb/>
                    that I had imagined it wicked for any<lb/> one to love me. Even when a little
                    child I<lb/> remember of being called a &ldquo;cold and heart-<lb/> less
                    child&rdquo; when I so much craved genial<lb/> love and sympathy Dear <name
                        type="recipient">Charlie</name>, those I do<lb/> love, I almost idolize. But
                    perhaps you will<lb/> call me a perfect egotist. Perhaps I am<lb/>
                    <pb n="4" entity="DSSR_000000766_0054"/> but I write just as I feel. I should
                    not<lb/> write thus but you ask me to &ldquo;allow you<lb/> to love
                    me&rdquo; and I wished to inform you<lb/> of just the woman you wish to
                    love, If<lb/> you <hi rend="underline">can</hi> love this &ldquo;strange
