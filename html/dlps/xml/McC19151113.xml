            <salute>
            Dear Marcelle:
            </salute></opener>
        		
        		<p>
            Well, I have some news
            about my shift to Avord.  My 
            friend Thierry - Delanone has fallen
            ill with dipheria [diphtheria], and the Change
            of Ministry has ousted the gentleman
            we were counting on.  Tant pis. [sic]
            Oh well, I now have a new
            line open direct to the ear of
            that distinguished and famous
            man of arms, <unclear>ycleft [sp?]</unclear> General
            Galleinie, or how ever you spell
            him, and so I’m waiting for
            results there.  Failing in the
            Avord wish I’ll go to Pau.
            I may go to Paris and wait 
            around putting in a personal
            appeal now and then, which
            ought to speed things up.
            </p><p>
            Thanks for your 
            complimentary remarks avent the
            Article in “Outlook”<unclear>[.]</unclear>  Glad it
            pleased  you.  Some high official
            read it someplace and sat up
            and asked himself about the
            blooming section.  It got action,
            and no less an individual
            that the right honorable Gaudet
            (over)
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0204" n="[p.2]"/>
            
            came breezing out and got off
            the usual “bunk” about
            Liberty, Civilization and Lafayette.
            They’re smearing it on these
            days.
            </p><p>
            I’ve no more news save to
            announce the arrival of a 
            fellow named Pottle who is
            a wonder.  A writes who hails
            from the Lake Como gang.  One
            of the best fellows I ever met.
            That, and the fact that I
            have at last queered myself
            permanently with my family
            constitutes the news to date.
            For one thing they won’t stand
            for my attitude toward the
            States and for another because I
            won’t go home and help 
            out during the hard times
            prevailing.  The last attempt to
            get me back consisted in an
            offer from my brother in law
            of a job that would pay me
            five thousand a year if I 
            made good.  I turned it down
            and told them to accept
            things as they were or
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0205" n="[p.3]"/>
            
            to stop writing.  I know I’m
            wrong, and mean, and a 
            slob, and everything else,
            but I happen to be constituted 
            that way and I just as well
            be frank about it.
            </p><p>
            When do you plan that
            vacation of yours?  I’m hoping
            Ned will be back around the
            1st of December and if so I
            shall shortly after that pack 
            up my tooth brush and
            hie [sic] me to La Belle Paris
            en route to Avord or Pau.
            Hope I land while your vacation
            is still on.  We can have
            a couple afternoons floating
            around someplace if you
            are willing to honor me
            with the pleasure of your
            extremely pleasant company.
            </p><p>
            Do let me know how 
            you are getting on, Mlle. Marcelle 
            Guerin of Paris, New York and the
            A.A.  Paul’s wedding is put
            off until end of the war.  Don’t 
            give him a suspicion of what
            I’ve said will you?
            </p>
