            <p>
            Your welcome letter was received last
            night with an immense amount of
            pleasure.
            </p><p>
            Of course you must not ask for any
            days off on my account if a leave would
            jeopardize your hold on a cart.  Should
            you miss out on the more restful work
            you are doing, because you generously took
            a leave to add to my happiness, the
            pleasure I would derive from the added
            moments with you would be far outweighed
            by the profound regret I would feel
            at having been the cause of such a
            deplorable turn of events.  You’re a 
            dear, sweet girl  to think of bothering
            yourself about me at all.
            </p><p>
            I now expect to run on the following 
            schedule.  I will leave Nancy at 7.30 A.M.
            and arrive in Paris during the afternoon.
            The day being Wednesday the 15th.  I am
            going to put up at the same place
            Paul lives and will get ahold [sic] of you
            either that day or the next.  I left 
            Paris the 17th of April, and so it will
            be just two days short of five months
            since I’ve been at the front.  It
            doesn’t seem as if time should pass
            so quickly.
            </p><p>
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0174"/>

            I’ll have some more information to give
            you about the tent section when I
            see you.  Fool tent section.  I suppose you’ve
            a wealth of gossip <unclear>anent [sp?]</unclear> the A.A.
            </p><p>
            Heavens, aren’t you glad you’re French
            and can be proud of your country?
            You’ve no idea how miserable I’ve felt
            at the disgraceful exhibition the
            country I was born and raised in
            had made of itself.  Its sickening
            in the extreme.  Oh well, we can talk
            it all over when I see you and thats [sic]
            only about a short week off.  And
            Oh I shall be so glad to see 
            you!
            </p>
