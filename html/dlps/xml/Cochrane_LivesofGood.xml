<head><hi rend="bold">PREFACE.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">New</hi> books of biography are, on the face of things, <lb/>
an absolute necessity. We need not forget our <lb/>
old heroes, our ancient ideals, and yet we may well <lb/>
feel that to learn something about the trials and <lb/>
struggles, the methods of work, and the ultimate <lb/>
triumphs of those who have but recently passed <lb/>
away, or who are still among us, may be more <reg orig="help-|ful">helpful</reg> <lb/>
to us in our own place. The roads of life, so to <lb/>
speak, have not been changed since these trod them: <lb/>
we can trace their very footprints. Above all, they <lb/>
prove to us that our century is not necessarily the <lb/>
ignoble time which the Present always seems to <lb/>
some, but that all the materials of romance and <lb/>
heroism lie around us still, waiting only for the soul <lb/>
worthy of moulding them to right ends. If it be <lb/>
true, as it undoubtedly is, that <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>The song that nerves a nation's heart</l>
<l>Is in itself a deed,</l>
</lg></q>
it is equally sure that it is a good work to dissipate <lb/>
the obscurity which easily gathers round some of <lb/>
the noblest lives, to prolong their influence beyond <lb/>
<pb n="2" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0015"/>
the years of mortality, and to take the shining light <lb/>
of love and labour, which once, perhaps, shone in <lb/>
but a little circle of place or time, and set it on a <lb/>
hill, a beacon for thousands who may pass its way. <lb/>
A good life is the best of sermons: it is not hard to <lb/>
understand, nor easy to forget, and it is never too <lb/>
long! The lives here presented include the lofty <lb/>
and the lowly, culled from many departments of <lb/>
life, ranging from Queen Victoria down to many <lb/>
humble yet noble workers for the well-being of <lb/>
the race. With these words, we commend our book <lb/>
of biographies of good and great women to its <lb/>
readers.</p>

<head><hi rend="bold">QUEEN VICTORIA.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">In</hi> the year 1819 the family outlook of the <lb/>
British royal house was not a very bright <lb/>
one. The old king, George III., was <reg orig="linger-|ing">lingering</reg> <lb/>
on in deep seclusion, a very pathetic figure, blind <lb/>
and imbecile. His son the Prince Regent, afterwards <lb/>
George IV., had not done honour to his position, nor <lb/>
brought happiness to any connected with him. Most <lb/>
of the other princes were elderly men and childless&mdash; <lb/>
and the Prince Regent's only daughter, the Princess <lb/>
Charlotte, on whom the hopes of the nation had <lb/>
rested, and whose marriage had raised those hopes <lb/>
to enthusiasm, was newly laid in her premature <lb/>
grave.</p>
<pb n="8" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0021"/>
<p>But almost immediately after Princess Charlotte's <lb/>
death, the king's second and third sons, the Dukes <lb/>
of Clarence and Kent, had married. Of the Duke <lb/>
of Clarence we need say little more. He and his <lb/>
consort eventually reigned as William IV. and Queen <lb/>
Adelaide, and they had two or three children who <lb/>
died in earliest infancy, and did not further <reg orig="com-|plicate">complicate</reg> <lb/>
the succession to the crown.</p>
<p>The Duke of Kent married the widowed Princess <lb/>
of Leiningen, already the mother of a son and a <lb/>
daughter by her first husband. The royal pair lived <lb/>
in Germany until the birth of a child was expected, <lb/>
when the duke, at first, thought of taking a house <lb/>
in Lanarkshire&mdash;which would have made Queen <lb/>
Victoria by birth a Scotchwoman. Eventually, the <lb/>
Duke and Duchess of Kent took up their abode in <lb/>
Kensington Palace.</p>
<p>On the 24th May 1819, their daughter was born <lb/>
&mdash;and named Alexandrina Victoria, after the <reg orig="reign-|ing">reigning</reg> <lb/>
Emperor of Russia and the Duchess of Kent. <lb/>
George IV. had wished the name of Georgiana; the <lb/>
Duke of Kent, that of Elizabeth. The little one was <lb/>
the first of the British royal house to receive the <lb/>
benefits of Jenner's discovery of vaccination.</p>
<p>This was the child destined to be the <reg orig="Empress-|Queen">EmpressQueen</reg>, <lb/>
on whose dominion the sun never sets, though <lb/>
so remote did such a destiny then seem, owing to the <lb/>
possibilities of the Regent's life, and of children <lb/>
being born to the Duke of Clarence, that in some <lb/>
courtly biographies of George III. there is no <lb/>
mention made of the birth of the little princess; <lb/>
and even in their accounts of the death of her father <lb/>
the Duke of Kent, seven months afterwards <lb/>
<pb n="9" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0022"/>
&lpar;January 1820&rpar;, they do not deem it necessary to <lb/>
state that he left a daughter behind him, though he, <lb/>
poor man, had never had any doubts of her future <lb/>
importance, and had been in the habit of showing his <lb/>
baby, with the introduction, 'Look at her well, for <lb/>
she will be Queen of England.'</p>
<p>The position of the widowed Duchess of Kent, <lb/>
a stranger in a foreign country, was rather sad and <lb/>
lonely. It was further complicated by narrowness <lb/>
of means. The old king, her father-in-law, died soon <lb/>
after her husband, and George IV. did not prove <lb/>
a generous or considerate relative. But the duchess <lb/>
was a woman of sense and spirit. Instead of <reg orig="yield-|ing">yielding</reg> <lb/>
to any natural impulse to retire to simple <reg orig="domes-|ticities">domesticities</reg> <lb/>
and economies in Germany, she resolved that <lb/>
her little English princess should have an English <lb/>
rearing. She found a firm friend and upholder in <lb/>
her brother Leopold, the widower of Princess <reg orig="Char-|lotte">Charlotte</reg>, <lb/>
and afterwards King of the Belgians. The <lb/>
little princess was brought up quietly and wisely at <lb/>
Kensington and Claremont. There are those who <lb/>
can remember her, a pretty infant, riding on her <lb/>
sleek donkey &lpar;a gift from her uncle the Duke of <lb/>
York&rpar; in Kensington Gardens. She used to be seen, <lb/>
in a large straw hat and a white cotton frock, <lb/>
watering the plants under the palace windows, and <lb/>
often took breakfast with her mother on the lawn <lb/>
there. There are playful stories told of those happy <lb/>
early days. The little princess was very fond of <lb/>
music, listening, as one spell-bound, when first she <lb/>
heard some of Beethoven's glorious compositions. <lb/>
But like most children, she rebelled against the <lb/>
drudgery of scales and finger exercises, and on being <lb/>
<pb n="10" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0023"/>
told that there is 'no royal road to music,' she <lb/>
sportively locked the piano and announced that <lb/>
'the royal road is never to take a lesson till you feel <lb/>
disposed.'</p>
<p>In 1831, when the princess was twelve years old, <lb/>
Fr&auml;ulein Lehzen, a German lady, became her <reg orig="gover-|ness">governess</reg>. <lb/>
In her home letters she records that 'the <lb/>
princess received her in a pretty childlike way,' <lb/>
and describes her as 'not tall, but very pretty; has <lb/>
dark brown hair, beautiful brown eyes, and a mouth <lb/>
which, though not tiny, is very good tempered and <lb/>
pleasant; very fine teeth, a small but graceful figure, <lb/>
and a very small foot. She was dressed in white <lb/>
muslin with a coral necklet.' The domestic life was <lb/>
that of any other well-regulated and happy family. <lb/>
The princess shared her governess's bedroom. They <lb/>
all took their meals together at a round table. <lb/>
When they did not go to church, the duchess read a <lb/>
sermon aloud and commented pleasantly on it. Nor <lb/>
are there lacking traces of strict and chastening <lb/>
discipline. The princess had been early taught that <lb/>
there are good habits and duties in the management <lb/>
of money. When she was buying toys at Tunbridge <lb/>
Wells, her wishes outran her little purse, and the <lb/>
box for which she could not pay was not carried <lb/>
away on credit, but set aside for her to fetch away <lb/>
when the next quarter-day would renew her <reg orig="allow-|ance">allowance</reg>. <lb/>
Fr&auml;ulein Lehzen says, 'The duchess wished <lb/>
that when she and the princess drove out, I should <lb/>
sit by her side, and the princess at the back. Several <lb/>
times I could not prevent it, but at last she has given <lb/>
in, and says on such occasions with a laugh to her <lb/>
daughter: "Sit by me, since Fr&auml;ulein Lehzen wishes <lb/>
<pb n="11" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0024"/>
it to be so." But,' says the governess, 'I do not <lb/>
hesitate to remark to the little one, whom I am most <lb/>
anxious not to spoil, that this consideration is not on <lb/>
her account, because she is still a child, but that my <lb/>
respect for her mother disposes me to decline the <lb/>
seat.'</p>
<p>The Duchess of Kent took her daughter to visit <lb/>
many of the chief cities, cathedrals, and other places <lb/>
of interest in the British Isles. Her first public act <lb/>
was to present the colours to a regiment of foot <lb/>
at Plymouth. An American writer has recorded that <lb/>
he saw the widowed lady and her little girl in the <lb/>
churchyard of Brading, in the Isle of Wight. They <lb/>
were seated near the grave of the heroine of a 'short <lb/>
and simple annal of the poor'&mdash;the <hi rend="italic">Dairyman's <lb/>
Daughter,</hi> whose story, as told by the Rev. Legh <lb/>
Richmond, had a great popularity at the time. The <lb/>
duchess was reading from a volume she carried <lb/>
&lpar;probably that one&rpar;, and the little princess's soft eyes <lb/>
were tearful.</p>
<p>Her wise mother withheld her from the pomp and <lb/>
circumstance of the court. She was not even allowed <lb/>
to be present at the coronation of her uncle, the Duke <lb/>
of Clarence, when he ascended the throne as William <lb/>
IV. He could not understand such reticence, and <lb/>
was annoyed by it, and expressed his annoyance <lb/>
angrily. But his consort, good Queen Adelaide, was <lb/>
always kind, for even when she lost all her own little <lb/>
ones, she could be generous enough to say to the <lb/>
Duchess of Kent, 'My children are dead, but yours <lb/>
lives, and she is mine too.'</p>
<p>At the time of Fr&auml;ulein Lehzen's arrival in <lb/>
England, the princess's difficult position was growing <lb/>
<pb n="12" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0025"/>
clearer. George IV. had died childless. All the <lb/>
children of William IV. were dead, and the advent <lb/>
of more was improbable. The Princess Victoria <lb/>
was the heiress of England. To Fr&auml;ulein Lehzen <lb/>
was intrusted the task of explaining to her pupil the <lb/>
genealogical table of the royal house.</p>
<p>'I see,' she said timidly, 'that I stand nearer the <lb/>
throne than I believed.'</p>
<p>'It is so,' said the governess.</p>
<p>'Many a child,' observed the princess thoughtfully, <lb/>
'would be proud in my place. But they do not <lb/>
know the difficulties. It is a brilliant lot, but one of <lb/>
grave responsibility.' And putting her hand on her <lb/>
governess's she said solemnly, <hi rend="italic">'I will be good.</hi> Let <lb/>
that be recorded as among royal vows that have been <lb/>
faithfully fulfilled.</p>
<p>When, forty years after, the Queen recorded the <lb/>
death of her aged governess, she does so, with the <lb/>
words, 'I worshipped her: at the same time I had <lb/>
unbounded respect for her.'</p>
<p>The first great event in the young princess's life, <lb/>
and that which was destined to colour it all for her <lb/>
good and happiness, was her first meeting in 1836, <lb/>
with her cousin, her mother's nephew, the young <lb/>
Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg. That visit was of <lb/>
about a month's duration, and from the beginning <lb/>
the attraction was mutual. But as an attraction it <lb/>
had to remain for a while, for the princess was only <lb/>
seventeen, and the education of the prince was still <lb/>
incomplete, so that he was still on his student travels, <lb/>
collecting flowers and views and autographs for the <lb/>
sweet maiden in England, when in 1837, news <lb/>
reached him that by the death of William IV. she <lb/>
<pb n="13" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0026"/>
had attained her great dignity, and was proclaimed <lb/>
queen.</p>
<p>On the morning when the king died, the new <lb/>
queen was summoned hastily from her bedroom to <lb/>
meet her ministers, and came among them, a shawl <lb/>
wrapped round her, with tearful eyes and trembling <lb/>
lips. The great Duke of Wellington declared that he <lb/>
could not have desired a daughter of his own to <lb/>
play her part better than did the young queen. She <lb/>
seemed 'awed but not daunted.' Nor was the gentler <lb/>
womanly side of life neglected. She wrote at once to <lb/>
the widowed Queen Adelaide, begging her, in all her <lb/>
arrangements, to consult nothing but her own health <lb/>
and convenience, and to remain at Windsor just as <lb/>
long as she pleased. And on the superscription of <lb/>
that letter, she refused to give her widowed aunt her <lb/>
new style of 'Queen Dowager.' 'I am quite aware of <lb/>
Her Majesty's altered position,' she said, 'but I will <lb/>
not be the first person to remind her of it.' And on <lb/>
the evening of the king's funeral, a sick girl, daughter <lb/>
of an old servant of the Duke of Kent, to whom the <lb/>
duchess and the princess had been accustomed to <lb/>
show kindness, received from 'Queen Victoria,' a gift <lb/>
of the Psalms of David, with a marker worked by <lb/>
the royal hands, and placed in the forty-first psalm.</p>
<p>The coronation took place in Westminster Abbey <lb/>
on June 28, 1838, and has been vividly described <lb/>
by many pens. We are told of the glow of purple, <lb/>
of the acclamations of the crowd, and the chorus of <lb/>
Westminster scholars, of the flash of diamonds as the <lb/>
assembled peeresses assumed their coronets when the <lb/>
crown was placed on the head of the young queen. <lb/>
But we best like the touch of womanly solicitude and <lb/>
<pb n="14" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0027"/>
helpfulness, with which Her Majesty made a hasty <lb/>
movement forward as an aged peer, Lord Rolle, <lb/>
tripped over his robes, and stumbled on the steps of <lb/>
the throne. As she left the Abbey, 'the tender <reg orig="pale-|ness">paleness</reg> <lb/>
that had overspread her fair face on her entrance <lb/>
had yielded to a glow of rosy celestial red.'</p>
<p>Reasons of state and court etiquette required the <lb/>
Duchess of Kent to retire from the constant <reg orig="com-|panionship">companionship</reg> <lb/>
of her daughter, lest she should be <reg orig="sus-|pected">suspected</reg> <lb/>
of undue influence over her. The young <lb/>
Queen of England had entered upon a time of moral <lb/>
trial. Many of those who had been ready to applaud <lb/>
her were found equally ready to criticise her. Her <lb/>
mother's natural pangs of settling down into their <lb/>
new relationship were magnified into symptoms of <lb/>
the Queen's coldness and self-will. It was said that <lb/>
she 'began to exhibit slight signs of a peremptory <lb/>
disposition.' Despite her strong attraction to her <lb/>
cousin Albert, she expressed a determination not to <lb/>
think of marriage for a time. The sudden change <lb/>
from her quiet, girlish life in Kensington to the <lb/>
power and independence of a great queen, standing <lb/>
'in that fierce light which beats upon a throne,' <lb/>
would have excused far greater wilfulness and <lb/>
frivolity than Victoria ever showed. For a moment <lb/>
she was caught in political partialities and enmeshed <lb/>
in court cabals, and though she speedily righted <lb/>
herself, her recollections of this period of her life <lb/>
are clearly tinged with an innocent and candid <lb/>
regret, which makes us but love her the more. Her <lb/>
Majesty decides that 'a worse school for a young girl, <lb/>
or one more detrimental to all natural feelings and <lb/>
affections, cannot well be imagined.' Perhaps it was <lb/>
<pb n="15" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0028"/>
an experience which she needed to convince her fully <lb/>
of the value and blessedness of the true domesticity <lb/>
which was soon to be hers.</p>
<p>If for a while the Queen thus drew back from any <lb/>
thought of marriage with the cousin whom, <reg orig="neverthe-|less">nevertheless</reg>, <lb/>
she owned to be 'fascinating,' that cousin on his <lb/>
side was not one of those of whom it may be said: <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>He either fears his fate too much</l>
<l rend="indent">Or his deserts are small</l>
<l>That dares not put it to the touch,</l>
<l rend="indent">To gain or lose it all.</l>
</lg></q>
'I am ready,' he said, 'to submit to delay, if I <lb/>
have only some certain assurance to go upon. But <lb/>
if, after waiting, perhaps for three years, I should <lb/>
find that the Queen no longer desired the marriage, <lb/>
it would place me in a ridiculous position, and would, <lb/>
to a certain extent, ruin all my prospects for the <lb/>
future.'</p>
<p>Love proved stronger than girlish pride and <reg orig="in-|dependence">independence</reg>. <lb/>
The woman was greater than the <lb/>
queen. The young pair met again on the 10th <lb/>
October 1839, and on the 14th of the same month <lb/>
the Queen communicated the welcome news of her <lb/>
approaching marriage to her prime-minister. Her <lb/>
best friends were all delighted with the news.</p>
<p>Nowhere does the genuine unselfishness and sweet <lb/>
womanliness of the Queen show more than in her <lb/>
record of those days. She did not, like too many <lb/>
brides, think of herself as the only, or even the <reg orig="prin-|cipal">principal</reg> <lb/>
person to be considered. She did not grudge <lb/>
that her bridegroom's heart should feel the strength <lb/>
of former ties. 'The sacrifice,' in her eyes, was all <lb/>
on his side, though he would not admit that. He <lb/>
<pb n="16" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0029"/>
had to leave his brother, his home, his dear native <lb/>
land. He, on his side, could ask, 'What am I, that <lb/>
such happiness should be mine?' But her one <lb/>
thought was, 'God grant that I may be the happy <lb/>
person&mdash;the <hi rend="italic">most</hi> happy person, to make this dearest, <lb/>
blessed being happy and contented.'</p>
<p>When on the 23d of November, the young queen <lb/>
had to tell her love tale to her eighty privy <lb/>
councillors, she wore upon her slender wrist a <reg orig="brace-|let">bracelet</reg> <lb/>
with the prince's portrait, 'which seemed,' she <lb/>
says, 'to give her courage.' On the 16th of January <lb/>
1840, she had to announce her approaching marriage <lb/>
to the Houses of Parliament with a view to the <lb/>
necessary settlement of business formalities.</p>
<p>The marriage itself took place on 10th February <lb/>
1840 in the Chapel Royal, St James's Palace. It was <lb/>
a cold cheerless morning, but the sun burst forth just <lb/>
as the Queen entered the chapel. One of the <reg orig="ladies-|in-waiting">ladiesin-waiting</reg> <lb/>
wrote to her family that 'the Queen's look <lb/>
and manner were very pleasing: her eyes much <lb/>
swollen with tears, but great happiness in her <lb/>
countenance: and her look of confidence and comfort <lb/>
at the prince when they walked away as man and <lb/>
wife, was very pleasing to see.' And this sympathetic <lb/>
observer adds: 'Such a new thing for her to <hi rend="italic">dare</hi> to <lb/>
be <hi rend="italic">unguarded</hi> with anybody; and with her frank <lb/>
and fearless nature, the restraints she has hitherto <lb/>
been under, from one reason or another, with <reg orig="every-|body">everybody</reg>, <lb/>
must have been most painful.'</p>
<p>The royal pair spent three days of honeymoon at <lb/>
Windsor, and then, in the discharge of public duty, <lb/>
they returned to London.</p>
<p>So began the happy years of peaceful married life. <lb/>
<pb n="17" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0030"/>
The prince liked early hours and country pleasures, <lb/>
and the Queen, like a loyal wife, not merely <reg orig="con-|sented">consented</reg> <lb/>
to his tastes, but made them absolutely her <lb/>
own. Before she had been married a year, she <lb/>
made the naive pretty confession that 'formerly <lb/>
I was too happy to go to London and wretched <lb/>
to leave it, and now, since the blessed hour of <lb/>
my marriage, and still more since the summer, <lb/>
I dislike and am unhappy to leave the country, <lb/>
and would be content and happy never to go <lb/>
to town;' adding ingenuously, 'the solid pleasures <lb/>
of a peaceful, quiet, yet merry life in the country, <lb/>
with my inestimable husband and friend, my all <lb/>
in all, are far more durable than the <reg orig="amuse-|ments">amusements</reg> <lb/>
of London, though we don't despise or dislike <lb/>
them sometimes.'</p>
<p>They took breakfast at nine: they had been later <lb/>
at first &lpar;'which was the Queen's fault'&rpar;, then they <lb/>
went through details of routine business, and etched <lb/>
or played till luncheon, after which the Queen had a <lb/>
daily interview with Lord Melbourne &lpar;the <reg orig="prime-|minister">primeminister</reg> <lb/>
of the period&rpar;. Then they drove, walked <lb/>
or rode, dined at eight o'clock, and had pleasant <lb/>
social circles afterwards, which were broken up before <lb/>
midnight. Both were fond of art and music. Indeed <lb/>
the Prince Consort gave the first impulse to that <lb/>
study of classical music which has since become so <lb/>
universal. Mendelssohn himself praised the Queen's <lb/>
singing, though without flattering blindness to its <lb/>
faults and shortcomings. And the brightness of life <lb/>
was all the brighter because it flowed over a <reg orig="sub-|stratum">substratum</reg> <lb/>
of seriousness and solemnity. The first time <lb/>
that the Queen and her husband partook of Holy <lb/>
<pb n="18" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0031"/>
Communion together, they spent the preceding <reg orig="even-|ing&mdash;the">evening&mdash;the</reg> <lb/>
vigil of Easter&mdash;in retirement, occupied <lb/>
with good German books, and soothed and elevated <lb/>
by Mozart's music.</p>
<p>The Princess Royal was born on the 21st <reg orig="Novem-|ber">November</reg> <lb/>
1840. And the royal mother, fondly tended by <lb/>
her husband, made a speedy and happy recovery. <lb/>
After the birth of the Prince of Wales on November <lb/>
9, 1841, the little family circle rapidly increased, and <lb/>
with it the parents' sense of responsibility. 'A <lb/>
man's education begins the first day of his life,' said <lb/>
the prince's tried friend, the wise Baron Stockmar, <lb/>
and the Queen felt it 'a hard case' that the pressure <lb/>
of public business prevented her from being always <lb/>
with her little ones when they said their prayers. <lb/>
Her views on religious training are as follows:</p>
<p>'I am quite clear that children should be taught <lb/>
to have great reverence for God and for religion, but <lb/>
that they should have the feeling of devotion and <lb/>
love which our Heavenly Father encourages His <lb/>
earthly children to have for Him, and not one of fear <lb/>
and trembling; and that the thoughts of death and <lb/>
an after-life should not be presented in an alarming <lb/>
and forbidding view; and that they should be made <lb/>
to know, <hi rend="italic">as yet,</hi> no difference of creeds.'</p>
<p>Court gossips considered the Queen 'to be very <lb/>
fond of her children, but severe in her manner, and a <lb/>
strict disciplinarian in her family.' A nurse in the <lb/>
royal household informed Baron Bunsen that 'the <lb/>
children were kept very plain indeed: it was quite <lb/>
poor living&mdash;only a bit of roast meat, and perhaps a <lb/>
plain pudding.' Other servants have reported that <lb/>
the Queen would have made 'an admirable poor <lb/>
<pb entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0032"/>

</figure>
<pb entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0033"/>
<pb n="21" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0034"/>
man's wife.' We used to hear how the young <reg orig="prin-|cesses">princesses</reg> <lb/>
had to smooth out and roll up their bonnet <lb/>
strings. By these trifling side-lights we discern a <lb/>
vigorous, wholesome regime, striving to counteract <lb/>
the enervating influences of rank and power, and <lb/>
their attendant flattery and self-indulgence. 'One <lb/>
of the main principles observed in the education of <lb/>
the royal children was this&mdash;that though they <lb/>
received the best training, of body and mind, to fit <lb/>
them for the high position they would eventually <lb/>
have to fill, they should in no wise come in contact <lb/>
with the actual court life. The children were <lb/>
scarcely known to the Queen's ladies-in-waiting, as <lb/>
they only now and then made their appearance for a <lb/>
moment after dinner at dessert, or accompanied their <lb/>
parents out driving. The care of them was <reg orig="exclu-|sively">exclusively</reg> <lb/>
intrusted to persons who possessed the Queen <lb/>
and Prince Consort's entire confidence, and with <lb/>
whom they could at all times communicate direct.'</p>
<p>The seaside villa of Osborne and the remote castle <lb/>
of Balmoral were the favourite homes of the royal <lb/>
household: the creations as it were, of their domestic <lb/>
love, and wrought with their own personalities, as <lb/>
statelier Windsor could never be. In the Swiss <lb/>
cottage at Osborne, with its museum, kitchen, <reg orig="store-|room">storeroom</reg>, <lb/>
and little gardens, the young people learned to <lb/>
do household work and understand the management <lb/>
of a small establishment. The parents were invited <lb/>
as guests, to enjoy the dishes which the princesses <lb/>
had prepared with their own hands, and there each <lb/>
child was free to follow the bent of its own <reg orig="indus-|trial">industrial</reg> <lb/>
inclination. In the Highlands, again, among <lb/>
the reserved and dignified Scottish peasantry, the <lb/>
<pb n="22" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0035"/>
children were encouraged to visit freely, to make <lb/>
themselves acquainted with the wants and feelings <lb/>
of the poor, and to regard them with an <reg orig="understand-|ing">understanding</reg> <lb/>
sympathy and affection.</p>
<p>In a brief sketch of the life of Queen Victoria, <lb/>
it is impossible to touch upon public and historical <lb/>
events, except as they serve to bring out some trait <lb/>
in her character. For her reign now covers half a <lb/>
century, in which the world has passed through many <lb/>
political and social convulsions, and has made rapid <lb/>
strides on the path of material, mechanical, and <lb/>
metaphysical development. The 'Eastern Questions,' <lb/>
in one form or another, has been a perennial difficulty <lb/>
of the Victorian epoch. The troubled state of <lb/>
European politics disturbed the earlier years of the <lb/>
reign. The marriage into which the young Queen <lb/>
of Spain was entrapped in 1846, by Louis-Philippe, <lb/>
in the hope of securing the succession to the Spanish <lb/>
crown to the issue of his own son, married to the <lb/>
Queen of Spain's younger sister, threatened to <reg orig="dis-|turb">disturb</reg> <lb/>
the friendly relations between England and <lb/>
France. Queen Victoria's affection for the King of <lb/>
the French did not blind her to the wrong which <lb/>
had been done to Queen Isabella, or to the evils <lb/>
which it must entail upon her. She wrote to her <lb/>
uncle, the King of the Belgians, 'I am unable to <lb/>
say a word in defence of one whom I had esteemed <lb/>
and respected. You may imagine what the whole of <lb/>
this makes me suffer. You cannot represent too <lb/>
strongly to the king and queen my indignation and <lb/>
my sorrow at what has been done.' Nor was her <lb/>
cordial feeling to the French royal family quite <lb/>
restored, until in 1849, the waves of revolution cast <lb/>
<pb n="23" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0036"/>
them upon the shores of England, as the Prince <lb/>
Consort expressed it 'like people shipwrecked.' Even <lb/>
then, she quite understood that a wide line must <lb/>
be drawn between personal sympathy and political <lb/>
support.</p>
<p>One most picturesque feature of the Queen's reign <lb/>
was the inauguration, in 1851, of that system of <lb/>
International Exhibitions which has infused a new <lb/>
and larger spirit into commerce, and whose influence <lb/>
as yet only begins to work. The idea came from <lb/>
the Prince Consort, and was carried out by his <lb/>
unfailing industry, energy, and perseverance. Sir <lb/>
Joseph Paxton's genius raised a Palace of Crystal in <lb/>
Hyde Park, inclosing within it some of the <reg orig="mag-|nificent">magnificent</reg> <lb/>
trees, few, if any, of which were destroyed <lb/>
by the undertaking. As Thackeray wrote: <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>A blazing arch of lucid glass,</l>
<l>Leaps like a fountain from the grass,</l>
<l rend="indent">To meet the sun.</l>
</lg></q>
The Queen took the greatest interest in the work, <lb/>
which she felt was her husband's. She visited it <lb/>
almost daily, entering into interested conversation <lb/>
with the manufacturers who had brought their wares <lb/>
for display. The building was opened on the 1st of <lb/>
May, which the Queen names in her diary as 'a day <lb/>
which makes my heart swell with pride and glory <lb/>
and thankfulness.' She dwells lovingly on 'the <lb/>
tremendous cheers, the joy expressed in every face,' <lb/>
adding '<hi rend="italic">we</hi> feel happy&mdash;so full of thankfulness. <lb/>
God is indeed our kind and merciful Father!'</p>
<p>In the year 1852, amid the anxieties consequent <lb/>
on the sudden assumption of imperial power <lb/>
<pb n="24" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0037"/>
by Louis Napoleon, late President of the French <lb/>
Republic, the Queen writes thus to her uncle King <lb/>
Leopold: 'I grow daily to dislike politics and <lb/>
business more and more. We women are not made <lb/>
for governing, and if we are good women, we must <lb/>
dislike these masculine occupations.'</p>
<p>It was about this time that unjust reports were <lb/>
circulated concerning the political influence of <lb/>
Prince Albert, who was represented as 'inimical to <lb/>
the progress of liberty throughout the world, and <lb/>
the friend of reactionary movements and absolute <lb/>
government.' When parliament was opened, the <lb/>
prince was completely vindicated, and his past <lb/>
services to the country, as the bosom counsellor <lb/>
of the sovereign, were made clear. The Queen <lb/>
naturally felt the pain of these calumnies more <lb/>
deeply than did the prince himself, but on the <lb/>
anniversary of her wedding day, she could write: <lb/>
'Trials we must have: but what are they if we are <lb/>
together!'</p>
<p>In 1854, the Eastern difficulties culminated in the <lb/>
Crimean war, when England, France, and Turkey <lb/>
combined against the aggressive menaces of Russia. <lb/>
The Queen and prince watched intently every <reg orig="move-|ment">movement</reg> <lb/>
of the tremendous drama. In the terrible <lb/>
winter of 1855, the Queen's thoughts were with <lb/>
her troops, suffering in the inclement weather, amid <lb/>
arrangements that proved miserably inadequate to <lb/>
their needs. With her own hands she made <reg orig="com-|forters">comforters</reg>, <lb/>
mittens, and other articles of clothing, for <lb/>
distribution among the soldiers, and she wrote to <lb/>
Lord Raglan that she 'had heard that their coffee <lb/>
was given to them green, instead of roasted, and <lb/>
<pb n="25" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0038"/>
some other things of this kind, which had distressed <lb/>
her, and she besought that they should be made as <lb/>
comfortable as circumstances can admit.' The little <lb/>
princes and princesses contributed their childish but <lb/>
very pretty drawings to an exhibition which was <lb/>
opened for the benefit of the soldiers' widows and <lb/>
children. As the disabled soldiers returned to this <lb/>
country, the Queen and the prince took the earliest <lb/>
opportunity of ascertaining by personal observation <lb/>
in what condition they were, and how they were <lb/>
cared for. And when the war was over, Miss <lb/>
Florence Nightingale, the soldier's nurse and friend, <lb/>
was an honoured guest in the royal family, 'putting <lb/>
before us,' writes the prince, 'all the defects of our <lb/>
present military hospital system and the reforms <lb/>
that are needed.'</p>
<p>Close upon the end of the Crimean war followed <lb/>
the outbreak of the great Indian Mutiny, which the <lb/>
Queen felt 'to be much more distressing than the <lb/>
Crimea, where there was glory and honourable <lb/>
warfare.' When the mutiny was quelled, nobody <lb/>
deprecated more than she did the rabid and <reg orig="indis-|criminate">indiscriminate</reg> <lb/>
vindictiveness with which a certain section <lb/>
of the English people desired to treat all the <reg orig="country-|men">countrymen</reg> <lb/>
of the military mutineers whose reported <reg orig="atro-|cities">atrocities</reg> <lb/>
had roused their indignation. The Queen <lb/>
wrote to Lord Canning that she shared 'his feelings <lb/>
of sorrow and indignation at the unchristian spirit <lb/>
shown towards Indians in general and towards <lb/>
sepoys without discrimination.&hellip; To the nation <lb/>
at large&mdash;to the peaceable inhabitants&mdash;to the many <lb/>
kind and friendly natives who have assisted us, <lb/>
sheltered the fugitives, and been faithful and true&mdash; <lb/>
<pb n="26" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0039"/>

there should be shown the greatest kindness. &hellip; <lb/>
The greatest wish on their Queen's part is to see <lb/>
them happy, contented, and flourishing.'</p>
<p>Meanwhile a domestic incident had made a great <lb/>
change in the royal family. The Princess Royal <lb/>
had become engaged to Prince Frederick-William of <lb/>
Prussia, and the marriage came off on the 25th of <lb/>
January 1858. It was the first break in the home <lb/>
circle. The Queen recorded it in her diary as 'the <lb/>
second most eventful day in my life as regards <lb/>
feelings.' Before the wedding, the Queen and her <lb/>
daughter were photographed together, but the <lb/>
Queen 'trembled so, that her likeness came out <lb/>
indistinct.' The correspondence between the mother <lb/>
and her daughter began and continued, close and <lb/>
confidential, full of trusting affection and solicitous <lb/>
wisdom.</p>
<p>On November 9, 1858, the Prince of Wales <lb/>
solemnised his eighteenth birthday. Mr Greville <lb/>
in his journal tells us that on that occasion the <lb/>
Queen wrote her son 'one of the most admirable <lb/>
letters that ever were penned.' She told him that <lb/>
he may have thought the rule they adopted for his <lb/>
education a severe one, but that his welfare was <lb/>
their only object, and well knowing to what <reg orig="seduc-|tions">seductions</reg> <lb/>
of flattery he would eventually be exposed, <lb/>
they wished to prepare and strengthen his mind <lb/>
against them, and that he must now consider himself <lb/>
his own master, and that they should never intrude <lb/>
any advice upon him, although always ready to counsel <lb/>
him whenever he thought fit to attend. This was <lb/>
a very long letter, which the prince received with a <lb/>
feeling that proved the wisdom which dictated it.</p>
<pb n="27" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0040"/>
<p>In 1860, while travelling with the Queen in <lb/>
Germany, the Prince Consort met with a severe <lb/>
carriage accident, his comparative escape from which <lb/>
left the Queen full of happy thanksgiving, though, <lb/>
as she herself says, 'when she feels most deeply, she <lb/>
always appears calmest.' But, she added, she 'could <lb/>
not rest without doing something to mark <reg orig="per-|manently">permanently</reg> <lb/>
her feelings. In times of old,' she <reg orig="con-|sidered">considered</reg>, <lb/>
'a church or a monument would probably <lb/>
have been erected on the spot.' But her desire <lb/>
was to do something which might benefit her <reg orig="fellow-|creatures">fellow-creatures</reg>.</p>
<p>The outgrowth of this true impulse of the Queen's <lb/>
was the establishment of the 'Victoria Stift' at <lb/>
Coburg, whereby sums of money are applied in <lb/>
apprenticing or in purchasing tools for worthy <lb/>
young men, or in giving dowries to deserving young <lb/>
women, or otherwise settling them in life.</p>
<p>In the Course of the same year the Queen's second <lb/>
daughter, Princess Alice, afterwards the friend and <lb/>
companion of her mother's first days of widowhood, <lb/>
was betrothed to Prince Louis of Hesse. In February <lb/>
1861, the Queen and the Prince Consort kept the <lb/>
twenty first anniversary of their wedding-day&mdash;'a <lb/>
day which has brought us,' says the Queen, 'and I <lb/>
may say, to the world at large, such incalculable <lb/>
blessings. Very few can say with me,' she adds, <lb/>
'that their husband at the end of twenty-one years <lb/>
is not only full of the friendship, kindness, and <reg orig="affec-|tion">affection</reg> <lb/>
which a truly happy marriage brings with it, <lb/>
but of the same tender love as in the very first days <lb/>
of our marriage.' The Prince Consort wrote to the <lb/>
aged Duchess of Kent, 'You have, I trust, found <lb/>
<pb n="28" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0041"/>
good and loving children in us, and we have <reg orig="experi-|enced">experienced</reg> <lb/>
nothing but love and kindness from you.'</p>
<p>Alas! it was the death of that beloved mother <lb/>
which was to cast the first of the many shadows <lb/>
which have since fallen upon the royal home. The <lb/>
duchess died, after a slight illness, rather suddenly <lb/>
at last, the Queen and the prince reaching her side <lb/>
too late for any recognition. It was a terrible blow <lb/>
to the Queen: she wrote to her uncle Leopold that <lb/>
she felt 'truly orphaned.' Her sister, the Princess <lb/>
Hohenlohe, daughter of the Duchess of Kent by her <lb/>
first marriage, could not come to England at the <lb/>
time, but wrote letters full of sympathy and <reg orig="inspira-|tion">inspiration</reg>, <lb/>
yet Her Majesty became very nervous, and <lb/>
was inclined to shrink into solitude, even from her <lb/>
children, and to find comfort nowhere but with the <lb/>
beloved consort who was himself so soon to be taken <lb/>
from her.</p>
<p>The great blow which made the royal lady a <lb/>
widow, and deprived the whole country of the <lb/>
throne's wisest and most disinterested counsellor, <lb/>
came on the 14th of December 1861. The Prince <lb/>
Consort's health had been somewhat failing for some <lb/>
time, and when, after a visit to Sandhurst, in <reg orig="fright-|ful">frightful</reg> <lb/>
weather, disease gradually declared itself, the <lb/>
Queen, in the deepest anxiety, fearing the worst, <lb/>
persistently hoped the best, and shrank from <reg orig="an-|nouncing">announcing</reg> <lb/>
to the country that there was any <reg orig="immi-|nent">imminent</reg> <lb/>
danger. During the early days of December <lb/>
1861, she lived 'in a dreadful dream.' She went to <lb/>
church, but 'she heard nothing.' It was not till the <lb/>
7th that the nation at large heard of the prince's <lb/>
illness. His wife and daughters read to him and <lb/>
<pb n="29" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0042"/>
nursed him, and he showed 'obvious reluctance to <lb/>
be left by Her Majesty even for the short intervals <lb/>
when her attendance was required elsewhere.' From <lb/>
the 12th to the 14th the dangerous symptoms <lb/>
increased. It is a touching scene to which we are <lb/>
admitted&mdash;the Queen bending over her dying, <reg orig="half-|unconscious">half-unconscious</reg> <lb/>
husband, and whispering: 'Tis your own <lb/>
little wife!' The end came on the night of Saturday, <lb/>
the 14th December, a date which has since become <lb/>
most singularly associated with the royal domestic <lb/>
history.</p>
<p>It has been well said by a distinguished writer <lb/>
that it was only 'since his death, and chiefly since <lb/>
the Queen's own generous and tender impulse <lb/>
prompted her to make the nation the confidant of <lb/>
her own great love and happiness, that the Prince <lb/>
Consort has had full justice.&hellip;Perhaps, if truth <lb/>
were told, he was too uniformly noble, too high <lb/>
above all soil and fault, to win the fickle popular <lb/>
admiration, which is more caught by picturesque <lb/>
irregularity than by the higher perfections of a <lb/>
wholly worthy life.'</p>
<p>Henceforth the great Queen was 'written widow,' <lb/>
and while striving nobly in her loneliness to fulfil <lb/>
those public functions, in which she had hitherto <lb/>
been so faithfully companioned, she has shrunk from <lb/>
courtly pageantry and from the gay whirl of London <lb/>
life, and lived chiefly in the quiet homes which she <lb/>
had always loved best, at Osborne and Balmoral. <lb/>
When she has come out among her people, it has <lb/>
chiefly been for the sake of some public benefit for <lb/>
the poor and the suffering. Even among the <reg orig="multi-|plied">multiplied</reg> <lb/>
pomps and ceremonies of her jubilee year she <lb/>
<pb n="30" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0043"/>
did not grudge to traverse the great east end of <lb/>
London, that perpetual and half-hopeless problem <lb/>
of philanthropists and social scientists, that she <lb/>
might grace with her presence the opening of 'the <lb/>
People's Palace.'</p>
<p>At times, there have been murmurs against the <lb/>
Queen, for failing in her widowhood to maintain the <lb/>
gaieties and extravagances of an open court in the <lb/>
capital of her dominions. It was said that 'trade <lb/>
was bad therefore,' and times of depression and want <lb/>
of employment were attributed to this cause. The <lb/>
nation is growing wiser. It is seen that true <reg orig="pros-|perity">prosperity</reg> <lb/>
does not consist merely in the quick circulation <lb/>
of money&mdash;above all, certainly not in the transference <lb/>
of wealth gained from the tillers of the soil to the <lb/>
classes which minister solely to vanity and luxury.</p>
<p>A few months after her father's demise, the <lb/>
Princess Alice married her betrothed, Prince Louis, <lb/>
and since her own death &lpar;on the same date as the <lb/>
Prince Consort's&rpar;, in the year 1878, we have had an <lb/>
opportunity of looking into the royal household <lb/>
from the point of view of a daughter and a sister. <lb/>
The Prince Consort's deathbed made a very close tie <lb/>
between the Queen and the Princess Alice, who <lb/>
herself had a full share of womanly sorrow in her <lb/>
comparatively short life, and the tone of perfect <reg orig="self-|abnegation">selfabnegation</reg> <lb/>
which pervades her letters is very <reg orig="touch-|ing">touching</reg>. <lb/>
Her last inquiries were about poor and sick <lb/>
people in her little capital. And the day before she <lb/>
died, she expressed to Sir William Jenner her regret <lb/>
that she should cause her mother so much anxiety.</p>
<p>In 1863, on the 10th of March, the Prince of <lb/>
Wales married the Princess Alexandra of Denmark, <lb/>
<pb n="31" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0044"/>
and in 1871, when the fatal date, the 14th of <reg orig="Decem-|ber">December</reg> <lb/>
came round, he lay at the point of death, <reg orig="suffer-|ing">suffering</reg> <lb/>
precisely as his father had done. But his life <lb/>
was spared, and in the following spring, accompanied <lb/>
by the Queen and by his young wife, and in the <lb/>
presence of all the power, the genius, and the rank of <lb/>
the realm, he made solemn thanksgiving in St Paul's <lb/>
Cathedral.</p>
<p>All the Queen's other children are married. The <lb/>
Princess Helena has become Princess Christian of <lb/>
Schleswig-Holstein. The Princess Louise has gone <lb/>
somewhat out of the line of princesses and has <lb/>
married the Marquis of Lorne, heir to the Duke of <lb/>
Argyll. The Princess Beatrice, of whom we all <lb/>
think as the daughter who stayed at home with <lb/>
her mother, has now become the wife of Prince <lb/>
Henry of Battenberg, without altogether <reg orig="surrender-|ing">surrendering</reg> <lb/>
her filial position and duties. Alfred, Duke of <lb/>
Edinburgh, married the favourite child and only <lb/>
daughter of the late Emperor of Russia, and sister <lb/>
of the present Czar. Prince Arthur, Duke of <lb/>
Connaught, wedded the daughter of Prince Charles, <lb/>
'the Red Prince,' of Prussia. And Leopold, Duke <lb/>
of Albany, took for his wife, Princess Helena of <lb/>
Waldeck. Prince Leopold had had a somewhat <lb/>
suffering life from his childhood, and he died <lb/>
suddenly while abroad, on March 28, 1884, leaving <lb/>
behind his young wife and two little children, one <lb/>
of whom was born after his death.</p>
<p>We have not attempted to touch upon the political <lb/>
history of Queen Victoria's times, nor has it been <lb/>
possible to follow her in her visits to different parts <lb/>
of her dominions, where she has been always received <lb/>
<pb n="32" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0045"/>
with enthusiastic loyalty, possessing, it is said, that <lb/>
royal art of acknowledging compliments from a crowd <lb/>
of people, which consists in making every person <lb/>
present believe that he or she is favoured with <lb/>
peculiar and marked notice.</p>
<p>We have only tried to draw within a small canvas, <lb/>
a portrait of her as 'mother, wife, and queen.' She <lb/>
has herself told the story of her happy days in her <lb/>
Highland home, nor has she shrunk from letting her <lb/>
people see her when she went there after all was <lb/>
changed, when 'the view was so fine, the day so <lb/>
bright&mdash;and the heather so beautifully pink&mdash;but no <lb/>
pleasure, no joy! all dead!' But she found help and <lb/>
sympathy among her beloved Scottish peasantry, <lb/>
with whom she could form human friendships, <reg orig="un-|chilled">unchilled</reg> <lb/>
by politics and unchecked by court jealousies. <lb/>
They could win her into the sunshine even on the <lb/>
sacred anniversaries. One of them said to her, 'I <lb/>
thought you would like to be here &lpar;a bright and <lb/>
favoured spot&rpar;, on his birthday.' The good Christian <lb/>
man 'being of opinion,' writes the Queen, 'that this <lb/>
beloved day, and even the 14th of December, must <lb/>
not be looked upon as a day of mourning.' 'That's <lb/>
not the light to look at it,' said he. The Queen <lb/>
found 'true and strong faith in these good simple <lb/>
people.' It is pleasant to note that by-and-by she <lb/>
kept the Prince's birthday by giving souvenirs to her <lb/>
children, servants, and friends.</p>
<p>In the north country, too, she met with little <lb/>
adventures, which doubtless helped to rally her <lb/>
courage and spirits&mdash;a carriage accident, when there <lb/>
was 'a moment during which I had time to reflect <lb/>
whether I should be killed or not, and <hi rend="italic">to think there</hi> <lb/>
<pb n="33" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0046"/>
<hi rend="italic">were</hi> still things I had not settled and wanted to do;' <lb/>
subsequently sitting in the cold on the road-side, <lb/>
recalling 'what my beloved one had always said to <lb/>
me, namely, to make the best of what could not be <lb/>
altered.' What a thoroughly loving, clinging woman's <lb/>
heart the 'Queen-Empress' shows when 'she feels <lb/>
tired, sad, and bewildered' because 'for the first time <lb/>
in her life she was alone in a strange house, without <lb/>
either mother or husband.'</p>
<p>She, who years before, during a short separation <lb/>
from her dear husband, had written, 'All the numerous <lb/>
children are as nothing to me when he is away&mdash;it <lb/>
seems as if the whole life of the house and home <lb/>
were gone,' could enter into the spirit of Dr Norman <lb/>
Macleod's pathetic story of the old woman who, <lb/>
having lost husband and children, was asked how <lb/>
she had been able to bear her sorrows, replied, 'Ah, <lb/>
when <hi rend="italic">he</hi> went awa', it made a great hole, and all the <lb/>
others went through it.'</p>
<p>The Queen has shown herself a model mistress. <lb/>
There is, too, a noble human grace about her acts <lb/>
of beneficence. For instance, in erecting an <reg orig="alms-|house">almshouse</reg> <lb/>
for poor old women in the Isle of Wight, <lb/>
she retained one tiny room, exactly like the rest, <lb/>
for her own use. Her diary is full of references to <lb/>
those who serve her, even in the humblest capacities. <lb/>
She abounds in practical sympathy with all their joys <lb/>
and sorrows. She has trained her children to live in <lb/>
the same spirit: nearly all of the Princess Alice's <lb/>
letters home contain references to domestic friends <lb/>
and messages to be conveyed to them. The Queen <lb/>
has found among her own household those of whom <lb/>
she could say that they 'deservedly possessed her <lb/>
<pb n="34" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0047"/>
entire confidence,' and whom she could best describe <lb/>
by the poet's lines: <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>A truer, nobler, trustier heart,</l>
<l>More loyal, and more loving, never beat</l>
<l>Within a human breast.</l>
</lg></q>
She has been always full of kindly consideration <lb/>
for others. Many stories are told of the gracious <lb/>
methods she has taken to efface the pain caused by <lb/>
blunders or awkwardnesses at review, levee, or <reg orig="draw-|ing-room">drawing-room</reg>.</p>
<p>Nor has the Queen lacked for friends upon another <lb/>
level. The old Duke of Wellington, the Iron Duke, <lb/>
the victor of Waterloo, is said to have loved her <lb/>
fondly. If any stranger had seen them together, 'he <lb/>
would have imagined he beheld a fond father and an <lb/>
affectionate daughter laughingly chatting.' She has <lb/>
herself recorded her great regard for Dr Norman <lb/>
Macleod, Lady Jane Churchill, and several others. <lb/>
But the devotion which she and the Prince Consort <lb/>
ever showed to the Baron Stockmar rises to the <lb/>
height of ideal friendship. Stockmar had been the <lb/>
private physician of King Leopold of the Belgians <lb/>
in his earlier days, and in the course of events <lb/>
became the trusted adviser of the young Prince <lb/>
Albert. To him the Queen and the prince wrote <lb/>
as only dutiful children might write to the most <lb/>
affectionate and wisest of parents. They sought his <lb/>
advice and followed it. They reared their children <lb/>
to do him honour. What this friend was, may be <lb/>
gathered from what shrewd people thought of him. <lb/>
Lord Palmerston, no partial critic, declared, 'I have <lb/>
come in my life across only one absolutely <reg orig="dis-|interested">disinterested</reg> <lb/>
man, and that is&mdash;Stockmar.' Subtle <lb/>

aphorisms on the conduct of life may be culled, <lb/>
almost at random, from his letters to the royal pair. <lb/>
We can take but one, which read in conjunction with <lb/>
the lives he influenced, is deeply significant:</p>
<p>'Were I now to be asked,' he wrote as he drew <lb/>
near his seventieth year, 'by any young man just <lb/>
entering into life, "What is the chief good for which <lb/>
it behoves a man to strive?" my only answer would <lb/>
be "Love and Friendship." Were he to ask me, <lb/>
"What is a man's most priceless possession?" I <lb/>
must answer, "The consciousness of having loved and <lb/>
sought the truth&mdash;of having yearned for the truth <lb/>
for its own sake! All else is either mere vanity <lb/>
or a sick man's dream." '</p>
<p>We have learned to know the Queen best by her <lb/>
words and actions towards those whom she has <lb/>
loved. The time has not yet come&mdash;and may it long <lb/>
be distant&mdash;when the world shall see fully how she <lb/>
has been loved in her turn. To her was not granted <lb/>
the bliss of a golden wedding, but to her has been <lb/>
given the glory of a golden reign, wherein the <lb/>
crown that she has worn in lonely splendour is <lb/>
radiated by the sweet lustre of tender womanly <lb/>
fidelity. It seems to us that the simple story of <lb/>
Victoria and Albert, finding an echo in all loving <lb/>
hearts everywhere, will live on till it becomes a <lb/>
legend&mdash;a sweet essence suffused through the moral <lb/>
atmosphere after the bitter things of political strife <lb/>
and courtly cabal are consumed away, and when <lb/>
even empires may have crumbled into dust. Let <lb/>
us close our little sketch with the words of one of <lb/>
Princess Alice's German attendants: 'God bless the <lb/>
Queen for her rare human love.'</p>

that fact lies the deepest significance and <lb/>

she will ever remain as the heroine of the <lb/>

<p>Florence Nightingale is the daughter of a country <lb/>
gentleman, William E. Nightingale of Lea Hurst, <lb/>
Derbyshire, and Embley Park, Hampshire. She was <lb/>
born in 1829, during her parents' visit to the Tuscan <lb/>
capital, from which beautiful city she received her <lb/>

her young life among the tors and valleys of her <lb/>
father's picturesque native county.</p>
<p>A very happy childhood it seems to have been. <lb/>
She grew up among sweet natural sights and sounds, <lb/>
surrounded by dear pets&mdash;ponies, dogs, and rabbits. <lb/>
It is said that when she was quite a little girl, her <lb/>
great pleasure was to accompany her father's old <lb/>
friend, the parish clergyman, when he went his <lb/>
rounds among his sick parishioners, and that her <lb/>
very first nursing effort was successfully bestowed <lb/>
<pb n="39" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0052"/>
upon the maimed dog of an aged shepherd. There <lb/>
is even a tradition that she used to bandage her <lb/>
dolls&mdash;and if this be so, it is a striking instance of <lb/>
the early impulse of an inborn faculty.</p>
<p>While her life's 'training' was thus unconsciously <lb/>
and happily commenced, her literary education was <lb/>
not neglected. Her father gave his little daughter a <lb/>
wider and higher education than was often bestowed <lb/>
on women even at that comparatively recent date. <lb/>
And while her head was stored with mathematics, <lb/>
classics, and modern languages, her hands were not <lb/>
left without skill. She became an excellent musician <lb/>
and an accomplished needlewoman.</p>
<p>As she grew older, she found energies within her <lb/>
which would not be quite satisfied even with the <lb/>
really useful life possible to a wealthy country <lb/>
gentlewoman. It has been well said that 'all work <lb/>
worth doing seems to leave us no choice &hellip; it is <lb/>
what we term expressively our <hi rend="italic">vocation,</hi> and in <lb/>
either case the harmony and happiness of life in man <lb/>
or woman consists in finding in our vocation the <lb/>
employment of our highest faculties, and of as many <lb/>
of them as can be brought into action.'</p>
<p>There is, of course, always the danger that what <lb/>
may seem to be the stirring of a vocation may prove <lb/>
but an ill-regulated distaste for the duties lying <lb/>
nearest&mdash;a restless craving for novelty and <reg orig="excite-|ment">excitement</reg>. <lb/>
The test which tries the reality of these <lb/>
youthful impulses is the readiness to submit to <lb/>
patient training and severe discipline in carrying <lb/>
them out.</p>
<p>Florence Nightingale stood this test. Feeling a <lb/>
strong attraction towards the art of nursing, she <lb/>
<pb n="40" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0053"/>
visited every hospital she came across, at home and <lb/>
abroad, and finally resolved to spend several months <lb/>
in the Pastor Fliedner Deaconesses' Institution, at <lb/>
Kaiserswerth, where the sternest and strictest views <lb/>
of practical duty are daily inculcated and practised. <lb/>
In a published letter she says: 'Being naturally a <lb/>
very shy person, most of my life has been distasteful <lb/>
to me.' In the same letter, the advice she gives to <lb/>
young women about their work is a revelation of <lb/>
her own character and methods: 'I would say also <lb/>
to all young ladies who are called to any particular <lb/>
vocation, qualify yourselves for it, as a man does for <lb/>
his work. Don't think you can undertake it <reg orig="other-|wise..&hellip;">otherwise..&hellip;</reg> <lb/>
If you are called to man's work, do not <lb/>
exact a woman's privileges&mdash;the privilege of <reg orig="inaccu-|racy">inaccuracy</reg>, <lb/>
of weakness, ye muddleheads. Submit <reg orig="your-|selves">yourselves</reg> <lb/>
to the rules of business, as men do, by which <lb/>
alone you can make God's business succeed; for He <lb/>
has never said that He will give his success and his <lb/>
blessing to sketchy and unfinished work.' She has <lb/>
further given us her own views on this subject of <lb/>
'training:' 'Three-fourths of the whole mischief in <lb/>
women's lives arises from their excepting themselves <lb/>
from the rules of training considered needful for <lb/>
men.'</p>
<p>After she left Kaiserswerth, she worked awhile <lb/>
with the Sisters of St Vincent de Paul in Paris. <lb/>
Then she returned to England, and for two or three <lb/>
years devoted herself to nursing aged invalid ladies <lb/>
in a small sanatorium allotted to their service. <lb/>
She was resting awhile from her labours in this <lb/>
quarter, when the great Crimean war broke out. By <lb/>
the autumn of 1854, many bloody battles had been <lb/>
<pb n="41" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0054"/>
fought, and owing to the deplorable breakdown of <lb/>
the sanitary administration, the mortality and <reg orig="suffer-|ing">suffering</reg> <lb/>
of our troops, and those of our allies and our <lb/>
prisoners, were almost greater after the conflicts <lb/>
than in them. 'Horrible and heartrending' was the <lb/>
epithet applied by a cabinet minister to the <reg orig="revela-|tions">revelations</reg> <lb/>
of mismanagement and neglect which were <lb/>
brought to light. A clergyman of rank, the Hon. <lb/>
and Rev. Sydney Godolphin Osborne, who was on <lb/>
the spot &lpar;Scutari&rpar;, has told the world that he 'could <lb/>
enumerate through a very long list, article after <lb/>
article of absolute necessity as a part of hospital <lb/>
stores, which was either not in existence, or so stored <lb/>
as to defy access to it..&hellip; There was an utter <lb/>
absence of the commonest preparation to carry out <lb/>
the very first and simplest demands in a place set <lb/>
apart to receive the sick and wounded of a large <lb/>
army..&hellip; For some weeks more than a thousand <lb/>
patients had no bedsteads..&hellip; For many weeks <lb/>
laundry there was none..&hellip; The patients lay either <lb/>
on the floor or on the wooden divans which <reg orig="sur-|rounded">surrounded</reg> <lb/>
some of the wards. The boards under the <lb/>
thin chaff beds on which they lay were rotten, and <lb/>
I have seen them alive with vermin and saturated <lb/>
with everything offensive. I was informed by one <lb/>
of the chief authorities, that if these wards were <lb/>
washed, so rotten were the boards they never could <lb/>
be got dry.&hellip; The reader may conceive my <reg orig="aston-|ishment">astonishment</reg>, <lb/>
on going to see the cholera ward the day <lb/>
after it was cleared &lpar;of patients&rpar;, when I found some <lb/>
of the authorities had begun to use it <hi rend="italic">for a <reg orig="store-|room">storeroom</reg> <lb/>
for the new blankets and quilts just come from <lb/>
England</hi>..&hellip; The meat brought up for the men's <lb/>
<pb n="42" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0055"/>
dinners was not only served out in a way perfectly <lb/>
disgraceful, but at times I have seen it so raw they <lb/>
could not eat it..&hellip; There were many men lying in <lb/>
bed with dysentery or open sores, who had not had a <lb/>
change of linen for months.'</p>
<p>Reports of these horrors reached the mother' <lb/>
country, and every patriotic heart was aflame with <lb/>
the desire to help. The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> opened a fund to <lb/>
receive contributions to purchase necessaries and <lb/>
comforts for the wounded warriors. And on the 15th <lb/>
of October, Florence Nightingale wrote to Sidney <lb/>
Herbert, the minister of war, offering her services to <lb/>
the hospitals on the scene of action. Her letter <lb/>
crossed an epistle from him, in which he had <reg orig="re-|quested">requested</reg> <lb/>
her to accept the very post for which she <lb/>
had thus volunteered!</p>
<p>There was then in existence no body of trained <lb/>
nurses on whose co-operation she could rely. But by <lb/>
the evening of the 21st she had got together a band <lb/>
of thirty-four women, with whom, accompanied by <lb/>
her friends the Rev. Mr Bracebridge and his wife, <lb/>
she soon after sailed for the East. Fifty more nurses <lb/>
followed.</p>
<p>She had started on an herculean undertaking. <lb/>
She was surrounded by disorder, incapacity, and <lb/>
jealousy. But from that north-east tower of the <lb/>
Scutari Hospital in which she and her nurses were <lb/>
lodged, there presently flowed 'a well-directed stream <lb/>
of untiring benevolence and charitable exertion. An <lb/>
invalid kitchen was quickly established&mdash;a laundry <lb/>
was added. The nursing was organised as well as <lb/>
the overburdened state of the wards would permit. <lb/>
The writer whom we have quoted before, says, 'To <lb/>

attempt the narration of the business transacted in <lb/>
Miss Nightingale's room would be a task beyond my <lb/>
powers. It was of a nature comprehending <reg orig="some-|what">somewhat</reg> <lb/>
of the detail of every recognised department; <lb/>
it embraced the consideration of every failure of duty <lb/>
on the part of the authorities at home and on the <lb/>
spot; it aimed at the attainment of order and <lb/>
humanity by limited means, to be directed against <lb/>
the widest possible field of disorganisation.'</p>
<p>Mr Osborne goes on to describe Florence <reg orig="Night-|ingale">Nightingale</reg>, <lb/>
at that time, as being 'in appearance, just <lb/>
what you would expect in any other well-bred <lb/>
woman, who may have seen perhaps rather more <lb/>
than thirty years of life; her manner and <reg orig="counten-|ance">countenance</reg> <lb/>
are prepossessing, and this without the <reg orig="posses-|sion">possession</reg> <lb/>
of positive beauty; it is a face not easily <reg orig="for-|gotten">forgotten</reg>, <lb/>
pleasing in its smile, with an eye betokening <lb/>
great self-possession, and giving, when she wishes, a <lb/>
quiet look of firm determination to every feature. <lb/>
Her general demeanour is quiet and rather reserved; <lb/>
still I am much mistaken if she is not gifted with a <lb/>
very lively sense of the ridiculous..&hellip;She has <lb/>
evidently a mind disciplined to restrain, under the <lb/>
principles of the action of the moment, every feeling <lb/>
which would interfere with it. She has trained <lb/>
herself to command, and learned the value of <reg orig="con-|ciliation">conciliation</reg> <lb/>
towards others and constraint over herself. <lb/>
I can conceive her to be a strict disciplinarian. She <lb/>
throws herself into a work&mdash;as its head&mdash;as such she <lb/>
knows well how much success must depend upon <lb/>
literal obedience to her every order..&hellip; Her nerve <lb/>
is wonderful..&hellip; She has an utter disregard of <lb/>
contagion.'</p>
<pb n="46" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0059"/>
<p>The same eye-witness tells us with indignation, <lb/>
that there were those who ventured to doubt the <lb/>
soundness of her religious views, and would fain <lb/>
have scrutinised her words and acts to discover to <lb/>
which of the many bodies of true Christians she <lb/>
belonged. Mr Osborne says, wisely, 'Her work <lb/>
ought to answer for her faith..&hellip;That she has <lb/>
been equally kind and attentive to men of every <lb/>
creed: that she would smooth the pillow and give <lb/>
water to a dying fellow-creature who might own no <lb/>
creed, I have no doubt..&hellip;If there is any blame <lb/>
in looking for a Roman Catholic priest to attend a <lb/>
dying Romanist, let me share it with her.'</p>
<p>The war came to an end at last. The nation <lb/>
would fain have given Florence Nightingale a public <lb/>
reception, yet she managed to pass through London <lb/>
unrecognised, and retired to her country home. But <lb/>
the Queen presented her with a magnificent <reg orig="decora-|tion">decoration</reg>, <lb/>
a cross set with diamonds, and sent her an <lb/>
autograph letter of thanks, and she was invited to <lb/>
stay as a guest at Balmoral, when the Prince Consort <lb/>
wrote to a friend, 'We are much pleased with her. <lb/>
She is extremely modest.' The Sultan of Turkey <lb/>
gave her a bracelet set with brilliants as a mark <lb/>
of his estimation of her devotion. Mr Sidney <lb/>
Herbert, speaking of her from his place in <reg orig="parlia-|ment">parliament</reg>, <lb/>
declared: 'I have received not only from <lb/>
medical men, but from many others who have <lb/>
had an opportunity of making observations, letters <lb/>
couched in the highest possible terms of praise. I <lb/>
will not repeat the words,' said he, 'but no higher <lb/>
words of praise could be applied to woman, for <lb/>
the wonderful energy, the wonderful tact, the <lb/>
<pb n="47" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0060"/>
wonderful tenderness, combined with the <reg orig="extra-|ordinary">extraordinary</reg> <lb/>
self-devotion, which have been displayed <lb/>
by Miss Nightingale.'</p>
<p>The accusers and opponents of the ministry made <lb/>
one especial exception in the list of their misdeeds. <lb/>
One of the most vehement of them 'congratulated <lb/>
the secretary of war on the sending out of the <lb/>
female nurses last autumn. Success more complete <lb/>
had never attended human efforts, than that which <lb/>
had resulted from this excellent measures..&hellip;It <lb/>
was impossible to do justice, not only to the <reg orig="kind-|ness">kindness</reg> <lb/>
of heart, but to the clever judgment, ready <lb/>
intelligence, and experience displayed by the <reg orig="dis-|tinguished">distinguished</reg> <lb/>
lady to whom this difficult mission had <lb/>
been intrusted.' See Kinglake's <hi rend="italic">Invasion of the <lb/>
Crimea.</hi></p>
<p>But, in fact, the most important result of Florence <lb/>
Nightingale's work was yet to come. This seems to <lb/>
have been foreseen, with rare wisdom, by Mr Sidney <lb/>
Herbert, when he first invited her to take charge <lb/>
of Scutari. For, while not disguising from her the <lb/>
magnitude and difficulty of the undertaking&mdash;he <lb/>
went on to say, 'If this succeed&hellip;a prejudice <lb/>
will be broken through, and a precedent established <lb/>
which will multiply the good to all time.'</p>
<p>At that date &lpar;1855&rpar; there were no facilities in <lb/>
England by which a lady could gain instruction and <lb/>
experience as a nurse. We know how different it is <lb/>
to-day. And the change came about in this wise. <lb/>
The nation, in its enthusiasm for Florence <reg orig="Night-|ingale">Nightingale</reg>, <lb/>
readily responded to the invitation of two or <lb/>
three ladies &lpar;prominent among whom was Mrs S. C. <lb/>
Hall, the late warm-hearted and distinguished Irish <lb/>
<pb n="48" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0061"/>
authoress, with whom, indeed, the idea originated&rpar;, <lb/>
to raise a fund in honour of its heroine, to be <lb/>
devoted to any purpose she might indicate. The <lb/>
result was the foundation of the Nightingale Home, <lb/>
for the training of nurses, connected with St <lb/>
Thomas's Hospital, London. This has proved the <lb/>
mother-house of many kindred institutions and <lb/>
organisations. Miss Nightingale, whose health was <lb/>
utterly broken down by her supreme exertions <lb/>
in the Crimea, and who has ever since remained a <lb/>
complete invalid, in the strictest confinement, has <lb/>
nevertheless been able to take a sustained and <lb/>
minute interest in the development of this work. <lb/>
Among some of its results, we may mention its share <lb/>
in the training of Miss Agnes Jones, the pioneer of <lb/>
reform in workhouse management and nursing, and <lb/>
of Florence S. Lees, known for her share in the <lb/>
nursing during the Franco-German War, and for <lb/>
her interest in the promotion of district-nursing <lb/>
among the poor in our large towns. She has also <lb/>
given her support to a movement for the erection of <lb/>
a central building which should combine a labour <lb/>
registry office, a woman's friendly society, a large <lb/>
room for meetings, and good cheap lodgings for single <lb/>
working-women. While on a visit in the autumn of <lb/>
1887 to her eldest sister, Lady Verney &lpar;who has <lb/>
some literary reputation&rpar;, at Claydon House, <reg orig="Buck-|inghamshire">Buckinghamshire</reg>, <lb/>
she was presented with a painting of <lb/>
her former home at Lea Hurst, by a deputation from <lb/>
the working men's club of Whatstandwell, <reg orig="Derby-|shire">Derbyshire</reg>. <lb/>
This picture came as a token of the interest <lb/>
she had taken in this institution.</p>
<p>In all her suffering and seclusion, Florence Night <lb/>
<pb n="49" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0062"/>
ingale has certainly not been idle. Apart from her <lb/>
interest in the labours of others, she has maintained <lb/>
an active share in the progress of nursing, by issuing <lb/>
her famous <hi rend="italic">Notes on Nursing,</hi> which going into <lb/>
thousands of hands, have communicated the results <lb/>
of her wisdom and experience to many who have no <lb/>
aptitude for work in a hospital ward, but who are <lb/>
almost sure to be called, at some time or other, to <lb/>
minister at some bed of suffering. Her ideas have <lb/>
already so commended themselves to all, in theory at <lb/>
least, that we are apt to forget how diverse they were <lb/>
from the notions formerly prevalent. Let anybody <lb/>
carefully observe, and he must soon verify such <lb/>
a 'note' as the following:</p>
<p>'The symptoms of the sufferings generally <reg orig="con-|sidered">considered</reg> <lb/>
to be inevitable and incident to the disease, <lb/>
are very often not symptoms of the disease at all, <lb/>
but of something quite different&mdash;of the want of <lb/>
fresh air, or of light, or of warmth, or of quiet, <lb/>
or of cleanliness, or of punctuality and care in the <lb/>
administration of diet, of each or of all of these.'</p>
<p>Or again: 'People who are in charge often seem <lb/>
to have a pride in feeling that they will be 'missed,' <lb/>
that no one can understand or carry on their <reg orig="arrange-|ments">arrangements</reg>, <lb/>
their system, books, accounts, &amp;c., but <reg orig="them-|selves">themselves</reg>. <lb/>
It seems to me that the pride is rather in <lb/>
carrying on a system, in keeping stores, closets, <lb/>
books, accounts, &amp;c., so that anybody can understand <lb/>
and carry them on&mdash;so that, in case of absence or <lb/>
illness, one can deliver everything up to others and <lb/>
know that all will go on as usual, and that one shall <lb/>
never be missed.'</p>
<p>And then: 'Wonderful is the face with which <lb/>
<pb n="50" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0063"/>
friends, lay and medical, will come in and worry the <lb/>
patient with recommendations to do something or <lb/>
other, having just as little knowledge as to its being <lb/>
feasible, or even safe for him, as if they were to <lb/>
recommend a man to take exercise, not knowing he <lb/>
had broken his leg..&hellip; Arguments are set forth, <lb/>
without any inquiry whatever, into the patient's <lb/>
real condition. "But it would be impertinent or <lb/>
indecent in me to make such an inquiry," says the <lb/>
adviser. True, and how much more impertinent is <lb/>
it to give your advice when you can know nothing <lb/>
about the truth, and admit you could not inquire <lb/>
into it..&hellip; There is nothing so absurd, nothing <lb/>
so misleading as the verdict one so often hears: "<reg orig="So-|and-so">Soand-so</reg> <lb/>
has no organic disease&mdash;there is no reason <lb/>
why he should not live to extreme old age;" <reg orig="some-|times">sometimes</reg> <lb/>
this clause is added, sometimes not: "Provided <lb/>
he has quiet, good food, good air, &amp;c." The verdict <lb/>
is repeated by ignorant people without the latter <lb/>
clause, or there is no possibility of the conditions of <lb/>
the latter clause being obtained; and this, the <hi rend="italic">only</hi> <lb/>
essential part of the whole, is made of no effect.'</p>
<p>In her <hi rend="italic">Notes,</hi> amidst the wisest counsels about <lb/>
diet, household sanitation, &amp;c., Miss Nightingale does <lb/>
not neglect what some people would foolishly call <lb/>
'trifles.' For instance: 'The effect in sickness of <lb/>
beautiful objects, of variety of objects, and especially <lb/>
of brilliancy of colour, is hardly at all <reg orig="appreci-|ated..&hellip;">appreciated..&hellip;</reg> <lb/>
I shall never forget the rapture of fever <lb/>
patients over a bunch of bright-coloured flowers. <lb/>
I remember &lpar;in my own case&rpar; a nosegay of <reg orig="wild-|flowers">wildflowers</reg> <lb/>
being sent me, and from that moment, <reg orig="recov-|ery">recovery</reg> <lb/>
becoming more rapid..&hellip; A small pet animal <lb/>
<pb n="51" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0064"/>
is often an excellent companion for the sick, for long <lb/>
chronic cases especially. A pet bird in a cage is <lb/>
sometimes the only pleasure of an invalid confined <lb/>
for years to the same room. If he can feed and <lb/>
clean the animal himself, he ought always to be <lb/>
encouraged to do so.'</p>
<p>Miss Nightingale has also written on <hi rend="italic">How to live <lb/>
and not die in India,</hi> also <hi rend="italic">Notes on Hospitals,</hi> and <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Suggestions for the arrangement and management <lb/>
of Children's Hospitals.</hi> In <hi rend="italic">Good Words</hi> &lpar;1868&rpar;, <lb/>
there appeared from her pen a warm eulogium on the <lb/>
beautiful character and life of Miss Agnes Jones, <lb/>
then lately departed, in which, while inviting other <lb/>
Englishwomen to follow her example, she explained <lb/>
to them most practically how, step by step, they <lb/>
might be enabled to do so.</p>
<p>But none of Miss Nightingale's literary <reg orig="produc-|tions">productions</reg> <lb/>
are more interesting than some fragments <lb/>
which appeared in <hi rend="italic">Fraser's Magazine</hi> &lpar;1873&rpar;. For <lb/>
these were not written on her special subject of <lb/>
nursing, but on the wide question, 'What will be our <lb/>
religion in 1999?' We instinctively turn to them <lb/>
for some revelation of that inner life, which in such <lb/>
a career as hers, remains 'the very pulse of the <lb/>
machine.' Nor are we disappointed. The literary <lb/>
'form' of these fragments is not good. The style <lb/>
is that of one who can scarcely think of manner, <lb/>
because overmastered by the thoughts burning <lb/>
within her. We recognise the intense practicality <lb/>
of her character, by her answer to the self-put <lb/>
question, 'What is it to be followers of Christ?'</p>
<p>Is it not to see God in everything, to find Him <lb/>
out in everything, in the order or laws as of his <lb/>
<pb n="52" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0065"/>
moral or spiritual, so of his political or social, and <lb/>
so of his physical worlds?'</p>
<p>One can hear the cry of her own womanly nature <lb/>
under the fogs of prejudice and the blasts of <reg orig="criti-|cism">criticism</reg> <lb/>
through which she has had to pass, when she <lb/>
says: 'Sympathy in good work is an essential of <lb/>
well-being..&hellip; It is sometimes for right and <lb/>
duty's sake that we leave the easy path where we <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">need</hi> not think of ourselves; where we are easily <lb/>
enjoying &lpar;I will not call it happiness&rpar;, perhaps <lb/>
praised and flattered with the "world's approbation," <lb/>
and go into a path for us so difficult as to involve <lb/>
continual doubt, care, reflection, even if not <reg orig="heart-|rending">heart-rending</reg> <lb/>
anxiety..&hellip; A conscientious person must <lb/>
often give up the self-complacency of conscience in <lb/>
the very path of conscience and of Christ, and must <lb/>
often think of the world's opinion in the very path <lb/>
of deserting the world's opinion..&hellip; Often in the <lb/>
path of right and duty, we must contend, not with <lb/>
anybody, but with everybody, and be contradicted <lb/>
by everybody..&hellip; There is a higher thing than to <lb/>
be grieved only at one's failure in God's work, and <lb/>
that is to strain every faculty not to make a failure <lb/>
&mdash;to give all one's powers to succeed in that work, <lb/>
as men do to succeed in making a fortune.&hellip;</p>
<p>'We are never lectured about the study of <reg orig="any-|thing">anything</reg> <lb/>
else in the wild, wishy-washy womanish terms <lb/>
that we are preached to about <hi rend="italic">life.</hi> And this is <lb/>
thought Christian: as if Christ had not been the <lb/>
boldest preacher that ever was about reforming life.' <lb/>
And she quotes sayings of His in support of her <lb/>
assertion.</p>
<p>We can understand how the scenes she had passed <lb/>
<pb n="53" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0066"/>
through had brought her to realise that 'there is <lb/>
no public opinion yet&mdash;it has to be created&mdash;as to <lb/>
not committing blunders for want of knowledge. <lb/>
Good intentions are supposed enough; yet blunders, <lb/>
organised blunders, do more mischief than crimes. <lb/>
Carelessness, indifference, want of thought, when it <lb/>
is organised indifference, as in a family, as in a <lb/>
college or university, as in an institution, as in a <lb/>
great government office, as in social or political <lb/>
life,&hellip;is more hurtful even than actual sin, as <lb/>
every day we may have cause to find out.&hellip; <lb/>
Never was anything less like remaining within <lb/>
"good intentions" than Christ's teaching &mdash; than <lb/>
Christ's example.'</p>
<p>Such a woman has the best right to say solemnly <lb/>
to us all: 'There must be an ideal in God's mind for <lb/>
each man, woman, and child, for the work he, she, <lb/>
or it is put here to do.' And as we think of the <lb/>
beautiful unity of Florence Nightingale's own life, <lb/>
from the tenderness and helpfulness of her <reg orig="child-|hood">childhood</reg> <lb/>
to the great services of her middle age, we <lb/>
recall Wordsworth's lines about <lb/>

<figure id="f10" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0069" rend="block"/>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Mary somerville</hi> was one of the most <lb/>
remarkable women of the present or past age <lb/>
&mdash;a lady not less noted for her profound <lb/>
learning, than for a noble simplicity of character <lb/>
combined with a desire to fulfil the domestic duties <lb/>
becoming to her sex and station. She was by birth <lb/>
a Scotchwoman, but a large portion of her long life <lb/>
was spent amidst the literary and scientific circles of <lb/>
England and the Continent. We should have known <lb/>
little regarding her history unless for her own <lb/>
diligence in from time to time writing down <reg orig="reminis-|cences">reminiscences</reg> <lb/>
of her early life and advanced age, which <lb/>
agreeable and instructive autobiography was edited, <lb/>
with additions, by her daughter Martha, and <reg orig="pub-|lished">published</reg> <lb/>
under the title of <hi rend="italic">Personal Recollections of <lb/>
Mrs Somerville</hi> &lpar;1873&rpar;.</p>
<p>Mary Fairfax, that being her maiden name, was <lb/>
a daughter of Captain &lpar;afterwards Admiral Sir <lb/>
William&rpar; Fairfax of the royal navy, a relation by <lb/>
descent of Lord Fairfax, commander of the <reg orig="Parlia-|mentary">Parliamentary</reg> <lb/>
forces in England. A sister of Captain <lb/>
Fairfax's wife was married to the Rev. Dr <reg orig="Somer-|ville">Somerville</reg> <lb/>
of Jedburgh, in whose manse Mary was born <lb/>
26th December 1780. It was a somewhat strange <lb/>
<pb n="57" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0070"/>
circumstance, for she afterwards was married to his <lb/>
son, her cousin. In the long absences of her husband <lb/>
on duty, Mrs Fairfax was constrained to live in a <lb/>
rigidly economical style, in a small house overlooking <lb/>
the sea at Burntisland, a town on the north shore of <lb/>
the Firth of Forth, opposite Edinburgh. Here Mary <lb/>
and her brothers Samuel and Henry were reared <lb/>
according to the plain and severe notions of the <lb/>
period. The solace of the little girl seems to have <lb/>
consisted in rambling along the seashore, picking up <lb/>
shells, or in strolls on the open grassy downs or links <lb/>
in quest of wild-flowers. Her education was of a <lb/>
rudimentary, though not at all unusual kind, for <lb/>
except reading and writing, and scarcely that, girls <lb/>
in most parts of Scotland went through a miserable <lb/>
course of school instruction, even as lately as the end <lb/>
of the eighteenth century.</p>
<p>'My mother,' says Mary, 'taught me to read the <lb/>
Bible, and to say my prayers morning and evening; <lb/>
otherwise, she allowed me to grow up a wild creature. <lb/>
When I was seven or eight years old, I began to be <lb/>
useful, for I pulled the fruit for preserving, shelled <lb/>
the peas and beans, fed the poultry, and looked after <lb/>
the dairy, for we kept a cow. I never cared for <lb/>
dolls, and had no one to play with me. I amused <lb/>
myself in the garden, which was much frequented <lb/>
by birds. My mother sent me in due time to learn <lb/>
the Catechism of the Kirk, and attend the public <lb/>
examinations. This was a severe trial for me; for, <lb/>
besides being timid and shy, I had a bad memory, <lb/>
and did not understand one word of the Catechism. <lb/>
When I was between eight and nine years old, my <lb/>
father came home from sea, and was shocked to find <lb/>
<pb n="58" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0071"/>
me a savage.' This dissatisfaction with the state of <lb/>
affairs led to Mary being sent to a boarding-school <lb/>
for young ladies at Musselburgh, where, though <lb/>
perfectly straight and well made, she was inclosed in <lb/>
stiff stays with a steel busk in front, while a band <lb/>
cruelly drew back her shoulder-blades. The only <lb/>
sort of instruction was learning to write in a rude <lb/>
way, and to acquire the rudiments of the English and <lb/>
French grammars. Many tears were shed in the <lb/>
dreary establishment, and Mary returned home little <lb/>
the better for her schooling. Again at Burntisland, <lb/>
she was solaced with her seaside rambles, and the <lb/>
study of natural objects&mdash;the shells on the shore, the <lb/>
flowers, the birds, the sky and its starry host <reg orig="afford-|ing">affording</reg> <lb/>
inexpressible delight.</p>
<p>'When the bad weather began,' she says, 'I did not <lb/>
know what to do with myself. Fortunately, we had <lb/>
a small collection of books, among which I found <lb/>
Shakespeare, and read it at every moment I could <lb/>
spare from my domestic duties. These occupied a <lb/>
great part of my time; besides, I had to <hi rend="italic">sheu</hi> &lpar;sew&rpar; <lb/>
my sampler, working the alphabet from A to Z, as <lb/>
well as the ten numbers, on canvas. My mother did <lb/>
not prevent me from reading, but my aunt Janet, <lb/>
who came to live in Burntisland after her father's <lb/>
death, greatly disapproved of my conduct. She was <lb/>
an old maid who could be very agreeable and witty, <lb/>
but she had all the prejudices of the time with regard <lb/>
to women's duties, and said to my mother: "I <lb/>
wonder you let Mary waste her time in reading; she <lb/>
never <hi rend="italic">sheus</hi> &lpar;sews&rpar; more than if she were a man." I <lb/>
was annoyed that my turn for reading was so much <lb/>
disapproved of, and thought it unjust that women <lb/>
<pb n="59" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0072"/>
should have been given a desire for knowledge if it <lb/>
were wrong to acquire it.'</p>
<p>Restrained in her desire for knowledge, there <lb/>
happened to be a pair of small globes in the house, <lb/>
of which her mother graciously allowed her to learn <lb/>
the use from the village schoolmaster. He also <lb/>
taught Latin and navigation to boys, but these were <lb/>
out of the question for girls, of whom very few were <lb/>
taught writing. Brother Sam was meanwhile getting <lb/>
his education in Edinburgh; and thither Mary, when <lb/>
thirteen years of age, proceeded with her mother for <lb/>
the winter&mdash;a great event, for it spoke of music <lb/>
lessons, and visits to places of interest in the old <lb/>
Scottish capital, the society in which was in a state <lb/>
of perturbation on account of the terrible convulsions <lb/>
in France. What was learned in Edinburgh bore <lb/>
good fruit. 'On returning to Burntisland,' says <lb/>
Mary Fairfax, 'I spent four or five hours daily at the <lb/>
piano; and for the sake of having something to do, <lb/>
I taught myself Latin enough, from such books as we <lb/>
had, to read C&aelig;sar's <hi rend="italic">Commentaries,'</hi> a work which <lb/>
few boys even at first-class schools can master under <lb/>
two or three years' training. Here we have the first <lb/>
glimpse of this extraordinary woman's aptitude for <lb/>
learning. She again went to Edinburgh to get <lb/>
lessons in dancing&mdash;the dances taught being reels <lb/>
and country-dances, with the <hi rend="italic">minuet de la cour,</hi> in <lb/>
which the great art consisted in learning how to <lb/>
courtesy and hold out the frock properly. At times <lb/>
about this period there were visits to uncles, and on <lb/>
one of these occasions she acquired a knowledge of <lb/>
arithmetic.</p>
<p>At Burntisland she saw a magazine in which there <lb/>
<pb n="60" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0073"/>
were some questions in algebra, a thing she had <lb/>
never heard of before, and she resolved, if possible, <lb/>
to learn what it was. The family library was <reg orig="ran-|sacked">ransacked</reg> <lb/>
for the purpose. 'In Robertson's <hi rend="italic">Navigation,'</hi> <lb/>
she tells us, 'I flattered myself that I had got what <lb/>
I wanted; but I soon found I was mistaken. I <reg orig="per-|ceived">perceived</reg>, <lb/>
however, that astronomy did not consist in <lb/>
star-gazing; and as I persevered in studying the <lb/>
book for a time, I certainly got a dim view of several <lb/>
subjects which were useful to me afterwards. <reg orig="Un-|fortunately">Unfortunately</reg>, <lb/>
not one of our acquaintances or relations <lb/>
knew anything of science or natural history; nor, <lb/>
had they done so, should I have had the courage to <lb/>
ask any of them a question; for I should have been <lb/>
laughed at. I was often very sad and forlorn, not a <lb/>
hand to help me.' What a revelation of a young <lb/>
mind groping about for knowledge, and denied all <lb/>
sympathy, even from the parents, who were <reg orig="un-|aware">unaware</reg> <lb/>
of the intellectual qualities of their gifted <lb/>
daughter!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, denied the means of learning algebra <lb/>
and mathematics, Mary Fairfax, still a girl of about <lb/>
fifteen, took to studying Greek, and without <reg orig="instruc-|tion">instruction</reg> <lb/>
learned enough to read Xenophon and part of <lb/>
Herodotus. Just think of that marvellous unassisted <lb/>
effort for a girl of fifteen! A fresh visit to <reg orig="Edin-|burgh">Edinburgh</reg> <lb/>
with her mother opened a pleasant vista of <lb/>
educational progress. She was allowed to attend an <lb/>
academy for drawing presided over by Nasmyth, the <lb/>
eminent landscape painter. Besides being a good <lb/>
artist, Nasmyth was a well-informed man, with <reg orig="supe-|rior">superior</reg> <lb/>
conversational powers. One day, in speaking <lb/>
about perspective, he told some of his lady pupils that <lb/>
<pb n="61" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0074"/>
they should 'study Euclid's <hi rend="italic">Elements of Geometry;</hi> <lb/>
the foundation not only of perspective, but of <reg orig="astro-|nomy">astronomy</reg> <lb/>
and all mechanical science.' Here, in an <reg orig="unex-|pected">unexpected</reg> <lb/>
manner, she got the information she wanted. <lb/>
Yet she durst not ask for the book. It was only on <lb/>
returning to Burntisland, that from the tutor of her <lb/>
youngest brother, Henry, she was able to procure <lb/>
Euclid and Bonnycastle's <hi rend="italic">Algebra,</hi> and she went with <lb/>
courage and assiduity into the study of these works. <lb/>
Do not, however, let it be supposed that in plunging <lb/>
into a course of mathematics she neglected ordinary <lb/>
duties. Her studies occupied only spare hours, such <lb/>
as are usually spent in idle vacuity. The <reg orig="informa-|tion">information</reg> <lb/>
given as to how she employed her time is worth <lb/>
quoting: 'I had to take part in the household affairs, <lb/>
and to make and mend my own clothes. I rose <lb/>
early, played on the piano, and painted during the <lb/>
time I could spare in the daylight hours; but I sat up <lb/>
very late reading Euclid. The servants, however, <lb/>
told my mother, "it was no wonder the stock of <lb/>
candles was soon exhausted, for Miss Mary sat up <lb/>
reading till a very late hour;" whereupon an order <lb/>
was issued' to stop this irregularity. Deprived of <lb/>
candles, she was thrown on her memory of Euclid, and <lb/>
lay in bed repeating his geometrical demonstrations. <lb/>
So things went on till another season was spent in <lb/>
Edinburgh, where, under the care of Lady Buchan, <lb/>
she made her first appearance at a ball, and had for <lb/>
partner Mr Gilbert Elliot, afterwards Earl of Minto. <lb/>
At this time, when budding into womanhood, Miss <lb/>
Fairfax had a graceful figure, below the middle size, <lb/>
a beautiful complexion, and bright intelligent eyes. <lb/>
Her ball dresses consisted simply of India muslin <lb/>
<pb n="62" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0075"/>
with a little Flanders lace. During each day she <lb/>
continued her painting studies, and practised not less <lb/>
than five hours at the piano.</p>
<p>Back again after these winter gaieties she returned <lb/>
as usual to Burntisland, studied, read romances, and <lb/>
revelled in Ossian; poetry being always her delight <lb/>
after any hard brain-work. Thus time sped away <lb/>
till 1804, when a revolution took place in her affairs. <lb/>
At the request of the Empress Catharine II., a British <lb/>
officer, Admiral Greig, had been sent to organise the <lb/>
Russian navy. His son, Mr Samuel Greig, came to <lb/>
the Firth of Forth on board a Russian ship, and was <lb/>
received by the Fairfaxes with more than ordinary <lb/>
hospitality, for he stood in the relation of cousin to <lb/>
Mary and her brothers. Greig had received the <lb/>
appointment of Russian consul for Britain, and was <lb/>
about to settle in England. What more natural than <lb/>
that he should fall in love with his pretty and <reg orig="accom-|plished">accomplished</reg> <lb/>
cousin, Miss Fairfax? He had alighted on <lb/>
his fate. He was wedded to Mary, who, with but a <lb/>
moderate trousseau, accompanied him to the scene of <lb/>
his official duties.</p>
<p>It has usually been stated that Mrs Somerville <lb/>
acquired her knowledge and taste for mathematics <lb/>
from her first husband, Mr Greig, which is obviously <lb/>
a mistake. She was an enthusiastic student of <lb/>
mathematics before she entered married life. Nor <lb/>
was her first husband long spared to her. After the <lb/>
brief space of three years, she returned to <reg orig="Burnt-|island">Burntisland</reg> <lb/>
a widow with two little boys. The younger <lb/>
of them died in childhood; the other, Woronzow <lb/>
Greig, barrister-at-law, survived till our own times. <lb/>
As a widow, with the care of her children, and in a <lb/>
<pb n="63" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0076"/>
sense independent of the narrow notions of her <lb/>
parents, Mrs Greig resolved to pursue a regular <lb/>
course of mathematics, even to the highest branches <lb/>
of the science. This course of study was steadily <lb/>
carried out under the counsels of Professor Wallace <lb/>
of the university of Edinburgh. She bought quite <lb/>
a library of English and French treatises, the very <lb/>
titles of some of which would almost frighten a <lb/>
modern fine lady: <hi rend="italic">Differential and Integral <reg orig="Cal-|culus">Calculus</reg>,</hi> <lb/>
Lagrange's <hi rend="italic">Theory of Analytical Functions,</hi> <lb/>
Callet's <hi rend="italic">Logarithms,</hi> La Place's <hi rend="italic">M&eacute;canique C&eacute;leste,</hi> <lb/>
and his <hi rend="italic">Analytical Theory of Probabilities.</hi> Pleasant <lb/>
studies these for a young and good-looking widow! <lb/>
Her friends, of course, thought her very foolish. <lb/>
They expected that with her independent means she <lb/>
would have entertained them with costly gaieties. <lb/>
She laughed at and cared nothing for their <reg orig="criti-|cism">criticism</reg>; <lb/>
continued to attend to her domestic duties, <lb/>
and recreated herself with the sublimities of La <lb/>
Place.</p>
<p>The widowhood was of no long duration. In <lb/>
1812, when she was thirty-two years of age, she <lb/>
again entered matrimony. Her second husband was <lb/>
her cousin, William Somerville, eldest son of Rev. <lb/>
Dr Somerville of Jedburgh, in whose house she had <lb/>
been born. Somerville had been much abroad as a <lb/>
surgeon in the army, and possessed that degree of <lb/>
general knowledge which enabled him to appreciate <lb/>
the amiability and intelligence of his wife. The two <lb/>
spent some time at Jedburgh and its neighbourhood, <lb/>
becoming acquainted with Sir Walter Scott and his <lb/>
friends. Being in 1816 appointed a member of the <lb/>
Army Medical Board, Dr Somerville removed to <lb/>
<pb n="64" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0077"/>
London, and there he and his wife took up their <lb/>
residence in Hanover Square. To Mrs Somerville <lb/>
the change was immense and gratifying. While <lb/>
never allowing herself to be withdrawn from what <lb/>
was due to her family and household, she enjoyed <lb/>
the acquaintance of noted men of science&mdash;the <lb/>
Herschels, Dr Wollaston, Dr Buckland, Mr Babbage, <lb/>
Sir Edward Parry, Captain Sabine, and so on; she <lb/>
also formed an intimacy with many literary, <lb/>
dramatic, and political celebrities. She took <lb/>
lessons in painting, and attended the chemical <lb/>
lectures of Sir Humphry Davy at the Royal <lb/>
Institution. Her society was courted, for already <lb/>
she had become known for her scientific papers. <lb/>
At no time, however, did she presume on the <lb/>
extent of her acquirements. Modest and retiring, <lb/>
she did not affect the part of a learned woman, <lb/>
neither did she offensively assume the masculine <lb/>
character, but, on the contrary, kept strictly <lb/>
within what is reckoned to be graceful in feminine <lb/>
manners.</p>
<p>She tells us that she frequently went to see <lb/>
Babbage, a man of transcendent intellect and a <lb/>
mathematician of the highest order. Looking at <lb/>
the machines which he had contrived to perform <lb/>
deep mathematical calculations, she breaks out in a <lb/>
pious fervour, that nothing had afforded her so <lb/>
profound an idea of the Deity, 'as these purely <lb/>
mental conceptions of numerical and mathematical <lb/>
science, which have been by slow degrees <reg orig="vouch-|safed">vouchsafed</reg> <lb/>
to man, and are still granted in these latter <lb/>
times by the differential calculus, now superseded <lb/>
by the higher algebra, all of which must have <lb/>
<pb n="65" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0078"/>
existed in that sublimely omniscient mind from <lb/>
eternity.' Without an adequate knowledge of the <lb/>
natural laws, and the grandly adjusted forces which <lb/>
preserve the balance of the universe, as represented <lb/>
by the higher mathematics, any conception of the <lb/>
divine power and intelligence will be necessarily <lb/>
imperfect.</p>
<p>The cheerful and happy life of the Somervilles <lb/>
in Hanover Square terminated sadly. They lost <lb/>
their eldest girl, and about the same time they lost <lb/>
their fortune, through the dishonesty of a person <lb/>
they had trusted. They now went to a house at <lb/>
Chelsea; Dr Somerville, while still retaining his <lb/>
place at the Army Medical Board, being appointed <lb/>
physician to the Chelsea Hospital. Here they <lb/>
resided for some years, Mrs Somerville keeping <lb/>
up her scientific and literary connection. Known <lb/>
for her marvellous mathematical knowledge, Lord <lb/>
Brougham, in 1827, asked her to write a summary <lb/>
of the <hi rend="italic">M&eacute;canique C&eacute;leste</hi> of La Place for the Society <lb/>
for Diffusing Useful Knowledge. Diffident as to <lb/>
her ability for the work, with her time much broken <lb/>
in upon by ladies calling 'to spend a few hours,' <lb/>
she reluctantly undertook the task, and it was a <lb/>
heavy one. However, by dint of immense study and <lb/>
perseverance, she got through it satisfactorily. The <lb/>
work exceeded its dimensions as at first <reg orig="comtem-|plated">comtemplated</reg>, <lb/>
and was published in an independent form <lb/>
in 1831, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Mechanism of the Heavens,</hi> <lb/>
with a dedication to Lord Brougham. This work at <lb/>
once achieved for its authoress a high place among <lb/>
the cultivators of physical science. The <hi rend="italic">Mechanism <lb/>
of the Heavens</hi> commanded the hearty and kindly <lb/>
<pb n="66" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0079"/>
expressed approbation of Sir John Herschel, and <lb/>
Professor Whewell wrote a sonnet in its praise. It <lb/>
became a class-book at Cambridge. That Mrs <lb/>
Somerville should have found time, in the midst <lb/>
of ordinary duties, to write a work requiring such <lb/>
depth of thought, is remarkable. One thing that <lb/>
helped her was a power of laying down and taking <lb/>
up a subject at pleasure; she was also indebted to <lb/>
a singular capacity for abstracting the mind from <lb/>
what was going on before her eyes. She could hear <lb/>
a great deal of silly talk, or some ridiculous harangue, <lb/>
and be thinking all the time about mathematical <lb/>
problems.</p>
<p>The success of the book brought honours on its <lb/>
authoress. She was elected an honorary member of <lb/>
the Royal Astronomical Society at the same time as <lb/>
Miss Caroline Herschel &lpar;another woman of <reg orig="extra-|ordinary">extraordinary</reg> <lb/>
genius&rpar;. Afterwards she was elected an <lb/>
honorary member of various learned societies at <lb/>
home and abroad. Her bust in marble by Chantrey <lb/>
was placed in the hall of the Royal Society. These <lb/>
honours caused a number of old friends to change <lb/>
their tune. Relations and others who had so <lb/>
severely criticised and ridiculed her, were now <lb/>
loud in her praise. The warmth with which Dr <lb/>
Somerville entered into her success deeply affected <lb/>
her.</p>
<p>Mrs Somerville had now won a European <reg orig="reputa-|tion">reputation</reg>. <lb/>
On visiting Paris for change of scene, she <lb/>
was waited on by Arago, Biot, Gay-Lussac, and <lb/>
other illustrious French savants. While in Paris, <lb/>
her mother died, aged ninety; her father having <lb/>
died previously. Notwithstanding a rather poor <lb/>
<pb n="67" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0080"/>
state of health, Mrs Somerville, when residing in <lb/>
Paris, wrote her celebrated work, <hi rend="italic">The Connection of <lb/>
the Physical Sciences,</hi> and saw it through the press, <lb/>
the proof-sheets being sent through the English <lb/>
embassy. We learn that much of this great work <lb/>
was written in bed. The book appeared in 1834. <lb/>
A highly flattering notice of it was given in the <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Quarterly Review,</hi> the writer comparing its authoress <lb/>
to Hypatia and Madame Agnesi. This, which is the <lb/>
best known work of Mrs Somerville, has passed <lb/>
through a number of editions.</p>
<p>We have not space to go into an account of her <lb/>
miscellaneous scientific explorations; and can only <lb/>
say that one of the more noted of these labours <lb/>
consisted in experiments on the magnetic influence <lb/>
of the violet rays of the solar spectrum. In 1835, <lb/>
during Sir Robert Peel's ministry, government <lb/>
granted her a pension of &pound;200 a year, to enable <lb/>
her to pursue her scientific labours with less anxiety. <lb/>
Her next work was a treatise on <hi rend="italic">Physical Geography,</hi> <lb/>
which was published in 1848. For this treatise Mrs <lb/>
Somerville was awarded the Victoria medal of the <lb/>
Royal Geographical Society, and two or three years <lb/>
before her death was elected an honorary associate <lb/>
of the Italian Geographical Society. Several editions <lb/>
of it have since appeared, besides an Italian <reg orig="transla-|tion">translation</reg>. <lb/>
When in Florence in 1860, Mrs Somerville <lb/>
lost her husband, and was a second time a widow. <lb/>
After this, she lived chiefly in Italy. Though now <lb/>
at a very advanced age, she retained her liveliness, <lb/>
took delight in reading and in keeping herself <lb/>
acquainted with public affairs, as well as with the <lb/>
progress of scientific discovery. In 1869 appeared <lb/>
<pb n="68" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0081"/>
her last production, a treatise <hi rend="italic">On Molecular and <lb/>
Microscopic Science.</hi></p>
<p>How she otherwise occupied herself in her old <lb/>
age is thus described: 'I have resumed my habit <lb/>
of working, and can count the threads of a fine <lb/>
canvas without spectacles. I receive every one who <lb/>
comes to see me, and often have the pleasure of <lb/>
old friends very unexpectedly. In the evening, I <lb/>
read a novel, but my tragic days are over; I prefer <lb/>
a cheerful conversational novel to the sentimental <lb/>
ones. I have recently been reading Walter Scott's <lb/>
novels again, and enjoyed the broad Scotch in them. <lb/>
I play a few games at <hi rend="italic">b&eacute;zique</hi> with one of my <lb/>
daughters, for honour and glory, and so our evenings <lb/>
pass pleasantly enough.'</p>
<p>Towards the close of her life the mind of Mrs <lb/>
Somerville was deeply occupied with thoughts of <lb/>
the future state and immortality. She says: 'To <lb/>
me, who am afraid to sleep alone of a stormy night, <lb/>
or even to sleep comfortably any night, unless some <lb/>
one is near, it is a fearful thought that my spirit <lb/>
must enter that new sphere of existence quite alone. <lb/>
We are told of the infinite glories of that state, and <lb/>
I believe in them, thought it is incomprehensible to <lb/>
us; but as I do comprehend, in some degree at least, <lb/>
the exquisite loveliness of the visible world, I confess <lb/>
I shall be sorry to leave it. I shall regret the sky <lb/>
and the sea, with all the changes of their beautiful <lb/>
colouring, and the earth with its verdure and <lb/>

<p>To the last, Mrs Somerville was fond of birds, and <lb/>
she and her daughters had several as pets. The <lb/>
villa they occupied was situated at a beautiful part <lb/>
<pb n="69" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0082"/>
on the Bay of Naples, within sight of Vesuvius. <lb/>
Here this admirable woman closed her earthly career. <lb/>
The following were her concluding memoranda: <lb/>
'The Blue-Peter has been long flying at my <reg orig="fore-|mast">foremast</reg>, <lb/>
and now that I am in my ninety-second year, <lb/>
I must soon expect the signal for sailing. It is a <lb/>
solemn voyage, but it does not disturb my <reg orig="tran-|quillity">tranquillity</reg>. <lb/>
Deeply sensible of my utter unworthiness, <lb/>
and profoundly grateful for innumerable blessings <lb/>
I have received, I trust in the infinite mercy of my <lb/>
Almighty Creator. I have every reason to be <lb/>
thankful that my intellect is still unimpaired; and <lb/>
although my strength is weakness, my daughters <lb/>
support my tottering steps, and by incessant care <lb/>
and help, make the infirmities of age so light to me <lb/>
that I am perfectly happy.'</p>
<p>Mrs Somerville, says her daughter Martha, 'passed <lb/>
away so gently, that those around her scarcely <reg orig="per-|ceived">perceived</reg> <lb/>
when she had left them. It was a beautiful <lb/>
and painless close of a noble and a happy life.' She <lb/>
passed away in sleep on the morning of the 29th <lb/>
November 1872, and was buried in the English <lb/>
Campo Santo of Naples. The Somerville Hall at <lb/>
Oxford, and the Mary Somerville scholarship in <lb/>
mathematics for women, were founded, shortly after <lb/>
her death, to perpetuate her memory.</p>
<p>The moral that may be drawn from the life of <lb/>
Mrs Somerville, of which we have offered but an <lb/>
imperfect sketch, is exceedingly obvious. <reg orig="Consider-|ing">Considering</reg> <lb/>
how meagre was her education, what chilling <lb/>
difficulties she had to encounter in her persevering <lb/>
efforts at self-culture while never neglecting ordinary <lb/>
duties, and looking to the literary and scientific <lb/>
<pb n="70" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0083"/>
eminence which she attained, we are entitled to <lb/>
point out to almost the humblest of her sex, that <lb/>
where there is a resolute determination to improve <lb/>
the intellectual and moral faculties, all obstacles <lb/>
have a fair chance of being successfully overcome. <lb/>
It is usually the <hi rend="italic">will,</hi> more than opportunity or <lb/>
natural capacity, that is deficient.</p>

<figure id="f13" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0086" rend="block"/>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> Burdetts are an old English family, <reg orig="trac-|ing">tracing</reg> <lb/>
their origin to one of the soldiers of <lb/>
William the Conqueror, who first settled and <lb/>
had lands in Warwickshire. Thomas Burdett, who <lb/>
was created a baronet in 1618, married the daughter <lb/>
and heiress of William Frauncys of Foremark, in the <lb/>
county of Derby, which has since been one of the <lb/>
residences of the family. Passing over several <lb/>
generations, we come to Sir Francis Burdett, the <lb/>
most popular English politician of his time, born in <lb/>
1770, and who succeeded to the baronetcy in 1797. <lb/>
Entering parliament, he made himself conspicuous <lb/>
by his opposition to government and the war, and <lb/>
his advocacy of parliamentary reform, Catholic <lb/>
emancipation, and other liberal measures. One of <lb/>
the most effective political speakers of the excited <lb/>
period at the beginning of the present century, <lb/>
he for many years was member of parliament for <lb/>
Westminster, and was the most popular man of his <lb/>
Day.</p>
<p>In 1793 Sir Francis married Sophia, youngest <lb/>
daughter of Thomas Coutts, the wealthy London <lb/>
banker; and besides his son and successor, had <lb/>
several daughters, the youngest of whom was Angela, <lb/>
<pb n="74" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0087"/>
to whom, and her maternal ancestors, we wish to <lb/>
draw special attention. As regards her father, Sir <lb/>
Francis, the eminent politician, he died in 1844.</p>
<p>The Coutts family are of Scottish origin. They <lb/>
spring from Coutts of Auchintoul, a sagacious <lb/>
northern laird, one of whose sons did not disdain to <lb/>
seek a livelihood by going into business in the small <lb/>
and prettily situated town of Montrose. There he <lb/>
in time became provost, an office of local <reg orig="distinc-|tion">distinction</reg> <lb/>
which was held also by his son and grandson <lb/>
in the seventeenth century. One of these provosts, <lb/>
Alexander Coutts, had a large family of sons and <lb/>
daughters. Our interest is centred in Patrick, his <lb/>
fourth son, who emulous of pushing out into the <lb/>
world, quitted Montrose, went to Edinburgh, and <lb/>
there occupied the position of a general merchant, <lb/>
importing and exporting goods, as early as 1696. <lb/>
Dying in 1704, he left the sum of &pound;2500 sterling&mdash;a <lb/>
great bequest in those days&mdash;to be divided among <lb/>
his children, two sons and a daughter, who were all <lb/>
young, and sent to Montrose to be reared by an <lb/>
uncle. The two boys, John and James, possessed <lb/>
the salient disposition of their father. While still <lb/>
young, they went off to seek their fortune in trade; <lb/>
John returning to Edinburgh and James proceeding <lb/>
to London. As James did not live to continue the <lb/>
family, we take up the history of John. Arriving <lb/>
in Edinburgh about 1718, when nineteen years of <lb/>
age, he served an apprenticeship in a mercantile <lb/>
concern, and lived with painstaking economy until <lb/>
he was able to go into business on his own account. <lb/>
Edinburgh was at that time a comparatively small <lb/>
place, and it had lately lost its political importance <lb/>
<pb n="75" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0088"/>
by the extinction of the Scottish parliament; but it <lb/>
was still a resort for persons of distinction, and there <lb/>
were in it men, the sons of landed gentry, who were <lb/>
laying the foundation of families of note by <reg orig="assidu-|ous">assiduous</reg> <lb/>
attention to trade. In his efforts at establishing <lb/>
himself, John Coutts showed as much eagerness as <lb/>
had been successfully demonstrated by the Hamiltons, <lb/>
the Hopes, the Trotters, the Ramsays, and other <lb/>
candidates for fortune. He began his mercantile <lb/>
undertakings in 1723, and from that year may be <lb/>
dated the effective rise and progress of the Coutts <lb/>
family.</p>
<p>The business initiated by John Coutts was a <reg orig="com-|bination">combination</reg> <lb/>
of general dealings and the negotiation of <lb/>
foreign bills of exchange. He imported and sold <lb/>
corn, either on his own account or as a <reg orig="commission-|agent">commissionagent</reg>. <lb/>
But, in proportion as he advanced in <reg orig="busi-|ness">business</reg> <lb/>
and acquired spare capital, as well as the <reg orig="con-|fidence">confidence</reg> <lb/>
of persons who deposited money at interest, <lb/>
he appears to have laid himself out chiefly as a <lb/>
negotiator of bills, a species of traffic which had not <lb/>
yet been appropriated by banks, and demanded much <lb/>
knowledge and shrewdness. Whether from family <lb/>
connections or otherwise, be became acquainted with <lb/>
people of good social standing, through whom he <lb/>
widened his base of operations.</p>
<p>Coutts's marriage with Miss Stuart of Allanbank <lb/>
was particularly fortunate; for, besides being an <lb/>
excellent housewife with lady-like manners, she <lb/>
proved a good mother. The pair had four sons&mdash; <lb/>
Patrick, John, James, and Thomas. Their dwelling, <lb/>
as was then the case universally, was a floor in a <lb/>
common-stair, on which &lpar;with two at each landing&rpar; <lb/>
<pb n="76" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0089"/>
there were not fewer than sixteen families&mdash;perhaps <lb/>
more; for the building was in the Parliament Close, <lb/>
in which were the tallest tenements in the city. <lb/>
The stair was specially known as 'the President's <lb/>
Stairs,' from having been honoured as a residence by <lb/>
the President of the Court of Session, besides whom <lb/>
here dwelt several persons of eminence, including <lb/>
the Earl of Wemyss. One now wonders how the <lb/>
families of such personages were accommodated; for <lb/>
each dwelling consisted of only four or five small <lb/>
low-roofed apartments, and the stowing away of <lb/>
children and servants must have been a matter of <lb/>
ingenious consideration.</p>
<p>Here, then, on the second floor of this august and <lb/>
populous tenement, dwelt John Coutts with his <lb/>
wife and four sons; and not only so, but here he <lb/>
carried on his banking business&mdash;of course, much in <lb/>
the cramped way that we still see banking concerns <lb/>
conducted at Frankfort-on-the-Maine, and other <lb/>
continental cities, where, in some by-street, you <lb/>
have to clamber up long stairs to cash your letters <lb/>
of credit. There is something to add to the <reg orig="accom-|modating">accommodating</reg> <lb/>
qualities of that second floor on the <lb/>
President's Stairs. In 1730 John Coutts entered the <lb/>
town-council of Edinburgh 'as first merchant <reg orig="coun-|cillor">councillor</reg>,' <lb/>
and being thus fairly in the way of attaining <lb/>
civic dignity, he rose to be Lord Provost in 1742. <lb/>
Shortly before this event, he had the good fortune <lb/>
to succeed to about twenty thousand pounds by the <lb/>
death of his brother James, who had been <reg orig="remark-|ably">remarkably</reg> <lb/>
successful as a merchant in London. It was a <lb/>
lucky windfall, for it enabled John, as Lord Provost, <lb/>
to show off in a style of hospitality to <reg orig="town-|councillors">towncouncillors</reg>, <lb/>
<pb n="77" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0090"/>
bailies, and great men generally, which <lb/>
had never before been exhibited.</p>
<p>Re-elected after being a year in office, John <lb/>
Coutts was Lord Provost from 1742 till 1744. On <lb/>
his retirement his health was considerably impaired, <lb/>
and he never got over the ill effects of his profuse <lb/>
entertainments. His health continuing to fail, he <lb/>
sought reinvigoration by a visit to Italy. The effort <lb/>
was unavailing. He died in the neighbourhood of <lb/>
Naples in 1750; leaving at his decease the <reg orig="reputa-|tion">reputation</reg> <lb/>
of an upright citizen and useful magistrate. <lb/>
Before setting out on his journey, he executed a <lb/>
new contract of copartnery, by which his eldest son, <lb/>
Patrick, was taken into the business under the firm <lb/>
of Coutts, Son, and Trotter. One learns with some <lb/>
surprise that the stock of the company amounted to <lb/>
no more than four thousand pounds&mdash;a small sum to <lb/>
be the basis of two extensive banking <reg orig="establish-|ments">establishments</reg>! <lb/>
John, the second son, who had been bred <lb/>
to mercantile pursuits in Holland, acted as assistant <lb/>
in the business, along with his two younger brothers; <lb/>
but none of them agreed with Mr Trotter, and that <lb/>
gentleman found reason to retire. His place as <lb/>
partner was taken by John Stephen, a Leith <lb/>
merchant, who had married Provost Coutts's sister, <lb/>
and had a son, Thomas, who was already making <lb/>
himself useful.</p>
<p>Now ensues a kind of revolution in that primitive <lb/>
banking concern. What with the four young <lb/>
Couttses and two Stephens, there were more hands <lb/>
than were at all needed; and it was judiciously <lb/>
resolved to make a division of forces by promoting <lb/>
an allied establishment in London. John and James <lb/>
<pb n="78" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0091"/>
remained with the elder Stephen in Edinburgh, <lb/>
under the firm of Coutts Brothers &amp; Co.; while <lb/>
Patrick and Thomas Coutts, along with their cousin, <lb/>
young Stephen, were detached to London. There <lb/>
they commenced business; the first place occupied <lb/>
by them being in Jeffrey Square, St Mary Axe. <lb/>
Leaving this branch concern for a moment, let us see <lb/>
what became of the old establishment in the <reg orig="Parlia-|ment">Parliament</reg> <lb/>
Close.</p>
<p>It is pretty obvious that success in any joint <lb/>
mercantile undertaking often depends on the clear <lb/>
and vigorous intellect and good business habits of <lb/>
one partner; the others interested being too <reg orig="fre-|quently">frequently</reg> <lb/>
little better than a sham or encumbrance. <lb/>
John Coutts appears to have been a partner of a <lb/>
choice description. Possessing agreeable manners, <lb/>
and with a knowledge of the world derived from <lb/>
his foreign training, he had that species of acute <lb/>
intelligence and tact which fitted him for his <reg orig="oner-|ous">onerous</reg> <lb/>
profession. By his good management the <reg orig="busi-|ness">business</reg> <lb/>
throve&mdash;taking rank as the foremost of the <lb/>
private banks in the city. In 1754, when just <lb/>
starting in its renovated form, it received as <reg orig="appren-|tice">apprentice</reg> <lb/>
a youth destined to make a figure in public <lb/>
affairs. This was Sir William Forbes, Bart., who, a <lb/>
year previously, had arrived in Edinburgh with his <lb/>
widowed mother, and now resided, as was befitting <lb/>
for a lady in reduced circumstances, in a small <lb/>
house, consisting of a single floor, in Forrester's <lb/>
Wynd.</p>
<p>A few months after Sir William Forbes had been <lb/>
installed as a partner, John Coutts was seized with a <lb/>
mortal disease, and being ordered by his physicians <lb/>
<pb n="79" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0092"/>
to drink the waters at Bath, he died there in 1761. <lb/>
We need not mention the changes that now ensued <lb/>
in the Edinburgh firm, further than that, in 1774, <lb/>
Mr James Hunter, the friend and fellow-apprentice <lb/>
of Sir William Forbes, was taken into partnership. <lb/>
By the successive deaths of four brothers of his <lb/>
wife, Mr Hunter succeeded to an estate in Galloway <lb/>
of considerable value, on which occasion he assumed <lb/>
the surname of Blair in addition to his own. In <lb/>
1781 he was elected member of parliament for the <lb/>
city; and a few years later, on account of his <lb/>
spirited exertions for the improvement of the city <lb/>
while Lord Provost, he was created a baronet. The <lb/>
firm of Sir William Forbes, Hunter-Blair, &amp; Co. <lb/>
lasted until our own times. At first, the <reg orig="com-|pany">company</reg> <lb/>
occupied the floor immediately below that <lb/>
which had been inhabited by Lord Provost Coutts. <lb/>
We regret to add that the tall tenement, which <lb/>
derived some interest from having been the cradle <lb/>
of the Coutts family, was unfortunately destroyed <lb/>
by fire during the disastrous conflagrations in <lb/>
November 1824. How the business was at length <lb/>
merged in the Union Bank of Scotland is well <lb/>
known.</p>
<p>A word now regarding the London branch of the <lb/>
bank. It did not long continue on its original <reg orig="foot-|ing">footing</reg>. <lb/>
Some changes took place. Mr Thomas Stephen <lb/>
died, and Patrick Coutts, who was a man of literary <lb/>
tastes, and fond of travelling, left the business to be <lb/>
conducted by his brother Thomas, a circumstance <lb/>
which led to a fresh change. At this time &lpar;middle <lb/>
of the eighteenth century&rpar; there were only two <lb/>
banking-houses on the west side of Temple Bar. <lb/>
<pb n="80" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0093"/>
One was the establishment of Mr Andrew Drummond, <lb/>
a son of Sir John Drummond of Machany, whose <lb/>
elder brother succeeded as fourth Viscount <reg orig="Strath-|allan">Strathallan</reg>, <lb/>
and was killed fighting in the cause of the <lb/>
Stuarts at Culloden. Drummond's Bank, as it was <lb/>
called, was patronised chiefly by the Tory families <lb/>
of the English aristocracy. The other bank was <lb/>
that of George Campbell, who had taken James <lb/>
Coutts as a partner, and was patronised by the <lb/>
Duke of Argyll and the Whig interest. Campbell <lb/>
&lpar;who had been originally a goldsmith&rpar; died in 1761, <lb/>
whereupon James Coutts assumed as partner his <lb/>
brother Thomas, who now withdrew from the two <lb/>
houses of Edinburgh and London. The new firm <lb/>
was James and Thomas Coutts. Such, with its <lb/>
extensive aristocratic connection, may be deemed <lb/>
the beginning of the great banking-house of Coutts <lb/>
&amp; Co. James Coutts died in 1778. Patrick, <lb/>
who had for years retired from active life, died <lb/>
within the present century. Thomas was the <lb/>
survivor of all the brothers, and under his auspices <lb/>
the house in the Strand rose to its present <reg orig="distinc-|tion">distinction</reg>. <lb/>
One of his early and active partners was a <lb/>
man of some note, Mr Robert Herries, eldest son <lb/>
of Herries of Halldykes, in Dumfriesshire, and who <lb/>
had been bred to business in Holland&mdash;then a <lb/>
common thing with young men&mdash;and was <reg orig="after-|wards">afterwards</reg> <lb/>
a merchant in Barcelona. Herries was a <lb/>
man of genius. He struck out the novel idea of <lb/>
issuing what are now called 'circular notes,' by which <lb/>
travellers, on depositing money with a banker, may <lb/>
procure orders to the amount, payable according to <lb/>
convenience, at a great number of banking <reg orig="establish-|ments">establishments</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="81" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0094"/>
abroad&mdash;each circular note being, in fact, a <lb/>
bill on London.</p>
<p>Outliving all his brothers, Thomas Coutts became <lb/>
the first banker in London&mdash;great from his wealth <lb/>
and munificence, mingling in the highest circles, and <lb/>
never forgetting Edinburgh, which he visited <reg orig="occa-|sionally">occasionally</reg>; <lb/>
notably on one occasion when, along with <lb/>
Sir Walter Scott, his friend &lpar;and kinsman, through <lb/>
the Allanbank family&rpar;, he was complimented with <lb/>
'the freedom of the city.' He died at a very <lb/>
advanced age in 1821, when by the male line the <lb/>
Couttses were extinct. He was twice married; by <lb/>
his second marriage he was united to Harriet Mellon, <lb/>
a well-known actress, who cared for him until his <lb/>
death. She was left with his whole fortune, but <lb/>
with a fine sense of honour, although married to the <lb/>
Duke of St Albans, at her death she left the whole <lb/>
property to Angela Burdett.</p>
<p>By his first marriage Thomas Coutts had three <lb/>
daughters&mdash;the 'Three Graces,' as they were called. <lb/>
Susan, the eldest, became Countess of Guildford; <lb/>
Frances, the second, became Marchioness of Bute; <lb/>
and Sophia, the youngest, as already said, was <lb/>
married to Sir Francis Burdett, Bart, the noted <lb/>
politician in the early years of the present century. <lb/>
Angela, the youngest daughter of Sir Francis, born <lb/>
April 21, 1814, having succeeded to the great <lb/>
property of her grandfather, Mr Coutts, under the <lb/>
will of that gentleman's widow, the Duchess of St <lb/>
Albans, assumed by sign-manual the additional <reg orig="sur-|name">surname</reg> <lb/>
of Coutts, and in 1871 was created Baroness <lb/>
Burdett-Coutts. The freedom of the cities of London <lb/>
and Edinburgh have been conferred upon her. When <lb/>
<pb n="82" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0095"/>
the freedom of the city of London was conferred upon <lb/>
her in July 1872, as a tribute for her many acts of <lb/>
beneficence, she received at the same time a <reg orig="compli-|mentary">complimentary</reg> <lb/>
address inclosed in a beautiful gold casket, <lb/>
with several compartments. One of these bore the <lb/>
arms of the baroness, while the other seven bore <lb/>
emblematic pictures of her own noble life, '<reg orig="Feed-|ing">Feeding</reg> <lb/>
the Hungry,' 'Giving Drink to the Thirsty.' <lb/>
'Clothing the Naked,' 'Visiting the Captive,' '<reg orig="Lodg-|ing">Lodging</reg> <lb/>
the Homeless,' 'Visiting the Sick,' and 'Burying <lb/>
the Dead.' Supporting the box at its four corners <lb/>
were the four cardinal virtues, Prudence, <reg orig="Temper-|ance">Temperance</reg>, <lb/>
Fortitude, and Justice. The lid was <reg orig="sur-|mounted">surmounted</reg> <lb/>
by the arms of London. The baroness <lb/>
made a suitable reply in her own person. Of this <lb/>
lady's public-spirited undertakings, extensive yet <lb/>
delicate acts of beneficence, and efforts at home <lb/>
and abroad to assuage the sufferings of animals, we <lb/>
can only give a brief outline. Latterly, she has <lb/>
been signalised by her munificent sympathy for the <lb/>
unhappy sufferers from the war in Turkey in 1877. <lb/>
She instituted the Turkish Compassionate Fund, by <lb/>
which means about &pound;30,000 were raised for the <lb/>
alleviation of the sufferings of the Turkish and <lb/>
Bulgarian peasantry. The Order of the Medjidie <lb/>
was conferred upon her by the sultan; this was <lb/>
the first time such a distinction was conferred upon <lb/>
a woman.</p>
<p>Amongst the beneficent acts of the Baroness <lb/>
Burdett-Coutts have been the building of churches <lb/>
at Carlisle and at Westminster, the latter with three <lb/>
schools and a parsonage, and an endowment of &pound;30,000. <lb/>
She has also given &pound;50,000 for the endowment of <lb/>
<pb n="83" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0096"/>
the three colonial bishoprics of Adelaide, Cape Town, <lb/>
and British Columbia. In 1859 she established a <reg orig="shoe-|black">shoeblack</reg> <lb/>
brigade for destitute boys. She has interested <lb/>
herself in the education of young girls in sewing and <lb/>
other household work, and has opened reformatory <lb/>
schools for girls. London has largely benefited by <lb/>
her generosity; one degraded portion called Nova <lb/>
Scotia Gardens has been transformed by building <lb/>
new houses and charging low weekly rentals. <reg orig="Col-|umbia">Columbia</reg> <lb/>
Market, close by, was built for the convenience <lb/>
of poor purchasers; and a museum and reading-room <lb/>
have been established. She has presented the city <lb/>
with three drinking fountains&mdash;one in Victoria Park, <lb/>
another at the entrance to the Zoological Gardens, <lb/>
Regent's Park, another near Columbia Market. At <lb/>
her instigation the churchyard of Old St Pancras, <lb/>
London, was transformed into a recreation ground in <lb/>
1877. William Howitt has said of her: 'I suppose <lb/>
no other woman under the rank of a queen ever did <lb/>
so much for the Established Church.&hellip;But perhaps <lb/>
the noblest and most enduring of her works is seen <lb/>
in the clean and smiling hearths of hitherto too much <lb/>
neglected and ill-housed poverty.'</p>
<p>The baroness has also helped people to help <reg orig="them-|selves">themselves</reg>. <lb/>
She furnished the weavers in the east end <lb/>
of London, when out of work, with funds to emigrate <lb/>
to Queensland, where they founded a prosperous and <lb/>
happy colony. Some families in Girvan, Scotland, <lb/>
when in distress, were helped to emigrate to America. <lb/>
She sent food, clothing, and fishing-tackle to the <lb/>
starving fishermen at Skibbereen, Ireland, and <reg orig="eatab-|lished">eatablished</reg> <lb/>
a technical school for giving instruction in <lb/>
fishing, sail, and net making, at Baltimore, in the <lb/>
<pb n="84" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0097"/>
neighbourhood. When Sir Henry James undertook <lb/>
a topographical survey of Jerusalem, in order to <lb/>
discover the remains of King Solomon's temple, she <lb/>
supplied the necessary funds. Many struggling <lb/>
artists have also benefited by her benefactions; and <lb/>
she has also provided a shelter and home for young <lb/>
women in London.</p>
<p>A young man named Mr William Lehmann <lb/>
Ashmead-Bartlett, about half her own age, had <lb/>
helped her with money affairs, and to dispense her <lb/>
great charities. He went to Turkey in 1877 to <lb/>
administer the funds collected in aid of the Turkish <lb/>
and Bulgarian peasantry. On February 12, 1881, the <lb/>
baroness was married to her assistant in Christ <lb/>
Church, Piccadilly. She had refused the hand of <lb/>
many, but she was now to be united to the man of <lb/>
her choice. She was married in a dress of <reg orig="ivory-|white">ivorywhite</reg> <lb/>
satin, a few chosen friends were present, with <lb/>
several children as bridesmaids. The wedding-<reg orig="break-|fast">breakfast</reg> <lb/>
was held at the house of her sister, when they <lb/>
left for Ingleden, Kent, on a visit to Admiral Gordon. <lb/>
By this marriage she forfeited a portion of her <lb/>
fortune, but there is no reason to doubt that it has <lb/>
been a happy one. Her husband is a member of <lb/>
parliament, and has legally added the name of his <lb/>
wife to his own, so that he is known as Mr <reg orig="Burdett-|Coutts">BurdettCoutts</reg> <lb/>
Bartlett.</p>
<p>The town mansion of the baroness is in Stratton <lb/>
Street, Piccadilly, with a spacious frontage <reg orig="overlook-|ing">overlooking</reg> <lb/>
the Green Park. Here Mrs Coutts, afterwards <lb/>
the Duchess of St Albans, gave her splendid <reg orig="enter-|tainments">entertainments</reg>. <lb/>
The house possesses some fine pictures; <lb/>
notably one of Sir Francis Burdett, a full length; <lb/>
<pb n="85" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0098"/>
one of John Coutts, by Allan Ramsay; and a <lb/>
very charming picture of the 'Three Graces,' one <lb/>
of whom was the mother of the Baroness <reg orig="Burdett-|Coutts">BurdettCoutts</reg>. <lb/>
Her country home is Holly Lodge, <reg orig="High-|gate">Highgate</reg>; <lb/>
every summer her grounds are thrown open <lb/>
to parties of school children. In July 1867, she <lb/>
entertained here two thousand Belgian volunteers on <lb/>
the occasion of the visit of the Prince and Princess <lb/>
of Wales, and about five hundred other royal and <lb/>
distinguished guests. It is scarcely possible to <reg orig="men-|tion">mention</reg> <lb/>
here all the channels in which her beneficence <lb/>
has flowed; she is a patron of the Society for the <lb/>
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and has lent her <lb/>
countenance and aid to all the best forms of the <lb/>
practical benevolence of the present day.</p>
<p>Lady Burdett-Coutts surpassed all other subjects <lb/>
in the decoration of her London house on the <reg orig="occa-|sion">occasion</reg> <lb/>
of the celebration of the Queen's Jubilee in 1887. <lb/>
There was nothing like her decorations for <reg orig="magnifi-|cence">magnificence</reg> <lb/>
or attraction; and her garden-parties at a later <lb/>
date were such as no other subject of the Queen <lb/>
could accomplish within the same distance of Charing <lb/>
Cross.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> modern soldier, whether in sickness or <lb/>
in health, is very differently cared for now <lb/>
from what he was formerly. Standing <lb/>
on the banks of Southampton Water, Netley <lb/>
Hospital is almost the first building on his native <lb/>
shore to greet the eyes of the returning invalid. <lb/>
The troop-ships coming into Southampton from <lb/>
India and elsewhere stop to land their sick at <lb/>
Netley; and on so vast a scale is the institution, <lb/>
that it is no uncommon thing for five or six hundred <lb/>
patients to be received into it on the same day <reg orig="with-|out">without</reg> <lb/>
occasioning any unusual commotion. Beautiful <lb/>
grounds sloping down to the very water's edge; long <lb/>
covered galleries for patients who are unable to go <lb/>
out of doors, to exercise in; spacious airy wards, and <lb/>
all the most recent improvements in hospital <reg orig="manage-|ment">management</reg>, <lb/>
the whole under control of an able and <reg orig="experi-|enced">experienced</reg> <lb/>
medical staff, here offer to the invalid soldier <lb/>
every chance which skill and care can give him, of <lb/>
recruiting the health which may have been <reg orig="under-|mined">undermined</reg> <lb/>
by service in unhealthy climates, or by other <lb/>
causes.</p>
<p>Happily, the proportion of invalid soldiers to those <lb/>
who are sound is but small, and the amusement and <lb/>
<pb n="87" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0100"/>
instruction of these latter have been consulted by the <lb/>
introduction of recreation rooms in every barrack, <lb/>
which are well supplied with books, papers, <reg orig="period-|icals">periodicals</reg>, <lb/>
&amp;c. This is a great advantage; but soldiers <lb/>
like sometimes to go out of barracks; they like to <lb/>
meet with other society than the men of their own <lb/>
regiments; above all, they like to escape sometimes <lb/>
from the eye of authority. Previously, the only <lb/>
resort for them in such cases had been the <reg orig="public-|houses">publichouses</reg>; <lb/>
and just as a man with every accommodation <lb/>
in his own house likes to go to his club sometimes, <lb/>
so it is only natural that a soldier should like to mix <lb/>
with his friends in places where he feels that he is <lb/>
free from the supervision of his officers. To provide <lb/>
such a resort for him, where he might find recreation <lb/>
and congenial society without the temptations of the <lb/>
public-house, has been the object of those who have <lb/>
tried the experiment of soldiers' institutes. The <lb/>
first of these was established at Aldershott, and has <lb/>
since been succeeded by others in the garrison towns <lb/>
of Great Britain.</p>
<p>The Portsmouth Soldiers' Institute owes its <reg orig="found-|ation">foundation</reg> <lb/>
to the energy and perseverance of a woman. <lb/>
When the social history of the present age is written, <lb/>
one of the most beautiful pages will be that on which <lb/>
are recorded the deeds of women-workers, and among <lb/>
this noble and devoted band the name of Sarah <lb/>
Robinson, the 'Soldier's Friend,' will deserve an <lb/>
honoured place. Born in 1834, from her earliest <lb/>
years Miss Robinson seems to have been inspired <lb/>
by a passion for soldiers and military exploits. <lb/>
Some mission work she had begun was interrupted <lb/>
by illness, and she had to go to London to be treated <lb/>
<pb n="88" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0101"/>
for spinal complaint. Although she returned with <lb/>
a knowledge that her trouble was incurable, and <lb/>
although she could only walk about with a steel <lb/>
apparatus, Miss Robinson made up her mind to be <lb/>
as useful as she could to her fellow-creatures. <lb/>
While residing at Guildford in 1862 her eyes were <lb/>
first opened to the dangers and temptations of a <lb/>
soldier's life. Her ambition was to be the means of <lb/>
doing some good, morally as well as materially, to <lb/>
the soldier; and to this work she has given all her <lb/>
time and influence, at the sacrifice of all a woman's <lb/>
prejudices.</p>
<p>Previous to 1880 she was able to travel about and <lb/>
collect funds for her benevolent work, but since that <lb/>
time, although confined to her invalid couch, she has <lb/>
managed to keep in motion the machinery of the <lb/>
Soldiers' Institute, Sailors' Welcome, Nobb's Lane <lb/>
Coffee Tavern, Camber Coffee Tavern, at Portsmouth, <lb/>
and the Institute at Alexandria, all of which owe <lb/>
their establishment to her benevolent spirit.</p>
<p>That there was a large field for such work in <lb/>
the army, and that it is especially and pre-eminently <lb/>
woman's work, has been repeatedly asserted by <lb/>
many of the ablest and most experienced of our <lb/>
military authorities. In spite of chaplains and <lb/>
lay helpers, in spite of a large number of <reg orig="earnest-|minded">earnestminded</reg> <lb/>
officers&mdash;the salt of the army&mdash;there is a <lb/>
want in the unmarried soldier's life, cut off from <lb/>
home and family ties, which can only be filled <lb/>
up by the influence of a woman. To this work <lb/>
Miss Robinson has devoted her whole time and <lb/>
means. She first began her good work in <reg orig="Alder-|shott">Aldershott</reg> <lb/>
in 1862, where she started a mission <lb/>
<pb n="89" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0102"/>
amongst the soldiers who were encamped there, <lb/>
but success did not attend her labours. Four <lb/>
years afterwards we hear of her labouring amongst <lb/>
the militia at Devizes, and visiting the different <lb/>
garrison towns in the south of England, in each of <lb/>
which she was the means of doing an incalculable <lb/>
amount of good, and where she earned the <reg orig="bless-|ings">blessings</reg> <lb/>
of those whom it is the object of her life to <lb/>
benefit.</p>
<p>In 1873, Miss Robinson, with the sanction of the <lb/>
War Office and the commander-in-chief, accompanied <lb/>
the army during the autumn man&oelig;uvres on <reg orig="Dart-|moor">Dartmoor</reg>, <lb/>
taking the management of a refreshment hut <lb/>
and a recreation tent, the one to supply the troops <lb/>
with coffee, tea, eatables; the other, with provision <lb/>
for letter-writing, newspapers, periodicals, books, and <lb/>
games. In order to superintend this undertaking, <lb/>
Miss Robinson was obliged to follow the troops in a <lb/>
van, in which she made her dwelling in gipsy fashion <lb/>
during the whole period of the man&oelig;uvres. The <lb/>
fatigue and anxiety attending the business were very <lb/>
great, but Miss Robinson had the satisfaction of <reg orig="find-|ing">finding</reg> <lb/>
that her experiment proved a complete success, <lb/>
and was the means of contributing immensely to the <lb/>
comfort and well-being of the troops. The entire <lb/>
drawings during the man&oelig;uvres, chiefly in <reg orig="penny-|worths">pennyworths</reg>, <lb/>
amounted to &pound;873,3s. 9d. It was stated, on <lb/>
the concurrent testimony of those who were qualified <lb/>
to form an opinion, that there never had been so <lb/>
little drunkenness and crime in the camp as in that <lb/>
year; and the generals in command, and the <reg orig="com-|manding-officers">commanding-officers</reg> <lb/>
of regiments, expressed their <reg orig="grati-|tude">gratitude</reg> <lb/>
to Miss Robinson. The men there as well <lb/>
<pb n="90" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0103"/>
as in other places, were devoted to her; and to <lb/>
show the genuine friendliness of feeling with which <lb/>
she inspired them, we may quote the words of one of <lb/>
themselves: 'We call Miss Robinson the Soldier's <lb/>
Friend because she isn't like some people who try <lb/>
to do us good. She doesn't sit at the top of the <lb/>
stairs and tell us what we ought to do; but she <lb/>
comes down, and takes us by the hand, and looks us <lb/>
in the face, and leads us in the right way.'</p>
<p>It was, we believe, the successful results of this <lb/>
campaign on Dartmoor which determined Miss <reg orig="Robin-|son">Robinson</reg> <lb/>
to start a Soldiers' Institute at Portsmouth. <lb/>
There could scarcely be more need for such an <lb/>
institution in any place than in Portsmouth; <lb/>
and in support of this assertion, we may remind <lb/>
our readers that Portsmouth is not only a great <lb/>
military garrison, but is also a large naval <lb/>
station. It is here that most of Her Majesty's ships <lb/>
are paid off before being again put in commission; <lb/>
and it is here that the troops returning to England <lb/>
from India and other foreign stations disembark, and <lb/>
are generally quartered for some months before being <lb/>
sent elsewhere. During their foreign service, many <lb/>
of the regiments have accumulated money in the <lb/>
regimental savings-bank, which amounts in the <reg orig="aggre-|gate">aggregate</reg> <lb/>
to a considerable sum on their arrival in <lb/>
England. The sailors and marines, too, on coming <lb/>
ashore after being paid off, are in possession of sums <lb/>
varying from ten to fifty pounds apiece, which, with <lb/>
characteristic recklessness, they are impatient to be <lb/>
rid of. This is well known to the land-sharks who <lb/>
are waiting for their prey. Even before they can <lb/>
land, the ships are boarded by agents from the low <lb/>
<pb n="91" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0104"/>
lodging-houses in the town, whose object is by one <lb/>
means and another to become possessed of the <reg orig="earn-|ings">earnings</reg> <lb/>
of the men.</p>
<p>In Portsmouth, with a population of something <lb/>
over one hundred and thirty thousand, there are <lb/>
upwards of one thousand public-houses, &amp;c., but <lb/>
&lpar;until the establishment of the Soldiers' Institute&rpar; <lb/>
not one single home, institute, or respectable resort <lb/>
for recreation or improvement. In such a state of <lb/>
things, the demoralisation of the soldiers quartered <lb/>
there follows almost as a matter of necessity. It is <lb/>
stated that a single regiment, on its return from <lb/>
India, squandered six thousand pounds from the <lb/>
savings-bank within two or three months, and lost <lb/>
five hundred good-conduct badges. It was the <reg orig="con-|sideration">consideration</reg> <lb/>
of this which induced Miss Robinson to <lb/>
direct her energies to the formation of the Soldiers' <lb/>
Institute at Portsmouth. The military authorities <lb/>
had been so favourably impressed by Miss Robinson's <lb/>
work during the autumn man&oelig;uvres, that upon <lb/>
application, the War Office promised a government <lb/>
grant of land for the erection of a suitable building. <lb/>
Subsequently, a religious bickering arose, and the <lb/>
government, yielding to strong pressure on behalf <lb/>
of Roman Catholics, revoked the grant, except on <lb/>
condition that the Bible should be entirely excluded <lb/>
from the institute. This condition, Miss Robinson, <lb/>
as a Protestant, was of course unable to accept, <lb/>
though it was never intended to force the Bible upon <lb/>
any one, but to have one room in the building <lb/>
specially reserved for a Bible-class, which the soldiers <lb/>
might attend or not at their discretion, the other <lb/>
advantages of the institute being equally open to all. <lb/>
<pb n="92" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0105"/>
How little of a grievance this could really be to any <lb/>
one, may be judged from the fact that the Roman <lb/>
Catholic soldiers at Woolwich voluntarily subscribed <lb/>
among themselves, and forwarded to Miss Robinson <lb/>
a sum of ten pounds on behalf of the institute.</p>
<p>Nothing daunted, however, by the loss of this <lb/>
gift, Miss Robinson set herself to collect funds for <lb/>
the purchase of suitable premises, and very shortly <lb/>
the well-known old <hi rend="italic">Fountain Hotel</hi>, in the High <lb/>
Street, Portsmouth, was secured, and after <reg orig="under-|going">undergoing</reg> <lb/>
the necessary alterations, the Soldiers' <reg orig="Insti-|tute">Institute</reg> <lb/>
was formally opened on September 10, 1874. <lb/>
Here Miss Robinson took up her abode, and <lb/>
personally superintended the management of the <lb/>
whole institution, which afforded ample scope for <lb/>
all her energy and power of organisation. The <lb/>
institution, which is intended to be a club for <lb/>
the military, is designed for amusement and <lb/>
society, and&mdash;for those who will&mdash;for instruction. <lb/>
Though it is wholly undenominational in character, <lb/>
and though it is not intended to force religion on <lb/>
anybody, means are provided for those who choose <lb/>
to avail themselves of them, of religious instruction <lb/>
and opportunities for private prayer. The building <lb/>
is well suited to the purpose for which it has <lb/>
been adapted. One young private is reported to <lb/>
have said, on going up to the reading-room: 'I say, <lb/>
come out of this, comrade; this must be for officers; <lb/>
they would never put down carpets for us.' <lb/>
Immediately opposite the entrance is a large bar, <lb/>
which is applied to the same use as formerly <lb/>
during the existence of the hotel. Those who desire <lb/>
light refreshment, or who have not time to sit <lb/>
<pb n="93" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0106"/>
down in the coffee-room, find tea and coffee ready <lb/>
there at all times. The coffee-room is the apartment <lb/>
chiefly used for social intercourse and refreshment. <lb/>
Here soldiers meet and make appointments with <lb/>
their friends, and the men are encouraged to bring <lb/>
their wives and sweethearts with them. It is a long <lb/>
room about forty feet by twenty, filled with small <lb/>
tables for refreshments, and in addition to <reg orig="news-|papers">newspapers</reg> <lb/>
is supplied with draughts, chess, and dominoes. <lb/>
It looks into the main street of Portsmouth, which <lb/>
gives it a cheerful and pleasant appearance. <reg orig="Ascend-|ing">Ascending</reg> <lb/>
to the next floor, we come to the reading-room, a <lb/>
large handsome apartment of the same dimensions as <lb/>
the coffee-room below, panelled with varnished oak, <lb/>
and lighted at night by two large gas chandeliers. <lb/>
Both as to the comfort of its fittings, and the <reg orig="admir-|able">admirable</reg> <lb/>
supply of papers and periodicals of all sorts with <lb/>
which it is stocked, this reading-room is one which <lb/>
any club might be proud to possess, and together <lb/>
with a well-supplied lending library, furnishes <reg orig="abund-|ance">abundance</reg> <lb/>
of literary food for those who frequent the <lb/>
institute.</p>
<p>On the same floor as this reading-room is the <lb/>
apartment which has given rise to so much <reg orig="con-|troversy&mdash;that">controversy&mdash;that</reg> <lb/>
for Bible-class meetings and religious <lb/>
instruction. It is free to all, but no one is pressed <lb/>
to attend it. It is just as entirely at the discretion <lb/>
of any one making use of the institute either to <lb/>
frequent this room or to keep out of it, as it is for a <lb/>
member of a London club to choose whether he will <lb/>
enter the billiard or smoking room. On the same <lb/>
floor is a bath-room, which is fitted up with hot <lb/>
and cold water baths, and other conveniences. A <lb/>
<pb n="94" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0107"/>
short distance off is a large room in which is held a <lb/>
sewing-class for soldiers' wives. The rooms on the <lb/>
upper floor are fitted up as dormitories with neat <lb/>
little iron beds and comfortable clean bedding, and <lb/>
are capable of accommodating nearly a hundred <lb/>
occupants when required. In another part of the <lb/>
building are rooms for the use of married soldiers <lb/>
and their wives and families, previous to embarking <lb/>
for foreign service, or on their return home. A <lb/>
man and his wife can have a good room for one <lb/>
shilling a night; single beds are sixpence only. <lb/>
During 1886 the large number of 2740 people slept <lb/>
at the institute. About a mile nearer the dockyard <lb/>
Miss Robinson has opened the 'Sailors' Welcome;' <lb/>
47,000 sailors slept there in 1886. In this place <lb/>
there is a smoking-room, with two large <reg orig="billiard-|tables">billiardtables</reg> <lb/>
and comfortable couches. The rooms here are <lb/>
called by different names, after those who have <lb/>
given money towards them. In order to encourage <lb/>
temperate habits, the Blue Ribbon Coffee Tavern <lb/>
was opened in Nobb's Lane, with a public laundry <lb/>
adjoining it.</p>
<p>In 1884, Miss Robinson was engaged in founding <lb/>
an institute at Alexandria, on a similar plan to that <lb/>
at Portsmouth, for the use of our soldiers in Egypt. <lb/>
Through the efforts of her manager, Mr Tufnell, <lb/>
Admiral Lord John Hay, General Earle, and others, <lb/>
she secured a piece of land for this purpose. The <lb/>
institute was opened in 1885, at a cost of &pound;16,000; <lb/>
a coffee-stand in connection with it was erected on <lb/>
the jetty. It is to be hoped that the noble example <lb/>
given by Miss Robinson will lead other workers to <lb/>
follow in her steps.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Somewhere</hi> about 1820, a young artist of <lb/>
no small promise resolutely bade Paris and <lb/>
his dreams of future celebrity a long <reg orig="fare-|well">farewell</reg>, <lb/>
to settle down as a drawing-master at Bordeaux; <lb/>
for in the old vinous city lived Raymond Bonheur's <lb/>
parents, poor, aged, and infirm, and to their <reg orig="mainten-|ance">maintenance</reg> <lb/>
and comfort the son nobly chose to devote <reg orig="him-|self">himself</reg>. <lb/>
This sacrifice on the shrine of filial duty was to <lb/>
be more than repaid by the purest domestic <reg orig="happi-|ness">happiness</reg>. <lb/>
Among his earliest pupils was a young girl <lb/>
from Altona, poor, like himself, but of a very <reg orig="pleas-|ing">pleasing</reg> <lb/>
person, and endowed with a good share of talent <lb/>
and energy. A tender relation speedily sprang up <lb/>
between master and scholar; the old people looked <lb/>
on approvingly, and, before long, Raymond brought <lb/>
his wife home to the humble household. Madame <lb/>
R. Bonheur, who was a good pianist, gave <reg orig="music-|lessons">musiclessons</reg>; <lb/>
the number of her husband's pupils steadily <lb/>
increased, and a family of four children, Rosalie, <lb/>
commonly called Rosa, Fran&ccedil;ois Auguste, Jules <lb/>
Isidore, Juliette, crowned the married happiness of <lb/>
the couple. Rosa, the eldest of these, and the <lb/>
subject of our sketch, was born March 22, 1822.</p>
<p>She was only ten years old when her father lost <lb/>
<pb n="98" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0111"/>
his wife, and, his parents being now dead, he <lb/>
decided, under the restlessness of his first grief, to <lb/>
transplant his family to Paris. Henceforth, the <lb/>
little ones seem to have passed a somewhat cheerless <lb/>
childhood. Their father's time was wholly engrossed <lb/>
by his professional duties; they had few <reg orig="oppor-|tunities">opportunities</reg> <lb/>
for finding new playfellows in place of those <lb/>
they had left behind, and a mother's tenderness <lb/>
was ill replaced by the care of an elderly <reg orig="house-|keeper">house-keeper</reg>, <lb/>
cross and somewhat tyrannical, as faithful <lb/>
old servants are apt to be towards children. As for <lb/>
Rosa, perhaps she suffered more than the others <lb/>
under this government. The child had all sorts of <lb/>
odd ways, which clashed dreadfully with old Nanon's <lb/>
notions of what was right. She made friends with <lb/>
the whole dog-and-cat population of the <reg orig="neighbour-|hood">neighbourhood</reg>. <lb/>
If she met cattle on the road to market, <lb/>
she would run into the midst of the drove, and pat <lb/>
them right and left, and, like luckless little Peepy, <lb/>
had a perfect mania for following sheep out of town. <lb/>
'A terrible child,' declared Nanon, 'who could be <lb/>
taught neither prayers nor catechism, and who had <lb/>
actually only learned her letters from a gray parrot <lb/>
which had a knack of repeating the alphabet.' The <lb/>
housekeeper, in despair over her charge, earnestly <lb/>
entreated that Rosa might be sent as day-boarder <lb/>
to the nuns of Chaillot. To the sisters Rosa <reg orig="accord-|ingly">accordingly</reg> <lb/>
went. Her attendance at school became sadly <lb/>
irregular, but no one, it seems, interfered for <reg orig="correc-|tion">correction</reg>. <lb/>
The truth was, that the child found a way, <lb/>
though by no means the nearest to school, which led <lb/>
through the Bois de Boulogne, not at that time trim <lb/>
and artificial, as in the present day, but a real wood, <lb/>
<pb n="99" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0112"/>
with stately forest trees and wild tangles of <reg orig="under-|growth">undergrowth</reg>. <lb/>
Here, hour after hour, the future painter <lb/>
would linger alone, unconsciously drinking in lessons <lb/>
far more to the purpose, we fancy, than any a <reg orig="con-|vent">convent</reg> <lb/>
school-room could afford.</p>
<p>Years passed on; Rosa was now fifteen, and her <lb/>
father thought it high time she should be put into <lb/>
some way of earning her bread. He naturally <reg orig="con-|sulted">consulted</reg> <lb/>
the sisters of Chaillot. They reported their <lb/>
pupil to be a strange girl, of whom nothing could <lb/>
be made: she had very little power, they said, of <lb/>
acquiring knowledge, and it would be sheer waste <lb/>
of time and money to educate her for a governess; <lb/>
the only thing on earth to which she might be put <lb/>
was perhaps needlework of some sort. Before M. <lb/>
Bonheur left the convent parlour, and without the <lb/>
least reference to Rosa's own ideas on the subject, <lb/>
he had decided upon placing her with a dressmaker. <lb/>
This apprenticeship, however, only lasted one week; <lb/>
at the end of that time, her father, calling to see his <lb/>
daughter, was startled to find her looking wretchedly <lb/>
ill, and was, moreover, touched to the heart when <lb/>
the motherless girl, throwing her arms round his <lb/>
neck in an agony of tears, besought her release. M. <lb/>
Bonheur had the good sense to take her away at <lb/>
once. But not the less heavily did the poor <reg orig="drawing-|master">drawing-master</reg> <lb/>
sigh over this fresh burden added to his cares, <lb/>
as, with Rosa on his arm, he walked home through <lb/>
those bustling Paris streets. Almost in despair, he <lb/>
looked down at the swarthy brow, the strongly <lb/>
marked lines of the young face beside him. This <lb/>
portionless girl, who could never hope to be married <lb/>
for her beauty, and of whom neither housekeeper, <lb/>
<pb n="100" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0113"/>
governess, nor dressmaker could be made&mdash;what in <lb/>
the world was a poor man to do with such an <lb/>
impracticable subject? Had his wife been still <lb/>
living, no doubt all painful perplexities of the kind <lb/>
might have been spared; her quick-sighted, maternal <lb/>
instinct would, ere this, have divined those artistic <lb/>
tendencies which, up to the present time, were a <lb/>
secret alike to the father and to Rosa herself.</p>
<p>M. Bonheur decided to meet the difficult question, <lb/>
or rather to postpone it for a year to come, by <lb/>
placing the young lady in a good school, where his <lb/>
services were taken as an equivalent. For the first <lb/>
time in her life, Rosa entered the drawing-class, and, <lb/>
to her father's delighted surprise, she speedily <reg orig="out-|stripped">outstripped</reg> <lb/>
her companions, though progressing as <lb/>
little as ever in what school advertisements sum <lb/>
up as the usual branches of a polite education. <lb/>
The year ended, Rosa asked his permission to return <lb/>
home, and devote herself entirely to the studio. M. <lb/>
Bonheur, who had by this time received abundant <lb/>
proofs of her talent, gladly consented; she became <lb/>
his favourite pupil, and brought to her work all the <lb/>
energy of a mind which had struggled into freedom; <lb/>
all that patience and zeal which are the true tokens <lb/>
of genius. Not that our artist was at once to <lb/>
discover her peculiar vocation. That strong tendency <lb/>
towards the ideal, always so seductive to the feminine <lb/>
intellect till it has learned the measure of its powers, <lb/>
led Rosa to the exclusive study of high art. She <lb/>
copied daily in the Louvre, her imagination fired by <lb/>
the grandeur and majesty of the great masters, and <lb/>
hardly vouchsafed a glance at the cattle-pieces of <lb/>
Paul Potter, Cuyp, and other artists of the same <lb/>
<pb n="101" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0114"/>
school, among whose noble brotherhood she was <reg orig="her-|self">herself</reg> <lb/>
to be enrolled. The director of the Louvre said <lb/>
to her, 'I have never seen an example of such <reg orig="appli-|cation">application</reg> <lb/>
and such ardour for work;' while an English <lb/>
gentleman stopped beside her easel, and said, 'Your <lb/>
copy, my child, is superb, faultless. Persevere as <lb/>
you have begun, and I prophesy that you will be a <lb/>
great artist.' Two years of laborious painstaking, <lb/>
however, sufficed to teach her that no place had <lb/>
been kept for her in the lofty region of high <lb/>
art. Dark hours of self-distrust and self-torture <lb/>
followed the unwelcome discovery, till, shut up in <lb/>
her solitary attic, the young aspirant bitterly <reg orig="ques-|tioned">questioned</reg> <lb/>
whether nature might not, after all, have <lb/>
bestowed upon her no better capacity for art than <lb/>
for dressmaking. Perhaps each one of us might <lb/>
recall, in his or her personal history, a season of <lb/>
unusual depression, when memory, as if with a <lb/>
generous effort to relieve the fancy, has conjured up <lb/>
some bright scene from the past for us, with the <lb/>
vividness of a photograph. A similar experience <lb/>
broke through Rosa's listless gloom. On a sudden <lb/>
there flashed upon the young girl, who had no doubt <lb/>
been pent too long in a populous city, the vision of one <lb/>
splendid summer day, when she had played <lb/>
truant in the Bois de Boulogne. Yielding to the <lb/>
impulse of the moment, she seized a pencil, sketched <lb/>
out the ideal landscape as it rose before her, and had <lb/>
learned, once and for all, the true bent of her genius. <lb/>
The very next morning, with characteristic decision, <lb/>
Rosa had turned her back on the Louvre, and was <lb/>
walking off, brushes and palette in hand, two miles <lb/>
away into the country, to sketch from nature.</p>
<pb n="102" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0115"/>
<p>'Every way to the right goal is right,' Goethe <lb/>
tells us, 'from all points of the compass.' And thus <lb/>
Rosa Bonheur had the satisfaction of finding her <lb/>
honest hard work at the Louvre by no means thrown <lb/>
away. From those severe studies of the <reg orig="master-|works">masterworks</reg> <lb/>
of art she brought a clearer eye, a deeper <lb/>
insight, and a wiser love for nature. Occasionally <lb/>
she exchanged her easel for a modelling apparatus, <lb/>
and moulded groups of animals as she saw them <lb/>
in the fields. These efforts at plastic art, with no <lb/>
guidance beyond that of natural aptitude and <reg orig="invent-|tive">inventtive</reg> <lb/>
power, must have been accomplished with great <lb/>
difficulty. Her practice in this kindred branch of <lb/>
art has been highly valuable to her as a painter; <lb/>
especially has she thereby attained that firm and <lb/>
subtle hand in execution, which is too rare a quality <lb/>
among female artists.</p>
<p>Winter, of course, interrupted these outdoor <lb/>
studies; she then divided her time between such <lb/>
sketches as she could make in a stable belonging <lb/>
to an abattoir, and careful study of the best animal <lb/>
painters in the Louvre. One living creature, too, <lb/>
Rosa possessed, which served both for model and <lb/>
companion&mdash;a pet sheep, she had bought as a lamb, <lb/>
and contrived, somehow, to keep fat and flourishing <lb/>
in a corner of her attic on the sixth story. In such <lb/>
wise she lived, working for very small gains, but <lb/>
always steadily working. The young artist, then <reg orig="nine-|teen">nineteen</reg>, <lb/>
was for the first time represented by two small <lb/>
pieces, 'Two Rabbits' &lpar;1840&rpar; and 'Goats and Sheep,' <lb/>
in the Paris Exhibition of 1841. After that date, her <lb/>
pictures appeared annually in the salon. The very <lb/>
high order of merit in the drawing, and the technical <lb/>
<pb n="103" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0116"/>
skill they displayed, were acknowledged by <reg orig="con-|noisseurs,but">connoisseurs,but</reg> <lb/>
for the public in general they seemed <lb/>
to have few attractions until after 1849. During <lb/>
the previous summer, Rosa had at last escaped <lb/>
from her long imprisonment in the capital, and <lb/>
now, from the breezy pastures of Auvergne, she <lb/>
sent a canvas glowing with the life and inspiration <lb/>
of nature. Horace Vernet himself pronounced her <lb/>
'Cantal Oxen' to be the best picture of its kind in the <lb/>
salon, and his opinion was endorsed by the admiring <lb/>
crowd who gathered round it day after day. Our <lb/>
painter had achieved the true triumph of art; she <lb/>
had satisfied both the connoisseur and the multitude. <lb/>
Horace Vernet presented her, in the name of the <lb/>
Provisional Government, with a magnificent S&egrave;vres <lb/>
vase, besides the gold medal of the first class awarded <lb/>
to the picture; and an English gentleman gave a <lb/>
solid proof of his appreciation by purchasing it for <lb/>
&pound;600. The 'Cantal Oxen' lie ruminating in a state of <lb/>
dull dreamy content, which is admirably expressed. <lb/>
The lines of the bones and movement of the muscles <lb/>
under their hides; the play of light and shadow over <lb/>
their comely backs and broad haunches; the breath, <lb/>
the white foam, the drowsy motion of the lower <lb/>
jaws&mdash;every minute detail has been perfectly given. <lb/>
The creatures are grouped in the foreground of a <lb/>
landscape, simple, appropriate, and faithful to nature. <lb/>
The sky is a bright breezy blue, through which floats <lb/>
one exquisite web of summer-cloud.</p>
<p>Her great picture. 'Oxen ploughing near <reg orig="Niver-|nais">Nivernais</reg>,' <lb/>
was completed in 1849, and exhibited in the <lb/>
International Exhibition of 1851. Many an English <lb/>
rustic paid it there the honest compliment of staring <lb/>
<pb n="104" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0117"/>
wide-mouthed approbation; and this recalls a <hi rend="italic"><reg orig="bon&acirc;-|fide">bon&acirc;fide</reg></hi> <lb/>
criticism, more to the point, perhaps, than <reg orig="any-|thing">anything</reg> <lb/>
the present writer could find to say concerning <lb/>
its merits. During the Exhibition, on a certain <lb/>
sweltering day between haytime and harvest, a <lb/>
gigantic farmer from the Fens, where agriculturists <lb/>
and water-beetles respectively arrive at amazing <lb/>
size, was watched as he contemplated the picture <lb/>
aforesaid. Presently plunging into the crowd, back <lb/>
he came, dragging a flustered female on his arm. <lb/>
'Lookee, Becky,' roared Bucolicus, his jolly fist so <lb/>
near the canvas as to draw the attention of <reg orig="police-|man">police-man</reg> <lb/>
X<gap desc="long dash" reason="missing" id="g1"/>, 'lookee, <hi rend="italic">picturs</hi> here be about as cheap <lb/>
as rats in a granary; but <hi rend="italic">them's</hi> beastses, Becky, <lb/>
and <hi rend="italic">that's</hi> ploughing!' Great as the popularity <lb/>
of Rosa Bonheur's 'Horse-fair' has been, the '<reg orig="Plough-|ing">Ploughing</reg> <lb/>
near Nivernais,' and its companion picture, <lb/>
'Haymaking,' now both in the Luxembourg, rank <lb/>
perhaps higher in artistic merit.</p>
<p>Her famous picture of the 'Horse-fair,' which she <lb/>
exhibited in the Paris Salon of 1856, was the result <lb/>
of much preparatory study; it was sold to an <lb/>
English gentleman, and afterwards purchased by <lb/>
A. T. Stewart of New York for his famous <reg orig="collec-|tion">collection</reg>. <lb/>
It entitled her, as the official announcement <lb/>
stated, to the cross of the Legion of Honour, but for <lb/>
her sex. Sir Edwin Landseer is reported to have <lb/>
said of her 'Horse-fair,' 'It surpasses me, though <lb/>
it's a little hard to be beaten by a woman.' It was <lb/>
not till 1865 that the French government thought fit <lb/>
to recognise the abilities of the artist by bestowing <lb/>
upon her the cross. An anecdote is related of the <lb/>
manner in which she received this decoration from <lb/>
<pb n="105" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0118"/>
the Empress Eugenie. The emperor leaving Paris <lb/>
for a short excursion in 1865, left the empress as <lb/>
regent. From the imperial residence at <reg orig="Fontaine-|bleau">Fontainebleau</reg> <lb/>
it was only a short drive to By &lpar;the home of <lb/>
Mademoiselle Bonheur&rpar;. Unannounced the empress <lb/>
entered the studio, where Mademoiselle Rosa was at <lb/>
work. She rose to receive the visitor, who threw <lb/>
her arms about her neck and kissed her. It was <lb/>
only a short interview. The imperial vision had <lb/>
departed; the rumble of the carriage and the <lb/>
crack of the outriders' whips were lost in the <lb/>
distance. Then, and not till then, did the artist <lb/>
discover that as the empress had given the kiss, <lb/>
she had pinned upon her blouse the cross of <lb/>
the Legion of Honour. So the honour came at last, <lb/>
although Napoleon III. had not previously had the <lb/>
courage to bestow it upon her. Previous to painting <lb/>
this picture, which is thought by some art critics to <lb/>
be the best work she has ever produced, she regularly <lb/>
visited the horse-market of Paris.</p>
<p>In 1849, her father, Raymond Bonheur, had been <lb/>
appointed by the French government director of the <lb/>
Female School of Design, but he did not live to <lb/>
enjoy this honour long: he was carried off in the <lb/>
same year by cholera. His daughter Rosa was <lb/>
appointed his successor, and her sister Juliette <reg orig="be-|came">became</reg> <lb/>
a teacher in the school. Raymond Bonheur, <lb/>
on his deathbed, left his younger children to their <lb/>
sister's care, and the trust was nobly fulfilled. <lb/>
Fran&ccedil;ois Auguste &lpar;died in 1880&rpar; followed her steps <lb/>
as landscape and animal painter, and received the <lb/>
cross of the Legion of Honour two years after Rosa. <lb/>
Her second brother, Jules Isidore, is well known as <lb/>
<pb n="106" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0119"/>
an animal sculptor. Her sister Juliette, born at Paris <lb/>
in 1830, also became a painter.</p>
<p>Rosa Bonheur's residence in Paris for years was <lb/>
an old-fashioned house in the Rue d'Assas, with a <lb/>
large courtyard attached. Entering this, you found <lb/>
a farmyard in the heart of the city; round it were <lb/>
stables and cattle-sheds; in the middle a good-sized <lb/>
piece of pasture was inclosed, where sheep, goats, <lb/>
and heifers browsed together on the best of terms. <lb/>
Latterly she has lived in the Chateau By, near <lb/>
Fontainebleau. When the German army laid siege <lb/>
to Paris, orders were issued to the soldiers by the <lb/>
Crown Prince, that her chateau and paintings were <lb/>
to be protected.</p>
<p>In the <hi rend="italic">Century Magazine</hi>, Mr Henry Bacon has <lb/>
given an interesting, graphic account of the chateau <lb/>
and its inmates. He says, 'The chateau dates from <lb/>
the time of Louis XV., and the garden is still laid out <lb/>
in the style of Le N&ocirc;tre. Since it has been in the <lb/>
present proprietor's possession, a quaint, picturesque <lb/>
brick building, containing the carriage-house and <lb/>
coachman's lodge on the first floor, and the studio <lb/>
on the second, has been added; the roof of the main <lb/>
building has been raised, and the chapel changed <lb/>
into an orangery: beside the main carriage entrance, <lb/>
which is closed by iron gates and wooden blinds, is <lb/>
a postern gate, with a small grated opening, like <lb/>
those found in convents. The blinds to the gate <lb/>
and the slide to the grating are generally closed, and <lb/>
the only communication with the outside world is by <lb/>
the bell-wire, terminating in a ring beside the gate. <lb/>
Ring, and the jingle of the bell is at once echoed by <lb/>
the barking of numerous dogs&mdash;the hounds and <lb/>
<pb n="107" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0120"/>
bassets in chorus, the grand St Bernard in slow <lb/>
measure, like the bass-drum in an orchestra. After <lb/>
the first excitement among the dogs has begun to <lb/>
abate, a remarkably small house-pet that has been <lb/>
somewhere in the interior arrives upon the scene, <lb/>
and with his sharp, shrill voice again starts and <lb/>
leads the canine chorus. By this time the eagle in <lb/>
his cage has awakened, and the parrot, whose cage <lb/>
is built into the corner of the studio looking upon <lb/>
the street, adds to the racket. Behind the house is <lb/>
a large park divided from the forest by a high wall; <lb/>
a lawn and flower-beds are laid out near the <reg orig="build-|ings">buildings</reg>, <lb/>
and on the lawn, in pleasant weather, graze a <lb/>
magnificent bull and cow, which are kept as models. <lb/>
In a wire inclosure are two chamois from the <lb/>
Pyrenees, and farther removed from the house, in <lb/>
the wooded part of the park, are inclosures for sheep <lb/>
and deer, each of which knows its mistress. Even <lb/>
the stag, bearing its six-branched antlers, receives <lb/>
her caresses like a pet dog. At the end of one of <lb/>
the linden avenues is a splendid bronze, by Isidore <lb/>
Bonheur, of a Gaul attacking a lion.</p>
<p>'The studio is very large, with a large chimney at <lb/>
one end, the supports of which are life-size dogs, <lb/>
modelled by Isidore Bonheur. Portraits of the <lb/>
father and mother in oval frames hang at each side, <lb/>
and a pair of gigantic horns ornament the centre. <lb/>
The room is decorated with stuffed heads of animals <lb/>
of various kinds&mdash;boars, bears, wolves, and oxen; <lb/>
and birds perch on every convenient place.'</p>
<p>While conversing with a friend who came to see <lb/>
her at her studio, she said: 'I have been a faithful <lb/>
student since I was ten years old. I have copied no <lb/>
<pb n="108" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0121"/>
master. I have studied nature, and expressed to the <lb/>
best of my ability the ideas and feelings with which <lb/>
she has inspired me. Art is an absorbent&mdash;a tyrant. <lb/>
It demands heart, brain, soul, body; the entireness of <lb/>
the votary. Nothing less will win its highest favour. <lb/>
I wed art. It is my husband, my world, my <reg orig="life-|dream">lifedream</reg>, <lb/>
the air I breathe. I know nothing else, feel <lb/>
nothing else, think nothing else. My soul finds in it <lb/>
the most complete satisfaction. I have no taste for <lb/>
general society&mdash;no interest in its frivolities. I only <lb/>
seek to be known through my works. If the world <lb/>
feels I understand them, I have succeeded.&hellip; If I <lb/>
had got up a convention to debate the question of <lb/>
my ability to paint "The Horse Fair," for which <lb/>
England paid me forty thousand francs &lpar;&pound;1583&rpar;, <lb/>
the decision would have been against me. I felt <lb/>
the power within me to paint; I cultivated it, and <lb/>
have produced works that have won the favourable <lb/>
verdicts of the great judges. I have no patience <lb/>
with women who ask permission to think.'</p>
<p>Rosa Bonheur regularly visits the slaughter-houses <lb/>
and stables of Paris, and the fairs in the surrounding <lb/>
districts, to study the structure and habits of the <lb/>
domestic animals under those varying circumstances <lb/>
which she has so faithfully depicted on her canvas. <lb/>
She finds it more convenient to dress in male attire <lb/>
when visiting these places, where none but men are <lb/>
employed, who by their occupation cannot be of a <lb/>
refined nature. She has always been treated by them <lb/>
in a courteous and obliging manner, however. Rosa <lb/>
Bonheur donned this costume while travelling across <lb/>
the Pyrenees and in the Highlands of Scotland, where <lb/>
she painted some beautiful pictures which have added <lb/>

<pb entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0123"/>
<pb n="111" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0124"/>
greatly to her fame as an artist. While in the <lb/>
Pyrenees, she painted 'The Young Shepherd of the <lb/>
Pyrenees guarding his Flock,' and the 'Bouricairos <lb/>
crossing the Pyrenees;' in Scotland, 'Denizens of the <lb/>
Highlands,' 'Morning in the Highlands,' and '<reg orig="Cross-|ing">Crossing</reg> <lb/>
a Loch in the Highlands.'</p>
<p>We are told that she dresses very simply, always <lb/>
wearing black, brown, or gray, with a close-fitting <lb/>
jacket over a plain skirt. When she accepts a social <lb/>
invitation, which is very seldom, she adorns her <lb/>
dress with a lace collar, but without other ornament. <lb/>
Her usual working dress is a long gray linen or <lb/>
blue flannel blouse, reaching nearly from head to <lb/>
foot. She is small in stature, with dainty hands and <lb/>
feet, blue eyes, and a noble and intelligent face. She <lb/>
is a great worker, rising commonly at six in the <lb/>
morning, and painting throughout the day.</p>
<p>Rosa Bonheur sent two pictures, 'On the Alert,' <lb/>
and 'A Foraging Party,' to the Antwerp Academy <lb/>
in 1879. They were also exhibited in London in <lb/>
1881, and in the following year the 'Lion at Home,' <lb/>
the result of the study of a pair of Nubian lions <lb/>
presented to her by a friend. The king of Belgium <lb/>
presented her with the Leopold Cross of Honour in <lb/>
1880, and the king of Spain in the same year <reg orig="con-|ferred">conferred</reg> <lb/>
on her the commander's cross of the Royal <lb/>
Order of Isabella the Catholic, in each case this being <lb/>
the first time that these decorations had been <reg orig="con-|ferred">conferred</reg> <lb/>
upon a lady. Amongst the best known of her <lb/>
pictures, not previously mentioned, are 'Eve and her <lb/>
Lamb surprised by a Storm,' 'A Farmer of Auvergne,' <lb/>
'Chalk Wagon of the Limousin,' 'A Stampede,' <lb/>
'Charcoal Burners in a Forest,' 'An Old Monarch,' <lb/>
<pb n="112" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0125"/>
'Londais Peasants going to Water,' 'Fontainebleau,' <lb/>
'The Three Musketeers,' and 'A Scottish Raid,' all of <lb/>
which are familiar to the public through engravings <lb/>
and lithographs.</p>
<p>Her pictures are eminently calculated to enlarge <lb/>
our enjoyment of outdoor nature; this she presents to <lb/>
us precisely as it appears, not perhaps to every eye, <lb/>
but to that of the painter. There is no conventional <lb/>
arrangement, no vicious over-elaboration, no <reg orig="pre-|tension">pretension</reg> <lb/>
whatever, not so much as a pretension to <lb/>
simplicity. What she gives us is true, wholesome <lb/>
reality, as observed with a clear eye, and set forth <lb/>
by a skilful hand.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Among</hi> the men who distinguished themselves <lb/>
as sanitary improvers during this century, a <lb/>
prominent place must ever be given to Dr <lb/>
Thomas Southwood Smith, who was unceasing in his <lb/>
endeavours to agitate the subject of town <reg orig="improve-|ment">improvement</reg> <lb/>
in the interests of health. Drawing attention <lb/>
to the bad condition of Bethnal Green and adjoining <lb/>
districts in the metropolis, Dr Smith never desisted <lb/>
till all this was changed. As an encouragement to <lb/>
sanitary reformers of the present day, we may briefly <lb/>
tell what he was able to effect.</p>
<p>In 1844, the Health of Towns Association held <lb/>
its first public meeting. Lord Normanby, though <lb/>
defeated in 1841 and 1844, got the Health of Towns <lb/>
Act passed in 1848. In 1846 Dr Smith established <lb/>
that Metropolitan Association for the Improvement <lb/>
of the Dwellings of the Industrial Classes, which <lb/>
was the forerunner of all the Peabody, Waterloo, <lb/>
and other associations with which we have become <lb/>
so familiar. In 1855 he could report that in London, <lb/>
remittent fever, ague, and malignant sore throat were <lb/>
things of the past. And in 1861 he could die <lb/>
contented, having seen seven millions of the public <lb/>
<pb n="114" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0127"/>
money devoted to sanitary reform. One who knew <lb/>
his indefatigable labours in the cause, reports that <lb/>
in a district of seventy-five thousand population, <lb/>
only forty-one cases of fever and one hundred and <lb/>
nine of febricula came under notice. In Bethnal <lb/>
Green and Whitechapel the drainage is as good as <lb/>
in Marylebone or Belgravia; the houses are supplied <lb/>
with water, and open gutters are done away, and <lb/>
courts are paved.</p>
<p>Dr Smith worked even as he thought, on a grand <lb/>
scale; nothing short of sweeping and sufficient <lb/>
reforms could content him. How successful the <lb/>
reforms then inaugurated have been, the present <lb/>
condition of East London at this moment, as <reg orig="com-|pared">compared</reg> <lb/>
with sixty years ago, affords ample testimony. <lb/>
And yet, let any one pass through <hi rend="italic">any</hi> of the closer <lb/>
courts and alleys with which not Whitechapel alone, <lb/>
but our whole metropolis, is intersected, and he will <lb/>
perceive that evils remain with which sanitary <lb/>
reformers and building societies are unable to <lb/>
grapple. It was quite true that to house people <lb/>
better was a first and imperative step towards the <lb/>
prevention of disease and death; that to give light <lb/>
and air and water was imperative, if any <reg orig="improve-|ment">improvement</reg> <lb/>
in the physical condition of the people was to <lb/>
be made. But there was, as there generally is, <lb/>
another side to the question, and it was this: the <lb/>
destructive habits of the classes belonging to the <lb/>
lowest stratum of society render them totally unfit <lb/>
to be the occupants of model lodging-houses. To <lb/>
say nothing of the little fact that these classes could <lb/>
not easily be induced to occupy them, they would <lb/>
cease to be model lodging-houses if they did. <reg orig="Dust-|bins">Dustbins</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="115" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0128"/>
utterly unapproachable; cabbage-leaves, and <lb/>
rotting fish, and every kind of dirt lying in the <lb/>
passages and on the stairs&mdash;the stairs themselves <lb/>
often inches thick with dirt; good drains rendered <lb/>
useless by being stuffed up, locks wrenched from <lb/>
doors, taps spoiled, and windows broken, are all <lb/>
characteristic features in the lives of certain <lb/>
classes, who are men and our brothers for all that, <lb/>
and the shame of much of whose ignorance and <lb/>
degradation lies at our own doors.</p>
<p>Miss Octavia Hill, in her <hi rend="italic">Homes of the London <lb/>
Poor</hi>, records how some of these difficulties on a <lb/>
considerable scale have been met and overcome <lb/>
in a large district in London; the means used, and <lb/>
the results at present attained. Miss Hill, born about <lb/>
1838, is the grand-daughter of Dr Southwood Smith. <lb/>
Early in life she began her philanthropic work <lb/>
amongst the poor, under the superintendence of the <lb/>
Rev. Frederick Denison Maurice; but it was not till <lb/>
she was about twenty-five that she interested <reg orig="her-|self">herself</reg> <lb/>
in the dwellings of the poor of London. She <lb/>
saw that there was need for an entirely new system <lb/>
of management and supervision in the houses let to <lb/>
the swarming population of our courts, if any real <lb/>
good was to be done; an army of volunteers was <lb/>
wanted, if the work was to be done effectually; and <lb/>
if it was to be done on a wide scale, it was essential <lb/>
that it should not be merely philanthropical, but <lb/>
that houses let under the new conditions should pay. <lb/>
Having arrived at this conclusion, Miss Hill in 1864 <lb/>
consulted Mr Ruskin, whose dreams have generally <lb/>
a practical basis. He at once risked three thousand <lb/>
pounds in the experiment, and with the money three <lb/>
<pb n="116" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0129"/>
tenements in Marylebone were purchased&mdash;well-built <lb/>
houses, but in a dreadful state of dirt and neglect. <lb/>
The courts in which this experiment was to be tried <lb/>
were known, in a satirical sense, to the inhabitants <lb/>
of the surrounding districts as 'Paradise' and '<reg orig="Fresh-|water">Freshwater</reg>.' <lb/>
The place swarmed with vermin; the paper, <lb/>
black with dirt, hung in long strips from the walls; <lb/>
the drains were stopped, the water-supply out of <lb/>
order. All these things were put in order, but no <lb/>
new appliances of any kind were added, it being <lb/>
determined that the tenants should wait for these <lb/>
till they had proved themselves capable of taking <lb/>
care of them. A regular sum was set aside for <lb/>
repairs, and this was equally divided between the <lb/>
houses. If any of it remained, after breakages and <lb/>
damages had been repaired, at the end of the <lb/>
quarter, each tenant was to decide in what way the <lb/>
surplus should be spent, so as to add to the comforts <lb/>
of the house. 'This plan,' says Miss Hill, 'worked <lb/>
admirably; the loss from carelessness decreased to <lb/>
an amazing extent. And the tenants prized the <lb/>
comforts they seemed in some measure to have <lb/>
earned.'</p>
<p>Punctuality in collecting rents is one of the first <lb/>
principles enforced, and a lady collector and <reg orig="super-|visor">supervisor</reg> <lb/>
substituted for the 'resident landlady,' whose <lb/>
influence too often is of a wholly injurious kind. <lb/>
Miss Hill in her <hi rend="italic">Homes of the London Poor</hi> quotes <lb/>
instances, but too familiar to all who are acquainted <lb/>
with such property, in which intemperance is really <lb/>
a passport to favour; and the lodger who will drink <lb/>
most with his landlord&mdash;who is often the small <lb/>
publican of the court&mdash;has the best chance of his <lb/>
<pb n="117" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0130"/>
debt for rent being long borne with. But Miss Hill <lb/>
quotes a worse case in which a small undertaker was <lb/>
the landlord. The man lived some little distance <lb/>
from his property, and confined his dealing with it <lb/>
to somewhat fruitless endeavours to collect the rents <lb/>
on a Sunday morning. In discussing the value of <lb/>
the property with her, he said, very <reg orig="straightfor-|wardly">straightforwardly</reg>: <lb/>
'Yes miss, of course there are plenty of <lb/>
bad debts. It's not the rents I look to, but the <lb/>
deaths I get out of the houses.' The man meant <lb/>
nothing but the ghastly fact he stated, that the <lb/>
deaths yielded him profit enough. And Miss Hill, <lb/>
looking at the condition of the people and property <lb/>
referred to, found 'a truth ringing with awful irony <lb/>
through his words.'</p>
<p>Another principle steadily enforced under her <lb/>
system was to allow no <hi rend="italic">underground</hi> lodgers; the <lb/>
former occupants of the cellars had to go, or were <lb/>
induced to take a room on the ground-floor. This <lb/>
arrangement was in itself a great civilising step. <lb/>
Then to help the people to help themselves; to <lb/>
allow no bad debts&mdash;the tenant who cannot or will <lb/>
not pay must go; to induce the people to save; <lb/>
to employ the tenants in slack seasons&mdash;all this <lb/>
was the work of the rent-collector.</p>
<p>One of the worst courts in Marylebone, which was <lb/>
principally inhabited by costermongers, hawkers, and <lb/>
the vagrant class, came under Miss Hill's <reg orig="manage-|ment">management</reg>. <lb/>
The houses were all crowded with inmates, <lb/>
and were in a deplorable condition&mdash;the plaster was <lb/>
dropping from the walls; the staircases were perfectly <lb/>
dark, the banisters gone, having been burnt as <reg orig="fire-|wood">firewood</reg> <lb/>
by the tenants. The wash-house, full of lumber <lb/>
<pb n="118" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0131"/>
belonging to the landlord, was locked up. The <reg orig="dust-|bin">dustbin</reg> <lb/>
in front of the houses was accessible to the whole <lb/>
neighbourhood. The state of the drainage was in <lb/>
keeping with everything else. One large but dirty <lb/>
water-butt received the water laid on for the houses. <lb/>
It leaked, and those who did not fill their jugs when <lb/>
the water came in, or had no jugs to fill, had no <lb/>
water. This court came under Miss Hill's <reg orig="manage-|ment">management</reg> <lb/>
in 1869, through the instrumentality of two <lb/>
ladies who placed twelve ten-roomed houses at her <lb/>
disposal. Miss Hill at once adopted the plan of <lb/>
weekly rents, to be paid in advance, which she <lb/>
rigidly enforced, and by this means knowing that <lb/>
there was no risk of bad debts, was able to let the <lb/>
property to tenants at a reasonable rate. The place <lb/>
was made to pay itself for new grates and new <lb/>
windows; the drains were put in order, a slate <lb/>
cistern fixed, the yard and foot-path paved, <reg orig="stair-|cases">staircases</reg> <lb/>
repaired; and&mdash;what is the real point of the <lb/>
whole&mdash;the tenants for the most part being the same <lb/>
people who lived under the disorder and discomfort <lb/>
of the old r&eacute;gime. This property realised an interest <lb/>
of five per cent. on all capital invested in the <reg orig="under-|taking">undertaking</reg>. <lb/>
A large room was built for the use of the <lb/>
tenants, where they could assemble on various <lb/>
occasions. It served as a club-room, as a place for <lb/>
boys' or girls' evening classes; and on Saturday <lb/>
evenings Miss Hill or a lady substitute usually <lb/>
attended to collect the savings of the tenants, or <lb/>
helped them in a variety of ways, such as finding <lb/>
work for those who wanted it, suggesting where <lb/>
places might be obtained, &amp;c.</p>
<p>The elder girls were gradually educated to scrub <lb/>
<pb n="119" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0132"/>
passages and staircases for the general benefit, and <lb/>
were remunerated for their trouble.</p>
<p>The scheme succeeded so well, that, in a few years, <lb/>
they were enabled to gradually pull down the old <lb/>
buildings and erect in their place new tenements, <lb/>
which are now known as St Christopher's Buildings. <lb/>
Light airy balconies were built along each flat, and <lb/>
a play-ground was formed for the children.</p>
<p>Mr Bowker, an American writer, gives a very <lb/>
interesting account of this lady and her work <lb/>
amongst the poor of London. He says: 'I went one <lb/>
day to see Miss Octavia Hill, and I learned <reg orig="some-|thing">something</reg> <lb/>
of her work from herself &lpar;and her books&rpar; and <lb/>
something of herself from her friends. She is a <lb/>
keen, bright, pleasant, vigorous, little woman, now <lb/>
scarcely above forty, and lives in Marylebone parish, <lb/>
not far from where the old parish church looks out <lb/>
through York Gate, upon the pleasant expanse of <lb/>
Regent Park, with its costly terraces; not far, also <lb/>
from some of the worst slums of London. For it is <lb/>
one of the characteristics of great Babylon that its <lb/>
palaces and its slums jostle each other. Miss Hill's <lb/>
home is a capacious house, plain but prettily <reg orig="decor-|ated">decorated</reg> <lb/>
as one enters, in which an elder sister and <lb/>
herself have their school. At the back is an <reg orig="exten-|sion">extension</reg>, <lb/>
built almost at the commencement of her work, <lb/>
to provide a large room where she might meet her <lb/>
people.</p>
<p>'Miss Hill's every-day work is to teach drawing <lb/>
and Latin. It is in addition to this that she has <lb/>
found time to institute the work by which she is <lb/>
best known; to centre in herself the relieving work <lb/>
of one of the most important parishes of London, to <lb/>
<pb n="120" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0133"/>
promote the Kyrle Society, of which she is treasurer; <lb/>
to write the considerable number of papers which in <lb/>
propagation of her work she has contributed to <lb/>
periodicals and made up into her books, as well <lb/>
as the annual <hi rend="italic">Letter to My Fellow-workers</hi>, in <lb/>
which she makes reports of progress; and to do the <lb/>
thousand other good works for which idle women <lb/>
cannot find time, and stronger than she have not <lb/>
strength, and richer than she have not money. For <lb/>
it is to the further credit of Miss Hill&mdash;I say it not <lb/>
to her compliment, but to the encouragement of <lb/>
others&mdash;that she is not and has not been a rich <lb/>
woman. Nor did the means of her work come to <lb/>
her at first unsought. She has had to earn her <lb/>
opportunities at every step. But when she left <lb/>
England a few years since for needed rest, she <reg orig="trans-|ferred">transferred</reg> <lb/>
back to her fellow-workers &pound;74,000 of <reg orig="pro-|perty">property</reg> <lb/>
that had been under the management.'</p>
<p>There is nothing Utopian in Miss Hill's scheme; <lb/>
only a gradual training of a rough population into <lb/>
habits of order, cleanliness, and self-respect. The <lb/>
great difficulty of the plan is the need for earnest <lb/>
volunteer workers, educated women, bright and <lb/>
active, who will patiently week by week take some <lb/>
portion of the work on their own shoulders; for <lb/>
there are hundreds of courts with a teeming <reg orig="popula-|tion">population</reg> <lb/>
which would immensely benefit by such an <lb/>
organisation. As the work has widened out, the <lb/>
question has not unnaturally arisen: If volunteer <lb/>
work can accomplish so much, and the better <reg orig="train-|ing">training</reg> <lb/>
of the people remedy so many existing evils&mdash; <lb/>
physical evils, we mean&mdash;is there need for state <lb/>
interference? For some time, Miss Hill hoped for <lb/>
<pb n="121" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0134"/>
success from the gradual spread of individual effort; <lb/>
but as the work widened, its enormous magnitude <lb/>
dawned upon her, and she realised that there were <lb/>
obstacles to the successful prosecution of the work <lb/>
in certain districts, which neither individuals nor <lb/>
societies could overcome. All the philanthropic <lb/>
efforts put together&mdash;the Metropolitan Association, <lb/>
the Peabody Trustees, Sir Sydney Waterlow's <reg orig="Com-|pany">Company</reg>, <lb/>
and the Baroness Burdett-Coutts, had only <lb/>
succeeded in housing twenty-six thousand people&mdash; <lb/>
not a great deal more than half the number yearly <lb/>
added to the population of London. For her <lb/>
own scheme of improving the tenants, and making <lb/>
them fit for improved dwellings by a gradual <reg orig="pro-|cess">process</reg>, <lb/>
she found, in working the plan on a larger <lb/>
scale, the hopeless condition of much of the cottage <lb/>
property with which it would be necessary to deal: <lb/>
courts so inclosed that the light of the sun could not <lb/>
penetrate; nests of fever, which needed not <reg orig="restora-|tion">restoration</reg>, <lb/>
but demolition; desirable houses with defective <lb/>
titles; houses radically and incurably afflicted with <lb/>
ground-damp.</p>
<p>In this difficulty, those most interested in the <lb/>
whole question heard of an Act passed in 1866 for <lb/>
the improvement of Glasgow, where a population <lb/>
of fifty thousand had been crowded into eighty <lb/>
acres. The promoters of that Act had come to the <lb/>
conclusion that light and air were necessary <reg orig="ingredi-|ents">ingredients</reg> <lb/>
in the well-being of a great city, and applied to <lb/>
parliament for power to borrow a million and a <lb/>
quarter; they marked the bad parts on a plan, and <lb/>
obtained powers to pull down, rebuild, or sell, as <lb/>
might be thought best. The result, as all who know <lb/>
<pb n="122" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0135"/>
Glasgow can testify, has been eminently satisfactory. <lb/>
That city has not only got an Improvement Act, but <lb/>
has carried it into effect in such a way as to bring <lb/>
about the most thorough sanitary reform. The same <lb/>
thing may be said as regards Edinburgh, for which <lb/>
an Improvement Act was procured in 1867, during <lb/>
the provostship of Dr William Chambers, the <reg orig="well-|known">well-known</reg> <lb/>
publisher. The result has been that some <lb/>
of the most insalubrious parts of the old town have <lb/>
been intersected by spacious streets, with well-built <lb/>
houses. There has since been a marked decrease in <lb/>
the annual death-rate. The Edinburgh Improvement <lb/>
Scheme was so carried out as to prove a financial <lb/>
success.</p>
<p>A pleasant feature in Miss Hill's relations with <lb/>
her tenants from the poorest part of Southwark was <lb/>
evinced in the entertainment provided for them&mdash; <lb/>
to the number of seven or eight hundred&mdash;in the <lb/>
archbishop's field at Lambeth in August 1887. Tea <lb/>
was served in two large tents on tables well <lb/>
spread and decorated with flowers. There were <lb/>
swings and other amusements for the young people, <lb/>
and music was also provided. The tenants were <lb/>
there with their whole families, and the conduct of <lb/>
all was excellent. Many of these tenants had lived <lb/>
thirty and more years in the same buildings, which <lb/>
are now much more tenantable through Miss Hill's <lb/>
work than in the past. A garden and music-hall <lb/>
were also being provided for them on Miss Hill's <lb/>
property.</p>

<figure id="f21" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0136" rend="block"/>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> career of this lady offers no startling <lb/>
incidents, nor, indeed, much out of the <lb/>
ordinary run of domestic life; but in her <lb/>
story, if we may call it so, there is the charm of <lb/>
truthfulness and simplicity, with revelations of high <lb/>
principle, and a remarkable vigour of character. <lb/>
She had the great advantage also of having come <lb/>
in contact with many of the political and literary <lb/>
characters in the early years of the present century.</p>
<p>Eliza Dawson was the daughter of Mr Dawson, a <lb/>
respectable yeoman at Oxton, near Tadcaster, in <lb/>
Yorkshire, who farmed his own small estate, and <lb/>
was a man remarkable for his taste and intelligence. <lb/>
At her birth, in 1770, Eliza had the great misfortune <lb/>
to lose her mother, and was thrown on the affections <lb/>
of her father and other relations. A few years later, <lb/>
she received the kind attentions of her mother's <lb/>
early friend, Mrs Brudenell, whose history in itself <lb/>
was sufficiently sorrowful. As Miss Hebburn, and <lb/>
an heiress, she had the bad fortune to become <lb/>
acquainted with, and to marry the Rev. Edward <lb/>
Brudenell, who, from being an aide-de-camp in the <lb/>
army, entered the service of the church for the <lb/>
sake of a good living. Profligate and devoid of <lb/>
<pb n="124" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0137"/>
proper principle, he soon rendered his wife miserable, <lb/>
and she felt constrained to leave him; having for <lb/>
subsistence only a small allowance from what was <lb/>
substantially her own property. Sympathising with <lb/>
Mrs Brudenell in her unhappy fate, Mr Dawson <lb/>
let her have a cottage on his estate, and there, <lb/>
as a duty, she devoted herself to the elementary <lb/>
education of Eliza, cultivated her taste for poetry, <lb/>
and excited an interest in historical narratives. <lb/>
Improved under this friendly tuition, she was, at <lb/>
eleven years old, sent to rub off her rusticity, and <lb/>
acquire what are called accomplishments, at a <lb/>
boarding-school at York. Eliza's reminiscences of <lb/>
this school-life are not agreeable. The <reg orig="manage-|ment">management</reg> <lb/>
was a routine of despotism and <reg orig="dissimula-|tion">dissimulation</reg>. <lb/>
Four volumes of the <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi> constituted <lb/>
the entire school library. From the strength of <lb/>
her good principles, Miss Dawson escaped the <lb/>
dangers incidental to this pretentious and wretched <lb/>
establishment.</p>
<p>Returning home, Eliza was, at sixteen years of age, <lb/>
indulged by her father with a trip to the Highlands <lb/>
of Scotland, in the course of which she visited a <lb/>
school friend, Mrs Meliss, in the neighbourhood of <lb/>
Perth. On how small a matter is a young lady's <lb/>
fate hinged! A year afterwards, Mrs Meliss <reg orig="intro-|duced">introduced</reg> <lb/>
to her Mr Archibald Fletcher, a practising <lb/>
Edinburgh lawyer, on his way through Yorkshire <lb/>
to London. Fletcher, a Highlander by birth, was <lb/>
a cadet of an old Argyllshire family, Fletcher of <lb/>
Dunans. At this time, he was forty-three years of <lb/>
age&mdash;rather too advanced in life, one would say, to <lb/>
entertain the notion of marrying a girl of seventeen; <lb/>
<pb n="125" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0138"/>
notions of this kind, however, are not always <lb/>
regulated by age. Mr Fletcher was mightily taken <lb/>
with Miss Dawson's acute intelligence and literary <lb/>
tastes; while she was flattered by his attentions, <lb/>
more particularly by his sending her a gift of a <lb/>
handsome copy of Ossian's poems, and a letter <lb/>
inviting her remarks on the work. Next year, <lb/>
Mr Fletcher again paid a visit to Tadcaster. 'I do <lb/>
remember,' says Eliza, 'that when I received his <lb/>
note from the inn, saying that he would do himself <lb/>
the honour to call and spend the evening with us, <lb/>
I did resort to the toilette to curl my hair with <lb/>
rather more care than usual. I was more struck <lb/>
than ever with the good sense and good taste of his <lb/>
conversation, and much interested in his animated <lb/>
account of the splendid speeches he had heard at <lb/>
Westminster Hall, at the trial of Warren Hastings. <lb/>
My own mind had perhaps made some advance in <lb/>
knowledge and reflection, and I enjoyed this visit <lb/>
more than I had done before.' Matters were now in <lb/>
a fair way for a mutual attachment.</p>
<p>In 1789, Eliza again visited Mrs Meliss, near <lb/>
Perth, and thither Mr Fletcher shortly afterwards <lb/>
proceeded; and then, she says, 'the opportunity <lb/>
of conversing much together confirmed the <reg orig="attach-|ment">attachment</reg> <lb/>
he had entertained for me from our first <lb/>
acquaintance in 1787, and converted the sentiments <lb/>
of respect and high esteem I had felt for him into <lb/>
those of a tenderer nature. I thought I had never <lb/>
met with a person of such real elevation of mind, <lb/>
and such independence and worth of character; and <lb/>
a happy union of thirty-seven years as his wife <lb/>
served to confirm me in that opinion. It was agreed <lb/>
<pb n="126" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0139"/>
that he should come to Harrogate in the autumn of <lb/>
that year, and thence to pay us a visit, when he <lb/>
had my permission to make his wishes known to <lb/>
my father.' Proposals were accordingly made, but <lb/>
rejected. The father 'had formed splendid <reg orig="expecta-|tions">expectations</reg> <lb/>
for the child on whom he doted. He could <lb/>
not think of parting with me to such a distance. <lb/>
He could not think of my marrying a man <reg orig="alto-|gether">altogether</reg> <lb/>
without fortune, and where there was so <lb/>
great a disparity of years.' Eliza considered the <lb/>
objections to be sound and rational, yet she did <lb/>
not give up Fletcher, corresponded with him, and <lb/>
hoped still to be his wife. It was clear the marriage <lb/>
could not be indefinitely postponed. It took place on <lb/>
the 16th July 1791; the father offering no further <lb/>
obstacle, yet not giving his consent, nor honouring <lb/>
the ceremony with his presence.</p>
<p>Removing to Edinburgh, a new life opens on <lb/>
Eliza, now Mrs Fletcher. She is introduced to <lb/>
men of talent and literature, and to many women <lb/>
of rank and fashion. Soon, however, she discovered <lb/>
that her husband was somewhat looked down upon <lb/>
on account of his political principles, and that she <lb/>
came in for a share of the obloquy. Archibald <lb/>
Fletcher, to whose nobleness of character Brougham <lb/>
and Cockburn have referred, had been an ardent <lb/>
admirer of the first principles of the French <reg orig="Revolu-|tion">Revolution</reg>. <lb/>
Like many others, he imagined that there was <lb/>
about to dawn an era of civil liberty and social <lb/>
perfectibility. The horrors of the Reign of Terror <lb/>
disenchanted general expectations of this nature, but <lb/>
there were lingering hopes that matters would <lb/>
speedily rectify. Mrs Fletcher, with political <reg orig="lean-|ings">leanings</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="127" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0140"/>
similar to those of her husband, speaks of the <lb/>
prodigious advantage likely to ensue from the <lb/>
breaking up of large properties and the compulsory <lb/>
division of heritage among children in France. <lb/>
Owing to these opinions the Fletchers were kept <lb/>
at a distance by many who would otherwise have <lb/>
befriended them; in point of fact, Archibald Fletcher's <lb/>
professional prospects were injured, though he <reg orig="con-|tinued">continued</reg> <lb/>
to be generally esteemed for his upright <lb/>
conduct.</p>
<p>It was a great happiness to Mrs Fletcher to be <lb/>
visited by her father in 1792, and her happiness <lb/>
was increased the same year by the birth of her <lb/>
eldest son, Miles Angus Fletcher. This was the <lb/>
beginning of a flow of pleasant circumstances. 'In <lb/>
the spring of 1794, my father made us a present <lb/>
of an excellent house in Queen Street, No. 20, and <lb/>
came down himself in the summer with my aunt <lb/>
and Mrs Brudenell to spend a month or two with <lb/>
us. His little grandson, Miles, was now able to <lb/>
talk to him, and such was his delight in looking <lb/>
on this child, that I could not find in my heart <lb/>
to refuse his request to take him along with them <lb/>
when they left us.&hellip; My father saw me <reg orig="sur-|rounded">surrounded</reg> <lb/>
with many blessings.&hellip; He saw that I <lb/>
had confided my happiness to one most deserving.' <lb/>
We pass over notices of the births of several other <lb/>
children, and also the distress caused by the death <lb/>
of Mr Dawson in 1798. Family prospects, however, <lb/>
begin to look up. A cottage at Morningside is <lb/>
taken for summer quarters. Here Mrs Fletcher <lb/>
is visited by an old friend, Mrs Millar, who had <lb/>
gone to America with her husband to escape <lb/>
<pb n="128" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0141"/>
political turmoil. The cure proved worse than the <lb/>
disease. Millar died, and his wife returned to <lb/>
Scotland with all her prospects clouded. 'She <lb/>
interested us much by her animated and graphic <lb/>
descriptions of America, and of men and manners <lb/>
in the United States. She had often seen and <lb/>
conversed with the greatest man of his age&mdash; <lb/>
General Washington&mdash;Philadelphia being then the <lb/>
seat of the Federal government. She described <lb/>
his demeanour as calm, mild, and dignified, and <lb/>
his domestic character as excellent.'</p>
<p>In the spring of 1801, Mrs Fletcher accompanied <lb/>
her husband to London, her first visit to the metropolis. <lb/>
Here she becomes acquainted with Mrs Barbauld and <lb/>
the gifted Joanna Baillie at Hampstead. Speaking of <lb/>
Joanna, she says: 'I found her on a Sunday morning <lb/>
reading the Bible to her mother, a very aged lady, <lb/>
who was quite blind. Joanna's manners and accent <lb/>
were very Scottish, very kind, simple, and unaffected, <lb/>
but less frank than those of her elder sister. She <lb/>
seemed almost studiously to avoid literary <reg orig="conversa-|tion">conversation</reg>, <lb/>
but spoke with much interest of old Scotch <lb/>
friends and of her early days in Scotland. I was <lb/>
much interested in her, having but a short time <lb/>
before read her <hi rend="italic">Plays on the Passions</hi> with deep <lb/>
interest.&hellip; With the brilliancy and power of Mrs <lb/>
Barbauld's conversational talents my husband and I <lb/>
were greatly delighted. She took the same views <lb/>
that we did on public affairs, and had felt deeply, <lb/>
as we had done, disappointment in the disastrous <lb/>
turn of the French Revolution.&hellip; Mr Fletcher <lb/>
had at this time some interviews with his political <lb/>
friend, Mr Sheridan, whom, however, I did not see.'</p>
<pb n="129" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0142"/>
<p>Back to Edinburgh to look after her children, <lb/>
and to send her oldest boy to the High School, <lb/>
Mrs Fletcher touches a point in literary history. <lb/>
'The latter part of the year 1802 was interesting <lb/>
to us in a public way by the commencement of the <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review.</hi> We were fortunate enough to <lb/>
be acquainted more or less intimately with several <lb/>
of the earliest contributors&mdash;Brougham, Mr Jeffrey, <lb/>
Dr John Thomson, Mr John Allen, Francis Horner, <lb/>
and James Grahame, the author of <hi rend="italic">The Sabbath.</hi> <lb/>
James Grahame was a much valued friend. He <lb/>
united to a highly refined and cultivated taste <lb/>
much general information, a very sincere and <lb/>
elevated piety, and the greatest simplicity of <lb/>
manners. I, who knew Edinburgh both before <lb/>
and after the appearance of the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi>, <lb/>
can bear witness to the electrical effects of its <lb/>
publication on the public mind, and to the large <lb/>
and good results, in a political sense, that followed <lb/>
the circulation. The authorship of the different <lb/>
articles was discussed at every dinner-table; and <lb/>
I recollect a table-talk occurrence at our house <lb/>
which must have belonged to this year. Mr <lb/>
Fletcher, though not himself given to scientific <lb/>
inquiry or interests, had been so much struck with <lb/>
the logical and general ability displayed in an <lb/>
article of the young <hi rend="italic">Review</hi> on Professor Black's <lb/>
Chemistry, that, in the midst of a few guests, of <lb/>
whom Henry Brougham was one, he expressed an <lb/>
opinion &lpar;while in ignorance as to the authorship&rpar; <lb/>
to the effect that the man who wrote <hi rend="italic">that</hi> article <lb/>
might do or be anything he pleased. Mr Brougham, <lb/>
who was seated near me at table, stretched eagerly <lb/>
<pb n="130" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0143"/>
forward and said: "What, Mr Fletcher, be <reg orig="any-|thing">anything</reg>? <lb/>
May he be Lord Chancellor?" On which <lb/>
my husband repeated his words with emphasis: <lb/>
"Yes, Lord Chancellor, or anything he desires." <lb/>
This opinion seems to confirm Lord Cockburn's <lb/>
words concerning young Henry Brougham of the <lb/>
Speculative Society, that he even then "scented <lb/>
his quarry from afar."'</p>
<p>Mrs Fletcher tells a somewhat droll anecdote <lb/>
of the gentle James Grahame, the poet of <hi rend="italic">The <lb/>
Sabbath.</hi> 'He was so susceptible of the tender <lb/>
passion that he fell in love at first sight with a <lb/>
young lady whom he saw first ringing at our door, <lb/>
then No. 20 Queen Street. He came in a little <lb/>
afterwards, and asked me many questions about the <lb/>
dark-eyed beauty, who, he said, had thrown the <lb/>
"glamour ower him." I invited him to meet her; <lb/>
she completed her conquest, and at the end of two <lb/>
months they were married.' About this time she <lb/>
began a friendly intimacy with Thomas Campbell, <lb/>
author of the <hi rend="italic">Pleasures of Hope,</hi> adding: 'Life at <lb/>
this time glided on with us calmly and <reg orig="satis-|factorily">satisfactorily</reg>. <lb/>
My husband's professional emoluments, <lb/>
though very moderate, were amply sufficient for <lb/>
us, combined with my inheritance from my father's <lb/>
property, which was left to me in liferent, and was <lb/>
entailed on our children. We had no vanity to <lb/>
lead us into expense: our circle of acquaintance <lb/>
was very limited, consisting chiefly of old <reg orig="profes-|sional">professional</reg> <lb/>
friends of Mr Fletcher, their wives, and <lb/>
families&mdash;with occasional <hi rend="italic">gleams</hi> of more literary <lb/>
and distinguished persons. Of these, was the <lb/>
Hon. Henry Erskine, whose wit, and whose graces <lb/>
<pb n="131" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0144"/>
of mind and manners, placed him at the head of good <lb/>
society in Edinburgh.' Her course of domestic life <lb/>
is thus described, and we may take it as that of a <lb/>
model wife and mother: 'I do not remember to <lb/>
have had any stirrings of worldly vanity or ambition. <lb/>
My delight in feeling that my sympathy in my <lb/>
husband's public feelings contributed much to his <lb/>
happiness, and my just pride in the lofty integrity of <lb/>
his character, and the affectionate kindness of his <lb/>
heart towards me and our children, formed my <lb/>
happiness. These children, too, were my "mirth and <lb/>
matter;" I was wrapped up in them; and though I <lb/>
never could command the patience that qualified me <lb/>
to be their teacher, I delighted in making them my <lb/>
happy and confidential companions.'</p>
<p>In 1804, Mrs Brudenell, by the death of her <lb/>
husband, 'became possessed of her hereditary estate <lb/>
of Hebburn, in Northumberland; and at her earnest <lb/>
desire, Mr Fletcher and I accompanied her to take <lb/>
possession of it. I think one of the most melancholy <lb/>
days of my life was that on which I accompanied this <lb/>
once gay and light-hearted woman to the hills and <lb/>
ruined castle of her ancestors. She who in youth <lb/>
had bounded over those fields the heiress of a fair <lb/>
domain, full of life, hope, and promise, now, at the <lb/>
age of sixty-six, came back a shattered, feeble old <lb/>
woman&mdash;without strength or spirits to enjoy the <lb/>
goods of fortune. She felt this incapacity of <reg orig="enjoy-|ment">enjoyment</reg> <lb/>
with an intensity proportioned to the exquisite <lb/>
pleasure she would have had in being able to exercise <lb/>
hospitality, and to spread cheerfulness around her.' <lb/>
Such is the touching account of a life wrecked by an <lb/>
unfortunate marriage.</p>
<pb n="132" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0145"/>
<p>For the summer of 1810, the Fletchers occupied <lb/>
the pleasant country-house of Frankfield, about a <lb/>
mile above Lasswade. Here they met some <reg orig="interest-|ing">interesting</reg> <lb/>
strangers. One evening, after Mrs Fletcher <lb/>
and her daughters had been weeping over the last <lb/>
chapter of <hi rend="italic">Clarissa Harlowe,</hi> and could think and <lb/>
speak of nothing else, she says: 'We were <reg orig="saunter-|ing">sauntering</reg> <lb/>
about on a bank above the Esk, called the <lb/>
Whinny, when whom should we meet but Professor <lb/>
Playfair; his then pupil, Lord John Russell; Mrs <lb/>
Apreece, afterwards Lady Davy; and Miss Hannah <lb/>
Mackenzie &lpar;a daughter of the "Man of Feeling," <lb/>
Henry Mackenzie&rpar;. This very agreeable party <lb/>
returned to Frankfield with us to drink tea, helping <lb/>
us to forget the creations of Richardson's genius in <lb/>
the sparkling vivacity of Mrs Apreece, and the taste <lb/>
and refinement of her companions.'</p>
<p>Mrs Fletcher remarks that, about 1812, a change <lb/>
for the better came over the social meetings in <lb/>
Edinburgh. 'Large dinner-parties were less <reg orig="fre-|quent">frequent</reg>, <lb/>
and supper-parties&mdash;I mean hot suppers&mdash; <lb/>
were generally discarded. In their place came <lb/>
large evening-parties, where card-playing generally <lb/>
gave place to music or conversation. The company <lb/>
met at nine, and parted at twelve o'clock. Tea <lb/>
and coffee were handed about at nine, and the guests <lb/>
sat down to some light cold refreshments later on <lb/>
in the evening; people did not in these parties <lb/>
meet to eat, but to talk and listen. There you <lb/>
would see a group &lpar;chiefly of ladies&rpar; listening to <lb/>
the brilliant talk of Mr Jeffrey; in a different <lb/>
part of the room, perhaps, another circle, amongst <lb/>
whom were pale-faced, reverential-looking students, <lb/>
<pb n="133" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0146"/>
lending their ears to the playful imaginative <reg orig="dis-|cussions">discussions</reg> <lb/>
of Dr Brown, while Professor Playfair <lb/>
would sometimes throw in an ingenious or quiet <lb/>
remark, that gave fresh animation to the discourse. <lb/>
On other occasions, old Mr Mackenzie would enliven <lb/>
the conversation with anecdotes of men and <reg orig="man-|ners">manners</reg> <lb/>
gone by.' We may contrast this rational and <lb/>
inexpensive method of spending the evenings with <lb/>
ceremonious, heavy, and costly dinners, lasting from <lb/>
seven till ten o'clock, often devoid of any general <lb/>
intellectual converse.</p>
<p>Years pass on, and we are feelingly told by Mrs <lb/>
Fletcher of family bereavements, the first loss being <lb/>
that of Grace, the eldest daughter; the second, that <lb/>
of her husband, in 1828; and the next, that of <lb/>
Miles, her eldest son, in 1831. Mrs Fletcher's life <lb/>
was drawn out beyond the span of ordinary <reg orig="exist-|ence">existence</reg>, <lb/>
and though enduring some sorrows, she had <lb/>
the pleasure of enjoying many blessings, not the <lb/>
least of these being the advancement in life and <lb/>
happiness of her grandchildren. She died from <lb/>
exhaustion of nature, without any bodily pain, <lb/>
and in a gentle sleep, on the morning of the 5th <lb/>
February 1858, having then entered on her <reg orig="eighty-|ninth">eighty-ninth</reg> <lb/>
year.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Elizabeth Gurney</hi>, afterwards Mrs Fry, <lb/>
born on the 21st of May 1780, was the third <lb/>
daughter of John Gurney, of Earlham in <lb/>
Norfolk, a wealthy banker, and a member of the <lb/>
Society of Friends. She lost her maternal parent, a <lb/>
woman of great worth and ability, when only twelve <lb/>
years of age. The family then consisted of eleven <lb/>
children, the eldest of whom was only seventeen. <lb/>
Her feelings of benevolence towards her suffering <lb/>
fellow-creatures appear to have been drawn out in <lb/>
very early childhood, by her being the companion of <lb/>
her mother in her visits to the cottages of their poor <lb/>
neighbours. In other respects there was nothing <lb/>
striking in her character excepting strong affection, <lb/>
which was particularly called forth towards her <lb/>
parents, and brothers and sisters. When about <lb/>
seventeen, she was seriously impressed with the <lb/>
importance of religion, and both her judgment and <lb/>
conscience subsequently decided in favour of the <lb/>
society to which her family belonged, and of which <lb/>
she afterwards became such an ornament.</p>
<p>She was now enabled to gratify her feelings of <lb/>
benevolence by becoming her father's almoner, and <lb/>
she was never sparing of her own personal <reg orig="sacri-|fices">sacrifices</reg>, <lb/>
both of time and property, for the benefit of <lb/>
others. Her own education was rather deficient, <lb/>

<pb n="137" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0150"/>
owing to some want of application in herself, and <lb/>
partly from her general delicate state of health; yet <lb/>
even at this early period of her life she felt the <lb/>
necessity of giving instruction to the humbler classes, <lb/>
as a means of improving their moral condition. To <lb/>
carry out this idea, she taught the poor children in <lb/>
the neighbourhood; and in a short time her school, <lb/>
which was commenced with one little boy, increased <lb/>
to above seventy scholars, and was then held in a <lb/>
vacant laundry attached to their house. The first <lb/>
mention we have of her sympathies being drawn out <lb/>
by the moral degradation of her species, was while <lb/>
on a tour through part of Wales and the south of <lb/>
England, in company with her father and six sisters. <lb/>
When at Plymouth &lpar;1798&rpar;, they visited the <reg orig="dock-|yards">dockyards</reg>; <lb/>
and she notes in her diary: 'My mind felt <lb/>
deeply hurt on account of the poor sailors and <lb/>
women, of whom I have seen a sad number, and <lb/>
longed to do them good, to try one day to make them <lb/>
sensible of the evil state they appear to be in.'</p>
<p>On the 19th of August 1800, Elizabeth Gurney <lb/>
was united to Mr Joseph Fry, who was then a junior <lb/>
partner in a large mercantile establishment, and she <lb/>
and her husband took up their abode in St Mildred's <lb/>
Court. During their residence in this place, their <lb/>
five eldest children were born; and notwithstanding <lb/>
the duties of her family, and the delicate state of <lb/>
her own health, she devoted much time to visiting <lb/>
the abodes of want and misery. Her removal to <lb/>
Plashet House, Essex, in 1809, was not only more <lb/>
congenial to her feelings, by gratifying her natural <lb/>
love of the country, but opened fresh fields for her <lb/>
benevolence. The change was occasioned by the <lb/>
<pb n="138" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0151"/>
death of her husband's father, whose country seat it <lb/>
had previously been. She established a school in <lb/>
the neighbourhood, and was looked up to by the <lb/>
poor around as the Lady Bountiful of the place. <lb/>
Even the gipsies, who, about the time of Fairlop <lb/>
Fair, were in the habit of pitching their tents near <lb/>
her house, came under her kind notice; and the <lb/>
pariahs of society heard themselves&mdash;many perhaps <lb/>
for the first time&mdash;addressed by fair and gentle lips <lb/>
in terms of sisterly sympathy.</p>
<p>But we must now follow her to the principal <lb/>
sphere of her philanthropy&mdash;the loathsome and <lb/>
neglected cells of the prison; where her sweet voice <lb/>
was heard whispering to the most abandoned of her <lb/>
sex of a return to virtue and happiness. In 1813 <lb/>
several members of the Society of Friends visited <lb/>
Newgate, to see some felons under sentence of death. <lb/>
These gentlemen were on terms of intimacy with <lb/>
Mrs Fry, and they gave her such a sad account of <lb/>
the state of the women confined there, that she, <lb/>
accompanied by a female friend, Anna Buxton, <lb/>
entered this abode of misery and crime, for the <lb/>
purpose of affording warm clothing to the wretched <lb/>
inmates. Owing to ill-health and domestic trials, <lb/>
she did not renew her visits for three or four years; <lb/>
but during that time she was learning in the school <lb/>
of affliction to sympathise even more truly with the <lb/>
sufferings of others. Her next efforts were made in <lb/>
1817, when she formed a school for the children of <lb/>
the prisoners and the young criminals. In a letter <lb/>
to her eldest sister, she expresses the interest she <lb/>
took in the cause of these poor outcasts&mdash;'My heart, <lb/>
and mind, and time,' she says, 'are very much <lb/>
<pb n="139" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0152"/>
engaged in various ways. Newgate is a principal <lb/>
object; and I think, until I make some attempt at <lb/>
amendment in the plans for the women, I shall not <lb/>
feel easy; but if such efforts should prove <reg orig="unsuccess-|ful">unsuccessful</reg>, <lb/>
I think that I should then have tried to do my <lb/>
part, and be easy.' In the spring of this year an <lb/>
association was consequently formed for the '<reg orig="Im-|provement">Improvement</reg> <lb/>
of the Female Prisoners in Newgate.' <lb/>
The object of this society was to provide clothing, <lb/>
employment, and instruction for the women. They <lb/>
were paid for their work, and received part of the <lb/>
money immediately, that they might procure any <lb/>
little comfort they needed; the rest was placed in <lb/>
the hands of the committee, as a reserve for future <lb/>
use. This plan was found highly beneficial, by <lb/>
occupying the time which had before been spent in <lb/>
gaming, drinking, and quarrelling.</p>
<p>Before these steps were taken, however, the city <lb/>
authorities were consulted. They expressed their <lb/>
approbation of the plans, but looked upon their <lb/>
realisation as hopeless, thinking that the prisoners <lb/>
would never be brought to submit to the restraints <lb/>
which such a change must impose upon them. But <lb/>
Mrs Fry collected the women together; and after <lb/>
having pointed out to them the advantages of <lb/>
industry and sobriety, and the pleasures of conscious <lb/>
rectitude&mdash;at the same time contrasting this picture <lb/>
by their own direful experience of the misery of <lb/>
vice&mdash;she told them that the ladies of the committee <lb/>
had not come to command their obedience, but had <lb/>
left their homes and families to entreat them for <lb/>
their good. She then asked if they were willing to <lb/>
act in concert with them, assuring them that not a <lb/>
<pb n="140" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0153"/>
rule should be made without their entire and united <lb/>
concurrence. Each rule was then put separately to <lb/>
the vote, and such was the effect of gentleness and <lb/>
reason even upon minds so untractable, that they <lb/>
were all unanimously carried.</p>
<p>Hitherto, a scene of riot and confusion had <lb/>
occurred on the occasion of removing the female <lb/>
convicts from Newgate in open wagons. The <lb/>
common sense of Mrs Fry revolted at this indecent <lb/>
exhibition, and she suggested that the removal <lb/>
should take place privately by means of <reg orig="hackney-|coaches">hackneycoaches</reg>. <lb/>
The governors having acceded to the <reg orig="pro-|posal">proposal</reg>, <lb/>
the experiment was tried, and it proved <reg orig="per-|fectly">perfectly</reg> <lb/>
successful. When on board, Mrs Fry and the <lb/>
ladies of her party examined into the <reg orig="accommoda-|tion">accommodation</reg>, <lb/>
and made many wise arrangements for the <lb/>
voyage; among others, materials for work were <reg orig="pro-|vided">provided</reg>, <lb/>
which was to be sold for the benefit of the <lb/>
convicts on reaching the place of their destination. <lb/>
This was of more essential service to them than she <lb/>
was then aware of, for she afterwards learned from <lb/>
the chaplain of the colony at New South Wales that <lb/>
there was at that time no asylum provided for them <lb/>
on their arrival.</p>
<p>In August 1818 Mrs Fry journeyed into the <lb/>
north of England and Scotland, accompanied by her <lb/>
brother, Mr Joseph J. Gurney. They made a close <lb/>
examination into the state of the prisons in their <lb/>
route, and Mr Gurney published an account of these <lb/>
investigations, and laid before the magistrates at <lb/>
the various places a statement of facts, pointing out <lb/>
to them modes of improvement, which were in most <lb/>
instances adopted. Two years, after, Mrs Fry took <lb/>
<pb n="141" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0154"/>
another journey into the north, and in many places <lb/>
was able to form committees of ladies to visit the <lb/>
female prisoners in their own county jails. 'The <lb/>
British Ladies' Society for Promoting the <reg orig="Reforma-|tion">Reformation</reg> <lb/>
of Female Prisoners' was instituted soon after. <lb/>
Its object was to unite these branch societies in one <lb/>
body, that there might be systematic effort in the <lb/>
good work. This association has proved highly <lb/>
beneficial in many ways, by establishing houses of <lb/>
shelter for discharged prisoners who had no homes, <lb/>
and affording relief, part in the shape of a loan, and <lb/>
part as a gift, to such as were willing to earn an <lb/>
honest living by their own exertions; also by <reg orig="found-|ing">founding</reg> <lb/>
schools of discipline for female vagrants and <lb/>
juvenile offenders, &amp;c. In the summer of 1824, in <lb/>
consequence of ill-health, Mrs Fry made a stay of <lb/>
several months at Brighton. While here, she was <lb/>
much interested in the state of the poor around&mdash; <lb/>
both that of the numerous beggars and the resident <lb/>
poor in the neighbourhood. She had, a short time <lb/>
before, consulted with Dr Chalmers on the best <lb/>
method of assisting this class, and was therefore in <lb/>
some measure acquainted with his views: she now <lb/>
directed her attention to the subject, and '<reg orig="District-|Visiting">DistrictVisiting</reg> <lb/>
Societies' were in consequence set on foot, <lb/>
to examine into and relieve real cases of want.</p>
<p>Her illness was attended by frequent attacks of <lb/>
faintness in the early morning, and she was at such <lb/>
times carried to an open window for the influence of <lb/>
the fresh breezes. The coast was visible from her <lb/>
chamber, and as she sat and watched the first gray <lb/>
streaks of dawn over the foaming ocean, or gazed on <lb/>
the dreary cliffs before her, only one living object <lb/>
<pb n="142" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0155"/>
was present to her view. This was the coastguard, <lb/>
who paced with measured step the lonely beach. <lb/>
Her thoughtful and ever-active benevolence <reg orig="sug-|gested">suggested</reg> <lb/>
means of benefiting these men, who were in <lb/>
a great measure shut out from intercourse with their <lb/>
fellow-creatures. One day, when passing near one <lb/>
of the stations, she ordered her coachman to stop, <lb/>
that she might make inquiries into their general <lb/>
condition. The man addressed, however, politely <lb/>
told her that he was not allowed to hold <reg orig="communi-|cation">communication</reg> <lb/>
with any one whilst on duty. Fearing that <lb/>
this short colloquy might therefore bring him into <lb/>
trouble, she gave him her card, telling him to present <lb/>
it to his commanding officer. A few days after, the <lb/>
lieutenant in command called upon her, and offered <lb/>
to answer any inquiries. He informed her that the <lb/>
coastguard were subject to many dangers and <reg orig="pri-|vations">privations</reg>, <lb/>
being exposed to all weathers, as well as to <lb/>
the violence of the smugglers. She at once provided <lb/>
those in the vicinity with Bibles, and afterwards <lb/>
made strenuous efforts to obtain libraries for the use <lb/>
of all the men thus employed. She saw that the <lb/>
loneliness of their situation, and the absence of <lb/>
proper subjects for thought, together with their <lb/>
contact with lawless smugglers, must of necessity <lb/>
produce idle habits and fierce manners; and that, to <lb/>
prevent this moral evil, it was requisite to provide <lb/>
wholesome food for the mind. In consequence of <lb/>
her representations, a committee was formed for this <lb/>
object, and by means of a liberal grant from the <lb/>
government, and various subscriptions, upwards of <lb/>
21,000 persons were supplied with religious and <lb/>
instructive books; 498 libraries were established for <lb/>
<pb n="143" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0156"/>
the stations on shore, containing 25,896 volumes; <lb/>
74 also for districts, comprising 12,880 volumes; <lb/>
48 others for cruisers, composed of 1867 volumes, <lb/>
beside 5357 numbers of pamphlets, and 6464 <reg orig="school-|books">schoolbooks</reg> <lb/>
for the use of the children of the crews; <lb/>
making a total of 52,464 volumes.</p>
<p>In 1835 Mrs Fry accompanied her husband on a <lb/>
journey into the south of England; and, as usual, <lb/>
it furnished objects of interest for that strangely <lb/>
active mind, which found 'sermons in stones, and <lb/>
good in everything.' When passing over Salisbury <lb/>
Plain, she noticed the monotonous life led by the <lb/>
numerous shepherds, and the thought suggested itself <lb/>
that libraries would be equally useful to them as to <lb/>
the coastguards. She therefore stopped a short time <lb/>
at Amesbury, in order to form a library there; and <lb/>
the following letter, which was written a few months <lb/>
after by the person who had the charge of the books, <lb/>
will show the success of the plan: 'Forty-five books <lb/>
are in constant circulation, with the additional <reg orig="maga-|zines">magazines</reg>. <lb/>
More than fifty poor people read them with <lb/>
attention, return them with thanks, and desire the <lb/>
loan of more, frequently observing, they think it a <lb/>
very kind thing indeed that they should be furnished <lb/>
with so many good books, free of all cost, so <reg orig="enter-|taining">entertaining</reg> <lb/>
and instructive these long winter evenings.'</p>
<p>At Falmouth she witnessed the arrival and <reg orig="depart-|ure">departure</reg> <lb/>
of different vessels and packets, and her <reg orig="benevo-|lent">benevolent</reg> <lb/>
heart again pointed out the benefit to be derived <lb/>
from books, especially to those who have much time <lb/>
unemployed. By the co-operation of friends, chiefly <lb/>
the captains of the vessels, and generous grants from <lb/>
different societies, she was enabled to see this <reg orig="defici-|ency">deficiency</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="144" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0157"/>
supplied, each packet being furnished with a <lb/>
box containing thirty volumes, which were changed <lb/>
from time to time. Captain Clavell kindly <reg orig="under-|took">undertook</reg> <lb/>
the charge of this library, and one of his family <lb/>
sent the following account of it to Mrs Fry: 'Our <lb/>
library is getting on with much success: the men <lb/>
appear more anxious than ever to read. I cannot <lb/>
tell you how much we all feel indebted to you for <lb/>
your kindness and benevolent exertions, but <reg orig="particu-|larly">particularly</reg> <lb/>
our poor sailors.' At a later period: 'I have <lb/>
delightful accounts from all the packets: the men <lb/>
really beg for the books. I wish I could show you a <lb/>
box just returned from sea; the books well thumbed, <lb/>
a proof, I should think, of their being read.'</p>
<p>Another object of interest to her was the naval <lb/>
hospitals; and by her influence libraries were <reg orig="intro-|duced">introduced</reg> <lb/>
there likewise. Nor must we omit to mention <lb/>
the reading-room and library she formed, a short <lb/>
time before her death, whilst staying at the little <lb/>
village of Cromer for change of air. This was for <lb/>
the use of the fishermen in the neighbourhood, to <lb/>
draw them from the public-house; and though it <lb/>
was but a small experiment, it was entirely successful, <lb/>
and is full of encouragement and instruction to those <lb/>
who seek, on a larger scale, the deliverance of their <lb/>
fellows from the bonds of vice and idleness.</p>
<p>Mrs Fry had at this time the gratification of <reg orig="receiv-|ing">receiving</reg> <lb/>
numerous letters from officers of the coastguard <lb/>
stations, informing her of the good resulting from <lb/>
her labours in this way. She had also many written <lb/>
expressions of gratitude and affection from the poor <lb/>
prisoners in Newgate, as well as cheering intelligence <lb/>
from New South Wales, several of the convicts having <lb/>
<pb n="145" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0158"/>
sent letters of thanks to her for the instruction she <lb/>
had given to them, and for the kind interest she <lb/>
had taken in their welfare. These things greatly <lb/>
encouraged her in her arduous undertakings, and <lb/>
showed that she had not mistaken her mission, <lb/>
though, in fulfilling it, she was obliged in some <lb/>
instances to step out of the conventional rules of her <lb/>
sex. She had much to endure from the narrow <reg orig="pre-|judices">prejudices</reg> <lb/>
of some, and the illiberal judgment of others. <lb/>
Her noble self-sacrifices were attributed to low <lb/>
motives, and she was even charged with a neglect <lb/>
of her home duties. All this, however, was of little <lb/>
moment, for it could not overturn the obvious and <lb/>
practical results of her labours. If Mrs Fry had <lb/>
preferred the opinion of the world to the divine <lb/>
spirit of philanthropy which impelled her from <lb/>
within, she would have continued to dance and sing <lb/>
at least as long as the sun of life shone.</p>
<p>In 1828 a house of business in which Mr Fry was <lb/>
concerned failed. It was not the one which that <lb/>
gentleman personally conducted in St Mildred's Court, <lb/>
but it occasioned a loss so serious to him, as altogether <lb/>
to change the circumstances of the family. They <lb/>
were now obliged to give up Plashet House, and all <lb/>
the luxuries of affluence, and remove, after a short <lb/>
stay in London, to a comparatively humble dwelling <lb/>
in the vicinity of their late abode. The chief cause <lb/>
of regret to Mrs Fry arose from the fact of her being <lb/>
now unable to render assistance to the poor around, <lb/>
who had so long looked up to her as their friend, and <lb/>
being obliged also to withdraw her support from her <lb/>
school. Much sympathy was expressed in this hour <lb/>
of trial by those who had united with her in her <lb/>
<pb n="146" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0159"/>
labours of love, and many gratifying testimonies of <lb/>
esteem and affection were presented. <reg orig="Notwithstand-|ing">Notwithstanding</reg> <lb/>
the diminished resources of this remarkable <lb/>
woman, she continued to devote her time to the <lb/>
cause so near her heart. In company with one or <lb/>
other of her brothers, she made fresh tours into <lb/>
Scotland and Ireland, and afterwards extended these <lb/>
journeys to several parts of the Continent. Their <lb/>
object was not only to inspect the prisons, but also <lb/>
the lunatic asylums, national schools, and hospitals, <lb/>
which were equally in need of improvement; and a <lb/>
vast amount of good resulted from their labours. <lb/>
Our limits will not allow of our entering into details <lb/>
respecting these journeys; but Mrs Fry and her <lb/>
brothers made personal appeals to the sovereigns of <lb/>
England, France, Holland, Belgium, Denmark, Prussia, <lb/>
Hanover, and others, on behalf of suffering humanity. <lb/>
Nor did they forget the claims of the poor slave, but <lb/>
remonstrated with these exalted individuals on their <lb/>
countenancing the slave-trade in their colonies. They <lb/>
were received with courtesy, and many of their <lb/>
suggestions adopted. None could listen to Mrs Fry's <lb/>
simple eloquence, bold in its truthfulness, yet <reg orig="breath-|ing">breathing</reg> <lb/>
the very soul of love, without being touched by <lb/>
it. The monarch felt that the beauty of sincerity <lb/>
surpassed the homage of the courtier; and the <lb/>
hardened heart of the criminal melted under the <lb/>
gentle influence of her nature, and felt the loveliness <lb/>
of virtue. That she experienced no self-exaltation <lb/>
at the universal respect which was shown to her, is <lb/>
obvious from many passages in her diary. At one <lb/>
time she says: 'I have fears for myself in visiting <lb/>
palaces rather than prisons, and going after the rich <lb/>
<pb n="147" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0160"/>
rather than the poor, lest my eyes should become <lb/>
blinded, or I should fall away in anything from the <lb/>
simple, pure standard of truth and righteousness.'</p>
<p>Fatigue of body and mind had long been <reg orig="weaken-|ing">weakening</reg> <lb/>
her health, and in July 1843 her friends became <lb/>
alarmed. This illness continued, with short intervals <lb/>
of amendment, until October 12, 1845, when her <lb/>
earthly career ended. All that affection could devise <lb/>
was done for her; she was taken from one <reg orig="watering-|place">wateringplace</reg> <lb/>
to another; but nature was exhausted. In her <lb/>
sixty-sixth year she breathed her last at Ramsgate, <lb/>
deeply lamented not only by all who were bound to <lb/>
her by the ties of kindred, but by thousands whom <lb/>
her philanthropy had assisted, and her virtues had <lb/>
attached to her. When estimating the success of <lb/>
her labours, something must be attributed to the <lb/>
general spirit of improvement of the age; yet surely <lb/>
much praise is due to those individuals who nobly <lb/>
pioneer the way. At the time that Mrs Fry entered <lb/>
this field of labour, the prisons were in a lamentable <lb/>
state. Various causes had operated to destroy the <lb/>
good which Howard had laboured to effect, and the <lb/>
acts of parliament which were passed in consequence <lb/>
of his exertions had become a dead letter. The <lb/>
ground had therefore, as it were, to be trodden <lb/>
afresh, and for this work Mrs Fry was eminently <lb/>
qualified. Her warm, loving heart embraced the <lb/>
whole human family; but her chief object was to <lb/>
stretch forth the hand of encouragement to those of <lb/>
her own sex who were sunk in vice and misery, and <lb/>
to lead them to virtue and happiness. After her <lb/>
death, two of her daughters prepared <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of the <lb/>

<p>HANNAH MORE <lb/>
was born at <reg orig="Staple-|ton">Stapleton</reg>, <lb/>
in <reg orig="Gloucester-|shire">Gloucestershire</reg>, <lb/>
in the year <lb/>
1745. She was the <lb/>
youngest but one of <lb/>
five daughters, and <lb/>
her parents ranked <lb/>
among the poorer <lb/>
classes of society, <lb/>
though respected <lb/>
by all who knew <lb/>
them. Her father <lb/>
held the humble <lb/>
but honourable <lb/>
office of village <lb/>
schoolmaster; and such was his reputation for sobriety <lb/>
and diligence, that, on a vacancy in the parochial <lb/>
school of St Mary Redcliffe, at Bristol, he was <lb/>
appointed to that situation without competition. <lb/>
Hannah, who was at this time about fourteen years <lb/>
old, had even at that age attracted notice by the <reg orig="fer-|tility">fertility</reg> <lb/>
of her genius and aptitude for learning. The <lb/>
propriety of her conduct, as evinced in the assistance <lb/>

<pb n="151" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0164"/>
which she rendered to her parents, and particularly in <lb/>
the instruction she imparted to her sisters, did not fail <lb/>
to procure her some valuable friends; through the <lb/>
patronage of one of whom, Dr Stonehouse, as well as <lb/>
of his family, she was enabled to establish a <reg orig="respect-|able">respectable</reg> <lb/>
and flourishing day-school on Redcliffe Hill. <lb/>
Through the same interest, she afterwards removed <lb/>
to Park Street in Bristol; and here she and her <lb/>
sisters took a select number of boarders, so that at <lb/>
length the day-school was given up. Hannah had <lb/>
now leisure to store her mind with polite learning&mdash;a <lb/>
measure desirable in her situation, more especially <lb/>
since her previous education had been of the plainest <lb/>
description. So well did she now profit by her <lb/>
studies, and the refined society with which she was <lb/>
surrounded, that at the age of eighteen she was <lb/>
endowed with sufficient ability to compose some <lb/>
poetical pieces for the improvement of her pupils, <lb/>
one or two of whom were actually older than herself. <lb/>
Among those early productions was a pastoral drama, <lb/>
entitled, <hi rend="italic">The Search after Happiness,</hi> which was <lb/>
recited by a party of young ladies, for whom it was <lb/>
purposely written, and which was eagerly read and <lb/>
much admired by several persons of literary taste <lb/>
and judgment at Bristol. As manuscript copies <lb/>
were in consequence handed about and multiplied <lb/>
among the author's friends, the publication of the <lb/>
pastoral was strongly desired, but all importunities <lb/>
to that effect were resisted, till Garrick, the <reg orig="cele-|brated">celebrated</reg> <lb/>
actor, added his recommendation, when the <lb/>
drama was printed at Bristol; and such was its <lb/>
success, that within a few months it passed through <lb/>
three editions.</p>
<pb n="152" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0165"/>
<p>A successful first piece usually confirms the young <lb/>
mind in authorcraft. Hannah now felt encouraged <lb/>
to try her ability in the highest branch of dramatic <lb/>
poetry. She brought out, one after another, three <lb/>
pieces in the line of tragedy, which were received <lb/>
with a flattering measure of applause; but these, <lb/>
with some subsequent legendary poems, did not gain <lb/>
permanent popularity. Nevertheless, their success <lb/>
at the time induced the young authoress to proceed <lb/>
in her literary occupation. In 1777 she published a <lb/>
small volume of <hi rend="italic">Essays for Young Ladies,</hi> which <lb/>
was also received with approbation; and in 1782 <lb/>
she put forth a volume of <hi rend="italic">Sacred Dramas,</hi> with a <lb/>
poem annexed, entitled 'Sensibility.' This attempt <lb/>
to dramatise some of the historical portions of the <lb/>
Bible was equally successful. The talents of the <lb/>
writer, and the high moral strain of her sentiment, <lb/>
gave satisfaction to all who consider the cultivation <lb/>
of the young as of paramount importance, for to that <lb/>
end nearly all Hannah More's efforts tended. Among <lb/>
others by whom she was thus esteemed was Dr <lb/>
Samuel Johnson; and it need hardly be said that <lb/>
Hannah had a due sense of the value of his <reg orig="friend-|ship">friendship</reg>. <lb/>
She admired Johnson's stern inflexibility of <lb/>
moral character, she venerated his principles; and it <lb/>
is apparent that the style of the one was adopted as <lb/>
the model of the other.</p>
<p>Betwixt 1786 and 1789 our authoress published <lb/>
different poems of more or less merit; and, on the <lb/>
outbreak of the French Revolution, she endeavoured, <lb/>
by some prose writings, now generally forgotten, <lb/>
from their temporary character, to stem the tide of <lb/>
immorality which was considered to be setting in <lb/>
<pb n="153" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0166"/>
over Britain. Of some of these publications, such <lb/>
as the <hi rend="italic">Shepherd of Salisbury Plain,</hi> not fewer than <lb/>
a million of copies were sold. In the country <lb/>
around Bristol, she likewise did much to promote <lb/>
the establishment of societies and schools, calculated <lb/>
to be beneficial to the poor and unlearned, which <lb/>
afterwards proved of great benefit, not only to the <lb/>
district, but in other quarters where they were <lb/>
laudably imitated. In 1799 Hannah More published <lb/>
her <hi rend="italic">Strictures on the Modern System of Female <lb/>
Education,</hi> three editions of which appeared the same <lb/>
year. Her strictures and precepts on this subject <lb/>
were by many considered as too severe, and in some <lb/>
measure unjust; they however met with the <reg orig="appro-|bation">approbation</reg> <lb/>
of the highest personages in the realm, by <lb/>
whom she was desired to frame them for the <reg orig="instruct-|tion">instructtion</reg> <lb/>
of the Princess Charlotte. At this time she <lb/>
had retired from active life; but this flattering <lb/>
commission induced her to relinquish her house at <lb/>
Bath, and to return to Barley Wood, a cottage <lb/>
delightfully situated in the village of Wrington, <lb/>
there to pursue her work. Here she wrote the <lb/>
treatise entitled <hi rend="italic">Hints towards Forming the <reg orig="Char-|acter">Character</reg> <lb/>
of a Young Princess,</hi> which, on being published, <lb/>
was extensively read and admired among persons <lb/>
whose judgment was deserving of esteem.</p>
<p>In 1809 there appeared a tale, in two volumes, <lb/>
entitled <hi rend="italic">C&oelig;lebs in Search of a Wife.</hi> Though the <lb/>
work was unaccredited by any name, the world <lb/>
immediately ascribed it to Hannah More; and such <lb/>
was the effect of the impression, that six editions <lb/>
were sold in the course of the year. This was the <lb/>
first attempt of our authoress at novel-writing; and <lb/>
<pb n="154" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0167"/>
she was led to adopt that mode of conveying <reg orig="instruct-|tion">instructtion</reg> <lb/>
now, for a moral and religious purpose. The <lb/>
object of the work is to exhibit the dispositions, <lb/>
manners, attainments, and principles necessary to <lb/>
insure domestic happiness. The author, imagining, <lb/>
and probably knowing from experience, that those <lb/>
who stand most in need of instruction on this subject <lb/>
would not have patience to read grave disquisitions <lb/>
and didactic essays, contrived to weave her lessons <lb/>
into the form of a pleasing story, with a title <reg orig="calcu-|lated">calculated</reg> <lb/>
to attract general attention. <hi rend="italic">C&oelig;lebs</hi> was soon <lb/>
translated into foreign languages, and this successful <lb/>
fiction produced a host of imitations in the religious <lb/>
novel style, not one of which possessed the genius <lb/>
of the original.</p>
<p>In 1811, and the following year, she favoured <lb/>
the world with two very valuable treatises, closely <lb/>
connected with each other in subject&mdash;the first <lb/>
entitled <hi rend="italic">Practical Piety, or the Influence of the <lb/>
Religion of the Heart on the Conduct of Life;</hi> the <lb/>
second, <hi rend="italic">Christian Morals.</hi> In the prefaces of these <lb/>
works, affecting allusions are made to the situation <lb/>
under which they were written, and more especially <lb/>
to the deaths, in almost quick succession, of three <lb/>
of her sisters&mdash;Mary, Elizabeth, and Sarah the eldest <lb/>
survivor. The preface to the <hi rend="italic">Christian Morals</hi> <lb/>
was intended as a literary farewell to the public, in <lb/>
a grateful acknowledgment for a long continuance of <lb/>
patronage, and an apology for another appearance <lb/>
in the world as an instructor. But though, <reg orig="appar-|ently">apparently</reg>, <lb/>
Mrs More now took a final leave of the press, <lb/>
which she had for so many years employed <reg orig="honour-|ably">honourably</reg> <lb/>
to herself and beneficially to the world, her <lb/>
<pb n="155" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0168"/>
entire mind still laboured with delight in the cause <lb/>
to which her talents had been uniformly devoted. <lb/>
In 1815 she published one of the ablest of her <lb/>
performances, <hi rend="italic">An Essay on the Character and <lb/>
Writings of St Paul;</hi> and in the few subsequent <lb/>
years she wrote a series of moral portraits, drawn <lb/>
from real life, entitled <hi rend="italic">Modern Sketches.</hi> Most of <lb/>
these appeared from time to time in the <hi rend="italic">Christian <lb/>
Observer;</hi> together with others, which the writer <lb/>
afterwards transferred, in a more lively form, to the <lb/>
pages of <hi rend="italic">C&oelig;lebs.</hi></p>
<p>With these papers the literary history of Mrs <lb/>
Hannah More terminated. She had previously <lb/>
retired from Barley Wood to a neat house in <lb/>
Clifton, where, for the remainder of her days, in <lb/>
a state of decrepitude from repeated attacks of <lb/>
rheumatism, and a complication of other disorders, <lb/>
she lived in a state of peaceful quietude, <reg orig="appro-|priate">appropriate</reg> <lb/>
to her pious sentiments, till the 7th of <lb/>
September 1833, when she died at the age of <lb/>
eighty-eight years. Both by her boarding-school <lb/>
and her literary efforts, she had realised an ample <lb/>
fortune&mdash;it is understood not less than &pound;30,000, of <lb/>
which she bequeathed &pound;10,000, in sums of different <lb/>
amount, to various societies, schools, hospitals, and <lb/>
other charitable and religious institutions.</p>
<p>Although her books have almost disappeared from <lb/>
public notice, Hannah More yet deserves <reg orig="remem-|brance">remembrance</reg> <lb/>
for her philanthropic labours, the high moral <lb/>
tone of these books, and the good influence they <lb/>
exerted in the society of her day.</p>

<head><hi rend="bold">LADY GRISELL BAILLIE.</hi></head>
<figure id="f28" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0169" rend="block"/>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Among</hi> that small band of faithful contenders <lb/>
for civil and religious liberty in the reign <lb/>
of Charles II., there were two Scotsmen, <lb/>
Sir Patrick Hume of Polwarth, afterwards Earl of <lb/>
Marchmont, and Robert Baillie of Jerviswood, who <lb/>
were quite as memorable as those eminent sufferers <lb/>
in the same cause, Lord Russell and Algernon Sidney. <lb/>
Polwarth is a small parish near the centre of <lb/>
Berwickshire, deriving some note from its village, <lb/>
ordinarily known as Polwarth-on-the-green&mdash;the <lb/>
village being a scattered collection of dwellings on a <lb/>
green or common, in the centre of which once grew <lb/>
a thorn-tree, celebrated in song and local tradition. <lb/>
Sir Patrick Hume succeeded his father as laird of <lb/>
the estate of Polwarth in 1648, while still a mere <lb/>
child, and was indebted to his excellent mother, a <lb/>
pious lady, for the better part of his early education. <lb/>
The dwelling-place of the family was Redbraes Castle, <lb/>
about two miles from the parish church of Polwarth. <lb/>
In due time, Sir Patrick was married, and had a <lb/>
large family&mdash;as many as eighteen children, the <lb/>
eldest of whom was a daughter, Grisell, born on <lb/>
Christmas-day, 1665.</p>
<p>It need scarcely be told that at this time <reg orig="Scot-|land">Scotland</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="157" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0170"/>
was in a ferment on account of certain severe <lb/>
measures adopted by the ruling authorities against <lb/>
nonconformists, who declined to take the 'test,' and <lb/>
murmured at the arbitrary orders of the court and <lb/>
privy-council. In 1673, when Sir Patrick sat as a <lb/>
member of the Scottish parliament, he was bold <lb/>
enough to oppose the despotic propositions of <reg orig="Lauder-|dale">Lauderdale</reg>, <lb/>
and was henceforth denounced as a person <lb/>
dangerous to the state. Two years later, having <lb/>
remonstrated against the measure for establishing <lb/>
garrisons to keep down the people, he was committed <lb/>
to the Tolbooth of Edinburgh, and subsequently sent <lb/>
to Stirling Castle, in which he suffered six months' <lb/>
imprisonment. He was liberated by the intercession <lb/>
of friends, but not long afterwards was again <reg orig="con-|fined">confined</reg>, <lb/>
and altogether suffered imprisonment for about <lb/>
two years. Finding that the Scottish ministers of <lb/>
state were bent on his destruction, he went for a <lb/>
time to England, and had some friendly intercourse <lb/>
with the Earl of Shaftesbury and Lord Russell.</p>
<p>Returning to his home at Redbraes, Sir Patrick <lb/>
hoped to escape notice, but things were now worse <lb/>
than ever. The persecution of the Covenanters was <lb/>
at its height. On the 22d of June 1679, was fought <lb/>
the battle of Bothwell Brig, at which the insurgents <lb/>
suffered severe loss; twelve hundred of them being <lb/>
taken prisoners, were driven to Edinburgh, and <reg orig="con-|fined">confined</reg> <lb/>
in a pen like cattle, till their numbers were <lb/>
thinned by public execution or banishment. <reg orig="Claver-|house">Claverhouse</reg> <lb/>
traversed the disturbed parts of the country <lb/>
with a troop of dragoons, trying people by military <lb/>
law, and slaying without mercy, or, at the least, <lb/>
capturing persons of note, and sending them to <lb/>
<pb n="158" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0171"/>
Edinburgh for trial by the justiciary court and <lb/>
privy-council. We only glance at a state of things <lb/>
which brought disgrace on the Stewart dynasty, and <lb/>
helped materially towards its expulsion. Perhaps <lb/>
Charles II. was not to blame personally for the <reg orig="in-|humanities">inhumanities</reg> <lb/>
inflicted in his name; but, by his <reg orig="indiffer-|ence">indifference</reg> <lb/>
or weakness, his Scottish ministers&mdash;a set of <lb/>
despicable time-servers&mdash;were allowed to do pretty <lb/>
much as they liked, and in their caprice or hostility <lb/>
no man was safe. While Sir Patrick Hume was <lb/>
almost in daily expectation of being seized as a <lb/>
suspected person, we turn for a moment to his friend, <lb/>
Robert Baillie of Jerviswood, who was less fortunate <lb/>
in maintaining a state of immunity.</p>
<p>Special attention had two or three years previously <lb/>
been drawn to Baillie by a somewhat curious <reg orig="circum-|stance">circumstance</reg>. <lb/>
His brother-in-law, the Rev. Mr Kirkton, a <lb/>
nonconformist minister, was one day civilly accosted <lb/>
in the High Street of Edinburgh by a man named <lb/>
Carstairs, who expressed a desire to speak to him in <lb/>
private. Suspecting no evil, he followed the stranger <lb/>
to a mean-looking house, which he no sooner entered <lb/>
than the door was shut and locked upon him, his <lb/>
captor hurrying off in quest of a warrant to place <lb/>
him in confinement. Carstairs was a spy of <reg orig="Arch-|bishop">Archbishop</reg> <lb/>
Sharp, and to gain a reward as an informer <lb/>
on what he presumed to be a suspected recusant, he <lb/>
had resorted to this man&oelig;uvre. The cries made by <lb/>
Kirkton brought people to the door, and at his <lb/>
request Baillie, who happened to be in town, was <lb/>
brought to his succour. Carstairs returned, as he <lb/>
said, with a warrant, but he refused to show it; <lb/>
whereupon a desperate struggle took place, in which <lb/>
<pb n="159" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0172"/>
he was worsted, and Kirkton got away with his <lb/>
friend. The end of the affair was that Baillie was <lb/>
subjected to a fine of 6000 merks &lpar;&pound;318&rpar;, and <lb/>
refusing to pay, was put in prison. Through the <lb/>
influence of the Scottish gentry, who brought pressure <lb/>
to bear upon the authorities, he was released after <lb/>
being in prison about four months on payment of <lb/>
half of the fine. This was but the beginning of <lb/>
ruination. Being charged with conspiracy to raise <lb/>
rebellion, and for concern in the Rye-House Plot, <lb/>
with which he was no way connected, he was <reg orig="im-|prisoned">imprisoned</reg>, <lb/>
and fined in the heavy sum of &pound;6000, being <lb/>
nearly the value of his whole estates.</p>
<p>At this time Grisell Hume was about seventeen <lb/>
years of age. Well educated, according to the notion <lb/>
of the period, she was also accomplished in household <lb/>
work, such as spinning wool and flax to be woven <lb/>
into webs for domestic use; and likewise skilled in <lb/>
matters connected with the dairy. Her mother, <lb/>
Lady Hume, being unfortunately in a weak state of <lb/>
health, the management of the family was assigned <lb/>
to her, and cleverly she acquitted herself. Young as <lb/>
she was, her father took her into counsel respecting <lb/>
public affairs, and the perils with which he was <lb/>
surrounded. On two occasions, she was despatched <lb/>
on a mission to Baillie of Jerviswood while he was <lb/>
confined in the Tolbooth of Edinburgh. The journey <lb/>
was full of danger, for the country swarmed with <lb/>
detachments of soldiers, charged to examine travellers, <lb/>
and discover whom they were and what were their <lb/>
designs. Grisell carried no papers; the messages <lb/>
transmitted to and fro were verbal, and required a <lb/>
good memory, as well as tact in concealing them from <lb/>
<pb n="160" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0173"/>
the inquiry of strangers. The journey from Redbraes <lb/>
to Edinburgh was at least fifty miles, and performed <lb/>
on horseback, could not, considering the badness of <lb/>
the roads and the necessity for making a circuit to <lb/>
avoid towns, be performed in less than from two to <lb/>
three days.</p>
<p>In these hazardous excursions, she was sometimes <lb/>
put to considerable straits to avoid being stopped and <lb/>
questioned. In one of her journeys, she took the <lb/>
road by way of Earlston, and there learned that the <lb/>
passes northwards were strongly guarded. In her <lb/>
extremity, she was succoured by a party of gipsies, <lb/>
to one of whom, a female named Jean Gordon, she <lb/>
had done an act of kindness. Taking her under <lb/>
their guidance, the party led her by obscure byways <lb/>
to Lowrie's Den, a small and lonely hostel on the top <lb/>
of Soutra Hill, where, disguised in gipsy garments, <lb/>
she was accommodated in an outhouse for the night; <lb/>
and next morning she was escorted safely on her <lb/>
way into Mid-Lothian. The scenes she encountered <lb/>
on reaching Edinburgh were sufficiently appalling. <lb/>
Executions were of daily occurrence, and the ports of <lb/>
the ancient city bristled with the heads of so-called <lb/>
traitors. How she managed to gain access to that <lb/>
grim old Tolbooth is not related. Probably it was <lb/>
through the interest of some friends or relatives of <lb/>
Mr Baillie. At all events, she was allowed on each <lb/>
occasion to have a private interview with that <reg orig="un-|fortunate">unfortunate</reg> <lb/>
gentleman in the loathsome small <reg orig="apart-|ment">apartment</reg> <lb/>
in which he was confined, in the east or <lb/>
criminal division of the prison. There she delivered <lb/>
the messages from her father, and received verbal <lb/>
communications in reply. At one, or it might have <lb/>
<pb n="161" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0174"/>
been at both interviews, Grisell met and conversed <lb/>
with George Baillie, younger of Jerviswood, eldest <lb/>
son of the prisoner. He was over two years her <lb/>
senior. A community of danger and fears led to <lb/>
mutual regard and attachment. At present thoughts <lb/>
of marriage were out of the question. The feelings <lb/>
of both were centred in the condition of their <reg orig="respec-|tive">respective</reg> <lb/>
fathers. Grisell's last visit to the Tolbooth was <lb/>
necessarily hurried. She had to hasten home, in <lb/>
consequence of increasing apprehensions as to her <lb/>
father's safety. Not long afterwards the fate of <lb/>
Baillie of Jerviswood was sealed. On the 23d of <lb/>
December 1684, he was brought before the High <lb/>
Court of Justiciary. He was now so weak as to be <lb/>
obliged to appear at the bar in the deshabille of his <lb/>
dressing-gown, and frequently to take cordials, which <lb/>
were supplied to him by his sister. He solemnly <lb/>
denied having been accessory to any conspiracy <lb/>
against the king's life, or of being unfavourably <lb/>
disposed to monarchical government. The only <lb/>
evidence brought against him were confessions <reg orig="ex-|torted">extorted</reg> <lb/>
by the torture of the 'thumbikens'&mdash;an <reg orig="in-|strument">instrument</reg> <lb/>
which, working like a vice, crushed the <lb/>
thumbs, and produced the most excruciating agony. <lb/>
On such imperfect and untrustworthy evidence, he <lb/>
was, on the morning of the succeeding day, declared <lb/>
to be guilty, and sentenced to be executed that <lb/>
afternoon at the Cross of Edinburgh; his body to be <lb/>
dismembered, and portions to be exhibited on the <lb/>
prisons of four different towns. On receiving his <lb/>
sentence, he said, 'My lords, the time is short, the <lb/>
sentence is sharp; but I thank my God, who hath <lb/>
made me as fit to die as you are to live.' With <lb/>
<pb n="162" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0175"/>
extraordinary composure, in a pious frame of mind, <lb/>
he ascended the scaffold leaning on the arm of his <lb/>
sister &lpar;Mrs Ker of Graden&rpar;, and protesting his <lb/>
innocence, meekly submitted himself to the <reg orig="execu-|tioner">executioner</reg>.</p>
<p>Thus was ignominiously put to death Robert <lb/>
Baillie of Jerviswood, a man of sterling worth and <lb/>
abilities, and who has been commemorated as the <lb/>
'Scottish Sidney.' By the forfeiture of his estates <lb/>
his family were completely ruined. His son, George, <lb/>
like many others at the time, took refuge in <lb/>
Holland. Our interest is now transferred to the <lb/>
unhappy family at Redbraes. For some weeks, Sir <lb/>
Patrick Hume had gone into hiding. The place <lb/>
selected for his concealment was the old sepulchral <lb/>
vault of the family, underneath the parish church at <lb/>
Polwarth, which, as has been said, is about two <lb/>
miles from Redbraes Castle. Besides Lady Hume <lb/>
and Grisell, only one person was let into the secret <lb/>
of his hiding-place. This was Jamie Winter, a <lb/>
carpenter, who lived a mile off, and used to do odd <lb/>
jobs of work about the house. On the fidelity of <lb/>
Jamie they thought they could depend, and were <lb/>
not disappointed. By the assistance of this man <lb/>
they got a mattress and bed-clothes, a small table <lb/>
and chair, and some other articles, carried during <lb/>
the night to the vault. In the daytime, the vault <lb/>
was lighted only by a small slit in the wall at one <lb/>
end, through which nobody could see what was <lb/>
below. Here Sir Patrick lived part of the autumn <lb/>
of 1684, without fire, and surrounded by the <reg orig="moulder-|ing">mouldering</reg> <lb/>
remains of his ancestors and other ghastly <lb/>
objects. Though infirm in health, he was enabled <lb/>
<pb n="163" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0176"/>
to endure the privations of this dreary hiding-place, <lb/>
by the strength of his mind, and the affectionate <lb/>
ministrations of his daughter Grisell. For warmth <lb/>
he wore a Kilmarnock nightcap. His chief mental <lb/>
solacement consisted in perusing Buchanan's Latin <lb/>
version of the Psalms, a book which, during his <lb/>
dismal solitude, he learned to repeat from memory. <lb/>
It seems that, when sitting one night at table <reg orig="read-|ing">reading</reg> <lb/>
this favourite work, by the light of a small and <lb/>
carefully shrouded lamp, his eye happened to stray <lb/>
towards a skull which lay near his feet. To his <lb/>
surprise, the skull moved. He was at first disturbed <lb/>
in mind by this strange circumstance; but soon <lb/>
recovered his composure. In a short time the <lb/>
motion became too strong to be doubtful. Sir <lb/>
Patrick had the courage to turn over the skull with <lb/>
his cane, when a mouse jumped from the interior, <lb/>
and afforded an explanation of the phenomenon. <lb/>
He used to tell this story in after-life, to shew that <lb/>
people should not be alarmed at things which may <lb/>
appear supernatural.</p>
<p>His daughter Grisell must have possessed a degree <lb/>
of fortitude not inferior to his own. She went every <lb/>
night, alone, at midnight, along a dreary road, to <lb/>
carry him victuals and drink; always staying with <lb/>
him as long as she could, getting home before day. <lb/>
Though possessing some dread in crossing the <reg orig="church-|yard">churchyard</reg> <lb/>
in the dark, stumbling over graves, her only <lb/>
real apprehension was the fear of soldiers and parties <lb/>
in search of her father. In these excursions the <lb/>
least noise was alarming. There was another cause <lb/>
of anxiety. This was the difficulty of getting <lb/>
victuals to carry off without arousing the suspicions <lb/>
<pb n="164" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0177"/>
of the servants. A diverting incident has been <lb/>
related. Her father liked sheep's head. One day, <lb/>
at dinner, this favourite dish appeared at table. <lb/>
While the children were supping their broth, Grisell <lb/>
had the dexterity to convey the greater part of the <lb/>
head into her lap. When her brother Sandy had <lb/>
finished his broth, he looked up with astonishment, <lb/>
and said: 'Mother, will ye look at Grisell; while <lb/>
we have been supping our broth, she has eaten up <lb/>
nearly the whole sheep's head!' This occasioned so <lb/>
much mirth amongst them, that her father at night <lb/>
was greatly entertained by it, and desired that <lb/>
Sandy should have a share of the next.</p>
<p>The damp and gloomy vault became at length <lb/>
unendurable as a habitation, and a new expedient <lb/>
was adopted. With the aid of Jamie Winter, a hole <lb/>
was excavated in the lower floor of the family <lb/>
residence, and filled up with a box to contain a bed, <lb/>
which was concealed under the boards. To this <lb/>
place of concealment, Sir Patrick was brought, and <lb/>
by means of air-holes in the floor, he could contrive <lb/>
to live and breathe. It proved a vain effort. One <lb/>
day, after heavy rains, the bed was full of water, <lb/>
and had to be given up. At this juncture, a carrier <lb/>
arrived from Edinburgh, bringing the news of <lb/>
Baillie of Jerviswood's barbarous execution. As all <lb/>
intercourse by letters was dangerous, this was the <lb/>
first notice they had of the melancholy event. It <lb/>
was now seen that Sir Patrick Hume should, if at all <lb/>
possible, make his escape from the country. Grisell <lb/>
worked night and day, making clothes in which he <lb/>
would be disguised. When all was ready for <lb/>
departure, he set out early in the morning on <reg orig="horse-|back">horseback</reg>, <lb/>
<pb n="165" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0178"/>
attended by John Allan, his grieve, or <reg orig="farm-|overseer">farmoverseer</reg>, <lb/>
in whom confidence could be placed. The <lb/>
party had proceeded a considerable distance on their <lb/>
way, when Sir Patrick, falling into a reverie, parted <lb/>
company with his attendant, and did not discover <lb/>
the mistake till he found himself close to the Tweed. <lb/>
This, however, was a fortunate misadventure, for <lb/>
soon after his parting with Allan, a company of <lb/>
soldiers that had been in search of him at Redbraes, <lb/>
and followed, in expectation of overtaking him, came <lb/>
up, and would inevitably have discovered and seized <lb/>
him, if he had not been on another track. On <reg orig="learn-|ing">learning</reg> <lb/>
what had happened, he dismissed his attendant, <lb/>
and, leaving the main-road, reached London through <lb/>
byways. During the journey, he represented <reg orig="him-|self">himself</reg> <lb/>
as a surgeon, a character he could have supported <lb/>
effectually; for he carried a case of lancets, and was <lb/>
acquainted with their use. From London he found <lb/>
his way to France, and thence, after a short stay, <lb/>
passed by way of Brussels to Holland. In the <lb/>
following year, he acted as one of the two seconds in <lb/>
command in the unfortunate expedition of the Earl of <lb/>
Argyll, and once more with great difficulty made an <lb/>
escape to Holland, while his property was forfeited <lb/>
to the government. He now established himself at <lb/>
Utrecht with his family, and commenced a life of <lb/>
penury forming a remarkable contrast to his previous <lb/>
circumstances. One child, named Juliana, had been <lb/>
left in Scotland on account of bad health. Some <lb/>
months after settling in Holland, it was thought <lb/>
necessary that this girl should be sent for, and Grisell <lb/>
was commissioned to return in order to bring her <lb/>
away. She was intrusted, at the same time, with <lb/>
<pb n="166" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0179"/>
the management of some business of her father's, <lb/>
and directed to collect what she could of the money <lb/>
that was due to them. All this she performed with <lb/>
her usual discretion and success, though not without <lb/>
encountering adventures that would have completely <lb/>
overwhelmed the greater part of her sex. After <lb/>
enduring a storm at sea, the terrors of which were <lb/>
aggravated by the barbarity of a brutal shipmaster, <lb/>
the two girls were landed at Brill; and from thence <lb/>
they set out the same night for Rotterdam, in <lb/>
company with a Scotch gentleman whom they <reg orig="acci-|dentally">accidentally</reg> <lb/>
met with. It was a cold, wet night; and <lb/>
Juliana Hume, who was hardly able to walk, soon <lb/>
lost her shoes in the mud. Grisell then took the <lb/>
ailing child on her back, and carried her all the way <lb/>
to Rotterdam; while the gentleman, a sympathising <lb/>
fellow-exile, bore their small baggage. All these <lb/>
distresses were forgotten when she once more found <lb/>
herself in the bosom of her family.</p>
<p>Sir Patrick spent three years and a half in <lb/>
Holland. His income was small and precarious, <lb/>
and a fourth part of it was required for the <reg orig="house-|rent">houserent</reg>. <lb/>
As he was unable to keep any servant, besides <lb/>
a girl to wash clothes, his heroic daughter performed <lb/>
the greater part of the domestic drudgery, for which <lb/>
purpose she often was up for two nights in the <lb/>
week. According to the simple and affecting <reg orig="narra-|tive">narrative</reg> <lb/>
of her daughter, Lady Murray of Stanhope, 'she <lb/>
went to the market, went to the mill to have their <lb/>
corn ground&mdash;which, it seems, is the way with good <lb/>
managers there&mdash;dressed the linen, cleaned the house, <lb/>
made ready dinner, mended the children's stockings <lb/>
and other clothes, made what she could for them, <lb/>
<pb n="167" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0180"/>
and, in short, did everything. Her sister Christian, <lb/>
who was a year or two younger, diverted her father <lb/>
and mother and the rest, who were fond of music: <lb/>
out of their small income they bought a harpsichord <lb/>
for little money. My aunt played and sung well, <lb/>
and had a great deal of life and humour, but no turn <lb/>
for business. Though my mother had the same <lb/>
qualifications, and liked it as well as she did, she <lb/>
was forced to drudge; and many jokes used to pass <lb/>
between the sisters about their different occupations. <lb/>
Every morning before six, my mother lighted her <lb/>
father's fire in his study, then waked him, and got <lb/>
what he usually took as soon as he got up&mdash;warm <lb/>
small-beer, with a spoonful of bitters in it; then <lb/>
took up the children, and brought them all to his <lb/>
room, where he taught them everything that was fit <lb/>
for their age: some Latin, others French, Dutch, <lb/>
geography, writing, reading, English, &amp;c.; and my <lb/>
grandmother taught them what was necessary on <lb/>
her part. Thus he employed and diverted himself <lb/>
all the time he was there, not being able to afford <lb/>
putting them to school; and my mother, when she <lb/>
had a moment, took a lesson with the rest in French <lb/>
and Dutch, and also diverted herself with music. I <lb/>
have now a book of songs, of her writing when she <lb/>
was there; many of them interrupted, half-writ, <lb/>
some broke off in the middle of a sentence. She had <lb/>
no less a turn for mirth and society than any of the <lb/>
family, when she could come at it without neglecting <lb/>
what she thought more necessary.'</p>
<p>Lady Murray, in her interesting work, gives the <lb/>
following description of the personal appearance of <lb/>
her mother about this time. She says: 'Her actions <lb/>
<pb n="168" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0181"/>
show what her mind was, and her outward <reg orig="appear-|ance">appearance</reg> <lb/>
was no less singular. She was middle sized, <lb/>
well made, clever in her person, very handsome, <lb/>
and with a light and sweetness in her eyes very <lb/>
uncommon, and great delicacy in all her features; <lb/>
her hair was chestnut, and to the last she had the <lb/>
finest complexion, with the clearest red on her <lb/>
cheeks and lips that could be seen in one of fifteen, <lb/>
which, added to her natural constitution, might be <lb/>
owing to the great moderation she had in her diet <lb/>
throughout life. Pottage and milk was her greatest <lb/>
feast, and by choice preferred them to anything, <lb/>
though nothing came wrong to her that others <lb/>
could eat. Water she preferred to any liquor; <lb/>
though often obliged to take a glass of wine, she <lb/>
always did it unwillingly, thinking it hurt her, and <lb/>
did not like it.'</p>
<p>Her eldest brother Patrick, and her lover Mr <lb/>
Baillie, who suffered under the consequences of his <lb/>
father's attainder, went together into the guards of <lb/>
the Prince of Orange, till such time as they could be <lb/>
better provided for in the army. 'Her constant <lb/>
attention,' continues Lady Murray, 'was to have her <lb/>
brother appear right in his linen and dress: they <lb/>
wore little point cravats and cuffs, which many a <lb/>
night she sat up to have in as good order for him as <lb/>
any in the place; and one of their greatest expenses <lb/>
was in dressing him as he ought to be. As their <lb/>
house was always full of the unfortunate banished <lb/>
people like themselves, they seldom went to dinner <lb/>
without three, or four, or five of them to share with <lb/>
them;' and it used to excite their surprise that, <reg orig="not-|withstanding">notwithstanding</reg> <lb/>
this hospitality, their limited resources <lb/>
<pb n="169" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0182"/>
were sufficient, except on rare occasions, to supply <lb/>
their wants.</p>
<p>When subsequently invested with a title, and the <lb/>
wife of a wealthy gentleman, the subject of our <lb/>
memoir used to declare, that these years of privation <lb/>
and drudgery had been the most delightful of her <lb/>
whole life; a circumstance not surprising, when we <lb/>
consider the gratification which high moral feelings <lb/>
like hers could not fail to derive from exercise of so <lb/>
peculiar a nature. Some of the distresses of the <lb/>
exiled family only served to supply them with <lb/>
amusement. Andrew, a boy, afterwards a judge of <lb/>
the Court of Session, was one day sent down to the <lb/>
cellar for a glass of alabast beer, the only liquor <lb/>
with which Sir Patrick could entertain his friends. <lb/>
On his returning with the beer, Sir Patrick said: <lb/>
'Andrew, what is that in your other hand?' It was <lb/>
the spigot, which the youth had forgotten to replace, <lb/>
and the want of which had already lost them the <lb/>
whole of their stock of alabast. This occasioned <lb/>
them much mirth, though they perhaps did not <lb/>
know where to get more. It was the custom at <lb/>
Utrecht to gather money for the poor, by going from <lb/>
house to house with a hand-bell. One night the bell <lb/>
came, and there was nothing in the house but a <lb/>
single orkey, the smallest coin then used in Holland. <lb/>
They were so much ashamed of their poverty, that <lb/>
no one would go out with the money, till Sir Patrick <lb/>
himself at last undertook this troublesome little <lb/>
duty, observing philosophically: 'We can give no <lb/>
more than all we have.' Their want of money often <lb/>
obliged them to pawn the small quantity of plate <lb/>
which they had brought from Scotland; but they <lb/>
<pb n="170" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0183"/>
were ultimately able to take it all back with them, <lb/>
leaving no debt in the country of their exile.</p>
<p>What followed belongs to history. Sir Patrick <lb/>
Hume made a distinguished figure in the new <lb/>
government of William and Mary. His attainder <lb/>
was reversed by parliament, and, as a testimony of <lb/>
his virtues and sufferings, he was created a peer by <lb/>
the title of Lord Polwarth. In 1696, he was <reg orig="pro-|moted">promoted</reg> <lb/>
to be Earl of Marchmont. This illustrious <lb/>
patriot died in 1724. He was succeeded by his <lb/>
eldest surviving son, Alexander&mdash;the Sandy of the <lb/>
anecdote about the sheep's head&mdash;who, having <reg orig="pre-|viously">previously</reg> <lb/>
married the daughter and heiress of Campbell <lb/>
of Cessnock, added Campbell to the family surname. <lb/>
The Marchmont peerage became extinct through the <lb/>
failure of male heirs in 1793. The claim to be <lb/>
Baron Polwarth was allowed by parliament, in 1835, <lb/>
to Hugh Scott of Harden, whose father had married <lb/>
Lady Diana Hume-Campbell, daughter of Hugh, <lb/>
third Earl of Marchmont.</p>
<p>We now have to speak of the fortunes of the <lb/>
heroic Grisell. Returning to England with the <lb/>
Princess of Orange, she got an offer of being one <lb/>
of her maids of honour, but this she declined, and <lb/>
chose going to Scotland with the rest of the family. <lb/>
The attachment between her and George Baillie was <lb/>
not made known until the reversal of the forfeiture <lb/>
of the Jerviswood estate, when, there being no longer <lb/>
a necessity for keeping the matter a secret, the two <lb/>
by general assent were married on 17th September <lb/>
1692. She had now, in virtue of her father's <lb/>
earldom, the title of 'lady,' and became known as <lb/>
Lady Grisell Baillie of Jerviswood. She is stated to <lb/>
<pb n="171" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0184"/>
have had a peculiarly happy married life, and to <lb/>
have been most exemplary in all the duties of her <lb/>
station. She had one son, who died in infancy, and <lb/>
two daughters, Grisell and Rachel. The former <lb/>
was married to Mr Murray, afterwards Sir <reg orig="Alex-|ander">Alexander</reg> <lb/>
Murray of Stanhope; the latter, to Charles <lb/>
Lord Binning, eldest son of Thomas, sixth Earl of <lb/>
Haddington, from whom are descended the present <lb/>
families of Haddington and of Baillie of Jerviswood. <lb/>
The heroine of our story, if it can be called so, died <lb/>
in London in 1746, having outlived George Baillie <lb/>
eight years. Her last expressed wish was to be <lb/>
buried beside him at Mellerstain, and, with <reg orig="char-|acteristic">characteristic</reg> <lb/>
forethought, she left for this purpose a <lb/>
purse of money in her cabinet. Her daughter, Lady <lb/>
Murray, who has written her Memoirs, was <reg orig="unfor-|tunate">unfortunate</reg> <lb/>
in her marriage, though we do not learn the <lb/>
the particulars. Sir Alexander Murray of Stanhope <lb/>
dying without issue, was succeeded by his nephew, <lb/>
Sir David Murray, who, for his concern in the <lb/>
rebellion of 1745, was condemned to death; but, as <lb/>
an act of royal clemency, his life was spared, and he <lb/>
went into banishment. The Stanhope estates were, <lb/>
however, forfeited and sold. As regards Lady <lb/>
Grisell Baillie, her memory has been preserved not <lb/>
alone by her heroism in early life. Possessing no <lb/>
mean poetic talent, she is embraced in the list of <lb/>
songstresses of Scotland, her best known piece being <lb/>
the ballad, 'Werena my heart licht, I wad dee,' <lb/>
which, original and amusing, is found in most of <lb/>
the popular collections.</p>

<p>EVERY now and then <lb/>
we meet with some <lb/>
striking instances of <lb/>
self-sacrifice in the <lb/>
cause of humanity, <lb/>
occurring in such <lb/>
obscure circumstances <lb/>
as clearly to indicate <lb/>
that they arise from <lb/>
the purest emotions of <lb/>
benevolence. Of that <lb/>
species of quietly <lb/>
demonstrated <reg orig="bene-|volence">benevolence</reg> <lb/>
which has the true ring about it, we have <lb/>
always looked with satisfaction on the case of John <lb/>
Pounds, the poor Portsmouth shoemaker, who with <lb/>
an inborn passion for gratuitous teaching, daily <lb/>
gathered a crowd of neglected and half-starved <lb/>
children into his humble booth, and taught them <lb/>
to read while hammering his leather and mending <lb/>
the soles of old boots. John, who has been long <lb/>
dead and gone, did not get much credit for his <lb/>
labours during his lifetime, but he nevertheless <lb/>
deserves to be mentioned as the real pioneer in <lb/>
what is now called ragged-school training.</p>
<pb n="173" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0186"/>
<p>John Howard, and afterwards Mrs Fry, took a <lb/>
prominent place as leading reformers in prison <lb/>
discipline, and for their untiring exertions in the <lb/>
cause of suffering humanity they will ever be <lb/>
held in remembrance. Both, however, as is well <lb/>
known, moved in a good sphere of society. They <lb/>
were persons of fortune, and could afford to give <lb/>
time and money in carrying out their benevolent <lb/>
enterprises. But Sarah Martin was only a poor <lb/>
dressmaker who had to toil for her daily bread, <lb/>
while striving to help and uplift others.</p>
<p>Sarah was a reformer of prison management in the <lb/>
early part of the present century, and hence was <lb/>
contemporaneous with Mrs Fry; but her field of <lb/>
labour was of a local character, and much less a <lb/>
matter of general observation. If a hundred men or <lb/>
women with similar intentions had scattered <reg orig="them-|selves">themselves</reg> <lb/>
over the country, each fixing on a particular <lb/>
jail as a scene of operation, there would have been <lb/>
room for them all. The prisons, big and little, were <lb/>
simply a disgrace; only no one in high quarters <lb/>
thought much of what was so discreditable. A <lb/>
prison was traditionally reckoned to be a kind of <lb/>
pinfold, into which all sorts of human wreck of a <lb/>
perversely troublesome kind should be thrust <reg orig="pell-|mell">pellmell</reg>, <lb/>
and there left to be dealt with by magistrates, <lb/>
hangmen, grave-diggers, or anybody. Who cared <lb/>
about what was going on in the prisons? Such <lb/>
establishments might be sinks of vice and suffering. <lb/>
The worse for those who got into them&mdash;they should <lb/>
have taken better care! That was the whole <lb/>
philosophy of the question at a period within the <lb/>
memory of persons still living.</p>
<pb n="174" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0187"/>
<p>On this fighting, brawling, miserably suffering, <lb/>
selfish era, Sarah Martin arose like an angel of <lb/>
mercy. Born in 1791, she was the daughter of a <lb/>
small tradesman in the village of Caister, near <lb/>
Yarmouth, on the coast of Norfolk. Her education, <lb/>
of the most meagre kind, began at a dame-school in <lb/>
the village. Having the misfortune to lose her <lb/>
parents, she was thrown on the kindness of her <lb/>
grandmother, who could do nothing else than put <lb/>
her, at from fourteen to fifteen years of age, to <lb/>
learn the business of dressmaking in Yarmouth. It <lb/>
speaks not a little for the skill and spirit of industry <lb/>
in the poor orphan, that after about two years' <lb/>
training she began as a dressmaker on her own <lb/>
account. As such, in a limited way, she was <lb/>
tolerably successful, being favoured with <reg orig="employ-|ment">employment</reg> <lb/>
from several respectable families in the <lb/>
place.</p>
<p>Henceforth, to the end of her days, we are to view <lb/>
Sarah Martin as gaining her livelihood by going out <lb/>
to shape and sew for those requiring her services, <lb/>
her requital being at most only a few shillings a day. <lb/>
In her occupation there was, perhaps, little room to <lb/>
expand; nor does it appear that she ever aimed at <lb/>
rising to eminence in her profession. The facts <lb/>
regarding her business are rather scanty. We <lb/>
only know that she was satisfied with her <reg orig="posi-|tion">position</reg>, <lb/>
and commanded respect by the modesty of <lb/>
her demeanour. Though inclined to novel-reading, <lb/>
she was never the least light-headed. Like many <lb/>
young women in similar circumstances, she might <lb/>
doubtless have put on a good deal of sham finery, <lb/>
and tried to cut a dash as a holiday belle. To make <lb/>
<pb n="175" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0188"/>
herself attractive or conspicuous in this fashion was <lb/>
not, however, to her taste. Naturally staid and <lb/>
thoughtful, she happily, when no more than nineteen <lb/>
years of age, heard a sermon preached, which by its <lb/>
persuasive piety gave a distinctly religious turn to <lb/>
her feelings; and following up the impulse by a <lb/>
frequent perusal of the Scriptures, a new view <lb/>
of what should be her course of duty dawned upon <lb/>
her.</p>
<p>Now commences the young dressmaker's <reg orig="self-|imposed">self-imposed</reg> <lb/>
mission in the work of teaching and <reg orig="reclama-|tion">reclamation</reg>. <lb/>
The ignorant, the friendless, the degraded, <lb/>
were to be the special objects of her solicitude. Her <lb/>
earliest efforts lay in the direction of Sunday-school <lb/>
teaching; from which she advanced to attendance in <lb/>
the workhouse, where she became a fervent visitor <lb/>
and consoler of the sick, the aged, and the afflicted. <lb/>
For the children in this resort of parochial <reg orig="destitu-|tion">destitution</reg> <lb/>
she was graciously allowed to devote a day in <lb/>
the week, at her own pecuniary loss, to some kind <lb/>
of primary instruction. To these duties, which <lb/>
encroached on her means of subsistence, were in time <lb/>
added visits to the destitute sick throughout the <lb/>
town, everywhere carrying spiritual consolation, and <lb/>
planning the elevation of the abandoned and <lb/>
irresolute. In this manner beginning her career, <lb/>
and gaining friends by the obvious simplicity of her <lb/>
character, she extended her ministrations to the town <lb/>
prison, a neglected den of infamy and misery, which <lb/>
stood prodigiously in need of some such benevolent <lb/>
visitor. She is said to have ventured on this unusual <lb/>
undertaking by hearing of a woman who had been <lb/>
imprisoned on account of barbarous cruelty to her <lb/>
<pb n="176" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0189"/>
child. Often in passing the jail Sarah had yearned <lb/>
to get within its portal, in order to read the <reg orig="Scrip-|tures">Scriptures</reg> <lb/>
to its inmates, and attempt to stimulate their <lb/>
better feelings; but it was only now she mustered <lb/>
courage to make the effort. Timidly she requested <lb/>
permission to perform the visit of mercy, but was <lb/>
refused. The check, though discouraging, did not <lb/>
turn her from her purpose. She made a second <lb/>
attempt, and this time she had the gratification of <lb/>
being admitted&mdash;admitted as a favour to a prison <lb/>
from which all of a respectable caste shrunk with <lb/>
horror.</p>
<p>The Yarmouth prison as it then existed is pictured <lb/>
to have been of the lowest type&mdash;confined, <reg orig="loath-|some">loathsome</reg>, <lb/>
dirty, scarcely any division of the sexes, the <lb/>
inmates gambling, fighting, boastful over their <lb/>
villainous exploits, and rejoicing in contrivances <lb/>
for fresh delinquencies, with no chaplain or other <lb/>
authority to mitigate their brutality. Into this <lb/>
horrid arena of uproar and disgust, the poor <reg orig="dress-|maker">dressmaker</reg> <lb/>
voluntarily entered, in the hope of reclaiming <lb/>
deserted and hopeless iniquity. The woman who <lb/>
was the primary object of her mission was surprised <lb/>
to find that any one cared for her, and soon melting <lb/>
into tears, thanked her kindly disposed visitor. So <lb/>
encouraged, Sarah read and expounded passages in <lb/>
the New Testament to other inmates who would <lb/>
listen to her. In these well-meant endeavours she <lb/>
encountered numerous unpleasant rebuffs. But jeers, <lb/>
coarse abuse, and unmanly insolence were held as <lb/>
nothing under a high sense of duty. Never <reg orig="falter-|ing">faltering</reg> <lb/>
in her attempts, her simplicity and her <reg orig="gentle-|ness">gentleness</reg> <lb/>
won on hearts steeled to ordinary impressions. <lb/>
<pb entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0190"/>
<figure id="f31" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0190" rend="page">
<head>SARAH MARTIN IN YARMOUTH JAIL.</head>
</figure>
<pb entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0191"/>
<pb n="179" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0192"/>
Sometimes she was shocked with the scenes that <lb/>
were presented, as well as with the language that <lb/>
met her ear; still she persevered, and gradually <lb/>
gained that degree of respect and confidence which <lb/>
gave her an ascendency over even the most <reg orig="profli-|gate">profligate</reg>. <lb/>
Of course, she did not reach this measure of <lb/>
success without a heavy sacrifice of time and trouble, <lb/>
or in other words of loss in her means of livelihood. <lb/>
As if this were but a secondary consideration, she <lb/>
actually gave up every Monday to unpaid work in <lb/>
the prison. This was in addition to her attendance <lb/>
on Sundays, on which she effected the introduction <lb/>
of regular divine service; and what is still more <lb/>
remarkable, she, in the absence of anything better, <lb/>
delivered sermons and addresses of her own <reg orig="composi-|tion">composition</reg>, <lb/>
that are said to have been singularly <reg orig="appro-|priate">appropriate</reg> <lb/>
and efficacious.</p>
<p>Sarah Martin was a Christian after the manner <lb/>
of the evangelists; and she does not appear to have <lb/>
harassed either herself or her hearers with doctrinal <lb/>
difficulties or ecclesiastical disputes. She spoke <lb/>
expressly to the understanding and feelings; and, <lb/>
like the good vicar of Wakefield in similar <reg orig="cir-|cumstances">circumstances</reg>, <lb/>
described, in simple and affecting <reg orig="lan-|guage">language</reg>, <lb/>
the superior advantages of virtue over vice, <lb/>
of good over bad conduct, along with the hopes <lb/>
of a blessed immortality enjoyed by those who <lb/>
follow the injunctions of the gospel. Speaking <lb/>
of the efficacy of these prelections, one writer <lb/>
observes: 'The cold, laboured eloquence which <reg orig="boy-|bachelors">boybachelors</reg> <lb/>
are authorised by custom and constituted <lb/>
authority to inflict upon us&mdash;the dry husks and <lb/>
chips of divinity which they bring forth from the <lb/>
<pb n="180" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0193"/>
dark recesses of theology &lpar;as it is called&rpar; of the <lb/>
Fathers, or of the middle ages&mdash;sink into utter <lb/>
worthlessness by the side of the jail addresses of this <lb/>
poor uneducated seamstress.' Of whom was her <lb/>
congregation usually composed? 'Pert London <reg orig="pick-|pockets">pick-pockets</reg>, <lb/>
whom a cheap steamboat brought to reap a <lb/>
harvest at some country festival; boors, whom <lb/>
ignorance and distress led into thefts; depraved boys, <lb/>
who picked up a precarious livelihood amongst the <lb/>
chances of a seaport town; sailors, who had <reg orig="com-|mitted">committed</reg> <lb/>
assaults in the boisterous hilarity consequent <lb/>
upon a discharge with a paid-up arrear of wages; <lb/>
servants, of both sexes, seduced by bad company into <lb/>
the commission of crimes against their masters; <lb/>
profligate women, who had added assault or theft <lb/>
to the ordinary vices of a licentious life; smugglers; <lb/>
a few game-law criminals; and paupers, transferred <lb/>
from a workhouse, where they had been initiated <lb/>
into crime, to a jail, where their knowledge was <lb/>
perfected. Such were some of the usual classes <lb/>
who assembled around this singular teacher of <lb/>
righteousness.'</p>
<p>We are afforded a glimpse of what she did in this <lb/>
department of her labours in the report of an official <lb/>
visitor to the prison. It is dated Sunday, November <lb/>
29, 1835. 'Attended divine service in the morning <lb/>
at the prison. The male prisoners only were <lb/>
assembled. A female resident in the town officiated. <lb/>
Her voice was exceedingly melodious, her delivery <lb/>
emphatic, and her enunciation extremely distinct. <lb/>
The service was the liturgy of the Church of <lb/>
England. Two psalms were sung by the whole of <lb/>
the prisoners, and extremely well&mdash;much better than <lb/>
<pb n="181" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0194"/>
I have heard in our best-appointed churches. A <lb/>
written discourse, of her own composition, was read <lb/>
by her. It was of a purely moral tendency, <reg orig="in-|volving">involving</reg> <lb/>
no doctrinal points, and admirably suited <lb/>
to the hearers. During the performance of the <lb/>
service, the prisoners paid the most profound <reg orig="atten-|tion">attention</reg> <lb/>
and the most marked respect; and as far as it <lb/>
is possible to judge, appeared to take a devout <lb/>
interest. Evening service was read by her <reg orig="after-|wards">afterwards</reg> <lb/>
to the female prisoners.'</p>
<p>But this zealous prison apostle did not confine <lb/>
herself to reading and general instruction. She had <lb/>
the tact to perceive that as long as there was <lb/>
nothing but sheer idleness among the prisoners there <lb/>
was little chance of their moral and intellectual <lb/>
improvement. Accordingly, she introduced various <lb/>
petty industries, such as making straw hats, bone <lb/>
spoons, and boys' caps, and also instructed the women <lb/>
in the sewing of gray cotton shirts. Not stopping at <lb/>
this, she contrived the formation of a fund to furnish <lb/>
work for prisoners when discharged, along with a <lb/>
plan for their outdoor supervision.</p>
<p>It can hardly be supposed that Sarah Martin <lb/>
could in a course of years effect such changes for <lb/>
the better without attracting attention, and raising <lb/>
up friends to help her in the work of benevolence. <lb/>
The public seem to have got a little ashamed that <lb/>
a poor dressmaker, who did not perhaps earn more <lb/>
than ten or twelve shillings a week&mdash;at all events <lb/>
not more than kept her alive and paid for her <lb/>
lodgings&mdash;should have undertaken a task so <reg orig="her-|culean">herculean</reg>, <lb/>
and been so successful. A few began to give <lb/>
her contributions of small sums to purchase Bibles <lb/>
<pb n="182" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0195"/>
and other books requisite to carry out her plans of <lb/>
instruction. The succour came just in time, for she <lb/>
was beginning to experience privations, though <reg orig="pre-|pared">prepared</reg> <lb/>
to submit to want rather than give up her <lb/>
noble enterprise.</p>
<p>Thus did the self-devoted Sarah go on from year <lb/>
to year, heedless of worldly fame or worldly reward. <lb/>
In 1826 she came into the possession of a small <lb/>
annuity of ten or twelve pounds, by the death of <lb/>
her grandmother; but this did not substantially <lb/>
improve her circumstances, for about the same period <lb/>
her employment as a dressmaker declined, in <reg orig="conse-|quence">consequence</reg> <lb/>
of her mind being so much absorbed in her <lb/>
prison labours. It might with some have now been <lb/>
a question whether to relinquish the prison <reg orig="teach-|ings">teachings</reg>, <lb/>
or to go on with them in the midst of poverty. <lb/>
Sarah never hesitated. In the notes she wrote <lb/>
respecting her labours, the noble passage occurs: <lb/>
'My mind, in the contemplation of such trials, <lb/>
seemed exalted by more than human energy; for <lb/>
I had counted the cost, and my mind was made up. <lb/>
If, whilst imparting truth to others, I became exposed <lb/>
to temporal want, the privation so momentary to an <lb/>
individual would not admit of comparison with <lb/>
following the Lord in thus administering to others.'</p>
<p>Ample details were years ago &lpar;April 1847&rpar; <reg orig="pre-|sented">presented</reg> <lb/>
in the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi>, of this remarkable <lb/>
woman, and since that time, a full account has <lb/>
been given in her Memoir, published by the <lb/>
Religious Tract Society. Only a few facts may be <lb/>
added to complete the outline of her career. As <lb/>
the result of assiduous labours, mental and bodily, <lb/>
during a period of twenty years, her health began <lb/>
<pb n="183" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0196"/>
to break down, and jail ministrations had to be <lb/>
relinquished into the hands of those who were <lb/>
regularly constituted for this species of work. Her <lb/>
plans had been successful, not only as regards the <lb/>
reclamation of old and young of both sexes, but had <lb/>
contributed to the establishment of a defined system <lb/>
of prison discipline, such as now prevails. In her <lb/>
later days she gave some superintendence to a <lb/>
school of factory girls, and performed acts of <reg orig="kind-|ness">kindness</reg> <lb/>
in visiting the sick in the poorer parts of the <lb/>
town. At last these labours proved too much for <lb/>
her enfeebled frame, and she lay down to die. Her <lb/>
concluding days were clouded by the pain of an <lb/>
acute complaint, which opiates could but temporarily <lb/>
assuage. She died October 15, 1843, and was <lb/>
interred in the churchyard at Caister.</p>
<p>So terminated the useful and extraordinary career <lb/>
of Sarah Martin, whose name, whose unaffected <lb/>
practical piety, and innumerable good deeds effected <lb/>
under extreme difficulty, we have no small degree of <lb/>
satisfaction in being able to commemorate in these <lb/>
pages. It is painful to think how a really poor <lb/>
woman should have been left to do and suffer so <lb/>
much in the cause of humanity, scarcely receiving <lb/>
thanks for her self-sacrifice. No doubt, she had her <lb/>
own great reward, but that does not lessen our <reg orig="feel-|ing">feeling</reg> <lb/>
of regret that so little was done to show <reg orig="any-|thing">anything</reg> <lb/>
like a general sense of gratitude for her <lb/>
labours during her lifetime. A beautiful window <lb/>
of stained glass was erected to her memory by <lb/>
public subscription in the ancient church of St <lb/>
Nicholas, at Yarmouth, which at least indicates <lb/>
that her modest merits are at length fully <reg orig="appre-|ciated">appreciated</reg>. <lb/>
<pb n="184" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0197"/>
Dr Stanley, Bishop of Norwich at the <lb/>
time of her death, said, 'I would canonise Sarah <lb/>
Martin if I could.' As we have spoken with <reg orig="appro-|bation">approbation</reg> <lb/>
of John Pounds as the pioneer in <reg orig="ragged-|school">raggedschool</reg> <lb/>
instruction, let us do equal justice to Sarah <lb/>
Martin, the humble sempstress of Yarmouth, and <lb/>
help to inscribe her name in the honoured roll <lb/>
of the Howards, Frys, Buxtons, and others who <lb/>
distinguished themselves as reformers of prison <lb/>
discipline.</p>

<figure id="f33" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0198" rend="block"/>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Frances burney</hi>, by marriage Madame <lb/>
D'Arblay, was born at Lynn-Regis in <lb/>
Norfolk, on the 13th of June 1752. At <lb/>
that period her father, Dr Charles Burney, a man of <lb/>
very superior attainments, filled the comparatively <lb/>
humble office of organist to the borough, having <lb/>
accepted of it in the hope of regaining his health, <lb/>
injured by his ardent and laborious prosecution of <lb/>
the study and practice of musical composition in the <lb/>
metropolis. In childhood, Frances Burney showed a <lb/>
marked backwardness in learning her letters, and <lb/>
even at eight years of age was unable to read. <lb/>
But, though common onlookers called her in <reg orig="con-|sequence">consequence</reg> <lb/>
'the little dunce,' an undercurrent of <lb/>
shrewd observation and lively invention <reg orig="occasion-|ally">occasionally</reg> <lb/>
gleamed through her natural shyness, which led <lb/>
her intelligent mother to stand out against the <lb/>
general opinion, and to say frequently that 'she had <lb/>
no fear about Fanny.' When with her young <reg orig="com-|panions">companions</reg>, <lb/>
and unembarrassed by the presence of <lb/>
strangers, the child would at times display her latent <lb/>
powers of imagination, by imitating such actors as <lb/>
she chanced to have seen, and composing long <lb/>
speeches for them; or she would get up dramatic <lb/>
<pb n="186" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0199"/>
scenes purely of her own invention. Many readers <lb/>
will remember that another lady of distinguished <lb/>
literary talent, Miss Landon, first showed her <lb/>
abilities by similar exercises of the fancy among the <lb/>
playmates of her youth.</p>
<p>In the year 1760, Dr Burney returned to London <lb/>
with invigorated health, and renewed the <reg orig="acquaint-|ance">acquaintance</reg> <lb/>
which he had previously formed with many of <lb/>
the eminent literary men of the age. His daughter <lb/>
Fanny, who at length, at the age of ten, acquired the <lb/>
arts of reading and writing, was soon able to make <lb/>
sharp and shrewd observations on the scenes around <lb/>
her. It is remarkable that she showed a turn for <lb/>
scribbling some years before she began to read with <lb/>
any great diligence, proving that her perceptive <lb/>
faculties were naturally acute in no ordinary degree, <lb/>
while that reflective turn of mind which finds its <lb/>
chief food in books did not so markedly characterise <lb/>
her. As circumstances fell out, she was left in a <lb/>
great measure to educate herself. Her mother died <lb/>
soon after the family removed from Norfolk to <lb/>
London; and when Esther and Susan, her elder and <lb/>
younger sisters, were sent for two years to a Parisian <lb/>
school, Dr Burney did not deem it right that his <lb/>
second daughter should go with them, because she <lb/>
displayed so much affection for her maternal <reg orig="grand-|mother">grandmother</reg>, <lb/>
a Roman Catholic, that he was afraid of her <lb/>
there becoming attached to the religion of that <lb/>
beloved relative. Frances remained at home, <reg orig="accord-|ingly">accordingly</reg>, <lb/>
and was left in a great measure to her own <lb/>
exertions for self-improvement. Her chief spur lay <lb/>
in her unbounded love for her father, who, though <lb/>
he could not spare time to superintend her <reg orig="educa-|tional">educational</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="187" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0200"/>
pursuits, was yet able to give hints which <lb/>
were of great service, these being always regarded <lb/>
by his daughter as laws. As her sister Susan well <lb/>
remarked, on her return from Paris, 'sense, <reg orig="sensi-|bility">sensibility</reg>, <lb/>
bashfulness &lpar;diffidence before society&rpar;, and <lb/>
even a degree of prudery,' became the chief <reg orig="char-|acteristics">characteristics</reg> <lb/>
of Frances Burney, under the course of <lb/>
training described.</p>
<p>Society was, in many respects, the main school in <lb/>
which Miss Frances Burney's observant powers found <lb/>
the means of development. Her father, who took <lb/>
for his second wife a lady of great merit and <lb/>
amiability, was so highly esteemed as to gather <lb/>
around him a circle of friends, whose intimacy could <lb/>
not but be most improving to his children, and <lb/>
among whom may be mentioned David Garrick, Dr <lb/>
Hawkesworth, the poets Armstrong and Mason, Sir <lb/>
Robert Strange, and Barry the painter. Dr Burney <lb/>
also numbered Samuel Johnson and the Thrales <lb/>
among his friends. The mind of Miss Burney was <lb/>
not idle while mixing in the society of these and <lb/>
other parties, and she continued secretly and <reg orig="per-|severingly">perseveringly</reg> <lb/>
to expend her whole leisure time in <lb/>
writing tales and such-like short pieces, her sister <lb/>
Susan being her sole confidant in this employment. <lb/>
But her step-mother began to suspect the truth, <lb/>
and took occasion so seriously, though without any <lb/>
direct personal application, to condemn the scribbling <lb/>
mania in young women, that the poor incipient <lb/>
authoress, at the call of duty, made a bonfire of her <lb/>
compositions, her sister Susan standing weeping by <lb/>
all the while. But the propensity to stain paper is <lb/>
not so easily repressed, and Miss Burney, after her <lb/>
<pb n="188" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0201"/>
pen had for a time lain dormant, though her brain <lb/>
remained busy with the task of composition, set <lb/>
down on paper the story of <hi rend="italic">Evelina, or a Young <lb/>
Lady's Introduction to the World</hi>. She completed at <lb/>
first only the first two of the four volumes, and with <lb/>
great secrecy, her pursuance of such a task being <lb/>
known but to her brother and sisters. An <reg orig="applica-|tion">application</reg> <lb/>
was then made to Dodsley, and afterwards to <lb/>
Lowndes, the publishers, and the latter undertook to <lb/>
issue it when finished. Before that time, however, <lb/>
Miss Burney deemed it right to tell her father of the <lb/>
matter. 'Seizing, therefore, an opportunity when <lb/>
her father was bidding her a kind farewell, <reg orig="pre-|paratory">preparatory</reg> <lb/>
to a Chesington visit, she avowed to him, <lb/>
with many blushes, "her secret little work, and her <lb/>
odd inclination to see it in print;" adding, that her <lb/>
brother Charles would transact the affair with a <lb/>
bookseller at a distance, so that her name could <lb/>
never transpire, and only entreating that he would <lb/>
not himself ask to see the manuscript. "His <reg orig="amaze-|ment">amazement</reg> <lb/>
was even surpassed by his amusement; and <lb/>
his laugh was so gay, that, revived by its cheering <lb/>
sound, she lost all her fears and embarrassment, and <lb/>
heartily joined in it, though somewhat at the expense <lb/>
of her new author-like dignity." Dr Burney thought <lb/>
her project as innocent as it was whimsical; and <lb/>
kindly embracing her, enjoined her to be careful in <lb/>
guarding her own <hi rend="italic">incognita</hi>, and then dropped the <lb/>
subject without even asking the name of her <lb/>
book.'</p>
<p>A diary, commenced after the publication of <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Evelina</hi> in January 1778, informs us minutely of <lb/>
the feelings of the authoress, when her novel met <lb/>
<pb n="189" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0202"/>
decisively with the approbation of the world. There <lb/>
is something very pleasing in her expressions of <lb/>
delight when she records the praises of her beloved <lb/>
father. He declared it to be one of the best novels <lb/>
which he knew; and in reality the work was a <lb/>
wonderful effort for a young lady of her age, and <lb/>
showed humour and fluency, with a lively <reg orig="descrip-|tion">description</reg> <lb/>
of the manners of the period. But though the <lb/>
account of Miss Burney's feelings, when informed of <lb/>
the approval of her father, is sufficiently pleasing, <lb/>
we must say that even the youth of the writer, and <lb/>
the intended confinement of her diary to the eyes of <lb/>
her sisters, cannot make us look with toleration on <lb/>
all the blushings and flushings set down relative <lb/>
to Miss Burney's state of authorship in the diary. <lb/>
Dr Johnson, with whom, as well as with Mrs Thrale, <lb/>
Miss Burney became very intimate, is reported to <lb/>
have said, 'I am too proud now to eat &lpar;of mutton&rpar;; <lb/>
sitting by Miss Burney makes me very proud to-day.' <lb/>
Turn over a leaf of the diary, and the doctor, <reg orig="allud-|ing">alluding</reg> <lb/>
to a lady having called for a pint of ale, says, <lb/>
'Madame Duval could not have done a grosser <lb/>
thing.' Madame Duval being a character in <hi rend="italic">Evelina,</hi> <lb/>
our authoress here writes: 'Oh, how everybody <lb/>
laughed! and to be sure I did not glow at all, <lb/>
nor munch fast, nor look on my plate, nor lose any <lb/>
part of my usual composure!' Sometimes Miss <lb/>
Burney punished her vanity by these affectations. <lb/>
For example, 'a gentleman,' says she, 'inquiring for <lb/>
my father, was asked into the parlour. The then <lb/>
inhabitants were only my mother and me. In <lb/>
entered a square old gentleman, well-wigged, formal, <lb/>
grave, and important. He seated himself. My <lb/>
<pb n="190" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0203"/>
mother asked if he had any message for my father? <lb/>
"No, none." Then he regarded me with a certain <lb/>
dry kind of attention for some time; after which, <lb/>
turning suddenly to my mother, he demanded, "Pray, <lb/>
ma'am, is this your daughter?" "Yes, sir." "Oh! <lb/>
this is Evelina, is it?" "No, sir," cried I, staring at <lb/>
him, and glad none of you were in the way to say <lb/>
Yes. "No?" repeated he, incredulous; "is not your <lb/>
name Evelina, ma'am?" "Dear, no, sir," again <lb/>
quoth I, staring harder. "Ma'am," cried he, drily, <lb/>
"I beg your pardon! I had understood your name <lb/>
was Evelina." And soon after, he went away. <lb/>
When he put down his card, who should it prove but <lb/>
Dr Franklin!' Miss Burney would have liked well <lb/>
enough to be personally known to Dr Franklin as <lb/>
the authoress of <hi rend="italic">Evelina</hi>.</p>
<p>Betwixt 1778 and 1786, at which latter period a <lb/>
great change took place in Miss Burney's situation <lb/>
by her becoming Mistress of the Robes to Queen <lb/>
Charlotte, the authoress of <hi rend="italic">Evelina</hi> added the novel <lb/>
of <hi rend="italic">Cecilia</hi> to the number of her works, and sustained <lb/>
her credit by it in the literary world. Her time in <lb/>
the interval was spent chiefly in literary society, and <lb/>
the most interesting parts of the diary refer to <lb/>
Samuel Johnson, Mrs Thrale, Burke, Seward, and <lb/>
Boswell. A specimen of her anecdotes may be <lb/>
here given; and firstly, let us give a sample of <lb/>
Dr Johnson's domineering disposition, and the way <lb/>
in which he made all bow to him. 'Mrs Burney <lb/>
had on a very pretty linen jacket and coat, <lb/>
and was going to church; but Dr Johnson, who, <lb/>
I suppose, did not like her in a jacket, saw <lb/>
something was the matter, and so found fault <lb/>
<pb n="191" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0204"/>
with the linen; and he looked and peered, and <lb/>
then said, "Why, madam, this won't do! you must <lb/>
not go to church so!" So away went poor Mrs <lb/>
Burney and changed her gown! And when she had <lb/>
done so, he did not like it, but he did not know why; <lb/>
so he told her she should not wear a black hat and <lb/>
cloak in summer. Oh, how he did bother poor Mrs <lb/>
Burney; and himself too, for if the things had been <lb/>
put on to his mind, he would have taken no notice of <lb/>
them.' Again, for the other side of the picture. <lb/>
'At tea-time the subject turned upon the domestic <lb/>
economy of Dr Johnson's own household. Mrs <lb/>
Thrale has often acquainted me that his house is <lb/>
quite filled and overrun with all sorts of strange <lb/>
creatures, whom he admits for mere charity, and <lb/>
because nobody else will admit them&mdash;for his charity <lb/>
is unbounded, or, rather, bounded only by his <reg orig="cir-|cumstances">circumstances</reg>. <lb/>
Mrs Thrale&mdash;"And pray, who is clerk <lb/>
of your kitchen, sir?" Dr Johnson&mdash;"Why, madam, <lb/>
I am afraid there is none; a general anarchy <reg orig="pre-|vails">prevails</reg> <lb/>
in my kitchen, as I am told by Mr Levat, who <lb/>
says it is not now what it used to be!" "Mr Levat, <lb/>
I suppose, sir, has the office of keeping the hospital <lb/>
in health; for he is an apothecary." "Levat, <lb/>
madam, is a brutal fellow, but I have a good regard <lb/>
for him; for his brutality is in his manners, not his <lb/>
mind." "But pray, sir, who is the Poll you talk of? <lb/>
She that you used to abet in her quarrels with Mrs <lb/>
Williams, and call out, "At her again, Poll! Never <lb/>
flinch, Poll!" "Why, I took to Poll very well at <lb/>
first, but she won't do upon a nearer examination." <lb/>
"How came she among you, sir?" "Why, I don't <lb/>
rightly remember, but we could spare her very well <lb/>
<pb n="192" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0205"/>
from us. Poll is a stupid slut; I had some hopes of <lb/>
her at first; but when I talked to her tightly and <lb/>
closely, I could make nothing of her; she was <lb/>
wiggle-waggle, and I could never persuade her to be <lb/>
categorical. I wish Miss Burney would come among <lb/>
us; if she would only give us a week, we should <lb/>
furnish her with ample materials for a new scene in <lb/>
her next work."'</p>
<p>Miss Burney began her attendance on Queen <lb/>
Charlotte in 1786. Kind though George III. and <lb/>
Queen Charlotte ever were to her, the situation of <lb/>
Mistress of the Royal Robes was rendered very <reg orig="dis-|agreeable">disagreeable</reg> <lb/>
by the German women about the queen, <lb/>
and, above all, by the stiff etiquette practised at <lb/>
court. Our space will not permit us to enter on <lb/>
the scenes which Miss Burney witnessed in her court <lb/>
place, but we may point attention to these as among <lb/>
the most amusing things in her journal. We learn <lb/>
from them that the system of rigid, unbending <lb/>
ceremony prevalent in palaces, which wearies out the <lb/>
souls and bodies alike of the chamber-grooms and <lb/>
other attendants, is not less fatiguing, in reality, to <lb/>
the royal parties in whose honour it is maintained, <lb/>
and that their lives are but one long yawn. Such, <lb/>
at least, was the case with the third George and his <lb/>
queen; and such must ever be most especially the <lb/>
case where the royal personages, like them, are good <lb/>
dull folks, of exemplary life.</p>
<p>At the end of five years, Miss Burney's spirits and <lb/>
health fairly sunk under her 'honourable' office, and <lb/>
she was forced to quit it. Shortly afterwards, she <lb/>
became acquainted with Count Alexander Piochard <lb/>
D'Arblay, an emigrant artillery officer of France, and <lb/>
<pb n="193" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0206"/>
an attachment took place, which terminated in their <lb/>
union in 1793. Led by this event to take an interest <lb/>
in the French refugees, she drew up some <hi rend="italic">Reflections <lb/>
relative to the Emigrant Clergy of France</hi>, and <lb/>
published the essay for their benefit. Another <reg orig="pro-|duction">production</reg> <lb/>
from her pen was a tragedy entitled <hi rend="italic">Edwy <lb/>
and Elgiva</hi>, produced at Drury Lane in 1795. It <lb/>
attracted no attention, though her ordinary style of <lb/>
literary composition was most certainly dramatic in <lb/>
no ordinary degree, as her novels and memoirs prove <lb/>
beyond question. So obvious was this quality of her <lb/>
genius, indeed, that Sheridan and others had long <lb/>
before endeavoured to direct her attention to the <lb/>
stage. Some incomplete pieces, however, were the <lb/>
only result. Her reputation as the first novelist of <lb/>
the time seems not to have been affected by the <lb/>
mediocre success of her tragedy, since, in 1796, a <lb/>
new novel from her pen, styled <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi>, received <lb/>
subscriptions to the amount of <hi rend="italic">three thousand <lb/>
guineas</hi>. When we consider that she got but twenty <lb/>
pounds for <hi rend="italic">Evelina</hi>, a novel of far greater merit, the <lb/>
dependence of literary earnings upon the repute of <lb/>
the author becomes strikingly apparent. With the <lb/>
proceeds from her novel, which her husband's position <lb/>
rendered not unimportant, Madame D'Arblay built <lb/>
a neat villa or hermitage, which she called 'Camilla <lb/>
Cottage,' and in which she spent her days in quiet, <lb/>
until the peace of 1802 attracted her husband to <lb/>
Paris. Madame D'Arblay accompanied him, and, <lb/>
contrary to intention, found herself obliged to remain <lb/>
there, M. D'Arblay having been led to form <reg orig="con-|nections">connections</reg> <lb/>
with Napoleon which he afterwards could <lb/>
not in honour retract from. The Russian campaign <lb/>
<pb n="194" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0207"/>
of 1812 gave the subject of our memoir an <reg orig="oppor-|tunity">opportunity</reg> <lb/>
of returning to England, where her husband <lb/>
joined her, and remained till the close of his life <lb/>
in 1818.</p>
<p>Two additional works, <hi rend="italic">The Wanderer</hi>, a novel <lb/>
published in 1814, and <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of Dr Burney</hi>, <lb/>
issued in 1832, were the fruit of Madame D'Arblay's <lb/>
leisure hours, subsequently to her return to England. <lb/>
For the first of these works she received &pound;1500, <lb/>
though it was less esteemed, and, indeed, possessed <lb/>
much less merit, than any of her earlier novels: the <lb/>
last of them, though marked by blemishes similar <lb/>
to those of her posthumously published <hi rend="italic">Diary</hi>, and <lb/>
bearing some tokens, moreover, of the natural decline <lb/>
of the author's powers, contains many interesting <lb/>
anecdotes relative to the eminent parties with whom <lb/>
Dr Burney associated. For some years after her <lb/>
return to England, Madame D'Arblay had the <lb/>
pleasure of witnessing the high estimation in which <lb/>
her brothers, Admiral James Burney, and Dr Charles <lb/>
Burney, the celebrated Greek scholar, were held; and <lb/>
she also enjoyed the society of her son, the Rev. <lb/>
Alexander D'Arblay, curate of Camden Town Chapel. <lb/>
He died, however, in 1837, and his mother did not <lb/>
long survive him. She breathed her last at Bath, on <lb/>
the 6th of January 1840, in her eighty-eighth year.</p>
<p>Madame D'Arblay was almost the last, if not the <lb/>
very last, surviving link betwixt the present age of <lb/>
literature and that of Johnson and Goldsmith. She <lb/>
was undoubtedly a woman of fine talents, and her <lb/>
novels of <hi rend="italic">Evelina</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Cecilia</hi> are among the few of <lb/>
the old school which reward perusal and merit <reg orig="pre-|servation">preservation</reg>.</p>

<figure id="f35" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0210" rend="block"/>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Mrs lucy hutchinson</hi> was the daughter <lb/>
of Sir Allen Apsley, Lieutenant of the Tower <lb/>
of London during the reign of Charles I. <lb/>
In a memoir of her husband, written by her, and <lb/>
which is one of the most pleasing biographies in the <lb/>
English language, she praises highly the integrity, <lb/>
benevolence, and mutual affection of her parents. <lb/>
Her father had a very decided dislike for those gay <lb/>
young gentlemen who merely know how to make <lb/>
themselves pleasant to the ladies and study the <lb/>
fashion of their dress; he considered usefulness and <lb/>
learning as the true tests of respectability. From <lb/>
these intelligent, judicious, and thoroughly well-bred <lb/>
parents, Lucy Apsley probably derived the sedate and <lb/>
somewhat matronly character by which she was early <lb/>
distinguished. At four years old, she read perfectly <lb/>
well; and her memory was so great, that she could <lb/>
repeat almost exactly the sermons she heard. At <lb/>
seven years of age, she had eight tutors, in languages, <lb/>
music, dancing, writing, and needlework; but study <lb/>
was the only thing she really loved; and she pursued <lb/>
it with a degree of eagerness that threatened to be <lb/>
prejudicial to her health. In Latin, she outstripped <lb/>
her brothers, although they were very clever, and <lb/>
<pb n="198" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0211"/>
exceedingly industrious. For female employments <lb/>
and elegant accomplishments she had less taste than <lb/>
her mother wished; and she held the usual sports of <lb/>
children in great contempt. She says, 'When I was <lb/>
obliged to entertain such children as came to visit <lb/>
me, I tired them with more grave instructions than <lb/>
their mothers, and plucked all their babies to pieces, <lb/>
and kept them in such awe, that they were glad <lb/>
when I entertained myself with older company.'</p>
<p>Colonel John Hutchinson, whom this young lady <lb/>
afterwards married, was the son of Sir Thomas <reg orig="Hut-|chinson">Hutchinson</reg>, <lb/>
and Lady Margaret, daughter of Sir John <lb/>
Byron of Newstead, one of the ancestors of Lord <lb/>
Byron, the poet. He is represented as a gentleman <lb/>
of graceful person, highly cultivated mind, and very <lb/>
prepossessing manners; and as he was the eldest <lb/>
surviving son of his father, he was a match alike <lb/>
desirable to mothers and daughters. He passed <lb/>
through the usual routine of education prescribed for <lb/>
gentlemen of that period, and was distinguished for <lb/>
his literary attainments, his skill in active and <lb/>
graceful exercises, and his very correct taste in <lb/>
music. Soon after he left the university, he <reg orig="deter-|mined">determined</reg> <lb/>
to travel in France; and as some delay <lb/>
occurred in forming the necessary arrangements, he <lb/>
was advised to make a short visit to Richmond, <lb/>
where the prince at that time held his court. <lb/>
Crowds of gay company were of course attracted to <lb/>
the place, and a young gentleman of Mr Hutchinson's <lb/>
pretensions received abundant attentions from the <lb/>
wealthy, the witty, and the beautiful.</p>
<p>One day, when there was a great deal of company <lb/>
at the house, some one sung a song, which was much <lb/>
<pb n="199" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0212"/>
admired. A gentleman present observed that it <lb/>
was written by a lady in the neighbourhood. Mr <lb/>
Hutchinson, fancying something of rationality in <lb/>
the sonnet, said he could scarcely believe it was a <lb/>
woman's. The gentleman asserted that the verses <lb/>
were written by Miss Lucy Apsley, and being a <lb/>
great admirer of the author, he was very enthusiastic <lb/>
in her praises. Upon this, Mr Hutchinson said, 'I <lb/>
cannot rest until this lady returns. I must be <lb/>
acquainted with her.' His informant replied, 'You <lb/>
must not expect that, sir. She will not be <lb/>
acquainted with gentlemen. However this song may <lb/>
have stolen forth, she is extremely unwilling to <lb/>
have her perfections known. She lives only in the <lb/>
enjoyment of herself, and has not the humanity to <lb/>
communicate that happiness to any of our sex.'</p>
<p>The information of this reserved humour pleased <lb/>
Mr Hutchinson more than all he had heard, and his <lb/>
thoughts became completely occupied with the hope <lb/>
of seeing her. At last, news was brought that Mrs <lb/>
Apsley and her daughter would return in a few days. <lb/>
The messenger had some bride laces in his pocket, <lb/>
and, for the sake of fun, he allowed the company to <lb/>
suppose the young lady was married. Mr <reg orig="Hutchin-|son">Hutchinson</reg> <lb/>
became very pale, and was obliged to leave the <lb/>
room. He began to think there was magic in the <lb/>
place, which enchanted men out of their right senses. <lb/>
The next day, it was ascertained that the tidings of <lb/>
her marriage was a mere hoax; and as soon as she <lb/>
arrived, Mr Hutchinson, under the pretence of <reg orig="escort-|ing">escorting</reg> <lb/>
her little sister, went to her father's house, and <lb/>
obtained a sight of the being who had so much <lb/>
occupied his thoughts. Judging from the engraved <lb/>
<pb n="200" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0213"/>
portrait of Mrs Hutchinson, she must have been <lb/>
eminently beautiful. At all events, the eager lover <lb/>
was not disappointed in her appearance; and she at <lb/>
first sight was surprised with an unusual liking for <lb/>
a gentleman whose countenance and graceful mien <lb/>
promised an extraordinary person.</p>
<p>At their first interview, there was something of <lb/>
melancholy negligence about her; for her parents, <lb/>
displeased that she had refused several advantageous <lb/>
offers, had urged her to a marriage for which her <lb/>
heart had no inclination. From a sense of duty, she <lb/>
tried to bring her feelings to their wishes, but was <lb/>
finally obliged to confess that she could not, without <lb/>
destruction to her happiness. Mr Hutchinson, being <lb/>
informed of these circumstances, and finding her <lb/>
willing to encourage his acquaintance, believed that <lb/>
the same secret power had given them a mutual <lb/>
inclination for each other. He visited her father's <lb/>
house daily, and it was not long before they had <lb/>
agreed to become man and wife.</p>
<p>The day that the friends on both sides met to <lb/>
conclude the marriage, she fell ill of smallpox; <lb/>
her life was in desperate hazard, and for a long time <lb/>
the disease made her the most deformed person that <lb/>
could be seen; yet he was nothing troubled about it, <lb/>
but married her as soon as she was able to quit the <lb/>
chamber, when the priest and all that saw her were <lb/>
affrighted to look on her; but his justice and <reg orig="con-|stancy">constancy</reg> <lb/>
were recompensed by her entire recovery. <lb/>
One thing is worthy of imitation in him; though he <lb/>
had as strong an affection for her as ever man had, <lb/>
he did not declare it till he had first acquainted his <lb/>
father; and after that he would make no <reg orig="engage-|ment">engagement</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="201" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0214"/>
but what his love and honour bound him in, <lb/>
wherein he was more firm than all the oaths in the <lb/>
world could have made him, notwithstanding many <lb/>
powerful temptations of wealth and beauty; for his <lb/>
father, before he knew his son's inclinations, had <lb/>
concluded another treaty for him, much more <reg orig="advan-|tageous">advantageous</reg> <lb/>
to his family, and worthy of his liking. The <lb/>
parent was as honourably indulgent to his affection <lb/>
as the son was strict in the observance of his duty; <lb/>
and at length, after about fourteen months' various <lb/>
exercise of his mind in the pursuit, the marriage was <lb/>
accomplished to the full content of all.</p>
<p>For two years after this union, Mr Hutchinson <lb/>
enjoyed the dignified retirement of an English <lb/>
country gentleman; and as religious controversy at <lb/>
that time interested the whole nation, the study of <lb/>
theology was largely mingled with his literary <reg orig="pur-|suits">pursuits</reg>. <lb/>
At first they resided about ten miles from <lb/>
London, to which Mrs Hutchinson's habits and early <lb/>
associations rendered her extremely attached. But <lb/>
their two eldest sons were twins; and as the family <lb/>
increased rapidly, it was deemed expedient to remove <lb/>
to a cheaper part of the country. They therefore <lb/>
retired to his estate at Owthorpe, Nottinghamshire. <lb/>
Here they had not long remained before the discord <lb/>
of civil war, which had long been heard in the <lb/>
distance, sounded its fearful alarm through the land. <lb/>
The dreadful massacres in Ireland in 1641 aroused Mr <lb/>
Hutchinson to the state of public affairs. He entered <lb/>
warmly into the disputes existing between the king <lb/>
and parliament; but while he zealously maintained <lb/>
the pretensions of the latter, he had an earnest desire <lb/>
that bloodshed should be avoided, if possible.</p>
<pb n="202" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0215"/>
<p>The open demonstration of his political opinions, <lb/>
of course, made him an object of suspicion to the <lb/>
royalists, and various attempts were made to seize <lb/>
his person. When the parliament collected forces <lb/>
under the command of Lord Essex, he joined the <lb/>
army; and having resolved to defend the town and <lb/>
castle of Nottingham against the king's troops, he <lb/>
was chosen governor of that place. His wife followed <lb/>
him, sharing all his counsels and his dangers.</p>
<p>In addition to the difficulties with which Mrs <lb/>
Hutchinson was here surrounded, it happened, amid <lb/>
the inevitable horrors of civil war, that her brother, <lb/>
Sir Allen Apsley, commanded a troop of horse in the <lb/>
king's service, and was frequently on duty in the <lb/>
same part of the country where her husband was <lb/>
fighting for the parliament. It is, however, to the <lb/>
honour of the English people that this civil contest <lb/>
was carried on for years with few instances of <lb/>
personal violence. The Puritan colonel lived on very <lb/>
cordial terms with his Cavalier brother in-law. <reg orig="Pro-|tected">Protected</reg> <lb/>
by mutual passes, they often visited each other, <lb/>
and exchanged various civilities, without any attempt <lb/>
on either side to persuade the other from the <reg orig="per-|formance">performance</reg> <lb/>
of what he considered his duty. During <lb/>
this trying period, when her husband was endangered <lb/>
by treachery within the castle, and warfare without, <lb/>
Mrs Hutchinson behaved most admirably. Shut up <lb/>
with him in the garrison, she enlivened him by her <lb/>
cheerful fortitude, soothed him with her tenderness, <lb/>
and assisted him by her advice. Her heroism and <lb/>
energy encouraged the troops; and she herself <lb/>
attended upon the sick, and dressed the wounds of <lb/>
the sufferers, both captives and conquerors. Her <lb/>
<pb n="203" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0216"/>
eldest daughter died in Nottingham Castle, being a <lb/>
weakly child, in consequence of the fatigue and <lb/>
anxiety her mother had undergone.</p>
<p>Colonel Hutchinson remained in this garrison until <lb/>
the close of the war; at which time his health was <lb/>
much impaired by the hardships to which he had <lb/>
been exposed. He was afterwards returned to <lb/>
parliament for the town which he had so bravely <lb/>
defended, and being appointed a member of the <lb/>
High Court of Justice for the trial of the king, he <lb/>
considered it his duty to concur in the sentence of <lb/>
condemnation against the unfortunate Charles I. <lb/>
After the Restoration, his punishment was limited <lb/>
to a discharge from parliament, and from all offices, <lb/>
civil and military, for ever. Returning to Owthorpe, <lb/>
he spent nearly a year in the enjoyment of his <lb/>
quiet and tasteful pursuits. But Charles II. was <lb/>
not disposed to trust the loyalty of those who had <lb/>
beheaded his father. Colonel Hutchinson was seized, <lb/>
upon suspicion of being concerned in a <reg orig="treason-|able">treasonable</reg> <lb/>
plot, and was conveyed by an armed guard to <lb/>
London, his wife, with their eldest son and daughter, <lb/>
accompanying him. The prisoner was committed to <lb/>
the Tower, and treated with great harshness. For <lb/>
several weeks his wife was not permitted to visit <lb/>
him; but she would not rest until her earnest <lb/>
prayers, aided by the powerful intercession of her <lb/>
brother, were granted. It was her wish to take <lb/>
lodgings in the Tower, but this was refused. She <lb/>
was obliged, in the depth of winter, to walk from <lb/>
her residence every day to dinner, and back again at <lb/>
night. This was a forlorn kind of existence, but the <lb/>
colonel endured it with perfect content and <reg orig="cheerful-|ness">cheerfulness</reg>. <lb/>
<pb n="204" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0217"/>
His wife bore all her own toils joyfully for the <lb/>
love of him, but could not be otherwise than very <lb/>
sad at the sight of his undeserved sufferings. He <lb/>
would very sweetly and kindly chide her for it, and <lb/>
tell her if she were but cheerful, he should think this <lb/>
suffering the happiest thing that ever befell him.</p>
<p>Although no formal accusation was ever brought <lb/>
against Colonel Hutchinson, and no evidence specified <lb/>
as the ground of his detention, he was imprisoned in <lb/>
the Tower ten months. His energetic and <reg orig="affection-|ate">affectionate</reg> <lb/>
wife laboured without ceasing for his deliverance, <lb/>
and his oppressors often found themselves <reg orig="embar-|rassed">embarrassed</reg> <lb/>
and confounded by her eloquent arguments. <lb/>
But the most urgent solicitations, aided by all the <lb/>
powerful intercession she could procure, were of no <lb/>
avail. He was suddenly removed from the Tower <lb/>
to Sandown Castle, in Kent, where he was confined <lb/>
in a very damp unwholesome apartment, with another <lb/>
prisoner of the most vulgar and brutal manners. <lb/>
Here he died on the 11th of September 1664, in the <lb/>
forty-ninth year of his age, after eleven months of <lb/>
severe imprisonment. Four sons and four daughters <lb/>
survived him: and for their edification Mrs <reg orig="Hutchin-|son">Hutchinson</reg> <lb/>
wrote the memoir of her husband. The book <lb/>
might with propriety be called the 'History of Her <lb/>
Own Times;' for it is in fact a very philosophical view <lb/>
of the state of parties in England at that period, and <lb/>
of the causes which produced them. In her brief <lb/>
sketches of public men, she evinces singular <reg orig="discrim-|ination">discrimination</reg> <lb/>
and clearness of mind; and considering how <lb/>
dearly her best affections were united with the <lb/>
interests of one party, her candour and impartiality <lb/>
are remarkable; but so large a portion of the work <lb/>
<pb n="205" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0218"/>
is occupied with details of the petty feuds and <lb/>
factions of the day, that, as a whole, it can be <lb/>
interesting to but few, even of English readers. <lb/>
Her husband is always mentioned with romantic <lb/>
tenderness and deep sensibility. She evidently loved <lb/>
him with her whole soul; and when he was gone, <lb/>
she was a widow indeed. In her later days she <lb/>
is known to have suffered considerably from the <lb/>
ruin of her husband's fortunes and patrimony. How <lb/>
long she survived her husband is not exactly known. <lb/>
The <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of the Life of Colonel Hutchinson</hi>, by <lb/>
Mrs Hutchinson, first appeared in 1806, and have <lb/>
been frequently reprinted.</p>
<p>Mrs Hutchinson was possessed of talent and <reg orig="learn-|ing">learning</reg> <lb/>
that would have given her a high reputation in <lb/>
any age, and which were very extraordinary in a <lb/>
lady of that period; yet she performed all the duties <lb/>
of a woman in a most exemplary manner. The <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi> pays the following tribute to her <lb/>
memory: 'Education is certainly far more generally <lb/>
diffused in our days, and accomplishments infinitely <lb/>
more common; but the perusal of this volume has <lb/>
taught us to doubt whether the better sort of women <lb/>
were not fashioned of old by a purer and more <lb/>
exalted standard; and whether the most eminent <lb/>
female of the present day would not appear to <lb/>
disadvantage by the side of Mrs Hutchinson. There <lb/>
is something in the domestic virtue and calm <reg orig="com-|manding">commanding</reg> <lb/>
mind of this English matron, that makes <lb/>
the Corinnes and Heloises appear very insignificant. <lb/>
We may safely venture to assert, that a nation which <lb/>
produces many such wives and mothers as Mrs Lucy <lb/>
Hutchinson, must be both great and happy.'</p>

<head><hi rend="bold">LADY RACHEL RUSSELL.</hi></head>
<figure id="f36" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0219" rend="block"/>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">This</hi> illustrious woman was the second <lb/>
daughter of Thomas Wriothesley, Earl of <lb/>
Southampton, by his first wife, Rachel <lb/>
de Ruvigny, a lady of an ancient and <reg orig="distin-|guished">distinguished</reg> <lb/>
Protestant family in France. The subject <lb/>
of our memoir was born in the year 1636, and <lb/>
in her infancy had the misfortune to lose her <lb/>
mother; a loss, however, which was in a great <lb/>
measure compensated by the care of an upright <lb/>
and excellent father, who, amid all the labours <lb/>
attendant on a high official situation at court, <lb/>
found time to instil the principles of religion and <lb/>
rectitude into the minds of his children. In Lady <lb/>
Rachel, they were implanted in a soil congenial <lb/>
with every noble sentiment, both of the heart and <lb/>
intellect.</p>
<p>The incidents in Lady Russell's early life are <lb/>
few. In those days, alliances among the noble and <lb/>
wealthy were dictated by the monarch or the <lb/>
parents; and with the parties chiefly concerned, <lb/>
it was, as our heroine expressed herself at a <reg orig="sub-|sequent">subsequent</reg> <lb/>
period, 'acceptance rather than choosing on <lb/>
either side.' Lord Vaughan, son of the Earl of <lb/>
Carbery, was the person to whom the hand of Lady <lb/>
<pb n="207" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0220"/>
Rachel, at the age of seventeen, was given; and <lb/>
from all that is known of this union, it appears to <lb/>
have been attended with a moderate share of <reg orig="happi-|ness">happiness</reg> <lb/>
while it lasted. One child, which died shortly <lb/>
after birth, was the only fruit of this marriage, <lb/>
which was dissolved by the decease of Lord Vaughan, <lb/>
little more than three years after its solemnisation.</p>
<p>It is probable that the meeting of the widowed <lb/>
Lady Vaughan with her second husband took place, <lb/>
while she resided with her elder sister at Titchfield, <lb/>
a seat inherited from their father, Lord Southampton, <lb/>
then recently deceased. Mr William Russell, as he <lb/>
was called during his elder brother's life, was second <lb/>
son of William, Earl of Bedford; and having, like all <lb/>
younger brothers in Britain, no great fortune, either <lb/>
in reality or in expectancy, the worldly advantages <lb/>
in a connection with Lady Vaughan lay all on his <lb/>
side, since her father's death had made her a <reg orig="con-|siderable">considerable</reg> <lb/>
heiress. She was, however, entirely her <lb/>
own mistress; and as soon as the mutual sentiments <lb/>
of Mr Russell and herself were discovered, they were <lb/>
united to each other. This marriage, which lasted <lb/>
through fourteen years of such happiness as rarely <lb/>
falls to the lot of human beings, took place in the <lb/>
end of the year 1672. Fortunately, a blow like the <lb/>
one which destroyed that happiness is not less rare <lb/>
in its occurrence.</p>
<p>The man with whose fate Lady Rachel had now <lb/>
bound up her own, was one whose career, in its <reg orig="pro-|gress">progress</reg> <lb/>
and end, constitutes an era in the history of his <lb/>
country. Heir, as he became, some time after his <lb/>
marriage, to one of the wealthiest and noblest <lb/>
families of Britain, Lord William Russell was <reg orig="fore-|most">foremost</reg>, <lb/>
<pb n="208" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0221"/>
to use the words of a descendant, 'in <reg orig="defend-|ing">defending</reg> <lb/>
the rights of the people. Busily occupied in the <lb/>
affairs of public life, he was, at the same time, <lb/>
revered in his own family as the best of husbands <lb/>
and of fathers; he joined the truest sense of religion <lb/>
with unqualified assertion of freedom; and, after <lb/>
an honest perseverance in a good cause, at length <lb/>
attested, on the scaffold, his attachment to the <lb/>
ancient principles of the constitution of his country.' <lb/>
Such was the being on whom the hand and heart <lb/>
of Lady Rachel were bestowed; and keeping this <lb/>
view of his character in mind, the reader will <reg orig="under-|stand">understand</reg> <lb/>
and appreciate the deep affection, and <reg orig="rever-|ence">reverence</reg> <lb/>
almost, apparent in all the letters of the wife <lb/>
to her husband. With extracts from these we shall <lb/>
continue our narrative.</p>
<p>Absent frequently from his home upon public or <lb/>
parliamentary duties, even in the earliest years of <lb/>
his married life, Lord Russell gave frequent <reg orig="oppor-|tunity">opportunity</reg> <lb/>
for the correspondence of his lady; and these <lb/>
letters being fortunately preserved, the world has <lb/>
received such an example of woman's love as no <lb/>
other record can show. Three years after their <lb/>
union, Lady Russell thus writes: 'If I were more <lb/>
fortunate in my expression, I could do myself more <lb/>
right when I would own to my dearest husband <lb/>
what real and perfect happiness I enjoy, from that <lb/>
kindness he allows me every day to receive new <lb/>
marks of.&hellip; But, my best life, you that know so <lb/>
well how to love and oblige, make my felicity entire, <lb/>
by believing my heart possessed with all the <reg orig="grati-|tude">gratitude</reg>, <lb/>
honour, and passionate affection to your person, <lb/>
any creature is capable of, or can be obliged to; and <lb/>
<pb n="209" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0222"/>
this granted, what have I to ask but a continuance <lb/>
&lpar;if God see fit&rpar; of these enjoyments? if not, a <reg orig="sub-|mission">submission</reg>, <lb/>
without murmur, to his most wise <reg orig="dispensa-|tions">dispensations</reg> <lb/>
and unerring providence; having a thankful <lb/>
heart for the years I have been so perfectly <reg orig="con-|tented">contented</reg> <lb/>
in.' The passages that follow, in the same <lb/>
letter, are rendered deeply affecting when we think <lb/>
of the events that really befell this pair. '<hi rend="small-caps">He</hi> knows <lb/>
best when we have had enough here; what I most <lb/>
earnestly beg from His mercy is, that we both live <lb/>
so; as, whichever goes first, the other may not <lb/>
sorrow as for one of whom they have no hope. <lb/>
Then let us cheerfully expect to be together to a <lb/>
good old age; if not, let us not doubt but He will <lb/>
support us under what trial He will inflict. These <lb/>
are necessary meditations sometimes, that we may <lb/>
not be surprised above our strength by a sudden <lb/>
accident, being unprepared.' This is indeed the <lb/>
training of heart and mind that makes adversity <lb/>
light.</p>
<p>Lady Russell's letters are the only account we <lb/>
have of the course of her wedded life. After the <lb/>
birth of her children, two daughters, and <reg orig="subse-|quently">subsequently</reg> <lb/>
a son, her correspondence receives, if possible, <lb/>
a shade of deeper interest. Having the prospect of <lb/>
an early meeting with her lord, she says, in a letter <lb/>
of 1675, 'I write this to my dear husband, because I <lb/>
love to be busied either in speaking of him or to <lb/>
him; but the pretence I take is, lest that I wrote <lb/>
yesterday should miscarry..&hellip; It is an <reg orig="inexpres-|sible">inexpressible</reg> <lb/>
joy to consider, I shall see the person I most <lb/>
and only long to be with, before another week is <lb/>
past; I should condemn my sense of this expected <lb/>
<pb n="210" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0223"/>
happiness as weak and pitiful, if I could tell it you. <lb/>
No, my best life, I can say little, but think all you <lb/>
can, and you cannot think too much; my heart <lb/>
makes it all good.' In another she says, 'Your girls <lb/>
are very well. Miss Rachel &lpar;the eldest&rpar; has <lb/>
prattled a long story. She says, papa has sent for <lb/>
her to <hi rend="italic">wobee</hi> &lpar;Woburn, seat of Lord Bedford&rpar;, and <lb/>
then she gallops, and says she has been there, and a <lb/>
great deal more.'</p>
<p>A devoted wife in every respect, Lady Russell <lb/>
watched her husband's public career with the <reg orig="atten-|tive">attentive</reg> <lb/>
eyes of affection. One letter will exhibit this <lb/>
strongly. A motion to inquire into the state of the <lb/>
nation was projected in the Commons, and the court <lb/>
resisted the attempt with anger and alarm. Lady <lb/>
Russell learned that her husband was to be the <lb/>
mover, and in great anxiety wrote a warning note: <lb/>
'My sister being here, tells me she overheard you <lb/>
tell her lord last night that you would take notice of <lb/>
the business &lpar;you know what I mean&rpar; in the House: <lb/>
this alarms me, and I do earnestly beg of you to tell <lb/>
me truly if you have or mean to do it. If you do, I <lb/>
am most assured you will repent it. I beg once <lb/>
more to know the truth. It is more pain to be in <lb/>
doubt &lpar;<hi rend="italic">to me</hi>&rpar;, and to your sister too; and if I have <lb/>
any interest, I use it to beg your silence in this case, <lb/>
at least to-day.' The prudent wife was right. The <lb/>
motion weighed heavily against her husband at a <lb/>
later day; but he saw his duty, and performed it.</p>
<p>Within a few years after the date of these letters, <lb/>
and fourteen years after his marriage, Lord Russell <lb/>
was examined, and committed to the Tower, on a <lb/>
charge of treasonable conspiracy. It is not our <reg orig="busi-|ness">business</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="211" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0224"/>
to investigate into this matter, further than as <lb/>
it illustrates the character of Lady Rachel. Her <lb/>
husband's own saying, long before this event, that <lb/>
'arbitrary government could not be set up in <lb/>
England without wading through his blood,' may <lb/>
explain the feelings with which his lady viewed the <lb/>
proceedings of his enemies. From the hour of his <lb/>
imprisonment, Lord Russell regarded himself as a <lb/>
doomed man. Whatever were the forebodings of <lb/>
his wife, she did not allow herself to sink into the <lb/>
inactivity of despair. Every moment between the <lb/>
imprisonment and trial was spent by Lady Rachel <lb/>
in anxious, yet clear-sighted, preparations for his <lb/>
defence. The following note is the best evidence of <lb/>
her employment at this moment; it was written <lb/>
immediately before the trial: 'Your friends <reg orig="believ-|ing">believing</reg> <lb/>
I can do you some service at your trial, I am <lb/>
extreme willing to try; my resolution will hold out <lb/>
&mdash;pray let yours. But it may be the court will not <lb/>
let me; however, do you let me try. I think, <reg orig="how-|ever">however</reg>, <lb/>
to meet you at Richardson's, and then resolve; <lb/>
your brother Ned will be with me, and sister <lb/>
Marget.'</p>
<p>And at the trial, to the everlasting honour of <lb/>
her sex, the virtuous lady did appear. When her <lb/>
husband, aware of his impending fate, yet willing <lb/>
to use every honourable means to avert it, asked his <lb/>
judges if he might be allowed the services of some <lb/>
one to take notes for the aid of his memory, the <lb/>
reply was, 'Any of your servants shall assist you in <lb/>
writing anything you please.' '<hi rend="italic">My wife</hi> is here, my <lb/>
lord, to do it,' said the accused. A thrill of anguish <lb/>
ran through the whole assembly when the <reg orig="noble-|minded">nobleminded</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="212" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0225"/>
wife rose and took her place by her <lb/>
husband's side. The hard-hearted officials <reg orig="them-|selves">themselves</reg> <lb/>
were affected, and those who had met, at the <lb/>
bidding of a base court, to do an innocent man to <lb/>
death, felt a pang of remorse. The moment is one of <lb/>
the proudest in the records of woman!</p>
<p>What were the feelings of the wife on hearing <lb/>
the fatal sentence of death pronounced against the <lb/>
cherished of her soul, we have no means of knowing. <lb/>
Certain it is, that for <hi rend="italic">his</hi> sake&mdash;that <hi rend="italic">his</hi> composure <lb/>
might not be unbent&mdash;she departed with him from <lb/>
the scene of doom without outward violence of grief. <lb/>
Yet hope did not wholly forsake her; her exertions <lb/>
to obtain a remission of the sentence were <reg orig="indefatig-|able">indefatigable</reg>. <lb/>
Wherever a glimmer of hope shone, that way <lb/>
she tried. She knelt at the feet of the king, and <lb/>
pled for mercy: it was refused to her. When she <lb/>
became convinced that her beloved husband must <lb/>
die, Lady Rachel then sought her lord's presence in <lb/>
his prison, that she might be with him, see and hear <lb/>
him, while he was yet on earth. Bishop Burnet, <lb/>
who attended Lord Russell in his last hours, gives <lb/>
this affecting narration: 'The day before his death <lb/>
he received the sacrament with much devotion, and <lb/>
I preached two short sermons to him, which he heard <lb/>
with great affection, and we were shut up until <lb/>
towards evening. Then Lady Russell brought him <lb/>
his little children that he might take leave of them, <lb/>
in which he maintained his firmness, though he was <lb/>
a fond father. Some few of his friends likewise <lb/>
came to bid him farewell. He spoke to his children <lb/>
in a way suited to their age, and with great <reg orig="cheer-|fulness">cheerfulness</reg>, <lb/>
and took leave of his friends in so calm a <lb/>

LORD WILLIAM RUSSELL.</head>
</figure>
<pb entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0227"/>
<pb n="215" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0228"/>
manner as surprised them all. Lady Russell returned <lb/>
alone in the evening. At eleven o'clock she left him; <lb/>
he kissed her four or five times, and she kept her <lb/>
sorrow so within herself, that she gave him no <reg orig="dis-|turbance">disturbance</reg> <lb/>
at parting. As soon as she was gone, he <lb/>
said to me, "Now the bitterness of death is past," for <lb/>
he loved and esteemed her beyond expression, as she <lb/>
well deserved it in all respects.' The concluding <lb/>
scene of this memorable man's career was ennobled <lb/>
by the calm dignity of conscious innocence.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the strength of Lady Russell's <lb/>
mind, it had nearly sunk under the severity of her <lb/>
affliction. Her letters for some time after her <lb/>
husband's death exhibit her struggling to bend her <lb/>
thoughts to resignation to the will of heaven. 'You <lb/>
that knew us both,' says she to her friend Dr <reg orig="Fitz-|william">Fitzwilliam</reg>, <lb/>
'and how we lived, must allow that I have <lb/>
just cause to bewail my loss. I know it is common <lb/>
with others to lose a friend; but to have lived with <lb/>
such a one, it may be questioned how few can glory <lb/>
in the like happiness, so, consequently, lament the <lb/>
like loss. Who can but shrink from such a <lb/>
blow? &hellip;. Lord, let me understand the reason <lb/>
of these dark and wounding providences, that I <lb/>
sink not under the discouragement of my own <lb/>
thoughts! I know I have deserved my <reg orig="punish-|ment">punishment</reg>, <lb/>
and will be silent under it: yet secretly my <lb/>
heart mourns, too sadly, I fear, and cannot be <reg orig="com-|forted">comforted</reg>, <lb/>
because I have not the dear companion and <lb/>
sharer of all my joys and sorrows. I want him to <lb/>
talk with, to walk with, to eat and sleep with. <lb/>
All these things are irksome to me.' Her mental <lb/>
struggles in time found a balm in the nurture and <lb/>
<pb n="216" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0229"/>
education of her children, to whom she now devoted <lb/>
her whole cares. And amply did they repay her <lb/>
attention. Three days, however, in each year, Lady <lb/>
Russell ever held as days of solemnity&mdash;the day of <lb/>
her marriage, of her lord's trial, and of his death.</p>
<p>Her daughters, on reaching womanhood, were <lb/>
sought in marriage by the noblest and proudest <lb/>
families in the kingdom. The eldest married the <lb/>
heir of the Cavendish family, and in time became <lb/>
Duchess of Devonshire. In like manner, by <reg orig="marry-|ing">marrying</reg> <lb/>
the eldest son, the second daughter became <lb/>
ultimately Duchess of Rutland. By these families, <lb/>
and many other connections, Lady Russell, during <lb/>
the forty years which were allotted to her on earth <lb/>
after her husband's execution, was looked up to as a <lb/>
counsellor and guide; not only in those matters <lb/>
which woman can best regulate, but on every <reg orig="occa-|sion">occasion</reg> <lb/>
of worldly difficulty or distress. Many, many <lb/>
letters, written during her protracted widowhood, <lb/>
have been preserved, all of which breathe the same <lb/>
spirit of kindliness and prudence that pervades her <lb/>
earlier correspondence.</p>
<p>Her son, the hope of the family, succeeded, on <lb/>
arriving at manhood, to the dukedom of Bedford, <lb/>
and by his marriage with the daughter and heiress <lb/>
of John Howland of Streatham, became the father <lb/>
of several children. He was a young <reg orig="noble-|man">nobleman</reg> <lb/>
of great promise, but unfortunately fell a <lb/>
victim to smallpox at the age of thirty-one. How <lb/>
deeply this event afflicted Lady Russell appears <lb/>
partly from her letters; and the blow was followed <lb/>
up in the following year &lpar;1712&rpar; by the death of <lb/>
the Duchess of Rutland. Lady Rachel watched <lb/>
<pb n="217" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0230"/>
over her son's deathbed, and pointed his last <lb/>
thoughts to heaven. Some time after Lady <lb/>
Rutland's death, a circumstance occurred, which <lb/>
shows how deeply all who knew Lord Russell's <lb/>
widow respected her. The Duke of Rutland <lb/>
resolved upon a second marriage, but felt great <lb/>
uneasiness in communicating his intentions to his <lb/>
late wife's mother. A friend undertook to explain <lb/>
his purpose, and accordingly did so. Lady Russell, <lb/>
with that indulgence for the feelings of others <lb/>
which formed so prominent a part of her <reg orig="char-|acter">character</reg>, <lb/>
so conducted herself on meeting the duke, <lb/>
that his wishes seemed to be but the same with <lb/>
her own. At this time she had arrived at that <lb/>
age when the strength of the mind is often gone, <lb/>
and feeble peevishness substituted in its stead.</p>
<p>At the age of eighty-six, Lady Russell was seized <lb/>
with an illness, which proved fatal on the 29th of <lb/>
September 1723, the anniversary of her husband's <lb/>
birthday, which she had long kept so sacred. She <lb/>
was interred by Lord Russell's side, at Chenies, in <lb/>
Buckinghamshire.</p>

<head><hi rend="bold">LADY JANE GREY.</hi></head>
<figure id="f39" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0231"  rend="block"/>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Lady Jane Grey</hi>, born in 1537, was the <lb/>
eldest daughter of Henry Grey, Marquis of <lb/>
Dorset, by his wife Lady Frances Brandon, <lb/>
the daughter of Mary Tudor, youngest sister of <lb/>
Henry VIII. Lady Jane thus inherited the <reg orig="pre-|tensions">pretensions</reg> <lb/>
of a junior branch of the royal family of <lb/>
England, and, failing the descendants of Henry VIII. <lb/>
and his elder sister Margaret of Scotland, would <lb/>
have been the rightful heir to the crown.</p>
<p>She was reared at the country seat of her parents, <lb/>
apparently without any thought of ever being called <lb/>
to fill a throne, for which there were many heirs <lb/>
nearer in title than herself. She is described as <lb/>
having been beyond measure lovely: her features <lb/>
were beautifully regular, and her large and mild <lb/>
eyes were the reflection of a pure and energetic soul, <lb/>
though peaceful and unambitious. She was chiefly <lb/>
remarkable, however, for the extraordinary <reg orig="accom-|plishments">accomplishments</reg> <lb/>
of her mind. Roger Ascham, the <reg orig="pre-|ceptor">preceptor</reg> <lb/>
of her cousin Queen Elizabeth, who knew <lb/>
her intimately, says, 'She possesses good manners, <lb/>
prudence, and a love of labour; she has every talent, <lb/>
without the least weakness of her sex; she speaks <lb/>
French and Italian as well as she does English; she <lb/>
<pb n="219" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0232"/>
writes readily, and with propriety: she has more <lb/>
than once, if you will believe me, spoken Greek to me. <lb/>
Before I went into Germany,' continues this <reg orig="cele-|brated">celebrated</reg> <lb/>
scholar, 'I came to Brodegate, in <reg orig="Leicester-|shire">Leicestershire</reg>, <lb/>
to take my leave of that noble Lady Jane Grey, <lb/>
to whom I was exceeding much beholden. Her <lb/>
parents, the duke and duchess, with all the <reg orig="house-|hold">household</reg>, <lb/>
gentlemen and gentlewomen, were hunting in <lb/>
the park. But I found her in her chamber, reading <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Ph&oelig;don Platonis</hi>, in Greek, with as much delight as <lb/>
some gentleman would read a merrie tale in Boccace. <lb/>
After salutation and duty done, with some other <lb/>
talk, I asked her why she would lose such pastime <lb/>
in the park. Smiling, she answered me, "I wiss all <lb/>
their sport in the park is but a shadow to that <lb/>
pleasure that I find in Plato. Alas, good folk, they <lb/>
never felt what true pleasure meant." "And how <lb/>
came you, madam," quoth I, "to this deep knowledge <lb/>
of pleasure? and what did chiefly allure you into it, <lb/>
seeing not many women, but very few men, have <lb/>
attained thereunto?" "I will tell you," quoth she, <lb/>
"and tell you a truth, which perchance you will <lb/>
marvel at. One of the greatest benefits that ever <lb/>
God gave me is, that he sent me so sharp and severe <lb/>
parents, and so gentle a schoolmaster. In presence <lb/>
of either father and mother, whether I speak, keep <lb/>
silence, sit, stand, or go, eat, drink, be merry or sad, <lb/>
be sewing, playing, dancing or doing anything else, <lb/>
I must do it, as it were, in such weight, measure, <lb/>
and number, even as perfectly as God made the <lb/>
world, or else I am so sharply taunted, so cruelly <lb/>
threatened, yea sometimes with pinches, nips, and <lb/>
other ways, which I will not name for the honour <lb/>
<pb n="220" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0233"/>
I bear them, so without measure misordered, that I <lb/>
think myself in hell, till time come that I must go <lb/>
to Mr Elmer, who teacheth me so gently, so <reg orig="pleas-|antly">pleasantly</reg>, <lb/>
with such fair allurements to learning, that I <lb/>
think all the time nothing while I am with him; <lb/>
and when I am called from him, I fall a-weeping, <lb/>
because whatsoever I do else but learning is full of <lb/>
grief, trouble, fear, and whole misliking unto me. <lb/>
And thus my book hath been so much my pleasure, <lb/>
that, in respect of it, all others are but trifles and <lb/>
troubles unto me!"'</p>
<p>Lady Jane Grey received part of her education <lb/>
with Edward VI., who was of the same age with <lb/>
herself, but, though a very promising youth, was <reg orig="re-|marked">remarked</reg> <lb/>
to make a less rapid progress than his cousin. <lb/>
She also imbibed, with him, the warmest attachment <lb/>
to the reformed religion, then recently introduced <lb/>
into England. In the year 1553 the health of <lb/>
the young king began to decline, and men's thoughts <lb/>
began to be turned upon the succession. The next <lb/>
heir was his elder sister Mary, whose zeal, however, <lb/>
for the Catholic religion, inclined Edward to listen <lb/>
to the counsel of his chief minister, the Duke of <lb/>
Northumberland, for a change in the destination of <lb/>
the crown. Both Mary and the second sister <reg orig="Eliza-|beth">Elizabeth</reg> <lb/>
had been at one time pronounced illegitimate <lb/>
by act of parliament; and though their father <lb/>
had reassigned them their proper rank in his will, <lb/>
there was some colour of law for their exclusion. <lb/>
With regard to Mary of Scotland, who was a Catholic <lb/>
and an alien, the question does not seem to have ever <lb/>
been entertained. Northumberland, seeing the <reg orig="pos-|sibility">possibility</reg> <lb/>
of setting aside these claimants, procured a <lb/>

<pb n="223" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0236"/>
match to be accomplished, May 1553, between Lady <lb/>
Jane Grey and his fourth son Lord Guilford Dudley <lb/>
&mdash;an alliance which seemed to promise his own <reg orig="con-|tinuance">continuance</reg> <lb/>
for a considerable time at the head of <lb/>
affairs, in the event of the death of the king.</p>
<p>The ambition of this able but unprincipled <reg orig="states-|man">statesman</reg> <lb/>
was successful in the first instance. The dying <lb/>
king, wrought upon by his fears for the stability of <lb/>
the Protestant religion, made a will excluding his two <lb/>
sisters, and settling the crown upon Lady Jane Grey. <lb/>
On the 6th of July, the king died, and <reg orig="Northumber-|land">Northumberland</reg>, <lb/>
with some other lords proceeded, on the 9th, <lb/>
to Sion House, where Lady Jane was residing, to <lb/>
salute her as queen. The unfortunate young lady, <lb/>
who had not yet completed her sixteenth year, and <lb/>
from her situation could not be considered as a free <lb/>
agent, heard the intelligence with profound grief <lb/>
and alarm, insomuch as to fall upon the ground in <lb/>
the presence of those proud nobles who had come to <lb/>
bend their knees before her. In vain did she, with <lb/>
tears in her eyes, entreat her father-in-law to permit <lb/>
her to remain in that privacy which she loved. The <lb/>
fulfilment of the ambitious views of two great <lb/>
houses was not to be baulked by the timidity, or <lb/>
even by the reason, of a young girl, over whom they <lb/>
possessed all that authority of the affections, <reg orig="com-|pared">compared</reg> <lb/>
with which that very sovereignty which they <lb/>
acknowledged in her was as nothing. From a mere <lb/>
sentiment of duty, she permitted herself to be <reg orig="con-|sidered">considered</reg> <lb/>
as queen, and accompanied her distinguished <lb/>
relatives to the Tower, which, according to custom, <lb/>
was for some time to be her palace.</p>
<p>The circumstances favourable to her continuance <lb/>
<pb n="224" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0237"/>
in power were the possession by her father-in-law <lb/>
of the seat and powers of government, with the <lb/>
command of the ordinary forces, her own known <lb/>
attachment to the Protestant faith, and the respect <lb/>
paid to the will of the late king. The unfavourable <lb/>
circumstances were the very general prepossession in <lb/>
favour of the descent of the crown to the natural <lb/>
heir, the unpopularity of Northumberland, and the <lb/>
zeal of the Catholics in favour of Mary, while Jane's <lb/>
own Protestant friends were rendered lukewarm by <lb/>
their suspicions of the sincerity of her father-in-law. <lb/>
Northumberland had, immediately before the death <lb/>
of the king, sent for the princesses Mary and <reg orig="Eliza-|beth">Elizabeth</reg>, <lb/>
under the pretence of a desire of their brother <lb/>
to see them, but in reality with a view to make them <lb/>
his prisoners. He even concealed the death of the <lb/>
king for two days in the hope of their arriving. <lb/>
Mary, however, when within a few hours' journey <lb/>
of the metropolis, was apprised of the decease of <lb/>
her brother by a secret friend, and, taking alarm at <lb/>
the absence of official intelligence, withdrew into <lb/>
Suffolk, where she was speedily surrounded by a <lb/>
considerable army. To meet the twelve thousand <lb/>
men with whom she approached London, <reg orig="Northum-|berland">Northumberland</reg> <lb/>
could only bring out half that number. <lb/>
During his absence an insurrection took place in the <lb/>
capital, and the Duke of Suffolk, the father of the <lb/>
young queen, was obliged to give up the Tower to <lb/>
the friends of Mary. He caused the ceremonial of <lb/>
royalty to cease, and its ensigns to be displaced in <lb/>
the apartment of his daughter, who, when, she was <lb/>
exhorted by him to bear her fall with fortitude, <lb/>
answered him with modest composure. 'This is a <lb/>
<pb n="225" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0238"/>
more welcome summons than that which forced me <lb/>
against my will to an elevation to which I am not <lb/>
entitled, and for which I am not qualified. In <reg orig="obedi-|ence">obedience</reg> <lb/>
to you, my lord, and to my mother, I did violence <lb/>
to myself: the present is my own act, and I <reg orig="will-|ingly">willingly</reg> <lb/>
resign.' The next day she returned to her <lb/>
retirement in the monastery of Sion. She reigned <lb/>
ten days, and was called 'a twelfth-day queen' <lb/>
by some buffoon who could look on the <reg orig="misfor-|tunes">misfortunes</reg> <lb/>
of the good as the subject of a sorry jest. <lb/>
Northumberland, being pressed by the superior forces <lb/>
of Mary, found no alternative but to proclaim his <lb/>
enemy as queen, in place of his daughter-in-law. <lb/>
He was immediately taken into custody, tried for <lb/>
high treason, and beheaded.</p>
<p>One of the first uses made by Mary of her <lb/>
authority was to take Jane and her relations into <lb/>
custody. The unfortunate young lady was carried <lb/>
back to the Tower, lately her palace, and now to be <lb/>
her prison and the scene of her death. It is not <lb/>
impossible that Mary, bigoted and cruel as she was, <lb/>
might have ultimately forgiven her young <reg orig="kins-|woman">kinswoman</reg> <lb/>
for an usurpation so evidently involuntary. <lb/>
In the autumn, however, the Duke of Suffolk, who <lb/>
had been pardoned, was so imprudent as to join an <lb/>
insurrection by which Mary's throne was violently <lb/>
shaken. Exasperated by this circumstance, she <lb/>
ordered Lady Jane and her husband to be tried <lb/>
&lpar;Nov. 3&rpar; for high treason. They were condemned, <lb/>
without a time being fixed for the execution. The <lb/>
queen at length determined to remove one whose <lb/>
pretensions were so liable to become a matter of <lb/>
contention. On the 8th day of February 1554, she <lb/>
<pb n="226" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0239"/>
signed a warrant for the execution of 'Guilford <lb/>
Dudley and his wife'&mdash;for such was the description <lb/>
by which they were distinguished at a moment when <lb/>
discourtesy wears its ugliest aspect. On the morning <lb/>
of the 12th, he was led to execution on Tower Hill. <lb/>
Lord Guilford Dudley had requested an interview <lb/>
with his beloved Jane. She, from a fear that it <lb/>
might unfit both for the scene through which they <lb/>
were to pass, declined it. She saw him go through <lb/>
the gate of the Tower towards the scaffold; and soon <lb/>
afterwards she chanced to look from the same <lb/>
window at his bleeding carcase, imperfectly covered, <lb/>
in the cart which bore it back. Feckenham, abbot <lb/>
of Westminster, had endeavoured to convert her to <lb/>
the Catholic faith. He was acute, eloquent, and of <lb/>
a tender nature; but he made no impression on her <lb/>
considerate and steady belief. She behaved to him <lb/>
with such calmness and sweetness, that he had <lb/>
obtained for her day's respite. So much meekness <lb/>
has seldom been so pure from lukewarmness. She <lb/>
wrote a letter to Harding on his apostasy, couched <lb/>
in ardent and even vehement language, partly <lb/>
because she doubted his sincerity. Never did <reg orig="affec-|tion">affection</reg> <lb/>
breathe itself in language more beautiful than <lb/>
in her dying letter to her father, in which she says, <lb/>
'My guiltless blood may cry before the Lord, "Mercy <lb/>
to the innocent!"' A Greek letter to her sister, Lady <lb/>
Catherine, written on a blank leaf of a Greek <reg orig="Testa-|ment">Testament</reg>, <lb/>
is needless as another proof of those <reg orig="accom-|plishments">accomplishments</reg> <lb/>
which astonished the learned of Europe, <lb/>
but admirable as a token that neither grief nor <lb/>
danger could ruffle her thoughts, nor lower the <lb/>
sublimity of her highest sentiments. In the course <lb/>
<pb n="227" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0240"/>
of that morning she wrote in her note-book three <lb/>
sentences in Greek, Latin, and English, of which the <lb/>
last is as follows: 'If my fault deserved punishment, <lb/>
my youth, at least, and my imprudence were <lb/>
worthy of excuse. God and posterity will show me <lb/>
favour.'</p>
<p>She was executed within the Tower, either to <lb/>
withdraw her from the pitying eye of the people, <lb/>
or as a privilege due to the descendant of Henry <lb/>
VII. She declared on the scaffold that 'her soul <lb/>
was as pure from trespass against Queen Mary as <lb/>
innocence was from injustice: I only consented to <lb/>
the thing I was forced into.'</p>
<p>In substance the last allegation was true. The <lb/>
history of tyranny affords no example of a female <lb/>
of seventeen, by the command of a female and a <lb/>
relation, put to death for acquiescence in the <reg orig="injunc-|tion">injunction</reg> <lb/>
of a father, sanctioned by the concurrence of all <lb/>
that the kingdom could boast of what was <reg orig="illus-|trious">illustrious</reg> <lb/>
in nobility, or grave in law, or venerable in <lb/>
religion. The example is the more affecting, as it is <lb/>
that of a person who exhibited a matchless union of <lb/>
youth and beauty, with genius, with learning, with <lb/>
virtue, with piety; whose affections were so warm, <lb/>
while her passions were so perfectly subdued. It <lb/>
was a death sufficient to honour and dishonour an <lb/>
age.</p>

<p>FELICIA DOROTHEA <lb/>
HEMANS was born in <lb/>
Liverpool, on the 25th <lb/>
of September 1794. <lb/>
The family name of <lb/>
this distinguished lady <lb/>
was Browne, her father <lb/>
being George Browne, <lb/>
a native of Ireland, <lb/>
and a merchant of <lb/>
extensive connections <lb/>
in the city alluded to. <lb/>
From this gentleman's <lb/>
union with Miss Wagner, a descendant of an <lb/>
ancient Venetian house, sprung a family of three <lb/>
sons and three daughters, of whom Felicia was the <lb/>
fifth child. To her Italian affinity, Mrs Hemans <lb/>
often alluded playfully, in later years, as the source <lb/>
of that romantic temperament for which she was <lb/>
remarkable even in infancy, and which coloured <lb/>
every thought and aspiration of her after-life. As <lb/>
a child, she exhibited extraordinary quickness and <lb/>
aptitude for instruction, and, fortunately, she was <lb/>
blessed with a mother, of whose care and attention <lb/>
she ever spoke with warm and grateful enthusiasm. <lb/>
To this tender parent, the young Felicia's first <lb/>
attempts at composition were confided; and when <lb/>
<pb n="229" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0242"/>
it is considered that these evidences of talent were <lb/>
presented at the age of seven years, and by a <lb/>
child of extreme beauty&mdash;her features being fine, <lb/>
her complexion brilliantly fair, and her hair long, <lb/>
curling, and golden&mdash;it can scarcely be wondered at, <lb/>
that she should have become almost the idol of her <lb/>
family circle, and an object of admiration to all who <lb/>
knew her.</p>
<p>While the subject of our memoir was still in early <lb/>
childhood, some embarrassments took place in her <lb/>
father's affairs, which caused him to remove his <lb/>
family to Denbighshire, in North Wales. They <lb/>
here inhabited an old and spacious mansion &lpar;called <lb/>
Grwych or Griech&rpar; lying close to the seashore, and <lb/>
in front shut in by a chain of rocky hills. Her <lb/>
residence in this wild solitude, which did not want <lb/>
its goblin stories and recollections, appears to have <lb/>
exercised a similar influence in developing the <lb/>
poetical tendencies of Felicia's mind, as the <reg orig="High-|land">Highland</reg> <lb/>
hills exerted on the youthful genius of Byron. <lb/>
With one of her cherished authors in her hand, it <lb/>
was her delight to roam along the seashore, or on <lb/>
the mountain sides, deepening her enjoyment of the <lb/>
pictures presented to her mind's eye by gazing on <lb/>
the congenial scenes actually surrounding her. Thus, <lb/>
of one of her early favourites, <hi rend="italic">Paul and Virginia</hi>, <lb/>
she sang, long afterwards, <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>O gentle story of the Indian isle!</l>
<l>I loved thee in my lonely childhood well.</l>
<l>On the seashore, when day's last purple smile</l>
<l>Slept on the waters, and their hollow swell</l>
<l>And dying cadence lent a deeper spell</l>
<l>Unto thine ocean pictures.&hellip;</l>
</lg></q>
<pb n="230" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0243"/>
So also may we imagine her to have feasted on the <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Tempest</hi> of her beloved Shakespeare. To enjoy <hi rend="italic">his</hi> <lb/>
creations, secure from interruption, she frequently <lb/>
used to climb an apple-tree, and secrete herself <lb/>
among its dark and spreading foliage.</p>
<p>Such was the training which the mind of the <lb/>
young poetess received. For a poetess she was, as <lb/>
some pieces, composed at the age of nine, and <lb/>
published, with others of a little later composition, <lb/>
in 1808, satisfactorily showed. At the date of this <lb/>
publication the authoress was under fourteen years <lb/>
of age, and her ardent sensitive spirit was so much <lb/>
affected by an unkind criticism which appeared, that <lb/>
she took to bed, and could not raise her drooping <lb/>
head for several days. The chastening, however, <lb/>
was probably of service in showing her the necessity <lb/>
of maturing her efforts by study and meditation. <lb/>
Her second production, entitled <hi rend="italic">Domestic Affections</hi>, <lb/>
appeared in 1812, and exhibited a progressive <reg orig="ripen-|ing">ripening</reg> <lb/>
of her powers. But on this early part of her <lb/>
literary career it would be injudicious to linger, <lb/>
when so much of higher and deeper interest lies <lb/>
before us. It may only be observed, that in many <lb/>
of the pieces contained in her second publication, the <lb/>
poetess reveals the first indications of that sympathy <lb/>
with the lofty and the chivalrous which pervades all <lb/>
her later effusions, and which blends strangely, <lb/>
though in her hands not inharmoniously, with <lb/>
themes of domestic love and duty. The birth and <lb/>
growth of the feeling in question is to be ascribed <lb/>
to the circumstance of her having a beloved brother <lb/>
engaged in the long and arduous contest on the <lb/>
'blood-red fields of Spain.'</p>
<pb n="231" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0244"/>
<p>In the year 1812 Felicia was married to Captain <lb/>
Hemans. 'This union,' says her biographer, Mr <lb/>
Chorley, 'may be said to have closed, shortly before <lb/>
the birth of a fifth son, by a protracted separation.' <lb/>
Several causes are said to have operated in leading <lb/>
to this unpleasing event. Captain Heman's health <lb/>
had been injured by his military career, so much as <lb/>
to render it necessary for him to exchange his native <lb/>
climate for the milder skies of Italy. It is <reg orig="undeni-|able">undeniable</reg>, <lb/>
besides, that the tastes of the wedded pair had <lb/>
proved uncongenial, and their separation took place <lb/>
by mutual consent. Mrs Hemans afterwards lived <lb/>
with her children at a place called Bronwylfa, near <lb/>
St Asaph, whither her mother and sister had latterly <lb/>
removed. Here Mrs Hemans sought for the <reg orig="restora-|tion">restoration</reg> <lb/>
of her mental composure, by ardently pursuing <lb/>
the studies which she loved, and by devoting herself <lb/>
to the education of her children. Though never <lb/>
placed at any public seminary, she had formerly <lb/>
acquired a slight knowledge of the Latin tongue, and <lb/>
she now made herself familiar with Italian, German, <lb/>
and other modern languages. This acquaintance she <lb/>
maintained and continued to improve through her <lb/>
life, as a variety of translations, from the Latin of <lb/>
Horace, the Portuguese of Camoens, the German of <lb/>
Goethe, and the Spanish of Herrera, executed at <lb/>
various times, will enduringly prove. One of her <lb/>
first compositions, after her separation from her <lb/>
husband in 1818, was connected with this branch <lb/>
of her studies&mdash;being a series of papers on 'Foreign <lb/>
Literature' which were published in the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh <lb/>
Magazine</hi> for 1819.</p>
<p>This period of her life&mdash;that is to say, the four or <lb/>
<pb n="232" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0245"/>
five years following 1819&mdash;was distinguished by a <lb/>
number of brilliant poetical effusions, which not only <lb/>
brought her name into general notice, but placed it <lb/>
among the brightest of the day and the land, and <lb/>
gained her the applause of Byron and Shelley, the <lb/>
friendship of Heber and Milman, and the love and <lb/>
esteem of such women as Baillie, Mitford, Howitt, <lb/>
and Jewsbury. We can scarcely do more than <lb/>
enumerate in succession the productions which won <lb/>
such a reputation and such friendships as these. <lb/>
The poems called the <hi rend="italic">Restoration of the Works of <lb/>
Art in Italy, Modern Greece, Tales and Historic <lb/>
Scenes</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic">Sceptic</hi>, were all composed during <lb/>
the years 1819, 1820, and 1821. Her poem of <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Wallace</hi> was published during the same period, and <lb/>
gained a private prize, as the poem of <hi rend="italic">Dartmoor</hi> <lb/>
did a public one, from the Royal Society of <reg orig="Litera-|ture">Literature</reg> <lb/>
in 1821. The <hi rend="italic">Siege of Valentia, the Last <lb/>
Constantine, and other Poems</hi>, formed a volume <lb/>
published in 1823; and in the same year a tragedy, <lb/>
entitled the <hi rend="italic">Vespers of Palermo</hi>, was produced at <lb/>
Covent Garden. This play was admired by Milman <lb/>
and Sir Walter Scott, but was too purely poetical <lb/>
for success on the stage.</p>
<p>Continuing the list of Mrs Hemans's productions <lb/>
from the year 1823 up to the close of 1827&mdash;which <lb/>
constituted a memorable era in her life, for at that <lb/>
time she left her residence in Wales, and entered for <lb/>
the first time into <hi rend="italic">personal</hi> intercourse with the <lb/>
world&mdash;we find that many of her most beautiful <lb/>
minor pieces were contributed during this period to <lb/>
the <hi rend="italic">New Monthly Magazine</hi> and other works of the <lb/>
same nature. Though <hi rend="italic">minor</hi> pieces, however, these <lb/>
<pb n="233" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0246"/>
poems were not <hi rend="italic">fugitive</hi>, as the names of the <hi rend="italic">Voice <lb/>
of Spring</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Graves of a Household</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Homes <lb/>
of England</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Treasures of the Deep</hi>, and many <lb/>
others, will prove. Nor were these all the works <lb/>
which came from Mrs Hemans's pen before leaving <lb/>
Wales. In 1827 she gave to the world her <hi rend="italic">Forest <lb/>
Sanctuary and other Poems</hi>, and in the beginning <lb/>
of the following year, her <hi rend="italic">Records of Woman</hi>.</p>
<p>Before following the history of Mrs Hemans's life, <lb/>
after her removal from Wales to Liverpool, and her <lb/>
entrance into the society of those with whom she <lb/>
had held intercourse, for a longer or shorter period, <lb/>
by correspondence, it is proper that we should refer <lb/>
for a moment to the brilliant series of works which <lb/>
has been enumerated, and which had, in the course <lb/>
of ten years, raised the name of the secluded <lb/>
sojourner in Wales to the first rank among the <lb/>
female writers of her country. The harp of Mrs <lb/>
Hemans, it may be said, had two leading chords. <lb/>
The tones of the one sounded of high and chivalrous <lb/>
deeds and feelings; the other spoke of love, and the <lb/>
holy ties of domestic duty. These themes, <reg orig="some-|times">sometimes</reg> <lb/>
apart, and sometimes blended together, were <lb/>
those on which the genius of the poetess loved to <lb/>
dwell and dilate. A feminine delicacy and <reg orig="graceful-|ness">gracefulness</reg> <lb/>
of thought and expression, with a rich <reg orig="abund-|ance">abundance</reg> <lb/>
of imagery, and a never-failing harmony of <lb/>
versification, are the characteristics of Mrs Hemans's <lb/>
poetical style. It has been said that her tone was <lb/>
ever too sad, but the sadness was of a kind that <lb/>
drew the thoughts to the sources of hope and joy, <lb/>
though they might be pictured as lying in the <lb/>
distance.</p>
<pb n="234" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0247"/>
<p>We must now return from Mrs Hemans's poetry <lb/>
to her life. In 1828 she came, on the occasion of <lb/>
her mother's death, to Liverpool, and after a time <lb/>
took up her residence at Wavertree, a village three <lb/>
miles distant from the city. Perhaps no woman <lb/>
ever made her entrance into society with such a <lb/>
name and fame as our poetess did. How well her <lb/>
personal appearance and manners were calculated to <lb/>
bear out the impression made by her writings, will <lb/>
appear from the following description of her, under <lb/>
the name of Egeria, by Miss Jewsbury, who resided <lb/>
near Liverpool, and was honoured with her warmest <lb/>
friendship: 'Egeria was totally different from any <lb/>
other woman I had ever seen, either in Italy or <lb/>
England. She did not dazzle&mdash;she subdued me. <lb/>
Other women might be more commanding, more <lb/>
versatile, more acute; but I never saw one so <lb/>
exquisitely feminine. She was lovely without being <lb/>
beautiful; her movements were features; and if a <lb/>
blind man had been privileged to pass his hand over <lb/>
the silken length of hair, that when unbraided <lb/>
flowed round her like a veil, he would have been <lb/>
justified in expecting softness and a love of softness, <lb/>
beauty and a perception of beauty, to be distinctive <lb/>
traits of her mind. Nor would he have been <lb/>
deceived. Her birth, her education, but, above all, <lb/>
the genius with which she was gifted, combined to <lb/>
inspire a passion for the ethereal, the tender, the <lb/>
imaginative, the heroic&mdash;in one word, the beautiful. <lb/>
Her knowledge was extensive and various, but, true <lb/>
to the first principle of her nature, it was poetry <lb/>
that she sought in history, scenery, character, and <lb/>
religious belief&mdash;poetry that guided all her studies, <lb/>
<pb n="235" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0248"/>
governed all her thoughts, coloured all her <reg orig="conversa-|tion">conversation</reg>. <lb/>
Her nature was at once simple and profound; <lb/>
there was no room in her mind for philosophy, or in <lb/>
her heart for ambition&mdash;one was filled by <reg orig="imagina-|tion">imagination</reg>, <lb/>
the other engrossed by tenderness. Her strength <lb/>
and her weakness alike lay in her affections: these <lb/>
would sometimes make her weep at a word; at <lb/>
others, imbue her with courage; so that she was <lb/>
alternately a "falcon-hearted dove," and "a reed <lb/>
shaken with the wind." Her voice was a sad, sweet <lb/>
melody; her spirits reminded me of an old poet's <lb/>
description of the orange-tree, with its <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>Golden lamps hid in a night of green,</l>
</lg></q>
or of those Spanish gardens where the pomegranate <lb/>
grows beside the cypress. Her gladness was like <lb/>
a burst of sunlight: and if in her depression she <lb/>
resembled night, it was night wearing her stars. I <lb/>
might describe, and describe for ever, but I should <lb/>
never succeed in portraying Egeria; she was a muse, <lb/>
a grace, a variable child, a dependent woman&mdash;the <lb/>
Italy of human beings.'</p>
<p>Can we wonder at the admiration such a woman <lb/>
attracted in society? Her admirers, indeed, actually <lb/>
showered their homage on her, in the shape of <lb/>
sonnets and verses innumerable, from every corner <lb/>
of Britain. America was scarcely less enthusiastic <lb/>
in her praise; Dr Channing was one of Mrs Hemans's <lb/>
most regular and esteemed correspondents, and many <lb/>
other distinguished men of the same country paid <lb/>
her the tribute of their applause. In her converse <lb/>
and correspondence, Mrs Hemans often exhibited a <lb/>
fund of playful humour that did not appear in her <lb/>
<pb n="236" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0249"/>
poetry. Occasionally, however, the poetess did make <lb/>
little escapades in rhyme. For example, a grave <lb/>
philologist and lexicographer asked her on one <reg orig="occa-|sion">occasion</reg> <lb/>
to help him to some authorities, in the old <lb/>
English writers, for the use of the word <hi rend="italic">Barb</hi>. She <lb/>
in a short time delighted the ancient simpleton with <lb/>
a dozen examples of the word in the classics of <lb/>
Britain. Here are one or two of them: <lb/>
<q><lg type="stanza">
<l>The warrior donned his well-worn garb,</l>
<l rend="indent">And proudly waved his crest,</l>
<l>He mounted on his jet-black <hi rend="italic">barb</hi>,</l>
<l rend="indent">And put his lance in rest.</l>
<l rend="indent2"><hi rend="italic">Percy's Reliques</hi>.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>Eftsoons the wight withouten more delay,</l>
<l>Spurred his brown <hi rend="italic">barb</hi> and rode full swiftly on his way.</l>
<l rend="indent"><hi rend="italic">Spenser</hi>.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>O bonnie looked my ain true knight,</l>
<l rend="indent">His <hi rend="italic">barb</hi> so proudly reining,</l>
<l>I watched him till my tearfu' sight</l>
<l rend="indent">Grew a'maist dim wi' straining.</l>
<l rend="indent2"><hi rend="italic">Border Minstrelsy</hi>.</l>
</lg></q>
<q>Why, he can heel the lavolt and wind a fiery <hi rend="italic">barb</hi> as well as <lb/>
any gallant in Christendom. He's the very pink and mirror of <lb/>
accomplishment.&mdash;<hi rend="italic">Shakespeare</hi>.</q>
Many other examples besides these were presented to <lb/>
the enraptured <hi rend="italic">barb</hi>-hunter; but, lo! the quotations <lb/>
turned out to be only imitations, thrown off in a <lb/>
moment of wicked mirth by the poetess!</p>
<p>Early in the summer of 1829, urged by numerous <lb/>
invitations, Mrs Hemans paid a visit to Scotland. <lb/>
Her first residence was Chiefswood, near Melrose, <lb/>
the house of her accomplished friend and <reg orig="corre-|spondent">correspondent</reg>, <lb/>
Colonel Hamilton, the author of <hi rend="italic">Cyril <lb/>
Thornton</hi>. With a still more eminent admirer, Sir <lb/>
<pb n="237" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0250"/>
Walter Scott, she now became for the first time <reg orig="per-|sonally">personally</reg> <lb/>
acquainted, and many interesting memorials <lb/>
of her intercourse with the great novelist are given <lb/>
in her letters, written during a short stay with him <lb/>
at Abbotsford. Sir Walter's manly modesty of <reg orig="char-|acter">character</reg> <lb/>
pleased her beyond expression. 'Never,' said <lb/>
she to a friend, 'did I hear him make any allusion to <lb/>
his own fame, except on one occasion when we <lb/>
visited Newark Tower, and, on seeing two tourists <lb/>
make a precipitate retreat at our approach, he said, <lb/>
smiling, "Ah, Mrs Hemans, they little know what <lb/>
two lions they are running away from!"' The rich <lb/>
baronial look of Abbotsford, its fa&euml;ry sculptures, and <lb/>
its antique treasures, delighted the poetess, and her <lb/>
chivalric sympathies revelled amid the swords and <lb/>
armour of the old minstrel, of whom she said, 'The <lb/>
whole expression of his benevolent countenance <lb/>
changes if he has but to speak of the dirk and the <lb/>
claymore: you see the spirit that would "say amidst <lb/>
the trumpets, ha! ha!" suddenly flashing from his <lb/>
gray eyes, and sometimes, in repeating a verse of <lb/>
warlike minstrelsy, he will spring up as if he sought <lb/>
the sound of a distant gathering-cry.'</p>
<p>An extract from one of her letters will show her <lb/>
pleasant intercourse with Scott: 'You will be pleased <lb/>
to think of me, as I now am, in constant, almost <lb/>
daily, intercourse with Sir Walter Scott, who has <lb/>
greeted me to this mountain land in the kindest <lb/>
manner, and with whom I talk freely and happily, <lb/>
as to an old familiar friend. I have taken several <lb/>
long walks with him over moor and <hi rend="italic">brae</hi>, and <lb/>
it is indeed delightful to see him thus, and to <lb/>
hear him pour forth, from the fullness of his rich <lb/>
<pb n="238" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0251"/>
mind and peopled memory, song, and legend, and <lb/>
tale of old, until I could almost fancy I heard the <lb/>
gathering-cry of some chieftain of the hills, so <reg orig="com-|pletely">completely</reg> <lb/>
does his spirit carry me back to the days <lb/>
of the slogan and the fiery-cross. The other day, he <lb/>
most kindly made a party to take me to the banks <lb/>
of Yarrow, about ten miles from hence. I went <lb/>
with him in an open carriage. We forded Ettrick <lb/>
River, passed Carterhaugh &lpar;the scene of the wild <lb/>
fairy legend of <hi rend="italic">Tam o' Linn</hi>&rpar;, and many a cairn <lb/>
and field of old combat, the heroes of which seemed <lb/>
to start up before me, in answer to the "mighty <lb/>
master's" voice, which related their deeds as we went <lb/>
by. And he is, indeed, a fitting narrator: his whole <lb/>
countenance&mdash;the predominant expression of which <lb/>
is generally a sort of arch benevolence&mdash;changes <lb/>
the slightest allusion to any "bold emprize." It is <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>As the stream late concealed</l>
<l rend="indent">By the fringe of its willows,</l>
<l>When it flashes, revealed</l>
<l rend="indent">In the light of its billows;</l>
</lg></q>
or like the war-horse at the sound of the trumpet. <lb/>
Sometimes, in reciting a verse of old martial song, <lb/>
he will suddenly spring up, and one feels ready to <lb/>
exclaim&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>Charge, Chester, charge!&mdash;on, Stanley, on!</l>
</lg></q>
so completely is the electric chain struck by his own <lb/>
high emotion. But Yarrow! beautiful Yarrow! we <lb/>
wound along its banks, through some stately grounds <lb/>
belonging to the Duke of Buccleuch; and was it not <lb/>
like a dream to be walking there with Sir Walter <lb/>
Scott by my side, reciting, every now and then, some <lb/>
verse of the fine old ballad? We visited Newark <lb/>
<pb n="239" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0252"/>
Tower, and returned to Abbotsford through the <lb/>
Tweed. The rest of the day was passed at that <lb/>
glorious place, the hall of which, in particular, is a <lb/>
scene to dream of, with the rich, purple light <reg orig="stream-|ing">streaming</reg> <lb/>
in through its coloured windows, and mantling <lb/>
its stately suits of armour and heraldic blazonries. <lb/>
We had a great deal of music in the evening&mdash;Sir <lb/>
Walter is particularly fond of national airs&mdash;and I <lb/>
played many of my waltzes, and mazurkas, and <lb/>
Spanish melodies, for which I wish you could have <lb/>
heard how kindly and gracefully he thanked me. <lb/>
&lsqb;His words, treasured up by her boys, were&mdash; 'I <lb/>
should say you had <hi rend="italic">too many</hi> gifts, Mrs Hemans, <lb/>
were they not all made to give pleasure to those <lb/>
around you.'&rsqb; I am fortunate in seeing him, as I <lb/>
do, surrounded only by his children and <reg orig="grand-|children">grandchildren</reg>, <lb/>
wandering through his own woods, taking <lb/>
the fresh delight of an unquenchably youthful spirit <lb/>
in the creations of his own hands. It is all so <lb/>
healthful to see and feel! The boys, too, are quite <lb/>
at home with him, and he sometimes sings to <lb/>
Charlie&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>Charlie is my darling, my darling, my darling,</l>
<l>Charlie is my darling, the young Chevalier.'</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>Mrs Hemans resided for some months at <reg orig="Edin-|burgh">Edinburgh</reg>, <lb/>
after visiting Abbotsford, and was <reg orig="flatter-|ingly">flatteringly</reg> <lb/>
entertained by the literary and polite circles <lb/>
of that city. She then returned to Wavertree, near <lb/>
Liverpool, and published, in the summer of 1830, her <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Songs of the Affections</hi>, most of which had been <lb/>
published separately in <hi rend="italic">Blackwood's Magazine</hi>. In <lb/>
the same summer, she put into execution her <reg orig="long-|cherished">long-cherished</reg> <lb/>
plan of visiting the Lakes in the north <lb/>
<pb n="240" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0253"/>
of England. Here she lived for some days with <lb/>
Wordsworth at Rydal Mount, and afterwards resided <lb/>
for a week or two at a cottage called the Dove's <lb/>
Nest. 'You will be pleased,' she writes, 'to hear <lb/>
that the more I see of Mr Wordsworth, the more I <lb/>
admire, and I may almost say, love him. It is <lb/>
delightful to see a life in such perfect harmony with <lb/>
all that his writings express, "true to the kindred <lb/>
points of heaven and home." '</p>
<p>From the Lakes, Mrs Hemans was again induced, <lb/>
in the autumn of 1830, to proceed to Scotland, where <lb/>
she resided chiefly at her friend Sir Robert Liston's <lb/>
seat of Lilburn Tower. She describes Lord Jeffrey, <lb/>
whom she visited, as 'unequalled in rapid brilliancy <lb/>
of image and illustration, yet so easy, playful, and <lb/>
natural, that its brightness never seemed in the <lb/>
least fatiguing.' It was during this visit at Lilburn <lb/>
Tower that Mrs Hemans formed a friendship which <lb/>
led her to visit Dublin before returning to England. <lb/>
When she did return to her native country, it was <lb/>
only to make preparations for taking up her <reg orig="resi-|dence">residence</reg> <lb/>
permanently in the Irish capital. Her own <lb/>
health had become of late precarious, from an <reg orig="affec-|tion">affection</reg> <lb/>
of the heart, and this was one motive for the <lb/>
step in question. The views which she entertained <lb/>
for her boys formed another reason. After visiting <lb/>
Wales, Mrs Hemans took leave of England, in the <lb/>
spring of 1831, for the last time, at it unhappily <lb/>
proved.</p>
<p>In Ireland, Mrs Hemans mingled little in society, <lb/>
excepting with a few intimate personal friends, of <lb/>
whom the Archbishop of Dublin was one of the <lb/>
kindest and most attentive. The frame of the poetess <lb/>
<pb n="241" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0254"/>
was now progressively decreasing in strength, though <lb/>
her mind was unabated in its energies and activity. <lb/>
In 1833 and 1834, she prepared for the press and <lb/>
published three little works, <hi rend="italic">Hymns for Childhood, <lb/>
National Lyrics and Songs for Music</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Scenes <lb/>
and Hymns of Life</hi>, all of which sustained her <lb/>
reputation. In the beginning of 1835, she became <lb/>
so weak as to excite the deepest fears among her <lb/>
friends and the public. The strongest sympathy <lb/>
was evinced over the whole land. But her malady <lb/>
rapidly increased, and on the 16th of May her <lb/>
spirit passed away from earth, without a sigh or a <lb/>
struggle. A sister poetess, Mrs Browning, wrote a <lb/>
fine poem to her memory.</p>

<figure id="f45" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0255" rend="block"/>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">In</hi> the real as distinguished from the ideal <lb/>
school of fiction, Charlotte Bront&euml; &lpar;born <lb/>
1816&rpar;, afterwards Nicholls, by her tale of <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Jane Eyre</hi>, attained immediate and remarkable <lb/>
popularity. Its Yorkshire scenes and characters <lb/>
were new to readers, and the whole had the stamp <lb/>
of truth and close observation. The life of Charlotte <lb/>
Bront&euml; was one of deep and painful interest. Her <lb/>
father, the Rev. Patrick Bront&euml;&mdash;who survived to a <lb/>
great age, outliving all his gifted children&mdash;was a <lb/>
native of County Down, in Ireland, and author of <lb/>
two small volumes of verse. His family name was <lb/>
Prunty, which he changed to Bront&euml; shortly before <lb/>
leaving Ireland. One of a family of ten, the <lb/>
children of a small farmer, Patrick Bront&euml; saw the <lb/>
necessity for early exertion. At the age of sixteen <lb/>
<pb n="243" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0256"/>
he opened a school, then became a tutor in a <reg orig="gentle-|man's">gentleman's</reg> <lb/>
family, and afterwards, at the age of <reg orig="twenty-|five">twenty-five</reg>, <lb/>
entered himself of St John's College, Cambridge. <lb/>
Having taken his degree, he obtained a curacy in <lb/>
Essex, whence he removed to Yorkshire&mdash;first to <lb/>
Hartshead, near Leeds. At Hartshead he married <lb/>
&lpar;1812&rpar; a gentle, serious young Cornish woman, <lb/>
Maria Branwell, by whom in little more than six <lb/>
years he had six children. In 1820 the family <lb/>
moved to another Yorkshire home, Mr Bront&euml; <lb/>
having obtained the living of Haworth, four miles <lb/>
from Keighley. The income of the minister, &pound;200 <lb/>
per annum, with his wife's annuity of &pound;50 a year, <lb/>
might have sufficed for humble comfort; but the <lb/>
parsonage was bleak and uncomfortable&mdash;a low <lb/>
oblong stone building, standing at the top of the <lb/>
straggling village on a steep hill, without the shelter <lb/>
of a tree, with the churchyard pressing down on <lb/>
it on both sides, and behind, a long tract of wild <lb/>
moors. Charlotte Bront&euml; thus describes the scene:</p>
<p>'A village parsonage amongst the hills bordering <lb/>
Yorkshire and Lancashire. The scenery of these <lb/>
hills is not grand&mdash;it is not romantic; it is scarcely <lb/>
striking. Long low moors, dark with heath, shut in <lb/>
little valleys, where a stream waters, here and there, <lb/>
a fringe of stunted copse. Mills and scattered <lb/>
cottages chase romance from these valleys: it is <lb/>
only higher up, deep in amongst the ridges of the <lb/>
moors, that Imagination can find rest for the sole <lb/>
of her foot; and even if she finds it there, she must <lb/>
be a solitude-loving raven&mdash;no gentle dove. If she <lb/>
demand beauty to inspire her, she must bring it <lb/>
inborn: these moors are too stern to yield any <reg orig="pro-|duct">product</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="244" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0257"/>
so delicate. The eye of the gazer must <hi rend="italic">itself</hi> <lb/>
brim with a "purple light," intense enough to <reg orig="per-|petuate">perpetuate</reg> <lb/>
the brief flower-flush of August on the <lb/>
heather, or the rare sunset-smile of June; out of <lb/>
his heart must well the freshness that in later spring <lb/>
and early summer brightens the bracken, nurtures <lb/>
the moss, and cherishes the starry flowers that <lb/>
spangle for a few weeks the pasture of the <reg orig="moor-|sheep">moorsheep</reg>. <lb/>
Unless that light and freshness are innate <lb/>
and self-sustained, the drear prospect of a Yorkshire <lb/>
moor will be found as barren of poetic as of <reg orig="agri-|cultural">agricultural</reg> <lb/>
interest: where the love of wild nature is <lb/>
strong, the locality will perhaps be clung to with the <lb/>
more passionate constancy, because from the <reg orig="hill-|lover's">hilllover's</reg> <lb/>
self comes half its charm.'</p>
<p>The population of Haworth and its neighbourhood <lb/>
was chiefly engaged in the worsted manufacture. <lb/>
They were noted for a wild lawless energy, and were <lb/>
divided by sectarian differences. The Bront&euml; family <lb/>
kept aloof unless when direct service was required, <lb/>
and the minister always carried a pistol with him on <lb/>
his walks. He was an eccentric, half-misanthropical <lb/>
man, with absurd notions on the subject of education. <lb/>
He kept his children on a vegetable diet, and clothed <lb/>
them in the humblest garments, that they might grow <lb/>
up hardy and indifferent to dress. He took his meals <lb/>
in his own room. His wife died the year after the <lb/>
arrival of the family at Haworth, and the poor <lb/>
children were mostly left to themselves, occupying <lb/>
a room called the 'children's study'&mdash;though the <lb/>
eldest <hi rend="italic">student</hi> was only about seven years of age&mdash; <lb/>
or they wandered hand in hand over the moors. <lb/>
They were all small and feeble, stunted in their <lb/>
<pb n="245" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0258"/>
growth, but with remarkable precocity of intellect. <lb/>
The eccentric minister one day made an experiment <lb/>
to test their powers of reflection or understanding. <lb/>
He had a mask in the house, and thinking they <lb/>
might speak with less timidity if thus concealed, he <lb/>
told them all to stand and speak boldly from under <lb/>
cover of the mask. The youngest, about four years <lb/>
of age, was asked what a child like her most <lb/>
wanted; she answered: 'Age and experience.' The <lb/>
next was asked what had best be done with her <lb/>
brother, who was sometimes a naughty boy: 'Reason <lb/>
with him,' she said; 'and when he won't listen to <lb/>
reason, whip him.' The boy was then questioned as <lb/>
to the best way of knowing the difference between <lb/>
the intellects of man and woman, and he replied: <lb/>
'By considering the difference between them as to <lb/>
their bodies.' Charlotte was asked what was the <lb/>
best book in the world: 'The Bible,' she said; 'and <lb/>
next to that, the Book of Nature.' Another was <lb/>
asked what was the best education for a woman, and <lb/>
she replied: 'That which would make her rule her <lb/>
house well.' Lastly, the oldest&mdash;about ten years of <lb/>
age&mdash;was asked what was the best mode of spending <lb/>
time, and she answered: 'By laying it out in <lb/>
preparation for a happy eternity.'</p>
<p>These extraordinary little reasoners took a great <lb/>
interest in politics and public events; they read and <lb/>
discussed the newspapers, and set up among <reg orig="them-|selves">themselves</reg> <lb/>
'little magazines' in imitation of <hi rend="italic">Blackwood's <lb/>
Magazine</hi>. Tales, dramas, poems, and romances were <lb/>
all attempted by the girls; and in one period of <lb/>
fifteen months, before she was fifteen years of age, <lb/>
Charlotte had filled twenty-two volumes with original <lb/>
<pb n="246" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0259"/>
compositions, written in a hand so painfully small <lb/>
and close as scarcely to be decipherable without the <lb/>
aid of a magnifying-glass. Four of the girls were <lb/>
at length sent out to be educated. An active, <lb/>
wealthy clergyman, the Rev. W. Carus Wilson, <lb/>
established a school for the education of the <lb/>
daughters of poor clergymen at a place called <lb/>
Cowan's Bridge, between Leeds and Kendal. Each <lb/>
pupil paid &pound;14 a year, with &pound;1 of entrance-money. <lb/>
The institution, however, was badly managed. The <lb/>
food was insufficient and badly cooked, and one <lb/>
of the teachers&mdash;satirised in <hi rend="italic">Jane Eyre</hi> as 'Miss <lb/>
Scatcherd'&mdash;tyrannised over one of the Bront&euml;s with <lb/>
inhuman severity. A fever afterwards broke out in <lb/>
the school, and the little band of sisters returned to <lb/>
the old stone parsonage and the 'children's study' <lb/>
at Haworth. Death, however, soon thinned the <lb/>
affectionate group. Maria died in 1825 in her <lb/>
twelfth year, and in the same year Elizabeth, aged <lb/>
eleven. Branwell, the only boy of the family, was <lb/>
educated at home; he had the family talent and <lb/>
precocity, wrote verses, and had a turn for drawing, <lb/>
but ultimately became idle and dissipated, and <lb/>
occasioned the most poignant distress to his sisters. <lb/>
The latter made many efforts to place themselves <lb/>
in an independent position. They went out as <lb/>
governesses, but disliked the occupation. Charlotte <lb/>
wrote to Southey, sending some of her poetry, and <lb/>
the laureate replied in a kindly but discouraging <lb/>
tone. The project of keeping a school was then <lb/>
suggested. The aunt&mdash;who had come from Cornwall <lb/>
and assisted at Haworth since the death of her sister <lb/>
&mdash;advanced a little money, and Charlotte and Emily <lb/>
<pb n="247" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0260"/>
proceeded to Brussels in order to acquire a knowledge <lb/>
of foreign languages. They entered a <hi rend="italic">pensionnat</hi>, <lb/>
and remained from February to September 1842, <lb/>
when they were recalled by the death of their aunt. <lb/>
Charlotte again returned to Brussels, and officiated <lb/>
about a twelvemonth as a teacher, her salary being <lb/>
just &pound;16 per annum, out of which she had to pay ten <lb/>
francs a month for German lessons. In January 1844 <lb/>
she was again at Haworth. The sisters advertised <lb/>
that they would receive pupils in the parsonage; but <lb/>
no pupils came. They then ventured on the <reg orig="publica-|tion">publication</reg> <lb/>
of a volume of their poems. The death of their <lb/>
aunt had somewhat improved their circumstances, <lb/>
and a sum of &pound;31, 10s. was spent in printing the <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Poems, by Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell</hi>. This <lb/>
ambiguous choice of names was dictated, as Charlotte <lb/>
relates, by 'a sort of conscientious scruple at <reg orig="assum-|ing">assuming</reg> <lb/>
Christian names positively masculine, while they <lb/>
did not like to declare themselves women.' The <lb/>
volume had little success. The best of the pieces are <lb/>
those by Emily, who had more vivacity and force <lb/>
of character than her sisters. Mrs Gaskell, in her <lb/>
interesting <hi rend="italic">Life of Charlotte Bront&euml;</hi>, has the <reg orig="follow-|ing">following</reg> <lb/>
remarkable statement relative to Emily, and the <lb/>
passage also illustrates Charlotte's novel of <hi rend="italic">Shirley:</hi></p>
<p>'From her, many traits in Shirley's character were <lb/>
taken: her way of sitting on the rug reading, with <lb/>
her arm round her rough bulldog's neck; her calling <lb/>
to a strange dog running past with hanging head and <lb/>
lolling tongue, to give it a merciful draught of water, <lb/>
its maddened snap at her, her nobly stern presence of <lb/>
mind, going right into the kitchen, and taking up one <lb/>
of Tabby's &lpar;the old servant in the parsonage&rpar; red-hot <lb/>
<pb n="248" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0261"/>
Italian irons to sear the bitten place, and telling no <lb/>
one, till the danger was well-nigh over, for fear of <lb/>
the terrors that might beset their weaker minds. All <lb/>
this, looked upon as a well-invented fiction in <hi rend="italic">Shirley</hi>, <lb/>
was written down by Charlotte with streaming eyes; <lb/>
it was the literal account of what Emily had done. <lb/>
The same tawny bulldog &lpar;with his "strangled whistle"&rpar; <lb/>
called Tartar in <hi rend="italic">Shirley</hi>, was Keeper in Haworth <lb/>
parsonage&mdash;a gift to Emily. With the gift came a <lb/>
warning. Keeper was faithful to the depths of his <lb/>
nature as long as he was with friends; but he who <lb/>
struck him with a stick or whip roused the relentless <lb/>
nature of the brute, who flew at his throat forthwith, <lb/>
and held him there till one or the other was at the <lb/>
point of death. Now Keeper's household fault was <lb/>
this: he loved to steal up-stairs, and stretch his <lb/>
square, tawny limbs on the comfortable beds, covered <lb/>
over with white delicate counterpanes. But the <lb/>
cleanliness of the parsonage arrangements was perfect, <lb/>
and Emily declared that if he was found again <reg orig="trans-|gressing">transgressing</reg>, <lb/>
she herself, in defiance of warning and his <lb/>
well-known ferocity of nature, would beat him so <lb/>
severely, that he would never offend again. In the <lb/>
gathering dusk of the evening, Tabby came to tell <lb/>
Emily that Keeper was lying on the best bed <lb/>
in drowsy voluptuousness. Charlotte saw Emily's <lb/>
whitening face and set mouth, but dared not <reg orig="inter-|fere">interfere</reg>; <lb/>
no one dared when Emily's eyes glowed in that <lb/>
manner out of the paleness of her face, and when her <lb/>
lips were so compressed into stone. She went <reg orig="up-|stairs">upstairs</reg>, <lb/>
and Tabby and Charlotte stood in the gloomy <lb/>
passage below. Down-stairs came Emily, dragging <lb/>
after her the unwilling Keeper, his hind-legs set in a <lb/>
<pb n="249" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0262"/>
heavy attitude of resistance, held by the "scuft of his <lb/>
neck," but growling low and savagely all the time. <lb/>
The watchers would fain have spoken, but durst not, <lb/>
for fear of taking off Emily's attention, and causing <lb/>
her to avert her head for a moment from the enraged <lb/>
brute. She let him go, planted in a dark corner at <lb/>
the bottom of the stairs; no time was there to fetch <lb/>
stick or rod, for fear of the strangling clutch at her <lb/>
throat&mdash;her bare clenched fist struck against his red <lb/>
fierce eyes, before he had time to make his spring, <lb/>
and, in the language of the turf, she "punished" him <lb/>
till his eyes were swelled up, and the half-blind <lb/>
stupefied beast was led to his accustomed lair to have <lb/>
his swollen head fomented and cared for by the <lb/>
very Emily herself. The generous dog owed her no <lb/>
grudge; he loved her dearly ever after; he walked <lb/>
first among the mourners at her funeral; he slept <lb/>
moaning for nights at the door of her empty room; <lb/>
and never, so to speak, rejoiced, dog-fashion, after her <lb/>
death.'</p>
<p>Each of the three sisters commenced a novel; <lb/>
Charlotte's was called <hi rend="italic">The Professor;</hi> Emily's, <hi rend="italic"><reg orig="Wuther-|ing">Wuthering</reg> <lb/>
Heights;</hi> and Anne's, <hi rend="italic">Agnes Grey</hi>. When <reg orig="com-|pleted">completed</reg>, <lb/>
the tales were sent to London. Charlotte's <lb/>
was rejected by several publishers; and her sisters', <lb/>
after various refusals, were only accepted on terms <lb/>
'impoverishing to their authors.' Charlotte, however, <lb/>
was encouraged to try a longer work in a more <lb/>
saleable form, and the very day that <hi rend="italic">The Professor</hi> <lb/>
was returned, <hi rend="italic">Jane Eyre</hi> was commenced. It was <lb/>
finished, accepted by Smith, Elder, &amp; Co., and <reg orig="pub-|lished">published</reg> <lb/>
in August 1847. Its success was instant and <lb/>
remarkable. Three editions were called for within <lb/>
<pb n="250" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0263"/>
a twelvemonth. A new genius had arisen, 'capable <lb/>
of depicting the strong, self-reliant, racy, and <reg orig="in-|dividual">individual</reg> <lb/>
characters which lingered still in the <lb/>
north.' This individuality of character and <reg orig="descrip-|tion">description</reg>, <lb/>
eulogised by Mrs Gaskell, constitutes the <reg orig="attrac-|tion">attraction</reg> <lb/>
and the value of the novel, for the plot is in <lb/>
many parts improbable, and some of the scenes are <lb/>
drawn with coarseness, though with piquancy and <lb/>
power. A masculine vigour and originality pervades <lb/>
the work. There was truth in the observation, that <lb/>
Jane Eyre was too like Richardson's 'Pamela' in <lb/>
her intercourse with her master, though the inherent <lb/>
indelicacy of such passages&mdash;of which the authoress <lb/>
was unconscious&mdash;was soon forgotten in the strong <lb/>
interest excited by Jane's misfortunes and moral <lb/>
heroism. Much of Charlotte's own history, down <lb/>
even to her <hi rend="italic">petite</hi> figure and plain face, is embodied <lb/>
in the story of the heroine. The authorship had <lb/>
been kept a secret. But when success was assured, <lb/>
Charlotte carried a copy of the novel to her father; <lb/>
he read it in his study, and at tea-time said: 'Girls, <lb/>
do you know Charlotte has been writing a book, and <lb/>
it is <hi rend="italic">much better than likely</hi>.' He had tried <reg orig="book-|making">bookmaking</reg> <lb/>
himself, but with very different powers and <lb/>
different results. In December 1847, <hi rend="italic">Wuthering <lb/>
Heights</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Agnes Grey</hi>, by Emily and Anne Bront&euml;, <lb/>
were published. The former had some strong <reg orig="delinea-|tion&mdash;a">delineation&mdash;a</reg> <lb/>
finished picture of a villain&mdash;but the effect <lb/>
was unpleasing. A second tale by Anne, <hi rend="italic">The Tenant <lb/>
of Wildfell Hall</hi>, is an improvement on the former <lb/>
work, and was more successful. Both of these <lb/>
novelists, however, were now fast sinking into the <lb/>
grave. Emily first declined, and Charlotte has told <lb/>
<pb n="251" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0264"/>
the melancholy sequel in a few brief but impressive <lb/>
words.</p>
<p>'Never in all her life had she &lpar;Emily&rpar; lingered <lb/>
over any task that lay before her, and she did not <lb/>
linger now. She sank rapidly. She made haste to <lb/>
leave us. Yet, while physically she perished, <reg orig="ment-|ally">mentally</reg> <lb/>
she grew stronger than we had yet known her. <lb/>
Day by day, when I saw with what a front she <lb/>
met suffering, I looked on her with an anguish of <lb/>
wonder and love. I have seen nothing like it; but, <lb/>
indeed, I have never seen her parallel in anything. <lb/>
Stronger than a man, simpler than a child, her <lb/>
nature stood alone. The awful point was, that <lb/>
while full of ruth for others, on herself she had no <lb/>
pity; the spirit was inexorable to the flesh; from <lb/>
the trembling hand, the unnerved limbs, the faded <lb/>
eyes, the same service was exacted as they had <lb/>
rendered in health. To stand by and witness this, <lb/>
and not dare to remonstrate, was a pain no words <lb/>
can render. Two cruel months of hope and fear <lb/>
passed painfully by, and the day came at last when <lb/>
the terrors and pains of death were to be undergone <lb/>
by this treasure, which had grown dearer and dearer <lb/>
to our hearts as it wasted before our eyes. Towards <lb/>
the decline of that day, we had nothing of Emily <lb/>
but her mortal remains as consumption left them. <lb/>
She died December 19, 1848 &lpar;in her thirtieth year&rpar;. <lb/>
We thought this enough; but we were utterly and <lb/>
presumptuously wrong. She was not buried ere <lb/>
Anne fell ill. She had not been committed to the <lb/>
grave a fortnight, before we received distinct <reg orig="intima-|tion">intimation</reg> <lb/>
that it was necessary to prepare our minds to <lb/>
see the younger sister go after the elder. <reg orig="Accord-|ingly">Accordingly</reg>, <lb/>
<pb n="252" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0265"/>
she followed in the same path with a slower <lb/>
step, and with a patience that equalled the other's <lb/>
fortitude. She was religious, and it was by leaning <lb/>
on those Christian doctrines in which she firmly <lb/>
believed that she found support through her most <lb/>
painful journey. I witnessed their efficacy in her <lb/>
latest hour and greatest trial, and must bear my <lb/>
testimony to the calm triumph with which they <lb/>
brought her through. She died May 28, 1849 &lpar;aged <lb/>
twenty-nine&rpar;.'</p>
<p>Charlotte alone was now left with the aged father, <lb/>
for Branwell, after sinking from vice to vice, had <lb/>
died the year before, in his thirty-first year. <reg orig="Liter-|ary">Literary</reg> <lb/>
labour was indispensable; and Charlotte <reg orig="com-|pleted">completed</reg> <lb/>
her tale of <hi rend="italic">Shirley</hi>, another series of Yorkshire <lb/>
delineations, fresh and vigorous as the former, and <lb/>
as well received by the public. It was published in <lb/>
1849. With the publication of <hi rend="italic">Shirley</hi> ended the <lb/>
mystery of the authorship. A Haworth man, <reg orig="resid-|ing">residing</reg> <lb/>
in Liverpool, read the novel, and recognised <lb/>
the localities and dialect; he guessed it to be Miss <lb/>
Bront&euml;'s, and communicated his discovery to a <reg orig="Liver-|pool">Liverpool</reg> <lb/>
paper, after which Miss Bront&euml; paid a visit <lb/>
to London, and the fact was made distinctly <lb/>
known. When in London, she met Thackeray. It <lb/>
was three years after this ere she appeared again <lb/>
as a novelist. Her experiences at the <hi rend="italic">pensionnat</hi> in <lb/>
Brussels, and the insight she had obtained into <lb/>
French character, suggested the subject of her next <lb/>
work, <hi rend="italic">Villette</hi>, which was published in 1853. In <lb/>
mere literary merit and skill of construction, it is <lb/>
superior to <hi rend="italic">Shirley</hi>, but it had not the same strong <lb/>
interest or air of reality. This was to be the last of <lb/>
<pb n="253" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0266"/>
Charlotte Bront&euml;'s triumphs. Her father's curate, <lb/>
Mr Nicholls, had entertained a deep and enduring <lb/>
attachment for her. The old minister was at first <lb/>
opposed to the match; but he at length yielded, and <lb/>
Charlotte was married in June 1854. A few months <lb/>
of happy wedded life brightened the close of her <lb/>
strange and sad career, in which she had displayed <lb/>
the virtues of a noble self-sacrificing nature, and she <lb/>
died March 31, 1855, in the thirty-ninth year of her <lb/>
age. Her first novel, <hi rend="italic">The Professor</hi>, was afterwards <lb/>
published, but it will not bear comparison with her <lb/>
other works. Her life was written by her friend, <lb/>
Mrs Gaskell, and there are short monographs by T. <lb/>
Wemyss Reid, A. M. F. Robinson, and Augustine <lb/>
Birrell.</p>

<figure id="f47" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0267" rend="block"/>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Harriet beecher stowe</hi>, authoress of <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Uncle Tom's Cabin</hi>, was born in the town <lb/>
of Litchfield, Connecticut, United States, <lb/>
June 14, 1812, being the sixth child of the Rev. <lb/>
Lyman Beecher, a poor preacher with a small salary <lb/>
and a large family. Her mother was obliged to eke <lb/>
out their slender income by keeping a select school <lb/>
where she taught French, drawing, painting, and <lb/>
embroidery, and the higher branches in English. <lb/>
She found time to play with and cultivate the <lb/>
intellect and imagination of her own children, <reg orig="how-|ever">however</reg>; <lb/>
she would make dolls for Harriet, and read <lb/>
to her and Henry Ward, the afterwards famous <lb/>
preacher of Brooklyn, from the works of Scott or <lb/>
Washington Irving. The little girl with brown <lb/>
curls and blue eyes, grew up in the companionship of <lb/>
Henry Ward, playing in the meadows and woods <lb/>
around her home.</p>
<p>She has preserved an odd incident of her <reg orig="child-|hood">childhood</reg>. <lb/>
Her mother, Roxana, was an enthusiastic <lb/>
horticulturist, as far as her limited means would <lb/>
allow, and her brother John in New York had sent <lb/>
her a small parcel of fine tulip bulbs. 'I remember,' <lb/>
writes Mrs Stowe, 'rummaging these out of an <lb/>
<pb n="255" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0268"/>
obscure corner of the nursery one day when she was <lb/>
gone out, and being strongly seized with the idea <lb/>
that they were good to eat, and using all the little <lb/>
English I then possessed to persuade my brothers <lb/>
that these were onions, such as grown people ate, <lb/>
and would be very nice for us. So we fell to and <lb/>
devoured the whole; and I recollect being somewhat <lb/>
disappointed in the odd, sweetish taste, and thinking <lb/>
that onions were not as nice as I had supposed.' On <lb/>
telling their mother what had been done, a gentle <lb/>
reproof was the result, and a picture of the gay <lb/>
flowers which had been lost to the garden for ever.</p>
<p>Harriet Beecher lost her mother in her fifth year: <lb/>
little Henry Ward, her brother, on being told that his <lb/>
mother was buried in the ground, and also that she <lb/>
had gone to heaven, was found digging with all his <lb/>
might in the garden, saying, 'I'm going to heaven <lb/>
to find ma.' Harriet for a time lived with an aunt <lb/>
and grandmother, but returned to the old home to <lb/>
the care of a stepmother. At seven she showed a <lb/>
very retentive memory: she read hard dry books of <lb/>
divinity far beyond her years. But she had an <lb/>
instinct for what was coloured with romance, and <lb/>
tinged with imagination. After digging and toiling <lb/>
for hours in a side closet full of pamphlets, she was <lb/>
rewarded by finding a portion of <hi rend="italic">Don Quixote</hi>, <lb/>
which to her at the time was like 'the rising of an <lb/>
enchanted island out of an ocean of mud.' Scott's <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Ivanhoe</hi>, followed, and she and her brother George <lb/>
read this through seven times. At school she showed <lb/>
considerable fondness for composition, and one of <lb/>
her essays, which was publicly read at the <reg orig="exhibi-|tion">exhibition</reg> <lb/>
at the close of the year, greatly pleased and <lb/>
<pb n="256" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0269"/>
interested her father, who was surprised and <lb/>
delighted when he heard that the authoress was <lb/>
his own daughter.</p>
<p>Catherine Beecher, the only sister of Harriet, had <lb/>
been engaged to Professor Fisher of Yale College, <lb/>
but he perished in the shipwreck of the <hi rend="italic">Albion</hi>. <lb/>
This was a terrible blow to the strong-minded young <lb/>
woman: though prostrated for a time she took up <lb/>
the study of mathematics and Latin in her <reg orig="twenty-|third">twenty-third</reg> <lb/>
year, went to Hartford, and was the chief agent <lb/>
in the founding of the Hartford Female Seminary. <lb/>
Harriet attended this institution in her twelfth <lb/>
year, and became a pupil-teacher. When Mr <lb/>
Beecher was appointed president of Lane <reg orig="Theo-|logical">Theological</reg> <lb/>
Seminary, Cincinnati, his daughters, Catherine <lb/>
and Harriet, went along with him, and there the <lb/>
sisters opened another school in the suburbs of <lb/>
that town. In her twenty-fifth year, in 1836, <lb/>
Harriet was married to Calvin E. Stowe, professor <lb/>
of biblical criticism and oriental literature in Lane <lb/>
Seminary.</p>
<p>About this time the question of slavery was hotly <lb/>
argued at Cincinnati, which being near the <reg orig="border-|line">borderline</reg> <lb/>
of Kentucky, slaves who had fled were helped <lb/>
from thence into Canada. The houses of free <lb/>
coloured people were burned, some were killed, and <lb/>
the discussion waxed so hot that life was in danger. <lb/>
Professor Stowe's family slept with firearms, and on <lb/>
the trustees of Lane Seminary forbidding that the <lb/>
subject be further discussed amongst the students, <lb/>
nearly the whole of them left the institution in a <lb/>
body. Dr Beecher collected money on behalf of the <lb/>
cause of the slaves; Mrs Stowe taught some of the <lb/>
<pb n="257" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0270"/>
coloured children in her own home. In 1850 <reg orig="Pro-|fessor">Professor</reg> <lb/>
Stowe removed to Bowdoin College, <reg orig="Bruns-|wick">Brunswick</reg>; <lb/>
boarders were taken into the home, and now <lb/>
and again Mrs Stowe earned something by her pen. <lb/>
Her sympathy lay with the poor slaves whom the <lb/>
Fugitive Slave Law was hunting back to their <lb/>
bondage, and fettered as she was with home duties, <lb/>
teaching, and the care of an infant, she longed to <lb/>
strike a blow for freedom. As she sat in church one <lb/>
day, at the Communion table, the plan of her famous <lb/>
story of <hi rend="italic">Uncle Tom's Cabin</hi> came into her mind, and <lb/>
she came home and wrote out the chapter containing <lb/>
an account of the hero's death. Some more chapters <lb/>
were written, and the story was offered to a <reg orig="news-|paper">newspaper</reg> <lb/>
called the <hi rend="italic">National Era</hi> issued at Washington. <lb/>
She read carefully upon the subject, and contributed <lb/>
her tale to this paper from week to week with a <lb/>
full heart. The story was published, March 20, <lb/>
1852. She had many misgivings about it, thought <lb/>
it would be a failure, and wondered if any one <lb/>
would care to read it. Copies of the book, when <lb/>
published, were sent to various persons in England, <lb/>
including Prince Albert, Macaulay, Dickens, and <lb/>
Charles Kingsley. A surprise awaited the busy <lb/>
authoress; ten thousand copies of her book were <lb/>
sold within ten days, and eight printing-presses had <lb/>
to be run night and day to keep up the demand. <lb/>
Within six months thirty different editions appeared <lb/>
in London; and over three hundred thousand copies <lb/>
were sold in less than a year. Within 1852 more <lb/>
than a million of copies had been sold in England, <lb/>
and it had been translated into Italian, Spanish, <lb/>
Danish, Swedish, Dutch, Flemish, German, Polish, <lb/>
<pb n="258" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0271"/>
and Magyar. It was dramatised in many forms, and <lb/>
acted in every capital of Europe, and in the free <lb/>
states of America. Prince Albert declared it to be <lb/>
worthy of any head and any heart that ever inspired <lb/>
a book; Charles Kingsley thought it was perfect. <lb/>
Lord Shaftesbury wrote a letter of sympathy, and <lb/>
sent an elaborate address from the women of <lb/>
England to the women of America to which 562, 448 <lb/>
signatures were appended. The address and <reg orig="signa-|tures">signatures</reg> <lb/>
were in twenty-six folio volumes, bound in <lb/>
morocco, in an oaken case, and were thus forwarded <lb/>
to Mrs Stowe. The popularity of her book brought <lb/>
her in money enough now for all her needs.</p>
<p>The visit which Professor Stowe and his gifted <lb/>
wife paid to England in 1853 was afterwards <reg orig="com-|memorated">commemorated</reg> <lb/>
in Mrs Stowe's <hi rend="italic">Sunny Memories in <lb/>
Foreign Lands</hi>. They received a splendid welcome <lb/>
in all the large towns; saw all the regulation sights, <lb/>
and a good deal of the best society. A penny <reg orig="offer-|ing">offering</reg> <lb/>
was made to her, from people of all ranks, which <lb/>
amounted to one thousand golden sovereigns. The <lb/>
Duchess of Sutherland presented her with a solid <lb/>
gold bracelet in the form of a slave's shackle, with <lb/>
the words: 'We trust it is a memorial of a chain <lb/>
that is soon to be broken.' It has now become a <lb/>
permanent memorial of the abolition of slavery: one <lb/>
link bears the date of the abolition of the <reg orig="slave-|trade">slavetrade</reg>, <lb/>
March 25, 1807; and of slavery in the English <lb/>
territories, August 1, 1834. On the other links <lb/>
are now engraved the dates of emancipation in <lb/>
Columbia; Lincoln's proclamation of the abolition <lb/>
of slavery in the states in rebellion, January 1, <lb/>
1863; and on the clasp its final abolition in the <lb/>
<pb n="259" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0272"/>
United States. It was something to be proud of in <lb/>
having helped forward such a blessed <reg orig="consumma-|tion">consummation</reg>. <lb/>
Her husband latterly held a professorship of <lb/>
sacred literature in the Theological Seminary at <lb/>
Andover, and died in 1886. Mrs Stowe has written <lb/>
quite a small library of volumes, many of which <lb/>
delineate the domestic life of New England of fifty <lb/>
or a hundred years ago, and all of which have found <lb/>
many readers. Mrs Stowe's home is at Hartford, <lb/>
but she spends the winter on her orange plantation <lb/>
in Florida.</p>
<p>On her seventy-first birthday, her publishers, <lb/>
Messrs Houghton, Mifflin, &amp; Co., gave a garden-party <lb/>
in her honour, when poets, statesmen, and reformers <lb/>
were present to do her honour. Mrs Stowe sat on a <lb/>
stage under a great tent, and heard the poems read <lb/>
and the speeches made. 'The brown curls,' says Mrs <lb/>
Bolton, 'had become snowy white, and the bright <lb/>
eyes of girlhood had grown deeper and more earnest. <lb/>
The manner was the same as ever, unostentatious, <lb/>
courteous, kindly. Her life is another confirmation <lb/>
of the well-known fact, that the best work of the <lb/>
world is done, not by the loiterers, but by those <lb/>
whose heart and hands are full of duties.'</p>
<p>A lady who visited Mrs Harriet Beecher Stowe, in <lb/>
her later life, at her home in Hartford, Connecticut, <lb/>
found her in feeble health. She writes: 'The dim <lb/>
gray eyes light up in conversation, however, and some <lb/>
sparks come from the pale lips now and again that <lb/>
impress one with what she must have been. Her <lb/>
manners have a more kindly than courteous air, and <lb/>
are tinted with the grace of modern as well as <reg orig="old-|time">oldtime</reg> <lb/>
custom. "Yes, my dear, I loved to write, and <lb/>
<pb n="260" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0273"/>
began very young," said Mrs Beecher Stowe. "I <lb/>
especially liked writing short stories when I lived in <lb/>
Brunswick, Maine. For these I used to get fifteen <lb/>
dollars, twenty dollars, twenty-five dollars&mdash;good pay <lb/>
in those times. I never thought of writing a book <lb/>
when I commenced <hi rend="italic">Uncle Tom's Cabin</hi>. I became <lb/>
first aroused on the subject of slavery when I lived <lb/>
in Cincinnati, and used to see escaping slaves come <lb/>
over the Ohio from Kentucky. Ah me! it thrills <lb/>
me even now, the sight of those poor creatures! <lb/>
Now a young girl, suggesting the lover, parent, or <lb/>
brother for whom her heart was breaking in bondage; <lb/>
again, the strong husband, aged father, or stalwart <lb/>
brother. Oh, I must write a story to stop the <reg orig="dread-|ful">dreadful</reg> <lb/>
shame! I kept putting it off, dreading bringing <lb/>
the characters to life, till the Fugitive Slave Law <lb/>
lashed me into fury, and I commenced what I <lb/>
meant to be a short story like the others. But it <lb/>
grew, and as it turned out, I was only full of wrath, <lb/>
and the story built itself around it as I wrote. A <lb/>
publisher was waiting for a story from me. I told <lb/>
him the subject I had undertaken. He wrote, <reg orig="say-|ing">saying</reg>: <lb/>
'You have struck a popular subject; for <lb/>
Heaven's sake keep it short.' I wrote in reply&mdash; <lb/>
'I shall stop when I get through&mdash;not before.' He <lb/>
never got it, for I had to make a book of it. While <lb/>
writing it I was filled with an enthusiasm which <lb/>
transfused my being, knew no hindrance, no rival <lb/>
interest, no belief but in writing it. I had young <lb/>
children, was keeping house and teaching school at <lb/>
the same time, and never worked so hard; but I <lb/>
had to write. Dinner had to be got, I knew. This <lb/>
had to be written, just as much&mdash;aye, and more, too. <lb/>
<pb n="261" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0274"/>
It was as though it was written through me, I only <lb/>
holding the pen. I was lifted off my feet. Satisfied? <lb/>
I never thought about being satisfied. When it was <lb/>
finished it was done, and relief came. I never felt <lb/>
the same with anything I afterward wrote. <hi rend="italic">Dred?</hi> <lb/>
Ah, yes; it was on slavery, too, but it was different. <lb/>

<head>ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">There</hi> is not much of incident to record in <lb/>
the life of the greatest poetess of modern <lb/>
times, Elizabeth Barrett, afterwards married <lb/>
to Robert Browning, the poet. Born at Carlton Hall, <lb/>
Durham, 6th March 1806, of wealthy parents, her <lb/>
father encouraged the genius which dwelt in that <lb/>
fragile form. She was the second daughter of <lb/>
Edward Moulton, and was baptised by the name of <lb/>
Elizabeth Barrett. Her father took the name of <lb/>
Barrett on succeeding to some property. Soon after <lb/>
the birth of the future poetess the family removed <lb/>
to Hope End, near Ledbury, in Herefordshire, where <lb/>
Mr Barrett had built himself a country house upon <lb/>
his own estate, with Moorish windows and turrets. <lb/>
As a child she was famed for her skill in rearing <lb/>
white roses. At the age of ten she began to write in <lb/>
rhyme, and her father indulged her so far as to print <lb/>
her epic, the <hi rend="italic">Battle of Marathon</hi>, composed in her <lb/>
fourteenth year. This girl with the pale spiritual face <lb/>
and dark curls had a happy childhood at Hope End, <lb/>
but a fall from her pony in her fifteenth year <lb/>
<pb n="263" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0276"/>
seriously injured her spine and made her an invalid <lb/>
for many years. At the age of seventeen she <reg orig="pub-|lished">published</reg> <lb/>
a didactic essay in heroics, after the manner of <lb/>
Pope. Owing to family circumstances the Barretts <lb/>
left Hope End, and settled at 74 Gloucester Place, <lb/>
London. Her favourite study was Greek, which <lb/>
she learned along with a beloved brother. Of a <lb/>
delicate constitution from her fall, she broke a <reg orig="blood-|vessel">bloodvessel</reg> <lb/>
on the lungs, and, while staying in <reg orig="Devon-|shire">Devonshire</reg> <lb/>
for the benefit of her health, another great <lb/>
calamity overtook her. This was the death by <reg orig="drown-|ing">drowning</reg> <lb/>
of her brother in Babbicombe Bay; three days <lb/>
elapsed before his body was recovered. This almost <lb/>
killed her, and left her utterly prostrate, and it <lb/>
was not until the year following that she could be <lb/>
removed to London. Miss Mitford, who knew her <lb/>
intimately at this time, remarks that 'she still clung <lb/>
to literature and to Greek; in all probability she <lb/>
would have died without the wholesome diversion <lb/>
of her thoughts..&hellip; She began the life which she <lb/>
continued for so many years confined to one large <lb/>
and commodious, but darkened chamber, admitting <lb/>
only her own affectionate family and a few devoted <lb/>
friends &lpar;I myself have often joyfully travelled <reg orig="five-|and-forty">fiveand-forty</reg> <lb/>
miles to see her, and returned the same <lb/>
evening without entering another house&rpar;, reading <lb/>
almost every book worth reading in every language, <lb/>
and giving herself heart and soul to that poetry of <lb/>
which she seemed born to be the priestess.'</p>
<p>Taine gives a passionate and laudatory notice <lb/>
of Mrs Browning in his <hi rend="italic">English Literature;</hi> and <lb/>
Edmund Clarence Stedman, the American critic, in <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Victorian Poets</hi>, finds her, with the exception of <lb/>
<pb n="264" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0277"/>
Sappho, the most inspired poetess of either ancient <lb/>
or modern times. A good deal of <hi rend="italic">Aurora Leigh</hi>, <lb/>
her longest poem, is autobiographical, and this <lb/>
is how she satisfied her hunger after knowledge in <lb/>
her youth: <lb/>
<q><lg type="stanza">
<l rend="indent">Books, books, books!</l>
<l>I had found the secret of a garret-room</l>
<l>Piled high with cases in my father's name.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>The first book first. And how I felt it beat</l>
<l>Under my pillow, in the mornings dark,</l>
<l>An hour before the sun would let me read</l>
<l>My books!</l>
<l>At last, because the time was ripe,</l>
<l>I chanced upon the poets.</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>The results of her classical studies were visible in <lb/>
a little volume issued in her twenty-sixth year, <hi rend="italic"><reg orig="Pro-|metheus">Prometheus</reg> <lb/>
Bound, and other Poems;</hi> this was followed <lb/>
by the <hi rend="italic">Seraphim, and other Poems</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic">Romaunt <lb/>
of the Page</hi>. A collection of her poems appeared <lb/>
in 1844, when she was in her thirty-fifth year: <lb/>
another collection appeared in 1850. The former <lb/>
volume contained an ambitious poem, the <hi rend="italic">Drama of <lb/>
Exile;</hi> the tale retold of <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Regained</hi>, <lb/>
which, like Bailey's <hi rend="italic">Festus</hi>, while containing fine <lb/>
passages, fails as a whole, and is chaotic in <reg orig="arrange-|ment">arrangement</reg>. <lb/>
But besides this ambitious poem, there were <lb/>
simpler strains which might come home to every one; <lb/>
amongst these being <hi rend="italic">Catarina to Camoens; Crowned <lb/>
and Wedded; Cowper's Grave; To Flush, my Dog; <lb/>
The Swan's Nest; The Cry of the Children</hi> &lpar;1843&rpar;, <lb/>
suggested by the report of the commissioners <lb/>
appointed to investigate the subject of the <reg orig="employ-|ment">employment</reg> <lb/>
of children; and <hi rend="italic">Lady Geraldine's Courtship</hi>.</p>
<pb n="265" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0278"/>
<p>With health restored her poetical life received a <lb/>
new impetus, and was crowned with unlooked-for <lb/>
happiness by her marriage, in 1846, to Robert <lb/>
Browning; and by the travel and residence in Italy <lb/>
which followed, together with the birth of a son &lpar;1849&rpar;. <lb/>
This union was a happy, rare, and perfect one, only <lb/>
broken by her death, after a week's illness at <lb/>
Florence, 30th June 1861. During the ten years <lb/>
which followed her marriage, she published <hi rend="italic">Casa <lb/>
Guidi Windows; Sonnets from the Portuguese</hi>, the
finest love sonnets in the English language, written <lb/>
before marriage, and which embalm her own love <lb/>
to her husband; and <hi rend="italic">Aurora Leigh</hi>, which contains <lb/>
twelve thousand lines of blank verse. The chief value <lb/>
of this poem, which fails as a novel in verse, is that <lb/>
it presents 'marvellous illustrations of the <reg orig="develop-|ment">development</reg>, <lb/>
from childhood on, of an &aelig;sthetical, <reg orig="imagina-|tive">imaginative</reg> <lb/>
nature.' <hi rend="italic">Napoleon III. in Italy</hi>, and one or two <lb/>
lyrics, amongst them that powerful one, <hi rend="italic">Mother and <lb/>
Poet</hi> were the after fruit of the closing years of the <lb/>
poetically-gifted Elizabeth Barrett Browning. Her <lb/>
son, now well known as a painter, was married to an <lb/>
American lady in 1887.</p>
<p>Miss Kate Field writes: 'Those who have known <lb/>
"Casa Guidi" as it was, can never forget the square <lb/>
anteroom with its great picture and pianoforte at <lb/>
which the boy Browning passed many an hour; the <lb/>
little dining-room covered with tapestry, and where <lb/>
hung medallions of Tennyson, Carlyle, and Robert <lb/>
Browning; the long room filled with plaster casts <lb/>
and studies, which was Mr Browning's retreat; and <lb/>
dearest of all, the large drawing-room where she <lb/>
always sat. It opens upon a balcony filled with <lb/>
<pb n="266" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0279"/>
plants, and looks out upon the old iron-gray church <lb/>
of Santa Felice.</p>
<p>'There was something about this room which <lb/>
seemed to make it a proper and especial haunt for <lb/>
poets. The dark shadows and subdued light gave it <lb/>
a dreamy look, which was enhanced by the <reg orig="tapestry-|covered">tapestrycovered</reg> <lb/>
walls and the old pictures of saints that <lb/>
looked out sadly from their carved frames of black <lb/>
wood. Large bookcases constructed of specimens of <lb/>
Florentine carving were brimming over with <reg orig="wise-|looking">wiselooking</reg> <lb/>
books. Tables were covered with more <lb/>
gaily-bound volumes, the gifts of brother authors. <lb/>
Dante's grave profile, a cast of Keats's face and brow <lb/>
taken after death, a pen-and-ink sketch of Tennyson, <lb/>
little paintings of the boy Browning, all attracted <lb/>
the eye in turn, and gave rise to a thousand musings. <lb/>
A quaint mirror, easy-chairs and sofas, and a hundred <lb/>
nothings, which always add an indescribable charm, <lb/>
were all massed in this room. But the glory of all, <lb/>
and that which sanctified all, was seated in a low <lb/>
arm-chair near the door. A small table strewn with <lb/>
writing materials, books, and newspapers, was always <lb/>
by her side.'</p>
<p>To this quotation Mrs Griswold adds: 'Here Mrs <lb/>
Browning held her small court, and here she <reg orig="enter-|tained">entertained</reg> <lb/>
in the course of those years many of the most <lb/>
famous men and women of her time. Almost all <lb/>
visitors to Florence, especially English and American, <lb/>
sought her acquaintance, and all were kindly received <lb/>
by her. The conversation was always earnest there; <lb/>
she demanded a great deal of a person&mdash;one felt it <lb/>
instinctively; and few came to waste her time upon <lb/>
trifles. Her own conversation was especially earnest, <lb/>
<pb n="267" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0280"/>
sometimes vivid, and lighted up by a humour <lb/>
peculiarly her own. She cared nothing for talk <lb/>
about people. Books and humanity, great deeds, and <lb/>
the great questions of the day, were the staple of <lb/>
her conversation. Religion, too, was an ever-present <lb/>
topic. She was one of the most religious women of <lb/>
her day, and she interwove it in all her conversation, <lb/>
as she did in her writings. Indeed, her religion was <lb/>
a part of herself, and whoever knew her must know <lb/>
of this strong, deep feeling. One cannot conceive of <lb/>
Mrs Browning apart from her religion. She would <lb/>
not have been herself, but another.'</p>
<p>On the walls of Casa Guidi a tablet has been placed <lb/>
to her memory, with this inscription: 'Here wrote <lb/>
and died <hi rend="small-caps">Elizabeth Barrett Browning</hi>, who to the <lb/>
heart of a woman joined the science of a scholar and <lb/>
the spirit of a poet, and who made with her verse <lb/>
a golden nuptial ring between Italy and England. <lb/>
Grateful Florence placed this memorial, 1861.'</p>

<head>JENNY LIND, THE SWEDISH NIGHTINGALE.</head>
<p>Madame Goldschmidt, better known by her maiden <lb/>
name of Jenny Lind, was the daughter of a teacher <lb/>
of languages at Stockholm, where she was born in <lb/>
1821. She showed an extraordinary disposition for <lb/>
music from her earliest infancy; at three years <lb/>
of age, she could sing correctly any piece she had <lb/>
once heard. At nine, she was admitted by the <lb/>
director to the School of Singing attached to the <lb/>
Court Theatre. Though wanting in personal <reg orig="attrac-|tion">attraction</reg> <lb/>
for a public or theatrical career, her name was <lb/>
entered at the Musical Academy, where she made <lb/>
great progress. She appeared repeatedly on the stage <lb/>
<pb n="268" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0281"/>
in the parts of little fairies until her twelfth year, <lb/>
when her voice, in the upper notes, lost its <reg orig="sweet-|ness">sweetness</reg>. <lb/>
Now she devoted her attention more to the <lb/>
theoretical and instrumental study of music. Herr <lb/>
Berg, a talented musician, became so much interested <lb/>
in her that he devoted much of his time to her <lb/>
advancement, giving her elementary lessons, and <lb/>
gradually initiating her in the school of the best <lb/>
classical authors.</p>
<p>Four years had elapsed, when at a public concert <lb/>
she undertook the music of 'Alice' in the fourth <lb/>
act of Meyerbeer's <hi rend="italic">Robert le Diable</hi>, when having <lb/>
recovered her high notes, she sang with so much fire <lb/>
and expression as to take her audience by storm. <lb/>
Another success awaited her in the part of 'Agatha' <lb/>
in <hi rend="italic">Freisch&uuml;tz</hi>, in her eighteenth year, to an <reg orig="over-|crowded">overcrowded</reg> <lb/>
house. For some time afterwards she <lb/>
attracted great crowds of admirers to the Royal <lb/>
Theatre, of which she was now the principal support. <lb/>
Her fame spread over Germany and France, and <lb/>
numerous offers were made for her services. She <lb/>
went to Paris and studied under Garcia and <reg orig="Meyer-|beer">Meyerbeer</reg>. <lb/>
After a short visit to Stockholm, what has <lb/>
been called her real period of glory began with her <lb/>
performance of <hi rend="italic">Norma</hi> at the Royal Opera House, <lb/>
Berlin, 15th December 1844. Every one was <reg orig="fasci-|nated">fascinated</reg>, <lb/>
and her successive representations continued <lb/>
to be popular. Her first appearance before a London <lb/>
audience was in May 1847, as 'Alice' in <hi rend="italic">Robert le <lb/>
Diable;</hi> her success was triumphant in <hi rend="italic">Sonnambula, <lb/>
La Figlia del Reggimento, Puritani</hi>, &amp;c. A more <lb/>
decisive victory than that of Jenny Lind was never <lb/>
known in the records of the Italian Opera, although <lb/>
<pb n="269" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0282"/>
her engagement was at first like to lead to litigation <lb/>
between two rival managers. After her London <lb/>
success came a brilliant tour in the provinces. In <lb/>
1848 she sang in a sacred oratorio, <hi rend="italic">Elijah</hi>, at Exeter, <lb/>
in connection with a concert for raising funds for a <lb/>
memorial to Mendelssohn.</p>
<p>Under the auspices of Mr P. T. Barnum, the <reg orig="well-|known">well-known</reg> <lb/>
showman, she visited New York in 1850. His <lb/>
offer to the great singer was more than &pound;200 for each <lb/>
concert, which sum was afterwards increased by one <lb/>
half of all the sums exceeding the nightly receipt of <lb/>
five thousand five hundred dollars. She is said to <lb/>
have made &pound;20,000 during this visit. Her American <lb/>
engagement was brought to a close, prematurely, in <lb/>
1851, by her marriage to M. Otto Goldschmidt, a <lb/>
skilful pianist and conductor, when she retired from <lb/>
the stage.</p>
<p>A well-informed writer sketches her appearance <lb/>
on her American tour. 'She was then in her <lb/>
thirtieth year, her features were irregular and could <lb/>
not be termed handsome, but her figure was <reg orig="well-|proportioned">wellproportioned</reg> <lb/>
and equally balanced between grace <lb/>
and dignity; in her eyes flashed the fire of genius, <lb/>
and when singing even the most difficult passages, <lb/>
there was a total absence of effort and of those <lb/>
distorting grimaces which so often impair the <reg orig="influ-|ence">influence</reg> <lb/>
of the best vocal power. When thus inspired, <lb/>
her whole face lighted up and became perfectly <lb/>
beautiful.</p>
<p>'I remember that at a concert at Natchez, on the <lb/>
Mississippi, when the steamer stopped to take fuel, <lb/>
she sang before an audience of about a thousand <lb/>
persons, composed of a small number of planters and <lb/>
<pb n="270" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0283"/>
their families, the great bulk being coloured people. <lb/>
There, as in another small place, Memphis, and at <lb/>
the unusual hour of eleven o'clock in the morning, <lb/>
she executed her solos with a finish and perfection <lb/>
which would have astonished the frequenters of Her <lb/>
Majesty's Theatre in London, or the Acad&eacute;mie de <lb/>
Musique in Paris. When I complimented her, and <lb/>
expressed my surprise that before so many who <lb/>
probably heard for the first time an artiste of her <lb/>
renown, and would have been satisfied with even an <lb/>
ordinary performance, she should have taken so <lb/>
much pains to do her very best, she replied: "I <lb/>
value my art much too highly to degrade it even <lb/>
occasionally by any wilful disregard of what I <reg orig="con-|sider">consider</reg> <lb/>
due to it." Here, then, is, in my opinion, the <lb/>
secret of her wonderful success. It is just that <lb/>
conscientiousness, that reverential feeling, which <lb/>
prompted her always to inspire even those who <lb/>
knew hardly anything of music with her ardour, and <lb/>
made them share her own emotion.'</p>
<p>Jenny Lind, in every country she visited, made <lb/>
large sums available for charitable institutions; along <lb/>
with her husband, she was instrumental in founding <lb/>
the Bach Choir, which had the privilege of her <lb/>
valuable services for training the female voices. <lb/>
Elected one of the professors of the Royal College of <lb/>
Music, she afterwards resigned. She had no vanity <lb/>
in the ordinary sense of the term, and was angry <lb/>
with Durham, the sculptor, for making too pleasant <lb/>
a bust of her. She said to him, 'I am an ugly <lb/>
Swede, and you have made me a pretty <reg orig="English-|woman">Englishwoman</reg>.'</p>
<p>In her later years she did not care to sing much, <lb/>
<pb n="271" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0284"/>
even in the semi-privacy of a crowded <reg orig="drawing-|room">drawing-room</reg>; <lb/>
but her voice retained its sweetness to the <lb/>
end. The last years of her life were largely taken <lb/>
up with works of charity, and few public singers <lb/>
have left behind them such a reputation among <lb/>
young musicians. One of the last of her profession <lb/>
to benefit by her encouragement and advice was <lb/>
Mademoiselle Sigrid Arnoldson, in whom she was <lb/>
specially interested on account of her Swedish <lb/>
nationality. Jenny Lind was also instrumental in <lb/>
bringing Sir Arthur Sullivan to the front. When <lb/>
the future composer was a chorister at the Chapel <lb/>
Royal, he got the Mendelssohn scholarship which <lb/>
was founded by her, and with that he went to <lb/>
Leipzig to receive a musical training.</p>
<p>Out of the proceeds of her singing tours, Jenny <lb/>
Lind had bought a piece of land on the Malvern <lb/>
Beacon, and built a residence there after the model <lb/>
of a Swedish residence with which she had been <lb/>
familiar in her young days. The view here was <lb/>
magnificent. She had also a house in London and <lb/>
another at Cannes. The Goldschmidts had returned <lb/>
from the Continent to London early in 1887, and in <lb/>
September the health of the great singer was so <lb/>
precarious as to give grave anxiety to her friends. <lb/>
She died at her residence near Malvern on the 2d <lb/>
of November, in her sixty-seventh year.</p>
<p>The moral character of Jenny Lind was without <lb/>
reproach. An extract from one of her letters throws <lb/>
an interesting light on her religious opinions. Once <lb/>
when she had just recovered from a long and severe <lb/>
illness, which had brought her to the brink of the <lb/>
grave, she wrote to Hans Christian Andersen, the <lb/>
<pb n="272" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0285"/>
well-known story-teller, to thank him for one of his <lb/>
books. 'The passage over to the other side,' she <lb/>
says, 'appeared to me so easy and so beautiful; the <lb/>
true home above, after which I was longing, seemed <lb/>
so heavenly, that everything earthly in me&mdash;all <lb/>
anguish, all grief, all the countless sufferings of a <lb/>
very sensitive soul, were hushed to rest. My soul <lb/>
was in such intimate communion with its Maker <lb/>
that it only longed to go home. But the Lord in <lb/>
His grace had appointed otherwise, and the <reg orig="re-|awakening">reawakening</reg> <lb/>
to life, with all its little cares, its miseries <lb/>
and restlessness, was not by any means a joy to the <lb/>
heart which was longing after the light of heaven <lb/>
and peace. &hellip; Yes, my esteemed friend, poetry, <lb/>
music, and art are three glorious revelations of the <lb/>
glorious God, and happy are we if we have dared to <lb/>
approach the throne of the Most High through the <lb/>
doors of true art and poetry. Life is uncertain for <lb/>
us all; I experienced that &lpar;feeling as to art, &amp;c.&rpar; <lb/>
when I was lying on a sick-bed; then it was that I <lb/>
felt it most strongly, and I cannot refrain from <lb/>
speaking it to those who are about me. &hellip; You <lb/>
are one of those who were sent across my path to <lb/>
strew it with the flowers of poetry whose perfume <lb/>
never fades, and will always have a place in my <lb/>
remembrance and my heart.'</p>
<p>Referring to her own remarkable career, she said: <lb/>
'We must remember that there is a still higher aim <lb/>
than art can give, and that the crucified Saviour will <lb/>
have our undivided heart; that all we possess&mdash; <lb/>
husband or wife, children, friends, brother and sister, <lb/>
parents, and art itself&mdash;must be loved in Him, and <lb/>
that the remarkable career I have had, and the <reg orig="won-|derful">wonderful</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="273" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0286"/>
times I received, flowed out of a clear fountain. <lb/>
My unceasing prayer is, that what I gave to my <lb/>
fellows may continue to live on through eternity, and <lb/>
that the Giver of the gift, and not the creature to <lb/>
whom He lent it, may be praised and acknowledged.' <lb/>
In the course of her letter, she adverts to her <reg orig="friend-|ship">friendship</reg> <lb/>
for Mendelssohn. 'I shall never forget the <lb/>
impression that Mendelssohn made upon me. All that <lb/>
I felt most deeply as an artist, all that I loved most <lb/>
purely and warmly in ideal as a human being, all that <lb/>
the heavenly gift of mine had whispered to my soul, <lb/>
found sympathy in him.' When on a visit to the <lb/>
Bishop of Norwich, A. P. Stanley wrote that 'her <lb/>
whole character and appearance is one of the most <lb/>
striking I ever saw&mdash;the manners of a princess, with <lb/>
the simplicity of a child and the goodness of an <lb/>
angel. &hellip; The features are plain and homely, far <lb/>
beyond what you would infer from her portraits; <lb/>
but when animated she is perfectly lovely, and her <lb/>
smile is, with the exception of Dr Pusey's, the most <lb/>
heavenly I ever beheld.' When she died, Jenny <lb/>
Lind left, as a heritage to the world, the fragrance <lb/>
and example of a noble and blameless life.</p>

<head>MRS CRAIK &lpar;DINAH MARIA MULOCK&rpar;.</head>
<p>The authoress of <hi rend="italic">John Halifax, Gentleman</hi>, <lb/>
daughter of a man of brilliant attainments, was <lb/>
born at Stoke-upon-Trent in 1826. Her mother, she <lb/>
thought, had been untenderly treated by her father, <lb/>
and the young Dinah, in a blaze of love and <reg orig="indigna-|tion">indignation</reg>, <lb/>
carried off the delicate and ailing mother and <lb/>
two younger brothers. She took the whole charge <lb/>
of supporting them on her own shoulders, and wrote <lb/>
<pb n="274" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0287"/>
stories for fashion books, as well as graver <reg orig="publica-|tions">publications</reg> <lb/>
for a livelihood. Mrs Oliphant made her <lb/>
acquaintance when she was a slim tall maiden, <lb/>
always surrounded by a band of ambitious and <lb/>
admiring girls. Her early life had been full of trial, <lb/>
and of that 'girlish and generous daring which makes <lb/>
a young, high-spirited woman the most dauntless <lb/>
creature in creation.' She sang sweetly and with <lb/>
great taste and feeling, and wrote poems for <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Chambers's Journal</hi>, in which one of her prose works <lb/>
also appeared. Dinah Maria Mulock made her first <lb/>
appearance as a novelist in 1849, with her story <hi rend="italic">The <lb/>
Ogilvies</hi>, followed during the next four years by <hi rend="italic">Olive, <lb/>
The Head of the Family</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Agatha's Husband</hi>. It <lb/>
was not, however, until the appearance of her novel, <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">John Halifax</hi>, in 1857, that her reputation was <reg orig="estab-|lished">established</reg> <lb/>
with the reading public. This book has been <lb/>
translated into French, German, Italian, Greek, and <lb/>
Russian, and the authoress had the pleasure of <lb/>
receiving from correspondents everywhere, assurances <lb/>
of the pleasure and profit received from its perusal.</p>
<p>She received the suggestion for the book which <lb/>
made her reputation in this way: One day in the <lb/>
summer of 1852, she drove over to Tewkesbury <lb/>
with Mr Clarence Dobell. Whenever she saw the <lb/>
medi&aelig;val houses of the High Street, and the Abbey, <lb/>
she decided that they should form the background <lb/>
of her story. A sudden shower drove them into <lb/>
a covered alley, and as they stood there a <reg orig="bright-|looking">brightlooking</reg> <lb/>
but ragged boy took refuge at the mouth of <lb/>
the alley. From the town-clerk's window a little <lb/>
girl gazed with looks of sympathy at the ragged boy <lb/>
opposite. Soon the door opened, and the girl <lb/>
<pb n="275" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0288"/>
appeared on the steps, and motioned to the boy to <lb/>
take a piece of bread. This forms, as most readers <lb/>
will remember, the opening scene in <hi rend="italic">John Halifax</hi>. <lb/>
When, thirty-four years after, Mrs Craik went to <lb/>
Tewkesbury, she found that it was visited by <lb/>
hundreds of people to identify the scenery of her <lb/>
most popular work. Two years after her first great <lb/>
success, appeared <hi rend="italic">A Life for a Life</hi>, considered by <lb/>
some to be even a better book. She was a contributor <lb/>
both in prose and verse to various journals at the <lb/>
beginning of her literary career, and no name was <lb/>
latterly more familiar as a writer in the domestic <lb/>
magazines. In 1864 she was awarded a pension of <lb/>
&pound;60 a year, in recognition of her services to <reg orig="litera-|ture">literature</reg> <lb/>
This sum she conscientiously set aside for the <lb/>
use of authors less fortunate than herself. She was <lb/>
married to Mr George Lillie Craik, one of the <lb/>
partners in the publishing firm of Macmillan &amp; Co., <lb/>
in 1865. She received at this time many letters and <lb/>
presents from entire strangers; none of these <reg orig="anony-|mous">anonymous</reg> <lb/>
gifts pleased her more, however, than a gold <lb/>
penholder, on which was inscribed, 'John Halifax.' <lb/>
Her death took place at her residence, the Corner <lb/>
House, Shortlands, Kent, on 12th October 1887.</p>
<p>The closing scene is thus pathetically described: <lb/>
'Her medical advisers had enjoined a great deal of <lb/>
rest, with which the pleasant cares of an <reg orig="approach-|ing">approaching</reg> <lb/>
marriage in the family, and all the necessary <lb/>
arrangements to make the outset of her adopted <lb/>
daughter in life as bright and delightful as possible, <lb/>
considerably interfered. In one attack of <reg orig="breath-|lessness">breathlessness</reg> <lb/>
and faintness some short time before, she <lb/>
had murmured forth an entreaty that the marriage <lb/>
<pb n="276" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0289"/>
should not be delayed by anything that could <lb/>
happen to her. But even this did not frighten the <lb/>
fond and cheerful circle, which was used to nothing <lb/>
but happiness. On the morning of the 12th of <lb/>
October, her husband, before going off to his business, <lb/>
took a loving leave of her, almost more loving than <lb/>
his wont, though without any presentiment, <reg orig="provok-|ing">provoking</reg> <lb/>
a laughing remark from their daughter, to which <lb/>
Mrs Craik answered that although long married <lb/>
they were still lovers. These were the last words <lb/>
he heard from her lips, and no man could have a <lb/>
more sweet assurance of the happiness his tender <lb/>
care had procured. When he came home cheerfully <lb/>
in the afternoon to his always cheerful home, the <lb/>
sight of the doctor's carriage at the door, and the <lb/>
coachman's incautious explanation that "the lady <lb/>
was dying," was the only preparation he had for the <lb/>
great and solemn event which had already taken <lb/>
place. He found her in her own room lying on a <lb/>
sofa with an awe-stricken group standing round&mdash; <lb/>
dead. She had entertained various visitors in the <lb/>
afternoon. Some time after they were gone she had <lb/>
rung her bell, saying she felt ill. The servants, <lb/>
alarmed, called for assistance, and she was laid upon <lb/>
the sofa. A few minutes' struggle for breath, a <lb/>
murmur, "Oh, if I could live four weeks longer, but <lb/>
no matter&mdash;no matter!" and all was over.'</p>
<p>Mrs Craik's house at Shortlands was purchased and <lb/>
furnished practically out of the proceeds of her most <lb/>
famous book. In the neighbourhood she was widely <lb/>
known and respected, and a friend has said of her <lb/>
that her good deeds only fell short of her good <lb/>
wishes. Her remains are buried at Keston <reg orig="Church-|yard">Churchyard</reg>, <lb/>
<pb n="277" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0290"/>
about three miles from Bromley. Mrs Craik's <lb/>
other novels and tales include <hi rend="italic">Mistress and Maid</hi> <lb/>
&lpar;1863&rpar;, <hi rend="italic">Christian's Mistake</hi> &lpar;1865&rpar;, <hi rend="italic">A Noble Life</hi> <lb/>

several volumes of essays, including <hi rend="italic">Studies from <lb/>
Life, A Woman's Thoughts about Women, Sermons <lb/>
out of Church</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Plain Speaking;</hi> a number of <lb/>
books for children, and a good deal of verse, much of <lb/>
which is collected in <hi rend="italic">Thirty Years' Poems</hi>, published <lb/>
in 1881. Two books of travel appeared in <hi rend="italic">The <lb/>

<head>LOUISA MAY ALCOTT.</head>
<p>What girl has not read or heard of the tales of <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Little Women</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Good Wives?</hi> and yet few know <lb/>
any particulars about the bright and busy career <lb/>
of the authoress. Her father was a well-known <lb/>
American educationist, a friend of Thoreau, Emerson, <lb/>
and Longfellow; her mother is described as a lovely <lb/>
woman. Louisa Alcott, the eldest of four sisters, was <lb/>
born at Germantown, Pennsylvania, November 29, <lb/>
1832. Her father, who for eleven years had been an <lb/>
earnest and successful teacher in Boston, had removed <lb/>
to Concord in 1839, where the young folks lived a <lb/>
very happy life in spite of their scanty means. The <lb/>
young authoress helped in producing real plays, and <lb/>
was fond of reading Shakespeare, Goethe, Emerson, <lb/>
<pb n="278" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0291"/>
Margaret Fuller, Miss Edgeworth, and George Sand. <lb/>
In her eighth year she penned an address <hi rend="italic">To a Robin</hi>, <lb/>
which her mother preserved, and for which she <lb/>
received some flattering words. Louisa Alcott, like <lb/>
many future story-tellers, showed an imaginative <lb/>
temperament, and would weave tales for her sisters <lb/>
and companions.</p>
<p>At sixteen she wrote a book called <hi rend="italic">Flower Fables</hi>, <lb/>
but this was not published until some years <reg orig="after-|wards">afterwards</reg>; <lb/>
she also began to teach in a school: fifteen <lb/>
years of her life were spent in teaching, which <reg orig="fur-|nished">furnished</reg> <lb/>
her with experiences to draw upon in her <lb/>
future books. She began to write in the evenings, <lb/>
and an early story appeared in print when she was <lb/>
nineteen, for which she received about one pound. <lb/>
She was better paid for some stories which she <reg orig="con-|tributed">contributed</reg> <lb/>
to a newspaper, and turned one of them, <lb/>
the <hi rend="italic">Rival Prima Donnas</hi>, into a drama, and <lb/>
meditated going on the stage. Here is a scrap of <lb/>
autobiography regarding this period in her own <lb/>
words, 'One of the memorial moments of my life,' <lb/>
she says, 'is that in which, as I trudged to school on <lb/>
a wintry day, my eye fell upon a large yellow poster <lb/>
with those delicious words, "<hi rend="italic">Bertha</hi>, a new tale by the <lb/>
author of the <hi rend="italic">Rival Prima Donnas</hi>, will appear in <lb/>
the <hi rend="italic">Saturday Evening Gazette</hi>." I was late; it was <lb/>
bitter cold; people jostled me; I was mortally afraid <lb/>
I should be recognised; but there I stood, feasting <lb/>
my eyes on the fascinating poster, and saying <lb/>
proudly to myself, in the words of the great Vincent <lb/>
Crummles, "This is fame." That day my pupils had <lb/>
an indulgent teacher; for, while they struggled with <lb/>
their pot-hooks, I was writing immortal works; and <lb/>
<pb n="279" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0292"/>
when they droned out the multiplication table, I was <lb/>
counting up the noble fortune my pen was to earn <lb/>
for me in the dim, delightful future. That <reg orig="after-|noon">afternoon</reg> <lb/>
my sisters made a pilgrimage to behold this <lb/>
famous placard, and finding it torn by the wind, <lb/>
boldly stole it, and came home to wave it like a <lb/>
triumphal banner in the bosom of the excited family. <lb/>
The tattered paper still exists, folded away with <lb/>
other relics of those early days, so hard and yet <lb/>
so sweet, when the first small victories were won, <lb/>
and the enthusiasm of youth lent romance to life's <lb/>
drudgery.'</p>
<p>Story after story now flowed from her pen. <lb/>
When the civil war began in America, Miss <lb/>
Alcott's heart was moved as Florence Nightingale's <lb/>
had been, at the sufferings of the poor soldiers, <lb/>
and now in her thirtieth year she offered herself <lb/>
&lpar;1862&rpar; as a nurse at the hospital for soldiers, <lb/>
Washington. She did her work among the wounded <lb/>
and dying soldiers bravely and nobly, and many a <lb/>
suffering life was cheered by her gentle <reg orig="ministra-|tions">ministrations</reg>. <lb/>
Her book entitled <hi rend="italic">Hospital Sketches</hi>, issued <lb/>
in 1865, contains much of the experience of this <lb/>
time. In the same year, needful of rest and change, <lb/>
she visited Europe as a companion to an invalid lady. <lb/>
In this way she spent a year in Germany, <reg orig="Switzer-|land">Switzerland</reg>, <lb/>
Paris, and London. Her father in 1868 had <lb/>
taken some of her collected stories to Roberts <lb/>
Brothers, the publishers, but received the reply, that <lb/>
they did not care just then for volumes of collected <lb/>
stories. Could his daughter not write them a story <lb/>
for girls in one volume? Miss Alcott, doubtful of her <lb/>
ability to do so, wrote <hi rend="italic">Little Women</hi>, a story of her <lb/>
<pb n="280" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0293"/>
three sisters and herself in their home at Concord. <lb/>
The writing of the first part occupied two months, <lb/>
and it was issued in October 1868. When the second <lb/>
part came out in April 1869, success was secured: <lb/>
and when <hi rend="italic">Little Men</hi> was announced, fifty thousand <lb/>
copies were ordered in advance. Other books have <lb/>
followed, <hi rend="italic">Shawl Straps, An Old-Fashioned Girl, <lb/>
Aunt Jo's Scrap-bag</hi>, &amp;c.; and she received &pound;20,000 <lb/>
from the sale of her books. She died at Concord, 6th <lb/>
March 1888. See her <hi rend="italic">Life and Letters</hi> by Cheney.</p>
<p>Her time was divided between Boston and Concord. <lb/>
Mrs Bolton, in her sketch of Miss Alcott, says, 'She <lb/>
never had a study: any corner will answer to write <lb/>
in. She is not particular as to pens and paper, and <lb/>
an old atlas on her knee is all the desk she cares for. <lb/>
She has the wonderful power to carry a dozen plots <lb/>
in her head at a time, thinking them over whenever <lb/>
she is in the mood. Often in the dead waste and <lb/>
middle of the night she lies awake and plans whole <lb/>
chapters. In her hardest-working days she used to <lb/>
write fourteen hours in the twenty-four, sitting <lb/>
steadily at her work, and scarcely tasting food till <lb/>
her daily task was done. When she has a story to <lb/>
write, she goes to Boston, hires a quiet room, and <lb/>
shuts herself up in it. In a month or so the book <lb/>
will be done, and its author comes out "tired, hungry, <lb/>
and cross;" and ready to go back to Concord to <lb/>
vegetate for a time.'</p>
<p>Her books have been as popular in England as in <lb/>
America, and 'her characters are drawn from life, <lb/>
and are full of the buoyant, free, hopeful New <lb/>
England spirit which marks her own enthusiastic <lb/>
love for nature, freedom, and life.'</p>

<head>DOROTHY PATTISON.<ref target="n1" n="1">*</ref>
<note id="n1" place="foot" n="1"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>Adapted from the <hi rend="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</hi>.</p></note>
</head>
<p>Dorothy Wyndlow Pattison was the daughter of <lb/>
the Rev. Mark Pattison, rector of Hauxwell, near <lb/>
Richmond, in Yorkshire, and sister of the late Mark <lb/>
Pattison, of Lincoln College, Oxford. She was born <lb/>
at Hauxwell in 1832. As a child she was very <lb/>
delicate, but on arriving at womanhood she became <lb/>
both beautiful and strong. The girl's splendid <lb/>
vitality and restless energy found some vent in <lb/>
following the hounds, but the common round of <lb/>
duties and pleasures in a country village was not <lb/>
enough to occupy her. Her wilfulness was strong, <lb/>
and, against her father's wishes, she went as mistress <lb/>
to a village-school. Afterwards, needing a wider <lb/>
range, and, feeling probably the necessity of <reg orig="work-|ing">working</reg> <lb/>
under some restraint, Miss Pattison became <lb/>
attached to the Protestant Sisterhood of the Good <lb/>
Samaritans. The rules of this body were of such a <lb/>
sort that here Sister Dora had to scrub floors, clean <lb/>
grates, and make beds. It was good for her, she <lb/>
said; but when on begging for leave to visit her <lb/>
dying father the request was denied, she greatly <lb/>
revolted against such an assertion of authority; <lb/>
and, though she worked under the Mother Superior <lb/>
for some years, 'the breach went on steadily, though <lb/>
imperceptibly, widening.'</p>
<p>It was at Walsall, as manager of an hospital, that <lb/>
the genius of this remarkable woman found its full <lb/>
expression. Her influence in that town became <reg orig="well-|nigh">wellnigh</reg> <lb/>
unbounded. There was nothing which she <lb/>
deemed it right to do that she ever shrank from <lb/>
<pb n="282" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0295"/>
doing. No form of disease, however loathsome, no <lb/>
accident, however repulsive, daunted Sister Dora. <lb/>
Almost and sometimes quite alone, she tended the <lb/>
patients of a temporary smallpox hospital, sitting <lb/>
up with sufferers day and night. On one occasion, <lb/>
when left alone in the place, a delirious patient in <lb/>
the worst stage of the disease threw himself <lb/>
out of bed and rushed to the door. The Sister <lb/>
grappled with him at once, got him back into <lb/>
the bed, and held him there by main force until <lb/>
the doctor arrived in the morning. 'It sounds <lb/>
almost incredible, but it is nevertheless a fact, that <lb/>
she was in the habit of bringing back to life &lpar;trying <lb/>
to bring back to life&rpar; patients who had sunk into <lb/>
the first stage of the fatal collapse which often <reg orig="pre-|cedes">precedes</reg> <lb/>
death from smallpox by putting her mouth <lb/>
to theirs and breathing into them until vitality <lb/>
was restored.' Her surgical skill was great, and so <lb/>
also was her courage in exercising it. On one <lb/>
occasion the surgeon declared it necessary that a <lb/>
man's arm should be amputated. The Sister thought <lb/>
otherwise, and undertook the responsibility of the <lb/>
case. She watched and tended 'her arm,' as she <lb/>
used to call it, almost literally night and day for <lb/>
three weeks, and the result was a cure. The man <lb/>
afterwards went by the name of 'Sister's Arm' in <lb/>
the hospital; and when she had a severe illness, he <lb/>
would walk eleven miles every Sunday morning to <lb/>
learn her condition. When the servant appeared <lb/>
in answer to his vigorous pull at the hospital bell, <lb/>
he eagerly inquired, 'How's Sister?' and when he <lb/>
had received his answer, said, 'Tell her that's her <lb/>
arm that rang the bell,' and walked back again. <lb/>
<pb n="283" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0296"/>
The Sister saved the doctor's work by setting <reg orig="frac-|tures">fractures</reg> <lb/>
and drawing teeth; and her bandaging was so <lb/>
good that a surgeon at Birmingham called upon his <lb/>
students to study as a model of excellence the <lb/>
bandaging of a man's head which was her <reg orig="handi-|work">handiwork</reg>. <lb/>
She seemed to delight in the exercise of her <lb/>
vast strength. If a patient fell out of bed, the <lb/>
Sister asked no one to help her, but picked him up <lb/>
and put him back again; and when a man died, she <lb/>
has been known to take up the body with apparent <lb/>
ease and carry it to the mortuary. Sister Dora had <lb/>
her faults, which are not concealed by her biographer, <lb/>
Miss Lonsdale. She felt her power, and it pleased <lb/>
her to exercise it unduly sometimes; she had strong <lb/>
prejudices, and could be intolerant; but the force of <lb/>
her character did not make her unwomanly. But <lb/>
no merely strong-minded woman could ever have <lb/>
exercised such an influence as hers. There was <lb/>
nothing merely masculine about her; she had a <lb/>
heart full of love and pity for all sorrow and <reg orig="suffer-|ing">suffering</reg>, <lb/>
and a faculty of enjoyment and sense of humour <lb/>
infinitely attractive. The warmth of feeling and <lb/>
glow of enthusiasm which stimulated the Sister's <lb/>
labours were occasionally more conspicuous than her <lb/>
judgment. Certainly she erred in using her strength <lb/>
unnecessarily, and 'her friends were disposed to <lb/>
think she was wanting in gratitude for that body to <lb/>
the beautiful form of which she undoubtedly owed <lb/>
no small measure of her success.' People who saw <lb/>
the calmness with which she assisted at operations <lb/>
might have deemed her unfeeling; but her sympathy <lb/>
was as strong as her courage, and all the warmth of <lb/>
her heart was expended on the poor people for whom <lb/>
<pb n="284" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0297"/>
she laboured. No woman ever lived a fuller life; <lb/>
but she did not believe that hospital nursing was a <lb/>
woman's highest vocation. 'Home,' she said, 'was the <lb/>
true sphere for woman;' and towards the end of her <lb/>
life she was heard to remark, 'If I had to begin life <lb/>
over again I would marry, because a woman ought <lb/>
to live with a man and be in subjection.' Many a <lb/>
man attributed his reformation from drunkenness <lb/>
and other vices to the teaching of this lady. None <lb/>
to whom she had once ministered were ever <reg orig="for-|gotten">forgotten</reg>, <lb/>
and all were afterwards welcome at the <lb/>
hospital, where, according to her biographer, they <lb/>
were sure of having a good laugh at any time. Since <lb/>
her death in 1878, a monument has been erected to <lb/>
her memory at Walsall. See <hi rend="italic">Sister Dora, a <lb/>
Biography</hi>, by Margaret Lonsdale &lpar;1880&rpar;.</p>

<head>JEAN INGELOW.</head>
<p>Jean Ingelow, widely known as a poet and <reg orig="novel-|ist">novelist</reg>, <lb/>
the author of <hi rend="italic">Divided</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Songs of Seven</hi>, since <lb/>
Mrs Browning passed away, ranks as the most <lb/>
eminent poetess of the day. When in London she <lb/>
resides in Kensington in a tasteful home, roomy, <lb/>
cheerful, and filled with flowers. The poetess has a <lb/>
fine womanly face, friendly manner, and cultivated <lb/>
mind. Her literary work is usually done in the <lb/>
forenoons; she likes to keep it long beside her in <lb/>
order to improve upon it and touch it up. As her <lb/>
health is never robust, her winters are usually spent <lb/>
in the south of France or Italy. But her first duty, <lb/>
apparently, has been to make two brothers&mdash;one of <lb/>
whom died in 1887&mdash;happy in the home. Born at <lb/>
Boston, Lincolnshire, in 1820, the daughter of a <reg orig="well-|to-do">wellto-do</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="285" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0298"/>
banker, she never experienced the struggle for <lb/>
independence which falls to the lot of so many <lb/>
women. Her lines had fallen in pleasant places; <lb/>
her mother was a cultivated woman from <reg orig="Aberdeen-|shire">Aberdeenshire</reg>, <lb/>
and she grew up to womanhood surrounded <lb/>
by eleven brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>From her own account of her childhood, we learn <lb/>
that she was very happy at times, and generally <lb/>
wondering at something. She was very like other <lb/>
children; and could remember of her mother pointing <lb/>
out a star to her and telling her about God who <lb/>
lived up there and made the star. At times certain <lb/>
ecstatic sensations of joy used to take possession of <lb/>
her, when she would creep into corners and think <lb/>
out thoughts by herself. She was very timid and <lb/>
full of fears, however. In her lofty nursery window <lb/>
which overlooked a river, a brother and herself were <lb/>
constantly wondering at the stream; the coming up <lb/>
of the tides, and the ships; the washing of the <lb/>
water with the sunshine upon it, and the reflections <lb/>
of the waves on the nursery ceiling, occupied their <lb/>
young minds. She has suffered much during life <lb/>
from a feeling of shyness and reserve, and has <lb/>
seldom been able to do things by <hi rend="italic">trying</hi> to do <lb/>
them. What inspiration has come to her in writing <lb/>
poetry has come of its own accord, and almost in spite <lb/>
of herself, and she has hardly any power, when <lb/>
verses have been once written, of making them any <lb/>
better. She saw the beauty in flower, and sky, and <lb/>
bird, was full of quick sympathy with the life <lb/>
around her, and to live rightly was to her the <lb/>
great problem of existence. Like Tennyson she <lb/>
has reflected the scenery of the fens or marshes <lb/>
<pb n="286" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0299"/>
reclaimed from the sea, a feature of part of <reg orig="Lincoln-|shire">Lincolnshire</reg>. <lb/>
She published a <hi rend="italic">Rhyming Chronicle of <lb/>
Incidents and Feelings</hi> in 1850, when she was <lb/>
twenty; a novel, <hi rend="italic">Allerton and Dreux</hi>, in 1851; and <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Tales of Orris</hi>, previous to the issue of her <hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> <lb/>
in 1863, which brought her fame and fresh friends. <lb/>
The volume bears a dedication to her brother, George <lb/>
K. Ingelow: 'Your loving sister offers you these <lb/>
poems, partly as an expression of affection, partly <lb/>
for the pleasure of connecting her effort with your <lb/>
name.' This book has gone through more than <lb/>
twenty editions in this country.</p>
<p>The press and the public welcomed her volume, <lb/>
and she took her place as one of the first of modern <lb/>
singers. Edmund Clarence Stedman, the American <lb/>
critic, -puts her claims very fairly when he says: 'As <lb/>
the voice of Mrs Browning grew silent, the songs of <lb/>
Miss Ingelow began, and had instant and merited <lb/>
popularity. They sprang up suddenly and tunefully <lb/>
as skylarks from the daisy-spangled, <reg orig="hawthorn-|bordered">hawthornbordered</reg> <lb/>
meadows of old England, with a blitheness <lb/>
long unknown, and in their idyllic underflights <lb/>
moved with the tenderest current of human life. <lb/>
Miss Ingelow may be termed an idyllic lyrist, her <lb/>
lyrical pieces having always much idyllic beauty. <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">High Tide on the Coast of Lincolnshire, Winstanley, <lb/>
Songs of Seven</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic">Long White Seam</hi>, are <lb/>
lyrical treasures, and the author especially may <lb/>
be said to evince that sincerity which is poetry's <lb/>
most enduring warrant.'</p>
<p>Jean Ingelow has also published some delightful <lb/>
prose works. Her <hi rend="italic">Studies for Stories</hi>, issued in <lb/>
1864, has been called prose poetry carefully thought <lb/>
<pb n="287" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0300"/>
out. <hi rend="italic">Stories told to a Child</hi> came in 1865; and in <lb/>
1868 another volume of poems, <hi rend="italic">A Story of Doom</hi>. <lb/>
These have been followed by <hi rend="italic">Mopsa, the Fairy; A <lb/>
Sister's By-Hours, Off the Skelligs</hi>&lpar;1872&rpar;,<hi rend="italic">Fated to <lb/>
be Free</hi>&lpar;1875&rpar;,<hi rend="italic">Sarah de Berenger</hi>&lpar;1879&rpar;,<hi rend="italic">Don John</hi> <lb/>
&lpar;1881&rpar;, and <hi rend="italic">Poems of the Old Days and the New</hi>. <lb/>
Jean Ingelow has an appreciative band of readers <lb/>
in England, and in America one hundred thousand <lb/>
copies of her <hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> are said to have been sold. <lb/>
She has endeavoured to be of service to the world <lb/>
in other ways. She at one time instituted what <lb/>
was called a copyright dinner, because it was a free <lb/>
dinner for the sick poor, paid out of the money she <lb/>
received from her books. She had about twelve <lb/>
poor folks just out of the hospitals, who were not <lb/>
strong enough for work, three times a week. It is <lb/>
good to know that this true woman and true poet <lb/>
is very fond of children, and does not think herself <lb/>
too old or too wise to sympathise with them in <lb/>
their thoughts, and joys, and troubles.</p>

<div2 type="chapter" id="d36">
<head>MARY CARPENTER.</head>
<p>Mary Carpenter's days even from early youth <lb/>
were devoted to philanthropic labours. The daughter <lb/>
of an Unitarian minister of Bristol, she was born <lb/>
at Exeter, April 3, 1807. She was trained as a <lb/>
teacher and afterwards became a governess. When <lb/>
but a few years old, the child said that 'the good <lb/>
God had given her a great deal of love.' In early <lb/>
years she gained much solid culture, and, like <lb/>
many young persons of warm feelings and lively <lb/>
fancy, gave utterance to her emotions in verse. <lb/>
Oddly enough, she expressed a disgust for the <lb/>
<pb n="288" entity="Cochrane_LivesofGood_0301"/>
'passion' of some of Mr Tennyson's earlier poems; <lb/>
and it is probable that Wordsworth, whom she <lb/>
greatly admired, was loved less for the sake of his <lb/>
art than for the moral aim of his verse. Before <lb/>
entering on her great work as a social reformer, <lb/>
Mary Carpenter passed through a long period of <lb/>
spiritual conflict. She began to take an active part <lb/>
in the movement for the reformation of neglected <lb/>
children, and besides advocating their cause in her <lb/>
writings, she founded several reformatories for <lb/>
girls, one of which, the Red Lodge Reformatory, she <lb/>
personally superintended. She founded in 1835 <lb/>
a working and visiting society, of which she was <lb/>
secretary for more than twenty years. She gave <lb/>
evidence before a parliamentary committee as to <lb/>
juvenile delinquency in 1852, and founded a ragged <lb/>
school in the worst part of Bristol. By degrees <lb/>
her name became known and honoured throughout <lb/>
England; and when, in the last decade of her life, <lb/>
she devoted herself to the elevation of women in <lb/>
India, she received the heartiest welcome from the <lb/>
chief authorities of the empire. Mary Carpenter's <lb/>
four visits to India were fruitful of good works. <lb/>
She had an interview with the Queen in 1868 in <lb/>
connection with her work. Her plan of <reg orig="day-|feeding">dayfeeding</reg> <lb/>
