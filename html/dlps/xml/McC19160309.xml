            <salute>Dear Marcelle:</salute>
        		</opener>
        		
            <p>
            Your very welcome
            letter of the 6th I received
            this noon.  You’re a peach
            Marcelle &mdash; a dear to write me
            as you do.  I wish I had
            more time to write to you
            for its one of my great
            pleasures.
            </p><p>
            Yes I’m slated for
            the Nieufort all right &mdash; if I
            don’t do again as I did to
            day.  Vidart told me I would
            pass from the Moran to morrow
            and to make a short trip as
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0255" n="[p.2]"/>
            
            a wind up.  On landing
            I over &mdash; reached and came
            sailing in just missing
            two machines.  I was called
            down and told to go again.
            That time I saw I was 
            getting near and tho [sic] I
            had nearly reached the 
            ground I decided to
            put on the motor again
            and make another try.  I
            did not look to the right
            or left for an outlet I 
            could have veered to but
            kept straight ahead.  I
            looked suddenly upward.  My
            God there were the trees
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0254" n="[p.3]"/>
            
            bordering the road.  There
            was nothing left to do
            but to try and get
            over them &mdash; but I was so
            close.  I pulled on the
            machine and shot up &mdash;
            a thing one is forbidden
            to do because of the danger.
            The trees were coming closer
            and they were always above
            me.  I was very close
            now and saw the top of
            one just in front.
            "Good night" said I and
            wondered where I’d crash
            down.  Then I wondered
            why the wheels didn’t
            touch and pitch me forward.
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0256" n="[p.4]"/>
            
            Then I knew I had crossed
            them and was going up
            to a safe altitude.  I caught
            the devil on coming down.
            I had missed the tree top
            by fifty centimeters.  Now I'll
            have to stay on the Moran
            a couple of days longer,
            even tho [sic] I did make another
            trip, a perfect atterrissage,
            and Vidart said I was
            once more "Mon bon Mac Connell"
            </p><p>
            Yes the Nieufort is what
            I’ve always wanted.  The only
            trouble is that they make
            one go through so much
            training that I’ll be longer
            getting to the front.  I
            do not want to go in
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0257" n="[p.5]"/>
            
            the American crowd, but may
            have to.
            </p><p>
            Rumsey finally showed 
            up.  He has been given
            fifteen days jail in the
            infantry prison of Pau.  He
            may be able to save himself
            because of Prince’s pull with
            the Captain.  He has eight
            days dalle de police in
            addition because a man stole
            his snow boots and he
            cannot account for them.
            </p><p>
            I inclose [sic] the photos.
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0259" n="[p.6]"/>
            
            Lord but that’s the
            limit that your father
            chanced to run into us
            as we were getting into
            the taxi.  Of course he’s
            figured it out as well
            as your mother, but its
            fine of you to hide it
            as you have Marcelle.  
            </p><p>
            By the way would you rather
            have me address letters to 
            you at the Ambulance?
            If I’m taboo with your
            father and mother maybe
            it might embarrass you
            to have my letters go to
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0258" n="[p.7]"/>
            
            your home.
