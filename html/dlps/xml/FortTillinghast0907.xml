<p>
It is sabbath they say<lb/>
yet we do not realize it this morn<lb/>
I have not heard <add place="top" hand="author">the</add> Bell calling<lb/>
to worship &mdash; but in its place<lb/>
I have heard all day &lpar;it is now<lb/>
about 3 Oclock&rpar; the tramp of armed<lb/>
men.  the rattle of Artillery and<lb/>
Baggage by this fort &mdash; I was<lb/>
on guard yesterday and last<lb/>
night and a Main Regt. near<lb/>
the fort were buisy most all<lb/>
the night in getting ready and<lb/>
starting off for the Potomac &mdash; but<lb/>
<unclear>[letter lined out]</unclear> my last beat just after light<lb/>
it seemed so still and pleasant a <lb/>
soft mild wind blowing from<lb/>
the South it realy for a while<lb/>

<pb entity="DSSR_000002759_0036" n="[page 2]"/>
	
did seem like a sabbath <del hand="author" rend="line-through">moin</del> <add place="top" hand="author">morn</add><lb/>
&mdash; But soon a cloud of dust begun<lb/>
to rise away on the road and<lb/>
a Brigad came in sight marching<lb/>
for where and what we only guess<lb/>
&mdash; I suppose you now are about<lb/>
eating your Sabbath meal I tell you<lb/>
I should like to be there about<lb/>
this time.  I would like to have<lb/>
a good cup of tea and a piece<lb/>
of pie <unclear>[-]</unclear>  We Boys often speak<lb/>
of home and the folks &mdash; but it is<lb/>
the oftnest we speak of home<lb/>
when we are <hi rend="underline">eating our rations</hi><lb/>
&mdash; We live now in very good shape<lb/>
we have soft Bread most of the time<lb/>
now but when on our march it was<lb/>
that hard pilot stuff and most of<lb/>
the regt in the field active service<lb/>
it is about all they get &mdash; The regt.<lb/>
that are at forts as garrison have<lb/>
good living to what those in<lb/>
the field get &mdash; for it is

<pb entity="DSSR_000002759_0037" n="[page 3]"/>
	
impossible to carry much of this<lb/>
soft Bread &mdash; &mdash; I should like<lb/>
to look in on you &mdash; come in<lb/>
and throw myself on the loung and<lb/>
then go and play a time on the<lb/>
serephim &mdash; but these are in the<lb/>
future when we get this rebelion<lb/>
put under the sod &mdash; It looks<lb/>
rather dark now with our army<lb/>
all back where they were a year<lb/>
ago all back here under the guns<lb/>
of these forts but still I think<lb/>
we are not any worse off than<lb/>
a year ago and we have a much<lb/>
better navy &mdash;While the rebels are<lb/>
worse off in the loss of men that<lb/>
they cannot replace &mdash; We have loss many<lb/>
men but we can and shall replace them<lb/>
our side seems ready to find more men<lb/>
after they have <del hand="author" rend="line-through">been</del> spilled there blood<lb/>
like water that officers might have<lb/>
a chance to win a name &mdash; but<lb/>
which they have not done &mdash; I do

<pb entity="DSSR_000002759_0038" n="[page 4]"/>
	
hope
</p>
<p>
we shall yet find a man that<lb/> 
is able to lead us through this<lb/>
red-sea &mdash;  I see men every day<lb/>
that have been out in these <add place="top" hand="author">late</add> fights<lb/>
under McDougall and Pope and they are<lb/>
discouraged and say they will not<lb/>
fire another gun under such leaders<lb/>
but of course they will have to fight<lb/>
where they are sent = We meet very<lb/>
often some of the Boys that went<lb/>
from Dudley and around there<lb/>
we saw a day or two ago W. Taylor<lb/>
and Geo Allen they look quite hearty<lb/>
and strong &mdash; but say they have seen<lb/>
some hard times and all that<lb/>
have come out here say <del hand="author" rend="line-through">they</del> the<lb/>
same &mdash; But all wish to stay and<lb/>
see it through &mdash; though they would<lb/>
like to see it through soon &mdash;
</p>
<p>
Johnson has just got a letter<lb/>
from home he says they write you have<lb/>
not heard from me &mdash; I don't know<lb/>
how it is for Ellen wrote she had<lb/>
got a letter and I understood her<lb/>
that you had got my letters any<lb/>
way I have wrote 3 or 4 and have<lb/>
got one from John and one from Mother<lb/>
but I guess you have before this got<lb/>
them &mdash; I suppose <del hand="author" rend="line-through">you</del> things in<lb/>
old Dudley look rather dull but they<lb/>
must expect things to be dull till<lb/>
this war is over &mdash; But things here<lb/>
are lucky enough &mdash; But does it<lb/>
pay &mdash; I think it will pay if<lb/>
our government only will get in<lb/>
ernest and I think it will be<lb/>
