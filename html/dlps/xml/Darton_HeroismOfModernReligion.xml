<p>A very attractive and useful book for young readers is "<hi rend="italic">Leaders of <lb/>
Men</hi>," a book of biographies, by H. A. Page. Externally it is one of <lb/>
the handsomest of volumes, printed on heavy paper, in clear type, <lb/>
and beautifully bound. Internally it is made up of well-written <reg orig="bio-|graphical">biographical</reg> <lb/>
sketches of the Prince Consort, Robert Dick, baker and <lb/>
geologist, Commodore Goodenough, George Moore, John Duncan, <lb/>
weaver and botanist, Samuel Greg, Dr. John Wilson, Dr. Andrew <lb/>
Reed, and Lord Lawrence. It abounds in incidents in the lives of the <lb/>
prominent men of whom it treats, points out the principles which <reg orig="actu-|ated">actuated</reg> <lb/>
them and the successes they attained. The boy who reads the <lb/>
volume will be stimulated to a desire for a broader acquaintance with <lb/>

<p>Biography is one of the most attractive forms of literature, and the <lb/>
recorded lives of the great and good are sermons that powerfully do <lb/>
their own preaching, and win many to follow their example. The <lb/>
lives of eleven notable women are included in the present volume. <lb/>
Among them are Mary Somerville, Lady Duff Gordon, Charlotte <lb/>
Elliott, Baroness Bunsen, Catharine Tait, and Maria Louisa <reg orig="Charles-|worth">Charlesworth</reg>. <lb/>
No better book for girls could be placed in their hands. We <lb/>

&lsqb;<hi rend="small-caps">patroness of children's homes and hospitals.</hi>&rsqb;</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Amongst</hi> all the nine children of her Majesty, <lb/>
not the least conspicuous and esteemed for her <lb/>
"going about doing good" is the exalted subject of <lb/>
this memoir. It would be needless to say what is so <lb/>
well known to all, that the royal family have been <lb/>
scrupulously trained in their moral as well as mental <lb/>
life. And the nation now in many ways, direct and <lb/>
indirect, have occasion to honour every member of it. <lb/>
Her Majesty herself was trained by her royal mother, <lb/>
the Duchess of Kent, with the most anxious solicitude <lb/>
for her religious and intellectual well-being; and the <lb/>
Queen, in the training of her children, has ever had <lb/>
her mother before her as an example, coupled with the <lb/>
good help in this respect she received from the Prince <lb/>
Consort, whose wisdom and goodness of heart elicited <lb/>
the admiration of the whole nation.</p>
<pb n="2" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0019"/>
<p>In such a well-ordered home as the Princess Louise <lb/>
was trained, it would indeed have been surprising if she <lb/>
had grown up without those accomplishments and <lb/>
virtues of heart and mind which she so pre-eminently <lb/>
possesses. As far as her exalted rank and station would <lb/>
allow, she was always with the poor either in private <lb/>
or public; and when but recently she left her mother <lb/>
country to accompany her husband, the Marquis of <lb/>
Lorne, to Canada, she left with her country's <reg orig="bless-|ings">blessings</reg>.</p>
<p>The Princess Louise was born in May, 1848, about <lb/>
nine months after the following pretty incident, <reg orig="refer-|ring">referring</reg> <lb/>
to the Marquis of Lorne, related by her Majesty <lb/>
in her "Journal of our Life in the Highlands," which she <lb/>
has kindly and wisely published for her loving people <lb/>
to read, and which has increased the esteem for her <lb/>
and her late husband in the minds of all judicious <lb/>
and generous readers:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Our reception in Inverury was in the true Highland <lb/>
fashion. The pipers walked before the carriage, and <lb/>
the Highlanders on either side, as we approached the <lb/>
house. Outside stood the Marquis of Lorne, just two <lb/>
years old, a <hi rend="italic">dear, white, fat, fair little fellow</hi>, with <reg orig="red-|dish">reddish</reg> <lb/>
hair, but very delicate features, like both his father <lb/>
and mother. He is such a merry, independent little <lb/>
child. He had a black velvet dress and jacket, with a <lb/>
'sporian,' scarf, and Highland bonnet." The Queen, <lb/>
on ascending the steps, recognised the youthful <reg orig="Mar-|quis">Marquis</reg> <lb/>
of Lorne, a graceful child, then about three years <lb/>
<pb n="3" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0020"/>
old; her Majesty stooped down and took the little <lb/>
fellow by the hand, and lifted him up and kissed him. <lb/>
And this same boy was destined to be the future <lb/>
husband of a then unborn daughter of her Majesty, <lb/>
the Princess Louise.</p>
<p>We cannot do more honour to the Princess Louise <lb/>
than by giving in connection with herself the following <lb/>
particulars of her husband, the son and heir of the <lb/>
Duke of Argyll:&mdash;</p>
<p>"The Marquis of Lorne, born in the year 1844, <lb/>
made himself favourably known to the English reading <lb/>
public, in 1867, by a volume called 'A Trip to the <lb/>
Tropics,' in which he gave an account of his visit to <lb/>
the West Indies and the United States. It was in <lb/>
January, 1866, that he went out, in company with Mr. <lb/>
Arthur Strutt. He stayed nine days in Haiti, a month <lb/>
in Jamaica, and looked in at Havannah. The inquiry <lb/>
then going on with regard to the alleged cruelty and <lb/>
iniquity of the Colonial Government in the <reg orig="suppres-|sion">suppression</reg> <lb/>
of the negro revolt at Morant Bay led him to see <lb/>
more of the country, and to hear more of its actual <lb/>
condition, than he might otherwise have done. He <lb/>
met Governor Eyre, whose motives he esteemed good; <lb/>
but he found cause to believe that the negro peasantry <lb/>
suffered from a bad administration, and he could not <lb/>
approve of the illegal severities practised under martial <lb/>
law. Writing, as he did, before the report of the <lb/>
Royal Commission, the opinions formed by this young <lb/>
nobleman, amidst conflicting reports of excited <reg orig="parti-|sans">partisans</reg>, <lb/>
<pb n="4" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0021"/>
were such as did credit to his judgment and to his <lb/>
candid desire of truth. It is interesting to observe <lb/>
that the slightly contemptuous tone in which <reg orig="thought-|less">thoughtless</reg> <lb/>
Englishmen are apt to speak of the coloured races, <lb/>
as 'niggers,' and so forth, though it might have been <lb/>
encouraged by witnessing the wretched state of Haiti, <lb/>
was corrected by his interview with an educated black <lb/>
gentleman such as President Geffrard. Lord Lorne <lb/>
'made his own reflections,' a few days afterwards, <lb/>
upon meeting a party of 'haw-haw' British officers, who <lb/>
said to him, 'Fancy a black republic! Haw, haw! <lb/>
I always feel inclined to knock a nigger down when <lb/>
he's impudent; and what they must be when they're <lb/>
free, like that, I'm sure I don't know.' The Marquis, <lb/>
on hearing this sensible remark, confesses that he <lb/>
'remembered the courtesy and refinement of President <lb/>
Geffrard's conversation.' There are many similar <lb/>
traits of a just and generous spirit in his book, without <lb/>
any enthusiastic delusion of philanthropy and universal <lb/>
liberty, but exempt from the prejudices and groundless <lb/>
antipathies in which some of our youth grow up. He <lb/>
was disposed, when in the United States, a <reg orig="twelve-|month">twelvemonth</reg> <lb/>
after the close of the Civil War, to recommend <lb/>
a conciliatory treatment of the South, to respect the <lb/>
patriotism of its defeated leaders, and to look <reg orig="hope-|fully">hopefully</reg> <lb/>
on the prospect of the country after emancipation. <lb/>
Yet he deals more in reports of what was said to <lb/>
him by good local informants than in theories or <reg orig="con-|jectures">conjectures</reg> <lb/>
of his own; and he was freely admitted, of <lb/>
<pb n="5" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0022"/>
course, to the best American society, both in the South <lb/>
and in the North. Ten days at New York, and the <lb/>
same time at Boston, with a visit to Harvard <reg orig="Univer-|sity">University</reg>, <lb/>
the acquaintance of Everett and Longfellow, and <lb/>
a lecture from Emerson, were followed by an equal <lb/>
sojourn at Washington, the sight of Congress in session, <lb/>
an introduction to President Johnson, and instructive <lb/>
talk with General Grant, Mr. Seward, and other chief <lb/>
politicians of the Union. He then made a tour in <lb/>
Virginia, found the city of Richmond still in ruins, <lb/>
heard many anecdotes and expressions of feeling on <lb/>
the Confederate side, accepted the hospitality of <lb/>
planters, and saw the habits of the negroes, the <reg orig="imme-|diate">immediate</reg> <lb/>
effects of their release from slavery, the schools <lb/>
and other beneficial agencies established by the <reg orig="Freed-|men's">Freedmen's</reg> <lb/>
Bureau. His affability and wish to gather <reg orig="know-|ledge">knowledge</reg> <lb/>
of mankind are proved by talks with <reg orig="fellow-|passengers">fellow-passengers</reg> <lb/>
on steamboats, with dusky-skinned labourers <lb/>
in the fields of the South, with hosts of rustic inns, <lb/>
and even with Irish waiters in the hotel at New York, <lb/>
whom he slyly provoked to discuss their hopes of the <lb/>
Fenian conspiracy, while assuring them it could never <lb/>
succeed. A short stay in Baltimore, where he listened, <lb/>
by a lady's pianoforte, to the Secession song 'My <lb/>
Maryland,' was the last of his tour in the States; and <lb/>
it would be advantageous were all our countrymen, <lb/>
whether of the aristocratic, the commercial, or the <lb/>
professional and literary class, to see both Massachusetts <lb/>
and Virginia with the same friendly eyes. The <reg orig="Mar-|quis">Marquis</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="6" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0023"/>
did not see the Great West, but hastened by <lb/>
Niagara to the British provinces, of which he tells us <lb/>
little, only touching upon the outward aspects o <lb/>
Toronto, Kingston, and Ottawa. His narrative is <lb/>
neatly compiled from letters sent home during his <lb/>
journey. But it is as an exhibition of his mind and <lb/>
temper, which all the Queen's subjects, or friends of <lb/>
the royal family, must be pleased to observe in the <lb/>
book. It displays no remarkable cleverness, but much <lb/>
good sense and good feeling, the observant shrewdness <lb/>
of a Scotchman, a sober judgment of men and things, <lb/>
and a lively sense of humour. With these mental <lb/>
endowments, the Marquis of Lorne had so early gained <lb/>
a respectable position in the literary world."</p>
<p>Subsequently to the publication of this volume, the <lb/>
Marquis of Lorne became a man of mark, and when <lb/>
his betrothment to the Queen's daughter the Princess <lb/>
Louise became known, there were a variety of opinions <lb/>
expressed, all turning upon the question of social <reg orig="dis-|tinctions">distinctions</reg>. <lb/>
The aristocracy were opposed to it, as well <lb/>
as some members of the Court. But her Majesty and <lb/>
the Princess herself were well satisfied in the choice, and <lb/>
nothing more was to be said. Truly it was an alliance <lb/>
of pure affection, and the high moral elements in the <lb/>
betrothed pair could not possibly result in anything else <lb/>
than peace and happiness. And as far as time has made <lb/>
her revelations, nothing could be less regretted than this <lb/>
illustrious union.</p>
<p>We have already seen how well affected the Marquis <lb/>
<pb n="7" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0024"/>
of Lorne was towards the Canadian people and the <lb/>
Dominion they called their home, and therefore it was <lb/>
a wise action on the part of the Legislature to appoint <lb/>
him Governor-General of Canada, on the resignation of <lb/>
Lord Dufferin.</p>
<p>But however much the appointment was for the <lb/>
general good, the departure of the distinguished pair was <lb/>
a great regret to the mother country.</p>
<p>The Marquis of Lorne and the Princess Louise bade <lb/>
farewell to England. Their parting was cheered by the <lb/>
cordial good wishes of the people of England, and by <lb/>
a confident hope that in their new sphere of action they <lb/>
would be able to do valuable service to the cause of <lb/>
imperial unity and strength.</p>
<p>The Governor-General of Canada, in his replies to the <lb/>
addresses of the Municipality and Chamber of <reg orig="Com-|merce">Commerce</reg> <lb/>
of Liverpool, touched with simplicity and delicacy <lb/>
upon the high responsibilities of the career on which he <lb/>
was entering. The Canadian people, when they read <lb/>
his words, which the Atlantic cable carried to them, <lb/>
were quick to perceive that the representative of the <lb/>
Queen among them, connected as he is by the closest <lb/>
relationship with the royal family, had a just <reg orig="appreci-|ation">appreciation</reg> <lb/>
of their worth and a thorough knowledge of their <lb/>
national development. His concluding words were <lb/>
worthy in every sense of the occasion:&mdash;</p>
<p>"In conclusion, I will only say that nothing has <lb/>
struck me more than the enthusiastic feeling manifested <lb/>
towards Canada among all classes of the community in <lb/>
<pb n="8" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0025"/>
England and Scotland. Wherever I have of late had an <lb/>
opportunity of hearing any expression of the public <lb/>
mind, crowds at any public gathering have always given <lb/>
cheers for Canada. This great gathering of to-day is a <lb/>
renewed symptom of the same favourable augury, for a <lb/>
good augury I hold it to be, that whenever there is an <lb/>
opportunity men in the old country are ready to call <lb/>
'Hurrah for Canada!' On the other side of the ocean <lb/>
they are as ready to call 'Hurrah for the Old Country!' <lb/>
And these cries are no mere words of the lips, but come <lb/>
from the heart of great peoples. So long as the feelings <lb/>
which prompt these sayings endure, and endure I believe <lb/>
they will, we may look forward with confidence to the <lb/>
future, and know that those bonds of affection which <lb/>
have been knit by God through the means of kinship <lb/>
and justice will not be sundered by disaster or weakened <lb/>
by time."</p>
<p>Only a dozen years have passed since the Marquis of <lb/>
Lorne visited Canada, as a young man travelling to <reg orig="com-|plete">complete</reg> <lb/>
his education, and without a thought, we may be <lb/>
sure, of the lot which was reserved for him in the <reg orig="com-|munities">communities</reg> <lb/>
he studied, yet the change to which he can <lb/>
personally testify is very remarkable. What was then <lb/>
"a mere collection of isolated colonies," as he says, is <lb/>
now "a great federal people," inspired at once by a <lb/>
confident faith in their own future and by a deep <lb/>
affection for the mother country and the institutions <lb/>
that symbolize and strengthen the connection with her.</p>
<p>It is to this sentiment that the presence of the <lb/>
<pb n="9" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0026"/>
Princess Louise in Canada, as the direct representative <lb/>
of the "fountain of honour in England's queen," will <lb/>
appeal. Loyalty will no doubt be quickened; and, as <lb/>
men are the creatures of habit, the colonists will value <lb/>
the imperial connection more highly when the idea of it <lb/>
is presented distinctly and constantly to their minds.</p>
<p>There can no longer be any possible pretext for the <lb/>
injurious suspicion that the mother country dispenses <lb/>
not of her best, but selects those who are found least <lb/>
serviceable at home for the conduct of colonial affairs, <lb/>
seeing that the daughter of Queen Victoria takes her <lb/>
place as the centre and ornament of the highest phases <lb/>
of social life in one of our colonies and will grace the <lb/>
brilliant hospitalities that will reflect the splendour of the <lb/>
Court itself.</p>
<div3 type="section" id="d15">
<head>THE DEPARTURE.</head>
<p>After receiving the addresses of welcome at the <reg orig="Liver-|pool">Liverpool</reg> <lb/>
Town Hall, the Marquis and the Princess Louise <lb/>
made their way down to the landing stage amid the <lb/>
cheers of the people. Punctually to their time, the <lb/>
royal party arrived at the pier-head, and alighted amid <lb/>
the cheers of the assembled multitudes and the strains of <lb/>
the National Anthem, played by the band of the 11th <lb/>
Regiment, the bells of St. Nicholas's Church ringing a <lb/>
joyous peal. Flags and streamers were abundant, and <lb/>
about half-way down Water Street was a large banner <lb/>
spanning the street and bearing the words, "Long life <lb/>
and happiness!" Her Royal Highness, the Marquis, <lb/>
<pb n="10" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0027"/>
and the two Princes, Connaught and Leopold, <reg orig="acknow-|ledged">acknowledged</reg> <lb/>
the loyal demonstrations repeatedly, and in the <lb/>
most cordial manner.</p>
<p>The Mayor having said adieu, the travellers went on <lb/>
board the tender, where their appearance again drew <lb/>
forth continuous rounds of cheering. The signal for the <lb/>
safe arrival on the <hi rend="italic">Sarmatian</hi> was the unfurling of the <lb/>
royal standard from the mainmast, and the moment <lb/>
this was done the salute was answered by cheers given <lb/>
by the multitude. Just as the tender had got alongside <lb/>
the <hi rend="italic">Sarmatian</hi> a postal messenger reached the stage with <lb/>
a letter for the Princess from the Prince of Wales, which <lb/>
had come down by special despatch. One of the Dock <lb/>
Board steamers was at once requisitioned, and the letter <lb/>
taken to the vessel by the messenger, accompanied by <lb/>
Mr. Rich, the Postmaster, and delivered to her Royal <lb/>
Highness. At twenty minutes past eleven the <hi rend="italic">Sarmatian</hi> <lb/>
had lifted her anchor, and was moving slowly down the <lb/>
river amid the renewed cheers of the people. As the <lb/>
royal steamer sailed away the band of the military came <lb/>
down to the stage and played a selection of airs, among <lb/>
which were "Friends far from Home," "Scots wha hae," <lb/>
"Highland Laddie," "John Anderson my Jo," and <lb/>
"Will ye no come back again."</p>
<p>There was an affecting leave-taking between the <lb/>
Princess and her brothers, before the latter left the <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Sarmatian</hi> in the tender <hi rend="italic">Stormcock.</hi> Her Royal <reg orig="High-|ness">Highness</reg> <lb/>
kissed both of them in the most affectionate manner, <lb/>
and then broke into tears. As the <hi rend="italic">Sarmatian</hi> passed the <lb/>
<pb n="11" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0028"/>
Rock, the battery fired a royal salute. The Princes <lb/>
left town soon after coming ashore.</p>
<p>The Princess Louise is the fourth daughter of her <lb/>
Majesty the Queen. Her Royal Highness is possessed <lb/>
of some considerable artistic characteristics which will <lb/>
be more closely scanned by the Canadians, and of these <lb/>
we have had sufficient knowledge to be able to predict <lb/>
that if a graceful condescension and a readiness to help <lb/>

her Royal Highness will speedily find her <lb/>

following so popular a Governor-General's wife as Lady <lb/>

will not suffer by the contrast.</p>
<p>Her marriage with the Marquis of Lorne was an <lb/>
occasion of national rejoicing and congratulation rarely <lb/>
equalled. As in some measure reflecting the loyal <lb/>
interest still so deeply felt in her welfare, the following <lb/>
lines written on her marriage will not be altogether out <lb/>
of season. They expressed Scotland's welcome to the <lb/>
Princess Louise:&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="stanza">
<l>"Sweet Rose of the South! contented to rest</l>

</lg>

<l>"Merry England has loved thee and cherished thee long,</l>

<l>"Though the voice that should bless, and the hand that should seal,</l>

<p>But why she is so pre-eminently fitted to adorn a <lb/>
volume having for its title "Christian Women" is that <lb/>
she has endeared herself by the founding of a Home for <lb/>
poor Girls, who would otherwise have been left to grow <lb/>
up as waifs and strays in the purlieus of our overcrowded <lb/>
metropolis.</p>
<p>Her illustrious brother the Prince of Wales, who <reg orig="fol-|lows">follows</reg> <lb/>
in his good father's footsteps, and is ever at hand <lb/>
with his purse and great influence to do all the good he <lb/>
possibly can amongst the people that he is destined to <lb/>
reign over, set his royal brothers and sisters an example <lb/>
of charity that the Princess Louise carried out in its <reg orig="ful-|ness">fulness</reg>. <lb/>
His Royal Highness and his amiable Princess of <lb/>
Wales founded a Home for Little Boys, which may be <lb/>
thus described, and to some extent the Princess Louise's <lb/>
Home is a reflex of the same.</p>
<pb n="13" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0030"/>
<p>The Home is intended for Little Boys who are either <lb/>
Homeless, or in danger of falling into crime. They must <lb/>
be under ten years of age at the time of their <hi rend="italic">actual <lb/>
admission.</hi> There is no other limit as to age, provided <lb/>
they can run alone. Boys whose parents are in prison, <lb/>
those who have been deserted by their parents, and <lb/>
those whose parents have received parish relief, are <lb/>
admitted if otherwise suitable. <hi rend="italic">But no boy is admitted <lb/>
who is eligible, according to the rules, for any of the Orphan <lb/>
Asylums.</hi></p>
<p>Admission is either by <hi rend="italic">Election of the Subscribers</hi>, or <lb/>
by <hi rend="italic">Payment.</hi> Elections are held half-yearly in June and <lb/>
December; and the successful Candidates are received <lb/>
entirely free as soon as there are vacancies. For those <lb/>
admitted on payment the charge is 6<hi rend="italic">s.</hi> a week, paid <lb/>
quarterly in advance, or &pound;15 a year if prepaid in one <lb/>
sum. This payment must be guaranteed for at least one <lb/>
year.</p>
<p>When a boy has been approved for election, he may <lb/>
be admitted on payment of 6<hi rend="italic">s.</hi> a week, if there be a <lb/>
vacancy, pending his election. By this means the <reg orig="ad-|mission">admission</reg> <lb/>
is not deferred, and as soon as he is elected he <lb/>
is retained free.</p>
<p>All Candidates for admission, whether on election or <lb/>
by payment, must be first approved by the Committee <lb/>
as eligible; and no canvassing of the Subscribers must <lb/>
take place on behalf of a boy sought to be elected until <lb/>
the case is thus approved.</p>
<p>All boys admitted, whether by election or on payment, <lb/>
<pb n="14" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0031"/>
are lodged, clothed, fed, educated, and trained to <reg orig="in-|dustrial">industrial</reg> <lb/>
work. They are retained till fourteen years of <lb/>
age, unless special circumstances render their removal <lb/>
at an earlier period necessary. At fourteen they are <lb/>
placed out in situations whenever practicable. The <lb/>
Committee do not guarantee to find situations; but <lb/>
where they are able and willing to do so, the disposal <lb/>
of the boy is left entirely and unreservedly in their <lb/>
hands.</p>
<p>The Home is open to Visitors &lpar;other than the relatives <lb/>
and personal friends of the boys&rpar; at all times, without any <lb/>
order of admission being required.</p>
<p>No boy is allowed to leave the Institution on a visit, <lb/>
except in the case of dangerous illness of a relative, when <lb/>
application for such permission, accompanied by a <reg orig="medi-|cal">medical</reg> <lb/>
certificate, should be made to the Secretary.</p>
<p>All communications respecting the <hi rend="italic">admission</hi> of boys, <lb/>
for the necessary forms of application, and as to <reg orig="pay-|ments">payments</reg>, <lb/>
should be addressed to the Secretary, at the <lb/>
<hi rend="small-caps">London Office.</hi></p>
<p>An Annual Subscriber has two votes at each Election <lb/>
for every Half Guinea Subscription.</p>
<p>A Life Subscriber has two votes for every Five <lb/>
Guineas Donation.</p>
<p>In this "Home" it appears from the Secretary's <reg orig="pro-|gramme">programme</reg>, <lb/>
300 little boys are now being sheltered and <lb/>
cared for in the Ten Family Homes at Farningham.</p>
<p>They have been taken from their very earliest age, <lb/>
some as young as twenty-two months old.</p>
<pb n="15" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0032"/>
<p>They have been provided with a Home because they <lb/>
were either Homeless, or in danger of falling into <lb/>
crime.</p>
<p>Many of these little ones were in this state through <lb/>
the death of their parents; others from wilful neglect; <lb/>
and others owing to the sinful life of those who ought <lb/>
to have cared for them: while some have so early <lb/>
manifested a disposition to crime that they must needs <lb/>
be rescued from evil when still little boys not ten years <lb/>
of age.</p>
<p>TO-DAY these 300 boys are being trained to become <lb/>
honest, useful men.</p>
<p>They are lodged in happy homes.</p>
<p>They are well clothed, and fed on homely fare.</p>
<p>They are educated in the School of the <reg orig="Institu-|tion">Institution</reg> <lb/>
by efficient Teachers, under Government <reg orig="Inspec-|tion">Inspection</reg>.</p>
<p>They are taught habits of industry, by being employed <lb/>
in making and mending their own clothes and boots; <lb/>
mending their shirts and socks; making all the bread <lb/>
for the Institution; cultivating the land for garden and <lb/>
farm purposes; tending the pigs, horses, and poultry; <lb/>
painting, glazing, carpentering, mat-making, upholstering, <lb/>
and printing.</p>
<p>They are, above all, trained in the fear of God, and <lb/>
taught His Holy Word. They daily have their family <lb/>
prayers and their Bible reading, and they meet <reg orig="to-|gether">together</reg> <lb/>
every Sunday for the public worship of God.</p>
<p>Most heartily do the Committee thank God for the <lb/>
<pb n="16" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0033"/>
work He has permitted them to do on behalf of these <lb/>
little ones.</p>
<p>The Princess Louise is the Patroness of the Victoria <lb/>
Hospital for sick children at Chelsea. In this asylum, <lb/>
before she left for Canada, the Princess took a great <reg orig="in-|terest">interest</reg>. <lb/>
The hospital is national in its character, patients <lb/>
from all parts and of every religious denomination being <lb/>
admitted. Since it was established in 1866 it has <reg orig="re-|lieved">relieved</reg> <lb/>
3,000 in-patients and 132,000 out-patients. She <lb/>
is also patroness of the Asylum for the support and <reg orig="edu-|cation">education</reg> <lb/>
of Deaf and Dumb children.</p>
<p>The only rivalry amongst the members of our royal <lb/>
family is which shall do the most good in the offices of <lb/>
charity, not only in almsgiving, but earnest working in <lb/>
the cause of institutions established for the benefit of <lb/>
the homeless, sick and suffering.</p>

&lsqb;<hi rend="small-caps">originator of trained nurses for hospitals and <lb/>
infirmaries.</hi>&rsqb;</head>
<figure id="f5" rend="block" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0034"/>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">In</hi> an introduction to the life of this energetic <reg orig="Chris-|tian">Christian</reg> <lb/>
woman, who humbly dedicated herself to God <lb/>
and the welfare of mankind, Florence Nightingale wrote <lb/>
&lpar;1868&rpar;: "One woman has died&mdash;a woman attractive, <lb/>
and rich, and young, and witty; yet a veiled and silent <lb/>
woman, distinguished by no other genius but the Divine <lb/>
genius&mdash;working hard to train herself in order to train <lb/>
others to walk in the footsteps of Him who went about <lb/>
doing good. To follow Him, she spent herself in <reg orig="ac-|tivity">activity</reg>. <lb/>
She overworked because others underwork. Shall <lb/>
we let her have died in vain? She died, as she had <lb/>
lived, at her post, in one of the largest workhouse <reg orig="infir-|maries">infirmaries</reg> <lb/>
in the kingdom, the first in which trained nursing <lb/>
has been introduced. She is the pioneer of workhouse <lb/>
nursing. I do not give her name! Were she alive, she <lb/>
would beg me not. Of all human beings I have ever <lb/>
known, she was &lpar;I was about to say&rpar; the most free from <lb/>
desire of the praise of men. But I cannot say most free, <lb/>
for she was perfectly free. She was absolutely without <lb/>
human vanity; she preferred being unknown to all but <lb/>
<pb n="18" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0035"/>
God; she did not let her right hand know what her left <lb/>
hand did. I will therefore call her Una, if you please; <lb/>
for when her whole life and image rise before me, so far <lb/>
from thinking the story of Una and her lion a myth, I <lb/>
say here is Una in real flesh and blood&mdash;Una and her <lb/>
paupers, far more untameable than lions.</p>
<p>"The graceful, tender legends of Catholic saints and <lb/>
martyrs have not a greater miracle than we have here in <lb/>
the flesh. She lived the life, and died the death, of the <lb/>
saints and martyrs; though the greatest sinner would not <lb/>
have been more surprised than she to have heard this <lb/>
said of herself. In less than three years she had <reg orig="re-|duced">reduced</reg> <lb/>
one of the most disorderly hospital populations in <lb/>
the world to something like Christian discipline such as <lb/>
the police themselves wondered at. She had led, so as <lb/>
to be of one mind and heart with her, upwards of fifty <lb/>
nurses and probationers; of whom the faithful few whom <lb/>
she took with her of our trained nurses were but a <lb/>
seed. She had converted a vestry to the conviction <lb/>
of the economy as well as humanity of nursing pauper <lb/>
sick by trained nurses,&mdash;the first instance of the kind <lb/>
in England; for vestries, of whom she had almost the <lb/>
most enlightened, the most liberal body of men in <lb/>
England to support her, <hi rend="italic">must</hi> look after the pockets of <lb/>
their ratepayers as well as the benefit of their sick.</p>
<p>"She had disarmed all opposition, all sectarian <reg orig="zealot-|ism">zealotism</reg>; <lb/>
so that Roman Catholic and Unitarian, High <lb/>
Church and Low Church, all literally rose up and called <lb/>
her blessed. In less than three years&mdash;the time generally <lb/>
<pb n="19" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0036"/>
given to the ministry on earth of that Saviour whom she <lb/>
so earnestly strove closely to follow&mdash;she did all this. <lb/>
She had the gracefulness, the wit, the unfailing <reg orig="cheerful-|ness&mdash;qualities">cheerfulness&mdash;qualities</reg> <lb/>
so remarkable but so much overlooked <lb/>
in our Saviour's life. She had the absence of all <reg orig="asceti-|cism">asceticism</reg> <lb/>
or 'mortification' for mortification's sake, which <lb/>
characterized His work, and any real work in the present <lb/>
day as in His day.</p>
<p>"And how did she do all this? She was not, when <lb/>
a girl, of any conspicuous ability, except that she <reg orig="culti-|vated">cultivated</reg> <lb/>
in herself to the utmost a power of getting through <lb/>
business in a short time, without slurring it over and <lb/>
without fid-fadding at it&mdash;real business, her Father's <reg orig="busi-|ness">business</reg>. <lb/>
She was always filled with the thought that she <lb/>
must be about her 'Father's business.'</p>
<p>"She could do, and she did do, more of her Father's <lb/>
business in six hours than ordinary women do in six <lb/>
months, or than most of even the best women do in six <lb/>
days. But besides this and including this, she had <lb/>
trained herself to the utmost&mdash;she was always training <lb/>
herself; for this is no holiday work. Nursing is an art; <lb/>
and, if it is to be made an art, requires as exclusive a <lb/>
devotion, as hard a preparation, as any painter's or <lb/>
sculptor's work; for what is the having to do with dead <lb/>
canvas or cold marble compared with having to do with <lb/>
the living body&mdash;the temple of God's Spirit?"</p>
<p>The well-spent life of Agnes Elizabeth Jones was <reg orig="writ-|ten">written</reg> <lb/>
by her sister, and from this we gather that the <reg orig="sub-|ject">subject</reg> <lb/>
of our sketch was born in 1832, at Cambridge. Her <lb/>
<pb n="20" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0037"/>
father was Lieutenant-Colonel of the 12th regiment, and <lb/>
had been ordered to Cambridge a few days previous <lb/>
to her birth. She had many infantine illnesses, and <lb/>
continued very delicate until she was nearly two years <lb/>
old, when she was taken on a visit to Ireland, the native <lb/>
country of both her parents, and there she grew healthy <lb/>
and strong in the pure country air. She was now a very <lb/>
pretty child, with the brightness of eye which was ever <lb/>
one of her most striking features, sunny curling hair, and <lb/>
a light dancing step, full of joyous life.</p>
<p>In 1837 she sailed with her father and family from <lb/>
Cork for Mauritius. The six years spent there appear to <lb/>
have been very happy ones to the bright little child, <lb/>
and vivid memories would often arise in after years of <lb/>
the birthday excursions to the Pampelmousse Gardens, <lb/>
where many beautiful palm-trees and rare tropical plants <lb/>
grew in native luxuriance, and of pleasant months spent <lb/>
by the seaside at Mah&eacute;bourg, where wonderful shells <lb/>
with rosy tints and pearly linings were now and then <lb/>
the prize of the eager searcher. "Even at this time," <lb/>
says her biographer, "her love of nature was one of her <lb/>
characteristics."</p>
<p>But besides her love of nature, it was during her stay <lb/>
here that her love of God first developed itself. She <lb/>
had great pleasure in accompanying her parents to the <lb/>
Bible readings held at the house of the French pastor, <lb/>
Monsieur le Brun. Some years afterwards she wrote: <lb/>
"I think my first real concern for my soul was awakened <lb/>
by the closing sentences of young M. le Brun's sermon <lb/>
<pb n="21" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0038"/>
one week-day evening. 'And now, brethren, if you <lb/>
cannot answer me, how will you at the last day answer <lb/>
the great Searcher of hearts?' This sentence haunted <lb/>
me night and day for some time."</p>
<p>Here, too, she became interested in the Madagascar <lb/>
Christians, then suffering cruel persecutions for <reg orig="con-|science">conscience</reg> <lb/>
sake. Some of them took refuge in Mauritius, <lb/>
and her delight at being taken to visit them was very <lb/>
great. From this time a desire for missionary work took <lb/>
possession of her mind. The extreme reserve of her <lb/>
disposition prevented this being generally known; but <lb/>
from the time she was seven years old the dream of her <lb/>
life was to be one day a missionary. The wish, as she <lb/>
then formed it, for work among the heathen, was never <lb/>
granted, but truly her whole life was a missionary work. <lb/>
In a paper of recollections of her early childhood, she <lb/>
writes: "I remember always having great love for any <lb/>
one I thought one of God's children, I loved going to <lb/>
church, and listening to serious conversation."</p>
<p>"During her stay at Mauritius," says her sister <reg orig="bio-|grapher">biographer</reg>, <lb/>
"two examples of her resolve and <reg orig="determina-|tion">determination</reg> <lb/>
in carrying out a purpose once formed, may be <lb/>
given. When she was about eight years old a friend <lb/>
sent her a present of a young kangaroo from Australia. <lb/>
An enclosure was made for it in the garden, and Agnes <lb/>
delighted to feed and visit it daily. One day, as she <lb/>
opened the gate, it escaped and bounded off into our <lb/>
neighbour's plantation. Agnes followed, fearing it might <lb/>
do mischief, climbed over the low wall which separated <lb/>
<pb n="22" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0039"/>
the two gardens, and, after a long chase, succeeded in <lb/>
capturing the fugitive. Some minutes afterwards my <lb/>
mother came into the garden, and was horror-struck to <lb/>
see her returning from the pursuit, the kangaroo, which <lb/>
she held bravely by its ears, struggling wildly for <reg orig="free-|dom">freedom</reg>, <lb/>
and tearing at her with its hind feet, while her <lb/>
dress was streaming with blood from the wounds inflicted <lb/>
by its nails. Mamma called to her to let go, but she <lb/>
would not do so until she got it safely into its house, <lb/>
although it was many a long day before she lost the <lb/>
marks of her battle and victory. Another instance of <lb/>
the same fixed resolve, whatever she might have to <reg orig="suf-|fer">suffer</reg> <lb/>
in carrying it out, occurred some years later, when <lb/>
she was about fourteen. My father was extremely fond <lb/>
of music, and very anxious that we should play well. <lb/>
Agnes had no taste for it, and it cost her much trouble <lb/>
to learn the simplest air. Knowing how much my father <lb/>
wished her to improve, she gave it her undivided <reg orig="atten-|tion">attention</reg>, <lb/>
and laboured painfully to conquer the difficulty. <lb/>
At last she had mastered a piece sufficiently to play it <lb/>
before company, and one evening when a few friends <lb/>
were with us, she was told to get her music. She did <lb/>
so, and by a strong effort of will, overcame her <reg orig="nervous-|ness">nervousness</reg>, <lb/>
and played the piece through without a mistake. <lb/>
She then left the room without saying anything, and <lb/>
soon afterwards was found upstairs by one of the <reg orig="ser-|vants">servants</reg> <lb/>
in violent hysterics."</p>
<p>At the age of fourteen she wrote the following <reg orig="frag-|ment">fragment</reg> <lb/>
in her journal: "November 10th, 1846. To-day <lb/>
<pb n="23" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0040"/>
I am fourteen. When I look back at the past year I <lb/>
see nothing but sin, deformity, and unhappiness. I only <lb/>
feel that I have improved in music. This morning I <lb/>
made many good resolutions, I fear too much in my own <lb/>
strength, for in the course of the day I broke them all."</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">November</hi> 11.&mdash;Awoke and wept at having broken <lb/>
my resolutions."</p>
<p>"Agnes," writes her sister, "had a peculiarly <reg orig="sensi-|tive">sensitive</reg> <lb/>
conscience; the smallest fault she magnified into <lb/>
a sin, and grieved for it accordingly. Then from her <lb/>
reserve and the power she had of concealing her <reg orig="emo-|tion">emotion</reg>, <lb/>
no one knew of this hidden life, so that she had not <lb/>
the help she might have had."</p>
<p>In 1850 she lost her dear father, and Agnes and her <lb/>
sister were summoned home from Stratford-on-Avon, <lb/>
where they had been at school for two years, but they <lb/>
arrived too late to see him. She writes in 1856: "<reg orig="Sun-|day">Sunday</reg> <lb/>
is a day of many memories of my dear father; it <lb/>
seems to me especially his. Perhaps the seeing most of <lb/>
him on that day made me first love Sunday; but I <reg orig="al-|ways">always</reg> <lb/>
much enjoyed going to church. At Mah&eacute;bourg his <lb/>
service for the soldiers, then our crossing the river, and <lb/>
evening worship in a solitary place. I could find these <lb/>
spots now, after all these years; then standing by his <lb/>
side in the corner of the verandah, the moonlight <reg orig="stream-|ing">streaming</reg> <lb/>
down upon us, learning, and repeating or hearing <lb/>
his hymns, and looking up to that dear face where was <lb/>
such holy love, joy, and peace, and the tears often as he <lb/>
repeated, 'See from His head, His hands, His feet,' or <lb/>
<pb n="24" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0041"/>
joined in the responses and singing in church. Oh, how <lb/>
I worshipped him! Then the frequent hearing of his <lb/>
earnest prayers through the closed door of his <reg orig="dressing-|room">dressing-room</reg>, <lb/>
impressed me deeply. His last words, as he <lb/>
parted with us at Leamington some months before his <lb/>
death, were such a heartfelt 'God bless you!' I <reg orig="re-|member">remember</reg> <lb/>
how their solemnity thrilled me. He felt, what <lb/>
we little guessed, that our next look on that dear <reg orig="coun-|tenance">countenance</reg> <lb/>
would be when it was stiffened in death. I did <lb/>
not then gaze on it as I would now, for the shock of my <lb/>
first view of death as the follower of a long illness made <lb/>
me less mindful at the time of the sweet, peaceful, happy, <lb/>
loving look, which showed how death was to him robbed <lb/>
of its sting. But it was the first realization of <reg orig="orphan-|hood">orphanhood</reg>, <lb/>
and I feared to ask permission to return, dreading <lb/>
to hear it was too late."</p>
<p>From this time the character of the little Agnes <lb/>
developed more rapidly, especially in its simple, unselfish <lb/>
devotion to others. She seemed to feel herself <reg orig="respon-|sible">responsible</reg> <lb/>
for their comfort and happiness, and her mother, <lb/>
sister, and brother were the objects of a watchful care, <lb/>
which was ever ready to minister to them, at any <reg orig="sacri-|fice">sacrifice</reg> <lb/>
of her own ease and pleasure. Childish things were <lb/>
laid aside, and a certain thought and feeling was <reg orig="per-|ceptible">perceptible</reg>.</p>
<p>The summer of 1850, Mrs. Jones and her family <reg orig="re-|moved">removed</reg> <lb/>
from Fahan to Dublin for their permanent <reg orig="resid-|ence">residence</reg>, <lb/>
that her children might have the benefit of masters, <lb/>
and the girls at once joined the Rev. John Gregg's <lb/>
<pb n="25" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0042"/>
church and congregation. His clear gospel teaching and <lb/>
earnest personal appeal to the hearts of the young, awoke <lb/>
new desires after God. Her aunt and godmother, who <lb/>
ever watched over her spiritual life with the deepest <lb/>
interest, said, "Her confirmation seemed to me the time <lb/>
of Agnes's real conversion; she wrote me such a letter, <lb/>
and told me that, on returning to her pew, her sins had <lb/>
all seemed to rise up before her. From that time I truly <lb/>
believe the earnest desire of her heart was to live to <lb/>
God."</p>
<p>One of her earliest labours of love, which was scarcely <lb/>
noticed by the family at the time, was recalled to their <lb/>
memory fifteen years after when her aunt met the lady, <lb/>
in a house they lodged at while in Dublin. She asked <lb/>
especially for Agnes, and added, "I shall never forget <lb/>
how that young creature, all through the winter they <lb/>
spent in my house, used to come down to the kitchen <lb/>
every Sunday evening to read the Bible to Larry and <lb/>
Eliza" &lpar;servants in the house&rpar;.</p>
<p>From early childhood she was always busy about <lb/>
something; one never saw her with her hands <reg orig="unem-|ployed">unemployed</reg>, <lb/>
and the amount of work she accomplished in <lb/>
this way was wonderful. Lieutenant Jones had <reg orig="encour-|aged">encouraged</reg> <lb/>
his children to write out during the week their <lb/>
recollection of the Sunday sermons, and this practice <lb/>
Agnes never gave up until time failed her for it in the <lb/>
last few years of overwhelming work, yet to the last she <lb/>
wrote recollections of any peculiarly striking or <reg orig="profit-|able">profitable</reg> <lb/>
sermons.</p>
<pb n="26" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0043"/>
<p>In 1853 the widow of Lieutenant Jones and her <lb/>
family started for the Continent, and early in June <lb/>
reached Bonn, on the Rhine, where some weeks were <lb/>
happily spent.</p>
<p>"Much of our time was taken up," says the sister <reg orig="bio-|grapher">biographer</reg>, <lb/>
"preparing for masters, but the afternoons were <lb/>
generally devoted to long country walks and drives, <lb/>
which were often enlivened by the pleasure and <reg orig="profit-|able">profitable</reg> <lb/>
conversation of the Rev. W. Graham, a missionary <lb/>
to the Jews, who had been for some years settled at <lb/>
Bonn. On June 21st we all went over to Kaiserswerth, <lb/>
accompanied by Mr. Graham, and spent a long <reg orig="sum-|mer's">summer's</reg> <lb/>
day in visiting the various schools, hospitals, and <lb/>
other departments of that most valuable institution. <lb/>
Little did we think of the deep effect that day's visit was <lb/>
to produce."</p>
<p>The visit is referred to in Agnes' journal, and she thus <lb/>
concludes with the following words, which seem almost <lb/>
prophetic:&mdash;</p>
<p>"As we drove away, my great wish was that this might <lb/>
not be my last visit to Kaiserswerth. Surely such visits <lb/>
should not be unprofitable; if the thoughts of that day <lb/>
be blessed, and its impressions deepened, it will not, I <lb/>
trust, be so. That visit was, I believe, a talent <reg orig="com-|mitted">committed</reg> <lb/>
to our care; may it not be buried."</p>
<p>And a few days later she writes again:&mdash;</p>
<p>"At breakfast it was proposed, and mamma consented <lb/>
to the plan, that Aunt E. and I should spend a week <lb/>
at Kaiserswerth in order the better to understand the <lb/>
<pb n="27" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0044"/>
whole working of the institution. This is more than I <lb/>
ever dared to hope. How thankful I should be! May <lb/>
a blessing attend that visit; may my feeble desires to do <lb/>
good to others be deepened and purified. The Lord <lb/>
has heard my prayers and answered them in an <reg orig="unex-|pected">unexpected</reg> <lb/>
manner; surely this visit should be an <reg orig="encourage-|ment">encouragement</reg> <lb/>
to prayer, and a seal that God will answer it. Lord <lb/>
Thou hast in this answered my prayer; add yet other <lb/>
blessings; oh, give me a large measure of Thy Spirit. <lb/>
Go with us, Lord, to Kaiserswerth; be with us and bless <lb/>
us. Make all things now and then to work for Thy <lb/>
glory and our good. Sanctify us wholly; sanctify our <lb/>
desires and thoughts."</p>
<p>A few days later she writes thus from Kaiserswerth, <lb/>
which gives us a good insight into that institution:&mdash;</p>
<p>"My darling J. Though none of the dreadful things <lb/>
you imagined have happened to me, I was very glad <lb/>
to receive your letter, and to hear that you are all <lb/>
so well. We breakfast at 6, dine at 12, have tea at <lb/>
four, and supper at 7, bed at 10. This is a very busy <lb/>
day, and we have seen neither Louisa Fliedner nor my <lb/>
dear friend Hedwig, who are generally much with us. <lb/>
<foreign lang="ger"><hi rend="italic">Wir leben zusammen</hi></foreign>, as they say. They both speak <lb/>
very well, especially the latter. Yesterday I had such a <lb/>
pleasant talk with her; she believes that I shall come <lb/>
back here; I am sure I shall if it be for my good. Dear <lb/>
Hedwig! she was telling me I must not expect to find all <lb/>
<foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italic">couleur de rose</hi></foreign> in the service of the Lord here; in so many <lb/>
things we feel the same. She belongs to one of the very <lb/>
<pb n="28" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0045"/>
highest families in Germany; now she is principally <lb/>
engaged in teaching in the seminarist's house, but even <lb/>
the pastor himself was astonished at the cheerfulness with <lb/>
which, as 'probe Schwester,' she did any menial work. <lb/>
Each person here is, as far as possible, assigned to the <lb/>
work for which they are best fitted. There is much <lb/>
freedom every way. Each ward has its deaconess who <lb/>
has many 'probe Schwestern' under her; all <reg orig="respon-|sibility">responsibility</reg> <lb/>
devolves on her the sister, and one evening every <lb/>
week each sister comes to consult with the mother <lb/>
&lpar;Madame Fliedner&rpar; and tell her her difficulties and trials. <lb/>
The mother is indeed a mother, overseeing all, helping <lb/>
and advising all. Yesterday, being the first Sunday in <lb/>
the month, all went to the church at night, and there <lb/>
was a special prayer for all the sisters here and abroad. <lb/>
In the fifteen institutions in different parts of the world <lb/>
there is a prayer-meeting at the same hour; this meeting <lb/>
in spirit is much prized. There is such love between all, <lb/>
and every one is so free, no one would think it a convent. <lb/>
Love seems indeed, as far as human nature permits, to <lb/>
pervade every action. I am so happy here; it is so <reg orig="de-|lightful">delightful</reg> <lb/>
to see every one so busy, and in the Lord's work; <lb/>
all are so loving and excellent, their whole hearts are in <lb/>
the work. It is a blessed thing to be among them. I <lb/>
wish you would all come here. Aunt and I went with <lb/>
Louisa Fliedner, seven of her insane patients, and five <lb/>
deaconesses to a farm near this, where we had some <lb/>
coffee. The patients enjoy this, and it is good for them; <lb/>
Louisa begged us to talk to them, as it pleased them so <lb/>
<pb n="29" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0046"/>
much. Fancy us for three hours walking and talking <lb/>
with these people in German. Not only the labour of <lb/>
talking German so long, but the anxiety lest I should <lb/>
touch a dangerous point, made it rather fatiguing. All <lb/>
went off well. We walked along the mill-stream, and <lb/>
they went in a boat on the mill-pond; they were so <lb/>
obedient, and the deaconesses seemed only amusing <lb/>
themselves, but never took their eyes off the patients. <lb/>
One old lady was very inquisitive, some would scarcely <lb/>
speak, but all were pleased with the foreigners. <reg orig="Yester-|day">Yesterday</reg>, <lb/>
I was in the hospital and infant school all day. If <lb/>
any one comes here to find quiet rest or solitude, they <lb/>
are very much mistaken, for all are busy, yet have their <lb/>
work so beautifully apportioned that there is never <reg orig="any-|thing">anything</reg> <lb/>
neglected or left undone, yet no bustle. Link <lb/>
within link binds all together, not only in the house here, <lb/>
but in the 102 deaconesses abroad."</p>
<p>On the return of the family to Ireland in 1853 Agnes <lb/>
resumed her former life in Dublin, only devoting more <lb/>
time to teaching in the ragged schools than she had done <lb/>
before; earnestly she desired more work for God, and <lb/>
she blamed herself for indolence and carelessness, <lb/>
because she did not do more, yet never did she neglect <lb/>
home duties or leave undone what was ready to her <lb/>
hands.</p>
<p>Now although she seldom spoke of Kaiserwerth, the <lb/>
following passage in her journal shows she had a strong <lb/>
wish to return there:&mdash;</p>
<p>"When this time two years ago I left Kaiserwerth, <lb/>
<pb n="30" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0047"/>
my wish and prayer were that I might some time return <lb/>
there to be fitted and trained for active work in my <lb/>
Father's service. How often since have that wish and <lb/>
prayer been breathed! I may almost say they have <lb/>
been ever with me; and though I acknowledge that <lb/>
they should not have had greater effect in making me <lb/>
use my small knowledge and stirred me up to greater <lb/>
exertions, still, with gratitude I write it, they have never <lb/>
had such an undue influence as to make me <reg orig="discon-|tented">discontented</reg> <lb/>
and impatient that my wish was ungratified&mdash; <lb/>
my prayer unanswered; and when a few short days ago, <lb/>
mamma proposed my going in August, with what <reg orig="trem-|bling">trembling</reg> <lb/>
joy did I find that accorded, unasked, which I <lb/>
should not have thought it right to ask. May I take <lb/>
this fact alone as the pillar of fire to lead me on? It <lb/>
is the way that inclination points, therefore an <reg orig="inves-|tigation">investigation</reg> <lb/>
as to the direction of duty will be only fair. <lb/>
Inclination may lead to self-deception. O God, for <lb/>
Jesus' sake, direct me! The duty on the side of <reg orig="Kaisers-|werth">Kaiserswerth</reg> <lb/>
is clear, and may be summed up in a few words. <lb/>
As we use means to fit us for any earthly profession, <lb/>
so are we bound to use every means which will enable <lb/>
us to adorn our Christian profession.</p>
<p>"This is a means; it is now offered to me. If God <lb/>
sends me and blesses me, it may be a means for His <lb/>
glory and the good of my fellow-creatures. If I go, <lb/>
Lord sanctify my motives. An application of 'Lord, let <lb/>
me first go and bury my father,' struck me to-day, <lb/>
There is, even when I leave my mother, even for a <lb/>
<pb n="31" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0048"/>
short day, a half-unacknowledged, undefined fear that <lb/>
I may not see her again, and this comes over me when <lb/>
I think of leaving her to go to Kaiserswerth. 'Lord, <lb/>
let me wait till death removes my father, then I will <lb/>
follow thee,' said a man to Jesus. The answer bade <lb/>
him come at once. J. is now with mamma; this may <lb/>
be the most convenient time for leaving her. Life is <lb/>
short, the work to be done, great. The preparation <lb/>
should be made at once."</p>
<p>But her ardent wishes were not at present to be <lb/>
realized. J.'s approaching marriage put an obstacle in <lb/>
the way, and in the spring of 1856 Agnes and her <lb/>
mamma returned to the old home at Fahan. Here for <lb/>
a while she was intensely happy, every spot of the place <lb/>
being invested with hallowed memories. Here in the <lb/>
little churchyard was her dear father's grave. Here, too, <lb/>
her long-cherished dream of a life devoted to the sick <lb/>
and sorrowful began to be realized. In the school; by <lb/>
the sick bed of the dying; in the lowly cottage where <lb/>
some sudden accident had brought sorrow and despair, <lb/>
and where her gentle self-possession and promptly wise <lb/>
action seemed often to bring healing and hope; <reg orig="every-|where">everywhere</reg> <lb/>
she was found about her Father's business. <lb/>
"None," says her biographer, "who saw can ever <lb/>
forget her as she would return from those distant lonely <lb/>
walks; her colour brightened by the keen mountain air, <lb/>
her curls blown about by the breeze, and her fair, happy <lb/>
face beaming with the consciousness of having brought <lb/>
comfort and blessing to some of God's poor. She had <lb/>
<pb n="32" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0049"/>
a very tender and loving sympathy for the poor, and <lb/>
often writes of the happiness it was to her to be among <lb/>
them. When on a visit at the house of one of my <lb/>
uncles, she writes:&mdash;</p>
<p>"'I have to this place a feeling that I have to no <lb/>
other, save Fahan, from the knowledge that here a few <lb/>
poor look on me as a friend. How my heart leaps with <lb/>
joy to see a look or smile of welcome from the poor, <lb/>
much more than at a warmer reception from the <lb/>
rich!'"</p>
<p>And again,&mdash;</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">March</hi>, 1857.&mdash;I thank God for the great blessing <lb/>
of health and strength to go amongst the poor. What <lb/>
a sore trial it would be to be forced to cease from <lb/>
visiting them! Their cordial welcome cheers me, and <lb/>
the hope of doing them good is such an incentive; <lb/>
when I come to one who is a Christian, and hear her <lb/>
prayers for me, then there rises within me a deep <reg orig="well-|spring">wellspring</reg> <lb/>
of joy."</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">October</hi>, 1857.&mdash;To-day, winter came in hail and <lb/>
snow and bitter cold. I put on winter array, but felt <lb/>
almost ashamed to go into the cottages so warmly <lb/>
clothed. What a contrast between visitor and visited! <lb/>
Who made me to differ? Health, strength, and this <lb/>
warm clothing, enabling me to go out in all weather, <lb/>
are talents; oh, may each and all be more and more <lb/>
used for His glory. A blessing to-day from old Mrs. <lb/>
W. warmed me so that I felt not the cold. She said, <lb/>
'The Lord love you, for I love you.'"</p>
<pb n="33" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0050"/>
<p>And yet, another testimony to her heartfelt love of <lb/>
the poor:&mdash;</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">December</hi> 20.&mdash;I do not like to give the poor their <lb/>
Christmas gifts so long before. I would like the joy <lb/>
to come to them on that day, to go myself with each <lb/>
little love-token. What joy is like that called forth by <lb/>
the gratitude of the poor, often too big for words! I <lb/>
never know whether to laugh or cry. Among the many <lb/>
thanks and blessings I have received to-day, none have <lb/>
been as hearty or overpowering as Widow D.'s, and her <lb/>
prayer for me was that God would never leave or <lb/>
forsake me, but bring me safe to heaven. The blessings <lb/>
of an aged saint come so home to one, while the words <lb/>
of others seem an empty form."</p>
<p>"Every morning," her sister biographer continues, <lb/>
"unless detained by home duties, she set off on her <lb/>
rounds after breakfast, returning to early dinner, only <lb/>
to start again immediately afterwards, and prolonging <lb/>
her absence often until darkness had closed in. No <lb/>
weather deterred her; no distance was too great; no <lb/>
road too lonely. Many times in winter she came back <lb/>
from her mountain walks with her cloak stiff with ice, <lb/>
and her hands benumbed with cold; but nothing could <lb/>
damp her brave spirit, and the joy of her work kept her <lb/>
up. Her skill in prescribing for the sick, and her gentle <lb/>
but firm touch in dressing wounds, and especially in <lb/>
cases of burns and scalds, soon became famous in the <lb/>
neighbourhood, and the poor people came many miles <lb/>
across the mountains to consult her, and to get <lb/>
<pb n="34" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0051"/>
medicines, salve, etc. The turf-fires on the cottage <lb/>
hearths, round which little children often gather <reg orig="with-|out">without</reg> <lb/>
much watching or care, are the fruitful source of <lb/>
many severe burns, and, on such occasions, Agnes was <lb/>
always sent for. Sometimes it was a very fearful sight <lb/>
that met her, but she never shrank from anything <reg orig="be-|cause">because</reg> <lb/>
it was painful, if she could but relieve suffering, <lb/>
and day after day she would go to dress the burns until <lb/>
her care was no longer needed. She was so considerate, <lb/>
too, so thoughtful, of their comfort; never forgetting to <lb/>
take cake or fruit for the poor little sufferer to beguile <lb/>
it during the painful dressing, as well as more <reg orig="sub-|stantial">substantial</reg> <lb/>
food, where that was needed. Roman Catholics <lb/>
as well as Protestants were visited and cared for; she <lb/>
made no distinction of creed or sect in ministering to <lb/>
the needy ones."</p>
<p>A few further extracts from her journal, taken from <lb/>
her sister's "Memorials of Agnes Elizabeth Jones," <lb/>
may, perhaps, help to bring her life still more vividly <lb/>
before the reader:&mdash;</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">November</hi> 15, 1856.&mdash;To-day I went to old Mrs. D.; <lb/>
she seemed very low, but I trust her hope is sure. My <lb/>
thoughts went back to former visits. Have I really set <lb/>
the whole gospel before her? How humbling to go <lb/>
time after time and feel such want of words and want <lb/>
of power in setting Jesus forth! As I went into a new <lb/>
cottage to-day many doubts arose. When I can do so <lb/>
little in speaking and awakening to those I visit, why <lb/>
go to more? but this was a temptation to yield to my <lb/>
<pb n="35" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0052"/>
foolish timidity. He who knows the thoughts answered <lb/>
mine, for when I left the cottage, a stranger came up, <reg orig="say-|ing">saying</reg>, <lb/>
'I hear you lend tracts, and should be glad of some. <lb/>
This is indeed encouragement, for which I thank God. <lb/>
The promise is beginning to be realized to me, 'He that <lb/>
watereth others shall be watered himself;' for when I <lb/>
read and try to explain a chapter, passages strike me with <lb/>
a force of which I knew nothing when reading alone.</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">November</hi> 30.&mdash;How often do Mr. A.'s words warn <lb/>
or comfort me! To-day those which came home to my <lb/>
heart were words of encouragement, truly God-sent, <lb/>
'The Lord hath need of thee.' How often, in my <lb/>
secret heart, do I long to avoid this or that visit and <lb/>
wish to postpone it! Even to-day I thought, 'The <lb/>
snow is heavy, the roads slippery; my headache severe; <lb/>
how gladly would I remain at home!' But how could <lb/>
I with those words in my ear? Each step was cheered <lb/>
by them; better than the cry 'Excelsior,' came those <lb/>
soft, gentle, loving words, 'The Lord hath need of <lb/>
thee.' He so high, the Lord of heaven and earth, with <lb/>
His myriad angels, can He use, much less need, the <lb/>
instrumentality of such as I? If it be so, and I read <lb/>
also, 'Thou knowest not whether shall prosper this or <lb/>
that,' shall I let a little thing stop me?"</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">February</hi> 25.&mdash;On my return from Ardmore last <lb/>
evening, I ran up to see poor little M. W. who I heard <lb/>
was dying. She took and held my hand, and, from its <lb/>
motion in answer to my question, signified her <unclear id="u1">sure</unclear> <lb/>
dependence on Christ alone. Dear little girl, I feel so <lb/>
<pb n="36" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0053"/>
sure of her safety; many things she has said to me prove <lb/>
her trust to be placed on the Rock of Ages."</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">March</hi> 14.&mdash;Mrs. L. died yesterday. The last <lb/>
words I heard her say as I supported her in my arms <lb/>
were, 'I will fear no evil for Thou art with me.' This <lb/>
was about twelve hours before she went to Jesus. Hers <lb/>
was no death-bed repentance&mdash;long ago that was all <lb/>
done, and peace with God was hers."</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">May</hi> 15.&mdash;I am weighed down sometimes with <lb/>
the sense of responsibility and short-coming. With this <lb/>
crushing feeling I was coming home this evening, taking <lb/>
my Saturday's review of the past week, but as I came <lb/>
near our gate, the lovely scene before me seemed to lift <lb/>
off the load of care; the church and trees behind it were <lb/>
bathed in a heavenly flood of light, the rays of the <lb/>
setting sun; it seemed unearthly; I almost listened for <lb/>
the angels' songs, but a sweeter note perchance to flesh <lb/>
and blood was the assurance brought home by the scene, <lb/>
of a loving Friend who is touched with the feeling of <lb/>
His people's infirmities. I do not the less feel my own <lb/>
short-comings, but I feel in my weakness the strength <lb/>
engaged for me; the sweet promise, 'All that the Father <lb/>
giveth Me shall come to Me;' <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> come, however far <lb/>
short human instrumentality falls of their need. His <lb/>
crown shall not want a jewel, but if believers do not live <lb/>
up to their privileges, if they tire and faint, their crowns <lb/>
may be less bright because they will not avail themselves <lb/>
of the honour He allows them, of being His instruments <lb/>
in winning souls."</p>
<pb n="37" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0054"/>
<p>God's word was indeed the rule of her life and her <lb/>
daily study. With her it was no mere reading of a few <lb/>
chapters, but searching the Scriptures, comparing passage <lb/>
with passage, and storing her heart and memory with the <lb/>
truths she thus learned. Her Aunt Esther gave her a <lb/>
Treasury Bible. She thus notices it in her journal:&mdash;</p>
<p>"This morning came Aunt E.'s birthday gift, a <lb/>
Treasury Bible; a new talent given to me; Lord, give <lb/>
me grace to read it aright. And do bless the kind and <lb/>
loving giver, and enable me more and more to show my <lb/>
love to her."</p>
<p>She afterwards wrote to a friend: "Aunt E. has <lb/>
always loved me very much, but she never did anything <lb/>
for me half so valuable as when she gave me that Bible."</p>
<p>We will now pass to the home life of this Christian <lb/>
woman, and here again we must express our obligations <lb/>
to her sister's affectionate "Memorials."</p>
<p>"Visitors in the house saw the simple unaffected girl <lb/>
so quiet and unpretending, though ever lady-like and <lb/>
cheerful, and knew nothing of the deep inner life which <lb/>
was the motive power of her consistent walk. But they <lb/>
could not fail to see that while her days were spent <lb/>
among the poor, no home duty was ever neglected, and <lb/>
her mother's slightest wish would at all times make her <lb/>
give up her own plans. Long before the party assembled <lb/>
in the breakfast-room, Agnes might be seen returning <lb/>
from the garden laden with flowers, which she delighted <lb/>
to arrange in the sitting-rooms with a skill and taste <lb/>
quite peculiar to herself. If the servants happened not <lb/>
<pb n="38" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0055"/>
to be sufficiently skilful to undertake all that was required, <lb/>
she would spend hours in the kitchen preparing <reg orig="con-|fectionary">confectionary</reg>, <lb/>
etc.; and when my mother came down in the <lb/>
morning to give orders, she frequently found that Agnes <lb/>
had been busily engaged from five o'clock, and that all <lb/>
was prepared. In all the arrangements of the farm and <lb/>
garden she took the greatest interest, and was ever <lb/>
ready to do anything to help my mother, and save her <lb/>
from anxiety and fatigue. On first coming to Fahan I <lb/>
find from her journals it had been sometimes a great <lb/>
trial to her to give up her visiting of the poor when <lb/>
guests at home required her attention, and she even <lb/>
questioned with herself how far it was right to yield <lb/>
the point, but it was not long before her peculiarly and <lb/>
calm judging mind had discerned where the line was <lb/>
to be drawn; and it was often a marvel to those who <lb/>
knew where her heart lay, to see with what cheerfulness <lb/>
she would devote herself to the amusement of the friends <lb/>
and relatives who visited us during the summer months <lb/>
A year and a half after my mother and she Agnes <lb/>
returned to Fahan House, I had been left a widow <lb/>
and once more joined the home circle. Those only <lb/>
who knew the deep tenderness of dear Agnes' <unclear id="u2">characters</unclear> <lb/>
and the intense love she ever bore me, could guess <unclear id="u3">are</unclear> <lb/>
the affectionate sympathy with which she watched over <lb/>
me at that time, and how with gentle persuasion she <lb/>
drew me on to join in walks and visits to the poor; the <lb/>
desire to give me an interest again in life making her <lb/>
forget her timidity, and admit me even to her <reg orig="Bible-|readings">Bible-readings</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="39" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0056"/>
in the cottages, where I learned many a lesson <lb/>
from her simple practical teaching."</p>
<p>In 1860 she was again at Kaiserswerth, and her <lb/>
longing for work there was about to be gratified. The <lb/>
time had now come when the happy county and home <lb/>
life was to be left, and a wider sphere of usefulness <lb/>
entered. She had for some time been looking pale and <lb/>
thin, yet she could not be induced to take rest, or in <lb/>
any way relax her Christian exertions on behalf of the <lb/>
poor. An uncle who had come to his home in Ireland <lb/>
for a few weeks, was to rejoin his family in Germany and <lb/>
one morning it was suggested at the breakfast-table that <lb/>
this might be an opportunity for paying her long-<reg orig="talked-|of">talked-of</reg> <lb/>
visit to Kaiserswerth, availing herself of his escort <lb/>
for the journey. At first she seemed to think it <reg orig="impos-|sible">impossible</reg> <lb/>
she could leave her sick and poor; but in a day <lb/>
or two she spoke of it again, and said she might learn <lb/>
there much that would be useful in the parish; so it was <lb/>
settled that she should go. My mother and I rejoiced <lb/>
at her being thus forced away from the long mountain <lb/>
walks which we felt were too much for her strength, and <lb/>
hoped the complete change of air and scene would <lb/>
restore her failing health. Little did we think she was <lb/>
never again to be with us except on passing visits. Her <lb/>
arrival at Kaiserswerth she thus describes:&mdash;</p>
<p>"So we came to the door of the hospital. I was left <lb/>
in the hall till some one should find what was to be <lb/>
done with me; after a long wait a summons came to the <lb/>
pastor's house; the mother came in and said I should <lb/>
<pb n="40" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0057"/>
live in the hospital, in the sisters' part, and so brought <lb/>
me over and gave me in charge to Sister Sophia, the <lb/>
head of the hospital. She led me to a dear little room, <lb/>
the window opening on the garden, across which I see <lb/>
the orphan and the pastor's house. After a little I <lb/>
was taken to Sister Reichardt's room, where I sat and <lb/>
talked till 12 o'clock dinner; then my luggage arrived. <lb/>
I unpacked and dressed and went with Sister Dorothea <lb/>
to the women's hospital; Sister Carietten came to take <lb/>
me over part of the house,&mdash;the women and children's <lb/>
wards, workrooms, kitchens, bakery, etc. Coffee at 2 <lb/>
in my room, and then with Sister D. to see the wounds <lb/>
dressed in the hospital. At 7 tea, returned to my room <lb/>
and at 9 prayers."</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Friday.</hi>&mdash;Breakfast was brought to me at 6 o'clock. <lb/>
Afterwards I went to the women's hospital and spent the <lb/>
day there."</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Saturday.</hi>&mdash;Prayers at 7, then to women's <reg orig="hos-|pital">hospital</reg>; <lb/>
dressed some wounds, etc. Sister Dorothea, of <lb/>
whom I am sure I should have grown very fond, went <lb/>
off to replace a sister at Graefeld Almshouse for sick <lb/>
and old. After dinner I paid Sister Sophia a visit in <lb/>
her room, and was told to be ready at 3, dressed <lb/>
in black for the funeral of Sister Joanna, who died on <lb/>
Wednesday, and for whom the bells have been rung <lb/>
daily from 12 to 1 o'clock. Sister Maria came for me; <lb/>
we found the deaconesses assembling in the yard, <lb/>
where was the coffin with six bright silvery-looking <lb/>
handles, and surrounded with a long wreath of cypress <lb/>
<pb n="41" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0058"/>
and white dahlias. After a little Pastor Disselhof <lb/>
&lpar;Louisa Fliedner's husband&rpar;, came and told the <reg orig="deacon-|esses">deaconesses</reg>, <lb/>
before leaving, what they were to sing. They <lb/>
sang four verses standing as they were; then the town <lb/>
children walked on, the pastors, six men carrying the <lb/>
coffin, other men and the band; then the deaconesses <lb/>
and others, three and three, singing and moving slowly <lb/>
we came to the 'Gottesacker;' round the grave we stood, <lb/>
&mdash;the open grave with the coffin laid in it; a hymn was <lb/>
given out and sung, and then Pastor Disselhof, as if <lb/>
blessing the grave with uplifted hands, repeated, 'Oh <lb/>
death, where is thy sting?' He then read Luke vii. <lb/>
11&ndash;16, and spoke first of the scenes of this <reg orig="week&mdash;Mon-|day">week&mdash;Monday</reg> <lb/>
and Tuesday such a joyful feast, the anniversary of <lb/>
the beginning of the Institution, when so many pastors, <lb/>
strangers, and every deaconess who can come, gather <lb/>
together and have such rejoicing. Now the last day of <lb/>
the week, Sister Joanna's funeral, reminding us that in <lb/>
the midst of life we are in death; but this is also a <lb/>
joyful thing when we think of her now, and we may take <lb/>
the text for the day, 'Weep not,' as our consolation. <lb/>
After giving the reasons why we need not weep, he told <lb/>
the story of her life&mdash;her father's death, her work for her <lb/>
mother and young brother, her confirmation and taking <lb/>
God from that day as hers,&mdash;not a sudden change, but <lb/>
a growing change, as sure as the growth of a living tree; <lb/>
then her school change from that at Kaiserswerth for <lb/>
awhile, change again to Elburg; but she ever said her <lb/>
heart was here. Her whole heart was in her work&mdash;her <lb/>
<pb n="42" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0059"/>
day-school, her teaching of the people in after hours, <lb/>
her Sunday-school, numbering 100 at least; her sorrow <lb/>
that she could give little at Christmas made her, though <lb/>
very shy, go every year from home begging and getting <lb/>
a great deal, enough to clothe her children. In the <lb/>
mention of sister Joanna, they always speak of her as <lb/>
the 'home-gone sister.'"</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Sunday.</hi>&mdash;The preparation for next Sunday's <reg orig="com-|munion">communion</reg>. <lb/>
Read at prayers at a quarter to seven, 1 Cor. <lb/>
xi. 13. Sister Carietten prayed that this Sunday might <lb/>
be a day of growth &ndash; of being clothed anew in Christ's <lb/>
righteousness,&mdash;a day in which we might more entirely <lb/>
give ourselves to Jesus, and feel what a blessed thing it <lb/>
is to live for Him, to work for Him, to devote our <lb/>
strength to Him who first loved us and gave Himself <lb/>
for us. I helped to dress some of the wounds; then <lb/>
church at a quarter before 10. They first sang, then <lb/>
read the same epistle and gospel as our own, then <lb/>
Prov. vii., then a prayer, after which those were desired <lb/>
to remain who wished to receive the communion next <lb/>
Sunday. The Lord's Prayer and the beautiful Levitical <lb/>
blessing closed the service. Soon after, the sister came <lb/>
with an invitation from the pastor for me to dine with <lb/>
him, which I did at 12. He spoke little, for his cough <lb/>
is very severe; first the text for the day was read, <lb/>
then the psalm by his children, and dinner began&mdash;soup, <lb/>
plates of gruel, which was sweet with raisins in it, then <lb/>
boiled meat, beans and potatoes, afterwards fresh plums. <lb/>
After dinner the pastor gave one of his sons a poem to <lb/>
<pb n="43" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0060"/>
read aloud; he read a few short missionary anecdotes, <lb/>
and we sang a hymn before grace was said, The pastor <lb/>
told me I might, after service at the village church, go <lb/>
out with the parish sister on her rounds."</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Tuesday.</hi>&mdash;Breakfast and prayers, attending patients <lb/>
and sitting with them. Afterwards went with Sisters <lb/>
Emilie and Frederica to the churchyard; saw the spot <lb/>
the pastor has chosen for himself, and also the sisters' <lb/>
graves, a stone with name, age, date of death, and a text, <lb/>
headed by a dove flying among stars. At two, the <lb/>
'Lied Stunde,' which is Sister Carietten explaining the <lb/>
scripture references to the hymns; then Sister R.'s class <lb/>
on 2 Tim. iii.; then I went back with her to her room <lb/>
for a talk; then to the sick, and helped in the <reg orig="dress-|ings">dressings</reg>, <lb/>
etc., till after 6."</p>
<p>In a letter home she says,&mdash;</p>
<p>"I am as happy here as the day is long, and it does <lb/>
not seem half long enough, but with all my contentment, <lb/>
till your letter came yesterday there was something <lb/>
wanting. Except a little with sister Lebussa&mdash;a countess <lb/>
who is nursing-sister here, and who speaks English well <lb/>
&mdash;it is German all day, and I think I am improving. <lb/>
Every one is so busy here, one can't spend much <lb/>
time talking, but, had you seen our lively walking <lb/>
party to-day, you would not have feared my being <lb/>
moped."</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">October</hi> 1.&mdash;Sister C. came to see my room to-day, <lb/>
she said, 'I like its number, 103, it reminds me of the <lb/>
103rd Psalm.' I thanked her in my heart for the word. <lb/>
<pb n="44" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0061"/>
Truly I can say, 'Forget not all His benefits;' how <lb/>
many and great they are."</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Tuesday.</hi>&mdash;Found my dress in my room on returning <lb/>
from Pastor D.'s class; as soon as ready I went to show <lb/>
myself to Sister Sophie, and ask for my new name, <lb/>
'Sister Agnes.' She said she would take me this <reg orig="even-|ing">evening</reg> <lb/>
to the men's hospital, so, after giving my English <lb/>
lesson, I went to her. Sister M. in the wards is different <lb/>
from any sister I have yet come in contact with, but she <lb/>
seems very hardy, and well fitted for her post. I hope I <lb/>
may learn much from her. I go with trembling, but it <lb/>
encourages me to feel I have made friends here, in the <lb/>
sorrow of the sisters and patients in the wards I am <lb/>
leaving."</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">October</hi> 3.&mdash;In the morning helped in the female <lb/>
ward, till breakfast. At 7 to the men's hospital. <lb/>
Sister M., to my great delight, put me at once to work; <lb/>
first washing the glasses, etc., used by the patients <reg orig="dur-|ing">during</reg> <lb/>
the night, then dusting and washing furniture in the <lb/>
bedrooms, seeing the dressing of the wounds, etc., <reg orig="wash-|ing">washing</reg> <lb/>
up of breakfast things, and then I was sent to sit in <lb/>
the room with a dying man. Could I have chosen my <lb/>
work, it would have been this; but, oh, how I longed for <lb/>
words! and yet I feared to speak, partly because he was <lb/>
too weak for the exertion of mind to understand me; <lb/>
partly, because I was unwilling he should know my <lb/>
ignorance of the language, lest he should be nervous at <lb/>
the thought of my not understanding his wants. But I <lb/>
could pray for him, and it was so sweet to think One was <lb/>
<pb n="45" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0062"/>
there who could do all without my help, and who could <lb/>
hear my prayer, and answer the sick man's oft-repeated <lb/>
cry, 'Lieber Heiland, hilf mich!' His constant cough <lb/>
was very distressing, yet he scarcely seemed to me so <lb/>
near death as they think him. After dinner returned to <lb/>
my post. At 2, Pastor S.'s class, then my English <lb/>
lesson, and then to men's hospital again till 7; after tea, <lb/>
visited sister G., and then to the female wards to say <lb/>
good-night to my friends."</p>
<p>We here get graphic glimpses of the training she was <lb/>
undergoing at this German institution, and which was to <lb/>
bear fruit in English hospitals and workhouses, after <lb/>
being for some time with the Bible-women. To perfect <lb/>
still further her hospital training, she entered St. Thomas's <lb/>
hospital for a year's training. While there she went <lb/>
through all the training of a nurse. "Her reports of <lb/>
cases," says Miss Nightingale, "were admirable as to <lb/>
nursing details. She was our best pupil; she went <lb/>
through all the work of a soldier, and she thereby fitted <lb/>
herself for being the best general we ever had. Many a <lb/>
time, in her after life at the workhouse, she wrote, that <lb/>
without her training in St. Thomas's Hospital she could <lb/>
have done nothing. "Dear fellow countrywomen," <reg orig="con-|tinues">continues</reg> <lb/>
Miss Nightingale, "if any of you are unwilling to <lb/>
leave a loved and happy home, if any of you are <reg orig="un-|willing">unwilling</reg> <lb/>
to give up a beloved daughter or sister, know that <lb/>
this servant of God had a home as fair and happy as any, <lb/>
which she loved beyond all created things, and that her <lb/>
mother and sister gave her up to do God's work!"</p>
<pb n="46" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0063"/>
<p>In 1865 she found herself as superintendent of the <lb/>
nurses at the Liverpool workhouse, and here she did <lb/>
some wonderful Christian work. Here on the 19th <lb/>
February, 1868, she was seized with fever while <reg orig="minister-|ing">ministering</reg> <lb/>
to the wants of some poor fever-stricken patients, <lb/>
and cut off all too soon for her noble work, and while <lb/>
still comparatively young. When dying at the workhouse <lb/>
infirmary&mdash;at her humane post, indeed&mdash;one of the <lb/>
nurses whispered to her, "You'll soon be with Jesus." <lb/>
She said, "Yes, I'll be better there&mdash;" After some <lb/>
time she opened her eyes, no dulness there; they <lb/>
looked bright and beautiful; she looked round as if she <lb/>
knew the faces, then on her aunt with such a loving <lb/>
expression, and "auntie" was her last word. The <lb/>
breathing became slower, then longer intervals between; <lb/>
at last it ceased, and she was with Jesus, whom she so <lb/>
loved, and so faithfully served. "Her countenance," <lb/>
wrote her aunt to her mother, whose health would not <lb/>
permit her to travel from Fahan to Liverpool, "was the <lb/>
most beautiful I ever saw after life had departed&mdash;the <lb/>
bright sunny expression&mdash;truly perfect peace; more than <lb/>
peace, joy."</p>
<p>On February 25th, 1868, her dear father's grave in <lb/>
Fahan churchyard was opened to receive the remains of <lb/>
this great and godly woman. Her grave was surrounded, <lb/>
first, by rows of school-children&mdash;behind them, on one <lb/>
side the young women, on the other the young men of <lb/>
her Bible classes&mdash;and behind these again the elder <lb/>
women and men with whom she had read and prayed. <lb/>
<pb n="47" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0064"/>
She lay, after the service, completely strewn with <reg orig="prim-|roses">primroses</reg> <lb/>
and snowdrops showered upon her coffin. It is <lb/>
proposed to erect on the spot where she died perhaps <lb/>
the grandest religious statue ever sculptured by mortal <lb/>
hands&mdash;Tenerani's Angel of the Resurrection&mdash;as a fitting <lb/>
memorial of her work, and a type of the hope to come. <lb/>
She was cut off in the midst of heavy labours, having <lb/>
under her charge above 50 nurses and probationers, <lb/>
above 150 pauper scourers, from 1,290 to 1,350 patients, <lb/>
being from 200 to 300 more than the number of beds. <lb/>
All this she had to provide for and arrange for, often <lb/>
receiving an influx of patients without a moment's <lb/>
warning.</p>
<p>A monument to her memory has been erected in the <lb/>
parish church of Fahan, which consists of a tablet of <lb/>
pure Carrara marble, supported by brackets, and capped <lb/>
by a moulded cornice, which bears the following <reg orig="inscrip-|tion:&mdash;">inscription:&mdash;</reg></p>
<p>"The Master is come and calleth for thee,&mdash;John vi. <lb/>
28. Erected by the Minister and People of Fahan <lb/>
and their Bishop, in memory of Agnes Elizabeth Jones, <lb/>
formerly of this parish. Born 10th November, 1832. <lb/>
Cut off by fever, 19th February, 1868." Underneath <lb/>
the inscription are the following beautiful lines, the <lb/>
composition of the Lord Bishop of Derry:&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"Alone with Christ in this sequester'd place</l>
<l>Thy meek soul learn'd its quietude of grace;</l>
<l>On sufferers waiting in this vale of ours,</l>
<l>Thy gifted touch was trained to finer powers,</l>
<pb n="48" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0065"/>
<l>Therefore, when death, O Agnes! came to thee&mdash;</l>
<l>Not in the cool breath of our silver sea,</l>
<l>But in the city hospital's hot ward</l>
<l>A gentle worker for the gentle Lord&mdash;</l>
<l>Proudly, as men heroic ashes claim,</l>
<l>We ask'd to have thy fever-stricken frame,</l>
<l>And lay it in our grass, beside our foam,</l>
<l>Till Christ the Healer calls His sisters home."</l>

<figure id="f7" rend="block" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0066"/>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Another</hi> Christian labourer in the Temperance <lb/>
Cause, is Lady Hope, whom, like many other silent <lb/>
workers, we must be content to know by her works as <lb/>
a staunch Bible-woman and as a great and able <reg orig="sup-|porter">supporter</reg> <lb/>
of coffee-halls for working men. This lady in <lb/>
a volume she has just published, "Lines of Light on a <lb/>
Dark Background," gives us some invaluable experiences <lb/>
amongst the intemperate at Dorking. In her <reg orig="introduc-|tory">introductory</reg> <lb/>
chapter she says:&mdash;</p>
<p>"While reviewing the temperance history of this <lb/>
country during the past two or three years, one finds <lb/>
cause for lament, as well as much cause indeed for <lb/>
thankfulness. We rejoice in the spread of temperance; <lb/>
we lament in such large proportion its divorce from <lb/>
all that is godly. So that, while we feel disposed to <lb/>
congratulate the movers in these great and successful <lb/>
schemes, we also would entreat, in the name of <hi rend="italic">the <lb/>
people</hi> that our great national temperance reforms may <lb/>
not even <hi rend="italic">appear</hi> to be inconsistent with the highest code <lb/>
of morality offered to us, namely the Scripture.</p>
<p>"Why should we consider it necessary to banish the <lb/>
<pb n="50" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0067"/>
Bible because we desire success in our effort amongst <lb/>
the working-classes? It is to be feared that we shall <lb/>
teach the masses to imagine that <hi rend="italic">God is not with us</hi> in <lb/>
the temperance reforms which we are striving to effect; <lb/>
and 'Without <hi rend="italic">Me</hi> ye can do nothing,' says our Christ.</p>
<p>"The standard of Christianity is the glory of our <lb/>
land; her very mottoes reveal this as a great and <reg orig="un-|dying">undying</reg> <lb/>
fact. If we think that this banner is objected to <lb/>
by the middle and lower classes, we are mistaken; the <lb/>
idea is chimerical. The Book has power to fascinate&mdash; <lb/>
to delight. The large print New Testament carries with <lb/>
it its own charm, gives them happier days; and <hi rend="italic">many a <lb/>
time</hi> it has breathed comfort into aching, weary hearts.</p>
<p>"Texts on the wall do wonders in checking bad <lb/>
language, and controlling the thousand evils that will <lb/>
crop up in any large assemblage of working men who <lb/>
are spending their evenings together, their former <reg orig="inter-|course">intercourse</reg> <lb/>
having been within the tainted atmosphere of the <lb/>
public-house."</p>
<p>Further on writes Lady Hope:&mdash;</p>
<p>"In our temperance meetings, halls, saloons, we <lb/>
cannot go too far in exalting the name of Christ. He is <lb/>
our great Leader in every cause for good. Let us go <lb/>
forth in His strength and with His blessing, and we <lb/>
shall surely prosper."</p>
<p>In her chapter on coffee-halls she thus bears her <lb/>
testimony to their value in reclaiming the drunkard, and <lb/>
keeping him out of temptation:&mdash;</p>
<p>"'We pass the drink at every turn,' said a <reg orig="working-|man">workingman</reg>, <lb/>
<pb n="51" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0068"/>
and he spoke as one of many. 'We smell it, we <lb/>
see it, we taste it, and how can we help becoming <lb/>
drunkards?'</p>
<p>"'Do get coffee for us in the houses all down the <lb/>
street, and beside the country roads, and we'll <hi rend="italic">never</hi> <lb/>
drink beer or spirits! We have had <hi rend="italic">enough of that <lb/>
lush!</hi>' said another.</p>
<p>"'I went out this morning,' said a third, 'quite <lb/>
determined that I would never drink another drop of <lb/>
beer. But at my work I got dreadful thirsty and I <lb/>
asked at the nearest public-house for a cup of tea; but <lb/>
the publican's wife, she scorned me! and so I had to <lb/>
drink some ditch-water out of a roadside pond. The <lb/>
publican he found me out, and before I knew where I <lb/>
was, a lot of his <hi rend="italic">own</hi> were upon me, and the beer was <lb/>
being poured down my throat.'</p>
<p>"From that day," says Lady Hope, "this fine, <reg orig="manly-|looking">manly-looking</reg> <lb/>
young fellow became, in spite of all his better <lb/>
aspirations, a heavy drinker to the heart-breaking sorrow <lb/>
of his aged mother. Many a time he would give <reg orig="utter-|ance">utterance</reg> <lb/>
to sorrowful expostulations with us on our being <lb/>
so quiet about them publicans, when they were doing <lb/>
such a deal of mischief, saying, '<hi rend="small-caps">Why</hi> can't we get <lb/>
other drinks besides that beer when we are at our work? <lb/>
But,' he would add, sorrowfully shaking his head, <lb/>
'there's always plenty of beer or spirits to hand, go <lb/>
where you will!' His reproaches were only too true, <lb/>
and we were silenced; and so the better and reforming <lb/>
portion of our community <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be silent while this <lb/>
<pb n="52" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0069"/>
iniquitous, wholesale traffic of drinks, that tends so <lb/>
directly to the immediate degradation of the people, <lb/>
continues almost unchecked, and generally ever <reg orig="un-|opposed">unopposed</reg>.</p>
<p>"The misery depicted in the hearts and lives of those <lb/>
who frequent the drink-shops ought to make us, as <lb/>
Christians, very careful about giving encouragement to <lb/>
so deadly a practice as that of trifling with intoxicating <lb/>
liquor. Many a time poor women have expressed their <lb/>
dread at seeing their husbands enter the hospital, for <lb/>
fear of the beer or brandy likely to be prescribed; the <lb/>
wife, perhaps, having been witness to the long struggle <lb/>
of <hi rend="italic">resistance,</hi> before her husband could again be <reg orig="con-|sidered">considered</reg> <lb/>
a sober and respectable man, dreading the <lb/>
prescription that <hi rend="italic">might</hi> so easily throw him back again <lb/>
into the misery from which he had with such difficulty <lb/>
escaped. These precautionary fears, however, are not <lb/>
always to be found on the part of the women. On the <lb/>
contrary, they are often far too willing to take and offer <lb/>
the spirituous dose.</p>
<p>"Not long ago" &lpar;continues Lady Hope, in her useful <lb/>
and interesting volume&rpar; "I went into a cottage, where I <lb/>
heard that an old man was suffering from an accident. <lb/>
Two of his ribs had been broken. There I found him, <lb/>
lying under a counterpane, it is true, in his rough <lb/>
working-jacket, the daughter having been desired by <lb/>
the doctor not to let him be undressed; and there he <lb/>
lay, the very picture of wretched discomfort, for many <lb/>
days.</p>
<pb n="53" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0070"/>
<p>"Whenever I visited him I found the daughter, herself <lb/>
a married woman and the mother of children, handing <lb/>
to him a spouted cup. 'Drink it,' she always said; <lb/>
'it will do you good.'</p>
<p>"'What is it?' I asked one day, 'that you give him <lb/>
so often to do him good?' Seeing her hesitate, I asked <lb/>
whether the draught was <hi rend="italic">whisky?</hi></p>
<p>"'Yes!' I was right. It was nothing else.</p>
<p>"'How <hi rend="italic">can</hi> you give him such a thing as this?' I <lb/>
inquired, 'when you could get both milk, or anything <lb/>
you liked from the house close by.'</p>
<p>"'Oh, it is very good! It gives him a <hi rend="italic">false spirit</hi>,' <lb/>
she replied.</p>
<p>"'<hi rend="small-caps">A false spirit</hi>!' I repeated, in horror.</p>
<p>"'Yes!' she continued, 'the doctor said it would do <lb/>
for both meat and medicine for him.'</p>
<p>"This false spirit," comments our author, "has now <lb/>
obtained a power in our land which none but the Holy <lb/>
Spirit of God is able to overcome. No doubt many a <lb/>
drunkard is <hi rend="italic">made</hi> such by the quiet indulgence of their <lb/>
liberal prescriptions, first in his own house, and then <lb/>
&mdash;after the love for them is acquired&mdash;at the <reg orig="public-|house">public-house</reg>."</p>
<p>But the ruinous evils of intemperance are unhappily <lb/>
too well known to dwell upon them. What is the <lb/>
remedy? That is the question that every one interested <lb/>
in the amelioration of the wretched vice should address <lb/>
to himself. Lady Hope, who has worked hard and <reg orig="suc-|cessfully">successfully</reg> <lb/>
in the temperance cause, looks with great favour <lb/>
<pb n="54" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0071"/>
on the coffee-hall system, which is now springing up in <lb/>
our midst, and she gives substantial evidence of its value.</p>
<p>"A budget of letters," she says in the book we quote <lb/>
from, "lies before me, each containing sentences that <lb/>
testify to the writer's history of a twofold life, and all <lb/>
written at different times and under different <reg orig="circum-|stances">circumstances</reg>, <lb/>
from hearts full of gratitude and love to the <lb/>
Good Shepherd, who had traced, followed, sought, and <lb/>
found His wandering sheep.</p>
<p>"The first that I happen to take up is from one of <lb/>
the lads in our obstreperous class, mentioned in the <lb/>
earlier part of 'Our Coffee Room.' It was written after <lb/>
I had left Surrey, and refers to a return visit I had <lb/>
paid a short time afterwards. In the interval W. had <lb/>
become a married man, steady, and well-conducted; <lb/>
though always one of our warm friends and hearty <reg orig="sup-|porters">supporters</reg>, <lb/>
and a very regular attendant at the rooms and <lb/>
meetings, yet having an occasional slip or stumble, which <lb/>
caused us anxiety, and made him by no means the <lb/>
faultless example that we wished to see him.</p>
<p>"For some time before his marriage, however, we <lb/>
were consoled by the great improvement manifest in his <lb/>
conduct, and also by the increased earnestness of his <lb/>
Christian character. On the occasion of the visit I <lb/>
have mentioned, I had called at his house, finding only <lb/>
his wife at home, and had been shown with much <lb/>
delight a Bible presented to her W. by some of his <lb/>
friends. W. writes:&mdash;</p>
<p>"'I thank you for your kind letter, and also the <lb/>
<pb n="55" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0072"/>
markers that you sent me for my large Bible. I was <lb/>
very glad you came to see my home before you went <lb/>
back. I told my wife she ought to have shown you <lb/>
upstairs,' &lpar;to display the bedrooms, which, no doubt, <lb/>
judging by the downstairs apartments, were a pattern <lb/>
of cleanliness and neatness&rpar;, 'but I hope you will come <lb/>
again and see us whenever you come back to D. I <lb/>
thank God that He gave me such a happy home. I <lb/>
have much to thank you for, too, for I believe I should <lb/>
have been one of the wildest, wickedest fellows in the <lb/>
world, had not God given you so much patience in <lb/>
trying to lead me in that narrow path which leads to <lb/>
everlasting life. How many times I have tried to get <lb/>
out of your way! But you would not let me rest in <lb/>
sin and wickedness; and I thank God that He did not <lb/>
cut me off in my sins. We have had a good large <lb/>
Bible-class lately.'"</p>
<p>Such letters as these must have been a great reward <lb/>
to Lady Hope, and an encouragement to pursue her <lb/>
Christian course in reclaiming the unhappy fallen.</p>
<p>"The next letter is from a man who, at our first <lb/>
acquaintance with him, was one of the worst of roughs, <lb/>
and deplorably ignorant, but who afterwards became one <lb/>
of our most valuable helpers. A short time ago he <lb/>
undertook the charge of a coffee-barrow, which, having <lb/>
proved successful, he here expresses a desire for the <lb/>
enlargement of his operations:&mdash;</p>
<p>"'I am getting on very successful with my work, and <lb/>
think, with a little more persuading, Mr.<gap desc="long dash" reason="missing" id="g1"/>' &lpar;his <reg orig="super-|intendent&rpar;">superintendent&rpar;</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="56" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0073"/>
'will build me a room, as he is so taken up <lb/>
with the way wherein I do the work. I hope that when <lb/>
you write back you will write a little encouraging piece, <lb/>
so that I may show it to them. Mrs.<gap desc="long dash" reason="missing" id="g2"/>' &lpar;the lady <lb/>
who audits his accounts&rpar; 'told me this morning she had <lb/>
got &pound;9 in hand from me in five weeks. So I think I <lb/>
ought to have a room now, for it is more than I can <lb/>
do with the coffee-stall properly. You know I told you <lb/>
I had made a little place behind it, and Mr.<gap desc="long dash" reason="missing" id="g3"/> gave <lb/>
me a lot of books to give to men, and they take such <lb/>
an interest in it. I get the place quite filled up all <lb/>
round. I have a great deal to thank the Lord for on <lb/>
account of the coffee-barrow, for He has answered our <lb/>
prayers most abundantly, from 4<hi rend="italic">s.</hi> 6<hi rend="italic">d.</hi> a day up to &pound;2 <lb/>
or &pound;3; and more than that, I have got so used to the <lb/>
men, that I can speak to any of them now.'</p>
<p>"Since the receipt of this letter," writes Lady Hope, <lb/>
"the Vicar of the parish where the coffee-stall has been <lb/>
carrying on its successful trade has written to tell me <lb/>
that K. has obtained his wish, an iron room having <lb/>
been erected for the use of the coffee-barrow customers. <lb/>
He also tells me that in <hi rend="italic">nine months</hi> K.'s gross <lb/>
receipts have been no less than &pound;300! proving both <lb/>
the vigour of the salesman and the popularity of his <lb/>
wares; but above all, the blessing that can be given <lb/>
from our Father to any effort made in believing prayer <lb/>
and humble dependence upon His promised word.</p>
<p>The following excellent hints on establishing a village <lb/>
coffee-room by one person is well worth attention:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Large halls would require far too large an outlay for <lb/>
the ordinary purse of a single individual, and many of <lb/>
these coffee-houses are being started by those who are <lb/>
by no means wealthy. This is true, but many of these <lb/>
coffee-houses <hi rend="small-caps">fail</hi> <hi rend="italic">because</hi> they are begun with too small <lb/>
an outlay at first, and are stinted continuously of the <lb/>
many charms and comforts to the working man&mdash;<hi rend="italic">luxuries</hi> <lb/>
which, were they made use of, would prove so successful <lb/>
an attraction to him.</p>
<p>On the other hand, when I say 'large halls,' I am <lb/>
suggesting the <hi rend="small-caps">best</hi> method of entertaining the working <lb/>
man in the evenings, and thinking of enterprise suitable <lb/>
for the consideration of gentlemen, who might form on <lb/>
this plan a Mission Coffee-hall Company. But though, <lb/>
in planning a village coffee-room, or a similar <reg orig="under-|taking">undertaking</reg>, <lb/>
by one person and where funds were limited, one <lb/>
would not suggest a scheme of this description on any <lb/>
but a moderate scale, the <hi rend="italic">theory</hi> holds good, the project <lb/>
is the same. Do not rent a small house full of little <lb/>
rooms, but rent a long empty warehouse or shed, or erect <lb/>
a movable wooden room, larched inside, and capable of <lb/>
holding not less than seventy or eighty men comfortably <lb/>
seated at tables. One good-sized room, or two rooms <lb/>
adjoining one another, each about 30 by 20 feet, the one <lb/>
for coffee, games, and reading, and the other for classes <lb/>
and readings or meetings, are far preferable in every <lb/>
way to the 'little house' so commonly and mistakenly <lb/>
engaged for this purpose. Three obvious reasons show <lb/>
the disadvantages of the small-roomed house.</p>
<pb n="58" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0075"/>
<p>1st. It gives the men no pleasure to find themselves <lb/>
in a little room, where they can scarcely move, and where <lb/>
they cannot invite their friends, because there can be no <lb/>
conversation that is not heard by all present.</p>
<p>2nd. The manager must have full sight and control of <lb/>
all the men in the house, or quarrelling, bad language, <lb/>
and other disorders may occur.</p>
<p>3rd. The little rooms preclude the entrance of hundreds <lb/>
of men who would willingly be customers were there <lb/>
space and freedom offered to them, and the best <reg orig="attrac-|tions">attractions</reg> <lb/>
provided.</p>
<p>A very rough shed, provided it be air and water tight, <lb/>
can be made extremely pretty and home-like by the <lb/>
skilful arrangement of large texts made of bright blue <lb/>
letters on white calico, the coloured pictures published <lb/>
so cheaply by the Tract Society, and engravings from <lb/>
the <hi rend="italic">Graphic</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Illustrated London News,</hi> bordered by <lb/>
an inch of crimson paper, and fastened on the wall by <lb/>
means of brass-headed nails. One naturally lays great <lb/>
stress on decoration, however humble the materials, <lb/>
because we are all creatures of sight, and are aware <reg orig="im-|mediately">immediately</reg> <lb/>
we enter a room of a sense of comfort and <lb/>
brightness, or the reverse. One of the most successful <lb/>
rooms of this kind that I know was once a large <reg orig="dancing-|hall">dancing-hall</reg>, <lb/>
its walls sodden with age and dirt, its windows <lb/>
opaque with dust and cobwebs. It was known as one <lb/>
of the worst haunts in a little town, until at last its <lb/>
notoriety caused its sudden collapse through a judicial <lb/>
mandate carried into effect by the police.</p>
<pb n="59" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0076"/>
<p>At this point of its existence, it was discovered, <lb/>
rented for a small sum, and cleaned throughout; when, <lb/>
happily, the painting and whitewashing that it then <lb/>
received caused so great a metamorphosis in its <reg orig="appear-|ance">appearance</reg> <lb/>
that its most frequent attendants of former times <lb/>
said in their surprise, "We should not know it again!" <lb/>
After an interval of two or three months it was opened <lb/>
as a coffee-saloon on the principles above described. <lb/>
Seventy representative working men were invited, and <lb/>
the objects of the undertaking explained. After <reg orig="listen-|ing">listening</reg> <lb/>
attentively to the future programme of the old room, <lb/>
they were appealed to for their united support, and the <lb/>
reply was unanimous. Their eager faces and loud <reg orig="ap-|plause">applause</reg> <lb/>
showed their appreciation of the benefit <reg orig="con-|ferred">conferred</reg>, <lb/>
and promised their hearty co-operation. But the <lb/>
most sanguine of its supporters were scarcely prepared <lb/>
for the rush of visitors that followed upon that evening. <lb/>
Night after night the numbers of customers steadily <lb/>
increased. Hours they spend there in the greatest <lb/>
delight. Simple though their enjoyments are, and <lb/>
unmarred by excitement of any kind, it is none the <lb/>
less real. <hi rend="italic">Crowded</hi> though that room is in every corner, <lb/>
standing as well as sitting space occupied for many hours <lb/>
on a Saturday evening, and for a shorter time on other <lb/>
nights, yet the gentle control of an excellent manager is <lb/>
sufficient, without difficulty, to preserve perfect order. <lb/>
No bad language, no angry disputes disturb the <reg orig="even-|ings">evenings</reg>, <lb/>
but all are in good humour, and while some are <lb/>
thoroughly occupied with their various avocations others <lb/>
<pb n="60" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0077"/>
are engaged in free conversation, or in an attitude of <lb/>
easy lounge, looking on at the passing and repassing of <lb/>
the crowd of customers, occasionally hailing some friend <lb/>
or acquaintance as he pushes his way up to the bar, in <lb/>
tones of assured welcome.</p>
<p>Larger rooms of a similar kind in another town, and <lb/>
conducted in the same way, are also thronged from week <lb/>
to week, and have been for some years fully paying all <lb/>
regular expenses.</p>
<p>The actual management of work of this description, <lb/>
particularly in its details, should always be entrusted to <lb/>
one person. A lady who has the matter much at heart, <lb/>
has a kindly feeling for, and warm interest in, the <reg orig="work-|ing">working</reg> <lb/>
men, as well as tact and cheerfulness in dealing with <lb/>
them, would certainly be the most suitable person to fill <lb/>
this post; and even were the room under supervision of <lb/>
a committee or company, the arrangements of detail <lb/>
should be entrusted to one such person, or confusion <lb/>
must at times result from the difference of opinions so <lb/>
likely to arise, even on minor points, and, perhaps, much <lb/>
delay caused in changes which are often required owing <lb/>
to unavoidable circumstances, or to promote <hi rend="italic">variety,</hi> <lb/>
which is really essential to the well-being of any <reg orig="under-|taking">undertaking</reg> <lb/>
that consults the welfare and tastes of <hi rend="italic">many <reg orig="per-|sons">persons</reg>.</hi> <lb/>
Anything like the attempted superiority of one <lb/>
working man over the others, except he be the paid <lb/>
manager, provokes endless jealousies and discomforts. <lb/>
For this reason a working men's committee seldom <lb/>
answers. Dissatisfaction is caused in numberless little <lb/>
<pb n="61" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0078"/>
ways to those not on the committee, and often by close <lb/>
inspection a heartless and tyrannical exclusion of men <lb/>
disliked by those in power may be discovered, whereas <lb/>
often these men are the very persons who might be <lb/>
bettered by, and certainly ought to be encouraged to, a <lb/>
free use of the rooms provided."</p>
<p>As to the practical bearing of the subject, questions of <lb/>
a very <hi rend="italic">im</hi> practicable nature are often asked, such as the <lb/>
following:&mdash;</p>
<list>
<item>1. "What will it cost to start a coffee-hall?"</item>
<item>2. "Is such a scheme likely to succeed in a small <lb/>
village?"</item>
<item>3. "How can I find a good manager?"</item>
</list>
<p>These are specimens of the ordinary inquiries made on <lb/>
this topic, and can only be met as they are offered.</p>
<p>To the first the reply is apparent. The cost of such <lb/>
an undertaking entirely depends on the circumstances of <lb/>
the place, the nature of the locality, scale of prices, <lb/>
number of population, and funds forthcoming. No one <lb/>
rate of expenditure will be a specimen for universal copy.</p>
<p>To the second the answer is also self-evident. Can <lb/>
the village in question support a public-house? If so, it <lb/>
certainly ought to support a coffee-room of comfortable <lb/>
dimensions.</p>
<p>The third query is not so easy to answer, but, happily, <lb/>
it is possible. Excellent men, with earnest hearts and <lb/>
business capacity, are certainly to be found, and in no <lb/>
small number, as our large tradesmen and general <lb/>
employers can testify. It is true that tact, cheerfulness, <lb/>
<pb n="62" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0079"/>
neatness, quickness, and an untiring readiness to meet <lb/>
the wishes of customers, are qualities essential to a good <lb/>
manager. But if there be the high principle of a <hi rend="small-caps">love</hi> <lb/>
that desires to rescue his fellow men, and common sense <lb/>
enough to carry him through any other responsible post <lb/>
in life, all the other adjuncts will quickly follow.</p>
<p>"In reference to the frequent <hi rend="small-caps">failures</hi> of which we <lb/>
hear" &lpar;we still quote from Lady Hope's volume&rpar; "and <lb/>
their causes, instances may again be given, on the principle <lb/>
of the blind man's lantern carried to prevent the passing <lb/>
crowd from 'stumbling over' him! One sentence in a <lb/>
letter of such inquiries crosses my mind at this moment: <lb/>
'I am anxious to begin such an undertaking as you <reg orig="ad-|vise">advise</reg>. <lb/>
I am sure it would be for the real welfare of the <lb/>
people, and think of setting about it at once. What sort <lb/>
of <hi rend="italic">manager</hi> do you advise? I fancy having an old <lb/>
woman whom I know; she is quite lame, as she has very <lb/>
bad rheumatism. She will be thankful to get <hi rend="italic">any</hi> wages, <lb/>
as she is very poor. This will suit the state of our <lb/>
funds, which, as I think I told you, are not large. Or <lb/>
how would a poor man do who lives close by us? He <lb/>
is half-witted, but perfectly harmless. I am <hi rend="italic">sure</hi> he <lb/>
would do well.' It is needless to say that by return of <lb/>
post this lady was entreated to give up thoughts of <lb/>
establishing a coffee-stall.</p>
<p>"Again I have been asked," says Lady Hope, "to visit <lb/>
an ill-fated manager, whose physical powers had <reg orig="suc-|cumbed">succumbed</reg> <lb/>
beneath the opposing wishes and tempers of the <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">sixteen</hi> committee ladies, who were endeavouring to rule <lb/>
<pb n="63" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0080"/>
him, each in her own way, but <hi rend="italic">all</hi> with a rod of iron! The <lb/>
unfortunate man's groans on his sick bed were distressing <lb/>
to hear, and yet one could hardly help smiling at his <lb/>
melancholy ravings about his many mistresses, and his <lb/>
feverish anxieties to please each impartially. It is <reg orig="need-|less">needless</reg> <lb/>
to say he did not return to his post; but this <reg orig="ever-|augmenting">ever-augmenting</reg> <lb/>
committee of ladies naturally brought the <lb/>
coffee-house to a rapid close, when, after some months <lb/>
of interment, it as suddenly rose into satisfactory life <lb/>
beneath the auspices of one lady, and is, I believe, now <lb/>
flourishing."</p>
<p>Lady Hope writes strongly against the admission of <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">boys</hi> to coffee-halls. "Many of the coffee-house failures <lb/>
I have personally witnessed have been owing to the <lb/>
tremendous influx of <hi rend="italic">boys</hi> at the commencement of their <lb/>
history. Men and boys <hi rend="italic">will not</hi> amalgamate. They <lb/>
are as different and incohesive as oil and water. It is <lb/>
true that boys everywhere appreciate a coffee-room, but <lb/>
their rendezvous ought to be held in quite a different <lb/>
building from that frequented by the men. They must <lb/>
be kept entirely separate, not even entering the same <lb/>
door except as <hi rend="italic">customers</hi>, and an essential point in the <lb/>
well-being of the boys' coffee-room is the provision of <lb/>
regular occupation for them during the evening hours. <lb/>
Boys do not want a <hi rend="italic">place of rest</hi>, for their energies are <lb/>
always at work. When idle, they are always inclined to <lb/>
receive or communicate mischief, but when employed <lb/>
they are quite happy."</p>
<p>Lady Hope, ever working for the higher Christian <lb/>
<pb n="64" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0081"/>
life, emphatically points out the danger of shutting out <lb/>
religion from coffee-taverns. Moreover, she is anxious <lb/>
to infuse more love and welcome into these places, more <lb/>
Christian socialism, of the importance of which the <reg orig="fol-|lowing">following</reg> <lb/>
graphic anecdote will show:&mdash;</p>
<p>"It is the fault of very much of our Christian work," <lb/>
says this earnest worker in the cause of temperance and <lb/>
religion, "that we overlook the importance of genial <reg orig="kind-|ness">kindness</reg> <lb/>
and hearty friendship in dealing with the people <lb/>
individually.</p>
<p>"One evening on passing through our rooms, amidst <lb/>
the throng I noticed a shock-headed fellow, wild and <lb/>
dirty-looking. He had seemed rather startled on <reg orig="enter-|ing">entering</reg> <lb/>
the door of the coffee-room, at seeing so many people <lb/>
there, I suppose, or perhaps at the brightness and <lb/>
spaciousness of the place. He presently seated himself, <lb/>
however, and called for coffee. While drinking it, he <lb/>
looked at one of the yearly volumes of the <hi rend="italic">British <lb/>
Workman.</hi> I went up to him, and sitting down by his <lb/>
side, talked about some of the pictures, and then we got <lb/>
into a conversation, which, of course, ended in a warm <lb/>
invitation to him to receive the fulness of blessing the <lb/>
Lord Jesus was so freely willing to bestow on him. He <lb/>
was also told of one or two meetings to be held in the <lb/>
adjoining rooms during the week, and asked to come to <lb/>
them and hear the singing and reading.</p>
<p>"'Will you come?' I said, shaking hands with him at <lb/>
parting; 'I shall be so glad if you will come and see us <lb/>
again as soon as you can.'</p>
<pb n="65" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0082"/>
<p>"Some few weeks after, this interview, which being only <lb/>
one of many of a similar kind, that I should not have <lb/>
particularised it by any special thought, was brought to <lb/>
my mind by a visit that I paid at a door in a little back <lb/>
street quite casually, merely because it was my habit to <lb/>
take an afternoon now and then for miscellaneous <reg orig="visit-|ing">visiting</reg>.</p>
<p>"'Oh, come in!' said a kind, glad voice. 'Come <lb/>
and sit down, now <hi rend="italic">do!</hi> I'ave been a-wanting to see <lb/>
yer.'</p>
<p>"'I do not think I know your name,' was my reply. <lb/>
'Have I ever seen you before?' and so saying I gladly <lb/>
accepted the offered seat.</p>
<p>"'No, Miss, perhaps you never 'ave; but my 'usband <lb/>
knows yer.'</p>
<p>"'He does?'</p>
<p>"The woman answered, 'Yes, <hi rend="italic">he</hi> knows yer.'</p>
<p>"And then she told me the following story. She said, <lb/>
'I had asked him very often of a Saturday night to go <lb/>
into the town-hall coffee-room instead of to the <reg orig="public-|house">public-house</reg>. <lb/>
But I never could persuade him, and he used <lb/>
always to come home the worse for drink.' She then <lb/>
went on to say that a few Saturdays ago she had showed <lb/>
him a penny, and said, 'There, that would get you a <lb/>
cup of coffee at the town-hall, and then you could see <lb/>
the place, and come back and tell me all about it.'</p>
<p>"'Well,' she continued, 'he <hi rend="italic">was</hi> such a long time <lb/>
away, I never thought but he was at his old place again' <lb/>
&lpar;this signified the public-house of which he had been an <lb/>
<pb n="66" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0083"/>
habituate&rpar;; 'But not a bit of it! When he came home <lb/>
he said, "Wife! where's a looking-glass?"'</p>
<p>"At this recollection the woman burst out laughing, and <lb/>
said, 'I couldn't think whatever had come over him. <lb/>
And then he said, "Well, I have been to that 'ere place, <lb/>
and I never saw nothin' like it afore. And there was a <lb/>
young lady there, and she took a kind of fancy to me, I <lb/>
think. She <hi rend="italic">did</hi> speak kind, and she asked me to come <lb/>
again another night, and she should miss me if I didn't, <lb/>
and what not! And I want to see what kind of a fellow <lb/>
I am. Bring us the looking-glass, will yer?"'</p>
<p>"The woman was greatly amused at her own narration. <lb/>
However she went on, 'And when he sees it he says, <lb/>
"Well, I never!" and began a smoothin' down 'is 'air. <lb/>
The next night, lor! he <hi rend="italic">was</hi> a long time a cleaning of <lb/>
his self, and then off he went again to the coffee-room. <lb/>
He always comes now <hi rend="italic">regular</hi>,' she continued, 'And <lb/>
he do like it <hi rend="italic">very</hi> much, and so do I!' She nodded <lb/>
sagaciously, meaning that it made all the difference to <lb/>
the comfort and respectability of their home."</p>
<p>Lady Hope might well congratulate herself on this <lb/>
"brand plucked from the burning" through her <reg orig="loving-|kindness">loving-kindness</reg>. <lb/>
She adds&mdash;</p>
<p>"Had no welcoming word been said, that poor fellow <lb/>
might never have returned to us, and lost in the crowd <lb/>
of unnoticed inebriates, have continued a life of <reg orig="unmiti-|gated">unmitigated</reg> <lb/>
misery to himself, his wife, and his children, only <lb/>
to end that life in an eternity of still greater darkness."</p>
<p>In conclusion we cannot resist making another extract <lb/>
<pb n="67" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0084"/>
from Lady Hope's delightful book, wherein is shown her <lb/>
Christian heroism.</p>
<p>"Just after the dusky shades of a long winter's evening <lb/>
had set in, and I had seated myself at my writing table <lb/>
for an uninterrupted hour or two of work, a knock was <lb/>
heard at the door, and a note brought in. 'Waiting for <lb/>
an answer,' the servant said, but added, 'A gentleman's <lb/>
servant has brought it, and he would be glad if you <lb/>
would speak to him. He is riding, but he will come in <lb/>
if you will see him.'</p>
<p>"In a few minutes a smart-looking liveried coachman <lb/>
was in my little room, and was requesting an answer to <lb/>
the note already given. I read the note. It was to this <lb/>
effect:&mdash;</p>
<q><text id="d19"><body><div1 type="quotation">
<opener>
<salute>"'<hi rend="small-caps">Dear Madam</hi>,&mdash;</salute>
</opener>
<p>"'Our fellow servant being very ill, we take the liberty <lb/>
of asking you if you will call and see her. It is because <lb/>
she has been so anxious to see you ever since she was <lb/>
first taken ill, now three weeks ago, that we have written <lb/>
this note.</p>
<p>"'J. B., the bearer of the note, will explain to you more <lb/>
particularly.</p>

</div1></body></text></q>
<p>"'The fact is,' explained J. B., 'the person that wants <lb/>
to see you is very dangerously ill. She was for a long <lb/>
time much against your meetings, and tried to prevent <lb/>
us all from attending. Our mistress was always very <lb/>
angry if she found out that any of us went to your rooms <lb/>
and perhaps it would not do if you were to ask her <lb/>
<pb n="68" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0085"/>
to allow you to see Mrs. H.' &lpar;naming the housekeeper, <lb/>
who was ill&rpar;.</p>
<p>"'Would you mind coming in at the back door?' he <lb/>
inquired, after some further conversation, when I had <lb/>
expressed a willingness to see the sufferer, but a doubt as <lb/>
to the possibility of accomplishing such an undertaking <lb/>
in the face of the difficulty he had suggested.</p>
<p>"'The back door!' it <hi rend="italic">was</hi> a question indeed!</p>
<p>"'And in the evening after dark,' he continued.</p>
<p>"This was a new view of Christian duty certainly; but <lb/>
after some little hesitation which he cut short by saying <lb/>
he had already been too long talking, and must go, I <lb/>
asked my father's counsel, and he replied, 'Go, by all <lb/>
means. There is no question about it. Of course, go.'</p>
<p>"He was so decided, and there was so little time to <lb/>
lose, that I returned to answer my friend in the other <lb/>
room in the affirmative. He was delighted, and said, <lb/>
'Then to-morrow evening I will come for you with a <lb/>
lantern at seven o'clock.'</p>
<p>"The rain was falling heavily when my mysterious <lb/>
visitor, wrapped in a cloak, and lantern in hand, appeared <lb/>
at my window, for it had been arranged between us that <lb/>
I should be ready at the moment, and open the door to <lb/>
him myself. Well waterproofed and carrying umbrellas, <lb/>
we stepped forth into the darkness of the night, walked <lb/>
down a solitary road, and then my companion began to <lb/>
tell me that he had been wild and wicked once, but that <lb/>
since he had begun to hear the Scriptures read at the <lb/>
coffee-rooms and in the Sunday evening meetings, all had <lb/>
<pb n="69" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0086"/>
become changed with him; that for a long time now he <lb/>
had 'hated' his old ways, and been 'wonderful happy,' <lb/>
and got on well with his work, so that all the servants <lb/>
had noticed the change in him.</p>
<p>"'When they asked me any questions,' he said, 'I <reg orig="al-|ways">always</reg> <lb/>
told them where I found the blessing, and begged <lb/>
them to come too. But Mrs. H., she made great <lb/>
scorn of my new religion, and she forbid the others to go <lb/>
near the place that I told them of. Many a time I took <lb/>
courage and spoke to her about her soul, but she would <lb/>
not listen. But one day the family were away from <lb/>
home, and she was left in charge, when she thought she <lb/>
would go and hear for herself. It was a Sunday <reg orig="after-|noon">afternoon</reg> <lb/>
when she came, and she heard you read something <lb/>
out of the Bible that she could not forget. She was <lb/>
miserable, yet she came to the meetings again, and again, <lb/>
and by the time the family were at home again, she had <lb/>
begun to tell us all that she too had found the new <lb/>
rooms very good, and she urged the other servants and all <lb/>
her friends to seek their Saviour before it came too late.'</p>
<p>"This was the substance of the story with which J. B. <lb/>
beguiled our lantern-lit journey, while we walked through <lb/>
the rain. At last he stopped before a little side gate in <lb/>
the wall surrounding a kitchen garden.</p>
<p>"'Here we are,' he remarked in a mysterious whisper. <lb/>
'Now we must keep very quiet. Follow me, and I'll <lb/>
take you round the path straight to the back door. <lb/>
All right,' he said presently; 'I see a light; they are <lb/>
looking out for us.'</p>
<pb n="70" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0087"/>
<p>"Until this moment I had hardly realized the <reg orig="surrep-|titiousness">surreptitiousness</reg> <lb/>
of our errand; but now it was too late to draw <lb/>
back. With her finger on her lips to inculcate silence, <lb/>
the servant maid received me. She and others who now <lb/>
came forward removed my wet cloak and umbrella. One <lb/>
who had a lighted candle in her hand beckoned to me to <lb/>
follow, and soon I was upstairs in a little bedroom, <lb/>
where, opposite the door, in a cleanly draped bed, lay, <lb/>
or rather sat, propped up with pillows, an elderly woman. <lb/>
She stretched out both hands to receive me.</p>
<p>"'I am so glad you have come,' she said. 'I believe <lb/>
I am very, very ill, dangerously so, the doctor says. My <lb/>
mistresses are very kind to me, they give me everything <lb/>
they can persuade me to eat, and they come and read by <lb/>
my bedside. But,' she added, lowering her voice, 'It <lb/>
is only the newspapers that they read, about the <hi rend="italic">trials</hi> <lb/>
and that. I cannot bear to hear them. What I want is <lb/>
this, perhaps you can help me, I want to have <hi rend="italic">my sins <lb/>
forgiven.</hi> Oh, I have been such a sinner! I have been <lb/>
a good servant to my mistress, but I have neglected my <lb/>
own soul. I thought it was sufficient to go to church and <lb/>
give money to the poor. I attended well to my work, <lb/>
but <hi rend="italic">I am</hi> not saved. What shall I do to be saved? Oh, <lb/>
what shall I do to be saved?'</p>
<p>"I told her of the jailer's cry in her very words, and of <lb/>
the apostle's ready answer, and begged her to think of <lb/>
the all-sufficient death of Christ upon Calvary, telling her <lb/>
as simply as I could, that Jesus died to atone for her <lb/>
guilt, and that He rose again that she might <hi rend="small-caps">live.</hi></p>
<pb n="71" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0088"/>
<p>"While reading the verses on saving faith in John iii., <lb/>
she clasped her hands together, and said, '<hi rend="italic">That</hi> suits <lb/>
me. That is what I want.' I read the 14th to 16th <lb/>
verses again, and she said with a sort of sigh of relief, <lb/>
'Oh, what a comfort! I am so glad you came! I knew <lb/>
you could tell me what I wanted. Will you pray for me?'</p>
<p>"We prayed, and by this time I had been about ten <lb/>
minutes in the room. Now the maid who had conducted <lb/>
me upstairs entered again, and said, 'I am afraid we <lb/>
dare not ask you to stay longer.'</p>
<p>"'No,' said the housekeeper, 'I wish you could stay <lb/>
longer; but I am very grateful to you for coming. God <lb/>
bless you. I will <hi rend="italic">just trust.</hi> Good-bye.'</p>
<p>"We went downstairs, where I found all the servants <lb/>
assembled in the passage. While my cloak was being <lb/>
put on again, many kind hands were stretched out to me <lb/>
in silent thanks for the visit, and then J. B., lantern in <lb/>
hand, was once more conducting me through the kitchen <lb/>
garden.</p>
<p>"'We are very much obliged to you for coming,' he <lb/>
said, 'but we can never ask you to come again; it is too <lb/>
great a risk.'</p>
<p>"We quite agreed that such a proceeding was only <lb/>
suitable for an emergency, and at the request of a dying <lb/>
person. But I was much struck with one remark the <lb/>
coachman made. He said, 'Our mistress has no right <lb/>
to interfere between our souls and God. She has done <lb/>
that long enough, and we have yielded because it is as <lb/>
much as our place is worth to thwart her wishes.'</p>
<pb n="72" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0089"/>
<p>"Promising to keep me informed of the dying woman's <lb/>
state, he parted from me at the door of the night school, <lb/>
where I was to take a class that evening.</p>
<p>"Many times we prayed for her, and I often asked that <lb/>
I might, if possible, see her <hi rend="italic">once</hi> more. But weeks rolled <lb/>
on, and I heard that she was peaceful, though often <lb/>
wandering in mind. In a most unexpected way I found <lb/>
my prayer answered. Going into an hospital one day to <lb/>
see a patient, the nurse stopped me, saying, 'There is a <lb/>
person here who frequently asks for you. Can you speak <lb/>
to her for a moment? She cannot live many hours.'</p>
<p>"On entering the ward I immediately recognised my <lb/>
housekeeper friend. So changed! She was indeed <reg orig="cur-|tained">curtained</reg> <lb/>
with the shadow of death.</p>
<p>"'I fear she is unconscious,' the nurse said, 'but speak <lb/>
to her, she might know your voice.'</p>
<p>"Approaching the bed on which she lay, I stooped over <lb/>
her, and said, 'Jesus! do you know <hi rend="small-caps">Jesus</hi> who died for <lb/>
you? Jesus is <hi rend="italic">near</hi> you.'</p>
<p>"As I repeated that name she roused herself, her eyelids <lb/>
opened, her lips parted, and with a look of inexpressible <lb/>
earnestness, she raised both her hands, saying, '<hi rend="italic">Yes</hi>, <lb/>
<hi rend="small-caps">Yes, Jesus</hi>.'"</p>
<p>No more need be said of the faithful Christian labours <lb/>
of Lady Hope, who is never weary of doing good. She <lb/>
is still young, and her humane and earnest labours with <lb/>
the working classes have chiefly been conducted at <lb/>
Dorking, in Surrey, but her influence extends far and wide.</p>

<figure id="f8" rend="block" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0090"/>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">To</hi> cultivate habitual piety is true wisdom, and, <lb/>
although this important task may be best learned <lb/>
early in life, it is not in any season unattainable. In <lb/>
its commencement we should first endeavour to acquire, <lb/>
and at all times to maintain, such just notions of the <lb/>
nature and perfections of the Being we worship, as the <lb/>
dim sight we obtain of Him will admit of. These will <lb/>
enable us to perceive that our worship is rational, and <lb/>
calculated to advance our natures towards the Being who <lb/>
is our great centre of perfection. We shall perceive, <lb/>
that to obey His laws is not only to promote our own <lb/>
individual welfare, but also to enable us to communicate <lb/>
good to others, though in a limited degree, even as He <lb/>
imparts good to all.</p>
<p>Mary Carpenter, through her father's religious <reg orig="minis-|trations">ministrations</reg>, <lb/>
early perceived that religion can be supported <lb/>
by <hi rend="italic">reason</hi> as well as <hi rend="italic">faith.</hi> "It cannot be doubted," <lb/>
says Dr. Lant Carpenter, the father of the subject of this <lb/>
memoir, in his "Principles of Education," "that <reg orig="re-|ligious">religious</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="74" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0091"/>
<hi rend="italic">obedience</hi> is the best means of cultivating, <reg orig="sup-|porting">supporting</reg>, <lb/>
and confirming the religious <hi rend="italic">affections;</hi> that <lb/>
habitual regard to the will of God, where ideas regarding <lb/>
Him are tolerably correct, will always cherish the love of <lb/>
God where it exists, and will gradually produce it where <lb/>
before it did not exist." And "religious obedience" <lb/>
was the groundwork of the education which Mary <lb/>
Carpenter was trained in, and which was destined to <lb/>
bear so much good fruit throughout her long, laborious, <lb/>
and eminently Christian life.</p>
<p>Some minds are more prone to religious fervour than <lb/>
to that tranquil state of feeling which results from the <lb/>
habit of devotion, but to this it is not comparable; <lb/>
fervour may rouse the mind to greater occasional <reg orig="exer-|tions">exertions</reg>, <lb/>
and these, by producing good resolutions, may <lb/>
tend to lessen an attachment to the world; but this <lb/>
excitation will remit, and, during the intervals, the world <lb/>
will resume its influence over the heart. The religion, <lb/>
however &lpar;as in the case of Mary Carpenter&rpar;, which has <lb/>
taken unremitting hold of the affections will retain over <lb/>
them a constant and almost equal government. Besides <lb/>
satisfying our understanding with regard to the <reg orig="reason-|ableness">reasonableness</reg> <lb/>
of our worship, our hearts should be deeply <lb/>
impressed with a sense of its duty. If gratitude be due <lb/>
to an earthly benefactor, who bestows favour from <reg orig="osten-|tation">ostentation</reg>, <lb/>
from secret views for his own advantage or <lb/>
credit, and never, perhaps, with perfect disinterestedness; <lb/>
if ingratitude to such a benefactor be considered base <lb/>
and unworthy, the characteristic of degeneracy, what <lb/>
<pb n="75" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0092"/>
epithet can be given to ingratitude towards a Benefactor <lb/>
perfect beyond our comprehension; who, knowing our <lb/>
infirmities, our omissions, and transgressions of His laws, <lb/>
yet withholds not from us the hand of support, <reg orig="merci-|fully">mercifully</reg> <lb/>
extends it in forgiveness, and sheds upon us every <lb/>
supply our necessities demand? His mercy descends <lb/>
upon the just and the unjust.</p>
<p>One glance at the home-life of Mary Carpenter will at <lb/>
once show how she early became inoculated with the <lb/>
high Christian spirit which animated her whole life, and <lb/>
made her one of the most distinguished women of her <lb/>
day and generation. The following anecdote of her <lb/>
infantile life remarkably attracts our attention to her <reg orig="in-|nate">innate</reg> <lb/>
love of being <hi rend="italic">useful</hi>, which subsequently developed <lb/>
itself into the leading feature of her mind, and, next to <lb/>
the love of God, was the real happiness of her life.</p>
<p>Her father one day took little Mary and her sister for <lb/>
a walk, and led them into a field of new-mown hay. To <lb/>
roll in the sunshine like the little Anna was not enough <lb/>
for the elder Mary, who watched the haymakers busily <lb/>
at work. "I want to be ooseful, I want to be ooseful," <lb/>
she cried, and would not be satisfied till her father cut a <lb/>
stick from the hedge, with which she might rake together <lb/>
what her sister &lpar;Anna&rpar; had scattered, so early did she <lb/>
sound the keynote of the after time.</p>
<p>At three years old she had already begun to receive <lb/>
from her pious father that quickening of her moral and <lb/>
religious affections which made him ever afterwards the <lb/>
guide and inspirer of her life, the interpreter to her of <lb/>
<pb n="76" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0093"/>
Divine things. The first notions of religion were solemn, <lb/>
but with a simple gladness, and they found their way to <lb/>
her heart through the love and gentleness which <reg orig="sur-|rounded">surrounded</reg> <lb/>
her. To this she responded at once, <reg orig="com-|prehending">comprehending</reg> <lb/>
with ready sympathy the essence alike of <lb/>
Christian trust and sacrifice. In the summer of 1810 <lb/>
the parents and children were at the seaside, where they <lb/>
were joined by a friend, with whom the conversation one <lb/>
day turned upon the character of Jesus. Dr. Carpenter <lb/>
dwelt on it, as his manner was, with overflowing <reg orig="devo-|tion">devotion</reg>, <lb/>
and ended by saying how strange it was that he <lb/>
who felt its beauty so vividly should be so far from <lb/>
following its example. "But you are very like the good <lb/>
Jesus, indeed," said Mary, looking up from her dinner, <lb/>
on which she had appeared intent. Her father checked <lb/>
her, but when the child earnestly persisted, his friend <lb/>
asked her why she thought so. Taking heart with this <lb/>
encouragement, she related several acts of self-denial <lb/>
which she had observed in her father ending each by <lb/>
saying, "And that was very like the good Jesus," and <lb/>
finally added, "Last night papa took me a walk, and <lb/>
when we were coming back, the sea was come up under <lb/>
the rocks, and papa thought mamma would be frightened <lb/>
if we went all the way back again, so he took off his <lb/>
shoes and stockings and carried me through the sea, <lb/>
and that was very like the good Jesus." Also at the <lb/>
tender age of three she had said that "the good God <lb/>
had given her a great deal of love," and this was the <lb/>
chief happiness which bound her afterwards to the <lb/>
<pb n="77" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0094"/>
neglected, who found their friend in her. Her mother, <lb/>
indeed, predicted that she would often feel too much to <lb/>
act with energy; but she then hardly knew how strongly <lb/>
she was herself to impress upon her daughter the <lb/>
necessity of controlling excess of feeling beneath a <lb/>
resolute purpose of duty.</p>
<p>Mary Carpenter was born at Exeter on April 3rd, 1807. <lb/>
Two sisters and three brothers afterwards made up the <lb/>
home circle; but she never lost the consciousness that <lb/>
she was the eldest, and clung with a tender tenacity to <lb/>
her place in the family group as the "first-born." Her <lb/>
father, Dr. Lant Carpenter, had recently settled in <lb/>
Exeter as one of the ministers of the congregation <lb/>
worshipping in George's Meeting. His Nonconformist <lb/>
ancestry had for a century been connected with the <lb/>
ministry, and the peculiarly earnest spirit of devotion <lb/>
which marked his life and thought descended in the <lb/>
fullest measure to his daughter Mary. Her mother <lb/>
possessed a like deeply religious nature. But the spirit <lb/>
of the home life in which the child was reared was never <lb/>
that of stiff and formal piety, or of gloom and unrest; <lb/>
its earnestness was not oppressive, only healthful and <lb/>
bracing, and abundant room was given for the free play <lb/>
of every activity.</p>
<p>The removal of her father from Exeter to Bristol in <lb/>
1817, to become one of the ministers of the Lewin's <lb/>
Mead Meeting, laid the first young sorrow upon Mary <lb/>
Carpenter. The fibres of her life were too deeply rooted <lb/>
in the familiar scenes to bear transplanting without <lb/>
<pb n="78" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0095"/>
injury; and she never again felt the same perfect and <lb/>
unclouded happiness which had sprung from the freedom <lb/>
and joyousness of her first decade. Dr. Carpenter had <lb/>
a lecture room built adjoining the chapel, where familiar <lb/>
instruction was given to the young, and explanatory <lb/>
lectures on the Scriptures delivered to the more <reg orig="ad-|vanced">advanced</reg>. <lb/>
A Sunday School was also established, in <lb/>
which, ere long, Mary Carpenter was permitted to teach <lb/>
a class of boys, the management of the girls' branch of <lb/>
it afterwards devolving largely upon her.</p>
<p>It was while Dr. Carpenter was minister of Lewin's <lb/>
Mead Meeting, Bristol, and also conducted a private <lb/>
school, that James Martineau &lpar;now the Rev. James <reg orig="Mar-|tineau">Martineau</reg>, <lb/>
D.D., LL.D.&rpar; went from Norwich to become one <lb/>
of the doctor's pupils. With a felicity which his pen, <lb/>
more than all others, seems to possess in some marked <lb/>
respects, Dr. Martineau recalls, in a letter addressed to <lb/>
the nephew and biographer of Mary Carpenter, Mr. <lb/>
Estlin Carpenter, some precious memories of those long <lb/>
bygone days when he and Mary Carpenter were really <lb/>
schoolfellows under her excellent father's care, and which <lb/>
we take the liberty of extracting from "The Life and <lb/>
Work of Mary Carpenter." This letter will vividly <lb/>
bring our subject before the mind's eye of the reader, <lb/>
as well her mental as her physical character.</p>

<p>"It was in the summer of 1819 that I became a pupil <lb/>
of your grandfather's&mdash;a sallow stripling of fourteen, of <lb/>
<pb n="79" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0096"/>
shy and sensitive temperament, but superficially <reg orig="har-|dened">hardened</reg> <lb/>
by the rude discipline of a public school. Of the <lb/>
twelve pupils, nearly half were my superiors or equals in <lb/>
age, and we formed together an upper class, with studies <lb/>
distinct from the juniors. This association, however, did <lb/>
not extend to all our pursuits. While we had the same <lb/>
lessons in science, in history, in geography, and in the <lb/>
Greek Testament, a regard for our unequal proficiency <lb/>
and different distinctions threw us into smaller groups <lb/>
for classics and mathematics. At two or three points <lb/>
this round of studies brought us into contact with Mary <lb/>
Carpenter.</p>
<p>"A boy's impressions of new companions is <reg orig="neces-|sarily">necessarily</reg> <lb/>
relative to his own family experience. And I well <lb/>
remember the kind of respectful wonder with which, <lb/>
coming from free and easy ways with my sisters, I was <lb/>
inspired towards the sedate little girl of twelve, who <lb/>
looked at you so steadily, and always spoke like a book, <lb/>
so that, in talking to her, what you meant for sense <lb/>
seemed to turn into nonsense on the way. In her <reg orig="exte-|rior">exterior</reg>, <lb/>
as in her mental characteristics, she seemed to be <lb/>
no longer the child. With a somewhat columnar figure, <lb/>
and no springiness of movement, she glided quietly <lb/>
about, and was seldom seen to run, and a certain want <lb/>
of suppleness and natural grace interfered with her <reg orig="pro-|ficiency">proficiency</reg> <lb/>
in the usual feminine accomplishments with the <lb/>
needle, at the piano, and in the dance, and occasioned a <lb/>
pleasant surprise when, taking her pencil and colour-box <lb/>
in hand, she revealed the direction in which her sense of <lb/>
<pb n="80" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0097"/>
beauty could conquer difficulties and enable her really <lb/>
to excel. The early maturity which is so often reached <lb/>
by the eldest in a family was strongly marked in her <lb/>
countenance, not by any look of forwardness or careless <lb/>
ease, still less by any seeming hardness against <reg orig="sympa-|thetic">sympathetic</reg> <lb/>
impressions from others, but by a certain fixity of <lb/>
thoughtful attention, and the clear self-possession which <lb/>
arises from self-forgetfulness. There were traces upon <lb/>
that grave young face, if my memory does not mislead <lb/>
me, of an inward conflict of ascendancy between the <lb/>
anxious vigilance of a scrupulous conscience and the <lb/>
trustful reverence of a truthful heart, tender alike to the <lb/>
father on earth and the Father in heaven.</p>
<p>"In the public grammar schools sixty years ago the <lb/>
really efficient teaching was almost limited to Greek and <lb/>
Latin, with the subsidiary mythology and history, and I <lb/>
never can forget the shame I felt on discovering at <lb/>
Bristol the depths of my ignorance of the natural world <lb/>
and of modern times. Mrs. Carpenter had an <reg orig="extra-|ordinary">extraordinary</reg> <lb/>
knowledge of geography, and taught it to her <lb/>
children and the pupils with admirable fulness of both <lb/>
physical description and historical incident; and, in <reg orig="com-|parison">comparison</reg> <lb/>
particularly with Mary Carpenter, I soon found <lb/>
myself a simpleton in this field, and looked up to her as <lb/>
an oracle. She appeared to me to have the world and <lb/>
all that had happened in it at her finger's end, as if she <lb/>
had been always and everywhere in it, whilst I could <lb/>
only blunder through the counties and the kings of <lb/>
England, and could make a better map of Greece than <lb/>
<pb n="81" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0098"/>
of Great Britain. This feeling of humiliation was not <lb/>
abated by Mrs. Carpenter's willingness &lpar;doubtless with a <lb/>
view to stimulate emulation&rpar; to play upon it with <reg orig="ridi-|cule">ridicule</reg>, <lb/>
or with compassionate excuses that were very like <lb/>
contempt; but, at all events, it had its compensation in <lb/>
the sincere respect with which it filled me for the <reg orig="well-|informed">well-informed</reg> <lb/>
and unassuming girl who picked up my dropped <lb/>
answers and corrected my mistakes.</p>
<p>"It was not, I think, till the second of my Bristol <lb/>
years that Mary Carpenter joined the older pupils in <lb/>
certain special lessons. Successive courses of <reg orig="instruc-|tion">instruction</reg> <lb/>
were given on geology, on natural philosophy, and <lb/>
chemistry, with illustrative specimens, diagrams, and <lb/>
experiments. But interesting as they were to us, I recall <lb/>
nothing memorable with regard to her personal share in <lb/>
the work. Her Latin reading, which I seem to associate <lb/>
most with the Agricola of Tacitus, was marked by the <lb/>
same conscientious care which she evinced in everything, <lb/>
securing accuracy, but not escaping stiffness, unless at <lb/>
the appeal of some pathetic passage which softened more <lb/>
than the outer voice, it assumed for the moment a higher <lb/>
character, and admitted a gleam of poetic light. Of <lb/>
these exceptional touches I retain the most lively <reg orig="im-|pression">impression</reg>, <lb/>
because, through some difference of <reg orig="tempera-|ment">temperament</reg>, <lb/>
I was not in general much moved by the things <lb/>
which most satisfied her taste in literature, poetry, and <lb/>
art, so that where a real chord of sympathy was struck <lb/>
the tones have naturally vibrated long.</p>
<p>"Every Monday morning we had a Greek Testament <lb/>
<pb n="82" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0099"/>
reading with Dr. Carpenter, intended not less as a <reg orig="reli-|gious">religious</reg> <lb/>
lesson than as an exercise in the language and <lb/>
criticism of Scripture. That hour was always one of <lb/>
deep interest, and left, I am persuaded, lasting traces on <lb/>
the character of many a boy previously averse to serious <lb/>
thought. The influences of Sunday were still fresh. <lb/>
Upon the dear master they were visible in a certain <lb/>
toning down of his usual restless energy, and a serenity <lb/>
and tenderness of spirit which removed all fears and all <lb/>
reserves, and often made the lesson an exchange of <reg orig="con-|fidences">confidences</reg> <lb/>
among us all. To his daughter he was prophet <lb/>
as well as parent, and her whole mood and demeanour <lb/>
reflected his. While translating her verses with <reg orig="preci-|sion">precision</reg>, <lb/>
and prepared with answers to questions of history <lb/>
and arch&aelig;ology, she unconsciously betrayed, by voice, <lb/>
by eye, by the very mode of holding her book, that she <lb/>
treated the text as sacred, and in following its story felt a <lb/>
touch from which a divine virtue went out. The gospels <lb/>
were certainly read with critical care and faithful <reg orig="com-|parison">comparison</reg>; <lb/>
and if the hopelessness of the harmonist's <reg orig="pro-|blem">problem</reg> <lb/>
was unfelt, and the plain anachronisms of thought <lb/>
were unobserved, and its hills and valleys were levelled <lb/>
to one highway of sanctity, it was because an absorbing <lb/>
veneration for the person of Christ as supernatural filled <lb/>
the teacher's whole mind, and excluded the finer <reg orig="per-|ceptions">perceptions</reg> <lb/>
of the historical sense, and even obscured the <lb/>
perceptions of spiritual character. I expect that this <lb/>
early set of her religious affections, carried out as it <lb/>
was through her whole inner and outer life, rendered <lb/>
<pb n="83" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0100"/>
the newer lights of Biblical criticism always <reg orig="unwel-|come">unwelcome</reg> <lb/>
to Mary Carpenter, and made her glad to seek <lb/>
her reforming inspirations in purely practical <reg orig="direc-|tions">directions</reg>.</p>
<p>"Similar in its nature and influence was the Sunday <lb/>
lesson, in which also she was our companion. In this <lb/>
class, too, it was a matter of course that Mary's answers <lb/>
were exact and complete, and rendered so less by <reg orig="supe-|rior">superior</reg> <lb/>
intelligence than by deeper interest, being subsidiary <lb/>
to a picture on which her inner eye was reverently fixed. <lb/>
The remainder of the day was so distributed to leave no <lb/>
room for listless idleness, and yet to infuse into it a <lb/>
bright though serious repose; and her profound entrance <lb/>
into its spirit, manifest in a certain air of quickened yet <lb/>
calmer life, has left with me an indelible image still <lb/>
prominent among the contents of those delightful days. <lb/>
Even her figure, in listening to her father's services at <lb/>
Lewin's Mead Meeting-house, rises distinctly before me <lb/>
as I write. For, instead of having my place with the <lb/>
other pupils in the long line of the family pew, I usually <lb/>
sat with an aunt in a seat at right angles to the other, <lb/>
and with a near front view of it. And as I now range in <lb/>
thought over its series of vanished forms, not one of them <lb/>
is clearer than that intent young daughter, lost to herself <lb/>
and all around, and surrendered to the sweet pieties that <lb/>
flowed from that winning voice. And at the end of the <lb/>
day, when evening prayers and supper were over, and <lb/>
the juniors had gone to bed, and the rest of us lingered <lb/>
for a precious half-hour of serious talk, she was <reg orig="privi-|leged">privileged</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="84" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0101"/>
to sit with her arm in her father's, sometimes as a <lb/>
silent listener, at others helping us to draw from him his <lb/>
thoughts on some problems that perplexed us, or, in <lb/>
lighter moods, tempting him to tell the stories of his <lb/>
college days. From these Sunday evenings we seemed <lb/>
to go to rest with better-ordered minds and warmer <lb/>
hearts.</p>
<p>"Sometime during my two years at Bristol &lpar;I think it <lb/>
was shortly after your uncle Philip's birth&rpar;, Mary Carpenter <lb/>
was laid up with a long and painful affection of the eyes, <lb/>
requiring her to live for many weeks in a darkened room, <lb/>
and abstain from all attempt to use her sight. The illness <lb/>
involved not only privation but anxiety, for there was <lb/>
serious danger of its ending in blindness. To few <lb/>
natures could the passiveness to which she was thus <lb/>
reduced be more trying than to her. But her patience <lb/>
and sweetness of disposition remained perfect <reg orig="through-|out">throughout</reg>; <lb/>
and her ingenuity was never at fault in saving <lb/>
trouble to others by acting as general memory and <reg orig="time-|keeper">timekeeper</reg> <lb/>
with regard to all household arrangements as <lb/>
they came due. These characteristics would naturally <lb/>
go to the hearts of her parents, and appear to them in the <lb/>
brightest light. But I believe that my impression of <lb/>
them is due rather to the testimony of her medical <reg orig="atten-|dant">attendant</reg>, <lb/>
Mr. Estlin, who spoke of her spirit through this <lb/>
illness with an unwonted warmth.</p>

</div1></body></text></q>
<pb n="85" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0102"/>
<p>From an early age she had found much pleasure in <lb/>
composing verses, and this illness, and the devoted care <lb/>
of her sister Anna, she thus shortly after described:&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"Two sisters were together in a room</l>
<l>Cheerless and dark. The elder mourning sat,</l>
<l>Suffering, dejected, for no more she hailed</l>
<l>The bright return of morn; the sun's blest rays</l>
<l>To her were agony. With hanging head</l>
<l>She sat where most the gloom o'ershadowed her.</l>
<l>The other seemed the very soul of youth</l>
<l>And girlish beauty. She had left her play,</l>
<l>And, full of tenderness and sympathy,</l>
<l>Was reading to her sister. In her voice</l>
<l>Was mixed such kind solicitude and love</l>
<l>As touched the sufferer's heart; she raised her eyes</l>
<l>To snatch one painful, hasty glance, and saw</l>
<l>A countenance so lovely! On it fell</l>
<l>The only beams that stole into the room,</l>
<l>And brightened that sweet face so full of love!</l>
<l>One look sufficed; and often as she lay</l>
<l>Suffering the tedious nights, and when she mourned</l>
<l>The long and darksome day, she mused upon</l>
<l>That dear and beauteous vision; when her eyes</l>
<l>Refused their wonted office, then she saw</l>
<l>Rise in imagination that sweet form,</l>
<l>Cheering her solitude."</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>We do not quote this in proof of her poetic gifts, <lb/>
for they were greater in feeling than expression. But if <lb/>
poetry is love, then Mary Carpenter was an eminent one, <lb/>
for her whole nature was bound up in love to God and <lb/>
to mankind. The best of poetry is ever in alliance with <lb/>
real uncorrupted Christianity, and in this sense she was <lb/>
also a gifted poet, for Christianity in all its forms made <lb/>
<pb n="86" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0103"/>
up the happiness and work of her long life, and she felt <lb/>
with Lord Bacon when he wrote: "There never was <lb/>
found in any age of the world, either philosopher or <lb/>
sect, or law or discipline, which did so highly exalt the <lb/>
public good as the Christian faith." Mary Carpenter <lb/>
made religion her business, and God made it her <reg orig="blessed-|ness">blessedness</reg>.</p>
<q><lg type="group">
<l rend="indent">"Know</l>
<l>Without star or angel for their guide,</l>
<l>Who worship God shall find Him. Humble love,</l>

</lg></q>
<p>During her superintendence of her father's Sunday <lb/>
School &lpar;1831&rpar;, she often had occasion to pay visits to <lb/>
the homes of the scholars. These visits awakened her <lb/>
serious attention to the wretched condition of the poor. <lb/>
"How awful the state of public affairs," she wrote on <lb/>
New Year's day, 1831, in relation to the riots at Bristol, <lb/>
occasioned by the struggle for Reform, "in which we have <lb/>
entered this new year. I feel deeply moved that I can <lb/>
do no more towards alleviating the distress of the poor, <lb/>
but I hope that I shall be enabled to do so." Her <reg orig="de-|sire">desire</reg> <lb/>
was to found a number of Reformatory Schools for <lb/>
the reclaiming of juvenile criminals, as she believed that <lb/>
the then existing system only hardened them, instead of <lb/>
helping them to reform.</p>
<p>The report of the select committee of the House of <lb/>
Lords in 1847 gave a great impetus to the movement. <lb/>
"I have been astonished," wrote Miss Carpenter to one <lb/>
<pb n="87" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0104"/>
friend, "on studying the evidence in the Blue Book, to <lb/>
find what conclusive and powerful testimony to the <lb/>
worse than uselessness of prisons for juvenile offenders <lb/>
had been before the Lords for nearly four years without <lb/>
any change being made. A Bristol magistrate told <lb/>
me that for twenty years he had felt quite unhappy at <lb/>
going on committing these young culprits. The <reg orig="ap-|palling">appalling</reg> <lb/>
increase of juvenile depravity can <hi rend="italic">only</hi> be checked <lb/>
by real education&mdash;intellectual, moral, and religious. <lb/>
This cannot be given by the parents, and will not be <lb/>
sought by them; in mere self-defence we must give it <lb/>
them. Near intercourse with these poor outcast children <lb/>
has given me a constantly increasing faith in the <reg orig="apos-|tolic">apostolic</reg> <lb/>
precept, 'Overcome evil with good;' and instead <lb/>
of wondering at the wickedness of the poor creatures, I <lb/>
have admired and loved the strength of goodness in them <lb/>
and their resistance of evil."</p>
<p>In 1851 appeared her book on reformatory schools, <lb/>
entitled "Reformatory Schools for the Children of the <lb/>
Perishing and Dangerous Classes and for Juvenile <lb/>
Offenders." In this her first book Miss Carpenter thus <lb/>
summed up her leading principles:&mdash;</p>
<p>"First&mdash;That as a general rule all children, however <lb/>
apparently vicious and degraded, are capable of being <lb/>
made useful members of society, if placed under right <lb/>
influences and subjected to judicious control and <reg orig="train-|ing">training</reg>. <lb/>
The comparatively few exceptions that would occur <lb/>
do not invalidate the principle.</p>
<p>"Secondly&mdash;That the present system adopted towards <lb/>
<pb n="88" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0105"/>
offending children renders them almost certainly members <lb/>
for life of the criminal class, for it neither defers nor <reg orig="re-|forms">reforms</reg> <lb/>
them; while by checking the development of their <lb/>
powers and branding them with ignominy, it prevents <lb/>
them from gaining an honest livelihood.</p>
<p>"Thirdly&mdash;That good penal reformatory schools <reg orig="con-|ducted">conducted</reg> <lb/>
on Christian principles, where there is a wise union <lb/>
of kindness and restraint, have produced the desired <lb/>
effect of enabling the most degraded and corrupt to become <lb/>
useful members of society; but that such institutions cannot <lb/>
be efficiently carried on or maintained without a steady <lb/>
income, which cannot be certainly or justly raised by <reg orig="in-|dividual">individual</reg> <lb/>
effort alone, and without such legal authority as <lb/>
will impose sufficient restraint over the scholars to keep <lb/>
them under the school influence.</p>
<p>"Fourthly&mdash;That the parents being in reality the <lb/>
guilty parties, rather than the children, since juvenile <lb/>
delinquency usually originates in parental neglect, every <lb/>
parent should be chargeable for the maintenance of a <lb/>
child thrown by crime on the care of the State, as much <lb/>
as if the child were at large; and should be held <reg orig="re-|sponsible">responsible</reg> <lb/>
for the maintenance of a child in a reformatory <lb/>
school, or made in some way to suffer for the <reg orig="non-|discharge">non-discharge</reg> <lb/>
of this duty.</p>
<p>"If these four results are true ones, legislative <reg orig="enact-|ments">enactments</reg> <lb/>
will be needed to carry the spirit of them into <lb/>
operation."</p>
<p>Thus Mary Carpenter held the cardinal principle&mdash; <lb/>
that imprisonment for young delinquents is altogether a <lb/>
<pb n="89" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0106"/>
mistake. She proved in her great work that Christian <lb/>
love was a far better method of reclamation than <reg orig="punish-|ment">punishment</reg>. <lb/>
Her work was based on "a strong faith in the <lb/>
immortality of the human soul, the universal and parental <lb/>
government of God, and the equal value in His sight of <lb/>
each one of these poor perishing young children with <lb/>
the most exalted of our race."</p>
<p>Mary Carpenter arranged to hold a congress of friends <lb/>
interested in the cause. The idea was that three classes <lb/>
of schools should be established. First, Free Day <lb/>
Schools for those children who had not yet made <reg orig="them-|selves">themselves</reg> <lb/>
amenable to the law, but who by reason of vice, <lb/>
neglect, or extreme poverty of their parents, were not <lb/>
admitted into day schools; secondly, Industrial Feeding <lb/>
Schools for those who had subjected themselves to police <lb/>
interference by vagrancy, mendicancy, and petty <reg orig="in-|fringements">infringements</reg> <lb/>
of the law, attendance to be enforced by <lb/>
magistrates and paid for by the parents; thirdly, <reg orig="Correc-|tional">Correctional</reg> <lb/>
Reformatory Schools for children who had been <lb/>
convicted of felony, the magistrate being empowered <lb/>
to commit juvenile offenders to school instead of the <lb/>
prison.</p>
<p>Not content with the "development of views," she <lb/>
personally tried the experiment of a reformatory school <lb/>
at Kingswood, near Bristol. There she herself <reg orig="super-|intended">superintended</reg>, <lb/>
and many a sick boy has had special comforts <lb/>
prepared for him by the hands of Mary Carpenter. She <lb/>
took a house which had been erected by the Reverend <lb/>
John Wesley, and where his study and garden walk <lb/>
<pb n="90" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0107"/>
were still identified. Thinking that the experiment of <lb/>
teaching boys and girls together hardly worked <lb/>
well, she subsequently opened a second institution at <lb/>
Bristol for girls only. These schools, or institutions, <lb/>
soon obtained a character of their own throughout the <lb/>
country.</p>
<p>Still persevering, Miss Carpenter brought together <lb/>
another conference, and produced a fresh book on <lb/>
"Juvenile Delinquents." In this work she again <reg orig="con-|demned">condemned</reg> <lb/>
the principles of the Government prison for <lb/>
boys at Parkhurst. She reiterated her cry that the <lb/>
young criminal deserved pity as much as chastisement. <lb/>
The question did not fail to make way in the public <lb/>
mind. In 1854 the Youthful Offenders Act became <lb/>
law. The Act contained, indeed, the clause which she <lb/>
considered eminently unpleasing, that every child must <lb/>
pass fourteen days in prison before he could be <reg orig="trans-|ferred">transferred</reg> <lb/>
to a reformatory; but at the same time it fully <lb/>
authorized the establishment of such reformatories by <lb/>
voluntary managers placing them under the sanction of <lb/>
the Home Secretary. The next step was marked by the <lb/>
formation of the "Reformatory Brotherhood" at <reg orig="Hard-|wick">Hardwick</reg> <lb/>
Court, near Gloucester, which may be put down <lb/>
as the origin of the Social Science Congress.</p>
<p>But to record the whole of Mary Carpenter's humane <lb/>
and intellectual efforts to reclaim the wretched, and <reg orig="in-|fuse">infuse</reg> <lb/>
into their benighted soul the glories of Christianity, <lb/>
would fill the allotted space of our volume. It had <lb/>
always been her rooted idea that the battle against evil <lb/>
<pb n="91" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0108"/>
could not be fairly fought until the whole of her <reg orig="pro-|gramme">programme</reg> <lb/>
had been carried out. Legislation had been <lb/>
effected for reformatory schools and certificated schools, <lb/>
but not till many years had passed was the edifice <lb/>
crowned by the day feeding industrial schools, which <lb/>
was ultimately embodied in Lord Sandon's bill. He <lb/>
proposed that board schools should have the power <lb/>
of establishing day feeding industrial schools. The <lb/>
Minister of Education said that "he did not wish to <lb/>
take to himself or the Government the credit of the <lb/>
scheme. The real credit of it belonged to many <reg orig="be-|nevolent">benevolent</reg> <lb/>
people outside the House, and amongst them <lb/>
he must mention the honoured name of Miss Carpenter, <lb/>
who had tried the system under disadvantages with <lb/>
marked success."</p>
<p>Writing in 1879, Lord Norton &lpar;who succeeded Lord <lb/>
Sandon&rpar; says: "Her earnestness, devotion, and <reg orig="prac-|tical">practical</reg> <lb/>
good sense made her a leader amongst those <lb/>
who were interested and engaged in redeeming the <lb/>
debt of society to the most neglected children. I <lb/>
went to her for instruction rather than for interchange <lb/>
of thought."</p>
<p>And now for her courageous work in India. In 1864 <lb/>
the visit of two native gentlemen from Bengal aroused <lb/>
the enthusiasm that had been kindled in the mind of <lb/>
this eminent Christian woman more than thirty years <lb/>
before by the Rajah Rammohun Roy; and she resolved <lb/>
henceforward to devote herself to the elevation of the <lb/>
women of India. In 1866 she started on her first <lb/>
<pb n="92" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0109"/>
journey&mdash;not, however, before she had induced some of <lb/>
her fellow-workers to establish yet one more school&mdash;a <lb/>
Certified Industrial School for Girls. The name given <lb/>
to her in India was "the Old Mother," a name of which <lb/>
she was very proud; and truly she was, in the words of <lb/>
the Psalmist, "a joyful mother of children." From India <lb/>
&lpar;1876&rpar; she brought back two little Hindoo boys, and <lb/>
these, with a little ragged girl she adopted, brightened <lb/>
her home. After the age of sixty she had gone out to <lb/>
India four times in order to promote her humane plans <lb/>
in our greatest dependency.</p>
<p>On the 6th of June, 1876, she gave an address on the <lb/>
religious aspects of India, and on the 14th she wrote <lb/>
proposing to visit her brother, Dr. W. Carpenter, in <lb/>
London, for the furtherance of her Indian work.</p>
<p>In looking back, Miss Carpenter felt that she had <lb/>
traversed unknown paths under the leading of a light <lb/>
that had revealed only one step at a time, and on <lb/>
Christmas Day, 1876, she writes: "Marvellous are the <lb/>
ways of the heavenly Father, guiding His children with <lb/>
an unseen, imperceptible hand, while to their own <reg orig="per-|ception">perception</reg> <lb/>
they seem to be guiding themselves. If in so <lb/>
doing they were following with hearts devoted to Him <lb/>
their own best judgment, and the suggestions of the <lb/>
powers and affections which He has planted in them, all <lb/>
will redound to His glory in the advancement of the <lb/>
human race, and the coming of the kingdom of heaven <lb/>
upon earth."</p>
<p>The year 1877 opened peacefully for Mary Carpenter. <lb/>
<pb n="93" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0110"/>
She worked steadily on, but the sense of conflict was <lb/>
over. Her mind showed no trace of waning powers; <lb/>
her heart was as warm, and her will as firm as they had <lb/>
ever been. But her work here was finished. She lay <lb/>
down one night to rest, and slept; before the day dawned <lb/>
this devoted servant of God had entered into the joy of <lb/>
her Lord. Four days later, all that was mortal of Mary <lb/>
Carpenter was laid in the beautiful cemetery of Arno's <lb/>
Vale. The long procession included the boys and girls <lb/>
of the various schools who represented her long labours <lb/>
for the children of the perishing and dangerous classes, <lb/>
as well as the still tattered and shoeless children of the <lb/>
street. The little Hindoo boys were there, and thus <lb/>
the different groups bore witness to a devotion to the <lb/>
cause of humanity which knew no restrictions of creed <lb/>
or race; which rested on the deep trust that "there <lb/>
is one God and Father of all, who is above all, and <lb/>
through all, and in all"; and which sought to lift the <lb/>
least developed and even the most degraded natures to <lb/>
that new manhood, "where there is neither Greek nor <lb/>
Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, <lb/>
bond nor free, but Christ is all, and in all."</p>
<p>At the invitation of the Dean, who had long been her <lb/>
warm friend, a monument was placed in the Cathedral. <lb/>
The tablet is surmounted by a medallion profile, and <lb/>
bears the following eloquent inscription by her old friend <lb/>
and schoolfellow, Dr. Martineau, in which is embodied <lb/>
in brief the distinguished traits of this devoted Christian <lb/>
woman, who "being dead yet speaketh."</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Turn</hi> in whatsoever direction we may amongst <lb/>
Christian bodies, we must confess that we find <lb/>
members of the Society of Friends always in the <reg orig="fore-|ground">foreground</reg> <lb/>
in Christian work. Their names are associated <lb/>
with the uprooting of many national evils, and as having <lb/>
been the earnest pioneers in effecting the healthy <reg orig="pro-|gress">progress</reg> <lb/>
of the people. The Friends have always worked <lb/>
in steadfastness, and in union, when they have once <lb/>
been convinced of their path of duty. They do not <lb/>
work for the applause of men, but for higher and holier <lb/>
motives&mdash;entire obedience to the spirit of God that <lb/>
prompts and moves them.</p>
<p>Mrs. Margaret Lucas' special call has been towards <lb/>
that grand evil of intemperance which has so long reigned <lb/>
over the working classes of England, and enthralled them <lb/>
body and soul. To this lady may well be applied the <lb/>
words of Dr. Chalmers: "Live for something. Do good <lb/>
and leave behind you a monument of virtue that the <lb/>
storm of time can never destroy. Write your name in <lb/>
kindness, love, and mercy, on the hearts of thousands <lb/>
<pb n="96" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0113"/>
you come in contact with year by year; you will never be <lb/>
forgotten. No, your name, your deeds, will be as legible <lb/>
on the hearts you leave behind as the stars on the brow <lb/>
of evening. Good deeds will shine as the stars of <lb/>
heaven." She has indeed lived for something&mdash;lived <lb/>
and worked hard for the destruction of the suicidal spirit <lb/>
of intemperance.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lucas was born at Rochdale, in Lancashire, July <lb/>
14th, 1818, and is the youngest daughter of the late <lb/>
Jacob Bright, cotton-spinner, and sister of a distinguished <lb/>
brother&mdash;Right Hon. John Bright, M.P. She is a <reg orig="mem-|ber">member</reg> <lb/>
of the Society of Friends, and her religious creed is <lb/>
broadly love and charity, an everlasting lodestar, that <lb/>
beams the brighter in the heavens the darker here on <lb/>
earth grows the night around.</p>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"True religion, sprung from God above,</l>
<l rend="indent">Is like her fountain, full of charity;</l>
<l>Embracing all things with a tender love,</l>
<l rend="indent">Full of goodwill and much expectancy;</l>
<l>Full of true justice, and sure verity,</l>
<l rend="indent">In heart and voice, free, large, even infinite,</l>
<l>Not wedged in strait particularity,</l>
<l rend="indent">But grasping all in her vast, active sight,</l>
<l>Bright lamp of God! that men would joy in thy pure light!"</l>
</lg></q>
<p>The evils of intemperance occupied the mind of Mrs. <lb/>
Lucas when she was a girl, for we find as early as sixteen <lb/>
she signed the abstinence pledge; and in 1872, during <lb/>
her visit to the Social Science Congress at Plymouth, she <lb/>
was initiated into the order of Good Templars, and <lb/>
<pb n="97" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0114"/>
has proved herself an active and useful member making <lb/>
herself thoroughly acquainted with all its operations, <lb/>
and removing unfavourable impressions and prejudices <lb/>
against the Order in the upper walks of life. Amongst <lb/>
the body of Good Templars she occupies the post of <lb/>
Grand Worthy Vice-Templar, a post of honour <reg orig="analo-|gous">analogous</reg> <lb/>
to that of Vice-President of the English Grand <lb/>
Lodge, and she is also one of the patrons of the London <lb/>
Temperance Hospital, and also at the urgent request <lb/>
of the Grand Lodge executive, joined the Board of <lb/>
Management of the Good Templar and Temperance <lb/>
orphanage. Is it not a joy to find women of her social <lb/>
standing effecting so much good with her work of <reg orig="in-|fluence">influence</reg>?</p>
<p>We quote the following in reference to Mrs. Lucas, <lb/>
from the <hi rend="italic">Watchword,</hi> the official organ of the Grand <lb/>
Lodge of England;&mdash;</p>
<p>"Whilst there is no existing organization in which less <lb/>
respect is paid to that 'rank' which 'is but the guinea's <lb/>
stamp,' than in the Independent Order of Good <reg orig="Tem-|plars">Templars</reg>, <lb/>
we feel some pride in the acquisition of such a <lb/>
sister, and we feel sure that our Conservative brethren, <lb/>
no less than those who have been politically allied to the <lb/>
party of which John and Jacob Bright have been such <lb/>
distinguished ornaments, rejoice greatly with ourselves <lb/>
that the sister of these great statesmen is our sister, not <lb/>
because of her family origin, but because she has so long <lb/>
and consistently practised and advocated our principles, <lb/>
has been initiated into our Order and has taken, step by <lb/>
<pb n="98" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0115"/>
step, the degrees that have constituted her a member of <lb/>
our Grand Lodge; thus making her eligible for the high <lb/>
and responsible position she occupies amongst us&mdash;a <lb/>
position that can be filled by a sister with dignity and <lb/>
advantage, and especially so by one whose life is so <lb/>
earnestly and completely devoted to works of Christian <lb/>
charity and enlightened patriotism."</p>
<p>Besides the mission of temperance, Mrs. Lucas has <lb/>
been an ardent worker in other public directions&mdash; <lb/>
notably as the advocate of women's right to the suffrage, <lb/>
and her public addresses have always been marked by <lb/>
the culture and the modesty of a true English <reg orig="gentle-|woman">gentlewoman</reg>. <lb/>
On this subject she is at issue with her brother <lb/>
John, but her views have the warm support of her <lb/>
brother Jacob, and a large body of intelligent ladies.</p>
<p>In 1839 this lady married Samuel Lucas, and has two <lb/>
children. Mr. Lucas died in the year 1865. He was <lb/>
for many years the managing proprietor of the <hi rend="italic">Morning <lb/>
Star</hi>, and for some time past before his death he <reg orig="suf-|fered">suffered</reg> <lb/>
from a bronchial complaint, but the immediate <lb/>
cause of his death was the shock he received by the <reg orig="sud-|den">sudden</reg> <lb/>
death of his attached friend Richard Cobden.</p>
<p>He died a fortnight after the death of the distinguished <lb/>
member for Rochdale. The <hi rend="italic">Morning Star</hi> had been for <lb/>
upwards of seven years under the direction of Mr. Lucas, <lb/>
and his health was, no doubt, affected by his increasing <lb/>
attention to the responsible duties of his position. He <lb/>
had been for a long series of years closely connected <lb/>
with that political party of which Messrs Cobden and <lb/>
<pb n="99" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0116"/>
Bright were the recognised representatives. He was an <lb/>
active member of the Anti-Corn-Law League, and when <lb/>
that great struggle was brought to a victorious <reg orig="termina-|tion">termination</reg>, <lb/>
he founded the Manchester Public Schools' <reg orig="Asso-|ciation">Association</reg>, <lb/>
and devoted himself, with his accustomed ardour, <lb/>
to the cause of popular education, taking the free-school <lb/>
system of the United States and Canada as his model.</p>
<p>Although, owing, perhaps, mainly to the opposition of <lb/>
the voluntaries, this movement was not successful, it <lb/>
contributed materially to revive the public interest in <lb/>
efforts of an educational character, especially in <reg orig="Lanca-|shire">Lancashire</reg> <lb/>
and Yorkshire.</p>
<p>He was also an energetic member of the Society for <lb/>
the Repeal of the Taxes on Knowledge, and at a later <lb/>
period, of the Constitutional Defence Association, a <lb/>
public body which it will be remembered was called into <lb/>
existence by the action of the House of Lords in <reg orig="throw-|ing">throwing</reg> <lb/>
out Mr. Gladstone's Paper Duty Repeal Bill. Mr. <lb/>
Lucas' labours in connection with this question were <lb/>
untiring, and we may justly claim for him no small share <lb/>
of the honour which attaches to those by whom the <lb/>
ultimately successful result was achieved. He was, from <lb/>
the outset of the American War, a warm sympathiser with <lb/>
the Federals, and more especially with their anti-slavery <lb/>
policy, which he regarded not only as just in itself, but <lb/>
as the only basis upon which the union could be restored <lb/>
and a permanent peace established. He was one of the <lb/>
founders of the Emancipation Society&mdash;the chairman of <lb/>
its first preliminary meeting, and the first subscriber to <lb/>
<pb n="100" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0117"/>
its funds. He had been connected with many other <lb/>
movements of a political or philanthropic character, but <lb/>
always in an unostentatious way; for no man ever less <lb/>
sought notoriety or personal distinction. He was a man <lb/>
of amiable and generous character, of strong and earnest <lb/>
convictions, and a singular ability in both a literary and <lb/>
an administrative sense. He was, as before mentioned, <lb/>
a brother-in-law of Mr. John Bright. Those who were <lb/>
personally acquainted with him will not soon forget his <lb/>
winning smile, the charm of his conversation, or the <lb/>
happy manner in which he blended modesty with courage <lb/>
in the expression of his opinions. As a man, as well as <lb/>
a journalist, he has left behind him a name which will <lb/>
long be remembered with affection and reverence. He <lb/>
died in the fifty-fourth year of his age, and his remains <lb/>
were interred in Highgate Cemetery.</p>
<p>But to return to the more immediate subject of our <lb/>
biography&mdash;Mrs. Lucas. In Holy Writ, when a picture <lb/>
is presented of a virtuous woman, one of the most <lb/>
obvious facts delineated is, that her virtues blessed not <lb/>
merely herself but others. Truly this may be affirmed <lb/>
of Mrs. Lucas. "Her husband was known in the gate," <lb/>
"her children arose and called her blessed;" they were <lb/>
not only the happier, but the better for her excellence; <lb/>
it increased the estimation in which they were held; <lb/>
it was a guarantee for corresponding qualities in them. <lb/>
Such women as Mrs. Lucas are probably the very <lb/>
happiest of their sex, who dwell with wisdom, and in the <lb/>
atmosphere of doing good to others; they exert an <lb/>
<pb n="101" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0118"/>
influence like the silent, yet irresistible electric force of <lb/>
nature, felt palpitating in and through all the fair variety <lb/>
of things, as a vital essence, yet in itself latent, subtle, <lb/>
and undefined.</p>
<p>In the midst of many discouragements in the present <lb/>
day, Mrs. Lucas must have felt it a solemn <reg orig="responsi-|bility">responsibility</reg> <lb/>
to live in an age like this. The spirit of inquiry <lb/>
among us shows many social evils continuing side by <lb/>
side with our refinement and mental progress. Yet <lb/>
there is much in the fact that these evils are now known. <lb/>
It is very unpleasant to disturb a stagnant pool, but it <lb/>
must be done before it can be drained off, and the land <lb/>
restored.</p>
<p>With Christian women of Mrs. Lucas's stamp the <reg orig="self-|condemnation">self-condemnation</reg> <lb/>
of the still small voice saying "we are <lb/>
verily guilty concerning our brother," cannot be <reg orig="ap-|peased">appeased</reg> <lb/>
but by faithful working to retrieve the past and <lb/>
benefit the future. Many women, as the bright lives <lb/>
in this volume will show, have felt this necessity laid <lb/>
upon them, and have faithfully obeyed the call of duty. <lb/>
Some, by promoting the interests of education, were <lb/>
pioneers who brought about many of the wholesome <lb/>
activities and improvements of the present day. Others, <lb/>
by their wise benevolence dried the tear of sorrow, <lb/>
and, while relieving the poor and the needy, taught <lb/>
society many a lesson as to the best means of really <lb/>
bettering the condition, and, at the same time, elevating <lb/>
the character of the poor. Others following the leading <lb/>
of events, have gone to distant lands heralds of the <lb/>
<pb n="102" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0119"/>
cross, that symbol of civilization destined everywhere to <lb/>
promote glory to God in the highest, peace on earth, <lb/>
and good will to men.</p>
<p>Not a single amelioration has occurred in our social <lb/>
system the past half century, but gifted women like Mrs. <lb/>
Lucas have helped it forward; nearly forty years ago <lb/>
there were three hundred miserable neglected women <lb/>
at one time in our metropolitan prison, shut into two <lb/>
rooms that were more like dens for wild beasts than <lb/>
anything else; and, in truth, the occupants were scarcely <lb/>
human. A kindly woman heard the appalling <reg orig="state-|ment">statement</reg> <lb/>
of their sin and misery, and she went to them <lb/>
unattended, unprotected. The story has been often <lb/>
told, never without awakening a new throb of <reg orig="emo-|tion">emotion</reg>. <lb/>
She came, the good Elizabeth Fry, like a <reg orig="crea-|ture">creature</reg> <lb/>
of another sphere, to these poor lost beings, and <lb/>
their turbulent spirits calmed before her gentle look; <lb/>
their fierce hearts thrilled at her pitying words; their <lb/>
startled souls were subdued as by a spiritual presence. <lb/>
What punishment never could have effected, sympathy <lb/>
brought at once; order, hope, reform followed. <reg orig="Sena-|tors">Senators</reg>, <lb/>
magistrates, rulers of all kinds proved the power <lb/>
for good that a weak woman, but strong in the might <lb/>
of truth, possessed and beneficently wielded.</p>
<p>And as with Mrs. Fry, so with Mrs. Lucas; many <lb/>
an intemperate man and woman has been aroused to <lb/>
their fallen condition through her stirring advocacy in <lb/>
the great cause of temperance. The miserable <reg orig="drunk-|ard">drunkard</reg>, <lb/>
the most humiliating of all spectacles, whether <lb/>
<pb n="103" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0120"/>
among the rich or the poor, appeals to woman to give <lb/>
to society the benefit of her pure example, so that the <lb/>
national and domestic sin of intemperance, the prolific <lb/>
parent of so many other sins, may be overcome.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lucas is much regarded amongst the Friends for <lb/>
her useful labours, and for her devotion to "whatsoever <lb/>
things are pure, whatsoever things are honest," and <lb/>
she could exclaim with the poet:&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l rend="indent">"The Christian beam</l>
<l>Illuminates my faith, and bids me trust</l>
<l>All that may happen to the will of heaven.</l>

<l>No useful part of duty left behind."</l>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> good work Miss Weston has done amongst <lb/>
our sailors, Mrs. Daniell has done for our soldiers. <lb/>
Both these ladies have been in heart and mind, zeal and <lb/>
piety, of a kindred spirit. And it is a source of <reg orig="congratu-|lation">congratulation</reg> <lb/>
that they have carried on their Christian work in <lb/>
opposite directions, so that the good seed has been <lb/>
abundantly sown amongst two great branches of the <lb/>
country&mdash;army and navy. And never has a more <reg orig="im-|portant">important</reg> <lb/>
service been done to the state than that <reg orig="accom-|plished">accomplished</reg> <lb/>
by these two ladies, who have raised so many <lb/>
thousands of soldiers and sailors out of their debasement <lb/>
and made them worthy of the name of men.</p>
<p>Nothing was so well known, nothing so much <reg orig="de-|plored">deplored</reg>, <lb/>
as the brutalised condition of these arms of the <lb/>
country, and their regeneration by the noble work of <lb/>
these earnest women is acknowledged with a nation's <lb/>
thanks and gratitude.</p>
<p>The chief sphere of Mrs. Daniell's work has been <lb/>
amongst the soldiers at Aldershot. Twenty-five years <lb/>
<pb n="105" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0122"/>
ago this place was nothing more than a small, obscure <lb/>
village, numbering scarcely 600 inhabitants. In 1854 <lb/>
came the Crimean War, followed by the horrors of the <lb/>
Indian Mutiny, and during this period a good deal of the <lb/>
land about a mile from Aldershot was purchased by <lb/>
Government for the purpose of forming a "permanent <lb/>
camp of instruction." Acres of gorse and heather were <lb/>
soon burnt down, fir woods cleared away, and upon the <lb/>
open space rose street after street of the dreary black <lb/>
huts which formed "the camp." Then below the hill <lb/>
on which the camp stands were erected the huge blocks <lb/>
of the "permanent barracks" for cavalry, artillery, and <lb/>
infantry.</p>
<p>In a few years the population had increased from 600 <lb/>
to 7,000, and the camp numbered from 12,000 to 18,000. <lb/>
This was the place Mrs. Daniell adopted for her mission <lb/>
work, and where she was destined to leave behind her <lb/>
so much good, and undying results amongst the British <lb/>
army. Mrs. Daniell began her excellent work by <reg orig="estab-|lishing">establishing</reg> <lb/>
missionaries amongst low lodging-houses, that, for <lb/>
instance, at Rugby through which 14,000 tramps and <lb/>
vagrants annually passed. The beginning of 1861 <reg orig="wit-|nessed">witnessed</reg> <lb/>
the starting of a fifth mission at Ventnor, and <lb/>
here the agent employed was a Bible-woman. "In <reg orig="con-|nection">connection</reg> <lb/>
with the mission at Ventnor," observes Mrs. <lb/>
Daniell's daughter, in the life of her mother, "which <lb/>
some time before her death she gave up into the hands <lb/>
of a committee, we had a wonderful testimony to God's <lb/>
faithfulness and His overruling providence. My mother <lb/>
<pb n="106" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0123"/>
and I had so often longed in our work at Ventnor for a <lb/>
larger room for the mothers' meeting, a reading-room for <lb/>
the men, missionary's residence, etc.; and there was one <lb/>
particular spot upon which we had set our hearts, nearly <lb/>
opposite our old mission room, which was just in the <lb/>
very centre of all our poor people. How well I <reg orig="remem-|ber">remember</reg>, <lb/>
in our constant visits to that street, our saying to <lb/>
each other over and over again, 'Oh, if we could only <lb/>
get that piece of ground and build! That would be the <lb/>
very place for us.'</p>
<p>"Time passed on; we were absent for a year or two <lb/>
from Ventnor, but still the desire for a mission room for <lb/>
the place never left our minds. At last my mother <lb/>
heard that some funds which had been collected by a <lb/>
dear friend for the erection of a church there had, <lb/>
through some complication in his affairs, been thrown <lb/>
into Chancery. Circumstances had now rendered this <lb/>
building unnecessary, and it suggested itself to her and <lb/>
to others what a blessing it would prove if she could <lb/>
recover the money and build with it the workman's hall. <lb/>
She set to work with earnest prayer for God's blessing <lb/>
and guidance. Letters were written to all the subscribers <lb/>
whose names and addresses could be procured, and most <lb/>
signally did He crown her efforts with success. When <lb/>
the letter came from the lawyer who kindly acted for <lb/>
her saying, 'I am happy to inform you that your unique <lb/>
appeal has been complied with,' we felt, as the Psalmist <lb/>
says, 'like those who dream,' for the surprise quite <lb/>
equalled the joy. But this was not the whole of the <lb/>
<pb n="107" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0124"/>
Lord's goodness to us in the matter. On our return to <lb/>
Ventnor, we found that in the meantime 'our piece of <lb/>
ground' was just 'let for building purposes,' and two <lb/>
cottages were rapidly rising upon it. How we had <lb/>
looked and longed for that ground in days that were <lb/>
past! and now we were often quite cast down as we <lb/>
passed and repassed, feeling that we had, as it were, only <lb/>
just lost it. Only a few months later my mother heard <lb/>
from one of her co-trustees to the following effect:&mdash;</p>
<p>"'A few days ago it came to Major R.'s ears that <lb/>
the two parties who were building the cottages had fallen <lb/>
out, and wished to put them up to auction to divide the <lb/>
money. The cottages are built as if they had been <lb/>
designed for our purpose, and with a little alteration in <lb/>
the interior, will be just what could be desired, with <lb/>
rooms also for the missionary. The sale was to take <lb/>
place yesterday, and both Mr. S. and myself coincided <lb/>
with Major R. that we could do no other than try and <lb/>
be the purchasers. To me it seemed a most marked <lb/>
leading of Providence, and we met yesterday to pray for <lb/>
the guidance of God in this matter. There was great <lb/>
competition, especially from one party, but at last K., <lb/>
who had been deputed to bid by Major R., triumphed, <lb/>
and God answered our prayers. The cost was &pound;400.'"</p>
<p>It was through the establishment of the village <lb/>
missions that Mrs. Daniell was brought into contact with <lb/>
the County Towns Mission Society, through which she <lb/>
always engaged her agents; and it was the gentleman <lb/>
then acting as secretary of the society who first pressed <lb/>
<pb n="108" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0125"/>
Aldershot upon her notice, and entreated her to take it <lb/>
up and work it in the same way as her existing mission <lb/>
stations.</p>
<p>"One day," says Mrs. Daniell, "this gentleman, at <lb/>
the close of an interview respecting my village missions, <lb/>
said, 'I wish you would adopt Aldershot.' I had been <lb/>
praying for some weeks, 'Lord, what wilt Thou have me <lb/>
to do?' For each summer of the four previous years we <lb/>
had begun a new mission; but the idea of adopting <lb/>
Aldershot seemed so strange that I laughed at the <lb/>
suggestion. 'How could I go to such a place, and what <lb/>
could I do there?' An inward voice, however, said, <lb/>
'That is the work for which you have been praying.' <lb/>
Still I hesitated, but resolved to mention it to my <lb/>
daughter, who was at that time ill, but who had been <lb/>
of essential service to me in carrying on my village <lb/>
missions.</p>
<p>"I had feared that these missions had occupied too <lb/>
much of my time, and expected that my daughter would <lb/>
have made this an objection to such an addition of <lb/>
labour as the adoption of Aldershot would involve. But <lb/>
on my mentioning it to her, the reply was, 'Oh, mother <lb/>
dear, as a soldier's daughter that is just what I should <lb/>
like.' Thus the way seemed to be opening. I said, <lb/>
'Well, let us pray about it, and if the Lord clearly leads <lb/>
us to undertake it, we will do so.'"</p>
<p>In a letter to a friend she writes thus in connection <lb/>
with Aldershot:&mdash;</p>
<p>"The arguments used to induce me to take up such a <lb/>
<pb n="109" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0126"/>
notorious place as Aldershot were&mdash;First, the success <lb/>
God has granted to each of the other missions; and <lb/>
secondly, my once very close connection with a soldier's <lb/>
life. These facts had their weight with me, and I <lb/>
promised, subject to certain conditions, to undertake it, <lb/>
one of these conditions to be the general approval of <lb/>
my Christian friends, to be shown by their continued <lb/>
confidence in me as regards the means with which to <lb/>
undertake and carry on such a work."</p>
<p>In another and concluding part of this letter Mrs. <lb/>
Daniell says,&mdash;</p>
<p>"So much has been written of Aldershot, that it is <lb/>
unnecessary for me to enter into the loathsome details of <lb/>
the unblushing vice that tracks the everyday path of the <lb/>
poor soldier. A Christian officer who has been there for <lb/>
two years told a friend that nothing that was ever said <lb/>
of the abounding wickedness could go beyond the <lb/>
reality. Something therefore ought to be done over and <lb/>
above what may yet have been attempted; for it is still <lb/>
most truly 'one of Satan's strongholds.'</p>
<p>"The number of troops stationed at Aldershot is <lb/>
estimated at from 12,000 to 24,000. For this number <lb/>
Government provides four chaplains, one Presbyterian <lb/>
minister, and two Roman Catholic priests. The Soldier's <lb/>
Friend Society has four Scripture readers. Taking the <lb/>
whole of this agency, and supposing it to be of the most <lb/>
efficient kind, it is about one agent to every 2,000. But <lb/>
this is only within the camp. Outside there are above <lb/>
one hundred public-houses, some with dancing-saloons <lb/>
<pb n="110" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0127"/>
and other arrangements by which these wretched <reg orig="pan-|derers">panderers</reg> <lb/>
to vice entrap the unwary; and the moment the <lb/>
poor soldier, tired with the forced inaction of camp life, <lb/>
sets his foot beyond the lines, his case seems desperate. <lb/>
Now it is in the midst of this mass of iniquity that the <lb/>
proper mission work is needed; and if God should bless <lb/>
my efforts, I propose to locate a missionary and a <reg orig="Bible-|woman">Bible-woman</reg> <lb/>
there."</p>
<p>She persuaded a lady friend to accompany her, and <lb/>
now we have an interesting relation of her first <reg orig="appear-|ance">appearance</reg> <lb/>
at the Aldershot camp. They were invited by the <lb/>
chaplain to tea, and after that to a soldiers' <reg orig="prayer-|meeting">prayer-meeting</reg>.</p>
<p>"As we drove through the town, and observed its <lb/>
extent, my heart sank within me. What were <hi rend="italic">we</hi> among <lb/>
so many? After tea we went to the prayer-meeting. <lb/>
The soldiers had heard a rumour of the intention of a <lb/>
lady to endeavour to do something for them, and they <lb/>
now prayed the Lord to bless her efforts. At the close <lb/>
of the meeting the officers said to my friend Dr.<gap desc="long dash" reason="missing" id="g4"/>.</p>
<p>"'Do ask Mrs. Daniell to tell the men her object.'</p>
<p>"I turned round in my seat, and said, 'Well, dear <lb/>
friends, it must seem very strange for two ladies to come <lb/>
thus amongst you. I have been asked, and the Lord <lb/>
has laid it on my heart, to do something for the soldiers <lb/>
here, but we want your help, and we know that it was <lb/>
never said that a lady appealed to a <hi rend="small-caps">British</hi> soldier for <lb/>
help in vain. Will you come forward and help us? for <lb/>
we cannot do without you. <hi rend="italic">We</hi> have need of you, and <lb/>
<pb n="111" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0128"/>
the Lord hath need of you. Let me press on you the <lb/>
exhortation of St. Paul, "I beseech you therefore, by the <lb/>
mercies of God, that ye <hi rend="italic">present</hi> your bodies a living <lb/>
sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your <reg orig="reason-|able">reasonable</reg> <lb/>
service." Don't think anything has been gained <lb/>
while one soul remains unsaved in this camp. Let us <lb/>
go forth bearing the reproach of Jesus, and if scorned of <lb/>
men, reply, "If this is to be vile, I will be yet more vile, <lb/>
so that He be glorified."' In this strain I talked to <lb/>
them for twenty minutes.</p>
<p>"After I had done, all came round me, and said how <lb/>
thankfully they would help in every way they could; and <lb/>
even before a word was spoken, I saw by their <reg orig="counte-|nances">countenances</reg> <lb/>
that I had not asked their help in vain.</p>
<p>"One of the Scripture readers also came and begged <lb/>
me to take his Bible-class on Sunday, to which I replied <lb/>
that if I could do so without infringing any military <lb/>
regulations, it would give me pleasure.</p>
<p>"On Monday several friends called at the hotel where <lb/>
we were staying&mdash;the vicar, chaplain, etc.,&mdash;to whom we <lb/>
said that from our hearts we desired to work <hi rend="italic">with</hi>, and <lb/>
not against, those who were engaged in the same Master's <lb/>
service in the place, although we could not put ourselves <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">under their control.</hi></p>
<p>"On Tuesday we went out looking for lodgings. <lb/>
Mrs.<gap desc="long dash" reason="missing" id="g5"/> said we must get a place to work in; for <lb/>
the first glance at the low public-houses and <reg orig="dancing-|saloons">dancing-saloons</reg> <lb/>
told us that the great want of the place was a <lb/>
<hi rend="small-caps">public</hi>-house opened for different purposes, and <reg orig="con-|ducted">conducted</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="112" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0129"/>
on totally different principles, from those already <lb/>
abounding; a house to which both soldier and civilian <lb/>
might be invited to pass those seasons of leisure now <lb/>
spent in the pursuit of pleasures which only debased the <lb/>
mind and hardened the heart. But I dreaded the idea <lb/>
of bricks and mortar. We inquired, however, about <lb/>
some houses which were in progress of building, and <lb/>
found that none of them were for sale; but our <reg orig="in-|formant">informant</reg> <lb/>
gave us the name of a gentleman who owned <lb/>
a good deal of land, and was interested in the place."</p>
<p>This gentleman was at once seen by Mrs. Daniell and <lb/>
her lady friend, and after the former had introduced <lb/>
herself to the gentleman, she said,&mdash;</p>
<p>"We have heard that you are kindly disposed, and <lb/>
have come to ask your advice and help in procuring a <lb/>
piece of land for the erection of a mission hall," giving <lb/>
him at the same time a running description of her village <lb/>
missions, and concluding by saying that before asking <lb/>
him to interest himself in their project, he should <reg orig="under-|stand">understand</reg> <lb/>
that it would be quite distinct from any sect or <lb/>
party, and would not be placed under the control of any <lb/>
clergyman or minister, but would stand upon perfectly <lb/>
neutral and independent ground, as all her other <reg orig="mis-|sions">missions</reg> <lb/>
did. The gentleman replied,&mdash;</p>
<p>"If these are your principles, ma'am, I shall be <reg orig="de-|lighted">delighted</reg> <lb/>
to help you."</p>
<p>Mrs. Daniell then asked him if he had a piece of <lb/>
land which would be suitable, and if he would sell it to <lb/>
them at a low price, and he expressed his readiness to do <lb/>
<pb n="113" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0130"/>
so, and the evident interest which his countenance <lb/>
evinced led her to say,&mdash;</p>
<p>"Perhaps, Mr.<gap desc="long dash" reason="missing" id="g6"/>, you will <hi rend="italic">give</hi> us a piece of <lb/>
land?"</p>
<p>"Well, ma'am," he replied, "I will do so with <reg orig="plea-|sure">pleasure</reg>."</p>
<p>Mrs. Daniell was perfectly astounded, and said,&mdash;</p>
<p>"What! give us a piece of land? Do I understand <lb/>
you aright?"</p>
<p>"Yes, quite. I am sure you are working on the <lb/>
right principle, and I shall be happy to give you the <lb/>
ground. And I shall be happy to wait on you, and take <lb/>
you to see two or three plots from which to choose your <lb/>
site."</p>
<p>The following day Mr.<gap desc="long dash" reason="missing" id="g7"/> fulfilled his promise to <lb/>
show them the plots of ground which he thought <reg orig="suit-|able">suitable</reg>. <lb/>
As they came to one open space Mrs. Daniell <lb/>
asked to whom it belonged, and he replied that it <reg orig="be-|longed">belonged</reg> <lb/>
to himself, and was one of the pieces he intended <lb/>
to show them. After that they were shown another <lb/>
piece more preferable, and when he pointed it out, Mrs. <lb/>
Daniell said,&mdash;</p>
<p>"But you don't intend to give us this?"</p>
<p>"Yes, ma'am, that is at your service, if you choose <lb/>
it; but I should wish you not to decide till you have <lb/>
seen the third piece."</p>
<p>They went on farther, and again stopped, when he <lb/>
said,&mdash;</p>
<p>"This is the other piece."</p>
<pb n="114" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0131"/>
<p>Mrs. Daniell turned round with grateful surprise, and <lb/>
said,&mdash;</p>
<p>"Surely you do not intend to offer us this piece for <lb/>
our mission hall?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I do," he replied; "if this meets your wishes, <lb/>
it is yours."</p>
<p>"Thank God!" said Mrs. Daniell, taking his hand. <lb/>
"It is not given to me, but to Him; and believe me, if <lb/>
there is one gift, in that fast-oncoming day, of which <lb/>
you will never repent, it is the ground on which we are <lb/>
now standing. It is the Lord's, and, so far as human <lb/>
law can make it, shall be consecrated to His work for <lb/>
ever!"</p>
<p>We gather from her daughter's interesting and <reg orig="in-|structive">instructive</reg> <lb/>
biography of her mother, published by Hodder <lb/>
&amp; Stoughton, that Mrs. Daniell's desire was to erect a <lb/>
mission hall, on a similar plan to the workmen's hall <lb/>
at Notting Hill, with lecture room, coffee and <reg orig="smoking-|rooms">smoking-rooms</reg>, <lb/>
together with bath rooms and residence for the <lb/>
missionary staff. This idea was, with some slight <reg orig="modi-|fication">modification</reg>, <lb/>
faithfully carried out, and on February 11th, <lb/>
1863, the foundation-stone of the new building was <lb/>
laid by the Earl of Shaftesbury. After laying the stone <lb/>
his lordship said,&mdash;</p>
<p>"It is necessary to give a word of caution&mdash;not to <lb/>
those who have undertaken the charge of this <reg orig="establish-|ment">establishment</reg>, <lb/>
but to remind those standing here&mdash;in reference <lb/>
to its object, that it is for social recreation, for religious <lb/>
instruction, for the purpose of communicating to every <lb/>
<pb n="115" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0132"/>
individual that knowledge which cannot be given on a <lb/>
large scale in camp. It is to give them access to the <lb/>
fountain of faith, to put before them religious books, to <lb/>
give them access to religious services; but it is no part <lb/>
of its object whatever&mdash;and most careful will be the <reg orig="con-|ductors">conductors</reg> <lb/>
of this establishment to avoid it&mdash;to enter upon <lb/>
controversial teaching. It is sufficient that the truths of <lb/>
the gospel shall be placed before them in all free <reg orig="sin-|cerity">sincerity</reg>, <lb/>
and that every man shall have the opportunity, as <lb/>
far as can be given him, of seeking social and religious <lb/>
intercourse, and of receiving and imparting instruction."</p>
<p>Lord Shaftesbury also powerfully repelled the <reg orig="objec-|tion">objection</reg> <lb/>
that soldiers were a hopeless class, and that the <lb/>
attempt to Christianise them was merely the dream of <lb/>
pious enthusiasm. He appealed to facts, to the lives of <lb/>
Christian soldiers whose names shone so brightly in the <lb/>
pages of history, and he appealed to the examples of <lb/>
true piety which are still the ornament of the British <lb/>
army.</p>
<p>In conclusion his lordship said,&mdash;</p>
<p>"I do hope that those good and gallant men who shall <lb/>
come to this institution to share in the blessings it is <lb/>
well calculated to afford will come with a good and <lb/>
hearty spirit, determined to avail themselves of these <lb/>
signal advantages; that they will turn to good account <lb/>
the short time they may be enabled to participate in all <lb/>
these great benefits, and recognise the hand of God, <lb/>
which has touched the hearts of those good people who <lb/>
founded an institution so essential to their welfare."</p>
<pb n="116" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0133"/>
<p>It was expected that the new building would be <reg orig="com-|pleted">completed</reg> <lb/>
and opened in August, but the work did not <lb/>
proceed so rapidly as expected, so that it was not till <lb/>
October that it was finished. The opening was <reg orig="inaugu-|rated">inaugurated</reg> <lb/>
by a week of special services, commencing on <lb/>
Sunday, October 11th. To Mrs. Daniell's great joy, <lb/>
many friends from a distance came down early enough <lb/>
on Saturday, the 10th, to join in the gathering for prayer <lb/>
at eight o'clock.</p>
<p>During the inauguration week prayer-meetings were <lb/>
held every morning at eight o'clock, a meeting for <lb/>
prayer and addresses at three p.m., and again for <reg orig="ad-|dresses">addresses</reg> <lb/>
at 6.45 p.m.</p>
<p>"Sunday, the 11th," says Mrs. Daniell, "we gathered <lb/>
in the large hall at eight o'clock for prayers. The hall <lb/>
was filled to overflowing. Indeed, numbers were unable <lb/>
to enter. All through the week the attendances were <lb/>
large, soldiers forming at every meeting the majority of <lb/>
the audience."</p>
<p>The hall stands on high ground near the cavalry <lb/>
barracks. It is in the Elizabethan style of architecture, <lb/>
a pretty, low-gabled building of grey Kentish ragstone <lb/>
surmounted by sloping roofs of red and black tiles, and <lb/>
now in its older days covered with Virginia and other <lb/>
creepers. Over the porch runs the inscription, "Our <lb/>
God, we thank Thee, for all things come of Thee. and <lb/>
of Thine own have we given Thee." Passing through <lb/>
the porch, the large hall is seen straight in front. It is <lb/>
of beautiful proportions, thirty feet by seventy, <reg orig="comfort-|ably">comfortably</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="117" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0134"/>
fitted up with chairs, and the walls adorned with <lb/>
texts; a high-pitched, open roof, from some of the beams <lb/>
of which hang several flags, giving brightness and colour <lb/>
to the room. To the left of the entrance is the bar, <lb/>
where tea, coffee, cocoa, and all kinds of light <reg orig="refresh-|ment">refreshment</reg> <lb/>
can be obtained at a very cheap rate. Still farther <lb/>
to the left is the smoking-room, provided with bagatelle <lb/>
and other games, and beyond this again a dining-room. <lb/>
Returning to the entrance, we find to our right the little <lb/>
library, where the books for lending are kept, and close <lb/>
to this is a comfortable reading-room, fifteen feet <lb/>
by thirty, the walls bright with pictures, and the tables <lb/>
plentifully supplied with daily and illustrated newspapers, <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Punch, Army and Navy Gazette</hi>, periodicals and books <lb/>
of all kinds. Over the reading-room is the drawing-room <lb/>
&mdash;"the officers' room," as it was called at first, before <lb/>
the exigencies of the work demanded Mrs. Daniell's <lb/>
continual presence. The need for this room soon sprang <lb/>
out of the Bible readings she began on her first visit to <lb/>
Aldershot, when, after mess of an evening, several officers <lb/>
would seek her lodgings to talk over the proposed work. <lb/>
Such gatherings were almost always ended by her saying, <lb/>
"Shall we not have a little Bible reading and prayer <lb/>
before we separate?"</p>
<p>Passing through the large hall on the left is a staircase <lb/>
leading up to the class-room, which is used for the nightly <lb/>
Bible readings, mothers' meetings, Band of Hope, and <lb/>
other small gatherings. The institution was, by the deed <lb/>
of trust, under the direction of Mrs. Daniell during her <lb/>
<pb n="118" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0135"/>
lifetime, and after her death &lpar;as unhappily now&rpar; under <lb/>
that of the surviving trustees, or some one appointed by <lb/>
them. "Before my mother died," says her daughter, <lb/>
"she had her own name taken off the list of trustees, <lb/>
and mine inserted in its place."</p>
<p>It will now be seen that the building contains a <lb/>
spacious hall, class-rooms, reading and smoking-rooms, <lb/>
refreshment-bar, dining-room, kitchen, and other rooms <lb/>
for the servants and those who carry on the work. The <lb/>
hall is used for tea-parties and other social gatherings, <lb/>
Sunday evening services, etc.; the class-room for <reg orig="prayer-|meetings">prayer-meetings</reg>, <lb/>
Bible readings, mothers' meetings, Band of <lb/>
Hope meetings, temperance meetings, and the nightly <lb/>
Bible-class. The reading and smoking-rooms are open <lb/>
daily to members for refreshments, reading, games, and <lb/>
social intercourse. The refreshment-bar is open to the <lb/>
public generally &lpar;Sundays excepted&rpar; from seven in the <lb/>
morning till ten at night.</p>
<p>And so the great work began. The interest awakened <lb/>
in all parts of the kingdom was something extraordinary. <lb/>
All through the country prayers were daily ascending for <lb/>
success to the Soldiers' Home and Institute. The <reg orig="mis-|sion">mission</reg> <lb/>
was literally steeped in prayer.</p>
<p>Now the social and religious value of these <lb/>
"Homes" can hardly be estimated, and it is superfluous <lb/>
to dwell on it. The testimony of all at the time of the <lb/>
founding of the mission was to the same effect&mdash;the <lb/>
terrible temptations and snares spread for the soldier in <lb/>
the innumerable public-houses and dancing-saloons of <lb/>
<pb n="119" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0136"/>
the town, while no other counter-attraction was provided. <lb/>
Government libraries and reading-rooms were established <lb/>
afterwards, but this has not materially lessened the need <lb/>
of the institutes. Soldiers, like other people, when their <lb/>
day's work is over, enjoy having some place to go <lb/>
where they can spend their evenings away from the <lb/>
barrack-room.</p>
<p>"And when we consider the peculiarities of a soldier's <lb/>
life," says Miss Daniell, "we can well understand how <lb/>
to him, almost more than to any other class, there must <lb/>
be a special attraction in a house where he can be 'at <lb/>
home' for his evenings, meeting his comrades in social <lb/>
intercourse, and otherwise enjoying himself. Unable, as <lb/>
a rule, to make a home for himself, there is no 'ain <reg orig="fire-|side">fireside</reg>' <lb/>
to which he can resort; and for the very short <lb/>
time he is stationary in one place, he has few <reg orig="oppor-|tunities">opportunities</reg> <lb/>
of making friends. Added to this is the fact <lb/>
that, owing to class prejudices, hardly a respectable <lb/>
house will open its doors to him. All these things <lb/>
combine to make him thoroughly appreciate the social <lb/>
advantages offered to him in the Homes.</p>
<p>"From the day, soon after my mother's arrival here, <lb/>
when some of the men wrote to her, 'Others may give <lb/>
their thoughts and time and talents, but the men that <lb/>
write this letter give you their hearts'&mdash;from that time to <lb/>
the present, none have more thoroughly appreciated her <lb/>
work than those for whose sakes it was primarily begun. <lb/>
And well they might. 'Look at those dancing-halls,' said <lb/>
a godly soldier to a friend, who had gone down for the <lb/>
<pb n="120" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0137"/>
laying of the foundation-stone. 'Look at those <reg orig="dancing-|halls">dancing-halls</reg>; <lb/>
you may throw a stone over twenty of them; there <lb/>
is nothing in London to match it. We have long been <lb/>
praying for such a place as this will be.'"</p>
<p>That the same feeling was shared in by the officers is <lb/>
shown by the following extract from the letter of a major <lb/>
in a cavalry regiment which was long quartered in the <lb/>
camp:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Of the benefit of the hall, as forming a retreat for <lb/>
soldiers so disposed from public-houses and canteens, <lb/>
there can exist no shade of opinion. I rejoice that I <lb/>
have got such an asylum or place of refuge for many of <lb/>
my men, apart from any religious or temperance motives. <lb/>
But of course, anxious as I am both for their spiritual <lb/>
and worldly benefit, I can with sincere gratitude return <lb/>
thanks to God, who has raised up Mrs. Daniell and such <lb/>
a noble institution."</p>
<p>It is touching to recall some of the many expressions <lb/>
of the soldiers showing their love and attachment to the <lb/>
Home, sometimes pathetic and sometimes amusing.</p>
<p>"If you will believe me, ma'am," said one of them, <lb/>
"it is like going out of hell into heaven to come up here <lb/>
from one of our rooms."</p>
<p>"You don't know what this place is to us," said <lb/>
another, "a sort of covert to run into. I used to hate <lb/>
Aldershot, and count the time till I should leave it; but <lb/>
now I dread leaving it."</p>
<p>"I wish," writes another, "we could put the hall <lb/>
upon wheels and run it up here."</p>
<pb n="121" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0138"/>
<p>"We do hope to see that dear little hall soon," wrote <lb/>
the wife of a trumpet-major, both of whom had found <lb/>
Christ here in one day; "we were greatly disappointed <lb/>
that we could not be there to the tea on the day after <lb/>
Christmas."</p>
<p>"And this," says Miss Daniell in the biography of <lb/>
her mother, "brings us to what has always and <reg orig="design-|edly">designedly</reg> <lb/>
been the prominent feature of the work&mdash;its <reg orig="spirit-|ual">spiritual</reg> <lb/>
aspect." Delightful as it was to Mrs. Daniell to see <lb/>
the men's social enjoyment and provide for it in every <lb/>
legitimate way, it was still more the joy and rejoicing of <lb/>
her heart to win their souls for Christ. Never for one <lb/>
moment did she take the tone of apology for thus <reg orig="seek-|ing">seeking</reg> <lb/>
first their spiritual interests. She never looked upon <lb/>
the men as children to be amused, but as "undying <lb/>
souls, capable of living to the height of fellowship with <lb/>
God."</p>
<p>It would be impossible to estimate the number who <lb/>
owe their conversion directly or indirectly to the <reg orig="instru-|mentality">instrumentality</reg> <lb/>
of Mrs. Daniell. The following are some <lb/>
among many instances:&mdash;</p>
<p>In July, 1864, Mrs. Daniell received a letter from a <lb/>
stranger telling her of the earnest desire of a poor old <lb/>
man that she would try and influence his son. "Oh! if <lb/>
I could only write, I would write to the lady Daniell, <lb/>
and I am sure she would look after my poor prodigal <lb/>
boy."</p>
<p>His friend promised he would write for him, and so <lb/>
the letter was despatched, telling of his sainted mother's <lb/>
<pb n="122" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0139"/>
dying prayers and the father's longing for his boy, and <lb/>
also giving some few particulars of the reckless, careless <lb/>
life which the son was leading. After reading the letter <lb/>
Mrs. Daniell sent off at once to the barracks to ask G. <lb/>
to come and see her the next afternoon, which was <lb/>
Sunday. True to his word, the young man arrived, and <lb/>
was taken up to the drawing-room. Mrs. Daniell often <lb/>
described that interview&mdash;the fine, tall, stalwart young <lb/>
fellow, in all the strength of his manhood, utterly <reg orig="care-|less">careless</reg> <lb/>
and unmoved at first, and treating everything that <lb/>
she said to him with lightness. For some time she did <lb/>
not seem to make any way with him, when suddenly <lb/>
taking up a Bible, she said,&mdash;</p>
<p>"Do you see this nice new Bible, G.? I will give it <lb/>
you for your own if you will promise me one thing."</p>
<p>His eye glistened, and he appeared softened, as he <lb/>
agreed to her request.</p>
<p>"Promise me that you will read some of it every day, <lb/>
and it shall be yours."</p>
<p>The promise was given, and so was the gift. Then <lb/>
Mrs. Daniell spoke of his father's anxiety for him, and <lb/>
reminded him of his mother.</p>
<p>"You know, G., there are all her prayers for you <lb/>
to be answered; they are indented round God's throne. <lb/>
When are you going to let the answer come?"</p>
<p>That interview ended in deep solemnity, and was the <lb/>
turning point of the young dragoon's life. He stayed <lb/>
with his comrades to the afternoon Bible-class, and from <lb/>
that day till he left Aldershot was never absent for one <lb/>
<pb n="123" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0140"/>
day from the hall except when on duty. He became as <lb/>
earnest for God as he had before been for the world. <lb/>
Some time later, letters came from him from Ireland, in <lb/>
which he said, "Oh, happy, happy day, that 16th July, <lb/>
when you sent for me to the mission hall;" and again, <lb/>
"My heart yearns for Aldershot, the place of my second <lb/>
birth."</p>
<p>Yet another instance may be given of Mrs. Daniell's <lb/>
power in mission work amongst the Aldershot soldiers, <lb/>
which we also transcribe from her daughter's affectionate <lb/>
biography:&mdash;</p>
<p>"One evening in the spring of the year which <reg orig="wit-|nessed">witnessed</reg> <lb/>
G.'s 'death unto sin and new birth unto <reg orig="righteous-|ness">righteousness</reg>,' <lb/>
I was standing outside the drawing-room, <reg orig="watch-|ing">watching</reg> <lb/>
the men as they filed out after their nightly <reg orig="Bible-|class">Bible-class</reg>. <lb/>
During my mother's address, I had noticed a <lb/>
Highlander evidently under deep impression. He was <lb/>
a manly, grave-looking man&mdash;an old soldier&mdash;with a <lb/>
thoughtful, intent Scotch face; and I felt so sure that he <lb/>
was unhappy that as he passed I put the question to <lb/>
him, 'Are you happy?'</p>
<p>"'Oh, no, far from that,' and then he told me how he <lb/>
had long been seeking, and never could find peace, and <lb/>
how restless and unsatisfied he was. It was too late that <lb/>
night for him to stay for a talk, as he came from the <lb/>
north camp, but I asked him to come down the next <lb/>
night, and Mrs. Daniell would speak to him. He was <lb/>
on duty that evening, but said he would be on pass the <lb/>
following one. I give the rest of the story in his own <lb/>
<pb n="124" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0141"/>
words, as he wrote about it to my mother some time <lb/>
afterwards:&mdash;</p>
<p>"'You prayed for me, that my heart might be opened <lb/>
to believe, and my eyes open to see all that had already <lb/>
been done. I felt the same as a condemned criminal, <lb/>
and so I was until I believed. You read several <reg orig="pas-|sages">passages</reg> <lb/>
to me, and explained them. Then you read the <lb/>
24th verse of the 5th chapter of St. John, "He that <lb/>
believeth on Me hath everlasting life." When you were <lb/>
explaining these words to me I was in an awful state <lb/>
of mind. I thought everything had been done that could <lb/>
be done now, and there was no hope; I was always <lb/>
looking into my own heart, and found no change; when <lb/>
at last, for my time was nearly up, and me not saved, I <lb/>
spoke to you about feeling the same wicked heart. You <lb/>
told me I had nothing to do with that, that it would <lb/>
always be a wicked one; and so it will, and a deceitful <lb/>
one, while this life lasts. But blessed be God, that sent <lb/>
me to Aldershot, and for sending me to meet with you <lb/>
there.&hellip; Although I have never written to you <lb/>
before, still my heart has been full of gratitude to you. <lb/>
I think upon you often. The happiest days that ever I <lb/>
spent were in Aldershot after my conversion.'"</p>
<p>Such letters as these, such manifestations of the great <lb/>
good she was doing, must have been an infinite source of <lb/>
happiness to Mrs. Daniell and her affectionate daughter.</p>
<p>"One day Mrs. Daniell received a letter from a poor <lb/>
woman begging her to try and reach her son, a wild, <lb/>
thoughtless boy, deaf to all her prayers and entreaties for <lb/>
<pb n="125" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0142"/>
him. He was invited to the hall, and after some <reg orig="con-|versation">conversation</reg>, <lb/>
in which he was besought to turn to God, he <lb/>
said,&mdash;</p>
<p>"'I wish I was like my mother. I have thought, but I <lb/>
don't think the thoughts go very deep. But, ma'am, I <lb/>
won't deceive you; I am not going to be religious yet. I <lb/>
like a soldier's life, and mean to enjoy it for some time <lb/>
longer.'</p>
<p>"'Well, if the love of Christ will not reach you, let me <lb/>
read you another word: "He that being often reproved <lb/>
hardeneth his neck, shall suddenly be destroyed, and <lb/>
that without remedy."'</p>
<p>"He still seemed unmoved, and she gave him up rather <lb/>
hopelessly, as he went off with an almost supercilious <lb/>
manner, as much as to say all that had nothing to do <lb/>
with him. But the next day he came to tell her how <lb/>
wonderfully God had wrought with him."</p>
<p>Of these typical cases of Mrs. Daniell's great success <lb/>
with the soldiers, numberless specimens could be given.</p>
<p>"One of the most remarkable features of the work <lb/>
through all these years," we gather from her biographer, <lb/>
"both here and at the Branch Homes, has been the <lb/>
continued ingathering of souls. Without any noise or <lb/>
excitement, without any special manifestation of what <lb/>
is commonly known as revival work, the blessing has <lb/>
continued year by year, month by month, week by week, <lb/>
I might almost say day by day. I believe that this is <lb/>
to be traced to the atmosphere of personal influence with <lb/>
which our many meetings are encompassed. The little <lb/>
<pb n="126" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0143"/>
'library' in each Home, from which many hundreds <lb/>
of books are yearly issued, is also in a peculiar way a <lb/>
kind of mainspring to the whole of the spiritual work. <lb/>
Every evening, from about six o'clock till the men <lb/>
leave, these little rooms are always occupied by myself <lb/>
or one of my fellow-workers, and it is there that by <lb/>
far the larger proportion of our work for souls takes <lb/>
place."</p>
<p>The year 1871 was marked in the annals of the camp <lb/>
by the largest gathering of troops ever drawn together in <lb/>
one place in England. Mrs. Daniell's energy rose to <lb/>
the occasion, and she wrote a stirring letter to the <reg orig="mem-|bers">members</reg> <lb/>
of the Home not to neglect such a golden <reg orig="oppor-|tunity">opportunity</reg> <lb/>
of sowing the gospel seed. We make the <reg orig="follow-|ing">following</reg> <lb/>
extract from this letter. Although Mrs. Daniell had <lb/>
been for some time very ill, her plan of operation to <lb/>
meet the new and large accession to the camp was <lb/>
marked with that power of mind and piety which had so <lb/>
long distinguished itself.</p>
<p>"My first suggestion," she writes, "is that as many of <lb/>
you as possible should meet together in the class-room <lb/>
at 6.30 every evening for prayer. Those whose duty <lb/>
keeps them later could drop in quietly, without <reg orig="disturb-|ing">disturbing</reg> <lb/>
the others, if the door were left open. Let your <lb/>
prayers be short, and to the point.</p>
<p>"Then, secondly, as to the means to be used. It <lb/>
would be well for you to arrange amongst yourselves for <lb/>
every new regiment and battery to be visited each day <lb/>
by two of you during the ten days or fortnight they will <lb/>
<pb n="127" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0144"/>
be in camp. Remember for how short a time you will <lb/>
have them with you, and concentrate all your energy on <lb/>
them especially. The kind friends who are taking our <lb/>
place at the hall will supply you with tracts and notices, <lb/>
and will also draw out a plan showing the order in which <lb/>
you had better visit the several regiments."</p>
<p>While Mrs. Daniell was chiefly concerned for the <lb/>
spiritual welfare of the soldier, she was deeply concerned <lb/>
about his intemperance.</p>
<p>"The means by which we seek to promote total <lb/>
abstinence at the hall," records her daughter, "&lpar;and <lb/>
when I speak of the work at the hall I include the <lb/>
Branch Homes, as they are all worked on precisely the <lb/>
same plan&rpar; are, first, by means of the refreshment-bar, <lb/>
where the soldiers and working men can get tea and <lb/>
other non-intoxicating drinks, with all kinds of <reg orig="refresh-|ment">refreshment</reg>, <lb/>
at a moderate cost; secondly, by the more direct <lb/>
efforts of the Total Abstinence Society, which was <lb/>
established soon after the opening of the hall in 1863. <lb/>
In the report for 1864 my mother said,&mdash;</p>
<p>"'The Temperance Association connected with the <lb/>
institution has 500 members. Both its president and <lb/>
vice-president are Christian officers in the camp. And <lb/>
it is a cheering fact that many of the men, after joining <lb/>
the association, pass on at once to our Bible-classes.'</p>
<p>"The working of the society has been much on the <lb/>
same basis ever since, only from the constant moves in <lb/>
camp it is liable to continual changes of the committee, <lb/>
which, as far as possible, consists of a man from each <lb/>
<pb n="128" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0145"/>
regiment in camp and one civilian member. Each has <lb/>
his own book, in which are entered the names of all <lb/>
from his regiment who sign the pledge, over whom he <lb/>
is expected to watch, by bringing them to the meetings, <lb/>
or trying to recall them to their allegiance to the society <lb/>
when they have unhappily been induced to break the <lb/>
pledge. At our weekly committee meeting, we generally <lb/>
have a sort of roll-call, with, I am afraid, very often a <lb/>
sadly long list of 'wounded' and 'missing.' The <lb/>
first Thursday in each month there is a tea-party, <lb/>
admission by sixpenny tickets. During the last five <lb/>
months the numbers at these tea-parties have varied in <lb/>
the different Homes from 150 to 430. The tea is <lb/>
followed by a lecture on the subject of Total Abstinence. <lb/>
Then we have lectures with dissolving views and lectures <lb/>
with chemical experiments. On another Thursday we <lb/>
dispense with a lecturer altogether, and the men <reg orig="them-|selves">themselves</reg> <lb/>
speak, or recite, or read, or give us part-songs, all <lb/>
bearing on the same subject. We find variety in the <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">m&eacute;nu</hi> gives the greatest chance of its being popular.</p>
<p>"Since the beginning of the year" &lpar;1864&rpar; "we have, in <lb/>
the mother Home alone, taken nearly 500 signatures. <lb/>
That the men themselves feel their drinking habits to be <lb/>
the greatest enemy in their way is abundantly proved by <lb/>
the fact of the numbers who, the moment they wish to <lb/>
be better, sign the pledge as the first step in their <lb/>
desired reformation.</p>
<p>"And now as to the result of all this temperance <lb/>
work?" asks Miss Daniell. "I think I may <reg orig="unhesi-|tatingly">unhesitatingly</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="129" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0146"/>
say, and I feel sure all my fellow-workers in this <lb/>
mission would confirm the statement, that out of the <lb/>
hundreds of men who, we trust, have been converted <lb/>
to God, almost all have first come to the Homes to sign <lb/>
the pledge. <hi rend="small-caps">It is for this reason that we value <lb/>
the Temperance Pledge</hi>."</p>

 we <lb/>
hope we have shown how much the British army owe to <lb/>
her untiring energy and religious spirit. As we have <lb/>
seen, she was a soldier's widow, and her name is <reg orig="en-|deared">endeared</reg> <lb/>

success. But "all flesh is grass," and in the month <lb/>
of September, 1871, after months of weariness and <lb/>
suffering, the servant who was always about her Master's <lb/>
business took her flight from earth. Her daughter's <lb/>
record of her departure is beautiful and consolatory:&mdash;</p>
<p>"About ten days before her death a great sense of <lb/>
unworthiness seemed resting upon her. I often heard <lb/>
her saying to herself, 'So unworthy,' 'If I am worthy,' <lb/>
'So sinful.' A friend sent her some flowers with <lb/>
Hebrews xii. 6 and Daniel xiv. 3.</p>
<p>"'Ah, what has it all been?' she said. 'I have only <lb/>

<figure id="f13" rend="block" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0148"/>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> name of Agnes Elizabeth Weston is happily <lb/>
now well known to every seaman in the Royal <lb/>
Navy; not only known, but to a vast number of them <lb/>
endeared. She was born in London, in 1840. Her <lb/>
father was a barrister, and a man of considerable <reg orig="scien-|tific">scientific</reg> <lb/>
knowledge and attainments. He was a Fellow of <lb/>
several learned societies, but withal a devoted Christian, <lb/>
and his delight was to consecrate his talents to God's <lb/>
service.</p>
<p>In speaking of her childhood's days Miss Weston has <lb/>
often said, "Woe to me, if with such a father and <lb/>
mother, and such home influences, I had been aught <lb/>
than a child of God and a worker in His vineyard." <lb/>
As a child, she had a strong will, an impulsive, <reg orig="passion-|ate">passionate</reg> <lb/>
temper, and had need of much careful training.</p>
<p>Her father was much impressed by the words of a <lb/>
professor of phrenology, who whilst staying at his house <lb/>
observed her organic development, and prophesied that <lb/>
her career would be a remarkable one; he even went <lb/>
so far as to say that a crisis would occur in her life, <lb/>
<pb n="132" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0149"/>
when she "would turn decisively either to the right or <lb/>
left, would choose to be great either in the service of <lb/>
God or in that of the world." In after years her father <lb/>
would recur to this, and say, "Agnes might have been <lb/>
an instrument for evil instead of good, but, thank God, <lb/>
it has been otherwise."</p>
<p>"Childhood and youth," says her biographer, Sophia <lb/>
G. Wintz, "passed quietly away in study and home life, <lb/>
when in 1856, at sixteen years of age, a change took <lb/>
place in circumstances immediately surrounding her <lb/>
through which the twilight dawn, and then sunshine, <lb/>
of Divine Grace was to fill her soul. Up to this time <lb/>
she had been eminently careless and dead to all spiritual <lb/>
things; unlike some who have had a glimmering of truth <lb/>
always shining in their hearts, she 'cared for none of <lb/>
these things,' and the forms of prayer, and reading of <lb/>
God's Word night and morning, gone through <reg orig="punctil-|iously">punctiliously</reg> <lb/>
by many, were utterly neglected by her.</p>
<p>"The change that took place was in the ministry of <lb/>
the church which she always attended; the Rev. James <lb/>
Fleming, B.D., now Canon of York and Vicar of St. <lb/>
Michael's, Chester Square, was appointed to the <reg orig="in-|cumbency">incumbency</reg> <lb/>
of All Saints' Chapel, Bath. His preaching <lb/>
was clear, faithful, and vigorous&mdash;Christ first, last, and <lb/>
midst; and doubtless it told upon numbers in that <reg orig="con-|gregation">congregation</reg>. <lb/>
He little thought that there was a heart in <lb/>
the breast of a young girl who attended his ministry from <lb/>
Sunday to Sunday, with whom the Lord's spirit was <lb/>
striving, and who on her part was striving against his <lb/>
<pb n="133" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0150"/>
power. In all the congregation there was hardly one <lb/>
more careless and thoughtless, and at the same time <lb/>
more determined to keep out the truth, than she was."</p>
<p>Miss Weston says herself, at this period of her life, <lb/>
"I was obliged to go to church, but I was determined not <lb/>
to listen, and oftentimes when the preacher gave out the <lb/>
text, I have stopped my ears, and shut my eyes, that I <lb/>
might neither see nor hear. I put away the truth <lb/>
deliberately from me, and the marvel is how the Good <lb/>
Shepherd followed me up."</p>
<p>But ultimately she began to listen and to think; God's <lb/>
Word was no longer a sealed book. For hours she used <lb/>
to wander about in the fields, Bible in hand, and many <lb/>
a night she laid awake in agony of soul. She sought <lb/>
peace, but seemed to find none. At times &lpar;says her <lb/>
biographer&rpar; she felt happy, tranquil, and safe; then <lb/>
again the storm burst, and all foothold seemed swept <lb/>
away.</p>
<p>"I knew that I was lost," she writes at this time; <lb/>
"but although salvation through the blood of Jesus <lb/>
Christ was clearly preached, I did not see how I could <lb/>
be saved, and, like many another, my life was a mixture <lb/>
of terror and anguish of soul, carelessness and <reg orig="amuse-|ment">amusement</reg>. <lb/>
Oh, that I had unbosomed myself to my minister, <lb/>
or to some Christian friend! but my hard, proud, <reg orig="re-|served">reserved</reg> <lb/>
spirit said, 'Anything but that,' and I paid the <lb/>
penalty by years of unrest and uselessness."</p>
<p>About this time she suddenly threw herself with all <lb/>
her irresistible energy of purpose into the study of music <lb/>
<pb n="134" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0151"/>
and organ playing. This instrument had a great <reg orig="fascina-|tion">fascination</reg> <lb/>
for her, principally from the difficulty of mastering <lb/>
it; but nothing short of this would satisfy her. After <lb/>
studying some time under the organist of the Abbey <lb/>
Church, Bath, he suggested that she should aim higher, <lb/>
and if possible place herself under the teaching of that <lb/>
celebrated organist and composer, Dr. Wesley, of <reg orig="Glou-|cester">Gloucester</reg> <lb/>
Cathedral. The Doctor was not accustomed to <lb/>
train ladies, and especially amateurs; but at the earnest <lb/>
request of his friend, Mr. Pyne, Abbey Church tutor, <lb/>
he agreed to meet Miss Weston at a certain church in <lb/>
Cheltenham, and see what she was made of.</p>
<p>Arrived at the church first, she at once made her way <lb/>
to the organ loft, and commenced playing one of Bach's <lb/>
pedal fugues. Dr. Wesley entered unobserved, and sat <lb/>
down in a pew and listened attentively; as soon as the <lb/>
fugue came to a close, he walked into the organ loft, <lb/>
and without introduction said, "I have heard enough, <lb/>
I will teach you; but do you wish to learn as an <lb/>
amateur?"</p>
<p>"No," was her answer, "I want as sharp training as <lb/>
you would give to a professional"</p>
<p>Scarcely a day now passed for some weeks that she <lb/>
was not found rousing the echoes of Gloucester <reg orig="Cathe-|dral">Cathedral</reg>, <lb/>
practising morning, noon, and till long after dark, <lb/>
spite of all the ghostly stories narrated by vergers and <lb/>
fellow-pupils.</p>
<p>In connection with this she tells the following <reg orig="in-|cident">incident</reg>. <lb/>
Dr. Wesley was one evening giving her a <lb/>
<pb n="135" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0152"/>
lesson in the Cathedral after dark; no lights were allowed <lb/>
except in the organ loft, and their feeble glimmer made <lb/>
the huge nave look black, vast, and mysterious indeed. <lb/>
She had just begun to play when a messenger arrived <lb/>
with the request that Dr. Wesley would return home at <lb/>
once on important business. He left with the promise <lb/>
to be back directly, adding as he went down the stairs, <lb/>
"I hope you will not mind my locking you in the <lb/>
Cathedral; we are not allowed to leave the doors <reg orig="un-|fastened">unfastened</reg>."</p>
<p>Despising all supernatural fears, she laughingly <reg orig="re-|joined">rejoined</reg>, <lb/>
"Oh, no, I shall be perfectly happy and <reg orig="com-|fortable">comfortable</reg> <lb/>
until your return," and at once set to work <lb/>
vigorously practising at a difficult bar of the music <reg orig="be-|fore">before</reg> <lb/>
her, not giving the ghosts or dead men's bones <lb/>
lying all around another thought.</p>
<p>Suddenly, however, she heard some muffled footsteps <lb/>
slowly and stealthily advancing up the side aisle of the <lb/>
Cathedral; they came nearer and nearer, until they <lb/>
paused in the side chapel, at the foot of the organ-loft <lb/>
stair. Feeling sure that it could not be Dr. Wesley's <lb/>
tread, she listened in dismay and horror, till, as she <lb/>
described it, "all the stories which I had heard of the <lb/>
ghost of the crusader, which was supposed to haunt the <lb/>
venerable pile, rushed into my head."</p>
<p>She sat paralysed for a moment; the next, determined <lb/>
not to give way to such childish fears, threw aside the <lb/>
curtain, and saw&mdash;no one!</p>
<p>It was only the wind whirling in and around the <lb/>
<pb n="136" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0153"/>
cloisters and the recumbent effigies in the aisle, which <lb/>
had caused sounds similar to muffled footsteps.</p>
<p>In 1868 we find Agnes Weston no longer groping in <lb/>
the dark, no longer afraid to utter truths which she had <lb/>
not realized herself, but actively engaged in unfolding to <lb/>
the young, the sick, and the dying, in Sunday-school, <lb/>
hospital and Bible-class the unsearchable riches of Christ.</p>
<p>In the early part of the year, 1868, through the kind <lb/>
interest of the chaplain, the Rev. E. J. Wight, she <lb/>
received permission to visit the patients at the Bath <lb/>
United Hospital, and it was arranged that she should <lb/>
give a short Gospel address in each of the men's wards <lb/>
once a week. On these occasions, after addressing <lb/>
them all together, she would go round from bed to bed <lb/>
and speak to each man personally, accompanying the <lb/>
words with little gifts of flowers and books.</p>
<p>Although much interested in temperance work, it is a <lb/>
remarkable fact that she did not herself become a total <lb/>
abstainer for a very considerable time. She tells the <lb/>
story of the manner in which she was induced to sign <lb/>
the pledge in the following graphic words:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I had been working in the temperance cause for <lb/>
some time, inviting others to follow a course which I <lb/>
had not entered on myself, when suddenly I was pulled <lb/>
up short in a very unlooked-for and unmistakable way. <lb/>
At the close of one of our temperance meetings, a <lb/>
desperate drunkard came up to me, wishing to sign the <lb/>
pledge. He was a chimney sweeper, and well known <lb/>
to us all. I was eager to get hold of him, knowing his <lb/>
<pb n="137" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0154"/>
past history, but as he took the pen in hand, he <reg orig="sud-|denly">suddenly</reg> <lb/>
looked up into my face, and said inquiringly,&mdash; <lb/>
'If you please, Miss Weston, be you a teetotaller?' <lb/>
Somewhat disconcerted by this direct appeal, I replied <lb/>
that 'I only took a glass of wine occasionally, of course <lb/>
in strict moderation;' upon which he laid down the pen, <lb/>
and said, 'Well, I think that I will do just as you say, <lb/>
take a glass sometimes in moderation.' No entreaties <lb/>
of mine could prevail upon him to sign the total <reg orig="ab-|stinence">abstinence</reg> <lb/>
pledge, neither could he keep within the bounds <lb/>
of moderation; he went back to his old life, saying that <lb/>
'he would do as the lady did.'</p>
<p>"That night," adds Miss Weston, "I saw my duty <lb/>
very plainly, and I enrolled my name in the pledge <lb/>
book, heartily wishing that I had done so before this <lb/>
poor fellow came forward."</p>
<p>After ten years of abstinence, during which Miss <lb/>
Weston says, to use her own words, "Although I have <lb/>
worked harder with brain, muscle, and nerve than I <lb/>
ever worked before, travelling thousands of miles, <reg orig="fre-|quently">frequently</reg> <lb/>
holding two meetings a-day, and standing at the <lb/>
helm of the large ship entrusted to my care, I may safely <lb/>
say that I have never enjoyed better health. Rest and <lb/>
food are the only doctors which I have had to employ."</p>
<p>After enrolling herself in the great temperance cause, <lb/>
we very naturally expect to see her throwing herself <lb/>
heartily into it, and such was the case. The 2nd <lb/>
Somerset Militia assembled every year at Bath for <lb/>
training, and all the evils connected with the gathering <lb/>
<pb n="138" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0155"/>
of such a body of men were very apparent. In <reg orig="con-|junction">conjunction</reg> <lb/>
with the chaplain, and with the colonel's full <lb/>
sanction and approval, coffee and reading rooms were <lb/>
started for the use of the men, and were largely <reg orig="patron-|ized">patronized</reg>. <lb/>
Every evening a popular meeting was arranged <lb/>
for them, consisting of songs, readings, and addresses, <lb/>
which were much appreciated! Miss Weston also <reg orig="un-|dertook">undertook</reg> <lb/>
a Sunday Bible-class, which was well attended, <lb/>
and the testimony of one of the officers given in the <lb/>
following words:&mdash;"Since Miss Weston has taken the <lb/>
men in hand, and kept them out of the public-houses, <lb/>
they are not like the same fellows."</p>
<p>Among her entries at this time stands the following:&mdash;</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Monday</hi>, 10<hi rend="italic">th May.</hi>&mdash;The Militia reading rooms have <lb/>
been crowded this evening with men, including many <lb/>
non-commissioned officers. I gave an address on 'An <lb/>
Awakened Conscience.' Many remained behind to our <lb/>
prayer meeting, and many signed the pledge."</p>
<p>The close of the training was commemorated by the <lb/>
colonel giving her permission to present each man with <lb/>
a Testament before they were disbanded. They were <lb/>
drawn up on the parade ground, and after a few earnest, <lb/>
simple words, she passed from rank to rank, <reg orig="accom-|panied">accompanied</reg> <lb/>
by two sergeants carrying the books, and placed <lb/>
one in each man's hands.</p>
<p>Since the devotion of her whole time to the Royal <lb/>
navy, this interesting work among the men of the 2nd <lb/>
Somerset has been taken up and developed by her sister.</p>
<p>But how did Miss Weston commence her great work <lb/>
<pb n="139" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0156"/>
among the sailors? "In the early part of 1868" she <lb/>
relates, in one of her printed statements, "I wrote a <lb/>
letter to a Christian soldier then on passage with his <lb/>
regiment from England to India in one of Her Majesty's <lb/>
troop ships. He read and re-read it, and finding <reg orig="com-|fort">comfort</reg> <lb/>
and help from its words of Christian sympathy, he <lb/>
showed it to a seaman. The seaman's eyes glistened as <lb/>
he handed back the letter, with this remark&mdash;</p>
<p>"'That is good. We poor fellows have no friend: do <lb/>
you think that that lady would write to me? I would <lb/>
give anything to receive a letter like this.'</p>
<p>"'I am sure that she will,' replied the soldier; 'I will <lb/>
write and ask her.'</p>
<p>"He did so, dating his letter from Suez. My heart <lb/>
rejoiced at finding something, ever so small, to do for <lb/>
Jesus, and I replied at once. That letter was the germ <lb/>
of all my present work in the Service."</p>
<p>"The result of Miss Weston's letter" &lpar;says Sophia <lb/>
Wintz, her biographer&rpar; "to this Christian seaman was <lb/>
a grateful and happy reply, enclosing the names of <lb/>
many sailors situated as he was, who would be glad of <lb/>
a letter also. One wrote, and another wrote, every week <lb/>
the correspondence grew larger and larger.</p>
<p>"One poor fellow, on board a ship at Rio, became a <lb/>
very frequent correspondent; his letters used to come <lb/>
by the mail with the regularity of clock-work. At last <lb/>
he wrote telling of his bitter disappointment at being <lb/>
transferred from his homeward-bound ship to one <reg orig="sta-|tioned">stationed</reg> <lb/>
in a foreign port.</p>
<pb n="140" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0157"/>
<p>"'What should I do now,' he said, 'without your <lb/>
letters? they drive away my trouble, and make Jesus <lb/>
seem so near to me. Do write to me again soon; my <lb/>
heart is almost broke at having to stay out here; but <lb/>
God's will be done. My old ship sailed out of harbour <lb/>
yesterday, homeward-bound; we all manned the rigging <lb/>
to cheer her out. I could not cheer, there was a big <lb/>
lump in my throat.'</p>
<p>"A few months passed, and a pencil note in a <reg orig="trem-|bling">trembling</reg> <lb/>
hand came from him, in which he said&mdash;</p>
<p>"'I am very ill, down with fever; but Jesus is near <lb/>
me; I know that I have everlasting life through His <lb/>
blood. Something seems to tell me that I shall have to <lb/>
wait to see my dear ones on the other side, and there I <lb/>
shall meet you too. I send you four shillings in stamps <lb/>
to help to carry on God's work among my brother <lb/>
sailors.'</p>
<p>"A letter was written in answer to this by the next mail, <lb/>
but he had entered the haven of rest, as he said to his <lb/>
mates in the hospital, 'I'm going home by a shorter cut <lb/>
than by Old England.' That letter came back with the <lb/>
one word, 'Dead,' written across it in red ink.</p>
<p>"A letter is a very precious thing to a sailor far away <lb/>
from home. Letter-writing to our sailors was certainly <lb/>
supplying a missing link, and greatly helping and <reg orig="en-|couraging">encouraging</reg> <lb/>
in their up-hill life, those who had become <lb/>
Christian men. It is well-known that Jack is generous <lb/>
and kind-hearted, easily led to the right or the wrong. <lb/>
It can therefore well be imagined how his heart is <lb/>
<pb n="141" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0158"/>
touched when he receives an unexpected letter of <reg orig="sym-|pathy">sympathy</reg> <lb/>
and encouragement from a friend in Old England, <lb/>
and that friend a Christian woman."</p>
<p>Miss Weston's correspondence with sailors grew <reg orig="im-|mensely">immensely</reg>; <lb/>
one man written to on board any ship would <lb/>
send the names of other shipmates, who wanted to be <lb/>
on the roll; some of the naval chaplains also, hearing of <lb/>
this correspondence, began to take an interest in it.</p>
<p>"We never light our pipes with your letters," wrote a <lb/>
sailor, "because you think about and cares for us."</p>
<p>Indeed, so great was the demand for written letters, <lb/>
that Miss Weston found it necessary to supplement them <lb/>
with a monthly printed letter, which enabled her to <lb/>
speak a friendly word to a very much larger number than <lb/>
she could have reached by her pen. During the first <lb/>
year of issue, 500 copies a month addressed to individual <lb/>
men were sent. In February, 1872, 1,500 copies of the <lb/>
letter were forwarded each month. The number rose <lb/>
steadily to 2,000, 2,500, 3,000 a month, and still names <lb/>
poured in from all parts of the world, and the <reg orig="circula-|tion">circulation</reg> <lb/>
rose from 3,500 to 4,000, at which figure it now <lb/>
stands.</p>
<p>These letters are called by the men "little Blue Backs," <lb/>
on account of the blue cover in which, most properly, <lb/>
they are sent into the navy. There is hardly a bronzed <lb/>
and weather-beaten blue jacket in the service who would <lb/>
not answer, if he were asked whether he knew Miss <lb/>
Weston's Blue Backs, "Why, yes, they comed aboard <lb/>
my ship every month, all the time we were away."</p>
<pb n="142" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0159"/>
<p>Her desire is to speak to each man <hi rend="italic">alone</hi>, and by the <lb/>
letter this is accomplished. Thousands of sailors read <lb/>
them because they come straight from Miss Weston's <lb/>
home, and their naval colour recommends them <reg orig="any-|where">anywhere</reg>.</p>
<p>An officer thus racily described the advent of a packet <lb/>
on the West Indian station:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I took the parcel of 'Blue Backs,' on the lower deck <lb/>
of our ship, and distributed them among the ship's <reg orig="com-|pany">company</reg>. <lb/>
It happened to be Sunday afternoon, and they <lb/>
all rushed at me with, 'Me one, sir!' and 'Me one, <lb/>
sir!' so that I had to stand against a gun, in order to <lb/>
keep off the crowd.</p>
<p>"I went round the decks again half-an-hour afterwards, <lb/>
just to see what they were doing with them; it would <lb/>
have cheered your heart to have seen the sight,&mdash;groups <lb/>
of men sitting cross-legged on the deck around one, the <lb/>
best reader probably, who was seated in the midst, <lb/>
reading the letter aloud to his listening messmates. I <lb/>
went back to my cabin to thank God for those preachers <lb/>
in blue jackets, and asked Him to bless readers and <lb/>
listeners."</p>
<p>Miss Weston's heart's desire is wellnigh accomplished. <lb/>
The whole of the navy now receives these little <reg orig="mes-|sengers">messengers</reg> <lb/>
monthly; they are sent to the Royal Naval <lb/>
hospitals at Haslar, Plymouth, and Chatham; the <reg orig="coast-|guard">coastguard</reg> <lb/>
stations have been added, and through the <reg orig="kind-|ness">kindness</reg> <lb/>
of the Trinity Board she also sends to all the <lb/>
English lighthouses.</p>
<pb n="143" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0160"/>
<p>Some lads from H.M.S. <hi rend="italic">Impregnable</hi> came to her one <lb/>
day as a deputation from the rest, with this request:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Please, ma'am, do you think that you could write us <lb/>
boys a letter all to ourselves? we don't understand the <lb/>
men's." The thought seemed a good one, and the boy's <lb/>
wish was carried into effect. In 1874, 500 copies a <lb/>
month for the boys were issued, the demand became <lb/>
great, and they rose to 2,000 copies a month, and are a <lb/>
great source of delight and interest to the lads, of whom <lb/>
there are some 2,000 at Devonport, and several <reg orig="hun-|dreds">hundreds</reg> <lb/>
at Falmouth, Portsmouth, and Portland.</p>
<p>The "Blue-Backs" are sent away month by month in <lb/>
sacksfull to the post-office, from thence to be <reg orig="distri-|buted">distributed</reg> <lb/>
all over the world to every ship in the service, <lb/>
wherever the white ensign flies. The grim monitor and <lb/>
the tiny gun-boat alike receives its gospel and <reg orig="temper-|ance">temperance</reg> <lb/>
budget regularly. They have travelled even into <lb/>
frozen regions amidst eternal snow and ice, and have <lb/>
reached the highest latitude ever attained by man.</p>
<p>Miss Weston often relates a touching incident which <lb/>
she met with at Portsmouth. She had asked permission <lb/>
of the captain, which he kindly gave, to pay a visit to <lb/>
H.M.S. <hi rend="italic">Duke of Wellington</hi>, flag-ship, and to give an <lb/>
address to the ship's company. The meeting with the <lb/>
men, which was held on the main deck, was a very <lb/>
interesting one; at its close she was asked whether she <lb/>
would visit the sick bay, to speak a word to the men who <lb/>
were not able to come to the meeting. Gladly <reg orig="assent-|ing">assenting</reg>, <lb/>
she went round, speaking a word or two to those <lb/>
<pb n="144" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0161"/>
confined to their cots. "On leaving the sick bay, I <lb/>
came," she says, "on a man who was better, and sitting <lb/>
at a table turning over the contents of his ditty box. <lb/>
The sailor's ditty box is the one little piece of property <lb/>
belonging to him in which he can keep his home <lb/>
treasures. The young seaman emptied his gradually, <lb/>
taking out photographs, dried flowers, a lock of hair, <lb/>
and some letters. As I passed him he held out a '<reg orig="Blue-|Back">Blue-Back</reg>,' <lb/>
and said to me&mdash;</p>
<p>"'Do you remember that?'</p>
<p>"'Certainly,' I answered, and taking it in my hand I <lb/>
saw by the date that it was two years old.</p>
<p>"'I got that out in China, aboard the <hi rend="italic">Rinaldo</hi>,' he <lb/>
answered, in reply to my inquiring look, 'and I thank <lb/>
God that you ever sent it to me. I was one of the <lb/>
wildest fellows in the service, but that letter showed me <lb/>
just what I was. I went to Jesus for pardon, and now <lb/>
I'm a happy man; I would not part with that letter for <lb/>
five pounds,' and he put it again in his ditty box, turning <lb/>
the key, and said slowly, 'When I die I should like it <lb/>
to be buried with me.'"</p>
<p>In the interesting book we have so largely quoted <lb/>
from,<ref target="n2" n="1">*</ref>
<note id="n2" place="foot" n="1"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>"Our Blue Jackets; a Narrative of Miss Weston's Life and <lb/>
Work Among our Sailors." Hodder &amp; Stoughton.</p></note>
 will be found samples of the letters which Miss <lb/>
Weston receives by thousands from sailors, from all parts, <lb/>
addressed to her at the Sailors' Rest, Devonport, as well <lb/>
<pb n="145" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0162"/>
as specimens of the monthly letters addressed to seamen, <lb/>
which are full of religious earnestness, and adaptability <lb/>
to the men corresponded with.</p>
<p>We will conclude the narrative of Miss Weston's work <lb/>
with an anecdote or two in the cause of temperance <lb/>
among the blue-jackets. Among her earlier efforts in <lb/>
this direction she held a meeting on board H.M.S. <hi rend="italic">St. <lb/>
Vincent</hi>, a training ship for boys, lying in Portsmouth <lb/>
harbour. "Let us picture it for a moment &lpar;says her <lb/>
biographer&rpar;. The work of the day was over; it was a <lb/>
clear, bright moonlight night; the captain had given <lb/>
permission for the meeting to be held late in the <reg orig="even-|ing">evening</reg>, <lb/>
that the muster might be general. Taking his <lb/>
stand on the poop by Miss Weston's side, he kindly <lb/>
opens the meeting with a few manly, straightforward <lb/>
words of counsel and interest; 'then,' as she <reg orig="graphi-|cally">graphically</reg> <lb/>
describes it, 'I gave them all a good talking to. <lb/>
The moon struggling through the clouds, the shadowy <lb/>
tracery of the masts and rigging, the outlines of the old <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Victory</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Duke of Wellington,</hi> the lights gleaming <lb/>
from the ports on the water, and the crowd of young <lb/>
blue-jackets below, was a scene never to be forgotten. <lb/>
There were at least five hundred upturned faces, all <lb/>
listening with eager attention to every word that was <lb/>
spoken, and coming forward in crowds at the close to <lb/>
sign the temperance pledges.'"</p>
<p>Another meeting was held on board H.M.S. <hi rend="italic"><reg orig="Van-|guard">Vanguard</reg></hi>, <lb/>
then lying in Plymouth Sound. It was a fine <lb/>
sunny day, the captain had given a cordial assent, and <lb/>
<pb n="146" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0163"/>
a kind friend had offered to take her in his own boat. <lb/>
As they neared the <hi rend="italic">Vanguard</hi>, one of the rowers <reg orig="ex-|claimed">exclaimed</reg>, <lb/>
"Hallo, she's getting up steam;" they pulled <lb/>
for their lives, determined that if possible the ship's <lb/>
company should not be baulked of "Miss Weston's <lb/>
yarn" if they could help it.</p>
<p>Coming alongside the <hi rend="italic">Vanguard</hi> her kind friend scaled <lb/>
the ship's side with her card in his hand and presented <lb/>
it to the commander, who with true British courtesy <reg orig="ex-|claimed&mdash;">exclaimed&mdash;</reg></p>
<p>"Miss Weston alongside? Tell her she shall be up in <lb/>
a moment. Out with the accommodation ladder again; <lb/>
there will yet be time for the meeting."</p>
<p>It was not long before she stood upon the deck, <lb/>
receiving smiles of welcome, and apologies for the <lb/>
apparent breach of faith; a telegram from the Admiralty, <lb/>
ordering the <hi rend="italic">Vanguard</hi> to proceed to sea, had caused all <lb/>
this commotion.</p>
<p>Now then for the meeting: "sharp" must be the <lb/>
word; where shall it be held? A place was arranged <lb/>
on the upper deck battery among the guns, and the <lb/>
boatswain's mate had orders to pipe the notice, "Miss <lb/>
Weston's come aboard to give a lecture in the upper <lb/>
deck battery." His hoarse cry and shrill whistle <reg orig="re-|sounded">resounded</reg> <lb/>
through the ship, and soon came a rush of feet <lb/>
up every companion ladder, and the crowds of eager <lb/>
faces which gathered round showed that Jack's intention <lb/>
was to see and hear everything. Some sat cross-legged <lb/>
in front, others kneeling, the remainder standing behind <lb/>
<pb n="147" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0164"/>
them, and the smaller fellows perching themselves on <lb/>
the shoulders of the standing ones.</p>
<p>A few earnest, manly words from the commander, and <lb/>
Miss Weston addressed them, not in a long set speech, <lb/>
but in a simple, natural way that they could see came <lb/>
from the heart, showing them the evils of strong drink, <lb/>
and the ruin of body and soul which it led to, and the <lb/>
blessing of having nothing to do with it. Then the <lb/>
pledge-book was placed on one of the enormous guns, <lb/>
and those willing to enrol themselves were invited to <lb/>
sign their names, looking to God for strength to keep <lb/>
their brave resolution. About forty signed the book, <lb/>
and all was over; descending into the boat, the ladder <lb/>
was again shipped, and the noble ship weighed anchor <lb/>
and stood out to sea.</p>
<p>One more incident of her temperance mission work <lb/>
among our sailors, one which Miss Weston often <reg orig="de-|scribes">describes</reg> <lb/>
to the great amusement of her hearers.</p>
<p>"I found myself one day on board H.M.S. <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italic">Topaze</hi></foreign>, of <lb/>
course by the kind permission of the commander. He <lb/>
was most interested in the proceedings, and was present <lb/>
himself; the crowd of blue-jackets were grouped before <lb/>
me on the lower deck. After addressing them, anxious <lb/>
not to lose an opportunity of taking the names of those <lb/>
who wished to enrol themselves on the <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italic">Topaze's</hi></foreign> books, <lb/>
I asked permission to do so, which was freely granted; <lb/>
but the difficulty still to be solved was the want of a <lb/>
table. I looked round, and seeing, as I supposed, a <lb/>
bread-tub with its bright polished bands standing near, <lb/>
<pb n="148" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0165"/>
I asked whether I might be allowed to use it as a <lb/>
table.</p>
<p>"'Certainly,' was the answer, with a smile; 'but it's <lb/>
the first time it has been put to such a use. Now, men, <lb/>
a couple of hands to roll out the <hi rend="italic">grog-tub!</hi>'</p>
<p>"Amidst cheers and laughter the grog-tub was rolled <lb/>
out, and a capital table it made, on which more than <lb/>
sixty enrolled their names. One young sailor came <lb/>
forward and signed his name; after doing so he laid <lb/>
down the pen, and significantly rapping the tub with <lb/>
his knuckles, said, 'There goes a nail in your coffin, <lb/>
old fellow!'</p>
<p>"After all that wished to do so had entered their <lb/>
names, the commander took up the book, and running <lb/>
his eye down the lists, significantly added, 'Sixty odd <lb/>
nails to-day; if they all hold firm I won't give much for <lb/>
the old grog-tub's life.'"</p>
<p>Miss Weston has held meetings on board very many <lb/>
ships in the service, oftentimes speaking to them on deck <lb/>
with the wind whistling through the rigging, or going <lb/>
off in the teeth of a gale of wind, caring little for the <lb/>
weather, so that she might keep her appointment and <lb/>
not disappoint her sailor friends.</p>
<p>At a recent meeting of the National Temperance <lb/>
League, in the Memorial Hall, Farringdon Street, Miss <lb/>
Weston received a richly-merited vote of thanks for her <lb/>
earnest efforts in behalf of the brave men who are <reg orig="en-|gaged">engaged</reg> <lb/>
in the defence of their country.</p>
<p>But Miss Weston's most glorious achievement among <lb/>
<pb n="149" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0166"/>
seamen has been the founding of the "Sailors' Rest and <lb/>
Institute" at Devonport, where she herself now resides <lb/>
and superintends. This great work commenced in a <lb/>
very simple manner. Whilst staying with a friend in the <lb/>
neighbourhood, her attention was drawn on the Sunday <lb/>
afternoon to the immense numbers of sailor boys on <lb/>
leave from the training ships, who were wandering <reg orig="aim-|lessly">aimlessly</reg> <lb/>
about the streets, getting into bad company and <lb/>
habits. "Somebody's boys" needed care on shore; she <lb/>
felt that many a mother was thinking of her son, and <lb/>
praying that he might be kept from evil; and most of <lb/>
these lads seemed drifting about like rudderless ships at <lb/>
the mercy of every wind and wave.</p>
<p>Anxious to get a hold on them, and to use her influence <lb/>
for God, she inquired of some officers in the service the <lb/>
best way to assemble them together. They were not <lb/>
very hopeful as to the possibility of gathering these <lb/>
young salts, and truly remarked&mdash;</p>
<p>"They are as restless when they come ashore as birds <lb/>
let out of a cage; they like to roam about, and you will <lb/>
never be able to collect them."</p>
<p>The difficulties truly seemed great; nothing daunted, <lb/>
however, Miss Weston made up her mind that she would <lb/>
not give up the young blue-jackets until a thorough trial <lb/>
of the plan had been made; and by means of notices <lb/>
distributed among the boys on board ship, she invited <lb/>
them to meet her in a large public room in Devonport <lb/>
on Sunday afternoons.</p>
<p>The first Sunday came, but, alas! after two hours' <lb/>
<pb n="150" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0167"/>
weary waiting and watching, only one lad appeared, who <lb/>
was too frightened to stay when he found that he had not <lb/>
one of his shipmates to bear him company. The <reg orig="follow-|ing">following</reg> <lb/>
Sunday not one came, although hundreds were <reg orig="roam-|ing">roaming</reg> <lb/>
about the streets. After spending four Sunday <lb/>
afternoons in this unsatisfactory manner, she was forced <lb/>
to come to the conclusion that what her naval friends <lb/>
had said was perfectly true.</p>
<p>Much discouraged, but determined not to give it up, <lb/>
she returned home, and "took it to the Lord in prayer." <lb/>
With prayer and faith came wisdom and guidance from <lb/>
above, and help from an unexpected source.</p>
<p>The friend in whose house she was staying most kindly <lb/>
offered the use of her kitchen for the meeting, with tea <lb/>
and cake as an attraction. Volunteer help also presented <lb/>
itself; two earnest Christian men, one an <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italic">employ&eacute;</hi></foreign> in <lb/>
H.M. Dockyard, the other a member of the Metropolitan <lb/>
Police, offered to go out into the streets, and if possible <lb/>
to bring the lads in. They did not work long before they <lb/>
succeeded in getting a dozen; the tea, cake, and warm <lb/>
kitchen were each in their way powerful magnets. The <lb/>
dozen doubled and trebled. Hymns were sung and <lb/>
talked over, some simple Bible story was read or told, <lb/>
prayer was offered up, and before many Sundays had <lb/>
passed, it was becoming clear that the kitchen would <lb/>
soon be too small. The lads would sit on the <reg orig="window-|ledge">window-ledge</reg>, <lb/>
among the cups and saucers on the dresser, even <lb/>
inside the grate, so crowded was the room from the <lb/>
rapidly increasing audience.</p>
<pb n="151" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0168"/>
<p>Time rolled on; the kitchen meeting swelled until it <lb/>
entirely burst its bounds, and Miss Weston was able to <lb/>
secure a room in a very good situation, close to one of <lb/>
the landing-places, and this large room was filled with <lb/>
boys every Sunday afternoon, for the meetings were <reg orig="be-|coming">becoming</reg> <lb/>
better known among them.</p>
<p>As the work widened and deepened, the question was <lb/>
constantly asked by one and another&mdash;</p>
<p>"Can't we have a place to which we can come in <lb/>
the week&mdash;a temperance house, in a word, a public-house <lb/>
without the drink, close to the dockyard?" for there <lb/>
were plenty, alas! of the other kind of public-houses up <lb/>
and down the street. The temperance men clamoured <lb/>
for a temperance head-quarters, and the Christian men <lb/>
for a religious head-quarters, and they carried the day.</p>
<p>"But for the pressure brought to bear upon me by the <lb/>
men," Miss Weston has often remarked, "I do not know <lb/>
that I ever should have started the Institute."</p>
<p>So step by step the way was cleared, and in the autumn <lb/>
of 1874 a house became vacant in Fore Street, leading <lb/>
direct to the great gateway of the Royal Dockyard. It <lb/>
was truly the very house for the purpose, scarcely a dozen <lb/>
steps from the dockyard gates.</p>
<p>But where was the silver and the gold with which to <lb/>
purchase it? "The silver and the gold are Mine, saith <lb/>
the Lord."</p>
<p>In reply to a short appeal in the columns of <hi rend="italic">The <lb/>
Christian</hi>, Miss Weston in a few days received a sufficient <lb/>
sum to pay the whole of the first year's rent, and this <lb/>
<pb n="152" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0169"/>
was sufficient indication that the fifties would grow into <lb/>
hundreds, and the hundreds into thousands, until the <lb/>
work should be accomplished.</p>
<p>Many a touching tale could be told in connection <lb/>
with the gathering together of that noble sum of nearly <lb/>
&pound;6,000 which bought and fitted up the Sailors' Rest <lb/>
and Institute. The boys in the training ships put their <lb/>
coppers together, turned them into gold, and sent them <lb/>
to Miss Weston; the men from the most distant foreign <lb/>
stations sent their savings, often with the request that <lb/>
the sum might be entered as "grog-money" &lpar;<hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> money <lb/>
given by the Admiralty in place of grog&rpar;, saved and <lb/>
devoted to the Lord's service. Officers and ships' <reg orig="com-|panies">companies</reg> <lb/>
sent handsome sums. Also from England, <reg orig="Scot-|land">Scotland</reg>, <lb/>
Ireland, America, India, New Zealand, Switzerland, <lb/>
and Italy came the needed supplies in response to the <lb/>
appeal in <hi rend="italic">The Christian</hi>, describing the need of a Sailors' <lb/>
Rest, and the way to meet it.</p>
<p>Miss Weston travelled hundreds of miles through the <lb/>
length and breadth of the land, to lay the case before <lb/>
the Christian public. Her clear, simple, true-hearted <lb/>
statement met with much hearty sympathy and response. <lb/>
Soon the dust and confusion cleared away, and through <lb/>
the goodness of God the place was finished and opened, <lb/>
not by a grand meeting, an inaugural dinner, or a flourish <lb/>
of trumpets, but by prayer and praise.</p>
<p>"This building was opened May 8th, 1876, for the <lb/>
glory of God and for the good of the Service." Such is <lb/>
an inscription on two tablets of Portland stone, in letters <lb/>
<pb n="153" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0170"/>
of gold, let in over the plate-glass windows in front of the <lb/>
"Sailors' Rest." Look at the prettily-arranged windows, <lb/>
with their tempting-looking eatables reflected in the <lb/>
bright mirrors behind, and flanked by white and gold <lb/>
china barrels with silver taps, bearing the harmless <reg orig="in-|scriptions">inscriptions</reg> <lb/>
of "New Milk," "Lemonade," "Gingerbeer," <lb/>
etc., while a brilliant little fountain sings the praises of <lb/>
cold water. Handsome lamps stand out from the <reg orig="stone-|work">stonework</reg> <lb/>
on each side of the windows, while within opal <lb/>
globes, springing from a handsome brass cable, throw <lb/>
both a soft and brilliant light on the pavement, making <lb/>
all look cheery and inviting.</p>
<p>With a light touch &lpar;continues Miss Weston's <reg orig="biogra-|pher&rpar;">biographer&rpar;</reg> <lb/>
the swing door gives way, and Miss Weston's <lb/>
public-house without the drink stands before us. The <lb/>
bar is innocent of beer and strong drink, but none the <lb/>
less cosy; two or three sailors are lounging against it, <lb/>
chatting and enjoying themselves thoroughly; the three <lb/>
brilliant copper urns, containing coffee and cocoa, are <lb/>
being constantly tapped; plenty of good things cover <lb/>
the counter, while behind the servers mirrors and <lb/>
coloured glass make up a bright background. A steam <lb/>
closet, containing besides hot joints, speaking tubes, and <lb/>
a lift communicating with the kitchen, settles and tables <lb/>
capable of accommodating fifty people, a <reg orig="beautifully-|illuminated">beautifully-illuminated</reg> <lb/>
scroll running right round the ceiling, some <lb/>
nautical pictures hanging on the walls, a parrot, and a <lb/>
musical box playing a lively tune, complete the <reg orig="refresh-|ment">refreshment</reg> <lb/>
bar, which is used by many hundreds, including <lb/>
<pb n="154" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0171"/>
sailors, soldiers, dockyards-men, sailors' wives, and <lb/>
others every day, and is a busy scene from 5.30 in the <lb/>
morning to 12 o'clock at night.</p>
<p>Leaving the bar we open a side door which leads into <lb/>
a room which is Jack's special favourite,&mdash;a small <reg orig="smok-|ing">smoking</reg> <lb/>
room. Many a yarn has been spun with an "old <lb/>
ship" over nothing stronger than a pipe and a cup of <lb/>
coffee, and many a merry tune has been played and <lb/>
hornpipe danced in the room.</p>
<p>Ascending the stairs we come to the reading-rooms, <lb/>
public and private, divided by a revolving shutter, which <lb/>
when necessary disappears into the ceiling and leaves <lb/>
one free room the entire width of the building. Some <lb/>
bookshelves, filled with books of all kinds, pictures, <reg orig="com-|fortable">comfortable</reg> <lb/>
seats, a bagatelle board, and plenty of religious <lb/>
and other papers make this room a very popular one, <lb/>
especially on Sundays, when many of the men, ashore <lb/>
from Saturday to Monday, come there for a quiet read. <lb/>
On the same floor is the bath-room, fitted with three hot <lb/>
and cold baths, and an office, from whence all the <hi rend="italic">monthly <lb/>
letters</hi> are despatched, temperance supplies sent to all <lb/>
parts of the world, and a firm hold kept on absent <lb/>
sailors.</p>
<p>Above this floor is the kitchen, large and bright with <lb/>
plenty of fresh air, and there is always a bustle here, <lb/>
cooking going on from early morning to late at night.</p>
<p>Coming down the stairs again we pass Miss Weston's <lb/>
temporary rooms, the least convenient and comfortable <lb/>
in the house, which she has fitted up and furnished <lb/>
herself.</p>
<pb n="155" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0172"/>
<p>Below these again are two rooms opening one into the <lb/>
other,&mdash;the sailors' dining and sitting rooms, one in <lb/>
which the boarders and others can have a family meal <lb/>
all together, the other a room where they can sit and <lb/>
read and write quietly, or, if they have kept the "middle <lb/>
watch," take a good sleep on the settles.</p>
<p>We descend again and come to a long passage on the <lb/>
ground floor which leads us to the dormitories, a fine <lb/>
set of buildings, one block five stories high, each of the <lb/>
beds being divided off into little private cabins much <lb/>
prized by all, especially by the Christian men, as they <lb/>
have no quiet place which they can call their own on <lb/>
board ship.</p>
<p>It is interesting to trace, by the names inside and out, <lb/>
the history of each cabin and cot. One bears the name <lb/>
of <hi rend="italic">Ruby</hi> and another of <hi rend="italic">Diamond</hi>, after Her Majesty's <lb/>
ships of these names. Another has the grand name of <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Undaunted</hi>, and another <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italic">Volage;</hi></foreign> these were given by <lb/>
the ship's companies of the respective ships and named <lb/>
by the men after them.</p>
<p>Another is called "Little Man," another "Harry," in <lb/>
memory of some dear ones gone before.</p>
<p>Another bears simply a text of Scripture; as, "My <lb/>
life is hid with Christ in God,"&mdash;given by the Duchess of <lb/>
Manchester and Mr. Stevenson Blackwood, who testified <lb/>
to the glorious words as having been the means of his <lb/>
conversion,&mdash;and so on.</p>
<p>We here take our leave of Miss Weston's noble work <lb/>
in the cause of religion and temperance amongst our <lb/>
<pb n="156" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0173"/>
blue-jackets. She has been a "hero in the fight," and <lb/>
has shed a lustre on the name of woman. Nor can we <lb/>
take leave of the subject without expressing our grateful <lb/>
thanks to Sophia G. Wintz for the delightful volume <lb/>
which we have made so liberal a use of in connection <lb/>
with "Miss Weston's Life and Work among our Sailors."</p>
<p>A noble work and a noble life indeed! It is hardly <lb/>
possible to recount the difficulties she has to overcome <lb/>
in her vast labours, which, had it not been for her <reg orig="re-|ligious">religious</reg> <lb/>
faith, she never could have sustained. Real <lb/>
difficulties, however, are the best cure of imaginary ones, <lb/>
because God helps us in the real ones and makes us <lb/>
ashamed of the others</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">All</hi> the heroisms of our Christian Women seem to <lb/>
be sustained by the power of the Bible over their <lb/>
souls. If proof were needed, can there be a greater one <lb/>
than this of its divinity. It has endowed women with <lb/>
unspeakable gifts, and given them the courage and <lb/>
bravery to go into haunts and hovels where men would <lb/>
quake to enter. It has made them fearless of censure <lb/>
or ridicule. With the banner of the Bible in their hands <lb/>
they have gone into savage lands and Christianized the <lb/>
heathen; they have been found amongst hordes of <lb/>
coarse sailors and blaspheming soldiers; they have <lb/>
picked up the waifs and strays from our lanes and <lb/>
alleys; they have tended the sick, raised homes for the <lb/>
fatherless, and reformatories for young criminals, and <lb/>
hospitals for all the "ills that flesh is heir to."</p>
<p>But recently Dean Vaughan, the Dean of Llandaff, at <lb/>
a meeting of the Bible Society, said, What a wonderful <lb/>
book is the Bible! How it stirred the minds and <lb/>
<pb n="158" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0175"/>
hearts even of those who were against it with feelings <lb/>
of hostility, but far more often of respect, and he would <lb/>
venture to hope almost as often of deep and heart-felt <lb/>
interest. We could not touch a word even in the <lb/>
English translation of the Bible without having the <lb/>
world attacking us.</p>
<p>He belonged to a body which for ten years has been <lb/>
occupied in trying to give greater exactness to the <lb/>
venerable version so dear to all their hearts. The very <lb/>
first rumour even of any one word being altered was <lb/>
considered a suitable subject for the columns of a <reg orig="news-|paper">newspaper</reg>, <lb/>
and brought about he knew not how many <reg orig="at-|tacks">attacks</reg> <lb/>
upon those who were audacious enough to <reg orig="pro-|pose">propose</reg> <lb/>
that any such touch should be given to that <lb/>
venerable work. He said this to show how deeply that <lb/>
Book, even in its English dress, which they must always <lb/>
remember was not the original dress, had entered into <lb/>
the hearts of the English people. But he thought he <lb/>
might claim, not for himself, but for his coadjutors in <lb/>
this work at least, the opportunity of furnishing an <reg orig="illus-|tration">illustration</reg> <lb/>
of the labour which men were willing to bestow <lb/>
upon this great Book&mdash;God's Holy Word. That body <lb/>
to which he had referred had been occupied now for ten <lb/>
years, for four days in every month but two, and for <lb/>
seven hours in each of these days, altogether amounting, <lb/>
if his arithmetic was correct, to something like 2,800 <lb/>
hours, in this work of endeavouring, if it be possible, to <lb/>
bring the English version into more exact conformity <lb/>
with the original. Was not that again a tribute to the <lb/>
<pb n="159" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0176"/>
wonderfulness of the Bible that there should be so much <lb/>
jealousy of the labours of this body of men?</p>
<p>What was the secret of all this? It was comprised <lb/>
in one word. It was because Scripture, all Scripture, <lb/>
was given by the inspiration of God. To put it into the <lb/>
more terse and nervous original, it was because "every <lb/>
Scripture was God-inspired," or let him rather say "<reg orig="God-|breathed">God-breathed</reg>." <lb/>
It was not unknown to many present that <lb/>
there was in Hebrew, in Greek, and in Latin, but one <lb/>
word for breath, wind, and spirit; and when St. Paul <lb/>
said this, he said there was the breath of God in it all. <lb/>
He asked them to reflect upon this meaning&mdash;whether <lb/>
it was not explanatory of the reverence and love with <lb/>
which the Bible was regarded. Divine inspiration! It <lb/>
could not be traced in its work; but it could be traced <lb/>
in its effect. Every one knew when the wind was <lb/>
blowing; they heard the sound of it. Thus they could <lb/>
trace inspiration, and in the pages of Holy Scripture <lb/>
they felt the effect thereof. There was a searching <lb/>
power in the breath of God, which, as the poet said, <lb/>
made every "little leaf sing." They could not open their <lb/>
Bibles without feeling themselves in the presence of that <lb/>
which was their judge. And if there was a searching <lb/>
power in the Divine inspiration, certainly there was also <lb/>
a cleansing power, for it was only he who desired to be <lb/>
free from his sins who could tolerate the hearty reading <lb/>
of the Bible. Then again there was another illustration. <lb/>
It was a refreshing power. They all knew what an <lb/>
effect in the sick-room the letting in of the pure breath <lb/>
<pb n="160" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0177"/>
of heaven had, how it diffused a fragrance through that <lb/>
room. So it was with the breath of God in the <lb/>
Bible.</p>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"Within this awful volume lies</l>
<l>The mystery of mysteries;</l>
<l>Happiest they of human race</l>
<l>To whom their God has given grace</l>
<l>To read, to fear, to hope, to pray,</l>
<l>To lift the latch, to force the way;</l>
<l>But better they had ne'er been born</l>
<l>Who read to doubt, or read to scorn."</l>
</lg></q>
<p>The Bible may indeed be called a treasure of the <lb/>
greatest magnitude in itself, without any decoration of <lb/>
art, or elucidation of genius. It is a treasure to all, <lb/>
rich and poor&mdash;the solace of the afflicted, the support of <lb/>
the dying; and while other books may amuse and <reg orig="in-|struct">instruct</reg> <lb/>
in a leisure hour, it is the peculiar triumph of this <lb/>
book to create light in the midst of darkness, to alleviate <lb/>
the sorrow that admits of no other alleviation; to direct <lb/>
a beam of hope to the heart when all other sources fail; <lb/>
while guilt, despair, and death vanish at the touch of its <lb/>
holy and sublime inspirations. After repeated perusals, <lb/>
it will still be invested with the charm of novelty, like <lb/>
the great orb of day, at which we gaze with increasing <lb/>
pleasure from infancy to old age. To sum up in the <lb/>
words of Locke,&mdash;</p>
<p>"It has God for its author, salvation for its end, and <lb/>
truth, without any mixture of error, for its matter;&mdash;it <lb/>
is all pure, all sincere, nothing too much, nothing <lb/>
wanting."</p>
<pb n="161" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0178"/>
<p>In these remarks upon the Bible, we are quite in <reg orig="ac-|cord">accord</reg> <lb/>
with that true Bible-woman, Mrs. Ranyard, than <lb/>
whom none have shown a greater zeal in disseminating <lb/>
the Scriptures and having them read and explained in <lb/>
the thousand homes of ignorance and vice. All her <lb/>
activity centred in this one object of her useful life.</p>
<p>It is now between thirty and forty years since the <lb/>
publication of an ode, entitled "The Border Land," and <lb/>
signed "L. N. R.," which at the time was extensively <lb/>
read, and made upon many a vivid impression. A lady <lb/>
having missed the letters of a friend, wrote to her asking, <lb/>
"Where have you been for a long time?" The reply, <lb/>
penned just outside of a room where sickness had for <lb/>
weeks hovered between life and death, suggested the ode, <lb/>
saying, "I have been to a Border Land where there was <lb/>
but a strange dim light, where shadows and dreams <lb/>
seemed real, where I scarce knew how there I came or <lb/>
if thence I should ever pass; where small seemed great <lb/>
as compared to the standards of earth, where the loss <lb/>
of all would scarce have cost a tear, where days wasted <lb/>
in worldly haste were recalled, and where the poor were <lb/>
brought to mind with their scant fire, and bread so hard <lb/>
to find, where I met with a wondrous Friend, whose <lb/>
words had power; and now I am come back again from <lb/>
that Border Land to earth, and should its trifles ever <lb/>
again engross me as in the past they have done, I will <lb/>
think of how empty and vain they seemed from the <lb/>
heights of the Border Land."</p>
<p>This strain forecast the mission of "L. N. R.;" and <lb/>
<pb n="162" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0179"/>
now that the tears of the Bible-women and the nurses <lb/>
have fallen around the grave of Mrs. Ranyard, many a <lb/>
one looking over the stanzas once more will in their <lb/>
touches see the prophetic hints of her life-work&mdash;a work <lb/>
rare and comely even in an age that has written a fair <lb/>
record of women's work for God.</p>
<p>The religious public first heard of Mrs. Ranyard as <lb/>
the author of "The Book and its Story," and "The Book <lb/>
and its Mission," and to the last, in all branches of her <lb/>
activity, it was to sow the incorruptible seed in hearts <lb/>
and homes that her gentle but irresistible enthusiasm <lb/>
burned. Her missions were all Bible Missions, her <lb/>
labourers Bible-women. Writing her last preface to a <lb/>
volume of her Magazine, she began by quoting a saying <lb/>
of Dr. Somerville to the effect that "faith in the Word <lb/>
of God" is the great need of Christian workers, and <lb/>
said: "Hereto we set our seal, after twenty-one years' <lb/>
work in the slums of London; though our voice is but <lb/>
as the voice of the little maid who waited on Naaman's <lb/>
wife of old."</p>
<p>Taking the Word as the one potent cure of all the <lb/>
diseases and leprosies of Society, she lived to give <reg orig="prac-|tical">practical</reg> <lb/>
application to the Bible work among the poor of <lb/>
London. Born, as we believe, in the great Babel, its <lb/>
multitudes were ever on her heart, and she never forgot <lb/>
the cheerless homes of the poor, which in the "Border <lb/>
Land" had been shown to her as in a vision. Reviewing <lb/>
twenty-one years' labour, she marked with intense <reg orig="in-|terest">interest</reg> <lb/>
the neighbourhoods she had first seen vacant, next <lb/>
<pb n="163" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0180"/>
built upon, then transformed or swept away. "The <lb/>
noisy trains" she cried, "have begun to find their way <lb/>
under old burying-grounds, so that even the dead must <lb/>
rest above the rushing tide of life."</p>
<p>To carry the Bible in letter and in spirit, its words <lb/>
read and explained, its pages printed in big type, its <lb/>
lessons and its hopes into the hearts, the chambers and <lb/>
work-day life of "low London," she proclaimed that the <lb/>
Missing Link was woman fulfilling her mission to her <lb/>
sisters yet unreclaimed. Not only did she write of the <lb/>
Missing Link, and with untiring energy conduct the <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Missing Link</hi> Magazine, but beginning, we know not how, <lb/>
in that silent way however in which works that are to <lb/>
grow take their origin, she trained Bible-women, planted <lb/>
them here and there, solicited and gained the co-<reg orig="opera-|tion">operation</reg> <lb/>
of ladies to superintend them, gave and got means <lb/>
of support, until there had grown up under her hand <lb/>
a vast and energetic agency, spread over London, and <lb/>
beginning to branch away into distant countries, even <lb/>
into Syria and Madagascar, into India, Italy and France. <lb/>
Her Bible looked not at man as a mere spirit, but as <lb/>
soul and body, and had its healing for the body as well <lb/>
as the soul; so beside her Bible-women and the <reg orig="mission-|room">missionroom</reg> <lb/>
gradually sprang up a nurse, and here again the <lb/>
links were not only between the direct labourer and the <lb/>
sufferers, but reached from both of these higher up; <lb/>
for her 70 nurses have 38 <hi rend="italic">nurse</hi> lady-superintendents to <lb/>
encourage, counsel, and co-operate with them; just as <lb/>
her 171 Bible-women have 133 <hi rend="italic">Bible</hi> lady-<reg orig="superinten-|dents">superintendents</reg>. <lb/>

Each of these learning and teaching lessons <lb/>
of sympathy for the lowest state of domestic life in <lb/>
London, serves as a link to raise the fallen, and to <lb/>
convey downward the aid of those who stand higher.</p>
<p>This great agency now in regular and energetic operation <lb/>
has been reared up by Mrs. Ranyard without any public <lb/>
society or costly organization. The British and Foreign <lb/>
Bible Society, indeed, has been the reserve on which she <lb/>
rested, as its work was the ideal of her mission. It gave <lb/>
a shilling a week towards the support of each of her <lb/>
Bible-women, and in return her Bible-women taught the <lb/>
poor mothers to work for and earn the price of a Bible <lb/>
in large print, and encouraged them to subscribe for it, <lb/>
and of such Bibles 176,000 had "been acquired by <lb/>
degrees and from their own savings." Some of those <lb/>
women who steadily subscribed could not read, but even <lb/>
of them, one now and then, after having made the book <lb/>
an ornament of the home, would carry in her memory <lb/>
the chapter read at the mother's meeting, and would get <lb/>
the husband, or the eldest girl, to read it by the fireside. <lb/>
But except the books and the small subsidy of the Bible <lb/>
Society, Mrs. Ranyard had to find all her resources <lb/>
where the Lord's labourers do marvellously find theirs&mdash; <lb/>
in the help of the Lord. Gradually friends gathered <lb/>
around her, and funds came in. At last her yearly <lb/>
balance-sheet showed some &pound;16,000 of income, of <lb/>
which total about one-third was paid by the <reg orig="subscrip-|tions">subscriptions</reg> <lb/>
of the poor for Bibles and clothing. The rest was <lb/>
the fund formed by donations for expenditure. We <lb/>
<pb n="165" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0182"/>
believe she had no formal committee; but a few friends <lb/>
occasionally met her and reviewed her affairs. To these <lb/>
she submitted her plans, and they took counsel as to her <lb/>
necessities. Her talents and her spirit&mdash;a spirit in <lb/>
which there was real light and sweetness&mdash;made to them <lb/>
co-operation easy and even agreeable. These meetings <lb/>
were held at the house of Lord Kinnaird, where, <reg orig="sup-|ported">supported</reg> <lb/>
by Mr. Ranyard, and in earlier times by her <lb/>
venerable father, the late Mr. Bazley White, and <reg orig="ani-|mated">animated</reg> <lb/>
by the steadfast encouragement of the veteran <lb/>
Earl of Shaftesbury, as well as by that of Lord and Lady <lb/>
Kinnaird, she would open her budget, smile over her <lb/>
difficulties, and leave all her friends under the feeling <lb/>
that the Lord who had hitherto gently cleared her way, <lb/>
would do so to the end.</p>
<p>Mrs. Ranyard lived to the verge of three-score years <lb/>
and ten. Nourished in youth by the ministry of Binney, <lb/>
she was enlisted in Bible work by the activity of the <lb/>
Lambeth Auxiliary to the Bible Society. Her family <lb/>
then living somewhere near Kennington Common, were <lb/>
intimate with that of Mr. Farmer, and the intimacy <lb/>
endured to the last. Among those who then helped the <lb/>
work of the Bible Society, she often named the first <lb/>
zealous labours of John and Edward Corderoy. Many <lb/>
of her Bible-women were Methodists. Mrs. Ranyard's <lb/>
removal must create a strange blank in the organization <lb/>
of which she was the mainspring. When here she never <lb/>
made much of herself&mdash;what Christian ever does?&mdash;now <lb/>
that she is gone her absence will cause a void that will <lb/>
not easily be filled.</p>
<pb n="166" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0183"/>
<p>A lady on one of the Bible-missions asked some poor <lb/>
women to write and tell her what they thought of the <lb/>
Bible-women. One gave an answer which many would <lb/>
give as to Mrs. Ranyard. "Why, ma'am, if I could <lb/>
write, I could fill a book with the acts of kindness I have <lb/>
received from her." Hundreds are thankful to-day that <lb/>
when in the Border Land so long ago she was sent back <lb/>
to earth with an errand. She has done her errand, and <lb/>
ere her final removal not a few, who had assisted in or <lb/>
benefited by its fulfilment, had gone before, among them <lb/>
a fair child of her own, grown to womanhood; she <lb/>
carried disease from the homes of the poor to her own <lb/>
home, and the disease carried her to the house of all <lb/>
living. There no small company of them have already <lb/>
given welcome to "L. N. R." on the shining shore <lb/>
beyond the Border Land, where they enjoy in all its <lb/>
fulness the unspeakable riches so beautifully expressed <lb/>
in her well-known ode:&mdash;</p>
<div3 type="poem" id="d27">
<head>THE BORDER LAND.</head>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>I have been to a land, a Border Land,</l>
<l rend="indent">Where there was but a strange dim light,</l>
<l>Where shadows and dreams, a spectral band,</l>
<l rend="indent">Seemed real to the aching sight.</l>
<l>I scarce bethought me how there I came,</l>
<l rend="indent">Or if thence I should pass again:</l>
<l>Its morning and night were marked by the flight</l>
<l rend="indent">Or coming of woe and pain.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>But I saw from this land, this Border Land,</l>
<l rend="indent">With its mountain ridges hoar,</l>
<l>They looked across to a wondrous strand,</l>
<l rend="indent">A bright and unearthly shore.</l>
<pb n="167" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0184"/>
<l>Then I turned me to Him, the Crucified,</l>
<l rend="indent">In most humble faith and prayer,</l>
<l>Who had ransomed with blood my sinful soul,</l>
<l rend="indent">For I thought He would call me there.</l>
</lg>
<p>The mind and character of this excellent woman have <lb/>
aided the mental and religious progress of thousands of <lb/>
the poor, and where the Bible had been before a sealed <lb/>
book, it is now their rest and comfort, their joy in life and <lb/>
their solace in death. Mrs. Ranyard early recognised <lb/>
the solemn duty and the glorious privilege of being a <lb/>
worker for God and her fellow-creatures; her mission <lb/>
was the dissemination of the Bible, and as we have <lb/>
already seen she performed her work in the most devoted <lb/>
manner. In her the "Missing Link" was found, and <lb/>
under her guidance, from the ranks of the lowly, women <lb/>
have been found and educated to become aids and <lb/>
comforts of their sister-woman, taking counsel together <lb/>
and reading the Word of God in company with a mutual <lb/>
comfort that no other agency is so well calculated to <lb/>
secure.</p>

&lsqb;<hi rend="small-caps">the christian mother of dr. andrew reed.</hi>&rsqb;</head>
<figure id="f16" rend="block" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0185"/>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Mrs. reed</hi>, the mother of Dr. Andrew Reed, and <lb/>
grandmother of Sir Charles Reed, is a <reg orig="remark-|able">remarkable</reg> <lb/>
instance of what piety, devotedness, and <reg orig="self-|renunciation">self-renunciation</reg> <lb/>
can effect. At one time a lonely woman, <lb/>
without wealth, station, or family influence, yet faithful <lb/>
to duty, blessing and blest in its performance&mdash;and <lb/>
"being dead yet speaketh."</p>
<p>The early training of Mrs. Reed, under a good mother, <lb/>
had given her a distaste to frivolous amusements, and <lb/>
her distinguished son, Dr. Andrew Reed, the modern <lb/>
philanthropist, was educated in the "way he should go," <lb/>
and he did not depart from it.</p>
<p>The life of woman usually so abounds in perpetually <lb/>
recurring domestic duties and minute cares for others, <lb/>
that she is in some danger of neglecting the improvement <lb/>
of her own mind, while so "careful and troubled about <lb/>
many things;" therefore the example of those who have <lb/>
been such economists of time as to neglect no duty to <lb/>
others, and yet to be true to themselves, by cultivating <lb/>
<pb n="169" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0186"/>
the faculties God entrusted to them, is truly valuable. <lb/>
As a model of self-culture Mrs. Reed was never excelled, <lb/>
and her excellent discipline bore fruit in her son, the <lb/>
founder of the London Orphan Asylum, the Infant <lb/>
Orphan Asylum, the Asylum for Fatherless Children, <lb/>
the Asylum for Idiots, and the Royal Hospital for <reg orig="In-|curables">Incurables</reg>.</p>
<p>Andrew Reed, the husband of Mrs. Reed, was a <lb/>
watchmaker by trade, and a truly religious man. <lb/>
Having established himself in London, his next <reg orig="con-|cern">concern</reg> <lb/>
was for means of Christian usefulness. While <lb/>
visiting a dying man, on a Sunday afternoon, in Drury <lb/>
Lane, he there first met with a young person who <reg orig="after-|wards">afterwards</reg> <lb/>
became his wife. He had obtained a home, a <lb/>
business, and a sphere of usefulness, and now was <reg orig="con-|ferred">conferred</reg> <lb/>
on him the blessing of a wife.</p>
<p>Young Andrew Reed listened to a female voice in <lb/>
the adjoining room, offering prayer, and after the prayer <lb/>
was over, he entered the room. There, by the bedside <lb/>
of a sick woman, was Mary Ann Mullen, a pious school <lb/>
teacher, and an orphan. Young Andrew, knowing that <lb/>
"a good wife is from the Lord," fixed his thoughts upon <lb/>
this young woman, wisely concluding that such a partner <lb/>
was a priceless treasure for a lonely Christian man. <reg orig="Ac-|cordingly">Accordingly</reg>, <lb/>
after this strange introduction, he formed the <lb/>
friendship, and made Miss Mullen an offer of marriage. <lb/>
She was suffering by reason of oppression and fraud at <lb/>
this time; her father and mother were both dead, and <lb/>
her stepmother had succeeded, after her father's death, <lb/>
<pb n="170" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0187"/>
in robbing her of her rightful inheritance, and in casting <lb/>
her out of her home. Thus oppressed, Miss Mullen did <lb/>
not sit down in despair, or waste her in time in <reg orig="unavail-|ing">unavailing</reg> <lb/>
lamentations. She looked about for honest means <lb/>
of living, and being of an intelligent and active turn of <lb/>
mind, and "apt to teach," she had adopted the vocation <lb/>
of teacher, and opened a private school in Little Britain <lb/>
there diligently toiling day by day in training the young <lb/>
and at the same time earning a respectable living for <lb/>
herself. Nor was this all her employment, for she, too, <lb/>
must be "about the Master's business." Her energetic <lb/>
and philanthropic spirit found scope in visiting among <lb/>
the sick and afflicted, and in performing other gracious <lb/>
works of charity among the poor.</p>
<p>Marriage succeeded to courtship, and the youthful <lb/>
couple took each other "for better, for worse." After <lb/>
marriage, the wife, true to the God-given title of "help <lb/>
meet," assisted her husband by keeping on her school. <lb/>
In course of time they migrated from Bartholomew <lb/>
Close to Butcher Row, St. Clement Danes, where they <lb/>
occupied Beaumont House, an old-fashioned, roomy, <lb/>
quaint building, a relic of olden times. In 1603 the <lb/>
Duke of Sully resided in Beaumont House, and had <lb/>
kept court there. Now it was devoted to less <reg orig="aristo-|cratic">aristocratic</reg>, <lb/>
but more useful purposes. Here Mr. Reed <lb/>
opened his shop, and Mrs. Reed carried on her school; <lb/>
he occupying the garret for his manufactory, and she, <lb/>
the ample old drawing-room. Here, too, they <reg orig="ex-|perienced">experienced</reg> <lb/>
life's trials, for they were called to mourn over <lb/>
<pb n="171" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0188"/>
the early deaths of their first three children; and here, <lb/>
after these bereavements, Andrew, the greatest <reg orig="philan-|thropist">philanthropist</reg> <lb/>
of modern times, was born, November 27th, <lb/>
1787. Mrs. Reed kept a diary, in which she records <lb/>
the more striking events of their life. On moving into <lb/>
Beaumont House, she says that their home was <reg orig="dedi-|cated">dedicated</reg> <lb/>
to God in prayer, using the following words: "We <lb/>
had at our house to-night Mr. Winter and other friends, <lb/>
for thanksgiving for God's goodness since we came <reg orig="to-|gether">together</reg>." <lb/>
Note the pious woman's faith. "God's <reg orig="good-|ness">goodness</reg> <lb/>
since we came together," is remembered before all <lb/>
reverses, trials, or bereavements. So they set up their <lb/>
Ebenezer, and took fresh courage in view of the future.</p>
<p>Mrs. Reed was the mother of a large family, of whom, <lb/>
however, only three survived, namely, Andrew, Martha, <lb/>
and Peter. These children were trained up tenderly <lb/>
and piously, and were inseparable companions both at <lb/>
home and at school. The training which they received <lb/>
was such as fitted them for this world, and taught them <lb/>
to understand their responsibilities in relation to that <lb/>
which is to come.</p>
<p>Andrew Reed, the elder, used to say that "a good <lb/>
education is a fortune a child can never spend, and a <lb/>
parent can always bestow." In obedience to this maxim, <lb/>
Mr. and Mrs. Reed endeavoured to gain the best <reg orig="pos-|sible">possible</reg> <lb/>
education for their boy. But, says his mother, <lb/>
in her journal, "This we do at some sacrifice, for war <lb/>
taxes are fearful, and bread is sixteenpence-halfpenny the <lb/>
quartern loaf. Yet it was said in Parliament that the <lb/>
<pb n="172" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0189"/>
wheat wasted every year in hair powder would make <lb/>
more than a million loaves, and Mr. Pitt could not deny <lb/>
it. Still, the best education we can get the boy shall <lb/>
have, for he is a lad of good promise."</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Reed seem to have kept up a "<reg orig="pro-|phet's">prophet's</reg> <lb/>
chamber," for we find that young Andrew was <lb/>
introduced to some of the excellent of the earth, in the <lb/>
ministerial profession, early in life. When he was only <lb/>
eight years of age, a Rev. Mr. Eyre, one of the founders <lb/>
of the London Missionary Society, and the Rev. <reg orig="Mat-|thew">Matthew</reg> <lb/>
Wilks, met Mr. Reed in his little back parlour, and <lb/>
there discussed the question of missions to the heathen. <lb/>
Mr. Eyre read a paper upon the subject, to which <lb/>
the boy listened attentively. The Rev. Richard Winter, <lb/>
the pastor of the Reeds, was upon his death-bed when <lb/>
Andrew was about twelve of age, and Mrs. Reed, ever <lb/>
anxious that her boy's mind should be turned into a <lb/>
good channel, took her son to see this dying saint. It <lb/>
is recorded that Mr. Winter's dying words made a great <lb/>
impression upon him. Before this time she had also <lb/>
led her boy to St. Paul's Cathedral, and standing by <lb/>
the statue erected to the memory of John Howard, had <lb/>
talked in familiar language of the work of that illustrious <lb/>
philanthropist. What she said sank deeply into young <lb/>
Andrew's heart; and there is no question but that such <lb/>
teachings as these, from Mrs. Reed's lips, materially <lb/>
assisted in moulding the opinions and forming the life <lb/>
of the lad, so that in after years he strove to emulate, <lb/>
by his works of mercy and charity, the example of him <lb/>
<pb n="173" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0190"/>
who was accounted worthy of a niche among England's <lb/>
heroes. Indeed, Mrs. Reed's anxiety on behalf of her <lb/>
boy becomes apparent in almost every step. She took <lb/>
him to missionary meetings, and together they witnessed <lb/>
the setting apart of two young pioneer missionaries to <lb/>
their work. Next morning, Mrs. Reed, whose heart <lb/>
had been full all night, rose up at break of day and <lb/>
pleaded earnestly "that some good thing might appear <lb/>
in the heart of her boy." That very day the <reg orig="foreshadow-|ing">foreshadowing</reg> <lb/>
of the answer came, for it was the Sabbath; and as <lb/>
young Reed sat in the house of God, his conscience <lb/>
was aroused by the words to which he listened.</p>
<p>A good conscience is better than two witnesses. It <lb/>
will consume your grief as the sun dissolves ice. It is <lb/>
a spring when you are thirsty, a staff when you are <lb/>
weary, a screen when the sun burns you, a pillow in <lb/>
death.</p>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"Yet still there whispers the small voice within,</l>
<l>Heard through Gain's silence, and through Glory's din;</l>
<l>Whatever creed be taught, or land be trod,</l>
<l>Man's conscience is the oracle of God."</l>
</lg></q>
<p>Mrs. Reed well knew that a child of four years old <lb/>
knows right from wrong as well as a person of forty; <lb/>
and that the boy who lies at four years old will lie when <lb/>
he grows up; and it is to prevent this that he ought to <lb/>
be reasoned or punished out of this fault when a child. <lb/>
Conscience is the book, when death is near, where we <lb/>
see all our sins written in characters of fire.</p>
<p>Now another time of anxiety approached for the mother <lb/>
<pb n="174" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0191"/>
of young Andrew; he was to be bound apprentice. The <lb/>
lad was fifteen, impressed but not yet decided. But <lb/>
his Christian mother remembered her young son day <lb/>
and night before God. Once or twice, by wicked <lb/>
example, he was led astray; but his mother gave him a <lb/>
pamphlet, Dr. Watts' "Advice to a Young Man." This <lb/>
pamphlet Andrew read, and from that time knew no rest <lb/>
until he felt his feet firmly fixed upon the Rock of Ages. <lb/>
From this moment Mrs. Reed knew no more trouble <lb/>
with her young son; and encouraged by her, he <reg orig="cove-|nanted">covenanted</reg> <lb/>
to devote his whole life to the service of God. <lb/>
To this decision, and to the counsels and prayers of his <lb/>
pious mother, the world doubtless owes those grand <lb/>
asylums of mercy and benevolence which are so <reg orig="inse-|parably">inseparably</reg> <lb/>
associated with the name of Dr. Andrew Reed.</p>
<p>After her marriage Mrs. Reed still kept to her work of <lb/>
school-teaching, while her singular energy and industry <lb/>
enabled her to be in no way lacking in respect of <reg orig="house-|wifely">housewifely</reg> <lb/>
duties. Domestic dawdlers are not the best <lb/>
managers, even though they keep aloof from all <reg orig="intellec-|tual">intellectual</reg> <lb/>
or useful pursuits. Usually the well-stored brain <lb/>
the well-trained heart and the well-managed home go <lb/>
together. It was eminently so in Mrs. Reed's case. It <lb/>
appears from the testimony of her distinguished <reg orig="grand-|son">grandson</reg>, <lb/>
Sir Charles Reed, President of the London School <lb/>
Board, that she kept her school even at this date, and <lb/>
with much success. Mr. and Mrs. Reed managed thus <lb/>
to save money; and when, finally a legacy came to <lb/>
them, she felt that she could conscientiously relinquish <lb/>
<pb n="175" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0192"/>
her school, and take life a little more restfully. This <lb/>
rest did not last long, however. Seeing that worldly <lb/>
matters were prospering with them, Mrs. Reed began <lb/>
to urge her husband to take up some more settled work <lb/>
in the Church. In her diary is this entry:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I begin to entreat my husband to do something more <lb/>
for Christ. A missionary spirit seems to run through <lb/>
the Christian Church, and among the rest my heart is <lb/>
in the enterprise." Then again&mdash;</p>
<p>"I have been long trying to get my dear partner to <lb/>
engage in itinerant preaching to the poor heathen around <lb/>
us; and this, my desire, is now fulfilled. Many have <lb/>
had reason to bless God for his private converse, and <lb/>
this offers one reason why I wish him to launch forth <lb/>
into more public service."</p>
<p>Now comes out in a very striking light the Christian <lb/>
heroism of Mrs. Reed. Not content with urging her <lb/>
husband to more active service in the work of the <lb/>
Gospel, she studies and plans how to enable him to <lb/>
devote his <hi rend="italic">entire</hi> attention to it. She would have him <lb/>
free from the burden and care of business that he may <lb/>
fit himself for his work. She says in her diary&mdash;</p>
<p>"Seeing how much preparedness is needed, I would <lb/>
have his mind quite free for his new engagement. I <lb/>
propose to go into some business myself, wishing by all <lb/>
possible means in my power to give my husband all <lb/>
scope for study; and if I can help it, he shall not even <lb/>
take coach-hire &lpar;when needful so to journey&rpar; from the <lb/>
poor godly folk he goes to minister unto."</p>
<pb n="176" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0193"/>
<p>Accordingly Mrs. Reed opened on her own account, <lb/>
in Barbican, a china shop, and as was their wont, the <lb/>
new undertaking was sanctified by prayer and <reg orig="thanks-|giving">thanksgiving</reg>. <lb/>
Brave in her Christian devotion, Mrs. Reed <lb/>
stood behind the counter and sold Staffordshire wares for <lb/>
many years; and her grandson remarks, that "Divine <lb/>
Providence prospered her greatly."</p>
<p>All this time her husband and son &lpar;the future Dr. <lb/>
Andrew Reed&rpar; were working and studying together&mdash;the <lb/>
elder Reed to benefit souls, and the younger to fit <reg orig="him-|self">himself</reg> <lb/>
for college. Sabbath after Sabbath the two would <lb/>
travel off together, young Andrew carrying the Bible and <lb/>
Concordance, full of honest love to souls, and his father <lb/>
bearing the message of salvation to attentive <reg orig="congrega-|tions">congregations</reg> <lb/>
in the suburbs of London. As they returned home <lb/>
at night after their long walks, father and son would often <lb/>
sing hymns or repeat texts to enliven the journey; and <lb/>
on reaching home, where a warm welcome awaited them, <lb/>
the good wife and mother would earnestly inquire as to <lb/>
the labours of the day. And none had more right to <lb/>
ask, for none had more interest in the work; for was it <lb/>
not by her instrumentality that the sinews of war were <lb/>
raised? Had it not been for her china shop, Mr. Reed <lb/>
could not have laid aside his watchmaking and devoted <lb/>
himself, as he did for twenty years, to the work of <lb/>
preaching the Gospel gratuitously.</p>
<p>Young Andrew posted up the accounts at the shop <lb/>
at night during the first two or three years of this time, <lb/>
preparing himself during the day for college. We find <lb/>
<pb n="177" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0194"/>
that Mrs. Reed kept keen but loving watch over her <lb/>
boy's doings; for when he sought out acquaintances who <lb/>
could argue on theological matters, she records the fact <lb/>
in her diary, and wonders whether "he was not losing <lb/>
himself in philosophical nothings." But one day, soon <lb/>
after, she accidentally knocked his desk over, and while <lb/>
putting its contents right again, noticed some evangelical <lb/>
discourses written by him, which allayed her fears; and <lb/>
in her zeal and thankfulness she hurried off to the <reg orig="book-|seller's">bookseller's</reg> <lb/>
and bought the "Life of George Whitefield," in <lb/>
two or three volumes. Coming home, she put these <lb/>
volumes quietly into his desk, and then going away to <lb/>
her own room, she prayed earnestly "that her boy might <lb/>
be like that man." About this time she writes: "As to <lb/>
my dear husband and dear boy, I hope I can say, I <lb/>
would rather see them sweeping the street than <reg orig="preach-|ing">preaching</reg> <lb/>
without due acknowledgment of the blessed Spirit."</p>
<p>Finally, after much conscientious preparation, "her <lb/>
boy" was invited to enter college by ministers who knew <lb/>
him, and knew his parentage. This was another <reg orig="oc-|casion">occasion</reg> <lb/>
for thanksgiving, and the youth records in his <lb/>
diary:</p>
<p>"On Good Friday, March 26th, my parents had a <lb/>
meeting for the purpose of prayer and praise&mdash;praise <lb/>
for the Lord's goodness manifested to them through the <lb/>
last seven years, and prayer for the Lord's peculiar <reg orig="bless-|ing">blessing</reg> <lb/>
upon me in preparing for the work of the ministry. <lb/>
Rev. Dr. Winter and other friends were present. I <lb/>
hope to reap unspeakable advantage from these prayers."</p>
<pb n="178" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0195"/>
<p>In the "Life of Dr. Andrew Reed," by his son, to <lb/>
which we are indebted for most of these particulars, <lb/>
this weighty remark is made: "This is another of those <lb/>
frequent notices of home gatherings for special devotion, <lb/>
which from the first have distinguished this family at <lb/>
critical periods in domestic history."</p>
<p>Mrs. Reed had prayed for years that her son might <lb/>
be counted worthy to enter the ministry; and now her <lb/>
prayers were so abundantly answered that she could <lb/>
scarcely realize it. Almost before his college course was <lb/>
ended, invitations flowed in upon him from all quarters, <lb/>
including one from the very church with which Mr. and <lb/>
Mrs. Reed were connected, and where he himself had <lb/>
communed from his youth. This invitation appears to <lb/>
have overcome Mrs. Reed with surprise and joy. She <lb/>
says: "Indeed, I had something of the Queen of Sheba's <lb/>
sensations when I heard of it, and had no spirit in me." <lb/>
We cannot doubt that the grateful mother recalled her <lb/>
early years of faith and prayer on behalf of her boy, and <lb/>
recognised in all this the abundant answer.</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Reed, we gather from their memoir <lb/>
in the <hi rend="italic">Weekly Welcome</hi> &lpar;Partridge &amp; Co.&rpar;, lived to <lb/>
see their son famous for his labours of love for the <lb/>
general weal. The London Orphan Asylum and the <lb/>
Infant Orphan Asylum were both founded before their <lb/>
death. In 1832 Dr. Reed's mother died. He felt the <lb/>
blow most acutely. His mother&mdash;"a mother in Israel" <lb/>
&mdash;had fallen, and very bitter was the stroke. But her <lb/>
influence yet lived, for from that day he threw himself <lb/>
<pb n="179" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0196"/>
more intensely, heart and soul, into the grand work <lb/>
of blessing the human race, while the memory of his <lb/>
mother, ever fragrant with the incense of a holy life, <lb/>
stimulated and animated him. We make no doubt <lb/>
but that the remembrance of Mrs. Reed's self-denying <lb/>
labours in her little school and in the china shop, was <lb/>
the means of inciting and cheering her son to yet more <lb/>
arduous enterprises. And, fired with the earnest <reg orig="devoted-|ness">devotedness</reg> <lb/>
of both father and mother, Dr. Reed pursued in <lb/>
walks of greater fame, honour, and usefulness the course <lb/>
which, years before, she had followed for herself. And <lb/>
his son, the present Sir Charles Reed, M.P., has ever <lb/>
walked in his father's footsteps, and has as much <reg orig="dis-|tinguished">distinguished</reg> <lb/>
himself in the noble cause of education, as <lb/>

<figure id="f18" rend="block" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0197"/>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Quite</hi> apart from this excellent lady having been <lb/>
sthe wife of the Venerable Archbishop of <reg orig="Canter-|bury">Canterbury</reg>, <lb/>
she must have place among our distinguished <lb/>
"Christian Women." She was highly gifted, and <reg orig="conse-|crated">consecrated</reg> <lb/>
her gifts to the service of the Master she so <lb/>
worthily served.</p>
<p>She was the youngest daughter of Archdeacon Spooner, <lb/>
while her uncle by marriage was the venerable William <lb/>
Wilberforce. She was born in 1819, at the parsonage of <lb/>
Elmdon, in Warwickshire. Her whole early life was <lb/>
spent among country scenes, so favourable to thought <lb/>
and devotion, for all the purest works of God are there <lb/>
in all their loveliest beauty.</p>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"Receded hills afar of softened blue,</l>
<l>Tall bowering trees, through which the sunbeams shoot</l>
<l>Down to the waveless lake; birds never mute;</l>
<l>And wild flowers all around of every hue.</l>
<l>Sure 'tis a lovely scene; there, knee-deep, stand,</l>
<l>Safe from the fierce sun, the o'ershadowed kine,</l>
<pb n="181" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0198"/>
<l>And, to the left where cultured fields expand,</l>
<l>'Mid tufts of scented thorn the sheep recline:&mdash;</l>
<l>Lone quiet farmsteads, haunts that ever please&mdash;</l>
<l>Oh, how inviting to the wanderer's eye</l>
<l>Ye rise on yonder uplands, 'mid your trees</l>
<l>Of shade and shelter! Every sound from there</l>
<l>Is eloquent of peace, of earth, and sky,</l>
<l>And pastoral beauty and Arcadian ease."</l>
</lg></q>
<p>Yes, amidst such country scenes as the poet has <lb/>
described, Catherine Spooner spent her days of <reg orig="maiden-|hood">maidenhood</reg> <lb/>
at her father's parsonage, and it is related of her <lb/>
that she never saw the sea until within a year or two of <lb/>
her marriage. But it must not be inferred from this <lb/>
seclusion that her life was either dull or useless. Both <lb/>
she and her sister took a devoted interest in all the great <lb/>
concerns of the world, political, religious, and <reg orig="intel-|lectual">intellectual</reg>. <lb/>
Catherine Spooner's mind was highly <reg orig="culti-|vated">cultivated</reg>, <lb/>
and her domestic life overflowed with happiness. <lb/>
Parish visiting, improving reading, and country walks <lb/>
with her beloved father, Archdeacon Spooner, formed <lb/>
the daily routine of her life. She was a bright girl, <lb/>
lovely in person, and the sunshine and delight of her <lb/>
whole household, full of elasticity and spirit, yet free <lb/>
from youthful thoughtlessness. From an early age she <lb/>
seems to have manifested an earnest and simple piety, <lb/>
that piety which includes faith, devotion, resignation, <lb/>
and that love and gratitude to God which stimulates us <lb/>
to inquire His will, and perform it, so far as the weakness <lb/>
and imperfection of our nature permit. It offers the <lb/>
best foundation, not only for solid happiness, but for <lb/>
<pb n="182" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0199"/>
that serenity of temper, and disposition to innocent <lb/>
gaiety, which is at once the charm and the privilege of <lb/>
youth. The lofty aspirations the deep humility, and <lb/>
unshrinking confidence of a Christian, in those moments <lb/>
when the soul may be said to "commune with God," <lb/>
can have no other effect on any well-regulated mind, <lb/>
than that of adding sweetness to the usual intercourse, <lb/>
and interest to the common incidents of life.</p>
<p>The piety, indeed, of Catherine Spooner has been <lb/>
well described by Cowper,&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"True piety is cheerful as the day;</l>
<l>Will weep, indeed, and leave a pitying groan</l>
<l>For other's woes, but smiles upon her own."</l>
</lg></q>
There was about her a beauty of holiness, which <lb/>
effloresces on the countenance, the manner, and the <lb/>
outward path.</p>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"Lo, such the child whose early feet</l>
<l rend="indent">The paths of peace have trod;</l>
<l>Whose secret heart, with influence sweet,</l>
<l rend="indent">Is upward drawn to God."</l>
</lg></q>
<p>When a very young girl she would slip quietly out of <lb/>
the room, when the family were assembled in the <reg orig="even-|ing">evening</reg>, <lb/>
to spend an hour in instructing some of the younger <lb/>
servants who had no interval of leisure earlier. Every <lb/>
morning she went to her mother's room to read the <lb/>
Bible with her before she rose.</p>
<p>At the age of twenty the deep sense of religion seems <lb/>
to have been intensified and quickened by a remarkable <lb/>
<pb n="183" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0200"/>
personal experience of her own which she mentioned to <lb/>
a friend who relates it. On some occasion of keen <lb/>
enjoyment from the earthly pleasures and blessings <reg orig="sur-|rounding">surrounding</reg> <lb/>
her, she seemed to hear the words,&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"But make for the higher."</l>
</lg></q>
She felt as if this were a direct message from God, and <lb/>
it met with ready response in her heart.</p>
<p>She had been brought up in sound, simple, <reg orig="evan-|gelical">evangelical</reg> <lb/>
views. This early training had comprised close <lb/>
and intimate acquaintance with the Bible. From <lb/>
earliest childhood she had been familiar with the sacred <lb/>
Book; knew much of it by heart, especially the Psalms, <lb/>
and was seldom at a loss to find any passage. Prayer <lb/>
was the mainspring of her life, as her husband, the <lb/>
Archbishop of Canterbury, bears witness in his memoir <lb/>
of her, and from which we obtain the facts imported <lb/>
into our narrative; the services of the Church were dear <lb/>
to her as the expression of her own feelings; and <lb/>
though strongly attached to the use of books of <reg orig="devo-|tion">devotion</reg>, <lb/>
they never took the place of personal and <reg orig="unpre-|meditated">unpremeditated</reg> <lb/>
prayer, both alone and with others when <lb/>
called for.</p>
<p>One of Catherine's sisters had married the Rev. <lb/>
Edward Fortescue, a young clergyman of high character <lb/>
and intense enthusiasm, but who was unhappily imbued <lb/>
with the then newly-developed Oxford School of High <lb/>
Church Theology, first set forth in the famous "Tracts <lb/>
for the Times." His somewhat romantic ascetic <reg orig="char-|acter">character</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="184" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0201"/>
was just the one to charm an eager and <reg orig="impression-|able">impressionable</reg> <lb/>
girl's imagination, and he gained a powerful <reg orig="in-|fluence">influence</reg> <lb/>
over his wife's sisters, and especially the subject <lb/>
of this memoir. Her parents, as we have seen, were <lb/>
firm and consistent evangelical Protestants, and had <lb/>
brought up Catherine as such; but the views now <lb/>
brought before her had the attraction of novelty. She <lb/>
blindly believed that they showed her the true teaching <lb/>
of the Church to which she was attached, and with all <lb/>
the romance and impulsiveness of youth she threw <lb/>
herself into the movement, which to her appeared the <lb/>
ideal of all that was venerable and beautiful.</p>
<p>"She &lpar;Catherine Spooner&rpar; was not the first, nor will <lb/>
be the last," well remarks a writer in the <hi rend="italic">Sunday at <lb/>
Home</hi>, "of those who have been led by their fervid <lb/>
imaginations to do battle for an ideal to whose true <lb/>
character they are wholly blind. She little guessed to <lb/>
what spiritual slavery, to what earthly worship and <reg orig="soul-|less">soulless</reg> <lb/>
ceremonial, that apparently attractive and exalted <lb/>
path leads."</p>
<p>The mistake was fostered by the real sincerity and <lb/>
devotedness of Mr. Fortescue, who at this time was <lb/>
labouring, with extraordinary energy and self-sacrifice, to <lb/>
reclaim a miserably neglected hamlet some few miles <lb/>
from his home. Catherine was his frequent companion <lb/>
and assistant in his work there. On occasions when <lb/>
returning at night was difficult or impossible, he <reg orig="ob-|tained">obtained</reg> <lb/>
the loan of some rooms in an unoccupied <reg orig="farm-|house">farmhouse</reg> <lb/>
for himself and his wife or sisters. The young <lb/>
<pb n="185" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0202"/>
girl rejoiced in the discomforts of the cold attic, with <lb/>
potato sacks in one corner, which was often her <reg orig="accom-|modation">accommodation</reg> <lb/>
for the night on these occasions, and longed <lb/>
to make her life entirely one of such abnegation.</p>
<p>It was natural she should fail to distinguish between <lb/>
cheerfully meeting privations when they came in the <lb/>
path of duty, and seeking them for their own sake as if <lb/>
they were in themselves privileges.</p>
<p>But a less healthy influence was given by her <reg orig="brother-|in-law's">brother-in-law's</reg> <lb/>
manner of passing Good Friday, which he <lb/>
instructed his sisters to spend in solitary fasting and <lb/>
prayer in their own rooms, the silence only broken by <lb/>
his pronouncing at intervals in solemn tones at their <lb/>
open doors the seven last words of the Saviour on the <lb/>
Cross. Such excitement could not but work hurtfully on <lb/>
the nerves of sensitive girls, and has nothing in common <lb/>
with the apostle's calm and sober determination to <lb/>
"know nothing but Jesus Christ and Him crucified."</p>
<p>Happily Catherine was never carried away beyond <lb/>
a certain point. Her convictions had widely diverged <lb/>
from those of her brother-in-law long before his opinions <lb/>
had led him to their legitimate and natural conclusion&mdash; <lb/>
secession to the Church of Rome. From these extreme <lb/>
views she was mercifully and wholly delivered; and <lb/>
though the High Church bias remained more or less <lb/>
powerfully through life, there were counteracting <reg orig="in-|fluences">influences</reg> <lb/>
at work, which after those early days had <lb/>
doubtless a considerable effect on her character and <lb/>
opinions.</p>
<pb n="186" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0203"/>
<p>Another counteracting influence which could be more <lb/>
easily perceived by all, was her marriage, in 1843, to <lb/>
Dr. Tait, then recently elected to the head mastership <lb/>
of Rugby school, left vacant by Dr. Arnold's death.</p>
<p>It was curious that at the time of the election of <lb/>
1842, when she had heard that one of the four <reg orig="pro-|testing">protesting</reg> <lb/>
tutors who had helped to bring the series of <lb/>
Oxford tracts to a close was a candidate, she had <lb/>
earnestly hoped, as she afterwards declared, that he <lb/>
would <hi rend="italic">not</hi> succeed.</p>
<p>"It was a strange turn of fate," writes her husband, <lb/>
"which made her open her heart next year to the very <lb/>
candidate whose success she had deprecated, and <reg orig="be-|come">become</reg> <lb/>
the happy partner of his life, the sharer of all his <lb/>
deepest and truest interests, helping forward for <reg orig="thirty-|five">thirty-five</reg> <lb/>
years every good work he was called to promote, <lb/>
united to him in the truest fellowship of soul."</p>
<p>Her "Oxford bias" may in after life have led her <lb/>
to support, in some cases, institutions whose monastic <lb/>
element others would consider overbalanced the material <lb/>
good they effected; but she was large-hearted through <lb/>
all to an eminent degree; ready to appreciate the good <lb/>
in those who differed from her, and her husband's own <lb/>
record of her is that she never conversed with a <reg orig="spirit-|ually-minded">spiritually-minded</reg> <lb/>
Christian of any denomination without her <lb/>
heart warming to him. She even joined occasionally in <lb/>
Scotland in the services of the parish church, where <lb/>
none of her own communion were attainable; and once, <lb/>
in a time of deep sorrow, found comfort from one she <lb/>
attended.</p>
<pb n="187" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0204"/>
<p>In the summer of 1843 her marriage took her straight <lb/>
from the quiet home life at the parsonage to the exciting, <lb/>
busy life of Rugby, with its atmosphere full of <reg orig="contro-|versy">controversy</reg> <lb/>
and speculation, and its varying and conflicting <lb/>
interests and opinions. Such an atmosphere was one <lb/>
to bewilder a stranger coming from such different <reg orig="sur-|roundings">surroundings</reg>, <lb/>
and an enthusiastic young woman might <lb/>
easily have been led into making mistakes which would <lb/>
have in some way compromised her husband's work. <lb/>
But all such dangers melted away before the continual <lb/>
habit of prayer she brought with her. Hard and anxious <lb/>
work hers and her husband's was, but she threw herself <lb/>
into it with the keenest zest. She took pains, as her <lb/>
beloved and honoured predecessor had ever done, to <lb/>
become acquainted with the boys; had the younger ones <lb/>
to tea, and laid herself out to amuse them. She <reg orig="con-|stantly">constantly</reg> <lb/>
visited the sick ones in the infirmary, read and <lb/>
prayed with them, and brought instructive and amusing <lb/>
books to beguile the lonely hours of the convalescents. <lb/>
And "a whole multitude of evidences," writes her <reg orig="bio-|grapher">biographer</reg>, <lb/>
"tell how she was worshipped by the boys, the <lb/>
chivalrous, romantic admiration of her youth and beauty <lb/>
being joined to their grateful sense of her kindliness."</p>
<p>One boy, who lost his mother while at Rugby, writes <lb/>
he never forgot the tender sympathy showed him by <lb/>
"the doctor's beautiful young wife." "How she sent <lb/>
for me and soothed my grief, telling me to look up to <lb/>
the home above, to which my mother had been taken, <lb/>
and follow her there."</p>
<pb n="188" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0205"/>
<p>She was constantly active, also, among the poor, and <lb/>
established a small girls' school, in which she taught <lb/>
almost daily.</p>
<p>They were seldom without friends in the house, and <lb/>
she was in the habit of drawing her young guests to help <lb/>
her in her charitable labours in visiting the almshouses, <lb/>
helping in collections for clothing clubs, and the like, <lb/>
All the spare moments of the day were gathered up and <lb/>
used for work or interesting and profitable reading. <lb/>
"We have just five, or ten minutes, or a quarter," she <lb/>
would say to a friend who used to come to her room <lb/>
after the early weekday service before breakfast; "let us <lb/>
read," and the book and work were ready at once.</p>
<p>"But she was never more happy," writes her husband, <lb/>
"than when helping me to get up my history lessons, or <lb/>
galloping by my side in the green lanes or over the <lb/>
meadows." In the vacations, till her family cares began, <lb/>
which was not for the first two years, she accompanied <lb/>
him in tours in Germany and Italy, and enjoyed every <lb/>
object of interest with the same eager zest.</p>
<p>But all was "sanctified by the word of God and <lb/>
prayer."</p>
<p>"I remember," writes her niece, "being very much <lb/>
struck when I was a little girl, when just before you and <lb/>
she were starting to go off somewhere&mdash;I forget where&mdash; <lb/>
she asked you to kneel down and pray for a blessing on <lb/>
your journey."</p>
<p>From an early period she not only relieved her <lb/>
husband of the complicated accounts of his large <lb/>
<pb n="189" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0206"/>
household and the schoolhouse, but assisted in the still <lb/>
more intricate and difficult ones of the general school <lb/>
funds; and when, in 1848, Dr. Tait was laid up with <lb/>
dangerous illness, and his life hung on a thread, she was <lb/>
able to help his two brothers, who came to settle the <lb/>
school accounts in his place, to disentangle the <reg orig="intri-|cacies">intricacies</reg> <lb/>
in the work which were unintelligible to them <lb/>
without her aid. She continued to manage the financial <lb/>
affairs in the same way through life. She it was who <lb/>
guarded him during that illness with sedulous care, and <lb/>
who, all through, was not only his tender and efficient <lb/>
nurse, but his comforter, ever ready to pray with him <lb/>
and soothe him with helpful words of Scripture and <lb/>
hymns. Both in this illness and in the equally alarming <lb/>
one he had twenty years later, her soul, as she declared, <lb/>
was constantly stayed on those words in Isaiah l. 10: <lb/>
"Who is he that walketh in darkness, and hath no <lb/>
light? let him trust in the name of the Lord, and stay <lb/>
upon his God."</p>
<p>Soon after his recovery, Dr. Tait was appointed Dean <lb/>
of Carlisle. And here Mrs. Tait was, as before, <reg orig="indefa-|tigable">indefatigable</reg> <lb/>
in charitable labours, and broke through the old <lb/>
prescribed ideas of cathedral etiquette by making her <lb/>
home the centre to which the poor looked for sympathy <lb/>
and help.</p>
<p>When she left Rugby, she was already the mother of <lb/>
three children, and four more were born during the <lb/>
seven years of their residence in Carlisle. Every day, at <lb/>
the first spare time she could command, she would sally <lb/>
<pb n="190" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0207"/>
forth with the little party in their open car to enjoy the <lb/>
fresh air; and in the long summer days, her delight was <lb/>
to wander with them beyond the smoke of the city, <lb/>
seeking wild flowers in the woods, or loitering by the <lb/>
river side. As the elder ones grew to an age to <reg orig="under-|stand">understand</reg>, <lb/>
she spent happy hours in reading with them, and <lb/>
training them to an interest in all the good works in <lb/>
which she was engaged. A happier little circle could <lb/>
scarcely have been found; but there was coming a <lb/>
heavy and overwhelming cloud of affliction.</p>
<p>In the early spring of 1856, the scarlet fever, which <lb/>
had been prevalent in Carlisle, entered the Deanery, and <lb/>
in three short weeks the five little girls were swept away <lb/>
one by one by that terrible scourge&mdash;the eldest hardly <lb/>
ten, the youngest an infant of a year old. None were <lb/>
left but the only son, who was to be taken twenty-three <lb/>
years later, and the new born infant daughter.</p>
<p>One who was at Carlisle at the time, described the <lb/>
impression made on the whole congregation the Sunday <lb/>
after all was over, when the door of the once well-filled <lb/>
family pew was opened to admit the now sole occupant, <lb/>
the solitary little boy in deep mourning, with his sad <lb/>
young face, who came slowly in. There was scarcely a <lb/>
dry eye in the church.</p>
<p>"When the disease broke out, "her sister-in-law writes: <lb/>
"she &lpar;Mrs. Tait&rpar; rose from her couch, giving her new <lb/>
born infant, scarce a month old, into the hands of a <lb/>
young girl who was almost afraid to touch it &lpar;the regular <lb/>
nurse being busy among the sick&rpar;, and gave herself up <lb/>
<pb n="191" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0208"/>
to the ceaseless anxiety and toil of endeavouring to <lb/>
check the progress of the fever. Assured by the doctor, <lb/>
that with proper precautions the infant ran no risk by it, <lb/>
she came and went between the babe she was nursing <lb/>
and her dying children, sustaining them with prayer and <lb/>
helpful words of Scripture. Not an unsubmissive word <lb/>
was heard to escape her lips."</p>
<p>When the last of the little flock was taken, she <reg orig="re-|turned">returned</reg> <lb/>
from the service at the grave of her darling, to <lb/>
arrange, before leaving Carlisle, the affairs of the poor <lb/>
women whose subscriptions to the "mother's club" <lb/>
were in her keeping; she went through the accounts, <lb/>
placing the money for each to the proper name, so that <lb/>
there could be no mistake or loss, and then joined her <lb/>
husband and babe who were ready to start, and left the <lb/>
scene of their sorrow for a friend's house lent them in <lb/>
the quiet and beautiful scenery of the Lake country. <lb/>
From thence she wrote to a relative:</p>
<p>"God's will be done. We can and will praise Him. <lb/>
Often at night when I had hung over each little bed, I <lb/>
used to feel, 'This is too much for earth;' but as then <lb/>
I could bring my gladness to my Saviour's feet, so now <lb/>
I can lay my deep sorrow."</p>
<p>They never returned again to the Deanery to live, and <lb/>
the same year Dr. Tait was appointed to the Bishopric <lb/>
of London, and in the early part of 1857 they were <lb/>
installed in their new residence.</p>
<p>During the next three years the bereaved parents were <lb/>
cheered by the birth of two more daughters.</p>
<pb n="192" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0209"/>
<p>"When I remember," writes their mother, "as I do <lb/>
daily, those weeks of anguish, how strange it seems that <lb/>
our nursery should again be full of joy! Yet so it is."</p>
<p>She was now plunged into the midst of a life of more <lb/>
varied and overwhelming activities than ever she had yet <lb/>
known. "She never laid herself out in any way," her <lb/>
husband writes, "for what is called London society, but <lb/>
her position necessarily brought her into connection with <lb/>
many of its brightest ornaments. &hellip; She neither <lb/>
sought society nor avoided it; she enjoyed it when it <lb/>
came in her way quietly and calmly, and consistently <lb/>
with all the claims of important duty which were ever <lb/>
present to her mind."</p>
<p>At Fulham, she gathered together those who never <lb/>
met elsewhere, as on common ground. The afternoons <lb/>
under the old trees in the quiet garden were a resort of <lb/>
clergy, statesmen, literary men, and fellow-labourers in <lb/>
the works of charity in which she delighted.</p>
<p>And in her Christmas gatherings and garden parties <lb/>
she never forgot to extend hospitality to those who were <lb/>
the least likely to shine at them, but who would value <lb/>
the attention the most. A daily governess of her <lb/>
children was constantly asked, with her sisters and aged <lb/>
aunts, "thus brushing aside what often makes the life <lb/>
of a governess so lonely in a large household."</p>
<p>Though accustomed to abundant means in her first <lb/>
married homes, and in her later ones with large revenues <lb/>
at command, she exercised a vigilant control over their <lb/>
expenditure, never grudging what was spent on others, <lb/>
<pb n="193" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0210"/>
but most abstemious in all that concerned herself: "It <lb/>
seemed," her husband writes, "as if it would have made <lb/>
her positively unhappy that God should have bestowed <lb/>
on her so many common worldly blessings unless she <lb/>
had been able to share them with all who were brought <lb/>
within her influence."</p>
<p>In the midst of all these varied avocations, her <reg orig="atten-|tions">attentions</reg> <lb/>
to the poor, the sick and the aged, were <reg orig="uninter-|mitting">unintermitting</reg>. <lb/>
She continued to visit and teach as she had <lb/>
done at Carlisle and Rugby; and the desire she felt to <lb/>
draw together those who could work best in co-<reg orig="opera-|tion">operation</reg> <lb/>
with others, was what led to the formation of <lb/>
the "Ladies' Diocesan Association."</p>
<p>The object was to enlist in definite useful work many <lb/>
who were desirous of being employed and found a <lb/>
difficulty in starting work; and also to provide for the <lb/>
working of many districts where there were no residents <lb/>
able to help. Many ladies of rank and influence <reg orig="be-|came">became</reg> <lb/>
members, and devoted a portion of their time <lb/>
weekly to visiting the suffering and the fallen; and a <lb/>
fund was collected at the West End for distribution in <lb/>
the poorer quarters. Mrs. Tait visited each in turn, <lb/>
and assigned departments of usefulness to her young <lb/>
daughters, who visited each in company with an older <lb/>
friend.</p>
<p>In 1866, when the cholera broke out at the East <lb/>
End of London, Mrs. Tait, knowing that her presence <lb/>
would give courage to others, was continually to be seen <lb/>
in the large wards of the hospitals, quietly soothing the <lb/>
<pb n="194" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0211"/>
sufferers, and encouraging the ladies who were assisting <lb/>
the regular nurses.</p>
<p>This visitation led to the crowning work of her life, the <lb/>
establishment of an orphanage for some of the girls left <lb/>
destitute by the death of their parents from cholera.</p>
<p>A home was eventually built for the reception of these <lb/>
orphans, on a small private estate in the Isle of Thanet, <lb/>
which the bishop had purchased, to secure a sea-side <lb/>
home for himself and his family during his occasional <lb/>
absence from the press of London work.</p>
<p>In the end of 1868 he was appointed to the Primacy, <lb/>
and his wife entered on a new and still wider sphere of <lb/>
duties. She strove to continue at Lambeth, among rich <lb/>
and poor, the same occupations she had given herself <lb/>
at Fulham and London House, though on an extended <lb/>
scale. The country house attached to the see at <reg orig="Add-|ington">Addington</reg> <lb/>
was new and delightful to her, being the first <lb/>
fixed country residence she had known since the old <lb/>
days of the Warwickshire parsonage in her girlhood. <lb/>
But there was much work to be done at Lambeth. It <lb/>
was a much poorer neighbourhood than their former <lb/>
residences; and she and her children engaged in active <lb/>
visiting among the poor, and in the Lambeth Workhouse. <lb/>
A poor man who had been in the hospital there, said <lb/>
he could never think of Hebrews xii. without recalling <lb/>
the voice of Mrs. Tait reading it by his bedside.</p>
<p>The first stone of the Orphanage was laid after the <lb/>
Archbishop's recovery from a long and dangerous illness <lb/>
in 1869. It was on the 21st of December, a snowy, <lb/>
<pb n="195" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0212"/>
gusty day; but the aged Sir Moses Montefiore, in spite <lb/>
of the inclement weather, came over to show his interest <lb/>
in the work: he could not, of course, join in the <reg orig="open-|ing">opening</reg> <lb/>
service, but from his carriage he listened to it, and <lb/>
expressed his delight on hearing the Psalms chanted as <lb/>
the worshippers assembled on the ground. He <reg orig="con-|tinued">continued</reg> <lb/>
to subscribe to the institution, and to visit it <lb/>
frequently; and its foundress once met him there with <lb/>
the children gathered around him, to whom he had <lb/>
given each a new bright shilling from the Mint, and <lb/>
who were repeating to him a hymn of Dr. Watts, <lb/>
which he said he had learned in his childhood to say <lb/>
to his mother.</p>
<p>But a second heavy cloud, the last sorrow of her life, <lb/>
was now approaching. Her only son Crawford, the <lb/>
single survivor of the little band who had been swept <lb/>
away at Carlisle, was the sunshine of her latter years. <lb/>
He had been a boy full of promise, not from any peculiar <lb/>
precocity of talent or special aptitude for scholarship in <lb/>
early life, but from his modest, conscientious, and yet <lb/>
firm manly character, which made him both loved and <lb/>
respected among his companions at Eton and afterwards <lb/>
at Oxford. At college his mental powers developed <lb/>
rapidly; he took a first-class, competed for a <reg orig="fellow-|ship">fellowship</reg>, <lb/>
and finally resolved on entering Trinity. At his <lb/>
father's wish he visited Egypt and the Holy Land, with <lb/>
some friends, before being ordained, which he was in <lb/>
1874, to a curacy in a quiet and pretty village; but his <lb/>
desire for active work in his calling induced him to <lb/>
<pb n="196" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0213"/>
accept the charge of a poor district in the neighbourhood <lb/>
of Hythe, where he laboured with great zeal, organizing <lb/>
mission services, doing all he could for the good of the <lb/>
people.</p>
<p>When his own inner religious life first began does <lb/>
not very clearly appear. His mother often spoke of the <lb/>
fervour and deep feeling of his prayers with her in times <lb/>
of anxiety. He acted at one time as his father's <reg orig="chap-|lain">chaplain</reg>, <lb/>
and his help was described by his father as "<reg orig="in-|valuable">invaluable</reg>" <lb/>
both with the candidates for ordination and as <lb/>
pastor for the household of the palace.</p>
<p>For the sake of complete change after hard work, he <lb/>
made a visit of three months to America, which seems to <lb/>
have been one of much pleasure and deep interest to him.</p>
<p>On his return it was proposed he should take a very <lb/>
desirable living in his father's diocese; but he thought <lb/>
the place one of too much rest and ease for one in the <lb/>
prime of strength. He wished for hard work in London <lb/>
among the poor, and it ended in his exchanging with a <lb/>
hard-worked and wearied incumbent at Notting Hill, and <lb/>
engaging to take his place and leave the country living <lb/>
to him.</p>
<p>The appointment was made, but he never lived to <lb/>
avail himself of it. Symptoms of latent illness had <reg orig="ap-|peared">appeared</reg> <lb/>
soon after his return, against which he bore up <lb/>
for a time resolutely; but at his mother's earnest desire <lb/>
he at last took medical advice. Serious mischief was <reg orig="dis-|covered">discovered</reg>, <lb/>
and he was ordered complete rest. Thinking <lb/>
this would only be for a short time, he was inducted into <lb/>
<pb n="197" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0214"/>
his new ministerial charge in February, 1878. But he <lb/>
never appeared in his church again. Dangerous <reg orig="symp-|toms">symptoms</reg> <lb/>
declared themselves, and three months of trying <lb/>
illness followed.</p>
<p>His cheerful patience never failed, and its source was <lb/>
shown by the answer he made to a friend who, coming <lb/>
suddenly into his room, found him on his knees. "It <lb/>
doesn't matter at all," he replied, when the other <reg orig="apolo-|gised">apologised</reg>; <lb/>
"prayer is so much a part of one's life, that a <lb/>
little interruption of that sort makes no difference."</p>
<p>In May, 1878, he went to his father's house in the Isle <lb/>
of Thanet, in hopes of benefit from the sea air; but, <lb/>
three days later, a sudden change took place, and his <lb/>
father, at his own desire expressed beforehand, <reg orig="an-|nounced">announced</reg> <lb/>
to him that it was believed an hour or two must <lb/>
end his life. He was calm and peaceful, comforted <lb/>
his family, received the Lord's Supper with them, and <lb/>
with the words, "It feels just like going to sleep," <lb/>
passed away.</p>
<p>The mother, who had been his nurse and companion <lb/>
throughout, bore up with her usual firmness; she <lb/>
attended the funeral, and was heard, when it was over, to <lb/>
say to herself, in a low but thinking voice, "I believe in <lb/>
the resurrection of the dead." That belief was her <reg orig="sup-|port">support</reg>. <lb/>
She resumed her usual duties courageously, <lb/>
helped her husband in the arrangements for the great <lb/>
conference of English and American bishops, which was <lb/>
to take place at Lambeth, and accompanied her family <lb/>
to Switzerland when it was over.</p>
<pb n="198" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0215"/>
<p>But the death-stroke had been given. The wound <lb/>
was bravely hidden, but it was felt all the more keenly. <lb/>
"None but my God and myself," she said to one <lb/>
trusted friend, "knows what I have suffered."</p>
<p>She took an active part in the arrangements for her <lb/>
second daughter's marriage, which took place in the <lb/>
November of the same year, and then went with her <lb/>
husband and her two other daughters to Scotland. <lb/>
There, at one of the places she had visited and delighted <lb/>
in on her wedding tour &lpar;Garscube, the home of some <lb/>
near relatives&rpar;, she suddenly sickened with her last illness. <lb/>
It only lasted a few days. She received the communion, <lb/>
with her daughters, from her husband, listened to <lb/>
favourite hymns sung by the former, and when her <lb/>
husband tried to repeat to her, "Jesus, Lover of my soul," <lb/>
supplied the missing words of the familiar hymn when <lb/>
his voice failed; the same evening, Advent Sunday, <lb/>
1878, she expired, six months after her son's death.</p>
<p>The feeling manifested by all who knew her seems to <lb/>
have been universal. Many touching tributes came <lb/>
from old pupils in distant lands, and from old and new <lb/>
friends at home and abroad. One of the most touching <lb/>
was a letter from Princess Alice, slightly alluding to her <lb/>
own recent loss. It was the last letter that honoured <lb/>
and beloved princess ever wrote, and a fitting close to <lb/>
her self-forgetting life; her own death followed very <lb/>
quickly that of her whose bereaved husband she was <lb/>
trying to console in the midst of her own grief.</p>
<p>The memory of Catherine Tait's active, unselfish life <lb/>
<pb n="199" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0216"/>
of labour for others will not speedily be forgotten, and <lb/>
the example may well be an encouragement to those <lb/>
who desire to consecrate all their powers and <reg orig="oppor-|tunities">opportunities</reg> <lb/>
of usefulness to the service of their Maker and <lb/>
Redeemer.</p>

<p>From her earliest infancy Frances appears to have <lb/>
been a most attractive and promising child. Her eldest <lb/>
sister, Miriam, thus speakes of her in the valuable and <lb/>
interesting "Memorials" by Maria V. G. Havergal:&mdash;</p>
<p>"My recollections of Frances begins with the first day <lb/>
<pb n="201" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0218"/>
of her life; a pretty little babe even then, and by the <lb/>
time she reached two years of age, with her fair <reg orig="com-|plexion">complexion</reg>, <lb/>
light curling hair, and bright expression, a <lb/>
prettier child was seldom seen. At that age she spoke <lb/>
with perfect distinctness, and with greater fluency and <lb/>
greater variety of language than is usual in so young a <lb/>
child. She comprehended and enjoyed any little stories <lb/>
that were told her. I remember her animated look of <lb/>
attention when the Rev. J. East told her about a little <lb/>
Mary who loved the Lord Jesus. We were all taught <lb/>
to read early, and to repeat, by our dear mother; but <lb/>
as I had now left school I undertook this charming <lb/>
little pupil: teaching her reading, spelling, and a rhyme <lb/>
&lpar;generally one of Jane Taylor's&rpar;, for half an hour every <lb/>
morning, and in the afternoon twenty or thirty stitches <lb/>
of patchwork, with a very short text to repeat next <lb/>
morning at breakfast. When three years old, she could <lb/>
read easy books, and her brother Frank remembers how <lb/>
often she was found hiding under a table with some <lb/>
engrossing story."</p>
<p>When two years old she always sat on her father's <lb/>
knee while he read the Scriptures. She had a sweet <lb/>
infant voice while she sang little hymns in imitation of <lb/>
her father. At four years old she could read the Bible <lb/>
and any ordinary book correctly, and had learned to <lb/>
write in round hand. French and music were gradually <lb/>
added; but great care was taken not to tire her or excite <lb/>
the precocity of her mind, and she never had a regular <lb/>
governess.</p>
<pb n="202" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0219"/>
<p>The surroundings of the early days of Frances <reg orig="Haver-|gal">Havergal</reg> <lb/>
are thus poetically pictured by her sister Miriam:&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"Behold thy birthplace, Frances! The old house</l>
<l>Entwined with ivy, roses, and the vine;</l>
<l>Beneath the shadow of the ancient shrine</l>
<l>Where ministered our father twenty years</l>
<l>He built the northern aisle, and gave the clock,</l>
<l>A musical memento of his love</l>
<l>For time and tune and punctuality!</l>
<l>Fair is the garden ground, and there the flowers</l>
<l>Were trained with care and skill by <hi rend="italic">one</hi> who now</l>
<l>Rests from her labours in the heavenly land.</l>
<l>Here life and death together meet; the tombs</l>
<l>Stand close beside the mossy bank, where once</l>
<l>Sisters and brothers met in frolic play.</l>
<l>Around the wooded hills in beauty rise!</l>
<l>Earth has not many scenes more fair than this,</l>
<l>And none more dear to those who called it Home!"</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>We should here observe that Frances Havergal's father <lb/>
was a distinguished musical composer as well as a <reg orig="clergy-|man">clergyman</reg>. <lb/>
Her biographer says on this:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Our Sunday evening hymn-singing is vividly recalled, <lb/>
in which little Fanny soon took part. At this time our <lb/>
dear father was an invalid; music was his solace, and he <lb/>
composed cathedral services, also many hundreds of <lb/>
chants and tunes, and several sacred songs, the profits <lb/>
of which were always devoted to various societies, home <lb/>
and foreign, and the restoration of churches."</p>
<p>And then in a footnote she explains:&mdash;</p>
<p>"My father's first published musical composition was <lb/>
a setting of Bishop Heber's hymn, 'From Greenland's <lb/>
<pb n="203" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0220"/>
Icy Mountains!' The proceeds amounted to &pound;180, <lb/>
and were devoted to the Church Missionary Society. In <lb/>
1836 the Gresham prize medal was awarded to him for <lb/>
a cathedral service in A. In 1841 a second gold medal <lb/>
was adjudged for his anthem, 'Give thanks.'"</p>
<p>But her home appears to have been full of other rich <lb/>
and holy influences besides the one of music.</p>
<p>"The meaning of song goes deep," says Carlyle. <lb/>
"Who is there that in logical words can express the <lb/>
effect music has on us! A kind of inarticulate, <reg orig="unfathom-|able">unfathomable</reg> <lb/>
speech, which leads us to the edge of the infinite, <lb/>
and lets us for a moment gaze into that!"</p>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"Of all the arts beneath the heaven</l>
<l>That man has found or God has given,</l>
<l>None draws the soul so sweet away,</l>
<l>As music's melting, mystic lay;</l>
<l>Slight emblem of the bliss above,</l>
<l>It soothes the spirit all to love."</l>
</lg></q>
<p>So we find that Miss Havergal was reared in a home <lb/>
of music as well as devotion, and its divine influence <lb/>
amply showed itself throughout her long life.</p>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"Amid the golden gifts which Heaven</l>
<l>Has left, like portions of its light on earth,</l>
<l>None hath such influence as music hath.</l>
<l>The painter's hues stand visible before us</l>
<l>In power and beauty&mdash;we can trace the thoughts</l>
<l>Which are the workings of the poet's mind;</l>
<l>But music is a mystery, and viewless,</l>
<l>Even when present, and is less man's act,</l>
<l>And less within his order; for the hand</l>
<pb n="204" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0221"/>
<l>That can call forth the tones, yet cannot tell</l>
<l>Whither they go, or if they live or die,</l>
<l>When floated once beyond his feeble ear;</l>
<l>And then, as if it were an unreal thing,</l>
<l>The wind will sweep from the neglected strings</l>
<l>As rich a swell as ever minstrel drew."</l>
</lg></q>
<p>But all the influence music had on Miss Havergal she <lb/>
gave to Heaven. All her numerous hymns and musical <lb/>
compositions were in the service of religion; and no <lb/>
modern religious poet has made so deep an impression <lb/>
as she has done. She early "lisp'd in numbers," for at <lb/>
the age of seven she composed the following pretty <lb/>
verses:&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="stanza">
<l>"Sunday is a pleasant day,</l>
<l rend="indent">When we to church do go;</l>
<l>For there we sing, and read, and pray,</l>
<l rend="indent">And hear the sermon too.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>On Sunday hear the village bells;</l>
<l rend="indent">It seems as if they said,</l>
<l>Go to the church where the pastor tells</l>
<l rend="indent">How Christ for man has bled.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>And if we live to pray and read</l>
<l rend="indent">While we are in our youth,</l>
<l>The Lord will help us in our need</l>
<l rend="indent">And keep us in His truth."</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>From nine years old and upwards she wrote long <lb/>
and amusingly descriptive letters in perfect rhyme and <lb/>
rhythm.</p>
<p>From her Autobiography, written, we are told, for her <lb/>
sister Maria, and unsealed only a few months ago, she <lb/>
says:&mdash;</p>
<pb n="205" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0222"/>
<p>"Up to the time that I was six years old I have no <lb/>
remembrance of any religious ideas whatever. Even <lb/>
when once taken to see the corpse of a little boy of my <lb/>
own age &lpar;four years&rpar;, lying in a coffin strewn with flowers, <lb/>
in dear papa's parish of Astley, I did not think about it <lb/>
as otherwise than a very sad and very curious thing, <lb/>
that that little child should be so still and cold. I do <lb/>
not think I could ever have said any of those 'pretty <lb/>
things' that little children often do, though there were <lb/>
sweet and beloved and holy ones round me who must <lb/>
have often tried to put good thoughts into my little mind. <lb/>
But from six to eight I recall a different state of things. <lb/>
The beginning of it was a sermon preached one Sunday <lb/>
morning, at Hallow Church, by Mr. &lpar;now Archdeacon&rpar; <lb/>
Phillpotts. Of this I even now retain a distinct <reg orig="im-|pression">impression</reg>. <lb/>
It was to me a very terrible one, dwelling <lb/>
much on hell and judgment, and what a fearful thing it <lb/>
is to fall into the hands of the living God. No one ever <lb/>
knew it, but this sermon haunted me, and day and night <lb/>
it crossed me. I began to pray a good deal, though <lb/>
only night and morning, with a sort of fidget and <reg orig="im-|patience">impatience</reg>, <lb/>
almost angry at feeling so unhappy, and wanting <lb/>
and expecting to get a new heart, and have everything <lb/>
put straight, and be made happy all at once.</p>
<p>"This sort of thing went on at intervals, not at all <lb/>
continually, for often a month or two would pass without <lb/>
a serious thought or anything like true prayer. At such <lb/>
times I utterly abominated being 'talked to,' would do <lb/>
anything on earth to escape the kindly meant <reg orig="admo-|nitions">admonitions</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="206" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0223"/>
of dear M<gap desc="long dash" reason="missing" id="g8"/>, or the prayers which she would <lb/>
offer for me. Any cut or bruise &lpar;and such were more <lb/>
the rule than exception in those wild days of <reg orig="tree-|climbing">tree-climbing</reg>, <lb/>
wall-scaling, etc.&rpar; was instantly adduced as a <lb/>
reason why I could not possibly kneel down. A chapter <lb/>
in the Bible was often a terrible bore. Then after a time <lb/>
of this sort, some mere trifle, very often the influence of <lb/>
a calm, beautiful evening, or perhaps a 'Sunday book' <lb/>
of some affecting kind, would rouse me up to <reg orig="uncom-|fortableness">uncomfortableness</reg> <lb/>
again. One sort of habit I got into in a <lb/>
steady way, which was persevered in with more or less <lb/>
fervour according to the particular fit in which I might <lb/>
be. Every Sunday afternoon I went alone into a little <lb/>
front room &lpar;at Henwick&rpar; over the hall, and there I used <lb/>
to read a chapter in the Testament, and then knelt down <lb/>
and prayed for a few minutes, after which I usually felt <lb/>
soothed and less naughty. Once when Marian P. was <lb/>
spending a few days with me, she being my own little <lb/>
visitor at Henwick, I did not like any omission, and so <lb/>
took her with me, saying a few words of prayer, 'out of <lb/>
my head,' without any embarrassment at her presence.</p>
<p>"I think I had a far more vivid sense of the beauty <lb/>
of nature as a little child than I have even now; and its <lb/>
power over me was greater than any one would imagine. <lb/>
I have hardly felt anything so intensely since in the way <lb/>
of a sort of unbearable enjoyment. Especially, and I <lb/>
think more than anything else, the golden quiet of a <lb/>
bright summer's day used to enter into me and do me <lb/>
good. What only some great and rare musical <reg orig="enjoy-|ment">enjoyment</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="207" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0224"/>
is to me now, the shade of a tree under a clear <lb/>
blue sky, with a sunbeam glancing through the boughs, <lb/>
was to me then. But I did not feel happy in my very <lb/>
enjoyment; I wanted <hi rend="italic">more</hi>. I do not think I was eight <lb/>
when I hit upon Cowper's lines, ending&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>'My Father made them all!'</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>"That was what I wanted to be able to say; and, <lb/>
after once seeing the words, I never saw a lovely scene <lb/>
again without being <hi rend="italic">teased</hi> by them. One spring &lpar;I <lb/>
think 1845&rpar; I kept thinking of them, and a dozen times <lb/>
a day said to myself, 'Oh, if God would but make me <lb/>
a Christian before the summer comes!' because I <lb/>
longed so to enjoy His works as I felt they could be <lb/>
enjoyed. And I could not bear to think of <hi rend="italic">another</hi> <lb/>
summer coming and going, and finding and leaving me <lb/>
still 'not a Christian.' I shall know some day <hi rend="italic">why</hi> my <lb/>
Father left me to walk thus alone in my early <reg orig="child-|hood">childhood</reg>, <lb/>
why such long years of dissatisfaction and <reg orig="rest-|lessness">restlessness</reg> <lb/>
were apportioned me, while others fancied me <lb/>
a happy, thoughtless child. But He must have been <lb/>
teaching me, and 'who teacheth like Him?' Another <lb/>
soothing influence over me was the presence of any one <lb/>
whom I believed to be more than commonly holy; not <lb/>
among those nearest and dearest to me at home; how <lb/>
perversely I overlooked <hi rend="italic">them!</hi> but any very pious <lb/>
clergyman, or other manifest and shining Christian.</p>
<p>"All this while I don't think any one could have given <lb/>
the remotest guess at what passed in my mind, or have <lb/>
<pb n="208" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0225"/>
given me credit for a single serious thought. I <hi rend="italic">knew</hi> I <lb/>
was a 'naughty child,' never entertained any doubts on <lb/>
the subject; in fact, I almost enjoyed my naughtiness <lb/>
in a savage, desperate kind of way, because I utterly <lb/>
despaired of getting any better, except by being 'made <lb/>
a Christian,' which, as months passed on, leaving me <lb/>
rather worse than better, was a less and less hoped for, <lb/>
though more and more <hi rend="italic">longed</hi> for, change. Towards the <lb/>
end of these two years, I think &lpar;though I do not <reg orig="dis-|tinctly">distinctly</reg> <lb/>
remember&rpar; that I must have become a shade <lb/>
quieter and happier, because of what is the first memory <lb/>
in my next little soul era."</p>
<p>She here relates the powerful effect a sermon <lb/>
preached by her father's curate, "Fear not, little flock," <lb/>
etc., had on her, and she became so uneasy that, after <lb/>
a fortnight's hesitation, she took the opportunity of <lb/>
being alone with the curate one evening when nearly <lb/>
dark, to tell him the trouble of her mind. His advice, <lb/>
she says, did not satisfy her; "she was to try and be a <lb/>
good girl, and pray," etc., etc.</p>
<p>"So, after that," she continues in her autobiography, <lb/>
"my lips were utterly sealed to all but God for another <lb/>
five years or rather more. Even when feeling most, I <lb/>
fancied I could as soon speak Sanscrit, or die, as utter <lb/>
a word to a human being on what was only between <lb/>
me and God.</p>
<p>"My dear mamma's illness and death &lpar;July 5th, 1848&rpar; <lb/>
did not make the impression on me which might have <lb/>
been expected; I mean as regards my spiritual state; <lb/>
<pb n="209" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0226"/>
for my intense sorrow, childish though it was, seems <lb/>
even now, after a lapse of eleven years, a thing of which <lb/>
I do not like to speak or think. A mother's death must <lb/>
be childhood's greatest grief. But I am trying now to <lb/>
write only of my soul's life. I did not at all expect her <lb/>
departure, and shut my ears in a very hardened way <lb/>
to those who tried to prepare me for it; so when it <lb/>
came I was not ready, and there was nothing but <reg orig="bitter-|ness">bitterness</reg> <lb/>
in it to me. I did not, <hi rend="italic">would</hi> not, see God's <lb/>
hand in it, and the stroke left me worse than it found <lb/>
me."</p>
<p>Here, in her sister's charming volume of "<reg orig="Memo-|rials">Memorials</reg>" <lb/>
&lpar;Nisbet &amp; Co.&rpar;, occurs the following brief <reg orig="conver-|sation">conversation</reg> <lb/>
between Frances and her dying mother:&mdash;</p>
<p>"'You are my youngest little girl, and I feel more <lb/>
anxious about you than the rest. I do pray for the <lb/>
Holy Spirit to lead you and guide you. And <reg orig="remem-|ber">remember</reg>, <lb/>
nothing but the precious blood of Christ can make <lb/>
you clean and lovely in God's sight.'</p>
<p>"'Oh, mamma, I am sure you will get better and go <lb/>
to church again!'</p>
<p>"'No, dear child; the church mamma is going to is <lb/>
the general assembly and church of the firstborn in <lb/>
heaven. How glorious to know I shall soon see my <lb/>
Saviour face to face! Now go and play and sing some <lb/>
of your little hymns for me; there is one verse I should <lb/>
like you to sing twice over,&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"And when her path is darkened,</l>
<l rend="indent">She lifts her trusting eye,</l>
<pb n="210" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0227"/>
<l>And says, 'My Father calls me</l>
<l rend="indent">To mansions in the sky!'"</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>"Before her mother's death &lpar;when she was eleven <lb/>
years old&rpar; her wish was gratified to see the Lord's <lb/>
Supper administered. We remember her grave, flushed <lb/>
face, when kneeling at her mother's bed during the <lb/>
'Communion of the Sick.'"</p>
<p>Very touching is the following as the little Frances <lb/>
gazed upon her dear mother's funeral from her father's <lb/>
rectory window:&mdash;</p>
<p>"She was standing by the window in a front room, <lb/>
looking through a little space between the window and <lb/>
blind. All the shops were shut up, though it was not <lb/>
Sunday. She knew it would be dreadful to look out <lb/>
of that window, and yet she felt she <hi rend="italic">must</hi> look. She <lb/>
did not cry, she only stood and shivered in the warm <lb/>
air.</p>
<p>"Very slowly and quietly a funeral passed out of the <lb/>
front &lsqb;rectory&rsqb; gate, and in another minute was out of <lb/>
sight, turning into the church. Then she stood no <lb/>
longer, but rushed away to her own little room, and <lb/>
flung herself on her little bed, and cried, 'Oh, mamma! <lb/>
mamma! mamma!' It seemed as if there was nothing <lb/>
else in her little head but that one word. The strange <lb/>
hope which had lasted all that week was gone. She <lb/>
had found curious things in books, and one was that <lb/>
people had sometimes been supposed to be dead, and yet <lb/>
it was only a trance, and they had recovered. And so, <lb/>
when no one was near, she had gone again and again <lb/>
<pb n="211" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0228"/>
into that room, and drawn the curtain aside, half <reg orig="ex-|pecting">expecting</reg> <lb/>
to see the dear eyes unclose, and to feel the <lb/>
cold cheek warm again to her kiss. But it was no <lb/>
trance. The dear, suffering mother was at rest, seeing <lb/>
Jesus face to face. Only the smile of holy peace was <lb/>
left on that lovely face, and that remained to the last, <lb/>
telling of life beyond death; she had never seen the <lb/>
solemn beauty of that smile before. But now all hope <lb/>
was gone, and she knew that she was motherless.</p>
<p>"Though her grief for her dear mother's death was <lb/>
very deep, she ever tried to conceal it. Not that it was <lb/>
always heavy upon her, for as she writes: 'If anything <lb/>
else occupied my attention, I had a happy faculty of <lb/>
forgetting everything else for the moment. And thus <lb/>
it happened that a merry laugh or a sudden light-heeled <lb/>
scamper upstairs and downstairs led others to think I <lb/>
had not many sad thoughts, whereas not a minute before <lb/>
my little heart was heavy and sad.'"</p>
<p>We now come to her school-life, which was an episode <lb/>
in her life marked with many good effects. We quote <lb/>
from her autobiography: "The bells were ringing in the <lb/>
new year, and not <hi rend="italic">year</hi> only but <hi rend="italic">decade</hi>, when Maria woke <lb/>
me and said, 'It is 1850 now, Fanny!' It was quite <lb/>
dark, and I lay listening to the new year's birth-song in <lb/>
silence. A dim looking onward through a fresh 'ten <lb/>
years,' all the way till 1860 came before me; I should <lb/>
be grown up if I lived; I a woman, how curious it <lb/>
seemed! Perhaps I should be dead, and&mdash;where? If I <lb/>
lived, should I be a Christian? That was the greatest <lb/>
<pb n="212" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0229"/>
thing in all my anticipations of coming years; but in a <lb/>
solemn hour, like a new year's midnight, it grew greater <lb/>
and more important than ever. The sound of the bells <lb/>
died away, and all was quiet again. I did not muse <lb/>
long, but fell asleep to wake up in the fresh grey <lb/>
twilight of 1850.</p>
<p>"Now the decade has nearly glided by &lpar;the first <lb/>
entire one in my recollection&rpar;; the new year's bells <lb/>
of 1860 will soon be sounding forth; God has preserved <lb/>
my life hitherto; and how shall I answer the great <lb/>
question then, not 'shall I be,' but 'am I a Christian?'</p>
<p>"August 15th, 1850, to my great delight I went to <lb/>
school. And that single half-year with dear Mrs. Teed <lb/>
was perhaps the most important to me of any in my <lb/>
life. The night before I went, Ellen&mdash;dear, gentle, <lb/>
heavenly sister that she was&mdash;stood by me, brushing my <lb/>
hair, and taking the last opportunity of loving counsel. <lb/>
She told me that I was going to begin a new chapter <lb/>
in my life; stay, her words were, 'One of the great <lb/>
events of your life, Fanny!' and then she was silent. I <lb/>
was captiously disposed, and rather wanted to avoid a <lb/>
serious conversation, so I answered carelessly, for I <lb/>
knew by the tone of her voice what she wanted to <lb/>
lead on to. But it would not do, she went on till I <lb/>
was softened&mdash;a most unusual thing under the process <lb/>
of being talked to, which generally had the most <reg orig="op-|posite">opposite</reg> <lb/>
effect. She spoke of God's love, and of how <lb/>
pleasant and sweet a thing it was to love Him who <lb/>
first loved us. I could not stand it, and for the first <lb/>
<pb n="213" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0230"/>
time for five years I spoke out: 'I can't love God yet, <lb/>
Nellie!' was all I said, but I felt a great deal more.</p>
<p>"Next day I went. Maria took me, and we reached <lb/>
Belmont quite in the evening. It was nearly <reg orig="prayer-|time">prayer-time</reg>, <lb/>
and Maria and I were left to have some tea alone <lb/>
in the great drawing-room. We had just finished when <lb/>
voices reached us, and we tried to find our way in their <lb/>
direction. They came from the schoolroom, where the <lb/>
girls were singing their evening hymn prior to the <lb/>
weekly address of their chaplain. It sounded very <lb/>
sweet and soothing, as we stood behind the door in <lb/>
the last glow of sunset, and somewhat subdued the <lb/>
spirits and the curiosity which were exciting me <reg orig="con-|siderably">considerably</reg>. <lb/>
Then Miss Teed came out and brought us <lb/>
in, just as Mr. Parker was beginning his sermon."</p>
<p>The school at Belmont appears to have been presided <lb/>
over by a devout mistress, and her religious teachings <lb/>
had a marked effect on her pupils, Frances Havergal <lb/>
not excepted.</p>
<p>"November came, and with it a marked increase of <lb/>
anxiety among undecided, and earnestness among <reg orig="de-|cided">decided</reg> <lb/>
ones &lsqb;her schoolfellows&rsqb;. I remember a feeling <lb/>
of awe stealing over me sometimes, at the consciousness <lb/>
that the 'power of the Lord was present' among us. <lb/>
For so indeed it was. As day after day passed on, <lb/>
one after another might be observed &lpar;even though little <lb/>
or nothing were said&rpar; to be going through the great <lb/>
sorrow which seemed to prelude the after-sent peace; <lb/>
and day after day one after another, hitherto silent, <lb/>
<pb n="214" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0231"/>
spoke out and told what peace and joy in believing <lb/>
they had found, and blessed God that they ever came <lb/>
to Belmont. Religious topics became the common <lb/>
subjects of conversation among the girls; for even <lb/>
those as yet untouched could not but be struck with <lb/>
what passed around them. In very general conversation <lb/>
I occasionally joined, but more reservedly than any <lb/>
almost, and never alluding to my own feelings, though <lb/>
I knew what it was for my heart to feel as if it must <lb/>
burst. I am not quite sure, but I think, when <reg orig="Eliza-|beth">Elizabeth</reg> <lb/>
<gap desc="long dash" reason="missing" id="g9"/> told me that she too had found peace, I told <lb/>
her enough of my heart to establish confidence between <lb/>
us.</p>
<p>"As I heard of one and another speaking in such <lb/>
terms of confidence and gladness, my heart seemed to <lb/>
sink within me, it seemed so utterly unattainable. I <lb/>
prayed despairingly, as a drowning man cries for help <lb/>
who sees no help near. I had prayed and sought so <lb/>
long, and yet I was farther off than these girls, many <lb/>
of whom had only begun to think of religion a few <lb/>
weeks before. It was so very dark around me; I could <lb/>
not see Jesus in the storm, nor hear His voice. They <lb/>
spoke of His power and willingness to save, but I could <lb/>
find nothing to prove that He was willing to save <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, <lb/>
and I wanted some special personal evidence about it. <lb/>
To <hi rend="italic">know</hi>, surely, that my sins were forgiven, and to have <lb/>
all my doubts taken away, was what I prayed and waited <lb/>
for. Every day as it passed, while more were added <lb/>
to the rejoicing ones around me, only left me more <lb/>
<pb n="215" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0232"/>
hopeless, more heartsick at the hope deferred and often <lb/>
almost lost.</p>
<p>"Yet I drank in every word &lpar;and they were many&rpar; <lb/>
that I heard about Jesus and His salvation. I came <lb/>
to see that it was Christ <hi rend="italic">alone</hi> that could satisfy me. I <lb/>
longed <hi rend="italic">intensely</hi> to come to Him, I wept and prayed day <lb/>
and night; but 'there was no voice, nor any that <reg orig="an-|swered">answered</reg>.'"</p>
<p>In her autobiography, dated February, 1851, we find <lb/>
her religious convictions made more of a source of <lb/>
comfort and solace to her, as thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I feel that the beginning of this year ought to be <lb/>
marked as the commencement of a new life-chapter, <lb/>
because it was then that, for the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> time, I ever knew <lb/>
what it was to have one gleam of hope or trust in <lb/>
Christ, or one spark of conscious faith. Not that I <lb/>
would date conversion exactly from this time; that I <lb/>
cannot fix. The <hi rend="italic">time</hi> I know not, the <hi rend="italic">fact</hi> I would <lb/>
desire to 'make sure' more and more.</p>
<p>"Having broken the ice by speaking on sacred things <lb/>
with a few at Belmont, it was the less difficult to do so <lb/>
again; and before long I had made a confidante of <lb/>
Miss Cooke &lpar;who afterwards became my loved mother&rpar;. <lb/>
I think it must have been in February, when she was <lb/>
visiting at Bathampton at the same time with me, and <lb/>
had several conversations with me, each of which made <lb/>
me more earnest and hopeful. At last, one evening <lb/>
&lpar;I remember it was twilight&rpar; I sat on the drawing-room <lb/>
sofa alone with her, and told her again how I longed <lb/>
<pb n="216" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0233"/>
to know that I was forgiven. She asked me a question <lb/>
which led to the hearty answer that I was sure I desired <lb/>
it above everything on earth, that even my precious <lb/>
papa was nothing in comparison&mdash;brothers and sisters, <lb/>
and all I loved, I could lose everything were it but to <lb/>
attain this. She paused, and then said slowly: 'Then, <lb/>
Fanny, I think, <hi rend="italic">I am sure</hi>, it will not be very long before <lb/>
your desire is granted, your hope fulfilled.' After a few <lb/>
words she said: 'Why cannot you trust yourself to <lb/>
your Saviour at once? Supposing that now, at this <lb/>
moment, Christ were to come in the clouds of heaven, <lb/>
and take up His redeemed, could you not trust Him? <lb/>
Would not His call, His promise, be enough for you? <lb/>
Could not you commit your soul to Him, to your <lb/>
Saviour, Jesus?' Then came a flash of hope across <lb/>
me, which made me feel literally breathless. I remember <lb/>
how my heart beat. 'I <hi rend="italic">could</hi>, surely,' was my response; <lb/>
and I left her suddenly and ran away upstairs to think <lb/>
it out. I flung myself on my knees in my room, and <lb/>
strove to realize the sudden hope. I was very happy at <lb/>
last. I could commit my soul to Jesus; I did not, and <lb/>
need not, fear His coming. I could trust Him with my <lb/>
all for eternity. It was so utterly new to have any <lb/>
bright thoughts about religion, that I could hardly <reg orig="be-|lieve">believe</reg> <lb/>
it could be so, that I had really gained such a <lb/>
step. Then and there I committed my soul to the <lb/>
Saviour, I do not mean to say without <hi rend="italic">any</hi> trembling or <lb/>
fear, but I did&mdash;and earth and heaven seemed bright <lb/>
from that moment&mdash;<hi rend="italic">I did trust in the Lord Jesus</hi>."</p>
<pb n="217" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0234"/>
<p>Great indeed must have been the joy at being at <lb/>
once and for ever relieved of all doubts and terrors, <lb/>
and finding herself amongst the redeemed! As we <lb/>
have seen, she had gone through a "reign of terror," <lb/>
but had at last found a safe and sure anchorage in the <lb/>
name of Jesus, and the revelation of Himself to <reg orig="man-|kind">mankind</reg>. <lb/>
She goes on to narrate:&mdash;</p>
<p>"For the next few days my happiness continued. <lb/>
Over and over again I renewed that giving up my soul <lb/>
to the Saviour which had made entrance for the joy. <lb/>
For the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> time my Bible was <hi rend="italic">sweet</hi> to me, and the <lb/>
first passage which I distinctly remember reading, in a <lb/>
new and glad light, was the fourteenth and following <lb/>
chapters of St. John's Gospel. We went to Bewdley in <lb/>
the large carriage, and I rode outside, so had no <reg orig="con-|versation">conversation</reg> <lb/>
to disturb me. In coming home I took out <lb/>
a little Testament from my pocket, and read those <lb/>
beautiful chapters, feeling how wondrously loving and <lb/>
tender they were, and that now I too might share in <lb/>
their beauty and comfort."</p>
<p>In July, 1851, her father married Caroline Ann, <lb/>
daughter of John Cooke, Esq., of Gloucester. One of <lb/>
Frances' poetical letters tells how in 1852 she <reg orig="accom-|panied">accompanied</reg> <lb/>
her parents to Germany, where her father went to <lb/>
consult a renowned oculist concerning the state of his <reg orig="eye-|sight">eyesight</reg>, <lb/>
which was found to be incipient cataract. From <lb/>
Germany she sent many interesting letters &lpar;published in <lb/>
the "Memorials"&rpar; to Elizabeth Clay, her schoolfellow <lb/>
and life-long correspondent. We will submit one of these <lb/>
<pb n="218" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0235"/>
letters out of the many which opens up to us her <lb/>
intellectual life. It is dated from Obercassel, 1853, and <lb/>
runs thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>"You will want to know, dear Elizabeth, what brings <lb/>
me here. Dear papa's eyes have been lately quite at a <lb/>
standstill as to improvement. He is now with mamma <lb/>
at Heidelberg, leaving me under the care of a good <lb/>
pastor and his wife. Obercassel is a pleasant village on <lb/>
the Rhine. We see the Drachenfels, with a peep into <lb/>
a narrow rock-shut-in valley, through which the Rhine <lb/>
flows from Coblenz. That you may glance into my <lb/>
room, I send herewith a Raphaelistic sketch thereof! <lb/>
Busts of Goethe and Schiller, shelves and table covered <lb/>
with German and French books, etc., etc. It will soon <lb/>
be dark, and then I go down and take my place by the <lb/>
Pastor Schulze-Berge, who will read aloud, while the <lb/>
pleasant frau pastorin and Lottchen work or knit. <reg orig="Con-|versational">Conversational</reg> <lb/>
interruptions, serious or amusing, will take <lb/>
their turn; and Goethe, whose life is the subject, will <lb/>
be criticised in every light. Now, is not this very <lb/>
pleasant? I like my quarters amazingly, and am very <lb/>
happy. I get up at five o'clock, breakfast at seven; <lb/>
then I study for four hours. Of course my books are <lb/>
nearly all German, and I write abstracts; I also give <lb/>
one hour to French literature. How I do enjoy myself <lb/>
when I get to the German poets and universal history, <lb/>
which I dive into with avidity. If anything strikes me, <lb/>
I can always refer to the good pastor.</p>
<p>"I have opportunities here of seeing a little of <lb/>
<pb n="219" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0236"/>
German high life. Close by is the 'court' of the <lb/>
Count von Lippe, a family worthy of their rank and <lb/>
title. They live very simply, because they give more <lb/>
than half their income away. The dowager countess <lb/>
is a perfect pattern of a Christian noble lady, also her <lb/>
gentle suffering daughter Mathilde. Then there is an <lb/>
adopted daughter, Fraulein von Clondt, whom I like <lb/>
very much. To her I go now regularly from nine to ten <lb/>
a.m., to read some German author, which is very nice <lb/>
for me, and very kind of her. Besides that, I am <reg orig="con-|stantly">constantly</reg> <lb/>
invited there to tea or for some excursions, so <lb/>
that I see many of the German aristocracy, who are <lb/>
often there. One of the countess's daughters is a <reg orig="prin-|cess">princess</reg>; <lb/>
I should like her to come while I am here, as I <lb/>
have never spoken to a princess in my life! I am often <lb/>
on the Rhine, and I always row a little, it's such <lb/>
fun! &hellip; The German language is very easy to <lb/>
me, for except on Sundays, which I spend with the <lb/>
English clergyman of D&uuml;sseldorf, I never hear or speak <lb/>
English. It is most absurd now when I begin to speak <lb/>
English; I cannot get to think in it, and keep <reg orig="trans-|lating">translating</reg> <lb/>
German expressions which seem so much more <lb/>
natural to me to use."</p>
<p>As to her student-life in Germany, the following letter <lb/>
&lpar;written after the sad news of her death&rpar;, from Pastor <lb/>
Schulze-Berge to her sister biographer, will interestingly <lb/>
show her aptitude and earnestness. The letter is dated <lb/>
September 24th, 1879:&mdash;</p>
<p>"It is a joy to me to give you some information about <lb/>
<pb n="220" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0237"/>
your beloved sister Frances' progress in those studies <lb/>
in which I had the privilege of being her instructor. <lb/>
I had the greatest esteem for her while she was in our <lb/>
house, which only deepened each time I saw her again <lb/>
or heard of her work. She was committed to my care <lb/>
for her studies in 1853, at Obercassel. I instructed her <lb/>
in German composition, literature, and history; I learned <lb/>
to appreciate her rich talents and mental powers, so <lb/>
that the lessons were more pleasure than work! She <lb/>
showed from the first such application, such rare talent, <lb/>
such depth of comprehension, that I can only speak of <lb/>
her progress as extraordinary. She acquired such a <lb/>
knowledge of our most celebrated authors in a short <lb/>
time, as even German ladies attain only after much <lb/>
study. They were precious moments when I unfolded <lb/>
to her the character of one of our noblest poets and <lb/>
thinkers, and let her have a glimpse into the splendour <lb/>
of his works. Stirred to the depths of her soul, she <lb/>
burst out enthusiastically: 'Oh, what mental giants, <lb/>
what gifted men, these Germans are!' What imprinted <lb/>
the stamp of nobility upon her whole being, and <reg orig="in-|fluenced">influenced</reg> <lb/>
all her opinions, was her true piety, and the <lb/>
deep reverence she had for her Lord and Saviour, <lb/>
whose example penetrated her young life through and <lb/>
through. Seldom have I been more touched than by the <lb/>
news of her early 'going home,' but she is with Him to <lb/>
whom her soul belonged, her Lord."</p>
<p>On July 17th, 1854, she was confirmed in Worcester <lb/>
Cathedral by the bishop, and she relates, "My feelings <lb/>
<pb n="221" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0238"/>
when the bishop's hands were placed on my head I <lb/>
cannot describe, they were too confused; but when the <lb/>
words 'Defend, O Lord, this Thy child with Thy <lb/>
heavenly grace, that she may continue Thine for ever, <lb/>
and daily increase in Thy Holy Spirit more and more, <lb/>
until she come unto Thy everlasting kingdom,' if ever <lb/>
my heart followed a prayer it did then, if ever it thrilled <lb/>
with earnest longing not unmixed with joy, it did at the <lb/>
words 'Thine for ever.'"</p>
<p>Subsequently, in her manuscript book of poetry, she <lb/>
wrote: <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<head>"<hi rend="small-caps">Thine for Ever</hi>."</head>
<l>Oh! "Thine for ever," what a blessed thing</l>
<l rend="indent">To be for ever His who died for me!</l>
<l>My Saviour, all my life Thy praise I'll sing,</l>
<l rend="indent">Nor cease my song throughout eternity.</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>She always kept the anniversary of her confirmation <lb/>
day. So lately as 1876 and 1877 she seems to have <lb/>
renewed her confirmation vow, in the following verses,&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="stanza">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">A Covenant.</hi></head>
<l>Now, Lord, I give myself to Thee,</l>
<l rend="indent">I would be wholly Thine;</l>
<l>As Thou hast given Thyself to me,</l>
<l rend="indent">And Thou art wholly mine;</l>
<l>Oh, take me, seal me as Thine own,</l>
<l rend="indent">Thine altogether&mdash;Thine alone.</l>
<l rend="indent2">&lpar;<hi rend="italic">July, 1876</hi>.&rpar;</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>Only for Jesus! Lord keep it for ever</l>
<l rend="indent">Sealed on the heart and engraved on the life!</l>
<pb n="222" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0239"/>
<l>Pulse of all gladness, and nerve of endeavour,</l>
<l rend="indent">Secret of rest, and the strength of our strife!</l>
<l rend="indent2">&lpar;<hi rend="italic">July, 1877.</hi>&rpar;</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>After her confirmation she carefully kept up all her <lb/>
studies, her abstracts in German, French, and English <lb/>
showing the rapidity and variety of her reading. With <lb/>
her father's help she acquired sufficient knowledge of <lb/>
Greek to enjoy studying the New Testament.</p>
<p>"Our dear father," says Maria Havergal in the "<reg orig="Me-|morials">Memorials</reg>" <lb/>
of her beloved sister Frances, "had again been <lb/>
to Gr&auml;frath in 1855, and returned with his eyesight much <lb/>
better." On this event Frances very affectionately <lb/>
writes:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Is not this glorious! Such sudden improvement we <lb/>
hardly dared to hope for. We shall see papa in the <lb/>
reading desk on Sunday, where he has not been for <lb/>
nearly four years! Oh, we are so happy. Papa and <lb/>
mamma came home on Saturday. We welcomed them <lb/>
in style. I made a triumphal arch over the hall-door <lb/>
with flowers and greenery, over the study door papa's <lb/>
crest in flowers, and over the dining-room a banner with <lb/>
the words in rosebuds and leaves, 'Welcome Home.' <lb/>
Oh, it was so nice that dear papa was able to <hi rend="italic">see</hi> it; <lb/>
directly he came he knelt down with us all, and offered <lb/>
such beautiful prayer or rather praise!"</p>
<p>Frances Havergal's sister says "her Sunday-school <lb/>
work was a loved employment. In the neatly kept <lb/>
register, entitled 'My Sunday Scholars, from 1846 to <lb/>
1860,' each child's birthday, entrance date, occurrences <lb/>
<pb n="223" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0240"/>
in their home, general impressions of their character, and <lb/>
subsequent events in their life, are all carefully noted."</p>
<p>From her Sunday-school Register we quote the last <lb/>
page, showing how earnestly and lovingly, how devotedly <lb/>
she was given to this important task:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Among all my St. Nicholas memories, none will be <lb/>
fonder or deeper than my class. I cannot tell any one <lb/>
how I loved them, I should hardly be believed; no one <lb/>
in the parish, either rich or poor, called forth the same <lb/>
love that they did. Neither could I tell how bitter and <lb/>
grievous any misbehaviour among them was to me; and <lb/>
because no one guessed at the depth of either the love <lb/>
or the sorrow, I had but little sympathy under <reg orig="disap-|pointments">disappointments</reg> <lb/>
with them. I am wrong in one thing I know, <lb/>
but cannot help it; the feeling that, though I may have <lb/>
a very sincere love and interest in other children, yet I <lb/>
should never be able to give any future class the same <lb/>
intensity of affection which these have won and some of <lb/>
them have reciprocated. It has been to my own soul a <lb/>
means of grace. Often, when cold and lifeless in prayer, <lb/>
my nightly intercession for them has unsealed the frozen <lb/>
fountain, and the blessings sought for them seemed to <lb/>
fall on myself.</p>
<p>"Often and often have my own words to them been <lb/>
as a message to myself of warning or peace. My only <lb/>
regret is that I did not spend more time in preparing my <lb/>
lessons for them, not more on their account than my <lb/>
own, for seldom have Bible truths seemed to reach and <lb/>
touch me more than when seeking to arrange and <reg orig="sim-|plify">simplify</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="224" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0241"/>
them for my children. Therefore, I thank God that <lb/>
these children have been entrusted to me!</p>
<p>"For some weeks past several of them have come to <lb/>
me, once a week, for separate reading and prayer. <lb/>
These times I have enjoyed very much. I rather <reg orig="dis-|suaded">dissuaded</reg> <lb/>
than otherwise, unless any real desire for <reg orig="sal-|vation">salvation</reg> <lb/>
was manifested; and I do think that this was so <lb/>
far effectual that nearly all of those who did come were, at <lb/>
least at the time, truly in earnest on the great question. <lb/>
I mark * the regular, <hi rend="super">&times;</hi> the occasional comers. Nearly <lb/>
two years have already passed since they were 'my <lb/>
children,' and I cannot say that my love and interest <lb/>
have yet diminished."</p>
<p>In 1856, Frances Havergal paid a visit to Celbridge <lb/>
Lodge, Ireland, and here we have an Irish school-girl's <lb/>
letter concerning her:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Five o'clock p.m. was the hour appointed for the <lb/>
elder girls from the school to arrive at the Lodge. Mrs. <lb/>
Shaw met us at the hall door with gentle words to each, <lb/>
and then brought us into the drawing-room, we being <lb/>
in a great state of delight at the thought of seeing the <lb/>
'little English lady.' In a few seconds Miss Frances, <lb/>
carolling like a bird, flashed into the room! Flashed! <lb/>
yes, I say the word advisedly, flashed in like a burst of <lb/>
sunshine, like a hillside breeze, and stood before us, her <lb/>
fair sunny curls falling round her shoulders, her bright <lb/>
eyes dancing, and her fresh sweet voice ringing through <lb/>
the room. I shall never forget that afternoon, never! <lb/>
I sat perfectly spellbound as she sang chant and hymn <lb/>
<pb n="225" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0242"/>
with marvellous sweetness, and then played two or three <lb/>
pieces of Handel, which thrilled me through and through. <lb/>
She finished with singing her father's tune &lpar;Hobah&rpar; to <lb/>
'The Church of our Fathers.' She shook hands with <lb/>
each, and said with a merry laugh, 'the next time I come <lb/>
to Ireland I think we must get up a little singing class, <lb/>
and then you know you must all sing with me!' As <lb/>
we walked home down the shady avenue, one and <lb/>
another said, 'Oh, isn't she lovely? and doesn't she sing <lb/>
like a born angel!' 'I love her, I do; and I'd follow her <lb/>
every step of the way back to England if I could.' <lb/>
'Oh, she's a real Colleen Bawn!'</p>
<p>"Another of the class felt, all the time, that there <lb/>
must be the music of God's own love in that fair singer's <lb/>
heart, and that so there was joy in her face, joy in her <lb/>
words, joy in her ways. And the secret cry went up <lb/>
from that young Irish heart: 'Lord, teach me, even me, <lb/>
to know and love Thee too.'"</p>
<p>On her next visit to Ireland the promised singing-class <lb/>
was formed. From this time &lpar;1858&rpar; she seems to have <lb/>
learned the Scriptures systematically with her friend <lb/>
Elizabeth Clay. At this period she knew the whole of <lb/>
the Gospels, Epistles, Revelation, the Psalms, and <lb/>
Isaiah, and the Minor Prophets she learned in later <lb/>
years. At this time, too, she was taking the titles of <lb/>
Christ for her daily searchings and remarks. "<reg orig="Yester-|day">Yesterday</reg>," <lb/>
she says, "I took Christ our Advocate, it is one of <lb/>
the sweet titles. Alpha and Omega will be a very <reg orig="suit-|able">suitable</reg> <lb/>
one for Sunday. I like to think about the Lord <lb/>
<pb n="226" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0243"/>
Jesus as He is in Himself, not <hi rend="italic">only</hi> in relation to <reg orig="my-|self">myself</reg>."</p>
<p>We must again fall back upon her sister's "Memorials <lb/>
of Frances Ridley Havergal."</p>
<p>"In 1861, by the wish of her sister and brother-in-law <lb/>
Henry Crane, Frances undertook the instruction of her <lb/>
two youngest nieces, and made Oakhampton her second <lb/>
home. Her father approved of this plan, because he <lb/>
thought it would prevent her from pursuing the severe <lb/>
studies so prejudicial to her health. The lesson hours <lb/>
were very short, owing to the temperament of both <lb/>
teacher and pupils, and she had many and long changes <lb/>
of scene, at the seaside, at home and abroad. She <lb/>
entered with zest into the recreations of her young <reg orig="com-|panions">companions</reg>, <lb/>
riding and scrambling, swinging and skating, <lb/>
croquet and chess, each in its turn, and excelled in them <lb/>
all. Her needlework was exquisite, from the often <reg orig="de-|spised">despised</reg> <lb/>
darning to the most delicate lace work and <reg orig="em-|broidery">embroidery</reg>. <lb/>
How she redeemed her time these few lines <lb/>
will prove: 'Stirring you up, dearie, to mental <reg orig="improve-|ment">improvement</reg> <lb/>
is no new subject to me. I know, by my own <lb/>
teaching days, how very much might be learned in all <lb/>
the odds and ends of time, how &lpar;<hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi>&rpar; I learnt all the <lb/>
Italian verbs while my nieces were washing their hands <lb/>
for dinner after our walk, because I could be ready in <lb/>
five minutes less time than they could.' The faithful old <lb/>
nurse also remembers 'vexing over Miss Frances's hard <lb/>
studying, and that she found her at those Latin books <lb/>
long before breakfast.'"</p>
<pb n="227" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0244"/>
<p>From the close of her Autobiography, darkness seems <lb/>
to have clouded her path. From time to time she <lb/>
writes:</p>
<p>"I had hoped that a kind of table-land had been <lb/>
reached in my journey, where I might walk awhile in the <lb/>
light, without the weary succession of rock and hollow, <lb/>
crag and morass, stumbling and striving, but I seem <lb/>
borne back into all the old difficulties of the way, with <lb/>
many sin-made aggravations. I think the great root of <lb/>
all my trouble and alienation is that I do not now make <lb/>
an unreserved surrender of myself to God; and until <lb/>
this is done I shall know no peace. I am sure of it. I <lb/>
have so much to regret; a greater dread of the opinion <lb/>
of worldly friends, a loving of the world and <reg orig="proportion-|ate">proportionate</reg> <lb/>
cooling in heavenly desire and love. A power utterly <lb/>
new and unexpected was given me &lsqb;singing and <reg orig="composi-|tion">composition</reg> <lb/>
of music&rsqb;, and rejoicing in this I forgot the Giver, <lb/>
and found such delight in this that other things faded <lb/>
before it. It need not have been so; and, in better <lb/>
moments, I prayed that if it were indeed hindering me, <lb/>
the gift of song might be withdrawn. And now that <lb/>
through my ill-health it is so, and that the pleasure of <lb/>
public applause when singing at the Philharmonic <reg orig="con-|certs">concerts</reg> <lb/>
is not again to exercise its delirious delusion, I do <lb/>
thank Him who heard my prayer. But I often pray in <lb/>
the dark as it were, and feel no response from above. <lb/>
Is this to test me? Oh that I may be preserved from <lb/>
giving up in despair, and yielding, as I often do, to the <lb/>
floodtide enemy.</p>
<pb n="228" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0245"/>
<p>"I want to make the most of my life and to do the <lb/>
best with it, but here I feel my desires and my motives <lb/>
need much purifying, for even when all would sound fair <lb/>
enough in words, an element of self, of lurking pride, <lb/>
may be detected. Oh, that He would indeed purify me <lb/>
and make me white at any cost! No one professing to <lb/>
be a Christian at all could possibly have had a more <lb/>
cloudy, fearing, doubting, and wandering heart history <lb/>
than mine has been through many years."</p>
<p>In the early part of 1865 Frances Havergal fell ill, <lb/>
and had to relinquish much of her excellent work. <reg orig="Sun-|day">Sunday</reg> <lb/>
school, Saturday evening class, visiting, music, etc. <lb/>
This only had the effect of evoking more religious fervour. <lb/>
She says:</p>
<p>"It was very trying to me, specially so because I had <lb/>
rather built upon being stronger, and several points of <lb/>
interest had arisen which made me feel the more being <lb/>
shut off from all. But it was very good for me. I was <lb/>
able to feel thankful for it, and to be glad that God had <lb/>
taken me in hand as it were. I do not think that I <lb/>
would have chosen it otherwise than as He ordered it for <lb/>
me; but it seems as if a spiritual life would never go <reg orig="with-|out">without</reg> <lb/>
weights, and I dread needing more discipline."</p>
<p>We will now follow her in her great musical abilities, <lb/>
and on this subject we cannot do better than quote part <lb/>
of a letter she sent her sister Miriam in 1866:</p>
<p>"Elizabeth C. told the Schulzeberges of my composing, <lb/>
and so they were curious about it, and wanted me to go <lb/>
to the Musical Academy of Cologne. As I declared that <lb/>
<pb n="229" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0246"/>
out of the question, they hoped I would go to Ferdinand <lb/>
Hiller, whom they consider the greatest living composer <lb/>
and authority, and show him my songs. I shrunk from <lb/>
this because I expected nothing but utter quenching <lb/>
from such a man; still I thought that after all I might as <lb/>
well know the worst, and if he thought scorn of all I had <lb/>
done, that would decide me to waste no more time over <lb/>
it; while, if I got a favourable verdict, if ever opportunity <lb/>
should arise of prosecuting the <hi rend="italic">study</hi> of composition, I <lb/>
should do so with a clearer conscience and better hopes. <lb/>
To my utter amazement, papa quite urged me to go, and <lb/>
a pleasant mirage of a possible musical term at Cologne <lb/>
screwed my courage up to writing to Hiller, who replied <lb/>
kindly, and made an appointment with me. I went with <lb/>
mamma, such a queer way among the Rhine wharfs, and <lb/>
through narrow streets scarcely wide enough for the <lb/>
droschky to pass, till we emerged in a more open part, and <lb/>
found Hiller's abode. He is a small elderly man, quiet <lb/>
in manner, of handsome and peculiar Jewish physiognomy <lb/>
&lpar;he is a Jew&rpar;, with a forehead remarkably like papa's, and <lb/>
terribly clever looking eyes; I think one would single him <lb/>
out as a genius among any number. He was in a double <lb/>
room full of musical litter, with a handsome grand piano <lb/>
in the middle. He received us very politely, and asked <lb/>
me a few questions &lpar;he is a man of few words&rpar;, and then <lb/>
took my book of songs and sat down to <hi rend="italic">read</hi> it through, <lb/>
giving me a volume of poetry to amuse myself with <reg orig="mean-|while">meanwhile</reg>. <lb/>
You may imagine I didn't read much! He <lb/>
made no remark till he was about three-quarters through, <lb/>
<pb n="230" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0247"/>
when he turned and said: 'What instruction have you <lb/>
had?' I told him of Hatherley's having corrected my <lb/>
first six songs, and that I had a musical father to whom I <lb/>
occasionally referred difficult points, and with whom I <lb/>
had musical talk in general. 'I do not care anything <lb/>
about that,' said he, 'I mean, what regular musical course <lb/>
have you gone through, and under what professor?' I <lb/>
told him I had done nothing of the sort. He looked <lb/>
very hard at me, as if to see if I was telling the truth, and <lb/>
then turned back to my music, saying, 'In that case I <lb/>
find this very remarkable!' When he had finished he <lb/>
delivered his verdict, the worst part first. He said my <lb/>
melodies bore the stamp of talent, not of genius. 'In <lb/>
the early works of great composers,' he said, 'one comes <lb/>
across things that startle and strike you, ideas so utterly <lb/>
fresh and novel that you feel there is great creative power. <lb/>
I do not find this in your melodies; they are not bad; on <lb/>
the contrary I find them very pleasing and many really <lb/>
very good, but they are thoroughly English in character <lb/>
and type; I do not consider that English melodies rank <lb/>
highest. But, as for your harmonies, I must say I am <lb/>
astonished. It is something singular to find such grasp <lb/>
of the subject, such power of harmonization, except <lb/>
where there has been long and thorough study and <reg orig="in-|struction">instruction</reg>; <lb/>
here I can give almost unlimited praise.' I <lb/>
told him my question was &lpar;for I thought I would like to <lb/>
take a high standard at once&rpar; not, had I talent enough <lb/>
to make music a mere pleasure to myself and myfriends? <lb/>
but had I enough to make it worth while to devote <reg orig="my-|self">myself</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="231" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0248"/>
to music as a serious thing, as a life work? Was there <lb/>
promise enough to make it an advisable investment of my <lb/>
life, in case I wished to do so? He said, 'Sincerely and <lb/>
unhesitatingly I can say that you <hi rend="italic">have</hi>.' I remarked how <lb/>
much I should like to study at Cologne, and under <reg orig="him-|self">himself</reg>. <lb/>
He said he should like to have the training of me; <lb/>
but, if distance were a difficulty, there were reliable men <lb/>
in London. But I was to go to no second-rate man, that <lb/>
would be simply no use to me; I could only gain the <lb/>
polish and 'form' which my work wanted, from some <lb/>
one really first-rate. He recommended me a book on <lb/>
harmony, and then wrote a few lines to papa, saying he <lb/>
had found a good deal of musical talent in my <reg orig="composi-|tions">compositions</reg>, <lb/>
and that 'but a short time would be sufficient to <lb/>
place me in a state to give a good form to the musical <lb/>
ideas with which I was gifted.' I did not expect all <lb/>
this; and though I shall not do anything at present, it is <lb/>
pleasant to know I have a talent which I may some day <lb/>
develop to some purpose."</p>
<p>Her sister-biographer relates "that such was the <lb/>
strength of her musical memory, that she would fly <lb/>
through Handel, much of Beethoven and Mendelssohn, <lb/>
without any notes. A pupil of Beethoven thought her <lb/>
rendering of the 'Moonlight Sonata' perfect, her touch was <lb/>
instinct with soul, as was also her singing. The practice <lb/>
of sacred music was an extreme gratification to her, and <lb/>
she soon became a valued solo singer. Her rendering <lb/>
of Mendelssohn's 'Woe unto them,' 'But the Lord is <lb/>
mindful of His own,' are remembered as peculiarly <reg orig="effec-|tive">effective</reg>, <lb/>
<pb n="232" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0249"/>
though it was in Handel's music that she more <lb/>
particularly delighted."</p>
<p>So pretty and playful is the following poem, showing, <lb/>
too, the ease with which she versified family events, we <lb/>
cannot resist quoting it from the "Memorials":&mdash; <lb/>

<p>In 1867 she took singing lessons from Signor <reg orig="Ran-|degger">Randegger</reg>. <lb/>
His first lesson was a lecture on the formation <lb/>
of the throat and the production of sound, which he told <lb/>
her to write an abstract of. The next day indisposition <lb/>
confined her to her bed, and having nothing to do it <lb/>
occurred to Frances to rhyme it, and the Signor had a <lb/>
copy of it.</p>

<l>A wonderful organ-pipe firstly we trace,</l>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>Here endeth the substance of what I remember,</l>
<l>Indited this twenty-sixth day of November."</l>
</lg></q>
<p>On the 19th of April, 1870, she had the great sorrow <lb/>
to lose her father, the Rev. William Havergal, M.A. On <lb/>
Easter Even, 1870, he was unusually well, and had <lb/>
walked out during the day. Later on he sat down to <lb/>
his harmonium, playing and singing the tune composed <lb/>
by him in the morning. He rose early as usual, on <lb/>
Easter Day; but apoplexy ensued, and after forty-eight <lb/>
hours of unconsciousness, he passed away in his <reg orig="seventy-|seventh">seventy-seventh</reg> <lb/>
year.</p>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"'Yet speaketh!' there was no last word of love,</l>
<l rend="indent">So suddenly on us the sorrow fell;</l>
<l>His bright translation to the home above</l>
<l rend="indent">Was clouded with no shadow of farewell;</l>
<l>His last Lent evening closed with praise and prayer,</l>
<l>And then began the songs of endless Easter there."</l>
</lg></q>
<p>Her literary productions were voluminous, and her <lb/>
composition rapid. But she ascribed all her thoughts <lb/>
and the rapidity of her pen to the Master who guided <lb/>
it. In a letter addressed to "Dear Mr. W<gap desc="long dash" reason="missing" id="g10"/>," she <lb/>
says:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I can't make you quite understand me! You say <lb/>
F. R. H. could do 'Satisfied' grandly! <hi rend="italic">No</hi>, she couldn't. <lb/>
Not unless He gave it me line by line! That is how <lb/>
<pb n="236" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0253"/>
verses come. The Master has not put a chest of poetic <lb/>
gold in my possession, and said, 'Now use it as you <lb/>
like.' But He keeps the gold, and gives it me piece by <lb/>
piece just when He will, and as much as He will, and <lb/>
no more. Some day perhaps He will send me a bright <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">line</hi> of verse on 'Satisfied,' ringing through my mind, and <lb/>
then I shall look up and thank Him, and say, 'Now, <lb/>
dear Master, give me another to rhyme with it, and <lb/>
then another'; and then perhaps He will send it all <lb/>
in one flow of musical thoughts, but more likely one at <lb/>
a time, that I may be kept asking Him for every line. <lb/>
There, that is the process, and you see there is no 'I <lb/>
can do it' at all. That isn't His way with me. I often <lb/>
smile to myself when people talk about 'gifted pen,' or <lb/>
'clever verses,' etc., because they don't know that it is <lb/>
neither, but something really much nicer than being <lb/>
'talented' or 'clever.'"</p>
<p>"Nearly every poem," says her sister, "would verify <lb/>
the above. Some instances are given. When visiting <lb/>
at Perry Barr, she walked to the boys' schoolroom, and <lb/>
being very tired she leaned against the playground wall <lb/>
while Mr. Snepp went in. Returning in ten minutes, he <lb/>
found her scribbling on an old envelope, and at his <lb/>
request she handed him the hymn just pencilled, <lb/>
'Golden harps are sounding.'"</p>
<p>Her Christian faith was of a most encouraging kind, <lb/>
and was severely tested. In the latter part of 1874, <lb/>
she was struck down with typhoid fever and her life was <lb/>
in the balance:</p>
<pb n="237" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0254"/>
<p>"Somehow or somewhere," writes her sister in the <lb/>
"Memorials," "she caught fever, and commenced her <lb/>
homeward journey &lpar;from Switzerland&rpar; with dull headache <lb/>
and sickness. Home was reached, shiverings and <reg orig="fever-|ish">feverish</reg> <lb/>
symptoms rapidly set in, and she was soon utterly <lb/>
prostrate with typhoid fever. All that motherly <reg orig="watch-|fulness">watchfulness</reg>, <lb/>
medical skill, and trained nursing could do failed <lb/>
to arrest the attack. About the middle of November <lb/>
the balancings of our hopes and fears were just between <lb/>
life and death. Prayer was made unceasingly for the <lb/>
life so dear to us, and even special prayer meetings were <lb/>
held to plead for one known so widely, though <reg orig="prin-|cipally">principally</reg> <lb/>
by her writings. Our prayers and cries and tears <lb/>
were answered, and our beloved one was restored. <lb/>
Some weeks after she told me many things which may <lb/>
be profitable to others:&mdash;</p>
<p>"'All through my long illness I was very happy; the <lb/>
first part was the most painful. I don't really think I <lb/>
was impatient deep down in my heart, and yet the pain <lb/>
and agony I was in made me anxious for the poultices, <lb/>
and to try anything. I do think I am sensitive to pain, <lb/>
and what was agony to me would be slight to others. <lb/>
My one wish was to glorify God and to let my doctor <lb/>
and nurse see it; so at the very first I determined to ask <lb/>
for nothing and just <hi rend="italic">obey</hi>. Nothing could exceed dear <lb/>
mother's kindness and tenderness to me day and night, <lb/>
and getting everything I wished for. For some time, <lb/>
even in those bright days in the Ormont Dessus, I had <lb/>
a presentiment that, may be, my faith would be tried, <lb/>
<pb n="238" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0255"/>
and that my Father would not leave me without <reg orig="chas-|tisement">chastisement</reg>. <lb/>
Not that I think illness such a trial as many <lb/>
others I have gone through; oh, it is nothing to <hi rend="italic">unseen</hi> <lb/>
trials! Besides, you get such sympathy in illness, and I <lb/>
knew many would pray for me. Only I did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> want <lb/>
them to pray that I might get well at all. Sometimes I <lb/>
could not <hi rend="italic">quite</hi> see His Face, yet there was His promise <lb/>
"I will never leave thee." I knew He said it and that <lb/>
He was there.'"</p>
<p>Her sister asked her if she had any fear to die?</p>
<p>"'Oh no, not a shadow,' she replied. 'It was on the <lb/>
first day of this illness I dictated to Constance, "Just as <lb/>
Thou wilt, O Master, call!"'</p>
<p>"'Then, was it delightful to think you were going <lb/>
home, dear Fan?'</p>
<p>"'No, it was not the idea of going home, but that <hi rend="italic">He</hi> <lb/>
was coming for me and that I should <hi rend="italic">see my King</hi>. I <lb/>
never thought of death as going through the dark valley <lb/>
or down to the river; it often seemed to me a going up <lb/>
to the golden gates and lying there in the brightness, <lb/>
just waiting for the gate to open for me. &hellip; I <lb/>
never before was, so to speak, face to face with death. <lb/>
It was like a look into heaven; and yet, when my Father <lb/>
sent me back again, I felt it was His will, and so I <lb/>
could not be disappointed.'"</p>
<p>No sooner, it appears, had the patient, loving Christian <lb/>
lady recovered from one illness than she was attacked <lb/>
by another. Throughout the whole of the year 1875 <lb/>
she was more or less stricken with illness, yet she did <lb/>
<pb n="239" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0256"/>
much work and wrote many beautiful letters to friends, <lb/>
for which we must refer the reader to the volume of <lb/>
"Memorials."<ref target="n3" n="1">*</ref>
<note id="n3" place="foot" n="1"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>"Memorials of Frances Ridley Havergal." By her Sister, <lb/>
M. V. G. H. Nisbet &amp; Co., Berners Street, London.</p></note>
</p>
<p>One interesting anecdote concerning her well-known <lb/>
book "My King." Her sister says:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I well remember when Frances first thought of <lb/>
writing 'My King.' We were returning from <reg orig="Switzer-|land">Switzerland</reg>. <lb/>
Her illness there had quite hindered any writing, <lb/>
and she seemed to regret having no book ready for <lb/>
Christmas. It was October 21st, 1876, we had passed <lb/>
Oxford station, on our way to Winterdyne, and I thought <lb/>
she was dozing, when she exclaimed, with that herald <lb/>
flash in her eye, 'Marie! I see it all, I can write a little <lb/>
book, "My King,"' and rapidly went through divisions for <lb/>
thirty-one chapters. The setting sun shone on her face; <lb/>
and, even then, it seemed to me she could not be far <lb/>
distant from the land of the King. Illness came on <lb/>
again, accompanied by severe suffering, yet the book was <lb/>
quickly written and published."</p>
<p>We now further trespass on the volume of "<reg orig="Memor-|ials">Memorials</reg>" <lb/>
for Miss Havergal's views on dress:&mdash;</p>
<p>"The outer should be the expression of the inner; <lb/>
not an ugly mask or disguise. If the King's daughter is <lb/>
to be 'all-glorious within,' she must not be outwardly a <lb/>
fright. I must dress both as a lady and a Christian. <lb/>
The question of cost I see very strongly, and do not <lb/>
<pb n="240" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0257"/>
consider myself at liberty to spend on dress that which <lb/>
might be spared for God's work; but it costs no more <lb/>
to have a thing well and prettily made, and I should <lb/>
only feel justified in getting a costly dress if it would <lb/>
last proportionately longer. When working among <lb/>
strangers, if I dressed below par, it would attract <lb/>
attention, and might excite opposition; by dressing <lb/>
unremarkably, and yet with a generally pleasing effect, <lb/>
no attention is distracted. Also, what is suitable in <lb/>
one house is not so in another, and it would be almost <lb/>
an insult to appear at dinner among some of my <lb/>
relatives and friends in what I could wear without <lb/>
apology at home; it would be an actual breach of the <lb/>
rule 'Be courteous;' also, I should not think it right to <lb/>
appear among wedding guests in a dress which would be <lb/>
perfectly suitable for wearing to the Infirmary. But I <lb/>
should always ask for guidance in all things."</p>
<p>These sensible remarks on dress command attention, <lb/>
and open out the well-balanced character of Frances <lb/>
Havergal, showing that though her mind was much <lb/>
occupied with heavenly things, she never forgot to <lb/>
"render unto C&aelig;sar the things that are C&aelig;sar's." She <lb/>
was always careful not to appear singular or eccentric, <lb/>
and always careful of the opinions of others.</p>
<p>The beauty of dress consists in not being <reg orig="conspicu-|ous">conspicuous</reg>; <lb/>
in neither distorting nor yet concealing the human <lb/>
form with unnatural additions. By far too much time is <lb/>
engrossed by dress. The outer form conceals an <reg orig="im-|mortal">immortal</reg> <lb/>
spirit, but the tendencies of that spirit are often <lb/>
<pb n="241" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0258"/>
made known by acts, apparently immaterial, yet <reg orig="never-|theless">nevertheless</reg> <lb/>
important. Dress, therefore, ought to be simple, <lb/>
elegant, and becoming, without being too expensive for <lb/>
the wearer, and singularity always avoided.</p>
<p>Personal appearance is, doubtless, a subject for <lb/>
Christian consideration, and every woman ought to <lb/>
dress with reference to her position in society, especially <lb/>
if she mingles in it; a sensible and refined <reg orig="gentle-|woman">gentlewoman</reg> <lb/>
will never attire herself in a manner <reg orig="unbecom-|ing">unbecoming</reg> <lb/>
either to her circumstances or her person; but her <lb/>
costume should be neat, clean, appropriate, modest, <lb/>
unobtrusive; not expressive of ostentation, vanity, or <lb/>
self-conceit. Dress is a language speaking to the eye; <lb/>
dress is an indication of character, and a means of <lb/>
influence, and of education. Shabbiness of dress is a <lb/>
demoralisation. Behaviour is influenced by costume. <lb/>
Christian women who are careless in their dress are <lb/>
likely to be careless in their habits and manners; when <lb/>
they put on nice clothes they assume a corresponding <lb/>
behaviour.</p>
<p>There may be times and circumstances when people do <lb/>
well to put on sackcloth and ashes, and dress for <reg orig="humili-|ation">humiliation</reg> <lb/>
and mortification. In the sadness of a great <lb/>
calamity we put off gay attire; and though we may not <lb/>
obtrude our grief by mourning weeds, we should not <lb/>
wear bright colours. But in our ordinary life and <reg orig="enjoy-|ments">enjoyments</reg> <lb/>
we ought to be in harmony with the beauty of the <lb/>
world around us&mdash;with earth and skies, trees and flowers. <lb/>
All dress should display and adorn the beauty of the <lb/>
<pb n="242" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0259"/>
human body, and conceal its defects, but never distort <lb/>
and deform.</p>
<p>We should dress for our own health, comfort, and <lb/>
sense of beauty and fitness, first; and then to please, <lb/>
attract, satisfy, and delight all around us. We have no <lb/>
right to offend by rags or filth; nor even by uncouth <lb/>
forms and unpleasant colours. To dress decently and <lb/>
neatly is a duty&mdash;to dress so as to increase the <reg orig="hap-|piness">happiness</reg> <lb/>
of others should be our delight.</p>
<p>Tertullian's remarks on dress are well worth attention. <lb/>
He says:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Let women paint their eyes with tints of chastity, <lb/>
insert into their ears the word of God, tie the yoke of <lb/>
Christ around their necks, and adorn their whole persons <lb/>
with the silk of sanctity and the damask of devotion; <lb/>
let them adopt that chaste and simple, that neat and <lb/>
elegant style of dress, which so advantageously displays <lb/>
the charms of real beauty, instead of those preposterous <lb/>
fashions and fantastical draperies of dress which, while <lb/>
they conceal some few defects of person, expose so many <lb/>
defects of mind, and sacrifice to ostentatious finery all <lb/>
those mild, amiable, and modest virtues, by which the <lb/>
female character is so pleasingly adorned."</p>
<p>Some one has thus spiritually and poetically described <lb/>
what the dress of a lady should be:&mdash;"Let your <reg orig="ear-|rings">earrings</reg> <lb/>
be attention, encircled by the pearls of refinement. <lb/>
Let the diamonds of your necklace be truth, and the <lb/>
chain of Christianity. Let your bracelets be charity, <lb/>
ornamented with the pearls of gentleness. Let your <lb/>
<pb n="243" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0260"/>
bosom-pin be modesty, set with compassion. Let your <lb/>
finger-rings be affection, set with the diamonds of <lb/>
industry. Let your girdle be simplicity, with a tassel of <lb/>
good humour. Let your garb be virtue, your drapery <lb/>
politeness. Let your shoes be wisdom, secured with the <lb/>
buckles of perseverance."</p>
<p>We now pass from the subject of dress to other <reg orig="sub-|jects">subjects</reg> <lb/>
in the "Memorials of Frances Ridley Havergal"; <lb/>
a volume stored with themes of the greatest importance <lb/>
to mankind, and one which should be devoutly studied. <lb/>
It is the record of a beautiful life, made bright by the <lb/>
cultivation of sound Christian principles and her <reg orig="de-|votion">devotion</reg> <lb/>
to inspire others with the love of God.</p>
<p>The following extract from a letter to D. S. will show <lb/>
the amount of correspondence and literary work she was <lb/>
engaged in:&mdash;</p>
<p>"What shall I do? Your letter would take two hours <lb/>
to answer, and I have not ten minutes; fifteen to twenty <lb/>
letters to write every morning, proofs to correct, editors <lb/>
waiting for articles, poems and music I cannot touch, <lb/>
American publishers clamouring for poems or <hi rend="italic">any</hi> <reg orig="manu-|scripts">manuscripts</reg>, <lb/>
four Bible readings or classes weekly, many <lb/>
anxious ones waiting for help, a mission week coming, and <lb/>
other hard work after that. And my doctor says my <lb/>
physique is too weak to balance the nerves and brain, <lb/>
and that I ought not to touch a pen. If you could see <lb/>
the pressure on me, you would not think me wet-<reg orig="blanket-|ing">blanketing</reg> <lb/>
if I do not answer <hi rend="italic">all</hi> your queries."</p>
<p>She was a most active member of the "Christian <reg orig="Pro-|gress">Progress</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="244" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0261"/>
Scripture Reading Union," and the means of <reg orig="en-|rolling">enrolling</reg> <lb/>
hundreds of others. Also the "Church <reg orig="Mission-|ary">Missionary</reg> <lb/>
Society," the "Church Pastoral-Aid Society," and the <lb/>
"Irish Society" have much to be thankful to her for in <lb/>
the good services she did them, and these societies have <lb/>
expressed their gratitude to her in numerous ways. As to <lb/>
the "Irish Society," from collecting &pound;1 in 1856, she had <lb/>
in March, 1879, sent in more than &pound;900, and organized <lb/>
a branch society in Worcester, and appointed a little girl <lb/>
as her first collector; the little girl's name was "Bruey," <lb/>
and it was called the "Bruey Branch."</p>
<p>Her sister, the author of the "Memorials," thus <lb/>
portrays Frances at home:</p>
<p>"May I sketch her at her study table, in her favourite <lb/>
chair from Astley Rectory, older than herself? Her <lb/>
American type-writer was close by, so that she could <lb/>
turn to it from her desk; it was a great relief to her eyes, <lb/>
but its rapid working often told me she was busy when <lb/>
she should have rested. Her desk and table drawers <lb/>
were all methodically arranged for letters from editors, <lb/>
friends, relatives, strangers, matters of business, <reg orig="multi-|tudinous">multitudinous</reg> <lb/>
requests, Irish Society work, manuscripts; paper <lb/>
and string in their allotted corners, no litter ever allowed. <lb/>
It was at her study table that she read her Bible by <lb/>
seven o'clock in the summer, and eight o'clock in winter, <lb/>
her Hebrew Bible, Greek Testament, and lexicons <lb/>
being at hand. Sometimes, on bitterly cold mornings, <lb/>
I begged that she would read with her feet <reg orig="comfort-|ably">comfortably</reg> <lb/>
to the fire, and received the reply: 'But then, <lb/>
<pb n="245" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0262"/>
Marie, I can't rule my lines neatly; just see what a find <lb/>
I've got! If one only searches there are such <reg orig="ex-|traordinary">extraordinary</reg> <lb/>
things in the Bible!'</p>
<p>"Her harp-piano was placed on a stand she contrived <lb/>
by dexterous carpentering. It was at this instrument she <lb/>
composed 'Loving all Along,' and many other melodies <lb/>
to her hymns in 'Loyal Responses.' Often I heard <lb/>
flashes of melody thereon, that came unbidden amid <lb/>
severer work. In the south window, its sea view <reg orig="stretch-|ing">stretching</reg> <lb/>
over to Ilfracombe, stood her little table, flowers, <lb/>
and easy chair; her sofa faced the west window, with the <lb/>
view of Caswell Bay and its rocks, and there the sunset <lb/>
came which we so often watched together. She resolutely <lb/>
refrained from late hours, and frittering talks at night, <lb/>
instead of Bible searching and holy communings. Early <lb/>
rising and early studying were her rule through life, while <lb/>
punctuality and bright, quick cheeriness characterized <lb/>
all she did."</p>
<p>The above extract shows her to have been a woman of <lb/>
taste, method, and learning, as well as a devout Christian <lb/>
and an earnest worker; while the following shows her <lb/>
great popularity. One post brought such multifarious <lb/>
requests as these, and they all had to be dealt with in <lb/>
some form or other, which involved unceasing labour:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Request for contribution to <hi rend="italic">Irish Church Advocate.</hi> <lb/>
Hymns for special New Year services wanted. To <lb/>
write cards suitable for mourners. For set of six more <lb/>
'Marching Orders' Request for poems to illustrate six <lb/>
pictures. For prayer, sympathy, and counsel &lpar;two <lb/>
<pb n="246" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0263"/>
sheets crossed&rpar;. Two sheets from a septuagenarian, <lb/>
requiring thought. Request to write a book suitable for <lb/>
Unitarians. Sundry inquiries and apologies from one <lb/>
who had been printing her verses with another author's <lb/>
name. Request to reprint an article, with four <reg orig="explana-|tory">explanatory</reg> <lb/>
enclosures. Also to revise a proof and add my <lb/>
opinion. To revise many sheets of musical manuscripts. <lb/>
Three requests to supply cards for bazaars. Advice <lb/>
wanted how to get articles inserted in magazines. To <lb/>
recommend pupils. To promote a new magazine. To <lb/>
give opinion on an oratorio. Some long poems in <lb/>
manuscript to revise and advise thereon. Besides <lb/>
packets of leaflets and cards wanted."</p>
<p>We must refer the reader to the volume itself for her <lb/>
admirable method of reading the Bible, and her diligent <lb/>
searchings. "Truly," says her affectionate sister, in her <lb/>
charming "Memorials," "her delight was in the law of <lb/>
the Lord, it was always her standard of appeal; and, by <lb/>
comparing Scripture with Scripture, she grasped its <reg orig="all-|sided">all-sided</reg> <lb/>
truth, rejoicing therein as one that findeth great <lb/>
spoil."</p>
<p>We have not yet referred to her work in the <reg orig="temper-|ance">temperance</reg> <lb/>
cause, which was of some importance in the <lb/>
limited sphere in which she laboured, as the following <lb/>
extract from a letter to a friend will sufficiently prove:</p>
<p>"I have got the <hi rend="italic">whole</hi> rising generation of the village <lb/>
to sign the pledge &lpar;all between eight and sixteen&rpar;, except <lb/>
two boys who won't sign, three who broke, and one girl <lb/>
'going to sign!' Also about fifty grown-ups. My little <lb/>
<pb n="247" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0264"/>
lads are splendid: such hearty enthusiasm about it! <lb/>
Temperance meeting to-night, at which I was popularly <lb/>
supposed to be going to speak! But I have to entrust <lb/>
it all to others under God."</p>
<p>At this time &lpar;May 28, 1879&rpar; she was again laid up <lb/>
with fever, from which she never, alas! recovered. "May <lb/>
26th, she could not attend to her letters, but corrected the <lb/>
proof of 'Morning Stars,' on the text 'I am the bright <lb/>
and morning Star'; and then the pen so long used in <lb/>
the service of her King was laid down. She was not <lb/>
suffering very much, lying quietly in bed, her pet kittens <lb/>
Trot and Dot on her duvet. She rather astonished her <lb/>
doctor by saying, 'Do you think I've a chance of <lb/>
going?' He told her that she was not seriously ill, and <lb/>
asked if she really liked lying there, and in pain.</p>
<p>'"Yes, I do; it is as if an errand-boy were told to take <lb/>
a message, and afterwards his master bids him <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to go.'</p>
<p>"The last passage she looked at in her Bible was the <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Christian Progress</hi> chapter for May 28th &lpar;Rev. ii. 1&ndash;10&rpar;. <lb/>
She asked Mary to read it for her, dwelling on 'Be thou <lb/>
faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life,' <lb/>
bidding her turn to the reference in James i. 12. &lpar;It is <lb/>
remarkable that the same promise of 'the crown of life' <lb/>
was the last passage our dear father ever read.&rpar; On May <lb/>
29th fever and internal inflammation rapidly came on, <lb/>
and all the symptoms and agony of peritonitis. God <lb/>
seemed to permit severest suffering, and all remedies <lb/>
failed. But her peace and joy shone through it all."</p>
<p>Her sister asked, "Have you any fear?"</p>
<pb n="248" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0265"/>
<p>"'Why should I? Jesus said, "It is finished," and <lb/>
what was His precious blood shed for? <hi rend="italic">I trust that.'</hi></p>
<p>"In the early dawn of Whit Monday Frances said to <lb/>
me, "Spite of the breakers, Marie, I am so happy; God's <lb/>
promises are so true. Not a fear.'"</p>
<p>"When one of her doctors was leaving he said, '<reg orig="Good-|bye">Goodbye</reg>, <lb/>
I shall not see you again.'</p>
<p>"'Then do you really think I am going?'</p>
<p>"'Yes.'</p>
<p>"'To-day?'</p>
<p>"'Probably.'</p>
<p>"'Beautiful, too good to be true!"</p>
<p>"Soon after she looked up smiling. 'Splendid to be <lb/>
so near the gates of heaven!'"</p>
<p>She requested her brother to sing "'Jerusalem, my <lb/>
happy home,' to papa's tune 'St. Chrysostom,' and play <lb/>
it on my harp-piano. Sing from the copy that has&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>'Jesus my Saviour dwells therein,</l>
<l rend="indent">In glorious majesty;</l>
<l>And Him through every stormy scene</l>
<l rend="indent">I onward press to see!'</l>
</lg></q>
Oh, it is the Lord Jesus that is so dear to me, I can't tell <lb/>
how precious! how much He has been to me!"</p>
<p>She was asked by the Vicar of Swansea if Jesus was <lb/>
with her now.</p>
<p>"'<hi rend="italic">Of course!</hi> It's splendid! I thought He would <lb/>
have left me here a long while; but He is <hi rend="italic">so</hi> good to take <lb/>
me now."</p>
<p>Thus she went on triumphantly to the end.</p>
<pb n="249" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0266"/>
<p>"Whispering the names of many dear ones, she added, <lb/>
'I love them all.' Then, as it were with her last look on <lb/>
them from the opening golden gates, she said yearningly <lb/>
'I want <hi rend="italic">all</hi> to come to me in heaven; oh, don't, <hi rend="italic">don't</hi> <lb/>
disappoint me, tell them "Trust Jesus."'</p>
<p>"Ellen repeated &lpar;altering the word 'canst'&rpar;&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>'Jesus, I will trust Thee,</l>
<l rend="indent">Trust Thee with my soul;</l>
<l>Guilty, lost, and helpless,</l>
<l rend="indent">Thou <hi rend="italic">hast made</hi> me whole.</l>
<l>There is none in heaven,</l>
<l rend="indent">Or on earth like Thee;</l>
<l>Thou hast died for sinners,</l>
<l rend="indent">Therefore Lord for <hi rend="italic">me!</hi></l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>"Clearly, though faintly, she sang the whole verse, to <lb/>
her own tune 'Hermas.'</p>
<p>"Then came a terrible rush of convulsive sickness. <lb/>
It ceased; the nurse gently assisting her, she nestled <lb/>
down in the pillows, folded her hands on her breast, <lb/>
saying, 'There, now it is all over! Blessed rest.'</p>
<p>"And now she looked up steadfastly as if she saw the <lb/>
Lord; and, surely, nothing less heavenly could have <reg orig="re-|flected">reflected</reg> <lb/>
such a glorious radiance upon her face. For ten <lb/>
minutes, we watched that almost visible meeting with her <lb/>
King, and her countenance was so glad, as if she were <lb/>
already talking to Him. Then she tried to sing, but after <lb/>
one sweet high note, 'HE<gap desc="long dash" reason="missing" id="g11"/>,' her voice failed; and, <lb/>
as her brother commended her soul into her Redeemer's <lb/>
hand, she passed away. Our precious sister was gone,&mdash; <lb/>
satisfied,&mdash;glorified,&mdash;within the palace of her King."</p>
<pb n="250" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0267"/>
<p>"On Monday, June 9th, at 6 a.m., the villagers and <lb/>
others assembled on the lawn while her flower-crowned <lb/>
coffin passed out. &hellip; Many relatives and friends <lb/>
joined us at Stourport, following our beloved sister to <lb/>
her father's tomb in Astley churchyard. A golden <hi rend="italic">star</hi>, <lb/>
of Banksia roses, a poet's wreath of laurel and bay, and <lb/>
many white crowns, were laid upon her. There, within <lb/>
sight of her birth-room in the rectory, and under the <lb/>
branches of the fir-tree her father planted, &lpar;and, away <lb/>
beyond, the hills and valleys of her childhood's haunts <lb/>
encircling us,&rpar; we laid our dear sister in sure and certain <lb/>
hope of her 'resurrection to eternal life.'"</p>
<p>We close this outline of her life from the "Memorials <lb/>
of Frances Ridley Havergal," with a line engraved on her <lb/>
tomb. "By her writings in prose and verse, she, 'being <lb/>

<figure id="f22" rend="block" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0268"/>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Dorothy wyndlow patteson</hi> was born <lb/>
at the village of Hauxwell, a very small village <lb/>
near Richmond, Yorkshire, on January 10th, 1832. Her <lb/>
father, the Rev. Mark Patteson, was for many years <lb/>
rector of Hauxwell; while her mother was the daughter <lb/>
of a Richmond banker. Dorothy &lpar;the name she <reg orig="pre-|ferred&rpar;">preferred&rpar;</reg> <lb/>
was the youngest but one of twelve children, two <lb/>
sons and ten daughters. From her mother she inherited <lb/>
uncommon beauty of features, and to her father may be <lb/>
traced her imposing figure and dignified bearing.</p>
<p>Until her fourteenth year she was a very delicate <lb/>
child, with little promise of that remarkable physical <lb/>
development, great endurance in performing herculean <lb/>
labours, and intense strength, which she subsequently <lb/>
attained. On account of her health she was not allowed <lb/>
to do lessons regularly like other children; but though <lb/>
left to follow her bent with less restraint and discipline <lb/>
than fell to the lot of the elder children of the <reg orig="house-|hold">household</reg>, <lb/>
still the atmosphere of good breeding and the <lb/>
<pb n="252" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0269"/>
natural exuberance of youthful gaiety around her from <lb/>
her birth constituted educational influences of a high and <lb/>
healthy character.</p>
<p>Dora learnt instinctively, growing into habits of minute <lb/>
observation, and quietly storing up in her retentive <lb/>
memory what she saw and heard. From the very first, <lb/>
too, her strong will and indomitable perseverance were <lb/>
manifest. Her biographer<ref target="n4" n="1">*</ref>
<note id="n4" place="foot" n="1"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>"Biography of Sister Dora," by Margaret Lonsdale. &lpar;Kegan <lb/>
Paul, Paternoster Square, London.&rpar;</p></note>
 says:&mdash;</p>
<p>"If she could not get her own way easily, she did not <lb/>
give it up, or take refuge in sulks or in an outbreak of <lb/>
temper, like most children; rather the meeting with <lb/>
opposition seemed to stimulate her active mind to find <lb/>
a device for getting her way somehow." The following <lb/>
is one of her own stories in illustration of this:&mdash;</p>
<p>She and her sister had what they were pleased to <lb/>
consider extremely ugly velvet bonnets for Sunday wear. <lb/>
Complaints, however, were useless, and Dorothy set her <lb/>
brains to work to accomplish her end. One very rainy <lb/>
day the children knew that their mother had gone out <lb/>
for a long drive. Dorothy ran to her sister, and said, <lb/>
"Be quick; now's our chance of spoiling our bonnets." <lb/>
They fetched the obnoxious articles and put them on, <lb/>
threw open the library window, put their heads well out, <lb/>
and let the rain work its worst upon the velvet. Then, <lb/>
at Dora's suggestion, and not at all to hide what they <lb/>
had done, but merely to complete the operation, they <lb/>
<pb n="253" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0270"/>
put the bonnets away, soaking wet as they were, into <lb/>
their boxes. Sunday morning came: where were the <lb/>
bonnets? Dora replied firmly, "Quite spoilt; we can <lb/>
never wear them any more." They were condemned, <lb/>
however, to wear them; and not on that Sunday alone, <lb/>
but for many Sundays afterwards, they appeared in <lb/>
church with the monuments of failure upon their <lb/>
heads.</p>
<p>At fourteen she had a most serious illness, and during <lb/>
the long months of weariness and pain she seemed to be <lb/>
developing the power, so invaluable to her in later life, <lb/>
not only of bearing pain, but of always looking on the <lb/>
bright side of things. She had, too, even thus early, <lb/>
"an everlasting flow of animal spirits, bubbling over in <lb/>
fun, and a keen sense of the humorous side of things in <lb/>
general." This, together with her extraordinary <reg orig="forti-|tude">fortitude</reg>, <lb/>
stood her in good stead during her peculiarly <lb/>
active and self-sacrificing life, when she voluntarily bore <lb/>
for other's sakes burdens that would have crushed the <lb/>
majority of persons; though it sometimes caused her to <lb/>
be misunderstood by those who failed to see how closely <lb/>
her rippling laughter was allied to tenderest pity and to <lb/>
tears, its undertone of rich melody being freighted and <lb/>
vibrating with her exhaustless sympathy.</p>
<p>From this period &lpar;her fourteenth year&rpar; to her twentieth <lb/>
she rapidly grew in vigour and health, engaging in active <lb/>
outdoor exercises, so that she became noted for her skill <lb/>
in various boyish games, and was quite famous for her <lb/>
daring as a horsewoman. Her eldest brother at this <lb/>
<pb n="254" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0271"/>
time made her his frequent companion, and with him <lb/>
she studied the classics and mathematics, writing at his <lb/>
dictation, copying for him, and entering, as through her <lb/>
life it was her habit to do, with unfailing zest and ardour <lb/>
into all that she undertook. Many a time in after years, <lb/>
she delighted the hearts of her patients by stories of <lb/>
her rides across the wild Yorkshire moorlands, firing <lb/>
especially the imagination of the big boys, who, with <lb/>
their ready admiration for display of physical courage, <lb/>
were irresistibly fascinated by a woman in whom they <lb/>
saw combined resolution of body and mind.</p>
<p>Those who knew her at this period say that her <lb/>
personal beauty was very remarkable. She was tall and <lb/>
slender, about five feet seven inches in height, and <lb/>
perfectly well made. Her hands were small and <reg orig="ex-|quisitely">exquisitely</reg> <lb/>
formed; her features nearly perfect in their <lb/>
regularity, and the forehead wide and high. She had <lb/>
dark tightly-curling brown hair, waving all over her <lb/>
head, which no amount of cutting off or covering with <lb/>
caps could ever smooth; and the softness and roundness <lb/>
of youth, the extreme delicacy of her whole colouring <lb/>
and complexion, added to the liveliness of her <reg orig="expres-|sion">expression</reg>, <lb/>
made her a fascinating creature to look upon.</p>
<p>Her family were in affluent circumstances, but were <lb/>
distinguished by their devotion to the sick, the poor, and <lb/>
the suffering. It was usual among the sisters to plan <lb/>
how they could make their clothes last as long as <reg orig="pos-|sible">possible</reg>, <lb/>
how they could save from their travelling expenses, <lb/>
or how deny themselves at the table, that they might be <lb/>
<pb n="255" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0272"/>
able to give away more generously than they were able <lb/>
to without the self-denial.</p>
<p>As little children no reward could be offered them so <lb/>
great as to be permitted to perform some deed of love, <lb/>
and this feeling grew stronger in Dora. For her there <lb/>
was no pleasure in the world equal to that of service <lb/>
&mdash;the service of the sad, the suffering, the sinful and the <lb/>
repulsive. The nine years after twenty were so <reg orig="beauti-|fully">beautifully</reg> <lb/>
spent in her home that her father called her his <lb/>
"Sunshine." She faithfully attended upon her mother's <lb/>
failing strength, and watched beside her death-bed.</p>
<p>Her enthusiasm and spirit of adventure were first <lb/>
thoroughly moved by Florence Nightingale's heroic work <lb/>
during the Crimean War. She wanted to join the band <lb/>
of women who went out as nurses, and implored her <lb/>
father to let her go; but he wisely refused, telling her <lb/>
that, untrained and undisciplined as she was, she would <lb/>
be worse than useless, adding that she had enough to <lb/>
employ her at home if she would only think so.</p>
<p>But she felt that she could not be contented any <lb/>
longer at home, that a voice Divine was summoning her <lb/>
forth to labour. She felt compelled to go. To her had <lb/>
come that call which many a soul hears: "Wist ye not <lb/>
that I must be about my Father's business?" Her <lb/>
beginning was a very humble one. In October, 1861, <lb/>
Dora Patteson, in reply to an advertisement, finally <lb/>
quitted the shelter of the home-roof, and became a <lb/>
village schoolmistress in the parish of Little Woolston, <lb/>
near Bletchley, on the borders of Buckinghamshire.</p>
<pb n="256" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0273"/>
<p>Here she not only taught her children at school, but <lb/>
she followed them to their homes, nursed them when <lb/>
they were unwell, and visited their parents and others of <lb/>
the poor and sick in the village. That she might have <lb/>
the more to spare for the needy, she accustomed herself <lb/>
to do all her own household work, and the people in the <lb/>
neighbourhood were at first "astonished to find Miss <lb/>
Patteson blacking her grate when they came to see her," <lb/>
but they afterwards learned to appreciate her generous <lb/>
motives, and love her for her rare consideration. For <lb/>
three years she continued to work at Woolston under <lb/>
the vicar's direction, living in a small cottage, regardless <lb/>
of any society. But she was not altogether satisfied <lb/>
with the nature of her work, or the character of her <reg orig="sur-|roundings">surroundings</reg>.</p>
<p>Dora's loneliness in her cottage was at times disturbed, <lb/>
and on one occasion she had an unpleasant adventure <lb/>
with a burglar.</p>
<p>One day, when she happened to be at home, an <reg orig="ill-|looking">ill-looking</reg> <lb/>
man came to beg, and she noticed that he took <lb/>
a critically observant look round her little kitchen. <lb/>
That evening she went to sit up with a man in the <lb/>
village who was dangerously ill. He died in the course <lb/>
of the night, and as Dora was returning home through <lb/>
the fields, between one and two o'clock, she saw a <lb/>
bright light burning in her kitchen. She unlocked the <lb/>
door just in time to recognise the same man who had <lb/>
begged of her in the daytime, and to see him making <lb/>
his escape through the window of the adjoining room <lb/>
<pb n="257" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0274"/>
with all her small collection of silver spoons and forks <lb/>
which she had brought from home, and a teapot which <lb/>
she especially valued. She never discovered any trace <lb/>
either of the thief or of her property.</p>
<p>Having neglected a severe cold which she had taken, <lb/>
she broke down in health, and by the advice of her <lb/>
friends went to Redcar, on the Yorkshire coast, for <lb/>
change and restoration. Here, as she got better, her <lb/>
insatiable desire for work returned, and to gratify her <lb/>
taste for nursing, she entered the Sisterhood of the Good <lb/>
Samaritans, whose headquarters were at Coatham, near <lb/>
Redcar, but who were engaged in various works of <lb/>
mercy in different parts of England. Here she <reg orig="under-|went">underwent</reg> <lb/>
an exceptionally severe course of training, <reg orig="shrink-|ing">shrinking</reg> <lb/>
from no hardship, stooping to the pettiest details, <lb/>
and choosing danger and hardship rather than ease. At <lb/>
length she was sent to the small cottage hospital at <lb/>
North Ormesby, near Middlesbrough, where she worked <lb/>
sometimes alone, sometimes with other sisters who were <lb/>
in charge.</p>
<p>Early in 1865 Sister Dora was sent to Walsall, to <lb/>
help in nursing at a small cottage hospital recently <lb/>
established there, and at that period under the charge <lb/>
of the sisterhood to which she was attached.</p>
<p>Walsall then contained about 35,000 inhabitants, and <lb/>
lay on the borders of the great coal and iron district <lb/>
in South Staffordshire, called by the very expressive <lb/>
name of "The Black Country." At night the spectator <lb/>
seems to be transported into the infernal regions, where <lb/>
<pb n="258" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0275"/>
the blinding glare of blast furnaces, the snorting of <lb/>
engines, the ponderous thud of steam-hammers, and the <lb/>
clang and whiz and whirr of the machinery, sounds <lb/>
which never cease, but which are less noticed during <lb/>
the day, bewilder the senses. Little swarthy, half-naked <lb/>
pigmies &lpar;for so they appear by the side of the gigantic <lb/>
fires&rpar; come and go in the flashing light like demons <lb/>
dancing round their unquenchable flames. Forests of <lb/>
tall chimneys of every variety of shape vomit forth <lb/>
volumes of smoke and fierce tongues of flame. When <lb/>
Sister Dora commenced work in this locality the men <lb/>
were described as many of them professing no religious <lb/>
belief whatsoever, and the women as leading hard lives <lb/>
of drudgery, drunkenness and immorality being scarcely <lb/>
looked upon as a disgrace.</p>
<p>Here, then, Dora set to work with characteristic <lb/>
energy, and early caught small-pox from the patients; <lb/>
but even in her delirium she showed the bent of her <lb/>
mind by occupying herself in tearing up her sheets into <lb/>
bandages. At this time the Walsall people were not <lb/>
only suspicious of the sisters, erroneously supposing <lb/>
them to be members of a Roman Catholic institution, <lb/>
but actually persecuted them with such material <reg orig="argu-|ments">arguments</reg> <lb/>
as stones and mud. Their patience and <reg orig="tender-|ness">tenderness</reg> <lb/>
at length, however, began to bear fruit, and almost <lb/>
the last instance of active opposition fell upon Sister <lb/>
Dora. This is the story as related by her biographer:&mdash;</p>
<p>"At the time of the celebrated Murphy riots Dora <lb/>
was walking, rather late one evening, through the town <lb/>
<pb n="259" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0276"/>
to visit a patient, when a lad from the other side of <lb/>
the road called out, <hi rend="italic">'There goes one of those sisters of <lb/>
misery!'</hi> and threw a stone which <hi rend="italic">cut open her forehead.</hi> <lb/>
Not long afterwards this same young fellow was brought <lb/>
into the hospital, having met with a severe injury in a <lb/>
coal-pit. Sister Dora, who never forgot a face, <reg orig="recog-|nised">recognised</reg> <lb/>
him at once, saying to herself, 'That's my man.' <lb/>
He was some time under her care, and she bestowed <lb/>
upon him probably more than usual attention. One <lb/>
night, when he was recovering, she found him quietly <lb/>
crying. 'I wouldn't ask him what was the matter,' <lb/>
Sister Dora said, when relating the incident, 'because <lb/>
I knew well enough, and I wanted him to confess.' <lb/>
At length it came out, with many sobs, 'Sister, <hi rend="italic">I</hi> threw <lb/>
that stone at you.' 'Oh,' she replied, 'did you think <lb/>
I did not know that? Why, I knew you the very first <lb/>
minute you came in at the door.' 'What!' he <reg orig="ex-|claimed">exclaimed</reg>, <lb/>
'you knew me, and have been nursing me <lb/>
like this?' It was his first practical experience of good <lb/>
returned for evil, and he did not know what to make <lb/>
of it."</p>
<p>She was regarded by the rough men who occupied <lb/>
the wards from time to time as an angel of light, and <lb/>
if it was possible she would always give them their tea <lb/>
with her own hand. Who could ask with such real <lb/>
anxiety and tenderness after their pain, and how they <lb/>
had been bearing it? A question which not a few of <lb/>
them shrank from answering. "Oh, I am sorry for <lb/>
you; I wish I could bear it for you, I'm sure," was the <lb/>
<pb n="260" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0277"/>
comforting speech addressed to one groaning sufferer. <lb/>
To another she would say, "Now don't you be making <lb/>
a fuss, you're not so very bad; tea will cure <hi rend="italic">you</hi>"; while <lb/>
the ward resounded with, "Sister, come and look at <lb/>
my leg;" "Sister, my back do ache;" and so on, all in <lb/>
the hope of getting attention from Sister Dora.</p>
<p>"Here," says the <hi rend="italic">Christian Herald</hi>, in an excellent <lb/>
outline of Miss Lonsdale's charming Biography, "she <lb/>
evidently found the 'enlarged sphere' for which she had <lb/>
so long pined. She used every opportunity for <reg orig="increas-|ing">increasing</reg> <lb/>
her knowledge of dressing wounds and surgery, and <lb/>
adding to her skill in the arts of healing. She went her <lb/>
way so noiselessly and undemonstratively that it was not <lb/>
until she was again prostrated by illness, through <reg orig="ne-|glecting">neglecting</reg> <lb/>
to change her wet clothes, that 'the real value <lb/>
of her services was discovered.' In process of time the <lb/>
hospital was removed to a healthier situation, and <reg orig="en-|larged">enlarged</reg> <lb/>
in a manner corresponding to its needs. Sister <lb/>
Dora was placed in charge of the new building, and its <lb/>
internal organization was entrusted to her.</p>
<p>"A few years later, in 1874, the Good Samaritan <lb/>
Sisterhood surrendered all official relationship with the <lb/>
work, and Sister Dora finally severed her own connection <lb/>
with them, remaining under the Walsall Town Committee. <lb/>
The kind of rule she exercised could only be justified <lb/>
by its results. Amidst admirable qualities, there was <lb/>
sometimes a measure of self-assertion, a jealousy of <lb/>
subordinate aid, a brusqueness of direction, unworthy of <lb/>
her high aims. These defects in one less capable might <lb/>
<pb n="261" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0278"/>
have wrought disastrously, but perhaps in some aspects <lb/>
give even a heightened interest in her life-story. One <lb/>
feels instinctively that she is no 'saint'; but while <reg orig="un-|questionably">unquestionably</reg> <lb/>
one of the most devoted workers the age <lb/>
has seen, intensely human in her failures no less than <lb/>
her triumphs&mdash;a fellow-pilgrim heavenward of like <reg orig="pas-|sions">passions</reg> <lb/>
with ourselves."</p>
<p>Her powers of endurance seemed wonderful. After <lb/>
her hospital work was over she would start out to visit <lb/>
loathsome alleys. Occasionally she sat up whole nights <lb/>
with dying patients, for whom it was considered useless <lb/>
to do anything, and who were therefore deserted by their <lb/>
friends. One night she was sent for by a poor man who <lb/>
was much attached to her and who was dying of what <lb/>
was called "black pox," a virulent form of small-pox. <lb/>
She went, and found him dying. Only a neighbour was <lb/>
with him. But a small piece of candle was left, and <lb/>
she therefore gave the woman money, and begged her <lb/>
to hasten back with lights. She went, but never <reg orig="re-|turned">returned</reg>.</p>
<p>After a little while the dying man raised himself up <lb/>
in bed with a last effort, saying, "Sister, kiss me before <lb/>
I die!"</p>
<p>She took him, all covered as he was with the loathsome <lb/>
disease, into her arms, and kissed him, the candle going <lb/>
out almost as she did so, leaving them in total darkness. <lb/>
He begged to be held, and she sat on thus with him in <lb/>
her arms till he died, and then in the early dawn groped <lb/>
her way out for assistance.</p>
<pb n="262" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0279"/>
<p>She was accustomed imprudently to boast that she <lb/>
could always sit in her wet clothes without harm, and <lb/>
she certainly did this for a long time with apparent <reg orig="im-|punity">impunity</reg>. <lb/>
"She used to come home wet through and <lb/>
hot with hurrying along the streets, to find a crowd of <lb/>
out-patients awaiting her return. Her own clothes <lb/>
were constantly forgotten and allowed to dry upon her." <lb/>
Amidst it all <hi rend="italic">she never lost her patience or cheerfulness.</hi> <lb/>
She would invent games for the boys to play together, <lb/>
and happy the man or boy who could catch her for a <lb/>
game of chess or draughts. "If I could not laugh over <lb/>
the things, I don't know what I should do," she would <lb/>
say.</p>
<p>She was <hi rend="italic">very tender towards little children</hi>, and had <lb/>
great success in quieting them when fretful and soothing <lb/>
them when in pain.</p>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">"Don't cry; sister's got you</hi>," she would say <lb/>
to a struggling babe, carrying it safely in her right <lb/>
arm, while going about doing needed work with her <lb/>
other hand. And presently the little one would yield <lb/>
to the magnetism of her gentleness, and go off into a <lb/>
happy sleep. Once <hi rend="italic">a child of nine</hi>, dreadfully burned, <lb/>
but past the period of feeling pain, was brought to the <lb/>
hospital. The extreme exhaustion of approaching death <lb/>
frightened the child, and Sister Dora sat down by her, <lb/>
and talked to her about the Saviour and the bright home <lb/>
she was going to so soon, till the terror was exorcised, <lb/>
and a smile of content wreathed the pallid lips. <hi rend="italic">"When <lb/>
you come to heaven, Sister, I'll meet you at the gates with</hi> <lb/>
<pb n="263" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0280"/>
<hi rend="italic">a bunch of flowers</hi>," were the little girl's last words, her <lb/>
eyes resting, no doubt, on the flowers which Sister Dora <lb/>
always kept within sight for the comfort and cheer of her <lb/>
patients.</p>
<p>As regards those who were the objects of her solicitude, <lb/>
she took pains to let them see that she cared for them <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">individually</hi>, telling them that <hi rend="italic">she prayed for them one by <lb/>
one</hi>, and that when they went out from under her care <lb/>
she would not forget them. After all, is not this the true <lb/>
spirit of all really enduring Christian work? She once <lb/>
told a friend that she often cried&mdash;she, the bright-faced <lb/>
sister with the cheery word and the hearty laugh that <lb/>
were so contagious in the dreary wards&mdash;yes, actually <lb/>
cried when she went to bed at night, to think how many <lb/>
good words she <hi rend="italic">might</hi> have spoken more than she had <lb/>
done during the ceaseless and wearing labours of the <lb/>
day!</p>
<p>She tried generally to invent some queer nickname for <lb/>
each of her patients, in order that they might &lpar;as she <lb/>
said&rpar; the sooner forget their former lives and <reg orig="associa-|tions">associations</reg>, <lb/>
if those had been bad. Thus one man would <lb/>
always be spoken of as "King Charles" &lpar;even having it <lb/>
written upon his egg for breakfast&rpar;, because his face <reg orig="sug-|gested">suggested</reg> <lb/>
Charles the First to Sister Dora. "Darkey," and <lb/>
"Cockney," and "Pat," and "Stumpy," would answer <lb/>
to no other names. Rude, rough fellows, of course, <lb/>
constantly came in; nobody had ever seen such a <lb/>
woman as this before; so beautiful, so good, so full of fun <lb/>
and humour, and of sympathy for broken hearts, as well <lb/>
<pb n="264" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0281"/>
as for every other kind of fracture, and the best friend <lb/>
that many of these poor maimed men had ever known. <lb/>
She was the personification of goodness and <reg orig="unselfish-|ness">unselfishness</reg> <lb/>
to them; skilful and rapid in her work,&mdash;a great <lb/>
matter where wounds are concerned, and in a place <lb/>
where there was much to be done and few people to <lb/>
do it.</p>
<p>After the patients' supper had been served <hi rend="italic">she read <lb/>
prayers always</hi>, even when, as sometimes happened, her <lb/>
many duties and labours had so delayed her that most <lb/>
of the patients were asleep, for she said, <hi rend="italic">"The prayers go <lb/>
up for them all the same</hi>." She spoke unreservedly to <lb/>
her household upon the absolute necessity of <hi rend="italic">constant <lb/>
private prayer</hi>, and thought no real blessing could attend <lb/>
the hospital unless those who worked in it fulfilled their <lb/>
duty in this respect. It is said of her that so unflinching <lb/>
was her faith in the <hi rend="italic">efficacy of prayer</hi> that she never <lb/>
touched a wound without lifting up her heart to the <lb/>
Giver of all virtue, and asking that healing might be <reg orig="con-|veyed">conveyed</reg> <lb/>
by her means; and never set a fracture without <lb/>
a prayer that, through her instrumentality, the limb <lb/>
might unite. As she attended upon the surgeons during <lb/>
an operation, the most absorbing and anxious of a <lb/>
nurse's duties, she was engaged in communion with Him <lb/>
in whose hands are the issues of life and death.</p>
<p>As years passed on she became able almost to fulfil <lb/>
the Apostle's command, "Pray without ceasing." But <lb/>
the striking feature of her prayers was the strong faith <lb/>
which animated them. She did not pray because it was <lb/>
<pb n="265" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0282"/>
her duty, or even because she wished to fit herself to <lb/>
hold communion with God hereafter, but because she <lb/>
believed that everything she asked for would be granted <lb/>
to her. She firmly held to the supernatural power put <lb/>
into the hands of men by means of the weapon of prayer, <lb/>
and the practical faithlessness in this respect of the world <lb/>
at large was an ever-increasing source of surprise and <lb/>
distress to her. The thought of the lives led by most <lb/>
of those who were brought into the hospital weighed <lb/>
heavily upon her mind, especially if, as was frequently <lb/>
the case, they were insensible from an accident, and <lb/>
never likely to recover consciousness.</p>
<p>"Well," she would say, "we must pray;" and at <lb/>
night, when the ward was quiet, she might often be seen <lb/>
kneeling by the bed of some such sufferer. "These <lb/>
patients are my crosses," she would continue; "there <lb/>
seems so little hope to bear one up." Her old servant <lb/>
who slept in the next room to her mistress, used often to <lb/>
hear her praying aloud for hours at night.</p>
<p>The little small-pox ambulance, in the shape of an <lb/>
omnibus, was only too well-known at one time in the <lb/>
streets of Walsall. During an epidemic one or more <lb/>
patients could be placed on the floor of the carriage in <lb/>
their beds, while by their side sat Sister Dora. When <lb/>
people refused from prejudice to send their patients <lb/>
to the hospital, she would go in the ambulance and <lb/>
announce that she had "come to fetch So-and-so," and, <lb/>
if further difficulty was made, <hi rend="italic">she would take up the man <lb/>
or woman in her arms</hi>, as easily as if the burden had <lb/>
<pb n="266" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0283"/>
been a baby, and lift it into her omnibus, while the <lb/>
friends very rarely interfered to prevent her.</p>
<p>There is a place in Walsall well-known to the police, <lb/>
called Marsh Lane, which is infamous on many accounts, <lb/>
but chiefly as the scene of Irish fights. One night, <lb/>
Sister Dora passed the entrance to this lane, and <reg orig="plung-|ing">plunging</reg> <lb/>
through the crowd, which made way for her right <lb/>
and left, she took possession of a high door-step, where <lb/>
her appearance gained for her the attention she desired. <lb/>
She addressed the crowd in her usual fashion, flinging <lb/>
well-aimed raillery at the combatants. They stood for <lb/>
a moment or two abashed, like two furious bull-dogs, <lb/>
and then, with the tenacity of the same creatures, again <lb/>
rushed on each other, urged on by the cries of the crowd. <lb/>
In one moment she had thrown herself between the wild <lb/>
men, holding them each back with an arm which either <lb/>
of the men could have broken as easily as he could <lb/>
have snapped his tobacco-pipe. Her appeal was <reg orig="all-|powerful">all-powerful</reg>; <lb/>
they allowed her to win the day and the <lb/>
fight was at an end.</p>
<p>It was Sister Dora's custom, during the latter months <lb/>
of her work, to drive to Sutton, about seven miles from <lb/>
Walsall, in a little pony carriage. She was always driven <lb/>
on these occasions by the porter of the hospital. Twice <lb/>
on the road she and her companion were attacked by <lb/>
men who evidently had evil intentions. Once, just as <lb/>
they were entering Sutton, two ruffians sprang out of a <lb/>
hedge, but a man on horseback appearing just at the <lb/>
moment, the men fled. Shortly after this they were <lb/>
<pb n="267" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0284"/>
driving more slowly than usual one dark night, when a <lb/>
man suddenly rushed across the road and ran after the <lb/>
carriage. The porter whipped up the pony, and Sister <lb/>
Dora, turning round, saw that the man had a large stick <lb/>
in his hand. "I had only time," she said, "for a short <lb/>
prayer, when the stick was brought down heavily on the <lb/>
back of the carriage. I had leant instinctively to one <lb/>
side as I said my prayer, and <hi rend="italic">thus</hi> my head escaped the <lb/>
blow which was intended for it." The man who made <lb/>
the attack <hi rend="italic">did not know</hi> that it was Sister Dora who was <lb/>
in the carriage.</p>
<p>For fifteen years Sister Dora continued her labours <lb/>
with strong will and unflagging energy, the constraining <lb/>
power through all being love to Christ and a tender <lb/>
yearning for the erring and the suffering, but at last <lb/>
her own strength began to fail. This was in 1877. <lb/>
She consulted a confidential surgeon, and found that <lb/>
a complaint had set in which must ultimately end <lb/>
her life, involving great pain and admitting of no cure. <lb/>
She was determined to keep this a profound secret <lb/>
from all but herself and her doctor. For nearly <lb/>
twenty months she continued to go about her duties <lb/>
as usual, spending the night by the bedside of wretched <lb/>
dying patients, soothing, exhorting, encouraging, going <lb/>
almost down with them into the dark valley of the <lb/>
shadow of death. She was sometimes fearful, perhaps <lb/>
not without reason, lest they should cling too exclusively <lb/>
to her and to the human support which she afforded <lb/>
them. Yet her religion was eminently spiritual. To <lb/>
<pb n="268" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0285"/>
one who tried to follow her she gave the wholesome <lb/>
advice: "When you want to lead any one to Jesus, <lb/>
remember, you must point, and take care not to stand <lb/>
in the way yourself."</p>
<p>"Sister Dora was once travelling as usual third <lb/>
class, when a number of half-drunken navvies got in <lb/>
after her, and before she could change her carriage <lb/>
the train was in motion. She recollected that her dress, <lb/>
a black gown and cloak, with a quiet black bonnet <lb/>
and veil, would probably, as on former encounters <lb/>
with half-intoxicated men, protect her from insult. <lb/>
Her fellow-travellers began to talk, and at last one of <lb/>
them swore several blasphemous oaths. Sister Dora's <lb/>
whole soul burnt within her, and she thought, 'Shall <lb/>
I sit and hear this?' but then came the reflection, <lb/>
'What will they do to me if I interfere?' and this <lb/>
dread kept her quiet a moment or two longer. But <lb/>
the language became more and more violent, and it <lb/>
passed through her mind, 'What must these men think <lb/>
of any woman who can sit by and hear such words <lb/>
unmoved; but, above all, what will they think of a <lb/>
woman in my dress who is afraid to speak to them?'</p>
<p>"At once she stood up her full height in the carriage, <lb/>
and called out loudly, 'I will not hear the Master <lb/>
whom I serve spoken of in this way.' Immediately <lb/>
they dragged her down into her seat, with a torrent <lb/>
of oaths, and one of the most violent roared, 'Hold <lb/>
your jaw, you fool; do you want your face smashed <lb/>
in?' They held her down on the seat between them; <lb/>
<pb n="269" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0286"/>
nor did she attempt to struggle, satisfied with having <lb/>
made her open protest. At the next station they let <lb/>
her go, and she quickly got out of the carriage. A <lb/>
minute after, while she was standing on the platform, <lb/>
she heard a rough voice behind her, 'Shake hands, <lb/>
mum! you're a good-plucked one, you are! You were <lb/>
right and we were wrong.' She gave her hand to the <lb/>
man, who hurried away, for fear, no doubt, that his <lb/>
comrades should jeer at him."</p>
<p>All that's bright must fade. "All flesh is grass, and <lb/>
all the beauty thereof as but the flower of the field." <lb/>
And so with Sister Dora, from whom we take sorrowful <lb/>
leave by relating her last illness and death.</p>
<p>When the hospital was closed for a time, while a <lb/>
new building was erected, Dora went first to stay with <lb/>
her relations, and then to London and to Paris to <lb/>
see some new surgical appliances. But at last, in <lb/>
October, 1878, she broke down entirely. She went <lb/>
to Birmingham to see her doctor, and was taken so <lb/>
ill <hi rend="italic">there</hi> that she was supposed to be dying; but she <lb/>
insisted on being removed to Walsall to die among <lb/>
her people. "The committee of the hospital engaged <lb/>
a small house for her, the new building being not <lb/>
quite ready, but from the time she went she never <lb/>
left her bed. The hospital was opened in her name, but <lb/>
alas! she never saw it. Her old servant came to nurse <lb/>
her, and to her she was obliged to reveal the hopeless <lb/>
state she was in; but she kept it from others as long <lb/>
as she could, and would not allow even her loving sisters <lb/>
<pb n="270" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0287"/>
to come and tend her, in spite of their grief and <lb/>
entreaties.</p>
<p>She bore her intense sufferings heroically and <reg orig="resign-|edly">resignedly</reg>. <lb/>
They were days of mental darkness and <reg orig="de-|pression">depression</reg>, <lb/>
as well as bodily pain. "I cannot pray; I <lb/>
cannot think. I sadly fear I shall be lost; I can only <lb/>
trust." But she triumphed at last by faith in a personal <lb/>
Saviour. During the paroxysms of pain she feared her <lb/>
faith might give way, and so had set up before her a <lb/>
crucifix, that she might constantly be reminded of her <lb/>
Saviour's greater sufferings. This fact shows more <lb/>
than anything else the nature of the semi-darkness <lb/>
through which she had passed in spiritual matters: <lb/>
but if her whole life's labour and dying hours mean <lb/>
anything they surely mean that she simply trusted in <lb/>
Christ without the intervention of either priest or <lb/>
crucifix.</p>
<p>In one of her letters she says: "I have not had two <lb/>
hours' sleep for four days and nights, but in the midst <lb/>
of the fiery furnace there was a form like unto the <lb/>
Son of Man." "If I went back to teach patients <lb/>
again," she said, when nearing her end, "I should <lb/>
dwell more than ever on the necessity of building our <lb/>
hopes on Jesus only." The cabmen of the town had <lb/>
assembled in a mission-room at her request, and the <lb/>
clergyman who was going to address them was with <lb/>
her. "Oh, speak to them," she said, "on this text, <lb/>
&mdash;'What think ye of Christ?' Make it ring in their <lb/>
ears."</p>
<pb n="271" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0288"/>
<p>On Saturday, December 21st, 1878, it became evident <lb/>
that the end was really drawing near. Sister Dora's <lb/>
depression now seemed greater than before, and a <lb/>
dread, amounting to horror, of the last pangs of death <lb/>
came upon her. Her coughing was incessant. At <lb/>
times all was loneliness and darkness; but still the <lb/>
faith in which her life had been passed stood her in <lb/>
such good stead that one of her nurses, who had <lb/>
watched many death-beds, testified, "I <hi rend="italic">never</hi> saw such <lb/>
faith and patience." She anticipated a welcome from <lb/>
those souls whom she had herself led to God, and the <lb/>
idea comforted her. Repeatedly she exclaimed "Oh, <lb/>
I hope I shall sing my Christmas carol in heaven!"</p>
<p>On the morning of the 24th, she said, cheerfully, <lb/>
"I am dying; run for Sister Ellen!" Meanwhile, an <lb/>
old companion tried to soothe her, saying, "Our blessed <lb/>
Lord is standing at the gates of Heaven to open them <lb/>
for you." But she no longer needed such consolation, <lb/>
for all her darkness was dissipated by the gathering <lb/>
glory-cloud, and she answered, "I see Him there, the <lb/>
gates are opened wide." At two o'clock in the afternoon <lb/>
she was at rest.</p>
<p>Almost the whole population of Walsall came to her <lb/>
funeral, many rough workmen weeping like children at <lb/>
the grave. She has left a memory which will not soon <lb/>
fade, of being a true and noble worker for God and <lb/>
man.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> name of Mrs. Eleanor Fisher is a household <lb/>
word among many of the young female toilers of <lb/>
our great metropolis. In her we have an illustration of <lb/>
the great truth that prayerful and persistent endeavour is <lb/>
sure, sooner or later, to result in a rich reward. And <lb/>
never in the chequered history of the Christian Church <lb/>
and of philanthropic enterprise has the necessity for <lb/>
woman's co-operation been more plainly evident than it <lb/>
is to-day.</p>
<q><lg type="stanza">
<l>"Prayer is the Christian's vital breath,</l>
<l rend="indent">The Christian's native air;</l>
<l>His watchword at the gates of death,</l>
<l rend="indent">He enters heaven with prayer.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>Prayer is the simplest form of speech</l>
<l rend="indent">That infant lips can try;</l>
<l>Prayer the sublimest strains that reach</l>
<l rend="indent">The Majesty on high."</l>
</lg></q>
<p>Prayer is a constant source of invigoration to <reg orig="self-|discipline">self-discipline</reg>; <lb/>
not the thoughtless praying which is a thing <lb/>
<pb n="273" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0290"/>
of custom, but that which is sincere, intense, watchful. <lb/>
Let a man ask himself, whether he really would have the <lb/>
thing he prays for; let him think, while he is praying <lb/>
for a spirit of forgiveness, whether, even at that moment, <lb/>
he is disposed to give up the luxury of anger. If not, <lb/>
what a horrible mockery it is, to think that a man can <lb/>
find nothing better to do in the presence of his Creator <lb/>
than telling off so many words alone with his God, and <lb/>
repeating a task like a child, longing to get rid of it, and <lb/>
indifferent to its meaning!</p>
<p>Not so does the subject of this memoir pray, otherwise <lb/>
she never would have achieved the Christian object of <lb/>
her heart, and drawn so many young women from their <lb/>
frivolity to a higher life. Our great poet, Tennyson, says <lb/>
on the benefits of prayer:&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l rend="indent">"More things are wrought by prayer</l>
<l>Than this world dreams of. Wherefore let thy voice</l>
<l>Rise like a fountain for me night and day;</l>
<l>For what are men better than sheep or goats,</l>
<l>That nourish a blind life within the brain,</l>
<l>If, knowing God, they lift not hands of prayer,</l>
<l>Both for themselves and those who call them friend?</l>
<l>For so the whole round world is every way</l>
<l>Bound by gold chains about the feet of God."</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>"The growing agencies for human enlightenment and <lb/>
amelioration," says the <hi rend="italic">Christian Herald</hi>, in speaking of <lb/>
Mrs. Fisher's religious endeavours, "which derive their <lb/>
impetus from the Cross of Christ, imperatively demand, <lb/>
in all our large centres of populous activity, especially in <lb/>
the many-millioned city of London, the cheerful aid of <lb/>
<pb n="274" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0291"/>
Joannas who will minister to the Lord's work of their <lb/>
substance, and of Ph&oelig;bes, and Tryphenas and <reg orig="Trypho-|sas">Tryphosas</reg> <lb/>
who will labour much in the Redeemer's cause. The <lb/>
most potent agents in nature are the most simple and <lb/>
noiseless, yet they are in constant and mighty <reg orig="opera-|tion">operation</reg>."</p>
<p>We gather from the notice referred to, that Mrs. <lb/>
Fisher is between forty and fifty years of age; and though <lb/>
brought up and surrounded by all the tender solicitudes <lb/>
of a quiet country parsonage in Rutlandshire, it was not <lb/>
until after she had passed her twentieth birthday that <lb/>
she became practically acquainted with her need of a <lb/>
Saviour.</p>
<p>With the verbal teachings of Scripture she was familiar; <lb/>
but it was not until after twenty years of her sunny <lb/>
girlhood's days had vanished into the irrevocable past, <lb/>
that she gave her heart unreservedly to God; and ever <lb/>
since, as opportunity and strength have permitted, she <lb/>
has endeavoured to lead others into the ways of <reg orig="ever-|lasting">everlasting</reg> <lb/>
peace.</p>
<p>She has regularly attended the Central Noonday <lb/>
Prayer Meeting at 165, Aldersgate Street, London, ever <lb/>
since the year 1867; but about four years ago she was <lb/>
deeply impressed with the thought of the great <reg orig="tempta-|tions">temptations</reg> <lb/>
and moral dangers to which the young women <lb/>
employed in the city warehouses were exposed.</p>
<p>And the fact is an appalling one, that, in the City of <lb/>
London alone, no fewer than 40,000 of this class are <lb/>
daily employed in the various shops, workrooms, and <lb/>
<pb n="275" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0292"/>
warehouses. Some are engaged in bonnet, mantle, and <lb/>
dressmaking, envelope and book-folding, gold and silver <lb/>
embroidery, cigar making, and in the manufacture of <lb/>
flowers, and in all sorts of handicraft.</p>
<p>Mrs. Fisher's desire for their welfare deepened with <lb/>
her matured reflections, and her heart yearned to attempt <lb/>
to do them good. Hitherto she had employed her <lb/>
energy in connection with mothers' meetings and <reg orig="insti-|tutions">institutions</reg> <lb/>
of a similar character; but here was clearly a call <lb/>
from her Divine Master to strike out a new path of <lb/>
service for His name's sake.</p>
<p>She asked the Lord what she could do to teach the <lb/>
numerous and interesting subjects of her loving desires. <lb/>
She at length determined that it was advisable to <reg orig="en-|deavour">endeavour</reg> <lb/>
to issue an invitation to a special meeting at a <lb/>
convenient time; and finding that an hour was allowed <lb/>
daily for dinner, she resolved upon having printed and <lb/>
issued a circular, giving a hearty invitation to all who <lb/>
could come, to a service expressly and absolutely for <lb/>
them.</p>
<p>Mrs. Fisher herself then set forth with her notes of <lb/>
invitation, and visited a considerable number of streets, <lb/>
entering the warehouses, and soliciting permission to visit <lb/>
the workrooms. From the very first her laudable <reg orig="under-|taking">undertaking</reg> <lb/>
prospered. The various employers showed <lb/>
towards her invariable courtesy and consideration, and <lb/>
furnished many expressions of cordial sympathy. Even <lb/>
where admission was refused, the circulars were received <lb/>
with a promise that they should be properly distributed.</p>
<pb n="276" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0293"/>
<p>The first meeting at length took place; and though <lb/>
only three young women attended, one of them was <lb/>
deeply impressed by a few earnest kindly words which <lb/>
Mrs. Fisher addressed to her. This young woman has <lb/>
since helped Mrs. Fisher in her good work by inducing <lb/>
many others to attend the meetings. Since that <reg orig="me-|morable">memorable</reg> <lb/>
day, four years ago, the numbers have been <lb/>
steadily increasing, and the results of the object have <lb/>
been most gratifying.</p>
<p>Mrs. Fisher has now the names and addresses of 2,000 <lb/>
young women who more or less frequently attend the <lb/>
dinner-hour prayer meetings held every day between one <lb/>
and two o'clock, at 165, Aldersgate Street, in the same <lb/>
hall as the Central Noonday Prayer Meeting is held in <lb/>
from twelve to one. Upwards of a hundred have, within <lb/>
the last month, joined the "Bible and Prayer Union." <lb/>
A Bible-woman has been regularly employed during the <lb/>
past six months, and this valuable helper has obtained <lb/>
free access to many of the warehouses. She conducts <lb/>
also an evening prayer-meeting for the young Christians, <lb/>
where they pour out their hearts one after another in <lb/>
prayer. There is also a letter mission, which personally <lb/>
addresses 2,000 girls on their birthdays with the Gospel <lb/>
message. This part of the work is highly valued, and <lb/>
the letters are anxiously awaited and most carefully <lb/>
treasured. It is likewise a means of opening up <reg orig="cor-|respondence">correspondence</reg> <lb/>
with many who may be in difficulty and <lb/>
sorrow.</p>
<p>"Why," asks the <hi rend="italic">Christian Herald</hi>, "should not a <lb/>
<pb n="277" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0294"/>
similar work be carried on by ladies in other parts of <lb/>
London, and other towns and cities, such as Liverpool, <lb/>
Manchester, Birmingham, Luton, Glasgow, Edinburgh, <lb/>
etc.?"</p>
<p>Mrs. Fisher has already worked the institution up <lb/>
into some importance, and only needs money and <reg orig="per-|sonal">personal</reg> <lb/>
help to extend its usefulness. She has fought <lb/>
bravely and prayerfully in the Christian cause; and we <lb/>
are sure her desires will be answered for further <reg orig="use-|fulness">usefulness</reg> <lb/>
in the Noonday Prayer Meetings with City young <lb/>
women. Her present need is greatly felt for a few <lb/>
devoted Christian ladies to assist her in her good work, <lb/>
either to play the harmonium or to speak a few words <lb/>
of sympathy and welcome to individual young women. <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l rend="indent">"God hath sown</l>
<l>Sweet seeds within us, seeds of sympathy,</l>
<l>Whose buds are virtues, such as bloom for heaven."</l>
</lg></q>
Sympathy is an angel of comfort when hope has fled; it <lb/>
soothes us in sorrow, and gives a zest to our joy. A <lb/>
word of sympathy is a seed which, even when dropped <lb/>
by chance, springs up a flower. Sympathy is the surest <lb/>
way to reach the human heart; it makes sunshine <lb/>
wherever it goes, and brings forth golden treasures. It <lb/>
cheers the fallen, encourages the virtuous, and looks <lb/>
with true charity on the extremely unfortunate; it is the <lb/>
real law of life, the link that connects earth with heaven, <lb/>
and all it touches it turns to gold, wherewith we purchase <lb/>
contentment, peace, and love.</p>
<pb n="278" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0295"/>
<p>Mrs. Fisher well knows the power of sympathy in her <lb/>
experiences with the 2,000 young women at Aldersgate <lb/>
Street; and with the power of religion and sympathy she <lb/>
is sustained in carrying on work which shall last for <lb/>
ever.</p>

&lsqb;<hi rend="small-caps">methodist missionary to eastern africa.</hi>&rsqb;</head>
<figure id="f25" rend="block" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0296"/>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">This</hi> devout and devoted Missionary was the <reg orig="affec-|tionate">affectionate</reg> <lb/>
wife of the Rev. T. Wakefield, now labouring <lb/>
at Rib&eacute;, a Mission station about 100 miles from Zanzibar, <lb/>
sustained by the United Methodist Free Churches in <lb/>
this country. Mrs. Wakefield was the child of pious <lb/>
Methodist parents. Her birthplace and early home was <lb/>
Mountsorrel, in Leicestershire, where once was a strong <lb/>
castle of the Earl of Leicester, and where, in the Wesleyan <lb/>
Reform chapel, on the 27th of October, 1857, she decided <lb/>
for Christ, after the manner of her fathers, by going <lb/>
forward as a seeker of salvation, and kneeling as a <lb/>
penitent, and was at once happy by believing on Jesus.</p>
<p>Mountsorrel, not long afterwards, sent as a Missionary <lb/>
to Ceylon her neighbour and intimate friend, Mr. John <lb/>
Mitchell; and after his establishment in his missionary <lb/>
work he sought and obtained Miss Brewin's consent to <lb/>
become his wife. For two years and a half she <reg orig="antici-|pated">anticipated</reg> <lb/>
a missionary life in the East Indies, when Mr. <lb/>
Mitchell fell a victim to Asiatic cholera. Her home and <lb/>
<pb n="280" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0297"/>
her labours were not to be where "spicy breezes blow <lb/>
soft o'er Ceylon's isle," but amidst the barbarous and <lb/>
degraded heathen of Eastern Africa.</p>
<p>It was in the year 1861 that the United Methodist <lb/>
Free Churches determined to send Missionaries to this <lb/>
district; and Mr. Thomas Wakefield offered himself and <lb/>
was accepted for this service. Illness compelled three <lb/>
of his companions to return home; and amid many <reg orig="hard-|ships">hardships</reg> <lb/>
he laboured alone at Rib&eacute;, the Mission station, <lb/>
until he was joined by the Rev. C. New. He returned <lb/>
to England for a brief interval in 1868, when he became <lb/>
acquainted with Mrs. Mitchell, who accompanied him as <lb/>
his wife to Africa in 1870. The voyage took place in a <lb/>
sailing-vessel of very small tonnage, and very ill-provided <lb/>
with accommodation for passengers. It was a very <reg orig="pain-|ful">painful</reg> <lb/>
and perilous journey, and Mrs. Wakefield was greatly <lb/>
exhausted by sea-sickness. The weather seems to have <lb/>
been unusually tempestuous, and the smallness of the <lb/>
cabin added greatly to the wretchedness of stormy <lb/>
nights at sea. This incident is thus interestingly <reg orig="de-|scribed">described</reg> <lb/>
in her diary, published in her brother's memoir of <lb/>
her.</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Friday, May</hi> 6<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1870.&mdash;The last night was a <reg orig="fear-|fully">fearfully</reg> <lb/>
stormy one. We got no sleep, and what was worse, <lb/>
such a tossing, shaking, bumping, and drenching, as quite <lb/>
knocked me up for to-day. The cold, too, in these <lb/>
latitudes is very severe, and all the wrappers and woollens <lb/>
I have at command are scarcely sufficient to keep me <lb/>
from a constant shiver. Exercise might alleviate this, <lb/>
<pb n="281" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0298"/>
but it is not available on a small vessel; and besides, the <lb/>
decks are very wet and slippery, and the ship is rolling <lb/>
very heavily. If I go on deck one of the sailors will say, <lb/>
'It's not fit for you to be here, mum; you'll be safer <reg orig="down-|stairs">downstairs</reg>, <lb/>
mum.' Then I go downstairs and to my berth, <lb/>
and try to get a little sleep. But all is of no use; my <lb/>
nerves will not get reconciled to this sickly see-saw, <reg orig="see-|saw">seesaw</reg> <lb/>
of what should be my resting-place. Oh for some <lb/>
solid ground to rest upon, some little spot, so small, so <lb/>
humble, so it be but firm and free from this incessant <lb/>
motion, which racks my brain and distresses my whole <lb/>
system! My husband brings me a dose of quinine, and <lb/>
I feel much better.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">"Saturday, May</hi> 7<hi rend="italic">th</hi>.&mdash;Another restless night from <lb/>
the springing and rolling of our little ship. Apart from <lb/>
this, the noises were enough to make me fancy that the <lb/>
floating abode was being demolished, its planks and <lb/>
beams creaking and groaning with a deafening sound. <lb/>
Every few minutes there was a loud crash against the <lb/>
ship's side, as if we had struck on a coral reef, or, like a <lb/>
drunken man in a narrow lane, were driving against a <lb/>
wall first on one side and then on the other. These <lb/>
sudden and entirely unexplainable explosions seemed to <lb/>
be going off with a loud crack, till we could not hear our <lb/>
own voices or that of a near neighbour without <reg orig="stretch-|ing">stretching</reg> <lb/>
the aural nerves considerably. This morning, about <lb/>
eleven o'clock, I joined Mr. Wakefield and Mr. Yates at <lb/>
the top of the cabin staircase to watch the sea. I shall <lb/>
never forget what I saw as I stood there. A strong gale <lb/>
<pb n="282" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0299"/>
of wind was blowing from the south-west, and old Ocean <lb/>
in all his pride, grandeur, and magnificence was rising. <lb/>
The waves rose first to a great height, and then, as they <lb/>
curled over, showing their proud white crests and clear <lb/>
blue transparency beneath, suddenly sank into a deep <lb/>
valley which stretched for a long distance to right and <lb/>
left of us. Then, immediately before us, rose a <reg orig="mountain-|like">mountain-like</reg> <lb/>
wave, over which it seemed impossible that the <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Emily</hi> could ride; but, bravo! over she goes with a toss <lb/>
of her head, and down we sweep on the other side, only, <lb/>
as it seemed, inevitably, to be swallowed in the jaws of <lb/>
the deep. Then we were amused by a large boiling wave <lb/>
rolling up to the side of the ship and splashing itself on <lb/>
to the decks, hiding from our view for a moment one of <lb/>
the sailors, and in not a solitary instance one of the <lb/>
cabin passengers, to the no small diversion of those who <lb/>
escaped the drenching. The decks were, of course, <lb/>
flooded; and as the water rushed from side to side of <lb/>
the ship, it sometimes threw down the sailors, who, during <lb/>
this squall, were very busy in hauling ropes and altering <lb/>
the sails at the command of the captain, who, whatever <lb/>
the weather, is always at his post.</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Sunday, May</hi> 8<hi rend="italic">th</hi>.&mdash;If on Friday night we were <lb/>
tossed to and fro by every wind and tempest, what shall <lb/>
I say of the one we have just spent? Language utterly <lb/>
fails to give a landsman a true idea of the extreme <lb/>
wretchedness of a stormy night at sea, with not a moment's <lb/>
true repose. Every now and then we were startled by a <lb/>
rush of angry waters down the cabin staircase and into <lb/>
<pb n="283" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0300"/>
our berth under the door, gurgling and splashing from <lb/>
side to side of our little room as though bent on finding <lb/>
us some amusement and entertainment during the <reg orig="any-|thing">anything</reg> <lb/>
but 'silent' watches of the night. The captain <lb/>
told us that many times during the night the sides of the <lb/>
ship were lying on the sea, and that she sped through the <lb/>
water at eleven or twelve knots an hour, and tried the <lb/>
strength of her timbers to the very utmost extent. This <lb/>
was a strange Sunday to us. Indeed, a greater contrast <lb/>
to Sabbaths at home I could scarcely imagine. We <lb/>
naturally put on Sunday attire, but nothing else around <lb/>
us marked the Sabbath's dawn. Many times during the <lb/>
day did one of the seamen come down into the cabin to <lb/>
bale and mop up the water which came rushing down the <lb/>
stairs like a cataract, and making quite as much noise. <lb/>
Our garments were dripping with water as we sat or stood <lb/>
in the cabin; and we felt no desire to face worse <reg orig="con-|ditions">conditions</reg> <lb/>
out of doors. There was no opportunity for <reg orig="hold-|ing">holding</reg> <lb/>
our usual service. After tea in the cabin we sang a few <lb/>
hymns and tried to feel cheerful in the midst of our <reg orig="dis-|comfort">discomfort</reg>; <lb/>
but all hearts often stole away to our friends in <lb/>
England. We sat up till nearly midnight, holding firmly <lb/>
to the table to prevent ourselves from getting bruised <lb/>
heads on the one hand, and by an opposite lurch from <lb/>
being found in awkward positions half way across the <lb/>
table, which, in spite of ourselves, occurred, and caused a <lb/>
good deal of merriment. We remained thus long in the <lb/>
cabin, dreading the weary, restless hours we knew full <lb/>
well were before us. Verily our fears were well grounded. <lb/>
<pb n="284" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0301"/>
All, Mr. Wakefield included, declared they had never <lb/>
had such an experience. The storm of the previous day <lb/>
had during the night increased in fury, until I began <lb/>
seriously to think that the bulwarks of our ship would be <lb/>
stove in by the power of the waves and the heightening <lb/>
gale. The captain was on deck all night, giving orders <lb/>
in a voice that was clearly heard above the roar of the <lb/>
storm, while the excitement of our perilous position, <lb/>
joined with these things, induced a nervous feverishness <lb/>
which effectually banished all sleep from our eyes.</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Monday morning, May</hi> 9<hi rend="italic">th.</hi>&mdash;At half-past nine <lb/>
o'clock, Mr. Wakefield ventured out of our little room, <lb/>
and found Mr. Yates and the mate standing against the <lb/>
steward's pantry, finishing their breakfast of cold <reg orig="por-|ridge">porridge</reg>. <lb/>
They had tried sitting at table in the cabin, but <lb/>
'a sea' found its way through the skylight above them, <lb/>
and drove them away. The captain had retired to rest, <lb/>
and I think the steward was lighting his fire, which had <lb/>
been twice put out that morning by the bursting in of <lb/>
the waters. He had himself during the night been twice <lb/>
washed out of his berth; but, nevertheless, had braved <lb/>
it out, 'not fearing,' as he said, 'to take cold from <reg orig="sea-|water">seawater</reg>, <lb/>
though his bed was completely soaked through.' <lb/>
Mr. Wakefield got a little cold porridge for us, and we <lb/>
managed to breakfast in a rough sort of way; thankful, <lb/>
moreover, that sea-sickness had not again visited us, and <lb/>
laid us quite prostrate as before. ''Tis a long storm <lb/>
that lasts for ever,' sailors say; and now we had passed <lb/>
its height."</p>
<pb n="285" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0302"/>
<p>Their voyage from Gravesend to Zanzibar, round the <lb/>
Cape of Good Hope, lasted ninety-eight days; and on the <lb/>
2nd of June the anchor dropped in the harbour of Zanzibar. <lb/>
Here the Methodist Missionaries received a hearty <reg orig="wel-|come">welcome</reg> <lb/>
from Bishop Tozer, who had prepared the English <lb/>
Church Mission House for their reception, though unable <lb/>
himself to greet them on landing, being absent on an <lb/>
expedition to the coast. The oranges and the nice <lb/>
white bread were very refreshing after the confinement <lb/>
and weariness of the sea life; and the hospitality and <lb/>
kindness of Europeans of all classes, and of <reg orig="Moham-|medan">Mohammedan</reg> <lb/>
and Arab ladies, soothed and comforted the mind <lb/>
of Mrs. Wakefield. Dr. and Mrs. Kirk at the Consulate, <lb/>
showed them much kindness. They were introduced <lb/>
to the Sultan's prime minister, to his ladies, to the Sultan <lb/>
himself and his ladies, and took part in the ceremonies <lb/>
of Arabian etiquette.</p>
<p>The verdure, the fruits, and wild-flowers of Zanzibar <lb/>
were delightful to them; and while waiting for an <reg orig="oppor-|tunity">opportunity</reg> <lb/>
of passing onwards to the Mission station, Mrs. <lb/>
Wakefield gave birth to a little girl, to whom, as "Nellie," <lb/>
her mother's memoirs are dedicated by the author, her <lb/>
uncle. Little "Nellie" engaged no trifling attention <lb/>
as a white English baby among the Arab and Hindu <lb/>
women of the district. Worn by the climate, and <reg orig="ex-|hausted">exhausted</reg> <lb/>
by successive attacks of fever, Mrs. Wakefield <lb/>
proceeded, in January, 1871, along the coast to <reg orig="Mom-|bosa">Mombosa</reg>, <lb/>
and then inland to the station, Rib&eacute;, which was <lb/>
to be her home.</p>
<pb n="286" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0303"/>
<p>The following is her account of her arrival at the <lb/>
Mission station, Rib&eacute;:&mdash;</p>
<p>"It was about half-past eight o'clock in the evening <lb/>
when we found ourselves toiling up 'Cheetham Hill,' <lb/>
Rib&eacute;; and as we neared the Mission premises, right glad <lb/>
were we to see a light in the window; and here, faint and <lb/>
weary, we arrived at last. We were shown into the iron <lb/>
house which Messrs. New and Yates were then occupying; <lb/>
and they kindly gave up their bedroom to us for our <lb/>
use, till we could get some of the furniture unpacked, <lb/>
and put into the stone house which we are to occupy. I <lb/>
laid dear Nellie on the bed while I took off my things <lb/>
and got a wash, and at once she fell asleep and did not <lb/>
wake till morning. The next day was my first Sabbath <lb/>
here. I was too tired to go to the Sunday school, which <lb/>
begins about nine o'clock; but was ready for the <reg orig="preach-|ing">preaching</reg> <lb/>
service about an hour afterwards. All the mission <lb/>
people, men, women, and children alike, go to the <lb/>
Sunday school and then remain to the service. There <lb/>
is a short interval between the two services, at the end <lb/>
of which a bell is tolled for a minute or two to call the <lb/>
people in to the preaching. The shed used as a <reg orig="school-|room">schoolroom</reg> <lb/>
and preaching-house is immediately on the right <lb/>
of the iron house. This schoolroom is a very barn-like <lb/>
place, with a mud floor. The door is at one end of the <lb/>
building, and at the opposite end is a raised platform, <lb/>
with some forms on it and a desk. Seats are also placed <lb/>
along each side of the building, and in the centre. <lb/>
Looking from the platform, you have natives of the <lb/>
<pb n="287" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0304"/>
Galla country on the left side of the room, the <reg orig="Wan-|illa">Wanilla</reg>, <lb/>
or people of Rib&eacute;, on the right, while the children of <lb/>
both tribes occupy the centre immediately facing the <lb/>
speakers. There are no windows in the room; but as <lb/>
the lowest part of the roof is considerably above the side <lb/>
walls, abundance of light comes in at this place, as well <lb/>
as by the door.</p>
<p>"As I entered the room, there were seated on the <lb/>
platform Mr. New, Mr. Yates, and my husband, who <lb/>
invited me to come forward and take a seat by his side <lb/>
on that elevated spot. I went forward to him, and <lb/>
dropped down on the first seat I came to, on the left <lb/>
of my clerical brethren. Mr. Wakefield spoke to the <lb/>
people from John iii. 16, in Kinika, and Mr. New <reg orig="fol-|lowed">followed</reg> <lb/>
in Galla, on the same subject. Of course it was <lb/>
all a strange jargon to me from beginning to end; but <lb/>
this will not always be the case.</p>
<p>"After the morning service was over, and we came <lb/>
out of the chapel, my husband desired me to take a seat <lb/>
under the verandah just by our front door, to receive the <lb/>
congratulations of the people as they went away to their <lb/>
homes. I went indoors and fetched Nellie, and then <lb/>
took my seat as requested, having previously committed <lb/>
to memory the native words of salutation. Then all the <lb/>
folks came round and looked at me. Some stroked my <lb/>
dress, and others had a fancy for feeling my curls. But <lb/>
the baby, oh, the baby! I think she was 'number one.' <lb/>
,Dear me, what a pretty little creature!' 'All in white <lb/>
and what a long frock on!' were among the salutations <lb/>
<pb n="288" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0305"/>
she received. And then, when Nellie looked up, and <lb/>
smiled into their black faces, they laughed heartily&hellip; <lb/>
The fame of my arrival quickly spread itself far and <lb/>
near; and many times have I been called out into the <lb/>
verandah to receive the 'salaam' of strangers, some of <lb/>
whom have come many miles to see what sort of beings <lb/>
Nellie and I were; and we have to sit and be looked at. <lb/>
Seldom, however, have any of the visitors left without <lb/>
asking me what I had brought them from England."</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Our</hi> book, devoted to Memorials of Christian <lb/>
Women, would be incomplete indeed did we not <lb/>
include Christine Alsop in our gallery. Although her <lb/>
sphere of action was limited, her influence on those who <lb/>
ever came within her reach was great, and she, though <lb/>
being dead, yet speaketh. Christine Alsop was a revered <lb/>
member of the Community of Friends, and lived and <lb/>
died a shining light amongst them.</p>
<p>Rich in faith and abundant in good works, she <reg orig="ex-|tended">extended</reg> <lb/>
the helping hand to all whom it was within her <lb/>
power to relieve; and she did what she could to extend <lb/>
and exalt the religious life. Wherever she travelled, or <lb/>
into whatever society she entered, she left behind her the <lb/>
sweetest of influences.</p>
<q><lg type="group">
<l rend="indent">"Can that then be dead,</l>
<l>Whose spiritual influence is upon his kind?</l>
<l>He lives in glory; and such speaking dust</l>
<l>Has more of life than half its breathing moulds."</l>
</lg></q>
<p>She had the gift of persuasion, and no one could <lb/>
<pb n="290" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0307"/>
possibly be long in her society but who at once became <lb/>
her devotee, and felt the power that a good woman <lb/>
always possesses over the human heart. As Milton <lb/>
says:&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"Yet hold it more humane, more heavenly first,</l>
<l>By winning words, to conquer willing hearts,</l>
<l>And make persuasion do the work of fear."</l>
</lg></q>
And when persuasion is used in the interests of religion, <lb/>
its sweetness swells to heaven, of which it is a part. <lb/>
There are those to whom a sense of religion has come in <lb/>
storm and tempest; there are those whom it has <reg orig="sum-|moned">summoned</reg> <lb/>
amid scenes of idle vanity; there are those, too, <lb/>
who have heard its "still small voice" amid rural leisure <lb/>
and placid contentment. But, perhaps, the knowledge <lb/>
which causeth not to err is most frequently impressed <lb/>
upon the mind during seasons of affliction; and tears are <lb/>
the softened showers which cause the seed of heaven to <lb/>
spring and take root in the human heart. And this <lb/>
season, where opportunity offered, Christine Alsop always <lb/>
availed herself of; and many a dying pillow and a <lb/>
wretched home has been made to smile by her tender <lb/>
religious offices and her benevolence. She had the <lb/>
strong faith, which sustained her in her missionary work, <lb/>
that no society can be upheld in happiness and honour <lb/>
without the sentiment of religion; and this she upheld in <lb/>
the hovel and the palace. Christine's religion was that <lb/>
set forth by St. James: "Pure religion and undefiled <lb/>
before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless <lb/>
<pb n="291" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0308"/>
and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself <reg orig="un-|spotted">unspotted</reg> <lb/>
from the world." Religion consists not in <reg orig="know-|ledge">knowledge</reg>, <lb/>
but in a holy life. It wipes guilt from the <reg orig="con-|science">conscience</reg>, <lb/>
rolls the world out of the heart and darkness <lb/>
from the mind. It will brighten the most gloomy scene, <lb/>
smooth the most rugged path, and cheer the most <reg orig="de-|spairing">despairing</reg> <lb/>
mind. It robs the grave of its terrors and death <lb/>
of its sting.</p>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"True religion, sprung from God above,</l>
<l>Is, like her fountain, full of charity;</l>
<l>Embracing all things with a tender love,</l>
<l>Full of goodwill and much expectancy;</l>
<l>Full of true justice and sure verity,</l>
<l>In heart and voice; free, large, even infinite,&mdash;</l>
<l>Not wedged in strait particularity,</l>
<l>But grasping all in her vast, active spright;</l>
<l>Bright lamp of God! that men would joy in thy pure light!"</l>
</lg></q>
<p>Humble love, not proud reason, was the essence of <lb/>
Christine Alsop's religious faith; religion was her <lb/>
business, and it was eminently blessed to her. She was a <lb/>
good Friend, and she had a great affection for the people <lb/>
she worshipped with. Her sweet society was everywhere <lb/>
esteemed, always labouring and loving, and her recent <lb/>
death came as a most unexpected shock to very many of <lb/>
her friends and acquaintances. But she was well <reg orig="pre-|pared">prepared</reg> <lb/>
for the great change before the final summons <lb/>
came.</p>
<p>Both Christine and her husband were great favourites <lb/>
with her Majesty and the Royal Family. During a <lb/>
serious attack of influenza and erysipelas, which confined <lb/>
<pb n="292" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0309"/>
her to her bed for several days and to the house for some <lb/>
time afterwards, she wrote to our Princess Royal &lpar;now <lb/>
Crown Princess of Germany&rpar; through a friend that was <lb/>
travelling to Berlin, who personally handed the Princess <lb/>
the letter at her own palace. The Princess was evidently <lb/>
pleased at being so thought of by Mrs. Alsop, of whom <lb/>
she spoke affectionately, and mentioned "la bonne dame" <lb/>
as the name by which her brothers and sisters used to <lb/>
call her on her visits at Buckingham Palace when they <lb/>
were children.</p>
<p>On the death of the little Prince Waldemar of Prussia, <lb/>
which took place within a few hours of her friend's visit, <lb/>
Christine Alsop wrote again to the Crown Princess in <lb/>
sympathy with her in her grief, which note was <lb/>
gratefully acknowledged; and on many occasions, both <lb/>
of joy and sorrow, she had in this way ready access to the <lb/>
Royal Family, to speak of whom, and show their letters <lb/>
to her friends, was a source of peculiar pleasure to <reg orig="her-|self">herself</reg> <lb/>
and of interest to her hearers.</p>
<p>The last of these was an autograph note of the Duke <lb/>
of Connaught, after his marriage with the Princess Louise <lb/>
Marguerite of Prussia, acknowledging a kind note and <lb/>
receipt of a copy of some lines written by Robert Alsop <lb/>
upon the marriage of a cousin, which, the Duke said, he <lb/>
and the Duchess had read with interest and liked very <lb/>
much. For each member of the Royal Family, in turn, <lb/>
Mrs. Alsop had worked and presented her tokens of <lb/>
interest; but in this case, she said, she felt unable <lb/>
to <hi rend="italic">make</hi> anything, and could only send a short note of <lb/>
<pb n="293" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0310"/>
congratulation, with a copy of her husband's verses, which <lb/>
seemed appropriate to the occasion.</p>
<p>The Queen had been pleased at one time to accept a <lb/>
very pretty Afghan blanket for her boudoir-couch; the <lb/>
Prince of Wales something of the same kind for his <lb/>
Princess, whilst the young princess-mothers were all <lb/>
delighted with knitted shoes for their babies, and put in <lb/>
a petition for more after they had used those of dear Mrs. <lb/>
Alsop's beautiful knitting.</p>
<p>The late Princess Alice and Princess Helena showed <lb/>
themselves much attached to Mrs. Alsop; and frequently, <lb/>
when the former was over in England, she would appoint <lb/>
an interview of a quiet and friendly character either at <lb/>
Buckingham Palace or Windsor Castle, according as she <lb/>
was visiting at either place.</p>
<p>Photographs of themselves and children were freely <lb/>
given; and upon Robert Alsop's decease, the Queen <lb/>
sent one of her own likenesses to his widow, after having <lb/>
received those of herself and husband by her Majesty's <lb/>
request, "if she had any to spare." The Queen's <reg orig="amanu-|ensis">amanuensis</reg> <lb/>
writes:&mdash;"Her Majesty very deeply participates in <lb/>
your sorrow, and has charged me to express from herself <lb/>
her true sympathy, and the hope that you will be <reg orig="sus-|tained">sustained</reg> <lb/>
by Him whom you and that good Mr. Alsop <lb/>
have always served with so much zeal."&mdash;&lpar;Balmoral, 14 <lb/>
January, 1876.&rpar;</p>
<p>From the time just preceding and throughout the <lb/>
Yearly Meeting, Mrs. Alsop had been somewhat better in <lb/>
health than common. She attended every sitting of the <lb/>
<pb n="294" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0311"/>
Yearly Meeting and three large public meetings <reg orig="after-|wards">afterwards</reg>, <lb/>
herself remarking this would have been impossible <lb/>
but for the considerate arrangements made for her by the <lb/>
kind personal friends who had heretofore also provided <lb/>
for her comfort at the hotel at Yearly Meeting. It was <lb/>
several times noticed how remarkably bright her <reg orig="com-|munications">communications</reg> <lb/>
were in the various meetings this season.</p>
<p>Her three sisters, Lydie Majolier, Christianna Alsop, <lb/>
and Mary Milner, were all up at the Yearly Meeting; and <lb/>
to be thus all together was a pleasure they had not <reg orig="en-|joyed">enjoyed</reg> <lb/>
since the loss of her dear husband, and her sister <lb/>
Lydie's illness, about two years ago, when poor Christine <lb/>
mourned for her as dead, and could not believe they <lb/>
would ever meet in this life again. In this anticipated <lb/>
sorrow she was overwhelmed with grief, but "the stone <lb/>
was rolled away," and now we may rejoice for her that <lb/>
the days of all her mourning are ended.</p>
<p>After the Yearly Meeting she and her sister projected <lb/>
a few social visits amongst the friends of their earlier <lb/>
years. Amongst others she made a kindly call at the <lb/>
house of an intimate friend at Upper Clapton, on her <lb/>
way to spend a few hours at Knott's Green with Mrs. <lb/>
Gurney Barclay. She was accompanied by her sister <lb/>
Lydie, Anna Vally, and Myra &lpar;C. A.'s own attendant&rpar;; <lb/>
and hopes were mutually expressed that they might meet <lb/>
again shortly. On this occasion allusion was made to <lb/>
the memoir which she had just brought out, relating to <lb/>
her dear husband; and Christine expressed the solace it <lb/>
had been to her in the compilation, living the past over <lb/>
<pb n="295" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0312"/>
again, as it were, and revelling in the pleasure of perusing <lb/>
her beloved one's handwriting, beguiling her into such <lb/>
sweet, fresh, mental association with him. She said <lb/>
there was enough matter amongst the MSS. for another <lb/>
volume, but she did not know whether she should ever <lb/>
accomplish it.</p>
<p>The following week Mrs. Alsop and her party went to <lb/>
Reigate, where they were kindly welcomed by their <lb/>
friend Rebecca Pryor, and a few days were spent very <lb/>
pleasantly under her roof. The weather brightened <lb/>
whilst at Hill Brow, and one warm summer-like day <lb/>
they sat out for a short time very enjoyably in the <lb/>
garden.</p>
<p>The little party left Reigate for Lewes and <reg orig="Welling-|ham">Wellingham</reg>, <lb/>
where they were kindly received by Rachel <reg orig="Rick-|man">Rickman</reg> <lb/>
and her sister; but Mrs. Alsop was a good deal <reg orig="ex-|hausted">exhausted</reg> <lb/>
by the journey.</p>
<p>On Sunday they attended Lewes meeting, and both <lb/>
the sisters were acceptably engaged in ministerial service. <lb/>
They dined at Burwood and Mary Godlee's, where it <lb/>
was remarked how worn dear Mrs. Alsop looked. She <lb/>
acknowledged to being "very tired" and "wanting <lb/>
rest." And now for the first time appeared the real <lb/>
indisposition, which afterwards hourly increased, and <lb/>
from which her strength never rallied.</p>
<p>In course of the afternoon she felt that she had taken <lb/>
a chill, and some threatenings of erysipelas came on, at <lb/>
which she became rather uneasy, but not sufficiently so <lb/>
to deter her sister and Anna Vally from going to the <lb/>
<pb n="296" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0313"/>
evening meeting, the carriage from Wellingham having <lb/>
been ordered to call for them at its close.</p>
<p>Mary B. Godlee kindly stayed with Christine; but as <lb/>
time went on, she became so much more poorly that she <lb/>
was anxious to return to her Wellingham quarters <reg orig="with-|out">without</reg> <lb/>
delay. The carriage was therefore not waited for; a <lb/>
fly was procured, and the invalid well wrapped up, to <lb/>
avoid further chill as much as possible. She had retired <lb/>
to bed when her sister and Anna Vally returned from <lb/>
the meeting.</p>
<p>Three or four days after, it was thought well for a <lb/>
medical man to see her, and the doctor was sent for. <lb/>
He did not at the first interview manifest a very <reg orig="dis-|couraging">discouraging</reg> <lb/>
impression, and the patient herself seemed to <lb/>
feel no alarm.</p>
<p>She was quite peaceful, happy, and satisfied, and <lb/>
seemed to have no wish to be other than where she <lb/>
was&mdash;not even a longing to be at home.</p>
<p>To Myra, after her return from Lewes, she said, "Ah! <lb/>
Myra, I shall some day slip through your fingers before <lb/>
you are aware."</p>
<p>Many times, when in usual health and talking with <lb/>
Myra upon past, present, and future, she would remark, <lb/>
"I should wish to be interred at Stoke Newington;" and <lb/>
she repeated this at Wellingham, but with no especial <lb/>
reference to her then condition.</p>
<p>No anxiety was manifested; in short she seemed to <lb/>
be kept in perfect peace, without anything pressing <lb/>
upon her mind that she wished to have said or done.</p>
<pb n="297" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0314"/>
<p>In her dozing wanderings, these were all on pleasant <lb/>
subjects, and she said many sweet things to her sister.</p>
<p>On one occasion Lydie said to her, "Thou art going <lb/>
to thy beloved," when the reply was, "Yes! Jesus is my <lb/>
Beloved;" and again, "I am my Beloved's, and my <lb/>
Beloved is mine. &hellip; I am going to my Beloved!" <lb/>
After an interval, "I am the Good Shepherd: the <lb/>
Good Shepherd giveth His life for His sheep." &hellip; <lb/>
"I know My sheep, and am known of Mine." &hellip; <lb/>
"I give unto them eternal life." After a pause, she <lb/>
added, "And that life is in His Son." Subsequently, she <lb/>
repeated three times, "I am on the banks of <reg orig="deliver-|ance">deliverance</reg>! <lb/>
How sweet! Happy, happy!"</p>
<p>One evening, poor Myra, who had witnessed her dear <lb/>
master's last hour, became alarmed for her mistress. <lb/>
The breathing was much oppressed, and the restlessness <lb/>
greater; Myra expressed her belief that her mistress was <lb/>
very ill. Lydie would fain have slept in her sister's <lb/>
room that night, but Christine was quite satisfied with <lb/>
her own attendant and wished no change; so the <reg orig="house-|hold">household</reg> <lb/>
retired to rest, Myra keeping anxious watch over <lb/>
the invalid.</p>
<p>About two o'clock in the morning a decided change <lb/>
came on. Alarm was felt, and the doctor urgently sent <lb/>
for; he came without loss of time, and at once <reg orig="pro-|nounced">pronounced</reg> <lb/>
her dying, with but a short time longer to live.</p>
<p>In reply to her sister's inquiry, "Dost thou know <lb/>
me?" dear Christine replied, "Oui,&mdash;Lydie." "Art <lb/>
thou in pain?" The answer, "No."</p>
<pb n="298" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0315"/>
<p>Lydie M. says: "always <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italic">un sourire</hi></foreign> was on her lips <lb/>
when we spoke to her."</p>
<p>Slowly the hours passed on, but no rallying. No <lb/>
uneasiness, or anxiety about <hi rend="italic">anything;</hi> scarcely any <lb/>
pain. Peace within, and sweet peace without.</p>
<p>No undue agitation in the house. The friend under <lb/>
whose roof this solemn season was passing expressed it <lb/>
as "a privilege to have it so," further remarking that <lb/>
"Dear Christine had seemed permitted to come there <lb/>
to show them how a Christian can die."</p>
<p>Poor Myra, "faithful Myra!" has passed a time <lb/>
surely never to be forgotten, for religion has been shown <lb/>
forth to her as a very happy thing for death as well as <lb/>
life. Her mistress had often inferred that her time would <lb/>
be short, and day by day had talked of her husband.</p>
<p>About eight o'clock on 5th-day morning, the 19th, a <lb/>
telegram was sent to her nephew, who hastened from <lb/>
London by the next train, reaching Wellingham before <lb/>
noon; but a swifter Messenger had arrived before him, <lb/>
and the closed shutters announced that all was over ere <lb/>
the door was opened for him.</p>
<p>This godly woman died on the 19th of June, 1879.</p>
<p>Such a gentle dismissal from the shackles of Earth! <lb/>
Such an undoubted assurance of her having entered the <lb/>
Rest prepared for the people of God!</p>
<p>The features in death were calm, as in restful sleep, <lb/>
with a smile upon her lips.</p>
<p>Extract from the note of a dear personal friend, on <lb/>
hearing of dear C. Alsop's decease:&mdash;</p>
<pb n="299" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0316"/>
<p>"In dwelling on the loss of our beloved friend, <lb/>
which is great indeed to the Church, and to the <reg orig="im-|mediate">immediate</reg> <lb/>
circle in which she moved, there is, however, a <lb/>
sense of perfect peace&mdash;a sense that her work on earth <lb/>
was done; an assurance that she had entered into Rest <lb/>
&mdash;the Rest that remaineth to the people of God."</p>
<p>What a bright Christian example has Mrs. Alsop left <lb/>
behind her! Her course and gifts were of no common <lb/>
character or measure.</p>
<p>The verses copied and sent to the Duke of Connaught <lb/>
and his bride, to which we have previously referred, were <lb/>
as under:&mdash; <lb/>

&lsqb;<hi rend="small-caps">one of the pioneers of the central african mission.</hi>&rsqb;</head>
<figure id="f29" rend="block" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0318"/>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">This</hi> famous missionary lady was the eldest sister of <lb/>
Bishop Mackenzie, who shared his sister's labours <lb/>
in Central Africa; indeed, so much were they in <reg orig="asso-|ciation">association</reg>, <lb/>
that it is quite impossible to disconnect them <lb/>
when writing of their missionary efforts. The <reg orig="Macken-|zies">Mackenzies</reg> <lb/>
were a large family. Their father was an eminent <lb/>
Scotch lawyer, pursuing the duties of his profession at <lb/>
Edinburgh, and living also at a country house in <reg orig="Peebles-|shire">Peeblesshire</reg>. <lb/>
The bishop and his sister were most carefully <lb/>
brought up, and were early cultivated to the habits which <lb/>
thriftiness usually induces. Their father and mother <lb/>
were decided Episcopalians, and took an active part in <lb/>
the building of a small church near their own home, <lb/>
which was opened in the summer of 1830. Mrs. <reg orig="Mac-|kenzie">Mackenzie</reg> <lb/>
had been heard to say that she doubted whether <lb/>
there was much real religion amongst her children. Her <lb/>
words were, "I believe it consisted in our thinking <reg orig="our-|selves">ourselves</reg> <lb/>
superior to our Presbyterian neighbours."</p>
<p>The day of the opening of the church referred to was <lb/>
the first occasion when Charlie &lpar;afterwards the bishop&rpar; <lb/>
<pb n="302" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0319"/>
went to service. He was then a small delicate child of <lb/>
five years old, the youngest in the family. Anne <reg orig="Mac-|kenzie">Mackenzie</reg> <lb/>
&lpar;the subject of our memoir&rpar; was then seventeen <lb/>
years of age. Her father died a few months later, and <lb/>
great care was now needed for the bringing up of this <lb/>
large family. They removed to Edinburgh. There was <lb/>
evidently much life in the home, a considerable amount of <lb/>
intelligence and spirit, and not a little interest in public <lb/>
men and public questions. Charlie Mackenzie was not <lb/>
supposed by outsiders to be particularly gifted. They <lb/>
said, "He will never set the Thames on fire." He gave <lb/>
signs, however, in very early days, of possessing <reg orig="mathe-|matical">mathematical</reg> <lb/>
genius. He became a student at Cambridge, <lb/>
and came out second wrangler in 1841, when twenty-three <lb/>
years old. The influence of his elder sister, Anne, upon <lb/>
him was of a kind which can never fail to prove <reg orig="bene-|ficial">beneficial</reg> <lb/>
to a man of the Mackenzie type of character. He <lb/>
was evidently designed for labours somewhat different <lb/>
from those which are required in an ordinary pastoral <lb/>
sphere, and it was not wonderful that in 1853 he should <lb/>
have had serious thoughts of leaving home for India, <lb/>
where a young friend had gone to take the headship of <lb/>
a new mission at Delhi; but in the autumn of 1854, a <lb/>
year and a half after, he had decided to abandon this <lb/>
idea. Dr. Colenso, the newly appointed bishop of Natal, <lb/>
had returned to England,&mdash;after having been in the <lb/>
colony for ten weeks,&mdash;for the purpose of securing <reg orig="co-|adjutors">coadjutors</reg> <lb/>
in his newly accepted labours. He asked young <lb/>
Mackenzie to go out with him as his archdeacon; and <lb/>
<pb n="303" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0320"/>
thither in the following spring he went, accompanied by <lb/>
his sister Anne.</p>
<p>Her medical adviser had long ago told her that she <lb/>
was born to be a perpetual care to her mother. As long <lb/>
as that mother remained to care for her it was well; but <lb/>
when death broke the bond which bound the mother to <lb/>
earth, a new and somewhat weary time commenced for <lb/>
Anne Mackenzie. A milder climate would evidently be <lb/>
of service to her health, and her brother gave her a warm <lb/>
invitation to go to Africa with him.</p>
<p>He said, "Natal has a beautiful climate, and I fancy <lb/>
you would not wish for a better escort than mine."</p>
<p>Perhaps as one looks back upon the circumstances, it <lb/>
is fair to say that Anne can hardly ever have had health <lb/>
and strength enough to battle with the difficulties of such <lb/>
a life. But she seems gradually to have accommodated <lb/>
herself to its requirements, and to have become better <lb/>
and nobler by reason of the obligations which they <lb/>
imposed upon her.</p>
<p>Miss Mackenzie had a great repugnance to Kaffir <lb/>
society. She bore rather sadly at first the deprivation of <lb/>
home comforts and tastes. As time went on, however, <lb/>
she fitted in more easily to the necessities of her position, <lb/>
and at all times received abundant kindness from her <lb/>
brother, whom she never failed to reward with her <reg orig="un-|bounded">unbounded</reg> <lb/>
gratitude.</p>
<p>From a sketch of herself and her brother, by Frances <lb/>
Awdry, it is interesting to come across the incidents <lb/>
which occasioned so much discomfort to the new <lb/>
<pb n="304" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0321"/>
colonists, as, for instance, the following unpleasant <lb/>
circumstance which attended their occupation of a <lb/>
baker's shop which Mr. Mackenzie secured for a <reg orig="resi-|dence">residence</reg> <lb/>
while he fulfilled the duties of a clergyman at <lb/>
Durban.</p>
<p>"When the archdeacon in house-hunting came to the <lb/>
baker's store, he thought the workmen had left a <reg orig="barrow-|ful">barrowful</reg> <lb/>
of earth on the floor of one of the rooms, but the <lb/>
landlord shook his head, and said 'the mound was the <lb/>
work of the white ants, which he had dislodged from the <lb/>
house twice before. This had to be done again by <reg orig="dig-|ging">digging</reg> <lb/>
down more than two feet, till they found the <reg orig="ant-|queen">ant-queen</reg>, <lb/>
a most disgusting-looking creature, like a <reg orig="mon-|strous">monstrous</reg> <lb/>
white slug, a fat, transparent grub, with a small <lb/>
head and black waist, very unlike her subjects, who are <lb/>
not larger than small English ants. The queen killed, <lb/>
and the hole smeared with tar, they hoped they had got <lb/>
rid of the enemy; but the next day, to their <reg orig="disappoint-|ment">disappointment</reg>, <lb/>
molehills appeared in various places about the <lb/>
house, and things looked as bad as ever. Boiling water <lb/>
had to be poured on many times, but experienced <lb/>
colonists comforted the Mackenzies by saying this would <lb/>
not last long; probably the mounds were made by ants <lb/>
who had not yet found out that their queen was dead; <lb/>
and so it turned out, for they soon disappeared. This <lb/>
was far from being the last trouble they had with ants, <lb/>
which were one of the great discomforts of the colony. <lb/>
There are many kinds of them, and they will eat clothes, <lb/>
books, paper, anything, in fact, that it is desirable they <lb/>
<pb n="305" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0322"/>
should not eat. This did not affect the archdeacon and <lb/>
his sister."</p>
<p>After this time they went into the interior and <reg orig="com-|menced">commenced</reg> <lb/>
a mission station; but they previously became <lb/>
familiar with the kind of work which was called for by <lb/>
visiting a station which had already been begun by the <lb/>
Rev. Mr. Robertson, on the Umlazi river. The <reg orig="follow-|ing">following</reg> <lb/>
description of this place is given in the interesting <lb/>
volume already referred to:&mdash;</p>
<p>"It was a lovely place, the soil was very fertile, and <lb/>
the situation was well chosen for the work, as there were <lb/>
many Kaffir kraals within riding distance of it. 'I long <lb/>
for you to see it,' Mrs. Robertson wrote to Miss <reg orig="Mac-|kenzie">Mackenzie</reg>, <lb/>
soon after they had moved there. 'It is such <lb/>
a pure air and fine country; everything is so beautiful, <lb/>
and our house is quite bearable&mdash;much better than I <lb/>
expected. The floor of our house is so springy that we <lb/>
make the furniture spring as we walk. We have frogs, <lb/>
and ants, and spiders, and mice, but we are daily finding <lb/>
out new ways <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to have them. We have coffee-coloured <lb/>
walls, and a brown roof; it is a very brown-looking <lb/>
house!'</p>
<p>"This was the dwelling house, which was thirty feet <lb/>
long by fourteen wide, and was divided by screens <lb/>
into drawing-room, dining-room, and bedroom. A guest <lb/>
had her own hut to sleep in. When Mrs. Robertson <lb/>
saw Miss Mackenzie crossing the river on the way to <lb/>
pay her first visit there, she put the last touch to her <lb/>
preparations by calling for a rake, and seeing that the <lb/>
<pb n="306" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0323"/>
earthen floor was raked smooth before the mats with <lb/>
which it was carpeted were laid down. In course of <lb/>
time a hut was built for the archdeacon&mdash;a common <lb/>
Kaffir hut, only with a high door through which you <lb/>
could walk, instead of crawling. A day had been fixed <lb/>
for him to come and take possession of it; and he did <lb/>
come, though it was raining so much that his friends had <lb/>
ceased to expect him. Of course he was warmly <reg orig="wel-|comed">welcomed</reg>, <lb/>
and Mrs. Robertson showed him to his new <lb/>
house; but to her horror it was not empty&mdash;a dead cow <lb/>
was hanging up in it.</p>
<p>"The Christian Kaffirs, of whom there were a few at <lb/>
the station, had wished to kill a cow, salt it, and make it <lb/>
into sausages, and this plan pleased their teachers, who <lb/>
thought it an improvement of the greedy Kaffir fashion <lb/>
of sitting down to a cow, and eating it all at one meal. <lb/>
Mrs. Robertson had not intended, however, that it <lb/>
should be kept in the archdeacon's bedroom, and had <lb/>
it removed, but next morning it was found in the bath, <lb/>
which the Kaffirs declared was the only place there was <lb/>
for it, since it was not to be eaten immediately."</p>
<p>Some time afterwards, at the end of 1859, Anne <reg orig="Mac-|kenzie">Mackenzie</reg> <lb/>
and her brother returned to England. It was <lb/>
not quite clear what Archdeacon Mackenzie would do. <lb/>
It had been thought well to send a missionary bishop <lb/>
into Zululand, and Bishop Colenso had some idea of <lb/>
undertaking the duty himself. It however appeared <lb/>
probable at one time that it would be accepted by <reg orig="Mac-|kenzie">Mackenzie</reg>. <lb/>
When he was at home the country was gaining <lb/>
<pb n="307" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0324"/>
an interest in a mission to Central Africa, Dr. <reg orig="Living-|stone">Livingstone</reg> <lb/>
having stirred the hearts of the English <reg orig="Univer-|sities">Universities</reg> <lb/>
upon the subject some years before. On the 1st <lb/>
of November, 1859, a monster missionary meeting was <lb/>
held at the Senate House at Cambridge. It had already <lb/>
been suggested that Archdeacon Mackenzie would be <lb/>
the best possible head of the new enterprise. In the <lb/>
October following, after many months of labour on behalf <lb/>
of the cause of Central African Missions, the archdeacon <lb/>
went forth again to that land; the plan decided upon <lb/>
being, that he should be consecrated at Cape Town as <lb/>
bishop; his sister Anne waiting meanwhile at the Cape <lb/>
during his own inspection of the country, and also to <lb/>
allow time for making such arrangements as would <lb/>
certainly be necessary.</p>
<p>The brother and the sister parted at the Cape. They <lb/>
never met again. In January, 1862, Mackenzie came <lb/>
down from his station in the interior to the river <reg orig="Zam-|besi">Zambesi</reg>, <lb/>
accompanied by a missionary brother, for the <reg orig="pur-|pose">purpose</reg> <lb/>
of meeting the latter's wife and his own sister, who <lb/>
were to be brought up on board the <hi rend="italic">Pioneer</hi> by Dr. <lb/>
Livingstone to a certain point previously settled upon. <lb/>
The journey and the voyage had proved too much for <lb/>
both these men, and an upset of their boat had spoiled <lb/>
their stores. A medicine chest was lost containing the <lb/>
quinine, which was their most powerful ally in repelling <lb/>
the feverish attacks which are so dreadful in those <lb/>
terrible regions.</p>
<p>When some weeks afterwards Mrs. Burrup and Miss <lb/>
<pb n="308" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0325"/>
Mackenzie reached the spot, it was soon to learn that <lb/>
her brother had left a world of toil and suffering for his <lb/>
Master's presence. Mrs. Burrup received also the sad <lb/>
tidings of her husband's death at the station to which <lb/>
he had but returned to die.</p>
<p>Africa became henceforth, for the remaining fifteen <lb/>
years of Anne Mackenzie's life, the cherished place of <lb/>
her heart's true interest. She did all she could for a <lb/>
people who had been cared for so nobly by her brother; <lb/>
and to her life's latest hour bore them upon her heart.</p>
<p>She succeeded in obtaining large sums of money for <lb/>
the carrying out of missionary enterprise, and became a <lb/>
centre of influence and attraction for all who had any <lb/>
interest in that distant land. She was a welcome friend <lb/>
at Hursley Vicarage, during the life of Mr. and Mrs. <lb/>
Keble, and evidently shared her brother's deep reverence <lb/>
for the modern Herbert, and his full appreciation of the <lb/>
"Christian Year."</p>
<p>Nobly, yet quietly, she continued to bear her great <lb/>
sorrows; and ever the more earnestly to cling to those <lb/>
precious hopes which may always be found growing upon <lb/>
the verge of life's heaviest griefs, when the heart clings <lb/>
to Him who is the one great Source of consolation and <lb/>
of peace. After her great and successful work in <reg orig="spread-|ing">spreading</reg> <lb/>
Christianity in a heathen and a distant land, she died <lb/>
at Havant, on February 11th, 1877.</p>

longer much known. But her character has in it so <lb/>
much to admire, in her straightforward carrying out of <lb/>
anything she believed to be true and right, that, in spite <lb/>
of her strong idiosyncrasies, her history may well be <reg orig="in-|vigorating">invigorating</reg> <lb/>
to other minds.</p>
<p>Charlotte Elizabeth Browne was born at Norwich on <lb/>
the 1st of October, 1790, and during her earliest years <lb/>
her home was under the shadow of the cathedral. The <lb/>
little girl had a most lively imagination, and she loved <lb/>
nothing better than to play alone in the bishop's garden, <lb/>
enjoying her own thoughts. This garden, to which she <lb/>
had full access, was bounded on one side by the cathedral; <lb/>
<pb n="310" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0327"/>
and as she sat on the grass weaving daisy chains, little <lb/>
Charlotte's eyes would wander, now over the noble pile <lb/>
of stone far above her head, and then to the bright array <lb/>
of flowers at her feet, while all the time her fancy was <lb/>
weaving webs of many colours and of varied textures. <lb/>
The nursery tales of those days were full of fairies and <lb/>
goblins which in her mind grew into "hosts of <reg orig="marvel-|lous">marvellous</reg> <lb/>
creatures decked out in colours of her own <reg orig="supply-|ing">supplying</reg>, <lb/>
gorgeous or terrible, beyond the conception of her <lb/>
classic authorities." Before she was four, Charlotte's home <lb/>
was transferred to another part of the city, near to the <lb/>
church of St. Giles', of which her father was rector. Here <lb/>
she enjoyed roving in the large shrubbery and flower <lb/>
garden attached to the ancient vine-covered house. Of <lb/>
an evening she used to linger under a gigantic mulberry <lb/>
tree, and there wait till the great night owl should <reg orig="ap-|pear">appear</reg>. <lb/>
To watch him wheel round the tree, and to listen <lb/>
to his melancholy hoot as he called his companions, <lb/>
while the bat brushed past her in the twilight, was a weird <lb/>
pleasure to the romantic little child.</p>
<p>The love of music was early developed in her. Her <lb/>
father had an unusually fine voice and a very high degree <lb/>
of "scientific knowledge and taste in the management of <lb/>
it." It was his great pleasure to provide enjoyment for <lb/>
his little daughter through this his favourite pursuit. A <lb/>
fellow clergyman, skilled in instrumental music, was often <lb/>
an inmate of the house, and in after years Charlotte <reg orig="Eliza-|beth">Elizabeth</reg> <lb/>
recalls the feelings of her childhood while listening <lb/>
to his performances. "The rich tones of his old <reg orig="harpsi-|chord">harpsichord</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="311" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0328"/>
seem still to fill my ear and swell my heart; while <lb/>
my father's deep, clear, mellow voice breaks in with some <lb/>
noble recitation or elaborate air of Handel, etc. Or the <lb/>
harpsichord was relinquished to another hand, and the <lb/>
breath of our friend came forth through the reed of his <lb/>
hautboy in strains of such overpowering melody that I <lb/>
have hid my face in my mother's lap to weep the feelings <lb/>
that absolutely wrung my little heart with excess of <reg orig="en-|joyment">enjoyment</reg>.</p>
<p>Before she was six years old, Charlotte, already <reg orig="exceed-|ingly">exceedingly</reg> <lb/>
fond of reading, accepted the offer of an uncle, a <lb/>
physician, to teach her French. The French lesson was <lb/>
taken, seated on her young uncle's knee in the hall of <lb/>
his residence, and the reward for diligence was "some <lb/>
sublime strain from the deep-toned organ" which stood <lb/>
there. Both lesson and reward were so fascinating that <lb/>
every power was strained to make rapid progress. At <lb/>
night the French book was placed under the pillow, and <lb/>
at earliest break of day the sleepy eyes were strained over <lb/>
the page until she became quite blind. During the time <lb/>
that the blindness lasted she had the entertainment of <lb/>
listening to the stirring conversations and discussions, <lb/>
literary and political, which went on among the friends <lb/>
who frequented the rectory. With nothing to distract her <lb/>
attention, the little girl turned her face from one to <reg orig="an-|other">another</reg> <lb/>
of the unseen speakers, her mind opening to take <lb/>
in many things that she heard, with an appreciation far <lb/>
beyond her years. Her father's interest in the great <reg orig="ques-|tions">questions</reg> <lb/>
of the day, and his powers of conversation and of <lb/>
<pb n="312" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0329"/>
argument, made him very attractive to a large circle, and <lb/>
he was "so devotedly, so proudly, the Englishman," <lb/>
that his child could hardly fail, she tells us, to become <lb/>
"a thinker, a reasoner, a tory, and a patriot." But the <lb/>
crowning pleasure of those months of blindness was the <lb/>
music. Her father was a minor canon, and every <reg orig="after-|noon">afternoon</reg> <lb/>
after the cathedral service he would bring the <reg orig="chor-|isters">choristers</reg> <lb/>
home with him to sing to his little girl. They were <lb/>
accompanied by her godfather on the harpsichord, and <lb/>
so delicious to her ears were the "feasts of sacred music <lb/>
served up to her" that she confessed to her brother that <lb/>
"music was better than seeing."</p>
<p>This only brother was a light-hearted, beautiful boy, <lb/>
not fond of learning, but devoted to his sister; the two <lb/>
were always together. When she was about seven years <lb/>
old, Charlotte was the means of saving his life. The <lb/>
parents had gone with a friend into the country for a <lb/>
day's excursion, taking the children with them. It was <lb/>
a place celebrated for fishing, and after a long morning <lb/>
spent in this sport the gentlemen had remained indoors <lb/>
with Mrs. Browne. The children were, meanwhile, sent <lb/>
out to play, charged not to go too near the water nor to <lb/>
get into a boat. They strolled about, and at last, <reg orig="with-|out">without</reg> <lb/>
intending it, found themselves by the river. A small <lb/>
boat was close by, and the boy wanted to get into it. <lb/>
His sister reminded him that this was forbidden; when <lb/>
he said, "I won't get in, Cha, but I will sit down here <lb/>
and put my two feet into the little boat." No sooner <lb/>
had he done this than the boat moved and he was drawn <lb/>
<pb n="313" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0330"/>
into the water. He sank, and, reappearing, his sister <lb/>
seized hold of him. How she managed to keep him up <lb/>
without herself being dragged into the water she never <lb/>
knew. She distinctly remembered deciding to hold on <lb/>
to him so firmly that if he sank again she should sink <lb/>
and die with him. The little boy did not struggle, but <lb/>
looked up into his sister's face, she gazing down intently <lb/>
into his. Providentially some labourers, returning from <lb/>
their work, saw the little girl leaning over the bank, <lb/>
and ran to see what she was doing in such a perilous <lb/>
position. One man took hold of her, while the other <lb/>
rescued her brother. Her grasp was not loosened till <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">he</hi> was lifted upon shore. She then became insensible <lb/>
and did not recover consciousness till she found herself <lb/>
in the house, still in the arms of the man who had <lb/>
carried her in, while her mother and the others were <lb/>
restoring the little boy by the fire. Charlotte was much <lb/>
caressed and commended for her heroism. To her it <lb/>
seemed only the natural outcome of her love for her <lb/>
brother, and to her narrative of the occurrence she adds <lb/>
the comment: "Many waters cannot quench love, neither <lb/>
can the floods drown it; if a man would give all the <lb/>
substance of his house for love, it would utterly be <lb/>
contemned."</p>
<p>Whilst still very young, Charlotte received her first <lb/>
lessons in Protestantism. Their father was accustomed to <lb/>
take his two children to a place called the Lollards' Pit, <lb/>
which is just outside the city. One day he pointed to <lb/>
the pit, and told them of the good people burnt there <lb/>
<pb n="314" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0331"/>
by Queen Mary "for refusing to worship wooden <reg orig="im-|ages">images</reg>." <lb/>
Charlotte was horror-stricken, and often recurred <lb/>
to the subject, asking innumerable questions. One day <lb/>
her father, having to go out while the questioner was still <lb/>
unsatisfied, gave her Foxe's "Book of Martyrs," that she <lb/>
might amuse herself with the plates. For hours she <lb/>
pored over the exciting pictures, not deterred by her <lb/>
aching eyes which were still weak. She could not make <lb/>
out the black type, but every word in Roman type she <lb/>
eagerly devoured. Next time her father found her at <lb/>
this employment she looked up at him with flushed <lb/>
cheeks and asked, "Papa, may I be a martyr?" "What <lb/>
do you mean, child?" "I mean, papa, may I be <lb/>
burned to death for my religion as they were? I want <lb/>
to be a martyr." The answer she never forgot, nor the <lb/>
stern pleasure it gave her. "Why, Charlotte, if the <lb/>
Government ever gives power to the papists, as they <lb/>
talk of doing, you may probably live to be a martyr." <lb/>
The seed sown then took root in a most fertile soil, <lb/>
and in Charlotte Elizabeth Protestantism eventually found <lb/>
an uncompromising champion.</p>
<p>She writes that as yet "no glimmer of spiritual <reg orig="knowl-|edge">knowledge</reg> <lb/>
had reached her heart," though she knew the Bible <lb/>
intimately and the sublimer portions from the prophets <lb/>
used to thrill her as she heard her father's voice <reg orig="pro-|nounce">pronounce</reg> <lb/>
them from his stall in the cathedral.</p>
<p>Although the idea of God's love seems not to have <lb/>
penetrated their young hearts, both Charlotte and her <lb/>
brother realized, with awe, His omniscience. When <lb/>
<pb n="315" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0332"/>
either had committed a fault they went hand in hand <lb/>
to tell their mother of it, fearing to add deception to <lb/>
the other sin if they concealed it. The children were <lb/>
generally entirely truthful, but on one occasion <reg orig="Char-|lotte">Charlotte</reg> <lb/>
was led to tell a lie for the benefit of a servant <lb/>
and at her instigation. When suspicion fell upon her, <lb/>
Charlotte at once confessed her sin. Her father sent to <lb/>
a neighbour's to borrow a rod. He then took her apart <lb/>
into another room and said: "Child, it will pain me more <lb/>
to punish you thus than any blows I can inflict will pain <lb/>
you: but I must do it; you have told a lie: it is a <reg orig="dread-|ful">dreadful</reg> <lb/>
sin, and a base, mean, cowardly action. If I let you <lb/>
grow up a liar you will reproach me for it one day; if I <lb/>
now spared the rod I should hate the child." Charlotte <lb/>
received the punishment in the spirit in which it was <lb/>
extended, indeed she seems to have accepted it as a <lb/>
personal favour and "wished every stroke had been a <lb/>
stab." She thanked her father for his kindness. But <lb/>
she was deeply touched by the sobs and entreaties of <lb/>
her little brother who, through the closed door pleaded <lb/>
in his soft voice, "O papa, don't whip Charlotte. Oh, <lb/>
forgive poor Charlotte!"</p>
<p>When her sight had sufficiently recovered the children <lb/>
were taught together by masters. But previously to this, <lb/>
and before it was thought safe for her to use her eyes <lb/>
in learning to write, Charlotte had obtained a patent <lb/>
copybook and had used it so well that her father one <lb/>
day discovered, to his annoyance and amusement, a <reg orig="let-|ter">letter</reg> <lb/>
neatly written by her to a distant relation. It <reg orig="con-|tained">contained</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="316" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0333"/>
a detailed account of a domestic calamity, the <lb/>
creation of her own brain; and so touching was the <lb/>
narration that the tears of the writer had fallen upon <lb/>
the slate on which the letter was written.</p>
<p>When she was ten year old a heavy blow fell upon <lb/>
Charlotte; she lost her hearing, which she never regained. <lb/>
The deafness was complete; and from this cause she <reg orig="re-|tired">retired</reg> <lb/>
still more into the regions of imagination through <lb/>
the medium of books and of her own wild fancy. She <lb/>
always attributed the deafness to the effects of mercury, <lb/>
with which she was unmercifully dosed. From this time <lb/>
music was banished from the house. It no longer afforded <lb/>
pleasure to her father, now that she could not share it with <lb/>
him. Charlotte had always been passionately fond of him <lb/>
and this delicate sympathy for her deprivation deepened <lb/>
her devotion to him. Her health became more and more <lb/>
delicate, so that Mr. Browne decided upon trying a <reg orig="coun-|try">country</reg> <lb/>
life, and for this purpose he exchanged parochial duties <lb/>
with a friend in the country. There his daughter followed <lb/>
as much as possible the prescription of the physician, "to <lb/>
live in the open air and to enjoy unbounded liberty." The <lb/>
results were much destruction of frocks, and the <reg orig="transfor-|mation">transformation</reg> <lb/>
of the sickly, overstrained, city child into a <reg orig="vigor-|ous">vigorous</reg> <lb/>
and blooming country maiden, fond of gardening and <lb/>
rural occupations. Poor Mrs. Browne found the carrying <lb/>
out of the prescription rather trying to her patience and <lb/>
very expensive.</p>
<p>One day her little brother repeated to Charlotte a <reg orig="con-|versation">conversation</reg> <lb/>
he had overheard between their parents. The <lb/>
<pb n="317" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0334"/>
mother began: "Mr. B., this will never do, that girl <reg orig="can-|not">cannot</reg> <lb/>
wear a frock twice without spoiling it. The expense <lb/>
will ruin us." Her husband replied: "Well, my dear, if <lb/>
I am to be ruined by expense let it come in the shape of <lb/>
washerwoman's bills, not in those of the apothecary and <lb/>
undertaker."</p>
<p>Against this and kindred decisions there was no appeal. <lb/>
Mr. Browne combated all efforts on the part of female <lb/>
friends to compress the poor child into "whalebone and <lb/>
buckram"; and when assured by one lady that he could <lb/>
only expect as a consequence that his daughter should <lb/>
become a cripple, he replied: "My child may be a cripple, <lb/>
ma'am, if such is God's will; but she shall be one of His <lb/>
making, not ours."</p>
<p>Once and once only did Charlotte try the experiment of <lb/>
going counter to his wishes in this thing. It was on the <lb/>
occasion of her first ball that she underwent the tight lacing <lb/>
then fashionable. She was heartily disgusted, however, <lb/>
with the suffering entailed on head and chest, and when <lb/>
the evening was over she relates that she flew to her <reg orig="cham-|ber">chamber</reg> <lb/>
and "cut the goodly fabric to pieces."</p>
<p>Charlotte Elizabeth describes the religion she had at this <lb/>
time as being a sort of deism. Morning and evening <lb/>
prayer was never omitted, and a "word uttered against <lb/>
the Bible would kindle her into glowing resentment." <lb/>
After spending the six working days of the week in the <lb/>
regions of imagination and in the manual labour of <reg orig="gar-|dening">gardening</reg>, <lb/>
she rigidly put aside her favourite books on the <lb/>
Sabbath and betook herself to her Bible and a sermon of <lb/>
<pb n="318" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0335"/>
Blair or some kindred writer, returning to her light <reg orig="read-|ing">reading</reg> <lb/>
with renewed zest on the Monday morning. Time <lb/>
fails us to enter into the stirring political and religious <lb/>
questions of that day. Charlotte, deaf as she was, threw <lb/>
herself into the discussion of them with intense ardour. <lb/>
In early as in later life friendly fingers must have been <lb/>
quick to repeat interesting information for her eager eyes, <lb/>
which took in everything with the greatest rapidity.</p>
<p>The time had now come when the cherished son and <lb/>
brother was to go forth into the world. His sister <reg orig="de-|scribes">describes</reg> <lb/>
him as "manly, hardy, and intrepid in character, <lb/>
but in manners sweet, gentle and courteous." He was <lb/>
her admiration and joy, and the two were still constant <lb/>
companions. From early childhood John had shown a <lb/>
taste for a military life, and as he grew older the desire <lb/>
to be a soldier strengthened. The threatened invasion of <lb/>
Buonaparte was the bugbear of children at the beginning <lb/>
of the century, and the volunteer movement had inflamed <lb/>
the martial spirit. Mr. and Mrs. Browne were anxious <lb/>
for their son to settle near them, and, with his natural <lb/>
sweetness of disposition, it is probable he would have <lb/>
given up his idea of becoming a soldier, had not his <reg orig="sis-|ter">sister</reg> <lb/>
encouraged his wish with all the ardour of her nature. <lb/>
She says she saw, "through the lying medium of <reg orig="ro-|mance">romance</reg>, <lb/>
the glory and the fame of a conqueror's wreath <lb/>
and a hero's grave, with all the vain merit of her own <lb/>
sacrifice" in sending away one so beloved.</p>
<p>Her father gave a reluctant consent to the departure <lb/>
of his only son; and through the interest of the bishop, <lb/>
<pb n="319" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0336"/>
who went to London for the purpose, a commission was <lb/>
procured at once, and John Browne started for Portugal <lb/>
to join his regiment, then "hotly engaged in the <reg orig="Penin-|sula">Peninsula</reg>." <lb/>
The suddenness of his departure was almost <reg orig="stun-|ning">stunning</reg>, <lb/>
as his family had fondly hoped for a delay in <reg orig="pro-|curing">procuring</reg> <lb/>
his commission. From this time Charlotte sought <lb/>
to fill the place of both daughter and son to her father, <lb/>
and seldom cared to be absent from him even for an <lb/>
hour.</p>
<p>One friend of her childhood must be mentioned. <reg orig="Al-|though">Although</reg> <lb/>
she had no direct religious teaching from her, she <lb/>
had the feeling that she owed something in after years to <lb/>
the prayers of her paternal grandmother. Probably she <lb/>
had as much force of character as her granddaughter, who <lb/>
sympathized with her independent rejection of anything <lb/>
in dress or manners which did not comport with her own <lb/>
taste or ideas of fitness and propriety; especially did she <lb/>
combat French fashions and modes of thought. <reg orig="Char-|lotte">Charlotte</reg> <lb/>
was proud of the sprightly old lady, "who <hi rend="italic">would</hi> <lb/>
wear her own clean locks, half brown, half grey, combed <lb/>
down under her cap of homely make," resisting the <reg orig="en-|treaties">entreaties</reg> <lb/>
of other dames who submitted to be frizzed, and <lb/>
curled, and powdered before going out to an evening <lb/>
party. And she never forgot her grandmother's lecture <lb/>
upon something new in the cut of a sleeve, ending with <lb/>
the words: "I never wore a gown but of one shape; and <lb/>
because I don't follow the fashion the fashion is forced <lb/>
to come to me sometimes, by way of a change. I can't <lb/>
help that you know, my dear; but I never was <reg orig="fashion-|able">fashionable</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="320" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0337"/>
on purpose." She added something about "vanity <lb/>
and folly," which latter remark made but little impression.</p>
<p>Two years after her brother's departure Charlotte passed <lb/>
through a severe trial. There had been slight indications <lb/>
of failure in her father's health, but he seemed so bright <lb/>
and vigorous in mind that these warnings were <reg orig="disre-|garded">disregarded</reg>; <lb/>
and when his daughter was sent for at midnight <lb/>
to find him dying of apoplexy, the shock was terrible. <lb/>
As we have said before, Charlotte was his devoted <reg orig="com-|panion">companion</reg>. <lb/>
Her mother was absorbed in household matters, <lb/>
in which she took no interest; so that the father and <lb/>
daughter, whose literary and political interests were one, <lb/>
had become almost inseparable.</p>
<p>Having no religious comfort to fall back upon, <reg orig="Char-|lotte">Charlotte</reg> <lb/>
Elizabeth just gave herself up to the "luxury of <lb/>
grieving alone, brooding over the past, and painting the <lb/>
future in any colours but those of reality."</p>
<p>Mr. Brown's income had been small, and he had not <lb/>
made much provision for his family. His widow had a <lb/>
small annuity, and Charlotte Elizabeth proposed to <reg orig="be-|come">become</reg> <lb/>
a novel writer.</p>
<p>For some time she and her mother paid visits among <lb/>
their friends, and finally went to London to make a long <lb/>
stay with some relatives. There Charlotte Elizabeth met <lb/>
with Captain Phelan, a friend of her brother's, and one <lb/>
of his fellow officers in the Peninsula. Captain Browne <lb/>
had been accustomed to show him his sister's letters, and <lb/>
Captain Phelan fell in love with the writer before he had <lb/>
seen her. They became engaged shortly after meeting <lb/>
<pb n="321" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0338"/>
in London. Some of her friends strongly opposed the <lb/>
marriage, probably judging that a young woman of her <lb/>
headstrong will was hardly a suitable companion for one <lb/>
of Captain Phelan's excitable temperament. But she was <lb/>
resolved to take her own way, and they were married. <lb/>
We may not dwell upon the bitter sorrows which were <lb/>
the result of this step. In after years Charlotte Elizabeth <lb/>
wrote the history of her own life, in order that no prurient <lb/>
curiosity might pry into details of these sufferings.</p>
<p>Captain Phelan preceded his wife to Halifax, Nova <lb/>
Scotia, whither his regiment &lpar;the 60th Rifles&rpar; had been <lb/>
ordered; and he sent for her to follow him. Her <reg orig="pas-|sage">passage</reg> <lb/>
was taken in a splendid West Indiaman, which <lb/>
transported a large body of troops. In the little circle <lb/>
of cabin passengers, consisting of seventeen gentlemen <lb/>
and two ladies, she found kind and courteous friends, <lb/>
who vied with each other in caring for the high-spirited <lb/>
and talented young wife. Her lonely position and her <lb/>
privation seemed to give her a claim on the special <reg orig="at-|tentions">attentions</reg> <lb/>
of those around. It was not very easy to take <lb/>
care of her, however. One day when the sea was <reg orig="run-|ning">running</reg> <lb/>
mountains high she was wrapped in a military cloak <lb/>
and conducted on deck just to have a glance at the fine <lb/>
sea. But one glance did not satisfy her, and nothing <lb/>
would induce her to retire; and as her conductor had <lb/>
not nerve enough to remain, she was lashed to the <lb/>
mizzen mast, and from that standpoint revelled in the <lb/>
grand and wonderful turmoil around her. On another <lb/>
occasion, in a fearful storm, when the captain had almost <lb/>
<pb n="322" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0339"/>
given up hope of saving the vessel and there was great <lb/>
alarm among the passengers, Mrs. Phelan was reported <lb/>
to be missing. She was at last found, by a young officer, <lb/>
at one of the stern windows in the state cabin. She had <lb/>
climbed three tiers of lockers to obtain this position, <lb/>
and was "leaning out as far as she could reach, <reg orig="en-|raptured">enraptured</reg> <lb/>
beyond expression with the terrific grandeur of <lb/>
the scene." The officer reported her to the captain; and <lb/>
as she refused to leave the window, he sent the mate to <lb/>
put up the dead lights, to her profound chagrin. She <lb/>
was at this time perfectly without fear of death, even to <lb/>
recklessness. At Halifax she rode a mare of Arab <reg orig="de-|scent">descent</reg>, <lb/>
which no one else could tame. Seated on an <lb/>
awkward country saddle, she had mad enjoyment in <lb/>
exploring the country. Throwing herself entirely upon <lb/>
the fond attachment of the beautiful creature, her life <lb/>
seems not to have been endangered, for the least <reg orig="whis-|per">whisper</reg>, <lb/>
or gentle touch of the hand, of her mistress, would <lb/>
restrain her; and for her sake the noble animal would <lb/>
instantly give up her design of bounding across some <lb/>
wild chasm, such as she liked to leap in her frolics.</p>
<p>Charlotte Elizabeth remained more than two years in <lb/>
Nova Scotia, and she mentions that she heartily repented <lb/>
her lack of acquirements in domestic matters, and she <lb/>
advises all young ladies to enter upon the "obsolete <lb/>
study of housewifery." Her straits were afterwards often <lb/>
recalled with a smile, but at the time were "anything <lb/>
but laughable." She was befriended by an old French <lb/>
soldier, who acted as mess cook and was induced to <lb/>
<pb n="323" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0340"/>
give her a few lessons in cookery; otherwise, she says, <lb/>
they must have lived on "raw meal and salt rations <lb/>
during weeks when the roads were completely snowed <lb/>
up and no provisions could be brought in."</p>
<p>Once during the terrible cold she had a narrow escape <lb/>
of losing the use of her fingers. Running to thaw them <lb/>
by the fire of blazing fagots, she was met by a poor <lb/>
soldier, who prevented her approach by drawing his <lb/>
bayonet. He then wrapped her hands in a cloth, and <lb/>
obliged her to walk up and down the wide hall till the <lb/>
circulation returned, which it did "with a sensation of <lb/>
agony that well-nigh took away her senses." She na&iuml;vely <lb/>
remarks: "Had he, poor fellow, known how busily those <lb/>
fingers would one day be employed against his religion, <lb/>
for he was a French Romanist, he might have been <lb/>
tempted to sheath his bayonet and give me free access <lb/>
to the tempting fire."</p>
<p>At no time of her life could Charlotte Elizabeth look on <lb/>
suffering unmoved, and the deep interest she took in the <lb/>
poor downtrodden Indians gained for her their trust and <lb/>
affection. Their gratitude was especially drawn out by an <lb/>
act of kindness she performed in sheltering one of their <lb/>
number for a few weeks. The poor creature had been <lb/>
"wounded in a most unprovoked manner by the soldiers, <lb/>
and left to perish in the woods," and she felt that it was a <lb/>
very simple act of duty thus to rescue a fellow-being from <lb/>
a cruel death.</p>
<p>It was a great joy to her when the time came to leave <lb/>
Halifax, and when once again she trod upon English <lb/>
<pb n="324" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0341"/>
ground. The next event of her life was a stay of some <lb/>
years in Ireland. Captain Phelan had in that country <lb/>
property, consisting of a number of small holdings and <lb/>
cabins. Some legal difficulties arising, he had gone there <lb/>
very soon after landing to see about them. Captain <lb/>
Browne was still in the Peninsula. He had married about <lb/>
the same time as his sister, and had taken his bride and <lb/>
his mother with him to Portugal, so that there was little <lb/>
inducement to Charlotte Elizabeth to remain long in <reg orig="Eng-|land">England</reg>. <lb/>
But she dreaded going to Ireland. She looked <lb/>
upon that country as a remote region and only half <lb/>
civilized, and it seemed a "sort of degradation" to her <lb/>
"to bear an Irish name and to go there as a resident."</p>
<p>On her long journey thither she was befriended by an <lb/>
old gentleman who took a kind interest in the stranger. <lb/>
With true Irish warmth he assured her, by writing, that <lb/>
he should take the same care of her as of his own daughter, <lb/>
till he could give her up to her natural protector. She <lb/>
thanked him with cold politeness; but his kindness to a <lb/>
poor woman and her ragged infant, whom, with Charlotte <lb/>
Elizabeth's permission, he took inside the coach, obliged <lb/>
her to confess inwardly that there might be some nice <reg orig="peo-|ple">people</reg> <lb/>
in Ireland. Another Irish gentleman, finding how <lb/>
much she admired the Welsh scenery, handed in at the <lb/>
coach window a note of every remarkable place as they <lb/>
approached. Mr. F. was a finished gentleman, and, she <lb/>
says, "a sad drawback to my perverse prejudices."</p>
<p>After paying the hotel charges at Holyhead, she threw <lb/>
away her last note, thinking it was the bill. With no <lb/>
<pb n="325" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0342"/>
money left she was determined to reach her husband <lb/>
without allowing her kind companions to know of her <lb/>
destitution. In landing she had a narrow escape of her <lb/>
life. On stepping upon the plank which connected the <lb/>
vessel with the wharf, it began to slide. She lost her <lb/>
balance, when a sailor caught her, and Mr. F., throwing <lb/>
himself on the ground, seized and steadied the plank. <lb/>
She thus writes in after years: "I shudder to recall the <lb/>
hard-hearted indifference of my own spirit, while the kind, <lb/>
warm-hearted Irishmen were agitated by very strong <lb/>
emotion, and all around me thanking God for my escape. <lb/>
Each of my friends thought I had landed under the care <lb/>
of the other, while one had my dog and the other my <lb/>
portmanteau. I received their fervent <foreign lang="por"><hi rend="italic">'Cead mille failthe'</hi></foreign> <lb/>
with cold politeness, and trod, with feelings of disgust, <lb/>
on the dear little green shamrocks that I now prize beyond <lb/>
gems." Her friends proposed that all three should join <lb/>
in a postchaise, and, having asked Mr. F. to keep an <lb/>
exact account of her share of the charges, she took her seat <lb/>
with a light heart, her dog being on the footboard. Upon <lb/>
a hilly road the horses took fright, and broke into a full <lb/>
gallop, crossing and recrossing the road in a fearful <reg orig="man-|ner">manner</reg>. <lb/>
The driver was thrown on to the footboard, and <lb/>
poor Tejo hung by his chain. Charlotte Elizabeth, having <lb/>
experienced an overturn in Nova Scotia, at once determined <lb/>
that she would not encounter another. Gathering up her <lb/>
riding habit, and putting her hand out of the window, she <lb/>
opened the door and sprang out. Most providentially at <lb/>
that very moment the horses stopped. Picking herself up <lb/>
<pb n="326" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0343"/>
&lpar;she had fallen flat on her face&rpar; she exclaimed laughing: <lb/>
"Oh well, I suppose I am to love this country after all, <lb/>
for I have kissed it in spite of me." Her friends refused <lb/>
to receive her back into the chaise unless she positively <lb/>
promised to jump out no more. On reaching the hotel <lb/>
were her husband was, she seized some money and paid <lb/>
her debt without any one knowing that she had been <lb/>
penniless.</p>
<p>Her home was now in a very retired place, and many <lb/>
circumstances combined to make her life one of deep <lb/>
seclusion. Captain Phelan was away in Dublin, and <lb/>
her chief occupation consisted in hunting out and <reg orig="copy-|ing">copying</reg> <lb/>
legal information from family papers, relative to a <lb/>
lawsuit then pending. She hardly cared to stir out, for <lb/>
she was ashamed to encounter the tenants of the large <lb/>
number of neighbouring cabins, whose household goods <lb/>
were periodically seized and put up for sale on account <lb/>
of arrears for rent. It is true that this was not actually <lb/>
done by the landlord, but the poor people were not <lb/>
likely to make a distinction between the landlord and <lb/>
his trustees or any other party who had the right to <reg orig="in-|stitute">institute</reg> <lb/>
such proceedings against them. She was very <lb/>
unhappy, yet considering herself better than her <reg orig="neigh-|bours">neighbours</reg>, <lb/>
and desiring to be looked upon as an object of <lb/>
envy rather than of pity. Further, it was an aristocratic <lb/>
little town, the social standing of the lone deaf stranger <lb/>
was unknown, and her pride was wounded by the neglect <lb/>
of those with whom she would naturally have associated.</p>
<p>Thus kept in retirement, she came to the <reg orig="determina-|tion">determination</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="327" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0344"/>
to give herself up to the observance of religious <lb/>
duties and become a sort of Protestant recluse. She <lb/>
resolved to pray three or four times daily, instead of <lb/>
twice; but here an unexpected change came over her <lb/>
mind. He, before Whom she had been accustomed <lb/>
glibly to repeat a form of words with little thought as <lb/>
to their meaning, now seemed to her so terrible a being <lb/>
that she dared not pray. She tried to persuade herself <lb/>
that her feelings were those of holy awe in approaching <lb/>
God, and that in reality she was peculiarly the object <lb/>
of His approval; but nothing availed, she could not pray. <lb/>
She examined herself to see if there was any cause in <lb/>
herself, and then the declaration of St. James gave her <lb/>
great trouble: "Whosoever shall keep the whole law, <lb/>
and yet offend in one point, is guilty of all." She <lb/>
tried the remedy so often tried, and as often proved to <lb/>
be ineffectual; she sought to bring herself into obedience <lb/>
to the whole law. She wrote out all the commands <lb/>
that she was accustomed to neglect, and pinned up a <lb/>
dozen or two of texts round her room. Soon these <lb/>
were taken down, it was so painful to be confronted <lb/>
by their condemning words every time she entered the <lb/>
room; also she did not like others to see them. Next <lb/>
she wrote down in a little book a list of temptations, <lb/>
and made a black dot against each commission of sin; <lb/>
but the book became a mass of black dots, and, <reg orig="re-|membering">remembering</reg> <lb/>
that omissions of duty were also sins, the <lb/>
task of giving a true representation of herself seemed <lb/>
hopeless, and she threw the book into the fire. She <lb/>
<pb n="328" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0345"/>
dared not read the Bible, for it "bore so hard" upon <lb/>
her. Outwardly she was cheerful, but within reigned <lb/>
"the blackness of darkness." Death, upon which she <lb/>
had looked so lightly, became terrible to her. Never <lb/>
having been accustomed to ill health since her <reg orig="child-|hood">childhood</reg>, <lb/>
a severe cold and sore throat terrified her, for she <lb/>
thought certainly she was about to die.</p>
<p>While lying on the sofa in wretchedness and despair, <lb/>
a neighbour sent her some little books just arrived from <lb/>
Dublin. One was the memoir of a lad by his father. <lb/>
She listlessly opened it and read a page, when she was <lb/>
struck by the youth's humble confession of having <reg orig="de-|served">deserved</reg> <lb/>
from the Lord nothing but eternal death. She <lb/>
exclaimed to herself: "Ah, poor fellow, he is just like <lb/>
me! How dreadful his end must have been!" But <lb/>
as she read farther she found him continually <reg orig="magnify-|ing">magnifying</reg> <lb/>
the goodness of God in that while <hi rend="italic">he</hi> was guilty <lb/>
there was One able to save to the uttermost, who had <lb/>
borne his sins, opened the gates of heaven, and now <lb/>
waited to receive his ransomed soul. The book dropped <lb/>
from her hands. "Oh what is this? This is what I <lb/>
want; this would save me. Who did this for him? <lb/>
Jesus Christ certainly, and it must be written in the <lb/>
New Testament." She sprang up to reach her Bible, <lb/>
but was overpowered by her feelings. The sequel we <lb/>
must give in her own expressive words.</p>
<p>"I clasped my hands over my eyes, and then the <lb/>
blessed effects of having even a literal knowledge of <lb/>
Scripture was apparent. Memory brought before me, as <lb/>
<pb n="329" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0346"/>
the Holy Spirit directed it, not here and there a detached <lb/>
text, but whole chapters, as they had long been <reg orig="com-|mitted">committed</reg> <lb/>
to its safe but hitherto unprofitable keeping. <lb/>
The veil was removed from my heart; and Jesus Christ, <lb/>
as the Alpha and Omega, the sum and substance of <lb/>
everything, shone out upon me just as He is set forth in <lb/>
the everlasting gospel. It was the same as if I had been <lb/>
reading, because I knew it so well by rote, only much <lb/>
more rapid, as thought always is. In this there was <reg orig="noth-|ing">nothing</reg> <lb/>
uncommon; but in the <hi rend="italic">opening of the understanding, that <lb/>
I might understand the Scriptures,</hi> was the mighty miracle <lb/>
of grace and truth. There I lay, still as death, my hands <lb/>
still folded over my eyes, my very soul basking in the <lb/>
pure, calm, holy light that streamed into it through the <lb/>
appointed channel of God's word. Rapture was not <lb/>
what I felt; excitement, agitation, there was none. I <lb/>
was like a person long enclosed in a dark dungeon, the <lb/>
walls of which had fallen down, and I looked round on <lb/>
a sunny landscape of calm and glorious beauty. I well <lb/>
remember that the Lord Jesus, in the character of a <lb/>
shepherd, of a star, and, above all, as the pearl of great <lb/>
price, seemed revealed to me most beautifully; that He <lb/>
could save everybody I at once saw; that He would save <lb/>
me never even took the form of a question.</p>
<p>"After some time I rose from the sofa, and walked <lb/>
about; my feelings were delicious. I had found Him of <lb/>
whom Moses, in the law, and the prophets did write; I <lb/>
had found the very Paschal Lamb, whose blood would <lb/>
by my safeguard from the destroying angel. Oh, how <lb/>
<pb n="330" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0347"/>
delicious was that particular thought to me! It was one <lb/>
of the first that occurred, and I laughed with gladness. <lb/>
Indeed, my feeling was very joyous, and I only wanted <lb/>
somebody to tell it to. I had two servants, one a young <lb/>
woman, the other a little girl, both papists, both loving <lb/>
me with Irish warmth. They were delighted to see me <lb/>
so well and happy on a sudden, and in the evening I <lb/>
bade them come to my room, for I was going to read a <lb/>
beautiful book and would read it aloud. I began the <lb/>
Gospel of St. Matthew, and read nine chapters to them, <lb/>
their wonder and delight increasing my joy. Whenever <lb/>
I proposed leaving off they begged for more; and only for <lb/>
my poor throat I think we should have gone on till day. <lb/>
I prayed with them, and what a night's rest I had! Sleep <lb/>
so sweet, a waking so happy, and joy so unclouded <lb/>
through the day, what but the gospel could bestow? <lb/>
Few, very few, have been so privileged as I was, to be <lb/>
left alone with the infallible teaching of God the Holy <lb/>
Ghost, by means of the written word, for many weeks, <lb/>
and so to get a thorough knowledge of the great <reg orig="doc-|trines">doctrines</reg> <lb/>
of salvation, unclouded by man's vain wisdom. I <lb/>
knew not that in the world there were any who had made <lb/>
the same discovery with myself. Of all schemes of <reg orig="doc-|trine">doctrine</reg> <lb/>
I was wholly ignorant, and the only system of <reg orig="the-|ology">theology</reg> <lb/>
open to me was God's own. All the faculties of my <lb/>
mind were roused and brightened for the work. I prayed <lb/>
without ceasing for Divine instruction, and took without <lb/>
cavilling what was vouchsafed."</p>
<p>She now thankfully felt the benefit of the enforced <lb/>
<pb n="331" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0348"/>
seclusion which had kept her separate from worldly <reg orig="as-|sociates">associates</reg>. <lb/>
At this time she had no religious book except <lb/>
the Bible, was not acquainted with any clergyman; and <lb/>
had there been a gospel ministry near she would not have <lb/>
attended in consequence of her deafness. She therefore <lb/>
gave herself up to the study of the Scriptures during some <lb/>
weeks, and obtained, she says, "a new view of the whole <lb/>
scheme of redemption and God's dealings with man, <lb/>
which she never afterwards found reason to alter save as <lb/>
greater light broke in on each branch of the subject, <lb/>
strengthening not changing these views."</p>
<p>She was still engaged in the uninteresting occupation <lb/>
of copying legal documents. The fact of her being <lb/>
always employed in writing led to her being looked upon <lb/>
as a literary character, and a lady personally unknown <lb/>
to her sent her a parcel of tracts. One paper was a plea <lb/>
for the distribution of tracts, and she was thus introduced <lb/>
to a means of disseminating truth quite new to her. The <lb/>
thought entered her mind that since she could not give <lb/>
money she might help by writing a tract. Having a long <lb/>
evening before her, she, with her usual energy, set to <lb/>
work at once. By three in the morning she had <reg orig="com-|pleted">completed</reg> <lb/>
a little story in which was set forth the truth as it <lb/>
is in Jesus; and on reading over what she had written, <lb/>
she was amazed to find that she had been enabled to <lb/>
exhibit so completely the fulness of the gospel message. <lb/>
In so simple a manner did Charlotte Elizabeth's literary <lb/>
labours begin. Waking full of joy after her short night's <lb/>
sleep, she was puzzled to know what she conld do with <lb/>
<pb n="332" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0349"/>
her little book. Just then a note arrived from Miss D. <lb/>
&lpar;the lady who had sent the tracts the day before&rpar;, <reg orig="en-|closing">enclosing</reg> <lb/>
the address of the Dublin Tract Society, and <reg orig="men-|tioning">mentioning</reg> <lb/>
her desire that the stranger might be induced to <lb/>
contribute to the publications of that Association. The <lb/>
manuscript was at once sent off to the address, and <reg orig="cor-|dially">cordially</reg> <lb/>
received, and more asked for. The Secretary <reg orig="sug-|gested">suggested</reg> <lb/>
frequent intercourse with the peasants as a means <lb/>
of enabling her to understand more fully their simple <lb/>
modes of thought. When she replied that her loss of <lb/>
hearing was a bar to such intercourse,<ref target="n6" n="2">*</ref>
<note id="n6" place="foot" n="2"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>Afterwards this difficulty seems to have been overcome, for <lb/>
Charlotte Elizabeth had large intercourse with the poor both in <lb/>
England and Ireland. Probably in her visits to them she was <reg orig="ac-|companied">accompanied</reg> <lb/>
by some of her friends.</p></note>
 and gave a little <lb/>
sketch of the Lord's dealings with her, his warm <reg orig="expres-|sions">expressions</reg> <lb/>
of Christian sympathy and interest rejoiced her <lb/>
heart in the feeling that she had found "a brother in <lb/>
the faith." Only a few days after, she heard that this <lb/>
newly found friend had broken a bloodvessel and was <lb/>
dying. He commended her to his brother, who proved <lb/>
a kind adviser and helper to her in her literary work. <lb/>
On the way from his brother's funeral this gentleman <lb/>
passed through the place in which she resided, and called <lb/>
upon her, and his conversation was so truly the <reg orig="over-|flowing">overflowing</reg> <lb/>
of a heart devoted to Christ that it left her <reg orig="long-|ing">longing</reg> <lb/>
for more Christian fellowship.</p>
<p>Soon after she had a call to Dublin, when Mr. D. <lb/>
introduced her to a circle of friends met to welcome a <lb/>
<pb n="333" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0350"/>
missionary just returned from Russia. She writes of <lb/>
these friends: "Remember these were the frank, <reg orig="unre-|strained">unrestrained</reg>, <lb/>
warm-hearted Irish, of all people the most ready <lb/>
at expressing their zealous and generous feelings; and <lb/>
imagine, if you can, my enjoyment after such a long <lb/>
season of comparative loneliness, when they came about <lb/>
me with the affectionate welcome that none can utter <lb/>
and look so eloquently as they can!" She thought it <lb/>
a taste of heavenly blessedness, and yet she longed to <lb/>
get back to the retired life where she had none but God <lb/>
to speak to about her soul's interests; for it seemed as if <lb/>
the very pleasure of communing with earthly friends <lb/>
broke the harmony of the fellowship with Him alone, <lb/>
which had been so unspeakably precious to her. Now <lb/>
that she had accepted the simple teaching of the New <lb/>
Testament her mind began to notice the Romish errors <lb/>
which confronted her on every hand. As she became <lb/>
more intimately acquainted with the working of the <reg orig="sys-|tem">system</reg> <lb/>
among the poor in Ireland, she was inexpressibly <lb/>
distressed by the widespread evils which it entailed. <lb/>
Later on her zeal on this subject may have sometimes <lb/>
carried her away. It seems never to have occurred to <lb/>
her that her denunciations against this or anything else <lb/>
that she believed to be untrue could be deemed <reg orig="unchari-|table">uncharitable</reg>. <lb/>
They partook of the character of righteous <reg orig="in-|dignation">indignation</reg> <lb/>
against error, and zeal for the Lord's cause <lb/>
such as the old prophets felt, when groaning under the <lb/>
weight of evils which were undermining God's authority <lb/>
among His people. And what she felt stirring her whole <lb/>
<pb n="334" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0351"/>
soul she would have thought it dishonourable to <reg orig="with-|hold">withhold</reg> <lb/>
from others. As a child she had craved to be a <lb/>
martyr. There is reason to believe that, after she had <lb/>
given in her allegiance to her Lord and King, she would <lb/>
at any time have accepted martyrdom joyfully for His <lb/>
dear sake. It has been necessary to say so much in <lb/>
order to vindicate the character of one who, while she <lb/>
inveighed against systems which she believed to be wholly <lb/>
erroneous, was yet tender of sincere-hearted individuals <lb/>
attached to such systems.</p>
<p>A few months after she had written her first tract <lb/>
Captain Phelan was ordered abroad again, and his wife <lb/>
remained in Ireland, where she became mainly <reg orig="depend-|ent">dependent</reg> <lb/>
upon her own exertions. Her mother had joined <lb/>
her. She also had accepted the faith and hope of the <lb/>
gospel, so that the two were in sympathy. In the <reg orig="sum-|mer">summer</reg> <lb/>
of 1821 they both paid a visit at Vicarsfield, the <lb/>
lovely residence of Dr. Hamilton, Rector of <reg orig="Knock-|topher">Knocktopher</reg>, <lb/>
near Kilkenny. This holy man and his wife <lb/>
were devoting themselves and their income to the good <lb/>
of others: and while their hospitality to their friends was <lb/>
unbounded, their benefits to the poor were widely <reg orig="dis-|pensed">dispensed</reg>. <lb/>
Roman Catholics and Protestants were relieved <lb/>
without distinction; but as the Romanists numbered <lb/>
twelve hundred and the Protestants only one hundred, <lb/>
the former must have had by far the larger share of the <lb/>
benefits dispensed. In the large roomy vicarage a dozen <lb/>
girls were being trained for service by a matron under <lb/>
Mrs. Hamilton's wise supervision. While all seemed <lb/>
<pb n="335" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0352"/>
peaceful and prosperous within, a small cloud, no <reg orig="big-|ger">bigger</reg> <lb/>
than a man's hand, was descried even then by the <lb/>
venerable pastor; but he hid his fears of a coming tempest <lb/>
from those around.</p>
<p>It was about this time that signs of disaffection towards <lb/>
the Protestants became apparent in many parts. A book <lb/>
called the "Prophecies of Pastorini" had been written by <lb/>
a priest. It was a commentary on the book of <reg orig="Reve-|lation">Revelation</reg>, <lb/>
and the writer explained the ascent of the locusts <lb/>
out of the bottomless pit as prefiguring the rise of the <lb/>
Protestants with Luther at their head. He calculated <lb/>
their continuance from 1525 to 1825. The book was <lb/>
much read, and portions of it were circulated among <lb/>
the lower orders throughout the country. The <reg orig="conse-|quence">consequence</reg> <lb/>
was that the belief became rooted in the minds <lb/>
of many of these that the Protestants in Ireland and <reg orig="else-|where">elsewhere</reg> <lb/>
were to be put to death by Divine appointment in <lb/>
the year 1825. They accordingly prepared to execute <lb/>
this design, while those of a higher class used every effort <lb/>
to avert the catastrophe by proselytizing their Protestant <lb/>
friends and neighbours. The peasants now began to <lb/>
change their naturally polite and respectful manners, <lb/>
often putting on a defiant air. Threatening notices <lb/>
were served on landlords who presumed to dispose of <lb/>
their property as they chose; and upon the clergy who, <lb/>
in default of payment, were obliged to serve processes for <lb/>
the tithe. There were other indications of an <reg orig="approach-|ing">approaching</reg> <lb/>
storm, but as yet all seemed quiet at Vicarsfield. <lb/>
After a long and delightful visit Charlotte Elizabeth and <lb/>
<pb n="336" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0353"/>
her mother decided upon Kilkenny as their home. In <lb/>
that quiet retreat the former had full opportunity for <lb/>
writing. She was also glad to be away from the <reg orig="hope-|less">hopeless</reg> <lb/>
position of landlord, which she had accepted, over <lb/>
the poor tenants who had learned to love and trust her. <lb/>
The difficulties were inextricable "between head landlord, <lb/>
under tenants, trustees, receiver, and all the endless <reg orig="ma-|chinery">machinery</reg> <lb/>
of an embarrassed little Irish estate," so that to <lb/>
continue her "nominal office" seemed to be only waste <lb/>
of strength and feeling. She therefore retired to seek <lb/>
"an honest independence in the way of usefulness."</p>
<p>At Kilkenny there was a convent which was very <reg orig="at-|tractive">attractive</reg> <lb/>
to strangers visiting the place, as well as to <lb/>
the residents. Many sought to induce Charlotte <reg orig="Eliza-|beth">Elizabeth</reg> <lb/>
to enter its walls; but she would have considered <lb/>
it a compromise of her principles to visit such a place <lb/>
out of mere curiosity. But when a lady brought her a <lb/>
message from "the most interesting nun" in the <reg orig="insti-|tution">institution</reg> <lb/>
that she would be very glad of some instruction <lb/>
in the best way of imparting ideas to a mute in the <lb/>
school, she was at once ready to give her services.</p>
<p>It was no doubt already well known in the place that <lb/>
Charlotte Elizabeth had found out some deaf and dumb <lb/>
peasant children to whom she gave instruction. The <lb/>
nun was naturally lovely and attractive, and soon twined <lb/>
herself round the warm heart of her instructress. She <lb/>
was the child of a mixed marriage, the husband being <lb/>
a Romanist and the wife a Protestant. The usual <reg orig="ar-|rangement">arrangement</reg> <lb/>
was made that the boys were to be educated <lb/>
<pb n="337" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0354"/>
in the father's and the girls in the mother's religion. The <lb/>
family consisted only of daughters, who were all brought <lb/>
up Protestants. On the death of the father, the priests <lb/>
so successfully worked upon the feelings of the widow <lb/>
and her family that all except this one joined the Romish <lb/>
communion. With her the priests had much trouble, <lb/>
and the means which were at last successful in bringing <lb/>
her out of her own church were altogether unjustifiable. <lb/>
She became a nun, and entered with zeal into conventual <lb/>
life. She seems to have had a great desire to influence <lb/>
her new friend, and begged her to read some Roman <lb/>
Catholic books, that she might fairly judge of the merits <lb/>
or demerits of her church. Charlotte Elizabeth accepted <lb/>
the challenge on condition that the nun should read <lb/>
her comments on what she read. This was agreed to. <lb/>
During one of the early visits to the convent Charlotte <lb/>
Elizabeth had an experience which is so characteristically <lb/>
described by her that we must give it in her own words. <lb/>
She went round the garden at the nun's request, and <reg orig="fol-|lowed">followed</reg> <lb/>
her "sweet conductor" up the steps of what she <lb/>
imagined to be a schoolroom. She writes: "judge what <lb/>
was my dismay when, on passing the folding doors, I <lb/>
found myself in a splendid Popish chapel, opposite the <lb/>
altar, over which shone a richly gilt cross, while my poor <lb/>
nun was prostrated in the lowliest adoration, touching <lb/>
the ground with her forehead, before the senseless idol. <lb/>
I was confounded, and unable to say anything; but after <lb/>
a hasty glance at the fine trappings left the place, secretly <lb/>
praying for grace and strength to protest openly against <lb/>
<pb n="338" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0355"/>
the abomination from which my soul revolted from the <lb/>
moment of my witnessing the act of idolatrous homage <lb/>
rendered to a thing of wood and stone."</p>
<p>The volume first lent to Charlotte Elizabeth by the <lb/>
nun was Dr. Milner's "End of Controversy," which was <lb/>
procured from a seminary of Jesuit priests. When she <lb/>
had finished reading it, she burst into tears, and kneeling <lb/>
down exclaimed: "O Lord, I cannot unravel this net <lb/>
of iniquity; enable me to cut it in twain!" Then the <lb/>
"broad view of the whole scheme of man's salvation as <lb/>
revealed in Holy Scriptures" appeared to her as the <lb/>
best antidote to the poison. With renewed zest she read <lb/>
through the New Testament, and wrote out a plain <reg orig="state-|ment">statement</reg> <lb/>
of the gospel plan and sent it to the convent. <reg orig="An-|other">Another</reg> <lb/>
book was lent, and another reply written out. <lb/>
The heart of the writer yearned over the nun, and hoped <lb/>
that her words might be blessed to the poor girl; but soon <lb/>
the latter managed to let her know that not a word of <lb/>
what she had written was shown to her. This disclosure <lb/>
filled Charlotte Elizabeth's honourable mind with pain <lb/>
and indignation.</p>
<p>Another attempt was made to influence her by offering <lb/>
her tickets to see a nun take the veil, and an <reg orig="interpreta-|tion">interpretation</reg> <lb/>
of the ceremony was written out by her friend and <lb/>
sent with a kind little note. Charlotte Elizabeth had <lb/>
some curiosity to be present, but she felt that she could <lb/>
not go into such a scene with a peaceful mind; and <lb/>
though it pained her to hurt the feelings of her "gentle <lb/>
nun," she refused the invitation as gratefully and <reg orig="deli-|cately">delicately</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="339" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0356"/>
as she could. She says, in reference to her refusal, <lb/>
"My heart danced so lightly in my bosom after it, that <lb/>
I trust there is no danger of my ever trying what sort of <lb/>
a sensation a contrary line of conduct would produce." <lb/>
Many times afterwards she went to the convent, hoping <lb/>
to see her friend, but in vain. She was now rapidly <lb/>
failing in health, and was reported to be confined to her <lb/>
apartment. Just before leaving Kilkenny Charlotte <reg orig="Eliz-|abeth">Elizabeth</reg> <lb/>
called once more as an act of civility, and while <lb/>
waiting in the parlour her young friend burst into the <lb/>
room, and, sitting down by her, threw her arms round <lb/>
her neck, exclaiming "I was resolved to see you once <lb/>
more." Before she could say another word, three elderly <lb/>
nuns came in and forced her away, and her friend saw <lb/>
her no more. During a whole year she prayed constantly <lb/>
for the lovely girl with fervent cries for her salvation, and <lb/>
four years after learned that she had died about the time <lb/>
that she had ceased to pray for her.</p>
<p>The next endeavour put forth to proselytize Charlotte <lb/>
Elizabeth came through a poor lad, the brother of one <lb/>
of her deaf and dumb pupils. His appeals in his strong <lb/>
Irish brogue &lpar;which his spelling revealed to her&rpar; caused <lb/>
her considerable amusement whenever he called upon <lb/>
her.</p>
<p>"I wouldn't like," said Pat, "that you would go to <lb/>
hell."</p>
<p>"Nor I either, Pat."</p>
<p>"But you are out of the thrue church, and you won't <lb/>
be saved, and I must convart ye."</p>
<pb n="340" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0357"/>
<p>And with this intent he induced her to read Butler's <lb/>
Catechism. For days the controversy went on, "Butler" <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">versus</hi> the Bible. Pat showed himself very acute in <reg orig="de-|fending">defending</reg> <lb/>
his church, but the result of the discussion was <lb/>
that he was led to read the Bible; and the bread-corn <lb/>
then cast upon the waters was found after six years, <lb/>
when, in a little English church, Pat and his dumb <lb/>
brother Jack worshipped side by side, together rejoicing <lb/>
in the same Saviour. Jack was apparently the most <reg orig="stu-|pid">stupid</reg> <lb/>
of the four deaf and dumb children who daily came <lb/>
to their kind friend for instruction. She almost repented <lb/>
having attempted to teach this boy, but one day on lifting <lb/>
the heavy mass of black hair from his forehead she saw <lb/>
such a noble and beautiful brow that she could not but <lb/>
persevere in her arduous labour of love. Jack's mind <lb/>
suddenly broke its bonds, and the eager "What?" <lb/>
spelled on his fingers, about everything he could lay <lb/>
his hands upon, kept his teacher well employed. But <lb/>
a difficulty arose when he woke up to ask the difference <lb/>
between himself and the noble dog which played with <lb/>
him. Then followed the questions, "How was the sun <lb/>
made, and who made it? did his mother? the <reg orig="clergy-|man">clergyman</reg>? <lb/>
the priest?" "No!" Then "What? what?" <lb/>
with an impatient stamp. Charlotte Elizabeth spelled <lb/>
the word "God," and looked up solemnly. Jack <reg orig="ap-|peared">appeared</reg> <lb/>
struck. Next day he wanted to know more. <lb/>
His teacher was not satisfied with the information she <lb/>
was able to give; but with a vocabulary of about a <lb/>
dozen nouns she found it difficult to communicate much <lb/>
<pb n="341" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0358"/>
about unseen things. The next day he came to her in <lb/>
great wrath, signing that her tongue ought to be pulled <lb/>
out &lpar;his sign when a lie had been told&rpar;. He had looked <lb/>
everywhere, but could not find God. He had seen no <lb/>
one tall enough to stick the stars into the sky, etc., etc. <lb/>
He repeated over and over again "God&mdash;no! God&mdash;no!" <lb/>
till it went to her heart. She looked up for help and <lb/>
guidance to convey the teaching which she felt to be of <lb/>
such paramount importance. She sat silent, when a <lb/>
thought struck her. Presently she reached the bellows, <lb/>
and, after puffing at the fire, suddenly "directed a blast <lb/>
upon Jack's little red hand." He was angry, and when <lb/>
it was repeated he began shivering. She gave another <lb/>
puff and looked unconscious of having done anything, <lb/>
and said "What?" Then she puffed in all directions, <lb/>
looking at the pipe and imitating him, saying, "Wind <lb/>
&mdash;no," shaking her head and telling him <hi rend="italic">his</hi> tongue must <lb/>
be pulled out. After much impatience on his part the <lb/>
mysterious truth dawned upon him. Charlotte Elizabeth <lb/>
thus describes the event. "He opened his eyes very <lb/>
wide, stared at me, and panted; a deep crimson suffused <lb/>
his whole face, and a soul, a real soul, shone in his <lb/>
strangely altered countenance, while he triumphantly <reg orig="re-|peated">repeated</reg>, <lb/>
'God like wind! God like wind!' He had <lb/>
no word for 'like'; it was signified by holding the two <lb/>
forefingers out, side by side, as a symbol of perfect <reg orig="re-|semblance">resemblance</reg>." <lb/>
She says it was deeply interesting and <reg orig="touch-|ing">touching</reg> <lb/>
to see how completely he received the idea of God <lb/>
as a holy and loving Father, entering into the minute <lb/>
<pb n="342" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0359"/>
things of every day. Previously he had teased the dog <lb/>
and other animals, and wanted to fish; but now he <reg orig="be-|came">became</reg> <lb/>
"most exquisitely tender towards every thing living, <lb/>
moving his hand over them in a caressing way, and <reg orig="say-|ing">saying</reg>, <lb/>
'God made!'"</p>
<p>The next step was to teach him the knowledge of a <lb/>
Saviour. Jack had noticed funerals passing, and had <lb/>
seen dead bodies placed in their coffins, and one <reg orig="even-|ing">evening</reg> <lb/>
he asked if the dead would ever open their eyes <lb/>
again. His teacher caught at this question, prayerfully <lb/>
hoping to be able to open up to him some thoughts <lb/>
touching the way of salvation. She sketched on a paper <lb/>
persons young and old, and near by a pit with flames <lb/>
issuing out of it. She told him all people were bad, <lb/>
and God would throw them into the fire. When he <lb/>
was thoroughly frightened she sketched the figure of a <lb/>
man, who, she told him, "was God's Son; that He <lb/>
came out of heaven; He had not been bad, but allowed <lb/>
Himself to be killed, and then God shut up the pit, <lb/>
so the people were spared." After a few moments' <lb/>
thought Jack asked with his expressive "What?" how <lb/>
it was that while those who were saved were many, He <lb/>
who died was only one. A bunch of dead flowers had <lb/>
been inadvertently &lpar;not accidentally&rpar; left in the vase, <lb/>
and Charlotte Elizabeth took these, and, cutting them <lb/>
in innumerable pieces, laid them in a heap on the table, <lb/>
and beside them her gold ring, and asked him which <lb/>
he would like, "many&mdash;or one?" Jack struck his <lb/>
hand on his forehead, then clapped both hands, gave a <lb/>
<pb n="343" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0360"/>
leap from the ground, and signed that the piece of gold <lb/>
was better than a roomful of dead flowers. "With <lb/>
great rapidity he pointed to the picture, to the ring, <lb/>
to himself, to his teacher, and lastly to heaven." A <lb/>
bright smile covered his face, his eyes were sparkling <lb/>
with delight. Then came a rush of tears, and, with a <lb/>
softened look he spelled slowly on his fingers the words <lb/>
"Good <hi rend="italic">One!</hi> good <hi rend="italic">One!</hi>" and asked His name.</p>
<p>She thus refers to this memorable time:</p>
<p>"He received &lsqb;the name of Jesus&rsqb; into his mind, and <lb/>
the gospel, the glorious, everlasting gospel, into his soul, <lb/>
and the Holy Spirit into his heart. &hellip; In the <lb/>
same hour it was given him to believe, and from that <lb/>
hour all things were his&mdash;the world, life, death, and <lb/>
a bright immortality. Never but once before had I <lb/>
laid my head on the pillow with such an overwhelming <lb/>
sense of happiness. The Lord indeed had shown me <lb/>
His glory, by causing His goodness to pass before me."</p>
<p>A second visit which she paid about this time to <reg orig="Vicars-|field">Vicarsfield</reg> <lb/>
was a great contrast to the first. Dr. Hamilton was <lb/>
broken in health, owing largely to the anxiety caused by <lb/>
the sorrowful state of the country. He had been <reg orig="re-|peatedly">repeatedly</reg> <lb/>
threatened by those who grudged him the tithes <lb/>
which he used so generously for the benefit of his <reg orig="parish-|ioners">parishioners</reg>; <lb/>
but he bore all with "touching patience." So <lb/>
critical was the state of the neighbourhood that the <reg orig="man-|sion">mansion</reg> <lb/>
was barricaded in nightly preparation for an attack, <lb/>
though no firearms were allowed in the house. These <lb/>
trials were borne with cheerful Christian resignation, <lb/>
<pb n="344" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0361"/>
and Mrs. Hamilton entertained her guests with the <lb/>
warm-hearted, thoughtful kindness of other days. <reg orig="Char-|lotte">Charlotte</reg> <lb/>
Elizabeth says that she felt it a privilege to be there, <lb/>
and she lay down peacefully at night knowing that she <lb/>
might die a violent death before morning. We have <lb/>
no wish to dwell on troubles which have long passed <lb/>
away, and will finish the history of Vicarsfield here, in <lb/>
order not to recur to the subject. Two or three years <lb/>
later the pastor and his wife were forced to leave their <lb/>
once peaceful and happy home, and they left it for ever. <lb/>
They were stripped of everything and driven away by <lb/>
those who were thus despoiling their best friends. Truly <lb/>
these poor ignorant creatures knew not what they did. <lb/>
Charlotte Elizabeth says that one thing perplexed her. <lb/>
As the Irish peasants showed themselves more and more <lb/>
blood-thirsty towards the Protestants &lpar;she was herself <lb/>
specially marked out as a victim&rpar;, so did her love for <lb/>
them increase. This was probably owing to her strong <lb/>
belief that the people themselves were not the instigators <lb/>
of the wrongs done. They blindly followed their leaders <lb/>
at the peril of their lives. She describes them as <reg orig="natur-|ally">naturally</reg> <lb/>
the most loving and loveable race under the sun. <lb/>
With her keen powers of observation she marked how, <lb/>
from the cradle to the grave, the untutored peasants were <lb/>
kept in leading strings. They could do nothing of their <lb/>
own free will, and seeing how those who held them down <lb/>
tried also to keep them in a state of darkness, she <reg orig="real-|ized">realized</reg> <lb/>
it to be her mission to do all in her power to bring <lb/>
them into the light and liberty of the children of God. <lb/>
<pb n="345" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0362"/>
Her little books and tracts became very popular, and the <lb/>
literary work carried on for her own support was a "<reg orig="per-|fect">perfect</reg> <lb/>
luxury whenever these little messengers carried with <lb/>
them spiritual blessing to the people so dear to her." <lb/>
Her plan for simplifying her narratives is worthy of the <lb/>
consideration of <hi rend="italic">every one</hi> who writes for the uneducated. <lb/>
If, on reading each manuscript to a child of five years, she <lb/>
found "a single word or sentence above his <reg orig="comprehen-|sion">comprehension</reg>, <lb/>
it was instantly corrected to suit that lowly standard."</p>
<p>In 1824 Charlotte Elizabeth was recalled to England. <lb/>
She would have chosen to remain in Ireland, and share, <lb/>
with a beloved circle of friends, any events which 1825 <lb/>
might unfold.</p>
<p>One desire was strong within her. As her dumb boy's <lb/>
love to his Saviour increased, he had, of his own accord, <lb/>
turned away from the church of his fathers; and she <lb/>
wished to take him with her to England, in order that <lb/>
nothing might hinder his growth in the spiritual life. <lb/>
Shortly after he had received into his heart the "Name <lb/>
which is above every name" he discovered that the figure <lb/>
before which he bowed in chapel was a representation of <lb/>
the Lord Jesus Christ. His indignation knew no bounds, <lb/>
and he signed that he would never go into the chapel <lb/>
again. His friend told him what would be the <reg orig="con-|sequences">consequences</reg> <lb/>
of such a course, and that he would be taken <lb/>
away from her. He seemed depressed, but at the time <lb/>
of the next service he went off in good spirits, and, <reg orig="run-|ning">running</reg> <lb/>
up the outside stairs to the organ loft, remained <lb/>
there during the service "listening" to the vibrations of <lb/>
<pb n="346" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0363"/>
the organ. This he continued to do as long as he <reg orig="re-|mained">remained</reg> <lb/>
in Kilkenny. When Charlotte Elizabeth applied <lb/>
to his parents for leave to take him to England, they gave <lb/>
a ready permission. They knew that his mind had been <lb/>
developed by her and that she had taught him everything <lb/>
he knew, and his mother said, with tears, "Take him, <lb/>
he is more your child than ours"; and his father <reg orig="ex-|claimed">exclaimed</reg>, <lb/>
"Why shouldn't we let him go with you, seeing <lb/>
he would grieve to death if left behind!' When she <lb/>
said that she could not promise that he would not <reg orig="em-|brace">embrace</reg> <lb/>
her religion, they interrupted her, saying "he <lb/>
could come to no harm under her care." Jack was <lb/>
now about twelve years old. At Dublin, on their way <lb/>
to England, he offered, for the first time, to kneel with <lb/>
his friends in prayer, and the expression of his face at <lb/>
such times was most lovely, "with a smile of childlike <lb/>
confidence and reverential awe playing over his features."</p>
<p>From Ireland Charlotte Elizabeth went to Bristol, and <lb/>
from thence to Clifton, where she remained a year. She <lb/>
thus alludes to this time: "Incipient insanity, which <lb/>
afterwards became developed, in a quarter where, if I <lb/>
did not find comfort and protection, I might expect the <lb/>
opposites, occasioned me much alarm and distress, while <lb/>
my brother's protracted absence increased the trial."</p>
<p>During her stay at Clifton Captain Browne's wife and <lb/>
only surviving boy came to her, while he was detained in <lb/>
Portugal some months longer by an injury received when <lb/>
out shooting. The little boy was an unfailing source of <lb/>
delight to his aunt and also to Jack, who used to watch <lb/>
<pb n="347" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0364"/>
him with intense interest, and often he would "tell God" <lb/>
about him and "that he was too little to know about <lb/>
Jesus Christ." Prayer was a blessed reality to the dumb <lb/>
boy. Wherever he was, and whatever he was doing, <lb/>
his thoughts were continually reaching heavenwards, and <lb/>
many times a day he would turn a look of peculiar <reg orig="sweet-|ness">sweetness</reg> <lb/>
towards his beloved friend, at the same time spelling <lb/>
the words "Jack pray." She says there was a look of <lb/>
satisfaction and triumph upon his face when in prayer, <lb/>
so that she could always tell when he was so engaged. <lb/>
When conversing with earthly friends, he wore an <reg orig="ex-|pression">expression</reg> <lb/>
of anxiety lest he should not be able to make <lb/>
himself understood, but he had no such fear when "<reg orig="talk-|ing">talking</reg> <lb/>
to God."</p>
<p>At Clifton Charlotte Elizabeth was much interested <lb/>
in making the personal acquaintance of Hannah More, <lb/>
with whom she had for some time corresponded. She <lb/>
says, writing at this time: "when gazing upon the placid <lb/>
but animated countenance of the aged saint, I thought <lb/>
more of her 'Cheap Repository Tracts' than of all her <lb/>
other works put together." It seemed such a noble <lb/>
enterprise for one, whose writings were acceptable in <lb/>
the highest literary circles, to turn aside into humble <lb/>
paths and become a pioneer in writing homely <reg orig="narra-|tives">narratives</reg> <lb/>
and ballads for the encouragement of the poor in <lb/>
all that is pure and good and holy.</p>
<p>After ten years' absence the longed for brother at last <lb/>
returned, to the unspeakable joy of his sister, and soon for <lb/>
her there was a bright oasis in her desert life. She <reg orig="de-|scribes">describes</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="348" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0365"/>
the dark days before this event. "Many, and <lb/>
sharp, and bitter were the trials left unrecorded here, and <lb/>
shame be to the hand that shall ever dare to lift the veil <lb/>
which tender charity would cast over what was God's <lb/>
doing, let the instruments be what and who they might. <lb/>
It is enough to say that even now I know that there was <lb/>
not one superfluous stroke of the rod, nor one drop of <lb/>
bitter that could have been spared from the wholesome <lb/>
cup. Besides, He dealt most mercifully with me; those <lb/>
two blessings, health and cheerfulness, were never <reg orig="with-|drawn">withdrawn</reg>. <lb/>
I had not a day's illness through years of <lb/>
tribulation; and though my spirits would now and then <lb/>
fail, it was but a momentary depression; light and <reg orig="buoy-|ant">buoyant</reg>, <lb/>
they soon danced on the crest of the wave that had <lb/>
for an instant engulfed them."</p>
<p>Captain Browne was now appointed to a regiment just <lb/>
returned from foreign service. He had leave to study for <lb/>
two years at Sandhurst, "the better to qualify himself for a <lb/>
future staff appointment;" and he engaged a sweet retired <lb/>
cottage on Bagshot Heath for his family. Here he brought <lb/>
his sister, and a delightful room was appropriated to her, <lb/>
with an injunction to make the most of the time while he <lb/>
was away at the college, that she might be ready "to walk, <lb/>
to ride, to farm, to garden with him on his return." His <lb/>
bright presence seemed to bring back to her the days of <lb/>
her youth, and very delightful was the unrestrained <reg orig="inter-|course">intercourse</reg> <lb/>
between the brother and sister. This season under <lb/>
the shelter of her brother's roof was one of comparative <lb/>
freedom from anxiety, and most propitious for writing; <lb/>
<pb n="349" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0366"/>
but a difficulty arose. For the protection of her own <reg orig="in-|terests">interests</reg> <lb/>
she found that she must no longer attach her name <lb/>
to her publications. At this juncture a friend offered her <lb/>
plenty of work and remuneration in writing novels for the <lb/>
most popular magazine of the day. The tales were to be <lb/>
moral, but to have no distinct reference to religion. This <lb/>
proposal was followed by one from an old friend, who <lb/>
wished her to re-write for him a flimsy love tale which he <lb/>
had years before unsuccessfully published. She at once <lb/>
felt that she must refuse both offers, and this at a moment <lb/>
when she particularly wished to be no burden to her <lb/>
brother. She felt that her publications written for the <lb/>
spiritual good of her fellow men had been owned and <lb/>
blessed of God. She felt that He had called her to work <lb/>
for Him, and she could not take herself out of the path <lb/>
of usefulness. Her old friend, whose assistance would <lb/>
probably have included provision for her life, now withdrew <lb/>
from her, and she heard of him no more. No one in her <lb/>
circle could understand her motives for the course she had <lb/>
taken, but she was able to commit her cause unto Him <lb/>
who judgeth righteously, and He made a way for her. <lb/>
Her friends of the Dublin Tract Society resolved, at some <lb/>
risk, still to accept her writings, and though the advantage <lb/>
derived from this source was small she was thankful to <lb/>
remain in connection with them. Not long after, Mr. <lb/>
Sandford, a gentleman who had promoted her literary <lb/>
labours, sent her a handsome gift, "which left her," she <lb/>
says, "no loser" by doing her duty.</p>
<p>During the two years spent at Bagshot Heath her rapid <lb/>
<pb n="350" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0367"/>
pen produced seven volumes, and more than thirty small <lb/>
books and tracts, besides contributions to periodicals. It <lb/>
was a great satisfaction to her that one of her little books <lb/>
found its way into the papal Index Expurgatorius. A <lb/>
friend of hers, a widow lady, had taken her only daughter, <lb/>
a child of ten, to Italy for her health. The little girl, <lb/>
who loved Charlotte Elizabeth devotedly, chose one of her <lb/>
little books to translate into Italian. She did not live <lb/>
to finish it, but begged her mother to go on with it, <lb/>
trusting it would be blessed to Italian children. The <lb/>
mother found so much solace in carrying out the wishes <lb/>
of her child that she translated several more and had them <lb/>
printed and circulated. One was the means of the <reg orig="con-|version">conversion</reg> <lb/>
of a physician, a Romanist. This fact became <lb/>
known to the Archbishop of Siena, and he gave orders <lb/>
that from the altars under his jurisdiction the priests <lb/>
should interdict all books from the pen of so dangerous <lb/>
a writer. One poor priest had given away numbers of <lb/>
these little books, and on the day in question, after mass, <lb/>
he told his people that he had a painful duty to perform. <lb/>
He then read the denunciations against the said <reg orig="publica-|tions">publications</reg>. <lb/>
He directed his flock to bring back to him, or <lb/>
burn, or in some way get rid of, the obnoxious books. <lb/>
He added: "Nevertheless I declare, in the sight of God, <lb/>
I found no evil in those dear little books, but on the <lb/>
contrary they are full of good." He then burst into <lb/>
tears and many wept with him. She writes: "I would <lb/>
not exchange for the value of the three kingdoms, ten <lb/>
<pb n="351" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0368"/>
times tripled, the joy that I felt in this high honour put <lb/>
upon me, the rich blessing of the Papal curse."</p>
<p>The happy days in the cottage home were passing very <lb/>
swiftly. Jack was a great favourite with Captain Browne, <lb/>
who had quickly caught his expressive sign language, and <lb/>
the two conversed easily together. Charlotte Elizabeth <lb/>
had brought the boy up usefully, knowing that in the <lb/>
event of her death he would have to get his own living; <lb/>
and when Captain Browne expressed his intention of <lb/>
keeping a horse Jack pleaded hard to take charge of it. <lb/>
He confided to her that he thought a man servant would <lb/>
shake hands with the devil &lpar;his sign for giving way to <lb/>
temptation&rpar;, and if <hi rend="italic">he</hi> shook hands with the man, his <lb/>
hand would also one day be drawn into that of the <lb/>
devil. He also said that Captain Browne was very kind <lb/>
to Mam, and a servant would cost money and eat a great <lb/>
deal, but Jack would "take no money and only eat small <lb/>
potato, small meat." Jack had been privately to a kind <lb/>
friend of his, a non-commissioned officer of cavalry, to <lb/>
get instruction in managing horses. He had profited <lb/>
so well by his lessons that he was found to be really <lb/>
competent to the work, and when a second horse and <lb/>
a cow were added to the establishment he gave his friends <lb/>
no rest till he had received permission to try if he could <lb/>
manage all three, and very proud he became of his <reg orig="po-|sition">position</reg>. <lb/>
In this constant and congenial occupation he <lb/>
grew into a fine and vigorous youth, his mind wholly <lb/>
uncontaminated by evil associations. Besides this work <lb/>
he took much interest in using his pencil, and some of <lb/>
<pb n="352" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0369"/>
his drawings were beautifully done. Another baby had <lb/>
been added to the family and the "beautiful baby boy" <lb/>
seemed to fill Jack's heart, and he often poured out his <lb/>
unspoken prayers for him. He had sweet thoughts about <lb/>
little children. He said that when a baby was learning to <lb/>
walk Jesus took hold of its hand and guided it, and that <lb/>
when it fell He placed His hand between its head and <lb/>
the floor to save it from being hurt.</p>
<p>To Charlotte Elizabeth the full life at the cottage was <lb/>
most restful. From her own window she had a view of <lb/>
the college, and every day, "when she saw the <reg orig="prepara-|tory">preparatory</reg> <lb/>
movement for breaking up, she rose from her writing, <lb/>
tied on her bonnet, and went off to meet her brother." <lb/>
In the freedom enjoyed after six hours' hard work their <lb/>
naturally high spirits rose till they were like children let <lb/>
loose from school. The afternoon was often passed in <lb/>
gardening, or looking after their little farm, the <reg orig="chil-|dren">children</reg> <lb/>
gambolling about and Jack looking on with great <lb/>
delight. His admiration for "beautiful Captain Browne," <lb/>
as he called him, knew no bounds. At ten the brother <lb/>
and sister separated for the night, Charlotte Elizabeth to <lb/>
write till long after midnight, her brother to rise at four <lb/>
and study for several hours before they met in the <reg orig="morn-|ing">morning</reg>. <lb/>
They visited little; the domestic life, mingling with <lb/>
one another and with the children, who were the delight <lb/>
of his eyes, satisfied them both. But the time of <reg orig="separa-|tion">separation</reg> <lb/>
was at hand. Captain Browne was ordered to <reg orig="Ire-|land">Ireland</reg> <lb/>
for a short time, and then an appointment in England <lb/>
was promised, and the brother and sister looked forward <lb/>
<pb n="353" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0370"/>
to a more permanent residence together. It seemed <lb/>
strange to the latter that this parting, which she hoped <lb/>
was to be so brief, caused her such protracted agony. For <lb/>
three weeks before, and as long after, her brother's <reg orig="depart-|ure">departure</reg> <lb/>
she had not a night's rest. Visions of drowning, <reg orig="espe-|cially">especially</reg> <lb/>
the event enacted in their childhood, were ever before <lb/>
her and she would start up in terror. This was the more <lb/>
remarkable, as both were entirely fearless on the water.</p>
<p>After Captain Browne's departure the reduced family <lb/>
went to live in the village, in a smaller house. There <lb/>
her heart went out to the young cadets, with almost a <lb/>
mother's yearning and agony, touching their temptations. <lb/>
She realized the danger of a Christian boy being unable <lb/>
to withstand the scoffs and jeers which met any <reg orig="indica-|tions">indications</reg> <lb/>
of religious life in the new comers. She often <reg orig="in-|vited">invited</reg> <lb/>
some of the lads to her house, and took walks with <lb/>
them upon the "breezy heath," and it seems probable <lb/>
that the intercourse with one so earnest, and at the same <lb/>
time so cultured and lively, was greatly and permanently <lb/>
blessed to several of them.</p>
<p>One bright summer morning in June, 1828, on waking <lb/>
late, Charlotte Elizabeth found her letters laid by her on <lb/>
the pillow. With eager pleasure she opened the one <lb/>
from the Horse Guards. It was not from her brother's <lb/>
hand. She read the first part, which was meant as a <lb/>
"tender preparation," uncomprehendingly, and then <lb/>
came the fearful stunning blow. At Mullingar her <lb/>
brother, whilst out on the lake fishing, had been <lb/>
drowned. For years she had been fervent in prayer <lb/>
<pb n="354" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0371"/>
for him, and now the first thought that took hold of her <lb/>
mind was the fact that he was beyond the reach of prayer. <lb/>
When she came down, Jack, accustomed to read her face, <lb/>
met her with "a look of wild dismay," anxious to know <lb/>
what had occurred. When she had told him, and had <lb/>
conversed with him a while, his thoughts brought her <lb/>
some comfort. Speaking of Captain Browne, Jack said <lb/>
solemnly: "Jack pray, pray morning, pray night, Jack <lb/>
pray church. Yes, Jack many days very pray." Then, <lb/>
realizing the answer to his prayers and his friend's <reg orig="happi-|ness">happiness</reg>, <lb/>
"with a burst of delighted animation" he told <lb/>
her that Captain Browne was "a very tall angel, very <lb/>
beautiful." That night Charlotte Elizabeth spent in her <lb/>
study, her head resting upon her hands. About two in <lb/>
the morning Jack opened the door, his face deadly pale. <lb/>
She saw him lift up his hands and eyes in prayer, then <lb/>
softly go round the room taking down from the wall <lb/>
every picture containing "a ship, or boat, or water under <lb/>
any form." Then he went out of the room "with a <lb/>
look of such desolate sorrow as by its tender sympathy <lb/>
poured balm into her heart."</p>
<p>Bitter regrets that she had never had intimate religious <lb/>
intercourse with her brother now assailed her.</p>
<p>Before going to Portugal he had not known any earnest <lb/>
Christian, and during the ten years spent in that country <lb/>
he had been much shut out from Christian influences. <lb/>
From all he had heard he had imbibed a strong prejudice <lb/>
against spiritual religion. It was a time of awakening, <lb/>
and the world was opposed to the zeal manifested by many <lb/>
<pb n="355" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0372"/>
of the followers of Christ. Hannah More was cruelly <lb/>
maligned, and when Charlotte Elizabeth persuaded her <lb/>
brother to visit this venerable and accomplished lady at <lb/>
Clifton he was surprised and charmed to find the "Queen <lb/>
of the Methodists" so lively and delightful. He <reg orig="re-|marked">remarked</reg> <lb/>
that if all her followers were like her they must <lb/>
be a very agreeable set of people. He told his sister <lb/>
laughingly that he expected to find them "going down <lb/>
on their knees half a dozen times a day, singing psalms <lb/>
all over the house, and setting themselves against <reg orig="every-|thing">everything</reg> <lb/>
merry and cheerful." She was naturally anxious <lb/>
not to give him any cause for disgust towards religion, <lb/>
and put off till their future settlement together any <reg orig="in-|timate">intimate</reg> <lb/>
conversation on the subject nearest her heart. <lb/>
Now she felt that perhaps he had been longing to talk <lb/>
with her of his soul's interests, and she had been silent! <lb/>
Yet she recalled many indications that he was a Christian. <lb/>
At Sandhurst Captain Browne had delighted in the <reg orig="soci-|ety">society</reg> <lb/>
of truly earnest men, and would never allow from any <lb/>
one a word against the deeply spiritual teaching of the <lb/>
ministry he attended. There were other proofs of his <lb/>
love for Divine things; yet in that terrible hour his sister <lb/>
could not realize that her prayers had been answered, <lb/>
because she had not heard from his own lips the <reg orig="confes-|sion">confession</reg> <lb/>
of his faith. She says she was trammelled, she <lb/>
could not see the blade of grass because it was not <lb/>
already a full ear of corn, and her dumb boy taught <lb/>
her a lesson of trust. Afterwards she had substantial <lb/>
comfort brought to her by letters from Castlebar, from <lb/>
<pb n="356" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0373"/>
the clergyman whose ministry her brother had attended <lb/>
during the last months of his life. She at once adopted <lb/>
his elder boy, now five years old, and in training him <lb/>
found that there was still something worth living for. <lb/>
Jack grieved so, at seeing her grief, that his health gave <lb/>
way, and he fell into a consumption.</p>
<p>In 1829 the proposed Catholic Emancipation Bill <lb/>
roused her, and she strained every nerve to influence <lb/>
those in authority to prevent what seemed to her an <lb/>
impending evil of vast magnitude.</p>
<p>She found ever a solace, in the midst of her varied <lb/>
trials, in work. Her Sabbath class was an immense <reg orig="inter-|est">interest</reg> <lb/>
to her. So popular was her teaching that her cottage <lb/>
parlour could not contain all who came, and she was <lb/>
obliged to divide the company into two parts. She <reg orig="ar-|ranged">arranged</reg> <lb/>
for the thirty girls to come at four o'clock for <lb/>
an hour and a half. A similar number of lads came at <lb/>
six, and it was often difficult to break up the party at <lb/>
eight o'clock, so interesting was the instruction given. <lb/>
Jack sat by in his easy chair. He was getting weaker, <lb/>
but his mind was brighter than ever. He kept watch <lb/>
over the company, and if he saw, which seldom <reg orig="hap-|pened">happened</reg>, <lb/>
the slightest approach to levity, he looked <reg orig="dis-|tressed">distressed</reg> <lb/>
and, holding up his hands as high as he could, <lb/>
spelled "God&mdash;see!"</p>
<p>As time went on, Charlotte Elizabeth's love for <reg orig="Ire-|land">Ireland</reg> <lb/>
deepened, if that were possible.</p>
<p>In 1830, while staying in London with a little nephew <lb/>
who required medical care, she attended the annual <reg orig="meet-|ing">meeting</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="357" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0374"/>
of the Irish Society. During the earlier speeches she <lb/>
was revolving in her mind what she could do to promote <lb/>
the interests of Ireland, when Mr. Seymour, the <reg orig="vener-|able">venerable</reg> <lb/>
clergyman from Castlebar, rose. He put in a strong <lb/>
plea for the poor Irish living in spiritual destitution on <lb/>
English ground, and he fervently entreated that English <lb/>
Christians would open a "Bread shop for the starving <lb/>
souls in St. Giles'!" This appeal touched one heart <lb/>
present, and Charlotte Elizabeth's whole soul was fired <lb/>
with the desire to provide a church for that awfully <lb/>
destitute district. She wrote an appeal which she <reg orig="dis-|tributed">distributed</reg> <lb/>
among a large circle of friends; few sympathized. <lb/>
One day at the table of Dr. Pidduck many were <reg orig="banter-|ing">bantering</reg> <lb/>
her for being sanguine enough to hope to succeed <lb/>
in her design. The doctor said: "You remind me of <lb/>
Columbus, going to the Cathedral of Seville to ask a <lb/>
blessing on his romantic project of discovering a new <lb/>
world. Everybody laughed at him. Nevertheless he <lb/>
succeeded, <hi rend="italic">and so will you.</hi>" At that moment a <reg orig="gentle-|man">gentleman</reg> <lb/>
sitting next to her laid a sovereign on her piece <lb/>
of bread. "The coincidence between the gold and the <lb/>
bread" so cheered her that she exclaimed, "I will <reg orig="suc-|ceed">succeed</reg>." <lb/>
With seven pounds in hand she wrote to the <lb/>
Bishop of Lichfield to ask him to appeal to the Bishop <lb/>
of London to license a church for the Irish. She <reg orig="re-|ceived">received</reg> <lb/>
in reply the message: "The Bishop will license <lb/>
your church. Lichfield sends his love, and desires you <lb/>
to summon the gentlemen who are associated with you, <lb/>
half a dozen or so, to meet him in Sackville St., on <lb/>
<pb n="358" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0375"/>
Saturday next, and be there yourself. He will see what <lb/>
can be done to forward it." Her only helpers were Dr. <lb/>
Pidduck, Lord Mountsandford, and the Hon. Somerset <lb/>
Maxwell; and she exclaims, "Half a dozen gentlemen! <lb/>
where was I to find them?" She worked desperately, <lb/>
and on Saturday went with trembling hope and fear to <lb/>
Sackville St., accompanied by two warm-hearted young <lb/>
Irish barristers. On entering the room what was her <lb/>
joy and surprise to see Bishop Ryder in the chair, <reg orig="sup-|ported">supported</reg> <lb/>
by the Bishop of Bath and Wells, several lords, and <lb/>
about forty other clergymen and gentlemen. When the <lb/>
chairman knelt down and asked a blessing on the work, <lb/>
she thought she "might as well die then as not, she could <lb/>
never die happier." A committee was formed for <reg orig="receiv-|ing">receiving</reg> <lb/>
subscriptions, but the work was not taken out of <lb/>
her hands. At the end of her two months' stay in <reg orig="Lon-|don">London</reg> <lb/>
thirteen hundred pounds had been collected, and <lb/>
she returned to Sandhurst with a heart full of praise. <lb/>
She wrote on a card the words which had been running <lb/>
in her mind all the time, and placed it over her study <lb/>
mantelpiece: <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"Victorious faith the promise sees,</l>
<l rend="indent">And looks to God alone,</l>
<l>Laughs at impossibilities,</l>
<l rend="indent">And says, It shall be done!"</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>In the following November the Irish Episcopal Church <lb/>
was opened in St. Giles. It became the centre of a <lb/>
blessed work, and from time to time new helpers were <lb/>
<pb n="359" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0376"/>
raised up to carry it on. Mr. Donald, a young <reg orig="bar-|rister">barrister</reg>, <lb/>
had long before gathered the little ragged children <lb/>
into a sabbath school in the district, and his heart yearned <lb/>
over these little ones and their parents with intense <reg orig="long-|ings">longings</reg> <lb/>
for their salvation. In the midst of a busy <reg orig="profes-|sional">professional</reg> <lb/>
life his labours among this people were untiring, <lb/>
and, during an epidemic in the district, his life was <lb/>
eventually sacrificed to his devotion to them.</p>
<p>Of course there was opposition, and one poor fellow <lb/>
sealed his faith by a martyr's death.</p>
<p>We must not enter into all that Charlotte Elizabeth <lb/>
went through, from the earnest desire of her acquaintance <lb/>
to lead her into their own peculiar paths of religious <lb/>
profession. Prayer and her Bible were her unfailing <lb/>
weapons in the discussions which went on, and she <lb/>
remained a member of the Church of England, satisfied <lb/>
that unless that Church should herself &lpar;and not merely <lb/>
her individual members&rpar; accept and promulgate <reg orig="ritual-|istic">ritualistic</reg> <lb/>
teaching and practices, it was <hi rend="italic">her</hi> abiding place.</p>
<p>We have not noticed her love for the Jews; it was <lb/>
only second to her love for Ireland, and, as she was <lb/>
enabled, she laboured earnestly to promote their <reg orig="en-|lightenment">enlightenment</reg>. <lb/>
This love for the Jews grew out of those <lb/>
early readings in the Bible when the bright stream of <lb/>
gospel light first illumined her heart and she received <lb/>
its teaching with new interest. Jack also showed a deep <lb/>
interest about the Jews, and it was a singular fact that <lb/>
in his simple way he connected the return of the Jews <lb/>
to their own country, and the overthrow of popery, with <lb/>
<pb n="360" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0377"/>
the personal reign of Christ upon the earth, and this <lb/>
at a time when his teacher did not hold this view but <lb/>
expected the regeneration of the world to take place <lb/>
gradually through the preaching of the gospel. "Poor <lb/>
Jew very soon see Jesus Christ," he would often exclaim.</p>
<p>During the winter of 1830 Jack was failing fast; he <lb/>
was now nineteen, a fine tall young man. The visits <lb/>
of Mr. Donald were amongst his greatest pleasures. <lb/>
Charlotte Elizabeth tells how she loved to watch her <lb/>
noble-minded friend, as with all humility and tenderness <lb/>
he waited upon the sick youth. Jack received his <reg orig="at-|tentions">attentions</reg> <lb/>
with humble gratitude and with that refined <lb/>
courtesy of manner which was habitual to him. On <lb/>
the last morning of his life he seemed stronger and was <lb/>
able to converse a great deal. He prayed for his family, <lb/>
commended his brother and sister to his adopted mother <lb/>
for counsel and teaching, begged her to bring up her <lb/>
brother's boys to love Jesus Christ, and repeated over <lb/>
and over again the fervent injunction "to love poor <lb/>
Ireland, to pray for Ireland, to write books for Jack's <lb/>
poor Ireland, and in every way to oppose Roman." <lb/>
Very sweetly he had thanked her for all her care. Once <lb/>
more he spelled upon his fingers the name so dear to <lb/>
him, "One Jesus Christ &lpar;<hi rend="italic">one</hi> meaning He was the only <lb/>
Saviour&rpar;, Jack's one Jesus Christ!" In the evening his <lb/>
sight failed, an indication of the approaching end which <lb/>
he received with a smile of pleasure. At last he asked <lb/>
to lie down on the sofa, and saying very calmly, "A <lb/>
sleep," he placed his hand in hers, closed his eyes, and <lb/>
<pb n="361" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0378"/>
passed into His presence "who unstops the ears of the deaf, <lb/>
and causes the tongue of the dumb to make melody."</p>
<p>While she gave up her trust with "a glow of adoring <lb/>
thankfulness" that she had been permitted to train a <lb/>
soul for heaven, Charlotte Elizabeth writes: "I sorely <lb/>
missed the sweet companionship of one who for some <lb/>
years had taught me more than I could teach him."</p>
<p>Now her lot was to be cast among strangers. It <lb/>
was a great trial to break up the home and leave the <lb/>
interests of Sandhurst, but she thought it desirable to <lb/>
reside nearer London. She entered upon her new home <lb/>
with some fears lest no sphere of active usefulness should <lb/>
open for her, but almost immediately she found herself <lb/>
in full work. A dreadful famine was going on in the <lb/>
west of Ireland, and when ample funds had been <reg orig="sub-|scribed">subscribed</reg> <lb/>
for the starving people there, she sought help for <lb/>
her suffering poor in St. Giles'. Money was entrusted <lb/>
to her by interested friends and during four months she <lb/>
spent from four to six hours daily in visiting the people <lb/>
in their wretched homes, carefully administering to their <lb/>
needs, but never giving the relief in money, seeking also <lb/>
by every means in her power to win souls. She was <lb/>
assisted by her dear friend, Dr. Pidduck, who for years <lb/>
laboured among these poor people carrying to them <reg orig="heal-|ing">healing</reg> <lb/>
for their bodies and their souls.</p>
<p>Another work into which she entered was the <reg orig="anti-|slavery">antislavery</reg> <lb/>
cause, and none of the large band of workers <reg orig="re-|joiced">rejoiced</reg> <lb/>
more than she did over the success of their labours <lb/>
when the slaves of the West Indies were liberated.</p>
<pb n="362" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0379"/>
<p>In 1834 she undertook the editorship of a periodical, <lb/>
and it must have been about this time that she abridged <lb/>
Foxe's "Book of Martyrs" into two moderate volumes, <lb/>
an occupation most congenial to her.</p>
<p>In 1837 Captain Phelan died, and she became a widow. <lb/>
In that year she revisited Ireland, the place of her <reg orig="spir-|itual">spiritual</reg> <lb/>
birth, the country which contained her brother's <lb/>
grave.</p>
<p>In 1840 the autobiography ends. She had planned to <lb/>
enlarge and continue it further, should her life be spared <lb/>
a few years; but her time became more and more fully <lb/>
occupied with literary and active labours for the good of <lb/>
others, and the opportunity never arrived. She thus <lb/>
closes the "Personal Recollections": "By the help <lb/>
of my God I continue to this day, anxiously desirous <lb/>
to devote my little talent to His service, as He may <lb/>
graciously permit. I have coveted no man's silver and <lb/>
gold, or apparel, but counted it a privilege to labour <lb/>
with my hands and head, for myself and for those most <lb/>
dear to me. Many trials, various and sharp, have been <lb/>
my portion; but they are passed away. &hellip; The <lb/>
Lord has accepted at my hand one offering in the case <lb/>
of the precious dumb boy, received into glory through <lb/>
His rich blessing on my efforts; and He mercifully <lb/>
gives me to see the welfare of two others &lsqb;her nephews&rsqb; <lb/>
committed to me&hellip; He has been a very gracious <lb/>
Master to me; He has dealt very bountifully, and given <lb/>
me now the abundance of domestic peace, with the light <lb/>
of His countenance to gladden my happy home. Yet <lb/>
<pb n="363" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0380"/>
the brightest beam that falls upon it is the anticipation <lb/>
of that burst of glory, when the Lord Jesus shall be <reg orig="re-|vealed">revealed</reg> <lb/>
from heaven, to reign in righteousness over the <lb/>
world that shall soon, very soon, acknowledge Him the <lb/>
universal, eternal King; and the most fervent aspiration <lb/>
my heart desires to utter is the response to His promise <lb/>
of a speedy advent. 'Even so, Lord Jesus; come <reg orig="quick-|ly">quickly</reg>! <lb/>
Amen!'"</p>
<p>It was a surprise to her friends when, in 1841, she <lb/>
consented to become the wife of Mr. Tonna. Others, <lb/>
one a nobleman, had sought her hand. She did not <lb/>
ask counsel of her friends in these matters, but she <lb/>
earnestly asked to know the will of God, and her <reg orig="hus-|band">husband</reg> <lb/>
says "He did not refuse His guidance nor His <lb/>
blessing." Her sister-cousin, still surviving, testifies to <lb/>
the great happiness of this union, and all the love and <lb/>
tenderness needed by her filled up the remainder of her <lb/>
days. The years that followed were very bright and <lb/>
very full of occupation. She took much interest in <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">The Christian Lady's Magazine,</hi> of which she was editor. <lb/>
In this periodical she wrote, from time to time, series <lb/>
of papers for or about the Jews, which were largely read <lb/>
by them. She was especially anxious to interest English <lb/>
Christians about the Jews. She regretted that they were <lb/>
so little understood, and she felt the importance of <reg orig="in-|culcating">inculcating</reg> <lb/>
the greatest forbearance towards them. It was <lb/>
her desire that they should hear the message, "Believe <lb/>
on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved," <reg orig="un-|encumbered">unencumbered</reg> <lb/>
by conditions such as she believed were <lb/>
<pb n="364" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0381"/>
often imposed on them, and which were very hard for <lb/>
an Israelite to accept.</p>
<p>About this time she wrote "Judah's Lion," which was <lb/>
published month by month in her own magazine. This <lb/>
was her last work of fiction. Although she knew that <lb/>
her previous works in the direction of stories of a <reg orig="re-|ligious">religious</reg> <lb/>
character had been blessed, the conviction became <lb/>
rooted in her mind that these stories were not quite <lb/>
compatible with Christian truthfulness. "To describe the <lb/>
operations of God the Holy Spirit, and the mighty work <lb/>
of regeneration, as taking place in beings who existed <lb/>
only in her own imagination,&mdash;to delineate struggles of <lb/>
conscience which had never taken place,&mdash;and, above all, <lb/>
to indite prayers which had never been uttered, and <reg orig="re-|veal">reveal</reg> <lb/>
their answers&mdash;seemed to her <hi rend="italic">now</hi> something like <lb/>
profanation."</p>
<p>Naturally it could not be a light thing to give up an <lb/>
occupation which was to her such a pleasant recreation, <lb/>
but her Father's will was dearer to her than anything <lb/>
beside. Mr. Tonna describes her interest in the <reg orig="charac-|ters">characters</reg> <lb/>
of her stories. Being shut out from all sound, her <lb/>
capacity for withdrawing into a world of her own was <lb/>
great, and this intensified her glowing powers of <reg orig="imagi-|nation">imagination</reg>. <lb/>
While writing this her last tale, on a certain <lb/>
day in the month she would remind her husband that <lb/>
it was the day for "Judah's Lion," and when he <reg orig="re-|turned">returned</reg> <lb/>
from town in the evening "she recounted to him <lb/>
the events that had happened to Da Costa, and Aleck <lb/>
Cohen, and others with as much eagerness and vivacity <lb/>
<pb n="365" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0382"/>
as though they had been actual occurrences of the day." <lb/>
Her characters were of course all delineated to teach some <lb/>
lesson worthy to be studied.</p>
<p>So clear were her thoughts, and so great was her facility <lb/>
in writing, that she was not accustomed to read over her <lb/>
manuscripts before sending them to the press. On this <lb/>
account, when reading the proofs of a story &lpar;she generally <lb/>
wrote a story without any previous plan&rpar; its incidents <lb/>
seemed so new that she has been known to shed tears <lb/>
when reading it. She generally spent the greater part <lb/>
of the day in writing. Immediately after breakfast she <lb/>
went to her study, locking the door to prevent <reg orig="interrup-|tion">interruption</reg>; <lb/>
her two dogs and a splendid cockatoo rather helping <lb/>
her by their presence. She loved animals, looking upon <lb/>
them in the spirit of the poet, "My Father made them <lb/>
all." It pained her acutely to see them suffer in any <lb/>
way, and all her numerous pets led lives of much <reg orig="enjoy-|ment">enjoyment</reg> <lb/>
under her care. When she was tired of writing, or <lb/>
was seeking an idea, she would work hard in her garden <lb/>
for half an hour and then return to her desk with new <lb/>
thoughts welling up in her mind. The brilliant tints of <lb/>
flowers and gems had upon her the same effect as music <lb/>
upon some minds. She kept in her desk a diamond <lb/>
ring which she wore when writing, "the flashing of the <lb/>
brilliants, as the light fell upon them, greatly helping <lb/>
the flow of thought and imagination." At such times <lb/>
her face would suddenly light up, and when her husband <lb/>
turned an inquiring glance towards her, she would smile <lb/>
and say, "Oh it is only the diamonds!" Her quickness <lb/>
<pb n="366" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0383"/>
of apprehending signs enabled him to converse with her <lb/>
very rapidly; and upon his fingers he could communicate <lb/>
to her sermons, and speeches, and conversations almost <lb/>
without the omission of a word.</p>
<p>After a day of close occupation it was her custom in <lb/>
the summer time to take a walk of ten or twelve miles <lb/>
in the evening. Thus pleasantly passed the life at <reg orig="Black-|heath">Black-heath</reg>, <lb/>
then so far from the smoke of the city; but in this <lb/>
peaceful home she was not unmindful of the interests <lb/>
of the great world outside. During 1842 and 1843, <lb/>
among other papers and works, she wrote "The Wrongs <lb/>
of Women," and a plea for the labouring classes, whom <lb/>
she considered to be at that time under grinding <reg orig="oppres-|sion">oppression</reg>. <lb/>
For the latter work she was largely supplied with <lb/>
information from parliamentary documents and private <lb/>
correspondence of many who were devoting themselves <lb/>
to this inquiry. For two months she digested the facts, <lb/>
and then wrote the volume with her usual ease. The <lb/>
work quickly reached the third edition, and from the <lb/>
highest places in the land inquiries arose as to its <reg orig="author-|ship">authorship</reg>; <lb/>
but so well was the secret kept that no one dreamed <lb/>
that it was from the pen of a woman. This book, "The <lb/>
Perils of the Nation," had large influence.</p>
<p>In 1842 an event occurred which filled her with great <lb/>
joy and astonishment. This was the occupation of the <lb/>
new bishopric at Jerusalem by a Jew. Mr. Alexander, <lb/>
the first Bishop of Jerusalem, became a Christian at <reg orig="Nor-|wich">Norwich</reg>; <lb/>
he had been her intimate friend during sixteen <lb/>
years. At the time she looked upon this event as the <lb/>
<pb n="367" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0384"/>
prelude to the return of the Jews to Palestine, but her <lb/>
views on this subject became afterwards modified.</p>
<p>In 1844 the Emperor Nicholas visited England, and <lb/>
she was anxious to lay before him the needs of his <reg orig="op-|pressed">oppressed</reg> <lb/>
Jewish subjects. She was told that his visit was <lb/>
strictly private and that nothing could be done. She <lb/>
was not to be so easily daunted. Two days of the <reg orig="Em-|peror's">Emperor's</reg> <lb/>
visit remained. She wrote an appeal, which was <lb/>
carefully copied on vellum during the night. Then she <lb/>
hired a carriage and took round the memorial, and <reg orig="ob-|tained">obtained</reg> <lb/>
the signatures of bishops, peers, privy councillors, <lb/>
etc., all being the names of Christian men. The <reg orig="me-|morial">memorial</reg> <lb/>
was presented, and on the Emperor's return to <lb/>
Russia a kind and courteous reply was sent through the <lb/>
ambassador. This was her last public act of kindness <lb/>
requiring active exertion, for disease had insidiously laid <lb/>
hold upon her. It had given indications of its character, <lb/>
but it was not until the end of 1844 that its mortal <reg orig="na-|ture">nature</reg> <lb/>
was definitely ascertained. In <hi rend="italic">The Christian Lady's <lb/>
Magazine</hi> she mentions that for twelve months cancer had <lb/>
been eating away her strength, "rendering that a most <lb/>
laborious toil which before was a delightful recreation." <lb/>
Then, turning to her numerous Jewish readers, she adds: <lb/>
"The Lord &lpar;blessed for ever be the name of the Lord!&rpar; <lb/>
has most mercifully planted this silver arrow in the left <lb/>
side; the right is free; the right hand forgets not her <lb/>
cunning; Jerusalem is not forgotten."</p>
<p>It was indeed a great alleviation of the trial that, <reg orig="ex-|cept">except</reg> <lb/>
during the last two months of her life, she was able <lb/>
<pb n="368" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0385"/>
to use the pen, for her thoughts continued to flow with <lb/>
such rapidity that dictation was almost impracticable. <lb/>
When her left hand became useless she invented a <reg orig="ma-|chine">machine</reg> <lb/>
during one of her sleepless nights to facilitate <lb/>
writing. It consisted of two rollers on a frame. On <lb/>
the lower one were many yards of paper, rolled, and <lb/>
as fast as she filled a page, by turning a small winch it <lb/>
was wound on to the upper roller and a clean surface <lb/>
displayed. In this way she wrote papers for the press, <lb/>
and letters, measuring several yards in length. About <lb/>
this time "Jud&aelig;a Capta" was written.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1845 Mrs. Tonna moved to the <lb/>
official residence of her husband, that she might have <lb/>
him constantly near to her. In this more central home <lb/>
she had larger intercourse with intimate friends, and the <lb/>
Christian communion with some beloved fellow-workers <lb/>
of other days was very refreshing to her. Visiting <reg orig="Rams-|gate">Ramsgate</reg> <lb/>
for the benefit of sea air, she had the great pleasure <lb/>
of becoming acquainted with Sir Moses and Lady <reg orig="Monte-|fiore">Montefiore</reg>. <lb/>
She visited them at their noble residence on the <lb/>
East Cliff, and as Sir Moses pointed his hand over the <lb/>
sea and said, "There is Jerusalem," she and her host <lb/>
"vied with each other in repeating from the prophet <lb/>
Isaiah the glorious promises of Israel's future."</p>
<p>During her illness it was enough to speak to her of <lb/>
"the Lord's speedy coming, of the future glory of Zion, <lb/>
or any kindred theme," and her sufferings were forgotten, <lb/>
and "with a glow of delight upon her face she would <lb/>
express the stirring thoughts which filled her," few <reg orig="im-|agining">imagining</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="369" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0386"/>
that each movement cost her severe pain. With <lb/>
her accustomed faith in God she accepted her illness as <lb/>
exactly the discipline she needed, and praised Him for <lb/>
His love in selecting for her a dispensation of bodily pain <lb/>
to which she had been unaccustomed. Her husband says <lb/>
that "kindness, and love, and sympathy flowed in on <lb/>
every side." Her unknown as well as her long-loved <lb/>
friends, who sent her words of cheer or refreshing gifts <lb/>
of fruit and other things, were all remembered by her <lb/>
in prayer that spiritual blessings might be poured out <lb/>
upon them by Him to whom they had ministered "in <lb/>
the person of His unworthy servant."</p>
<p>For her Jewish sisters, who loved her "because she <lb/>
loved their nation," she prayed that they might "find, <lb/>
and know, and love that Redeemer whom they were <reg orig="un-|consciously">unconsciously</reg> <lb/>
visiting in His poor afflicted disciple." One <lb/>
passage in her life at this time we cannot pass by; it <lb/>
shows so unmistakably the depth and reality of a religion <lb/>
which enabled her to humble herself to make public <reg orig="con-|fession">confession</reg> <lb/>
of error.</p>
<p>The prospect of the first public meeting in connection <lb/>
with the Evangelical Alliance stirred her heart, and <reg orig="be-|lieving">believing</reg> <lb/>
that where a number of Christians of various <reg orig="de-|nominations">denominations</reg> <lb/>
were gathered together in harmony, with one <lb/>
high and holy aim, <hi rend="italic">there</hi> must descend a special blessing, <lb/>
she asked for strength to be present. The strength was <lb/>
given, and she sat through a meeting of five hours' <reg orig="dura-|tion">duration</reg>, <lb/>
entering into the speeches with her wonted vivid <lb/>
interest. She wrote an account of the proceedings in <lb/>
<pb n="370" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0387"/>
<hi rend="italic">The Christian Lady's Magazine.</hi> "Many reasons <reg orig="com-|bined">combined</reg> <lb/>
to make the speech of the Hon. and Rev. Baptist <lb/>
Noel particularly touching to her." She thus refers to <lb/>
his address: "Mr. Noel was peculiarly energetic; he <lb/>
grappled with hostile arguments, and prepared his <reg orig="breth-|ren">brethren</reg> <lb/>
for the extreme of opposition that Satan could rouse <lb/>
against a work so eminently accordant with the very life <lb/>
and soul of the gospel. He alluded to the resistance that <lb/>
he personally had encountered, and was daily <reg orig="encounter-|ing">encountering</reg>, <lb/>
in the active prosecution of the work; and he spoke <lb/>
as one ready to bear and do all things through the <lb/>
strengthening power of Christ." She continues: "The <lb/>
readers of the magazine may easily comprehend how, in <lb/>
that hour of sacred fellowship, its Editor's heart smote <lb/>
her, <hi rend="italic">not</hi> for having, on various points connected with <lb/>
Ireland and political matters, differed from Mr. Noel; <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">not</hi> for having openly protested against opinions in which <lb/>
she did not and does not now concur; but for having <lb/>
expressed that dissent in language of petulance, asperity, <lb/>
and uncharitableness, for which the only excuse to be <lb/>
made is an unconditional acknowledgment of error, an <lb/>
unreserved request for pardon at our brother's hand.</p>
<p>"We have since that blessed meeting said this and <lb/>
more by letter to himself, and received a most ready <lb/>
Christian response. We now publicly repeat the <reg orig="retracta-|tion">retractation</reg> <lb/>
of every harsh, every unsisterly word; and we pray <lb/>
that all may be obliterated from the minds of those who <lb/>
still remember it."</p>
<p>To those who visited her it was evident that her time <lb/>
<pb n="371" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0388"/>
on earth was growing short, though she herself believed <lb/>
that the disease had run its course, and that she might <lb/>
yet live on and labour for some years; and in this view <lb/>
her husband concurred.</p>
<p>She had a very humble estimate of herself, and when <lb/>
any friends alluded to the result of her labours as a proof <lb/>
of her acceptance with God, she was much distressed, <reg orig="say-|ing">saying</reg>, <lb/>
"I might be but the finger-post that points the road, <lb/>
but moves not on."</p>
<p>One season of conflict was permitted her, the comfort <lb/>
which had so largely upheld her was no longer realized. <lb/>
The sin of irritability, no doubt induced by the worn out <lb/>
state of the nerves, "was mourned over with tears and <lb/>
anguish, but it seemed to her so utterly incompatible with <lb/>
her being a child of God that she began to doubt whether <lb/>
it were possible that she belonged to Him. She did not <lb/>
doubt the sufficiency of the Saviour, but simply whether, <lb/>
if He had indeed called her, it were possible she should <lb/>
show so little conformity to His will." Nothing brought <lb/>
her comfort till one day her husband said to her, "<reg orig="With-|out">Without</reg> <lb/>
attempting to contradict what you say, if you have <lb/>
not come to Jesus, come to Him <hi rend="italic">now!</hi>" He then read <lb/>
to her from the Bible the simplest promises and <reg orig="invita-|tions">invitations</reg>. <lb/>
She remained silent for some time, and then <lb/>
prayed, as she expressed it, her favourite hymn, <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"Rock of ages, cleft for me,"</l>
</lg></q>
especially dwelling on the line, <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"Cleanse me from its guilt and power."</l>
</lg></q></p>
<pb n="372" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0389"/>
<p>"From that time, with little interruption, her heart and <lb/>
lips were full of praise to God for His goodness to her."</p>
<p>She was longing for sea air, and on the 10th of July <lb/>
was removed to Ramsgate. She had desired that the six <lb/>
sergeants attached to the United Service Institution should <lb/>
carry her pall in case she died in London. Now they <lb/>
bore her, in a very prostrate condition to the carriage. <lb/>
On parting she thanked them for all their kindness and <lb/>
attentions during her illness, and, shaking hands with <lb/>
each, asked the Lord to bless them.</p>
<p>Sir Moses Montefiore came to the terminus to take <lb/>
leave of her, bringing a basket of choice grapes for the <lb/>
journey. When the carriage door was closed she <reg orig="de-|sired">desired</reg> <lb/>
her husband and her faithful servant, Mary Nelms, <lb/>
to kneel down and ask the Lord to uphold her during <lb/>
the journey. This prayer was mercifully answered. <reg orig="Pass-|ing">Passing</reg> <lb/>
through Canterbury, her attention was directed to <lb/>
the splendid cathedral. She said, "Yes, it is very grand; <lb/>
but there is where the martyrs were starved to death!" <lb/>
pointing to the towers of an ancient gateway. On the <lb/>
next day she was much worse, but during the night she <lb/>
was "cheerful, even to playfulness." On the morning <lb/>
of the 12th there was a great change, and life seemed <lb/>
ebbing fast, while her face retained its calm and happy <lb/>
expression. Once her eyes brightened, and throwing her <lb/>
arm round her husband, who was leaning over her, she <lb/>
exclaimed, with emphasis, "I love you!" Those <reg orig="pres-|ent">present</reg> <lb/>
thought that these were her last words, but she had <lb/>
still a message for some dear Jewish friends. Raising <lb/>
<pb n="373" entity="Darton_HeroismOfModernReligion_0390"/>
herself with tremendous effort, and panting for breath <lb/>
between each word, she said with loud, clear voice, <lb/>
"Tell them that Jesus is the Messiah; and tell<gap desc="long dash" reason="missing" id="g12"/>"</p>
<p>Mrs. Tonna writes: "her hand had forgotten its <reg orig="cun-|ning">cunning</reg>, <lb/>
her tongue was cleaving to the roof of her mouth, <lb/>
but Charlotte Elizabeth had not forgotten Jerusalem."</p>
<p>The breathings grew fainter, and at twenty minutes <lb/>
past two she entered into her eternal rest.</p>
<p>She was buried in Ramsgate Churchyard in presence <lb/>
of a very large concourse of people, her beloved friend, <lb/>
Mr. Dibden, the pastor of her Irish church, officiating <lb/>
on the solemn occasion.</p>
<p>At her request her husband planted on her grave some <lb/>
shamrocks which she had brought from the banks of the <lb/>
Lake of Mullingar; and upon the simple headstone which <lb/>
marks her resting place he inscribed the epitaph she had <lb/>
herself written, the date only being added: <lb/>
<q><hi rend="small-caps">Here lie the mortal remains of</hi> <lb/>
<hi rend="gothic">Charlotte Elizabeth,</hi> <lb/>
