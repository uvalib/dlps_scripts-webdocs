            Dear Paul:
            </salute></opener>
        		
        		<p>
            One of the
            ladies in this town is
            leaving for Paris with a 
            lot of refugees and I
            am sending this down
            by her to be mailed 
            from there.  Nearly all
            the civils are gone now
            which is most sensible.
            The bombardments are so
            bad of late that the
            hospitals have been closed
            and now we have to
            evacuate all the way 
            to Dieulouard.  Following an
            attack the work is very
            hard for we have to creep
            at night along a road
            jammed with artillery
            caissons, and supply trains.
            
            <pb n="[p.2]"/>
            
            I was an actor in the
            show that resulted in
            the closing of the largest
            ambulance.  I’d just
            run into the court yard,
            and a doctor had come up
            to me as I was getting ready
            to leave, when we heard
            a marmite that was going
            to hit close to us.  She
            banged down a hundred 
            yards from us and removed
            the second story of a house,
            killing a few people.  We
            crouched to avoid the
            eclats.  The doctor said
            “Come inside” I followed
            him into the corridor
            that runs the length of
            the front of the hospital.
            
            <pb n="[p.3]"/>
            
            No sooner had we entered
            than I saw two men
            that were standing near the
            next arch entrance to the
            one we had passed into
            the corridor by, crouch
            swiftly against the wall
            inside.  I don’t know exactly
            whether I heard the whistle
            or not but I do know
            that suddenly the air
            turned into a crushing
            solid that took my
            breath away.  There was
            a terrific detonation and
            it became dark.  Glass,
            pebbles, dirt and plaster
            pelted me from all
            directions and I wondered
            what was coming next.
            I expected the wall.  Then
            
            <pb n="[p.4]"/>
            
            I heard shrieks above the 
            din of falling debris
            and thru [sic] the clouds of
            smoke and dust a man
            tottered towards me,
            yelling and crying like
            hell.  He grabbed my
            shoulders and sobbed
            like a little child that
            a dog has scared.  He
            hadn’t been hit.  It was
            the unnerving effect those
            big shells have.  When 
            it cleared up I saw
            nothing but wreck and 
            ruin around me.  Two of
            our group were down.
            One was lying very still
            and a stream of blood
            flowed from him and
            eat its way thru [sic] the
            
            <pb n="[p.5]"/>
            
            thick layer of dust on
            the floor.  An eclat had
            gone right thru [sic] him.
            The other died afterwards.
            Some others were wounded.
            I wasn’t touched.  The
            210 had exploded 25
            yards from us.  Fortunately
            it hit in the court
            yard just before reaching
            the wall we were
            behind, otherwise I wouldn’t
            be here.  Of course you’ve
            seen a lot of em [sic] in the
            trenches but it gets
            you nervous to have
            the blooming things
            roar on in when one’s
            above ground.  69 came
            in after that.  There
            were about 50 casualties.
        		</p><p>
        			
            <pb n="[p.6]"/>
            
            Did I write you about
            the pleasant voyage I
            had to the Gros Chene
            where they bury the dead,
            and about fishing two
            Boches out between the
            first and second line
            trenches?
            </p><p>
            I was up in
            the first line at the 
            Col de Cygne where some of
            the most terrific fighting
            of the war has been
            going on.  By the way a 
            bunch of those Greeks
            from the 1st Etranger
            sneaked over to the 
            Boche line the other
            night carrying only
            knives and they cut 
            up quite a bunch of
            Germans before going back.
            
            <pb n="[p.7]"/>
            
            When do you reckon,
            if you are doing any
            figuring, the big 
            affair is coming off?
            I was talking with
            Salisbury about chances 
            of getting down to
            it and I think I can
            get off for a day if no 
            big attack is staged at 
            the same time.  I’d have
            to know about 2 weeks
            ahead tho [sic] in order to
            get my papers and a
            letter from you full of 
            important names would 
            help considerably.
            </p><p>
            Do I understand that
            you’re going to get K
            
            <pb n="[p.8]"/>
            
            transfered [sic] to Paris
            in the near future.[?]
            </p><p>
            Wonderful weather out
            here now and things
            are moving well.  The 
            last attack gave us
            command of the Norroy
            road and we can shell
            hell out of the German
            supplies.  The last bunch
            of prisoners look seedier
            than ever.  One told me
            he thought the gig was
            up and that Germany
            couldn’t hold out much
            longer.  Personne ne sait
            Mon Ami.
