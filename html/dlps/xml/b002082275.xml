<head><hi rend="bold">INTRODUCTION</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> Book of Heroes should never be separated from <lb/>
the Book of Heroines; they are the two parts of that <lb/>
story of courage, service and achievement which is the <lb/>
most interesting and inspiring chapter in the history of <lb/>
human kind in this wonderful world of ours. <reg orig="When-|ever">Whenever</reg> <lb/>
and wherever there has appeared a hero, a heroine <lb/>
has almost always worked with or for him; for heroic and <lb/>
noble deeds are rarely done without some kind of <reg orig="co&ouml;per-|ation">co&ouml;peration</reg>. <lb/>
Now and then, it is true, single acts of daring <lb/>
stand out alone; but, as a rule, the hero gains his end <lb/>
because other men or women stand beside him in times <lb/>
of great peril. William the Silent could not have made <lb/>
his heroic defence of the Low Countries against the <lb/>
armies of Spain if men of heroic temper and women of <lb/>
indomitable courage had not been about him in those <lb/>
terrible years; Washington could not have converted a <lb/>
body of farmers into an organized and disciplined army <lb/>
if he had not been aided by the skill of drill masters like <lb/>
Steuben; nor could Lieutenant Peary make brilliant <lb/>
dashes for the North Pole if other men did not join him <lb/>
in his perilous expeditions. The hero is generally a <lb/>
leader of heroes, as a great general is a leader of soldiers <lb/>
who carry out his plans in hourly jeopardy of limb and <lb/>
life.</p>
<p>It is a mistake to think of heroes as rare and exceptional <lb/>
men; the world is full of those who take their lives in <lb/>
<pb n="viii" entity="b002082275_0019"/>
their hands every day and think nothing about it; or, if <lb/>
they think of it at all, think of it, as Mr. Kipling would <lb/>
say, as part of the day's work. It is almost impossible <lb/>
to open a daily newspaper without coming upon some <lb/>
story of daring by some obscure man or woman. The <lb/>
record of a fire department is usually a continuous <reg orig="regis-|ter">register</reg> <lb/>
of the brave deeds done by those who receive very <lb/>
small pay for a very dangerous service to their fellows. <lb/>
It is not necessary to go back to the days of chivalry or <lb/>
to open the histories of great wars to find a hero; he <lb/>
lives in every street, works in every profession and <lb/>
never thinks that he is doing anything unusual or <reg orig="im-|pressive">impressive</reg>. <lb/>
There are many stories of heroic deeds and <lb/>
men, but these are as nothing compared with the <reg orig="un-|written">unwritten</reg> <lb/>
stories of brave and chivalrous people whose <lb/>
lives are full of courage, self-denial and sacrifice, but of <lb/>
whom no public reports are ever made.</p>
<p>It has taken three centuries to explore and settle this <lb/>
country, and there are still parts of it in which those who <lb/>
live face the perils and hardships of pioneers. Ever <lb/>
since the war of the Revolution the skirmish line of <lb/>
civilisation has moved steadily forward from the Atlantic <lb/>
to the Pacific; and every man who has carried a rifle or <lb/>
an axe, who has defended his home against Indians or <lb/>
cut down trees, made a clearing, built a rude house <lb/>
and turned the prairie or the land taken from the forest <lb/>
into a farm, has had something of the hero in him. He <lb/>
has often been selfish, harsh and unjust; but he has <lb/>
been daring, full of endurance and with a capacity for <lb/>
heroic work; But he has never been alone; we see him <lb/>
always as he faces his foes or bears the strain of his <lb/>
work: we often forget that there was as much courage <lb/>
in the log house as on the firing line at the edge of the <lb/>
<pb n="ix" entity="b002082275_0020"/>
forest, and that the work indoors was harder in many <lb/>
ways than the work out of doors and far less varied and <lb/>
inspiriting. If we could get at the facts we should find <lb/>
that there have been more heroines than heroes in the <lb/>
long warfare of the race against foes within and without, <lb/>
and that the courage of women has had far less to <reg orig="stim-|ulate">stimulate</reg> <lb/>
it in dramatic or picturesque conditions or crises. <lb/>
It is much easier to make a perilous charge in full <reg orig="day-|light">daylight</reg>, <lb/>
with flying banners and the music of bugles <reg orig="ring-|ing">ringing</reg> <lb/>
across the field, than to hold a lonely post, in solitude <lb/>
at midnight, against a stealthy and unseen enemy.</p>
<p>Boys do not need to be taught to admire the bold <lb/>
rush on the enemies' position, the brilliant and audacious <lb/>
passage through the narrow channel under the guns of <lb/>
masked batteries, the lonely march into Central Africa, <lb/>
the dash to the North Pole; they do need to be taught <lb/>
the heroism of those who give the hero his sword and <lb/>
then go home to wait for his return; who leave the <lb/>
stockade unarmed and, under a fire of poisoned arrows, <lb/>
run to the springs for water for a thirsting garrison; <lb/>
who quietly stay at their posts and as quietly die without <lb/>
the inspiration of dramatic achievement or of the <reg orig="heart-|felt">heartfelt</reg> <lb/>
applause of spectators; who bear heavy burdens <lb/>
without a chance to drop or change them; who are <lb/>
heroically patient under blighting disappointments and <lb/>
are loyal to those who are disloyal to them; who bear <lb/>
terrible wrongs in silence, and conceal the cowardice of <lb/>
those they love and cover their retreat with a smiling <lb/>
courage which is the very soul of the pathos of unavailing <lb/>
heroism and undeserved failure.</p>
<p>From the days of Esther, Judith and Antigone to <lb/>
those of Florence Nightingale, women have shown every <lb/>
kind of courage that men have shown, faced every kind <lb/>
<pb n="x" entity="b002082275_0021"/>
of peril that men have braved, divided with men the <lb/>
dangers and hardships of heroism but have never had an <lb/>
equal share of recognition and applause. So far as they <lb/>
are concerned this lack of equal public reward has been <lb/>
of small consequence; the best of them have not only not <lb/>
cared for it, but have shunned it. It is well to remember <lb/>
that the noblest heroes have never sought applause; <lb/>
and that popularity is much more dangerous to heroes <lb/>
than the foes they faced or the savage conditions they <lb/>
mastered in the splendid hour of daring achievement. <lb/>
Many heroes have been betrayed by popularity into <lb/>
vanity and folly and have lost at home the glory they <lb/>
won abroad. Heroic women have not cared for public <lb/>
recognition and do not need it; but it is of immense <lb/>
importance to society that the ideals of heroism should <lb/>
be high and true, and that the soldier and the explorer <lb/>
should not be placed above those whose achievements <lb/>
have been less dramatic, but of a finer quality. The <lb/>
women who have shown heroic courage, heroic patience, <lb/>
heroic purity and heroic devotion outrank the men whose <lb/>
deeds have had their inspiration in physical bravery, <lb/>
who have led splendid charges in full view of the world, <lb/>
who have achieved miracles of material construction in <lb/>
canal or railroad, or the reclaiming of barbarous lands to <lb/>
the uses of civilization. In a true scale of heroic living <lb/>
and doing women must be counted more heroic than <lb/>
men.</p>
<p>A writer of varied and brilliant talent and of a generous <lb/>
and gallant spirit was asked at a dinner table, one <reg orig="even-|ing">evening</reg> <lb/>
not many years ago, why no women appeared in his <lb/>
stories. He promptly replied that he admired pluck <lb/>
above all other qualities, that he was timid by nature <lb/>
and had won courage at the point of danger, and cared <lb/>
<pb n="xi" entity="b002082275_0022"/>
for &iacute;t as the most splendid of manly qualities. There <lb/>
happened to be a woman present who bore the name <lb/>
of one of the most daring men of the time, and who <lb/>
knew army life intimately. She made no comment and <lb/>
offered no objection to the implication of the eminent <lb/>
writer's incautious statement; but presently she began, <lb/>
in a very quiet tone, to describe the incidents of her <lb/>
experience in army posts and on the march, and every <lb/>
body listened intently as she went on narrating story <lb/>
after story of the pluck and indifference to danger of <lb/>
women on the frontier posts and, in some instances, on <lb/>
the march. The eminent writer remained silent, but <lb/>
the moment the woman withdrew from the table he was <lb/>
eager to know who the teller of these stories of heroism <lb/>
was and how she had happened upon such remarkable <lb/>
experiences; and it was noted that a woman appeared in <lb/>
his next novel!</p>
<p>The stories in this volume have been collected from <lb/>
many sources in the endeavour to illustrate the wide <lb/>
range of heroism in the lives of brave and noble women, <lb/>
and with the hope that these records of splendid or quiet <lb/>
courage will open the eyes of young readers to the many <lb/>
forms which heroism wears, and furnish a more spiritual <lb/>
scale of heroic qualities.</p>

ALCESTIS</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Asclepius,</hi> the son of Apollo, being a mighty <lb/>
physician, raised men from the dead. But <lb/>
Zeus was wroth that a man should have such power, <lb/>
and so make of no effect the ordinance of the gods. <lb/>
Wherefore he smote Asclepius with a thunderbolt and <lb/>
slew him. And when Apollo knew this, he slew the <lb/>
Cyclop&eacute;s that had made the thunderbolts for his father <lb/>
Zeus, for men say that they make them on their forges <lb/>
that are in the mountain of Etna.</p>
<p>Zeus suffered not this deed to go unpunished, but <lb/>
passed this sentence on his son Apollo, that he should <lb/>
serve a mortal man for the space of a whole year. <reg orig="Where-|fore">Wherefore</reg>, <lb/>
for all that he was a god, he kept the sheep of <lb/>
Admetus, who was the Prince of Pher&aelig; in Thessaly. <lb/>
And Admetus knew not that he was a god; but, <reg orig="never-|theless">nevertheless</reg>, <lb/>
being a just man, dealt truly with him.</p>
<p>And it came to pass after this that Admetus was sick <lb/>
unto death. But Apollo gained this grace for him of <lb/>
the Fates &lpar;who order of life and death for men&rpar;, that he <lb/>
should live, if only he could find some one who should <lb/>
be willing to die in his stead. And he went to all his <lb/>
<pb n="4" entity="b002082275_0029"/>
kinsmen and friends and asked this thing of them, but <lb/>
found no one that was willing so to die; only Alcestis his <lb/>
wife was willing.</p>
<p>And when the day was come on the which it was <lb/>
appointed for her to die, Death came that he might <lb/>
fetch her. And when he was come, he found Apollo <lb/>
walking to and for before the palace of King Admetus, <lb/>
having his bow in his hand. And when Death saw him, <lb/>
he said:</p>
<p>"What doest thou here, Apollo? Is it not enough <lb/>
for thee to have kept Admetus from his doom? Dost <lb/>
thou keep watch and ward over this woman with thine <lb/>
arrows and they bow?"</p>
<p>"Fear not," the god made answer, "I have justice <lb/>
on my side."</p>
<p>"If thou hast justice, what need of thy bow?"</p>
<p>"'T is my wont to carry it."</p>
<p>"Ay, and it is thy wont to help this house beyond all <lb/>
right and law."</p>
<p>"Nay, but I was troubled at the sorrows of one that <lb/>
I loved, and helped him."</p>
<p>"I know thy cunning speech and fair ways; but this <lb/>
woman thou shalt not take from me."</p>
<p>"But consider; thou canst have but one life. Wilt <lb/>
thou not take another in her stead?"</p>
<p>"Her and no other will I have, for my honour is <lb/>
the greater when I take the young."</p>
<p>"I know thy temper, hated both of gods and of men. <lb/>
But there cometh a guest to this house, whom <reg orig="Eurys-|theus">Eurystheus</reg> <lb/>
sendeth to the snowy plains of Thrace, to fetch <lb/>
the horses of Diomed. Haply he shall persuade thee <lb/>
against thy will."</p>
<p>"Say what thou wilt; it shall avail nothing. And now <lb/>
<pb n="5" entity="b002082275_0030"/>
I go to cut off a lock of her hair, for I take these <reg orig="first-|fruits">first-fruits</reg> <lb/>
of them that die."</p>
<p>In the meantime, within the palace, Alcestis prepared <lb/>
herself for death. And first she washed her body with <lb/>
pure water from the river, and then she took from her <lb/>
coffer of cedar her fairest apparel, and adorned herself <lb/>
therewith. Then, being so arranged, she stood before <lb/>
the hearth and prayed, saying:</p>
<p>"O Queen Her&eacute;, behold! I depart this day. Do <lb/>
thou therefore keep my children, giving to this one a <lb/>
noble husband and to that a loving wife."</p>
<p>And all the altars that were in the house she visited <lb/>
in like manner, crowning them with myrtle leaves and <lb/>
praying at them. Nor did she weep at all, or groan, or <lb/>
grow pale. But at the last, when she came to her <lb/>
chamber, she cast herself upon the bed and kissed it, <lb/>
crying:</p>
<p>"I hate thee not, though I die for thee, giving myself <lb/>
for my husband. And thee another wife shall possess, <lb/>
not more true than I am, but, maybe, more fortunate!"</p>
<p>And after she had left the chamber, she turned to it <lb/>
again and again with many tears.</p>
<p>And all the while her children clung to her garments, <lb/>
and she took them up in her arms, the one first and then <lb/>
the other, and kissed them. And all the servants that <lb/>
were in the house bewailed their mistress, nor did she <lb/>
fail to reach her hand to each of them greeting him. <lb/>
There was not one of them so vile but she spake to him <lb/>
and was spoken to again.</p>
<p>After this, when the hour was now come when <lb/>
she must die, she cried to her husband &lpar;for he held her <lb/>
in his arms, as if he would have stayed her that she <lb/>
should not depart.</p>
<pb n="6" entity="b002082275_0031"/>
<p>"I see the boat of the dead, and Charon standing <lb/>
with his hand upon the pole, who calleth me, saying, <lb/>
'Hasten; thou delayest us'; and then again, 'A winged <lb/>
messenger of the dead looketh at me from under his dark <lb/>
eyebrows, and would lead me away. Dost thou not see <lb/>
him?'"</p>
<p>Then, after this, she seemed now ready to die, yet <lb/>
again she gathered strength, and said to the King:</p>
<p>"Listen, and I will tell thee before I die what I would <lb/>
have thee do. Thou knowest how I have given my life <lb/>
for thy life. For when I might have lived, and had for <lb/>
my husband any prince of Thessaly that I would, and <lb/>
dwelt here in wealth and royal state, yet could I not <lb/>
endure to be widowed of thee and that thy children <lb/>
should be fatherless. Therefore I spared not myself, <lb/>
though thy father and mother betrayed thee. But the <lb/>
gods have ordered all this after their own pleasure. So <lb/>
be it. Do thou therefore make this recompense, <lb/>
which indeed thou owest to me, for what will not a man <lb/>
give for his life? Thou lovest these children even as I <lb/>
love them. Suffer them then to be rulers in this house, <lb/>
and bring not a stepmother over them who shall hate <lb/>
them and deal with them unkindly. A son, indeed, <lb/>
hath a tower of strength in his father. But, O my <lb/>
daughter, how shall it fare with thee, for thy mother <lb/>
will not give thee in marriage, nor be with thee, <reg orig="com-|forting">comforting</reg> <lb/>
thee when a mother most showeth kindness and <lb/>
love. And now farewell, for I die this day. And thou, <lb/>
too, farewell, my husband. Thou losest a true wife, <lb/>
and ye, too, my children, a true mother."</p>
<p>Then Admetus made answer:</p>
<p>"Fear not, it shall be as thou wilt. I could not find <lb/>
other wife fair and well born and true as thou. Never <lb/>
<pb n="7" entity="b002082275_0032"/>
more shall I gather revellers in my palace, or crown my <lb/>
head with garlands, or hearken to the voice of music. <lb/>
Never shall I touch the harp or sing to the Libyan flute. <lb/>
And some cunning craftsman shall make an image <lb/>
fashioned like unto thee, and this I will hold in my <lb/>
arms and think of thee. Cold comfort indeed, yet that <lb/>
shall ease somewhat of the burden of my soul. But oh! <lb/>
that I had the voice and melody of Orpheus, for then had <lb/>
I gone down to Hell and persuaded the Queen thereof <lb/>
or her husband with my song to let thee go; nor would <lb/>
the watch-dog of Pluto, nor Charon that ferrieth the <lb/>
dead, have hindered me but that I had brought thee to <lb/>
the light. But do thou wait for me there, for there will <lb/>
I dwell with thee; and when I die they shall lay me by <lb/>
thy side, for never was wife so true as thou."</p>
<p>Then said Alcestis:</p>
<p>"Take these children as a gift from me, and be as a <lb/>
mother to them."</p>
<p>"O me!" he cried, "what shall I do, being bereaved <lb/>
of thee?"</p>
<p>And she said:</p>
<p>"Time will comfort thee; the dead are as nothing."</p>
<p>But he said:</p>
<p>"Nay, but let me depart with thee."</p>
<p>But the Queen made answer:</p>
<p>"'T is enough that I die in they stead."</p>
<p>And when she had thus spoken she gave up the ghost.</p>
<p>Then the King said to the old men that were gathered <lb/>
together to comfort him:</p>
<p>"I will see to this burial. And do ye sing a hymn as <lb/>
is meet to the god of the dead. And to all my people I <lb/>
make this decree; that they mourn for this woman, and <lb/>
clothe themselves in black, and shave their heads, and <lb/>
<pb n="8" entity="b002082275_0033"/>
that such as have horses cut off their manes, and that <lb/>
there be not heard in the city the voice of the flute or the <lb/>
sound of the harp for the space of twelve months."</p>
<p>Then the old men sang the hymn as they had been <lb/>
bidden. And when they had finished, it befell that <lb/>
Hercules, who was on a journey, came to the palace and <lb/>
asked whether King Admetus was sojourning there.</p>
<p>And the old men answered:</p>
<p>"'T is even so, Hercules. But what, I pray thee, <lb/>
bringeth thee to this land?"</p>
<p>"I am bound on an errand for King Eurystheus; <lb/>
even to bring back to him horses of King Diomed."</p>
<p>"How wilt thou do this? Dost thou not know this <lb/>
Diomed?"</p>
<p>"I know naught of him, nor of his land."</p>
<p>"Thou wilt not master him or his horses without <lb/>
blows."</p>
<p>"Even so, yet I may not refuse the tasks that are set <lb/>
to me."</p>
<p>"Thou art resolved then to do this thing or to die?"</p>
<p>"Ay; and this is not the first race that I have run."</p>
<p>"Thou wilt not easily bridle these horses."</p>
<p>"Why not? They breathe not fire from their <reg orig="nos-|trils">nostrils</reg>."</p>
<p>"No, but they devour the flesh of men."</p>
<p>"What sayest thou? This is the food of wild beasts <lb/>
not of horses."</p>
<p>"Yet 't is true. Thou wilt see their mangers four <lb/>
with blood."</p>
<p>"And the master of these steeds, whose son is he?"</p>
<p>"He is son of Ares, lord of the land of Thrace."</p>
<p>"Now this is a strange fate and a hard that maketh <lb/>
me fight ever with the sons of Ares, with Lycaon first <lb/>
<pb n="9" entity="b002082275_0034"/>
and with Cycnus next, and now with this King Diomed. <lb/>
But none shall ever see the son of Alcmena trembling <lb/>
before an enemy."</p>
<p>And now King Admetus came forth from the palace. <lb/>
And when the two had greeted one another, Hercules <lb/>
would fain know why the King had shaven his hair as <lb/>
one that mourned for the dead. And the King answered <lb/>
that he was about to bury that day one that was dear <lb/>
to him.</p>
<p>And when Hercules inquired yet further who this <lb/>
might be, the King said that his children were well, and <lb/>
his father also, and his mother. But of his wife he <lb/>
answered so that Hercules understood not that he spake <lb/>
of her. For he said that she was a stranger by blood, <lb/>
yet near in friendship, and that she had dwelt in his <lb/>
house, having been left an orphan of her father. <reg orig="Never-|theless">Nevertheless</reg> <lb/>
Hercules would have departed and found <reg orig="enter-|tainment">entertainment</reg> <lb/>
elsewhere, for he would not be troublesome to <lb/>
his host. But the King suffered him not. And to the <lb/>
servant that stood by he said:</p>
<p>"Take thou this guest to the guest-chamber; and see <lb/>
that they that have charge of these matters set <reg orig="abun-|dance">abundance</reg> <lb/>
of food before him. And take care that ye shut <lb/>
the doors between the chambers and the palace; for it <lb/>
is not meet that the guest at his meal should hear the <lb/>
cry of them that mourn."</p>
<p>And when the old men would know why the King, <lb/>
having so great a trouble upon him, yet entertained a <lb/>
guest, he made answer:</p>
<p>"Would ye have commended me the more if I had <lb/>
caused him to depart from this house and this city? <lb/>
For my sorrow had not been one whit the less, and I <lb/>
had lost the praise of hospitality. And a right worthy <lb/>
<pb n="10" entity="b002082275_0035"/>
host is he to me if ever I chance to visit the land of <lb/>
Argos."</p>
<p>And now they had finished all things for the burying <lb/>
of Alcestis, when the old man Pheres, the father of the <lb/>
King, approached, and servants came with him bearing <lb/>
robes and crowns and other adornments wherewith to <lb/>
do honour to the dead. And when he was come over <lb/>
against the bier whereon they laid the dead woman, he <lb/>
spake to the King, saying:</p>
<p>"I am come to mourn with thee, my son, for thou <lb/>
hast lost a noble wife. Only thou must endure, though <lb/>
this indeed is a hard thing. But take these adornments, <lb/>
for it is meet that she should be honoured who died for <lb/>
thee, and for me also, that I should not go down to the <lb/>
grave childless." And to the dead he said, "Fare thee <lb/>
well, noble wife, that hast kept this house from falling. <lb/>
May it be well with thee in the dwellings of the dead!"</p>
<p>But the King answered him in great wrath:</p>
<p>"I did not bid thee to this burial, nor shall this dead <lb/>
woman be adorned with gifts of thine. Who are thou <lb/>
that thou shouldest bewail her? Surely thou art not <lb/>
father of mine. For being come to extreme old age, <lb/>
yet thou wouldst not die for thy son, but sufferedst this <lb/>
woman, being a stranger in blood, to die for me. Her, <lb/>
therefore, I count father and mother also. Yet this <lb/>
had been a noble deed for thee, seeing that the span of <lb/>
life that was left to thee was short. And I, too, had not <lb/>
been left to live out my days thus miserably, bereaved <lb/>
of her whom I loved. Hast thou not had all happiness, <lb/>
thus having lived in kingly power from youth to age? <lb/>
And thou wouldst have left a son to come after thee, <lb/>
that thy house should not be spoiled by thine enemies. <lb/>
Have I not always done due reverence to thee and to <lb/>
<pb n="11" entity="b002082275_0036"/>
my mother? And, lo! this is the recompense that ye <lb/>
make me. Wherefore I say to thee, make haste and <lb/>
raise other sons who may nourish thee in thy old age, <lb/>
and pay thee due honour when thou art dead, for I will <lb/>
not bury thee. To thee I am dead."</p>
<p>Then the old man spake:</p>
<p>"Thinkest thou that thou art driving some Lydian <lb/>
and Phrygian slave that hath been bought with money, <lb/>
and forgettest that I am a freeborn man of Thessaly, as <lb/>
my father was freeborn before me? I reared thee to <lb/>
rule this house after me; but to die for thee, that I owed <lb/>
thee not. This is no custom among the Greeks that a <lb/>
father should die for his son. To thyself thou livest or <lb/>
diest. All that was thy due thou hast received of me; <lb/>
the kingdom over many people, and, in due time, <lb/>
broad lands which I also received of my father. How <lb/>
have I wronged thee? Of what have I defrauded thee? <lb/>
I ask thee not to die for me; and I die not for thee. Thou <lb/>
lovest to behold this light. Thinkest thou that thy father <lb/>
loveth it not? For the years of the dead are very long; <lb/>
but the days of the living are short yet sweet withal. <lb/>
But I say to thee that thou hast fled from thy fate in <lb/>
shameless fashion, and hast slain this woman. Yea, a <lb/>
woman hath vanquished thee, and yet thou chargest <lb/>
cowardice against me. In truth, 't is a wise device of <lb/>
thine that thou mayest live forever, if marrying many <lb/>
times, thou canst still persuade thy wife to die for thee. <lb/>
Be silent, then, for shame's sake; and if thou lovest life, <lb/>
remember that others love it also."</p>
<p>So King Admetus and his father reproached each <lb/>
other with many unseemly words. And when the old <lb/>
man had departed, they carried forth Alcestis to her <lb/>
burial.</p>
<pb n="12" entity="b002082275_0037"/>
<p>But when they that bare the body had departed <lb/>
there came in the old man that had the charge of the <lb/>
guest-chambers, and spake, saying:</p>
<p>"I have seen many guests that have come from all the <lb/>
lands under the sun to this palace of Admetus, but <lb/>
never have I given entertainment to such evil guest as <lb/>
this. For first, knowing that my lord was in sore trouble <lb/>
and sorrow, he forebore not to enter these gates. And <lb/>
then he took his entertainment in most unseemly <lb/>
fashion; for if he lacked aught he would call loudly for <lb/>
it; and then, taking a great cup wreathed with leaves of <lb/>
ivy in his hands, he drank of red wine untempered with <lb/>
water. And when the food had warmed him, he <lb/>
crowned his head with myrtle boughs, and sang in the <lb/>
vilest fashion. Then might one hear two melodies, <lb/>
this fellow's songs, which he sang without thought for <lb/>
the troubles of my lord and the lamentation wherewith <lb/>
we servants lamented our mistress. But we suffered <lb/>
not this stranger to see our tears, for so may lord had <lb/>
commanded. Surely this is a grievous thing that I <lb/>
must entertain this stranger, who surely is some thief <lb/>
or robber. And meanwhile they have taken my <reg orig="mis-|tress">mistress</reg> <lb/>
to her grave, and I followed not after her, nor <lb/>
reached my hand to her, that was as a mother to all that <lb/>
dwell in this place."</p>
<p>When the man had so spoken, Hercules came forth <lb/>
from the guest-chamber, crowned with myrtle, and his <lb/>
face flushed with wine. And he cried to the servant, <lb/>
saying:</p>
<p>"Ho, there! why lookest thou so solemn and full of <lb/>
care? Thou shouldst not scowl on thy guest after this <lb/>
fashion, being full of some sorrow that concerns thee <lb/>
not nearly. Come hither, and I will teach thee to be <lb/>
<pb n="13" entity="b002082275_0038"/>
wiser. Knowest thou what manner of thing the life of <lb/>
a man is? I trow not. Hearken therefore. There <lb/>
is not a man who knoweth what a day may <lb/>
bring forth. Therefore I say to thee: Make glad thy <lb/>
heart; eat, drink, count the day that now is to be thine <lb/>
own, but all else to be doubtful. As for all other things, <lb/>
let them be, and hearken to my words. Put away this <lb/>
great grief that lieth upon thee, and enter into this <lb/>
chamber. Right soon shall I ease thee of these gloomy <lb/>
thoughts. As thou art a man, be wise after the fashion <lb/>
of a man; for to them that are of a gloomy countenance, <lb/>
life, if only I judge rightly, is not life but trouble only."</p>
<p>Then the servant answered:</p>
<p>"All this I know; but we have fared so ill in this house <lb/>
that mirth and laughter ill beseem us."</p>
<p>"But they tell me that this dead woman was a <lb/>
stranger. Why shouldst thou be so troubled, seeing <lb/>
that they who rule this house yet live?"</p>
<p>"How sayest thou that they live? Thou knowest not <lb/>
what trouble we endure."</p>
<p>"I know it, unless thy lord strangely deceived me."</p>
<p>"My lord is given to hospitality."</p>
<p>"And should it hinder him that there is some <lb/>
stranger dead in the house?"</p>
<p>"A stranger, sayest thou? 'T is passing strange to <lb/>
call her thus."</p>
<p>"Hath thy lord then suffered some sorrow that he <lb/>
told thee not?'</p>
<p>"Even so, or I had not loathed to see thee at thy <lb/>
revels. Thou seest this shaven hair and these black <lb/>
robes."</p>
<p>"What then? Who is dead? One of thy lord's <lb/>
children, or the old man, his father?"</p>
<pb n="14" entity="b002082275_0039"/>
<p>"Stranger, 't is the wife of Admetus that is dead."</p>
<p>"What sayest thou? And yet he gave me <reg orig="entertain-|ment">entertainment</reg>?"</p>
<p>"Yea, for he would not, for shame, turn thee from <lb/>
his house."</p>
<p>"O miserable man, what a helpmeet thou hast lost!"</p>
<p>"Ay, and we are all lost with her."</p>
<p>"Well I knew it; for I saw the tears in his eyes, and <lb/>
his head shaven, and his sorrowful regard; but he <lb/>
deceived me, saying that the dead woman was a stranger. <lb/>
Therefore did I enter the doors and make merry, and <lb/>
crown myself with garlands, not knowing what had <lb/>
befallen my host. But, come, tell me; where doth he <lb/>
bury her? Where shall I find her?"</p>
<p>"Follow straight along the road that leadeth to <lb/>
Larissa, and thou shalt see her tomb in the outskirts of <lb/>
the city."</p>
<p>Then said Hercules to himself:</p>
<p>"O my heart, thou hast dared many great deeds <lb/>
before this day; and now most of all must I show myself <lb/>
a true son of Zeus. Now will I save this dead woman <lb/>
Alcestis, and give her back to her husband, and make <lb/>
due recompense to Admetus. I will go, therefore, and <lb/>
watch for this black-robed king, even Death. <reg orig="Me-|thinks">Methinks</reg> <lb/>
I shall find him nigh unto the tomb, drinking the <lb/>
blood of the sacrifices. There will I lie in wait for him, <lb/>
and run upon him, and throw my arms about him, nor <lb/>
shall anyone deliver him out of my hands, till he have <lb/>
given up to me this woman. But if it chance that I find <lb/>
him not there, and he come not to the feast of blood, I <lb/>
will go down to the Queen of Hell, to the land where <lb/>
the sun shineth not, and beg her of the Queen; and <lb/>
doubtless she will give her to me, that I may give her to <lb/>
<pb n="15" entity="b002082275_0040"/>
her husband. Right nobly did he entertain me, and <lb/>
drave me not from his house, for all that he had been <lb/>
stricken by such sorrow. Is there a man in Thessaly, <lb/>
nay in the whole land of Greece, that is such a lover of <lb/>
hospitality? I trow not. Noble is he, and he shall <lb/>
know that he is no ill friend to whom he hath done this <lb/>
thing."</p>
<p>So Hercules went his way. And when he was gone <lb/>
Admetus came back from the burying of his wife, a <lb/>
great company following him, of whom the elders <lb/>
sought to comfort him in his sorrow. And when he <lb/>
was come to the gates of his palace he cried:</p>
<p>"How shall I enter thee? how shall I dwell in thee? <lb/>
Once I came within thy gates with many pine-torches <lb/>
from Pelion, and the merry noise of the marriage song, <lb/>
holding in my hand the hand of her that is dead; and <lb/>
after us followed a troop that magnified her and me, so <lb/>
noble a pair we were. And now with wailing instead <lb/>
of marriage songs, and garments of black for white <lb/>
wedding robes, I go to my desolate couch."</p>
<p>But while he yet lingered before the palace Hercules <lb/>
came back, leading with him a woman that was covered <lb/>
with a veil. And when he saw the King, he said:</p>
<p>"I hold it well to speak freely to one that is a friend, <lb/>
and that a man should not hide a grudge in his heart. <lb/>
Hear me, therefore. Though I was worthy to be counted <lb/>
thy friend, yet thou saidst not that thy wife lay dead in <lb/>
thy house, but suffered me to feast and make merry. <lb/>
For this, therefore, I blame thee. And now I will tell <lb/>
thee why I am returned. I pray thee, keep this woman <lb/>
against the day when I shall come back from the land of <lb/>
Thrace, bringing the horses of King Diomed. And if <lb/>
it should fare ill with me, let her abide here and serve <lb/>
<pb n="16" entity="b002082275_0041"/>
thee. Not without toil came she into my hands. I <lb/>
found as I went upon my way that certain men had <lb/>
ordered contests for wrestlers and runners, and the <lb/>
like. Now for them that had the pre&euml;minence in lesser <lb/>
things there were horses for prizes; and for the greater, as <lb/>
wrestling and boxing, a reward of oxen, to which was <lb/>
added this woman. And now I would have thee keep <lb/>
her, for which thing, haply, thou wilt one day thank me."</p>
<p>To this the King answered:</p>
<p>"I thought no slight when I hid this truth from thee. <lb/>
Only it would have been for me sorrow upon sorrow <lb/>
if thou hadst gone to the house of another. But as for <lb/>
this woman, I would have thee ask this thing of some <lb/>
prince of Thessaly that hath not suffered such grief as I. <lb/>
In Pher&aelig; here thou hast many friends; but I could not <lb/>
look upon her without tears. Add not then this new <lb/>
trouble. And also how could she, being young, abide <lb/>
in my house, for young I judge her to be? And of a <lb/>
truth, lady, thou art very like in shape and stature to <lb/>
my Alcestis that is dead. I pray you, take her from my <lb/>
sight, for she troubleth my heart, and my tears run <lb/>
over with beholding her."</p>
<p>Then said Hercules:</p>
<p>"Would I had such strength that I could bring back <lb/>
thy wife from the dwellings of the dead, and put her in <lb/>
thy hands."</p>
<p>"I know thy good will, but what profiteth it? No <lb/>
man may bring back the dead."</p>
<p>"Well, time will soften thy grief, which yet is new."</p>
<p>"Yea, if by time thou meanest death."</p>
<p>"But a new wife will comfort thee."</p>
<p>"Hold thy peace; such a thing cometh not into my <lb/>
thoughts."</p>
<pb n="17" entity="b002082275_0042"/>
<p>"What? wilt thou always keep this widowed state?"</p>
<p>"Never shall woman more be wife of mine."</p>
<p>"What will this profit her that is dead?"</p>
<p>"I know not, yet had I sooner die than be false to <lb/>
her."</p>
<p>"Yet I would have thee take this woman into thy <lb/>
house."</p>
<p>"Ask it not of me, I entreat thee, by thy father Zeus."</p>
<p>"Thou wilt lose much if thou wilt not do it."</p>
<p>"And if I do it I shall break my heart."</p>
<p>"Haply some day thou wilt thank me; only be <reg orig="per-|suaded">persuaded</reg>."</p>
<p>"Be it so; they shall take the woman into the house."</p>
<p>"I would not have thee entrust her to thy servants."</p>
<p>"If thou so thinkest, lead her in thyself."</p>
<p>"Nay, but I would give her into thy hands."</p>
<p>"I touch her not, but my house she may enter."</p>
<p>"'T is only to thy hand I entrust her."</p>
<p>"O King, thou compellest me to this against my <lb/>
will."</p>
<p>"Stretch forth thy hand and touch her."</p>
<p>"I touch her as I would touch the Gorgon's head."</p>
<p>"Hast thou hold of her?"</p>
<p>"I have hold."</p>
<p>"Then keep her safe, and say that the son of Zeus is <lb/>
a noble friend. See if she be like thy wife; and change <lb/>
thy sorrow for joy."</p>
<p>And when the King looked, lo! the veiled woman was <lb/>
Alcestis his wife.</p>

ANTIGONE</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">It befell</hi> in times past that the gods, being angry <lb/>
with the inhabitants of Thebes, sent into their <lb/>
land a very noisome beast which men called the <lb/>
Sphinx. Now this beast had the face and breast of a fair <lb/>
woman, but the feet and claws of a lion; and it was wont <lb/>
to ask a riddle of such as encountered it; and such as <lb/>
answered not aright it would tear and devour.</p>
<p>When it had laid waste the land many days, there <lb/>
chanced to come to Thebes one &OElig;dipus, who had fled <lb/>
from the city of Corinth that he might escape the doom <lb/>
which the gods had spoken against him. And the men <lb/>
of the place told him of the Sphinx, how she cruelly <lb/>
devoured the people, and that he who should deliver <lb/>
them from her should have the kingdom. So &OElig;dipus, <lb/>
being very bold, and also ready of wit, went forth to <lb/>
meet the monster. And when she saw him she spake <lb/>
saying: <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"Read m this riddle right, or die:</l>
<l>What liveth there beneath the sky,</l>
<l>Four-footed creature that doth choose</l>
<l>Now three feet and now twain to use,</l>
<l>And still more feebly o'er the plain</l>
<l>Walketh with three feet than with twain?"</l>
</lg></q>
And &OElig;dipus made reply: <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"'T is man, who in life's early day</l>
<l>Four-footed crawleth on his way;</l>
<pb n="19" entity="b002082275_0044"/>
<l>When time hath made his strength complete,</l>
<l>Upright his form and twain his feet;</l>
<l>When age hath bowed him to the ground</l>
<l>A third foot in his staff is found."</l>
</lg></q>
And when the Sphinx found that her riddle was <reg orig="an-|swered">answered</reg>, <lb/>
she cast herself from a high rock and perished.</p>
<p>For a while &OElig;dipus reigned in great power and glory; <lb/>
but afterwards in madness he put out his own eyes. <lb/>
Then his two sons cast him into prison, and took his <lb/>
kingdom, making agreement between themselves that <lb/>
each should reign for the space of one year. And the <lb/>
elder of the two, whose name was Eteocles, first had <lb/>
the kingdom; but when his year was come to an end <lb/>
he would not abide by his promise, but kept that <lb/>
which he should have given up, and drave out his <lb/>
younger brother from the city. Then the younger, <lb/>
whose name was Polynices, fled to Argos, to King <lb/>
Adrastus. And after a while he married the daughter <lb/>
of the King, who made a covenant with him that he <lb/>
would bring him back with a high hand to Thebes, and <lb/>
set him on the throne of his father. Then the King sent <lb/>
messengers to certain of the princes of Greece, <reg orig="entreat-|ing">entreating</reg> <lb/>
that they would help in this matter. And of these <lb/>
some would not, but others hearkened to his words, so <lb/>
that a great army was gathered together and followed <lb/>
the King and Polynices to make war against Thebes. <lb/>
So they came and pitched their camp over against the <lb/>
city. And after they had been there many days, the <lb/>
battle grew fierce about the wall. But the chiefest <lb/>
fight was between the two brothers, for the two came <lb/>
together in an open space before the gates. And first <lb/>
Polynices prayed to Her&eacute;, for she was the goddess of <lb/>
the great city of Argos, which had helped him in this <lb/>
<pb n="20" entity="b002082275_0045"/>
enterprise, and Eteocles prayed to Pallas of the Golden <lb/>
Shield, whose temple stood hard by. Then they <lb/>
crouched, each covered with his shield, and holding his <lb/>
spear in his hand, if by chance his enemy should give <lb/>
occasion to smite him; and if one showed so much as an <lb/>
eye above the rim of his shield the other would strike at <lb/>
him. But after a while King Eteocles slipped upon a <lb/>
stone that was under his foot, and uncovered his leg, <lb/>
at which straightway Polynices took aim with his spear, <lb/>
piercing the skin. But so doing he laid his own <lb/>
shoulder bare, and King Eteocles gave him a wound in <lb/>
the breast. He brake his spear in striking, and would <lb/>
have fared ill but that with a great stone he smote the <lb/>
spear of Polynices, and brake this also in the middle. <lb/>
And now were the two equal, for each had lost his spear. <lb/>
So they drew their swords and came yet closer together. <lb/>
But Eteocles used a device which he had learnt in the <lb/>
land of Thessaly; for he drew his left foot back, as if he <lb/>
would have ceased from the battle, and then of a sudden <lb/>
moved the right forward; and so smiting sideways, drave <lb/>
his sword right through the body of Polynices. But <lb/>
when thinking that he had slain him he set his weapons <lb/>
in the earth, and began to spoil him of his arms, the <lb/>
other, for he yet breathed a little, laid his hand upon his <lb/>
sword, and though he had scarce strength to smite, yet <lb/>
gave the King a mortal blow, so that the two lay dead <lb/>
together on the plain. And the men of Thebes lifted <lb/>
up the bodies of the dead, and bare them both into the <lb/>
city.</p>
<p>When these two brothers, the sons of King &OElig;dipus, <lb/>
had fallen each by the hand of the other, the kingdom <lb/>
fell to Creon their uncle. For not only was he the next <lb/>
of kin to the dead, but also the people held him in great <lb/>
<pb n="21" entity="b002082275_0046"/>
honour because his son Men&oelig;ceus had offered himself <lb/>
with a willing heart that he might deliver his city from <lb/>
captivity.</p>
<p>Now when Creon was come to the throne, he made a <lb/>
proclamation about the two princes, commanding that <lb/>
they should bury Eteocles with all honour, seeing that <lb/>
he died as beseemed a good man and a brave, doing <lb/>
battle for his country, that it should not be delivered <lb/>
into the hands of the enemy; but as for Polynices he bade <lb/>
them leave his body to be devoured by the fowls of the <lb/>
air and the beasts of the field, because he had joined <lb/>
himself to the enemy, and would have beaten down the <lb/>
walls of the city, and burned the temples of the gods <lb/>
with fire, and led the people captive. Also he <reg orig="com-|manded">commanded</reg> <lb/>
that if any man should break this decree he <lb/>
should suffer death by stoning.</p>
<p>Now Antigone, who was sister to the two princes, <lb/>
heard that the decree had gone forth, and chancing to <lb/>
meet her sister Ismen&eacute; before the gates of the palace, <lb/>
spake to her, saying:</p>
<p>"O my sister, hast thou heard this decree that the King <lb/>
hath put forth concerning our brethren that are dead?"</p>
<p>Then Ismen&eacute; made answer: "I have heard nothing <lb/>
my sister, only that we are bereaved of both of our <lb/>
brethren in one day, and that the army of the Argives <lb/>
is departed in this night that is now past. So much I <lb/>
know, but no more."</p>
<p>"Hearken then. King Creon hath made a <reg orig="proclama-|tion">proclamation</reg> <lb/>
that they shall bury Eteocles with all honour; but <lb/>
that Polynices shall lie unburied, that the birds of the <lb/>
air and the beasts of the field may devour him; and that <lb/>
whosoever shall break this decree shall suffer death by <lb/>
stoning."</p>
<pb n="22" entity="b002082275_0047"/>
<p>"But if it be so, my sister, how can we avail to <lb/>
change it?"</p>
<p>"Think whether or no thou wilt share with me the <lb/>
doing of this deed."</p>
<p>"What deed? What meanest thou?"</p>
<p>"To pay due honour to this dead body."</p>
<p>"What? Wilt thou bury him when the King hath <lb/>
forbidden it?"</p>
<p>"Yea, for he is my brother and also thine, though, <lb/>
perchance, thou wouldst not have it so. And I will not <lb/>
play him false."</p>
<p>"O my sister, wilt thou do this when Creon hath <reg orig="for-|bidden">forbidden</reg> <lb/>
it?"</p>
<p>"Why should he stand between me and mine?"</p>
<p>"But think now what sorrows are come upon our <lb/>
house. For our father perished miserably, having first <lb/>
put out his own eyes; and our mother hanged herself <lb/>
with her own hands; and our two brothers fell in one <lb/>
day, each by the other's spear; and now we two only <lb/>
are left. And shall we not fall into a worse destruction <lb/>
than any, if we transgress these commands of the King? <lb/>
Think, too, that we are women and not men, and of <lb/>
necessity obey them that are stronger. Wherefore, as <lb/>
for me, I will pray the dead to pardon me, seeing that I <lb/>
am thus constrained; but I will obey them that rule."</p>
<p>"I advise thee not, and, if thou thinkest thus, I would <lb/>
not have thee for helper. But know that I will bury <lb/>
my brother, nor could I better die than for doing such a <lb/>
deed. For as he loved me, so also do I love him greatly. <lb/>
And shall not I do pleasure to the dead rather than to <lb/>
the living, seeing that I shall abide with the dead for <lb/>
ever? But thou, if thou wilt, do dishonour to the laws <lb/>
of the gods?"</p>
<pb n="23" entity="b002082275_0048"/>
<p>"I dishonour them not. Only I cannot set myself <lb/>
against the powers that be."</p>
<p>"So be it; but I will bury my brother."</p>
<p>"O my sister, how I fear for thee!"</p>
<p>"Fear for thyself. Thine own lot needeth all thy care."</p>
<p>"Thou wilt at least keep thy counsel, nor tell the <lb/>
thing to any man."</p>
<p>"Not so: hide it not. I shall scorn thee more if thou <lb/>
proclaim it not aloud to all."</p>
<p>So Antigone departed; and after a while came to the <lb/>
same place King Creon, clad in his royal robes, and with <lb/>
his sceptre in his hand, and set forth his counsel to the <lb/>
elders who were assembled, how he had dealt with the <lb/>
two princes according to their deserving, giving all <lb/>
honour to him that loved his country and casting forth <lb/>
the other unburied. And he bade them take care that <lb/>
this decree should be kept, saying that he had also <lb/>
appointed certain men to watch the dead body.</p>
<p>But he had scarcely left speaking when there came <lb/>
one of these same watchers and said:</p>
<p>"I have not come hither in haste, O King, nay, I <lb/>
doubted much, while I was yet on the way, whether I <lb/>
should not turn again. For now I thought, 'Fool, <lb/>
why goest thou where thou shalt suffer for it'; and <lb/>
then, again, 'Fool, the King will hear the matter <reg orig="else-|where">elsewhere</reg>, <lb/>
and then how wilt thou fare?' But at the last <lb/>
I came as I had purposed, for I know that nothing may <lb/>
happen to me contrary to fate."</p>
<p>"But say," said the King, "what troubles thee so <lb/>
much?"</p>
<p>"First hear my case. I did not the thing, and know <lb/>
not who did it, and it were a grievous wrong should I fall <lb/>
into trouble for such a cause."</p>
<pb n="24" entity="b002082275_0049"/>
<p>"Thou makest a long preface, excusing thyself, but <lb/>
yet hast, as I judge, something to tell."</p>
<p>"Fear, my lord, ever causeth delay."</p>
<p>"Wilt thou not speak out thy news and then begone?"</p>
<p>"I will speak it. Know then that some man hath <lb/>
thrown dust upon this dead corpse, and done besides <lb/>
such things as are needful."</p>
<p>"What sayest thou? Who hath dared to do this <lb/>
deed?"</p>
<p>"That I know not, for there was no mark as of spade <lb/>
or pick-axe; nor was the earth broken, nor had wagon <lb/>
passed thereon. We were sore dismayed when the <lb/>
watchman showed the thing to us; for the body we could <lb/>
not see. Buried indeed it was not, but rather covered <lb/>
with dust. Nor was there any sign as of wild beast or <lb/>
of dog that had torn it. Then there arose a contention <lb/>
among us, each blaming the other, and accusing his <lb/>
fellows, and himself denying that he had done the <lb/>
deed or was privy to it. And doubtless we had fallen <lb/>
to blows but that one spake a word which made us all <lb/>
tremble for fear, knowing that it must be as he said. <lb/>
For he said that the thing must be told to thee, and in <lb/>
no wise hidden. So we drew lots, and by evil chance <lb/>
the lot fell upon me. Wherefore I am here, not willingly, <lb/>
for no man loveth him that bringing evil tidings."</p>
<p>Then said the chief of the old men:</p>
<p>"Consider, O King, for haply this thing is from the <lb/>
gods."</p>
<p>But the King cried:</p>
<p>"Thinkest thou that the gods care for such an one <lb/>
as this dead man, who would have burnt their temples <lb/>
with fire, and laid waste the land which they love, <lb/>
and set at naught the laws? Not so But there <lb/>
<pb n="25" entity="b002082275_0050"/>
are men in this city who have long time had ill will <lb/>
to me, not bowing their necks to my yoke; and <lb/>
they have persuaded these fellows with money to do this <lb/>
thing. Surely there never was so evil a thing as money, <lb/>
which maketh cities into ruinous heaps, and banisheth <lb/>
men from their houses, and turneth their thoughts from <lb/>
good unto evil. But as for them that have done this <lb/>
deed for hire, of a truth they shall not escape, for I say <lb/>
to thee, fellow, if ye bring not here before my eyes the <lb/>
man that did this thing, I will hang you up alive. So <lb/>
shall ye learn that ill gains bring no profit to a man."</p>
<p>So the guard departed; but as he went he said to <reg orig="him-|self">himself</reg>:</p>
<p>"Now may the gods grant that the man be found; <lb/>
but however this may be, thou shalt not see me come <lb/>
again on such errand as this, for even now have I <reg orig="es-|caped">escaped</reg> <lb/>
beyond all hope."</p>
<p>Notwithstanding, after a space he came back with <lb/>
one of his fellows; and they brought with them the <lb/>
maiden Antigone, with her hands bound together.</p>
<p>And it chanced that at the same time King Creon <lb/>
came forth from the palace. Then the guard set forth <lb/>
the thing to him, saying:</p>
<p>"We cleared away the dust from the dead body, and <lb/>
sat watching it. And when it was now noon, and the <lb/>
sun was at his height, there came a whirlwind over the <lb/>
plain, driving a great cloud of dust. And when this had <lb/>
passed, we looked, and lo! this maiden whom we have <lb/>
brought hither stood by the dead corpse. And when she <lb/>
saw that it lay bare as before, she sent up an exceeding <lb/>
bitter cry, even as a bird whose young ones have been <lb/>
taken from the nest. Then she cursed them that had <lb/>
done this deed; and brought dust and sprinkled it upon <lb/>
<pb n="26" entity="b002082275_0051"/>
the dead man, and poured water upon him three times <lb/>
Then we ran and laid hold upon her, and accused her <lb/>
that she had done this deed; and she denied it not. But <lb/>
as for me, 't is well to have escaped from death, but it <lb/>
is ill to bring friends into the same. Yet I hold that <lb/>
there is nothing dearer to a man than his life."</p>
<p>Then said the King to Antigone:</p>
<p>"Tell me in a word, didst thou know my decree?"</p>
<p>"I knew it. Was it not plainly declared?"</p>
<p>"How daredst thou to transgress the laws?"</p>
<p>"Zeus made not such laws, nor Justice that dwelleth <lb/>
with the gods below. I judged not that thy decrees had <lb/>
such authority that a man should transgress for them <lb/>
the unwritten sure commandments of the gods. For <lb/>
these, indeed, are not of to-day or yesterday, but they <lb/>
live for ever, and their beginning no man knoweth. <lb/>
Should I, for fear of thee, be found guilty against them? <lb/>
That I should die I knew. Why not? All men must <lb/>
die. And if I die before my time, what loss? He who <lb/>
liveth among many sorrows even as I have lived, <lb/>
counteth it gain to die. But had I left my own mother's <lb/>
son unburied, this had been loss indeed."</p>
<p>Then said the King:</p>
<p>"Such stubborn thoughts have a speedy fall, and are <lb/>
shivered even as the iron that hath been made hard in <lb/>
the furnace. And as for this woman and her sister &mdash; <lb/>
for I judge her sister to have had a part in this matter <lb/>
&mdash; though they were nearer to me than all my kindred, <lb/>
yet shall they not escape the doom of death. <reg orig="Where-|fore">Wherefore</reg> <lb/>
let some one bring the other woman hither."</p>
<p>And while they went to fetch the maiden Ismen&eacute;, <lb/>
Antigone said to the King.</p>
<p>"Is it not enough for thee to slay me? What need to <lb/>
<pb n="27" entity="b002082275_0052"/>
say more? For thy words please me not nor mine thee. <lb/>
Yet what nobler thing could I have done than to bury <lb/>
my mother's son? And so would all men say but fear <lb/>
shutteth their mouths."</p>
<p>"Nay," said the King, "none of the children of <reg orig="Cad-|mus">Cadmus</reg> <lb/>
thinketh thus, but thou only. But, hold, was not <lb/>
he that fell in battle with this man thy brother also?"</p>
<p>"Yes, truly, my brother he was."</p>
<p>"And dost thou not dishonour him when thou <lb/>
honourest his enemy?"</p>
<p>"The dead man would not say it, could he speak."</p>
<p>"Shall then the wicked have like honour with the <lb/>
good?"</p>
<p>"How knowest thou but that such honour pleaseth <lb/>
the gods below?"</p>
<p>"I have no love for them I hate, though they be dead."</p>
<p>"Of hating I know nothing 't is enough for me to <lb/>
love."</p>
<p>"If thou wilt love, go love the dead. But while I <lb/>
live no woman shall rule me."</p>
<p>Then those that had been sent to fetch the maiden <lb/>
Ismen&eacute; brought her forth from the palace. And when <lb/>
the King accused her that she had been privy to the deed <lb/>
she denied not, but would have shared one lot with her <lb/>
sister.</p>
<p>But Antigone turned from her, saying:</p>
<p>"Not so; thou hast no part or lot in the matter. For <lb/>
thou hast chosen life, and I have chosen death; and even <lb/>
so shall it be."</p>
<p>And when Ismen&eacute; saw that she prevailed nothing <lb/>
with her sister, she turned to the King and said:</p>
<p>"Wilt thou slay the bride of thy son?"</p>
<p>"Ay," said he, "there are other brides to win!"</p>
<pb n="28" entity="b002082275_0053"/>
<p>"But none," she made reply, "that accord so well <lb/>
with him."</p>
<p>"I will have no evil wives for my sons," said the <lb/>
King.</p>
<p>Then cried Antigone</p>
<p>"O H&aelig;mon, whom <unclear id="u3">love,</unclear> how hy father wrongeth <lb/>
thee!"</p>
<p>Then the King bade the guards lead the two into the <lb/>
palace. But scarcely had they gone when there came <lb/>
to the place the Prince H&aelig;mon, the King's son, who <lb/>
was betrothed to the maiden Antigone. And when the <lb/>
King saw him, he said:</p>
<p>"Art thou content, my son, with thy father's <reg orig="judg-|ment">judgment</reg>?"</p>
<p>And the young man answered:</p>
<p>"My father, I would follow thy counsels in all things." <lb/>
Then said the King:</p>
<p>"'T is well spoken, my son. This is a thing to be <lb/>
desired, that a man should have obedient children. But <lb/>
if it be otherwise with a man, he hath gotten great <lb/>
trouble for himself, and maketh sport for them that <lb/>
hate him. And now as to this matter. There is naught <lb/>
worse than an evil wife. Wherefore I say let this <reg orig="dam-|sel">damsel</reg> <lb/>
wed a bridegroom among the dead. For since I <lb/>
have found her, alone of all this people, breaking my <lb/>
decree, surely she shall die. Nor shall it profit her to <lb/>
claim kinship with me, for he that would rule a city <lb/>
must first deal justly with his own kindred. And as for <lb/>
obedience, this it is that maketh a city to stand both in <lb/>
peace and in war."</p>
<p>To this the Prince H&aelig;mon made answer:</p>
<p>"What thou sayest, my father, I do not judge. Yet <lb/>
bethink thee, that I see and hear on thy behalf what is <lb/>
<pb n="29" entity="b002082275_0054"/>
hidden from thee. For common men cannot abide <lb/>
thy look if they say that which pleaseth thee not. Yet <lb/>
do I hear it in secret. Know then that all the city <lb/>
mourneth for this maiden, saying that she dieth <reg orig="wrong-|fully">wrongfully</reg> <lb/>
for a very noble deed, in that she buried her brother. <lb/>
And 't is well, my father, not to be wholly set on thy <lb/>
thoughts, but to listen to the counsels of others."</p>
<p>"Nay," said the King; "shall I be taught by such an <lb/>
one as thou?"</p>
<p>"I pray thee regard my words, if they be well, and not <lb/>
my years."</p>
<p>"Can it be well to honour them that transgress? <lb/>
And hath not this woman transgressed?"</p>
<p>"The people of this city judgeth not so."</p>
<p>"The people, sayest thou? Is it for them to rule, or <lb/>
for me?"</p>
<p>"No city is the possession of one man only."</p>
<p>So the two answered one the other, and their anger <lb/>
waxed hot. And at the last the King cried:</p>
<p>"Bring this accursed woman, and slay her before his <lb/>
eyes."</p>
<p>And the Prince answered:</p>
<p>"That thou shalt never do. And know this also, <lb/>
that thou shalt never see my face again."</p>
<p>So he went away in a rage; and the old men would <lb/>
have appeased the King's wrath, but he would not <lb/>
hearken to them, but said that the two maidens should <lb/>
die.</p>
<p>"Wilt thou then slay them both?" said the old men.</p>
<p>"'T is well said," the King made answer. "Her that <lb/>
meddled not with the matter I harm not."</p>
<p>"And how wilt thou deal with the other?"</p>
<p>"There is a desolate place, and there I will shut <unclear id="u4">her</unclear> <lb/>
<pb n="30" entity="b002082275_0055"/>
up alive in a sepulchre; yet giving her so much of food <lb/>
as shall quit us of guilt in the matter, for I would not <lb/>
have the city defiled. There let her persuade Death <lb/>
whom she loveth so much, that he harm her not."</p>
<p>So the guards led Antigone away to shut her up alive <lb/>
in the sepulchre. But scarcely had they departed <lb/>
when there came an old prophet Tiresias, seeking <lb/>
the King. Blind he was, so that a boy led him by the <lb/>
hand; but the gods had given him to see things to <lb/>
come.</p>
<p>And when the King saw him he asked:</p>
<p>"What seekest thou, wisest of men?"</p>
<p>Then the prophet answered:</p>
<p>"Hearken, O King, and I will tell thee. I sat in my <lb/>
seat, after my custom, in the place whither all manner <lb/>
of birds resort. And as I sat I heard a cry of birds that <lb/>
I knew not, very strange and full of wrath. And I knew <lb/>
that they tare and slew each other, for I heard the fierce <lb/>
flapping of their wings. And being afraid, I made <lb/>
inquiry about the fire, how it burned upon the altars. <lb/>
And this boy, for as I am a guide to others so he guideth <lb/>
me, told me that it shone not at all, but smouldered and <lb/>
was dull, and that the flesh which was burnt upon the <lb/>
altar spluttered in the flame, and wasted away into <lb/>
corruption and filthiness. And now I tell thee, O King, <lb/>
that the city is troubled by thy ill counsels. For the <lb/>
dogs and the birds of the air tear the flesh of this dead <lb/>
son of &OElig;dipus, whom thou sufferest not to have due <lb/>
burial, and carry it to the altars, polluting them <reg orig="there-|with">therewith</reg>. <lb/>
Wherefore the gods receive not from us prayer <lb/>
or sacrifice; and the cry of the birds hath an evil sound, <lb/>
for they are full of the flesh of a man. Therefore I bid <lb/>
thee be wise in time. For all men may err; but he that <lb/>
<pb n="31" entity="b002082275_0056"/>
keepeth not his folly, but repenteth, doeth well; but <lb/>
stubbornness cometh to great trouble."</p>
<p>Then the King answered:</p>
<p>"Old man, I know the race of prophets full well, how <lb/>
ye sell your art for gold. But, make thy trade as thou <lb/>
wilt, this man shall not have burial; yea, though the <lb/>
eagles of Zeus carry his flesh to their master's throne in <lb/>
heaven, he shall not have it."</p>
<p>And when the prophet spake again, entreating him, <lb/>
and warning, the King answered him after the same <lb/>
fashion, that he spake not honestly, but had sold his art <lb/>
for money.</p>
<p>But at the last the prophet spake in great wrath, saying:</p>
<p>"Know, O King, that before many days shall pass, <lb/>
thou shalt pay a life for a life, even one of thine own <lb/>
children, for them with whom thou hast dealt <reg orig="unright-|eously">unrighteously</reg>, <lb/>
shutting up the living with the dead, and <reg orig="keep-|ing">keeping</reg> <lb/>
the dead from them to whom they belong. <reg orig="There-|fore">Therefore</reg> <lb/>
the Furies lie in wait for thee, and thou shalt see <lb/>
whether or no I speak these things for money. For <lb/>
there shall be mourning and lamentation in thine own <lb/>
house; and against thy people shall be stirred up many <lb/>
cities. And now, my child, lead me home, and let this <lb/>
man rage against them that are younger than I."</p>
<p>So the prophet departed, and the old men were sore <lb/>
afraid, and said:</p>
<p>"He hath spoken terrible things, O King; nor ever <lb/>
since these gray hairs were black have we known him <lb/>
say that which was false."</p>
<p>"Even so," said the King, "and I am troubled in <lb/>
heart, and yet am loath to depart from my purpose."</p>
<p>"King Creon," said the old men, "thou needest good <lb/>
counsel."</p>
<pb n="32" entity="b002082275_0057"/>
<p>"What, then, would ye have done?"</p>
<p>"Set free the maiden from the sepulchre, and give <lb/>
this dead man burial."</p>
<p>Then the King cried to his people that they should <lb/>
bring bars wherewith to loosen the doors of the <reg orig="sepul-|chre">sepulchre</reg>, <lb/>
and hastened with them to the place. But coming <lb/>
on their way to the body of Prince Polynices, they took <lb/>
it up, and washed it, and buried that which remained <lb/>
of it, and raised over the ashes a great mound of earth. <lb/>
And this being done, they drew near to the place of the <lb/>
sepulchre; and as they approached, the King heard <lb/>
within a very piteous voice, and knew it for the voice <lb/>
of his son. Then he bade his attendants loose the door <lb/>
with all speed; and when they had loosed it, they <reg orig="be-|held">beheld</reg> <lb/>
within a very piteous sight. For the maiden <lb/>
Antigone had hanged herself by the girdle of linen <lb/>
which she wore, and the young man Prince H&aelig;mon <lb/>
stood with his arms about her dead body, embracing it. <lb/>
And when the King saw him, he cried to him to come <lb/>
forth; but the Prince glared fiercely upon him and <lb/>
answered him not a word, but drew his two-edged sword. <lb/>
Then the King, thinking that his son was minded in his <lb/>
madness to slay him, leapt back, but the Prince drave <lb/>
the sword into his own heart, and fell forward on the <lb/>
earth, still holding the dead maiden in his arms. And <lb/>
when they brought the tidings of these things to Queen <lb/>
Eurydice, the wife of King Creon and mother to the <lb/>
Prince, she could not endure the grief, being thus <lb/>
bereaved of her children, but laid hold of a sword, and <lb/>
slew herselt therewith.</p>
<p>So the house of King Creon was left desolate unto him <lb/>
that day, because he despised the ordinances of the <lb/>
gods.</p>

IPHIGENIA</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">King agamemnon</hi> sat in his tent at Aulis, <lb/>
where the army of the Greeks was gathered <lb/>
together, being about to sail against the great city of <lb/>
Troy. It was now past midnight. But the King slept <lb/>
not, for he was careful and troubled about many things. <lb/>
And he had a lamp before him, and in his hand a tablet <lb/>
of pine wood, whereon he wrote. But he seemed not <lb/>
to remain in the same mind about that which he wrote; <lb/>
for now he would blot out the letters, and then would <lb/>
write them again; and now he fastened the seal upon <lb/>
the tablet and then brake it. And as he did this he <lb/>
wept, and was like to a man distracted. But after a <lb/>
while he called to an old man, his attendant &lpar;the man <lb/>
had been given in time past by Tyndareus to his <reg orig="daugh-|ter">daughter</reg>, <lb/>
Queen Clyt&aelig;mnestra&rpar;, and said:</p>
<p>"Old man, thou knowest how Galchas the soothsayer <lb/>
bade me offer for a sacrifice to Artemis, who is goddess <lb/>
of this place, my daughter Iphigenia, saying that so only <lb/>
should the army have a prosperous voyage from this <lb/>
place to Troy, and should take the city and destroy it; <lb/>
and how when I heard these words I bade Talthybius <lb/>
the herald go throughout the army and bid them depart, <lb/>
every man to his own country, for that I would not do <lb/>
this thing; and how my brother, King Menelaus, per <lb/>
suaded me so that I consented to it. Now, therefore, <lb/>
hearken to this, for what I am about to tell thee three <lb/>
<pb n="34" entity="b002082275_0059"/>
men only know, namely, Calchas, the soothsayer, and <lb/>
Menelaus, and Ulysses, King of Ithaca. I wrote a <lb/>
letter to my wife the Queen, that she should send her <lb/>
daughter to this place, that she might be married to <lb/>
King Achilles; and I magnified the man to her, saying <lb/>
that he would in no wise sail with us unless I would <lb/>
give him my daughter in marriage. But now I have <lb/>
changed my purpose, and have written another letter <lb/>
after this fashion, as I will now set forth to thee: <lb/>
<hi rend="small-caps">'Daughter of Leda, send not thy child to the <lb/>
land of Eub&oelig;a, for I will give her in marriage <lb/>
at another time.'"</hi></p>
<p>"Ay," said the old man, "but how wilt thou deal <lb/>
with King Achilles? Will he not be wroth, hearing <lb/>
that he hath been cheated of his wife?"</p>
<p>"Not so," answered the King, "for we have indeed <lb/>
used his name, but he knoweth nothing of this marriage. <lb/>
And now make haste. Sit not thou down by any <reg orig="foun-|tain">fountain</reg> <lb/>
in the woods, and suffer not thine eyes to sleep. <lb/>
And beware lest the chariot bearing the Queen and her <lb/>
daughter pass thee where the roads divide. And see <lb/>
that thou keep the seal upon this letter unbroken."</p>
<p>So the old man departed with the letter. But scarcely <lb/>
had he left the tent when King Menelaus spied him and <lb/>
laid hands on him, taking the letter and breaking the <lb/>
seal. And the old man cried out:</p>
<p>"Help, my lord; here is one hath taken thy letter!"</p>
<p>Then King Agamemnon came forth from his tent, <lb/>
saying:</p>
<p>"What meaneth this uproar and disputing that I hear?"</p>
<p>But even as he spake there came a messenger, saying: <lb/>
'King Agamemnon, I am come, as thou badest me, <lb/>
with thy daughter Iphigenia. Also her mother, Queen <lb/>
<pb n="35" entity="b002082275_0060"/>
Clyt&aelig;mnestra, is come, bringing with her her little son, <lb/>
Orestes. And now they are resting themselves and <lb/>
their horses by the side of a spring, for indeed the way <lb/>
is long and weary. And all the army is gathered about <lb/>
them. And men question much wherefore they are <lb/>
come, saying, 'Doth the King make a marriage for his <lb/>
daughter; or hath he sent for her, desiring to see her?'"</p>
<p>King Agamemnon was sore dismayed when he knew <lb/>
that the Queen was come, and spake to himself:</p>
<p>"Now what shall I say to my wife? For that she is <lb/>
rightly come to the marriage of her daughter who can <lb/>
deny? But what will she say when she knoweth my <lb/>
purpose? And of the maiden, what shall I say? <reg orig="Un-|happy">Unhappy</reg> <lb/>
maiden whose bridegroom shall be Death! For <lb/>
she will cry to me, 'Wilt thou kill me, my father?' And <lb/>
the little Orestes will wail, not knowing what he doeth, <lb/>
seeing he is but a babe."</p>
<p>And now King Menelaus came, saying that he <reg orig="re-|pented">repented</reg>, <lb/>
"For why should thy child die for me? What <lb/>
hath she to do with war? Let the army be scattered, so <lb/>
that wrong be not done."</p>
<p>Then said King Agamemnon:</p>
<p>"But how shall I escape from this strait? For the <lb/>
whole host will compel me to this deed?"</p>
<p>"Not so," said King Menelaus, "if thou wilt send <lb/>
back the maiden to Argos."</p>
<p>"But what shall that profit," said the King; "for <lb/>
Calchas will cause the matter to be known; or Ulysses, <lb/>
saying that I have failed of my promise; and if I fly to <lb/>
Argos, they will come and destroy my city and lay waste <lb/>
my land. Woe is me! in what a strait am I set! But <lb/>
take care, my brother, that Clyt&aelig;mnestra hear nothing <lb/>
of these things."</p>
<pb n="36" entity="b002082275_0061"/>
<p>When he had ended speaking, the Queen herself came <lb/>
unto the tent, riding in a chariot, having her daughter <lb/>
by her side. And she bade one of the attendants take <lb/>
out with care the caskets which she had brought for her <lb/>
daughter and bade others help her daughter to alight, <lb/>
and herself also, and to a fourth she said that he should <lb/>
take the young Orestes. Then Iphigenia greeted her <lb/>
father, saying:</p>
<p>"Thou hast done well to send for me, my father."</p>
<p>"'T is true and yet not true, my child."</p>
<p>"Thou lookest not well pleased to see me, my <lb/>
father."</p>
<p>"He that is a king and commandeth a host hath <lb/>
many cares."</p>
<p>"Put away thy cares awhile, and give thyself to me."</p>
<p>"I am glad beyond measure to see thee."</p>
<p>"Glad art thou? Then why dost thou weep?"</p>
<p>"I weep because thou must be long time absent from <lb/>
me."</p>
<p>"Perish all these fightings and troubles!"</p>
<p>"They will cause many to perish, and me most <reg orig="miser-|ably">miserably</reg> <lb/>
of all."</p>
<p>"Art thou going a journey from me, my father?"</p>
<p>"Ay, and thou also hast a journey to make."</p>
<p>"Must I make it alone, or with my mother?"</p>
<p>"Alone; neither father nor mother may be with thee."</p>
<p>"Sendest thou me to dwell elsewhere?"</p>
<p>"Hold thy peace: such things are not for maidens to <lb/>
<unclear id="u5">inquire</unclear>."</p>
<p>"Well, my father, order matters with the Phrygians <lb/>
and then make haste to return."</p>
<p>"I must first make a sacrifice to the gods."</p>
<p>"'T is well. The gods should have due honour."</p>
<pb n="37" entity="b002082275_0062"/>
<p>"Ay, and thou wilt stand close to the altar."</p>
<p>"Shall I lead the dances, my father?"</p>
<p>"O my child, how I envy thee, that thou knowest <lb/>
naught! And now go into the tent; but first kiss me, <lb/>
and give me thy hand, for thou shalt be parted from <lb/>
<unclear id="u6">shy</unclear> father for many days."</p>
<p>And when she was gone within, he cried:</p>
<p>"O fair bosom and very lovely cheeks and yellow <lb/>
hair of my child! O city of Priam, what woe thou <lb/>
bringest on me! But I must say no more."</p>
<p>Then he turned to the Queen, and excused himself <lb/>
that he wept when he should rather have rejoiced for the <lb/>
marriage of his daughter. And when the Queen would <lb/>
know of the estate of the bridegroom, he told her that <lb/>
his name was Achilles, and that he was the son of Peleus <lb/>
and Thetis, daughter of Nereus of the sea, and that he <lb/>
dwelt in Phthia. And when she inquired of the time of <lb/>
the marriage, he said that it should be in the same moon, <lb/>
on the first lucky day; and as to the place, that it must <lb/>
be where the bridegroom was sojourning, that is to say, <lb/>
in the camp. "And I," said the King, "will give the <lb/>
maiden to her husband."</p>
<p>"But where," answered the Queen, "is it your <reg orig="pleas-|ure">pleasure</reg> <lb/>
that I should be?"</p>
<p>"Thou must return to Argos, and care for the maidens <lb/>
there."</p>
<p>"Sayest thou that I return? Who then will hold up <lb/>
the torch for the bride?"</p>
<p>"I will do that which is needful. For it is not seemly <lb/>
that thou shouldst be present where the whole army is <lb/>
gathered together."</p>
<p>"Ay, but it is seemly that a mother should give her <lb/>
daughter in marriage."</p>
<pb n="38" entity="b002082275_0063"/>
<p>"But the maidens at home should not be left alone."</p>
<p>"They are well kept."</p>
<p>"Be persuaded, lady."</p>
<p>"Not so; thou shalt order that which is without the <lb/>
house, but I that which is within."</p>
<p>But now came Achilles, to tell the King that the army <lb/>
was growing impatient, saying, that unless they might <lb/>
sail speedily, they would return each man to his home. <lb/>
And when the Queen heard his name &mdash; for he had <lb/>
said to the attendant, "Tell thy master that Achilles, <lb/>
the son of Peleus, would speak with him" &mdash; she came <lb/>
forth from the tent and greeted him, and bade him give <lb/>
her his right hand. And when the young man was <lb/>
abashed she said:</p>
<p>"But why art thou abashed, seeing that thou art <lb/>
about to marry my daughter?"</p>
<p>And he answered:</p>
<p>"What sayest thou, lady? I cannot speak for wonder <lb/>
at thy words."</p>
<p>"Often men are ashamed when they see new friends, <lb/>
and the talk is of marriage."</p>
<p>"But lady, I never was suitor for thy daughter. <lb/>
Nor have the sons of Atreus said aught to me of the <lb/>
matter."</p>
<p>The Queen was beyond measure astonished, and <lb/>
cried:</p>
<p>"Now this is shameful indeed, that I should seek a <lb/>
bridegroom for my daughter in such fashion."</p>
<p>But when Achilles would have departed, to inquire of <lb/>
the King what this thing might mean, the old man that <lb/>
had at the first carried the letter came forth, and bade <lb/>
him stay. And when he had assurance that he would <lb/>
receive no harm for what he should tell them. he <lb/>
<pb n="39" entity="b002082275_0064"/>
unfolded the whole matter. And when the Queen had <lb/>
heard it, she cried to Achilles:</p>
<p>"O son of Thetis of the sea! help me now in this <lb/>
strait, and help this maiden that hath been called thy <lb/>
bride! 'T will be a shame to thee if such wrong be done <lb/>
under thy name; for it is thy name that hath undone us. <lb/>
Nor have I any altar to which I may flee, nor any friend <lb/>
but thee only in this army."</p>
<p>Then Achilles made answer:</p>
<p>"Lady, I learnt from the most righteous of men to <lb/>
be true and honest. Know, then, that thy daughter, <lb/>
seeing that she hath been given, though but in word only, <lb/>
to me, shall not be slain by her father. For if she so die, <lb/>
then shall my name be brought to great dishonour, <lb/>
since through it thou hast been persuaded to come <lb/>
with her to this place. This sword shall see right soon <lb/>
whether anyone will dare to take this maiden from me."</p>
<p>And now King Agamemnon came forth, saying that <lb/>
all things were ready for the marriage, and that they <lb/>
waited for the maiden.</p>
<p>"Tell me," cried the Queen, "dost thou purpose to <lb/>
slay thy daughter and mine?" And when he was silent, <lb/>
not knowing, indeed, what to say, she reproached him <lb/>
with many words, that she had been a loving and <reg orig="faith-|ful">faithful</reg> <lb/>
wife to him, for which he made an ill recompense <lb/>
slaying her child.</p>
<p>And when she had made an end of speaking, the <lb/>
maiden came forth from the tent, holding the young child <lb/>
Orestes in her arms, and cast herself upon her knees <lb/>
before her father, and besought him, saying:</p>
<p>"I would, my father, that I had the voice of Orpheus, <lb/>
who made even the rocks to follow him, that I might <lb/>
persuade thee; but now all that I have I give even these <lb/>
<pb n="40" entity="b002082275_0065"/>
tears. O my father, I am thy child; slay me not <reg orig="be-|fore">before</reg> <lb/>
my time. This light is sweet to look upon. Drive <lb/>
me not from it to the land of darkness. I was the first <lb/>
to call thee father; and the first to whom thou didst <lb/>
say 'my child.' And thou wouldst say to me, 'Some <lb/>
day, my child, I shall see thee a happy wife in the home <lb/>
of a husband.' And I would answer, 'And I will <reg orig="re-|ceive">receive</reg> <lb/>
thee with all love when thou art old, and pay thee <lb/>
back for all the benefits thou hast done unto me.' This <lb/>
I indeed remember, but thou forgettest; for thou art <lb/>
ready to slay me. Do it not, I beseech thee, by Pelops <lb/>
thy grandsire, and Atreus thy father, and this my <lb/>
mother. And thou, O my brother, though thou art <lb/>
but a babe, help me. Weep with me; beseech thy <lb/>
father that he slay not thy sister. O my father, though <lb/>
he be silent, yet, indeed, he beseecheth thee. For his <lb/>
sake, therefore, yea, and for mine own, have pity upon <lb/>
me, and slay me not."</p>
<p>But the King was sore distracted, knowing not what <lb/>
he should say or do, for a terrible necessity was upon <lb/>
him, seeing that the army could not make their journey <lb/>
to Troy unless this deed should first be done. And <lb/>
while he doubted came Achilles, saying that there was a <lb/>
horrible tumult in the camp, the men crying out that <lb/>
the maiden must be sacrificed, and that when he would <lb/>
have stayed them from their purpose, the people had <lb/>
stoned him with stones. Nevertheless, he said that he <lb/>
would fight for the maiden, even to the utmost; and that <lb/>
there were faithful men who would stand with and help <lb/>
him. But when the maiden heard these words, she <lb/>
stood forth and said:</p>
<p>"Hearken, my mother. Be not wroth with my father, <lb/>
for we cannot fight against Fate. Also we must take <lb/>
<pb n="41" entity="b002082275_0066"/>
thought that this young man suffer not, for his help will <lb/>
avail naught, and he himself will perish. Therefore I <lb/>
am resolved to die. All Greece looketh to me. <reg orig="With-|out">Without</reg> <lb/>
me the ships cannot make their voyage, nor the city <lb/>
of Troy be taken. Wherefore I will give myself for the <lb/>
people. Offer me for an offering; and let the Greeks <lb/>
take the city of Troy, for this shall be my memorial for <lb/>
ever."</p>
<p>Then said Achilles:</p>
<p>"Lady, I should count myself most happy if the gods <lb/>
would grant thee to be my wife. For I love thee well, <lb/>
when I see thee how noble thou art. And if thou wilt, <lb/>
I will carry thee to my home. And I doubt not that I <lb/>
shall save thee, though all the men of Greece be against <lb/>
me."</p>
<p>But the maiden answered:</p>
<p>"What I say, I say with full purpose. Nor will I <lb/>
that any man should die for me, but rather will I save <lb/>
this land of Greece."</p>
<p>And Achilles said:</p>
<p>"If this be thy will, lady, I cannot say nay. It is a <lb/>
noble thing that thou doest."</p>
<p>Nor was the maiden turned from her purpose though <lb/>
her mother besought her with many tears. So they that <lb/>
were appointed led her to the grove of Artemis, where <lb/>
there was built an altar, and the whole army of the <lb/>
Greeks gathered about. When the King saw her going <lb/>
to her death he covered his face with his mantle; but <lb/>
she stood by him, and said:</p>
<p>"I give my body with a willing heart to die for my <lb/>
country and for the whole land of Greece. I pray the <lb/>
gods that ye may prosper, and win the victory in this war, <lb/>
and come back safe to your homes. And now let no <lb/>
<pb n="42" entity="b002082275_0067"/>
man touch me, for I will offer my neck to the sword with <lb/>
a good heart."</p>
<p>And all men marvelled to see the maiden of what a <lb/>
good courage she was. Then the herald Talthybius <lb/>
stood in the midst and commanded silence to the people; <lb/>
and Calchas the soothsayer put a garland about her <lb/>
head, and drew a sharp knife from his sheath. And <lb/>
all the army stood regarding the maiden and the priest <lb/>
and the altar.</p>
<p>Then there befell a marvellous thing. Calchas <lb/>
struck with his knife, for the sound of the stroke all <lb/>
men heard, but the maiden was not there. Whither <lb/>
she had gone no one knew; but in her stead there lay a <lb/>
great hind, and all the altar was red with the blood <lb/>
thereof.</p>
<p>And Calchas said:</p>
<p>"See ye this, men of Greece, how the goddess hath <lb/>
provided this offering in the place of the maiden, for she <lb/>
would not that her altar should be defiled with innocent <lb/>
blood. Be of good courage, therefore, and depart every <lb/>
man to his ship, for this day ye shall sail across the sea <lb/>
to the land of Troy."</p>

PAULA</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">In the</hi> city of Rome when its imperial strength <lb/>
had faded, to seek pleasure and to give one's <lb/>
self to display had taken the place of honest work and <lb/>
sober duty. The time of which we speak was the <lb/>
fourth century. Affairs of government had been moved <lb/>
to Constantinople, and the effects of the conduct of <lb/>
great matters in their midst was thus denied the Romans.</p>
<p>The populace, fed for ages on public doles and the <lb/>
terrible gaiety of gladiatorial shows had become <reg orig="thor-|oughly">thoroughly</reg> <lb/>
debased, and unable to work out their own <lb/>
bettering. The persons having riches were likewise <lb/>
degraded by a life of luxury and senseless extravagance. <lb/>
Men of that type aired themselves in lofty chariots, <lb/>
lazily reclining and showing to advantage their <reg orig="care-|fully">carefully</reg> <lb/>
curled hair, robes of silk embroidery and tissue of <lb/>
gold, to excite the admiration and envy of plainer livers. <lb/>
Their horses' harness would be covered with ornaments <lb/>
of gold, their coachmen armed with a golden wand <lb/>
instead of whip, and troups of slaves, parasites and <lb/>
other servitors would dance attendance about them. <lb/>
With such display the poor rich creatures would pass <lb/>
through the streets, pushing out of the way or <reg orig="tramp-|ling">trampling</reg> <lb/>
and crushing to the dust whomsoever they might <lb/>
chance to meet &mdash; very much as some automobilists <lb/>
act to-day. Brutality and senseless show always are <lb/>
hand in glove with each other.</p>
<pb n="44" entity="b002082275_0069"/>
<p>The rich women of Rome well matched such men. <lb/>
Their very shoes crackled under their feet from <lb/>
excess of gold and silver ornament. Their dresses of <lb/>
cloth-of-gold or other expensive stuff were so heavy <lb/>
that the wearers could hardly walk, even with the aid of <lb/>
attendants. Their faces were often painted and their <lb/>
hair dyed and mounted high on the head in monstrous <lb/>
shapes and designs.</p>
<p>Creeping into such a life as we have just been <reg orig="describ-|ing">describing</reg> <lb/>
came the pure and simple precepts of Jesus &mdash; and <lb/>
they doubtless found many a soul athirst and sick with <lb/>
folly and coarse regard for riches. For years the <reg orig="Chris-|tians">Christians</reg> <lb/>
had been persecuted and many of their number <lb/>
gaining the strength that poverty and persecution bring. <lb/>
In opposition to the luxury-loving spirit, also, had risen <lb/>
among a number an austere denial of all pleasure, and <lb/>
such persons sought a solitary life in a cave or other <lb/>
retired spot. The deserts were mined with caverns and <lb/>
holes in the sand in which hermits dwelt, picking up <lb/>
food as best they might, their bones rattling in a skin <lb/>
blackened by exposure &mdash; they were starving, praying <lb/>
and agonising for the salvation of their own souls and <lb/>
for a world sunk in luxury and wickedness.</p>
<p>Now and then one of these hermits would leave his <lb/>
country solitariness and go to some city with a mission <lb/>
of converting vice to virtue. Among these was a man <lb/>
whom we know as Jerome, or Saint Jerome. He was <lb/>
a native of a village on the slope of the Illyrian Alps, <lb/>
and his full name was Eusebius Hieronymus. <reg orig="In-|flamed">Inflamed</reg> <lb/>
with a zeal for doing great works, loving <reg orig="con-|troversy">controversy</reg> <lb/>
and harsh and strong in conflict, Jerome sought <lb/>
Rome after years of study and prayer in the desert. In <lb/>
Rome he came to be a frequenter of a palace on the <lb/>
<pb n="45" entity="b002082275_0070"/>
Aventine in which a number of rich and influential <lb/>
women held meetings for Christian teaching and sought <lb/>
a truer and purer life.</p>
<p>Of all these women we best know Paula. No <lb/>
fine lady of that day was more exquisite, more fastidious, <lb/>
more splendid than she. She could not walk abroad <lb/>
without the support of servants, nor cross the marble <lb/>
floor from one silken couch to another, so heavily was <lb/>
gold interwoven in the tissue of her dresses. Her <lb/>
eldest daughter, Bl&aelig;silla, a widow at twenty, was a <lb/>
Roman exquisite, loving everything soft and luxurious. <lb/>
It was said of her that she spent entire days before her <lb/>
mirror giving herself to personal decoration &mdash; to the <lb/>
tower of curls on her head and the touch of rouge on her <lb/>
cheeks. Paula's second daughter, Paulina, had <reg orig="mar-|ried">married</reg> <lb/>
a young patrician who was Christian.</p>
<p>The third member of the family, a girl of sixteen, was <lb/>
Eustochium, a character strongly contrasting with her <lb/>
beautiful mother and sister. Even in early years she had <lb/>
fixed her choice upon a secluded life and shown herself <lb/>
untouched by the gaudy luxury about her. And to this <lb/>
the following pretty story will bear witness. An aunt of <lb/>
hers was Pr&aelig;textata, wife of a high official of the <reg orig="Em-|peror">Emperor</reg> <lb/>
Julian, and like the Emperor a follower of the <lb/>
old faith in the gods rather than the new faith in the <lb/>
teachings of Jesus. The family of Paula were, <reg orig="how-|ever">however</reg>, <lb/>
as we said, Christian.</p>
<p>This aunt Pr&aelig;textata saw with some impatience and <lb/>
anger what she considered the artificial gravity of her <lb/>
youthful niece, and when she heard that the maid had <lb/>
said she intended never to marry, and purposed to <lb/>
withdraw from the world, she invited Eustochium to <lb/>
her house on a visit. The young vestal donned her <lb/>
<pb n="46" entity="b002082275_0071"/>
brown gown, the habit of humility, and all unsuspicious <lb/>
sought her aunt. She had scarcely found herself within <lb/>
the house, however, before she was seized by favourite <lb/>
maids, who were interested in the plot. They loosed <lb/>
Eustochium's long hair and elaborated it in curls and <lb/>
plaits; they took away her little brown gown and <reg orig="cov-|ered">covered</reg> <lb/>
her with silk and cloth-of-gold; they hung upon <lb/>
her precious ornaments, and finally led her to the mirror <lb/>
to dazzle her eyes with the reflection she would find in <lb/>
the polished surface.</p>
<p>The little maid with the Greek name and pure heart, <lb/>
let them turn her round and round and praise her fresh <lb/>
and youthful beauty. But she was a girl who knew her <lb/>
mind, and was blessed with a natural seriousness. Her <lb/>
aunt's household she permitted to have their pleasure <lb/>
that day. Then again she donned her little brown gown; <lb/>
and wore the habit all her life.</p>
<p>To return to Jerome: he had hardly arrived in Rome <lb/>
when he was made secretary of a council held in that <lb/>
city by ecclesiastics in the year 382. During his stay he <lb/>
dwelt in the house upon the Aventine in which such <lb/>
women as Paula had been meeting. The little <lb/>
community were now giving up their excessive luxuries <lb/>
and were devoting their time and income to good works, <lb/>
to visiting the poor, tending the sick and founding the <lb/>
first hospitals. To the man of the desert the gentle <lb/>
life must have been more agreeable. In this retreat <lb/>
he accomplished the first portion of his great work, <lb/>
the first authoritative translation of the entire Canon <lb/>
of Scripture &mdash; the Vulgate &mdash; so named when the <lb/>
Latin of Jerome was the language of the crowd.</p>
<p>But he did not work alone. Paula and other <lb/>
women of the community helped in the translation <lb/>
<pb n="47" entity="b002082275_0072"/>
They studied with enthusiasm the Scriptures in <lb/>
Hebrew and in Greek; they discussed phrases difficult <lb/>
of understanding, and often held their own opinions <lb/>
against the learned Jerome whose scribes they were <lb/>
willing to be.</p>
<p>Thus began the friendship between Paula and <lb/>
Jerome, which was deepened by the death of Bl&aelig;silla. <lb/>
This eldest daughter of Paula had a serious illness. <lb/>
One night, in a dream or vision, Jesus seemed to appear <lb/>
to her and take her by the hand and say, "Arise, come <lb/>
forth." Waking, she seemed to sit at the table like <lb/>
Mary of Bethany. From that night her whole life was <lb/>
changed. She gathered together her embroidered robes <lb/>
and her jewels and sold them for the poor. Instead of <lb/>
torturing her head with a mitre of curls, she wore a <lb/>
simple veil. A woollen cord, dark linen gown and <lb/>
common shoes replaced the gold embroidered girdle, <lb/>
the glistening silks and the golden-heeled shoes. She <lb/>
slept upon a hard couch. Like others of her family she <lb/>
was finely intelligent, and she became one of the "<reg orig="ap-|prentices">apprentices</reg>" <lb/>
of Jerome, who wrote for her a commentary <lb/>
on the book of Ecclesiastes, "Vanity of Vanities."</p>
<p>Her conversion was enduring, but her health failed. <lb/>
In a few months another attack of fever laid her low. <lb/>
Her funeral was magnificent. Paula, according to <lb/>
Roman custom, accompanied her child's body to the <lb/>
tomb of her ancestors, wild with grief, lamenting, and, <lb/>
at last, fainting, so that she was borne away as <lb/>
one dead.</p>
<p>The people were enraged. They accused Jerome, <lb/>
and other "detestable monks" of killing the young <lb/>
widow with austerities. "Let them," they said, "be <lb/>
stoned and thrown into the Tiber."</p>
<pb n="48" entity="b002082275_0073"/>
<p>For days Paula wept and refused to see her friends <lb/>
Jerome, because he had understood, loved and <reg orig="rever-|enced">reverenced</reg> <lb/>
her child, she consented to admit. Paula <lb/>
listened to his telling her that she "refused nourishment <lb/>
not from love of fasting, but from love of sorrow"; that <lb/>
"the spirit of God descends only upon the humble," <lb/>
and she arose and went forth. Nothing ever interrupted <lb/>
the friendship which from that time made the joy of her <lb/>
life and of Jerome's.</p>
<p>It was in the summer of 385, nearly three years after <lb/>
his coming to Rome, and not a year after the death of <lb/>
Bl&aelig;silla, that Jerome left "Babylon," as he called the <lb/>
tumultuous city. An affectionate company followed <lb/>
him to the seaport. Soon after Paula prepared for her <lb/>
departure, dividing her patrimony among her children. <lb/>
Her daughter, Paulina, was now married to a good and <lb/>
faithful husband, and these two undertook the charge <lb/>
and rearing of their youngest sister and the little <reg orig="Toxo-|tius">Toxotius</reg>, <lb/>
a boy of ten. The grave young Eustochium, her <lb/>
head now covered by the veil of the devotee, clung to <lb/>
her mother's side, a serene figure in the midst of all the <lb/>
misunderstanding and agitation of the parting.</p>
<p>Friends poured forth from the city to accompany them <lb/>
to the port, and all the way along the winding banks of <lb/>
the Tiber they plied Paula with entreaties and reproaches <lb/>
and tears. She made no answer. She was at all times <lb/>
slow to speak, the chronicle tells us. She freighted a <lb/>
ship at the port, Ostia, and retained her self-command <lb/>
until the vessel began to move from the shore where <lb/>
stood her son Toxotius stretching out his hands to her <lb/>
in last appeal, and by his side his sister Rufina, with <lb/>
wistful eyes. Paula's heart was like to burst. She <lb/>
turned her eyes away, unable to bear the sight, and <lb/>
<pb n="49" entity="b002082275_0074"/>
would have fallen but for the support of the firm <reg orig="Eusto-|chium">Eustochium</reg> <lb/>
standing by her mother's side.</p>
<p>The rich Roman lady, luxury-loving, had become a <lb/>
pilgrim. She had, however, according to the <reg orig="interpre-|tation">interpretation</reg> <lb/>
of the Christian spirit of that day, in renouncing <lb/>
her former life and all its belongings, set aside natural <lb/>
ties. Now she was going forth to make herself a home <lb/>
in the solitude of Bethlehem.</p>
<p>Her ship was occupied by her own party alone, and <lb/>
carried much baggage for this emigration for life. It <lb/>
came, hindered by no storms, to Cyprus, where old <lb/>
friends received Paula with honour, and conducted her <lb/>
to visit monks and nuns in their new establishments. <lb/>
She afterward proceeded to Antioch, where Jerome <lb/>
joined the party, and then along the coast of Tyre and <lb/>
Sidon, by Herod's splendid city of C&aelig;sarea and by <lb/>
Joppa rich with memories of the early apostles of their <lb/>
faith. Paula, the pilgrim, was no longer a tottering <lb/>
fine lady, but a strong, animated, interested traveller.</p>
<p>The little company continued on their tour for a year. <lb/>
They first paused, at Jerusalem, and here the tender, <lb/>
enthusiasm of Paula found its fullest expression. She <lb/>
went in a rapture of tears and exaltation from one to <reg orig="an-|other">another</reg> <lb/>
of the sacred sites. She kissed the broken stone <lb/>
which was supposed to have been that rolled against <lb/>
the door of the Holy Sepulchre, and trod with pious awe <lb/>
the path to the cave where the True Cross was found. <lb/>
The legend of Helena's finding the cross was still fresh <lb/>
in those days, and doubts there were none.</p>
<p>The ecstasies and joy of Paula, which found their <lb/>
expression in rapturous prayers and tears, moved all <lb/>
Jerusalem. The city was thronged with pilgrims, and <lb/>
the great Roman lady became their wonder. The <lb/>
<pb n="50" entity="b002082275_0075"/>
crowd followed her from point to point, marvelling at <lb/>
her frank emotion and the warmth of her natural feeling.</p>
<p>From Jerusalem the party set out to journey through <lb/>
the storied deserts of Syria. This was in the year 387. <lb/>
They stopped everywhere to visit those monasteries <lb/>
built in awful passes of the rocks and upon stony wastes <lb/>
that the penance of the indwellers might be the greater. <lb/>
They found shelter with tanned and weather-beaten <lb/>
hermits in their holes and caverns. They poured upon <lb/>
them enthusiastic admiration, and shared with them <lb/>
their Arab bread and clotted milk, and also gave many <lb/>
an alm. Paula fascinated by the desert, would stay <lb/>
there and found a convent. But Jerome prevailed upon <lb/>
her to turn toward Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Thus they came to green Bethlehem, and the calm <lb/>
sweetness of the place and its pleasant fields smote their <lb/>
hearts. Here they determined to settle and build two <lb/>
convents &mdash; Jerome's upon the hill near the western <lb/>
gate and Paula's upon the smiling level below. He is <lb/>
said to have sold all that he had, and all that his brother, <lb/>
his faithful and constant companion, had, to gain money <lb/>
for the expense of his building. Paula, doubtless, had <lb/>
ample means from her former great wealth. Indeed, <lb/>
after her own was builded she had two other convents <lb/>
put up near by, and these were soon filled with devotees.</p>
<p>Also, she built a hospice for the reception of travellers, <lb/>
so that, as she said with tender smile and tears in <lb/>
eyes, "If Joseph and Mary should return to Jerusalem, <lb/>
they might be sure of finding room for them in the inn." <lb/>
This gentle speech shines like a gleam of light upon the <lb/>
little holy city, and shows us the noble, natural kindness <lb/>
of Paula, and how profoundly she had been moved by <lb/>
associations to her most sacred and holy. Every <unclear id="u7">poor</unclear> <lb/>
<pb n="51" entity="b002082275_0076"/>
pilgrim passing her door must to her sympathetic heart <lb/>
have had some semblance to that simple pair who <reg orig="car-|ried">carried</reg> <lb/>
the Light of the World to David's little town among <lb/>
the hills.</p>
<p>Paula now laying aside wholly the luxurious habits of <lb/>
her life, set the example of simple and industrious living <lb/>
by washing floors and cleaning lamps and other household <lb/>
work. But she was far from ceasing her studies.</p>
<p>Jerome every day laboured at his great translation, <lb/>
and Paula and Eustochium copied, compared and <lb/>
criticised his daily labours. A great part of the Vulgate <lb/>
he had completed in Rome. His two friends had, <lb/>
doubtless, shared his studies during their long journey. <lb/>
They now read with him every day a portion of the <lb/>
Scriptures in the original; and it was at their entreaty <lb/>
and with their help that he began the translation of the <lb/>
Psalms. The following is a sympathetic description of <lb/>
the method of this work as it was carried out in the <lb/>
rocky chamber at Bethlehem, or in the convent close by: <lb/>
<q>His two friends charged themselves with the task of collecting <lb/>
all the materials, and this edition, prepared by their care, is that <lb/>
which remains in the Church under Jerome's name. &hellip; It <lb/>
is pleasant to think of the two noble Roman ladies seated before <lb/>
the vast desk upon which were spread the numerous manuscripts, <lb/>
Greek, Hebrew and Latin. &hellip; whilst they examined and <lb/>
compared, reducing to order under their hands, with piety and <lb/>
joy, that Psalter of St. Jerome"</q>
which is still sung to-day.</p>
<p>So on a whole their days passed in fruitful labour. <lb/>
Jerome held a school for boys and young men, in which <lb/>
he taught the classics. But his great work, and the <lb/>
great work of Paula and Eustochium, was the <reg orig="transla-|tion">translation</reg> <lb/>
of the Bible into what was then the speech of the <lb/>
people. For this they spared no pains nor costs. They <lb/>
<pb n="52" entity="b002082275_0077"/>
must have found a quiet happiness above all they had <lb/>
calculated in this work. Their minds and thoughts <lb/>
must have been held by the charm of the noble poetry, <lb/>
by the puzzle of words to be cleared and read aright, by <lb/>
the constant interest of accomplishment that every <lb/>
sunrise brought to them, and brings ever to steadfast <lb/>
workers in these days.</p>
<p>And so they dwelt, the gentle Paula, a woman of <reg orig="cour-|tesy">courtesy</reg>, <lb/>
high spirit, steadfastness and gracious, sprightly <lb/>
humour; Eustochium, the grave young daughter who <lb/>
never left her mother's side, whose gentle shadow is one <lb/>
with her mother's; and Jerome, the greatest writer of <lb/>
his time, the mighty controversialist, a man evidently <lb/>
a well of force and sympathy, the kind friend and fellow <lb/>
worker. Every day the three had conferences as to the <lb/>
most accurate renderings possible, and at all times the <lb/>
greatest respect for the scholarship and acuteness of one <lb/>
another. Amid them was the pleasant stir of <reg orig="independ-|ent">independent</reg> <lb/>
opinion.</p>
<p>In the books that went forth from that seclusion in <lb/>
Bethelehem we find such an inscription as this: <lb/>
<q>You, Paula, and Eustochium, who have studied so deeply the <lb/>
books of the Hebrews, take it, this book of Esther, and test it word <lb/>
by word; you can tell whether anything is added, anything <reg orig="with-|drawn">withdrawn</reg>: <lb/>
and can bear faithful witness whether I have rendered <lb/>
aright in Latin this Hebrew history.</q></p>
<p>Between these zealous workers in Bethlehem and the <lb/>
old Christian friends in Rome letters were constantly <lb/>
passing. And as the years of her absence grew, Paula, <lb/>
in time, heard of the marriage of Toxotius, who, a <lb/>
little boy of ten, had held out begging hands to her as <lb/>
her ship set sail from the port of Rome. Anon came the <lb/>
joyful news that a daughter had been born and named <lb/>
<pb n="53" entity="b002082275_0078"/>
after her grandmother, Paula. The baby's mother, <lb/>
Leta, looking forward with early longings for the child's <lb/>
future, at once wrote to Jerome about the education of <lb/>
the little one.</p>
<p>The great writer's first thought, amidst his joyous <lb/>
congratulations, is the probable conversion of the baby's <lb/>
maternal grandfather, Albinus, a follower of the old gods.</p>
<p>"Albinus is already a candidate for the faith," he <lb/>
writes, "a crowd of sons and grandsons besiege him. I <lb/>
believe, on my part, that if Jupiter himself had such a <lb/>
family he would be converted to Jesus Christ."</p>
<p>Then Jerome gives, with tender detail, the counsels <lb/>
as to education for which Leta had asked. But he <lb/>
adds: <lb/>
<q>"It will be difficult to bring up thy little daughter thus at Rome. <lb/>
Send her to Bethlehem; she will repose in the manger of Jesus. <lb/>
Eustochium wishes for her; trust the little one with her. Let <lb/>
this new Paula be cradled on the bosom of her grandmother. <lb/>
Send her to me; I will carry her on my shoulders, old man as I <lb/>
am. I will make myself a child with her; I will lisp to fit her <lb/>
speech; and, believe me, I shall be prouder of my employment <lb/>
than ever Aristotle was of his" &lsqb;as tutor to Alexander.&rsqb;</q></p>
<p>The invitation was accepted. In a few years the <lb/>
little maiden was indeed sent to Bethlehem, though not <lb/>
till after the death of her grandmother Paula. And it <lb/>
was the child, the younger Paula, who at last closed the <lb/>
eyes of Jerome.</p>
<p>Paula, the grandmother, did not live long after the <lb/>
birth of her namesake. Her last illness was beginning. <lb/>
Eustochium watched her night and day, entrusting to <lb/>
no one else the tender last cares &mdash; sustaining the <reg orig="droop-|ing">drooping</reg> <lb/>
head, warming the cold feet, feeding the weakened <lb/>
body, and making the invalid's bed. If the mother fell <lb/>
asleep for a little while, the daughter would go for <lb/>
<pb n="54" entity="b002082275_0079"/>
prayers to the Manger, close at hand and sanctified by <lb/>
its tender associations of motherhood.</p>
<p>But the precious life was slowly ebbing away. <reg orig="Know-|ing">Knowing</reg> <lb/>
that her end was near, Paula began to repeat with <lb/>
great joy the verses of the Psalms she knew so well: <lb/>
<q>"Lord, I have loved the habitation of Thy house, and the place <lb/>
where Thine honour dwelleth!"; "How amiable are Thy <reg orig="tabernac-|les">tabernacles</reg>, <lb/>
O Lord God of hosts! My soul longeth, yea, fainteth, for the <lb/>
courts of the house of my God."; "Better to be a doorkeeper in <lb/>
the house of my God than to dwell in the tents of wickedness."</q></p>
<p>When she had finished, she began to say these songs <lb/>
of the threshold over again. She did not answer when <lb/>
spoken to, until Jerome came and asked gently why she <lb/>
did not speak and if she suffered. Then she answered <lb/>
in Greek, the language of her father and of her <reg orig="child-|hood">childhood</reg>, <lb/>
that she had no discomfort, but was "beholding in <lb/>
a vision all quiet and tranquil things." "I feel already <lb/>
an infinite peace," she said. And still she continued to <lb/>
murmur at intervals the words of that ancient song of <lb/>
pilgrimage until her voice grew fainter and fainter, and <lb/>
with the sigh of longing for God's presence on her lips <lb/>
she entered it forever.</p>
<p>All Palestine may be said to have assisted at her <lb/>
funeral. A chorus of psalms and lamentations sounded <lb/>
forth in all languages &mdash; Hebrew, Greek, Latin. <reg orig="Her-|mits">Hermits</reg> <lb/>
crept out of their caves, and monks came in throngs <lb/>
from their monasteries to bewail their generous friend, <lb/>
this great Roman lady, this devoted Christian. During <lb/>
her last days bishops from the neighbouring dioceses had <lb/>
gathered round her and her coffin was borne on their <lb/>
heads into the basilica of the Manger.</p>
<p>And there all the poor, the widowed and orphans <lb/>
lamented "their foster-mother," "their mother" and <lb/>
<pb n="55" entity="b002082275_0080"/>
showed the gifts she had given them and the garments <lb/>
she had made for them. Eustochium could with difficulty <lb/>
be prevailed to leave her. She stayed kissing the cold <lb/>
lips, and at last, her grief breaking through the usual <lb/>
calm of her life, throwing her arms about the <reg orig="uncon-|scious">unconscious</reg> <lb/>
form and praying to be buried beside her.</p>
<p>Paula died at fifty-six. She had spent the last eighteen <lb/>
years of her life in Palestine.</p>
<p>Jerome, for the first time in his laborious life, lost his <lb/>
appetite for work. He could do no more. "I have <lb/>
been able to do nothing, not even from the Scriptures, <lb/>
since the death of the holy and gracious Paula," he wrote. <lb/>
"Grief overwhelms me."</p>
<p>Eustochium, with the instinct of true affection, drew <lb/>
him out of this stupor by inducing him to write a memoir <lb/>
of her mother for her. In two sleepless nights he <reg orig="dic-|tated">dictated</reg> <lb/>
it. "He could not write himself. Each time <lb/>
that he took up the tablets his fingers stiffened and the <lb/>
stylus fell from his hand. He could not dwell," he said, <lb/>
"on her great pedigree from the Scipios, the Gracchi, <lb/>
from Agamemnon, nor on her splendid opulence and <lb/>
her palace at Rome. She had preferred Bethlehem to <lb/>
Rome. Her praise was that she died poorer than the <lb/>
poorest she had succoured. At Rome she had not been <lb/>
known beyond Rome. At Bethlehem all Christendom, <lb/>
Roman and barbarian, revered her."</p>
<p>"We weep not her loss; we thank God to have had <lb/>
her. Nay! we have her always, for all live by the spirit <lb/>
of God; and the elect who ascend to Him remain still <lb/>
always in the family of those He loves."</p>
<p>Eustochium quietly took up the guidance of her <lb/>
mother's convents and hospice and gently urged Jerome <lb/>
to resume his work. Writing almost countless letters <lb/>
<pb n="56" entity="b002082275_0081"/>
translating and commenting on the Scriptures he passed <lb/>
still many years, and at last, dying, at his own wish his <lb/>
body was buried in a hollow of the rocks at Bethlehem. <lb/>
To this day, it is said, his name can still be traced <lb/>
graven in the rock.</p>
<p>In the fifteen hundred years that have passed since the <lb/>
death of Paula, the homes of piety and charity established <lb/>
by her strength and love have been swept away. No <lb/>
tradition even of their site is left. But with one storied <lb/>
chamber is connected a warm interest. It is the rocky <lb/>
room, in one of the half caves, half excavations, close to <lb/>
that of the Nativity, and communicating with it by <lb/>
rudely hewn stairs and passages. In this, the legend <lb/>
runs, Jerome established himself while his convent was <lb/>
building. He called it his paradise. Sunlit from above, <lb/>
with prayer and the music of alleluias sounding there <lb/>
night and day, brightened by the glow of the pure <lb/>
affections of Paula and Eustochium and sanctified by <lb/>
their great work, from it flowed rivers of water to <reg orig="re-|fresh">refresh</reg> <lb/>
the earth.</p>

JOAN OF ARC</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">On the</hi> 6th of January, 1412, Jeanne d'Arc, or, as <lb/>
we call her, Joan of Arc, was born at Domremy, <lb/>
a little village on the left bank of the Meuse, on land <lb/>
belonging to the French crown. Her parents, Jacques <lb/>
d'Arc and Isabelle Rom&eacute;e, were simple peasants, "of <lb/>
good life and reputation," who brought up their <lb/>
children to work hard, fear God and honour the <lb/>
saints. Besides Joan, they had four children&mdash;three <lb/>
sons, Jacques, Jean and Pierre, and a daughter, <lb/>
Catherine.</p>
<p>Joan's native valley was fair and fertile. The low hills <lb/>
that bounded it were covered with thick forests, and the <lb/>
rich meadows along the Meuse were gay with flowers, <lb/>
which gave to the chief town in the district its name of <lb/>
Vaucouleurs, <hi rend="italic">Vallis colorum.</hi> Domremy, built on a <lb/>
slope, touched upon those flowery meadows, but over <lb/>
the hill behind it spread an ancient oakwood, the <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italic">Bois <lb/>
Chesnu</hi></foreign> of legend and prophecy. Between the forest and <lb/>
the village rose solitary a great beech, "beautiful as a <lb/>
lily," about which the country people told a thousand <lb/>
<unclear id="u8">tales.</unclear> They called it the "Fairies' Tree," the "Tree of <lb/>
the Ladies," the "Beautiful May." In old times the <lb/>
fairies had danced round it, and under its shadow a noble <lb/>
knight had formerly dared to meet and talk with an <lb/>
elfin lady.</p>
<p>But now, in Joan's time, the presence of the fairies was <lb/>
<pb n="58" entity="b002082275_0083"/>
less certain, for the priest of Domremy came once a year <lb/>
to say mass under the tree, and exorcise it and a spring <lb/>
that bubbled up close by. On festival days the young <lb/>
villagers hung it with garlands, danced and played round <lb/>
it, and rested under its boughs to eat certain cakes which <lb/>
their mothers had made for them. During her <reg orig="child-|hood">childhood</reg>, <lb/>
Joan brought her cakes and garlands like the rest, <lb/>
danced with them, and sang more than she danced; but <lb/>
as she grew older, she would steal away and carry her <lb/>
flowers to the neighbouring chapel of Our Lady of <reg orig="Dom-|remy">Domremy</reg>.</p>
<p>Her early years were, considering the times, quiet and <lb/>
peaceful. With the war raging between English and <lb/>
French and their allies, to its west and north, Domremy <lb/>
had comparatively little to do. News of English <reg orig="suc-|cesses">successes</reg>, <lb/>
of French defeats, and the sorrows of the French <lb/>
King, were brought by fugitives from the war, by <reg orig="travel-|ling">travelling</reg> <lb/>
monks, and other wanderers. Joan helped to <reg orig="re-|ceive">receive</reg> <lb/>
those wayfarers, waited on them, gave up her own <lb/>
bed to them sometimes; and what they told of the woes <lb/>
of France she heard with intense sympathy, and <reg orig="pon-|dered">pondered</reg> <lb/>
in her heart.</p>
<p>Her bringing up fitted her for the tender fulfilling of <lb/>
all womanly duties. Unlike most girls of her class, she <lb/>
had few outdoor tasks, but spent most of her time at <lb/>
her mother's side, doing the work of the house, learning <lb/>
to sew and spin, to repeat the Belief, and the legends of <lb/>
the saints, Her work done, her dearest pleasure was to <lb/>
go to the village church, which was close to her father's <lb/>
cottage, and there kneel in prayer, gaze on the pictured <lb/>
angels, or listen to the bells calling the faithful to <reg orig="wor-|ship">worship</reg>: <lb/>
she had always a peculiar delight in the sound of <lb/>
church bells. She fasted regularly, and went often to <lb/>
<pb n="59" entity="b002082275_0084"/>
confession; so often, that her young companions were <lb/>
inclined to jest at her devotion, and even her chosen <lb/>
friends, Haumette and Mengette, half-scolded her for <lb/>
being over-religious. But her faith bore sound fruit. <lb/>
The little money she got she gave in alms. She nursed <lb/>
the sick, she was gentle to the young and weak, obedient <lb/>
to her parents, kind to all. "There was no one like her <lb/>
in the village," said her priest. "She was a good girl," <lb/>
testified an old peasant, "such a daughter as I would <lb/>
gladly have had." A good girl, indeed: they were pure <lb/>
and helpful hands that for a while held the fate of <lb/>
France.</p>
<p>There was a prophecy current during that unhappy <lb/>
time &mdash; an old prophecy of Merlin &mdash; which the <reg orig="suffer-|ing">suffering</reg> <lb/>
people had taken and applied to their own day and <lb/>
their own need. "The kingdom, lost by a woman, was <lb/>
to be saved by a woman." The woman who had lost it <lb/>
was Isabeau, of Bavaria, the wicked queen, the false <lb/>
wife of Charles VI, the unnatural mother. Who was <lb/>
she that should save it? In the east of France it was <lb/>
said that the deliverer would be a maid from the marshes <lb/>
of Lorraine.</p>
<p>Joan knew the ancient prophecy, and in her young <lb/>
mind it became blended with legends of the saints, with <lb/>
stories of Bible heroines, with her own ardent faith and <lb/>
high aspirations. She loved more and more to be alone. <lb/>
Night and day the wonderful child brooded on the <reg orig="sor-|rows">sorrows</reg> <lb/>
of France. She sent out her vague hopes and <lb/>
yearnings in tears and prayers, and passionate thoughts <lb/>
that were prayers, and they all came back to her with <lb/>
form and sound, in the visions and voices that were <lb/>
henceforth to be the rulers of her life.</p>
<p>They came first when she was thirteen years old. On <lb/>
<pb n="60" entity="b002082275_0085"/>
a summer's day, at noon, she was in her father's garden, <lb/>
when suddenly by the church there appeared a great <lb/>
light, and out of the light a voice spoke to her, "Joan, <lb/>
be a good child; go often to church." She was <reg orig="fright-|ened">frightened</reg> <lb/>
then, but both voice and brightness came again <lb/>
and again, and grew dear and familiar. Noble shapes <lb/>
appeared in the glory. St. Michael showed himself to <lb/>
her; St. Catherine and St. Margaret bent over her their <lb/>
radiant heads, bidding her "be good; trust in God." <lb/>
They told her of "the sorrow there was in the kingdom <lb/>
of France," and warned her that one day it would be her <lb/>
mission to go and carry help to the King.</p>
<p>While to outward eyes she lived as usual, she had a <lb/>
life apart, given to God and her saints. She vowed her <lb/>
virginity to Heaven, but of her vow and the visions that <lb/>
had led her to it she told no one, not even the priest. Her <lb/>
meditations, her prayers and unearthly friendships, <lb/>
made of her no sickly dreamer nor hot brained fanatic. <lb/>
She grew up strong, tall and handsome, with a healthy <lb/>
mind in her healthy body.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the dangers of France darkened and <lb/>
thickened. The war was pushing southward; the <reg orig="Eng-|lish">English</reg> <lb/>
leader, Salisbury, was on his way to Orleans; the <lb/>
French King, Charles, poor, indolent, ill-advised, was <lb/>
deliberating whether he should retreat into Dauphin&egrave;, <lb/>
or Spain, or Scotland.</p>
<p>Joan's voices grew more frequent and more <reg orig="ur-|gent">urgent</reg>. <lb/>
Their word now was always, "Go &mdash; go into <lb/>
France!" At last they had told her the way: "Go <lb/>
to Vaucouleurs, to Robert de Baudricourt, the <reg orig="gov-|ernor">governor</reg>; <lb/>
he will give you men-at-arms, and send you to <lb/>
the King."</p>
<p>It was now that Joan's trial began. While her <lb/>
<pb n="61" entity="b002082275_0086"/>
beautiful visitors had spoken vaguely of some "<reg orig="deliver-|ance">deliverance</reg>" <lb/>
she was to bring about in the future, she had <lb/>
listened with trembling joy. But now they had plainly <lb/>
shown her the distasteful first step, and for a moment <lb/>
she shrank from taking it. How could a peasant brave <lb/>
the governor of Vaucouleurs? How was a modest girl <lb/>
to venture among rude men-at-arms? How could a <lb/>
dutiful child leave her parents and her home?</p>
<p>"Alas!" she pleaded, "I am a poor girl; I know <lb/>
neither how to ride nor how to fight." She had a short, <lb/>
hard struggle with her own weakness, but the voices did <lb/>
not alter, and she set herself to do their bidding.</p>
<p>Her uncle, Durant Laxart, with whom she evidently <lb/>
was a favourite, lived at a village near Vaucouleurs, and <lb/>
in May, 1428, she went to his house for a visit. After a <lb/>
few days she confided to him something of her plans, <lb/>
reminding him of the old prophecy of Merlin, but never <lb/>
speaking of her visions. With much difficulty she <reg orig="pre-|vailed">prevailed</reg> <lb/>
on him to help her. He went with her to <reg orig="Vau-|couleurs">Vaucouleurs</reg>, <lb/>
and before the governor, to whom she made <lb/>
known her errand.</p>
<p>"Send and tell the Dauphin," she said, "to wait and <lb/>
not offer battle to his enemies, because God will give <lb/>
him help before mid-Lent. The kingdom belongs not <lb/>
to the Dauphin, but to my Lord; but my Lord wills that <lb/>
the Dauphin shall be king, and hold it in trust. In <lb/>
spite of his enemies he shall be king, and I myself shall <lb/>
lead him to be crowned."</p>
<p>"And who is your Lord?" demanded Baudricourt. <lb/>
She answered, "The King of Heaven."</p>
<p>The governor, a rough and practical soldier, laugher at <lb/>
the young peasant in her coarse red dress, and bade her <lb/>
uncle chastise her well, and take her home to her father.</p>
<pb n="62" entity="b002082275_0087"/>
<p>She returned to Domremy with her heart more than ever <lb/>
fixed on the work she had before her. Now and again <lb/>
she let fall words that revealed enough to make her <lb/>
parents anxious and fearful. Her father dreamed that <lb/>
she had gone away with the soldiers. "If I thought <lb/>
such a thing could happen," he said to her brothers, "I <lb/>
would bid you drown her, and if you refused, I would <lb/>
drown her myself." But she was of a marriageable <lb/>
age; why should she not marry, stay at home, and bring <lb/>
up children, like other women? A lover came forward, <lb/>
a bold one, who, when she rejected him, summoned her <lb/>
before the court at Toul, declaring that she had promised <lb/>
to be his wife. But she went before the judges, spoke <lb/>
out bravely, and defeated her persevering suitor.</p>
<p>As the months passed, her longing increased to be <lb/>
gone and do her voices' bidding. Once more she <lb/>
obtained her uncle's help. His wife was ill, and he <lb/>
came to Domremy and got leave for Joan to go back <lb/>
with him and nurse her. She went, keeping secret the <lb/>
real end of her journey. "If I had had a hundred <lb/>
fathers and a hundred mothers," she said later, "and <lb/>
if I had been a king's daughter, I should have gone." <lb/>
She took leave of her companion Mengette, but to <lb/>
Haumette, her dearer friend, she would not trust <reg orig="her-|self">herself</reg> <lb/>
to say farewell. Her uncle took her to <reg orig="Vaucou-|leurs">Vaucouleurs</reg>, <lb/>
and gave her in charge of a wheelwright's wife, <lb/>
Catherine Royer, with whom she lived for some weeks. <lb/>
She went constantly to church, she helped her hostess in <lb/>
the house, and was gentle and obedient. At the same <lb/>
time, she spoke frankly of her mission to any who chose <lb/>
to hear.</p>
<p>She again went to the governor, who received her no <lb/>
better than before. But she was not cast down.</p>
<pb n="63" entity="b002082275_0088"/>
<p>"I must go to the Dauphin," she said, "though I <lb/>
should go on my knees."</p>
<p>Many people went to see her, among others a brave <lb/>
gentleman of Metz, Jean de Novelonpont.</p>
<p>"What are you doing here, my child?" he asked her, <lb/>
jestingly. "Shall the King be driven out of France, and <lb/>
must we all turn English?"</p>
<p>"I am come to this royal city," she answered, "to bid <lb/>
Robert de Baudricourt take or send me to the King, <lb/>
but he does not heed my words; and yet before <reg orig="mid-|Lent">mid-Lent</reg> <lb/>
I must be before the King, though I should wear <lb/>
away my legs to the knees. For no one else in the <lb/>
world, neither kings, nor dukes, can recover the <reg orig="king-|dom">kingdom</reg> <lb/>
of France, and there is no help but in me. And, <lb/>
indeed, I would rather spin with my poor mother, for <lb/>
this is not my calling; but I must go and do it, for it is <lb/>
my Lord's will."</p>
<p>Like Baudricourt, the knight asked her:</p>
<p>"Who is your lord?"</p>
<p>And she answered, "He is God."</p>
<p>But, unlike Baudricourt, he was touched by her <lb/>
words. In the old feudal fashion, he laid his hands <lb/>
within hers and vowed that, by God's help, he would <lb/>
take her to the King. Another worthy gentleman, <lb/>
Bertrand de Poulengy, gave a like promise.</p>
<p>Baudricourt was now forced to listen to Joan. The <lb/>
people of Vaucouleurs believed in her with the ready <lb/>
faith of that time, and she had at least two of his own <lb/>
class to take her part. But those voices of hers, were <lb/>
they of God or of the Devil? Was she witch or saint? <lb/>
The governor, like many another good soldier, had <lb/>
some weakness of superstition. He went to see her, <lb/>
taking with him a priest, who began to exorcise her. <lb/>
<pb n="64" entity="b002082275_0089"/>
bidding her avaunt if she were of the Evil One. Joan <lb/>
approached the priest and knelt before him, honouring <lb/>
not him, but his office; for, as she said afterwards, he <lb/>
had not done well; he should have known that no evil <lb/>
spirit spoke by her.</p>
<p>While she was waiting Baudricourt's pleasure, the <lb/>
Duke of Lorraine, who was ill at Nancy, heard of her, <lb/>
and, hoping for the revelation of some cure, desired to <lb/>
see her. He sent her a safe-conduct, and she went to <lb/>
Nancy under care of her uncle. But she knew only <lb/>
what her voices taught, and she had no power to cure <lb/>
any ills but those of France. This she told the Duke <lb/>
promising him her prayers, and begging him to aid in <lb/>
her enterprise. He sent her back honourably, but did <lb/>
not pledge himself to the royal cause.</p>
<p>The people of Vaucouleurs came forward to help <lb/>
Joan. They gave her a horse, and the dress and <reg orig="equip-|ment">equipment</reg> <lb/>
of a soldier; for as she was to travel with men, she <lb/>
wisely chose to wear man's attire. Baudricourt still <lb/>
doubted and delayed. The people she was sojourning <lb/>
with pitied her anxiety. On the day of the battle of <lb/>
Rouvray she went to the governor.</p>
<p>"In God's name," she said, "you are too slow about <lb/>
sending me. To-day the Dauphin has suffered great <lb/>
loss near Orleans, and he is in danger of yet greater if <lb/>
you do not send me to him soon."</p>
<p>At last he yielded to her urgency. He gave her a <lb/>
sword and a letter to the King, and let her prepare to <lb/>
depart. Bertrand de Poulengy, Jean de Novelonpont, <lb/>
and four armed men of lesser rank were to accompany <lb/>
her. She did not see her parents to bid them farewell, <lb/>
but she sent them a letter, entreating them to pardon <lb/>
her. She spoke cheerily to those who were afraid for <lb/>
<pb n="65" entity="b002082275_0090"/>
her safety. God and "her brothers of Paradise" would <lb/>
guard her and her little escort on their dangerous <lb/>
journey.</p>
<p>On February 23, 1429, they set out, Baudricourt <lb/>
bidding her "Go, come of it what may."</p>
<p>Her most timid well-wisher could hardly have <reg orig="exag-|gerated">exaggerated</reg> <lb/>
the perils of the journey. More than half of it <lb/>
was through the enemy's country, where there was <reg orig="con-|tinual">continual</reg> <lb/>
risk of being stopped and questioned. The <lb/>
rivers, swollen by the winter rains, were unfordable; <lb/>
therefore the travellers had to cross over bridges in full <lb/>
sight of fortified towns.</p>
<p>On the eleventh day of their journey the Maid and <lb/>
her party reached St. Catherine de Fierbois, near Chinon, <lb/>
where they rested, and Joan heard three masses. She <lb/>
sent a letter to Charles requesting an audience, and <reg orig="tell-|ing">telling</reg> <lb/>
him she had come a hundred and fifty leagues to <lb/>
help him.</p>
<p>An interview with Charles was no such simple affair <lb/>
as she had fancied. Between her and him were doubts, <lb/>
jealousies, intrigues. But her friends prevailed, and <lb/>
after two days' waiting she was admitted to the castle. <lb/>
As she was passing through the gate, a man-at-arms <lb/>
called out,</p>
<p>"What, is that the Maid?" and added a coarse jest <lb/>
and an oath.</p>
<p>Joan turned and looked gravely at him.</p>
<p>"Alas!" she said, "you blaspheme God, and you are <lb/>
so near your death!" Within an hour the man was <lb/>
drowned by accident, and those words of hers were <lb/>
repeated far and wide as a proof of her prophetic power.</p>
<p>The Count of Vend&ocirc;me led her into the royal presence. <lb/>
She entered meekly, but undismayed; in her visions she <lb/>
<pb n="66" entity="b002082275_0091"/>
had seen finer company than any earthly court could <lb/>
show her. Charles stood among the crowd of nobles, <lb/>
and when she knelt before him he pointed to a <reg orig="richly-|dressed">richly-dressed</reg> <lb/>
lord, saying:</p>
<p>"That is the King, not I."</p>
<p>But she knew the King, probably from descriptions <lb/>
she had heard of him, and answered:</p>
<p>"In God's name, gracious Prince, you are he, and <lb/>
none other." She then repeated to him the words which, <lb/>
like a charm, had brought her so far and overcome so <lb/>
much; "I am Joan the Maid, sent by God to save <lb/>
France," and she asked him for troops, that she might <lb/>
go and raise the siege of Orleans.</p>
<p>Presently the Duke of Alen&ccedil;on came in, and the King <lb/>
having told her who he was, she bade him welcome.</p>
<p>"The more there are of the blood-royal of France," <lb/>
she said, "the better it will be."</p>
<p>Alen&ccedil;on, who had lately returned from a three years' <lb/>
captivity in England, and was still paying a ruinous <lb/>
ransom, sympathised with the girl-champion, and was <lb/>
inclined to believe in her.</p>
<p>The King and his advisers went cautiously to work.</p>
<p>They sent two monks to Domremy to inquire into <lb/>
Joan's character and past life. They called her now and <lb/>
again to Court, where statesmen and churchmen <reg orig="ques-|tioned">questioned</reg> <lb/>
her closely. Meanwhile, she was honourably <lb/>
treated. She was given to the charge of Bellier, the <lb/>
King's lieutenant, whose wife was a lady of virtue and <lb/>
piety, and many distinguished persons visited her at the <lb/>
castle where she was lodged. One day she rode with <lb/>
the lance before the King, and acquitted herself so well <lb/>
that the Duke of Alen&ccedil;on rewarded her with the gift <lb/>
of a beautiful horse. Could she have at all forgotten <lb/>
<pb n="67" entity="b002082275_0092"/>
her mission, the time would have passed pleasantly; <lb/>
as it was, she wearied for action.</p>
<p>At last she sought the King, and said to him:</p>
<p>"Gracious Dauphin" &mdash; until Charles was anointed <lb/>
at Reims with the sacred oil, he was no real king in her <lb/>
eyes &mdash; "Gracious Dauphin, why will you not believe <lb/>
me? I tell you, God has pity on you, your kingdom <lb/>
and people."</p>
<p>To satisfy all doubts about Joan, it was settled that <lb/>
she should be taken to Poitiers, where the Parliament <lb/>
was assembled, and be there questioned by a royal <lb/>
commission.</p>
<p>"In God's name, let us go," she said; "I shall have <lb/>
hard work, but my Lord will help me."</p>
<p>She was lodged in the house of the advocate-general <lb/>
to the Parliament, and committed to his wife's care. <lb/>
The Archbishop of Reims called together churchmen <lb/>
and learned doctors. The Commissioners met, and, <lb/>
having called Joan, showed her "by good and fair <reg orig="argu-|ments">arguments</reg>" <lb/>
that she was unworthy of belief. They reasoned <lb/>
with her for more than two hours, and she answered <lb/>
them so well that they were amazed. In spite of their <lb/>
expressed distrust, she spoke to them freely and fully, <lb/>
told how her voices had bidden her go into France, how <lb/>
she had wept at their command and yet obeyed it, how she <lb/>
had come safely, because she was doing the will of God.</p>
<p>"You require an army," said one, "saying it is God's <lb/>
will that the English shall quit France. If that be so, <lb/>
there is no need for men-at-arms, because God can drive <lb/>
them away by His pleasure."</p>
<p>"The men-at-arms shall fight," she answered, "and <lb/>
God shall give the victory"; and the monk confessed <lb/>
that she had answered well.</p>
<pb n="68" entity="b002082275_0093"/>
<p>When the examination had dragged on for three weeks <lb/>
two of the doctors came one day to question her, <reg orig="bring-|ing">bringing</reg> <lb/>
with them the King's equerry, whom she had known <lb/>
at Chinon, She clapped him, comrade-like, on the <lb/>
shoulder, exclaiming:</p>
<p>"Would that I had many more men of as good will as <lb/>
you!" Then turning to the doctors, she said, "I believe <lb/>
you are come to catechise me. Listen! &mdash;I know neither <lb/>
A nor B, but there is more in God's books than in yours. <lb/>
He has sent me to save Orleans and crown the King."</p>
<p>She demanded paper and ink. "Write what I tell <lb/>
you!" she said, and dictated to the amazed scholars the <lb/>
famous letter which soon after was sent to the English.</p>
<p>The grave and stern commissioners were won by the <lb/>
young peasant. None of them bore her any grudge for <lb/>
the occasional sharpness of her replies. Many of them <lb/>
believed firmly that she was inspired, and quoted the <lb/>
old prophecy of Merlin, who had foretold the coming <lb/>
of a maid who should deliver France. All of them <lb/>
trusted in her good faith, and appreciated more or less <lb/>
the influence she would have over the people. They <lb/>
advised, almost commanded, Charles to employ her. <lb/>
Her life, they said, has been carefully inquired into; for <lb/>
six weeks she has been kept near the King; persons of <lb/>
all ranks, men and women, have seen and talked with <lb/>
her, and have found in her only "goodness, humility, <lb/>
chastity, devotion, seemliness and simplicity." She <lb/>
has promised to show her sign before Orleans: let the <lb/>
King send her there, for to reject her would be to reject <lb/>
the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Besides her learned judges, she had others, whom <lb/>
had she been an impostor, she would have found hard <lb/>
to deceive. Keen women's eyes had been set to watch <lb/>
<pb n="69" entity="b002082275_0094"/>
her and had seen no fault in her. The ladies who came <lb/>
to see the warrior-damsel were amazed to find her a <lb/>
mere girl, "very simple, and speaking little." Her <lb/>
goodness and innocence moved them to tears. She <lb/>
prayed them to pardon her for the man's attire she wore; <lb/>
but in that lawless day the most modest women must <lb/>
have well understood that such a dress was fittest and <lb/>
safest for her who had to live among men.</p>
<p>Towards the end of April she was sent to Tours, <lb/>
where a military staff was appointed her. Her brothers, <lb/>
Jean and Pierre, who had followed her, were included <lb/>
in her retinue. A suit of beautiful armour was made <lb/>
for her. She was provided with a banner after her own <lb/>
device &mdash; white, embroidered with lilies: on one side of <lb/>
it, a picture of God enthroned on clouds and holding a <lb/>
globe in His hand; on the other, the shield of France, <lb/>
supported by two angels. She had also a pennon, <lb/>
whereon was represented the Annunciation. The King <lb/>
would have given her a sword, but her voices, she said, <lb/>
had told her of the only one she might use, an ancient <lb/>
weapon with five crosses on its blade, which was lying <lb/>
buried behind the altar in the church of St. Catherine de <lb/>
Fierbois. A messenger was sent, and in the place she <lb/>
had told of was found an old rusty sword such as she had <lb/>
described. After being polished, it was brought to her <lb/>
with two rich scabbards, one of crimson velvet, the other <lb/>
of cloth-of-gold; but the practical Maid got herself yet <lb/>
another of strong leather for daily wear.</p>
<p>Joan, being accepted, the National party made rapid <lb/>
preparations for the relief of Orleans.</p>
<p>Her first care was that the army given her by God <lb/>
should be worthy of His favour. For the priests <reg orig="at-|tached">attached</reg> <lb/>
to it, she had a banner made with a picture of <lb/>
<pb n="70" entity="b002082275_0095"/>
the Crucifixion, beneath which they said mass and sang <lb/>
hymns to the Virgin morning and evening.</p>
<p>On Thursday, April 28th, the relieving army set out <lb/>
from Blois, the priests going before and singing the <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Veni Creator</hi> round their banner of the Cross. Joan <lb/>
wished to march along the north bank of the Loire, and <lb/>
through the line of English forts; her voices, she said, <lb/>
had told her that the convoy would pass them without <lb/>
hurt. But the captains, who had little faith in her <lb/>
revelations, preferred keeping the river between <reg orig="them-|selves">themselves</reg> <lb/>
and the chief bastiles of the enemy. They had <lb/>
orders, however, to obey the Maid, so, to avoid <reg orig="contra-|dicting">contradicting</reg> <lb/>
her, they misled her as to the position of Orleans; <lb/>
crossing the bridge at Blois, they advanced by the south <lb/>
bank of the stream. When night came, the army <reg orig="en-|camped">encamped</reg> <lb/>
on the plain, and Joan, who lay down in her <lb/>
armour, arose bruised and weary for the next day's march. <lb/>
But all her fatigue was forgotten when she saw how <lb/>
<unclear id="u9">she</unclear> had been deceived.</p>
<p>Dunois, with a following of knights and citizens, <lb/>
came up the river to welcome the convoy. When he <lb/>
approached Joan, she asked him:</p>
<p>"Are you the bastard of Orleans?"</p>
<p>"Yes," he replied, "and I am glad of your coming."</p>
<p>"And did you advise that I should be brought by this <lb/>
side of the river, and not straight to the English?"</p>
<p>He answered that it was so, he and the council <reg orig="hav-|ing">having</reg> <lb/>
judged it safest.</p>
<p>"In God's name," she said, "my Lord's counsel is <lb/>
safer and wiser than yours. You thought to deceive me, <lb/>
but you have deceived yourselves, for I bring you the <lb/>
best help that ever knight or city had; for it is God's <lb/>
help, not sent for love of me but by God's pleasure."</p>
<pb n="71" entity="b002082275_0096"/>
<p>At eight that evening she entered Orleans, riding a <lb/>
white horse, her standard carried before her. The <lb/>
people thronged to meet her, wild with joy, "as if she <lb/>
had been an angel of God." "They felt comforted and, <lb/>
as it were, dis-besieged by the divine virtue there was <lb/>
said to be in that simple Maid." They crowded so upon <lb/>
her, that one of their torches set fire to the border of her <lb/>
standard, and when she bent forward and crushed out <lb/>
the flame, the little brave action seemed a miracle to <lb/>
the excited multitude. After returning thanks to God <lb/>
in the cathedral, she rode to the house of Jacques <lb/>
Boucher, treasurer to the Duke of Orleans, and was <lb/>
hospitably received by his wife and his young daughter <lb/>
Charlotte, whom she took to share her chamber during <lb/>
her stay in the city.</p>
<p>The next Sunday, May 1st, Dunois went to fetch the <lb/>
army from Blois. The Maid rode with him a little way, <lb/>
and he and his following passed unmolested by the <lb/>
English forts. The days of his absence were spent by <lb/>
Joan in making friends with the citizens, in attending <lb/>
mass and riding out to reconnoitre the enemy's <reg orig="siege-|works">siege-works</reg>. <lb/>
The enthusiastic people followed her <reg orig="every-|where">everywhere</reg>, <lb/>
fearing nothing so long as they were near her. <lb/>
On Tuesday some reinforcements arrived, and news <lb/>
came that the army was on its way.</p>
<p>This time they took the northern side of the river, and <lb/>
on May 4th Joan went a league out of the city to meet <lb/>
them. The whole army passed the line of forts and <reg orig="en-|tered">entered</reg> <lb/>
Orleans. The besiegers made no sign, and it is <lb/>
not wonderful that the English soldiers, seeing that <lb/>
strange apathy of their leaders, believed Joan to be a <lb/>
witch, whose arts it would be useless to resist.</p>
<p>The same day, towards evening she lay down to rest <lb/>
<pb n="72" entity="b002082275_0097"/>
but suddenly she started up and called her squire, saying <lb/>
"My counsel tells me to go against the English." While <lb/>
he was arming her, she heard voices in the street shouting <lb/>
that the French were suffering loss. She rushed out, <lb/>
and meeting her page on the way:</p>
<p>"Ah, graceless boy!" she exclaimed, "you never told <lb/>
me the blood of France was being spilt."</p>
<p>Her hostess finished arming her, then she sprang <lb/>
upon her horse, took her standard which the page <lb/>
handed her out of a window, and galloped to the eastern <lb/>
gate, her horse's hoofs striking sparks as she passed.</p>
<p>For the first time she now saw real war, and her <reg orig="cour-|age">courage</reg> <lb/>
did not fail. Standing at the edge of the fosse, she <lb/>
urged her men on to the assault. This first success, <lb/>
moderate in itself, was of immense value to the National <lb/>
party, for it restored to the French that faith in <reg orig="them-|selves">themselves</reg> <lb/>
of which the long series of their defeats had <lb/>
almost deprived them. And their reverse had as great <lb/>
an effect upon the English. Their failure appeared to <lb/>
them out of the natural course of events, a wicked <lb/>
miracle, a thing brought about by sorcery. The brave <lb/>
yeomen of Henry V were learning to fear.</p>
<p>On Friday, May 6th, Joan and about 3,000 men <lb/>
crossed to an island, in the Loire, passed from it to the <lb/>
shore by an extempore bridge of two boats, and planted <lb/>
her standard before the rampart of the Augustins. But <lb/>
her troops had not all crossed from Orleans, and those <lb/>
who were with her, seeing that the English were coming <lb/>
to reinforce their fellows, were seized with fear, and <lb/>
hurried back to the boats. The garrison rushed out <lb/>
and pursued the fugitives with jeers and insults. The <lb/>
defeat of the French appeared certain, but Joan, who <lb/>
had been trying to cover the retreat, faced round, and <lb/>
<pb n="73" entity="b002082275_0098"/>
with a small brave company charged the pursuers. The <lb/>
panic was on their side now. They saw the Witch of <lb/>
France riding down upon them, her charmed standard <lb/>
flying, her eyes flashing with terrible wrath, and they <lb/>
turned and fled before her. Once more she planted her <lb/>
flag before the rampart, and this time she was well <reg orig="sup-|ported">supported</reg>. <lb/>
The bastile was taken after an obstinate <reg orig="de-|fence">defence</reg>, <lb/>
and to prevent riot and pillage she ordered it to <lb/>
be set on fire.</p>
<p>She would gladly have stayed with her soldiers who <lb/>
were left that night to be ready for the next day's assault, <lb/>
but the chiefs, seeing that she was very weary, persuaded <lb/>
her to return with them into Orleans. They had <reg orig="an-|other">another</reg> <lb/>
reason for parting her from the troops. While <lb/>
she was resting they held a council, and agreed not to <lb/>
renew the attack on the morrow, but recall the troops <lb/>
into the city, which was now well victualled, and there <lb/>
await reinforcements. A knight was sent to tell her <lb/>
of their over-cautious decision:</p>
<p>"God had already done much to help them; now they <lb/>
would wait." Wait! &mdash; how Joan must have hated that <lb/>
word! "You have been in your council," she said, <lb/>
"and I have been in mine. Be sure that God's counsel <lb/>
will hold good and come to pass, and that all other <lb/>
counsel shall perish."</p>
<p>Then she turned to Pasquerel, who was standing near.</p>
<p>"Rise early to-morrow," she said, "and keep near <lb/>
me all day, for I shall have much to do, and blood shall <lb/>
flow above my breast."</p>
<p>She rose at dawn, and after hearing mass, started <lb/>
for the assault. Her host urged her to take food <lb/>
before going; a shad was being got ready, he told <lb/>
her.</p>
<pb n="74" entity="b002082275_0099"/>
<p>"Keep it till evening," she said, gaily," "I will come <lb/>
back over the bridge."</p>
<p>If the French fought for the deliverance of Orleans <lb/>
and the kingdom, the English were defending their <reg orig="an-|cient">ancient</reg> <lb/>
glory and their own lives; the fort once taken, <lb/>
there would be small chance of escape for any of its <reg orig="gar-|rison">garrison</reg>. <lb/>
Under cannon-fire and through flights of <lb/>
arrows, the assailants leaped into the fosse and swarmed <lb/>
up the escarpment, "as if they believed themselves <lb/>
immortal."</p>
<p>The English met them at the top; again and again <lb/>
they were driven back, again and again the Maid <lb/>
cheered them on, crying:</p>
<p>"Fear not! &mdash; the place is yours!"</p>
<p>At last, as if to force victory, she sprang into the <lb/>
fosse, and was setting a scaling-ladder against the wall <lb/>
when an arrow pierced her between the neck and <lb/>
shoulder. She was carried to a place of shelter, <reg orig="weep-|ing">weeping</reg> <lb/>
for pain and fright; but her strong courage soon <lb/>
reasserted itself; she drew out the arrow with her own <lb/>
hand, and had the wound dressed with oil, forbidding <lb/>
the men-at-arms to "charm" it, as they in their <reg orig="super-|stitious">superstitious</reg> <lb/>
kindness wanted to do. She then confessed <reg orig="her-|self">herself</reg>, <lb/>
and so, hastened back to the rampart.</p>
<p>There was no success yet for the French, and the <lb/>
captains came to Joan, telling her they intended to <lb/>
retire and suspend the attack until next day. She <reg orig="be-|sought">besought</reg> <lb/>
them to persevere. She tried to break their <lb/>
resolve with brave words. She went to Dunois with <lb/>
prayers and promises.</p>
<p>"In God's name, you shall enter shortly. Doubt not, <lb/>
and the English shall have no more power over you!"</p>
<p>Her entreaties prevailed. Then she ordered the men <lb/>
<pb n="75" entity="b002082275_0100"/>
to rest a while, eat and drink, and when they had done <lb/>
so, bade them renew the attack "in God's name."</p>
<p>She mounted her horse again and rode to a vineyard <lb/>
a little way off, where, out of the turmoil of battle, she <lb/>
prayed a few minutes. On her return she stationed <lb/>
herself near the rampart, holding her standard.</p>
<p>"Watch until my banner touches the fort," she said <lb/>
to a gentleman who stood near. Presently the wind <lb/>
caught it and blew it against the wall.</p>
<p>"It touches, Joan, it touches!" exclaimed the <reg orig="gentle-|man">gentleman</reg>.</p>
<p>She cried to the troops:</p>
<p>"Go in now, all is yours!"</p>
<p>By evening Joan re&euml;ntered Orleans, where she and <lb/>
her men were received with great joy, all the bells of <lb/>
the city ringing out the news of victory. The Maid's <lb/>
wound was dressed carefully, and after her usual supper <lb/>
of bread with a little wine and water, she lay down to <lb/>
sleep.</p>
<p>Very early next morning, those watching in Orleans <lb/>
saw the English quit their bastiles and set themselves <lb/>
before the walls in order of battle. The alarm was <lb/>
given, and the French, led by Joan, came out of the city <lb/>
and ranged themselves in front of their enemies. While <lb/>
the armies stood face to face, as it were waiting for a <lb/>
signal to begin to fight, Joan had a camp-altar brought, <lb/>
and the priests said mass. Then she asked:</p>
<p>"Are the faces of the English towards us, or their <lb/>
backs?"</p>
<p>She was told that they were retreating, and at that <lb/>
moment flames shot up from some of their forts which <lb/>
they had set on fire.</p>
<p>"In God's name," said Joan, "let them go. My <lb/>
<pb n="76" entity="b002082275_0101"/>
Lord does not choose that we shall fight to-day. You <lb/>
shall have them another time."</p>
<p>Crowds rushed out from Orleans to destroy the <reg orig="un-|burnt">unburnt</reg> <lb/>
bastiles, and dragged back the stores and cannon <lb/>
the English had been obliged to leave. But soon the <lb/>
excitement of victory gave way to the enthusiasm of <lb/>
thankfulness. A few days ago the city had been <reg orig="sur-|rounded">surrounded</reg> <lb/>
by enemies, threatened with the sword, more <lb/>
than threatened by famine. But in one marvellous <lb/>
week God and the Maid had delivered it. Now let her <lb/>
who had led the people to victory lead them also to give <lb/>
thanks. They thronged after her. They followed her <lb/>
from church to church, praising God and the saints, <lb/>
God and the Maid, before their rescued altars. Night <lb/>
fell on their rejoicings, and early next morning the Maid <lb/>
left them, eager to rejoin the King, and render an <lb/>
account of her success. Her time for rest was not yet. <lb/>
She had as yet only given the sign promised to the <lb/>
doctors of Poitiers &mdash; only begun the great work she was <lb/>
sent to do.</p>
<p>Scholars, high in place, great in learning, paid her <lb/>
their tribute of praise. But the common people were <lb/>
her most eager admirers and lovers. During her <reg orig="jour-|ney">journey</reg> <lb/>
from Orleans to Tours, they crowded about her, <lb/>
trying to touch her hands, her dress, the trappings of <lb/>
her horse &mdash; even stooping down to kiss the hoof-prints <lb/>
of her horse on the road.</p>
<p>Charles came to meet her at Tours. When she knelt <lb/>
before him, he took off his cap, as to a queen, raised her, <lb/>
and seemed "as if he gladly would have kissed her, for <lb/>
the joy he had." He would have ennobled her at once, <lb/>
and he desired her to take for her arms the lilies of France, <lb/>
with a royal crown and a sword drawn to defend it. <lb/>
<pb n="77" entity="b002082275_0102"/>
Empty honours and easy lip-gratitude were at her service, <lb/>
but she, who had only one noble ambition, cared nothing <lb/>
for them. She wanted but one boon from the King &mdash; <lb/>
ready action. Now was the time to go to Reims, while <lb/>
the English were weakened and disheartened. Let the <lb/>
King come &mdash; she would conduct him there safely and <lb/>
without hindrance &mdash; but let him come at once, for she <lb/>
had much to do, and little time wherein to do it.</p>
<p>"Make use of me," she pleaded, "for I shall last only <lb/>
one year."</p>
<p>Her bold proposal amazed Charles and his council. <lb/>
Go to Reims, to a city held by the English, through a <lb/>
country guarded by hostile troops!</p>
<p>The King, half-persuaded, agreed to go, but not until <lb/>
the English had been driven from the Loire. The <lb/>
captains declared that it would be unwise to march <lb/>
northward while the southern provinces remained so <lb/>
exposed to the enemy, and Joan, whose good sense <lb/>
equalled her courage, deferred to their judgment. An <lb/>
army was assembled, and put under command of the <lb/>
Duke of Alen&ccedil;on, but the King required him to do <lb/>
nothing without the Maid's advice. While she was near <lb/>
Charles, and her brave words were in his ears, he almost <lb/>
believed in her.</p>
<p>On the 9th of June, just a month after her departure <lb/>
from Orleans, Joan returned there with her army. <lb/>
During the campaign she made the city her headquarters, <lb/>
to the delight of its people, who "could not have enough <lb/>
of gazing at her." On the 11th she led the troops against <lb/>
Jargeau, a strong town, bravely defended, but the <reg orig="as-|sailants">assailants</reg> <lb/>
had the advantage of numbers, and, once their <lb/>
fears were forgotten, went boldly to the attack. Joan <lb/>
and the Duke, commanders though they were, went <lb/>
<pb n="78" entity="b002082275_0103"/>
down into the fosse like the rest, and the Maid was <lb/>
climbing a scaling-ladder, when a stone hurled from <lb/>
the rampart struck her to the earth. But she was up <lb/>
in a moment, shouting:</p>
<p>"Friends, friends, go on! Our Lord has condemned <lb/>
the English! They are ours! Be of good courage!" <lb/>
The men swarmed over the walls, and the place was <lb/>
taken. The more important captives were sent down <lb/>
the Loire to Orleans, where Joan and Alen&ccedil;on returned <lb/>
the day after their victory. Soon after, near Patay they <lb/>
came upon the English, who had been warned of their <lb/>
approach, and were getting ready for battle. The Duke <lb/>
asked Joan what was to be done.</p>
<p>"Have you good spurs?" she inquired.</p>
<p>"What!" exclaimed some who stood by; "should we <lb/>
turn our backs?"</p>
<p>"Not so, in God's name!" she answered. "The <lb/>
English shall do that. They will be beaten, and you <lb/>
will want your spurs to pursue them."</p>
<p>Some of the chiefs hung back.</p>
<p>"In God's name, we must fight them!" she cried <lb/>
"Though they were hung to the clouds, we should have <lb/>
them. To-day the King shall have the greatest victory <lb/>
he has won for long. My counsel tells me they are <lb/>
ours."</p>
<p>In slain and prisoners the English lost nearly 3,000 <lb/>
men. Joan was very indignant at the cruelty of the <reg orig="vic-|tors">victors</reg>. <lb/>
Seeing one of them strike down a wounded prisoner <lb/>
she sprang from her horse, raised the poor soldier in her <lb/>
arms, and held him thus while he confessed to a priest <lb/>
whom she had sent for, tenderly comforting him until <lb/>
he died. It was always so with her. Before and during <lb/>
the fight she was the stern champion of France; but <unclear id="u10">when</unclear> <lb/>
<pb n="79" entity="b002082275_0104"/>
it was over she became again a pitying woman, weeping <lb/>
for her dead enemies, and praying for their souls.</p>
<p>Now Joan held her rightful place in the army. Every <lb/>
true and honest man believed in her; even those who had <lb/>
doubted her at Orleans confessed now not only her <lb/>
goodness and courage, but also the instinctive military <lb/>
skill she had shown both in sieges and in the field. <lb/>
Soldiers and leaders were alike eager to follow her to <lb/>
Reims. With nothing to consult and combat but their <lb/>
frank likes and dislikes, her task would have been <lb/>
an easy one; but to do her voices' bidding, she had <lb/>
to hew or wind her way through the intrigues of a <lb/>
court.</p>
<p>Charles demurred at going to Reims at all. He <lb/>
hated trouble, and his life in the south had been pleasant <lb/>
enough. All Joan's victories had as yet done him no <lb/>
substantial good. He was as poor as ever, and the <lb/>
excited men who flocked to the Maid's banner were to <lb/>
him objects less of pride than of distrust.</p>
<p>The Maid, foreseeing more delays, sick at heart of <lb/>
his apathy, could not control her tears, and he, <reg orig="be-|wildered">bewildered</reg> <lb/>
by a grief he could not understand, spoke to <lb/>
her kindly, paid her many compliments, and advised <lb/>
her to take some rest. Still weeping, she besought him <lb/>
to have faith, promising that he should recover his <lb/>
kingdom and be crowned before long.</p>
<p>On Friday, June 24th, she brought the army of the <lb/>
Loire to Gien, whence she sent a letter to the loyal city <lb/>
of Tournay, telling its people of her late successes, and <lb/>
praying them to come to the coronation.</p>
<p>Two days after her arrival at Gien, the justly <reg orig="impa-|tient">impatient</reg> <lb/>
girl quitted the town with some of her troops and <lb/>
encamped in the fields beyond it. Her persistence <lb/>
<pb n="80" entity="b002082275_0105"/>
carried the day. On the 29th, the King and an army <lb/>
of 12,000 men set out for Reims.</p>
<p>On July 5th it reached Troyes. Joan had written to <lb/>
the citizens, requiring them to receive the King, and <lb/>
Charles also bade them surrender, promising them <lb/>
amnesty and easy terms. But the place was well <reg orig="gar-|risoned">garrisoned</reg>, <lb/>
and they determined to resist.</p>
<p>A council was held, and nearly all who were at it <lb/>
advised returning southward. But among those faint <lb/>
hearts was one man who believed in Joan &mdash; the old <lb/>
chancellor &mdash; and he spoke boldly for her. "When the <lb/>
King undertook this journey, he did it not because of the <lb/>
great might of the men-at-arms, nor because of the great <lb/>
wealth he had, nor because the journey seemed possible <lb/>
to him, but because Joan told him to go forward and be <lb/>
crowned at Reims, such being the good pleasure of God." <lb/>
While he was yet speaking, Joan herself knocked at the <lb/>
door. She was let in, and the Archbishop told her the <lb/>
cause of the debate.</p>
<p>She turned to the King.</p>
<p>"Will you believe me?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Speak," he replied, "and if you speak reasonably <lb/>
and profitably, we will gladly believe you."</p>
<p>"Will you believe me?" she said again.</p>
<p>"Yes," repeated Charles, "according to what you <lb/>
say."</p>
<p>That cold answer might well have checked her, but <lb/>
she spoke on:</p>
<p>"Gracious King of France, if you will remain before <lb/>
your city of Troyes, it shall be yours within three days <lb/>
by force or by love &mdash; doubt it not."</p>
<p>"We would wait six, if we could be sure of having it," <lb/>
said the Archbishop.</p>
<pb n="81" entity="b002082275_0106"/>
<p>"Doubt not," she insisted, "you shall have it <reg orig="to-|morrow">to-morrow</reg>."</p>
<p>It was then evening, but she at once mounted her <lb/>
horse and began preparations for an assault. Her <lb/>
energy cheered the soldiers, who were weary of inaction. <lb/>
They dragged the cannons into position, and brought <lb/>
bundles of wood, doors, furniture, everything they could <lb/>
lay hands on, to fill up the fosse. They worked far into <lb/>
the night &mdash; leaders, pages, men-at-arms alike &mdash; Joan <lb/>
directing them "better than two of the best captains <lb/>
could have done."</p>
<p>Through that night there was great excitement within <lb/>
Troyes. The people had heard of Orleans and <reg orig="Jar-|geau">Jargeau</reg>; <lb/>
they could see and hear Joan's preparations. At <lb/>
last they asked loudly why they, French by birth, should <lb/>
risk their city and their lives for England. A council <lb/>
was held, and the heads of the garrison and the city <lb/>
agreed to surrender. Early next morning, just as Joan <lb/>
was giving the signal for the assault, the city gates were <lb/>
opened.</p>
<p>The next day, Sunday, the King entered the town in <lb/>
state, attended by Joan and his nobles.</p>
<p>They left Troyes, and approached Ch&acirc;lons on the <lb/>
15th, and at some distance from the town were met by a <lb/>
number of citizens who had come to offer their <reg orig="sub-|mission">submission</reg>. <lb/>
At Ch&acirc;lons, Joan had the great joy of meeting <lb/>
friends from Domremy. She asked them many <reg orig="ques-|tions">questions</reg> <lb/>
about her home, and they looked with wonder at <lb/>
the girl who lived familiarly with princes, and yet spoke <lb/>
and behaved as simply as ever she had done in the days <lb/>
of her obscurity. One of them inquired whether she <lb/>
feared nothing.</p>
<p>"Nothing but treachery," was her foreboding answer.</p>
<pb n="82" entity="b002082275_0107"/>
<p>When the people of Reims heard that Ch&acirc;lons had <lb/>
submitted, and that Charles was within four leagues, <lb/>
they sent deputies to tender their obedience, and that <lb/>
same day, Saturday, July 16th, Charles entered the city.</p>
<p>Preparations were at once made for his coronation, <lb/>
and early next morning four nobles went to the abbey of <lb/>
St. R&eacute;mi to escort thence the ampulla containing the <lb/>
sacred oil which a dove had brought from heaven to the <lb/>
saint. The abbot, in full canonicals, carried it to the <lb/>
cathedral, where the Archbishop of Reims received it <lb/>
from him, and set it on the high altar. Below the altar <lb/>
stood the Dauphin, attended by the nobles and clergy <lb/>
who acted as proxies for the peers of France who should <lb/>
have been with him. By his side was Joan, holding her <lb/>
sacred banner. The ceremony was performed <reg orig="accord-|ing">according</reg> <lb/>
to the ancient rites, and when it was over, Joan knelt <lb/>
at the feet of Charles, her King indeed now, crowned <lb/>
and anointed.</p>
<p>"Gracious King," she said, "now is fulfilled the <lb/>
pleasure of God, whose will it was that you should come <lb/>
to Reims to receive your worthy coronation, showing <lb/>
that you are the true King to whom the kingdom should <lb/>
belong." As she spoke she wept, and all who were in <lb/>
the church wept for sympathy. Among those who <reg orig="wit-|nessed">witnessed</reg> <lb/>
her triumph was her father, who had come to <lb/>
Reims to see her. The good man was honourably <lb/>
treated; the corporation of the town paid his expenses, <lb/>
and when he returned to Domremy, gave him a horse for <lb/>
the journey.</p>
<p>After his coronation, when Charles was bestowing <lb/>
honours and rewards on his followers, Joan asked him <lb/>
for one favour, which he granted readily &mdash; freedom <lb/>
from taxation for her native Domremy and the adjoining <lb/>
<pb n="83" entity="b002082275_0108"/>
village of Greux. For herself she wanted nothing, <lb/>
except what she had already claimed and failed to receive, <lb/>
what the King never gave her &mdash; his trust.</p>
<p>She had given a king to France, now she had to give <lb/>
France to her King. She longed to be again at work. <lb/>
Every day of waiting was a day of pain to her. Now that <lb/>
her King was crowned, she would have him press forward <lb/>
to Paris, defy the English, and startle the disloyal French <lb/>
into loyalty; but the evil advice of his courtiers and his <lb/>
own indolence made him catch at every excuse for delay.</p>
<p>During the northward march of the army, people from <lb/>
every place on the road crowded to welcome Joan and <lb/>
the King, crying, No&euml;l, No&euml;l, and singing <foreign lang="dut"><hi rend="italic">Te Deums</hi></foreign> <lb/>
before them. Joan was first. They were glad to have <lb/>
a French King again, but their chief love and <reg orig="enthu-|siasm">enthusiasm</reg> <lb/>
were for her, the heroic girl in shining armour, <lb/>
with her calm face and gentle voice. The common folk <lb/>
called her "the angelic"; they sang songs about her; <lb/>
images of her were put up in little country churches; a <lb/>
special collect was said at mass, thanking God for her <lb/>
having saved France; medals were struck in her honour, <lb/>
and worn as amulets. The people pressed about her <lb/>
horse, and kissed her hands and feet. She was often <lb/>
vexed by this excess of homage, which brought upon her <lb/>
the displeasure of many churchmen.</p>
<p>Near Crespy, as she, riding between Dunois and <lb/>
Regnault de Chartres, passed through the welcoming <lb/>
crowd, she said:</p>
<p>"What good people! I have yet seen none so joyful <lb/>
at the coming of their prince. May I be so happy as <lb/>
to die and be buried in this land!"</p>
<p>"Oh, Joan," said the Archbishop, "in what place do <lb/>
you expect to die?"</p>
<pb n="84" entity="b002082275_0109"/>
<p>"Wherever it shall please God," she answered, "for <lb/>
I know not the place nor the hour any more than <reg orig="your-|self">yourself</reg>. <lb/>
Would to God that I might return now, and lay <lb/>
down my arms, and go back to serve my parents, and <lb/>
guard their flocks with my sister and brothers, who <lb/>
would be right glad to see me." She must often have <lb/>
longed for her home, but never except this once did she <lb/>
express her longing. She had a rare reticence for one so <lb/>
young and simple. "She spoke little, and showed a <lb/>
marvellous prudence in her words."</p>
<p>Joan greatly desired the King's arrival before Paris, <lb/>
believing that his mere presence would make its gates <lb/>
fly open like those of Reims and Soissons. The King's <lb/>
folly and the ill-will of his favourites were not Joan's <lb/>
only troubles. The army before Paris was not like that <lb/>
chosen army she had led to Orleans, a company of men <lb/>
"confessed, penitent," who for the time seemed purified <lb/>
from evil desires, and followed her as to a holy war. <lb/>
Such a state of things, fair to the eye, but born only of <lb/>
the froth and ecstasy of religion, could not last, as the <lb/>
Maid in her young confidence perhaps expected. She <lb/>
had now to grieve because of her soldiers' habits of <reg orig="blas-|phemy">blasphemy</reg> <lb/>
and pillage.</p>
<p>On the morning of September 8th, the festival of the <lb/>
Virgin's nativity, they advanced to attack the city. They <lb/>
were divided into two corps. One, led by Joan, Gaucourt, <lb/>
and Retz, went at once to the assault. The attack <lb/>
began about noon; the bastion of the St. Honor&eacute; gate <lb/>
having been set on fire, its defenders were forced to <lb/>
abandon it, and the assailants, headed by Joan, passed <lb/>
the outer fosse. She climbed the ridge separating it <lb/>
from the inner fosse, which was full of water, and from <lb/>
that place summoned the city to surrender. She was <lb/>
<pb n="85" entity="b002082275_0110"/>
answered with jeers and insults and a shower of missiles, <lb/>
amid which she carefully sounded the fosse with her <lb/>
lance, and found that it was of unusual depth. At her <lb/>
bidding the men brought faggots and hurdles to fill it <lb/>
up and make a resting-place for their ladders, but while <lb/>
she was directing them, an arrow wounded her in the <lb/>
thigh so severely that she was forced to lie down at the <lb/>
edge of the fosse. She suffered, as she afterwards <reg orig="con-|fessed">confessed</reg>, <lb/>
agonies of pain, but she never ceased to encourage <lb/>
her men, bidding them advance boldly, for the place <lb/>
would be taken. The place would have been taken, but <lb/>
the captains who were with Joan, seeing that the hours <lb/>
went by and the men were struck down without <reg orig="achiev-|ing">achieving</reg> <lb/>
much, ordered a retreat. The trumpets sounded; <lb/>
the men withdrew, Joan, desperate in her sorrow, clung <lb/>
to the ground, declaring she would not go until the place <lb/>
was won. At about ten o'clock Gaucourt had her <reg orig="re-|moved">removed</reg> <lb/>
by force and set upon her horse. She was carried <lb/>
back to La Chapelle, suffering in body, suffering more <lb/>
in mind, but still resolute.</p>
<p>"The city would have been taken!" she insisted. "It <lb/>
would have been taken!"</p>
<p>Joan spent four weary months &mdash; how weary we <lb/>
conjecture chiefly from what we know of her character <lb/>
and her aspirations. Occasionally she rode with a few <lb/>
followers to visit some town where she was known, but <lb/>
generally she was with the Court, a sad and unwilling <lb/>
spectator of its festivities. Sad only because of her <lb/>
unfulfilled mission: had she been suffered to work it out, <lb/>
to see France delivered, she would doubtless have taken <lb/>
pleasure in show and gaiety. She was at home and <lb/>
happy with knights and ladies, and took a frank delight <lb/>
in rich garments and fine armour. She was no bigot. <lb/>
<pb n="86" entity="b002082275_0111"/>
her sanctity was altogether wholesome: it was an exalted <lb/>
love for God, for France and the King, unsoured by any <lb/>
contempt for the common life of humanity.</p>
<p>Wherever she went she visited the sick, she gave all <lb/>
she could in alms, she was devoted to the services of the <lb/>
church and to prayer. The people, who knew of her <lb/>
greatness and saw her goodness, treated her with a <lb/>
reverence that was akin to superstition. They brought <lb/>
rings and crosses for her to touch, and so turn into <reg orig="amu-|lets">amulets</reg>. <lb/>
"Touch them yourselves," she would say, laughing, <lb/>
"they will be just as good." Some believed that she had <lb/>
a charmed life, and need never fear going into battle.</p>
<p>Joan grew desperate. Sad voices from beyond the <lb/>
Loire were calling her. She was greatly wanted there, <lb/>
and the King &mdash; her King whom she had crowned &mdash; <lb/>
did not want her, cared nothing for her nor for his <lb/>
people's trouble. She asked counsel of her other voices, <lb/>
of her saints, and they neither bade her go nor stay; <lb/>
they told her only one certain thing, that before St. <lb/>
John's day she would be taken. If so &mdash; if indeed, as <lb/>
she herself had said, she was to last only a year &mdash; then <lb/>
the more need to hasten with her work. One day at <lb/>
the end of March she left Sully with a small company, <lb/>
as if going for one of her usual rides. She did not bid <lb/>
farewell to the King, and she never saw him again.</p>
<p>It was a time of sad forebodings for her. A story goes, <lb/>
that one morning, after hearing mass in the church of <lb/>
St. Jacques, she went apart and leaned dejectedly against <lb/>
a pillar. Some grown people and a crowd of children <lb/>
came about her &mdash; she was always gentle to children &mdash; <lb/>
and she said to them:</p>
<p>"My children and dear friends, I tell you that I am <lb/>
sold and betrayed, and that I shall soon be given up to <lb/>
<pb n="87" entity="b002082275_0112"/>
death. Therefore I entreat you to pray for me, for <lb/>
never again shall I have any power to serve the King or <lb/>
the Kingdom of France." She was not "sold and <reg orig="be-|trayed">betrayed</reg>" <lb/>
yet; that was to come.</p>
<p>Depression could not make her inactive. She went to <lb/>
Crespy for reinforcements, but hearing that the siege of <lb/>
Compi&egrave;gne had begun, she hurried back there on the <lb/>
night of April 23rd, with about four hundred men. She <lb/>
entered the place at sunrise, and spent the chief part of <lb/>
the day in arranging a sortie, to be made before evening. <lb/>
Compi&egrave;gne, situated on the south bank of the Oise, was <lb/>
connected with the opposite shore by a bridge, from <lb/>
which a raised causeway went over the low river meadows <lb/>
to the hill-slopes of Picardy.</p>
<p>Late in the afternoon, Joan, with five hundred foot <lb/>
and horsemen, made a short charge. Then Joan's <lb/>
troops feared to be cut off from Compi&egrave;gne, to be left in <lb/>
a country dotted with the enemy's camps, and most of <lb/>
them turned, panic-stricken, and fled towards the city.</p>
<p>The English gained the causeway, and the archers <lb/>
stationed there dared not shoot on them for fear of <lb/>
hurting their own people. The guns of Compi&egrave;gne <lb/>
were useless, for friends and foes were mingled in a <reg orig="con-|fused">confused</reg> <lb/>
struggle. Joan tried to rally her men:</p>
<p>"Hold your peace!" she cried to some who spoke of <lb/>
retreating. "It depends on you to discomfit them! <lb/>
Think only of falling upon them!"</p>
<p>But her words were in vain. All she could do was to <lb/>
cover the retreat, and that she did valiantly, riding last, <lb/>
and charging back often. Thanks to her a great part <lb/>
of the fugitives got safely into the city, while others <lb/>
reached the boats; but the English pressed towards the <lb/>
gate to cut off the retreat of the remainder, and <reg orig="Guil-|laume">Guillaume</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="88" entity="b002082275_0113"/>
de Flavy, afraid, as he said, lest in the confusion <lb/>
they might rush into the town itself, ordered the <reg orig="draw-|bridge">drawbridge</reg> <lb/>
to be raised, and the portcullis lowered. There <lb/>
was no escape for the Maid now. She and a little <reg orig="de-|voted">devoted</reg> <lb/>
band that kept with her fought desperately, but <lb/>
they were driven into an angle of the fortifications; <lb/>
many fell in defending her.</p>
<p>Compi&egrave;gne remained shut. The city to whose help <lb/>
she had come at dawn saw her lost at its very gates <lb/>
before sundown, and made no effort to save her. Five <lb/>
or six men rushed on her at once, each crying:</p>
<p>"Yield to me! Pledge your faith to me!"</p>
<p>"I have sworn and pledged my faith to another than <lb/>
you," she said, "and I will keep my oath."</p>
<p>She still struck at those who tried to seize her; but an <lb/>
archer came behind her, and, grasping the <reg orig="gold-|embroidered">gold-embroidered</reg> <lb/>
surcoat that she wore, dragged her from <lb/>
her horse. She fell, exhausted and overcome at last, <lb/>
and the man who had pulled her down carried her to his <lb/>
master.</p>
<p>She was taken to Margny, and thither flocked the <lb/>
English and Burgundian captains, "more joyful than if <lb/>
they had taken five hundred fighting men." In this <lb/>
very month of her capture, it had been found needful to <lb/>
issue proclamations against English soldiers, men of the <lb/>
old conquering race, who had refused to come over to <lb/>
France for fear of the Witch. And now here was the <lb/>
Witch, vanquished, powerless, her armour soiled in the <lb/>
fight, her magic banner fallen away from her. The <lb/>
chiefs could hardly believe their good fortune, but her <lb/>
sad presence was there to assure them of it, and they <lb/>
came and gazed on her.</p>
<p>The weeks went by, and no one stirred to help her. <lb/>
<pb n="89" entity="b002082275_0114"/>
Her captors' scruples were overcome, and before winter <lb/>
she was bought and sold. John of Luxembourg got ten <lb/>
thousand livres &mdash; two thousand dollars.</p>
<p>Hitherto we have seen Joan, a gracious figure always <lb/>
&mdash; better always and nobler than her surroundings &mdash; <lb/>
but never yet solitary in goodness and nobleness. Other <lb/>
figures have been grouped about her, gracious also in <lb/>
their degree, worthy to divide with her our sympathy, <lb/>
and to have some share in our love. Now they are all <lb/>
gone from her. Father and mother, village friends and <lb/>
kinsfolk, devoted comrades and adoring people, are all <lb/>
shut away from her for ever. The old life is over.</p>
<p>She is desolate, and worse than alone; to the darling <lb/>
of the saints, loneliness would be no such terrible <reg orig="pun-|ishment">punishment</reg>. <lb/>
Wrong and horror crowd upon her. Her <lb/>
honour and her life are in the hands of men evil by <reg orig="nat-|ure">nature</reg>, <lb/>
or turned to evil by hatred, or greed, or fear. Here <lb/>
and there a judge speaks some word in favour of <reg orig="ban-|ished">banished</reg> <lb/>
justice, but those feeble flashes leave no light in <lb/>
the gloom. The light shines all on Joan. The pure <lb/>
maiden, the noble heroine, stands out, heaven-illumined, <lb/>
against the darkness. Her sorrow and her endurance <lb/>
of it crown and sanctify her. Piteous though her fate <lb/>
be, we almost forget to pity her, for compassion is <reg orig="well-|nigh">well-nigh</reg> <lb/>
lost in reverence and wonder.</p>
<p>On her arrival at Rouen, Joan was taken to the castle, <lb/>
and put into an iron cage that had been made to receive <lb/>
her; and, as if its bars were not enough, she was chained <lb/>
in it by her neck, her hands and her feet. After being <lb/>
kept thus for several days, she was transferred to a <lb/>
gloomy chamber in one of the towers, where she was <lb/>
fettered to a great log of wood during the day, and to her <lb/>
<pb n="90" entity="b002082275_0115"/>
bed at night. Both by night and day she was guarded <lb/>
by five English soldiers of the lowest and rudest class, <lb/>
three of whom were always with her, while the other <lb/>
two kept the door outside.</p>
<p>Once given over to the Church, she should have been <lb/>
placed in an ecclesiastical prison, and guarded by <lb/>
women. For this right she pleaded often, and her plea <lb/>
was supported by several of her judges. But the <reg orig="Eng-|lish">English</reg> <lb/>
would not lose their grip of a captive who had cost <lb/>
them and lost them so much, and Pierre Cauchon, <lb/>
Bishop of Beauvais, had too great fear of displeasing <lb/>
them to advise such a simple measure of decency and <lb/>
justice.</p>
<p>Joan had visitors in her prison. English nobles <lb/>
whose nobility did not keep them from insulting a woman <lb/>
and a helpless captive, came to stare and jest at her. <lb/>
Warwick and Stafford came one day, and with them a <lb/>
man who might well have shrunk from looking her in <lb/>
the face &mdash; the Judas of Luxembourg. He told her he <lb/>
had come to ransom her, on condition that she would not <lb/>
again take up arms against England. She answered <lb/>
him scornfully, as he deserevd:</p>
<p>"In God's name, you but mock me, for I know you <lb/>
have neither the will nor the power to do it;" and she <lb/>
added, "I know that the English will kill me, thinking <lb/>
to have the kingdom of France after my death; but were <lb/>
they a hundred thousand Goddams more than they are, <lb/>
they should not have the kingdom."</p>
<p>Cauchon refused the Maid's just request for counsel <lb/>
to advise and defend her during her examination. But <lb/>
he was not merciful enough to leave her to the <reg orig="guid-|ance">guidance</reg> <lb/>
of her own wise brain and true heart. According <lb/>
to the bad custom of the Inquisition, he sent her a sham <lb/>
<pb n="91" entity="b002082275_0116"/>
confidant, a creature even more abject than himself &mdash; <lb/>
his friend and tool, the Canon Loyseleur. This man <lb/>
went to Joan in disguise, and told her that he, too, was <lb/>
a prisoner, a loyal subject of King Charles, and a native <lb/>
of her own province. The guards left them together, and <lb/>
she, poor child! being glad to see a friendly face, talked to <lb/>
him with a trustfulness that might have touched even <lb/>
such a heart as his. The bishop listened in an <reg orig="adjoin-|ing">adjoining</reg> <lb/>
room, and stationed two scribes there to report <lb/>
Joan's words; but the men were too honest for such <lb/>
work, and refused to do it. To gain her fuller <reg orig="confi-|dence">confidence</reg>, <lb/>
Loyseleur made known to her that he was a <lb/>
priest, and heard her in confession. He also gave her <lb/>
counsel how to answer her judges &mdash; bad and crooked <lb/>
counsel, of which she availed herself little, but still <lb/>
enough for us to trace here and there the influence of <lb/>
an evil mind over hers.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, February 20th, she was summoned to <lb/>
appear next day before her judges. Having heard and <lb/>
seen what they were, she demanded that an equal <lb/>
number of assessors of the French party should be <reg orig="asso-|ciated">associated</reg> <lb/>
with them. She also entreated the Bishop of <lb/>
Beauvais to let her hear religious service. The prayer <lb/>
was denied.</p>
<p>Joan appeared before them a youthful, girlish creature <lb/>
in her masculine dress. The dress was all black, relieved <lb/>
only by the pale prison-worn face, from which the dark <lb/>
eyes looked out fearlessly.</p>
<p>The bishop began by briefly stating the crimes she <lb/>
was accused of, and explaining to her how he came to <lb/>
be her judge. He then exhorted her, "with gentleness <lb/>
and charity," to answer truly all questions put to <lb/>
her. From the first moment of the trial she was on her <lb/>
<pb n="92" entity="b002082275_0117"/>
guard. She felt her judges' falsehood and malevolence <lb/>
in the very air around her.</p>
<p>The Gospels were brought, and she was ordered to <lb/>
swear upon them that she would speak the truth. She <lb/>
hesitated.</p>
<p>"I do not know what questions you may put to me," <lb/>
she said. "Perhaps you will ask me things I cannot tell <lb/>
you."</p>
<p>"Will you swear," insisted Cauchon, "to speak the <lb/>
truth about whatever you are asked concerning the faith, <lb/>
and whatever you know?" She answered that she <lb/>
would willingly speak of her parents, and of all her own <lb/>
actions since she had left Domremy.</p>
<p>Jean Beaup&egrave;re took up the examination. His first <lb/>
question was, when she had last eaten and drunk. It <lb/>
was the season of Lent; if she had taken food as usual, <lb/>
she might be accused of contempt for the Church; if she <lb/>
had fasted, she gave colour to a theory of Beaup&egrave;re's, <lb/>
that her visions were induced chiefly by physical causes. <lb/>
She told him she had fasted since noon the day before. <lb/>
He inquired at what hour she had last heard the voice. <lb/>
"I heard it yesterday and to-day," she said. "I was <lb/>
asleep, and it woke me. &hellip; I do not know whether <lb/>
it was in my room, but it was in the castle. &hellip; I <lb/>
thanked it, sitting up in my bed, with clasped hands, <lb/>
and implored its counsel. &hellip; I had asked God <lb/>
to teach me by its counsel how to answer."</p>
<p>"And what did the voice say?"</p>
<p>"It told me to answer boldly, and God would help <lb/>
me." Here she turned to the bishop. "You say that <lb/>
you are my judge. Take heed what you do, for indeed <lb/>
I am sent by God, and you are putting yourself in great <lb/>
peril."</p>
<pb n="93" entity="b002082275_0118"/>
<p>Beaup&egrave;re asked her if the voice never varied in its <lb/>
counsel.</p>
<p>"No," she said; "it has never contradicted itself. <lb/>
Last night again it bade me answer boldly."</p>
<p>Her dress, her banner and pennon, were inquired <lb/>
about. Had not the Knights, her companions, their <lb/>
pennons made after the pattern of hers? Had she not <lb/>
told them that such pennons would be lucky? To this <lb/>
she answered:</p>
<p>"I said to my men &mdash; 'Go in boldly among the <lb/>
English!' &mdash; <hi rend="italic">and I went myself</hi>".</p>
<p>"Did you not tell them to carry their pennons boldly, <lb/>
and they would have good luck?"</p>
<p>"I indeed told them what came to pass, and will come <lb/>
to pass again."</p>
<p>Had she not ordered pictures or images of herself to <lb/>
be made? No, nor had she ever seen any image in her <lb/>
likeness. She had seen a picture of herself at Arras. <lb/>
She was represented kneeling on one knee, and presenting <lb/>
letters to the King.</p>
<p>Did she know that those of her party had caused <lb/>
masses and prayers to be said in her honour?</p>
<p>"I know nothing of it," she answered, "and if they <lb/>
did so, it was not by my command. Nevertheless, if <lb/>
they prayed for me, I think they did no wrong."</p>
<p>"Do those of your party believe firmly that you are <lb/>
sent by God?"</p>
<p>"I do not know. I leave that to their consciences. <lb/>
But if they do not believe it, I am none the less sent by <lb/>
Him."</p>
<p>"Do you think them right in believing it?"</p>
<p>"If they believe that I am sent by God, they are not <lb/>
deceived."</p>
<pb n="94" entity="b002082275_0119"/>
<p>"Did you understand the feelings of those who kissed <lb/>
your feet, your hands and your garments?"</p>
<p>"Many were glad to see me. I let them kiss my <lb/>
hands as little as possible; but the poor people came to <lb/>
me gladly, because I did them no unkindness, but helped <lb/>
them as much as I could."</p>
<p>"Did not the women touch their rings with the ring <lb/>
you wore?"</p>
<p>"Many women touched my hands and my rings, but <lb/>
I do not know why they did so."</p>
<p>For more than three months her trial went on. But <lb/>
her fate was settled now. The Inquisition had no <lb/>
pardon for her. The judges left her, a few daring to be <lb/>
sorry for the brave creature, but most of them openly <lb/>
and indecently glad. In the courtyard they found a <lb/>
number of English waiting for news, among them the <lb/>
Earl of Warwick.</p>
<p>"Farewell, farewell!" cried the bishop, as he passed <lb/>
him; "be of good cheer &mdash; it is done!"</p>
<p>Her guilt was proved; let her be given over to the <lb/>
secular power; but first let her be charitably exhorted for <lb/>
her soul's welfare, and warned that she had nothing <lb/>
more to hope for in this world.</p>
<p>The bishop ordered a citation to be drawn up, <reg orig="sum-|moning">summoning</reg> <lb/>
Joan to appear next morning in the Old Market <lb/>
Place of Rouen, to receive her final sentence. She did <lb/>
not hear her doom that night &lpar;May 30, 1431&rpar;, but the <lb/>
grave faces and grave words of the monks showed her <lb/>
the dreadful reality, and for a little while youth and <lb/>
womanhood and human weakness had their own way <lb/>
with her. She wept piteously.</p>
<p>"Alas," she cried, "will they treat me so horribly and <lb/>
<pb n="95" entity="b002082275_0120"/>
truelly? Must my body be consumed to-day and turned <lb/>
<unclear id="u11">o ashes?</unclear> Ah! I would sooner seven times be beheaded <lb/>
than be burnt! Oh, I appeal to God, the great Judge, <lb/>
against the wrong and injustice done to me!"</p>
<p>While she was thus lamenting Cauchon came in, with <lb/>
Pierre Maurice, and two or three others. Seeing him, <lb/>
she cried:</p>
<p>"Bishop, I die by you!"</p>
<p>Maurice looked kindly at her as he went, and she said <lb/>
to him:</p>
<p>"Master Pierre, where shall I be to-night?"</p>
<p>"Have you not a good hope in God?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Ah, yes, and by God's grace, I shall be in <reg orig="Par-|adise">Paradise</reg>."</p>
<p>She received the sacrament with tears, and with deep <lb/>
penitence and devotion. Thenceforth her faith was <lb/>
unshaken, and she failed no more.</p>
<p>Next morning at nine o'clock she left the prison, clothed <lb/>
now in a woman's long gown, and wearing a mitre, <reg orig="in-|scribed">inscribed</reg> <lb/>
with the words, <hi rend="italic">Heretic, Relapsed, Apostate, <lb/>
Idolatress.</hi> A cart was waiting for her, and she got into <lb/>
it, accompanied by Brother Martin and the usher <reg orig="Mas-|sieu">Massieu</reg>. <lb/>
A guard of about eight hundred soldiers <reg orig="sur-|rounded">surrounded</reg> <lb/>
her to keep off the crowd, but suddenly there <lb/>
rushed through their ranks a haggard and miserable <lb/>
figure. It was Nicolaus Loyseleur, who, seized by late <lb/>
and vain remorse, had come to ask forgiveness of her <lb/>
whom he had betrayed. But before he could reach her, <lb/>
the soldiers drove him back, and Joan probably neither <lb/>
saw nor heard him, for she was weeping and praying, <lb/>
her head bowed upon her hands.</p>
<p>When she looked up, she saw beyond the soldiers a <lb/>
dense throng of people, most of them grieving for her, <lb/>
<pb n="96" entity="b002082275_0121"/>
many of them lamenting that this thing should be done <lb/>
in their city.</p>
<p>"O Rouen, Rouen!" she cried, "is it here that I must <lb/>
die?"</p>
<p>At last she reached the Old Market Place, a very large <lb/>
space, where had been raised three scaffolds: one for the <lb/>
Bishop of Beauvais and his colleagues, and for all the <lb/>
prelates and nobles who desired to see the show; another <lb/>
for Joan and some priests and officials; the third, also <lb/>
for Joan &mdash; a pile of stone and plaster, raised high above <lb/>
the heads of the crowd, and heaped with faggots. In <lb/>
front of it was a tablet bearing this inscription:</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Joan, who has called herself The Maid &mdash; liar, <reg orig="perni-|cious">pernicious</reg>, <lb/>
deceiver of the people, sorceress, superstitious, <lb/>
blasphemer of God, presumptuous, disbeliever of the faith <lb/>
of Christ, boaster, idolatress, dissolute, invoker of devils, <lb/>
apostate, schismatic, heretic.</hi></p>
<p>Master Nicolas Midi, a famous doctor from Paris, <lb/>
preached Joan's last sermon, on the text, "If one <reg orig="mem-|ber">member</reg> <lb/>
suffer, all the members suffer with it."</p>
<p>At its close, he addressed her:</p>
<p>"Joan, go in peace! The Church can no longer <lb/>
defend you; it gives you up to the secular power."</p>
<p>Then the bishop spoke to her. He did not read the <lb/>
form of abjuration, as had been advised, for she would <lb/>
have boldly disavowed it, and would so have spoilt a <lb/>
scheme he had concocted. But he admonished her to <lb/>
think of her salvation, to remember her misdeeds, and <lb/>
repent of them. Finally, after the usual inquisitorial <lb/>
form, he declared her cut off from the Church, and <lb/>
delivered over to secular justice.</p>
<p>She needed no exhortation to prayer and penitence. <lb/>
For a while she seemed to forget the gazing crowd and <lb/>
<pb n="97" entity="b002082275_0122"/>
the cruel judges. She knelt and prayed fervently &mdash; <lb/>
prayed aloud with such passionate pathos, that all who <lb/>
heard her were moved to tears. Even Cauchon wept. <lb/>
Even the Cardinal was touched. She forgave her <reg orig="ene-|mies">enemies</reg>; <lb/>
she remembered the King, who had forgotten her; <lb/>
she asked pardon of all, imploring all to pray for her, <lb/>
and especially entreating the priests to say a mass for <lb/>
her soul. Presently she asked for a cross. An English <lb/>
soldier broke a stick in two and made a rough cross, <lb/>
which he gave her. She kissed it and put it in her <lb/>
bosom, weeping, calling upon God and the saints.</p>
<p>But the men-at-arms were growing impatient." Come, <lb/>
you priests!" shouted one of them, "are you going to <lb/>
make us dine here?"</p>
<p>The bailiff of Rouen, as representing the secular power, <lb/>
should have now pronounced sentenced of death, but he <lb/>
seemed afraid of delaying the soldiers, two of whom <lb/>
came up and seized Joan.</p>
<p>"Take her! take her!" he said, hurriedly, and he <lb/>
bade the executioner "do his duty." The bishop's <lb/>
trial had, after all, an illegal and informal ending.</p>
<p>The soldiers dragged Joan to the pile, and as she <lb/>
climbed it, some of her judges left their platform and <lb/>
rushed away, fearing to behold what they had helped <lb/>
to bring about. She was fastened to the stake, high up, <lb/>
that the flames might gain slowly upon her, and that the <lb/>
executioner might not be able to reach her and <reg orig="merci-|fully">mercifully</reg> <lb/>
shorten her agony.</p>
<p>"Ah, Rouen!" she cried again, as she looked over the <lb/>
city, bright in the May sunshine &mdash; "Ah, Rouen, Rouen! <lb/>
I fear thou wilt have to suffer for my death!"</p>
<p>The executioner set fire to the pile. The confessor <lb/>
was by Joan's side, praying with her, comforting her so <lb/>
<pb n="98" entity="b002082275_0123"/>
earnestly, that he took no notice of the ascending flames <lb/>
It was she who saw them and bade him leave her.</p>
<p>"But hold up the cross," she said, "that I may see it."</p>
<p>Now Cauchon went to the foot of the pile, hoping <lb/>
perhaps that his victim might say some word of <reg orig="recan-|tation">recantation</reg>. <lb/>
Perceiving him there, she cried aloud:</p>
<p>"Bishop, I die by you!"</p>
<p>And now the flames reached her, and she shrank <lb/>
from them in terror, calling for water &mdash; holy water! <lb/>
But as they rose and rose and wrapped her round, she <lb/>
seemed to draw strength from their awful contact. She <lb/>
still spoke. Brother Martin, standing in the heat and <lb/>
glare of the fire, holding the cross aloft for her comfort, <lb/>
heard her dying words:</p>
<p>"Jesus! Jesus! Mary! My voices! My voices!"</p>
<p>Did she hear them, those voices that had said, "Fret <lb/>
not thyself because of thy martyrdom; thou shalt come <lb/>
at last to the Kingdom of Paradise"?</p>
<p>"Yes," she said, "my voices were from God! My <lb/>
voices have not deceived me!" Then, uttering one great <lb/>
cry &mdash; "Jesus!" she drooped her head upon her breast, <lb/>
and died.</p>
<p>The common folk soon added their tale of signs and <lb/>
wonders to the simple and terrible truth. An English <lb/>
soldier, who greatly hated the Maid, had sworn to bring <lb/>
a faggot to her burning, and he threw it on the pile just <lb/>
as she gave that last cry. Suddenly he fell senseless to <lb/>
the earth, and when he recovered, he told how at that <lb/>
moment he had looked up, and had seen a white dove fly <lb/>
heavenward out of the fire. Others declared that they <lb/>
had seen the word Jesus &mdash; her dying word &mdash; written <lb/>
in the flames. The executioner rushed to a confessor <lb/>
<pb n="99" entity="b002082275_0124"/>
crying that he feared to be damned, for he had burned a <lb/>
holy woman. But her heart would not burn, he told the <lb/>
priest; the rest of her body he had found consumed to <lb/>
ashes, but her heart was left whole and unharmed.</p>
<p>Many, not of the populace, were moved by her death <lb/>
to recognise what she had been in life.</p>
<p>"I would that my soul were where I believe the soul of <lb/>
that woman is! "exclaimed Jean Alesp&eacute;e, one of the judges.</p>
<p>"We are all lost; we have burnt a saint!" cried <reg orig="Tres-|sart">Tressart</reg>, <lb/>
a secretary of the King of England. Winchester <lb/>
&mdash; determined that, though she might be called a saint, <lb/>
there should be no relics of her &mdash; had her ashes <reg orig="care-|fully">carefully</reg> <lb/>
collected and thrown into the Seine.</p>
<p>The tidings of her death went speedily through France. <lb/>
They found Charles in his southern retirement, and nowise <lb/>
disturbed the ease of mind and body that was more to him <lb/>
than honour. They reached Domremy, and broke the heart <lb/>
of Joan's stern, loving father. Isabelle Rom&eacute;e lived to <lb/>
see her child's memory righted and herprophecies fulfilled</p>
<p>In June, 1455, Pope Calixtus, named a commission to <lb/>
inquire into the trial of Joan of Arc.</p>
<p>Joan's aged mother came before them, supported by <lb/>
her sons, and followed by a great procession of nobles, <lb/>
scholars, and honourable ladies. She presented the <lb/>
petition she had made to the Pope, and the letter whereby <lb/>
he granted it, and the commissioners took her aside, <lb/>
heard her testimony, and promised to do her justice</p>
<p>And now the dead heroine was confronted with her <lb/>
dead judges, to their shame and her enduring honour. <lb/>
Messengers were sent into her country to hear the story <lb/>
of her innocent childhood and pure, unselfish youth. <lb/>
Through her whole life went the inquiry, gathering <reg orig="testi-|mony">testimony</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="100" entity="b002082275_0125"/>
from people of all ranks. The peasants whom, <lb/>
she had loved and tended in her early girlhood, the men <lb/>
who had fought by her side, the women who had known <lb/>
and honoured her, the officers of the trial, and many who <lb/>
had watched her sufferings and beheld her death &mdash; all <lb/>
were called to speak for her now. They testified to her <lb/>
goodness, her purity, her single-hearted love for France, <lb/>
her piety, her boldness in war, and her good sense in <lb/>
counsel. All were for her &mdash; not one voice was raised <lb/>
against her. Rouen, the place of her martyrdom, <reg orig="be-|came">became</reg> <lb/>
the place of her triumph.</p>
<p>The judges pronounced the whole trial to be polluted <lb/>
by wrong and calumny, and therefore null and void; <lb/>
finally, they proclaimed that neither Joan nor any of her <lb/>
kindred had incurred any blot of infamy, and freed them <lb/>
from every shadow of disgrace.</p>
<p>By order of the tribunal, this new verdict was read <reg orig="pub-|licly">publicly</reg> <lb/>
in all the cities of France, and first at Rouen, and in <lb/>
the Old Market Place, where she had been cruelly burnt. <lb/>
This was done with great solemnity; processions were <lb/>
made, sermons were preached, and on the site of her <lb/>
martyrdom a stone cross was soon raised to her memory.</p>
<p>The world has no relic of Joan. Her armour, her <lb/>
banner, the picture of herself that she saw at Arras, have <lb/>
all disappeared. We possess but the record of a fair <lb/>
face framed in plentiful dark hair, of a strong and <reg orig="grace-|ful">graceful</reg> <lb/>
shape, of a sweet woman's voice. And it seems &mdash; <lb/>
and yet, indeed, hardly is &mdash; a wonder that no worthy <lb/>
poem has been made in her honour. She is one of the <lb/>
few for whom poet and romancer can do little; for as <lb/>
there is nothing in her life that needs either to be <lb/>
hidden or adorned, we see her best in the clear and <lb/>
searching light of history.</p>

her heroic act when she barred the door with her arm against the <lb/>
murderers of James the First of Scots, received popularly the <lb/>
name of "Barlass." The name remains to her descendants, the <lb/>
Barlas family, in Scotland, who bear for their crest a broken arm. <lb/>
She married Alexander Lovell of Bolunnie.</p>
<p>A few stanzas from King James's lovely poem, known as <hi rend="italic">The <lb/>

<l rend="indent">But we might not compass it.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>Then my wild gaze sped far down the hall</l>
<l rend="indent">To the place of the hearthstone-sill;</l>
<l>And the Queen bent ever above the floor,</l>
<l rend="indent">For the plank was rising still.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>And now the rush was heard on the stair,</l>
<l rend="indent">And "God, what help?" was our cry.</l>
<l>And was I frenzied or was I bold?</l>
<l>I looked at each empty stanchion-hold,</l>
<l rend="indent">And no bar but my arm had I!</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>Like iron felt my arm, as through</l>
<l rend="indent">The staple I made it pass:</l>
<l>Alack! it was flesh and bone &mdash; no more!</l>
<l>'T was Catherine Douglas sprang to the door,</l>
<l rend="indent">But I fell back Kate Barlass.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>With that they all thronged into the hall,</l>
<l rend="indent">Half dim to my failing ken;</l>
<l>And the space that was but a void before</l>
<l rend="indent">Was a crowd of wrathful men.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>Behind the door I had fall'n and lay,</l>
<l rend="indent">Yet my sense was widely aware,</l>
<l>And for all the pain of my shattered arm</l>
<l rend="indent">I never fainted there.</l>
</lg>
<pb n="123" entity="b002082275_0148"/>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>Even as I fell, my eyes were cast</l>
<l rend="indent">Where the King leaped down to the pit;</l>
<l>And lo! the plank was smooth in its place,</l>
<l rend="indent">And the Queen stood far from it.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>And under the litters and through the bed</l>
<l rend="indent">And within the presses all</l>
<l>The traitors sought for the King, and pierced</l>
<l rend="indent">The arras around the wall.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>And through the chamber they ramped and stormed</l>
<l rend="indent">Like lions loose in the lair,</l>
<l>And scarce could trust to their very eyes &mdash;</l>
<l rend="indent">For behold! no King was there.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>Then one of them seized the Queen, and cried,</l>
<l rend="indent">"Now tells us, where is thy lord?"</l>
<l>And he held the sharp point over her heart:</l>
<l>She drooped not her eyes nor did she start,</l>
<l rend="indent">But she answered never a word.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>Then the sword half pierced the true true breast:</l>
<l rend="indent">But it was the Gr&aelig;me's own son</l>
<l>Cried, "This is a woman &mdash; we seek a man:"</l>
<l rend="indent">And away from her girdle-zone</l>
<l>He struck the point of the murderous steel;</l>
<l rend="indent">And that foul deed was not done.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>And forth flowed all the throng like a sea,</l>
<l rend="indent">And't was empty space once more;</l>
<l>And my eyes sought out the wounded Queen</l>
<l rend="indent">As I lay behind the door.</l>
</lg>
<pb n="124" entity="b002082275_0149"/>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>And I said: "Dear Lady, leave me here,</l>
<l rend="indent">For I cannot help you now;</l>
<l>But fly while you may, and none shall reck</l>
<l rend="indent">Of my place here lying low."</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>And she said, "My Catherine, God help thee!"</l>
<l rend="indent">Then she looked to the distant floor,</l>
<l>And elapsing her hands, "O God help <hi rend="italic">him</hi>,"</l>
<l rend="indent">She sobbed, "for we can no more!"</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>But God He knows what help may mean,</l>
<l rend="indent">If it mean to live or to die;</l>
<l>And what sore sorrow and mighty moan</l>
<l>On earth it may cost ere yet a throne</l>
<l rend="indent">Be filled in His house on high.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>And now the ladies fled with the Queen;</l>
<l rend="indent">And through the open door</l>
<l>The night-wind wailed round the empty room</l>
<l rend="indent">And the rushes shook on the floor.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>And the bed drooped low in the dark recess</l>
<l rend="indent">Whence the arras was rent away;</l>
<l>And the firelight still shone over the space</l>
<l rend="indent">Where our hidden secret lay.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>And the rain had ceased, and the moonbeams lit</l>
<l rend="indent">The window high in the wall &mdash;</l>
<l>Bright beams that on the plank that I knew</l>
<l rend="indent">Through the painted pane did fall</l>
<l>And gleamed with the splendour of Scotland's crown</l>
<l rend="indent">And shield armorial.</l>
</lg>
<pb n="125" entity="b002082275_0150"/>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>But then a great wind swept up the skies,</l>
<l rend="indent">And the climbing moon fell back;</l>
<l>And the royal blazon fled trom the floor,</l>
<l rend="indent">And naught remained on its track;</l>
<l>And high in the darkened window-pane</l>
<l rend="indent">The shield and the crown were black.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>And what I say next I partly saw</l>
<l rend="indent">And partly I heard in sooth,</l>
<l>And partly since from the murderers' lips</l>
<l rend="indent">The torture wrung the truth.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>For now again came the arm&egrave;d tread,</l>
<l rend="indent">And fast through the hall it fell;</l>
<l>But the throng was less: and ere I saw,</l>
<l rend="indent">By the voice without I could tell</l>
<l>That Robert Stuart had come with them</l>
<l rend="indent">Who knew that chamber well.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>And over the space the Gr&aelig;me strode dark</l>
<l rend="indent">With his mantle round him flung;</l>
<l>And in his eye was a flaming light</l>
<l rend="indent">But not a word on his tongue.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>And Stuart held a torch to the floor,</l>
<l rend="indent">And he found the thing he sought;</l>
<l>And they slashed the plank away with their swords;</l>
<l rend="indent">And O God! I fainted not!</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>And the traitor held his torch in the gap,</l>
<l rend="indent">All smoking and smouldering;</l>
<l>And through the vapour and fire, beneath</l>
<l rend="indent">In the dark crypt's narrow ring,</l>
<pb n="126" entity="b002082275_0151"/>
<l>With a shout that pealed to the room's high roof</l>
<l rend="indent">They saw their naked King.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>Half naked he stood, but stood as one</l>
<l rend="indent">Who yet could do and dare;</l>
<l>With the crown, the King was stript away &mdash;</l>
<l>The Knight was reft of his battle-array &mdash;</l>
<l rend="indent">But still the Man was there.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>From the rout then stepped a villain forth &mdash;</l>
<l rend="indent">Sir John Hall was his name:</l>
<l>With a knife unsheathed he leapt to the vault</l>
<l rend="indent">Beneath the torchlight-flame.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>Of his person and stature was the King</l>
<l rend="indent">A man right manly strong,</l>
<l>And mightily by the shoulderblades</l>
<l rend="indent">His foe to his feet he flung.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>Then the traitor's brother, Sir Thomas Hall,</l>
<l rend="indent">Sprang down to work his worst;</l>
<l>And the King caught the second man by the neck</l>
<l rend="indent">And flung him above the first.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>And he smote and trampled them under him;</l>
<l rend="indent">And a long month thence they bare</l>
<l>All black their throats with the grip of his hands</l>
<l rend="indent">When the hangman's hand came there.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>And sore he strove to have had their knives,</l>
<l rend="indent">But the sharp blades gashed his hands.</l>
<l>Oh James! so armed, thou hadst battled there</l>
<l rend="indent">Till help had come of thy bands;</l>
<pb n="127" entity="b002082275_0152"/>
<l>And oh! once more thou hadst held our throne</l>
<l rend="indent">And ruled thy Scotish lands!</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>But while the King o'er his foes still raged</l>
<l rend="indent">With a heart that naught could tame,</l>
<l>Another man sprange down to the crypt;</l>
<l>And with his sword in his hand hard-gripp'd,</l>
<l rend="indent">There stood Sir Robert Gr&aelig;me.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>&lpar;Now shame on the recreant traitor's heart</l>
<l rend="indent">Who durst not face his King</l>
<l>Till the body unarmed was wearied out</l>
<l rend="indent">With two-fold combating!</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>Ah! well might the people sing and say,</l>
<l rend="indent">As oft ye have heard aright:</l>
<l><hi rend="italic">"O Robert Gr&aelig;me, O Robert Gr&aelig;me,</hi></l>
<l><hi rend="italic">Who slew our King, God give thee shame!"</hi></l>
<l rend="indent">For he slew him not as a knight.&rpar;</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>And the naked King turned round at bay,</l>
<l rend="indent">But his strength had passed the goal,</l>
<l>And he could but gasp: "Mine hour is come;</l>
<l>But oh! to succour thine own soul's doom,</l>
<l rend="indent">Let a priest now shrive my soul!"</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>And the traitor looked on the King's spent strength</l>
<l rend="indent">And said: "Have I kept my word?</l>
<l>Yea, King, the mortal pledge that I gave?</l>
<l>No black friar's shrift thy soul shall have,</l>
<l rend="indent">But the shrift of this red sword!"</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>With that he smote his King through the breast;</l>
<l rend="indent">And all they three in the pen</l>
<pb n="128" entity="b002082275_0153"/>
<l>Fell on him and stabbed and stabbed him there</l>
<l rend="indent">Like merciless murderous men</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>Yet seemed it now that Sir Robert Gr&aelig;me,</l>
<l rend="indent">Ere the King's last breath was o'er,</l>
<l>Turned sick at heart with the deadly sight</l>
<l rend="indent">And would have done no more.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>But a cry came from the troop above;</l>
<l rend="indent">"If him thou do not slay,</l>
<l>The price of his life that thou dost spare</l>

</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>O God! what more did I hear or see,</l>
<l rend="indent">Or how should I tell the rest?</l>
<l>But there at length our King lay slain</l>
<l rend="indent">With sixteen wounds in his breast.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>O God! and now did a bell boom forth,</l>
<l rend="indent">And the murderers turned and fled;</l>
<l>Too late, too late, O God, did it sound!</l>
<l>And I heard the true men mustering round,</l>
<l rend="indent">And the cries and the coming tread.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>But ere they came, to the black death-gap</l>
<l rend="indent">Somewise did I creep and steal;</l>
<l>And lo! or ever I swooned away,</l>

<l rend="indent">In the Pit of Fortune's Wheel.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>And now, ye Scotish maids who have heard</l>
<l rend="indent">Dread things of the days grown old &mdash;</l>
<l>Even at the last, of true Queen Jane</l>
<l rend="indent">May somewhat yet be told,</l>
<pb n="129" entity="b002082275_0154"/>
<l>And how she dealt for her dear Lord's sake</l>
<l rend="indent">Dire vengeance manifold.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>'T was in the Charterhouse of Perth,</l>
<l rend="indent">In the fair-lit Death-chapelle,</l>
<l>That the slain King's corpse on bier was laid</l>
<l rend="indent">With chaunt and requiem-knell.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>And all with royal wealth of balm</l>
<l rend="indent">Was the body purified;</l>
<l>And none could trace on the brow and lips</l>
<l rend="indent">The death that he had died.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>In his robes of state he lay asleep</l>
<l rend="indent">With orb and sceptre in hand;</l>
<l>And by the crown he wore on his throne</l>
<l rend="indent">Was his kingly forehead spann'd.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>And, girls, 't was a sweet sad thing to see</l>
<l rend="indent">How the curling golden hair,</l>
<l>As in the day of the poet's youth,</l>
<l rend="indent">From the King's crown clustered there.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>And if all had come to pass in the brain</l>
<l rend="indent">That throbbed beneath those curls,</l>
<l>Then Scots had said in the days to come</l>
<l>That this their soil was a different home</l>
<l rend="indent">And a different Scotland, girls!</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>And the Queen sat by him night and day.</l>
<l rend="indent">And oft she knelt in prayer,</l>
<l>All wan and pale in the widow's veil</l>
<l rend="indent">That shrouded her shining hair.</l>
</lg>
<pb n="130" entity="b002082275_0155"/>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>And I had got good help of my hurt:</l>
<l rend="indent">And only to me some sign</l>
<l>She made; and save the priests that were there</l>
<l rend="indent">No face would she see but mine.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>And the month of March wore on apace;</l>
<l rend="indent">And now fresh couriers fared</l>
<l>Still from the country of the Wild Scots</l>
<l rend="indent">With news of the traitors snared.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>And still, as I told her day by day,</l>
<l rend="indent">Her pallor changed to sight,</l>
<l>And the frost grew to a furnace-flame</l>
<l rend="indent">That burnt her visage white.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>And evermore as I brought her word,</l>
<l rend="indent">She bent to her dead King James,</l>
<l>And in the cold ear with fire-drawn breath</l>
<l rend="indent">She spoke the traitors' names.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>But when the name of Sir Robert Gr&aelig;me</l>
<l rend="indent">Was the one she had to give,</l>
<l>I ran to hold her up from the floor;</l>
<l>For the froth was on her lips, and sore</l>
<l rend="indent">I feared that she could not live.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>And the month of March wore nigh to its end,</l>
<l rend="indent">And still was the death-pall spread;</l>
<l>For she would not bury her slaughtered lord</l>
<l rend="indent">Till his slayers all were dead.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>And now of their dooms dread tidings came,</l>
<l rend="indent">And of torments fierce and dire:</l>
<pb n="131" entity="b002082275_0156"/>
<l>And naught she spake &mdash; she had ceased to speak &mdash;</l>
<l rend="indent">But her eyes were a soul on fire.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>But when I told her the bitter end</l>
<l rend="indent">Of the stern and just award,</l>
<l>She leaned o'er the bier, and thrice three times</l>
<l rend="indent">She kissed the lips of her lord.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>And then she said, "My King, they are dead!"</l>
<l rend="indent">And she knelt on the chapel floor,</l>
<l>And whispered low with a strange proud smile,</l>
<l rend="indent">"James, James, they suffered more!"</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>Last she stood up to her queenly height,</l>
<l rend="indent">But she shook like an autumn leaf,</l>
<l>As though the fire wherein she burned</l>
<l>Then left her body, and all were turned</l>
<l rend="indent">To winter of life-long grief.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>And "O James!" she said, "My James!" she said,</l>
<l rend="indent">"Alas for the woeful thing,</l>
<l>That a poet true and a friend of man,</l>
<l>In desperate days of bale and ban,</l>
<l rend="indent">Should needs be born a King!"</l>

</epigraph>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">When</hi> the hapless daughter of Dudley, Duke of <lb/>
Northumberland, offered up her fair young <lb/>
life upon the scaffold at Tower Hill she was still in her <lb/>
"teens" &mdash; with the simplicity and freshness of girlhood <lb/>
upon her. There is a tender and pathetic beauty about <lb/>
the tragic talc which no repetition can wholly dim or <lb/>
wear off.</p>
<p>The reader needs not to be told that she was the <lb/>
eldest daughter of Henry Grey, third Marquis of Dorset. <lb/>
She was allied with royal blood, her mother being <lb/>
Frances the eldest daughter of Charles Brandon, Duke <lb/>
of Suffolk, and Mary Tudor, second daughter of Henry <lb/>
VII. She came also of royal stock on the father's side.</p>
<p>It is a curious fact that the date of the birth of this <lb/>
lady is not exactly known; but, according to Fuller, it <lb/>
<pb n="133" entity="b002082275_0158"/>
took place in 1536, at her father's stately mansion, of <lb/>
Bradgate, near Leicester. She was the eldest of three <lb/>
daughters, Jane, Katherine and Mary. At a very early <lb/>
age her budding gifts gave abundant promise of a fair <lb/>
womanhood; so serene her temper and so remarkable <lb/>
her love of knowledge. She was fortunate in living at a <lb/>
time when the education of women was as <reg orig="comprehen-|sive">comprehensive</reg><lb/>
and exact as that of men; and her father provided <lb/>
her with two learned tutors in his two chaplains, Thomas <lb/>
Harding and John Aylmer. To the latter she seems to <lb/>
have been more particularly given in charge; and the <lb/>
teacher being as zealous as the pupil was diligent, Lady <lb/>
Jane soon gained a thorough acquaintance with Latin <lb/>
and Greek, and also some degree of proficiency in <lb/>
Hebrew, Arabic, Chaldaic, French and Italian.</p>
<p>These grave and serious studies were relieved by a <lb/>
cultivation of the graces. Her voice was melodious, <lb/>
and she sang with much skill and expression; she also <lb/>
played on various musical instruments. Her <reg orig="needle-|work">needlework</reg> <lb/>
and embroidery excited the admiration of her <lb/>
contemporaries; she acquired a knowledge of the <reg orig="medi-|cal">medical</reg> <lb/>
properties of herbs; dainty dishes, preserves, and <lb/>
"sweet waters" she concocted with dexterous hand; her <lb/>
caligraphy was a marvel of ease and elegance; in this <lb/>
last-named art she was instructed by the erudite Roger <lb/>
Ascham, who was one of its most famous professors.</p>
<p>Thus it happened that even in her early girlhood she <lb/>
surpassed in general scholarship her equals in age. But <lb/>
her tutors did not forget the spiritual side of her <reg orig="educa-|tion">education</reg>, <lb/>
and she was well grounded in the dogmas of the <lb/>
Church as well as in the truths and lessons embodied <lb/>
in the life and teaching of her Lord.</p>
<p>After the death of Henry VIII. Lady Jane went <lb/>
<pb n="134" entity="b002082275_0159"/>
to reside with the widowed Queen, Katherine Parr, at <lb/>
Chelsea; and when that lady married Lord Seymour of <lb/>
Dudley, she accompanied them to Hanworth, in <reg orig="Middle-|sex">Middlesex</reg>, <lb/>
a palace which Henry VIII. had bestowed upon <lb/>
Queen Katherine in dower. The Queen did not long <lb/>
survive her second nuptials, but died at Dudley Castle, <lb/>
September 5, 1548, in the thirty-sixth year of her age. <lb/>
Lady Jane acted as chief mourner at the funeral.</p>
<p>It was soon after this event that Lady Jane addressed <lb/>
the following letter to the Lord High Admiral. As the <lb/>
composition of a girl of twelve it shows no ordinary <lb/>
promise: &mdash;</p>

<p>My duty to your lordship, in most humble wise remembered, <lb/>
with no less thanks for the gentle letters which I received from you. <lb/>
Thinking myself so much bound to your lordship for your great <lb/>
goodness towards me from time to time, that I cannot by any <lb/>
means be able to recompense the least part thereof, I purposed to <lb/>
write a few rude lines unto your lordship, rather as a token to <lb/>
show how much worthier I think your lordship's goodness than <lb/>
to give worthy thanks for the same; and these my letters shall be <lb/>
to testify unto you that, like as you have become towards me a <lb/>
loving and kind father, so I shall be always most ready to obey <lb/>
your godly monitions and good instructions, as becometh one upon <lb/>
whom you have heaped so many benefits. And thus, fearing lest <lb/>
I should trouble your lordship too much, I must humbly take my <lb/>
leave of your good lordship.</p>

<p>It is not impossible that at Bradgate Lady Jane may <lb/>
have regretted the indulgent ease and splendid <reg orig="hospi-|tality">hospitality</reg> <lb/>
of Dudley Castle. Her parents acted upon the <lb/>
maxim that to spare the rod is to spoil the child; and <lb/>
notwithstanding her amiability and honourable dili-, <lb/>
gence, subjected her to a very severe discipline. She <lb/>
<pb n="135" entity="b002082275_0160"/>
was rigorously punished for the slightest defect in her <lb/>
behaviour or the most trivial failure in her studies. Her <lb/>
parents taught her to fear, rather than to love, them; and <lb/>
insisted upon reverence, rather than affection, as the <lb/>
duty of children. It is no wonder, therefore, that from <lb/>
the austere brow and unsympathetic voice she turned <lb/>
with ever-increasing delight towards that secret spirit of <lb/>
knowledge which has only smiles for its votaries.</p>
<p>In the pages of the wise she met with divine words of <lb/>
encouragement and consolation; they soothed her <reg orig="sor-|rows">sorrows</reg>, <lb/>
they taught her the heroism of endurance, they <lb/>
lifted her into that serene realm where dwelt the <reg orig="Im-|mortals&mdash;the">Immortals&mdash;the</reg> <lb/>
glorious minds of old. "Thus," says she, <lb/>
"my book hath been so much my pleasure, and bringeth <lb/>
daily to me more and more pleasure, that in respect of <lb/>
it all other pleasures in very deed be but trifles and <lb/>
troubles unto me."</p>
<p>From an interesting passage in Roger Ascham's <lb/>
"Schoolmaster," we can form some idea of the <reg orig="melan-|choly">melancholy</reg> <lb/>
girlhood of this daughter of a royal race. Ascham <lb/>
visited Bradgate in the summer of 1550 on his way to <lb/>
London. He found, on his arrival, the stately mansion <lb/>
deserted; the Lord and Lady, with all their household, <lb/>
were hunting merrily in the park to the music of horn <lb/>
and hound. Making his way through the deserted <lb/>
chambers, he came at length upon a secluded <reg orig="apart-|ment">apartment</reg>, <lb/>
where the fair Lady Jane was calmly studying <lb/>
the pages of Plato's immortal "Ph&aelig;don" in the original <lb/>
Greek. Surprised and delighted by a spectacle so <lb/>
unusual, the worthy scholar, after the usual salutations, <lb/>
inquired why she had not accompanied the gay lords <lb/>
and ladies in the park, to enjoy the pastime of the chase.</p>
<p>"I wis," she replied, smiling, "all their sport in the <lb/>
<pb n="136" entity="b002082275_0161"/>
park is but a shadow to that pleasure that I find in Plato. <lb/>
Alas! good folk, they never felt what true pleasure <lb/>
meant."</p>
<p>"And how came you, madam," quoth he, "to this <lb/>
deep knowledge of pleasure? And what did chiefly <lb/>
allure you unto it, seeing not many women, but very <lb/>
few men, have attained thereunto?"</p>
<p>"I will tell you," quoth she, "and tell you a truth <lb/>
which, perchance, ye will marvel at. One of the <lb/>
greatest benefits that ever God gave me is that He <lb/>
sent me so sharp and severe parents and so gentle a <lb/>
schoolmaster. For when I am in presence either of <lb/>
father or mother, whether I speak, keep silence, sit, <lb/>
stand, or go, eat, drink, be merry or sad, be sewing, <lb/>
playing, dancing or doing anything else, I must do it, <lb/>
as it were, in such weight, measure and number, even <lb/>
so perfectly as God made the world, or else I am so <lb/>
sharply taunted, so cruelly threatened, yea, presently, <lb/>
sometimes with pinches, nips and bobs, and other ways <lb/>
which I will not name for the honour I bear them, so <lb/>
without reason misordered, that I think myself in hell <lb/>
till time come that I must go to Mr. Aylmer; who <lb/>
teacheth me so gently, so pleasantly, with such fair <lb/>
allurements to learning, that I think all the time nothing <lb/>
whiles I am with him. And when I am called from <lb/>
him, I fall on weeping, because, whatever I do else but <lb/>
learning is full of grief, trouble, fear and whole <reg orig="mis-|liking">misliking</reg> <lb/>
unto me."</p>
<p>Ascham did not see her again after this memorable <lb/>
interview. "I remember this talk gladly," he wrote, <lb/>
"both because it is so worthy of memory and because <lb/>
also it was the last talk that ever I had and the last <lb/>
time that ever I saw that noble and worthy lady."</p>
<pb n="137" entity="b002082275_0162"/>
<p>In his letters to his learned friends, however, he <reg orig="fre-|quently">frequently</reg> <lb/>
commented on the sweetness of her character and <lb/>
the depth of her erudition. He spoke of Lady Mildred <lb/>
Cooke and the Lady Jane Grey as the two most learned <lb/>
women in England; and summed up his praises of the <lb/>
latter in the remark that "however illustrious she was <lb/>
by her fortune and royal extraction, this bore no <reg orig="pro-|portion">proportion</reg> <lb/>
to the accomplishments of her mind, adorned <lb/>
with the doctrine of Plato and the eloquence of <reg orig="Demos-|thenes">Demosthenes</reg>."</p>
<p>Her illustrious rank, her piety and her erudition <lb/>
necessarily made the Lady Jane an object of special <lb/>
interest to the leaders of the Reformed Church in <reg orig="Eng-|land">England</reg> <lb/>
and on the continent. The learned Martin Bruce, <lb/>
whom Edward VI. had appointed to the chair of divinity <lb/>
at the University of Cambridge, watched over her with <lb/>
prayerful anxiety. Bullinger, a minister of Zurich, <lb/>
corresponded with her frequently, encouraging her in <lb/>
the practice of every virtue. Under the direction and <lb/>
counsel of these and other divines she pursued her <lb/>
theological studies with great success, so as to be able to <lb/>
defend and maintain the creed she had adopted, and <lb/>
give abundant reason for the faith that was in her.</p>
<p>The Marquis of Dorset, in October, 1551, was raised <lb/>
to the dukedom of Suffolk; and on the same day the <lb/>
subtle and ambitious intriguer, John Dudley, Earl of <lb/>
Warwick, who was to exercise so malignant an <reg orig="influ-|ence">influence</reg> <lb/>
on his daughter's destiny, was created Duke of <lb/>
Northumberland.</p>
<p>The Lady Jane was then removed to the metropolis, <lb/>
residing with her family at her father's town house, in <lb/>
Suffolk Place. She necessarily shared in the festivities <lb/>
of the court; but she would seem to have been <reg orig="distin-|guished">distinguished</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="138" entity="b002082275_0163"/>
always by a remarkable plainness of apparel; <lb/>
in this obeying the impulse of her simplicity of taste, <lb/>
supported and confirmed by the advice of Bullinger <lb/>
and Aylmer.</p>
<p>On one occasion the Princess Mary presented her <lb/>
with a sumptuous robe, which she was desired to wear <lb/>
in recognition of the donor's generosity. "Nay," she <lb/>
replied, "that were a shame, to follow my Lady <lb/>
Mary, who leaveth God's word, and leave my Lady <lb/>
Elizabeth who followeth God's word." A speech <lb/>
which the Lady Mary doubtless remembered.</p>
<p>Early in 1553, men clearly saw that the life and reign <lb/>
of Edward VI. were drawing to an abrupt termination. <lb/>
His legitimate successor was his elder sister Mary; but <lb/>
her morose temper and bigoted attachment to the old <lb/>
Church had filled the minds of the Reformers with <lb/>
anxiety. Her unpopularity, and the dangers to the <lb/>
Reformed Church to be apprehended from her <reg orig="acces-|sion">accession</reg>, <lb/>
led Dudley, Duke of Northumberland, to <reg orig="con-|ceive">conceive</reg> <lb/>
an audacious design. He resolved to raise his <lb/>
son to the throne. But for this purpose it was <reg orig="neces-|sary">necessary</reg> <lb/>
to ally him to the blood-royal, and he therefore <lb/>
planned a marriage between his young son, Lord <reg orig="Guil-|ford">Guilford</reg> <lb/>
Dudley, and Lady Jane Grey.</p>
<p>There were such elements of fitness in the match that <lb/>
on neither side was any obstruction thrown; and in <lb/>
June 1553 the bridal ceremony took place at the Duke <lb/>
of Northumberland's palace in the Strand. The Duke <lb/>
then obtained from King Edward, by an appeal to his <lb/>
zeal for the Church, letters-patent excluding Mary <lb/>
and Elizabeth from the succession and declaring Lady <lb/>
Jane Grey heir to the throne.</p>
<p>A few days afterwards the young king died; and on <lb/>
<pb n="139" entity="b002082275_0164"/>
the evening of the 9th of July, the Duke of <reg orig="Northum-|berland">Northumberland</reg>, <lb/>
accompanied by the Marquis of Northampton, <lb/>
the Earls of Arundel, Huntingdon and Pembroke, <reg orig="ap-|peared">appeared</reg> <lb/>
before the young bride in her quiet chamber at <lb/>
Northumberland House, and urged her acceptance of a <lb/>
crown which was fated to become, for her, a crown of <lb/>
thorns.</p>
<p>"How I was beside myself," she afterwards wrote, <lb/>
"how I was beside myself, stupefied and troubled, I <lb/>
will leave it to those lords who were present to testify, <lb/>
who saw me overcome by sudden and unexpected grief, <lb/>
fall on the ground, weeping very bitterly; and then <reg orig="declar-|ing">declaring</reg> <lb/>
to them my insufficiency, I greatly bewailed myself for <lb/>
the death of so noble a Prince, and at the same timeturned <lb/>
myself to God, humbly praying and beseeching Him <lb/>
that if what was given to me was <hi rend="italic">rightly and lawjully</hi> <lb/>
mine, His divine Majesty would grant <hi rend="italic">me</hi> such grace and <lb/>
spirit that I might govern it to His glory and service <lb/>
and to the advantage of this realm."</p>
<p>Her prudent reluctance, however, was overruled. <lb/>
History records the brief twelve days' pageant of her <lb/>
reign.</p>
<p>On the 19th of July her opponent, Mary entered <reg orig="Lon-|don">London</reg> <lb/>
in triumph.</p>
<p>"Great was the rejoicing," says a contemporary; so <lb/>
great that the like of it had never been seen by any living. <lb/>
The number of caps that were flung into the air at the <lb/>
proclamation could not be told. The Earl of Pembroke <lb/>
cast among the crowd a liberal largess. Bonfires blazed <lb/>
in every street; and what with shouting and crying of <lb/>
the people, and ringing of bells, there could no one man <lb/>
hear what another said.</p>
<p>Lady Jane was at first confined in the house of one <lb/>
<pb n="140" entity="b002082275_0165"/>
Partridge, a warder of the Tower. Thence, after she and <lb/>
her husband had been tried for high treason and found <lb/>
guilty, they were removed to the Tower. During her <lb/>
captivity she occasionally amused herself with the <reg orig="grace-|ful">graceful</reg> <lb/>
pursuits of her earlier and happier years, engraving on <lb/>
the walls of her prison, with a pin, some Latin distich, <lb/>
which turned into English read: <lb/>
<q><lg type="stanza">
<l>"Believe not, man, in care's despite,</l>

</lg></q></p>
<p>Her execution was fixed for the 12th of February <lb/>
1554. On the night preceding she wrote a few <reg orig="sen-|tences">sentences</reg> <lb/>
of advice to her sister on the blank leaf of a New <lb/>
Testament. To her father she addressed the following <lb/>
beautiful letter, in which filial reverence softens and <lb/>
subdues the exhortations of a dying saint:</p>

<p>The stern Lieutenant of the Tower, Sir John Brydges, <lb/>
had been vanquished by the gentle graces of his prisoner <lb/>
and he sought from her some memorial in writing. In a <lb/>

of farewell:</p>

<p>Mary and her advisers had originally intended that <lb/>
both Lady Jane and her husband should be executed <lb/>
together on Tower Hill; but reflection convinced them <lb/>
that the spectacle of so comely and youthful a pair <lb/>
suffering for what was rather the crime of others than <lb/>
their own, might powerfully awaken the sympathies of <lb/>
the multitude, and produce a revulsion of feeling. It <lb/>
was ordered, therefore, that Lady Jane should suffer <lb/>
within the precincts of the Tower.</p>
<p>The fatal morning came. The young husband&mdash;still <lb/>
a bridegroom and a lover &mdash; had obtained permission to <lb/>
bid her a last farewell; but she refused to see him, <reg orig="ap-|prehensive">apprehensive</reg> <lb/>
that so bitter a parting might overwhelm <lb/>
them, and deprive them of the courage needful to face <lb/>
death with calmness. She sent him, however, many <lb/>
loving messages, reminding him how brief would be their <lb/>
separation, and how quickly they would meet in a <lb/>
brighter and better world.</p>
<p>In going to his death on Tower Hill, he passed beneath <lb/>
the window of her cell; so that they had an opportunity <lb/>
<pb n="142" entity="b002082275_0167"/>
of exchanging a farewell look. He behaved on the <lb/>
scaffold with calm intrepidity. After spending a brief <lb/>
space in silent devotion, he requested the prayers of the <lb/>
spectators, and, laying his head upon the block, gave the <lb/>
fatal signal. At one blow his head was severed from <lb/>
his body.</p>
<p>The scaffold on which the girl-queen was to close her <lb/>
stainless career had been erected on the green opposite <lb/>
the White Tower. As soon as her husband was dead <lb/>
the officers announced that the sheriffs waited to attend <lb/>
her thither. And when she had gone down and been <lb/>
delivered into their hands, the bystanders noted in her <lb/>
"a countenance so gravely settled and with all modest <lb/>
and comely resolution, that not the least symptom either <lb/>
of fear or grief could be perceived either in her <lb/>
speech or motions; she was like one going to be united <lb/>
to her heart's best and longest beloved."</p>
<p>So, like a martyr, crowned with glory, she went unto <lb/>
her death. Her serene composure was scarcely shaken <lb/>
when, through an unfortunate misunderstanding of <lb/>
the officer in command, she met on her way her <lb/>
husband's headless trunk being borne to its last <reg orig="resting-|place">resting-place</reg>.</p>
<p>"Oh Guilford! Guilford!" she exclaimed; "the <reg orig="ante-|past">ante-past</reg> <lb/>
is not so bitter that you have tasted, and that I <lb/>
shall soon taste, as to make my flesh tremble; it is nothing <lb/>
compared to the feast that you and I shall this day <reg orig="par-|take">partake</reg> <lb/>
of in heaven." This thought renewed her strength <lb/>
and sustained and consoled, we might almost believe, by <lb/>
ministering angels, she proceeded to the scaffold with as <lb/>
much grace and dignity as if it were a wedding banquet <lb/>
that awaited her.</p>
<p>She was conducted by Sir John Brydges, the <reg orig="Lieu-|tenant">Lieutenant</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="143" entity="b002082275_0168"/>
of the Tower, and attended by her two <reg orig="waiting-|women">waiting-women</reg>, <lb/>
Mrs. Elizabeth Tylney and Mrs. Ellen. While <lb/>
these wept and sobbed bitterly, her eyes were dry, and <lb/>
her countenance shone with the light of a sure and <lb/>
certain hope. She read earnestly her manual of prayers. <lb/>
On reaching the place of execution she saluted the lords <lb/>
and gentlemen present with unshaken composure and <lb/>
infinite grace. No minister of her own Church had been <lb/>
allowed to attend her, and she did not care to accept <lb/>
the services of Feckenham, Queen Mary's confessor. <lb/>
She was not indifferent, however, to his respectful <reg orig="sym-|pathy">sympathy</reg> <lb/>
and when bidding him farewell, she said:</p>
<p>"Go now; God grant you all your desires, and accept <lb/>
my own warm thanks for your attentions to me; <reg orig="al-|though">although</reg>, <lb/>
indeed, those attentions have tried me more than <lb/>
death could now terrify me."</p>
<p>To the spectators she addressed a few gentle words, in <lb/>
admirable keeping with the gentle tenor of her life.</p>
<p>"Good people," she exclaimed, "I am come hither <lb/>
to die, and by law I am condemned to the same. My <lb/>
offence to the Queen's Highness was only in consent to <lb/>
the device of others, which now is deemed treason; but <lb/>
it was never my seeking, but by counsel of those who <lb/>
should seem to have further understanding of things than <lb/>
I, who knew little of the law, and much less of the titles <lb/>
to the Crown. I pray you all, good Christian people, <lb/>
to bear me witness that I die a true Christian woman, <lb/>
and that I look to be saved by none other means but only <lb/>
by the mercy of God, in the merits of the blood of His <lb/>
only son, Jesus Christ; and I confess, when I did know <lb/>
the word of God, I neglected the same, loved myself and <lb/>
the world, and therefore this plague or punishment is <lb/>
happily and worthily happened unto me for my sins; <lb/>
<pb n="144" entity="b002082275_0169"/>
and yet I thank God of His goodness, that He hath thus <lb/>
given me a time and respite to repent. And now, good <lb/>
people, while I am alive, I pray you to assist me with <lb/>
your prayers."</p>
<p>She knelt to her devotions, and turning to Feckenham, <lb/>
inquired whether she should repeat the Miserere psalm <lb/>
&lpar;the fifty-first, "Have mercy upon me, O Lord"&rpar;.</p>
<p>He replied in the affirmative; and she said it with <lb/>
great earnestness from beginning to end. Rising from <lb/>
her knees, she began to prepare herself for the headsman <lb/>
and pulling off her gloves, gave them and her <reg orig="handker-|chief">handkerchief</reg> <lb/>
to Mistress Tylney. The manual of prayers, in <lb/>
which she had written at the desire of the Lieutenant, she <lb/>
handed to Thomas Brydges, his brother. When she <lb/>
was unfastening her robe, the executioner would have <lb/>
assisted her, but she motioned him aside, and accepted <lb/>
the last offices of her waiting-women, who then gave her <lb/>
a white handkerchief with which to bandage her eyes.</p>
<p>Throwing himself at her feet, the headsman humbly <lb/>
craved her forgiveness, which she willingly granted. He <lb/>
then requested her to stand upon the straw, and in <reg orig="com-|plying">complying</reg> <lb/>
with his direction she for the first time saw the <lb/>
fatal block. Her composure remained unshaken; she <lb/>
simply entreated the executioner to dispatch her quickly. <lb/>
Again kneeling she asked him:</p>
<p>"Will you take it off before I lay me down?"</p>
<p>"No, madam," he replied.</p>
<p>She bound the handkerchief round her eyes, and <reg orig="feel-|ing">feeling</reg> <lb/>
for the block, exclaimed,</p>
<p>"What shall I do? Where is it?"</p>
<p>Being guided to it by one of the bystanders, she laid <lb/>
her head down, exclaiming, in an audible voice:</p>
<p>"Lord, into thy hands I commend my spirit."</p>
<pb n="145" entity="b002082275_0170"/>
<p>In an instant the axe fell, and the tragedy was <reg orig="con-|summated">consummated</reg>. <lb/>
An involuntary groan from the assembled <lb/>
multitude seemed to acknowledge that vengeance had <lb/>
been satisfied, but justice outraged.</p>
<p>Lady Jane &mdash; or Queen Jane, as she should more <reg orig="prop-|perly">propperly</reg> <lb/>
be called &mdash; was little more than seventeen years <lb/>
old when she thus fell a victim to Mary's jealous fears <lb/>
and hate. She had hardly entered upon womanhood, <lb/>
and the promise of her young life had had no time to ripen <lb/>
into fruition. We may well believe, however, that she <lb/>
would not have disappointed the hopes which that <lb/>
promise had awakened. Her heroic death showed how <lb/>
well she had profited by the lessons she had imbibed in <lb/>
her early years.</p>
<p>There was no affectation, no exaggeration, in her <reg orig="con-|duct">conduct</reg> <lb/>
upon the scaffold; but she bore herself with serene <lb/>
dignity and with true courage. It was worthy of her <lb/>
life &mdash; which, brief as an unhappy fortune made it, was <lb/>
full of beauty, full of calmness, and truth, and elevation <lb/>
and modest piety. The impression which it made upon <lb/>
her contemporaries, an impression taken up and <reg orig="re-|tained">retained</reg> <lb/>
by posterity, is visible in the fact to this hour we <lb/>
speak of her as she was in her sweet simple maidenhood &mdash; <lb/>
we pass over her married name and her regal title, and <lb/>
love to honour her, not as Lady Jane Dudley, or Queen <lb/>
Jane, but as Lady Jane Grey.</p>

<head><hi rend="bold">VIII <lb/>
POCAHONTAS</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">In his</hi> younger days Powhatan had been a great <lb/>
warrior. He was the chief, or <hi rend="italic">werowance,</hi> of eight <lb/>
tribes. Through conquest his dominions had been <reg orig="ex-|tended">extended</reg> <lb/>
until they reached from the James River to the <lb/>
Potomac, from the sea to the falls in the rivers, and <reg orig="in-|cluded">included</reg> <lb/>
thirty of the forty tribes in Virginia. It is <reg orig="esti-|mated">estimated</reg> <lb/>
that his subjects numbered eight thousand. The <lb/>
name of his nation and the Indian name of the James <lb/>
River was Powhatan. His enemies were two <reg orig="neighbour-|ing">neighbouring</reg> <lb/>
confederacies, the Mannahoacs, between the <reg orig="Rap-|pahannock">Rappahannock</reg> <lb/>
and York rivers, and the Monacans between <lb/>
the York and James rivers, above the falls.</p>
<p>Powhatan lived sometimes at a village of his name, <lb/>
where Richmond now stands, and sometimes at <reg orig="Werowo-|comoco">Werowocomoco</reg>, <lb/>
on the York River. He had in each of his <reg orig="heredi-|tary">hereditary</reg> <lb/>
villages a house built like a long arbour for his <lb/>
especial reception. When Powhatan visited one of these <lb/>
villages a feast was already spread in the long house or <lb/>
arbour. He had a hunting town in the wilderness called <lb/>
Orapax. A mile from this place, deep in the woods, he <lb/>
had another arbour-like house, where he kept furs, copper, <lb/>
pearls, and beads, treasures which he was saving against <lb/>
his burial.</p>
<p>Powhatan had twenty sons and eleven daughters <reg orig="liv-|ing">living</reg>. <lb/>
We know nothing of his sons except Nanteguas, <lb/>
"the most manliest, comeliest, boldest spirit" ever seen <lb/>
<pb n="147" entity="b002082275_0172"/>
in "a savage." Pocahontas was Powhatan's favourite <lb/>
daughter. She was born in 1594 or 1595. Of her mother <lb/>
nothing is known. Powhatan had many wives; when <lb/>
he tired of them he would present them to those of his <lb/>
subjects whom he considered the most deserving.</p>
<p>Indians are frequently known by several names. It <lb/>
is a disappointment to learn that the name which the <lb/>
romantic story of this Indian princess has made so <lb/>
famous was not her real name. She was called in <reg orig="child-|hood">childhood</reg> <lb/>
Metoax, or Metoake. Concealing this from the <lb/>
English, because of a superstitious notion that if these <lb/>
pale-faced strangers knew her true name they could <lb/>
do her some harm, the Indians gave her name as <lb/>
Pocahontas.</p>
<p>Powhatan's authority, like that of all Indian chiefs, <lb/>
was held in check by custom. "The lawes whereby he <lb/>
ruleth," says Captain Smith, "is custome. Yet when he <lb/>
listeth, his will is a law, and must be obeyed: not only as <lb/>
a king, but as halfe a god they esteeme him."</p>
<p>Each village and tribe had its respective chief, or <lb/>
"werowance," as he was called among the Powhatan <lb/>
Indians. The affairs of the tribe were settled in a council <lb/>
of the chiefs and warriors of the several villages.</p>
<p>Powhatan was the great werowance over all, "unto <lb/>
whom," says Captain Smith, "they pay tribute of skinnes, <lb/>
beads, copper, pearle, deere, turkies, wild beasts, and <lb/>
corne. What he commandeth they dare not disobey in <lb/>
the least thing. It is strange to see with what care and <lb/>
adoration all these people do obey this Powhatan. For <lb/>
at his feete they present whatsoever he commandeth, and <lb/>
at the least frown of his brow, their greatest spirits will <lb/>
tremble! and no marvell, for he is very terrible and <reg orig="tyran-|nous">tyrannous</reg> <lb/>
in punishing such as offend him."</p>
<pb n="148" entity="b002082275_0173"/>
<p>It was a barbarous life in which the little Pocahontas <lb/>
was bred. Her people always washed their young babies <lb/>
in the river on the coldest mornings to harden them. <lb/>
She was accustomed to see her old father sitting <lb/>
at the door of his cabin regarding with grim pleasure <lb/>
a string of his enemy's scalps, suspended from tree <lb/>
to tree, and waving in the breeze. Men in England <lb/>
in her time idealised her into a princess and fine <lb/>
lady. In our time historians have been surprised and <lb/>
indignant at finding that she was not a heroine of <lb/>
romance, but simply an Indian maiden. Such as <lb/>
her life made her she was &mdash; in her manners an <reg orig="un-|trained">untrained</reg> <lb/>
savage. But she was also the steadfast friend <lb/>
and helper of the feeble colony, and that is why her <lb/>
life is heroic and full of interest.</p>
<p>Powhatan, sensible of the pomp and dignity proper to <lb/>
his position as a great warrior, particularly desired to <lb/>
impress the English who were settling at Jamestown. A <lb/>
member of the colony, Captain Smith had been prisoner <lb/>
for several weeks and was detained until preparations had <lb/>
been made to receive him in state.</p>
<p>When Powhatan and his train had had time to deck <lb/>
themselves in all "their greatest braveries," Captain <lb/>
Smith was admitted to the chief's presence. He was <lb/>
seated upon a sort of divan resembling a bedstead. <reg orig="Be-|fore">Before</reg> <lb/>
him was a fire, and on either hand sat two young <lb/>
women about eighteen years of age. Powhatan, "well <lb/>
beaten with many cold and stormy winters," wore strings <lb/>
of pearls around his neck, and was covered with a great <lb/>
robe of raccoon skins decorated with the tails. Around <lb/>
the council house was ranged a double row of warriors. <lb/>
Behind these were as many women. The heads and <lb/>
shoulders of the Indians were painted red, many had <lb/>
<pb n="149" entity="b002082275_0174"/>
their hair decorated with white down, and all wore some <lb/>
savage ornament.</p>
<p>On the appearance of the prisoner a great shout arose <lb/>
from these primitive courtiers. An Indian woman was <lb/>
appointed to bring water for the prisoner to wash <lb/>
his hands in. Another woman brought him feathers to <lb/>
dry them and Captain Smith was then feasted in the <lb/>
"best barbarous manner," and a council was held to <lb/>
decide his fate. This debate lasted a long time, but the <lb/>
conclusion could hardly have been favourable to Captain <lb/>
Smith, since Powhatan was jealous of the white colony <lb/>
already encroaching upon his seclusion at <reg orig="Werowoco-|moco">Werowocomoco</reg>.</p>
<p>During this solemn debate Captain Smith must have <lb/>
felt anything but comfortable. He did not know his <lb/>
doom until two stones were brought in and placed before <lb/>
Powhatan. Then as many as could lay hands on him <lb/>
dragged him to the feet of the chief and laid his head <reg orig="up-|on">upon</reg> <lb/>
the stones. The executioners raised their clubs to <lb/>
beat out his brains. Such a scene was not uncommon in <lb/>
this forest court. From childhood these savage men and <lb/>
women were accustomed to exult in the most barbarous <lb/>
tortures and executions. It is then the more wonderful <lb/>
that the heart of a little Indian maiden should have been <lb/>
touched with pity for the doomed white man. <reg orig="Poca-|hontas">Pocahontas</reg>, <lb/>
a child of ten or twelve, and "the king's dearest <lb/>
daughter," pleaded for the life of the captive. But "no <lb/>
entreaty could prevail" with the stern Powhatan.</p>
<p>The warriors were ready to strike the blow, when the <lb/>
child flew to the side of Captain Smith, took "his head <lb/>
in her arms and laid her own upon his to save him from <lb/>
death, whereat," says the quaint narrative "the Emperor <lb/>
&lsqb;Powhatan&rsqb; was contented he should live to make him <lb/>
<pb n="150" entity="b002082275_0175"/>
hatchets and her beads and copper," thinking he was <lb/>
accustomed to follow all occupations. "For," says the <lb/>
story, "the king himself will make his own robes, shoes, <lb/>
bows, arrows, and pots," while he would "plant, hunt, or <lb/>
do any thing so well as the rest."</p>
<p>Powhatan did not long detain Captain Smith for such <lb/>
trivial uses as making trinkets for Pocahontas. It had <lb/>
become the desire of his heart to possess the powerful <lb/>
weapons and tools of the English. He saw that a friend <lb/>
in Jamestown would be a good thing, and he perhaps <lb/>
hoped from friendly commerce with the colony to <reg orig="ac-|quire">acquire</reg> <lb/>
ascendancy over other Indian tribes.</p>
<p>He took occasion to express his wishes to Captain <lb/>
Smith in a curious manner.</p>
<p>Two days after his rescue from death he had the <lb/>
captive taken to one of his arbour-like buildings in the <lb/>
woods and left alone upon a mat by the fire. The house <lb/>
was curtained off in the centre with a mat. Soon a <lb/>
most doleful noise came from behind the mat, and <reg orig="Pow-|hatan">Powhatan</reg>, <lb/>
disguised in "the most fearfullest manner," and <lb/>
looking "more like a devil than a man," entered, with <lb/>
some two hundred Indians, painted black. The <reg orig="out-|come">outcome</reg> <lb/>
of this impressive ceremony was that Powhatan <lb/>
told Captain Smith that they were now friends, and <lb/>
that he would presently send him home, and that <lb/>
when he arrived at Jamestown he must send him two <lb/>
great guns and a grindstone. In return he said he would <lb/>
give him the country of Capahowosick, and would <lb/>
always consider him his son.</p>
<p>Captain Smith was accordingly sent to Jamestown <lb/>
with twelve guides. The Indians delayed on their <lb/>
journey, though the distance was short. They camped <lb/>
in the woods one night, and feasted sumptuously; but <lb/>
<pb n="151" entity="b002082275_0176"/>
Captain Smith was in constant fear of his life still, <lb/>
"expecting everyhour to be put to one death or another." <lb/>
He was, however, led in safety to the fort. Here he <lb/>
treated his savage guides with great hospitality, and <lb/>
showed Rawhunt, a trusty servant of Powhatan, two <lb/>
demi-culverins &lpar;long cannons carrying a nine-pound shot&rpar; <lb/>
and a mill-stone to carry to his chief. The Indians <lb/>
however, "found them somewhat too heavy." For <lb/>
their benefit, Captain Smith had the guns loaded with <lb/>
stones, and discharged among the boughs of trees covered <lb/>
with icicles. The crashing fall of the ice-laden limbs <lb/>
so frightened the Indians that they fled, "half dead with <lb/>
fear," and it was some time before they could be induced <lb/>
to return. Presents of various toys were given them <lb/>
for Powhatan and his family, and they went away satisfied.</p>
<p>The winter of 1607&ndash;08 was remarkably cold, both in <lb/>
Europe and America. In the midst of its severity an <lb/>
accident resulted in a fire which destroyed many of the <lb/>
reed-thatched cottages, the palisades, and much of the <lb/>
provisions of the colonists at Jamestown.</p>
<p>Powhatan still looked with covetous eyes upon the <lb/>
glittering swords, the ponderous muskets, and the <reg orig="service-|able">serviceable</reg> <lb/>
pistols of the English. So long as the white man <lb/>
used supernatural bullets and sharp-edged swords <lb/>
and the red man possessed only tomahawks of stone and <lb/>
stone-pointed arrows and javelins, so long were the <lb/>
English safe from Indian attacks. It was now the <lb/>
ambition of Powhatan's life to obtain a goodly store of <lb/>
English weapons, instead of the rude wooden swords used <lb/>
by the Indians. Savage-like, he went about his purpose <lb/>
in the most crafty way with the most innocent air. And <lb/>
sent twenty turkeys "to express his love," with the request <lb/>
that Captain Smith would return the compliment with a <lb/>
<pb n="152" entity="b002082275_0177"/>
present of twenty swords. But Smith refused, knowing <lb/>
it would cut the throat of the colony to put such weapons <lb/>
into the hands of the crafty chief.</p>
<p>Powhatan was not to be thus outdone. If he could <lb/>
not procure the swords in one way he would in another. <lb/>
"He caused his people with twenty devices to obtain" <lb/>
as many swords. The Indians became "insolent." <lb/>
They surprised the colonists at their work. They would <lb/>
lie in ambuscade at the very gates of Jamestown and <lb/>
procure the weapons of stragglers by force. The council <lb/>
in England had deemed it the only wise policy to keep <lb/>
peace with the savages at all hazards, and a wise policy <lb/>
it was if it were not carried too far. The orders from <lb/>
this body had been very strict; the colonists were in no <lb/>
way to offend the Indians.</p>
<p>Thus a "charitable humour prevailed" until Captain <lb/>
Smith was the man they "meddled" with. This fiery <lb/>
soldier did not wait for deliberation. He hunted the <lb/>
miscreants, and those whom he captured he "terrified" <lb/>
with whipping and imprisonment. In return, the Indians <lb/>
captured two straggling Englishmen, and came in force <lb/>
to the very gates of Jamestown, demanding seven Indians, <lb/>
whom, "for their villainies," Smith had detained. The <lb/>
irrepressible Captain immediately headed a sally in which <lb/>
he forced the Indians to surrender the Englishmen <lb/>
unconditionally. He then examined his prisoners, <lb/>
but they were faithful to their chief, and he could get <lb/>
nothing from them. He made six of them believe, by <lb/>
"several volleys of shot," that he had caused one of their <lb/>
number to be killed. They immediately confessed, in <lb/>
separate examinations, to a plot on the part of <lb/>
Powhatan to procure the weapons, and then to cut <lb/>
the throats of the colonists. Captain Smith still <lb/>
<pb n="153" entity="b002082275_0178"/>
detained the Indians, resolving to give them a <reg orig="whole-|some">wholesome</reg> <lb/>
fright.</p>
<p>Pocahontas presently came to Jamestown, <reg orig="accom-|panied">accompanied</reg> <lb/>
by Indian messengers. Her father had sent <lb/>
them with presents, and a message excusing "the injuries <lb/>
done by some rash, untoward captains, his subjects, <lb/>
desiring their liberties for this time with the assurance <lb/>
of his love forever."</p>
<p>When Captain Smith had punished his seven prisoners <lb/>
as he thought fit, he "used them well" for a few days, <lb/>
and delivered them to Pocahontas, pretending that he <lb/>
saved their lives only for the sake of the little Indian <lb/>
girl.</p>
<p>One cannot refrain from admiring in the brave <reg orig="colon-|ists">colonists</reg> <lb/>
and their captain the fortitude and persistence that <lb/>
they showed, and the wonderful tact with which they <lb/>
managed the natives. Many had died, some had <reg orig="re-|covered">recovered</reg>, <lb/>
and others were still sick.</p>
<p>Captain Smith had been installed as president. He <lb/>
governed the colony wisely. His measures were <reg orig="doubt-|less">doubtless</reg> <lb/>
severe, but severity was necessary among these men <lb/>
totally unqualified for a frontier life, with an unwise <lb/>
management in England, and endless discontent and <lb/>
jealousy at Jamestown. Men shut up together in hard <lb/>
circumstances are sure to fall out.</p>
<p>Captain Smith went energetically to work to better <lb/>
the condition of the colony. Jamestown was once more <lb/>
the scene of busy activity. Church and storehouse were <lb/>
repaired, new houses built for more supplies, and the <lb/>
fort altered in form. The soldiers were drilled every <lb/>
day upon a plain called Smithfield. Here crowds of <lb/>
Indians would gather to watch with wonder the <reg orig="English-|men">Englishmen</reg> <lb/>
shoot at a mark.</p>
<pb n="154" entity="b002082275_0179"/>
<p>Captain Smith, to quiet all fears, and to show his <lb/>
willingness to assist in the business on hand, as well as <lb/>
to hasten an affair which would consume so much <reg orig="valu-|able">valuable</reg> <lb/>
time, undertook with four companions a journey <lb/>
to Werowocomoco, to ask Powhatan to come to <reg orig="James-|town">Jamestown</reg>.</p>
<p>It was now the season to trade for corn with the <lb/>
Indians.</p>
<p>When the Englishmen reached the home of Powhatan <lb/>
they found that he was some thirty miles away. They <lb/>
were received by the steadfast friend of all white men, <lb/>
Pocahontas. She sent messengers for her father, and <lb/>
undertook to entertain her friends while they waited.</p>
<p>The Englishmen were left in an open space, seated <lb/>
on a mat by the fire. Suddenly they heard a "hideous <lb/>
noise" in the woods. Supposing that Powhatan and <lb/>
his warriors were upon them, they sprang to their feet, <lb/>
grasped their arms and seized two or three old Indians <lb/>
who were near them. Pocahontas came to them, however, <lb/>
with her apology, saying that they might kill her "if <lb/>
any hurt were intended." Those who stood near, men, <lb/>
women and children, assured the white men that all <lb/>
was right. Presently thirty young women came <reg orig="rush-|ing">rushing</reg> <lb/>
out of the woods. Their only covering was a <reg orig="cinc-|ture">cincture</reg> <lb/>
or apron of green leaves; they were gaily painted, <lb/>
some one colour and some another. Every girl wore a <lb/>
pair of deer's horns on her head, while from her girdle and <lb/>
upon one arm hung an otter's skin. The leader wore a <lb/>
quiver of arrows, and carried a bow and arrow in her <lb/>
hands. The others followed with swords, clubs and <lb/>
pot-sticks.</p>
<p>"These fiends, with most hellish shouts and cries. <lb/>
<pb n="155" entity="b002082275_0180"/>
says the ungallant narrator, "cast themselves in a ring <lb/>
about the fire, singing and dancing with most excellent <lb/>
ill variety." This masquerade lasted about half an hour, <lb/>
when the Indian girls disappeared as they had come.</p>
<p>They again reappeared in their ordinary costume. <lb/>
Pocahontas invited Captain Smith to a dinner which <lb/>
had been spread for him with "all the savage dainties" <lb/>
which they could procure. They tormented the <reg orig="cap-|tain">captain</reg> <lb/>
by pressing around him saying, "Love you not <lb/>
me? Love you not me?" While he feasted they danced, <lb/>
and ended by conducting him to his lodging with <reg orig="fire-|brands">firebrands</reg> <lb/>
for torches.</p>
<p>Powhatan arrived the next day. Cold weather had <lb/>
come and famine began to stare the colonists in <lb/>
the face. The president set out for the country of <lb/>
the Nansemond Indians. These people refused not <lb/>
only to provide the four hundred bushels of corn <lb/>
which they had promised in their treaty with the <lb/>
colonists on their previous visit, but they refused to trade <lb/>
at all. Their excuse was that they had used up the most <lb/>
that they had, and that they were under commands from <lb/>
Powhatan neither to trade with the English nor to allow <lb/>
them to enter their river. The English had recourse to <lb/>
force, and the Indians fled at the first volley of musketry <lb/>
without shooting a single arrow. The first cabin the <lb/>
white men discovered they set on fire. The Indians <reg orig="im-|mediately">immediately</reg> <lb/>
desired peace, and promised the English half <lb/>
that they had. Before night all the boats were loaded <lb/>
with corn, and the English sailed some four miles down <lb/>
the river. Here they camped out for the night in the <lb/>
open woods on frozen ground covered with snow.</p>
<p>The manner in which these adventurers of nearly <lb/>
<pb n="156" entity="b002082275_0181"/>
three hundred years ago made themselves comfortable <lb/>
is interesting. They would dig away the snow and build <lb/>
a great fire, which would serve to dry and warm the <lb/>
ground. They would then scrape away the fire, spread <lb/>
a mat on the place where it had been, and here they <lb/>
would sleep with another mat hung up as a shield against <lb/>
the wind. In the night, as the wind shifted, they would <lb/>
change their hanging mat, and when the ground grew <lb/>
cold they would again remove their fire and take its place. <lb/>
Their story says that many "a cold winter night" did <lb/>
the adventurers sleep thus; and yet those who went on <lb/>
these expeditions "were always in health, lusty and fat."</p>
<p>Finding that the old Indian chief had determined to <lb/>
starve the colony out of existence by a refusal to trade <lb/>
with the white men, Captain Smith, appreciating the <lb/>
desperate extremity, resolved to take, as usual, the boldest <lb/>
plan out of the difficulty. He meditated a plan for <reg orig="surpris-|ing">surprising</reg> <lb/>
and entrapping Powhatan into his power. Smith <lb/>
saw no other chance to procure food, and starving men <lb/>
do not stop to debate whether a course is right or wrong.</p>
<p>About this time Powhatan sent a message to Smith <lb/>
inviting him to visit him, and saying that if he would <lb/>
but build him a house, give him a grindstone, fifty swords, <lb/>
some firearms, a hen and rooster, and much beads and <reg orig="cop-|per">copper</reg>, <lb/>
he would fill the ship with corn. Captain Smith <lb/>
made haste to accept this offer. He sent some of the <lb/>
Dutchmen and some Englishmen ahead to begin the <lb/>
building of Powhatan's house.</p>
<p>On the twelfth of January the English neared <reg orig="Wero-|wocomoco">Werowocomoco</reg>. <lb/>
The ice extended nearly half a mile from <lb/>
shore in the York River. Captain Smith pushed as near <lb/>
the shore as he could in the barge, by breaking the ice. <lb/>
Impatient of remaining in an open boat in the freezing cold <lb/>
<pb n="157" entity="b002082275_0182"/>
he jumped into the half-frozen marsh, and waded ashore. <lb/>
His example was followed by eighteen of his men.</p>
<p>The English quartered at the first cabins they reached, <lb/>
and announced their arrival in a message to Powhatan, <lb/>
requesting provision. The chief sent them plenty of <lb/>
bread, venison and turkeys, and feasted them according <lb/>
to his custom. The following day, however, he desired <lb/>
to know when they "would be gone," pretending that he <lb/>
had not sent for the English. He made the astonishing <lb/>
statement that he himself had no corn, and his people had <lb/>
much less; but that he would furnish them forty baskets <lb/>
of this grain for as many swords. Captain Smith quickly <lb/>
confronted him with the men who had brought <reg orig="Pow-|hatan's">Powhatan's</reg> <lb/>
message to Jamestown, and asked the chief "how <lb/>
it chanced he became so forgetful." Powhatan answered <lb/>
with "a merry laughter," and invited the English to show <lb/>
their commodities. But the crafty chief was not suited <lb/>
with anything, unless it were guns or swords.</p>
<p>"Powhatan," said Captain Smith, "believing your <lb/>
promises to supply my wants, I neglected all to satisfy <lb/>
your desire, and to testify my love I sent you my men <lb/>
for your building, neglecting mine own. As for swords <lb/>
and guns, I told you long ago I had none to spare, and <lb/>
you must know those I have can keep me from want. <lb/>
Yet steal or wrong you I will not, nor dissolve that <reg orig="friend-|ship">friendship</reg> <lb/>
we have mutually promised, except you constrain <lb/>
me by your bad usage."</p>
<p>Powhatan listened attentively to this speech, and <lb/>
promised that he would spare them what he could, which <lb/>
he would deliver to them in two days.</p>
<p>"Yet, Captain Smith," said the chief, "I have some <lb/>
doubt of your coming hither that makes me not so kindly <lb/>
seek to relieve you as I would, for many do inform me <lb/>
<pb n="158" entity="b002082275_0183"/>
your coming hither is not for trade, but to invade my <lb/>
people and possess my country, who dare not bring you <lb/>
corn, seeing you thus armed with your men. To free us <lb/>
of this fear, leave aboard your weapons, for here they are <lb/>
needless, we being all friends."</p>
<p>But Captain Smith was not to be cajoled into a council <lb/>
without weapons. That night was spent at <reg orig="Werowo-|comoco">Werowocomoco</reg>, <lb/>
and the following day the building of Powhatan's <lb/>
house went forward.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the English managed "to wrangle" some <lb/>
ten bushels of corn out of the chief for a copper kettle.</p>
<p>The chief was dissatisfied that he could not have his <lb/>
way.</p>
<p>"Captain Smith," said Powhatan with a sigh, "I never <lb/>
used any werowance so kindly as yourself, yet from you <lb/>
I receive the least kindness of any. Another captain <lb/>
gave me swords, copper, clothes, a bed, towels or what <lb/>
I desired, ever taking what I offered him, and would send <lb/>
away his guns when I entreated him; none doth deny to <lb/>
lie at my feet or refuse to do what I desire but only you, <lb/>
of whom I can have nothing but what you regard not, and <lb/>
yet you will have whatsoever you demand. You call <lb/>
me father, but I see you will do what you list, and we <lb/>
must seek to content you. But if you intend so friendly <lb/>
as you say, send hence your arms, that I may believe <lb/>
you."</p>
<p>The wily old chief was right. Captain Smith was <lb/>
determined to have his own way. He saw that nothing <lb/>
could be gained thus. Powhatan was watching with <lb/>
lynx eyes for a chance to get the white men into his power <lb/>
while he delivered eloquent and persuasive speeches. <lb/>
Captain Smith asked the savages to break the ice for <lb/>
<pb n="159" entity="b002082275_0184"/>
him that his boat might reach the shore, to take him <lb/>
and the corn. He intended, when the boat came, to land <lb/>
more men and surprise the chief. Meanwhile, to <reg orig="en-|tertain">entertain</reg> <lb/>
Powhatan and keep him from suspecting anything, <lb/>
he made the following reply to his last speech:</p>
<p>"Powhatan, you must know as I have but one God <lb/>
I honour but one king, and I live not here as your <reg orig="sub-|ject">subject</reg>, <lb/>
but as your friend, to pleasure you with what I can. <lb/>
By the gifts you bestow on me you gain more than by <lb/>
trade, yet would you visit me as I do you, you should <lb/>
know it is not our custom to sell our courtesies. To <lb/>
content you, to-morrow I will leave my arms and trust <lb/>
to your promise. I call you father indeed, and as a father <lb/>
you shall see I will love you; but the small care you have <lb/>
for such a child caused my men to persuade me to look <lb/>
to myself."</p>
<p>But Powhatan was not to be fooled. His mind was on <lb/>
the fast disappearing ice. He managed to disengage <lb/>
himself from the captain's conversation, and secretly <lb/>
fled with his women, children and luggage. To avoid <lb/>
any suspicion, two or three women were left to engage <lb/>
Captain Smith in talk while warriors beset the house <lb/>
where they were. When Captain Smith discovered what <lb/>
they were doing, he and John Russell went about making <lb/>
their way out with the help of their pistols, swords and <lb/>
Indian shields. At the first shot the savages tumbled <lb/>
"one over another" and quickly fled in every direction, <lb/>
and the two men reached their companions in safety.</p>
<p>Powhatan saw that his stratagem had failed. He <lb/>
immediately tried to remove the unfavourable <reg orig="impres-|sion">impression</reg> <lb/>
which this event and the sudden appearance of so <lb/>
many warriors might make on the minds of the English, <lb/>
<pb n="160" entity="b002082275_0185"/>
He sent an "ancient orator" to Captain Smith with <lb/>
presents of a great bracelet and chain of pearls.</p>
<p>"Captain Smith," said the Indian, "our werowance <lb/>
has fled, fearing your guns, and knowing when the ice <lb/>
was broken there would come more men; he sent these <lb/>
numbers but to guard his corn from stealing. Now since <lb/>
the ice is open, he would have you send away your corn, <lb/>
and if you would have his company, send away also <lb/>
your guns, which so affrighteth his people that they dare <lb/>
not come to you as he promised they should."</p>
<p>The Indians provided baskets that the English might <lb/>
carry their corn to the boat. They were officious in <reg orig="tend-|ering">tendering</reg> <lb/>
their services to guard the colonists' arms while <lb/>
they were thus occupied, lest any one should steal them. <lb/>
There were crowds of those grim, sturdy savages about; <lb/>
but the sight of the white men cocking their matchlock <lb/>
guns rendered them exceedingly meek. They were <lb/>
easily persuaded by this sight to leave their bows and <lb/>
arrows in charge of the Englishmen, while they themselves <lb/>
carried the corn down to the boats on their own backs. <lb/>
This they did with wonderful dispatch.</p>
<p>Ebb tide left the boat stuck in the marsh, and the <lb/>
adventurers were obliged to remain at Werowocomoco <lb/>
until high water. They returned to the cabins where <lb/>
they were at first quartered. The savages entertained <lb/>
them until night with "merry sports," and then left <lb/>
them. Powhatan was gathering his forces and planning <lb/>
the certain destruction of his visitors. The English were <lb/>
alone in the Indian cabins. Suddenly Pocahontas, <reg orig="Pow-|hatan's">Powhatan's</reg> <lb/>
"dearest jewel and daughter," as she is styled <lb/>
in the quaint narrative, appeared before Captain Smith. <lb/>
She had come this dark night through the "irksome <lb/>
woods" alone from her father's cabin.</p>
<pb n="161" entity="b002082275_0186"/>
<p>"Captain Smith," said she, "great cheer will be sent you <lb/>
by and by; but Powhatan and all the power he can make <lb/>
will after come and kill you all, if they that bring you <lb/>
the cheer do not kill you with your own weapons when <lb/>
you are at supper. Therefore, if you would live, I wish <lb/>
you presently to be gone."</p>
<p>Captain Smith wished to give Pocahontas presents <lb/>
of those trifles dear to the heart of an Indian, and such <lb/>
as Pocahontas most delighted in.</p>
<p>"I dare not," said the girl, with tears running down <lb/>
her cheeks, "be seen to have any, for if Powhatan should <lb/>
know it, I am but dead."</p>
<p>She then ran away into the woods as she had come. <lb/>
Within less than an hour, eight or ten savages came, <lb/>
bringing great platters of vension and other food. They <lb/>
begged the Englishmen to put out the matches of their <lb/>
guns, for the "smoke made them sick," and to sit down to <lb/>
eat. But the Captain was vigilant. He made the Indians <lb/>
first taste of every dish, and he then sent them back to <lb/>
Powhatan, asking him, "to make haste," for he was <lb/>
awaiting his arrival. Soon after more messengers came, <lb/>
"to see what news," and they were followed in a short <lb/>
time by still more. Thus the night was spent by both <lb/>
parties with the utmost vigilance, though to all <reg orig="appear-|ances">appearances</reg> <lb/>
they were on very friendly terms. When high water <lb/>
came the English prepared to depart. At Powhatan's <reg orig="re-|quest">request</reg> <lb/>
they left a man named Edward Brynton to hunt <lb/>
for him, while the Dutchmen remained to finish his house.</p>
<p>On an eminence near where Werowocomoco must <lb/>
have been, still stands a stone chimney which is known <lb/>
to this day as "Powhatan's Chimney," and according to <lb/>
tradition is the chimney of the house which the colonists <lb/>
erected for this chief.</p>
<pb n="162" entity="b002082275_0187"/>
<p>For several years Powhatan continued to be hostile <lb/>
to the colonists. In one way and another he possessed <lb/>
himself of many English arms, and detained a number <lb/>
of Englishmen as prisoners. Some time after this <reg orig="Poca-|hontas">Pocahontas</reg> <lb/>
happened to be among the Potomacs on the river <lb/>
of that name. One account says that she had gone <lb/>
thither, feasting among her friends, but another writer <lb/>
of that time says that she had been sent to the Potomacs <lb/>
to trade with them. Perhaps also Powhatan distrusted <lb/>
her friendship for the whites. Whatever may have been <lb/>
the cause, Pocahontas was certainly making a stay on the <lb/>
Potomac River.</p>
<p>The English Captain Argall had gone to trade with <lb/>
the Indians on the Potomac. Some friendly Indians <reg orig="in-|formed">informed</reg> <lb/>
him that Pocahontas was in the region. A plan <lb/>
for bringing Powhatan to terms immediately suggested <lb/>
itself to the unscrupulous captain. He sent for one of <lb/>
the Indian chiefs, and told him that if he did not give <lb/>
Pocahontas into his hands they would no longer be "<reg orig="broth-|ers">brothers</reg> <lb/>
nor friends." The Potomac Indians were at first <lb/>
unwilling to do this, fearing that it might involve them <lb/>
in a war with Powhatan. Captain Argall assured them <lb/>
that he would take their part in such a war, and they <lb/>
consented to his plan.</p>
<p>The following story is told of the manner in which <lb/>
Pocahontas was betrayed. The Indian girl manifested <lb/>
no desire to go aboard Captain Argall's vessels, having <lb/>
many a time been on English vessels, in her friendly <lb/>
relations with the whites. Captain Argall offered an <lb/>
old Indian named Japazaws the irresistible bribe of a <lb/>
copper kettle if he would betray Pocahontas into his <lb/>
power. Japazaws undertook to do this with the <reg orig="assis-|ance">assisance</reg> <lb/>
of his wife. This wife became immediately possessed <lb/>
<pb n="163" entity="b002082275_0188"/>
with an intense desire to visit the English ship, which she <lb/>
said had been there three or four times and she had never <lb/>
been aboard it. She begged her husband to allow her <lb/>
to go aboard, but Japazaws sternly refused, saying she <lb/>
could not go unless she had some woman to accompany <lb/>
her. He at last threatened to beat her for her persistence.</p>
<p>The tender heart of Pocahontas was moved with pity; <lb/>
she offered to accompany the woman on board the <reg orig="Eng-|lish">English</reg> <lb/>
vessel. Japazaws and his wife with the chief's <lb/>
daughter were taken on to the ship, where they were well <lb/>
entertained and invited to supper. The old man and <lb/>
his wife were so well pleased with their success that <reg orig="dur-|ing">during</reg> <lb/>
the whole meal they kept treading on Captain Argall's <lb/>
toes. After supper the captain sent Pocahontas to the <lb/>
gun-room while he pretended to have a private <reg orig="conversa-|tion">conversation</reg> <lb/>
with Japazaws. He presently recalled her, and told <lb/>
her that she must remain with him, and that she should <lb/>
not again see Powhatan until she had served to bring <lb/>
about a peace between her father and the English. <reg orig="Im-|mediately">Immediately</reg> <lb/>
Japazaws and his wife set up "a howl and <lb/>
cry," and Pocahontas began to be "exceedingly pensive <lb/>
and discontented." The old people were rowed to shore, <lb/>
happy in the possession of their copper kettle and some <lb/>
trinkets.</p>
<p>Captain Argall sent an Indian messenger to Powhatan, <lb/>
informing him that "his delight and darling, his <reg orig="daugh-|ter">daughter</reg> <lb/>
Pocahontas," was a prisoner, and informing him that <lb/>
"if he would send home the Englishmen whom he had <lb/>
detained in slavery, with such arms and tools as the Indians <lb/>
had gotten and stolen, and also a great quantity of corn, <lb/>
that then he should have his daughter restored, <reg orig="other-|wise">otherwise</reg> <lb/>
not."</p>
<p>Powhatan was "very much grieved," having a strong <lb/>
<pb n="164" entity="b002082275_0189"/>
affection both for his daughter and for the English <lb/>
weapons which he possessed. It was a hard alternative. <lb/>
He sent, however, a message desiring the English to use <lb/>
Pocahontas well, and promising to perform the <reg orig="condi-|tions">conditions</reg> <lb/>
for her rescue.</p>
<p>It was a long time before anything more was heard <lb/>
from Powhatan. After three months he sent to the <lb/>
governor by way of ransom seven Englishmen, overjoyed <lb/>
to be free from slavery and the constant fear of cruel <lb/>
death, three muskets, a broadaxe, a whip-saw, and a <lb/>
canoe full of corn. These were accompanied by a <reg orig="mes-|sage">message</reg> <lb/>
to the effect that he would satisfy injuries, give the <lb/>
English a large quantity of corn, and be forever their <lb/>
friend when his daughter was delivered up. The English <lb/>
received these things "in part payment," and returned <lb/>
such an answer as this to Powhatan:</p>
<p>"Your daughter shall be well used, but we cannot believe <lb/>
the rest of our arms are either lost or stolen from you, and <lb/>
therefore, till you send them we will keep your daughter."</p>
<p>The wily old chief was much grieved at this message, <lb/>
and it was again a long time before anything was heard <lb/>
from him. At last Sir Thomas Dale, then the governor of <lb/>
the colony, taking with him Pocahontas and one hundred <lb/>
and fifty men, embarked in the colony's vessels for a visit <lb/>
to Powhatan. The party sailed up the York River. <lb/>
Powhatan was not to be seen. The English told the <lb/>
Indians that they had come to deliver up the daughter <lb/>
of Powhatan and to receive the promised return of men <lb/>
and arms. These overtures were received with <reg orig="scorn-|ful">scornful</reg> <lb/>
threats and open hostility. Skirmishing ensued, in <lb/>
which some of the Indian houses were burned and <reg orig="prop-|erty">property</reg> <lb/>
spoiled.</p>
<pb n="165" entity="b002082275_0190"/>
<p>The Indians asked why this had been done. The <lb/>
English answered by asking why they had shot at them. <lb/>
The Indians excused themselves, laying the blame on <lb/>
some straggling savages. They protested they intended <lb/>
no harm, but were the white man's friends. The <reg orig="Eng-|lish">English</reg> <lb/>
rejoined that they did not come to hurt them, but <lb/>
came as friends.</p>
<p>A peace was patched up and messengers were sent to <lb/>
Powhatan. The Indians told the English that their <lb/>
imprisoned men "were run off" for fear the English would <lb/>
hang them, but that Powhatan's men "were run after <lb/>
to bring them back." They promised to return them <lb/>
with the stolen swords and muskets on the following <lb/>
day. The English perceived that this story was told <lb/>
only to gain time.</p>
<p>Meantime two brothers of Pocahontas came aboard <lb/>
the ship to visit her. They had heard that she was not <lb/>
well, and were overjoyed to find her in good health and <lb/>
contented. While they were visiting with their sister, <lb/>
Mr. John Rolfe and Mr. Sparks were sent to negotiate <lb/>
with Powhatan. They were received kindly and <reg orig="hos-|pitably">hospitably</reg> <lb/>
entertained, but they were not admitted to the <lb/>
presence of the offended chief. His brother, <reg orig="Opechan-|canough">Opechancanough</reg>, <lb/>
saw them and promised to do the best he could <lb/>
with Powhatan, saying that "all might be well." With <lb/>
such slight satisfaction the English were obliged to return <lb/>
to Jamestown, for it was now April and time to sow corn.</p>
<p>Pocahontas had been about a year a prisoner at <reg orig="James-|town">Jamestown</reg>. <lb/>
There can be no doubt that she was treated <lb/>
with the greatest friendliness by the colonists. Her <reg orig="feel-|ings">feelings</reg> <lb/>
had always been warm for the white strangers. <lb/>
Now that she was an innocent and interesting young <lb/>
prisoner among them, what more natural than that she <lb/>
<pb n="166" entity="b002082275_0191"/>
should be honoured and petted? Pocahontas was now <lb/>
a woman, being about eighteen to nineteen years of age. <lb/>
To judge from her portrait she could not have had the <lb/>
beauty with which tradition has invested her, but she <lb/>
had at least a pleasant and interesting face, and there <lb/>
must have been some charm in her large black eyes and <lb/>
straight black hair.</p>
<p>There was one colonist at least who took a great inter <lb/>
est in the young prisoner. Mr. John Rolfe is styled in <lb/>
the different records "an honest gentleman of good <lb/>
behaviour," "an honest and discreet English gentleman," <lb/>
"a gentleman of approved behaviour and honest <reg orig="car-|riage">carriage</reg>."</p>
<p>The subject of the conversion of Pocahontas had <lb/>
weighed heavily upon the mind of Mr. Rolfe. He <reg orig="ac-|cordingly">accordingly</reg> <lb/>
attempted to convert her to Christianity, and <lb/>
in doing so fell in love with her. Pocahontas became a <lb/>
Christian, and what more natural than that the constant <lb/>
friend of the white men should love an Englishman?</p>
<p>Long before the trip up the York River Mr. Rolfe <lb/>
had loved the Indian maiden. He wrote a long letter <lb/>
to the governor, Sir Thomas Dale, asking his advice. <lb/>
Sir Thomas readily consented to the marriage. <reg orig="Poca-|hontas">Pocahontas</reg>, <lb/>
on her part, told her brother of her attachment <lb/>
to Mr. Rolfe. He informed Powhatan, who seemed to <lb/>
have been well pleased with the proposition, for within <lb/>
ten days an old uncle of Pocahontas and two of her <lb/>
brothers arrived at Jamestown. Powhatan had sent <lb/>
them as deputies to witness the marriage of his daughter, <lb/>
and to do his part toward the confirmation of it.</p>
<p>Pocahontas was first baptised. It was deemed <reg orig="nec-|essary">necessary</reg> <lb/>
to give her a Christian name at her baptism. She <lb/>
was christened Rebecca, and as a king's daughter she <lb/>
<pb n="167" entity="b002082275_0192"/>
was known after this as the Lady Rebecca, and <reg orig="some-|times">sometimes</reg> <lb/>
at the Lady Pocahontas.</p>
<p>In April, 1614, the odd bridal procession moved up <lb/>
the little church with its wide-open windows and its cedar <lb/>
pews. The bridegroom was a young Englishman, the <lb/>
bride an Indian chief's daughter, accompanied by two <lb/>
red-skinned warriors, her brothers. Before the altar <lb/>
with its canoe-like front Pocahontas repeated in <reg orig="imper-|fect">imperfect</reg> <lb/>
English her marriage vows, and received her wedding <lb/>
ring. The wedding is briefly mentioned by the old <lb/>
recorders only as something bearing upon the welfare of <lb/>
the colony. It was the first union between the people <lb/>
who were to possess the land and the natives. The <lb/>
colonists doubtless regarded it as a most auspicious <lb/>
event, binding as it did the most powerful chief in <reg orig="Vir-|ginia">Virginia</reg> <lb/>
to their interests.</p>
<p>From this day friendly intercourse and trade were <lb/>
again established with Powhatan and his people. To <lb/>
the day of his death the old chief never violated the <lb/>
peace which was thus brought about.</p>
<p>In still another way the marriage of Pocahontas <reg orig="bene-|fited">benefited</reg> <lb/>
the colony. The nearest neighbours of the <reg orig="Eng-|lish">English</reg> <lb/>
were the Chickahominys, a powerful tribe of Indians <lb/>
who were just now free from the yoke of Powhatan, <lb/>
whom they regarded as a tyrant. They had taken <lb/>
advantage of the recent differences between this chief <lb/>
and the colonists to hold themselves exceedingly <reg orig="inde-|pendent">independent</reg> <lb/>
of both. But now that Powhatan and the <lb/>
English were united, the Chickahominys began to fear <lb/>
for their own liberty. They sent a deputation to Sir <lb/>
Thomas Dale desiring peace. Dale visited them, <reg orig="en-|tered">entered</reg> <lb/>
their council, and concluded a treaty stipulating <lb/>
that the Chickahominy Indians should call themselves <lb/>
<pb n="168" entity="b002082275_0193"/>
Tassantessus, or Englishmen, as a sign of friendship, <lb/>
and fulfil other conditions.</p>
<p>Sir Thomas Dale had been five years in Virginia <lb/>
when in 1616 he settled the affairs of the colony, and <lb/>
embarked for England. He took with him Mr. Rolfe, <lb/>
Pocahontas, Tomocomo, one of Powhatan's chief men, <lb/>
married to his daughter, Matachanna, and other Indians. <lb/>
Tomocomo, who was considered among the Indians <lb/>
"an understanding fellow," had been charged by <reg orig="Powha-|tan">Powhatan</reg> <lb/>
to count the people in England and give him an <lb/>
exact idea of their strength.</p>
<p>The vessel reached Plymouth on the 12th of June, <lb/>
1616. On leaving the vessel Tomocomo was prepared <lb/>
with a long stick and a knife ready to make a notch for <lb/>
every man he saw. He kept this up till "his arithmetic <lb/>
failed him." We can imagine the excitement that <reg orig="fol-|lowed">followed</reg> <lb/>
these travellers everywhere. They were all <lb/>
wonders, but especially was the "Princess" Pocahontas.</p>
<p>Pocahontas was now mother to a little son, Thomas <lb/>
Rolfe, whom she "loved most dearly." Immediately <lb/>
on her arrival the Virginia Company took measures for <lb/>
the maintenance of her and her child. Persons of great <lb/>
"rank and quality" took much notice of Pocahontas. <lb/>
She did not like the smoke of London, and was removed <lb/>
to Brentford.</p>
<p>Captain Smith was at this time between two voyages <lb/>
and his stay in London was limited. He met <reg orig="Tomo-|como">Tomocomo</reg>, <lb/>
and they renewed old acquaintance.</p>
<p>"Captain Smith," said the Indian, "Powhatan did <lb/>
bid me find you out, to show me your God, and the king <lb/>
and queen and prince you so much had told us of."</p>
<p>"Concerning God," says Smith, in writing of this <lb/>
<pb n="169" entity="b002082275_0194"/>
meeting,"I told him the best I could, the king I heard <lb/>
he had seen, and the rest he should see when he would." <lb/>
Tomocomo, however, denied having seen King James <lb/>
till Smith satisfied him that he had by the circumstances. <lb/>
Tomocomo immediately looked very melancholy and said:</p>
<p>"You gave Powhatan a white dog, which Powhatan <lb/>
fed as himself, but your king gave me nothing, and I <lb/>
am better than your white dog."</p>
<p>Captain Smith, desiring to return the courtesy of <lb/>
Pocahontas, wrote the following letter to Queen Anne <lb/>
immediately upon hearing of the arrival of Pocahontas: <lb/>
<q><hi rend="italic">To the most high and virtuous Princess, Queen Anne of Great <lb/>
Britain</hi></q>
<q><hi rend="small-caps">Most admired Queen</hi>: The love I bear my God, my king, and <lb/>
country hath so oft emboldened me in the worst of extreme <reg orig="dan-|gers">dangers</reg>, <lb/>
that now honesty doth constrain me to presume thus far <lb/>
beyond myself to present Your Majesty this short discourse. If <lb/>
ingratitude be a deadly poison to all honest virtues, I must be <lb/>
guilty of that crime if I should omit any means to be thankful.</q>
<q>So it is that some ten years ago, being in Virginia, and taken <lb/>
prisoner by the power of Powhatan, their chief king, I received <lb/>
from this great savage exceeding great courtesy, especially from <lb/>
his son Nantequas, the most manliest, comeliest, boldest spirit I <lb/>
ever saw in a savage, and his sister Pocahontas, the king's most <lb/>
dear and well-beloved daughter, being but a child of twelve or <lb/>
thirteen years of age, whose compassionate, pitiful heart, of <reg orig="des-|perate">desperate</reg> <lb/>
estate, gave me much cause to respect her. I being the <lb/>
first Christian this proud king and his grim attendants ever saw, <lb/>
and thus enthralled in their barbarous power, I cannot say that I <lb/>
felt the least occasion of want that was in the power of those mortal <lb/>
foes to prevent, notwithstanding all their threats.</q>
<q>After some six weeks fatting among these savage courtiers, at <lb/>
the minute of my execution she hazarded the beating out of her <lb/>
own brains to save mine; and not only that, but so prevailed with <lb/>
her father that I was safely conducted to Jamestown, where I <lb/>
found about eight-and-thirty miserable, poor and sick creatures <lb/>
to keep possession of all those large territories of Virginia. Such <lb/>
<pb n="170" entity="b002082275_0195"/>
was the weakness of this poor commonwealth as, had the savages <lb/>
not fed us, we directly had starved.</q>
<q>And this relief, most gracious queen, was commonly brought us <lb/>
by this lady, Pocahontas. Notwithstanding all these passages <lb/>
when inconstant fortune turned our peace to war, this tender <lb/>
virgin would still not spare to dare to visit us; and by her our jars <lb/>
have oft been appeased and our wants still supplied. Were it the <lb/>
policy of her father thus to employ her, or the ordinance of God <lb/>
thus to make her his instrument, or her extraordinary affection to <lb/>
our nation, I know not. But of this I am sure, when her father, <lb/>
with the utmost of his policy and power sought to surprise me, the <lb/>
dark night could not affright her from coming through the irksome <lb/>
woods, and with watered eyes gave me intelligence, with her best <lb/>
advice to escape his fury; which had he known he had surely slain <lb/>
her. Jamestown, with her wild train, she as freely frequented as <lb/>
her father's habitation; and, during the time of two or three years, <lb/>
she, next, under God, was still the instrument to preserve this <lb/>
colony from death, famine, and utter confusion, which if in those <lb/>
times had once been dissolved, Virginia might have lain as it was <lb/>
at our first arrival to this day.</q>
<q>Since then this business having been turned and varied by <lb/>
many accidents from that I left it at. It is most certain after a <lb/>
long and troublesome war after my departure, betwixt her father <lb/>
and our colony, all which time she was not heard of, about two <lb/>
years after she herself was taken prisoner. Being so detained near <lb/>
two years longer, the colony by that means was relieved, peace <lb/>
concluded, and at last, rejecting her barbarous condition, she was <lb/>
married to an English gentleman, with whom at present she is in <lb/>
England; the first Christian ever of that nation, the first Virginian <lb/>
ever spoke English: a matter surely, if my meaning be truly <reg orig="con-|sidered">considered</reg> <lb/>
and well understood, worthy a prince's understanding.</q>
<q>Thus, most gracious lady, I have related to Your Majesty what <lb/>
at your best leisure our approved histories will account you at <lb/>
large, and done in the time of Your Majesty's life. And, however, <lb/>
this might be presented to you from a more worthy pen, it cannot <lb/>
come from a more honest heart, as yet I never begged anything of <lb/>
the State or any; and it is my want of ability and her exceeding <lb/>
desert, your birth, means and authority, her birth, virtue, want <lb/>
and simplicity, doth make me thus bold humbly to beseech your <lb/>
majesty to take this knowledge of her, though it be from one so <lb/>
<pb n="171" entity="b002082275_0196"/>
unworthy to be the reporter as myself, her husband's estate not <lb/>
being able to make her fit to attend your majesty. The most and <lb/>
least I can do is to tell you this, because none hath so oft tried it <lb/>
as myself; and the rather being of so great a spirit, however her <lb/>
stature. If she should not be well received, seeing this kingdom <lb/>
may rightly have a kingdom by her means, her present love to us <lb/>
and Christianity might turn to such scorn and fury as to divert all <lb/>
this good to the worst of evil; where, finding so great a queen <lb/>
should do her some honour more than she can imagine, for being <lb/>
so kind to your servants and subjects, would so ravish her with <lb/>
content, as endear her dearest blood to effect that Your Majesty <lb/>
and all the king's honest subjects most earnestly desire. And so <lb/>
I humbly kiss your gracious hands.</q></p>
<p>Captain Smith went to Brentford with several others <lb/>
to see Pocahontas. She saluted him modestly, and <lb/>
without a word turned round and "obscured her face <lb/>
as not seeming well contented." Smith, with her <reg orig="hus-|band">husband</reg> <lb/>
and the other gentlemen, left her "in that humour" <lb/>
for several hours. The captain was disappointed, and <lb/>
repented having written the queen that she could speak <lb/>
English. But when the gentlemen returned Pocahontas <lb/>
began to talk, and said that she remembered Captain <lb/>
Smith well, "and the courtesies she had done."</p>
<p>"You did promise Powhatan," said Pocahontas, <lb/>
"what was yours should be his, and he the like to you. <lb/>
You called him father, being in his land a stranger, and <lb/>
by the same reason so must I do to you."</p>
<p>Captain Smith tried to excuse himself from this <lb/>
honour. He "durst not allow that title because she <lb/>
was a king's daughter."</p>
<p>"Were you not afraid," said Pocahontas, with a look <lb/>
of determination, "were you not afraid to come into <lb/>
my father's country, and caused fear in him and all <lb/>
his people but me, and fear you here I should call you <lb/>
father? I tell you then I will, and you shall call me <lb/>
<pb n="172" entity="b002082275_0197"/>
child, and so I will be forever and ever your countryman. <lb/>
They did tell us always you were dead, and I knew no <lb/>
other until I came to Plymouth; yet Powhatan did <reg orig="com-|mand">command</reg> <lb/>
Tomocomo to seek you and know the truth, <reg orig="be-|cause">because</reg> <lb/>
your countrymen will lie much."</p>
<p>Pocahontas had really felt a warm affection for Smith <lb/>
as a friend of her childhood.</p>
<p>Pocahontas, it is said, had been so well instructed <lb/>
that she "was become very formal and civil after our <lb/>
English manner." During his brief stay in London <lb/>
Captain Smith made frequent visits to Pocahontas, <lb/>
accompanied by courtiers and other friends who wished <lb/>
to see the Indian lady. The gentlemen, said Smith, <lb/>
"generally concluded they did not think God had a <lb/>
great hand in her conversion," and said that they had <lb/>
seen "many English ladies worse favoured, proportioned, <lb/>
and behavioured."</p>
<p>While Pocahontas was in England her portrait was <lb/>
drawn and engraved. She is represented in the <reg orig="fash-|ionable">fashionable</reg> <lb/>
costume of the day. Beneath the picture were <lb/>
these words: <lb/>
<q>Matoaks als Rebecka, daughter to the mighty Prince Powhatan, <lb/>
Emperor of Attanough-kornouck als Virginia, converted and <lb/>
baptised in the Christian faith, and wife to the worshipful Mr. <lb/>
John Rolfe. Aged 21. Anno Domini 1616.</q></p>
<p>Pocahontas was destined never to return to America. <lb/>
She died at Gravesend on the eve of her departure for <lb/>
America, being about twenty-two years of age. The few <lb/>
words devoted in Smith's History to her death are quite <lb/>
characteristic of the times: <lb/>
<q>It pleased God at Gravesend to take this young lady to His <lb/>
mercy, where she made not more sorrow for her unexpected death <lb/>
than joy to the beholders to hear and see her make so religious and <lb/>
godly an end.</q></p>
<pb n="173" entity="b002082275_0198"/>
<p>In the parish register at Gravesend is the following <lb/>
blundering entry, which could hardly have referred to <lb/>
any other than Pocahontas: <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l rend="indent">1616, May 2j, Rebecca Wrothe</l>
<l rend="indent">wyff of Thomas Wroth gent.</l>
<l>a Virginian lady borne, here was buried</l>
<l rend="indent2">in ye channcell.</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>The child of Pocahontas was left in England in the <lb/>
care of Sir Lewis Stewkley, and afterwards transferred <lb/>
to the care of his uncle, Mr. Henry Rolfe, a London <reg orig="mer-|chant">merchant</reg>. <lb/>
He was educated in England and afterwards <lb/>
returned to America. From him descended some of <lb/>
the most respectable families in Virginia. There is on <lb/>
record a petition signed by Pocahontas's son, Thomas <lb/>
Rolfe, and addressed to the authorities of the colony <lb/>
in 1641, praying to be allowed to go to the Indian <reg orig="coun-|try">country</reg> <lb/>
to visit his mother's sister, known among the white <lb/>
people as Cleopatra.</p>

FLORA MACDONALD</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">In the</hi> year 1745 Charles Edward, commonly <lb/>
called the "Young Pretender" to the throne of <lb/>
England and Scotland, landed in Scotland and raised <lb/>
the standard of revolt. He was followed by many of the <lb/>
Highland clans and also by certain of the Lowland. <lb/>
At the head of five thousand men he advanced into <reg orig="Eng-|land">England</reg>, <lb/>
but he was forced to retreat, and after the battle of <lb/>
Culloden became a fugitive from the pursuing English.</p>
<p>At last he found himself in the Islands of the Hebrides <lb/>
off the northwest coast of Scotland where he hoped to <lb/>
escape the vessels of war in search of him, and soldiers <lb/>
close upon his tracks, and to find a ship upon which he <lb/>
might sail to France. When, about the middle of May, <lb/>
1846, he reached the Island of South Uist, he and the <lb/>
two friends who clung to him, found themselves in a <lb/>
most miserable condition. They had lived for several <lb/>
days on dried fish and for still longer subject to <reg orig="inclem-|encies">inclemencies</reg> <lb/>
of weather. In South Uist they sought shelter <lb/>
of a friendly chief.</p>
<p>It required all the hospitable care of the Macdonald <lb/>
of Clanronald, who lived at a place called Ormaclade, <lb/>
to recruit and restore his visitors. A hut, built in a <lb/>
desolate spot among the neighbouring mountains was <lb/>
prepared for the royal adventurer where he awaited, <lb/>
under the friendly care, not only of the island's chief, <lb/>
but of every member of the chieftaincy, means of escape.</p>
<pb n="175" entity="b002082275_0200"/>
<p>When Charles made his appearance at the house of <lb/>
Clanronald, he was in tattered clothing and almost <lb/>
barefoot. Supplied with every necessary, though <reg orig="con-|demned">condemned</reg> <lb/>
to the shelter of a miserable shed, and fearing <lb/>
to stir beyond this humble abode, he yet recovered in <lb/>
a degree, his energies, and was strengthened enough to <lb/>
hear that there was no prospect of escape to France. <lb/>
In less time than he had realised, he beheld himself <lb/>
completely hemmed in by sea and land. Several ships of <lb/>
war guarded the coast, and a host of soldiers scoured <lb/>
every probable retreat where the object of their search <lb/>
could be concealed.</p>
<p>In this strait, the islanders, untutored and primitive <lb/>
as they were, vied with each other in giving assistance <lb/>
to their chieftain to preserve his guest's life. Although <lb/>
his retreat was perfectly well known to nearly every <lb/>
inhabitant of the island, neither man, woman nor child <lb/>
ever lisped the secret.</p>
<p>It chanced at this time that Flora, sister to the <lb/>
Macdonald of Milton, who also lived on the island, was <lb/>
upon a visit to her brother, and learned of the peril of the <lb/>
royal fugitive. When visiting her relatives at <reg orig="Orma-|clade">Ormaclade</reg>, <lb/>
this young lady, then in her twenty-fifth year, and <lb/>
possessed of a heroic spirit, became much interested <lb/>
in the visits of one of Charles's friends, O'Neil, to procure <lb/>
necessaries for the prince, and, before long, earnestly <lb/>
expressed her desire to be introduced to him, and to <lb/>
contribute to his escape. It seems that O'Neil had <reg orig="pre-|viously">previously</reg> <lb/>
met Flora, and, from the estimate he had formed <lb/>
of her capacity, led Charles's mind to dwell greatly <lb/>
upon engaging her assistance to rescue him from danger.</p>
<p>The stepfather of Miss Macdonald was, at that time, <lb/>
employed as commander of the very body of soldiers <lb/>
<pb n="176" entity="b002082275_0201"/>
engaged in the pursuit. He was obliged to act in <reg orig="obe-|dience">obedience</reg> <lb/>
to the chief of his clan, the laird of Sleat, which <lb/>
is the southern part of the island of Skye; but he secretly <lb/>
endeavoured to assist the fugitive, and was only too <lb/>
happy to afford silent consent to any plan which might <lb/>
be originated for his deliverance.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful June evening when Flora's wish <lb/>
to see the Prince was carried out. O'Neil joined her <lb/>
at the house of one of her brother's retainers, leaving <lb/>
his companion concealed, until he should engage Flora <lb/>
to consent to the plan he had in view. He proposed <lb/>
that she should disguise Charles as a female servant; <lb/>
and under pretext of travelling with her maid, conduct <lb/>
him in safety from Uist to the Isle of Skye; whence <lb/>
further measures could be taken to effect his escape.</p>
<p>This was a proposition that Flora's delicacy, as well <lb/>
as innate prudence, shrank from entertaining. She <lb/>
hesitated, avowing her distrust in the wildness of the <lb/>
scheme, and her fear of compromising her friends, <lb/>
Sir Alexander and Lady Margaret Macdonald, by taking <lb/>
the fugitive into their neighbourhood. O'Neil, <reg orig="how-|ever">however</reg>, <lb/>
with Irish tact, so worked upon the young lady's <lb/>
feelings, by leading forth his hapless Prince just at the <lb/>
right moment, that poor Flora's resolutions melted <lb/>
away before the sight of a figure so attenuated, and a <lb/>
countenance so filled by grief and despair, as those now <lb/>
presented to her gaze. She consented, after a brief <lb/>
interval.</p>
<p>When Flora first saw Charles all the brilliancy and <lb/>
promise of his first arrival had passed away, together <lb/>
with the charm of attractive exterior. Weeks of anxiety <lb/>
had taken the colour from his cheek and fire from his <lb/>
eve. Lack of food had made him emaciated. He was <lb/>
<pb n="177" entity="b002082275_0202"/>
no longer the bold aspirant for the throne of the Stuarts. <lb/>
He was the defeated, hunted scion of the ex-royal <lb/>
family, with a price upon his head.</p>
<p>Upon leaving the Prince, Miss Macdonald and her <lb/>
servant were seized by a band of militia; but difficulty <lb/>
was happily set aside by our heroine's discovery that <lb/>
the band was commanded by her stepfather. With <lb/>
little trouble she engaged his assistance, and obtained <lb/>
from him a pass for herself and her man-servant, Neil <lb/>
Mackechan, back to the Island of Skye, where her <lb/>
mother lived. Mention was also made in the passport, <lb/>
of a third person, an Irish domestic, named "Betty <lb/>
Burke," who was especially recommended by Captain <lb/>
Macdonald to his wife, as an "excellent spinner of flax, <lb/>
and a faithful servant." After getting this document, <lb/>
Flora's next care was to secure a boat, with a crew of <lb/>
six men, a supply of provisions, and last, but most <reg orig="im-|portant">important</reg> <lb/>
of all, the disguise intended to transform the <lb/>
elegant Prince Charles into a rough Irish maid-of-<reg orig="all-|work">all-work</reg>, <lb/>
and which consisted of a printed linen gown, <lb/>
a white apron and head gear.</p>
<p>The morning of the 27th of June was chosen for their <lb/>
departure, and, accompanied by Lady Clanronald, Miss <lb/>
Macdonald set out towards the seashore. They found <lb/>
the Prince roasting the liver of a sheep for his dinner, a <lb/>
sight which brought the reverses of fortune forcibly to <lb/>
their minds, and moved one of his gentle visitors to tears. <lb/>
That night an alarm, which drew the ladies back to the <lb/>
house, prevented the boat from starting; but the next <lb/>
evening, all being in readiness, the Prince assumed his <lb/>
linen gown and apron and, exchanging his sword for a <lb/>
good-sized walking-stick, embarked with his fair ally, <lb/>
her servant Mackechan. and six boatmen, for Skye.</p>
<pb n="178" entity="b002082275_0203"/>
<p>It was not one of pleasure, this voyage, to a young <lb/>
and delicate woman, considering the number of vessels <lb/>
lying all around, whose shots it would probably be <reg orig="diffi-|cult">difficult</reg> <lb/>
to avoid if suspicion were excited; the distance to <lb/>
be covered, thirty or forty miles, and the time, night. <lb/>
Soon rain began to fall; the skies and sea faded into one <lb/>
leaden expanse; the boatmen, wet and sulky, relapsed <lb/>
into perfect silence. The voice of the young Prince <lb/>
alone broke the stillness; and he, with a mixture of <lb/>
boyish vivacity and manly tact, told story after story, <lb/>
and sang snatches of song until he succeeded in <reg orig="dis-|pelling">dispelling</reg> <lb/>
the cloud of anxiety which oppressed his <reg orig="com-|panion">companion</reg>, <lb/>
less fearful for her own than for his safety. <lb/>
At length, overpowered by fatigue, Flora slept. Charles <lb/>
continued a long while singing, in the hope of lulling <lb/>
her to repose; and when, some time after, she awoke, <lb/>
she found him watching her with the greatest solicitude, <lb/>
endeavouring to screen her from the spray, and to <reg orig="pro-|tect">protect</reg> <lb/>
her from contact with the sails and cordage.</p>
<p>It must have been an unspeakable relief to the occu <lb/>
pants of that little boat when the first dim lines of light <lb/>
in the distant horizon announced the approach of <reg orig="morn-|ing">morning</reg>. <lb/>
When clear enough to distinguish objects, they <reg orig="dis-|covered">discovered</reg> <lb/>
that they were alone upon the ocean&mdash;no land <lb/>
in sight; but this gave little anxiety to the sailors, and <lb/>
after a short interval, during which the wind favoured <lb/>
their passage, the rocky coast of the mountainous Island <lb/>
of Skye appeared. As they were passing a headland <lb/>
called Vaternish, a party of the Macleod militia, espied <lb/>
them, and fired several shots. Happily, however, the <lb/>
tide was out, and before a boat would be got into deep <lb/>
water, pursuit was hopeless.</p>
<p>"Don't mind the villains, but pull for your lives," <lb/>
<pb n="179" entity="b002082275_0204"/>
cried the Prince, and the boatmen, animated by his <lb/>
address and courage, replied cheerily that they would <lb/>
soon distance their assailants; adding, that if they cared <lb/>
at all, it was only for him.</p>
<p>"Oh, there's no fear for me!" was the response, while <lb/>
the Prince busied himself in taking care of Flora, whom <lb/>
he had persuaded to take shelter in the bottom of the <lb/>
boat, a retreat which, to satisfy her fears, he himself <lb/>
adopted shortly after.</p>
<p>A few miles further, the boat was put into a creek, <lb/>
for the purpose of affording a little rest to the rowers, <lb/>
by this time greatly fatigued. They were soon, however, <lb/>
obliged to put off again, in consequence of being watched <lb/>
from the shore and, proceeding about twelve miles from <lb/>
Vaternish, they reached in safety, Mugstat, the residence <lb/>
of Sir Alexander Macdonald, formerly a staunch <reg orig="Jaco-|bite">Jacobite</reg>, <lb/>
or follower of the Stuarts, though now in actual <lb/>
attendance upon the Duke of Cumberland at Fort <lb/>
Augustus.</p>
<p>When the boat containing the fugitive Prince had <lb/>
landed, Flora, attended by Mackechan, proceeded to the <lb/>
house, leaving Charles, in his female dress, sitting on <lb/>
her trunk on the beach. On arriving at the dwelling, <lb/>
she desired a servant to inform Lady Margaret that she <lb/>
had called on her way home from Uist. She was <reg orig="imme-|diately">immediately</reg> <lb/>
introduced to the family apartment, where she <lb/>
found, besides Mrs. Macdonald of Kirkibost, a <reg orig="Lieu-|tenant">Lieutenant</reg> <lb/>
Macleod, the commander of militia stationed near, <lb/>
three or four members of which were also in the house. <lb/>
There was also present, Mr. Alexander Macdonald <lb/>
of Kingsburgh, an elderly gentleman of the <reg orig="neigh-|bourhood">neighbourhood</reg>, <lb/>
who acted as factor to Sir Alexander, and <lb/>
who was, she knew, a sound Jacobite.</p>
<pb n="180" entity="b002082275_0205"/>
<p>Flora entered easily into conversation with the <reg orig="offi-|cer">officer</reg>, <lb/>
who asked her a number of questions; where she <lb/>
had come from, where she was going, and so forth; all <lb/>
of which she answered without manifesting the least <lb/>
trace of confusion which might have been expected <lb/>
from a young lady under such circumstances. The same <lb/>
man had been in the custom of examining every boat <lb/>
which landed from Long Island; that, for instance, in <lb/>
which Mrs. Macdonald of Kirkibost arrived had been <lb/>
so examined, and we can only account for his allowing <lb/>
that of Miss Flora to pass by the circumstance of his <lb/>
meeting her under the courtesies of the drawing-room <lb/>
of a lady.</p>
<p>Miss Macdonald, with the same self-possession, <lb/>
dined in Lieutenant Macleod's company. Seizing a <lb/>
proper opportunity, she apprised Kingsburgh of the <lb/>
circumstances of the Prince, and he immediately <reg orig="pro-|ceeded">proceeded</reg> <lb/>
to another room, and sent for Lady Margaret, <lb/>
that he might break the intelligence to her in private. <lb/>
Notwithstanding the previous warning, she was much <lb/>
alarmed at the idea of the wanderer being so near her <lb/>
house, and immediately sent for a certain Donald Roy <lb/>
Macdonald, to consult as to what should be done. <lb/>
Donald had been wounded in the Prince's army at <lb/>
Culloden, and was as obnoxious to the Government as <lb/>
he could be. He came and joined the lady and her <lb/>
friends in the garden, when it was arranged that <reg orig="Kings-|burgh">Kingsburgh</reg> <lb/>
should take the Prince along with him to his own <lb/>
house, some miles distant, and thence pass him through <lb/>
the island to Portree, where Donald Roy should take him <lb/>
up, and provide for his further safety.</p>
<p>No time was lost in dispatching Kingsburgh to <reg orig="com-|municate">communicate</reg> <lb/>
these arrangements to the Prince, and to carry <lb/>
<pb n="181" entity="b002082275_0206"/>
him some refreshment. The poor refugee, seeing some <lb/>
one approaching him, started up, and discovering the <lb/>
heavy stick he carried, put himself in an attitude of <reg orig="de-|fiance">defiance</reg>.</p>
<p>"I am Macdonald of Kingsburgh, come to serve <lb/>
Your Highness," said the old man; and he proceeded to <lb/>
explain how this might be effected.</p>
<p>While these two set off toward Kingsburgh, Miss <lb/>
Macdonald quietly seated with Lady Margaret and <lb/>
the officer before named, endeavoured to secure to them <lb/>
a good start upon their journey. Presently she bade <lb/>
farewell to her hostess, who pretended to be extremely <lb/>
averse to parting with her so soon, and invited her <lb/>
warmly to remain; reminding her that she had promised <lb/>
to pay her a lengthened visit. Flora excused herself, <lb/>
upon the plea that her mother was ill, and needed her <lb/>
presence at home. After dinner, therefore, she <reg orig="de-|parted">departed</reg>, <lb/>
leaving young Macleod quite unsuspicious of <lb/>
the real nature of her visit to Mugstat. In after years <lb/>
Flora often rallied this gentleman upon having so <reg orig="com-|pletely">completely</reg> <lb/>
deceived him.</p>
<p>Mrs. Macdonald of Kirkibost, her servants, and <lb/>
Mackechan, accompanied Flora, whose object was to <lb/>
come up with the pedestrians and, joining them, to <lb/>
proceed all together to Kingsburgh. They soon <reg orig="ap-|peared">appeared</reg> <lb/>
in sight; but as the servants of her companion <lb/>
were unacquainted with the secret, it was necessary <lb/>
to put them off the scent by passing the travellers, as <lb/>
if unknown to them, at a trot. Charles is represented <lb/>
as being very awkward in his feminine attire: <reg orig="Kings-|burgh">Kingsburgh</reg> <lb/>
laughed and said to him.</p>
<p>"Your enemies call you a Pretender; but if you be, <lb/>
I can tell you, you are the worst at the trade I ever saw."</p>
<pb n="182" entity="b002082275_0207"/>
<p>He held up his petticoats in a very undignified <reg orig="man-|ner">manner</reg>; <lb/>
and when remonstrated with, improved upon <lb/>
matters by permitting the skirts of his dress to draggle <lb/>
in the water, when a brook again had to be passed. <lb/>
His height was so remarkable, and his strides so <reg orig="im-|mense">immense</reg>, <lb/>
that the maid-servant at Flora's side exclaimed <lb/>
to her:</p>
<p>"That must be an Irishwoman, or else a man in <lb/>
woman's clothes; see what steps the creature takes!"</p>
<p>Flora replied that she was doubtless an Irishwoman. <lb/>
Shortly after they parted company, and Flora rejoined <lb/>
the travellers, who had been somewhat annoyed on their <lb/>
side by the inquiries and remarks as to the uncommon <lb/>
heighth of the pretended Betty Burke. About eleven <lb/>
o'clock at night, the little party arrived in safety at <lb/>
Kingsburgh House, where Mrs. Macdonald received <lb/>
them.</p>
<p>Supper followed, Charles, still in gown and coif, <reg orig="pre-|siding">presiding</reg>, <lb/>
with his hostess on his left hand, and Flora in <lb/>
the place of honour. After supper the ladies <reg orig="with-|drew">withdrew</reg> <lb/>
to discuss past perils and future plans.</p>
<p>"And what," said Lady Kingsburgh, "has been <lb/>
done with the boatmen who brought you to the island?"</p>
<p>"They have been sent back to South Uist," replied <lb/>
the young lady.</p>
<p>"That was an oversight. These men ought to have <lb/>
been detained a short time. I fear that if they meet <lb/>
with Government officers, they may incautiously, or <lb/>
for money, betray our poor wanderer's retreat."</p>
<p>Lady Kingsburgh's surmise, which had even at that <lb/>
early period proved correct, seemed so alarming, that <lb/>
Flora decided upon persuading the Prince to assume <lb/>
as soon at possible, the dress of his own sex.</p>
<pb n="183" entity="b002082275_0208"/>
<p>The hunted Prince had now been several days without <lb/>
taking off his clothes or enjoying the luxury of a bed. <lb/>
He was only too happy to retire to the one provided for <lb/>
him, and it was now far into the night. He slept until <lb/>
late the following morning, so late, indeed, that Miss <lb/>
Macdonald went into Kingsburgh's room, and urged <lb/>
him to rouse the Prince, and depart with him, lest a <lb/>
party of militia should arrive, and make it impossible <lb/>
to leave the house.</p>
<p>Kingsburgh, however, would by no means consent <lb/>
to disturb the weary outcast he had so generously <lb/>
sheltered. "Let the poor boy sleep after his fatigues," <lb/>
he said. "As for me, I care little if they rake off this <lb/>
old gray head, ten or eleven years sooner than I should <lb/>
die in the course of nature." Saying these words, he <lb/>
turned again to his pillow, and was asleep in a moment.</p>
<p>Toward afternoon the party again set forward, but <lb/>
previously Kingsburgh had provided the Prince with a <lb/>
new pair of shoes, his own being completely worn out. <lb/>
"Look," said this enthusiastic Jacobite, holding up <lb/>
the old ones, "I shall faithfully keep these shoes until <lb/>
you are comfortably settled at St. James. I will then <lb/>
introduce myself by shaking them at you, and thus put <lb/>
you in mind of your night's entertainment and <reg orig="protec-|tion">protection</reg> <lb/>
under this roof."</p>
<p>"Be as good as your word, my friend," replied the <lb/>
Prince "whenever that time arrives I shall expect to <lb/>
see you."</p>
<p>It was judged better that, as Flora had come with <lb/>
a female servant, she should take one away with her; <lb/>
so Charles waited to alter his dress until they reached <lb/>
a little wood upon the road to Portree, when he again <lb/>
assumed his male attire, exchanging his petticoat and <lb/>
<pb n="184" entity="b002082275_0209"/>
apron for a tartan coat and waistcoat, a philibeg and <lb/>
short hose, plaid and bonnet. Kingsburgh here bade <lb/>
adieu to the Prince, who, with Mackeckan, was to walk <lb/>
a distance of fourteen miles to Portree, while to avoid <lb/>
suspicion, Flora proceeded thither by another road. <lb/>
Arriving at Portree, Flora detained him no longer than <lb/>
to bid him an earnest, though agitated, farewell. Charles <lb/>
thanked her, in the most animated terms, for all the <lb/>
heroism she had shown in his cause.</p>
<p>"Ah! madam," he said, with emotion, "for all that <lb/>
has happened, I hope we shall meet in St. James's yet."</p>
<p>This was the last time Charles ever saw his generous <lb/>
protectress. They hurried him away to the vessel, <lb/>
while Flora, with a heavy heart, turned her steps toward <lb/>
the house of her mother at Sleat. She had effected <lb/>
all in her power, she had used her best exertions to <lb/>
secure the safety of this, the last unfortunate scion of <lb/>
the old Stuart line, and to Heaven she commended <lb/>
the rest. What vicissitudes the wretched Charles <reg orig="en-|countered">encountered</reg>, <lb/>
how he lay, pinched with hunger, and <reg orig="fail-|ing">failing</reg> <lb/>
in health, in cowsheds, in caves and among bushes <lb/>
and underwood until, three months after, he was able <lb/>
to embark from Lochnanuagh, the very spot where he <lb/>
had landed, and to effect his escape to France, is well <lb/>
known in history. It is probable that, after the part <lb/>
she had taken, after the dangers she had boldly <reg orig="con-|fronted">confronted</reg> <lb/>
in the endeavour to secure his escape, Flora <lb/>
Macdonald's thoughts were with the fugitive constantly; <lb/>
nor is it to be supposed she ever enjoyed a moment of <lb/>
actual peace of mind until the news of his safe arrival <lb/>
in Brittany reached her.</p>
<p>Flora Macdonald, after quitting the Prince, <reg orig="pro-|ceeded">proceeded</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="185" entity="b002082275_0210"/>
to the house of her mother. Upon her arrival, <lb/>
she checked the confidence which she would otherwise <lb/>
have gladly made, relative to her late employment, <reg orig="fear-|ing">fearing</reg> <lb/>
to involve others in the danger she herself had incurred. <lb/>
She considered it better, if inquiries were made, that <lb/>
they should be able to declare nothing had been known <lb/>
to them of the Prince's escape. That such inquiries <lb/>
would arise, Flora felt assured; and the result proved <lb/>
how correct was her anticipation. It was only a day <lb/>
or two before she heard that the boatmen, on reaching <lb/>
the island whence they had conveyed the fugitives, <lb/>
had been intimidated into revealing the place where <lb/>
they had left her. A Captain Ferguson, a Government <lb/>
emissary, obtaining the description of "Betty Burke's" <lb/>
appearance, sailed at once for Skye, and finding no <lb/>
"tall female" had been seen there with Miss Macdonald, <lb/>
followed upon the latter's track to Kingsburgh, where <lb/>
he soon discovered from the servants, that the supposed <lb/>
Irish domestic had reappeared, and been accommodated <lb/>
with the best bedchamber in the house. The good old <lb/>
Kingsburgh refusing to give further information, was <lb/>
laid in durance, and threatened with no punishment <lb/>
short of death; while the attendance of Miss Macdonald <lb/>
was commanded without loss of time. In opposition <lb/>
to the advice of her family, Flora wisely determined to <lb/>
obey the summons. On her way she met her stepfather, <lb/>
but was almost immediately after seized by a party of <lb/>
soldiers, and taken to the vessel of the Captain Ferguson <lb/>
named above. Meeting on board General Campbell, <lb/>
she frankly confessed to him the truth of the statement <lb/>
made by her boatmen, and quietly resigned herself <lb/>
prisoner.</p>
<p>It will be remembered that Charles's friend, and <lb/>
<pb n="186" entity="b002082275_0211"/>
ardent admirer&mdash;his only follower, indeed, at that time&mdash; <lb/>
was Captain O'Neil, the one who had first, form some <lb/>
slight acquaintance with Flora, suggested her aid, and, <lb/>
succeeded in gaining it. On board the ship to which. <lb/>
after twenty-tow days Flora was sent, she found this <lb/>
generous and lively young Irishman also a prisoner, <lb/>
and going straight up to him, she tapped him gently <lb/>
with her hand, and said laughingly, "To that black <lb/>
countenance, it seems, I am to owe all my misfortunes." <lb/>
He replied earnestly: "Ah! do not regard as a <reg orig="misfor-|tune">misfortune</reg> <lb/>
what is the brightest honour; only go on as you <lb/>
have begun; neither repent nor be ashamed of what will <lb/>
yet redound to your greatest praise and advantage." <lb/>
This exhortation must have been needless to one of our <lb/>
heroine's temperament.</p>
<p>Owing to the courtesy of those in authority, Flora <lb/>
experienced as well in the ship of Commodore Smith <lb/>
as on board the <hi rend="italic">Bridgewater,</hi> her next prison, the <reg orig="great-|est">greatest</reg> <lb/>
kindness and indulgence. She was permitted to <lb/>
land and bid her mother farewell, to engage a Scotch <lb/>
attendant, the only girl who could be induced to <reg orig="accom-|pany">accompany</reg> <lb/>
her, and to secure a portion of her wardrobe, she <lb/>
having been some time deprived of a change of clothing. <lb/>
On arriving at Leith she remained nearly tow months <lb/>
in harbour, and was allowed to receive visitors on board, <lb/>
though she was not allowed to leave the ship. The <lb/>
simple-minded country maiden suddenly discovered <lb/>
that she had been transformed into a heroine The <lb/>
fame of her courage had gone far and wide; everybody <lb/>
was anxious to see her. Many brought presents, and <lb/>
one a Bible and Prayer Book, together with sewing <lb/>
materials, which she joyfully received, It is related <lb/>
that Lady Mary Cochrane paid her a visit, and upon <lb/>
<pb n="187" entity="b002082275_0212"/>
the wind freshening a little, pretended fear of returning <lb/>
to shore, in order that she might, as she said, be able <lb/>
to say she had spent the night with Miss Flora <reg orig="Mac-|donald">Macdonald</reg>.</p>
<p>Arrived in London, Miss Macdonald was placed in <lb/>
the house of a gentleman, where she could scarcely be <lb/>
said to be put under restraint of any disagreeable nature. <lb/>
Here she remained for several months, and upon the <lb/>
passing of the Act of Indemnity, in July of the year, <lb/>
1747, was set at liberty without the ceremony of a trial. <lb/>
Public opinion was wholly in her favour, and many in <lb/>
power, Frederick, Prince of Wales, father of George III., <lb/>
among the number, made no secret of their approbation <lb/>
of her conduct under the affecting circumstances in <lb/>
which the unhappy Charles Edward had sought her aid.</p>
<p>Shortly after her return home, on November 6, <lb/>
1750, she was married to young Macdonald, the son <lb/>
of the generous Kingsburgh, and became the mother <lb/>
of five sons, more or less remarkable for the courage and <lb/>
intrepidity ennobling their ancestry on both sides.</p>
<p>When Dr. Johnson went with Boswell to the Hebrides, <lb/>
in the year 1773, he was warmly received by the husband <lb/>
of Flora, then himself possessor of the family mansion <lb/>
in which Charles Edward had been successfully hidden. <lb/>
"Kingsburgh," says Boswell, in his account of the <lb/>
great moralist's tour, "is completely the figure of a <reg orig="gal-|lant">gallant</reg> <lb/>
Highlander, exhibiting the graceful mien and manly <lb/>
looks which our popular Scotch song has justly attributed <lb/>
to that character. He had jet black hair which was tied <lb/>
behind, and was a large, stately man, with a steady <lb/>
sensible countenance." Flora herself he describes as a <lb/>
woman of middle stature, soft features, gently manners, <lb/>
and elegant presence. She was, at this time fifty-three <lb/>
<pb n="188" entity="b002082275_0213"/>
year old. Lady Kingsburgh spelled her name not <lb/>
"Flora," but "Flory" Macdonald.</p>
<p>The year following this visit of the doctor, the <reg orig="Kings-|burghs">Kingsburghs</reg> <lb/>
emigrated to North Carolina, in the hope of <lb/>
effecting a comfortable settlement in America. Their <lb/>
journey was not a fortunate one. The husband of <lb/>
Flora, who appears to have been as brave as ever in <lb/>
the cause he embraced, joining the 84th Royal <reg orig="High-|land">Highland</reg> <lb/>
Emigrant Regiment, was imprisoned by the <reg orig="pro-|vincial">provincial</reg> <lb/>
force; But he was soon set at liberty, and he then <lb/>
joined the North Carolina Highlanders, serving in <lb/>
Canada. Upon the conclusion of the war he returned <lb/>
to Scotland, probably wearied of the incessant harass <lb/>
he had experienced in the New World, and yearning <lb/>
for a sight of his native land. During their homeward <lb/>
voyage the ship was attacked by a French privateer. <lb/>
It would scarcely be in character to suppose our heroine <lb/>
a silent or impassive spectator of the combat. While <lb/>
standing on deck near her husband, and boldly animating <lb/>
the sailors by spirited words and gestures, which even <lb/>
in her old age seemed to have lost nothing of their power, <lb/>
she was thrown down with such violence that the shock <lb/>
borke her arm. In allusion to this accident and the <reg orig="cir-|cumstances">circumstances</reg> <lb/>
of it, she is said to have remarked with <lb/>
great coolness, that "she had now suffered a little for <lb/>
both the houses of Stuart and Hanover."</p>
<p>After her return to Skye, Flora never again left it. <lb/>
She lived to be quite an old woman, and her body was <lb/>
followed to the grave by about three thousand persons, <lb/>
friends and retainers, amongst whom many had been <lb/>
recipients of her bounty, and most were capable of <lb/>
estimating the fine qualities of heart and mind which <lb/>
rendered her death a public loss. Besides her sons, <lb/>
<pb n="189" entity="b002082275_0214"/>
all of them officers in the army or navy, Flora Mandonald <lb/>
had two daughters, who were married to gentlemen <lb/>
following the same profession as their brothers. One <lb/>
of the sons, anxious to perpetuate the remembrance of <lb/>
the spot where so heroic and devoted a mortal was <lb/>
buried, sent a marble tablet, commemorative of his <lb/>
mother, to be placed upon her tomb in the churchyard <lb/>
of Kilmuir; but this having been broken by accident, <lb/>
tourists took the opportunity to carry off pieces and, <lb/>
at the present time the grave a Flora Macdonald <lb/>
remains unsdistinguished within the rude inclosure <lb/>
that holds the dust of so many of the brave Kingsburgh <lb/>
family.</p>

MADAME ROLAND</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">In the</hi> year 1754 there was living in an obscure <reg orig="work-|shop">workshop</reg> <lb/>
in Paris, an engraver by the name of Gratien <lb/>
Phlippon. He had married a very beautiful woman, <lb/>
whose placid temperament and cheerful content <reg orig="con-|trasted">contrasted</reg> <lb/>
strikingly with the restlessness of her husband. <lb/>
The comfortable yet humble apartments of the <reg orig="en-|graver">engraver</reg> <lb/>
were over the shop where he plied his daily toil. <lb/>
He was much dissatisfied with his lowly condition in <lb/>
life, and that his family, in the enjoyment of frugal <reg orig="com-|petence">competence</reg> <lb/>
alone, were debarred form those luxuries which <lb/>
were profusely showered upon others. Bitterly and <lb/>
unceasingly he murmured that his lot had been cast in <lb/>
the ranks of obscurity and of unsparing labour, while <lb/>
others, by a more fortunate, although no better merited <lb/>
destiny, were born to ease and affluence, and honour and <lb/>
luxury. Phlippon was a philosopher. Submission was <lb/>
a virtue he had never learned, and never wished to <lb/>
learn.</p>
<p>Madame Phlippon was just the reverse of her <reg orig="hus-|band">husband</reg>. <lb/>
She was a woman in whom faith, and trust, and <lb/>
submission predominated. She surrendered her will, <lb/>
without questioning, to all the teachings of the Church. <lb/>
She was placid, contented and cheerful, and <reg orig="un-|doubtedly">undoubtedly</reg> <lb/>
sincere in her piety. In every event of <lb/>
life she recognised the overruling hand of Providence, <lb/>
and feeling that the comparatively humble lot assigned <lb/>
<pb n="191" entity="b002082275_0216"/>
her was in accordance with the will of God, she <reg orig="in-|dulged">indulged</reg> <lb/>
in no repinings.</p>
<p>Of eight children born to these parents, one only, <lb/>
Jeanne Manon or Jane Mary, survived the hour of <lb/>
birth. Her father first received her to his arms in 1754, <lb/>
and she became the object of his painful and most <reg orig="pas-|sionate">passionate</reg> <lb/>
adoration. Both parents lived in her and for her. <lb/>
She was their earthly all. Even in her infantile years <lb/>
she gave indication of a most brilliant intellect&mdash;and <lb/>
her father repined that she should be doomed to a life <lb/>
of obscurity and toil, while the garden of the Tuileries <lb/>
and the Elysian Fields were thronged with children, <lb/>
neither so beautiful nor so intelligent, who were <reg orig="revel-|ing">reveling</reg> <lb/>
in boundless wealth, and living in a world of <lb/>
luxury and splendour which, to Phlippon's imagination, <lb/>
seemed more alluring than any idea he could form of <lb/>
heaven.</p>
<p>By nature Jane was endowed with a soul of unusual <lb/>
delicacy. From early childhood, all that is beautiful <lb/>
or sublime in nature, in literature, in character, had <lb/>
charms to rivet her entranced attention. She loved to <lb/>
sit alone at her chamber window in the evening of a <lb/>
summer's day, to gaze upon the gorgeous hues of <reg orig="sun-|set">sunset</reg>. <lb/>
Books of poetry and descriptions of heroic <reg orig="char-|acter">character</reg> <lb/>
and achievements were her especial delight. <lb/>
"Plutarch's Lives," that book which, more than any other, <lb/>
appears to be the incentive of early genius, was hid <lb/>
beneath her pillow, and read and re-read. Those <reg orig="illus-|trious">illustrious</reg> <lb/>
heroes of antiquity became the companions of <lb/>
her solitude and of her hourly thoughts. She adored <lb/>
them and loved them as her own most intimate <reg orig="per-|sonal">personal</reg> <lb/>
friends. Her character became insensibly moulded <lb/>
to their forms, and she was inspired with restless <reg orig="enthu-|siasm">enthusiasm</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="192" entity="b002082275_0217"/>
to imitate their deeds. When but twelve years <lb/>
of age her father found her, one day, weeping that she <lb/>
was not born a Roman maiden.</p>
<p>It was, perhaps, the absence of playmates, and the <lb/>
habitual converse with mature minds which, at so early <lb/>
an age, inspired Jane with that insatiate thirst for <lb/>
knowledge which she ever manifested. Books were <lb/>
her only resource in every unoccupied hour. From her <lb/>
walks with her father, and her domestic employments <lb/>
with her mother, she turned to her little library and to <lb/>
her chamber window, and lost herself in the limitless <lb/>
realms of thought.</p>
<p>In a bright summer's afternoon she might be seen <lb/>
sauntering along the boulevards, led by her father's <lb/>
hand, gazing upon that scene of gaiety with which the <lb/>
eye is never wearied. A gilded coach, drawn by the <lb/>
most beautiful horses in the richest trappings, sweeps <lb/>
along the streets&mdash;a gorgeous vision. Phlippon takes <lb/>
his little daughter in his arms to show her the sight, and, <lb/>
as she gazes in infantile wonder and delight, the <lb/>
discontented father says:</p>
<p>"Look at that lord and lady, and child, lolling so <lb/>
voluptuously in their coach. They have no right there. <lb/>
Why must I and my child walk on this hot pavement, <lb/>
while they repose on velvet cushions and revel in all <lb/>
luxury? A time will come when the people will awake <lb/>
to the consciousness of their wrongs, and their tyrants <lb/>
will tremble before them."</p>
<p>He continues his walk in moody silence, brooding <lb/>
over his sense of injustice. They return to their home.</p>
<p>Jane wishes that her father kept a carriage, and <reg orig="liv-|eried">liveried</reg> <lb/>
servants and outriders. She thinks of politics, <lb/>
and of the tyranny of kings and nobles, and of the unjust <lb/>
<pb n="193" entity="b002082275_0218"/>
inequalities of man. She retires to the solitude of her <lb/>
loved chamber window, and reads of Aristides the Just, <lb/>
of Themistocles with his Spartan virtues, of Brutus, and <lb/>
of the mother of the Gracchi. Greece and Rome rise <lb/>
before her in all their ancient renown. She despises the <lb/>
frivolity of Paris and her youthful bosom throbs with <lb/>
the desire of being noble in spirit and of achieving great <lb/>
exploits. Thus, when other children of her age were <lb/>
playing with their dolls, she was dreaming of the <reg orig="pros-|tration">prostration</reg> <lb/>
of nobles and of the overthrow of thrones.</p>
<p>The education of young ladies, at that time in France, <lb/>
was conducted almost exclusively by nuns in convents. <lb/>
The idea of the silence and solitude of the cloister <reg orig="in-|spired">inspired</reg> <lb/>
the highly imaginative girl. Her mother's spirit <lb/>
of religion was exerting a powerful influence over her, <lb/>
and one evening she fell at her mother's feet and, <reg orig="burst-|ing">bursting</reg> <lb/>
into tears, besought that she might be sent to a <lb/>
convent to prepare to receive her first Christian <reg orig="com-|munion">communion</reg> <lb/>
in a suitable frame of mind.</p>
<p>The convent of the sisterhood of the Congregation in <lb/>
Paris was selected for Jane. She subsequently wrote: <lb/>
<q>While pressing my dear mother in my arms, at the moment <lb/>
of parting with her for the first time in my life, I thought my <lb/>
heart would break; but I was acting in obedience to the voice <lb/>
of God, and I passed the threshold of the cloister, tearfully <reg orig="offer-|ing">offering</reg> <lb/>
up to him the greatest sacrifice I was capable of making. <lb/>
This was on the 7th of May, 1765, when I was eleven years and <lb/>
two months old. The first night I spent in the convent was a night <lb/>
of agitation. I was no longer under the paternal roof. I was at a <lb/>
distance from that kind mother,who was doubtless thinking of me <lb/>
with affectionate emotion. A dim light diffused through the <lb/>
room in which I had been put to bed with four children of my <lb/>
own age. I stole softly form my couch and drew near the <reg orig="win-|dow">window</reg>, <lb/>
the light of the moon enabling me to distinguish the garden, <lb/>
which it overlooked. The deepest silence prevailed around, and <lb/>
<pb n="194" entity="b002082275_0219"/>
I listened to it, if I may use the expression, with a sort of respect. <lb/>
Lofty trees cast their gigantic shadows along the ground and <lb/>
promised a secure asylum to meditation. I lifted up my eyes to <lb/>
the heavens; they were unclouded and serene. I imagined that <lb/>
I felt the presence of the Deity smiling upon my sacrifice, and <lb/>
already offering me a reward in the hope of a celestial abode <lb/>
Tears of delight flowed down my cheeks. I repeated my vows <lb/>
with holy ecstasy, and went to bed again to taste the slumber of <lb/>
God's chosen children.</q></p>
<p>Two years after this she was taken to pass a week <lb/>
at the luxurious abodes of Maria Antoinette. Versailles <lb/>
was in itself a city of palaces and of courtiers, where <lb/>
all that could dazzle the eye in regal pomp and <reg orig="volup-|tuousness">voluptuousness</reg> <lb/>
was concentred. Most girls of her age <lb/>
would have been enchanted and bewildered by this <lb/>
display. Jane was permitted to witness, and <reg orig="par-|tially">partially</reg> <lb/>
to share, all the pomp of luxuriously spread tables <lb/>
and presentations, and court balls, and illuminations <lb/>
and the gilded equipages of ambassadors and princes, <lb/>
but this maiden, just emerging from the period of <reg orig="child-|hood">childhood</reg> <lb/>
and the seclusion of the cloister, undazzled by all <lb/>
this brilliance, looked sadly on the scene. The servility <lb/>
of the courtiers excited her contempt. She contrasted <lb/>
the boundless profusion and extravagance which filled <lb/>
these palaces with the absence of comfort in the dwellings <lb/>
of the over-taxed poor and pondered deeply the value <lb/>
of that despotism which starved the millions to pander <lb/>
to the dissolute indulgence of the few. Her personal <lb/>
pride was also severely stung by perceiving that her <lb/>
own attractions, mental and physical, were entirely <lb/>
overlooked by the crowds which were bowing before <lb/>
power. Disgusted with the frivolity of the living she <lb/>
sought solace in companionship with the illustrious <lb/>
dead. She chose the gardens for her resort and, <reg orig="lin-|gered">lingered</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="195" entity="b002082275_0220"/>
around the statues which embellished scenes of <lb/>
almost fairy enchantment.</p>
<p>"How do you enjoy your visit, my daughter?" <reg orig="in-|quired">inquired</reg> <lb/>
her mother.</p>
<p>"I shall be glad when it is ended," was the <reg orig="charac-|teristic">characteristic</reg> <lb/>
reply,"else, in a few more days, I shall so detest <lb/>
all the persons I see that I shall not known what to do <lb/>
with my hatred."</p>
<p>"Why, what harm have these persons done you, <lb/>
my child?"</p>
<p>"They make me feel injustice and look upon <reg orig="absurd-|ity">absurdity</reg>," <lb/>
replied this philosopher of thirteen.</p>
<p>Soon after this Jane entered her fourteenth year and <lb/>
her mother, conscious of the importance to her child <lb/>
of a knowledge of domestic duties,took her to the market <lb/>
to obtain meat and vegetables, and occasionally placed <lb/>
upon her the responsibility of the family purchases. <lb/>
The unaffected dignity with which the imaginative girl <lb/>
yielded herself to these most prosaic avocations was such, <lb/>
that when she entered the market, the fruit women <lb/>
hastened to serve her. It is quite remarkable that <lb/>
Jane, apparently, never turned with repugnance from <lb/>
these humble avocations of domestic life. It speaks <lb/>
most highly in behalf of the sound judgment of her <lb/>
mother, that she was enabled thus successfully to allure <lb/>
her daughter from her realms of romance to those <reg orig="un-|attractive">unattractive</reg> <lb/>
practical duties which our daily necessities <lb/>
demand. At one hour this ardent maiden might have been <lb/>
seen in her little chamber absorbed in studies of deepest <lb/>
research. The highest themes which can elevate the <lb/>
mind of man claimed her delighted reveries. The next <lb/>
hour she might be seen in the kitchen, under the <reg orig="guid-|ance">guidance</reg> <lb/>
of her mother, receiving from her judicious lips <lb/>
<pb n="196" entity="b002082275_0221"/>
lessons upon frugality, and industry, and economy, <lb/>
The white apron was bound around her waist, and <lb/>
her hands, which, but a few moments before, were busy <lb/>
with the circles of the celestial globe, were now <reg orig="occu-|pied">occupied</reg> <lb/>
in preparing vegetables for dinner. There was <lb/>
thus united in the character of Jane the appreciation of <lb/>
all that is beautiful and sublime in the world of fact <lb/>
and the world of imagination, and also domestic skill <lb/>
and practical common sense. She was thus prepared <lb/>
to fascinate by the graces of a refined and polished <lb/>
mind, and to create for herself, in the midst of all <reg orig="vicis-|situdes">vicissitudes</reg>, <lb/>
a region of loveliness in which her spirit could <lb/>
ever dwell; and, at the same time she possessed that <lb/>
sagacity and tact, and those habits of usefulness, which <lb/>
prepared her to meet calmly all the changes of fortune, <lb/>
and over them all to triumph. With that self-<reg orig="apprecia-|tion">appreciation</reg> <lb/>
which with her was frankness rather than vanity <lb/>
she subsequently writes: <lb/>
<q>This mixture of serious studies, agreeable relaxations and <lb/>
domestic cares, was rendered pleasant by my mother's good <lb/>
management, and fitted me for everything. It seemed to <reg orig="fore-|bode">forebode</reg> <lb/>
the vicissitudes of future life, and enabled me to bear them. <lb/>
In every place I am at home. I can prepare my own dinner <lb/>
with as much address as Philop&oelig;men cut wood; but no one <lb/>
seeing me thus engaged would think it an office in which I ought <lb/>
to be employed.</q></p>
<p>As years passed on through the friendship of a family of <lb/>
noble rank, Jane was often introduced to the great world. <lb/>
The family became much interested in the fascinating <lb/>
young lady, and her brilliant talents and <reg orig="accomplish-|ments">accomplishments</reg> <lb/>
secured her invitations to many social interviews. <lb/>
This slight acquaintance with the nobility of France <lb/>
did not, however, elevate them in her esteem. She <lb/>
<pb n="197" entity="b002082275_0222"/>
found the conversation of the old marquises and <reg orig="anti-|quated">antiquated</reg> <lb/>
dowagers who frequented the saloon of Madame <lb/>
De Boismorel more insipid and illiterate than that of <lb/>
the tradespeople who visited her father's shop, and <lb/>
upon whom these nobles looked down with contempt. <lb/>
Jane was also disgusted with the many indications she <lb/>
saw, not only of indolence, but of dissipation and utter <lb/>
want of principle. Her good sense enabled her to move <lb/>
among these people as a studious observer of human <lb/>
nature, neither adopting their costume nor imitating <lb/>
their manners. She was very unostentatious and <reg orig="sim-|ple">simple</reg> <lb/>
in her dress, and never, in the slightest degree, <lb/>
affected the mannerism of mindless and artless fashion.</p>
<p>Madame De Boismorel, at one time eulogising her <lb/>
taste in these respects, remarked:</p>
<p>"You do not love feathers, do you, Miss Phlippon? <lb/>
How very different you are from the giddy-headed <lb/>
girls around us!"</p>
<p>"I never wear feathers," Jane replied, "because I <lb/>
do not think that they would correspond with the <reg orig="con-|dition">condition</reg> <lb/>
in life of an artist's daughter who is going about <lb/>
on foot."</p>
<p>"But were you in a different situation in life, would <lb/>
you then wear feathers?"</p>
<p>"I do not know what I should do in that case. I <lb/>
attach very slight importance to such trifles. I merely <lb/>
consider what is suitable for myself, and should be very <lb/>
sorry to judge of others by the superficial information <lb/>
afforded by their dress."</p>
<p>M. Phlippon now began to advance rapidly in a career <lb/>
of dissipation. Jane did everything in her power to <lb/>
lure him to love his home. All her efforts were <reg orig="una-|vailing">unavailing</reg>. <lb/>
Her situation was now painful in the extreme. <lb/>
<pb n="198" entity="b002082275_0223"/>
Her mother, who had been the guardian angel of her <lb/>
life, was sleeping in the grave. The father was daily <lb/>
becoming more neglectful and unkind to his daughter. <lb/>
Under these circumstances, Jane, by the advice of <lb/>
friends, had resort to a legal process, by which there <lb/>
was secured to her, from the wreck of her mother's <lb/>
fortune, an annual income of about one hundred dollars.</p>
<p>In these gloomy hours which clouded the morning <lb/>
of her day, Jane found and unfailing resource and solace <lb/>
in her love of literature. With pen in hand, extracting <lb/>
beautiful passages and expanding suggested thoughts, <lb/>
she forgot her griefs and beguiled many hours, which <lb/>
would otherwise have been burdened with <reg orig="wretched-|ness">wretchedness</reg>.</p>
<p>Maria Antoinette, woe-worn and weary, in tones of <lb/>
despair uttered the exclamation:</p>
<p>"Oh! what a resource amid the casualties of life <lb/>
must there be in a highly cultivated mind."</p>
<p>The maiden could utter the same exclamation in accents <lb/>
of joy.</p>
<p>When Jane was in the convent, she became <reg orig="ac-|quainted">acquainted</reg> <lb/>
with a young lady from Amiens, Sophia <reg orig="Can-|net">Cannet</reg>. <lb/>
They formed for each other a strong attachment <lb/>
and commenced a correspondence which continued for <lb/>
many years. There was a gentleman in Amiens by the <lb/>
name of Roland de la Plati&egrave;re, born of an opulent <lb/>
family, and holding the quite important office of <reg orig="inspec-|tor">inspector</reg> <lb/>
of manufactures. His time was mainly occupied <lb/>
in travelling and study. Being deeply interested in all <lb/>
subjects relating to political economy, he had devoted <lb/>
much attention to that science, and had written several <lb/>
treatises upon commerce, mechanics and agriculture <lb/>
<pb n="199" entity="b002082275_0224"/>
which had given him, in the literary and scientific world, <lb/>
no little celebrity. He frequently visited the father of <lb/>
Sophia. She often spoke to him of her friend Jane, <lb/>
showed him her portrait, and read to him extracts from <lb/>
her glowing letters. The calm philosopher became <lb/>
very much interested in the enthusiastic maiden, and <lb/>
entreated Sophia to give him a letter of introduction <lb/>
to her, upon one of his annual visits to Paris. Sophia <lb/>
had also often written to Jane of her father's friend, <lb/>
whom she regarded with so much reverence.</p>
<p>Jane, the enthusiastic, romantic Jane, saw in the <lb/>
serene philosopher one of the sages of antiquity, and <lb/>
almost literally bowed and worshipped. All the <reg orig="senti-|ments">sentiments</reg> <lb/>
of M. Roland were in accordance with the most <lb/>
cherished emotions which glowed in her mind. She found <lb/>
what she had ever been seeking, but had never found <lb/>
before, a truly sympathetic soul. She looked up to <lb/>
M. Roland as to a superior being&mdash;to an oracle,by <lb/>
whose decisions she could judge whether her own <reg orig="opin-|ions">opinions</reg> <lb/>
were right or wrong. It is true that M. Roland <lb/>
never entered those airy realms of beauty and regions of <lb/>
romance where Jane loved, at times, to revel. And <lb/>
perhaps Jane venerated him still more for his more <lb/>
stern and unimaginative philosophy. But his <reg orig="medita-|tive">meditative</reg> <lb/>
wisdom, his abstraction from the frivolous pursuits <lb/>
of life, his high ambition, his elevated pleasures, his <lb/>
consciousness of superiority over the mass of his <reg orig="fellow-|men">fellowmen</reg>, <lb/>
and his sleepless desire to be a benefactor of <reg orig="human-|ity">humanity</reg>, <lb/>
were all traits of character which resistlessly <reg orig="at-|tracted">attracted</reg> <lb/>
the admiration of Jane. She adored him as a <lb/>
disciple adores his master. She listened eagerly to all <lb/>
his words, and loved communion with his thoughts. <lb/>
M. Roland was by no means insensible to this homage <lb/>
<pb n="200" entity="b002082275_0225"/>
and he was charmed with her society because she was <lb/>
so delighted with his own conversation. Several years <lb/>
after their acquaintance began M. Roland made an <lb/>
avowal of his attachment. Jane knew very well the <lb/>
pride of the Roland family, and that her worldly <reg orig="cir-|cumstances">circumstances</reg> <lb/>
were such that the connection would not <lb/>
seem an advantageous one. She also was too proud <lb/>
to enter into a family who might feel dishonoured by <lb/>
the alliance. She, therefore, frankly told him that she <lb/>
felt much honoured by his addresses, and that she <lb/>
esteemed him more highly than any other man she had <lb/>
met. Her father was a ruined man, however, and by his <lb/>
increasing debts and his errors still deeper disgrace <lb/>
might be entailed upon all connected with him, and <lb/>
she could not think of allowing M. Roland to make his <lb/>
generosity to her a source of future mortification to <lb/>
himself.</p>
<p>The more she manifested this elevation of soul, in <lb/>
which Jane was perfectly sincere, the more earnestly <lb/>
did M. Roland persist in his plea. At last Jane, <reg orig="in-|fluenced">influenced</reg> <lb/>
by his entreaties, consented that he should <lb/>
make proposals to her father. He wrote to M. Phlippon. <lb/>
In reply he received an insulting letter, containing a <lb/>
blunt refusal. M. Phlippon declared that he had no <lb/>
idea of having for a son-in-law a man of such rigid <lb/>
principles, who would ever be reproaching him for all <lb/>
his little errors. He also told his daughter that she <lb/>
would find in a man of such austere virtue not a <reg orig="compan-|ion">companion</reg> <lb/>
and an equal, but a tyrant. Jane laid this refusal of <lb/>
her father deeply to heart, and resolved that if she <lb/>
could not marry the man of her choice, she would marry <lb/>
no one else. She wrote to M. Roland, requesting him to <lb/>
abandon his design, and not to expose himself to any <lb/>
<pb n="201" entity="b002082275_0226"/>
further affronts. She then requested permission of her <lb/>
father to retire to a convent.</p>
<p>The scanty income she had saved from her mother's <lb/>
property rendered it necessary for her to live with the <lb/>
utmost frugality. She determined to regulate her <reg orig="ex-|penses">expenses</reg> <lb/>
in accordance with this small sum. Potatoes, <lb/>
rice, and beans, with a little salt, and occasionally the <lb/>
luxury of a little butter, were her only food. She allowed <lb/>
herself to leave the convent but twice a week: once, <lb/>
to call for an hour upon a relative, and once to visit <lb/>
her father, and look after his linen. She had a little <lb/>
room under the roof in the attic, where the pattering of <lb/>
the rain upon the tiles soothed and lulled her to sleep <lb/>
by night. She carefully secluded herself from association <lb/>
with the other inmates of the convent, receiving only <lb/>
a visit of an hour each evening from the much-loved <lb/>
Sister Agatha. Her time she devoted, with unremitting <lb/>
diligence to those literary avocations in which she found <lb/>
so much delight.</p>
<p>The quiet and seclusion of this life had many charms <lb/>
for Jane. Indeed, a person with such resource for <lb/>
enjoyment within herself could never be very weary. <lb/>
Several months thus glided away in tranquillity. She <lb/>
occasionally walked in the garden, at hours when no <lb/>
one else was there. The resignation, which she had so <lb/>
long cultivated; the peaceful conscience she enjoyed, <lb/>
in view of duty performed; the elevation of spirit which <lb/>
enabled her to rise superior to misfortune; the <reg orig="method-|ical">methodical</reg> <lb/>
arrangement of time, which assigned to each hour <lb/>
its appropriate duty; the habit of close application. <lb/>
Which riveted her attention to her studies; the highly <lb/>
cultivated taste and buoyantly winged imagination, <lb/>
which opened before her all the fairy realms of fancy, <lb/>
<pb n="202" entity="b002082275_0227"/>
were treasures which gilded her cell and enriched her <lb/>
heart.</p>
<p>In the course of five or six months M. Roland again <lb/>
visited Paris, and called at the convent to see Jane. <lb/>
He saw her pale and pensive face behind a grating, and <lb/>
the sight of one who had suffered so much from her <lb/>
faithful love for him, and the sound of her voice, which <lb/>
ever possessed a peculiar charm, revived in his mind <lb/>
those impressions which had been somewhat fading <lb/>
away. He again renewed his offer and entreated her <lb/>
to allow the marriage ceremony at once to be performed. <lb/>
Jane, without much delay, yielded to his appeals. They <lb/>
were married in the winter of 1780. Jane was then <lb/>
twenty-five years of age. Her husband was twenty <lb/>
years her senior.</p>
<p>The first year of their marriage life they passed in <lb/>
Paris. It was to Madame Roland a year of great <reg orig="en-|joyment">enjoyment</reg>. <lb/>
Her husband was publishing a work upon <lb/>
the arts, and she, with all the energy of her enthusiastic <lb/>
mind, entered into all his literary enterprises. With <lb/>
great care and accuracy she prepared his manuscripts <lb/>
for the press and corrected the proofs. She lived in <lb/>
the study with him, became the companion of all his <lb/>
thoughts, and his assistant in all labours. The only <lb/>
recreations in which she indulged, during the winter, <lb/>
were to attend a course of lectures upon natural history <lb/>
and botany. M. Roland had hired ready furnished <lb/>
lodgings. She, well instructed by her mother in <reg orig="do-|mestic">domestic</reg> <lb/>
duties, observing that all kinds of cooking did <lb/>
not agree with him, took pleasure in preparing his food <lb/>
with her own hands. Her husband engrossed her <lb/>
whole time, and, being naturally rather austere and <lb/>
imperious, he secluded her from the society of others <lb/>
<pb n="203" entity="b002082275_0228"/>
and monopolised all her capabilities of friendly <lb/>
feeling.</p>
<p>At the close of the year the couple went to Amiens <lb/>
and soon after was born a daughter, her only child, <lb/>
whom she nurtured with the most assiduous care. Her <lb/>
literary labours were, however, unremitted, and she <lb/>
still lived in the study with her books and her pen. M. <lb/>
Roland was writing several articles for an encyclop&aelig;dia. <lb/>
She aided most efficiently in collecting the materials <lb/>
and arranging the matter. Indeed, she wielded a far <lb/>
more vigorous pen than he did. Her copiousness of <lb/>
language, her facility of expression and the play of her <lb/>
fancy, gave her the command of a very fascinating style; <lb/>
and M. Roland obtained the credit for many passages <lb/>
rich in diction and beautiful in imagery for which he <lb/>
was indebted to the glowing imagination of his wife. <lb/>
Frequent sickness of her husband alarmed her for his <lb/>
life. The tenderness with which she watched over him <lb/>
strengthened the tie which united them. He could not <lb/>
but love a young and beautiful wife so devoted to him. <lb/>
She could not but love one upon whom she was <reg orig="con-|ferring">conferring</reg> <lb/>
such rich blessings. Their little daughter, <lb/>
Eudora, was a source of great delight to the fond parents, <lb/>
and Madame Roland took the deepest interest in the <reg orig="de-|velopments">developments</reg> <lb/>
of her mind. The office of M. Roland was <lb/>
highly lucrative, and his literary projects successful. <lb/>
They remained in Amiens four years.</p>
<p>Later they retired to La Plati&egrave;re, the paternal estate <lb/>
of M. Roland, situated at the base of the mountains near <lb/>
Lyons in the valley of the Sa&ocirc;ne. It is a region solitary <lb/>
and wild, with rivulets meandering down from the <lb/>
mountains, fringed with willows and poplars, and <lb/>
threading their way through narrow, yet smooth and <lb/>
<pb n="204" entity="b002082275_0229"/>
fertile meadows luxuriant with vineyards. A large, <lb/>
square stone house, with regular windows and a roof <lb/>
nearly flat, of red tiles constituted the comfortable, <lb/>
spacious and substantial mansion.</p>
<p>Her mode of life during the five calm and sunny years <lb/>
at La Plati&egrave;re must have been exceedingly attractive. <lb/>
She rose with the sun, devoted sundry attentions to her <lb/>
husband and child, and personally superintended the <lb/>
arrangements for breakfast, taking an affectionate <reg orig="pleas-|ure">pleasure</reg> <lb/>
in preparing her husband's frugal food with her <lb/>
own hands. That social meal being passed, M. Roland <lb/>
entered the library for his intellectual toil, taking with <lb/>
him for his silent companion the idolised little Eudora. <lb/>
She amused herself with her pencil or reading or other <lb/>
studies, which her father and mother superintended. <lb/>
Madame Roaland, in the meantime devoted herself, with <lb/>
most systematic energy, to her domestic concerns. She <lb/>
was a perfect housekeeper and each morning all the <lb/>
interests of her family, from the cellar to the garret, <lb/>
passed under her eye. She superintended the <reg orig="preser-|vation">preservation</reg> <lb/>
of the fruit, the sorting of the linen, and those <lb/>
other details of domestic life which engross the <reg orig="atten-|tion">attention</reg> <lb/>
of a good housewife. The systematic division of <lb/>
time, which seemed to be an instinctive principle of her <lb/>
nature, enabled her to accomplish all this in two hours. <lb/>
She had faithful and devoted servants to do the work. <lb/>
The superintendence was all that was required. This <lb/>
genius to superintend and be the head, while others <lb/>
contribute the hands, is not the most common of human <lb/>
endowments. Madame Roland, having thus attended <lb/>
to her domestic concerns, laid aside those cares for the <lb/>
remainder of the day, and entered the study to join her <lb/>
husband in his labours there.</p>
<pb n="205" entity="b002082275_0230"/>
<p>At the close of the literary labours of the morning <lb/>
Madame Roland met her guests at the dinner table. <lb/>
The labour of the day was then over. The repast was <lb/>
prolonged with social converse. After dinner they <lb/>
walked in the garden, sauntered through the vineyard <lb/>
and looked at the innumerable objects of interest which <lb/>
are ever to be found in the yard of a spacious farm. <lb/>
Madame Roland frequently retired to the library to write <lb/>
letters to her friends or to superintend the lessons of <lb/>
Eudora. Occasionally, of a fine day, she would walk <lb/>
for several miles, calling at the cottages of the peasantry, <lb/>
whom she greatly endeared to her by her unvarying <lb/>
kindness. In the evening, after tea, they agian <lb/>
resorted to the library. Guests of distinguished name <lb/>
and influence were frequently with them, and the hours <lb/>
glided swiftly, cheered by the brilliance of philosophy <lb/>
and genius. The journals of the day were read, <reg orig="Ma-|dame">Madame</reg> <lb/>
Roland being usually called upon as reader. When <lb/>
not thus reading, she usually sat at her work-table, <lb/>
employing her fingers with her needle, while she took <lb/>
part in the conversation.</p>
<p>"This kind of life," says Madame Roland, "would <lb/>
be very austere, were not my husband a man of great <lb/>
merit, whom I love with my whole heart. I <reg orig="congrat-|ulate">congratulate</reg> <lb/>
myself on enjoying it; and I exert my best <reg orig="endeav-|ours">endeavours</reg> <lb/>
to make it last."</p>
<p>Again she draws the captivating picture of rural <lb/>
pleasures:</p>
<p>"I am preserving pears which will be delicious. We <lb/>
are drying raisins and prunes. We overlook the <reg orig="ser-|vants">servants</reg> <lb/>
busy in the vineyard; respose in the shady groves, <lb/>
and on the green meadows; gather walnuts from the <lb/>
trees; and having collected our stock of fruit for the <lb/>
<pb n="206" entity="b002082275_0231"/>
winter, spread it to dry. After breakfast this morning <lb/>
we are all going in a body to gather almonds. Throw <lb/>
off, then, dear friend, your fetters for a while, and come <lb/>
and join us in our retreat. You will find here true <reg orig="friend-|ship">friendship</reg> <lb/>
and real simplicity of heart."</p>
<p>Madame Roland was thus living at La Plati&egrave;re, in <lb/>
the enjoyment of all that this world can give of peace <lb/>
and happiness, when the first portentious mutterings <lb/>
of the French Revolution fell upon her ears. She eagerly <lb/>
caught the sounds, and, believing them the precursor <lb/>
of blessings, rejoiced in the assurance that the hour was <lb/>
approaching when long-oppressed humanity would <reg orig="reas-|sert">reassert</reg> <lb/>
its rights and achieve its triumph. Little did she <lb/>
dream of the woes which in surging billows were to roll <lb/>
over her country and which were to engulf her and all <lb/>
whom she loved in their tide. Her faith in human <lb/>
nature was so strong that she could foresee no obstacles <lb/>
and no dangers in the way of immediate <reg orig="disfranchise-|ment">disfranchisement</reg> <lb/>
from all laws and usages which her judgment <reg orig="dis-|approved">disapproved</reg>. <lb/>
Her whole soul was aroused and she devoted <lb/>
all her affections and every energy of her mind to the <lb/>
welfare of the human race.</p>
<p>Louis XVI. and Maria Antoinette had but recently <lb/>
inherited the throne of the Bourbons. Louis was <reg orig="benev-|olent">benevolent</reg>, <lb/>
but destitute of the decision of character requisite <lb/>
to hold the reins of government in a stormy period <lb/>
Maria Antoinette had neither culture of mind <unclear id="u13">not</unclear> <lb/>
knowledge of the world. She was an amiable but <lb/>
spoiled child, with native nobleness of character, but <lb/>
with those defects which are the natural consequence <lb/>
of the frivolous education she had received. She thought <lb/>
never of duty and responsibility; always and only <unclear id="u14">of</unclear> <lb/>
<pb n="207" entity="b002082275_0232"/>
pleasure. It was her misfortune rather than her fault <lb/>
that the idea never entered her mind that kings and <lb/>
queens had aught else to do than to indulge in luxury. <lb/>
It would be hardly possible to conceive of two <reg orig="charac-|ters">characters</reg> <lb/>
less qualified to occupy the throne in stormy times <lb/>
than were Louis and Maria. The people were slowly, <lb/>
but with resistless power, rising against the abuses of <lb/>
the aristocracy and the monarchy. Louis, a man of <lb/>
unblemished kindness, was made the scapegoat for the <lb/>
sins of oppressive, profligate princes, who for centuries <lb/>
had trodden with iron hoofs upon the necks of their <lb/>
subjects. The accumulated hate of ages was poured <lb/>
upon his head.</p>
<p>The National Assembly consisted of the nobility, the <lb/>
higher clergy, and representatives, chosen by the people, <lb/>
from all parts of France.</p>
<p>M. Roland, who was quite an idol with the populace <lb/>
of Lyons and its vicinity, was chosen representative to <lb/>
the Assembly from the city of Lyons. In that busy <lb/>
city the revolutionary movement had begun with great <lb/>
power, and the name of Roland was the rallying point <lb/>
of the people now struggling to escape from oppression. <lb/>
M. Roland spent some time in the city, drawn thither by <lb/>
the intense interest of the times, and in the salon of <lb/>
Madame Roland meetings were every evening held by <lb/>
the most influential men of the revolutionary party. <lb/>
Her ardour stimulated their zeal, and her well-stored <lb/>
mind and fascinating eloquence guided their councils.</p>
<p>In this rising conflict between plebeian and patrician, <lb/>
between democrat and aristocrat, the position in which <lb/>
M. Roland and wife were placed, as most conspicuous and <lb/>
influential members of the revolutionary party, arrayed <lb/>
against them, with daily increasing animosity, the <reg orig="aristo-|cratic">aristocratic</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="208" entity="b002082275_0233"/>
community of Lyons. Each day their names <lb/>
were pronounced by the advocates of reform with more <lb/>
enthusiasm and by their opponents with deepening <lb/>
hostility. The applause and the censure alike <reg orig="invigor-|ated">invigorated</reg> <lb/>
Madame Roland, and her whole soul became <reg orig="ab-|sorbed">absorbed</reg> <lb/>
in the idea of popular liberty. This object <lb/>
became her passion, and she devoted herself to it with <lb/>
the concentration of every energy of mind and heart.</p>
<p>On the 20th of February, 1791, Madame Roland <lb/>
accompanied her husband to Paris, as he took his seat <lb/>
in the National Assembly. Her persuasive influence was <lb/>
dictating those measures which were driving the ancient <lb/>
nobility of France from their ch&acirc;teaux, and her vigorous <lb/>
mind was guiding those blows before which the throne <lb/>
of the Bourbons trembled. The unblemished and <reg orig="incor-|ruptible">incorruptible</reg> <lb/>
integrity of M. Roland, his simplicity of manners <lb/>
and ability, invested him immediately with much <reg orig="author-|ity">authority</reg> <lb/>
among his associates. The brilliance of his wife <lb/>
also reflected much lustre upon his name. Madame <lb/>
Roland with her growing zeal, had just written a <reg orig="pam-|phlet">pamphlet</reg> <lb/>
upon the new order of things, in language so <reg orig="pow-|erful">powerful</reg> <lb/>
and impressive that more than sixty thousand <lb/>
copies had been sold&mdash;an enormous number, considering <lb/>
the comparative fewness of readers at that time. She, <lb/>
of course, was received with the most flattering <reg orig="atten-|tion">attention</reg>, <lb/>
and great deference was paid to her opinions. She <lb/>
attended daily the sittings of the Assembly, and listened <lb/>
with the deepest interest to the debates.</p>
<p>All her tastes were with the ancient nobility and their <lb/>
defenders. All her principles were with the people. <lb/>
And as she contrasted the unrefined exterior and clumsy <lb/>
speech of the democratic leaders with the courtly <reg orig="bear-|ing">bearing</reg> <lb/>
and elegant diction of those who rallied around the <lb/>
<pb n="209" entity="b002082275_0234"/>
throne, she was aroused to a more vehement desire for <lb/>
the elevation of those with whom she had cast in her lot. <lb/>
The conflict with the nobles was of short continuance. <lb/>
The energy of rising democracy soon vanquished them.</p>
<p>The most moderate party was called the Girondist. <lb/>
It was so called because their most prominent leaders <lb/>
were from the department of the Gironde. They <lb/>
would deprive the King of many of his prerogatives, but <lb/>
not of his crown. They would take from him his <reg orig="des-|potic">despotic</reg> <lb/>
power, but not his life. They would raise the mass <lb/>
of the people to the enjoyment of liberty, but to liberty <lb/>
controlled by vigorous law. Opposed to them were <lb/>
the Jacobins &mdash; far more radical in their reform. They <lb/>
would break down all privileged orders, confiscate the <lb/>
property of the nobles and place prince and beggar on <lb/>
the footing of equality. These were the two great <reg orig="par-|ties">parties</reg> <lb/>
into which revolutionary France was divided and <lb/>
the conflict between them was the most fierce and <reg orig="im-|placable">implacable</reg> <lb/>
earty has ever witnessed.</p>
<p>M. Roland and wife gathered around them every <lb/>
evening many of the most influential members of the <lb/>
Assembly. They attached themselves with all their <lb/>
zeal and energy to the Girondists. Four evenings of <lb/>
every week the leaders of this party met in the salon <lb/>
of Madame Roland. to deliberate respecting their <lb/>
measures.</p>
<p>The powerful influence which Madame Roland was <lb/>
thus exerting could not be concealed. She appeared <lb/>
to have no ambition for personal renown. She sought <lb/>
only to elevate the position and expand the celebrity <lb/>
of her husband. It was whispered from ear to ear, and <lb/>
now and then openly asserted in the Assembly, that the <lb/>
bold and decisive measures of the Girondists received <lb/>
<pb n="210" entity="b002082275_0235"/>
their impulse from the lovely wife of M. Roland. She <lb/>
also furnished many very able articles for a widely <lb/>
circulated journal, established by the Girondists for the <lb/>
advocacy of their political views.</p>
<p>The spirit of the revolution was advancing with giant <lb/>
strides, and the throne was reeling beneath the blows <lb/>
of the people. Massacres were rife all over the <reg orig="king-|dom">kingdom</reg>. <lb/>
The sky was nightly illumined by conflagrations. <lb/>
Nobles were abandoning their estates and escaping from <lb/>
perils and death to refuge in the little army of emigrants <lb/>
at Coblentz. The King, insulted and a prisoner, reigned <lb/>
but in name. He hoped, by the appointment of a <lb/>
Republican ministry to pacify the democratic spirit.</p>
<p>He yielded to the pressure, dismissed his ministers <lb/>
and surrendered himself to the Girondists for the <reg orig="ap-|pointment">appointment</reg> <lb/>
of a new ministry. The Girondists called <lb/>
upon M. Roland to take the important post of Minister <lb/>
of the Interior. It was a perilous position to fill, but <lb/>
what danger will not ambition face? In the present <lb/>
posture of affairs the Minister of the Interior was the <lb/>
monarch of France. M. Roland smiled nervously at <lb/>
the power which, thus unsolicited, was passing into <lb/>
his hands. Madame Roland, whom all-absorbing <reg orig="pas-|sion">passion</reg> <lb/>
it now was to elevate her husband to the highest <lb/>
summits of greatness, was gratified in view of the <reg orig="hon-|our">honour</reg> <lb/>
and agitated in view of the peril; but, to her exalted <lb/>
spirit, the greater the danger, the more heroic the act.</p>
<p>"The burden is heavy," she said; "but Roland has a <lb/>
great consciousness of his own powers, and would derive <lb/>
fresh strength from the feeling of being useful to liberty <lb/>
and his country."</p>
<p>In March, 1792, he entered upon his arduous and <lb/>
exalted office. When M. Roland made his first <reg orig="appear-|ance">appearance</reg><lb/>
<pb n="211" entity="b002082275_0236"/>
at court instead of arraying himself in the court <lb/>
dress, he affected in his costume the simplicity of his <lb/>
principles. He had not forgotten the impression <reg orig="pro-|duced">produced</reg> <lb/>
in France by Franklin, as in republican simplicity <lb/>
he moved among the glittering throng at Versailles. He <lb/>
accordingly presented himself at the Tuileries in a plain <lb/>
black coat, with a round hat, and dusty shoes fastened <lb/>
with ribbons instead of buckles. The courtiers were <lb/>
indignant. The king was highly displeased at what he <lb/>
considered an act of disrespect. The master of <reg orig="cere-|monies">ceremonies</reg> <lb/>
was in consternation, and exclaimed with a look <lb/>
of horror to General Damuriez: <lb/>
<q>"My dear sir, he has not even buckles on his shoes!"</q>
<q>"Mercy upon us!" exclaimed the old general, with the <lb/>
most laughable expression of affected gravity. "we shall <lb/>
then all go to ruin together!"</q>
<q>M. Roland after his first interview with the monarch <reg orig="as-|sured">assured</reg> <lb/>
his wife that the community had formed a totally <reg orig="er-|roneous">erroneous</reg> <lb/>
estimate of the King; that he was a hearty <reg orig="sup-|porter">supporter</reg> <lb/>
of the Constitution which had been forced upon him. <lb/>
The prompt reply of Madame Roland displayed even more <lb/>
than her characteristic sagacity:</q>
<q>"If Louis is sincerely a friend of the Constitution, he <lb/>
must be virtuous beyond the common race of mortals. <reg orig="Mis-|trust">Mistrust</reg> <lb/>
your own virtue, M. Roland. You are only an honest <lb/>
countryman wandering amid a crowd of courtiers. They <lb/>
speak our language; we do not know theirs. No! Louis <lb/>
cannot love the chains that fetter him. He may feign to <lb/>
caress them. He thinks only of how he can spurn them. <lb/>
No man likes his humiliation. Trust in human nature, <lb/>
that never deceives. Distrust courts. Your virtue is too <lb/>
elevated to see the snares which courtiers spread beneath <lb/>
your feet."</q></p>
<pb n="212" entity="b002082275_0237"/>
<p>From all the spacious apartments of the mansion <lb/>
alloted as the residence of the Minister of the Interior <lb/>
Madame Roland selected a small and retired parlour, <lb/>
which she had furnished with every attraction as a <lb/>
library and a study. This was her much-loved retreat, <lb/>
and here M. Roland, in the presence of his wife, was <lb/>
accustomed to see his friends in all their confidential <lb/>
intercourse. But the position of the Girondists began <lb/>
to be more and more perilous. The army of emigrant <lb/>
nobles at Coblentz, within the dominions of the King <lb/>
of Prussia, was rapidly increasing in numbers. There <lb/>
were hundreds of thousands in France, the most <reg orig="illus-|trious">illustrious</reg> <lb/>
in rank and opulence, who would join such an <lb/>
army. The people all believed that Louis wished to <lb/>
escape from Paris and head that army. On the other <lb/>
hand, they saw another party, the Jacobin, noisy, <reg orig="turbu-|lent">turbulent</reg>, <lb/>
sanguinary and threatening with destruction all <lb/>
connected in any way with the execrated throne. M. <lb/>
Roland was urged to present to the throne a most <reg orig="earn-|est">earnest</reg> <lb/>
letter of expostulation and advice. Madame Roland <lb/>
sat down at her desk and wrote the letter for her husband. <lb/>
It was expressed in that glowing style so eminently at <lb/>
her command. Its eloquence was inspired by the <reg orig="fore-|sight">foresight</reg> <lb/>
she had of impending perils. M. Roland, almost <lb/>
trembling in view of its boldness and its truths, presented <lb/>
the letter to the King. Its last sentences will give some <lb/>
idea of its character: <lb/>
<q>Love, serve the Revolution, and the people with love it and <lb/>
serve it in you. Ratify the measures to extirpate their <reg orig="fanati-|cism">fanaticism</reg>. <lb/>
Paris trembles in view of its danger. Surround its walls <lb/>
with an army of defence. Delay longer, and you will be deemed <lb/>
a conspirator and an accomplice. Just Heaven! hast thou <lb/>
stricken kings with blindness? I know that truth is rarely <reg orig="wel-|comed">welcomed</reg> <lb/>
at the foot of thrones. I know, too, that the withholding <lb/>
<pb n="213" entity="b002082275_0238"/>
of truth from kings renders revolutions so often necessary. As <lb/>
a citizen, a minister, I owe truth to the King, and nothing shall <lb/>
prevent me from making it reach his ear.</q></p>
<p>This celebrated letter was presented to the King on <lb/>
the 11th of June, 1792. On the same day M. Roland <lb/>
received a letter from the King informing him that he <lb/>
was dismissed from office.</p>
<p>"Here am I, dismissed from office," was M. Roland's <lb/>
exclamation to his wife on his return home.</p>
<p>"Present your letter to the Assembly, that the nation <lb/>
may see for what counsel you have been dismissed," <lb/>
replied the undaunted wife.</p>
<p>M. Roland did so. He was received as a martyr to <lb/>
patriotism. The letter was read amid the loudest <lb/>
applause. It was ordered to be printed and circulated <lb/>
by tens of thousands through the kingdom; and there <lb/>
came rolling back upon the metropolis the echo of the <lb/>
most tumultuous indignation and applause. The <reg orig="fam-|ous">famous</reg> <lb/>
letter was read by all France&mdash;nay, more, by all <lb/>
Europe. Roland was a hero. Upon this wave of <reg orig="en-|thusiastic">enthusiastic</reg> <lb/>
popularity Madame Roland and her husband <lb/>
retired from the magnificent palace where they had <lb/>
dwelt for so short a time and selected for their retreat <lb/>
very humble apartments in an apparently obscure street.</p>
<p>But M. Roland and wife were more powerful now <lb/>
than ever before. The letter had placed them in the front <lb/>
ranks of the friends of reform, and enshrined them in <lb/>
the hearts of the ever fickle populace. Even the <lb/>
Jacobins were compelled to swell the universal voice <lb/>
of commendation. M. Roland's apartments were ever <lb/>
thronged. All important plans were discussed and <lb/>
shaped by him and his wife before they were presented <lb/>
to the Assembly.</p>
<pb n="214" entity="b002082275_0239"/>
<p>The outcry against M. Roland's dismissal was falling <lb/>
in thunder tones on the ear of the King. This act <lb/>
had fanned those flames of revolutionary frenzy which <lb/>
were now glaring in every part of France. The people, <lb/>
intoxicated and maddened by the discovery of their <lb/>
power, were now arrayed, with irresistible thirstings <lb/>
for destruction and blood, against the King, the court, <lb/>
and the nobility. There was no hope for Louis but in <lb/>
the recall of M. Roland. The Jacobins were upon him <lb/>
in locust legions. M. Roland alone could bring the <lb/>
Girondists, as a shield, between the throne and the <lb/>
mob. He was recalled, and again moved in calm <lb/>
triumph from his obscure chambers to the palace of <lb/>
the minister. If Madame Roland's letter dismissed <lb/>
him from office, her letter also restored him again with <lb/>
an enormous accumulation of power.</p>
<p>Madame Roland was far more conscious of the <lb/>
peril than her husband. With intense emotion, but <lb/>
calmly and firmly, she looked upon the gathering <lb/>
storm. The peculiarity of her character, and her <lb/>
great moral courage, was illustrated by the mode of <lb/>
life she vigorously adopted. She was entirely <reg orig="undaz-|zled">undazzled</reg>, <lb/>
and resolved that, consecrating all her energies to <lb/>
the demands of the tempestuous times, she would <lb/>
waste no time in fashionable parties and heartless <lb/>
visits. Selecting for her own use one of the <reg orig="small-|est">smallest</reg> <lb/>
parlous, she furnished it as her library. <lb/>
Here she lived engrossed in study, busy with <lb/>
her pen, and taking and unseen but most active <lb/>
part in all those measures which were literally agitating <lb/>
the whole civilised world. Her little library was the <lb/>
sanctuary for all confidential conversation upon <reg orig="mat-|ters">matters</reg> <lb/>
of state. Here her husband met his political friends <lb/>
<pb n="215" entity="b002082275_0240"/>
to mature their measures. She wrote many of his <lb/>
proclamations, his letters, his state papers, and with all <lb/>
the glowing fervour of an enthusiastic woman.</p>
<p>She writes: <lb/>
<q>Without me my husband would have been quite as good a <lb/>
minister, for his knowledge, his activity, his integrity were all his <lb/>
own; but with me he attracted more attention, because I infused <lb/>
into his writings that mixture of spirit and gentleness, of <reg orig="authori-|tative">authoritative</reg> <lb/>
reason and seducing sentiment, which is, perhaps, only to <lb/>
be found in the language of a woman who has a clear head and <lb/>
a feeling heart.</q></p>
<p>Anarchy now reigned throughout France. The King <lb/>
and the royal family were imprisoned in the Temple. <lb/>
The Girondists in the National Convention, and M. <lb/>
Roland at the head of the ministry, were struggling to <lb/>
restore the dominion of law, and, if possible, to save <lb/>
the life of the King. The Jacobins, who, unable to <lb/>
resist the popularity of M. Roland, had, for a time, <lb/>
co&ouml;perated with the Girondists, now began to separate <lb/>
themselves again more widely from them. They <reg orig="flat-|tered">flattered</reg> <lb/>
the mob. They encouraged every possible <reg orig="demon-|stration">demonstration</reg> <lb/>
of lawless violence. In tones daily increasing <lb/>
in boldness and efficiency, they declared the Girondists <lb/>
to be the friends of the monarch, and the enemies of <reg orig="popu-|lar">popular</reg> <lb/>
liberty.</p>
<p>Madame Roland, in the name of her husband, drew <lb/>
up for the Convention the plan of a republic as a <reg orig="substi-|tute">substitute</reg> <lb/>
for the throne. From childhood she had yearned <lb/>
for a republic. Now the throne and hereditary rank <lb/>
were virtually abolished, and all France clamoured <lb/>
for a republic. Her husband was nominally Minister <lb/>
of the Interior, but his power was gone. The mob of <lb/>
Paris had usurped the place of King, and Constitution <lb/>
<pb n="216" entity="b002082275_0241"/>
and law. The Jacobins were attaining the decided <lb/>
ascendency. The guillotine was daily crimsoned with <lb/>
the blood of the noblest citizens of France. The streets <lb/>
and the prisons were polluted with the massacre of the <lb/>
innocent.</p>
<p>M. Roland was almost frantic in view of these horrors <lb/>
which he had no power to quell. The mob, headed <lb/>
by the Jacobins, had now the complete ascendency, and <lb/>
he was minister but in name. He urged the adoption <lb/>
of immediate and energetic measures to arrest these <lb/>
execrable deeds of lawless violence. Many of the <reg orig="Giron-|dists">Girondists</reg> <lb/>
in the Assembly gave vehement utterance to their <lb/>
execration of the massacres. Others were intimidated <lb/>
by the weapons which the Jacobins were now so <reg orig="effec-|tually">effectually</reg> <lb/>
wielding. Madame Roland distinctly saw and <lb/>
deeply felt the peril to which she and her friends were <lb/>
exposed. She knew, and they all knew, that defeat <lb/>
was death.</p>
<p>The question between the Girondist and the Jacobin <lb/>
was: "Who shall lie down on the guillotine?" For <lb/>
some time the issue of the struggle was uncertain. <lb/>
The Jacobins summoned their allies, the mob. They <lb/>
surrounded the doors and the windows of the Assembly, <lb/>
and with their howlings sustained their friends. The <lb/>
Girondists found themselves, at the close of the struggle, <lb/>
defeated, yet so decidedly but that they still clung to <lb/>
hope.</p>
<p>M. Roland, who had not yet entirely lost, with the <reg orig="peo-|ple">people</reg>, <lb/>
that popularity which swept him again into the <lb/>
office of Minister of the Interior, now presented to the <lb/>
Assembly his resignation of power which was merely <lb/>
nominal. Great efforts had for some time been made <lb/>
by his adversaries, to turn the tide of popular hatred <lb/>
<pb n="217" entity="b002082275_0242"/>
against him, and especially against his wife. Madame <lb/>
Roland might have fled from these perils, and have <lb/>
retired with her husband to tranquillity and safety, but <lb/>
she urged M. Roland to remain at his post and resolved <lb/>
to remain herself and meet her destiny, whatever it might <lb/>
be.</p>
<p>The Jacobins now made a direct and infamous <lb/>
attempt to turn the rage of the populace against Madame <lb/>
Roland. She was summoned to present herself before <lb/>
the Convention, to confront her accuser, and defend <lb/>
herself from the scaffold. Her gentle yet imperial spirit <lb/>
was undaunted by the magnitude of the peril. Her <lb/>
name had often been mentioned in the Assembly as the <lb/>
inspiring genius of the most influential party which <lb/>
had risen up amid the storms of the Revolution. Her <lb/>
talents, her accomplishments, her fascinating eloquence, <lb/>
had spread her renown widely through Europe.</p>
<p>The aspect of a woman combining in her person and <lb/>
mind all the attractions of nature and genius, entering <lb/>
this vast assembly of irritated men to speak in defence <lb/>
of her life, at once hushed the clamour of hoarse voices <lb/>
and subdued the rage of angry disputants. Silence filled <lb/>
the hall. Every eye was fixed upon her. She stood <lb/>
before the bar.</p>
<p>"What is your name?" inquired the president.</p>
<p>She paused for a moment, and then in clear and liquid <lb/>
tones answered:</p>
<p>"Roland! A name of which I am proud, for it is that <lb/>
of a good and an honourable man."</p>
<p>"Do you know Achille Viard?" the president inquired.</p>
<p>"I have once, and but once, seen him."</p>
<p>"What has passed between you?"</p>
<p>"Twice he has written to me, soliciting and interview. <lb/>
<pb n="218" entity="b002082275_0243"/>
Once I saw him. After a short conversation, I perceived <lb/>
that he was a spy, and dismissed him with the contempt <lb/>
he deserved."</p>
<p>Briefly, in tremulous tones of voice, but with a spirit <lb/>
of firmness which no terrors could daunt, she entered <lb/>
upon her defence. It was the first time that a woman's <lb/>
voice had been heard in the midst of the clamour of these <lb/>
enraged combatants. The Assembly, unused to such a <lb/>
scene, were fascinated by her attractive eloquence. <lb/>
Madame Roland was acquitted by acclamation. Upon <lb/>
the spot the president proposed that the marked respect <lb/>
of the Convention be conferred upon Madame Roland. <lb/>
With enthusiasm the resolution was carried. As she <lb/>
retired from the hall, her bosom glowing with the <reg orig="excite-|ment">excitement</reg> <lb/>
of the triumph she had won, her ear was greeted <lb/>
with the enthusiastic applause of the whole Assembly. <lb/>
The eyes of all France had been attracted to her as she <lb/>
thus defended herself and her friends, and confounded <lb/>
her enemies.</p>
<p>The most distressing embarrassments now surrounded <lb/>
M. Roland. He could not abandon power without <lb/>
abandoning himself and his supporters in the Assembly <lb/>
to the guillotine; and while continuing in power, he was <lb/>
compelled to witness deeds of atrocity from which not <lb/>
only his soul revolted, but to which it was necessary <lb/>
for him apparently to give his sanction. Thus situated, <lb/>
he sent in his final resignation and retired to humble <lb/>
lodgings in one of the obscure streets of Paris. Here, <lb/>
anxiously watching the progress of events, he began to <lb/>
make preparations to leave the mob-enthralled metropolis <lb/>
and seek a retreat in the calm seclusion of La Plati&egrave;re. <lb/>
Neither the sacredness of law nor the weapons of their <lb/>
friends could longer afford them any protection. The <lb/>
<pb n="219" entity="b002082275_0244"/>
danger became so imminent that the friends of Madame <lb/>
Roland brought her the dress of a peasant girl, and <reg orig="en-|treated">entreated</reg> <lb/>
her to put it on, as a disguise and escape by night, <lb/>
that her husband might follow after her, unencumbered <lb/>
by his family; but she proudly repelled that which she <lb/>
deemed a cowardly artifice. She threw the dress aside, <lb/>
exclaiming:</p>
<p>"I am ashamed to resort to any such expedient. I <lb/>
will neither disguise myself, nor make any attempt at <lb/>
secret escape. My enemies may find me always in my <lb/>
place. If I am assassinated it shall be in my own home. <lb/>
I owe my country an example of firmness, and I will <lb/>
give it."</p>
<p>The gray of a dull and sombre morning was just <reg orig="begin-|ning">beginning</reg> <lb/>
to appear as Madame Roland threw herself upon <lb/>
a bed for a few moments of repose. Overwhelmed by <lb/>
sorrow and fatigue, she had just fallen asleep, when a <lb/>
band of armed men rudely broke into her house, and <lb/>
demanded to be conducted to her apartment. She <lb/>
knew too well the object of the summons. The order <lb/>
for her arrest was presented her. she calmly read it, <lb/>
and requested permission to write to a friend. The <lb/>
request was granted. When the note was finished, the <lb/>
officer informed her that it would be necessary for him <lb/>
to be made acquainted with its contents. She quietly <lb/>
tore it into fragments and cast it into the fire. Then, <lb/>
imprinting her last kiss upon the cheek of her <reg orig="uncon-|scious">unconscious</reg> <lb/>
child, with the composure which such a <reg orig="cata-|strophe">catastrophe</reg> <lb/>
would naturally produce in so heroic a mind, she <lb/>
left her home for the prison. As she was led from the <lb/>
house a vast crowd collected around the door, who, <lb/>
believing her to be a traitor to her country, and in league <lb/>
with her enemies, shouted, "A la guillotine!" Unmoved <lb/>
<pb n="220" entity="b002082275_0245"/>
by their cries, she looked calmly without gesture or <lb/>
reply. One of the officers, to relieve her from the insults <lb/>
to which she was exposed, asked her if she wished to have <lb/>
the windows of the carriage closed.</p>
<p>"No!" she replied, "I do not fear the looks of honest <lb/>
men, and I brave those of my enemies."</p>
<p>"You have very great resolution," was the reply, <lb/>
"thus calmly to await justice."</p>
<p>"Justice!" she exclaimed; "were justice done I should <lb/>
not be here. But I shall go to the scaffold as fearlessly <lb/>
as I now proceed to the prison."</p>
<p>At ten o'clock that evening, her cell being prepared, <lb/>
she entered it for the first time. It was a cold, bare <lb/>
room, with walls blackened by the dust and damp of <lb/>
ages. There was a small fireplace in the room, and a <lb/>
narrow window, with a double iron grating, which <lb/>
admitted but a dim twilight even at noonday. In one <lb/>
corner there was a pallet of straw. The chill night air <lb/>
crept in at the unglazed window, and the dismal tocsin <lb/>
proclaimed that Paris was still the scene of tumult and <lb/>
of violence. Madame Roland threw herself upon her <lb/>
humble bed, and was so overpowered by fatigue and <lb/>
exhaustion that she woke not from her dreamless slumber <lb/>
until twelve o'clock of the next day.</p>
<p>Eudora, who had been left by her mother in the care <lb/>
of weeping domestics, was taken by a friend and watched <lb/>
over and protected with maternal care. Though Madame <lb/>
Roland never saw her idolised child again, her heart <lb/>
was comforted in the prison by the assurance that she <lb/>
had found a home with those who, for her mother's sake, <lb/>
would love and cherish her.</p>
<p>When Madame Roland awoke from her long sleep, <lb/>
instead of yielding to despair and surrendering herself <lb/>
<pb n="221" entity="b002082275_0246"/>
to useless repinings, she immediately began to arrange <lb/>
her cell as comfortably as possible, and to look round <lb/>
for such sources of comfort and enjoyment as might yet <lb/>
be obtained. She obtained the favour of a small table, <lb/>
and then of a neat white spread to cover it. This she <lb/>
placed near the window to serve for her writing-desk. <lb/>
To keep this table, which she prized so highly, unsoiled, <lb/>
she smilingly told her keeper that she should make a <lb/>
dining-table of her stove. A rusty dining-table indeed <lb/>
it was. Two hairpins, which she drew from her own <lb/>
clustering ringlets, she drove into a shelf for pegs to hang <lb/>
her clothes upon. These arrangements she made as <lb/>
cheerfully as when superintending the disposition of <lb/>
the gorgeous furniture in the palace over which she had <lb/>
presided. Having thus provided her study, her next care <lb/>
was to obtain a few books. She happened to have <reg orig="Thom-|son's">Thomson's</reg> <lb/>
"Seasons," a favourite volume of hers, in her pocket. <lb/>
Through the jailer's wife she succeeded in obtaining <lb/>
"Plutarch's Lives" and Sheridan's "Dictionary."</p>
<p>The prison regulations were very severe. The <reg orig="Gov-|ernment">Government</reg> <lb/>
allowed twenty pence per day for the support <lb/>
of each prisoner. Ten pence was to be paid to the jailer <lb/>
for the furniture he put into the cell; tenpence only <lb/>
remained for food. The prisoners were, however, <lb/>
allowed to purchase such food as they pleased from their <lb/>
own purse. Madame Roland, with that stoicism which <lb/>
enabled her to triumph over all ordinary ills, resolved <lb/>
to conform to the prison allowance. She took bread <lb/>
and water alone for breakfast. The dinner was coarse <lb/>
meat and vegetables. The money she saved by this <lb/>
great frugality she distributed among the poorer <reg orig="pris-|oners">prisoners</reg>. <lb/>
The only indulgence she allowed herself was <lb/>
in the purchase of books and flowers. In reading and <lb/>
<pb n="222" entity="b002082275_0247"/>
with her pen she beguiled the weary days of her <reg orig="imprison-|ment">imprisonment</reg>. <lb/>
And though at times her spirit was overwhelmed <lb/>
with anguish at her desolate home and blighted hopes, <lb/>
she still found solace in the warm affections which <lb/>
sprang up around her, even in the uncongenial atmosphere <lb/>
of a prison.</p>
<p>One day some commissioners called at her cell, hoping <lb/>
to extort from her the secret of her husband's retreat. <lb/>
She looked them calmly in the face and said:</p>
<p>"Gentlemen, I know perfectly well where my husband <lb/>
is. I scorn to tell you a lie. I know, also, my own <lb/>
strength. And I assure you that there is no earthly <lb/>
power which can induce me to betray him."</p>
<p>The commissioners withdrew, admiring her heroism, <lb/>
and convinced that she was still able to wield an influence <lb/>
which might yet bring the guillotine upon their own necks. <lb/>
Her doom was sealed. Her heroism was a crime. She <lb/>
was too illustrious to live.</p>
<p>Madame Roland remained some time in the <reg orig="Ab-|bay&eacute;">Abbay&eacute;</reg> <lb/>
prison. On the twenty-fourth day of her <reg orig="im-|prisonment">imprisonment</reg>, <lb/>
to her inexpressible astonishment, an officer <lb/>
entered her cell, and informed her that she was liberated, <lb/>
as no charge could be found against her. Hardly <reg orig="cred-|iting">crediting</reg> <lb/>
her senses&mdash;fearing that she should wake up and find <lb/>
her freedom but a dream &mdash; she took a coach and <reg orig="hast-|ened">hastened</reg> <lb/>
to her own door. Her eyes were full of tears of <lb/>
joy and her heart almost bursting with delight, in the <lb/>
anticipation of again pressing her idolised child to her <lb/>
bosom. Her hand was upon the door latch &mdash; she had <lb/>
not yet passed the threshold &mdash; when two men, who had <lb/>
watched at the door of her dwelling, again seized her <lb/>
in the name of the law. In spite of her tears and <reg orig="suppli-|cations">supplications</reg>, <lb/>
<pb n="223" entity="b002082275_0248"/>
they conveyed her to the prison of St. P&eacute;lagi&eacute;. <lb/>
This loathsome receptacle of crime was filled with the <lb/>
abandoned who had been swept from the streets of Paris. <lb/>
It was, apparently, a studied humiliation, to compel <lb/>
their victim to associate with beings from whom her <lb/>
soul shrank with loathing.</p>
<p>Many hours of every day she beguiled in this prison <lb/>
in writing the memoirs of her own life. It was an <lb/>
eloquent and a touching narrative, written with the <lb/>
expectation that each sentence might be interrupted by <lb/>
the entrance of the executioners to conduct her to trial <lb/>
and to the guillotine. In this unveiling of the heart <lb/>
to the world, one sees a noble nature animated to <reg orig="benevo-|lence">benevolence</reg> <lb/>
by native generosity. The consciousness of <reg orig="spiri-|tual">spiritual</reg> <lb/>
elevation constituted her only solace. The <reg orig="anticipa-|tion">anticipation</reg> <lb/>
of a lofty reputation after death was her only heaven. <lb/>
No one can read the thoughts she penned but with the <lb/>
deepest emotion.</p>
<p>The Girondists who had been in prison were led <lb/>
from their dungeons in the Conciergerie to their <reg orig="execu-|tion">execution</reg> <lb/>
on October 31, 1793. Upon that very day <lb/>
Madame Roland was conveyed from the prison of St. <lb/>
P&eacute;lagi&eacute; to the same gloomy cells vacated by the death <lb/>
of her friends. She was cast into a bare and miserable <lb/>
dungeon, in that receptacle of woe, where there was not <lb/>
even a bed. Another prisoner, moved with compassion, <lb/>
drew his own pallet into her cell, that she might not <lb/>
be compelled to throw herself for repose upon the cold, <lb/>
wet stones. The chill air of winter had now come, and <lb/>
yet no covering was allowed her. Through the long <lb/>
night she shivered with the cold.</p>
<p>The day after Madame Roland was placed in the <lb/>
<pb n="224" entity="b002082275_0249"/>
Conciergerie, she was visited by one of the officers of <lb/>
the revolutionary party, and closely questioned <reg orig="concern-|ing">concerning</reg> <lb/>
the friendship she had entertained for the Girondists. <lb/>
She frankly avowed the affection with which she cherished <lb/>
their memory, but she declared that she and they were <lb/>
the cordial friends of republican liberty; that they wished <lb/>
to preserve, not to destroy, the Constitution. The <reg orig="ex-|amination">examination</reg> <lb/>
lasted for three hours, and consisted in an <lb/>
incessant torrent of criminations, to which she was hardly <lb/>
permitted to offer one word in reply. This examination <lb/>
taught her the nature of the accusations which would <lb/>
be brought against her. She sat down in her cell that <lb/>
very night, and, with a rapid pen, sketched that defence <lb/>
which has been pronounced one of the most eloquent <lb/>
and touching monuments of the Revolution. It so <lb/>
beautifully illustrates the heroism of her character and <lb/>
the beauty and energy of her mind that it will ever be <lb/>
read with the liveliest interest.</p>
<p>She remained in the Conciergerie but one week, and <lb/>
during that time so endeared herself to all as to become <lb/>
the prominent object of attention and love. Her case <lb/>
is one of the most extraordinary the history of the world <lb/>
has presented, in which the very highest degree of <reg orig="hero-|ism">heroism</reg> <lb/>
is combined with the most resistless loveliness. With <lb/>
an energy of will, an inflexibility of purpose, a firmness of <lb/>
endurance which no mortal man has ever exceeded, she <lb/>
combined gentleness and tenderness and affection.</p>
<p>The day before her trial, her advocate, Chauveau de <lb/>
la Garde, visited her to consult respecting her defence. <lb/>
She, well aware that no one could speak a word in her <lb/>
favour but at the peril of his own life, and also fully <lb/>
conscious that her doom was already sealed, drew a ring <lb/>
from her finger, and said to him:</p>
<pb n="225" entity="b002082275_0250"/>
<p>"To-morrow I shall be no more. I know the fate <lb/>
which awaits me. Your kind assistance cannot avail <lb/>
aught for me, and would but endanger you. I pray <lb/>
you, therefore, not to come to the tribunal, but to accept <lb/>
of this last testimony of my regard."</p>
<p>The next day she was led to her trial. She attired <reg orig="her-|self">herself</reg> <lb/>
in a white robe, as a symbol of her innocence, and <lb/>
her long dark hair fell in thick curls on her neck and <lb/>
shoulders. She emerged from her dungeon a vision <lb/>
of unusual loveliness. The prisoners who were walking <lb/>
in the corridors gathered around her, and with smiles and <lb/>
words of encouragement she infused energy into their <lb/>
hearts. Calm and invincible she met her judges. <reg orig="When-|ever">Whenever</reg> <lb/>
she attempted to utter a word in her defence, she <lb/>
was browbeaten by the judges, and silenced by the <lb/>
clamours of the mob which filled the tribunal. At last <lb/>
the president demanded of her that she should reveal <lb/>
her husband's asylum. She proudly replied:</p>
<p>"I do not know of any law by which I can be obliged <lb/>
to violated the strongest feelings of nature."</p>
<p>This was sufficient, and she was immediately <reg orig="con-|demned">condemned</reg>. <lb/>
Her sentence was thus expressed: <lb/>
<q>The public accuser has drawn up the present indictment <lb/>
against Jane Mary Phlippon, the wife of Roland, late Minister <lb/>
of the Interior, for having wickedly and designedly aided and <lb/>
assisted in the conspiracy which existed against the unity and <lb/>
indivisibility of the Republic, against the liberty and safety of the <lb/>
French people, by assembling, at her house, in secret council, the <lb/>
principal chiefs of that conspiracy, and by keeping up a <reg orig="corre-|spondence">correspondence</reg> <lb/>
tending to facilitate their treasonable designs. The <lb/>
tribunal, having heard the public accuser deliver his reasons <reg orig="con-|cerning">concerning</reg> <lb/>
the application of the law, condemns Jane Mary Phlippon, <lb/>
wife of Roland, to the punishment of death.</q></p>
<p>She listened calmly to her sentence, and then, <lb/>
<pb n="226" entity="b002082275_0251"/>
rising, bowed with dignity to her judges and, smiling, <lb/>
said:</p>
<p>"I thank you, gentlemen, for thinking me worthy of <lb/>
sharing the fate of the great men whom you have <reg orig="assas-|sinated">assassinated</reg>. <lb/>
I shall endeavour to imitate their firmness on <lb/>
the scaffold."</p>
<p>With the buoyant step of a child, and with a rapidity <lb/>
which almost betokened joy, she passed beneath the <lb/>
narrow portal, and descended to her cell, from which <lb/>
she was to be led, with the morning light, to death. The <lb/>
prisoners had assembled to greet her on her return, and <lb/>
anxiously gathered round her. She looked upon them <lb/>
with a smile of perfect tranquillity, and, drawing her <lb/>
hand across her neck, made a sign expressive of her doom.</p>
<p>The morning of the 8th of November, 1793, dawned <lb/>
gloomily upon Paris. It was one of the darkest days <lb/>
of that reign of terror which, for so long a period, <reg orig="envel-|oped">enveloped</reg> <lb/>
France in its sombre shades. The ponderous <lb/>
gates of the courtyard of the Conciergerie opened that <lb/>
morning to a long procession of carts loaded with <reg orig="vic-|tims">victims</reg> <lb/>
for the guillotine. Madame Roland had <reg orig="contem-|plated">contemplated</reg> <lb/>
her fate too long, and had disciplined her spirit <lb/>
too severely, to fail of fortitude in this last hour of trial. <lb/>
She came from her cell scrupulously attired. A serene <lb/>
smile was upon her cheeks, and the glow of joyous <reg orig="ani-|mation">animation</reg> <lb/>
lighted up her features as she waved an adieu <lb/>
to the weeping prisoners who gathered round her. The <lb/>
last cart was assigned to Madame Roland. She entered <lb/>
it with a step as light and elastic as if it were a carriage <lb/>
for a morning's drive. By her side stood an infirm old <lb/>
man, M. La Marche. He was pale and trembling, <lb/>
and his fainting heart, in view of the approaching terror, <lb/>
almost ceased to beat. She sustained him by her arm <lb/>
<pb n="227" entity="b002082275_0252"/>
and addressed to him words of consolation and <reg orig="encour-|agement">encouragement</reg>, <lb/>
in cheerful accents and with a benignant smile. <lb/>
She stood firmly in the cart, looking with a serene eye <lb/>
upon the crowds which lined the streets, and listening <lb/>
to the clamour which filled the air. A crowd surrounded <lb/>
the cart shouting:</p>
<p>"To the guillotine! to the guillotine!"</p>
<p>She looked kindly upon them, and bending over the <lb/>
railing of the cart, said to them in tones as placid as if <lb/>
she were addressing her own child:</p>
<p>"My friends, I <hi rend="italic">am</hi> going to the guillotine. In a few <lb/>
moments I shall be there. They who send me thither <lb/>
will ere long follow me. I go innocent. They will come <lb/>
stained with blood. You who now applaud our <reg orig="execu-|tion">execution</reg> <lb/>
will then applaud theirs with equal zeal."</p>
<p>The long procession arrived at the guillotine, and the <lb/>
bloody work began. The victims were dragged from <lb/>
the carts, and the axe rose and fell with unceasing <lb/>
rapidity. Head after head fell into the basket. The <lb/>
executioners approached the cart where Madame Roland <lb/>
stood by the side of her fainting companion. With an <lb/>
animated countenance and a cheerful smile, she was <lb/>
endeavouring to infuse fortitude into his soul. The <lb/>
executioner grasped her by the arm.</p>
<p>"Stay," said she, slightly resisting his grasp; "I have <lb/>
one favour to ask, and that is not for myself. I beseech <lb/>
you grant it me." Then turning to the old man she said: <lb/>
"Do you precede me to the scaffold. To see my blood <lb/>
flow would make you suffer the bitterness of death twice <lb/>
over. I must spare you the pain of witnessing my <lb/>
execution."</p>
<p>The stern officer gave a surly refusal, replying: "My <lb/>
orders are to take you first."</p>
<pb n="228" entity="b002082275_0253"/>
<p>With that winning smile and that fascinating grace <lb/>
which were almost resistless, she rejoined: "You <lb/>
cannot, surely, refuse a woman her last request."</p>
<p>The hard-hearted executor of the law was brought <lb/>
within the influence of her enchantment. He paused, <lb/>
looked at her for a moment in bewilderment, and yielded. <lb/>
The poor old man, more dead than alive, was conducted <lb/>
upon the scaffold and placed beneath the fatal axe. <lb/>
Madame Roland, without the slightest change of colour, <lb/>
or the apparent tremor of a nerve, saw the ponderous <lb/>
instrument, with its glittering edge, glide upon its deadly <lb/>
mission, and the decapitated trunk of her friend was <lb/>
thrown aside to give place for her. With a placid <lb/>
countenance and a buoyant step she ascended the <lb/>
steps. She stood for a moment upon the platform, <lb/>
looked calmly around upon the vast concourse, and then <lb/>
bowing before a clay statue of Liberty near by exclaimed: <lb/>
"O Liberty! what crimes are committed in thy name." <lb/>
She surrendered herself to the executioner, and was <lb/>
bound to the plank. The plank fell to its horizontal <lb/>
position, bringing her head under the fatal axe. The <lb/>
glittering steel glided through the groove, and the head <lb/>
of Madame Roland was severed from her body.</p>
<p>The grief of M. Roland, when apprised of the event, <lb/>
was unbounded. For a time he entirely lost his senses. <lb/>
Life to him was no longer endurable. Privately he <lb/>
left by night, the kind friends who had concealed him <lb/>
for six months, and wandered to such a distance from his <lb/>
asylum as to secure his protectors from any danger on <lb/>
his account. Through the long hours of the winter's <lb/>
night he continued his dreary walk, till the first gray of <lb/>
the morning appeared. Drawing a long stiletto from <lb/>
the inside of his walking-stick, he placed the head <unclear id="u15">of i</unclear> <lb/>
<pb n="229" entity="b002082275_0254"/>
against the trunk of a tree, and threw himself upon the <lb/>
sharp weapon. The point pierced his heart and he <lb/>
fell lifeless upon the frozen ground. Some peasants <reg orig="pass-|ing">passing</reg> <lb/>
by discovered his body. A piece of paper was <lb/>
pinned to the breast of his coat, upon which there were <lb/>
written these words: <lb/>
<q>Whoever thou art that findest these remains, respect them as <lb/>
those of a virtuous man. After hearing of my wife's death, I <lb/>
would not stay another day in a world so stained with crime.</q></p>
<p>The daughter of Madame Roland succeeded in <reg orig="escap-|ing">escaping</reg> <lb/>
the fury of the tyrants of the Revolution. She lived <lb/>
surrounded by kind protectors, and in subsequent years <lb/>
was married to M. Champeneaux, the son of one of her <lb/>
mother's intimate friends.</p>

GRACE DARLING</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Grace darling</hi> was born on the 24th on <lb/>
November, I815, at a small town upon the <lb/>
northeastern coast of England. She was the seventh <lb/>
child of her parents. Her grandfather, Robert Darling, <lb/>
had been keeper of the coal-light on the outmost of <lb/>
the Farne Islands, and her father, William, <reg orig="suc-|ceeded">succeeded</reg> <lb/>
him in that post. In I826, however, when <lb/>
Grace was eleven years old, William Darling took his <lb/>
family to Longstone, another island of the same <lb/>
group.</p>
<p>These Farne Islands are about twenty-five in number <lb/>
at low tide, and, as a visitor has pointed out, are desolate <lb/>
to an uncommon degree, although they are at no great <lb/>
distance from the Northumberland coast. The sea <lb/>
rushes with great force through the channels between <lb/>
the islands. Longstone, upon which Grace dwelt was, <lb/>
says another visitor, of dark whinstone, cracked in every <lb/>
direction and worn with the action of winds, waves and <lb/>
tempests, since the world began. Over the greater part <lb/>
of it was not a blade of grass nor a grain of earth; it was <lb/>
hard and iron-like stone, crusted round all the coast as <lb/>
far as high water-mark with limpet and still smaller <lb/>
shells. We ascended wrinkled hills of black stone, and <lb/>
descended into worn and dismal dells of the same, into <lb/>
some of which, where the tide got entrance, it came <reg orig="pour-|ing">pouring</reg> <lb/>
and roaring in raging whiteness, and churning the <lb/>
<pb n="231" entity="b002082275_0256"/>
loose fragments of whinstone into round pebbles, and <lb/>
piling them up in deep crevices, with seaweed. Over our <lb/>
heads screamed hundreds of hovering birds, the gull <lb/>
mingling its hideous laughter most wildly.</p>
<p>Fancy a lone lighthouse standing upon this pile of <lb/>
stone, dropped seemingly, in the midst of the water, <lb/>
five miles from the mainland. The sea tosses, and <lb/>
swells, and beats the rocks unceasingly. In fine weather <lb/>
it is blue and more kindly; in storms the waters are <lb/>
black and furious and fearful. It was known as a most <lb/>
desolate and dangerous lighthouse, and its service <lb/>
could be only a man and family of courage, endurance, <lb/>
large human feeling and strong sense of duty.</p>
<p>In such an abode grew the little girl, almost alone <lb/>
so far as school friends go. Her father taught her to <lb/>
read and write together with the seven of her brothers <lb/>
and sisters, and their schoolroom was the lantern of <lb/>
the lighthouse. Her instructors were in other ways the <lb/>
sky and the breaking surf; her comrades the sea birds <lb/>
and the simple shell fish and floating grasses of the <lb/>
salt water and all the strange and curious growths the <lb/>
sea brings wherever it is free.</p>
<p>Like her brothers and sisters, Grace was schooled after <lb/>
the simpler fashion. But when such days were passed <lb/>
she kept to her home rather than go out into the world <lb/>
or marry. The lighthouse sheltered a united and happy <lb/>
family. Grace loved the seclusion of that life and assisted <lb/>
her mother with the work of the household. Others of <lb/>
the daughters had gone to homes of their own upon <lb/>
the mainland.</p>
<p>If our surroundings help to form our characters, here <lb/>
in this lighthouse Grace must have grown into a strong <lb/>
self-control and a spirit of helpfulness toward hapless <lb/>
<pb n="232" entity="b002082275_0257"/>
people and those wrecks upon the Farne Islands, of <lb/>
which many a legend has been told.</p>
<p>About thirty years before she was born a fine <reg orig="mer-|chantman">merchantman</reg> <lb/>
from America had struck the ledges near the <lb/>
lighthouse, and it is said that to the recital of this <reg orig="ship-|wreck">shipwreck</reg>, <lb/>
of how the brave sailors fought for life and how <lb/>
one by one they fell of were swept into the fierce waters, <lb/>
the little girl would listen weeping, and then go pitifully <lb/>
to her bed. This tale, and the story of other sea mishaps, <lb/>
had a special attraction for the child, and the strength <lb/>
of her interest and compassion for the shipwrecked <lb/>
were noticed by her family as they sat round the family <lb/>
table of an evening, knitting, talking of the sea and <lb/>
watching the bright beacon above.</p>
<p>So it was that Grace Darling grew to womanhood. <lb/>
She was twenty-two years old when the disaster came <lb/>
that made evident what sort of a girl had come to woman's <lb/>
years upon the solitary island.</p>
<p>In the fall of the year, 1838, one fifth of September, <lb/>
a steamer, called the <hi rend="italic">Forfarshire,</hi> a vessel of small size, <lb/>
but laden with a considerable cargo, sailed for Dundee, <lb/>
Scotland, from the port of Hull, England. There were <lb/>
forty-one passengers and twenty-two of the crew &mdash; <lb/>
sixty-three in all. The ship was but two years old, <lb/>
but her boilers were in bad order, although they had had <lb/>
some overhauling before she cleared her port.</p>
<p>She sailed in the early evening and for a part of her <lb/>
way seemed to be steaming safely. But as the vessel <lb/>
neared Flamborough Head the captain and crew became <lb/>
disturbed by many anxieties. Word passed from mouth <lb/>
to mouth among the passengers that the leak of the <lb/>
boiler was growing rapidly and the firemen could with <lb/>
difficulty keep up the fires. So much did this delay the <lb/>
<pb n="233" entity="b002082275_0258"/>
passage of the steamer that toward the evening of the <lb/>
following day she had only made the channel between <lb/>
the coast and the Farne Islands. The wind was blowing <lb/>
from the north. It is reported that the engines became <lb/>
utterly useless. There being great danger of drifting <lb/>
ashore, the sails were hoisted fore and aft, and the vessel <lb/>
got about in order to get her before the wind and keep <lb/>
her off the land. It rained heavily during the entire <lb/>
time, and the fog was so dense that it became impossible <lb/>
to tell the situation of the vessel. At length breakers <lb/>
were discovered close to leeward, and the Farne Light, <lb/>
which about the same period became visible, left no <lb/>
doubt as to the peril of all on board.</p>
<p>Passengers crowded the deck and as rain beat upon <lb/>
them and the fog shut out all but the sad scene on board, <lb/>
friends and strangers pressed hands for support and <lb/>
sought hopeful words from one another's lips. The <lb/>
sails hoisted for a defence became useless for the purpose, <lb/>
the wind was rising to tempest strength, and all control <lb/>
over the vessel seemed gone. The sea was master and <lb/>
was tossing the helpless steamer in its waves, and, as the <lb/>
summer wind drives thistledown in its course, was driving <lb/>
her toward the light. The billows beat upon the frail <lb/>
timbers and every lurch and swell took vessel nearer <lb/>
the island where the wild waters were breaking in foam.</p>
<p>At length appeared in an opening of the fog a great <lb/>
rock, frightfully rugged, deadly to a ship weakened and <lb/>
in the power of the sea. Passengers and crew alike <lb/>
knew the spot, and they knew that unless some miracle <lb/>
prevailed the ship must go to pieces. There was a <lb/>
moment's delay, the sea seemed putting off its final <lb/>
victory, and then it brought the vessel with her bow <reg orig="fore-|most">foremost</reg> <lb/>
upon the rocks.</p>
<pb n="234" entity="b002082275_0259"/>
<p>A panic followed. All who had been below rushed <lb/>
to the deck and sought in the companionship of <reg orig="wretch-|edness">wretchedness</reg> <lb/>
an escape from threatening destruction. Some of <lb/>
the crew, determined to save themselves, lowered the <lb/>
larboard quarter boat, and left the ship. The boiling <lb/>
sea now swept over the decks.</p>
<p>Very soon after the first shock a powerful wave struck <lb/>
the vessel on the quarter, and raising her off the rocks <lb/>
allowed her immediately after to fall violently upon it, <lb/>
the sharp edge striking her amidships. She was by this <lb/>
fairty broken in two pieces, and the after part, containing <lb/>
the cabin with many passengers was instantly carried off <lb/>
through a tremendous current, called the Piper Gut. <lb/>
The captain and his wife were among those who perished.</p>
<p>The forepart still remained crushed upon the rocks. <lb/>
Upon its deck were eight unfortunate creatures &mdash; five <lb/>
sailors and three of the passengers. In the cabin below <lb/>
lay a woman huddling two children in her arms, a girl <lb/>
of eleven and a boy of eight. The waves washed through <lb/>
the cabin tearing off the clothing of the children and half <lb/>
freezing them with cold. The hideous noise of the <reg orig="tem-|pest">tempest</reg> <lb/>
drowned their melancholy cries and at last they <lb/>
lay quiet and dead.</p>
<p>At the Longstone Lighthouse the morning of the <lb/>
seventh of September broke mistily. The dwellers there <lb/>
were but three&mdash;the keeper and his wife and daughter. <lb/>
They were used to raging seas and driving winds, but <lb/>
this night had been one of anxiety. Grace, it is said, <lb/>
had been unable to sleep, and as she dozed toward <lb/>
morning had started up with a wail for help echoing in <lb/>
her ears. She roused her father and taking his <reg orig="field-|glass">field-glass</reg> <lb/>
sought the wreck which she felt must be near. <lb/>
The remains of the shattered vessel lying about a mile <lb/>
<pb n="235" entity="b002082275_0260"/>
off met her eye, and dim figure clinging to the broken <lb/>
timbers. As the waters lashed the wreck it seemed as <lb/>
if each wave must sweep the forms into the sea.</p>
<p>The hearts of all three of the lighthouse family sank. <lb/>
What could three do and the billows running <reg orig="moun-|tains">mountains</reg>? <lb/>
William Darling shrank from attempting any <lb/>
rescue. He had been on other humane enterprises. <lb/>
But this seemed futile. At Grace's earnest plea the <lb/>
boat was launched, her father yielding to her entreaties, <lb/>
which his heart said were right. Grace sprang in &mdash; she <lb/>
knew how to handle an oar &mdash; and her father followed. <lb/>
She had never assisted in the boat before this wreck of <lb/>
the <hi rend="italic">Forfarshire,</hi> but other members of the family had <lb/>
been present.</p>
<p>Her mother, Mrs. Darling, had assisted in making <lb/>
the boat ready, but as her husband and daughter pushed <lb/>
off, and the waves washed the rock on which she stood, <lb/>
she cried with tears in her eyes:</p>
<p>"Oh, Grace, if your father is lost, I'll blame you <lb/>
for this morning's work."</p>
<p>Says one who told the story:</p>
<p>"In estimating the dangers which heroic adventurers <lb/>
encounter, one circumstance ought not to be forgotten. <lb/>
Had it been at ebb tide the boat could not have passed <lb/>
between the islands; and Darling and his daughter knew <lb/>
that the tide would be flowing on their return, when their <lb/>
united strength would have been utterly insufficient <lb/>
to pull the boat back to the lighthouse island. Had <lb/>
they not got aid of the surviviors in rowing back again, <lb/>
they themselves would have been compelled to remain <lb/>
on the rock beside the wreck until the tide ebbed again."</p>
<p>The frail boat passed over the stormy waters and <lb/>
neared the rock.</p>
<pb n="236" entity="b002082275_0261"/>
<p>It could only have been by the exertion of muscular <lb/>
power as well as determined courage that the father and <lb/>
daughter carried the boat to the rock. And when there <lb/>
a danger, greater even than that which they had <reg orig="encount-|ered">encountered</reg> <lb/>
in approaching it, arose from the difficulty of <reg orig="steady-|ing">steadying</reg> <lb/>
the boat and preventing its being destroyed on those <lb/>
sharp ridges by the ever-restless chafing and heaving of <lb/>
the billows.</p>
<p>The father and daughter could see the eager faces <lb/>
turned toward them, and the sight redoubled their <lb/>
efforts in reaching the rock, and in the task of <reg orig="disem-|barking">disembarking</reg> <lb/>
and drawing the boat up the rock and out of <lb/>
reach of the waves. It was a perilous landing-place. <lb/>
But when the craft was secured the father and Grace <lb/>
approached the half-dead group.</p>
<p>All were safe except the two children. Their mother <lb/>
was seemingly dead, also, and lay clasping the bodies <lb/>
in her arms. But care and attention revived her. A <lb/>
fireman who had lain for three hours on the rock where <lb/>
he had been tossed, had clung to a strong nail spiked <lb/>
in the rock, and though lashed and beaten by the <lb/>
waves, and tortured by bleeding hands, he had not <lb/>
let go.</p>
<p>The rescuers placed the survivors one by one in the <lb/>
boat. But the return journey was even more perilous <lb/>
than that which took them to the wreck, although the <lb/>
sailors aided at the oars. Longstone, however, was at <lb/>
last reached and the sufferers housed in the lighthouse.</p>
<p>They were in safety, but the violence of the sea <reg orig="for-|bade">forbade</reg> <lb/>
any attempt to reach the mainland. There were <lb/>
good accommodations at the light. The tower was <lb/>
ingeniously built, and besides a well-furnished <reg orig="sitting-|room">sitting-room</reg>, <lb/>
in which was a capital collection of books, had <lb/>
<pb n="237" entity="b002082275_0262"/>
three or four comfortable bedrooms. In addition there <lb/>
was an abundance of wholesome, homely fare.</p>
<p>The poor woman who had lost her children was <reg orig="suffer-|ing">suffering</reg> <lb/>
intensely, and to her Grace gave up her bed, sleeping <lb/>
upon a table. A boat's crew from Northumberland <lb/>
which after some hours came in search of the <hi rend="italic">Forfarshire,</hi> <lb/>
also had to claim the hospitality of the lighthouse, and <lb/>
for three days were held by the raging seas. Finally, <lb/>
the passage to the mainland was undertaken in safety, <lb/>
and the news reached the keeper's family that the boat <lb/>
first launched had been picked up and its nine <reg orig="passen-|gers">passengers</reg> <lb/>
rescued. Of the sixty-three who had sailed from <lb/>
Hull five days before, nineteen were alive.</p>
<p>Within a few days search was made for the missing <lb/>
bodies, but almost in vain. The cargo of the steamer, <lb/>
which was of unusual value was wholly lost. The wreck, <lb/>
consisting of the engine, paddle-wheels, anchor, foremast <lb/>
and rigging, remained upon the rock and was visited <lb/>
by thousands.</p>
<p>Report of Grace Darling's heroic deed was soon <lb/>
spread throughout England. It was a simple, humane <lb/>
action and such actions are doing among us all the time. <lb/>
But the courage in facing the elemental rage of the sea, <lb/>
and the helpful sympathy with the unfortunate which <lb/>
it made evident, appealed to the popular heart, and <lb/>
Grace became a people's heroine. Public subscriptions <lb/>
were at once set on foot to express by a splendid gift <lb/>
the universal sense of her deserts. Many smaller tokens <lb/>
also came to her. Among them was a silver medal which <lb/>
read: <lb/>
<q>Presented by the Glasgow Humane Society to Miss Grace <lb/>
Horsley Darling, in admiration of her dauntless and heroic <reg orig="con-|duct">conduct</reg> <lb/>
in saving &lpar;along with her father&rpar; the lives of nine persons <lb/>
from the wreck of the <hi rend="italic">Forfarshire</hi> steamer, 7th September, 1838</q></p>
<pb n="238" entity="b002082275_0263"/>
<p>So great was popular report and admiration for the <lb/>
heroine that me manager of a theatre breached to her <lb/>
the plan of representing the rescue, in part at least, upon <lb/>
his stage, and offered her a considerable sum for sitting <lb/>
in the boat for the audience to view. Her portrait was <lb/>
taken and sold everywhere, She was generally flattered <lb/>
and caressed.</p>
<p>It was now that we find the true balance and strength <lb/>
in Grace's character. The testimonials she received <lb/>
with quiet pleasure. But she preferred to remain upon <lb/>
the solitary island under the light, and aid her mother in <lb/>
her simple household work.</p>
<p>She was glad to have saved lives at the risk of her <lb/>
own, she said, and would most willingly do it again <lb/>
if opportunity should occur. But she could not feel <lb/>
that she had done anything great, and certainly she did <lb/>
not wish for the praise that had been bestowed upon <lb/>
her. As for going to the theatre to receive the plaudits <lb/>
of a curious crowd, that was the last thing she desired.</p>
<p>Of Grace at this time the pleasing English writer, <lb/>
William Howitt, gives this account. He paid a visit <lb/>
to Longstone and met the heroine:</p>
<p>"When I went she was not visible, and I was afraid I <lb/>
should not see her, as her father said she very much <lb/>
disliked meeting strangers that she thought came to <lb/>
stare at her; but when the old man and I had had a little <lb/>
conversation he went up to her room, and soon came down <lb/>
with a smile, saying that she would be with us soon. So <lb/>
when we had been up to the top lighthouse, and had <lb/>
seen its machinery, and taken a good look-out at the <lb/>
distant shore, and Darling bad pointed out the spot of <lb/>
the wreck, and the way they took the people off, we went <lb/>
down and found Grace sitting at her sewing, very neatly <lb/>
<pb n="239" entity="b002082275_0264"/>
but very simply dressed in a plain sort of striped print <lb/>
gown, with her watch-seal just seen at her side and her <lb/>
hair neatly braided&mdash;just, in fact, as such girls are <lb/>
dressed, only not quite so smart as they often are. She <lb/>
rose, very modestly, and with a pleasant smile said <lb/>
'How do you do, sir?'</p>
<p>"Her figure is by no means striking&mdash;quite the <reg orig="con-|trary">contrary</reg>; <lb/>
but her face it full of sense, modesty and genuine <lb/>
goodness; and that is just the character she bears. Her <lb/>
prudence delights one. We are charmed that she should <lb/>
so well have supported the brilliancy of her humane <lb/>
deeds. It is confirmative of the notion that such actions <lb/>
must spring from genuine heart and mind."</p>
<p>She had the sweetest smile, continued Mr. Howitt, <lb/>
that he had ever seen in a person of her station and <lb/>
appearance. "You see that she is a thoroughly good <lb/>
creature, and that under her modest exterior lies a spirit <lb/>
capable of the most exalted devotion, a devotion so <lb/>
entire that daring is not so much a quality of her nature, <lb/>
as that the most perfect sympathy with suffering or <lb/>
endangered humanity swallows up and annihilates <lb/>
everything like fear or self-consideration, puts out, in <lb/>
fact, every sentiment but itself."</p>
<p>As we read above Grace was slight of frame, and not <lb/>
markedly robust. Barely three years after the wreck <lb/>
at which her pity and heroism had won her world-wide <lb/>
fame, she showed evidences of decline. Toward the <lb/>
close of 1841 she was taken from Longstone and placed <lb/>
under the care of a doctor in Bamborough. Not gaining <lb/>
in strength she begged to be moved to Wooler, a small <lb/>
market town on the border of Northumberland, where <lb/>
the scenery is of the Cheviot Hills &mdash; of sunny heights <lb/>
and wooded glens. But even here the clear bracing air <lb/>
<pb n="240" entity="b002082275_0265"/>
had little help for her illness, and after meeting her <lb/>
father and considering her failing strength, with his <lb/>
advice she returned to Bamborough. Her eldest sister <lb/>
nursed her with devotion, but it was evident her life was <lb/>
fading.</p>
<p>Throughout her illness she never murmured and <lb/>
never complained, we are are told, and shortly before <lb/>
her death she expressed a wish to see as many of her <lb/>
relations as the peculiar nature of their employment <lb/>
would admit, and with surprising fortitude and <reg orig="self-|command">self-command</reg> <lb/>
she delivered to each one of them some token <lb/>
of remembrance. This done she calmly awaited the <lb/>
approach of death; and finally, on October 20, 1842, <lb/>
resigned her spirit without a murmur.</p>
<p>Two stones have been raised to her memory, one in <lb/>
the Bamborough churchyard, her figure lying at length; <lb/>
and another in the chapel of St. Cuthbert, on one of the <lb/>
Farne Islands, and bearing this memorial: <lb/>
<q><hi rend="small-caps">to the memory of <lb/>
Grace Horsley Darling <lb/>
a native of bamborough and an inhabitant <lb/>
of these islands <lb/>
who died october 20th, 1842, <lb/>
aged 26 years.</hi></q></p>
<p>But the best memorial of a heroine is the inspiration <lb/>
her example offers to her own generation and those that <lb/>
succeed her, the love her deeds engender in other hearts, <lb/>
the enlarging and uplifting of our kind through her <reg orig="en-|deavour">endeavour</reg>. <lb/>
And so it is that the heroine of Farne Islands <lb/>
has become a lovely memory to us, and to those who <lb/>
shall come after us.</p>

SISTER DORA</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Dorothy wyndlow pattison</hi> was born <lb/>
on January 15th, 1832. She was the <reg orig="young-|est">youngest</reg> <lb/>
daughter, and the youngest child but one, of the <lb/>
Rev. Mark Pattison, who was for many years Rector of <lb/>
Hauxwell, near Richmond, in Yorkshire. She inherited <lb/>
from her father, who was of a Devonshire family, that <lb/>
finely proportioned and graceful figure which she always <lb/>
maintained; and from her mother, who was the <reg orig="daugh-|ter">daughter</reg> <lb/>
of a banker in Richmond, those lovely features which <lb/>
drew forth the admiration of everyone who had the <lb/>
pleasure of knowing her.</p>
<p>Her father was a good and sincere man. He was <lb/>
thoroughly upright and strict.</p>
<p>Dora and her sister, like a thousand other country <lb/>
parsons' daughters, were of the utmost use in their <lb/>
father's Yorkshire parish. A French gentleman who <lb/>
had lived a while in England and in the country, said <lb/>
to me one day:</p>
<p>"Your young ladies astound me. They are angels <lb/>
of mercy. They wear no distinguishing habit; one <lb/>
does not see their wings, yet they fly everywhere, and <lb/>
everywhere bring grace and love and peace &mdash; in my <lb/>
country such a thing would be impossible."</p>
<p>These Pattison girls were for ever saving their pocket <lb/>
money to give it away, and they made it a rule to mend <lb/>
and remake their old frocks, so as not to have to buy <lb/>
<pb n="242" entity="b002082275_0267"/>
new ones out of their allowance for clothes, so as to <lb/>
have more to give. Even their dinners they would <lb/>
reserve for poor people, and content themselves with <lb/>
bread and cheese. "Giving to others instead of spending <lb/>
on themselves seems to have been the rule and delight <lb/>
of their lives."</p>
<p>A pretty story is told of Dorothy at this time. A <lb/>
schoolboy in the village, who was especially attached to <lb/>
her, fell ill of rheumatic fever. The boy's one longing <lb/>
was to see "Miss Dora" again, but she was abroad on <lb/>
the Continent. As he grew worse and worse, he <reg orig="con-|stantly">constantly</reg> <lb/>
prayed that he might live long enough to see her. <lb/>
On the day on which she was expected, he sat up on his <lb/>
pillows intently listening, and at last, long before <reg orig="any-|one">anyone</reg> <lb/>
else could hear a sound of wheels, he exclaimed: <lb/>
"There she is!" and sank back. She went to him at <lb/>
once, and nursed him till he died.</p>
<p>Her beauty was very great: large brilliant, brown <lb/>
eyes, ful red lips, a firm chin and a finely cut profile; <lb/>
her hair dark, and slightly curling, waved all over her <lb/>
head; and the remarkable beauty and delicacy of her <lb/>
colouring and complexion, added to the liveliness of <lb/>
her expression, made her a fascinating creature to behold. <lb/>
Her father always called her "Little Sunshine."</p>
<p>But the most remarkable feature about her was to <lb/>
be found in her inner being. A will, which no earthly <lb/>
power could subdue, enabled her to accomplish an <lb/>
almost superhuman work; yet at times it was to her a <lb/>
faculty that brought her into difficulties. She was <lb/>
twenty-nine before she was able to find real scope for <lb/>
her energies, and then she took a bold step&mdash;answered <lb/>
an advertisement from a clergyman for a lady to take <lb/>
the village school. Her mother had died in 1861, and <lb/>
<pb n="243" entity="b002082275_0268"/>
she considered herself free from duties that bound her <lb/>
to her home. Her father did not relish the step she took, <lb/>
but acquiesced. She went to Woolston, and remained <lb/>
there three years, during which time she won the hearts, <lb/>
not of the children only, but of their parents as well. she <lb/>
had to live alone in a cottage, and do everything for her <lb/>
self; but the people never for a moment doubted she <lb/>
was a real lady, and always treated her with great respect.</p>
<p>Not thinking a little village school sufficient field <lb/>
for her energies, she resolved to join a nursing sisterhood <lb/>
at Redcar, in Yorkshire. The life was not quite suited <lb/>
to her strong will, but it did her good. She there learned <lb/>
how to make beds and to cook. At first she literally sat <lb/>
down and cried when the beds which she had just put in <lb/>
order were all pulled to pieces by some superior <reg orig="author-|ity">authority</reg>, <lb/>
who did not approve of the method in which they <lb/>
were made. But it was a useful lesson for her after <lb/>
life in a hospital. She was there till the early part <lb/>
of 1865, and then was sent to Walsall to help at a small <lb/>
cottage hospital, which had already been established <lb/>
for more than a year.</p>
<p>Walsall, though not in the "Black Country," is in <lb/>
a busy manufacturing district, chiefly of iron. At the <lb/>
time when Sister Dora went there it contained a <reg orig="popula-|tion">population</reg> <lb/>
of 35,000 inhabitants. It is now connected with <lb/>
Birmingham by almost continuous houses and pits and <lb/>
furnaces.</p>
<p>As fresh coal and iron pits were being opened in the <lb/>
district around Walsall, accidents became more frequent, <lb/>
and it was found impracticable to send those injured <lb/>
to Birmingham, which was seven miles distant; <reg orig="Accord-|ingly">Accordingly</reg>, <lb/>
in 1863, the Town Council invited the Redcar <lb/>
Society to start a hospital there. When the Sister who <lb/>
<pb n="244" entity="b002082275_0269"/>
had begun the work fell ill, Sister Dora was sent in her <lb/>
place, and almost directly caught small-pox form the <lb/>
outpatients. She was very ill, and even in her delirium <lb/>
showed the bent of her mind by ripping her sheets into <lb/>
strips to serve as bandages.</p>
<p>When the cottage hospital &mdash; which was the second <lb/>
of its kind in England &mdash; was opened, the system of <reg orig="vol-|untary">voluntary</reg> <lb/>
nursing was unknown; the only voluntary nurses <lb/>
heard of then being those who had gone out to the Crimea <lb/>
with Miss Florence Nightingale. Therefore a good deal <lb/>
of misunderstanding was the result; but in the course of <lb/>
time people began to judge the institution by its results. <lb/>
But Sister Dora, by her frank, open manner, disarmed <lb/>
suspicion, while the sublime eloquence of noble deeds <lb/>
silenced tongues, and won for the hospital the confidence <lb/>
of the public, and for herself the admiration and affection <lb/>
of the people.</p>
<p>In 1866 she had a serious illness, brought on by <reg orig="expo-|sure">exposure</reg> <lb/>
to wet and cold. She would come home from <reg orig="dress-|ing">dressing</reg> <lb/>
wounds in the cottages, wet through and hot with <lb/>
hurrying along the streets, to find a crowd of outpatients <lb/>
awaiting her return at the hospital, and she would attend <lb/>
to them in total disregard of herself, and allow her wet <lb/>
clothes to dry on her.</p>
<p>This neglect occurred once too often; a chill settled <lb/>
on her, and for three weeks she was dangerously ill. <lb/>
Then it was that the people of Walsall began to realise <lb/>
what she was, and the door of the hospital was besieged <lb/>
by poor people come to inquire how their "Sister Dora" <lb/>
was.</p>
<p>The hospital had moved men of every shade of <reg orig="poli-|tics">politics</reg>, <lb/>
and every form of religious belief, to the work, <lb/>
and there have been passages in its history not pleasant <lb/>
<pb n="245" entity="b002082275_0270"/>
to remember, but not one of these in the remotest degree <lb/>
involved Sister Dora. On the contrary, her presence <lb/>
and counsel always brought light and peace, and lifted <lb/>
every question into a higher sphere. "Ask Sister Dora," <lb/>
it used to be said. "Had we not better send for Sister <lb/>
Dora" some member would exclaim out of the fog of <lb/>
contention. Thereupon she would appear; and many <lb/>
well remember how calmly self-possessed, and <reg orig="clear-|sighted">clear-sighted</reg> <lb/>
she would stand &mdash; never sit down. Indeed, <lb/>
there were those who worked with her fifteen years who <lb/>
never saw her seated; she would stand, usually with her <lb/>
hand on the back of the chair which had been placed <lb/>
for her, every eye directed to her; nor was it ever many <lb/>
moments before she had grasped the whole question, <lb/>
and given her opinion just as clearly and simply and <lb/>
straight to the purpose as any opinion given to the <reg orig="suffer-|ers">sufferers</reg> <lb/>
in the wards. Nor was she ever wrong; nor did she <lb/>
ever fail of her purpose with the committee. No <reg orig="commit-|teemen">committeemen</reg> <lb/>
ever questioned or differed from Sister Dora, <lb/>
yet in her was the charm of unconsciousness of power <lb/>
or superiority and the impression left was of there being <lb/>
no feeling of pleasure in her, other than the triumph of <lb/>
the right.</p>
<p>In 1867 the cottage hospital had to be abandoned, <lb/>
as erysipelas broke out and would not be expelled. <lb/>
The wards were evidently impregnated with malignant <lb/>
germs to such an extent that the committee resolved <lb/>
to build a new hospital in a better situation.</p>
<p>Sister Dora's work became more engrossing when <lb/>
this larger field was opened for it; the men's beds were <lb/>
constantly full, and even the women's ward was hardly <lb/>
ever entirely empty.</p>
<p>Just at this period an epidemic of small-pox broke out <lb/>
<pb n="246" entity="b002082275_0271"/>
in Walsall, and all the energies of Sister Dora were <lb/>
called into play. She visited the cottages where the <reg orig="pa-|tients">patients</reg> <lb/>
lay, and nursed them or saw to their being supplied <lb/>
with what they needed; whilst at the same time carrying <lb/>
on her usual work at the hospital.</p>
<p>One night she was sent for by a poor man who was <lb/>
dying of what she called "black-pox," a violent form <lb/>
of small-pox. She went at once, and found him in the <lb/>
last extremity. All his relations had fled, and a <reg orig="neigh-|bour">neighbour</reg> <lb/>
alone was with him. When Sister Dora found that <lb/>
only one small piece of candle was left in the house,she <lb/>
gave the woman some money, begging her to go and buy <lb/>
some means of light whilst she stayed with the man. <lb/>
She sat on by his bed, but the woman, who had probably <lb/>
spent the money at the public house, never returned; <lb/>
and after some little while the dying man raised <reg orig="him-|self">himself</reg> <lb/>
up in bed with a last effort, saying, "Sister, kiss <lb/>
me before I die." She took him, all covered as he was <lb/>
with the loathsome disease, into her arms and kissed <lb/>
him, the candle going out almost as she did so, leaving <lb/>
them in total darkness. He implored her not to leave <lb/>
him while he lived, although he might have known she <lb/>
would never do that. So she sat through the night, <lb/>
till the early dawn breaking in revealed that the man <lb/>
was dead.</p>
<p>When the bell at the head of her bed rang at night <lb/>
she rose at once, saying to herself, "The Master is come, <lb/>
and calleth for thee!" Indeed, she loved to think that <lb/>
she was ministering to her Lord in the person of His <lb/>
poor and sick.</p>
<p>Here is a letter from a former patient in the hospital, <lb/>
from which only a short extract can be made:</p>
<p>"I had not been there above a week when Sister <lb/>
<pb n="247" entity="b002082275_0272"/>
Dora found me a little bell, as there was not one to my <lb/>
bed, and she said, 'Enoch, you must ring this bell when <lb/>
you want sister.' This little bell did not have much <lb/>
rest, for whenever I heard her step or the tinkle of her <lb/>
keys in the hall I used to ring my bell, and she would <lb/>
call out, 'I'm coming, Enoch,' which she did, and <lb/>
would say, 'What do you want?' I often used to say, <lb/>
'I don't know, Sister," not really knowing what I did <lb/>
want. She'd say, 'Do you want your pillows shaken <lb/>
up, or do you want moving a little?' which she'd do, <lb/>
whatever it was, and say, 'Do you feel quite cosey now?' <lb/>
'Yes, Sister.' Then she would start to go into the other <lb/>
ward, but very often before she could get through the <lb/>
door I'd call her back and say my pillow was n't quite <lb/>
right, or that my leg wanted moving a little. She would <lb/>
come and do it, whatever it was, and say, 'Will that do?' <lb/>
'Yes, Sister.' Then she'd go about her work, but at <lb/>
the very next sound of her step my bell would ring, and <lb/>
so often as my bell rang Sister would come; and some of <lb/>
the other patients would often remark that I should <lb/>
wear that little bell out or Sister, and she'd say, 'Never <lb/>
mind, for I like to hear it, and it's never too often.' <lb/>
And it rang so often that I've heard Sister say that she <lb/>
often dreamt she heard my little bell and started up in a <lb/>
hurry to find it was a dream."</p>
<p>Sister Dora said once to a friend, who was engaging <lb/>
a servant for the hospital:</p>
<p>"Tell her this is not an ordinary house, or even a <lb/>
hospital. I want her to understand that all who serve <lb/>
here, in whatever capacity, ought to have one rule, <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">love for God,</hi> and then, I need not say, love for their work."</p>
<p>She spoke often and with intense earnestness, on the <lb/>
duty, the necessity, of prayer. It was literally true <lb/>
<pb n="248" entity="b002082275_0273"/>
that she never touched a wound without raising her heart <lb/>
to God and entreating him to bless the means employed <lb/>
As years glided away, she became able almost to fulfil <lb/>
the Apostle's command: "Pray without ceasing." And <lb/>
her prayers were animated by the most intense faith &mdash; <lb/>
an absolutely unshaken conviction of their efficacy. It <lb/>
may truly be said that those who pray become <reg orig="increas-|ingly">increasingly</reg> <lb/>
more sure of the value of prayer. They find that, <lb/>
whatever men may say about the reign of law and the <lb/>
order of nature, earnest prayer does bring an answer, <lb/>
often in a marvellous manner. The praying man or <lb/>
woman is never shaken in his or her trust in the efficacy <lb/>
of prayer. She firmly held to the supernatural power, <lb/>
put into the hands of men by means of the weapon of <lb/>
prayer; and the practical faithlessness in this respect <lb/>
of the world at large was an ever-increasing source of <lb/>
surprise and distress to her.</p>
<p>Since her death, in commemoration of her labours at <lb/>
Walsall, a very beautiful statue has been there erected <lb/>
to her, and on the pedestal are bas-reliefs representing <lb/>
incidents in her life there. One of these illustrates a <lb/>
terrible explosion that took place in the Birchett's Iron <lb/>
Works, on Friday, October 15, 1875, whereby eleven <lb/>
men were so severely burnt that only two survived. All <lb/>
the others died after their admission into the hospital. <lb/>
It came about thus: The men were at work when water <lb/>
escaped from the "twyer" and fell upon the molten <lb/>
iron in the furnace and was at once resolved into steam <lb/>
that blew out the front of the furnace, and also the <lb/>
molten iron, which fell upon the men. Some suffered <lb/>
frightful agonies, but the shock to the nervous systems <lb/>
of others had stupefied them. The sight and the smell <lb/>
were terrible. Ladies who volunteered their help could <lb/>
<pb n="249" entity="b002082275_0274"/>
not endure it, and were forced to withdraw, some not <lb/>
getting beyond the door of the ward. But Sister Dora <lb/>
was with the patients incessantly till they died, giving <lb/>
them water, bandaging their wounds, or cutting away <lb/>
the sodden clothes that adhered to the burnt flesh. Some <lb/>
lingered on for ten days, but in all this time she never <lb/>
deserted the fetid atmosphere of the ward, never went <lb/>
to bed.</p>
<p>She had so much to do with burns that she became <lb/>
specially skilful in treating them. Children terribly <lb/>
burnt or scalded were constantly brought to the hospital; <lb/>
often men came scalded from a boiler, or by molten <lb/>
metal. She dressed their wounds herself, but, if <reg orig="possi-|ble">possible</reg>, <lb/>
always sent the patients to be tended at home, where <lb/>
she would visit them and regularly dress their wounds, <lb/>
rather than have the wards tainted by the effluvium from <lb/>
the burns. Her treatment of burnt children merits <lb/>
quotation.</p>
<p>"If a large surface of the body was burnt, or if the <lb/>
child seemed beside itself with terror, she did not touch <lb/>
the wounds themselves, but only carefully excluded the <lb/>
air from them by means of cotton wool and blankets <lb/>
wrapped around the body. She put hot bottles and <lb/>
flannel to the feet, and, if necessary, ice to the head. <lb/>
Then she gave her attention to soothing and consoling <lb/>
the shocked nerves&mdash;a state which she considered to <lb/>
be often a more immediate source of danger to the life <lb/>
of the child than the actual injuries. She fed it with <lb/>
milk and brandy, unless it violently refused food, when <lb/>
she would let it alone until it came round, saying that <lb/>
force, or anything which involved even a slight further <lb/>
shock to the system, was worse than useless. Sometimes, <lb/>
of course, the fatal sleep of exhaustion, from which <lb/>
<pb n="250" entity="b002082275_0275"/>
there was no awakening, would follow; but more often <lb/>
than not food was successfully administered, and afer <lb/>
a few hours, Sister Dora, having gained the child's <reg orig="con-|fidence">confidence</reg>, <lb/>
could dress the wounds without fear of exciting <lb/>
the frantic terror which would have been the result of <lb/>
touching them at first."</p>
<p>Children Sister Dora dearly loved; her heart went <lb/>
out to them with infinite tenderness, and she was even <lb/>
known to sleep with a burnt baby on each arm. What <lb/>
that means only those know who have had experience <lb/>
of the sickening smell arising from burns.</p>
<p>Once a little girl of nine was brought into the hospital <lb/>
so badly burnt that it was obvious she had not many <lb/>
hours to live. Sister Dora sat by her bed talking to her <lb/>
of Jesus Christ and His love for little children, and <lb/>
of the blessed home into which he would receive them. <lb/>
The child died peacefully, and her last words were: <lb/>
"Sister, when you come to heaven, I'll meet you at the <lb/>
gates with a bunch of flowers."</p>
<p>One of the most heroic of her many heroic acts was <lb/>
taking charge of the small-pox hospital when a second <lb/>
epidemic broke out.</p>
<p>Mr. S. Welsh says: "In the spring of 1875 there was <lb/>
a second visitation of the disease, and fears were <lb/>
entertained that the results would be as bad as during <lb/>
the former visitation. One morning Sister Dora came <lb/>
to me and said, 'Do you know, I have an idea that if <lb/>
some one could be got to go to the epidemic hospital <lb/>
in whom the people have confidence, they would send <lb/>
their friends to be nursed, the patients would be isolated, <lb/>
and the disease stamped out.'" This was because a <lb/>
prejudice was entertained against the new small-pox <lb/>
hospital, and those who had sick concealed the fact <lb/>
<pb n="251" entity="b002082275_0276"/>
rather than send them to it. "I said," continues Mr. <lb/>
Welsh, "'I have long been of the opinion you have just <lb/>
expressed; but where are we to get a lady, in whom the <lb/>
people would have confidence, to undertake the duty?'</p>
<p>"Her prompt reply was, 'I will go.'</p>
<p>"I confess the sudden announcement of her <reg orig="deter-|mination">determination</reg> <lb/>
rather took me by surprise, for I had no <reg orig="expec-|tation">expectation</reg> <lb/>
of it, and not the least remote idea that she intended <lb/>
to go. 'But,' I said, 'who will take charge of the <lb/>
hospital if you go there?'</p>
<p>"'Oh,' she replied, 'I can get plenty of ladies to come <lb/>
there, but none will go to the epidemic. And,' she <lb/>
added, by way of reconciling me to her view, 'it will only <lb/>
be for a short time.'</p>
<p>"'But what if you were to take the disease and die?' <lb/>
I inquired.</p>
<p>"'Then,' she added, in her cheery way, 'I shall have <lb/>
died in the path of duty, and, you know, I could not die <lb/>
better.'</p>
<p>"I knew it was no use pointing out at length the risk <lb/>
she ran, for where it was a case of saving others, <hi rend="italic">self</hi> <lb/>
with her was no consideration. I tried to dissuade her <lb/>
on other grounds. &hellip; A few days later I was in <lb/>
company with the doctor of the hospital, who was also <lb/>
medical officer of health, and who, as such, had charge <lb/>
of the epidemic hospital, near to which we were at the <lb/>
time. He said, 'Do you know where Sister Dora is?' <lb/>
'At the hospital I suppose,' was my reply. 'No,' he <lb/>
rejoined, 'she is over there!' pointing to the epidemic <lb/>
hospital. &hellip;</p>
<p>"The people as soon as they knew Sister Dora was <lb/>
in charge, had no misgiving about sending their relatives <lb/>
to be nursed, and the result was as she had predicted; the <lb/>
<pb n="252" entity="b002082275_0277"/>
cases were brought in as soon as it was discovered that <lb/>
patients had the disease, and the epidemic was speedily <lb/>
stamped out."</p>
<p>She had, however, a hard time of it there, as she lacked <lb/>
assistants. Two women were sent from the work-house, <lb/>
but they proved of little use. The porter, an old soldier, <lb/>
was attentive and kind in his way, but he always <lb/>
went out "on a spree" on Saturday nights, and did not <lb/>
return till late on Sunday evening. When the <reg orig="work-|house">work-house</reg> <lb/>
women failed her she was sometimes alone with <lb/>
her patients, and these occasionally in the delirium of <lb/>
small-pox.</p>
<p>It was not till the middle of August, 1875, that the <lb/>
last small-pox patient departed from the hospital, and <lb/>
she was able to return to her original work.</p>
<p>One of the bas-reliefs on her monument represents <lb/>
Sister Dora consoling the afflicted and the scene depicted <lb/>
refers to a dreadful colliery accident that occurred on <lb/>
March 14, 1872, at Pelsall, a village rather over three <lb/>
miles from Walsall, by which twenty-two men were <lb/>
entombed, and all perished. For several days hopes <lb/>
were entertained that some of the men would be got <lb/>
out alive; and blankets in which to wrap them, and <reg orig="res-|toratives">restoratives</reg>, <lb/>
were provided, and Sister Dora was sent for <lb/>
to attend the men when brought to "bank." The <reg orig="follow-|ing">following</reg> <lb/>
extract, from an article by a special correspondent <lb/>
in a newspaper, dated Dec 10, 1872, will give some idea <lb/>
of Sister Dora's connection with the event: <lb/>
<q>Out of doors the scene is weird and awful, and impresses the <lb/>
mind with a peculiar gloom; for the intensity of the darkness <lb/>
is heightened by the shades created by the artificial lights. Every <lb/>
object, the most minute, stands out in bold relief against the inky <lb/>
darkness which surrounds the landscape. On the crest of the <lb/>
mound or pit-bank, the policemen, like sentinels, are walking <lb/>
<pb n="253" entity="b002082275_0278"/>
their rounds. The wind is howling and whistling through the <lb/>
trees which form a background to the pit-bank, and the rain is <lb/>
coming hissing down in sheets. In a hovel close to the pit shaft <lb/>
sit the bereaved and disconsolate mourners, hoping against hope, <lb/>
and watching for those who will never return. There, too, are <lb/>
the swarthy sons of toil who have just returned from their <reg orig="fruit-|less">fruitless</reg> <lb/>
search in the mine for the dear missing ones, and are resting <lb/>
while their saturated clothes are drying.</q>
<q>But another form glides softly from that hovel; and amid the <lb/>
pelting rain, and over the rough pit-bank, and through miry <lb/>
clay&mdash;now ankle deep&mdash;takes her course to the dwellings of <lb/>
the mourners, for some, spent with watching, have been induced <lb/>
to return to their homes. As she plods her way amid pieces of <lb/>
timber, upturned wagons and fragments of broken machinery, <lb/>
which are scattered about in great confusion, a "wee, wee bairn" <lb/>
creeps gently to her side, and grasping her hand and looking <lb/>
wistfully into her face, which is radiant with kindness and <reg orig="affec-|tion">affection</reg>, <lb/>
says, "Oh, Sister, do see to my father when they bring him <lb/>
up the pit." Poor child! Never again would he know a father's <lb/>
love, or share a father's care. She smiled, and that smile seemed <lb/>
to lighten the child's load of grief, and her promise to see to his <lb/>
father appeared to impart consolation to his heavy, despairing <lb/>
heart.</q>
<q>On she glides, with a kind word or a sympathetic expression <lb/>
to all. One woman, after listening to her comforting words, <lb/>
burst into tears&mdash;the fountains of sorrow so long pent up seemed <lb/>
to have found vent. "Let her weep," said a relative of the <reg orig="un-|fortunate">unfortunate</reg> <lb/>
woman; "it is the first tear she has shed since the <reg orig="acci-|dent">accident</reg> <lb/>
has occurred, and it will do her good to cry." But who <lb/>
is the good Samaritan? She is the sister who for seven years <lb/>
has had the management of the nursing department in the <reg orig="cot-|tage">cottage</reg> <lb/>
hospital at Walsall.</q></p>
<p>This is written in too much of the "special <reg orig="corre-|spondent">correspondent</reg>" <lb/>
style to be pleasant; nevertheless it describes <lb/>
what actually took place.</p>
<p>Mr. Samuel Welsh says: "I remember one evening <lb/>
I was in the hospital when a poor man who had been <lb/>
dreadfully crushed in a pit was brought in. One of his <lb/>
<pb n="254" entity="b002082275_0279"/>
legs was so fearfully injured that it was thought it would <lb/>
be necessary to amputate it. After examining the <reg orig="pa-|tient">patient</reg>, <lb/>
the doctor came to me in the committee-room &mdash; <lb/>
one door of which opened into the passage leading to the <lb/>
wards and another into the hall in the domestic portion <lb/>
of the building. After telling me about the patient <lb/>
who had just been brought in, he said, 'Do you know <lb/>
Sister Dora is very ill? So ill,' he continued, 'that I <lb/>
question if she will pull through this time.' I naturally <lb/>
inquired what whe was suffering from, and in reply the <lb/>
doctor said, 'She will not take care of herself, and is <lb/>
suffering from blood-poison.' He left me, and I was <lb/>
just trying to solve the problem &mdash;'What shall be done? <lb/>
or how shall her place be supplied if she be taken from <lb/>
us by death?' when I saw a spectral-like figure gliding <lb/>
gently and almost noiselessly through the room from <lb/>
the domestic entrance to the door leading to the wards. <lb/>
The figure was rather indistinct,for it was nearly dark <lb/>
and as I gazed at the receding form, I said, 'Sister, is it <lb/>
you?' 'Whist! she said, and glided through the <reg orig="door-|way">doorway</reg> <lb/>
into the wards. In a short time she returned, and <lb/>
I said to her, 'Sister, the doctor has just been telling <lb/>
me how ill you are &mdash; how is it you are here?' 'Ah!' <lb/>
replied, she 'it is true I am very ill; but I heard the <reg orig="sur-|geons">surgeons</reg> <lb/>
talking about amputating that poor fellow's limb, <lb/>
and I wanted to see whether or not there was a <reg orig="possi-|bility">possibility</reg> <lb/>
of saving it, and I believe there is; and, knowing <lb/>
that, I shall rest better.' So saying, she glided as <reg orig="noise-|lessly">noiselessly</reg> <lb/>
out of the room as when she entered.</p>
<p>"On her recovery &mdash; which was retarded by her <reg orig="neglect-|ing">neglecting</reg> <lb/>
herself to attend to others &mdash; she called me one day to <lb/>
the hall-door of the hospital, and asked me if I thought <lb/>
it was going to rain. I told her I did not think it would <lb/>
<pb n="255" entity="b002082275_0280"/>
rain for some hours. She then told me to go and order <lb/>
a cab to be ready at the hospital in half an hour. I <lb/>
tried to persuade her not to venture out so soon; but it <lb/>
was no use &mdash; she went; and many a time I wondered <lb/>
where she went to.</p>
<p>"About six months afterward I happened to be at a <lb/>
railway station, and saw a pointsman who had been in <lb/>
our hospital with an injured foot, but who, as his friends <lb/>
wished to have him at home, had left before his foot <lb/>
was cured. I inquired how his foot was. He replied <lb/>
that had it not been for Sister Dora he would have lost <lb/>
his foot, if not his life. I said, 'How did she save your <lb/>
foot when you were not in the hospital, and she was ill <lb/>
at the time you left the hospital?' 'Well,' he replied, <lb/>
'you know my foot was far from well when I left the <lb/>
hostital; there was no one at our house who could see <lb/>
to it properly, and it took bad ways, and one evening I <lb/>
was in awful pain. Oh, how I did wish for Sister Dora <lb/>
to come and dress it! I felt sure she could give me <lb/>
relief, but I had been told she was very ill, so I had no <lb/>
hope that my earnest desire would be realised; but while <lb/>
I was thinking and wishing, the bedroom door was gently <lb/>
opened, and a figure just like Sister Dora glided so <lb/>
softly into the room that I could not hear her, but oh! <lb/>
she was so pale that I began to think it must be her spirit <lb/>
but when she folded the bedclothes from off my foot, <lb/>
I knew it was she. She dressed my foot, and from that <lb/>
hour it began to improve.'</p>
<p>"A few days after this interview with the pointsman <lb/>
I was talking to Sister Dora, and said: 'By the bye, Sister, <lb/>
I have found out where you went with the cab that day.' <lb/>
She replied with a merry twinkle in her eye, 'What a <lb/>
long time you have been finding it out!'"</p>
<pb n="256" entity="b002082275_0281"/>
<p>Her old patients ever remembered her with gratitude. <lb/>
A man called Chell, and engine-stoker, was twice in the <lb/>
hospital under her care, first with a dislocated ankle, <lb/>
severely cut; the second time with a leg crushed to <lb/>
pieces in a railway accident. It was amputated. <reg orig="Ac-|cording">According</reg> <lb/>
to his own account he remembered nothing of <lb/>
the operation, except that Sister Dora was there, and <lb/>
that, "When I come to after the chloroform, she was on <lb/>
her knees by my side with her arm supporting my head, <lb/>
and she was repeating: <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"'They climbed the steep ascent of heaven,</l>
<l rend="indent">Through peril, toil and pain:</l>
<l>O God, to us may grace be given</l>
<l rend="indent">To follow in their train.'</l>
</lg></q>
And all through the pain and trouble that I had <reg orig="after-|ward">afterward</reg>, <lb/>
I never forgot Sister's voice saying those words." <lb/>
When she was in the small-pox hospital, avoided <lb/>
by most, this man never failed to stump away to it to <lb/>
see her and inquire how she was getting on.</p>
<p>There were, as she herself recognised, faults in the <lb/>
character of Sister Dora; and yet, without these faults, <lb/>
problematical as it may seem, it is doubtful whether she <lb/>
could have achieved all she did.</p>
<p>One who knew her long and intimately writes to me <lb/>
"A majestic character, brimming over with sympathy, <lb/>
but, for lack of self-discipline, this sympathy was <reg orig="impuls-|ive">impulsive</reg> <lb/>
and gushing. Her glorious nature, physical and <lb/>
mental, was marred by undisciplined impulse. Her <lb/>
nature found its congenial outlet in devoted works of <lb/>
mercy and love to her fellow creatures. How far she <lb/>
would have done the same under authority, I fear is a <lb/>
little doubtful."</p>
<p>Miss Twigg, who knew her well, writes me: "She was <lb/>
<pb n="257" entity="b002082275_0282"/>
a lovable woman, so bright and winsome. She used to <lb/>
come into our rather dull and sad home &lpar;our mother died <lb/>
when we were quite children&rpar; after evening service. She <lb/>
would nurse one of us, big as we were then, and the <lb/>
others would gather round her, while she would tell us <lb/>
stories of her hospital life. &hellip; She was a <hi rend="italic">real</hi> <lb/>
woman."</p>
<p>There is one point in Sister Dora's life to which <lb/>
sufficient attention has not been paid by her biographers. <lb/>
It is one which the busy workers of the present day think <lb/>
of too little&mdash;namely, the writing of bright, helpful letters <lb/>
to any friend who is sick or in trouble. Somehow or <lb/>
other she always found time for that, wrote one who <lb/>
knew her well, and who contributes the following, written <lb/>
to a young girl who was at the time in a spinal hospital, <lb/>
and who was almost a stranger to her:</p>
<q><text id="d28"><body><div1 type="quotation">
<p><hi rend="small-caps">My dear Miss J.</hi>&mdash;I was so glad to hear from you, though <lb/>
I fear it must be a trouble for you to write. I <hi rend="italic">do</hi> hope that you <lb/>
will really have benefited by the treatment and rest. I am so <lb/>
glad that the doctor is good to his "children." Such little <reg orig="atten-|tions">attentions</reg> <lb/>
when you are sick help to alleviate wonderfully. I wish <lb/>
I could come and take a peep at you. Did Mrs. N. tell you that <lb/>
she had sent us five pounds for our seaside expedition? Was <lb/>
it not good of her? Oh! we shall have such a jolly time. To see all <lb/>
those poor creatures drink in the sea-breezes! We have had a <lb/>
very busy week of accidents and operations. It has been a <reg orig="regu-|lar">regular</reg> <lb/>

 My dear, it is in such times as you are now having <lb/>

<pb n="258" entity="b002082275_0283"/>
of the cheering lines of our hymn: "His touch has still its ancient <lb/>

over this when a good friend came to me, and told me only <lb/>
to take a day's burden and not look forward, and it was such a <lb/>

and grace for the day's trial. May it be said of you, dear, "They <lb/>

<p>It does not truly represent Sister Dora to dwell on her <lb/>
outer life, and not look as well into that which is within, <lb/>
as it was the very mainspring of all her actions, as it, <lb/>
in fact, made her what she was.</p>
<p>The same writer to the <hi rend="italic">Guardian</hi> gives some sentences <lb/>
from other letters: "Take your cross day by day, <lb/>
dearie, and with Jesus Christ bearing the other end it <lb/>
will not be <hi rend="italic">too</hi> heavy." "If we could find Jesus, it must <lb/>
be on a mountain, not in the plains or smooth places." <lb/>
"He went up into a mountain and taught them, saying," <lb/>
etc. "It is only on a mountain side that we shall see the <lb/>
cross. It was only after Zacch&aelig;us had <hi rend="italic">climbed</hi> the tree <lb/>
he could see Jesus. I have been thinking much of this <lb/>
lately. It is not in the smooth places we shall see Jesus, <lb/>
it is in the rough, in the storm, or by the sick couch." <lb/>
"A Christian is one whose object is Christ." "I am <lb/>
rejoiced that you are enjoying Faber's hymns; they always <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">warm</hi> me up. Oh, my dear, is it not sad that we prefer <lb/>
to live in the shade when we might have the glorious <lb/>
sunshine?"</p>
<p>It was during the winter of 1876-77 that Sister Dora <lb/>
felt the first approach of the terrible disease that was <lb/>
to cause her death, and then it was rather by diminution <lb/>
<pb n="259" entity="b002082275_0284"/>
of strength than by actual pain. She consulted a doctor <lb/>
in Birmingham, in whom she placed confidence, and <lb/>
he told her the plain truth, that her days in this world <lb/>
were numbered. She exacted from him a pledge of <lb/>
secrecy, and then went on with her work as hitherto.</p>
<p>"She was suddenly brought, as it were, face to face <lb/>
with death &mdash; distant, perhaps, but inevitable; she, who <lb/>
was full of such exuberant life and spirit that the very <lb/>
word 'death' seemed a contradiction when applied to <lb/>
her. Even her doctor, as he looked at her blooming <lb/>
appearance, and measured with his eye her finely made <lb/>
form, was almost inclined to believe the evidence of his <lb/>
outward senses against his sober judgment. &hellip; <lb/>
She could not endure pity. She, to whom everybody <lb/>
had learnt instinctively to turn for help and consolation, <lb/>
on whom others leant for support, must she now come <lb/>
down to ask of them sympathy and comfort? The pride <lb/>
of life was still surging up in her, that pride which had <lb/>
made her glory in her physical strength for its own sake, <lb/>
as well as for its manifold uses in the service of her <lb/>
Master. True, she had been long living two lives <reg orig="in-|separably">inseparably</reg> <lb/>
blended: the outward life of hard, unceasing <lb/>
toil; the inner, a constant communion with the unseen <lb/>
world, the existence of which she realised to an extent <lb/>
which not even those who saw the most of her could <lb/>
appreciate. To all the poor, ignorant beings whose <lb/>
souls she tried to reach by means of their maimed bodies, <lb/>
she was, indeed, the personification of all that they could <lb/>
conceive as lovable, holy and merciful in the Saviour. <lb/>
At the same time she judged her own self with strict <reg orig="im-|partiality">impartiality</reg>. <lb/>
She knew her own faults, her unbending <lb/>
will&mdash;her pride and glory in her work seemed to her even <lb/>
<unclear id="u17">a fault;</unclear> and, in place of looking on herself as perfect <lb/>
<pb n="260" entity="b002082275_0285"/>
she was bowed down with a sense of her own <reg orig="short-|comings">shortcomings</reg>. <lb/>
At the same time &mdash; with death before her, <lb/>
she hungered for more work for her Master. His words <lb/>
were continually on her lips: 'I must work the works <lb/>
of Him that sent me while it is day; the night cometh <lb/>
when no man can work.'"</p>
<p>At last, in the month of August, 1878, typhoid fever <lb/>
having broken out in the temporary hospital, it was <lb/>
found necessary to close it, and hasten on the work of <lb/>
the construction of another. This gave her an <reg orig="oppor-|tunity">opportunity</reg> <lb/>
for a holiday and a complete change. She went <lb/>
to the Isle of Man, to London, and to Paris.</p>
<p>But the disorder was making rapid strides, and was <lb/>
causing her intense suffering, and she craved to be back <lb/>
at Walsall. She got as far as Birmingham, and was <lb/>
then in such a critical state that it was feared she would <lb/>
die. But her earnest entreaty was to be taken to <reg orig="Wal-|sall">Walsall</reg>. <lb/>
"Let me die," she pleaded, "among my own <lb/>
people."</p>
<p>Mr. Welsh says: "On calling at the Queen's Hotel, <lb/>
Birmingham &lpar;where she was lying ill&rpar;, I was told the <lb/>
doctor of the hospital &lpar;Dr. Maclachlan&rpar; was with her, <lb/>
and thinking they were probably arranging matters <reg orig="con-|nected">connected</reg> <lb/>
with the hospital, I did not go to her room, but <lb/>
proceeded to the train. I had scarcely got seated when <lb/>
the doctor called me out, and we entered a compartment <lb/>
where we were alone. He asked me when it was intended <lb/>
to open the hospital. I replied, 'On the 4th of <reg orig="Novem-|ber">November</reg>.' <lb/>
'Then,' he said, 'that will just be about the same <lb/>
time Sister Dora will die.'</p>
<p>"The announcement was to me a shock of no ordinary <lb/>
kind, for I had not heard of her being ill, and no one <lb/>
could have imagined, from the cheerful tone of a letter <lb/>
<pb n="261" entity="b002082275_0286"/>
I had received from her a week or so before, that there <lb/>
was anything the matter with her. Not being able to <lb/>
fully realise the true state of affairs, I asked him if he <lb/>
were jesting. He replied he was not, and that he thought <lb/>
it best to let me know at once, so that arrangements <lb/>
might be made for getting someone to take her place <lb/>
when the hospital was opened. I said, 'I suppose she <lb/>
is going to Yorkshire?' 'No,' he replied, 'and that is <lb/>
another thing I wish to speak to you about. She wishes <lb/>
to die in Walsall, and she must be removed immediately.'</p>
<p>"On Sunday &lpar;the day following&rpar; I saw the chairman <lb/>
and vice-chairman of the hospital. On Sunday <reg orig="even-|ing">evening</reg> <lb/>
I returned with Dr. Maclachlan to the Queen's <lb/>
Hotel, where he found his patient very weak. On <reg orig="Mon-|day">Monday</reg> <lb/>
morning a house was taken, and the furniture she <lb/>
had in her rooms at the hospital removed to it. Her old <lb/>
servant who had gone to The Potteries, was telegraphed <lb/>
for, and arrived in a few hours, and by midday the <lb/>
house was ready for her reception. My daughter, <reg orig="know-|ing">knowing</reg> <lb/>
Sister Dora's fondness for flowers, had procured and <lb/>
placed on the table in the parlour a very choice bouquet; <lb/>
and when all was ready Dr. Maclachlan drove over to <lb/>
Birmingham, and brought her to Walsall in his private <lb/>
carriage.</p>
<p>"The disease was now making steady progress, and <lb/>
it was evident that every day she was becoming weaker; <lb/>
but she never lost her cheerfulness, and anyone to have <lb/>
seen her might have thought she was only suffering <lb/>
from some slight ailment, instead of an incurable and <lb/>
painful disease."</p>
<p>"A few hours before her death," writes Mr. S. Welsh <lb/>
"she called me to her bedside and said, 'I want you to <lb/>
promise that you will not, when I am gone, write <reg orig="any-|thing">anything</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="262" entity="b002082275_0287"/>
about me; <hi rend="italic">quietly I came among you and, quietly <lb/>
I wish to go away.'"</hi> And this desire of hers would <lb/>
have been faithfully complied with had not <reg orig="misrepresen-|tations">misrepresentations</reg> <lb/>
fired the gentleman to whom the request was <lb/>
made to take up his pen, not in defence of her, but in <lb/>
the correction of statements that affected certain persons <lb/>
who were alive.</p>
<p>In her last sickness when she found her end <reg orig="approach-|ing">approaching</reg>, <lb/>
she insisted on every one leaving the room &mdash; it was <lb/>
her wish to die alone. And as she persisted, so was it, <lb/>
only one nurse standing by the door held a jar, and <reg orig="watch-|ing">watching</reg> <lb/>
till she knew by the change of attitude, and a certain <lb/>
fixed look in the countenance, that Sister Dora had <lb/>
entered into her rest.<ref target="n2" n="2">*</ref>
<note id="n2" place="foot" n="2"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>This has been denied. Her old and devoted servant said: "Do you think <lb/>
I would let my darling die alone?" But it appears to me that Sister Dora's <reg orig="de-|sire">desire</reg> <lb/>
was one to be expected in such a spiritual nature; and in the statement <lb/>
above given it is not said that she was actually left in solitude.</p></note>
</p>
<p>"It was Christmas Eve when she passed away, and <lb/>
a dense fog, like a funeral pall, hung over the town <lb/>
and obscured every object a few feet from the ground. <lb/>
Under this strange canopy the market was being held, <lb/>
and people were busy buying and selling, and making <lb/>
preparations for the great Christmas festival on the <lb/>
following day; but when the deep boom of the passing <lb/>
bell announced the melancholy intelligence that Sister <lb/>
Dora had entered into her rest, a thrill of horror ran <lb/>
through the people, who, with blanched cheeks and <lb/>
bated breath, whispered, 'Can it be true?' Although <lb/>
for seven weeks the process of dissolution had been <lb/>
going on before their eyes, they could not realise the <lb/>
fact that she whom they loved and revered was no <lb/>
more."</p>
<p>The funeral took place on Saturday, the 28th of <lb/>
<pb n="263" entity="b002082275_0288"/>
December. "The day was dark and dismal, the streets, <lb/>
covered with slush and sludge caused by the melted <lb/>
snow, were thronged with spectators. &hellip; There <lb/>
was general mourning in the town; and although it was <lb/>
market day nearly every shop was closed during the <lb/>
time of the funeral, and all the blinds along the route of <lb/>
the procession were drawn. &hellip; On reaching the <lb/>
cemetery it was found that four other funerals had <lb/>
arrived from the workhouse; and as these coffins had <lb/>
been taken into the chapel there was no room for Sister <lb/>
Dora's, which had, consequently, to be placed in the <lb/>
porch. This was as Sister Dora would have wished, <lb/>
had she had the ordering of the arrangements, for she <lb/>
always gave preference to the poor, to whom she was <lb/>
attached in life, and from whom she would not have <lb/>
desired to be separated in death."</p>
<p>True to her thought of others, in the midst of her last <lb/>
sufferings, she had made arrangements for a Christmas <lb/>
dinner to be given to a number of her old patients, in <lb/>
accordance with a custom of hers in previous years; <lb/>
but on this occasion the festive proceedings were shorn <lb/>
of their gladness. All thought of her who in her pain <lb/>
and on her deathbed had thought of them. Every one <lb/>
tried, but ineffectually, to cheer and comfort the other, <lb/>
but the task was hopeless. One young lady, after the <lb/>
meal, and while the Christmas tree was being lighted <lb/>
commenced singing the pretty little piece, "Far Away," <lb/>
but when she came to the words: <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>Some are gone from us forever</l>
<l>Longer here they could not stay,</l>
</lg></q>
she burst into tears; and the women present sobbed, and <lb/>
tears were seen stealing down the cheeks of bearded men.</p>
<pb n="264" entity="b002082275_0289"/>
<p>The Walsall writer of "A Review" concludes his paper <lb/>
thus: <lb/>
<q>She is no idol to us, but we worship her memory as the most <lb/>
saintly thing that was ever given us. Her name is immortalised, <lb/>
both by her own surpassing goodness, and by the love of a whole <lb/>
people for her&mdash;a love that will survive through generations, <lb/>
and give a magic and a music to those simple words, "Sister <lb/>
Dora," long after we shall have passed away. There was little <lb/>
we could ever do&mdash;there was nothing she would let us do&mdash;to <lb/>
relieve the self-imposed rigours of her life; but we love her in all <lb/>
sincerity, and now in our helplessness we find a serene joy in <lb/>
the knowledge that to her, as surely as to any human soul, will <lb/>
be spoken the divine words: "Inasmuch as ye have done it <lb/>
unto the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto Me."</q></p>
<p>In Sister Dora, surely we have the highest type of the <lb/>
Christian life, the inner and hidden life of the soul, <lb/>
the life that is hid in God, combined with that outer life <lb/>
devoted to the doing of good to suffering and needy <lb/>
humanity. In the cloistered nun we see only the first, <lb/>
and that tends to become self-centred and morbid; <lb/>
it is redeemed from this vice by an active life of <reg orig="self-|sacrifice">self-sacrifice</reg>.</p>
<p>I cannot do better than, in conclusion, quote from the <lb/>
last letter ever penned by Sister Dora:</p>
<p>"It is 2.30 A.M., and I cannot sleep, so I am going <lb/>
to write to you. I was anything but 'forbearing,' dear; <lb/>
I was overbearing, and I am truly sorry for it now. I <lb/>
look back on my life and see 'nothing but leaves.' Oh, <lb/>
my darling, let me speak to you from my deathbed, <lb/>
and say, watch in all you do that you have a single aim <lb/>
&mdash; <hi rend="italic">God's</hi> honour and glory. 'I came not to work my <lb/>
own work, but the works of Him that sent me.' Look <lb/>
upon working as a privilege. Do not look upon nursing <lb/>
in the way they do so much nowadays, as an art or <lb/>
<pb n="265" entity="b002082275_0290"/>
science, but as work done for Christ. As you touch each <lb/>
patient, think it is Christ Himself, and then virtue will <lb/>
come out of the touch to yourself. I have felt that <lb/>
myself, when I have had a particularly loathsome <reg orig="pa-|tient">patient</reg>. <lb/>
Be full of the Glad Tidings, and you will tell <lb/>
others. You cannot give what you have not got."</p>

</epigraph>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Some</hi> years ago, when the celebrated Florence <lb/>
Nightingale was a little girl, living at her father's <lb/>
home, a large, old Elizabethan house, with great woods <lb/>
about it, in Hampshire, there was one thing that struck <lb/>
everybody who knew her. It was that she seemed to be <lb/>
always thinking what she could do to please or help <reg orig="any-|one">anyone</reg> <lb/>
who needed either help or comfort. She was very <lb/>
fond, too, of animals, and she was so gentle in her way, <lb/>
that even the shyest of them would come quite close to <lb/>
her, and pick up whatever she flung down for them to <lb/>
eat.</p>
<p>There was, in the garden behind the house, a long walk <lb/>
with trees on each side, the abode of many squirrels, <lb/>
and when Florence came down the walk, dropping nuts <lb/>
as she went along, the squirrels would run down the <lb/>
trunks of their trees, and, hardly waiting until she passed <lb/>
by, would pick up the prize and dart away, with their <lb/>
<pb n="267" entity="b002082275_0292"/>
little bushy tails curled over their backs, and their black <lb/>
eyes looking about as if terrified at the least noise, though <lb/>
they did not seem to be afraid of Florence.</p>
<p>Then there was an old gray pony named Peggy, past <lb/>
work, living in a paddock, with nothing to do all day long <lb/>
but to amuse herself. Whenever Florence appeared at <lb/>
the gate, Peggy would come trotting up and put her nose <lb/>
into the dress pocket of her little mistress, and pick it <lb/>
of the apple or the roll of bread that she knew she would <lb/>
always find there, for this was a trick Florence had <lb/>
taught the pony. Florence was fond of riding, and her <lb/>
father's old friend, the clergyman of the parish, used <lb/>
often to come and take her for a ride with him when he <lb/>
went to the farm cottages at a distance.</p>
<p>As he had studied medicine when a young man, he <lb/>
was able to tell the people what would do them good <lb/>
when they were ill or had met with an accident. Little <lb/>
Florence took great delight in helping to nurse those <lb/>
who were ill; and whenever she went on these long rides, <lb/>
she had a small basket fastened to her saddle, filled <lb/>
with something nice which she saved from her breakfast <lb/>
or dinner, or carried for her mother.</p>
<p>There lived in one of two or three solitary cottages <lb/>
in the wood an old shepherd of her father's, named <lb/>
Roger, who had a favourite sheep-dog called Cap. Roger <lb/>
had neither wife nor child, and Cap lived with him <lb/>
and kept him company at night after he had penned <lb/>
his flock. Cap was a very sensible dog; indeed people <lb/>
used to say he could do everything but speak. He kept <lb/>
the sheep in wonderfully good order, and thus saved his <lb/>
master a great deal of trouble. One day as Florence and <lb/>
her old friend were out for a ride, they came to a field <lb/>
where they found the shepherd giving his sheep their <lb/>
<pb n="268" entity="b002082275_0293"/>
night feed; but he was without the dog, and the sheep <lb/>
knew it, for they were scampering in every direction. <lb/>
Florence and her friend noticed that the old shepherd <lb/>
looked very sad, and they stopped to ask what was the <lb/>
matter, and what had become of his dog.</p>
<p>"Oh," said Roger, "Cap will never be of any more <lb/>
use to me; I'll have to hang him, poor fellow, as soon <lb/>
as I go home to-night."</p>
<p>"Hang him!" said Florence. "Oh, Roger, how wicked <lb/>
of you! What has dear old Cap done?"</p>
<p>"He has done nothing," replied Roger; "but he will <lb/>
never be of any more use to me, and I cannot afford <lb/>
to keep him for nothing; one of the mischievous school <lb/>
boys throwed a stone at him yesterday and broke one of <lb/>
his legs." And the old shepherd's eyes filled with tears, <lb/>
which he wiped away with his shirt-sleeve, then he drove <lb/>
his spade deep in the ground to hide what he felt, for he <lb/>
did not like to be seen crying.</p>
<p>"Poor Cap," he sighed, "he was as knowing almost <lb/>
as a human being."</p>
<p>"But are you sure his leg is broken?" asked Florence.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, miss, it is broken safe enough; he has not <lb/>
put his foot to the ground since."</p>
<p>Florence and her friend rode on without saying <reg orig="any-|thing">anything</reg> <lb/>
more to Roger.</p>
<p>"We will go and see poor Cap," said the vicar; "I <lb/>
don't believe the leg is really broken. It would take a <lb/>
big stone and a hard blow to break the leg of a big dog <lb/>
like Cap."</p>
<p>"Oh, if you could cure him, how glad Roger would <lb/>
be!" replied Florence.</p>
<p>They soon reached the shepherd's cottage, but the <lb/>
door has fastened; and when they moved the latch, such <lb/>
<pb n="269" entity="b002082275_0294"/>
a furious barking was heard that they drew back, startled. <lb/>
However, a little boy came out of the next cottage, and <lb/>
asked if they wanted to go in, as Roger had left the key <lb/>
with his mother. So the key was got and the door opened <lb/>
and there on the bare brick floor lay the dog, his hair <lb/>
dishevelled, and his eyes sparkling with anger at the <reg orig="in-|truders">intruders</reg>. <lb/>
But when he saw the little boy he grew <reg orig="peace-|ful">peaceful</reg>, <lb/>
and when he looked at Florence and heard her call <lb/>
him "poor Cap," he began to wag his short tail; and then <lb/>
crept from under the table and lay down at her feet. <lb/>
She took hold of one of his paws, patted his old rough <lb/>
head, and talked to him, whilst her friend examined <lb/>
the injured leg. It was dreadfully swollen, and hurt <lb/>
very much to have it examined; but the dog knew it <lb/>
was meant kindly, and though he moaned and winced <lb/>
with pain, he licked the hands that were hurting him.</p>
<p>"It's only a bad bruise, no bones are broken," said <lb/>
her old friend. "Rest is all Cap needs; he will soon be <lb/>
well again."</p>
<p>"I am so glad," said Florence; "but can we do nothing <lb/>
for him, he seems in such pain?"</p>
<p>"There is one thing that would ease the pain and <lb/>
heal the leg all the sooner, and that is plenty of hot water <lb/>
to foment the part."</p>
<p>Florence struck a light with the tinder-box, and lighted <lb/>
the fire, which was already laid. She then set off to the <lb/>
other cottage to get something to bathe the leg with. <lb/>
She found an old flannel petticoat hanging up to dry, <lb/>
and this she carried off, and tore up into strips, which <lb/>
she wrung out in warm water, and laid them tenderly on <lb/>
Cap's swollen leg. It was not long before the poor dog <lb/>
felt the benefit of the application, and he looked grateful, <lb/>
wagging his little stump of a tail in thanks. On their <lb/>
<pb n="270" entity="b002082275_0295"/>
way home they met the shepherd coming slowly along <lb/>
with a piece of rope in his hand.</p>
<p>"Oh, Roger," cried Florence, "you are not to hang <lb/>
poor old Cap; his leg is not broken at all."</p>
<p>"No, he will serve you yet," said the vicar.</p>
<p>"Well, I be main glad to hear it," said the shepherd, <lb/>
"and thanks to you for going to see him."</p>
<p>On the next morning Florence was up early, and the <lb/>
first thing she did was to take two flannel petticoats to <lb/>
give to the poor woman whose skirt she had torn up to <lb/>
bathe Cap. Then she went to the dog, and was delighted <lb/>
to find the swelling of his leg much less. She bathed it <lb/>
again, and Cap was as grateful as before.</p>
<p>Two or three days afterward Florence and her friend <lb/>
were riding together, when they came up to Roger and <lb/>
his sheep. This time Cap was watching the sheep, <lb/>
though he was lying quite still, and pretending to be <lb/>
asleep. When he heard the voice of Florence speaking <lb/>
to his master, who was portioning out the usual food, <lb/>
his tail wagged and his eyes sparkled, but he did not <lb/>
get up, for he was on duty. The shepherd stopped his <lb/>
work, and as he glanced at the dog with a merry laugh, <lb/>
said, "Do look at the dog, Miss; he be so pleased to hear <lb/>
your voice." Cap's tail went faster and faster. "I <lb/>
be glad," continued the old man, "I did not hang him. <lb/>
I be greatly obliged to you Miss, and the vicar, for what <lb/>
you did. But for you I would have hanged the best <lb/>
dog I ever had in my life."</p>
<p>This child, Florence Nightingale, of whom the <reg orig="fore-|going">foregoing</reg> <lb/>
story is told, was born in Florence, Italy, in 1820. <lb/>
Her parents were English, and her early years were given <lb/>
to the studies which a girl fortunately situated would <lb/>
follow. She was taught in science and mathematics as <lb/>
<pb n="271" entity="b002082275_0296"/>
well as in the fluent use of French, German and <lb/>
Italian.</p>
<p>But from the day the little girl nursed the leg of the <lb/>
shepherd's dog, it became the custom of the <reg orig="neighbour-|hood">neighbourhood</reg> <lb/>
where she lived to send for her when anyone had <lb/>
a cut or bruise or sick animal. "During her girlhood," <lb/>
says the lady who has written her life, "she was chief <lb/>
almoner to the cottages around her home, and nursed <lb/>
all illnesses under the advice of her mother and the <lb/>
vicar." Her favourite books were those that taught <lb/>
of helpfulness to the suffering and miserable, and it <lb/>
seemed as if her whole nature was turning toward <lb/>
her great work. While still a young girl she became <lb/>
interested in what Elizabeth Fry had done in English <lb/>
prisons, and she paid an interested visit to Mrs. Fry.</p>
<p>When in London she would visit hospitals and kindred <lb/>
institutions, and it is said that in the family travels in <lb/>
Egypt she nursed to health several sick Arabs. Her <lb/>
tastes and time, it is evident, were turned toward a <lb/>
humane and benevolent rather than a social life. Thus <lb/>
passed the years of her younger womanhood.</p>
<p>She had withdrawn from gaieties to learn whatever <lb/>
she could of the hospitals of London, Edinburgh and <lb/>
Dublin, and indeed, of the civil and military hospitals <lb/>
of all Europe, and finally in 1851, she went into training <lb/>
as a nurse in a famous institution at Kaiserwerth on <lb/>
the Rhine. Here, when she had taken the course of <lb/>
instruction, she passed a distinguished examination. <lb/>
After a short period of further study in Paris she <lb/>
returned to her beautiful English home for rest.</p>
<p>But at this time a hospital and home in London for <lb/>
sick and aged governesses was about to fail from lack <lb/>
of means and lack of able direction. To this Miss <lb/>
<pb n="272" entity="b002082275_0297"/>
Nightingale gave herself with ardour, and so renewed <lb/>
its strength that it still remains a witness to her energy. <lb/>
She gave largely to this institution. Nevertheless she <lb/>
was to be found, says a visitor, "organising the nurses, <lb/>
attending to the correspondence, prescriptions and <lb/>
accounts; in short, performing all the duties of a <reg orig="hard-|working">hardworking</reg> <lb/>
matron."</p>
<p>Ten years she had been serving apprenticeship for <lb/>
the great work of her life, and now she was thirty-four <lb/>
years old. In 1854 a war broke out between England <lb/>
and Russia. It is known as the Crimean War. England <lb/>
sent her soldiers to the Black Sea in many thousands. <lb/>
These soldiers were sadly clad and fed. Bad <reg orig="manage-|ment">management</reg> <lb/>
sees to have prevailed, and the service for carrying <lb/>
supplies was inadequate. Warm clothing, blankets, <lb/>
tents and other protection failed to reach the troops. <lb/>
"What a mockery," says one writer, "it must have <lb/>
seemed to the poor fellows, who with scanty rations <lb/>
and in threadbare and tattered clothes, were enduring <lb/>
the most cruel fatigues aggravated by wind and rain <lb/>
and snow and cold upon the bleak heights of the Tauric <lb/>
Chersonese," to hear comforts had been sent them. <lb/>
"What men of courageous mould have been seen 'to <lb/>
weep,' as on night after night, succeeding days of <reg orig="star-|vation">starvation</reg> <lb/>
and toil, they were ordered to their work in <lb/>
freezing trenches, who can estimate the exhausting misery <lb/>
they had at first endured?"</p>
<p>"It is now pouring rain," wrote another who was <lb/>
there, "the skies are black as ink &mdash; the wind is howling <lb/>
over the staggering tents &mdash; the trenches are turned into <lb/>
dykes &mdash; in the tents the water is sometimes a foot deep <lb/>
&mdash; our men have not either warm or waterproof <reg orig="cloth-|ing&mdash;they">clothing&mdash;they</reg> <lb/>
are out for twelve hours at a time in the trenches <lb/>
<pb n="273" entity="b002082275_0298"/>
&mdash; they are plunged into the inevitable miseries of a <lb/>
winter campaign &mdash; and not a soul seems to care for <lb/>
their comfort, or even for their lives. The wretched <lb/>
beggar who wanders about the streets of London in the <lb/>
rain, leads the life of a prince, compared with the British <lb/>
soldiers who are fighting out here for their country.</p>
<p>"The commonest accessories of a hospital are wanting; <lb/>
there is not the least attention paid to decency or <reg orig="clean-|liness">cleanliness</reg>; <lb/>
the fetid air can barely struggle out to taint the <lb/>
atmosphere, save through the chinks in the walls and <lb/>
roofs, and, for all I can observe, these men die without <lb/>
the least effort being made to save them. There they <lb/>
lie, just as they were let gently down on the ground by the <lb/>
poor fellows, their comrades, who brought them on their <lb/>
backs from the camp with the greatest tenderness, but who <lb/>
are not allowed to remain with them. The sick appear <lb/>
to be tended by the sick, and the dying by the dying."</p>
<p>During that winter of 1854, many were frozen in their <lb/>
tents. Of nearly forty-five thousand, over eighteen <lb/>
thousand were reported in the hospitals. The English <lb/>
people at last saw their disaster, and certain women <lb/>
volunteered services of helpfulness. The head of the <lb/>
War Department of the Government who knew of <lb/>
Miss Nightingale's interest in nursing, asked her to <lb/>
superintend and organise a staff of nurses. By a strange <lb/>
coincidence Florence Nightingale had written and offered <lb/>
her aid to the sick and wounded soldiers, and her letter <lb/>
passed the letter from the Government.</p>
<p>It was an undertaking wholly new to English habits <lb/>
&mdash;a band of devoted women going to soften the horrors <lb/>
of war and save lives the war had endeavoured to end. <lb/>
As the nurses landed at Boulogne in France, the poor <lb/>
fisherwomen seized and carried their baggage in token <lb/>
<pb n="274" entity="b002082275_0299"/>
of their admiration for the work they were starting out <lb/>
to do. And in their journey through France the <reg orig="inn-|keepers">innkeepers</reg> <lb/>
would not take pay for their lodgings and food. <lb/>
They sailed across the Mediterranean and in November, <lb/>
1854, reached Scutari, a town in Turkey in Asia, <reg orig="oppo-|site">opposite</reg> <lb/>
Constantinople.</p>
<p>Four thousand sick and wounded soldiers lay in the <lb/>
hospitals awaiting their ministrations. And still others <lb/>
from a great battle were coming in. These hospitals were <lb/>
so filled that even in the corridors were two rows of <lb/>
mattresses and so close together that two persons could <lb/>
barely walk between the rows. The beds reeked with <lb/>
infection. There was no thought, seemingly, of <reg orig="sani-|tation">sanitation</reg>. <lb/>
Rather than curers the hospitals were breeders <lb/>
of pestilence.</p>
<p>"The whole of yesterday one could only forget one's <lb/>
own existence," wrote one of the nurses, "for it was <lb/>
spent first in sewing the men's mattresses, and then in <lb/>
washing them, and assisting the surgeons, when we <lb/>
could, in dressing their ghastly wounds after their five <lb/>
days' confinement on board ship, during which space <lb/>
hundreds of wounds had not been dressed. Hundreds <lb/>
of men with fever, dysentery and cholera &lpar;the wounded <lb/>
were the smaller portion&rpar; filled the wards in succession <lb/>
from the overcrowded transports." Such were the <reg orig="con-|ditions">conditions</reg> <lb/>
this band of women found.</p>
<p>The head of the band, Miss Nightingale, began her <lb/>
work of organisation. She laboured with tireless energy <lb/>
and indomitable will. But not without opposition. The <lb/>
military and medical officials, says one who was there, <lb/>
"were in the uttermost confusion among themselves, and <lb/>
they generally regarded these gentle missionaries as a <lb/>
new element of anarchy."</p>
<pb n="275" entity="b002082275_0300"/>
<p>As soon as the wounded soldiers had had treatment, <lb/>
Miss Nightingale set in active operations a kitchen where <lb/>
food fit for the sick might be prepared. Many <reg orig="hun-|dreds">hundreds</reg> <lb/>
of the invalids could not eat of ordinary food <lb/>
without serious evil results. In this kitchen the nurses <lb/>
cooked nourishing delicacies for the poor fellows The <lb/>
following is a little snapshot by one who was there: "In <lb/>
the outer room we caught a glimpse of the justly celebrated <lb/>
Miss Nightingale, an amiable and highly <reg orig="intelligent-|looking">intelligent-looking</reg> <lb/>
lady, delicate in form and prepossessing in <reg orig="ap-|pearance">appearance</reg>. <lb/>
Her energies were concentrated for the <reg orig="in-|stant">instant</reg> <lb/>
in the careful preparation of a dish of delectable <lb/>
food for an enfeebled patient &mdash; one of her homely <reg orig="min-|istrations">ministrations</reg> <lb/>
to the wan victims of relentless war."</p>
<p>After the kitchen the master &mdash; or mistress &mdash; mind <lb/>
planned a laundry where the clothing and beds of the <lb/>
sick men might be cleansed. Miss Nightingale, you <lb/>
see, merely organised and conducted housekeeping <lb/>
upon a giant scale. Then in addition she set on foot <lb/>
evening lectures for the men able to listen, and a library <lb/>
and a schoolroom.</p>
<p>Nevertheless she gave distinct and individual service. <lb/>
"I believe," wrote one, "that there never was a severe <lb/>
case of any kind that escaped her notice; and sometimes <lb/>
it was wonderful to see her at the bedside of a patient <lb/>
who had been admitted perhaps but an hour before, <lb/>
and of whose arrival one would hardly have supposed it <lb/>
possible she could already be cognisant."</p>
<p>"As her slender form glided quietly along each <reg orig="corri-|dor">corridor</reg> <lb/>
every poor fellow's face softens with gratitude at <lb/>
the sight of her," wrote another. "When all the medical <lb/>
officers have retired for the night and silence and <reg orig="dark-|ness">darkness</reg> <lb/>
have settled down on the miles of prostrate sick, she <lb/>
<pb n="276" entity="b002082275_0301"/>
may be observed alone with a little lamp in her hand <lb/>
making her solitary rounds. No one who has observed <lb/>
her fragile figure and delicate health can avoid <reg orig="mis-|givings">misgivings</reg> <lb/>
lest these should fail. With the heart of a true <lb/>
woman and the manners of a lady she combines a <reg orig="sur-|prising">surprising</reg> <lb/>
calmness of judgment and promptitude and <lb/>
decision of character."</p>
<p>"To see her pass was happiness," one poor fellow <lb/>
said. "As she passed down the beds she would nod <lb/>
to one and smile at many more; but she could not do <lb/>
it to all, you know. We lay there by hundreds; but we <lb/>
could kiss her shadow as it fell, and lay our heads upon <lb/>
the pillows again, content."</p>
<p>"The magic of her power over men used often to be <lb/>
felt," wrote Kinglake the historian, "in the room&mdash;the <lb/>
dreaded, the blood-stained room &mdash; where 'operations' <lb/>
took place. There perhaps the maimed soldier, if not yet <lb/>
resigned to his fate, might at first be craving death rather <lb/>
than meet the knife of the surgeon; but when such a <lb/>
one looked and saw that the honoured lady-in-chief <lb/>
was patiently standing by him and, with lips closely <lb/>
set and hands folded, decreeing herself to go through <lb/>
the pain of witnessing pain, he used to fall into the mood <lb/>
of obeying the silent command, and, finding strange <lb/>
support in her presence, bring himself to submit and <lb/>
endure."</p>
<p>Every fresh detachment of the wounded meant fresh <lb/>
work for the band of devoted women. Miss <reg orig="Nightin-|gale">Nightingale</reg> <lb/>
was always among the busiest and she was known <lb/>
to stand for twenty hours assisting at operations, <reg orig="direct-|ing">directing</reg> <lb/>
nurses, herself ministering to cholera and fever <lb/>
patients and distributing stores. Once she was <reg orig="pros-|trated">prostrated</reg> <lb/>
by fever for some weeks. Illness also attacked <lb/>
<pb n="277" entity="b002082275_0302"/>
others of the nurses and many were laid in quiet graves <lb/>
in that distant land.</p>
<p>At last the fighting was brought to an end. For <lb/>
a year and a half had the noble and humane work of <lb/>
nursing gone on and shown the world how much greater <lb/>
is the saving of lives than the destruction of lives by the <lb/>
murder of war. The gratitude the English people felt <lb/>
for what the nurses had done they expressed by a gift <lb/>
of fifty thousand pounds to Miss Nightingale after her <lb/>
return to England. They had planned also a public <lb/>
welcome of their heroine, but with the modesty and calm <lb/>
judgment that always characterised her, she slipped <lb/>
quietly into England by the carriage of a French steamer <lb/>
and so to her country home. Queen Victoria, who with <lb/>
her husband the Prince Consort, had most earnestly <lb/>
admired Miss Nightingale's course, and had sought <lb/>
direct knowledge of her work during her stay in the <lb/>
East, entertained her at Balmoral and presented her with <lb/>
a valuable jewel. The sum presented her by the nation <lb/>
was, at her request, given to the foundation of a training <lb/>
home for nurses in connection with St. Thomas's <reg orig="Hos-|pital">Hospital</reg>. <lb/>
It is called the "Nightingale Home."</p>
<p>This "Angel of the Crimea" returned to England so <lb/>
enfeebled with arduous labour that she has never since <lb/>
entered active life. She lived many years, perforce, in <lb/>
her own sick-room with scarcely strength to pen a letter, <lb/>
and saw no one but closest associates. The knowledge <lb/>
and experience she had got in public service, however, <lb/>
she gave to the world in part in her "Notes on Nursing" <lb/>
and "Notes on Hospitals," and other publications. <lb/>
Several Governments have sought her advice upon the <lb/>
sanitation of army camps, and the Red Cross Society <lb/>
is in part from her aid and endeavour.</p>
<pb n="278" entity="b002082275_0303"/>
<p>Her "Notes on Nursing" are full of sound sense and <lb/>
we should be more fortunate if the knowledge in them <lb/>
were more general than it is.</p>
<p>"Everything you do in a patient's room after he is <lb/>
'put up' for the night increases tenfold the risk of his <lb/>
having a bad night; but if you rouse him up after he has <lb/>
fallen asleep, you do not risk&mdash;you secure him a bad <lb/>
night."</p>
<p>"Conciseness and decision are above all things <reg orig="nec-|essary">necessary</reg> <lb/>
with the sick. Let your doubt be to yourself, <lb/>
your decision to them."</p>
<p>"Above all leave the sick-room quietly, and come <lb/>
into it quietly; not suddenly, not with a rush."</p>
<p>"Remember never to lean against, sit upon or <reg orig="un-|necessarily">unnecessarily</reg> <lb/>
shake the bed upon which a patient lies."</p>
<p>"An extraordinary fallacy is the dread of night air," <lb/>
she wrote. "What air can we breathe at night but night <lb/>
air? The choice is between pure night air from without <lb/>
and foul night air from within. Most people prefer <lb/>
the latter&mdash;an unaccountable choice. What will they say <lb/>
if it be proved true that fully one-half of all the disease <lb/>
we suffer from is occasioned by people sleeping with <lb/>
their windows shut? An open window most nights of <lb/>
the year can never hurt anyone. In great cities night <lb/>
air is often the best and purest to be had in the <reg orig="twenty-|four">twenty-four</reg> <lb/>
hours."</p>
<p>"The five essentials, for healthy houses," she again <lb/>
says, "are pure air, pure water, efficient drainage, <reg orig="clean-|liness">cleanliness</reg> <lb/>
and light. I have known whole houses and <lb/>
hospitals smell of the sink. I have met just as strong <lb/>
a stream of sewer air coming up the back staircase of a <lb/>
grand London house, from the sink, as I have ever met <lb/>
at Scutari; and I have seen the rooms in that house all <lb/>
<pb n="279" entity="b002082275_0304"/>
ventilated by the open doors, and the passages all <reg orig="unventi-|lated">unventilated</reg> <lb/>
by the close windows, in order that as much of the <lb/>
sewer air as possible might be conducted into and <lb/>
retained in the bedrooms. It is wonderful!"</p>
<p>She is opposed to dark houses; says they promote <lb/>
scrofula; to old papered walls and to carpets full of dust. <lb/>
An uninhabited room becomes full of foul air soon, and <lb/>
needs to have the windows open often. She would keep <lb/>
sick people, or well, forever in the sunlight if possible, <lb/>
for sunlight is the greatest possible purifier of the <reg orig="atmos-|phere">atmosphere</reg>. <lb/>
"In the unsunned sides of narrow streets," she <lb/>
writes, "there is degeneracy and weakliness of the human <lb/>
race &mdash; mind and body equally degenerating. Oh, the <lb/>
crowded school, where so many children's epidemics <lb/>
have their origin, what a tale its air test would tell!"</p>
<p>"Nursing is an art; and if it is to be made an art, <reg orig="re-|quires">requires</reg> <lb/>
as exclusive a devotion, as hard a preparation, as <lb/>
any painter's or sculptor's work; for what is the having <lb/>
to do with dead canvas or cold marble compared with <lb/>
having to do with the living body, the temple of God's <lb/>
Spirit? Nursing is one of the fine arts; I had almost <lb/>
said, the finest of the fine arts."</p>
<p>Miss Nightingale is living with her great work done. <lb/>
Still she continues and will ever continue, her <reg orig="minis-|trations">ministrations</reg> <lb/>
in the bravery, devotion and unselfishness of <lb/>
every nurse and in the effective work of every hospital.</p>
