                    making these appointments in collaboration with <name>Mr. Fralin</name>, the
                    Vice Rector, who will become Rector on July 1<hi rend="super">st</hi>, and he
                    asked Members to make their wishes known to <name>Mr. Fralin</name>.</p>
                <p> The Rector reminded Members of the Board's customary participation in the summer
                    orientation of incoming students, and he encouraged Members to sign up for

                    <head>PRESIDENT'S REPORT: COMMISSION ON THE FUTURE OF THE UNIVERSITY </head>
                    <p> The President discussed some current planning efforts underway at the
                        University. A Commission on the Future of the University has been formed
                        under the co-chairmanship of <name>Mr. Sandridge</name> and <name>Dr.
                            Garson</name>. The Commission has been charged with proposing directions
                        for the University for the next ten years. He said the work of the
                        Commission brings together several planning efforts already underway and
                        that it is particularly timely, given the imminent departure of the Provost,
                        the needs of the Campaign, and planning for the succession of several key
                        University officials.</p>
                    <p> The Commission has been organized with four committees: Schools and the
                        Medical Center; Programmatic Initiatives; Faculty and Student Life; and
                        Funding and Other Resources. The Committees are to deliver draft plans in
                        their respective areas by May 15<hi rend="super">th</hi>. The new Provost
                        will review these plans over the summer and return them to the committees by
                        the start of the fall semester. </p>
                    <p> Using the plans drafted by the committees, the Commission will write a final
                        report and submit it to the President by the end of the fall semester. The
                        plan will go to the Board's Special Committee on Planning in February, 2008,
                        and the Committee will forward it to the full Board. </p>

                    <head>PRESIDENT'S REPORT: FACULTY HIRES </head>
                    <p> The President announced an important faculty hire as part of the Board's
                        efforts to enhance science and technology research at the University:
                            <name>Joseph Takahashi</name>, currently professor of neurobiology and
                        physiology at Northwestern University. <name>Mr. Takahashi</name>, who is a
                        member of the National Academy of Sciences, is one of the world's leading
                        biological-clock researchers. He will hold an endowed chair in the
                        Department of Biology and will be the director of a new Center for Circadian
                        and Systems Biology. </p>
                    <p>
                        <name>Mr. Takahashi</name>'s appointment becomes effective in September,
                        2008. He will bring with him a multi-million dollar laboratory, which is
                        being funded by the National Institutes of Health and other
                        organizations.</p>
                    <p> The President pointed out that <name>Mr. Takahashi</name> is the sixth
                        National Academies-level researcher hired by the University in less than two
                        years as part of the Board's Distinguished Senior Scientist Recruitment

                    <p> The President reminded the Board that the University is undergoing
                        re-accreditation by SACS - the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools
                        - and he reported on the process. Two required documents have been submitted
                        to SACS by the University: the Compliance Certification and the Quality
                        Enhancement Plan. An external committee visited the Grounds in March to
                        review the Quality Enhancement Plan and the University's compliance work.
                        The committee is preparing its final report which, the President said, is
                        expected to be laudatory overall. SACS will vote in December on the
                        re-accreditation of the University.</p>
                    <p>The Quality Enhancement Plan the University submitted to SACS focuses on
                        enhancing student-faculty engagement. </p>

                    <name>Ms. Sheehy</name>, Vice President for Management and Budget, led the
                    discussion, which was centered on restructuring-related performance measures.
                    Restructuring refers to the 2005 Restructured Higher Education Financial and
                    Administrative Operations Act, adopted by the General Assembly, and to the 2006
                    Management Agreement. The Act required the Board of Visitors to meet a set of
                    eleven statewide goals; the Board on <date value="2005-06-10">June 10,
                        2005</date>, approved the University's commitment to meet these goals. The
                    General Assembly later added a twelfth goal that does not become effective until
                    2007-2008. </p>

                    with the State Council in developing the Standards and established benchmarks
                    and targets for each measure. SCHEV staff will recommend certification of

                <head>APPROVAL OF INCREASE IN TUITION, REQUIRED FEES, AND OTHER CHARGES FOR THE
                    ACADEMIC DIVISION </head>

                <p> WHEREAS, in October 2005, the University of Virginia submitted a six year
                    financial plan to the Commonwealth, which included a projection of a 2007-08
                    in-state tuition and educational and general (E&amp;G) fee increase of 9.9
                    percent to $6,906; and </p>

                <p> WHEREAS, in the 2007 General Assembly session, the Commonwealth instituted a
                    Tuition Incentive Fund to encourage colleges and universities to increase
                    in-state undergraduate tuition and E&amp;G fees by no more than six percent for
                    educational and general purposes; and </p>

                <p> WHEREAS, the Tuition Incentive Fund allows for tuition and E&amp;G fee increases
                    in excess of six percent, but limited to the projection in the Six Year Plan,
                    provided the incremental revenues are allocated to increasing in-state
                    undergraduate financial aid over the level funded in 2006-2007; </p>

                <p> RESOLVED that the tuition and required fees and other charges applicable to the
                    Academic Division be approved as shown below, effective <date value="2007-07-01"
                        >July 1, 2007</date>.</p>

                <p> RESOLVED FURTHER that $1.5 million, the incremental revenue generated by a 8.6
                    percent in-state undergraduate tuition and E&amp;G fee increase versus a six
                    percent in-state undergraduate tuition and E&amp;G fee increase, be allocated to
                    increase financial aid for in-state undergraduates above the 2006-2007 level. </p>

                <p>WHEREAS, <name>Kenneth P. Asbury</name> was born in Wise County in 1922; and </p>

                <p>WHEREAS, <name>Mr. Asbury</name>, after service in the United States Army during
                    the Second World War, took both his undergraduate and Law degrees from
                    Washington and Lee University; and </p>

                <p> WHEREAS, <name>Mr. Asbury</name> returned to Wise County after graduation to
                    begin the practice of the Law, a practice that he continued for fifty years
                    becoming, in due course, President of the Virginia State Bar, and the Wise
                    County Bar Association, Commonwealth's Attorney for Wise County for sixteen
                    years; and </p>

                <p> WHEREAS, <name>Mr. Asbury</name> gave a lifetime of service to Southwest
                    Virginia and to Wise County, having been, at one time or another a member of
                    virtually every board and organization in the county; and </p>

                <p> WHEREAS, <name>Mr. Asbury</name> is perhaps best known as one of "The Three Wise
                    Men," the delegation of three prominent Wise citizens who in 1954 persuaded
                    President Darden to approve the establishment of Clinch Valley College, now The
                    University of Virginia's College at Wise; and </p>

                <p> WHEREAS, <name>Mr. Asbury</name> was named to the College's first advisory board
                    and served until his death on <date value="2007-03-12">March 12,
                    2007</date>;</p>

                <p> RESOLVED, The Board of Visitors notes with sorrow the passing of <name>Kenneth
                        P. Asbury</name>, citizen of Wise, pays honor to his life of service, to his
                    community, to Southwest Virginia and to the Commonwealth, and above all honors
                    his role in the founding of The University of Virginia's College at Wise; and </p>

                <p> RESOLVED FURTHER, the Board expresses its deepest sympathy to <name>Mrs.
                        Asbury</name> and her family. </p>

                <head>COMMENDING THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY'S RESOLUTION ON SLAVERY </head>

                <p> WHEREAS, the General Assembly of Virginia in its 2007 Session adopted
                    resolutions acknowledging "with profound regret the involuntary servitude of
                    Africans....and calling for reconciliation among all Virginians;" and </p>

                <p> WHEREAS, the Governor has signed the resolutions; and </p>

                <p> WHEREAS, the Board of Visitors commends the Governor and the General Assembly
                    for these actions and expresses its regret for the institution of slavery in
                    this state; and </p>

                <p> WHEREAS, the notion of involuntary servitude is repugnant and incompatible with
                    the ideals upon which this University was founded, the ideals upon which the
                    Commonwealth was organized in 1776, and the ideals embodied in our national
                    Declaration of Independence in the same year; and </p>

                <p> WHEREAS, the mostly anonymous laborers employed in the construction of the
                    University were both enslaved and free, as was the University's workforce
                    between 1825 and 1865; and </p>

                <p> WHEREAS, the Board expresses its particular regret for the employment of
                    enslaved persons in these years; and </p>

                <p> WHEREAS, the Board expresses as well its profound respect for the contributions
                    of these women and men, by whose ingenuity and labor much of what is now admired
                    at the University as a national and world treasure came to be; </p>

                <p> RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors recommits itself to the principles of equal
                    opportunity and to the principle that human freedom and learning are and must be
                    inextricably linked in this Commonwealth and in this Republic; and </p>

                <p> RESOLVED FURTHER, the Board affirms that the benefits of useful knowledge must
                    belong commonly to all who present themselves qualified for admission to the
                    University, and that this useful knowledge ought to be the common treasure of
                    all who come here. </p>

                <p> (Several Members commented that the resolution is "long overdue.")</p>
