                    <head>Foreword to the Electronic Version</head>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="bold">1) Michael Plunkett</hi>
                    </p>

                    <p>When I was first contacted about the possibility of publishing <hi
                            rend="italic">Afro-American Sources</hi> as an electronic work, my
                        reaction was negative. What I remember most about my work on the book was
                        the enjoyment of visiting many institutions and examining outstanding
                        collections, with the aid of a grant that enabled me to devote my total
                        energy to the project. I could not imagine expanding the work without the
                        luxury of such uninterrupted time. But then I considered the flexibility
                        inherent in an electronic work. It is never static. It becomes kinetic,
                        always available for additions. The more I deliberated, the more advantages
                        became apparent. This work would require close involvement with the
                        University Press and the Electronic Text Center at the University of
                        Virginia Library. We would have to work together to examine this new process
                        and our cooperation would establish a framework for future electronic
                        publications. </p>
                    <p>Another benefit was the inclusion of images, prohibited in the print edition
                        for reasons of cost. Most significantly, the work would be available to a
                        wider and constantly expanding audience. Once I was convinced of the
                        efficacy of an electronic edition, the obvious place to begin adding new
                        entries was with my own institution, the University of Virginia. I surveyed
                        our holdings since 1990 and added twenty new entries. With the assistance of
                        the University Press, I updated addresses and added phone and fax numbers
                        and e-mail addresses to those institutions that responded to a request for
                        such information. Finally the most enjoyable part was selecting the images
                        and then helping David Seaman, Director of the Electronic Text Center, to
                        scan them. </p>
                    <p>The next obvious step is to update all the repositories and add new
                        collections and institutions. This depends, of course, mainly on others
                        submitting the information. It is my hope and the hope of the University
                        Press of Virginia and the Electronic Text Center that we can periodically
                        update this work and truly never finish it. </p>

                    </p>

                    <p>This guide is a joint collaboration between Michael Plunkett, The University
                        Press of Virginia, and the University of Virginia's Electronic Text Center.
                        It was undertaken both as an opportunity to provide an expanded version of
                        Michael's book and as a training exercise for a Press ambitious to get to
                        grips with a new publishing medium. While we still do not have the "pay per
                        use" charging mechanisms in place that will make Internet publishing a
                        commercial venture of the sort we would like, the Director of the University
                        Press realised clearly that the time had come in late 1993 to tackle the
                        production and distribution issues of the new medium. </p>

                    <p>The labor of producing the <hi rend="italic">Guide</hi> was divided between
                        the participants, each drawing on his or her own strengths. The print text
                        of the first edition was scanned in at the Electronic Text Center by members
                        of the Press, who in the process learned something about scanning
                        technology. The newly created electronic files were delivered to Michael
                        Plunkett, who made his additions and revisions. After some editorial work
                        and proofing at the Press they were returned to the Electronic Text Center
                        where the WordPerfect files were converted to Standard Generalised Markup
                        Language (hereafter SGML) encoding, following the Text Encoding Initiative
                        Guidelines (hereafter TEI), and parsed. </p>

                    <p>The level of SGML markup is not exhaustive, and much was done by automatic
                        means, principally a series of "search and replace" routines in WordPerfect
                        and SED that turned proprietary markup and implicit patterns of spacial
                        layout into explicit SGML tags. The resulting TEI document allows us both to
                        have a browsing copy on the World Wide Web, by converting the TEI tags
                        automatically to HTML, and also to provide a searchable document that
                        contains database categories and sectional divisions. The Web "forms"
                        interface to this searchable database was designed by Jeff Herrin, in the
                        University of Virginia Library's Systems Office. The search software is PAT,
                        from OpenText, the same tool we use for all our on- line full-text databases
                        at the University of Virginia. </p>
                    <p>The final stage of the production was to scan a set of digital images of some
                        of the items in the University of Virginia section of the <hi rend="italic"
                            >Guide</hi>. Michael Plunkett and I digitized various manuscripts and
                        photographs, creating TIFF format images at 300 dpi. From these archival
                        TIFF copies, JPEG files were made for use on-line. A text description and
                        cataloging record was added into the binary code of these image files, for
                        reasons of data control and attribution, according to a practise popularized
                        by the Electronic Text Center. Finally, I needed only to write the main Web
                        page for the book and connect the various parts together, drawing on the
                        design expertise of Janet Anderson from the University Press. </p>

                    <p> This project has been a good example of collaboration between publishers and
                        libraries, information managers and scholars, each drawing on his or her
                        particular skills and each learning from the other. </p>

                    <p>Since the <hi rend="italic">Guide</hi> has been on-line, it has garnered
                        considerable attention and use; most constructively, perhaps, was the new
                        submission that was sent in from the Thomas Balch Library in Leesburg, Va.
                        After reading about the <hi rend="italic">Guide</hi> in a Virginia newspaper
                        &mdash; being the first full University Press publication on the
                        Internet generated several press features &mdash; they contacted Michael
                        Plunkett with the details of five collections in their library that were
                        pertinent to the subject of the <hi rend="italic">Guide</hi>, and we were
                        able to add them as a new section the same day. </p>
                    <p>For this type of work, it would be desirable in the future for the various
                        institutions featured in it to take responsibility for their sections and
                        run them from their own Internet servers, with images of selected items
                        provided in the same manner that we have done for the University of Virginia
                        section. That would be truly to take advantage of the possibilities of the
                        medium, and help ensure that the <hi rend="italic">Guide</hi> keeps current. </p>

                    <p>The scholar's research strategy is influenced by the basic constraints of
                        time and money. Choices must be made as to which archives are to be visited
                        and how much time is to be allowed at each. Once there, the more effectively
                        the time can be used in finding and examining relevant materials, the more
                        productive will be the research endeavor. It is for these reasons that
                        publications such as Michael Plunkett's <hi rend="italic">Afro-American
                            Sources in Virginia: A Guide to Manuscripts</hi> are so valuable to
                        scholars. Plunkett, Curator of Manuscripts at the University of Virginia
                        Library, here presents the information derived from a survey of the
                        resources in Virginia repositories, describing the principal collections of
                        interest to scholars concerned with the Afro-American experience. In these
                        Virginia repositories there are extensive collections of primary documents,
                        only some of which deal with Afro-Americans. This compilation will greatly
                        aid the researcher, who will be able to use the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Guide</hi>'s annotations to focus upon those specific collections with
                        materials of interest. </p>
                    <p>Although Virginia repositories include collections with materials related to
                        the Afro-American experience in other parts of the South and in the North,
                        the most important of the collections are for the colony and state of
                        Virginia. These run in time from the seventeenth century to the current
                        period. Collections include the papers, letters, and records of individuals
                        and families; documents of towns, cities, and counties; official state
                        records; church records; material from the Works Projects Administration
                        Folklore Collection; college and university archives; and a variety of other
                        types of documents of importance for understanding the Afro-American
                        experience. </p>
                    <p>While it can hardly be claimed that the story of Afro-Americans in Virginia
                        has been neglected by historians or that these collections have been ignored
                        by those writing on Afro-Americans, an examination of the <hi rend="italic"
                            >Guide</hi> and of the collections themselves points to several areas in
                        which important new research using these archives is possible. Reflecting my
                        interests and use of archival sources, there are some particular areas
                        related to the late eighteenth and the nineteenth century which I wish to
                        note. </p>
                    <p>Virginia's importance, as measured by its percentage of the overall
                        Afro-American population, declined dramatically over the course of the
                        nineteenth century: about two-fifths of the Afro-Americans in the United
                        States resided in Virginia at the time of the first census (about 95 percent
                        of them enslaved), the share falling to about one-eighth on the eve of the
                        Civil War, and about one-tenth by 1880. Yet as late as 1860 Virginia still
                        had more Afro-Americans (and more slaves) than did any other state. For all
                        the writings on antebellum slavery, we still have much to learn about the
                        distinct economics and culture of slavery in Virginia. While most writings
                        focus on the cotton South with its large plantations, Virginia slavery was
                        characterized by relatively small slave farms, growing mainly tobacco and
                        wheat. Thus in many important dimensions slavery in Virginia was different,
                        for slaves and for masters, than slavery elsewhere in the South. </p>
                    <p>Many of these Virginia repositories have been used by scholars writing on the
                        history of slavery in Virginia from the colonial era to the Civil War.
                        Several of the archives were recently used by Allan Kulikoff when writing
                        his important study of slavery in the early Chesapeake, <hi rend="italic"
                            >Tobacco and Slaves: The Development of Southern Cultures in the
                            Chesapeake <dateRange from="1680" to="1800">1680-1800</dateRange></hi>.
                        Robert McColley's <hi rend="italic">Slavery and Jeffersonian Virginia</hi>
                        remains the major work on its period, but there is no similar work on
                        Virginia slavery covering the important years of 1820-60. As a survey of
                        their bibliographies and references sources will indicate, many of the
                        writings of the past decades on American slavery consulted Virginia
                        collections. Of particular note are the important writings of two major
                        African American historians, Luther Porter Jackson (<hi rend="italic">Free Negro Labor
                            and Property Holding in Virginia 1830-1860</hi>) and James Hugo Johnston
                            (<hi rend="italic">Race Relations in Virginia and Miscegenation in the
                            South <dateRange from="1776" to="1860">1776-1860</dateRange></hi>), both
                        of whose papers are now available to scholars at Virginia State University.
                        More recently, for their heavy reliance on these sources one can, in
                        particular, point to Todd L. Savitt's <hi rend="italic">Medicine and
                            Slavery: The Diseases and Health Care of Blacks in Antebellum
                        Virginia</hi> and, for the use of one part of the extensive John Hartwell
                        Cocke collection at the University of Virginia Library, the letters of
                        slaves and ex-slaves to their former master in Randall M. Miller's edited
                        collection <hi rend="italic">"Dear Master": Letters of a Slave Family</hi>. </p>
                    <p>In addition, for different aspects of the slave experience, there are Richard
                        Dunn's use of the plantation records in the Tayloe Papers at the Virginia
                        Historical Society; Charles B. Dew's study of the Tredegar Iron Works, <hi
                            rend="italic">Ironmaker to the Confederacy: Joseph R. Anderson and the
                            Tredegar Iron Works</hi>, based primarily on the company's records now
                        at the Virginia State Library; and Mechal Sobel's <hi rend="italic"
                            >Trabelin' On: The Slave Journey to an Afro-Baptist Faith</hi> and her
                            <hi rend="italic">The World They Made Together: Black and White Values
                            in Eighteenth-Century Virginia</hi>. Suzanne Lebsock's significant study
                        of <hi rend="italic">The Free Women of Petersburg: Status and Culture in a
                            Southern Town, 1784-1860</hi>, which includes an examination of free
                        women of color, similarly draws heavily upon materials from several Virginia
                        repositories. More, however, can be done on the host of issues related to
                        Afro-American slaves and free persons of color in Virginia by using many of
                        the cited collections. A fuller examination of, for example, African American
                        demography can draw upon various planter listings of slaves, slave birth
                        registers, free black registers, and police daybooks &mdash; even the
                        detailed account book of a slave trader in the late antebellum period. </p>
                    <p>The atypical pattern of slavery in Virginia also makes the transition from
                        slavery to freedom, and the economic and social adjustments to emancipation,
                        a particularly interesting subject for examination. For this period, as for
                        the slave era, much of the recent work on political and economic changes has
                        concentrated upon those parts of the South in which the plantation had been
                        the dominant institution. Yet to more fully understand the impact of
                        emancipation, particularly in its economic aspects, attention to areas with
                        smaller farms, growing a different set of crops, is important. The focus
                        would contribute, for example, to the analysis of the factors explaining
                        postemancipation declines in agricultural production in the South, which
                        appear to have been smaller in Virginia than elsewhere in the South. There
                        are a number of collections with labor contracts between freedmen and
                        landowners, as well as sources with account books and farmers' letters, that
                        can be used to examine such questions, as was done by Crandall A. Shifflett,
                        drawing mainly upon the Watson Family Papers at the University of Virginia
                        Library, in his <hi rend="italic">Patronage and Poverty in the Tobacco
                            South: Louisa County, Virginia <dateRange from="1860" to="1900"
                                >1860-1900</dateRange></hi>. Not only would we expect the economic
                        effects of the end of slavery in Virginia to differ from those elsewhere,
                        but because of the differences in the relative numbers of African Americans and whites
                        (among other reasons) we would also anticipate variations in the social,
                        cultural, and political consequences. Some of these social and cultural
                        issues are examined by Robert Francis Engs in his <hi rend="italic"
                            >Freedom's First Generation: Black Hampton. Virginia <dateRange
                                from="1861" to="1890">1861-1890</dateRange></hi>, which utilizes the
                        Hampton University Archives. Moreover, the differences in the social and
                        economic adaptations made in the migration northward by those Afro-Americans
                        born in Virginia and those born elsewhere in the South means that studies of
                        Virginia slavery and emancipation will have wider implications. </p>
                    <p>There are obviously other questions and other periods for which archival
                        repositories in Virginia will prove very useful and for which this Guide
                        will be an essential aid. This compilation is most useful in drawing
                        attention to relevant collections and indicating the range of materials they
                        contain. The annotations for each collection and the subject index can be of
                        enormous help to scholars, leading them to those collections with materials
                        of interest and for which the examination of detailed inventories at the
                        repository will yield a high payoff. Use of the <hi rend="italic">Guide</hi>
                        will permit a great savings in time and effort, making it a most useful
                        reference aid to be consulted by scholars of Afro-American history,
                        literature, and culture. </p>

                    <p> This <hi rend="italic">Guide</hi> is a result of grant support that I
                        received from the Virginia Foundation for the Humanities and Public Policy
                        as a Fellow of the Virginia Center for the Humanities, but the motivation
                        and the need were established and recognized by historians, archivists, and
                        manuscripts curators long before that. The definition of an archivist is one
                        who cares for records, the person charged with both the preservation of the
                        record and the dissemination of the information contained in the record.
                        Historically this responsibility charged to the archivist has led to the
                        gathering of records primarily belonging to that class of people best
                        prepared by society to chronicle events: the public official, the landowner,
                        the educator, the business and industrial leader. When in the 1960s
                        historians began to question and change their own traditional approach,
                        archivists changed their collecting strategies to correspond to new
                        historical and sociological research and began to look to nontraditional
                        sources for archival records. This new vigor led to a major effort to
                        collect material on the history of Afro-Americans, but that endeavor, though
                        sustained by many institutions, has never garnered the amount and quality of
                        material about Afro-Americans demanded by the historian. The effort to
                        collect archival material documenting the history and culture of
                        Afro-Americans must continue; at the same time existing collections that
                        contain a wealth of Afro-American material must be examined and described.
                        Additionally, Afro-American materials in institutions, such as historically
                        black colleges, where they have long existed but have received little
                        publicity, must be described. I have tried in this work to search for new
                        sources but also to examine collections that may have been overlooked as
                        source material documenting the contribution of Afro-Americans. </p>
                    <p>The importance of original source materials to historians is obvious.
                        Afro-American historians, especially those writing about American slavery,
                        have long sought and used original source materials. Prominent historians
                        such as John Hope Franklin, Stanley Engerman, Eugene Genovese, John
                        Blassingame, Winthrop Jordan, Nathan Huggins, and Herbert Gutman have relied
                        on these materials to write their story of American slavery and the history
                        of the Afro-American. How could John Hope Franklin have written his
                        biography of the African American historian George Washington Williams if he hadn't
                        access to manuscript materials on the man? In fact, Franklin points out that
                        some of his information came from contacting libraries mentioned by Williams
                        in his preface to <hi rend="italic">History of the Negro Race</hi>. These
                        libraries were able to check their own archives and uncover correspondence
                        with Williams. The importance of original source material has been noted by
                        business, witnessed by the recent and continuing endeavor by the University
                        Publications of America to microfilm and make available original materials
                        on the subject of plantation slavery in the American South. This is a
                        massive project with a definite financial and staffing commitment, and the
                        end product is extremely expensive but judged worthy of the expense because
                        of the value of the materials on American slavery both for research and
                        pedagogical reasons. </p>
                    <p>The academic need for materials on American slavery is self-evident. In
                        addition to slavery, other topics, such as civil rights and voting rights,
                        and other histories, such as local, regional, and comparative studies, can
                        be written from materials that not only document Afro-Americans but are
                        generated by them. For example, the papers of Luther Porter Jackson, the
                        noted African American historian and educator, at Virginia State University are
                        obviously ripe for research. Another more recent area of interest is
                        Afro-American genealogy. The "Roots" phenomenon excited much interest in
                        African American genealogy, and now, after the initial media outburst, there remains a
                        strong interest. Another important need for this work has been expressed by
                        the archival/library profession: more and more library/archive users demand
                        subject access to such materials. This subject access will eventually be
                        satisfied when the massive amount of cataloging data of archives and
                        manuscripts is entered into computer data-bases. But this eventuality is far
                        in the future. As an interim measure, the compilation and publication of
                        subject guides serve to answer the urgent demand, especially for
                        Afro-American materials. </p>
                    <p>I initially contacted twenty-six institutions in Virginia, including college
                        and university repositories, black institutions, public libraries, and
                        private institutions. My search began in the <hi rend="italic">National
                            Union Catalog of Manuscript Collections</hi> where I examined every
                        entry on all Virginia institutions. Comparing those entries with the <hi
                            rend="italic">Directory of Afro-American Resources</hi> revealed the
                        deficiencies of that twenty-five-year-old guide. As an example, the <hi
                            rend="italic">Directory</hi> lists 20 collections relating to
                        Afro-Americans in the Virginia Historical Society; I was able to identify
                        173 during my visit. Most of the institutions contacted were manuscript
                        repositories; their collections are family papers and derivative in nature,
                        that is, whites writing about African Americans. Most of these collections revealed
                        Afro-American strength in two areas: materials on slavery and materials on
                        the civil rights era. In the beginning of the project the shortage of
                        materials in other areas led me to consider whether the search should be
                        limited to slavery and civil rights, but I decided against that approach,
                        because I knew that Afro-American materials outside of those two areas exist
                        and need to be publicized. </p>
                    <p> Several types of records were examined. </p>
                    <list>
                        <item>1. Plantation records. Although predominantly records kept by slave
                            owners, these sometimes include letters from former slaves or, as in the
                            University of Virginia collections, letters from former slaves who had
                            emigrated to Liberia. </item>
                        <item>2. Church records. Both African American and white churches are included; most of
                            the original source materials on African American churches have come from white
                            religious organizations.</item>
                        <item>3. Bible records. Many slave-owning families registered the births and
                            deaths of their slaves in their family bibles. </item>
                        <item>4. Diaries and travel journals of the South. Often there is comment on
                            the institution of slavery or individual slaves.</item>

                        <item>5. Photographs. Slave-owning families would sometimes have household
                            slaves photographed. </item>
                        <item>6. Medical records. These were kept both by slave owners and by
                            itinerant doctors.</item>
                        <item>7. Records of African American institutions, especially educational ones.</item>
                        <item>8. Autograph letters of well-known Afro-Americans. </item>
                        <item>9. Collections of Virginia politicians during Reconstruction and in
                            the Constitutional Convention of 1902 when Virginia blacks were
                            disfranchised. These collections also may contain material generated by
                            Afro-Americans, because these lawmakers might have tried to contact an
                            influential moderate African American leader such as Booker T. Washington to enlist
                            support.</item>
                        <item>10. Papers of educators in the South. Educators in the first part of
                            the twentieth century studied the Afro-American, often traveling to and
                            corresponding with African American institutions and educators. A prime example is
                            the collection at the University of Virginia of the Papers of Jackson
                            Davis, a white member of the Virginia General Board of Education who
                            traveled extensively in the South in the 1920s investigating African American
                            education.</item>
                        <item>11. Business records. Often laborers were recorded separately by race.</item>
                        <item>12. Collections of civil rights groups. In Virginia the papers of the
                            local groups involved in school integration are especially pertinent. </item>
                        <item>13. Afro-American authors. Such papers are sadly lacking in Virginia
                            repositories. </item>
                        <item>14. Papers of African American families. These are mostly in African American institutions,
                            but they do exist elsewhere.</item>
                        <item>15. State and local government records. State records are in the
                            Virginia State Library and Archives, but often local government records
                            are kept in other institutions. </item>
                    </list>

                    <p>The collections here are arranged alphabetically by their respective
                        repositories. The collection description, date range, and size refer to the
                        whole collection. The abstracts sometimes are based on a necessarily brief
                        examination; this is especially true of the larger collections which often
                        contain more Afro-American material than is described. Unless otherwise
                        indicated, all place names may be assumed to be in Virginia. If the
                        collection is available on microfilm, the microfilm number has been noted. </p>
                    <p>This work does not purport to be definitive; it is based solely on the
                        research and interpretation of the compiler. I wish to thank the Virginia
                        Foundation for the Humanities and Public Policy for providing the grant
                        support to accomplish my work and the University of Virginia Library's
                        Faculty Research Committee for granting me additional time to complete the
                        effort. </p>
