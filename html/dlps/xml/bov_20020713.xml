                <p>The Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia recessed its Annual Retreat,
                    briefly, to meet as the full Board to consider several proposed resolutions.
                    This was done between 1:15 and 1:20 p.m., in Open Session, on Saturday, <date
                        value="2002-07-13">July 13, 2002</date>, at Upper Brandon in Prince George
                    County.</p>
                <p>The Rector, <name type="present">Mr. Ackerly</name>, presided over the business
                    session. All Members of the Board were present: <name type="present">Mesdames
                        Holland and Twohy, and Messrs. Bliley, Crutchfield, Farrell, Glazer,
                        Goodwin, Greer, Kington, Pippin, Rainey, Ross, Saunders, Thompson, Vaughan
                        and Lovelace</name>.</p>
                <p> Also present were the President, <name type="present">Mr. Casteen</name>, as
                    well as <name type="present">Messrs. Sandridge, Gilliam and Forch, and Mesdames
                        Cronin and Bailes</name>.</p>
                <p><name>Mr. Sandridge</name>, the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating
                    Officer, told the Board that all proposals for legislation must be sent to
                    Richmond in September, which is before the next scheduled meeting of the full
                    Board; it was for this reason that the proposed legislation was being submitted
                    to the Board for approval as an adjunct to the Retreat.</p>
                <p>The first of the resolutions was a proposed change to the relevant section of the
                        <hi rend="underline">Code of Virginia</hi> to create a provision that
                    "deems" the Medical Center to be a licensed hospital; such a designation would
                    give the Medical Center the privileges, immunities, benefits and rights afforded
                    licensed hospitals under the law. Under the <hi rend="underline">Code</hi> the
                    Medical Center currently is exempt from state licensure and the proposed change
                    would in no way affect this exemption.</p>
                <p>On motion, the Board approved the following resolution.</p>

                <head type="main">APPROVAL OF UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA MEDICAL CENTER LEGISLATIVE
                    PROPOSAL</head>

                <p>WHEREAS, the Board of Visitors has reviewed a proposed legislative action to
                    amend Section 23.77.3(A) of the <hi rend="underline">Code of Virginia</hi> to
                    provide that the Medical Center will be deemed to be a licensed hospital or a
                    licensed health care provider in order for the Medical Center to receive the
                    privileges, immunities, benefits and/or rights afforded licensed hospitals under
                    Virginia law; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the Board of Visitors concludes that the proposed changes are prudent
                    and in the best interest of the University;</p>
                <p> RESOLVED that the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer is
                    authorized to seek legislation accomplishing the above-described purpose.</p>
                <ornament type="characters">------------</ornament>
                <p>The second legislative amendment seeks a definition of "hazing" from the General
                    Assembly. At present, hazing is a criminal offense under the <hi
                        rend="underline">Code of Virginia</hi>, which requires that offenders be
                    expelled from school. The law, however, makes no distinction among
                    manifestations of hazing, which has raised questions about the proportionality
                    of offenses and the mandatory punishment.</p>
                <p>On motion, the Board approved the following resolution:</p>

                <p><name>Mr. Farrell</name>, as Chair of the Buildings and Grounds Committee,
                    offered a resolution approving the schematic and preliminary design for the
                    South Addition to Campbell Hall; the resolution had been approved earlier by the
                    Committee and approval by the full Board was required.</p>

                    the Secretary opined that although Board of Visitors approval of this action
                    might not be necessary, there was reason to feel that action by the full Board
                    might not be superfluous.</p>
